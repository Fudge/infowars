[00:00:05.635 --> 00:00:06.275]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.936 --> 00:00:08.017]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:09.838]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:11.319]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.920]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.262]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.782 --> 00:00:21.925]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.426 --> 00:00:32.972]  This is going to be one of the most, if not most, important broadcasts I have ever made that you are tuned into today.
[00:00:35.983 --> 00:00:44.425]  We have a vicious pincer attack that America is caught in the jaws of right now.
[00:00:45.565 --> 00:00:59.249]  Total, complete, absolute amnesty, amnesty plus is what it is, is set to be passed as early as Monday and then will sail through the House directly to the President's desk.
[00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:03.350]  Bush has hailed a deal with Senators and members of the House, the leadership,
[00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.833]  And it's the same M.O., the same signature we've seen every time they run a putsch, a coup d'etat against the people.
[00:01:11.793 --> 00:01:27.340]  The thousand-plus page bill will not be allowed to be seen until Monday, but it has been leaked by different senators that it is the Kennedy bill, and that it's even got some new things added to it.
[00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:31.781]  Absolute, total, high treason.
[00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:33.221]  And I mean it when I say that.
[00:01:33.582 --> 00:01:49.230]  The people that vote for this are treasonous traitors, and when we take the country back, they need to be arrested and they need to, at the bare minimum, after they're found guilty by a jury, spend the rest of their lives in prison.
[00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.812]  This is high treason.
[00:01:53.726 --> 00:02:01.909]  That is being committed by Kennedy and Bush and that entire pack of larcenous criminal vermin.
[00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:03.930]  I do not have words.
[00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.592]  I literally had trouble going to sleep last night despite the fact that I had literally had almost no sleep the night before.
[00:02:10.632 --> 00:02:13.793]  My wife's sick, taking care of her and the children waking up.
[00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.571]  I literally woke up four or five times last night upset over this.
[00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:22.372]  I can feel that everything is coming to a head.
[00:02:22.492 --> 00:02:28.393]  I don't just feel it, I see it intellectually and in a cold way, mathematically assessing things.
[00:02:28.754 --> 00:02:37.576]  Just as Aaron Russo said yesterday, I'm going to go over the immigration first and then the Ron Paul situation is dire.
[00:02:38.334 --> 00:02:48.360]  The Republican leadership, we have confirmed, coast-to-coast, is moving and is lobbying to ban him from the next three and final debates, deciding on who the Republican nominee will be.
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.164]  That is deciding who will, quote, be the front-runner and who will win the nomination.
[00:02:58.746 --> 00:03:00.847]  Who will win the primaries and then the nomination.
[00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:03.728]  Who will get the Republican nomination.
[00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.729]  So much is riding on this.
[00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.390]  That's the other
[00:03:07.168 --> 00:03:08.089]  side of the attack.
[00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.410]  Of course, it's more than a pincer.
[00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.853]  We're being hit from all sides, every point of the compass, every degree of the compass.
[00:03:16.773 --> 00:03:23.157]  We have the dollar in absolute freefall, gas prices in a straight-up rocket curve.
[00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:31.561]  We have the war spiraling completely out of control and escalating again in Lebanon.
[00:03:35.063 --> 00:03:42.468]  It was Lennon that said, the evil genius that he was, that there are times when more happens in a week or a month than happened in the previous hundred years.
[00:03:42.968 --> 00:03:46.570]  We are in that time right now.
[00:03:47.691 --> 00:03:49.452]  We are in that time right now.
[00:03:50.973 --> 00:04:04.641]  You know, in between being disgusted and horrified and nauseated, I also am exhilarated at the same time, it is a paradox, to be alive right now and to be a prominent
[00:04:05.367 --> 00:04:21.600]  Human being, head up against wickedness, that I have been honored enough to be on this field, this field where it isn't a game, where it's mortal combat, literally against an elite who traffic in the souls of men.
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.543]  What do you think Madison Avenue and this culture does?
[00:04:25.643 --> 00:04:25.983]  It does.
[00:04:26.063 --> 00:04:27.825]  It steals your soul.
[00:04:27.845 --> 00:04:33.489]  I remember being in Sunday School when I was 10 years old and hearing they trafficked, they sold the souls of men.
[00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:34.510]  I don't know what that meant.
[00:04:35.365 --> 00:04:43.489]  They literally traffic in people like Hasselhoff's, Elizabeth Hasselbeck's souls.
[00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:44.570]  They literally traffic.
[00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.270]  I mean, look at them.
[00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.871]  They're soulless husk.
[00:04:48.672 --> 00:04:51.573]  We'll tell you exactly what's happening with total, complete amnesty.
[00:04:52.574 --> 00:04:54.735]  Amron Paul on the other side.
[00:05:03.072 --> 00:05:14.326]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:21.015]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[00:05:21.255 --> 00:05:21.895]  We're good to go!

[00:05:48.471 --> 00:05:49.032]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.

[00:05:50.873 --> 00:05:51.533]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.736]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:10.097 --> 00:06:17.705]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.436 --> 00:06:25.481]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.882 --> 00:06:37.310]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.093]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.593 --> 00:06:43.515]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.855 --> 00:06:47.698]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:01.141 --> 00:07:05.405]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:07:05.645 --> 00:07:10.489]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:12.110]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.613]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[00:07:15.873 --> 00:07:21.037]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[00:07:27.382 --> 00:07:29.803]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[00:07:29.883 --> 00:07:32.223]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.

[00:07:36.044 --> 00:07:36.964]  No animal testing.
[00:07:37.244 --> 00:07:38.545]  I use them and love them.
[00:07:38.565 --> 00:07:40.165]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[00:07:40.465 --> 00:07:41.585]  And I say big time.
[00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:43.466]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:07:43.586 --> 00:07:43.906]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[00:07:53.328 --> 00:07:59.856]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:08.647]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.248 --> 00:08:12.232]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:34.514]  Alright, there are different levels and different rings and different defenses in the New World Order's lives.
[00:08:35.575 --> 00:08:39.718]  As the old saying goes, wheels within wheels within wheels.
[00:08:41.619 --> 00:08:53.406]  On the face of it, Republican and Democratic leaders and most neocon talk show hosts get up on air and say that this is not an amnesty plan, that this gets tough on illegal aliens.
[00:08:55.279 --> 00:09:04.846]  The total amnesty plan that we've been fighting for the last six years, that is set to be passed and signed by the would-be dictator next week.
[00:09:06.987 --> 00:09:09.589]  Now, number one, it isn't an amnesty.
[00:09:09.629 --> 00:09:10.169]  That's true.
[00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.971]  It is the end of America.
[00:09:12.671 --> 00:09:18.335]  Amnesty would be like Reagan saying, we're going to legalize a million people, and then it was really six and a half million.
[00:09:19.716 --> 00:09:21.117]  Okay, that was just an amnesty.
[00:09:21.812 --> 00:09:24.613]  And we were told it was the last one ever and boy they were going to get tough after that.
[00:09:25.014 --> 00:09:25.994]  Total smoke and mirrors.
[00:09:26.614 --> 00:09:34.738]  Now we have conservatively, with real federal census and state census numbers, not 14 million like the media says, over 30 million.
[00:09:35.018 --> 00:09:36.319]  That's a two year old number.
[00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:45.163]  It's estimated with 3 million a year coming in plus a million legal, that we're talking about 36 plus million.
[00:09:46.043 --> 00:09:46.523]  Alright?
[00:09:47.244 --> 00:09:50.085]  We've gone through all those numbers, all those statistics, those are accurate.
[00:09:50.786 --> 00:09:54.347]  If you want to be super conservative, twenty-six million, okay?
[00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:58.349]  Probably over thirty million, could be as high as thirty-six million.
[00:09:58.909 --> 00:10:13.594]  Thirty-six million foreigners, eighty-four percent of them, was it eighty-three or eighty-four percent, that are Mexican nationals who are highly nationalistic and highly anti-US.
[00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:17.622]  So, let's just be conservative.
[00:10:17.662 --> 00:10:23.546]  We got 26 million illegal aliens in this country now.
[00:10:25.035 --> 00:10:31.578]  And this will allow them to bring in their entire families and their extended families.
[00:10:31.638 --> 00:10:39.141]  The congressional report says it will allow them to bring in at least 11 family members.
[00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:45.384]  Then the cycle can be started over again in four years where they can bring in that many family members.
[00:10:45.684 --> 00:10:50.426]  It's called chain immigration, chain migration.
[00:10:51.246 --> 00:10:52.546]  Now I'm going to give you action alerts.
[00:10:52.566 --> 00:10:53.627]  I'm going to give you phone numbers.
[00:10:54.227 --> 00:10:56.388]  Wait a minute, I had it in my stack and now it's not here.
[00:10:56.408 --> 00:10:57.388]  I think I left it at home.
[00:10:58.548 --> 00:11:02.409]  Hey guys, will you bring me several numbers for the Capitol, Switchboard, and the U.S.
[00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:05.150]  Senate, because I don't want to give out just one number.
[00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.930]  It'll jam up.
[00:11:06.531 --> 00:11:07.511]  Later we'll open the phones up.
[00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:09.772]  Listeners can give us individual extensions if you want.
[00:11:10.272 --> 00:11:13.473]  I've been trying to track which senators are for it, but they're being real secretive.
[00:11:13.873 --> 00:11:17.294]  We're going to go over all of it, but let me just state the facts here, then we'll get into Ron Paul.
[00:11:20.293 --> 00:11:21.975]  Let me just break this down for everybody.
[00:11:22.817 --> 00:11:28.064]  All the talk, all the anger, everybody being upset, everybody being concerned, it's now coming to a head.
[00:11:28.324 --> 00:11:30.067]  You see, everything's happening right now.
[00:11:30.954 --> 00:11:32.655]  Everything's going on right now.
[00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:33.716]  This is the time.
[00:11:34.216 --> 00:11:35.596]  This is the time on Ron Paul.
[00:11:35.837 --> 00:11:37.097]  This is the time on the borders.
[00:11:37.337 --> 00:11:39.038]  This is the time on the North American Union.
[00:11:39.238 --> 00:11:43.701]  This is the time on the giant TransNav to highway toll roads to fund the North American Union.
[00:11:43.941 --> 00:11:46.782]  This is the time on the global warming carbon tax.
[00:11:47.323 --> 00:11:49.864]  Everything is happening now.
[00:11:50.264 --> 00:11:51.745]  It's happening right now.
[00:11:53.482 --> 00:11:58.746]  And it's just going to get more and more chaotic and wild in the next couple years.
[00:11:59.147 --> 00:12:01.869]  But right now, ladies and gentlemen, the battle is joined.
[00:12:02.129 --> 00:12:05.352]  The war has gotten a lot hotter in the last few days.
[00:12:07.714 --> 00:12:14.479]  And when you're in this fight so long, sometimes the enemy overruns you before you realize that it's been a whole new wave, wave attack that you're under.
[00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:21.341]  So, number one, they tell you it's not amnesty, they're going to get tough on illegals.
[00:12:21.561 --> 00:12:23.283]  It is worse than amnesty.
[00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:28.307]  It allows, and they're reporting that it is, the Kennedy bill with some things added.
[00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:32.892]  Because Republicans that are in the Senate Conference Committee
[00:12:33.624 --> 00:12:48.308]  Because they're already trying to line it up with the House, so they can vote it out of conference, bring it right into the House, it's got all the steamroller earmarks on it, over a thousand pages, and Senators are going public going, I've seen part of the bill, it is amnesty.
[00:12:48.928 --> 00:12:50.968]  I have their reports, the Senate reports right here.
[00:12:51.329 --> 00:12:52.929]  And see, that's an even bigger news item!
[00:12:53.596 --> 00:12:54.677]  It's secret from us!
[00:12:55.097 --> 00:12:56.237]  Just like everything else.
[00:12:56.557 --> 00:12:59.119]  Just like the North American Union, SPP.
[00:12:59.439 --> 00:13:01.180]  Just like Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.221]  Just like everything else they do.
[00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:20.369]  When they're planning to do a backroom, slit-the-throat type, stab you in the back, down and dirty, grand theft larceny of our republic, every time these bastards engage in treason, they do it where they bring the bill out to a full vote when no one's read it.
[00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:24.406]  Now it should be illegal for them to vote on a bill they haven't read.
[00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:27.814]  There is a Read the Bills Act that downsizes D.C.
[00:13:28.175 --> 00:13:31.143]  A good lobbying group of Libertarians has been bringing up the last five years.
[00:13:31.923 --> 00:13:35.564]  But forget not even reading it, they don't even have a chance!
[00:13:36.044 --> 00:13:50.568]  They bring that sucker right out on the floor, and the only people that have read it, and in between all their mistresses, male and female, and in between their golfing and their different palaces and their Swiss bank accounts, even the committee chairman, generally haven't read the whole thing.
[00:13:50.628 --> 00:13:52.229]  It's written by special interest.
[00:13:52.729 --> 00:13:58.553]  La Raza, Mecha, the big councils, the big industrial councils have written this.
[00:13:58.854 --> 00:14:04.138]  Been a bunch of lobbyists in there writing this thing and changing it around for the last five, six years.
[00:14:04.638 --> 00:14:09.421]  And people that have seen it in the committee say it is the worst one ever.
[00:14:10.362 --> 00:14:14.645]  And you can tell when it's the real deal because again they're saying you're not allowed to see it.
[00:14:15.466 --> 00:14:16.266]  Think about this.
[00:14:17.087 --> 00:14:19.769]  Think about the treason that we're witnessing.
[00:14:22.159 --> 00:14:23.279]  And then the deception!
[00:14:23.339 --> 00:14:28.141]  Now, yesterday afternoon, last night, I monitored enemy transmissions.
[00:14:29.461 --> 00:14:33.763]  The Judas Goats of fake conservative talk radio.
[00:14:33.783 --> 00:14:36.704]  They're there to neutralize and pacify conservatives.
[00:14:37.684 --> 00:14:42.285]  Sean Hannity was being deceptive, going, well, we gotta do something, at least he gives us a fence.
[00:14:42.845 --> 00:14:44.086]  We gotta track these people.
[00:14:44.146 --> 00:14:47.667]  He was spinning of, oh, he's against immigration,
[00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.492]  Open borders, wide open illegal immigration, but we've got to have this compromise.
[00:14:54.172 --> 00:15:07.039]  Other people, like Neil Bortz, were telling the truth, saying that it's amnesty, but they weren't calling it high treason, and they weren't giving phone numbers out to the Congress, and if shows like that did give out the number, it would be over.
[00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:08.720]  Okay?
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.120]  It's that simple.
[00:15:11.741 --> 00:15:12.461]  It's that simple.
[00:15:15.083 --> 00:15:17.824]  And I told you last night, I was losing sleep.
[00:15:18.627 --> 00:15:19.708]  Because I love this country.
[00:15:19.928 --> 00:15:20.968]  I know it's where I live.
[00:15:21.268 --> 00:15:23.109]  It's where my forefathers and mothers are from.
[00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.930]  It's where I want to raise my family.
[00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:26.411]  I want to stay in Texas.
[00:15:27.031 --> 00:15:31.134]  I want my great-grandchildren to grow up here, when there's, you know, spaceports in Houston.
[00:15:31.634 --> 00:15:32.754]  I mean, I am a Texan.
[00:15:32.835 --> 00:15:33.555]  I am an American.
[00:15:34.055 --> 00:15:35.356]  And it is part of my body.
[00:15:35.856 --> 00:15:39.038]  It is literally in my soul, and it is twisting me inside.
[00:15:39.058 --> 00:15:41.499]  And I am feeling violent, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:41.819 --> 00:15:42.820]  And I know you are, too.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.360]  I know.
[00:15:44.201 --> 00:15:45.801]  And we don't want that.
[00:15:45.841 --> 00:15:46.822]  We want to be peaceful.
[00:15:49.582 --> 00:15:51.343]  But this is high treason!
[00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:52.844]  There is no debating it!
[00:15:53.665 --> 00:16:06.094]  Folks, I've got news here in front of me, I haven't even gotten to yet, that literally, last night, I was doing research at about 11 for the film, and I literally got a splitting headache when I read it.
[00:16:07.255 --> 00:16:08.756]  I'm going to tell you about it coming up in a few minutes.
[00:16:10.117 --> 00:16:11.718]  Well, it's what we already knew.
[00:16:11.738 --> 00:16:14.180]  By the way, they're already doing it, but they're now announcing it.
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.563]  You thought 20-plus percent of the army being illegal aliens, now legalized, was bad.
[00:16:19.548 --> 00:16:21.670]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're about to make the police departments.
[00:16:23.352 --> 00:16:24.613]  Foreign National Mexicans.
[00:16:24.714 --> 00:16:25.835]  My God, we're in trouble.
[00:16:27.196 --> 00:16:27.797]  Oh my God.
[00:16:28.317 --> 00:16:29.278]  It's AP, folks.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.801]  Fine, I just told you.
[00:16:33.323 --> 00:16:34.244]  I just got a headache again.
[00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:34.964]  Hold on just a minute.
[00:16:37.927 --> 00:16:42.092]  I'm serious, I get a splitting headache because see, my normal response would be to overturn this desk.
[00:16:43.206 --> 00:16:45.466]  And just starts punching holes in the walls, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:45.567 --> 00:16:48.907]  I cannot handle this humiliation.
[00:16:49.127 --> 00:16:50.768]  No country puts up with this.
[00:16:51.148 --> 00:16:52.888]  No one ever goes through this.
[00:16:53.188 --> 00:16:55.028]  We are so pathetic.
[00:16:55.869 --> 00:17:01.310]  And I have to look at these oiled, effeminate men in their little fancy suits.
[00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.450]  They're always adjusting their ties and pinkie rings.
[00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.910]  You know what I mean?
[00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.111]  They're all real into themselves and into their fancy cars.
[00:17:07.351 --> 00:17:09.971]  They're not into anything real or substantive.
[00:17:09.991 --> 00:17:10.972]  They have no honor.
[00:17:11.192 --> 00:17:12.852]  They're just these empty little husks.
[00:17:13.638 --> 00:17:26.566]  I mean, I don't have words to describe it when you see them adjusting and moving around in their seats up on Fox and enjoying power and enjoying being traitors and enjoying killing this country and they've all got a stake in it.
[00:17:27.226 --> 00:17:28.707]  My parents were over for dinner last night.
[00:17:28.727 --> 00:17:31.188]  She says, yeah, I watch Fox News.
[00:17:31.228 --> 00:17:32.929]  It's like they all have a stake in it.
[00:17:32.949 --> 00:17:33.730]  Like they're desperate.
[00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:34.530]  Like they're afraid.
[00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:35.251]  And they are.
[00:17:35.311 --> 00:17:36.552]  They know they're criminals.
[00:17:36.892 --> 00:17:39.073]  Wolf Blitzer is a Mossad agent.
[00:17:39.453 --> 00:17:42.055]  Of course he has a stake in it over at CNN.
[00:17:43.007 --> 00:17:45.509]  The guy used to be the top APEC lobbyist.
[00:17:45.949 --> 00:17:47.650]  You don't have that unless you're Mossad.
[00:17:48.371 --> 00:17:53.774]  And the other people, they all represent different corporations, different globalist arms, and they're scared to death!
[00:17:54.134 --> 00:17:55.295]  They know what they're doing!
[00:17:55.475 --> 00:17:57.717]  They know it's cold-blooded to kill America!
[00:17:58.177 --> 00:17:59.318]  And they know they're doing it!
[00:17:59.758 --> 00:18:01.159]  That's why they're so serious!
[00:18:03.467 --> 00:18:07.970]  You know, at least you can look at Hannity and tell he knows what he's doing is evil and he's serious and Blitzer's serious.
[00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:14.553]  Some of them, like Steele with Gopack and Bush and all of them, they start laughing and giggling and snickering.
[00:18:14.773 --> 00:18:16.074]  It's so much fun!
[00:18:22.497 --> 00:18:23.958]  And John Gibson, all of them.
[00:18:24.018 --> 00:18:26.580]  It's so much fun to kill this country!
[00:18:28.701 --> 00:18:30.622]  And make no mistake, that's what they're doing.
[00:18:33.169 --> 00:18:40.152]  It's so much fun to be these arrogant, puffed-up nobodies for some 20, 30 pieces of silver.
[00:18:40.532 --> 00:18:52.097]  And let me tell you, just very soon, you don't have to worry about us coming after you, New World Order, because a lot of these servants out there listening, you're going to look at the horrible things you've done, and those 30 pieces of silver aren't going to be anything in your hands.
[00:18:53.778 --> 00:18:57.059]  It's going to mean nothing to you, just like Judas of old.
[00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:02.141]  Judas Iscariot.
[00:19:03.587 --> 00:19:04.888]  Don't be a Judas.
[00:19:04.928 --> 00:19:06.568]  I know for most of you it's too far gone.
[00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:09.550]  It's like a, it's like, they remind me of male cheerleaders.
[00:19:10.751 --> 00:19:13.032]  And I'm not knocking people who have been male cheerleaders, but you know what I mean.
[00:19:13.052 --> 00:19:18.114]  You know, that look, that fake smile, that running around with their chest sticking out, all feeling good.
[00:19:18.134 --> 00:19:23.257]  And they're all like in a sick club.
[00:19:23.277 --> 00:19:32.141]  And they all just, just like a bunch of pops and pimps, like a bunch of little dogs jumping around at their master's knee when he comes in the door.
[00:19:32.904 --> 00:19:35.526]  They're just excitedly running the country through!
[00:19:35.546 --> 00:19:35.606]  Ugh!
[00:19:41.631 --> 00:19:43.532]  Alright, you know, I've done my ranting.
[00:19:43.572 --> 00:19:50.157]  I've got to calmly go through this amnesty, and then calmly go through the foreign occupation that's going to happen.
[00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:56.542]  I'll tell you right now, folks, foreign cops pull me over and want to do stuff to my family, I can't control myself at that point.
[00:19:56.582 --> 00:19:56.902]  It's over.
[00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:05.481]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:20:05.521 --> 00:20:06.022]  are located?
[00:20:06.242 --> 00:20:09.626]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:20:09.846 --> 00:20:14.551]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:20:14.851 --> 00:20:19.837]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:20:20.097 --> 00:20:26.121]  Brewing environmental catastrophes, the safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.
[00:20:26.401 --> 00:20:38.409]  Complete with three gigabytes of detailed information on each of 3,000 plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis
[00:20:38.649 --> 00:20:40.310]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:21:08.303 --> 00:21:13.126]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:21:13.347 --> 00:21:16.089]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:21:16.129 --> 00:21:17.229]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:23.193]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:24.114 --> 00:21:31.379]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.422]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:37.572 --> 00:21:41.036]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:21:41.996 --> 00:21:43.298]  Call for your copy today.
[00:21:43.518 --> 00:21:45.740]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.801 --> 00:21:52.647]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:21:53.348 --> 00:21:53.748]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.808 --> 00:21:54.008]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.375 --> 00:22:04.417]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:05.038 --> 00:22:13.968]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.408 --> 00:22:21.636]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:22.357 --> 00:22:23.899]  But now, it's cancer
[00:22:25.166 --> 00:22:39.150]  With LaceMedInc's patented methodology, without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.951]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:22:42.451 --> 00:22:43.871]  For more information, call 702-953-0268.
[00:22:49.497 --> 00:22:49.738]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:23:02.267 --> 00:23:04.609]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:05.129 --> 00:23:11.913]  Did you know that an FBI agent assigned to the White House when Bill Clinton took office wrote a book entitled Unlimited Access?
[00:23:12.633 --> 00:23:19.997]  He told of Clinton's staff coming into the White House its first day with red buttons on their shirt with a picture of the first communist dictator, V.I.
[00:23:20.077 --> 00:23:20.698]  Lenin, on them.
[00:23:21.578 --> 00:23:26.262]  Is it any wonder the United States government moved further to the left during the Clinton administration?
[00:23:26.882 --> 00:23:30.865]  Even Hillary tried to pass a socialistic program for health care.
[00:23:31.465 --> 00:23:38.971]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:39.831 --> 00:23:41.292]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:41.312 --> 00:23:41.652]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:41.672 --> 00:23:42.112]  Call now.
[00:23:42.132 --> 00:23:47.475]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:24:10.683 --> 00:24:11.765]  Stand up!
[00:24:11.805 --> 00:24:13.688]  Stand up for your rights!
[00:24:13.768 --> 00:24:14.890]  Get up!
[00:24:14.931 --> 00:24:15.492]  Stand up!
[00:24:25.362 --> 00:24:26.003]  Welcome back.
[00:24:26.543 --> 00:24:27.604]  Let me just lay it out.
[00:24:31.187 --> 00:24:33.569]  This bill is more than amnesty.
[00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:37.313]  It is the foreign occupation of the United States.
[00:24:37.533 --> 00:24:39.835]  It is the birth of the North American Union.
[00:24:39.855 --> 00:24:42.537]  I know Steve Watson is doing research on this, writing an article.
[00:24:42.577 --> 00:24:43.958]  I mean, I don't know what headline we should have.
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.261]  I mean, how do we ring the alarm bells?
[00:24:47.301 --> 00:24:50.044]  How do we find words for how bad it is?
[00:24:51.864 --> 00:25:00.368]  This is total amnesty and the end of internal borders in North America.
[00:25:01.229 --> 00:25:03.590]  They have stated that it's a worker ID.
[00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:07.692]  It's on the same standardized system as the REAL ID Act.
[00:25:07.792 --> 00:25:10.513]  It's a North American Union citizen.
[00:25:11.413 --> 00:25:20.798]  Just as Robert Pasteur said a few weeks ago before Congress, the guy that wrote this legislation up, the guy that set up the CFR committee, that came up with the SPP plan.
[00:25:22.296 --> 00:25:24.278]  He says we're not going to have internal borders.
[00:25:24.298 --> 00:25:27.400]  We're going to have an external border for North America.
[00:25:28.742 --> 00:25:30.483]  Free-flowing superhighways.
[00:25:30.503 --> 00:25:36.248]  They're going to use the toll road money from Texas to finish the roads down into Mexico to bring stuff even faster.
[00:25:36.508 --> 00:25:37.809]  Our own money to destroy us.
[00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:39.931]  It allows chain migration.
[00:25:40.712 --> 00:25:48.759]  Illegal aliens on average spend close to three times in welfare and anchor baby cost having their children.
[00:25:49.545 --> 00:25:50.186]  They come here.
[00:25:50.226 --> 00:25:50.846]  They fly in.
[00:25:50.886 --> 00:25:54.049]  Now it was in the news that South Koreans are doing it by the tens of thousands every year.
[00:25:54.409 --> 00:25:58.813]  They fly in, in their third trimester, two weeks before they have a baby.
[00:25:58.853 --> 00:25:59.954]  They stay in a hotel.
[00:26:00.174 --> 00:26:02.195]  Their water breaks and they go into the hospital.
[00:26:02.476 --> 00:26:05.458]  And then the kids are citizen and the husband and wife get to stay.
[00:26:06.919 --> 00:26:10.322]  We're not bashing Mexicans here from Mexico.
[00:26:10.362 --> 00:26:11.583]  We're not singling you out.
[00:26:11.863 --> 00:26:13.605]  It's that you're 80 plus percent of it.
[00:26:15.286 --> 00:26:16.667]  Conservatively, 26 million.
[00:26:20.171 --> 00:26:22.352]  On the high end, 30 plus million?
[00:26:26.133 --> 00:26:31.476]  In the country, and in the government, is making the legislation secret.
[00:26:32.756 --> 00:26:34.877]  But Senators, and I've got the reports right here.
[00:26:34.897 --> 00:26:37.098]  Get them from the stack here for you.
[00:26:39.924 --> 00:26:42.206]  Bush hails deal on immigration reform.
[00:26:42.226 --> 00:26:44.647]  And then he goes out and that's the first ring.
[00:26:44.667 --> 00:26:45.208]  We're getting tough.
[00:26:45.228 --> 00:26:46.068]  We're going to build a fence.
[00:26:46.509 --> 00:26:50.392]  Then you read, remember they funded the fence last year and Chertoff said no we're not going to build it.
[00:26:51.272 --> 00:26:52.653]  We're going to keep that money for something else.
[00:26:53.654 --> 00:26:54.675]  It's all smoke and mirrors.
[00:26:54.695 --> 00:26:55.955]  They're not building any fence.
[00:26:56.416 --> 00:26:58.657]  I mean they're building a few miles of it here and there for show.
[00:26:58.958 --> 00:27:01.039]  They put a few hundred guard troops in a few spots.
[00:27:01.619 --> 00:27:04.602]  They're not allowed to shoot back when Mexican troops come across shooting at them.
[00:27:04.802 --> 00:27:05.542]  They run.
[00:27:06.983 --> 00:27:09.125]  Bush hails deal on immigration reform.
[00:27:11.895 --> 00:27:12.915]  Get ready USA!
[00:27:12.995 --> 00:27:13.935]  Amnesty is on its way!
[00:27:13.955 --> 00:27:17.376]  I've got my article here with the U.S.
[00:27:17.416 --> 00:27:20.997]  Senator saying the new bill is Amnesty.
[00:27:21.797 --> 00:27:23.097]  Now, of course, it's not in my stack.
[00:27:23.157 --> 00:27:27.078]  Guys, will you run that into me or I'll... I'm so flustered, I'll get it during the next break.
[00:27:27.118 --> 00:27:29.338]  I'll go over to the Senator that's seen sections of it.
[00:27:29.698 --> 00:27:31.258]  But we know it's the Kennedy bill.
[00:27:31.498 --> 00:27:32.839]  Kennedy's out there endorsing it.
[00:27:34.259 --> 00:27:41.000]  You've got Grill Halva, who's openly called for Larry Conquista, who I've had on, the representative on.
[00:27:41.846 --> 00:27:42.607]  From Arizona.
[00:27:42.927 --> 00:27:44.668]  He's endorsing it.
[00:27:44.708 --> 00:27:51.614]  And then they fool conservatives and pro-Americans by having a few immigrant groups come out and protest it.
[00:27:53.436 --> 00:27:56.999]  Because it's not... It doesn't say amnesty.
[00:27:57.059 --> 00:27:58.480]  It's just a stealth amnesty.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.401]  Don't worry.
[00:27:59.681 --> 00:28:04.184]  Let your master sneak up and stab the country in the back from behind.
[00:28:04.205 --> 00:28:05.506]  No, no, no, no.
[00:28:05.546 --> 00:28:07.027]  They want it from up front.
[00:28:08.303 --> 00:28:10.925]  And your masters are going, no, no, no, no, no, don't do that.
[00:28:11.446 --> 00:28:12.467]  They might fight back.
[00:28:12.767 --> 00:28:20.954]  Let us sneak up, grab around the head, restrain the head, and draw the knife with a lot of pressure across both of the main arteries in the throat.
[00:28:23.396 --> 00:28:30.602]  And so they have you out there protesting like complete idiots that it's not amnesty when it's total amnesty, and then Limbaugh
[00:28:31.301 --> 00:28:39.448]  And Hannity can get on there and lie, and I've heard them doing it for months, and go, well, it's not perfect, but you know it's sensible, and at least it'll get IDs on them.
[00:28:39.888 --> 00:28:41.049]  They don't need IDs!
[00:28:41.089 --> 00:28:46.493]  Homeland Security said they don't need IDs to get bank accounts, have housing loans, or car loans!
[00:28:47.594 --> 00:28:55.020]  It's if they want, they can go pay the $1,500 and sign up for it, and then bring 11 of their family members over.
[00:28:55.641 --> 00:28:56.902]  It just gives them more options.
[00:28:58.303 --> 00:29:06.668]  He just accelerates legal immigration and legalizes the 26 million people that are here who can then bring 11 of their family members.
[00:29:07.608 --> 00:29:09.329]  Who then, 4 years later, can bring another 11.
[00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.812]  You see, they had an amnesty of 1 million, turned out to be over 6 in the mid-80s.
[00:29:16.453 --> 00:29:18.494]  What, the 86 amnesty?
[00:29:19.094 --> 00:29:23.517]  And then, they're having a new amnesty, but there's already, hey, there's already an amnesty.
[00:29:24.426 --> 00:29:27.927]  The cops have been told, don't arrest them, leave them alone, let them not have insurance.
[00:29:28.508 --> 00:29:29.888]  I mean, that's already been in the news.
[00:29:30.628 --> 00:29:31.569]  You can pull up the articles.
[00:29:32.109 --> 00:29:32.889]  They don't get arrested.
[00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:36.390]  Now when we get back, the big news, the big headline.
[00:29:36.951 --> 00:29:39.832]  This is why it isn't just amnesty, it's foreign occupation.
[00:29:40.692 --> 00:29:42.733]  Mexico knows how to run things, folks.
[00:29:43.033 --> 00:29:48.475]  And the New World Order chased Manhattan and Citibank that owns Mexico is just going to import the Mexican government here
[00:29:49.489 --> 00:29:51.810]  As their management, you're gonna live like a peon.
[00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:52.710]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.830]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:58.471]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.411 --> 00:30:02.592]  So you take care of your car.
[00:30:02.752 --> 00:30:03.632]  You change the oil.
[00:30:03.772 --> 00:30:05.092]  Tune it up on a regular basis.
[00:30:05.352 --> 00:30:07.373]  And always make sure that it's running at its best.
[00:30:07.613 --> 00:30:09.913]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[00:30:10.193 --> 00:30:13.474]  That's why you need SFR's Protekta synthetic oil treatments.
[00:30:13.674 --> 00:30:14.794]  Protekta engine treatment.
[00:30:14.974 --> 00:30:16.315]  Protekta transmission treatment.
[00:30:16.555 --> 00:30:18.435]  And Protekta complete fuel system treatment.
[00:30:18.695 --> 00:30:26.445]  Protecta meets the demands you put on your vehicle by providing more horsepower, improving gas mileage, decreasing emissions, and promotes longer engine life.

[00:32:05.931 --> 00:32:09.814]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[00:32:10.174 --> 00:32:15.197]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[00:32:15.457 --> 00:32:26.643]  Electrolyzed Plus Water will alkalinize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens, become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.

[00:32:51.028 --> 00:32:51.208]  That's 888-212-8871.
[00:32:51.308 --> 00:32:52.389]  Or go to Nutramedical.com.
[00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.091]  That's N-U-T-R-I with an I, medical.com.
[00:33:19.333 --> 00:33:27.757]  We're going to have open phones later in this hour, definitely in the second hour, and then for the last 30-40 minutes of the show, I'm going to have the Loose Change men on the crew.
[00:33:28.718 --> 00:33:38.703]  I'm an executive producer on Loose Change Final Cut, and we'll be giving you more details of that since it started leaking out in the last few days, so I went ahead and just set the record straight.
[00:33:38.743 --> 00:33:44.406]  I was getting calls and emails like, I hear you're the producer, I hear you're the... I'm like, no, I'm an executive producer.
[00:33:44.426 --> 00:33:47.007]  So I don't know how this stuff gets out, but it always does.
[00:33:47.999 --> 00:33:50.160]  So we'll let you know exactly what's happening with that later.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.200]  That certainly is important.
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:55.941]  Big developments with Rosie O'Donnell openly saying that most terror is government-sponsored.
[00:33:56.361 --> 00:33:57.442]  We'll be playing that later.
[00:33:57.502 --> 00:34:03.363]  William Rodriguez will also be popping in talking about how he and the Loose Change crew are going to be on the 24th on The View live.
[00:34:05.024 --> 00:34:11.005]  By live, they shoot it and then now they delay it like 10-15 minutes because the Neocon producer likes to edit things out.
[00:34:11.025 --> 00:34:11.966]  That's why Rosie's leaving.
[00:34:12.626 --> 00:34:13.666]  So that's all coming up.
[00:34:13.726 --> 00:34:15.267]  But let me just stop and settle down here.
[00:34:15.307 --> 00:34:16.467]  First off, I want to thank my crew.
[00:34:17.302 --> 00:34:21.383]  Aaron Dykes, Ryan Slickheisen, Paul Watson, Steve Watson.
[00:34:22.483 --> 00:34:23.363]  We're a small crew.
[00:34:23.383 --> 00:34:24.104]  We're getting a lot done.
[00:34:24.124 --> 00:34:24.924]  I want to thank Steve.
[00:34:24.944 --> 00:34:28.144]  He's already written a couple articles today for PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:28.164 --> 00:34:34.306]  He's writing an article right now on the total amnesty means occupation of U.S.
[00:34:35.386 --> 00:34:38.247]  But I mean, it really, again, I don't have the personnel.
[00:34:38.287 --> 00:34:44.208]  I guess I need to write or somebody else needs to write an article just about the deceptive way, the deceptive way
[00:34:45.186 --> 00:34:47.767]  I mean, I know you can put it all in one article, but then it doesn't get read.
[00:34:47.787 --> 00:34:54.389]  We need to break it up into several smaller articles, that they're gonna try to pass it in secret, let no one read it, and then they admit this?
[00:34:54.509 --> 00:34:57.150]  I mean, this is just, it's so corrupt!
[00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:10.514]  And then all the people that have legally come here, and legally gone through all the hoops, and they just say, oh, well, if you're an illegal alien, we'll just legalize you, and they're gonna reward that, which is only gonna accelerate
[00:35:11.877 --> 00:35:15.560]  When they had the million people giving amnesty, it turned out to be over six million.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:20.382]  It was because people rushed the border then to come up and get their amnesty.
[00:35:20.442 --> 00:35:21.623]  I mean, you think it's bad now?
[00:35:21.703 --> 00:35:22.284]  You watch.
[00:35:23.064 --> 00:35:24.705]  You think the border's being overrun now?
[00:35:24.785 --> 00:35:25.365]  Just wait.
[00:35:28.607 --> 00:35:31.629]  Senator, no matter how you spin it, this is amnesty.
[00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.311]  This is Senator Jim DeMint's
[00:35:36.439 --> 00:35:45.210]  I hope we don't take a thousand page bill written in secret and try to ram it through the Senate in a few days.
[00:35:45.631 --> 00:35:48.595]  This is a very important issue for America and we need time to debate it.
[00:35:49.204 --> 00:35:51.825]  But the little we do know about the bill is troubling.
[00:35:51.865 --> 00:36:00.669]  According to reports, the bill contains a new Z-Visa that allows those who enter the country illegally to stay here permanently without ever returning home.
[00:36:01.289 --> 00:36:05.911]  I mean, before you had to at least go over for a few days and come back.
[00:36:06.231 --> 00:36:07.612]  This just makes it so much easier.
[00:36:08.072 --> 00:36:14.355]  This rewards people who broke the law with permanent legal status and puts them ahead of millions of law-abiding immigrants waiting to come to America.
[00:36:14.475 --> 00:36:16.976]  I don't care how you try to spin it, this is amnesty.
[00:36:17.715 --> 00:36:19.198]  Of course it's amnesty!
[00:36:19.238 --> 00:36:20.600]  An unlimited visa?
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.464]  If you can just get here illegally, you get a visa?
[00:36:24.525 --> 00:36:26.368]  This is the criminal pirate government.
[00:36:26.388 --> 00:36:33.739]  Look, the globalists want to bring this country down any way they can, and they're using Mexico as a pawn
[00:36:34.602 --> 00:36:46.557]  With anti-American, nationalistic fervor they've been pumped full of to bring the country down, to drive down the wages, to blow out the state's coffers, which are all going bankrupt because of the illegal aliens.
[00:36:46.577 --> 00:36:47.918]  That's the biggest contributing factor.
[00:36:49.821 --> 00:36:52.604]  You know, over half of California's budget is for the illegal aliens.
[00:36:54.449 --> 00:36:55.990]  And again, they get averaged into the country.
[00:36:56.010 --> 00:37:00.772]  It's even more than triple what they actually pay in taxes do they take out in California.
[00:37:01.153 --> 00:37:04.394]  California's averaged into the national average being right at triple.
[00:37:05.955 --> 00:37:08.437]  And then these people get up, we need somebody to pick the lettuce.
[00:37:09.177 --> 00:37:10.658]  Pick the lettuce, you idiots!
[00:37:11.178 --> 00:37:15.961]  They take triple the money in services that they put in!
[00:37:16.301 --> 00:37:17.341]  It's a cancer!
[00:37:18.322 --> 00:37:22.124]  And I'm not against these people individually in third world enslavement.
[00:37:22.724 --> 00:37:23.725]  I don't want to live in it.
[00:37:25.956 --> 00:37:30.717]  I don't blame them with 30 plus million living in the metro area of the city and the greater city.
[00:37:30.957 --> 00:37:32.517]  The city as it's called, Mexico City.
[00:37:32.857 --> 00:37:37.598]  I don't blame 6 billion, 200 plus million people wanting to come to the U.S.
[00:37:37.618 --> 00:37:38.698]  where there's 300 million.
[00:37:39.198 --> 00:37:40.839]  The whole world wants to come here.
[00:37:41.379 --> 00:37:54.081]  I heard a Canadian on Neil Bortz this morning, when Neil was actually being honest about how bad this was, and the Canadian said, I've been here 20 years, I'm married an American, because I've got a pension in Canada, I never took full citizenship, but I had to pay thousands of dollars to get it.
[00:37:55.603 --> 00:37:57.885]  He went on to talk about how he couldn't sleep last night.
[00:37:58.266 --> 00:37:59.187]  He was so upset.
[00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:05.052]  What was my point I was going to make though in connection with that?
[00:38:05.192 --> 00:38:07.755]  Oh, how he had to go through all this medical testing.
[00:38:08.692 --> 00:38:12.716]  And whenever you bring that up, they go, oh, that's the oldest thing in the book to put down immigrants and say they're diseased.
[00:38:13.076 --> 00:38:13.737]  They are!
[00:38:13.757 --> 00:38:17.680]  7,000 plus cases of leprosy in 2005.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.181]  The new numbers haven't come out.
[00:38:19.442 --> 00:38:20.302]  They come out every few years.
[00:38:20.523 --> 00:38:24.546]  When there was three cases in all the years before it, that's transmittable leprosy.
[00:38:24.846 --> 00:38:26.408]  Most of it in Texas, by the way.
[00:38:27.849 --> 00:38:29.711]  They've opened a leper colony in East Texas.
[00:38:31.007 --> 00:38:32.508]  Associated Press, Will Nant Daily.
[00:38:33.028 --> 00:38:37.171]  Drug immune, drug resistant, highly resistant TB.
[00:38:37.411 --> 00:38:39.533]  They're opening sanitariums where they lock you up.
[00:38:39.733 --> 00:38:42.735]  Headlines, people may be kept in sanitariums for life!
[00:38:43.235 --> 00:38:43.975]  For life!
[00:38:44.616 --> 00:38:48.038]  The drugs are so deadly they kill a lot of people that take them to try to get rid of it.
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:57.404]  The average person with TB in a classroom or business setting will spread it to at least 40 people.
[00:38:57.624 --> 00:38:58.685]  That's a CDC number.
[00:38:58.705 --> 00:39:00.286]  40 people a year.
[00:39:01.201 --> 00:39:03.102]  They don't test these illegals and their kids.
[00:39:03.323 --> 00:39:15.791]  They send them right in to make the hamburgers and make the enchiladas and we all eat them and they send them right in to the schools and they cough all over everybody in gym class and right there next to your child.
[00:39:16.091 --> 00:39:18.433]  I don't care if you're Hispanic, black or white or Asian.
[00:39:18.693 --> 00:39:19.834]  Does that concern you?
[00:39:21.355 --> 00:39:25.318]  By the way, the Russians have an even more deadly form of TB and again, they're white.
[00:39:26.064 --> 00:39:28.806]  And they're pouring in, but nothing like the Latin Americans.
[00:39:29.266 --> 00:39:33.909]  And when the TV spreads and the numbers explode, which it has, they keep it real quiet.
[00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:35.850]  Don't want to spook people.
[00:39:36.111 --> 00:39:37.552]  America's almost dead.
[00:39:37.812 --> 00:39:38.973]  So you've got the diseases.
[00:39:39.293 --> 00:39:41.434]  You've got the secrecy of the bill.
[00:39:41.654 --> 00:39:43.576]  You've got the fact that it's a total amnesty.
[00:39:43.816 --> 00:39:45.037]  Complete amnesty!
[00:39:46.017 --> 00:39:51.141]  Amnesty plus, in Orwellian terms, because it allows them to then chain migrate.
[00:39:51.621 --> 00:39:53.102]  Bring in their families.
[00:39:54.955 --> 00:39:58.336]  And then the Feds want to bankrupt the states, because then they're coming in and starting to federalize them.
[00:39:58.376 --> 00:40:00.497]  See, with just money, the bankers just print out of nothing.
[00:40:00.917 --> 00:40:02.197]  The country's going down.
[00:40:02.297 --> 00:40:03.418]  Worldwide mayday.
[00:40:03.798 --> 00:40:04.958]  I mean it when I say this.
[00:40:06.118 --> 00:40:06.479]  Mayday!
[00:40:06.539 --> 00:40:06.899]  Mayday!
[00:40:06.939 --> 00:40:07.339]  Mayday!
[00:40:07.599 --> 00:40:11.160]  The United States was seized by private intelligence agencies in 1913.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.881]  They expanded their power with the War Powers Act in 1933.
[00:40:15.228 --> 00:40:20.310]  They took full control of the 1947 National Security Act when the shadow government took full command.
[00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:25.592]  They have been absorbing what was left of the Republic and any free market systems ever since.
[00:40:25.912 --> 00:40:28.734]  Now in 2007 they are destroying.
[00:40:29.034 --> 00:40:31.415]  America is dying right now.
[00:40:31.695 --> 00:40:34.376]  America is almost unsalvageable now.
[00:40:35.362 --> 00:40:55.387]  If they pass this, and then there'll be huge revolts when they do, and if we can't block it, even if they do pass it, we're going to keep fighting then, there is no doubt, ladies and gentlemen, that the globalists then, within the next five years, will institute giant race riots, and then if you fight back, or try to defend yourself, the military's going to gun you down, let the illegals burn the cities to the ground.
[00:40:56.767 --> 00:40:59.488]  And then they'll bring in police state after that and start cracking down on them.
[00:41:00.828 --> 00:41:01.609]  How do I know this?
[00:41:01.789 --> 00:41:04.070]  Rex 84, 1986 declassified.
[00:41:04.271 --> 00:41:09.414]  They said they built FEMA camps all over America, claiming it was for illegal alien riots, when it was really for U.S.
[00:41:09.434 --> 00:41:13.517]  citizens and to set up martial law, that they would foment illegal alien riots to bring it in.
[00:41:13.758 --> 00:41:15.319]  I have the Senate hearings on video.
[00:41:15.499 --> 00:41:16.760]  That's how we know all this!
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.822]  What did the Houston Chronicle then report last year?
[00:41:20.062 --> 00:41:23.625]  They reported that they're building FEMA camps for millions of people,
[00:41:24.631 --> 00:41:27.394]  And the headline was, four illegal aliens and U.S.
[00:41:28.075 --> 00:41:30.617]  citizens, or anyone that revolts.
[00:41:30.997 --> 00:41:45.091]  Then Bush, last year, under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, took the power over the National and State Guards, which he couldn't do, by the way, but he did, from the governors, setting up the power for real martial law.
[00:41:45.452 --> 00:41:46.953]  They took the safety off, folks.
[00:41:47.354 --> 00:41:48.555]  Now they put the gun to our head.
[00:41:49.597 --> 00:41:54.301]  The Military Commissions Act allows the secret arrest, secret torture, secret execution of U.S.
[00:41:54.321 --> 00:41:57.183]  citizens by designating you a foreign enemy combatant.
[00:41:57.223 --> 00:41:57.763]  It's in there.
[00:41:58.104 --> 00:41:59.745]  All the top law professors saw it.
[00:42:00.245 --> 00:42:04.389]  You idiot illegal aliens, if you can understand me, need to listen to me.
[00:42:05.009 --> 00:42:09.533]  The globalists are playing three-dimensional chess and you can't even play checkers.
[00:42:11.434 --> 00:42:18.600]  As dumb as the illegal aliens are, though, on average they're more wise and streetwise than the moron yuppies of this country, the trash of Earth.
[00:42:20.279 --> 00:42:21.900]  And they're not going to call Congress today.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.361]  They're not going to call the Senate today.
[00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:25.922]  They're not going to call on Monday.
[00:42:25.962 --> 00:42:42.432]  They're going to go play golf, and they're going to go to a topless bar, and they're going to go hire a hooker this weekend, and they're going to go partying out on the boat, and they're going to get a new tattoo, and they're going to feel tough, and they're going to do all that while our country is completely going down!
[00:42:42.732 --> 00:42:43.292]  Mayday!
[00:42:43.532 --> 00:42:44.032]  Mayday!
[00:42:44.052 --> 00:42:44.593]  Mayday!
[00:42:44.613 --> 00:42:44.933]  Mayday!
[00:42:45.173 --> 00:42:45.673]  Mayday!
[00:42:47.245 --> 00:42:49.368]  Believe me, folks, you better fight and work hard now.
[00:42:49.548 --> 00:42:56.398]  Because if the enemy wins, there's going to be plenty of time for you to work in a slave factory or to be a blue-collar serf if you're lucky.
[00:42:57.299 --> 00:42:59.242]  And to have foreign cops shoving you around.
[00:42:59.282 --> 00:43:04.069]  And now, that brings me to the absolute most disgusting thing ever.
[00:43:05.917 --> 00:43:28.099]  Now before I cut, and then I'm going to give you numbers for the Senate, and we're going to get into Ron Paul, I haven't even gotten into all the new developments there, how it shut down the RNC, the GOPAC phone lines, the Republican Party of Michigan that kicked all this off, their phone lines, they've taken their contact info off their sites, we have talked to people that know their staffers and the staffers, they're saying that it's literally hundreds of calls a minute, good.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.481]  That went supernova.
[00:43:29.961 --> 00:43:39.369]  Now we need to make sure you go up to PrisonPlanet.com and get the contact numbers and info we're going to post in the next hour and that you get that little press release and that you get it out to everybody.
[00:43:39.649 --> 00:43:43.192]  And we're going to target Sean Hannity in the third hour today.
[00:43:43.252 --> 00:43:45.775]  He goes live in I think an hour and a half.
[00:43:47.716 --> 00:43:54.362]  And I want you for the full three hours of that guy's show to hit him as hard as you can.
[00:43:55.484 --> 00:44:03.047]  That means getting in, talking about how you love George Bush, and call the call screener, Ron Paul's a traitor, because they attacked the First Amendment.
[00:44:03.067 --> 00:44:04.968]  These are enemy officers of the New World Order.
[00:44:05.268 --> 00:44:13.211]  You've got to get through Flipper and the rest of them, and just get in, or act like a dumb liberal, and they'll put you on there, and just hit him hard, hit him hard, hit him hard.
[00:44:13.672 --> 00:44:19.194]  Or if you want, call the call screener, and just tell them, we know they're larcenous traitors, and we're aware of their activities.
[00:44:20.703 --> 00:44:23.284]  I mean, Sean Hannity said every child needs a chip in America.
[00:44:23.544 --> 00:44:24.985]  He said arrest all the militias.
[00:44:25.345 --> 00:44:28.887]  He's trying to peddle this amnesty thing, going, I don't like the borders.
[00:44:29.187 --> 00:44:30.547]  I've been down there three times.
[00:44:30.827 --> 00:44:31.848]  But we need something.
[00:44:34.129 --> 00:44:41.732]  Yeah, we need total, complete, Z visas, where if you get here illegally, you're totally legalized and never have to leave.
[00:44:42.461 --> 00:44:50.327]  And you can bring all your family over, and it lets unlimited skilled and unskilled workers be brought in by the Fortune 500, bused and flown in and boated in.
[00:44:50.627 --> 00:44:51.428]  That's in there, too.
[00:44:51.788 --> 00:44:53.890]  It's the Kennedy Bill, we're told, by the Senators that have seen it.
[00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.712]  But again, we can't see it, because it's so bad, it's secret.
[00:44:58.246 --> 00:44:59.426]  And Bush is twisting arms.
[00:44:59.466 --> 00:45:00.767]  The payoffs are being made.
[00:45:01.027 --> 00:45:02.468]  The photographs are being shown.
[00:45:02.488 --> 00:45:06.129]  The politicians with their hookers just came out.
[00:45:06.169 --> 00:45:09.650]  Our British Petroleum, you know, gets people in there with the hookers and videotapes it all.
[00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:11.191]  It's the same thing with our government.
[00:45:11.831 --> 00:45:14.732]  And, I mean, they're twisting arms.
[00:45:15.612 --> 00:45:19.833]  It's a full-tilt boogie because they're in a race to kill this country.
[00:45:20.374 --> 00:45:23.995]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, the big news.
[00:45:26.724 --> 00:45:28.084]  The big news!
[00:45:30.345 --> 00:45:37.487]  Now, before I read the rest of this story, Santa Fe Police Department looking into hiring Mexican nationals.
[00:45:38.208 --> 00:45:40.968]  This alone is a 50 alarm fire.
[00:45:41.388 --> 00:45:44.009]  This is rip your hair out, run down the street screaming.
[00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:49.511]  This, and folks, by the way, when they announce they're thinking about it, it's already been done as we've told you.
[00:45:51.091 --> 00:45:52.692]  Now, to prove that, let me read this.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:03.923]  Okay, I thought I... Oh, good, they did reprint the... I printed the Christian Science Monitor on this.
[00:46:04.003 --> 00:46:04.983]  I printed the counterpunch.
[00:46:05.743 --> 00:46:07.544]  Did the Boston Globe on this not print?
[00:46:07.864 --> 00:46:12.046]  Guys, print me the Boston Globe article on this from last year.
[00:46:12.066 --> 00:46:18.068]  Because the Boston Globe had the headline, oh, they may hire foreign nationals for the military.
[00:46:18.088 --> 00:46:18.628]  And then it said,
[00:46:19.858 --> 00:46:34.792]  Next line, they're talking about radically expanding an already existing program from Manila, Philippines to Mexico City, Mexico with foreign recruiting stations overseas to hire foreigners to make up the shrinking ranks of the military.
[00:46:35.733 --> 00:46:36.534]  That's a paraphrase.
[00:46:37.074 --> 00:46:38.856]  But see, the headline said, may do it.
[00:46:39.216 --> 00:46:42.820]  When they tell you they may do it, that means they're already doing it.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.141]  Here's Christian Science Monitor though.
[00:46:45.254 --> 00:46:45.434]  U.S.
[00:46:45.455 --> 00:46:56.010]  military may recruit foreigners to serve Pentagon considering several disputed proposals including fast-track citizenship for volunteers, struggling to fill its depleted ranks, the U.S.
[00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:56.791]  Army citizenry
[00:46:57.552 --> 00:46:58.233]  The U.S.
[00:46:58.273 --> 00:47:00.214]  military is considering recruiting more.
[00:47:00.434 --> 00:47:01.535]  See, more.
[00:47:01.996 --> 00:47:02.676]  More.
[00:47:03.117 --> 00:47:04.878]  See, the headline is they haven't started it yet.
[00:47:04.898 --> 00:47:06.379]  It's been going on for a decade.
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:09.182]  But they hire aggravated felon ones.
[00:47:09.222 --> 00:47:10.403]  That was in the Washington Times.
[00:47:10.823 --> 00:47:11.283]  That's right.
[00:47:11.344 --> 00:47:13.405]  Rapist and arsonist were listed.
[00:47:13.906 --> 00:47:14.766]  What did Stalin do?
[00:47:14.806 --> 00:47:15.747]  He emptied out the jails.
[00:47:16.848 --> 00:47:19.690]  But if you can get foreigners who are also criminal, oh, even better.
[00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:22.613]  I don't think that's ever been done before.
[00:47:24.065 --> 00:47:26.908]  Struggling to fill its completed ranks using American citizenry, the U.S.
[00:47:27.028 --> 00:47:29.270]  Army is considering recruiting more non-U.S.
[00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:30.852]  citizens, according to Pentagon officials.
[00:47:31.252 --> 00:47:40.321]  The Boston Globe reports that this will include disputed proposals like opening recruiting offices overseas and fast-tracking foreigners who join the military for U.S.
[00:47:40.341 --> 00:47:40.942]  citizenship.
[00:47:44.185 --> 00:47:45.947]  Because honestly, foreign citizens serving
[00:47:47.799 --> 00:47:49.180]  It's just a foreigner.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.021]  Everything CIA written.
[00:47:51.041 --> 00:47:52.122]  This article is total government.
[00:47:52.542 --> 00:47:56.204]  Foreign citizens serving in the U.S.
[00:47:56.224 --> 00:47:58.166]  military is a highly charged issue.
[00:47:58.206 --> 00:47:58.986]  It's high treason.
[00:48:00.527 --> 00:48:10.093]  And also, of course, what all the old-timers told you, all the old militia guys, all the colonels who were in special ops who quit and told you 30 years ago, I saw plans
[00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:12.852]  I remember seeing videotapes of guys in respirators.
[00:48:13.193 --> 00:48:15.375]  I've seen the plans bringing foreign troops.
[00:48:15.495 --> 00:48:16.256]  Take your guns.
[00:48:16.476 --> 00:48:17.718]  I'm telling you, warn the people.
[00:48:18.058 --> 00:48:19.840]  Oh, that old guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:48:20.081 --> 00:48:23.525]  They've been planning this so long, and now they're setting it up.
[00:48:23.845 --> 00:48:26.008]  And you just go, I know, go party this weekend.
[00:48:26.248 --> 00:48:27.549]  Go suck your thumbs.
[00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:28.731]  Do what you like.
[00:48:31.525 --> 00:48:33.966]  We need the maximum output in resisting this.
[00:48:34.306 --> 00:48:35.426]  Foreign citizens serving U.S.
[00:48:35.446 --> 00:48:39.027]  military is a highly charged issue which could expose the Pentagon to criticism.
[00:48:39.047 --> 00:48:39.527]  Okay, it goes on.
[00:48:40.047 --> 00:48:45.128]  And it says to charges that it's essentially using mercenaries to defend their country.
[00:48:45.168 --> 00:48:45.949]  To defend their country?
[00:48:46.169 --> 00:48:47.249]  Our country's been hijacked.
[00:48:47.449 --> 00:48:49.709]  This is demonizing America worldwide.
[00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:50.870]  We're losing our good name.
[00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:55.491]  We're being used for foreign oil companies in Israel and others to go dominate and take over the planet.
[00:48:56.091 --> 00:48:57.353]  See, that's another deceptive term.
[00:48:57.593 --> 00:48:59.635]  Oh, we're going to use foreigners to defend America.
[00:48:59.835 --> 00:49:01.176]  Well, I guess it's okay.
[00:49:01.717 --> 00:49:02.998]  Folks, there is no America!
[00:49:03.018 --> 00:49:05.100]  We've been in the North American Union for two years!
[00:49:05.501 --> 00:49:10.666]  I'm trying to get you woke up so we can put shock paddles and defibrillate the country and get it back!
[00:49:11.927 --> 00:49:13.509]  That's why I've been freaking out!
[00:49:18.337 --> 00:49:27.347]  And I loved it when David Dees, the illustrator, went and took that term I coined about defibrillating Uncle Sam and shows Uncle Sam with bullet holes in him on an operating table and they're defibrillating him.
[00:49:28.488 --> 00:49:30.470]  Deesillustration.com, I think is the website.
[00:49:30.491 --> 00:49:31.692]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:49:32.418 --> 00:49:34.239]  By the way, this is already being done quietly.
[00:49:34.679 --> 00:49:39.222]  There are seven South Texas towns where no English is allowed in court proceedings.
[00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:40.783]  It's been in the San Antonio Express News.
[00:49:41.343 --> 00:49:47.226]  And where Mexican police, they're, quote, in America, but they fly Mexican flags over the courthouses.
[00:49:47.747 --> 00:49:49.047]  You think I'm joking, don't you?
[00:49:49.648 --> 00:49:50.448]  See, you just don't know.
[00:49:51.228 --> 00:49:53.310]  And Gringo better not come around.
[00:49:54.951 --> 00:49:59.373]  Here it is, Santa Fe Police Department looking into hiring Mexican nationals.
[00:49:59.993 --> 00:50:01.134]  La Cruz's son.
[00:50:03.578 --> 00:50:28.217]  Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press, Associated Press,
[00:50:31.008 --> 00:50:36.472]  And there were Mexican troops on the street corners, and I was swinging the door open, and I was a man.
[00:50:37.073 --> 00:50:39.615]  Now, and that might have been, I mean, just some foreshadowing.
[00:50:39.695 --> 00:50:40.596]  Who knows what it was?
[00:50:42.397 --> 00:50:43.758]  And, well, let's just say it wasn't pretty.
[00:50:44.319 --> 00:50:49.523]  And I would have that dream over and over again, and it was like a few other dreams I've had in my past that did come true.
[00:50:50.163 --> 00:50:52.205]  Now, I'm hoping that dream doesn't come true, folks.
[00:50:53.546 --> 00:50:55.387]  But I have envisioned this.
[00:50:55.627 --> 00:50:56.268]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:04.739 --> 00:51:10.188]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.568 --> 00:51:18.200]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:25.943]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.343 --> 00:51:37.768]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.068 --> 00:51:41.990]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:43.971]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.311 --> 00:51:48.153]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:46.057 --> 00:54:47.377]  Be careful what you wish for.
[00:54:47.397 --> 00:54:48.857]  Looks like you're gonna get it.
[00:54:49.558 --> 00:54:50.358]  Nowhere to run.
[00:54:51.638 --> 00:54:52.118]  Crank it up.
[00:54:53.218 --> 00:54:55.439]  See, my proceeds don't prove the world.
[00:54:55.619 --> 00:54:58.120]  You better get that in your head.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:00.720]  This world is ruled by violence.
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:03.841]  But I guess I'd better let my friends.
[00:55:21.207 --> 00:55:22.708]  This is Associated Press.
[00:55:23.008 --> 00:55:24.850]  Yeah, a man's gonna do what a man's gotta do.
[00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:28.712]  Now, look, I've only had a few of those, uh, dreams.
[00:55:29.573 --> 00:55:35.437]  One time I had a dream about a mugging, and with a guy wearing a particular, uh, pink and green striped shirt.
[00:55:35.917 --> 00:55:39.259]  The very person then, a few months later, popped out of a corner and assaulted me.
[00:55:39.599 --> 00:55:42.141]  And I was so stunned that it was happening, it was, it was bizarre.
[00:55:42.922 --> 00:55:44.483]  I've had a few other cases like that.
[00:55:44.503 --> 00:55:50.907]  You know, like I knew the day my grandmother died, I said, we gotta go see her, and then the phone rang and she was dead, and it just happened unexpectedly.
[00:55:51.687 --> 00:55:53.028]  You know, things like that happen to everybody.
[00:55:53.429 --> 00:55:58.774]  But I used to have this dream where there were Mexican troops running a checkpoint with our own police in America.
[00:55:59.795 --> 00:56:01.176]  And see, they break the ice.
[00:56:01.656 --> 00:56:02.878]  And that dream used to... I used to have it a lot.
[00:56:02.938 --> 00:56:03.758]  It really freaked me out.
[00:56:03.859 --> 00:56:07.382]  And then, one time I was driving through a town and I said, I've been here.
[00:56:07.442 --> 00:56:09.844]  This is a... And family indeed did move there.
[00:56:10.125 --> 00:56:14.649]  In the dream, I was trying to get to family and... But again, this isn't dreams, folks.
[00:56:14.669 --> 00:56:15.770]  This is the real world.
[00:56:17.134 --> 00:56:20.275]  Over 20% of the ground force in Iraq is Latin Americans.
[00:56:20.315 --> 00:56:21.596]  They've hired the old death squads.
[00:56:21.616 --> 00:56:24.817]  A lot of them are Mexicans, but a lot of them are from Nicaragua and El Salvador.
[00:56:25.517 --> 00:56:27.778]  Son of Castillo, I told you about that on air.
[00:56:28.618 --> 00:56:30.819]  About a year and a half before it finally broke in the mainstream news.
[00:56:31.939 --> 00:56:33.620]  So, the point is, this is already going on.
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:35.320]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:36.781]  Of course, it's how good it is.
[00:56:36.801 --> 00:56:38.782]  The article's saying how wonderful it is.
[00:56:39.502 --> 00:56:42.843]  Santa Fe Police Department looking into hiring Mexican nationals.
[00:56:43.624 --> 00:56:50.028]  The Santa Fe Police Department is considering the possibility of recruiting Mexican nationals to fill vacant police jobs.
[00:56:50.908 --> 00:57:05.937]  Sergeant Gillian Aliseo and Marvin Polk, who are in charge of the department's recruiting and training, said Tuesday they are considering alternative approaches to fill 20 vacancies on the city's 155-person police force.
[00:57:06.398 --> 00:57:06.998]  There you go!
[00:57:07.018 --> 00:57:10.520]  Let me just give everybody a news flash.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.242]  Mexican police are unbelievably corrupt.
[00:57:15.307 --> 00:57:16.708]  And that's just the culture, I guess.
[00:57:17.108 --> 00:57:24.212]  But Police Chief Eric Johnson said the New Mexico Law Enforcement Academy regulations prohibit non-citizens from serving as police officers.
[00:57:24.712 --> 00:57:26.553]  When did that ever stop our criminal government?
[00:57:26.593 --> 00:57:28.274]  Hell, go down to El Cenizo in Texas.
[00:57:29.855 --> 00:57:35.878]  At least so, said the Santa Fe Police Force, like others around the country, is vying to recruit the same 21- to 30-year-olds as the U.S.
[00:57:35.918 --> 00:57:36.318]  military.
[00:57:36.598 --> 00:57:37.939]  Well, yeah, you just get them when they get out.
[00:57:37.979 --> 00:57:41.541]  Don't worry, they'll be killer-trained how to suppress populations when they get back.
[00:57:43.115 --> 00:57:45.596]  Whose need for recruits is taking a toll on the police department.
[00:57:45.657 --> 00:57:47.818]  Every day we get approached by young men.
[00:57:47.878 --> 00:57:52.540]  Yeah, young drug dealers who are probably just having shootouts with Border Patrol the night before.
[00:57:53.621 --> 00:57:56.543]  Every day we get approached by young men and women from Mexico!
[00:57:56.963 --> 00:57:57.944]  From Mexico!
[00:57:59.064 --> 00:58:03.827]  Who are in the country legally, but are not naturalized.
[00:58:04.548 --> 00:58:07.190]  And see, in Mexico, it's big status to be a cop.
[00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:09.192]  Because, yeah, you get to start taking the take.
[00:58:09.472 --> 00:58:10.833]  You get to live in the million-dollar house.
[00:58:10.873 --> 00:58:12.054]  You get to feed on everybody.
[00:58:12.675 --> 00:58:15.057]  I mean, boy, the best families get that.
[00:58:15.477 --> 00:58:21.302]  It's coveted to get to be a big, fat parasite, sucking off people like a dirty redcoat.
[00:58:22.228 --> 00:58:23.169]  That's what we threw off in 1776.
[00:58:23.609 --> 00:58:34.979]  And yeah, our cops may be a bunch of dirty dirtbags and corrupt as hell today, but they're a lot better than the Mexican police, and I am absolutely disgusted by this!
[00:58:35.359 --> 00:58:39.262]  I'll take our dirtbags over your dirtbags any day!
[00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:46.789]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:58.055 --> 00:58:58.676]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.356 --> 00:59:00.417]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.117 --> 00:59:02.238]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.878 --> 00:59:03.699]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.459 --> 00:59:05.380]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.643]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.203 --> 00:59:14.326]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.728 --> 00:59:23.352]  In the third hour, we'll get into how the New York Times tried to debunk 9-11 truth, attack my shelf, Rosie O'Donnell,
[00:59:24.156 --> 00:59:25.317]  Loose change crew, everybody.
[00:59:25.337 --> 00:59:30.340]  We got the loose change crew coming on in the third hour, talking about big 9-11 developments and the final cut.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:33.641]  We're going to have open phones in this hour, into the next hour.
[00:59:34.002 --> 00:59:35.462]  They'll be on this about the last 40 minutes.
[00:59:35.823 --> 00:59:37.664]  William Rodriguez is going to pop in as well.
[00:59:38.064 --> 00:59:42.126]  For those who just joined us, Santa Fe Police Department looking into hiring Mexican nationals.
[00:59:42.566 --> 00:59:44.988]  They say the military's hiring foreigners, why shouldn't we?
[00:59:45.548 --> 00:59:46.128]  Absolutely!
[00:59:46.228 --> 00:59:51.251]  Once the treason's committed by the scumbag Pentagon, bought and paid for by foreign banks, openly admitting it,
[00:59:51.952 --> 00:59:56.034]  Carrying out terror attacks on 9-11, why not have Mexican police?
[00:59:56.314 --> 00:59:57.834]  And folks, this is how it's already working.
[00:59:58.275 --> 01:00:09.519]  The El Jefe, Mordido, kickback, beak-dipping is now here, and it's just cesspool corruption everywhere.
[01:00:10.199 --> 01:00:13.961]  Believe me, I live in the Southwest, and we're sinking into total murk right now, folks.
[01:00:15.046 --> 01:00:24.971]  And they got a complete absolute amnesty bill they're keeping secret but excerpts of leaked senators are saying and has a Z visa for total legalization of anyone that's here.
[01:00:25.011 --> 01:00:28.192]  They can bring in 11 members of their family or more.
[01:00:28.532 --> 01:00:29.312]  That's the minimum.
[01:00:30.413 --> 01:00:32.514]  It'll draw in unlimited amounts of other fires.
[01:00:32.554 --> 01:00:39.217]  We've got huge Ron Paul developments and coming up after I take this first gamut of calls, this first round, I'm going to give you the number
[01:00:41.411 --> 01:01:05.129]  to the Senate to tell them, to tell those traitors, and to tell the House, who they're saying they're in conference now, they're saying the House is going to pass it next week, to tell those traitors, and to tell those scumbags, that they, tell them I know you're here to pacify me, don't give me your bull about how it is an amnesty, just know this, you're involved in high treason, and we're going to move to have you all arrested.
[01:01:05.729 --> 01:01:07.691]  They need to get hardcore calls.
[01:01:08.632 --> 01:01:08.952]  Okay?
[01:01:10.177 --> 01:01:11.097]  Just criminals.
[01:01:11.938 --> 01:01:13.318]  They've got to take us down quick, see?
[01:01:13.659 --> 01:01:15.239]  They're really moving to do it right now.
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.401]  So we'll recap the amnesty stuff.
[01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:19.601]  We'll get into the Ron Pauls.
[01:01:19.661 --> 01:01:20.381]  Huge developments there.
[01:01:20.401 --> 01:01:21.022]  You'll get phone numbers.
[01:01:21.422 --> 01:01:23.943]  In the third hour, I want you to call into Sean Hannity's show.
[01:01:24.523 --> 01:01:26.524]  Get through their call screeners or whatever you have to.
[01:01:26.544 --> 01:01:30.025]  And I want you to, and then after you're done with your call, they don't let you through.
[01:01:30.045 --> 01:01:31.626]  Just let them know that they're scumbag traitors.
[01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:35.808]  You know, let them know that we're fully aware they're working for black ops.
[01:01:35.868 --> 01:01:37.569]  He's out there peddling this amnesty deal.
[01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:38.469]  He may try to spin it.
[01:01:39.082 --> 01:01:41.844]  Just to let them know we're fully aware of their activities against Ron Paul.
[01:01:43.385 --> 01:01:45.386]  John in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:01:47.328 --> 01:01:48.528]  Yeah, good morning Alex.
[01:01:48.869 --> 01:01:49.629]  Hi, what's on your mind?
[01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:52.371]  I have a question for you.
[01:01:52.671 --> 01:02:02.718]  I don't know if you heard about the zombie outbreak in South America, Cambodia.
[01:02:02.758 --> 01:02:04.379]  Are you smoking dope right now?
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:08.742]  No, I saw an actual BBC news article on the net.
[01:02:09.286 --> 01:02:19.678]  And he even saw a video of a... It was a helicopter, uh, showing the forest at night, and, uh, some man running with a gun, and he gets attacked by these five people that just, like, rip him apart.
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:25.301]  I know you're talking about a lot of biological agents and viruses and stuff.
[01:02:26.081 --> 01:02:31.163]  I know in the Caribbean and places they've had poisons that make you basically die.
[01:02:31.923 --> 01:02:34.744]  Your heart beats so slow people can't pick it up and they bury you.
[01:02:35.624 --> 01:02:37.044]  That's just basic MK Ultra.
[01:02:37.084 --> 01:02:38.625]  See that's an example of
[01:02:39.665 --> 01:02:40.966]  It's a zombie outbreak in Cambodia.
[01:02:40.986 --> 01:02:41.467]  Quansal, quarantined.
[01:03:08.439 --> 01:03:10.220]  Okay, I'll check it out.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.502]  Sounds like a prank, but we'll check it out there, sir.
[01:03:13.562 --> 01:03:13.902]  Thank you.
[01:03:15.263 --> 01:03:16.943]  Let's go ahead and talk to Richard in Texas.
[01:03:17.003 --> 01:03:17.684]  Richard, go ahead.
[01:03:18.024 --> 01:03:18.444]  You know what?
[01:03:18.464 --> 01:03:19.024]  I don't have time.
[01:03:19.044 --> 01:03:20.045]  We'll go to Richard after.
[01:03:20.065 --> 01:03:22.206]  And listen, I'm going to move to your calls quickly.
[01:03:24.207 --> 01:03:26.008]  I'm going to move to your calls quickly.
[01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.869]  Alright?
[01:03:28.906 --> 01:03:31.548]  I'm going to try.
[01:03:31.568 --> 01:03:31.848]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:32.209 --> 01:03:33.530]  Have your questions and comments ready.
[01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:38.033]  We've covered how foreign Mexican police will rule us, foreign Mexican military will rule us.
[01:03:38.653 --> 01:03:41.255]  That's just a small portion of the enslavement.
[01:03:41.876 --> 01:03:43.237]  And total, complete amnesty.
[01:03:43.317 --> 01:03:44.077]  Absolute, complete.
[01:03:44.117 --> 01:03:44.978]  Directly from the Senate.
[01:03:45.719 --> 01:03:48.080]  And they're trying to ban Ron Paul from the debates right now.
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.041]  They're not playing games.
[01:03:49.802 --> 01:03:52.564]  And they're almost... It's just... It's horrible.
[01:03:56.872 --> 01:03:57.313]  It's here!
[01:03:57.553 --> 01:04:02.318]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.679 --> 01:04:10.327]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:18.076]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.456 --> 01:04:29.921]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.201 --> 01:04:33.723]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.163 --> 01:04:36.084]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.424 --> 01:04:40.286]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:55.382 --> 01:04:59.886]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:05:00.226 --> 01:05:04.329]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:05.170]  We listened.
[01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:10.455]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:10.735 --> 01:05:11.215]  We listened.
[01:05:11.595 --> 01:05:14.638]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:15.058 --> 01:05:15.599]  We listened.
[01:05:16.059 --> 01:05:19.462]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:20.002]  We're good to go.
[01:05:36.491 --> 01:05:39.112]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[01:05:39.312 --> 01:05:39.512]  Only $279.

[01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:59.515]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:01.356 --> 01:07:11.764]  The mainstream media is announcing that they're going to increase the number of foreign nationals as troops in our military and of course for domestic operations, that goes.
[01:07:12.444 --> 01:07:21.851]  The Associated Press is reporting that police departments want to have Mexican nationals as police over the American people and the dumb idiot population will probably love it.
[01:07:23.391 --> 01:07:25.973]  I mean, this is just classical takeover behavior.
[01:07:27.454 --> 01:07:30.056]  They have a complete amnesty plus.
[01:07:30.116 --> 01:07:30.997]  It isn't just amnesty.
[01:07:31.017 --> 01:07:35.881]  They can then bring in 11 other family members in the next four years, and they can bring in more after that.
[01:07:36.896 --> 01:07:38.637]  It is an unlimited Z Visa.
[01:07:38.657 --> 01:07:40.618]  This is what we've gotten out of the secret bill.
[01:07:41.018 --> 01:07:42.139]  It's secret on top of it.
[01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:43.859]  We're into all the Ron Paul developments.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:49.442]  I'm going to give you numbers at the Santa Fe Trader Police Department to let them understand that that's treason.
[01:07:50.022 --> 01:08:02.768]  That we know they're running an El Jefe operation out of there and they want to get the Mordido going and the kickbacks going there in their town and really get everybody firmly underfoot with some folks that know how to knock heads and are used to pushing folks around down in Mexico.
[01:08:03.408 --> 01:08:04.609]  That we're not going to put up with that.
[01:08:04.629 --> 01:08:11.132]  We're going to give out the number again to the RNC, whose phones have been shut down since yesterday when we gave their phone numbers out.
[01:08:12.073 --> 01:08:14.174]  And that's now turned into a national phenomenon.
[01:08:14.194 --> 01:08:16.795]  I want to commend all of you that when we started that, you took action.
[01:08:18.336 --> 01:08:19.777]  I mean, it just completely shut them down.
[01:08:19.797 --> 01:08:23.218]  By the way, I called twice yesterday and then twice last night, and the phones were busy.
[01:08:24.099 --> 01:08:25.119]  So keep hammering them.
[01:08:25.459 --> 01:08:29.662]  But most importantly, those are side caveats.
[01:08:29.782 --> 01:08:32.203]  And we're going to give you the latest Ron Paul info and a lot more.
[01:08:33.206 --> 01:08:36.709]  I'm going to go through the amnesty plan and the numbers of the U.S.
[01:08:36.729 --> 01:08:37.069]  Senate.
[01:08:37.489 --> 01:08:38.950]  Get ready for that in a few minutes.
[01:08:39.691 --> 01:08:44.854]  And then on top of it, in the third hour, I want to go after Sean Hannity.
[01:08:45.295 --> 01:08:52.040]  I want some of you, just pick, to call in and weevil through their call screeners and get on air.
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:56.703]  And I want others of you just to call in and let them know that you're fully aware of their traitorous activities.
[01:08:58.084 --> 01:08:59.785]  And his show starts in about an hour.
[01:08:59.805 --> 01:09:00.966]  It doesn't enter 45 minutes.
[01:09:01.327 --> 01:09:03.548]  So we'll give it out right before then so you can go ahead and load them up.
[01:09:06.431 --> 01:09:07.572]  And don't let it stop, too.
[01:09:07.652 --> 01:09:08.452]  Call in next week.
[01:09:08.472 --> 01:09:11.375]  I mean, we gotta get aggressive with these people.
[01:09:12.776 --> 01:09:14.057]  Let's blast through your calls.
[01:09:14.157 --> 01:09:14.978]  Steve in Ohio.
[01:09:14.998 --> 01:09:15.358]  Go ahead.
[01:09:19.483 --> 01:09:20.824]  Stephen Chicago, go ahead.
[01:09:21.104 --> 01:09:21.644]  Oh, yes sir.
[01:09:22.545 --> 01:09:36.631]  Alex, I just wanted to cheer you a little bit because I know that the tenor of the conversation, the Spiegel Magazine has a nice article about the fall of the hardest neocon, meaning your buddy Wolfowitz.
[01:09:37.072 --> 01:09:40.953]  They said that Germany, France, and the Netherlands ganged up against him.
[01:09:40.973 --> 01:09:42.354]  No, no, no, he's just a puppet.
[01:09:42.374 --> 01:09:43.975]  That's internal globalist fighting.
[01:09:44.773 --> 01:09:50.778]  I mean, he's just a puppet, but I mean, sure, it's good to see him falling, but see, they'll get rid of Bush, and they'll just put Hillary in.
[01:09:51.038 --> 01:09:53.500]  See, we can't get too focused on their top puppets.
[01:09:53.781 --> 01:09:55.482]  We gotta get focused and attack the system.
[01:09:56.403 --> 01:10:01.567]  The problem is, is I don't know if the Americans are strong enough and have the willpower to take action.
[01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:04.650]  It seems like we have to have foreign intervention because
[01:10:05.274 --> 01:10:09.097]  They're just standing around like stupid dull cattle, chewing their cuts.
[01:10:09.237 --> 01:10:10.338]  I don't see any action.
[01:10:10.538 --> 01:10:12.700]  Well, I do see action and I appreciate your call.
[01:10:13.181 --> 01:10:22.368]  I mean, I understand that you've got half the population that literally doesn't know their state capital, doesn't know up from down, doesn't know their hind end from a hole in the ground, knows nothing.
[01:10:23.048 --> 01:10:24.069]  They don't count, folks.
[01:10:24.129 --> 01:10:28.293]  It was 5% started the war, and it was more like 15% won the war.
[01:10:28.873 --> 01:10:29.273]  Started with 1%.
[01:10:30.436 --> 01:10:30.956]  In 1776.
[01:10:31.356 --> 01:10:47.142]  So, instead of always, and I do this too, I'm not mad at you, Steve in Chicago, and I appreciate what you're saying, but instead of focusing on all the cattle, let's talk about how we shut down the RNC and shut down GOPAC and shut down the Michigan Republican Party.
[01:10:48.302 --> 01:10:51.263]  Let's talk about how they took down their main numbers and we found their backup numbers.
[01:10:51.483 --> 01:10:52.804]  Let's talk about how they're panicking.
[01:10:53.815 --> 01:10:57.477]  Let's talk about how they were going to try to get Ron Paul out of the debates, and we forced him in there.
[01:10:57.697 --> 01:10:59.037]  And now we're going to try to keep him in there.
[01:10:59.458 --> 01:11:05.840]  And if they do remove him, it'll show the world how they're a bunch of cheats who can't win on a level playing field.
[01:11:06.181 --> 01:11:07.221]  So mad I can hardly talk.
[01:11:08.622 --> 01:11:10.222]  And they're going to try to go for amnesty.
[01:11:10.242 --> 01:11:11.863]  They're going to try to bring in foreign troops.
[01:11:11.983 --> 01:11:13.624]  That's what's going to wake the people up.
[01:11:13.664 --> 01:11:18.366]  So, instead of worrying about all the losers, let's call Congress and tell them no amnesty.
[01:11:18.466 --> 01:11:20.207]  Call the House and the Senate, but mainly the Senate.
[01:11:20.607 --> 01:11:20.967]  Right now.
[01:11:21.668 --> 01:11:22.508]  Next week it'll be the House.
[01:11:23.231 --> 01:11:23.731]  This is it.
[01:11:23.791 --> 01:11:24.432]  This is the fight.
[01:11:25.032 --> 01:11:29.454]  Let's call Sean Hannity and let him know that we understand he's a Judas goat and a fake conservative.
[01:11:30.454 --> 01:11:31.315]  We're going to go over that.
[01:11:32.035 --> 01:11:35.077]  Let's call the Santa Fe Police Department and let them know that they're criminals.
[01:11:35.437 --> 01:11:38.898]  And let them know that we know they want foreigners to oppress the American people.
[01:11:41.059 --> 01:11:42.940]  Let's go to Mark in New Jersey.
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:43.941]  Quickly, Mark, go ahead.
[01:11:44.681 --> 01:11:45.402]  Yes, hi Alex.
[01:11:45.662 --> 01:11:46.082]  Hi.
[01:11:46.562 --> 01:11:52.205]  This immigration thing, I understand that it's a huge problem and everyone's concerned about it.
[01:11:53.397 --> 01:12:04.344]  And I'm just curious as to your take on political solutions that go beyond just letting them know how we feel about the situation.
[01:12:04.444 --> 01:12:11.728]  Obviously, it begins by calling these numbers and letting these people know how we feel.
[01:12:12.949 --> 01:12:17.992]  But as far as a political situation to the problem that goes beyond that, what's your take?
[01:12:19.032 --> 01:12:19.973]  I appreciate your call.
[01:12:20.013 --> 01:12:20.994]  It's an excellent question.
[01:12:21.034 --> 01:12:21.714]  Let me answer it.
[01:12:22.717 --> 01:12:24.478]  Let me answer that question, Mark, from New Jersey.
[01:12:26.198 --> 01:12:50.908]  You call up your scumbag politicians, you call up Michael McCall, the Republican trash here in Austin, right outside Austin, you call up the Democratic filth, and you tell Lloyd Doggett, this is an example locally, we're going to come to every one of your public events and we're going to heckle you as a traitor, and we're going to do it everywhere you go.
[01:12:51.188 --> 01:12:52.028]  And then you do it.
[01:12:52.623 --> 01:12:54.166]  By the way, I've done this many times.
[01:12:54.847 --> 01:12:56.429]  I'm not telling you to do something I haven't done.
[01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:58.812]  And by the way, most people will agree with you when you go to these.
[01:13:00.815 --> 01:13:02.218]  And you go, okay, fine.
[01:13:02.238 --> 01:13:03.399]  You go ahead and vote for Amnesty.
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:04.902]  When is the next
[01:13:06.232 --> 01:13:11.236]  They'll go to a grocery store, they'll go to a library, they'll go to a Kiwanis Club, they'll go to a Rotary Club.
[01:13:11.937 --> 01:13:13.118]  Where is the next place?
[01:13:13.238 --> 01:13:15.780]  What is their next, you know, meet with the constituents?
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:28.250]  And then you go to the next one, and you go to the next one, and you take out three Wednesday afternoons, or Tuesday mornings, or Sunday afternoons, and you go down there, and you march in there, and you get ahold of their hand, and you say, listen to me.
[01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:38.656]  You know you're selling out foreign interest, and you know it's amnesty, and I'm gonna vote against you, you little traitor, and everybody here who's against this traitor needs to join me to get with his opposition.
[01:13:41.938 --> 01:13:44.419]  Let me tell you, they don't like you physically confronting them.
[01:13:44.659 --> 01:13:46.821]  That, at a very primitive level, gets to these people.
[01:13:48.602 --> 01:13:53.064]  I mean, you physically get in their face, and you call them a worm.
[01:13:53.685 --> 01:13:55.686]  You call them a scumbag, if you need to.
[01:13:56.266 --> 01:13:57.827]  I mean, it's time to get aggressive.
[01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:01.721]  In fact, ladies and gentlemen, I like what people have been doing to the pro-war crowd.
[01:14:01.741 --> 01:14:04.742]  They go to their homes and bullhorn them out front their houses.
[01:14:05.302 --> 01:14:08.243]  It's time to get aggressive with these people.
[01:14:10.503 --> 01:14:11.984]  It's time to get serious.
[01:14:12.524 --> 01:14:13.684]  Now, you talk about political.
[01:14:14.125 --> 01:14:17.966]  Politically, Ron Paul will shut down the borders and build a fence because that's constitutional.
[01:14:19.946 --> 01:14:25.728]  And so you get Ron Paul elected, you at least get him in the rest of the debates where he can educate the people and inject some sanity.
[01:14:28.792 --> 01:14:31.493]  And at the local level, let's say you're in Santa Fe.
[01:14:31.613 --> 01:14:33.314]  I mean, talk about a group of criminals.
[01:14:34.075 --> 01:14:44.059]  You start going to the city council meetings, or you live outside Santa Fe, and you go, how dare you talk about using Mexican citizens to come over here and, I mean, that's total tyranny.
[01:14:44.459 --> 01:14:45.480]  That's total oppression.
[01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:49.864]  And how dare you say that you can't hire the young people you need?
[01:14:50.104 --> 01:14:54.146]  Yeah, the department needs young, dumb, 18 to 25 year olds.
[01:14:54.606 --> 01:14:56.247]  Why don't you hire an old black woman?
[01:14:56.267 --> 01:14:58.588]  Why don't you hire some 50 year old white man?
[01:14:58.868 --> 01:15:04.670]  Why don't you hire some... because they aren't dumb and won't sit there and brutalize people like the young punks you're looking for.
[01:15:05.410 --> 01:15:11.553]  But you can't find enough young idiots because they're all off getting filled full of deadly injections and breathing D.U.
[01:15:13.087 --> 01:15:16.050]  And so you want to hire a bunch of foreigners to come in here and oppress us.
[01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:17.852]  You've got recruits you need.
[01:15:18.332 --> 01:15:21.535]  Use political correctness against them and say, why won't you hire U.S.
[01:15:21.575 --> 01:15:22.877]  citizens, you scum?
[01:15:23.617 --> 01:15:27.121]  You need to call for the firing of these recruiting officers that did this.
[01:15:27.161 --> 01:15:31.125]  By the way, we called for the firing of those teachers that told the kids they were going to die.
[01:15:31.145 --> 01:15:31.925]  They're now firing them.
[01:15:32.326 --> 01:15:36.069]  We called for the firing of Silverstein's goons, calling them fake bomb threats.
[01:15:36.230 --> 01:15:37.511]  We've now confirmed he was fired.
[01:15:38.311 --> 01:15:42.472]  I told you we need to go after the city here, trying to shut down free speech with AXS TV.
[01:15:42.692 --> 01:15:43.853]  The director went to prison.
[01:15:44.233 --> 01:15:47.214]  When we get up here and say something's criminal, it's because it's criminal!
[01:15:47.574 --> 01:15:48.174]  On it's face!
[01:15:48.354 --> 01:15:53.376]  And just because you're wearing monkey suit police uniforms, doesn't mean you don't need to go to jail!
[01:15:54.136 --> 01:16:00.258]  Now, if you hire foreigners, even though the state's telling you you can't do it, which it sounds like we're gonna go ahead and do, you need to be arrested.
[01:16:00.438 --> 01:16:02.759]  But right now, you just need to be fired!
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:06.140]  You understand, traitors?
[01:16:07.346 --> 01:16:10.287]  Can you understand what happens to traitors scum?
[01:16:11.747 --> 01:16:15.348]  I mean, if this doesn't get you just absolutely angry, I don't know what's wrong with you.
[01:16:17.749 --> 01:16:18.629]  Who's up next here?
[01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:24.431]  Joe in Cleveland, Ohio, also being overrun by illegal aliens.
[01:16:24.791 --> 01:16:25.572]  Go ahead, Joe.
[01:16:25.952 --> 01:16:26.212]  Alex.
[01:16:27.132 --> 01:16:27.412]  Yes?
[01:16:27.432 --> 01:16:33.014]  I got some important consumer tips on how to avoid plastics with dioxins.
[01:16:34.654 --> 01:16:37.135]  Yeah, that's what's feminizing and causing massive cancer.
[01:16:37.155 --> 01:16:43.437]  It's what's causing women to have too much estrogen and get breast cancer, and it's causing men to be a bunch of little twits.
[01:16:43.857 --> 01:16:44.097]  Right.
[01:16:45.418 --> 01:16:52.340]  So, when you go into a store, you go into the grocery store, there'll be a plastic, something's in a plastic container.
[01:16:53.401 --> 01:16:59.403]  Look at the bottom of the container, and there will be a triangular recycling logo with the arrows.
[01:17:00.123 --> 01:17:03.244]  Now, in the middle of that triangle, there will be a number.
[01:17:03.857 --> 01:17:07.300]  That number classifies what type of plastic it is.
[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:10.623]  And how much leakage it's allowed to have, you know.
[01:17:10.663 --> 01:17:13.425]  How much dioxin it's allowed to nutrition you with.
[01:17:14.006 --> 01:17:17.709]  Well, from my understanding, the one you should avoid is 3.
[01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:21.392]  Avoid the number 3 in the middle of that triangle.
[01:17:21.412 --> 01:17:25.055]  But why should families research the safer types of plastics?
[01:17:25.096 --> 01:17:26.617]  Why should they care about their children?
[01:17:27.293 --> 01:17:30.715]  Hell, they don't care about illegal aliens that are going to literally rule over them.
[01:17:30.955 --> 01:17:33.196]  I'm not joking, I've read the government documents.
[01:17:33.476 --> 01:17:38.939]  They say they're going to use Mexican troops and police to quote, deal with American terrorists.
[01:17:40.439 --> 01:17:45.402]  Because folks, a pack of Mexican troops will storm your house and gun your family down.
[01:17:47.003 --> 01:17:47.463]  I'm sorry.
[01:17:47.943 --> 01:17:53.706]  Well, I'm getting ready to call up Hannity, and I wanted to ask you, do you know how old Hannity is?
[01:17:54.186 --> 01:17:55.867]  Is he old enough to enlist?
[01:17:57.219 --> 01:17:57.859]  In the military?
[01:17:57.879 --> 01:17:59.519]  I don't know how old Scumbag is.
[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:03.020]  I don't know, but I'll give your audience a tip.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:07.301]  His screener is a witch, and she won't let you on.
[01:18:07.441 --> 01:18:16.403]  I called up and wanted to call him out on implanting microchips in kids, and she said, we're not talking about that, and she hangs up.
[01:18:16.443 --> 01:18:17.463]  You've got to call her up.
[01:18:17.543 --> 01:18:18.663]  You've got to lie.
[01:18:19.023 --> 01:18:23.924]  You've got to act stupid, and you've got to put on a front like you're an idiot liberal.
[01:18:24.471 --> 01:18:25.392]  And they'll put you on.
[01:18:25.752 --> 01:18:27.133]  And then when you get on, hammer them.
[01:18:27.473 --> 01:18:31.495]  Well, also, also, and again, it isn't lying in the classical sense.
[01:18:31.836 --> 01:18:34.457]  Like in the Bible, you know, they send the spies in and they lie.
[01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:38.059]  The point is, they're blocking the First Amendment.
[01:18:38.099 --> 01:18:39.440]  They're screening your calls.
[01:18:39.921 --> 01:18:42.762]  So you call in and you say you're going to talk about something else and you change your mind.
[01:18:43.403 --> 01:18:45.184]  You can also call and go, I love Sean!
[01:18:45.424 --> 01:18:49.767]  I want to talk about Ron Paul and how he wants to let the terrorists kill us.
[01:18:50.047 --> 01:18:51.848]  And use the term Islamofascists.
[01:18:53.991 --> 01:18:56.492]  Do you know that you can go solar for under 1200 bucks now?
[01:18:57.033 --> 01:18:58.153]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[01:18:58.353 --> 01:19:02.515]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:19:03.096 --> 01:19:07.978]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.

[01:19:15.666 --> 01:19:18.368]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[01:19:18.528 --> 01:19:28.494]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[01:19:28.774 --> 01:19:32.476]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[01:19:32.536 --> 01:19:39.040]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.240]  Are you ready to go solar?

[01:21:52.524 --> 01:21:55.786]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:21:56.026 --> 01:22:00.348]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[01:22:00.568 --> 01:22:08.432]  It's called Proto Grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:22:08.732 --> 01:22:11.573]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:22:11.853 --> 01:22:19.394]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:22:19.474 --> 01:22:25.075]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:30.856]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:22:31.136 --> 01:22:34.456]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:22:34.696 --> 01:22:38.037]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:22:38.277 --> 01:22:43.318]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Chief Superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:22:43.338 --> 01:22:46.198]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:22:46.238 --> 01:22:46.458]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:22:46.498 --> 01:22:48.159]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[01:23:09.608 --> 01:23:14.511]  George Strait was singing, the seashores of old Mexico.
[01:23:15.311 --> 01:23:20.113]  It sounded so good, I got an idea.
[01:23:20.173 --> 01:23:24.356]  I'm gonna go there since they're all over here.
[01:23:24.656 --> 01:23:28.958]  The long star state should be renamed Texico.
[01:23:35.122 --> 01:23:44.228]  No you won't!
[01:23:44.288 --> 01:23:46.930]  They'll take you in line, you up and blow your guts all over the walls.
[01:23:48.251 --> 01:23:50.813]  Hundreds of dead bodies routinely found buried all over the place.
[01:23:51.153 --> 01:23:53.595]  Let the federales have their way with women, you name it.
[01:23:54.535 --> 01:23:56.515]  We'll all be living like that soon enough here.
[01:23:56.795 --> 01:23:57.996]  Hello next.
[01:23:58.136 --> 01:23:59.856]  Hello being drug out of the car.
[01:23:59.896 --> 01:24:02.776]  Hello paying off cops at the side of the road.
[01:24:02.816 --> 01:24:03.477]  La la la.
[01:24:03.877 --> 01:24:06.297]  Total scum nation.
[01:24:06.317 --> 01:24:13.758]  I'll drive a rattle trap car with no liability.
[01:24:16.799 --> 01:24:21.280]  I'll demand equal rights though I'm there illegally.
[01:24:24.262 --> 01:24:28.544]  I'll protest in the streets till they finally grant them.
[01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:32.426]  Sing English words to their national anthem.
[01:24:32.446 --> 01:24:33.407]  Hey, Vincente!
[01:24:33.667 --> 01:24:36.709]  What's right for your people should be right for me.
[01:24:38.210 --> 01:24:43.035]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:24:43.975 --> 01:24:45.617]  By the way, remember the story.
[01:24:45.877 --> 01:24:46.678]  And we confirmed.
[01:24:49.701 --> 01:24:54.905]  We have confirmed that they didn't just arrest the guy that was protesting illegal aliens a few weeks ago in Seattle.
[01:24:55.185 --> 01:24:57.948]  They arrested anyone with signs peacefully protesting.
[01:24:58.448 --> 01:25:05.513]  Free speech is only allowed for the illegal aliens because, again, they've got to get that amnesty to complete the destruction of the country.
[01:25:05.793 --> 01:25:11.416]  And the cops work for the city councils that work for the private corporations that are absorbing the United States right now.
[01:25:12.897 --> 01:25:14.518]  It's really very simple.
[01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:21.122]  Now, I'm going to go over... Sean Hannity's show actually starts in an hour and a half.
[01:25:22.243 --> 01:25:25.085]  We don't want to give them the jump that we're going to do this, so let's just wait
[01:25:25.828 --> 01:25:27.970]  And at least he won't be able to take calls for the whole show.
[01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:29.191]  They'll probably just suspend calls.
[01:25:29.811 --> 01:25:31.092]  Then we'll hit him again on Monday.
[01:25:31.893 --> 01:25:32.834]  Keep it going on Monday.
[01:25:33.354 --> 01:25:33.935]  Write a note.
[01:25:34.735 --> 01:25:37.718]  And call in and just go, Hi Sean, you're a great American.
[01:25:37.998 --> 01:25:40.160]  Yeah, I just want to talk about the traitor Ron Paul.
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:43.542]  I want to talk about how we need to stay in Iraq and finish the job.
[01:25:43.883 --> 01:25:48.646]  I want to talk about how the embassy plan is pretty reasonable and we've got to get something.
[01:25:49.127 --> 01:25:50.348]  I agree with Sean.
[01:25:51.164 --> 01:25:52.645]  And just go, oh yeah!
[01:25:53.086 --> 01:25:54.347]  And then that's how you get through.
[01:25:54.387 --> 01:25:55.888]  And then you hit them hard once you get on.
[01:25:55.908 --> 01:25:58.070]  So you don't have to do that here.
[01:25:58.110 --> 01:25:59.531]  You just call your name, where you're calling from.
[01:25:59.551 --> 01:26:00.912]  If you disagree, you go to the other line.
[01:26:01.352 --> 01:26:02.693]  Because we can defend our ideas.
[01:26:03.314 --> 01:26:12.061]  Black Op operations where they say every child needs a microchip, arrest all militias, he's for gun control, he's for the amnesty plan because he wants to get tough on the borders.
[01:26:12.621 --> 01:26:16.965]  I've heard him, oh well, the plan's not perfect, but you know it does something and we've got to get behind our president.
[01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:20.668]  And people call in and go, hey Sean, you're not really
[01:26:21.625 --> 01:26:23.649]  Hey, I'm just as tough as you are on the border, buddy.
[01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:24.751]  Are you saying I'm not tough?
[01:26:25.392 --> 01:26:32.584]  We're going to give you the latest Ron Paul news, get into a recap on how our police are going to be Mexicans from Mexico now.
[01:26:33.328 --> 01:26:34.869]  And a lot more coming up in the next segment.
[01:26:34.889 --> 01:26:35.769]  I'll give you some phone numbers.
[01:26:35.809 --> 01:26:37.210]  But right now, let's keep going.
[01:26:37.230 --> 01:26:38.891]  Let's get one more call in before we go to break.
[01:26:39.851 --> 01:26:42.313]  Let's talk to Robert in California.
[01:26:42.353 --> 01:26:42.853]  You're on the air.
[01:26:43.894 --> 01:26:45.474]  Buenos dias, Alejandro.
[01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:47.115]  This is Roberto from Mexico.
[01:26:47.415 --> 01:26:47.996]  How you doing?
[01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:51.417]  You better not protest those illegals or the cops will beat you down.
[01:26:51.437 --> 01:26:52.998]  That just happened in San Diego.
[01:26:53.018 --> 01:26:58.781]  They're allowed to attack citizens, and if citizens have video of being attacked, the police then charge you.
[01:26:59.101 --> 01:27:00.022]  Same thing in Seattle.
[01:27:00.602 --> 01:27:02.263]  Yeah, that's right, sir.
[01:27:02.983 --> 01:27:07.626]  You know, I wrote you an article, a rough draft of an article, and it's already being heard about Ron Paul.
[01:27:08.066 --> 01:27:10.768]  But in it... Well, I mean, did you put it up on Prison Planet?
[01:27:10.828 --> 01:27:11.868]  I mean, is it up on the sites?
[01:27:13.449 --> 01:27:17.091]  No, I haven't put it... I haven't got that website yet, or that link yet.
[01:27:17.551 --> 01:27:18.692]  Okay, how long ago did you write it?
[01:27:18.712 --> 01:27:26.476]  Let me see... I dated it... How long ago did you email it to us?
[01:27:27.457 --> 01:27:27.737]  Monday.
[01:27:28.597 --> 01:27:29.578]  And nobody put it up?
[01:27:30.447 --> 01:27:31.107]  Uh, nobody put it up.
[01:27:31.167 --> 01:27:32.167]  It was a rough draft, anyway.
[01:27:32.207 --> 01:27:34.388]  But anyway... Well, we can't post rough drafts, brother.
[01:27:34.908 --> 01:27:35.208]  Okay.
[01:27:35.288 --> 01:27:39.109]  We're so busy, we hardly got time to... to salt our food.
[01:27:39.549 --> 01:27:40.150]  Listen to me.
[01:27:40.190 --> 01:27:40.910]  Listen to me, folks.
[01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:41.730]  We need your help.
[01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:44.051]  But if you're gonna write articles, make sure we can just put them up.
[01:27:44.551 --> 01:27:44.791]  Okay.
[01:27:45.291 --> 01:27:47.691]  Uh, but there... but I added something else in it.
[01:27:47.912 --> 01:27:49.512]  Um... What would you like to say, sir?
[01:27:50.392 --> 01:28:00.636]  There is a, in February 28, 1933, the protective custody bill in Nazi Germany that gave them many of the established camps.
[01:28:01.036 --> 01:28:04.358]  I've been trying to locate that actual law.
[01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:09.740]  And that dovetails with the Texas law where the doctor can put you in jail without the police or a judge.
[01:28:10.658 --> 01:28:10.938]  Right.
[01:28:10.998 --> 01:28:13.960]  Do you know of any website where they actually have that?
[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:15.181]  I've read about it in books.
[01:28:15.241 --> 01:28:16.181]  I know it was passed.
[01:28:16.221 --> 01:28:18.442]  I know the Nazis arrested people without habeas corpus.
[01:28:18.462 --> 01:28:18.582]  Right.
[01:28:18.602 --> 01:28:20.203]  I mean, that's not debated.
[01:28:20.283 --> 01:28:20.724]  I mean, you know.
[01:28:21.224 --> 01:28:28.348]  Yeah, I'm just trying to find that so I can actually get the wordings and see if it... Yeah, a lot of stuff, a lot of old stuff isn't online yet.
[01:28:28.748 --> 01:28:30.009]  It's in scholarly books.
[01:28:30.349 --> 01:28:31.890]  But hey, thanks for writing an article for us.
[01:28:31.930 --> 01:28:32.970]  Finish it up and send it to us.
[01:28:33.210 --> 01:28:33.671]  We'll get it up.
[01:28:33.691 --> 01:28:34.171]  Anything else?
[01:28:34.991 --> 01:28:35.872]  Uh, no, no sir.
[01:28:35.892 --> 01:28:36.392]  Have a good day.
[01:28:36.432 --> 01:28:37.673]  Hey, God bless you, sir.
[01:28:37.733 --> 01:28:38.233]  Keep it up.
[01:28:38.753 --> 01:28:39.774]  All right, we'll be right back.
[01:28:44.118 --> 01:28:47.120]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.041 --> 01:28:50.724]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.897 --> 01:28:58.479]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:28:58.879 --> 01:29:01.821]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:29:02.141 --> 01:29:04.702]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:29:05.062 --> 01:29:09.884]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:29:10.264 --> 01:29:15.627]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:29:15.927 --> 01:29:18.908]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[01:29:19.088 --> 01:29:19.648]  We're good to go.
[01:29:42.501 --> 01:29:49.227]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:29:50.528 --> 01:29:51.008]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:57.234]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:29:57.954 --> 01:30:03.119]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[01:30:04.025 --> 01:30:10.909]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[01:30:11.970 --> 01:30:20.555]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[01:30:21.656 --> 01:30:29.601]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:06.715]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call Mangosteen.
[01:31:07.016 --> 01:31:12.602]  It's a century-old medicinal fruit whose time has come, and it has amassed 40 years of published research.
[01:31:12.882 --> 01:31:17.884]  We have information and testimonials from all over the world about the health potential of this amazing fruit.
[01:31:18.104 --> 01:31:24.506]  The powerful botanical has contributed to the well-being of millions of people the world over with health concerns just like yours.

[01:31:28.127 --> 01:31:32.229]  We'll also offer you a website with links to actual testimonials and product information.

[01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:42.514]  Find out why mangosteen is known as the queen of all fruits and why it's fast becoming the best-selling wellness product ever brought to the market.

[01:31:44.615 --> 01:31:45.816]  Do something about it today.
[01:31:46.096 --> 01:31:46.256]  Call 800-658-0597.
[01:31:46.276 --> 01:31:46.576]  Again, that's 800-658-0597.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:19.781]  We are at the crossroads, as I said at the beginning of the broadcast.
[01:32:20.741 --> 01:32:24.441]  The North American Union is being put together right now.
[01:32:25.182 --> 01:32:30.643]  They're trying to set up the world tax on fossil fuels and, quote, carbon footprints.
[01:32:31.363 --> 01:32:35.503]  They're now announcing one-child policies they want to have in England and the United States and Europe.
[01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:39.644]  They are driving ahead with a total, complete amnesty plus.
[01:32:39.864 --> 01:32:43.765]  Worse than amnesty, it is total capitulation, the end of the United States,
[01:32:44.711 --> 01:32:54.999]  It is absolute amnesty in allowing 11 plus family members to come in with them and unlimited skilled and unskilled visas to be allowed to bring in record numbers on top of who already is here.
[01:32:55.319 --> 01:32:57.981]  It will cause a giant rush of people coming into the country.
[01:32:58.522 --> 01:33:04.246]  Santa Fe Police Department is announcing they want to recruit Mexican Citizen Police to police Americans.
[01:33:04.527 --> 01:33:07.189]  We already know that's going on in many areas, but here they are announcing it.
[01:33:07.449 --> 01:33:12.593]  They're announcing expansions of foreign troops to make up our military, radically expanding foreign recruiting centers.
[01:33:13.966 --> 01:33:19.670]  Uh, the Pentagon and NORTHCOM has announced they'll use Mexican and Canadian troops to, quote, deal with American terrorists on domestic soil.
[01:33:19.710 --> 01:33:28.376]  Bush has set up martial law provisions in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007, passed last year, federalizing the governorships and the national and state guards.
[01:33:29.236 --> 01:33:31.978]  Uh, it's just, folks, everything is off the charts right now.
[01:33:32.278 --> 01:33:33.159]  And they are set.
[01:33:33.219 --> 01:33:34.240]  Bush has announced the deal.
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:35.821]  The Senate's made a deal with the House.
[01:33:35.881 --> 01:33:36.821]  Bush has made a deal with them.
[01:33:37.282 --> 01:33:43.686]  It looks like they've got the votes right now to pass complete amnesty next week.
[01:33:46.088 --> 01:33:51.432]  It doesn't matter if 75% of the American people plus one out of the war and over 70% of the troops in major polls.
[01:33:51.952 --> 01:33:54.374]  It doesn't matter if 99% don't want these toll roads.
[01:33:54.994 --> 01:33:55.715]  97, excuse me.
[01:33:56.415 --> 01:34:04.481]  It doesn't matter if 99% in Gallup polls don't want the New London Kelo decision on grabbing private property for private interest without just compensation.
[01:34:04.761 --> 01:34:07.003]  It doesn't matter if 90% don't want amnesty.
[01:34:07.023 --> 01:34:08.504]  91% in the last Gallup poll.
[01:34:08.864 --> 01:34:09.805]  They don't care!
[01:34:09.825 --> 01:34:12.567]  They're going, we're bringing in fire in El Jefe's!
[01:34:13.007 --> 01:34:14.788]  We're bringing in foreign patrons.
[01:34:15.108 --> 01:34:16.709]  You're going to live like peons.
[01:34:16.969 --> 01:34:19.331]  We're bringing you the old world corrupt system.
[01:34:19.571 --> 01:34:20.712]  You're going to be slaves.
[01:34:20.932 --> 01:34:22.573]  The roads are going to be toll roads.
[01:34:22.793 --> 01:34:24.093]  We're going to take your children.
[01:34:24.294 --> 01:34:25.534]  We're going to break you down.
[01:34:25.754 --> 01:34:26.975]  We're going to take you low.
[01:34:27.175 --> 01:34:29.036]  We're going to devalue your currency.
[01:34:29.276 --> 01:34:30.677]  This is the new world order.
[01:34:33.059 --> 01:34:38.802]  And if I've been biting the heads off callers earlier, been a little bit angry and aggressive, it's because I really, folks, I am
[01:34:41.047 --> 01:34:41.547]  This is it!
[01:34:41.667 --> 01:34:45.949]  I mean, we're watching it, and we're watching these creatures butcher the Bill of Rights.
[01:34:46.330 --> 01:34:50.972]  We're watching them cheat Ron Paul and try to kick him out of the debates because he was winning.
[01:34:51.332 --> 01:34:52.513]  Just the cheating alone.
[01:34:52.833 --> 01:34:54.594]  We're watching him lie and scam.
[01:34:54.634 --> 01:35:02.678]  I have a whole stack here where Fox News was caught for a full day posting that Rudolph Giuliani won the debates and putting up fake poll numbers.
[01:35:02.738 --> 01:35:03.978]  We have screenshots.
[01:35:04.599 --> 01:35:05.759]  We have the article.
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:09.321]  Fake poll numbers now.
[01:35:09.972 --> 01:35:14.633]  And then when they took that down, they said Mitt Romney did and said Ron Paul was second tier.
[01:35:16.473 --> 01:35:27.515]  And then all, I mean, just the lying, the cheating, and then trying to block our electoral voting process so we can't see the man who's the real frontrunner as they panic to do this.
[01:35:29.636 --> 01:35:34.277]  And the New York Times saying Ron Paul's for torture and didn't speak out against it, which he did.
[01:35:34.997 --> 01:35:36.777]  I've got a whole stack of deception here.
[01:35:38.254 --> 01:35:40.395]  I have a giant stack of deception here.
[01:35:40.615 --> 01:35:42.875]  There's a big video clip up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:42.915 --> 01:35:43.735]  I want to air on it.
[01:35:44.275 --> 01:35:47.196]  Rosie O'Donnell yesterday talking about our governments behind the terror.
[01:35:47.516 --> 01:35:49.337]  Then we play a clip from TerrorStorm in the clip.
[01:35:49.697 --> 01:35:58.619]  But John Gibson all lying and freaking out and doing everything else he does and I've just got all these calls I want to take and it's just unbelievable.
[01:35:59.059 --> 01:36:00.279]  Let me just do this right now.
[01:36:00.659 --> 01:36:03.600]  Get your pens and paper right now as I ask you to do in the first hour.
[01:36:06.641 --> 01:36:07.821]  Now don't call this yet.
[01:36:08.974 --> 01:36:12.517]  And I know there'll be Sean Hannity supporters who will call the number and tell him to get ready for it.
[01:36:12.577 --> 01:36:13.058]  I don't care.
[01:36:13.918 --> 01:36:20.444]  But just call once the show starts, maybe call a little bit before, or a few minutes before, and then just call, call, call, call later in the day.
[01:36:20.484 --> 01:36:21.785]  Just keep trying, you'll get through.
[01:36:22.786 --> 01:36:27.030]  And bottom line, let them know that we're fully aware of their traitorous activities against Ron Paul.
[01:36:28.037 --> 01:36:34.762]  Let them know that we are aware that Hannity goes, well, it's not a perfect plan, but it's something and it'll build a fence.
[01:36:34.822 --> 01:36:35.443]  No, it doesn't.
[01:36:35.683 --> 01:36:36.664]  They just say that.
[01:36:36.904 --> 01:36:37.965]  It's a total amnesty.
[01:36:37.985 --> 01:36:39.966]  You won't need a fence because they're all legalized.
[01:36:41.427 --> 01:36:44.569]  If you can get here, you get a visa permanently for four years.
[01:36:44.589 --> 01:36:45.590]  You can bring your whole family.
[01:36:45.810 --> 01:36:46.191]  Period.
[01:36:48.612 --> 01:36:50.734]  So, we're going to go after Hannity today.
[01:36:50.854 --> 01:36:51.895]  Let me give you his number.
[01:36:52.575 --> 01:36:53.936]  Now, I want you to do all of this, folks.
[01:36:53.996 --> 01:36:54.777]  I'm asking you to.
[01:36:56.204 --> 01:36:57.065]  It's 1-800-941-Sean.
[01:36:57.185 --> 01:37:04.130]  I was about to call him a name.
[01:37:04.170 --> 01:37:05.131]  I just can't help it anymore.
[01:37:05.151 --> 01:37:06.492]  He's smirking and all of it.
[01:37:06.512 --> 01:37:06.972]  1-800-941-7326.
[01:37:06.992 --> 01:37:07.472]  Write that down.
[01:37:07.492 --> 01:37:07.593]  1-800-941-7326.
[01:37:07.633 --> 01:37:09.934]  By the way, I don't ask you to do anything I don't do.
[01:37:09.954 --> 01:37:13.757]  I'm going to call it when the show ends in an hour and 22 minutes from now.
[01:37:22.931 --> 01:37:23.271]  1-800-941-7326.
[01:37:23.291 --> 01:37:30.673]  In fact, it's better just for our people to start jamming it a few minutes before it starts.
[01:37:31.053 --> 01:37:33.054]  They may know about it and turn the phones off at first.
[01:37:33.094 --> 01:37:33.814]  Just keep trying.
[01:37:34.114 --> 01:37:35.555]  Never stop the full three hours.
[01:37:36.395 --> 01:37:39.536]  We're at least going to deny the phone line system to them.
[01:37:39.616 --> 01:37:45.697]  And then some of you pick to sneak through on them, claim you're a neocon, claim you're a liberal, act stupid, you'll get on.
[01:37:46.097 --> 01:37:47.798]  The caller earlier was absolutely right.
[01:37:49.185 --> 01:37:51.627]  If you are an articulate patriot, they do not want you on.
[01:37:51.647 --> 01:37:54.308]  They're here to pacify conservatives until it's too late.
[01:37:54.388 --> 01:37:56.230]  That's their number one job, is operatives.
[01:37:56.250 --> 01:38:00.412]  I just had to read about Limbaugh and Clinton at dinner.
[01:38:00.492 --> 01:38:01.753]  All good buddies now.
[01:38:01.813 --> 01:38:02.774]  It's so sick.
[01:38:02.794 --> 01:38:04.915]  1-800-941-7326 1-800-941-7326 Call it in an hour and twenty minutes from now.
[01:38:05.135 --> 01:38:05.296]  Okay?
[01:38:05.316 --> 01:38:06.156]  The Scumbag Sean Hannity Show.
[01:38:17.682 --> 01:38:19.063]  We're actually doing him a favor though.
[01:38:19.103 --> 01:38:23.326]  We've got a website ranked tens of thousands of times bigger than his and have a gigantic audience.
[01:38:23.366 --> 01:38:24.546]  He's a legend in his own mind.
[01:38:24.827 --> 01:38:27.508]  But it's important to let this punk know that we know what he is.
[01:38:27.948 --> 01:38:29.229]  Arrest every militia member.
[01:38:29.309 --> 01:38:30.050]  Ban militias.
[01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:31.891]  Make every child take a chip.
[01:38:32.191 --> 01:38:33.012]  Torture's good.
[01:38:33.072 --> 01:38:34.733]  Let's have open borders, Sean Hannity.
[01:38:35.413 --> 01:38:36.694]  You Judas goat.
[01:38:36.794 --> 01:38:37.615]  Piece of trash.
[01:38:38.615 --> 01:38:39.516]  Here's the other numbers.
[01:38:40.897 --> 01:38:41.717]  Keep calling this.
[01:38:41.757 --> 01:38:43.318]  Never stop and call it on Monday.
[01:38:43.358 --> 01:38:45.199]  Their phone systems are completely shut down.
[01:38:45.239 --> 01:38:46.080]  Call it right now.
[01:38:46.883 --> 01:38:51.347]  This is the phone line, ladies and gentlemen, to the RNC.
[01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:57.573]  We might need to put a note here on Prison Planet that it is the number to the RNC.
[01:38:58.373 --> 01:38:59.054]  It is at the bottom.
[01:38:59.334 --> 01:39:00.976]  Call the RNC now at 1-202-863-8500.
[01:39:00.996 --> 01:39:01.116]  202-863-8500.
[01:39:01.136 --> 01:39:05.840]  Jam their phone lines and let them know that we will not tolerate any effort.
[01:39:12.526 --> 01:39:16.870]  On behalf of any faction in the GOP to silence Ron Paul or kill the electoral process.
[01:39:17.130 --> 01:39:18.792]  We've done our own petition.
[01:39:19.232 --> 01:39:21.014]  It's also at the top of PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:39:21.054 --> 01:39:22.395]  It's the best one out there we've seen.
[01:39:22.415 --> 01:39:24.377]  We're also supporting the other petition.
[01:39:25.318 --> 01:39:25.979]  Go sign it.
[01:39:26.299 --> 01:39:27.320]  I looked at it last night.
[01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:29.082]  It had like 4,000 signatures.
[01:39:29.102 --> 01:39:29.963]  I don't know what it is now.
[01:39:30.383 --> 01:39:31.664]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:39:32.044 --> 01:39:33.246]  Sign our petition.
[01:39:33.306 --> 01:39:37.670]  It's PetitionOnline.com forward slash Ron Paul
[01:39:38.689 --> 01:39:40.610]  forward slash petition dot html.
[01:39:41.191 --> 01:39:44.833]  But the O in Ron Paul is a zero.
[01:39:45.134 --> 01:39:47.535]  That way we can get an easier domain back end.
[01:39:48.236 --> 01:39:52.899]  The point is, just get in there and sign the petition ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:52.979 --> 01:39:54.741]  That just automatically gets delivered to Congress.
[01:39:54.761 --> 01:39:57.723]  We're going to print out a copy and mail it to the RNC.
[01:39:59.073 --> 01:40:23.023]  But, again, you just let those pieces of trash know over there that we know they've hijacked the party, we know they're there for foreign interest, they're there to break down this nation, they're there to get our guns and get rid of our borders, and we know what a bucket of trash they are, and you just let the RNC know that we know who they are, and that we know they're traitors, and that we're never going to vote for any Republican that supports Ron Paul being barred from the debate.
[01:40:23.323 --> 01:40:25.464]  It's not like he's somebody who had 1% of the vote.
[01:40:26.969 --> 01:40:29.052]  That's why they've had these two debates with 10 people.
[01:40:29.692 --> 01:40:32.496]  Anybody who got below 10 points needs to be off the debates.
[01:40:33.017 --> 01:40:35.119]  Ron Paul got second place in the last one.
[01:40:35.339 --> 01:40:42.769]  He was at 33 points ahead of everybody in a 10-way race until they cheated and electioneered and said text against Paul on Fox News.
[01:40:43.507 --> 01:40:46.248]  And he won every major poll on the MSNBC one.
[01:40:46.468 --> 01:40:50.689]  And he's the talk of the country now, and it backfired on him, so now they're desperate.
[01:40:51.069 --> 01:40:54.010]  They tried to attack him and it backfired and made him the talk of the nation.
[01:40:54.270 --> 01:41:03.532]  By the way, on Yahoo, most searched terms, Yahoo, the biggest web system in the world, number one on the web, guess who was number eight in most searched to the top ten terms?
[01:41:03.752 --> 01:41:05.213]  Ron Paul yesterday.
[01:41:05.673 --> 01:41:07.093]  That's a whole other article right there.
[01:41:07.453 --> 01:41:09.094]  He's got mega buzz.
[01:41:10.313 --> 01:41:18.560]  For once they're not talking about Jessica Simpson's underwear, or some other starlet not wearing underwear, getting out of some limo.
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:19.241]  Who cares?
[01:41:19.521 --> 01:41:20.802]  That doesn't affect your family.
[01:41:21.102 --> 01:41:21.923]  This does.
[01:41:23.364 --> 01:41:31.531]  To every veteran, to every police officer who isn't a traitor to America, to anybody who really cares about this country, if you don't call this number, you're a traitor.
[01:41:31.551 --> 01:41:32.772]  202-863-8500.
[01:41:32.852 --> 01:41:35.775]  And you let them know they're the traitors.
[01:41:36.075 --> 01:41:36.575]  And on top of it,
[01:41:41.110 --> 01:41:43.752]  On top of it, here's the most important thing I want to give out.
[01:41:43.832 --> 01:41:45.093]  Where is it in my stack?
[01:41:45.233 --> 01:41:45.774]  I had it.
[01:41:47.775 --> 01:41:49.797]  You can tell I'm angry.
[01:41:49.977 --> 01:41:51.278]  Where is my Senate numbers?
[01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:55.562]  I had my Senate numbers here.
[01:41:55.582 --> 01:41:58.044]  Try keeping track of this, folks.
[01:41:59.225 --> 01:42:00.486]  They brought them in here a minute ago.
[01:42:00.886 --> 01:42:02.467]  Here it is, the numbers to the Senate.
[01:42:07.571 --> 01:42:09.433]  Alright, here is the online
[01:42:10.643 --> 01:42:11.164]  Here's the U.S.
[01:42:11.204 --> 01:42:12.225]  Capitol switchboard.
[01:42:12.825 --> 01:42:14.046]  And they change these all the time.
[01:42:14.066 --> 01:42:15.207]  This was printed off this morning.
[01:42:15.247 --> 01:42:16.128]  They may have changed it.
[01:42:16.488 --> 01:42:18.470]  Here, let me just test it right now, live on air.
[01:42:19.151 --> 01:42:20.372]  Let's just do this right now.
[01:42:22.734 --> 01:42:26.197]  You understand, ladies and gentlemen, they're moving on us right now.
[01:42:26.257 --> 01:42:27.258]  They're bum-rushing us.
[01:42:27.278 --> 01:42:32.022]  They want Mexican police ruling over us, Mexican troops, open borders, total amnesty.
[01:42:33.203 --> 01:42:35.485]  Just trying to bar Ron Paul.
[01:42:35.885 --> 01:42:37.767]  They're bum-rushing us, the pack of criminals.
[01:42:38.484 --> 01:42:40.525]  And they're using the third world horde to get it done.
[01:42:41.385 --> 01:42:42.245]  It's ringing right now.
[01:42:42.265 --> 01:42:42.906]  You can hear it.
[01:42:47.567 --> 01:42:48.488]  Alright, come on!
[01:42:49.108 --> 01:42:50.248]  They're not answering over there.
[01:42:51.469 --> 01:42:51.969]  Classic.
[01:42:54.890 --> 01:43:02.493]  The switchboard routinely now just turns off and they just go about their business directing prostitutes to different Senators' apartments.
[01:43:03.658 --> 01:43:04.659]  That's mainly what they do.
[01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:10.845]  This is like the Roman Senate bringing in the Visigoths and the Angles and the rest of them right before Rome started falling.
[01:43:11.926 --> 01:43:13.388]  Yes, is this the Capitol switchboard?
[01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:15.349]  Fantastic.
[01:43:15.490 --> 01:43:17.872]  Can you give me Senator Specter's office, please?
[01:43:17.892 --> 01:43:21.776]  Okay, now I've been transferred to...
[01:43:22.893 --> 01:43:23.854]  The line is busy?
[01:43:24.514 --> 01:43:35.680]  Well, just the American people, I know you're just answering the phone, just want to even let the switchboard know that we're aware that he is a traitor to America for his attempt to destroy the United States with a complete amnesty plan.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:36.340]  Thank you.
[01:43:37.461 --> 01:43:42.183]  Alright, so the traitor scumbag Arlen Specter's office is busy.
[01:43:42.503 --> 01:43:47.986]  If you live in Maryland, if you live in D.C., if you live in Virginia, I want you to get in your car right now.
[01:43:48.985 --> 01:43:53.789]  And I want you to go to the Capitol right now, and I want you to march into that piece of trash's office.
[01:43:54.249 --> 01:43:56.831]  And I want you to let him know that we know he's a traitor.
[01:43:57.491 --> 01:43:59.933]  He got up there and said, this will restore the rule of law.
[01:44:00.013 --> 01:44:00.954]  What a joke!
[01:44:01.774 --> 01:44:07.559]  This takes it and tells all these criminals that they're instantly legalized, and they can bring in whoever they want.
[01:44:07.779 --> 01:44:10.721]  And they can go suck off the welfare memories.
[01:44:13.616 --> 01:44:17.697]  I want you to call 202-224-3121.
[01:44:17.717 --> 01:44:19.598]  202-224-3121.
[01:44:21.279 --> 01:44:32.383]  More importantly, I want you to get the constituent offices, we can't give all these numbers out, to Specter and his district, and his state office, and to your congressmen and women's offices.
[01:44:32.683 --> 01:44:41.706]  You get off your butt, you call information, you go online, you find out their numbers, and you call their district offices, and you go in there.
[01:44:42.569 --> 01:44:43.710]  And you throw a fit!
[01:44:45.171 --> 01:44:46.733]  That'll get their attention!
[01:44:49.235 --> 01:44:51.457]  That'll get these traitorous scums attention.
[01:44:53.498 --> 01:44:59.584]  And while you're at it, you tell them how dare these criminal scumbags try to destroy our country and try to kick Ron Paul out of the debates.
[01:44:59.604 --> 01:44:59.644]  202-224-3121.
[01:44:59.664 --> 01:44:59.704]  202-224-3121.
[01:45:09.094 --> 01:45:09.214]  2-0-2!
[01:45:09.234 --> 01:45:10.135]  2-2-4!
[01:45:10.155 --> 01:45:10.776]  31-21!
[01:45:10.796 --> 01:45:11.658]  2-0-2!
[01:45:11.678 --> 01:45:12.780]  2-2-4!
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:12.820]  31-21!
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:17.607]  This is the natural way to behave when you're being completely overrun.
[01:45:17.768 --> 01:45:20.592]  They're announcing foreign troops and police are going to rule over you.
[01:45:20.873 --> 01:45:22.135]  Do you understand they're really doing it?
[01:45:25.752 --> 01:45:27.432]  Oh my gosh, this is so bad.
[01:45:27.452 --> 01:45:28.753]  202-224-3121.
[01:45:28.773 --> 01:45:31.533]  Let me just give you individual numbers.
[01:45:31.553 --> 01:45:33.734]  We're going to get these all up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:45:33.994 --> 01:45:36.054]  At Congress.com, they've got all the phone numbers.
[01:45:36.314 --> 01:45:38.735]  Paul Watson's posting it all on the main page right now.
[01:45:39.415 --> 01:45:40.655]  I wanted Sean Hannity.
[01:45:40.915 --> 01:45:42.396]  Number one is going after Congress.
[01:45:42.796 --> 01:45:46.697]  Number two, on the Immigration Total Amnesty Plan.
[01:45:47.437 --> 01:45:48.457]  The Death of America Plan.
[01:45:49.415 --> 01:45:52.423]  Number two is defending Ron Paul, making sure he stays in the debate.
[01:45:52.703 --> 01:45:54.307]  And number three is a political action.
[01:45:54.368 --> 01:45:58.337]  You crawl in and take over Sean Hannity's show in one hour and thirteen minutes.
[01:46:05.157 --> 01:46:07.058]  Just call all their numbers, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:07.479 --> 01:46:12.982]  Call Barbara Boxer and let everybody know, let her office know that we know she's a traitor and she isn't going to vote against it.
[01:46:13.203 --> 01:46:25.131]  Just let her know that we're aware of how she's playing race politics and trying to drive down the wages and trying to destroy America and that she thinks she's going to handle and rule over an illegal alien horde they're going to use to riot on cue.
[01:46:25.411 --> 01:46:28.173]  You let that traitorous piece of filth know we're aware of her.
[01:46:28.573 --> 01:46:29.514]  202-224-3553.
[01:46:31.896 --> 01:46:35.679]  And you let them know that we know it's treason and it's not even our government anymore.
[01:46:35.699 --> 01:46:36.420]  Just let them know.
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:37.741]  202-224-3553.
[01:46:39.403 --> 01:46:41.865]  I rarely give out Congressional numbers.
[01:46:42.065 --> 01:46:43.907]  Remember when I did two months before 9-11?
[01:46:44.127 --> 01:46:46.709]  I said call them and let them know we know they're going to attack the World Trade Center?
[01:46:48.411 --> 01:46:51.333]  Well, what you're about to see is going to be even bigger than that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:51.353 --> 01:46:53.695]  Remember I said call them and let them know we know the government's behind it?
[01:46:53.955 --> 01:46:55.497]  And to stop it and call the White House?
[01:46:56.505 --> 01:46:59.267]  Well, call them and let them know that we know this is the end of America.
[01:46:59.327 --> 01:47:07.253]  Then they have the nerve to say it isn't an amnesty, but then they keep the bill secret, but the details of it are leaked, that it's a Z visa that legalizes everyone.
[01:47:09.094 --> 01:47:11.416]  They don't even have to leave the country once a year for their visa.
[01:47:15.179 --> 01:47:18.221]  Every one of these pieces of filth makes me sick.
[01:47:18.241 --> 01:47:19.422]  Just call every one of them.
[01:47:20.178 --> 01:47:22.284]  I mean, just go down the line and never stop.
[01:47:22.324 --> 01:47:26.899]  But key, not just our millions of listeners, what you did yesterday when we started the Ron Paul revolt...
[01:47:27.711 --> 01:47:33.755]  And when we got, and it started a firestorm, and again I don't care about the getting credit for it, I want to give you the listeners credit.
[01:47:34.055 --> 01:47:50.184]  It started here, you told ten friends, and told their email list, and told the MySpace, that told the Yahoo account, that told the, and it's just all over talk radio, I even heard it on mainstream talk radio, to call and keep Ron Paul in the debates, and a revolt is on!
[01:47:50.924 --> 01:47:56.808]  And by making Neocon Talk Show host attack Ron Paul, it shows their listeners that they're really traitors and aren't real conservatives.
[01:48:00.143 --> 01:48:01.763]  It's making people choose sides.
[01:48:05.084 --> 01:48:06.565]  Bush says they've got a deal.
[01:48:07.145 --> 01:48:12.086]  Bush says the Senate's made a deal to pass this next Monday or Tuesday, and that the House has made a deal to pass it.
[01:48:13.367 --> 01:48:18.508]  Ninety-one percent of Americans don't want this, and that's Americans not even knowing one-tenth of how bad this is.
[01:48:18.968 --> 01:48:19.969]  What's the government's answer?
[01:48:20.469 --> 01:48:21.669]  We don't care, we're going to do it.
[01:48:23.371 --> 01:48:25.531]  Well, we've got to let these traders know that we're aware.
[01:48:25.571 --> 01:48:29.412]  And I told you, folks, you tell them, we're going to every one of the meetings you're at.
[01:48:29.872 --> 01:48:30.573]  We're going to go to it.
[01:48:30.633 --> 01:48:33.673]  And don't listen to me to give you the, tell you where they're going to be.
[01:48:34.313 --> 01:48:37.234]  You just call their office and you say, where is his next public event?
[01:48:37.454 --> 01:48:40.075]  Or you go to their websites and it'll say where it is.
[01:48:40.795 --> 01:48:45.256]  And then you come out and you get them by the hand and you squeeze their hand.
[01:48:45.276 --> 01:48:48.136]  You look them in the eye and you say, you traitor, piece of filth.
[01:48:48.536 --> 01:48:51.237]  You better stop selling us out for 30 pieces of silver.
[01:48:52.248 --> 01:48:54.149]  I'm going to campaign for your opposition.
[01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:57.431]  And go get a bullhorn and bullhorn outside their house.
[01:48:57.711 --> 01:48:59.212]  I don't care if it's one of you doing it.
[01:49:00.553 --> 01:49:02.074]  In fact, I think I'm going to go get a bullhorn.
[01:49:02.094 --> 01:49:04.955]  I'm going to go bullhorn Lloyd Doggett's house next week.
[01:49:06.116 --> 01:49:08.177]  We'll see how that piece of trash likes it.
[01:49:09.098 --> 01:49:10.138]  Let me tell you something.
[01:49:10.378 --> 01:49:12.980]  We've got to do everything we can to save this country.
[01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:15.381]  Because it isn't just America that's falling.
[01:49:15.421 --> 01:49:16.082]  It's all the liberties.
[01:49:16.142 --> 01:49:16.762]  It's the freedoms.
[01:49:17.022 --> 01:49:18.443]  It's America being overrun.
[01:49:19.511 --> 01:49:22.173]  This is the global military assault, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:22.394 --> 01:49:23.334]  We're under attack!
[01:49:23.575 --> 01:49:24.515]  Global mayday!
[01:49:24.916 --> 01:49:25.736]  Global mayday!
[01:49:25.776 --> 01:49:27.398]  The United States is falling!
[01:49:27.638 --> 01:49:29.520]  It's completely falling right now!
[01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:32.482]  The electoral process is being blocked.
[01:49:32.682 --> 01:49:34.164]  Our borders have been lowered.
[01:49:34.224 --> 01:49:35.345]  Our shields have been lowered.
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:41.702]  Our corporations have radicalized the illegal aliens and they're using them as a weapon against what's left of our country.
[01:49:41.923 --> 01:49:42.703]  Help us!
[01:49:43.503 --> 01:49:44.324]  Worldwide!
[01:49:44.404 --> 01:49:47.625]  I want people in foreign countries to help us who are under the same attack!
[01:49:48.025 --> 01:49:49.346]  We're all under attack!
[01:49:49.746 --> 01:49:51.267]  The West is under attack!
[01:49:57.074 --> 01:50:00.255]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.576 --> 01:50:02.536]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.897 --> 01:50:10.520]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.215 --> 01:50:18.279]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.679 --> 01:50:30.105]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.405 --> 01:50:33.947]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.368 --> 01:50:36.329]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.649 --> 01:50:40.491]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:55.626 --> 01:51:00.148]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:51:00.448 --> 01:51:04.550]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:51:04.830 --> 01:51:05.370]  We listened.
[01:51:05.690 --> 01:51:10.672]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:51:10.952 --> 01:51:11.433]  We listened.
[01:51:11.813 --> 01:51:14.854]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:51:15.274 --> 01:51:15.814]  We listened.
[01:51:16.275 --> 01:51:19.436]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:51:19.616 --> 01:51:20.337]  Power Outages.
[01:51:20.717 --> 01:51:21.198]  We listened.
[01:51:21.538 --> 01:51:26.785]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:51:27.205 --> 01:51:28.547]  Again, we listened.
[01:51:28.927 --> 01:51:30.489]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[01:51:30.689 --> 01:51:36.256]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:51:36.696 --> 01:51:39.337]  Get the Berkey Lite at the American Water Purifier.
[01:51:39.537 --> 01:51:39.737]  Only $279.
[01:51:39.798 --> 01:51:40.378]  Call New Millennium 888-03-4438.
[01:51:40.418 --> 01:51:40.658]  That's 888-03-4438.

[01:51:42.359 --> 01:51:43.319]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:52.941 --> 01:51:54.662]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:54.882 --> 01:51:58.584]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:58.904 --> 01:52:01.126]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:52:01.626 --> 01:52:07.849]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:07.989 --> 01:52:12.852]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.092 --> 01:52:22.117]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[01:52:22.458 --> 01:52:28.421]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[01:53:00.762 --> 01:53:05.184]  At the FEMA camps they plan to take your women from you and rape them in front of you.
[01:53:06.064 --> 01:53:08.445]  They plan to blow your children's heads off.
[01:53:09.005 --> 01:53:10.926]  Those that aren't shipped to Saudi Arabia.
[01:53:12.567 --> 01:53:14.667]  You think I'm joking about this government?
[01:53:15.628 --> 01:53:17.729]  They are going to have their way with this country.
[01:53:17.889 --> 01:53:19.209]  That's what they like to do.
[01:53:19.229 --> 01:53:21.290]  That's the extreme of what they like to do.
[01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:24.351]  They've already done it to 3,000 plus children they've taken in Florida.
[01:53:24.571 --> 01:53:28.553]  They already take black children in New York and feed them pesticides till they die.
[01:53:31.570 --> 01:53:32.512]  Total evil!
[01:53:33.113 --> 01:53:33.534]  All of them!
[01:53:33.614 --> 01:53:37.562]  George Bush, Barbara Boxer, Hillary Clinton, Chuckie Schumer, all of them!
[01:53:38.325 --> 01:53:39.525]  They're all enemies!
[01:53:40.046 --> 01:53:40.466]  Enemies!
[01:53:40.946 --> 01:53:43.067]  And all they do is try to sit there cloaked.
[01:53:43.447 --> 01:53:44.307]  Camouflaged.
[01:53:44.427 --> 01:53:45.287]  It's military.
[01:53:45.728 --> 01:53:47.008]  They tell you what you want to hear.
[01:53:47.048 --> 01:53:48.208]  That's a camouflage.
[01:53:48.428 --> 01:53:50.069]  Like camouflage on a tank.
[01:53:50.649 --> 01:53:54.431]  Or camouflage on the underbelly of Sky Blue on an aircraft.
[01:53:54.911 --> 01:53:56.611]  They're enemy salvos.
[01:53:57.011 --> 01:53:58.912]  Launching at the heart of the Republic.
[01:53:59.212 --> 01:54:02.553]  Watching the Republic collapse before my very eyes.
[01:54:02.853 --> 01:54:06.915]  Makes my soul burn with volcanic fury!
[01:54:08.268 --> 01:54:10.230]  We are going to defeat these people.
[01:54:10.490 --> 01:54:13.312]  We are going to rise the sleeping giant.
[01:54:13.812 --> 01:54:17.775]  We are going to get the people involved and get them out of their comfort zones.
[01:54:18.055 --> 01:54:26.161]  Because as the enemy launches more and more of its operations, you will see the sleeping giant move forward against the New World Order.
[01:54:26.421 --> 01:54:30.765]  And you will see them crushed and defeated with God's help.
[01:54:31.764 --> 01:54:38.766]  With the shield of faith and the sword of truth, we will crush the New World Order!
[01:54:45.247 --> 01:54:49.408]  You gotta get angry, you gotta see the threat for what it is, you gotta get fired up!
[01:54:50.409 --> 01:54:53.189]  And stop mincing words, stop playing games.
[01:54:53.629 --> 01:54:56.230]  When you see these politicians, you tell them, Enemy!
[01:54:56.630 --> 01:54:57.430]  Enemy of mine!
[01:54:57.570 --> 01:54:58.591]  Enemy of America!
[01:54:58.991 --> 01:54:59.791]  Enemy of freedom!
[01:55:01.019 --> 01:55:02.821]  Enemy of the children!
[01:55:03.321 --> 01:55:04.262]  Enemy of beauty!
[01:55:04.802 --> 01:55:05.403]  You there!
[01:55:05.603 --> 01:55:06.164]  Enemy!
[01:55:06.724 --> 01:55:07.445]  Call them out!
[01:55:07.925 --> 01:55:08.506]  Enemies!
[01:55:09.326 --> 01:55:09.787]  Enemy!
[01:55:10.047 --> 01:55:11.528]  Stop just calling them enemy!
[01:55:11.889 --> 01:55:12.909]  Don't even use their name!
[01:55:12.949 --> 01:55:13.790]  They are enemy!
[01:55:14.471 --> 01:55:15.492]  They are enemy!
[01:55:15.992 --> 01:55:17.053]  You are the enemy!
[01:55:17.133 --> 01:55:17.814]  The enemy!
[01:55:18.054 --> 01:55:18.734]  The enemy!
[01:55:18.835 --> 01:55:19.475]  The enemy!
[01:55:19.675 --> 01:55:20.396]  The enemy!
[01:55:20.716 --> 01:55:22.217]  Our government is our enemy!
[01:55:22.598 --> 01:55:25.220]  Why do you think all their training manuals say patriots are the enemy?
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:27.122]  Because we're all that's left of America!
[01:55:27.302 --> 01:55:27.922]  Where they only
[01:55:28.903 --> 01:55:31.286]  Last line, the Guardian's defending!
[01:55:31.966 --> 01:55:35.810]  Of course they say patriots are the enemy, because they're the enemy of America!
[01:55:39.193 --> 01:55:53.067]  I want the spell to be broken right now that's on our police and military and government bureaucrats, and you know deep in your gut right now, that spell over you is being broken, and you know right now you've been under a spell of darkness, you've been under brainwashing and manipulation!
[01:55:53.797 --> 01:55:54.878]  You have been lied to!
[01:55:54.938 --> 01:55:56.360]  You are serving evil!
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:58.242]  You have been slowly twisted!
[01:55:58.622 --> 01:56:01.646]  It's not too late to come back and join us!
[01:56:03.208 --> 01:56:08.613]  I know I've got Kevin and Jeff and Jack and Josh and Mike, I don't know, and all these other people.
[01:56:09.655 --> 01:56:11.537]  I'm gonna be exhausted today, I'm just so mad.
[01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:36.969]  A secret bill and then we get excerpts of it and it's a total complete amnesty like all the other proposals and then they're announcing they want to have foreign Mexican police in the US Associated Press and Mexican troops and then they're trying to ban the forerunner Ron Paul and calling him second tier and Fox News put on their website for a day that Giuliani won and put fake numbers up.
[01:56:37.049 --> 01:56:38.450]  I mean, that's how they treat us?
[01:56:38.490 --> 01:56:39.570]  Like we're that stupid?
[01:56:40.131 --> 01:56:45.639]  And they pose as conservatives and talk about how they care about the troops all day when they hate their guts?
[01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.890]  Listen to me.
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:58.164]  I haven't plugged all day because I'm too busy fighting the New World Order, but a big part of fighting the New World Order is supporting us.
[01:56:58.704 --> 01:57:05.890]  So if you want to go to InfoWars.com and buy some of the books and videos and make copies of my videos and get them out to people to expose who the real criminals are, you're more than welcome.
[01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:07.291]  Because we need your support.
[01:57:07.331 --> 01:57:08.412]  InfoWars.com.
[01:57:08.712 --> 01:57:09.813]  InfoWars.com.
[01:57:10.013 --> 01:57:15.558]  Go to that website and get those videos and get those DVD burners and start making copies!
[01:57:15.638 --> 01:57:23.244]  And know, every time you make a copy and give it to somebody, that that's one more, one more piece of energy going into our fist.
[01:57:23.564 --> 01:57:26.487]  Smash it into their face and never stop.
[01:57:26.987 --> 01:57:30.730]  Do it with focus and do it with war making!
[01:57:33.793 --> 01:57:38.356]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.376 --> 01:57:38.436]  Now.
[01:57:50.578 --> 01:57:51.239]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.899 --> 01:57:52.960]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.661 --> 01:57:54.822]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.422 --> 01:57:56.243]  You want answers?
[01:57:57.004 --> 01:57:57.924]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.565 --> 01:58:02.308]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.749 --> 01:58:06.872]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.113 --> 01:58:09.915]  You've got to get the war spirit!
[01:58:10.635 --> 01:58:11.976]  You've got to make war!
[01:58:11.996 --> 01:58:13.378]  You've got to get on the warpath!
[01:58:13.398 --> 01:58:16.080]  You've got to feel it!
[01:58:17.077 --> 01:58:21.372]  And no, that's righteous indignation to cross the enemy!
[01:58:22.293 --> 01:58:24.334]  You've got to aggressively make war on them.
[01:58:24.514 --> 01:58:25.934]  That's why I call it Info Wars.
[01:58:26.354 --> 01:58:32.035]  You have to realize they declared war on us, they've attacked us, and we're declaring war right back on them.
[01:58:32.255 --> 01:58:34.636]  And we have it in our mind's eye.
[01:58:34.976 --> 01:58:36.977]  We have envisioned their destruction.
[01:58:37.357 --> 01:58:39.437]  We know they are going to be defeated.
[01:58:39.677 --> 01:58:40.978]  And they know it now.
[01:58:41.238 --> 01:58:43.618]  They can feel the spirit rising in us.
[01:58:43.978 --> 01:58:50.960]  They can feel the power of God radiating the good in the world to make a great stand against wickedness!
[01:58:52.205 --> 01:58:55.148]  Then your churches are nothing but devils!
[01:58:55.529 --> 01:58:56.610]  Telling you not to fight!
[01:58:56.830 --> 01:58:58.171]  Telling you not to be involved!
[01:58:58.371 --> 01:58:59.833]  Telling you not to get on the field!
[01:59:00.293 --> 01:59:02.756]  This is an incredible honor to be alive right now!
[01:59:02.776 --> 01:59:05.579]  And it's only gonna get more intense!
[01:59:07.361 --> 01:59:09.483]  Kevin in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:59:09.503 --> 01:59:13.007]  Yes, you're talking about militaries and the police?
[01:59:13.927 --> 01:59:14.148]  Yes.
[01:59:14.861 --> 01:59:25.128]  Up here at Fort, about 90 miles from here, last Thursday, the New York City Police were having applications to recruit soldiers for the NYPD.
[01:59:25.228 --> 01:59:26.689]  Well, that's most of the news.
[01:59:27.029 --> 01:59:28.050]  Police are soldiers.
[01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:32.513]  They've been running checkpoints, arresting families, door-to-door gun confiscation, perfect training.
[01:59:32.753 --> 01:59:37.957]  The UN documents admit that that's why they like to rotate Western troops through those peacekeeping offices for domestic ops.
[01:59:38.337 --> 01:59:39.157]  But that's nothing, sir.
[01:59:39.197 --> 01:59:44.421]  I'm talking about foreign troops in agreement to Police America and the Mexican Police, Associated Press.
[01:59:44.901 --> 01:59:46.181]  Well, it's something new.
[01:59:46.301 --> 01:59:47.322]  It was just recent, though.
[01:59:47.342 --> 01:59:48.422]  That's why I thought I'd tell you.
[01:59:48.442 --> 01:59:48.642]  No, no.
[01:59:48.682 --> 01:59:49.322]  It is important.
[01:59:49.562 --> 01:59:49.722]  No, no.
[01:59:49.762 --> 01:59:51.162]  They're accelerating the merger.
[01:59:51.482 --> 01:59:55.503]  Also, there are these, quote, shutdown bases from Texas to New York to California.
[01:59:55.543 --> 01:59:56.343]  It's everywhere, sir.
[01:59:56.924 --> 01:59:58.064]  Arkansas, Florida.
[01:59:58.864 --> 02:00:00.464]  They take Brooksville.
[02:00:00.524 --> 02:00:02.445]  Oh, we're going to give the old base to the police.
[02:00:02.765 --> 02:00:03.965]  But then the troops run it.
[02:00:04.165 --> 02:00:07.206]  They put a Homeland Security officer in it with a CIA officer.
[02:00:07.406 --> 02:00:08.686]  Then they merge it all together.
[02:00:11.207 --> 02:00:13.167]  Then they feed the cameras in, everything.
[02:00:15.720 --> 02:00:18.621]  To watch the people, not the illegal aliens that they control.
[02:00:19.621 --> 02:00:20.821]  Through Rob Allen and Co.
[02:00:20.861 --> 02:00:21.602]  based in Dallas.
[02:00:22.782 --> 02:00:26.903]  Well, I'm going to call my Senator Clinton and Schumer, I guess.
[02:00:26.943 --> 02:00:28.884]  What are you going to tell those two traitors?
[02:00:29.164 --> 02:00:31.604]  To vote against the embassy and any gun control.
[02:00:32.805 --> 02:00:37.786]  But obviously you know they don't care, so it's just good to give them a new call and just let them know that you know they're enemies of America.
[02:00:38.046 --> 02:00:41.827]  I'll just let them know, hey, we know you're scumbag traitors and you're guilty of treason.
[02:00:42.327 --> 02:00:44.208]  I think it's important for them to get that message.
[02:00:45.686 --> 02:00:48.008]  Yeah, well, it's a traitorous act is what it is.
[02:00:48.308 --> 02:00:48.508]  It is.
[02:00:48.528 --> 02:00:50.850]  Does it make you sick or is there something wrong with me?
[02:00:51.251 --> 02:00:55.474]  I mean, this is a serious stab to the heart that they're about to do on Monday.
[02:00:55.494 --> 02:00:57.576]  I mean, is there something wrong with me that I'm so upset right now?
[02:00:57.596 --> 02:00:59.418]  No, no, no.
[02:00:59.518 --> 02:01:00.739]  You have a good reaction.
[02:01:00.999 --> 02:01:03.681]  Here, up here, they want to shut down a GM plant, 400 jobs.
[02:01:04.762 --> 02:01:06.322]  Next year, by the end of next year.
[02:01:06.383 --> 02:01:08.083]  They're shutting everything down.
[02:01:08.143 --> 02:01:09.163]  Halliburton's leaving.
[02:01:09.183 --> 02:01:11.564]  I mean, every day some new corporation leaves.
[02:01:11.804 --> 02:01:14.425]  I mean, they're just, folks, they're evacuating us.
[02:01:14.865 --> 02:01:16.585]  The elites are evacuating.
[02:01:16.765 --> 02:01:18.206]  We are in deep trouble.
[02:01:18.266 --> 02:01:19.386]  God, help us.
[02:01:19.446 --> 02:01:21.087]  God, we're sorry we've been so evil.
[02:01:21.387 --> 02:01:24.268]  We're sorry for everything we've done, but give us a reprieve like Nineveh.
[02:01:24.688 --> 02:01:30.729]  Please, or at least have a great awakening so there's a larger remnant to resist as the things get darker.
[02:01:31.090 --> 02:01:32.530]  But for God's sakes,
[02:01:33.050 --> 02:01:36.052]  Help conservatives see how they've been deceived by the fake media.
[02:01:36.252 --> 02:01:37.513]  The fake conservative media.
[02:01:39.715 --> 02:01:42.837]  Yeah, well... Well, I'll let you go.
[02:01:43.477 --> 02:01:44.658]  Good to hear from you, Kevin.
[02:01:44.898 --> 02:01:47.320]  Jeff and Jeff and everybody else, we're gonna get to you when we get back.
[02:01:48.881 --> 02:01:50.882]  I shouldn't let myself get this mad, but my God.
[02:01:50.902 --> 02:01:53.344]  I just... I don't even know what to say anymore.
[02:01:53.364 --> 02:01:57.827]  I just... I don't even feel like even sitting in here.
[02:01:57.867 --> 02:01:59.248]  I just... I literally just want to...
[02:02:01.283 --> 02:02:06.808]  This is one of the days I just, uh... I feel like I could take on ten people, you know what I mean?
[02:02:06.828 --> 02:02:07.669]  I mean, I know I could.
[02:02:09.050 --> 02:02:12.333]  I know I could just, I know, right now, I could take on ten people right now.
[02:02:13.093 --> 02:02:15.896]  Because it's survival mode, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm just tied into that.
[02:02:17.457 --> 02:02:21.981]  And, uh... And maybe there's something wrong with me.
[02:02:22.201 --> 02:02:27.306]  Maybe, maybe I need to just go back to sleep, hand my guns in, work, have Mexican dribs, rule over my family,
[02:02:28.184 --> 02:02:31.426]  And just put a Mexican flag up in my yard.
[02:02:32.586 --> 02:02:33.427]  Maybe that's the answer.
[02:02:33.447 --> 02:02:38.009]  Just put Mexican flags up everywhere instead of American flags and just be honest about what it is.
[02:02:38.810 --> 02:02:40.711]  And just do what they want.
[02:02:40.751 --> 02:02:42.031]  Kick Ron Paul off the debate.
[02:02:42.072 --> 02:02:42.852]  Just give in to them.
[02:02:49.475 --> 02:02:54.945]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:55.305 --> 02:03:02.958]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:03.641 --> 02:03:10.705]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:11.085 --> 02:03:22.511]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.811 --> 02:03:26.273]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.794 --> 02:03:28.695]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:29.055 --> 02:03:32.897]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:47.955 --> 02:04:52.080]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:04:52.300 --> 02:04:54.062]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:04:54.322 --> 02:05:00.629]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:05:00.909 --> 02:05:07.036]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:05:07.276 --> 02:05:09.138]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:05:09.138 --> 02:05:09.338]  I think?
[02:05:25.822 --> 02:05:27.703]  Using pictures are easy to follow.

[02:05:30.544 --> 02:05:31.624]  Don't just treat symptoms.

[02:05:36.065 --> 02:05:39.186]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:39.266 --> 02:05:40.467]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:59.961 --> 02:06:13.269]  For those that didn't read the Associated Press, the Santa Fe Police Department wants to hire Mexican nationals, Mexican police, to come join their police department.
[02:06:14.970 --> 02:06:16.310]  This is the North American Union.
[02:06:16.851 --> 02:06:17.951]  There is real moves.
[02:06:18.532 --> 02:06:22.214]  More Republican Party leadership has come out and said, yeah, kick Ron Paul out of the debate.
[02:06:22.714 --> 02:06:24.035]  Looks like they're moving to do it.
[02:06:25.616 --> 02:06:27.237]  We're posting up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:06:27.277 --> 02:06:27.897]  It's been up there.
[02:06:31.431 --> 02:06:33.953]  A link to sign the petition that goes to Congress.
[02:06:34.454 --> 02:06:36.075]  This is the official petition website.
[02:06:36.555 --> 02:06:37.676]  The big petition website.
[02:06:38.356 --> 02:06:38.677]  I don't know.
[02:06:38.717 --> 02:06:40.278]  I haven't checked it since last night.
[02:06:40.298 --> 02:06:41.539]  It was $4,000 last night.
[02:06:41.959 --> 02:06:45.081]  To not have him kicked out of the debate, we're going to send that money to the RNC.
[02:06:46.763 --> 02:06:55.930]  Also, we're posting phone numbers to the Congress about the blanket total amnesty that we need to get up so we can stop them and links to a big website that has
[02:06:57.455 --> 02:06:59.556]  Congress.org, it has all the Senate's phone numbers.
[02:07:00.257 --> 02:07:02.218]  Right now, though, let's get some more of your calls out of the way.
[02:07:02.638 --> 02:07:04.199]  Jeff in Rhode Island, thanks for holding.
[02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:05.740]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[02:07:06.361 --> 02:07:08.242]  I am really... I've never seen it this bad.
[02:07:08.302 --> 02:07:08.882]  It's just... Yeah.
[02:07:08.902 --> 02:07:15.667]  You know, I do my war on talk radio here in Rhode Island.
[02:07:15.767 --> 02:07:17.928]  I've been trying to call in for so long.
[02:07:18.288 --> 02:07:19.549]  I'm honored that you took my phone call.
[02:07:20.309 --> 02:07:22.631]  I just want to tell you, I tried to call in months ago.
[02:07:23.051 --> 02:07:25.773]  We were on a FEMA list for federal funds.
[02:07:26.417 --> 02:07:29.518]  And I wanted to call in and ask you, um, what I should look for.
[02:07:29.978 --> 02:07:36.259]  But after, uh, you know, after a while I listened to you, you kind of gave me the skill of, uh, predicting what to look for.
[02:07:36.279 --> 02:07:47.921]  Um, we just had the, uh, state police and, uh, local officials trying to pass a bill, uh, where they can, without a warrant, get your phone records and your, uh, internet records.
[02:07:48.581 --> 02:07:53.763]  Um, just last week we had an anti-terrorism drill in, uh, one of the schools here.
[02:07:53.783 --> 02:07:56.083]  Um, it's,
[02:07:56.847 --> 02:07:57.728]  It's pretty bad.
[02:07:57.808 --> 02:08:01.072]  Even with the illegal aliens, it's really bad over down here.
[02:08:02.914 --> 02:08:06.938]  Well, I'm sure, just because it's more like 36 million, not 26 million.
[02:08:07.919 --> 02:08:13.986]  Well, even in this state, the percentage of people on disability is 20% of our population.
[02:08:14.326 --> 02:08:18.571]  Do you remember two and a half years ago, it was a headline in the
[02:08:20.157 --> 02:08:22.678]  What's the main newspaper there in Providence?
[02:08:22.698 --> 02:08:23.518]  The Providence Journal?
[02:08:23.538 --> 02:08:24.138]  Providence Journal.
[02:08:24.558 --> 02:08:28.259]  Yeah, they have the headline that the governor wants martial law power.
[02:08:28.299 --> 02:08:31.580]  And it said, if you criticize the government, you'll be arrested.
[02:08:32.401 --> 02:08:39.302]  And everybody freaked out and they beat the bill, but they actually announced, we're going to have it where if you criticize, it said the 1917 Sedition Act.
[02:08:43.609 --> 02:08:45.650]  I mean, folks, they're not playing games!
[02:08:46.330 --> 02:08:52.451]  They had a law they almost passed in Oregon, where if you protested, you'd get life in prison in a forced labor camp.
[02:08:52.571 --> 02:08:55.071]  It said, forced labor camp.
[02:08:56.171 --> 02:08:56.611]  Okay?
[02:08:56.691 --> 02:08:59.172]  I'm telling you, they're not joking around!
[02:09:00.512 --> 02:09:02.232]  And here in the Southwest, it's going to be bad.
[02:09:02.252 --> 02:09:06.913]  And we're going to have Mexican and other Latin American death squads literally ruling us.
[02:09:06.973 --> 02:09:10.034]  And you tell these dumb yuppies that, and they laugh and they snicker.
[02:09:10.074 --> 02:09:11.174]  They just don't understand.
[02:09:12.546 --> 02:09:13.126]  Yeah, and Alex?
[02:09:13.867 --> 02:09:14.507]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:09:14.887 --> 02:09:18.248]  I just wanted to tell you real quick, the RNC will not take my phone calls.
[02:09:19.729 --> 02:09:20.329]  What happens?
[02:09:20.569 --> 02:09:25.591]  They put me on hold after I tell them what I'm calling about, and I just sit there for hours.
[02:09:26.111 --> 02:09:26.791]  Well, you don't do that.
[02:09:26.831 --> 02:09:33.414]  You just keep calling back, and then you say, oh, yes, I... I tried, but it's a long distance for me, and it killed... It's really...
[02:09:34.646 --> 02:09:38.168]  Listen, my friend, you keep it up.
[02:09:38.369 --> 02:09:40.030]  Start a blog, start a website.
[02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:42.831]  I don't care if it looks ancient when you start it or imperfect.
[02:09:43.051 --> 02:09:44.352]  Start writing up what's happening.
[02:09:44.372 --> 02:09:51.676]  You know, call it Rhode Island Chronicles or something, dot org, and then you just fight them and you just get the word out and you'll meet like-minded people.
[02:09:52.077 --> 02:09:53.918]  Oh yeah, they're moving hard against us everywhere.
[02:09:55.379 --> 02:09:57.140]  See, people think I'm joking about all this.
[02:09:58.627 --> 02:10:06.353]  They're using tens of thousands of Nicaraguans and El Salvadorans in the death camps in Iraq.
[02:10:06.633 --> 02:10:08.534]  That is mainstream news.
[02:10:09.075 --> 02:10:27.028]  We told you that a year and a half before with Celica Stillo, who was, again, an army sniper, sheriff's deputy, then a border patrol agent, then high-level DEA, the main guy for all of Latin America, and he saw it, folks, and he reported on it, and I mean, it's just, we're in deep trouble.
[02:10:27.757 --> 02:10:28.338]  We're good to go.
[02:10:46.767 --> 02:10:49.028]  Oh my God, I just, I can't believe it.
[02:10:49.388 --> 02:10:51.069]  The feds are already using them for hitmen.
[02:10:51.089 --> 02:10:54.350]  In fact, if they ever try to whack me, it'll probably be Mexican troops that do it.
[02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:57.831]  Because we know they're doing a lot of their political hits using Mexican commandos.
[02:10:58.511 --> 02:11:00.452]  I mean, folks, this is, it's over!
[02:11:00.492 --> 02:11:01.192]  You understand?
[02:11:01.572 --> 02:11:02.333]  The jig's up!
[02:11:02.393 --> 02:11:04.493]  They're openly going to start hiring Mexican police!
[02:11:05.734 --> 02:11:07.614]  Oh my God, I can't believe what's happened.
[02:11:08.115 --> 02:11:09.055]  Who's up next here?
[02:11:11.556 --> 02:11:14.758]  We're going to go to Zack in New York in a minute, but I'll be on Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:11:15.218 --> 02:11:15.899]  You be sure and join me.
[02:11:15.919 --> 02:11:19.501]  We're going to be giving out phone numbers, covering the latest on the amnesty bill coming up Sunday.
[02:11:19.841 --> 02:11:20.681]  Be sure and join me.
[02:11:20.721 --> 02:11:22.923]  If it's not on your local AM or FM, tell them to pick it up.
[02:11:23.583 --> 02:11:29.527]  It's up on the big Star Guide satellite, or just listen to it on KLBJ 590 here in Central Texas, from Oklahoma to Mexico border.
[02:11:30.787 --> 02:11:33.509]  Or you can listen over the internet at InfoWars.com.
[02:11:34.924 --> 02:11:36.105]  Let's go to Jack in New York.
[02:11:36.165 --> 02:11:37.066]  Jack, you're on the air.
[02:11:37.446 --> 02:11:37.846]  Hello.
[02:11:38.267 --> 02:11:40.108]  I actually have some good news for you.
[02:11:40.188 --> 02:11:45.472]  I was on the Yahoo front page and they have an AP story that's titled, Mexicans Fear U.S.
[02:11:45.532 --> 02:11:48.955]  Immigration Plans, and I wrote down the first paragraph if you'd like me to read that.
[02:11:50.196 --> 02:11:50.736]  Go ahead.
[02:11:51.757 --> 02:11:57.942]  It says, Congress's new immigration plan was bad news for tens of thousands of poor Mexicans who depend on U.S.
[02:11:57.982 --> 02:12:03.566]  guest worker programs for temporary jobs in agriculture and other seasonal work.
[02:12:04.093 --> 02:12:05.514]  Did you hear the farce of the show today?
[02:12:19.861 --> 02:12:20.401]  Exactly.
[02:12:20.542 --> 02:12:25.885]  They're being totally... See, I don't have the staff to write an article about that deception.
[02:12:26.145 --> 02:12:29.267]  We've had three senators go public and say they've seen the secret bill.
[02:12:29.768 --> 02:12:41.796]  It's basically the Kennedy bill of last year with added total amnesty under Visa Z. And then they get to bring chain migration, bring their families in, and it has the worker
[02:12:42.717 --> 02:12:46.159]  Yes, worker visa for skilled and unskilled, unlimited.
[02:12:46.659 --> 02:12:51.622]  I mean, they only give out like $300,000 for that M3 visa for the Indians to come in and take all the jobs.
[02:12:52.063 --> 02:12:54.344]  Nothing against Indians, folks, but it's destroying our economy.
[02:12:54.744 --> 02:12:59.887]  I mean, hell, now they're going to fire most of the local newspaper staff and have Indians in India writing local news.
[02:12:59.907 --> 02:13:01.288]  They just take the government press release.
[02:13:01.548 --> 02:13:02.769]  That was CNN last week.
[02:13:03.269 --> 02:13:09.795]  I mean, this is a total takeover plan, and look at the deception of Yahoo and Bush and Sean Hannity.
[02:13:09.855 --> 02:13:10.535]  I've heard him do it.
[02:13:10.815 --> 02:13:15.219]  I heard him one day for 20 minutes talk about how horrible the open borders were, how we had to have a solution.
[02:13:15.639 --> 02:13:18.261]  And I knew he was going to say, we've got to pass Bush's plan.
[02:13:18.682 --> 02:13:19.382]  And he did it!
[02:13:19.462 --> 02:13:20.623]  He is a liar!
[02:13:21.104 --> 02:13:24.907]  It's not just that they're doing it, they then lie about it, Zach!
[02:13:25.908 --> 02:13:27.429]  Well, I believe you completely.
[02:13:27.469 --> 02:13:29.851]  I have one suggestion, if I could relay that.
[02:13:30.669 --> 02:13:31.450]  Yeah, I'm going to shut up.
[02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:34.592]  I want to hear your comments on the Yahoo article, and I want to hear your suggestion.
[02:13:35.312 --> 02:13:59.789]  Uh, well, the first thing that came to mind, I have a bunch of very poor friends, and they're all encouraging me to get on food stands, which I'm resistant to, but I found myself at the, uh, basically the bread line at this church, and about 75 people standing in a row, and they're all, uh, it seemed very receptive to, uh, anything you'd like to talk about since you're waiting around hungry, and that's a good place to hit if you just want to hand out leaflets or DVDs or stand there with a sign or just talk to people, because it's a concentration of
[02:14:00.413 --> 02:14:04.517]  People who are on one level down around and receptive to information.
[02:14:04.537 --> 02:14:09.963]  As far as the Yahoo goes, I don't know.
[02:14:09.983 --> 02:14:16.850]  It kind of makes me feel good that they're having to go to such absurd lengths and have such blatant lies.
[02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:20.013]  If things are bad for us, how bad are things for them?
[02:14:21.967 --> 02:14:26.029]  Well, you're right, but a lot of people still don't realize that the lies are that big.
[02:14:26.369 --> 02:14:35.032]  They're still caught in left-right, and they don't understand that... I mean, Fox News, for a day, said that Giuliani won and had fake numbers on their website.
[02:14:35.833 --> 02:14:40.755]  I mean, it's just... It's just the lying has reached levels I can't even believe!
[02:14:41.415 --> 02:14:42.836]  Well, that's almost a good thing.
[02:14:42.876 --> 02:14:43.636]  Think about it like that.
[02:14:43.676 --> 02:14:46.237]  If you can have any solace in that in your very stressful day,
[02:14:46.827 --> 02:14:48.888]  I realize that it's just comical.
[02:14:48.968 --> 02:14:51.670]  It's like a comic book length that they're going to.
[02:14:53.111 --> 02:14:53.951]  I hear you my friend.
[02:14:53.991 --> 02:14:54.332]  Good to hear.
[02:14:54.372 --> 02:14:55.732]  Great caller call back again.
[02:14:56.213 --> 02:14:57.173]  John in Arizona.
[02:14:57.193 --> 02:14:57.754]  You're on the air.
[02:14:57.774 --> 02:14:58.154]  Go ahead.
[02:14:58.734 --> 02:14:59.255]  Hey Alex.
[02:14:59.315 --> 02:15:00.035]  Nice to talk to you.
[02:15:00.155 --> 02:15:05.298]  I heard that one caller mention about the police with the military.
[02:15:05.318 --> 02:15:12.903]  I want to say I was in Louisville, Kentucky for the Kentucky Derby Thunder air show that they had.
[02:15:13.621 --> 02:15:35.657]  It's funny because, uh, you know, we've seen military police, you know, with guns, you know, loaded, live, uh, ammo, guns, uh, patrolling the streets with the police, you know, and I was working the event, and I said, you know, I asked, I asked, uh, you know, me, uh, you know, I'm in the military myself, and I asked them, like, are you guys here, uh, you know, supporting the police, you know, helping them with, uh, you know, with law enforcement?
[02:15:36.277 --> 02:15:37.198]  And they just said yes!
[02:15:37.858 --> 02:15:41.481]  And I'm thinking, you know, man, you know, there goes your habeas corpus, and, uh,
[02:15:42.278 --> 02:15:44.222]  That's one thing I just want to... Posse Comitatus.
[02:15:44.843 --> 02:15:46.346]  Oh, I'm sorry, yes, Posse Comitatus.
[02:15:46.366 --> 02:15:47.488]  No, no, no, but it dovetails.
[02:15:47.869 --> 02:15:51.416]  Bush set up martial law under the Defense Authorization Act last year.
[02:15:52.191 --> 02:15:56.073]  It's illegal to have the military out doing it, but they're doing it everywhere, brother.
[02:15:56.554 --> 02:15:57.214]  They're moving.
[02:15:57.274 --> 02:16:00.396]  It's red dawn in slow motion.
[02:16:00.416 --> 02:16:01.336]  Do you see what's happening?
[02:16:01.977 --> 02:16:03.638]  Oh, too much, too much.
[02:16:03.678 --> 02:16:19.507]  And then another thing, just to kind of switch things around and go back to the second GOP debate, you know, there's lots of things we could say about Giuliani and all the other candidates, how, you know, they're all compromised and, you know, conflicts of interest and everything, but one thing I've heard a lot about is, you know, McCain
[02:16:20.134 --> 02:16:23.916]  Well, I made a statement saying, oh, biometrics would be a great way to fight immigration.
[02:16:23.956 --> 02:16:25.656]  You know, oh, let's have the National ID Card.
[02:16:25.957 --> 02:16:30.799]  Let's bring in the biometric information, you know, where we're all cataloged in national databases.
[02:16:30.859 --> 02:16:32.119]  And, you know, where's your freedom in that?
[02:16:32.139 --> 02:16:33.540]  I mean, and then what terrorism?
[02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:35.220]  Well, see, they also claim it's for the illegals.
[02:16:35.240 --> 02:16:36.661]  The illegals don't have to get this.
[02:16:36.921 --> 02:16:41.383]  Or under a fake name, they can get the citizenship or get the green card.
[02:16:41.723 --> 02:16:42.764]  It's disgusting.
[02:16:43.364 --> 02:16:43.584]  Right.
[02:16:44.264 --> 02:16:48.406]  And lastly, too, I mean, here we are in May of 07, you know, well, well over a year
[02:16:49.039 --> 02:16:49.479]  We're good to go.
[02:17:10.365 --> 02:17:25.985]  Uh, if we get another neocon president and leader in administration and power, it doesn't matter what truth comes out, well it will because there's going to be huge resistance, but... You know, real fast, because I got loose change guys coming up, but I want to get your take just briefly on the other side.
[02:17:26.766 --> 02:17:34.895]  Uh, what the troops were doing with their loaded guns at the Kentucky Derby, uh, what they were, were they searching bags, because I've caught them before on tape doing it.
[02:17:35.215 --> 02:17:40.361]  Again, implementing, training the public, and then people in the military, you know, are they starting to wake up.
[02:17:40.742 --> 02:17:42.203]  Then we'll talk to the loose change crew.
[02:17:42.223 --> 02:17:42.544]  Stay with us.
[02:17:48.286 --> 02:17:50.248]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer.
[02:17:50.728 --> 02:17:53.391]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[02:17:54.171 --> 02:17:55.292]  For a while, anyway.
[02:17:55.813 --> 02:17:58.976]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[02:17:59.596 --> 02:18:01.918]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[02:18:02.238 --> 02:18:05.721]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[02:18:06.102 --> 02:18:08.344]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[02:18:08.904 --> 02:18:09.625]  What's the name again?
[02:18:10.005 --> 02:18:11.006]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[02:18:11.386 --> 02:18:12.207]  It's CalX.
[02:18:12.507 --> 02:18:12.728]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[02:18:15.063 --> 02:18:16.724]  What makes Cal-X ointment so different?
[02:18:16.924 --> 02:18:25.267]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[02:18:26.288 --> 02:18:30.850]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[02:18:31.070 --> 02:18:40.173]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[02:18:40.874 --> 02:18:41.994]  Hey, there's a drug store.
[02:18:42.034 --> 02:18:42.714]  I'll be right back.
[02:18:42.955 --> 02:18:43.895]  I'm getting some Cal-X.
[02:18:47.012 --> 02:18:50.857]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[02:18:50.897 --> 02:18:52.158]  dollar has been devaluating.
[02:18:52.318 --> 02:18:55.882]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:18:56.183 --> 02:18:58.706]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[02:18:59.106 --> 02:19:00.868]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:19:01.188 --> 02:19:03.511]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:19:04.532 --> 02:19:08.255]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:19:08.295 --> 02:19:10.156]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[02:19:20.203 --> 02:19:22.103]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[02:19:22.304 --> 02:19:24.764]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:19:24.844 --> 02:19:27.825]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[02:19:27.845 --> 02:19:28.525]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:19:28.565 --> 02:19:31.266]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[02:19:31.286 --> 02:19:31.946]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:19:46.295 --> 02:19:49.477]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:19:49.497 --> 02:19:53.538]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:19:53.678 --> 02:19:56.240]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:58.641]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:19:58.821 --> 02:20:07.265]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:20:07.325 --> 02:20:08.645]  The brookie light is different.
[02:20:08.785 --> 02:20:12.807]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:20:12.807 --> 02:20:13.287]  We're good to go!
[02:20:33.300 --> 02:20:37.884]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:20:37.904 --> 02:20:38.844]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:46.603 --> 02:20:47.745]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD.
[02:20:47.765 --> 02:20:50.167]  I'm the Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis.
[02:20:50.287 --> 02:20:53.271]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[02:20:53.331 --> 02:20:53.991]  is a real thing.
[02:20:54.092 --> 02:21:00.979]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer from fresh, never before available garlic.
[02:21:01.099 --> 02:21:06.365]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[02:21:06.525 --> 02:21:07.265]  We're good to go!
[02:21:33.351 --> 02:21:36.813]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[02:21:36.873 --> 02:21:37.353]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[02:21:37.373 --> 02:21:39.154]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[02:22:04.808 --> 02:22:05.248]  Yeah!
[02:22:05.529 --> 02:22:06.609]  We're taking action!
[02:22:06.649 --> 02:22:08.790]  We're not backing down, we're committed!
[02:22:10.271 --> 02:22:10.792]  Head up!
[02:22:12.653 --> 02:22:13.273]  We're going in!
[02:22:13.293 --> 02:22:21.177]  Alright, real fast, let's go back to
[02:22:35.367 --> 02:22:36.288]  John in Arizona.
[02:22:37.029 --> 02:22:38.110]  He was out of the Kentucky Derby.
[02:22:38.130 --> 02:22:40.332]  He's in the military and he saw troops with guns running around.
[02:22:40.573 --> 02:22:45.358]  I know that was even on the news, but they even go to small town football games now and search the children.
[02:22:45.638 --> 02:22:51.344]  They make a point of it, and they admit it's acclimating the public to the new homeland security system.
[02:22:51.784 --> 02:22:55.308]  When you talk to the troops, do they seem to not like what they were doing, or were they brainwashed?
[02:22:55.348 --> 02:22:58.091]  And then when you talk to the military, because you're still in, what do they say?
[02:22:58.669 --> 02:22:59.110]  Right.
[02:22:59.210 --> 02:23:02.134]  Well, Alex, actually, surprisingly, they weren't brainwashed.
[02:23:02.154 --> 02:23:04.297]  I asked them where they were from.
[02:23:04.337 --> 02:23:06.539]  They were from Indiana, someone I can't remember exactly.
[02:23:07.020 --> 02:23:09.984]  But they were part of the Army National Guard up there.
[02:23:10.465 --> 02:23:13.288]  And they said, you know, they said it's such a waste of time for them to be down there.
[02:23:13.308 --> 02:23:14.470]  They are very unhappy.
[02:23:14.490 --> 02:23:15.712]  You know, they've been down there all day.
[02:23:16.371 --> 02:23:16.471]  It's
[02:23:40.055 --> 02:23:41.756]  They do it at highly visible events.
[02:23:41.776 --> 02:23:42.816]  That is the brass does.
[02:23:43.376 --> 02:23:51.060]  Homeland Security head Ridge said two years ago on Fox they're doing it to prepare us to merge with the feds.
[02:23:51.520 --> 02:23:53.901]  And let me expand, why aren't they on the border?
[02:23:54.521 --> 02:23:56.442]  You see, no, no, they're at the Kentucky Derby.
[02:23:56.742 --> 02:23:58.302]  Well listen, God bless you, good to hear from you.
[02:23:59.123 --> 02:24:00.603]  Be sure and call me back with more reports.
[02:24:01.224 --> 02:24:04.365]  Alright, Dylan Avery, Corin Rowe, Jason Burmas, good friends of mine.
[02:24:05.838 --> 02:24:08.879]  I, a year and a half ago, got a chance to get to know Charlie Sheen.
[02:24:08.919 --> 02:24:10.959]  A few months after I talked to him, he came on the air.
[02:24:12.339 --> 02:24:15.700]  Charlie and I were talking about trying to make a full-length movie, and I recommended it.
[02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:18.601]  He said, you ought to just redo Loose Change, because I know they're going to do a new version.
[02:24:19.221 --> 02:24:23.102]  They came to the Symposium in June of last year, now almost a year ago.
[02:24:23.122 --> 02:24:25.082]  What was it, June 15th?
[02:24:25.422 --> 02:24:26.342]  They met Charlie.
[02:24:27.562 --> 02:24:29.903]  Charlie was a big fan of the film, one of the things that woke him up.
[02:24:30.660 --> 02:24:34.106]  And then, uh, they've been busy getting it ready, preparing it, writing the script.
[02:24:34.126 --> 02:24:36.910]  I mean, this is a perf- uh, Loose Change 2 is great.
[02:24:36.950 --> 02:24:37.732]  This is incredible.
[02:24:38.525 --> 02:24:43.546]  And here to break it down for you and give you more details is the Loose Change crew.
[02:24:43.566 --> 02:24:44.467]  Why is this important?
[02:24:44.487 --> 02:24:48.528]  I'm going to recap Ron Paul, I'm going to recap the border stuff, give out the phone numbers before we leave.
[02:24:48.928 --> 02:24:56.310]  But we're covering this right now because 9-11 is the foundation of their police state, their foreign wars, their domestic crackdown on freedom.
[02:24:56.950 --> 02:24:59.190]  And yes, I am the executive producer on this.
[02:24:59.550 --> 02:25:00.851]  With the guys, I am honored.
[02:25:00.871 --> 02:25:04.072]  And here to talk about it is the Loose Change crew.
[02:25:04.432 --> 02:25:05.392]  Gentlemen, thanks for coming on.
[02:25:06.226 --> 02:25:07.407]  Well, thanks for having us, Alex.
[02:25:07.427 --> 02:25:08.329]  We're stoked to be on it.
[02:25:08.349 --> 02:25:09.550]  We're stoked to be working with you.
[02:25:10.131 --> 02:25:11.973]  And that, of course, is Burmese.
[02:25:13.955 --> 02:25:14.296]  It is.
[02:25:14.416 --> 02:25:15.577]  Dylan, why don't you say something?
[02:25:16.278 --> 02:25:19.042]  Hey, what's up to all you millions of listeners out there?
[02:25:19.062 --> 02:25:20.924]  It's good to be back on the Alex Jones Show again.
[02:25:21.852 --> 02:25:23.173]  Hey there Commander, it's Corey.
[02:25:23.253 --> 02:25:23.553]  What up?
[02:25:24.133 --> 02:25:27.596]  And then we've got Corey back from the wars on the team.
[02:25:28.096 --> 02:25:29.377]  I tell you, what a story.
[02:25:29.737 --> 02:25:31.678]  Guys, why did you want to get me involved in the project?
[02:25:31.698 --> 02:25:34.720]  You could have gotten a little bit of financing that you didn't really need from anywhere.
[02:25:34.980 --> 02:25:35.961]  I'm just honored to be included.
[02:25:36.401 --> 02:25:46.027]  Well Alex, with your audience and the way that you have established yourself and the way that you can help us distribute and get the word out, I mean, it's really just a good merger.
[02:25:46.067 --> 02:25:47.688]  I mean, it's between you and us.
[02:25:47.748 --> 02:25:50.690]  We reach a lot of different people and together we can reach even more.
[02:25:51.150 --> 02:25:54.491]  And you know, we have a youth executive producer.
[02:25:54.511 --> 02:25:57.572]  We have David Ray Griffin, who's going to be our fact checker and script consultant.
[02:25:58.112 --> 02:25:59.492]  Charlie Sheen's going to be involved.
[02:26:00.172 --> 02:26:01.553]  We've got a really good team.
[02:26:01.573 --> 02:26:08.974]  We've got everyone together and we're going to produce this film and get it out to as many people as possible because that's what we started for and that's what we're going to continue to do.
[02:26:08.994 --> 02:26:18.337]  One of the main reasons that we love having you involved, Alex, is that you're going to let us do our own thing and there's no way that our film is going to be censored in any shape or form.
[02:26:19.537 --> 02:26:20.938]  You're a bulldog out there, Alex.
[02:26:20.958 --> 02:26:22.278]  You're never going to let that happen.
[02:26:22.399 --> 02:26:26.421]  And this is going to reach such an audience, and we're hoping that this is finally going to be the tipping point.
[02:26:26.641 --> 02:26:37.266]  Because as we've said before, if we can make this the number one movie in America, and we've made, you know, Ron Paul the number one candidate in America, we can make this the number one issue in America, and we can have a true independent investigation.
[02:26:38.480 --> 02:26:42.982]  Absolutely, and in the words of Burmess, we're talking about Voltron here.
[02:26:43.002 --> 02:26:50.664]  For those that don't know, that's the Chinese-Japanimation show where all different pieces form to make the big juggernaut to crush the New World Order.
[02:26:51.724 --> 02:26:55.886]  Absolutely, and we work with such great people on so many different levels.
[02:26:56.306 --> 02:27:00.247]  Like Corey stated before, David Ray Griffin has really vetted the script and fact-checked
[02:27:00.655 --> 02:27:03.557]  And it's been a great experience, you know, not only working with him, but working with you.
[02:27:03.618 --> 02:27:12.505]  I mean, I gotta tell you, Alex, Road to Tyranny was one of my big wake-up calls, and to be actually involved in a project, in a film project, with Alex Jones is a big deal for us.
[02:27:13.820 --> 02:27:17.283]  Well, it's a big deal for me to be involved with the biggest internet movie.
[02:27:17.443 --> 02:27:19.845]  Over 100 million downloads now total globally.
[02:27:20.105 --> 02:27:22.147]  They keep using the number from a year ago of 30 million.
[02:27:22.467 --> 02:27:26.630]  Try over 100 million and be working with you men is really exciting.
[02:27:26.830 --> 02:27:34.316]  We're going to come back and talk a little bit more about it, take some calls on a host of issues, and move forward in our war against the New World Order.
[02:27:36.758 --> 02:27:37.698]  We're on the march.
[02:27:38.139 --> 02:27:39.760]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.681 --> 02:27:43.343]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.756 --> 02:27:50.360]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?

[02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.350]  I'm good.
[02:28:47.538 --> 02:28:48.779]  This is Elizabeth Border.
[02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:50.000]  News alert!
[02:28:50.501 --> 02:28:54.725]  Twice a month you can now get the Divided Kingdom's brand new newsletter.
[02:28:55.165 --> 02:28:55.746]  Concise?
[02:28:56.026 --> 02:28:56.646]  Hard-hitting?
[02:28:57.007 --> 02:28:59.929]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[02:29:00.290 --> 02:29:01.471]  War in Iran?
[02:29:01.491 --> 02:29:03.653]  A coming One World Church?
[02:29:04.413 --> 02:29:09.697]  In the first issue is included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.
[02:29:10.237 --> 02:29:17.661]  For a free sample copy of the Divided Kingdom dossier, write to Post Office Box 8, Bethlehem, Maryland, 21609.

[02:29:46.326 --> 02:29:50.830]  Summer is once again just around the corner, and as usual, so are higher gas prices.
[02:29:51.270 --> 02:29:54.453]  This year, stop taking it on the chin and start fighting back.
[02:29:54.893 --> 02:30:02.960]  Ethos FR, a product tested and found worthy by NBC and Fox News, can save you up to 19% on fuel and reduce emissions by up to 30%.
[02:30:03.921 --> 02:30:06.203]  Unlike other products and gadgets you've seen advertised,
[02:30:06.683 --> 02:30:10.487]  Ethos FR attacks the source of the problem, unburned fuel.
[02:30:10.927 --> 02:30:14.671]  You see, exhaust is essentially unburned fuel that's expelled from your tailpipe.
[02:30:15.131 --> 02:30:19.975]  That equates to toxins being released into the environment and dollars being released from your wallet.
[02:30:20.376 --> 02:30:26.962]  But with Ethos FR, fuel burns more completely, helping your engine to deliver better mileage and helping you to save money.
[02:30:27.582 --> 02:30:29.243]  And, it's so easy to use.
[02:30:29.623 --> 02:30:35.606]  Simply pour a couple of ounces into your tank at every fill up, and you're on your way to saving money and the environment.

[02:30:46.337 --> 02:31:02.918]  Way up north to Alaska Way up north to Alaska North to Alaska Go north for Russia's home North to Alaska Go north for Russia's home
[02:31:03.859 --> 02:31:20.105]  Big Sam left Seattle in the year of 92 With George Pratt, his partner, and brother Billy, too They crossed the Yukon River and found the Bonanza Gold
[02:31:20.965 --> 02:31:31.510]  Below that old white mountain, just a little southeast of Nome, Sam crossed the majestic mountains to the valleys far below.
[02:31:32.331 --> 02:31:42.856]  He talked to his team of huskies as he mushed on through the snow, with the northern lights a-runnin' wild in the land of the midnight sun.
[02:31:49.558 --> 02:31:56.519]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:57.220 --> 02:32:10.323]  And I'll tell you right now, you talk about trailblazers, Lewis and Clark, you talk about those that found the bonanza up in Alaska, the Texians at the Alamo, all the people that have trailblazed and done dangerous things.
[02:32:11.110 --> 02:32:18.233]  What a great example of Dylan Avery who was what, 22 years old, 21, when he first made the first cut of Loose Change two and a half, three years ago.
[02:32:18.914 --> 02:32:30.039]  What a journey it's been now with the final cut, which is, again, professional script, vetting, fact-checking, literally hundreds of interviews, so much research traveling all over the place.
[02:32:30.877 --> 02:32:33.479]  And I'm just glad to be able to be supportive in all of that.
[02:32:33.659 --> 02:32:40.184]  Let's continue with that and then get some into the view that's scheduled coming up, what, next week.
[02:32:41.064 --> 02:32:48.529]  But before we do that, gentlemen, let's finish up getting into loose change final cut.
[02:32:49.630 --> 02:32:53.313]  I mean, obviously things are fluid right now because you're finishing it up and different deals are going to be made.
[02:32:56.333 --> 02:32:58.374]  In the next few months, we'll have more information for people.
[02:32:58.434 --> 02:33:05.859]  We're talking fall or winter, theatrical, we're talking about being able to see it in Europe and in the United States.
[02:33:06.279 --> 02:33:12.584]  Everything's fluid right now, but folks are going to get to see loose change, final cut very, very soon.
[02:33:12.624 --> 02:33:14.265]  Things are now getting more concrete, aren't they?
[02:33:15.086 --> 02:33:22.672]  Absolutely, and one of the great things about this movie is there's footage in it that I haven't seen up until a week ago that we're still ordering.
[02:33:23.272 --> 02:33:29.256]  And it's really, not only the 9-11 Truth Committee, but the community, but the world in general has just not seen this stuff.
[02:33:29.517 --> 02:33:29.937]  Exactly.
[02:33:29.977 --> 02:33:34.340]  We've got the Department of Defense footage that was shot in the aftermath of the Pentagon attack.
[02:33:34.360 --> 02:33:35.761]  We've got footage inside the Pentagon.
[02:33:36.262 --> 02:33:38.483]  We've got so much here, Alex.
[02:33:38.523 --> 02:33:39.584]  It's really mind-blowing.
[02:33:40.046 --> 02:33:44.591]  And to be honest with you, we're doing things the same way we always have.
[02:33:44.611 --> 02:33:47.193]  We've just found alternative venues of gathering footage.
[02:33:47.794 --> 02:33:49.836]  Anybody could be making the film that we're making right now.
[02:33:49.976 --> 02:33:54.480]  Yeah, and the funny thing is, I mean, Dylan Avery is sitting to the right of me, editing as we speak.
[02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:57.283]  I mean, that's how feverishly we're working to get this...
[02:33:57.663 --> 02:33:58.284]  This movie out.
[02:33:58.304 --> 02:34:02.566]  So you can see Ken Holden before the 9-11 Commission talking about the molten metal.
[02:34:02.827 --> 02:34:07.530]  So you can see Norman Mineta not once but twice actually talking about Dick Cheney's stand-down order.
[02:34:07.730 --> 02:34:09.191]  We have footage nobody's ever seen.
[02:34:09.431 --> 02:34:17.236]  You can see Duffy and Nash talking about how they were going at supersonic speeds, yet the official version now clocks them at something like 455 miles per hour.
[02:34:17.677 --> 02:34:25.682]  I mean, there's just so much out there, Alex, and we're just putting it together into another ball of fire that's going to light this movement up and hopefully get something done.
[02:34:27.404 --> 02:34:29.825]  Well, the movement has already gone nuclear.
[02:34:29.865 --> 02:34:31.326]  It's just going to go supernova.
[02:34:31.506 --> 02:34:33.007]  I mean, you talk about light it up.
[02:34:33.087 --> 02:34:35.348]  It's burning like a trillion stars right now.
[02:34:35.788 --> 02:34:39.871]  But this is going to be like just adding antimatter to the equation.
[02:34:40.251 --> 02:34:48.935]  It's going to be a fabric of propaganda ripping event where we're going to tear back some of the final veils and bring these enemies to justice.
[02:34:49.316 --> 02:34:52.837]  I mean, the loose change, second cut has been an international phenomenon.
[02:34:53.198 --> 02:34:55.619]  The first and still biggest internet hit ever.
[02:34:56.099 --> 02:35:02.963]  Bigger than ever, growing faster than ever, and it's such a testament to what individuals can do when they join forces.
[02:35:03.463 --> 02:35:07.425]  It's just so wonderful to be involved in something this historical, gentlemen.
[02:35:07.445 --> 02:35:10.586]  So again, I thank you for inviting me into the project.
[02:35:11.847 --> 02:35:13.768]  And again, Alex, we're just glad to have you here, man.
[02:35:13.788 --> 02:35:17.610]  Again, we're going to reach as many people as possible, and us together, we can just reach that many more.
[02:35:18.485 --> 02:35:19.106]  Absolutely.
[02:35:19.166 --> 02:35:23.430]  Now, let's get into The View and talk a little bit about that.
[02:35:24.391 --> 02:35:26.273]  Willie Rodriguez is going to be on there.
[02:35:27.114 --> 02:35:28.275]  Other people are going to be on there.
[02:35:28.935 --> 02:35:37.784]  We didn't want to talk about it because we didn't want to let the producers and other people get a lot of heat and the neocons boycott it and try to block it, but ABC put a press release out last week.
[02:35:38.144 --> 02:35:42.769]  That may be a neocon trying to get attention so Fox News will attack and still try to ban it.
[02:35:43.389 --> 02:35:45.670]  But looks like you guys will be on next Thursday?
[02:35:46.390 --> 02:35:49.892]  No, actually the day has changed a couple times and they're telling us to be flexible.
[02:35:50.232 --> 02:35:55.334]  The good news is originally we were going to be on, we were going to be on the fifth segment of the show for a few minutes.
[02:35:55.814 --> 02:35:57.194]  Looks like the segment is getting bigger.
[02:35:57.455 --> 02:35:59.936]  They just want to make sure that they got all the planning and everything right.
[02:35:59.956 --> 02:36:03.577]  So it might get pushed back a week, but at the same time we're full green light.
[02:36:04.498 --> 02:36:07.541]  And again, the segment that we're going to be doing is actually getting larger.
[02:36:07.561 --> 02:36:13.989]  Why do you think ABC... Why do you think ABC... There'll be no other opposition towards us.
[02:36:14.309 --> 02:36:19.616]  They gave Popular Mechanics the chance to again debate us, yet they've declined on several occasions now.
[02:36:19.656 --> 02:36:21.618]  Yeah, Popular Mechanics did decline to debate us.
[02:36:21.758 --> 02:36:28.920]  Yeah, I mean, that's the first thing they tried to set up, and Popular Mechanics is no longer doing these type of debates because they get owned on every single one of them.
[02:36:29.300 --> 02:36:29.480]  Owned.
[02:36:29.720 --> 02:36:41.983]  And, uh, you know, I just wish that these guys could actually, they could face us again, Alex, but I think that they finally see that they only have a veil of lies and irrelevant attacks, really, trying to equate us with things like anti-Semitism and Area 51.
[02:36:42.384 --> 02:36:43.824]  And back to the facts.
[02:36:44.104 --> 02:36:46.605]  Molten Metal was found under World Trade Center 1, 2, and 7.
[02:36:47.925 --> 02:36:51.608]  And now you have one of the guys at NIST, John Gross, denying its very existence.
[02:36:51.868 --> 02:36:55.090]  Their lives are running thin, and they're not going to be running for much longer.
[02:36:56.872 --> 02:37:03.256]  Absolutely, and we've got that great footage here in Austin because of the PNAC crew doing a fabulous job.
[02:37:03.337 --> 02:37:06.739]  It's a project for an American citizen doing so much good here locally.
[02:37:09.119 --> 02:37:16.142]  To be specific here, see, because when I knew about this two or three weeks ago, I knew they were going to get Palmer Mechanics, get you guys, get Rodriguez.
[02:37:16.542 --> 02:37:25.126]  I'd even heard they were going to call you before you guys even called me and told me about it, but I wasn't sure, because I have sources inside, you know, good friends of O'Donnell, and I've gotten a few communiques.
[02:37:26.047 --> 02:37:30.989]  But, yeah, I knew that they were first going to try to have them on with you, but they refused that.
[02:37:31.249 --> 02:37:32.750]  Then I heard they were going to have their own segment.
[02:37:33.070 --> 02:37:35.271]  Now they're afraid to even come on by themselves?
[02:37:35.571 --> 02:37:37.112]  I mean, that shows what pathetic
[02:37:37.712 --> 02:37:46.461]  Well, I think that they're going to get their own day, you know, no opposition at all, and they're going to be with Elizabeth Hasselbeck only.
[02:37:46.581 --> 02:37:49.324]  I don't think that they're going to let Rosie take on the Popular Mechanics crew.
[02:37:49.444 --> 02:37:53.188]  Yeah, and also I just want to point out real quick that I don't think it's just going to be us on there.
[02:37:53.208 --> 02:37:56.151]  They're going to have Willie, I think they're even working on having Stephen Jones there.
[02:37:56.491 --> 02:37:59.434]  So it's not like they're bringing us on as the figureheads of the movement.
[02:38:00.084 --> 02:38:01.907]  They just called us and wanted us on.
[02:38:01.927 --> 02:38:11.920]  And we just hope that, you know, this reaches more people and as soon as people get done seeing us on The View, they immediately go to their computers, they go to loosechange911.com and on our cover page you can watch it for free.
[02:38:11.940 --> 02:38:14.003]  We just want to open that many more minds, Alex.
[02:38:14.383 --> 02:38:14.784]  Absolutely.
[02:38:14.804 --> 02:38:26.587]  Absolutely, and the day you go on I'll put a huge link on Prison Planet right at the top so people can also go there and see it because it's an easy to remember domain name so they don't go off to the screw loose change people and all their Pentagon operations.
[02:38:27.347 --> 02:38:32.348]  But yeah, that's what I was told is that they were afraid to debate you so they went ahead and just changed it to their own day.
[02:38:32.368 --> 02:38:37.449]  So I'm glad to hear that the name in yellow journalism will still get to spew their lies.
[02:38:37.969 --> 02:38:41.970]  I mean, just talk about some of the lies that Popular Mechanics has put out, guys.
[02:38:43.166 --> 02:38:46.007]  Well, I mean, actually, I'd like to butt in real quick.
[02:38:46.507 --> 02:38:55.751]  I will not really butt in, but I was actually going back through our debate with Popular Mechanics, and I think there's a very glaring example of the tactics that people like Popular Mechanics employ.
[02:38:56.851 --> 02:39:08.015]  Amy Goodman played the eyewitness montage where there's all these people talking about secondary explosions, Pat Dawson talking about Albert Turi, the chief of the FDNY saying he thought secondary devices were involved.
[02:39:08.335 --> 02:39:12.417]  This three-minute montage of eyewitnesses saying there were bombs inside the building.
[02:39:12.819 --> 02:39:14.300]  What does James Miggs respond to?
[02:39:14.580 --> 02:39:19.083]  He says, well a lot of that testimony is based around a story of a man named Kevin Ryan.
[02:39:19.323 --> 02:39:41.017]  They totally ducked the issue and resorted to one of their top... And by the way, Kevin Ryan came out three years later because he was working over a whole division of underwriting laboratories and saw their own internal year-long study and report with live models saying it was impossible, so they just ignored that day's eyewitness video reports and just say Kevin Ryan and lie!
[02:39:41.557 --> 02:39:42.098]  Exactly.
[02:39:42.498 --> 02:39:46.340]  It's a perfect example of how they misdirect and change the issue when they have nothing.
[02:39:46.701 --> 02:39:52.885]  Yeah, and another thing I'd like to point out is that they actually had the nerve to say that Underwriters Laboratory doesn't test structural skill.
[02:39:52.985 --> 02:39:56.147]  You can go to the Wikipedia page right now and they've debunked that.
[02:39:56.167 --> 02:40:05.954]  They're like, well, although some of the other debates in the loose change problem of mechanics are still up for debate, there is no debating that Underwriters Laboratory tests and certifies structural
[02:40:06.534 --> 02:40:09.538]  Well, I also want to be clear on something else.
[02:40:10.378 --> 02:40:13.402]  Let's pause for a minute going after Popular Mechanics and just go back to something else.
[02:40:13.902 --> 02:40:18.147]  I've gotten a few emails, I've seen some message boards that I monitor for really news tips.
[02:40:19.549 --> 02:40:19.829]  I don't
[02:40:45.543 --> 02:40:45.883]  I don't know.
[02:41:05.995 --> 02:41:14.982]  It's a great weight, and it's also dangerous to be in the position you're in, and the movement needs to stop squawking about who needs to be our leaders and just take action against the New World Order.
[02:41:15.242 --> 02:41:18.825]  I want to hear less about organization and more about attacking the enemy.
[02:41:19.025 --> 02:41:25.570]  We are in a hand-to-hand, last-ditch trench warfare combat with bayonets here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:25.770 --> 02:41:31.194]  We don't have time for the liberals to blow a whistle and go, now everyone listen, we've got to do this in an orderly way.
[02:41:31.474 --> 02:41:32.334]  We're the leaders.
[02:41:32.734 --> 02:41:33.054]  No!
[02:41:33.375 --> 02:41:35.495]  We don't wait for orders from headquarters!
[02:41:35.755 --> 02:41:37.456]  We go to the sound of the guns!
[02:41:37.776 --> 02:41:39.076]  Min, you want to comment on that?
[02:41:39.576 --> 02:41:40.517]  Well, absolutely, Alex.
[02:41:40.557 --> 02:41:41.057]  That's the thing.
[02:41:41.097 --> 02:41:45.178]  We're just three guys putting out a motion picture that a lot of people have related to.
[02:41:45.558 --> 02:41:49.839]  And we feel blessed that we've been able to reach so many people with our message.
[02:41:49.859 --> 02:41:52.320]  We've never said that we want to be at the head of this movement.
[02:41:52.839 --> 02:42:00.163]  That everything we say is gospel, we say, check it out for yourselves and come to your own conclusions and please just look at our information.
[02:42:00.384 --> 02:42:07.088]  If people want to put us as the figureheads or, you know, Mossad operatives or spoiled punks, that's their problem.
[02:42:07.308 --> 02:42:15.433]  You know, we're just going to keep going forward and doing what we're doing because we know we not only are reaching, you know, thousands and millions of young people, we're reaching an older crowd too.
[02:42:15.773 --> 02:42:17.474]  So we're just going to keep trenching on, Alex.
[02:42:19.382 --> 02:42:21.845]  Well, I'm not even talking about this info folks attacking you.
[02:42:21.865 --> 02:42:22.905]  I mean, that's to be expected.
[02:42:22.925 --> 02:42:28.470]  You've got basically the Pentagon coming after you with Fox News and popular Hearst Publishing propaganda channel.
[02:42:28.991 --> 02:42:33.535]  But I mean, I'm just talking about our own movement needs to worry less about ninnying and more about getting the info out.
[02:42:34.389 --> 02:42:34.870]  Well, I agree.
[02:42:34.890 --> 02:42:36.011]  I mean, that's what I'm talking about.
[02:42:36.151 --> 02:42:40.495]  On some of these boards, you'll hear everything that we're funded by the Simon family.
[02:42:40.575 --> 02:42:44.979]  Or that we're intentional COINTELPRO because we endorse a certain theory.
[02:42:45.099 --> 02:42:46.180]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:42:46.500 --> 02:42:48.061]  I mean, no one here is perfect.
[02:42:48.101 --> 02:42:49.242]  We're human beings, Alex.
[02:42:49.302 --> 02:42:49.943]  Look, look, look.
[02:42:50.023 --> 02:42:52.685]  It's government agents trying to diffuse the movement.
[02:42:52.726 --> 02:42:53.406]  It's not working.
[02:42:53.626 --> 02:42:56.929]  That's why I raise this contentious point so we can nip it in the bud right now.
[02:42:56.969 --> 02:42:58.531]  Corey, you want to comment on this?
[02:42:59.976 --> 02:43:03.078]  You know Matt, the haters are always going to be there.
[02:43:03.478 --> 02:43:06.399]  I actually, I've always endorsed people like Screw Loose Change.
[02:43:06.540 --> 02:43:09.581]  I think that they actually bring more controversy to the subject.
[02:43:10.101 --> 02:43:14.484]  And in numerous, every interview I bring them up and I say, you know, at least I'm giving someone a job.
[02:43:14.924 --> 02:43:19.046]  And they're able to actually bring people to the side of their argument that don't believe us.
[02:43:19.366 --> 02:43:20.747]  And then once those people actively
[02:43:21.247 --> 02:43:21.828]  We're good to go.
[02:43:41.099 --> 02:43:41.659]  Rod Paul.
[02:43:42.219 --> 02:43:46.600]  He wins the first debate in all the major polls, so they all savage him and basically bushwhacking.
[02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:50.581]  Every candidate attacks him, every pundit attacks him, every question is an attack.
[02:43:50.721 --> 02:43:52.622]  Everybody saw what it was, a lynching.
[02:43:53.042 --> 02:43:54.102]  It blew up in their face.
[02:43:54.142 --> 02:43:55.362]  He clearly won that debate.
[02:43:55.702 --> 02:43:56.862]  Now they're trying to ban him.
[02:43:56.903 --> 02:43:58.083]  That makes him only bigger.
[02:43:58.343 --> 02:44:00.863]  Now they're talking about him from CNN to ABC.
[02:44:01.283 --> 02:44:02.584]  And again, yes!
[02:44:02.724 --> 02:44:08.085]  Why do you think the government operatives, and a lot of them are, cannot figure out that attacking us doesn't work?
[02:44:09.182 --> 02:44:12.243]  I mean, actually, we are redoing the way things are done.
[02:44:12.263 --> 02:44:15.224]  The way the information gets out, we are recreating that every day.
[02:44:15.565 --> 02:44:19.346]  You, us, all the independent websites, I mean, we are becoming the media.
[02:44:19.646 --> 02:44:27.349]  Mainstream news sales are down, ratings are down, and people are actively going to the information and they're actively looking for it themselves.
[02:44:27.729 --> 02:44:28.830]  And through that, you know,
[02:44:29.528 --> 02:44:30.349]  I kind of lost my point.
[02:44:30.609 --> 02:44:31.810]  Well, I want to say this, Alex.
[02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:33.051]  No, that was a great point.
[02:44:33.071 --> 02:44:33.851]  That was a great point.
[02:44:33.932 --> 02:44:35.473]  Go ahead.
[02:44:35.633 --> 02:44:41.017]  In 2004, when we were watching, you know, the debates there, we didn't have one candidate that was talking about any real issues.
[02:44:41.057 --> 02:44:43.439]  The closest we had was maybe Dennis Kucinich.
[02:44:43.919 --> 02:44:51.425]  And people would have laughed in your and my face if we said that the alternative media could get a lead candidate in the next presidential election.
[02:44:51.465 --> 02:44:52.606]  And that's exactly what we've done.
[02:44:52.806 --> 02:44:55.889]  The alternative media and your website have exploded so much.
[02:44:56.425 --> 02:45:01.648]  That Ron Paul is now the leader in every single major poll of every debate he's taken part in.
[02:45:02.008 --> 02:45:12.094]  And on top of that, the man got on national television and actually said in the first week of office he would disband the IRS in the second week, he would work to get rid of the Federal Reserve System.
[02:45:12.454 --> 02:45:19.398]  Now if the average American actually knew that, if that was on the front page of the New York Times or the Washington Post, he would have 90% of the vote.
[02:45:19.658 --> 02:45:22.400]  How many people want to pay a federal income tax that is totally illegal?
[02:45:23.823 --> 02:45:25.405]  I totally agree, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:45:25.685 --> 02:45:27.307]  We are seeing a chance.
[02:45:27.367 --> 02:45:30.490]  We're seeing that we can gain ground, that we can win.
[02:45:30.870 --> 02:45:34.374]  And in any war, you've got to, number one, folks, realize you can win.
[02:45:34.694 --> 02:45:36.036]  It's whoever's got the initiative.
[02:45:36.056 --> 02:45:46.967]  Corey, how important in a combat situation and in an info war is knowing that you're in the right and having the initiative and having the moral courage to literally commit to something?
[02:45:47.527 --> 02:45:50.349]  I mean, that's what gives you the morale in the situation to see it through.
[02:45:50.409 --> 02:45:59.416]  I mean, when you know what's going on and you have a full picture, and you know what you're doing is right, it just gives you that much more motivation, that much more energy, and that much more dedication to the cause, and that's sort of what we got.
[02:46:01.037 --> 02:46:05.701]  And I want all the spooks listening right now, you can still join us, you can still turn away from what you're doing.
[02:46:06.281 --> 02:46:09.624]  I mean, I marvel at how people can continue to serve this evil, gentlemen.
[02:46:10.183 --> 02:46:22.140]  Well, I do too, and actually I'm going to go ahead and plug David's book real quick because it just came out, Debunking 9-11 Debunkers, which goes after Popular Mechanics and how they came out with the debunking 9-11 myth and so what.
[02:46:22.380 --> 02:46:23.261]  This book just came out.
[02:46:23.301 --> 02:46:24.262]  It's available on Amazon.
[02:46:24.303 --> 02:46:24.383]  It's $13.
[02:46:25.544 --> 02:46:26.605]  And it's an amazing read.
[02:46:26.625 --> 02:46:28.666]  It's got some really great information in there.
[02:46:28.746 --> 02:46:34.609]  And for all the spooks who are out there listening here, you're holding on to those beliefs that fire melted steel.
[02:46:34.889 --> 02:46:35.910]  Go out, pick up the book.
[02:46:36.290 --> 02:46:37.711]  I mean, I'll send you one if you need it.
[02:46:38.151 --> 02:46:40.392]  And read it through and debunk yourself.
[02:46:40.712 --> 02:46:46.976]  And on top of that, I'd just like to say, some of their other tactics are that they'll make outlandish claims that are open-ended.
[02:46:47.396 --> 02:46:48.717]  Such as World Trade Center Building 7.
[02:46:49.418 --> 02:46:55.562]  Obviously the South Face has damage to it, but they'll say something like, up to 25% of the building was scooped out.
[02:46:55.622 --> 02:47:01.947]  Yeah, for 25% of World Trade Center Building 7 to have been scooped out, technically the entire South Face would have had to have been sheared off.
[02:47:02.027 --> 02:47:07.471]  And then in their rebuttal to Rosie this week, they actually said that steel begins to weaken at 400 degrees.
[02:47:07.691 --> 02:47:11.674]  Now this may be true, but it probably retains 99.9% of its... No, no, no, no, no.
[02:47:11.694 --> 02:47:12.235]  They said 250.
[02:47:15.447 --> 02:47:17.430]  Well no, Hasselbeck said 250.
[02:47:17.931 --> 02:47:20.355]  And then Popular Mechanics actually wrote something up.
[02:47:20.856 --> 02:47:21.236]  And they said 400.
[02:47:24.286 --> 02:47:24.807]  It's unbelievable.
[02:47:24.827 --> 02:47:29.912]  But if we get 400 degrees, that wouldn't come close to making the building unstable in any way, shape, or form.
[02:47:30.152 --> 02:47:34.757]  We know the firefighters were in the impact zone prior to the building collapsing in on itself.
[02:47:34.797 --> 02:47:45.889]  They said that they could knock it down with two lines, and five minutes later it miraculously collapses into its own footprint symmetrically, dispersing pulverized concrete and steel beams everywhere.
[02:47:46.565 --> 02:47:49.186]  Loosechange911.com is the website.
[02:47:49.226 --> 02:47:50.147]  It's all over the place.
[02:47:50.507 --> 02:47:52.068]  For those that haven't seen it, go see it.
[02:47:52.088 --> 02:47:53.849]  If you have seen it, get it out to people.
[02:47:53.889 --> 02:47:58.451]  Pass the link on to that and Terror Storm and all the other great films like American Freedom from Fascism.
[02:47:58.711 --> 02:48:00.292]  Have you seen Google's been taking that down?
[02:48:00.891 --> 02:48:01.852]  You know, I heard that.
[02:48:01.892 --> 02:48:04.615]  I was listening to it yesterday and Aaron Russo was on it.
[02:48:04.635 --> 02:48:05.416]  I can't believe that.
[02:48:05.436 --> 02:48:08.459]  I mean, America's freedom to fascism is such another great tool.
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:11.042]  And they don't want you to see that Ron Paul's been around.
[02:48:11.382 --> 02:48:13.365]  You know, they don't want you to see his position on the IRS.
[02:48:13.645 --> 02:48:16.588]  They don't want people to understand that you put Ron Paul in Matrix of Evil.
[02:48:16.608 --> 02:48:16.968]  When was that?
[02:48:17.009 --> 02:48:18.951]  Back in 2003?
[02:48:19.531 --> 02:48:22.835]  I mean, that's how grassroots this thing is and how far it's come.
[02:48:23.707 --> 02:48:27.829]  Gentlemen, Corey, and of course Jason and Dylan, all of you.
[02:48:28.229 --> 02:48:29.189]  I'll talk to you soon.
[02:48:29.229 --> 02:48:30.469]  Get back in there and get to editing.
[02:48:30.489 --> 02:48:33.411]  Thanks for spending 30 or 40 minutes with us, and Godspeed.
[02:48:34.031 --> 02:48:34.411]  All right, buddy.
[02:48:34.451 --> 02:48:35.171]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:48:35.371 --> 02:48:35.691]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:48:35.991 --> 02:48:36.632]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[02:48:36.812 --> 02:48:37.772]  Catch you next time.
[02:48:37.792 --> 02:48:39.513]  Oh, and by the way, you guys are doing a Saturday show.
[02:48:40.293 --> 02:48:40.893]  Saturday mornings?
[02:48:41.013 --> 02:48:44.034]  Oh, it's actually Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 8 to 10 Eastern.
[02:48:44.394 --> 02:48:45.835]  So now you've changed it and beat it up.
[02:48:49.642 --> 02:48:55.111]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:55.471 --> 02:49:03.063]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.809 --> 02:49:10.874]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:11.254 --> 02:49:22.682]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:23.003 --> 02:49:26.465]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.965 --> 02:49:28.927]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:29.227 --> 02:49:33.070]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:46.269 --> 02:50:47.990]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:48.210 --> 02:50:51.912]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:50:52.232 --> 02:50:54.453]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.

[02:51:01.337 --> 02:51:06.240]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:06.440 --> 02:51:15.385]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[02:51:51.874 --> 02:51:59.875]  We've got the number for the Santa Fe City Council that wants to have Mexican police from Mexico.
[02:52:01.485 --> 02:52:02.926]  To solve the police shortage.
[02:52:02.946 --> 02:52:03.787]  Let me give you a clue.
[02:52:04.327 --> 02:52:07.629]  We had 300 and something thousand cops 15 years ago.
[02:52:08.049 --> 02:52:09.310]  There's now over a million of them.
[02:52:09.871 --> 02:52:12.432]  Number one, we don't need more police out riding tickets.
[02:52:13.113 --> 02:52:13.733]  When they won't come.
[02:52:13.753 --> 02:52:14.774]  When your car gets stolen.
[02:52:15.154 --> 02:52:16.115]  You just raise revenue.
[02:52:16.135 --> 02:52:18.036]  And we sure don't need Mexican police.
[02:52:18.396 --> 02:52:20.058]  Known as some of the most corrupt in the world.
[02:52:20.278 --> 02:52:22.779]  I personally have been shaken down for money.
[02:52:23.019 --> 02:52:26.162]  I've seen my parents growing up who just accept it when you go down to Mexico.
[02:52:27.362 --> 02:52:28.443]  To be down in southern Mexico.
[02:52:28.463 --> 02:52:29.344]  Even the nice tourist areas.
[02:52:29.364 --> 02:52:30.745]  And they pull you over for no reason.
[02:52:31.863 --> 02:52:33.164]  We need a little money there.
[02:52:34.104 --> 02:52:35.645]  Yeah, that's what America will live under.
[02:52:36.825 --> 02:52:45.709]  Uh, you can call the Santa Fe City Council at 505-955-6813 or we can just give in to foreign Mexicans ruling us as police.
[02:52:46.689 --> 02:52:48.710]  No, this is not a Twilight Zone episode.
[02:52:48.750 --> 02:52:49.451]  This is America.
[02:52:49.471 --> 02:52:51.952]  505, this is in the Associated Press, by the way.
[02:52:51.972 --> 02:52:52.412]  505-955-6813.
[02:52:52.532 --> 02:52:52.852]  Okay, and uh...
[02:53:02.802 --> 02:53:05.624]  You can call the City Council District 1 member, 505-955-6813.
[02:53:05.644 --> 02:53:07.225]  The other guy, it's a 6812.
[02:53:07.265 --> 02:53:07.706]  Go through 6813, 6812, 6815, 6818, 6816.
[02:53:07.886 --> 02:53:08.306]  Call them all.
[02:53:28.283 --> 02:53:29.364]  Call Miguel Chavez.
[02:53:29.384 --> 02:53:31.305]  What do you want to bet he's for all this?
[02:53:31.325 --> 02:53:31.365]  505-955-6816.
[02:53:31.825 --> 02:53:32.725]  This is disgusting.
[02:53:32.825 --> 02:53:33.346]  Carmichael Dominguez.
[02:53:33.366 --> 02:53:33.406]  505-955-6814.
[02:53:49.810 --> 02:53:56.756]  You can call Matthew Ortiz at 505-955-6817 and say, listen, we know it's about Raza and all.
[02:53:57.256 --> 02:54:08.385]  We understand, you think we're dumb, we don't know what that means, race, and it's the big race takeover and all, but it's creason to go, hey, we're using Mexican troops in our army, why not have Mexican police?
[02:54:10.607 --> 02:54:11.828]  We're in a lot of trouble, America.
[02:54:13.294 --> 02:54:24.077]  You can call the traitors at the Senate who are for total, complete amnesty, and they have Yahoo and CNN and the fake conservatives all over TV saying that it stops amnesty, it is total amnesty.
[02:54:24.117 --> 02:54:29.998]  We now have sections of the bill that is secret, but senators have reported that it has what's called a Z visa, total legalization.
[02:54:30.018 --> 02:54:31.438]  202-224-3121 is the switchboard.
[02:54:31.458 --> 02:54:31.498]  202-224-3121.
[02:54:31.559 --> 02:54:32.759]  You better get on it, folks.
[02:54:32.939 --> 02:54:35.579]  And Sean Hannity's show starts in three minutes.
[02:54:42.825 --> 02:54:43.806]  I'm sorry to all the callers.
[02:54:43.846 --> 02:54:45.186]  Call me back Sunday 4 to 6.
[02:54:45.287 --> 02:54:46.107]  I'll take calls.
[02:54:46.147 --> 02:54:46.667]  Call me Monday.
[02:54:46.707 --> 02:54:47.388]  I apologize.
[02:54:47.408 --> 02:54:49.489]  I know you've been holding for 45 minutes.
[02:54:49.509 --> 02:54:51.190]  Some of you, we just can't take any more calls.
[02:54:51.210 --> 02:54:51.670]  We're out of time.
[02:54:54.192 --> 02:54:55.112]  I gotta give numbers out.
[02:54:55.133 --> 02:55:02.337]  And for every other talk show out there, Patriot, Libertarian, Conservative, if you're a real Conservative or a real American, real Liberals, whatever, help us.
[02:55:03.698 --> 02:55:05.959]  Call into Sean Hannity and let him know that he's a traitor.
[02:55:07.180 --> 02:55:07.960]  Get into the show.
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.662]  We have his phone number and stuff linked.
[02:55:12.090 --> 02:55:26.821]  1-800-941-7326 or 1-800-941-SHAWN 1-800-941-SHAWN and uh... his show starts in three minutes ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:26.841 --> 02:55:27.341]  Do it all!
[02:55:28.062 --> 02:55:30.523]  Call the Santa Fe Traders, call the police department if you like.
[02:55:30.563 --> 02:55:31.164]  I've got their number.
[02:55:31.184 --> 02:55:36.748]  You know, I'm going to get all these posted on JonesReport.com and PrisonPlanet.com for you right now.
[02:55:37.088 --> 02:55:41.131]  I've got the Chief of Police of the Santa Fe Police Department
[02:55:42.706 --> 02:55:43.367]  And, uh, that's 505-955-5010.
[02:55:43.487 --> 02:55:44.248]  Call them all!
[02:55:44.268 --> 02:55:46.191]  But mainly...
[02:55:56.468 --> 02:56:00.769]  Call the RNC and tell them, don't take Ron Paul out of the debates.
[02:56:00.789 --> 02:56:01.929]  We'll never vote for Republicans again.
[02:56:02.229 --> 02:56:06.771]  And then secondarily, call, both are important, about the amnesty.
[02:56:06.811 --> 02:56:07.551]  This is the amnesty.
[02:56:07.811 --> 02:56:08.651]  Bush says he's got a deal.
[02:56:08.671 --> 02:56:10.832]  He says they're going to secretly bring it out for a vote.
[02:56:10.912 --> 02:56:11.492]  Secret bill.
[02:56:11.532 --> 02:56:12.612]  Oh, that's always good.
[02:56:13.012 --> 02:56:14.853]  But we know it's in a total amnesty.
[02:56:15.093 --> 02:56:17.033]  They're keeping it secret and saying it is an amnesty.
[02:56:17.313 --> 02:56:18.274]  And buy the videos.
[02:56:18.294 --> 02:56:19.074]  We need your support.
[02:56:19.354 --> 02:56:21.434]  Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:56:21.714 --> 02:56:22.375]  Have a great weekend.
[02:56:22.395 --> 02:56:22.995]  See you back Sunday.
[02:56:23.015 --> 02:56:23.555]  See you back Monday.
