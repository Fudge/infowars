[00:00:05.668 --> 00:00:06.329]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.971 --> 00:00:08.073]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.735 --> 00:00:09.837]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.518 --> 00:00:11.280]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.063 --> 00:00:12.963]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.623 --> 00:00:17.645]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:30.208]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:35.410]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.090]  Welcome.
[00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.770]  It is the 14th day of May, 2007.
[00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:46.702]  We'll be live here for the next three hours on this Monday edition, and I always want to do my radio show.
[00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:53.666]  I'm always anxious and excited to get on air, but today I'm chomping at the bit.
[00:00:56.187 --> 00:01:03.091]  Today I am seething at the end of my chain, wanting to be released on the New World Order.
[00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:06.553]  We had him on about a week and a half ago, two weeks ago, St.
[00:01:06.593 --> 00:01:18.300]  John Hunt, the son of the famous CIA spy master and covert operations king, black ops commander, section chief, the list goes on and on, E. Howard Hunt.
[00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:29.908]  He'll be on for a full hour and a half, and he'll be here to talk about a few facets of the assassination that we didn't get into in our hour-long interview, and to take your phone calls.
[00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:44.051]  We're not going to just let this be glazed over the fact that E. Howard Hunt's son now has released a tape of his father talking about being a quote, bench warmer or in a support role for the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
[00:01:45.191 --> 00:01:47.633]  And how that dovetails with so many other subjects.
[00:01:48.593 --> 00:01:50.715]  Now that's not the news I'm seething to cover.
[00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:53.316]  We're going to get to that in just a minute.
[00:01:54.097 --> 00:01:58.179]  You know, I got a few emails and heard a few talk show hosts when I was out driving around last week.
[00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:01.585]  Misrepresenting what we've said about Kennedy.
[00:02:02.246 --> 00:02:06.186]  Well, yes, Alex Jones has a narrow view of the assassination.
[00:02:06.586 --> 00:02:08.787]  He isn't one of the greater thinkers, you know.
[00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:21.989]  Alex Jones thinks that LBJ did it all alone, that LBJ, Lyndon Baines Johnson, was running America, and that the buck stopped there and it was all his fault.
[00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:27.050]  But we all know that LBJ was just a puppet of the global elite.
[00:02:27.955 --> 00:02:30.416]  Well, that's exactly what we've always maintained.
[00:02:30.456 --> 00:02:32.476]  That's what our experts have said.
[00:02:33.256 --> 00:02:50.300]  From Robert Galen Ross, who was formerly with the NSA and Army Intelligence, to our good gumshoe and reporter, Jim Mars, to the literally, it's got to be more than a hundred guests I've interviewed in the last twelve years.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.681]  We know all about the JFK assassination, and no, we're not saying it was only LBJ.
[00:02:56.664 --> 00:03:17.632]  We're saying, in the compartmentalization of government, we now, from three different sides, LBJ's lawyer, Barb McClellan, LBJ's admitted mistress, Madeline Duncan Brown, and now the head of the operation at ground level, the head of the operational level, E. Howard Hunt.
[00:03:18.912 --> 00:03:25.875]  So we've broken through to that level of compartmentalization, and everyone should be rejoicing
[00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:29.978]  That this has been exposed and that it's come out this far.
[00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:40.645]  But instead of focusing on these incredible revelations, instead of helping drive it over the edge in the public psyche to finally have full disclosure, there is lots of
[00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:47.819]  I don't know, basically grandstanding and positioning and poo-pooing by many people in the movement.
[00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.120]  I mean, quite a few.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.502]  And I'm not even taking time to try to focus on what people are saying.
[00:03:52.922 --> 00:04:02.047]  I just have picked up on it, and it's quite a background of hissing and snickering and, uh, okay, I mean, fine.
[00:04:02.087 --> 00:04:04.668]  I'm not supposed to interview E. Howard Hunt's son.
[00:04:04.768 --> 00:04:06.950]  I'm not supposed to cover this.
[00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.032]  I'm just supposed to, I guess, talk about Hollywood.
[00:04:11.562 --> 00:04:13.383]  What's Brad Pitt doing these days?
[00:04:14.364 --> 00:04:19.067]  We try to give you the wide-spectrum analysis here, ladies and gentlemen, and that's what we do.
[00:04:19.347 --> 00:04:20.127]  But enough about that.
[00:04:21.208 --> 00:04:25.110]  New footage reignites BBC Building 7 controversy.
[00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.631]  Remember that broke a few months ago?
[00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:32.455]  Well, now it's back in a big way, but that is still not the article that has me chomping at the bit.
[00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:37.618]  That's not the story that has me chomping at the bit, though we will cover it in detail.
[00:04:38.817 --> 00:04:43.582]  No, my friends, when we get back, I'll tell you what has me chomping at the bit.
[00:04:44.483 --> 00:04:56.315]  You can probably find out and get a heads up before we get back if you visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, but we'll get straight into it on the other side.
[00:04:56.355 --> 00:04:58.877]  Don't forget JonesReport.com and InfoWars.net.
[00:04:58.997 --> 00:04:59.558]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:04.514 --> 00:05:09.983]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.363 --> 00:05:17.995]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:25.753]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.153 --> 00:05:37.579]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:41.401]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:43.783]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.103 --> 00:05:47.965]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:58.135 --> 00:06:59.997]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:03.943]  Do you know how much you can go with solar for under 1200 bucks now?
[00:07:04.463 --> 00:07:05.605]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[00:07:05.785 --> 00:07:09.931]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:07:10.538 --> 00:07:15.421]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[00:07:15.942 --> 00:07:22.426]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[00:07:23.106 --> 00:07:25.828]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[00:07:25.968 --> 00:07:30.471]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel,
[00:07:31.111 --> 00:07:35.932]  A 3000 watt peak converter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[00:07:36.192 --> 00:07:39.913]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[00:07:39.953 --> 00:07:42.393]  You know, power companies, government, ahem.
[00:07:42.794 --> 00:07:46.454]  Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[00:07:46.634 --> 00:07:47.675]  Are you ready to go solar?
[00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:51.315]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073 or order them on my website at a 10% discount on KenSolar.com.
[00:07:51.335 --> 00:07:51.995]  That's KenSolar.com.
[00:08:03.042 --> 00:08:17.046]  We have new Building 7 developments that I'll get to at the bottom of the hour.
[00:08:17.066 --> 00:08:20.827]  New footage reignites BBC Building 7 controversy.
[00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:25.889]  Reporter's audio feed interrupted again as she discusses
[00:08:26.716 --> 00:08:35.283]  WTC7 earlier window shot proves footage not blue screen as ludicrous debunkers maintain despite BBC's admission
[00:08:37.335 --> 00:08:43.678]  It's an important story for several reasons, but mainly because it just brings this original story back to light.
[00:08:44.318 --> 00:09:02.565]  The BBC reporting 20 plus minutes before Building 7 fell that it had fallen, then we learned that CNN reported long before it fell that it had fallen, and that dovetail with the firemen, the police, the emergency workers, saying they were told Building 7 was going to be brought down to quote, shave other buildings around it.
[00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:06.673]  But the question is, how do you plant controlled demolitions in there that quick?
[00:09:07.093 --> 00:09:17.039]  And then the secondary question, why is the government then still saying it fell from fire, while on the other side of its mouth, telling everybody on the ground they blew it up, which they clearly did with controlled demo.
[00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:18.680]  That is coming up.
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:19.820]  St.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:27.365]  John Hunt scheduled later in the broadcast with us as well, Part 2 of the interview we did a few weeks ago, when all of that news broke nationally.
[00:09:29.066 --> 00:09:31.327]  But what's got me most upset today?
[00:09:33.994 --> 00:09:55.711]  Every time I talk about this, people post on my MySpace account, or I get emails, or a few people even call into the show, and what happens is they're lazy, or they don't know how to do Google or Yahoo searches, or LexisNexis, and they just say, I looked, I couldn't find it.
[00:09:56.131 --> 00:09:56.912]  Show me!
[00:09:58.773 --> 00:09:59.414]  Show me!
[00:10:01.795 --> 00:10:03.637]  Okay, I'll show you.
[00:10:05.058 --> 00:10:08.940]  It was about four and a half years ago in Minnesota.
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:14.362]  These are just the cases I remember because these are the big ones where I did interviews and spent a lot of time on.
[00:10:14.382 --> 00:10:17.083]  If I just glazed over something, I don't remember it.
[00:10:17.363 --> 00:10:18.864]  But if I focused on it, I remember it.
[00:10:19.624 --> 00:10:21.145]  It was a school in Minneapolis.
[00:10:22.465 --> 00:10:24.086]  It was the portable buildings in the back.
[00:10:24.286 --> 00:10:26.867]  It was a seventh grade class.
[00:10:27.971 --> 00:10:32.653]  And over 20 men in black uniforms busted in and said, this is a hostage situation.
[00:10:33.013 --> 00:10:34.794]  We're going to effing kill you.
[00:10:35.394 --> 00:10:37.175]  And they put a gun to the teacher's head.
[00:10:37.655 --> 00:10:41.376]  The class began wetting and soiling themselves.
[00:10:41.836 --> 00:10:44.037]  They took them in the woods and said, now we're going to kill you.
[00:10:44.417 --> 00:10:49.099]  The teacher collapsed and has now basically been in psychiatric care ever since.
[00:10:49.439 --> 00:10:50.560]  She couldn't handle the pressure.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.840]  And that was in the paper.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.661]  And the cops said, yeah, we didn't announce it.
[00:10:53.681 --> 00:10:55.601]  And we came in and put guns to their heads.
[00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:56.702]  You know, they're
[00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.500]  They're eleven years old, they can handle it.
[00:11:01.582 --> 00:11:12.188]  And in Road to Tyranny, we have footage, I made that film over five years ago, with police yelling and screaming, pointing guns at children, and you see fifth graders crying and begging for their lives.
[00:11:12.228 --> 00:11:15.631]  I mean, their faces are completely wet with tears.
[00:11:17.632 --> 00:11:18.933]  And they, again, put it on the news.
[00:11:18.973 --> 00:11:20.814]  I mean, they think it's so normal, they put it on the news.
[00:11:21.534 --> 00:11:22.775]  And then a few months ago,
[00:11:24.582 --> 00:11:31.805]  Had another case in Michigan where they unannounced came in and men busted in with guns, put it to the children's heads.
[00:11:31.945 --> 00:11:34.447]  This was a elementary and a middle school the same day.
[00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:39.629]  They again soiled themselves and urinated all over themselves.
[00:11:40.489 --> 00:11:42.390]  And this went on for eight hours.
[00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.231]  Of course, no lunch was allowed.
[00:11:44.811 --> 00:11:48.153]  They do that quite often in the drills to create the heightened fear.
[00:11:48.857 --> 00:11:50.679]  It's standard when CPS takes your children.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:56.166]  If it takes three days of no food, it will happen until the child gives a video report of your abuse.
[00:11:56.727 --> 00:11:58.469]  And children will lie about you for food!
[00:11:59.938 --> 00:12:01.519]  Most adults will break under torture.
[00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:07.721]  You have to understand, the way they do all this is just like last week, when Bush announced North American Union.
[00:12:07.902 --> 00:12:09.942]  He said, we're integrating the economies and the governments.
[00:12:10.283 --> 00:12:13.064]  Publicly, they signed the deal, and it got no attention.
[00:12:13.104 --> 00:12:19.506]  When they tried to make SPP and the NAU, North American Union, secret, it became big news because of the secrecy.
[00:12:20.567 --> 00:12:26.009]  Now they just said, yeah, we're merging the two, that's it, period, and they had a big press conference on the White House lawn.
[00:12:27.691 --> 00:12:28.331]  Same thing here.
[00:12:28.491 --> 00:12:36.254]  They splatter fake blood, blow up buses, terrorize children as young as six.
[00:12:37.335 --> 00:12:40.096]  They have also shot children in the face in Detroit in drills.
[00:12:40.496 --> 00:12:41.556]  Michigan keeps coming up.
[00:12:42.036 --> 00:12:43.057]  Florida keeps coming up.
[00:12:44.177 --> 00:12:45.318]  The new one is Tennessee.
[00:12:45.458 --> 00:12:51.220]  Now I know most of you who don't believe me and never check out what I claim, you're just going to say everything I just said was a lie.
[00:12:53.952 --> 00:13:00.794]  Because it's only regionally reported, and even if you saw it, when you see the mainstream say it, you decide to accept it, and then it's good.
[00:13:01.035 --> 00:13:01.835]  That's double-think.
[00:13:02.095 --> 00:13:03.736]  And then when I say it, it's not true.
[00:13:04.296 --> 00:13:06.236]  So I wanted to bring you the newest one.
[00:13:06.276 --> 00:13:07.217]  This is today.
[00:13:07.877 --> 00:13:08.797]  This is today.
[00:13:09.237 --> 00:13:12.879]  BBC, USA Today, and I have the local newspaper.
[00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:13.959]  It's even worse, of course.
[00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:16.280]  And I have the press release by the school.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.061]  The school administrators should all be arrested.
[00:13:20.775 --> 00:13:22.096]  This is a terroristic act.
[00:13:22.196 --> 00:13:24.777]  They literally did take the children hostage.
[00:13:25.197 --> 00:13:32.340]  Oh, by the way, the cop that told Luke he'd plant a bomb on him, or said he would claim he had a bomb, was fired.
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.581]  We'll have details of that coming out on Prison Planet in the next hour.
[00:13:35.902 --> 00:13:36.922]  Paul's working on that right now.
[00:13:39.168 --> 00:13:45.193]  And so, again, we also wrote an article, we posted the New York state law and federal law, and of course there were firings.
[00:13:45.233 --> 00:13:51.498]  I mean, when you have the law, and you can actually show the video of them breaking the law, it's hard for the system.
[00:13:51.898 --> 00:13:59.504]  Please stop breaking the law, and we'll stop sending the director of AXS TV to prison, and we'll stop getting people fired, and we'll stop doing all of this.
[00:13:59.584 --> 00:14:02.106]  But all of these people need to be arrested.
[00:14:02.807 --> 00:14:04.948]  And the officers need to be arrested right now.
[00:14:06.009 --> 00:14:07.971]  And the police chief that gave the order needs to be arrested.
[00:14:08.783 --> 00:14:13.505]  But the bigger story here is they keep acting like this stuff just happens out of the blue.
[00:14:13.905 --> 00:14:25.109]  When you read the local articles in Texas, Florida, New York, Tennessee, Michigan, California, it's happening everywhere, Missouri, Kansas, when you read this,
[00:14:26.488 --> 00:14:29.450]  When you read the local papers, it's always a federal grant.
[00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:37.316]  In some cases, the local police will get a hundred grand or close to it in other cases, and the school gets close to that for doing this.
[00:14:37.716 --> 00:14:40.698]  Now, this is trauma-based mind control.
[00:14:40.999 --> 00:14:44.201]  This is right out of MKUltra, MKNaomi.
[00:14:44.261 --> 00:14:46.643]  This is hard core
[00:14:47.606 --> 00:14:48.907]  This is what terrorists do.
[00:14:48.967 --> 00:14:52.891]  They will, when they capture you and they want to break you, they will simulate killing you.
[00:14:52.911 --> 00:14:55.713]  They will put you in a blindfold and tell you they're going to kill you.
[00:14:56.013 --> 00:14:57.555]  They did this in Tennessee.
[00:14:58.416 --> 00:14:59.236]  That's right, folks.
[00:14:59.917 --> 00:15:04.080]  They actually engaged in one of the most hardcore forms of torture.
[00:15:04.501 --> 00:15:05.602]  Breaking somebody's fingers.
[00:15:06.585 --> 00:15:09.708]  And by the way, there are CIA torture manuals that are now declassified in public.
[00:15:09.748 --> 00:15:11.730]  These are the old ones from the 60s on this.
[00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.412]  This is classified as one of the worst forms.
[00:15:14.993 --> 00:15:28.085]  The only thing above this is actually waterboarding you because it creates the sensation of dying that now they use more sophisticated drugs when you're strapped down to a gurney to actually stop your heart and then start it again while you're fully conscious.
[00:15:29.981 --> 00:15:36.604]  I had a chance, unfortunately, to see this happen to my best friend who was dying of massive total organ failure.
[00:15:36.624 --> 00:15:46.168]  They had him alive on the respirator, pumping him full of drugs to keep him alive so family could get into town to literally just to see him before he died and it was like a zombie movie.
[00:15:46.208 --> 00:15:51.731]  He was dead, but the drugs that were pumping into him as everything collapsed, his arteries and veins,
[00:15:52.683 --> 00:15:53.003]  I don't know.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.904]  And the pastor was in there telling him he was going to die and he was squeezing his hand and he knew.
[00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:17.727]  Well, they do that when they torture people, but that's the worst form of torture.
[00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:23.412]  Right below that is making you think you're going to be killed.
[00:16:24.613 --> 00:16:28.276]  They put you in a blindfold, they put you in the dark, and they say, now I'm going to blow your head off.
[00:16:28.636 --> 00:16:30.978]  They did this to young children in Tennessee.
[00:16:31.852 --> 00:16:34.053]  They all need to be arrested immediately.
[00:16:34.113 --> 00:16:38.956]  Now, in other cases, it's gotten worse in Michigan where they also throw blood on them while they scream it.
[00:16:39.996 --> 00:16:42.818]  And I mean, ladies and gentlemen, it's in the local papers.
[00:16:42.858 --> 00:16:46.320]  There is feces all over the place.
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.560]  There's urine all over the place.
[00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:50.001]  They will keep them in these things for eight hours.
[00:16:50.021 --> 00:16:54.404]  They make them go publicly as part of humiliation in the trash cans.
[00:16:55.884 --> 00:16:56.765]  This is in drills.
[00:16:57.623 --> 00:17:18.156]  Now, folks, this is the equivalent, this is worse than, you see stuff in Red Dawn, the barbed wire fences around the schools, and the sports stadium, and America is a pig, or how's your founding fathers, or dogs, and they beat people up until others renounce them, and they get other people to tattle on each other, and they've got loudspeakers going, and keep you awake at all hours.
[00:17:18.416 --> 00:17:21.538]  That's a 60-year-old Soviet model.
[00:17:22.019 --> 00:17:26.842]  That's child's play, ladies and gentlemen, to what America does.
[00:17:27.342 --> 00:17:28.902]  And the cops are totally brainwashed.
[00:17:28.922 --> 00:17:31.643]  These cops have been incrementally vetted.
[00:17:31.923 --> 00:17:33.303]  Weak-minded people are found.
[00:17:33.323 --> 00:17:35.524]  The classic M.O.
[00:17:35.544 --> 00:17:37.424]  of these SWAT team cops is wimps.
[00:17:37.885 --> 00:17:39.065]  Military wash-ups.
[00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:42.066]  They've got Cobra Commander toy sets at home.
[00:17:42.126 --> 00:17:43.246]  I'm serious when I say this.
[00:17:43.486 --> 00:17:44.506]  We've totally assessed them.
[00:17:45.046 --> 00:17:46.627]  They're not usually good marksmen.
[00:17:48.307 --> 00:17:51.628]  A lot of times we're either bullies or we're beaten up a lot.
[00:17:53.068 --> 00:17:54.949]  Most of them didn't have a father at home.
[00:17:55.610 --> 00:18:00.093]  Most of them either tried to play football, couldn't make the team.
[00:18:00.113 --> 00:18:01.674]  You know, they're that type.
[00:18:01.954 --> 00:18:04.016]  And they also have low IQs.
[00:18:04.837 --> 00:18:09.420]  And so you get these types, and so they're very weak-minded.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:15.385]  And they've been through training where FEMA tells them all Christians are terrorists, gun owners... By the way, we have video, not just training manuals.
[00:18:15.685 --> 00:18:16.626]  Send Rugged Tierney, of course.
[00:18:17.587 --> 00:18:20.689]  Again, no matter how... I know it's hard to believe this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:21.069 --> 00:18:22.050]  This is what's happened.
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.561]  This is the reality.
[00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:30.345]  Now, 20, 30 years ago, the SWAT teams were made up of real men, because I've interviewed a lot of them, I've read a lot of books about it, I've studied it.
[00:18:30.626 --> 00:18:35.930]  They called all those guys out, because they didn't get off on stomping on women and just acting tough.
[00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.832]  They were actually there to get the job done.
[00:18:39.092 --> 00:18:41.794]  They want mindless idiots, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:42.135 --> 00:18:43.295]  Now, they have had cases.
[00:18:43.335 --> 00:18:48.579]  They had one in a suburb of, what's the name of the city?
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.621]  The big one up in Washington.
[00:18:50.641 --> 00:18:52.322]  I'm having one of those moments.
[00:18:52.683 --> 00:18:53.103]  Seattle.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.402]  I was trying to access the actual name of the town, and then I messed up on Seattle.
[00:18:57.422 --> 00:18:58.603]  It was a town outside Seattle.
[00:18:59.083 --> 00:19:08.389]  Four years ago, the police chief, the feds asked him to, and then he got real mad and got in an argument with the mayor, saying, no, we're not going to go terrorize kids.
[00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.371]  I do remember that was in a newspaper.
[00:19:11.511 --> 00:19:18.236]  The only case I know of, but I would imagine there have been a lot of others, where people go, no, we don't run in unannounced and put guns to children's heads.
[00:19:19.602 --> 00:19:24.864]  And then turn the lights off or put blindfolds on them and tell them, now you're all gonna die, as they did in Minnesota.
[00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:25.764]  And Michigan.
[00:19:27.245 --> 00:19:30.266]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, and when we get back, I'm gonna get into it.
[00:19:30.346 --> 00:19:33.127]  Teacher staged fake gun attack on kids.
[00:19:33.907 --> 00:19:34.927]  See, they got greedy.
[00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:38.528]  They didn't even want to give the local cops any of the money.
[00:19:38.929 --> 00:19:40.409]  So now they're doing it themselves.
[00:19:41.649 --> 00:19:44.110]  I want the principal arrested.
[00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:46.091]  Hard jail time.
[00:19:46.829 --> 00:19:48.151]  Let me just advise everybody.
[00:19:48.511 --> 00:19:51.634]  You terrorize my kids and you put guns to their heads and say they're going to die.
[00:19:52.896 --> 00:19:56.880]  You are not going to have a very good life from that point forward.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.682]  Let me just put it on the record right now.
[00:20:01.565 --> 00:20:04.727]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:20:04.767 --> 00:20:08.810]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.512]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:20:11.572 --> 00:20:13.893]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:20:14.074 --> 00:20:22.519]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:20:22.599 --> 00:20:23.920]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.063]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:20:28.143 --> 00:20:28.783]  We're good to go!
[00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:51.519]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.
[00:20:51.539 --> 00:20:53.421]  888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:20:53.481 --> 00:20:54.622]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.383 --> 00:21:05.004]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:21:05.284 --> 00:21:08.785]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[00:21:09.105 --> 00:21:17.966]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.

[00:21:31.169 --> 00:21:31.830]  We're good to go.
[00:22:02.774 --> 00:22:04.816]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:05.457 --> 00:22:14.385]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.806 --> 00:22:22.033]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:22.739 --> 00:22:28.244]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:22:28.724 --> 00:22:39.574]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:22:40.314 --> 00:22:42.396]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:22:42.877 --> 00:22:44.518]  For more information, call 702-953-ZERO.
[00:23:01.648 --> 00:23:07.631]  So you take care of your car, you change the oil, tune it up on a regular basis, and always make sure that it's running at its best.
[00:23:07.851 --> 00:23:10.153]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[00:23:10.433 --> 00:23:13.714]  That's why you need SFR's Protect-A synthetic oil treatments.
[00:23:13.915 --> 00:23:18.697]  Protect-A engine treatment, Protect-A transmission treatment, and Protect-A complete fuel system treatment.
[00:23:18.937 --> 00:23:26.679]  Protekta meets the demands you put on your vehicle by providing more horsepower, improving gas mileage, decreasing emissions, and promotes longer engine life.
[00:23:26.999 --> 00:23:33.860]  Only Protekta contains a new technology, Nano-B, which is not found in any competitive additive products at your local auto parts store.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.380]  At Protekta, we do not compromise quality.
[00:23:36.541 --> 00:23:41.281]  Because you expect the very best, we provide products that work right the first time, every time.
[00:23:41.542 --> 00:23:43.922]  So get more when you treat it right with Protekta.
[00:23:44.182 --> 00:23:44.603]  We're good to go.
[00:24:06.122 --> 00:24:16.045]  In constant sorrow He stays I am the man of constant sorrow I've seen trouble all my days
[00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.171]  Alright, welcome back.
[00:25:05.237 --> 00:25:06.598]  We cannot stand for this.
[00:25:06.658 --> 00:25:09.381]  This is mass, federally funded, mind control.
[00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:19.009]  If they can take your children out of the blue, imagine a door bust open, screaming, full-grown men run in on elementary, middle school, and high school students.
[00:25:19.069 --> 00:25:19.969]  It runs the whole gamut.
[00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:23.232]  Put guns to their head, and every time it's, oh, the school's sorry.
[00:25:23.733 --> 00:25:24.914]  Got our 100 grand, though.
[00:25:25.274 --> 00:25:26.595]  Got our 75 grand.
[00:25:26.635 --> 00:25:29.097]  Got our 80 grand, depending on the operation.
[00:25:29.678 --> 00:25:32.380]  Oh, we're sorry if you're upset, but we're still going to keep doing them.
[00:25:33.357 --> 00:25:41.303]  I mean, in fact, the principle in the last case in Michigan that we just heard about, that's what people complain about, it happens everywhere, I just said, well, I'm from the military, you're just not patriotic.
[00:25:41.923 --> 00:25:51.030]  What's really sick is I was reading the Post on USA Today about this, and it's like, this is good, I'm a law enforcement officer, I think this is good, this is the real world.
[00:25:51.990 --> 00:26:02.338]  You know, 20 years ago, we didn't do drills where you put guns to children's heads unannounced, and by the way, back then, cops would run in if there was a shooter and take them out before they could kill 33 people and wound another 25.
[00:26:03.849 --> 00:26:11.134]  But now you wait four and a half hours, or four hours, fifteen minutes at Columbine, two plus hours in Virginia, at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.
[00:26:12.435 --> 00:26:12.996]  Here it is!
[00:26:13.156 --> 00:26:16.818]  Teacher stage fake gun attack on kids.
[00:26:17.399 --> 00:26:20.621]  Associated Press, Murfreesboro, Tennessee.
[00:26:21.121 --> 00:26:22.642]  I know we've got listeners all over Tennessee.
[00:26:22.682 --> 00:26:24.143]  Get over there and get video of this school.
[00:26:24.624 --> 00:26:30.548]  Confront this principal when he's out in the street, or if you know him locally, call him up, confront him over the telephone.
[00:26:31.892 --> 00:26:35.775]  Let them know that the country is disgusted by this criminal act.
[00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:38.296]  And it is criminal to terrorize children.
[00:26:38.396 --> 00:26:42.319]  Anybody else... You know, if a cop did this in an unsanctioned environment, he'd go to jail.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:50.345]  Staff members of an elementary school staged a fictitious gun attack on students during a class trip, telling them it was not a drill.
[00:26:50.805 --> 00:26:53.927]  Not a drill, as the children cried and hid under tables.
[00:26:54.808 --> 00:26:58.270]  Now, you start reading local papers and you hear the real... It gets much worse.
[00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:02.932]  The mock attack Thursday night was intended as a learning experience.
[00:27:03.532 --> 00:27:04.433]  Learn how to cower.
[00:27:04.493 --> 00:27:05.453]  Learn how to be a slave.
[00:27:05.493 --> 00:27:06.933]  They tell you what to do under an attack.
[00:27:07.313 --> 00:27:08.694]  Act like jellyfish and lay there.
[00:27:08.974 --> 00:27:11.074]  Which they did in Virginia Tech where they had drills.
[00:27:11.334 --> 00:27:12.695]  Didn't work too well for you, did it?
[00:27:13.635 --> 00:27:20.097]  The mock attack Thursday night was intended as a learning experience and lasted five minutes during a week-long trip to a state park.
[00:27:20.577 --> 00:27:22.958]  Yeah, who knows what else they're doing to them when they're at that state park.
[00:27:23.498 --> 00:27:27.999]  Said Scales Elementary School Assistant Principal Don Bartik.
[00:27:28.815 --> 00:27:31.197]  Bart, I can't, it's Bart and C.H.
[00:27:31.677 --> 00:27:33.578]  Bart, I guess, who led the trip.
[00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:37.601]  We got together and discussed what we could have done in a real situation, he said.
[00:27:37.881 --> 00:27:40.924]  But parents of the sixth grade students were outraged.
[00:27:41.184 --> 00:27:42.665]  Yeah, it's generally sixth grade.
[00:27:42.685 --> 00:27:44.006]  They've done it down to third grade, though.
[00:27:44.746 --> 00:27:49.189]  The children were in the room in the dark, begging for their lives.
[00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:50.650]  Let me say that again.
[00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.672]  Because if we get conditioned to this now,
[00:27:54.091 --> 00:27:57.754]  They're just going to keep doing it, see, until we finally... Oh, Alex, we've heard about it a hundred times.
[00:27:58.114 --> 00:27:59.295]  Yeah, it happened at my school.
[00:27:59.915 --> 00:28:01.216]  Yeah, MySpace censors.
[00:28:01.236 --> 00:28:02.917]  Yeah, CNN censors, Ron Paul.
[00:28:03.218 --> 00:28:04.659]  Yeah, they all censor, so what?
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.421]  Yeah, they get rid of our borders.
[00:28:07.461 --> 00:28:10.323]  Yeah, the illegal aliens don't have to have IDs, but citizens do.
[00:28:10.363 --> 00:28:12.144]  Yeah, okay, you know, see how they do it?
[00:28:13.245 --> 00:28:15.747]  Yeah, I know they're making people take trips now to get jobs.
[00:28:15.787 --> 00:28:16.707]  Yeah, I know, you know.
[00:28:17.588 --> 00:28:18.909]  We can't let that happen to us.
[00:28:19.634 --> 00:28:28.238]  The children were in that room in the dark, begging for their lives, because they thought there was someone with a gun after them, said Brady Cole, whose son went to the trip.
[00:28:28.898 --> 00:28:31.840]  Now again, this is, this is the next level.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.361]  I mean, this is, this is an A-plus in torture.
[00:28:35.942 --> 00:28:44.926]  This is, on the scale of types of torture, and the CIA has this in manuals, right before the worst, at 100%, right up next to it is this form of torture.
[00:28:46.923 --> 00:28:58.733]  Some parents said they were upset by, see how they phrased that, oh some, were upset by the staff's poor judgment in light of the April 16th shootings at Virginia Tech that left 33 students and professors dead, including the gunman.
[00:28:59.533 --> 00:29:04.757]  During the last night of the trip, staff members convinced the 69 students that there was a gunman on the loose.
[00:29:05.098 --> 00:29:08.280]  They were told to lie on the floor or hide underneath tables and stay quiet.
[00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:14.866]  A teacher disguised in a hooded sweatshirt even pulled on a locker door.
[00:29:14.926 --> 00:29:16.507]  Now let me tell you what I'd have done.
[00:29:17.398 --> 00:29:20.319]  And frankly, for those that haven't grown up like this, you probably don't believe it.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.861]  I'd already... Oh, it sounds ridiculous.
[00:29:23.901 --> 00:29:25.602]  I was quite a scrapper by the 6th grade.
[00:29:25.642 --> 00:29:26.342]  Looked to you that way.
[00:29:27.282 --> 00:29:29.443]  I guarantee you, I would have physically attacked this person.
[00:29:29.724 --> 00:29:33.485]  I'd have flipped out, gotten some type of flagpole or weapon and gone after him.
[00:29:36.106 --> 00:29:45.971]  Uh... I guarantee there'd be kids who'd flunk a couple grades who probably would have... You know, and I guess in the old way we used to be, this... That's very dangerous.
[00:29:47.443 --> 00:29:50.729]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.631 --> 00:29:52.552]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.053 --> 00:29:54.636]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.578 --> 00:29:58.282]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:51.817 --> 00:31:52.558]  We're good.
[00:32:01.727 --> 00:32:05.769]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:32:05.989 --> 00:32:09.391]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:32:09.572 --> 00:32:13.294]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:32:13.314 --> 00:32:16.576]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:32:16.596 --> 00:32:22.059]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[00:32:22.079 --> 00:32:27.322]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[00:32:27.722 --> 00:32:28.743]  Thank you for your time.

[00:32:49.864 --> 00:32:49.924]  1-877-928-8822.
[00:33:18.265 --> 00:33:36.409]  It was actually in seventh grade.
[00:33:37.949 --> 00:33:40.850]  I was in the bathroom and one of the kids had flunked like three times.
[00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:45.651]  Some gang member attacked me because I was... People fought a lot when I grew up in Dallas.
[00:33:46.428 --> 00:33:49.573]  And the principal ran in, which sounds so ridiculous.
[00:33:50.674 --> 00:33:55.401]  But I guess for people that have actually been around stuff like this, they know young people are something else.
[00:33:56.643 --> 00:33:57.904]  It's like child soldiers.
[00:33:58.625 --> 00:33:59.567]  And the principal
[00:34:00.456 --> 00:34:00.736]  I don't know.
[00:34:26.133 --> 00:34:34.380]  But my point is there's always those types of students, even if you try to suppress the killer instinct or the attack instinct in people.
[00:34:35.781 --> 00:34:40.105]  And I guarantee you this could have gone dangerous where you've got 60 plus students.
[00:34:41.406 --> 00:34:42.888]  And of course that was 7th grade.
[00:34:42.968 --> 00:34:47.592]  I guess 6th grade I'd been in a few fights too and I wasn't one-tenth as mean.
[00:34:47.632 --> 00:34:50.414]  I mean in development a year can be so much.
[00:34:50.474 --> 00:34:53.637]  But still, I guarantee you there were some tough 6th graders in there.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:35:04.867]  You know, who would go after the flag in the corner or a chair or something else, you know, with the guy in the black mask trying to come in and the children all screaming and yelling.
[00:35:05.227 --> 00:35:06.448]  It's just so dangerous.
[00:35:08.429 --> 00:35:15.934]  It's just unbelievably, unbelievably dangerous.
[00:35:18.516 --> 00:35:23.739]  And, I mean, I digress getting into what I would have done as a sixth grader.
[00:35:25.757 --> 00:35:30.240]  It's just so dangerous for everybody involved.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.181]  And again, top of the year, and by the way, it's in Road to Tyranny.
[00:35:33.241 --> 00:35:37.424]  I just use these examples because I've seen many others since then, but this is stuff I've got in the film.
[00:35:38.304 --> 00:35:41.986]  In Road to Tyranny, released in February of 2002.
[00:35:45.168 --> 00:35:52.112]  I have top of the year, Fort Worth, Texas, in a school grill, shot in the head by one of the other SWAT team members.
[00:35:53.582 --> 00:36:01.128]  And we have, from right around that time, a school shooting drill where it shows the children screaming and crying, and these are elementary students.
[00:36:01.809 --> 00:36:04.511]  I mean, bawling with guys pointing guns at them and dragging them around.
[00:36:06.833 --> 00:36:10.936]  But there's been countless other examples of this, and they do this with high schoolers, too.
[00:36:10.956 --> 00:36:15.260]  They tell them that there's going to be an attack, and I guarantee you there's some mean people in high school.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:21.144]  I mean, people are frankly more aggressive when they're just coming into their hormones and, you know, just coming into their manhood.
[00:36:21.805 --> 00:36:22.986]  And, you know, it's all popping.
[00:36:23.706 --> 00:36:32.214]  I mean, I remember some of the stuff I did when I was 16, 17 years old, and my God, somebody tell me there's somebody in a school with a gun, I'm not going to sit there quietly and just wait for them to come and kill me.
[00:36:32.894 --> 00:36:33.875]  I'll guarantee you, folks.
[00:36:34.596 --> 00:36:37.459]  I mean, I just couldn't wait to get into something with people back then.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:44.325]  But in Michigan, in Detroit, they shot a 5th grader in the face.
[00:36:45.166 --> 00:36:48.409]  The last time I heard, they were doing reconstructive surgery and the cop had been fired.
[00:36:49.395 --> 00:36:55.060]  And he's in there, in a drill, and shoots the girl in the face and blew off her face.
[00:36:55.881 --> 00:36:57.963]  You know, blew her jaw off her face.
[00:36:59.965 --> 00:37:05.890]  I don't know, the Detroit Free Press just said that it had caused major damage to her face, shot her in the jaw.
[00:37:07.212 --> 00:37:08.333]  I mean, this is unbelievable!
[00:37:09.694 --> 00:37:11.856]  Well, it's for a greater good!
[00:37:12.236 --> 00:37:13.457]  It'll try to!
[00:37:14.628 --> 00:37:15.308]  And this is how they do it.
[00:37:15.328 --> 00:37:17.589]  They have these cops constantly training, training, training.
[00:37:17.809 --> 00:37:20.530]  And the training gets weirder and weirder and weirder and weirder.
[00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:23.531]  Now they have torture training, pain compliance training.
[00:37:24.571 --> 00:37:27.613]  Again, it's illegal to torture somebody at Abu Ghraib, but they do it.
[00:37:28.513 --> 00:37:31.214]  Or Camp X-Ray, but then they just call it pain compliance.
[00:37:31.674 --> 00:37:39.997]  And we post videos every weekend where they'll just say, Get up and go to the wagon, to the paddy wagon, or I will have to taser you.
[00:37:40.377 --> 00:37:43.438]  The woman lays there, they taser her repeatedly, and she flops her mouth.
[00:37:44.205 --> 00:37:47.127]  Or the guy who's at the hospital, they say, give a urine sample.
[00:37:47.147 --> 00:37:48.048]  He says, I can't go.
[00:37:48.348 --> 00:37:49.949]  So the officer tasers him three times.
[00:37:49.989 --> 00:37:50.670]  That was Miami.
[00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.592]  These are just examples that I've covered on air that I remember.
[00:37:53.852 --> 00:38:02.298]  In six months, I'll say, remember Murphysboro, Tennessee, where they turned the lights off, the same thing as blindfolding, and said, the killer's coming to get you.
[00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:04.159]  Sixth graders.
[00:38:04.499 --> 00:38:07.501]  And you'll email me and go, that's a lie.
[00:38:07.541 --> 00:38:09.683]  They wouldn't do such a thing.
[00:38:14.537 --> 00:38:17.599]  Teachers staged a fake gun attack on kids.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:28.507]  Staff members of an elementary school staged a fictitious gun attack on students during a class trip, telling them it was not a drill, as the children cried and hid under the tables.
[00:38:28.887 --> 00:38:40.796]  The children were in the room in the dark, begging for their lives, because they thought there was someone with a gun after them, said Brady Cole, whose son went on the trip.
[00:38:45.012 --> 00:38:49.193]  Some parents said they were upset by the staff's poor judgment in the light of the 16th shooting.
[00:38:49.433 --> 00:38:50.533]  They don't need to be arrested!
[00:38:50.953 --> 00:38:52.354]  This is terrorizing!
[00:38:52.574 --> 00:38:54.054]  This is terroristic threats!
[00:38:56.955 --> 00:39:01.696]  I mean, police listing, you know all the laws about terrorizing people.
[00:39:01.956 --> 00:39:02.856]  You know you're breaking them.
[00:39:03.076 --> 00:39:04.076]  The cops didn't do this.
[00:39:04.936 --> 00:39:09.217]  I mean, cops at least have some training and get invited in or ordered to do it.
[00:39:09.457 --> 00:39:12.838]  And so there's some thin veil of
[00:39:15.433 --> 00:39:15.893]  Immunity.
[00:39:17.534 --> 00:39:18.754]  There's at least some claim of it.
[00:39:19.014 --> 00:39:20.775]  These teachers should all need to go to jail.
[00:39:21.435 --> 00:39:23.036]  And this principal needs to go to jail.
[00:39:23.896 --> 00:39:35.681]  They just thought they'd do this, and I guarantee you, I guarantee you, this is a federal grant, and I guarantee you a lot more happened than just this.
[00:39:36.862 --> 00:39:38.862]  By the way, I just learned of this about an hour before air time.
[00:39:39.283 --> 00:39:40.623]  I was on my Myspace and saw it.
[00:39:40.943 --> 00:39:42.804]  By the time I called Paul, he'd already posted it.
[00:39:44.941 --> 00:39:49.065]  But, uh, I did find the local articles and I was so busy with other stuff.
[00:39:49.405 --> 00:39:49.885]  Where is it?
[00:39:50.826 --> 00:39:52.608]  Got my stack all mixed up here.
[00:39:53.388 --> 00:39:53.869]  Ah, here it is.
[00:39:56.271 --> 00:39:58.893]  Scales Elementary, Murfreesboro City School.
[00:40:05.863 --> 00:40:07.804]  And, uh, yeah, it's all lies.
[00:40:07.964 --> 00:40:10.066]  You read it, it's all lies, as usual.
[00:40:10.426 --> 00:40:11.767]  They did a co-read procedure.
[00:40:12.387 --> 00:40:14.729]  They say, well, the children didn't know, but they did.
[00:40:14.749 --> 00:40:16.970]  And they said it was just a prank.
[00:40:22.433 --> 00:40:23.274]  You all need to go to jail.
[00:40:25.135 --> 00:40:25.896]  I'll say it right now.
[00:40:27.216 --> 00:40:32.880]  And, you know, maybe you are just idiots, and you thought you'd get the federal money, and you're gonna go, well, the feds gave us the money!
[00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:35.545]  You need to go to prison!
[00:40:36.406 --> 00:40:38.027]  You need to spend about a year apiece.
[00:40:38.547 --> 00:40:43.471]  The principal needs to spend about five years in prison, and every one of these teachers needs to spend about a year in prison.
[00:40:44.211 --> 00:40:47.934]  Anybody that took part in this needs to go to jail.
[00:40:50.776 --> 00:40:53.538]  By the way, this ruins people's lives, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:54.778 --> 00:40:57.640]  A lot of people can't handle things like this.
[00:40:58.001 --> 00:40:59.922]  This is a life-changing experience.
[00:41:04.358 --> 00:41:06.200]  How do I know it's a life changing experience?
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:10.823]  I've talked several stories about having knives pulled on me, guns, things like that.
[00:41:12.024 --> 00:41:26.515]  I was 13 years old and I, we grew up in an upper middle class, you know, neighborhood where, you know, my dad is a dentist in a four bedroom house, about the smallest houses in the neighborhood.
[00:41:26.535 --> 00:41:29.178]  You know, there were 15 bedroom houses in the neighborhood.
[00:41:30.999 --> 00:41:33.381]  Talk about rich scum, the type of people I grew up around.
[00:41:34.299 --> 00:41:39.641]  And I snuck out at about midnight, went to some party, drank some beer.
[00:41:39.661 --> 00:41:43.402]  I mean, there were college students at this party, probably only about 20 people or so there.
[00:41:45.122 --> 00:41:52.725]  And because I was friends with one of the older, well, with a brother who had older brothers who were in college, that's how I, and I looked older.
[00:41:52.745 --> 00:41:56.126]  I tell them I was 13, they never believed it.
[00:41:56.606 --> 00:41:58.507]  The point is, I looked like I was about 16 or 17.
[00:41:59.887 --> 00:42:02.508]  And I rode my little moped over, didn't, you know,
[00:42:04.275 --> 00:42:10.638]  Start up a dirt bike or go grab the neighbor's dirt bike or whatever so my parents would wake up.
[00:42:11.538 --> 00:42:31.427]  And I'd sneak off on the moped, try to cross the golf course rebelliously, and go driving over to the other side of the big neighborhood I grew up in, which was a closed community, you know, had a gated community so you could ride your mopeds there without a license I guess they'd say.
[00:42:32.688 --> 00:42:35.569]  Well, I guess the police didn't enforce it in those days, but I'm already digressing.
[00:42:35.609 --> 00:42:36.449]  I'm going back to it.
[00:42:36.909 --> 00:42:58.516]  And I get there, have a few beers, and there's this blonde-haired preppy guy, college sophomore, and he's kind of picking on some of the high school kids that are there, and there's this really good-looking girl, and I'm talking to her, and he comes up trying to show off and starts being threatening towards her, and I tell him that I'll kick his hind end, and he acts cowardly and slinks off.
[00:42:59.097 --> 00:42:59.917]  Bigger guy than I was.
[00:43:00.635 --> 00:43:10.143]  Well, about ten minutes later, I go in to get another beer out of the refrigerator, and all of a sudden, somebody's got a butcher knife up against my throat so hard, blood's coming out of my throat.
[00:43:11.123 --> 00:43:12.164]  Just little slices.
[00:43:12.605 --> 00:43:17.648]  He's jerking it into my neck so hard that, you know, just the pressure's making me bleed.
[00:43:18.249 --> 00:43:21.011]  And he's got spit dripping out on me.
[00:43:21.431 --> 00:43:27.196]  And I knew to just go limp, and my brain actually split at that point.
[00:43:27.296 --> 00:43:28.177]  It was incredible.
[00:43:29.098 --> 00:43:29.578]  It was like
[00:43:30.495 --> 00:43:33.956]  You know, one side of your brain is the more animalistic, and the other is more scientific.
[00:43:34.196 --> 00:43:37.717]  The scientific part, the cold part, took over, and I just talked real smooth.
[00:43:37.757 --> 00:43:41.157]  I just said, just, uh, just, just let me go.
[00:43:41.697 --> 00:43:42.258]  Everything's alright.
[00:43:42.278 --> 00:43:43.078]  I'm very sorry.
[00:43:43.478 --> 00:43:44.138]  He's going, really?
[00:43:44.378 --> 00:43:44.918]  I'll kill ya!
[00:43:44.938 --> 00:43:45.838]  I wanna kill ya!
[00:43:46.118 --> 00:43:47.799]  And he's jerking the knife into my throat.
[00:43:48.579 --> 00:43:57.721]  And, uh... Basically, he let me go, he put the knife down, and I beat the living daylights out of him.
[00:43:59.494 --> 00:44:05.496]  First I went home, my father got up out of bed, he heard me doing something and I was getting something out of the closet, I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:44:05.516 --> 00:44:06.797]  And he said, what were you doing?
[00:44:07.297 --> 00:44:12.219]  And he stopped me, and then I still ran out of the house and went back over there, and by then they'd locked the door.
[00:44:12.599 --> 00:44:16.841]  I kicked the door down, there were only about ten people there then, and I took a beer bottle to the guy.
[00:44:16.861 --> 00:44:23.103]  But the point is, the point is, that, that, that, that, that experience
[00:44:24.463 --> 00:44:26.605]  Oh, by the way, he later went to prison.
[00:44:26.625 --> 00:44:27.626]  I forgot this part.
[00:44:28.607 --> 00:44:35.954]  The older college guy, whose parents were out of town, got real rude with me and said I ought to call the cops because the door was a big, heavy oak door.
[00:44:36.775 --> 00:44:42.220]  It was all ripped out and the hinges were all... It didn't come off its hinges, but you know where the locks are, busted open.
[00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:44.282]  I just rammed it open.
[00:44:44.722 --> 00:44:45.463]  Probably weighed about 160 pounds.
[00:44:51.283 --> 00:44:52.744]  You know, they all said, that's it, you're horrible.
[00:44:52.764 --> 00:45:11.811]  I was kind of out with that group of people until that older college guy and the same frat guy were at another party in another part of Dallas a few months later and they were just in the kitchen and the guy went crazy with a butcher knife and stabbed three people.
[00:45:12.531 --> 00:45:15.832]  One of them, he even, it got into the heart, but the guy survived.
[00:45:16.133 --> 00:45:18.513]  I mean, viciously stabbing people with a butcher knife.
[00:45:18.714 --> 00:45:19.854]  He was, he was psychopathic.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:33.688]  So the average person would have done the wrong thing and flopped and freaked out and juggler cut, aorta cut, whatever, flopping around, pool of blood, he'd gone to prison then.
[00:45:33.928 --> 00:45:34.929]  But thank God!
[00:45:35.169 --> 00:45:37.030]  That's why I'm also not that afraid of death.
[00:45:37.351 --> 00:45:38.852]  I feel like I cheated death that time.
[00:45:44.617 --> 00:45:46.359]  There's a story I probably shouldn't even tell.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:48.761]  Just because...
[00:45:50.658 --> 00:45:55.219]  I had a crazy friend named Mark and he was driving on this country road and this guy didn't like him cutting him off.
[00:45:55.599 --> 00:45:57.499]  So the guy drives by him and a rifle out the window.
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:03.220]  Unbelievable.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:10.642]  And the guy, so Mark pulls over and jumps out and runs up and starts screaming, shoot me, blah, blah, blah.
[00:46:11.022 --> 00:46:12.362]  And the guy jumps out with a rifle.
[00:46:13.762 --> 00:46:17.103]  And, well I guess we didn't do anything wrong, but the point is the guy
[00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:22.213]  The guy starts beating Mark in the head with the rifle, and Mark's bleeding all over the place.
[00:46:22.273 --> 00:46:25.696]  I mean, I'm lucky to have survived that one.
[00:46:29.219 --> 00:46:35.984]  Then there's a time we'd go buy beer, because you could drive into the worst part off Dolphin Road in Dallas, and they'd sell beer to you when you were 15.
[00:46:36.024 --> 00:46:36.484]  I didn't care.
[00:46:36.964 --> 00:46:40.547]  You'd probably come in there in a stroller, and they'd sell it to you.
[00:46:42.809 --> 00:46:45.611]  Just all the crack dealers and the rest of it, but we wanted beer.
[00:46:46.542 --> 00:46:47.622]  I don't know why I'm telling these stories.
[00:46:47.662 --> 00:46:51.863]  I've got huge Building 7 news, gigantic Silverstein news that just came out.
[00:46:53.324 --> 00:46:57.785]  All I know is, is that it traumatizes a lot of people, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:57.865 --> 00:47:00.525]  I think it made me stronger, the things that happened to me growing up.
[00:47:01.365 --> 00:47:05.566]  It makes me, though, want to literally sit on my children with a lock and key and never let them out of the house.
[00:47:05.586 --> 00:47:08.307]  You know, put them up in a high tower, how bad the world is.
[00:47:08.327 --> 00:47:09.967]  I've got to tell you, Austin's a totally different culture.
[00:47:10.508 --> 00:47:11.548]  I'm blessed to live here.
[00:47:11.608 --> 00:47:12.488]  It isn't this wild,
[00:47:13.385 --> 00:47:15.907]  You know, shoot them up, beat the daylights out of everybody.
[00:47:15.927 --> 00:47:18.229]  I mean, that's how Dallas and surrounding areas are.
[00:47:18.249 --> 00:47:19.550]  Anybody who's grown up there knows that.
[00:47:20.511 --> 00:47:22.392]  I know other areas of the country are the same way.
[00:47:23.453 --> 00:47:25.355]  But it's just scary.
[00:47:25.395 --> 00:47:27.016]  It's dangerous out there for young people.
[00:47:28.457 --> 00:47:29.838]  But I never started a fight.
[00:47:31.119 --> 00:47:32.200]  I never started one, folks.
[00:47:33.501 --> 00:47:40.787]  But I am just so blessed to have survived with only a few concussions and loose teeth and a broken leg.
[00:47:43.413 --> 00:47:44.334]  You know, stuff like that.
[00:47:46.496 --> 00:47:49.498]  But it did always make me stronger.
[00:47:49.718 --> 00:47:53.401]  But let me tell you, people getting stabbed by Mr. Crazy Man.
[00:47:53.421 --> 00:47:56.024]  A few months later I hear, oh yeah, that guy went to jail.
[00:47:56.044 --> 00:47:56.664]  He's crazy.
[00:47:56.944 --> 00:47:58.085]  He stabbed a bunch of people.
[00:47:59.947 --> 00:48:06.452]  And I saw the college student and he got stabbed and it was like a scar all the way down his chest, all the way down.
[00:48:06.492 --> 00:48:07.093]  It was horrible.
[00:48:08.244 --> 00:48:09.665]  It was very good, so he showed it to him.
[00:48:09.685 --> 00:48:10.645]  He's like, I'm real sorry.
[00:48:11.085 --> 00:48:11.866]  Now I see.
[00:48:12.386 --> 00:48:14.187]  See, everything's a joke to people, too.
[00:48:14.207 --> 00:48:15.948]  Glaze over, he put a knife to my throat.
[00:48:16.328 --> 00:48:18.769]  Glaze over, he did all that, until it happens to you.
[00:48:22.891 --> 00:48:26.193]  But thank Jesus, that's the only reason I'm alive.
[00:48:26.293 --> 00:48:37.678]  And that's why when Colonel Craig Roberts comes on, and he was going off to Vietnam, and his old Baptist granddaddy said, when he was a private in the Marine Corps, he told him, listen, you don't worry about it over there, because if it isn't your time to die,
[00:48:38.499 --> 00:48:39.380]  Nothing can take you.
[00:48:43.042 --> 00:48:45.163]  I was also listening to Jack McClellan this weekend.
[00:48:46.184 --> 00:48:48.645]  Driving along and I heard him talking about CPS taking children.
[00:48:49.386 --> 00:48:50.486]  Made me sick at my stomach.
[00:48:51.547 --> 00:48:55.149]  I also heard him talking about his mama, who his daddy wasn't there when he was growing up.
[00:48:55.189 --> 00:49:01.673]  His mama working three jobs to take care of him and his two sisters and that's basically worked herself to death.
[00:49:01.733 --> 00:49:04.675]  And how he hated her and all the things she did to keep him out of trouble.
[00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:05.890]  We're good to go!
[00:49:35.287 --> 00:49:45.390]  It's a great burden to have as much love as women have and as much of the spirit of wanting to take care of people and to minister to people.
[00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:54.373]  That's why people that abuse women and children, every instinct that I have as a man is that, well, I want to take you out.
[00:49:55.953 --> 00:49:57.594]  That's a righteous feeling, by the way.
[00:49:58.674 --> 00:50:04.356]  We have these feelings of violence and anger and strength for a reason to be protectors.
[00:50:05.382 --> 00:50:10.365]  Not to act manly and strut around and go to ultimate fighting contests.
[00:50:11.206 --> 00:50:12.466]  That's all aberrations.
[00:50:13.427 --> 00:50:14.988]  A real man doesn't like violence.
[00:50:15.588 --> 00:50:17.429]  A real man seeks to avoid violence.
[00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:20.511]  The problem is when we're young we don't have wisdom yet.
[00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:23.613]  We don't know how to control these manly instincts that we have.
[00:50:24.794 --> 00:50:25.995]  But those are there for a reason.
[00:50:26.055 --> 00:50:28.036]  It's not to go spin them on a
[00:50:29.241 --> 00:50:29.861]  Football game.
[00:50:29.881 --> 00:50:34.223]  That's why it feels so good to be at a football game and to see them make the touchdown.
[00:50:34.263 --> 00:50:37.504]  Because it's a shadow of the real thing.
[00:50:40.485 --> 00:50:41.645]  That isn't real warfare.
[00:50:42.546 --> 00:50:43.586]  That isn't real combat.
[00:50:45.627 --> 00:50:47.967]  And even these wars picking on third world nations.
[00:50:48.267 --> 00:50:49.688]  It doesn't feel good to the warriors.
[00:50:50.228 --> 00:50:54.470]  The only type of warfare that feels good is protecting your family, protecting your country's borders.
[00:50:56.410 --> 00:50:58.691]  That's why you can't ever take down a nation that's under attack.
[00:50:59.787 --> 00:51:01.409]  Because the people are going to resist you.
[00:51:04.772 --> 00:51:10.257]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.638 --> 00:51:18.265]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.962 --> 00:51:26.025]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.406 --> 00:51:37.831]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.151 --> 00:51:41.693]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.113 --> 00:51:44.054]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.374 --> 00:51:48.216]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:01.556 --> 00:53:03.276]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:03.497 --> 00:53:07.198]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.

[00:54:30.255 --> 00:54:34.398]  Oh, this is not America.
[00:54:35.539 --> 00:54:38.121]  Lots of bills through the season.
[00:54:43.465 --> 00:54:45.187]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:45.267 --> 00:54:47.350]  Next hour I'm going to plug two new sponsors.
[00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:51.855]  I don't have time to do it right now, but I'm going to plug them in a small way now.
[00:54:52.636 --> 00:54:56.701]  We do have Proto-Gro, which I have used and a lot of people have used.
[00:54:57.862 --> 00:55:01.907]  It's just an amazing natural fertilizer that then transmits
[00:55:02.467 --> 00:55:08.710]  The vitamins and minerals that you need into the different vegetables or fruits that you grow.
[00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:12.612]  It's also great with regular houseplants and it's super concentrated.
[00:55:13.113 --> 00:55:14.754]  We'll be telling you more about Proto-Gro.
[00:55:15.514 --> 00:55:18.335]  It's growlikecrazy.com coming up in the next hour.
[00:55:19.616 --> 00:55:21.277]  Also, Interfood is a new sponsor.
[00:55:21.317 --> 00:55:26.780]  I've heard everybody go crazy about this for like two years since Shack Blood's been advertising and they've also been an advertiser on the network.
[00:55:27.877 --> 00:55:28.817]  I finally talked to them.
[00:55:28.837 --> 00:55:33.319]  I learned a couple years ago they tried to get a hold of me to advertise, but they never could get in touch with us.
[00:55:33.599 --> 00:55:37.521]  And I found out that the guy that owns it and runs it is from Austin, friends with George Humphreys.
[00:55:37.541 --> 00:55:39.102]  I talked to George about that.
[00:55:39.182 --> 00:55:40.622]  So they're great patriots.
[00:55:41.143 --> 00:55:44.264]  And it's the best green food that I've found.
[00:55:44.284 --> 00:55:46.445]  And we've bought the stuff at Whole Foods, other brands of it.
[00:55:46.485 --> 00:55:47.245]  They taste weird.
[00:55:47.605 --> 00:55:50.606]  This one tastes really good with orange juice or grape juice.
[00:55:50.646 --> 00:55:53.107]  And I'm going to tell you all about InnerFood as well.
[00:55:53.147 --> 00:55:53.968]  InnerFood Eats.
[00:55:54.928 --> 00:56:02.053]  Right now, I got so busy off reminiscing about just the insane adolescence and teenagerhood that I had.
[00:56:02.073 --> 00:56:03.835]  And believe me, that was only the tip of the iceberg.
[00:56:04.255 --> 00:56:05.376]  And thank God I survived it.
[00:56:05.396 --> 00:56:07.537]  And it really made me think about all that here.
[00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:28.533]  Jack McClann talked about all the wild stuff he did growing up in Washington, D.C.
[00:56:29.314 --> 00:56:33.118]  And I guess growing up on the edge or in big metropolitan cities, I guess they're just different.
[00:56:34.259 --> 00:56:35.980]  At least maybe out west or in the south.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:36.981]  I don't know about up north.
[00:56:37.822 --> 00:56:39.924]  I think I've heard they get pretty wild up there too.
[00:56:40.384 --> 00:56:44.088]  Huge news, ladies and gentlemen, with a teacher staged fake gun attack on kids.
[00:56:44.628 --> 00:56:46.150]  You should get this article out to everybody.
[00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:48.412]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:58.595]  But the mega massive news, Paul Watson's been listening for 30 minutes since he broke this, wondering why I didn't cover it, so now Paul's got him walking in here with the article going, why aren't Alex covering this?
[00:56:58.615 --> 00:57:00.657]  I guess I'm too busy reminiscing.
[00:57:01.017 --> 00:57:04.840]  Yeah, Luke Rodowski told me about this a few weeks ago, and I guess they told him this again?
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:11.985]  And I was going to do an article about this a few weeks ago, but we just never got around to it.
[00:57:12.045 --> 00:57:16.168]  I mean, all the time, major stories are right in front of our face, and we don't even cover it.
[00:57:17.088 --> 00:57:24.069]  And that's why we're supporting Luke Radowsky, that's why I bought him a couple cameras, and why he's an Infowars.com reporter up there, because he's taking action.
[00:57:24.949 --> 00:57:29.830]  And he did talk to Silverstein employees, and they did tell him.
[00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:45.113]  Headline, this is huge news folks, at PrisonBlinded.com, Silverstein warned not to come to work on 9-11, and by the way, this just came out in the Wall Street Journal, over the weekend there was a blurb about this, separately,
[00:57:46.036 --> 00:57:55.139]  As if he was trying to cover this, saying that his wife said, you gotta go to your medical appointment.
[00:57:55.179 --> 00:58:00.661]  It's as if they have all these people surveilled, and Luke had already now tried to get me to talk about this a few weeks ago, and I just forgot about it.
[00:58:01.041 --> 00:58:10.484]  Luke had just in the last week talked about this on radio, and suddenly Silverstein, what on Friday comes out in Wall Street Journal, I've got that in the stack, and puts out his alibi.
[00:58:10.504 --> 00:58:13.645]  This is big.
[00:58:13.665 --> 00:58:14.605]  This is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:16.377 --> 00:58:19.599]  You know what, I need to call Watson and tell him it's in the Wall Street Journal, too.
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:21.520]  But it's kind of an alibi.
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:29.225]  9-11 truth activists say security guards spilled beans while one gets fired for calling in a false bomb threat to frame demonstrators.
[00:58:29.545 --> 00:58:31.766]  Now, they off-camera said they were police officers.
[00:58:32.887 --> 00:58:37.169]  So that, to me, is a bigger... So they were not police, but they were commanding the police.
[00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:38.210]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.624 --> 00:58:46.589]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.609 --> 00:58:46.689]  What?
[00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:47.070]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.866 --> 00:58:59.966]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.627 --> 00:59:01.727]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.407 --> 00:59:03.207]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.968 --> 00:59:04.868]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.888 --> 00:59:09.189]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.709 --> 00:59:13.831]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.111 --> 00:59:15.671]  We got St.
[00:59:15.711 --> 00:59:24.714]  John Hunt coming up to get into the Part 2 interview about his father, the black op commander, CIA section chief in Mexico City.
[00:59:26.434 --> 00:59:32.838]  E. Howard Hunt, head of the Watergate Burglars, head of the Bay of Pigs, head of the overthrow of Ardennes in Guatemala.
[00:59:34.139 --> 00:59:35.060]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:37.301]  And then part two of the interview coming up.
[00:59:37.641 --> 00:59:40.443]  Then Dr. John Breeding will be in studio the last 30 minutes.
[00:59:41.364 --> 00:59:54.392]  New bill they're trying to pass in Texas, and because the statistics are 3% of the times when doctors at hospitals say somebody's crazy and they want them committed, 3% of the time the cops will respond and go get a judge's order.
[00:59:54.693 --> 00:59:55.193]  Which is good.
[00:59:56.072 --> 00:59:58.753]  Because the mental patients are the doctors and the psychiatrists.
[00:59:59.714 --> 01:00:01.975]  And because cops usually don't buy into it.
[01:00:01.995 --> 01:00:09.998]  Well now they want to make it where without a judge, a jury, without anything, even a judge, the doctors or their medical staff can shoot you to the loony bin.
[01:00:12.039 --> 01:00:15.021]  Huge news in Texas and they're doing similar things across the country.
[01:00:15.041 --> 01:00:18.482]  We'll talk about that in the last 30 minutes today.
[01:00:20.423 --> 01:00:23.645]  Right now Silverstein warned not to come to work on 9-11.
[01:00:25.299 --> 01:00:33.269]  9-11 Truth Activists says security guards spill beans while one gets fired for calling in a false bomb threat to frame demonstrators.
[01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:34.291]  That's the report.
[01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:45.118]  New York 9-11 Truth Activist Luke Radowsky claims WTC Complex owner Larry Silverstein and his daughter got a warning on the morning of 9-11 not to come to work that day.
[01:00:45.178 --> 01:00:58.403]  In short, Silverstein's own security guards, Radowsky and his protest group, We Are Change, protested Silverstein outside the new WTC7 building last month and were confronted by Silverstein's security entourage who
[01:00:59.392 --> 01:01:05.913]  Proceeded to harass the group before calling in a fake bomb threat to the NYPD in an attempt to have the demonstrators arrested.
[01:01:06.293 --> 01:01:08.434]  Now, I know Paul just threw this together real fast.
[01:01:08.454 --> 01:01:09.094]  Great job, Paul.
[01:01:09.134 --> 01:01:20.716]  We need to add here, as we always do, we kind of work in progress, that we have the three witnesses that were there, and you can barely hear it on the tape, but we'll just go off the witnesses, saying we're police officers.
[01:01:22.216 --> 01:01:26.717]  And then they call the police, and the cops come and they are taking direction from them.
[01:01:27.182 --> 01:01:29.944]  Because, you know, Silverstein's the big head honcho around there.
[01:01:30.564 --> 01:01:32.105]  And I guess that's how it works in New York City.
[01:01:32.126 --> 01:01:34.287]  The cops just follow what these guys say.
[01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:38.590]  We talked to their private security staff.
[01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:41.372]  We talked to the people who were there with Larry Silverstein on 9-11.
[01:01:41.792 --> 01:01:47.656]  They said he got a phone call telling him not to show up to work, and he called his daughter up, and his daughter also never showed up to work.
[01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:50.178]  Radowsky told the radio show this past weekend.
[01:01:51.539 --> 01:01:53.881]  Obviously, Silverstein arrived later in the day
[01:01:54.722 --> 01:02:07.212]  But the claim that he was given foreknowledge of the accident, of the incident, at the World Trade Center before the first plane had crashed is a bombshell revelation, perhaps even shadowing his infamous pullet comment.
[01:02:09.033 --> 01:02:11.776]  In addition, it has since come to light that one of the F.U.G.
[01:02:11.796 --> 01:02:22.124]  security guards who intimidated We Are Change protesters during his demonstration outside the WTC7 and called in a false bomb threat, and he did, he said, I think he's got a bomb, he's got a bomb, I'm calling the cops.
[01:02:23.105 --> 01:02:23.866]  You're going to go to jail!
[01:02:24.306 --> 01:02:26.208]  Called in a false bomb threat to frame the group.
[01:02:26.568 --> 01:02:29.731]  Has recently fired by Silverstein Properties.
[01:02:31.232 --> 01:02:37.116]  Rodowski is now seeking legal representation to explore a possible lawsuit against the security guard.
[01:02:38.297 --> 01:02:40.679]  Yeah, I mean, look, who knows?
[01:02:40.719 --> 01:02:42.741]  Do what you want, but I think him getting fired is enough.
[01:02:44.822 --> 01:02:46.784]  Just because these are serious people.
[01:02:48.285 --> 01:02:50.627]  Kind of a rule, like you trounce them, but then
[01:02:52.099 --> 01:02:52.359]  I don't know.
[01:02:52.379 --> 01:02:54.942]  I've got a thing about sticking it in them, you know, once they're on the ground.
[01:02:55.582 --> 01:02:59.006]  Radowsky is now seeking legal representation to explore a possible lawsuit.
[01:03:00.287 --> 01:03:01.909]  Because, see, if you sue them, there'll be a counterclaim.
[01:03:01.929 --> 01:03:03.530]  That's my reason for instinctively saying that.
[01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:04.511]  I'm just not reading this.
[01:03:04.571 --> 01:03:05.172]  I've just got this.
[01:03:05.832 --> 01:03:08.595]  I hadn't heard about it before it went on air, but I didn't know Paul would have it out this quick.
[01:03:08.895 --> 01:03:15.562]  Radowsky is now seeking legal representation to explore a possible lawsuit against the Security Guard, who also threatened the activists with 30 days in the hole.
[01:03:16.261 --> 01:03:21.384]  As well as claiming their cell phones were guns, and that, well that was New York cops actually did that.
[01:03:21.404 --> 01:03:24.066]  And when they grabbed the camera and the stuff, so they should get in trouble too.
[01:03:24.086 --> 01:03:26.407]  And that the wires coming out of their bags were bombs.
[01:03:27.047 --> 01:03:31.190]  In-Life PD officer later arrived to investigate the bomb threat, but the protesters were left alone.
[01:03:31.210 --> 01:03:32.871]  They were actually detained for one hour.
[01:03:33.131 --> 01:03:34.792]  They were actually taken into custody.
[01:03:35.392 --> 01:03:39.595]  As it immediately became apparent that the security guard had made a hoax bomb report, a serious crime.
[01:03:40.567 --> 01:03:51.071]  Such knowingly misleading and false information is not only malicious and immoral, but it's also been made illegal under the Anti-Terror Act, Anti-Hoax Act of 2003.
[01:03:51.111 --> 01:03:52.471]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:53.551 --> 01:03:59.674]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.994 --> 01:04:01.934]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.314 --> 01:04:09.937]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.655 --> 01:04:17.698]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.098 --> 01:04:29.563]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.843 --> 01:04:33.364]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.804 --> 01:04:36.005]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.065 --> 01:04:39.907]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.095 --> 01:04:56.116]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:04:56.436 --> 01:05:01.358]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:05:01.618 --> 01:05:05.979]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:15.183]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:05:15.383 --> 01:05:18.984]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:05:19.284 --> 01:05:24.332]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:05:24.613 --> 01:05:31.363]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:05:31.844 --> 01:05:32.385]  What about you?
[01:05:33.141 --> 01:05:38.483]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:05:53.095 --> 01:05:56.037]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:05:56.197 --> 01:06:01.421]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:06:01.721 --> 01:06:07.065]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:06:07.425 --> 01:06:08.546]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:08.906 --> 01:06:17.792]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:06:18.232 --> 01:06:19.834]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.
[01:06:20.074 --> 01:06:24.238]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[01:06:47.992 --> 01:06:48.232]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.031 --> 01:07:00.092]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.812 --> 01:07:01.933]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.573 --> 01:07:03.414]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.134 --> 01:07:05.675]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.715 --> 01:07:09.658]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.898 --> 01:07:14.020]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.241 --> 01:07:18.563]  Well, it's a huge news Monday, let me tell you.
[01:07:18.803 --> 01:07:21.885]  They've done brainwashing torture drills.
[01:07:22.945 --> 01:07:24.446]  In Murfreesboro, Tennessee.
[01:07:24.846 --> 01:07:25.666]  USA Today.
[01:07:26.326 --> 01:07:28.347]  Teacher staged fake gun attack on children.
[01:07:28.427 --> 01:07:29.968]  Don't tell them that it's a drill.
[01:07:30.348 --> 01:07:31.228]  Turn the lights off.
[01:07:31.268 --> 01:07:33.069]  Tell them that they were basically going to be killed.
[01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:35.830]  Had a guy in a mask going around to terrorize them.
[01:07:36.290 --> 01:07:37.891]  That is classic torture.
[01:07:38.811 --> 01:07:41.272]  Right out of the CIA files.
[01:07:41.912 --> 01:07:43.293]  That's Scales Elementary.
[01:07:44.253 --> 01:07:45.814]  And that is Murfreesboro.
[01:07:45.934 --> 01:07:46.694]  And that's the release.
[01:07:46.714 --> 01:07:48.134]  It's all part of federal funding.
[01:07:48.775 --> 01:07:49.995]  Silverstein, the claim.
[01:07:50.015 --> 01:07:51.416]  Warned not to come into work on 9-11.
[01:07:53.797 --> 01:08:04.386]  And that dovetails with the Wall Street Journal reporting the same thing, which again was in my stack, but they give his alibi, which he suddenly wants to go give the Wall Street Journal a headline article about.
[01:08:05.007 --> 01:08:05.988]  Oh, headline!
[01:08:06.268 --> 01:08:07.989]  Why he didn't go to work that day?
[01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:09.631]  We just want you to know!
[01:08:11.622 --> 01:08:13.103]  There's no doubt they're surveilling us.
[01:08:13.143 --> 01:08:17.725]  I talked to Luke about that conversation two weeks ago and I guess he talked to more security guards and they repeated it.
[01:08:17.945 --> 01:08:22.267]  We're going to get a hold of Luke and get him on if we can to vet more of this out.
[01:08:22.607 --> 01:08:25.748]  But very important article up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:08:26.109 --> 01:08:28.189]  I cannot stress how important all these articles are.
[01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:32.691]  New WTC footage reignites BBC Building 7 controversy.
[01:08:32.932 --> 01:08:35.453]  How they reported that Building 7 had fallen before it had fallen.
[01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:37.594]  We'll get to that later.
[01:08:38.294 --> 01:08:40.255]  But for the next hour and 15 minutes or so,
[01:08:41.676 --> 01:08:44.018]  We're going to talk for about 15-20 minutes, then we're going to take your calls.
[01:08:44.058 --> 01:08:51.704]  But listen, I want to talk about the JFK assassination, or Bay of Pigs, or you can talk about the plumbers if you'd like.
[01:08:52.284 --> 01:08:53.425]  But really, JFK.
[01:08:54.005 --> 01:09:00.310]  And usually I say it's open phones, but on this subject, I'm telling you it's topic specific.
[01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:03.733]  We've got him on, he's gracious enough to give us this time.
[01:09:04.553 --> 01:09:05.174]  He's St.
[01:09:05.194 --> 01:09:07.495]  John Hunt, the oldest son of E. Howard Hunt.
[01:09:07.836 --> 01:09:10.718]  He was the CIA Section Chief in Mexico.
[01:09:11.935 --> 01:09:13.778]  And that was also for surrounding countries.
[01:09:13.798 --> 01:09:16.402]  They didn't have section chiefs in every Latin American nation.
[01:09:17.564 --> 01:09:19.627]  He was the head of the Bay of Pigs op.
[01:09:20.781 --> 01:09:34.244]  He was the head of overthrowing Ardennes successfully, the 1954 coup in Guatemala, taking cues from Kermit Roosevelt, the black op, of course, overthrowing Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran.
[01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:36.504]  He was involved in overthrowing several other nations.
[01:09:37.044 --> 01:09:39.805]  He was a black op commander, of course.
[01:09:39.845 --> 01:09:44.666]  I didn't mention this last time, and it's admitted in Mission Impossible from the TV show Mission Impossible.
[01:09:45.226 --> 01:09:47.731]  From the 60's, that's about E. Howard Hunt.
[01:09:48.092 --> 01:09:49.615]  That's why it's called Ethan Hunt.
[01:09:49.875 --> 01:09:50.477]  E. Hunt.
[01:09:51.364 --> 01:09:53.725]  And, of course, the writers of the original show admitted that later.
[01:09:53.765 --> 01:09:55.206]  That's E. Howard Hunt, folks.
[01:09:55.246 --> 01:09:59.908]  He's supposed to be the gray-haired guy in there who's commanding the people.
[01:09:59.968 --> 01:10:00.949]  That's E. Howard Hunt.
[01:10:01.549 --> 01:10:03.830]  And so he literally ran hundreds of operations.
[01:10:04.230 --> 01:10:10.593]  He's known for basically the Bay of Pigs, but they weren't given their air cover.
[01:10:11.114 --> 01:10:14.455]  And then, of course, he's known for, oh, he screwed up with the Plumbers.
[01:10:14.495 --> 01:10:16.196]  No, that was the Cubans over and over again.
[01:10:16.496 --> 01:10:17.477]  Just getting confident.
[01:10:17.977 --> 01:10:20.258]  But he's not known for all his major successes.
[01:10:20.838 --> 01:10:22.279]  Which I'm not defending those successes.
[01:10:22.299 --> 01:10:23.979]  The point is, this is the guy.
[01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:31.802]  This is Mr. Mission Impossible, and here is his son, which I didn't add, and he's such a gentleman he didn't point it out, hidden on his website.
[01:10:31.822 --> 01:10:34.603]  I'm gonna make sure a link's put up to this today.
[01:10:34.643 --> 01:10:38.705]  I told my webmaster too, I think it's up there now on Infowars.com, that he has a video out.
[01:10:39.742 --> 01:10:41.862]  Which is very historical and very well done.
[01:10:41.882 --> 01:10:44.703]  A little presentation that St.
[01:10:44.743 --> 01:10:48.163]  John Hunt does that all of you need to get while it's still available.
[01:10:48.203 --> 01:10:50.264]  Who knows what could happen or what could develop.
[01:10:50.284 --> 01:10:51.884]  You need to get this for your library.
[01:10:52.564 --> 01:10:57.705]  And that's at his website, stjohnhunt.com.
[01:10:58.485 --> 01:10:59.045]  And St.
[01:10:59.085 --> 01:11:00.946]  John, thank you so much for coming on with us, sir.
[01:11:01.466 --> 01:11:03.306]  Alex, thank you very much for having me back again.
[01:11:03.786 --> 01:11:04.126]  You bet.
[01:11:04.166 --> 01:11:08.267]  First off, just out of the gate, tell us about the presentation video you did and how people get it.
[01:11:09.213 --> 01:11:20.487]  Well, you can go to my website, as you mentioned, stjohnhunt.com, and there will be a prompt there that you can order a DVD.
[01:11:20.567 --> 01:11:28.577]  I've got a DVD that I had produced just a few weeks ago, actually, maybe a month ago.
[01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:46.923]  It's an interview, it's about a little over an hour long in its length, and what I speak about on the DVD are the most important elements of the information that my father gave to me before he passed away regarding the JFK assassination.
[01:11:47.023 --> 01:11:53.427]  How I came about that information, what the study was, why he told me, when he told me,
[01:11:56.468 --> 01:12:14.516]  I show the handwritten memos that my dad wrote to me outlining his participation and his knowledge in that operation that, well, I guess eventually resulted in the removal of a president and the ushering in of a new era in government.
[01:12:17.677 --> 01:12:18.798]  How do folks get the video?
[01:12:18.818 --> 01:12:19.558]  They're on the website.
[01:12:21.730 --> 01:12:27.975]  Well, I think if you scroll down, I think it says New DVD and then it says Dreamland Productions.
[01:12:28.215 --> 01:12:30.156]  I believe I'm not looking at my website right now.
[01:12:30.196 --> 01:12:31.657]  I'm not where a computer is.
[01:12:33.446 --> 01:12:36.709]  If you go to stjohnhunt.com, I think it's sort of self-evident there.
[01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.850]  Absolutely.
[01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:41.133]  In fact, I'm on the website right now, stjohnhunt.com.
[01:12:41.193 --> 01:12:45.757]  I just wanted to get that out for people who wanted that information and who want to get the DVD.
[01:12:46.057 --> 01:12:46.618]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:12:46.938 --> 01:12:52.202]  Now, last time we covered how your father was involved in the Kennedy assassination.
[01:12:52.222 --> 01:12:53.483]  I was just talking to you during the break.
[01:12:54.931 --> 01:12:55.532]  I think so.
[01:13:17.287 --> 01:13:22.628]  I mean, and only up to Vice President LBJ and that Nixon isn't involved.
[01:13:22.688 --> 01:13:28.049]  No, you're just putting out what your father said, what he knew, in his compartmentalization.
[01:13:28.729 --> 01:13:31.910]  Certainly, you're not saying that there weren't other groups higher up involved.
[01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:33.890]  Well, yeah, certainly not.
[01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:41.251]  And I'm certainly not saying that there weren't other assassination plots that may have even been in motion at the same time as this one.
[01:13:41.491 --> 01:13:44.072]  I think it's well documented that there were a lot of
[01:13:44.838 --> 01:13:47.860]  Factions that wanted the removal of President Kennedy.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:57.285]  You know, some of the more classic ones are the Mafia plots and that sort of thing.
[01:13:58.565 --> 01:14:08.851]  So in my opinion, and this is my opinion, from what my father told me, he didn't say that this was the only plot that was up and working.
[01:14:09.891 --> 01:14:12.853]  And my father certainly on the tape says that
[01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:15.250]  I don't think so.
[01:14:28.806 --> 01:14:45.924]  It was in Miami and elsewhere, so that gives me an indication that there was other places where this could have been carried out and perhaps where other teams may have been stationed to carry this out had the one in Dallas not worked.
[01:14:46.829 --> 01:14:54.560]  Well, in fact, from the JFK researchers that have been vetted and really done their research, we know there were more hit teams down the route.
[01:14:54.841 --> 01:14:56.023]  I mean, they weren't going to stop.
[01:14:56.263 --> 01:14:56.964]  They were going to get him.
[01:14:57.445 --> 01:14:58.907]  Yeah, yeah, I agree with that.
[01:15:00.442 --> 01:15:03.964]  And of course the government always, you know, why buy one when you can buy five?
[01:15:04.025 --> 01:15:05.646]  Or, you know, buy two as they say.
[01:15:05.986 --> 01:15:08.207]  Of course they had other operations going.
[01:15:08.527 --> 01:15:14.271]  And I guarantee you they had other Patsy Ops going in case things went wrong, they were going to hang other groups out to dry.
[01:15:14.291 --> 01:15:17.493]  I mean, that's synonymous with black ops.
[01:15:17.733 --> 01:15:19.435]  That is classic standard procedure.
[01:15:19.475 --> 01:15:22.757]  You always have a plan B and a plan C in place.
[01:15:23.607 --> 01:15:24.168]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:15:39.814 --> 01:15:44.556]  Uh, you know, properly than he was in a position to move Plan B into.
[01:15:45.096 --> 01:15:52.480]  Well, we know that the black-off arm of the Pentagon that Colonel Fletcher Prouty would have been over, but he was sent to the pole.
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:54.981]  We know that they even had soldiers in the air.
[01:15:55.021 --> 01:15:56.601]  I mean, there's no telling what they were planning.
[01:15:56.981 --> 01:15:57.442]  That's right.
[01:15:57.722 --> 01:15:58.082]  That's right.
[01:15:58.102 --> 01:15:59.222]  It was a huge...
[01:16:01.185 --> 01:16:13.911]  A huge conspiracy, but it wasn't necessarily that there was a huge amount of people involved in the conspiracy, because if you have just a few key people in the right places... Yeah, compartmentalization.
[01:16:14.071 --> 01:16:15.832]  Yeah, compartmentalization, absolutely.
[01:16:15.872 --> 01:16:20.794]  That's the standard procedure in that kind of intelligence community.
[01:16:21.595 --> 01:16:22.095]  Need to know.
[01:16:23.315 --> 01:16:24.476]  And were you going to say something else?
[01:16:24.516 --> 01:16:25.216]  I interrupted you.
[01:16:26.117 --> 01:16:27.037]  I was just going to say that
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:37.064]  Uh... that there may have been uh... you know not as many people as some people theorize involved.
[01:16:37.124 --> 01:16:43.048]  I mean, you know, some people speculate, oh well you would have to have hundreds of people involved in this conspiracy.
[01:16:43.148 --> 01:16:44.389]  It just would never have been possible.
[01:16:44.409 --> 01:16:46.030]  But that's just not true.
[01:16:46.090 --> 01:16:52.353]  You have a few key people in positions of control, in positions of authority, and you can make a lot of things happen.
[01:16:54.154 --> 01:16:54.935]  Absolutely.
[01:16:55.915 --> 01:16:56.696]  Getting into
[01:16:58.450 --> 01:17:06.575]  There was a lawsuit with your father against the Liberty Lobby a long time ago when they said that me, Howard Hunt, had been one of the tramps.
[01:17:07.156 --> 01:17:12.399]  Now, clearly, there's a photo that woke you up that you saw hanging on that telephone pole that time you were in that phone booth.
[01:17:12.839 --> 01:17:13.200]  Yeah.
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:17.222]  But, you know, as you pointed out to me during the break, that suit was lost.
[01:17:18.043 --> 01:17:18.523]  Yes.
[01:17:18.723 --> 01:17:21.205]  Well, he lost that suit.
[01:17:21.825 --> 01:17:26.188]  Apparently, he won the initial judgment and on appeal.
[01:17:27.078 --> 01:17:28.419]  He lost the appeal decision.
[01:17:28.479 --> 01:17:36.462]  Now, Mark Lane handled the defense of Liberty Lobby in that second trial, and he wrote a book called Plausible Denial.
[01:17:37.723 --> 01:17:39.284]  There was some testimony.
[01:17:39.384 --> 01:17:47.447]  I mean, they had a lot of circumstantial evidence linking my father to his role.
[01:17:47.467 --> 01:17:53.370]  Now, of course, if your father didn't sue, the CIA would know he wasn't being loyal and would probably have eliminated him.
[01:17:54.139 --> 01:18:15.751]  Yeah, you know, he had signed, you know, of course, the standard, you know, secrecy agreements that all intelligence operatives have to sign, so he was treading a very fine line there, you know, how can you sue, you know, how can you call the government as a witness to your, you know, to your whereabouts if you can't, you know, if you can't list them, you know, officially as
[01:18:17.038 --> 01:18:20.299]  You know, in whatever capacity you were working for them for.
[01:18:20.459 --> 01:18:25.800]  So, you know, he was kind of out on a limb there and he lost that lawsuit.
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:26.981]  It cost him a great deal.
[01:18:27.561 --> 01:18:31.642]  And they had witnesses that placed him in Dallas on that day.
[01:18:32.862 --> 01:18:34.903]  Some were credible and some weren't so credible.
[01:18:34.963 --> 01:18:38.364]  But, you know, I've had... But now it doesn't matter because he went public.
[01:18:38.884 --> 01:18:40.364]  And we have his son, St.
[01:18:40.404 --> 01:18:41.284]  John Hunt, on with us.
[01:18:41.304 --> 01:18:43.045]  When we come back, I want to talk about where you were.
[01:18:43.923 --> 01:18:51.990]  On that fateful day in 1963, some of the other little stories that are just amazing about different things you witnessed growing up in the Hunt household.
[01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:53.051]  And then your calls.
[01:18:53.791 --> 01:18:54.772]  How are you feeling today?

[01:19:53.303 --> 01:19:59.505]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:19:59.965 --> 01:20:07.747]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:20:08.087 --> 01:20:15.929]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:20:16.249 --> 01:20:21.012]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:20:21.332 --> 01:20:26.055]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:30.418]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:20:30.918 --> 01:20:31.939]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:22:57.602 --> 01:23:02.405]  What would you do if you knew you are the things we knew?
[01:23:02.445 --> 01:23:03.426]  Would you stand up?
[01:23:03.466 --> 01:23:03.966]  Would you?
[01:23:04.006 --> 01:23:06.448]  Would you turn away too?
[01:23:06.808 --> 01:23:11.372]  And what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:13.953]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[01:23:14.574 --> 01:23:17.676]  Or would you turn and walk away?
[01:23:17.756 --> 01:23:21.519]  What would you do if you knew you are the things we knew?
[01:23:26.488 --> 01:23:26.708]  St.
[01:23:26.748 --> 01:23:40.460]  John Hunt, the eldest son of E. Howard Hunt, the spymaster, now admittedly involved in a support capacity, in his words, with the JFK assassination back in 1963, now almost 44 years ago.
[01:23:44.458 --> 01:23:45.941]  And going back to St.
[01:23:45.981 --> 01:23:50.549]  John Hunt, who has the website stjohnhunt.com, St.
[01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:55.619]  John, before we get into some of the things that happened in your youth, helping your dad one time clean off spy equipment,
[01:23:56.595 --> 01:23:57.096]  I don't
[01:24:27.075 --> 01:24:30.176]  But that was 1963.
[01:24:30.236 --> 01:24:31.216]  I was in 5th grade.
[01:24:31.296 --> 01:24:32.876]  I was at Brookmont Elementary School.
[01:24:33.477 --> 01:24:41.858]  So I have a vivid recollection of, and I think most people that were at least, you know, 8, 9, 10 years old recall the events of that day.
[01:24:41.878 --> 01:24:43.639]  President Kennedy has been shot!
[01:24:43.959 --> 01:24:54.321]  Yeah, and school was closed and we were sent home where I waited with the, you know, in my house with my mother for
[01:24:55.626 --> 01:24:57.367]  You know, for what to do next.
[01:24:57.447 --> 01:25:16.100]  You know, you sort of just sit around and watch the TV, but as far as my father, you know, going to a Chinese grocery store and picking up ingredients for a home-cooked Chinese meal and chopping bok choy in the kitchen and having dinner with his children and watching television, I just don't, that's not my recollection.
[01:25:16.636 --> 01:25:21.959]  Well, everybody I know, my mother, my uncle, my dad, they all remember exactly where they were when it happened.
[01:25:22.419 --> 01:25:24.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:37.007]  And that was the key weak point in the trial at Liberty Lobby where once Mark Lane got my father on the witness stand and hammered away at his alibi.
[01:25:37.027 --> 01:25:40.569]  It just crumbled, changed several times, and it's never been
[01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:45.992]  You know, established beyond any beyond reasonable doubt as to where he was.
[01:25:46.252 --> 01:25:58.077]  He had 11 or 11 or 16 hour, maybe it was 11 hour sick sick leave that day or the day before from from the CIA that he took.
[01:25:58.357 --> 01:26:06.180]  So, you know, in 11 to 16 hour period, I don't know what, you know, I can only speculate what you know what he could have done.
[01:26:06.801 --> 01:26:09.083]  Well, something sick definitely was happening.
[01:26:09.583 --> 01:26:21.233]  Now, many years later, I guess, or a few years later, you were a little bit older and your dad arrived one evening and wasn't his normal gentlemanly or well-kept demeanor.
[01:26:21.273 --> 01:26:25.016]  What happened in conjunction with you helping him clean up some equipment?
[01:26:25.576 --> 01:26:31.201]  Well, that was the night of the DNC break-in when my dad's Cuban
[01:26:32.156 --> 01:26:33.457]  We're good to go.
[01:27:01.553 --> 01:27:02.014]  I think so.
[01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:13.854]  I threw some clothes on and ran upstairs.
[01:27:14.494 --> 01:27:16.255]  I knew there was something terribly, terribly wrong.
[01:27:16.295 --> 01:27:18.896]  My father, I'd never seen him lose his composure before.
[01:27:19.696 --> 01:27:24.538]  He was clearly lost all his composure.
[01:27:24.578 --> 01:27:30.780]  He was frantically moving things around, trying to make phone calls, changing his clothes.
[01:27:31.301 --> 01:27:32.041]  I went up there and he
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:41.423]  And he said, uh, open up that suitcase on the bed and I need you to go into the kitchen, get some, uh, get some dishwashing gloves, some Windex and roll of paper towels.
[01:27:41.623 --> 01:27:47.105]  And I need you to come back here and I need you to wipe down everything inside and the entire suitcase.
[01:27:47.785 --> 01:27:50.266]  Put those gloves on and just start working at that right away.
[01:27:50.306 --> 01:27:51.326]  Don't ask me any questions.
[01:27:52.166 --> 01:27:59.709]  And he went and took a quick shower and I, uh, I sat in that room for 45 minutes, uh, and, uh, and I wiped, uh, all, uh,
[01:28:00.157 --> 01:28:12.800]  Yeah, all manner of stuff down, wires, little boxes, walkie-talkies, microphones, various stainless steel poles, tripod things.
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:22.662]  And then when I had it all done, we wiped the entire suitcase off on the outside and he said, okay, let's load that up in the car.
[01:28:22.702 --> 01:28:23.582]  We threw it in the back of his
[01:28:24.486 --> 01:28:31.490]  of his Green Firebird and drove it out to the Canal Locks out River Road in Potomac, Maryland and we tossed it in the water.
[01:28:32.811 --> 01:28:34.411]  Stay there, stay there my friend.
[01:28:34.431 --> 01:28:35.412]  We're going to be right back.
[01:28:35.872 --> 01:28:37.053]  Just an absolutely amazing story.
[01:28:37.073 --> 01:28:39.574]  I want you to finish that up and we're going to open the phones up.
[01:28:40.255 --> 01:28:40.795]  Straight ahead.

[01:29:05.770 --> 01:29:09.850]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:18.972]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.

[01:31:07.263 --> 01:31:08.444]  War in Iran?

[01:31:11.407 --> 01:31:16.691]  In the first issue is included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.

[01:32:04.489 --> 01:32:26.668]  John Hunt, son of E. Howard Hunt, who's now released a tape and written pages before he died to his son, has gone public with them about what experts had known for close to 40 years that E. Howard Hunt was in the catbird seat running much of that operation as he had done many other
[01:32:27.478 --> 01:32:30.679]  serious operations overthrowing other leaders around the world.
[01:32:30.699 --> 01:32:38.183]  That's what E. Howard Hunt did, hence Mission Impossible Ethan Hunt in the television show and movies after his father.
[01:32:38.203 --> 01:32:45.045]  Before we go to BL, Richard, David and Century and many others that are holding, I want to tell you about a great new sponsor.
[01:32:45.486 --> 01:32:46.226]  It's ProtoGro.
[01:32:46.266 --> 01:32:47.607]  What do I say about this stuff?
[01:32:48.627 --> 01:32:55.730]  I've been reading about ProtoGro, using ProtoGro, seeing others use ProtoGro for now over a year.
[01:32:57.737 --> 01:33:14.498]  I vet my sponsors that I plug here on the radio and it is concentrated sea nutrients and minerals which have been depleted from the land because it's all been running off the land not just from agriculture but naturally that's why the ocean is salty and filled with all those minerals
[01:33:15.732 --> 01:33:18.334]  And just the research involved in all of it.
[01:33:18.394 --> 01:33:19.615]  It is so amazing.
[01:33:20.236 --> 01:33:21.297]  And it's a really good price.
[01:33:21.317 --> 01:33:25.720]  You try to buy comparable, you know, so-called seed-based stuff.
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:28.702]  It's a lot more in many of the stores I've seen.
[01:33:30.444 --> 01:33:33.606]  And most importantly, they support this show and their patriots.
[01:33:33.706 --> 01:33:34.447]  Proto-Grove.
[01:33:34.467 --> 01:33:39.911]  I just want to give attention to all the gardeners, but also people who just have houseplants and never wanted to grow
[01:33:40.743 --> 01:33:41.364]  We're good to go.
[01:33:56.767 --> 01:33:57.568]  It's just amazing.
[01:33:57.608 --> 01:34:02.171]  It's dynamite on fruits and vegetables and on almost any flower you can think of.
[01:34:02.651 --> 01:34:03.592]  Even your wheat grass.
[01:34:03.752 --> 01:34:07.915]  Literally, any plant will not only flourish, but grow like crazy.
[01:34:08.536 --> 01:34:11.918]  Like you never thought possible with this new super food for plants.
[01:34:12.779 --> 01:34:15.881]  And I mean, you put Miracle-Gro and stuff on things.
[01:34:15.901 --> 01:34:16.582]  That's a chemical.
[01:34:16.662 --> 01:34:17.943]  And then you end up just eating that.
[01:34:18.643 --> 01:34:20.525]  This is all natural, folks, and that's the key.
[01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:27.585]  If you want tastier, larger, and all-around healthier plants, I cannot recommend to you a better product than Proto-Gro.
[01:34:27.965 --> 01:34:37.232]  Forget everything else you think you know about what fresh fruits and vegetables taste like, and call the folks at Proto-Gro at 1-877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, and use extension PG202 with your order.
[01:34:50.665 --> 01:34:50.845]  877-327-0367.
[01:34:51.266 --> 01:35:04.575]  Use extension PG202 with your order or visit them on the web for more information at growlikecrazy.com and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:35:05.339 --> 01:35:13.326]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, 877-327-0365 or simply go to GrowLikeCrazy.com.
[01:35:13.346 --> 01:35:15.567]  We also have banners on JonesReport.com.
[01:35:15.587 --> 01:35:20.311]  That's right at the top of JonesReport.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and InfoWars.com.
[01:35:20.631 --> 01:35:21.912]  Proto-Grow, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:23.914 --> 01:35:26.916]  And a brief plug for my films and books and materials.
[01:35:26.956 --> 01:35:31.160]  We have a secure online video on books for a shopping cart at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:31.795 --> 01:35:33.775]  And that's how we support and run our operation here.
[01:35:33.796 --> 01:35:34.956]  That's the main source of funding.
[01:35:35.296 --> 01:35:45.118]  Plus, there are great films that wake you up to the New World War, the different crimes they commit, the black op government, the shadow government that even USA Today and Washington Post admitted on Friday are running everything.
[01:35:46.459 --> 01:35:48.419]  Pretty much my job's gotten a little bit easier, folks.
[01:35:48.459 --> 01:35:50.380]  It's kind of all out in the open, but now what do we do?
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:53.700]  We educate the rest of the dumbbell population that isn't awake yet.
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:56.401]  That's the number one solution to our fight.
[01:35:57.302 --> 01:36:24.541]  uh... here and uh... terror storm the first edition will be gone soon we're selling out of it quickly there's a little bit of a left here amazon dot com has some discounted down to what twelve bucks a copy and uh... it's over three hours on the dvd a history of government-sponsored terrorism terror storm and uh... when they're gone they're gone that will be it for terror storm first edition second edition comes out in late july
[01:36:26.295 --> 01:36:29.517]  And see it also as a way of supporting us, as I said, when you get Terror Storm.
[01:36:30.318 --> 01:36:34.080]  But if you want the collector's item, the original copy, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:37.382]  Every copy sold out of this office is going to be signed.
[01:36:37.502 --> 01:36:39.223]  I just put myself in for a nightmare there.
[01:36:39.243 --> 01:36:44.006]  What I'm going to do is print a little card that's signed and put it in with that.
[01:36:44.747 --> 01:36:50.371]  Because I don't want to try to rip the packaging off each one of these, the shrink wrap, and pull the sleeve out and sign that.
[01:36:50.391 --> 01:36:55.494]  So we'll print up, I think we've got like 700 left, we'll print up the cards and I'll sign those.
[01:36:56.648 --> 01:37:05.320]  And for everybody that orders one from TerrorStorm, a TerrorStorm from InfoWars.com, I cannot sign the ones that are on Amazon.
[01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:06.282]  That's in their warehouse.
[01:37:06.722 --> 01:37:10.347]  Less than a thousand left there, but I do want to get these out to you.
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:12.021]  We need to add that.
[01:37:12.041 --> 01:37:16.285]  I guess the shopping cart that you will be getting a signed copy as well when you order via InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:16.325 --> 01:37:19.549]  You can also write to us at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:37:19.849 --> 01:37:23.032]  There, I've just put myself into quite a position to say I'll sign all those, but I will.
[01:37:35.326 --> 01:37:36.986]  I've actually got my hand tired before doing it.
[01:37:37.546 --> 01:37:39.567]  But people like that, so that means he gets the truth out.
[01:37:39.607 --> 01:37:40.147]  Hey, I'll do it.
[01:37:40.187 --> 01:37:41.667]  I'll knock my head up against a brick wall.
[01:37:42.907 --> 01:37:53.249]  So again, if you want a signed copy of First Edition Terror Storm, a real collector's item, that is available right now on InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:56.590]  Alright, going back to St.
[01:37:56.610 --> 01:38:02.891]  John Hunt, son of Spymaster, Section Chief Commander, Black Ops Commander E. Howard Hunt.
[01:38:04.408 --> 01:38:08.513]  One more question before we go to BL and Richard and David and Century and everybody else.
[01:38:09.093 --> 01:38:18.884]  Kennedy, growing up in a household later, did you ever hear comments about Kennedy or being around your father and other CIA or other black ops people?
[01:38:19.484 --> 01:38:40.232]  Defense Intelligence, other folks that dropped by, I mean any other things you haven't talked about or that you have talked about that you haven't elaborated on, any caveats or addendums or key pieces of info, just about what they thought of Kennedy or did you ever ask your father before he went public to you or just any other little tidbits.
[01:38:41.173 --> 01:38:52.202]  Well, growing up in a household with my father, as a child you grow up sort of becoming a little version of what your parents are.
[01:38:52.222 --> 01:38:59.068]  It was well known in our family household that Kennedy was a hated persona.
[01:39:01.410 --> 01:39:08.836]  It was interesting because for a time I went to the same private Catholic school that the Kennedy children went to.
[01:39:09.582 --> 01:39:30.239]  So that was always a source of fascination and amusement as well as some irritation to my parents because the Kennedy kids would be dropped off from their limo and we would be dropped off in our vehicles and we'd sort of brush shoulders with Caroline Kennedy.
[01:39:32.566 --> 01:39:41.329]  And, uh, you know, I hated her dad and didn't really know at the time why I hated her dad, but I found out later, you know, why the, why the animosity ran so deeply.
[01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:42.750]  What kind of things were said?
[01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:44.150]  I mean, just without any profanity.
[01:39:44.971 --> 01:39:45.791]  I mean, just an example.
[01:39:46.671 --> 01:39:54.174]  Well, um, um, just, just that, um, I mean, not to imply that your dad was using profanity.
[01:39:54.194 --> 01:39:56.415]  He was quite genteel, I know, but, but, but please.
[01:39:56.995 --> 01:40:01.257]  Well, actually he, he, he was a man with, uh, you know, he could, he could, uh,
[01:40:01.638 --> 01:40:09.420]  He could traverse both ends of the vocabulary spectrum, so it wasn't uncommon to hear him use profanity sometimes.
[01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:18.283]  One of the things he liked to say around the house was, let's finish the job, let's hit Ted.
[01:40:20.465 --> 01:40:24.427]  That's something I've never revealed before, and it doesn't really speak very well to my mind.
[01:40:24.447 --> 01:40:24.727]  Oh my God!
[01:40:25.048 --> 01:40:28.990]  Your dad would say, let's finish the job, let's hit Ted.
[01:40:29.210 --> 01:40:30.291]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:30.351 --> 01:40:33.312]  I mean, I know you said it, but elaborate.
[01:40:33.352 --> 01:40:34.413]  I mean, what context?
[01:40:35.133 --> 01:40:47.340]  Well, in the context that, you know, JFK had already been removed, RFK was gone, and, you know, his motto was, let's finish the job, let's hit Ted.
[01:40:47.797 --> 01:40:48.077]  I don't know.
[01:41:01.983 --> 01:41:09.887]  He'd driven the car off the bridge at Chappaquiddick with Mary Jo Kopechny in the back seat, who drowned in that terrible tragedy.
[01:41:09.907 --> 01:41:11.668]  So there was a real hatred of the Kennedys.
[01:41:11.748 --> 01:41:24.956]  I mean, he'd be around the house and he'd just see Ted Kennedy on TV or... Yeah, oh yeah, he'd see Ted Kennedy on TV or read something about him in the paper and he would smirk, you know, and go, let's... we should finish the job and hit Ted.
[01:41:25.696 --> 01:41:30.539]  So, you know, I mean, that's everybody's... Oh my God, and that's brand new info.
[01:41:31.149 --> 01:41:35.053]  Yeah, I mean, you know, it's not the most savory piece of information.
[01:41:35.093 --> 01:41:37.516]  I don't like to make my dad look like he was, you know.
[01:41:37.776 --> 01:41:42.582]  I know, but it's so important to shatter the whole JFK myth because everything else is built on that.
[01:41:42.862 --> 01:41:43.763]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:41:44.464 --> 01:41:44.704]  Yeah.
[01:41:45.785 --> 01:41:49.930]  But, you know, and he had a lot of, you know, when his Cuban friends would come over and
[01:41:50.609 --> 01:41:55.051]  You know, our teammate would be there, Manuel Arquime, who was to have been the next president of Cuba.
[01:41:56.612 --> 01:42:08.758]  He would come over for dinner and we'd, you know, try to keep politics out of the conversation, but it would always drift into, you know, what could we do, you know, what could be done with this country, you know.
[01:42:09.478 --> 01:42:10.139]  That kind of thing.
[01:42:10.239 --> 01:42:11.399]  Anti-Kennedy rhetoric.
[01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:16.482]  Now, when did they finally admit to you that, hey, Daddy's CIA?
[01:42:17.182 --> 01:42:17.522]  When I was 16.
[01:42:20.321 --> 01:42:25.543]  Let's see, I was 20 and 74, so I was 18 and 72 when Watergate happened.
[01:42:25.623 --> 01:42:27.884]  Had you already had your own suspicions?
[01:42:28.765 --> 01:42:30.906]  Well, no, I really had no idea.
[01:42:30.926 --> 01:42:37.468]  The cover story was that he worked for the State Department, and so that's why we traveled so much.
[01:42:37.588 --> 01:42:43.931]  But when I was 16, they thought that I was mature enough to be able to
[01:42:44.770 --> 01:42:48.352]  To be told the truth, as long as I didn't mention it to any of my friends.
[01:42:48.532 --> 01:42:51.054]  So that's when they told me I was 16.
[01:42:52.394 --> 01:42:58.158]  Now, did he start making the let's hit Ted and finish the job comments after that, or was he just making these out of the blue before that?
[01:43:00.599 --> 01:43:01.499]  It was sometime later.
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:04.821]  It was probably around 1968, 1969, when he was saying those kind of things.
[01:43:04.881 --> 01:43:06.943]  I couldn't place an actual date on it.
[01:43:15.402 --> 01:43:16.242]  Yeah.
[01:43:16.322 --> 01:43:22.785]  So you'd be driving down the road with your dad and you'd hear something about the Kennedys and say, finish the job, or was it in front of the television?
[01:43:22.805 --> 01:43:25.006]  I mean, do you remember one specific case?
[01:43:26.067 --> 01:43:35.851]  No, I don't remember one specific case, but there was a lot of cases where he said disparaging remarks about Bobby Kennedy or John Kennedy, Teddy Kennedy.
[01:43:35.891 --> 01:43:39.373]  You know, he just hated that whole family and everything they stood for.
[01:43:40.954 --> 01:43:41.594]  You know, they were
[01:43:42.592 --> 01:43:48.435]  They were bad people, bad folks to him.
[01:43:48.735 --> 01:43:51.637]  What was your dad's guiding worldview?
[01:43:51.657 --> 01:43:52.597]  What was his politics?
[01:43:52.897 --> 01:43:54.138]  Hardline anti-communism.
[01:43:56.079 --> 01:43:56.819]  Cold warrior.
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:43:59.041]  Super patriot.
[01:43:59.561 --> 01:44:00.982]  The ends justify the means.
[01:44:01.282 --> 01:44:06.424]  If the end is to depose a communist or even a popularly elected
[01:44:08.418 --> 01:44:11.459]  President of a country that was leaning towards communists.
[01:44:11.819 --> 01:44:15.001]  Let's have him removed from office by any means necessary.
[01:44:15.461 --> 01:44:24.144]  Even if it means, you know, the casualties of hundreds, if not thousands, of the civilian population.
[01:44:24.724 --> 01:44:25.544]  Collateral damage?
[01:44:25.825 --> 01:44:26.405]  No problem.
[01:44:27.125 --> 01:44:29.486]  I asked him one time, what about all the people that
[01:44:30.493 --> 01:44:53.651]  that the uh... that the guatemalan coup which you orchestrated uh... uh... you know eventually uh... cause their death and enslavement by the by the secret police and he just said well that's that's just the way it goes you know uh... we we we got our guy in there and that's what's important so he really had little remorse uh... little uh... did he have remorse later in life?
[01:44:55.306 --> 01:45:05.393]  Um, he told me that the only thing in his life that he felt bad about was that the Bay of Pigs and the assassination of Fidel Castro were not successful.
[01:45:06.834 --> 01:45:10.936]  So, no, he went to his grave, he died without feeling any guilt.
[01:45:11.217 --> 01:45:12.477]  I don't, you know, I think so.
[01:45:13.038 --> 01:45:14.839]  Why did he then go public about Kennedy?
[01:45:15.419 --> 01:45:15.940]  Why didn't he?
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:19.402]  No, I mean, why did he go public about Kennedy with that tape then?
[01:45:20.511 --> 01:45:23.452]  Oh, well, because I think it was important to him.
[01:45:23.492 --> 01:45:25.233]  I think it was something he may have been very proud of.
[01:45:26.373 --> 01:45:45.219]  And I think, you know, after having been accused of being a part of that operation in one fashion or another, either being a paymaster or being one of the tramps or being one of the orchestrators, he'd been accused of a lot of things by a lot of people who had made a lot of money using his name in speculative terms.
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:46.660]  I think it was important for him
[01:45:47.633 --> 01:45:57.399]  Not as a matter of so much to clear his conscience, but just as a matter of saying, well, look, you know, I did this, I was involved in this, and I knew about this, and this was a successful operation.
[01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:02.983]  So I think he went to his grave feeling, you know, no remorse about that, certainly.
[01:46:03.143 --> 01:46:05.444]  You think in a way he didn't want to be known for the plumbers?
[01:46:05.484 --> 01:46:06.805]  He wanted to be known for JFK?
[01:46:07.505 --> 01:46:16.451]  Well, certainly he was, you know, he wasn't happy that part of his public legacy was to
[01:46:17.361 --> 01:46:20.322]  You know, go down in the history books as a third-rate burglar for the plumbers.
[01:46:20.422 --> 01:46:24.384]  So this certainly may have been a way of, you know, elevating his status.
[01:46:24.764 --> 01:46:26.485]  Now we begin to get to the meat.
[01:46:26.905 --> 01:46:27.646]  Very interesting.
[01:46:27.666 --> 01:46:29.287]  This is Revening BL in Texas.
[01:46:29.647 --> 01:46:30.327]  Thanks for holding.
[01:46:30.367 --> 01:46:31.928]  You're on the air with St.
[01:46:31.988 --> 01:46:32.528]  John Hunt.
[01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:34.149]  Hi, Alex.
[01:46:34.469 --> 01:46:34.749]  Hi.
[01:46:35.409 --> 01:46:43.793]  Mr. Hunt, I don't think I can properly express my gratitude for learning the truth about the JFK assassination in my lifetime.
[01:46:44.594 --> 01:46:45.494]  Well, sir, thank you.
[01:46:46.929 --> 01:46:58.876]  I wonder if you ever met or associated with any of your dad's personnel around the time of the Kennedy assassination?
[01:47:00.036 --> 01:47:01.737]  At the time of the Kennedy assassination?
[01:47:01.837 --> 01:47:13.024]  No, but following the Kennedy assassination, guys like Frank Sturgis, Bernard Barker, Manuel Artime, Virgilio Gonzalez,
[01:47:14.382 --> 01:47:15.903]  I thought I might have met
[01:47:44.544 --> 01:47:47.206]  I've heard of a story along those lines where there was a
[01:48:13.773 --> 01:48:15.354]  At least one person impersonating him.
[01:48:15.374 --> 01:48:17.096]  He was shooting the other guy's target, yeah.
[01:48:17.496 --> 01:48:17.716]  Yeah.
[01:48:18.076 --> 01:48:19.978]  Well, he was shooting the gentleman that reported that.
[01:48:21.799 --> 01:48:36.850]  Actually, the FBI came to interview me, and it was an elderly agent who was retired, who had been called back, and a young man, and when he heard what I had to say, his face turned ashen gray.
[01:48:37.563 --> 01:48:43.228]  He tore up his notes and he told my father to never let me speak to anyone about that again.
[01:48:43.248 --> 01:48:46.471]  I've heard those words myself.
[01:48:47.512 --> 01:48:51.895]  The man at the rifle range vaguely resembled Oswald, but he was military.
[01:48:51.915 --> 01:48:54.878]  I won't go into all the gory details.
[01:48:54.918 --> 01:48:59.782]  I'm going to write it up as a statement and try to get all the detail in there.
[01:49:01.812 --> 01:49:08.794]  He ranted and raved like a madman, and then whispered under his breath, it's okay kid, I'm not going to hurt you, go on, get out of here.
[01:49:08.814 --> 01:49:09.414]  Yeah.
[01:49:09.854 --> 01:49:27.238]  And he had hand-loaded cartridges for the Mondlicher Carcano carbine that were improperly loaded, obviously intentionally, because they had a slow powder and they would throw out big balls of unburned powder that would explode every time he fired.
[01:49:28.206 --> 01:49:31.169]  And it made a big scene at the Rifle Range.
[01:49:31.210 --> 01:49:32.971]  It attracted a lot of attention.
[01:49:32.991 --> 01:49:35.895]  A lot of people tried to intervene because they thought he was going to hurt me.
[01:49:35.915 --> 01:49:38.097]  By the way, I know BL.
[01:49:38.438 --> 01:49:39.879]  BL, you never told me this story.
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:41.461]  I know you're a credible person.
[01:49:41.501 --> 01:49:42.983]  Write all that up and get it to me immediately.
[01:49:43.383 --> 01:49:46.406]  We'll be right back with more calls straight ahead on the other side for St.
[01:49:46.446 --> 01:49:46.987]  John Hunt.
[01:49:47.327 --> 01:49:47.788]  Stay with us.
[01:49:56.696 --> 01:50:02.140]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:10.145]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.874 --> 01:50:17.939]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.319 --> 01:50:29.746]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.066 --> 01:50:33.529]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.029 --> 01:50:35.930]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.290 --> 01:50:40.133]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.650 --> 01:50:56.832]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:50:56.852 --> 01:51:00.894]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:51:01.034 --> 01:51:03.596]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:51:03.656 --> 01:51:05.977]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:51:06.177 --> 01:51:14.602]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:51:14.682 --> 01:51:15.983]  The brookie light is different.
[01:51:16.123 --> 01:51:20.145]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:51:20.185 --> 01:51:20.645]  We're good to go!

[01:51:53.385 --> 01:51:55.087]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:55.327 --> 01:51:59.030]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:59.350 --> 01:52:01.552]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:52:02.072 --> 01:52:08.278]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:08.438 --> 01:52:13.342]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.522 --> 01:52:22.547]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[01:52:55.742 --> 01:53:05.964]  St.
[01:53:06.084 --> 01:53:17.067]  John Hunt, son of E. Howard Hunt, black ops legend, joins us.
[01:53:17.907 --> 01:53:21.168]  Blowing the Kennedy conspiracy theory of the government wide open.
[01:53:22.754 --> 01:53:24.136]  Let's go to Richard in Texas.
[01:53:24.216 --> 01:53:26.539]  Richard, you're on the air with St.
[01:53:26.579 --> 01:53:27.020]  John Hunt.
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:27.440]  Go ahead.
[01:53:27.961 --> 01:53:28.902]  Hello, guys, and St.
[01:53:28.942 --> 01:53:31.826]  John, thank you very much for your bravery in coming out with all of this.
[01:53:31.906 --> 01:53:35.852]  It's very, very important, I think, as to what's going on today.
[01:53:36.885 --> 01:53:38.125]  I'm curious about two things.
[01:53:38.346 --> 01:53:52.609]  One, if there was ever any detail mentioned by your father with regard to the assassination of RFK, and the player is truly involved in that, and also it seems to be that he's not mentioned Bush Sr.
[01:53:53.070 --> 01:53:56.230]  as far as any role in the JFK assassination.
[01:53:56.551 --> 01:54:01.692]  There is a picture of him outside the Texas Depository that appears to be him, and also his
[01:54:02.456 --> 01:54:04.477]  Well, I can't offer any speculation about that.
[01:54:04.497 --> 01:54:06.758]  My father never mentioned anything about George Bush.
[01:54:06.978 --> 01:54:08.738]  And what was your other question?
[01:54:28.916 --> 01:54:36.360]  With regard to the assassination of Bobby Kennedy, and what role and who the players were with that assassination?
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:42.664]  No, he never discussed the RFK assassination other than he was, you know, glad that it happened.
[01:54:44.244 --> 01:54:46.005]  I think that's a huge new development.
[01:54:46.045 --> 01:54:50.388]  You're saying your dad, I mean, how does he express his enjoyment of him being dead?
[01:54:51.569 --> 01:54:55.451]  Well, he just, he felt no sadness.
[01:54:55.731 --> 01:54:57.752]  You know, the rest of the nation was in a
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:04.903]  In a deep state of horror and tragedy and shock and disbelief and sadness.
[01:55:05.363 --> 01:55:06.984]  My father was just very cool about it.
[01:55:07.324 --> 01:55:11.126]  He was very composed.
[01:55:12.966 --> 01:55:21.290]  I wouldn't say he was jumping around tooting a horn, but he was certainly not disturbed by it.
[01:55:21.838 --> 01:55:26.060]  Well, I mean, but earlier, to be specific, you said that he was glad.
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:32.403]  I mean, were you watching TV, or did he say, you know, or, hey, that's good, or, oh, well, who cares?
[01:55:34.024 --> 01:55:50.773]  Well, he was glad in the sense that when the news came down, you know, or came over the television, he was just pleased, you know, glad in the sense that he didn't say, well, that's
[01:55:51.454 --> 01:55:51.574]  Yes.
[01:56:07.225 --> 01:56:12.528]  I can't recall anything specifically that he said, but... You just know that it was a good day.
[01:56:13.248 --> 01:56:14.409]  It was a good day for him.
[01:56:14.429 --> 01:56:23.314]  We grew up hating Kennedy, and so if this was one less Kennedy that the world, that the country was going to have to deal with, it was a good thing.
[01:56:23.494 --> 01:56:25.235]  So that was very clear.
[01:56:26.996 --> 01:56:27.656]  Unbelievable.
[01:56:27.716 --> 01:56:29.638]  That is a great question you brought up, Richard.
[01:56:29.678 --> 01:56:30.158]  Anything else?
[01:56:31.101 --> 01:56:38.946]  Yeah, just curious if he might have ever mentioned anything with regard to Manchurian candidates and the use of these type folks to commit these crimes.
[01:56:38.966 --> 01:56:40.207]  Well, it's not even Manchurian.
[01:56:40.227 --> 01:56:51.754]  They had Sirhan Sirhan just stumbling around on an amnesiac and the official LA coroner said that Kennedy had been blasted a bunch in the back, Sirhan's at the front, and it was blowing holes in his jacket.
[01:56:51.774 --> 01:56:53.215]  You've got to be a foot away to do that.
[01:56:53.536 --> 01:56:57.118]  They just shot him right in the back and then grabbed a mental patient and trotted him out.
[01:56:57.739 --> 01:56:58.059]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:56:58.419 --> 01:56:58.539]  Yeah.
[01:57:12.168 --> 01:57:12.348]  St.
[01:57:12.368 --> 01:57:13.409]  John, we'll get your comments on that.
[01:57:13.429 --> 01:57:14.790]  It sounds like you have something to say about that.
[01:57:15.190 --> 01:57:15.991]  Richard, stay there.
[01:57:16.011 --> 01:57:25.157]  We've got 20 minutes left or so with just an amazing individual who I'm so honored has decided to spend this much time with us, and we'll have him back up again.
[01:57:25.637 --> 01:57:26.138]  And he's St.
[01:57:26.178 --> 01:57:26.638]  John Hunt.
[01:57:26.658 --> 01:57:28.099]  We appreciate his courage going public.
[01:57:28.399 --> 01:57:30.841]  The website's stjohnhunt.com.
[01:57:33.503 --> 01:57:38.166]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.731 --> 01:57:50.371]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.031 --> 01:57:52.091]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.791 --> 01:57:53.912]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.552 --> 01:57:55.392]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.132 --> 01:57:57.033]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.693 --> 01:58:01.514]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.874 --> 01:58:05.955]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:13.237 --> 01:58:18.481]  We've got him here just for you to take your phone calls, though some other huge revelations have just come out.
[01:58:20.022 --> 01:58:22.664]  In the last hour, we'll recap before he leaves us with St.
[01:58:22.704 --> 01:58:23.204]  John Hunt.
[01:58:23.564 --> 01:58:34.952]  He's got a hour-plus video presentation he did that's excellent, that is incredibly historical, that you need to get, and it's available at stjohnhunt.com right now.
[01:58:35.012 --> 01:58:35.412]  He's St.
[01:58:35.453 --> 01:58:35.933]  John Hunt.
[01:58:36.473 --> 01:58:41.717]  Again, his father is what the character in Mission Impossible TV show and movies based on, Ethan Hunt.
[01:58:42.325 --> 01:58:52.172]  E. Howard Hunt, who overthrew elected presidents, who ran Black Ops, Bay of Pigs, and now admits in a deathbed tape that he was involved in the JFK assassination.
[01:58:52.852 --> 01:58:56.475]  And again, didn't people in our own movement try to spin it and claim he said he wasn't?
[01:58:57.695 --> 01:59:07.402]  Just because I don't know, they're so afraid of big news coming out, or I guess they just want to keep saying it's a conspiracy theory, and they're the experts and they've got all the answers?
[01:59:08.455 --> 01:59:17.263]  Pretty amazing, when clearly, and his son agrees, he's saying, no, I was involved, but in a management position, not as a, you know, in the rodeo, but as a rodeo announcer.
[01:59:18.003 --> 01:59:23.228]  And then people say, well, you're saying it, the bop stops at LBJ, clearly Nixon was involved.
[01:59:23.908 --> 01:59:27.031]  We're just going off the CIA under the President.
[01:59:27.611 --> 01:59:29.533]  Of course we know there were people above it.
[01:59:29.853 --> 01:59:35.878]  We've had the experts, and the witnesses, and the lawyers, and the mistress, and all on about that.
[01:59:36.477 --> 01:59:38.198]  And we know the British Intel is involved.
[01:59:38.218 --> 01:59:39.658]  We know they were all brought to the table.
[01:59:40.879 --> 01:59:47.182]  But again, that's just the classic type of criticism that this show gets when all we try to do is do our job.
[01:59:47.602 --> 01:59:49.903]  And again, I commend St.
[01:59:49.943 --> 01:59:50.403]  John Hunt.
[01:59:50.423 --> 01:59:56.726]  I've heard some criticism of him, going, oh, he puts out this thing with his dad saying he wasn't involved but knew about it.
[01:59:57.446 --> 02:00:03.349]  No, he says I was involved and brought in because I was trusted and known to be honest in the organization.
[02:00:03.809 --> 02:00:05.070]  And I was a benchwarmer.
[02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:06.851]  He was there managing things.
[02:00:06.871 --> 02:00:07.611]  That's what that means.
[02:00:07.891 --> 02:00:12.154]  You're in the game, you're at the stadium, you're just not there pulling the trigger.
[02:00:12.734 --> 02:00:21.499]  They call it bench warming, or they call it in the bleachers, I've also seen it in some publications and documents, when you're not pulling the trigger.
[02:00:21.779 --> 02:00:23.380]  When you're on the ground managing things.
[02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:24.440]  St.
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:26.181]  John Hunt, any comment on that?
[02:00:26.782 --> 02:00:31.064]  No, I don't have much of a comment on that, but I certainly agree with you.
[02:00:31.264 --> 02:00:34.566]  And of course my father also told me, and this is in
[02:00:35.495 --> 02:01:01.929]  There's an additional portion of audio tape which I haven't made public yet, but he goes into saying that there was more information that he had that he wanted to give me, but he was going to do that at a later date, and of course that later date never came, so this could have been much, this would have gone deeper and been farther reaching, but I'm very fortunate and feel my father was
[02:01:02.910 --> 02:01:04.131]  I was on the right track here.
[02:01:05.152 --> 02:01:06.733]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:01:07.054 --> 02:01:08.355]  No, that's it.
[02:01:08.435 --> 02:01:17.703]  And he told you that the operation's name, not just code he was using with you, but the operation's name for killing the president or the name of that was the big event?
[02:01:18.063 --> 02:01:18.664]  Yes, indeed.
[02:01:18.764 --> 02:01:19.024]  Uh-huh.
[02:01:19.044 --> 02:01:19.644]  The big event.
[02:01:20.825 --> 02:01:24.008]  Well, we've got Kennedy revelations with Bobby here.
[02:01:24.549 --> 02:01:27.531]  We've got your father saying we need to finish the job with Ted Kennedy.
[02:01:28.412 --> 02:01:28.912]  We've got
[02:01:30.586 --> 02:01:32.868]  You know, the number two guy from Cuba.
[02:01:32.888 --> 02:01:34.509]  I had dinner with you guys.
[02:01:34.549 --> 02:01:35.629]  What an amazing interview.
[02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:36.530]  I just want to thank you.
[02:01:36.750 --> 02:01:41.293]  I know I keep saying this for your courage, because obviously you're not stupid, and the evidence is clear.
[02:01:41.313 --> 02:01:43.695]  They blew your mother up in that plane landing in Chicago.
[02:01:44.235 --> 02:01:54.402]  I mean, you know what you're doing is dangerous, but what was really dangerous was you having that tape and having this info in the intermediate time and getting ready to talk about it.
[02:01:54.947 --> 02:02:04.777]  Yeah, since January of 2004, actually since the summer of 2003, I carried this information around with me, kept moving it from one location to another.
[02:02:08.908 --> 02:02:28.313]  You know, kind of had a nagging worry, you know, gnawing away inside me that this was a huge amount of weight to be carrying around while I'm trying to lead a fairly normal life as a student and as a musician and as a caregiver, you know, to have this kind of responsibility on my shoulders.
[02:02:29.433 --> 02:02:33.494]  It's been great that you guys have been helping me get this information out because although
[02:02:34.535 --> 02:02:42.438]  It's, you know, there's a... It's just another, you know, ripple in the pond, but, you know... Absolutely, we've got a break.
[02:02:42.478 --> 02:02:43.378]  Stay there, we've got a break.
[02:02:44.299 --> 02:02:51.881]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.201 --> 02:02:54.122]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.502 --> 02:03:02.125]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.836 --> 02:03:09.881]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.301 --> 02:03:21.728]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.028 --> 02:03:25.591]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.991 --> 02:03:27.892]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.252 --> 02:03:32.035]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.749 --> 02:03:50.974]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:03:51.114 --> 02:03:59.221]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:03:59.461 --> 02:04:06.527]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:04:06.687 --> 02:04:07.968]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:04:08.048 --> 02:04:13.952]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:04:14.132 --> 02:04:19.236]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:04:19.356 --> 02:04:28.222]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:04:28.482 --> 02:04:31.785]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:04:33.946 --> 02:04:35.787]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer!
[02:04:35.968 --> 02:04:39.170]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[02:04:53.251 --> 02:04:54.371]  For a while, anyway.
[02:04:54.892 --> 02:04:58.053]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[02:04:58.673 --> 02:05:01.014]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[02:05:01.314 --> 02:05:04.816]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[02:05:05.156 --> 02:05:07.437]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[02:05:07.977 --> 02:05:08.677]  What's the name again?
[02:05:08.697 --> 02:05:10.078]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[02:05:10.458 --> 02:05:11.278]  It's CalX.
[02:05:11.618 --> 02:05:11.858]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[02:05:14.145 --> 02:05:15.806]  What makes Calex Ointment so different?
[02:05:16.026 --> 02:05:24.349]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[02:05:25.370 --> 02:05:29.932]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Calex Ointment.
[02:05:30.152 --> 02:05:39.255]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B Grocery Stores, Medicine Shop Pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[02:05:39.956 --> 02:05:41.076]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[02:05:41.136 --> 02:05:41.796]  I'll be right back.
[02:05:42.057 --> 02:05:42.977]  I'm getting some Calex.
[02:05:46.696 --> 02:05:52.717]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.317 --> 02:05:56.358]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.778 --> 02:06:05.500]  Our listeners, very well read and informed, are bringing us a lot of good questions and taking us to a lot of places that I wouldn't have thought to go.
[02:06:07.220 --> 02:06:08.380]  Our guest, again, is St.
[02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:09.061]  John Hunt.
[02:06:10.281 --> 02:06:15.562]  He is the son, the eldest son, of Spymaster E. Howard Hunt.
[02:06:16.309 --> 02:06:19.152]  Blowing the JFK assassination to kingdom come.
[02:06:19.712 --> 02:06:22.074]  Already over 90% of the public in major polls.
[02:06:22.114 --> 02:06:23.015]  The media keeps going over 80%.
[02:06:23.535 --> 02:06:24.516]  That's like five years ago.
[02:06:24.837 --> 02:06:27.959]  It's over 90% in new polls in the last few years.
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:29.361]  I know it's an inside job.
[02:06:29.401 --> 02:06:31.202]  And now there's... it's fair to complete.
[02:06:32.163 --> 02:06:37.388]  Everybody knows the truth unless they're the few talking heads on TV still saying it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:06:37.848 --> 02:06:38.048]  St.
[02:06:38.088 --> 02:06:39.870]  John, I heard you did Glenn Beck.
[02:06:40.250 --> 02:06:41.411]  I didn't see it or hear it.
[02:06:41.471 --> 02:06:42.192]  How did he treat you?
[02:06:43.794 --> 02:06:57.170]  I had somewhat of an apprehension about Glenn Beck because he's kind of a wild card on that show, but he was very, very respectful, very knowledgeable, and treated me with great respect, and I couldn't have had a better show with him.
[02:06:57.230 --> 02:06:59.453]  It was a brief 15-minute appearance on his radio.
[02:07:00.683 --> 02:07:09.289]  Well, he's a little more sophisticated than mainline neocons like Limbaugh or other people like that.
[02:07:09.329 --> 02:07:16.314]  He mixes in a little of the conspiracy stuff because he knows that's where the whole audience is.
[02:07:16.354 --> 02:07:17.394]  That's the thing about Glenn Beck, though.
[02:07:17.434 --> 02:07:18.815]  I know he knows about all this stuff.
[02:07:19.075 --> 02:07:24.399]  He's a smart guy, but he makes the decision to water everything down, so I'm glad he treated you well.
[02:07:25.167 --> 02:07:29.091]  I mean, he knows where 90% of people are, so that's why.
[02:07:29.111 --> 02:07:38.721]  I just did a segment for Inside Edition, which is going to be aired next week, I think, about this stuff.
[02:07:38.841 --> 02:07:45.287]  So finally we're forcing it out, because we've been reporting this for a couple of weeks, really a few months now, since the Rolling Stone.
[02:07:45.988 --> 02:07:48.490]  In fact, that was my last question that I had in my list, I didn't get to St.
[02:07:48.530 --> 02:07:48.630]  John.
[02:07:49.945 --> 02:07:53.886]  You had 60 Minutes come to you, others, but then they were afraid, or what happened?
[02:07:54.466 --> 02:07:58.547]  Well, I don't know what they told me as far as 60 Minutes goes.
[02:07:58.587 --> 02:08:00.488]  Yeah, they came out to talk to me.
[02:08:00.528 --> 02:08:08.549]  They flew me down to San Francisco, put me up at a nice hotel, and then they said they were very enthusiastic about the project.
[02:08:08.589 --> 02:08:13.571]  They wanted to fly me out to New York to do a taping, and then all of a sudden, the word came down.
[02:08:15.353 --> 02:08:19.515]  That, oh well, we're not going to go with it.
[02:08:19.535 --> 02:08:20.455]  This isn't very important.
[02:08:20.475 --> 02:08:23.237]  We're going to have Andy Rooney talk about cake baking.
[02:08:24.617 --> 02:08:25.538]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:08:25.558 --> 02:08:38.603]  And the LA Times came up and did a six hour interview with me in Eureka and then I was still down after a month of waiting for that article to come out to a kind of a
[02:08:40.004 --> 02:08:40.405]  That's right.
[02:08:54.821 --> 02:08:56.142]  I mean, let me be clear about this.
[02:08:56.182 --> 02:08:57.563]  I mean, I've read about you.
[02:08:57.583 --> 02:08:58.123]  I've assessed you.
[02:08:58.164 --> 02:08:58.864]  You're a good guy.
[02:08:58.884 --> 02:09:02.967]  I mean, who cares if when you were a teenager they found some weed or something?
[02:09:03.187 --> 02:09:03.968]  I mean, I love this.
[02:09:03.988 --> 02:09:07.911]  You know, Bush is running around drunkenly on cocaine, but he can be our president.
[02:09:07.951 --> 02:09:12.855]  But they always want to say, this person had a crooked toenail once, so we can't listen to him.
[02:09:13.155 --> 02:09:18.119]  But is it just that I trust you and I believe you and you're giving us, you know, your view from your perspective on this?
[02:09:18.399 --> 02:09:19.620]  I've interviewed all the experts.
[02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:24.063]  I've done, you know, many shows on this, hundreds, TV shows.
[02:09:24.924 --> 02:09:25.924]  I'm from Texas.
[02:09:26.365 --> 02:09:29.567]  I've interviewed all these people who were eyewitnesses and everything.
[02:09:29.847 --> 02:09:32.309]  So everything you're saying already checks out to what I knew.
[02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:34.631]  And so it's just, you're just confirming.
[02:09:34.831 --> 02:09:36.552]  You have total credibility in my book.
[02:09:36.913 --> 02:09:37.853]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:09:38.073 --> 02:09:38.414]  Thank you.
[02:09:39.194 --> 02:09:39.555]  Thank you.
[02:09:40.395 --> 02:09:42.857]  I think if, you know, credibility was based on
[02:09:44.919 --> 02:09:50.782]  You know, never having lived or made a mistake in your life, I don't think there would be anybody that could qualify as credible then.
[02:09:51.423 --> 02:09:52.043]  Exactly.
[02:09:52.303 --> 02:09:52.824]  Exactly.
[02:09:52.884 --> 02:09:53.564]  Let's go ahead.
[02:09:53.584 --> 02:10:01.428]  And of course, it's always that guy who has no record, never been in trouble, never been wild, wears the perfect suit, and you find out there's 50 bodies in his basement.
[02:10:01.869 --> 02:10:02.269]  Exactly.
[02:10:02.729 --> 02:10:04.050]  Let's talk to David in California.
[02:10:04.070 --> 02:10:04.730]  David, you're on the air.
[02:10:04.750 --> 02:10:06.611]  Hi, St.
[02:10:06.651 --> 02:10:06.952]  John.
[02:10:06.972 --> 02:10:07.972]  Hi, Alex.
[02:10:08.472 --> 02:10:09.473]  Glad to be here at the show.
[02:10:10.154 --> 02:10:16.897]  Hey, I was, uh, the last call I kind of asked you about, uh, Bush, um, the name ever coming up in your house.
[02:10:17.057 --> 02:10:19.078]  I know you said that you'd never met the person.
[02:10:19.538 --> 02:10:20.538]  I'm just kind of curious.
[02:10:20.578 --> 02:10:26.881]  I mean, um, Zapata Oil was, was Bush's famous, uh, Bay of Pigs fiasco.
[02:10:27.501 --> 02:10:32.463]  And I'm just kind of curious, you never heard the name Bush or Zapata in the household at all?
[02:10:32.483 --> 02:10:36.965]  Do you think that your dad, too, to Bush at all?
[02:10:37.509 --> 02:10:37.729]  No.
[02:10:38.110 --> 02:10:39.150]  No, I never did.
[02:10:39.671 --> 02:10:39.871]  No.
[02:10:40.631 --> 02:10:41.972]  And by the way, I believe St.
[02:10:42.032 --> 02:10:49.098]  John, I mean, he may have told his son when he was 16, I'm CIA, and had him clean up some equipment once and make a few jokes about the Kennedys.
[02:10:49.338 --> 02:10:55.682]  You don't just walk around going, Operation Ziku 9, Zapata Operation Oil Rigs, George W. Bush, you know.
[02:10:56.443 --> 02:10:57.584]  No, I understand that.
[02:10:57.604 --> 02:11:01.206]  I was just kind of curious if maybe you overheard it ever.
[02:11:01.306 --> 02:11:04.269]  I mean, there's a great film online about the Bush
[02:11:05.305 --> 02:11:10.947]  uh... oil connection or Kevin Zapata oil and how he's tied to the JFK.
[02:11:10.987 --> 02:11:11.867]  Yes, JFK too.
[02:11:11.967 --> 02:11:15.429]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.tv and I appreciate your call.
[02:11:16.089 --> 02:11:20.271]  Clearly, I can say that we know George Bush Senior didn't just become the director in 76.
[02:11:20.911 --> 02:11:22.611]  We know he was in the CIA at the time.
[02:11:22.651 --> 02:11:26.113]  He was out of Skull and Bones, where most of the leadership came from out of Yale.
[02:11:27.073 --> 02:11:29.034]  The photo is him, you can tell.
[02:11:29.054 --> 02:11:31.935]  I mean it's even clearer than Sturgis and Hunt in the photos.
[02:11:32.655 --> 02:11:37.596]  And, you know, clearly he's a black operator, and that's just the way it is.
[02:11:39.376 --> 02:11:44.077]  But I totally believe that E. Howard Hunt wasn't walking around talking about George Bush all day.
[02:11:44.637 --> 02:11:45.257]  Right, right.
[02:11:45.657 --> 02:11:50.058]  You know, our house was like a miniature CIA organization.
[02:11:50.098 --> 02:12:01.720]  There was very little, you know, talked about, and certainly no sharing of information with regards to any kind of, you know, political operations going on.
[02:12:02.561 --> 02:12:04.663]  Michael in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:12:05.344 --> 02:12:05.945]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[02:12:07.046 --> 02:12:17.856]  In your description of cleaning up the suitcase and what have you, and what you say is true, you very well could be an accessory to one of the most famous murders of our time.
[02:12:18.537 --> 02:12:20.940]  No, no, no, the suitcase is the plumbers.
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:23.222]  Right, the suitcase is Watergate related.
[02:12:24.682 --> 02:12:44.273]  The suitcases, the plumbers, when the people, some of them had been caught and he was having his son, because his son's fingerprints weren't on record, as Hunt's of course would be with the federal government probably, he was having his son clean up the briefcase from some of the gear used in the surveillance operations on psychiatrists to find out dirt on Democrats.
[02:12:45.153 --> 02:12:46.414]  Yeah, my apologies.
[02:12:46.474 --> 02:12:47.474]  Thanks for clarifying that.
[02:12:47.514 --> 02:12:48.635]  I came in at the tail end.
[02:12:49.075 --> 02:12:52.257]  I was just curious how this jibe with Galen Ross' book
[02:12:54.324 --> 02:12:55.525]  All right, dovetails exactly.
[02:12:55.706 --> 02:12:56.566]  I appreciate your call.
[02:12:56.606 --> 02:13:00.430]  He names it Howard Hunt, and basically anybody who's a real researcher does.
[02:13:01.572 --> 02:13:03.033]  Let's go ahead and talk to Josh.
[02:13:03.574 --> 02:13:04.675]  No, it's John in Ohio.
[02:13:04.715 --> 02:13:05.416]  John, go ahead.
[02:13:06.196 --> 02:13:17.228]  Yes, there's another story that's out right now about Luis Posada, the notorious terrorist who has blown up a Cuban airliner, bombed Cuban hotels.
[02:13:18.001 --> 02:13:22.722]  Plotted to blow up Panama University, was convicted for that, bragged about bombing Cuban hotels.
[02:13:23.222 --> 02:13:30.384]  Yet, just last Tuesday, he was freed, given total freedom, even from the technical violation, immigration violation.
[02:13:30.444 --> 02:13:38.266]  Now he's joined his co-conspirator in blowing up this Cuban airliner at the B.S., the CIA, Orlando Bosh in Florida.
[02:13:38.666 --> 02:13:47.148]  I was reading a workers' org, someone, I think Dirty Griswold, who was in the National Committee to Investigate the JFK Assassination, and
[02:13:48.361 --> 02:13:54.964]  She points out a lot of people believe that he was involved, one of the trigger men, in Dallas at the time.
[02:13:54.984 --> 02:13:55.884]  Let's ask the question.
[02:13:55.984 --> 02:13:57.785]  He admitted he's a CIA terrorist.
[02:13:57.805 --> 02:13:59.005]  That's a BBC headline.
[02:13:59.466 --> 02:14:05.468]  Our government blowing up passenger planes full of Olympic athletes just because they were mad that the Cubans had won some gold medals.
[02:14:05.488 --> 02:14:06.989]  I mean, that's the level of this.
[02:14:07.009 --> 02:14:09.330]  You know, doing that.
[02:14:10.630 --> 02:14:14.512]  Luis Posada Correlius, in my film Terror Storm, did you ever meet him?
[02:14:14.532 --> 02:14:15.232]  Did you ever see him?
[02:14:15.272 --> 02:14:15.852]  Ever hear about him?
[02:14:16.693 --> 02:14:17.633]  No, no sir, I did not.
[02:14:18.669 --> 02:14:26.953]  What I wanted to mention is that he was part of this Operation 40 that many believe was the trigger man involved in the Kennedy assassination.
[02:14:27.013 --> 02:14:28.374]  Porter Goss was part of that.
[02:14:28.414 --> 02:14:31.615]  He's now head of the CIA, appointed by Bush as head of the CIA.
[02:14:32.676 --> 02:14:36.257]  Luis Posada and Felix Rodriguez.
[02:14:36.297 --> 02:14:43.721]  These people were involved with George Bush in the Iran-Contra funding of the death squad regimes in Central America and the Contra terrorists at the time.
[02:14:44.101 --> 02:14:45.602]  They have intimate connections.
[02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:53.675]  And I think we may have right in our hands now a man who was one of the trigger men, as well as a terrorist, who was blackmailing Bush.
[02:14:54.375 --> 02:14:57.497]  He was in prison in Texas, and then they ordered him released.
[02:14:57.517 --> 02:14:59.919]  They just said, we're releasing you, King Zachs.
[02:14:59.939 --> 02:15:00.419]  He's gone.
[02:15:01.099 --> 02:15:06.243]  Yeah, I mean, it's incredible that this could happen, and it shows the control of the media.
[02:15:06.283 --> 02:15:10.165]  Something as huge as that should be on front page headlines for weeks.
[02:15:10.583 --> 02:15:12.503]  Has been completely shoved aside.
[02:15:12.583 --> 02:15:15.744]  They could be giving that long history of him blowing up.
[02:15:15.824 --> 02:15:16.584]  Sure, I understand.
[02:15:17.805 --> 02:15:18.705]  We made a film about it.
[02:15:18.885 --> 02:15:19.625]  We exposed it.
[02:15:20.585 --> 02:15:21.426]  I talked about it last week.
[02:15:21.446 --> 02:15:22.526]  It's a travesty of justice.
[02:15:22.966 --> 02:15:24.906]  But do you have any comments about JFK's assassination?
[02:15:25.687 --> 02:15:26.107]  Well, yeah.
[02:15:26.207 --> 02:15:32.988]  I'm just saying that this man, many believe, was involved in the Kennedy assassination in Dallas at the time.
[02:15:33.008 --> 02:15:33.248]  Okay.
[02:15:33.468 --> 02:15:34.509]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:15:34.889 --> 02:15:35.989]  Mike in Wyoming.
[02:15:36.009 --> 02:15:36.629]  You're on the air.
[02:15:36.669 --> 02:15:37.069]  Go ahead.
[02:15:38.430 --> 02:15:39.190]  Yes, hi, Mr. Hunt.
[02:15:40.697 --> 02:15:41.817]  Two quick questions.
[02:15:44.178 --> 02:15:48.659]  You mentioned that your dad had a deep hatred of communism.
[02:15:48.879 --> 02:15:55.100]  Did he understand that communism was basically a boogeyman created by the big internationalist bankers?
[02:15:56.780 --> 02:15:58.061]  He never expressed that to me, no.
[02:15:58.081 --> 02:15:59.841]  Okay, the other question.
[02:16:00.301 --> 02:16:04.982]  There was a book that came out a couple years ago called Regicide.
[02:16:05.649 --> 02:16:32.910]  And I dismissed it at the time in favor of Michael Piper's book, Final Judgment, about the JFK assassination, but Regicide purported to be a book based on the notes of a dead CIA operative, and he claimed that there was a lot of resentment towards Kennedy, both Kennedy's, John and Robert, because of their coziness with the Communists, particularly Khrushchev.
[02:16:34.128 --> 02:17:00.300]  uh... it was claimed that uh... some of the uh... uh... passed on some secretive uh... type information to to kind of check this this out and uh... they were finding out that uh... all the things that the confidential and top secret stuff that they would pass on to to both the kennedys would somehow managed to make its way to the uh... uh... to cruise ship and so uh... you know it was a lot of support to the
[02:17:01.065 --> 02:17:10.114]  Well, that's also how the globalists would manipulate their attack dogs, is they would leak it.
[02:17:10.194 --> 02:17:16.419]  I mean, it's well known that our government gave the A-bomb to the Soviets and then fried the Rosenbergs.
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:18.061]  I mean, it's constant.
[02:17:18.942 --> 02:17:23.606]  I mean, now they have a CIA section chief on History Channel admitting our government put mail in.
[02:17:23.726 --> 02:17:24.487]  I already knew that.
[02:17:25.197 --> 02:17:27.920]  But to see him admit it was just... Tell you what, St.
[02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:29.501]  John Hunt, one more segment with our guest.
[02:17:29.961 --> 02:17:31.603]  Let you finish up, Mike, on Wyoming.
[02:17:31.643 --> 02:17:33.044]  On the other side, maybe one or two other calls.
[02:17:34.145 --> 02:17:37.068]  Then we got Dr. John Breen in studio with some other big developments.
[02:17:38.009 --> 02:17:38.849]  Ah, it's too much to cover.
[02:17:38.869 --> 02:17:39.490]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:47.631 --> 02:17:51.753]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:17:51.973 --> 02:17:53.734]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:17:53.994 --> 02:18:00.296]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:18:00.577 --> 02:18:06.699]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:18:06.939 --> 02:18:08.780]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:18:09.060 --> 02:18:09.361]  I think?
[02:18:25.498 --> 02:18:27.359]  Using pictures are easy to follow.
[02:18:27.539 --> 02:18:30.099]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:18:30.199 --> 02:18:32.580]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[02:18:35.801 --> 02:18:37.721]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:18:52.415 --> 02:18:57.218]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:57.439 --> 02:19:00.201]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:19:00.221 --> 02:19:01.361]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:19:02.682 --> 02:19:07.285]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:08.206 --> 02:19:15.471]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:19:16.472 --> 02:19:19.514]  Midas Resources is offering the red buck and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[02:19:21.664 --> 02:19:25.127]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:19:26.108 --> 02:19:27.389]  Call for your copy today.
[02:19:27.629 --> 02:19:29.831]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.892 --> 02:19:36.737]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:19:37.438 --> 02:19:37.738]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:37.758 --> 02:19:38.059]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.726 --> 02:19:48.608]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:19:48.948 --> 02:19:51.830]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:19:52.050 --> 02:19:58.254]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:20:45.320 --> 02:20:46.161]  Attention gardeners!
[02:20:46.221 --> 02:20:48.583]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[02:20:48.823 --> 02:20:53.167]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[02:20:53.367 --> 02:21:01.234]  It's called Proto Grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[02:21:01.554 --> 02:21:04.375]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[02:21:04.655 --> 02:21:12.198]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[02:21:12.298 --> 02:21:17.900]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[02:21:18.120 --> 02:21:23.682]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[02:21:23.942 --> 02:21:27.263]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[02:21:27.503 --> 02:21:30.844]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[02:21:31.084 --> 02:21:36.129]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[02:21:36.149 --> 02:21:39.013]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:21:39.073 --> 02:21:39.253]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:21:55.743 --> 02:21:55.823]  St.
[02:21:55.903 --> 02:21:56.904]  John Hunt is our guest.
[02:21:56.924 --> 02:21:58.164]  Again, I appreciate him joining us.
[02:21:58.185 --> 02:21:59.245]  I appreciate his courage.
[02:21:59.265 --> 02:22:00.606]  Stjohnhunt.com is the website.
[02:22:00.666 --> 02:22:04.508]  If you missed it, links are up on Infowars.com in the guest section right now.
[02:22:04.548 --> 02:22:07.610]  Mike in Wyoming, finishing up your comment about
[02:22:24.697 --> 02:22:27.078]  Leaking and activities with the Communists.
[02:22:27.218 --> 02:22:37.844]  I know from what's even been in books I've read, what's been on Frontline, and some documentaries I've seen, that the Kennedys did not want nuclear war, and the Cuban Missile Crisis freaked them out.
[02:22:38.384 --> 02:22:39.845]  They knew that war was about to happen.
[02:22:39.865 --> 02:22:42.566]  The Joint Chiefs, it's admitted, came in and said, let's start nuclear war.
[02:22:42.586 --> 02:22:48.789]  It was like Dr. Strangelove and the President's like, I will not go down in history as the greatest mass murderer since Adolf Hitler.
[02:22:49.130 --> 02:22:51.791]  That is reportedly basically a paraphrase of what Kennedy said.
[02:22:52.572 --> 02:22:59.785]  And so he basically, it's admitted, gave them memos saying, look, there's going to be a coup, they're going to kill me, and they're going to nuke you.
[02:22:59.845 --> 02:23:01.427]  Do not play games with these people.
[02:23:01.908 --> 02:23:03.090]  In fact, I saw that on Frontline.
[02:23:03.130 --> 02:23:04.052]  I also read about it.
[02:23:04.845 --> 02:23:07.267]  And the Soviets actually backed off at that point.
[02:23:07.607 --> 02:23:20.815]  Now, what the Kennedy's didn't know is the whole time, the higher level, kind of the Bilderberg-level type group, had their agents everywhere, and they were feeding technologies back, because the military-industrial complex here actually wanted to build up the Communists.
[02:23:21.135 --> 02:23:23.877]  It came out in 1991 that Bush Sr.
[02:23:23.897 --> 02:23:31.001]  actually tried to keep Mikhail Gorbachev in power instead of Boris Yeltsin, to keep that whole thing going.
[02:23:31.681 --> 02:23:33.763]  But to any other comments, Mike, or any comments, St.
[02:23:33.783 --> 02:23:34.103]  John's?
[02:23:36.142 --> 02:23:37.623]  No, I don't have a comment on that.
[02:23:37.644 --> 02:23:54.899]  I think that's all really fascinating, and there's just such a tremendous amount of material out there that it's kind of hard to get a handle on everything, but I know that my family, my father was an anti-communist, meaning that any
[02:23:57.950 --> 02:23:58.291]  Yeah.
[02:24:08.519 --> 02:24:15.325]  The interest of the United States and that government was trying to be eliminated at any means necessary.
[02:24:15.385 --> 02:24:18.188]  And of course, that's always a perfect emotional salve.
[02:24:18.548 --> 02:24:22.091]  Oh, we've got to do all these evil things because it's for the greater good.
[02:24:22.392 --> 02:24:33.662]  The Machiavellian view of the end justifies the means, which they now teach everybody in special ops and above that into the black ops that are run by the shadow government.
[02:24:33.702 --> 02:24:34.683]  It's the perfect excuse.
[02:24:35.737 --> 02:24:45.122]  They also compartmentalize that, whereas the CIA section chief in China, before he died, could go on History Channel and say, yeah, we actually put Mao in.
[02:24:45.142 --> 02:24:50.425]  Boy, I bet that would freak people out like your dad if he was to see that, because I know that aired before he died.
[02:24:50.786 --> 02:24:51.046]  Yeah.
[02:24:51.306 --> 02:24:52.767]  Did your dad ever hear about anything like that?
[02:24:53.207 --> 02:24:54.988]  No, no, I don't know that he did or not.
[02:24:55.648 --> 02:24:57.950]  Yeah, it's probably unfair for me to ask.
[02:24:59.485 --> 02:24:59.685]  St.
[02:24:59.705 --> 02:25:04.848]  John to shed any more light on the Kennedy administration.
[02:25:04.908 --> 02:25:06.628]  I'm actually a couple years older than him.
[02:25:08.029 --> 02:25:13.832]  He's up there with Lincoln, one of those people that you feel like you've entered a house of mirrors when you try to figure him out.
[02:25:13.872 --> 02:25:19.534]  There are a lot of us who have tried to... We looked at some of the evidence that maybe he was starting to turn.
[02:25:19.834 --> 02:25:22.295]  We knew he went to the London School of Economics.
[02:25:22.335 --> 02:25:23.856]  He was raised as a good little socialist.
[02:25:26.533 --> 02:25:28.394]  Well, I think he was a man certainly well before his time.
[02:25:28.414 --> 02:25:28.614]  I think
[02:25:54.814 --> 02:26:04.681]  I don't know if his time will ever come around again, but he was obviously very popular with the public and very unpopular in the military-industrial complex.
[02:26:04.741 --> 02:26:08.824]  And I think that brought about the greatest conflicts.
[02:26:08.864 --> 02:26:18.370]  And I think you have to view the Kennedy assassination as the link point, the watershed event that brought about an illegal change in his government.
[02:26:18.771 --> 02:26:20.372]  I remember what I wanted to bring up.
[02:26:20.432 --> 02:26:21.573]  I know my videos got to
[02:26:23.092 --> 02:26:23.953]  No, I didn't hear about that.
[02:26:23.973 --> 02:26:24.413]  That's interesting.
[02:26:54.053 --> 02:26:56.734]  Yeah, the mainstream media, of course, won't touch it, but it's in this month's Vanity Fair.
[02:26:56.814 --> 02:26:59.376]  Other than that, we wrote some articles at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:26:59.416 --> 02:27:00.497]  Do you have a comment on that?
[02:27:01.037 --> 02:27:06.000]  Well, we've been having a little bit of a difficulty with the mainstream media ourselves.
[02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:14.706]  I think the mainstream media is still slow to react to the information that I've been giving in terms of what my father told me before he died.
[02:27:16.867 --> 02:27:24.054]  You know, next week on Inside Edition, they're going to run a six or seven minute segment with these disclosures.
[02:27:24.374 --> 02:27:25.395]  So it's starting to break.
[02:27:25.455 --> 02:27:28.358]  I want to thank you for coming on with us, stjohnhunt.com.
[02:27:28.598 --> 02:27:29.479]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:27:29.659 --> 02:27:29.879]  All right.
[02:27:29.919 --> 02:27:30.380]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:27:30.700 --> 02:27:31.020]  You bet.
[02:27:31.060 --> 02:27:31.441]  Take care.
[02:27:31.781 --> 02:27:32.922]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:27:33.082 --> 02:27:33.703]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.785 --> 02:27:36.786]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.186 --> 02:27:38.807]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.827 --> 02:27:42.371]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.692 --> 02:27:50.253]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:27:50.653 --> 02:27:53.594]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:27:53.914 --> 02:27:56.475]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:27:56.835 --> 02:28:01.656]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:28:02.037 --> 02:28:07.398]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:28:07.718 --> 02:28:10.679]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:28:10.879 --> 02:28:11.439]  We're good to go.
[02:28:34.270 --> 02:28:34.711]  We're good to go.
[02:28:46.189 --> 02:28:48.670]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:28:49.211 --> 02:28:56.375]  Did you know that Bible prophecy talks about the United States, British Commonwealth, Russia, China, and the communist world in the last days?
[02:28:57.175 --> 02:29:02.818]  Did you know that it predicts a confrontation between atheistic communism and the western world of Christianity?
[02:29:03.519 --> 02:29:06.941]  The plans have already been laid and they conform to Bible prophecy.
[02:29:07.642 --> 02:29:17.176]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:29:45.492 --> 02:29:47.513]  Do you know why you get dark circles under your eyes?
[02:29:47.893 --> 02:29:50.854]  Because blood leaks out of your capillaries and pools under your skin.
[02:29:51.294 --> 02:29:51.894]  I'm not kidding.
[02:29:52.154 --> 02:29:53.394]  It's just like an ugly bruise.
[02:29:53.895 --> 02:29:58.136]  But now you can erase dark circles with a clinically proven breakthrough called Hydralyze.
[02:29:58.476 --> 02:30:05.218]  Hydralyze diminishes dark circles and tightens puffiness in bags by repairing leaky capillaries, leaving you with younger, brighter eyes.

[02:30:14.443 --> 02:30:15.785]  I don't want to put the mirror down.
[02:30:16.185 --> 02:30:18.687]  Even surgery cannot deliver these stunning results.
[02:30:19.048 --> 02:30:24.233]  Hydrolyze is so powerful, it even helps build new collagen in the skin, reducing crow's feet and wrinkles.
[02:30:24.693 --> 02:30:27.116]  Try Hydrolyze Risk-Free and see for yourself.
[02:30:27.476 --> 02:30:29.578]  My husband, he can't stop complimenting me.
[02:30:29.798 --> 02:30:31.200]  People tell me I look 10 years younger.
[02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:33.263]  You deserve younger, brighter eyes.
[02:30:33.684 --> 02:30:37.911]  Call now for your free trial of Hydrolyze and experience the transformation for yourself.
[02:30:38.292 --> 02:30:39.514]  For your free trial, call 1-800-552-1428.
[02:30:39.534 --> 02:30:39.814]  That's 1-800-552-1428.
[02:31:06.286 --> 02:31:11.309]  Texas is the front lines of the New World Order's activities here in the United States on so many fronts.
[02:31:11.349 --> 02:31:25.397]  From the Animal ID Act, to the North American Union's funding mechanism of the Trans-Texas Corridor, the NAFTA Superhighway, or the New Freedom Initiative for psychological testing and drugging of all the school-age children from age 4 to age 18.
[02:31:25.917 --> 02:31:27.998]  We are the front line in so many cases.
[02:31:28.659 --> 02:31:32.481]  Second most populous state online to surpass California in the next 10 years.
[02:31:32.501 --> 02:31:33.381]  27 million people.
[02:31:35.171 --> 02:31:36.752]  And this is happening around the country.
[02:31:36.772 --> 02:31:46.857]  We're going to be telling you about the Legislative Action Alert, dealing with doctors being able to be judge, jury, and executioner, and commit you.
[02:31:46.937 --> 02:31:49.899]  No more judge, no more jury, no more investigation.
[02:31:49.939 --> 02:31:52.380]  They'll just do whatever they want, when they want.
[02:31:54.415 --> 02:32:00.319]  Before we go to Dr. John Breeding who is here in the studio with me to cover that and then I'm also going to recap top stories before the show ends.
[02:32:00.419 --> 02:32:02.760]  Huge Larry Silverstein news just came out.
[02:32:02.800 --> 02:32:05.082]  It's on InfoWars and PresentPlanet right now.
[02:32:07.043 --> 02:32:09.224]  That's PresentPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:32:10.185 --> 02:32:15.268]  It's funny, when I finally talked to the folks at InterFood, I found out they tried to contact me about advertising of course.
[02:32:15.928 --> 02:32:17.189]  They said more than two years ago.
[02:32:18.248 --> 02:32:19.249]  Could never get a hold of me.
[02:32:19.329 --> 02:32:26.175]  That's how small my organization has been and how unfocused on even capitalizing we are, though now we realize how important that is.
[02:32:26.716 --> 02:32:32.321]  And then I found out that we're friends with George Humphreys, a former city council member, economist, good friend of mine here in Austin.
[02:32:32.921 --> 02:32:37.425]  And then I'm sitting here going, hey, I'm going to plug this interfood to Dr. Breeding sitting right across from me.
[02:32:37.885 --> 02:32:41.729]  And he goes, oh, Steve Sinclair, he's my longtime personal friend.
[02:32:43.553 --> 02:32:48.318]  Because you see, this company is now based in Colorado, but it used to be right here in Austin, Texas.
[02:32:48.378 --> 02:32:52.903]  So, these are really good anti-New World Order, pro-freedom people.
[02:32:53.504 --> 02:32:54.965]  And I do take some vitamins and things.
[02:32:55.005 --> 02:32:57.948]  I know most vitamins, even the more expensive natural ones, don't absorb well.
[02:32:58.309 --> 02:32:59.370]  It's all about the mixes.
[02:33:00.191 --> 02:33:03.694]  And I read the ingredients closely and a lot of them just taste too horrible for me to even eat.
[02:33:03.854 --> 02:33:11.700]  This is made of the best vegetables and plants and minerals and kelp and everything.
[02:33:11.980 --> 02:33:13.941]  And we've been using it for a few months now.
[02:33:14.001 --> 02:33:15.682]  My wife just goes crazy over it.
[02:33:15.963 --> 02:33:17.324]  And she's used a lot of them.
[02:33:17.784 --> 02:33:19.065]  And we hold our nose and take them.
[02:33:19.665 --> 02:33:20.406]  It doesn't taste bad.
[02:33:20.965 --> 02:33:22.405]  I'm sorry I had your mic off.
[02:33:44.430 --> 02:33:45.231]  I've been taking it.
[02:33:45.271 --> 02:33:47.892]  My wife has found that it really ups her stamina working out.
[02:33:48.152 --> 02:33:50.273]  It's something with ground up coconut and it does up your metabolism.
[02:34:07.503 --> 02:34:08.384]  Absolutely, it certainly is.
[02:34:08.404 --> 02:34:09.866]  Again, folks, it's a new sponsor.
[02:34:25.439 --> 02:34:26.100]  That's right.
[02:34:40.957 --> 02:34:41.637]  We're good to go.
[02:35:06.568 --> 02:35:11.053]  Yeah, it's got a mushroom blend that's actually in the coffee bean.
[02:35:11.073 --> 02:35:11.754]  It's a unique deal.
[02:35:11.774 --> 02:35:15.097]  And so drinking this coffee is way better for you than drinking regular coffee.
[02:35:29.311 --> 02:35:36.714]  Yeah, they've got a whole product line and my wife's bonkers over it and it really is good stuff and it's also very well priced.
[02:35:37.134 --> 02:35:39.155]  So that's interfood.com or 866-762-9238.
[02:35:39.175 --> 02:35:43.057]  Give them a call today.
[02:35:43.957 --> 02:35:46.258]  Going to Dr. John Breeding.
[02:35:46.698 --> 02:35:50.440]  Dr. Breeding, I have the actual bill here in front of me.
[02:35:51.585 --> 02:35:55.726]  And I also, let me just read over this first and then have you, the expert, go over this.
[02:35:55.746 --> 02:35:58.167]  And I'm glad you made a special trip down Sunday.
[02:35:58.187 --> 02:35:59.627]  Or I guess it was Saturday.
[02:35:59.667 --> 02:36:05.968]  I got here Saturday night to do editing work and they said, hey, a guy came to the door and tacked this up and said it was important.
[02:36:06.489 --> 02:36:07.809]  And I said, okay, let me see it.
[02:36:07.889 --> 02:36:09.069]  And boy, is it important.
[02:36:09.089 --> 02:36:10.169]  Then I went and read the bill.
[02:36:10.990 --> 02:36:14.871]  And your little handwritten note was that I need your help with this one.
[02:36:15.311 --> 02:36:16.771]  This is the worst thing I've seen yet.
[02:36:17.794 --> 02:36:18.214]  And it is.
[02:36:18.294 --> 02:36:21.275]  Every day it comes to some new horror.
[02:36:21.675 --> 02:36:23.635]  Legislative alert, you're action needed immediately.
[02:36:24.015 --> 02:36:25.616]  Your civil liberties are at risk.
[02:36:25.676 --> 02:36:27.556]  It goes on House Bill 405 in Texas.
[02:36:27.916 --> 02:36:29.937]  It's moving rapidly through the Texas Legislature.
[02:36:30.217 --> 02:36:33.718]  This bill is the biggest threat to civil liberties that we've seen in many years.
[02:36:33.738 --> 02:36:40.959]  It allows an emergency room physician to detain you for 24 hours without a warrant, without a court order, without any involvement from law enforcement.
[02:36:41.319 --> 02:36:44.600]  Imagine you showing up at the hospital, they're going to turn them into prisoners, which is the plan.
[02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:45.781]  We're good to go.
[02:37:03.752 --> 02:37:04.893]  According to Sgt.
[02:37:04.933 --> 02:37:10.598]  Kitty Hicks of the Texas Travis County Sheriff's Department, mental health deputies are often called to emergency rooms.
[02:37:10.638 --> 02:37:21.367]  She wrote that according to her statistics, out of all the calls they get from emergency rooms, maybe 2-3% of them would the deputies take and commit the person, even though the medical doctor disagrees.
[02:37:21.986 --> 02:37:23.628]  Folks, this goes into so many things.
[02:37:23.648 --> 02:37:26.812]  This plugs into destroying the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[02:37:27.473 --> 02:37:37.305]  We have now guidance coming out from the Food and Drug Administration admitting massive increases in suicide and violent psychotic breaks on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[02:37:37.585 --> 02:37:39.788]  We told you this for so many years.
[02:37:40.928 --> 02:37:45.571]  Now, they're saying, oh, it's really bad for young people now, and it isn't as bad when you get older.
[02:37:45.591 --> 02:37:49.614]  But you actually read, it's very bad when you get older, just you have more self-control.
[02:37:51.095 --> 02:37:53.256]  The point is, they get kids on drugs and there's more suicide.
[02:37:53.416 --> 02:37:58.299]  And they say, oh, we've got a crisis, we've got to have more testing to put 50% on the drugs, then there'll be more suicide.
[02:37:58.639 --> 02:38:01.841]  I mean, just everything they do is about ensnaring us in the system.
[02:38:01.941 --> 02:38:06.104]  Walk us through this, Dr. Breeding, what they're doing, because this is, I've read the bill.
[02:38:06.424 --> 02:38:09.766]  I mean, I've got it here, right in front of me, and it is just off the charts.
[02:38:11.545 --> 02:38:18.167]  Yeah, the legislature's really taken major steps backwards in terms of civil liberties and human rights right now.
[02:38:18.207 --> 02:38:35.094]  You know, they already passed a bill that expanded the order of protective custody from 24 to 48 hours where a cop can have you detained for 24 hours, but at least then you've got the mental health cops from the Sheriff's Department that are involved and at least they have some discernment that they're supposed to be doing there.
[02:38:35.494 --> 02:38:38.995]  What even the Sheriff's Departments are saying right now, you mentioned Kitty Hicks,
[02:38:39.620 --> 02:38:43.122]  The other Sheriff Sorensen from Round Rock has testified on this thing.
[02:38:43.502 --> 02:38:50.466]  They're saying that 98 out of 100 of the referrals that are made by the ER docs are invalid even by their standards.
[02:38:50.907 --> 02:38:54.028]  And what that means is that more and more people sent right over.
[02:38:54.048 --> 02:38:56.630]  See what the docs want is to get people out of the hospital.
[02:38:56.750 --> 02:39:01.171]  We've had listeners that pull up to clinics with 9-11 stickers and they call the mental health people on them.
[02:39:01.771 --> 02:39:09.893]  You know, 9-11 inside job stickers or people don't want their baby to have shots when they're newborn with all the mercury and they call CPS and say you're mentally ill.
[02:39:10.353 --> 02:39:11.353]  I mean, there's no law here.
[02:39:11.373 --> 02:39:12.534]  This is just a whole new thing.
[02:39:12.974 --> 02:39:21.896]  There's no law and this makes a doc, a cop, and a judge and a jury, like you said, it takes somebody, locks them up for 24 hours.
[02:39:21.976 --> 02:39:23.096]  Once you're in that system,
[02:39:23.914 --> 02:39:32.802]  You're vulnerable because anybody can declare, based on their opinion, that you're... Everything started in Nazi Germany, as you know, with the psychiatrists and psychologists and doctors.
[02:39:33.142 --> 02:39:33.923]  Same thing in Russia.
[02:39:34.844 --> 02:39:41.350]  By the way, in China, every day I read about this guy didn't agree with the government, so he's now in a mental health camp.
[02:39:42.774 --> 02:39:44.935]  Yeah, the psych lobby is really strong.
[02:39:45.316 --> 02:39:47.577]  The psych hospital lobby is really strong.
[02:39:47.637 --> 02:39:49.478]  Somehow they pushed this thing through the house.
[02:39:49.778 --> 02:39:53.821]  We have about two days to kill this thing in the Senate by making a big noise.
[02:39:54.241 --> 02:39:57.463]  Basically it says ER docs can detain you based on their opinion.
[02:39:57.503 --> 02:40:01.285]  They can triple range private transport, take you to the psych lockup.
[02:40:02.106 --> 02:40:05.268]  They are provided immunity from prosecution.
[02:40:05.288 --> 02:40:07.149]  In other words, you cannot go back and sue them.
[02:40:07.842 --> 02:40:10.829]  For that action, it's a setup for disaster.
[02:40:10.849 --> 02:40:15.579]  98% of the cases even by the standard mental health practices are invalid.
[02:40:16.835 --> 02:40:20.178]  Most of the docs I've talked to don't want to be cops.
[02:40:20.859 --> 02:40:24.582]  You know, the judges, even the probate, mental health court judges are against this.
[02:40:24.862 --> 02:40:26.143]  The advocacy groups, everybody.
[02:40:26.203 --> 02:40:31.348]  We need to shake these senators up and let them know that this is not going to happen in Texas.
[02:40:31.688 --> 02:40:38.794]  We need help from everybody in Texas, but we also need help from everybody around the country who's listening that wants to not have this set as a precedent.
[02:40:38.874 --> 02:40:41.197]  And by the way, Alex says Texas leads the way.
[02:40:41.357 --> 02:40:42.618]  They do, and in a few days,
[02:40:43.218 --> 02:40:45.119]  We're trying as fast as we can to get this up on the web.
[02:40:45.139 --> 02:40:46.040]  Hopefully it'll go viral.
[02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:48.822]  You can be assured, folks, I've seen this in similar states.
[02:40:48.842 --> 02:40:49.842]  They're trying to pass it.
[02:40:50.142 --> 02:40:52.184]  They're going to continue to try to pass it here in Texas.
[02:40:52.804 --> 02:40:56.106]  This is going to be an ongoing fight, so this is an alarm bell for the rest of the country.
[02:40:56.386 --> 02:41:02.390]  You know, we're kind of on the outpost when the enemy comes in like a flood, but you can know when we ring the alarm bell, this is for the whole country.
[02:41:02.810 --> 02:41:03.030]  Right.
[02:41:03.471 --> 02:41:04.471]  So we have two numbers.
[02:41:05.312 --> 02:41:06.953]  It's the Texas Lieutenant Governor,
[02:41:08.573 --> 02:41:12.976]  Number, I'm going to give the area code too, because anybody anywhere can call and help us with this.
[02:41:13.056 --> 02:41:14.556]  It's area code 512.
[02:41:15.457 --> 02:41:15.977]  The number is 463-0001.
[02:41:15.997 --> 02:41:16.037]  512-463-0001.
[02:41:16.117 --> 02:41:16.998]  Opposing House Bill 405.
[02:41:17.538 --> 02:41:25.662]  The other number is Senator Nelson, the chair of the committee that this is going to go to in the Senate.
[02:41:25.683 --> 02:41:25.943]  Area code 512.
[02:41:38.186 --> 02:41:41.708]  4630112.
[02:41:38.206 --> 02:41:41.708]  4630112.
[02:41:40.167 --> 02:41:41.708]  Oppose House Bill 405.
[02:41:41.988 --> 02:41:44.610]  This is an assault on civil liberties.
[02:41:45.451 --> 02:41:46.472]  This needs to stop.
[02:41:46.812 --> 02:41:47.532]  That's the message.
[02:41:47.572 --> 02:41:48.313]  It's real simple.
[02:41:51.457 --> 02:41:53.718]  I mean, as if the police aren't already overwhelmed.
[02:41:53.818 --> 02:41:58.959]  Now we're going to have them having to go at any time some doctor or medical worker who's on a power trip.
[02:41:59.319 --> 02:42:00.620]  And I mean, seriously, this keeps coming up.
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:02.220]  There's a lot of great doctors, a lot of great nurses.
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:03.520]  Same thing when I'm bashing the police.
[02:42:03.881 --> 02:42:06.321]  It's not you individually, it's the system.
[02:42:07.762 --> 02:42:10.062]  You know, there's even some good psychiatrists and psychologists out there.
[02:42:10.082 --> 02:42:12.843]  The point is, on average, a lot of them are control freak nuts.
[02:42:13.683 --> 02:42:17.684]  And, you know, doctors already think they're God, because they're so used to that.
[02:42:17.865 --> 02:42:19.325]  And we just need to put a stop to this.
[02:42:20.046 --> 02:42:22.347]  I mean, we need to put a stop to this and put a stop to this now.
[02:42:22.747 --> 02:42:23.147]  That's right.
[02:42:23.167 --> 02:42:29.228]  A lot of times, the ER doc, he just wants him out of the hospital because he's already overloaded in the emergency room.
[02:42:29.528 --> 02:42:30.408]  So he said, I'll just shove it on.
[02:42:30.428 --> 02:42:43.691]  Well, you're also going to have people that are being disruptive or unruly when their finger's chopped off or when they got the flu or when they're dehydrated or when they're going into diabetic shock and they're throwing fits.
[02:42:44.091 --> 02:42:46.612]  I mean, folks, how many of you have been sick before and it's been hard to deal with?
[02:42:47.678 --> 02:42:49.100]  I mean, frankly, I have been before.
[02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:49.860]  You got it.
[02:42:50.081 --> 02:42:50.541]  You got it.
[02:42:50.821 --> 02:42:51.021]  Yeah.
[02:42:51.442 --> 02:43:01.111]  At least 40-50% of the people who get diagnosed with psychiatric labels have some verifiable, treatable medical condition that's going unseen.
[02:43:02.074 --> 02:43:10.996]  And part of what this thing does too, apart from just the huge Civil Liberties thing and the Human Rights thing, which is enough... This is a whole new CPS for adults and kids.
[02:43:11.176 --> 02:43:12.277]  This is going to be used by CPS.
[02:43:12.357 --> 02:43:14.997]  And it's going to scare people away who really need help.
[02:43:15.337 --> 02:43:19.678]  You want to go see a doc because you need help, not because they're the cops and they might detain you.
[02:43:20.138 --> 02:43:28.160]  Well, I mean, I've had the flu before, the walking flu, and I've been stumbling around, you know, seeing Mickey Mouse basically, but nobody went and committed me.
[02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:30.141]  It was because I hadn't had any water in four days.
[02:43:30.581 --> 02:43:30.781]  Yeah.
[02:43:31.162 --> 02:43:35.807]  So we're down there at the legislature fighting this and right now I'm saying we need your help.
[02:43:36.388 --> 02:43:45.879]  Last year, last session, you guys helped us kill the New Freedom Commission's implementation in the legislature by putting thousands of calls into the switchboards there.
[02:43:46.119 --> 02:43:47.681]  We need that right now on this one.
[02:43:47.901 --> 02:43:48.362]  House Bill 405.
[02:43:50.077 --> 02:43:52.339]  Lieutenant Governor Erica 512-463-0001.
[02:43:52.359 --> 02:43:52.399]  512-463-0001.
[02:43:52.799 --> 02:44:05.408]  We're going to get these numbers posted up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPundit.com right now as soon as I can get a hold of my guys and get that done.
[02:44:05.428 --> 02:44:06.549]  They do such a fabulous job.
[02:44:06.569 --> 02:44:08.570]  I wanted to shift gears and we'll go back into this in a moment.
[02:44:08.731 --> 02:44:09.931]  Okay.
[02:44:10.012 --> 02:44:11.873]  USA Today today had the headline
[02:44:12.722 --> 02:44:13.882]  I'm trying to find the actual article.
[02:44:13.922 --> 02:44:14.903]  I've got Yahoo News.
[02:44:14.923 --> 02:44:16.043]  They've all got different articles.
[02:44:16.563 --> 02:44:16.903]  Where'd it go?
[02:44:16.983 --> 02:44:17.463]  I just had it.
[02:44:17.503 --> 02:44:17.824]  Here it is.
[02:44:18.164 --> 02:44:18.904]  This is Yahoo.
[02:44:18.924 --> 02:44:20.804]  That's all I can find right now.
[02:44:20.904 --> 02:44:23.465]  Teachers stage fake gun attack on kids.
[02:44:23.865 --> 02:44:24.866]  These are sixth graders.
[02:44:24.926 --> 02:44:26.366]  They didn't tell them they were going to do it.
[02:44:26.626 --> 02:44:28.907]  They turned the lights off and said, a man's coming to kill you.
[02:44:28.927 --> 02:44:30.447]  He was wearing a black mask.
[02:44:30.507 --> 02:44:32.568]  The children cried and screamed and thought they were about to die.
[02:44:32.928 --> 02:44:33.788]  This went on and on.
[02:44:34.088 --> 02:44:36.669]  They're doing these drills, federally funded, all over the country.
[02:44:38.107 --> 02:44:40.088]  This is classic trauma-based mind control.
[02:44:40.108 --> 02:44:45.552]  I'm telling folks NCI torture manuals that have been classified from the 60s, Copper, Green and others.
[02:44:45.572 --> 02:44:47.253]  They have different continuances of torture.
[02:44:47.673 --> 02:44:55.519]  The next to worst to actually waterboarding where you actually physically are dying is the threat of death and putting you in blindfolds and saying they're going to blow your head off.
[02:44:56.540 --> 02:45:12.951]  As a psychologist, I mean, your take on this, when they just calmly have federal drills, coast to coast, federally funded drills, where they come in unannounced, in some cases with third graders, screaming with guns to their heads, teachers have had to go to psychiatric facilities, people don't even tell teachers in some cases, this time though it was teachers doing it, not even cops.
[02:45:13.271 --> 02:45:14.132]  What do you have to say about that?
[02:45:15.953 --> 02:45:20.016]  It's awful, you know, what everybody needs to remember, and always remember, is that
[02:45:21.525 --> 02:45:22.205]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:45:38.735 --> 02:45:39.316]  We're good to go.
[02:46:02.152 --> 02:46:04.814]  Well, I mean, I have the articles for listeners that don't believe this.
[02:46:04.994 --> 02:46:09.177]  In Michigan, they ran up and put fake blood on them and said they were going to be killed.
[02:46:09.578 --> 02:46:12.019]  And I mean, the kids literally defecate all over themselves.
[02:46:12.039 --> 02:46:12.880]  I mean, this is terror.
[02:46:13.260 --> 02:46:15.742]  And I've seen video of them pointing guns and they're crying and begging.
[02:46:16.062 --> 02:46:18.444]  I mean, that is literal, that is classical.
[02:46:18.624 --> 02:46:21.166]  When you read about the CIA mind control, that is what they do.
[02:46:21.226 --> 02:46:27.851]  I mean, this is so off the charts and the principals are in the papers going, well, it's for their safety, they need to know how to respond.
[02:46:28.171 --> 02:46:28.411]  Yeah.
[02:46:28.431 --> 02:46:30.373]  But then when there's really a shooting, the cops won't go in.
[02:46:30.633 --> 02:46:30.833]  Yeah.
[02:46:31.154 --> 02:46:31.294]  Yeah.
[02:46:31.714 --> 02:46:36.118]  The end result of the conditioning warning level is that authority equals terror.
[02:46:36.718 --> 02:46:42.644]  So you're conditioned to be terrified of authority, which makes you passive, obedient, unwilling to speak out in challenge.
[02:46:42.924 --> 02:46:45.726]  You know, it's the same thing with being afraid of an ER doctor.
[02:46:45.746 --> 02:46:46.507]  They might commit you.
[02:46:46.867 --> 02:46:49.289]  Being afraid of any kind of authority that they might unleash.
[02:46:49.309 --> 02:46:50.410]  Which might isolate everybody.
[02:46:50.691 --> 02:46:51.491]  It isolates you.
[02:46:51.732 --> 02:46:52.572]  It makes you afraid.
[02:46:52.632 --> 02:46:53.453]  It makes you passive.
[02:46:53.493 --> 02:46:54.254]  It makes you timid.
[02:46:54.875 --> 02:46:58.318]  That's the end result, and that's very much a mind control and conditioning dynamic.
[02:46:58.919 --> 02:47:00.681]  And again, it's the feds paying for this.
[02:47:00.761 --> 02:47:03.924]  I don't even think the cops locally and the teachers know what they're doing.
[02:47:04.324 --> 02:47:05.205]  They just take the money.
[02:47:05.225 --> 02:47:09.830]  I mean, some of these grants are like $100,000 to go terrorize people, but it's always unannounced.
[02:47:10.530 --> 02:47:16.176]  Can you imagine your 9-year-old, the door busts open and men come running and screaming at guns, I'm going to kill you?
[02:47:16.855 --> 02:47:25.157]  Well, this sounds really extreme, but if you just back it up and think about all the teachers who are going along with this thing called high-stakes accountability testing.
[02:47:25.577 --> 02:47:35.979]  This whole perversion of the educational system with these tax tests and this teaching to the test and this whole system and going along with it even though they don't like it, even though they know it interferes with real teaching.
[02:47:35.999 --> 02:47:37.639]  These Prussian brainwashing models.
[02:47:38.239 --> 02:47:43.540]  The people who participate in those systems tend to be conditioned to go along with the system.
[02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:49.065]  You know, and to obey the authority and not to be too loud and raucous about resisting it.
[02:47:49.085 --> 02:47:55.852]  Well, the Prussians literally bred the Hessians, the mercenary slaves, that were under such mind control, it wasn't like a black slave would run off if you let him go.
[02:47:56.152 --> 02:47:57.573]  These Germans were proud to be slaves.
[02:47:57.613 --> 02:47:58.594]  They were actual slaves.
[02:47:58.975 --> 02:47:59.715]  Warrior slaves.
[02:47:59.976 --> 02:48:01.998]  And that's where they developed Kindergarten.
[02:48:02.278 --> 02:48:05.401]  And it was the by-rote brainwashing to make them, you know,
[02:48:05.461 --> 02:48:06.481]  No, I don't.
[02:48:27.666 --> 02:48:34.113]  Emergency room docs, the power to detain my brothers and sisters because they have the opinion that they need to be detained.
[02:48:34.393 --> 02:48:34.994]  Exactly.
[02:48:35.735 --> 02:48:37.176]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:37.196 --> 02:48:42.562]  There are procedures for people that are clearly out of their heads, and those should be followed, not some new layer.
[02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:54.386]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.767 --> 02:49:02.375]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.095 --> 02:49:10.138]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.538 --> 02:49:22.003]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.283 --> 02:49:25.785]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.245 --> 02:49:28.166]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.506 --> 02:49:32.348]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:45.481 --> 02:49:50.582]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:49:50.642 --> 02:49:57.944]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:49:58.104 --> 02:50:08.726]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:50:08.926 --> 02:50:13.467]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:50:13.747 --> 02:50:18.750]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:50:18.950 --> 02:50:21.891]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:22.111 --> 02:50:31.936]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:50:45.498 --> 02:50:47.219]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:47.439 --> 02:50:51.140]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.

[02:51:00.544 --> 02:51:05.446]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:05.646 --> 02:51:14.671]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[02:51:52.976 --> 02:51:55.797]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:56.798 --> 02:52:00.179]  I tell you, this broadcast today went by at warp speed.
[02:52:00.199 --> 02:52:01.560]  Final segment with Dr. Breeding.
[02:52:01.600 --> 02:52:02.680]  Final segment, period.
[02:52:03.101 --> 02:52:04.781]  They're also voting on Animal ID Act.
[02:52:04.901 --> 02:52:07.122]  They're having a big committee meeting today on that.
[02:52:08.963 --> 02:52:09.343]  In E1.012.
[02:52:09.583 --> 02:52:14.686]  And that's going on at 3 p.m.
[02:52:14.726 --> 02:52:17.627]  So that's in about an hour and five minutes at the Capitol.
[02:52:18.562 --> 02:52:21.165]  HB 461, federally tagging everything.
[02:52:21.925 --> 02:52:23.687]  The Big Agra doesn't have to make all the changes.
[02:52:23.767 --> 02:52:27.591]  It's meant to shut all the small farms and ranches down and shut organic farming down.
[02:52:28.432 --> 02:52:29.673]  They're moving on every level.
[02:52:29.993 --> 02:52:41.264]  Dr. Breeden, you have statistics here from the police departments from the state of Texas about up in the police state of Round Rock, how many times the doctors called the crisis intervention team up there, just in a little town north of us.
[02:52:41.952 --> 02:52:44.453]  Yeah, Sergeant Sorensen sent us this data.
[02:52:44.493 --> 02:52:48.815]  He's really against this bill for the same reasons of overwhelm and inappropriateness.
[02:52:49.295 --> 02:52:56.578]  Just one hospital, Ramrock Hospital, last year, 556 referrals for mental health referrals.
[02:52:56.598 --> 02:53:01.921]  That means the sheriff's deputies, mental health deputies are called in 556 times just in that one hospital.
[02:53:02.281 --> 02:53:05.082]  Now considering that 98% of those calls are invalid,
[02:53:05.791 --> 02:53:08.372]  What you're talking about is maybe 10 or 12 of those people.
[02:53:20.427 --> 02:53:20.667]  I don't
[02:53:39.036 --> 02:53:43.443]  Probably tomorrow or the next day in the Senate Human Health and Services Committee, House Bill 405.
[02:53:43.924 --> 02:53:46.528]  We want you to call the Lieutenant Governor 512-463-0001.
[02:53:51.662 --> 02:53:56.403]  And the chair of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, Jane Nelson, 512-463-0112.
[02:53:56.423 --> 02:53:56.723]  512-463-0112.
[02:53:57.483 --> 02:54:04.025]  If you're from Texas, tell them to stop the bill.
[02:54:04.065 --> 02:54:12.867]  If you're from anywhere else, tell them you don't want a president anywhere in this country, which at least in name is supposed to be about liberty and freedom and that you're fighting for that.
[02:54:13.147 --> 02:54:14.508]  Stop House Bill 405.
[02:54:14.888 --> 02:54:16.028]  Please make those calls for us.
[02:54:17.049 --> 02:54:17.750]  Absolutely.
[02:54:17.890 --> 02:54:20.934]  Again, Dr. Breeding, I want to thank you for coming in today.
[02:54:20.954 --> 02:54:22.777]  We're going to be posting an article about this.
[02:54:22.817 --> 02:54:28.765]  We'll also post the text of that alert that's got the phone numbers up on the site as soon as the show ends.
[02:54:29.686 --> 02:54:30.667]  So again, thank you for coming in.
[02:54:30.687 --> 02:54:31.328]  Thanks, man.
[02:54:32.049 --> 02:54:34.791]  I'll tell you, that stuff with the guns to the heads, they're doing it all over.
[02:54:35.731 --> 02:54:38.933]  It's just beyond terrible.
[02:54:39.374 --> 02:54:40.254]  There's no end to it.
[02:54:40.554 --> 02:54:45.157]  Ladies and gentlemen, huge article up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[02:54:45.658 --> 02:54:48.639]  Larry Silverstein warned not to come into work on 9-11.
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:49.860]  This has now come out.
[02:54:49.900 --> 02:54:54.383]  They've also learned that that was a Larry Silverstein security man, claiming they were police.
[02:54:54.423 --> 02:54:58.946]  The one claiming he had a bomb has now been fired, according to Silverstein Security.
[02:55:00.303 --> 02:55:10.329]  But the bigger news here is this statement about being warned not to go into work from Larry Silverstein's security people that dovetails with what it looks like they're surveilling what we're doing.
[02:55:10.349 --> 02:55:15.012]  They put out a story Friday in the Wall Street Journal saying, oh yeah, you had to go to the doctor that day.
[02:55:15.352 --> 02:55:18.073]  A Wall Street Journal article about Larry Silverstein going to the doctor.
[02:55:18.674 --> 02:55:20.555]  I mean, that is an obvious pre-positioning.
[02:55:21.275 --> 02:55:23.116]  This stuff is really, really getting bad.
[02:55:23.497 --> 02:55:25.658]  We didn't have time to play the audio and the video.
[02:55:27.248 --> 02:55:30.071]  Uh, of a new BBC, uh, Building 7 report.
[02:55:31.732 --> 02:55:39.198]  And in that whole area, uh, we have the giant report out of USA Today that we've, uh, analyzed and recapped with flashbacks, what's really behind it.
[02:55:39.718 --> 02:55:48.926]  They keep acting like they keep having these brainwashing terror drills to terrorize the children how to submit to the tyranny that is just happening organically all over the nation at these schools.
[02:55:49.046 --> 02:55:51.148]  No, it's federal grants and we have the documents.
[02:55:52.225 --> 02:55:52.605]  I think so.
[02:56:12.518 --> 02:56:14.399]  And we'll see you back tomorrow at the same time.
[02:56:15.019 --> 02:56:20.121]  Don't forget we have a free podcast of the show that serves out at the end of each show at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:20.161 --> 02:56:21.061]  And please get my films.
[02:56:21.081 --> 02:56:21.842]  That's how you support us.
[02:56:22.082 --> 02:56:22.842]  Thanks for all the support.
[02:56:22.862 --> 02:56:23.562]  God bless you all.
