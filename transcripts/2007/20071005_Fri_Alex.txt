[00:00:05.658 --> 00:00:09.861]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:11.342]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:13.043]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.643 --> 00:00:17.306]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:21.929]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.161]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:44.981]  Welcome.
[00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:49.805]  There have been new big developments in the Ed and Elaine Brown case.
[00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.328]  In the last few minutes, the feds ended a
[00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:58.675]  Press conference that was not carried by local radio or TV that we could find.
[00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:09.385]  We are waiting for either individuals that were at the press conference, local patriots, local members of the truth community, to call into this show to let us know what happened.
[00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:15.010]  We're waiting for the mainstream media to file stories on what the feds reportedly said,
[00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:28.474]  The local TV stations generally post later file reports with snippets from the news conferences, so you will be assured that in the next three hours during this transmission, we will detail exactly what happened to them.
[00:01:28.774 --> 00:01:29.555]  We know this.
[00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:39.458]  At around 7.30 Eastern last night, the Feds in over 40 SUVs descended on the Browns' home.
[00:01:40.698 --> 00:01:42.999]  They claim that no violence took place.
[00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:44.599]  The neighbors say they didn't hear shots.
[00:01:44.659 --> 00:02:02.325]  That sounds like, that's the way I figured the feds would take them if they were successful, quote, local patriots visiting them that were able to get in, that the feds opened the roadblocks for, would then draw down on them, taser them from behind, beat them from behind, you know, put guns to their heads and apprehend them that way.
[00:02:03.564 --> 00:02:09.328]  I do not yet know if that is the case, but I'd say there's about a 90% chance that that is the case.
[00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:20.517]  We hope that's the case because they could have actually been violent with them with firearms and then just told the neighbors to lie or the neighbors may not have heard the gunshots if they were inside watching television.
[00:02:21.457 --> 00:02:23.699]  We don't know exactly what happened.
[00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:31.225]  The AP, Reuters, the local newspapers are reporting a tense five-month standoff ended peacefully last night when U.S.
[00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:32.846]  Marshals took custody of
[00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:37.647]  Convicted tax evaders Ed and Elaine Brown at their Plainfield home, authorities announced.
[00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:40.867]  We had no identification that the Browns intended to voluntarily surrender.
[00:02:41.308 --> 00:02:41.508]  U.S.
[00:02:41.548 --> 00:02:48.429]  Marshal Stephen Monnier said in a statement, so we had to move forward with an operation that promised the safest possible outcome.
[00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.849]  That day was today.
[00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.070]  The arrest occurred without incident around 745.
[00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.411]  He said, high-profile situations like this are always difficult, but they don't have to be tragic.
[00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:04.750]  I'm glad no one was injured and that the community remained safe throughout the operation, Monnier said.
[00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.711]  The Browns were turned over to the U.S.
[00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:12.836]  Bureau of Prisons last night and will begin serving their 63-month federal prison term, Monnier said, in June.
[00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:17.120]  He said the Browns would eventually be charged with obstruction of justice for resisting arrest.
[00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:21.363]  Now, this is stuff he said last night.
[00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:26.207]  This came out in the early morning hours.
[00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:29.069]  This Boston Globe report is nine hours old.
[00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.701]  So I guess that came out about 2 or 3 in the morning.
[00:03:32.762 --> 00:03:36.185]  Were you at the press conference there at the federal courthouse?
[00:03:38.027 --> 00:03:39.688]  Have you seen local news reports?
[00:03:39.808 --> 00:03:41.970]  Because, again, there's too much for us to keep track of here.
[00:03:42.571 --> 00:03:49.177]  Specifically, if you have documented evidence of what they said at the press conference that we don't even know took place an hour ago.
[00:03:49.217 --> 00:03:50.698]  They said they would do it last night.
[00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.580]  Were you there in Plainfield?
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.841]  Can you call in right now?
[00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:54.902]  Please, don't call in.
[00:03:56.236 --> 00:04:03.420]  About any other subject right now, I want to know about this.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.660]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.344]  We don't normally screen calls, but John, find out what they're calling about.
[00:04:10.364 --> 00:04:11.064]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:11.845 --> 00:04:14.586]  Obviously, I have a lot of other really big news to cover here.
[00:04:15.947 --> 00:04:25.152]  And coming up on the show today, we have Dave Mustang, the lead singer, the founder,
[00:04:26.076 --> 00:04:31.499]  The writer for Megadeth, reportedly going to be joining us.
[00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:32.359]  He's on the road.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.521]  And they guarantee if it isn't today, it'll be Monday.
[00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:38.463]  But we'll see if Dave Mustang joins us.
[00:04:38.523 --> 00:04:41.784]  Generally, these hard-to-pin-down guests do.
[00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:43.585]  And why?
[00:04:43.645 --> 00:04:45.887]  Because he's come out with an anti-New World Order album.
[00:04:47.627 --> 00:04:52.670]  But what's interesting is, he was doing anti-New World Order albums 16, 17, 18 years ago.
[00:04:55.988 --> 00:04:57.789]  So we'll be talking to Dave Mustang today.
[00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:00.270]  Ron Paul, too, in the second hour.
[00:05:03.111 --> 00:05:04.171]  The war on terrorism.
[00:05:04.492 --> 00:05:07.273]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:05:07.533 --> 00:05:11.694]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:05:12.115 --> 00:05:12.935]  So what do you do?
[00:05:13.255 --> 00:05:17.837]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:20.439]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.821]  Sheltering in Place!
[00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:35.634]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:05:35.674 --> 00:05:42.741]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:47.488]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:05:47.928 --> 00:05:49.711]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:05:49.731 --> 00:05:49.951]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:05:50.031 --> 00:05:51.574]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:06:04.372 --> 00:06:09.858]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:17.807]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.536 --> 00:06:25.600]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:37.387]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.728 --> 00:06:41.390]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.651]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.951 --> 00:06:47.734]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:02.927 --> 00:07:08.889]  Each night when you sleep, your body uses the time to restore itself so that you could wake up feeling renewed.
[00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:11.810]  But wouldn't it be nice to also wake up looking younger?
[00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:20.013]  Now there's NightSkin, a serum that goes on while you sleep to reduce age spots, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and moisturize the skin.
[00:07:20.553 --> 00:07:27.095]  NightSkin was made by Dr. Arthur Perry, a board-certified cosmetic surgeon, as an alternative to some invasive surgeries.
[00:07:27.595 --> 00:07:32.819]  It has real ingredients that have been shown to reduce the signs of aging and fight natural sun damage.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.081]  All while you get a good night's sleep.
[00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:40.785]  Try NightSkin today and see what it's like to wake up feeling renewed both inside and out.

[00:07:44.208 --> 00:07:48.811]  NightSkin is guaranteed to renew your skin overnight.
[00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:51.293]  Turning back the clock has never been this easy.
[00:07:51.653 --> 00:07:53.595]  Try NightSkin risk-free today.
[00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:54.375]  Call 1-800-894-3418.
[00:07:57.537 --> 00:07:59.778]  That's 1-800-894-3418.
[00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:08.461]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.081 --> 00:08:12.122]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.804 --> 00:08:22.385]  I've been a little busy today.
[00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:33.074]  Because I found out that somebody in the chain of custody in Austin or in New York ripped off a copy of Endgame and we're starting to put it up on the web.
[00:08:33.374 --> 00:08:37.617]  I guess they mean well, but that will really devastate us here if someone does that.
[00:08:38.377 --> 00:08:44.281]  I mean, we put this stuff out for free, but first we've got to sell a few DVDs and have it for members, folks, in higher quality.
[00:08:44.621 --> 00:08:46.943]  So I've been busy dealing with that, scrabbling around.
[00:08:47.423 --> 00:08:49.104]  And don't worry, it's been taken down, folks.
[00:08:49.164 --> 00:08:51.106]  And I've been scanning for it.
[00:08:51.126 --> 00:08:52.807]  It had been up a few hours before I caught it.
[00:08:54.497 --> 00:08:56.798]  I mean, stuff like that happens, there won't be a film to come.
[00:08:56.818 --> 00:08:57.218]  You understand?
[00:08:57.258 --> 00:09:03.621]  We're that close to the margin of being able to operate here.
[00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:06.883]  But that's a side issue.
[00:09:08.004 --> 00:09:15.487]  Whoever does that, or whoever's got copies, if I catch you distributing copies before it comes out, I'm going to come after you.
[00:09:17.388 --> 00:09:18.228]  So you need to know that.
[00:09:18.288 --> 00:09:21.410]  I spent 14 months, and let's just say,
[00:09:22.877 --> 00:09:24.699]  Well over what Terror Storm cost.
[00:09:24.719 --> 00:09:25.860]  I don't even want to say how much.
[00:09:27.121 --> 00:09:27.441]  Okay?
[00:09:27.941 --> 00:09:31.324]  I have exhausted my limited treasury making Endgame.
[00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:35.167]  And I need to make money back so I can make another film.
[00:09:39.791 --> 00:09:43.333]  Anyways, I was just enraged early this morning to discover this.
[00:09:44.254 --> 00:09:45.315]  Totally enraged.
[00:09:51.135 --> 00:09:53.677]  And then I was very upset to hear about what happened to Browns.
[00:09:54.497 --> 00:09:58.560]  We've got Dave Mustang of Megadeth coming up later because he's gone totally anti-New World Order.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.062]  And it looks like 9-11 Truth will have him on, Lord willing.
[00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:06.465]  Ron Paul will be on with us in the second hour today as well.
[00:10:06.985 --> 00:10:11.088]  We have two notoriously sketchy guests popping in, and I'm sure one of them will.
[00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:13.509]  These are both busy.
[00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:19.333]  One of them's on the road, one of them's in Congress right now, and running a presidential campaign, and just raised close to six mil
[00:10:20.327 --> 00:10:20.667]  I think so.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:47.823]  But in the first segment I was saying we couldn't find the newscast online, we couldn't find the press conference by the Feds.
[00:10:47.903 --> 00:10:49.143]  Paul Watson did.
[00:10:49.683 --> 00:10:52.124]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:10:52.144 --> 00:10:58.486]  Paul Watson was able to find the press conference, he was able to find the reports.
[00:10:59.281 --> 00:11:12.766]  And so, oh, Steve Watson was as well, so it's up on Infowars.net, that's Infowars.net, originating at Infowars.net, and on PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:20.149]  Browns were duped by Trojan horse marshals posing as supporters, open door policy allowed officials,
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.421]  You mean Feds to walk in and arrest Ed and Elaine Brown.
[00:11:25.801 --> 00:11:28.342]  Tax protesters Ed and Elaine Brown were tricked by U.S.
[00:11:28.382 --> 00:11:31.703]  Marshals who entered their home yesterday afternoon posing as supporters.
[00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:33.023]  And I kept saying that.
[00:11:33.743 --> 00:11:36.084]  I mean, you know, you'll have the Browns with 20 people around them.
[00:11:36.544 --> 00:11:38.185]  That pistol in your belt meant nothing.
[00:11:38.565 --> 00:11:41.286]  And they're just going to pull it out and pistol whip you and it's going to be the end of it.
[00:11:41.306 --> 00:11:45.887]  Remember I said 10 minutes ago there's a 90% chance that's what happened.
[00:11:45.907 --> 00:11:46.427]  Well, here it is.
[00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:49.540]  Tax protesters Ed and Elaine Brown were tricked by U.S.
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.020]  Marshals who entered their home yesterday afternoon posing as supporters.
[00:11:53.421 --> 00:12:02.783]  The Marshals entered the house at a time when there were no other supporters present and catching the Browns off guard were able to arrest them and remove them from the property.
[00:12:03.303 --> 00:12:15.446]  As we reported earlier this morning the speculation was the Browns were infiltrated and tricked before violently subdued as authorities refused to provide any details behind their arrest beside the fact that they did not peacefully surrender.
[00:12:17.754 --> 00:12:31.464]  And it still goes on, but it has now been reported by WMUR News that, here's the quotes from the federal marshals, and we'll go to Paul Watson, let's see if we can get Steve on because he saw this.
[00:12:31.964 --> 00:12:34.806]  Ultimately, and then go up to Infowars.net right now for me,
[00:12:35.914 --> 00:12:37.355]  John, go ahead and grab that newscast.
[00:12:37.815 --> 00:12:49.606]  Ultimately, the open-door policy that they seemed to have, which allowed the Browns to have some supporters bring them supplies, welcome followers, and even host a picnic, this proved to be their undoing.
[00:12:49.906 --> 00:12:51.968]  They invited us in, we escorted them out.
[00:12:53.149 --> 00:12:54.471]  That's exactly how it happened.
[00:12:55.832 --> 00:13:00.056]  A small team of marshals pulled off the ruse
[00:13:01.397 --> 00:13:06.820]  Assisting the Browns without incident on the couple's front porch, Monnier told local press.
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:13.543]  Reports are suggesting that weapons had been seized at the property, including explosive devices, booby traps, which were placed in the woods.
[00:13:13.643 --> 00:13:17.245]  Monnier added the Browns may face further charges relating to the weapons.
[00:13:17.605 --> 00:13:20.046]  Monnier also added that officials... Officials?
[00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:21.487]  Authorities?
[00:13:21.527 --> 00:13:22.888]  We're the slaves and servants.
[00:13:23.368 --> 00:13:25.550]  Paul Watson, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.450]  Do we have Paul Watson?
[00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.691]  Call him back.
[00:13:27.831 --> 00:13:28.011]  Alright.
[00:13:49.764 --> 00:14:03.567]  Guess we lost the line to England, because I know he and his brother have been working more on this in the last 45 minutes, so we will get him on to, again, give us his take on what's happening there.
[00:14:04.827 --> 00:14:09.388]  So, top story on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.net right now.
[00:14:10.168 --> 00:14:14.529]  Browns were duped by Trojan Horse Marshals posing as supporters.
[00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:16.930]  This is up right now.
[00:14:19.432 --> 00:14:22.034]  On Infowars.net.
[00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:28.879]  The problem here is that they had massive support, and everyone was against the Feds going in and murdering them, Waco style.
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:38.527]  But then when the Browns started saying, well, we're shooting into the woods and we see movement, well, what if a family was coming in to support them, or a neighbor, or somebody walking their dog?
[00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:41.989]  There's houses, you know, 100 yards away, 200 yards away.
[00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.312]  That's not proper firearm safety.
[00:14:46.417 --> 00:14:50.163]  And the police, if they were just randomly shooting into the woods, we'd call for their arrest.
[00:14:51.806 --> 00:14:53.268]  It's unsafe.
[00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.675]  And you can't do that, especially when you're inviting people onto your property.
[00:14:58.248 --> 00:15:06.371]  Now, they made the announcement that anybody coming on their property is going to be shot at before we know who you are, then it would still be very negligent.
[00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:09.232]  But, I mean, what are you supposed to say and do?
[00:15:09.533 --> 00:15:12.694]  That's when I had to say, look, I advise people not to go out there on the property.
[00:15:12.974 --> 00:15:18.536]  I've been saying that for a couple of months now, and people are like, why aren't you supporting the first and second picnics?
[00:15:19.176 --> 00:15:21.017]  I'm like, this isn't a picnic, folks.
[00:15:21.417 --> 00:15:25.719]  This is people out there with .50 caliber rifles that are saying they're going to kill anybody that comes on the property.
[00:15:27.265 --> 00:15:28.846]  Joe, it's now a war zone.
[00:15:29.186 --> 00:15:32.988]  You don't have families out there running around eating hamburgers.
[00:15:33.428 --> 00:15:36.210]  I'm not going to send people somewhere where they can get killed.
[00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.611]  I said, if men want to go out there, that's your business.
[00:15:39.131 --> 00:15:41.432]  And I said, we ought to have press conferences and get attention.
[00:15:41.472 --> 00:15:49.296]  And I commend Randy Weaver, in fact, let's try to get him to pop in today, for going up there and trying to bring attention to this so it could end peacefully.
[00:15:50.677 --> 00:15:54.439]  But the feds are in the wrong here.
[00:15:54.539 --> 00:15:55.900]  They are private mercenaries.
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:56.700]  That's the fact.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.124]  But then the Browns did a series of things, no doubt being advised by feds.
[00:16:04.746 --> 00:16:08.669]  I mean, if you go to a militia meeting, you go to any of these things, half of them are feds there.
[00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:11.151]  And you'll know who the feds are because they'll be calling for violence.
[00:16:11.511 --> 00:16:16.195]  Or trying to sell you some army surplus they got a good deal on.
[00:16:16.255 --> 00:16:17.476]  It's going to be stolen equipment.
[00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:18.717]  You're going to go to jail.
[00:16:19.197 --> 00:16:22.840]  I mean, they've got the... I see this over and over and over again.
[00:16:23.462 --> 00:16:27.925]  And I just thank God the Browns weren't killed, that no Feds were killed so they could turn them into martyrs.
[00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:30.867]  Oh, we now have Paul Watson back.
[00:16:31.248 --> 00:16:31.808]  Paul, are you there?
[00:16:33.589 --> 00:16:33.810]  Yes.
[00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:37.172]  You've been able to see the newscast, read more of the reports that just now came out.
[00:16:37.212 --> 00:16:39.474]  It's up on prisonplanet.com right now.
[00:16:39.534 --> 00:16:41.555]  Anything I didn't cover that you've discovered?
[00:16:43.216 --> 00:16:44.817]  I haven't seen the newscast, Alex.
[00:16:44.877 --> 00:16:48.520]  They were going to have it streamed live on WMUR.
[00:16:50.245 --> 00:17:08.782]  New Hampshire 9 TV station website but then they changed the location so it wasn't streamed live but they're saying it's going to be up on their website soon so I haven't seen it but what we do... We just now got it so we'll IM it to you so you can post it in your brother's report on InfoWars.net but go ahead.
[00:17:09.482 --> 00:17:16.669]  Yeah we just got all the press reports that came out about an hour and a half ago.
[00:17:17.659 --> 00:17:21.802]  So I was up on the prison planet about, you know, an hour ago.
[00:17:22.062 --> 00:17:31.469]  So, yeah, basically they, they, uh, as we predicted earlier, because obviously I woke up and learned that they'd been arrested.
[00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:41.177]  So a lot of times the best information that you can get when nothing's being reported on something is by going to the message board.
[00:17:41.257 --> 00:17:45.380]  So I went to the prison planet message board and people were speculating that
[00:17:46.648 --> 00:17:57.420]  You know, because Ed Brown had said he would fight to the death rather than surrender, how was it possible for the Marshals to go in and peacefully, as we're told, arrest them?
[00:17:58.241 --> 00:18:07.851]  So, obviously, the logical conclusion was that they posed as supporters and just went in there as a Trojan horse, and it turns out that that's exactly what happened.
[00:18:09.295 --> 00:18:10.536]  Well, I mean, that was obvious.
[00:18:10.676 --> 00:18:18.680]  If the Feds wanted to get the Browns, when they had those 300 people on their property, I'll bet bottom dollar there were 20 marshals and FBI there then.
[00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:29.726]  And they've had FBI coming in in overalls, posing as hillbillies, and then openly saying, I'm FBI, you, you, you, you, you, Constitution Rangers are wimps.
[00:18:30.763 --> 00:18:32.804]  I mean, it's just total fed up.
[00:18:33.485 --> 00:18:38.927]  And a lot of the people getting them rounds to shoot their mouths off about violence no doubt were feds, and we've tracked that back.
[00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:46.091]  And I'm just so tired of watching patriots fall into traps, but I'm just glad that they weren't able to go in there and murder all of them.
[00:18:49.249 --> 00:19:01.775]  Yeah, I thought the Feds wanted to have this quiet down and try to end this peacefully until they flew the helicopter low for eight hours at 30 feet before they shot people with tasers, shot at Danny Reilly.
[00:19:02.855 --> 00:19:05.816]  And then now this seems like a de-escalation that they didn't cap them.
[00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:11.159]  And I think that's because the Marshals are genuinely worried about people coming after them.
[00:19:11.439 --> 00:19:17.421]  And that is the safer move and the right move to not bust a cap in both of them, as we know the Feds are apt to do.
[00:19:17.681 --> 00:19:18.722]  Anything else, Paul Watson?
[00:19:20.178 --> 00:19:29.825]  Uh, just that people are still asking questions which haven't been answered about, you know, if they were violently subdued because the U.S.
[00:19:29.905 --> 00:19:36.730]  Marshal Monnier admitted that they had not surrendered, which suggests that they at least put up some resistance.
[00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:40.873]  So people are asking questions about how they were subdued before their actual arrest.
[00:19:41.393 --> 00:19:42.654]  But we don't know what happened yet.
[00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:45.676]  I can tell you what happened.
[00:19:45.696 --> 00:19:49.419]  You got about five people around the Browns, all of a sudden they pull guns out and
[00:19:50.387 --> 00:19:51.468]  Sharpest are whipping him.
[00:19:52.989 --> 00:19:54.550]  Alright, Paul stay there.
[00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.571]  I've got one or two other questions for you on the other side.
[00:19:57.131 --> 00:19:59.313]  We'll be right back, right here on the Houston Radio Network.
[00:20:03.356 --> 00:20:07.859]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:08.199 --> 00:20:12.281]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:12.582 --> 00:20:13.122]  We listened.
[00:20:13.442 --> 00:20:18.425]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:18.706 --> 00:20:19.166]  We listened.
[00:20:19.546 --> 00:20:22.588]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:23.008 --> 00:20:23.549]  We listened.
[00:20:24.009 --> 00:20:28.071]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:20:28.472 --> 00:20:28.952]  We listened.
[00:20:29.292 --> 00:20:34.535]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:20:34.955 --> 00:20:36.316]  Again, we listened.
[00:20:36.656 --> 00:20:38.237]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:20:38.438 --> 00:20:43.981]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:20:44.441 --> 00:20:47.083]  Get the Berkey Lite at the American Water Purifier.
[00:20:47.283 --> 00:20:47.484]  Only $279.
[00:20:47.544 --> 00:20:48.124]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:48.424]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:20:48.464 --> 00:20:50.066]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:20:50.106 --> 00:20:51.066]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:00.478 --> 00:21:01.458]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:01.538 --> 00:21:06.319]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:06.479 --> 00:21:14.301]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:14.561 --> 00:21:19.922]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:20.122 --> 00:21:27.104]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:27.404 --> 00:21:32.750]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:21:33.011 --> 00:21:37.736]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[00:21:38.076 --> 00:21:45.665]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:21:46.005 --> 00:21:52.252]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:52.572 --> 00:21:53.774]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.794 --> 00:21:54.034]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.914 --> 00:22:02.995]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:03.616 --> 00:22:12.542]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:12.982 --> 00:22:20.187]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:20.899 --> 00:22:26.404]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:22:26.884 --> 00:22:37.713]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:22:38.474 --> 00:22:40.496]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:22:41.036 --> 00:22:43.818]  For more information call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:22:43.858 --> 00:22:44.198]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:01.992]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:02.132 --> 00:23:07.317]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:23:07.498 --> 00:23:08.839]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:23:09.099 --> 00:23:17.267]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:17.507 --> 00:23:23.233]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:23.393 --> 00:23:25.174]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:23:25.235 --> 00:23:27.396]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:23:27.536 --> 00:23:31.780]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.102]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:23:34.182 --> 00:23:41.948]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:23:42.008 --> 00:23:42.849]  We're good to go.
[00:24:04.023 --> 00:24:10.050]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:13.673]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:18.879 --> 00:24:20.580]  We've got some of the press conference.
[00:24:21.221 --> 00:24:23.423]  It's been posted up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:24:27.463 --> 00:24:37.349]  The Chicago Tribune, the Boston Globe have all reported that documents have come out that indeed Israel attacked the USS Liberty knowing it was a U.S.
[00:24:37.409 --> 00:24:37.649]  ship.
[00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:43.192]  And we've got one of the people that's most angry about this coming on in the next segment.
[00:24:43.792 --> 00:24:46.233]  Then Ron Paul, then Dave Mustaine of Megadeth.
[00:24:46.674 --> 00:24:48.855]  Yes, it's a big show lined up for you today.
[00:24:50.816 --> 00:24:52.397]  But going back to Paul Watson,
[00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:57.030]  As bad as this is, Paul, this is better than a shootout.
[00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.750]  It's better than federal martyrs.
[00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:01.450]  It's better than the Browns being martyrs.
[00:25:02.511 --> 00:25:10.272]  Now we've got to make sure they don't get railroaded too badly, but they're in the clutches of the authorities, the officials, the gods.
[00:25:10.712 --> 00:25:12.092]  What do you think of this whole saga?
[00:25:14.033 --> 00:25:19.854]  Well, I mean, they live to fight another day, but, you know, it's 63 months in prison.
[00:25:20.234 --> 00:25:21.094]  No doubt they're going to
[00:25:22.259 --> 00:25:34.669]  Keep on a bunch of other charges, because now they're already, the Monier was out saying that they'd found explosives and high-caliber weapons and that the whole property was booby-trapped.
[00:25:35.309 --> 00:25:45.597]  So no doubt that 63-month prison sentence is just, you know, just for starters, but obviously it's a relief that it didn't end in bloodshed.
[00:25:47.336 --> 00:25:52.438]  Maybe it's a portent for how they'll treat similar cases in the future.
[00:25:53.098 --> 00:26:02.062]  And if there are more Ed and Elaine Browns out there, you know, if there are so many, then it gets to a point where they can't keep track of everyone.
[00:26:02.122 --> 00:26:06.564]  So their example stands out as a shining light to everyone.
[00:26:06.604 --> 00:26:13.286]  And the courage that they displayed throughout the whole standoff was admirable.
[00:26:14.607 --> 00:26:16.568]  Their courage is admirable.
[00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:21.552]  But I wish they wouldn't have let themselves be set up.
[00:26:22.933 --> 00:26:28.257]  Because there's no doubt that the feds were in there trying to provocateur and get them to shoot their mouths off.
[00:26:29.018 --> 00:26:31.120]  And there's no doubt now that they fell into that trap.
[00:26:32.321 --> 00:26:36.444]  Because if they would have been peaceful in their statements all along, there wouldn't be all these added
[00:26:37.785 --> 00:26:38.145]  I think so.
[00:26:59.165 --> 00:27:08.049]  When Brown and others were openly shooting their mouths off about this, let me tell you, it was not helpful for those of us that were trying to de-escalate the situation.
[00:27:09.109 --> 00:27:26.057]  Well, no, and the Fed seized on that for intimidation purposes after they started arresting the Browns' supporters because of this violent rhetoric, so yeah, they could have played it differently in that sense, and obviously the dwindling amount of supporters
[00:27:26.866 --> 00:27:30.849]  Well, they wouldn't even let the media in anymore, and that's just plain stupid.
[00:27:30.869 --> 00:27:33.531]  You always want to get people to keep talking.
[00:27:33.611 --> 00:27:38.615]  Well, yeah, but I mean, if you've obviously got to look at it from their perspective, if you've been
[00:27:55.077 --> 00:28:22.656]  hold up there in their home for that amount of time with all the threats flying around then you're going to get paranoid but and that's going to you know affect your thinking and affect your strategy so I just look at them as being incredibly courageous but relieved in a sense that it didn't end in a in a Waco 2 but now they live to fight another day after they eventually get out of prison
[00:28:25.546 --> 00:28:27.567]  Well, I think they're going to be in prison a long time.
[00:28:27.607 --> 00:28:34.211]  We need to make sure that they get support in a proper defense.
[00:28:35.212 --> 00:28:45.378]  I mean, they're going to try to put all sorts of sentences on them now because of statements that were made and things that were done.
[00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:52.502]  But I'll be interested to find out who was posing as patriots all along and was really FBI and federal marshals.
[00:28:53.234 --> 00:29:00.817]  In all these newscasts and clips, I'm trying to read through them, Paul, do we know how many people first subdued them before all the hundreds of police came on the scene?
[00:29:02.137 --> 00:29:08.259]  All it says is a small team of marshals, so I'm guessing, you know, three, four, five.
[00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:20.403]  Because if they get a big group of guys walking up to the house, obviously they're going to get suspicious, so I don't think it would have been any more than four or five individuals, maximum.
[00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:26.850]  Well, I tell you, a lot of bravery on both sides.
[00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:38.033]  Because usually the feds would just burn the building down in the past, like they tried at Ruby Ridge, like they did at Waco, because they're too scared to actually get up close to their quarry.
[00:29:38.953 --> 00:29:47.096]  So while I despise the feds for their criminal actions, I am at least glad they didn't kill them, and I'm glad they didn't burn the place down.
[00:29:47.116 --> 00:29:48.616]  They'd be true cowards.
[00:29:51.639 --> 00:29:54.627]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.569 --> 00:29:58.276]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.654 --> 00:30:14.104]  A new cancer study conducted on 500 mice shows when they consumed MRET-activated water that it was nearly equal in effectiveness to chemotherapy, yet without toxic side effects.
[00:30:14.365 --> 00:30:27.396]  Another study done on mice intentionally infected with staphylococcal bacteria showed that 30% of those who drank regular water died from the infection, while 100% of the mice that drank MRET-activated water lived.
[00:30:27.637 --> 00:30:28.778]  The secret of MRET.
[00:30:29.138 --> 00:30:29.819]  We're good to go.
[00:30:46.278 --> 00:30:46.578]  We're good.
[00:31:01.644 --> 00:31:04.567]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:31:04.727 --> 00:31:09.912]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:31:10.252 --> 00:31:15.557]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:31:15.977 --> 00:31:17.098]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:17.459 --> 00:31:26.427]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:31:26.687 --> 00:31:26.747]  Yes!

[00:32:08.122 --> 00:32:08.383]  Hemp.
[00:32:08.803 --> 00:32:11.544]  Used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[00:32:11.904 --> 00:32:12.204]  Hemp.
[00:32:12.544 --> 00:32:19.006]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[00:32:19.347 --> 00:32:22.608]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.

[00:33:01.733 --> 00:33:03.874]  Big John.
[00:33:04.614 --> 00:33:07.816]  Big John.
[00:33:07.836 --> 00:33:10.396]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[00:33:10.436 --> 00:33:12.757]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[00:33:12.817 --> 00:33:15.778]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[00:33:15.838 --> 00:33:19.420]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lip to Big John.
[00:33:21.227 --> 00:33:44.526]  Big John, Big John, Big Bad John, Big John Nobody seemed to know where John called home He just drifted into town and stayed all alone Didn't seem like he was kinda quiet and shy But he didn't spoke at all, he just said hi, Big John
[00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:58.546]  Somebody said he came from New Orleans, where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen and a crashing blow from a huge right-hand San Luciano fella to the promised land, Big John.
[00:33:58.626 --> 00:34:00.309]  Welcome back, thank you for joining us today.
[00:34:00.349 --> 00:34:01.350]  Big John!
[00:34:07.636 --> 00:34:10.479]  New revelations and attack on American spy ship.
[00:34:10.559 --> 00:34:12.561]  Veterans documents suggest U.S.
[00:34:12.681 --> 00:34:17.385]  Israel didn't tell the full story of the deadly 1967 incident.
[00:34:18.166 --> 00:34:22.350]  That is out of the Boston Baltimore Sun.
[00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:24.932]  That is also a Boston Globe story here.
[00:34:25.293 --> 00:34:27.635]  Another one out of the Chicago Tribune.
[00:34:29.039 --> 00:34:31.360]  New revelations of an attack on an American spy ship.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.640]  Veterans documents suggest U.S.
[00:34:33.741 --> 00:34:37.462]  Israel didn't tell the full story of the deadly 1967 incident.
[00:34:39.942 --> 00:34:53.247]  And it continues that Bryce Lockwood, Marine Staff Sergeant, Russian language expert, recipient of the Silver Star for heroism, ordained Baptist minister, is shouting into the phone, I'm angry!
[00:34:53.607 --> 00:34:54.667]  I'm seething with anger.
[00:34:54.727 --> 00:34:57.548]  Forty years and I'm still seething with anger.
[00:34:58.283 --> 00:35:01.084]  Lockwood was aboard the USS Liberty, the most highly decorated U.S.
[00:35:01.124 --> 00:35:01.805]  ship in U.S.
[00:35:01.825 --> 00:35:20.494]  history, I would add, a super-secret spy ship on station in the eastern Mediterranean when four Israeli fighter jets flew out of the afternoon sun to strafe bomb and then the virtually defenseless vessel on June 8, 1967, the fourth day of what would become known as the Six-Day War.
[00:35:21.164 --> 00:35:30.031]  Yeah, they attacked with Mirage, they attacked with Daesan missile re-bombers, they attacked with patrol boats, they attacked and attacked and attacked and attacked for hour after hour.
[00:35:31.291 --> 00:35:34.414]  And now there have been some big new developments.
[00:35:35.154 --> 00:35:41.359]  Now we've interviewed admirals involved, and we've interviewed the judge advocate generals involved, and those who were told to whitewash the whole thing.
[00:35:41.379 --> 00:35:44.121]  We've interviewed so many people, many of them have died now.
[00:35:44.773 --> 00:35:50.539]  The captain of the ship, and we've interviewed Admiral Thomas More, later to become Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:35:51.039 --> 00:35:53.161]  We've interviewed so many.
[00:35:54.002 --> 00:35:57.045]  Really, I've been interviewing people for 10 years, but this has been going on for 40.
[00:35:57.705 --> 00:36:06.574]  And joining us is that individual who was in the Chicago Tribune and other papers around the country, and who was on that ship 40 years ago.
[00:36:07.657 --> 00:36:08.637]  Bryce Lockwood.
[00:36:09.017 --> 00:36:17.999]  Sir, I appreciate your service to this country, and I appreciate your continuing to honor those that died that day and those that were wounded that day by speaking out.
[00:36:18.559 --> 00:36:19.199]  Thank you, sir.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:34.182]  Instead of me getting into these new revelations, if you could, just set the table for those that don't know what happened with the Liberty in a few minutes, and then walk through the denials, the attacks on the heroes, those that have spoken out, and then what this new info means.
[00:36:35.114 --> 00:36:48.717]  Well, basically, the new info is transcripts of voice intercept tapes that were taken by both a Navy airborne collection platform and an Air Force airborne collection platform.
[00:36:49.917 --> 00:36:59.179]  National Security Agency had denied for years that they had the tapes, and yet here they turned up under a Freedom of Information Act after 40 years has expired.
[00:37:00.579 --> 00:37:01.379]  They're pretty damning.
[00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:06.114]  The Israelis clearly identify the ship as American and attacked it anyway.
[00:37:08.096 --> 00:37:12.018]  And this is outside Israeli waters, in international waters, in the Mediterranean?
[00:37:12.759 --> 00:37:18.203]  We were about 13.7 miles off the Sinai coast when we were attacked.
[00:37:19.544 --> 00:37:29.131]  There are some of us now that think the primary reason for Israel attacking us, they had captured an entire Egyptian brigade, somewhere in excess of 850 men.
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.920]  Forced them to dig their own graves.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:40.963]  Many of them had their hands bound behind them after they dug their graves and were massacred by the Israelis on June 8, 1967.
[00:37:41.863 --> 00:37:43.923]  With Ariel Sharon overseeing the operation.
[00:37:44.824 --> 00:37:45.884]  I understand that, yes.
[00:37:46.784 --> 00:37:48.545]  And here comes the US spy ship.
[00:37:49.125 --> 00:37:50.025]  Now we've got a problem.
[00:37:51.596 --> 00:37:56.018]  Now, that's the report I always got from the admirals and the captain and people ten years ago.
[00:37:56.039 --> 00:38:06.224]  Over time, though, most of the heroes of the Liberty also believe that there was a plan to then go ahead and blame it on Egypt and then escalate the war.
[00:38:07.045 --> 00:38:08.345]  That is quite likely.
[00:38:10.186 --> 00:38:11.587]  We don't know all the details.
[00:38:12.287 --> 00:38:19.251]  There is a... Operation Cyanide messages were passed between Washington, D.C.
[00:38:19.271 --> 00:38:20.452]  and the captain of the ship.
[00:38:22.024 --> 00:38:22.964]  Captain McGonigal.
[00:38:23.625 --> 00:38:25.967]  They were labeled Captain's Eyes Only.
[00:38:27.528 --> 00:38:34.594]  Just the very label, Operation Cyanide, sends a chill through your veins.
[00:38:36.455 --> 00:38:37.957]  We don't know what that was all about.
[00:38:38.037 --> 00:38:39.458]  There's been some speculation.
[00:38:40.599 --> 00:38:45.523]  There was a Scottish reporter that wrote a book on Operation Cyanide on a Liberty attack.
[00:38:46.164 --> 00:38:47.705]  And that was pretty much his premise.
[00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:54.110]  By the way, a people who knew what cyanide was will start talking about it and then die within hours of heart attacks.
[00:38:57.272 --> 00:38:58.573]  That's a possibility, I'd say.
[00:38:59.494 --> 00:39:00.175]  Well, we've seen that.
[00:39:00.215 --> 00:39:02.316]  Every time it comes up, it's a very dangerous subject.
[00:39:02.837 --> 00:39:05.418]  And I know that McGonigal wouldn't talk very much about that.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:15.346]  Captain McGonigal, I firmly believe he very much deserved the Medal of Honor for his entire conduct
[00:39:16.535 --> 00:39:21.157]  Throughout the attack and until Admiral Kidd came aboard.
[00:39:22.138 --> 00:39:28.981]  From the time that Admiral Kidd joined the ship before she even reached Malta, a lid was clamped on everything.
[00:39:29.001 --> 00:39:30.601]  We were ordered not to talk about it.
[00:39:32.282 --> 00:39:36.224]  Captain McGonigal was in his last cruise.
[00:39:36.744 --> 00:39:41.326]  He was going to be forced to retire after this cruise where Liberty was attacked.
[00:39:42.246 --> 00:39:43.927]  Suddenly he's awarded the
[00:39:44.778 --> 00:39:45.959]  Congressional Medal of Honor.
[00:39:46.479 --> 00:39:50.282]  He's promoted to full captain and given his choice of duty.
[00:39:51.023 --> 00:39:56.527]  And it sure sounds to me and many of the other crewmen that the captain was paid off to keep quiet.
[00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:57.948]  Absolutely.
[00:39:58.088 --> 00:40:03.493]  Now walk through specifically, and again we're talking to USS Liberty hero and survivor Bryce Lockwood.
[00:40:04.033 --> 00:40:06.415]  Bryce is a young Marine officer on that ship.
[00:40:07.055 --> 00:40:07.776]  What were you doing?
[00:40:09.077 --> 00:40:11.118]  I was a Russian linguist until I was enlisted.
[00:40:11.259 --> 00:40:13.080]  I was not an officer.
[00:40:13.638 --> 00:40:17.961]  But I was a Russian linguist, and that was my primary responsibility.
[00:40:18.381 --> 00:40:23.204]  There was a group of Soviet Tu-95s stationed at Alexandria, Egypt.
[00:40:24.125 --> 00:40:29.489]  And the Soviets had pretty well told the world that they were manned by United Arab Republic crews.
[00:40:29.569 --> 00:40:29.989]  They weren't.
[00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:36.013]  They were manned by Soviets in United Arab Republic uniforms.
[00:40:37.034 --> 00:40:40.216]  And our job was to locate
[00:40:40.876 --> 00:40:46.499]  By radio, those Soviet aircraft, and to get the goods on them if we could.
[00:40:47.339 --> 00:40:55.122]  Incidentally, just seconds before the torpedo struck, my watch relief was a gentleman by the name of Jim Lupton.
[00:40:55.923 --> 00:41:01.205]  Jim comes excitedly into the processing and reporting area, and he says, Hey Sarge, I got him, I got him!
[00:41:01.225 --> 00:41:02.385]  I said, Got who, Jim?
[00:41:02.466 --> 00:41:03.666]  He said, I got the Ruskies!
[00:41:03.686 --> 00:41:04.747]  I said, You're kidding!
[00:41:04.767 --> 00:41:06.687]  He said, No man, I got them, plain language!
[00:41:07.448 --> 00:41:07.888]  And within
[00:41:08.658 --> 00:41:11.399]  Just a matter of seconds the torpedo struck and killed him.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.421]  So you guys didn't know you'd already been approached by torpedo boats.
[00:41:16.481 --> 00:41:20.143]  The captain saw their attack angle and was already trying to take evasive action.
[00:41:20.423 --> 00:41:22.824]  If he wouldn't have, no doubt, you would have been completely destroyed.
[00:41:23.184 --> 00:41:29.327]  Can you describe, because the media always waters it down and says a few planes dropped a few bombs lovingly on you.
[00:41:29.527 --> 00:41:32.008]  Can you walk through why it's the most decorated ship in U.S.
[00:41:32.028 --> 00:41:32.308]  history?
[00:41:34.289 --> 00:41:35.690]  Well, a few bombs.
[00:41:36.593 --> 00:41:41.636]  There were 840 large caliber strikes on the ship.
[00:41:42.596 --> 00:41:49.620]  A couple of those were napalm that destroyed all of our life rafts.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.942]  There was nothing left of the life rafts but shreds from the napalm.
[00:41:55.323 --> 00:41:59.545]  The torpedo boats, there were over 3,100 large caliber machine gun strikes.
[00:41:59.565 --> 00:42:02.887]  50 caliber machine gun strikes
[00:42:05.235 --> 00:42:14.881]  Actually, I think they say they're a 30mm cannon, but it's about equivalent to the American .50 caliber machine gun bullet.
[00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:16.782]  She was riddled!
[00:42:17.783 --> 00:42:25.207]  And for the Israelis to say it was a case of mistaken identity just flies in the face of anyone that's ever been at sea.
[00:42:27.283 --> 00:42:29.785]  We had home markings on there, GTR5.
[00:42:30.225 --> 00:42:37.389]  Before you fire the ship at sea, you look up on Jane's Fighting Ships and find out the target that you're firing on.
[00:42:38.609 --> 00:42:46.033]  It would be just like walking downtown with a pistol in your hand and finding a cop and throwing his head away and then claim, well, I thought he was robbing a bank.
[00:42:46.093 --> 00:42:49.075]  That's about the equivalent of what the Israelis were doing to us.
[00:42:49.873 --> 00:43:02.964]  Go to James Fighting Ships, look that number up, GTR-5, it will say in there, Auxiliary, which means she's a non-combatant, General Technical Research, in the fifth ship of her class, the newest and most modern of her class.
[00:43:02.984 --> 00:43:14.694]  Well, what, five, six years ago, an Israeli pilot came out and admitted that three times he refused to fire, and they said go ahead and do it, so that was, you know, open and shut there, but now we have these communiques released.
[00:43:15.514 --> 00:43:15.734]  Yes.
[00:43:17.196 --> 00:43:18.657]  Or they come right out and identify it.
[00:43:20.894 --> 00:43:21.714]  As an American ship.
[00:43:22.614 --> 00:43:23.635]  Flying an American flag.
[00:43:26.415 --> 00:43:34.137]  And talking to the others, but this is for memory, I want to make sure I'm correct, because it was a war zone, wasn't the ship flying an unusually large flag?
[00:43:37.978 --> 00:43:42.259]  The flag that was flying in the initial air attack was knocked down.
[00:43:43.339 --> 00:43:48.101]  Then the holiday flag was run up, which is the largest flag you have aboard ship.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:56.081]  I'm not exactly sure of the size, but I think it's something like 20 feet by 30 feet or 16 by 30 feet, something of that nature.
[00:43:56.621 --> 00:43:57.201]  Gigantic.
[00:43:57.661 --> 00:43:57.981]  Huge.
[00:43:59.182 --> 00:43:59.442]  Yes.
[00:44:01.102 --> 00:44:02.702]  And what did they do to the holiday flag?
[00:44:03.882 --> 00:44:05.803]  Oh, riddled it with shellfire.
[00:44:08.423 --> 00:44:09.483]  Riddled it with shellfire.
[00:44:12.404 --> 00:44:18.625]  There's been all these defenders and debunkers who've tried to write books and tell lies and say horrible things about the vets.
[00:44:19.891 --> 00:44:23.574]  And the Heroes of Liberty, boy, they really are eating crow right now!
[00:44:24.734 --> 00:44:25.635]  Well, I hope they are.
[00:44:26.435 --> 00:44:35.481]  But I'm sure there's still... The one in particular, Jay Kristol, incidentally, he's an admiral in the United States Navy Reserves.
[00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:36.882]  He's probably retired by now.
[00:44:37.443 --> 00:44:44.767]  He's the one that wrote the thesis for a doctorate from the University of Miami, and that never should have been granted because
[00:44:46.745 --> 00:44:56.087]  I understand that he was there for economics, and yet he wrote this thesis on the liberty of how it was an accident, quote-unquote, and got his doctorate.
[00:44:56.467 --> 00:44:57.668]  That should have been withdrawn.
[00:44:58.748 --> 00:45:01.689]  Now, how many hours did this now confirm deliberate attack?
[00:45:01.709 --> 00:45:03.129]  This is huge news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:03.409 --> 00:45:05.569]  How long did they accidentally bomb the ship?
[00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:07.650]  Somewhere around two hours.
[00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:11.567]  Some say more than that, some say a little less than that.
[00:45:11.687 --> 00:45:18.809]  I think, actually, from the time that the first shot was fired until the last shot was fired, was very close to two hours.
[00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:28.812]  You know, sometimes when we have a news story this big on air, I don't have words to describe just how important it is.
[00:45:29.192 --> 00:45:31.373]  This has been a 40-year fight for justice.
[00:45:32.633 --> 00:45:36.014]  Here it is, out in the open, NSA aircraft intercepts.
[00:45:37.754 --> 00:45:50.124]  Can you specifically go through more of, and you know, plus you were trained in intercepting different intercepts, so you're specifically the perfect guest for this, not just one of the heroes and victims of this, but also you're an expert in intercepts.
[00:45:50.584 --> 00:45:53.687]  Can you speak to us how these are intercepted, why they're so important?
[00:45:57.349 --> 00:46:05.536]  Well, the Israelis had a nuclear weapon, and I suppose were threatening to use it.
[00:46:06.813 --> 00:46:17.159]  And the Soviets had, excuse me, an ICBM submarine off Israel loaded with nuclear weapons.
[00:46:18.519 --> 00:46:20.280]  There's a book out about that.
[00:46:21.621 --> 00:46:27.084]  I think the number of the submarine was SB-151, but I may be wrong on that.
[00:46:27.124 --> 00:46:28.705]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:46:29.105 --> 00:46:34.488]  But the captain of that submarine was ordered, if Israel uses the nuclear weapons, incinerate it.
[00:46:37.489 --> 00:46:43.331]  So here is the makings of World War III right on the doorstep.
[00:46:44.632 --> 00:46:52.574]  And for anyone with a lick of common sense to think that we're not going to make sure we've got all the bases covered is rather presumptuous.
[00:46:53.435 --> 00:47:05.639]  We had Air Force reconnaissance planes, we had Navy reconnaissance planes, we had the USS Liberty making sure that all the bases were covered, that if any information was out there of impending hostilities it would
[00:47:06.204 --> 00:47:07.284]  Border on World War 3.
[00:47:07.424 --> 00:47:08.905]  We need to know about it.
[00:47:10.525 --> 00:47:11.805]  Because it's World War 3!
[00:47:11.845 --> 00:47:12.745]  You'd want to know about that.
[00:47:13.326 --> 00:47:15.926]  You're... Well, I started using X-Men.
[00:47:17.867 --> 00:47:22.408]  So, all this is being recorded, probably more tapes than just these aircraft, obviously.
[00:47:23.108 --> 00:47:27.149]  You've got the big hot zone in the world at that time, a major war going.
[00:47:27.469 --> 00:47:32.610]  Now, what about hours later when the Israeli commando helicopters show up with commandos on board
[00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:45.315]  In their assault gear, a lot of the other heroes of the Liberty and officers believe that it was the Russian spy ship observing this that did finally cause the Israelis to abort because they knew the Russians would report that.
[00:47:45.815 --> 00:47:52.977]  There was a Russian destroyer that had been shadowing us our entire trip from the time we left the road to Spain until we were on station.
[00:47:52.997 --> 00:47:55.278]  There was a Soviet destroyer that was shadowing us.
[00:47:55.919 --> 00:47:59.740]  And it's quite obvious that they were keeping an eye on things and listening in also.
[00:48:00.365 --> 00:48:06.447]  As a matter of fact, they were one of the first ones to offer us aid, which the captain refused.
[00:48:08.908 --> 00:48:10.548]  I heard the helicopters come over.
[00:48:10.648 --> 00:48:17.510]  I did not actually see them myself, but I heard the helicopters coming over, and I was lying on the deck in the radio room.
[00:48:18.891 --> 00:48:21.752]  Every transmitting antenna we had had been destroyed.
[00:48:22.572 --> 00:48:26.493]  A couple of Commander Lewis's, he was the operations officer, Commander Lewis,
[00:48:27.094 --> 00:48:29.296]  A couple of his men went up topside.
[00:48:29.356 --> 00:48:30.998]  Terry Halbardi was one of them.
[00:48:31.018 --> 00:48:32.959]  I forget who the other is off the top of my head right now.
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:39.145]  And strung a long wire while these torpedo boats are riddling the ship with machine gun fire.
[00:48:39.165 --> 00:48:41.447]  If that's not bravery, I don't know what is.
[00:48:42.528 --> 00:48:45.230]  Came back down in the radio room and got a mayday off.
[00:48:45.894 --> 00:48:47.134]  And I was there listening to it.
[00:48:47.254 --> 00:48:47.835]  Firefox!
[00:48:47.915 --> 00:48:48.475]  Firefox!
[00:48:48.515 --> 00:48:49.535]  This is Rockstar!
[00:48:49.595 --> 00:48:53.397]  Rockstar under attack by unidentified surface and naval air units.
[00:48:53.457 --> 00:48:54.697]  Require immediate assistance.
[00:48:55.217 --> 00:49:00.719]  And as soon as the carrier Saratoga acknowledged it and said help is on the way, the shooting stopped.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.120]  I say it stopped.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:10.002]  I saw three sailors carrying the old World War II cork life rafts.
[00:49:10.062 --> 00:49:12.343]  We had three of those inside the ship.
[00:49:13.103 --> 00:49:18.705]  They were taking those to put over the side and get the most seriously wounded off onto them.
[00:49:20.086 --> 00:49:26.328]  I saw them go through the radio room, over to the port side of the ship.
[00:49:28.208 --> 00:49:29.749]  I heard an engine rev up.
[00:49:30.865 --> 00:49:39.370]  And more machine gun fire, and I found out later that the Israeli torpedo boats had riddled those life rafts and carried off what was left of them.
[00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:47.775]  Now see, I've been told that by the admirals, by the first mates, by the doctor, and then I get attacked by the news media saying I just made that up.
[00:49:49.496 --> 00:49:52.798]  That they didn't shoot up the life rafts.
[00:49:54.258 --> 00:49:55.259]  Well, I heard the shooting.
[00:49:55.339 --> 00:49:57.600]  I didn't actually witness it first hand.
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:03.123]  But I've interviewed the people that did, and they're on record too, and the media just lies and lies and says we're liars.
[00:50:04.584 --> 00:50:05.484]  You gotta protect Israel.
[00:50:08.286 --> 00:50:09.126]  This is incredible.
[00:50:09.226 --> 00:50:15.250]  What are they going to do that now all these NSA intercepts have been released that the Israelis were identifying it as a U.S.
[00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:15.890]  ship anew?
[00:50:17.571 --> 00:50:21.313]  I'm pissed about their attack on Lebanon last year.
[00:50:21.473 --> 00:50:22.474]  There was no call for that.
[00:50:24.853 --> 00:50:30.277]  Literally thousands of Lebanese were killed and the entire country of Lebanon destroyed by the Israelis.
[00:50:30.817 --> 00:50:33.178]  Because two Israeli soldiers were captured?
[00:50:34.259 --> 00:50:35.240]  Give me a break!
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:38.822]  It's unbelievable.
[00:50:38.842 --> 00:50:39.402]  Stay there, sir.
[00:50:39.442 --> 00:50:39.943]  We've got a break.
[00:50:39.963 --> 00:50:41.684]  We're going to come right back to you after a couple of minutes.
[00:50:41.744 --> 00:50:54.132]  Bruce Lockwood, he was in the Marines on that ship, in the spy box, down in the ship, seeing all this unfold 40 years ago, and now the truth's come out.
[00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:57.991]  We'll be right back when the truth is exactly what these heroes said it was.
[00:50:58.011 --> 00:51:05.074]  It's here.
[00:51:05.275 --> 00:51:10.057]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.437 --> 00:51:18.060]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:25.823]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.203 --> 00:51:37.608]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.948 --> 00:51:41.490]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:44.131]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.171 --> 00:51:48.013]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.667 --> 00:52:04.829]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:04.869 --> 00:52:08.892]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:09.032 --> 00:52:11.594]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:11.654 --> 00:52:13.996]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:14.176 --> 00:52:22.622]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:22.702 --> 00:52:24.003]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[00:52:24.143 --> 00:52:28.166]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:28.166 --> 00:52:28.646]  We're good to go!

[00:53:01.129 --> 00:53:09.194]  Hi, this is Jeff Rentz, and if you're interested in suppressed natural cures and rare exotic remedies, this may be the most important message you'll hear for a long time.
[00:53:09.674 --> 00:53:18.959]  There's an opportunity right now for a limited number of listeners to acquire an amazing, blacklisted, naturally occurring compound with very unusual ionic properties.
[00:53:19.439 --> 00:53:23.742]  In fact, it's considered the single most important remedy in all of Ayurvedic medicine.
[00:53:24.344 --> 00:53:36.411]  Medical studies have been conducted abroad on the effects this rare mineral-like compound has on energy, diabetes, tumors, ulcers, memory, and brain function, not to mention reproductive health, exercise recovery, and arthritis.
[00:53:36.932 --> 00:53:41.855]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made.
[00:53:42.335 --> 00:53:45.717]  However, it's still quite legal to own this compound, and the best part?
[00:53:46.177 --> 00:53:47.658]  My listeners pay nothing down.
[00:53:47.738 --> 00:53:49.439]  Simply go to blacklistedherb.com.
[00:53:49.579 --> 00:53:52.101]  That's blacklistedherb.com.
[00:53:52.601 --> 00:53:52.921]  Or call 815-259-4552.
[00:53:52.941 --> 00:53:53.621]  That's 815-259-4552 for details.
[00:53:53.681 --> 00:53:54.462]  Boom, boom, bop-a-boom.
[00:53:54.502 --> 00:53:55.402]  Boom, boom, bop-a-boom.
[00:53:55.422 --> 00:53:55.622]  Boom, boom.
[00:54:19.173 --> 00:54:28.036]  Bryce Lockwood, Marine Staff Sergeant, Russian Language Expert, recipient of the Silver Star for Heroism, Ordained Baptist Minister, is our guest.
[00:54:28.076 --> 00:54:29.516]  He was on the Liberty 40 years ago.
[00:54:30.216 --> 00:54:47.641]  I've got the Chicago Tribune here in front of me, and it's got the Chicago Tribune, one of their experts, who, you know, deciphers Israeli, who's Israeli himself, reading it, and he's just going over, listening to the tapes.
[00:54:48.747 --> 00:54:53.334]  And it says it's an American ship, just as the pilot years ago had said.
[00:54:54.335 --> 00:54:56.078]  And they're told, but it's Americans.
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:59.983]  And they're told, no, go ahead and attack it.
[00:55:00.263 --> 00:55:05.571]  And we're going to read part of this transcript coming up in the next hour.
[00:55:07.378 --> 00:55:17.605]  Now, if it can be shown that American naval officers and politicians knew about all this beforehand, which we know in Executive Session they did, I think there needs to be criminal charges against them.
[00:55:17.885 --> 00:55:20.127]  I mean, this is covering up war crimes.
[00:55:20.167 --> 00:55:22.388]  This is becoming accessories after the fact.
[00:55:22.428 --> 00:55:22.969]  Is it not, sir?
[00:55:24.009 --> 00:55:24.189]  Yes.
[00:55:26.531 --> 00:55:28.332]  Your phone just got a gigantic hum on it.
[00:55:28.352 --> 00:55:29.173]  Did you switch phones?
[00:55:29.853 --> 00:55:30.334]  Uh, no.
[00:55:31.575 --> 00:55:33.836]  I'm not calling for the best phone I've got in the house.
[00:55:33.856 --> 00:55:34.316]  I'm sorry.
[00:55:34.356 --> 00:55:34.617]  That's okay.
[00:55:34.637 --> 00:55:35.897]  You can just get closer to the jack, sir.
[00:55:35.917 --> 00:55:36.458]  I apologize.
[00:55:37.148 --> 00:55:37.928]  I'm having to stop you.
[00:55:37.968 --> 00:55:38.348]  Go ahead.
[00:55:39.669 --> 00:55:43.430]  We were talking during the break, what are some of the other key points that need to be made here about war crimes?
[00:55:44.670 --> 00:56:06.555]  The machining of life rafts, machine gunning of life rafts, machine gunning of stretcher bearers and first aid personnel while they were trying to rescue wounded, the use of napalm, the ignoring of internationally recognized
[00:56:08.691 --> 00:56:11.652]  Signs of friendly ships at sea.
[00:56:13.552 --> 00:56:15.292]  All of those are major war crimes.
[00:56:16.953 --> 00:56:36.996]  The USS Liberty Veterans Association, through legal counsel, retired Navy Admiral Merlin Starring, and another retired Navy Admiral by the name of Mark Hill, drew up the war crimes charges for the Liberty Veterans Association and they were presented formally
[00:56:37.985 --> 00:56:41.387]  On June the 8th of 2005.
[00:56:42.328 --> 00:56:50.652]  It is the duty of the Secretary of the Army to investigate any war crimes charges that are brought by United States citizens or military personnel.
[00:56:51.392 --> 00:56:56.655]  By the way, the guys writing it up have been at the highest levels of the naval JAG hierarchy.
[00:56:57.136 --> 00:56:57.376]  Yes.
[00:56:58.916 --> 00:56:59.157]  Yes.
[00:56:59.917 --> 00:57:05.660]  You've seen the... I'm sure you've seen the show... Many of your listeners have seen the show JAG.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.081]  It used to run on CBS.
[00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:11.403]  This is a guy with a big, broad, gold stripes on his sleeve.
[00:57:11.484 --> 00:57:13.225]  The head JAG officer.
[00:57:13.725 --> 00:57:15.627]  Merlin starring Admiral Merlin starring.
[00:57:16.328 --> 00:57:20.832]  And the Secretary of the Army has ignored those war crimes charges.
[00:57:21.412 --> 00:57:25.416]  It is his duty, under public law, to investigate them.
[00:57:25.636 --> 00:57:26.557]  But they can't do it!
[00:57:26.577 --> 00:57:27.538]  They can't do it now!
[00:57:27.598 --> 00:57:29.259]  The NSA intercepts have been released!
[00:57:32.982 --> 00:57:34.464]  Well, he certainly should, all the same.
[00:57:35.023 --> 00:57:37.004]  Well, we still have some survivors around.
[00:57:37.464 --> 00:57:40.665]  There ought to be an investigation made by Congress.
[00:57:41.306 --> 00:57:42.666]  They have never investigated it.
[00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:52.570]  In spite of all of the Israeli backers stating, oh, there's been 15 investigations, there's been 17 investigations.
[00:57:53.271 --> 00:57:54.751]  No, there was only one.
[00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:55.692]  Sorry.
[00:57:56.492 --> 00:58:01.114]  There was only one investigation, and that was the one conducted by the Admiral Kidd Court.
[00:58:02.339 --> 00:58:06.422]  And the conclusions were predetermined by the Johnson administration.
[00:58:07.023 --> 00:58:08.704]  Actually, I believe Lyndon Johnson himself.
[00:58:09.665 --> 00:58:15.169]  Well, Lyndon Johnson, I talked to the two admirals that heard it, came on the line and said, that Judy ship's going to the bottom before we help it.
[00:58:16.751 --> 00:58:18.072]  So, I mean, there you go.
[00:58:18.132 --> 00:58:22.635]  He was, he knew exactly what was going on when the aircraft carrier sent fighter jets to go save the ship.
[00:58:22.915 --> 00:58:23.856]  He said, turn it around.
[00:58:23.896 --> 00:58:24.316]  Did he not?
[00:58:26.758 --> 00:58:28.580]  I was made a back to the carrier America.
[00:58:29.309 --> 00:58:31.149]  Along with the operations officer.
[00:58:31.169 --> 00:58:33.290]  Stay there, we've got a break for 70 seconds, sir.
[00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:36.631]  We'll come right back and talk about that and get into this transcript.
[00:58:37.311 --> 00:58:39.211]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:39.271 --> 00:58:45.553]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.873 --> 00:58:46.673]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.469 --> 00:59:01.635]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.296 --> 00:59:03.117]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.878 --> 00:59:04.779]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:09.265]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.626 --> 00:59:13.711]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:24.006]  Congressman Ron Paul is scheduled to pop in later in this hour.
[00:59:24.026 --> 00:59:26.810]  He's in Congress right now, so it's fluid.
[00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:28.412]  He could come in early, could come in later.
[00:59:30.214 --> 00:59:35.515]  Dave Mustang, the founder of Megadeth, formerly with Metallica, one of the biggest rock bands in U.S.
[00:59:35.535 --> 00:59:44.757]  history, will be joining us coming up in the middle of the next hour because he's written an anti-UN, anti-New World Order album that does not mince words.
[00:59:45.117 --> 00:59:55.340]  Just like we had one of the chief guys and the main songwriter for another huge group, of course, on a few weeks ago.
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:57.360]  Just more and more people going public
[00:59:58.797 --> 01:00:01.278]  Duran Duran, by the way, against the New World Order.
[01:00:02.618 --> 01:00:07.059]  Huge news right now, ladies and gentlemen, out of the Chicago Tribune a few days ago.
[01:00:07.139 --> 01:00:13.241]  I mentioned it, but I really wanted to save it, the story, until we got this particular gentleman on, who we haven't interviewed before.
[01:00:13.261 --> 01:00:19.983]  We've interviewed much of the survivors of the crew, from first mates to doctors to admirals who took the calls from LBJ.
[01:00:20.703 --> 01:00:26.165]  The NSA has released spy aircraft tapes of the Israeli pilots to ground control.
[01:00:27.472 --> 01:00:29.714]  Being ordered, they're saying it's an American!
[01:00:30.234 --> 01:00:31.435]  Look, attack the ship!
[01:00:31.836 --> 01:00:38.361]  And that they did know from the onset of the attack in 1967, 40 years ago, what was happening.
[01:00:39.241 --> 01:00:46.087]  And so joining us is Bryce Lockwood, Marine Staff Sergeant, Russian language expert, recipient of the Silver Star for Heroism.
[01:00:46.267 --> 01:00:47.868]  This is a short segment, so let's get into that.
[01:00:48.149 --> 01:00:51.011]  I remember interviewing two of the admirals who were on the ship, took the call,
[01:00:51.736 --> 01:01:03.824]  Talking to others who had talked to them about it and their admissions So but but people hear this and they still can't believe it and the two different stories are only differ in a couple of words It's either LBJ says over the phone.
[01:01:04.324 --> 01:01:06.346]  I told you to recall those planes.
[01:01:06.826 --> 01:01:21.596]  Don't help that ship I don't care if it goes to the GD bottom to I want that ship going to the GD bottom and those tapes of those admirals and people saying that are all on my website Now I know you were in the belly of the ship under attack in the spy box, but what happened?
[01:01:22.957 --> 01:01:29.360]  Well, perhaps I should try and give you some quotes from Commander Lewis, who is the operations officer.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.982]  We were both medevac to the carrier America.
[01:01:32.862 --> 01:01:42.447]  While we were there, Admiral Geist, who was commander of Sixth Fleet, called Commander Armstrong into his stateroom and swore him to secrecy.
[01:01:42.808 --> 01:01:46.950]  He said, you're not to say anything about this conversation until after my death.
[01:01:48.286 --> 01:01:52.488]  But I want you to know, we did our best to get rescue aircraft to you.
[01:01:53.548 --> 01:02:02.031]  And then he quoted President Johnson as saying, I don't care if the GD ships sinks and every man drowns, I will not have my allies embarrassed.
[01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:04.012]  Now, you were told that to your face.
[01:02:05.572 --> 01:02:06.353]  No, I was not.
[01:02:06.493 --> 01:02:12.235]  It was told to Commander Lewis that Commander Lewis passed it along to those of us Liberty survivors at our reunions.
[01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:15.290]  Now, what about the quote I've had?
[01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:16.751]  I'm going to look up which admiral it was.
[01:02:16.791 --> 01:02:21.094]  I've had so many on the show that said, I want that GD ship on the bottom.
[01:02:21.214 --> 01:02:22.475]  I don't want our allies.
[01:02:22.915 --> 01:02:24.776]  I mean, there's a slight difference there.
[01:02:25.056 --> 01:02:26.077]  Have you heard that version?
[01:02:27.106 --> 01:02:27.586]  No, I've not.
[01:02:27.847 --> 01:02:28.147]  Okay.
[01:02:29.007 --> 01:02:30.648]  I just want to try to flesh that out a bit.
[01:02:30.708 --> 01:02:37.751]  But regardless, he's saying, I don't care if it goes to Judy Bottom, I don't want to embarrass our allies, and he indeed ordered the aircraft back.
[01:02:39.132 --> 01:02:48.457]  It's my understanding that Admiral McCain, Senator McCain's father, at the time was commander of U.S.
[01:02:48.517 --> 01:02:49.597]  forces in Europe, U.S.
[01:02:49.637 --> 01:02:50.678]  naval forces in Europe.
[01:02:51.778 --> 01:02:53.939]  I believe he was at London, England at the time.
[01:02:55.909 --> 01:02:58.650]  Admiral McCain is the one who ordered the aircraft back.
[01:02:59.531 --> 01:03:06.854]  Admiral Geist, who was Commander Sixth Fleet, said, this is an American ship, it's under attack, I want to hear that from higher authority.
[01:03:07.495 --> 01:03:10.796]  Robert McNamara told him the same thing, get those rescue aircraft back.
[01:03:11.796 --> 01:03:21.541]  And Admiral Geist said, I want to exercise my authority to appeal to the highest level of command, the President of the United States,
[01:03:22.809 --> 01:03:33.994]  It's my understanding from the conversations between Admiral Geist and Commander Armstrong that the President told him, I don't care if the GD's ship sinks and every man drowns, I will not have my allies embarrassed.
[01:03:34.975 --> 01:03:35.935]  Now think about that.
[01:03:37.736 --> 01:03:39.156]  That's LBJ for ya.
[01:03:39.777 --> 01:03:42.218]  Ladies and gentlemen, what a traitor, what a piece of filth.
[01:03:42.778 --> 01:03:44.219]  And McCain, another piece of filth.
[01:03:44.839 --> 01:03:45.639]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:46.079 --> 01:03:47.340]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:53.653 --> 01:03:58.616]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[01:03:58.916 --> 01:04:04.360]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.702]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[01:04:09.043 --> 01:04:12.045]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:04:12.365 --> 01:04:15.787]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[01:04:16.127 --> 01:04:25.474]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:04:25.734 --> 01:04:29.237]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:04:44.588 --> 01:05:01.396]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling the distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:01.756 --> 01:05:09.360]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.089 --> 01:05:17.132]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.552 --> 01:05:28.957]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.277 --> 01:05:32.818]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.218 --> 01:05:35.459]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.499 --> 01:05:39.281]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:52.702 --> 01:05:53.242]  Hey, Emily!
[01:05:53.523 --> 01:05:54.383]  Wow, you look great!
[01:05:54.603 --> 01:05:55.424]  I feel great!
[01:05:55.664 --> 01:05:57.445]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[01:05:57.725 --> 01:05:58.025]  Really?
[01:05:58.245 --> 01:05:58.666]  What is it?
[01:05:58.886 --> 01:05:59.346]  How does it work?
[01:05:59.546 --> 01:06:06.130]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:08.572]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[01:06:08.792 --> 01:06:14.095]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[01:06:14.435 --> 01:06:14.916]  That's it?
[01:06:15.196 --> 01:06:16.718]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[01:06:16.978 --> 01:06:17.699]  It is easy.
[01:06:17.899 --> 01:06:24.606]  Plus, the FDA says Flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:06:24.887 --> 01:06:26.388]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[01:06:26.709 --> 01:06:27.409]  That's amazing!
[01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:33.176]  And, the Benzonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:06:33.496 --> 01:06:33.816]  Wow!
[01:06:34.036 --> 01:06:35.137]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[01:06:35.437 --> 01:06:38.258]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[01:06:38.359 --> 01:06:41.540]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.

[01:06:46.343 --> 01:06:46.723]  Call today.
[01:06:46.823 --> 01:06:48.944]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.485 --> 01:07:05.885]  We're good.
[01:07:24.329 --> 01:07:36.300]  We'll be posting this interview up on our website, PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, and you can go through the transcript of the tapes, and the NSA has declassified.
[01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:37.360]  It's 40 years later.
[01:07:38.682 --> 01:07:43.446]  Tons, every month, of declassified transmissions and documents are being released.
[01:07:43.546 --> 01:07:45.007]  People are going into the stacks.
[01:07:45.888 --> 01:07:49.191]  You still have to get special authorization, unless you do a FOIA request, then you get it.
[01:07:49.531 --> 01:07:50.412]  And digging through them,
[01:07:51.477 --> 01:07:54.698]  And we find things like Operation Northwoods.
[01:07:55.839 --> 01:08:05.662]  A plan Kennedy said no to, and then it was mentioned why he was killed, to hijack jets by remote control, bomb DC, kill Marines, carry out sniper attacks.
[01:08:05.682 --> 01:08:09.323]  This was an operation that got green-lighted all the way through McNamara to the President.
[01:08:09.363 --> 01:08:10.164]  He said no.
[01:08:10.964 --> 01:08:13.685]  In there it also said blow up a ship and blame it on enemies.
[01:08:15.182 --> 01:08:22.507]  I was just curious, Bryce Lockwood, who was on board the USS Liberty and highly decorated, have you ever heard of Operation Northwoods?
[01:08:23.328 --> 01:08:23.668]  No, sir.
[01:08:24.688 --> 01:08:28.351]  Does it surprise you to know that that was declassified a few years ago?
[01:08:29.551 --> 01:08:30.632]  No, it actually doesn't.
[01:08:31.413 --> 01:08:43.040]  I have a copy of a transcript from the Kennedy years of a conversation between then General Curtis LeMay and the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General David M. Shoup.
[01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:53.722]  And the conversation went something along the lines of setting up a ship to be attacked by the Soviets and blaming it on them and then
[01:08:54.352 --> 01:08:57.155]  precipitating a major world event.
[01:08:57.315 --> 01:09:00.298]  Now see, I didn't know that, and that's why history is so big.
[01:09:00.358 --> 01:09:01.239]  It's wet than breath.
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.220]  It's so huge.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:08.487]  You try to study one period and say Roman history or Japanese history, you'll, in your whole lifetime, you can't learn it all.
[01:09:08.987 --> 01:09:11.390]  And there, I just learned from you, you just learned from me.
[01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:17.076]  Yeah, Operation Northwoods, they were gonna basically carry out 9-11 style attacks, and
[01:09:19.787 --> 01:09:22.892]  We even had people board aircraft, but it had all sorts of stuff.
[01:09:22.932 --> 01:09:24.714]  Kill astronauts, blame it on the Soviets.
[01:09:25.215 --> 01:09:28.760]  Yeah, just Google Operation Northwoods, ABC News, Baltimore Sun reported on it.
[01:09:29.681 --> 01:09:31.504]  Very, very interesting is all I can say.
[01:09:34.546 --> 01:09:41.029]  That particular incident is news to me, but I'm certainly going to try and look that up.
[01:09:41.049 --> 01:09:47.152]  I know I'm catching you off guard, but maybe after the show you can think of where it is and tell me, sir, or email me.
[01:09:47.612 --> 01:09:55.255]  Where specifically can I find the head of the Air Force, who is an admitted psychopath, talking to someone else about staging events?
[01:09:56.095 --> 01:09:58.777]  That was Commander of the Marine Corps, General David Shoup.
[01:10:00.743 --> 01:10:05.886]  I'll have to do some digging to find that for you, Alex, but that shouldn't be that much of a problem.
[01:10:05.926 --> 01:10:08.247]  I can come up with that and see to it that you get a copy.
[01:10:08.887 --> 01:10:11.728]  Our folks can probably look forward to it and post it in the Prison Planet Forum.
[01:10:12.649 --> 01:10:13.229]  War crimes.
[01:10:13.249 --> 01:10:14.430]  Let's talk about war crimes.
[01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:19.372]  We started mentioning that earlier in the segment, but now we have the transmissions of the Israelis.
[01:10:19.412 --> 01:10:27.036]  I'm sitting here looking at them in the Chicago Tribune saying that, just as the pilot said years ago, that it was an American ship.
[01:10:29.199 --> 01:10:43.851]  There should be a complete investigation done by Congress.
[01:10:44.932 --> 01:10:46.414]  You can't get a Congressman to touch it.
[01:10:48.295 --> 01:10:56.342]  I think that if you go through the records of most Congress people, where their contributions come from, they're required by law to be made public.
[01:10:56.934 --> 01:11:07.463]  I think you'll be shocked at how much money our Congress people and Senators are getting from the American-Israel Political Affairs Committee.
[01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:11.186]  It is absolutely shocking how much power they have.
[01:11:11.907 --> 01:11:25.298]  I just found out recently, I graduated from the same college as Dr. Jerry Falwell, Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Missouri, and I was just informed recently that
[01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:39.936]  Jerry Falwell was paid off quite handsomely by the Israelis for his complete unquestioned backing of the State of Israel, to the tune of a Learjet aircraft worth 1.6 million dollars.
[01:11:41.456 --> 01:11:44.558]  Yeah, all total, Israel's given him over 4 mil that we know of.
[01:11:45.218 --> 01:11:45.818]  Jerry Falwell?
[01:11:46.218 --> 01:11:46.399]  Yeah.
[01:11:48.299 --> 01:11:51.881]  And it's the same thing with other preachers around the country, and
[01:11:53.331 --> 01:11:58.835]  Now we have known dual citizens running almost every major federal department.
[01:11:59.355 --> 01:11:59.976]  It's pretty bad.
[01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:14.966]  I wasn't aware that there was quite that much money that had been given to Dr. Falwell, but that would certainly explain why he comes on television even after his death and advocates people donating $350 to get a Soviet person of Jewish extract to
[01:12:22.239 --> 01:12:25.322]  Travel back to Israel and set up their citizenship in Israel.
[01:12:26.663 --> 01:12:29.485]  Well, you know, I've been criticized because I don't hate Israel.
[01:12:29.586 --> 01:12:31.507]  I know most governments are corrupt throughout history.
[01:12:32.068 --> 01:12:32.728]  I'm a Christian.
[01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:34.750]  You know, I brought up a Baptist.
[01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:36.752]  I'm really non-denominational now.
[01:12:37.572 --> 01:12:40.415]  Excuse me for interrupting, Alex, but I don't hate Israel.
[01:12:41.076 --> 01:12:42.837]  I really don't hate Israel.
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:48.242]  I really want your listeners to make sure of that.
[01:12:50.009 --> 01:12:51.670]  I think they have every right to exist.
[01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:53.111]  Oh no, let me stop you, sir.
[01:12:53.591 --> 01:12:54.691]  I mean, I'm agreeing with you.
[01:12:55.012 --> 01:13:15.861]  I mean, I'm saying I'm brought up a Baptist, I'm brought up, you know, literally being taught to worship Israel at church, and I have Jewish friends, I know half the folks in Israel are against all these wars, but yes, it's just like we've had criminal governments, just like Germany's had bad governments, it is not a sin, and you're a pastor, and so tell me if I'm correct, to say that
[01:13:16.321 --> 01:13:18.182]  To rebuke Israel when it's corrupt and evil.
[01:13:18.242 --> 01:13:19.543]  Isn't that what all the prophets did?
[01:13:20.484 --> 01:13:21.004]  Exactly.
[01:13:21.825 --> 01:13:22.345]  Exactly.
[01:13:23.806 --> 01:13:34.173]  And they should be rebuked very strenuously for the war crimes that they've committed against the people of Lebanon, against the United Arab Republic back in the Six Days War in 1967.
[01:13:34.213 --> 01:13:34.793]  I don't understand why
[01:13:41.578 --> 01:13:44.019]  Excuse me, I'm getting some age on me now.
[01:13:44.099 --> 01:13:46.080]  My mind gets a little fuzzy from time to time.
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:14:10.469]  I can't recall who the President of Egypt was at the time of the Six Days War, but he was anxious to get back to Sinai Peninsula after the war, and there was the accords with Menachem Begin and Jimmy Carter, and the President of Egypt were all given the Nobel Peace Prize for settling
[01:14:12.045 --> 01:14:12.845]  Well, I've had the
[01:14:38.013 --> 01:14:39.374]  That's a real good question.
[01:14:39.394 --> 01:14:43.976]  I know that there are some people, we had a discussion here in Springfield at one of the major Springfield libraries last fall.
[01:15:07.451 --> 01:15:24.002]  Dr. Ray McGovern, who is a retired CIA senior officer, it was his job to brief the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, I believe, on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and the President on Tuesday and Thursday.
[01:15:24.062 --> 01:15:26.303]  It was Reagan and Bush, yeah.
[01:15:26.743 --> 01:15:35.770]  It was Ray McGovern with his responsibility to brief these most senior people, the President,
[01:15:37.026 --> 01:15:38.768]  Hey, it's okay.
[01:15:38.788 --> 01:15:41.210]  I understand there's a lot going on.
[01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:45.634]  Looking here at the Chicago Tribune, going through the transcript, it has the aircraft bombing
[01:16:05.676 --> 01:16:07.138]  And they bomb it the first time.
[01:16:07.158 --> 01:16:08.319]  They've already said it's American.
[01:16:08.339 --> 01:16:09.520]  They say they don't want to bomb it.
[01:16:10.381 --> 01:16:22.253]  And the teletype, it says the transcript, Block remembered seeing, we're teletypists, way beyond top secret, some kind of pilots did not want to attack, Block said.
[01:16:22.273 --> 01:16:25.577]  The pilot said, this is an American ship, do we still want to attack?
[01:16:25.877 --> 01:16:28.440]  And the ground control came back and said, yes, follow orders.
[01:16:29.392 --> 01:16:35.914]  And it goes on to say after the ship had gotten radio out, that they panicked and wanted them to finish off the job.
[01:16:36.254 --> 01:16:42.496]  You know, that after you guys were able to string a wire and get the message off, that then the Israelis really panicked and said, hurry up, kill them!
[01:16:45.717 --> 01:16:47.398]  I don't doubt that in the least, Alex.
[01:16:50.959 --> 01:16:53.260]  Oh gosh, I'm sorry, my mind just keeps going blank.
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:57.121]  And it says right here, it says, but sir, it's an American ship!
[01:16:58.294 --> 01:17:01.356]  Some of those pilots were trained right here in the United States.
[01:17:02.676 --> 01:17:09.700]  And they certainly must have had some friendships they struck up while they were going to pilot school here in the United States.
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:10.540]  Well, here's the question.
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:12.301]  Why did Geiss send the following orders?
[01:17:12.321 --> 01:17:13.982]  I mean, at least he questioned, unlike others.
[01:17:14.402 --> 01:17:15.963]  I mean, why did the Israelis follow orders?
[01:17:16.003 --> 01:17:17.523]  I mean, at least they did question.
[01:17:19.484 --> 01:17:20.465]  Yes, they did question.
[01:17:20.905 --> 01:17:22.646]  Incidentally, we had a reunion in
[01:17:24.121 --> 01:17:28.945]  1992, it was our 25th anniversary reunion in Rapid City, South Dakota.
[01:17:30.526 --> 01:17:35.090]  Joe Tully, Captain Joe Tully, was the skipper of the USS Saratoga.
[01:17:36.090 --> 01:17:39.193]  And Captain Tully called me over to him and shook my hand.
[01:17:39.213 --> 01:17:47.939]  He says, Marines said, I want you to know, we did our best to get help to you, but I was overpowered by the President himself.
[01:17:50.761 --> 01:17:52.943]  Captain Joe Tully, skipper of the Saratoga.
[01:17:54.531 --> 01:18:01.197]  But still, if I was a naval officer and the President said, stick children into meat grinders, I wouldn't do it.
[01:18:01.317 --> 01:18:03.019]  I guess it's that training?
[01:18:03.059 --> 01:18:05.741]  I mean, to follow an order to let your own people die?
[01:18:05.761 --> 01:18:09.184]  I don't know what to say about that.
[01:18:10.245 --> 01:18:17.592]  Well, for anybody that doubts that in this corrupt society now that our police won't follow orders and things like that, you better think twice, folks, because
[01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:21.474]  Because I'll just follow orders no matter what.
[01:18:21.654 --> 01:18:23.956]  It just really causes bad things to happen.
[01:18:24.436 --> 01:18:29.698]  Lyndon Johnson and Secretary McNamara should have been tried for treason for the Liberty incident.
[01:18:30.879 --> 01:18:31.319]  Stay there.
[01:18:31.379 --> 01:18:31.819]  Quick break.
[01:18:31.839 --> 01:18:34.420]  I want to come back in a final five-minute segment with you, sir.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:38.162]  I really appreciate Bryce Lockwood, one of the heroes of the USS Liberty, for joining us.
[01:18:38.762 --> 01:18:48.207]  To talk about any other key points that we've missed or have a discussion on the other side, then we're scheduled to have the Congressman Ron Paul popping in for the segment and then Dave Mustang.
[01:18:48.997 --> 01:18:50.578]  I'm one of the top rock groups out there.
[01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:58.063]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:18:58.263 --> 01:19:02.705]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[01:19:02.886 --> 01:19:16.894]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey Light Water Purifier, an LED Base, two Berkey Sport Filtration Bottles, the Berkey Battery Adapter, the Berkey MP Solar Charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:19:17.134 --> 01:19:36.329]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.
[01:19:36.549 --> 01:19:40.172]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[01:19:40.312 --> 01:19:42.994]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:19:47.296 --> 01:19:55.358]  This is a market alert from Midas Resources.
[01:19:55.738 --> 01:20:05.739]  Since August 9th, the Fed has created and injected $200 billion into the financial markets to keep them afloat, ignoring the hyperinflationary hangover that is the sure result.
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:11.760]  Data released by the New York Federal Reserve shows that foreign central banks have cut their stash of U.S.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:14.601]  Treasuries by $48 billion since late July.
[01:20:15.453 --> 01:20:18.495]  With falls of 32 billion in the last two weeks alone.
[01:20:18.975 --> 01:20:21.036]  Could China be quietly dumping the dollar?
[01:20:21.957 --> 01:20:24.899]  The quality of your life depends on the quality of your currency.
[01:20:25.139 --> 01:20:27.120]  And the quality of the dollar is poor.
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.061]  Because the quantity is so high.
[01:20:29.442 --> 01:20:32.263]  Printing money out of thin air has disastrous results.
[01:20:32.403 --> 01:20:35.225]  Victimizing middle class citizens and discouraging savings.
[01:20:35.785 --> 01:20:40.268]  If you have been considering precious metals as a hedge against inflation, you need to act now.
[01:20:40.688 --> 01:20:43.250]  Procrastination is the mother of lost opportunities.
[01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:45.332]  Call me, Tom Andrew at 1-800-606-1294.
[01:20:45.412 --> 01:20:45.613]  That's 1-800-606-1294.
[01:20:53.152 --> 01:20:53.832]  It's a fact.
[01:20:54.092 --> 01:21:01.636]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:21:01.796 --> 01:21:10.340]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, all debt has become mathematically impossible to repay, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:21.245]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:21:21.485 --> 01:21:27.590]  We can terminate your unsecure debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:21:27.811 --> 01:21:32.875]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:37.579]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:21:37.759 --> 01:21:39.561]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:21:39.621 --> 01:21:39.901]  That's 877-943-8600.

[01:21:40.441 --> 01:21:42.323]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:21:49.571 --> 01:21:50.235]  We're good.
[01:21:54.082 --> 01:21:55.603]  Get the best of both worlds.
[01:21:56.023 --> 01:22:01.125]  Solar power for your household essentials and a backup generator all in one.
[01:22:01.305 --> 01:22:02.705]  Perfect for hurricane seasons.
[01:22:03.005 --> 01:22:06.506]  No long gas lines, no fumes, and no noise.
[01:22:07.227 --> 01:22:09.888]  Lower your electric bill and be prepared year-round.
[01:22:10.548 --> 01:22:12.869]  Complete solar kits for under $1,200.
[01:22:13.109 --> 01:22:17.210]  See the complete solar power generator kit at KenSolar.com.
[01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:21.212]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.
[01:22:24.318 --> 01:22:26.799]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:22:27.279 --> 01:22:29.180]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:33.061]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:22:33.722 --> 01:22:40.184]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[01:22:40.964 --> 01:22:43.165]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[01:22:43.545 --> 01:22:43.785]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:43.805 --> 01:22:44.265]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.912 --> 01:23:02.893]  We are joined by Bryce Lockwood.
[01:23:02.913 --> 01:23:11.818]  We have one little short segment left here, then Congressman Ron Paul is going to be joining us.
[01:23:23.539 --> 01:23:25.020]  Absolutely incredible story.
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:32.782]  Incredible that even the Chicago Tribune has got the transcripts where they didn't want to attack, were ordered to, just as one of the pilots went public seven years ago and admitted.
[01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:39.224]  But still the neocons said, no, no, Israel-Levinson was sweet when their own pilot admitted it.
[01:23:40.124 --> 01:23:42.705]  They were ordered three times, attack, and they did attack.
[01:23:44.145 --> 01:23:49.447]  But George Butler, who has a show right here on the Genesis Network Saturday nights, a friend of mine for many years,
[01:23:50.282 --> 01:23:51.843]  I guess I ought to talk to people more.
[01:23:51.863 --> 01:23:53.483]  I didn't know... I knew George had been in the military.
[01:23:53.503 --> 01:23:54.964]  I didn't know George was involved with the Liberty.
[01:23:55.184 --> 01:23:57.085]  At least heard some of this and saw some of it happen.
[01:23:57.585 --> 01:23:59.006]  Uh, George, we've just got a few minutes here.
[01:23:59.066 --> 01:24:01.627]  Tell your story real fast to, uh, Mr. Lockwood.
[01:24:02.087 --> 01:24:03.468]  Okay, uh, Mr. Lockwood?
[01:24:03.828 --> 01:24:04.528]  Yes, sir, George.
[01:24:04.728 --> 01:24:05.628]  I was ASA.
[01:24:05.668 --> 01:24:12.872]  I was in Germany, West Berlin, uh, Torfelsberg and all that, but I was out of the service in the 66, but I had friends at Azmera.
[01:24:13.852 --> 01:24:14.172]  Okay.
[01:24:14.412 --> 01:24:17.914]  And they were monitoring that ship's, uh, communications during that attack.
[01:24:18.414 --> 01:24:18.574]  Yes.
[01:24:19.355 --> 01:24:26.282]  And so I don't know if these recently released intercepts are showing any traffic being monitored from Esmera or not.
[01:24:26.563 --> 01:24:27.003]  I don't know.
[01:24:28.284 --> 01:24:36.232]  The transcript that I have is from off the Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska.
[01:24:36.673 --> 01:24:37.113]  Okay.
[01:24:37.454 --> 01:24:41.418]  Now talking to your friends, George, who are in your old unit, what did they say they heard?
[01:24:42.031 --> 01:24:51.961]  Well, we have a meeting monthly, we used to up in Richardson, Texas, with a bunch of Army Security Agency people, and discussing it, you know, with them.
[01:24:52.281 --> 01:24:58.007]  They were hearing the attack, and they were hearing sometimes both sides of the communications.
[01:24:59.288 --> 01:25:02.772]  This is up on a high mountain there, close to Ethiopia.
[01:25:03.248 --> 01:25:03.648]  Sure, sure.
[01:25:03.688 --> 01:25:05.490]  What did they think while they were hearing all this?
[01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.890]  What did they say?
[01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:09.634]  They understood very quickly within hours that there was an attack.
[01:25:09.714 --> 01:25:14.238]  It was a concerted attack, intentional attack by Israel against a U.S.
[01:25:14.278 --> 01:25:14.598]  vessel.
[01:25:14.898 --> 01:25:16.160]  Were they mad at the cover-up?
[01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:19.483]  Oh, they were mad as hell, but NSA has a memorial site.
[01:25:19.543 --> 01:25:21.304]  Is that right, Mr. Lockwood, on NSA?
[01:25:21.364 --> 01:25:22.125]  Yes, yes.
[01:25:22.145 --> 01:25:23.586]  But you know what they've done to that site?
[01:25:23.606 --> 01:25:24.627]  No.
[01:25:24.767 --> 01:25:27.710]  They made it more inaccessible than it used to be a few years ago.
[01:25:29.497 --> 01:25:32.759]  Hard to find on the NSA site than it was three or four years ago.
[01:25:33.179 --> 01:25:33.819]  Not surprising.
[01:25:33.839 --> 01:25:39.222]  You have to dig down into the NSA site to really find the Liberty Memorial section.
[01:25:40.983 --> 01:25:43.144]  I've been after this thing for years myself.
[01:25:43.344 --> 01:25:52.309]  Like, Carl Wickersworth came out years ago and I sent him a bunch of information, KTSA and San Antonio, so this has been really dear to my heart too.
[01:25:53.890 --> 01:25:55.531]  Thank you so much for calling, George.
[01:25:56.465 --> 01:26:03.328]  Anyway, I understand your predicament, and you being there on The Best Will I Know, it was really... George, you ought to... You really get a kick into the truth, don't you?
[01:26:03.348 --> 01:26:06.029]  You ought to get Bryce Lockwood on your show.
[01:26:06.049 --> 01:26:07.749]  If it's alright, I can have John at the network.
[01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:09.910]  Bryce, is it okay if we give George your number?
[01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:10.590]  You bet.
[01:26:11.031 --> 01:26:14.672]  Yeah, well, get that to me, and then we'll have him on the show as soon as we can.
[01:26:14.832 --> 01:26:16.493]  Okay, well, we'll give you the number right now.
[01:26:16.573 --> 01:26:18.914]  John, please give him the number while you're busy dialing Ron Paul.
[01:26:19.294 --> 01:26:19.994]  Thank you, George.
[01:26:20.014 --> 01:26:20.674]  Good to hear from you.
[01:26:20.934 --> 01:26:22.055]  I mean, what a small world.
[01:26:22.135 --> 01:26:22.855]  I know George.
[01:26:22.875 --> 01:26:25.096]  He's a great guy here involved in the Freedom Movement.
[01:26:25.816 --> 01:26:29.177]  That is amazing.
[01:26:29.457 --> 01:26:32.797]  That is absolutely amazing.
[01:26:33.498 --> 01:26:40.699]  Alex, I thank you so much for this opportunity.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:50.221]  Perhaps I've aired some things that, I don't know, maybe should have been said, but I tried to tell the truth as much as I possibly could.
[01:26:51.064 --> 01:26:51.965]  Well, no, sir.
[01:26:52.025 --> 01:27:03.714]  I mean, you've told much of what we already have confirmed by other sources in the new developments and a few other interesting tidbits, but the bottom line, what are the defenders of the bad actions of Israel going to do now?
[01:27:04.515 --> 01:27:05.415]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:27:06.016 --> 01:27:07.297]  They can't just run and hide.
[01:27:09.618 --> 01:27:12.241]  I didn't realize that this would also run in the Boston Globe.
[01:27:12.641 --> 01:27:18.585]  I mean, this is a quarter of the American population that have had this story for the first time in 40 years.
[01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:21.031]  It's in a bunch of newspapers.
[01:27:21.091 --> 01:27:27.833]  If you type USS Liberty into Google and click on News, it'll search News, and it's dozens of hits.
[01:27:28.053 --> 01:27:30.074]  It is all over the newspapers.
[01:27:30.114 --> 01:27:30.634]  Let me look here.
[01:27:31.455 --> 01:27:35.296]  Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun.
[01:27:36.136 --> 01:27:39.518]  There's one more here that I printed out, and I only printed a few of these.
[01:27:40.418 --> 01:27:40.878]  My goodness.
[01:27:41.198 --> 01:27:44.540]  So this particular article by John Crescent.
[01:27:45.538 --> 01:27:49.179]  John Crookson is all over the place, and a bunch of other articles have been written about that.
[01:27:49.919 --> 01:27:51.300]  I'd say it's in the hundreds now, sir.
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:58.782]  Incidentally, John Crookson is a Pulitzer Prize winner for journalism, so this is no fly-by-night author of this article.
[01:27:58.982 --> 01:27:59.842]  You know, I didn't know that.
[01:27:59.882 --> 01:28:03.183]  We called him up and he gave us your number, and he was real nice.
[01:28:03.243 --> 01:28:04.884]  I didn't know I was talking to a Pulitzer Prize winner.
[01:28:04.924 --> 01:28:07.545]  I've got a... I didn't either when you first called me.
[01:28:07.605 --> 01:28:09.125]  I found out from a third party.
[01:28:09.245 --> 01:28:14.147]  Actually, it was Jim Ennis, who is the author of the book, Assault on the Liberty, that informed me that...
[01:28:15.357 --> 01:28:17.219]  Mr. Crutzen was a Pulitzer Prize winner.
[01:28:17.519 --> 01:28:21.782]  Well, I'm going to call Crutzen back and get him on and maybe you on and get George Butler on at the same time.
[01:28:22.062 --> 01:28:24.284]  God bless you and thanks for coming on, Mr. Lockwood.
[01:28:24.484 --> 01:28:25.565]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:28:25.625 --> 01:28:26.486]  I really appreciate it.
[01:28:26.666 --> 01:28:27.066]  You bet.
[01:28:27.567 --> 01:28:31.209]  You know, most of those men haven't lived to see the truth come out, but a lot of them have.
[01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:35.593]  And it's bittersweet, but at least there's some sweet to the bitter.
[01:28:35.873 --> 01:28:36.934]  That's better than nothing.
[01:28:37.934 --> 01:28:41.077]  I tell you, the people that told lies about this look really bad right now.
[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:46.949]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.872 --> 01:28:50.559]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.414 --> 01:28:55.537]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[01:28:55.897 --> 01:28:58.981]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:28:59.221 --> 01:29:03.806]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:29:04.167 --> 01:29:06.790]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:29:07.330 --> 01:29:14.018]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:29:14.458 --> 01:29:19.681]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:29:20.122 --> 01:29:21.783]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:29:22.303 --> 01:29:25.585]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:29:26.145 --> 01:29:36.532]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the US was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[01:29:36.892 --> 01:29:42.295]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and shipping.
[01:29:42.615 --> 01:29:43.916]  Share the oil company's secrets
[01:29:43.916 --> 01:29:44.276]  Call 888-873-7371 today!
[01:29:53.946 --> 01:29:55.106]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[01:29:55.226 --> 01:29:57.507]  I'm the New Dramatical Report here on Genesis.
[01:29:57.647 --> 01:30:00.627]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax NutraCyticals U.S.
[01:30:00.687 --> 01:30:01.347]  is a real thing.
[01:30:01.427 --> 01:30:08.309]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh and never before available garlic.
[01:30:08.429 --> 01:30:19.311]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB, and it kills fleshy bacteria, MRSA, Acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[01:30:19.431 --> 01:30:19.951]  We're good to go.
[01:30:40.703 --> 01:30:44.430]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:45.813]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[01:30:45.873 --> 01:30:47.796]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[01:30:53.268 --> 01:30:55.650]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[01:30:56.170 --> 01:30:57.672]  After a pedicure they look great.
[01:30:58.012 --> 01:31:01.835]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[01:31:02.275 --> 01:31:04.477]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[01:31:04.898 --> 01:31:08.240]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:31:08.641 --> 01:31:11.103]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:31:11.603 --> 01:31:12.644]  What's that name again?
[01:31:13.044 --> 01:31:14.225]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:31:14.605 --> 01:31:15.786]  It's CalX.
[01:31:16.187 --> 01:31:18.028]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:31:18.388 --> 01:31:20.230]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[01:31:20.996 --> 01:31:29.618]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:31:30.038 --> 01:31:35.760]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:47.283]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:31:47.941 --> 01:31:49.043]  Hey, here's a drugstore.
[01:31:49.384 --> 01:31:50.045]  I'll be right back.
[01:31:50.185 --> 01:31:51.888]  I'm getting some Calyx for my heels.
[01:31:55.684 --> 01:32:00.006]  In constant sorrow His face I am the man of the hour
[01:32:20.407 --> 01:32:21.928]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:22.329 --> 01:32:25.851]  Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, one of the top rock bands out there.
[01:32:25.872 --> 01:32:28.293]  Formerly with Metallica as well.
[01:32:28.313 --> 01:32:29.615]  He'll be joining us in the next hour.
[01:32:30.395 --> 01:32:32.277]  He has gone anti-New World Order.
[01:32:32.557 --> 01:32:35.739]  His whole new album is all about the New World Order and how he must defeat it.
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:39.522]  And we have one of the top guys, of course, from Duran Duran on a week ago.
[01:32:40.884 --> 01:32:46.168]  It's just everybody is starting to wake up and one of the people driving that is the Ron Paul revolution.
[01:32:47.387 --> 01:32:55.518]  And the doctor, the Vietnam veteran, the family man, the father, the congressman with the best voting record in modern U.S.
[01:32:55.538 --> 01:33:04.990]  history, the guy that would get us out of the United Nations, the man that would abolish the Federal Reserve, the person that would put us back on to sound money principles,
[01:33:05.879 --> 01:33:10.424]  He is definitely the medicine this ailing country needs is Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:33:10.804 --> 01:33:17.611]  And they just raised a record five plus million dollars in the last quarter dwarfing what many of the other top tier candidates made.
[01:33:17.631 --> 01:33:21.415]  They're now six to one in major Las Vegas odds with a trajectory
[01:33:22.095 --> 01:33:27.179]  Of winning if his growth rate in the next 50 to 90 days continues.
[01:33:27.239 --> 01:33:31.062]  If this is it, I want to see everybody intensify your giving.
[01:33:31.822 --> 01:33:33.183]  I see yard signs all over.
[01:33:33.504 --> 01:33:36.926]  When I'm in LA or New York, I see signs, Ron Paul signs up.
[01:33:37.386 --> 01:33:38.767]  When I'm in Dallas, I see them.
[01:33:38.987 --> 01:33:41.249]  They're all around my business where I'm based.
[01:33:41.749 --> 01:33:45.132]  Congressmen, we salute you and I salute everybody that's supporting you.
[01:33:45.172 --> 01:33:50.616]  This Ron Paul revolution is just absolutely going into overdrive.
[01:33:51.303 --> 01:33:56.545]  Well, thank you, and we have to salute all those supporters who have endorsed these views in the Constitution.
[01:33:56.585 --> 01:34:06.808]  That's what really is at stake here, and I'm so pleased to find out that our strength is that good, you know, and that there are that many people who care, so there's reason to be optimistic.
[01:34:07.348 --> 01:34:10.589]  This is a lot better than you even thought it was going to be, Congressman.
[01:34:10.809 --> 01:34:12.410]  What did you think on
[01:34:13.485 --> 01:34:22.832]  Well, I always think there's, you know, that you can't predict the future and therefore I never say, oh, you can't win or I will win, so I sort of avoid the two extremes.
[01:34:30.917 --> 01:34:34.601]  But I would say that it's doing much better than I had anticipated.
[01:34:34.621 --> 01:34:39.807]  I was rather cynical about it all, because you and others have always said, run, run, run.
[01:34:39.827 --> 01:34:45.453]  And I said, well, I don't know if our numbers are strong enough, and I don't know whether the young people will rally.
[01:34:45.534 --> 01:34:50.319]  So I was too pessimistic, and there were more people who were already informed.
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:54.541]  I'm really impressed by how many new people come in.
[01:34:54.581 --> 01:35:01.184]  The new people are flocking to us, and I think this means that the young people are a lot smarter than we give them credit for.
[01:35:01.224 --> 01:35:06.466]  They're realizing that we've dumped on them, and they realize, look, they're inheriting.
[01:35:06.886 --> 01:35:13.849]  So I think this has all just come together, and then with radio talk shows and the Internet has just made this thing grow by leaps and bounds.
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:16.161]  It's growing exponentially.
[01:35:17.021 --> 01:35:22.983]  Though every time your name gets mentioned on Fox, CNN, MSNBC, they say, yeah, but he can't win.
[01:35:23.063 --> 01:35:27.064]  Within seconds, they blurt it out like it's a talking point, Congressman.
[01:35:27.244 --> 01:35:29.705]  But that seems, well, A, do you think it's a talking point?
[01:35:29.765 --> 01:35:34.507]  And B, that seems to be enraging the public even more and backfiring on them.
[01:35:35.287 --> 01:35:36.308]  Well, it does.
[01:35:36.829 --> 01:35:38.930]  It doesn't discourage our supporters.
[01:35:39.050 --> 01:35:41.011]  It sort of energizes everybody.
[01:35:41.752 --> 01:35:51.379]  And now that we have proven that we could raise money, you know, they always claimed there were just a few of us out there that cared and that they were bloggers and they were manipulating the Internet.
[01:35:51.959 --> 01:35:56.422]  And, well, you can't manipulate to the point where you get 35,000 new donors who average about $40 apiece.
[01:35:59.624 --> 01:36:11.168]  You know, the other ones that raise a lot of money, you have to realize they get their money from those who want to buy government, you know, the special interests.
[01:36:11.548 --> 01:36:14.309]  That's why they'll invest 60, 70, 80 million dollars.
[01:36:14.329 --> 01:36:25.312]  The miraculous thing about this is people are coming to us just to be free, you know, just to be left alone, to be able to keep their own money and do the necessary things like sound money and
[01:36:25.772 --> 01:36:26.592]  We're good to go.
[01:36:47.401 --> 01:36:52.304]  In about a third of the country, but still, if the poll numbers are high enough, they're not going to be able to steal elections.
[01:36:53.124 --> 01:37:06.572]  I really know, intellectually, following this trajectory, that if the growth continues at this current rate, and that's what Las Vegas is saying, and they can't be wrong because they got bets being placed on it, you're going to get the Republican nomination.
[01:37:07.654 --> 01:37:13.555]  Well, you know, that is a distinct possibility, but I also know that a lot of work has to be done.
[01:37:14.215 --> 01:37:19.776]  We have to translate what we've done so far into actual voting in the primaries.
[01:37:19.796 --> 01:37:26.418]  So, it's not smooth sailing, but it certainly is possible, and at the rate we're going, there's a very good chance.
[01:37:27.058 --> 01:37:32.559]  Would you say that it's accurate to make the statement that you are definitely, that we are definitely with you in the fight?
[01:37:34.222 --> 01:37:35.745]  I don't think there's any doubt about it.
[01:37:36.025 --> 01:37:40.093]  I think that the group of people who are with us are growing all the time.
[01:37:42.327 --> 01:37:46.188]  You know, the media always wants to ask me, what is your target?
[01:37:46.228 --> 01:37:47.449]  When are you going to drop out?
[01:37:47.589 --> 01:37:51.810]  Do you have to be first in New Hampshire or you'll drop out?
[01:37:51.850 --> 01:37:53.650]  I said, no, I haven't even thought about things like that.
[01:37:53.710 --> 01:38:04.213]  As long as we keep growing and improving and our numbers are growing and we raise the funds, you stay in there until mathematically something forces you to be excluded.
[01:38:06.934 --> 01:38:34.111]  Well, by every indicator of grassroots, whether it's IP one-vote internet voting, which I think is more scientific than a lot of the, you know, Angus and Reed and Gallup-type polls, by every other indicator of grassroots, whether it's MySpace or YouTube or Meetup or Town Hall or Facebook, you are dwarfing, in almost every case, you have more members and more supporters in all those grassroots communities than all the other candidates combined with both parties!
[01:38:35.031 --> 01:38:43.095]  It makes you wonder how the polling is done, because if the polling is honest, then you wonder where's the disconnect.
[01:38:43.555 --> 01:38:49.478]  But maybe the polling isn't absolutely accurate, maybe they're not polling the people that are likely to vote.
[01:38:49.798 --> 01:38:57.041]  But I think once we get a supporter, the percentage chance of them voting are much greater than those who are so disgruntled.
[01:38:57.061 --> 01:38:59.882]  The disgruntled Democrats and the disgruntled Republicans.
[01:39:01.743 --> 01:39:14.528]  I foresee a low turnout if you don't have somebody there that will really champion our cause and really want to change in direction, because I think the longer this campaign goes on, the more mellow everybody becomes.
[01:39:14.548 --> 01:39:15.469]  They just mush.
[01:39:15.509 --> 01:39:16.509]  They say nothing.
[01:39:16.549 --> 01:39:21.411]  The Democrats get worse, and even our other Republicans are not saying that much.
[01:39:21.431 --> 01:39:23.032]  They're not fiscal conservatives.
[01:39:23.052 --> 01:39:28.073]  They don't want to talk about monetary policy, and there's so little said.
[01:39:28.093 --> 01:39:29.154]  So for that reason, I think
[01:39:29.494 --> 01:39:34.878]  The people get more disgusted than those people who have finally figured it out that we're going in the wrong direction.
[01:39:34.918 --> 01:39:36.339]  I think they're coming to our campaign.
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:38.221]  Congressman, I said this...
[01:39:39.051 --> 01:39:48.753]  Six, seven months ago when you first announced, it was common sense to me, but now the oddsmakers have said it, a lot of political analysts have said it, the Republicans really aren't running against Hillary.
[01:39:48.813 --> 01:39:50.373]  They know the baton's being passed.
[01:39:50.393 --> 01:39:57.355]  We've never seen a discrepancy where we've got, in any election, where one campaign has got double what the other party does.
[01:39:57.615 --> 01:39:58.795]  Hillary's got that now.
[01:39:58.935 --> 01:40:07.397]  Clearly, the establishment's saying this is a non-campaign, but then all the oddsmakers and experts are saying, but Ron Paul, he could beat Hillary.
[01:40:07.657 --> 01:40:08.858]  And that's what Vegas is saying.
[01:40:08.878 --> 01:40:19.328]  They're saying that if you, they've been always right in the past, could get the nomination, you would beat her because you're anti-war and you're pro-Second Amendment and you're pro-control the borders.
[01:40:19.728 --> 01:40:23.011]  You've got the liberals and conservatives and libertarians supporting you.
[01:40:23.291 --> 01:40:29.317]  Why wouldn't any Republican get behind you knowing that only Ron Paul can beat Hillary Clinton?
[01:40:29.697 --> 01:40:34.118]  You know, you wonder about that because now the move is right now is to try to close the primaries.
[01:40:34.258 --> 01:40:38.940]  Do you think they're sincere when they say they want to have a big tent and invite new people in?
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:45.962]  They can invite a lot of new people in, but they don't want constitutionalists evidently because they want to make it tough to vote in a Republican primary.
[01:40:46.302 --> 01:40:47.522]  So that doesn't add up.
[01:40:47.943 --> 01:40:56.605]  It just sort of confirms the fact that, you know, the control of this whole system has been one party, so to speak.
[01:40:56.625 --> 01:40:58.926]  You know, it's one group of people who have controlled both parties.
[01:40:59.426 --> 01:41:02.888]  And right now, I think the people are getting disgusted with it, and they're starting to wake up.
[01:41:03.288 --> 01:41:05.589]  Congressman, do you think that they're accelerating?
[01:41:05.609 --> 01:41:15.095]  Again, we're talking to Congressman Ron Paul, running for president and gaining steam to get the win for the nomination as Republican here and defeat Hillary.
[01:41:16.495 --> 01:41:25.981]  Do you think that they're trying to speed up the primaries and bring them in earlier as an attempt to try to block you and other populist candidates?
[01:41:27.322 --> 01:41:31.103]  I don't think it's just me, because that has been started for a while.
[01:41:31.163 --> 01:41:37.046]  But I think, generally speaking, the two major parties, the leadership, do not want competition.
[01:41:37.086 --> 01:41:43.268]  This is the reason third parties have never survived very well, because it's hard to get on ballots, they won't let you in the debates.
[01:41:43.708 --> 01:41:49.530]  And now, they're speeding this up, so if you're a grassroots-type candidate, they don't want to give you much time to get traction.
[01:41:50.483 --> 01:41:59.371]  But they didn't realize that you can get traction some other way, such as through the internet and grassroots campaigning.
[01:41:59.471 --> 01:42:03.835]  So I think that's a bit of a secret weapon that's interfering with their plans.
[01:42:04.375 --> 01:42:07.938]  RonPaul2008.com or 1-800-RON-PAUL.
[01:42:07.978 --> 01:42:08.719]  Call and donate.
[01:42:09.059 --> 01:42:13.823]  Call and get yard signs and bumper stickers at the bare minimum, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:13.843 --> 01:42:16.646]  And if you've already got yard signs like I do and my business does,
[01:42:17.346 --> 01:42:20.869]  You need to get them and give them to your neighbors or give them to that Ron Paul supporter.
[01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:24.112]  If they're lazy and haven't taken action, take the initiative for them.
[01:42:24.452 --> 01:42:28.555]  RonPaul2008.com or 1-800-RON-PAUL.
[01:42:29.376 --> 01:42:35.921]  Congressman, do you think the Republican Party is starting to panic because they have been intensifying their attacks on you?
[01:42:35.941 --> 01:42:37.843]  Do you think they're starting to get concerned?
[01:42:37.863 --> 01:42:44.788]  They're also trying to change their rhetoric a little bit more, it seems, towards a more constitutionalist, freedom-based
[01:42:45.916 --> 01:42:47.857]  Yeah, I think they've already adapted.
[01:42:47.897 --> 01:42:56.603]  I don't know whether they've panicked, but I think they're at least showing some concern, where at first, you know, it was totally ignoring what we were doing.
[01:42:57.283 --> 01:43:00.505]  And then, of course, they made fun of it.
[01:43:01.565 --> 01:43:08.850]  And now I think the challenges are much tougher, and I think we can expect it to get much rougher as time goes on.
[01:43:10.118 --> 01:43:19.287]  Only time is going to tell, but I think we should all be thankful that the ideas of liberty are alive and well in this country, much more so than I ever dreamed, so I'm very pleased.
[01:43:19.728 --> 01:43:27.296]  I want to spend the six minutes we've got left with you, and I want you to know, Congressman, I know how tiring it is to do five, six, seven, eight interviews a day.
[01:43:27.316 --> 01:43:32.021]  I have no idea how hard it is to do the things you're doing, and at 72, good thing you're in such good shape.
[01:43:32.621 --> 01:43:37.385]  So I appreciate the time, and I know the listeners do, and we thank you because we are your base here, as you know.
[01:43:37.885 --> 01:43:42.188]  The economy, I mean, it's like you're a prophet, but you've been saying this for 25 years.
[01:43:43.048 --> 01:43:45.270]  Now everything you've talked about is coming home to roost.
[01:43:45.630 --> 01:43:54.196]  The dollar plunging in value, the Federal Reserve making announcements that the dollar is going to go down, knowing it would drive it down further.
[01:43:54.216 --> 01:43:59.660]  A, does that help your campaign that everything you've talked about, the hidden inflation tax, is now becoming
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:01.441]  That's the second question.
[01:44:12.825 --> 01:44:14.547]  Yeah, I think it's going to help a whole lot.
[01:44:14.687 --> 01:44:22.994]  Like you say, I've been talking about that for a long time and I think it's so important because the monetary issue is pervasive.
[01:44:23.015 --> 01:44:31.422]  It involves every single transaction we have, you know, whether it's pricing of labor or pricing of goods and services, that's how key it is.
[01:44:31.462 --> 01:44:35.246]  Then when people understand how the Fed screws up the economy and causes all the
[01:44:35.766 --> 01:44:42.571]  I'm getting a lot more calls, even on the business stations, and that of course will be the most challenging.
[01:44:52.058 --> 01:45:04.742]  Once they know the American people have awakened to the con game that's been going on, I think those who run the banking and monetary system aren't going to be too happy, nor will the people who benefit.
[01:45:04.762 --> 01:45:11.744]  You know, the people in the military-industrial complex and now in the medical-industrial complex, they get to use that money first.
[01:45:11.784 --> 01:45:14.165]  They depend on this deficit financing.
[01:45:14.625 --> 01:45:20.787]  So I suspect that we're going to be talking a lot more about this, because although the dollar's down sharply right now,
[01:45:21.371 --> 01:45:31.860]  The secondary effects of rising interest rates and also the cost of living going down here, that's yet to come, so in the next 12 months I think things are going to get a lot worse.
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:33.221]  That was my next question.
[01:45:35.169 --> 01:45:44.595]  Most of the experts who are in the constitutional line of thinking, or the von Mises of you, are saying middle of next year is when the really bad numbers and the debt really starts piling up.
[01:45:44.615 --> 01:45:45.275]  What do you see happening?
[01:45:45.295 --> 01:45:46.175]  You say 12 months?
[01:45:46.576 --> 01:45:54.840]  Well, and that's one thing that Austrian economics teaches is that you shouldn't be so bold as to say in three months this is going to happen because I made a calculation.
[01:45:55.261 --> 01:45:57.402]  Because there's a human element involved.
[01:45:57.782 --> 01:46:06.429]  There are very many objective facts, like when you print money the value goes down, but that doesn't mean that exactly tomorrow the people will know the value of the money is down.
[01:46:06.489 --> 01:46:14.815]  It takes time, and people panic, and there's emotions involved, and we don't know what kind of international event that might precipitate a crisis.
[01:46:14.855 --> 01:46:22.861]  You know, if Bush is foolish enough to go and start bombing Iran, that might precipitate such a crisis as oil going to $200 a barrel.
[01:46:24.322 --> 01:46:26.945]  Well, we've already seen a massive decline in value.
[01:46:26.965 --> 01:46:28.446]  I mean, there is the prediction come true there.
[01:46:28.486 --> 01:46:30.708]  How far, just in general gauging, do you think it's going to go down?
[01:46:50.754 --> 01:46:55.038]  Well, that's hard to say because it depends on what the reaction is.
[01:46:55.338 --> 01:46:57.820]  If they continue to do exactly what we're doing, it's going to go to zero.
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:46:59.762]  We're going to have runaway inflation.
[01:47:00.162 --> 01:47:03.125]  All paper currencies eventually self-destruct and they're ruined.
[01:47:03.725 --> 01:47:06.128]  And we're in uncharted waters right now.
[01:47:06.148 --> 01:47:12.453]  This is the first time in the history of man that you've had no solid currencies around the world.
[01:47:12.513 --> 01:47:14.455]  And this has been going on for 35 years.
[01:47:15.115 --> 01:47:17.778]  So we don't know how this is going to play out.
[01:47:18.695 --> 01:47:29.805]  But in the past, most governments usually had to stop, start over again, develop a new currency, put some trust behind it, put some backing to the currency, and start over.
[01:47:29.825 --> 01:47:39.194]  In this case, it's going to be more difficult, because it's going to be a worldwide crisis, and that's why people who own things are going to be better off than those people who own dollars.
[01:47:39.534 --> 01:47:43.157]  Well, Joseph Stiglitz, Chief Economist, World Bank, said the same thing as you're saying last year.
[01:47:43.177 --> 01:47:46.440]  And he said, we're going to have a global depression unless they change things.
[01:47:46.861 --> 01:47:47.922]  And I said, well, are they changing?
[01:47:47.962 --> 01:47:49.723]  He said, no, they're accelerating.
[01:47:50.124 --> 01:47:51.705]  And that's what I see now.
[01:47:52.046 --> 01:47:58.151]  The establishment really seems to think they can just set up a police state and then let everybody know they've been robbed.
[01:47:58.431 --> 01:48:00.994]  And then if anybody complains, they'll just shoot us in the streets.
[01:48:01.654 --> 01:48:05.355]  Well, hopefully it doesn't get that bad, but they're going to use the fear factor.
[01:48:05.395 --> 01:48:10.756]  You know, look at what they do about the fear of these third world nations going to bomb us and we have to invade them.
[01:48:10.776 --> 01:48:14.517]  The fear of another 9-11 attack, so therefore you give up all your civil liberties.
[01:48:14.817 --> 01:48:16.297]  And they do that in economics, too.
[01:48:16.597 --> 01:48:19.298]  There's this tremendous fear and a breakdown.
[01:48:19.338 --> 01:48:20.398]  They're not going to admit the truth.
[01:48:20.418 --> 01:48:22.299]  They're going to say, you know, markets don't work.
[01:48:22.339 --> 01:48:24.339]  What we need is somebody to take care of us.
[01:48:25.039 --> 01:48:29.123]  And what we have to fight for is to make sure that people won't give up their liberties.
[01:48:29.624 --> 01:48:30.164]  Exactly.
[01:48:30.264 --> 01:48:36.630]  So you're saying they could use the financial crisis, then pose as saviors and give us even more government as a fix.
[01:48:36.891 --> 01:48:37.751]  Oh, I think they will.
[01:48:37.771 --> 01:48:38.212]  They've done that.
[01:48:38.252 --> 01:48:41.375]  Look, it's really started wholesale, you know, in the Depression.
[01:48:41.415 --> 01:48:42.296]  That was the whole thing.
[01:48:42.316 --> 01:48:45.579]  You know, scare people to death instead of blaming the Federal Reserve for the Depression.
[01:48:46.259 --> 01:48:47.420]  We're good to go.
[01:49:09.213 --> 01:49:18.397]  Well, according to him, it's not a lie, and according to the way they measure it, they don't think it's a lie, but according to the facts, it's a lie, because they're, of course, inflating the money supply.
[01:49:18.417 --> 01:49:27.040]  They won't even tell us they're inflating the currency by 13% if you look at M3, and even the price inflation, which is not the actual inflation.
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:33.283]  If you go by the old CPI, it's going up 8 or 10%, so he's certainly deceiving us.
[01:49:34.131 --> 01:49:35.552]  Congressman, we salute you.
[01:49:35.592 --> 01:49:37.653]  We pray for you and Carol and your whole family.
[01:49:37.753 --> 01:49:38.453]  God bless you.
[01:49:38.493 --> 01:49:39.094]  Go with God.
[01:49:39.374 --> 01:49:39.774]  Thanks a lot.
[01:49:40.154 --> 01:49:40.515]  Thank you.
[01:49:41.395 --> 01:49:41.775]  All right.
[01:49:41.855 --> 01:49:45.077]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:45.657 --> 01:49:46.518]  Stay with us.
[01:49:56.434 --> 01:50:01.920]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.281 --> 01:50:09.889]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:17.663]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.063 --> 01:50:29.448]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.788 --> 01:50:33.350]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.710 --> 01:50:35.691]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.031 --> 01:50:39.873]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:52.992 --> 01:50:58.073]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:58.133 --> 01:51:05.455]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:05.595 --> 01:51:16.257]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:16.437 --> 01:51:20.978]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:21.258 --> 01:51:26.243]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:51:26.463 --> 01:51:29.405]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:29.626 --> 01:51:39.394]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:51:52.896 --> 01:51:58.383]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:51:58.824 --> 01:52:03.049]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:52:03.469 --> 01:52:10.338]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:52:10.778 --> 01:52:17.465]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:52:17.806 --> 01:52:19.408]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:52:19.708 --> 01:52:22.891]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:52:23.172 --> 01:52:24.373]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:52:24.633 --> 01:52:25.634]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:52:25.935 --> 01:52:27.076]  BioSolutions has over 550
[01:52:28.137 --> 01:52:28.657]  We're good to go.
[01:52:54.114 --> 01:52:56.856]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:52:56.876 --> 01:53:00.777]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:05.819 --> 01:53:10.981]  Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, which I will admit I liked listening to when I was in high school.
[01:53:11.001 --> 01:53:19.725]  Can you imagine what a crazy person I looked like with a big black Stetson and a Megadeth t-shirt cut off?
[01:53:20.706 --> 01:53:21.566]  And stilt-toe boots?
[01:53:23.425 --> 01:53:37.809]  Anyways, he's going to be joining us, and the reason he's joining us, coming up in about 35 minutes, is because he has got a new album out, and the whole thing is absolutely dead-on anti-New World Order.
[01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:47.232]  And I remember, being about 15, while we were driving around doing donuts in fields in the middle of nowhere, like a bunch of heathen,
[01:53:48.437 --> 01:54:11.828]  Listen to the Megadeth lyrics and it wasn't like other heavy metal stuff devil this devil that wasn't about that It was about evil world government evil New World Order I guess it was kind of subliminally telling me it was evil Back before I even woke up a few years later to the New World Order I remember getting the lyrics out of the out of the CD case CDs had just come out and then in reading, you know so so this this new one and
[01:54:13.819 --> 01:54:14.179]  I think so.
[01:54:37.026 --> 01:54:47.489]  He yells at me or whatever when he's coming up in 35 minutes or even pops on the show, but reportedly he knows about the show, knows of the show, and he's on the road right now, so we'll see if he's there.
[01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:54.171]  It turned out Ron Paul thought he was on earlier today than he was, but that's how it always is with these guys that are really busy.
[01:54:54.511 --> 01:54:56.432]  Frankly, it's the same way getting me on a radio show now.
[01:54:56.452 --> 01:54:57.172]  It gets harder and harder.
[01:54:57.192 --> 01:55:01.293]  You just get burnout, you get tired, you get radio interviews piling up until Kingdom come.
[01:55:01.593 --> 01:55:03.173]  I'm not like Ron Paul and Dave Mustaine.
[01:55:03.213 --> 01:55:04.834]  I've just stopped doing them, most of them.
[01:55:05.469 --> 01:55:14.236]  Because I can't do all the other work I'm doing and do this, but there's a bunch of news I haven't even covered yet today.
[01:55:14.256 --> 01:55:18.900]  I'm going to do that in the next 30 minutes and take some of your phone calls on the Browns, on the U.S.S.
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:20.842]  Liberty, on the things Ron Paul just said, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:55:20.862 --> 01:55:22.764]  But before I go any further, I want to tell you about
[01:55:32.322 --> 01:55:33.804]  Inner food, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:33.864 --> 01:55:36.326]  Inner food is the best green food out there I've found.
[01:55:36.747 --> 01:55:37.648]  And it tastes the best.
[01:55:37.708 --> 01:55:38.689]  It doesn't give me a headache.
[01:55:39.730 --> 01:55:46.898]  Some of the other speed type herbs they put in other green foods that they say are really good to eat, give me a headache.
[01:55:46.938 --> 01:55:48.439]  This doesn't have stimulants in it.
[01:55:49.140 --> 01:55:50.321]  And some of you may not like that.
[01:55:50.441 --> 01:55:51.603]  I like it not having stimulants.
[01:55:51.663 --> 01:55:53.725]  I get plenty of stimulants in my coffee, thank you.
[01:55:54.449 --> 01:55:54.690]  I think.
[01:56:07.416 --> 01:56:13.260]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com and you can go to the banner on the right hand side to EnterFood.com.
[01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:16.762]  When you go to that sub-page you get 10% off the Alex Jones sub-page.
[01:56:17.422 --> 01:56:21.925]  E-N-E-R-Food.com or go to PrisonPlanet.com and click on that or 866-762-9238.
[01:56:25.023 --> 01:56:34.927]  Improved liver function, healthy blood sugar, immune system support, improved digestion, detoxing effects, balanced energy all day long, greater stamina, weight loss, 20 power-packed ingredients, greater mental clarity.
[01:56:35.447 --> 01:56:45.871]  It's the extract, the essence of 20 fruits and vegetables and a few herbs, and kelp and barley grass and chlorella, spirulina, all that good stuff.
[01:56:46.611 --> 01:56:50.753]  So again, and yeah, that algae, those little diatoms are good for you folks.
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:53.681]  1-866-762-9238.
[01:56:54.261 --> 01:56:56.661]  A lavish plug for Interfood because they're good guys.
[01:56:57.502 --> 01:57:01.923]  And another fabulous sponsor I cannot say enough about is efoodsdirect.com.
[01:57:02.243 --> 01:57:04.144]  That's the website for the J. Michael Stevens Group.
[01:57:04.464 --> 01:57:05.304]  They have a show.
[01:57:06.524 --> 01:57:07.264]  It's excellent.
[01:57:07.805 --> 01:57:10.865]  Right after my show ends, Sunday nights on this network at 6 p.m.
[01:57:10.905 --> 01:57:12.406]  Central, 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:57:12.446 --> 01:57:14.186]  Central and on WWCR.
[01:57:14.726 --> 01:57:16.247]  They have their preparedness show.
[01:57:17.168 --> 01:57:17.869]  Give them a call.
[01:57:17.889 --> 01:57:19.830]  Get a free catalog.
[01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:21.031]  Call and get a two-month supply.
[01:57:21.091 --> 01:57:21.891]  Your supply of food.
[01:57:22.071 --> 01:57:22.592]  Get ready.
[01:57:22.972 --> 01:57:29.556]  If you don't store food, well, you're like folks who didn't buy gold when it was 300 an ounce.
[01:57:29.576 --> 01:57:32.098]  1-800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:57:33.358 --> 01:57:37.941]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.429 --> 01:57:53.630]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.271 --> 01:57:55.091]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.851 --> 01:57:56.731]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.412 --> 01:58:01.073]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.593 --> 01:58:05.715]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.606 --> 01:58:18.449]  I'm not even going to tell you the stack of important news I have.
[01:58:18.870 --> 01:58:20.031]  I'll just mention some of it.
[01:58:20.051 --> 01:58:21.092]  It's all up on the website.
[01:58:21.132 --> 01:58:22.514]  It's coming up here in about 15 minutes.
[01:58:22.534 --> 01:58:29.301]  Some of you are scheduled to have the lead singer, the founder, the songwriter, the head honcho at Megadeth.
[01:58:29.962 --> 01:58:32.164]  He was also, of course, with Metallica in their first days.
[01:58:32.985 --> 01:58:36.649]  Dave Mustaine popping in, because he's total anti-New World Order now.
[01:58:37.378 --> 01:58:39.779]  We'll get his take on all of it.
[01:58:39.859 --> 01:58:42.099]  Huge interview earlier with Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:58:42.599 --> 01:58:45.740]  I want to comment on some of the things he said there, too, before this hour ends.
[01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:49.861]  And, of course, the Browns have been grabbed with people posing as patriots around them.
[01:58:50.041 --> 01:58:51.782]  That wasn't hard to guess that was going to happen.
[01:58:51.822 --> 01:58:52.382]  I predicted it.
[01:58:52.842 --> 01:58:54.822]  That was like predicting the sun will come up tomorrow, though.
[01:58:54.843 --> 01:58:56.563]  Again, not a very hard prediction.
[01:58:57.487 --> 01:59:00.329]  And we also had huge revelations on the U.S.'
[01:59:00.289 --> 01:59:01.909]  's liberty in the first and second hour.
[01:59:02.410 --> 01:59:03.630]  Huge revelations.
[01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:07.092]  That'll all start retransmitting by the way when the show ends in one hour.
[01:59:07.842 --> 01:59:20.067]  If you missed any of it on your local AM or FM dial, wonderful folks, or on the global shortwave, or on the internet, you can just go to InfoWars.com to MyStreams, where I restream the show 21 hours a day after the live show.
[01:59:20.087 --> 01:59:24.268]  In this case, it'll be for two days until I'm back live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:59:24.369 --> 01:59:24.989]  Central.
[01:59:25.849 --> 01:59:29.170]  Let's go ahead and talk to Adam in Minnesota, then Doug and others.
[01:59:29.310 --> 01:59:30.351]  Adam, you're on the air.
[01:59:30.925 --> 01:59:31.946]  Yeah, hey, how you doing?
[01:59:32.066 --> 01:59:32.386]  Good!
[01:59:32.826 --> 01:59:34.067]  Yeah, hey, I love your show, man.
[01:59:34.087 --> 01:59:35.729]  I'm glad I came across you.
[01:59:35.749 --> 01:59:39.752]  I first discovered you about three years ago, and it's been a wake-up for me.
[01:59:40.092 --> 01:59:41.113]  Well, I love the show, too.
[01:59:41.153 --> 01:59:41.813]  It's a humdinger.
[01:59:41.853 --> 01:59:45.056]  We have the USS Liberty revelations, the declassified U.S.
[01:59:45.076 --> 01:59:47.738]  government interceptions, the Israelis knowing it was a U.S.
[01:59:47.778 --> 01:59:55.083]  ship, Ron Paul dropping bombshell after bombshell, and the Brown revelations, and the Mustang, if he shows up in 30 minutes.
[01:59:56.593 --> 02:00:05.439]  Well, on Dave Mustaine, I find it amazing that you have him on, because like you, I grew up listening to him, and I always kind of knew there was something different about him.
[02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:07.541]  It wasn't devil, devil, devil, yeah.
[02:00:07.701 --> 02:00:12.384]  Yeah, he had something more substance to what he was singing, but it's interesting.
[02:00:12.405 --> 02:00:18.489]  A year and a half ago, I wrote an article for the American Chronicle, an online magazine, and it got published.
[02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:21.251]  The name of the article is Dependent on Lies.
[02:00:22.085 --> 02:00:24.206]  And I open it quoting Dave Mustaine.
[02:00:24.326 --> 02:00:25.687]  He has a line from a song.
[02:00:26.007 --> 02:00:26.868]  The song is Trust.
[02:00:27.568 --> 02:00:30.349]  It says, uh, we lie to each other so much that nothing we trust.
[02:00:31.450 --> 02:00:34.912]  And I, I extrapolated on that and said, you know, that's like our society, man.
[02:00:34.932 --> 02:00:39.334]  We've been lying to one another so much that we don't know what to trust in anymore.
[02:00:40.355 --> 02:00:43.516]  And I just thought, you know, it's phenomenal that you have Dave Mustaine on and, uh, you know.
[02:00:44.617 --> 02:00:48.179]  Well, see, I don't count my chickens until they're hatched.
[02:00:48.888 --> 02:00:52.031]  Because he's on the road, but he'll definitely end up being on today, if not Monday.
[02:00:52.051 --> 02:00:53.293]  I mean, it's all confirmed.
[02:00:53.313 --> 02:01:00.240]  We just talked to his people again, but, you know, you talk to some bug-eyed roadie or something wrong, but we'll see if he's on in 25 minutes.
[02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:01.401]  We wait, don't we?
[02:01:02.341 --> 02:01:08.943]  Yeah, well, I look forward to hearing what he's got to say and it's nice to know that the tide is turning and, you know, so many people are waking up to the New World Order.
[02:01:08.963 --> 02:01:09.924]  Well, I want to be clear though.
[02:01:09.984 --> 02:01:10.984]  He didn't wake up now.
[02:01:11.004 --> 02:01:11.564]  Yeah.
[02:01:11.624 --> 02:01:16.646]  I remember reading the lyrics and I started thinking maybe this is what woke me up and my dad knew about it but he never pushed it on me.
[02:01:17.106 --> 02:01:18.667]  I mean, I was like 14 years old.
[02:01:18.687 --> 02:01:25.229]  I remember reading the lyrics about the UN and world government and staged wars and how they want to kill everybody.
[02:01:25.249 --> 02:01:27.550]  I mean, Dave Mustaine, he writes those songs.
[02:01:27.610 --> 02:01:29.131]  I guess he just knew it all then.
[02:01:30.091 --> 02:01:30.752]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:01:31.252 --> 02:01:42.661]  Well, I guess what is more important is the fact that being that upfront, knowing that he has that large of a fan base, it's going to just bring that many more people, you know, into the awareness of what's happening.
[02:01:43.561 --> 02:01:46.363]  Well, I've got the new album right here, the new CD.
[02:01:46.483 --> 02:01:50.166]  It's excellent for those that like that type of music.
[02:01:50.747 --> 02:01:57.692]  But before he gets on, I wanted to read through some of his lyrics here.
[02:01:58.556 --> 02:02:00.137]  Because it's amazing.
[02:02:00.177 --> 02:02:06.540]  But the new one is United Abominations.
[02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:15.025]  And it shows the United Nations on fire, blowing up, and basically the Antichrist on the cover.
[02:02:16.186 --> 02:02:16.486]  Yeah.
[02:02:16.686 --> 02:02:18.587]  So, it's pretty powerful.
[02:02:18.987 --> 02:02:20.108]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[02:02:20.128 --> 02:02:20.768]  Good to hear from you.
[02:02:21.368 --> 02:02:23.129]  Doug and others, your calls are straight ahead.
[02:02:23.529 --> 02:02:26.231]  By the way, we're going to play a little bit of a Megadeth song here in a minute.
[02:02:26.983 --> 02:02:31.505]  For people that don't like this music, you can just stick wax in your ears or something.
[02:02:32.226 --> 02:02:34.947]  Alright, this is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:02:35.567 --> 02:02:36.468]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:02:36.508 --> 02:02:38.729]  We're here Monday through Friday, live 11 to 2.
[02:02:39.169 --> 02:02:41.490]  Back from 9 to midnight on the network and on the shortwave.
[02:02:42.011 --> 02:02:44.072]  And 24 hours a day at InfoWars.com.
[02:02:45.052 --> 02:02:50.135]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:02:50.215 --> 02:02:57.518]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:02:57.678 --> 02:03:08.324]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:03:08.504 --> 02:03:13.026]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:03:13.326 --> 02:03:18.308]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:03:18.528 --> 02:03:21.470]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:03:21.690 --> 02:03:31.354]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black murky elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[02:03:32.634 --> 02:03:39.016]  It's here!
[02:03:39.156 --> 02:03:53.358]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:53.718 --> 02:04:01.320]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.051 --> 02:04:09.095]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.495 --> 02:04:20.921]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.241 --> 02:04:24.783]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.164 --> 02:04:27.145]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.465 --> 02:04:31.327]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[02:04:31.887 --> 02:04:39.233]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:04:44.913 --> 02:04:49.177]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:04:49.437 --> 02:04:54.341]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:04:54.542 --> 02:04:55.883]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:04:56.043 --> 02:04:59.446]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calvin Pure Soaps?

[02:05:10.896 --> 02:05:11.136]  Yes!
[02:05:11.156 --> 02:05:13.578]  Now, CalBin soaps are available to you and me.

[02:05:19.822 --> 02:05:20.763]  No animal testing.
[02:05:21.023 --> 02:05:22.344]  I use them and love them.
[02:05:22.364 --> 02:05:23.945]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:05:24.245 --> 02:05:25.406]  And I save big time.

[02:05:37.114 --> 02:05:39.136]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:06:00.319 --> 02:06:00.980]  We're good to go.
[02:06:24.392 --> 02:06:24.974]  We're good.
[02:06:57.472 --> 02:06:59.574]  We're good to go.
[02:07:25.962 --> 02:07:26.482]  Alright.
[02:07:26.522 --> 02:07:31.644]  That's a little bit of, uh...
[02:07:48.667 --> 02:07:50.668]  United Abominations.
[02:07:51.748 --> 02:07:55.810]  And again, back when I was a teenager, I remember the lyrics.
[02:07:55.850 --> 02:07:58.551]  It was always anti-UN, anti-New World Order.
[02:07:59.831 --> 02:08:04.113]  So I just want to ask him how he came to so many years ago.
[02:08:04.133 --> 02:08:10.275]  I mean, now you've got a lot of people from pop music to country to you name it singing about this type of stuff.
[02:08:11.477 --> 02:08:19.624]  And I always wondered where Metallica's influences are, because they've got some songs that are anti-New World Order and anti-corrupt corpse systems in some of their music.
[02:08:19.664 --> 02:08:21.646]  I mean, did that come from Dave Mustaine?
[02:08:22.046 --> 02:08:22.466]  We'll see.
[02:08:22.847 --> 02:08:23.887]  Or does he see the whole picture?
[02:08:23.907 --> 02:08:26.970]  Does he only see part of the picture?
[02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:29.292]  But he talks about UN sex crimes.
[02:08:30.533 --> 02:08:36.558]  He talks about all the criminal things that they're involved in, and like every song,
[02:08:40.223 --> 02:08:45.226]  In here, in this new album, is on similar subject.
[02:08:45.686 --> 02:08:48.308]  It says, ethnic cleansing with no defending.
[02:08:49.528 --> 02:08:54.972]  These acts of genocide, a fatal ending with no surrendering to cover up the crimes and lie.
[02:08:55.452 --> 02:09:02.516]  Smart bombs, precision guided armament, a more sophisticated way to end up dead, still we search.
[02:09:04.398 --> 02:09:09.781]  And invent such intelligent weapons that kill each other, like the Gears of War.
[02:09:09.841 --> 02:09:10.322]  Hoorah!
[02:09:11.943 --> 02:09:12.743]  And it just goes on.
[02:09:12.763 --> 02:09:16.065]  Let's talk about the United Nations.
[02:09:17.246 --> 02:09:17.846]  So that's coming up.
[02:09:17.866 --> 02:09:18.646]  We'll see how that goes.
[02:09:18.727 --> 02:09:23.709]  I've got a lot of other news here, and a lot of phone calls, obviously, that we need to go to.
[02:09:24.810 --> 02:09:27.332]  Let's talk to Doug in Tennessee, then Rita and others.
[02:09:27.372 --> 02:09:27.992]  Go ahead, Doug.
[02:09:28.012 --> 02:09:31.114]  Sir, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[02:09:32.401 --> 02:09:33.422]  It's a pleasure to talk to you.
[02:09:33.442 --> 02:09:34.102]  What's on your mind?
[02:09:34.343 --> 02:09:35.864]  Well, I had a couple things, Alex.
[02:09:36.044 --> 02:09:39.207]  First of all, I want everyone to know about H.R.
[02:09:39.227 --> 02:09:39.207]  811.
[02:09:39.447 --> 02:09:47.294]  It's a bill that has 216 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives, and it requires a paper trail in federal elections.
[02:09:48.074 --> 02:09:52.038]  This is a vital bill, and I urge everyone to contact their local congressman.
[02:09:52.917 --> 02:09:59.760]  My understanding is that there had been a vote scheduled and it had been postponed.
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:16.386]  I can't really get a straight answer from Pelosi's office or Steny Hoyer's office as to why the vote has been postponed, but people need to call them and demand an up or down vote on this to have a paper trail in federal elections.
[02:10:16.506 --> 02:10:17.846]  That's HR 811.
[02:10:19.107 --> 02:10:22.408]  And I also wanted to say, Alex, that my wife and I are
[02:10:23.021 --> 02:10:25.284]  Deeply involved in the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:10:25.345 --> 02:10:35.740]  We've discovered that here in Knoxville, with the other UT, the University of Tennessee, has what they call a free speech zone.
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:36.942]  Terrible phrase, but
[02:10:37.682 --> 02:10:41.984]  Nevertheless, we've taken advantage of the University of Tennessee.
[02:10:42.105 --> 02:10:44.946]  Yeah, the whole university is a free-speak zone.
[02:10:45.206 --> 02:10:45.606]  That's right.
[02:10:45.627 --> 02:10:46.887]  And that's the way they've always been.
[02:10:46.907 --> 02:10:50.609]  And now they say, no, there's a place down behind campus where nobody can see you.
[02:10:50.749 --> 02:10:55.152]  Or at first it's a good place, the next year it'll be a bad place, the next year it'll be off campus.
[02:10:55.412 --> 02:10:56.953]  You can't put up with those free-speak zones.
[02:10:57.473 --> 02:11:04.998]  Well, at the University of Tennessee, they have a real good one because it's right at the library entrance leading into a greenway.
[02:11:05.018 --> 02:11:07.960]  I know, but see, they do that at first, then they move it to a bad place.
[02:11:08.020 --> 02:11:09.661]  I mean, I'm not debating you on that.
[02:11:09.701 --> 02:11:10.442]  I know you agree.
[02:11:10.702 --> 02:11:11.923]  I'm just saying that's how they work.
[02:11:12.303 --> 02:11:14.104]  Yeah, well, you're right.
[02:11:14.144 --> 02:11:17.507]  The whole nation is a free speech zone, and we need to assert our rights.
[02:11:17.947 --> 02:11:20.349]  We've set up our 9-11 truth table there.
[02:11:20.389 --> 02:11:23.711]  We've handed out hundreds of DVDs and fact sheets to people.
[02:11:24.412 --> 02:11:31.296]  We also, just two days ago, we set up at the Great Smoky Mountain National Park, the main visitor center there.
[02:11:32.017 --> 02:11:36.739]  And I just want people to know that people are hungry for this information.
[02:11:36.859 --> 02:11:40.101]  People who you wouldn't expect came up to our table.
[02:11:40.161 --> 02:11:47.085]  People who are of all ages, all socioeconomic groups, hungry for this information.
[02:11:48.536 --> 02:11:58.944]  We have a DVD duplicator and we can crank out about 10 DVDs an hour and we gave out over 100 DVDs in just about 6 hours.
[02:11:58.984 --> 02:12:00.185]  Well good job my friend.
[02:12:00.245 --> 02:12:00.706]  Keep it up.
[02:12:00.786 --> 02:12:01.847]  I appreciate your call.
[02:12:02.227 --> 02:12:03.708]  Let's talk to Rita in Texas.
[02:12:03.768 --> 02:12:04.609]  Rita, you're on the air.
[02:12:07.231 --> 02:12:07.571]  Hello.
[02:12:08.792 --> 02:12:10.874]  Hi, this is Rita Jones and I'm a songwriter.
[02:12:11.454 --> 02:12:12.255]  Hey Rita, how you doing?
[02:12:12.620 --> 02:12:13.060]  I'm fine.
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:17.263]  I wrote so long Texas Hello Mexico that I understand you're playing and I appreciate that.
[02:12:17.483 --> 02:12:17.843]  You bet.
[02:12:17.883 --> 02:12:20.124]  We play little bits and pieces of that.
[02:12:20.164 --> 02:12:21.065]  Thank you for writing it.
[02:12:21.225 --> 02:12:22.325]  Well, I appreciate that.
[02:12:22.425 --> 02:12:28.248]  I just wanted to let you know that we have a CD called Life's Too Short Not to Live in Texas by Johnny Tex and the Texicans.
[02:12:29.209 --> 02:12:31.990]  And we have a Trans-Texas Quarter Blues.
[02:12:32.090 --> 02:12:38.834]  We have There Ain't No Green in My Flag, Son, which deals basically with what happened in Reno when the guy took the flag down.
[02:12:38.854 --> 02:12:40.395]  I wrote
[02:12:41.485 --> 02:12:45.649]  Ron Paul's campaign song, Vote Yes for Dr. No.
[02:12:45.930 --> 02:12:47.672]  We just got a lot of good things going on.
[02:12:47.912 --> 02:12:51.536]  Our website is www.johnnytex.com.
[02:12:52.677 --> 02:12:54.339]  We just wanted to thank you for applying us.
[02:12:54.599 --> 02:12:56.321]  It means a lot to us.
[02:12:56.829 --> 02:12:57.529]  Well thank you!
[02:12:57.649 --> 02:13:02.792]  No, months and months ago we heard that song and then Lou Dobbs picked it up and I know he's been playing it.
[02:13:03.192 --> 02:13:05.493]  And I think when we first got it we mentioned who'd done it.
[02:13:06.854 --> 02:13:08.255]  A month later I hear it playing and I forget.
[02:13:08.295 --> 02:13:10.696]  Yeah, it was Johnny Tex and the Texicans, right?
[02:13:10.936 --> 02:13:11.256]  Yes sir.
[02:13:11.636 --> 02:13:16.319]  And you guys ought to send me a CD of that and if it's okay I'll play more clips.
[02:13:16.339 --> 02:13:17.159]  I certainly will!
[02:13:17.599 --> 02:13:18.219]  Where do I send it?
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:21.121]  I didn't know that there was a whole CD of it.
[02:13:21.161 --> 02:13:22.502]  Maybe I'll even carry it or something.
[02:13:22.702 --> 02:13:23.502]  Oh that's great!
[02:13:23.562 --> 02:13:24.262]  We love that!
[02:13:24.703 --> 02:13:25.303]  Where do I send it?
[02:13:26.057 --> 02:13:35.063]  There's an address on InfoWars.com if you forget it, but it's 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:13:35.804 --> 02:13:44.069]  Well I can do that and we just really appreciate you playing us and keep up the good work.
[02:13:44.938 --> 02:13:45.678]  Well, thank you.
[02:13:45.758 --> 02:13:51.380]  No, I mean, it's going to be music, it's going to be films, it's going to be all of us together that are going to defeat this New World Order.
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:52.501]  Plug that website again.
[02:13:53.021 --> 02:13:57.162]  Trans-Texas, www.johnnytex.com.
[02:13:57.202 --> 02:14:04.245]  Trans-Texas Quarter Blues is the bumper song on the credits roll in William H. Molina's
[02:14:06.767 --> 02:14:11.548]  It's an award-winning documentary called Truth Be Told about the transsexual squirter blues.
[02:14:11.988 --> 02:14:12.328]  Oh, good.
[02:14:12.368 --> 02:14:13.649]  I wasn't aware of that film.
[02:14:13.689 --> 02:14:14.929]  I think I've heard of it.
[02:14:14.949 --> 02:14:15.749]  I haven't seen it yet.
[02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.789]  You need to see it.
[02:14:16.849 --> 02:14:17.349]  It's awesome.
[02:14:17.589 --> 02:14:17.810]  I know.
[02:14:17.830 --> 02:14:19.370]  There's a lot of stuff I need to see.
[02:14:19.970 --> 02:14:21.770]  Believe me, I wish I had time to see it all.
[02:14:22.170 --> 02:14:22.471]  Okay.
[02:14:22.491 --> 02:14:24.011]  Well, thank you so much for calling, Rita.
[02:14:25.051 --> 02:14:25.851]  Good to hear from you.
[02:14:26.772 --> 02:14:33.353]  Oh, by the way, I've done two hours and 17 minutes of broadcast today, and I haven't even plugged this yet.
[02:14:34.111 --> 02:14:35.692]  Endgame went on sale last night.
[02:14:36.273 --> 02:14:38.575]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:14:39.035 --> 02:14:39.656]  And we have them.
[02:14:40.376 --> 02:14:47.562]  We have them right here in the office, but I can't ship them out until November 1st via my agreement with the distributor, who's going to put them in stores.
[02:14:47.862 --> 02:14:51.685]  And most stores don't want to be available until, what, November 13th or 14th.
[02:14:52.406 --> 02:14:53.967]  But you put your orders in now.
[02:14:54.047 --> 02:14:54.848]  We'll package them up.
[02:14:54.908 --> 02:14:55.609]  We'll have them ready.
[02:14:55.669 --> 02:14:56.790]  We'll ship them out to you November 1st.
[02:14:57.677 --> 02:14:58.898]  Wink, wink, maybe even earlier.
[02:15:00.138 --> 02:15:10.543]  And you can be able to watch it online at PrisonPlanet.tv or at InGameTheMovie.com or WhatIsTheInGame.com.
[02:15:11.023 --> 02:15:12.444]  Both those URLs will take you there.
[02:15:12.784 --> 02:15:13.765]  Coming up October 26.
[02:15:15.005 --> 02:15:16.286]  October 26.
[02:15:16.866 --> 02:15:18.887]  All our PrisonPlanet.tv members will be able to see it.
[02:15:19.227 --> 02:15:25.190]  And we've upgraded the servers to a content distribution network and another distribution network of servers.
[02:15:26.019 --> 02:15:32.725]  And so the downloads are beautiful, they are fast, they are clean, and I mean it is almost DVD quality, they're so beautiful.
[02:15:33.365 --> 02:15:37.228]  And the film is my greatest work and the most expensive film I've ever made.
[02:15:38.449 --> 02:15:52.000]  So I'm asking everybody out there to take action now and to get your order for End Game in so you'll have it as soon as possible to show to people in your community.
[02:15:52.540 --> 02:15:54.282]  Show it at the library, show it at your church,
[02:15:56.077 --> 02:15:56.938]  Get it out to people.
[02:15:57.278 --> 02:16:00.499]  And you will be authorized to make copies for non-profit educational purposes.
[02:16:01.539 --> 02:16:10.283]  Some people have the nerve to sell my videos online for like a dollar apiece, which would bankrupt me, and then even try to buy ads on Google Video on my site.
[02:16:10.483 --> 02:16:10.703]  No.
[02:16:11.363 --> 02:16:12.703]  We can't let people do that, folks.
[02:16:12.723 --> 02:16:13.484]  You can't do that.
[02:16:14.764 --> 02:16:19.586]  But we want you to make copies of them for non-profit educational purposes.
[02:16:20.941 --> 02:16:25.183]  I mean, in the past, I'd even let people get away with almost anything, and now I can't pay my employees.
[02:16:25.343 --> 02:16:26.184]  I can't operate.
[02:16:27.124 --> 02:16:29.245]  And some months we lose money.
[02:16:31.206 --> 02:16:36.969]  January, February, March, and April, we were in the red at this office, and I don't talk about that on air.
[02:16:36.989 --> 02:16:38.189]  I don't like to talk about that.
[02:16:38.889 --> 02:16:46.153]  That's why I took on some more advertisers, which are great folks, so it's just that if I had my brothers, I'd just talk about news all day.
[02:16:46.173 --> 02:16:48.614]  We wouldn't even have ads for the network, but those are ads for the network.
[02:16:49.786 --> 02:16:52.947]  So that's basically where this broadcast stands right now.
[02:16:54.007 --> 02:17:02.948]  People have this image of me, I don't know why, as I've never put that image out there, as like in some glistening 50-story building walking around in a Brooks Brothers suit, and that is just the opposite.
[02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:15.450]  We're effective because we work very hard, and we reach a lot of people, but that, again, is the model of the Internet and what we've been able to do because of you getting the word out there.
[02:17:16.251 --> 02:17:18.851]  So again, Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:17:19.634 --> 02:17:26.877]  He is now available right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:17:27.517 --> 02:17:28.138]  Can't miss it.
[02:17:28.178 --> 02:17:30.018]  You click right there or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:17:30.158 --> 02:17:30.398]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:17:30.418 --> 02:17:34.180]  Or you can write to us at the address on the website.
[02:17:45.097 --> 02:17:48.118]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:17:48.418 --> 02:17:53.341]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:17:53.601 --> 02:17:57.942]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:17:58.243 --> 02:18:07.166]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:18:07.366 --> 02:18:10.988]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:18:11.288 --> 02:18:16.315]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:18:16.615 --> 02:18:23.345]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:18:23.826 --> 02:18:24.386]  What about you?
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:30.482]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:18:30.522 --> 02:18:31.682]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:18:31.702 --> 02:18:33.583]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:18:44.750 --> 02:18:46.331]  Ted Anders from Midas, October 5th, 2007.
[02:18:46.371 --> 02:18:48.953]  Gold 730 20 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $752.96, $371.30 for half, $165.65 for quarter.
[02:18:48.993 --> 02:18:49.413]  That's $752.96, $371.30, and $185.65.
[02:18:59.463 --> 02:19:05.425]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[02:19:05.485 --> 02:19:09.807]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan Revolution.
[02:19:10.107 --> 02:19:18.570]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[02:19:18.610 --> 02:19:21.191]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[02:19:21.471 --> 02:19:25.333]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[02:19:25.553 --> 02:19:31.956]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[02:19:32.276 --> 02:19:35.798]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[02:19:35.838 --> 02:19:38.979]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in the global game of chess.

[02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:39.580]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:46.412]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.

[02:20:01.113 --> 02:20:08.715]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs, two books that combined are over a thousand pages and other information.

[02:20:16.558 --> 02:20:21.559]  The last word monastery is spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y or call us at 1-800-275-1126.
[02:20:21.579 --> 02:20:21.819]  That's 1-800-275-1126.

[02:20:38.704 --> 02:20:40.325]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[02:20:44.275 --> 02:20:48.837]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:20:49.237 --> 02:20:52.179]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:20:52.499 --> 02:20:55.060]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:20:55.420 --> 02:21:00.242]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:21:00.622 --> 02:21:05.985]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:21:06.305 --> 02:21:09.266]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:21:09.446 --> 02:21:10.006]  We're good to go.
[02:21:32.854 --> 02:21:38.316]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:21:38.336 --> 02:21:38.696]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:21:38.756 --> 02:21:41.957]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[02:21:42.037 --> 02:21:46.798]  There was something so special about that place.
[02:21:47.199 --> 02:21:51.140]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[02:22:02.659 --> 02:22:06.020]  Kevin in Boston, you're on the air, welcome!
[02:22:06.060 --> 02:22:14.161]  Blonte, Alex, thank you for this opportunity to be heard by your patriot audience.
[02:22:14.541 --> 02:22:15.762]  It's an honor.
[02:22:32.209 --> 02:22:42.075]  I was one of the two to four hundred attendees at the 7-14-07 concert at Ed Brown's, and I knew the risks involved, and I got an idea that I think you'll like.
[02:22:43.056 --> 02:22:49.480]  I'd like to ask that the die-hard Patriots listening honor the stand made by the Browns by doing two things.
[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:58.626]  One, by pledging to try to take on the personal sacrifice of making a donation of $240 to the Ron Paul campaign over the next three months.
[02:22:58.726 --> 02:22:59.626]  That's $80 a month or $20 a week.
[02:23:01.454 --> 02:23:04.875]  And it will give Ron Paul his 12 million goal for the fourth quarter.
[02:23:05.736 --> 02:23:14.740]  And the second thing I'd like to ask everybody to do is, the second it's available, get out and get some copies of Endgame and really pump this out.
[02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:17.721]  I just watched the trailer and I'm excited about what you've put together.
[02:23:18.621 --> 02:23:20.242]  And I'm excited about this show today.
[02:23:20.282 --> 02:23:21.202]  Get Ron Paul on.
[02:23:22.083 --> 02:23:25.204]  The Democratic leadership has failed their following.
[02:23:25.644 --> 02:23:26.785]  They're a war party now.
[02:23:27.645 --> 02:23:29.866]  Hillary and Obama are war candidates.
[02:23:30.806 --> 02:23:38.827]  And I've switched parties, and I'm gun host for Ron Paul, and he's the only leadership that's out there that's representing the will of the American people.
[02:23:39.348 --> 02:23:40.548]  Well, God bless you, my friend.
[02:23:40.568 --> 02:23:48.749]  Yeah, it's too bad about the Browns and we'll watch as things develop, but to those that don't know, they got nabbed last night by federal marshals posing as patriots.
[02:23:50.049 --> 02:23:52.250]  Thank you, Alex, and keep up the great work.
[02:23:52.470 --> 02:23:53.790]  Thank you for the call, Kevin.
[02:23:54.510 --> 02:23:55.510]  Scott in Arizona.
[02:23:55.530 --> 02:23:56.131]  You're on the air.
[02:23:56.151 --> 02:23:57.631]  Hey, Alex.
[02:23:57.651 --> 02:23:58.271]  How are you doing, man?
[02:23:58.471 --> 02:23:58.671]  Good.
[02:23:59.867 --> 02:24:06.989]  Hey, we got a lot going on down here, as you can see in the headlines, with the woman in the airport and the dirty bomb that they're going to be setting off.
[02:24:07.009 --> 02:24:11.030]  I was wondering if you could give some insight about what that really is about.
[02:24:12.771 --> 02:24:19.552]  Well, I mean, I don't know that specifically the government's going to shut off a dirty bomb, but I mean, I know they've hyped that up, so they can certainly do that.
[02:24:19.693 --> 02:24:25.934]  They're setting it off next week at the 101 and the 51 in our freeway system down here.
[02:24:26.414 --> 02:24:28.535]  It's not a real dirty bomb, though.
[02:24:29.116 --> 02:24:31.317]  No, I know that, but I'm just wondering what's behind all of this.
[02:24:31.337 --> 02:24:33.157]  You're talking about one of the myriad terror drills?
[02:24:33.458 --> 02:24:40.340]  Well, that's part of psychologically conditioning people, because when they see drills, it has the same effect as that terrorism is real.
[02:24:40.700 --> 02:24:47.582]  So they have to have thousands of drills to convince people psychologically that terrorism is a real threat and not manufactured.
[02:24:49.403 --> 02:24:52.844]  Okay, I just wanted your opinion on that.
[02:24:53.124 --> 02:24:55.025]  And then you wanted my take on something else?
[02:24:56.349 --> 02:24:59.171]  Oh, just, uh, you know, the thing in the airport.
[02:24:59.531 --> 02:25:05.374]  I mean, it sounds like... Well, I mean, clearly, they're trying to show video from a distance of them dragging around, and, you know, they first jump on her and do all that.
[02:25:05.875 --> 02:25:09.957]  She's clearly alive, and then forensics experts have said she couldn't choke herself in her handcuffs.
[02:25:10.638 --> 02:25:16.001]  I've said 90% chance they beat her to death in the cell, and that's what experts on television are saying.
[02:25:16.061 --> 02:25:21.364]  I don't know if that's the case, but 10% chance that magical things happened and Tweety Bird killed her.
[02:25:22.144 --> 02:25:27.426]  But we've learned that she was supposedly going for drug treatment so she could have had a heart attack.
[02:25:27.446 --> 02:25:28.727]  She was old enough for that to happen.
[02:25:29.327 --> 02:25:29.927]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:25:30.948 --> 02:25:34.469]  It just shows that stuff like this didn't used to happen.
[02:25:35.670 --> 02:25:37.130]  And people say, well, it's because of terrorism.
[02:25:37.150 --> 02:25:38.531]  Well, it's because they staged the stuff.
[02:25:39.191 --> 02:25:40.211]  I appreciate your call.
[02:25:40.551 --> 02:25:43.473]  Let me jam one more in here before we end this segment.
[02:25:43.853 --> 02:25:45.233]  Jay in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[02:25:45.734 --> 02:25:46.474]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[02:25:47.955 --> 02:25:54.536]  Hey listen, I'm a college student and I attend a large state university that's near here in Kentucky.
[02:25:55.756 --> 02:26:04.178]  And we have got, we've had a lot of interesting reaction on campus, giving out your videos and DVDs and whatnot.
[02:26:04.418 --> 02:26:06.278]  And we've got a lot of people involved.
[02:26:06.298 --> 02:26:09.539]  We've got a Ron Paul movement on campus going now.
[02:26:09.559 --> 02:26:14.260]  And listen, I wanted to tell you, I came across a book, I'm sure you're aware of it.
[02:26:15.583 --> 02:26:18.525]  It's by Peter Horowitz and David Colliers.
[02:26:18.625 --> 02:26:20.386]  It's a biography of the Rockefellers.
[02:26:20.866 --> 02:26:22.407]  You can get it on Amazon.
[02:26:22.527 --> 02:26:23.347]  It's really cheap.
[02:26:23.928 --> 02:26:24.988]  It's like a couple dollars.
[02:26:25.728 --> 02:26:31.852]  But this book, although it's very lengthy, it's actually a pro-Rockefeller bio, the whole family.
[02:26:33.072 --> 02:26:42.878]  And throughout this book, there's basically an admission of every possible nefarious practice that you would think the Rockefellers are involved in.
[02:26:42.898 --> 02:26:45.059]  But they have excuses for each area.
[02:26:45.655 --> 02:26:49.657]  Yeah, but it's good because, you know, this is not a, you know, conspiracy writer's expert.
[02:26:49.757 --> 02:26:53.498]  No, this is an authorized biography of the family, for the family.
[02:26:53.518 --> 02:26:55.379]  And yes, I have read it.
[02:26:56.559 --> 02:26:57.360]  I scanned through it.
[02:26:57.380 --> 02:26:59.981]  I've used the bibliography, the index, to look for key things in it.
[02:27:00.581 --> 02:27:02.321]  And yeah, they're just right out in the open.
[02:27:02.802 --> 02:27:04.002]  Yeah, I thought it was really interesting.
[02:27:04.022 --> 02:27:08.844]  He talks about, uh, Nelson talks about the, uh, Bohemian Grove, uh,
[02:27:10.202 --> 02:27:12.003]  You know what you've got to do?
[02:27:12.063 --> 02:27:20.908]  I've got a guest coming up, but you've got to write me a story about your review of that book, and we'd post it on PrisonPlanet.com, or call me back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:27:20.948 --> 02:27:24.650]  or next Monday, and I'll put you ahead of the line because I want to discuss that book.
[02:27:25.250 --> 02:27:26.371]  I've got it around here somewhere.
[02:27:26.611 --> 02:27:28.572]  We'll be right back with our big guest.
[02:27:28.592 --> 02:27:29.492]  Hopefully, stay with us.
[02:27:35.495 --> 02:27:36.516]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.896 --> 02:27:38.397]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.406 --> 02:27:42.247]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.368 --> 02:27:45.808]  Attention!
[02:27:45.929 --> 02:27:47.889]  This is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[02:27:48.089 --> 02:27:52.351]  Honeybees are now mysteriously vanishing at an astonishing pace across the entire country.
[02:27:52.511 --> 02:27:55.432]  Why is this urgent message about honeybees so desperately important?
[02:27:55.672 --> 02:27:56.633]  The answer is easy.
[02:27:56.773 --> 02:28:02.955]  You see, honeybees produce a unique compound, fed only to the queen, that makes her live six times longer than other bees in the hive.
[02:28:03.175 --> 02:28:07.238]  Some researchers now believe the compound may have miraculous effects on humans as well.
[02:28:07.418 --> 02:28:13.362]  The compound is called Royal Jelly, and is now available in an all-new, ultra-purified form called Gelosene Gold.
[02:28:13.542 --> 02:28:18.945]  The product has been designed for purity-conscious Americans who are concerned about contaminated Royal Jelly entering the U.S.
[02:28:18.985 --> 02:28:19.445]  from Asia.
[02:28:19.646 --> 02:28:24.008]  Solutions from Science is the only company authorized to sell Gelosene Gold in the U.S.
[02:28:24.248 --> 02:28:28.151]  They believe it to be the purest, most potent, and safest form of Royal Jelly in the world.
[02:28:28.351 --> 02:28:28.792]  We're good.
[02:28:45.189 --> 02:28:46.910]  It's not a matter of if, but when.
[02:28:47.290 --> 02:28:50.651]  If it happens, you want to be ready to give your loved ones a fighting chance.
[02:28:50.931 --> 02:28:55.373]  Do not rely on someone else to come through for you at a time when it could be about life and death.
[02:28:55.753 --> 02:29:00.735]  Your best chance is Safe Castle Royal, the premier crisis preparedness buyer's club out there.

[02:29:12.199 --> 02:29:12.419]  I think so.
[02:29:42.159 --> 02:29:43.700]  And it comes with being prepared.
[02:29:46.461 --> 02:29:49.143]  So you've decided to make the switch to a healthier lifestyle.
[02:29:49.303 --> 02:29:51.104]  Eating more organic fruits and vegetables.
[02:29:51.264 --> 02:29:52.785]  Staying away from unhealthy snacking.
[02:29:52.865 --> 02:29:54.666]  And cutting out dangerous salts from your diet.
[02:29:54.906 --> 02:29:57.448]  The only problem is you don't know how to keep it interesting.
[02:29:57.688 --> 02:30:00.269]  We are happy to introduce to you the Excalibur Dehydrator.

[02:30:09.254 --> 02:30:10.515]  The best yogurt is made from home.

[02:30:33.170 --> 02:30:33.510]  That's 1-800-875-4254.
[02:30:45.599 --> 02:30:46.160]  Oh, no!
[02:31:24.715 --> 02:31:29.276]  The quiet war can't be good with silent weapons.
[02:31:29.757 --> 02:31:34.438]  A mixture of slavery and the pain the people bore.
[02:31:34.518 --> 02:31:35.519]  It's stupid.
[02:31:42.136 --> 02:31:42.816]  Did you hear that?
[02:31:43.016 --> 02:31:44.597]  Norvos Ordom Seclarum.
[02:31:45.157 --> 02:31:46.077]  Murphy's Law.
[02:31:46.898 --> 02:31:48.678]  Every time I have a big guest on there's problems.
[02:31:49.138 --> 02:31:52.800]  We just had them on the line and then the line broke up and dropped off.
[02:31:54.240 --> 02:31:56.901]  And so we're trying to get them on the line right now.
[02:31:57.621 --> 02:31:58.321]  C'est la vie.
[02:31:58.722 --> 02:32:05.984]  But the good news is, is that more and more people are waking up to the New World Order and Megadeth's new album is just jam-packed.
[02:32:06.630 --> 02:32:08.932]  With pro-freedom, anti-New World Order messages.
[02:32:08.972 --> 02:32:09.493]  You just heard them.
[02:32:09.793 --> 02:32:11.074]  Norvos Ordo Seclarum.
[02:32:11.514 --> 02:32:12.615]  New World Order.
[02:32:14.477 --> 02:32:19.061]  And it's just incredible the things that are happening in this country and worldwide.
[02:32:19.081 --> 02:32:22.043]  I mean, Ron Paul raised almost six million dollars.
[02:32:22.103 --> 02:32:25.106]  Five and a half plus million dollars in the last quarter.
[02:32:25.226 --> 02:32:27.148]  And Mitt Romney raised like three million.
[02:32:28.809 --> 02:32:32.172]  Ron Paul has more MySpace and Meetup
[02:32:33.567 --> 02:32:41.233]  Friends than all the Republican candidates and many of the Democratic candidates combined, but the media still says that he's not a first-tier candidate?
[02:32:43.835 --> 02:32:44.356]  Think about it.
[02:32:45.657 --> 02:32:51.401]  Think about how much momentum the Freedom and Liberty and Anti-New World Order movement has got.
[02:32:52.362 --> 02:33:02.030]  And more and more people are waking up, more and more people are getting involved every single day.
[02:33:02.970 --> 02:33:03.731]  I don't know.
[02:33:23.473 --> 02:33:25.954]  Well, we'll play that at the end of the show today.
[02:33:26.014 --> 02:33:37.078]  Remind me to do that, because Endgame shows what the globalists are trying to set up, why they finance terrorism, why they're setting up this world government, why they see human beings as something that need to be exterminated.
[02:33:37.498 --> 02:33:42.560]  But we do have our guest, Dave Mustaine, and Dave Mustaine, of course, is a legendary
[02:33:43.835 --> 02:33:44.276]  I don't know.
[02:34:02.176 --> 02:34:05.259]  Dave even wants to hear this, but I like them a lot more than I like Metallica.
[02:34:05.799 --> 02:34:10.443]  And I remember the lyrics were all about corruption in government, the UN, world government, new world order.
[02:34:11.163 --> 02:34:19.450]  And now we see so many big artists, whether they be country or rock and roll or heavy metal or techno, singing about this.
[02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:24.754]  But I've got to say, Dave Mustaine was doing this 20 years ago.
[02:34:25.275 --> 02:34:26.756]  And sir, it's great to have you on with us.
[02:34:27.416 --> 02:34:27.797]  Oh, thank you.
[02:34:29.023 --> 02:34:33.147]  Really, a few weeks ago I had a chance to hear your new album and got it.
[02:34:33.167 --> 02:34:37.891]  We were listening to it around the office and I said, man, that's even more powerful than stuff 15, 20 years ago.
[02:34:38.732 --> 02:34:48.501]  Can you tell us basically what the drive was or what fired you up to produce this new album, Megadeth, United Abominations?
[02:34:50.819 --> 02:34:54.462]  Of course, you know, traveling around the world you get to see a lot of other countries.
[02:34:54.482 --> 02:35:02.149]  You get to see the dynamic between, actually the dichotomy between what we believe is freedom and what other people believe is freedom.
[02:35:02.169 --> 02:35:16.381]  A couple days ago, I was in Hampton Beach at a place and the DJ for one of the radio stations on the FM dial had said something, let's give it up for our troops and I heard somebody boo and I was so pissed.
[02:35:16.441 --> 02:35:18.523]  I went out onto the stage and I said,
[02:35:20.088 --> 02:35:25.815]  I'm listening to you guys cheer and blah, blah, blah because my speaking voice on stage is a little different from what I'm talking normally.
[02:35:26.396 --> 02:35:28.638]  And I said, you know, there's two words I don't say anywhere.
[02:35:28.678 --> 02:35:31.802]  There's the N-word and the C-word, but I've got to break rank right now.
[02:35:32.002 --> 02:35:34.926]  You that booed our troops are a, you know, the C-word, whatever.
[02:35:34.966 --> 02:35:36.788]  I don't want to be disrespectful on your station.
[02:35:37.575 --> 02:35:43.299]  And everybody cheered, and I said, you know, the thing that makes me sick is that you wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for these people.
[02:35:43.339 --> 02:35:45.841]  Whether we're there or not, it doesn't matter.
[02:35:45.881 --> 02:35:46.861]  It's not their choice.
[02:35:46.961 --> 02:35:47.502]  They're there.
[02:35:47.522 --> 02:35:52.305]  It's been like this since the beginning of our country, having soldiers that have to go to war.
[02:35:53.072 --> 02:35:53.753]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:36:10.193 --> 02:36:20.540]  I guess then Orlando's going to get sacrificed if any nuclear missile needs to be steered into a city that's going to have to be given up because of collateral damage.
[02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:23.441]  Go to Orlando and Hampton Beach first, okay?
[02:36:23.461 --> 02:36:26.963]  Because there's a lot of other people in the country that... Well, Dave, let me ask you this.
[02:36:28.104 --> 02:36:44.616]  Because it is complex lyrics and going back to some of the first albums you put out right through I mean I remember having a t-shirt for peace sells but who's buying because I want to see you guys I think at reunion arena or something and there are a bunch of other bands opening up for you and it had somebody
[02:36:44.616 --> 02:36:51.820]  Well, I'm just basically reading from history books, textbooks, and the Bible and stuff like that, where I get the facts that I believe in.
[02:37:13.673 --> 02:37:23.176]  And you know, not all music is actually truthful, but I think that, you know, what I try and do is write about stuff that we can actually do something about.
[02:37:23.216 --> 02:37:28.697]  You know, I mean, not like the old hippie writers from the 60s that were into, you know, lovins and stuff.
[02:37:28.838 --> 02:37:33.559]  I think in order to be a strong nation, somebody needs to get a black eye once in a while.
[02:37:34.079 --> 02:37:39.180]  You know, I mean, we are so sissified, our country, by being PC.
[02:37:39.580 --> 02:37:40.020]  You know what?
[02:37:40.301 --> 02:37:42.381]  You don't say somebody's plump, you say they're fat.
[02:37:42.421 --> 02:37:44.582]  If somebody's short, you don't say they're vertically challenged.
[02:37:44.622 --> 02:37:48.362]  I mean, we're such a gutless country anymore to say what the truth is, you know?
[02:37:48.382 --> 02:37:52.043]  And for me, I don't mince my words.
[02:37:52.223 --> 02:37:55.084]  I don't, you know, you can never have to ask me what I'm thinking.
[02:37:55.444 --> 02:38:02.986]  The political lyrics of this record are something that we all feel and needs to be said, and people are too gutless in the music industry to say it, because they're afraid they're going to lose record sales.
[02:38:03.306 --> 02:38:05.808]  Bottom line, what do you think about the UN?
[02:38:05.848 --> 02:38:11.253]  They put out a press release a few weeks ago basically attacking your new CD.
[02:38:11.773 --> 02:38:13.254]  A. Did you see that?
[02:38:13.414 --> 02:38:14.595]  B. What do you think of the UN?
[02:38:15.957 --> 02:38:22.782]  I didn't see it and I don't care about them because they're ineffective at their job so they're probably equally as ineffective at picking good bands.
[02:38:22.802 --> 02:38:27.246]  If you think about it, look what's happened.
[02:38:28.284 --> 02:38:41.853]  Just the fact, if we look back at the last conflict in Lebanon, how long it took them to do anything, and the fact they sent 600 French sailors to resolve the conflict, that's, you know, with the conversion rate, that's about three of our Rangers, if even that.
[02:38:43.536 --> 02:38:46.337]  By the way, my sister was born in Dallas, too, so I'm right there with you.
[02:38:46.877 --> 02:38:49.638]  Well, I'm in Austin, Texas.
[02:38:51.559 --> 02:38:57.220]  Now, Dave, again, we're talking to the founder of Megadeth and lead guitarist and also the lead singer.
[02:38:58.601 --> 02:39:08.584]  Dave, you show on the cover of this new CD, United Abominations, with missiles flying in and blasting in to the United Nations.
[02:39:08.624 --> 02:39:09.824]  Those aren't missiles, bud.
[02:39:10.245 --> 02:39:11.245]  Those are oil barrels.
[02:39:12.152 --> 02:39:13.353]  Oil barrels, all right.
[02:39:13.813 --> 02:39:15.534]  Well, they certainly look like projectiles to me.
[02:39:15.795 --> 02:39:17.636]  What does this cover symbolize?
[02:39:18.797 --> 02:39:23.200]  They are projectiles because the oil barrels are lit on fire because oil is basically the blood of the earth.
[02:39:25.221 --> 02:39:27.122]  Excuse me, I've got a little bit of some bronchitis still.
[02:39:27.483 --> 02:39:28.403]  One second.
[02:39:30.465 --> 02:39:41.793]  And the whole unbelievable nature that Kofi Annan's son would be involved in the whole oil for food thing just blew my mind.
[02:39:42.153 --> 02:39:45.275]  And the fact that a lot of people say, we went because of oil.
[02:39:46.295 --> 02:39:49.217]  The fact we won't drill up in the North because of the friggin' caribou.
[02:39:49.498 --> 02:39:49.838]  You know what?
[02:39:50.278 --> 02:39:51.159]  They taste like chicken.
[02:39:51.219 --> 02:39:51.699]  Let's eat them.
[02:39:51.959 --> 02:39:52.520]  Drill for oil.
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:53.060]  We're okay.
[02:39:54.495 --> 02:40:04.499]  Well, certainly, what's happening is they don't want to drill because it will make the oil cheaper, and they want to have artificial scarcity, and I agree they should drill up there.
[02:40:04.539 --> 02:40:06.480]  So how do you see this geopolitical system?
[02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:17.744]  I mean, do you see the United Nations, you just mentioned the Bible, as somehow being the arbiter of the Antichrist or as an evil force?
[02:40:17.784 --> 02:40:21.646]  I mean, I know I do from their own documents and what they push and what they're saying.
[02:40:22.166 --> 02:40:25.189]  Well, I'm not a right wing person for sure.
[02:40:25.249 --> 02:40:28.551]  I'm very, very in the middle because I see good and bad in everything I see.
[02:40:29.964 --> 02:40:39.772]  As far as you mentioning me saying something about the Bible, that's one source for what I was using for information for what I write about because I watch the news quite a lot.
[02:40:39.853 --> 02:40:41.114]  I love listening to talk radio.
[02:40:41.154 --> 02:40:43.275]  I listen to NPR back where I'm at.
[02:40:43.596 --> 02:40:49.661]  I don't know if your station is syndicated out where I'm at, but I like listening to people who have something to talk about.
[02:40:50.141 --> 02:40:54.225]  You get on the radio and you're listening to these morning jocks on FM radio.
[02:40:54.665 --> 02:40:57.847]  It's mindless, lowest common denominator, flatulence jokes.
[02:41:11.394 --> 02:41:18.819]  Talk about the UN sex trade, and I mean everywhere they go they kidnap children, women, they've been caught over and over, but they never get in trouble.
[02:41:19.139 --> 02:41:22.261]  And you also talk about how when they're in New York they get caught with slaves.
[02:41:22.541 --> 02:41:23.322]  I mean, I agree.
[02:41:23.362 --> 02:41:27.024]  I mean, this is the stuff I've ranted and raved about, so I just wanted to thank you for exposing that.
[02:41:27.632 --> 02:41:37.340]  Yeah, well, I mean, I try to do what I can as a patriot for our country to let people that are, you know, my fellow countrymen realize, you know, how good we have it.
[02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:39.381]  They haven't been to Indonesia, I have.
[02:41:39.401 --> 02:41:44.205]  They haven't been into Bosnia or Herzegovina, I have.
[02:41:45.017 --> 02:41:53.201]  You know, they haven't been to parts of the Czech Republic that used to be called Czechoslovakia, but because of the Civil War broke into pieces.
[02:41:53.781 --> 02:42:02.365]  You know, they haven't been pulled over at machine gun point by foreign military people just to rifle through our stuff because we're Americans.
[02:42:02.845 --> 02:42:09.348]  You know, when you realize what it feels like over there to be so far away from our home here and how good we have it here,
[02:42:10.271 --> 02:42:16.095]  Maybe people will change the way that they feel about what they say, and how they take for granted, you know, what it's like to be an American.
[02:42:17.316 --> 02:42:18.497]  Well, sure.
[02:42:18.937 --> 02:42:23.680]  You know, when you see the Pope get on the ground and kiss the floor, you know, I mean, that's totally cool.
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:24.681]  Like, I can see that.
[02:42:24.881 --> 02:42:26.382]  He looks at ground as being sacred.
[02:42:26.522 --> 02:42:27.323]  I love our country.
[02:42:27.423 --> 02:42:28.083]  I love being here.
[02:42:28.163 --> 02:42:28.783]  I love playing here.
[02:42:28.824 --> 02:42:30.164]  I love representing us, too.
[02:42:31.005 --> 02:42:35.088]  I'm not the typical American, because most Americans, you know, they are afraid to say stuff.
[02:42:35.188 --> 02:42:35.568]  I'm not.
[02:42:36.028 --> 02:42:39.831]  So, I don't want a lot of the world to think that Americans are loudmouths like me, but
[02:42:40.282 --> 02:42:47.027]  You know, the good thing is, is I have the strength of numbers, and I love meeting people like yourself that have said, you know, I listened to you and it got me thinking.
[02:42:47.047 --> 02:42:48.288]  Got me thinking!
[02:42:48.308 --> 02:42:49.328]  You know?
[02:42:49.709 --> 02:42:50.389]  You were right, Dave.
[02:42:50.429 --> 02:42:51.210]  You weren't wrong, Dave.
[02:42:51.290 --> 02:42:55.293]  You were perfect because you made me decide for myself.
[02:42:55.313 --> 02:43:07.001]  When I went to the 92 Democratic National Convention at Madison Square Garden, brother, I went there not as a Democrat, not as a Republican, as a New World person that was a renaissance man, a universal citizen.
[02:43:07.501 --> 02:43:13.223]  And I ask questions that we as young people in America need to get answers to that no one will tell us because we're stupid kids.
[02:43:13.703 --> 02:43:26.428]  I remember several of the albums that came out in the late 80s, early 90s, I guess up until about 1991 or so, maybe 1990, where you were talking about false wars, fake wars, New World Order.
[02:43:27.529 --> 02:43:32.851]  I mean, again, that's all really chic right now to talk about that, but I'm trying to find out
[02:43:33.411 --> 02:43:38.955]  What made you start thinking about world government and how the UN wanted to take over?
[02:43:38.975 --> 02:43:40.396]  I mean, that's what I got from your lyrics.
[02:44:04.733 --> 02:44:18.148]  I really understood that my role in life was not just to kind of stumble through, make babies, die, and then my life is measured by the dash in between the year I was born on and the year I died on my headstone.
[02:44:18.268 --> 02:44:20.451]  I had to do something more important with myself.
[02:44:21.966 --> 02:44:22.747]  I think I've done that.
[02:44:23.087 --> 02:44:25.390]  Now, I just watched Pavarotti die, and I think, you know what?
[02:44:25.530 --> 02:44:28.834]  Right now, I'm probably the only person who says Pavarotti's name in the last week.
[02:44:29.374 --> 02:44:34.380]  When I die, you know, I think, wow, how long is it going to be before my name isn't mentioned anymore?
[02:44:34.420 --> 02:44:36.423]  How long is it going to be before people don't think about me anymore?
[02:44:36.443 --> 02:44:41.569]  Because, you know, I mean, ultimately, that's what you matter in life, the memory that you leave behind you, the legacy.
[02:44:42.541 --> 02:44:49.844]  The only thing I've left is inspiring young people to get involved in politics and for young people to get involved in government with health care and stuff like that.
[02:44:50.204 --> 02:45:01.469]  I meet so many doctors and so many young doctor's assistants or physician's assistants, blah, blah, blah, that stayed in school because they said, well, I was in a band, man, and I asked you advice and you said stay in school.
[02:45:01.569 --> 02:45:03.530]  I did, man, and I'm lucky.
[02:45:03.550 --> 02:45:05.251]  Yeah, you are lucky.
[02:45:05.271 --> 02:45:07.212]  It's hard to make it in the music business.
[02:45:09.526 --> 02:45:11.587]  How did you get into music?
[02:45:11.627 --> 02:45:15.828]  I mean, when did you first decide that you wanted to be in a metal band?
[02:45:16.368 --> 02:45:19.449]  Well, like I was saying, being 15 years old, my mom moving out, I was in 76.
[02:45:19.549 --> 02:45:21.669]  It's like a 10-year-old living on the street now.
[02:45:22.169 --> 02:45:26.351]  I had to learn fast and hard the rules of life, and I ain't no crybaby.
[02:45:26.371 --> 02:45:27.671]  This isn't no hard luck story.
[02:45:27.711 --> 02:45:31.432]  I'm talking about the human will, what you can do.
[02:45:32.307 --> 02:45:50.784]  You know, and I ain't Tony Robbins either, but, you know, I figured out for myself what I needed to do real young, and because my mind had to be matured so early to be an adult at 15, to be living like a grown-up as a, just barely past being a preteen, you know, and that's hard.
[02:45:50.924 --> 02:45:53.907]  So I just got thrown into the blender and just went with it.
[02:45:56.241 --> 02:46:02.344]  Well, you certainly have produced some of the most prolific and complex music and lyrics.
[02:46:03.225 --> 02:46:10.209]  And again, I'm just amazed by the subjects that you were talking about 15, 20 years ago, and now today.
[02:46:10.889 --> 02:46:12.850]  And the UN is a criminal organization.
[02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:14.491]  I mean, the directors of it are criminal.
[02:46:14.511 --> 02:46:15.492]  It's just like the Red Cross.
[02:46:15.512 --> 02:46:19.694]  There are well-meaning people throughout it, and then the Red Cross gets caught stealing money at the top.
[02:46:20.894 --> 02:46:27.777]  Some of your lyrics, you talk about the UN will be destroyed because you talk about how they foster terrorism and a lot of other things.
[02:46:29.378 --> 02:46:31.258]  Am I interpreting those lyrics correctly?
[02:46:32.259 --> 02:46:39.081]  Fostering is a peculiar word to use, so I'm not going to agree to that because I don't know if everybody that's listening right now knows what that means.
[02:46:39.161 --> 02:46:39.581]  Sure.
[02:46:40.562 --> 02:46:45.864]  What I'm going to say is that they turned a blind eye to it a lot of times when they could have stopped it.
[02:46:46.508 --> 02:46:49.431]  You know, there's a game that's going on over in South Africa.
[02:46:49.531 --> 02:46:54.655]  For the female listeners here, this is mortifying, so if you can't handle it, don't listen.
[02:46:55.496 --> 02:46:56.937]  For the guys, you know what?
[02:46:56.997 --> 02:46:58.338]  This is just dreadful.
[02:46:58.799 --> 02:47:06.545]  The rebels over there are slicing pregnant women in half because they're gambling on what the sex of the baby is.
[02:47:07.166 --> 02:47:10.829]  Woman dies, baby dies, guy wins maybe five or six coconuts.
[02:47:13.183 --> 02:47:14.323]  And they necklace people.
[02:47:14.664 --> 02:47:15.144]  Exactly.
[02:47:15.184 --> 02:47:17.405]  There is just raging evil everywhere.
[02:47:17.465 --> 02:47:21.266]  And that's why our liberties and freedoms are so important and we need to protect them.
[02:47:22.126 --> 02:47:23.267]  And I guess that's the message.
[02:47:23.327 --> 02:47:31.430]  And I agree with you, regardless of whose policies are right or wrong, you know, the individuals that are stepping up to this country need to be praised for that.
[02:47:32.250 --> 02:47:36.892]  I was just earlier talking to some military people that have been through quite a bit in the first hour.
[02:47:37.233 --> 02:47:40.114]  Well, Dave Mustaine, I really want to thank you for coming on the show.
[02:47:41.514 --> 02:47:45.616]  How is the new album going, Megadeth, United Abominations?
[02:47:46.477 --> 02:47:55.461]  Well, there's been a lot of missteps along the way because, you know, we're just getting used to the new label and they're hiring people still that
[02:47:56.656 --> 02:47:57.858]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:48:11.514 --> 02:48:16.536]  I think it's one of your better albums and we really want to thank you for coming on.
[02:48:36.864 --> 02:48:38.125]  Oh, you're welcome, buddy.
[02:48:38.325 --> 02:48:41.447]  I'm happy to see that you're standing up too, man.
[02:48:41.767 --> 02:48:42.207]  Thank you.
[02:48:42.227 --> 02:48:49.010]  It's here.
[02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:53.993]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.333 --> 02:49:01.937]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.665 --> 02:49:09.752]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.132 --> 02:49:13.035]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq.
[02:49:13.456 --> 02:49:15.778]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:16.178 --> 02:49:17.019]  NSA spying.
[02:49:17.495 --> 02:49:21.496]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.836 --> 02:49:25.417]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.797 --> 02:49:28.018]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.078 --> 02:49:32.019]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:45.263 --> 02:50:47.104]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:50:47.244 --> 02:50:52.427]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:50:52.607 --> 02:50:53.948]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:50:54.208 --> 02:51:02.392]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:51:02.612 --> 02:51:08.395]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:51:08.515 --> 02:51:10.276]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:51:10.356 --> 02:51:12.457]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:51:12.637 --> 02:51:16.882]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:51:17.062 --> 02:51:19.185]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:51:19.285 --> 02:51:27.053]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:51:27.554 --> 02:51:28.934]  It is a big idea.
[02:51:28.954 --> 02:51:30.014]  A new world order.
[02:51:30.134 --> 02:51:31.535]  In the near future.
[02:51:56.411 --> 02:52:00.535]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[02:52:00.555 --> 02:52:07.140]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:52:25.632 --> 02:52:30.714]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:52:31.774 --> 02:52:36.256]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:52:36.296 --> 02:52:39.797]  The old America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:52:40.357 --> 02:52:43.898]  Only an educated, informed public can stop them in their tracks.
[02:52:44.258 --> 02:52:46.859]  Alex, would you shut up, yeah?
[02:52:46.939 --> 02:52:50.000]  For the first time, all the pieces have been put together.
[02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:53.921]  The dots have been connected, and the picture is crystal clear.
[02:52:55.140 --> 02:52:59.463]  Earth's ruling elite believe they have discovered the fountain of unity.
[02:52:59.503 --> 02:53:03.727]  But before they can attain it, 80% of us must die.
[02:53:05.268 --> 02:53:11.212]  A psychopathic technocracy is establishing world government so there can be no escape from their plan.
[02:53:16.690 --> 02:53:18.912]  The New World Order is the Old World Order.
[02:53:18.972 --> 02:53:20.174]  I mean, it's just the names have changed.
[02:53:20.194 --> 02:53:21.675]  The appearances have changed.
[02:53:21.935 --> 02:53:23.057]  Most people have no idea.
[02:53:23.097 --> 02:53:23.877]  They're not after money.
[02:53:23.897 --> 02:53:24.998]  They have all the money they need.
[02:53:25.219 --> 02:53:25.979]  They're after power.
[02:53:26.940 --> 02:53:27.861]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[02:53:27.881 --> 02:53:31.465]  I was pulled off a plane.
[02:53:31.525 --> 02:53:33.287]  I knew I'd be interrogated in four hours.
[02:53:33.307 --> 02:53:34.248]  Some shots were fired.
[02:53:34.268 --> 02:53:35.429]  I need you to move out of the process.
[02:53:35.469 --> 02:53:36.550]  All right, my friends.
[02:53:36.590 --> 02:53:40.073]  That is part of the new official trailer that is WhatIsTheEndGame.com.
[02:53:41.275 --> 02:53:42.836]  In closing, folks, you need to support our sponsors
[02:54:04.332 --> 02:54:06.613]  And one of them is the RonPaulDollar.net.

[02:54:08.193 --> 02:54:12.054]  You know, those beautiful silver, bronze, gold rounds.
[02:54:13.255 --> 02:54:14.615]  Silver dollar, which is like a silver dollar.
[02:54:14.975 --> 02:54:16.496]  The gold dollar looks like a gold coin.
[02:54:16.516 --> 02:54:17.156]  It is a gold coin.
[02:54:17.476 --> 02:54:19.476]  Beautiful ounce coins.
[02:54:19.496 --> 02:54:20.717]  888 LibDollar.
[02:54:20.737 --> 02:54:21.537]  888 LibDollar.

[02:54:21.817 --> 02:54:23.097]  With Ron Paul's face on it.
[02:54:23.137 --> 02:54:24.098]  What a collector's item.
[02:54:28.599 --> 02:54:30.800]  And they've got them right now at RonPaulDollar.net.
[02:54:30.820 --> 02:54:35.181]  There's a banner on PrisonPlanet.com if you miss it.

[02:54:51.786 --> 02:54:52.606]  What do I say about them?
[02:54:52.726 --> 02:54:54.446]  They've been around since August of 1980, 27 years plus.
[02:54:57.663 --> 02:54:59.865]  They woke so many people up, it makes my head spin.
[02:54:59.905 --> 02:55:04.749]  It is a free, Time Magazine style, nice, glossy magazine.
[02:55:05.210 --> 02:55:05.450]  Free!
[02:55:05.690 --> 02:55:07.451]  They just call, they give me their address.
