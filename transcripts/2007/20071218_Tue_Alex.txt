[00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:06.594]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.254 --> 00:00:08.335]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:10.115]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.775 --> 00:00:11.595]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:13.236]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.256 --> 00:00:17.856]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.097 --> 00:00:22.217]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.198 --> 00:00:30.799]  They had a newscast two nights ago in Austin about a horrible flu going around town.
[00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:34.760]  It starts in your throat as a strep throat.
[00:00:35.586 --> 00:00:36.346]  That's what I've got.
[00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:38.287]  Yes, I'm insane.
[00:00:38.388 --> 00:00:46.052]  I shouldn't be here on air, but I'm taking off part of next week, and so I am not going to take off this week.
[00:00:46.072 --> 00:00:48.013]  So I drug my hind end out of bed.
[00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:50.514]  I did go to bed at 8 o'clock last night, though.
[00:00:51.152 --> 00:01:14.392]  I drug my hind end out of bed and I am here ladies and gentlemen because the money bomb just happened a day and a half ago as you know 6.6 million is the final official tally because see when they first announced it after the Sunday ended they hadn't collated all the mail that came in that weekend they hadn't collated all of the money that was given for the money bomb over the telephone 6.6
[00:01:19.557 --> 00:01:23.419]  Million, and the news called it a pathetic failure.
[00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:26.840]  That's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.562]  The media, one big media outlet, called it a pathetic failure.
[00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:37.945]  That's right, 6.6 million, breaking all records, any record of any type for fundraising, carries with 6.1 mil.
[00:01:39.546 --> 00:01:40.886]  Doesn't matter, it's a pathetic failure.
[00:01:41.847 --> 00:01:45.969]  And they continue to not allow Ron Paul to be in most of the polls, and they say, well he doesn't show up in polls.
[00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.729]  Well, because you don't
[00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:51.574]  Put him in the poll and that has the effect of people not hearing his name.
[00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:54.617]  So, they're pulling out all the stops.
[00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:58.842]  We didn't talk enough about the money bomb yesterday because I got off into a bunch of other issues.
[00:01:58.862 --> 00:02:01.784]  We're going to have open phones for the full three hours today.
[00:02:02.845 --> 00:02:12.015]  Because, A, I've got a horrible sore throat and I really don't want to pontificate, though I do tend to do that and I'm sure I'll... I'm sure I'll...
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.580]  Do it.
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.641]  But we will be taking your calls today at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:26.102]  1-800-259-9231 and getting you up and on the air.
[00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:33.924]  Speaking of looking sick, well, I saw Ron Paul on Fox News this morning and he looked like he's got a cold or something.
[00:02:33.944 --> 00:02:36.024]  He can hardly talk and kind of out of it.
[00:02:36.044 --> 00:02:40.745]  Imagine being 72 years old and working about 16, 17 hours a day.
[00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.715]  And meeting and greeting people and going from event to event and doing interview after interview is grueling, because you get hyped up every time you're on the air.
[00:02:52.136 --> 00:03:01.622]  You get, uh, your adrenaline starts flowing, and then afterwards, you get even more exhausted, and there's another interview and another interview, so we've all got to be praying for Ron Paul.
[00:03:02.903 --> 00:03:04.984]  You know, I could get Ron Paul back on this December.
[00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:06.585]  He comes on once a month.
[00:03:08.126 --> 00:03:10.548]  But I think I'm not even going to have him on this December.
[00:03:11.195 --> 00:03:14.097]  I think I'll have him on in January, just so I can give him a break.
[00:03:14.137 --> 00:03:15.638]  I mean, at least a 30-minute break there.
[00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:23.963]  But then I see Ron Paul doing big interviews, little interviews, and I'm just like, well, might as well have him on here.
[00:03:23.983 --> 00:03:26.985]  At least I'll ask a lot of hard-hitting, serious questions.
[00:03:32.997 --> 00:03:37.221]  We've got a lot of other really important news and information we'll be covering today as well.
[00:03:37.401 --> 00:03:40.224]  Callers always take us in a lot of different interesting directions.
[00:03:40.244 --> 00:03:41.204]  You can talk about whatever you want.
[00:03:41.224 --> 00:03:49.872]  The economy, the Ron Paul revolution, how the establishment is countering, how you think they're going to counter, how will he do in Iowa, how will he do in New Hampshire, Michigan.
[00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:52.694]  Then I've got other reports like this.
[00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:57.178]  Knife at lunch gets a 10-year-old girl arrested at school.
[00:03:59.478 --> 00:04:15.987]  And, uh, she brought leftover steak from the night before, fifth grader, and pulled it out of her lunchbox and was cutting it up, and it was one of those little butter knives that's got the serrated edge, so they call it a steak knife, and they arrested her, felony charges.
[00:04:17.547 --> 00:04:24.271]  But I thought I'd read this story because it illustrates something larger, and I want to get into what's behind all this and where it's going in the future.
[00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.973]  Also, a World Food Stocks Dwindling Rapidly U.N.
[00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:41.284]  Report says, Daddy Bush Makes Skull and Bones Pilgrimage, 100,000 Young Britons Pushing Unemployment by Immigrants.
[00:04:43.646 --> 00:04:49.311]  This is only the tip of the iceberg of a lot of important news and information that we are going to be covering
[00:04:51.087 --> 00:04:53.528]  In the next two hours, 55 minutes.
[00:04:54.188 --> 00:05:00.950]  Your call's straight ahead at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.290]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:04.351 --> 00:05:05.411]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.111 --> 00:05:10.352]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:11.013 --> 00:05:13.213]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:13.833 --> 00:05:16.074]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.614 --> 00:05:19.035]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.782 --> 00:05:27.139]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:35.573]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.613 --> 00:05:39.095]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.455 --> 00:05:41.977]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:42.037 --> 00:05:43.178]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.198 --> 00:05:43.938]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.039]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:45.980]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.261]  That's what they're after, you see.

[00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:06.216]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:06.656 --> 00:07:10.881]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:07:11.302 --> 00:07:18.170]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:25.298]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:25.618 --> 00:07:27.240]  There are no reported side effects.
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.724]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:31.004 --> 00:07:32.206]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:32.446 --> 00:07:33.447]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:07:33.768 --> 00:07:34.889]  BioSolutions has over 550
[00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:36.210]  I think so.
[00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:06.265]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.625 --> 00:08:08.947]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:20.056 --> 00:08:26.661]  We've got several little news clips with Rob Hall that we'll be playing today.
[00:08:26.701 --> 00:08:28.323]  We're going to have wide open phones.
[00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:46.565]  I have to say that the Money Bomb Sunday that raised $6.6 million, now that's the official number that's in, breaking all records, shattering carries by over $500,000, has been a big success, obviously.
[00:08:46.866 --> 00:08:56.874]  And the way the news cycle works, people were saying, and I was saying, the media isn't giving this Money Bomb as much attention as it gave the last one.
[00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:14.174]  But now, scanning what was on television last night, scanning the different blogs that collate and collect all the different video clips, it looks like it was as big a response as of yesterday, and maybe even bigger today and tomorrow.
[00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:16.615]  So, a huge coup.
[00:09:17.175 --> 00:09:25.337]  Not just raising the $6.6 million that he can use for direct mailers, TV, radio, in the key battleground states with the
[00:09:26.563 --> 00:09:27.064]  I don't know.
[00:09:47.831 --> 00:09:48.372]  We're good to go.
[00:10:04.683 --> 00:10:13.130]  Uh, to quickly, those that aren't educated on how to do it, educated to be able to go out and poll watch and expose all of this as it unfolds.
[00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.213]  There's no doubt that there will be fraud.
[00:10:16.693 --> 00:10:19.315]  There's always fraud going back for hundreds of years.
[00:10:19.956 --> 00:10:24.720]  The problem with these electronic machines is that they can hide their fraud much easier.
[00:10:25.818 --> 00:10:35.305]  And they can then say it's proprietary, owned by the private companies, so you can't look under the hood, into the black box, and find out exactly what they're doing.
[00:10:35.805 --> 00:10:36.906]  No transparency.
[00:10:37.246 --> 00:10:38.507]  They just say, trust us.
[00:10:39.368 --> 00:10:45.652]  And for the last 50 years plus, exit polls have always been plus or minus 3 to 4 points.
[00:10:45.972 --> 00:10:48.014]  Very, very accurate.
[00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:56.814]  And so when you saw elections that were stolen, local or federal or state, you would see very small margins of theft.
[00:10:57.574 --> 00:11:06.158]  And now, magically in the last five, six years, that they put in these machines, and about 40% of the country now, it's grown.
[00:11:06.638 --> 00:11:07.899]  Some areas are now removing them.
[00:11:08.439 --> 00:11:09.600]  So that's a guesstimation.
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.622]  It's about 35% a year ago, but they say more have adopted it, so I'm just guessing it's 40%.
[00:11:13.662 --> 00:11:16.663]  But over 30% we now have them.
[00:11:20.445 --> 00:11:38.240]  Suddenly with exit polls we are seeing where the exit poll by 5, 10, 15 points is showing that the anti-establishment candidate is winning and then magically the pro-establishment that's got the big money behind them candidate magically wins.
[00:11:39.622 --> 00:11:40.883]  One of the first big ones was
[00:11:42.057 --> 00:11:53.681]  When Senator Chuck Hagel first got into office, there was big news articles about, does he own the electronic voting machine company that 82% of the state of Nebraska would be casting ballots on?
[00:11:54.482 --> 00:11:57.963]  And then he lied in the papers and went on television and said, I don't own this company.
[00:11:59.564 --> 00:12:00.784]  I own a little stock in it.
[00:12:01.645 --> 00:12:06.706]  Then it came out that he was the majority owner and on its board of directors and had been its chairman.
[00:12:07.567 --> 00:12:10.628]  And he was about 15 points behind in the polls.
[00:12:11.698 --> 00:12:17.340]  And then the exit polls show he lost by about 10 points, but it didn't matter, he won by 14 points.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.221]  Now, that's a 29% difference.
[00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:34.425]  You see, when the pre-polls and the exit polls are showing he's going to lose by 15 points and he wins by 14, that's a 29 point difference from the exit polls and the polls.
[00:12:35.225 --> 00:12:36.966]  That's fraud, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:37.246 --> 00:12:37.786]  There's no
[00:12:38.721 --> 00:12:39.662]  Way to get around it.
[00:12:40.042 --> 00:12:42.624]  Caught red-handed and nothing happens.
[00:12:44.285 --> 00:12:48.708]  That's just one of literally, literally thousands of examples.
[00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:57.895]  I mean, every time they have a off-year election or a big presidential election or regional elections, I mean, there are just hundreds of cases.
[00:12:59.236 --> 00:13:08.122]  Engineers from the companies have quit and gone public and said, I was hired to steal elections and design this for fraud and for wireless electronic access to flip votes
[00:13:08.777 --> 00:13:16.240]  They testify before the Florida Legislature, before the Iowa Legislature, before other legislatures, and it's never on the news!
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:33.606]  It'll be in the local regional news, and they'll just kind of calmly report in the back of the paper, yeah, the engineer from this company or that company, there's been a string of them, literally risked their lives, came out,
[00:13:34.514 --> 00:13:35.614]  Told us what was happening.
[00:13:36.194 --> 00:13:38.535]  People always say, well you can't keep a secret.
[00:13:39.115 --> 00:13:44.396]  Something this big, something this corrupt, you couldn't hide it.
[00:13:45.296 --> 00:13:46.537]  They haven't hidden it.
[00:13:47.137 --> 00:13:47.937]  It has come out.
[00:13:48.977 --> 00:13:50.618]  But they just moved forward.
[00:13:54.138 --> 00:14:01.120]  You'd think Governor Rick Perry getting all this money from Central Spain and handing over 8,000 miles of existing Texas roads
[00:14:01.764 --> 00:14:17.955]  With a law firm of Bracewell and Giuliani handling it, filled with Bilderberg Group members, even in the law firm, making hundreds of millions themselves off of it, just transparent corruption on its face, you would think that that would be a news item.
[00:14:18.415 --> 00:14:25.059]  But you can't even get the news to admit when Rick Perry has a press conference announcing trans-Texas corridors that it exists.
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:30.523]  I mean, we've entered a hyper-dimension or something of bizarro lies.
[00:14:31.525 --> 00:14:44.354]  Where they will deny basic things that are fact, knowing that about half the population literally doesn't know anything.
[00:14:45.695 --> 00:14:49.437]  From birth they were set in front of televisions five, ten hours a day.
[00:14:50.558 --> 00:14:52.319]  Some children watch over ten hours a day.
[00:14:52.379 --> 00:14:53.760]  It's over five hours on average.
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:54.681]  Adults over four hours.
[00:14:55.718 --> 00:14:57.039]  And they just are spectators.
[00:14:57.059 --> 00:14:58.280]  They don't know how anything works.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.781]  They don't know how anything operates.
[00:14:59.801 --> 00:15:01.462]  They don't understand systems.
[00:15:01.482 --> 00:15:02.763]  They don't understand anything.
[00:15:04.685 --> 00:15:06.466]  They literally are zombies.
[00:15:07.507 --> 00:15:20.656]  More and more, I talk to people, either people are awakening, getting more intelligent, more informed, more excited about the world, or they're getting deeper into zombie-ism.
[00:15:21.494 --> 00:15:23.915]  They're like sleepwalking.
[00:15:24.155 --> 00:15:25.736]  You just joined us and I shout strange.
[00:15:26.356 --> 00:15:28.977]  I have a really bad cold right now and a strep throat.
[00:15:28.997 --> 00:15:33.279]  I don't want to get graphic, but I'm popping blood up here.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.341]  Please don't call and tell me Cure Zero.
[00:15:37.421 --> 00:15:38.021]  Alex, keep it up.
[00:15:38.041 --> 00:15:38.481]  You're a great guy.
[00:15:38.501 --> 00:15:42.463]  I'm only telling you about it because I know you care about me, but I'm not whining.
[00:15:42.803 --> 00:15:44.624]  Just so you know, I sound a little strange today.
[00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:53.832]  Or why you may hear me pause when I hit the cop button, or why I may be a little bit dull today.
[00:15:55.613 --> 00:16:01.155]  And that's because I feel like a horse stomped on my throat and ears.
[00:16:02.495 --> 00:16:06.737]  Alright, so that's just some of the information here.
[00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:08.517]  I do want to go over the comments of Rand Paul.
[00:16:08.557 --> 00:16:13.259]  I do want to go over some of the media calling the 6.6 million dollar money bomb a failure.
[00:16:14.583 --> 00:16:17.505]  And you'd think, man, that's obviously ridiculous.
[00:16:17.525 --> 00:16:18.206]  That's a lie.
[00:16:18.246 --> 00:16:19.106]  That's stupid.
[00:16:20.347 --> 00:16:21.248]  That'll discredit them.
[00:16:22.989 --> 00:16:25.350]  The groups and outlets saying this don't care.
[00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:26.871]  They know you're already awake.
[00:16:28.853 --> 00:16:30.314]  And they don't care if you know they're liars.
[00:16:30.934 --> 00:16:42.041]  They're trying to keep that 50% out there who is completely mind-numbed, who only read headlines and then think they're intellectual for doing that, neutralized.
[00:16:42.182 --> 00:16:43.562]  Oh, Rob Paul's thing failed.
[00:16:43.603 --> 00:16:44.123]  Did you hear?
[00:16:47.515 --> 00:17:04.900]  I mean, if they'll publicly stage straw polls and say, Ron Paul won this one, so we're going to shut it down and not issue the results in California, or Ron Paul people are only allowed to vote once, but Mitt Romney people can vote as many times as they want, and say that in front of St.
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.001]  Petersburg Times video cameras.
[00:17:12.482 --> 00:17:16.563]  The last time I mentioned that, somebody emailed me and said, it's a newspaper, they're not TV.
[00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.571]  Most papers now do TV.
[00:17:21.051 --> 00:17:22.492]  Most papers now shoot video.
[00:17:22.512 --> 00:17:24.292]  There are also citizens out there shooting video.
[00:17:24.312 --> 00:17:30.134]  So, again, they're trying to come up to the Times, and they are doing video blogs, and you don't know what you're talking about.
[00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:41.158]  And sometimes I think these emails and calls I get are like jokes, and then I actually talk to the people or email them back, and they're still arguing with me, and I figure out they're just dumb!
[00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:47.300]  It's an amazing thing to realize that there are a lot of people who literally
[00:17:49.239 --> 00:17:51.741]  Are functional, functionally retarded.
[00:17:52.842 --> 00:17:57.346]  And again, they had the brain, they had the physiology to be intelligent.
[00:17:57.687 --> 00:17:59.688]  They weren't genetically retarded.
[00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.913]  They weren't mentally retarded via nature.
[00:18:06.514 --> 00:18:07.195]  It was nurture.
[00:18:08.752 --> 00:18:10.593]  They never were taught critical thinking.
[00:18:10.613 --> 00:18:11.913]  They were never taught the joy of learning.
[00:18:11.933 --> 00:18:16.735]  They were never taught how amazing history is and systems and how things work.
[00:18:17.235 --> 00:18:19.536]  They were never taught complex thought processes.
[00:18:20.377 --> 00:18:22.958]  And so, I'm just a commoner.
[00:18:23.718 --> 00:18:27.820]  I mean, I would be kind of a dull fellow to people back in 1776, and I really mean that.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.340]  I'm not romanticizing them.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.021]  I mean, literally.
[00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:34.682]  I would be somewhat dull compared to a Thomas Jefferson or a Benjamin Franklin.
[00:18:37.364 --> 00:18:38.144]  I've read their writings.
[00:18:40.023 --> 00:18:46.308]  And I have to, you know, sometimes in certain passages really focus to even understand what they're saying or look up the words they're using.
[00:18:47.068 --> 00:18:52.532]  And the thoughts are so subtle and multivariate with so few words is the incredible part too.
[00:18:52.872 --> 00:18:58.356]  It's easy to give a complex thought in a big, big bulk release.
[00:18:59.357 --> 00:19:05.441]  But they could do it just right off their tongue and poetry of language.
[00:19:06.682 --> 00:19:07.823]  So I'm this dull,
[00:19:08.937 --> 00:19:10.538]  You're like a different
[00:19:24.087 --> 00:19:24.527]  We're good to go.
[00:19:44.597 --> 00:19:45.818]  The ultimate greediness.
[00:19:45.878 --> 00:19:47.080]  The ultimate selfishness.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.384]  To dumb down whole societies just so they're more easily controlled?
[00:19:51.845 --> 00:19:54.087]  That is a crime against the soul of humanity.
[00:19:54.107 --> 00:19:55.628]  And a crime against God.
[00:19:55.889 --> 00:19:56.890]  Your call is straight ahead.
[00:20:02.189 --> 00:20:04.571]  Ted Anders from Midas, December 14, 2007.
[00:20:05.011 --> 00:20:11.935]  Gold 789.91 ounce gold coins to be purchased for 813.86, 401.15 for half, 258 for quarter.
[00:20:12.435 --> 00:20:14.897]  That's 813.86, 401.15 and 258.
[00:20:15.057 --> 00:20:19.280]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.762]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[00:20:24.143 --> 00:20:28.085]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[00:20:28.385 --> 00:20:30.226]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[00:20:30.586 --> 00:20:32.307]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[00:20:32.567 --> 00:20:38.550]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[00:20:38.991 --> 00:20:45.774]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[00:20:46.114 --> 00:20:46.995]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[00:20:47.055 --> 00:20:47.915]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.319 --> 00:20:56.443]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[00:20:56.544 --> 00:20:56.864]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:56.924 --> 00:20:58.527]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:06.234]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:21:06.654 --> 00:21:09.597]  Soon, it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:21:09.897 --> 00:21:12.460]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.664]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:21:18.024 --> 00:21:23.409]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:21:23.709 --> 00:21:26.672]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:21:26.852 --> 00:21:27.412]  We're good to go.
[00:21:50.248 --> 00:21:55.713]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:21:55.733 --> 00:21:56.153]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:22:02.073 --> 00:22:05.635]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:22:05.675 --> 00:22:06.176]  are located?
[00:22:06.396 --> 00:22:09.778]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:22:10.018 --> 00:22:14.701]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.662]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:05.283 --> 00:23:14.213]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:14.654 --> 00:23:21.862]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:22.569 --> 00:23:28.074]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die, with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:23:28.554 --> 00:23:39.384]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size, without adverse side effects, at our physician's office.
[00:23:40.145 --> 00:23:42.227]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:23:42.727 --> 00:23:44.108]  For more information, call 702-9534.
[00:23:51.002 --> 00:24:06.273]  Alright, I've got a news report also talking about suicide and antidepressants we're going to be playing.
[00:24:06.493 --> 00:24:10.595]  Got another clip going back over a decade.
[00:24:20.879 --> 00:24:31.023]  Dealing with how they're going to turn existing roads into toll roads, which they deny they're doing in Texas as they put them on the existing roads.
[00:24:31.584 --> 00:24:33.745]  They go, there's no toll road as there's a toll road there.
[00:24:34.565 --> 00:24:43.169]  See, it's a new level of lying, because they know people are in cognitive dissonance, and so they just engage in mass mind control.
[00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:48.091]  Let's talk to Kenneth in Kentucky, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:24:50.288 --> 00:24:55.892]  If Ron Paul wins, and then multiple nukes start going off and terror attacks all over the place, what are we going to do?
[00:24:56.033 --> 00:24:57.914]  And what is Ron Paul really going to be able to do?
[00:24:57.994 --> 00:25:12.785]  Because I know it wouldn't be him responsible for it, but the people who have infiltrated the government, but aren't actually the government, the people with all this power, if they go ahead and do this when he gets into power, you know, what are we going to do?
[00:25:13.686 --> 00:25:19.771]  Well, that's why about a year and a half after 9-11, when they attacked Iraq, Bush actually said, forget about Bin Laden,
[00:25:20.894 --> 00:25:22.535]  Forget about 9-11 for a while.
[00:25:23.135 --> 00:25:26.997]  They actually publicly said, shift your anger onto Saddam.
[00:25:27.117 --> 00:25:27.737]  He did it.
[00:25:28.377 --> 00:25:29.458]  Saddam is the man.
[00:25:29.558 --> 00:25:33.060]  And Bush would even on purpose go, bin Laden, I mean Saddam.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:38.662]  And then after they were done with Iraq, at least the invasion, they switched back to Al-Qaeda.
[00:25:39.403 --> 00:25:42.004]  And so they backed off saying Al-Qaeda is going to get us.
[00:25:42.664 --> 00:25:44.165]  A, because people started seeing through it.
[00:25:44.325 --> 00:25:48.827]  Even major polls showed that people were saying that they were using terror alerts for political gain.
[00:25:50.566 --> 00:25:59.329]  So the public understands that they're, even if they don't think the government did it, they know the government's using it to take our freedoms and to politically, you know, shut the opposition up.
[00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:03.291]  But that's why exposing government sponsors is so important.
[00:26:03.971 --> 00:26:13.375]  A lot of people, even in the Patriot movement, or the quote, Ron Polk type movement, go, okay, 9-11's an inside job, but let's not discuss it or talk about it because it sounds kooky and it scares people.
[00:26:15.106 --> 00:26:29.870]  We better desperately be exposing 9-11 and government-sponsored terror, because if we don't, Hillary or whoever else is going to come into office, and guaranteed have some type of inaugural terror attack, so that they can firmly bring in their next wave of control.
[00:26:30.411 --> 00:26:38.293]  I mean, we have the sword of Damocles hanging over our head every day, where the globalists could pull the stops out and do this.
[00:26:39.318 --> 00:26:42.059]  And that we have to continue to expose government-sponsored terror.
[00:26:42.139 --> 00:26:43.540]  That is the key.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:44.900]  Out of everything.
[00:26:45.541 --> 00:26:52.264]  So what you're saying is that it's a Catch-22 situation, kind of, because if Hillary wins, she'll probably stage something.
[00:26:52.744 --> 00:27:04.669]  And if Ron Paul wins, the secret controllers will most likely stage something as well and force him into the position where he'll have to point at somebody else, like a ghost enemy.
[00:27:05.225 --> 00:27:07.246]  Because he doesn't want to look like the one that did it.
[00:27:07.606 --> 00:27:12.108]  You know, we voted for him, and he really is the people's candidate.
[00:27:13.068 --> 00:27:14.689]  You know, I mean, he has our interest at heart.
[00:27:14.709 --> 00:27:15.489]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:27:15.529 --> 00:27:16.429]  Justice be done.
[00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:17.390]  Justice be done.
[00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:18.270]  I appreciate your call.
[00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:19.711]  May the heavens fall.
[00:27:20.511 --> 00:27:23.952]  And so, no doubt, that's a very astute point you make.
[00:27:24.333 --> 00:27:30.135]  If Ron Paul was a good elected president and they weren't to assassinate him because they decided that was too dangerous to do,
[00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.671]  They would try to manufacture dirt on him.
[00:27:34.631 --> 00:27:37.892]  They would try to crash the economy and say that he had caused it.
[00:27:39.052 --> 00:27:44.314]  They would probably have American hostages taken and then say Ron Paul's foreign policy caused it.
[00:27:45.254 --> 00:27:49.095]  They would sick some foreign ne'er-do-well group under the control of a globalist on them.
[00:27:49.855 --> 00:27:54.137]  And yes, they could certainly stage terror attacks and say that Ron Paul had caused it.
[00:27:54.497 --> 00:27:58.378]  He wouldn't let us fight him over there, so we got attacked over here.
[00:28:00.137 --> 00:28:13.220]  That's why they're going to continue to hold us hostage with staged events until everybody understands that government-sponsored terror has happened in the past, has happened recently, and can happen again.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.000]  It is their ace in the hole.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.681]  It is the pivot on which their entire system orbits.
[00:28:21.281 --> 00:28:26.242]  And, you know, the crowd that doesn't want to talk about 9-11 being an inside job, they don't want to talk about Tonkin being staged.
[00:28:27.663 --> 00:28:29.103]  To get us into Vietnam, that's admitted.
[00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:36.695]  They don't talk about all the hundreds of admissions, and they don't understand the larger globalist strategy.
[00:28:37.736 --> 00:28:55.889]  If it does not become a household understanding that the government is criminal and run by criminals, it doesn't mean the whole government is criminal, but the leadership and the directors of the agencies and the financial institutions that have put those people in power and lobbied themselves into control.
[00:28:57.586 --> 00:28:59.668]  They're going to continue to have their way with us.
[00:29:01.629 --> 00:29:06.353]  They're already saying, SPP, we've got to have the SPP, North American Union for Security.
[00:29:07.774 --> 00:29:11.256]  But then you look at what the SPP does, it actually destroys border security.
[00:29:11.617 --> 00:29:13.898]  They know, though, the average person can't grasp that.
[00:29:14.499 --> 00:29:15.720]  It isn't about logic.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.442]  And so when there's another terror attack, they're going to say, see?
[00:29:19.142 --> 00:29:20.724]  We've got to have the SPP.
[00:29:21.224 --> 00:29:22.505]  And that's a talking point.
[00:29:24.246 --> 00:29:25.127]  On Nightline,
[00:29:26.329 --> 00:29:40.681]  The Wednesday after 9-11, Wednesday week, eight days later, I saw the head of United Nations Peacekeeping, General McKenzie, say, we need a continental security perimeter from southern Mexico to Alaska.
[00:29:40.721 --> 00:29:41.562]  That's what we're going to do.
[00:29:41.982 --> 00:29:43.123]  That's what we're putting in place.
[00:29:44.704 --> 00:29:45.125]  You see?
[00:29:45.645 --> 00:29:48.207]  And then now that's what the CFR proposes years later.
[00:29:48.568 --> 00:29:49.328]  This is a plan.
[00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.951]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.391 --> 00:29:54.913]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.908 --> 00:29:58.810]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.872 --> 00:30:04.814]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:30:04.974 --> 00:30:10.218]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:30:10.498 --> 00:30:15.822]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:16.222 --> 00:30:17.303]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:17.683 --> 00:30:26.751]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:30:27.011 --> 00:30:28.632]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[00:31:02.342 --> 00:31:02.743]  Attention!
[00:31:02.863 --> 00:31:05.667]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[00:31:05.968 --> 00:31:10.274]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:31:10.595 --> 00:31:11.296]  Listen closely.
[00:31:11.937 --> 00:31:17.585]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful
[00:31:17.585 --> 00:31:17.925]  I think so.
[00:31:34.554 --> 00:31:44.019]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[00:31:44.199 --> 00:31:49.842]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[00:31:50.042 --> 00:31:53.604]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[00:31:53.844 --> 00:31:57.185]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[00:32:02.206 --> 00:32:04.047]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:32:04.187 --> 00:32:09.370]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:10.891]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:32:11.151 --> 00:32:19.316]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:32:19.536 --> 00:32:25.340]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.201]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:32:27.301 --> 00:32:29.402]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:32:29.582 --> 00:32:33.827]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:32:33.987 --> 00:32:36.150]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:43.999]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:44.960]  We're good to go.
[00:33:14.068 --> 00:33:17.150]  I have studied psychology in a late fashion.
[00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:31.801]  And what we don't want our movement to be is soft, and weak, and knock-kneed, and slow, and timid.
[00:33:32.602 --> 00:33:35.924]  We need to be bold, well-spoken, forceful, and have the evidence.
[00:33:38.166 --> 00:33:41.288]  I mean, if you knew that criminal elements of the government killed 2,800 people,
[00:33:43.365 --> 00:33:46.486]  And you knew they'd done it hundreds of times in the past and then it was declassified.
[00:33:50.106 --> 00:33:50.747]  You would do that.
[00:33:52.787 --> 00:33:53.527]  You would speak out.
[00:33:53.787 --> 00:33:54.467]  You would be bold.
[00:33:55.828 --> 00:34:02.449]  I mean, you almost become a member of the criminal operation.
[00:34:02.469 --> 00:34:05.970]  They're aiding and abetting.
[00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:10.611]  You are an accomplice to the crime after the fact.
[00:34:12.043 --> 00:34:18.067]  When you know that it's an inside job, or you know the evidence points towards it being an inside job, and you self-censor.
[00:34:19.028 --> 00:34:22.310]  And you also bring doom down on your own head.
[00:34:24.511 --> 00:34:29.094]  You know, they tell people in campaigns, be timid, don't be bold, don't be focused, don't attack.
[00:34:30.515 --> 00:34:35.579]  And then the establishment candidates, they do attack, and they are vicious, because that's what's effective.
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:41.783]  But they then give you a strategy that is ineffective in your daily life.
[00:34:44.364 --> 00:35:06.496]  And so I am going to boldly expose 9-11, and I'm going to boldly, if I've got hundreds of mainstream news stories and government documents about cancer viruses and vaccines, or the vaccines causing Crohn's disease and literally scores of other autoimmune problems in the intestines, upper and lower, small and large, I'm going to talk about it.
[00:35:07.277 --> 00:35:11.299]  And if AIDS is an engineered bioweapon and we have all the documents, I don't care if it's shocking,
[00:35:12.142 --> 00:35:13.183]  I don't care if it's scary.
[00:35:13.543 --> 00:35:15.604]  I don't care if the cowardly public can't handle it.
[00:35:15.964 --> 00:35:17.845]  I'm going to talk about it until they can handle it.
[00:35:20.847 --> 00:35:21.467]  It's real simple.
[00:35:23.949 --> 00:35:30.012]  I mean, it sounds crazy that the average state has more than two-thirds of their foster children on seven psychotropic drugs.
[00:35:30.893 --> 00:35:35.815]  Not just an average of more than two-thirds on drugs, but more than seven drugs, or seven drugs is the average.
[00:35:37.296 --> 00:35:38.637]  Sounds crazy, but it's the truth.
[00:35:39.733 --> 00:35:42.576]  Just like when I told you about glow-in-the-dark monkeys.
[00:35:43.196 --> 00:35:45.578]  Six years ago, and you couldn't believe me, now it's all over the news.
[00:35:45.959 --> 00:35:47.920]  Glow-in-the-dark monkeys, glow-in-the-dark cats.
[00:35:48.341 --> 00:35:52.484]  Everybody's emailing me, oh, talk about the glow-in-the-dark monkeys and cats.
[00:35:53.605 --> 00:35:54.867]  You know, people called me kooks.
[00:35:54.907 --> 00:35:59.090]  How many radio shows made fun of me about that just because I read the news wire?
[00:36:01.793 --> 00:36:03.995]  And went online to Hong Kong shops.
[00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:17.800]  And look at the glowing monkeys that I could buy, and have shipped to me by the way, that are just spawning super viruses and bacteria literally just coming off of them.
[00:36:19.142 --> 00:36:27.830]  And the establishment knows that when all of that breaks out, they just label it as all these new diseases and then they've got the treatment for it.
[00:36:29.201 --> 00:36:30.902]  And that doesn't mean the average doctor does.
[00:36:31.062 --> 00:36:34.685]  He or she is compartmentalized and carries out the AMA approved treatment.
[00:36:35.005 --> 00:36:43.150]  I mean, you better figure out the diabolic nature, the dark philosophy, or the dark mathematics of the New World Order.
[00:36:44.431 --> 00:36:45.291]  They are records.
[00:36:45.832 --> 00:36:53.557]  And I've told the story about this down in Cornwall in southern England, on the seacoast there, on the white cliffs of Dover nearby.
[00:36:54.429 --> 00:37:17.684]  They would, for hundreds of years, this goes back over 800 years, would put up fires at night, guide fires at night, knowing that Spanish and French and Viking ships, and then Dutch 500 years ago, 400 years ago, we're going back 800 years ago, and they would come in and wreck on the rocks
[00:37:19.344 --> 00:37:29.386]  And then they would set the fires where they knew that it would bring the goods in to the shore, or near the shore, and they would go out and they would salvage that.
[00:37:29.406 --> 00:37:38.608]  And when you actually read some of the riddles and sayings that are admittedly from skull and bones, it's about how they're wreckers.
[00:37:40.608 --> 00:37:43.849]  I didn't know exactly what that meant until I read history books the last four or five years.
[00:37:43.889 --> 00:37:46.369]  I kind of, the last six years, got into naval history.
[00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:48.870]  Not just the Napoleonic Wars, but
[00:37:51.024 --> 00:37:53.025]  1776, the American-British War.
[00:37:53.045 --> 00:37:57.568]  And I went back and read a lot of history before that.
[00:37:58.529 --> 00:38:00.070]  And they had wreckers in ancient Greece.
[00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:01.251]  They had wreckers in Egypt.
[00:38:01.831 --> 00:38:02.892]  They had wreckers everywhere.
[00:38:02.932 --> 00:38:06.294]  And see, that's just one little example of their philosophy.
[00:38:07.435 --> 00:38:10.957]  They come in and put cancer viruses in your vaccine, poisons in your water.
[00:38:12.398 --> 00:38:14.720]  They create hundreds of new diseases every decade.
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:16.601]  Then they have treatments for them.
[00:38:19.537 --> 00:38:23.139]  that don't cure you, but only treat the symptoms.
[00:38:27.242 --> 00:38:36.047]  And if we don't have a new renaissance, a revelation of just how serious things are, then we're going to have watered-down movements that are easily co-opted.
[00:38:36.828 --> 00:38:43.972]  And with this huge background shatter of thousands of radio stations and hundreds of TV stations and more at it every day,
[00:38:46.465 --> 00:38:53.628]  Only someone who tells it like it is, and again, I don't have words to describe how serious all this is.
[00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:57.649]  I can't have all the knowledge about this.
[00:38:57.689 --> 00:39:09.353]  Just what I know is so unspeakably dark and wicked, and yes, hard to believe when it's in their own documents, that I couldn't put it as bad as it actually is to you.
[00:39:11.914 --> 00:39:13.975]  Billy in Chicago, you're on the air.
[00:39:15.299 --> 00:39:29.554]  Alex, I just want to tell you first hand that I took your advice about not waiting for orders from the top and started my own website, started producing my own videos, and the response has been overwhelming.
[00:39:29.574 --> 00:39:31.977]  I was starting to average 10,000 hits a month.
[00:39:32.638 --> 00:39:37.323]  Rosie O'Donnell picked up one of my videos, put it on her blog, Air America.
[00:39:38.041 --> 00:39:47.329]  And the response has just been nuts, and I've been going up talking to people directly, and people that have been staunch Bush supporters are finally even seeing the light.
[00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:54.135]  A friend of mine, who basically was going to go down with the ship, said to me a couple days ago, this guy needs to be impeached.
[00:39:54.496 --> 00:40:00.080]  The big problem is, though, a lot of people are jumping over to the Democrats, or they're jumping over to other candidates.
[00:40:00.341 --> 00:40:04.024]  Every one of them is controlled opposition, except for Ron Paul.
[00:40:05.123 --> 00:40:07.245]  Well, and people are waking up to that.
[00:40:07.566 --> 00:40:10.549]  They're just watching these people on TV and they're just like, they're liars.
[00:40:11.049 --> 00:40:18.156]  And if people would just realize, if they can get through the fear and choose love over fear, watch something like the battle at Kruger.
[00:40:18.877 --> 00:40:22.761]  Realize that the people have the power and we're the ones that are going to make the changes here.
[00:40:23.548 --> 00:40:25.290]  And the establishment knows that.
[00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:35.959]  That's why they say Bin Laden attacked us because he hates our freedom, but then they do everything they can to take our freedoms and all the mechanisms they've built are for suppressing us.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:38.761]  Absolutely.
[00:40:39.121 --> 00:40:39.602]  Absolutely.
[00:40:39.762 --> 00:40:44.806]  And I sit in my office and every week I look down on the street here, there's a police checkpoint.
[00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:51.522]  At least once a week, where there's seven squad cars and they're checking people for, you know, allegedly for seatbelts, papers, please.
[00:40:51.542 --> 00:40:53.464]  But if they're illegal aliens, they're let go.
[00:40:53.524 --> 00:40:54.985]  Citizens have the book thrown at them.
[00:40:55.486 --> 00:40:56.046]  Absolutely.
[00:40:56.226 --> 00:40:59.329]  And they reach in and check the ashtray for roaches.
[00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:03.213]  For those who don't know, that's the butt of a marijuana cigarette.
[00:41:04.257 --> 00:41:09.223]  Uh, and, uh, it's just a... while their bosses ship in the narcotics.
[00:41:09.283 --> 00:41:18.753]  I mean, and while their bosses push, again, Ritalin and Prozac type drugs whose molecules are more deadly than the illegal narcotics.
[00:41:19.434 --> 00:41:22.437]  And the point I've been making to people is, like, when I'm talking to them, I'm like,
[00:41:22.876 --> 00:41:30.902]  Okay, so you agree with me that Christine Todd Whitman lied, Giuliani lied about the air quality in New York, and... And by the way, that's going to kill more people than 9-11.
[00:41:31.022 --> 00:41:31.562]  Go ahead.
[00:41:31.843 --> 00:41:34.885]  Sure, and police, firemen, and citizens of New York are dying.
[00:41:35.205 --> 00:41:42.290]  You believe the story about Walter Reed and the investors and how they're treating our vets when they're coming back, and the homeless vet situation.
[00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:44.472]  And we've had over 15,000 troops die.
[00:41:44.572 --> 00:41:46.213]  The Pentagon admits that.
[00:41:46.673 --> 00:41:53.820]  But only 4,000 that have died in-country, so they don't count those that die from having their arms and legs blown off a week later.
[00:41:54.701 --> 00:41:55.161]  Exactly.
[00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:59.285]  So what's funny is I keep citing these things, and they agree, and they go, you know what, you're right, you're right.
[00:41:59.545 --> 00:42:07.533]  And I go, so why is it so hard for you to believe that they would fly planes into buildings and kill us that way if they're doing it all these other ways?
[00:42:08.416 --> 00:42:15.922]  Well, that's the point I make, and that's what Endgame does, is we spend 20 minutes of the two-hour, 20-minute film, literally 30 seconds apiece.
[00:42:16.342 --> 00:42:19.024]  Okay, here's London Guardian.
[00:42:19.925 --> 00:42:23.527]  Deadly bioweapons sprayed over entirety of England.
[00:42:23.627 --> 00:42:24.768]  Massive deaths occurred.
[00:42:25.289 --> 00:42:28.991]  And they did it hundreds of times just in that one experiment.
[00:42:30.052 --> 00:42:32.534]  Oh, here, deadly plague bombs set off in Scotland.
[00:42:33.375 --> 00:42:34.336]  Oh, here's another one.
[00:42:34.816 --> 00:42:37.957]  I mean, I use this example because it's the most horrific of all of them.
[00:42:38.318 --> 00:42:42.080]  Taking toddlers, putting them in a radiation tank, and flying them?
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.360]  Oh, but they wouldn't!
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.321]  And that's admitted!
[00:42:44.621 --> 00:42:46.622]  That's Time and Newsweek, folks!
[00:42:47.902 --> 00:42:50.544]  I mean, you know, flying babies, folks!
[00:42:51.544 --> 00:42:52.205]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:42:53.165 --> 00:42:53.925]  Well, that's all I'm saying.
[00:42:53.965 --> 00:43:01.029]  So I'm just making the challenge to everybody just to... The only way things are going to change is if you get out there and get active.
[00:43:01.605 --> 00:43:12.050]  And whether that's just talking to people, or campaigning for Ron Paul, or starting a website, or making videos, or just handing out information, or directing them to your site, that's what's going to make the change.
[00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:14.411]  We are the ones we have been waiting for.
[00:43:14.431 --> 00:43:14.891]  I agree.
[00:43:14.931 --> 00:43:16.352]  Why don't you plug your website?
[00:43:16.592 --> 00:43:17.192]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:43:17.272 --> 00:43:26.136]  It's Puppetgov.com, and we've got links to you, and we cite you in a lot of the videos.
[00:43:26.216 --> 00:43:27.917]  Hey, brother, I don't even care if you do.
[00:43:27.977 --> 00:43:29.338]  All I care is that you find the new old order.
[00:43:29.358 --> 00:43:30.238]  God bless you, and take care.
[00:43:32.915 --> 00:43:34.976]  You know, I start thinking about it.
[00:43:36.596 --> 00:43:39.477]  The New World Order is best described as vampires.
[00:43:40.317 --> 00:43:55.121]  Now, before the New York Times misquotes me and says I believe in vampires, I mean, they don't have fangs that come out at night, and they don't turn into bats and flap around, and they, well, at Skull and Bones they do sleep in coffins, but they literally fit the M.O.
[00:43:55.161 --> 00:43:55.861]  of vampires.
[00:43:56.061 --> 00:43:58.202]  I mean, they have no remorse.
[00:43:58.282 --> 00:43:59.882]  In fact, they enjoy killing us.
[00:44:01.063 --> 00:44:02.183]  They see us as cattle.
[00:44:03.726 --> 00:44:04.947]  They see us as a disease.
[00:44:04.967 --> 00:44:15.214]  They're selling the world through environmentalism, false environmentalism, that humans are bad and setting a precedent to tax all of our daily activities, micromanage our lives.
[00:44:17.616 --> 00:44:18.316]  They mean business!
[00:44:20.838 --> 00:44:24.861]  Meanwhile, they are literally doing everything they can to destroy the Earth.
[00:44:26.022 --> 00:44:30.645]  I mean, again, I don't know how many top scientists we've talked to, how many mainstream articles I've even read, but they don't get any attention.
[00:44:31.932 --> 00:44:52.467]  Where they're saying super viruses are already out there, things are already being leaked, there are hundreds of thousands of known viruses that have come out of genetically engineered crops and animals and organisms that just haven't jumped into humans yet that are killing trees, and killing fish, and killing birds, and killing deer, and some of the stuff has jumped into humans and then they whitewash it.
[00:44:52.847 --> 00:44:55.649]  I mean, we're living in a science fiction nightmare.
[00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:59.112]  And all I know is I love my family and I care about you too.
[00:45:00.191 --> 00:45:11.413]  You know, you see the stories all the time about some toddler walks out in the street and some man jumps in front of a bus to save them, or firemen go into a burning house to save children, and the firemen die, but the kids get out.
[00:45:11.433 --> 00:45:14.094]  You know, it's that same instinct.
[00:45:14.134 --> 00:45:15.294]  I mean, I just have an instinct.
[00:45:15.874 --> 00:45:17.455]  I see other people's children as mine.
[00:45:17.515 --> 00:45:19.435]  I have an instinctive tribal thing.
[00:45:19.715 --> 00:45:21.596]  I see my fellow man as my tribe.
[00:45:22.156 --> 00:45:24.996]  And then I realize that the establishment's taken that out of most people.
[00:45:26.337 --> 00:45:27.437]  They've gone to most people,
[00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:31.672]  And they have trained them to hate their fellow man, to be cheats.
[00:45:34.473 --> 00:45:51.942]  And I heard a talk show host this weekend, George Butler on Genesis, talking about how, and he was absolutely right, that college today is about who dresses the best and who can pay the money to have somebody write their papers for them.
[00:45:56.724 --> 00:46:00.087]  And then they just, and it's just screw jobs everywhere.
[00:46:01.528 --> 00:46:05.411]  And everything's starting to unravel, and everything is about the surface.
[00:46:06.232 --> 00:46:08.614]  And people rationalize what they're doing.
[00:46:10.375 --> 00:46:24.206]  So it's not just the New World Order, it's the general public is either getting smarter, better, more enlightened, more virtuous, or you're getting more evil.
[00:46:25.455 --> 00:46:32.701]  I mean, who would have ever thought they'd be on television promoting torture, promoting secret arrest, promoting NSA spying on everyone?
[00:46:33.401 --> 00:46:45.330]  The New York Times comes right out and tells you what I've been telling you for 12 years, since 1996 yesterday, and says, yeah, the government's paying billions to telecoms to put in more snooping systems in their telephone companies.
[00:46:45.711 --> 00:46:47.372]  I mean, whole floors at every facility.
[00:46:48.132 --> 00:46:49.373]  I knew that from the legislation.
[00:46:51.435 --> 00:46:52.636]  Now they're just putting in another layer.
[00:46:53.556 --> 00:47:06.138]  And then it's big breaking news when somebody in San Francisco, one of their IT top guys, talks about how a whole floor was built by the NSA, and how everything runs through it, and how they spy on everything.
[00:47:08.639 --> 00:47:09.779]  Everybody's so shocked.
[00:47:09.919 --> 00:47:11.159]  I mean, it was in the bill!
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:20.261]  It has nothing to do with terrorists, except for when the military or the FBI would try to stop
[00:47:21.008 --> 00:47:28.416]  The Patsy's who were going around taking part in drills, and they didn't know, they thought it was actual terrorists on 9-11, they could be ordered to stand down.
[00:47:28.496 --> 00:47:43.831]  FBI agents are on record in a bunch of news articles, but one headline in the London Guardian, let me paraphrase, about five years ago, it was a top FBI deputy anti-terrorism director was saying, and John O'Neill before they killed him said this too, they said it's like
[00:47:44.725 --> 00:47:48.807]  Al-Qaeda has moles at the highest levels of the FBI and CIA.
[00:47:48.887 --> 00:47:49.827]  No, you got that wrong.
[00:47:50.347 --> 00:47:51.408]  It isn't moles.
[00:47:51.828 --> 00:47:52.848]  That's who runs it.
[00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:57.670]  So the FBI agents on the ground are going, it's like they got moles at the top!
[00:47:58.271 --> 00:48:00.171]  And they tell us not to go after these people!
[00:48:00.992 --> 00:48:01.732]  Absolutely!
[00:48:02.152 --> 00:48:02.892]  Bingo!
[00:48:03.453 --> 00:48:04.093]  Bingo!
[00:48:07.294 --> 00:48:08.555]  Let's go to Frank in Georgia.
[00:48:08.595 --> 00:48:11.636]  Thanks for holding them, Nathan, Richard, Dino, and others.
[00:48:11.676 --> 00:48:12.216]  Go ahead, Frank.
[00:48:13.417 --> 00:48:13.697]  Hey, man.
[00:48:14.727 --> 00:48:30.670]  I just want to say about Ron Paul, like, you guys have done a good job of getting everybody to donate and everything, and now you have all these people that are not only emotionally vested in this campaign, but now you have people who have never been financially vested, who are financially vested.
[00:48:31.771 --> 00:48:39.212]  But, uh, I mean, I really think, you know, these people, they're not gonna, they don't relinquish their power, they just pass it around.
[00:48:39.972 --> 00:48:43.113]  And so, it's not, you know, if there's an event, it's just when.
[00:48:44.088 --> 00:49:01.679]  And I think that really, like Romney and Giuliani and all those other guys need to worry about being, you know, caught up in some sort of event that eliminates Ron Paul along with them so that they can really wash their hands of it and say, no, we didn't do it.
[00:49:04.101 --> 00:49:09.124]  And then they can install, you know, Jeb Bush to run against Hillary, which is what they'd really love.
[00:49:09.364 --> 00:49:11.366]  Yeah, there's no telling what they can pull.
[00:49:11.406 --> 00:49:11.986]  There's no telling.
[00:49:12.006 --> 00:49:13.327]  There's no telling, for sure.
[00:49:14.494 --> 00:49:28.324]  But, um, I just, you know, if something is pulled, now that you have all these people who are also financially vested, you have to, I mean, you're also always talking about how you don't want anybody doing anything offensive, you know?
[00:49:28.705 --> 00:49:32.267]  We have to have a defensive attack, you know, like you say.
[00:49:33.749 --> 00:49:36.531]  Well, by offensive, I mean physically offensive.
[00:49:37.171 --> 00:49:39.433]  We need to be on the offensive in the info war.
[00:49:41.677 --> 00:49:52.559]  I'm just saying, you know, if something does happen, you don't want these people who are first time in, you know, financially invested in the campaign really thinking, taking it personally on their $50 and saying, well, I'm going to do something now.
[00:49:53.799 --> 00:49:57.380]  You know, just because everybody's all pumped up and fired up, you still don't have to be smart about it.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.720]  Yeah, because the establishment will use that as an excuse for a crackdown.
[00:50:01.601 --> 00:50:02.521]  But what about that?
[00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:04.801]  You know, I guess, you know, yeah, they can do anything.
[00:50:06.641 --> 00:50:08.902]  Not if we expose government-sponsored terror.
[00:50:08.962 --> 00:50:09.862]  Not if we explain
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.722]  Hey, I'm going to read two paragraphs from
[00:50:36.332 --> 00:50:36.852]  Well, stay there.
[00:50:36.872 --> 00:50:38.072]  I'll let you come back to it real fast.
[00:50:38.392 --> 00:50:40.273]  Then I've got Nathan, Richard, Dino, and others.
[00:50:40.613 --> 00:50:45.335]  I've got a bunch of audio clips, more of your calls, a ton of news I haven't even gotten to yet that I want to cover.
[00:50:45.835 --> 00:50:49.916]  So I'll try to hurry up your phones a little bit faster on the other side.
[00:50:51.657 --> 00:50:55.698]  And you can still give somebody at PrisonPlanet.tv membership for Christmas.
[00:50:56.799 --> 00:50:59.760]  It's not too late to get five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:01.832 --> 00:51:03.252]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:04.313 --> 00:51:05.373]  A New World Order.
[00:51:06.073 --> 00:51:10.315]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:10.975 --> 00:51:12.735]  It's known as the Builder Birth.
[00:51:13.796 --> 00:51:16.036]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:16.577 --> 00:51:19.037]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:19.758 --> 00:51:27.120]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:35.112]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.553 --> 00:51:39.035]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.255 --> 00:51:41.937]  Build America is making great progress for the world government.
[00:51:41.997 --> 00:51:43.138]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.158 --> 00:51:43.878]  They're not after money.
[00:51:43.898 --> 00:51:44.999]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.219 --> 00:51:45.980]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.220]  That's what they're after, you see.
[00:51:47.361 --> 00:51:51.884]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:51:58.868 --> 00:51:59.909]  You have been warned.
[00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:03.772]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:04.092 --> 00:52:09.016]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.276 --> 00:52:13.619]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:13.919 --> 00:52:22.826]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.046 --> 00:52:26.649]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:26.949 --> 00:52:31.978]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.279 --> 00:52:39.031]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:39.512 --> 00:52:40.053]  What about you?
[00:52:40.783 --> 00:52:45.687]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.

[00:53:00.532 --> 00:53:02.014]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.
[00:53:02.354 --> 00:53:07.860]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:53:08.341 --> 00:53:16.290]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[00:53:16.791 --> 00:53:20.415]  The package contains 6 DVDs that contain 10 different programs.
[00:53:20.755 --> 00:53:21.135]  We're good.
[00:53:50.621 --> 00:53:54.324]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:53:55.164 --> 00:53:59.247]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:54:02.689 --> 00:54:07.833]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.513 --> 00:54:10.855]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:10.875 --> 00:54:18.480]  Alright, Frank and George, finish up quick.
[00:54:19.737 --> 00:54:32.480]  So this is Noam Chomsky on a speech that he gave talking about how the war on terror should be reported if it was truly being reported objectively.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:38.261]  And it's called The Journalist for Mars, and it's, you know, if somebody from Mars came down here, how would they really report on it?
[00:54:38.862 --> 00:54:42.182]  So he says, the first thing you have to do is define terrorism.
[00:54:42.822 --> 00:54:49.124]  It says, terrorism, as I'm quoting, is defined as calculated use of violence or the threat of violence.
[00:54:49.585 --> 00:54:57.327]  To attain goals that are political, religious, or ideological in nature, through intimidation, coercion, or installation of fear.
[00:54:57.347 --> 00:55:01.628]  And it says, well, you know, that sounds all good and everything, but there's two reasons why you can't.
[00:55:02.248 --> 00:55:06.790]  And the first one is, the official definition is unusable.
[00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:09.150]  It's unusable for two important reasons.
[00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:13.932]  First of all, it's a very close paraphrase of official government policy.
[00:55:14.392 --> 00:55:15.332]  Very close, in fact.
[00:55:16.717 --> 00:55:20.939]  Yeah, if you don't do what we say, we're going to hurt you.
[00:55:21.879 --> 00:55:22.059]  Right.
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:23.840]  But that's Chomsky.
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:25.101]  That's Sam Stanislaus himself.
[00:55:25.161 --> 00:55:26.682]  I just figured I'd let him get that out there.
[00:55:26.962 --> 00:55:27.823]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[00:55:28.563 --> 00:55:30.664]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nathan in Pennsylvania.
[00:55:30.684 --> 00:55:31.284]  You're on the air.
[00:55:31.304 --> 00:55:31.344]  Hi.
[00:55:33.165 --> 00:55:33.446]  Hello.
[00:55:33.846 --> 00:55:34.826]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[00:55:35.187 --> 00:55:35.847]  Thanks for calling.
[00:55:36.367 --> 00:55:36.527]  Yep.
[00:55:37.308 --> 00:55:40.810]  I got a couple questions for you about your headlines today, but first I'd like to say
[00:55:42.057 --> 00:55:48.300]  I actually was on Ritalin when I was younger and I gotta say that is definitely messed up for kids.
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:56:02.926]  I was misdiagnosed and what they do is they have a practice of if you don't like the Ritalin and you tell them that you don't like it and you don't like the way it feels, they literally have a system set up so that they just up your dose.
[00:56:03.526 --> 00:56:06.168]  So if you don't like what they're giving you, they just give you more.
[00:56:07.208 --> 00:56:09.289]  And then they tell you, you know, you'll feel good with this.
[00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:11.410]  It's the same thing with the Prozac drugs.
[00:56:12.317 --> 00:56:18.899]  Yeah, well, so I started on 50 milligrams and by the time I just stopped taking it, I mean, I just stopped taking it because it's bad.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:25.302]  But, um, I started on 50 and by the time I stopped that was like, I started on 5 and by the time I stopped that was up to like 50 milligrams.
[00:56:25.522 --> 00:56:34.305]  But, um, another question I have for you is, um, something really weird happened while my friends and I were watching the Money Bomb.
[00:56:35.325 --> 00:56:37.166]  It was midnight Eastern Time, well, actually it was 1155.
[00:56:38.727 --> 00:56:43.028]  And within the last five minutes, we were counting down to see if Ron Paul could hit $18 million.
[00:56:44.808 --> 00:56:45.249]  He was at $17,980,000.
[00:56:45.409 --> 00:56:46.789]  And then my computer had a little glitch.
[00:56:46.809 --> 00:56:51.070]  So we got back on the internet, and we looked at the countdown again, and he had lost $30,000.
[00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:51.370]  It was at $17,960,000.
[00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:53.351]  So I just chalked that up to a technical problem with the counter.
[00:56:53.371 --> 00:56:55.331]  But I was wondering if you had any comments about that.
[00:57:09.958 --> 00:57:12.702]  No, we know he got 6.6 million in one day.
[00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:14.345]  Yeah, okay, okay.
[00:57:14.946 --> 00:57:16.268]  And you had a comment about headlines?
[00:57:16.688 --> 00:57:17.470]  Yeah, the headlines.
[00:57:18.231 --> 00:57:23.799]  This Rand Paul, the fear that some of the votes might be given away to the other
[00:57:25.007 --> 00:57:27.168]  These are the other candidates for his father?
[00:57:27.268 --> 00:57:27.528]  Yes.
[00:57:27.628 --> 00:57:30.948]  I was wondering what you think Ron Paul might do about that, if that happens.
[00:57:30.968 --> 00:57:34.909]  Because I noticed that most candidates... Yeah, most candidates won't contest.
[00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:43.271]  That's why we need poll watchers now, and people who are election workers now, to oversee all this, to make sure there's not chicanery.
[00:57:43.311 --> 00:57:49.713]  Now, you can't tell when it's an electronic machine, but places like New Hampshire, quote, paper ballot, they still feed it into a computer.
[00:57:50.933 --> 00:57:53.314]  So, there's a lot of things we can do.
[00:57:53.374 --> 00:57:54.194]  I appreciate your call.
[00:57:54.969 --> 00:57:55.749]  Here's an example.
[00:57:55.989 --> 00:57:59.191]  In 1996, Pat Buchanan was running in the Republican primaries.
[00:58:00.131 --> 00:58:02.773]  I was working downtown at the Austin Convention Center.
[00:58:04.213 --> 00:58:05.354]  It had a different name then.
[00:58:05.374 --> 00:58:07.375]  They'd torn it down and built a bigger building.
[00:58:07.895 --> 00:58:08.855]  Palmer Events Center.
[00:58:08.915 --> 00:58:09.315]  I forget.
[00:58:09.375 --> 00:58:10.616]  One of those big buildings downtown.
[00:58:12.057 --> 00:58:12.777]  That part doesn't matter.
[00:58:12.797 --> 00:58:13.677]  The point is, I'm down there.
[00:58:14.718 --> 00:58:18.540]  And half of the votes or more were for Pat Buchanan.
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:23.582]  I started asking other people, because we were stacking the scantrons, you can see them right there on the front, that was bubbled in.
[00:58:24.463 --> 00:58:25.723]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:25.743 --> 00:58:26.563]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:57.538 --> 00:58:58.179]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.839 --> 00:58:59.961]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.621 --> 00:59:01.702]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.383 --> 00:59:03.204]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.945 --> 00:59:05.867]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.887 --> 00:59:09.470]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.711 --> 00:59:13.855]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.516 --> 00:59:18.500]  We are now already into hour number two on this live December 18, 2007 edition.
[00:59:22.114 --> 00:59:28.855]  Very thankful for all of our wonderful listeners listening on AM and FM stations, the internet, satellite, and WWCR Global Shortwave.
[00:59:28.875 --> 00:59:35.717]  The show also re-airs over the network and satellites at AM and FM stations and shortwave from 9 to midnight central again.
[00:59:36.377 --> 00:59:44.399]  For those that were curious or miss any of the transmission today, just a footnote, if I sound a little bit out of it today or slow, I am sick.
[00:59:44.459 --> 00:59:44.999]  I have a cold.
[00:59:46.216 --> 00:59:51.140]  But I am here because so much is going on and happening that I just have a fire in the belly to come in and do the show.
[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:52.461]  I love talking to you.
[00:59:52.481 --> 00:59:54.983]  All right, I said I'd take calls today and I've opened phones.
[00:59:55.063 --> 00:59:56.624]  And now I'm going to try to move through your calls quicker.
[00:59:58.225 --> 01:00:03.969]  This hour I'm going to air some Ron Paul clips and a piece about drugging children and how they commit suicide.
[01:00:03.989 --> 01:00:07.252]  We also have some economic news and some police state news.
[01:00:07.272 --> 01:00:10.474]  But right now, let's go to Richard in Texas.
[01:00:10.534 --> 01:00:11.575]  Richard, you are on the air.
[01:00:12.367 --> 01:00:12.847]  Hi Alex.
[01:00:12.888 --> 01:00:13.608]  Two quick things.
[01:00:13.768 --> 01:00:17.351]  One about the Austin Tea Party and another about the JFK assassination.
[01:00:17.431 --> 01:00:31.823]  The Austin Tea Party was a tremendous event this weekend and I just want to encourage people who have been hesitant about getting out in the streets for any action that there are things that are, you know, very safe, very fun, even family-oriented.
[01:00:31.863 --> 01:00:33.384]  And you meet like-minded people.
[01:00:33.424 --> 01:00:34.285]  You meet good friends.
[01:00:34.825 --> 01:00:35.386]  Absolutely.
[01:00:35.406 --> 01:00:51.499]  It was great to see buddies out there and there was probably at least 500 if not a thousand of us and it was just a great day and I think doing those things initially helps to encourage people to see how it's easy to do these street action things and we need, God knows, as much of that as we can get.
[01:00:51.519 --> 01:00:57.303]  And it got TV and radio attention and there were similar rallies across the country, hundreds of them.
[01:00:57.804 --> 01:00:57.984]  Yep.
[01:00:58.945 --> 01:01:04.169]  And it's a good thing and demonstrated a lot of proper views about where we need to head.
[01:01:04.959 --> 01:01:15.887]  Alex, on the JFK assassination, I don't know if you've addressed this, I've not heard you, but recently I've come across a fairly short video on YouTube that shows the Secret Service stand down.
[01:01:16.743 --> 01:01:33.409]  As they approach Dealey Plaza, the Secret Service men being instructed to hop off of the JFK limousine, and showing their frustration and surprise at being given this instruction, opening up basically a line of fire for the assassins.
[01:01:33.509 --> 01:01:37.510]  I knew that had been done, and I've seen photographs of it happening, but you say you have film footage?
[01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:38.670]  Yes, yes.
[01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:41.612]  It's easily Google-able on YouTube.
[01:01:41.972 --> 01:01:48.335]  All you need to type in is SecretServiceStandDownJFK and it'll be the first YouTube option that comes up.
[01:01:48.375 --> 01:01:49.776]  It's only two and a half minutes.
[01:01:49.876 --> 01:01:53.878]  We'll get that posted up on PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com.
[01:01:54.799 --> 01:01:55.339]  Thank you, sir.
[01:01:55.379 --> 01:01:56.359]  I appreciate your call.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.762]  Let's talk to Al in Los Angeles.
[01:02:00.782 --> 01:02:01.202]  Go ahead.
[01:02:03.883 --> 01:02:04.543]  Al just dropped.
[01:02:04.623 --> 01:02:04.944]  Okay.
[01:02:05.944 --> 01:02:07.045]  Sue in Pennsylvania.
[01:02:07.065 --> 01:02:07.545]  You're on the air.
[01:02:08.712 --> 01:02:09.573]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:02:09.613 --> 01:02:11.614]  I have two points I want to go quickly.
[01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:19.681]  It's about a pro-life presence for Ron Paul at the March for Life, January 22nd in D.C.
[01:02:19.701 --> 01:02:22.663]  There's usually 200,000 people there.
[01:02:22.723 --> 01:02:24.084]  Most of them are young people.
[01:02:24.224 --> 01:02:26.466]  I think they could make a real connection to Ron Paul.
[01:02:26.926 --> 01:02:29.308]  Last year, the march was covered with brownback signs.
[01:02:29.809 --> 01:02:32.171]  Obviously, it didn't really get him very far.
[01:02:33.104 --> 01:02:38.465]  We shouldn't let these people default to Huckabee, and we should have a Ron Paul presence at this march.
[01:02:39.366 --> 01:02:42.367]  There's also a poster online that I've never seen before.
[01:02:42.407 --> 01:02:46.288]  It's Ron Paul and Scrubs holding a newborn baby wrapped in the American flag.
[01:02:46.908 --> 01:02:48.748]  You know, the image is worth thousands of words.
[01:02:48.928 --> 01:02:50.669]  Yeah, that's up on my MySpace account.
[01:02:51.409 --> 01:02:55.210]  Yeah, it's awesome that people download that and make their own posters, whatever.
[01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:56.270]  It's very powerful.
[01:02:56.490 --> 01:02:58.031]  You know, there's a lot of imagery.
[01:02:58.051 --> 01:02:59.431]  What did you think of the Money Bomb?
[01:02:59.611 --> 01:03:01.192]  6.6 mil, an all-time record.
[01:03:01.752 --> 01:03:02.052]  Awesome!
[01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:05.871]  What I'm thinking now is that Ron Paul needs a prayer bomb.
[01:03:05.911 --> 01:03:10.673]  We need to storm the heavens for protection of our country and protection of Ron Paul.
[01:03:11.014 --> 01:03:13.835]  Not a gratuitous religiosity like Huckabee,
[01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:19.541]  We really need to pick a day and pray at the state courthouses around the country.
[01:03:20.061 --> 01:03:28.146]  And if people don't think that the New World Order isn't offering prayer and sacrifice to Lucifer against Ron Paul, they don't know what's going on.
[01:03:28.166 --> 01:03:31.708]  This is a battle between light and darkness, and it's time to fight on all fronts.
[01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:32.888]  I agree with you.
[01:03:32.908 --> 01:03:34.309]  Thanks for the call, Sue.
[01:03:34.329 --> 01:03:35.030]  Good to hear from you.
[01:03:35.050 --> 01:03:35.670]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:35.750]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:38.411]  We'll hear what you have to say on the other side.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.300]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.441]  A new world order.
[01:03:58.162 --> 01:04:02.944]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[01:04:03.064 --> 01:04:04.965]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:04:04.985 --> 01:04:08.146]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[01:04:08.667 --> 01:04:11.068]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:11.830 --> 01:04:19.181]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:27.173]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:27.654 --> 01:04:31.116]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:31.516 --> 01:04:33.598]  Build America is making great progress for the world.
[01:04:34.058 --> 01:04:35.219]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:35.239 --> 01:04:36.019]  They're not after money.
[01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:37.100]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:38.061]  They're after power.
[01:04:38.281 --> 01:04:39.121]  That's what they're after.

[01:05:54.562 --> 01:05:59.065]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:05:59.405 --> 01:06:03.488]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:06:03.788 --> 01:06:04.348]  We listened.
[01:06:04.648 --> 01:06:09.631]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:06:09.912 --> 01:06:10.372]  We listened.
[01:06:10.772 --> 01:06:13.816]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:06:14.236 --> 01:06:14.777]  We listened.
[01:06:15.238 --> 01:06:19.302]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:06:19.703 --> 01:06:20.183]  We listened.
[01:06:20.504 --> 01:06:25.750]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:06:26.171 --> 01:06:27.552]  Again, we listened.
[01:06:27.893 --> 01:06:29.434]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[01:06:29.855 --> 01:06:35.260]  Gravity Filter, requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[01:06:42.286 --> 01:06:43.367]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:06:54.369 --> 01:06:56.551]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:57.151 --> 01:06:59.993]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:00.874 --> 01:07:03.235]  Let's continue with Open the Lines today.
[01:07:03.295 --> 01:07:06.077]  Coming up later in the show we're going to play about four different key audio clips.
[01:07:06.097 --> 01:07:07.138]  Three of them of Ron Paul.
[01:07:07.738 --> 01:07:12.201]  Another on the dangers of psychotropic drugs that are trying to push down our children's throats.
[01:07:14.723 --> 01:07:17.565]  Got another report here on Ron Paul that I'm going to
[01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:19.984]  Go ahead and just cover right now.
[01:07:20.004 --> 01:07:22.325]  This is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:07:22.425 --> 01:07:28.689]  Neolibs label record-breaking Ron Paul money bomb abject failure.
[01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:32.091]  Smashing historical fundraising record.
[01:07:32.211 --> 01:07:39.295]  Not enough for Obama sycophants at WONCIT, which has got tens of millions of readers a day.
[01:07:39.775 --> 01:07:43.958]  Neoliberal establishment wannabe ERAG WONCIT and it's
[01:07:45.015 --> 01:07:58.619]  Sycophantic bloggers have dismissed the 2017 Tea Party fundraising event, which set a new campaign record by hauling in a record $6.6 million for Ron Paul's presidential run as an abject failure.
[01:07:59.219 --> 01:08:01.460]  Over 50,000, by the way, small donors.
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:03.880]  That's an all-time record, too.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.581]  It wasn't big money doing this.
[01:08:06.661 --> 01:08:08.361]  Which makes this new record even more amazing.
[01:08:09.062 --> 01:08:14.143]  Last month reported how Swarmy Wonkett, whose writers make a career
[01:08:15.643 --> 01:08:19.447]  Just like Michael Reagan has now said Hillary's better than Ron Paul.
[01:08:19.467 --> 01:08:21.989]  I mean, they're showing their true colors because they have to, folks.
[01:08:40.777 --> 01:08:46.700]  They'll pose as conservatives or liberals as long as they have to, but you get them cornered, they'll show you who they really work for.
[01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:48.041]  Amazing.
[01:08:49.642 --> 01:09:02.969]  Reacting to the Texas Congressional's momentous success over the weekend, Wonka, who maturely referred to Ron Paul supporters as Paul-tards, attempted to scoff at the final amount raised.
[01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:08.472]  I was going to wait until midnight to post the results of December 16th's Paul-tard Moneybox.
[01:09:09.036 --> 01:09:13.799]  But, well, reloading Ron Paul's graph for 15 minutes takes its toll on the old patience.
[01:09:14.339 --> 01:09:22.624]  It appears that the Tea Party, 07, will accrue 6 plus million dollars, breaking the 4.3 million dollar tally from the November 5th money bomb.
[01:09:23.565 --> 01:09:31.510]  The figure was determined by applying advanced algebraic extrapolations to, on the accompanying graph, trend line.
[01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:35.833]  In other words, I look at the line and said, I bet it will end up there.
[01:09:36.013 --> 01:09:36.313]  Okay.
[01:09:37.049 --> 01:09:38.370]  So I'm not a mathematician.
[01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:44.594]  I can, however, determine that $6 million doesn't reach the TARDS $10 million goal.
[01:09:45.755 --> 01:09:48.617]  We had said it'd be nice to have a two-day event and raise $10 million.
[01:09:50.178 --> 01:09:51.719]  Las Vegas said $6 million.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.020]  Two to one, it would hit $6 million.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:54.781]  It hit $6.5 million.
[01:09:54.821 --> 01:09:55.681]  Las Vegas was right.
[01:09:56.722 --> 01:10:02.206]  It goes on to say the poll TARDS won't win the election
[01:10:03.104 --> 01:10:07.465]  So the bomb was, in fact, a bomb, and thousands of people are broke as a result.
[01:10:08.625 --> 01:10:13.226]  So breaking all time records, 6.6 mil in one day, means nothing.
[01:10:13.506 --> 01:10:22.248]  And a bunch of people didn't understand, and gave money after Eastern Time in those two hours that it took to get to the, or the three hours it took to get to Pacific Time.
[01:10:22.628 --> 01:10:23.648]  That was another 200 grand, so really 6.8 mil.
[01:10:23.668 --> 01:10:24.008]  But, you know.
[01:10:28.170 --> 01:10:47.664]  Judging by the fact that this blog post received a paltry seven digs, it seems the only abject failure is the instance in Wonkett's abysmal declaration of war against the Ron Paul campaign, which even with the added support of their drooling neocon attack dogs over at WebState, is falling flat on its face while the Ron Paul revolution soars in popularity.
[01:10:48.044 --> 01:10:50.466]  That's an important article up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:10:50.506 --> 01:10:51.607]  It's also on TruthNews.us.
[01:10:54.111 --> 01:10:56.172]  Start your engines because I'm going to your calls fast.
[01:10:56.573 --> 01:10:58.854]  Florence in Illinois, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:10:59.914 --> 01:11:01.896]  Hi Alex, can you hear me?
[01:11:02.416 --> 01:11:03.056]  Yes I can.
[01:11:03.096 --> 01:11:04.897]  Jim, I'm really honored to talk to you.
[01:11:05.137 --> 01:11:06.178]  I have one question.
[01:11:06.798 --> 01:11:13.402]  What was the document that George Bush signed that's supposed to be effective May 11, 2008?
[01:11:13.462 --> 01:11:14.183]  What does that cover?
[01:11:18.772 --> 01:11:19.573]  May 11, 2008.
[01:11:21.354 --> 01:11:25.497]  I thought there was a document or that's a specific date that I heard over the radio.
[01:11:25.537 --> 01:11:29.820]  I don't know what program, whether it was Jack Blood or what.
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.081]  What was it dealing with?
[01:11:31.641 --> 01:11:34.263]  Well, it was dealing with something like this.
[01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:36.304]  I mean, whether it was a New World Order or what.
[01:11:36.344 --> 01:11:36.765]  I don't know.
[01:11:36.785 --> 01:11:39.466]  Well, let me throw some dates out.
[01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:41.948]  Let me throw some dates out and maybe refresh your memory.
[01:11:42.389 --> 01:11:42.609]  May 9, 2007.
[01:11:42.789 --> 01:11:43.749]  Or six, eight months ago.
[01:11:43.769 --> 01:11:43.830]  Yes.
[01:11:50.208 --> 01:12:05.201]  George Bush signed Presidential Decision Directive 51 in an accompanying executive order stating that Congress is no longer involved in continuity of government, neither are the states, and that effectively the presidency is a dictatorship any time it chooses.
[01:12:05.982 --> 01:12:11.307]  Now, the accompanying legislation had been passed in 2006 for N.O.
[01:12:11.667 --> 01:12:14.530]  708, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, stating
[01:12:15.163 --> 01:12:19.807]  That the entire martial law apparatus is for the American people.
[01:12:19.887 --> 01:12:23.870]  It says for insurrection, revolts, riots by the American people.
[01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:39.903]  So, then, three months ago, in Montebello, Canada, he released it in its public, saying the United Nations will direct the executive branch during a disaster, terror attack, or bio-release, or bio-crisis, even if it was quote, naturally occurring.
[01:12:39.943 --> 01:12:41.764]  It really won't be, in most cases.
[01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:43.886]  But, so,
[01:12:45.049 --> 01:12:48.150]  Everything we always talked about is now happening.
[01:12:48.170 --> 01:12:58.592]  They're now, they're lined up, they've got their engines started, they're on the black line, the checkered flag is swooshing in front of them, the green flag, so who knows what's going to happen.
[01:12:58.972 --> 01:13:01.933]  The point is they are locked and loaded with the gun to our head.
[01:13:03.473 --> 01:13:04.193]  It's pretty sad.
[01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:05.153]  It's pretty sad.
[01:13:05.493 --> 01:13:11.315]  Let me just say that my husband and I have sent out, or are working on, our aim is to give out 200 endgame
[01:13:15.213 --> 01:13:15.674]  Wonderful.
[01:13:15.934 --> 01:13:18.075]  We're working towards the good end.
[01:13:18.435 --> 01:13:21.336]  So, it's just an honor to talk to you, and thank you so much.
[01:13:21.576 --> 01:13:22.636]  Well, let me say this, Florence.
[01:13:22.756 --> 01:13:23.817]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[01:13:24.637 --> 01:13:25.297]  God bless you.
[01:13:25.317 --> 01:13:26.138]  I mean, listen.
[01:13:27.018 --> 01:13:37.102]  I know how many people listen to me, and it is humbling, because I'm just an average person.
[01:13:37.282 --> 01:13:39.363]  I know a lot of you look up to me, but I just know this.
[01:13:39.403 --> 01:13:42.624]  I look up to you, and I look up to all the wonderful things you've done.
[01:13:44.401 --> 01:13:44.881]  Perhaps.
[01:13:46.322 --> 01:13:47.902]  Florence was talking about May 11th.
[01:13:48.523 --> 01:13:52.104]  They claim that the National ID Card, the Real ID Act, kicks in then.
[01:13:52.544 --> 01:13:55.185]  Then there's talk about the states, 30 plus states, revolting.
[01:13:55.585 --> 01:14:01.547]  So maybe it won't implement until May of 2010 or two years from now.
[01:14:03.048 --> 01:14:04.348]  Two and a half years from now, roughly.
[01:14:05.729 --> 01:14:06.729]  That's all red herrings.
[01:14:07.535 --> 01:14:13.618]  This is just making a federal law that the states have to have this, and you have to have this to fly or cross state lines.
[01:14:13.918 --> 01:14:15.019]  It's an internal checkpoint.
[01:14:15.119 --> 01:14:15.879]  It actually says it.
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:21.502]  Or to go to any events, you're going to have to have it standardized.
[01:14:21.582 --> 01:14:25.123]  But most of the things the states do with the feds aren't laws.
[01:14:26.504 --> 01:14:28.945]  They are simply unfunded mandates.
[01:14:29.085 --> 01:14:30.966]  This is a funded mandate, at least partially.
[01:14:31.646 --> 01:14:34.808]  And so the states in 93 began the arduous task
[01:14:35.564 --> 01:14:40.387]  I'm converting over to a standardized federal, which has already been standardized, international system.
[01:14:40.427 --> 01:14:46.470]  So, every state already has the barcode embedded in the digital photo.
[01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:47.070]  They do both.
[01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:49.391]  They take a digital photo and that also creates a barcode.
[01:14:50.131 --> 01:14:51.392]  That's what the biometrics do.
[01:14:51.892 --> 01:14:54.414]  The black strip on the back can be swiped.
[01:14:54.534 --> 01:14:56.294]  Those were the first two things it had to have.
[01:14:56.615 --> 01:15:01.217]  The Feds said we would like a thumbprint or index print or palm print.
[01:15:02.885 --> 01:15:05.526]  Uh, but then a standard number is created off that.
[01:15:05.626 --> 01:15:31.196]  See, it doesn't matter if it's any of those three, because, and then later they said retina's good too, because they make a scan, the imprint off that, and then they calculate between the different measurements of the blood levels in the eye, or the, uh, fingerprints in the thumb or hand or fingers, and then they create a number and then it's assigned, and now your face, your hand, your retina, your thumb is the key to access the database.
[01:15:32.498 --> 01:15:34.699]  People say, well, I don't care if they thumb-scan me.
[01:15:34.719 --> 01:15:35.099]  I don't care.
[01:15:35.119 --> 01:15:36.099]  That's for my security.
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:38.080]  No, it's to track and trace and control you.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:46.683]  And then you wonder, how are they now announcing they've got face-scanning cameras coast-to-coast, scanning our faces, and IBM's running it, and put the same system in in Communist China this year?
[01:15:48.704 --> 01:15:50.225]  Told you six, seven years ago they'd already done it.
[01:15:50.265 --> 01:15:50.965]  Now they're announcing it.
[01:15:51.105 --> 01:15:53.126]  I was reading industry publications and legislation.
[01:15:54.206 --> 01:15:57.607]  It's the driver's license photo is put into the international database.
[01:15:58.067 --> 01:16:02.109]  So when you're on the streets of London, the streets of Moscow, the streets of Beijing,
[01:16:03.064 --> 01:16:03.664]  It doesn't matter.
[01:16:03.704 --> 01:16:05.485]  The streets of Mexico City, they put it in.
[01:16:06.065 --> 01:16:07.926]  Those cameras now know who you are.
[01:16:09.226 --> 01:16:09.546]  Okay?
[01:16:11.827 --> 01:16:29.353]  And we've talked a lot about this, but remember about six months ago, seven months ago, a bunch of air marshals, including the director of the sector based out in Colorado, just said they complained when public threatened to resign.
[01:16:29.413 --> 01:16:31.774]  Some did resign, if memory serves, and said,
[01:16:32.825 --> 01:16:34.165]  There are no real terrorists.
[01:16:34.646 --> 01:16:36.286]  That is, we never run into any real terrorist.
[01:16:36.786 --> 01:16:43.048]  And they want a quota of scores of names each month from each officer.
[01:16:43.969 --> 01:16:54.172]  And so we have to sit there on the plane or in the airports, writing the names of innocent people down, getting the names of innocent people, and putting them in a terror database for the rest of their lives.
[01:16:54.212 --> 01:17:00.514]  And they said, ordering something separate, being a vegetarian, asking for something else on the menu, you go on the list.
[01:17:01.952 --> 01:17:14.737]  If you take a photo in the plane, if you take a photo in the airport, if... They just have a whole score of things that they put in the database.
[01:17:14.777 --> 01:17:17.938]  Now, the Homeland Security database started with about 20,000.
[01:17:19.358 --> 01:17:22.960]  Last time I checked it was 900 and something thou a few months ago.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:25.481]  Now that's the public database.
[01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:29.342]  So it's approaching one million people in it.
[01:17:30.427 --> 01:17:32.269]  Bad credit is put in the database.
[01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:34.190]  Everything's put in there.
[01:17:34.891 --> 01:17:44.720]  And they use the matrix system, that's what it's called, that a bunch of Bush administration people make money off of and own, to implement this.
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:46.041]  Giuliani's deeply involved.
[01:17:47.062 --> 01:17:57.251]  And so not only are they setting up this tyranny, they get to make profits, huge profits, off of the infrastructure they're putting in place.
[01:17:58.621 --> 01:18:01.122]  I mean, Giuliani, this guy's kind of like the new Rumsfeld.
[01:18:01.602 --> 01:18:08.125]  I mean, going back 30 years, anything evil, you'd get to the end of it, you'd get to the bottom of it, and it'd be Rumsfeld looking back at you.
[01:18:08.205 --> 01:18:18.789]  GMO foods, Terminator genes, nuclear reactors, bioweapons, chemical weapons, aspartame, I mean, Prozac.
[01:18:19.449 --> 01:18:23.171]  I mean, this guy literally is everywhere.
[01:18:25.592 --> 01:18:31.875]  I mean, he's definitely one of the dark generals they dispatch out of Fels of Doom to do their work.
[01:18:32.715 --> 01:18:33.836]  Well, now it's Giuliani.
[01:18:34.736 --> 01:18:39.678]  Toll roads, taking over water districts, power plants, foreign companies seizing infrastructure.
[01:18:39.998 --> 01:18:40.638]  Giuliani.
[01:18:41.199 --> 01:18:42.899]  Big Brother tracking, face scanning.
[01:18:42.959 --> 01:18:43.560]  Giuliani.
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.621]  Son of a mob boss did time for armed robbery.
[01:18:48.222 --> 01:18:49.342]  You're not supposed to talk about that.
[01:18:49.362 --> 01:18:51.583]  We'll be back with more of your calls in 10 minutes.
[01:18:53.522 --> 01:18:54.804]  Ted Anders from Midas, December 18, 2007.
[01:18:54.904 --> 01:18:57.849]  Gold 890 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $825.08, $406.65 for half, $203.33 per quarter.
[01:18:57.889 --> 01:18:58.249]  That's $825.08, $406.65 and $203.33.
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:10.882]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[01:19:11.182 --> 01:19:15.385]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[01:19:15.765 --> 01:19:19.748]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[01:19:20.208 --> 01:19:22.049]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:24.231]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[01:19:24.511 --> 01:19:30.495]  The ideas of strong currency ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[01:19:30.936 --> 01:19:37.720]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:38.901]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[01:19:38.921 --> 01:19:39.221]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:42.103]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[01:19:42.263 --> 01:19:42.664]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:42.684 --> 01:19:44.225]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[01:19:53.551 --> 01:19:56.994]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:19:57.234 --> 01:19:59.336]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:19:59.496 --> 01:20:01.958]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:20:02.218 --> 01:20:06.561]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:07.282]  Here's why.
[01:20:07.702 --> 01:20:13.626]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:20:13.867 --> 01:20:19.871]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[01:20:20.111 --> 01:20:21.032]  But they're not cheating.
[01:20:21.252 --> 01:20:25.253]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:20:25.433 --> 01:20:29.774]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:20:29.874 --> 01:20:37.375]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:20:37.415 --> 01:20:38.035]  Get control.
[01:20:38.255 --> 01:20:38.816]  Get relief.
[01:20:38.896 --> 01:20:39.576]  Get some sleep.
[01:20:39.696 --> 01:20:42.876]  Go to www.OutIn90.com.
[01:20:43.016 --> 01:20:46.397]  That's www.OutIn90.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:20:46.417 --> 01:20:46.597]  That's 877-327-0365.

[01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:59.111]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[01:21:59.291 --> 01:22:04.453]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:22:04.733 --> 01:22:09.814]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:22:10.094 --> 01:22:13.655]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[01:22:13.955 --> 01:22:14.716]  We're good to go!
[01:22:40.939 --> 01:22:42.120]  We don't need no education.
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:43.901]  We don't need no thought control.
[01:23:15.074 --> 01:23:16.794]  William and Arkansas, you're on the air.
[01:23:16.854 --> 01:23:17.534]  Welcome, William.
[01:23:18.574 --> 01:23:20.135]  Hey Alex, how you doing, buddy?
[01:23:20.215 --> 01:23:20.475]  Good.
[01:23:21.235 --> 01:23:27.356]  Hey, no, I just wanted to, wasn't it Ronald Reagan that said nothing but good things about Ron Paul?
[01:23:28.196 --> 01:23:28.456]  Yes.
[01:23:29.116 --> 01:23:32.077]  You know, he needs to read his own daddy's, you know, work.
[01:23:32.677 --> 01:23:36.718]  Anyways, I got in-game, I appreciate that and everything.
[01:23:37.924 --> 01:23:48.633]  I was going to talk to you about, how do I inform these people that's got their heads in the sand about the FEMA trailers and the vaccines and stuff?
[01:23:48.653 --> 01:23:49.834]  What's the best way to get to them?
[01:23:49.854 --> 01:23:55.359]  The best way is to go, hey, have you heard about how corrupt empires and elites have killed and hurt a lot of people?
[01:23:55.859 --> 01:24:01.364]  Are you aware that liberty is very rare and that our government has gone bad and been bought off by foreign interest?
[01:24:02.131 --> 01:24:04.413]  Are you aware they're destroying the dollar by design?
[01:24:04.953 --> 01:24:06.474]  Are you aware that there's a new world order?
[01:24:06.615 --> 01:24:07.956]  Here's a documentary film.
[01:24:08.016 --> 01:24:10.818]  That's the most effective thing to do.
[01:24:10.878 --> 01:24:17.022]  And frankly, I think Endgame is the most effective film out there, or Freedom to Fascism, or Loose Change Final Cut, or something along those lines.
[01:24:17.063 --> 01:24:25.469]  But if they laugh at you, know that they may wake up a week from now, six months from now, two years from now, they will remember
[01:24:26.209 --> 01:24:32.871]  Very few will never wake up compared to those that those seeds that have been planted will sprout.
[01:24:33.371 --> 01:24:37.892]  But if they start laughing at you or being aggressive or seem threatened by it, just move on.
[01:24:38.832 --> 01:24:43.393]  A lot of people just try to convince one or two people they know and they just stay on it and have arguments all the time.
[01:24:43.833 --> 01:24:44.934]  Don't make it about an argument.
[01:24:45.554 --> 01:24:49.435]  Make it like a forest ranger walking up to some campers and going,
[01:24:50.801 --> 01:24:54.923]  A grizzly bear has been seen in the area and approached some people.
[01:24:54.943 --> 01:24:55.984]  They had to climb a tree.
[01:24:56.724 --> 01:24:58.205]  You might want to not camp here tonight.
[01:24:58.245 --> 01:24:59.386]  You might want to get out of the area.
[01:25:00.006 --> 01:25:00.306]  Okay.
[01:25:00.386 --> 01:25:03.288]  It's just, you'll walk up to them and say, hey, there's some serious stuff going on.
[01:25:03.308 --> 01:25:04.409]  You need to know about it.
[01:25:04.469 --> 01:25:05.609]  Here's where you can find out more.
[01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:09.271]  I'm warning you, it's up to you to find out more.
[01:25:09.591 --> 01:25:10.792]  Just be real matter of fact.
[01:25:11.412 --> 01:25:11.913]  Okie doke.
[01:25:12.313 --> 01:25:19.757]  Yeah, I gave them a copy of Northwoods, you know, the superintendent here at my kids' school, because they've got these FEMA trailers in there now.
[01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.901]  And I was like, you know, that ain't gonna work.
[01:25:24.001 --> 01:25:34.963]  And then I gave them the, you know, the cover-up that Congress went through about the FEMA trailers and everything, and they said, well, it came from the Internet, so it ain't a reliable source, you know?
[01:25:35.203 --> 01:25:39.104]  But they can go to ABC News, Baltimore Sun, and read about Operation Northwoods.
[01:25:39.124 --> 01:25:39.704]  Thanks for the call.
[01:25:40.204 --> 01:25:42.645]  Yeah, yeah, this is something else I see people do.
[01:25:42.705 --> 01:25:43.465]  It's this denial.
[01:25:44.846 --> 01:25:46.726]  They'll say, nothing on the Internet's real.
[01:25:48.348 --> 01:25:49.069]  But wait a minute.
[01:25:49.089 --> 01:25:50.610]  ESPN is on the internet.
[01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:52.311]  Associated Press is on the internet.
[01:25:53.031 --> 01:25:54.812]  Whitehouse.gov is on the internet.
[01:25:54.852 --> 01:25:56.113]  The Congress is on the internet.
[01:25:56.133 --> 01:25:57.634]  The Library of Congress is on the internet.
[01:25:57.874 --> 01:25:59.456]  The National Archive is on the internet.
[01:26:00.936 --> 01:26:06.300]  And I've had that happen to me with Operation Northwood, probably on 20, 30 programs over the years.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:06.840]  Probably more.
[01:26:08.361 --> 01:26:10.383]  So I've been talking about Northwood since before it happened.
[01:26:10.663 --> 01:26:12.064]  Since before 9-11 took place.
[01:26:12.839 --> 01:26:18.060]  And I'll go on the show and I'll say, here is Operation Northwood's official government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:20.141]  Oh, that's off the internet.
[01:26:20.181 --> 01:26:20.721]  That's fake.
[01:26:20.961 --> 01:26:22.161]  You can fake that document.
[01:26:22.561 --> 01:26:26.902]  And then I always go, oh, well here's Baltimore Sun and ABC News.
[01:26:26.942 --> 01:26:32.823]  And they'll read the headline and go, well, that was a long time ago.
[01:26:32.843 --> 01:26:35.044]  Besides, it's the internet.
[01:26:35.644 --> 01:26:37.044]  I'm like, no, no, it's ABC News.
[01:26:37.064 --> 01:26:38.004]  Well, they could fake that.
[01:26:38.565 --> 01:26:40.085]  No, it's abcnews.com.
[01:26:42.882 --> 01:26:44.742]  Every once in a while, there are fake news sites.
[01:26:44.822 --> 01:26:49.023]  People will put up, like, a hoax Fox News story, but it'll be a different web address.
[01:26:50.184 --> 01:26:51.764]  See, it's a web address you look at.
[01:26:52.504 --> 01:26:54.104]  But see, the establishment knows.
[01:26:54.184 --> 01:26:55.165]  They know it's real.
[01:26:55.525 --> 01:26:58.525]  They just, for the general public, they just put out there, oh, that's that internet.
[01:26:58.965 --> 01:27:10.728]  But now, with close to 80% of the population routinely on the web, and web savviness raising to a higher level daily, that tactic is not working anymore.
[01:27:11.974 --> 01:27:13.435]  I'm just saying, oh, that's the Internet.
[01:27:15.016 --> 01:27:20.360]  I mean, I saw different emails and posts and comments about the video in St.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:26.305]  Petersburg with a Republican Florida straw poll, and they allow Ron Paul.
[01:27:27.665 --> 01:27:31.388]  Supporters can only vote once, and to be fair, it was other Republicans can only vote once.
[01:27:31.408 --> 01:27:32.969]  Giuliani can only vote once, his people.
[01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:37.533]  But the people running it were Mitt Romney supporters, and they're dirty folks.
[01:27:37.553 --> 01:27:39.254]  They'll do whatever they have to.
[01:27:40.283 --> 01:27:42.124]  And, uh, I keep seeing that with Romney.
[01:27:42.144 --> 01:27:43.025]  They're really bad.
[01:27:43.785 --> 01:27:48.729]  And, uh, you can act all Christian and good on the surface, but, I mean, it's just wicked fruit.
[01:27:49.489 --> 01:27:51.431]  And right in front of news cameras, they just did it.
[01:27:51.871 --> 01:27:53.172]  People say, well, that's on the Internet.
[01:27:53.192 --> 01:27:57.094]  That, you know, that YouTube video that was posted, that's the Internet.
[01:27:57.555 --> 01:27:59.056]  Well, the paper reported it happened.
[01:27:59.396 --> 01:28:00.637]  No, it just didn't reel.
[01:28:02.138 --> 01:28:03.759]  See, it's that self-denial.
[01:28:04.079 --> 01:28:05.160]  It's that willful ignorance.
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:07.061]  They engineer that into us.
[01:28:07.862 --> 01:28:13.429]  And Joseph Goebbels wrote about how good propaganda is multi-layered, but the base layer is just speaking to your own laziness.
[01:28:14.250 --> 01:28:17.475]  Speaking to your own, oh, I want to procrastinate, oh, it's not that bad.
[01:28:18.576 --> 01:28:22.501]  Oh, you know, the... And then, you just give in to it.
[01:28:22.521 --> 01:28:23.422]  Alright.
[01:28:23.843 --> 01:28:26.106]  I'm steadily going through your calls, but not fast enough.
[01:28:26.989 --> 01:28:30.372]  We come back, I'm giving each caller one minute.
[01:28:30.392 --> 01:28:31.513]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:31.894 --> 01:28:33.595]  But it's interesting, I love the grab bag.
[01:28:33.655 --> 01:28:39.761]  Each new caller with a new point, new topic, new angle, and we don't screen your calls, ladies and gentlemen, unlike almost everybody else.
[01:28:43.745 --> 01:28:44.786]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.126 --> 01:28:46.767]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.668 --> 01:28:50.371]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.735 --> 01:28:54.616]  Storable Food!
[01:28:54.836 --> 01:28:55.636]  Storable Food!
[01:29:23.575 --> 01:29:23.955]  I think so.
[01:29:53.783 --> 01:29:56.985]  Yes, there is an In-Dash AM-FM shortwave radio.

[01:30:41.618 --> 01:30:41.839]  Call 877-817-9829.

[01:30:53.701 --> 01:30:57.044]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[01:30:57.384 --> 01:31:04.291]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:31:04.651 --> 01:31:17.162]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000 year old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[01:31:17.383 --> 01:31:20.045]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[01:31:20.365 --> 01:31:26.550]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:31.934]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now, a small amount is available to my listeners.
[01:31:32.194 --> 01:31:40.441]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.
[01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:41.301]  And the best part?
[01:31:41.521 --> 01:31:43.523]  My listeners pay absolutely nothing today.
[01:31:43.783 --> 01:31:46.024]  Simply go to 321release.com or call 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:32:35.275 --> 01:32:40.118]  We're going to go to Troy and Jay and Mike and Eric and Dan and many others.
[01:32:40.138 --> 01:32:44.181]  Then I'm going to play, before this hour ends, this ABC News clip.
[01:32:45.522 --> 01:32:54.687]  Really whitewashing, and you'd hear this and think that these psychotropic drugs are bad for kids and that they're really exposing them, but this doesn't get into one-tenth of really how bad it is.
[01:32:54.727 --> 01:33:02.312]  So I want to analyze this piece to see how, even when we think someone's exposing something, they really aren't.
[01:33:03.627 --> 01:33:10.749]  I've got a bunch of Rob Paul clips, some economic news I haven't properly covered yet about the stagflation, the Greenspan is talking about.
[01:33:11.309 --> 01:33:16.151]  Here at the halfway point of this transmission, we are still shipping out all the orders that come in.
[01:33:16.851 --> 01:33:23.073]  All the orders that came in from Sunday and all the orders that came in Monday, up until UPS came in at 6 o'clock, were shipped out.
[01:33:24.134 --> 01:33:26.034]  And pretty much anywhere in the U.S.
[01:33:26.054 --> 01:33:28.295]  via UPS, you should get them before Christmas.
[01:33:29.509 --> 01:33:36.037]  Today, tomorrow, unless you live in the four or five states around Texas, you probably won't get it until after Christmas.
[01:33:36.698 --> 01:33:40.162]  But regardless, if you haven't done Christmas shopping yet, let them get it late!
[01:33:41.136 --> 01:33:44.917]  You can go in there, order the books, the videos, the tapes, the t-shirts, whatever you want.
[01:33:44.937 --> 01:33:55.519]  It's all about getting the info out, and tell us which address you want us to send it to, and if we ship it out today or tomorrow, some will get it before Christmas, others will get it after Christmas, and you can say, here's your Christmas present.
[01:33:56.019 --> 01:34:03.240]  It's a great, even if you're not a Christian and don't celebrate Christmas, it's a great way, a great excuse to wake people up today.
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:07.121]  There is something you can give before Christmas, though.
[01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:11.251]  PrisonPlanet.tv, give somebody a yearly membership.
[01:34:11.812 --> 01:34:13.372]  Now a monthly membership is normally $5.95.
[01:34:14.633 --> 01:34:18.074]  Trial membership $5.95, the cost of two cups of Starbucks coffee.
[01:34:18.794 --> 01:34:25.337]  But for the month of December, we've done this for the last four Christmases, almost four years now this thing's been in operation.
[01:34:26.658 --> 01:34:27.938]  Come up in April, it'll be four years.
[01:34:28.438 --> 01:34:30.119]  But we've been doing this ever since we started.
[01:34:31.307 --> 01:34:32.968]  And so I guess three Christmases so far.
[01:34:33.629 --> 01:34:41.133]  And in the month of December, you get five plus months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:42.354 --> 01:34:47.657]  And even if you are not very tech savvy like I am, it's so easy to sign up.
[01:34:47.677 --> 01:34:53.561]  You just go in there, pay by PayPal or credit card, $5.95, or get a yearly membership and get five months free.
[01:34:53.581 --> 01:34:56.182]  It comes out to 5.3 months free.
[01:34:57.703 --> 01:35:00.605]  So you pay for six months and some change and get five months free for the year.
[01:35:02.458 --> 01:35:14.006]  All my films, all my weekly TV reports, special video reports, in-game 1.5, almost two hours of extra footage and interviews and behind-the-scenes stuff from in-game that isn't on the DVD or on the extras.
[01:35:14.326 --> 01:35:16.207]  That was for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:35:16.867 --> 01:35:17.728]  So much there!
[01:35:18.108 --> 01:35:23.332]  Thousands of pieces of audio, video, other films even authorized to post.
[01:35:23.832 --> 01:35:26.674]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:27.814 --> 01:35:31.697]  And when you go to PrisonPlanet.tv, again, it takes about a minute to sign up.
[01:35:32.489 --> 01:35:35.691]  You just click the PayPal account or the credit card.
[01:35:36.691 --> 01:35:37.192]  Enter that.
[01:35:37.272 --> 01:35:38.773]  Create a username and password.
[01:35:39.933 --> 01:35:41.975]  And you can even create a username and password.
[01:35:42.035 --> 01:35:44.816]  Give them a monthly subscription or buy them a yearly subscription.
[01:35:45.257 --> 01:35:46.057]  Use it for yourself.
[01:35:46.157 --> 01:35:46.697]  I don't care.
[01:35:47.238 --> 01:35:48.338]  Share it with somebody.
[01:35:49.659 --> 01:35:51.460]  And put it in a card.
[01:35:52.621 --> 01:35:54.262]  Give it to them on Christmas morning.
[01:35:54.442 --> 01:35:56.603]  Or email it to them and say, hey, here's your Christmas present.
[01:35:57.023 --> 01:35:57.784]  A membership here.
[01:35:58.377 --> 01:36:10.067]  Because End Game, Terror Storm, the quality in the Flash Video and the Quick Time and the other systems, it's almost DVD quality now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:10.627 --> 01:36:18.213]  And it is an armory, it is a place to go and arm yourself for the Info War with these Info Weapons, these Info Bombs.
[01:36:19.214 --> 01:36:23.017]  And so if you have a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, don't wait anymore.
[01:36:24.888 --> 01:36:29.071]  Use the membership to burn them to DVD, to disc, to CD.
[01:36:30.292 --> 01:36:35.756]  Give them to friends and family and just say, hey, this is a pretty wild film, Endgame, or pretty wild film, Terrorstorm.
[01:36:36.217 --> 01:36:37.758]  Tell me what you think of it.
[01:36:38.859 --> 01:36:45.003]  Or, of course, if you want, you can get the high quality, super high res DVD directly from us, which is even better quality.
[01:36:45.804 --> 01:36:49.026]  And those are also available at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:36:53.752 --> 01:36:58.835]  Okay, that said, let's go to Troy in Oregon.
[01:36:58.875 --> 01:36:59.695]  Troy, you're on the air.
[01:37:00.496 --> 01:37:01.537]  Hey Alex, good to talk to you.
[01:37:01.557 --> 01:37:02.717]  I appreciate everything you do.
[01:37:02.937 --> 01:37:03.438]  Thank you, sir.
[01:37:03.458 --> 01:37:04.018]  What's on your mind?
[01:37:04.662 --> 01:37:15.771]  Well, I've been listening to you talk about Romans 13 for a while now, and I never hear you kind of rebut and how to fix the way that people just lay down and roll over for that chapter.
[01:37:16.652 --> 01:37:23.297]  In Ephesians, Paul, who also wrote Romans, Paul talks about the armor of God in Ephesians chapter 6 and 10.
[01:37:23.578 --> 01:37:25.960]  It says, Finally, be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power.
[01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:29.723]  Put on the full armor of God, so you can take your stand against the devil's scheme.
[01:37:30.043 --> 01:37:32.285]  For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[01:37:32.765 --> 01:37:38.169]  But against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world.
[01:37:38.749 --> 01:37:41.631]  So we're not supposed to be following these evildoers.
[01:37:41.711 --> 01:37:43.352]  We're supposed to stand up for what's right.
[01:37:43.412 --> 01:37:45.813]  And I think that Paul is talking about that right there.
[01:37:45.833 --> 01:37:51.897]  I just wanted to give the Christians maybe a little bit of ammo to use to talk about that situation when it comes up.
[01:37:53.138 --> 01:37:54.279]  I've got an idea for you.
[01:37:54.319 --> 01:37:56.140]  Your phone's bad, but your info's great.
[01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:59.422]  Why don't you write a little 5-6 paragraph article with
[01:38:00.046 --> 01:38:15.801]  How Hitler used Romans 13 to control his population, and then give some of those passages that I'm well aware of, showing how it's a complete fraud, email it to Aaron at Infowars.com or to Paul Watson, and we'll post it and hundreds of thousands will see it, sir.
[01:38:16.702 --> 01:38:17.022]  All right.
[01:38:17.042 --> 01:38:17.623]  Thank you very much.
[01:38:17.763 --> 01:38:18.083]  You bet.
[01:38:18.363 --> 01:38:20.385]  Listen, the ball is in your court.
[01:38:20.405 --> 01:38:21.206]  That was a great caller.
[01:38:21.226 --> 01:38:22.067]  I had to cut him off, though.
[01:38:22.651 --> 01:38:24.271]  Man, I think phones are getting worse and worse.
[01:38:24.291 --> 01:38:25.792]  These IP phones and cell phones.
[01:38:25.812 --> 01:38:30.013]  Like, half the calls are like... And I just can't handle it.
[01:38:30.433 --> 01:38:31.593]  Even though your info is great.
[01:38:34.414 --> 01:38:34.874]  Everybody.
[01:38:35.754 --> 01:38:37.415]  We've got so many intelligent listeners.
[01:38:37.455 --> 01:38:38.235]  I talk to you on air.
[01:38:38.255 --> 01:38:39.095]  I talk to you off air.
[01:38:39.135 --> 01:38:42.996]  I see the incredible comments our listeners put on the dig points.
[01:38:43.036 --> 01:38:44.716]  They make points that I wouldn't even have thought of.
[01:38:45.177 --> 01:38:45.937]  So eloquent.
[01:38:47.037 --> 01:38:50.518]  We need you to write stories for PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:38:51.559 --> 01:38:53.039]  I mean, write them, have them sourced.
[01:38:54.319 --> 01:38:56.020]  Most of the stuff you send us, we end up posting.
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:59.420]  I mean, if it's quacky stuff and we can't document it, we won't post it.
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:02.101]  We'll vet your story real fast, but we need your help.
[01:39:03.021 --> 01:39:04.201]  You know, email Curt Nemo.
[01:39:04.641 --> 01:39:06.121]  Go to Truth in News and contact him.
[01:39:06.161 --> 01:39:06.902]  Send him stories.
[01:39:07.362 --> 01:39:08.762]  You know, readers submitted articles.
[01:39:09.262 --> 01:39:11.982]  You can call them letters to the editor, but you can put your own headline on it.
[01:39:13.203 --> 01:39:13.963]  We will post it.
[01:39:15.843 --> 01:39:17.543]  I mean, you've got the brains out there.
[01:39:18.124 --> 01:39:19.224]  We've got the platform.
[01:39:19.664 --> 01:39:20.844]  Let's wake a lot of people up.
[01:39:22.216 --> 01:39:23.357]  Alright, let's move quick here.
[01:39:23.917 --> 01:39:40.245]  And yes, all the prophets were killed, or almost all of them had their heads chopped off, crucified, crucified upside down, boiled in oil, imprisoned, beaten to death, stoned, on and on and on and on and on for speaking up against the corrupt government.
[01:39:40.865 --> 01:39:45.088]  But man, FEMA's gone in and hired 26,000, it was 13,000.
[01:39:45.128 --> 01:39:47.169]  Remember, we broke this over a year before it was in the news.
[01:39:47.229 --> 01:39:47.869]  Now it's in the news.
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:53.561]  And they go out and they say, turn your guns in, hand your kids over, take inoculations, go to FEMA centers.
[01:39:54.381 --> 01:40:01.263]  See, it goes from that crazy nut Alex Jones, ten years ago, telling you about this stuff, to now mainstream news.
[01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:04.384]  By the way, we've got new listeners that don't believe me.
[01:40:04.404 --> 01:40:10.325]  We found the Marshall Law clip when they finally did a TV show piece on it, The Preachers.
[01:40:11.245 --> 01:40:15.426]  And of course, Paul said, we've got to fight against the evil rulers.
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:19.121]  But the churches are on the payroll of the government.
[01:40:20.642 --> 01:40:22.483]  And many of them are.
[01:40:22.543 --> 01:40:25.124]  Many others are told what to say by their denominations.
[01:40:26.244 --> 01:40:26.585]  Here it is.
[01:40:26.605 --> 01:40:27.285]  We'll go to more calls.
[01:40:28.405 --> 01:40:30.867]  Will it ever become a reality in America?
[01:40:31.267 --> 01:40:35.589]  Some fear any nuclear, biological, or chemical attack on U.S.
[01:40:35.649 --> 01:40:37.730]  territory might trigger just that.
[01:40:38.190 --> 01:40:45.073]  NSK Hawaii News 12's Jeff Beryl discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:48.562]  From my cold, dead hand!
[01:40:48.722 --> 01:40:52.885]  Charlton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American value.
[01:40:53.305 --> 01:40:55.947]  The overarching desire to protect our freedoms.
[01:40:56.627 --> 01:41:02.892]  But gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
[01:41:03.592 --> 01:41:03.852]  U.S.
[01:41:03.912 --> 01:41:05.073]  troops also arrived.
[01:41:05.414 --> 01:41:12.178]  Something far easier to do even now thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act.
[01:41:12.659 --> 01:41:13.739]  That forbid U.S.
[01:41:13.799 --> 01:41:15.841]  troops from policing on American soil.
[01:41:18.055 --> 01:41:25.198]  If martial law were enacted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege, easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[01:41:25.698 --> 01:41:31.321]  And that's exactly what the Clergy Response Team, as it's called, helped accomplish in New Orleans.
[01:41:31.341 --> 01:41:37.904]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody is, let's go out there and get this thing over with, and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[01:41:38.184 --> 01:41:42.266]  Such Clergy Response Teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government,
[01:41:42.906 --> 01:41:50.129]  In a lot of cases, these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're helping to defuse that situation.
[01:41:50.169 --> 01:41:52.030]  Because the government's established all the law.
[01:42:05.151 --> 01:42:05.431]  You know?
[01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:07.393]  And that's what we believe in the Christian faith.
[01:42:07.413 --> 01:42:08.654]  That's what's stated in the scripture.
[01:42:09.254 --> 01:42:18.081]  Civil rights advocates believe the amount of public cooperation may depend largely on how long they expect the suspension of their rights might last.
[01:42:19.101 --> 01:42:20.763]  Jeff Ferrell, KSLA News 12 reporting.
[01:42:21.583 --> 01:42:28.949]  According to 2Brazil, during Hurricane Katrina, the clergy response team provided 38 chaplains a day, around the clock, at eight different camps.
[01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:30.631]  Eight different camps.
[01:42:30.671 --> 01:42:32.272]  Now notice that was in place before.
[01:42:32.572 --> 01:42:35.995]  And covertly, about almost two years ago, we got contacted by two different pastors.
[01:42:36.515 --> 01:42:42.500]  They sent us restricted documents, gun confiscation, forced inoculations, having your families broken up.
[01:42:43.921 --> 01:42:45.703]  And notice it was already in place in New Orleans.
[01:42:45.783 --> 01:42:56.311]  Now you hear about Rick Perry going, yeah, we're going to confiscate your guns, we're going to put you on buses, we're going to split your families up, we're going to retina scan you, we're going to put you in databases, we're going to check your crime record.
[01:42:56.980 --> 01:43:01.023]  Well, that's what I videotaped Marines doing in 1999 in Urban Warrior in Oakland.
[01:43:01.063 --> 01:43:05.186]  And they were training to put Americans in camps and break our families up and take our guns.
[01:43:05.326 --> 01:43:06.367]  It's them on video.
[01:43:06.948 --> 01:43:09.930]  Now, Americans back then saw the video and thought it was fake.
[01:43:10.791 --> 01:43:15.194]  They thought I hired the Coronado aircraft carrier, troop carrier ship.
[01:43:15.214 --> 01:43:16.655]  It's a medium-sized aircraft carrier.
[01:43:17.296 --> 01:43:20.218]  They thought I hired Cobra, Sea Cobras, Chinooks,
[01:43:20.945 --> 01:43:27.689]  They thought I hired over 20 warrior fighting vehicles, Marines by the thousands.
[01:43:28.170 --> 01:43:29.030]  Hovercraft landing.
[01:43:31.572 --> 01:43:36.735]  They didn't ever go to the Marine Corps website and see the photos of the video I'd gotten, and the Marines were taking photos themselves.
[01:43:37.596 --> 01:43:38.516]  They didn't check into it.
[01:43:39.077 --> 01:43:41.138]  They didn't go check out the local newscast about it.
[01:43:41.718 --> 01:43:43.920]  They just said, hey, it's a lie, doesn't exist.
[01:43:45.661 --> 01:43:47.002]  Pretty easy for you to do, huh?
[01:43:48.715 --> 01:43:52.439]  Now you notice there they said the needs of the government versus the needs of the people.
[01:43:52.479 --> 01:43:54.380]  I thought our needs are the government's needs.
[01:43:54.961 --> 01:43:57.864]  You notice they said to have the people obey the law during martial law.
[01:43:58.344 --> 01:43:59.945]  Martial law is when there is no law.
[01:43:59.966 --> 01:44:01.807]  The government does whatever it wants.
[01:44:03.249 --> 01:44:04.470]  And our rights are suspended.
[01:44:07.252 --> 01:44:11.396]  So see now we're having it all introduced to us on TV and radio how it's good.
[01:44:12.137 --> 01:44:14.539]  How it's a good thing and how it keeps us safe.
[01:44:15.808 --> 01:44:22.231]  Let me explain something to the police, military, yuppies, people who think they're part of the establishment and the system out there that are listening.
[01:44:26.113 --> 01:44:27.154]  Let me explain something to you.
[01:44:28.495 --> 01:44:30.676]  This whole apparatus is built for you.
[01:44:32.597 --> 01:44:33.958]  Excuse me, I'm sick.
[01:44:34.578 --> 01:44:34.958]  Hold on.
[01:44:37.619 --> 01:44:38.420]  This whole thing
[01:44:39.395 --> 01:44:47.659]  It's about taking your house, taking your pension funds, taking your bank accounts, cracking down, bringing us into third world serfdom.
[01:44:48.319 --> 01:44:50.240]  It's in the IMF World Bank documents.
[01:44:51.181 --> 01:44:57.084]  They want to police state so they can totally destroy our economy and consolidate everything.
[01:44:57.664 --> 01:45:00.906]  For these globalists, it's not about free market, it's about rulership.
[01:45:01.646 --> 01:45:02.726]  It's about ruling.
[01:45:04.687 --> 01:45:05.668]  It's about hegemon.
[01:45:07.688 --> 01:45:08.929]  Hegemonic control.
[01:45:09.029 --> 01:45:11.409]  It's about monopoly of power.
[01:45:12.710 --> 01:45:33.258]  And the minute their sociologists and psychologists and war gamers, and the minute their computers tell them that they can move with staged terror attacks or bio-releases as the background culmination of the implosion of the society into total control, they will do it.
[01:45:33.778 --> 01:45:36.239]  Not the day, not the month, no.
[01:45:36.479 --> 01:45:37.079]  The minute
[01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:39.230]  They're not ready yet.
[01:45:39.370 --> 01:45:50.414]  That's why they're trying to do it by increments, and telling you torture is good, and secret arrest is good, and foreigners and open borders are good for your security, and black ski masks are good, and tasering you if you don't sign a ticket is good.
[01:45:50.854 --> 01:45:53.115]  You poor police officers, you're going to lose everything.
[01:45:53.435 --> 01:45:59.237]  And I just want you to understand, when all that happens, that it was the New World Order that did it to you.
[01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:09.233]  And I want all the yuppies and all the people that are into themselves and all the establishment types and all the good ol' boys that think they've got it all made.
[01:46:09.453 --> 01:46:11.614]  All the people on little personal power trips.
[01:46:13.575 --> 01:46:16.057]  I want you to know that I saw all this coming, okay?
[01:46:16.817 --> 01:46:18.318]  I went to the urban warfare drills.
[01:46:18.438 --> 01:46:19.979]  I watched them take over real towns.
[01:46:20.339 --> 01:46:22.560]  I watched Marines pull real people out of cars.
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:25.221]  I watched them build FEMA camps.
[01:46:25.802 --> 01:46:28.623]  They didn't do all this because it was their hobby.
[01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:33.812]  I watched the congressional hearings where they admitted all this back in the 80's was being set up.
[01:46:34.673 --> 01:46:36.694]  This is a long-term strategic plan.
[01:46:37.815 --> 01:46:41.677]  And your preachers are out there giving speeches telling you to submit to government every day.
[01:46:41.877 --> 01:46:43.118]  And they're on the payroll of the government.
[01:46:43.378 --> 01:46:47.120]  I mean, how Soviet Union, how Nazi Germany is that?
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:54.464]  Every sign of tyranny, every classical thing they did in Russia and Nazi Germany is going on right now.
[01:46:56.590 --> 01:47:00.591]  From the black uniforms, to the names of the units, to all of it!
[01:47:01.832 --> 01:47:02.252]  All of it!
[01:47:05.493 --> 01:47:09.094]  All right, let's go to Jay in Tennessee.
[01:47:09.154 --> 01:47:09.754]  Jay, go ahead.
[01:47:10.975 --> 01:47:25.360]  Yes, on the topic of biorelease, natural or probably unnatural, I think it's interesting that if you... You know, you've had on your show, Dean Hagelin, before, talking about the long gunman episode, where there were, you know, mock
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:28.321]  Yeah, the CIA came.
[01:47:29.081 --> 01:47:33.783]  The CIA would come to them, and Dean Hackman showed up at my door starring in X-Files and The Lone Gunman to tell me this.
[01:47:34.404 --> 01:47:38.565]  They would show up at parties, and the CIA would say, you ought to put this in a script.
[01:47:39.486 --> 01:47:46.609]  And bottom line, they were approached, they implanted, well for those that don't know, Phil in the background.
[01:47:48.050 --> 01:47:54.513]  Well basically, it's just, I think it's on the second season, there was only two seasons of The Lone Gunman, but the spinoff of The X-Files and
[01:47:55.285 --> 01:48:05.749]  There was an episode where there were hijacked jets flown into World Trade Towers, and this is, I don't know, what, five, six months or something like that, three, four months before the actual events of 9-11.
[01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:20.535]  And what I'm wondering, I want your thoughts on this, and again, I'm not professing kind of, you know, miraculous, sagacious foresight, but we know that, you know, other instances could be given of, you know, Governor Keating's book before the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:48:21.195 --> 01:48:24.937]  We're seeing quite a... Yeah, we're a Tom McVeigh bombs the Federal Building.
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:42.630]  We're seeing presently, I guess, in our pop culture sort of group mind, we're seeing a continual incarnation, if you will, of the bio-release epidemic situation.
[01:48:42.650 --> 01:48:44.932]  Let me guess, you went and saw I Am Legend?
[01:48:45.832 --> 01:48:46.933]  Well, I'm thinking about that.
[01:48:46.953 --> 01:48:50.515]  I'm thinking it's the same scenario, the same theme.
[01:48:50.755 --> 01:48:52.016]  Let me just elaborate on that.
[01:48:53.405 --> 01:49:04.908]  Fox Television just didn't have a episode where a hijacked jet, where they try to fly it into the World Trade Center five months before 9-11.
[01:49:05.008 --> 01:49:08.109]  Let me tell you exactly what it did for listeners that don't know.
[01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:17.852]  A criminal group within the government is running hijacking drills and uses that to make the rest of the government stand down.
[01:49:19.329 --> 01:49:31.112]  And they use that as the cover and they claim that hijackers are on board the plane from a, quote, Middle Eastern, uh, you know, tin horn dictatorship and that they're going to fly it into the World Trade Center.
[01:49:32.152 --> 01:49:35.073]  And that then the Middle East would be invaded.
[01:49:36.393 --> 01:49:43.455]  Now, the government was running those exact drills on the day and did it exactly as the movie, as the TV show shows.
[01:49:44.375 --> 01:49:47.136]  And if you want to talk about this esoteric stuff, yes, they do that.
[01:49:47.496 --> 01:49:48.716]  It's part of their religion.
[01:49:49.396 --> 01:49:50.636]  Let me tell you about it on the other side.
[01:49:53.737 --> 01:49:55.137]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:55.157 --> 01:49:57.258]  A new world order.
[01:49:57.958 --> 01:50:02.219]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[01:50:02.879 --> 01:50:05.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:07.940]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:10.861]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:11.643 --> 01:50:19.003]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:21.992 --> 01:50:26.975]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:27.456 --> 01:50:30.918]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:31.298 --> 01:50:33.820]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:35.021]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.061 --> 01:50:35.801]  They're not after money.
[01:50:35.821 --> 01:50:36.882]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:37.102 --> 01:50:37.843]  They're after power.
[01:50:38.103 --> 01:50:38.943]  That's what they're after, you see.

[01:51:53.206 --> 01:52:02.848]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism, comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[01:52:02.988 --> 01:52:06.289]  Her face was the every face I've ever known.
[01:52:06.689 --> 01:52:08.389]  Her face was my own face.
[01:52:08.669 --> 01:52:13.210]  GCN brings you Uncivil Liberties, a movie the government does not want you to see.
[01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:15.830]  A political thriller ripped from today's headlines.
[01:52:15.930 --> 01:52:18.871]  Domestic spying, wiretapping, government chipping and more.
[01:52:19.091 --> 01:52:22.132]  The enemy of my enemy is my ally.
[01:52:22.232 --> 01:52:30.174]  For your copy of this hard-hitting film that will open your eyes, go to uncivilliberties.com to receive your full-length feature on DVD for only $13.95.

[01:52:36.196 --> 01:52:39.177]  That's uncivilliberties.com to view the movie trailer.
[01:52:41.906 --> 01:52:44.907]  We know it's a war game scenario that has to do with airline counter-terrorism.
[01:52:44.947 --> 01:52:46.908]  Why is it important enough to kill for?
[01:52:46.968 --> 01:52:48.028]  Because it's no longer a game.
[01:52:48.048 --> 01:52:49.149]  If some terrorist group wants to
[01:53:08.288 --> 01:53:11.930]  To act out this scenario, why target you for assassination?
[01:53:12.250 --> 01:53:13.911]  Depends on who your terrorists are.
[01:53:13.931 --> 01:53:17.693]  The men who conceived of it in the first place.
[01:53:20.155 --> 01:53:23.737]  You're saying our government plans to commit a terrorist act against a domestic airline?
[01:53:23.757 --> 01:53:24.197]  There you go!
[01:53:24.737 --> 01:53:26.338]  Dating the entire government, as usual.
[01:53:26.979 --> 01:53:27.479]  A faction.
[01:53:27.839 --> 01:53:29.060]  A small faction.
[01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:30.060]  What possible gain?
[01:53:31.081 --> 01:53:32.542]  The Cold War is over, John.
[01:53:33.274 --> 01:53:36.356]  But with no clear enemy to stockpile against, the arms market's flat.
[01:53:36.977 --> 01:53:49.005]  But bring down a fully loaded 727 into the middle of New York City, and you'll find a dozen tin-pot dictators all over the world, just clamoring to take responsibility, and begging to be smart-bombed.
[01:53:49.526 --> 01:53:50.046]  I can't believe it.
[01:53:50.206 --> 01:53:51.947]  This is about increasing our sales.
[01:53:54.749 --> 01:53:54.969]  When?
[01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:56.270]  Tonight.
[01:53:57.831 --> 01:53:58.692]  How are you going to stop them?
[01:54:00.202 --> 01:54:03.443]  That's what it looks like.
[01:54:03.904 --> 01:54:04.664]  Remote access.
[01:54:04.684 --> 01:54:06.205]  Somebody on the ground's flying your plane.
[01:54:07.025 --> 01:54:07.545]  Loading, sir.
[01:54:07.885 --> 01:54:08.666]  Keep your course.
[01:54:11.507 --> 01:54:14.088]  I need to know her flight plan.
[01:54:16.729 --> 01:54:17.950]  I'm mapping the data now.
[01:54:34.883 --> 01:54:38.445]  Your flight's going to make it up again.
[01:54:38.565 --> 01:54:39.245]  Don't stop.
[01:54:39.345 --> 01:54:40.746]  It's exactly 20 minutes.
[01:54:40.766 --> 01:54:43.427]  The border of Liberty and Washington.
[01:54:43.587 --> 01:54:44.987]  North Manhattan.
[01:54:45.027 --> 01:54:46.708]  World Trade Center.
[01:54:46.728 --> 01:54:49.769]  Couldn't crash the plane into the World Trade Center.
[01:54:49.869 --> 01:54:51.730]  I'll tell the flight crew.
[01:55:00.174 --> 01:55:01.735]  Alright, try cutting electrical power.
[01:55:01.775 --> 01:55:03.036]  Good thought of that.
[01:55:03.716 --> 01:55:06.258]  Good thought of everything.
[01:55:06.798 --> 01:55:09.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Cassidy.
[01:55:10.561 --> 01:55:14.243]  We're experiencing some, uh... But to make it even more believable, they actually had U.S.
[01:55:14.263 --> 01:55:19.226]  government agents, the hijackers, admittedly trained at our bases, admittedly with high-level security clearances.
[01:55:19.687 --> 01:55:22.308]  Heads of embassies, heads of spy bases, all went public.
[01:55:23.769 --> 01:55:25.751]  See, you say you couldn't keep something like this secret.
[01:55:25.771 --> 01:55:26.131]  They didn't.
[01:55:28.292 --> 01:55:29.473]  And there had to be more than 50.
[01:55:29.633 --> 01:55:35.635]  I was thinking about it during playing the clip of TV ads, radio ads, newsprint ads.
[01:55:37.516 --> 01:55:41.218]  On the Simpsons, we posted this up on my MySpace account earlier this week.
[01:55:42.438 --> 01:55:48.621]  One month before a new Simpsons episode, Mark Simpson holds out a stack of money in his hand and makes an 11.
[01:55:50.282 --> 01:55:58.726]  Pointed at a silhouette of New York with the two towers making an 11, and a 9 just pops up in the air right beside it, and he goes, ha ha ha!
[01:55:59.646 --> 01:56:02.908]  Made no sense, didn't even say what it meant, it was like, bing bing!
[01:56:02.928 --> 01:56:04.208]  9-11 with the towers!
[01:56:04.609 --> 01:56:06.790]  And Bart Simpson goes, ha ha ha!
[01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:10.451]  It's so much fun!
[01:56:11.532 --> 01:56:18.235]  And they believe because of what they're into, you could call it Kabbalah, whatever, it's all the same junk that, you know,
[01:56:19.329 --> 01:56:22.230]  All these groups are into, they believe, it's called lesser magic.
[01:56:22.670 --> 01:56:28.652]  They believe if you show what you're going to do before in a riddle, it's like the legends of vampires.
[01:56:28.692 --> 01:56:30.252]  They've got to trick their way into your house.
[01:56:30.293 --> 01:56:34.294]  They have to knock on your door and trick you into saying, welcome, come in.
[01:56:34.674 --> 01:56:36.034]  And then later they think they can come back.
[01:56:36.735 --> 01:56:37.555]  Look, they're crazy.
[01:56:38.235 --> 01:56:39.175]  They run everything though.
[01:56:39.235 --> 01:56:41.756]  And I'm not saying why they do this.
[01:56:41.856 --> 01:56:44.177]  I'm not saying that it makes sense.
[01:56:45.536 --> 01:56:49.280]  Uh, but they, Tom Clancy did a novel about how it was going to happen.
[01:56:50.381 --> 01:56:52.783]  Uh, and he was fed the info, he admits he was fed the info.
[01:56:53.544 --> 01:56:55.946]  Now you can say people inside intelligence were trying to warn us.
[01:56:55.986 --> 01:56:58.849]  Why did Northwoods get leaked nine months before 9-11?
[01:56:59.790 --> 01:57:01.211]  The plan to carry out the attacks.
[01:57:01.952 --> 01:57:03.954]  You could say it's good people trying to warn us.
[01:57:05.135 --> 01:57:09.379]  Uh, but Fox, two Fox programs,
[01:57:10.106 --> 01:57:10.506]  Stay there.
[01:57:10.526 --> 01:57:11.987]  I said I'd get to those other clips.
[01:57:12.027 --> 01:57:12.527]  I haven't yet.
[01:57:12.547 --> 01:57:16.408]  We're going to finish up with the first round of callers that we've got lined up here.
[01:57:17.108 --> 01:57:20.789]  Jay in Tennessee, you wanted to talk about how they're now talking about bio-attacks.
[01:57:20.849 --> 01:57:21.069]  Yes.
[01:57:21.629 --> 01:57:23.670]  Getting you all ready for relocation.
[01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:24.230]  Already.
[01:57:24.710 --> 01:57:30.292]  While in the real world, they're training the troops, the clergy, the firemen, everybody else for it.
[01:57:35.367 --> 01:57:37.468]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:37.988 --> 01:57:41.329]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.152 --> 01:57:50.792]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.452 --> 01:57:52.592]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.233 --> 01:57:54.333]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.973 --> 01:57:55.813]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.554 --> 01:57:57.334]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.127 --> 01:58:02.128]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.288 --> 01:58:06.409]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.850 --> 01:58:10.690]  Welcome, Ari, into the third and final hour.
[01:58:10.730 --> 01:58:17.372]  I will play this clip dealing with Prozac type drugs and suicide, several rock ball clips, a bunch of economic news.
[01:58:17.412 --> 01:58:18.632]  We're also taking your phone calls.
[01:58:19.132 --> 01:58:26.174]  Jay brought up the lone gunman pilot, and then it had a season after that.
[01:58:27.142 --> 01:58:38.429]  That aired about five and a half months before 9-11, and I've had Dean Hagelin here on air saying the CIA would come to them and plant, and NASA would call them and say, we want this in your episode.
[01:58:38.449 --> 01:58:42.932]  And then Offair, he told me even more, but I'm not at liberty to talk about it.
[01:58:42.952 --> 01:58:48.535]  The point is, is that the government came to him and said, let's have, well you've heard him on air, you've seen the video interviews.
[01:58:49.761 --> 01:59:00.728]  A episode where the government runs drills to make NORAD stand down as a cover to hijack a jumbo jet by remote control and fly to the World Trade Center because the Cold War is over and they want to start a war against Islamofascist.
[01:59:02.589 --> 01:59:03.770]  And then exactly that happens.
[01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:11.434]  And then they had a Philips TV ad where a F-16 flies over and blows up the World Trade Center in the months before.
[01:59:11.955 --> 01:59:16.257]  I mean, literally, I'm just guesstimating, more than 50, 60 examples.
[01:59:16.277 --> 01:59:17.258]  You start getting into them,
[01:59:19.423 --> 01:59:27.229]  And then you add to that the neocons writing public papers saying, the Vice President, we need a huge terror attack to get the people to go along with Pax Americana.
[01:59:28.089 --> 01:59:36.875]  And then we've got now the neocons and Republican memos and governors and senators writing news articles saying 9-11 was wonderful, we sure need another one for our agenda.
[01:59:37.236 --> 01:59:40.918]  I mean, they've entered a new phase of just thinly veiled.
[01:59:42.099 --> 01:59:48.924]  Remember two months ago, Gary Hart, who sits on the CFR board that wrote up the plans for Homeland Security?
[01:59:50.066 --> 01:59:52.166]  Years before 9-11 even happened?
[01:59:54.147 --> 01:59:57.747]  Saying we need to use this disaster to create a new world order?
[01:59:58.948 --> 02:00:04.949]  And Hart writes a letter to Ahmadinejad saying, you better submit to us and do whatever we say.
[02:00:06.049 --> 02:00:10.349]  Our government staged the Gulf of Tonkin, you know, staged other events.
[02:00:11.070 --> 02:00:15.390]  Just because the majority of our people don't want war with you now doesn't mean there can't be a provocation.
[02:00:15.690 --> 02:00:19.231]  And the question you've got to ask yourself is, will our government stage events?
[02:00:19.915 --> 02:00:21.897]  I mean, that isn't even veiled!
[02:00:24.019 --> 02:00:25.100]  And it was all over the news.
[02:00:26.061 --> 02:00:28.103]  I mean, they don't even veil it!
[02:00:29.144 --> 02:00:30.365]  But I'm not supposed to talk about it.
[02:00:31.386 --> 02:00:38.712]  So they can just have a bio-release, whatever they want next, because I've always told you, the next event will be even bigger, and the next will be even bigger.
[02:00:39.193 --> 02:00:42.536]  And they'll get us more and more herded into compact cities, more and more controlled.
[02:00:43.857 --> 02:00:45.238]  I understand their operations.
[02:00:45.278 --> 02:00:45.799]  I've studied them.
[02:00:46.405 --> 02:00:50.109]  Believe me, if you did nothing but study the New World Order, you would be as informed.
[02:00:50.830 --> 02:00:54.334]  But going back to Jay in Tennessee, you want to comment on that?
[02:00:55.135 --> 02:00:56.196]  Yeah, I think it's interesting.
[02:00:56.556 --> 02:01:03.844]  Last time I read the statement about Stephen King, and I know that's old, but it just sort of prompted in me that this
[02:01:05.198 --> 02:01:05.619]  We're good to go.
[02:01:20.274 --> 02:01:30.236]  All these pop culture... And there's a crazy university scientist who wants to release the bioweapon, and you've got Bianca... Look, it's over, folks, okay?
[02:01:30.496 --> 02:01:37.257]  I'm telling the cops, the military, all of you, if they win, if you let them continue, you are going to be holding your dead children in your hands, okay?
[02:01:37.997 --> 02:01:38.937]  I mean, it's over!
[02:01:39.637 --> 02:01:40.038]  It's over!
[02:01:40.398 --> 02:01:41.178]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:01:42.718 --> 02:01:44.378]  No, I mean, it's just, it's everywhere.
[02:01:45.458 --> 02:01:48.119]  It doesn't have to be a biorelease, I'm not trying to...
[02:01:48.757 --> 02:01:52.540]  Well, I'll hold you over, because this is a key call, but let me just elaborate now.
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:53.440]  Well, you know what?
[02:01:53.460 --> 02:01:55.102]  Finish up, and then I'm going to elaborate after the break.
[02:01:55.742 --> 02:02:06.650]  Well, I was just going to say that the religion of that mindset that you're talking about, of the occultist, of the person who hates humanity, is that he can propitiate both principles.
[02:02:06.670 --> 02:02:07.871]  And this is what most people understand.
[02:02:07.911 --> 02:02:09.832]  They think, well, they're a man.
[02:02:09.872 --> 02:02:10.753]  They're good, right?
[02:02:10.833 --> 02:02:12.014]  They're a good person like me.
[02:02:12.694 --> 02:02:13.054]  Well, no.
[02:02:13.074 --> 02:02:16.457]  The mindset of this person is magical, if you will.
[02:02:17.276 --> 02:02:19.918]  They believe that you can play both sides of the fence.
[02:02:19.938 --> 02:02:22.139]  You can swing both ways religiously.
[02:02:22.299 --> 02:02:23.259]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:02:24.220 --> 02:02:25.741]  They believe in, quote, balance.
[02:02:25.841 --> 02:02:27.161]  Having a dark side and a light side.
[02:02:27.181 --> 02:02:32.544]  And they believe whoever kills the most people... That's why they admire Hitler and Mao and the rest of them.
[02:02:33.365 --> 02:02:36.346]  They believe if they can kill the most people, they will be the most powerful.
[02:02:37.687 --> 02:02:38.047]  Stay there.
[02:02:38.087 --> 02:02:38.648]  We'll explain it.
[02:02:45.999 --> 02:02:47.380]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:49.522]  A New World Order.
[02:02:50.243 --> 02:02:54.447]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:02:55.128 --> 02:02:56.949]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:02:57.950 --> 02:03:00.192]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[02:03:00.753 --> 02:03:03.195]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:03.916 --> 02:03:11.262]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:14.255 --> 02:03:19.238]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:19.719 --> 02:03:23.181]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:23.581 --> 02:03:26.103]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[02:03:26.143 --> 02:03:27.284]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:27.304 --> 02:03:28.064]  They're not after money.
[02:03:28.084 --> 02:03:29.165]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:29.365 --> 02:03:30.106]  They're after power.
[02:03:30.366 --> 02:03:31.386]  That's what they're after.

[02:04:46.511 --> 02:04:51.932]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:04:52.352 --> 02:04:57.093]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:04:57.493 --> 02:05:00.114]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:05:00.614 --> 02:05:04.015]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:05:04.775 --> 02:05:09.096]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:05:09.556 --> 02:05:12.736]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:05:13.336 --> 02:05:16.177]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:05:16.954 --> 02:05:19.095]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:19.135 --> 02:05:20.896]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:05:20.916 --> 02:05:21.016]  U.S.
[02:05:21.116 --> 02:05:23.337]  Debt Bubble Rent Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[02:05:23.357 --> 02:05:23.637]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[02:05:23.657 --> 02:05:24.538]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:05:24.558 --> 02:05:25.218]  Ask for George.
[02:05:50.046 --> 02:05:50.687]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.347 --> 02:05:52.428]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.108 --> 02:05:54.229]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:55.710]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.451 --> 02:05:57.472]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.012 --> 02:06:01.995]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.215 --> 02:06:06.338]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.419 --> 02:06:12.022]  I want to be clear.
[02:06:12.042 --> 02:06:14.264]  I don't believe in all this magical stuff.
[02:06:14.304 --> 02:06:15.265]  The elite do.
[02:06:16.126 --> 02:06:19.188]  Read official United Nations Biological Diversity Assessments.
[02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:27.315]  It talks about how they must do mass rituals to save the earth, and how human sacrifice needs to be reinstated.
[02:06:27.655 --> 02:06:32.118]  You can't make... I say this a lot, and people make jokes about it, but it's true.
[02:06:32.158 --> 02:06:34.039]  You can't make this type of stuff up.
[02:06:34.979 --> 02:06:40.743]  It's so out in the open, it's so crazy, and they believe that they have to warn you first.
[02:06:40.783 --> 02:06:44.325]  They have to leave right out in the open clues, repeatedly.
[02:06:45.114 --> 02:06:50.758]  Of what they're going to do, and they also believe that it's revelation of the method that it prepares your subconscious.
[02:06:51.538 --> 02:06:59.123]  And you see a movie like, I Am Legend, based on a 1950s book that's been a mega-man and a bunch of others.
[02:07:00.844 --> 02:07:04.367]  And it's all about martial law, crackdowns on cities, everybody died.
[02:07:04.387 --> 02:07:08.569]  They even admit that it's a cure for cancer virus that goes wild.
[02:07:09.610 --> 02:07:12.672]  It's a cancer virus that makes you immune to cancer.
[02:07:13.972 --> 02:07:24.198]  And then it kills 90% of the world's population, and then 10% is left, but only 2% is immune.
[02:07:24.499 --> 02:07:27.260]  The other 8% turn into just psychopathic killers.
[02:07:28.681 --> 02:07:30.042]  Just absolutely crazed.
[02:07:32.123 --> 02:07:33.984]  But see, it's not big in Hollywood with this stuff.
[02:07:34.025 --> 02:07:39.168]  No, you just get diabetes, you just get Crohn's disease, you just get cancers all over you, and you just die.
[02:07:39.368 --> 02:07:40.609]  There's nothing fancy about it.
[02:07:43.743 --> 02:07:48.824]  You're not going to be bench pressing 800 pounds like I am legend when you're flopping around dying in your house.
[02:07:49.884 --> 02:07:51.865]  And the government's running around posing as saviors.
[02:07:52.145 --> 02:07:56.066]  And the military and police and firemen think they're trying to save people as they're dropping dead.
[02:07:56.106 --> 02:08:03.887]  And they get the news that mama and daddy and their wife and their kids are all dead back in Tennessee or Texas or New York.
[02:08:06.548 --> 02:08:09.529]  And I know you're going to cry your guts out years from now if the globalists do this.
[02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:11.729]  And a lot of you are going to wake up at that point.
[02:08:12.463 --> 02:08:19.965]  That's the big thing we got going for us, is that the globalists are probably just going to go ahead and do all this, the way things look right now.
[02:08:21.085 --> 02:08:25.766]  And people can self-censor and not talk about 9-11, and they can self-censor and try to be mainline.
[02:08:26.026 --> 02:08:27.486]  That's fine, you'll be flopping around dying.
[02:08:28.786 --> 02:08:40.469]  But when all that happens, and when you're burying your children, God forbid, trying to get real here with you, then you're going to remember old Alex Jones.
[02:08:40.509 --> 02:08:41.709]  He'll probably be long gone then.
[02:08:43.391 --> 02:08:46.392]  And you'll remember and go, man, that guy said all this was going to happen.
[02:08:48.072 --> 02:08:51.373]  And yes, they clearly have it in the cards.
[02:08:51.413 --> 02:08:53.014]  They've said we're going to have a bio-release.
[02:08:53.494 --> 02:08:57.155]  Bush has said, I don't know what will happen under him or Hillary or whoever else comes.
[02:08:57.715 --> 02:08:59.155]  The point is, it's on the table.
[02:09:00.256 --> 02:09:04.697]  And, you know, in I Am Legend, they not only have
[02:09:06.165 --> 02:09:09.027]  Uh, comments about martial law and forced relocation.
[02:09:09.367 --> 02:09:15.730]  They cut to, I guess, Shrek 2 or Shrek 3, I haven't seen it, where the donkey's talking to the ogre about relocation.
[02:09:15.750 --> 02:09:18.151]  They're trying to take him to a relocation camp.
[02:09:21.032 --> 02:09:22.833]  I mean, the whole movie, in fact, Rob's seen it.
[02:09:22.853 --> 02:09:23.834]  Hey, call Rob in here!
[02:09:23.854 --> 02:09:24.474]  Aaron!
[02:09:24.634 --> 02:09:25.834]  Can't hear him, he's got a headset on.
[02:09:26.215 --> 02:09:26.555]  Hold on.
[02:09:30.176 --> 02:09:31.097]  Here comes Rob Jacobson.
[02:09:32.653 --> 02:09:37.054]  I mean, I asked what he thought of the movie, and he laid out exactly what I thought, with precision.
[02:09:37.074 --> 02:09:38.094]  He's a really smart guy.
[02:09:39.615 --> 02:09:42.575]  And he said exactly what I thought, word for word.
[02:09:42.635 --> 02:09:45.216]  It's always Paul Watson-similar to having the same view.
[02:09:45.236 --> 02:09:50.617]  And it's not that we copy each other, because evidence by seeing something new and having the same view.
[02:09:51.898 --> 02:09:57.519]  It's that we can see something entirely new and give the same analysis, because we understand these people.
[02:09:57.981 --> 02:10:01.962]  Now Rob couldn't do that three or four years ago, now he can because he's really been immersed in this and he's a smart guy.
[02:10:02.482 --> 02:10:06.603]  Any of you can do this if you've got a good brain and just even an average intelligence.
[02:10:07.384 --> 02:10:08.764]  If you try to tune in to the reality.
[02:10:08.784 --> 02:10:15.386]  I'm going to go back to Jay here in a minute, but he brought up something really important, all this esoteric stuff, but it's everywhere.
[02:10:16.346 --> 02:10:18.667]  And so it prepares you for martial law, prepares you.
[02:10:19.128 --> 02:10:26.111]  You know, even something horrible and scary, the psychological study shows, prepares you to deal with it when it actually happens.
[02:10:26.391 --> 02:10:32.134]  Because they're worried about how you're going to panic when they release, you know, the Vectron 9 virus, or whatever it's going to be called.
[02:10:33.175 --> 02:10:36.296]  And I predict, the first waves, well I predicted this and then it happened.
[02:10:36.356 --> 02:10:39.738]  SARS, bird flu, they only kill a few hundred here and there.
[02:10:40.178 --> 02:10:41.199]  It's still real deadly.
[02:10:42.051 --> 02:10:46.053]  They have practice lockdown drills, they save us, and the next attacks get bigger.
[02:10:46.073 --> 02:10:50.735]  A thousand die, twenty thousand die, a hundred thousand die, a few years later a million die.
[02:10:51.175 --> 02:10:54.317]  We're all in compact cities being scanned and controlled, tracked.
[02:10:55.478 --> 02:10:59.660]  The elite, again, spray us and put in our food and water compounds so we have it.
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:07.123]  Because they're all going to be sprayed themselves, so we have to already have half the compound in us, then we're given the other compound.
[02:11:07.844 --> 02:11:10.645]  I tend to think it's actually going to be chemical and they're going to claim it's biological.
[02:11:11.406 --> 02:11:13.847]  Uh, from a lot of the things I've seen, uh, that they do.
[02:11:13.867 --> 02:11:17.388]  Uh, they've got the Genome Project down to specific bioweapons.
[02:11:17.408 --> 02:11:19.569]  Dick Cheney says they want to use race-specific bioweapons.
[02:11:19.929 --> 02:11:21.270]  Rob, you saw I Am Legend.
[02:11:21.290 --> 02:11:22.210]  Uh, break it down for people.
[02:11:23.130 --> 02:11:31.913]  Uh, yeah, that was, uh, pretty frightening, uh, kind of esoteric messages, kind of dotted throughout the entire film, from the very beginning right up to the very end.
[02:11:31.933 --> 02:11:36.255]  Um, it was kind of trippy to kind of try to watch that film and, uh,
[02:11:37.265 --> 02:11:37.646]  I think so.
[02:11:51.198 --> 02:11:59.669]  Very near future to speeches that Will Smith said, including, uh, everybody is dead and there is no God and all this kind of occultic kind of stuff.
[02:11:59.709 --> 02:12:00.370]  And 90% of us died.
[02:12:01.231 --> 02:12:03.113]  Of course, it's the exact number they're pushing for.
[02:12:03.294 --> 02:12:03.794]  Exactly.
[02:12:04.075 --> 02:12:04.916]  And 90% die.
[02:12:05.256 --> 02:12:08.961]  There's a couple of people that survive, but they are devoured by, uh,
[02:12:09.505 --> 02:12:15.051]  You know, those who are infected by the disease and so on and so forth, and there's a small population.
[02:12:15.071 --> 02:12:16.232]  Which will happen in real life.
[02:12:16.312 --> 02:12:18.314]  The riots, the burning, they won't need to be ghouls.
[02:12:18.655 --> 02:12:19.155]  Exactly.
[02:12:19.175 --> 02:12:25.702]  I mean, it's just sort of like they laid out their plan and they played it forward for everybody with this story.
[02:12:26.363 --> 02:12:30.527]  You know, this kind of comic book level story that just kind of played their agenda forward.
[02:12:30.848 --> 02:12:36.093]  And then they dotted it with all this symbolism throughout it, and it was really difficult to ignore it.
[02:12:36.153 --> 02:12:44.902]  But when he's giving the speech about the great evil behind him, the Chase Manhattan building, the only visible building, they show a Batman symbol superimposed over a Superman symbol.
[02:12:45.122 --> 02:12:46.844]  Everybody went, ooh, is that movie coming out?
[02:12:47.245 --> 02:12:48.486]  I mean, these guys don't play games.
[02:12:48.586 --> 02:12:49.507]  It's like, well,
[02:12:50.467 --> 02:12:51.167]  Yeah.
[02:12:51.268 --> 02:12:56.571]  And Negan playing the very same role in Oil Storm months before it actually happened.
[02:12:56.691 --> 02:12:56.911]  Right.
[02:12:56.931 --> 02:13:05.176]  It's like that Batman-Superman symbol, which may seem to most people like, oh, obvious, just movie promo kind of stuff inside a movie.
[02:13:05.777 --> 02:13:14.362]  If you think about it, it was a little troubling to me to see it because everybody in the theater was affected by the Batman promo that was happening just before the film.
[02:13:14.802 --> 02:13:19.305]  And then you see this futuristic promo going on in a futuristic film about
[02:13:20.057 --> 02:13:27.841]  A virus that kills everybody, allegedly in only a few years from now, and here's a film that they're going to release in just a few years from now.
[02:13:28.562 --> 02:13:31.844]  You know, it's a controlled environment in that film.
[02:13:32.244 --> 02:13:33.364]  They control everything.
[02:13:33.384 --> 02:13:37.567]  You just learned to notice things, and this thing was a threat.
[02:13:37.687 --> 02:13:39.308]  I mean, you know, other films have a little thing.
[02:13:39.368 --> 02:13:42.389]  I mean, this whole thing had mind control written all over it.
[02:13:42.930 --> 02:13:43.330]  It did.
[02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:48.373]  It was really troubling to watch, and every time these symbols came up, I just, I felt kind of like, ugh.
[02:13:49.924 --> 02:13:51.285]  You know, saw Alex too.
[02:13:51.305 --> 02:13:52.426]  He noticed every single one.
[02:13:52.486 --> 02:13:57.309]  He was just like, oh my God, you know, because there were so many, there were so few and so obvious.
[02:13:57.769 --> 02:14:03.713]  They just, I mean, blatantly put it in our face that, bam, this is what's going to happen.
[02:14:03.753 --> 02:14:04.053]  Boom.
[02:14:04.954 --> 02:14:07.695]  Uh, we know that most people don't notice the symbolism.
[02:14:07.735 --> 02:14:10.337]  This is for our audience, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:14:10.377 --> 02:14:12.999]  And it's just, it just went on and on and on.
[02:14:13.119 --> 02:14:16.341]  And the story at the end, you know, it's the same old classic.
[02:14:17.205 --> 02:14:21.127]  Yeah, explain that at the end there is this elite little community.
[02:14:21.247 --> 02:14:22.047]  It's old world.
[02:14:22.087 --> 02:14:24.148]  The houses all look like from 300 years ago.
[02:14:24.549 --> 02:14:26.129]  Old church steeples.
[02:14:26.169 --> 02:14:27.870]  The earth has come back and is beautiful.
[02:14:27.930 --> 02:14:31.752]  It's a good thing that man all died because now this wonderful age can begin.
[02:14:32.032 --> 02:14:32.472]  Exactly.
[02:14:32.512 --> 02:14:40.036]  There's even this one shot right before they drive up to that little town where it's like the green trees, the blue sky for a second, you know.
[02:14:40.928 --> 02:14:54.679]  It just really reminded me of everything that we've been doing over here, talking about the environmentalist, the pantheonic kind of vision, that when the people are gone, the green earth will thrive, and it was just crazy how much, you know, just BAM!
[02:14:54.699 --> 02:14:58.902]  The people are gone, the green earth, and it just goes right along with this pantheonic vision.
[02:14:58.922 --> 02:15:03.526]  And I've got all these books and movies and videos out about this now, about how great it's going to be when we're all dead.
[02:15:04.367 --> 02:15:09.531]  Exactly, and it just isn't even, the point of view that they're pushing, the fact that they want to
[02:15:10.566 --> 02:15:17.690]  You know, when everybody's dead, when the death is alive, and, you know, the whole world is exterminated, then we'll have green trees.
[02:15:17.730 --> 02:15:24.834]  It's just crazy that they're pushing this and they're shining it up, and most people can't even see it because they're into that Batman-Superman sign.
[02:15:24.874 --> 02:15:25.915]  Well, they'll know when they're dying.
[02:15:26.235 --> 02:15:26.795]  Thank you, Rob.
[02:15:26.955 --> 02:15:28.276]  I appreciate you talking to us.
[02:15:28.296 --> 02:15:32.918]  Go ahead and finish up, Jay, and I've got to get to Mike, Dan, Ron, and others.
[02:15:32.958 --> 02:15:34.379]  Go ahead, finish up what you were saying, Jay.
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:39.242]  Speaking of the Batman image superimposed that you guys mentioned in the movie,
[02:15:39.975 --> 02:15:40.676]  I am legend.
[02:15:41.076 --> 02:15:42.357]  Think about also Batman.
[02:15:42.757 --> 02:15:44.158]  Batman Begins with Christian Bale.
[02:15:44.178 --> 02:15:46.279]  It came out a few years ago.
[02:15:46.299 --> 02:15:48.000]  What's the premise there in that one too?
[02:15:48.380 --> 02:16:00.648]  It's Liam Neeson, the head of a secret eastern society that comes and balances good and evil and they let loose, you know, it's not a bio-release, but it's a kind of a chemical release all through New York.
[02:16:01.588 --> 02:16:04.110]  Or Gotham City, not New York.
[02:16:05.131 --> 02:16:08.813]  So again, that same scenario keeps
[02:16:09.417 --> 02:16:13.538]  Keeps running its currents through, you know, our culture.
[02:16:13.618 --> 02:16:19.840]  And also, the others have written on this really good analyses.
[02:16:19.900 --> 02:16:23.501]  Craig Heimvigner and Michael Hoffman have written on this.
[02:16:24.481 --> 02:16:26.982]  But I'm like, I don't believe in magic, Alex.
[02:16:27.022 --> 02:16:28.843]  I think that these people do.
[02:16:28.863 --> 02:16:31.183]  I believe in it insofar as it's, you know, demonic.
[02:16:31.223 --> 02:16:34.724]  And demonic entities, you know, manifest themselves or whatever.
[02:16:38.052 --> 02:16:39.873]  The worldview itself is self-destructive.
[02:16:39.893 --> 02:16:43.835]  That's what's so amazing about it.
[02:16:43.875 --> 02:16:50.038]  It's a religion and worldview that is self-destructive, and yet the light's in that destruction.
[02:16:52.859 --> 02:16:58.882]  Well, they feed on the destruction, so they bring life from it for themselves and then always centralize their power to a greater level.
[02:16:58.902 --> 02:16:59.422]  Thank you, Jay.
[02:17:00.763 --> 02:17:01.183]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:17:01.866 --> 02:17:02.927]  Or do I have chaos, right?
[02:17:03.067 --> 02:17:04.007]  That's it, order out of chaos.
[02:17:04.027 --> 02:17:04.568]  Thanks for the call.
[02:17:04.588 --> 02:17:05.769]  Okay, now I'm going to try to move quicker.
[02:17:05.829 --> 02:17:09.371]  I dib and I get into these callers that bring up such central points.
[02:17:09.391 --> 02:17:16.335]  And if I'm going to talk about esoteric and symbolism and throwing in your face, I've got to give some background to you and really elaborate on them a little bit.
[02:17:17.236 --> 02:17:18.236]  But it is everywhere.
[02:17:18.256 --> 02:17:21.118]  It's their little game, their little joke.
[02:17:21.919 --> 02:17:26.942]  And again, they believe they get great power out of displaying what they're going to do before they do it.
[02:17:28.723 --> 02:17:37.326]  We're going to talk to Mike in Wyoming, Dan in Georgia, Ron in Nevada, and many others on the other side of this quick break.
[02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:50.048]  Ted Anderson from Midas December 18, 2007 Gold 890 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $825.08, $406.65 for half, $203.33 per quarter.
[02:17:50.068 --> 02:17:50.469]  That's $825.08, $406.65, and $203.33.
[02:17:59.801 --> 02:18:03.084]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[02:18:03.384 --> 02:18:07.588]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[02:18:07.968 --> 02:18:11.952]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[02:18:12.432 --> 02:18:14.254]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[02:18:14.754 --> 02:18:16.436]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[02:18:16.716 --> 02:18:22.717]  The ideas of strong currency ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[02:18:23.137 --> 02:18:29.898]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[02:18:30.218 --> 02:18:31.099]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[02:18:31.139 --> 02:18:31.939]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:31.959 --> 02:18:34.859]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[02:18:34.879 --> 02:18:35.139]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:35.159 --> 02:18:36.419]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[02:18:46.208 --> 02:18:48.069]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:18:48.209 --> 02:18:54.891]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:18:55.171 --> 02:19:03.333]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:19:03.553 --> 02:19:09.255]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:19:09.595 --> 02:19:09.875]  I think so.
[02:19:28.089 --> 02:19:28.409]  We're good.

[02:21:07.961 --> 02:21:08.341]  I don't think so.
[02:21:27.308 --> 02:21:28.789]  Christmas is coming, so don't delay!
[02:21:28.849 --> 02:21:30.270]  Go to Spyville.com.

[02:21:36.694 --> 02:21:38.075]  Way up north to the lights of night.
[02:21:38.095 --> 02:21:39.316]  Way up north to the lights of night.
[02:21:52.985 --> 02:22:01.467]  Yeah, that's where the Canamex 183 Napa Superhighways is going, being built.
[02:22:02.128 --> 02:22:03.768]  Connecting into existing roads.
[02:22:04.068 --> 02:22:07.509]  It's all over the official government documents, publicly being built.
[02:22:07.529 --> 02:22:09.970]  Doesn't exist if you ask the news.
[02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:11.850]  Yep.
[02:22:11.910 --> 02:22:18.972]  It's like they spray us with nerve gas all the time and kill American citizens, and it comes out later and they just go, hey, we're the government, we murder you.
[02:22:20.793 --> 02:22:21.353]  We love ya!
[02:22:21.573 --> 02:22:22.033]  Shut up!
[02:22:22.816 --> 02:22:23.897]  You want some radiation?
[02:22:24.257 --> 02:22:24.938]  Shut up!
[02:22:25.619 --> 02:22:27.200]  We've got automatic weapons!
[02:22:27.941 --> 02:22:29.922]  You're scum, you're animals, we rule you!
[02:22:30.983 --> 02:22:33.245]  Evidenced by the fact you aren't even aware of what we're doing!
[02:22:34.066 --> 02:22:34.867]  That's their attitude.
[02:22:36.028 --> 02:22:37.589]  Mike in Wyoming, welcome sir.
[02:22:39.411 --> 02:22:40.151]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:22:40.432 --> 02:22:41.472]  Hello, good to hear from you.
[02:22:42.754 --> 02:22:45.216]  This is going to be a pretty good segue to your previous caller.
[02:22:45.956 --> 02:22:49.880]  I want to recommend an author to you and his two books.
[02:22:50.838 --> 02:22:52.299]  The guy's name is David Livingston.
[02:22:52.660 --> 02:22:54.221]  I'm not sure, but I think he's Canadian.
[02:22:55.482 --> 02:23:00.125]  But there's Terrorism and the Illuminati, and his previous book, The Dying God.
[02:23:01.006 --> 02:23:03.448]  It's not what you might think it is from the title.
[02:23:03.928 --> 02:23:06.990]  And that incidentally is the title of his website.
[02:23:07.230 --> 02:23:08.672]  What does he say?
[02:23:09.072 --> 02:23:10.113]  TheDyingGod.com?
[02:23:10.813 --> 02:23:11.013]  Yes.
[02:23:11.794 --> 02:23:13.495]  And you can contact him through that website.
[02:23:13.995 --> 02:23:16.277]  He is interested in an interview by you.
[02:23:16.317 --> 02:23:19.279]  He knows who you are, and I think he would be dying to meet you.
[02:23:22.569 --> 02:23:36.117]  The evolution of the spiritual aspect, which is what I've been interested in, what drives these people, who their God really is, and how it evolved over history from Babylon on forward.
[02:23:36.217 --> 02:23:41.960]  Really, they worship Kali, a blood-drinking, murderous, but she's beautiful.
[02:23:42.020 --> 02:23:46.263]  It's not like the Indian god in that respect, a blood-drinking goddess.
[02:23:46.663 --> 02:23:50.105]  Yeah, and it's well-documented, it's well-written and scholarly.
[02:23:50.914 --> 02:23:53.755]  Oh, he says they worship a blood-drinking goddess?
[02:23:53.775 --> 02:23:56.256]  Well, then he got it right.
[02:23:56.276 --> 02:23:57.037]  In effect, he does.
[02:23:58.017 --> 02:24:13.423]  But terrorism and the Illuminati ties it directly into how these people are using phony Muslims, which is like we have phony Christians and phony Jews, to stage this clash of civilizations.
[02:24:14.824 --> 02:24:19.446]  But his previous book, The Dying God, deals more specifically with the evolution of this cult as a
[02:24:20.339 --> 02:24:21.360]  You know, pseudo-religion.
[02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:27.664]  So, if you're interested in getting into the heads of... Mike, you hadn't called in about a year, and then you called a few months ago.
[02:24:27.704 --> 02:24:28.685]  You're a medical doctor.
[02:24:29.065 --> 02:24:36.010]  What do you think of all the inculcation about how there's going to be a bio-attack, we're going to take all your rights when it happens, all these movies getting us ready?
[02:24:37.390 --> 02:24:38.151]  It's hard to know.
[02:24:38.171 --> 02:24:48.218]  I think they're... I think they want to keep us off balance, and so they keep putting these little veil threats out there, and you know, it's...
[02:24:49.068 --> 02:24:54.851]  I don't know why they're worrying about a North American Union if they're just planning to kill us all off.
[02:24:57.232 --> 02:25:00.133]  My guess is that most of this is just smoke and mirrors.
[02:25:00.373 --> 02:25:08.697]  Well, I mean, they're going to do those ops in the third world and then use the fear to set up, you know, when you say 80, 90 percent, well that leaves Europe and North America.
[02:25:09.058 --> 02:25:10.919]  Yeah.
[02:25:10.959 --> 02:25:14.340]  Incidentally, just on a side note, I emailed
[02:25:16.417 --> 02:25:18.659]  The morning show on CNN the other day, I was frustrated.
[02:25:19.499 --> 02:25:32.329]  Robin Mead, a very attractive lady, and the political commentator there, an oriental-looking guy, were talking about the Republican race, and they studiously avoided mentioning Ron Paul.
[02:25:32.929 --> 02:25:36.912]  I emailed them and said, why do you guys keep pretending that Ron Paul doesn't exist?
[02:25:37.652 --> 02:25:45.338]  And two days later, this morning, just before I'm leaving the door, they say, Mike in Wyoming has emailed us, and he asks,
[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:52.002]  Why do you keep pretending that Romney is ahead of Ron Paul?
[02:25:52.722 --> 02:25:56.664]  They morphed my question around to something that they wanted to address.
[02:25:57.605 --> 02:26:00.026]  Well, that's what they did with the YouTube questions.
[02:26:00.066 --> 02:26:02.087]  They took everybody's questions and then wrote new ones.
[02:26:02.387 --> 02:26:09.390]  Yeah, so they showed that Romney in some stupid poll was at 16% versus Ron Paul at 6%.
[02:26:10.130 --> 02:26:13.492]  But then, in fairness, they did acknowledge that Ron Paul had
[02:26:14.048 --> 02:26:15.049]  Yeah, I know, it's in their nature.
[02:26:15.069 --> 02:26:16.049]  Even when the truth would serve them better.
[02:26:16.069 --> 02:26:22.732]  Well, I mean, I wonder what all these... I mean, because you see these yuppies and people that love the system, they're hyper-competitive, they're crazed whenever you look in their eyes.
[02:26:41.644 --> 02:26:46.229]  And I just don't understand how they stay in that agitated state and how they're just so greedy to dominate everybody.
[02:26:46.649 --> 02:26:48.591]  I mean, do they think they're going to be part of this power system?
[02:26:50.433 --> 02:26:50.973]  Well, it must be.
[02:26:51.113 --> 02:27:05.067]  And that's what Weisshoff spoke to, you know, many years ago, how all these people expected that they were going to be lieutenants and they were going to be well rewarded, you know, when their plans were fulfilled, and how naive all these people were.
[02:27:07.063 --> 02:27:10.945]  And I think that's where you do an excellent job of breaking through that nonsense.
[02:27:11.145 --> 02:27:15.107]  Have you heard about all the national hosts now are saying I'm a Timothy McVeigh and need to be arrested?
[02:27:15.287 --> 02:27:16.047]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:27:16.448 --> 02:27:19.089]  But I mean, they only have to look at the French Revolution.
[02:27:20.069 --> 02:27:27.153]  You know, most of these guys will eat their own very quickly and there's no way that all these people are going to end up at the top of the heap.
[02:27:28.233 --> 02:27:29.414]  I hear you Mike, good to hear from you.
[02:27:29.454 --> 02:27:33.876]  More calls straight ahead and I will get to some of these audio clubs right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:36.195 --> 02:27:39.201]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.122 --> 02:27:42.827]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.737 --> 02:27:49.979]  The holidays are here, and that means extra food and extra weight gain.
[02:27:50.139 --> 02:27:52.680]  Why not make your New Year's resolution eat healthier?
[02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:57.623]  And the easiest and most delicious way to start is with your new Excalibur Dehydrator.
[02:27:57.643 --> 02:28:01.825]  The Excalibur Dehydrator makes eating healthy not only easy, but fun.
[02:28:01.925 --> 02:28:05.286]  You can use it with your favorite fruit, vegetables, fish, and meat.
[02:28:05.607 --> 02:28:11.269]  And the Excalibur Dehydrator cuts out the unnecessary salt, fat, and preservatives found in most grocery store foods.
[02:28:11.489 --> 02:28:14.771]  You can also use the Excalibur Dehydrator to make your own herbs.
[02:28:15.251 --> 02:28:15.852]  We're good to go!
[02:28:46.627 --> 02:28:48.308]  Do you need an easier way to stay in touch?
[02:28:48.588 --> 02:28:50.269]  A two-way radio may be for you.
[02:28:50.469 --> 02:28:54.470]  Two-way radios provide short-range communication with no recurring service charges.
[02:28:54.690 --> 02:28:57.732]  Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and skiing.
[02:28:57.892 --> 02:29:01.733]  Great for amusement parks, cruises, or just keeping up with the kids around the neighborhood.
[02:29:01.874 --> 02:29:04.275]  Two-way radios can also make your business more efficient.
[02:29:04.395 --> 02:29:07.636]  Cut costs while increasing productivity in doctor and dental offices.
[02:29:07.756 --> 02:29:08.016]  I think so.
[02:29:23.570 --> 02:29:24.211]  We're good to go.
[02:29:46.454 --> 02:29:47.094]  It's a fact.
[02:29:47.314 --> 02:29:54.798]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:29:54.918 --> 02:30:03.782]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[02:30:04.062 --> 02:30:14.587]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:30:14.847 --> 02:30:20.930]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[02:30:21.130 --> 02:30:26.153]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[02:30:26.333 --> 02:30:30.815]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[02:30:30.975 --> 02:30:32.736]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600
[02:30:34.997 --> 02:30:35.578]  We're good to go.
[02:30:48.366 --> 02:31:05.635]  The freezer man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry The interest is up and the stock market's down And you're only gettin' mugged if you go downtown
[02:31:11.297 --> 02:31:32.770]  I live back in the woods, you see A woman and the kids and the dogs and me I got a shotgun, a rifle and a four-wheel drive And a country boy can survive Country folks can survive
[02:31:36.761 --> 02:31:39.502]  I can plow a field all day long.
[02:31:39.602 --> 02:31:44.003]  I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn.
[02:31:45.143 --> 02:31:50.764]  We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too.
[02:31:50.784 --> 02:31:55.606]  Ain't too many things you don't boys can do.
[02:31:58.146 --> 02:32:04.308]  We grow good old tomatoes and homemade wine and country boy can survive.
[02:32:11.172 --> 02:32:12.593]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:32:12.613 --> 02:32:13.594]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:32:13.634 --> 02:32:21.018]  I'm going to take five more calls, then I'm going to play these clips and cover some other news.
[02:32:21.378 --> 02:32:24.320]  Who is up next here?
[02:32:24.360 --> 02:32:26.461]  Is that going to be Dan in Oregon?
[02:32:40.541 --> 02:32:41.141]  Oh, Georgia.
[02:32:41.261 --> 02:32:42.582]  Dan and Georgia, you're on the air.
[02:32:42.642 --> 02:32:43.042]  Go ahead.
[02:32:43.062 --> 02:32:45.643]  This is Alex.
[02:32:45.723 --> 02:32:47.223]  It's a real privilege to talk to you.
[02:32:47.843 --> 02:32:52.185]  I did get your video in-game and loose change final cut, and it was very, very good.
[02:32:52.985 --> 02:33:02.268]  I do want to say I appreciate you confronting that military person that was, you know, on the streets of New York, you know, trying to violate your constitutional rights in which you told him to go back to Russia.
[02:33:04.942 --> 02:33:15.891]  And I wanted to let you know that I am an official Moonbat on the Neil Bortz Show now, and I keep this 9-11 stirred up on a daily basis here on the Neil Bortz Show.
[02:33:15.931 --> 02:33:29.501]  You sound like the guy I heard that called in on the Best of They Replayed, who tried to plug Infowars.com, and you said, I didn't used to believe this guy, but I checked it out and it's true, and then he said Alex Jones is like Tim McVeigh and Charlie Manson.
[02:33:29.542 --> 02:33:29.942]  Was that you?
[02:33:30.819 --> 02:33:31.619]  That was not me.
[02:33:31.679 --> 02:33:33.701]  I wish it was, but it was not me.
[02:33:33.721 --> 02:33:35.521]  But I did get the info at wars.com.
[02:33:35.581 --> 02:33:36.942]  He allowed me to say it on the air.
[02:33:36.982 --> 02:33:37.763]  It's amazing.
[02:33:37.783 --> 02:33:43.105]  I want to let you know that my pastor, my church, we preach in the street.
[02:33:45.266 --> 02:33:51.610]  Our website is sonsofthunder.com and we've been arrested several times.
[02:33:52.730 --> 02:33:56.092]  We're not going there just to get arrested, but we are standing up for our rights.
[02:33:56.636 --> 02:34:01.079]  And we have several lawsuits, and one is against the city of Atlanta right now.
[02:34:01.099 --> 02:34:03.680]  You can go to our website and see those cases.
[02:34:04.180 --> 02:34:06.602]  But I just wanted to say I appreciate it.
[02:34:06.722 --> 02:34:13.085]  And I just believed this two months ago, Alex, and I'm grabbing everything I can about 9-11 and sharing it with people.
[02:34:13.566 --> 02:34:21.930]  And my pastor said I could pass out the loose change, final cut, I could pass it out on the street corner as we're preaching out there.
[02:34:22.371 --> 02:34:23.891]  I'm saying I appreciate it, Alex.
[02:34:23.911 --> 02:34:24.672]  Keep up the good work.
[02:34:25.359 --> 02:34:26.700]  Thank you, sir, and God bless you.
[02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:30.182]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:34:30.842 --> 02:34:33.083]  Let's talk to Ron in Nevada, and then Dorian.
[02:34:33.183 --> 02:34:34.003]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:34:35.004 --> 02:34:37.185]  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all.
[02:34:37.445 --> 02:34:38.786]  Oh, you just committed a thought crime.
[02:34:38.826 --> 02:34:39.526]  You said Christmas.
[02:34:40.407 --> 02:34:41.107]  Yeah, I know.
[02:34:41.127 --> 02:34:42.468]  You're going to put me in jail, right?
[02:34:43.769 --> 02:34:47.450]  I wanted to tell you about Ron Paul and the New World Order.
[02:34:49.251 --> 02:34:52.813]  There's a Northern Nevada program on.
[02:34:52.853 --> 02:34:54.274]  He was on a couple of times.
[02:34:55.149 --> 02:35:01.474]  And the first thing they made note of was that there was some guy that was supporting him.
[02:35:01.674 --> 02:35:03.395]  I don't remember the fellow's name.
[02:35:04.056 --> 02:35:06.598]  But he was sporting in gold.
[02:35:07.258 --> 02:35:13.583]  And the FBI was investigating this guy for the pretender war.
[02:35:13.623 --> 02:35:15.465]  Yeah, that was the Liberty Dollars.
[02:35:16.025 --> 02:35:23.611]  There's hundreds of mints putting out gold coins, but they said Ron Paul's picture was on it, and they said that that was competing with the Federal Reserve, yes.
[02:35:24.577 --> 02:35:33.803]  Yeah, then what they try to make it look like on a recent show was that Ron Paul is receiving the money.
[02:35:34.443 --> 02:35:40.326]  So that would make Ron Paul, you know, conspire with this guy.
[02:35:40.366 --> 02:35:45.369]  That's right, we've got Hillary with the Chinese generals giving her money again, that's okay.
[02:35:45.750 --> 02:35:51.833]  We've got all these big donors, but Ron Paul just raised $6.6 million in one day from on average $45 apiece donors.
[02:35:53.574 --> 02:36:04.360]  And yeah, I saw national news implying Ron Paul was involved with some type of criminal counterfeiting because some gold coin company was selling gold and silver coins with his picture on it.
[02:36:04.860 --> 02:36:09.322]  There are hundreds of companies that print up their own gold and silver coins.
[02:36:10.103 --> 02:36:11.083]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:36:11.183 --> 02:36:12.744]  Anyone who has half a brain knows that.
[02:36:12.764 --> 02:36:17.747]  But again, have you heard about the news reports of when you try to buy stuff with the $2 bill now, you get arrested?
[02:36:18.456 --> 02:36:20.797]  Because the shopkeepers think it's a counterfeit.
[02:36:21.237 --> 02:36:22.877]  And then the cops show up and don't know.
[02:36:22.957 --> 02:36:24.778]  The public is dumber than dirt.
[02:36:25.598 --> 02:36:28.919]  So they think gold coins printed up by somebody else are illegal.
[02:36:30.459 --> 02:36:34.621]  Well, but what they made it look like, that Ron Paul was receiving the money.
[02:36:34.721 --> 02:36:37.201]  And then he would be, you know, conspiring.
[02:36:38.482 --> 02:36:42.083]  If there's any charges, he didn't know what the charges were against the seller.
[02:36:42.563 --> 02:36:46.024]  But if there were charges, he would be, you know, a party to it.
[02:36:46.448 --> 02:36:46.989]  No, yes.
[02:36:47.009 --> 02:36:47.609]  Very evil.
[02:36:47.709 --> 02:36:48.249]  Very evil.
[02:36:48.269 --> 02:36:49.170]  I appreciate your call.
[02:36:50.131 --> 02:36:51.052]  Here's another example.
[02:36:51.352 --> 02:36:53.433]  I have a shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[02:36:53.473 --> 02:36:54.594]  It's a Yahoo shopping cart.
[02:36:54.654 --> 02:36:55.535]  It's got the highest security.
[02:36:55.555 --> 02:36:56.856]  It's what we have a Yahoo shopping cart.
[02:36:57.897 --> 02:37:00.659]  But every day there's three or four fake orders on there.
[02:37:02.800 --> 02:37:06.343]  I mean, in off days I'll come in here and we'll have only like 20 orders and three or four of them will be fake.
[02:37:07.003 --> 02:37:09.845]  And what they're doing is they're not trying to get my videos or books.
[02:37:10.646 --> 02:37:13.248]  They go in to Amazon.
[02:37:13.628 --> 02:37:15.730]  Amazon supposedly has hundreds of thousands a week of these.
[02:37:17.228 --> 02:37:18.789]  And they test credit card numbers.
[02:37:18.809 --> 02:37:31.017]  Because what happens is, a lot of these predominantly foreign owned gas stations, when you swipe your card there, and this is the government admitting this, where most of the theft is, not the internet, they're testing the cards on the internet.
[02:37:31.797 --> 02:37:45.386]  Those guys at that gas station will then send it back to Indonesia, send it back to Nigeria, send it back to Algeria, send it back to Saudi Arabia, send it back to Israel, it's big on this, but nothing compared to the Asians.
[02:37:47.305 --> 02:37:49.606]  And then they've got a list of credit card numbers.
[02:37:49.646 --> 02:37:51.486]  Well, they're wanting to see if these numbers are good.
[02:37:53.046 --> 02:38:05.469]  Because a lot of times they've been canceled or they've been stolen or they'll have a list of thousands of credit cards that have been stolen from banks or fenced out of gas stations or shopping mall centers.
[02:38:06.949 --> 02:38:12.230]  And again, they don't take your card when you buy something from them and go buy stuff with it.
[02:38:12.351 --> 02:38:14.391]  They sell the number to their cousin.
[02:38:16.281 --> 02:38:20.005]  And so they go online and they test the cards, to make a long story short.
[02:38:20.786 --> 02:38:23.729]  And every day we got three or four of these, sometimes ten of them, but usually about three or four.
[02:38:24.110 --> 02:38:25.511]  And we go through and we see it's fake.
[02:38:25.531 --> 02:38:30.316]  You can see it's fake real fast, because they'll just put in baloney in their details or where it's being mailed to.
[02:38:30.797 --> 02:38:32.619]  They're just testing to see if the card goes through.
[02:38:33.763 --> 02:38:36.665]  Now the good part about our system is it doesn't actually run the card.
[02:38:36.725 --> 02:38:38.185]  It just tests it and accepts it.
[02:38:38.546 --> 02:38:41.247]  We have to do the final processing to actually charge your card.
[02:38:41.727 --> 02:38:45.909]  So people who have their cards stolen, their numbers stolen, you never know, you never get charged.
[02:38:46.290 --> 02:38:48.110]  Because we see it's fake and we hit delete.
[02:38:49.851 --> 02:38:53.333]  Ron Paul had four or five of those on his campaign website.
[02:38:54.034 --> 02:39:00.477]  And so they contacted the Texas-based bank that the card numbers had been taken from and said, hey, here this is.
[02:39:01.221 --> 02:39:05.664]  The bank put out a statement when the press asked saying, yeah, this is routine, they're testing cards, it happens to everybody.
[02:39:06.325 --> 02:39:10.488]  But National News said Ron Paul supporters involved in bank heist.
[02:39:10.948 --> 02:39:13.150]  And they acted like Ron Paul was robbing banks.
[02:39:14.511 --> 02:39:17.794]  Now anybody who has a shopping cart knows that's not true.
[02:39:18.474 --> 02:39:24.419]  Anybody who has an internet shopping cart knows that they test them on items that you sell.
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:28.802]  But the media knows the public is dumb enough
[02:39:29.716 --> 02:39:30.036]  I think so.
[02:39:48.701 --> 02:39:59.650]  It makes me mad that it's so easy to divert and distract and keep good people from doing meaningful work and being involved in waking other people up about real issues.
[02:40:00.511 --> 02:40:07.497]  I mean, we're in a sea of corruption, and most of our movement just ninnies and nitpicks on other people in the movement.
[02:40:10.979 --> 02:40:16.424]  I don't know, it was probably about two, three years ago, this one group of ne'er-do-wells
[02:40:18.231 --> 02:40:19.933]  And this is just an example of me personally.
[02:40:19.953 --> 02:40:21.234]  I just gave you two with Ron Paul.
[02:40:21.254 --> 02:40:22.815]  So learn how to look for stuff like this.
[02:40:24.256 --> 02:40:30.682]  They go out on the web and they say, Alex Jones works for ABC News.
[02:40:32.323 --> 02:40:32.984]  And their proof?
[02:40:33.905 --> 02:40:38.589]  Alex Jones' radio show is an affiliate of ABC.
[02:40:40.050 --> 02:40:41.131]  Now, that's not true.
[02:40:42.612 --> 02:40:48.097]  But just by saying that, since then other people get it, and then they add even more onto it.
[02:40:49.338 --> 02:40:56.825]  And then it's kind of like the game where you whisper one thing and somebody's ear and it goes around the table, and by the time it gets back around it's something completely different.
[02:40:59.187 --> 02:41:05.552]  And then these people will call me, they'll write me, I'll even try to send an email back, you know, listeners, and they'll go, you need to answer for this right now!
[02:41:06.793 --> 02:41:08.535]  And I'll say, well, we have, um,
[02:41:10.805 --> 02:41:14.107]  We used to have Stars Encore Satellite, and we leased a feed from them.
[02:41:15.468 --> 02:41:27.715]  We're on some K-Band deal that the people that we lease it from have a sub-channel on, and it's mainly international Christian broadcasting stuff, and there's people now saying we work for them.
[02:41:27.735 --> 02:41:33.399]  How this works, and I know station owners are really laughing at this.
[02:41:33.419 --> 02:41:35.400]  If you don't believe me, just call a radio station.
[02:41:37.199 --> 02:41:40.340]  And when the board operator answers, say, do you have a Star Guide receiver?
[02:41:40.680 --> 02:41:41.501]  And they'll say, yes.
[02:41:42.381 --> 02:41:43.381]  And they'll ask, why are you asking?
[02:41:43.441 --> 02:41:44.902]  Oh, I'm, you know, just doing a paper.
[02:41:44.962 --> 02:41:49.243]  Just, you know, get them to answer you.
[02:41:49.863 --> 02:41:51.003]  Or just say, I'm just curious.
[02:41:51.063 --> 02:41:53.664]  And say, is that how you get all your syndicated shows?
[02:41:53.684 --> 02:41:54.324]  And they'll say, yeah.
[02:41:55.425 --> 02:41:57.685]  And you can ask, are there different companies, different people on there?
[02:41:57.705 --> 02:41:58.386]  And they'll say, yeah.
[02:41:59.646 --> 02:42:05.868]  I mean, it's just like if I... I have a cell phone through AT&T.
[02:42:08.613 --> 02:42:12.776]  Now, I'm not an affiliate of ABC or AT&T.
[02:42:15.898 --> 02:42:22.241]  Ted Anderson goes for $5,000-something dollars a month, and he leases a feed, and they have thousands of feeds.
[02:42:23.202 --> 02:42:36.190]  You know, if your local college baseball team is putting their baseball games out over the local talk station and it's syndicated, chances are it's going over a Star Guide feed, and there's three Star Guide satellites, Jones, Clear Channel, and ABC.
[02:42:37.868 --> 02:42:39.809]  Jones is more expensive.
[02:42:40.529 --> 02:42:57.778]  Clear Channel, and Ted didn't know this the first time he leased one from them, they'll sell you the feed, but what they don't tell you is all Star Guide receivers that stations have only allow Star Guide programming down them, and so they'll never give you the access code to be able to even get your program out of the box.
[02:42:58.598 --> 02:42:59.919]  Station owners know about this too.
[02:43:00.539 --> 02:43:02.840]  So for a couple months, Ted had that and it was worthless.
[02:43:03.460 --> 02:43:04.301]  So we got ABC,
[02:43:06.067 --> 02:43:08.709]  They're the least expensive, and they've got the most feeds.
[02:43:08.729 --> 02:43:14.514]  There's thousands of shows, and so it'd be just like if you called up and you got phone service with somebody.
[02:43:16.336 --> 02:43:17.256]  But see, it doesn't matter.
[02:43:17.276 --> 02:43:22.721]  They know the public doesn't verify, doesn't check into things.
[02:43:23.642 --> 02:43:29.126]  And then it turns into, um, I work for ABC.
[02:43:30.968 --> 02:43:32.989]  I mean, Genesis is wholly owned by
[02:43:37.011 --> 02:43:37.771]  Ted Anderson.
[02:43:39.952 --> 02:43:42.053]  Ted Anderson has a corporation in Minnesota.
[02:43:43.173 --> 02:43:44.794]  No one else owns it but Ted Anderson.
[02:43:46.755 --> 02:43:47.835]  But see, that doesn't matter.
[02:43:48.996 --> 02:43:56.639]  Or there was another case about four years ago where there are hundreds of companies named Genesis.
[02:43:56.659 --> 02:44:02.241]  I mean, there's porno magazines named Genesis and there's communications companies named Genesis and there's
[02:44:03.146 --> 02:44:14.295]  And they found some deal where there was a Saudi Arabian owned some totally separate company called Genesis, and every day we get emails, this article says you're owned by Saudi Arabians, and we're like, no we're not.
[02:44:15.336 --> 02:44:24.022]  That's how the rumor that the IRS is incorporated in Delaware started, because in the 1930s there was a company incorporated IRS there.
[02:44:24.283 --> 02:44:30.968]  Doesn't matter the fellow reserved, and the IRS was around 20 years before, people found that corporate filing that said IRS,
[02:44:32.179 --> 02:44:32.979]  It doesn't matter.
[02:44:32.999 --> 02:44:43.443]  I mean, the point is, is I just see the things that people... And let's just say I was an affiliate and work for ABC, which I don't.
[02:44:45.103 --> 02:44:46.444]  You can verify that in ten seconds.
[02:44:47.544 --> 02:44:52.526]  Go look at the corporate filings for Genesis Communications Network in Minnesota.
[02:44:52.546 --> 02:44:55.887]  I mean, do some real research for once in your life.
[02:44:59.388 --> 02:45:00.048]  It doesn't matter.
[02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:01.629]  The point is, is that
[02:45:02.461 --> 02:45:05.624]  This is the type of stuff they're doing to Ron Paul, and it is effective.
[02:45:06.685 --> 02:45:12.230]  I mean, I've had so many emails and calls going, but he's involved in counterfeit gold.
[02:45:12.250 --> 02:45:14.633]  Number one, he's not involved with that company.
[02:45:14.653 --> 02:45:15.934]  That wasn't involved with the campaign.
[02:45:16.334 --> 02:45:16.795]  Number one.
[02:45:16.855 --> 02:45:24.622]  Number two, Ron Paul... It's just so incredible.
[02:45:26.704 --> 02:45:27.465]  It's just so incredible.
[02:45:28.212 --> 02:45:30.833]  So what if Ron Paul's face is on gold and silver coins?
[02:45:30.893 --> 02:45:35.735]  It's legal for you to go buy gold yourself and stamp the Easter Bunny on the front of it if you want.
[02:45:36.815 --> 02:45:37.736]  That's not illegal!
[02:45:39.116 --> 02:45:39.757]  It doesn't matter.
[02:45:39.777 --> 02:45:43.558]  It's just... I'm so frustrated for you out there, some of you out there.
[02:45:44.298 --> 02:45:45.819]  Because you just don't listen.
[02:45:45.839 --> 02:45:48.600]  Alright, you know what?
[02:45:48.620 --> 02:45:49.460]  I never got to the Clips.
[02:45:49.500 --> 02:45:50.361]  I never got to your calls.
[02:45:50.381 --> 02:45:52.301]  Let's just try to go to Dorian in South Carolina.
[02:45:52.702 --> 02:45:53.562]  Dorian, you're on the air.
[02:45:53.602 --> 02:45:53.982]  Go ahead.
[02:45:54.002 --> 02:45:55.563]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:45:55.883 --> 02:45:56.083]  Good.
[02:45:57.253 --> 02:46:06.155]  Um, I just wanted to, this is my first time calling in to your show, and uh, I just want to congratulate you on all the work that you do.
[02:46:06.895 --> 02:46:11.996]  I know it's hard for you, but, you know, just keep your head up, keep informing people.
[02:46:12.776 --> 02:46:13.416]  Well, God bless you.
[02:46:13.456 --> 02:46:14.437]  I'm trying my best, Dorian.
[02:46:14.457 --> 02:46:15.057]  What's on your mind?
[02:46:15.997 --> 02:46:23.959]  Uh, I'm kind of nervous, but, you know, I just appreciate you waking me up to 9-11 and, you know,
[02:46:25.504 --> 02:46:26.444]  I was really in the dark.
[02:46:26.484 --> 02:46:28.705]  I didn't know, you know, what to believe.
[02:46:30.206 --> 02:46:34.267]  I'm glad that your information, you know, kind of brought a new light to me.
[02:46:35.107 --> 02:46:44.730]  And, uh, you know, I'm just glad that you have a show with somebody like you, you know, to inform people.
[02:46:45.350 --> 02:46:48.812]  Because, you know, the media, you know how they spin things and lie.
[02:46:49.372 --> 02:46:53.153]  And I'm just glad you're here for the people to inform them, you know what I mean?
[02:46:53.959 --> 02:46:55.419]  Well, I'm trying my best, my friend.
[02:46:55.439 --> 02:46:56.380]  Yes, sir.
[02:46:57.520 --> 02:47:03.622]  And, uh, don't worry about, you know, the media saying that you are a conspiracy theorist and all that.
[02:47:04.202 --> 02:47:05.702]  Just keep doing what you do.
[02:47:06.903 --> 02:47:19.126]  There's a lot of people, I try to inform people on some of the words, you know, some of the things that you say in your ass, and like it's a joke and all, but if you look it up or Google it, man, it's actually on the internet, you know.
[02:47:20.478 --> 02:47:21.619]  Well, it's in government documents.
[02:47:21.659 --> 02:47:22.539]  It's mainstream news.
[02:47:22.919 --> 02:47:24.840]  Dorian, how did you come by my information?
[02:47:25.621 --> 02:47:28.542]  Uh, my older brother, he started listening to you about 2006.
[02:47:29.683 --> 02:47:34.906]  He's in the Coast Guard now, and he got a film.
[02:47:35.566 --> 02:47:39.929]  Uh, I forgot the name of the film, but I watched it.
[02:47:39.949 --> 02:47:44.311]  You know, it was about 9-11 and, uh, bohemian growth and all that type of stuff.
[02:47:45.192 --> 02:47:46.652]  And it really woke me up.
[02:47:46.853 --> 02:47:49.274]  And I got, I got your film, Endgame.
[02:47:50.165 --> 02:47:51.085]  You know, I watched it.
[02:47:51.105 --> 02:47:52.346]  It's a pretty good film.
[02:47:52.366 --> 02:47:57.407]  There's some pretty bad stuff going on that they're trying to do to us, but... It's a good film.
[02:47:57.427 --> 02:48:00.407]  And, uh, I was gonna make some copies of it.
[02:48:00.888 --> 02:48:06.049]  I hadn't watched the whole thing, but... I just came across you on the internet, on m4wars.com.
[02:48:06.229 --> 02:48:08.389]  And I think you're a good man.
[02:48:08.409 --> 02:48:16.151]  Just don't worry about these crazy people out here in the media, Fox News especially, cause... They don't really know anything.
[02:48:16.191 --> 02:48:17.732]  They're just tricking the people.
[02:48:18.012 --> 02:48:18.672]  Brainwashing.
[02:48:18.752 --> 02:48:19.032]  You know?
[02:48:20.518 --> 02:48:21.599]  You're absolutely right, Dorian.
[02:48:21.619 --> 02:48:23.060]  Good to have you on board, and God bless you.
[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:24.601]  Keep spreading the word about the broadcast.
[02:48:25.601 --> 02:48:28.263]  Um... You know, my point was about ABC.
[02:48:29.104 --> 02:48:30.765]  I'm not an affiliate of ABC.
[02:48:30.825 --> 02:48:33.006]  We lease a feed that you can go lease.
[02:48:33.086 --> 02:48:39.410]  You know, the way for you peons out there to find out about this, is why don't you contact them yourself, and go lease a feed from them.
[02:48:40.171 --> 02:48:43.573]  But the point is, I'm telling the truth, so how does it matter how I'm delivered to you?
[02:48:46.315 --> 02:48:47.716]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:48.776 --> 02:48:49.777]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.527 --> 02:48:55.728]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:55.748 --> 02:48:57.169]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:48:58.229 --> 02:49:00.470]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:03.470]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.211 --> 02:49:11.532]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.548 --> 02:49:19.551]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.032 --> 02:49:23.494]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:23.874 --> 02:49:26.376]  Bill Burdick is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:26.456 --> 02:49:27.596]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.616 --> 02:49:28.377]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.397 --> 02:49:29.477]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:29.678 --> 02:49:30.418]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.658 --> 02:49:31.499]  That's what they're after, you see.
[02:49:31.799 --> 02:49:40.004]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:40.144 --> 02:49:40.925]  Endgame.

[02:50:34.620 --> 02:50:35.481]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:45.459 --> 02:50:49.723]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:50:49.983 --> 02:50:54.867]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:50:55.088 --> 02:50:56.389]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:56.589 --> 02:50:59.972]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:51:20.349 --> 02:51:21.290]  No animal testing.
[02:51:21.570 --> 02:51:22.871]  I use them and love them.
[02:51:22.891 --> 02:51:24.493]  Knowing they're all naturally safe.

[02:51:46.410 --> 02:51:50.113]  This free-flowing stretch of roadway could be a toll collection problem.
[02:51:50.794 --> 02:51:55.458]  None of these drivers need stop to pay toll, slow down, or hunt for change.
[02:51:56.178 --> 02:51:59.481]  But all tolls will be collected and violators will be fighted.
[02:52:00.234 --> 02:52:10.039]  It all happens electronically in a system designed and developed in Orange County, California by Hughes Aircraft Company, a General Motors subsidiary.
[02:52:11.059 --> 02:52:14.201]  Toll booths, stop and start traffic, barriers.
[02:52:14.821 --> 02:52:19.003]  These are all familiar to anyone traveling on our nation's conventional toll roads.
[02:52:19.703 --> 02:52:25.306]  But Hughes has replaced all this with a sleek, unobtrusive gantry spanning the roadway.
[02:52:26.354 --> 02:52:27.494]  At the heart of the system.
[02:52:27.594 --> 02:52:30.695]  There they are admitting existing, tolling existing roads.
[02:52:30.715 --> 02:52:32.255]  That's from like 15 years ago.
[02:52:32.275 --> 02:52:34.736]  And it's all the military-industrial complex.
[02:52:34.756 --> 02:52:38.677]  They just come by all politicians, have them hand over the roads to them, and make trill.
[02:52:39.037 --> 02:52:39.637]  Make trillions.
[02:52:40.437 --> 02:52:41.077]  In the aggregate.
[02:52:41.237 --> 02:52:42.017]  They don't play games.
[02:52:42.037 --> 02:52:43.178]  And this is an eight minute clip.
[02:52:43.578 --> 02:52:45.038]  It's up on prisonplanet.com.
[02:52:45.098 --> 02:52:46.278]  I meant to go over more of it.
[02:52:47.058 --> 02:52:50.399]  But, you know, they act, oh, did the drug companies know?
[02:52:50.439 --> 02:52:51.959]  Did they know it caused suicide?
[02:52:51.979 --> 02:52:54.100]  Well, it turns out they did.
[02:52:55.090 --> 02:52:58.511]  Um, but then they say, oh, if it's not properly given, it's not good.
[02:52:58.971 --> 02:53:01.452]  No, it causes depression, and they know it.
[02:53:01.492 --> 02:53:01.912]  Here it is.
[02:53:03.333 --> 02:53:03.833]  This is 9-1-1.
[02:53:03.873 --> 02:53:04.873]  Who is this?
[02:53:11.635 --> 02:53:12.476]  Where is your sister?
[02:53:12.516 --> 02:53:13.256]  What is she trying to do?
[02:53:13.296 --> 02:53:13.756]  Take pills?
[02:53:14.503 --> 02:53:15.004]  I was.
[02:53:15.144 --> 02:53:17.165]  Now my dad's home now.
[02:53:17.245 --> 02:53:18.026]  Oh my God!
[02:53:18.286 --> 02:53:18.887]  A baby!
[02:53:19.067 --> 02:53:19.908]  Oh my God!
[02:53:20.268 --> 02:53:21.789]  Oh my God!
[02:53:21.929 --> 02:53:29.295]  Our beautiful little girl Candace died by hanging four days after ingesting 100 milligrams of Zoloft.
[02:53:29.355 --> 02:53:35.000]  Matt violently and with great difficulty took his own life.
[02:53:35.040 --> 02:53:36.962]  She ended the night by cutting her wrist.
[02:53:38.223 --> 02:53:40.725]  I found Jacob hanging from the rafter in our attic.
[02:53:41.497 --> 02:53:45.899]  It wasn't the disease that caused my daughter to viciously mutilate herself.
[02:53:46.019 --> 02:53:46.940]  It was the drug.
[02:53:47.460 --> 02:53:52.723]  These parents believed the drug companies had evidence there was a risk, but never told them.
[02:53:53.183 --> 02:53:57.465]  I'd like to introduce you to my daughter, Caitlin Elizabeth McIntosh.
[02:53:58.526 --> 02:54:03.469]  Well, it's actually only a two-dimensional image of her, but it's all I have left.
[02:54:04.189 --> 02:54:09.732]  She died of suicide at age 12 years and 3 months, just 8 weeks after being put on Paxil.
[02:54:10.160 --> 02:54:21.551]  I'm going to play all of it tomorrow and comment on it, but they now have to put it in the inserts that it causes violent outbreaks, suicide, psychopathic breaks.
[02:54:22.292 --> 02:54:23.133]  They already knew this.
[02:54:23.173 --> 02:54:26.136]  They knew this when the head of the company got it approved.
[02:54:26.176 --> 02:54:29.779]  That was Donald Rumsfeld in 1983, the first big drug on this line.
[02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:31.601]  And they know what they're doing.
[02:54:31.641 --> 02:54:32.342]  That's why they rule us.
[02:54:33.803 --> 02:54:41.969]  And then when you get depressed on the first bout, then they put you on more, more, more, more, and after a few years, you're on average of four of these, children on average of seven.
[02:54:43.591 --> 02:54:49.956]  And you look at the molecular makeup of these drugs, much more deadly than heroin or cocaine.
[02:54:51.337 --> 02:54:56.501]  And they also, you're what, four times more likely to get on illegal drugs after you've been on these classes of drugs.
[02:54:56.521 --> 02:55:00.844]  But it's also the physical things, they're very bad for your body.
[02:55:02.057 --> 02:55:05.678]  But you notice the parents still think their daughter had a disease of being depressed.
[02:55:05.699 --> 02:55:08.960]  You know, there are hundreds of new mental diseases every year.
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:16.243]  We're all mentally ill, and none of us who are mentally ill can own guns, and this new superclass of psychiatrists will rule over us.
[02:55:17.523 --> 02:55:18.944]  We're out of time, folks.
[02:55:19.024 --> 02:55:20.004]  Man, this is good therapy.
[02:55:20.204 --> 02:55:24.906]  I was really sick this morning, and I came in here to the show, and I felt a lot better by the end of the show.
[02:55:24.926 --> 02:55:27.087]  I still feel like, you know, really bad.
[02:55:27.947 --> 02:55:30.468]  But I feel a lot better.
[02:55:30.568 --> 02:55:31.669]  I'll be here live tomorrow.
[02:55:32.925 --> 02:55:35.207]  And we do have some big guests coming up throughout the week.
