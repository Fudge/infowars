[00:00:05.747 --> 00:00:06.367]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.047 --> 00:00:08.107]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:09.908]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.568 --> 00:00:11.389]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:13.049]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.371]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:21.992]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.784 --> 00:00:58.310]  All right, man, I am so busy crawling around, literally on the floor, picking up a stack of news that slid off of my desk that I was about to cover, and I barely made it here on air on time.
[00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:12.669]  It is the seventh day of May 2007 and we're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:01:18.012 --> 00:01:21.354]  We have a very important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:01:21.374 --> 00:01:25.056]  We'll spend some time on Nicholas Sarkozy.
[00:01:26.946 --> 00:01:40.891]  Not that that's important, not that he himself is important as a complete and total puppet, but it's important to look at that whole process, the Invisible Empire processes that we'll be going over.
[00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:50.414]  And then of course the really big news of the day that I will cover from the bottom of this hour into the bottom of the next hour
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.021]  Unabated.
[00:01:52.441 --> 00:02:01.226]  We will not be taking calls, but then we will take calls in the second half of the next hour throughout the rest of the broadcast.
[00:02:01.267 --> 00:02:04.349]  But we won't have open phones for an hour and a half.
[00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.849]  Who knows?
[00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.551]  I may have opened them earlier, but that's tentative right now.
[00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:13.995]  What do I have here in front of me in my little stack?
[00:02:15.336 --> 00:02:15.596]  Well,
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.122]  Gore sees spiritual crisis in warming.
[00:02:25.123 --> 00:02:25.923]  Here's another one.
[00:02:26.103 --> 00:02:31.025]  Eco-extremist wants world population to drop below 1 billion.
[00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:33.546]  Here's another one.
[00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:37.168]  Children bad for planet.
[00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:39.149]  Here's another one.
[00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:39.969]  Times of London.
[00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.690]  Having large families is an eco-crime.
[00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:45.192]  Here's another one.
[00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:46.972]  The Queen treads lightly in US.
[00:02:47.012 --> 00:02:48.153]  Ties into the same thing.
[00:02:49.306 --> 00:02:56.130]  Another one, London Guardian, London Telegraph, world given deadline on climate change, world government agreement made.
[00:02:58.631 --> 00:03:03.654]  Here's another one, you can go and buy your carbon credits even though the taxes didn't force you.
[00:03:06.676 --> 00:03:09.338]  We'll be going over this for you.
[00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.982]  When I get up here and I say they have a plan for a one-child policy to start,
[00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:24.964]  And to have a child, you're going to have to pay millions of dollars of taxes.
[00:03:27.845 --> 00:03:30.066]  Now, you're thinking that's not going to happen.
[00:03:30.106 --> 00:03:36.889]  You probably also thought they wouldn't have cameras that read your lips that are, by the way, already up all over the United States.
[00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:45.113]  By the time they tell you about them, DARPA has already been doing it for at least a decade, and any high-def digital
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.402]  When we say lip-reading cameras, it's not really the camera that's lip-reading.
[00:03:52.203 --> 00:03:56.365]  All of these systems can be fed through different biometric monitoring programs.
[00:03:57.105 --> 00:04:12.514]  They have been in place nationwide for five years at least, according to the internal documents we've seen, and have been in place in many areas for a decade, or I guess a decimation of a century.
[00:04:14.804 --> 00:04:19.607]  So we will, uh... I've already digressed there.
[00:04:19.647 --> 00:04:26.411]  It's just they have formulas and programs of how to enslave us and they follow them to great effect.
[00:04:27.952 --> 00:04:29.533]  And I just sit here in horror.
[00:04:29.593 --> 00:04:40.719]  It's like watching Carnival Barkers take somebody for a ride over and over again and you just can't get the dim-eyed public
[00:04:42.142 --> 00:04:45.166]  The dull-eyed public to even respond.
[00:04:47.448 --> 00:04:49.951]  It's like watching cows in a slaughterhouse.
[00:04:50.572 --> 00:04:55.678]  At least a cow in a slaughterhouse will flounce about a bit.
[00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.301]  No, you just go quietly.
[00:05:04.608 --> 00:05:10.055]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.436 --> 00:05:18.046]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.804]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.204 --> 00:05:37.671]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.951 --> 00:05:41.613]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:43.854]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.175 --> 00:05:48.017]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:55.621 --> 00:06:56.181]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:56.301 --> 00:06:59.522]  Or order online at murkywater.com.
[00:07:01.502 --> 00:07:03.343]  Summer is once again just around the corner.
[00:07:03.743 --> 00:07:06.023]  And as usual, so are higher gas prices.
[00:07:06.463 --> 00:07:09.624]  This year, stop taking it on the chin and start fighting back.
[00:07:10.084 --> 00:07:17.806]  Ethos FR, a product tested and found worthy by NBC and Fox News, can save you up to 19% on fuel and reduce emissions by up to 30%.
[00:07:19.086 --> 00:07:25.670]  Unlike other products and gadgets you've seen advertised, Ethos FR attacks the source of the problem, unburned fuel.
[00:07:26.111 --> 00:07:29.853]  You see, exhaust is essentially unburned fuel that's expelled from your tailpipe.
[00:07:30.313 --> 00:07:35.156]  That equates to toxins being released into the environment and dollars being released from your wallet.
[00:07:35.557 --> 00:07:42.141]  But with Ethos FR, fuel burns more completely, helping your engine to deliver better mileage and helping you to save money.
[00:07:42.761 --> 00:07:44.423]  And, it's so easy to use.
[00:07:44.823 --> 00:07:50.788]  Simply pour a couple of ounces into your tank at every fill up, and you're on your way to saving money and the environment.
[00:07:51.208 --> 00:07:57.593]  So, do yourself and the environment a favor, and visit ctsavegas.com to get your bottle today.
[00:07:57.874 --> 00:07:59.995]  That's ctsavegas.com.
[00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:07.801]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.926 --> 00:08:28.829]  In the third hour today, we have Numbers USA that actually tracks world population growth numbers
[00:08:30.049 --> 00:08:41.471]  And integrates that with the past statistics and future projections on the demographic trends in Northern and Central North America, i.e.
[00:08:41.491 --> 00:08:43.932]  the United States and Canada.
[00:08:45.752 --> 00:08:47.613]  And that's coming up in the third hour.
[00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:56.515]  At the bottom of the next hour, or even before then, I'm going to get into the start of the next hour, I'm going to get into Israel and 9-11.
[00:08:59.324 --> 00:09:07.732]  We aired this about four years ago, first time I ever saw it on the web, and somebody emailed it to me over the weekend and said, why haven't I ever heard you cover this?
[00:09:07.812 --> 00:09:15.939]  Well, been a lot of shows, a lot of broadcasts, and I guess you didn't hear the show where I did cover it, or the shows where I did cover it.
[00:09:17.441 --> 00:09:19.743]  But we'll play that Fox News piece.
[00:09:21.053 --> 00:09:22.494]  That Fox pulled.
[00:09:22.554 --> 00:09:23.574]  They never retracted it.
[00:09:23.594 --> 00:09:25.095]  They pulled all their articles about it.
[00:09:25.115 --> 00:09:26.555]  They didn't say, oh, we've retracted this.
[00:09:26.595 --> 00:09:30.517]  They just said it's disappeared into the memory hole.
[00:09:31.638 --> 00:09:43.563]  We've got several of those that we'll be playing, and they're reading some news articles, and I'll be giving you my take on the knowledge we have about 9-11, and how Israel was involved, and to what extent.
[00:09:44.223 --> 00:09:49.225]  So that is coming up in 50 minutes and 10 seconds.
[00:09:51.573 --> 00:09:53.073]  You want to be precise about it.
[00:09:55.414 --> 00:10:00.275]  But the third hour will dovetail with this first hour.
[00:10:02.255 --> 00:10:05.336]  There is a big push for taxation.
[00:10:06.216 --> 00:10:08.476]  Basically a one-child policy.
[00:10:08.516 --> 00:10:10.117]  That's exactly what China has.
[00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:16.518]  And coming up in 20 minutes, I will break that down in detail.
[00:10:19.963 --> 00:10:24.986]  You know, I'm tempted right now, I'm in a calm mood to go ahead and do it now, but you know what?
[00:10:26.307 --> 00:10:28.908]  I'm going to do it at the bottom of the hour.
[00:10:30.929 --> 00:10:43.196]  For those that just missed the last segment, major environmentalist wants world population to drop below 1 billion, same as Dr. Pianca who wants a 90% forced reduction.
[00:10:46.076 --> 00:10:49.399]  Children Bad for the Planet is the headline all over the world today.
[00:10:49.619 --> 00:10:51.861]  Hamming large families is an eco-crime.
[00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:52.601]  Times of London.
[00:10:53.762 --> 00:11:00.528]  Queen treads lightly, but don't worry, she paid a $22,000 fine to be able to travel here to the government.
[00:11:01.548 --> 00:11:11.897]  There's not a tax yet, but see, all the riches, all the owners, people that will be paid through this new global tax, they're all showing us the little monkey people down beneath them.
[00:11:11.977 --> 00:11:12.357]  Look!
[00:11:13.004 --> 00:11:15.086]  Look, I'm drilling you with the tacks.
[00:11:15.146 --> 00:11:16.086]  I'm preparing you.
[00:11:16.106 --> 00:11:18.268]  It's like a Jim Jones Kool-Aid drill.
[00:11:19.108 --> 00:11:30.616]  I remember in 1998, they would have local sponsored radio ads and come out and get your free emissions test and get $10 off your lube and tire check.
[00:11:30.636 --> 00:11:33.138]  They'll come out and get a free emissions test.
[00:11:33.198 --> 00:11:36.200]  And I walked right up to the head of the Austin Air Force.
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.322]  That was the name of the local environmental group with a federal grant.
[00:11:38.342 --> 00:11:40.403]  And I said, he said, hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:11:40.423 --> 00:11:41.384]  He just laughed right at me.
[00:11:42.225 --> 00:11:43.065]  We even have it on tape.
[00:11:43.085 --> 00:11:43.906]  Mike Hanson was there.
[00:11:46.407 --> 00:11:50.989]  That time we went out there, it was at a Texaco in South Austin.
[00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:53.950]  And I said, let me guess, this is a federal funding.
[00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.951]  I've already read them, but I just said, let me guess.
[00:11:56.531 --> 00:12:01.593]  And within the next two years, this will be a new forced level of emissions test, similar to San Francisco.
[00:12:02.333 --> 00:12:04.174]  And you're just here to acclimate the public.
[00:12:04.214 --> 00:12:05.375]  And he said, you're absolutely right.
[00:12:06.055 --> 00:12:07.295]  And it's a good thing we're doing.
[00:12:07.355 --> 00:12:08.816]  And we are training the public.
[00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:15.303]  But he said, it's for the earth, and I said, and you make a hundred grand a year, and he goes, no, I make more than that, and he started laughing.
[00:12:15.864 --> 00:12:17.685]  It's all real funny.
[00:12:19.126 --> 00:12:35.758]  It's all real funny how you train everyone like a bunch of Boston Terriers, or a bunch of Doxans, or a bunch of Jack Russells, or a bunch of Border Collies, to follow your, you know, you whistle, you snap, we cower,
[00:12:37.702 --> 00:12:42.585]  We snapped to, and I personally have had enough of it, and I just hope people get wise to this.
[00:12:43.325 --> 00:12:46.587]  I know we've had a viral effect on the group consciousness.
[00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:55.512]  By the way, when I was fumbling around before I went on air, about 60 seconds to air time, because I thought I printed it and I don't have it in front of me.
[00:12:55.532 --> 00:12:58.313]  It was the New York Post cover story today.
[00:12:58.353 --> 00:13:01.635]  It's not in my stack, so I will reprint it.
[00:13:05.296 --> 00:13:08.318]  Bruce Willis finally goes public on The Shadow Government.
[00:13:08.358 --> 00:13:12.221]  Now, I knew a lot more about Bruce Willis than I had said on air.
[00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:26.330]  I don't know, eight months ago, nine months ago, when A Scanner Darkly came out, and I had Rick Linklater on, the director of Days of the Confused, and School of Rock, and Slacker, and many other films.
[00:13:28.631 --> 00:13:34.015]  But, uh, latest, I guess Fast Food Nation and A Scanner Darkly came out right beside each other.
[00:13:35.295 --> 00:13:36.196]  But I digress.
[00:13:37.617 --> 00:13:39.458]  I've been friends with Rick since the late 90s.
[00:13:39.558 --> 00:13:40.619]  He's a listener to the show.
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.061]  But Rick is out of the blue.
[00:13:44.142 --> 00:13:48.805]  Because previously he didn't want to get into the Bruce Willis stuff that he brought up to me.
[00:13:49.125 --> 00:13:51.267]  He started getting into Bruce Willis and how they hung out.
[00:13:51.347 --> 00:13:56.551]  Bruce comes to Austin a lot and has a small apartment here, a little place he hides out at.
[00:13:57.331 --> 00:13:59.633]  It's a small apartment, one of these high-rises they built.
[00:14:01.594 --> 00:14:03.476]  And that Bruce Willis
[00:14:04.429 --> 00:14:15.697]  I've been told by three separate people, I've never talked to Bruce Willis, but I have heard from three separate Hollywood people, separately, who don't even, I guess they know each other, but they personally have talked to Bruce.
[00:14:16.738 --> 00:14:22.902]  But I don't want to put this in an article because it just sounds like I'm trying to bring attention to this broadcast, which I personally don't even care about.
[00:14:23.382 --> 00:14:25.083]  I want to just get everybody taking action.
[00:14:25.123 --> 00:14:26.344]  I want to have a chain reaction.
[00:14:26.805 --> 00:14:30.167]  I want to see us all together take over the New World Order.
[00:14:32.344 --> 00:14:36.346]  But Bruce Willis is a particular prize, you could say.
[00:14:36.366 --> 00:14:39.849]  Again, coming up, the mass extermination plans.
[00:14:39.869 --> 00:14:40.869]  I'll be covering that later.
[00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:50.855]  This is the type of thing, when people actually find out about it, it's the type of thing that will get police and military and patriots, like Bruce Willis, to come over to our side.
[00:14:52.056 --> 00:14:55.818]  You actually go read the UN saying that they intend to have public human sacrifice.
[00:14:56.759 --> 00:14:58.080]  I know that sounds insane, folks.
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.001]  I didn't put it into an international treaty.
[00:15:01.382 --> 00:15:01.882]  It's real.
[00:15:02.739 --> 00:15:03.379]  It's been the U.N.
[00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:04.419]  policy since 1976.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.201]  But see, when you actually read it on the U.N.'
[00:15:09.181 --> 00:15:17.023]  's website, when you actually hold the original documents in your hands, it has a tendency to wake you up.
[00:15:18.823 --> 00:15:19.923]  It has a tendency.
[00:15:20.483 --> 00:15:22.424]  But again, I'm digressing yet again.
[00:15:22.444 --> 00:15:24.925]  I don't have it here in front of me.
[00:15:24.965 --> 00:15:26.125]  I want to give you his exact quotes.
[00:15:26.165 --> 00:15:29.086]  Paul Watson's doing an article on it that should be up.
[00:15:29.146 --> 00:15:30.086]  In fact, I'm breaking my
[00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:46.070]  Long time rule of not having a computer in the studio, because when I do this, I tend to not focus like I'm doing right now, and then it breaks up the show.
[00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.230]  But c'est la vie.
[00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.572]  I just guess I'm like a drug addict for the Internet.
[00:15:50.692 --> 00:15:53.733]  I just I just I just can't help it anymore.
[00:15:54.113 --> 00:16:00.195]  But during the next break, I will go to PrisonPlanet.com and see if
[00:16:01.403 --> 00:16:12.710]  Paul Watson's gotten the New York Post piece and the piece he wrote about it up there integrated with the wide spectrum analysis of what Bruce Willis is up to.
[00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:24.777]  But first I heard from Rick Linklater, I don't know, probably seven, eight, nine months before he went public on the show.
[00:16:25.581 --> 00:16:32.425]  About believing 9-11 is an inside job, and that everybody he talks to believes it's an inside job, and Hollywood knows all about it being an inside job.
[00:16:33.906 --> 00:16:35.407]  He wouldn't like to be called Hollywood, though.
[00:16:35.487 --> 00:16:40.510]  Rick's from East Texas, and he's an Austinite, but he'd want to be known as a Texan.
[00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.231]  But the point is, he is Hollywood.
[00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:44.332]  He's a Hollywood, you know, hitter.
[00:16:45.553 --> 00:16:51.637]  And he was telling me about hanging out at Briz Willis, and Briz Willis seeing Marshall Laub.
[00:16:53.010 --> 00:17:14.774]  And then Bruce Willis had gotten a copy of Terror Storm, right around the time that Rick had then talked to him again, he'd sent him a copy of Terror Storm, and that Bruce Willis said, that's it, I'm totally awake, I'm no longer a Republican, this has totally changed my paradigm, now I see that they're all controlled by the same people, now I'm into it, I'm researching it,
[00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:44.297]  And then the neocons freaked out, flounced around, the hot air folks, Michelle Malkin, they couldn't get a hold of Willis, he wouldn't comment to them, and so they went to a guy, an author, who Willis had optioned to book for a movie about our brave military, because Bruce's dad was an army officer, Bruce was born in Germany, his father married a German Freulein, and
[00:17:45.109 --> 00:17:47.411]  He's a patriot, and I support the troops, too.
[00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:50.153]  I don't like what's happening to them, and I think they're brave and great.
[00:17:51.755 --> 00:17:56.118]  Except most of them now are illegal aliens, but still, I guess they've joined the team, whatever.
[00:17:59.321 --> 00:18:08.168]  And then the person that wrote the book that Bruce had optioned came out and said, I talked to Bruce, and Bruce says that what he said has been misrepresented.
[00:18:11.769 --> 00:18:16.393]  Well, that's not exactly what he said, so they went around celebrating and saying we were all liars.
[00:18:17.875 --> 00:18:18.896]  No, we're not liars.
[00:18:18.916 --> 00:18:28.705]  I then talked to two other heavyweight hitters in Hollywood who know Bruce Willis and they say, basically, Bruce Willis is a different person now.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.022]  Basically, he's totally obsessed with the New World Order.
[00:18:32.042 --> 00:18:37.805]  I ought to try to contact Bruce Willis when he's not hanging out deep-sea fishing in Turks and Caicos.
[00:18:37.905 --> 00:18:42.688]  Let me tell you, folks, if I had the money and wasn't fighting the New World Order, that's exactly what I would be doing.
[00:18:42.728 --> 00:18:43.869]  That's exactly where I'd live.
[00:18:45.089 --> 00:18:54.375]  My God, I just can't get over turquoise water and fish and the Caribbean, especially right there when it comes into the edge of the Atlantic.
[00:18:54.875 --> 00:18:55.516]  Atlantia.
[00:18:56.332 --> 00:18:56.933]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[00:18:56.973 --> 00:18:57.413]  Excuse me.
[00:18:58.093 --> 00:19:01.355]  I actually lust after the outdoors, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:03.077 --> 00:19:04.378]  I don't really lust after women.
[00:19:04.398 --> 00:19:05.078]  You know, I'm married.
[00:19:05.118 --> 00:19:05.818]  I love my wife.
[00:19:06.139 --> 00:19:06.739]  I love her.
[00:19:06.759 --> 00:19:09.221]  I don't lust after power.
[00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:10.662]  I don't lust after fame.
[00:19:10.702 --> 00:19:12.483]  I lust after being in the woods.
[00:19:13.203 --> 00:19:14.264]  And being in streams.
[00:19:14.664 --> 00:19:14.785]  Ugh.
[00:19:14.805 --> 00:19:19.308]  Alright, I really am digressing here.
[00:19:20.889 --> 00:19:22.970]  But, lust isn't the right word.
[00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:24.171]  I literally commune
[00:19:26.018 --> 00:19:30.640]  Bruce Willis believes JFK's killers are still at large and running the government.
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.281]  That's New York Post here in front of me.
[00:19:36.202 --> 00:19:38.082]  Yeah, he didn't just say it's an inside job.
[00:19:38.102 --> 00:19:39.983]  He said that they're in power right now.
[00:19:40.743 --> 00:19:43.404]  Boy, Bruce, you couldn't have said it better.
[00:19:46.585 --> 00:19:53.708]  We'll finish up with Bruce Willis, then I can get into Sarkozy, meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[00:19:53.808 --> 00:19:54.388]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.924 --> 00:20:04.966]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.607 --> 00:20:14.535]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.976 --> 00:20:22.183]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.879 --> 00:20:28.381]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:20:50.097 --> 00:20:54.259]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:20:54.279 --> 00:21:04.525]  On May 7, 2007, spot gold 690.30 and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for 712.96, 358.17 for half, and 179.09 for quarter ounce coins.

[00:21:19.933 --> 00:21:25.675]  There has been talk coming from the Council of Foreign Relations of forming an American Union combining Canada, Mexico and the U.S.
[00:21:25.775 --> 00:21:27.175]  and erasing economic borders.
[00:21:27.395 --> 00:21:34.157]  Bush met with Vincent Fox, President of Mexico, Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, discussing a security and prosperity partnership.
[00:21:34.337 --> 00:21:37.918]  The formation of a North American Union will have a great impact on the U.S.
[00:21:37.958 --> 00:21:38.458]  economy.
[00:21:38.698 --> 00:21:43.439]  Jerome R. Corsi published the document, The Plan to Replace the Dollar with the Emerald.
[00:21:43.659 --> 00:21:45.080]  The sovereignty of the U.S.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.060]  is under attack.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.906]  And Corsi uncovers the secrets and lies that surround the deceit.

[00:24:22.404 --> 00:24:23.005]  Welcome back.
[00:24:23.405 --> 00:24:25.707]  Yeah, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:26.508 --> 00:24:30.671]  I'm gonna call Paul Watson up to him and to be specific what Linklater said on and off air.
[00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:38.498]  First he gave Marshall Law on the set, then he mailed him a copy of Terror Storm and that's what woke Bruce Willis up.
[00:24:38.999 --> 00:24:41.821]  Bruce Willis says JFK killer still in power.
[00:24:42.342 --> 00:24:46.145]  Acker tells Vanity Fair he's skeptical of lone shooter theory.
[00:24:47.717 --> 00:25:07.337]  You know there was something last week I saw on Drudge Report a picture of Willis in the back of a boat fishing in Turks and Caicos and I said I need to read that article I need to click on that but I didn't and something said I need to go buy that Vanity Fair about Bruce Willis and I was even thinking to myself as I walked out of the house
[00:25:08.704 --> 00:25:10.145]  I mean, I actually said something to my wife.
[00:25:10.205 --> 00:25:11.826]  I said, man, I must be slipping.
[00:25:13.026 --> 00:25:18.369]  I want to go buy tabloid rags and read about Bruce Willis.
[00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.691]  Folks, it's always like that.
[00:25:20.711 --> 00:25:22.311]  I'm not saying I'm psychic or anything.
[00:25:22.331 --> 00:25:24.913]  They call it having the touch.
[00:25:25.976 --> 00:25:30.120]  But it's constant because I never am into tabloids.
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:34.024]  I never have a desire to go buy a magazine.
[00:25:34.064 --> 00:25:40.411]  I was like, buy that magazine or I would have known about this and been on air with this like last, I think I saw this last Thursday.
[00:25:41.311 --> 00:25:42.473]  It's just so weird.
[00:25:43.814 --> 00:25:46.697]  Bruce Willis says JFK killer still in power.
[00:25:48.047 --> 00:25:52.511]  Acker tells Vanity Fair he's skeptical of lone shooter theory.
[00:25:52.531 --> 00:26:06.463]  In a new magazine interview, Bruce Willis spills the beans on his skepticism that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of JFK and suggests that some of the same criminals who killed Kennedy are still in power today.
[00:26:08.065 --> 00:26:11.448]  Well, I don't know why we're taking the tone that Vanity Fair took.
[00:26:11.848 --> 00:26:13.690]  His actual quote is definitive.
[00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:14.911]  He's not suggesting.
[00:26:15.552 --> 00:26:18.093]  They still haven't caught the guy that killed President Kennedy.
[00:26:18.554 --> 00:26:19.394]  Period!
[00:26:19.634 --> 00:26:20.395]  In the magazine.
[00:26:20.855 --> 00:26:21.635]  Period!
[00:26:22.516 --> 00:26:24.377]  Why do we take his boldness away?
[00:26:24.837 --> 00:26:33.782]  Well, Willis told Vanity Fair's June issue, according to the New York Post, I'll get killed for saying this,
[00:26:35.706 --> 00:26:36.787]  And it goes on.
[00:26:37.187 --> 00:26:40.648]  I'll get killed for saying this, but I'm pretty sure those guys are still in power.
[00:26:41.108 --> 00:26:45.590]  In some form, the entire government of the United States was co-opted as the die-hard star.
[00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:50.892]  Watson does a great job, but it shows how they err on the side of caution.
[00:26:50.912 --> 00:26:54.834]  People think our articles sometimes are tabloid or sensationalist.
[00:26:54.894 --> 00:26:55.694]  No, it's the opposite.
[00:26:56.134 --> 00:26:58.495]  And I'm reprimanding Watson right now on air.
[00:26:59.015 --> 00:26:59.976]  This is definitive.
[00:27:03.815 --> 00:27:05.756]  Paragraph here, you don't say it's definitive.
[00:27:05.996 --> 00:27:10.299]  He has definitively come out, and he's definitively saying here.
[00:27:11.159 --> 00:27:14.981]  Now again, I commend Watson for being cautious here, but no.
[00:27:15.301 --> 00:27:16.362]  He's definitive.
[00:27:16.802 --> 00:27:17.903]  He's definitive.
[00:27:18.243 --> 00:27:20.784]  Definitive that he's saying, I could get killed for this.
[00:27:21.625 --> 00:27:23.666]  Not if more of us go public, Mr. Willis.
[00:27:25.447 --> 00:27:29.849]  By the way, I've always liked Bruce Willis, and it always disgusted me that he was brainwashed by the neocons, but there was
[00:27:30.686 --> 00:27:35.409]  You know, looks foul, acts foul, but feels fair, as they say.
[00:27:35.809 --> 00:27:48.158]  I just knew he was a good guy, and then I found out, like I said, now over a year ago that he'd woken up, I'd learned that privately, and then to have Linkletter, I don't know, eight, nine months ago, actually, time flies, maybe ten months ago, come on air and talk about it.
[00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:52.961]  I'll get killed for saying this, but I'm pretty sure those guys are still in power.
[00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:54.482]  See, first he says, I know they killed him.
[00:27:54.989 --> 00:27:58.091]  Then he says, I'm pretty sure those guys are still in power, in some form.
[00:27:58.131 --> 00:27:59.231]  Yeah, George Bush, Jr.
[00:27:59.612 --> 00:28:05.015]  was the operator, was one of the mid-level managers, and photographed at the School Book Depository Building.
[00:28:06.876 --> 00:28:11.118]  I'll get killed for saying this, but I'm pretty sure those guys are still in power, in some form.
[00:28:12.078 --> 00:28:16.101]  The entire government of the United States was co-opted, and is the die-hard star.
[00:28:16.781 --> 00:28:23.885]  So from, so from, where did a former die-hard neocon, let's not call him a neocon,
[00:28:26.144 --> 00:28:28.226]  Again, this stuff is so fast I'm going to fly.
[00:28:28.266 --> 00:28:28.906]  I'm so busy.
[00:28:28.966 --> 00:28:30.267]  I now edit stuff on air.
[00:28:31.748 --> 00:28:33.789]  He is not a neocon.
[00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:37.372]  He was someone who supported neocon policies.
[00:28:38.172 --> 00:28:39.714]  Receive a sudden wake-up call?
[00:28:40.354 --> 00:28:42.155]  There's no doubt Willis is reading the website.
[00:28:42.175 --> 00:28:43.016]  I've already been told that.
[00:28:46.638 --> 00:28:47.639]  He's really trying here.
[00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:50.221]  Let's not make him feel like we're slapping him upside the head.
[00:28:51.648 --> 00:29:03.571]  As we reported last year, Hollywood director Richard Linklater said he had handed out 9-11 truth DVDs on the set of Fast Food Nation, including Alex Jones' Terror Storm documentary, and that they had completely changed Willis' political paradigm.
[00:29:04.831 --> 00:29:11.092]  He said it put him in such a headspace that he will be quiet on issues of national policy.
[00:29:11.152 --> 00:29:14.993]  So at that point he was saying, I'm just going to disengage from the Republicans, that's what
[00:29:15.606 --> 00:29:17.707]  Linkletter said off-air.
[00:29:18.707 --> 00:29:20.628]  He told me about it previously, but I'm like, what else did he say?
[00:29:20.968 --> 00:29:22.569]  Well, he just said, let me read you the email.
[00:29:22.589 --> 00:29:23.509]  And he read me the email.
[00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:27.891]  But just basically, man, this totally changes my view of things.
[00:29:27.951 --> 00:29:29.712]  I see that both parties are controlled.
[00:29:29.772 --> 00:29:30.552]  It's a lot bigger.
[00:29:31.153 --> 00:29:33.454]  I've got to really readjust and reassess everything.
[00:29:33.734 --> 00:29:37.255]  Well, Bruce Willis did that, and less than a year later, look at what's happening.
[00:29:38.356 --> 00:29:43.978]  He said it put him in such a headspace that he will be quiet on issues of national policy, Linkletter told the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:45.083 --> 00:29:51.146]  Is Willis' comment that the people who killed Kennedy are still in power a reference to the fact that George H.W.
[00:29:51.186 --> 00:29:56.249]  Bush was photographed at the scene in Neely Plaza, or was a known CIA operative in the Bad Pigs, I would add?
[00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:58.010]  We need to have a link.
[00:29:58.931 --> 00:30:00.892]  We need to have a link to, uh...
[00:30:01.929 --> 00:30:02.770]  Attention gardeners!
[00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.191]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:30:05.431 --> 00:30:09.773]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:17.838]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:30:18.158 --> 00:30:21.000]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:28.805]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:30:28.905 --> 00:30:34.509]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:30:34.729 --> 00:30:40.292]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:30:40.573 --> 00:30:43.895]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:30:44.135 --> 00:30:47.457]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:30:47.697 --> 00:30:52.744]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Sheep Superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:30:52.764 --> 00:30:55.628]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:30:55.688 --> 00:30:55.868]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:31:02.299 --> 00:31:04.800]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:31:05.301 --> 00:31:09.543]  Did you know that the United Nations Charter outlines a path to world tyranny?
[00:31:10.123 --> 00:31:15.746]  Did you know that the United Nations is building its own army to enforce its will upon the world?
[00:31:16.346 --> 00:31:22.449]  Did you know that they've empowered themselves to cross sovereign nations' borders without consent with their armies?
[00:31:23.329 --> 00:31:33.596]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.061]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:31:36.081 --> 00:31:36.561]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:31:36.621 --> 00:31:40.082]  Just request your one-year free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:31:40.222 --> 00:31:40.682]  Call now.
[00:31:40.702 --> 00:31:43.123]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:32:03.806 --> 00:32:07.949]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:32:08.169 --> 00:32:09.931]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:32:10.191 --> 00:32:15.555]  If the resonant frequencies vibrate as big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:32:15.855 --> 00:32:21.979]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:32:22.219 --> 00:32:28.244]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[00:32:28.524 --> 00:32:30.145]  With no side effects.
[00:32:30.185 --> 00:32:34.927]  The 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[00:32:35.087 --> 00:32:38.629]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[00:32:38.929 --> 00:32:42.631]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[00:32:42.811 --> 00:32:45.352]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:32:45.492 --> 00:32:46.553]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:32:46.753 --> 00:32:49.794]  Paul Watson and Steve Watson did a fabulous job in the last few months.
[00:32:49.814 --> 00:32:51.414]  I mean they were always doing a great job.
[00:33:18.047 --> 00:33:20.507]  Just churning out great articles and analysis.
[00:33:20.527 --> 00:33:22.728]  I mean, they are literally working around the clock.
[00:33:23.248 --> 00:33:34.550]  And they're both there working right now, as well as Aaron Dykes, and Ryan Slickheisen, and Mike Nelson, and everybody else that works in this office and with this office.
[00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:47.032]  And Paul has done this blurb today about Bruce Willis going public on JFK, and saying that to those that were involved and still in power today,
[00:33:47.737 --> 00:33:48.938]  This is very important.
[00:33:48.958 --> 00:33:52.460]  We need to see a part two in more detail on this, though, because this is going to be big.
[00:33:52.941 --> 00:33:55.703]  We need you, the listeners, to push this big time.
[00:33:55.723 --> 00:33:59.125]  I'm about to get into population reduction here in just a moment.
[00:34:00.046 --> 00:34:15.497]  But it is absolutely essential that everybody go up to PrisonPlanet.com and that every other 9-11 site and every other talk show host, I mean, I have all you turkeys on here, get this story and help us promote it and push it over the edge.
[00:34:17.283 --> 00:34:28.607]  That's how we do this, because Bruce Willis is one of the last people that the fake arm of the New World Order, the fake right arm of the New World Order, had in their stable.
[00:34:29.068 --> 00:34:32.169]  He is in the top ten actors in Hollywood.
[00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.610]  He's got a bunch of big films coming out every year.
[00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:38.071]  He has been pro-war.
[00:34:38.231 --> 00:34:43.253]  He has been out there a very serious propaganda force for the globalists.
[00:34:45.051 --> 00:34:50.235]  And we told you, again, when did I have a link letter on?
[00:34:52.577 --> 00:34:54.158]  When did a scanner darkly come out?
[00:34:54.178 --> 00:34:59.803]  Oh, it came out in the fall, so five months, six, seven, eight months, yeah, eight or nine months ago.
[00:35:01.124 --> 00:35:06.948]  And that was kind of a premature way to announce it because I guess Willis hadn't gone public yet.
[00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:10.811]  But then when he got interviewed by Vanity Fair, he reportedly said this and a lot more.
[00:35:10.831 --> 00:35:11.572]  I'm going to rush out.
[00:35:12.376 --> 00:35:15.917]  And buy a copy of Vanity Fair as my instincts told me to last week.
[00:35:18.898 --> 00:35:22.439]  But certainly this is big news.
[00:35:22.639 --> 00:35:28.301]  This is big news that Bruce Willis' JFK killer is still in power.
[00:35:28.781 --> 00:35:32.982]  Acker tells Vanity Fair he is skeptical of lone shooter theory.
[00:35:34.563 --> 00:35:37.844]  This will not be a big story, as it should be, unless you go out and get it.
[00:35:38.382 --> 00:35:39.022]  Let me tell you something.
[00:35:39.082 --> 00:35:57.085]  Brainwashed neocons that can't find Iraq, don't know the difference between Shiite and Sunni, who don't know the basics of the geopolitical landscape, will hear that Bruce Willis is questioning the official 9-11 story.
[00:35:58.146 --> 00:36:04.287]  Or they'll hear he's questioning or speaking out against the JFK conspiracy theory, the government fraud.
[00:36:04.647 --> 00:36:05.967]  They'll go read this article.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.102]  And then they'll go, wait a minute, he questions 9-11?
[00:36:09.762 --> 00:36:16.687]  This article, this story, his comments in Vanity Fair could convert millions.
[00:36:16.987 --> 00:36:23.511]  I know how to see fracture points or flash points, chain reaction, domino, trigger points.
[00:36:23.791 --> 00:36:25.853]  I know how to see, I can recognize them.
[00:36:26.273 --> 00:36:33.978]  And I'm telling you right now, this is a key fracture point in their brainwashing and their conditioning, a way to reach them.
[00:36:34.947 --> 00:36:36.668]  Literally, they're like brainwashed cult members.
[00:36:37.509 --> 00:36:49.338]  And once you get a little bit ray of light into their brains, it can really open things up and blow out the cobwebs, and we can convert them to having open minds.
[00:36:49.458 --> 00:36:51.620]  And they may not even agree with us on the things we're saying.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:37:04.670]  We're individuals, but we can convert them to unlocking their own minds, their own potential to get outside the box and see the real program for what it is, and then fight the New World Order.
[00:37:06.252 --> 00:37:14.497]  Because anyone that opens their eyes is going to see the New World Order and see it as a threat and is going to instinctively launch into action against it.
[00:37:14.517 --> 00:37:15.438]  And that's what we're doing here.
[00:37:15.918 --> 00:37:18.160]  All I'm doing is literally ringing the alarm bell.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:22.062]  I'm up on top of the parapet here and I'm blowing the ram's horn.
[00:37:30.628 --> 00:37:32.129]  And I'm trying to get people
[00:37:33.167 --> 00:37:33.908]  To take action.
[00:37:34.349 --> 00:37:37.872]  I'm going, look, they say here in UN documents they plan to reduce our population.
[00:37:37.892 --> 00:37:40.915]  They're going to come out with huge taxes for people that have more than one child.
[00:37:41.175 --> 00:37:41.496]  Boom.
[00:37:41.896 --> 00:37:43.478]  It's all over Fox, CNN today.
[00:37:44.419 --> 00:37:45.500]  See, they're introducing it.
[00:37:46.491 --> 00:37:47.532]  Hey, there's federal documents.
[00:37:47.552 --> 00:37:52.755]  They're going to have a national PR campaign to put implantable chips first in prisoners, the old people, and then children.
[00:37:53.396 --> 00:37:55.837]  And boom, they're constantly announcing it every day.
[00:37:56.358 --> 00:37:58.579]  I'm only going off enemy transmissions.
[00:37:58.899 --> 00:38:00.741]  We have their operations.
[00:38:01.141 --> 00:38:05.604]  Because they have so many tens of thousands of people working for them, that they have to put it in manuals.
[00:38:06.004 --> 00:38:14.530]  And it's all put in dry language, it's all put in boring nomenclature, but the information is absolutely earth-shattering.
[00:38:17.751 --> 00:38:21.933]  Okay, I know Steve Watson is standing by for a integrated analysis.
[00:38:22.013 --> 00:38:27.376]  Again, Steve, what he does is, there's an article up on PrisonPlanet.com where he found stuff I didn't know.
[00:38:28.357 --> 00:38:37.922]  And what Steve Watson does is, what happens is, and this is about 25% of the time, I tell him articles that I think are important, angles, stories that I want them to work on.
[00:38:38.203 --> 00:38:39.383]  Classic editor behavior.
[00:38:40.524 --> 00:38:42.425]  Then I go on air and I do a brain dump
[00:38:44.141 --> 00:38:45.882]  Of just key points that I think are important.
[00:38:45.922 --> 00:38:47.423]  Steve then goes and checks them all.
[00:38:47.523 --> 00:38:48.423]  Finds the documents.
[00:38:48.804 --> 00:38:50.365]  Because again, it's like knowledge I have.
[00:38:50.425 --> 00:38:51.986]  I don't even half the time know where it came from.
[00:38:52.026 --> 00:38:53.467]  I just remember the info.
[00:38:53.507 --> 00:38:54.868]  He goes out and finds the documents.
[00:38:55.228 --> 00:38:55.948]  Finds even more.
[00:38:55.968 --> 00:38:57.369]  It's always worse than I say.
[00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:59.430]  He writes these big long articles.
[00:38:59.471 --> 00:39:04.314]  He wrote one last Friday that I didn't get a chance to plug Friday because it came out after I got off air.
[00:39:04.714 --> 00:39:07.596]  It's in the News and Focus section of PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:39:08.216 --> 00:39:08.917]  Right there on the
[00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:20.826]  Right-hand side, and it is on the EU-American Union merger that happened a week ago, now eight days ago, that's gotten almost no attention.
[00:39:20.846 --> 00:39:24.107]  The BBC did report on it, but that was about it.
[00:39:24.348 --> 00:39:27.289]  Total merger of the EU and American Union.
[00:39:27.944 --> 00:39:35.726]  And we've got the globalists bragging in there about how they're doing it, and how it's all by stealth and ha ha ha, and then links to where they are saying it.
[00:39:36.146 --> 00:39:37.787]  And so Steve just did an incredible job.
[00:39:38.207 --> 00:39:43.888]  Right now, I'm going to go over the latest population reduction announcements here.
[00:39:44.369 --> 00:39:45.869]  Let me just set the table with this.
[00:39:49.705 --> 00:40:01.312]  When you hear about a Dr. Pianca coming out now over a year ago and saying, we need an Ebola-like bio-release to reduce the world's population by over 90 percent, it needs to happen sooner rather than later.
[00:40:02.332 --> 00:40:15.239]  The story is, not that Dr. Pianca said that, but that at a speech and award ceremony with over a thousand people in attendance, and at another ceremony with over 700 in attendance, right here in Austin, at St.
[00:40:15.299 --> 00:40:16.140]  Edwards University,
[00:40:17.512 --> 00:40:21.316]  Dr. Pianka was given a standing ovation.
[00:40:21.336 --> 00:40:32.986]  We interviewed scientists and professors that were there, and they said upwards of 95% stood up with standing ovations, not at the end of the speech, but when he said we need to start killing everybody.
[00:40:34.227 --> 00:40:37.110]  When he said we need to start reducing the population forcibly.
[00:40:37.651 --> 00:40:39.012]  There was a standing ovation.
[00:40:39.132 --> 00:40:58.963]  Then, we went and found graduate papers and thesis papers written by PhDs that went through the UT scientist biosphere and climatology graduate studies, saying that he is a conservative.
[00:40:59.603 --> 00:41:02.765]  The liberals want total human extermination.
[00:41:05.627 --> 00:41:05.927]  Okay?
[00:41:08.047 --> 00:41:08.427]  All right.
[00:41:09.447 --> 00:41:13.808]  Now understand, this is the majority view being churned out.
[00:41:13.908 --> 00:41:27.210]  It is the perfect excuse to mass exterminate, to have police states, to kill human life, to lower the value of human life, which has always been dirt cheap in the elite's worldview throughout history.
[00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:32.471]  Now they're making it an almost religious thing to kill humans.
[00:41:32.831 --> 00:41:34.912]  They're making it a positive thing.
[00:41:35.272 --> 00:41:36.452]  Not just dirt cheap.
[00:41:36.512 --> 00:41:37.652]  Human life, blood is cheap.
[00:41:39.019 --> 00:41:48.527]  But this is in human psyches for some reason with throwing people into Pele, the volcano god, in Hawaii when the drought came is when they would do it.
[00:41:49.748 --> 00:41:51.549]  The earth needs blood, Gaia needs blood.
[00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:53.811]  It's the goddess worshippers.
[00:41:53.831 --> 00:42:00.737]  It didn't matter if it was in Germania or in the Peloponnesian Isles or in other areas.
[00:42:01.598 --> 00:42:03.780]  They always sacrifice people to a goddess.
[00:42:05.197 --> 00:42:06.698]  It's in human psyche.
[00:42:06.798 --> 00:42:07.379]  It's done.
[00:42:07.399 --> 00:42:19.006]  Again, if you don't even believe in religion, that's your... The point is, this is a anthropological expression that cannot be avoided or ignored.
[00:42:19.026 --> 00:42:20.247]  Alright, there's thousands of points.
[00:42:20.267 --> 00:42:21.068]  There's no way to cover them all.
[00:42:21.408 --> 00:42:21.808]  That's a problem.
[00:42:21.848 --> 00:42:22.629]  I get lost in one.
[00:42:22.669 --> 00:42:24.970]  I start going down that avenue and not covering a larger picture.
[00:42:27.752 --> 00:42:28.072]  Okay.
[00:42:29.013 --> 00:42:33.876]  And another key of Bianca's speech was that he said that the
[00:42:36.411 --> 00:42:55.987]  Chinese model is the model, and that where they have the forced abortions, they have the infanticide, they have the enforced one-child policies, and that we quote, quote, need a Chinese-style police state to enforce it.
[00:42:56.007 --> 00:42:56.968]  95% standing ovation.
[00:42:58.028 --> 00:42:59.169]  You can go back to the articles we wrote.
[00:42:59.189 --> 00:42:59.990]  I believe they said over 95%.
[00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:05.835]  They said almost everyone stood up and was like, oh yeah, oh, oh yes!
[00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:19.057]  Now, I knew about this because I went to school here locally, I know professors, I've been at media events with these people, and I mean, that's all they talk about.
[00:43:20.418 --> 00:43:24.521]  I mean, I learned when I was 20 years old that they just start talking about, what about the people bomb?
[00:43:25.682 --> 00:43:27.984]  Let's have a toast to reducing world population.
[00:43:28.324 --> 00:43:32.147]  Let's have a toast to stopping the scourge of the human people bomb.
[00:43:32.845 --> 00:43:35.726]  And I mean, that's why I'm, it's my life experience.
[00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:40.928]  Do you understand that's how I started down all these paths to discover all this, which is now being publicly announced?
[00:43:41.888 --> 00:43:43.089]  Because it's my life.
[00:43:43.209 --> 00:43:45.130]  I experienced this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:49.231]  This is, believe me, on racquetball courts, this is all they talk about.
[00:43:49.831 --> 00:43:50.652]  It's their religion.
[00:43:50.872 --> 00:43:53.633]  Like a Baptist will, you know, keeps telling you grace alone.
[00:43:54.369 --> 00:43:58.452]  And we'll ask you to go out and street preach with them.
[00:43:58.973 --> 00:44:02.115]  Just like they do that, this is what the academics do.
[00:44:02.375 --> 00:44:04.297]  And I mean folks in psychology class.
[00:44:05.037 --> 00:44:07.459]  I wasn't good at math so I was taking algebra again in college.
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:09.501]  In algebra.
[00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:12.483]  In calculus.
[00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:13.544]  That's all they taught.
[00:44:13.564 --> 00:44:20.449]  They would just stop the class and just say, and this is every week, we're going to talk about getting rid of the population.
[00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:34.037]  Along with gun control and world government, and I'm sitting there watching this, and I already read a lot of history, and so that's why I went and said, I need a radio show, I need an Axis TV show, I need to get on the air and warn people, man!
[00:44:34.277 --> 00:44:35.598]  Man, this is dangerous!
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.260]  Okay, enough about me.
[00:44:39.681 --> 00:44:42.683]  Let me just... Let me just get into this.
[00:44:47.926 --> 00:44:48.687]  There's just so much.
[00:44:49.607 --> 00:44:50.528]  Let me get into this first.
[00:44:53.152 --> 00:44:54.933]  Okay, this is the Toronto Star.
[00:44:55.693 --> 00:44:58.115]  This is Friday.
[00:44:58.875 --> 00:45:01.116]  Queen treads lightly in U.S.
[00:45:01.296 --> 00:45:05.739]  Palace planning to offset environment cost of Royal Jet Flight.
[00:45:05.979 --> 00:45:08.400]  See, this is the integrated map we're giving you.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.862]  Let me just go through individual articles and I'll tie them all together.
[00:45:13.103 --> 00:45:17.505]  Palace planning to offset environmental cost of Royal Jet Flight.
[00:45:20.097 --> 00:45:22.238]  Introducing the new Green Queen.
[00:45:22.358 --> 00:45:24.279]  See, we're all hearing, everything's green!
[00:45:24.619 --> 00:45:25.380]  Everything's green!
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.080]  Get green!
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.081]  Didn't you know it's green?
[00:45:27.101 --> 00:45:31.243]  The first green building, the first green soda, the first green car, the first green, green!
[00:45:31.503 --> 00:45:32.183]  Everything's green!
[00:45:32.243 --> 00:45:33.904]  Oh my God, it's so sexy green!
[00:45:35.805 --> 00:45:36.705]  But it's all a fad.
[00:45:36.745 --> 00:45:41.648]  They're taking all the real environmentalists and all the real environmental movements and all the people that really care.
[00:45:41.888 --> 00:45:49.792]  And there are major problems with the Earth and the entire biosphere interlocking overlay on Terra.
[00:45:54.551 --> 00:45:56.933]  And in the ocean, as well.
[00:46:01.677 --> 00:46:08.782]  They're taking up all the energies just to mindlessly get involved lobbying for world government, lobbying for world carbon tax.
[00:46:10.023 --> 00:46:10.924]  And that's what they're pushing for!
[00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:23.419]  And we've already gone over the fact that the ice caps are melting on Mars, it looks like ice is starting to precipitate out of the ground, out of the surface, and they're discovering ice, that the whole planet may suddenly be covered by water soon.
[00:46:24.179 --> 00:46:25.480]  That's not your SUV.
[00:46:25.561 --> 00:46:28.303]  That's not because you've got three beautiful children.
[00:46:28.943 --> 00:46:34.948]  It's not because your wife's pregnant and you like to have food for your children.
[00:46:38.971 --> 00:46:39.111]  No.
[00:46:41.209 --> 00:46:49.018]  It's happening because the sun is going into the brightest radiance period in the 200 years of accurate recordings.
[00:46:49.058 --> 00:46:50.660]  We've already covered that, but that needs to be in there.
[00:46:51.281 --> 00:46:59.410]  So, we've got Lance Armstrong's old girlfriend,
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.823]  Running around saying we need to have world government and world tax and the Earth's dying and the Earth's changing.
[00:47:05.243 --> 00:47:07.005]  We need to have a carbon tax.
[00:47:07.325 --> 00:47:09.686]  And we've got the SPP meeting in secret in Canada.
[00:47:10.147 --> 00:47:15.190]  And I have the documents, folks, in my hand where they say, everybody's hysterical about climate change.
[00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:17.872]  Let's tie it to a carbon tax in North America.
[00:47:22.375 --> 00:47:22.755]  And so,
[00:47:25.546 --> 00:47:33.628]  They're having the Queen, they're having the Dutch Queen, they're having everybody.
[00:47:34.348 --> 00:47:35.828]  They're having John Travolta.
[00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:45.171]  All of them are going public saying, well, I'm going to fly, but I go to these international websites that fund the UN, and every time I fly, I give them $10,000.
[00:47:45.391 --> 00:47:46.091]  Or I give them $6,000 to fly.
[00:47:53.075 --> 00:47:58.698]  No one reduces carbon emissions.
[00:47:58.758 --> 00:48:01.600]  No one reduces greenhouse emissions.
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:04.542]  No one reduces CO2 emissions.
[00:48:05.082 --> 00:48:13.847]  So they're volunteering to pay a tax that doesn't even exist yet, which they did with emissions testing all over the country.
[00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:18.350]  You understand?
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:27.106]  And of course they start with reasonable things, too, like let's get catalytic converters on those cars so you're not breathing carbon monoxide.
[00:48:28.047 --> 00:48:28.787]  I'm all for that.
[00:48:29.288 --> 00:48:30.809]  Or let's clean up factories.
[00:48:30.889 --> 00:48:31.690]  No, no, no, no.
[00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:33.632]  All that's now being reversed.
[00:48:33.672 --> 00:48:43.200]  You know factory scrubbers and factory reduction of emissions of things like mercury is being reduced and removed?
[00:48:43.861 --> 00:48:46.083]  Oh yeah, right here in Texas, all these coal-burning plants.
[00:48:46.892 --> 00:49:02.486]  I'm all for coal, if it's clean burning coal, but see they locked that up in Utah, the giant clean burning coal that's run the country for 500 plus years, and then they make us burn dirty coal, lignite, dug out of Texas, and they go dump it in these things, and mercury's in the air, at super high levels!
[00:49:02.826 --> 00:49:07.550]  What, they said like 15 plus times, last statistic I saw, of mercury?
[00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:09.712]  I mean, you know, thanks a lot!
[00:49:10.823 --> 00:49:26.785]  See, so while they've got you pushing for a global tax that's going to fund the very warmongers that own the defense complex and are funding all the big genetic engineering companies, they're doing cross-species, they've got GMO, corn that has live pesticide in it that of course is killing the bees.
[00:49:27.325 --> 00:49:28.806]  Along with a cocktail of other reasons.
[00:49:29.106 --> 00:49:30.847]  All these real things are happening.
[00:49:31.227 --> 00:49:33.888]  There are massive overfishing in many areas.
[00:49:33.908 --> 00:49:36.970]  It is bad to cut down the rainforest.
[00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:40.172]  I have done a 12 plus year analysis.
[00:49:40.312 --> 00:49:41.753]  I kept an open mind on this.
[00:49:42.073 --> 00:49:44.374]  And I can tell you there are problems with the earth.
[00:49:44.814 --> 00:49:45.174]  Okay?
[00:49:45.254 --> 00:49:48.696]  No one can debate that man is really causing some problems.
[00:49:49.296 --> 00:49:52.458]  But their solution isn't a solution at all.
[00:49:52.538 --> 00:49:56.200]  It's a global tax to be used to suppress the people.
[00:49:59.033 --> 00:49:59.974]  And here's the fad.
[00:50:02.276 --> 00:50:04.438]  Well, it says, introducing the new Green Queen.
[00:50:04.458 --> 00:50:09.462]  Well, at least say hello to a monarch aware of a very large, very real carbon footprint.
[00:50:09.882 --> 00:50:20.772]  When Queen Elizabeth II landed in Richmond, Virginia yesterday, it marked the first time that the environment cost of an official trip of Her Majesty was to be measured in offset payments made at Buckingham Palace.
[00:50:21.531 --> 00:50:31.898]  The Queen will make a payment to reforestation project or research into carbon neutral forms of energy generation or an environmental project in a developing country.
[00:50:31.958 --> 00:50:32.979]  That means she'll buy some land.
[00:50:33.399 --> 00:50:43.726]  The palace says she's going to offset her visit by 22,000 pounds or ladies and gentlemen in dollars 44,000 and change.
[00:50:48.323 --> 00:50:59.046]  But before the 81-year-old monarch is transformed into the regal Al Gore, and it goes on to say she's not doing enough, see, they're all training you to get ready for a whole new form of taxation.
[00:50:59.646 --> 00:51:09.529]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:09.889 --> 00:51:17.511]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.231 --> 00:51:25.275]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.675 --> 00:51:37.121]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.421 --> 00:51:40.883]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.344 --> 00:51:43.305]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.645 --> 00:51:47.487]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:02.637 --> 00:52:07.142]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:52:07.482 --> 00:52:11.566]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:52:11.867 --> 00:52:12.407]  We listened.
[00:52:12.727 --> 00:52:17.713]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:52:17.973 --> 00:52:18.473]  We listened.
[00:52:18.854 --> 00:52:21.877]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:52:22.317 --> 00:52:22.838]  We listened.
[00:52:23.298 --> 00:52:27.359]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:28.220]  We listened.
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:33.802]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:52:34.222 --> 00:52:35.582]  Again, we listened.
[00:52:35.942 --> 00:52:37.483]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:52:38.063 --> 00:52:40.704]  Get the Berkey Light at the American Water Purifier.
[00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:40.844]  Only $279.

[00:52:44.706 --> 00:52:45.567]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:01.898]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:02.118 --> 00:53:05.841]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:06.141 --> 00:53:15.088]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:15.248 --> 00:53:20.152]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:20.352 --> 00:53:27.397]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers as your personal information.
[00:53:27.777 --> 00:53:33.780]  Put a stop to this right now with the NET7 Network Security Switch from NET7 Technologies.

[00:53:57.236 --> 00:53:58.497]  Big John!
[00:54:00.097 --> 00:54:01.798]  Big John!
[00:54:03.299 --> 00:54:05.860]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:08.241]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[00:54:08.301 --> 00:54:11.263]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[00:54:11.483 --> 00:54:15.044]  And everybody knew you didn't give no lift to Big John.
[00:54:16.725 --> 00:54:18.946]  Big John!
[00:54:19.507 --> 00:54:21.808]  Big John!
[00:54:22.328 --> 00:54:24.029]  Big Bad John!
[00:54:25.149 --> 00:54:26.310]  Alright, we're back live.
[00:54:28.374 --> 00:54:31.035]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home.
[00:54:31.075 --> 00:54:34.857]  Bottom line, it is a massive, continual PR push.
[00:54:34.897 --> 00:54:35.937]  The biggest I've ever seen.
[00:54:37.798 --> 00:54:40.319]  On Fox News today, they were going, Democrats?
[00:54:41.299 --> 00:54:44.100]  It was like, dun-dun, nation decides.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:47.141]  Democrats want it to be global warming.
[00:54:47.341 --> 00:54:51.723]  Republicans want it to be the global war on terror.
[00:54:52.481 --> 00:55:00.744]  So they're deciding, how do you want, which fraud do you want as an organizing thread for society under your feudal lords?
[00:55:02.084 --> 00:55:03.925]  Both things are complete and total frauds.
[00:55:06.826 --> 00:55:13.949]  Just like this Nicolas Sarkozy, totally staged, wouldn't matter if the Socialists won or he won, the very same policies will continue.
[00:55:14.669 --> 00:55:19.971]  You know, the CIA and some newspapers staged those Mohammed cartoons, that's now been completely confirmed and admitted.
[00:55:20.839 --> 00:55:21.859]  They weren't even real submissions.
[00:55:21.879 --> 00:55:22.720]  They weren't even cartoons.
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:28.542]  They were black and white Xerox copies of stills off video off of Disney movies.
[00:55:29.142 --> 00:55:32.383]  And the Arabs and the Muslims bought right into it like complete fools.
[00:55:32.763 --> 00:55:34.604]  Ran around burning down half of Europe.
[00:55:34.664 --> 00:55:37.225]  And the people got conservative over there.
[00:55:37.245 --> 00:55:42.786]  And if they show your Muhammad again and you do that again, you're going to be in concentration camps, idiots.
[00:55:44.307 --> 00:55:45.127]  But we're idiots too.
[00:55:45.147 --> 00:55:46.368]  I mean, they play us like fiddles.
[00:55:48.448 --> 00:55:50.149]  They know how to punch our buttons.
[00:55:50.945 --> 00:55:55.888]  So they got the pro-New World Order Sarkozy in, because you acted like a bunch of idiots.
[00:55:57.508 --> 00:55:58.529]  Just like the illegal aliens.
[00:55:58.569 --> 00:56:04.652]  I kept telling you, they're going to have, riot police aren't going to just stand down next time, they're going to go ahead and start attacking the illegal aliens.
[00:56:05.132 --> 00:56:10.075]  And that happened, and now you see, everybody's seeing the guys in black masks as heroes.
[00:56:10.715 --> 00:56:14.057]  You know, the police chief's going after some of them, and we're slamming people's heads in the concrete.
[00:56:14.777 --> 00:56:16.278]  Now you see you're being played.
[00:56:16.298 --> 00:56:19.760]  Man, I'm going to tell you, I've got it figured out, folks.
[00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:21.751]  The problem is articulating it.
[00:56:21.951 --> 00:56:24.472]  Alright, let me shut up, because we're getting into the world government here.
[00:56:26.012 --> 00:56:33.075]  So the Queen is going to spend over 44,000 US, 22,000 pounds, because some land she'll pay for herself.
[00:56:33.596 --> 00:56:34.616]  That's environmental, of course.
[00:56:34.656 --> 00:56:38.298]  Environmental investment through approved environmental funds.
[00:56:39.358 --> 00:56:41.839]  Again, training, there's already a global tax when there isn't.
[00:56:42.479 --> 00:56:45.961]  And you can, if you're going to make a trip on plane or whatever, they all hype it up.
[00:56:46.641 --> 00:56:51.507]  How you can go buy your climate change credits on all these different websites.
[00:56:52.187 --> 00:56:53.489]  I had one of them here in front of me.
[00:56:53.529 --> 00:56:54.390]  I'll dig it out in a minute.
[00:56:55.151 --> 00:56:57.734]  Up in Canada where you can buy climate credits.
[00:56:58.395 --> 00:57:01.218]  And then that brings us into the real news here.
[00:57:01.238 --> 00:57:02.439]  The really hardcore stuff.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:06.424]  Eco-Extremists wants world population to drop to 1 billion.
[00:57:07.077 --> 00:57:09.018]  Calling the humans a disease.
[00:57:09.899 --> 00:57:10.740]  Paul Watson.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:14.942]  I noticed Paul Watson, Joseph Watson, put at the top of this.
[00:57:15.122 --> 00:57:17.424]  Obviously, the Paul Watson featured in this article.
[00:57:17.764 --> 00:57:19.625]  Paul Watson and Prison Planet are two different people.
[00:57:19.645 --> 00:57:24.689]  In addition, Alex Jones of Prison Planet is not a Harvard professor, a New York Times writer, or a football player.
[00:57:25.289 --> 00:57:26.690]  Because Paul did get the emails.
[00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:29.012]  How dare you, you traitor!
[00:57:30.012 --> 00:57:31.253]  You're really one of them.
[00:57:32.454 --> 00:57:34.055]  No, he's not the same guy.
[00:57:35.117 --> 00:57:38.942]  But, uh, apparently saving the whales is more important than saving 5.5 billion people.
[00:57:39.282 --> 00:57:51.197]  Paul Watson, founder and president of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, and famous for militant intervention to stop whalers, now warns mankind is acting like a virus and is hardening Mother Earth.
[00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:56.872]  Watson, May 4th editorial, asked the question, the beginning and the end of life as we know it on Earth.
[00:57:57.252 --> 00:58:00.793]  He left no doubt about the answer, we are killing our host, the planet Earth.
[00:58:01.313 --> 00:58:02.594]  Oh, we're a parasite now.
[00:58:03.154 --> 00:58:07.176]  He claimed and called for a population drop to less than one billion.
[00:58:07.636 --> 00:58:10.697]  And so they always act like these guys just pulled this out of a rabbit's hat.
[00:58:11.177 --> 00:58:19.661]  This is official UN policy, so we're going to dovetail it with China and this, now being introduced in the UK and the US, children bad for planet.
[00:58:20.541 --> 00:58:22.763]  Having large families is an eco-crime.
[00:58:23.404 --> 00:58:30.751]  We're gonna have a one-child policy, just like we have a North American Union, or National ID cards, just the public won't be told.
[00:58:31.732 --> 00:58:33.234]  You gotta love it.
[00:58:33.914 --> 00:58:34.735]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:37.258 --> 00:58:41.842]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:53.654 --> 00:58:54.314]  Big Brother.
[00:58:54.975 --> 00:58:56.015]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:56.736 --> 00:58:57.856]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:58.497 --> 00:58:59.317]  You want answers?
[00:59:00.078 --> 00:59:00.978]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:01.639 --> 00:59:05.481]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:05.821 --> 00:59:09.904]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.667 --> 00:59:38.064]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, as we engage the New World Order in a last-ditch effort to mobilize humanity to the fact that a small, elite, aberrant predator class is literally organizing the world along a predatory system where our numbers are to be massively culled and where the elites say that two distinct species will be engineered
[00:59:38.624 --> 00:59:38.825]  Thank you.
[00:59:55.288 --> 00:59:56.189]  Alright, let me get into this.
[00:59:56.309 --> 01:00:06.235]  For stations that just joined us, the Queen of England paid forty-something thousand dollars to fly here, you know, into a UN charity, so the Earth would be saved because of her carbon footprint.
[01:00:06.535 --> 01:00:11.859]  They're just telling you, all the scientists agree, everyone knows carbon dioxide is a deadly pollutant.
[01:00:12.099 --> 01:00:13.720]  The Earth is dying because of it.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:21.305]  They don't mention the genetic engineering or any of the real problems, or deforestation, things that really are having an effect that you could say aren't for the best.
[01:00:23.175 --> 01:00:26.919]  They totally ignore that, and they just push global government, global tax.
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:32.864]  Then they have different environmental chieftains come out and say, we need to reduce the population to below 1 billion.
[01:00:33.285 --> 01:00:34.366]  New announcements of that.
[01:00:34.866 --> 01:00:41.212]  And then, out of the Times of London, having large families is an eco-crime.
[01:00:41.232 --> 01:00:43.014]  It was actually the Sunday Times edition that did this.
[01:00:44.858 --> 01:00:47.200]  Having large families is an eco-crime.
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:51.384]  Having large families should be frowned upon as an environmental misdemeanor.
[01:00:51.424 --> 01:00:53.366]  See, it starts out a misdemeanor, a crime.
[01:00:54.567 --> 01:01:10.281]  In the same way as frequent long-haul flights, driving 4x4 cars, that doesn't take any more energy, and failing to reuse plastic bags according to a report to be published tomorrow by the Green Think Tank.
[01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:24.133]  The paper by the Optimum Population Trust, OPT, will say that if couples had two children instead of three, they could cut their family's carbon dioxide output by the equivalent of 620 return flights a year between London and New York.
[01:01:28.167 --> 01:01:36.814]  Gould Bond, I want to get this guy on, a co-chairman of OPT and emeritus professor of family planning at University of College London.
[01:01:36.835 --> 01:01:40.718]  See, these are the family planners, the ones training the CPS that grabs your kids.
[01:01:41.238 --> 01:01:44.361]  They call the family a disease and the Calhoun reader.
[01:01:46.483 --> 01:01:51.507]  He goes on, the effect of the planet, I actually have the textbook somewhere around here where they say the family is a disease.
[01:01:52.222 --> 01:01:59.666]  The effect of the planet of having one child less in order to magnitude greater than all of the other things we might do, such as switching off lights.
[01:02:00.106 --> 01:02:02.968]  An extra child is the equivalent of a lot of flights across the planet.
[01:02:03.008 --> 01:02:08.931]  So, see, they start out with getting socialized health care.
[01:02:08.971 --> 01:02:13.033]  Then they say, oh, we've all got to control how you live because we're all paying for each other.
[01:02:13.633 --> 01:02:17.455]  Then they start out by going, oh, carbon dioxide's bad, we've got to have a global tax.
[01:02:17.855 --> 01:02:21.117]  And by the way, humans are causing the problem, so we've got to have a one-child policy.
[01:02:22.856 --> 01:02:25.317]  And again, like Dr. Pianka said, China is the model.
[01:02:25.357 --> 01:02:26.818]  They get all the big UN awards.
[01:02:26.878 --> 01:02:28.059]  They plan one child.
[01:02:28.159 --> 01:02:35.462]  In fact, if you actually read what these reports say, they put out a bunch of them, they want one child or you pay a huge tax.
[01:02:35.562 --> 01:02:36.623]  It's the same thing in China.
[01:02:37.083 --> 01:02:38.884]  And if you have a third, they come by and kill it.
[01:02:39.925 --> 01:02:42.526]  Take it off for medical experiments with the child.
[01:02:43.066 --> 01:02:43.727]  Yes, they do that.
[01:02:45.267 --> 01:02:49.930]  The greatest thing anyone in Britain could do to help the future of the planet would be to have one less child.
[01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:52.391]  They go on to say that
[01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:58.814]  Europeans need to really not have children because we have a higher standard of living and use more.
[01:02:58.854 --> 01:02:59.835]  And I would count the U.S.
[01:02:59.875 --> 01:03:00.835]  as in the Western world.
[01:03:01.816 --> 01:03:12.743]  And yes, the original, that is second-wave colonists, the natives, the first aboriginal Bering Strait migrants are also migrants and colonists.
[01:03:13.264 --> 01:03:16.606]  But the second-wave colonists
[01:03:17.536 --> 01:03:34.908]  Which now would get in true indigenous status some of them 400 years to my ancestors some of which 380 years I had some on the Mayflower I actually are at a 1.5 Some areas of Europe Japan is at well, I'm gonna go into actual population numbers here.
[01:03:35.168 --> 01:03:37.950]  They call for that Let's get rid of the West.
[01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:41.093]  That's the real threat We'll be right back
[01:03:52.356 --> 01:03:57.802]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:58.183 --> 01:04:05.811]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:06.505 --> 01:04:13.570]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:25.397]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:25.697 --> 01:04:29.360]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:31.581]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:31.921 --> 01:04:35.784]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:49.281 --> 01:04:52.463]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:52.483 --> 01:04:56.525]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:04:56.665 --> 01:04:59.226]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:01.607]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:01.807 --> 01:05:10.231]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:10.311 --> 01:05:11.632]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[01:05:11.752 --> 01:05:15.794]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:15.814 --> 01:05:16.274]  We're good to go!
[01:05:36.186 --> 01:05:41.709]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.
[01:05:41.729 --> 01:05:46.412]  888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:05:46.572 --> 01:05:47.873]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:48.953 --> 01:05:51.895]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:05:52.055 --> 01:05:57.258]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:05:57.578 --> 01:06:02.861]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:06:03.301 --> 01:06:04.382]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:04.762 --> 01:06:13.570]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:15.692]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:54.549]  Big Brother.
[01:06:55.209 --> 01:06:56.250]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:56.970 --> 01:06:58.110]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:59.570]  You want answers?
[01:07:00.311 --> 01:07:01.231]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:01.251 --> 01:07:05.552]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.052 --> 01:07:10.193]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:13.254 --> 01:07:20.155]  So, bottom line, if you have more than one child, they're gonna put huge taxes on you.
[01:07:20.736 --> 01:07:21.976]  New carbon taxes.
[01:07:22.016 --> 01:07:22.496]  This is a
[01:07:23.624 --> 01:07:24.304]  Here's the crux.
[01:07:24.364 --> 01:07:26.205]  It's a neo-feudalist system.
[01:07:26.225 --> 01:07:35.348]  Because you have to understand the mindset of elites developed, whether it was in Japan or whether it was in medieval England or France.
[01:07:35.368 --> 01:07:37.268]  It didn't matter.
[01:07:37.649 --> 01:07:41.810]  They learned how to keep populations on very tiny pieces of land to control them.
[01:07:42.330 --> 01:07:48.293]  Because if you let somebody have too much land, if you let somebody get independent, they would get uppity, and they would challenge you.
[01:07:48.333 --> 01:07:49.754]  So that's the heart of this.
[01:07:49.794 --> 01:08:00.720]  And you look at the Queen of England and others, they're obsessed with horse breeding and dog breeding, and they talk about human breeding, their own breeding, and they talk about culling the human population, as Prince Philip, her husband, does.
[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:05.403]  And Queen Beatrix's father, the SS officer, Prince Bernhard,
[01:08:06.272 --> 01:08:11.614]  But the Netherlands was the founder of the World Wildlife Fund and wrote about how we needed to kill most of the population.
[01:08:12.074 --> 01:08:13.294]  No surprise, he was a Nazi.
[01:08:13.634 --> 01:08:18.836]  Hitler was huge into, quote, the environment and culling the human population.
[01:08:19.556 --> 01:08:24.377]  You see, eugenics didn't go away, as Aldous Huxley gave a speech in Berkeley in 1962 saying.
[01:08:25.157 --> 01:08:27.158]  It just changed its name.
[01:08:29.419 --> 01:08:30.539]  Now let's look at facts.
[01:08:31.781 --> 01:08:36.343]  Japan has a 1.2, and again this number is a few years old, I haven't looked at it.
[01:08:36.683 --> 01:08:38.844]  I've got some of the new numbers here in the Times of London for Europe.
[01:08:39.445 --> 01:08:39.885]  They've got a 1.2.
[01:08:42.366 --> 01:08:46.448]  Some areas of Europe have a 1.5, 1.3, the average they claim is 1.7.
[01:08:47.208 --> 01:08:50.170]  But see, that's counting immigrant influx.
[01:08:51.190 --> 01:08:52.291]  Now the United States
[01:08:53.461 --> 01:08:59.527]  Has 2.1 to 2.3, depending on the census index you look at.
[01:08:59.987 --> 01:09:07.654]  But you have to understand, we have an influx of 3 million illegal, 1 million legal aliens a year.
[01:09:08.014 --> 01:09:12.138]  Farewell populations, on average, are having 4.5 children.
[01:09:12.558 --> 01:09:13.259]  Go pull the numbers.
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:15.761]  In fact, I challenged Steve Watson in an article.
[01:09:15.781 --> 01:09:16.221]  Go pull them.
[01:09:16.241 --> 01:09:17.763]  They may have changed in the last year.
[01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:24.246]  But, but, it says the world's population is expected to increase by 2.5 billion to 9.5 billion.
[01:09:26.513 --> 01:09:26.913]  2 billion.
[01:09:26.933 --> 01:09:28.934]  It's at 6.5 billion right now.
[01:09:28.994 --> 01:09:32.736]  By 2050, almost all the population growth will take place in developing countries.
[01:09:33.036 --> 01:09:38.558]  The population of developed nations is expected to remain unchanged and would have declined but for migration.
[01:09:38.918 --> 01:09:39.598]  Migration.
[01:09:39.618 --> 01:09:43.220]  They don't call it usurpation or being usurped or overrun.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.720]  The death of the West.
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.421]  I have to admit, I'm a little sad about it.
[01:09:47.181 --> 01:09:48.582]  The British fertility rate is 1.7.
[01:09:48.682 --> 01:09:49.102]  The EU average is 1.5.
[01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:59.374]  In some countries, such as France, the government is so concerned it has introduced financial incentives for women to have more than two children.
[01:10:00.245 --> 01:10:11.116]  Despite this, the population study group says rich countries should be the most concerned about family size as their children have the higher per capita carbon dioxide emission.
[01:10:11.557 --> 01:10:16.181]  Oh, God forbid more CO2 be put out, that the trees just relish.
[01:10:16.762 --> 01:10:18.123]  That's their oxygen.
[01:10:18.324 --> 01:10:22.348]  Then they spew out luscious, clean... That's why when you're in a forest, it just...
[01:10:23.268 --> 01:10:31.992]  He's just breathing a higher level of oxygen before it's been fully precipitated and mixed with the other dominant gases in the atmosphere.
[01:10:32.493 --> 01:10:41.717]  Oxygen and carbon dioxide are actually minority gases in the entire gaseous sphere surrounding the planetoid we live on.
[01:10:42.914 --> 01:10:50.379]  God forbid we have that forest, that wonderful oxygen infusion.
[01:10:50.539 --> 01:10:52.140]  Oh, it's such a pollutant.
[01:10:52.301 --> 01:10:52.941]  Oh, help me.
[01:10:53.962 --> 01:10:56.924]  The suggestion has been criticized by family rights campaigners.
[01:10:57.644 --> 01:11:03.108]  Ellen McCoy, a geography graduate from Glasgow with 10 children said, how dare they suggest how many children we should have.
[01:11:03.737 --> 01:11:11.102]  Well, all over England, we can pull the articles where they CPS people who are upstanding citizens, who have more than four children.
[01:11:11.122 --> 01:11:13.904]  In fact, I saw one of those on Prison Planet a few weeks ago, Steve.
[01:11:14.284 --> 01:11:15.245]  Get that and put it in there.
[01:11:15.785 --> 01:11:19.327]  And again, they teach them in these things that people who have a bunch of kids are like cult members.
[01:11:20.828 --> 01:11:24.030]  My God, I wish I had the time, energy, and money to have ten kids.
[01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:25.211]  My wife would love to have ten.
[01:11:25.712 --> 01:11:28.433]  We just can't do it because we've committed to fight the New World Order.
[01:11:28.473 --> 01:11:30.855]  But believe me, it is a luxury.
[01:11:31.582 --> 01:11:31.923]  And it is.
[01:11:32.143 --> 01:11:34.846]  They tell you and they demonize children and tell you how horrible it is.
[01:11:35.326 --> 01:11:37.408]  You don't truly activate as a human being.
[01:11:37.468 --> 01:11:39.871]  Your instincts don't fully activate and you don't...
[01:11:40.635 --> 01:11:42.636]  I literally became so much stronger when I had children.
[01:11:42.656 --> 01:11:44.536]  I got more energy immediately.
[01:11:44.857 --> 01:11:46.197]  I got smarter immediately.
[01:11:46.557 --> 01:11:47.557]  It's like a brain boost.
[01:11:47.718 --> 01:11:57.081]  Whole areas of your physiology in your central nervous system literally activate when you have children and the level of love you have.
[01:11:57.441 --> 01:12:01.542]  You'll never experience love with your husband or wife like you have with your children.
[01:12:04.435 --> 01:12:11.880]  It's like the few religious experiences that were truly high-powered, you know, communing with God experiences, the really strong ones.
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:19.444]  It's as strong, because I believe you're almost communing with God, you know, with your children.
[01:12:19.524 --> 01:12:23.867]  It's that family interaction that's truly at the base of the human
[01:12:25.059 --> 01:12:26.240]  Uh... soul.
[01:12:26.421 --> 01:12:29.603]  You know, the very essence of humanity is the tribe.
[01:12:30.204 --> 01:12:34.627]  And of course the enemy seeks to rend that because they know that you owe total allegiance.
[01:12:35.008 --> 01:12:38.591]  They also want to... Oh, by the way, this is key.
[01:12:40.225 --> 01:12:40.966]  They're going to hurt us.
[01:12:41.006 --> 01:12:41.967]  They're going to tax us.
[01:12:41.987 --> 01:12:42.788]  They're going to regulate us.
[01:12:42.808 --> 01:12:44.070]  They're going to put us in compact cities.
[01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.731]  They've said all that.
[01:12:44.851 --> 01:12:45.752]  One child policy.
[01:12:45.792 --> 01:12:47.054]  CPS grabbing the children.
[01:12:47.495 --> 01:12:48.536]  Breaking down the family.
[01:12:48.596 --> 01:12:50.619]  Having the kids stay at school until 7, 8 at night.
[01:12:50.939 --> 01:12:52.221]  Getting rid of summer vacation.
[01:12:52.261 --> 01:12:53.603]  Cutting it down to two to three weeks.
[01:12:53.963 --> 01:12:54.884]  That's all happening.
[01:12:55.625 --> 01:12:57.488]  Drugging of the population to get control.
[01:12:59.969 --> 01:13:04.292]  But the other big key here is, is you already hear, oh, the first cancer-free baby to be born.
[01:13:04.893 --> 01:13:07.215]  Oh, the first, oh, they're looking at genes for anger.
[01:13:07.235 --> 01:13:09.156]  Oh, they're looking for genes at crime.
[01:13:09.676 --> 01:13:19.144]  Oh, in Oregon and in the United Kingdom, they're going to look at people who have criminal records and decide if they're allowed to have children.
[01:13:19.404 --> 01:13:20.324]  Could it be genetic?
[01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:23.747]  CPS will visit with the mother because she has a criminal record.
[01:13:23.787 --> 01:13:24.728]  Could it be genetic?
[01:13:24.768 --> 01:13:25.548]  It's all eugenics.
[01:13:25.869 --> 01:13:27.370]  Oh, we're not going to let you have a child.
[01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:28.931]  Why, there's socialized
[01:13:28.951 --> 01:13:29.751]  Socialized medicine?
[01:13:29.931 --> 01:13:31.972]  That's why we have to have socialized medicine for everyone?
[01:13:32.332 --> 01:13:34.773]  Oh, well, we shouldn't have to pay for your bad genes.
[01:13:37.193 --> 01:13:50.558]  But what they know is when you change one gene, you can get control of that one expression or that one trait, but then it randomly changes like a wheel of fortune thousands of other variables in chain reactions.
[01:13:51.198 --> 01:13:58.460]  You watch, these people that have these babies, these people that have had their genes altered, you watch, they're going to be mentally ill.
[01:13:59.255 --> 01:14:02.736]  Or they're going to have horrible health problems that just accelerate out of nowhere.
[01:14:02.976 --> 01:14:05.217]  But that will all be kept real quiet in the press.
[01:14:05.477 --> 01:14:12.660]  It's like the Ritalin and the Prozac causes all these suicides and killings and horrible behavior and heart palpitations and strokes.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.461]  Oh, that doesn't matter to them!
[01:14:15.361 --> 01:14:17.642]  Because then they just go, oh look at all the suicides!
[01:14:18.002 --> 01:14:18.762]  All the violence!
[01:14:18.782 --> 01:14:23.804]  We've got to put more psychiatrists and psychologists in the schools and force drug half the kids instead of 15%.
[01:14:23.924 --> 01:14:24.104]  See?
[01:14:27.668 --> 01:14:42.716]  And they've also found, for some reason, that people who have certain genetic malfunctions, quote, then they'll have other, and it's been found, I mean there's major studies on this, will have extreme other traits of intelligence or musical talent.
[01:14:42.936 --> 01:14:46.798]  You see, you don't know what these genetics, you don't know why that happened.
[01:14:47.199 --> 01:14:51.261]  It happened for a reason, ladies and gentlemen, in our unbelievable design.
[01:14:51.882 --> 01:14:57.838]  And again, I believe in God, but even if you don't believe in God, in the development of the species, in the craftsmanship...
[01:14:59.955 --> 01:15:05.216]  Because you've got a bunch of mad scientists just doing whatever they want with it and now maybe we should make people.
[01:15:05.536 --> 01:15:05.916]  Why?
[01:15:05.936 --> 01:15:07.137]  We've got socialized health care.
[01:15:07.177 --> 01:15:13.758]  Why shouldn't we go in and screen the embryos for the baby that won't have breast cancer?
[01:15:14.399 --> 01:15:27.402]  Now let's not stop dioxin in the water and dioxin in the plastics and all the heavy metals and our daughters drinking all of these milk and cheese products filled with growth hormone so when they're 8 years old they look like they're 16.
[01:15:28.763 --> 01:15:31.464]  Your son is effeminate because of all the female hormones.
[01:15:31.724 --> 01:15:33.685]  Your daughter is hyper-female.
[01:15:36.706 --> 01:15:39.988]  Let's not change that so the breast cancer rate doesn't explode.
[01:15:40.228 --> 01:15:42.449]  It's up several thousand percent in the last 60 years.
[01:15:42.929 --> 01:15:45.390]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:48.872]  Even with smoking going down, lung cancer went up, what was it?
[01:15:49.392 --> 01:15:51.633]  Seven times what it was in the decade previous.
[01:15:51.913 --> 01:15:52.873]  Those numbers just came out.
[01:15:53.053 --> 01:15:53.814]  People who never smoked.
[01:15:53.834 --> 01:15:56.575]  But what do you think with coal-burning plants with mercury?
[01:15:57.135 --> 01:15:58.656]  Oh, but we're not going to stop that!
[01:15:59.116 --> 01:15:59.616]  No!
[01:15:59.976 --> 01:16:00.456]  No!
[01:16:00.657 --> 01:16:01.097]  No!
[01:16:01.277 --> 01:16:01.637]  No!
[01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:07.539]  We're going to have a global tax on carbon dioxide that's paid into the world government.
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:21.985]  So, this is how they're getting control of us, and you're going to have the one-shot policy, as it says here, as the UN and others are proposing, an eco-crime, a misdemeanor.
[01:16:22.794 --> 01:16:25.015]  And of course it'll go from being a misdemeanor like hate crimes.
[01:16:25.195 --> 01:16:32.076]  They have police all over England, from Northern England and Scotland down to Wales and then down to the coast.
[01:16:32.796 --> 01:16:36.337]  This has been all over their news, BBC headlines, hundreds arrested in hate raids.
[01:16:36.377 --> 01:16:37.338]  You read what they're arrested for?
[01:16:37.898 --> 01:16:41.098]  Many were heard saying racist comments under their breath at dinner.
[01:16:41.559 --> 01:16:42.919]  Yes, they have police sitting there.
[01:16:43.159 --> 01:16:46.800]  First it was a misdemeanor, now they're making it a serious charge.
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:49.400]  Now they're phasing out juries there and here.
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:49.480]  See?
[01:16:49.921 --> 01:16:50.041]  See?
[01:16:52.216 --> 01:16:53.357]  It's the same thing with this!
[01:16:55.499 --> 01:16:57.542]  Being penalized for children!
[01:17:03.208 --> 01:17:08.053]  Now, don't think the elites are just saying we need to get rid of the West, and they are doing that quite nicely.
[01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:13.779]  They are also busily engaging in bio-race-specific warfare
[01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:40.221]  That has come out in a bunch of publications as of late, race-specific bio-warfare, and it's come out that Israel's been designing it, South Africa was designing it, the PNAC boys had proposed it, and they've, the 1973 Henry Kissinger CIA population reduction plan, the Club of Rome plan, ordering the third world, if you want IMF and World Bank money, you've got to forcibly sterilize half your women, and brother, they did it!
[01:17:42.262 --> 01:17:43.102]  So I hope now,
[01:17:44.853 --> 01:18:08.613]  You're beginning to realize the magnitude of this, and then on top of it, the people running all of this, they tell you to be atheistic, they tell you not to have a religious soul, but then they are completely going to retreats, and are obsessed with Gaia, and the goddess Eulogia, and Diana, it's all the same entity, according to them, and here it is!
[01:18:11.235 --> 01:18:11.656]  Where is it?
[01:18:13.739 --> 01:18:19.546]  Gore sees spiritual crisis in warming, playing equal parts visionary, cheerleader, and comedian.
[01:18:19.646 --> 01:18:26.134]  Al Gore brought his message of how to fight global warming to a capacity crowd of receptive architects Saturday in San Antonio.
[01:18:26.154 --> 01:18:29.458]  The former vice president referred continually to the new way of thinking.
[01:18:29.498 --> 01:18:31.040]  See, they're trying to have a paradigm shift.
[01:18:31.461 --> 01:18:32.462]  We've got to have the shift.
[01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:39.278]  That is emerging in a country that offered hope in the battle to control the effects of global warming and the way on the planet.
[01:18:39.658 --> 01:18:41.581]  He said it is a spiritual crisis.
[01:18:41.641 --> 01:18:43.884]  It's a crisis of our own self-definition.
[01:18:43.904 --> 01:18:45.707]  He wanted to say it's a new religion.
[01:18:45.727 --> 01:18:48.651]  And you're absolutely right it is, you devil worshiper.
[01:18:49.338 --> 01:18:54.420]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:19:01.803]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:19:01.943 --> 01:19:12.567]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:19:12.767 --> 01:19:17.309]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:19:17.609 --> 01:19:22.592]  Unbelievably, they even remove small microparticulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:19:22.812 --> 01:19:25.734]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:25.974 --> 01:19:35.640]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:19:50.777 --> 01:19:52.619]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:19:52.699 --> 01:19:56.484]  On May 7, 2007, spot gold 690.30 and 1 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $712.96, $358.17 for half, and $179.09 for quarter ounce coins.

[01:20:07.336 --> 01:20:13.078]  There has been talk coming from the Council of Foreign Relations of forming an American Union combining Canada, Mexico and the U.S.
[01:20:13.198 --> 01:20:14.579]  and erasing economic borders.
[01:20:14.799 --> 01:20:21.541]  Bush met with Vincent Fox, President of Mexico, Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, discussing a security and prosperity partnership.
[01:20:21.762 --> 01:20:25.323]  The formation of the North American Union will have a great impact on the U.S.
[01:20:25.363 --> 01:20:25.863]  economy.
[01:20:26.123 --> 01:20:30.845]  Jerome R. Corsi published the document, The Plan to Replace the Dollar with the Emerald.
[01:20:31.085 --> 01:20:32.506]  The sovereignty of the U.S.
[01:20:32.766 --> 01:20:33.466]  is under attack.
[01:20:33.926 --> 01:20:37.307]  And of course he uncovers the secrets and lies that surround the deceit.

[01:20:49.071 --> 01:20:54.015]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:20:54.315 --> 01:20:56.196]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[01:20:56.397 --> 01:20:59.439]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:20:59.619 --> 01:21:02.761]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:21:03.062 --> 01:21:04.923]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:21:05.183 --> 01:21:08.885]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[01:21:09.165 --> 01:21:11.826]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[01:21:12.447 --> 01:21:16.749]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[01:21:16.949 --> 01:21:21.191]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[01:21:21.631 --> 01:21:25.974]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.

[01:21:55.290 --> 01:21:57.611]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[01:21:57.891 --> 01:22:01.152]  That's why you need SFR's Protect-A Synthetic Oil Treatments.
[01:22:01.372 --> 01:22:06.134]  Protect-A Engine Treatment, Protect-A Transmission Treatment, and Protect-A Complete Fuel System Treatment.
[01:22:06.394 --> 01:22:14.137]  Protekta meets the demands you put on your vehicle by providing more horsepower, improving gas mileage, decreasing emissions, and promotes longer engine life.
[01:22:14.438 --> 01:22:21.321]  Only Protekta contains a new technology, Nano-B, which is not found in any competitive additive products at your local auto parts store.
[01:22:21.601 --> 01:22:23.842]  At Protekta, we do not compromise quality.
[01:22:24.002 --> 01:22:28.744]  Because you expect the very best, we provide products that work right the first time, every time.
[01:22:29.004 --> 01:22:31.365]  So get more when you treat it right with Protekta.
[01:22:31.625 --> 01:22:32.066]  We're good to go.
[01:22:53.276 --> 01:22:56.357]  I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[01:22:56.397 --> 01:23:00.099]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[01:23:00.979 --> 01:23:05.501]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[01:23:05.881 --> 01:23:14.065]  And when you're out there, without care, yeah, I was out of touch.
[01:23:14.625 --> 01:23:19.427]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough.
[01:23:19.907 --> 01:23:21.428]  I just knew too much.
[01:23:22.623 --> 01:23:30.965]  To watch my fellow Americans and my fellow humans willfully going along with their own destruction or enslavement is sad.
[01:23:31.485 --> 01:23:34.506]  I'm talking to the military, the police, the bureaucrats, the social workers.
[01:23:35.446 --> 01:23:36.226]  We got the facts.
[01:23:36.246 --> 01:23:37.346]  We know who you're working for.
[01:23:37.506 --> 01:23:45.168]  And denying it doesn't change that what you're doing is going to hurt your children and your family and your future just as much as it's going to hurt me.
[01:23:46.588 --> 01:23:51.009]  Okay, finishing up with this important subject, we're going to play a newscast about it coming up.
[01:23:53.047 --> 01:23:59.414]  This is a San Antonio Express News about Al Gore saying it's a spiritual crisis and needs spiritual answers to save the Earth.
[01:23:59.434 --> 01:24:01.296]  Because it is a spiritual belief.
[01:24:01.376 --> 01:24:02.617]  It's a religious belief.
[01:24:03.658 --> 01:24:11.907]  Global warming, now this is the so-called conservative San Antonio Express News telling you global warming is an absolute fact and that it's man-made.
[01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.449]  You see?
[01:24:14.429 --> 01:24:21.511]  Global warming is the heating of the Earth caused in large part by man-made emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
[01:24:22.071 --> 01:24:35.974]  Most scientists agree such warming and the changing climate that comes with it will likely cause a number of problems and crises this century, particularly in developing countries that have few resources to combat the effects.
[01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:40.688]  So we need a global tax to go help them with special shots.
[01:24:42.089 --> 01:24:46.633]  And special leaders and militaries the globalists put in to help them.
[01:24:46.793 --> 01:24:48.555]  Oh, they help them too, let me tell you.
[01:24:51.639 --> 01:24:54.001]  But they just say most scientists agree.
[01:24:54.041 --> 01:25:00.745]  No, the top climatologists, the top scientists are all over the place going, my name's been put on that list for 2000, I never even talked to them!
[01:25:01.265 --> 01:25:01.565]  What?
[01:25:01.825 --> 01:25:03.006]  That's a complete fraud!
[01:25:03.306 --> 01:25:20.897]  All the ice core samples and all the experts are reporting that and all of the sun measurements show that the sun is causing some global warming and that carbon dioxide follows 200 to 800 years after a spike in temperature due to flora and fauna increase
[01:25:21.899 --> 01:25:26.250]  In the upload of the photosynthesis, and it just goes on and on.
[01:25:27.574 --> 01:25:29.800]  With all of the scientific datum.
[01:25:33.491 --> 01:25:43.136]  And you try to tell this to the general public, well I read in San Antonio, it's fresh news, the earth is heating up, and we gotta have a global tax to save us.
[01:25:43.176 --> 01:25:46.018]  Now in most articles, they haven't gotten to the solution phase.
[01:25:46.038 --> 01:25:54.702]  Right now they're going, problem, problem, problem, but in academia and in actual UN documents and now in some news articles they go, the solution is a global carbon tax.
[01:25:55.342 --> 01:26:00.005]  The general public is still sending me emails going, there's no plan for no carbon tax.
[01:26:00.797 --> 01:26:03.240]  There's no North American Union.
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.602]  There's no EU.
[01:26:05.062 --> 01:26:09.387]  There's no... There ain't no foreign troops in our military.
[01:26:09.687 --> 01:26:11.329]  George Bush is a conservative.
[01:26:11.369 --> 01:26:12.711]  He ain't anti-gun!
[01:26:14.913 --> 01:26:17.016]  You're some kind of commie!
[01:26:18.203 --> 01:26:21.565]  No, I'm just somebody that found out about some really bad stuff, but trying to warn you.
[01:26:21.965 --> 01:26:26.248]  And frankly, I want to slap you upside the head, because I know you mean well, just like Bruce Willis.
[01:26:26.809 --> 01:26:31.592]  And you may never wake up like Bruce Willis did to 9-11 and JFK, and he's now gone public.
[01:26:32.072 --> 01:26:34.433]  For those that didn't know, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:26:35.014 --> 01:26:38.216]  You may never wake up, and I'm sad for you.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.380]  Okay?
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:45.663]  I literally go to bed every night and I think about how much danger we're all in, how serious this is.
[01:26:45.683 --> 01:26:47.123]  I think about myself.
[01:26:47.223 --> 01:26:48.764]  What have I gotten myself into?
[01:26:49.104 --> 01:26:53.946]  And I just recommit and I say it's for the best and it's the right course to take against these evil people.
[01:26:54.426 --> 01:26:55.626]  I'm living in the real world.
[01:26:55.926 --> 01:26:59.928]  I try to put a good face on it and be a little bit jovial and be aggressive on air.
[01:27:00.608 --> 01:27:02.789]  But frankly, that's just me gutting up to do it, folks.
[01:27:05.402 --> 01:27:06.382]  I'm getting chills right now.
[01:27:06.443 --> 01:27:21.829]  I cannot believe that we're on this beautiful planet, orbiting the sun, out here in the universe, and that our own species is ruling over us, setting up neo-feudalism and world serfdom on a global plantation, and that we're just totally enslaved.
[01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:26.371]  Well, it's coming towards total enslavement.
[01:27:26.392 --> 01:27:27.752]  They're setting up total enslavement.
[01:27:28.793 --> 01:27:34.055]  And the general public is so wedded, the fake left, the fake right, all of you guys, that you just can't get out of it.
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:36.621]  And I'm on a mission.
[01:27:36.641 --> 01:27:44.386]  You know, I get mad at our own movement when there's infighting and idiocy and people throwing stones and, you know, I even get sucked into it sometimes.
[01:27:44.446 --> 01:27:49.890]  Folks, we've got to recommit and all hang together or hang separate, as the Founding Fathers said.
[01:27:50.391 --> 01:27:52.292]  I mean, this is the time that tries men's souls.
[01:27:52.332 --> 01:27:52.912]  This is it.
[01:27:52.932 --> 01:27:56.395]  Do you realize the time we are alive right now?
[01:27:56.795 --> 01:27:59.417]  This is the critical juncture in our species development.
[01:28:00.268 --> 01:28:03.170]  And I know that I'm hitting on all eight cylinders, folks.
[01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:04.451]  My elevator goes all the way to the top.
[01:28:04.791 --> 01:28:05.972]  I'm blessed to have clarity.
[01:28:06.732 --> 01:28:09.554]  And, you know, some form of clarity compared to the general public.
[01:28:10.014 --> 01:28:12.515]  And I see what's going on clearer than day.
[01:28:14.056 --> 01:28:17.278]  And it is, it's just hard to describe it.
[01:28:17.358 --> 01:28:24.603]  Like I've said many times, it's like somebody says, you know, you call family when you're in the Rocky Mountains on some Vista looking down on an icy blue lake.
[01:28:25.612 --> 01:28:26.753]  Ah, it's beautiful up here.
[01:28:26.773 --> 01:28:27.493]  It's so beautiful.
[01:28:27.853 --> 01:28:28.714]  Oh, what's it look like?
[01:28:29.014 --> 01:28:32.916]  Ah, it's just the mountains, the, you know, the lake, the forest.
[01:28:33.576 --> 01:28:34.516]  Oh, I see an elk.
[01:28:34.836 --> 01:28:38.598]  But you can't... One cannot... One must see the Matrix.
[01:28:38.778 --> 01:28:39.479]  One cannot be told.
[01:28:39.519 --> 01:28:40.399]  We're on the march.
[01:28:40.859 --> 01:28:42.480]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:43.381 --> 01:28:46.062]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:53.862 --> 01:29:54.643]  You heard that right.
[01:29:54.724 --> 01:29:57.026]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[01:29:57.227 --> 01:29:58.468]  You don't have to pay them off.
[01:29:58.628 --> 01:30:00.150]  The banks are defrauding you.
[01:30:00.311 --> 01:30:01.772]  Now is the time to fight back.

[01:30:49.535 --> 01:30:50.376]  Attention gardeners!
[01:30:50.436 --> 01:30:52.799]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:30:53.039 --> 01:30:57.384]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[01:30:57.584 --> 01:31:05.452]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:31:05.772 --> 01:31:08.594]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:31:08.895 --> 01:31:16.421]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:31:16.521 --> 01:31:22.125]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:31:22.346 --> 01:31:27.910]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:31:28.190 --> 01:31:31.433]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:31:31.733 --> 01:31:35.076]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:31:35.317 --> 01:31:40.361]  GCN listeners who want to grow DERP sheep superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:31:40.381 --> 01:31:43.244]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:31:43.304 --> 01:31:43.484]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:12.172 --> 01:32:18.714]  Marty, Matthew, Roy, Andrew, Tyler, everybody, we're going to get to your calls.
[01:32:20.494 --> 01:32:29.396]  We'll get into real demographic numbers and the real world population statistics on the other side with Numbers USA on the other side of this hour.
[01:32:30.825 --> 01:32:35.509]  We'll have open phones then as well for you.
[01:32:37.811 --> 01:32:58.668]  Briefly here at the waypoint, the halfway point of this worldwide transmission against tyranny, nobody else, and I wish there were other people that got the big spectrum, that we have social engineers suppressing a lot of advanced technologies and life extension for themselves, that we have an elite on a complete power trip setting up a high-tech form of feudalism,
[01:32:59.648 --> 01:33:04.832]  Nobody else is really boiling it down like we are here and I would like to expand our operations.
[01:33:04.852 --> 01:33:06.233]  We are expanding our operations.
[01:33:06.273 --> 01:33:07.654]  I would like to become more effective.
[01:33:08.154 --> 01:33:11.196]  I would like to put up more sophisticated, newer websites.
[01:33:11.897 --> 01:33:18.001]  I would like to be able to get out more articles and more analysis and expand what we're doing.
[01:33:20.323 --> 01:33:22.785]  And the way we can do that is if you support us.
[01:33:22.865 --> 01:33:24.646]  So please go to InfoWars.com.
[01:33:27.413 --> 01:33:30.934]  And when you support us, you also get powerful films at very low prices.
[01:33:30.954 --> 01:33:34.836]  You can get my new film, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, for as low as $9.95.
[01:33:36.116 --> 01:33:37.977]  You can get America, Freedom to Fascism, as low as $9.95.
[01:33:38.657 --> 01:33:40.838]  There is part of some of the package specials.
[01:33:41.758 --> 01:33:46.060]  You can get 9-11, Inside Job, black baseball caps at cinfowars.com.
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:47.780]  Great way to meet like-minded people, by the way.
[01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:51.261]  For as low as, I think, $5.95, you get a couple of them.
[01:33:52.082 --> 01:33:53.842]  We've got t-shirts for $9.95, 9-11, Inside Job t-shirts.
[01:33:56.352 --> 01:33:59.093]  We've got Mind Control by Dr. Nick Begich.
[01:33:59.913 --> 01:34:06.655]  We've got our Rack for Sale, The War at Profiteers, Riddles in Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C.
[01:34:07.116 --> 01:34:09.596]  We have David Ray Griffin who's joining us on Thursday.
[01:34:10.377 --> 01:34:18.159]  A new book, Debunking the 9-11 Debunkers, available with a documentary film about David Ray Griffin and his work and his analysis.
[01:34:18.459 --> 01:34:20.380]  You can get it with the book at a big discount.
[01:34:21.727 --> 01:34:24.889]  So that's a featured item up there on InfoWars.com.
[01:34:24.909 --> 01:34:27.570]  9-11 Press for Truth, they lied, they all lied.
[01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:36.854]  The cover-up exposed by the 9-11 families, 9-11 aftermath from Guerrilla News Network, and so many other great books and films and materials.
[01:34:39.035 --> 01:34:42.597]  And I'm so focused on covering the news that it is a catch-22.
[01:34:42.977 --> 01:34:50.781]  It's a conundrum, or a paradox, because I want to just cover news and take calls and have guests on, and then I do that so much that I used to plug videos every hour.
[01:34:51.545 --> 01:34:52.546]  And I sold more videos.
[01:34:52.566 --> 01:34:54.228]  But now I can't control myself.
[01:34:54.308 --> 01:34:55.048]  I don't even do it.
[01:34:55.809 --> 01:34:57.551]  Because I've got so much I want to cover.
[01:34:57.571 --> 01:34:59.492]  I haven't even scratched the surface of the stack yet.
[01:35:00.253 --> 01:35:06.318]  But this Central World Feudalism Population Extermination Program is so key, I did an hour and a half without even taking calls.
[01:35:06.799 --> 01:35:08.841]  Without even plugging videos.
[01:35:09.739 --> 01:35:12.460]  But the point is, it's not just, hey, come support us, get the videos.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:13.441]  These are great films.
[01:35:13.761 --> 01:35:14.821]  They deserve to be seen.
[01:35:14.861 --> 01:35:15.662]  They need to be seen.
[01:35:15.722 --> 01:35:16.982]  Get Terror Storm, make copies.
[01:35:17.322 --> 01:35:19.103]  Get America Freedom from Fascism, make copies.
[01:35:19.123 --> 01:35:21.104]  Loose Change, 2nd edition, make copies.
[01:35:21.404 --> 01:35:23.265]  Have the high quality digital originals.
[01:35:23.525 --> 01:35:30.989]  Support the filmmakers, like Dylan Avery, and Cory Rowe, and Jason Bermanson, myself, Alex Jones, and Aaron Russo, and others.
[01:35:32.209 --> 01:35:33.670]  Make no mistake, we're having an effect.
[01:35:33.730 --> 01:35:33.910]  I mean,
[01:35:34.739 --> 01:35:49.351]  Rick Linklater told you here on air, the Hollywood director, that last year he woke up Bruce Willis to the New World Order in the 9-11 and now Bruce Willis is in Vanity Fair saying the government killed Kennedy and it's a big cover-up and they're still in control right now and over through America.
[01:35:49.672 --> 01:35:52.634]  Bruce Willis is totally woken up.
[01:35:53.315 --> 01:35:54.756]  Now, will he get a bunch of heat?
[01:35:54.796 --> 01:35:55.517]  What's going to happen?
[01:35:56.077 --> 01:35:57.698]  He said, they're probably going to kill me for this.
[01:35:58.019 --> 01:35:59.740]  That's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:01.542]  Take his courage and run with it.
[01:36:01.942 --> 01:36:02.382]  Spread it.
[01:36:02.462 --> 01:36:03.123]  It's infectious.
[01:36:03.644 --> 01:36:04.405]  It's infectious!
[01:36:06.587 --> 01:36:08.488]  This is life and death, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:36:08.749 --> 01:36:12.412]  That's why I've been effective, because people can telegraph at an instinctive level.
[01:36:12.972 --> 01:36:16.275]  You know truth from false deep down, folks, and you know I mean what I'm saying.
[01:36:16.555 --> 01:36:19.098]  You know I'm telling you the truth, but don't just go off that feeling.
[01:36:19.318 --> 01:36:21.340]  Go check out the facts and know I'm right.
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:26.384]  This, that's, ladies and gentlemen, this is, it's the time to be counted.
[01:36:26.444 --> 01:36:28.586]  It is the time to stand up and, you know,
[01:36:29.941 --> 01:36:31.162]  I'm not pulling any punches anymore.
[01:36:31.182 --> 01:36:32.742]  In fact, I said I'd get into Israel and 9-11.
[01:36:32.863 --> 01:36:36.604]  And I'm going to do that here in just a few minutes, but I still have to go to calls.
[01:36:37.025 --> 01:36:40.787]  Maybe I'll keep Numbers USA only on for 30 minutes and then cover that in the last 30.
[01:36:40.847 --> 01:36:41.687]  Yeah, I'll do that.
[01:36:41.707 --> 01:36:45.169]  Because I want to take your calls.
[01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:48.751]  Or I could cancel calls and then cover the Israel situation.
[01:36:49.171 --> 01:36:50.672]  But see, I want to do that, give that justice.
[01:36:50.692 --> 01:36:56.935]  I mean, yesterday I'm in the studios of
[01:37:00.686 --> 01:37:08.611]  The local radio station I broadcast a Sunday show out of, and one of the news producers goes, my God, you're going to go on the air and say that LBJ killed Kennedy?
[01:37:08.891 --> 01:37:14.715]  He told the story, I already knew about it, about two different talk show hosts being fired, being marched out of there when the President's family still owned it.
[01:37:14.935 --> 01:37:15.796]  They don't own it anymore.
[01:37:17.077 --> 01:37:20.359]  But just, you might, you know, you might not, if you play that here, you might not want to.
[01:37:20.739 --> 01:37:21.420]  I just said, you know what?
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:21.940]  I'm going to do it.
[01:37:22.901 --> 01:37:23.361]  And you know what?
[01:37:23.441 --> 01:37:25.162]  Used to I wouldn't talk about something like that on air.
[01:37:25.182 --> 01:37:26.163]  I'm talking about it right now.
[01:37:27.045 --> 01:37:29.686]  I mean, it wasn't the station or the company themselves saying that.
[01:37:29.706 --> 01:37:32.688]  It was just... And the person that was talking to me wasn't even being mean.
[01:37:32.708 --> 01:37:33.508]  They were just scared.
[01:37:33.528 --> 01:37:35.389]  I mean, they were basically shaking.
[01:37:35.809 --> 01:37:36.890]  Wouldn't know basically about it.
[01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:39.211]  And I just can't live like that.
[01:37:39.431 --> 01:37:40.792]  Man, I cannot live like that.
[01:37:42.212 --> 01:37:45.994]  You know, people act like it's unusual or brave or heroic to fight evil.
[01:37:46.654 --> 01:37:50.116]  How could we not fight people that run giant child kidnapping rings?
[01:37:51.169 --> 01:37:54.251]  How could we not fight people that spray DU all over the planet?
[01:37:54.571 --> 01:38:00.775]  How could we not fight people that want to have one-shot policies and exterminate most of us and are sterilizing people worldwide?
[01:38:01.096 --> 01:38:07.700]  I mean, how could we not fight a bunch of scum wearing jeweled crowns that are on television right now with George Bush?
[01:38:09.361 --> 01:38:10.462]  I mean, come on!
[01:38:11.722 --> 01:38:12.783]  It's a no-brainer!
[01:38:12.863 --> 01:38:15.545]  I don't even know why it's some big decision for you out there!
[01:38:22.068 --> 01:38:23.609]  So listen, I want you to support us.
[01:38:25.251 --> 01:38:28.653]  We've put it all out there, we've put ourselves on the front line and I need your support.
[01:38:28.713 --> 01:38:36.039]  I want you to go to Infowars.com and I want you to order as many books and videos as you can afford and get them and share them and get them out to the public.
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:42.364]  And I want you to get TerrorStorm and aggressively buy a DVD burner side by side and burn the living daylights out of them.
[01:38:42.985 --> 01:38:45.967]  And I want you to continue, I want to thank those that have been doing that.
[01:38:46.487 --> 01:38:47.828]  And I want you to go to PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:38:50.214 --> 01:38:56.076]  You can get a 15 cent a day membership, $5.95 a month, and download all my films and burn them to disk.
[01:38:56.336 --> 01:38:59.777]  A factory, as I've called it, of resistance against the New World Order.
[01:39:01.758 --> 01:39:03.939]  I want you to go there and I want you to take action.
[01:39:06.259 --> 01:39:07.480]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:09.080]  You already got a membership?
[01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:10.461]  Buy one for your friends or family.
[01:39:10.501 --> 01:39:12.942]  Make up your own access code and give it to them.
[01:39:13.862 --> 01:39:14.862]  You can say, why would I do that?
[01:39:14.922 --> 01:39:16.683]  Why wouldn't I just share the passcode?
[01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:19.430]  Yeah, but then we can't do more.
[01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:20.970]  We can't make more films for you.
[01:39:21.410 --> 01:39:23.771]  We can't put them out for free on Google Video.
[01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:25.892]  You go, well then why should I go join PrisonPlanet.TV?
[01:39:26.212 --> 01:39:28.032]  Well, everything isn't free.
[01:39:28.192 --> 01:39:29.133]  Everything isn't out there.
[01:39:29.153 --> 01:39:33.294]  And it's in a higher bandwidth, higher quality at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:39:33.674 --> 01:39:34.595]  But that's not even the reason.
[01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:35.875]  It's because you support us.
[01:39:38.687 --> 01:39:43.829]  Again, we're gearing up, we're fighting, we're intensifying our actions, our operations against the New World Order.
[01:39:43.849 --> 01:39:45.870]  We're the Sword of Truth, and we need your help.
[01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:54.773]  PrisonPlanet.tv, get a membership, or extend your monthly membership to a yearly membership, or re-up your membership, or... That's the easiest way to donate.
[01:39:54.793 --> 01:39:55.633]  You already got memberships?
[01:39:55.653 --> 01:39:56.714]  Go buy bulk memberships.
[01:39:56.734 --> 01:39:57.354]  Give them as gifts.
[01:39:58.098 --> 01:40:07.165]  Or call toll free to order the books and videos 1-888-253-3139 888-253-3139 You can also write to me and get the books and videos or send a donation if that makes it easier to 3001 South Lamar Suite 100 Austin, Texas 78704
[01:40:22.671 --> 01:40:23.411]  Again, you can write to me.
[01:40:23.451 --> 01:40:27.873]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Street, 100 Austin, TX 78704.
[01:40:29.393 --> 01:40:30.894]  Also, support our sponsors.
[01:40:31.054 --> 01:40:32.674]  I would appreciate that and I thank you for that.
[01:40:33.254 --> 01:40:35.015]  Support the local station sponsors.
[01:40:35.615 --> 01:40:37.436]  If you're a local business, sponsor the show.
[01:40:39.996 --> 01:40:41.817]  Let's all support each other in this movement.
[01:40:43.251 --> 01:40:47.552]  Because what I'm after and what I know you're after is liberty and freedom and defeating these people.
[01:40:47.672 --> 01:40:49.233]  That's what makes my boat float.
[01:40:49.653 --> 01:40:50.693]  That's what makes me tick.
[01:40:51.113 --> 01:40:52.114]  That's what I value.
[01:40:52.414 --> 01:40:53.374]  That's what I'm into.
[01:40:53.674 --> 01:40:55.014]  That's what my vision is.
[01:40:55.334 --> 01:41:01.096]  That's what drives me and the engine of my soul is to beat these people, is to survive.
[01:41:01.116 --> 01:41:03.737]  It isn't just because I want to fight or I'm looking for a fight.
[01:41:04.117 --> 01:41:07.738]  That's engineered into us by God because there was going to be times to fight.
[01:41:08.198 --> 01:41:11.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, and I know I'm fighting the right enemy.
[01:41:11.501 --> 01:41:13.182]  I know I'm standing up for my family.
[01:41:13.702 --> 01:41:26.792]  I know I'm doing what a warrior is supposed to do, and I'm telling you, join me in the info war so we can avert physical conflict, and Lord knows that conflict's probably going to come regardless, but at least it'll be on our terms, and our host will be greater.
[01:41:27.313 --> 01:41:28.433]  Our mass will be greater.
[01:41:29.434 --> 01:41:30.615]  Our army will be greater.
[01:41:30.815 --> 01:41:32.837]  A great host, ready to resist.
[01:41:34.298 --> 01:41:34.918]  Ready to fight.
[01:41:34.978 --> 01:41:35.739]  Ready to struggle.
[01:41:37.785 --> 01:41:40.087]  We're not doing it for power and fame and status.
[01:41:40.107 --> 01:41:41.388]  We're doing it for survival.
[01:41:41.408 --> 01:41:43.190]  We're doing it for the species.
[01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:44.371]  We're doing it for humanity.
[01:41:44.411 --> 01:41:50.336]  We're doing it for the weak, and the widows, and the children, and those that are fed upon by these enemies of humanity.
[01:41:50.356 --> 01:41:55.360]  Alright, let's go to calls.
[01:41:56.241 --> 01:41:56.921]  Who's up first?
[01:41:58.843 --> 01:41:59.904]  Mary in Texas.
[01:41:59.924 --> 01:42:00.524]  You're on the air.
[01:42:00.564 --> 01:42:00.905]  Welcome.
[01:42:01.325 --> 01:42:01.785]  Hello, Dave.
[01:42:02.626 --> 01:42:02.846]  Hi.
[01:42:03.227 --> 01:42:04.368]  Am I on the air?
[01:42:05.148 --> 01:42:05.889]  Yes, you're on the air.
[01:42:07.611 --> 01:42:08.951]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[01:42:10.712 --> 01:42:14.972]  We have Frank Callers calling in and that's what they do.
[01:42:16.773 --> 01:42:18.053]  That was good.
[01:42:19.653 --> 01:42:21.734]  But that's what our country has turned into.
[01:42:22.754 --> 01:42:32.996]  What happens is the stimuli of this information frightens them, but the layers of conditioning and brainwashing affect them to the point of not being able to respond or take action.
[01:42:33.376 --> 01:42:34.996]  Who's next after that person?
[01:42:36.926 --> 01:42:37.987]  Matthew in New York.
[01:42:39.588 --> 01:42:39.908]  Alex.
[01:42:41.209 --> 01:42:41.809]  Yes, welcome.
[01:42:41.829 --> 01:42:42.229]  Go ahead.
[01:42:42.249 --> 01:42:43.550]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:47.532]  Over here working with the We Are Change people at WeAreChange.org.
[01:42:47.552 --> 01:42:54.737]  You've been doing a great job helping promoting us and turning all those truth seekers out there into people who are actually standing and taking action.
[01:42:55.157 --> 01:42:58.079]  But I have more of a legal question for you today, hoping that you can help me out with.
[01:42:59.479 --> 01:43:03.762]  We're setting up this audio video spy camera surveillance system over here in New York.
[01:43:04.369 --> 01:43:11.311]  We're hoping to have our first broadcast over here on Friday, where we're going to have live broadcasts of activist activities going on throughout New York City.
[01:43:12.172 --> 01:43:21.054]  But we're encountering some legislation, I guess, stating that there's federal law that prohibits the recording of any concealed audio equipment.
[01:43:21.655 --> 01:43:32.098]  But yet we're told on the same hand that New York City laws allow the purposes of audio-video surveillance for a conversation between two parties.
[01:43:32.611 --> 01:43:34.132]  And we have some conflicting reports.
[01:43:34.192 --> 01:43:38.616]  So you've had scumbags in the government try to tell you you can't do that?
[01:43:39.376 --> 01:43:40.917]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:43:40.977 --> 01:43:41.898]  Who are the scumbags?
[01:43:42.699 --> 01:43:45.901]  Well, I had a conversation with just one cop, basically.
[01:43:46.201 --> 01:43:48.964]  What do you expect from these scum who work for the... Hold on, hold on.
[01:43:49.004 --> 01:43:49.364]  Let me stop.
[01:43:49.384 --> 01:43:50.084]  Let me put you on hold.
[01:43:50.104 --> 01:43:51.205]  I'm going to talk about this right now.
[01:43:51.686 --> 01:43:54.588]  Look, what do you expect from these dumb people who work for the exterminators?
[01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:56.529]  They're brainwashed.
[01:43:56.589 --> 01:43:57.890]  All they know is petty power.
[01:43:58.451 --> 01:44:00.092]  And all they know how to do is kill this country.
[01:44:00.953 --> 01:44:02.414]  And yeah, you're scum when you do that.
[01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:06.990]  We have New York Police walking up on tape and going, Oh, he's got a bomb!
[01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:11.451]  I know you don't have one, but I'm going to send you to jail for it, unless you stop your demonstration.
[01:44:12.671 --> 01:44:14.632]  They don't even think frame-ups are illegal now.
[01:44:14.892 --> 01:44:15.232]  You understand?
[01:44:15.272 --> 01:44:16.812]  That's how warped their minds are.
[01:44:18.373 --> 01:44:26.294]  All those guys know how to do is act cool, act manly, go to Yankees games, and try to live in a nicer place and have nicer clothes to look more efficient in front of people.
[01:44:28.535 --> 01:44:29.035]  You understand?
[01:44:30.678 --> 01:44:34.719]  And so, yeah, police all over the country will go, you're not allowed to record me!
[01:44:34.959 --> 01:44:36.079]  It's illegal!
[01:44:36.479 --> 01:44:37.800]  It's a wiretap!
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:40.280]  It's the eavesdropping law!
[01:44:41.221 --> 01:44:44.401]  Okay, let me tell you, this is the deal.
[01:44:45.001 --> 01:44:50.923]  A woman emailed me a few days ago and said, I went out in front of one of these pet stores that has puppy mill animals,
[01:44:51.773 --> 01:44:54.214]  And I said, don't buy them from here, they're puppy mill animals.
[01:44:54.254 --> 01:45:01.277]  And the police came, even though I was on the sidewalk of the city, outside the place, and said, you have to have a permit to protest, you're going to be arrested.
[01:45:01.317 --> 01:45:02.637]  And they asked me, is that the case?
[01:45:03.758 --> 01:45:05.398]  It's been thrown out by every court.
[01:45:05.658 --> 01:45:06.358]  It's illegal.
[01:45:06.479 --> 01:45:07.639]  It's unconstitutional.
[01:45:08.343 --> 01:45:12.148]  But the police have been brainwashed and believe it's a privilege now to protest.
[01:45:12.468 --> 01:45:14.791]  Just like they believe the drive is, or the Second Amendment is.
[01:45:15.211 --> 01:45:15.952]  They've been lied to.
[01:45:15.972 --> 01:45:17.334]  They're just dumb like the general public.
[01:45:17.734 --> 01:45:23.761]  Again, most members of Congress, the chairman of the committee can't tell you who a Sunni and a Shiite is, but they make Iraq decisions.
[01:45:25.022 --> 01:45:26.184]  It's designed for this.
[01:45:27.105 --> 01:45:28.987]  Okay, so yes, you could be arrested.
[01:45:29.688 --> 01:45:31.309]  And there could be a price of liberty.
[01:45:31.770 --> 01:45:37.974]  But if you don't plea bargain, and you demand a jury trial, they will lose nine times out of ten.
[01:45:37.994 --> 01:45:39.515]  And then what are you going to have if you even lose?
[01:45:39.815 --> 01:45:40.436]  A misdemeanor.
[01:45:40.476 --> 01:45:41.196]  Then you appeal it.
[01:45:41.917 --> 01:45:43.678]  You make a sacrifice for freedom.
[01:45:43.918 --> 01:45:44.679]  It isn't free.
[01:45:44.959 --> 01:45:46.680]  But you don't fight for it over in Iraq.
[01:45:46.861 --> 01:45:48.001]  You fight for it right here.
[01:45:50.523 --> 01:45:56.708]  Now, Connecticut and New York and one other state, coming to Maryland, have laws
[01:45:57.848 --> 01:46:00.830]  Against recording someone over a telephone without telling them.
[01:46:03.092 --> 01:46:08.395]  But those, many of those have been found to be unconstitutional and overturned, but they keep them on the books and keep enforcing.
[01:46:08.675 --> 01:46:10.857]  So you used to have a law that was found unconstitutional, they removed it.
[01:46:11.197 --> 01:46:14.379]  Now they just keep it and pay out the damages for it.
[01:46:14.399 --> 01:46:18.382]  Just like failure to ID's, there's no law you gotta show cops when you're walking down the street an ID.
[01:46:18.562 --> 01:46:19.342]  They'll still arrest you.
[01:46:19.463 --> 01:46:20.523]  There's been hundreds of cases.
[01:46:20.763 --> 01:46:23.105]  There have been two Supreme Court cases out of Austin, Texas.
[01:46:23.805 --> 01:46:24.346]  One in the 70's, one in 86.
[01:46:26.751 --> 01:46:29.753]  They still will arrest you for no ID walking down the street.
[01:46:30.554 --> 01:46:31.114]  They don't care.
[01:46:31.194 --> 01:46:32.675]  They'll use your tax money to pay it off.
[01:46:33.215 --> 01:46:34.616]  It's called criminality.
[01:46:36.417 --> 01:46:36.777]  Okay?
[01:46:39.579 --> 01:46:40.279]  So, no.
[01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:44.142]  When you're out there, you are allowed to videotape whatever you want undercover.
[01:46:44.162 --> 01:46:45.262]  What do you think the media does?
[01:46:45.282 --> 01:46:46.443]  What do you think cops do?
[01:46:46.783 --> 01:46:48.484]  The cops are putting hidden cameras.
[01:46:48.825 --> 01:46:51.306]  You know, there's three hidden cameras in many cities.
[01:46:51.546 --> 01:46:52.487]  That's the number I've seen.
[01:46:52.807 --> 01:46:55.849]  Three hidden cameras for every visible camera you can see.
[01:46:57.012 --> 01:46:58.373]  They got cameras on you.
[01:46:58.613 --> 01:47:01.656]  These are cops that already walked up and said, you've got bombs!
[01:47:02.136 --> 01:47:06.099]  And then say, we know you don't have them, but we're still gonna put you in the hole for 30 days.
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:09.202]  So yes, you're going up against criminals.
[01:47:09.542 --> 01:47:13.445]  Everybody knows the New York Police Department's worked for the Mafia for at least a hundred years.
[01:47:13.465 --> 01:47:16.748]  I mean, you know, you're working for actual mobsters.
[01:47:17.148 --> 01:47:18.449]  What do you think's gonna happen?
[01:47:20.531 --> 01:47:22.172]  What do you, how do you think things really run?
[01:47:27.168 --> 01:47:29.609]  How do you think this stuff operates?
[01:47:31.571 --> 01:47:35.553]  How do you think the world works?
[01:47:37.452 --> 01:47:40.973]  So, they may walk up and drop a bag of cocaine on you, man!
[01:47:41.013 --> 01:47:51.437]  You need that hidden camera, and you need a set-up camera, or somebody that stays a hundred yards away, that once they arrive, you know, is drinking coffee, or in a phone booth, or, you know, whatever, to surveil them.
[01:47:51.517 --> 01:47:54.658]  And guaranteed, New York Intelligence is now listening to this show.
[01:47:54.678 --> 01:48:03.661]  So, you want another backup camera, a person that is scheduled to walk up in ten minutes, and then walk back and forth, so they can't make you.
[01:48:04.202 --> 01:48:04.822]  You've got to run,
[01:48:06.914 --> 01:48:08.495]  Counterintelligence against them.
[01:48:10.676 --> 01:48:16.258]  And yes, folks, I've had Special Forces troops chase me through swamps on dune buggies.
[01:48:17.339 --> 01:48:20.320]  And I didn't stop and confront them because I didn't want to.
[01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:24.422]  I mean, can you imagine what would have happened if I would have physically started fighting back against the troops?
[01:48:24.462 --> 01:48:25.202]  They would have set me up.
[01:48:25.502 --> 01:48:26.623]  They had local police with them.
[01:48:27.538 --> 01:48:32.744]  And, uh, they were trying to get the footage we had, which turned out, you see the helicopters flying over us and they're chasing us.
[01:48:33.264 --> 01:48:36.227]  We interviewed locals who were in the backs of their houses, saw the dune buggies chasing us.
[01:48:36.487 --> 01:48:37.629]  I mean, through the swamps, folks.
[01:48:37.889 --> 01:48:41.473]  Because I was in Brooksville, Florida, on city property.
[01:48:42.053 --> 01:48:46.298]  And the cops pull up later and say, we'll get you for trespassing if you walk in any of the city woods.
[01:48:48.019 --> 01:48:48.500]  Because they had
[01:48:50.091 --> 01:48:53.972]  The Army Rangers and Special Forces above them running some takeover drill of the town.
[01:48:54.472 --> 01:48:59.573]  And we got locals saying, yeah, they came to my house with machine guns and said, don't talk to Alex Jones, he's crazy.
[01:49:00.253 --> 01:49:01.873]  Yeah, I mean, that's all in the takeover.
[01:49:01.893 --> 01:49:04.834]  I mean, this is real, folks.
[01:49:04.914 --> 01:49:11.435]  Okay, we've had Special Forces walk up in San Antonio and point guns at us and have us get down on the ground and take our videotapes and erase them.
[01:49:11.635 --> 01:49:13.115]  That got picked up by World Net Daily.
[01:49:14.635 --> 01:49:19.496]  Yes, I've had MPs with guns walk up and stick them to my chest, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:20.373 --> 01:49:23.575]  Okay, I've had troops in America stick guns to my chest.
[01:49:23.895 --> 01:49:25.917]  This stuff's real, okay?
[01:49:26.437 --> 01:49:28.298]  We're here fighting for America!
[01:49:28.618 --> 01:49:29.719]  Fighting for the Republic!
[01:49:29.879 --> 01:49:31.820]  The last-ditch resistance!
[01:49:32.661 --> 01:49:34.422]  They're talking about arresting people like me.
[01:49:34.462 --> 01:49:35.883]  They're talking about putting us in camps.
[01:49:36.783 --> 01:49:39.305]  They're trying to make their move, and we're standing up to them.
[01:49:39.325 --> 01:49:43.228]  We're not acting like Germany or Russia, and we're fighting them toe-to-toe, publicly.
[01:49:43.408 --> 01:49:45.229]  We're not cowering, and we're gonna win!
[01:49:52.623 --> 01:49:55.827]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:56.148 --> 01:49:58.110]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:49:58.471 --> 01:50:06.101]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:06.795 --> 01:50:13.859]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:14.259 --> 01:50:25.725]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:25.985 --> 01:50:29.487]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:29.948 --> 01:50:31.869]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:32.209 --> 01:50:36.071]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:51.317 --> 01:51:55.018]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:55.338 --> 01:51:57.539]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.

[01:52:09.523 --> 01:52:18.533]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[01:53:24.728 --> 01:53:27.069]  Yeah, Strange Days have found us.
[01:53:27.089 --> 01:53:27.930]  They've tracked us down.
[01:53:30.456 --> 01:53:31.997]  I'll tell you, he's saying it well.
[01:53:33.017 --> 01:53:36.358]  Roy in Michigan, then Andrew in Missouri and others.
[01:53:36.398 --> 01:53:37.138]  Go ahead, Roy.
[01:53:40.079 --> 01:53:40.379]  Hello?
[01:53:40.699 --> 01:53:41.500]  Yes, go ahead, sir.
[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:51.203]  Yeah, Alex, a trucker friend of mine just called me from Elwood, Kansas, and he said that
[01:53:52.383 --> 01:54:00.148]  He went into the post office to pick up his mail, and they told him that he couldn't get any mail because they were flooding that town this evening.
[01:54:00.208 --> 01:54:04.451]  And he said that he could see that the traffic is all moving out of town there.
[01:54:04.471 --> 01:54:06.633]  They're supposed to flood it tonight.
[01:54:07.573 --> 01:54:08.814]  And I didn't know if you knew anything about it.
[01:54:08.834 --> 01:54:09.214]  What are they doing?
[01:54:09.234 --> 01:54:09.555]  Blowing up?
[01:54:09.595 --> 01:54:13.978]  You know, they're busy blowing up many of the old dams to re-flood things for the earth.
[01:54:14.038 --> 01:54:15.098]  Is that what was happening?
[01:54:15.859 --> 01:54:16.779]  Uh, he wasn't.
[01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:18.501]  He didn't know what the hell was happening.
[01:54:19.767 --> 01:54:29.977]  You know, he's been on the road for some time and when he went in to get his mail, he just said that they told him that he couldn't get his mail because they were flooding the town with it.
[01:54:30.217 --> 01:54:32.339]  Well, that's an interesting question.
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:33.420]  Do you have the internet?
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:35.322]  You can type it into a search engine and find out.
[01:54:37.584 --> 01:54:38.846]  What's the name of the town again?
[01:54:38.866 --> 01:54:42.049]  It's Elwood, Kansas.
[01:54:44.392 --> 01:54:45.412]  All right, I'll check into it.
[01:54:45.672 --> 01:54:46.593]  Anything else on your mind?
[01:54:47.093 --> 01:54:49.513]  The global plan to exterminate the population?
[01:54:49.553 --> 01:54:54.254]  Or maybe Bruce Willis going public on the JFK assassination?
[01:54:54.854 --> 01:54:58.695]  Well, they may have a lot of plans, but they ain't gonna do anything that God does not allow.
[01:55:00.676 --> 01:55:02.516]  My plan is a real simple one.
[01:55:02.556 --> 01:55:05.477]  Get your food and guns and get a place to hide yourself.
[01:55:06.137 --> 01:55:13.739]  Because that National ID, when that comes into place, I don't know what other people are gonna do, but I ain't taking it.
[01:55:14.847 --> 01:55:19.629]  And the ones that want to resist, they better get prepared right now.
[01:55:19.869 --> 01:55:20.670]  Well, they still can.
[01:55:20.910 --> 01:55:26.692]  Yeah, people need to just start saying no to the toll roads, no to the national IDs, no to national sales taxes.
[01:55:27.373 --> 01:55:29.754]  But they're really slick at selling all of it to us.
[01:55:30.274 --> 01:55:39.958]  Well, the national ID, once they take the national ID, then they can stop pretending that they're not slaves.
[01:55:39.998 --> 01:55:41.139]  But see, they don't even know.
[01:55:41.199 --> 01:55:42.779]  They don't call it a national ID.
[01:55:42.799 --> 01:55:43.940]  They call it real ID.
[01:55:45.353 --> 01:55:47.955]  And it's still got the state name on it, so they don't know any better.
[01:55:47.975 --> 01:55:50.416]  It's like, we're in the North American Union.
[01:55:50.476 --> 01:55:52.197]  It just merged last week with the EU.
[01:55:52.217 --> 01:55:54.038]  It had been merging quietly for decades.
[01:55:54.538 --> 01:55:57.260]  And the general public doesn't even know that there's a North American Union.
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:02.503]  A lot of people we talked to on the street, we did a man on the street for the film I'm making, don't even know what the EU is.
[01:56:02.523 --> 01:56:03.803]  They think that's a conspiracy.
[01:56:05.504 --> 01:56:10.087]  I mean, literally, either people know what's going on, or they're totally oblivious.
[01:56:10.876 --> 01:56:13.477]  And I'd say about half the public knows we're in deep doo-doo.
[01:56:13.917 --> 01:56:16.637]  The other half literally doesn't know their head from a hole in the ground.
[01:56:17.097 --> 01:56:20.078]  That's about the way that I see it, too.
[01:56:20.098 --> 01:56:35.702]  I have dubbed so many videos and so much evidence over the years that, you know, there's just no way that if anybody was that's too afraid to take a look at that that they wouldn't be
[01:56:37.486 --> 01:56:42.711]  You know, people running from those government offices.
[01:56:43.231 --> 01:56:44.733]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:56:45.353 --> 01:56:54.822]  I'm going to put the call out to the listeners right now to go up to presentplanet.com and get the incredible Bruce Willis story that we have out.
[01:56:54.882 --> 01:56:56.584]  This is extremely exciting.
[01:56:57.444 --> 01:57:01.528]  We told you behind the scenes now 10, 11 months ago.
[01:57:03.462 --> 01:57:08.724]  That Bruce Willis was awake to 9-11 and had seen Marshall Law and Terror Storm that Rick Linklater gave him.
[01:57:09.184 --> 01:57:15.786]  Rick read to me over the phone one day the email from Bruce Willis about how he'd woken up, he'd totally changed his paradigm, he saw the New World Order now.
[01:57:16.646 --> 01:57:19.087]  Rick, out of the blue, went public with that on air months later.
[01:57:20.328 --> 01:57:22.248]  And then later I found out some other stuff about Bruce Willis.
[01:57:22.588 --> 01:57:27.650]  Now he's gone public saying we have a shadow government still running things after the JFK assassination.
[01:57:29.255 --> 01:57:34.139]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:45.732 --> 01:57:46.372]  Big Brother.
[01:57:47.032 --> 01:57:48.073]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:48.793 --> 01:57:49.914]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:50.574 --> 01:57:51.374]  You want answers?
[01:57:52.135 --> 01:57:53.115]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:53.695 --> 01:57:57.357]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:57.877 --> 01:58:01.979]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:22.517 --> 01:58:32.824]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we have got one of the head honchos over at Numbers USA scheduled to be joining us here in just a few minutes.
[01:58:35.086 --> 01:58:41.691]  In the last hour, we'll be taking calls later in this hour, I got into
[01:58:44.460 --> 01:58:47.241]  The call for a global one-child policy.
[01:58:47.261 --> 01:58:49.462]  And that's exactly what's being pushed.
[01:58:49.502 --> 01:58:50.203]  Here are the headlines.
[01:58:50.283 --> 01:58:54.525]  ICO extremists want world population to drop below 1 billion.
[01:58:56.606 --> 01:58:57.446]  That's one headline.
[01:58:57.486 --> 01:58:58.027]  Here's another one.
[01:58:58.307 --> 01:59:00.348]  Having large families is an eco-crime.
[01:59:00.668 --> 01:59:01.428]  Times of London.
[01:59:04.129 --> 01:59:07.491]  And here's another report out of the News of Australia.
[01:59:07.511 --> 01:59:11.333]  And that says children bad for planet.
[01:59:12.068 --> 01:59:17.330]  And they go on to say the worst children are the children of the West, or of the industrialized world.
[01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:18.251]  They single out the West.
[01:59:18.911 --> 01:59:23.313]  Well, Japan has like a 1.2 population growth, which is actually negative.
[01:59:23.333 --> 01:59:23.493]  It's a 1.2.
[01:59:23.973 --> 01:59:28.575]  That's improper to say population growth.
[01:59:28.595 --> 01:59:30.956]  1.2 children per parent.
[01:59:31.436 --> 01:59:33.157]  Europe, 1.5 on average.
[01:59:33.197 --> 01:59:36.658]  Some are as low as that, or some as high as 1.7.
[01:59:38.479 --> 01:59:41.080]  But the third world's having an average of over four children.
[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:48.142]  But don't worry, let's exterminate the population crowd.
[01:59:49.182 --> 01:59:51.984]  With the IMF and World Bank, they're saying, get rid of the West.
[01:59:52.084 --> 01:59:53.124]  We're the real problem.
[01:59:54.685 --> 01:59:56.065]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:59:57.266 --> 02:00:03.329]  Joining us is Roy Beck, author and lecturer, Executive Director of Numbers USA.
[02:00:03.369 --> 02:00:04.109]  He's been one of the most
[02:00:04.853 --> 02:00:11.440]  Visible chroniclers and spokesmen on the effects of mass immigration on equality of life issues in the United States.
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:16.105]  The Houston Chronicle labeled him one of the five leading thinkers in the national immigration debate.
[02:00:16.966 --> 02:00:19.709]  Very intellectual, very well documented, very well done.
[02:00:19.729 --> 02:00:24.674]  We've many times put some of the documentary presentations he's done on the local cable channel.
[02:00:24.794 --> 02:00:27.057]  It's one of the most highly requested programs to re-air.
[02:00:27.717 --> 02:00:31.920]  We've got links up to his website at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:33.221]  He'll be with us for the next half hour.
[02:00:33.241 --> 02:00:54.277]  And I'd like him to just give his basic presentation, but my first question to him is, we have the liberal crowd, you could call them, saying, oh, all humans are bad, get rid of 90% of the world's population, but then they say it's all because of carbon emission, let's get rid of the West, which is already literally dying, as Pat Buchanan wrote, the death of the West,
[02:00:55.230 --> 02:01:03.022]  Uh, and then there's no discussion about the third world, and then overall, once a country industrializes, you do get negative population growth, so the answer would be...
[02:01:04.409 --> 02:01:08.450]  Don't let the industrialized countries be swamped with the third world.
[02:01:08.850 --> 02:01:12.291]  Industrialize and clean up the third world, and then help these people.
[02:01:12.952 --> 02:01:21.034]  Instead, the academics go, no, just let them die in a squalor, let them keep breeding, but let's stop Japanese and Germans from breeding.
[02:01:21.334 --> 02:01:21.994]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:01:22.654 --> 02:01:23.615]  Hi, Alex, Roy here.
[02:01:24.535 --> 02:01:26.456]  Yeah, Roy, it's great to have you with us.
[02:01:26.496 --> 02:01:27.656]  We've only got one minute before we break.
[02:01:27.696 --> 02:01:29.597]  In a nutshell, tell us about your organization.
[02:01:30.357 --> 02:01:30.837]  Numbers USA.
[02:01:31.849 --> 02:01:34.191]  We're actually just celebrating our 10th anniversary.
[02:01:34.211 --> 02:01:37.233]  That's kind of sad because I wish we'd accomplished more.
[02:01:38.634 --> 02:01:43.458]  We were started in 1997 to carry out the recommendations of the bipartisan U.S.
[02:01:43.498 --> 02:01:49.662]  Commission on Immigration Reform, which was chaired by former Texan Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.
[02:01:50.463 --> 02:01:59.610]  That bipartisan commission in 1995 and 1996 recommended that the country become serious about stopping illegal immigration.
[02:02:00.477 --> 02:02:08.544]  Primarily by taking the jobs from them, making sure that they could not get jobs in America, and also making sure that they go back home.
[02:02:09.064 --> 02:02:17.631]  Absolutely opposed to amnesty, and recommended that legal immigration be reduced considerably back toward more traditional levels.
[02:02:17.791 --> 02:02:24.376]  Now you break down with stunning clarity the crisis we face.
[02:02:26.014 --> 02:02:26.595]  Stay there, sir.
[02:02:26.615 --> 02:02:32.564]  We'll be back after three minutes, and I want to go right back to you to walk through the... Now, these are official numbers.
[02:02:32.604 --> 02:02:35.989]  These are non-debatable, conservative numbers he's going to give you.
[02:02:36.049 --> 02:02:38.252]  It's, frankly, much worse than what you're about to hear.
[02:02:38.272 --> 02:02:39.214]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[02:02:44.429 --> 02:02:49.873]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:50.253 --> 02:02:57.858]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:02:58.590 --> 02:03:05.634]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:06.034 --> 02:03:17.460]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:21.703]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:21.743 --> 02:03:23.664]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:24.004 --> 02:03:27.846]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:38.410 --> 02:04:43.832]  Do you know that you can go solar for under $1,200 now?
[02:04:44.352 --> 02:04:45.492]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[02:04:45.672 --> 02:04:49.854]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[02:04:50.434 --> 02:04:55.316]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[02:04:55.836 --> 02:05:02.259]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[02:05:02.999 --> 02:05:05.700]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[02:05:05.860 --> 02:05:15.821]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak converter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[02:05:16.101 --> 02:05:19.802]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[02:05:19.842 --> 02:05:26.343]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[02:05:26.523 --> 02:05:27.563]  Are you ready to go solar?
[02:05:27.763 --> 02:05:28.723]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.
[02:05:32.624 --> 02:05:36.686]  Or order them on the website at a 10% discount on kensolar.com.
[02:05:36.926 --> 02:05:39.287]  That's kensolar.com.
[02:05:42.569 --> 02:05:48.592]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:49.192 --> 02:05:52.234]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:55.035 --> 02:06:01.438]  There are now six and a half billion people, those numbers just came out this year with the global census projection,
[02:06:02.973 --> 02:06:16.106]  By 2050, they're looking at 9.5 to 10 billion, which is certainly a large load on the planet, but the real environmental threat, of course, is the genetic engineering and issues like that, which the Globalist never want to talk about.
[02:06:16.686 --> 02:06:25.014]  But when we look at the Western world, which geographically and population-wise is, well, the U.S.
[02:06:25.034 --> 02:06:28.077]  population is only 5% of the world's population, to give you an idea.
[02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:34.808]  And 5% of the world population is being overrun by 90% of the population that wants to come here.
[02:06:34.848 --> 02:06:38.433]  That other 5% of the world in Europe has everybody wanting to go there.
[02:06:40.296 --> 02:06:45.703]  And so to talk about these numbers, he does a presentation on video that you can check out at numbersusa.com.
[02:06:47.903 --> 02:06:50.765]  That's just NumbersUSA.com.
[02:06:50.805 --> 02:06:52.345]  Numbers, plural, USA.com.
[02:06:52.365 --> 02:06:58.709]  You can go there and watch the presentations online, or I suggest you get the DVD from him so you have a hard copy of it.
[02:06:59.289 --> 02:07:02.190]  Just absolutely scary info.
[02:07:02.631 --> 02:07:04.111]  And he is the head of the organization.
[02:07:04.331 --> 02:07:05.632]  He's testified to Congress.
[02:07:06.392 --> 02:07:13.216]  You heard him talk about back in 1985 meeting with a Barbara Jordan, now deceased, from Austin, Texas, who was a liberal and saw the threat here.
[02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:18.903]  I mean, by the way, a lot of mainline liberals are, of course, realize what's happening.
[02:07:18.943 --> 02:07:19.884]  So do conservatives.
[02:07:19.944 --> 02:07:26.248]  It's just the leadership of both parties is bought and paid for by big corporations that want the cheap labor on the quarterly basis.
[02:07:26.849 --> 02:07:28.550]  It's already blown out the welfare system.
[02:07:28.590 --> 02:07:29.971]  It's already blown out everything.
[02:07:30.991 --> 02:07:31.872]  And it's just going to get worse.
[02:07:31.912 --> 02:07:37.836]  But but but here to give us a presentation, we appreciate him joining us is Roy Beck, executive director of Numbers USA.
[02:07:38.136 --> 02:07:43.680]  Roy, walk through it, you know, boil it down to the listeners what we're talking about demographically and what it's going to do to the country.
[02:07:46.342 --> 02:07:47.242]  This comes from the U.S.
[02:07:47.262 --> 02:07:50.805]  Census Bureau, so this is not something from an advocacy group.
[02:07:51.866 --> 02:07:59.311]  The Census Bureau has done projections, and basically projections are if you assume certain things happen, mathematically, what will happen in the future?
[02:07:59.831 --> 02:08:10.459]  And the Census Bureau assumed on its latest projections about four years ago, they assumed that our birth rates and our death rates would remain about the same.
[02:08:10.619 --> 02:08:11.620]  And there's a lot to be
[02:08:12.256 --> 02:08:14.379]  There's a lot to suggest that that's about right.
[02:08:15.180 --> 02:08:27.174]  The second thing they assumed was that illegal immigration would be substantially gotten under control in the near future, and that legal immigration would be reduced by about 10%.
[02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:34.525]  So, in other words, they're assuming conditions that are far more conservative than what we have at this time.
[02:08:34.605 --> 02:08:36.446]  It's actually about 5,000 times worse.
[02:08:36.506 --> 02:08:41.130]  But with very conservative government whitewash numbers, we're in a crisis.
[02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:46.234]  So we're, just recognize that in 1970 we had 203 million people in America.
[02:08:46.674 --> 02:08:49.937]  We just crossed 300 million last fall.
[02:08:50.718 --> 02:08:56.322]  And we're going to cross, we're going to cross a half billion shortly after the middle of this century.
[02:08:56.402 --> 02:08:57.643]  A half billion.
[02:08:59.554 --> 02:09:02.775]  And headed to about 600 million at the end of this century.
[02:09:02.815 --> 02:09:06.795]  This is the Census Bureau's projection if we get illegal immigration under control.
[02:09:07.235 --> 02:09:09.556]  And if we reduce legal immigration by about 10%.
[02:09:10.496 --> 02:09:13.536]  So you can see what a terrible situation we're in.
[02:09:13.636 --> 02:09:28.319]  We gotta get a control of illegal immigration and we need to reduce legal immigration by about 75% if we're going to be able to slow our population growth to about 100 million this century instead of adding another 300 million.
[02:09:29.481 --> 02:09:47.768]  I mean, so everybody who lives, especially in the coastal areas, you know, which is within about 200 miles of the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf Coast, or the Great Lakes, we're already, everybody who lives in those kind of regions already lives very, very congested, regimented lifestyles.
[02:09:49.808 --> 02:09:56.491]  Right now, Congress has plans for us to have double that over the century.
[02:09:56.591 --> 02:09:57.431]  Our grandchildren
[02:09:57.802 --> 02:10:01.343]  are going to live in an America that we just absolutely would not recognize.
[02:10:04.124 --> 02:10:05.505]  Please keep walking through this.
[02:10:05.545 --> 02:10:06.785]  Give them the actual numbers.
[02:10:07.106 --> 02:10:12.307]  So the actual, so, so you've got, again, we're sitting at $300 million right now.
[02:10:13.868 --> 02:10:18.710]  Under the Census Bureau projections, we would be at $420 million at mid-century.
[02:10:18.970 --> 02:10:24.232]  But you just, you've got to remember that, that's if, that's if Congress really makes some big improvements.
[02:10:25.281 --> 02:10:37.307]  The indications are that there are projections that have been not made by the Census Bureau, but by private demographers who take just actually what we have now, and it suggests that we may hit a half billion by 2050.
[02:10:37.487 --> 02:10:41.349]  Instead of 420 million, we may hit 500 million by that point.
[02:10:41.689 --> 02:10:46.612]  So, that's the thing that changes every aspect of American life.
[02:10:47.372 --> 02:10:53.375]  When you look at infrastructure in this country, our roads, our bridges,
[02:10:54.785 --> 02:11:04.075]  Our sewage treatment, our wastewater systems, all of the kinds of systems that we've got in this country that were built up mainly over the last hundred years, these are deteriorating.
[02:11:04.215 --> 02:11:09.962]  They need to be replaced, but they can't be replaced because we're so busy accommodating this massive growth.
[02:11:11.859 --> 02:11:12.940]  Now, let's be clear about that.
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:17.865]  Every few days now, a railroad carousel, or every month, a bridge falls down.
[02:11:18.786 --> 02:11:22.789]  We know that over half of the city health department budget in L.A.
[02:11:22.829 --> 02:11:23.750]  is for illegal aliens.
[02:11:24.191 --> 02:11:27.894]  We know that over 90% of the felony murder warrants are for illegal aliens.
[02:11:28.294 --> 02:11:32.739]  We know about 30% of the people in the prisons in California are illegal aliens.
[02:11:32.819 --> 02:11:34.060]  Same numbers now in Texas.
[02:11:34.660 --> 02:11:43.153]  We know that the corporations love this because the illegals come in here and work, and they get subsidized with welfare on top of it, with record welfare fraud.
[02:11:43.513 --> 02:11:48.420]  The police are told not to enforce against them, then to enforce on us to raise funds for that.
[02:11:50.223 --> 02:11:53.664]  You're right, because I actually read the real numbers on infrastructure.
[02:11:54.144 --> 02:12:05.586]  The only new infrastructure being built is going to be foreign-owned toll roads and things like that for the wealthy, and they haven't put in new rail beds in over a hundred years in this country.
[02:12:05.606 --> 02:12:08.266]  You know, the trains are going 300 miles an hour in Europe.
[02:12:08.306 --> 02:12:15.488]  They can't even go 35 miles an hour here now, because they're so... I mean, literally, it's like someone made the decision to destroy America.
[02:12:16.748 --> 02:12:19.010]  Yeah, and that's the sad thing.
[02:12:19.130 --> 02:12:21.072]  I don't think anybody did make that decision.
[02:12:21.092 --> 02:12:27.637]  I mean, I think that there are a lot of these far-out leftist and neo-communist groups that that is their idea.
[02:12:27.677 --> 02:12:29.539]  They push immigration because they want to destroy America.
[02:12:29.859 --> 02:12:40.188]  But I don't think that the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and the heads of the Republican and Democratic national parties want to destroy America.
[02:12:40.208 --> 02:12:45.452]  But they're absolutely careless in their public policy, and they're absolutely callous
[02:12:45.874 --> 02:12:48.377]  To the needs and concerns of just regular Americans.
[02:12:48.957 --> 02:12:50.819]  And you bring up a point on the subsidies.
[02:12:51.580 --> 02:13:01.549]  Here's a case where, it's not the majority of businesses, but it's a large minority of businesses with loud money, going through lobbyists like the U.S.
[02:13:01.569 --> 02:13:06.134]  Chamber of Commerce, and they push this through because they get labor that's cheap to them.
[02:13:06.534 --> 02:13:10.398]  But the American taxpayer has to subsidize every one of those foreign workers
[02:13:11.139 --> 02:13:15.801]  That comes into work, well I shouldn't say everyone, but most of the foreign workers that come to work for them.
[02:13:15.881 --> 02:13:22.884]  For example, the Heritage Foundation just did a study, the best that's been done so far, and it surprised us.
[02:13:23.184 --> 02:13:35.449]  They looked at the less educated foreign workers and looked at their households, and the vast majority of foreign workers are less educated.
[02:13:36.027 --> 02:13:43.673]  And they counted every tax that that household pays, including buying lottery tickets, anything that they pay through rent, etc.
[02:13:43.713 --> 02:13:52.479]  They found that these foreign worker headed households, less educated, pay about $10,000 a year in total taxes.
[02:13:53.140 --> 02:13:58.704]  But, they use about $32,000 in total services and infrastructure.
[02:13:59.164 --> 02:14:03.207]  That means that every time we let a foreign worker come into this country,
[02:14:04.475 --> 02:14:08.097]  We are having to subsidize $22,000 every year!
[02:14:08.637 --> 02:14:09.038]  Every year!
[02:14:09.378 --> 02:14:10.879]  And so this is an average.
[02:14:10.899 --> 02:14:18.243]  So for the whole rest of their lives, we're talking about providing about a half million dollars of subsidy for every one of these.
[02:14:18.623 --> 02:14:19.643]  Why would we do that?
[02:14:20.324 --> 02:14:29.769]  And the answer is, we do it because it's a way to put money in the pockets of the few who are able to lobby Congress and the President to get that policy.
[02:14:30.307 --> 02:14:34.270]  But it's absolutely taking the money out of the pockets of everybody else.
[02:14:50.862 --> 02:14:52.463]  I mean, you say they aren't doing it on purpose.
[02:14:52.503 --> 02:14:55.045]  The globalists have said they want to get rid of the United States.
[02:14:55.086 --> 02:14:56.487]  Even Lou Dobbins said that.
[02:14:56.527 --> 02:14:57.387]  That's a different issue.
[02:14:58.929 --> 02:15:03.252]  But they're sacrificing America for the New World Order.
[02:15:03.312 --> 02:15:10.318]  If you're talking about they're destroying the United States as a sovereign nation, yes, I think that is on purpose.
[02:15:11.077 --> 02:15:15.099]  I don't think they're necessarily trying to destroy the United States so that it becomes a total basket.
[02:15:15.239 --> 02:15:15.980]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:15:16.020 --> 02:15:20.962]  Just a few million Muslims riot in Europe and bring it to a halt.
[02:15:21.743 --> 02:15:34.109]  I mean, the ratio, I haven't done the math, but I know the ratio of just Latin American illegals is probably, you know, ten times that the ratio they have in Europe for, you know, the Algerians and the rest of them.
[02:15:34.709 --> 02:15:40.411]  And I mean, my God, they're always talking about how they can't wait to burn everything down, and it looks like that's getting pretty close.
[02:15:40.431 --> 02:15:42.032]  Do you think that'll be the final wake-up call?
[02:15:43.392 --> 02:15:46.953]  Well, you know, I just don't know.
[02:15:47.193 --> 02:15:49.394]  You never hope for violence to occur.
[02:15:49.414 --> 02:16:00.798]  On the other hand, if violence were to occur, it might be the kind of thing that would cause the American people to finally insist before their nation is lost.
[02:16:02.070 --> 02:16:04.952]  They might finally insist that something be done.
[02:16:05.432 --> 02:16:11.916]  I think it is a situation where most Americans do not have any real sense of how dire it is.
[02:16:12.216 --> 02:16:20.962]  They do not understand that the elites of the country are tied in, much more tied into the elites of the world than they are tied into their own fellow countrymen.
[02:16:21.042 --> 02:16:30.868]  Well, also, fellow countrymen, most of us don't speak Spanish, so we don't know what's being said and written, and the names of most radio stations now are the Invader, the Takeover, the Usurper.
[02:16:31.708 --> 02:16:36.991]  And, uh, it just absolutely makes my head spin because I have so many Hispanic friends.
[02:16:37.051 --> 02:16:50.439]  I grew up with Hispanics, love Hispanics, good people, and then they're Americans, they're shocked by what's going on, and then meanwhile, literally, folks, uh, you don't go in some Mexican food restaurants now because they're basically like, we don't want you here.
[02:16:50.759 --> 02:16:56.242]  There's really also this anti-American nationalism, radical Mexican nationalism, isn't there?
[02:16:57.142 --> 02:17:08.229]  Well, you know, I don't live in the middle of that, because I'm here in Washington, D.C., and I'm in the middle of a gigantic immigration settlement, but it's much more mixed.
[02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:22.678]  I don't have the experience that people in South Florida and all of Texas and all of Arizona and California have, but my understanding from visiting and from people talking to me is, yes, there is a much more radical
[02:17:23.314 --> 02:17:25.476]  Uh, kind of culture that's developing.
[02:17:25.776 --> 02:17:36.043]  It partly develops because if you come from a Latin American country, and you arrive in the United States, and you are surrounded predominantly by Latin American people, Latin American culture, the language, etc.
[02:17:36.764 --> 02:17:38.285]  Uh, you don't- Stay there, we gotta break.
[02:17:38.305 --> 02:17:38.865]  I wanna hear this.
[02:17:39.165 --> 02:17:39.626]  Stay there, sir.
[02:17:42.575 --> 02:17:51.644]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[02:17:51.884 --> 02:18:03.114]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:18:03.454 --> 02:18:08.279]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[02:18:08.499 --> 02:18:08.659]  I think?
[02:18:27.227 --> 02:18:28.488]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:18:48.627 --> 02:18:53.450]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:53.651 --> 02:18:56.392]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:56.453 --> 02:18:57.553]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:18:58.894 --> 02:19:03.497]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:04.418 --> 02:19:11.703]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:19:12.684 --> 02:19:15.746]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Buck and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[02:19:17.896 --> 02:19:21.338]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:19:22.319 --> 02:19:23.620]  Call for your copy today.
[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:26.061]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:27.102 --> 02:19:32.965]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:19:33.586 --> 02:19:33.726]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:33.746 --> 02:19:34.046]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:45.722]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer.
[02:19:46.202 --> 02:19:48.865]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[02:19:49.625 --> 02:19:50.767]  For a while, anyway.
[02:19:51.267 --> 02:19:54.430]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[02:19:55.050 --> 02:19:57.393]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[02:19:57.713 --> 02:20:01.196]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[02:20:01.556 --> 02:20:03.798]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[02:20:04.359 --> 02:20:05.080]  What's the name again?
[02:20:05.100 --> 02:20:06.461]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[02:20:06.861 --> 02:20:07.682]  It's CalX.
[02:20:07.982 --> 02:20:08.203]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[02:20:10.524 --> 02:20:12.185]  What makes Cal-X ointment so different?
[02:20:12.405 --> 02:20:20.748]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[02:20:21.749 --> 02:20:26.331]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[02:20:26.531 --> 02:20:35.654]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[02:20:36.355 --> 02:20:37.455]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[02:20:37.515 --> 02:20:38.175]  I'll be right back.
[02:20:38.436 --> 02:20:39.376]  I'm getting some Cal-X.
[02:20:42.288 --> 02:20:43.449]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD.
[02:20:43.469 --> 02:20:45.851]  I'm the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[02:20:45.971 --> 02:20:48.953]  Allicin, natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[02:20:49.013 --> 02:20:49.713]  is a real thing.
[02:20:49.773 --> 02:20:56.638]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[02:20:56.778 --> 02:21:02.062]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[02:21:02.142 --> 02:21:02.962]  We're good to go!
[02:21:29.033 --> 02:21:33.755]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[02:21:34.775 --> 02:21:40.738]  That number again, 888-212-8871 for the most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[02:21:48.969 --> 02:21:54.794]  We're talking to the head of NumbersUSA, and we're honored to have Roy back on with us.
[02:21:55.495 --> 02:21:59.098]  Website's NumbersUSA.com, links to it up on InfoWars.com.
[02:21:59.558 --> 02:22:07.265]  Roy, finishing up with the analysis, people you've talked to with the populations that are predominantly Latin American inside the U.S., please continue.
[02:22:07.945 --> 02:22:16.893]  Well, when these large populations of foreign-born people are living in areas, neighborhoods, communities where they
[02:22:17.751 --> 02:22:24.336]  There is no America to assimilate to, because maybe the only language they really hear most of the time is theirs.
[02:22:25.257 --> 02:22:26.678]  The culture they're in is theirs.
[02:22:27.399 --> 02:22:45.093]  So, it creates a sense of separateness, and then, when you add to it, their very presence, the presence of so many foreign workers, if keeping those kinds of jobs that they're in, at a very low pay, they look around, they become resentful, the society is not letting them become
[02:22:45.916 --> 02:22:51.561]  Really a part of the mainstream, which is really almost not possible for them to become part of the mainstream as long as you have high immigration.
[02:22:52.241 --> 02:23:04.551]  And then you have both leaders from their own people, but also from groups that are native-born people, radical leaders telling them how discriminated against, how unfair life is.
[02:23:05.312 --> 02:23:11.637]  And then you create the possibility of some pretty serious civil unrest.
[02:23:12.468 --> 02:23:15.109]  among these very large populations of poor people.
[02:23:15.690 --> 02:23:23.893]  And that's what the leftists in the country, that's their desire, is to import enough people from third-world countries.
[02:23:23.913 --> 02:23:24.574]  Well, exactly!
[02:23:24.594 --> 02:23:29.576]  They want to include that kind of third-world unrest where Marxism has a chance.
[02:23:29.796 --> 02:23:35.198]  Because they know Marxism will never take hold among the American people that are already here.
[02:23:35.398 --> 02:23:37.940]  Well, that's why the Ford Foundation, with $24 billion and others,
[02:23:39.100 --> 02:23:39.460]  Yes, we are.
[02:24:02.551 --> 02:24:05.332]  I wish these immigrant groups realized how they were being manipulated.
[02:24:05.392 --> 02:24:08.613]  I mean, we're talking about billions of people now that want to come here.
[02:24:08.653 --> 02:24:21.277]  Can you give folks the conservative projections one more time for where we're going, and then give them the projections you guys have done, or have you done those projections with the real numbers we've got on how bad it really is going to be?
[02:24:21.337 --> 02:24:29.640]  Yeah, well, according to the Census Bureau, if you take this massive new immigration flow that we've had since 1970, and if you look from here to 2050,
[02:24:32.518 --> 02:24:50.390]  About 98% of all the population growth from now until 2050, which they're saying is going to go from 300 million to 420 million, about 90% of that, 95% of it, is going to be due to new immigrants plus the descendants of all the immigrants who've come just recently or in the future.
[02:24:50.650 --> 02:24:53.492]  So basically, immigration is driving all the population growth.
[02:24:53.512 --> 02:25:01.097]  So that means almost 95 cents of every dollar that your community has to spend on anything
[02:25:02.021 --> 02:25:07.705]  Uh, to build anything new, to expand anything, is being caused by immigration policy.
[02:25:07.805 --> 02:25:13.289]  And because these workers make so little money, there's no way that they are able to pay for it.
[02:25:13.350 --> 02:25:19.594]  Therefore, the native-born Americans are paying higher taxes and getting more and more deteriorating quality.
[02:25:19.834 --> 02:25:22.336]  However, remember, that's $300 to $420 million.
[02:25:23.077 --> 02:25:25.518]  That's what will go from $300 to $420 million by the Census Bureau.
[02:25:25.538 --> 02:25:26.519]  Do me a favor, sir.
[02:25:26.559 --> 02:25:28.060]  Mr. Beck, back off your phone a little bit.
[02:25:28.140 --> 02:25:29.001]  I'm sorry about that.
[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:49.932]  But the reality is, is that if Congress does not pass very, very strict new laws against illegal immigration, if Congress does not reduce legal immigration at least a little bit, then we're actually headed to hit something much closer to $500 million, $500 million by 2050.
[02:25:52.799 --> 02:26:06.686]  And they're going to be mad because they're going to be living in Mexico City type or Calcutta type squalor and it's all going to be the fault of the tiny groups of blacks, whites, Hispanics, it doesn't matter, living in tiny walled compounds with private security guards.
[02:26:07.127 --> 02:26:11.149]  And we've got, and it's even worse than that because right now the U.S.
[02:26:11.169 --> 02:26:13.190]  Senate, President Bush,
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:24.006]  And the Democratic leadership of the Senate right now are working like crazy to pass their amnesty and a gigantic 40% increase in legal immigration.
[02:26:24.466 --> 02:26:31.231]  If they do that, we may be looking at close to $600 million by the middle of the century.
[02:26:32.051 --> 02:26:39.596]  They are intent on absolutely flooding our neighborhoods, our surrounding open space, with people from around the world.
[02:26:39.656 --> 02:26:40.216]  This will create
[02:26:40.618 --> 02:26:42.979]  We will drive American wages and working conditions.
[02:26:43.059 --> 02:26:57.345]  And then notice though, notice it's the mainline left saying, that's good, but then they have the other side of their mouth, they say the environment is in trouble, and then on the other side of their mouth they say, but we need to have Europeans stop breeding.
[02:26:58.366 --> 02:27:04.288]  Well, actually, the left, the environmental left will say that Europeans should stop having kids.
[02:27:04.669 --> 02:27:05.469]  I mean, it's interesting.
[02:27:05.856 --> 02:27:07.997]  You have to have two kids to replace yourself.
[02:27:08.557 --> 02:27:14.779]  And so it seems like for the most part, it would be reasonable to allow anybody to replace themselves.
[02:27:14.819 --> 02:27:22.442]  But the environmental left believes that white people should have only one child per family to make room for the third world.
[02:27:22.482 --> 02:27:23.082]  Stay there, sir.
[02:27:23.122 --> 02:27:23.902]  I know you're very busy.
[02:27:23.922 --> 02:27:27.523]  We'll do five more minutes with this and then we'll talk about how people can support your organization.
[02:27:27.543 --> 02:27:29.664]  We'll be right back with the head of Numbers USA.
[02:27:31.685 --> 02:27:32.625]  We're on the march.
[02:27:33.065 --> 02:27:34.586]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:35.564 --> 02:27:38.248]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:41.730 --> 02:27:45.331]  Want to know the secret to finding a shop that can keep your car running like new?
[02:27:45.531 --> 02:27:49.431]  Find the cleanest shop in town, where cleaning is top priority.
[02:27:49.571 --> 02:27:53.092]  Not talking about clean floors, but better shops have those too.
[02:27:53.472 --> 02:28:01.033]  I mean shops that have the best training, equipment, and chemistry to clean every air, fuel, and fluid system in your vehicle.
[02:28:01.313 --> 02:28:04.594]  Keep it clean and you don't have to keep replacing parts.
[02:28:05.014 --> 02:28:08.675]  Find your clean shop at bgfindashop.com.
[02:28:08.915 --> 02:28:10.635]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[02:28:11.736 --> 02:28:14.638]  What's better than a tiny tiger in your tank?
[02:28:14.658 --> 02:28:16.199]  A tornado under your hood!
[02:28:16.559 --> 02:28:22.203]  A tornado is an easy to install, maintenance-free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[02:28:22.524 --> 02:28:29.689]  I personally commissioned independent tests to verify results in six vehicles and all of them gained MPG with Tornado.
[02:28:29.829 --> 02:28:34.652]  With today's gas prices it makes sense to cage the gas saving power of a tornado.
[02:28:34.832 --> 02:28:40.036]  Visit TornadoAir.com or go to Pep Boys, Napa or AutoZone today!
[02:28:42.788 --> 02:28:46.550]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:54.253]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[02:28:54.693 --> 02:29:05.658]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[02:29:05.718 --> 02:29:06.178]  Central.
[02:29:06.538 --> 02:29:12.121]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[02:29:12.481 --> 02:29:18.384]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[02:29:18.865 --> 02:29:23.607]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[02:29:23.987 --> 02:29:28.790]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[02:29:29.230 --> 02:29:30.531]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[02:29:30.591 --> 02:29:31.011]  Central.
[02:29:31.591 --> 02:29:39.015]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetsmen.org.
[02:29:41.690 --> 02:29:45.734]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:45.955 --> 02:29:49.358]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:49.518 --> 02:29:53.242]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:53.262 --> 02:29:56.526]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:29:56.546 --> 02:30:01.951]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[02:30:02.452 --> 02:30:03.253]  We're good to go.
[02:30:19.085 --> 02:30:23.508]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:23.528 --> 02:30:24.969]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:25.129 --> 02:30:29.012]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:30:29.052 --> 02:30:29.872]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[02:30:51.952 --> 02:30:52.712]  It's real simple.
[02:30:52.752 --> 02:30:55.833]  The New World Order is going to orchestrate riots all over the country.
[02:30:56.793 --> 02:31:00.274]  They'll spin the riots at first to actually encourage the looting.
[02:31:00.294 --> 02:31:06.456]  Then they're going to unleash all their federally trained police in the Darth Vader outfits, like you saw in L.A.
[02:31:06.476 --> 02:31:11.577]  Then the middle class population will rally behind the police state as their savior.
[02:31:12.489 --> 02:31:20.315]  And then over time, they'll still break off and have an autonomous zone in the southwest into the east, southern areas of the United States.
[02:31:20.335 --> 02:31:21.876]  It's all part of the New World Order plan.
[02:31:22.417 --> 02:31:25.119]  Remember, the big banks control the left and they control the right.
[02:31:25.699 --> 02:31:27.040]  And that's who we face.
[02:31:27.981 --> 02:31:36.767]  But the gentleman we're talking to, Roy Beck, the head, the director of numbersusa.com, really has been one of the most effective people.
[02:31:36.807 --> 02:31:38.989]  He's gentlemanly, he's scholarly, he's focused.
[02:31:39.551 --> 02:31:53.435]  He first got started, as you know, with that committee with Barbara Jordan, who's a famous civil rights activist and black American, and she saw how serious this was just to the social services net.
[02:31:54.085 --> 02:31:59.471]  That's an old-line liberal who really thinks the government should be taking care of people and really sees it as helping.
[02:31:59.912 --> 02:32:00.673]  It's not meant to.
[02:32:00.713 --> 02:32:01.814]  It's meant to be bankrupted.
[02:32:02.335 --> 02:32:03.496]  The dollar's been bankrupted.
[02:32:03.536 --> 02:32:04.757]  We're already bankrupt.
[02:32:05.498 --> 02:32:09.843]  But completing what you were saying, sir, about where they project this is going.
[02:32:09.883 --> 02:32:11.044]  By the way, it's not just you.
[02:32:11.084 --> 02:32:12.987]  I saw you six, seven, eight, nine years ago.
[02:32:13.607 --> 02:32:24.268]  I guess about seven, eight years ago when I first started seeing some of your presentations at the PAC halls, when you go through all the actual numbers for hours, it's riveting, and it's up on the website, up on your organization's site.
[02:32:25.403 --> 02:32:38.613]  But the British 10-year Army Projection Report, the Ministry of Defense official report of what they believe is going to happen, and their reports have been very accurate in the past, say the exact same thing you're saying.
[02:32:39.114 --> 02:32:42.936]  They say the third world populations that have been let in are going to burn all of Europe and the U.S.
[02:32:42.956 --> 02:32:43.497]  to the ground.
[02:32:45.158 --> 02:32:47.900]  But I guess it's just unbelievable.
[02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:48.541]  Please continue.
[02:32:48.561 --> 02:32:54.345]  Well, I guess the one thing I want to say in our remaining time real quickly is that
[02:32:55.463 --> 02:33:03.710]  We have to, as American citizens, realize that it will be a disaster if we don't individually act.
[02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:20.464]  And that's the reason why, when we formed NumbersUSA, we put something online, we were one of the first ones to do this, to encourage people to do very easy faxing, free faxing of messages to members of Congress, and then eventually start doing phone calling and other things.
[02:33:20.884 --> 02:33:21.885]  It does make a difference.
[02:33:21.945 --> 02:33:24.567]  The reason why President Bush and the Democratic Party
[02:33:24.966 --> 02:33:35.273]  Have not been able to get their amnesty through in the last five years, even though they've tried like crazy to do it, is because people like your listeners have picked up a phone and made calls to Congress.
[02:33:35.293 --> 02:33:37.895]  It's because they've gotten on our website and sent these free faxes.
[02:33:38.675 --> 02:33:40.076]  And the people in Congress say that.
[02:33:40.096 --> 02:33:43.258]  They say, all of the elites are for the open borders.
[02:33:43.679 --> 02:33:50.443]  The heads of almost all the main religious denominations now are pushing for open borders.
[02:33:50.763 --> 02:33:54.746]  The AFL-CIO, the business community, big media,
[02:33:55.439 --> 02:33:55.739]  I don't
[02:34:14.301 --> 02:34:18.382]  We've got a long way to go before we actually get them to start improving the situation.
[02:34:18.962 --> 02:34:28.804]  And it's, you know, it's not just for these globalist bankers and industrialists who want to basically gain control themselves.
[02:34:29.144 --> 02:34:31.924]  So it'll be a government by the corporations, for the corporations.
[02:34:32.564 --> 02:34:41.006]  But it's also the Democratic Party is willing to sell out all of their principles for the fact that every year they get this big, huge net gain of Democratic voters.
[02:34:41.898 --> 02:34:49.621]  And so those two things, those two kinds of cynicism and corruption among the Republicans and the Democrats are what we, the American people, are going against.
[02:34:50.581 --> 02:35:00.385]  If we are going to remain to be we, the American people, who actually, the government belongs to us and responds to us, we don't have much time left.
[02:35:00.945 --> 02:35:03.546]  Because they know they can use immigration
[02:35:03.959 --> 02:35:08.621]  To basically do away with our sovereignty as people... Are you kidding?
[02:35:08.641 --> 02:35:11.162]  They're about to vote to outright ban guns in L.A.
[02:35:11.202 --> 02:35:14.343]  completely, and it's the illegal alien bloc that's going to let them do it.
[02:35:14.463 --> 02:35:16.764]  Yeah, it's from one step to the other.
[02:35:16.804 --> 02:35:23.727]  So we're in big trouble, but we've got to remind ourselves how much we've held off so far.
[02:35:23.747 --> 02:35:31.731]  I really, in a lot of ways, feel like I've been reading a lot of history of the American Revolution lately because, you know, during most of that war,
[02:35:33.164 --> 02:35:37.367]  It really looked like an impossible task for us to be independent.
[02:35:37.427 --> 02:35:46.272]  And right now, in the middle of this immigration fight, it almost looks impossible that we will come out of this as an independent, self-governing people.
[02:35:46.292 --> 02:35:52.256]  It sounds to me like you're pitching this pretty heavily.
[02:35:52.276 --> 02:35:54.898]  I mean, the whole idea of giving up our sovereignty.
[02:35:55.618 --> 02:35:59.540]  A lot of people think that sovereignty is just something that belongs to the government.
[02:35:59.601 --> 02:35:59.861]  No, no.
[02:35:59.981 --> 02:36:01.822]  Sovereignty is the sovereignty of the people.
[02:36:02.799 --> 02:36:15.823]  And this immigration issue is the one that the enemies of our democracy, who want to move us toward the global elites controlling things, it's their number one tool.
[02:36:15.903 --> 02:36:18.864]  Well, Roy, it's not just that the elites are doing this and they pull out all the
[02:36:19.747 --> 02:36:21.508]  You know, all the restraints to get it done.
[02:36:21.989 --> 02:36:31.595]  It's that if all these illegals were here and saying they wanted to be part of America in red, white, and blue, I would know that they couldn't be here and couldn't increase their numbers because of the economic reasons alone.
[02:36:31.975 --> 02:36:35.798]  But there is the added, we hate America, ha, ha, ha, you're going down thing.
[02:36:36.118 --> 02:36:37.719]  I mean, I actually do love America.
[02:36:37.739 --> 02:36:40.301]  I don't just stick a sticker on my car.
[02:36:40.321 --> 02:36:41.262]  I mean, that makes me mad.
[02:36:42.094 --> 02:36:42.714]  Yeah.
[02:36:43.074 --> 02:36:57.499]  I guess I, I mean, there's no, for the most part, I just don't focus myself too much on the illegal aliens in the sense that I feel like everything they do has been made possible by Americans who are selling us out.
[02:36:57.539 --> 02:37:03.801]  And so that's, you know, that happens to be my primary focus is to go after the Americans that are selling the rest of us down the drain.
[02:37:04.801 --> 02:37:07.542]  It's as bad as any of these illegal aliens happen to be.
[02:37:08.335 --> 02:37:14.058]  In terms of their approach to America, it's been American citizens who have actually encouraged them to behave that way.
[02:37:15.039 --> 02:37:21.122]  No, I know, because they want to be kingpins, you know, kind of barrio bosses over all these poor folks.
[02:37:21.422 --> 02:37:28.826]  Yeah, they might want to consider the history of people like Trotsky and some of the others who ushered in revolutions and then ended up with their heads in the block.
[02:37:29.166 --> 02:37:34.950]  But yes, that's right, they think they're all for all of this because they think they're going to be the ones who are going to be the rulers.
[02:37:35.010 --> 02:37:36.530]  Now, who actually ends up being the ruler?
[02:37:36.831 --> 02:37:37.411]  Who can guess?
[02:37:38.835 --> 02:37:47.837]  Well, to take America and just tear it into pieces in front of everybody's eyes, or to pop it like a wet paper bag in front of everybody's face, just makes my blood boil.
[02:37:47.857 --> 02:37:50.438]  I hope everybody will go to your website, get the videos that are there.
[02:37:50.458 --> 02:37:55.659]  And find out, we keep a dossier on every single member of Congress.
[02:37:55.839 --> 02:38:01.140]  Every single immigration action they've ever taken is on that website, and then we grade them.
[02:38:01.180 --> 02:38:04.681]  So that's really important to know who are the true villains,
[02:38:05.023 --> 02:38:09.648]  And who are the people that are standing up for us, and who are the wishy-washy ones that go both ways?
[02:38:10.508 --> 02:38:22.740]  All sides can learn from Roy Beck, Businessweek, Always Balanced, Never Shrugged, Washington Post, Compassionate, Profoundly Moral, Louisville Courier-Journal, and it just goes on and on.
[02:38:24.382 --> 02:38:28.506]  And even the CFR had to say, no one has made a better case for immediate
[02:38:29.395 --> 02:38:30.976]  Immigration reductions.
[02:38:31.196 --> 02:38:33.078]  A case for immigration reductions.
[02:38:34.438 --> 02:38:35.799]  Virtually irrefutable.
[02:38:35.859 --> 02:38:36.780]  The New York Post.
[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:38.601]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:38:38.681 --> 02:38:44.505]  Cornell University, a populace reminiscent of classic investigative writers such as Upton Sinclair.
[02:38:44.725 --> 02:38:47.007]  We've got to have you back up for a full hour sometime, sir.
[02:38:47.027 --> 02:38:48.428]  I appreciate you coming on.
[02:38:48.868 --> 02:38:49.829]  Well, thanks for your interest.
[02:38:50.529 --> 02:38:50.829]  You bet.
[02:38:50.869 --> 02:38:51.930]  God bless and take care.
[02:38:52.450 --> 02:38:53.131]  Look, it's simple.
[02:38:55.286 --> 02:38:58.128]  And Hispanics will email me and say, why is it always about Hispanics and Hispanics?
[02:38:58.208 --> 02:39:04.854]  Well, over 80% of the illegal aliens in this country are Hispanic and the majority are from Mexico.
[02:39:06.455 --> 02:39:20.567]  And my wife, you know, is completely freaked out because she speaks Spanish and she listens to the Mexican radio and she hears it because she lived like four or five years in Spain.
[02:39:20.908 --> 02:39:22.269]  She speaks fluent Spanish.
[02:39:23.391 --> 02:39:24.992]  And she's the one freaking out now.
[02:39:25.012 --> 02:39:28.033]  I remember like six, seven years ago, she was aware of stuff, but not really that.
[02:39:28.553 --> 02:39:30.594]  She's like, oh my God, did you read that on the side of that store?
[02:39:31.115 --> 02:39:32.095]  It says, we're taking over.
[02:39:32.675 --> 02:39:34.056]  Oh my gosh, do you hear that radio station?
[02:39:34.136 --> 02:39:36.597]  It says, revolutionaries, we're taking over.
[02:39:36.657 --> 02:39:39.198]  I mean, it's just, it's everywhere.
[02:39:40.299 --> 02:39:45.141]  And 600 and something signs in LA saying LA is now Mexico, ha ha ha.
[02:39:49.128 --> 02:39:53.109]  I mean, and you expect us to just sit here and go, oh, this is wonderful!
[02:39:53.469 --> 02:39:54.270]  Oh, yes!
[02:39:54.970 --> 02:39:56.090]  How nice!
[02:39:57.671 --> 02:39:58.411]  How nice!
[02:40:00.771 --> 02:40:05.513]  And the incredible thing is, it's destroying everybody's future, unless you're a few elitists controlling it.
[02:40:06.473 --> 02:40:08.174]  So he's right, we've got to focus on the government.
[02:40:08.594 --> 02:40:16.376]  And when you've got the leaders of the Baptists, the leaders of the Catholics, the leaders of all the major denominations, saying it's a holy sacrament to have open borders,
[02:40:17.365 --> 02:40:20.766]  When you've got the leaders of both parties saying they want it.
[02:40:21.346 --> 02:40:25.027]  When you've got academia, it's because they're all bought and paid for, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:25.487 --> 02:40:32.829]  Then those stage shows where they go, we're going to build a fence, then it might get built, or we'll put a few troops down there, and then they really don't have a few photo ops.
[02:40:33.529 --> 02:40:36.890]  I mean, they're trying to kill this country as fast as they can.
[02:40:38.459 --> 02:40:45.183]  And again, they tell Latin Americans, look at all the enslavement you've had, look at all the things you've been through, look at all the things you've gone through.
[02:40:45.584 --> 02:40:48.646]  It's all the fault of the Americans.
[02:40:48.906 --> 02:40:49.426]  It's them.
[02:40:49.466 --> 02:40:54.449]  And they get here, and they're used as an under-slave class, basically, like Rome.
[02:40:55.150 --> 02:40:58.112]  And then they get even more mad, which is what the government wants.
[02:40:58.132 --> 02:40:59.412]  It's problem, reaction, solution.
[02:40:59.652 --> 02:41:04.796]  They bring in the problem and they exacerbate it and export an even bigger problem into the mix.
[02:41:07.046 --> 02:41:13.328]  When I want all the Latin Americans to know, I know bad things have been done to you down there, and bad dictators have been put in over you.
[02:41:13.708 --> 02:41:16.869]  And I know it's been advertised to you that socialism is what's going to free you.
[02:41:17.490 --> 02:41:18.550]  That is not the case.
[02:41:18.590 --> 02:41:20.631]  The big banks are behind that too to consolidate.
[02:41:21.631 --> 02:41:26.212]  And there's nowhere to run once America falls.
[02:41:28.353 --> 02:41:33.335]  It'd be like basically dancing on your own grave to get all into
[02:41:34.375 --> 02:41:38.436]  Get all hyped up and all arrogant about it, and I'm just tired of the celebrations about the death of my country.
[02:41:39.576 --> 02:41:46.058]  Because what is being replaced with is not a free system, and if you love your children, you better join us.
[02:41:46.198 --> 02:41:47.198]  I mean, it's real simple.
[02:41:48.178 --> 02:41:50.298]  It's real simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:51.319 --> 02:41:55.259]  Okay, I mean, the New World Order is for an open border, okay?
[02:41:55.340 --> 02:42:00.241]  And they're doing a thousand other evil things, but oh, this thing they're doing is good.
[02:42:00.921 --> 02:42:02.081]  No, it's not good.
[02:42:04.085 --> 02:42:04.385]  Okay.
[02:42:06.346 --> 02:42:10.507]  I'm going to play this because I said I'd get to it, but I won't have time to properly comment on it.
[02:42:11.148 --> 02:42:14.209]  I'll play it, comment some, and then get more into it when I start the show tomorrow.
[02:42:14.789 --> 02:42:16.089]  But here is a Fox News piece.
[02:42:16.109 --> 02:42:18.290]  There's actually two of these, but here's the longest one.
[02:42:19.490 --> 02:42:22.492]  This aired about a month after 9-11.
[02:42:23.332 --> 02:42:28.574]  We covered it here, and this is where you get the stories of Israel being behind the attacks.
[02:42:29.214 --> 02:42:30.594]  So let's go ahead and roll this.
[02:42:30.754 --> 02:42:32.135]  This is Fox News.
[02:42:33.035 --> 02:42:34.376]  Okay, here it is.
[02:42:35.296 --> 02:42:41.259]  It has been more than 16 years since a civilian working for the Navy was charged with passing secrets to Israel.
[02:42:41.759 --> 02:42:46.301]  Jonathan Pollard pled guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage and is serving a life sentence.
[02:42:46.842 --> 02:42:52.124]  At first, Israeli leaders claimed Pollard was part of a rogue operation, but later took responsibility for his work.
[02:42:52.584 --> 02:42:54.185]  Now Fox News has learned some U.S.
[02:42:54.225 --> 02:42:59.908]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:43:00.583 --> 02:43:03.626]  Who may have known things they didn't tell us before September 11th.
[02:43:04.006 --> 02:43:08.250]  Fox News correspondent Carl Cameron has details in the first of a four-part series.
[02:43:09.677 --> 02:43:17.783]  Since September 11th, more than 60 Israelis have been arrested or detained, either under the new Patriot anti-terrorism law or for immigration violations.
[02:43:18.284 --> 02:43:31.514]  A handful of active Israeli military were among those detained, according to investigators, who say some of the detainees also failed polygraph questions when asked about alleged surveillance activities against and in the United States.
[02:43:32.134 --> 02:43:42.661]  There is no indication that the Israelis were involved in the 9-11 attacks, but investigators suspect that the Israelis may have gathered intelligence about the attacks in advance, and not shared it.
[02:43:43.242 --> 02:43:53.388]  A highly placed investigator said there are quote, tie-ins, but when asked for details, he flatly refused to describe them, saying quote, evidence linking these Israelis to 9-11 is classified.
[02:43:53.468 --> 02:43:55.790]  I cannot tell you about evidence that has been gathered.
[02:43:56.110 --> 02:43:57.471]  It's classified information.
[02:43:58.061 --> 02:44:10.303]  Fox News has learned that one group of Israelis spotted in North Carolina recently is suspected of keeping an apartment in California to spy on a group of Arabs who the United States is also investigating for links to terrorism.
[02:44:10.971 --> 02:44:26.884]  Numerous classified documents obtained by Fox News indicate that even prior to September 11th, as many as 140 other Israelis had been detained or arrested in a secretive and sprawling investigation into suspected espionage by Israelis in the United States.
[02:44:27.465 --> 02:44:33.309]  Investigators from numerous government agencies are part of a working group that's been compiling evidence since the mid-90s.
[02:44:34.390 --> 02:44:43.373]  These documents detail hundreds of incidents in cities and towns across the country that investigators say, quote, may well be an organized intelligence gathering activity.
[02:44:43.893 --> 02:44:51.115]  The first part of the investigation focuses on Israelis who say they are art students from the University of Jerusalem and Bezalel Academy.
[02:44:51.495 --> 02:44:53.216]  They repeatedly made contact with U.S.
[02:44:53.276 --> 02:44:57.917]  government personnel, the report says, by saying they wanted to sell cheap art or handiwork.
[02:44:58.610 --> 02:45:11.936]  Documents say they, quote, targeted and penetrated military bases, the DEA, FBI, and dozens of other government facilities, and even secret offices and unlisted private homes of law enforcement and intelligence personnel.
[02:45:12.517 --> 02:45:21.461]  The majority of those questioned, quote, stated they served in military intelligence, electronic surveillance intercept, and or explosive ordnance units.
[02:45:23.311 --> 02:45:33.543]  Another part of the investigation has resulted in the detention and arrests of dozens of Israelis at American mall kiosks, where they've been selling toys called Puzzle Car and Zoomcopter.
[02:45:35.072 --> 02:45:36.733]  Investigators suspect a front.
[02:45:37.134 --> 02:45:42.958]  Shortly after the New York Times and Washington Post reported the Israeli detentions last month, the carts began vanishing.
[02:45:43.478 --> 02:45:49.602]  Zoomcopter's webpage says, we are aware of the situation caused by thousands of mall carts being closed at the last minute.
[02:45:49.962 --> 02:45:53.105]  This in no way reflects the quality of the toy or its saleability.
[02:45:53.385 --> 02:45:55.827]  The problem lies in the operator's business policies.
[02:45:56.407 --> 02:45:59.149]  Why would Israelis spy in and on the U.S.? ?
[02:45:59.689 --> 02:46:05.474]  A General Accounting Office investigation referred to Israel as Country A and said, quote, According to a U.S.
[02:46:05.534 --> 02:46:11.259]  intelligence agency, the government of Country A conducts the most aggressive espionage operation against the U.S.
[02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:12.420]  of any U.S.
[02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:12.861]  ally.
[02:46:13.241 --> 02:46:17.545]  A defense intelligence report said Israel has a voracious appetite for information and, quote,
[02:46:17.945 --> 02:46:24.110]  The Israelis are motivated by strong survival instincts which dictate every facet of their political and economic policies.
[02:46:24.530 --> 02:46:28.573]  It aggressively collects military and industrial technology and the U.S.
[02:46:28.633 --> 02:46:30.134]  is a high-priority target.
[02:46:30.655 --> 02:46:37.880]  The document concludes, quote, Israel possesses the resources and technical capability to achieve its collection objectives.
[02:46:38.837 --> 02:46:48.065]  A spokesman for the Israeli Embassy here in Washington issued a categorical denial saying any suggestion that Israelis are spying in or on the U.S.
[02:46:48.145 --> 02:46:49.887]  is simply not true.
[02:46:50.468 --> 02:46:54.311]  There are other things to consider and in the days ahead we will take a look at the U.S.
[02:46:54.411 --> 02:47:03.839]  phone system and law enforcement's methods for wiretaps and an investigation into the possibility that both have been compromised by our friends and allies overseas.
[02:47:04.961 --> 02:47:10.044]  Carl, what about this question of advanced knowledge of what was going to happen on 9-11?
[02:47:10.684 --> 02:47:14.706]  How clear are investigators that some Israeli agents may have known something?
[02:47:14.946 --> 02:47:19.329]  Well, it's very explosive information, obviously, and there's a great deal of evidence that they say they have collected.
[02:47:19.409 --> 02:47:20.969]  None of it necessarily conclusive.
[02:47:21.370 --> 02:47:23.151]  It's more when they put it all together.
[02:47:23.631 --> 02:47:26.452]  A bigger question, they say, is how could they not have known?
[02:47:26.833 --> 02:47:28.073]  Almost a direct quote.
[02:47:28.493 --> 02:47:31.495]  And this going to the fact that they were spying on some Arabs, right?
[02:47:31.595 --> 02:47:31.895]  Correct.
[02:47:32.095 --> 02:47:32.616]  All right, Carl.
[02:47:32.636 --> 02:47:33.196]  Thanks very much.
[02:47:34.085 --> 02:47:43.534]  Yeah, when you put it all together, when you put it all together, I have thought about this for five and a half, almost six years.
[02:47:45.295 --> 02:47:52.181]  I've looked at it, I've studied it, and I rarely have something that's a conundrum or a paradox.
[02:47:52.602 --> 02:47:55.284]  As I mentioned earlier with the thing with the illegal aliens, it's similar.
[02:47:56.565 --> 02:47:57.947]  I rarely have a paradox.
[02:47:59.381 --> 02:48:07.903]  Because, I mean, we've always reported and covered the fact that Israel has staged many terror attacks on itself and others as a pretext to push their aims.
[02:48:08.123 --> 02:48:10.763]  We've never debated that, and other people have claimed that we haven't.
[02:48:11.184 --> 02:48:12.304]  That, of course, is a fraud.
[02:48:14.304 --> 02:48:17.125]  When we get back, I'll try to go through this as best I can.
[02:48:17.165 --> 02:48:19.545]  Tomorrow, I'm going to probably do 30 minutes on it.
[02:48:19.565 --> 02:48:27.607]  Because just listening to that piece, I just wrote, like, ten lines of notes I wanted to comment on, and there's no way to do it all.
[02:48:29.717 --> 02:48:34.941]  But, um... The phone system thing alone, we could spend an hour on.
[02:48:34.961 --> 02:48:38.883]  Oh yeah, the national caller ID is run by Israel.
[02:48:38.943 --> 02:48:39.604]  You didn't know that?
[02:48:39.624 --> 02:48:48.069]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:48.409 --> 02:48:50.351]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:50.711 --> 02:48:58.336]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:59.051 --> 02:49:06.115]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:06.495 --> 02:49:17.921]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:18.221 --> 02:49:21.823]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:22.183 --> 02:49:24.124]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:24.464 --> 02:49:28.306]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:43.452 --> 02:50:47.154]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:50:47.474 --> 02:50:56.417]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:50:56.577 --> 02:51:01.439]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:01.659 --> 02:51:10.684]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[02:51:51.446 --> 02:51:57.930]  I shouldn't even attempt to tackle this subject in four minutes, four and a half minutes, but I'll try.
[02:51:57.950 --> 02:52:12.200]  Number one, I want to say I detest anti-Semites and their religion of just repeating the word Jew over and over again.
[02:52:13.744 --> 02:52:17.365]  Like it does something to the New World Order, like it's having some effect.
[02:52:17.385 --> 02:52:27.089]  When actual Zionist documents say they want to create anti-Semitism, they love it because it makes Jews go and serve them so they can feed on them and use them and control Jews.
[02:52:28.809 --> 02:52:32.511]  That's A. B, I detest Zionism.
[02:52:32.531 --> 02:52:38.213]  It's a virulent form of racism and control and an excuse to dominate and usurp people.
[02:52:39.873 --> 02:52:40.994]  So, you know, again, a paradox.
[02:52:42.316 --> 02:52:45.757]  I don't like the people that hate Jews, and I don't like the Zionists.
[02:52:47.098 --> 02:52:50.179]  And I also know the anti-Zionists, they'll make up a lot of stuff.
[02:52:50.339 --> 02:52:52.220]  Everybody's really a Jew who isn't.
[02:52:53.140 --> 02:53:08.387]  You know, I am, and George Bush is, and the Queen of England is, and I say something like, the Rothschilds are married in with the Nordic Royals, and then I'm covering up, no, they're Jews, and I never said they weren't part Jewish.
[02:53:08.427 --> 02:53:11.928]  My point is, it's an indistinguishable, weird amalgamation.
[02:53:14.244 --> 02:53:16.506]  So there's a lot of that stuff going on, but it isn't about me.
[02:53:16.666 --> 02:53:22.070]  The only reason I get upset sometimes is because I genuinely am trying to tell you what I really think.
[02:53:22.590 --> 02:53:28.014]  I genuinely really try to put forward the truth, as close to the truth as I can find it.
[02:53:28.915 --> 02:53:30.256]  I don't claim to have all the answers.
[02:53:31.597 --> 02:53:42.365]  And yes, Israelis weren't just caught jumping up and down dancing in the moving company, and we brought you the news about Israelis at that cemetery talking about the towers will be knocked down in September and then they'll learn.
[02:53:43.636 --> 02:53:47.599]  And we've talked about Israel and the USS Liberty and Israel blowing up hotels.
[02:53:47.760 --> 02:53:49.881]  I make films about it!
[02:53:52.704 --> 02:53:59.289]  And then clearly those that are controlled by the Zionists and others come out and attack me because they don't want you to legitimately attack their whole paradigm.
[02:53:59.970 --> 02:54:03.693]  They want you to just mindlessly do it from a white supremacist perspective.
[02:54:04.714 --> 02:54:10.579]  But I do not believe that even the Zionists from the planet, I believe they're a big part of it, it's evil people
[02:54:11.871 --> 02:54:16.134]  And see, I don't subscribe to the idea that evil only meets in the heart of Jews.
[02:54:17.895 --> 02:54:19.176]  Evil goes on all over the place.
[02:54:19.196 --> 02:54:21.178]  It was going on 5,000 years ago in China.
[02:54:21.198 --> 02:54:24.380]  It was going on 3,000 years ago in ancient Germania.
[02:54:25.501 --> 02:54:31.285]  And so that's also a cop-out, you know, to say one group's the devil's seed, and many sides like to do that.
[02:54:31.325 --> 02:54:36.068]  The white supremacists do that, and the racist Jews do that, and I frankly am sick of that too.
[02:54:37.552 --> 02:54:51.762]  But on the question of 9-11 and was Israel involved, well that would be like if I went and robbed a bank, that would be like saying was my right hand involved or was my eyes involved.
[02:54:52.323 --> 02:55:00.108]  Yes, and I'm not saying that Israel wasn't involved, I'm saying they didn't run the whole operation or the attacks, but you're just as guilty.
[02:55:00.409 --> 02:55:02.070]  Like if five guys go in and rob a bank,
[02:55:02.822 --> 02:55:04.924]  And I'm saying five guys did it, and people go, No!
[02:55:05.024 --> 02:55:05.904]  It's one guy!
[02:55:06.225 --> 02:55:07.105]  It's one guy!
[02:55:07.846 --> 02:55:10.988]  Don't you try to... Don't you try to get the responsibility off him!
[02:55:11.008 --> 02:55:11.669]  And I go, No, no, no.
[02:55:11.689 --> 02:55:13.050]  He came in and loaded bags of money.
[02:55:13.370 --> 02:55:14.431]  He pointed guns, too.
[02:55:14.451 --> 02:55:17.233]  I mean, Israel, British intelligence, U.S.
[02:55:17.273 --> 02:55:18.734]  intelligence are the same thing.
[02:55:20.235 --> 02:55:21.416]  But NORAD was involved.
[02:55:21.436 --> 02:55:22.577]  The Pentagon was involved.
[02:55:22.617 --> 02:55:23.537]  Cheney was involved.
[02:55:23.998 --> 02:55:25.279]  Israel was clearly involved.
[02:55:26.740 --> 02:55:29.482]  A bunch of... The Pakistanis were involved in a support role.
[02:55:30.356 --> 02:55:32.560]  It just shows you government's wicked and out of control.
[02:55:32.900 --> 02:55:38.909]  See, if you effectively attack Israel on the fact that they just got a mafia government, then we could stop it.
[02:55:39.390 --> 02:55:41.333]  But if you make it a debate about Jews...
[02:55:42.993 --> 02:55:44.115]  The New World Order wins.
[02:55:44.315 --> 02:55:48.139]  But see, that's why they desperately want to make it about Jews.
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:54.948]  Because if they can make the whole thing about Jews, then it won't be okay for Bruce Willis to go public against the New World Order.
[02:55:55.388 --> 02:55:56.770]  Then it won't be popular.
[02:55:56.790 --> 02:55:58.532]  Then it won't be something we can win.
[02:55:59.053 --> 02:56:00.434]  See, I just want to defeat the New World Order.
[02:56:00.715 --> 02:56:02.497]  Whoever's pulling the strings is fine and dandy.
[02:56:03.172 --> 02:56:04.653]  I want to stop their operations.
[02:56:05.394 --> 02:56:07.115]  Notice those that only do is bash Jews?
[02:56:07.635 --> 02:56:09.477]  They never talk about any other issues either.
[02:56:09.777 --> 02:56:11.798]  Or never tell you to go get involved as an activist.
[02:56:12.279 --> 02:56:13.019]  We're here to win.
[02:56:13.479 --> 02:56:15.321]  Go get the Bruce Willis story on Present Planet.
[02:56:15.401 --> 02:56:15.941]  It's huge.
[02:56:15.981 --> 02:56:16.882]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:56:17.122 --> 02:56:17.983]  He's gone public.
[02:56:18.103 --> 02:56:18.883]  God bless you all.
