[00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.733]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio interview like no other.
[00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:10.734]  Strap yourselves in and hold on.
[00:00:11.735 --> 00:00:13.076]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:16.337]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:17.698 --> 00:00:19.259]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:22.480]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:26.222]  Call Alex now toll free at 877
[00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:28.059]  590-5525.
[00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:36.527]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.592]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:41.713 --> 00:00:42.914]  It is July 1st, 2007.
[00:00:42.994 --> 00:00:47.138]  We're gonna be live here for the next two hours, roughly.
[00:00:47.662 --> 00:00:59.845]  We're going to have open phones as well at 877-590-5525, or if you're listening to where this broadcast originates from, off our mothership home station, KLBJ-590, 8360-590.
[00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:07.187]  I want to thank all the AM and FM affiliates that do pick up the show.
[00:01:07.927 --> 00:01:09.828]  The new station's turning us on every few weeks.
[00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:13.489]  In fact, quite a few inquiries just this week about picking up the show.
[00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:24.253]  As it grows, been doing it now for about, what, six months syndicated and been here almost a year total now doing this Sunday radio show from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:01:24.693 --> 00:01:32.177]  Central Standard Time, I guess five days a week, doing a syndicated radio show since 1998 is not enough for me.
[00:01:32.237 --> 00:01:39.940]  Weekdays, I am here on Sundays because so much happens over the weekend and it is a news broadcast, it is a broadcast
[00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:48.815]  Dedicated to exposing corruption and the powerful globalist forces attempting to really end the United States as we know it.
[00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.616]  And it's not just here in the U.S.
[00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:53.457]  They are setting up tyranny all over the planet.
[00:01:54.718 --> 00:01:57.419]  So again, thank you for joining us, my friends.
[00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.781]  We will be going to your calls a little bit later in this hour.
[00:02:00.941 --> 00:02:05.443]  Obviously, we'll be talking about the new terror threat in the United Kingdom.
[00:02:06.404 --> 00:02:07.865]  We've got two
[00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:13.448]  Failed firebombings is how they could properly be termed.
[00:02:13.468 --> 00:02:18.131]  I don't want to give the scaremonger media, who's calling it a fiery holocaust, the proper term.
[00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:24.656]  They'd really love to fearmonger with that, but I guess the boys at the CIA haven't figured out yet that they can call this firebombings.
[00:02:25.516 --> 00:02:36.564]  But two failed firebombings, thanks to the bravery of the constabulary in and around London, and of course one successful attack, clearly an attack,
[00:02:37.336 --> 00:02:39.779]  Up in Glasgow, Scotland, on an airport.
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.743]  We'll be going over that today.
[00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:46.067]  What's being termed as a fiery holocaust.
[00:02:46.387 --> 00:02:54.197]  No one died, but Fox News in particular, you would think that the sun had exploded and the earth was destroyed yesterday.
[00:02:55.289 --> 00:03:02.631]  But, nevertheless, an image of a burning car certainly will get a lot of gas mileage towards butchering what's left of British national sovereignty.
[00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:07.912]  And we'll go into what's really behind all of this and the past history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:03:07.932 --> 00:03:18.075]  I think I will surprise some people by telling you that just looking at this, studying this the last two days, I tend to think this is actually real terrorism.
[00:03:19.035 --> 00:03:23.916]  I have to say that right now, this is prop- Now, again, we're not sure about that.
[00:03:25.565 --> 00:03:28.147]  But I'd have to say I'm more than fifty percent sure.
[00:03:29.148 --> 00:03:35.073]  I'm leaning towards this being real, homegrown, Muslim terrorists.
[00:03:36.514 --> 00:03:40.177]  But we will go over that today and discuss it.
[00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:44.941]  There is no doubt, though, that the government of the U.S.
[00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:52.527]  and the government of England, that is the private corporations owned by private banks that call themselves the government, are engaging in mass terror
[00:03:53.452 --> 00:04:01.976]  That is terrorizing the public into basically convulsing in fear and begging to have their liberties and freedoms taken.
[00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:09.018]  So we'll break down the real definition of terrorism and who is really engaging in classical fear-mongering.
[00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:19.503]  We'll be going over that because we have international statistics and federal statistics and depending on which ones you look at, you're between 300
[00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:29.326]  And 50 and 600 times more likely to die in an automobile accident, depending on which country you live in, here in the U.S.
[00:04:29.366 --> 00:04:32.708]  it's over 400, than to die by terrorist.
[00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.910]  You are over 200 times more likely to die by grounding.
[00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:38.112]  These are unnatural forms of death.
[00:04:39.472 --> 00:04:42.734]  But it doesn't matter, we don't see everyone running around, hyperventilating in fear.
[00:04:42.754 --> 00:04:46.697]  I was driving around the governor's mansion Friday night,
[00:04:47.982 --> 00:05:01.071]  Getting video shots for a film I'm making about, well, a section of the film, a few minutes, is about Perry going to Bilderberg a few weeks ago, criminally, violating the Logan Act, federal law, going to an international meeting to set policy with private interest.
[00:05:01.131 --> 00:05:06.975]  That is illegal unless you have a presidential, state, department, or congressional letter of authorization to do so.
[00:05:07.756 --> 00:05:15.341]  And I'm just driving around twice, we're in a red Mustang convertible that one of my employees has, we're videotaping out the back, it's clear as day what we're doing,
[00:05:15.962 --> 00:05:18.323]  State police run out into the middle of the road!
[00:05:18.863 --> 00:05:19.783]  Thank God!
[00:05:20.704 --> 00:05:23.245]  We saw this guy, because I could see it.
[00:05:23.285 --> 00:05:27.867]  It had been on the news we were Al-Qaeda trying to... Who knew Alex Jones was Al-Qaeda?
[00:05:28.447 --> 00:05:37.250]  And trying to fight our valiant state police, but the guy ran out in the middle of the street in front of us, we stopped, and then he asked for our papers, we showed it to him, but of course it was due to the...
[00:05:40.143 --> 00:05:46.065]  Oh, Alex Jones, and then some Austin cops rushed up and they didn't even say anything to us, they just laughed and got back and drove off.
[00:05:46.085 --> 00:05:50.867]  The heightened security, deadly, deadly al-Qaeda!
[00:05:52.247 --> 00:05:54.908]  But we will go over that for you.
[00:05:55.848 --> 00:06:01.090]  It's much more cinematic to get some rolling shots of the Governor's Mansion and then roll past with the Capitol in the background.
[00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.292]  And that, again, they must have thought our Sony video cameras were plutonium beams or
[00:06:08.038 --> 00:06:08.478]  Who knows?
[00:06:08.518 --> 00:06:09.920]  Maybe kryptonite cannons.
[00:06:11.501 --> 00:06:11.901]  I don't know.
[00:06:12.902 --> 00:06:17.145]  Some type of super laser weapon or something.
[00:06:17.165 --> 00:06:18.466]  You shouldn't worry about the border.
[00:06:18.867 --> 00:06:20.988]  Only two miles of border fence has been built.
[00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.312]  Get up on TV and claim they built thousands of miles of it.
[00:06:27.173 --> 00:06:28.454]  You ought to really worry about that.
[00:06:28.494 --> 00:06:29.595]  Or the open northern border.
[00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:31.476]  Really worried about all these terrorists.
[00:06:31.496 --> 00:06:32.677]  But again, they're not really worried.
[00:06:32.697 --> 00:06:36.220]  They just use that to fearmonger the police and the setting up a police state.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.221]  Oh, the cops are afraid!
[00:06:38.028 --> 00:06:40.550]  But again, that's all part of the brainwashing.
[00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.471]  So we'll go over that.
[00:06:42.512 --> 00:06:44.553]  Also, in the second hour, I want to get into chemtrails.
[00:06:46.594 --> 00:06:52.779]  NBC News did a report on chemtrails over California, and the broadcast basically said they were real.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.581]  This is a very delicate subject.
[00:06:55.921 --> 00:07:04.948]  You've got a lot of schizophrenics, a lot of crazy people, who think that the moon is following them and the sun is following them.
[00:07:05.911 --> 00:07:17.099]  And that there are leprechauns basically in their clothes hamper in the bathroom, you know, with red glowing eyes at 3 a.m., trying to eat them by way of their feet sticking out from under the covers.
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:24.585]  We've got people who think that any condensation trail is a nerve gas affluent to kill everyone.
[00:07:26.086 --> 00:07:31.950]  So they give everybody a bad name that actually looks at the fact that until the mid-1990s, jet trails didn't form
[00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:34.239]  Any lower than 20,000 feet.
[00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:37.260]  They did it normally in the winter, and they were only up there for a few minutes.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.260]  I have seen trails at 5,000 feet.
[00:07:39.901 --> 00:07:41.641]  I have seen trails that are there four hours later.
[00:07:42.001 --> 00:07:53.543]  I've seen them form cloud banks, and something's going on with the atmosphere, and now the Pentagon, the federal government, and even government textbooks admit they've got some program, secret program going on, altering our climate.
[00:07:54.404 --> 00:08:00.185]  And we've got one of these government climatologists on tape basically admitting this, and
[00:08:01.263 --> 00:08:12.306]  I talked to the father of weather weapons, Ben Livingston, last year, after we talked to him at broken papers around the country, including the Associated Press, that they had just declassified, so he was willing to talk about it at that time.
[00:08:12.346 --> 00:08:15.947]  No one paid attention to the fact that it had been declassified until he went public about it.
[00:08:16.327 --> 00:08:21.429]  About weather weapons that are being employed around the world, the question is, are they being employed here?
[00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:26.130]  So I'll probably spend a segment on that and play a five-minute clip from NBC for purposes of comments.
[00:08:26.954 --> 00:08:28.075]  Analyze that.
[00:08:28.515 --> 00:08:32.877]  That is coming up in the latter half of the next hour.
[00:08:32.897 --> 00:08:36.559]  I will spend some time on that.
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:42.803]  Also, in the next hour, I want to get into famous quotes of the New World Order.
[00:08:42.863 --> 00:08:48.806]  Now, there are so many thousands of these, but I'm only going to read 10 or 15, depending on time allows.
[00:08:49.326 --> 00:08:53.989]  These are from published works of some of the most powerful people in the world.
[00:08:54.748 --> 00:09:01.912]  Saying that they're setting up a world government, saying that they want to take your liberties and freedoms, and saying they'll use terrorism to get it done.
[00:09:03.393 --> 00:09:11.697]  So this is pretty darn important, and we will go over this coming up in the next hour.
[00:09:12.037 --> 00:09:17.340]  I do want to break, and then come back and get into the Scotland and London Terror Alert.
[00:09:18.411 --> 00:09:24.116]  What, just a month ago the Fed said it looked for airports to be bombed, truck bombs, car bombs in the U.S.
[00:09:24.456 --> 00:09:29.401]  Then they busted some non-Al Qaeda affiliated group that wanted to blow up JFK.
[00:09:30.101 --> 00:09:31.202]  Turned out that was a fraud.
[00:09:31.823 --> 00:09:33.004]  But we'll go over it.
[00:09:34.765 --> 00:09:42.792]  And then we will get into the attacks on free speech here in the country, talk radio, cameras on street corners, everything.
[00:09:43.653 --> 00:09:45.015]  Big show, lined up for you.
[00:09:45.035 --> 00:09:46.177]  A lot of important information.
[00:09:46.417 --> 00:09:50.263]  With the Fourth of July coming up in just three days, we need to remember what made this country great.
[00:09:50.543 --> 00:09:52.726]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com are the websites.
[00:09:52.746 --> 00:09:53.768]  Stay with us.
[00:10:03.974 --> 00:10:07.155]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:10:07.495 --> 00:10:09.456]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:10:09.816 --> 00:10:17.479]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:25.202]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:10:25.602 --> 00:10:28.523]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:10:28.924 --> 00:10:31.264]  A White House probe to disseminate fake news.
[00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:32.485]  NSA spying.
[00:10:32.975 --> 00:10:37.018]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:10:37.319 --> 00:10:40.902]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:10:41.302 --> 00:10:43.263]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:10:43.544 --> 00:10:47.487]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.463]  Hi, this is Tom Andrew with Midas Resources, your source for gold and silver.
[00:11:06.083 --> 00:11:10.927]  Friday, June 1st, gold closed up $10 per ounce and silver closed up 32 cents per ounce.
[00:11:11.227 --> 00:11:15.310]  Significant daily gains and precious metals are not uncommon during volatile times.
[00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.072]  Don't get caught on the wrong side of this market.
[00:11:18.472 --> 00:11:25.036]  Call me today at 1-800-606-1294 to lock in prices as well as your future buying power.
[00:11:25.577 --> 00:11:25.897]  That's 1-800-606-1294.
[00:11:29.292 --> 00:11:35.916]  Precious metals has always preserved purchasing power during times of confiscatory taxation and rampant inflation.
[00:11:36.497 --> 00:11:43.081]  Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan predicts a recession of alarming magnitude due to increasing budget and trade deficits.
[00:11:43.722 --> 00:11:48.765]  Listen folks, the current economic system is like a game of financial musical chairs.
[00:11:48.785 --> 00:11:48.965]  1-800-606-1294.
[00:11:49.085 --> 00:11:54.869]  Don't get caught standing without precious metals when the music stops.
[00:11:55.389 --> 00:11:56.170]  Call me now at 1-800-606-1294.
[00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:04.572]  Hi, Steve Schenck, Furious Task Force.
[00:12:04.872 --> 00:12:07.713]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[00:12:08.214 --> 00:12:10.414]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[00:12:11.035 --> 00:12:19.317]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[00:12:19.798 --> 00:12:20.358]  An example?
[00:12:20.898 --> 00:12:23.679]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[00:12:24.602 --> 00:12:27.365]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[00:12:27.745 --> 00:12:31.068]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[00:12:31.809 --> 00:12:36.994]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[00:12:37.634 --> 00:12:39.096]  Money is not the problem.
[00:12:39.336 --> 00:12:40.317]  Availability is.
[00:12:40.857 --> 00:12:41.318]  Be careful.
[00:12:41.338 --> 00:12:46.583]  When food supplies get short, with no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[00:12:47.228 --> 00:12:50.433]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com 800-409-5633
[00:13:00.828 --> 00:13:05.390]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.732]  Soon, it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:13:09.052 --> 00:13:11.613]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:13:11.973 --> 00:13:16.795]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:13:17.175 --> 00:13:22.558]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:13:22.858 --> 00:13:25.819]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:13:25.999 --> 00:13:26.559]  We're good to go.
[00:13:49.409 --> 00:13:54.874]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:13:55.074 --> 00:13:55.854]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:13:55.995 --> 00:14:05.142]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[00:14:05.202 --> 00:14:07.844]  Well, search no more.
[00:14:08.044 --> 00:14:10.326]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:14:10.947 --> 00:14:13.769]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.952]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:23.815 --> 00:14:24.496]  Welcome back.
[00:14:24.556 --> 00:14:25.616]  It is July 1st, 2007.
[00:14:26.097 --> 00:14:31.481]  We're live here on this Sunday edition.
[00:14:33.682 --> 00:14:34.103]  Okay.
[00:14:38.246 --> 00:14:39.747]  Now, I may be wrong about this.
[00:14:41.388 --> 00:14:43.549]  But I'm going to give the government the benefit of the doubt.
[00:14:45.871 --> 00:14:48.733]  And by that, there's different layers of government.
[00:14:51.135 --> 00:14:52.636]  But I'm going to give the government the benefit of the doubt.
[00:14:54.466 --> 00:15:04.612]  And say, okay, these are real Muslim terrorists that are attempting to shut off, basically, firebombs.
[00:15:06.233 --> 00:15:13.838]  Petrol bombs, gasoline-laden Mercedes and Jeep Cherokees.
[00:15:15.639 --> 00:15:22.203]  Two failed events, of course, on Friday in London, down in Piccadilly Circus,
[00:15:22.785 --> 00:15:25.286]  Where I have stayed when I've been visiting England.
[00:15:25.807 --> 00:15:26.347]  Know it well.
[00:15:27.788 --> 00:15:30.569]  And, of course, up at the airport in Glasgow, Scotland.
[00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:33.630]  But we know this.
[00:15:33.851 --> 00:15:45.216]  The response that we've seen, the unbelievable hand-wringing, I mean, they've called it a fiery apocalypse, thick black plumes of death.
[00:15:45.276 --> 00:15:48.918]  Why, the death toll could have been in the thousands.
[00:15:48.998 --> 00:15:50.479]  It's the end of freedom.
[00:15:51.289 --> 00:15:55.470]  We've got to have secret arrest and secret imprisonment and a new war on terror.
[00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.791]  This could change society forever.
[00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:00.491]  It's unbelievable!
[00:16:00.871 --> 00:16:02.972]  My God, no one's died!
[00:16:03.572 --> 00:16:06.792]  But there could be hundreds of new truck bomb and car bomb attacks.
[00:16:06.832 --> 00:16:12.534]  The reporters are freaking out on air, saying they're having flashbacks of Baghdad.
[00:16:13.814 --> 00:16:16.455]  And explosives going off at the markets.
[00:16:16.515 --> 00:16:18.555]  I mean, it is clear that the media
[00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:26.272]  He is trying to scare the daylights, the living daylights, out of everyone who was watching television.
[00:16:28.373 --> 00:16:31.235]  Now, Gordon Brown is a total New World Order globalist.
[00:16:32.656 --> 00:16:39.659]  Gordon Brown just came in as the new Prime Minister two days before these attacks took place, started on Friday.
[00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:47.743]  There was already talk of no-confidence votes in the Parliament, and Gordon Brown could be out of office in just a few months if he didn't reverse
[00:16:48.486 --> 00:16:54.287]  uh... the occupation of iraq in the unpopular war coming up on five years here in just a few months
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.322]  And then magically, right on time, he said, look, terrorists are going to strike us.
[00:17:00.722 --> 00:17:01.822]  They're going to hit any minute.
[00:17:02.242 --> 00:17:06.884]  You haven't given me the new secret arrest, secret imprisonment powers I want.
[00:17:06.944 --> 00:17:10.206]  I have the BBC transcript here in front of me from just Wednesday.
[00:17:10.786 --> 00:17:12.767]  If you don't do this, the terrorists will strike.
[00:17:12.787 --> 00:17:13.747]  And the people said, no.
[00:17:13.767 --> 00:17:18.289]  We're tired of the millions of cameras, the checkpoints, the loss of liberty in this country.
[00:17:18.889 --> 00:17:20.030]  No, Gordon Brown.
[00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.271]  And boom!
[00:17:23.177 --> 00:17:32.021]  Why, uh, the terrorist attack, and they attacked Glasgow because that's where Gordon Brown's from, and they're testing him.
[00:17:32.061 --> 00:17:36.423]  The terrorists want to see if the British will now run like cowards.
[00:17:37.023 --> 00:17:43.125]  They want to see if the Scots will run like cowards after the evil Muslim terrorists struck.
[00:17:43.165 --> 00:17:51.569]  Will they give the terrorists what they want, or will they show that incredible British stiff upper lip we've always seen and have courage?
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:01.345]  It's like clockwork, and they get to bring out all the images of the 7-7 bombings again two years ago.
[00:18:01.365 --> 00:18:06.589]  You know, I went there right after the first bombings, and then they had the next stage bombings right after I left.
[00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:15.116]  And we've proven in my film Terror Storm, about 30 minutes of the two-hour film is on the London bombings, that it was a government attack.
[00:18:15.849 --> 00:18:26.474]  Absolute proof you can watch Terror Storm for free on Google Video or if you want to just Google Terror Storm or if you want to get a high quality DVD and support me, the filmmaker.
[00:18:26.534 --> 00:18:28.335]  I spent $100,000 making that film.
[00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:32.837]  I haven't made the money back yet, but my accountant says I might in the next three or four months.
[00:18:33.778 --> 00:18:39.561]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.tv, get a 15-cent a day membership and watch it in super high quality, a lot better than Google Video.
[00:18:40.121 --> 00:18:44.283]  They're at PrisonPlanet.tv or go to InfoWars.com or Amazon.com and order a copy.
[00:18:44.642 --> 00:18:46.503]  They're off the site, the high-quality DVD.
[00:18:47.903 --> 00:18:50.384]  But, again, just for free Google Video, if you'd like.
[00:18:50.625 --> 00:18:55.767]  I put it out for free because, folks, we just want people to find out that the government's staging terror.
[00:18:56.667 --> 00:19:00.009]  Now, people may say, well, then why are you saying that this isn't staged terror?
[00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:07.272]  Hundreds of different points go into this analysis.
[00:19:07.652 --> 00:19:09.213]  And, again, I may be wrong.
[00:19:09.813 --> 00:19:12.374]  Many times I've given the government the benefit of the doubt.
[00:19:13.283 --> 00:19:15.705]  Because we know that there are real Muslim terrorists.
[00:19:15.805 --> 00:19:24.092]  There are real Muslims out there who do go on an Israeli bus in Tel Aviv and stab 14 people.
[00:19:25.494 --> 00:19:26.995]  There are real suicide bombers.
[00:19:27.575 --> 00:19:32.520]  There are real combatants that do go and engage in asymmetrical warfare.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.541]  That's really what it is.
[00:19:33.581 --> 00:19:35.582]  It's warfare against civilian targets.
[00:19:35.602 --> 00:19:36.964]  And if you don't think Israel and the U.S.
[00:19:37.024 --> 00:19:39.626]  and England don't do that, then you've got nothing coming, too.
[00:19:39.666 --> 00:19:40.767]  Let's just be real about this.
[00:19:41.929 --> 00:19:47.430]  You know, when a 2,000-pound bomb drops into a place that kills 500 civilians, it's called collateral damage.
[00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.451]  When a Muslim does it up close, it's called the end of Earth.
[00:19:50.511 --> 00:19:51.431]  Give up all your rides.
[00:19:51.771 --> 00:19:53.951]  Oh my God, we're so scared the boogeyman's going to get us.
[00:19:56.012 --> 00:20:02.473]  Now, the bottom line here is that there is really four different types of terrorism.
[00:20:03.073 --> 00:20:03.333]  Okay?
[00:20:03.373 --> 00:20:09.214]  There is the state-sponsored, purely state-sponsored events like 9-11, big, spectacular,
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.223]  Events like 9-11, that the official U.S.
[00:20:13.243 --> 00:20:15.885]  government plan to carry it out, Operation Northwoods talks about.
[00:20:15.986 --> 00:20:24.975]  Big, spectacular events to cause a helpful wave of national indignation and to launch a new war, as Brzezinski talks about, or as Dick Cheney talks about in the PNAC documents.
[00:20:25.856 --> 00:20:29.960]  Needing that big Pearl Harbor-style attack to launch the New World Order.
[00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:33.011]  And to re-kick-start the stalled program.
[00:20:33.631 --> 00:20:36.114]  In 2000, they said, we don't have a big terror attack.
[00:20:36.354 --> 00:20:38.275]  We have Republican memos, too.
[00:20:38.556 --> 00:20:41.018]  If we don't have big terror attacks, it's over!
[00:20:41.598 --> 00:20:44.301]  The people will not go along with expanding war in a world government.
[00:20:44.721 --> 00:20:45.422]  We've got to have them.
[00:20:45.482 --> 00:20:46.102]  Boom, they happen.
[00:20:46.443 --> 00:20:48.144]  Then you look at the evidence, it's an inside job.
[00:20:50.566 --> 00:20:52.608]  So you've got the big spectacular events.
[00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:56.171]  Then you've got two different types of provocateur actions.
[00:20:56.212 --> 00:20:56.572]  You've got
[00:20:57.335 --> 00:21:00.279]  Well, there's even more types than that, but two basics.
[00:21:00.319 --> 00:21:04.144]  But you've got where the government goes out here in the U.S.
[00:21:04.725 --> 00:21:10.773]  and recruits literally mentally retarded black street children in Miami for a year and a half, gives them over $100,000.
[00:21:11.294 --> 00:21:15.219]  They found young, literally retarded black Rasta children.
[00:21:16.283 --> 00:21:22.965]  And they told them, you know, you're Christians, we want to bring you to this warehouse, give you machine guns, weapons, you're going to fight for Jesus.
[00:21:23.005 --> 00:21:28.807]  And they said, you get another $20,000, you'll go videotape the FBI building and say that you're going to be part of a crimson jihad.
[00:21:29.527 --> 00:21:32.508]  And they gave him another $20,000, they went and videotaped it, and they literally were retarded.
[00:21:32.548 --> 00:21:33.589]  That later came out in the news.
[00:21:34.109 --> 00:21:41.471]  The only people, I mean, I could go out and provocateur homeless people for bottles of whiskey to say they were going to carry out attacks and then slap handcuffs on them.
[00:21:42.972 --> 00:21:44.112]  This is just more sophisticated.
[00:21:44.656 --> 00:22:01.832]  There's that type of provocateur action, and we saw that last year up in Toronto, Canada, where they couldn't get the teenagers to shoot their mouths off, so the Royal Mounties just delivered thousands of pounds of fertilizer to the door and busted them.
[00:22:01.852 --> 00:22:06.437]  A few months later, that all came out in court, but by then you'd already heard the fear-mongering in front of the papers.
[00:22:06.757 --> 00:22:08.899]  You never read the retraction, which you can go pull up if you'd like.
[00:22:10.109 --> 00:22:17.794]  And we heard about riots and plots in London, and how they were going to kill everybody, and there have literally been more than 20 of those different plots that turned out to be totally fake.
[00:22:17.834 --> 00:22:24.799]  When we get back, I'll tell you about the other type of provocateur actions, and then real terror, and why this is probably real terror.
[00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:32.424]  And then we'll talk about another form of real terror, using an event to fear-monger and terrorize the people psychologically.
[00:22:33.024 --> 00:22:35.345]  Then we'll take your calls, and a lot more.
[00:22:36.701 --> 00:22:37.561]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:37.642 --> 00:22:45.265]  My news websites, again, are JonesReport.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:22:45.285 --> 00:22:46.786]  They've all got a lot of powerful news and info.
[00:22:46.806 --> 00:22:47.646]  We'll be right back.
[00:23:01.009 --> 00:23:03.710]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:09.831]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally, without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[00:23:10.311 --> 00:23:12.452]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[00:23:12.632 --> 00:23:23.374]  These toxins enter our bodies, and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body, with more than 500 vital functions.
[00:23:24.614 --> 00:23:32.884]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.
[00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:35.928]  And it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.
[00:23:36.308 --> 00:23:43.617]  LIV52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol and prescription medications.
[00:23:43.977 --> 00:23:49.564]  To order Live 52 and for the best source of researched herbal products, visit research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482.

[00:24:52.787 --> 00:24:53.967]  That's toll-free, trip-free,
[00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:03.371]  Come on, Bill.
[00:25:03.571 --> 00:25:08.772]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house?
[00:25:09.112 --> 00:25:10.593]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[00:25:10.693 --> 00:25:12.673]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[00:25:12.953 --> 00:25:18.494]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:25:18.794 --> 00:25:25.075]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:25:25.396 --> 00:25:27.576]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:25:27.876 --> 00:25:31.319]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[00:25:31.579 --> 00:25:31.960]  Whoa!
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.561]  What was that website again?
[00:25:33.661 --> 00:25:37.165]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:25:37.485 --> 00:25:38.586]  Now write this down, John.
[00:25:38.726 --> 00:25:43.030]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.771]  Thanks, Bill.
[00:25:44.031 --> 00:25:45.212]  I'm going there right now.
[00:25:45.652 --> 00:25:46.293]  Check, please!
[00:25:48.079 --> 00:25:49.520]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:50.601]  Sure, John.
[00:25:50.841 --> 00:25:55.203]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:25:55.523 --> 00:25:57.204]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[00:25:57.364 --> 00:25:57.725]  Deal.
[00:25:59.566 --> 00:26:04.508]  Hello, I'm Dr. Bill Deagles, a new comedical report here on Genesis after Alex Jones 2-4 Monday to Friday.
[00:26:04.849 --> 00:26:13.133]  Develop the first line of defense kit to block pathogenic infective organisms to give you day-to-day protection as well as infection protection against biological and chemical weapons.
[00:26:13.193 --> 00:26:14.514]  Defense tabs block virus
[00:26:14.574 --> 00:26:15.054]  We're good.
[00:26:44.594 --> 00:26:46.215]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:26:46.235 --> 00:26:47.036]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:14.611]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:27:17.311 --> 00:27:18.372]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:27:23.653 --> 00:27:28.675]  Alright, this is one of the pre-911 definitions of terrorism.
[00:27:28.715 --> 00:27:30.895]  This is from Webster's Dictionary.
[00:27:30.955 --> 00:27:33.136]  It's still one of the definitions up there.
[00:27:34.858 --> 00:27:40.219]  Under the Patriot Act, it's any action that attempts to influence public officials.
[00:27:40.259 --> 00:27:41.400]  No longer are they called servants.
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.440]  They're changing all the language.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.500]  It's also in Section 802 of the Patriot Act.
[00:27:45.901 --> 00:27:47.821]  Terrorism is any misdemeanor.
[00:27:48.481 --> 00:27:56.243]  And now under the John Warren Defense Authorization Act, the Enemy Combatant Designations, the Military Commissions Act,
[00:27:57.257 --> 00:28:01.959]  For any misdemeanor, you can be secretly arrested, secretly tortured, and secretly executed.
[00:28:02.299 --> 00:28:03.619]  That's all in the legislation.
[00:28:03.679 --> 00:28:04.720]  I challenge you to go read it.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:05.860]  Now on the books.
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:16.724]  Now, Hitler could put it on the books that he was allowed to kill children if they had any type of birth defects, including being Jewish.
[00:28:16.764 --> 00:28:20.585]  They saw that as a birth defect, as something wrong with you, as a disease.
[00:28:21.326 --> 00:28:22.246]  It didn't mean it so.
[00:28:23.212 --> 00:28:28.713]  And it doesn't mean that just because our government said that blacks weren't humans that that was a true law and that you had to put up with it.
[00:28:28.993 --> 00:28:30.534]  So again, I'm not following any of your bull.
[00:28:30.834 --> 00:28:33.334]  I just hope you understand that right up front here.
[00:28:34.054 --> 00:28:36.915]  And don't worry, Bush will probably leave office and hand the powers over to Hillary.
[00:28:36.935 --> 00:28:38.295]  Then all the Democrats are going to love it.
[00:28:40.316 --> 00:28:42.596]  But this is one of the definitions of terrorism.
[00:28:42.616 --> 00:28:43.857]  This is one of the classic ones.
[00:28:44.717 --> 00:28:45.717]  One of the more accurate ones.
[00:28:46.737 --> 00:28:48.918]  This is the number one from a Webster dictionary in 1999.
[00:28:50.356 --> 00:28:56.317]  1.
[00:28:50.376 --> 00:28:56.317]  The use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes.
[00:28:56.817 --> 00:28:56.317]  2.
[00:28:57.477 --> 00:29:01.898]  The state of fear and submission produced by terrorism or terrorization.
[00:29:02.598 --> 00:29:01.898]  3.
[00:29:03.098 --> 00:29:06.959]  A terroristic method of governing or of resisting a government.
[00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:11.560]  Random House Unabridged Dictionary has a similar quote.
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:13.860]  Similar definitions.
[00:29:15.301 --> 00:29:17.721]  So, let me just explain some history of people.
[00:29:19.233 --> 00:29:20.994]  There were, and I actually looked this up.
[00:29:21.414 --> 00:29:24.155]  Last night, I didn't want to go off memory today, so I looked it up.
[00:29:25.236 --> 00:29:28.477]  And this is in the FBI's historical archives online.
[00:29:28.897 --> 00:29:30.738]  I also found a similar number at Wikipedia.
[00:29:31.138 --> 00:29:32.939]  One says 133, one says 137.
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:46.865]  Over 130 bombings from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s of the Sinbanese Liberation Army, the Weathermen, and several other allied communist groups in the U.S.
[00:29:48.143 --> 00:29:50.584]  Now, these are real terror groups.
[00:29:51.205 --> 00:30:00.970]  They detonated a few car bombs, but mainly they like to mail packages to police departments in Chicago, New York, San Francisco, other areas.
[00:30:02.991 --> 00:30:07.033]  And it blinded scores of police, killed quite a few people.
[00:30:08.374 --> 00:30:10.275]  This was a real terror campaign.
[00:30:11.039 --> 00:30:20.770]  And because the government didn't want to spread it or create fear, newspapers were encouraged, television was encouraged not to give it a lot of attention, and it was simply made to be minor footnotes.
[00:30:21.511 --> 00:30:24.675]  Because back when there was real terror, you don't give it attention.
[00:30:25.936 --> 00:30:26.317]  Okay?
[00:30:26.537 --> 00:30:28.339]  Because then that's what the terrorists want.
[00:30:30.686 --> 00:30:40.192]  All right, and then that causes the government to crack down on the public, setting up a police state, which then causes resistance, and the state is discredited, and the society falls apart.
[00:30:40.532 --> 00:30:49.357]  Now, if you want a society to fall apart, and you want to set up an old-fashioned dictatorship, states, the Russians, the Nazis, the Chinese did this.
[00:30:50.317 --> 00:30:55.480]  It's one of their favorite tricks in different areas of Asia.
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.561]  They've been caught doing it a lot.
[00:30:58.695 --> 00:31:09.463]  You stage terror attacks, you stage massacres, you stage hotel bombings, school bombings, and you blame it on your political enemies and use that as an excuse to crack down and set up police state or martial law.
[00:31:11.304 --> 00:31:13.946]  And this has been done over and over and over again.
[00:31:14.266 --> 00:31:18.729]  It's mainstream news that the Philippine government just did it a few years ago and been doing it for 30 years.
[00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:25.193]  It's come out in Malaysia, now declassified, admitted since the 50s right through the 90s they've been doing it.
[00:31:26.134 --> 00:31:27.375]  I mean, it's just, it's constant.
[00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:33.454]  And it's big, it's spectacular, and it's ongoing.
[00:31:34.634 --> 00:31:44.002]  And I've interviewed high-level MI5 British commandos, it's been in the BBC, it's been in the Times of London, it's been in hundreds of news articles.
[00:31:44.362 --> 00:31:44.803]  Hundreds.
[00:31:45.944 --> 00:31:48.926]  We have whole sections on PrisonPlanet.com, and I have two writers that live there.
[00:31:49.266 --> 00:31:51.568]  The editors and the webmasters live in England, folks.
[00:31:51.948 --> 00:31:55.011]  It's kind of an anglophile
[00:31:55.903 --> 00:32:00.286]  It is mainstream news in England now, quietly announced and admitted, that 75 plus percent
[00:32:22.601 --> 00:32:30.665]  Of the bombings, the hundreds of bombings in Northern Ireland and in England carried out by the IRA from 1980 until 2001 were carried directly out by British intelligence.
[00:32:30.705 --> 00:32:32.486]  The other 25% in almost every case were
[00:32:44.835 --> 00:32:49.960]  Funded and supported by, I mean the heads it turned out of IRA were British Intelligence.
[00:32:50.281 --> 00:32:51.722]  They were commanding people.
[00:32:52.023 --> 00:32:59.631]  Now there are a few cases of kneecappings, people being shot, crowds being shot at that were real IRA.
[00:33:02.339 --> 00:33:12.922]  But literally, the vast majority of the attacks, because every time they were voting for peace, voting to kick the Brits out of Northern Ireland, voting to have true Ireland sovereignty, boom!
[00:33:12.982 --> 00:33:15.243]  Big ol' car bombs, people dying, mass shootings.
[00:33:15.563 --> 00:33:16.963]  Oh, the army's gotta come in.
[00:33:17.263 --> 00:33:18.784]  Oh, we gotta suspend your government.
[00:33:19.124 --> 00:33:20.364]  Oh, we gotta run things.
[00:33:22.124 --> 00:33:31.527]  So, you've gotta understand that any time we see a terror attack in England, we go, hmm, let me see, the British literally wrote the book,
[00:33:32.168 --> 00:33:35.333]  In the last 200 years, they love doing this in India.
[00:33:36.836 --> 00:33:40.442]  Oh, we've got a terror attack, and this helps the government.
[00:33:40.722 --> 00:33:41.764]  This helps their position.
[00:33:42.065 --> 00:33:43.367]  Let's go see if they're behind it.
[00:33:43.487 --> 00:33:45.250]  And most of the time, they are.
[00:33:46.107 --> 00:33:51.191]  Nine times out of ten, they either purely carry it out, or were supporting it and provocateuring it.
[00:33:51.211 --> 00:33:52.552]  And those are the different types of terror.
[00:33:52.812 --> 00:34:03.040]  Purely state-sponsored, then you've got provocateured, where they go find generally mentally retarded people, like the first World Trade Center attack, cook the bomb, train the driver, give them the debt, let them carry it out.
[00:34:04.059 --> 00:34:12.523]  Miami, Toronto, or then you have the case where they just bust innocent people and just get the headlines and a month later admit, okay, they weren't terrorists.
[00:34:12.783 --> 00:34:13.824]  We were just questioning them.
[00:34:14.124 --> 00:34:15.784]  Those are just purely made-up cases.
[00:34:16.305 --> 00:34:22.207]  And then you've got other provocateur actions where you've got the CIA, Shin Bet, Mossad, MI6.
[00:34:22.227 --> 00:34:23.188]  They've all been caught.
[00:34:23.648 --> 00:34:25.149]  This is Jerusalem Post, folks.
[00:34:25.189 --> 00:34:25.949]  This is AP.
[00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:26.629]  This is Reuters.
[00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:29.831]  Where they've been caught
[00:34:31.468 --> 00:34:40.591]  Staging these events by funding a terror group that then funds a sub-terror group under them that literally believes they're really carrying out a real attack.
[00:34:40.732 --> 00:34:45.633]  But the funding, the command and the control, everything came from the major Western powers.
[00:34:46.594 --> 00:35:00.699]  And then if even local police or FBI or Shin Bet try to stop it or other Israeli commandos, our governments have actually gone in and killed them before to make sure the attacks take place.
[00:35:02.032 --> 00:35:02.332]  Okay?
[00:35:02.373 --> 00:35:04.134]  I mean, so there's also shepherding.
[00:35:04.354 --> 00:35:09.700]  You'll have terrorists literally being shepherded by MI6, Mossad, FBI, CIA.
[00:35:10.681 --> 00:35:12.142]  And there's hundreds of... I mean, what?
[00:35:12.182 --> 00:35:13.664]  Jerusalem Post three weeks ago.
[00:35:14.604 --> 00:35:15.065]  Headline.
[00:35:15.994 --> 00:35:21.137]  Shin bet behind 1976 hijacking with Idi Amin.
[00:35:21.397 --> 00:35:34.284]  Well, of course, you go see The King of Scotland, The Last King of Scotland, great film, very accurate about Idi Amin, horrible person, and admits that the Mossad put him in, the Mossad supported him, and in the movie, oh, he turns against him and does this hijacking.
[00:35:34.805 --> 00:35:35.105]  No!
[00:35:35.505 --> 00:35:37.766]  He did that deal with him, it's now declassified!
[00:35:37.947 --> 00:35:38.627]  That isn't me!
[00:35:38.807 --> 00:35:40.928]  That's the Jerusalem Post front page!
[00:35:42.249 --> 00:35:43.350]  There are hundreds of these.
[00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:43.830]  Type in
[00:35:45.894 --> 00:35:48.996]  The reason I talk about Israel a lot is because that's where they've been caught a lot.
[00:35:50.056 --> 00:35:52.517]  Type in, Israel caught staging fake terror.
[00:35:52.878 --> 00:35:54.659]  Israel caught creating fake Al-Qaeda groups.
[00:35:55.399 --> 00:35:58.600]  Every time there's about to be a peace deal, Israel carries out an attack.
[00:35:58.881 --> 00:36:01.142]  Every time they want to invade the West Bank, they carry out an attack.
[00:36:01.662 --> 00:36:04.383]  Now, is that not saying there aren't real Muslim terrorists?
[00:36:04.764 --> 00:36:05.024]  No!
[00:36:05.284 --> 00:36:08.225]  But when Israel needs there to be an event, they can't always guarantee it.
[00:36:09.466 --> 00:36:11.767]  So see, there's all these different types of staged events.
[00:36:12.247 --> 00:36:15.469]  Then there are purely true, real terror attacks.
[00:36:16.224 --> 00:36:18.825]  Again, it's idiots that can't get cars to blow up.
[00:36:19.346 --> 00:36:20.646]  It's tanks of gasoline.
[00:36:21.307 --> 00:36:26.909]  It's a woman stabbing, again, 14 people, a real case, on a Tel Aviv bus.
[00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:28.670]  Okay?
[00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:29.571]  That's real.
[00:36:30.071 --> 00:36:33.372]  Now maybe Gordon Brown's gotten so sophisticated over there, and he's bad, man.
[00:36:33.492 --> 00:36:34.733]  This guy's as bad as they come.
[00:36:34.753 --> 00:36:37.194]  We've been talking about him the last few months.
[00:36:37.214 --> 00:36:37.735]  Now you know who he is.
[00:36:37.755 --> 00:36:38.555]  You've seen him on the news now.
[00:36:40.717 --> 00:36:41.899]  When we get back, we're going to go to your calls.
[00:36:41.939 --> 00:36:46.066]  The point is, I've made my point, and I've got one more little caveat about this when we take your calls.
[00:36:46.367 --> 00:36:47.248]  We've got a bunch of other news.
[00:36:47.268 --> 00:36:50.514]  The attack on free speech, Kim Trails, it's all coming up.
[00:36:50.534 --> 00:36:50.875]  Stay with me.
[00:37:01.656 --> 00:37:04.757]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.

[00:38:01.866 --> 00:38:03.627]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[00:38:03.927 --> 00:38:06.769]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[00:38:07.269 --> 00:38:09.470]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[00:38:10.091 --> 00:38:18.395]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[00:38:18.876 --> 00:38:19.416]  An example?
[00:38:19.956 --> 00:38:22.778]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[00:38:23.678 --> 00:38:26.440]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.082]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[00:38:30.859 --> 00:38:36.041]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[00:38:36.661 --> 00:38:38.142]  Money is not the problem.
[00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:39.362]  Availability is.
[00:38:39.902 --> 00:38:41.743]  Be careful when food supplies get short.
[00:38:42.003 --> 00:38:45.664]  With no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[00:38:46.284 --> 00:38:48.385]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633.
[00:38:48.405 --> 00:38:49.445]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.

[00:39:02.775 --> 00:39:03.836]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:39:04.156 --> 00:39:06.939]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:39:07.199 --> 00:39:11.364]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:39:11.784 --> 00:39:12.625]  So what do you do?
[00:39:12.945 --> 00:39:17.510]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:20.111]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:35.296]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:39:35.336 --> 00:39:42.399]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:09.505]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water, a world in which our produce is grown naturally, without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[00:40:10.005 --> 00:40:12.146]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[00:40:12.306 --> 00:40:23.052]  These toxins enter our bodies, and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body, with more than 500 vital functions.
[00:40:24.173 --> 00:40:24.553]  I think so.

[00:40:58.635 --> 00:41:07.221]  News, politics, sports, cars, home improvement, health, and everything in between, we've got you covered.
[00:41:07.281 --> 00:41:09.623]  You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[00:41:12.342 --> 00:41:23.669]  Coming to you from the capital of Texas, broadcasting the truth coast to coast and worldwide, this is the Alex Jones Show!
[00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:34.416]  We don't know the truth about what's happening in England right now, but we do know that the state is behaving in classical terrorist fashion.
[00:41:34.736 --> 00:41:39.539]  You don't have to just stage a terror attack or carry out a terror attack to be a terrorist.
[00:41:40.584 --> 00:41:47.913]  If somebody else has done something violent, you hype it and create fear and say, give me your liberties, give me your freedom, let me raise the taxes.
[00:41:48.894 --> 00:41:51.257]  Don't worry about what I'm doing involved with corruption.
[00:41:51.297 --> 00:41:52.959]  Stop any investigations on me.
[00:41:54.561 --> 00:41:55.241]  Because the...
[00:41:56.437 --> 00:41:57.557]  The terrorist will get you.
[00:41:57.597 --> 00:42:05.560]  I mean, Dick Cheney has said that, you know, don't question me on any of the corruption charges or any of the problems or any of the no-bid contracts or Al-Qaeda will nuke major cities.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.121]  That is terrorism.
[00:42:07.181 --> 00:42:21.325]  Again, the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes, the state of fear and submission produced by terrorism or terrorization, the terroristic method of governing or of resisting a government.
[00:42:21.706 --> 00:42:23.086]  Random House on a Bridge Dictionary.
[00:42:24.477 --> 00:42:29.679]  Creating fear, a climate of fear, and saying, do what I say or the bad guys are going to get you.
[00:42:29.919 --> 00:42:30.759]  I mean, you can see them.
[00:42:31.459 --> 00:42:35.440]  Incredible, fiery holocaust that could have killed thousands.
[00:42:35.961 --> 00:42:38.902]  Thick, black, billowing smoke.
[00:42:39.542 --> 00:42:42.563]  I mean, it was just like everything they can do to terrorize you.
[00:42:43.263 --> 00:42:50.265]  And if I have to look at this and try to analyze and go off a hunch from a hundred plus other cases and the MO, this is how this went down.
[00:42:51.505 --> 00:42:52.986]  These are going to be Pakistanis.
[00:42:55.437 --> 00:43:08.829]  They're going to be Wahhabi, Shia, that's the group that Al-Qaeda comes from, and you notice out of the gate they're having to admit it's not, quote, Al-Qaeda, because that would be command and control.
[00:43:08.849 --> 00:43:20.279]  These are individuals who, again, the West, after World War II, funded all these groups, made sure they got into power in the Middle East, Central Asia, quote, as a hedge against communism.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.541]  More blowback.
[00:43:21.581 --> 00:43:22.981]  No, the Pentagon documents are now out.
[00:43:23.041 --> 00:43:39.971]  They actually knew that they would then become subversive and start attacking the West, and that that would be a pretext to then move force in, as the P-2-O-G plans Associated Press broke in 2002, where the Pentagon says, we're going to go in the Middle East, invade, and it's actually meant not to bring a stabilizing effect of democracy,
[00:43:40.231 --> 00:43:40.832]  See how that works folks?
[00:43:40.852 --> 00:43:44.755]  It's meant to... Because if they didn't have real Muslim terrorists, or a big crop of them, before 9-11, well after the invasions, they do.
[00:43:44.795 --> 00:43:50.460]  And then England, if they're telling us how the Muslims are going to kill us any minute, we've got to give up all our rights, have cameras on every street corner,
[00:44:09.127 --> 00:44:15.749]  They're only using the anti-terror laws to abuse and control the general public, while bringing in record numbers of Central Asians and Middle Easterners.
[00:44:16.729 --> 00:44:18.129]  Record numbers!
[00:44:18.809 --> 00:44:27.632]  Accelerating them in, and then while they fear-monger and say it's part of the Crimson Jihad, the end of Earth, just prepare to die, the Muslims are going to get us their own Jihad.
[00:44:30.032 --> 00:44:31.093]  So you think about that, too.
[00:44:31.113 --> 00:44:36.274]  Oh, we've got to give up all your rights and have random checkpoints on the streets of America, but the borders are going to be wide open.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.060]  Now, what happened?
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:43.622]  Tony Blair, on his last day in office last Tuesday, signed the European Union Treaty.
[00:44:44.982 --> 00:44:47.783]  First they tried to deny he'd signed it, then it came out he had signed it.
[00:44:48.283 --> 00:45:00.947]  Europe rejected this last year, but England's signing on to go under their laws, no free speech, hate crimes laws, no more jurisprudence, or the Magna Carta type laws that England had.
[00:45:01.188 --> 00:45:02.488]  This is serious police state.
[00:45:04.002 --> 00:45:04.923]  It was in deep trouble.
[00:45:04.943 --> 00:45:08.849]  There were calls for Gordon Brown to either repeal this or step down.
[00:45:09.269 --> 00:45:10.691]  Now there's been terror attacks.
[00:45:10.751 --> 00:45:11.953]  Now everybody will forget.
[00:45:12.614 --> 00:45:14.597]  Oh, now we can have more draconian laws.
[00:45:15.738 --> 00:45:16.900]  This is probably what happened.
[00:45:18.368 --> 00:45:36.431]  They know there's real organic cells at these Muslim Imams, at these mosques, where they allow them, they put it on British TV, they hype it, who say, kill all the Americans, bomb the British, slit their throats, murder them, we're going to kill them all, we're going to take over.
[00:45:37.572 --> 00:45:40.872]  Folks, if I started talking like that on air and said I was a Christian, I'd be arrested.
[00:45:41.372 --> 00:45:43.413]  Sort of saying, kill people and murder and slaughter.
[00:45:44.213 --> 00:45:44.413]  Okay?
[00:45:45.709 --> 00:45:52.594]  So now that builds up all the fear, and then they've got real Muslims who will go out and do this, and so the door is open for them.
[00:45:52.794 --> 00:45:53.915]  Now that's guaranteed.
[00:45:56.016 --> 00:46:09.305]  And in every other case we've seen, in England, you will find out that the head Wahhabist will be an MI6 or MI5 agent, or will be an asset and would have been paid millions of pounds, that's millions of dollars,
[00:46:10.559 --> 00:46:13.501]  And we'll be commanding them to do this.
[00:46:13.581 --> 00:46:18.645]  So what you've got is an agent, you know, with the big beard and the turban and the rest of it, giving them the orders.
[00:46:18.665 --> 00:46:21.687]  That's what it turned out with Sheikh Abdel Rahman.
[00:46:21.727 --> 00:46:25.550]  That's what it turned out with so many of these other cases.
[00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:26.831]  It's in my film, Terror Storm.
[00:46:27.771 --> 00:46:34.176]  The mainstream news turned out that the commander of the bombers on 7-7 was a known MI6 and was being protected.
[00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:38.951]  It turns out those guys were told they were doing a drill and were carrying bags.
[00:46:39.351 --> 00:46:43.133]  It turned out there were bombs on trains and buses that didn't have people on board.
[00:46:43.533 --> 00:46:49.675]  It turns out that there were drills being run by the government at the exact same time and the same things being bombed.
[00:46:49.955 --> 00:46:50.955]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:46:51.015 --> 00:46:53.396]  It's just, there's so many facets to this.
[00:46:53.636 --> 00:46:57.957]  But the bottom line is, when you give up your liberty, you don't get security.
[00:46:58.378 --> 00:46:59.678]  And there's no point
[00:47:01.807 --> 00:47:08.569]  I mean, let's say there were a thousand terrorists in every city, and they were going to start shooting us and killing us.
[00:47:08.909 --> 00:47:11.570]  The answer is, have more citizens with guns.
[00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:13.631]  Have the citizens work with the police.
[00:47:14.211 --> 00:47:16.252]  I mean, Americans weren't afraid 1,500 years ago.
[00:47:17.632 --> 00:47:24.074]  You know, we had the German government trying to hire Mexico to attack the Southwest, and they did, and killed 23 people in one night.
[00:47:25.114 --> 00:47:30.616]  And Texans just got together with the Texas Rangers and went down there and took on the Mexican Army and their German advisors and kicked their butt.
[00:47:31.656 --> 00:47:37.907]  You know, we don't need to sit here and give up all of our liberties in the name of some phantom menace of terror.
[00:47:38.508 --> 00:47:41.133]  And even averaging the 2,897 deaths into the equation in the last 10 years,
[00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:50.631]  You, on average, are 400 times more likely to die in a car accident.
[00:47:50.711 --> 00:47:51.671]  Okay, I'm going to go over this.
[00:47:51.771 --> 00:47:55.393]  Car crashes kill 400 times more than terrorism.
[00:47:55.853 --> 00:47:59.275]  Car crashes kill 400 times more than international terrorism does in developed countries.
[00:47:59.595 --> 00:48:13.281]  The death toll from car crashes in developed countries is 400 times greater than the number of deaths caused by international terrorism, reports a study in the latest issue of Injury Prevention.
[00:48:13.301 --> 00:48:15.742]  This is a major actuary study for the insurance companies.
[00:48:16.846 --> 00:48:22.570]  In 2001, as many people died in the first 26 days on U.S.
[00:48:22.631 --> 00:48:26.573]  roads as died in the terrorist bombings of 9-11, the study shows.
[00:48:27.854 --> 00:48:30.996]  Again, in 2001, as many people died every 26 days on U.S.
[00:48:31.036 --> 00:48:34.019]  roads as died in the terrorist bombings of 9-11, the study shows.
[00:48:34.479 --> 00:48:44.586]  The authors compared the number of deaths from international terrorism and car crashes in 29 countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD.
[00:48:44.926 --> 00:48:45.867]  That's the International
[00:48:47.484 --> 00:48:49.647]  Debt holder on all government investments.
[00:48:50.388 --> 00:48:51.890]  You want to know who runs the planet, folks?
[00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:57.917]  It's the Economic Cooperation Development Organization of Economic Cooperation Development, OECD.
[00:48:58.618 --> 00:48:59.439]  Anyways, I digress.
[00:48:59.915 --> 00:49:01.356]  Between 94 and 2003.
[00:49:01.416 --> 00:49:03.136]  They used the U.S.
[00:49:03.156 --> 00:49:15.841]  State Department's Counterterrorism Office database for deaths caused by international terrorist activity, and the OECD International Road Transport Accident Database for 2000 and 2001 for those caused by car crashes.
[00:49:16.101 --> 00:49:20.723]  You want to know why we got the same laws England's got, or why Texas has the same laws that Montreal has?
[00:49:21.323 --> 00:49:22.884]  It's because of the OECD, folks.
[00:49:22.924 --> 00:49:27.586]  They run the lobbyists, city managers, the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports, they run it all.
[00:49:27.786 --> 00:49:28.626]  But that's another issue.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:35.606]  So, you're 400 times, and it's higher, it's lower in some countries.
[00:49:37.008 --> 00:49:38.169]  Higher in some, lower in others.
[00:49:38.189 --> 00:49:41.072]  But the point is, 400 times more likely to die in a car accident.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:44.242]  And, uh, where's all the fear?
[00:49:44.282 --> 00:49:49.546]  I mean, you'd think that a giant asteroid was coming at the Earth to kill us all, the way they act on Fox and CNN.
[00:49:49.586 --> 00:49:53.729]  I mean, it's fiery apocalypse, black smoke, total destruction.
[00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:55.791]  The people are bracing for the worst.
[00:49:56.191 --> 00:49:58.473]  Will the evil terror strike America?
[00:49:58.493 --> 00:50:00.174]  Is Iran behind it?
[00:50:00.254 --> 00:50:01.395]  Should we invade?
[00:50:04.598 --> 00:50:11.103]  Meanwhile, I go rent one day in September the Academy Award winning film, narrated by Michael Douglas,
[00:50:12.958 --> 00:50:19.740]  And in that film, they admit that British intelligence staged the terror attacks with Muslim extremists in Europe.
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:23.401]  And they have the former head of the Russian intelligence admitting they staged terror attacks.
[00:50:24.742 --> 00:50:32.064]  The film ends with the German head of security, at the time, admitting that they staged terror attacks with Muslims.
[00:50:34.425 --> 00:50:38.506]  Now we have the Jerusalem Post front page, Israel staging the deal with Idi Amin.
[00:50:38.766 --> 00:50:40.647]  I'm sick of it, and I'm tired of it!
[00:50:41.607 --> 00:50:42.967]  You want to know what I'm scared of?
[00:50:43.128 --> 00:50:44.728]  You want to know what I lose sleep at night about?
[00:50:45.268 --> 00:50:51.110]  Knowing that the Western governments, ladies and gentlemen, funded Stalin, funded Mao, funded Hitler.
[00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:52.311]  I have all the documents.
[00:50:52.491 --> 00:50:53.531]  I have them all right here.
[00:50:54.591 --> 00:50:55.592]  I actually brought some of them today.
[00:50:55.612 --> 00:50:57.733]  I'm going to try to read them next hour to you.
[00:50:59.433 --> 00:51:00.193]  I'm sick of it.
[00:51:01.354 --> 00:51:01.954]  I'm tired of it.
[00:51:01.994 --> 00:51:04.075]  They create these monsters, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:04.315 --> 00:51:05.135]  They build them up.
[00:51:05.955 --> 00:51:10.497]  Then they point them at us and tell us we've got to worship them and give up our whole way of life.
[00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:17.475]  By the way, we're not going to celebrate the 4th of July in three days, because we're celebrating hot dogs and fireworks.
[00:51:19.396 --> 00:51:33.788]  Those fireworks symbolize mortar shells and cannons, and our troops fighting 6-1, 8-1, 10-1 against the British, the most trained army in the world, because they were taking our liberties and our freedoms, and enslaving us, and because the British cops were acting like thugs.
[00:51:34.838 --> 00:51:37.567]  I want you to remember that this upcoming July 4th.
[00:51:37.948 --> 00:51:41.840]  What America is really about and what that day symbolizes.
[00:51:43.301 --> 00:51:52.208]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:30.632]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:52:31.292 --> 00:52:37.675]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:53:07.008 --> 00:53:08.849]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:10.209 --> 00:53:11.790]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:14.971]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[00:53:24.614 --> 00:53:29.036]  Alright, we are going to go to your calls now.
[00:53:31.096 --> 00:53:33.017]  We will get straight to them.
[00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:42.171]  Then I'm going to get into the attack on the First Amendment in this country, not just on talk radio, but on journalism, period.
[00:53:42.331 --> 00:53:43.051]  Very scary.
[00:53:43.531 --> 00:53:45.852]  And how the public's been trained to accept the National ID Card.
[00:53:45.872 --> 00:53:51.153]  I want to read some famous globalist quotes where they admit they're setting up a world government tyranny against us.
[00:53:51.653 --> 00:53:53.573]  And some news on Kim Trill's coming up.
[00:53:54.293 --> 00:53:55.853]  I got several people disagree with me.
[00:53:57.174 --> 00:54:02.314]  And so, uh, we're going to go to Mike in Santa Fe.
[00:54:03.615 --> 00:54:05.295]  We're going to go to Joe in Atlanta.
[00:54:06.331 --> 00:54:08.793]  We're going to go to Bernie and Colleen.
[00:54:09.894 --> 00:54:12.396]  Colleen, we're going to go to Allen in Cedar Park.
[00:54:12.896 --> 00:54:13.937]  John in New York.
[00:54:14.418 --> 00:54:14.998]  Don in Pennsylvania.
[00:54:15.018 --> 00:54:16.079]  I'm going to get to everybody right now.
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:17.921]  Let's go ahead.
[00:54:18.001 --> 00:54:22.084]  I'm not being fair to those that have been holding a long time because I've got to go to folks that disagree first.
[00:54:22.765 --> 00:54:27.028]  Let's go to Bernie, listening out there, I guess near Fort Hood.
[00:54:27.388 --> 00:54:28.029]  You're on the air.
[00:54:28.089 --> 00:54:28.469]  Go ahead.
[00:54:30.331 --> 00:54:31.231]  Hey, what's going on Alex?
[00:54:31.252 --> 00:54:31.652]  How you doing?
[00:54:32.446 --> 00:54:34.227]  Doing a syndicated radio show right now.
[00:54:34.287 --> 00:54:35.008]  Sir, what's on your mind?
[00:54:35.428 --> 00:54:40.171]  I just wanted to say that, uh, you know, there's a lot of stuff I've been following, you know, in the short time I've been listening to you.
[00:54:40.611 --> 00:54:41.252]  I'm from New York.
[00:54:41.292 --> 00:54:42.512]  I've been down here for a few months.
[00:54:43.173 --> 00:54:47.556]  And, uh, I just want to say that, you know, I never hear you talking about, you know, the Israelis.
[00:54:47.976 --> 00:54:48.957]  You know, I'm a Jew, man.
[00:54:49.157 --> 00:54:52.839]  You know, I know my own people are involved in stuff that's shady.
[00:54:53.159 --> 00:54:53.960]  So what do you got to say?
[00:54:55.479 --> 00:54:57.280]  Well, were you listening last hour?
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:02.324]  I mean, there's evil stuff... Even if I was listening last hour, Alex, does that make a difference?
[00:55:02.384 --> 00:55:04.425]  I mean, I've been listening to you long enough to make an assessment.
[00:55:04.766 --> 00:55:07.007]  Look, I'm not... You know what I'm going to do?
[00:55:07.027 --> 00:55:08.208]  Hold on just a second, sir.
[00:55:08.248 --> 00:55:14.893]  I mean, let me talk, because you asked me a question, and then I started trying to answer it.
[00:55:15.413 --> 00:55:24.960]  I probably spent ten minutes in the last hour alone talking about Israeli newspapers admitting that the government stages terror attacks.
[00:55:25.558 --> 00:55:29.981]  And so then you call in and you say that I'm giving Israel a free pass.
[00:55:30.041 --> 00:55:30.701]  I'm really confused.
[00:55:30.721 --> 00:55:31.162]  No, no, no.
[00:55:31.262 --> 00:55:33.263]  Don't put words in my mouth like Fox News does.
[00:55:33.363 --> 00:55:35.304]  I don't want to hear that.
[00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:38.947]  You know as well as I do that there's a Zionist movement going on.
[00:55:39.127 --> 00:55:40.528]  They're different from the regular Jews.
[00:55:40.868 --> 00:55:41.468]  I know they are.
[00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:43.930]  Because they're not in the best interest of our country.
[00:55:45.399 --> 00:55:47.219]  And I know there's a lot of black ops, too.
[00:55:47.239 --> 00:55:49.040]  I don't hear you saying enough that, you know what?
[00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:54.501]  There has been violent activity involved in a lot of these black ops, and we're blaming them on Al-Qaeda or Al-Qaeda.
[00:55:54.561 --> 00:55:55.061]  I don't know.
[00:55:55.101 --> 00:55:55.541]  You tell me.
[00:55:56.541 --> 00:55:58.341]  Well, listen, sir, I appreciate your call.
[00:55:59.341 --> 00:56:00.542]  I have to say this, though.
[00:56:01.002 --> 00:56:13.404]  About 90% of the Patriot movement is focused on the North American Union, national sovereignty, the Second Amendment, land rights, things that we're having victories on, things that we're having life-and-death fights on and we're barely winning.
[00:56:15.476 --> 00:56:21.941]  And, you know, I try to have a big tent here and cover the big issues, and cover things that I can document that are happening.
[00:56:23.523 --> 00:56:27.085]  And then I get up here on air, and every day I get emails and phone calls.
[00:56:27.646 --> 00:56:35.372]  Hey man, you're not saying it's a Catholic conspiracy, you know, you're a... and they'll make up some weird name, I don't even know what it means.
[00:56:35.692 --> 00:56:37.674]  I'm not Catholic, I'm not saying it's bad to be Catholic either.
[00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:38.855]  I have a lot of Catholic friends.
[00:56:39.215 --> 00:56:42.738]  But I mean, they'll call in and go, you're covering up for the Vatican, they run everything.
[00:56:43.524 --> 00:56:46.827]  Or I get calls every day, you're covering up for Israel, and they run everything.
[00:56:47.047 --> 00:56:57.155]  Listen, the Pope has called for one world government, a new world order, and Catholic groups have said that's horrible, and I've spoken out against it, and definitely it's pushing the new world order.
[00:56:58.075 --> 00:57:07.322]  Israel clearly stages a lot of terror attacks, has clearly been caught, and admits they do it, and we're here exposing that, which by the way is cutting edge for talk radio, sir.
[00:57:09.304 --> 00:57:11.786]  So I expose, I mean listen, what's the Bible say?
[00:57:11.826 --> 00:57:13.287]  It says you're going to have evil in high places.
[00:57:13.962 --> 00:57:17.084]  You know, I mean, in the Bible, Caesar's bad and so is Herod.
[00:57:17.104 --> 00:57:19.786]  You know, the Roman leader's bad and so is the Jewish leader.
[00:57:20.066 --> 00:57:21.487]  I mean, evil's in high places.
[00:57:22.948 --> 00:57:25.310]  That's what the philosophers said, common sense says.
[00:57:25.830 --> 00:57:29.733]  And so I'm just here going, hey, they're pushing the North American Union, let's fight it.
[00:57:30.373 --> 00:57:33.135]  Or, hey, governments tend to stage a lot of these terror attacks.
[00:57:34.216 --> 00:57:36.237]  Do you think these latest events are government?
[00:57:36.257 --> 00:57:38.299]  And I go, they're not very sophisticated, they may not be.
[00:57:39.399 --> 00:57:42.622]  You know, and I'll now be accused for, you know, saying that I believe the war on terror is good.
[00:57:42.682 --> 00:57:43.222]  No, I don't.
[00:57:44.088 --> 00:57:47.210]  So, I mean, really, I don't pull punches.
[00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:54.633]  I turn down a lot of opportunities to have a lot bigger national radio show and to be on hundreds and hundreds of, you know, mainline marquee stations.
[00:57:55.253 --> 00:57:59.275]  And I never did that because I try to, you know, not compromise.
[00:57:59.435 --> 00:58:02.037]  But then I get up here on air and I really am who I am.
[00:58:02.057 --> 00:58:03.718]  I say what I believe.
[00:58:04.058 --> 00:58:05.919]  I don't calculate what I'm going to say before I say it.
[00:58:05.959 --> 00:58:08.920]  I just do the research and then go in the air.
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:10.781]  And I don't pull punches.
[00:58:11.599 --> 00:58:17.264]  And no, I don't think Israel runs the whole world, and I don't think all... I mean, some people think Israel's behind everything.
[00:58:18.065 --> 00:58:21.327]  And I know those people are wrong, because they said a lot of things about me that I know are wrong.
[00:58:21.928 --> 00:58:23.890]  And I don't think the Catholic Church is behind everything either.
[00:58:25.071 --> 00:58:29.374]  I mean, the corrupt people are behind it.
[00:58:30.155 --> 00:58:38.242]  And the leadership of all these major groups, of the big central banks, and of the Protestants, and of the Catholics, and of a lot of the Jewish groups,
[00:58:39.551 --> 00:58:40.451]  And the Russian leaders.
[00:58:40.471 --> 00:58:41.071]  They get together.
[00:58:41.091 --> 00:58:46.133]  The Communist Chinese, you know, are a lot of them are on the payroll of Rupert Murdoch.
[00:58:46.173 --> 00:58:47.773]  And he loves working with command and control.
[00:58:48.054 --> 00:58:54.315]  Only got a few people to buy off over there to run his programs that are pro-Communist Chinese when aired inside China.
[00:58:54.736 --> 00:58:57.056]  And he acts like a conservative patriot here in the U.S.
[00:58:58.337 --> 00:58:58.997]  I mean, it's evil.
[00:58:59.257 --> 00:59:04.378]  There was evil oppression in China 5,000 years ago before a Catholic or a Jew ever stepped foot there.
[00:59:04.698 --> 00:59:06.359]  Before Catholics and Jews even existed.
[00:59:07.651 --> 00:59:14.956]  Jews have been around about 3,000 years, and Catholics have been around about 1,800-1,900 years.
[00:59:16.037 --> 00:59:19.640]  You really can't call it Catholics until the Byzantine Empire, so let's say 1,500 years.
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:21.921]  Or no less, that'd be 600 years.
[00:59:22.622 --> 00:59:25.824]  So, I don't even know what to say to you here.
[00:59:26.024 --> 00:59:28.006]  I mean, I really do study history.
[00:59:28.166 --> 00:59:29.787]  I really do go off the facts.
[00:59:31.869 --> 00:59:36.011]  You know, you say I'm not talking about Israel, and I go, yeah, I am, I just did.
[00:59:36.452 --> 00:59:38.212]  You go, oh, don't try to put words in my mouth!
[00:59:38.413 --> 00:59:39.093]  Don't try that!
[00:59:39.153 --> 00:59:39.993]  I've assessed you!
[00:59:40.454 --> 00:59:42.355]  Well, don't you want to have a legitimate debate with me?
[00:59:43.535 --> 00:59:44.036]  I mean, listen.
[00:59:45.516 --> 00:59:48.878]  All these other talk show hosts in the Patriot Movement basically fail.
[00:59:49.278 --> 00:59:49.959]  I mean, basically.
[00:59:49.979 --> 00:59:51.059]  I mean, compared to me, they're failures.
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:53.120]  I don't like that.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:58.023]  I want to have a lot of people taking action, a lot of people having victories, a lot of people out there saying what I'm saying.
[00:59:59.130 --> 01:00:04.516]  But they can never do it because they get into the infighting or they buy into the peer pressure.
[01:00:04.556 --> 01:00:05.577]  I mean, you get it immediately.
[01:00:05.857 --> 01:00:08.660]  Hey, you better say it to this one group or this other group immediately.
[01:00:08.901 --> 01:00:21.294]  And we've tracked that back to a lot of feds who want to make it racial or ethnic or religious because then they can pigeonhole you and keep you from having a Big Ten approach that's going to defeat the New World Order.
[01:00:22.535 --> 01:00:23.896]  The New Old Order's got a Big Ten approach.
[01:00:23.916 --> 01:00:30.962]  They get all the top guys and they're together and they all combine their forces and their wealth to further dominate the population and further squeeze us.
[01:00:31.703 --> 01:00:35.266]  Very important point, though, that he brought up because it gave me a chance to talk about this.
[01:00:36.247 --> 01:00:37.508]  And I'm up against the clock now.
[01:00:37.528 --> 01:00:39.770]  I've taken one call and I need to keep taking more.
[01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:41.051]  Do I have time to jam one more in here?
[01:00:42.152 --> 01:00:44.134]  Let's go ahead and take somebody else who disagrees.
[01:00:44.994 --> 01:00:46.776]  You're on the air, John, from New York.
[01:00:46.816 --> 01:00:47.136]  Go ahead.
[01:00:48.624 --> 01:00:53.727]  I disagree that aliens aren't controlling the world and basically the New World Order folks.
[01:00:54.207 --> 01:00:55.948]  Oh, I forgot that one.
[01:00:56.609 --> 01:01:02.272]  There's also thousands of people that are mad because I don't believe that eight foot reptoid blood drinkers run things.
[01:01:02.853 --> 01:01:08.156]  And I'm also criticized, there are websites that believe I'm actually a five trillion year old Draco.
[01:01:08.869 --> 01:01:12.470]  And I'm not a five-billion-year-old or trillion-year-old Draco.
[01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:17.432]  I'm not a Zionist, and I'm not a Catholic co-agitator or something, whatever they call it.
[01:01:17.792 --> 01:01:18.072]  Okay?
[01:01:18.132 --> 01:01:20.753]  I'm just a guy from Texas fighting the New World Order.
[01:01:21.153 --> 01:01:24.294]  And I cover serious... Is this a joke phone call?
[01:01:24.554 --> 01:01:25.775]  You just called in to say I'm stupid?
[01:01:25.795 --> 01:01:26.275]  No, no, no.
[01:01:26.935 --> 01:01:28.936]  Okay, because I've never seen a flying saucer.
[01:01:29.276 --> 01:01:30.556]  I'm not into flying saucers.
[01:01:30.856 --> 01:01:32.457]  I cover real serious issues, sir.
[01:01:33.467 --> 01:01:36.069]  If you look at Phil Snyder, though, that guy was talking about all this.
[01:01:36.209 --> 01:01:38.331]  Aliens, underground bases, and then they killed him.
[01:01:38.671 --> 01:01:42.454]  So I would understand why you wouldn't talk about it, but, you know, this is what I'm saying.
[01:01:42.494 --> 01:01:45.616]  I think that there is something that we don't see that is physical.
[01:01:45.716 --> 01:01:47.938]  You know, I interviewed that fellow before he died.
[01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:49.118]  People, you know, do die normally.
[01:01:49.579 --> 01:01:52.161]  And he was saying he psychically knew where all these bases were.
[01:01:52.581 --> 01:01:53.802]  I appreciate your call.
[01:01:54.582 --> 01:01:55.923]  Again, this is what these people do.
[01:01:56.104 --> 01:01:56.544]  But again,
[01:01:57.239 --> 01:02:00.142]  A lot of folks just watch football, punch out, go drink a beer.
[01:02:00.802 --> 01:02:02.964]  They just deny anything's going on.
[01:02:02.984 --> 01:02:04.385]  There's no corruption, everything's fine.
[01:02:04.766 --> 01:02:08.789]  They won't even believe that there's a double set of books in county and city government.
[01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:19.479]  Then you've got the other people, though, who just constantly sit around fighting with each other in any type of truth movement about whether it's aliens or Jews or Catholics writing things.
[01:02:20.894 --> 01:02:24.398]  It's evil people, folks, combining their forces together in a new world order.
[01:02:24.598 --> 01:02:28.421]  You go cover a globalist meeting like Bilderberg or CFR like I have, there's everybody.
[01:02:28.441 --> 01:02:32.385]  There's black people, there's Arabs, there's white guys, there's Jews, there's Russians.
[01:02:33.206 --> 01:02:33.847]  It's a mafia.
[01:02:34.087 --> 01:02:38.711]  It's a global mafia meeting together who own the private banks that print and issue the money.
[01:02:38.752 --> 01:02:41.895]  I'm going to come back, blast some more of your calls, get to all the other news.
[01:02:42.435 --> 01:02:43.816]  PrisonPlanet.com is the website.
[01:02:43.836 --> 01:02:44.177]  Stay with us.
[01:02:55.834 --> 01:03:01.296]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:01.677 --> 01:03:09.320]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:03:10.006 --> 01:03:17.047]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:03:17.447 --> 01:03:28.909]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:03:29.189 --> 01:03:32.750]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:35.090]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:39.251]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:03:52.761 --> 01:03:53.702]  Ted Anders for Midas.
[01:03:53.742 --> 01:03:53.922]  June 29, 2007.
[01:03:53.982 --> 01:03:56.204]  Gold 64950 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $670.65, $330.95 per half, $165.48 per quarter.
[01:03:56.224 --> 01:03:56.744]  That's $670.65, $330.95, and $165.48.
[01:03:56.784 --> 01:04:00.067]  70% of China's one trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[01:04:00.087 --> 01:04:02.068]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:02.548]  Bad news for U.S.
[01:04:02.568 --> 01:04:02.769]  currency.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.961]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[01:04:21.121 --> 01:04:22.562]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[01:04:22.802 --> 01:04:24.903]  Dollars fall into 65% of euro.
[01:04:25.023 --> 01:04:26.103]  Erosion accelerates.
[01:04:26.283 --> 01:04:28.805]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of U.S.
[01:04:29.005 --> 01:04:30.885]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[01:04:31.086 --> 01:04:33.567]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:34.727]  Why attack Iran?
[01:04:34.867 --> 01:04:37.869]  Jerome O'Coursey's Iran leads attack against the U.S.
[01:04:37.909 --> 01:04:39.369]  dollar document spells it out.
[01:04:39.489 --> 01:04:41.510]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:45.432]  The value of your hard-earned money is being destroyed in a global game of chess.
[01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:49.093]  Call 800-686-2237 for courses report today.
[01:04:49.213 --> 01:04:49.593]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:04:49.613 --> 01:04:58.655]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[01:04:59.175 --> 01:05:00.956]  Sure, you've got a mortgage and credit cards.
[01:05:01.256 --> 01:05:04.397]  Your debt creation is probably the smartest thing you've ever done.
[01:05:04.837 --> 01:05:06.457]  How would it be to find $75,000, $150,000, $200,000 or more you never knew you had?
[01:05:09.824 --> 01:05:14.267]  Now the task force has strategies to make these debts into virtual savings accounts.
[01:05:14.807 --> 01:05:17.149]  Ben Franklin said, a penny saved is a penny earned.
[01:05:17.769 --> 01:05:26.235]  By doing nothing more than you're doing right now, because you've used your credit, the right strategies can make the debt part of your financial life the smartest thing you've ever done.
[01:05:26.775 --> 01:05:29.477]  Oh, by the way, your strategies cost you nothing out of pocket.
[01:05:30.118 --> 01:05:32.920]  Go ahead and check out the debt elimination scams if you'd like to.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:37.903]  You wouldn't take money from a loan shark, so you may not want to give your money to a debt shark.

[01:05:52.628 --> 01:05:55.349]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[01:05:55.789 --> 01:06:01.471]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally, without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[01:06:01.951 --> 01:06:04.091]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[01:06:04.271 --> 01:06:15.015]  These toxins enter our bodies, and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body, with more than 500 vital functions.
[01:06:16.235 --> 01:06:24.522]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with Live52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.
[01:06:24.862 --> 01:06:27.564]  And it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.
[01:06:27.924 --> 01:06:35.250]  Live52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol and prescription medications.
[01:06:35.610 --> 01:06:38.311]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:07:04.008 --> 01:07:05.989]  Raging for the truth.
[01:07:06.049 --> 01:07:08.151]  Exposing corruption.
[01:07:08.251 --> 01:07:11.173]  Dismantling a false left-right paradigm.
[01:07:11.673 --> 01:07:13.254]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.895 --> 01:07:18.098]  I'm in here acting stupid for the studio audience, as I normally do.
[01:07:18.118 --> 01:07:21.680]  Alright, let's just blast through coals if it's possible for me to do that.
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.942]  That means turtle speed.
[01:07:25.362 --> 01:07:27.404]  Accelerate to tortoise speed!
[01:07:28.164 --> 01:07:30.386]  Let's go ahead and get to some folks for holding the longest.
[01:07:31.153 --> 01:07:36.035]  Let's talk to Mike in Southeast Texas.
[01:07:36.516 --> 01:07:37.916]  You're on the air.
[01:07:38.016 --> 01:07:38.737]  Thank you for holding.
[01:07:39.157 --> 01:07:41.178]  Alex, thank you for taking my call, sir.
[01:07:41.218 --> 01:07:41.738]  How are you doing?
[01:07:41.818 --> 01:07:42.439]  Great, thanks for calling.
[01:07:42.459 --> 01:07:42.759]  What's going on?
[01:07:42.779 --> 01:07:44.820]  You all getting through the floods okay?
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.281]  Luckily, I live on high ground, but folks are dying.
[01:07:47.301 --> 01:07:49.262]  They still try to cross high water crosses.
[01:07:49.302 --> 01:07:49.882]  Not too smart.
[01:07:50.202 --> 01:07:50.583]  Yes, sir.
[01:07:50.623 --> 01:07:51.943]  Well, I'm glad you're okay.
[01:07:52.303 --> 01:07:52.844]  Two things.
[01:07:53.304 --> 01:07:59.487]  I was just watching the network news, and despite the fact of the two so-called small attacks in London,
[01:08:00.223 --> 01:08:03.208]  And they're stepping up security checkpoints all over the United States.
[01:08:03.588 --> 01:08:07.795]  Michael Chertoff says he sees no reason to raise the terror alert.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.782]  Which is, they're confusing people, is what they're trying to do.
[01:08:11.203 --> 01:08:14.465]  Well, they also just train you to put up with anything and everything they do.
[01:08:15.366 --> 01:08:24.293]  I mean, I have documents where the Feds admit that they are training us how to basically be slaves with these checkpoints at airports, you know, which mean nothing.
[01:08:24.334 --> 01:08:34.342]  Bomb experts have said it would take like six hours to make a liquid explosive, it would stink, you'd have to do it in private, that there's no such thing as these liquid bombs they're talking about.
[01:08:34.642 --> 01:08:37.044]  It's just a new way to train you how to be a slave.
[01:08:37.284 --> 01:08:45.049]  Now they have police checkpoints out on the streets that are federally funded, randomly looking for terrorists, but they let illegal aliens go when they catch them.
[01:08:45.369 --> 01:08:46.129]  Catch and release.
[01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:48.271]  And the borders are wide open.
[01:08:48.391 --> 01:08:49.191]  It is a fraud.
[01:08:49.271 --> 01:08:49.912]  It is a joke.
[01:08:50.372 --> 01:08:54.155]  And I want to give you an instance where the HPD is definitely out of control.
[01:08:54.235 --> 01:08:55.856]  Last week I witnessed this myself.
[01:08:56.456 --> 01:08:59.938]  I was near a traffic light and I saw these two guys pull over for the police.
[01:08:59.958 --> 01:09:01.019]  They were African Americans.
[01:09:01.459 --> 01:09:02.200]  They didn't resist.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:03.961]  And these two thug cops
[01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:07.355]  Drove them out of the car and bashed their head against the hood.
[01:09:07.795 --> 01:09:08.335]  No reason!
[01:09:08.495 --> 01:09:09.595]  Well, they deserve that.
[01:09:09.616 --> 01:09:11.456]  I mean, you know, maybe they're with Al-Qaeda.
[01:09:12.116 --> 01:09:13.777]  No, the Houston cops are legendary.
[01:09:13.797 --> 01:09:15.617]  They're probably the worst we've got in Texas.
[01:09:15.897 --> 01:09:16.477]  That's terrible.
[01:09:16.678 --> 01:09:22.319]  And, hey, I mean, they admitted they framed, what, over 4,000 people and then no one was even prosecuted?
[01:09:22.599 --> 01:09:31.982]  I mean, they would just randomly plant drugs on you and randomly have it certified as drugs and it's just, you know... I mean, look, when a country goes bad, the cops go bad, and there is no doubt
[01:09:32.806 --> 01:09:36.287]  Uh, that, uh, especially for minorities, because I've seen it, folks.
[01:09:36.988 --> 01:09:47.992]  I mean, I mean, they treat, well, I mean, there's the famous case of the federal judge, he was black, jogging in his own neighborhood, and they run up and tackle him and grab him and beat him up and take him to jail, and it turned out, of course, he lived in the neighborhood.
[01:09:48.012 --> 01:09:52.334]  Uh, and, uh, yeah, I feel sorry for black folks in, uh, in Houston.
[01:09:52.574 --> 01:10:00.537]  But it's bad, I mean, I've just asked a cop, I pulled up, what was it, it was down there last year, there was a cop, it was a black cop and two white cops,
[01:10:01.055 --> 01:10:05.278]  And there was really bad traffic on the side street, and I was just stopped as I rolled past them.
[01:10:05.318 --> 01:10:06.819]  I said, officers, is this the right way?
[01:10:06.839 --> 01:10:07.819]  And they're like, what?
[01:10:08.279 --> 01:10:10.041]  Well, just get a map!
[01:10:11.261 --> 01:10:14.603]  See, they're not public servants anymore down there, folks.
[01:10:14.623 --> 01:10:16.224]  And they're like that in New York, too.
[01:10:16.485 --> 01:10:17.285]  What?
[01:10:17.305 --> 01:10:18.706]  Get up against the wall there!
[01:10:18.906 --> 01:10:21.728]  You think I'm the public work agency information bureau?
[01:10:22.068 --> 01:10:25.190]  I was talking to an Austin cop that happened to a few months ago.
[01:10:25.905 --> 01:10:33.390]  The Austin cop was there arresting one of my employees because he had an expired license, and the cop was laughing, going, yeah, I'm retiring next month, so I don't care, but the country's gone.
[01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:33.910]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:37.352]  Yeah, we're told we have to arrest him because his driver's license is expired.
[01:10:37.793 --> 01:10:39.354]  I go, but an illegal alien, you wouldn't have to.
[01:10:39.394 --> 01:10:40.254]  He goes, yeah, that's right.
[01:10:40.274 --> 01:10:41.355]  They don't encourage us to.
[01:10:41.575 --> 01:10:42.656]  The judge just lets them go.
[01:10:42.676 --> 01:10:44.637]  Yeah, that's why I'm glad I'm out of here.
[01:10:44.877 --> 01:10:46.058]  Yeah, I got a rock band.
[01:10:46.118 --> 01:10:48.720]  I was playing up for Intel up in New York.
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:50.541]  Yeah, I get paid a lot to go play up there with my rock band.
[01:10:51.001 --> 01:10:55.084]  And I asked an officer, hey, sir, is this the way to the center?
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:58.102]  And the cop almost basically assaulted him.
[01:10:58.142 --> 01:10:59.343]  I said, oh, so you've experienced that?
[01:10:59.363 --> 01:11:01.464]  And he's like, yeah, it's wrong, but I'm glad I'm out of here.
[01:11:01.484 --> 01:11:02.025]  It doesn't matter.
[01:11:02.045 --> 01:11:03.386]  The country's gone.
[01:11:03.406 --> 01:11:05.648]  It was just basically, you know.
[01:11:06.509 --> 01:11:08.150]  And now, yeah, I'm arresting your employee.
[01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:11.293]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is a two-tier system, you know.
[01:11:13.074 --> 01:11:15.796]  Oh, God, we're just, it's, we're in trouble.
[01:11:16.297 --> 01:11:17.858]  Oh, but Al-Qaeda's gonna get us.
[01:11:17.918 --> 01:11:19.680]  I mean, give me a break, folks.
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:21.201]  400 times more likely to die in a car.
[01:11:22.102 --> 01:11:23.022]  Averaging the 9-11 attacks in.
[01:11:26.772 --> 01:11:33.376]  Without those numbers added, it's just astronomical, the chances of being... You have a better chance of being struck by lightning twice than being killed by Alciada.
[01:11:34.877 --> 01:11:36.398]  Let's take more calls here.
[01:11:37.198 --> 01:11:40.140]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:42.221]  I'm trying to look at who's been holding along us.
[01:11:42.742 --> 01:11:44.943]  Let's talk to Joe in Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:11:46.004 --> 01:11:47.565]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:11:47.625 --> 01:11:47.965]  Go ahead.
[01:11:48.625 --> 01:11:49.566]  Alex, how are you doing?
[01:11:49.786 --> 01:11:50.106]  Good.
[01:11:50.646 --> 01:11:50.907]  Good.
[01:11:50.967 --> 01:11:52.187]  Newsflash from Atlanta.
[01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:54.329]  The U.S.
[01:11:54.489 --> 01:11:56.350]  Social Forum just had their
[01:11:57.153 --> 01:11:58.334]  We're good to go.
[01:12:19.864 --> 01:12:20.305]  Really?
[01:12:20.345 --> 01:12:21.826]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:12:21.866 --> 01:12:22.626]  She's gone public.
[01:12:22.907 --> 01:12:31.493]  Michael Moore, and it's a big deal to have Michael Moore last week, one of our cameramen did a great job in New York for WeAreChange.org.
[01:12:32.053 --> 01:12:38.198]  Yeah, we got this whole social forum, activists from all kinds of causes to support this.
[01:12:38.378 --> 01:12:39.299]  Yeah, I understand that part.
[01:12:39.699 --> 01:12:41.240]  Tell folks specifically what they said.
[01:12:42.141 --> 01:12:45.784]  Well, it's a fairly long resolution.
[01:12:46.853 --> 01:12:48.894]  That's the city of Atlanta?
[01:12:48.994 --> 01:12:49.934]  I mean, let's be clear about it.
[01:12:50.254 --> 01:12:51.334]  What does the resolution say?
[01:12:51.394 --> 01:12:51.955]  Who passed it?
[01:12:51.975 --> 01:12:52.415]  What happened?
[01:12:53.075 --> 01:12:53.675]  Well, the U.S.
[01:12:53.735 --> 01:12:57.416]  Social Forum passed this.
[01:12:58.217 --> 01:12:59.237]  I can read the whole thing to you.
[01:12:59.297 --> 01:13:02.378]  No, no, just tell us who they are, sir, and what it says, in a nutshell.
[01:13:02.398 --> 01:13:16.282]  Well, what it is, is it's an international social forum started in Brazil in, I believe, 2003, that because people in all kinds of countries are not getting a voice in their governments, or not getting a voice at all,
[01:13:17.356 --> 01:13:24.381]  Well, that's really exciting.
[01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:25.182]  I've heard of the group.
[01:13:25.482 --> 01:13:26.383]  Send me some info.
[01:13:27.043 --> 01:13:31.787]  My point is, Michael Moore went public and said 9-11 could be an inside job a week and a half ago.
[01:13:32.128 --> 01:13:38.553]  Now, to have this mainline liberal start doing that means that the mainline liberal establishment is in trouble.
[01:13:39.213 --> 01:13:44.738]  And folks, once the liberals find out government's behind terror, they're going to find out Bill Clinton was involved in Oklahoma City.
[01:13:45.222 --> 01:13:47.684]  And then the whole house of cards comes coming down on this.
[01:13:48.846 --> 01:13:49.466]  And it's simple.
[01:13:49.526 --> 01:13:57.954]  If we don't expose the fact that there's government-sponsored terror, governments are going to continue to stage terror and we're going to lose lives and our liberty as a result of these hyped-up hoaxes.
[01:13:58.535 --> 01:14:03.560]  When you see big buildings blowing up and turning into powder, and you see NORAD standing down, that's inside job.
[01:14:04.306 --> 01:14:10.251]  Now, when you see idiots that can't even get fuel tanks to blow up, driving around like a bunch of morons, that is not an inside job.
[01:14:10.651 --> 01:14:12.292]  That is the real deal.
[01:14:12.332 --> 01:14:16.516]  Now, it may be somebody provocateuring and funding them and commanding them, and that's generally the case.
[01:14:17.076 --> 01:14:21.660]  But regardless, government is using these attacks to fearmonger and take liberties.
[01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:27.133]  An EU expansion, England being absorbed into the EU, is wildly unpopular.
[01:14:27.173 --> 01:14:30.454]  Over 90 percent, it was over 80, now it's over 90 percent, are against it.
[01:14:30.674 --> 01:14:44.380]  Gordon Brown's first act is to try to keep this in place, what Blair did is he left, and so now everybody's rallying around Brown with his primitive, you know, rally around the Chief when we get attacked, and now that's all smokescreen, the fact that England is being absorbed.
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:48.762]  Just like this amnesty deal that fell last week, which Kennedy says he'll be back with next month.
[01:14:50.203 --> 01:14:51.183]  Why are they so upset?
[01:14:51.243 --> 01:14:52.583]  It's the North American Union.
[01:14:52.623 --> 01:14:54.964]  The North American Union ID card is in there.
[01:14:55.304 --> 01:14:57.244]  Not just for illegal aliens, but for citizens.
[01:14:57.624 --> 01:15:00.105]  Then they're going to selectively enforce and the illegals aren't going to have it.
[01:15:01.225 --> 01:15:02.725]  It doesn't build one mile of fence.
[01:15:02.765 --> 01:15:06.066]  It legalizes aggravated felons, rapists, child molesters.
[01:15:06.106 --> 01:15:06.766]  That's in the bill.
[01:15:07.066 --> 01:15:08.547]  Five years of tax amnesty.
[01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:09.867]  No income tax for these people.
[01:15:10.367 --> 01:15:11.167]  It's in the bill.
[01:15:15.488 --> 01:15:16.188]  It's amazing.
[01:15:18.043 --> 01:15:22.546]  I don't like it anymore.
[01:15:24.027 --> 01:15:26.809]  My friends, when we get back, I'll jam in a few more calls.
[01:15:27.509 --> 01:15:34.934]  And then I need to get into these globalist quotes about what they plan to do to us, the attack on free speech that's happening, and yes, chemtrails.
[01:15:35.755 --> 01:15:36.676]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:15:37.076 --> 01:15:45.021]  Stay with us out of the studios of News Radio 590K LBJ, syndicated on AM and FM's across the country, and on shortwave and the internet at prisonplanet.com.
[01:15:45.042 --> 01:15:45.602]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:52.626 --> 01:15:55.388]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[01:15:55.728 --> 01:16:02.691]  Since January of 2006, RxDrugCard.com members have saved an average of $33 per prescription filled.
[01:16:02.811 --> 01:16:04.191]  That's over 46% savings!
[01:16:04.591 --> 01:16:06.852]  The average savings for generic drugs was over 71%.
[01:16:08.653 --> 01:16:17.175]  RxDrugCard.com is the only major discount prescription drug plan that offers a price lookup page so you can get an idea of your discounted price before you enroll.
[01:16:17.375 --> 01:16:20.735]  RxDrugCard.com is for anyone who pays for their own prescriptions.
[01:16:20.936 --> 01:16:25.716]  There are no age restrictions, all prescriptions are covered, and 95% of all pharmacies in the U.S.
[01:16:25.736 --> 01:16:29.837]  participate, including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS Pharmacy, and many more.
[01:16:30.157 --> 01:16:34.678]  With RxDrugCard.com, you will save immediately with no messy forms or paperwork.
[01:16:34.978 --> 01:16:36.959]  Membership fees start at only $4.50 per month.
[01:16:38.459 --> 01:16:38.820]  We're good.
[01:16:53.201 --> 01:16:58.424]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:16:58.584 --> 01:17:06.668]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:17:06.928 --> 01:17:15.433]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[01:17:15.933 --> 01:17:21.417]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:17:21.597 --> 01:17:26.681]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:17:26.801 --> 01:17:35.688]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:17:35.948 --> 01:17:40.732]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium

[01:17:52.992 --> 01:17:54.753]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:17:54.873 --> 01:17:56.134]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:17:56.354 --> 01:17:59.176]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:17:59.556 --> 01:18:02.318]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:18:02.858 --> 01:18:09.602]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:18:44.124 --> 01:18:44.404]  That's 877-873-9626.
[01:18:52.393 --> 01:18:52.793]  Attention!
[01:18:52.913 --> 01:18:55.714]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[01:18:56.015 --> 01:19:00.316]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:19:00.636 --> 01:19:01.317]  Listen closely.
[01:19:02.277 --> 01:19:09.420]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:16.183]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity,
[01:19:16.363 --> 01:19:18.484]  Energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[01:19:18.804 --> 01:19:24.306]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[01:19:24.586 --> 01:19:33.989]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[01:19:34.249 --> 01:19:39.893]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[01:19:40.074 --> 01:19:43.636]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[01:19:43.876 --> 01:19:47.159]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[01:19:47.179 --> 01:19:48.300]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:49.501]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:20:03.948 --> 01:20:07.030]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[01:20:07.791 --> 01:20:10.193]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.957 --> 01:20:17.118]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we've got two segments left.
[01:20:17.178 --> 01:20:19.560]  I've got a lot of stuff I want to cover in the meantime.
[01:20:21.702 --> 01:20:26.366]  You know, Ed and Elaine Brown have finally gotten national attention all over CNN, Good Morning America, Fox News.
[01:20:26.386 --> 01:20:28.347]  I don't have to introduce you too much.
[01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:32.731]  They're folks that are mad that a private banking system controls the IRS and
[01:20:33.937 --> 01:20:38.420]  ...is trying to take their home and property, so they said they're going to fight to the death to defend it.
[01:20:39.561 --> 01:20:42.964]  And they had Ron Paul on Fox News this week, and Cabuto was going, what'll run the government?
[01:20:43.224 --> 01:20:44.325]  You're against all taxes?
[01:20:44.365 --> 01:20:46.426]  And Ron Paul said, how'd they build the Capitol?
[01:20:46.466 --> 01:20:47.567]  I'm here, sitting in.
[01:20:48.604 --> 01:20:49.764]  This was built hundreds of years ago.
[01:20:49.784 --> 01:20:51.044]  We didn't have the income tax until 1913.
[01:20:51.164 --> 01:20:53.665]  It wasn't more than 2% until the 1950s.
[01:20:54.965 --> 01:20:59.166]  Not one red cent, as Ronald Reagan's report put out, of the income tax goes around the country.
[01:20:59.186 --> 01:21:01.886]  It goes all to private banks for interest on the debt.
[01:21:02.246 --> 01:21:03.107]  Learn that, folks.
[01:21:03.587 --> 01:21:04.387]  Learn it, okay?
[01:21:04.907 --> 01:21:11.008]  The reason I brought up Ed Brown, Edwin Brown, is we got Mike calling from Rhode Island.
[01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:12.308]  You're on the air, Mike.
[01:21:12.328 --> 01:21:12.868]  What's going on?
[01:21:12.908 --> 01:21:13.808]  You're talking about the Browns.
[01:21:14.348 --> 01:21:14.889]  Yes, I am.
[01:21:14.929 --> 01:21:15.949]  How's it going today, Alex?
[01:21:15.969 --> 01:21:16.189]  Good.
[01:21:16.249 --> 01:21:16.749]  Quickly, sir.
[01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:17.209]  Make your point.
[01:21:17.921 --> 01:21:26.688]  Well, I just went up to visit him for the second time a couple weeks ago, just after the botched Federali raid, when they wanted to kill Ed Milleen Brown.
[01:21:26.888 --> 01:21:27.148]  Sure.
[01:21:28.069 --> 01:21:31.252]  And, uh, they seem to be doing, you know, well, as well as can be.
[01:21:31.272 --> 01:21:32.092]  The spirits are up.
[01:21:32.593 --> 01:21:34.294]  Had a good time with us, spent about five minutes.
[01:21:34.334 --> 01:21:37.657]  But my screen says Christians arrested, so I skipped over a bunch of people to go to you.
[01:21:37.677 --> 01:21:38.137]  What happened?
[01:21:38.898 --> 01:21:40.099]  Oh, you didn't hear about that yet?
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.681]  Okay, uh, protesting pastor's jailed.
[01:21:43.962 --> 01:21:45.443]  Signs wider than torsos.
[01:21:46.278 --> 01:21:46.659]  Uh, St.
[01:21:46.699 --> 01:21:52.832]  Petersburg, Florida officials made good on their plan to limit free speech at the city's homosexual festival this weekend.
[01:21:53.365 --> 01:21:55.686]  By arresting 5 Christians for carrying signs.
[01:21:55.866 --> 01:22:02.870]  Oh my God, you know in Philadelphia they arrested more than 20 people, charged 7 of them with 47 years of peace.
[01:22:03.490 --> 01:22:05.911]  It had to go to a court above that for it to get thrown out.
[01:22:06.191 --> 01:22:08.552]  And they said protesting is now a felony.
[01:22:09.173 --> 01:22:12.874]  They were praying, the police said that was illegal and a hate crime.
[01:22:13.395 --> 01:22:14.975]  And you're saying now they've done that in St.
[01:22:15.016 --> 01:22:15.816]  Petersburg, Florida.
[01:22:16.036 --> 01:22:17.877]  And again folks, even if you're not a Christian,
[01:22:18.456 --> 01:22:22.259]  The point is, if we don't have free speech for one group, we have it for nobody.
[01:22:22.359 --> 01:22:23.520]  I will definitely check into this.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:24.000]  What happened?
[01:22:25.341 --> 01:22:30.365]  They stepped outside the officially designated protest area.
[01:22:30.525 --> 01:22:35.688]  Which, again, the government, we always had this right before, but now they just announced that you don't have this right.
[01:22:36.009 --> 01:22:37.049]  It's gotta be challenged.
[01:22:37.069 --> 01:22:38.090]  This is disgusting.
[01:22:38.771 --> 01:22:41.353]  And, well, hey, New York now is just banning all filming.
[01:22:41.393 --> 01:22:43.714]  I've already had cops come up and say you're not allowed to film anywhere in the city.
[01:22:44.135 --> 01:22:45.075]  Central Park, anywhere.
[01:22:45.095 --> 01:22:46.056]  They just say, no, you're not allowed to.
[01:22:46.076 --> 01:22:47.377]  And I go, First Amendment?
[01:22:47.938 --> 01:22:50.379]  Freedom of the Press, I'm going to have to litigate, and they back off.
[01:22:50.639 --> 01:22:53.559]  But they arrest American Spectator writers, AP reporters.
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:23:00.601]  Now the city just says we're going to issue a regulation out of our bureau saying you can't do it, New York Times.
[01:23:01.081 --> 01:23:01.942]  Total bull!
[01:23:02.422 --> 01:23:04.902]  Again, this is government engaging in tyrannical behavior.
[01:23:05.323 --> 01:23:10.524]  Hillary, Boxer, all of them have gone on TV saying, yes, they want to restrict talk radio and free speech.
[01:23:10.544 --> 01:23:11.304]  They've done it before.
[01:23:11.624 --> 01:23:14.385]  Then when we resist it, they say it's a conspiracy, it doesn't exist.
[01:23:14.952 --> 01:23:16.515]  Just like they said, amnesty didn't exist.
[01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:21.563]  See, it's military deception tactics they use of just denying what they're doing.
[01:23:23.346 --> 01:23:27.513]  And then, yes, I have other news around the country where they're arresting protesters, you name it.
[01:23:27.774 --> 01:23:28.756]  We have to fight this.
[01:23:29.457 --> 01:23:30.657]  And we have to litigate this.
[01:23:31.097 --> 01:23:41.020]  I'm going to New York on September 11th, I'm going to have my video cameras out wherever I want, and I'm going to tell the cops, listen, I know they tell you and they tell the public you can't be sued personally, I'm going to sue you for civil rights violations.
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:47.402]  And I'm going up there, and I believe me, I don't want to be arrested, I don't want to spend the money doing it, but I will go up there and I am going to cover it, I'm going to do whatever I want.
[01:23:47.802 --> 01:23:50.903]  This is a free country, this is not China or Russia.
[01:23:51.423 --> 01:23:59.987]  By the way, I was just talking to one of my writers, Paul Watson, who went to China for two weeks to write reports about the Internet and censorship, and he found out that was all accurate and true.
[01:24:00.367 --> 01:24:07.711]  But he said getting in and out of the country was easier than getting into the U.S., and he said that he got less harassment videotaping than he got in England or the U.S.
[01:24:08.811 --> 01:24:10.592]  See, I mean, this is not freedom, folks.
[01:24:11.012 --> 01:24:18.816]  They're putting cameras all over the place on us, but then telling us we can't have cameras on them, because more and more police are getting caught acting like complete psychopaths on tape.
[01:24:19.557 --> 01:24:22.259]  Okay, we're not your slaves, we're not your property, get it through your heads.
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.222]  Let me jam in one more here.
[01:24:26.843 --> 01:24:30.686]  Let's talk to Bob in Kentucky.
[01:24:30.706 --> 01:24:31.527]  You're on the air, Bob.
[01:24:32.467 --> 01:24:33.368]  I disagree with you.
[01:24:33.869 --> 01:24:35.510]  I don't think that there is a new world order.
[01:24:36.951 --> 01:24:38.793]  I don't believe that there is a new world order.
[01:24:38.833 --> 01:24:43.717]  I think that you've made this all up, and I think that you are probably part of the folks that are planting bombs in the buildings.
[01:24:44.857 --> 01:24:45.978]  Is this a joke phone call?
[01:24:46.339 --> 01:24:46.559]  No.
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:49.121]  So you think I'm Al-Qaeda?
[01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:49.950]  Yes.
[01:24:50.290 --> 01:24:51.210]  Well, no.
[01:24:51.691 --> 01:24:56.472]  I think that you're very smart, and that you were probably one of the folks planting bombs up in the buildings.
[01:24:57.612 --> 01:25:06.555]  Because, I mean, you said it was going to happen, and you were right, and it happened, and I don't see any information of anybody else knowing, but you do.
[01:25:06.855 --> 01:25:10.136]  So, I mean, how do I know you weren't one of the folks planting bombs up in the buildings?
[01:25:11.297 --> 01:25:12.497]  I mean, you're talking about bombs.
[01:25:13.331 --> 01:25:14.793]  You know, and I saw bombs coming there.
[01:25:14.813 --> 01:25:16.354]  You know, I saw it coming down.
[01:25:16.655 --> 01:25:19.137]  And you're probably part of the folks putting bombs in the buildings.
[01:25:19.258 --> 01:25:27.747]  Now, I, on record, did launch Operation Expose the Government Terrorists, and I said the government would probably attack the World Trade Center in the next few months and blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[01:25:28.368 --> 01:25:31.251]  And they did indeed do that, and I did indeed on radio and TV do that.
[01:25:31.915 --> 01:25:33.757]  And I thank the ADL.
[01:25:33.797 --> 01:25:36.679]  They even wrote a report about my crazy prediction, and of course it happened.
[01:25:36.879 --> 01:25:42.083]  But even a separate group that isn't friendly towards me even admitted that I had said that.
[01:25:42.343 --> 01:25:47.407]  So that is enshrined on record that I did do that.
[01:25:48.087 --> 01:25:54.192]  So why would, if I was the terrorist, why would I say, stop them, don't carry out the attack on the World Trade Center?
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:59.221]  It was just a disinformation ploy, probably.
[01:25:59.361 --> 01:26:00.482]  You're very smart, Mr. Jones.
[01:26:00.642 --> 01:26:06.624]  Okay, so why would I, and how would I, who can barely balance my check, by the way, how would I carry out the attacks?
[01:26:06.664 --> 01:26:09.425]  How would I get the security to let me put bombs in both buildings?
[01:26:10.490 --> 01:26:11.891]  I don't know, but you do.
[01:26:11.951 --> 01:26:14.012]  Yeah, you don't know, I knew.
[01:26:14.612 --> 01:26:22.075]  I knew, sir, because I studied this continually, and I know the Feds cooked the bomb and trained the drivers that attacked the World Trade Center in 93, New York Times.
[01:26:22.555 --> 01:26:34.220]  And I had sources in government and out of government, and I'd done thousands, I mean, I was studying intently at that time, and I also saw preconditioning on the news saying, we're going to get hit by terrorists, when we get attacked, we're going to give up all our rights.
[01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:37.613]  Okay, and I saw them pre-positioning Bin Laden as the boogeyman.
[01:26:37.873 --> 01:26:42.098]  And I saw their preparatory psychological inoculation and preparation.
[01:26:43.399 --> 01:26:45.942]  And it would take hours to go through all of that analysis.
[01:26:46.603 --> 01:26:48.505]  But, uh, it's just unbelievable.
[01:26:49.546 --> 01:26:50.287]  There you go, folks.
[01:26:50.307 --> 01:26:51.388]  You'll do anything to love the government.
[01:26:52.970 --> 01:26:55.412]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:26:55.472 --> 01:26:56.433]  Larry in California.
[01:26:56.453 --> 01:27:00.036]  Again, I'm skipping past all these other great callers, the folks that disagree, because that's our rule.
[01:27:00.496 --> 01:27:04.720]  Unlike other mainstream shows that censor you out if you disagree and won't let you on.
[01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:05.961]  We encourage that.
[01:27:06.342 --> 01:27:07.122]  Larry, you're on the air.
[01:27:07.142 --> 01:27:07.503]  Go ahead.
[01:27:07.883 --> 01:27:08.684]  That's right, sir.
[01:27:08.744 --> 01:27:11.626]  Thank you for accepting my call there, Mr. Jones.
[01:27:12.387 --> 01:27:19.513]  And I totally disagree with you by what you say, because you say on the one hand
[01:27:20.017 --> 01:27:25.240]  The police are our enemies, and on the other hand, you say, but there's a lot of good police officers.
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:29.722]  You know, hey, hey, dude, hey, you can't fool me, dude.
[01:27:30.222 --> 01:27:37.106]  You're a great, you're a great, uh, huckster and circus showman.
[01:27:37.126 --> 01:27:40.387]  You know, you like, oh, the pending doom.
[01:27:40.468 --> 01:27:43.129]  You better buy my products now.
[01:27:43.809 --> 01:27:49.092]  You better buy my advertisers products now because the world's about ready to collapse.
[01:27:49.867 --> 01:27:51.527]  No, sir, I disagree with you.
[01:27:52.648 --> 01:27:53.908]  I totally disagree with you.
[01:27:53.968 --> 01:27:54.968]  Okay, I understand.
[01:27:55.068 --> 01:27:58.069]  I understand you now to form a sentence and repeat that over and over again.
[01:27:58.089 --> 01:27:58.829]  America's a great country.
[01:27:58.869 --> 01:28:00.230]  Number one, how much have you been drinking?
[01:28:01.170 --> 01:28:01.650]  Hey, sir.
[01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:03.290]  Put him on hold for a minute.
[01:28:03.310 --> 01:28:03.991]  I want to go back to him.
[01:28:04.571 --> 01:28:04.831]  Okay.
[01:28:07.191 --> 01:28:12.613]  The World Banking Regulatory Body, the International Bank of Settlements.
[01:28:12.973 --> 01:28:14.033]  Type into Google.
[01:28:15.593 --> 01:28:17.134]  What was that exact headline this week?
[01:28:20.515 --> 01:28:29.138]  Just type World Depression into Google News and you'll get the London Telegraph AP Reuters Wall Street Journal.
[01:28:29.818 --> 01:28:31.979]  I may be able to find it during the break and read you the actual headline.
[01:28:32.399 --> 01:28:33.660]  I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:34.660]  I hope that doesn't happen.
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:45.284]  If we address who's behind this and who's behind the ballooning of the dollar, lowering its value, the 13.6 per annum inflation we're under,
[01:28:47.879 --> 01:28:51.602]  Then they may back off, but the International Bank of Settlements just came out.
[01:28:51.702 --> 01:28:56.205]  Also, banks are now calling in commercial and home loans, coast-to-coast and worldwide.
[01:28:57.305 --> 01:29:07.252]  There's a massive debt bubble, so when I do get on air and say there's serious financial problems could erupt in the next couple years, even sooner, that's because that is the International Bank of Settlements.
[01:29:08.353 --> 01:29:09.513]  I hope that isn't the case.
[01:29:12.835 --> 01:29:14.076]  It's just, I wish I had another hour.
[01:29:15.117 --> 01:29:16.478]  I mean, I'd have this going on for like an hour.
[01:29:18.052 --> 01:29:19.173]  You just blow my mind.
[01:29:20.973 --> 01:29:22.954]  My videos are for free on Google Video.
[01:29:22.974 --> 01:29:25.455]  Now, you can buy high-quality DVDs of them at Infowars.com.
[01:29:25.516 --> 01:29:25.996]  I hope you do.
[01:29:26.336 --> 01:29:29.938]  Why can the media and the government... Government makes you pay them taxes.
[01:29:29.978 --> 01:29:31.999]  I just make films and say, if you'd like to buy them, you can.
[01:29:32.039 --> 01:29:32.739]  If not, they're free.
[01:29:33.379 --> 01:29:37.321]  So, that's a false idea that I'm not allowed to pay my staff and make money.
[01:29:38.322 --> 01:29:38.562]  Okay?
[01:29:38.582 --> 01:29:41.003]  I mean, I talk about serious issues, sir.
[01:29:41.703 --> 01:29:43.764]  So, again, you try to... That's an ad hominem attack.
[01:29:43.804 --> 01:29:45.245]  We'll be right back and...
[01:29:46.443 --> 01:29:47.863]  I got a bunch of other news I want to cover.
[01:29:47.903 --> 01:29:48.844]  It's Catch-22.
[01:29:48.864 --> 01:29:52.705]  Stay with us.
[01:29:52.805 --> 01:29:56.866]  People who use Cartabite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:29:57.066 --> 01:30:00.487]  For over five years, Cartabite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:30:00.647 --> 01:30:04.168]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cartabite.
[01:30:04.388 --> 01:30:07.709]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:30:07.789 --> 01:30:12.010]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we
[01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:13.511]  We're good to go.
[01:30:30.189 --> 01:30:34.651]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:30:34.711 --> 01:30:36.092]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:30:36.232 --> 01:30:40.074]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:30:40.174 --> 01:30:40.974]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[01:30:53.044 --> 01:30:55.646]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:56.046 --> 01:31:01.029]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:01.389 --> 01:31:03.130]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:08.193]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:08.473 --> 01:31:09.393]  How much do you want?
[01:31:09.614 --> 01:31:10.354]  When do you want it?
[01:31:10.734 --> 01:31:12.335]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:12.615 --> 01:31:13.456]  When will you need it?
[01:31:13.696 --> 01:31:15.757]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:15.897 --> 01:31:16.997]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:17.238 --> 01:31:18.578]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:18.758 --> 01:31:23.821]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:24.021 --> 01:31:27.163]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:27.603 --> 01:31:31.106]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:31.426 --> 01:31:32.427]  How much will you need?
[01:31:32.647 --> 01:31:33.268]  We don't know.
[01:31:33.548 --> 01:31:34.469]  How much do you want?
[01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:35.410]  All you can get.
[01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:36.431]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:39.453]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:39.733 --> 01:31:41.735]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:41.755 --> 01:31:42.416]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:52.914 --> 01:31:55.916]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:31:56.217 --> 01:32:01.160]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:05.764]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:32:06.044 --> 01:32:14.970]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:32:15.170 --> 01:32:18.793]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:32:19.073 --> 01:32:24.103]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:32:24.404 --> 01:32:31.117]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:32:31.607 --> 01:32:32.268]  What about you?
[01:32:32.908 --> 01:32:38.273]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:32:38.333 --> 01:32:39.414]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:32:39.494 --> 01:32:41.396]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:58.682]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:32:58.922 --> 01:33:00.663]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:33:00.944 --> 01:33:07.227]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:33:07.527 --> 01:33:13.630]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:33:13.891 --> 01:33:19.914]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[01:33:20.194 --> 01:33:26.620]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:30.303]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:33:30.603 --> 01:33:34.306]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:33:34.506 --> 01:33:37.029]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:33:37.169 --> 01:33:39.531]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:33:39.691 --> 01:33:41.993]  For more information call Biosolutions toll free.
[01:33:42.073 --> 01:33:42.333]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:33:42.373 --> 01:33:42.573]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:33:42.593 --> 01:33:42.713]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:33:42.753 --> 01:33:43.634]  You're listening to GCN.
[01:33:43.694 --> 01:33:46.275]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:33:46.295 --> 01:33:48.195]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:48.215 --> 01:33:49.136]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:11.511 --> 01:34:12.172]  Alright, here's the deal.
[01:34:12.192 --> 01:34:14.673]  I got a five-minute chemtrail report from NBC News.
[01:34:14.773 --> 01:34:16.414]  It's up on prisonplanet.com.
[01:34:16.894 --> 01:34:24.899]  Where they get the government to admit, well, when you just spray the atmosphere with aluminum to keep you safe from the rays of the sun that's heating up to stop global warming.
[01:34:24.999 --> 01:34:28.221]  By the way, the sun is heating up to record levels they've never before recorded.
[01:34:29.061 --> 01:34:30.442]  They've only been recording for 200 years.
[01:34:30.462 --> 01:34:34.765]  I don't know if I have the time to play this, because I promised to read all these famous globalist quotes.
[01:34:35.605 --> 01:34:36.606]  I do my show tomorrow.
[01:34:37.346 --> 01:34:37.766]  Love it, too.
[01:34:37.786 --> 01:34:39.147]  I think I'll just start the show with a lot of this.
[01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:42.571]  It makes my head spin.
[01:34:43.791 --> 01:34:46.853]  You know, people say, well, you make up the stuff you talk about.
[01:34:46.973 --> 01:34:55.178]  I go off bills, legislation, law reports, industry publications, and mainstream news, but I advertise all the information that's out there.
[01:34:55.198 --> 01:34:58.961]  I mean, I got quotes from David Rockefeller about how he wants to enslave you and your family.
[01:34:59.241 --> 01:35:00.441]  These are from books he published.
[01:35:00.882 --> 01:35:04.784]  He published a book in 2003, calling for the end of the U.S.
[01:35:04.904 --> 01:35:06.045]  I mean, I have the quotes.
[01:35:06.125 --> 01:35:07.205]  I own his book.
[01:35:07.266 --> 01:35:11.188]  I mean, Trey, you work in my office as a radio producer for the weekday show,
[01:35:11.741 --> 01:35:13.302]  You bring me a lot of the news and stuff.
[01:35:14.402 --> 01:35:18.544]  I mean, for people out there, I don't even ask you to believe me.
[01:35:18.904 --> 01:35:23.126]  Go check out the claims I'm making, but instead you just go, no, you're a liar.
[01:35:23.466 --> 01:35:24.326]  I believe the government.
[01:35:24.366 --> 01:35:25.107]  Trey, you want to comment?
[01:35:25.387 --> 01:35:31.789]  Yeah, I was just saying, you know, the first thing someone always asks me when they find out where I work is if I believe everything that they tell me.
[01:35:31.809 --> 01:35:33.230]  I was like, well, of course I do, because
[01:35:33.843 --> 01:35:41.874]  For one, I'm pulling 15% or so of the news articles and I pull them out of the New York Times, Reuters, Washington Post.
[01:35:41.934 --> 01:35:45.920]  I mean, you know, we're not searching through, you know, backwoods snuff newspapers.
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:50.186]  I was on a national radio show last year when they had all the illegal alien marches.
[01:35:50.828 --> 01:36:00.121]  And I went on air and I said the Dallas Morning News reporter, Rob Allen and co, that ran the presidential campaign of Asante Fox and Bush's first run, staged these.
[01:36:00.201 --> 01:36:01.542]  And they went, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:36:01.562 --> 01:36:03.145]  And I went, I got the article right here!
[01:36:03.205 --> 01:36:05.568]  I mean, it's just that we know what we're looking for!
[01:36:06.448 --> 01:36:10.411]  We are not, by any means, we are not digging far to find stuff.
[01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:11.531]  Yeah, that's the problem!
[01:36:11.611 --> 01:36:15.233]  I mean, how many days do I have like a hundred articles and I cover five of them?
[01:36:15.274 --> 01:36:18.916]  Ladies and gentlemen, all you have to do is read the newspaper because that's all we do where we work.
[01:36:18.956 --> 01:36:20.116]  We just read the newspaper.
[01:36:20.336 --> 01:36:21.077]  Here's an example.
[01:36:21.477 --> 01:36:24.619]  I mean, around the office we go, yeah, my cousin's a cop, yeah, there are a lot of good cops.
[01:36:24.659 --> 01:36:27.801]  God, look at this video of this cop beating up an 11-year-old girl for no reason.
[01:36:28.021 --> 01:36:29.522]  Yeah, that exactly explains it.
[01:36:29.542 --> 01:36:34.665]  I mean, because that guy goes, well, one hand you say the cops are out of control, the other hand you still say, well, there's still some good cops.
[01:36:34.926 --> 01:36:40.309]  Yeah, the system's gone, the government's totally corrupt, but we're saying don't blame each and every individual cop.
[01:36:40.469 --> 01:36:44.572]  But you're too drunk, or too stupid, to understand the difference, buddy.
[01:36:44.872 --> 01:36:47.954]  I'm so freaked out, I'm thinking about getting my family out of this country.
[01:36:48.934 --> 01:36:49.896]  I love America!
[01:36:50.377 --> 01:36:51.298]  I'm freaked out!
[01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:56.347]  Look, I got Professor Carl Quigley, the head of the Georgetown Political Science Department.
[01:36:56.768 --> 01:36:59.373]  He was the top consultant for the formation of NASA.
[01:37:00.575 --> 01:37:02.238]  Okay, with Werner Von Braun and Goddard.
[01:37:03.012 --> 01:37:06.434]  This guy was Bill Clinton's mentor who he thanked in his first State of the Union.
[01:37:06.714 --> 01:37:11.337]  Okay, I own his actual 1,500 page book, Tragedy and Hope, where he bragged about all this.
[01:37:11.538 --> 01:37:13.539]  Okay, I got page after page of these quotes.
[01:37:13.659 --> 01:37:14.619]  I can't read all these.
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:15.860]  This is one guy.
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:17.962]  There are millions of pages of these people.
[01:37:18.002 --> 01:37:18.422]  I'm serious.
[01:37:18.702 --> 01:37:24.646]  Hundreds of books, hundreds of articles that I've read myself, where they say they're going to enslave us and take over.
[01:37:25.026 --> 01:37:28.769]  Well, you know, people want to call in and try to tell us that we're pulling fake news.
[01:37:29.129 --> 01:37:32.531]  And the CIA just released the Fannie and Jules documents that document
[01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:40.514]  You know, most of the stuff you talked about from, you know, assassination attempts on Castro, I mean, it's documented material that they've released.
[01:37:40.554 --> 01:37:43.596]  They admit that our government planned to hijack jets and fly them into buildings!
[01:37:43.636 --> 01:37:46.018]  I mean, I don't know what else, it's CIA.gov!
[01:37:46.118 --> 01:37:49.340]  Literally admitted on paper, 702 pages.
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:50.881]  Look, look, right here.
[01:37:51.662 --> 01:37:52.902]  Here's a quote from Carol Quigley.
[01:37:53.563 --> 01:37:56.024]  Okay, this is one of the top globalists, okay?
[01:37:56.445 --> 01:37:57.005]  Listen to this.
[01:37:57.325 --> 01:38:01.168]  There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international anglophile network
[01:38:01.673 --> 01:38:05.554]  Which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical right believes, the communist act.
[01:38:05.855 --> 01:38:13.337]  In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Roundtable groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the communists, and any other groups, and frequently does so.
[01:38:13.757 --> 01:38:21.720]  I know of its operations of this network, because I have studied it for twenty years, and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960s, to examine its papers and secret records.
[01:38:22.501 --> 01:38:28.503]  I have no aversion to it, or most of its aims, and have, for much of my life, been close to many of its instruments.
[01:38:29.483 --> 01:38:33.064]  I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies.
[01:38:33.504 --> 01:38:39.785]  In general, my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.
[01:38:40.025 --> 01:38:41.726]  Page 950, Tragedy and Hope.
[01:38:42.286 --> 01:38:49.067]  He goes on in here to talk about what we already knew, that the British funded Hitler to build him up, to tear up Europe, so they could take over.
[01:38:49.647 --> 01:38:50.548]  Now, I already know that!
[01:38:50.768 --> 01:38:53.848]  That's mainstream history, but here he is talking about how it's good!
[01:38:55.549 --> 01:38:56.689]  No, it's not good!
[01:38:57.768 --> 01:38:58.410]  Here's another one.
[01:38:58.852 --> 01:39:02.183]  The argument the two parties, now this is for all you liberals and conservatives.
[01:39:02.443 --> 01:39:03.928]  They're laughing at you, okay?
[01:39:05.265 --> 01:39:05.685]  Page 1247.
[01:39:06.085 --> 01:39:17.490]  The argument that the two parties should represent opposite ideals and policies, one perhaps to the right and the other to the left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrine and academic thinkers.
[01:39:18.110 --> 01:39:28.114]  Instead, the two parties should be almost identical so that the American people can, quote, throw the rascals out at any election without leading to any profound or extreme shifts in policy.
[01:39:28.743 --> 01:39:30.044]  This is written back in the 60s.
[01:39:30.364 --> 01:39:37.531]  He's saying, we got both parties, you little academics and the rest of you go around and argue about how many angels can dance on the head of a pen all day.
[01:39:37.851 --> 01:39:42.195]  Look, George Bush is going to leave office and all those martial law powers are going to be Hillary's.
[01:39:43.095 --> 01:39:46.979]  When Clinton left office, George Bush blocked Dan Burton's committee from going after Clinton.
[01:39:48.766 --> 01:39:49.667]  It's staged, folks!
[01:39:49.747 --> 01:39:50.828]  I've got more quotes here.
[01:39:50.888 --> 01:39:51.328]  Listen to this.
[01:39:51.348 --> 01:39:54.330]  The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim.
[01:39:54.831 --> 01:40:02.777]  Nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands, able to dominate the political systems of each country and the economics of the country as a whole.
[01:40:03.037 --> 01:40:06.800]  The system was to be controlled in a feudalist... That means slavery, folks.
[01:40:08.041 --> 01:40:12.945]  ...feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world, acting in concert by secret agreements.
[01:40:12.985 --> 01:40:13.526]  Arrived at.
[01:40:13.866 --> 01:40:15.267]  Just type Carroll quickly into Google.
[01:40:16.149 --> 01:40:19.350]  And then don't sit there when you read it off news sites and think it's not true.
[01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:26.432]  You get up off your hind end, you go to the Austin Public Library, they got two copies there last time I checked, and you go read it!
[01:40:28.532 --> 01:40:31.413]  Don't you sit there and shoot your mouth off at me anymore!
[01:40:32.874 --> 01:40:34.674]  I got more quotes, I got hundreds of them.
[01:40:35.294 --> 01:40:35.814]  Right here.
[01:40:38.195 --> 01:40:42.776]  National Socialism will use its own resolution for establishing a new world order.
[01:40:44.237 --> 01:40:44.877]  Adolf Hitler.
[01:40:46.129 --> 01:40:49.371]  President George Bush, September 11, 1990, State of the Union Address.
[01:40:49.812 --> 01:40:54.995]  Out of these troubled times, a new world order can emerge under the United Nations that performs as envisioned by its founders.
[01:40:56.196 --> 01:40:57.137]  There's one quote here from H.G.
[01:40:57.157 --> 01:40:58.698]  Wells saying that they're going to kill everybody.
[01:40:58.738 --> 01:40:59.859]  I don't have time to read that.
[01:41:00.179 --> 01:41:04.002]  We are not going to achieve a new world order without paying for it in blood as well as in words and money.
[01:41:04.362 --> 01:41:08.305]  Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Foreign Affairs, CFR Publication, June-August, Issue 95.
[01:41:09.767 --> 01:41:10.347]  Listen to this one.
[01:41:10.608 --> 01:41:12.449]  Today, America would be outraged if U.N.
[01:41:12.469 --> 01:41:14.510]  troops entered Los Angeles to restore order.
[01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:16.371]  Tomorrow, they will be grateful.
[01:41:16.671 --> 01:41:28.459]  This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence, and that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil.
[01:41:28.699 --> 01:41:34.703]  The one thing every man fears is the unknown, but presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished.
[01:41:35.819 --> 01:41:39.582]  For the guarantee of their well-being, granted to them by their world government.
[01:41:39.902 --> 01:41:43.965]  Released minutes of the 1991 Bilderberg Conference, Evian, France.
[01:41:45.546 --> 01:41:48.748]  If this were a dictatorship, it would be a heck of a lot easier, just so long as I'm the dictator.
[01:41:48.768 --> 01:41:51.350]  George W. Bush, December 18, 2000, CNN.
[01:41:52.111 --> 01:41:54.573]  Here's Ted Turner, an interview for Audubon Magazine.
[01:41:54.913 --> 01:42:00.497]  A world population of 250 to 300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels would be ideal.
[01:42:01.164 --> 01:42:01.864]  Here's another quote.
[01:42:02.104 --> 01:42:08.166]  In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly virus in order to contribute something to solve over human population.
[01:42:09.006 --> 01:42:12.547]  That's French News Agency, Deutsch Press, August 1988.
[01:42:13.147 --> 01:42:19.769]  Here is the book he wrote the foreword to, If I Was an Animal, 1986, Robert Clark, LTD.
[01:42:20.269 --> 01:42:24.610]  I must confess that I am tempted to ask for reincarnation as a particular deadly virus.
[01:42:25.362 --> 01:42:25.722]  Here's one.
[01:42:25.762 --> 01:42:27.724]  We're on the verge of a global transformation.
[01:42:28.084 --> 01:42:31.126]  All we need is the right major crisis, and the nations will accept the New World Order.
[01:42:31.587 --> 01:42:38.452]  By the way, where's my... I got a Rockefeller quote here from his book, his autobiography written four years ago, where he says, My goal is to destroy America.
[01:42:38.972 --> 01:42:40.413]  My goal is to bring down the U.S.
[01:42:40.914 --> 01:42:43.996]  I mean, this guy basically owns Chase Manhattan Citibank, okay?
[01:42:44.176 --> 01:42:47.579]  I mean, he writes a best-selling book, saying he's gonna run your life!
[01:42:48.638 --> 01:42:49.918]  He's going to run you into the ground.
[01:42:50.178 --> 01:42:54.480]  You sit around going, I don't believe none of it.
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:56.260]  You just sit there and you love it.
[01:42:57.781 --> 01:42:59.161]  I'm out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:00.561 --> 01:43:02.222]  We're in a red-level crisis.
[01:43:02.262 --> 01:43:05.463]  Let's just go out in the last minute and a half with the NBC chemtrail piece.
[01:43:05.503 --> 01:43:06.383]  You can see it at presentplanet.com.
[01:43:06.403 --> 01:43:08.384]  You can watch the last three minutes at presentplanet.com.
[01:43:08.404 --> 01:43:09.644]  We're going to end the show with this.
[01:43:09.884 --> 01:43:10.244]  Here it is.
[01:43:10.304 --> 01:43:11.125]  Great job to the crew.
[01:43:11.345 --> 01:43:12.145]  See you back next Sunday.
[01:43:12.185 --> 01:43:12.525]  God bless.
[01:43:13.252 --> 01:43:15.973]  The community of the San Bernardino Mountains has a real mystery on its hands.
[01:43:16.013 --> 01:43:23.737]  The official explanation here is that jet contrails are causing strange lines in the sky, and that it's pollen making people sick on the ground.
[01:43:23.797 --> 01:43:29.579]  But others are convinced it is something else, and they ask, is the government experimenting with our weather?
[01:43:29.599 --> 01:43:34.861]  There was a huge duct cloud.
[01:43:35.682 --> 01:43:40.184]  Longtime Cedar Glen resident Gretchen Sherman says she has never seen anything like it.
[01:43:41.855 --> 01:43:44.157]  Oh, it covered the entire Cedar Glen area.
[01:43:45.078 --> 01:43:48.781]  A cloud of dust, leaving a sticky yellow slime all over her car.
[01:43:49.341 --> 01:43:53.784]  It happened again last February, and calls began pouring into the local Alpenhorn newspaper.
[01:43:54.025 --> 01:43:59.789]  They had a tremendous upsurge of children that were not going to school at that time.
[01:43:59.949 --> 01:44:04.973]  Pharmacist Ed Burrows says it is the most mysterious illness he's seen in 22 years on the mountain.
[01:44:05.153 --> 01:44:08.096]  A lot of eye infection problems, upper respiratory problems,
[01:44:08.816 --> 01:44:09.516]  Uh, nosebleeds.
[01:44:10.016 --> 01:44:12.617]  The nearby March Air Force Base say it didn't come from them.
[01:44:13.097 --> 01:44:14.798]  Others said it was a pollen cloud.
[01:44:15.578 --> 01:44:19.379]  The Department of Health found a yellowish tint on a tissue submitted for testing.
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:25.842]  But, quote, there was no sign of any biological form, such as cedar pollen, and the test was ruled inconclusive.
[01:44:26.402 --> 01:44:29.943]  And it wasn't long before things ballooned into a sky-high mystery.
[01:44:30.103 --> 01:44:33.284]  The story is not just here in Crestline in the alleged yellow cloud.
[01:44:33.829 --> 01:44:42.405]  People say the government is up there in airplanes spraying all kinds of chemicals to change or manipulate the weather, leaving what you see there, and they call that a chemtrail.
[01:44:43.084 --> 01:44:47.305]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.
[01:44:47.425 --> 01:44:50.226]  Now you can do even more to your Genesis shows in your area.

[01:45:16.932 --> 01:45:19.773]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:45:20.173 --> 01:45:27.756]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[01:45:27.816 --> 01:45:31.537]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
