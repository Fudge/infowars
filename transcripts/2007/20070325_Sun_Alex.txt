[00:00:03.318 --> 00:00:08.899]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio that will carry you through like no other.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.540]  Strap yourselves in and hold on.
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.021]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:17.261]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:18.622 --> 00:00:21.062]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:21.102 --> 00:00:23.443]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:27.224]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:00:32.794 --> 00:00:37.400]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.165 --> 00:00:42.206]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.447]  It is March 25, 2007.
[00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:48.153]  We're going to be live here for the next few hours.
[00:00:48.554 --> 00:00:49.515]  We're going to have wide...
[00:00:50.538 --> 00:01:04.924]  toll-free number to join us 877-590-5525 or if you're listening in Central Texas to the station that we broadcast out of, News Radio 590 KLBJ, you can call in to the local number at 836-0590.
[00:01:04.944 --> 00:01:15.309]  To all of our sponsors, listeners, affiliates, the great folks running the show there in the control room, thank you all for your support in making this transmission against tyranny
[00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.232]  In defense of the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and our Republic, possible.
[00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.053]  Again, thank you.
[00:01:21.553 --> 00:01:27.938]  The websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:36.905]  I'm Alex Jones, I'm a constitutionalist, I'm a freedom lover, and both parties are bought and paid for by foreign banking interests, by foreign corporations.
[00:01:37.285 --> 00:01:39.627]  The nation has been taken, it has been took,
[00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.582]  It's the oldest trick in history to stage terror attacks as a pretext to destroy your liberties.
[00:01:46.123 --> 00:02:08.056]  While the nation's sovereignty is being dismantled, while our nation's borders are being overrun, while our very fabric is being decimated and incinerated, the government, the corrupt government, is telling you to worry about some foreign enemy or some creature under your bed, and if you don't give them total fealty and support,
[00:02:08.976 --> 00:02:22.941]  Well, we're here to expose the war on terror as a fraud, expose the war on drugs as a lie, and just basically expose the entire system for what it is, a matrix-level lie.
[00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:25.442]  So again, thank you for joining us.
[00:02:26.022 --> 00:02:29.683]  Now, going over just some of the news that we'll be covering in the next two hours,
[00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:38.817]  Ahmed Dinejad is saying they're going to try the Britons for espionage.
[00:02:39.197 --> 00:02:46.699]  The 15 members of the British military captured on a small patrol boat out in the Persian Gulf.
[00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:49.740]  They're close to or inside Iranian waters.
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.640]  There's some argument about that.
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.762]  People are asking, why would Iran do this right now at this key time while these sanctions are being thrown on them?
[00:03:00.077 --> 00:03:07.103]  While they get out of nations, the global government is sitting there preparing for more sanctions, which they've now voted for.
[00:03:07.564 --> 00:03:08.404]  Why would they do this?
[00:03:08.444 --> 00:03:09.705]  Well, we'll try to boil that down.
[00:03:11.227 --> 00:03:13.789]  Also, an interesting story out of the BBC concerning this.
[00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:24.018]  Iran denies UK access to the sailors, but Iran says that they pled guilty to being inside Iranian waters and said that it was a mistake.
[00:03:25.024 --> 00:03:38.523]  And rightfully so, the former head of naval forces for Britain, former ex-Navy Chief Admiral Sir Alan West, said that a confession in such circumstances meant absolutely nothing.
[00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:40.442]  I totally agree.
[00:03:40.502 --> 00:03:44.627]  When people are held by enemy forces, you cannot believe the testimony.
[00:03:44.647 --> 00:03:46.589]  They could have been tortured, they could have been intimidated.
[00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:52.395]  Now, of course, in the past, Americans or Brits would never accept this, but I say now it has to be.
[00:03:52.855 --> 00:04:01.184]  In fact, they could hold those British sailors for four years, publicly torture them, publicly hold their children and threaten to torture them,
[00:04:02.064 --> 00:04:09.550]  And then if the sailors come out and say that they were engaging in espionage, you've got to allow Iran to execute them.
[00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.051]  You've got to do it.
[00:04:11.571 --> 00:04:15.794]  Because if we're going to have those type policies, then we have to accept those.
[00:04:16.275 --> 00:04:20.418]  And when our troops get tortured by foreign lands, we can't say it's bad anymore.
[00:04:20.458 --> 00:04:21.999]  We've got to say it's good.
[00:04:22.617 --> 00:04:26.860]  When Hitler had people tortured, when Mengele tortured, we have to say it's good.
[00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:35.747]  When the North Vietnamese would capture our troops and our airmen and torture them severely for years, we have to now say that that was indeed what the good guys do.
[00:04:36.087 --> 00:04:37.068]  Because we're America.
[00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:38.329]  We're the good guys.
[00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.331]  Jack Bauer tortures every night on Fox.
[00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:52.621]  Alberto Gonzales, the Attorney General's real memo, say torturing children is good, and that if people secretly held and tortured for four years, confessing to things that is admitted now they didn't do, so what?
[00:04:52.861 --> 00:04:53.701]  Let's execute them!
[00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:55.523]  So this is the new freedom.
[00:04:56.821 --> 00:04:59.362]  Does that make any sense to people out there, what I'm saying?
[00:04:59.922 --> 00:05:01.642]  Because you can't have your cake and eat it, too.
[00:05:01.682 --> 00:05:05.503]  In fact, you don't have a microphone in front of you in there, Trey.
[00:05:05.523 --> 00:05:06.743]  You want to wheel one over to you?
[00:05:07.583 --> 00:05:11.424]  I know you didn't know you'd be on air right now, but jump across and wheel that around.
[00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:14.605]  I want to get, just randomly, your take in the studio.
[00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:22.267]  Do you see the point I'm making that they've captured these 15 British commandos on a naval vessel that turns out they're from the Army?
[00:05:22.287 --> 00:05:23.187]  One of them's female.
[00:05:23.847 --> 00:05:27.189]  And the former head of the British Navy saying, well, you know, they're held by enemies.
[00:05:27.489 --> 00:05:29.251]  You don't know what coercion they've been under.
[00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:31.692]  This confession means absolutely nothing.
[00:05:31.952 --> 00:05:32.753]  And I agree!
[00:05:33.153 --> 00:05:45.921]  You can't believe that confession, that they were engaged in espionage, or were inside non-territorial waters of Iraq, or really the territorial waters, or the extraterritorial waters of Iran.
[00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:56.729]  So, how do you believe that confession, or how do you throw that out, though, when they can publicly say they tortured someone and threatened his sons, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, for four years?
[00:05:56.829 --> 00:05:57.890]  Now, that was admitted!
[00:05:58.731 --> 00:05:59.692]  Does that make any sense?
[00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:04.362]  Honestly, I don't know what to make of any of it, because I've heard different reports.
[00:06:04.602 --> 00:06:09.686]  The first report I heard was that the people captured had already admitted to being there.
[00:06:10.606 --> 00:06:11.687]  But see, the British and the U.S.
[00:06:11.707 --> 00:06:14.689]  government are saying you can't believe that because they may have been coerced.
[00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.913]  But then when they admit they've coerced somebody and threatened their children, when the U.S.
[00:06:18.973 --> 00:06:20.714]  does that though, we're supposed to believe it.
[00:06:21.517 --> 00:06:23.638]  I understand the contradiction there.
[00:06:24.018 --> 00:06:25.058]  It's a pretty hard one to believe.
[00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:29.579]  But Bush's amnesty plan is not an amnesty, it's just a total amnesty.
[00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:31.380]  It's just lying to us.
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.241]  So basically I'm done talking about that area of Iran.
[00:06:35.581 --> 00:06:38.942]  Embassies in Tehran prepare escape plans.
[00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:40.142]  This is out of the Jerusalem Post.
[00:06:40.622 --> 00:06:45.944]  These are all indicators that the bombardment may start sooner rather than later of the Islamic Republic.
[00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:47.816]  Iran rejects U.N.
[00:06:47.856 --> 00:06:50.178]  vote on arms, financial sanctions.
[00:06:50.978 --> 00:06:53.781]  So we're going to get into this later in the second hour.
[00:06:54.041 --> 00:07:02.408]  I'm going to set this aside in the stack and I'm just going to give you an overview of some of the news we're going to cover when we get back and then we'll go straight to your phone calls.
[00:07:03.511 --> 00:07:05.272]  The IMF has put out a press release.
[00:07:05.312 --> 00:07:06.953]  That's the International Monetary Fund.
[00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:14.116]  That is a private group of banks that lobbied our government about 50 years ago to pay tens of billions into their coffers a year.
[00:07:14.176 --> 00:07:21.580]  And the private banks take your money and invest it in third world nations and leverage out the economies and blow out their economies by design.
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.001]  I've interviewed the former chief economist of the World Bank.
[00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:31.062]  Who released thousands of pages of documents, shows of sticklets, Nobel Prize winner, where they design all this.
[00:07:31.282 --> 00:07:33.623]  But again, these are the owners of the country.
[00:07:33.943 --> 00:07:38.104]  And yes, the owners of you and I and all the rest of us through the new corporate fascist state.
[00:07:38.344 --> 00:07:39.964]  They literally claim ownership of us.
[00:07:39.984 --> 00:07:49.846]  We can just realize that that's happening and decide to resist it or we can just feel like we're free and powerful and swagger around thinking that drinking beer and sticking our bellies out makes us men.
[00:07:51.212 --> 00:07:57.177]  Or fighting for your country and actually knowing what's going on might actually be the better course, but hell, why do you want that?
[00:07:57.397 --> 00:07:58.698]  Why not just be a slave, huh?
[00:07:59.338 --> 00:07:59.839]  I understand.
[00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:03.362]  IMF to urge depreciation in dollar.
[00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:10.367]  The IMF has said that they wish to debase the dollar even further to push the New World Order.
[00:08:10.387 --> 00:08:13.570]  They even, of course, are using those terms like globalization.
[00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:20.135]  And again, for the general public here, you have no idea what that even means because you get your news from Jack Bauer on Fox.
[00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:24.138]  And later we'll get into exactly what that does mean.
[00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:26.761]  Total, absolute treason against this nation.
[00:08:26.821 --> 00:08:30.164]  But, you know, your bank account is being completely devalued.
[00:08:30.184 --> 00:08:32.586]  You should be running around pulling your hair out angry, but you're not.
[00:08:32.606 --> 00:08:33.166]  I understand.
[00:08:33.527 --> 00:08:40.253]  You've been taught to feel like you're on top of everything and just say you're number one and just say it can't happen here and then everything will be alright.
[00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:41.634]  Okay, I'm not going to get cynical today.
[00:08:41.674 --> 00:08:42.615]  I'm already about to start.
[00:08:43.015 --> 00:08:43.876]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:08:44.859 --> 00:08:49.922]  The Democrats have introduced total blanket absolute complete amnesty for all illegal aliens in this country.
[00:08:50.242 --> 00:09:09.072]  Bush is greedily supporting it and most of your neocon so-called conservative talk shows are doing their best to cover this up because if they can just continue the hemorrhaging of our nation's sovereignty a little longer the country will bleed to death and it will be over and they will have victory for their new world order and you will have it publicly announced to you that you're a slave.
[00:09:09.592 --> 00:09:15.181]  And you, out of fear, will say that you suddenly support it because as long as you feel like you're on the winning side, everything's okay.
[00:09:19.773 --> 00:09:22.674]  New documents show Gonzalez lied to Congress criminally.
[00:09:23.075 --> 00:09:23.995]  But again, so what?
[00:09:24.035 --> 00:09:24.775]  Bill Clinton lied.
[00:09:24.795 --> 00:09:25.976]  We've been taught lying's good.
[00:09:26.196 --> 00:09:27.777]  We've taught our children lying's good.
[00:09:28.197 --> 00:09:31.058]  We're a banana republic and we're going to live like that.
[00:09:31.478 --> 00:09:35.260]  So I'll go over his lies to Congress concerning the U.S.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.861]  Attorneys and a lot more.
[00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:40.082]  The websites again are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:09:40.442 --> 00:09:41.182]  Tons of news.
[00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.583]  Your calls all coming up.
[00:09:43.964 --> 00:09:44.464]  Stay with us.
[00:10:00.327 --> 00:10:09.430]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:17.412]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:10:18.109 --> 00:10:25.174]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:10:25.574 --> 00:10:37.021]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:10:37.301 --> 00:10:40.824]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:10:41.264 --> 00:10:43.225]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:10:43.545 --> 00:10:47.388]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:10:47.968 --> 00:10:49.849]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:10:49.869 --> 00:10:54.430]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.670]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:10:56.691 --> 00:10:57.251]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:11:17.691 --> 00:11:22.294]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:11:23.234 --> 00:11:30.478]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:11:31.479 --> 00:11:34.541]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:11:34.781 --> 00:11:40.164]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:11:41.065 --> 00:11:42.405]  Call for your copy today.
[00:11:42.445 --> 00:11:42.645]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:11:45.908 --> 00:11:51.775]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:11:52.235 --> 00:11:52.475]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:11:52.495 --> 00:11:52.816]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:12:05.247 --> 00:12:06.849]  Hi, Steve Schenck, Fearless Task Force.
[00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.133]  Sure, you've got a mortgage and credit cards.
[00:12:09.433 --> 00:12:12.578]  Your debt creation is probably the smartest thing you've ever done.
[00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:14.662]  How would it be to find $75,000, $150,000, $200,000 or more you never knew you had?
[00:12:18.018 --> 00:12:22.441]  Now the task force has strategies to make these debts into virtual savings accounts.
[00:12:23.001 --> 00:12:25.323]  Ben Franklin said, a penny saved is a penny earned.
[00:12:25.963 --> 00:12:34.409]  By doing nothing more than you're doing right now, because you've used your credit, the right strategies can make the debt part of your financial life the smartest thing you've ever done.
[00:12:34.929 --> 00:12:37.651]  Oh, by the way, your strategies cost you nothing out of pocket.
[00:12:38.312 --> 00:12:41.094]  Go ahead and check out the debt elimination scams if you'd like to.
[00:12:41.634 --> 00:12:46.077]  You wouldn't take money from a loan shark, so you may not want to give your money to a debt shark.
[00:12:46.815 --> 00:12:50.358]  For an understanding of what a financial genius you truly are, call 800-409-5633.
[00:12:50.378 --> 00:12:51.199]  On the web, MyDebtFreePath.com.
[00:12:51.219 --> 00:12:51.259]  800-409-5633.
[00:13:01.423 --> 00:13:03.764]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:13:04.024 --> 00:13:06.045]  What was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:13:06.205 --> 00:13:13.229]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:22.033]  The Calbem Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:13:22.433 --> 00:13:27.117]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.

[00:14:12.786 --> 00:14:15.868]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:18.991]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:21.012 --> 00:14:21.953]  Alright, welcome back.
[00:14:22.053 --> 00:14:25.556]  And I know that we've got a lot of folks that are patiently holding.
[00:14:25.576 --> 00:14:27.398]  The toll free number to join us is 877-590-5525.
[00:14:27.458 --> 00:14:28.919]  That's 877-590-5525 or locally here in Central Texas, 836-0590.
[00:14:28.939 --> 00:14:29.179]  Alright.
[00:14:38.283 --> 00:14:41.367]  Instead of getting sarcastic, let me just mention some of the stuff that's coming up.
[00:14:41.847 --> 00:14:55.343]  Back on Monday, up on InfoWars.net, one of my writers, Steve Watson, discovered a YouTube clip of Jim Cramer on this Wall Street Confidential show that was off the internet.
[00:14:57.136 --> 00:14:58.237]  In fact, they were just testing the clip.
[00:14:58.297 --> 00:14:59.058]  You just heard a second of it.
[00:14:59.078 --> 00:15:01.240]  We're going to play it later in the next half hour.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:08.325]  And Jim Cramer's just admitting all the illegal things he did working on Wall Street and how it's just standard operating procedure.
[00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:12.169]  Now, I know this because I've talked to a lot of people high-powered on Wall Street.
[00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:15.071]  I know about this because I've actually studied how the world works.
[00:15:16.452 --> 00:15:18.354]  The Federal Reserve literally cons...
[00:15:20.206 --> 00:15:23.909]  Have the stock market close within a few points of exactly what it wants.
[00:15:24.329 --> 00:15:30.735]  The Chicago Mercantile, the put options, the derivatives.
[00:15:31.235 --> 00:15:41.243]  I mean, there's so many different facets to this, but it's in the tens of trillions every day, and it is more rigged in many cases than a Las Vegas roulette wheel.
[00:15:42.264 --> 00:15:45.607]  And again, I listen to these mainstream financial shows and the rest of it,
[00:15:46.449 --> 00:15:50.351]  And they are literally, I mean you might as well be living in the Matrix.
[00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:52.652]  It is not reality.
[00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:54.633]  It is not reality.
[00:15:55.013 --> 00:16:00.956]  I remember watching CNN back in 1999-2000, hearing how great Enron was.
[00:16:01.357 --> 00:16:10.101]  Now I knew from my sources it was a money laundering front, involved in all sorts of trafficking and offshore money laundering.
[00:16:11.067 --> 00:16:15.128]  We saw them bringing the assets out of it before they blew the company out.
[00:16:15.168 --> 00:16:16.128]  That was all staged.
[00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:20.990]  And then, of course, right after he got convicted, Kinlay had a heart attack and never got sentenced.
[00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.210]  But, of course, everything's fine.
[00:16:23.791 --> 00:16:25.871]  That's small potatoes, okay?
[00:16:26.231 --> 00:16:28.392]  Global Crossing, Enron.
[00:16:29.289 --> 00:16:31.430]  But they don't go after those people to send them to prison.
[00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.911]  No, no.
[00:16:31.931 --> 00:16:37.034]  They go after somebody who got some inside knowledge that her stock might go down so she dumped it.
[00:16:37.534 --> 00:16:38.274]  Martha Stewart.
[00:16:38.314 --> 00:16:40.156]  That's like claiming you're whale hunting.
[00:16:40.576 --> 00:16:49.001]  That's like claiming you're out, you know, going after sperm whales or something and you catch a one-inch sardine and you claim you've got Moby Dick on the deck of your boat.
[00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:53.710]  Or it's like catching a mullet and claiming it's a 20-foot great white shark.
[00:16:54.131 --> 00:16:55.351]  I mean, it's a fraud.
[00:16:55.411 --> 00:16:56.171]  She did nothing.
[00:16:56.631 --> 00:16:57.312]  But that's what they do.
[00:16:57.352 --> 00:17:00.533]  They give you the illusion of their stopping corruption.
[00:17:00.573 --> 00:17:02.674]  The illusion that they're stopping problems.
[00:17:02.714 --> 00:17:06.135]  In fact, I've seen two different articles in the Statesman yesterday.
[00:17:06.995 --> 00:17:10.437]  One that a child sex tourist sentenced.
[00:17:10.957 --> 00:17:14.218]  And it looks like he traveled the world getting videos of child porn.
[00:17:14.478 --> 00:17:14.898]  Horrible.
[00:17:14.938 --> 00:17:15.578]  Send him to prison.
[00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:16.859]  I agree.
[00:17:17.426 --> 00:17:24.408]  But then on the front of the statesman, juvenile terms under scrutiny.
[00:17:25.668 --> 00:17:31.070]  And it admits that... I mean, folks, this has been in the news for years.
[00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.651]  I've interviewed people that worked inside these prisons.
[00:17:34.691 --> 00:17:41.973]  They had a whack-a-hunt prison outside Austin a few years ago they had to shut down because the guards were raping almost all the women systematically.
[00:17:43.092 --> 00:17:44.393]  And videotaping it?
[00:17:44.694 --> 00:17:46.395]  And now this is the Texas Youth Commission.
[00:17:47.116 --> 00:17:53.481]  I mean, I know former jail guards, people that quit and left because it was prostitution, folks.
[00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:54.442]  It wasn't.
[00:17:54.723 --> 00:17:56.344]  They were just raping the children.
[00:17:56.584 --> 00:17:58.426]  Hell, they're selling them out the back door!
[00:18:00.248 --> 00:18:01.689]  3,000 children are missing in Florida.
[00:18:02.069 --> 00:18:13.774]  It was in the news three years ago, you'll never hear about it since, where 3,000 plus kids are missing in Florida, CPS took, and it turned out the top three people that ran the CPS there were convicted child rapists.
[00:18:14.154 --> 00:18:15.515]  I mean, hardcore folks.
[00:18:16.235 --> 00:18:17.175]  Hardcore criminals.
[00:18:17.516 --> 00:18:18.836]  Hardcore abusers.
[00:18:19.877 --> 00:18:21.757]  And so that's how it's going to work, you see.
[00:18:22.037 --> 00:18:22.998]  And it's not going to stop.
[00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:24.398]  The governor's not going to do anything.
[00:18:24.418 --> 00:18:25.339]  They're going to put some
[00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:29.568]  This is what the Founding Fathers explained to everybody, and this is why I'm so upset.
[00:18:30.608 --> 00:18:34.309]  You're going to have criminals, you're going to have degenerates, you're going to have sickos in society.
[00:18:35.329 --> 00:18:38.050]  And it's always going to be a problem, and you've got to deal with it at a local level.
[00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:47.612]  But every time you get big centralized federal or state government, the criminals are going to take that over, and then they're going to carry out their crimes with impunity, and it's called tyranny.
[00:18:47.832 --> 00:18:50.093]  When criminals run government and can't be stopped,
[00:18:52.265 --> 00:18:55.867]  That's called tyranny, and that's more common than liberty and freedom.
[00:18:55.907 --> 00:18:58.148]  In fact, it's hundreds of times more common.
[00:18:58.268 --> 00:18:58.568]  Okay?
[00:18:58.768 --> 00:19:01.109]  It's real simple, and we're going into that right now.
[00:19:01.929 --> 00:19:03.210]  We're going into that right now.
[00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:13.895]  And... No amount of ID cards and Raptor systems, where parents have got to scan in to go into the schools, is going to keep you safe from the predators on the inside.
[00:19:14.255 --> 00:19:18.737]  And those systems are being put in so they can have their way with your children.
[00:19:18.997 --> 00:19:20.298]  Don't you understand that, folks?
[00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:22.612]  And, uh, I didn't mean to get off on this.
[00:19:23.292 --> 00:19:23.973]  This is the problem.
[00:19:24.673 --> 00:19:25.853]  This is the problem with this show.
[00:19:26.534 --> 00:19:28.295]  I do a three-hour syndicated show weekdays.
[00:19:28.395 --> 00:19:29.875]  This is a great two-hour show we're doing.
[00:19:29.895 --> 00:19:30.936]  It needs to go to three hours.
[00:19:30.956 --> 00:19:32.777]  I haven't really pushed for that, but it needs to happen.
[00:19:33.977 --> 00:19:44.142]  Simply because I get in here, and I literally have, let's not exaggerate, 30, 40, I don't know, maybe, you know, it's more than that, probably 40 articles that I want to cover.
[00:19:44.202 --> 00:19:47.684]  I could spend the next two hours on one of these stories.
[00:19:48.599 --> 00:19:52.241]  I could spend the entire show on one of these stories, and I just can't do it.
[00:19:53.842 --> 00:19:56.564]  I have the dollar plunging here, set to plunge even more.
[00:19:56.704 --> 00:20:03.028]  I talk to yuppies, they don't even know what currency value means, but some poor immigrant from Mexico does because they live in the real world.
[00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:05.330]  I mean, this country is just so spoiled.
[00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:09.453]  We had it so good because of our forebearers, and we're just fat, dumb, and happy.
[00:20:10.273 --> 00:20:12.495]  Gonzales should be arrested.
[00:20:12.895 --> 00:20:14.796]  Forget step down immediately.
[00:20:14.856 --> 00:20:15.997]  I have total proof of that.
[00:20:16.684 --> 00:20:21.005]  Caught red-handed with the actual memos, lying to Congress premeditatedly.
[00:20:22.746 --> 00:20:40.131]  Huge news, my Charlie Sheen interview of a year ago, for some reason got back in the news and was on, no exaggeration, eight different Fox TV shows I know of, CNN, every channel, multiple times, MSNBC, CNBC, hundreds of newspapers.
[00:20:40.912 --> 00:20:43.773]  We're getting millions and millions of new readers a day just from this.
[00:20:45.734 --> 00:20:46.635]  Well, we know what happened.
[00:20:46.695 --> 00:21:01.403]  Somebody leaked a New York Post, page six, that indeed, you know, I've mentioned this, but I haven't mentioned Charlie Sheen or Mark Cuban or Mike Berg or any of these people.
[00:21:03.864 --> 00:21:09.867]  I mentioned that I was consulting on Lou Shane's final cut, and it would probably be out in theaters in the next six to eight months.
[00:21:10.168 --> 00:21:11.148]  I missed that a few weeks ago.
[00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:13.549]  But this leaked out.
[00:21:13.589 --> 00:21:14.490]  We know who leaked it out.
[00:21:15.365 --> 00:21:20.907]  And it got leaked to page six, and that broke back on Thursday.
[00:21:21.727 --> 00:21:23.528]  And then it went completely supernova.
[00:21:24.748 --> 00:21:26.429]  That's my term when a story gets really big.
[00:21:27.109 --> 00:21:27.729]  All over the place.
[00:21:27.749 --> 00:21:29.510]  There's a lot of disinfo involved in this.
[00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:32.091]  They're saying Rosie O'Donnell is involved in it.
[00:21:32.131 --> 00:21:33.111]  She's not involved in it.
[00:21:33.491 --> 00:21:36.312]  She just went public on 9-11 being an inside job last week.
[00:21:38.053 --> 00:21:39.273]  And so that finally broke.
[00:21:39.753 --> 00:21:41.994]  And they can't even get people's names right in these articles.
[00:21:42.014 --> 00:21:44.555]  They got my name right, but they got a lot of the other names wrong.
[00:21:45.808 --> 00:21:47.709]  I'm probably going to get Mark Cuban on my show next week.
[00:21:47.729 --> 00:21:50.130]  You also know him as the owner of the Mavericks.
[00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:54.491]  He sold his internet company for $5.7 billion.
[00:21:55.392 --> 00:21:58.553]  But I've known about all this since before Loose Change even got involved.
[00:21:58.833 --> 00:22:01.254]  So later in the next hour, if everybody has time, I'll get into that.
[00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:03.375]  I've got a bunch of clips there.
[00:22:04.463 --> 00:22:05.983]  And then there's a story I want to get into.
[00:22:06.344 --> 00:22:08.444]  This has been laying around my house for a couple months.
[00:22:08.504 --> 00:22:14.006]  It's the December 2006 issue of National Geographic's Saturn As You've Never Seen It.
[00:22:14.326 --> 00:22:17.226]  Now, I don't really have time to read for enjoyment anymore.
[00:22:17.766 --> 00:22:19.267]  I mean, I may steal an hour a week.
[00:22:19.887 --> 00:22:25.188]  So I'm going to eat breakfast this morning, and I pick it up, and I know it's a propaganda magazine.
[00:22:25.208 --> 00:22:26.609]  I wouldn't call it liberal.
[00:22:26.649 --> 00:22:27.329]  I'd call it elitist.
[00:22:28.135 --> 00:22:34.858]  And I go and I sit down and I'm sittin' there eatin' eggs, drinkin' black, hot coffee, and it ruined my black, hot, scaldin' coffee.
[00:22:35.339 --> 00:22:36.739]  Nothin' like it goin' down your throat, is it?
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.501]  And every page is pure evil.
[00:22:40.121 --> 00:22:49.626]  So we're gonna come back, take calls, I'm gonna get into the National Geographic first, after your calls, then I'll get into the Dollar, everything else, PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com are the sites.

[00:22:51.338 --> 00:22:54.179]  The future of our world is very uncertain.

[00:26:00.742 --> 00:26:09.051]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:26:09.271 --> 00:26:11.073]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:26:11.273 --> 00:26:12.474]  That's 1 in 4 adults.
[00:26:12.815 --> 00:26:18.881]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.

[00:27:11.514 --> 00:27:13.994]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:27:16.715 --> 00:27:17.815]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:27:19.594 --> 00:27:23.675]  Waging war on corruption here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:27:23.995 --> 00:27:25.736]  For folks listening on the East Coast, it's 5 to 7.
[00:27:25.896 --> 00:27:28.657]  We're out on the West Coast, 2 to 4 p.m.
[00:27:29.217 --> 00:27:30.677]  I guess Mountain, 3 to 5 p.m.
[00:27:30.717 --> 00:27:31.537]  There are all the time zones.
[00:27:31.857 --> 00:27:32.818]  Okay, let's get to your calls.
[00:27:32.838 --> 00:27:34.158]  They're all over the map, which is fine.
[00:27:34.178 --> 00:27:37.979]  I always love to grab a bag of Becks, spin the wheel of fortune.
[00:27:38.499 --> 00:27:41.140]  Never know which direction you'll take us in.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:47.502]  Let's go ahead and go to line 3 and talk to Chip in Seattle, because it looks like Chip boy likes to disagree.
[00:27:47.522 --> 00:27:48.262]  So go ahead, Chip.
[00:27:48.282 --> 00:27:48.782]  You're on the air.
[00:27:49.548 --> 00:27:51.509]  Hey Alex, it's Chip again from last week.
[00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:53.471]  Yes, you disagreed with what I was saying.
[00:27:53.511 --> 00:27:59.275]  But I figured I'd go ahead and move on a little bit because I was looking forward to your new film that's coming out.
[00:27:59.975 --> 00:28:01.176]  Okay, what's on your mind today, sir?
[00:28:01.817 --> 00:28:12.424]  Well, as an anthropologist, I've been studying eugenics and biometrics for over 20 years and so I'm definitely interested in things like what NIST is working on with the virtual reality and neuromorphic chips.
[00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:15.246]  I would recommend googling how the brain works.
[00:28:15.266 --> 00:28:16.507]  They just recently had a conference.
[00:28:17.248 --> 00:28:18.108]  IBM, the U.S.
[00:28:18.148 --> 00:28:19.009]  military, NIST,
[00:28:19.853 --> 00:28:20.473]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:28:34.582 --> 00:28:48.746]  Humanists say that we won't be able to have jobs or live and we don't join them and that it's wonderful, but really these technologies are universally going to be used out of the gates to subvert and dominate and track and trace humanity.
[00:28:48.806 --> 00:28:53.907]  But you don't have, folks, when you call in, you don't have to tell us what you want to call about.
[00:28:53.927 --> 00:28:58.128]  But if you do give us an idea, they'll type a little line out of the side of your statement
[00:28:59.156 --> 00:29:02.478]  With you, Chip, it says, complain about some of the dumb things I've said.
[00:29:02.979 --> 00:29:04.560]  Yeah, but I would like to say something.
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.101]  Hold on, hold on, but I went to you first.
[00:29:07.282 --> 00:29:10.724]  Last week, did you say that pi was divisible by 33?
[00:29:10.904 --> 00:29:14.927]  No, I remember that on my weekday show.
[00:29:14.947 --> 00:29:17.188]  I was just talking about numbers, and no, I know that's not pi.
[00:29:17.548 --> 00:29:18.249]  It's irrational.
[00:29:18.309 --> 00:29:19.750]  It doesn't divide evenly by any number.
[00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:26.895]  But I also definitely wanted to talk to you a little bit about your, you've been talking about the firefighters a lot lately, too.
[00:29:27.935 --> 00:29:28.736]  Okay, go ahead, sir.
[00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:34.473]  Well, I wondered how much of the work have you done on actually listening to the firefighter's tapes?
[00:29:35.854 --> 00:29:36.775]  I've listened to a lot of them.
[00:29:36.795 --> 00:29:39.679]  I've put clips of firefighter tapes in one of my films.
[00:29:39.739 --> 00:29:41.100]  In fact, in two of my films.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.302]  Martial Law has a lot of it.
[00:29:42.962 --> 00:29:46.506]  Do you have any recommendation as to where to get access?
[00:29:46.567 --> 00:29:48.569]  I've got the 1,200 page oral histories.
[00:29:49.971 --> 00:29:53.893]  There are hundreds of hours that have now been posted online, sir.
[00:29:53.913 --> 00:29:55.474]  Listen, I really appreciate your call.
[00:29:56.275 --> 00:29:57.695]  I've interviewed a lot of firefighters.
[00:29:57.756 --> 00:30:00.277]  I've played clips of other firefighters on other radio shows.
[00:30:00.997 --> 00:30:05.059]  There are just scores of firefighters, police and medical workers and emergency workers.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.841]  So they were told to get back from Building 7 on 9-11.
[00:30:07.881 --> 00:30:09.802]  It was going to be brought down by controlled demolition.
[00:30:10.122 --> 00:30:11.263]  It was, quote, going to blow up.
[00:30:12.063 --> 00:30:13.424]  And that's in my film, Terror Storm.
[00:30:13.484 --> 00:30:14.385]  It's in martial law.
[00:30:14.405 --> 00:30:15.165]  It's part of the record.
[00:30:15.914 --> 00:30:18.536]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[00:30:18.556 --> 00:30:22.519]  Let's talk to TJ in Wisconsin.
[00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:23.600]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.201]  How are you doing today, Alex?
[00:30:25.241 --> 00:30:25.541]  Good.
[00:30:26.002 --> 00:30:26.882]  Thanks for having me on again.
[00:30:27.743 --> 00:30:28.944]  I've got two issues for you today.
[00:30:29.064 --> 00:30:32.727]  One was FOX treatment as a whole, Charlie Sheen, loose change.
[00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:37.106]  They just totally demonized the movement by saying we hate America.
[00:30:37.206 --> 00:30:40.010]  Well, it's so-called fair and balanced, but let's just take O'Reilly.
[00:30:40.351 --> 00:30:48.362]  He had himself, and then the Republican, he works for the Republican Party, and he has contracts for the Royal Saudis to run security, that Diebel character.
[00:30:49.183 --> 00:30:50.104]  Uh, to get up there.
[00:30:50.524 --> 00:30:56.389]  And then, uh, the other guy who's on the payroll of the Democrats, an Al Gorb, and, uh, puts out disinfo campaigns.
[00:30:56.709 --> 00:31:12.721]  So, it's O'Reilly and two people calling us traitors, and five times on the show they said, we're like Hitler, we want to kill Jews, we hate Jews, loose change isn't about Jews, we never talk about Jews, but they just keep saying, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew.
[00:31:12.821 --> 00:31:13.842]  In fact, when they had, uh,
[00:31:14.728 --> 00:31:25.277]  O'Reilly, Friday, had Mark Cuban on his syndicate radio show, and that's up on presentplanet.com, we wrote an article about it, and he starts bringing up this Jew stuff, and Cuban goes, I'm Jewish, what are you talking about?
[00:31:25.538 --> 00:31:27.739]  There's nothing about Jews, they just say, you're Hitler!
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.021]  You deny the Holocaust!
[00:31:29.061 --> 00:31:29.841]  I'm going, what?
[00:31:30.081 --> 00:31:31.663]  This should be illegal, what you're doing!
[00:31:31.963 --> 00:31:36.287]  By the way, Al Gore and others just typed, the Washington Globe came out a few weeks ago,
[00:31:36.687 --> 00:31:41.528]  And said it should be illegal to say human-caused global warming isn't happening.
[00:31:41.568 --> 00:31:47.190]  See, once they get speech laws passed on one thing, then they start moving it to everything else.
[00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:48.490]  Don't debate us!
[00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:49.790]  You hate Jews!
[00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:54.351]  I mean, I feel like America lost the war and we were Germany.
[00:31:54.851 --> 00:32:00.233]  Both my grandfathers were in World War II, but when you get done watching the news, it's like we're all Nazis and we're bad.
[00:32:00.273 --> 00:32:02.093]  I'm an American!
[00:32:02.413 --> 00:32:04.654]  Shut up, Bill O'Reilly, on government payroll!
[00:32:04.874 --> 00:32:06.094]  Just shut your fat mouth!
[00:32:06.903 --> 00:32:08.524]  Well, that's the other stigma they attach to it.
[00:32:08.584 --> 00:32:12.667]  You know, as soon as they put the Holocaust denial in front of anything, they figure people will stay away from it.
[00:32:13.727 --> 00:32:21.732]  Even with the global warming, anyone who speaks out against global warming, saying that it's going to happen with or without us, they're instantly labeled with the Holocaust denial.
[00:32:21.892 --> 00:32:22.473]  Well, that's it.
[00:32:22.513 --> 00:32:24.874]  But, I mean, take the BBC hit piece against me a month ago.
[00:32:25.234 --> 00:32:26.215]  Big BBC special.
[00:32:26.255 --> 00:32:30.858]  It ended with, uh, this is like Holocaust denial, you know, this is like hating Jews.
[00:32:32.219 --> 00:32:44.296]  Every show you see, Popular Mechanics, wherever they're at with these, you know, Hearst Publishing, Government Front Group, in the encyclopedia, total disinfo, Homeland Security's family, right in the article, totally staged, just go research it, folks.
[00:32:44.856 --> 00:32:47.079]  It ends with, we hate Jews and want to kill Jews.
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:48.401]  This is nuts!
[00:32:48.481 --> 00:32:55.286]  It's like, if I complain about my water bill, and I call the city and go, this bill's too big, what, you hate Jews?
[00:32:55.547 --> 00:33:00.871]  Or like, I drive through a hamburger place and my hamburger doesn't have tomatoes on it, and I pull back through and go, can I have tomatoes?
[00:33:00.911 --> 00:33:02.512]  And they go, what, you hate Jews?
[00:33:02.953 --> 00:33:08.557]  Or I fall down and skin my knee, and a little bird lands and says, you hate Jews?
[00:33:08.898 --> 00:33:11.620]  I mean, it's really starting to get insane.
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.741]  I mean it's making, but this is the good news.
[00:33:15.061 --> 00:33:18.342]  I've looked at the big message boards and websites where people are commenting on these stories.
[00:33:18.962 --> 00:33:20.962]  Hundreds of news articles the last three days on this.
[00:33:21.663 --> 00:33:26.584]  And it's all just, we're sick of this, we're tired of this, we know you're, you know, it's not going to work.
[00:33:26.664 --> 00:33:28.485]  Address the facts, address the issues.
[00:33:29.585 --> 00:33:30.905]  We're going to cover that in the next hour.
[00:33:32.086 --> 00:33:36.647]  Let's go ahead now and take a call from Dave in New Jersey.
[00:33:36.667 --> 00:33:37.707]  You're on the air, welcome.
[00:33:38.247 --> 00:33:39.407]  Hey Alex, what's up?
[00:33:39.788 --> 00:33:40.268]  What's up man?
[00:33:42.071 --> 00:33:44.812]  Yeah, MySpace got hacked in, and so did mine.
[00:33:45.512 --> 00:33:49.733]  Well, I mean, by our MySpace accounts getting hacked, I don't even really manage my MySpace account.
[00:33:50.014 --> 00:33:51.234]  I put it up six, eight months ago.
[00:33:51.294 --> 00:33:53.014]  It's got, like, almost 30,000 members.
[00:33:53.695 --> 00:33:59.436]  And it's just nothing but infomercials and crud on there, because I run all these other big websites.
[00:33:59.777 --> 00:34:04.098]  I don't have an employee like I do over the... Oh, you know, I have multiple employees on some of my sites.
[00:34:05.158 --> 00:34:08.219]  I don't have a staff to just sit there and manage that.
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:10.460]  But... Go ahead.
[00:34:13.536 --> 00:34:21.098]  The funny thing is that I keep on hearing that MySpace is more heavily monitored by the NSA than anything.
[00:34:21.118 --> 00:34:21.978]  Is that true?
[00:34:23.138 --> 00:34:23.638]  You know what?
[00:34:23.778 --> 00:34:33.001]  I don't know, but I know that they're taking a lot of the data and information that's there because it's owned by News Corp, which is basically the government, and that is being used to be culled.
[00:34:33.741 --> 00:34:35.622]  There's been a lot of reports on that.
[00:34:36.742 --> 00:34:40.043]  Besides that, it's like they're... You know about...
[00:34:41.328 --> 00:34:47.730]  You know, I'm not trying to throw the site here, I'm just... Documentaries.ws and all these other... You know, the chatroom... No, it's fine, sir.
[00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:48.670]  Go ahead and make your point.
[00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:56.593]  ...invaded by people who are like, oh, anti-Alex, Alex is a... You know, the... What do they call that?
[00:34:57.073 --> 00:34:58.373]  The... Listen, I don't care.
[00:34:58.573 --> 00:34:59.133]  I love it.
[00:34:59.853 --> 00:35:08.116]  I love the fact... Listen, for those that don't know about this, instead of saying, is it true, or are there disinfo agents out there,
[00:35:10.655 --> 00:35:28.007]  The federal government admits they spend billions every year paying for fake news and they have private companies and agencies that create fake grassroots organizations that go lobby and literally finance staged rallies for events.
[00:35:29.093 --> 00:35:32.036]  They have tens of thousands of people on the payroll.
[00:35:32.276 --> 00:35:34.699]  There are thousands of members of the press on the payroll.
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:37.722]  Billions spent just on one program.
[00:35:37.742 --> 00:35:44.670]  I mean, they spent billions just to get Head Start rammed through with reporters being paid to come out and report for it.
[00:35:45.442 --> 00:35:45.802]  Okay?
[00:35:46.382 --> 00:35:48.263]  So, I mean, it's like concentration camps.
[00:35:48.283 --> 00:35:52.205]  People are always saying, my cousin knows somebody who saw a concentration camp.
[00:35:52.725 --> 00:35:55.487]  It's in the Houston Chronicle they're building FEMA camps for citizens.
[00:35:56.247 --> 00:35:59.869]  Just type civilian inmate labor camp program into Google.
[00:35:59.889 --> 00:36:11.654]  You'll get army.mil sub-website, where the Army admits that they've had Americans secretly in camps since the early 1980s, and it was declassified in 96, and they take federal and state prisoners and put them in forced labor camps.
[00:36:12.384 --> 00:36:13.665]  I mean, that's going on right now.
[00:36:14.085 --> 00:36:18.047]  Instead of just always wondering if something's true, go to the actual evidence.
[00:36:18.087 --> 00:36:18.787]  Find out about it.
[00:36:19.567 --> 00:36:27.111]  You know, it's like the National News says there is no North American Union, but in five minutes you can go find out it was signed in 2005 and we're inside it.
[00:36:27.551 --> 00:36:29.152]  A few people like Lou Dobbs will cover it.
[00:36:29.432 --> 00:36:31.213]  But they're counting on you not checking it out.
[00:36:31.533 --> 00:36:32.693]  They treat you like you're dumb.
[00:36:34.194 --> 00:36:36.595]  So that's how it, uh, works.
[00:36:37.922 --> 00:36:40.463]  Alright, we're going to be right back after this quick break.
[00:36:40.924 --> 00:36:41.964]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:36:42.024 --> 00:36:44.805]  We may just suspend calls, because I've got a lot of news I want to cover.
[00:36:45.106 --> 00:36:47.427]  It just doesn't seem... We'll see what happens.
[00:37:01.468 --> 00:37:01.888]  Attention!
[00:37:02.009 --> 00:37:04.811]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[00:37:05.111 --> 00:37:09.414]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:37:09.734 --> 00:37:10.415]  Listen closely.
[00:37:11.075 --> 00:37:18.521]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[00:37:18.821 --> 00:37:27.588]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[00:37:27.908 --> 00:37:30.850]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country,
[00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.411]  No health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[00:37:33.691 --> 00:37:43.154]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[00:37:43.354 --> 00:37:48.976]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.

[00:38:02.432 --> 00:38:04.213]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[00:38:04.514 --> 00:38:07.356]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[00:38:07.856 --> 00:38:10.058]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[00:38:10.698 --> 00:38:18.984]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[00:38:19.465 --> 00:38:20.025]  An example?
[00:38:20.545 --> 00:38:23.387]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[00:38:24.248 --> 00:38:27.030]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:30.673]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[00:38:31.443 --> 00:38:36.644]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[00:38:37.264 --> 00:38:39.964]  Money is not the problem, availability is.
[00:38:40.485 --> 00:38:43.365]  Be careful when food supplies get short, with no future.
[00:38:43.865 --> 00:38:46.265]  Many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[00:38:46.886 --> 00:38:48.966]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633.
[00:38:48.986 --> 00:38:50.026]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:38:50.046 --> 00:38:50.086]  800-409-5633.

[00:41:12.185 --> 00:41:23.229]  Coming to you from the capital of Texas, broadcasting the truth coast to coast and worldwide, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:41:23.289 --> 00:41:30.692]  We're back and we're live, waging war on corruption, crashing through the lies and disinformation!
[00:41:32.912 --> 00:41:33.232]  Man!
[00:41:33.633 --> 00:41:35.633]  Alright, look, I know we've got a lot of phone calls to get to.
[00:41:35.653 --> 00:41:40.715]  I've also got a guest joining us to analyze the latest 9-11 developments, and they're big.
[00:41:42.236 --> 00:41:53.948]  I got all this news on the dollar, the Iran situation, the blanket amnesty program to legalize another 20 plus million illegals, which means curtains for this country that most conservatives are worried about.
[00:41:54.049 --> 00:41:58.113]  Ahmedinejad sneaking around in their closet as a vampiric creature.
[00:41:58.573 --> 00:42:05.316]  Remember that when you were a little kid you'd be walking outside at night to throw something in the trash or something and you'd kind of be scared in the dark and run back in the house?
[00:42:05.436 --> 00:42:08.397]  That's how legitimate the Iran threat is.
[00:42:08.417 --> 00:42:10.658]  The open border thing is absolutely deadly, folks.
[00:42:10.918 --> 00:42:14.920]  Like two semis coming down on a mom and, you know, cross the street with her baby.
[00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:20.017]  On wet streets, on black ice streets, but you're not worried about that, are you?
[00:42:20.037 --> 00:42:25.603]  Just Achmed Dinejit sneaking around in the bushes with huge Nosferatu fangs.
[00:42:26.224 --> 00:42:28.767]  Alright, let me just get to this first, okay?
[00:42:30.669 --> 00:42:32.511]  This morning, I already told the story,
[00:42:34.103 --> 00:42:41.148]  I grew up loving National Geographic, looking at all the pictures and the natives and the wildlife and everything, but I know it's total propaganda.
[00:42:41.168 --> 00:42:46.452]  I remember back in, what, 99, I had an issue of National Geographic, because my grandmother, my whole life, has given it to me.
[00:42:47.433 --> 00:42:48.393]  And so I still get it.
[00:42:48.593 --> 00:42:51.676]  My great, my grandma's still alive, now a great-grandmother of my children.
[00:42:53.157 --> 00:42:55.378]  Why am I covering issues that don't matter to the listeners?
[00:42:55.398 --> 00:42:57.140]  The point is, I have National Geographic.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.821]  Because you'll ask, why do you subscribe to it?
[00:42:58.881 --> 00:42:59.121]  I don't.
[00:43:00.766 --> 00:43:15.001]  And I remember back in 99 seeing an article where it showed UN troops somewhere in the east, it was like Malaysia, guarding a UN biosphere zone with M-16s and it said they would shoot anyone that came in to the environmentally sensitive area.
[00:43:15.501 --> 00:43:17.984]  Now we have UN biospheres here too, 54 of them.
[00:43:19.554 --> 00:43:23.316]  And a whole bunch of other World Heritage Sites, and that's how it's going to be in the near future as well.
[00:43:23.636 --> 00:43:24.916]  We have the official UN documents.
[00:43:24.936 --> 00:43:29.558]  This is where the new enviro-environment crimes are going.
[00:43:30.019 --> 00:43:42.524]  They want to make it a crime to deny global warming is man-made, and that you don't want to pay your global tax, because that threatens the Earth, like threatening the Holocaust does, you know, if you even deny that that happened, which I'm not discussing or debating.
[00:43:42.704 --> 00:43:47.146]  But see, they start with that thought, you can't have that speech, and now it's every other form of speech.
[00:43:48.417 --> 00:43:50.378]  I knew it was propaganda, but I said, I can't help it.
[00:43:51.018 --> 00:43:57.180]  They won't have propaganda about the rings of Saturn and these new, you know, color photos up close of Saturn.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.241]  And it was spectacular.
[00:43:58.281 --> 00:44:03.823]  I spent about 15 minutes reading about the beautiful stranger, Saturn's mysterious come to light.
[00:44:04.743 --> 00:44:06.844]  And then I made the mistake of flipping back to the front.
[00:44:07.364 --> 00:44:12.246]  And I opened it up, and we're videotaping this for the local TV show, so I'll go ahead and show it to the viewers out there.
[00:44:13.249 --> 00:44:17.052]  Uh, and I opened it up to an ad by IBM.
[00:44:17.492 --> 00:44:19.393]  What makes you special is the headline.
[00:44:20.294 --> 00:44:30.941]  And it showed a marker board, white marker board, that showed Central Europe, or actually the Middle East, into Central Europe, Eurasia.
[00:44:34.133 --> 00:44:40.858]  It showed migratory paths, all these arrows going out, and they know people are involved and interested in their genealogy.
[00:44:41.239 --> 00:44:43.280]  Now, I happen to really know what's behind this program.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:46.863]  I happen to be making a film about this, and this is part of the film I'm making.
[00:44:47.904 --> 00:44:49.545]  Twelve-plus years of research.
[00:44:49.605 --> 00:44:55.409]  This is the coup de grace, the creme de la creme of what I've done, the penultimate of my work so far.
[00:44:57.111 --> 00:44:57.791]  The paramount.
[00:44:58.211 --> 00:45:01.974]  And so, why should I even try to read this and explain it to you?
[00:45:01.994 --> 00:45:02.875]  It'll just sound crazy.
[00:45:04.753 --> 00:45:05.774]  Let's just put it to you this way.
[00:45:05.894 --> 00:45:07.055]  It's very chilling.
[00:45:08.115 --> 00:45:11.718]  This swab holds 60,000 years of history.
[00:45:12.458 --> 00:45:13.819]  They've got a Q-tip for swabbing.
[00:45:35.143 --> 00:45:40.885]  Computational Biologists, Emerging Technology Designers, and Project Professionals to help make it happen.
[00:45:41.265 --> 00:45:44.346]  More than 150,000 people have already donated samples.
[00:45:46.307 --> 00:45:48.288]  Interested in innovation for collaboration?
[00:45:48.608 --> 00:45:50.008]  Talk to the Innovator's Innovator.
[00:45:50.048 --> 00:45:54.050]  Call IBM to learn more or visit IBM.com forward slash special.
[00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:58.151]  Now I could tell you what this is all about, but I'm not going to tell you.
[00:45:58.849 --> 00:46:00.190]  You want to figure it out for yourself.
[00:46:00.631 --> 00:46:01.772]  Google eugenics.
[00:46:02.412 --> 00:46:04.174]  Google IBM Holocaust.
[00:46:04.354 --> 00:46:05.315]  IBM Nazis.
[00:46:05.415 --> 00:46:06.896]  Mr. Watson was a top Nazi.
[00:46:07.316 --> 00:46:19.467]  When you see the famous photos of concentration camp victims with the ID number on them, you'll find out that those were for tabulation in IBM machines, computers, mechanical computers.
[00:46:20.519 --> 00:46:24.222]  And you'll find out that IBM is behind Applied Digital Solutions, the implantable chip.
[00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:26.964]  They are the biggest and most powerful corporation in the world.
[00:46:26.984 --> 00:46:28.285]  They're very secretive about that.
[00:46:28.345 --> 00:46:30.407]  You think it's GM or Google.
[00:46:30.467 --> 00:46:30.947]  It's not.
[00:46:31.007 --> 00:46:31.587]  Or Walmart.
[00:46:32.428 --> 00:46:34.229]  They own thousands of front companies.
[00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:37.072]  And I have a lot of intel on this.
[00:46:37.712 --> 00:46:40.474]  And they are very serious people.
[00:46:40.915 --> 00:46:42.316]  I'm going to leave it to you there.
[00:46:42.556 --> 00:46:45.338]  The Third Reich didn't die, ladies and gentlemen, and they're in control.
[00:46:46.153 --> 00:46:47.896]  Okay, so I saw this with horror.
[00:46:47.916 --> 00:46:50.661]  I already knew about the project, but it reminded me of it.
[00:46:50.942 --> 00:46:53.105]  By the way, it was IBM that mapped the human genome.
[00:46:53.125 --> 00:46:53.586]  Remember that?
[00:46:53.606 --> 00:46:55.249]  Remember with the government?
[00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:56.531]  See, this is much larger.
[00:46:56.571 --> 00:46:58.374]  This is very, very serious.
[00:46:58.695 --> 00:46:59.837]  So I turned the page.
[00:47:01.682 --> 00:47:11.664]  And sure enough, they've got ads here for sleeping pills and serotonin reuptake inhibitor, drugs that'll totally damage your brain.
[00:47:12.064 --> 00:47:15.385]  And then next to that, they've got the lie, the push for a global carbon tax.
[00:47:16.025 --> 00:47:17.065]  There is global heating.
[00:47:17.285 --> 00:47:18.165]  It's not man-made.
[00:47:18.825 --> 00:47:20.106]  Thousands of scientific reports.
[00:47:20.806 --> 00:47:22.766]  Al Gore's out shilling before Congress.
[00:47:24.027 --> 00:47:31.068]  So right next to the sleeping pill and Prozac ads, you have the inconvenient truth ad for his propaganda film.
[00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:35.532]  And then you turn the page, and they've got more propaganda.
[00:47:36.033 --> 00:47:37.253]  And then I came along to this.
[00:47:37.313 --> 00:47:39.475]  I thought, well, maybe, you know, I've gotten to page 12.
[00:47:40.035 --> 00:47:41.056]  Maybe I could read this.
[00:47:41.136 --> 00:47:46.299]  I said, literally, I said, oh, Russian Christians in the Siberian steppes.
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.121]  I'll just read this.
[00:47:48.801 --> 00:47:51.143]  I can read this and not hear about propaganda.
[00:47:51.543 --> 00:47:53.144]  I'm actually trying to escape.
[00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:56.726]  I'm trying to read something that isn't laced with evil.
[00:47:58.507 --> 00:47:59.328]  So I start reading.
[00:48:00.797 --> 00:48:02.438]  And it says, Photo Journal, page 12.
[00:48:02.538 --> 00:48:04.740]  This is the December 2006 issue.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:06.481]  Aftermath of history.
[00:48:06.901 --> 00:48:10.624]  Some of the world's most interesting and poignant stories never show up on the front page.
[00:48:11.004 --> 00:48:12.805]  They get tucked into the corner of page 23.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:19.284]  And I'm reading that, sitting at the kitchen table, and I go, oh goody, that sounds like something I'd write.
[00:48:19.564 --> 00:48:20.905]  I like the stuff that's on page 23.
[00:48:21.146 --> 00:48:25.669]  That's really what I do on my show, is I cover what people aren't covering, and I keep reading.
[00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:35.658]  If they're all told, along the periphery of the old Soviet Union, I found places where the transition to the New World Order has particularly shaky.
[00:48:36.979 --> 00:48:39.561]  And it went on to talk about the world government, you know, New World Order.
[00:48:41.124 --> 00:48:43.266]  And if you don't know what that is, folks, you better find out.
[00:48:43.767 --> 00:48:46.249]  And so I thought, well, I'll just turn the page again.
[00:48:46.269 --> 00:48:48.391]  I deserve a little something here.
[00:48:48.932 --> 00:48:50.773]  I'll find something that isn't propaganda.
[00:48:51.114 --> 00:48:53.576]  And the whole thing, I sat there for an hour and a half.
[00:48:53.957 --> 00:48:54.777]  I read the whole thing.
[00:48:54.857 --> 00:48:56.259]  It's all propaganda.
[00:48:56.799 --> 00:48:57.680]  It's all laced.
[00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:58.681]  Every bit of it.
[00:48:58.761 --> 00:48:59.762]  Super high grade.
[00:49:02.184 --> 00:49:03.606]  National Geographic is owned by News Corp.
[00:49:04.702 --> 00:49:05.282]  I didn't know that.
[00:49:05.302 --> 00:49:05.803]  I'll have to look.
[00:49:05.843 --> 00:49:06.583]  Wow, that's interesting.
[00:49:07.143 --> 00:49:09.504]  I mean, I know they've done debunking pieces on myself and others.
[00:49:09.564 --> 00:49:19.109]  I know that they've been used for decades as a CIA front, because it's a great cover as missionaries, or anthropologists, or photographers, or media people for CIA fronts.
[00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:26.153]  I know they've got a history back to the 40s, or the OSS, that the CIA grew into.
[00:49:26.213 --> 00:49:30.895]  But I mean, folks, if you've got my eyes, which it isn't hard to get them,
[00:49:31.917 --> 00:49:33.798]  You start opening any major magazine.
[00:49:33.978 --> 00:49:35.639]  It is hell on earth, folks.
[00:49:35.759 --> 00:49:37.800]  I mean, no wonder America's going down the tubes.
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:38.940]  People read this stuff.
[00:49:40.341 --> 00:49:41.541]  It's not liberal propaganda.
[00:49:41.561 --> 00:49:42.782]  It's not conservative propaganda.
[00:49:42.822 --> 00:49:48.424]  It's elitist propaganda to neutralize you and to sell you on all these things that are happening.
[00:49:49.125 --> 00:49:50.085]  So there's that report.
[00:49:53.149 --> 00:49:55.069]  And then let me go ahead and cover this now before we break.
[00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.889]  It's a short story.
[00:49:55.929 --> 00:49:56.890]  It's the Daily Times.
[00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:00.110]  IMF to urge depreciation in dollar.
[00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:05.751]  Berlin, the International Monetary Fund, will say further depreciation by the U.S.
[00:50:05.771 --> 00:50:11.392]  dollar is needed to help correct global imbalances in its latest World Economic Outlook, W.E.O.
[00:50:11.432 --> 00:50:11.792]  report.
[00:50:12.232 --> 00:50:22.334]  Germany's Studentstuch Zettung said on Saturday, if you're listening in Germany, I didn't pronounce that right, I'm sorry, Studentstuch
[00:50:23.326 --> 00:50:33.313]  Zatung said on Saturday, quoting from a draft of the W.E.O., the paper said, the Washington-based fund, private bankers that take your money, tax money.
[00:50:34.148 --> 00:50:40.772]  Extraordinarily aggressive for a correction in exchange rates above all so as to reduce the massive U.S.
[00:50:40.792 --> 00:50:42.153]  current account deficit.
[00:50:42.533 --> 00:50:56.561]  The dollar, which slid to a two-year low against the euro last week, should continue to depreciate in the midterm while the yen and the Chinese yuan and currencies of oil-exporting countries in the Middle East should all appreciate that increase, the draft W.E.O.
[00:50:56.601 --> 00:50:57.241]  report said.
[00:51:00.805 --> 00:51:06.150]  I've been reading the Financial Times of London for about ten years since I learned how important it is, because they just tell you what they're going to do right in that.
[00:51:06.651 --> 00:51:08.112]  We're going to be totally third world.
[00:51:09.333 --> 00:51:11.855]  You are going to be controlled by how much debt you have.
[00:51:11.875 --> 00:51:13.657]  You're going to have the equivalent of debtor's prisons.
[00:51:15.299 --> 00:51:16.960]  And basically, America is gone.
[00:51:17.661 --> 00:51:22.926]  And they're going to totally devalue the dollar down to about 20% of what its value was about six years ago.
[00:51:24.219 --> 00:51:27.741]  And everything, if the colleges, you name it, is going to ship to police and prisons.
[00:51:28.021 --> 00:51:30.842]  You already see the ITC technical isn't for computers anymore.
[00:51:30.862 --> 00:51:31.762]  It's for law enforcement.
[00:51:32.543 --> 00:51:37.045]  And if we don't turn this around fast, literally folks, you can abandon ship.
[00:51:38.505 --> 00:51:40.386]  And I'll wait until the country goes under before I leave.
[00:51:40.406 --> 00:51:41.747]  I'm going to try to fight to the last minute.
[00:51:42.067 --> 00:51:43.368]  But yeah, you'll have to leave the country.
[00:51:43.548 --> 00:51:45.188]  There's not many other places you can go anyways.
[00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:45.989]  It's a world government.
[00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:47.749]  Alright, we'll be back with the second hour.
[00:51:47.809 --> 00:51:48.590]  Totally jam-packed.
[00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:48.950]  Stay with us.
[00:51:51.281 --> 00:51:52.321]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:51:52.421 --> 00:51:57.243]  Over the years, Genesis Communications Network has grown by leaps and bounds, reaching millions of listeners.
[00:51:57.363 --> 00:52:00.244]  The impact on political and social issues have been enormous.
[00:52:00.384 --> 00:52:04.386]  Businesses associated with the network have grown to become valuable enterprises.
[00:52:04.706 --> 00:52:10.728]  If you are accredited and have an entrepreneurial spirit, national radio may be the opportunity you're looking for.

[00:52:24.978 --> 00:52:26.899]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:52:27.619 --> 00:52:30.780]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:37.882]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:53:06.588 --> 00:53:09.731]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:09.791 --> 00:53:11.972]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:12.253 --> 00:53:14.935]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:15.315 --> 00:53:17.297]  Call Alex now, toll free.
[00:53:18.211 --> 00:53:31.601]  Alright, I've got to cover the fact that one of the biggest stories last Friday through this weekend on every major TV network
[00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:47.412]  Has been Charlie Sheen being involved in a big 9-11 film that I'm consulting on.
[00:53:48.152 --> 00:53:49.233]  Lou Chang's final cut.
[00:53:49.633 --> 00:53:52.814]  Rosie O'Donnell going public that she believes 9-11's an inside job.
[00:53:53.954 --> 00:53:54.875]  And so much more.
[00:53:54.895 --> 00:53:58.096]  There's been other stars now going public.
[00:53:58.476 --> 00:54:00.676]  A lot more about to go public, by the way, I can tell you.
[00:54:02.357 --> 00:54:08.279]  But the news is how Fox and others responded to this with really serious yellow journalism.
[00:54:10.436 --> 00:54:11.376]  And they're not conservative.
[00:54:11.416 --> 00:54:12.797]  I'm sick of them using that mantle.
[00:54:13.197 --> 00:54:21.800]  We talked to Webster Griffin Tarpley about this, about 9-11 truth squads out all over the country confronting these neocons that use the attacks to butcher the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:28.482]  Also what's happening with Iran, with the seizure of these 15 British commandos, and the developments there.
[00:54:29.582 --> 00:54:34.644]  But right now, let me just spend a minute, and your calls are coming up too, Mark and John and Lindsey and everybody.
[00:54:34.664 --> 00:54:35.344]  We're going to get to you.
[00:54:35.964 --> 00:54:36.404]  I promise.
[00:54:37.465 --> 00:54:38.185]  Those and many others.
[00:54:39.753 --> 00:54:41.354]  I want to get into Alberto Gonzales.
[00:54:41.374 --> 00:54:43.136]  Now, this broke, of course, three weeks ago.
[00:54:43.656 --> 00:54:54.305]  And day one, I noticed there in the fine print of the news stories that were out on it, that he called, that Republicans called, different U.S.
[00:54:54.365 --> 00:54:57.308]  attorneys and told them, what's going on with this political case?
[00:54:57.328 --> 00:54:58.649]  Put pressure on this person.
[00:54:59.009 --> 00:55:00.350]  We have an election coming up.
[00:55:00.651 --> 00:55:01.692]  Are you going to indict them?
[00:55:02.432 --> 00:55:04.674]  And yeah, the president has the right to fire these people.
[00:55:04.714 --> 00:55:06.456]  When Hillary fired them all, it was terrible.
[00:55:07.016 --> 00:55:07.637]  When Bush
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.621]  You know, he only fired seven or eight.
[00:55:11.242 --> 00:55:15.825]  But the point here is they lied to Congress about it, and they fired them.
[00:55:16.066 --> 00:55:21.890]  You can fire these people at your pleasure, but you can't fire them because they won't commit a crime for you.
[00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:23.291]  Then it becomes serious.
[00:55:23.952 --> 00:55:36.381]  And Gonzales, and I've got the actual dates here, it turns out that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales lied to reporters on a March 13th about the scandal over the fired prosecutors.
[00:55:37.054 --> 00:55:39.817]  And it turns out that weeks before that, he lied to Congress.
[00:55:40.197 --> 00:55:45.703]  At the time, Gonzalez said he was not involved in any discussions about what was going on with the firings.
[00:55:46.123 --> 00:55:46.744]  And it goes on.
[00:55:47.164 --> 00:55:57.014]  On Friday night, however, the Justice Department revealed Gonzalez's participation in a November 27th meeting where such plans were made in the Associated Press reports.
[00:55:57.054 --> 00:55:58.155]  And those documents are public.
[00:55:58.215 --> 00:55:58.636]  I've read them.
[00:55:59.236 --> 00:56:02.579]  When he made the decision, and he, of course, was over the meeting.
[00:56:02.699 --> 00:56:04.120]  I mean, he's the guy.
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:07.903]  They've got a hundred of these, and it's a big deal to fire him, and he made the decision.
[00:56:08.403 --> 00:56:09.925]  Under, of course, orders from the President.
[00:56:10.865 --> 00:56:20.933]  He was in on a very detailed discussion of a five-step plan for carrying out the firings of the prosecutors, according to the AP, and then making up bad reviews for them.
[00:56:22.575 --> 00:56:28.199]  And then it goes on to talk about in March 6, 2005, he lied to Congress another time when it came to, quote,
[00:56:29.059 --> 00:56:41.406]  The policy of the United States is not to transfer individuals to countries where we believe that they will likely be tortured, whether those individuals are being transferred from inside or outside the United States, he told Congress.
[00:56:41.887 --> 00:56:48.391]  He went on to say the executive branch was not aware of or had not authorized any transfer of detainees in violation of that policy.
[00:56:49.679 --> 00:57:05.903]  Then it turns out they were flying them all over the world to secret torture camps to get fake confessions like they've gotten with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed now, where they even admitted, Associated Press, Reuters, London Telegraph, that they even threatened to torture his seven and ten-year-old sons.
[00:57:06.423 --> 00:57:14.265]  Now, dovetailing that with the fifteen British naval commandos grabbed a couple days ago, one of them female,
[00:57:15.777 --> 00:57:16.738]  They have GPS.
[00:57:17.378 --> 00:57:20.039]  Iran is saying that they were in their territorial waters.
[00:57:20.059 --> 00:57:21.640]  This isn't the first time the British have done this.
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:24.441]  They've got those three fleets up there, plus a British fleet.
[00:57:24.882 --> 00:57:26.883]  Now the French aircraft carrier is going over there.
[00:57:26.903 --> 00:57:28.423]  They're the only nuclear aircraft carrier.
[00:57:28.964 --> 00:57:30.404]  In a clear provocation.
[00:57:31.045 --> 00:57:33.526]  And we said, Gulf of Tonkin, USS Maine.
[00:57:34.386 --> 00:57:39.789]  Our government and the British government loves to start wars by having naval forces get into skirmishes.
[00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:45.272]  Now remember, admittedly, all these Iranian troops and diplomats are getting kidnapped.
[00:57:46.528 --> 00:57:47.509]  That's being ignored.
[00:57:47.929 --> 00:57:49.610]  I'm not defending Iran either, folks.
[00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:52.791]  This is a... Ahmadinejad needs a provocation.
[00:57:53.131 --> 00:57:56.693]  His right-wing government stays in power as long as he's being threatened.
[00:57:56.733 --> 00:58:00.215]  Bush and the UN are actually helping him with their hardline stance.
[00:58:00.575 --> 00:58:03.116]  The Russians have suspended building the Bashar reactor.
[00:58:03.457 --> 00:58:09.099]  That thing was nine years away from being able to create nuclear weapons-grade fissile material.
[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:10.980]  Now it's been suspended.
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:14.282]  There's no reason for this war, no reason for these sanctions.
[00:58:15.203 --> 00:58:21.525]  Other than the fact that it was part of the neocon plan, day one, to take over Iraq, then go into Iran and Syria.
[00:58:22.245 --> 00:58:26.886]  This is about getting those oil supplies so the oil doesn't flow to jack up oil prices.
[00:58:26.926 --> 00:58:29.547]  Now joining us is Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[00:58:30.647 --> 00:58:34.088]  Webster Griffin Tarpley wrote the unauthorized biography of Bush Sr.
[00:58:34.188 --> 00:58:35.049]  over a decade ago.
[00:58:35.089 --> 00:58:42.971]  He wrote 9-11 Synthetic Terror, made in the USA, a best-selling book that I carry via Infowars.com, the secure, safe video and bookstore shopping cart.
[00:58:43.644 --> 00:58:45.246]  He spoke at my National Symposium.
[00:58:45.286 --> 00:58:47.788]  It was aired four times on C-SPAN last year.
[00:58:47.808 --> 00:58:50.011]  And he's a good friend of mine.
[00:58:50.251 --> 00:58:54.155]  And to give us analysis on all the things that are breaking down is Webster Tarpley.
[00:58:54.195 --> 00:58:55.156]  Webster, thanks for coming on.
[00:58:55.965 --> 00:58:56.966]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[00:58:57.006 --> 00:58:57.526]  How are you?
[00:58:57.806 --> 00:58:58.547]  Good.
[00:58:58.907 --> 00:59:08.292]  I'm going to want to keep you into a couple of segments, but I'm not going to keep you too long because I want to cover some other news, but just crystallize it, boil it down for us as basic as possible.
[00:59:09.132 --> 00:59:24.101]  Number one, the huge Charlie Sheen news re-breaking with Rosie O'Donnell and the loose change front, and of course myself involved, and then dovetail that into the truth squads, what's happening everywhere these neocons go, and then the big issue, the provocation for Target Iran.
[00:59:24.947 --> 00:59:31.511]  I would interpret the entire picture centering around the Iran attack, and then maybe get to the other ones.
[00:59:31.531 --> 00:59:31.951]  Sure.
[00:59:32.051 --> 00:59:33.232]  Tell where I ran now.
[00:59:33.452 --> 00:59:37.394]  We now have, I think, this with a greater precision than we've ever had it.
[00:59:37.975 --> 00:59:44.358]  Some days ago, there's a weekly newspaper in Moscow called Argumenti Medvedi, Issues of the Week.
[00:59:44.979 --> 00:59:49.861]  And here we have a story by a journalist called Andrei Ugalanov, who's very, very well known.
[00:59:51.022 --> 01:00:11.686]  The editor of a weekly called Argumenti Fakti, which is also a pretty famous Russian publication, he cites sources close to the Russian General Staff saying, the US is now on track to attack Iran in the first week of April, most likely date April 6th, Good Friday,
[01:00:12.689 --> 01:00:13.610]  4 o'clock in the morning.
[01:00:14.131 --> 01:00:17.795]  A bombing campaign of 12 hours initially, 4 a.m.
[01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:18.736]  to 4 p.m.
[01:00:19.296 --> 01:00:24.181]  starting in the early morning of Good Friday, April 6th, local time in Iran.
[01:00:24.241 --> 01:00:31.488]  Now Webster, I mean not from the same source but from others, we've heard, oh it's going to be March 21st, it's going to be, and we haven't seen that.
[01:00:31.529 --> 01:00:35.633]  Now obviously there aren't three carrier task force groups and a bunch of other fleets
[01:00:36.453 --> 01:00:46.015]  Bigger than the first armada that attacked Iraq in 1990, and of course in 2003 in March, now four plus years ago.
[01:00:46.035 --> 01:01:00.978]  I mean, they're there for something, and obviously they need a provocation, and now we have embassies preparing to pull their people out of Tehran, so certainly that adds some credibility, but I mean, I don't know if we can, even going off this source, say that we think it's going to happen in April.
[01:01:01.518 --> 01:01:03.478]  The mere fact we're reporting on it may stop it.
[01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:07.954]  This is, I think, it's something different than just some journalist saying it.
[01:01:07.974 --> 01:01:11.976]  In other words, this is a calculative leak by the Russian General Staff.
[01:01:12.056 --> 01:01:14.998]  It's also confirmed by General Ivan Sharpe, as I'll get to in a second.
[01:01:15.478 --> 01:01:18.020]  Anyway, the idea here is not so different from what we've heard.
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:23.703]  It's going to be 20 targets targeted for bombing, uranium enrichment facilities, research centers,
[01:01:24.784 --> 01:01:25.624]  We're good to go.
[01:01:43.812 --> 01:01:47.733]  Wipe out the most important military headquarters of the Iranian Armed Forces.
[01:01:47.793 --> 01:01:52.434]  Well, we know that Sy Hersh reported two years ago that special forces from the U.S.
[01:01:52.494 --> 01:01:55.555]  and Britain and Israel have been in Iran the whole time illegally.
[01:01:55.595 --> 01:01:56.275]  That's admitted.
[01:01:56.615 --> 01:02:02.896]  And we know that they are planning a massive bombing campaign to target their conventional air, sea, and land forces.
[01:02:03.416 --> 01:02:06.477]  Particularly, yes, going after their fleet there.
[01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:11.198]  And I think we can put these 15 Royal Marines... These are typically
[01:02:11.903 --> 01:02:18.867]  The British are running terrorists into Arabistan and into the sort of Persian Gulf oil province of Iran.
[01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:22.590]  The British are implicated up to their necks in running terrorists in there.
[01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:24.951]  And that's very likely what this grab has been.
[01:02:25.071 --> 01:02:26.992]  And of course, the media doesn't call them terrorists.
[01:02:27.012 --> 01:02:29.274]  They call them freedom fighters being inserted in.
[01:02:29.594 --> 01:02:34.217]  Iran's supposed to sit there and take the bombings, the shootings, the police being shot down the streets.
[01:02:34.897 --> 01:02:36.678]  It's part of freedom, Webster.
[01:02:36.959 --> 01:02:37.379]  Of course.
[01:02:37.899 --> 01:02:42.087]  We're going to be right back with Webster Griffin Tarpley, a real expert on these issues.
[01:02:42.107 --> 01:02:45.552]  And then we're going to continue into the latest 9-11 revelations.
[01:02:45.573 --> 01:02:47.576]  And then I promise, your phone calls.

[01:03:53.427 --> 01:03:55.450]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:56.151]  It's March 23rd, 2007.
[01:03:56.191 --> 01:04:00.215]  Gold is at $663.20, and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $686.66, $345.88 for half, $172.94 for quarter ounce coins at $686.66, $345.88, and $172.94.
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:15.524]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[01:04:15.584 --> 01:04:18.587]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[01:04:18.668 --> 01:04:27.778]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the long-term fiscal outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[01:04:28.078 --> 01:04:33.364]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[01:04:33.824 --> 01:04:36.125]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[01:04:36.185 --> 01:04:38.606]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[01:04:38.986 --> 01:04:42.288]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:04:42.328 --> 01:04:46.009]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[01:04:46.070 --> 01:04:46.350]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:46.550]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:04:55.871 --> 01:05:01.356]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:01.736 --> 01:05:09.343]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.057 --> 01:05:17.102]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.503 --> 01:05:28.931]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.251 --> 01:05:32.774]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.214 --> 01:05:35.156]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.476 --> 01:05:39.319]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:53.621 --> 01:05:55.402]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:58.544]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[01:05:59.044 --> 01:06:01.245]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[01:06:01.865 --> 01:06:10.150]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:11.190]  An example?
[01:06:11.731 --> 01:06:14.572]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[01:06:15.453 --> 01:06:18.214]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[01:06:18.594 --> 01:06:21.856]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[01:06:22.634 --> 01:06:27.817]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[01:06:28.437 --> 01:06:29.918]  Money is not the problem.
[01:06:30.158 --> 01:06:31.139]  Availability is.
[01:06:31.679 --> 01:06:33.520]  Be careful when food supplies get short.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:37.443]  With no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[01:06:38.063 --> 01:06:40.184]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633.
[01:06:40.244 --> 01:06:41.225]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:41.245 --> 01:06:41.285]  800-409-5633.
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:57.941]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:58.021 --> 01:06:59.942]  Home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[01:07:05.984 --> 01:07:07.364]  Raging for the truth.
[01:07:07.884 --> 01:07:09.365]  Exposing corruption.
[01:07:09.945 --> 01:07:13.166]  Dismantling a false left-right paradigm.
[01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:15.187]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.047 --> 01:07:18.668]  Well, I could talk to Webster tirelessly for ten hours.
[01:07:18.728 --> 01:07:21.209]  He's just a balance of knowledge and information.
[01:07:21.229 --> 01:07:21.969]  A good friend of mine.
[01:07:22.748 --> 01:07:23.809]  Accomplished researcher.
[01:07:24.049 --> 01:07:25.230]  We've got loaded phones here.
[01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:27.631]  Denise is for Webster Darby, so we'll go to her.
[01:07:28.051 --> 01:07:30.012]  But Webster's leaving us after this segment.
[01:07:30.053 --> 01:07:35.116]  I'm going to get to everybody else who's holding out for that and get into a bunch of other news concerning 9-11.
[01:07:35.956 --> 01:07:52.326]  But bottom line, the same crew that lied to us about weapons of mass destruction and tortures people into giving fake confessions, the same crew that staged 9-11 as a pretext for all of this, just as Hitler staged attacks on his own military to start World War II, Gliwitz and Reichstag and all the other examples,
[01:07:53.681 --> 01:07:59.206]  We know that they had the British come out and claim that mortars of Iranian-make were used to attack the U.S.
[01:07:59.226 --> 01:08:00.288]  Turned out they were British-made.
[01:08:00.588 --> 01:08:01.769]  But they know the public's dumbed down.
[01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:03.030]  But that's now been admitted to be fake.
[01:08:03.711 --> 01:08:07.335]  And they've claimed that there's been these Iranians coming across attacking.
[01:08:07.355 --> 01:08:08.576]  Turns out that's not the case.
[01:08:09.197 --> 01:08:13.862]  So the point is, Iran is being framed.
[01:08:13.922 --> 01:08:15.524]  Iraq's already been framed with WMDs.
[01:08:16.517 --> 01:08:20.903]  And the question is, why didn't the Iranians just let these guys come into their waters?
[01:08:21.343 --> 01:08:26.810]  And the answer is, well, we know they've been secreting special forces to carry out black ops.
[01:08:27.451 --> 01:08:30.855]  And we know that our government admits that there are troops carrying out black ops.
[01:08:31.415 --> 01:08:35.841]  Now, how dare Iran not let troops come in and carry out black ops?
[01:08:36.525 --> 01:08:39.288]  And, I mean again, the New Yorker magazine admits that's happening.
[01:08:39.328 --> 01:08:50.618]  How dare Iran not allow British SAS and others to stage terror attacks as they've been caught, BBC's reported, blowing up mosques and blaming it on others in Iraq, Webster.
[01:08:51.098 --> 01:09:03.830]  Alex, the thing that gives this more seriousness, more consistency, is not only that Argumenty New Delhi puts it out, then RIA Novosti News Agency, very interesting website, they repeat it
[01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:14.552]  And then my friend General Leonid Ivashov, Colonel General Leonid Ivashov says, I have no doubt there will be an operation or more precisely a violent attack against Iran.
[01:09:15.072 --> 01:09:20.313]  We have drawn the unmistakable conclusion that this operation will take place.
[01:09:20.453 --> 01:09:21.693]  It will be an air attack.
[01:09:22.193 --> 01:09:26.454]  Smaller tactical nuclear weapons are likely to be a part of it.
[01:09:26.954 --> 01:09:29.955]  And then he goes on a scenario for the for the breaking up of
[01:09:30.815 --> 01:09:31.776]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:09:51.089 --> 01:09:51.750]  We're good to go.
[01:10:14.071 --> 01:10:15.233]  But we'll be blamed on Iran.
[01:10:15.293 --> 01:10:15.693]  Exactly.
[01:10:15.714 --> 01:10:18.257]  That's the February 1st testimony of the Senate Foreign Minister.
[01:10:18.277 --> 01:10:18.958]  Now, let's be clear.
[01:10:18.998 --> 01:10:23.765]  The former National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, is saying our government can stage stuff.
[01:10:24.146 --> 01:10:24.326]  Yeah.
[01:10:24.726 --> 01:10:25.908]  Now, here he is in Le Mans.
[01:10:25.948 --> 01:10:27.330]  This is the 23rd, 24th.
[01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:29.213]  It's yesterday, practically.
[01:10:29.253 --> 01:10:30.094]  It's the French Newsweek.
[01:10:30.414 --> 01:10:30.755]  It's a daily.
[01:10:30.775 --> 01:10:32.276]  French newspaper, it's a daily.
[01:10:32.857 --> 01:10:35.039]  So he's talking in Le Monde.
[01:10:35.099 --> 01:10:37.342]  I'm saying it's the equivalent of a national publication.
[01:10:37.622 --> 01:10:38.843]  Sure, it's a big newspaper.
[01:10:39.224 --> 01:10:43.548]  So he's asked, do you believe that there's going to be a provocation?
[01:10:43.568 --> 01:10:45.951]  Because he's talking about the increased danger of war with Iran.
[01:10:46.471 --> 01:10:51.977]  He says, I've seen people in this administration who would really like something like that, a provocation.
[01:10:52.178 --> 01:11:00.807]  And then he says the following, we also know that there was a discussion on a possible provocation which could have given a pretext
[01:11:01.388 --> 01:11:03.369]  To start the war against Iraq.
[01:11:03.429 --> 01:11:09.331]  So now he's talking about the White House memo where Blair and Bush are talking about staging something.
[01:11:09.671 --> 01:11:10.151]  Maybe.
[01:11:10.551 --> 01:11:12.612]  But maybe he's talking about something more.
[01:11:12.672 --> 01:11:14.753]  And he says this is before the beginning of the conflict.
[01:11:14.793 --> 01:11:17.214]  Now, in the larger sense, that of course is 9-11.
[01:11:17.274 --> 01:11:18.754]  Now let's be clear.
[01:11:18.794 --> 01:11:20.955]  Brzezinski's never left the Anglo-American.
[01:11:21.395 --> 01:11:25.440]  I mean, he's one of their top think tank experts.
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:32.367]  He wrote up the grand chess board strategy, pretty much adopting or mirroring the PNAC plan.
[01:11:32.607 --> 01:11:34.770]  And he started the war in Afghanistan.
[01:11:34.810 --> 01:11:39.355]  Now, today in the Washington Post, Sam Brzezinski has a big op-ed
[01:11:40.015 --> 01:11:41.095]  We're good to go.
[01:11:59.021 --> 01:12:01.283]  I think this is absolutely serious.
[01:12:01.303 --> 01:12:02.224]  So what does this show?
[01:12:02.464 --> 01:12:03.946]  Who does he represent in the elite?
[01:12:03.966 --> 01:12:07.329]  We know he is a David Rockefeller frontman.
[01:12:07.649 --> 01:12:11.853]  Why is he suddenly breaking ranks and constantly ringing alarm bells?
[01:12:11.973 --> 01:12:15.936]  Well, you've got the split in the ruling class, which has now been evident for several months.
[01:12:15.996 --> 01:12:21.461]  On the one side, George Shultz, Bush Cheney, Rupert Murdoch, Tony Blair.
[01:12:22.122 --> 01:12:24.605]  Generally speaking, the right-wing talk show hosts.
[01:12:24.765 --> 01:12:34.375]  On the other side, James Baker, the Democratic Party, Gordon Brown of the Exchequer in Britain, Brzezinski, Cargore.
[01:12:34.975 --> 01:12:37.938]  So you've got essentially the bombers and the stranglers.
[01:12:38.279 --> 01:12:42.002]  There's one group that says, US, Britain, Israel at war with the world forever.
[01:12:42.383 --> 01:12:45.166]  The other one says, no, we're too weak, we've got to use things like
[01:12:45.786 --> 01:12:48.848]  Malthusianism, global warming, banking, and the rest of it.
[01:12:48.868 --> 01:12:49.809]  World taxes, yeah.
[01:12:49.889 --> 01:12:52.651]  But I think right now the big question is how do you stop this?
[01:12:53.031 --> 01:12:58.915]  Ivashov calls, he says Russia should call an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to confront the UN.
[01:12:58.935 --> 01:13:03.859]  Yeah, but the UN just went ahead and voted for more sanctions on Iran.
[01:13:03.899 --> 01:13:09.643]  Yes, but sanctions do not, as the Russians are always saying, sanctions are the alternative to war.
[01:13:09.723 --> 01:13:10.664]  They are not war.
[01:13:11.104 --> 01:13:13.486]  The Russians say sanctions are not a form of war.
[01:13:13.506 --> 01:13:15.207]  Well, they are a form of the most ancient
[01:13:15.727 --> 01:13:20.129]  Yeah, but the Russians have a very, very different position.
[01:13:20.189 --> 01:13:24.431]  The Russians, Putin and Lavrov, are constantly warning, don't attack Iran.
[01:13:24.892 --> 01:13:27.393]  You've got meetings in... So what do you think is going to happen?
[01:13:28.093 --> 01:13:30.954]  I think that what's got to happen is people have got to mobilize.
[01:13:31.034 --> 01:13:32.135]  This is now the time.
[01:13:32.195 --> 01:13:33.916]  Get active or get radioactive.
[01:13:34.356 --> 01:13:36.397]  Form yourself some 9-11 truth squads.
[01:13:36.837 --> 01:13:43.480]  Go out and confront candidates on the... Now that's been happening everywhere to anybody of any level that goes anywhere.
[01:13:43.801 --> 01:13:44.441]  Shifting gears.
[01:13:45.161 --> 01:13:46.521]  Uh, Rosie O'Donnell goes public.
[01:13:46.542 --> 01:13:52.643]  There was a big high-powered Hollywood meeting Thursday with a lot of top stars talking about how they could go public that I'm privy to.
[01:13:53.043 --> 01:14:00.926]  Now it's broken thanks to a leaker, which I don't appreciate, that there's a big national release of loose change plan in the next six months that I was consulting on.
[01:14:01.206 --> 01:14:05.247]  But that did explode and it seems to have backfired on the people that leaked it.
[01:14:05.931 --> 01:14:09.533]  Well, I really haven't had time for this because I've been focusing on World War III.
[01:14:09.873 --> 01:14:14.276]  However, this is obviously one of the things that could contribute to generating some counter-motion.
[01:14:14.556 --> 01:14:16.737]  The problem is the counter-motion has got to be now.
[01:14:17.177 --> 01:14:23.781]  I urge everybody, ask yourself, what can you do this week and next week to ward off World War III on Good Friday?
[01:14:24.141 --> 01:14:33.426]  And get active, or get radioactive, 9-11 truce squads are away, take back the airwaves are away, confront your elected officials, confront presidential candidates,
[01:14:34.186 --> 01:14:38.467]  Go into an overdrive action mode and do something to stop this.
[01:14:38.527 --> 01:14:42.428]  If you go to this RIA Novosti news site, it's a whole different world.
[01:14:42.768 --> 01:14:46.649]  Take a look at the Topol-M missile that the Russians have been testing.
[01:14:46.909 --> 01:14:49.830]  They have some huge pictures of this mobile missile.
[01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:52.670]  There will not be a successful first strike against Russia.
[01:14:52.690 --> 01:14:55.711]  You can see that right away just by looking at one of those babies.
[01:14:55.771 --> 01:15:00.132]  So, the notion of the Third World War is futile and suicidal.
[01:15:00.472 --> 01:15:03.293]  It's time to drive the neocons out of public life
[01:15:04.712 --> 01:15:07.935]  Well, I agree.
[01:15:08.315 --> 01:15:20.267]  It's clear that there's amazing heat on the perpetrators of 9-11 and these wars to shut it down, but it looks like they've Katy-barred the door, that they're just going to go ahead and go with an upping of the Ponzi scheme, Webster.
[01:15:24.016 --> 01:15:26.077]  Shut it all down and stop the war that way.
[01:15:26.117 --> 01:15:29.518]  Webster's the author of 9-11 Synthetic Terror Made in the USA.

[01:17:56.147 --> 01:17:58.988]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:17:59.348 --> 01:18:02.109]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?

[01:18:52.001 --> 01:18:52.882]  It's no secret.
[01:18:53.142 --> 01:18:58.626]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[01:18:58.786 --> 01:19:03.569]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[01:19:03.909 --> 01:19:06.211]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[01:19:06.411 --> 01:19:09.013]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called No-BO.
[01:19:09.253 --> 01:19:17.398]  No-BO eliminates the bacterial growth which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration, which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.

[01:19:57.963 --> 01:20:05.187]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:20:05.428 --> 01:20:08.449]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:11.631]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:15.073 --> 01:20:16.054]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:21.029]  We had actually broken this report before it was ever in mainstream news.
[01:20:21.109 --> 01:20:23.972]  In fact, we're going to do another report on it later this week.
[01:20:25.033 --> 01:20:31.338]  I saw different victims and their family members, protest groups, a few months ago.
[01:20:31.358 --> 01:20:35.041]  I guess now it's about eight, nine months ago when I first learned of this.
[01:20:35.982 --> 01:20:40.446]  Protesting the fact that the body parts
[01:20:41.417 --> 01:20:57.638]  The wreckage had been taken to a landfill, but not just a landfill, an aggregate landfill, and we saw photos online, and by broken, we just picked up on, you know, families, groups that had posted this, I interviewed some of them, and it showed human bones and body parts.
[01:20:58.451 --> 01:21:12.782]  Out at these aggregate facilities where they make asphalt and concrete, they just took the... plus it's toxic waste, all the mercury from the switches in all of the computers and the thermostats in those buildings on 9-11.
[01:21:13.623 --> 01:21:24.732]  And we knew that they hauled the steel away with GPS on each piece of steel, with armed guards, no one could take photos, because it had clear blast points on it, of course, from 9-11.
[01:21:25.152 --> 01:21:27.314]  But I didn't know they were using it for the highways.
[01:21:28.482 --> 01:21:30.202]  This is Reuters.
[01:21:30.222 --> 01:21:35.184]  9-11 remains possibly used on roads, court papers show.
[01:21:36.604 --> 01:21:45.486]  And it's come out in court papers, and this is from affidavits filed in 2005, that, well, it just goes through it.
[01:21:45.546 --> 01:21:57.289]  Eric Beck, a construction worker employed at the Fresh Kills Landfill, that's what it's called, in the borough of Staten Island where the rubble was taken after the Twin Towers fell, said his affidavit, the process of sifting through the debris was rushed.
[01:21:57.858 --> 01:21:58.552]  And then they, uh...
[01:21:59.153 --> 01:22:09.295]  And remember, firefighters didn't want that to happen, so the cops came and beat them all up and took them to jail, and Giuliani said they were sinners, that was a quote, and bad, and yeah, those firefighters are scum now, too.
[01:22:09.475 --> 01:22:10.875]  They're with Al-Qaeda!
[01:22:11.516 --> 01:22:15.957]  Anybody who doesn't submit to us filling potholes with your bones is with Al-Qaeda.
[01:22:16.237 --> 01:22:18.037]  Let us steal trillions from the Pentagon.
[01:22:18.417 --> 01:22:19.517]  Let us get rid of the borders.
[01:22:19.837 --> 01:22:22.918]  Let us butcher the Bill of Rights and bring you into a North American Union.
[01:22:23.198 --> 01:22:25.839]  You just sit down and shut up and you don't ask questions.
[01:22:26.079 --> 01:22:27.639]  You're a government's boss.
[01:22:28.422 --> 01:22:35.126]  And you don't ask questions about the Texas Youth Commission and a bunch of the other big youth commissions running giant slave brothels and selling the kids out.
[01:22:35.506 --> 01:22:37.027]  You just keep your mouth shut.
[01:22:37.067 --> 01:22:38.148]  We're the government.
[01:22:38.528 --> 01:22:39.688]  We're God.
[01:22:40.029 --> 01:22:41.830]  You just learn to worship us.
[01:22:42.330 --> 01:22:45.031]  And that's basically what it comes down to, and I frankly am sick of it.
[01:22:45.412 --> 01:22:46.732]  And I'm sick of all their crimes.
[01:22:47.193 --> 01:22:50.234]  Okay, let's go to a caller who disagrees first, and all the patient callers.
[01:22:51.695 --> 01:22:52.956]  Folks who disagree go to the head of the line.
[01:22:52.996 --> 01:22:56.598]  Number one, it says, David Austin, why would you side with Rosie O'Donnell?
[01:22:58.186 --> 01:23:00.048]  I'm not siding with Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:23:00.268 --> 01:23:06.393]  I protested and boycotted her back in the late 90's for going to get Kmart not to sell guns.
[01:23:07.834 --> 01:23:08.215]  Okay?
[01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:10.897]  And I said last week on the air, she's silly and she's ignorant.
[01:23:11.537 --> 01:23:13.459]  But she's got guts and guts is enough.
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:22.747]  She's gone public on her website and I've gotten to know people that are guests on the show and co-hosts on the show and I'm about to be in contact with her.
[01:23:24.364 --> 01:23:26.285]  I've learned that she now knows about the New World Order.
[01:23:26.605 --> 01:23:28.246]  She's had a lot of her politics shifted.
[01:23:28.626 --> 01:23:29.487]  She's waking up.
[01:23:29.547 --> 01:23:30.667]  She's always been a loose cannon.
[01:23:31.108 --> 01:23:36.350]  And she did post a bunch of stuff about it being an inside job and gave evidence to Building 7 being blown up and the rest of it.
[01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:37.571]  And so that's why.
[01:23:37.611 --> 01:23:38.812]  But let's just go ahead and go to...
[01:23:40.166 --> 01:23:42.147]  Dave in Austin, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:23:42.207 --> 01:23:49.170]  Well, you thought it was going to be about Thunder, but the thing is, though, she is what she's talking about because her world would be socialist.
[01:23:49.511 --> 01:23:51.371]  She's a socialist, along with Charlie Sheen.
[01:23:51.692 --> 01:23:54.213]  These people have sided so far to the left, they're communists.
[01:23:54.673 --> 01:23:59.195]  Now, I know Charlie Sheen, sir, he is extremely what you'd call conservative.
[01:23:59.215 --> 01:24:00.896]  He's always been big into guns.
[01:24:01.216 --> 01:24:06.979]  I don't know what you're getting, but I tell you what, I've seen the guy laying down in the streets in front of the
[01:24:09.702 --> 01:24:12.185]  I'm gonna stop you right there.
[01:24:13.287 --> 01:24:13.687]  No, no, no.
[01:24:13.727 --> 01:24:14.228]  Hold on, sir.
[01:24:14.248 --> 01:24:14.969]  I'm gonna let you talk.
[01:24:15.009 --> 01:24:16.290]  Just let me say something, okay?
[01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.611]  Sure.
[01:24:17.171 --> 01:24:25.622]  Number one, the Fox News and the New York Post, when they were talking about a website that Rosie linked to, they got the name wrong.
[01:24:26.512 --> 01:24:33.335]  Uh, when Fox News kept saying Martin Sheen shouldn't have gone public on 9-11, I'm not going to watch Martin Sheen's show.
[01:24:33.855 --> 01:24:35.876]  You're talking about Martin Sheen, sir.
[01:24:36.156 --> 01:24:38.937]  We're talking about Charlie Sheen, his son.
[01:24:39.338 --> 01:24:41.158]  Okay, I'm sorry if that's my mistake.
[01:24:41.178 --> 01:24:45.260]  No, no, no, I just want to... I'm talking about Daddy, the one that plays Mr. President and thinks he's a president.
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:45.920]  Daddy, Daddy is...
[01:24:47.842 --> 01:24:51.704]  Uh, what you could call very leftist, but, but let me just say this.
[01:24:52.224 --> 01:24:57.507]  Actually, I'm not going to talk about who I know or what I know, but let, I mean, they're into whole milk.
[01:24:57.607 --> 01:24:58.788]  They don't take vaccines.
[01:24:59.368 --> 01:25:02.389]  Uh, they're actually, you know, pro second amendment from what I know.
[01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:04.370]  Now on some social issues, very liberal.
[01:25:04.410 --> 01:25:04.610]  Yes.
[01:25:05.051 --> 01:25:07.912]  But, but, but Charlie, Charlie's his own man.
[01:25:08.432 --> 01:25:10.573]  And, uh, that's just the facts and I know him very well.
[01:25:10.673 --> 01:25:10.833]  Okay.
[01:25:10.854 --> 01:25:11.654]  Well, I got, I'm sorry.
[01:25:11.694 --> 01:25:12.434]  That was my mistake.
[01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:14.355]  I thought you were talking about daddy, but that's fine.
[01:25:14.415 --> 01:25:15.756]  It's a bit, my main thing is just,
[01:25:16.289 --> 01:25:26.353]  With Rosie O'Donnell, it's just that I have a real problem with anybody, because Alex, when I hear things you say, you give meaning to people like Cindy Sheehan, and that's the stuff that bothers them.
[01:25:26.393 --> 01:25:27.774]  These people are so far left.
[01:25:28.214 --> 01:25:33.356]  The woman is a psych job, and I'm talking about Sheehan and what I've seen with Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:25:33.376 --> 01:25:36.637]  Well yeah, her son's dead, she's got a divorce, her life's ruined.
[01:25:37.198 --> 01:25:38.778]  Why is she a psych job?
[01:25:41.633 --> 01:25:41.994]  I'm sorry?
[01:25:42.214 --> 01:25:43.196]  Why is she a psych job?
[01:25:43.797 --> 01:25:46.322]  Just the stuff that she sides with, the things she likes.
[01:25:46.622 --> 01:25:54.997]  Her son that died, she abandoned him seven years ago, and his grave today still doesn't have a marker on it, and she's got another son she's abandoned.
[01:25:55.695 --> 01:26:05.722]  And she's up there protesting against the war, which, believe me, I'm not no big war fanatic, but she's up there protesting against the war when she is being fed by the left wing radicals.
[01:26:05.742 --> 01:26:07.943]  Well, sir, listen, I hear you and you've had your say.
[01:26:08.323 --> 01:26:09.184]  I agree with some of it.
[01:26:09.704 --> 01:26:11.645]  I'm no fan of the left, okay?
[01:26:12.606 --> 01:26:13.687]  But I'm no fan of the right.
[01:26:13.787 --> 01:26:20.191]  I mean, the right says some of the right things, but Bush signed the SPP, North American Union, we're in it.
[01:26:20.571 --> 01:26:24.834]  He's trying to pass the Democratic introduced blanket amnesty bill.
[01:26:26.641 --> 01:26:31.284]  This war, we have the Pentagon documents now where they meant to keep us there at least 30 years.
[01:26:31.604 --> 01:26:33.745]  They lied to the troops and said you're going to be home by Christmas.
[01:26:34.106 --> 01:26:35.487]  That was nine months.
[01:26:36.087 --> 01:26:37.688]  They knew that was a lie all along.
[01:26:39.009 --> 01:26:41.150]  They plan to plant WMDs.
[01:26:41.351 --> 01:26:42.671]  We have the White House memo.
[01:26:43.572 --> 01:26:43.912]  Okay?
[01:26:44.553 --> 01:26:46.454]  I mean, George Bush is not a conservative.
[01:26:47.355 --> 01:26:51.137]  And frankly, the people following him aren't.
[01:26:52.858 --> 01:26:53.899]  I don't know what to say anymore.
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:27:05.852]  I mean, Bill Clinton didn't have top gay porn stars and gay madams and male hookers constantly in the White House in the middle of the night.
[01:27:06.493 --> 01:27:13.882]  You know, I talk about how George Bush is in the Skull & Bones Bohemian Grove, and national Christian talk shows say I'm a demon possessed of the devil.
[01:27:16.258 --> 01:27:24.661]  I don't know what devil you're talking about, but I'm not the one giving pledges to Lucifer like George Bush and his cousin John Kerry did.
[01:27:24.721 --> 01:27:26.001]  I'm telling you, it's staged.
[01:27:26.321 --> 01:27:29.262]  We're dealing with trillions of dollars these people make and suck off us.
[01:27:29.642 --> 01:27:31.563]  You think they're going to let you have a real choice?
[01:27:32.779 --> 01:27:35.361]  This whole left-right thing is fake.
[01:27:35.761 --> 01:27:38.983]  Rosie O'Donnell, I know people that go on vacation with her.
[01:27:39.363 --> 01:27:40.644]  I know people that work with her.
[01:27:41.144 --> 01:27:44.026]  Okay, I've got her number and info and I'm about to speak with her.
[01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:46.207]  And they told me, no, she's changed.
[01:27:46.247 --> 01:27:47.708]  She's still liberal on a bunch of issues.
[01:27:48.208 --> 01:27:50.270]  You know, cats don't change their spots overnight.
[01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:51.670]  But she's coming over.
[01:27:52.271 --> 01:27:54.032]  I know a lot of Hollywood people, folks.
[01:27:54.432 --> 01:27:55.753]  I know some of the biggest names.
[01:27:55.793 --> 01:28:01.396]  In fact, of the top five Hollywood stars, I know, or have gotten to know, three of them.
[01:28:02.441 --> 01:28:03.202]  I mean, the top.
[01:28:03.822 --> 01:28:05.503]  They are into the Second Amendment.
[01:28:05.583 --> 01:28:07.344]  They want to defend our nation.
[01:28:08.325 --> 01:28:10.426]  They know about 9-11, but they won't go public.
[01:28:11.366 --> 01:28:11.587]  Okay?
[01:28:11.607 --> 01:28:14.528]  It's just amazing.
[01:28:14.548 --> 01:28:17.350]  Alright, let's jam in some more calls here, because I've got a couple of clips I want to play.
[01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:17.830]  Well, you know what?
[01:28:17.850 --> 01:28:18.611]  I promised to do this.
[01:28:19.625 --> 01:28:21.626]  Here's an example of people getting things wrong.
[01:28:21.766 --> 01:28:26.630]  Alan Combs says that I'm behind the big new Loose Change Final Edition.
[01:28:26.670 --> 01:28:27.610]  No, I'm a consultant.
[01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:29.572]  Some of my footage is being used in it.
[01:28:29.912 --> 01:28:31.293]  I'm friends with the Loose Change guys.
[01:28:31.933 --> 01:28:44.021]  I was going to make a film with Charlie, but we really decided it would be easier to take this and redo it, and I just handed the ball off, folks, because, you know, I don't even care about the glory of having... I mean, can you imagine putting a hardcore film like that in theaters?
[01:28:44.301 --> 01:28:45.182]  Never before been done.
[01:28:45.222 --> 01:28:47.283]  It makes Citizen Kane look like child's play.
[01:28:47.839 --> 01:28:50.100]  Well, let's play a couple minutes of Hannity & Cumbs Friday night.
[01:28:51.081 --> 01:28:51.901]  We've only got 30 seconds.
[01:28:51.921 --> 01:28:56.864]  We'll come back, play about a minute of that, just to show you all the mistakes that are being made by the media.
[01:28:57.124 --> 01:28:58.225]  It's not Martin Sheen.
[01:28:58.625 --> 01:29:00.126]  I'm not behind Mark Cuban.
[01:29:01.187 --> 01:29:02.547]  I'm not behind the whole thing.
[01:29:02.667 --> 01:29:04.108]  I'd like to toot my horn and say I was.
[01:29:04.849 --> 01:29:06.990]  They called Michael Rivero, Matt Rivero.
[01:29:07.190 --> 01:29:08.411]  They just can't get anything right.
[01:29:09.091 --> 01:29:09.431]  Okay?
[01:29:10.912 --> 01:29:11.072]  Ha!
[01:29:11.832 --> 01:29:14.354]  When we get back after this quick break, we'll hit that.
[01:29:15.518 --> 01:29:20.362]  I'll try to go listen during the break to get right to the part where Kramer, Jim Kramer, Mitzi engages in all this crime.
[01:29:21.924 --> 01:29:22.844]  This is the real world.
[01:29:24.466 --> 01:29:26.988]  They've been talking so long they don't even know when to shut up now.
[01:29:28.169 --> 01:29:29.150]  We got loaded phone lines.
[01:29:29.170 --> 01:29:30.891]  We're getting to John, Daniel, Lindsey, Mark.
[01:29:31.372 --> 01:29:32.253]  We'll get to everybody!
[01:29:32.733 --> 01:29:34.274]  Okay, coast to coast, border to border.
[01:29:34.294 --> 01:29:37.998]  It's the new syndicated show we've been doing about four or five months and I'm honored to be your host.
[01:29:38.018 --> 01:29:38.378]  Stay with us.
[01:29:41.288 --> 01:29:41.609]  You don't get me.
[01:29:41.629 --> 01:29:41.789]  But I do!
[01:29:53.299 --> 01:29:59.802]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[01:30:00.022 --> 01:30:04.064]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[01:30:04.284 --> 01:30:06.445]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[01:30:06.805 --> 01:30:13.828]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[01:30:14.148 --> 01:30:16.749]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[01:30:17.029 --> 01:30:20.491]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:28.698]  Nonex Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:30:29.079 --> 01:30:30.560]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:45.154]  You'll find Nonex Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[01:30:45.934 --> 01:30:51.378]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[01:30:56.422 --> 01:30:58.244]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[01:30:58.304 --> 01:31:00.525]  Sure, you've got a mortgage and credit cards.
[01:31:00.826 --> 01:31:03.968]  Your debt creation is probably the smartest thing you've ever done.
[01:31:04.408 --> 01:31:08.692]  How would it be to find $75,000, $150,000, $200,000 or more you never knew you had?
[01:31:09.412 --> 01:31:11.834]  Now the task force has strategies to make these
[01:31:14.372 --> 01:31:16.693]  Ben Franklin said, a penny saved is a penny earned.
[01:31:17.333 --> 01:31:25.795]  By doing nothing more than you're doing right now, because you've used your credit, the right strategies can make the debt part of your financial life the smartest thing you've ever done.
[01:31:26.316 --> 01:31:29.016]  Oh, by the way, your strategies cost you nothing out of pocket.
[01:31:29.697 --> 01:31:32.477]  Go ahead and check out the debt elimination scams if you'd like to.
[01:31:32.998 --> 01:31:37.459]  You wouldn't take money from a loan shark, so you may not want to give your money to a debt shark.
[01:31:38.197 --> 01:31:41.722]  For an understanding of what a financial genius you truly are, call 800-409-5633.

[01:32:42.877 --> 01:32:43.898]  By calling New Millennium
[01:32:47.419 --> 01:32:58.309]  Hi, I'm Joyce Riley and many of you know that for years I was a cardiovascular heart transplant nurse.
[01:32:58.649 --> 01:33:01.612]  Since that time I've educated myself on the importance of preventative care.
[01:33:02.012 --> 01:33:05.876]  It all begins with providing your heart and vascular system with building blocks for good health.
[01:33:06.316 --> 01:33:10.360]  Strauss Heart Drops is the original formula that was copied by others but never duplicated.
[01:33:10.971 --> 01:33:15.476]  Strauss Heart Drops were developed by a master herbalist, Jim Strauss, after he suffered a heart attack in 1979.
[01:33:16.538 --> 01:33:19.321]  His doctor said he would only survive if he had heart bypass surgery.
[01:33:19.341 --> 01:33:20.522]  Then Jim said no.
[01:33:21.003 --> 01:33:25.288]  He developed Strauss Heart Drops, the formula that has been copied by others, but never been surpassed.
[01:33:25.728 --> 01:33:28.231]  Get the original Strauss Heart Drops, 4-ounce bottle, for only $79.99.
[01:33:29.833 --> 01:33:32.136]  Call the Power Hour at 877-817-9829.
[01:33:32.156 --> 01:33:32.816]  877-817-9829.
[01:33:33.937 --> 01:33:39.723]  You've probably heard about the other products that have tried to copy the Strauss formula?
[01:33:39.984 --> 01:33:42.206]  Well, get the original Strauss Heart Drops by calling 877-817-9829.
[01:33:42.226 --> 01:33:42.486]  That's 877-817-9829.
[01:33:42.506 --> 01:33:45.269]  Now you can really do your heart right with Strauss Heart Drops.
[01:33:58.474 --> 01:34:02.095]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:34:02.915 --> 01:34:05.396]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:34:08.096 --> 01:34:09.056]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:09.096 --> 01:34:11.337]  All right, back live.
[01:34:11.357 --> 01:34:13.017]  But an example of the media getting it wrong.
[01:34:13.057 --> 01:34:14.337]  And I'm not bashing Alan Cohn.
[01:34:14.357 --> 01:34:15.778]  I've been on his radio show many times.
[01:34:17.738 --> 01:34:20.479]  But I'm a consultant on the film.
[01:34:21.119 --> 01:34:22.979]  And I guess I've been there from the start of it.
[01:34:23.659 --> 01:34:26.020]  But I'm not behind the film.
[01:34:27.067 --> 01:34:36.250]  Here's a clip from one of literally dozens of TV programs, clips, sections of programs about loose change final cut to go in theaters.
[01:34:36.970 --> 01:34:38.610]  Mark Cuban involved and all the rest of it.
[01:34:38.650 --> 01:34:38.930]  Here it is.
[01:34:40.091 --> 01:34:41.271]  Welcome to Wall Street Confidential.
[01:34:41.311 --> 01:34:43.192]  I'm Aaron Task, joined again by Jim Cramer.
[01:34:43.212 --> 01:34:43.672]  Jim, welcome.
[01:34:44.092 --> 01:34:53.155]  That's the Jim Cramer clip that I don't know if we'll have time to play, where he admits how to manipulate and control the market, like it's a rigged slot machine.
[01:34:53.375 --> 01:34:54.675]  Yeah, here's the Fox one.
[01:34:55.157 --> 01:34:59.860]  Take free speech, which we all agree we all have, and you meet that with other free speech.
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:00.961]  I'm not saying he can't say it.
[01:35:01.041 --> 01:35:13.028]  Nobody said he can't say it, but what you're saying is I shouldn't be able to react to his... I didn't say you shouldn't be able to, I said you choose to make it a personal attack on the individual rather than deal with what the individual is actually saying, which you could easily refuse.
[01:35:13.068 --> 01:35:14.129]  I think he's out of his mind!
[01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:24.180]  I know you're thinking that... Michael, can we believe... People who support that, also giving aid and comfort to the enemy, who want to... Stop with the aid and comfort to the enemy.
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:26.463]  Michael, can we believe everything the government tells us?
[01:35:28.185 --> 01:35:29.726]  What kind of a question is that?
[01:35:29.746 --> 01:35:30.207]  A good one.
[01:35:30.885 --> 01:35:35.527]  Alex, you know, it's a lousy question because what you're saying is, I think Martin Sheen's an idiot.
[01:35:35.907 --> 01:35:36.187]  Aha!
[01:35:36.307 --> 01:35:37.788]  But maybe we should question what's going on here.
[01:35:37.808 --> 01:35:40.869]  I'm trying to get beyond the idiot calling and actually have a conversation with you if that's possible.
[01:35:40.889 --> 01:35:41.269]  He is an idiot!
[01:35:41.429 --> 01:35:42.390]  Can we believe everybody?
[01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:44.191]  We've already established that you think he's an idiot.
[01:35:44.211 --> 01:35:45.291]  That's your level of debate.
[01:35:45.571 --> 01:35:47.352]  Do you think the government, at whatever level it was...
[01:35:47.652 --> 01:35:49.193]  Don't make the issue other than what it is.
[01:35:49.553 --> 01:35:56.235]  It is Charlie Sheen, Mark Cuban, supporting Charlie Sheen to put this out so the left can have an orgasm.
[01:35:56.355 --> 01:35:57.595]  By the way, one other point.
[01:35:57.635 --> 01:35:58.735]  Let me go to Leslie Marshall.
[01:35:58.896 --> 01:36:02.597]  This is not about left or right.
[01:36:02.637 --> 01:36:14.480]  The only person having an orgasm here, Michael, are the right attacking the Sheens, Charlie and his father, attacking any conspiracy theory, actually attacking any one individual on a personal level, I agree with that.
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:15.861]  This is also not a left-right issue.
[01:36:17.021 --> 01:36:19.343]  Alex Jones is behind this movie.
[01:36:19.363 --> 01:36:20.764]  He's a right-winger, by the way.
[01:36:20.784 --> 01:36:21.785]  It's not left or right.
[01:36:21.905 --> 01:36:22.746]  Okay, that's enough.
[01:36:22.766 --> 01:36:24.788]  But it is a good point about how it's not left or right.
[01:36:24.808 --> 01:36:26.249]  They love to make it left or right.
[01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:32.714]  Frankly, I'd say about half the people on the 9-11 prison that you'd call conservatives or libertarians or constitutionalists of that whole genre.
[01:36:32.734 --> 01:36:33.475]  Probably more than half.
[01:36:34.113 --> 01:36:34.454]  Okay?
[01:36:34.674 --> 01:36:35.756]  And we're the hardcore ones.
[01:36:35.836 --> 01:36:37.479]  I'm the father of 9-11 Truth, okay?
[01:36:37.799 --> 01:36:38.741]  I'm a real conservative.
[01:36:39.021 --> 01:36:41.045]  George Bush and Alberto Gonzales aren't.
[01:36:41.505 --> 01:36:41.726]  Okay.
[01:36:42.066 --> 01:36:43.509]  Now let's go look at the Jim Cramer thing.
[01:36:43.529 --> 01:36:44.811]  This is two and a half minutes long.
[01:36:45.011 --> 01:36:47.255]  Well, it's twelve minutes long, but I can't play the whole thing.
[01:36:47.992 --> 01:36:51.253]  First he says it's legal, then later he says it's illegal, and this has been looked at.
[01:36:51.273 --> 01:36:52.314]  Now we broke this Monday.
[01:36:52.354 --> 01:36:56.916]  We discovered this and broke this Monday or Tuesday, and then I saw it on Fox News of all places Friday.
[01:36:56.956 --> 01:37:01.357]  I'm in the office, got the big TV on with the audio off, and they're covering this.
[01:37:01.837 --> 01:37:11.801]  And of course he's got a show on CNBC, and he's admitting how they short the markets, and if they've already shorted them, how they go in and spend 5, 20 million sometimes to make sure a stock does go down.
[01:37:12.241 --> 01:37:15.703]  Okay, this is standard operating procedure, only one area.
[01:37:15.743 --> 01:37:16.063]  Here it is.
[01:37:16.903 --> 01:37:18.063]  Welcome to Wall Street Confidential.
[01:37:18.123 --> 01:37:19.984]  I'm Aaron Task, joined again by Jim Cramer.
[01:37:20.024 --> 01:37:20.484]  Jim, welcome.
[01:37:20.824 --> 01:37:21.265]  Good to see you.
[01:37:21.845 --> 01:37:22.425]  Thanks for being here.
[01:37:22.605 --> 01:37:25.846]  Our economic data today, but I want to talk about something else first.
[01:37:26.046 --> 01:37:28.707]  Again, today we have the misdirection from the future.
[01:37:28.727 --> 01:37:31.768]  The futures price went up market, and as of right now, it's actually down again.
[01:37:31.828 --> 01:37:34.329]  Is this just because it's the holiday period that we're seeing this?
[01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:42.312]  You know, a lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund, and I was positioned short, meaning I needed it down, I would
[01:37:43.658 --> 01:37:45.338]  We're good to go.
[01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:02.630]  I don't know.
[01:38:17.675 --> 01:38:18.836]  I'm not going to say it on TV.
[01:38:46.494 --> 01:38:50.756]  Well, on a related note, there's so many more hedge funds today than when you were managing your hedge fund.
[01:38:50.776 --> 01:38:50.956]  Right.
[01:38:50.996 --> 01:38:53.817]  Do you think that, does that exacerbate the moves, or does it make it tougher?
[01:38:53.837 --> 01:38:56.618]  Well, you know, the hedge funds are positioned long short, okay?
[01:38:56.658 --> 01:38:57.938]  Not just long with mutual funds.
[01:38:58.398 --> 01:39:01.159]  So it's really vital these next six days, because of your payday.
[01:39:01.639 --> 01:39:03.120]  You've really got to control the market.
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:04.340]  You can't let it lift.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:10.742]  When you get a research in motion, it's really important to use a lot of your firepower to knock that down, because it's the fulcrum of the market today.
[01:39:11.203 --> 01:39:13.183]  So let's say I were short.
[01:39:13.223 --> 01:39:15.044]  What I would do is I would hit a lot of guys with RIM.
[01:39:15.704 --> 01:39:16.805]  Now, you can't ferment.
[01:39:16.925 --> 01:39:20.468]  That's a violation of... You can't foment.
[01:39:20.548 --> 01:39:25.492]  You can't create yourself an impression that a stock's down.
[01:39:26.172 --> 01:39:29.715]  But you do it anyway, because the SEC doesn't understand it.
[01:39:30.075 --> 01:39:32.277]  That's the only sense that I would say is illegal.
[01:39:32.297 --> 01:39:36.080]  But a hedge fund that's not up a lot really has to do a lot now.
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:36.660]  Okay.
[01:39:37.201 --> 01:39:39.182]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[01:39:39.202 --> 01:39:44.046]  And it talks about how they set people up who are coming into the market, how they use you, how they screw you.
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:45.900]  But here's an example.
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:47.461]  The stock market's still at around $12,000.
[01:39:48.021 --> 01:39:51.422]  They've doubled the money supply the last six years, so the stock market's really at around $6,000.
[01:39:51.482 --> 01:39:55.623]  So these are 101 simple financial numbers.
[01:39:56.224 --> 01:40:00.925]  But you watch CNN, you watch CNBC, you watch Fox, Cavuto, World, all this.
[01:40:01.685 --> 01:40:07.727]  They've got one brand of financial news for you, and then if you really want to know what's going on, you can go research it and find it out somewhere else.
[01:40:08.927 --> 01:40:10.568]  And it's set.
[01:40:11.827 --> 01:40:15.830]  And you've got all these good old boys around here locally, where I live in Austin, you think they know everything about it.
[01:40:16.090 --> 01:40:17.691]  And I always watch them get their shirt taken.
[01:40:17.711 --> 01:40:19.833]  You know, they may make five, ten million dollars.
[01:40:19.853 --> 01:40:20.573]  They're real arrogant.
[01:40:20.613 --> 01:40:24.196]  Next time you see them, they're living in a two-room apartment, you know, working at H-E-B.
[01:40:24.616 --> 01:40:26.097]  Working at the grocery store, which is fine.
[01:40:26.357 --> 01:40:29.099]  I mean, my point is, you think you know it all, you don't know it all.
[01:40:29.399 --> 01:40:31.581]  And there's a lot out there, America, you need to discover.
[01:40:32.001 --> 01:40:35.604]  So much of what you think you know about this country is a joke, okay?
[01:40:36.184 --> 01:40:38.485]  So just stop thinking that you're living in a free country.
[01:40:38.945 --> 01:40:44.166]  If we set about getting our free country back, because some of it's still left, we can save the country.
[01:40:44.406 --> 01:40:46.366]  We have to admit how bad it's gotten.
[01:40:46.626 --> 01:40:48.066]  Okay, let's take some final calls here.
[01:40:48.347 --> 01:40:49.707]  Lindsay in California.
[01:40:50.147 --> 01:40:51.907]  You want to talk about info about a protest.
[01:40:51.967 --> 01:40:52.767]  Okay, tell us about it.
[01:40:53.928 --> 01:40:54.488]  Yes, thank you.
[01:40:54.548 --> 01:40:56.428]  I'm a long-time listener, first-time caller.
[01:40:56.448 --> 01:40:57.648]  I appreciate you taking my call.
[01:40:57.668 --> 01:40:58.369]  Thanks for holding.
[01:40:58.389 --> 01:40:58.909]  You're on the air.
[01:40:58.929 --> 01:41:02.870]  Yeah, I have an idea for a protest on April 15th.
[01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.850]  Everybody listen up.
[01:41:05.549 --> 01:41:07.691]  This is a way to get our message out exponentially.
[01:41:07.711 --> 01:41:08.912]  This is what you need to do.
[01:41:09.072 --> 01:41:11.153]  First thing, collect all your junk mail.
[01:41:13.215 --> 01:41:15.777]  Second, write return to sender.
[01:41:16.738 --> 01:41:23.363]  I've heard of this idea and then write messages and use the junk mail as a way and like five or six people will see it and it's a shame.
[01:41:24.424 --> 01:41:32.750]  Yes, and if you keep the envelope sealed, then there's no problem as far as return to sender mail.
[01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:45.059]  So, you keep the envelope closed, you write, return to sender, stamp return to sender, your message, no matter what it is, investigate 9-11, end the war now, whatever message you want to get out.
[01:41:45.079 --> 01:41:46.320]  PrisonVina.com.
[01:41:47.421 --> 01:41:48.242]  Sure, absolutely.
[01:41:48.822 --> 01:41:54.907]  And then, on April 15th, you take all your junk mail and drop it off at the post office.
[01:41:56.669 --> 01:41:59.331]  That is a really good idea, and then shut down the post office.
[01:42:00.049 --> 01:42:00.670]  Absolutely.
[01:42:01.590 --> 01:42:05.593]  And it's a way for us to get our message out and it's something that can't be denied.
[01:42:05.753 --> 01:42:08.695]  So I urge all your listeners to please do this.
[01:42:08.755 --> 01:42:13.678]  Even if everybody on your station that's listening to this program now does it, it's still going to make a huge difference.
[01:42:13.738 --> 01:42:15.539]  I mean, how much junk mail do you actually get?
[01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:18.321]  My God, I get probably five pieces a day.
[01:42:19.002 --> 01:42:19.882]  Sometimes more.
[01:42:19.922 --> 01:42:20.703]  Good to hear from you.
[01:42:20.743 --> 01:42:21.483]  Great idea.
[01:42:21.903 --> 01:42:26.186]  Let's go ahead and talk to Daniel in Massachusetts.
[01:42:26.226 --> 01:42:26.887]  Go ahead, Daniel.
[01:42:27.887 --> 01:42:28.288]  Hello, Alex.
[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:33.301]  I just wanted to talk to you about the Iran issue.
[01:42:33.702 --> 01:42:33.962]  Yes.
[01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:40.144]  How is it that the American people are once again going along with this?
[01:42:40.384 --> 01:42:43.085]  I mean... The American people think their dollar is still full value.
[01:42:43.105 --> 01:42:44.766]  They think the WMDs were found.
[01:42:45.306 --> 01:42:51.489]  They really think that guys in the cave carried out 9-11 and had the NORAD stand down and did CIA insider trading.
[01:42:51.829 --> 01:42:54.650]  They really think that the Texas Youth Commission is helping the children.
[01:42:55.050 --> 01:42:57.391]  They really believe that mercury and vaccines is good for their brains.
[01:42:58.406 --> 01:43:09.910]  I mean, I hear all these polls saying that 60% of Americans are against the Iraq War now, but it doesn't really seem... It's more like 70% depending on the poll.
[01:43:10.290 --> 01:43:15.012]  Well, there are a lot of people who are awake, but they feel powerless.
[01:43:15.112 --> 01:43:18.873]  They don't feel like they have any power, and that's really the big problem.
[01:43:18.913 --> 01:43:20.473]  Let's try to jam in a couple more.
[01:43:21.454 --> 01:43:24.435]  Let's take a call here from Hollywood, California.
[01:43:24.475 --> 01:43:25.355]  John, quickly.
[01:43:26.116 --> 01:43:32.720]  Yeah, yeah Alex, I'm trying to spread your name out here in California, but you said something the other day that always makes me riffle when I hear it.
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:43.145]  I've listened to scholars from Harvard and what not, took an anthropology class back a ways, and you said that Jews learned masonry skills in ancient Egypt.
[01:43:43.445 --> 01:43:52.754]  Well, uh, the cryptologists have combed over the hieroglyphics here for many years, and they've come to the conclusion that Jews were not a part of ancient Egypt.
[01:43:52.834 --> 01:43:57.878]  Maybe a few were there, but, uh... Well, I mean, there were wandering people... Sure, sure, sure.
[01:43:57.978 --> 01:44:00.981]  It was a good picture, but it's mainly a myth.
[01:44:01.201 --> 01:44:02.182]  Sure, sure, we're out of time.
[01:44:02.222 --> 01:44:03.984]  You'll have to call me back next week, earlier.
[01:44:04.464 --> 01:44:05.545]  And we can talk about that.
[01:44:06.646 --> 01:44:15.494]  I just mentioned somehow on the show that this money brought up the Jews and I talked about how they'd been in Babylon and been in Egypt and been wandering all over.
[01:44:15.614 --> 01:44:18.877]  So, I don't know what to say about that.
[01:44:20.039 --> 01:44:21.940]  We can argue about it all day, but yeah.
[01:44:22.201 --> 01:44:24.623]  There's a lot of evidence they weren't used as slaves on the pyramid.
[01:44:25.919 --> 01:44:27.341]  And that slaves actually weren't used there.
[01:44:27.401 --> 01:44:28.503]  I think that's what you're talking about.
[01:44:28.903 --> 01:44:30.486]  But I don't claim to have all the answers.
[01:44:30.586 --> 01:44:32.068]  See you back next week, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:44:32.108 --> 01:44:33.451]  Central, with all the affiliates.
[01:44:33.491 --> 01:44:34.452]  Everybody, God bless you.
[01:44:34.472 --> 01:44:35.874]  Now get out there and fight the New World Order.
[01:44:36.155 --> 01:44:37.237]  Stand up for the Republic.
[01:44:37.497 --> 01:44:39.240]  Fight for America, not for phony wars.
[01:44:42.978 --> 01:44:47.220]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.

[01:45:16.715 --> 01:45:19.796]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:45:20.056 --> 01:45:27.638]  This low mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[01:45:27.698 --> 01:45:31.058]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
