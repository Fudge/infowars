[00:00:05.373 --> 00:00:06.013]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:07.754]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.434 --> 00:00:09.575]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:11.035]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:12.736]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.336 --> 00:00:16.998]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:21.620]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.853 --> 00:00:34.156]  The BBC really wrote the book on documentaries.
[00:00:34.256 --> 00:00:36.317]  It's the whole style of British television.
[00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:51.687]  And I don't watch a lot of television, but in the last couple days I have spent about an hour and a half trying to watch four hours of a four-part series that the BBC put together in the early 1990s.
[00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:55.187]  Absolutely amazing stuff.
[00:00:55.227 --> 00:01:08.513]  I already knew most of it, but to see it being admitted, open government mind control of the entire population, and they're just presenting it by the end of the series kind of like it's needed and good.
[00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.633]  Unbelievable!
[00:01:10.854 --> 00:01:18.437]  And we've got it posted up on PrisonPlanet.com so you can watch it later today or this evening or whenever you'd like.
[00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:27.390]  But we're going to play a few clips of it in this hour and then in the third hour coming up later today.
[00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.871]  I'm just going to air a few minutes of it.
[00:01:30.652 --> 00:01:46.461]  But just to learn that Stanford Research Institute and the Pentagon and just tens of thousands of psychiatrists and psychologists working overtime on how to manipulate and brainwash you and they just show it and interview all of them.
[00:01:47.327 --> 00:01:51.709]  Now you go out here and you tell somebody on the street that, they will laugh at you.
[00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.870]  They don't even know!
[00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:06.235]  And the incredible thing is, twenty, thirty years ago, at least middle class, educated people knew about this, and there was a movement to resist it, but it got totally co-opted.
[00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:11.578]  This is a very accurate, extremely truthful BBC piece.
[00:02:14.944 --> 00:02:19.726]  In fact, I'm tempted to just record the whole four hours and just air clips and clips of it.
[00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:22.486]  It's just such a treasure trove of information.
[00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:32.990]  And to have him just throwing down the gauntlet, just admitting it, just coming right out with it, is just off the charts.
[00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.331]  Alright, we do have D.B.
[00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:42.573]  Kidd, one of the most long-time, hardcore, staunch defenders of the Republic,
[00:02:43.556 --> 00:02:56.085]  And one of the great exposers, one of the great champions in the fight against the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve and its foot soldiers that are employed by the Internal Revenue Service.
[00:02:56.665 --> 00:03:03.850]  She'll be joining us to talk about a host of issues in NAU, North American Union, SPP, Security Prosperity Partnership and much more.
[00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.595]  Then, the senior editor of the Village Voice, Wayne Barrett, is scheduled to join us.
[00:03:11.916 --> 00:03:22.624]  He's done a lot of big exposÃ©s and overseen research pieces on that oily dirtbag, that crook, that murderer, Rudolph Giuliani.
[00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:33.713]  And so, we'll be going over Rudolph Giuliani for about 20-30 minutes in the third hour, because I want to have time to cover other news.
[00:03:36.247 --> 00:03:37.568]  Play some of those BBC clips.
[00:03:37.628 --> 00:03:41.872]  I also promised to air the last ten minutes of the Ron Paul Neocon speech.
[00:03:41.912 --> 00:03:47.077]  We've, the last two days, gotten around to airing about four-fifths of it.
[00:03:48.758 --> 00:03:51.300]  But we've aired exactly four-fifths of it.
[00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:56.365]  So we'll air that final fifth coming up in this hour as well.
[00:03:56.385 --> 00:03:58.687]  I don't know how much time we'll have for calls.
[00:03:58.707 --> 00:03:59.928]  We'll try to jam some in.
[00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:02.730]  That's the great frustration here.
[00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.511]  I love your calls.
[00:04:04.238 --> 00:04:07.881]  And I love to talk and try to flesh things out and get into issues.
[00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:08.882]  And I love the directions.
[00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:10.743]  Spin the wheel, where you take us.
[00:04:11.864 --> 00:04:13.906]  But this other news here has to be covered.
[00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:17.348]  This is a press release by the Pentagon Front Company.
[00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:20.511]  Verichip passed a significant milestone.
[00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:27.957]  Over 500 hospitals have now agreed to adopt Veramed patient identification system implantable microchip.
[00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:39.060]  Now, I remember this from memory, and if I can get my researchers to get on it, we'll put a report out on it, but four years ago, remember, they claimed 50 Florida hospitals had adopted it?
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.203]  And then the press called, the AP called them, and they said, no, we've not adopted anything, this is a complete lie.
[00:04:47.064 --> 00:04:55.207]  If I know Verichip, who are congenital liars, almost nothing they say is the truth, uh, this is a complete fraud.
[00:04:56.307 --> 00:04:57.388]  But, uh, we'll go over that.
[00:04:58.263 --> 00:04:59.664]  The latest stuff, stay with us.
[00:05:01.086 --> 00:05:09.493]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:17.480]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:25.242]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.643 --> 00:05:37.066]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.366 --> 00:05:40.848]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:43.248]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:47.450]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:53.194 --> 00:06:54.659]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:55.943]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:02.495 --> 00:07:06.617]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:07:06.857 --> 00:07:08.618]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:15.162]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:07:15.462 --> 00:07:21.565]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:07:21.826 --> 00:07:27.849]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:34.532]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.

[00:07:45.098 --> 00:07:47.459]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:50.060]  For more information call Biosolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.420]  That's
[00:07:53.422 --> 00:07:53.682]  1-866-885-6625.
[00:07:53.702 --> 00:07:54.583]  1-866-885-6625.
[00:07:54.843 --> 00:08:04.049]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:07.471]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:14.435]  Okay, I'm going to get into the latest huge developments, very important developments with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
[00:08:15.436 --> 00:08:18.778]  We're going to get into Verichip claiming 500 hospitals.
[00:08:18.818 --> 00:08:21.660]  They're going to start confining people with chips and their other products.
[00:08:25.075 --> 00:08:30.759]  But let me just read through some of the other type of headlines and news I have in case we never even get to it.
[00:08:34.041 --> 00:08:36.283]  I'm just trying to get through all the Khalid Sheikh Mohammed news.
[00:08:36.323 --> 00:08:37.844]  I've got about 20 reports on that.
[00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:50.113]  Texas House of Representatives defies governor on Monday and tells the governor that it's not mandatory that girls have to take the Gardasil live virus vaccine.
[00:08:52.051 --> 00:08:53.993]  Another report by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:08:54.113 --> 00:08:56.855]  Are we experiencing the last days of constitutional rule?
[00:08:58.676 --> 00:09:02.419]  Church school renames three little pigs to avoid offending Muslims.
[00:09:03.039 --> 00:09:04.100]  More mind control.
[00:09:05.061 --> 00:09:08.663]  Putin decrees creation of a media and internet regulator.
[00:09:10.004 --> 00:09:10.525]  Silencer.
[00:09:11.354 --> 00:09:15.355]  Castration ring, keys, figures, gain freedom.
[00:09:15.935 --> 00:09:18.815]  These are people who like to chop their arms and legs and genitals off.
[00:09:18.895 --> 00:09:20.476]  It's gaining steam around the country.
[00:09:20.516 --> 00:09:23.276]  And if you criticize them, you're a hate-filled bigot.
[00:09:25.697 --> 00:09:27.957]  This is what we're talking about, the culture that loves death.
[00:09:29.117 --> 00:09:34.058]  Ahmed Dinejad says, Iran will stick to atomic work.
[00:09:35.859 --> 00:09:38.319]  Danish scientist, global warming is a myth.
[00:09:39.463 --> 00:09:45.824]  Kucinich, impeachment may well be the only remedy which remains to stop a war of aggression against Iran.
[00:09:46.404 --> 00:09:48.745]  Homeland Security team to focus on U.S.
[00:09:48.785 --> 00:09:49.265]  terrorists.
[00:09:49.865 --> 00:09:52.646]  That's right, they're telling us, don't worry about Al-Qaeda now, it's the domestic groups.
[00:09:53.206 --> 00:09:55.166]  The fun can now start.
[00:09:55.186 --> 00:09:56.487]  They're getting us ready for the Democrats.
[00:09:56.507 --> 00:10:08.489]  When they come in, it'll be a reign of terror against citizens and suddenly most of the people running around with anti-Bush dickers will be stomping around calling for all of our arrest because we don't want to hand our guns in so the liberal utopia can begin.
[00:10:10.993 --> 00:10:12.274]  I'm not joking around, by the way.
[00:10:12.334 --> 00:10:13.054]  It's going to be bad.
[00:10:14.755 --> 00:10:17.896]  And suddenly I'll be a good right winger again.
[00:10:17.916 --> 00:10:19.237]  I'm not like Alex.
[00:10:19.297 --> 00:10:21.438]  And all the liberals will suddenly hate me again.
[00:10:21.478 --> 00:10:22.098]  It's fine.
[00:10:22.118 --> 00:10:24.139]  You enjoy tyranny and annihilation.
[00:10:24.299 --> 00:10:24.659]  Go ahead.
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.902]  Coming up later, Freud was used to control the masses.
[00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:32.043]  Incredible four-hour BBC report.
[00:10:32.943 --> 00:10:33.523]  Another story.
[00:10:33.603 --> 00:10:35.084]  Antibacterial ingredient.
[00:10:36.825 --> 00:10:37.305]  Tricin.
[00:10:39.224 --> 00:10:41.906]  Trickleson may be harmful to humans.
[00:10:41.946 --> 00:10:43.487]  This is the kind of stuff I've got.
[00:10:43.527 --> 00:10:45.789]  And the stack goes on for about five other inches.
[00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.671]  It's all so important.
[00:10:50.412 --> 00:10:50.712]  D.V.
[00:10:50.752 --> 00:10:52.373]  Kidd is joining us in the next hour.
[00:10:53.034 --> 00:10:59.118]  We do have the head editor from the Village Voice coming on to talk about Giuliani's real record for about 30 minutes in the third hour.
[00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:07.764]  Hold your calls right now, because I want to get into microchips, implantable tracking grid, RFID, and then I want to get into
[00:11:08.795 --> 00:11:09.475]  KSM.
[00:11:13.676 --> 00:11:15.436]  How do you properly cover this?
[00:11:17.517 --> 00:11:19.377]  Again, here's an example.
[00:11:19.497 --> 00:11:29.980]  Every report I just talked about has hundreds of different facets and nuances to it, how it hooks into the larger grid, and you just can't do it justice.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.660]  It's the same thing with this story.
[00:11:33.204 --> 00:11:40.948]  I've been studying applied digital solutions in the Verichip and the Digital Angel people, that's their main product line, since 2000.
[00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:50.754]  I've interviewed their CEO, I've interviewed their founding scientist, their chief of operations, their PR people, we've had them all on.
[00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:54.556]  We've had their different regional European directors, U.S.
[00:11:54.616 --> 00:12:00.419]  directors, nightclub owners from Baja Beach Club in Spain to
[00:12:01.659 --> 00:12:04.721]  Nightclub, Topless Bars in Miami, Florida.
[00:12:06.663 --> 00:12:08.744]  I have read hundreds of their press releases.
[00:12:09.525 --> 00:12:11.667]  I have studied them to the nth degree.
[00:12:11.887 --> 00:12:19.132]  I have spent hours reading their financial statements to the FEC and other groups.
[00:12:19.733 --> 00:12:22.635]  And let me just boil it down real simply here in the interest of time.
[00:12:23.268 --> 00:12:34.037]  They are a Pentagon slash IBM front company used simply as a front group to run at a loss year after year, no profits, huge losses.
[00:12:34.798 --> 00:12:38.261]  They're not held to any of the normal rules of any other major stock company.
[00:12:39.381 --> 00:12:44.686]  They're held to the special double standard that any Defense Department front group is allowed to carry.
[00:12:45.752 --> 00:12:51.375]  And they're just there to propagandize and push and condition until you're just sick of hearing about the Chibs and you just accept it.
[00:12:51.895 --> 00:12:54.516]  Psychological warfare running at different levels against you.
[00:12:55.997 --> 00:13:07.642]  And it was four and a half years ago, if memory serves, the AP broke it as well as I believe it was the St.
[00:13:07.682 --> 00:13:08.922]  Petersburg Times.
[00:13:09.362 --> 00:13:10.163]  I'm going from memory.
[00:13:10.503 --> 00:13:14.865]  I saw this this morning, called Paul, but he likes to take Friday nights off with his girlfriend.
[00:13:16.403 --> 00:13:18.944]  Saturday's off, so I guess I gotta write it myself.
[00:13:18.984 --> 00:13:19.964]  I'm trying to make two films.
[00:13:19.984 --> 00:13:27.547]  I'm trying to do second edition Terror Storm and Endgame right now and I'm not whining, I just am very mad that I can't do all this.
[00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:31.688]  So if somebody else go write it, fine, you get the scoop, as long as they get exposed.
[00:13:32.568 --> 00:13:33.769]  Go Google it, pull it up.
[00:13:35.369 --> 00:13:41.111]  They lied four and a half years ago and said that, I believe it was 50 plus hospitals,
[00:13:41.864 --> 00:13:47.248]  Mainly in Florida, had adopted the chip readers and were implanting their patients.
[00:13:48.488 --> 00:13:52.491]  The media called those hospitals and the hospital said it was a complete lie.
[00:13:52.551 --> 00:13:53.952]  None of it was true and that was confirmed.
[00:13:55.433 --> 00:14:02.377]  They had that family, they called the Chipsons running around about how wonderful the chips were.
[00:14:03.158 --> 00:14:06.720]  The dad was a dentist and the kid was called Boy Genius by everybody.
[00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:11.835]  Of course, he just died last year in a motorcycle accident at what, 17?
[00:14:13.615 --> 00:14:14.376]  Back then he was like 13.
[00:14:14.756 --> 00:14:18.417]  It turned out, of course, they were employees of the company and stockholders.
[00:14:18.457 --> 00:14:20.197]  It was all a front.
[00:14:20.257 --> 00:14:21.057]  It's a black op.
[00:14:23.678 --> 00:14:27.419]  But I'm digressing because I'm trying to give you background here for the article, whoever's going to put it out.
[00:14:28.472 --> 00:14:30.113]  And that's basically what happens now with this show.
[00:14:30.833 --> 00:14:31.454]  I'm very honored.
[00:14:31.474 --> 00:14:34.515]  I'm glad that people are tuning in, checking out what I say, and then going and writing articles.
[00:14:34.535 --> 00:14:35.676]  Because we can't do it.
[00:14:35.696 --> 00:14:36.396]  We don't have the staff.
[00:14:36.817 --> 00:14:40.118]  If you're a listener and would like to go research and put it together and send it to us, I'm sure we'll post it.
[00:14:40.719 --> 00:14:45.941]  Send it to Ryan at Infowars.com, Aaron at Infowars.com, Kevin at Infowars.com.
[00:14:46.021 --> 00:14:47.662]  Somebody of those three will get it and post it.
[00:14:47.682 --> 00:14:51.945]  You can try sending it to Paul or Steve.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:02.481]  The point is, you can go find out they lied about this last time, and so I'd bet my bottom dollar, because I've never seen them not, basically everything they say is a lie.
[00:15:04.502 --> 00:15:07.702]  Somebody could call, of course they're crafty about not listing the hospitals.
[00:15:08.463 --> 00:15:11.523]  Somebody could call the hospitals and see indeed if they are doing that.
[00:15:11.563 --> 00:15:14.524]  That would take just a few hours of your time.
[00:15:15.604 --> 00:15:21.125]  Just call and just, you know, ask the hospital director, say you're with Sunrise News or
[00:15:22.188 --> 00:15:24.989]  Whatever you want to say the name of your group is, and if that's the name, that's the name.
[00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:26.630]  And just find out if it's true.
[00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:30.592]  Of course it'll be a lie, but... Or maybe things are worse than I thought.
[00:15:30.612 --> 00:15:37.816]  Maybe they've finally, by bluffing and hyping, gotten this done, but... I'd bet my bottom dollar that's not the case.
[00:15:38.196 --> 00:15:40.658]  Verichip passed a significant milestone.
[00:15:41.158 --> 00:15:47.041]  Over 500 hospitals have now agreed to adopt Veramed patient identification system.
[00:15:48.627 --> 00:15:59.958]  Veritib Corporation, a provider of RFID systems and health care and patient-related needs, announced today that 65 new hospitals, so see it's 500 and by the next line it's 65.
[00:16:00.738 --> 00:16:01.659]  These people are sick.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:14.171]  New hospitals have agreed to participate in the new Veramed Patient Identification System Network at the American Academy of Emergency Medicine, AAEM, 13th Annual Scientific Academy Conference in Las Vegas.
[00:16:16.002 --> 00:16:18.564]  Now, last time they said they had contracts, it turned out it was a whole lie.
[00:16:18.604 --> 00:16:20.785]  Maybe they got a room to say, who's interested?
[00:16:20.805 --> 00:16:24.067]  And maybe, you know, they just claimed 65 hands went up.
[00:16:24.507 --> 00:16:25.608]  They're getting a little bit slicker.
[00:16:27.289 --> 00:16:33.933]  And it goes on, the 13th Annual Scientific Assembly Conference in Las Vegas, bringing the company's total number of enrolled hospitals to more than 500.
[00:16:35.094 --> 00:16:41.758]  Scott R. Silverman, who we've interviewed, Chairman and CEO of Verichip, commented, we are very pleased to add 65 new hospitals to the network.
[00:16:42.539 --> 00:16:44.140]  The network that's been proven to be a complete lie.
[00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.211]  Now, they've got a few police chiefs on the payroll.
[00:16:47.251 --> 00:16:50.432]  We've had one of them on who says he will try to enforce everyone taking the chip.
[00:16:51.852 --> 00:16:53.853]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:16:53.873 --> 00:16:55.153]  We're living in a fruitcake land.
[00:16:56.374 --> 00:16:57.514]  These people do whatever they're told.
[00:16:57.534 --> 00:17:10.838]  The Verichip patient identification system, which consists of a radio frequency identification scanner, an implantable RFID microchip, and a secure patient database is being used to help rapidly identify and provide access to important health information
[00:17:11.952 --> 00:17:20.721]  And again, every day I see a local or national newscast, the same lines, almost the same words, they're following a script.
[00:17:21.121 --> 00:17:23.503]  This is a massive program of propaganda.
[00:17:24.084 --> 00:17:28.088]  Well, here's a New York propaganda piece we never got to a few weeks ago.
[00:17:28.108 --> 00:17:30.510]  Again, every day we see these.
[00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:35.395]  This is the standard deal, word for word, out of the bowels of the Defense Department, here it is.
[00:17:36.019 --> 00:17:38.980]  Doctors want to place a computer chip under your skin.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.140]  Sound bizarre?
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.440]  It could save your life.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.161]  You're watching Fox 5 News at 10.
[00:17:45.961 --> 00:17:48.182]  What New Yorkers Watch.
[00:17:48.462 --> 00:17:49.402]  Works for shopping.
[00:17:50.083 --> 00:17:52.723]  If some have their way, you'll be scammed too.
[00:17:53.283 --> 00:17:54.043]  Find out why.
[00:17:54.524 --> 00:17:55.784]  Coming up in just a few minutes.
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.901]  It's hard to wrap your brain around all the technology available today.
[00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:03.482]  Imagine having your entire medical history embedded under your skin.
[00:18:03.502 --> 00:18:04.722]  Sounds great, right?
[00:18:04.762 --> 00:18:06.603]  Well, you haven't heard the other side.
[00:18:06.663 --> 00:18:09.184]  Dr. Steve Salvatore takes a look at the verichip.
[00:18:09.944 --> 00:18:16.146]  There's a couple times I've been put in the hospital and I was unable to communicate that I was a diabetic and what medications I was on.
[00:18:16.886 --> 00:18:20.127]  Molly Phillips hopes her worst nightmare never happens again.
[00:18:20.794 --> 00:18:28.277]  To make sure, she had a new device called the VeraChip, a computer chip about the size of a grain of rice placed under her skin.
[00:18:28.497 --> 00:18:32.018]  The VeraChip is the device in which we have programmed into it a number.
[00:18:33.018 --> 00:18:36.279]  A regular serial number which is matched to a database.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.481]  It goes on saying it's going to save your life, you've got to get it, it's wonderful.
[00:18:40.501 --> 00:18:43.662]  We've got it up on InfoWars and PresentPlan in the video section.
[00:18:44.429 --> 00:18:45.470]  And it's the same thing.
[00:18:45.931 --> 00:18:48.714]  Hey, you simpering nanny state lady!
[00:18:49.074 --> 00:18:52.138]  Why don't you just wear a bracelet with a number they can put in a computer?
[00:18:52.638 --> 00:18:56.002]  And why don't you wear a dog tag, which normal people do?
[00:18:56.362 --> 00:19:01.027]  Or why don't you get a tattoo with your precious number like a concentration camp victim?
[00:19:01.588 --> 00:19:04.751]  It's just that... I need people to help me.
[00:19:05.945 --> 00:19:14.089]  Don't you understand, of course there could be some uses for this, but it's being pushed and being implemented to control for buying and selling.
[00:19:14.509 --> 00:19:15.169]  It's bad.
[00:19:15.189 --> 00:19:18.831]  Do you understand, you people that think the government loves you and they're going to take care of you?
[00:19:19.231 --> 00:19:24.473]  They only set up big nanny state to domesticate you and turn you into a bunch of ignoramuses.
[00:19:25.173 --> 00:19:33.557]  Now they've done it, now your kids are a bunch of animals, drooling and watching television and playing video games, getting their diabetes from drinking 10 Cokes a day.
[00:19:35.501 --> 00:19:37.923]  You're just being set up to be exterminated, okay?
[00:19:38.903 --> 00:19:52.393]  And when you're flopping around in your inner cities when they're releasing bioweapons ten years from now, and we don't turn this around, I want you as you vomit your guts out as your dead children lay around you to remember I warned you and we tried to turn this around.
[00:19:52.973 --> 00:19:54.154]  You stupid hog!
[00:19:54.534 --> 00:19:55.255]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:00.956 --> 00:20:06.038]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:20:06.098 --> 00:20:13.420]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:24.183]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:20:24.404 --> 00:20:28.945]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:20:29.225 --> 00:20:34.210]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.372]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:37.593 --> 00:20:47.261]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:20:47.361 --> 00:20:49.122]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:20:49.142 --> 00:20:54.425]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:20:54.485 --> 00:20:56.446]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:20:56.466 --> 00:20:57.907]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:22.752]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:23.692 --> 00:21:30.936]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:31.937 --> 00:21:34.999]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:35.239 --> 00:21:40.622]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:21:41.603 --> 00:21:42.883]  Call for your copy today.
[00:21:42.903 --> 00:21:43.103]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.369 --> 00:21:52.216]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:21:52.697 --> 00:21:52.897]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.917 --> 00:21:53.298]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:03.863]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.603 --> 00:22:08.246]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[00:22:08.866 --> 00:22:12.748]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[00:22:13.449 --> 00:22:22.034]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[00:22:22.995 --> 00:22:30.140]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:39.217]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:40.318 --> 00:22:42.820]  Just call our toll-free order line number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.641]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:44.021]  Call now.
[00:22:44.041 --> 00:22:47.684]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:23:01.894 --> 00:23:03.955]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:04.575 --> 00:23:13.499]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:21.143]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:21.855 --> 00:23:27.359]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:23:27.839 --> 00:23:38.667]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:23:39.428 --> 00:23:41.489]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.411]  For more information, call 702-953-0202.
[00:23:46.613 --> 00:23:50.315]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio
[00:24:15.641 --> 00:24:25.323]  Oh, hey, let me shift gears before I get into Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
[00:24:27.444 --> 00:24:43.207]  Last night, I was driving over here to the office to do some work at about, I don't know, about 8 o'clock, and as I pull up to the office, one of my employees is pulled over in the parking lot, and there's
[00:24:44.048 --> 00:24:54.233]  Three cops standing there and I walk up and they're putting handcuffs on him for a expired driver's license.
[00:24:54.293 --> 00:25:02.778]  Now they just say they have to arrest people for any reason, just like they're arresting folks for no seat belt, the big famous case from here in Austin a few years ago.
[00:25:05.119 --> 00:25:12.303]  And I walk up and the cops are acting all scared because somebody's walking up to them, my gosh, and all of a sudden they go, big black cop,
[00:25:13.013 --> 00:25:16.175]  I've met 15 years ago at a gas station.
[00:25:16.336 --> 00:25:17.376]  He told me he was a fan.
[00:25:17.396 --> 00:25:17.596]  Not 15.
[00:25:17.757 --> 00:25:19.778]  It was like 13.
[00:25:19.898 --> 00:25:22.280]  Right when I first... I didn't have my own show then.
[00:25:23.183 --> 00:25:24.284]  I've just been on a few times.
[00:25:24.344 --> 00:25:26.986]  Because he lived over in the same apartments I did.
[00:25:27.006 --> 00:25:27.887]  So I've met him a few times.
[00:25:27.907 --> 00:25:29.669]  And I saw him all these years later.
[00:25:29.689 --> 00:25:31.150]  He goes, I'm about to retire.
[00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.292]  There they are handcuffing one of my employees.
[00:25:33.792 --> 00:25:34.553]  Oh, I'm about to retire.
[00:25:34.573 --> 00:25:35.154]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:25:35.174 --> 00:25:36.815]  And they put him in the car and drive off.
[00:25:36.855 --> 00:25:40.518]  And the cops are sitting there for 20 minutes telling me how much they like the radio show.
[00:25:40.558 --> 00:25:41.379]  And they like this guest.
[00:25:41.399 --> 00:25:42.200]  And they like that guest.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.701]  And they know America's gone.
[00:25:43.741 --> 00:25:44.362]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:25:44.982 --> 00:25:46.404]  You know, isn't it sad?
[00:25:47.204 --> 00:25:48.385]  And yeah, they're real sorry.
[00:25:48.405 --> 00:25:49.967]  They just have to arrest everybody now.
[00:25:51.664 --> 00:25:55.386]  But there was a female Hispanic cop, a black cop, and a white cop.
[00:25:55.426 --> 00:26:02.949]  And it was the female Hispanic cop that pulled him over and then never said why she pulled him over, by the way.
[00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:13.214]  Once he was pulled over, and he happened to be pulled over right in front of the office here on the main thoroughfare in Austin, she put him in handcuffs and that was the end of it.
[00:26:14.875 --> 00:26:16.856]  And we're getting him out of jail right now.
[00:26:18.613 --> 00:26:23.135]  But, I mean, this is the type of incredible stuff that goes on in America.
[00:26:24.456 --> 00:26:29.298]  Because I said to the female cop, and I would have said this if she'd have been purple, but she was Hispanic.
[00:26:30.218 --> 00:26:34.760]  I said, hey, let me guess, if he was an illegal alien, he wouldn't be going to jail right now.
[00:26:35.621 --> 00:26:38.522]  And she just smiled at me and drove off with him.
[00:26:39.602 --> 00:26:42.384]  And then I heard talking to the other cops, and they go, it's crazy.
[00:26:42.424 --> 00:26:43.344]  They go, you're right.
[00:26:44.207 --> 00:26:57.011]  We're told to accept the Mexican driver's license, the Mexican consular matricula, which everybody knows is fake, and we're told if they don't even have a license, give them a ticket under whatever name they say, and then the judges are told just let them go.
[00:26:57.031 --> 00:27:00.793]  Now, that's been in the Houston Chronicle, it's been in the Statesman, it's been all... everybody knows that.
[00:27:01.113 --> 00:27:10.676]  But to be talking to police, and they go, yeah, we're told to arrest citizens for any reason, zero tolerance, but... and then the white cop drove off.
[00:27:11.798 --> 00:27:37.607]  He had to go to a call, he was a sergeant, and then a black cop goes, and he was telling me how he was about to retire, and how he's got this band and all this stuff, and how he knows it's all horrible, and he leans over and he goes, yeah, and let me just tell you, it's true, because I, you know, he goes, I talk to Hispanic officers, they say that, well, they know how it was for, you know, their grandpa or whatever, you know, wanting to get deported, so they all stick together.
[00:27:38.268 --> 00:27:39.128]  And so do the judges.
[00:27:41.337 --> 00:27:42.518]  I mean, think about that.
[00:27:42.558 --> 00:27:49.961]  When you've got a group actually above the law, but everybody else, citizens, that would have been a Hispanic U.S.
[00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:51.221]  citizen, jailed.
[00:27:52.322 --> 00:27:55.503]  Black citizen, Chinese citizen, jailed.
[00:27:56.584 --> 00:27:57.264]  It doesn't matter.
[00:27:58.504 --> 00:28:00.145]  I mean, it's such a joke.
[00:28:00.285 --> 00:28:01.146]  We're the mark.
[00:28:01.266 --> 00:28:02.306]  We're the right whale.
[00:28:02.906 --> 00:28:07.868]  And again, the right whale was a slow, sweet, curious whale, almost extinct.
[00:28:07.988 --> 00:28:09.069]  Now it's come back a little bit.
[00:28:10.133 --> 00:28:11.294]  I mean, very affectionate.
[00:28:11.314 --> 00:28:14.835]  They come up to divers and nudge you and look at you and play with you.
[00:28:14.875 --> 00:28:15.715]  They're huge whales.
[00:28:15.735 --> 00:28:16.436]  A lot of oil.
[00:28:17.016 --> 00:28:18.937]  And they were the ones that whalers went after.
[00:28:20.658 --> 00:28:21.298]  Poor things.
[00:28:23.299 --> 00:28:26.580]  And we're the right whale.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.201]  We are the cattle.
[00:28:28.361 --> 00:28:29.381]  We are the mark.
[00:28:29.501 --> 00:28:30.381]  We are the idiots.
[00:28:30.802 --> 00:28:31.762]  We are the fools.
[00:28:32.022 --> 00:28:33.043]  Because we think we're free.
[00:28:34.363 --> 00:28:35.664]  And again, there's an incentive.
[00:28:35.824 --> 00:28:38.765]  More health care, more welfare, more everything for the illegals.
[00:28:39.764 --> 00:28:45.486]  Predominantly Latin Americans, but now South Koreans are coming here to have anchor babies, by the way, by the tens of thousands.
[00:28:45.526 --> 00:28:46.067]  Now they learn.
[00:28:46.247 --> 00:28:53.490]  They fly in in their third trimester, they get a visa as a tourist, and they come in the last month of that third trimester, boom!
[00:28:54.230 --> 00:29:01.053]  Then they can bring hundreds of members of their family in the chain here, total welfare, in the tens of thousands a year.
[00:29:02.093 --> 00:29:02.894]  And do you blame them?
[00:29:04.412 --> 00:29:14.237]  And the central banks, just like they mail credit cards out to you when you're broke, but when you're not broke they don't mail them to you, it's about running the country itself into total bankruptcy and total debt.
[00:29:14.537 --> 00:29:30.326]  Bring on as many as you can, do whatever you want, have clear channel, own Spanish speaking stations, calling for revolution and violent takeover, balkanize, break down, and oh my gosh, you've got an expired license, you're going to jail.
[00:29:32.265 --> 00:29:33.706]  You don't have your seatbelt on.
[00:29:33.746 --> 00:29:34.968]  You're going to jail.
[00:29:34.988 --> 00:29:37.089]  But you're an illegal alien?
[00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:39.071]  There's no stopping you.
[00:29:39.131 --> 00:29:41.553]  You are literally above the law.
[00:29:42.194 --> 00:29:42.995]  I witnessed it.
[00:29:43.295 --> 00:29:44.916]  And the cops just said it was incredible.
[00:29:45.337 --> 00:29:45.797]  They agreed.
[00:29:51.342 --> 00:29:52.283]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.743 --> 00:29:54.345]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.365 --> 00:29:57.948]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.294 --> 00:30:05.394]  Does this sound bring on a sudden onset of fear?
[00:30:05.855 --> 00:30:07.755]  A fear of not knowing who's on the other end?
[00:30:08.055 --> 00:30:12.496]  Do you avoid picking up the phone knowing it's just going to be another harassing phone call from a debt collector?
[00:30:12.656 --> 00:30:17.117]  Do you resent your daily trips to the mailbox knowing it will be flooded with notices from creditors?
[00:30:17.437 --> 00:30:20.378]  Over 1 million credit card holders will declare bankruptcy this year.
[00:30:20.618 --> 00:30:22.978]  Learn how to legally eliminate your credit card debt.
[00:30:23.138 --> 00:30:23.719]  Want to know more?
[00:30:23.939 --> 00:30:24.219]  Call 920-293-8024.
[00:30:24.319 --> 00:30:24.619]  That's 920-293-8024.
[00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:34.490]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:36.871]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:30:37.592 --> 00:30:40.773]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:30:41.414 --> 00:30:47.877]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:31:32.301 --> 00:31:35.383]  Northern Voice Bookstore offers a broad range of different perspectives
[00:31:35.503 --> 00:31:35.763]  I think so.
[00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:01.510]  Hey, Emily.
[00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:02.630]  Wow, you look great.
[00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:03.671]  I feel great.
[00:32:04.131 --> 00:32:05.751]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:06.591]  Really?
[00:32:06.851 --> 00:32:07.291]  What is it?
[00:32:07.451 --> 00:32:07.892]  How does it work?
[00:32:08.172 --> 00:32:14.433]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[00:32:14.773 --> 00:32:16.834]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[00:32:17.234 --> 00:32:22.695]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[00:32:22.915 --> 00:32:23.315]  That's it?
[00:32:23.735 --> 00:32:25.216]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[00:32:25.556 --> 00:32:26.216]  It is easy.
[00:32:26.657 --> 00:32:32.980]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.581]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[00:32:35.001 --> 00:32:35.641]  That's amazing!
[00:32:36.001 --> 00:32:40.844]  And, the bentonite clay and medicalins eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:32:41.284 --> 00:32:41.584]  Wow!
[00:32:41.865 --> 00:32:42.845]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[00:32:43.106 --> 00:32:45.868]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[00:32:45.948 --> 00:32:49.591]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[00:32:49.831 --> 00:32:53.054]  For only $26.90, MediCleanse is shipped directly to you.
[00:32:53.434 --> 00:32:53.794]  Or call 1-800-317-9547.
[00:32:53.814 --> 00:32:54.015]  That's 800-317-9547.
[00:33:23.025 --> 00:33:42.695]  You see, when you read an article, and I literally see scores of them every day from Canada to England, and now they're setting it up here,
[00:33:45.679 --> 00:33:51.621]  Oh, a reporter arrested for saying that homosexuality isn't healthy.
[00:33:52.562 --> 00:33:53.922]  Oh, I mean that just happened again.
[00:33:53.942 --> 00:34:00.545]  I'm not talking about the famous BBC case with a reporter just saying the word homosexual is illegal in England because it's considered a slang term.
[00:34:01.394 --> 00:34:10.880]  It's about setting a precedent that they can take real words that just mean things, that are semantical, verbal, audible symbols, and make them illegal.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:16.323]  It's literally a speech crime, a thought crime, because words are translated into the brain as thoughts.
[00:34:18.504 --> 00:34:19.564]  This is total control.
[00:34:21.245 --> 00:34:25.288]  And when they say, oh, we're banning in schools the reading of The Three Little Pigs,
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:37.121]  Because it hurts Muslims' feelings that globalists are making race-specific bio-weapons for the Arabs, the predominant group in the center of Islam.
[00:34:37.953 --> 00:34:38.493]  They don't.
[00:34:39.013 --> 00:34:45.034]  Again, they set that precedent for everyone, and then again, foolish Muslims are going to support it.
[00:34:45.354 --> 00:34:52.816]  And then they go to another quote minority group or special interest group and, oh, we're going to get rid of the borders for you, the Hispanics, because that's what you want.
[00:34:53.136 --> 00:34:55.956]  That matter of almost 70% of Hispanics and Poles don't want that.
[00:34:56.156 --> 00:35:03.498]  They tell you that's what you want, and then they do it because the big banks want to break down our border and have 500 million people here just in the next 15 years.
[00:35:05.057 --> 00:35:08.840]  Because they want to drive down the wages and get everybody fighting with each other and vulcanize us.
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.902]  Bring on so many people they can't be melted into the pot.
[00:35:13.503 --> 00:35:16.384]  Everything is sophisticated psychological warfare!
[00:35:16.545 --> 00:35:17.665]  It's admitted!
[00:35:18.166 --> 00:35:19.587]  That's the incredible part!
[00:35:19.647 --> 00:35:27.372]  They've got literally tens of thousands of top psychiatrists with 170 IQs admittedly writing up how to do this!
[00:35:27.492 --> 00:35:28.432]  It's all public!
[00:35:31.434 --> 00:35:33.836]  That's what's incredible, is that they admit it!
[00:35:36.144 --> 00:35:38.365]  And we're just destroying ourselves.
[00:35:38.406 --> 00:35:40.207]  We're allowing them to do this to us.
[00:35:43.449 --> 00:35:44.789]  And it just makes my head spin.
[00:35:44.809 --> 00:36:03.341]  You know, they claim that it's all about equality, but now the Hispanic cop with relish is going to arrest the white guy for a expired license and then snicker about how the illegals aren't arrested for not having one.
[00:36:07.245 --> 00:36:08.286]  And this is how it works.
[00:36:08.386 --> 00:36:13.931]  Well, your grandpas and grandmas, they were mean to us.
[00:36:13.971 --> 00:36:15.132]  They were tribal to us.
[00:36:15.513 --> 00:36:22.099]  And so now we're a bunch of liberal, buck-toothed white people walking around all guilty, going, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:36:22.299 --> 00:36:23.520]  Hey, I haven't done anything to anybody.
[00:36:25.169 --> 00:36:31.795]  I've been to Hispanic folks' homes when the CPS was dragging their kids off, and their local Hispanic leaders aren't going to help them.
[00:36:31.955 --> 00:36:35.358]  They're all on the payroll, just like the white leaders, the black leaders, and everybody else.
[00:36:35.538 --> 00:36:36.659]  Yeah, I made the point yesterday.
[00:36:36.899 --> 00:36:42.765]  Blacks need to stop getting mad about somebody using the N-word and freaking out over it, and just say, I don't care what you call me.
[00:36:43.705 --> 00:36:50.011]  And start worrying about CPS grabbing your kids and testing bioweapons and pesticides and drugs on them.
[00:36:53.357 --> 00:36:55.599]  You ought to be storming those CPS offices.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.681]  I'll be right there with you.
[00:36:58.302 --> 00:37:03.226]  You see, the media and the government know how to get you all hyped up over petty stuff that doesn't matter.
[00:37:04.147 --> 00:37:08.952]  And then meanwhile, they're literally killing all of us and hurting all of us and enslaving all of us.
[00:37:10.157 --> 00:37:16.063]  And you've got the whites going around a bunch of self-centered twits thinking they're the masters and the rulers.
[00:37:16.523 --> 00:37:18.565]  Because the media set that up in the 60s and 70s.
[00:37:18.885 --> 00:37:20.086]  Oh, Whitey owns the buildings.
[00:37:20.307 --> 00:37:21.428]  Whitey owns the airplanes.
[00:37:21.728 --> 00:37:23.389]  Whitey owns the insurance companies.
[00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:24.831]  Whitey owns the roads.
[00:37:27.032 --> 00:37:32.254]  I've been watching a lot of, you know, quote, black militants back in the 60s and 70s, their speeches, and, you know, Whitey owns everything!
[00:37:32.474 --> 00:37:40.158]  You mean select Whitey, you mean a few Whiteys, and you mean a bunch of other Whiteys, then think, buy into that propaganda that they're part of that, but they're not!
[00:37:40.518 --> 00:37:43.219]  And so, look, I'm just a human being, and I want freedom.
[00:37:43.399 --> 00:37:46.040]  And I know you're gonna have to be free if I'm gonna be free.
[00:37:46.221 --> 00:37:47.221]  So get off of it!
[00:37:47.381 --> 00:37:51.383]  You racist Mexicans, you racist whites, you racist blacks, all of you!
[00:37:51.603 --> 00:37:53.084]  You're playing right into their plan!
[00:37:53.304 --> 00:37:56.245]  And by the way, being against tribalism and racism,
[00:37:57.375 --> 00:37:59.416]  Because like it or not, we're all mixed in together now.
[00:38:00.437 --> 00:38:05.860]  Being against it means you stop constantly obsessing on it and being into it and whining about it.
[00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.160]  You just get over it!
[00:38:10.202 --> 00:38:10.882]  Unbelievable!
[00:38:12.343 --> 00:38:13.123]  Unbelievable!
[00:38:14.384 --> 00:38:17.166]  Jesse Jackson and the rest of the black leaders make me sick.
[00:38:17.506 --> 00:38:19.387]  They never talk about any real issues.
[00:38:21.081 --> 00:38:25.284]  They don't talk about AIDS being engineered, killing literally over 100 million blacks.
[00:38:25.645 --> 00:38:27.426]  They never talk about what they're putting in the vaccines.
[00:38:27.626 --> 00:38:29.267]  They never talk about real issues.
[00:38:29.448 --> 00:38:32.010]  They never talk about what the government's doing to your kids right now.
[00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:33.451]  How they're breaking up your families.
[00:38:33.631 --> 00:38:35.492]  The few black families that can try to survive.
[00:38:35.692 --> 00:38:39.756]  The few single parent families that try to operate have got the government all over them.
[00:38:40.456 --> 00:38:42.778]  You know, people are so broke in this country, by the way.
[00:38:43.493 --> 00:38:50.355]  Even folks I know that have got college, multiple college degrees, can't even hardly pay their tickets off just from the few tickets they get.
[00:38:50.635 --> 00:38:52.456]  This whole country's falling apart!
[00:38:53.416 --> 00:39:06.681]  And the sooner we realize that... Look, people used to be pretty self-sufficient and upright, and the system saw that as a threat, so they went in, by design, to make society dependent and to break down society, and they did a darn good job of it.
[00:39:08.441 --> 00:39:12.943]  I'm already ranting, and I haven't even gotten into Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, I just...
[00:39:16.231 --> 00:39:17.392]  I just want you to be happy.
[00:39:17.512 --> 00:39:18.473]  I want you to do good.
[00:39:19.054 --> 00:39:20.615]  I like people being successful.
[00:39:22.116 --> 00:39:25.419]  I'm just a normal person, I think.
[00:39:25.519 --> 00:39:27.141]  Most people are jealous and envious.
[00:39:27.161 --> 00:39:28.402]  They want to tear everybody down.
[00:39:28.963 --> 00:39:31.205]  It's just a bunch of greedy creatures all over the place.
[00:39:32.085 --> 00:39:34.227]  And then the good people sit on their hands and do nothing.
[00:39:34.247 --> 00:39:35.048]  We're in deep trouble.
[00:39:37.105 --> 00:39:42.049]  And almost every cop I talk to in Austin goes, yeah, I know the system's bad, I know it's all screwed up, but what am I going to do?
[00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:43.350]  I've got to get my pension.
[00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.312]  Listen, you're not going to be getting your pension the way things are going, okay?
[00:39:47.052 --> 00:39:49.134]  You can guarantee that, or you're going to get a fraction of it.
[00:39:50.615 --> 00:39:52.436]  And it's just getting worse and worse.
[00:39:52.636 --> 00:39:56.940]  I just cannot believe how bad... And there's still a lot of good in the world.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.100]  That's what makes me so upset.
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.882]  But the evil is in all the high places.
[00:40:02.644 --> 00:40:04.225]  Okay, let me get into the news here.
[00:40:05.268 --> 00:40:06.929]  The really important news.
[00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:09.651]  I am heartened by what's happened.
[00:40:11.993 --> 00:40:26.984]  On Wednesday, the news was announced that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, in custody since early 2003, that's almost four years, had confessed to all these things.
[00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:28.065]  And I immediately
[00:40:29.025 --> 00:40:34.087]  Went and read what he confessed to and said, wait a minute, Al-Qaeda wasn't even supposedly operating in 93.
[00:40:34.607 --> 00:40:36.848]  The government cooked the bomb, trained the driver in the bombing.
[00:40:37.088 --> 00:40:38.088]  That's totally fake.
[00:40:39.229 --> 00:40:47.792]  I then started noticing, and I remember reading over the 50-something page, uh, highly rejected, uh, supposed testimony.
[00:40:47.812 --> 00:40:48.733]  You can't even believe that.
[00:40:49.173 --> 00:40:51.494]  That the government even, you know, I mean, he even said all these things.
[00:40:51.514 --> 00:40:52.474]  It's a secret tribunal.
[00:40:53.374 --> 00:40:58.756]  Torture camp, concentration camp, I mean just on its face it's all inadmissible, it's all a fraud, it's all a lie.
[00:40:58.936 --> 00:41:01.116]  But I mean let's just address the so-called facts in it.
[00:41:01.136 --> 00:41:10.679]  I remember reading in there that he supposedly was involved in planning to bomb a bank at a certain facility that didn't even exist until 2006.
[00:41:12.039 --> 00:41:14.400]  He'd been in jail, he'd been in a camp for three years.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.540]  So now it's all unraveling.
[00:41:17.161 --> 00:41:19.021]  And everyone is saying it's fake.
[00:41:19.821 --> 00:41:21.922]  Even the debunkers aren't defending this now.
[00:41:23.809 --> 00:41:27.352]  Here's Time Magazine yesterday, can KSM's confession be believed?
[00:41:27.372 --> 00:41:28.413]  And it goes on to say it can't.
[00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:32.076]  Matt Lauer, can Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's torture testimony be trusted?
[00:41:32.316 --> 00:41:33.757]  He goes on to say absolutely not.
[00:41:34.979 --> 00:41:51.873]  You cannot trust a government that secretly arrests people, secretly tortures people, says that even if a tribunal finds you not guilty, they can still say you're guilty, says that torture testimony is admissible, admit they tortured him,
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:57.206]  And then they've been caught framing and lying and buying a billion eight in fake news.
[00:41:57.266 --> 00:41:59.770]  I kept saying a billion six, now a billion eight in that one year period.
[00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:05.838]  Buying off fake CIA people on Fox News, that's all come out.
[00:42:06.138 --> 00:42:08.201]  CNN, mainstream folks, back of the paper though.
[00:42:08.982 --> 00:42:10.264]  I mean, of course you can't buy it.
[00:42:12.663 --> 00:42:16.624]  It's like saying, well, the devil, you know, appeared to me and said Jesus was bad.
[00:42:16.644 --> 00:42:17.325]  Well, it's the devil.
[00:42:17.345 --> 00:42:18.405]  Are you going to believe the devil?
[00:42:18.905 --> 00:42:23.227]  I mean, it's dressed up in the red pajamas, folks, and with a pitchfork.
[00:42:23.767 --> 00:42:38.492]  I mean, there's no need to even, but then as you analyze it, it's shoddy and faulty, but it's tailored for that 30% or so who will believe anything they're told, who just, it needs to be like cartoon.
[00:42:39.463 --> 00:42:44.985]  And see, we aren't as dumb as they say we are, but they're giving us news to condition us and make us that way.
[00:42:45.266 --> 00:42:46.266]  This is a process.
[00:42:46.826 --> 00:42:51.528]  And if a lot of us have to see it's ridiculous propaganda for it to continue to dumb down the others, so be it!
[00:42:51.548 --> 00:42:52.629]  The establishment's decided.
[00:42:53.369 --> 00:42:59.472]  That's why they claim they killed Al-Zaqqari twelve plus times.
[00:42:59.512 --> 00:43:00.852]  That's why they claim they killed.
[00:43:01.633 --> 00:43:05.154]  And then they never retracted the last killing of him, or the last arrest.
[00:43:05.874 --> 00:43:07.175]  They're just practicing
[00:43:08.035 --> 00:43:12.477]  Just total deception in front of everyone and setting the precedent that there's not anything you can do about it.
[00:43:15.298 --> 00:43:19.379]  And then people choose, willfully, just to not have a memory and believe the lie.
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.721]  Matt Lauer, can Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's torture testimony be trusted?
[00:43:24.161 --> 00:43:25.421]  Absolutely not, they say.
[00:43:25.862 --> 00:43:30.503]  CNN had a poll, 74%, said they don't believe the KSM confession is real.
[00:43:30.863 --> 00:43:32.804]  They believe it was extracted by torture.
[00:43:33.985 --> 00:43:34.705]  That was out of
[00:43:38.842 --> 00:43:42.143]  16,000 plus votes.
[00:43:42.803 --> 00:43:43.663]  6,889 believe yes.
[00:43:43.683 --> 00:43:47.064]  74%, 19,406 say no.
[00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:51.345]  And that's what we always get.
[00:43:51.385 --> 00:43:57.787]  It's between 75% and 80% don't believe anything the government says now, or either party.
[00:43:58.527 --> 00:44:00.248]  And again, you've lost control, establishment.
[00:44:00.288 --> 00:44:02.928]  Ten years ago, it was always one party was in, one party was out.
[00:44:03.208 --> 00:44:04.289]  It was usually about 55% to
[00:44:05.999 --> 00:44:06.680]  Forty-five.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:07.861]  You've lost it.
[00:44:08.402 --> 00:44:09.443]  I know you know you've lost it.
[00:44:09.463 --> 00:44:10.764]  You're just going with brute force now.
[00:44:13.127 --> 00:44:16.371]  I just can't believe your technicians, because there's millions of them, go along with this.
[00:44:16.391 --> 00:44:19.194]  Because, I mean, a lot of them got to know now what they're part of.
[00:44:19.835 --> 00:44:22.096]  Enough of them have a reverse-engineered look around them.
[00:44:22.296 --> 00:44:23.297]  I don't know how we're doing this.
[00:44:23.497 --> 00:44:24.857]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:44:25.137 --> 00:44:28.919]  How do you take kids and take them to facilities and dump pesticide down their throats?
[00:44:29.219 --> 00:44:32.601]  New York Daily News admitted it comes out and nobody gets in trouble.
[00:44:32.801 --> 00:44:35.622]  They grab black kids and dump poison down their throats until they die.
[00:44:35.842 --> 00:44:38.803]  And you don't hear these filthy black leaders saying a thing!
[00:44:39.083 --> 00:44:42.465]  You don't hear the scumbag liberal white scum saying nothing!
[00:44:43.922 --> 00:44:44.863]  Because they're scum!
[00:44:45.023 --> 00:44:46.104]  They don't care, folks!
[00:44:46.264 --> 00:44:50.047]  They do what's politically correct, and they're advanced, and they get to be in a bigger house!
[00:44:58.835 --> 00:45:01.517]  Everybody gets to run around with a bunch of tribal tit-for-tat.
[00:45:02.818 --> 00:45:08.083]  The whites try to get it over on everybody because they feel like they're getting oppressed, and the blacks are doing it, and the Mexicans are doing it.
[00:45:10.041 --> 00:45:12.103]  Meanwhile, they're putting cancer viruses in your baby.
[00:45:12.304 --> 00:45:15.026]  It doesn't matter if you're black or Mexican or white.
[00:45:15.066 --> 00:45:16.468]  They're putting it in the shot!
[00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:19.971]  They're targeting you!
[00:45:19.991 --> 00:45:22.273]  Do you understand that, you idiot police?
[00:45:23.394 --> 00:45:30.161]  They put aspartame in over 9,000 foods for your family as the diabetes explodes because it destroys your pancreas.
[00:45:34.224 --> 00:45:35.204]  Do you understand that?
[00:45:35.224 --> 00:45:37.906]  Do you understand you're being attacked too?
[00:45:38.186 --> 00:45:39.887]  Can't you get that through your head?
[00:45:44.188 --> 00:45:47.250]  Officials, Mohammed exaggerated claims.
[00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:49.031]  Oh, the government's saying, well, I guess he did.
[00:45:49.051 --> 00:45:51.192]  It's unbelievable.
[00:45:51.452 --> 00:45:52.432]  And here's the really big one.
[00:45:52.452 --> 00:45:55.293]  And I literally got like 20-something different angles on this in front of me.
[00:45:58.155 --> 00:46:02.977]  KSM confession to attacking bank founded after his arrest.
[00:46:04.748 --> 00:46:11.693]  And by the way, this guy's talking in USA nomenclature, A to Z. He did several things like that.
[00:46:12.193 --> 00:46:18.058]  I mean, last night I sat up late reading this whole redacted affidavit.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:25.623]  And if it's a forgery by the government, it's really good.
[00:46:25.903 --> 00:46:31.347]  I tend to think this guy's so drugged out and so nuts when they finally got him up to testify before the judge.
[00:46:32.552 --> 00:46:40.321]  With no one in the room but an Air Force officer, and I won't even say who that is, this is Freedom, that he just began gibbering.
[00:46:43.144 --> 00:46:48.270]  And I work with the MI6 and the CIA told me, and then it's blacked out.
[00:46:49.191 --> 00:46:52.155]  And it's clear, it's always the same, he's some mental patient.
[00:46:52.768 --> 00:46:55.971]  Who they got to shoot his mouth off and he's the mastermind of Al Qaeda.
[00:46:56.371 --> 00:46:57.352]  It's the same M.O.
[00:46:57.432 --> 00:46:58.993]  in Miami, the same M.O.
[00:46:59.453 --> 00:47:02.296]  with the retarded street kids, the same M.O.
[00:47:02.516 --> 00:47:04.277]  in Toronto, the same M.O.
[00:47:04.738 --> 00:47:05.298]  in England.
[00:47:05.999 --> 00:47:06.559]  It's over.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:12.844]  The two guys on New York Welfare, both retarded, bombed the World Trade Center the first time, FBI took the bomb, framed the driver.
[00:47:13.585 --> 00:47:14.826]  I mean it's just always the same.
[00:47:17.173 --> 00:47:24.837]  Because this is so shoddy, it's like they tortured him, stuck him out there, and the government's so lazy, they just, I don't know, this stuff's getting too sophisticated for me.
[00:47:25.558 --> 00:47:29.100]  I mean, this is, this is, and that's what they do, they make it just, black ops is like this.
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:30.881]  You just know it's bull, okay?
[00:47:34.179 --> 00:47:37.301]  Fallacy of testimony exposed as story blows up in Pentagon's face.
[00:47:37.341 --> 00:47:49.510]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's alleged confession testimony has been thoroughly discredited after it emerged that one of the targets he identified, the bank plaza, the plaza bank was not founded until 2006, four years after the alleged Al-Qaeda mastermind's arrest.
[00:47:50.271 --> 00:48:01.073]  In his confession, KSM claims I was responsible for planning, training, surveying, and finalizing the new or second wave of attacks against the following skyscrapers after 9-11.
[00:48:01.593 --> 00:48:03.333]  Bank Plaza, Washington State.
[00:48:03.673 --> 00:48:05.954]  KSM was arrested in March 2003.
[00:48:06.194 --> 00:48:16.236]  According to Bank Plaza's website, the organization was founded in early 2006, making it impossible for KSM to have known the bank's existence before 2003, never mind plotting against it.
[00:48:16.616 --> 00:48:18.776]  The whole thing's complete bull.
[00:48:19.276 --> 00:48:29.394]  We believe that this oath could run 30-something attacks and plant hundreds of others, but our government couldn't!
[00:48:30.129 --> 00:48:33.651]  The government couldn't do something so sophisticated, but this guy can!
[00:48:33.971 --> 00:48:38.354]  And of course, then we go into the fact that he was MI6, and that he was allowed back into the U.S.
[00:48:38.394 --> 00:48:38.794]  and England.
[00:48:39.174 --> 00:48:41.856]  He's another one of the guys the embassies wouldn't let him in, they were told.
[00:48:42.216 --> 00:48:43.557]  He's a government agent, let him in.
[00:48:44.337 --> 00:48:45.238]  It's the same stuff.
[00:48:45.438 --> 00:48:46.839]  It's come out that he's MI6.
[00:48:47.599 --> 00:48:51.762]  It's come out just like the leader of the 7-7 bombs, and that's just the patsies.
[00:48:53.286 --> 00:48:58.048]  was known MI6 and they arrested him in Africa and MI6 got him and let him go.
[00:48:58.108 --> 00:48:59.888]  I mean, these people never stop!
[00:49:00.648 --> 00:49:01.909]  Stop blowing up buses!
[00:49:01.929 --> 00:49:03.429]  Stop blowing up schools!
[00:49:03.769 --> 00:49:07.350]  Stop killing us and then prancing around talking about how you're taking care of us!
[00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:08.851]  There's a reason you're the Empire!
[00:49:09.011 --> 00:49:10.291]  There's a reason you're in control!
[00:49:10.451 --> 00:49:10.971]  There's a reason!
[00:49:11.052 --> 00:49:14.232]  Because you are the most murdering, deceptive people on the planet!
[00:49:14.913 --> 00:49:22.175]  You drop cluster bombs on people, you've got all sorts of incredible bio-weapons, you're involved in every evil, and that's why they're on top, folks!
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:26.860]  Oh, man.
[00:49:29.121 --> 00:49:30.301]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:49:30.761 --> 00:49:40.824]  I mean, this is just... You know, I think they probably released this because claiming that they killed Al Zakari and others, it was over 12 times.
[00:49:44.185 --> 00:49:47.786]  That the media never, because most of it's controlled, never covered that.
[00:49:49.066 --> 00:49:52.507]  I mean, over and over again, they'd kill him every few months and then never retract the last killing.
[00:49:53.268 --> 00:49:54.408]  It's just incredible!
[00:49:55.054 --> 00:49:55.935]  Incredible lie!
[00:49:56.035 --> 00:49:56.875]  So transparent!
[00:49:58.116 --> 00:50:10.343]  And then I guess they just thought they could just have this guy come out and claim that he nailed Christ on the cross, and that he pierced his side, and that he killed the dinosaurs, and, you know, he did everything, and then people would just buy this!
[00:50:11.023 --> 00:50:16.767]  They've got one guy who's been in a torture dungeon for four years, where they admit they torture people.
[00:50:16.787 --> 00:50:22.050]  I mean, again, that is
[00:50:23.726 --> 00:50:25.346]  thrown out on its face.
[00:50:25.706 --> 00:50:26.867]  And then you go look at the claims.
[00:50:27.887 --> 00:50:30.407]  Anyone with two brain cells are rubbed together knows it's a fraud.
[00:50:32.668 --> 00:50:38.229]  I don't even... This is the type of day where I get on air and I'm like, what is even the point?
[00:50:38.669 --> 00:50:40.810]  I mean, how can the population not see it?
[00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:42.910]  How can you not see it?
[00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:44.610]  It's so incredible.
[00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:46.331]  And the truth is you do see it.
[00:50:46.371 --> 00:50:47.291]  You are awakening.
[00:50:47.571 --> 00:50:52.232]  You just feel powerless and you don't see yourselves as leaders when you figure out you've got power.
[00:50:52.879 --> 00:50:54.300]  We're gonna take these people down.
[00:50:54.621 --> 00:50:59.084]  All you've got to do is turn yourselves loose, and we're gonna bring them to justice!
[00:51:00.946 --> 00:51:07.211]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:07.552 --> 00:51:09.493]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:09.874 --> 00:51:17.480]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:25.242]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.643 --> 00:51:37.066]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.386 --> 00:51:41.308]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.328 --> 00:51:43.288]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.609 --> 00:51:47.470]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:00.811 --> 00:52:01.572]  Terrorism!
[00:52:01.712 --> 00:52:02.473]  Terrorism!
[00:52:02.573 --> 00:52:08.638]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:52:08.898 --> 00:52:10.500]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:13.222]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:52:13.602 --> 00:52:20.929]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron.

[00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:59.021]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:09.833]  Just boil it down and try to make it real simple.
[00:54:12.516 --> 00:54:28.551]  The development of humankind, our entire future, everything we've been, we are, and that we could be, is being captured and sequestered by a greedy, inbred group of sadistic, maniacal control freaks.
[00:54:30.282 --> 00:54:43.330]  They are literally, diabolically punching the buttons in our psyches of every lower level base instinct to make us basically a bunch of gibbering mind-numbed idiots so they can control us.
[00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:52.716]  And they're moving aggressively to poison and control us and literally wreck everything that humankind could be.
[00:54:53.756 --> 00:54:55.337]  That's really what the New World Order is.
[00:54:56.438 --> 00:54:59.760]  And I am begging God
[00:55:00.709 --> 00:55:13.599]  To lead the people, to reach into their hearts, and to get them to stand up and take action, and to help us be delivered from this unbelievable evil.
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:26.168]  But no, the psychology of the bought and paid for churches almost unanimously says, lay down, it's the end of the world, you have nothing to do, and you're going to find out, folks, that that's all a fraud.
[00:55:27.631 --> 00:55:36.213]  You're going to find out that you're going to have to go through it just like Christ did, just like the disciples did, just like everybody else in human history, just like the founding fathers had to go through the fire.
[00:55:37.873 --> 00:55:43.715]  It's unbelievable how they just get you to all sit out of the game because they lied to you.
[00:55:44.935 --> 00:55:45.875]  And it works like a charm.
[00:55:46.536 --> 00:55:50.176]  Father Rockefeller a hundred years ago took over the World Council of Churches.
[00:55:50.196 --> 00:55:52.417]  It was the National Council of Churches.
[00:55:54.921 --> 00:55:59.505]  And your preachers sit up there in their big houses and walk around in their dandy little suits and their Cadillacs.
[00:55:59.586 --> 00:56:01.087]  And of course they're all totally unhappy.
[00:56:01.728 --> 00:56:03.169]  But they think it's because they don't have more.
[00:56:03.209 --> 00:56:04.110]  It's always more, more, more.
[00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:05.551]  More, more, more.
[00:56:05.571 --> 00:56:05.671]  So, uh...
[00:56:12.822 --> 00:56:25.947]  Yeah, in the 60's it was, we've got to get involved and fight the tyranny and oppression, and then the government came in with its operatives, these psychiatrists, CIA officers, most of them, posing as rebellion counterculture leaders, saying, no, you've got to look inward.
[00:56:26.527 --> 00:56:38.131]  You've got to just care about yourself, and not just change yourself, just don't care about the world at all, and then you can just be in your own world, your own little matrix, and then everything will be alright.
[00:56:39.269 --> 00:56:40.950]  And of course the complete opposite has happened.
[00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:44.212]  Now that just got you into a lower bestial level.
[00:56:44.232 --> 00:56:47.513]  They told you to get lower and lower into that animal level.
[00:56:47.613 --> 00:56:51.075]  You'd find, you know, somehow some godhood down there at the bottom of it.
[00:56:51.355 --> 00:56:51.855]  And you didn't.
[00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:52.716]  You found a demon.
[00:56:53.296 --> 00:56:54.437]  You found a complete animal.
[00:56:54.937 --> 00:56:56.638]  That's what all the psychological tests showed.
[00:56:56.658 --> 00:57:01.500]  And now we're a bunch of animals that watch television shows where children are tortured and you root for it.
[00:57:03.061 --> 00:57:06.643]  The truth is you are empowered because you are designed
[00:57:07.572 --> 00:57:09.633]  to give and to nurture.
[00:57:10.333 --> 00:57:12.293]  You are designed to serve.
[00:57:13.233 --> 00:57:16.134]  You are designed to risk.
[00:57:16.294 --> 00:57:20.535]  You are designed to trailblaze and strive and explore.
[00:57:21.315 --> 00:57:28.417]  And you are designed to fight, because you're always going to have oppression and danger in the world, so you are designed to resist it.
[00:57:29.082 --> 00:57:35.384]  And that's when you're going to be fulfilled, and that's when you're going to be empowered, and that's when you're going to be scary to the New World Order.
[00:57:35.544 --> 00:57:39.606]  They are scared to death of people that are truly empowered and that are ready to die.
[00:57:40.166 --> 00:57:49.629]  And they are scared to death of people who have tuned into the real life force and the real power of the universe that emanates out of the soul of the Almighty Creator.
[00:57:50.809 --> 00:57:51.089]  Okay?
[00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:52.830]  It's that simple.
[00:57:54.705 --> 00:58:00.389]  And these existentialists and the rest of them tell you that it's all nothingness at the end, and it's all worthless, and it's all a bunch of crap.
[00:58:00.749 --> 00:58:02.910]  They are the biggest liars in the world.
[00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:05.111]  And it comes right out of the Department of Defense.
[00:58:05.832 --> 00:58:07.233]  Right out of the Department of Defense.
[00:58:07.973 --> 00:58:11.895]  And I can't believe I found a four-hour BBC program where they just admit the entire thing.
[00:58:11.956 --> 00:58:13.116]  It's unbelievable.
[00:58:13.356 --> 00:58:19.120]  I mean, they've got cameras inside the government, inside the Pentagon, inside Stanford Research Institute.
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:35.204]  I already knew all this, but to see them show it, and admit it, and to tell you it's rebellion, to tell you it's resistance, it is so right to sacrifice.
[00:58:35.324 --> 00:58:37.465]  It's so good to lay yourself down.
[00:58:37.785 --> 00:58:38.185]  Do it.
[00:58:38.545 --> 00:58:39.706]  Join us.
[00:58:40.926 --> 00:58:45.587]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:51.226 --> 00:58:51.406]  What?
[00:58:57.233 --> 00:58:57.894]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.554 --> 00:58:59.615]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.315 --> 00:59:01.456]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.077 --> 00:59:02.897]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.658 --> 00:59:04.558]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.219 --> 00:59:09.162]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.402 --> 00:59:13.485]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:29.658 --> 00:59:30.418]  Welcome back.
[00:59:30.518 --> 00:59:36.684]  Now already into our number two DV Kid, legendary fighter against the New World Order.
[00:59:36.724 --> 00:59:38.166]  Will be joining us for the first time.
[00:59:38.606 --> 00:59:41.429]  For many years I never knew how to get a hold of her and she's now moved to Texas.
[00:59:41.489 --> 00:59:48.836]  I met her in person out at the fight against the toll roads and the animal ID and the tracking system.
[00:59:50.103 --> 00:59:52.965]  Just a few weeks ago, so she'll be coming on with us.
[00:59:52.985 --> 00:59:54.726]  I'm going to play a clip, too.
[00:59:55.086 --> 00:59:58.209]  All over the country, they're putting in this thing called the Raptor System.
[00:59:59.509 --> 01:00:09.296]  One of my folks that works here has got family that live out in Westlake, and they've got... Yeah, sure, I'll take some coffee next.
[01:00:13.755 --> 01:00:15.056]  You have to have an ID.
[01:00:15.116 --> 01:00:17.116]  You have to scan when you go in to get your kids.
[01:00:17.156 --> 01:00:17.737]  It's a prison.
[01:00:18.097 --> 01:00:20.798]  This is going in under federal funds nationwide to train you.
[01:00:20.818 --> 01:00:27.180]  Of course, meanwhile, statistically, there are more pedophiles on the inside and people that want to abuse children.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:36.864]  That's what they gravitate towards in the schools is to make sure you're locked up with the out-of-control jail guards in the asylum training you about that separation from your family.
[01:00:38.364 --> 01:00:40.605]  We also talked about KSM.
[01:00:41.423 --> 01:00:46.705]  Confessing to things that didn't even exist before he was, and after he was arrested.
[01:00:48.105 --> 01:00:51.767]  KSM has confessed to attacking a bank founded after his arrest.
[01:00:52.507 --> 01:00:55.048]  And the whole, and I'm telling you, the entire media is not buying it.
[01:00:55.428 --> 01:00:56.848]  Except for a few controlled organs.
[01:00:56.929 --> 01:00:58.089]  It's just, no one's buying it.
[01:00:58.149 --> 01:01:01.730]  Major polls, 74 to 80 percent, depending on the poll, aren't buying it.
[01:01:03.791 --> 01:01:05.091]  It's just a complete joke.
[01:01:05.151 --> 01:01:09.413]  Robert Baer, former top CIA analyst, writing for Time Magazine, says it's a complete fraud.
[01:01:11.193 --> 01:01:14.855]  Again, that's all up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:14.895 --> 01:01:15.796]  Really important article.
[01:01:16.176 --> 01:01:18.779]  Paul Joseph Watson put together.
[01:01:18.839 --> 01:01:25.063]  KSM confessed to attacking Bank founded after his arrest.
[01:01:25.083 --> 01:01:28.146]  Get this and get this out to everybody, folks.
[01:01:29.267 --> 01:01:33.090]  It is so vitally important, this particular story is.
[01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:35.892]  Before we go to DV Kidd here in the next segment,
[01:01:38.274 --> 01:01:47.961]  I would like to encourage all of you, the listeners to this show, to... I mean, I say this every couple of hours.
[01:01:47.981 --> 01:01:49.222]  I mean, it's really important.
[01:01:49.242 --> 01:01:50.423]  I don't know if it sinks in.
[01:01:53.725 --> 01:01:54.866]  We need your support.
[01:01:55.126 --> 01:01:56.787]  We can do a lot more with your support.
[01:01:57.968 --> 01:01:59.609]  Our currency here is the Infowar.
[01:01:59.649 --> 01:02:04.993]  That's what we wish to attain, and we're able to further the Infowar and our effectiveness
[01:02:05.777 --> 01:02:18.626]  Through you getting the films and making copies of them and getting them out to people and becoming more informed yourself, and then through that support, it's a feedback loop, we're then able to make even better films and do better websites and put out more material and be more effective in the future.
[01:02:20.167 --> 01:02:21.047]  These are great films.
[01:02:21.167 --> 01:02:22.388]  I mean, you really need these.
[01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:26.711]  These documentaries need to be in your library.
[01:02:26.951 --> 01:02:27.772]  You need to have them.
[01:02:29.028 --> 01:02:42.474]  Iraq for Sale, The War of Profiteers, Aftermath, Unanswered Questions from 9-11, 9-11 Press for Truth, and American Blackout are four new films we just added to the online video and bookstore shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[01:02:43.174 --> 01:02:49.057]  You can get my new film Terror Storm, the history of government-sponsored terror, over three hours with 68 minutes of extras.
[01:02:49.137 --> 01:02:49.877]  Incredible film.
[01:02:50.137 --> 01:02:52.258]  I don't have time to go into all the stuff it covers.
[01:02:52.967 --> 01:02:54.088]  It just gets into all of it.
[01:02:54.108 --> 01:03:01.013]  The history of terror, 9-11, 7-7, the torture news, the fake news, the billions in fake news, the fake reporters.
[01:03:02.274 --> 01:03:03.635]  It's really an important film.
[01:03:04.696 --> 01:03:06.137]  The idiocy of the neocons.
[01:03:06.798 --> 01:03:07.739]  The Liberals as well.
[01:03:07.799 --> 01:03:08.901]  It's all exposed.
[01:03:09.021 --> 01:03:10.583]  It's my best film today.
[01:03:11.083 --> 01:03:11.744]  Terror Storm.
[01:03:11.764 --> 01:03:12.025]  Get it.
[01:03:12.045 --> 01:03:15.349]  1-888-253-3139 is the toll free number to call as well.
[01:03:15.369 --> 01:03:16.370]  Again, that's InfoWars.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[01:03:24.159 --> 01:03:26.681]  And that's how you support us, is by getting the books, the videos.
[01:03:26.701 --> 01:03:32.885]  You can also write to us at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:03:33.645 --> 01:03:39.809]  And be sure to visit the site at least monthly and peruse the Secure Safe Shopping Cart.
[01:03:40.369 --> 01:03:42.130]  And look at some of the items there and get some.
[01:03:42.991 --> 01:03:44.752]  Don't forget prisonplanet.tv as well.
[01:03:44.792 --> 01:03:45.953]  See it all online right now.
[01:03:45.993 --> 01:03:47.494]  We'll be right back with D.V.
[01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:49.535]  Kidd right here on GCN.
[01:03:56.028 --> 01:04:01.474]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:01.854 --> 01:04:09.462]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.177 --> 01:04:17.221]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:29.047]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.367 --> 01:04:33.310]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:35.271]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.591 --> 01:04:39.453]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:04:40.033 --> 01:04:47.481]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:04:52.546 --> 01:04:57.828]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:04:58.048 --> 01:05:00.129]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:07.471]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:05:07.611 --> 01:05:19.115]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.

[01:05:48.007 --> 01:05:49.028]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:53.126 --> 01:05:55.468]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:05:55.728 --> 01:05:57.749]  When was the last time you used pure soap?

[01:06:58.626 --> 01:06:59.707]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.387 --> 01:07:01.648]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.168 --> 01:07:02.989]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.729 --> 01:07:04.769]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:08.911]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.472 --> 01:07:13.634]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:13.814 --> 01:07:17.095]  Now into hour number two.
[01:07:25.945 --> 01:07:27.566]  And I tell you, it's really great to have D.B.
[01:07:27.626 --> 01:07:28.886]  Kidd with us today.
[01:07:29.907 --> 01:07:37.350]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I want to play a clip because we're going to be talking about RFID, the tracker chips, the Trans-Texas Corridor, the North American Union.
[01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:48.154]  I want to play a clip of this Raptor system where the schools are prisons and the parents have to be scanned in and their IDs run just to get into the school, period.
[01:07:48.174 --> 01:07:50.775]  And we're going to break down what's really behind that.
[01:07:51.575 --> 01:07:53.636]  But good news, Texas House of Representatives
[01:07:54.881 --> 01:07:57.662]  Defies the governor of a mandatory Gardasil vaccine.
[01:07:58.182 --> 01:08:12.108]  The Texas House of Representatives voted 118-23 on March 14th, just a couple days ago, in favor of a bill that would remove the Gardasil human papillomavirus from the list of shots required for school attendance.
[01:08:12.788 --> 01:08:14.049]  But see, that's a fraud too.
[01:08:14.629 --> 01:08:18.791]  It's only the recommended vaccines, then the schools lie and say it's the law.
[01:08:19.503 --> 01:08:20.883]  It's nothing but a regulation.
[01:08:21.103 --> 01:08:22.004]  There's no law.
[01:08:22.024 --> 01:08:23.524]  That's why they have to, quote, give you a waiver.
[01:08:23.804 --> 01:08:28.845]  That itself is meant to acclimate you and train you to give it the illusion of law.
[01:08:29.285 --> 01:08:30.506]  It's all color of law.
[01:08:30.886 --> 01:08:31.906]  It's all agreement.
[01:08:32.366 --> 01:08:33.806]  It's all contract agreement.
[01:08:34.206 --> 01:08:37.167]  Like when you sign your kid up, they're having you sign contracts.
[01:08:39.308 --> 01:08:39.988]  It's unbelievable.
[01:08:40.008 --> 01:08:40.968]  Let's go to DV Kid.
[01:08:41.008 --> 01:08:43.108]  DV, it is a real honor to have you on with us.
[01:08:43.689 --> 01:08:45.329]  Well, it's nice to talk to you again.
[01:08:46.050 --> 01:08:47.391]  It was great to meet you in person.
[01:08:47.451 --> 01:08:57.555]  For those that don't know who you are, you've been hiding under a rock, just kind of give us a thumbnail sketch about DV Kid, how you woke up, some of the big projects you've done, some of the victories you've had, and what you're working on right now.
[01:08:58.476 --> 01:09:11.862]  I'm just like millions of other Americans who one day had something brought to their attention, and in my case, 17 years ago, it was a book about the Federal Reserve, and I just happened to be at the big book signing from one of my books down in LA.
[01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:16.292]  And I read this about the Federal Reserve and I said, well, that can't be right.
[01:09:16.312 --> 01:09:24.236]  So when I got back to Denver, I went down to the Federal Reserve and I got their materials and made a few phone calls to friends that I knew were politically active.
[01:09:24.276 --> 01:09:41.464]  And the next thing I know, um, here I am 17 years later and some regards wish I didn't know what I know, but of course I'm one of those people who would rather know, but it's been a long 17 years of learning and unlearning and, you know,
[01:09:42.364 --> 01:09:48.946]  It's coming to the realization that I've been lied to my entire life by every politician who's been in office.
[01:09:49.606 --> 01:09:55.468]  And, you know, as we sit here today, Alex, America is dying by a thousand cuts every single day.
[01:09:55.868 --> 01:09:58.069]  We are in such serious trouble.
[01:09:58.609 --> 01:10:04.411]  And the plan by, I call them the masters of the game, has been diabolically brilliant.
[01:10:05.151 --> 01:10:08.873]  And, you know, my new column that went up, what's today, Friday?
[01:10:08.893 --> 01:10:09.593]  Yeah, it went up today.
[01:10:10.274 --> 01:10:16.116]  On the vaccine here in the state of Texas and I was at the rally and that's where I was able to finally meet you.
[01:10:17.256 --> 01:10:18.136]  It is putrid.
[01:10:18.196 --> 01:10:21.157]  I never had to go through this garbage when my daughter was growing up.
[01:10:21.737 --> 01:10:25.798]  I had her get polio, diphtheria, and smallpox and that was it.
[01:10:25.818 --> 01:10:27.278]  Nobody ever said another word.
[01:10:28.159 --> 01:10:37.101]  But I feel sorry for parents today that have small children and what they're being forced to go through to get their children, well I don't say educated,
[01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:42.838]  But unless there's a huge backlash by the parents in this country, it's only going to get worse.
[01:10:42.858 --> 01:10:44.319]  And I'll tell you where this all started.
[01:10:44.439 --> 01:10:48.583]  It started with a group, I call them hens, called Women in Government.
[01:10:49.003 --> 01:10:57.491]  It's one of the most evil organizations in this country, and it's made up of all of these featherheads that managed to get themselves elected to public office.
[01:10:57.938 --> 01:11:02.919]  And they think up all this nanny mother government garbage for the children.
[01:11:03.219 --> 01:11:11.921]  And that's where all of these vaccines and all this crazy garbage is coming from, is from these stupid airhead women serving in public office.
[01:11:12.161 --> 01:11:17.062]  Who are used as front groups to give it the look of a local grassroots campaign.
[01:11:17.102 --> 01:11:18.002]  They call it Rent-A-Mob.
[01:11:18.422 --> 01:11:21.503]  But let's go back to the Federal Reserve and talk about the successes you've had.
[01:11:23.583 --> 01:11:24.223]  Just one example.
[01:11:24.243 --> 01:11:26.384]  I interviewed Joe Bannister back in
[01:11:27.583 --> 01:11:32.685]  I guess it was 1999, first video interview he did, weeks after he went public.
[01:11:33.305 --> 01:11:38.368]  But two years before that, he was listening in the Bay Area, there in Oakland, to D.V.
[01:11:38.408 --> 01:11:47.352]  Kidd on one of the biggest talk shows in California, and he heard her calmly going over the facts, the Federal Reserve being private, the income tax being voluntary.
[01:11:47.832 --> 01:11:49.833]  He thought, this is nuts, but he respected the host.
[01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:50.953]  He said, I'll go research it.
[01:11:51.313 --> 01:11:53.494]  Two years later, he found it was all true.
[01:11:54.555 --> 01:11:55.275]  He went public.
[01:11:55.945 --> 01:12:02.295]  They tried to indict him, they took him to trial, the jury found him not guilty, and a huge victory there.
[01:12:02.655 --> 01:12:06.982]  That's an example of how she planted seeds, people checked into it, just like
[01:12:08.143 --> 01:12:16.488]  You know, decades ago, she's at a book fair, hears something, she doesn't believe it, she goes and checks it out, she finds it.
[01:12:16.508 --> 01:12:24.753]  I mean, when I tell you they're grabbing little kids in New York and giving them drug trials and pesticides until they die, I mean, that really is happening.
[01:12:24.793 --> 01:12:29.396]  I want you to go, not just say, oh yeah, right, I want you to go find out the government's murdering little kids.
[01:12:29.896 --> 01:12:33.037]  I want you to find out Dinecore and Halliburton run giant child kidnapping rings.
[01:12:33.397 --> 01:12:37.178]  I want you to find out this is real, folks, because I'm risking my life, D.B.
[01:12:37.218 --> 01:12:41.600]  Kidd's risking her life to tell you this, and listen, this is true, but don't you believe me.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:42.480]  You go check it out.
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.841]  I want you to find out it's true, and then to decide.
[01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:47.802]  Are you just going to sit around while this is going on?
[01:12:48.102 --> 01:12:55.224]  Now, D.B., talk about some of your successes, because you've had a huge effect, and then tell us about some of the websites you write for.
[01:12:55.444 --> 01:13:23.921]  Yeah, after I found out about, after I did about a year's worth of research and I stumbled upon people like Eustace Mullins and Bill Benson and people I'd never heard of and so I did all of this research and I sat down, well I actually laid in bed at night after Bill Clinton was allegedly elected the first time and I tried, I said there has to be some way to get this information out so I wrote my Bankrupt America booklet in my head sat down the next day put it into a word processor
[01:13:24.724 --> 01:13:28.887]  The Lord provided me with a donor out of the clear blue.
[01:13:28.907 --> 01:13:30.408]  This is the honest to God truth.
[01:13:30.468 --> 01:13:32.449]  I put out a letter to some friends.
[01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:34.251]  I don't know, about a hundred people I knew.
[01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:36.913]  And I said, you know, I wrote this little booklet.
[01:13:36.973 --> 01:13:41.736]  It's perfect on the Federal Reserve, but I need some money to get the first 5,000 printed.
[01:13:41.856 --> 01:13:47.580]  And the very next day I got a phone call from a caretaker of a man who lived in Grand Junction, Colorado.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:51.763]  I lived in Lakewood at the time, which is a suburb of Denver, because my husband's retired army colonel.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:14:00.624]  This man came down the next day at the five-hour drive with a box full of gold coins that totaled $40,000.
[01:14:02.005 --> 01:14:06.147]  And I traded them for all of the printing for the next few years with my printer.
[01:14:06.827 --> 01:14:10.029]  But the first 5,000 booklets were gone in a heartbeat.
[01:14:10.569 --> 01:14:13.411]  And at the same time, I had all of my volunteers.
[01:14:13.471 --> 01:14:14.411]  I called all these people.
[01:14:14.451 --> 01:14:14.932]  We went down.
[01:14:14.952 --> 01:14:18.353]  We picketed the Federal Reserve from January to September of 1993.
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:27.146]  Gathered almost two million signatures, took them to Washington D.C., had a big rally, about 5,000 people, September 29, 1993.
[01:14:27.886 --> 01:14:37.954]  Then, of course, as time goes by, you know, the booklets are going, you know, people are getting them and getting them and getting them out, and Joe Bannister... And that was Billions to the Bankers, right?
[01:14:38.335 --> 01:14:39.916]  No, it's Why a Bankrupt America.
[01:14:40.837 --> 01:14:41.557]  That was the title.
[01:14:41.878 --> 01:14:44.320]  Okay, I always, but somewhere it says Billions for the Bankers.
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:46.141]  I just get that in my head from seeing it on the front.
[01:14:46.521 --> 01:14:48.483]  And Joe Bannister was
[01:14:49.259 --> 01:14:53.220]  You know, he's become a dear friend and it was one of those things I'll never forget.
[01:14:53.260 --> 01:15:00.142]  I picked up the phone one day and this guy said, Hi, my name's Joe Bannister and I'm a criminal investigator for the IRS.
[01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:02.662]  And I said, OK, well, what can I do for you?
[01:15:03.643 --> 01:15:08.504]  So then he told me, you know, that he had ordered my booklets and read them and he wanted to talk to me.
[01:15:08.544 --> 01:15:10.764]  So we set up a meeting in San Jose, California.
[01:15:10.784 --> 01:15:12.905]  I drove three hours to meet him and his attorney.
[01:15:13.645 --> 01:15:16.506]  And I said, do you have some kind of proof of who you are?
[01:15:16.526 --> 01:15:18.006]  Because I didn't know him from Adam.
[01:15:18.655 --> 01:15:24.879]  So, right there in the pizza parlor, he takes his gun out and he puts it on the table, along with his badge.
[01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:27.781]  It was very funny, actually.
[01:15:28.141 --> 01:15:32.944]  But he is just one of the nicest, most sincere, genuine people you've ever met in your life.
[01:15:32.984 --> 01:15:37.727]  I was at his trial there in Sacramento, because my husband and I lived there at the time.
[01:15:37.747 --> 01:15:38.807]  Yeah, tell folks about that.
[01:15:38.847 --> 01:15:44.991]  I mean, that's how criminal this government is, is he goes public about this and they cook up charges on him, and then he's found not guilty.
[01:15:45.805 --> 01:15:56.969]  Well, one thing I always try to, you know, encourage people to do, especially retirees, get down to these courthouses and attend these trials and see how very serious this is.
[01:15:57.409 --> 01:16:13.114]  You know, the courtroom was packed every single day for Joseph's trial, and the jury selection, and the whole, this is as serious as it gets, and it, you know, he had the best legal minds you could have, Jeff Dickstein and Bob Bernhardt, and Bernhoff.
[01:16:13.542 --> 01:16:32.954]  Watching the jury, it's hard when you're sitting there watching these people because the very jurors that I thought were going to vote against them came out after the acquittal and said that they were mad that the government even brought charges against Joe because they said there was no case and the government knew it.
[01:16:33.334 --> 01:16:35.536]  That they felt that this was nothing but harassment.
[01:16:35.676 --> 01:16:39.399]  And they just claimed he was a criminal for going around telling people it was a fraud.
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:40.300]  Oh, sure.
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:41.361]  I mean, how is that?
[01:16:41.441 --> 01:16:45.665]  Again, folks, they're trying to ban free speech because they can't win against us.
[01:16:46.065 --> 01:16:48.027]  Even though they've got all the money, we've got the truth.
[01:16:48.327 --> 01:16:53.672]  And they play so dirty because right now he's about to lose his CPA license.
[01:16:53.712 --> 01:16:54.913]  The state of California
[01:16:55.453 --> 01:17:08.626]  Working in bed with the horrors of the federal government, now the state is within a breath of taking away his CPA license, the very tool that he uses to feed his wife and his two boys.
[01:17:10.248 --> 01:17:14.311]  These people are just so rampant and so toxic and so putrid.
[01:17:14.772 --> 01:17:17.795]  I don't know how they look themselves in the mirror every day.
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.742]  Knowing what they do for their paycheck.
[01:17:21.042 --> 01:17:23.784]  They literally whore their convictions away.
[01:17:24.185 --> 01:17:27.707]  They're a bunch of self-centered trash.
[01:17:28.208 --> 01:17:30.890]  Yeah, well, those are the polite words we can use.
[01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:34.093]  But I've known Joseph since 1999.
[01:17:35.253 --> 01:17:37.015]  He has a wonderful family.
[01:17:37.195 --> 01:17:38.896]  One of his brothers is a police officer.
[01:17:38.996 --> 01:17:40.458]  One is a firefighter.
[01:17:40.758 --> 01:17:43.740]  And believe me, they were all there in support of Joe.
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:46.602]  And these two putrid U.S.
[01:17:46.682 --> 01:17:47.203]  attorneys
[01:17:48.155 --> 01:17:49.656]  Oh, they just, ugh.
[01:17:50.016 --> 01:17:54.237]  And then they put these special agents, you know, Treasury agents up on the stand.
[01:17:54.757 --> 01:18:04.080]  Joe used to be one of their own, one of their valued employees, you know, one of their, you know, ones that they decorate and promote and everything.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.461]  And they treated him like he was dirt.
[01:18:06.921 --> 01:18:13.603]  Simply because he's a man of moral conviction and he threw away an $80,000 a year paycheck.
[01:18:13.643 --> 01:18:16.765]  Look, he found out that private banks hijacked the country.
[01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:18.585]  It's an absolute documented fact.
[01:18:18.865 --> 01:18:20.006]  And then we're totally owned.
[01:18:20.426 --> 01:18:21.326]  I mean, it's real simple.
[01:18:21.686 --> 01:18:25.028]  And this is the way that I have found... Oh, we've got to go to a break.
[01:18:25.168 --> 01:18:25.848]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:18:26.348 --> 01:18:30.370]  And then let's get into Trans-Texas Corridor, North American Union, what you thought of the rally.
[01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:33.311]  Talk about some of your books and stuff you're putting out.
[01:18:33.351 --> 01:18:34.191]  Great materials.
[01:18:34.831 --> 01:18:35.271]  D.B.
[01:18:35.291 --> 01:18:36.852]  Kidd, great to have her on.
[01:18:36.872 --> 01:18:38.353]  We'll be having her on a routine basis.
[01:18:38.393 --> 01:18:40.274]  And she's now a fellow Texan.
[01:18:40.334 --> 01:18:43.616]  She's evacuated California, now gone beneath the waves.
[01:18:44.176 --> 01:18:46.518]  And she's evacuated to the Republic of Texas.
[01:18:46.538 --> 01:18:47.118]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.602 --> 01:18:54.003]  Attention!
[01:18:54.123 --> 01:18:56.945]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[01:18:57.226 --> 01:19:01.530]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:02.551]  Listen closely.
[01:19:03.191 --> 01:19:10.658]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[01:19:10.959 --> 01:19:17.425]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity,
[01:19:17.585 --> 01:19:17.885]  I think so.
[01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:41.096]  If you're a customer, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[01:19:41.296 --> 01:19:44.882]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[01:19:45.102 --> 01:19:48.448]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:19:53.041 --> 01:19:54.022]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:19:54.102 --> 01:19:58.866]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:19:59.046 --> 01:20:06.853]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:20:07.113 --> 01:20:12.498]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:20:12.698 --> 01:20:19.684]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:20:19.964 --> 01:20:25.308]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:20:25.568 --> 01:20:30.291]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:20:30.631 --> 01:20:38.216]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:20:38.576 --> 01:20:44.819]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:20:45.119 --> 01:20:46.279]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:46.299 --> 01:20:46.560]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.595 --> 01:20:57.819]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:20:57.959 --> 01:21:06.065]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:21:06.305 --> 01:21:13.370]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:21:14.311 --> 01:21:20.795]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:21:20.995 --> 01:21:26.079]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:21:26.199 --> 01:21:35.065]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:21:35.345 --> 01:21:38.628]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:41.070]  We're good.
[01:21:52.924 --> 01:21:55.346]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:21:55.846 --> 01:21:59.168]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:21:59.528 --> 01:22:02.470]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:09.134]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:22:09.214 --> 01:22:13.617]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:22:13.837 --> 01:22:18.220]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.981]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:22:21.001 --> 01:22:23.763]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:22:24.223 --> 01:22:26.765]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:22:26.805 --> 01:22:31.067]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:22:31.127 --> 01:22:31.968]  Treasury bonds.
[01:22:32.248 --> 01:22:36.874]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[01:22:37.054 --> 01:22:38.696]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:22:38.716 --> 01:22:40.278]  That's 1-8888-XANADU or 1-8888-XANADU and ask for George.
[01:23:01.951 --> 01:23:12.755]  Governments elites through history, the Byzantines, the Romans, they glorify the Greeks.
[01:23:13.295 --> 01:23:15.896]  This new movie, 300, is total propaganda.
[01:23:16.676 --> 01:23:27.799]  It's actually the Spartans kept the Hellenes as their slaves and they had their young men do ritual sacrifices of the Hellenes, who were their slaves.
[01:23:28.059 --> 01:23:30.180]  The Spartans were the scum of Greece.
[01:23:31.690 --> 01:23:38.231]  But oh no, not by the time the mainstream media and the culture is done with it.
[01:23:38.371 --> 01:23:45.573]  In this new film, I was reading a synopsis, it is the... I just wanted to make this point.
[01:23:46.093 --> 01:23:50.714]  It is the Persians that are all homosexuals and the Spartans are against it.
[01:23:51.714 --> 01:23:53.714]  It's the complete opposite of reality.
[01:23:53.934 --> 01:23:57.555]  My point is, government's bad, government's dangerous, it does bad things,
[01:23:58.619 --> 01:24:01.742]  And things are just getting more and more serious.
[01:24:02.142 --> 01:24:02.502]  D.V.
[01:24:02.542 --> 01:24:05.865]  Kidd, what are we going to do about government and the private corporations that own and run it?
[01:24:06.545 --> 01:24:09.587]  Well, the American people have to withdraw their support.
[01:24:09.748 --> 01:24:10.668]  That's number one.
[01:24:10.748 --> 01:24:18.314]  And I've been on this issue since 1994, when NAFTA was unconstitutionally ratified by a counterfeit Senate.
[01:24:18.814 --> 01:24:27.721]  The American people have the ability to use their financial resources to at least, you know, slow down the process.
[01:24:28.177 --> 01:24:33.520]  These big multinational corporations that have dumped on the American worker don't deserve your support.
[01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:38.702]  And on my website dv.com I have a whole section on Made in America.
[01:24:39.042 --> 01:24:50.548]  And the more we buy from these companies that manufacture thousands, I mean thousands of products, the more American workers they will hire and expand.
[01:24:50.988 --> 01:24:54.470]  And some of these companies I know that went south of the border
[01:24:55.434 --> 01:25:08.077]  And even the big banking houses now have pulled back some of their outsourcing to countries like the Philippines because people like me will not speak to these 800 operators in New Delhi.
[01:25:08.677 --> 01:25:16.118]  So, you know, I could... Actually, and I don't watch commercials on the boob tube, but I did catch just one last night.
[01:25:16.599 --> 01:25:23.560]  It was something called the Walk-In Pub and very prominently featured in this TV commercial on Fox News.
[01:25:24.048 --> 01:25:35.833]  Well, there are websites, too, that tell you where there's stuff made in America, but what we couldn't find was coffee cups made in America.
[01:25:35.873 --> 01:25:43.457]  For about two years, I wanted to have Infowars coffee cups, and we just can't sell them because I can't find it made in America.
[01:25:44.190 --> 01:25:52.397]  And then a few times we've had American distributors that we had making t-shirts go out of business and then for a few months we've got to have made in Honduras because we were having trouble finding them.
[01:25:52.837 --> 01:26:03.426]  I mean it's just... It's hard because I had t-shirts say no to democracy and I used a wonderful organization up in Pennsylvania.
[01:26:03.606 --> 01:26:05.367]  They're 100% made in the United States.
[01:26:05.788 --> 01:26:08.290]  There's another company called Athletic Apparel.
[01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:10.992]  We just listed them and I bought a bunch of t-shirts from them.
[01:26:11.502 --> 01:26:13.384]  Yeah, they're out of Pennsylvania also.
[01:26:13.724 --> 01:26:20.830]  One hundred percent, all of the fabric, all of the assembly, everything is done in the United States by American workers.
[01:26:20.890 --> 01:26:23.712]  So, that's one of the things that the American people can do.
[01:26:23.772 --> 01:26:34.040]  The second thing they can do is if you own stock in these companies that are selling out the United States or are profiting from the slaughter... Dump the stock!
[01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:34.921]  Dump the stock!
[01:26:34.941 --> 01:26:36.883]  Get your money out and then bad mouth it!
[01:26:37.283 --> 01:26:38.184]  Yes, get out!
[01:26:38.604 --> 01:26:41.006]  Like I said in my column today about Merck.
[01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:44.813]  You know, if you own stock in this company, it's time to make your voice heard.
[01:26:44.833 --> 01:26:48.736]  And by the way, a lot of you own mutual funds and you don't even really know what you have.
[01:26:49.256 --> 01:26:50.017]  Go to the trouble.
[01:26:50.417 --> 01:26:51.278]  You know, dump it.
[01:26:52.099 --> 01:26:53.300]  Don't be greedy.
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.422]  I mean, I guarantee you, if I owned any of these stocks, I'd dump them.
[01:26:56.682 --> 01:27:02.047]  Why do you keep... I just ask Americans, especially when I make speeches, why do you keep funding your enemy?
[01:27:02.787 --> 01:27:08.172]  You know, you're going to end up... you're actually funding your own destruction.
[01:27:08.917 --> 01:27:21.483]  And if money means that much to you, then find a way to invest it in a company or an organization that is honorable and does the right thing, and not a company like Merck or Monsanto.
[01:27:21.883 --> 01:27:23.444]  These companies are evil.
[01:27:23.944 --> 01:27:34.109]  And that's not to say that there aren't pharmaceutical products out there that are very beneficial, but what Merck is doing with this Gardasil is purely evil.
[01:27:34.693 --> 01:27:37.575]  So quit, you know, quit funding your enemy out there.
[01:27:38.135 --> 01:27:40.156]  And of course, the other thing is activism.
[01:27:40.896 --> 01:27:49.741]  When I was standing in front of the Capitol on March 2nd, and I heard you before I ever saw you, and I thought, boy, that sounds just like Alex Jones.
[01:27:49.801 --> 01:28:00.247]  I looked down the street, and I saw the cops and all the flags, and I finally was able to see you long distance, you know, with the bullhorn, and I thought, this is just like, you know, Moses parting the Red Sea.
[01:28:00.307 --> 01:28:00.867]  Here he comes.
[01:28:00.947 --> 01:28:01.608]  It was great!
[01:28:01.688 --> 01:28:03.549]  I had such a wonderful time!
[01:28:04.345 --> 01:28:07.187]  Yeah, I've been to so many of these in the last 17 years.
[01:28:07.688 --> 01:28:10.110]  Alex, so many of them are terribly disappointing.
[01:28:10.490 --> 01:28:12.852]  I drove from Sacramento down to L.A.
[01:28:13.232 --> 01:28:22.219]  last March of 2006 for a contrail rally, and 20 people, 20 maybe 30 people showed up all day.
[01:28:22.479 --> 01:28:28.323]  But just a few days later, half a million illegals were standing right where we were.
[01:28:28.343 --> 01:28:30.585]  It was very sad.
[01:28:33.034 --> 01:28:38.999]  But even if it was just one person out there, you know, it's still on the right, so that's what counts.
[01:28:39.099 --> 01:28:39.779]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.442 --> 01:28:44.343]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.823 --> 01:28:46.444]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.345 --> 01:28:50.027]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.491 --> 01:28:59.998]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[01:29:00.218 --> 01:29:04.262]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[01:29:04.502 --> 01:29:06.664]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[01:29:07.025 --> 01:29:13.992]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[01:29:14.352 --> 01:29:16.953]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[01:29:17.213 --> 01:29:20.733]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[01:29:20.993 --> 01:29:28.895]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:29:29.275 --> 01:29:30.756]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[01:29:31.036 --> 01:29:36.817]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid.
[01:29:37.157 --> 01:29:37.518]  Thank you.
[01:29:52.856 --> 01:29:57.801]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:29:58.121 --> 01:30:00.003]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[01:30:00.183 --> 01:30:03.246]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:30:03.426 --> 01:30:06.569]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:30:06.869 --> 01:30:08.711]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:30:08.971 --> 01:30:12.673]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[01:30:12.953 --> 01:30:15.614]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible!
[01:30:15.634 --> 01:30:20.557]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[01:30:20.737 --> 01:30:24.979]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[01:30:25.419 --> 01:30:29.761]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[01:30:30.061 --> 01:30:34.323]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[01:30:34.643 --> 01:30:40.526]  You will receive information regarding America in prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[01:30:40.826 --> 01:30:43.267]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[01:30:43.467 --> 01:30:43.967]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:30:43.987 --> 01:30:45.088]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[01:30:53.283 --> 01:30:54.163]  It's no secret.
[01:30:54.424 --> 01:30:59.906]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[01:31:00.086 --> 01:31:04.848]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[01:31:05.188 --> 01:31:07.489]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:10.270]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called No-BO.
[01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:18.673]  No-BO eliminates the bacterial growth which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[01:31:18.853 --> 01:31:22.995]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in No-BO.
[01:31:23.135 --> 01:31:23.275]  No-BO.
[01:31:23.375 --> 01:31:29.597]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil, arrowroot powder, silica, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and geranium.
[01:31:29.777 --> 01:31:33.918]  No-BO's job is to destroy the bacteria that causes the odor while soothing your skin.
[01:31:34.098 --> 01:31:38.440]  You can use No-BO under your arms, on tough foot odors, or for athlete's foot.
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:42.581]  No-BO is guaranteed 100% or receive a full refund.
[01:31:42.941 --> 01:31:45.482]  Visit No-BO.com to order.
[01:31:45.602 --> 01:31:48.423]  That's No-BO.com or call 850-723-8599.
[01:31:56.656 --> 01:32:03.399]  Day after day, alone on a hill.
[01:32:03.439 --> 01:32:09.441]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[01:32:09.521 --> 01:32:14.763]  But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just
[01:32:30.261 --> 01:32:36.402]  Life is not about being a self-centered little greedy government bureaucrat or some propagandist.
[01:32:37.462 --> 01:32:43.383]  It's about reaching out to others, having love, having adversity, building things, having integrity,
[01:32:44.333 --> 01:32:50.196]  And by standing up for others and by laying down your life, if need be, for others, you are truly empowered.
[01:32:50.596 --> 01:32:52.057]  That actually helps you.
[01:32:52.097 --> 01:33:01.261]  And when you live in a society where people care about each other, you have dynamic, exciting, fun-filled, incredible societies.
[01:33:01.741 --> 01:33:06.723]  When you have what we have today, you have everything in crisis and unraveling and falling apart.
[01:33:08.815 --> 01:33:17.977]  And the existentialists, the propagandists, you know, they basically hijacked the whole liberal movement in the 60s with CIA technicians.
[01:33:18.037 --> 01:33:18.697]  It's all admitted.
[01:33:19.697 --> 01:33:21.137]  It's even in a BBC documentary.
[01:33:21.877 --> 01:33:22.838]  I couldn't believe they admitted it.
[01:33:22.858 --> 01:33:24.318]  I mean, I already knew it, but there it was admitted.
[01:33:24.578 --> 01:33:27.558]  And they took total control of it and said, oh, be self-centered.
[01:33:28.118 --> 01:33:31.259]  And now that's really do as thou wilt, Aleister Crowley bull.
[01:33:32.659 --> 01:33:36.660]  And of course, the Aleister Crowleys of the world end up being totally unhappy people.
[01:33:38.177 --> 01:33:42.139]  The Coming Battle by Paul Walter and Lorraine Walter.
[01:33:42.179 --> 01:33:43.380]  Well, it was forwarded by them.
[01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:46.882]  It was written back in 1898, getting into the Federal Reserve, how they planned to take over.
[01:33:46.902 --> 01:33:51.084]  You need to get this book from our online video and bookstore at Infowars.com.
[01:33:51.464 --> 01:33:55.346]  The Terror Conspiracy by Jim Mars, Deception, 9-11, and the Loss of Liberty.
[01:33:55.646 --> 01:34:00.269]  Really an excellent 9-11 book we're carrying there at a high discount on the bookstore.
[01:34:01.229 --> 01:34:01.929]  Powder Burns.
[01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:03.370]  That is out of print.
[01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:05.971]  We have a couple hundred of these left and it's gone.
[01:34:06.071 --> 01:34:08.212]  Cocaine, Contras, and the Drug War.
[01:34:08.292 --> 01:34:08.993]  Powder Burns.
[01:34:09.013 --> 01:34:11.214]  I bought a whole bunch of these a few years ago.
[01:34:11.234 --> 01:34:12.314]  There's just a couple hundred left.
[01:34:12.814 --> 01:34:14.795]  And this is Celica Stillo III.
[01:34:14.875 --> 01:34:18.437]  Amazing book by a top level DEA agent who saw government drug dealing.
[01:34:19.957 --> 01:34:23.399]  Mind Control, A Brave New World, or Enhancing Human Performance.
[01:34:23.439 --> 01:34:25.060]  This is by Dr. Nick Begich.
[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:26.460]  Amazing film.
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:27.701]  And there's an accompanying book
[01:34:28.425 --> 01:34:33.687]  Controlling the Human Mind, the Technologies of Political Control, or Tools for Peak Performance.
[01:34:34.427 --> 01:34:37.809]  And then of course there's The Medusafile by Colonel Craig Roberts.
[01:34:38.309 --> 01:34:41.050]  Good friend of mine and just amazing author.
[01:34:42.330 --> 01:34:46.192]  We carry his book, The Medusafile.
[01:34:47.072 --> 01:34:50.413]  Right now, I just want to remind you that I've made 15 films.
[01:34:50.453 --> 01:34:51.914]  They're available at Infowars.com.
[01:34:53.078 --> 01:34:57.022]  Or you can call toll free to get them 1-888-253-3139.

[01:34:59.724 --> 01:35:04.629]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:35:04.829 --> 01:35:08.592]  And don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:09.393 --> 01:35:18.862]  All 15 of my films, hundreds of weekly TV reports, in-studio video reports, special reports, my book, Paul Watson's book is now out of print,
[01:35:19.548 --> 01:35:20.388]  It's all available.
[01:35:20.448 --> 01:35:24.509]  Print off copies, put them on disc, make copies of the films to disc, and super high quality.
[01:35:24.729 --> 01:35:27.450]  It's a great activist tool, a factory of resistance.
[01:35:27.970 --> 01:35:29.070]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:29.591 --> 01:35:30.291]  Going back to D.B.
[01:35:30.331 --> 01:35:30.551]  Kidd.
[01:35:30.571 --> 01:35:35.352]  D.B., I want to get into tracking and tracing and control and the overall grid and where you see things going.
[01:35:35.752 --> 01:35:39.933]  But before we do that, tell folks about some of the things you put out, some of the websites you write for.
[01:35:40.513 --> 01:35:42.934]  I write for News With Views now.
[01:35:43.014 --> 01:35:47.255]  I used to write for both WorldNetDaily and News With Views, but I have too many things
[01:35:47.859 --> 01:35:50.461]  I just couldn't keep up, so I write for News of Views.
[01:35:51.641 --> 01:36:06.890]  My two booklets, I retired them after putting out two million of them because my printer finally retired, so I retired my booklets and basically write and do radio shows and try to get people to understand the bigger picture, you know, i.e.
[01:36:07.010 --> 01:36:13.714]  one example is, why do you think that the people have been pushed off the land and into these big, huge inner cities
[01:36:14.198 --> 01:36:18.382]  They cannot support this kind of... They don't have the infrastructure to support the population.
[01:36:18.723 --> 01:36:19.944]  Well, the answer is very simple.
[01:36:20.264 --> 01:36:21.766]  You run the people off the land.
[01:36:22.066 --> 01:36:31.476]  You destroy the agricultural, manufacturing, and industrial, which are the three top job sectors that made this country wealthy and self-sufficient.
[01:36:31.877 --> 01:36:51.936]  You stick them and run them into areas like Los Angeles and San Francisco and Dallas and Austin and these big huge cities and then you control all of the flow of information by buying up and owning all the mainstream and now cable media so that they only get what the bad guys want them to get
[01:36:52.589 --> 01:37:00.253]  And then you keep them busy working two to three jobs trying to keep their head above water because you're crushing them in these progressive heavy taxation.
[01:37:00.714 --> 01:37:05.296]  Yeah, there's not enough jobs, there's high taxes in the city, and it's more expensive than real estate.
[01:37:05.736 --> 01:37:13.701]  More expensive, and of course, you know, then you brainwash the children in these, I call them government indoctrination centers.
[01:37:14.001 --> 01:37:15.802]  They're not really schools anymore.
[01:37:16.162 --> 01:37:18.224]  They're centers for indoctrinating your children.
[01:37:18.264 --> 01:37:19.904]  And by the way, you're not just saying that.
[01:37:19.944 --> 01:37:20.585]  They really are.
[01:37:21.005 --> 01:37:22.606]  That's exactly what they are.
[01:37:23.006 --> 01:37:28.749]  And the sad thing is, parents scream and yell about, oh, there's not enough money for education.
[01:37:29.029 --> 01:37:30.510]  That is such BS.
[01:37:30.971 --> 01:37:33.532]  If these parents, and I know that they're tired.
[01:37:34.031 --> 01:37:37.272]  You know, when you live in these big, huge inner cities, you live in Austin.
[01:37:37.672 --> 01:37:41.373]  The traffic alone is enough to make anybody tired.
[01:37:41.413 --> 01:37:47.235]  You've got parents getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning, trying to get the kids off to daycare, to school, throw them to training.
[01:37:47.295 --> 01:37:51.796]  And they've got to have the signets and the baubles, the goodies, to communicate with each other.
[01:37:52.436 --> 01:37:53.717]  Or their neighbors will think nothing.
[01:37:53.757 --> 01:37:53.978]  No.
[01:37:54.298 --> 01:37:56.179]  Folks, you need to simplify.
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:57.140]  And I don't care.
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:07.088]  If dad's got to work four jobs so mom can stay home or whatever, vice versa, somebody needs to be with those children at least until they're ten or they're not going to be your children.
[01:38:07.388 --> 01:38:10.551]  They're going to be Nike and Viacom's children.
[01:38:11.111 --> 01:38:29.398]  And you know and because the mother's in the workplace and because they both mother and father especially like I said into these huge metropolitan areas where they spend between one and three hours a day just commuting when they come home from work they throw garbage on the table they're too tired to go to the
[01:38:32.592 --> 01:38:36.574]  And now they know the parents are getting really selfish.
[01:38:36.614 --> 01:38:37.454]  They want to go to the gym.
[01:38:37.474 --> 01:38:38.335]  They want to go to the bar.
[01:38:38.615 --> 01:38:42.057]  The schools are saying we'll keep them with after school until 8 o'clock at night.
[01:38:43.357 --> 01:38:44.738]  It's tragic what's going on.
[01:38:46.759 --> 01:38:57.124]  I travel all over the United States and I end up in these cities and hotels and I turn on the cable and I see the city council meeting 7 o'clock at night.
[01:38:57.424 --> 01:38:58.625]  There's three people there.
[01:38:59.099 --> 01:39:05.368]  Three people who care enough about what these cretins and craven polteroons are doing behind their back.
[01:39:05.789 --> 01:39:06.931]  Where is the rest of the people?
[01:39:07.311 --> 01:39:12.539]  They either don't know, or they're too tired when they come home from the rat race at night.
[01:39:13.038 --> 01:39:14.018]  You know, that's a good word.
[01:39:14.678 --> 01:39:15.459]  Craven.
[01:39:15.879 --> 01:39:26.481]  And the definition of craven, I looked that up a few years ago, but just willfully and lustfully abusing and doing evil and just reveling in evil, I believe is one of the main definitions for that.
[01:39:26.721 --> 01:39:28.581]  What's your definition for craven?
[01:39:28.601 --> 01:39:29.421]  That's it.
[01:39:29.481 --> 01:39:35.403]  And poltergeist means, you know, absolutely the most corrupt scoundrel that you can, you know, define.
[01:39:35.783 --> 01:39:37.163]  And that's all these people are.
[01:39:37.785 --> 01:39:42.106]  You know, they live in their little petty fiefdoms, whether it's city council or mayor.
[01:39:42.126 --> 01:39:43.326]  And they love it!
[01:39:43.346 --> 01:39:51.728]  And again, I'm not knocking things, but the way they revel in their clothes, and revel in their vehicles, and get off on the power, and they just love it!
[01:39:52.049 --> 01:39:54.929]  Whereas, I mean, I've got a lot of responsibilities and a little bit of power.
[01:39:55.209 --> 01:39:57.690]  I have to do it, but it is a burden!
[01:39:58.050 --> 01:40:00.391]  They just revel in power!
[01:40:00.711 --> 01:40:01.251]  Oh, they do!
[01:40:01.391 --> 01:40:05.872]  And when I lived up in Northern California, and when I ran for Congress up there,
[01:40:06.465 --> 01:40:15.411]  I attended these County Board of Supervisors meetings, and I'm a people watcher, and I watch these people, especially the women, you know?
[01:40:15.711 --> 01:40:21.996]  They sit there with their fingernails painted and their hair all sprayed up, and they don't know a damn thing about the Constitution.
[01:40:22.056 --> 01:40:24.057]  What I don't get is they're like living in their own head.
[01:40:24.157 --> 01:40:29.921]  You can see them smiling and like getting off themselves to who they are.
[01:40:29.941 --> 01:40:35.145]  Until the people get mad enough and recall them, and when I ran for Congress,
[01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:43.746]  Right after the election, the people were so mad in Tehama County, they threw three of their County Board of Supervisors out of their jobs.
[01:40:44.107 --> 01:40:47.389]  They recalled a Sheriff and a Superior Court Judge.
[01:40:47.809 --> 01:40:49.150]  All in one fell swoop.
[01:40:49.351 --> 01:40:49.911]  Good job.
[01:40:50.131 --> 01:40:51.953]  You know, speaking of schools, I want to play this clip.
[01:40:52.773 --> 01:40:58.898]  This is out of the East, but I've got another report here out of Arkansas, one out of Austin, all over the country.
[01:40:59.038 --> 01:41:00.159]  Well, here's the headline.
[01:41:01.249 --> 01:41:04.213]  Arkansas, a new safety scanner for schools.
[01:41:04.313 --> 01:41:11.461]  Bryan Elementary Schools, the first school in the county to use the new state-of-the-art technology, and it's a federal grant, aimed at keeping kids safe.
[01:41:11.501 --> 01:41:12.623]  They say it is, so it is.
[01:41:13.023 --> 01:41:16.768]  That's thanks to a grant from the Department of Justice, the new Raptor scanner.
[01:41:17.488 --> 01:41:19.109]  Uh, is in place starting Monday.
[01:41:19.149 --> 01:41:25.091]  The Raptor scans the IDs of everyone who tries to pick up a child from the school and is in sync with local police departments.
[01:41:25.372 --> 01:41:27.352]  Well, what if you live by the school and you don't drive?
[01:41:27.773 --> 01:41:30.614]  Yeah, you know, well, what if you don't want to show your ID to get your child?
[01:41:30.934 --> 01:41:31.614]  It's a prison.
[01:41:31.654 --> 01:41:32.475]  Barbed wire fence.
[01:41:32.515 --> 01:41:33.755]  They search the kids every day.
[01:41:33.775 --> 01:41:39.017]  Uh, they do this out there at the so-called Independent School District.
[01:41:39.778 --> 01:41:42.539]  Uh, there in Westlake, outside Austin.
[01:41:43.610 --> 01:41:44.851]  I want to play this newscast.
[01:41:44.871 --> 01:41:47.453]  It's about three minutes long, DV Kid, and get your take on it.
[01:41:47.894 --> 01:41:53.258]  And again, folks, this has nothing to do with stopping pedophiles or child kidnappers or drug dealers.
[01:41:54.118 --> 01:41:58.922]  Statistically, there are going to be more pedophiles and child abusers in the school running it.
[01:41:59.263 --> 01:42:00.203]  Principals and teachers.
[01:42:00.243 --> 01:42:01.464]  I'm not saying all of them.
[01:42:01.785 --> 01:42:04.327]  I'm saying statistically many times more likely.
[01:42:05.007 --> 01:42:10.091]  And again, this is about the state letting you know they're the boss and training you to show your ID to do anything.
[01:42:10.412 --> 01:42:10.972]  Here's the clip.
[01:42:11.624 --> 01:42:18.928]  Bryant Elementary becomes the first school in the country to use new state-of-the-art technology aimed at keeping children safe.
[01:42:19.448 --> 01:42:25.611]  Thanks to a grant from the Department of Justice, the new Raptor scanner is in place and it started today.
[01:42:26.012 --> 01:42:33.996]  The Raptor scans the IDs of everyone who tries to pick up a child from the school and it's in sync with local police departments.
[01:42:34.396 --> 01:42:37.678]  Fox 16's Jennifer Akers has more on this new technology.
[01:42:38.743 --> 01:42:40.003]  It's probably my worst nightmare.
[01:42:40.283 --> 01:42:44.204]  You know, I get a call from the school saying, you know, someone took your child.
[01:42:45.244 --> 01:42:47.145]  Yeah, that was probably the worst thing to happen.
[01:42:47.285 --> 01:43:00.067]  LaGina Holt is like many parents worried that a break in the security system at her child's school could mean that a stranger, a sexual predator, or even a dangerous family member could walk off with her child.
[01:43:00.507 --> 01:43:05.128]  That's why administrators lobbied for a $1,500 grant from the U.S.
[01:43:05.148 --> 01:43:06.228]  Department of Justice
[01:43:06.628 --> 01:43:07.248]  They got it!
[01:43:07.408 --> 01:43:15.031]  And today at Bryant Elementary, the Raptor is making sure students don't go home with anyone they're not supposed to.
[01:43:15.051 --> 01:43:19.933]  When parents come to Bryant Elementary to pick up their kids, the first thing they do is report to the office.
[01:43:20.334 --> 01:43:22.534]  Then they have to hand over their driver's license.
[01:43:22.615 --> 01:43:25.756]  It's then scanned into the National Database for Sexual Predators.
[01:43:26.156 --> 01:43:29.057]  The whole process takes about 15 seconds.
[01:43:29.417 --> 01:43:35.960]  Bryant Elementary Assistant Principal Mark Scarlett says the process is easy on them and on you.
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:36.940]  You hit scan.
[01:43:37.421 --> 01:43:39.142]  You can see the scanning process begins.
[01:43:39.222 --> 01:43:41.483]  Your driver's license is going through the Raptor technology.
[01:43:41.823 --> 01:43:42.984]  And then your picture's going to come up.
[01:43:43.184 --> 01:43:45.265]  And it sends your name through the national database.
[01:43:45.345 --> 01:43:50.868]  And then, if you get the all clear, the Raptor prints out a visitor label that must be worn.
[01:43:50.908 --> 01:43:56.191]  The moment that it comes up here, it comes up to the Bryant Police Department, the Little Rock Police Department.
[01:43:56.231 --> 01:43:57.172]  It lets everybody know.
[01:43:57.592 --> 01:44:12.003]  Scarlett says the Raptor lets everyone know within a few seconds if the person trying to take your child is a convicted sex offender, not authorized to pick up your child, or has a background that might compromise the safety of the campus.
[01:44:12.023 --> 01:44:14.284]  It keeps up with attendance, it keeps up with parties.
[01:44:14.585 --> 01:44:20.389]  There's a lot of other uses this thing has, but the main use is it's able to protect our students and of course
[01:44:20.809 --> 01:44:21.650]  Protecting our students.
[01:44:22.050 --> 01:44:27.393]  You know, when parents send them here, that's one of the first things they want us to be able to do, is make sure their kids are safe.
[01:44:27.433 --> 01:44:31.395]  Gina says the Raptor helps her breathe a little easier.
[01:44:31.535 --> 01:44:33.556]  That's one thing, one less thing I have to worry about.
[01:44:33.916 --> 01:44:36.118]  You know, with anybody coming up here and doing anything.
[01:44:36.258 --> 01:44:37.238]  Let's stop right there.
[01:44:38.139 --> 01:44:40.480]  Now, we have another piece that's from Ohio.
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:42.561]  I guess the piece we sent up there was one from Arkansas.
[01:44:42.581 --> 01:44:45.983]  No, I just told my guys to send that clip, and I guess they sent another one, but that one's even worse.
[01:44:46.483 --> 01:44:47.824]  I hadn't heard that one or seen it.
[01:44:49.005 --> 01:44:49.886]  Now let's stop right there.
[01:44:49.926 --> 01:44:51.267]  That's a point I forgot to tell you.
[01:44:52.448 --> 01:45:06.798]  This is a criminal database hooked into the federal and local police departments and you heard the tardies and the absences are kept on your child's file and not just if you're a sexual predator.
[01:45:06.918 --> 01:45:11.081]  Oh now everybody at the school knows dad when he was 18
[01:45:12.823 --> 01:45:19.307]  Uh, when a dumb teenager got talked into breaking into that house, and he's got a conviction for burglary?
[01:45:21.008 --> 01:45:26.732]  Well, now, everybody's gonna know it, and see, the policy is maybe Dad can't pick you up.
[01:45:27.737 --> 01:45:31.219]  You see how that, you hear the gov, that little effeminate hick voice.
[01:45:31.639 --> 01:45:35.802]  Yeah, I just hate those people.
[01:45:36.382 --> 01:45:37.943]  They're just, oh, absolute trash.
[01:45:38.523 --> 01:45:40.044]  And this is how they do it.
[01:45:40.064 --> 01:45:40.704]  Let me tell you something.
[01:45:40.964 --> 01:45:45.707]  Statistically, it's the teachers and the principals, but then it gets even worse with the truancy officers.
[01:45:45.867 --> 01:45:49.529]  Number one group, highest group statistically of pedophiles.
[01:45:50.089 --> 01:45:52.091]  The CPS workers right up there with them.
[01:45:52.671 --> 01:45:56.393]  Again, the highest, most dense area.
[01:45:57.476 --> 01:45:58.057]  Per capita.
[01:45:59.119 --> 01:46:01.222]  And now they're going to know everything about your child.
[01:46:01.282 --> 01:46:03.746]  Most schools are now thumb scanning to get school lunches.
[01:46:03.766 --> 01:46:04.687]  No cash allowed.
[01:46:05.008 --> 01:46:06.089]  They've got a record of that.
[01:46:07.091 --> 01:46:09.154]  You've got to show your ID to get your children.
[01:46:10.206 --> 01:46:13.089]  And you notice he said TARDIS all over the country under federal grants.
[01:46:13.389 --> 01:46:15.932]  They've taught him that three TARDIS means an absence.
[01:46:15.972 --> 01:46:22.338]  Then they start criminal proceedings when one absence isn't even criminal under every state I know of.
[01:46:23.079 --> 01:46:24.840]  Truancy laws, but it doesn't matter.
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:25.661]  It's color of law.
[01:46:25.781 --> 01:46:30.706]  Parents still sign their kids over onto probation every day in Austin.
[01:46:30.846 --> 01:46:31.407]  Every day.
[01:46:31.987 --> 01:46:35.270]  They have little jails they've built on with judges in portable buildings.
[01:46:35.310 --> 01:46:35.970]  It's been on the news.
[01:46:36.231 --> 01:46:37.552]  Heck, we've aired those newscasts here.
[01:46:38.312 --> 01:46:40.714]  And they get them into the system right there.
[01:46:41.615 --> 01:46:41.975]  Okay?
[01:46:42.015 --> 01:46:44.217]  And there's no law, but see, it's contract.
[01:46:44.257 --> 01:46:45.298]  So the parents don't know.
[01:46:45.558 --> 01:46:48.340]  And Judge Jean Meir, for the news cameras, went down and did it herself.
[01:46:48.781 --> 01:46:49.762]  She's got a huge complex.
[01:46:49.782 --> 01:46:50.622]  They're adding on to it.
[01:46:50.822 --> 01:46:52.424]  This is from a butch haircut, you know, the type.
[01:46:53.044 --> 01:46:58.689]  She's sitting there, and Judge Jean Meir just screams at the parents saying, Sign it!
[01:46:59.069 --> 01:47:00.150]  Sign the document!
[01:47:01.013 --> 01:47:07.417]  It's about getting your kids into the system so later they can really get into the system and really get raped in the prison.
[01:47:08.454 --> 01:47:14.097]  Again, it's about killing you, hurting you, getting you into the system, ruining you by a criminal system.
[01:47:14.278 --> 01:47:16.899]  You got a bunch of good ol' boys and well-meaning idiots.
[01:47:17.159 --> 01:47:19.681]  It's for our children's safety!
[01:47:20.141 --> 01:47:20.661]  Bull!
[01:47:21.122 --> 01:47:21.622]  Bull!
[01:47:22.022 --> 01:47:22.502]  Bull!
[01:47:22.883 --> 01:47:23.323]  Bull!
[01:47:23.863 --> 01:47:34.409]  Just like you arrested one of my employees out front of the office last night for having a expired license, and the cops admitted that they're told not to arrest illegals for having no license!
[01:47:35.710 --> 01:47:36.851]  Two cops admitted it!
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:40.320]  It's a bunch of baloney!
[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:41.801]  I'm sorry, Devey, I'm ranting.
[01:47:41.841 --> 01:47:43.241]  Do you have any comments?
[01:47:43.501 --> 01:47:52.923]  My comment about that tape is that, first of all, the federal government has no authority to give grants to school districts for any type of money like that.
[01:47:53.243 --> 01:48:01.225]  There's nothing in Article 1, Section 8 that allows for the stealing from the public treasury for this type of so-called grant.
[01:48:01.673 --> 01:48:07.878]  You know, I guarantee you there are hundreds of parents listening in Austin in a couple schools like out at Westlake where they do this.
[01:48:07.918 --> 01:48:08.959]  They need to get down there.
[01:48:09.179 --> 01:48:15.165]  They need to expose the fact that this goes into a criminal database and is meant to have the police department watching your kid.
[01:48:15.485 --> 01:48:16.346]  That's what it's about.
[01:48:16.386 --> 01:48:21.370]  It's about clients that they're going to get into their system so these fat hogs can have more payments.
[01:48:22.311 --> 01:48:27.215]  And it's also about conditioning the American people and children at the earliest age
[01:48:27.751 --> 01:48:29.812]  To accept totalitarian government.
[01:48:29.832 --> 01:48:30.132]  That's right.
[01:48:30.212 --> 01:48:33.393]  Mommy and Daddy got a show ID to get you from the stockade.
[01:48:33.693 --> 01:48:41.776]  And parent... The American people have... And I hate to paint everybody with a broad brush, but they've literally become... They're degenerate scum.
[01:48:42.276 --> 01:48:43.836]  They're cowards and sissies.
[01:48:43.876 --> 01:48:45.137]  They're afraid of their own doubt.
[01:48:45.177 --> 01:48:46.157]  Cowardly filth, yes.
[01:48:46.397 --> 01:48:55.440]  You know, I'm a parent and, you know, I... Every time one of these Jessica Lunsford's or this other little boy who's just found out, it makes me sick.
[01:48:55.973 --> 01:48:59.795]  But what they're doing has nothing to do with keeping your children safe.
[01:48:59.875 --> 01:49:02.557]  Look, look, child kidnapping has gone way down in the last 20 years.
[01:49:02.577 --> 01:49:07.299]  They hype it to scare everybody, and then meanwhile, DynCorp is loading jets with little kids every day.
[01:49:07.319 --> 01:49:08.140]  I know.
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:16.424]  Well, educating and exposing all of this is the best thing that we can do, and as far as the videos that you have, Terror Storm,
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:22.923]  I always tell people, you know, there's so many Americans out there, I believe, are afraid of the truth.
[01:49:23.323 --> 01:49:26.545]  They know something's wrong, but they don't want to confront it.
[01:49:26.645 --> 01:49:28.486]  And so I, this is the advice I give.
[01:49:29.116 --> 01:49:34.397]  Give the video, the DVD, to somebody, ask them to watch it, and ask them for their opinion.
[01:49:34.837 --> 01:49:38.578]  People love to have, you know, somebody say, gee, I value your opinion.
[01:49:38.918 --> 01:49:44.019]  That way they'll watch it, instead of just saying, here, you need to watch this, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[01:49:44.339 --> 01:49:47.560]  Just say, gee, Joe, can you watch this and give me your opinion about it?
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:49.941]  It's a good angle, D.V.
[01:49:49.961 --> 01:49:50.941]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[01:49:56.189 --> 01:49:59.390]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:59.731 --> 01:50:01.631]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.032 --> 01:50:09.675]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.365 --> 01:50:17.427]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.808 --> 01:50:29.231]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.552 --> 01:50:33.473]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.493 --> 01:50:35.434]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.774 --> 01:50:39.615]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.246 --> 01:50:58.468]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.608 --> 01:51:06.712]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:06.972 --> 01:51:14.015]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.195 --> 01:51:15.476]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:15.556 --> 01:51:21.461]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.641 --> 01:51:26.745]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.845 --> 01:51:35.733]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:35.993 --> 01:51:39.295]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:51:41.377 --> 01:51:41.637]  We're good.
[01:51:52.888 --> 01:52:00.815]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:52:01.276 --> 01:52:04.439]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[01:52:56.013 --> 01:52:59.054]  This is not America, little piece of me.
[01:52:59.794 --> 01:53:02.055]  Little piece of you, we die.
[01:53:04.295 --> 01:53:05.656]  We're good to go.
[01:53:24.443 --> 01:53:36.513]  We've got senior editor of the Village Voice, Wayne Bryant, popping in for about 20 minutes to give us his detailed analysis and past articles he's overseen and written about the criminal Rudolph Giuliani.
[01:53:37.013 --> 01:53:42.958]  But Mike works here in the office and they just moved over to Westlake and he just discovered all this.
[01:53:42.998 --> 01:53:43.739]  He's been talking about it.
[01:53:43.759 --> 01:53:44.520]  He's real mad about it.
[01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:45.741]  He has his badge.
[01:53:46.583 --> 01:53:55.611]  And I don't know what Mike's going to do, but I drug Mike in here because they're under this Raptor system and Mike's worked as a paramedic and done a lot of other stuff in the government.
[01:53:55.671 --> 01:53:56.772]  He knows it is illegal.
[01:53:57.232 --> 01:54:03.978]  They have the school secretary over there at the high school running plates off cameras just randomly.
[01:54:04.438 --> 01:54:10.243]  It's just an old part of the police state and he sat there in the office before there, you know, to pick up his son if he's sick.
[01:54:11.184 --> 01:54:14.647]  And he just sat there for about 20 minutes, you said, and was watching this.
[01:54:15.367 --> 01:54:16.688]  Well, I'm saying what you saw.
[01:54:16.728 --> 01:54:17.889]  You can just tell folks.
[01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:19.711]  But you said, yeah, it's right up to Travis County.
[01:54:19.751 --> 01:54:20.732]  This is why it's illegal.
[01:54:21.453 --> 01:54:29.259]  Without opening a criminal file, violating your privacy, they're taking all data on your children and putting it on a government, federally controlled database.
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:29.880]  It's illegal.
[01:54:30.060 --> 01:54:31.021]  You need to sue them, Mike.
[01:54:31.301 --> 01:54:33.483]  In fact, maybe we can support you in a lawsuit.
[01:54:33.844 --> 01:54:34.584]  Would you like to sue them?
[01:54:35.265 --> 01:54:35.625]  I'm serious.
[01:54:35.645 --> 01:54:36.106]  Let's sue them.
[01:54:36.126 --> 01:54:37.567]  Let's stop the Raptor system.
[01:54:38.098 --> 01:54:39.999]  And that's definitely something I've thought about before.
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:41.500]  That's cool.
[01:54:42.701 --> 01:54:43.142]  Surprising.
[01:54:43.842 --> 01:54:44.883]  Yeah, it's very interesting.
[01:54:44.903 --> 01:54:54.129]  The Raptor system, they didn't tell us, you know, when they first scanned our driver's license, their reasoning is so we can make you a little ID to put on so you're a visitor in the building.
[01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:57.372]  Oh, all these slave grids are just, oh, they don't tell you if you're lined up, yeah.
[01:54:57.652 --> 01:55:06.378]  And they, you know, don't tell you they're doing anything with your driver's license other than scanning it for the picture so that they can put it on there and get your information, your address and everything off it.
[01:55:07.359 --> 01:55:11.262]  Um, then they give you a nice little label to wear if you walk through the school and it says you're a visitor.
[01:55:11.282 --> 01:55:13.584]  And then they'll say, we're just trying to keep the kids safe!
[01:55:13.664 --> 01:55:14.225]  Baloney!
[01:55:14.405 --> 01:55:16.327]  They're getting them into the criminal justice system!
[01:55:16.847 --> 01:55:22.532]  But this particular school district is, the school is divided into four different buildings, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th.
[01:55:22.992 --> 01:55:25.094]  But you have to do that process with each building.
[01:55:25.154 --> 01:55:29.038]  It's not just one to go, not just one to go through.
[01:55:30.071 --> 01:55:38.158]  But you have to do it with each different building, so it's obviously it's not an integrated system to allow you just a visitor.
[01:55:38.178 --> 01:55:40.419]  They're checking you each time you enter each building.
[01:55:40.439 --> 01:55:43.622]  Now, you worked in EMS, so you've seen the procedures, you know what goes on.
[01:55:43.922 --> 01:55:46.044]  Tell folks what you saw that time you were sitting in the office.
[01:55:46.484 --> 01:55:55.652]  Well, I noticed their security officer, which is obviously a school employee, was having their office secretary run license plates for illegally parked cars, which
[01:55:57.263 --> 01:56:07.772]  No, when I started looking at what she's doing, I see that she's connected to a Travis County Sheriff's system, which my knowledge is, is you're only supposed to be a law enforcement agency to be able to access that.
[01:56:07.792 --> 01:56:12.736]  Yeah, your knowledge is right, and even if you're a cop, you better be in the specific thing that you're looking for.
[01:56:12.816 --> 01:56:16.800]  You can't just go around and run a plate just for, you can't just run it to run it.
[01:56:16.820 --> 01:56:19.422]  I mean, you have to have a specific reason, but I noticed they're right.
[01:56:19.442 --> 01:56:25.027]  Mike, I think you ought to sue them, and they've only put this in 40 or 50 schools we know of, and again, I mean,
[01:56:25.708 --> 01:56:31.442]  I can't sue everybody, I mean, but, uh, I mean, it's one of the few... DB Kid, what do you think about this?
[01:56:31.462 --> 01:56:33.166]  The age group of this school.
[01:56:34.472 --> 01:56:36.553]  Your son's a freshman, isn't he?
[01:56:36.873 --> 01:56:38.033]  A freshman in high school?
[01:56:38.453 --> 01:56:44.014]  And the school's afraid that the freshman in high school's going to allow a child predator to come and pick him up?
[01:56:44.354 --> 01:56:46.815]  They don't even know what their parents look like?
[01:56:46.915 --> 01:56:49.795]  Well, look, we know what this is for, and you said it, Davey, last segment.
[01:56:49.815 --> 01:56:52.356]  It's to train everybody to see the parents showing the ID.
[01:56:52.376 --> 01:56:53.196]  You show the ID.
[01:56:53.516 --> 01:56:54.216]  You're prisoners.
[01:56:54.757 --> 01:56:55.537]  What a joke.
[01:56:55.977 --> 01:56:57.357]  I thought you were talking about... I mean, my son's a freshman.
[01:56:57.417 --> 01:56:58.517]  We could do whatever we wanted to.
[01:56:58.617 --> 01:57:00.618]  I thought you were talking about five-year-old kids.
[01:57:01.298 --> 01:57:01.838]  That's absurd!
[01:57:01.858 --> 01:57:03.259]  These are high school kids!
[01:57:03.619 --> 01:57:04.560]  Oh my God!
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:08.902]  Well, you have to fight it or it'll just spread like cancer.
[01:57:10.323 --> 01:57:11.963]  Mike, I guarantee you what they're doing is illegal.
[01:57:11.983 --> 01:57:12.964]  But see, that's how it works.
[01:57:13.024 --> 01:57:14.505]  They're all allowed to break the law.
[01:57:14.825 --> 01:57:16.005]  It's like the illegal aliens.
[01:57:17.006 --> 01:57:19.047]  The cops last night said, yeah, we arrest citizens.
[01:57:19.087 --> 01:57:21.308]  We're not going to arrest illegal aliens for no ID.
[01:57:22.288 --> 01:57:24.109]  And they just said, we're fired if we do.
[01:57:24.129 --> 01:57:25.190]  And they said, we don't like it either.
[01:57:26.082 --> 01:57:28.825]  I mean, it's just the end of the... Criminals run everything, folks.
[01:57:28.845 --> 01:57:30.507]  We'll be... DBKid, one minute break.
[01:57:30.527 --> 01:57:31.628]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.049 --> 01:57:37.934]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:48.886 --> 01:57:49.527]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.207 --> 01:57:51.288]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.969 --> 01:57:53.249]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.730 --> 01:57:54.530]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.311 --> 01:57:56.152]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.852 --> 01:58:00.815]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.055 --> 01:58:05.178]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:11.243]  Mike, you were just adding that everybody can go on and off the canvas.
[01:58:11.283 --> 01:58:12.423]  They don't even control that.
[01:58:12.463 --> 01:58:14.185]  No, it's parents coming in
[01:58:15.499 --> 01:58:18.841]  In high school, to be scanned and interrogated.
[01:58:20.061 --> 01:58:21.582]  It's all about getting everybody into the database.
[01:58:21.622 --> 01:58:25.163]  It's about training parents that these aren't your children and you have no right to be here.
[01:58:25.343 --> 01:58:26.484]  That's what it seems like.
[01:58:27.464 --> 01:58:30.926]  They have an open campus so the kids can leave, go to and from lunch.
[01:58:31.406 --> 01:58:37.769]  Ninth graders are not supposed to leave the campus, but my son, we found out the other day, has been going home every now and then for lunch.
[01:58:38.329 --> 01:58:39.229]  But it doesn't get caught.
[01:58:39.269 --> 01:58:40.470]  I always went home for lunch.
[01:58:40.490 --> 01:58:41.210]  They never catch him.
[01:58:41.610 --> 01:58:43.011]  I mean, I always went home for lunch.
[01:58:43.051 --> 01:58:44.971]  I live right down the street from the high school.
[01:58:45.572 --> 01:58:46.672]  And I mean, I'd run home and eat.
[01:58:46.732 --> 01:58:48.693]  I wasn't Al-Qaeda or anything.
[01:58:48.713 --> 01:58:49.813]  We live right across the street.
[01:58:49.833 --> 01:58:50.773]  Yes, I was Al-Qaeda.
[01:58:50.793 --> 01:58:51.434]  I ate it going home.
[01:58:51.454 --> 01:58:53.734]  But everything's Al-Qaeda.
[01:58:54.295 --> 01:58:54.575]  D.B.
[01:58:54.615 --> 01:58:55.935]  Kidd, I want to thank you for coming on.
[01:58:55.975 --> 01:58:59.937]  But I tell you, I'm glad you brought up schools because we had that clip.
[01:58:59.997 --> 01:59:01.177]  But hey, Mike, thanks for coming in.
[01:59:02.508 --> 01:59:05.531]  Devi, in closing, you've got about three minutes here.
[01:59:05.551 --> 01:59:06.992]  I want to get you back as a regular guest.
[01:59:07.332 --> 01:59:08.313]  What are you working on now?
[01:59:08.353 --> 01:59:09.574]  What do you see happening in the future?
[01:59:10.215 --> 01:59:16.920]  Well, I think that activists have to stay focused and not get distracted.
[01:59:17.781 --> 01:59:20.363]  You were talking about that movie, 300.
[01:59:21.043 --> 01:59:22.945]  It was written by a guy who writes comic books.
[01:59:23.846 --> 01:59:26.688]  We have to stay focused on these certain issues, like 9-11, that movement.
[01:59:28.496 --> 01:59:35.200]  Um, and also I'm going to write a series of columns about the mothers of America need to unite against taxation.
[01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:43.544]  And I'm going to target specifically women who are Democrats, because they don't understand the money trail and where the money is actually going.
[01:59:43.564 --> 01:59:47.246]  And if we can get across to them that they're being sandbagged,
[01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:56.478]  You know, with the big lie about, you know, your taxes fund education and all the rest of this... No, your taxes fund the destruction of individuality in the people.
[01:59:56.538 --> 01:59:56.758]  Right.
[01:59:57.139 --> 02:00:03.324]  But if we can get these working... There are huge voting bloc out there, and they simply don't understand the money trail.
[02:00:03.344 --> 02:00:06.047]  So I'm going to focus on that in a bunch of upcoming columns.
[02:00:06.127 --> 02:00:09.130]  But things are going to get very, very bad.
[02:00:09.190 --> 02:00:10.491]  People do not understand
[02:00:11.125 --> 02:00:13.907]  The whole situation with the housing market and construction.
[02:00:14.367 --> 02:00:19.510]  The stock market, 30% of it, is comprised of the housing and construction industry.
[02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:20.890]  And it's in the toilet.
[02:00:21.351 --> 02:00:24.953]  You know what happened earlier this week when the Dow took another dive down over 200?
[02:00:25.933 --> 02:00:32.497]  Greenspan then, when it came back up, came out and said, yeah, the bubble's going to burst, because they want it to go down now, that little piece of trash.
[02:00:32.797 --> 02:00:37.019]  Of course they do, but they brought in the Plunge Protection Team and they pumped it back up.
[02:00:37.355 --> 02:00:46.277]  But we know that they can't continue doing it, and as a matter of fact, about half an hour before I went on the show, I got a call from a guy who's going to pick up Dr. Edwin here in a little while.
[02:00:46.297 --> 02:00:58.159]  They're on their way to New Hampshire, and Edwin would like to get on your show to talk about his new book on reconstituting the state militias, because I guarantee you it's the difference between our survival and slavery.
[02:00:58.579 --> 02:00:59.379]  Well, let me get him on.
[02:00:59.419 --> 02:01:00.499]  Let me get you back on.
[02:01:00.519 --> 02:01:01.440]  Maybe we can get you both on together.
[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:02.980]  I'll call Kevin and give him his phone number.
[02:01:03.692 --> 02:01:04.172]  Well, D.B.
[02:01:04.212 --> 02:01:10.936]  Kidd, again, newsreviews.com you're right for, and we always link over to your stuff, to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:01:11.417 --> 02:01:29.967]  I just, to know that these schools are criminally running databases and opening criminal files on children and keeping tabs with their non-criminal material in a criminal database, just to see just everything they do, I mean, the governor is saying it's the law, you've got to take this vaccine, when there's no law, it's just another hoax!
[02:01:30.007 --> 02:01:31.048]  These people are criminals!
[02:01:31.576 --> 02:01:36.181]  Well, the best thing that we can do, of course, is to keep educating people.
[02:01:36.201 --> 02:01:41.186]  And like I said earlier, I have found it very effective to get DVDs like Terror Storm.
[02:01:41.226 --> 02:01:41.927]  It's excellent.
[02:01:42.467 --> 02:01:46.171]  And give it to somebody who doesn't believe what's going on.
[02:01:46.781 --> 02:01:48.701]  And just say, gee, I value your opinion.
[02:01:48.741 --> 02:01:50.262]  Could you watch this and get back to me?
[02:01:50.602 --> 02:01:51.202]  And it works.
[02:01:51.742 --> 02:01:52.902]  And it shocks people.
[02:01:52.942 --> 02:01:55.503]  That's a good approach, is to say, give me your take on this.
[02:01:55.543 --> 02:01:56.543]  What do you think about this?
[02:01:56.583 --> 02:02:00.504]  Yeah, because we hear all of these conspiracy theories and this, that, and the other.
[02:02:00.824 --> 02:02:02.404]  People just, you know, they push away.
[02:02:02.464 --> 02:02:04.925]  But if you, people, everybody's got an ego.
[02:02:05.105 --> 02:02:05.985]  I'm not any different.
[02:02:06.025 --> 02:02:08.165]  I try to keep mine under control, you know.
[02:02:08.345 --> 02:02:10.246]  But I have found it works.
[02:02:10.466 --> 02:02:12.266]  And people used to ask me all the time,
[02:02:12.686 --> 02:02:14.346]  How can I get somebody to read your booklet?
[02:02:14.386 --> 02:02:15.607]  It's only 44 pages.
[02:02:15.807 --> 02:02:17.127]  And I would just tell them to do that.
[02:02:17.507 --> 02:02:20.228]  Tell them, ask them to read it and give you their opinion.
[02:02:20.548 --> 02:02:22.408]  And the next thing you know, they're an activist.
[02:02:23.308 --> 02:02:28.730]  Another great way is for teachers and college professors, which they are doing, is tell their classes to do papers on it.
[02:02:28.770 --> 02:02:29.310]  Make them do it.
[02:02:29.950 --> 02:02:32.471]  Listen, DV Kid, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:02:32.711 --> 02:02:34.411]  You're a sweetheart and we hope to talk to you soon.
[02:02:34.651 --> 02:02:35.531]  Okay, bye bye.
[02:02:35.731 --> 02:02:36.211]  Take care.
[02:02:36.271 --> 02:02:37.732]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:47.595 --> 02:02:53.043]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:53.404 --> 02:03:01.015]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:08.793]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:09.193 --> 02:03:20.618]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.918 --> 02:03:24.420]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:26.821]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:27.141 --> 02:03:31.003]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:44.326 --> 02:03:45.087]  Terrorism!
[02:03:45.227 --> 02:03:45.987]  Terrorism!
[02:03:46.087 --> 02:03:52.171]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:03:52.411 --> 02:03:54.012]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:03:54.252 --> 02:03:56.734]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:03:57.114 --> 02:04:11.683]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:11.723 --> 02:04:12.023]  government.
[02:04:12.223 --> 02:04:14.004]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:04:14.384 --> 02:04:20.305]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:20.445 --> 02:04:24.906]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[02:04:44.252 --> 02:04:45.973]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:04:46.133 --> 02:04:47.414]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:04:47.614 --> 02:04:50.436]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:04:50.796 --> 02:04:53.578]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:04:54.098 --> 02:05:00.842]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:05:45.726 --> 02:05:51.750]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:52.351 --> 02:05:55.393]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:56.073 --> 02:06:02.098]  That's right, it's a war, it's an information war, and we're not about left or right, we're about right and wrong, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:03.479 --> 02:06:08.222]  And I can find few people more distasteful than Rudolph Giuliani.
[02:06:09.303 --> 02:06:10.884]  Maybe Hillary Clinton, George Bush,
[02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:17.263]  Uh, I mean, these people are just, it's just, they're absolutely despicable across the board.
[02:06:18.384 --> 02:06:30.770]  And, uh, we have the, uh, head honcho, uh, the main editor, senior editor of the Village Voice, Wayne Barrett, who's out in a documentary film about Giuliani that we're going to play a trailer of in a few minutes, Giuliani Time.
[02:06:31.131 --> 02:06:35.193]  He's also got a book out, Grand Delusion, The Untold Story of Rudy Giuliani and 9-11.
[02:06:35.213 --> 02:06:38.134]  Well, I tell you, they wrote this stuff at the right time.
[02:06:38.154 --> 02:06:39.395]  Who would have known he'd be the frontrunner?
[02:06:39.475 --> 02:06:40.756]  What a, how scary.
[02:06:41.779 --> 02:06:43.541]  I mean, I never thought I'd vote for a Democrat.
[02:06:43.581 --> 02:06:44.161]  I may have to.
[02:06:45.082 --> 02:06:45.683]  It doesn't matter.
[02:06:45.783 --> 02:06:46.563]  They're all puppets.
[02:06:47.044 --> 02:06:52.268]  He's got stories he's been writing like Hijacking History, Rudy Heist, City Archives, He Shaped His Own Legend.
[02:06:53.349 --> 02:06:55.211]  He wrote that back in 2002.
[02:06:55.551 --> 02:06:59.295]  There's just so much to talk about with our guests, we're just going to have to get bullet comments from him.
[02:06:59.975 --> 02:07:05.280]  Another one he wrote for The Nation, just back in September of last year, Cashing In on Catastrophe.
[02:07:06.387 --> 02:07:08.749]  Giuliani's law firm tied to Venezuela's Chavez.
[02:07:08.789 --> 02:07:09.469]  It goes on and on.
[02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:12.611]  Thank you for coming on with us, sir.
[02:07:12.631 --> 02:07:14.252]  I really do appreciate it, Mr. Barrett.
[02:07:14.753 --> 02:07:16.494]  Well, I'm very glad to be here.
[02:07:17.675 --> 02:07:21.257]  Let's first get into why the firefighter union hates him.
[02:07:21.297 --> 02:07:23.238]  I mean, they have Republicans and Democrats to speak.
[02:07:23.258 --> 02:07:24.139]  They're nonpartisan.
[02:07:24.659 --> 02:07:27.321]  They're tired of him grandstanding, they say, out of the gates.
[02:07:28.442 --> 02:07:32.024]  How does everybody call him America's mayor and this hero when New Yorkers hate his guts?
[02:07:33.244 --> 02:07:35.965]  Well, it's not just the firefighters union.
[02:07:36.545 --> 02:07:59.771]  On the fifth anniversary, on the night of September 11th, while every national network had Rudy on and was treating him as if it was a month after 9-11 didn't have a critical question to raise, the 24-hour news station in New York, New York One, which is owned by Time Warner, had the head of the police union and the head of the fire union from New York City on, both of whom said America's Mayor Bunk
[02:08:00.265 --> 02:08:01.927]  Why is he on all these networks?
[02:08:02.027 --> 02:08:18.483]  They saluted the book that Dan Collins and I did, and the questions that we raised in the book about all of the issues that involve firefighters, often 9-11, whether you start with the fact that he put the command center in 7 World Trade.
[02:08:18.723 --> 02:08:21.726]  I hope your command center is not in the World Trade Center complex.
[02:08:22.475 --> 02:08:35.346]  But, you know, he put the Trade Center, the Command Center there, and that resulted in all kinds of communication difficulties that day, where the police radios were predicting the collapses of the towers.
[02:08:35.366 --> 02:08:37.988]  He also worked with Bush and the EPA to cover up the dust.
[02:08:38.068 --> 02:08:39.189]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[02:08:39.469 --> 02:08:39.689]  Yeah.
[02:08:39.909 --> 02:08:50.398]  Well, I mean, there's no question, but the firefighters are very upset about all the respiratory problems that so many of them and so many of the police officers and other first responders and even the construction workers
[02:08:51.181 --> 02:09:01.087]  Thousands of them having all these respiratory problems and they were reassured, not just by Christy Whitman, the EPA Commissioner, but reassured directly by Rudy that there was no problem down there.
[02:09:01.894 --> 02:09:06.198]  When Ground Zero looked like it was going smoothly, it was another feather in Rudy's cap.
[02:09:06.278 --> 02:09:14.484]  Everybody in the national press said how quickly it was being cleaned up, but now that it turns out it was a toxic disaster, suddenly Rudy doesn't have anything to do with it.
[02:09:22.402 --> 02:09:26.566]  I brought up this Venezuela thing, and you said that's not even in the first 200 things I've covered.
[02:09:26.886 --> 02:09:33.131]  Let's run down the top 10 things as a guy who's been covering and following and writing books about Giuliani.
[02:09:33.171 --> 02:09:35.593]  Number one, when did you start not liking him?
[02:09:35.713 --> 02:09:38.735]  What first turned you on to the fact that he's a creep?
[02:09:39.636 --> 02:09:44.560]  I've been looking at him, and he's such a creep and such a hypocrite and such a liar and such a snake.
[02:09:44.780 --> 02:09:45.961]  I just can't say enough.
[02:09:46.882 --> 02:09:48.363]  You're somebody who really knows this guy.
[02:09:48.383 --> 02:09:49.123]  You're up in New York.
[02:09:49.163 --> 02:09:49.704]  Tell us about him.
[02:09:50.672 --> 02:10:13.622]  Well, I actually met him in the seventies when he was a private attorney and I knew him all the time and covered him very closely while he was the United States Attorney here in New York and he was an extremely effective federal prosecutor and actually I admired many of the things he did at that time and wrote a book called City for Sale in which he was the hero of that book and he brought major public corruption cases against the Koch administration.
[02:10:13.662 --> 02:10:15.603]  So there was a day when I greatly admired him.
[02:10:17.119 --> 02:10:22.260]  I have watched the transformation of this guy over the years and he's now... When did he join the dark side?
[02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:23.300]  When did you see the change?
[02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:32.302]  Well, I think he really kind of did it when he began to flounder as a mayor early in his mayorality.
[02:10:32.342 --> 02:10:40.943]  And I think he sort of saw himself as going in the direction here where he had to find a new political identity.
[02:10:41.383 --> 02:10:45.844]  And starting around 1995, which is in the second year of his first term as mayor,
[02:10:46.661 --> 02:10:50.593]  He took on this kind of fierce partisan air and he
[02:10:53.343 --> 02:10:54.803]  You know, he had some successes.
[02:10:54.924 --> 02:10:59.525]  Obviously, everyone says that he had some successes in reducing crime in New York.
[02:10:59.585 --> 02:11:08.227]  What very few people know is that it reduced... The crime was going down in all seven FBI categories for 36 months before he became mayor.
[02:11:08.727 --> 02:11:11.248]  But everybody seems to think he started this trend.
[02:11:11.308 --> 02:11:18.750]  But no, it actually started under our only black mayor, David Dinkins, and crime went down for 36 consecutive months before he took office.
[02:11:19.170 --> 02:11:21.251]  But certainly, he helped drive it down further.
[02:11:22.952 --> 02:11:34.557]  But his problems, I would say, if you had to list that ten, I'd start with his relationship with the black community, which was always the most poisonous relationship that I've ever observed as a reporter in New York.
[02:11:35.178 --> 02:11:38.839]  I mean, I think it was clearly one of the things that turned me off to him as a mayor.
[02:11:38.899 --> 02:11:46.642]  He wouldn't even meet with Carl McCall, who was the state comptroller, the highest elected black official in New York, who came from Citibank, by the way.
[02:11:46.662 --> 02:11:48.043]  We're not talking about somebody
[02:11:48.835 --> 02:11:51.238]  You know, who's a big protester or something like that.
[02:11:51.278 --> 02:11:53.200]  Did Giuliani have a problem with blacks?
[02:11:53.761 --> 02:11:55.202]  It's a fundamental problem with him.
[02:11:55.222 --> 02:11:58.126]  He wouldn't meet or talk to any of the black leadership in New York.
[02:11:58.146 --> 02:12:03.011]  People think, oh, well, he just wouldn't talk to Al Sharpton and the guys pounding the pavement.
[02:12:03.071 --> 02:12:06.675]  No, he wouldn't talk to a banker who was the state controller.
[02:12:06.695 --> 02:12:10.059]  He refused to meet with him because the guy wanted to audit his crime data.
[02:12:11.858 --> 02:12:17.741]  And I think the books that I've written raise substantial questions about whether or not he was juicing that data.
[02:12:18.361 --> 02:12:24.284]  So that is a fundamental problem that he had as mayor that predated 9-11.
[02:12:25.084 --> 02:12:34.268]  And you would have to just look at the polls and you could see that Giuliani had only about 25 to 35 percent favorables in the various polls that existed.
[02:12:34.768 --> 02:12:38.270]  On September 10th, that's how unpopular he was in the city.
[02:12:39.537 --> 02:12:43.021]  He was already considering creating a consulting company at that time.
[02:12:43.041 --> 02:12:44.943]  He eventually created Giuliani Partners.
[02:12:45.223 --> 02:12:47.045]  Let's talk about the cashing in.
[02:12:47.085 --> 02:12:48.547]  This guy has cashed in.
[02:12:49.368 --> 02:12:51.730]  There's no question, but he's now a multi-millionaire.
[02:12:51.850 --> 02:12:54.113]  Giuliani Partners is basically a 9-11 firm.
[02:12:56.003 --> 02:13:05.067]  It markets itself as a security firm, as a firm of great integrity and character that can advise corporations, and it's made a fortune since 9-11.
[02:13:05.127 --> 02:13:13.930]  We describe in the book the largest single client of Giuliani Partners, Nextel, and the nature of that relationship.
[02:13:14.430 --> 02:13:21.373]  And that entirely revolved around a post-9-11 pitch to the Federal Communications Commission
[02:13:22.351 --> 02:13:47.920]  to get additional frequencies and bands for Nextel, for its phone system, and it was all pivoted around the fact that they were, that Nextel was trouncing on all the frequencies of public safety communications across the country, was interfering with them to such a great degree that Giuliani was able to make the case to the FCC and to others that you have to allow
[02:13:49.219 --> 02:13:52.141]  We're good to go.
[02:14:12.330 --> 02:14:19.271]  Of his firm now, a Texas firm that used to be known as Bracewell & Patterson and is now known as Bracewell & Giuliani.
[02:14:19.311 --> 02:14:26.193]  And Giuliani joined this law firm and was made a named partner in the firm within the last couple of years.
[02:14:26.533 --> 02:14:36.435]  And it turns out, who would be surprised that a major Texas law firm represents just about everyone in the energy business, so who would be surprised that they represent Citgo?
[02:14:37.333 --> 02:14:41.054]  Well, basically what he did is he, this was a political combination.
[02:14:41.094 --> 02:14:43.874]  You know, this law firm has represented Tom DeLay for years.
[02:14:44.314 --> 02:14:46.515]  They handled all the ethics charges against him.
[02:14:47.175 --> 02:14:52.996]  You know, and so this is the firm he hooks up with down there to give himself both a corporate and a political base in Texas.
[02:14:53.876 --> 02:15:03.098]  And, um, you know, you, you don't pick all of your own clients, but if you join a law firm like that and you make that kind of a business decision, don't be surprised with what happened.
[02:15:03.138 --> 02:15:05.699]  The two law firms that he was associated with in New York,
[02:15:06.588 --> 02:15:15.950]  One of them, before he became mayor, and this is around the time of the Gulf War, represented 11 companies that did direct business with Saddam Hussein.
[02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:23.711]  He personally represented one of those companies and they were supplying chemical weapons and arms to Saddam's regime.
[02:15:24.371 --> 02:15:26.332]  So, he has a long history of this.
[02:15:26.952 --> 02:15:33.253]  If you wind up with Republican white shoe law firms, who do you think their clients are?
[02:15:34.429 --> 02:15:36.130]  And, obviously, he made this choice.
[02:15:36.170 --> 02:15:38.291]  He really didn't need to make the choice.
[02:15:38.311 --> 02:15:39.872]  He didn't have any partners going.
[02:15:40.252 --> 02:15:44.254]  He didn't need to make the choice to have an additional law firm that he was involved with.
[02:15:44.294 --> 02:15:45.254]  He already had an extremely good one.
[02:15:45.274 --> 02:15:48.376]  Well, he's got to come join up with the Texas Mafia if he's going to win.
[02:15:49.136 --> 02:15:52.198]  Well, he's now joined up with this law firm, yeah.
[02:15:53.038 --> 02:15:56.540]  Now, and they are the mob, folks, hijacking history.
[02:15:56.580 --> 02:16:00.002]  Tell us about him grabbing all the 9-11 stuff for himself.
[02:16:01.340 --> 02:16:02.841]  Well, not just the 9-11 stuff.
[02:16:02.881 --> 02:16:05.263]  What he did was he really violated the city charter.
[02:16:06.985 --> 02:16:28.262]  And in the final week in office in December of 2001, remember he leaves office a few months after 9-11, he essentially seized all of the records that were maintained by any of the deputy mayors and his own chiefs of staff and so forth, the top city hall staff, and he put them in a warehouse in Queens.
[02:16:29.758 --> 02:16:35.119]  And he has been filtering those records back into the public archive.
[02:16:35.239 --> 02:16:41.440]  Most of them are back by now, but who knows what was put back in and what was shredded.
[02:16:41.580 --> 02:16:42.741]  No one will ever know.
[02:16:42.801 --> 02:16:50.102]  I mean, that's very dirty to grab this important segment of history, sequester it, probably have his goons in there, and then slowly filter it.
[02:16:50.122 --> 02:16:51.422]  Yeah, he's in there editing history.
[02:16:51.462 --> 02:16:53.003]  It's a big memory hole.
[02:16:53.343 --> 02:16:55.363]  I mean, just that behavior alone shows guilt.
[02:16:56.664 --> 02:17:00.246]  Well, I think what it shows is he wanted to write his own history.
[02:17:00.727 --> 02:17:02.528]  And so this is what he's been able to do.
[02:17:02.768 --> 02:17:04.609]  He's seized all these records.
[02:17:04.649 --> 02:17:06.030]  He's had them ever since 2001.
[02:17:06.330 --> 02:17:09.492]  He has slowly given them back to the City Archive.
[02:17:10.072 --> 02:17:11.733]  No mayor has previously done that.
[02:17:11.773 --> 02:17:13.074]  What was his excuse for that?
[02:17:14.261 --> 02:17:27.043]  Well, his contention was that this was a contribution to the city, that he was going to make, that he created a foundation, some of his friends and other law firms created a foundation.
[02:17:27.203 --> 02:17:28.503]  Oh, how nice!
[02:17:29.304 --> 02:17:35.985]  And that they would put these records together in a presentable public fashion and then return them to the city archives.
[02:17:36.125 --> 02:17:37.265]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:17:37.425 --> 02:17:40.986]  That would be like him signing City Hall over to himself.
[02:17:41.066 --> 02:17:43.126]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:17:43.146 --> 02:17:43.466]  Stay there.
[02:17:45.162 --> 02:17:48.645]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:17:48.685 --> 02:17:49.205]  are located?
[02:17:49.406 --> 02:17:52.788]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:17:53.009 --> 02:17:57.733]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:17:58.013 --> 02:18:03.017]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[02:18:03.297 --> 02:18:03.617]  I think so.
[02:18:21.872 --> 02:18:23.633]  Hi folks, Jack Browner here from Midas Resources.
[02:18:23.673 --> 02:18:24.674]  The real money folks.

[02:18:55.485 --> 02:18:56.365]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:18:56.405 --> 02:18:57.026]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300.
[02:18:57.086 --> 02:18:57.446]  A 5% increase.
[02:18:57.466 --> 02:18:59.888]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the Euro.
[02:18:59.908 --> 02:19:01.789]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[02:19:01.809 --> 02:19:03.270]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[02:19:03.290 --> 02:19:04.732]  A 16% increase in real money.
[02:19:20.563 --> 02:19:23.605]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[02:20:09.002 --> 02:20:14.185]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.

[02:21:48.159 --> 02:22:02.804]  Here's a short little trailer for the film about Giuliani, Giuliani Time, that Wayne Barrett
[02:22:03.684 --> 02:22:06.485]  William J. Bratton, RN.
[02:22:06.985 --> 02:22:08.905]  Let's go ahead and roll that before we go back to our guest.
[02:22:15.587 --> 02:22:23.049]  Rudy Giuliani has been one of the truly great mayors of the city of New York.
[02:22:23.069 --> 02:22:24.249]  Maybe the best, the best ever.
[02:22:24.269 --> 02:22:27.390]  Mayor Giuliani is the oligarch's mayor.
[02:22:28.343 --> 02:22:29.483]  Oh, you dirty bully!
[02:22:29.583 --> 02:22:33.784]  And while he bullies, the powerless, he kowtows to the earth.
[02:22:35.024 --> 02:22:37.765]  These ideas about homelessness are disgusting and horrible!
[02:22:37.805 --> 02:22:41.045]  We will require them to work in exchange for shelter.
[02:22:41.145 --> 02:22:43.226]  This man's answer was incarceration.
[02:22:43.246 --> 02:22:47.106]  Squeegee men are a more priority to him than people who are engaged to them.
[02:22:47.126 --> 02:22:50.467]  The city of dependency had made it into a city of workers!
[02:22:50.507 --> 02:22:53.807]  We have Mickey Mouse programs that put almost nobody to work.
[02:22:53.867 --> 02:22:57.068]  What makes you a good man is making you cool.
[02:23:00.353 --> 02:23:01.494]  Giuliani knows when he's good.
[02:23:01.514 --> 02:23:04.915]  He knows when he's violating people's civil rights and constitutional rights.
[02:23:04.975 --> 02:23:05.436]  He knows.
[02:23:05.496 --> 02:23:05.916]  Who cares?
[02:23:05.956 --> 02:23:06.356]  Who cares?
[02:23:06.456 --> 02:23:20.543]  If this is what the Brooklyn Museum wants to do, present nude men, dung on the Blessed Mother, public funds should not be used to support sick demonstrations by people, even if they call themselves artists.
[02:23:22.637 --> 02:23:27.439]  New York continues to be a city that exudes love for all of the people of the city.
[02:23:27.719 --> 02:23:28.779]  That was two of them.
[02:23:28.839 --> 02:23:32.040]  If I talk to anyone I would run to me.
[02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:34.941]  They kill me and they kill me.
[02:23:34.961 --> 02:23:35.902]  It looks pretty interesting.
[02:23:35.942 --> 02:23:36.902]  I can't wait to see it.
[02:23:36.922 --> 02:23:48.026]  You know, the big thing here is his police state tendencies, his tendency to violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution, to grandstand, to lie, and then break the law himself and abscond and do all the things he's involved in.
[02:23:48.386 --> 02:23:49.707]  Is it scary to you
[02:23:51.007 --> 02:23:56.708]  Wayne Barrett, to know that, as much as you know about Rudolph Giuliani, that he could end up being the President?
[02:23:58.389 --> 02:24:00.389]  It's a pretty scary concept, Alex.
[02:24:00.549 --> 02:24:14.032]  You know, when you mention the Bill of Rights, the New York Civil Liberties Union and other groups in the city brought as many as 19 or 20 First Amendment lawsuits involving the Giuliani administration, and they won every one of them.
[02:24:14.712 --> 02:24:18.913]  The Giuliani administration never really won a major civil liberties case.
[02:24:19.631 --> 02:24:27.454]  And this is a guy who, you know, not only is a lawyer, but was at one point in time the number three guy in the Justice Department.
[02:24:27.494 --> 02:24:37.037]  And he seemed to have no limits where, you know, in terms of the First Amendment rights of people in this town.
[02:24:37.397 --> 02:24:41.738]  And pretty remarkably, he did... Well, let me ask you a question, because I've talked to a lot of New Yorkers.
[02:24:41.758 --> 02:24:43.259]  I've got a New Yorker that works in my office.
[02:24:44.002 --> 02:24:48.924]  And they say that before Giuliani got in, there were some bad cops, but that most of them were friendly.
[02:24:49.325 --> 02:24:50.325]  I've been in New York a lot.
[02:24:50.925 --> 02:24:55.708]  I know you don't ask a cop for directions, because half the time they'll scream at you and say, get the bleep out of here.
[02:24:56.368 --> 02:24:58.589]  I mean, it's really the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.
[02:24:59.069 --> 02:25:02.271]  And it seems like that was encouraged by Giuliani.
[02:25:02.351 --> 02:25:04.012]  I mean, is that partly the blame on him?
[02:25:04.052 --> 02:25:05.593]  I mean, how did the police change under him?
[02:25:05.893 --> 02:25:10.415]  Well, when you asked me to do my list of 10, I tell you, two of the ones that bothered me the most
[02:25:10.755 --> 02:25:11.056]  We're good.
[02:25:20.772 --> 02:25:32.075]  And these 16-year-old boys were lying in their hospital beds with their parents around them, and were both in critical condition, and both of them managed to survive.
[02:25:32.115 --> 02:25:39.097]  But in these two separate instances, Giuliani held press conferences immediately and denounced the parents because the kids were out.
[02:25:39.197 --> 02:25:46.959]  One of them was out at midnight with a water pistol, and the cops mistook the water pistol for a gun and shot him six or seven times.
[02:25:47.688 --> 02:25:55.550]  Now, it's just remarkable to me that while somebody's lying on a hospital bed, you're calling a press conference to denounce the parents.
[02:25:56.230 --> 02:25:59.511]  One of them occurred at 2 o'clock in the morning, one of them occurred at midnight.
[02:25:59.571 --> 02:26:04.652]  I'll bet you Andrew Giuliani has been out at midnight and 2 o'clock in the morning.
[02:26:05.112 --> 02:26:12.194]  At the age of 16 in this town, it's not at all unusual that somebody's 16-year-old would be out at midnight.
[02:26:12.774 --> 02:26:14.095]  I snuck out the window plenty of times.
[02:26:16.335 --> 02:26:17.335]  Yeah, that's what he did.
[02:26:17.395 --> 02:26:19.836]  It was just, I mean, so he could be extremely shrill.
[02:26:19.896 --> 02:26:24.298]  Yes, he did send a message to the police that was a message of intolerance.
[02:26:25.098 --> 02:26:30.120]  Yeah, but I mean, in New York, I've seen families ask cops, Officer, you know where this is?
[02:26:30.420 --> 02:26:31.381]  They'll just scream at you.
[02:26:31.661 --> 02:26:33.161]  I mean, the cops weren't like that before.
[02:26:33.241 --> 02:26:33.842]  What happened?
[02:26:33.882 --> 02:26:35.002]  How do they act like that?
[02:26:36.053 --> 02:26:39.618]  Well, obviously, Alex, I don't know what kind of circumstances you're pointing at.
[02:26:39.658 --> 02:26:42.661]  I'm not going to certainly denounce the New York City Police Department.
[02:26:42.701 --> 02:26:43.883]  No, I don't think that's fair.
[02:26:43.903 --> 02:26:44.504]  Here's an example.
[02:26:44.544 --> 02:26:46.146]  I was talking to an Austin cop last night.
[02:26:46.166 --> 02:26:47.768]  What happened to him when he was up there?
[02:26:48.368 --> 02:26:48.548]  Yeah.
[02:26:49.089 --> 02:26:57.596]  Well, I wanted to straighten out one thing I said earlier because I wasn't too careful in what I said about Nextel, and I want to make this clear.
[02:26:57.656 --> 02:26:59.838]  They did not get those frequencies for free.
[02:26:59.878 --> 02:27:01.540]  That kind of stumbled out of my mouth.
[02:27:01.580 --> 02:27:05.403]  They had to pay for them, but they got them on a tremendous reduction.
[02:27:05.543 --> 02:27:08.466]  Well, it's also hard to get frequencies period, no matter how much money you've got.
[02:27:08.606 --> 02:27:11.228]  But I want to make that clear that they did have to pay for them.
[02:27:11.268 --> 02:27:12.149]  It was a bonanza.
[02:27:14.250 --> 02:27:15.470]  No, I understand.
[02:27:15.490 --> 02:27:16.150]  He gets a lot of them.
[02:27:16.170 --> 02:27:19.472]  Listen, your new book is out and doing quite well.
[02:27:20.252 --> 02:27:24.694]  Randallusion, Wayne Barrett, and Dan Collins, thank you for joining us, sir.
[02:27:24.734 --> 02:27:25.054]  All right.
[02:27:25.114 --> 02:27:25.514]  Thank you.
[02:27:25.734 --> 02:27:27.235]  Keep up the good work at The Village Voice.
[02:27:27.255 --> 02:27:27.375]  Okay.
[02:27:27.395 --> 02:27:27.575]  Bye-bye.
[02:27:27.655 --> 02:27:28.375]  All right.
[02:27:28.415 --> 02:27:31.776]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, to get into a lot of really important information.
[02:27:31.796 --> 02:27:32.276]  Stay with me.
[02:27:34.977 --> 02:27:35.898]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.358 --> 02:27:37.979]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.879 --> 02:27:41.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.770 --> 02:27:50.771]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:27:50.791 --> 02:27:57.213]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:27:57.553 --> 02:28:00.814]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.
[02:28:01.234 --> 02:28:03.214]  Start reading the Nationalist Times each month.
[02:28:03.475 --> 02:28:08.856]  The Nationalist Times promotes a common-sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.
[02:28:09.156 --> 02:28:13.677]  Published monthly since 1985, the Nationalist Times is a 20-page newspaper featuring
[02:28:13.677 --> 02:28:14.157]  We're good to go.
[02:28:39.065 --> 02:28:39.786]  We're good to go.
[02:28:54.858 --> 02:28:58.020]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[02:28:58.241 --> 02:29:01.943]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[02:29:02.223 --> 02:29:10.169]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.
[02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:16.834]  Get to Witness Ministries' next shocking revelation, The Rider of the White Horse, George W. Bush in Prophecy.

[02:29:22.857 --> 02:29:26.319]  Unless she repents, America will not survive the Red Horse of World War III.
[02:29:44.108 --> 02:29:46.691]  Right now, 65% of Americans are overweight.
[02:29:46.851 --> 02:29:52.998]  Experts say by the year 2010, that number will increase to 75% and 35% will be obese.
[02:29:53.139 --> 02:30:02.289]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach, host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, has done extensive research and has found what he believes is the biggest breakthrough in weight loss in 50 years.
[02:30:02.529 --> 02:30:03.270]  It's called Slender FX.

[02:30:50.776 --> 02:30:52.216]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:16.977 --> 02:31:20.638]  Okay, I haven't read the book.
[02:31:20.759 --> 02:31:23.200]  We did have a copy here in the office, and Kevin scanned through it.
[02:31:23.540 --> 02:31:26.722]  I didn't know this, and I guess we only went through two or three of the bad things about Giuliani.
[02:31:27.242 --> 02:31:30.664]  The book was really about, and I'd known this, but I'm glad it was in the book.
[02:31:30.704 --> 02:31:32.365]  I was starting to think that was kind of a weak interview.
[02:31:32.385 --> 02:31:38.628]  Giuliani's dad was a big leg-breaker for the mob, and he's basically Italian mafia.
[02:31:40.234 --> 02:31:41.194]  So, I mean, what do you expect?
[02:31:41.254 --> 02:31:44.875]  But, uh, I already knew that, but, you know, of course, the Justice Department.
[02:31:45.435 --> 02:31:49.096]  It's just, the mob sends their kids to, you know, get in the Justice Department.
[02:31:50.116 --> 02:31:52.337]  Well, I mean, that's, we're a criminal society.
[02:31:52.377 --> 02:31:55.358]  We deserve a penguin-like, you know, gangster running everything.
[02:31:57.578 --> 02:32:00.019]  Piece of trash that was involved in the attack on those towers.
[02:32:01.319 --> 02:32:02.519]  It doesn't matter, they're all puppets.
[02:32:02.539 --> 02:32:07.321]  Whether it's Hillary or Newt Gingrich, it doesn't matter, they're all gangsters.
[02:32:08.121 --> 02:32:08.981]  Gangsterism.
[02:32:09.887 --> 02:32:12.349]  Alberto Gonzales, George Bush, all of them.
[02:32:12.369 --> 02:32:13.950]  They're a bunch of gangsters.
[02:32:15.892 --> 02:32:19.975]  Alright, there's this amazing BBC four-hour documentary.
[02:32:19.995 --> 02:32:24.278]  I don't know how long it'll be up on Google and YouTube, but it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:32:24.718 --> 02:32:26.060]  We have links to it right now.
[02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:35.467]  And we should do a report on it, because it gets into stuff I already knew, and I've only watched about two hours of it over the last two days.
[02:32:36.247 --> 02:32:37.048]  Hour and a half, I don't know.
[02:32:39.904 --> 02:32:58.813]  There was this big 60's movement to really try to make some change and it got infiltrated and then major institutions, major research facilities got in and figured out how to target the new independent person that didn't want to be part of the conformancy and conforming, but really it was the opposite.
[02:32:58.833 --> 02:33:07.417]  It was just conforming them to a new totally self-centered system that promised to free you when in truth it just broke up any society and any capacity to resist.
[02:33:08.559 --> 02:33:10.721]  And, uh, there's too much of this to air.
[02:33:10.781 --> 02:33:16.085]  I'll air a few minutes of this clip and then a few minutes of the next, but it talks about how, like, they invented Ronald Reagan.
[02:33:16.405 --> 02:33:23.150]  They knew that the non-conformists in people and that the population would become anti-government and anti-control.
[02:33:23.170 --> 02:33:33.037]  They actually knew that it was the liberals that would want to vote for Ronald Reagan, and they did all these scientific tests, and that's why he won by landslides, uh, well, a big landslide the second time.
[02:33:34.295 --> 02:33:37.597]  I'm not... Ronald Reagan was an actor, folks.
[02:33:37.617 --> 02:33:42.301]  Ronald Reagan actually did believe some of what he was saying, too, but he was a total puppet, is the point here.
[02:33:42.341 --> 02:33:44.082]  Well, let's just go into these clips.
[02:33:44.302 --> 02:33:44.962]  Here's the first one.
[02:33:45.723 --> 02:33:50.206]  A hundred years ago, a new theory about human nature was put forward by Sigmund Freud.
[02:33:51.587 --> 02:33:57.551]  He had discovered, he said, primitive sexual and aggressive forces hidden deep inside the minds of all human beings.
[02:34:00.003 --> 02:34:01.143]  That's the wrong clip.
[02:34:01.564 --> 02:34:03.144]  I sent you four one-hour clips.
[02:34:03.184 --> 02:34:07.347]  I'm talking about clip one and two out of the three-hour clip.
[02:34:11.850 --> 02:34:13.491]  I guess that's just the point you backed it up to?
[02:34:13.511 --> 02:34:16.232]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:34:17.013 --> 02:34:19.834]  The two clips I need out of the... You know how there's three clips?
[02:34:20.295 --> 02:34:22.516]  Well, there's four on that page.
[02:34:23.577 --> 02:34:24.877]  Looks like we're not going to be able to air it.
[02:34:25.478 --> 02:34:25.878]  It's okay.
[02:34:27.306 --> 02:34:29.570]  I guess I just didn't send clear directions.
[02:34:30.452 --> 02:34:32.154]  It's the third block.
[02:34:32.174 --> 02:34:33.136]  You know, there's three blocks.
[02:34:33.697 --> 02:34:35.199]  Well, there's four blocks, but it's the third block.
[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:36.782]  The third one-hour piece.
[02:34:37.583 --> 02:34:38.885]  I wanted it eight minutes in.
[02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:42.421]  To, uh, okay, so, um, okay, great.
[02:34:42.661 --> 02:34:44.621]  So here it is, eight minutes in, and then here's the next clip.
[02:34:44.801 --> 02:34:47.302]  My fault, not giving proper direction, as usual.
[02:34:47.322 --> 02:34:48.522]  Uh, here it is.
[02:34:49.122 --> 02:34:51.042]  A year later, Reich died in prison.
[02:34:51.062 --> 02:35:00.564]  To the Freudians, it seemed as if their main threat had been removed forever.
[02:35:00.604 --> 02:35:01.365]  But they were wrong.
[02:35:02.365 --> 02:35:07.986]  What the Freudians didn't realize was that their influence in American society was also about to be challenged.
[02:35:08.826 --> 02:35:17.271]  And in a way that would lead not only to their decline, but to the dramatic resurgence of Reich's ideas in America and throughout the capitalist world.
[02:35:19.752 --> 02:35:25.936]  The consumer is king.
[02:35:26.776 --> 02:35:31.419]  His whim makes or unmakes manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers.
[02:35:32.140 --> 02:35:34.781]  Whoever wins his confidence wins the game.
[02:35:35.561 --> 02:35:37.983]  Whoever loses his confidence is lost.
[02:35:39.105 --> 02:35:44.528]  By the late fifties, psychoanalysis had become deeply involved in driving consumerism in America.
[02:35:45.689 --> 02:35:48.030]  Most advertising companies employed psychoanalysts.
[02:35:48.771 --> 02:35:53.553]  And as last week's episode showed, they had created new ways to understand consumers' motives.
[02:35:54.234 --> 02:35:59.677]  Above all, with the focus group, in which consumers re-associated their feelings about products.
[02:36:01.338 --> 02:36:07.121]  Out of this came new ways to market products, by appealing to the hidden, unconscious desires of the consumer.
[02:36:09.808 --> 02:36:12.910]  But in the early 60s, a new generation emerged who attached this.
[02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:19.555]  They accused American business of using psychological techniques to manipulate people's feelings and turn them into ideal consumers.
[02:36:40.797 --> 02:36:42.518]  Advertising was manipulation.
[02:36:42.718 --> 02:36:47.360]  It was a way to get you to do something that didn't come out of you.
[02:36:48.441 --> 02:36:49.641]  It came out of somebody else.
[02:36:49.921 --> 02:36:58.525]  Somebody else said, this year you should be wearing powder pink shirts with matching powder pink buck shoes.
[02:36:59.286 --> 02:37:00.947]  And I said, why?
[02:37:02.367 --> 02:37:03.328]  That's not who I am.
[02:37:03.868 --> 02:37:05.108]  That's who somebody else is.
[02:37:05.669 --> 02:37:08.270]  They wanted you to be somebody who would buy their stuff.
[02:37:08.928 --> 02:37:13.570]  This whole feeling of being somebody else's tool.
[02:37:14.170 --> 02:37:14.910]  I don't want to be that.
[02:37:15.330 --> 02:37:16.971]  I don't want to be somebody else's man.
[02:37:17.551 --> 02:37:18.291]  I want to be me.
[02:37:22.273 --> 02:37:26.134]  In the mid-sixties, a protest movement began on America's campuses.
[02:37:26.934 --> 02:37:30.455]  One of the students' main targets was corporate America.
[02:37:30.856 --> 02:37:34.517]  They accused the corporations of brainwashing the American public.
[02:37:35.297 --> 02:37:37.738]  Consumerism was not just a way of making money,
[02:37:38.439 --> 02:37:46.002]  It had become the means of keeping the masses docile, while allowing the government to pursue a violent and illegal war in Vietnam.
[02:37:47.683 --> 02:37:51.445]  The student's mentor was a famous radical philosopher called Herbert Marcuse.
[02:37:52.385 --> 02:37:56.347]  Marcuse had studied psychoanalysis and was a fierce critic of the Freudians.
[02:37:57.508 --> 02:38:04.771]  They had, he said, helped to create a world in which people were reduced to expressing their feelings and identities through mass-produced objects.
[02:38:05.965 --> 02:38:10.330]  It was one of the most striking phenomena to see to what extent
[02:38:22.463 --> 02:38:36.774]  The ruling power structure could manipulate, manage and control not only the consciousness but also the subconscious and unconscious of the individuals.
[02:38:37.615 --> 02:38:50.005]  And this took place on a psychological basis by the controls and the manipulation of the unconscious primary drive which Freud stipulated
[02:38:51.332 --> 02:38:53.254]  Think about it, dear American people out there.
[02:38:54.155 --> 02:38:56.116]  You're all brainwashed, kiddies.
[02:38:56.917 --> 02:38:57.778]  You're all brainwashed.
[02:38:57.798 --> 02:38:58.498]  That's why you're here.
[02:38:58.518 --> 02:38:59.779]  They're saying right now, kill the bum.
[02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:08.987]  Look at you in the living room, you know, you're saying, kill me.
[02:39:09.127 --> 02:39:17.715]  Following the logic of Marcuse's argument, the new student left set out to attack the system of social control, which was summed up in the slogan,
[02:39:18.490 --> 02:39:20.595]  There is a policeman inside all our heads.
[02:39:21.016 --> 02:39:22.018]  He must be destroyed.
[02:39:23.361 --> 02:39:28.552]  And that policeman was going to be destroyed by overthrowing the state and the corporations that had put him there.
[02:39:29.856 --> 02:39:40.380]  One group, the Weathermen, began a series of bomb attacks on companies that they said both controlled people's minds through consumer products and made the weapons being used in Vietnam.
[02:39:41.020 --> 02:39:46.502]  There's no way to be committed to non-violence in the middle of the most violent society that history's ever created.
[02:39:46.682 --> 02:39:48.743]  I'm not committed to non-violence in any way.
[02:39:52.779 --> 02:39:56.921]  We want to live a life that isn't based on materialistic values.
[02:39:57.282 --> 02:40:03.405]  And yet the whole system of government and the economy of America is based on profit, on personal greed and selfishness.
[02:40:03.946 --> 02:40:07.848]  So that in order to be human... Again, you have to watch it in its...
[02:40:08.843 --> 02:40:09.243]  Yes, we are.
[02:40:30.237 --> 02:40:35.058]  And then their leaders, after Ken State, tell them, no, we'll just go inward and only care about ourselves.
[02:40:35.498 --> 02:40:36.659]  Do as thou wilt.
[02:40:37.259 --> 02:40:42.220]  And then it turns out, by the last part that comes after this, that they become the ruling class.
[02:40:42.660 --> 02:40:44.701]  And now they're just like, so what if I take your children?
[02:40:44.761 --> 02:40:45.781]  I'm a CPS judge.
[02:40:46.101 --> 02:40:47.142]  At least I'm living in a $500,000 house.
[02:40:49.328 --> 02:40:51.230]  So what if things, you know, that's just the way it is.
[02:40:51.330 --> 02:40:52.691]  Moral relativism.
[02:40:53.071 --> 02:40:54.392]  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[02:40:54.632 --> 02:40:56.873]  Until nobody cares about anybody, everything just falls apart.
[02:40:57.474 --> 02:40:58.955]  But I wanted to fast forward to the 80s.
[02:40:58.995 --> 02:41:00.316]  This was in the 60s and 70s.
[02:41:01.637 --> 02:41:07.621]  And show Stanford Research Institute and how they were trying to, the government was trying, the corporations were trying to measure
[02:41:08.999 --> 02:41:19.426]  Who people were that were trying to get out of the system and didn't want to buy into the mass programming, but really they just repackaged it and reprogrammed.
[02:41:20.507 --> 02:41:26.531]  And really that whole movement was run by the Central Intelligence Agency and the drug counterculture, all of it.
[02:41:28.112 --> 02:41:30.654]  Let's go ahead and roll that next clip.
[02:41:31.409 --> 02:41:35.893]  In 1968, Rubin, as leader of the Yippies, had led the march on Chicago.
[02:41:36.234 --> 02:41:37.755]  Now he had undergone S-training.
[02:41:38.236 --> 02:41:42.079]  I was willing to die, and I had a martyr complex in a sense.
[02:41:42.099 --> 02:41:42.860]  I think we all did.
[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:45.222]  And I'd given up that ideal of sacrifice.
[02:41:46.203 --> 02:41:50.106]  Yeah, this kind of got backed up further than I wanted, but that's kind of good to hear.
[02:41:50.147 --> 02:41:51.488]  It's this S-brainwashing.
[02:41:51.548 --> 02:41:52.549]  Oh, just feel good.
[02:41:52.949 --> 02:41:54.450]  You know, kind of like the secret now.
[02:41:54.551 --> 02:41:55.712]  You can make it all change.
[02:41:55.752 --> 02:41:57.033]  Just be in yourself.
[02:41:57.995 --> 02:42:00.816]  And then notice, see, now the yippies, they don't want to help people.
[02:42:00.856 --> 02:42:02.196]  They don't want to end war anymore.
[02:42:02.236 --> 02:42:05.217]  They just want to feel good and be little greedy snots.
[02:42:05.597 --> 02:42:07.938]  And that's who the hippies are running things today.
[02:42:08.158 --> 02:42:09.279]  The captains of evil.
[02:42:09.619 --> 02:42:10.219]  Uh, here it is.
[02:42:11.779 --> 02:42:18.121]  I'm not as, um, I'm not as overwhelmingly moved by injustice as I was.
[02:42:18.382 --> 02:42:21.042]  And now we reincarnated ourselves from within.
[02:42:21.062 --> 02:42:23.363]  Basically, the politics were lost.
[02:42:23.743 --> 02:42:26.004]  And, and, and, and totally replaced
[02:42:26.687 --> 02:42:33.408]  by this lifestyle, and then the desire to become deeper and deeper into the self.
[02:42:34.228 --> 02:42:36.569]  By now, a grandiose sense of the self.
[02:42:37.489 --> 02:42:45.250]  And my good friend, and one of the original Yippie founders, Jerry Rubin, definitely moved in that direction.
[02:42:46.610 --> 02:42:53.952]  And I think he was buying into, beginning to buy into the notion that he could be happy and fully self-developed on his own.
[02:42:54.792 --> 02:42:55.992]  Socialism in one person.
[02:42:56.837 --> 02:42:58.797]  Yes, of course you're not alone in that.
[02:42:59.278 --> 02:43:01.138]  Although that, of course, is capitalism.
[02:43:02.978 --> 02:43:03.739]  That's the whole joke.
[02:43:07.299 --> 02:43:08.000]  I think it's funny.
[02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:20.082]  I think it's funny because people spend so much of their life being bedeviled by their past, and being locked into their past, and being limited by their past.
[02:43:20.603 --> 02:43:22.663]  And there's an enormous freedom from that.
[02:43:23.223 --> 02:43:24.904]  Letting people create themselves.
[02:43:30.041 --> 02:43:36.706]  Est was only the most vivid and intense expression of an idea that was spreading rapidly through all strata of American society.
[02:43:37.987 --> 02:43:44.412]  Books and television programs promoted the idea that one's first duty was to be oneself.
[02:43:44.853 --> 02:43:49.256]  And those monitoring this shift were astonished at the speed with which the idea was spreading.
[02:43:50.757 --> 02:43:57.983]  In 1970, it was a small percentage of the total population, maybe three to five percent,
[02:43:59.298 --> 02:44:07.185]  By 1980, it had spread to the vast majority of the public, up to 80%.
[02:44:08.286 --> 02:44:10.307]  You ask the question, how do you get self-actualized?
[02:44:10.628 --> 02:44:20.376]  You take this day and you say, when I shave every morning, I look in that mirror, I say to myself, I really say this, I say, nobody is going to ruin this day for you, Wayne Dyer, nobody!
[02:44:20.536 --> 02:44:23.779]  That this preoccupation with the self and the inner self,
[02:44:24.289 --> 02:44:28.451]  Traveled and spread throughout the society in the 1970s.
[02:44:28.491 --> 02:44:37.774]  It helped me to stop living in the past and start building from today and using my experiences in a positive way to be a better person today and tomorrow.
[02:44:38.155 --> 02:44:42.996]  But then the problem comes, well, how do you be self-expressive?
[02:44:45.217 --> 02:44:51.820]  And it was at this point that American capitalism decided it was going to step in and help these new individuals to express themselves.
[02:44:53.069 --> 02:44:54.890]  And in the process, make a lot of money.
[02:44:56.610 --> 02:45:00.631]  The first thing they were going to do was to find a way of getting inside their heads.
[02:45:01.311 --> 02:45:04.752]  To discover what these new beings wanted in order to be themselves.
[02:45:06.393 --> 02:45:11.714]  This came not from Madison Avenue, but from one of the most powerful scientific research institutes in America.
[02:45:13.175 --> 02:45:17.436]  Stanford Research Institute in California worked for corporations and government.
[02:45:18.476 --> 02:45:20.377]  It had done much of the early work on computers,
[02:45:21.115 --> 02:45:25.697]  ...and was also working for the Department of Defense on what would become the Star Wars project.
[02:45:29.278 --> 02:45:40.482]  In 1978, a group of economists and psychologists at SRI decided to find a way to read, measure, and fulfill the desires of these new, unpredictable consumers.
[02:45:41.842 --> 02:45:48.745]  The idea was to create a rigorous tool for measuring
[02:45:49.654 --> 02:45:57.364]  Uh, a whole range of desires, wishes, values that prior to that time had been kind of overlooked.
[02:45:57.724 --> 02:46:00.668]  They say in business, you know, what gets measured gets done.
[02:46:02.228 --> 02:46:18.936]  We were basically telling manufacturers, if you're really going to satisfy not just the basic needs, but individuated wants, whims and desires of more highly developed human beings, you're going to have to segment.
[02:46:19.056 --> 02:46:20.617]  You're going to have to individuate.
[02:46:20.937 --> 02:46:25.959]  To do this, SRI turned for help to those who had begun the liberation of the self.
[02:46:27.140 --> 02:46:29.641]  In particular, one of the leaders of the Human Potential Movement.
[02:46:30.270 --> 02:46:32.251]  A psychologist called Abraham Maslow.
[02:46:33.631 --> 02:46:39.454]  Through observing the work at places like Asylum, Maslow had invented a new system of psychological types.
[02:46:40.975 --> 02:46:48.518]  He called it the Hierarchy of Needs, and it described the different emotional stages that people went through as they liberated their feelings.
[02:46:49.438 --> 02:46:51.659]  At the top was self-actualization.
[02:46:52.460 --> 02:46:57.482]  This was the point at which individuals became completely self-directed and free of society.
[02:47:01.505 --> 02:47:08.073]  The team at SRI thought that Maslow's hierarchy might form the basis for a new way to categorise society.
[02:47:09.194 --> 02:47:13.499]  Not by social class, but by different psychological desires and drives.
[02:47:15.101 --> 02:47:20.528]  To test this, they designed a huge questionnaire with hundreds of questions about how people saw themselves.
[02:47:21.198 --> 02:47:24.881]  You know, maybe you can fast forward a few minutes just to the part where it gets to Reagan.
[02:47:25.702 --> 02:47:27.063]  Maybe I'll air it on Monday.
[02:47:27.243 --> 02:47:29.105]  Of course, I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:47:29.125 --> 02:47:30.706]  with the new Syndicated Sunday Show I do.
[02:47:31.247 --> 02:47:39.814]  Locally, you can listen to it in Central Texas all the way to Oklahoma down to the coast of Texas on NewsRadio, 590K, LBJ, and quite a few other great affiliates that have picked us up.
[02:47:41.237 --> 02:47:42.658]  But I just can't do justice to it.
[02:47:42.718 --> 02:47:43.679]  It's playing short clips.
[02:47:43.779 --> 02:47:54.631]  But it goes on to have Reagan's main campaign manager and speechwriters admitting that it was all staged and that they knew that there was this new group that didn't trust the government, didn't buy into propaganda.
[02:47:54.992 --> 02:47:56.754]  They learned how to target niches.
[02:47:56.794 --> 02:47:58.756]  It worked really good by counterfeiting them.
[02:47:59.722 --> 02:48:03.703]  And they basically just had Reagan come out and say, get the government off your back.
[02:48:03.723 --> 02:48:04.683]  We're going to do this and that.
[02:48:04.984 --> 02:48:06.744]  And it was all just cooked up by think tanks.
[02:48:07.784 --> 02:48:10.645]  And we got bigger government, more control.
[02:48:10.745 --> 02:48:13.026]  And it'll be the same thing with Democrats getting in power.
[02:48:13.326 --> 02:48:14.366]  The same thing with Republicans.
[02:48:14.386 --> 02:48:15.186]  It'll be the same thing in 2008.
[02:48:16.907 --> 02:48:18.807]  But in the past, you could still fool people.
[02:48:18.947 --> 02:48:22.688]  Now, the population doesn't trust anybody in the government.
[02:48:22.768 --> 02:48:24.769]  So it's coming to a collision point.
[02:48:25.596 --> 02:48:27.297]  And things are swinging back the other way.
[02:48:27.357 --> 02:48:29.299]  People are not into being greedy pigs.
[02:48:30.539 --> 02:48:32.761]  So, uh, because it's not fulfilling.
[02:48:33.381 --> 02:48:34.362]  You're not designed to do that.
[02:48:34.402 --> 02:48:35.723]  You're designed to nurture.
[02:48:36.483 --> 02:48:37.704]  You're designed to have courage.
[02:48:38.224 --> 02:48:41.987]  You're designed to go through suffering and exaltation.
[02:48:47.868 --> 02:48:53.335]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:53.695 --> 02:49:01.305]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.037 --> 02:49:09.083]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.483 --> 02:49:20.972]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.233 --> 02:49:25.156]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.176 --> 02:49:27.117]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.458 --> 02:49:31.301]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:38.712 --> 02:51:40.414]  HerbalHealer.com.
[02:51:40.734 --> 02:51:43.417]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[02:51:44.818 --> 02:51:47.020]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:51:47.580 --> 02:51:50.363]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:56.434 --> 02:52:00.795]  Over the weekend I'm going to try to watch more of that four hours and find the really most important clips.
[02:52:01.355 --> 02:52:03.115]  Those are just some I was watching early this morning.
[02:52:04.416 --> 02:52:12.237]  It's an incredible four hour documentary up on PrisonPlanet.com from the BBC back in the 90's and it's accurate.
[02:52:13.057 --> 02:52:17.238]  Really the first two hours are more powerful because it admits the government was mass mind controlling.
[02:52:18.559 --> 02:52:20.799]  Here's the deal, you talk to the general public
[02:52:21.602 --> 02:52:22.324]  And you tell them.
[02:52:22.344 --> 02:52:26.252]  I mean, I took basic RTF and it was in the textbooks that they'd mass control people.
[02:52:26.874 --> 02:52:28.477]  But you tell the general public this.
[02:52:28.497 --> 02:52:30.481]  It was in my basic psychology classes.
[02:52:31.090 --> 02:52:32.311]  And they go, that's ridiculous.
[02:52:32.331 --> 02:52:33.512]  There's no manipulation.
[02:52:33.552 --> 02:52:34.773]  There's nothing going on.
[02:52:35.113 --> 02:52:37.415]  Or if it is, it's liberal or conservative bias.
[02:52:37.776 --> 02:52:40.978]  Folks, that's because they know that you're aware there's some manipulation.
[02:52:40.998 --> 02:52:42.299]  They tell you, yeah, it's liberal.
[02:52:42.599 --> 02:52:43.560]  Or, yeah, it's conservative.
[02:52:43.600 --> 02:52:44.021]  No, it's not.
[02:52:44.101 --> 02:52:45.021]  It's corporatist.
[02:52:45.422 --> 02:52:46.883]  And that means dumbing you down.
[02:52:48.204 --> 02:52:49.685]  Turning you into a mindless idiot.
[02:52:49.985 --> 02:52:51.627]  A self-centered piece of garbage.
[02:52:52.047 --> 02:52:55.330]  And they want you to be self-centered so everybody else around you is self-centered.
[02:52:55.650 --> 02:52:59.933]  So when they're CPSing you or grabbing you or putting you in the system, no one comes to your aid.
[02:52:59.973 --> 02:53:00.594]  No one cares.
[02:53:02.220 --> 02:53:08.084]  They're training you to be like a prey animal, like a bunny rabbit or a gazelle, instead of a lion or a tiger.
[02:53:08.865 --> 02:53:09.666]  What you really are.
[02:53:10.466 --> 02:53:10.787]  Okay?
[02:53:10.967 --> 02:53:12.028]  You're like a grizzly bear, folks.
[02:53:12.048 --> 02:53:16.531]  We're an aggressive, dominant species that stick together or hang separate.
[02:53:16.751 --> 02:53:18.273]  And we've always warred with each other.
[02:53:18.573 --> 02:53:23.717]  Well, they've got us busy warring with each other at the low level, while the elite is together fighting against us.
[02:53:25.799 --> 02:53:28.401]  And it is just the biggest fraud in the galaxy.
[02:53:29.515 --> 02:53:34.056]  That you're going to find enlightenment and happiness through being a greedy creature.
[02:53:34.796 --> 02:53:36.637]  And I'm not saying you shouldn't take care of yourself.
[02:53:36.677 --> 02:53:39.097]  You need to have some wealth so you can be independent.
[02:53:40.038 --> 02:53:48.040]  You know, they tell you to be greedy and self-centered because then society unravels and you really won't have friends and family to take care of you.
[02:53:49.420 --> 02:53:51.940]  Basically, everything they sell you is the opposite, okay?
[02:53:53.181 --> 02:53:56.582]  And they're openly manipulating your base instincts.
[02:53:56.602 --> 02:53:58.102]  You've got to get control of those.
[02:53:59.071 --> 02:54:00.891]  And I wrote a bunch of notes listening to those clips.
[02:54:01.252 --> 02:54:13.975]  And when I say legitimate suffering, folks, I mean the self-actualization movement or the self-centered movement tells you just be happy.
[02:54:13.995 --> 02:54:14.835]  Don't let anything get you down.
[02:54:14.855 --> 02:54:19.976]  You're supposed to get down watching an old lady get beat up by thugs or you're supposed to get down.
[02:54:21.089 --> 02:54:23.192]  Uh... when your family members die or get hurt.
[02:54:23.613 --> 02:54:27.058]  And you're supposed to get down when your child gets on drugs.
[02:54:27.338 --> 02:54:29.001]  And you're supposed to do something about that.
[02:54:29.542 --> 02:54:34.510]  You're feeling down because your body and your brain, your computer is telling you this isn't good for the tribe.
[02:54:35.279 --> 02:54:39.641]  You see, we live through the people around us, and it's not some socialist idea.
[02:54:40.102 --> 02:54:41.662]  It's that we're all interconnected.
[02:54:41.722 --> 02:54:46.605]  The socialists try to duplicate that, because they know that's a basic truth, so they counterfeit it.
[02:54:46.925 --> 02:54:49.446]  So for anything I talk about, there's the counterfeits of it.
[02:54:49.947 --> 02:54:51.928]  It just gets so sophisticated out from there.
[02:54:52.168 --> 02:54:57.311]  It's just... I don't know what else to say.
[02:54:59.469 --> 02:55:02.874]  But there is an interesting point about how these other movements start at 2-3% and then grow to 80% overnight.
[02:55:02.894 --> 02:55:03.775]  9-11 Truth and the True Paradigm.
[02:55:08.010 --> 02:55:15.096]  Which isn't some perfect paradigm, but it's closer to what we really are in reality than any of this other government-created baloney that they package as counterculture.
[02:55:15.456 --> 02:55:19.200]  This is the real deal, and we can't let it be co-opted by the New World Order.
[02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:20.741]  We can't let them hijack our movement.
[02:55:21.081 --> 02:55:31.130]  We have to all be individuals in it, being leaders, waking others up, looking at different facets, trying to expand the amount of data to be more diverse, not less.
[02:55:31.250 --> 02:55:34.633]  Little self-centered, egotistical know-it-alls.
[02:55:35.692 --> 02:55:36.733]  All right, I'm out of time.
[02:55:37.073 --> 02:55:39.234]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight, here on the Genesis Network.

[02:56:11.002 --> 02:56:16.604]  Feel sorry for the evil people, but still fight them and try to put them six feet under if you need to to defend yourself.
[02:56:17.324 --> 02:56:19.044]  Alright, God bless you all.
