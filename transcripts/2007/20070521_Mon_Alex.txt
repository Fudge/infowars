[00:00:05.297 --> 00:00:05.957]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.618 --> 00:00:07.678]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.378 --> 00:00:09.499]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:10.960]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.660]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:17.243]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:21.565]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:40.385]  Coming up in 30 minutes, we have Congressman Ron Paul's communications director.
[00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:45.027]  We have the head of the campaign coming on next Thursday, this Thursday.
[00:00:45.047 --> 00:00:56.253]  And then next Tuesday, after the holiday, we have Congressman Ron Paul coming on for a large portion of an hour, coming up next Tuesday.
[00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.894]  That out of the gates.
[00:00:58.454 --> 00:00:59.675]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:01.456]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:01:02.356 --> 00:01:10.698]  So many developments, so many leading stories and things that are of vital import as we defend the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:01:11.618 --> 00:01:12.639]  It is Monday, the 21st day of May, 2007.
[00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:15.579]  We had Professor Stephen Jones scheduled for an hour today.
[00:01:22.693 --> 00:01:31.856]  But I have decided, because of all the Ron Paul stuff that's going on, and plus Dr. Jones, the physicist exposing 9-11, is also on vacation.
[00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:44.821]  We're just going to reschedule him so he can enjoy his vacation and to have him on later this week or next week about his big paper that came out last week concerning the controlled demolitions of the towers and all the new big developments there.
[00:01:45.461 --> 00:01:48.722]  So, other than the Communications Director,
[00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.791]  The head of communications for the Ron Paul presidential campaign.
[00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:54.312]  We are not going to have any guests on today.
[00:01:54.332 --> 00:01:58.873]  We're going to have wide open phones, but not right now because I'm going to go into the news.
[00:01:58.893 --> 00:02:02.034]  But we will have open phones in the second and third hours today.
[00:02:05.235 --> 00:02:14.959]  Remember last week, the RNC, GOPAC head, who's also a big RNC chieftain, but he's the head of GOPAC, Mr. Steele,
[00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:19.256]  who is a Giuliani operative and been involved in his campaigns.
[00:02:19.877 --> 00:02:26.339]  Both Giuliani's campaign for Steele and Steele's campaign for Giuliani said that Ron Paul should be banned from the debates.
[00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:30.220]  The head of the Republican Party in Michigan called for it.
[00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:32.841]  Fox News was calling for it.
[00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.562]  Michelle Malkin was calling for it.
[00:02:35.062 --> 00:02:36.183]  One of their contributors.
[00:02:36.883 --> 00:02:38.304]  Many others were calling for it.
[00:02:39.664 --> 00:02:41.365]  They called for the boycott on Thursday.
[00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:44.666]  We launched, and you get the credit as the audience,
[00:02:45.724 --> 00:02:58.115]  The attack, the counter-attack, over 30,000 signatures were garnered with the two, and this is by yesterday, with the two different petitions that are out there.
[00:02:58.816 --> 00:02:59.896]  We talked to the RNC.
[00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:02.379]  We also have recordings folks made of talking to the RNC.
[00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:11.727]  They said they were getting over a hundred phone calls a minute for Thursday and Friday until they announced, okay, there is no plan now.
[00:03:11.767 --> 00:03:12.908]  We're dropping the plan.
[00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:15.606]  In fact, then they said, we never had a plan.
[00:03:15.626 --> 00:03:23.608]  It didn't matter if it was in the Associated Press and that he'd given a press conference to the head of the RNC in Michigan.
[00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:31.230]  Suddenly, Mr. Saul Anunez said, I had never planned that.
[00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.811]  It's an urban legend.
[00:03:32.871 --> 00:03:37.672]  It's a lie, basically, is what they came out and said, with amazing spin.
[00:03:39.091 --> 00:03:45.195]  So big victory, ladies and gentlemen, but of course they try to take our victory and say there was never a plan.
[00:03:46.456 --> 00:03:48.857]  Yeah, you know, the head of GOPAC didn't call for it.
[00:03:49.658 --> 00:03:52.039]  Michelle Malkin and Mr. Gibson didn't call for it.
[00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:55.061]  All the other big Fox shows that we have on tape didn't call for it.
[00:03:56.162 --> 00:03:57.743]  No, none of them called for it.
[00:03:59.244 --> 00:04:00.605]  Sean Hannity didn't call for it.
[00:04:01.653 --> 00:04:02.634]  No one called for it.
[00:04:02.754 --> 00:04:04.875]  We're delusional as usual.
[00:04:05.416 --> 00:04:07.237]  We need to put our tinfoil hats on.
[00:04:07.277 --> 00:04:08.538]  But there's a problem.
[00:04:08.578 --> 00:04:17.183]  We have the AP and other publications that ran the headline and that interviewed different people in the Republican Party who did do this.
[00:04:17.864 --> 00:04:22.647]  And so you've just shown more people that you are a pack of congenital liars.
[00:04:24.372 --> 00:04:26.054]  The saga doesn't start there, though.
[00:04:26.094 --> 00:04:32.240]  There were some attempts to frustrate and censor Ron Paul supporters here in Austin over the weekend.
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.301]  We'll tell you about that.
[00:04:34.262 --> 00:04:40.128]  But the big news, they are still set to try to pass total blanket amnesty today or tomorrow out of the U.S.
[00:04:40.188 --> 00:04:40.509]  Senate.
[00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:41.730]  We'll go over that for you.
[00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.473]  Also, Ron Paul goes on the offensive in Austin.
[00:04:45.507 --> 00:04:50.651]  Slams rival candidates' establishment shills, attacks GOP factions who tried to bar him from the debate.
[00:04:51.051 --> 00:04:55.094]  We have a video of that up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:04:55.475 --> 00:04:57.056]  We'll be playing the audio later.
[00:04:57.536 --> 00:04:58.497]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:58.577 --> 00:04:59.098]  Stay with me.
[00:05:04.185 --> 00:05:09.652]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.033 --> 00:05:17.582]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.368 --> 00:05:25.411]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:37.216]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.556 --> 00:05:41.478]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.498 --> 00:05:43.439]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:47.621]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:04.534 --> 00:06:07.395]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:13.839]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:21.523]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:06:21.703 --> 00:06:25.725]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.343]  Summer is once again just around the corner, and as usual, so are higher gas prices.
[00:07:05.783 --> 00:07:08.965]  This year, stop taking it on the chin and start fighting back!
[00:07:09.405 --> 00:07:17.469]  Ethos FR, a product tested and found worthy by NBC and Fox News, can save you up to 19% on fuel and reduce emissions by up to 30%.
[00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.711]  Unlike other products and gadgets you've seen advertised,
[00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:24.994]  Ethos FR attacks the source of the problem, unburned fuel.
[00:07:25.434 --> 00:07:29.176]  You see, exhaust is essentially unburned fuel that's expelled from your tailpipe.
[00:07:29.637 --> 00:07:34.480]  That equates to toxins being released into the environment and dollars being released from your wallet.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:41.444]  But with Ethos FR, fuel burns more completely, helping your engine to deliver better mileage and helping you to save money.
[00:07:42.104 --> 00:07:43.725]  And, it's so easy to use.
[00:07:44.145 --> 00:07:50.108]  Simply pour a couple of ounces into your tank at every fill up, and you're on your way to saving money and the environment.
[00:07:50.528 --> 00:07:56.911]  So, do yourself and the environment a favor, and visit ctsavegas.com to get your bottle today.
[00:07:57.192 --> 00:07:59.313]  That's ctsavegas.com.
[00:08:01.693 --> 00:08:07.296]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.421 --> 00:08:18.762]  Alright, two big tracks here on the broadcast today.
[00:08:18.823 --> 00:08:28.628]  We've got the total, complete, end of America, absolute amnesty legislation, and all of the different issues that follow that.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.662]  That entire spectrum.
[00:08:32.843 --> 00:08:36.226]  And then we've got the Congressman Ron Paul phenomenon.
[00:08:36.947 --> 00:08:43.333]  Now literally like a firestorm all over CNN, Fox, MSNBC, Bill Maher, HBO.
[00:08:43.433 --> 00:08:48.058]  During the big boxing match over the weekend they were plugging Ron Paul.
[00:08:48.538 --> 00:08:51.742]  Just out of the blue you had the commentators on the big fight.
[00:08:52.362 --> 00:08:53.645]  Just suddenly talking about it.
[00:08:53.805 --> 00:08:59.134]  This is stuff I'm catching in the advertising, I guess.
[00:08:59.394 --> 00:09:03.501]  The coalition of video clips that people send us off of the web.
[00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:05.424]  So we have that.
[00:09:06.169 --> 00:09:29.983]  We have the attempts to censor him out of the debates failing, at least on the surface, but I assure you they are still moving forward against him and we need to continue to target these organizations and target the RNC and others that have been making noises even after they capitulated to the will of the people and the First Amendment.
[00:09:30.383 --> 00:09:31.724]  So we'll be going over that.
[00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:35.286]  We have Bill Maher plugging and endorsing Ron Paul
[00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:38.462]  But is this an endorsement we even want?
[00:09:39.322 --> 00:09:47.165]  We'll also play him on CNN from Sunday edition last night and how he handled that.
[00:09:47.625 --> 00:09:54.888]  We have the entire 18-minute speech that Ron Paul gave Saturday night at the Bob Bullock Texas History Museum.
[00:09:55.842 --> 00:10:02.266]  Here in Austin, Texas, that we will be airing in the third hour, but right now we're going to go to a compilation.
[00:10:02.286 --> 00:10:03.867]  It's not really a compilation.
[00:10:03.927 --> 00:10:16.695]  It's pretty much about half of the 15 minute or so press conference that Ron Paul gave Saturday before he went in to give his speech.
[00:10:18.345 --> 00:10:26.307]  I'm not going to belabor this all day, because the congressman's campaign that I talked to Saturday and that I talked to this morning, you know, they don't want to make a big deal out of it.
[00:10:26.347 --> 00:10:27.247]  It's par for the course.
[00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:30.208]  In fact, there's been an analysis done.
[00:10:30.828 --> 00:10:35.929]  You know that MySpace has censored Ron Paul bulletins, and they've censored us as well, PrisonPlanet.com bulletins.
[00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:37.209]  And they admit this.
[00:10:37.249 --> 00:10:39.290]  This is official MySpace admissions.
[00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.370]  We have screenshots of it and everything where they admit we're censored.
[00:10:43.551 --> 00:10:45.591]  There have been official Yahoo censoring.
[00:10:47.016 --> 00:10:52.539]  Fox showed that Giuliani won the debate last Tuesday night for all of Wednesday.
[00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:57.142]  We have screenshots with the headline, Giuliani wins debate, wins polls.
[00:10:57.702 --> 00:10:59.904]  Giuliani got 15 percent, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:59.924 --> 00:11:00.904]  He was a far third.
[00:11:00.924 --> 00:11:01.825]  Doesn't matter.
[00:11:03.226 --> 00:11:07.949]  Somebody wins in public, and it was Mitt Romney by, what, one point over Ron Paul.
[00:11:08.309 --> 00:11:10.150]  Oh, by the way, the numbers on there are wrong too.
[00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.432]  It closed out with Paul at 26, Romney at 28, Giuliani at 15.
[00:11:15.917 --> 00:11:20.982]  On the poll when they finally erased it and removed it and put the truth up, that too was a lie.
[00:11:21.482 --> 00:11:25.866]  Something closer to the truth was Ron Paul by 25 instead of 26.
[00:11:27.207 --> 00:11:35.434]  Remember when Fox News a few months ago showed the most unpopular people in the world poll and they said that it was
[00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:42.171]  Somebody else, and then had George Bush at the bottom, when George Bush had actually won.
[00:11:42.191 --> 00:11:44.552]  I mean, this is premeditated.
[00:11:44.652 --> 00:11:49.995]  They have a practice of bald-faced lying in front of everyone.
[00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:51.495]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:11:52.576 --> 00:11:58.479]  There was a big article out yesterday up on prisonplanet.com by a big international polling agency that tracks all of this.
[00:11:58.799 --> 00:12:01.160]  They keep saying, Ron Paul isn't showing up in the polls.
[00:12:02.037 --> 00:12:04.199]  Ron Paul isn't in the New Hampshire polls.
[00:12:04.499 --> 00:12:05.861]  He isn't in the Texas polls.
[00:12:06.261 --> 00:12:07.783]  He isn't in the Ohio polls.
[00:12:08.643 --> 00:12:14.489]  All of the key polls and states where he would show up strong, he isn't being included.
[00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:18.613]  He isn't being included.
[00:12:19.053 --> 00:12:19.834]  So, yes,
[00:12:20.669 --> 00:12:30.755]  If they won't let you on the list of polls, if they won't use your name in the polls, which you've seen this with the online polls where Ron Paul starts winning so they pull him off the poll.
[00:12:31.115 --> 00:12:36.959]  That's probably happened six, seven, eight times I know of in Yahoo polls and other major polls.
[00:12:37.657 --> 00:12:38.558]  They're cheating!
[00:12:38.998 --> 00:12:40.339]  The people are given a choice.
[00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:41.699]  He's given prominence.
[00:12:41.999 --> 00:12:42.640]  He wins.
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:55.807]  They're afraid that 40-50% of the public that's totally dumbed down, who doesn't know his name, will learn of him and then he'll be a shoe-in to win in New Hampshire, in Ohio, in California, in Texas, other key states.
[00:12:58.627 --> 00:12:59.328]  They know this!
[00:12:59.388 --> 00:13:19.481]  Folks, when I got up on air last week and a month ago and say only Ron Paul can beat Hillary, and when I say he's the guy that can unify the country, and he's the guy that's got support from the traditional left and traditional conservatives, and that he's common sense, I mean, he gets up and gives anti-abortion speeches and Democrats are still falling all over him saying, oh, that's okay, at least he tells the truth in his anti-war.
[00:13:20.562 --> 00:13:26.066]  Because he's gotten us out of the partisanship and into a constitutional populist mode.
[00:13:26.992 --> 00:13:29.313]  Ron Paul can and should win.
[00:13:30.794 --> 00:13:31.835]  Now I've already said all this.
[00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:38.338]  The point is that we are going to get more into this polling situation because that's who we've got to target next.
[00:13:38.438 --> 00:13:39.919]  And I want to give you some of the names.
[00:13:40.159 --> 00:13:41.720]  I've got the names of the polling agencies.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.581]  I want to dig up their numbers.
[00:13:43.601 --> 00:13:44.861]  I meant to do that and I forgot.
[00:13:44.961 --> 00:13:51.705]  So I can't go over this story until I, during the breaks, get their numbers collated so I can give you some of the numbers.
[00:13:52.584 --> 00:13:58.488]  So we can call these different polling agencies and say, hey, why aren't you even putting him in the polls?
[00:13:58.888 --> 00:14:01.149]  He wins all the polls for the first debate.
[00:14:01.609 --> 00:14:03.611]  He wins out of more than 10 polls.
[00:14:03.651 --> 00:14:05.772]  He wins all of them but the Fox poll.
[00:14:06.072 --> 00:14:09.134]  He comes in second place in a 10-horse heat.
[00:14:11.076 --> 00:14:11.717]  10-way race.
[00:14:11.857 --> 00:14:12.838]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:14:13.338 --> 00:14:19.583]  And that's with all the Fox pundits saying, go vote against Paul on television when he was 33 points behind.
[00:14:19.903 --> 00:14:23.746]  So they electioneered, called out the dogs, probably stole it.
[00:14:24.046 --> 00:14:27.489]  I mean, they lie and steal and cheat on every other issue.
[00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.711]  Just amazing.
[00:14:29.751 --> 00:14:31.833]  So let's play the first part of the press conference.
[00:14:31.853 --> 00:14:33.474]  We'll go to break and play the rest of it.
[00:14:34.775 --> 00:14:37.377]  But just briefly, getting back into censorship.
[00:14:40.376 --> 00:14:43.837]  I've been to another fundraiser there a few years ago that I was invited to.
[00:14:44.657 --> 00:14:47.798]  I didn't go to this one because I didn't want to, frankly, be a distraction.
[00:14:47.818 --> 00:14:57.840]  Because I've got quite a few supporters and fans that were at this, and even my camera guys, and even Ted Anderson from Genesis was down there, and it caused quite a scene.
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:07.163]  And I would love to get to shake your hands and see you folks, but frankly, A, I had to stay home here at the office and edit, literally until I got home at 3 a.m.
[00:15:07.203 --> 00:15:08.483]  that night working on the film.
[00:15:09.363 --> 00:15:16.329]  Because I'm behind on Endgame and it's got to be sent to the distributor by the end of August at the latest.
[00:15:18.571 --> 00:15:20.512]  And I won't release it if I'm not ready.
[00:15:20.552 --> 00:15:23.135]  It just won't come out this year.
[00:15:25.957 --> 00:15:29.180]  I'll sell no wine before it's time, as they say, and this is going to be my best film.
[00:15:30.341 --> 00:15:32.402]  But I probably would have gone in there for an hour or two.
[00:15:32.462 --> 00:15:36.206]  I didn't want to distract from Ron Paul and it would have done that.
[00:15:38.797 --> 00:15:45.703]  The Bob Bullock Museum people were waiting for anyone with Alex Jones Press Pass and Infowars Press Pass.
[00:15:45.723 --> 00:15:48.525]  They walked right up to Aaron and they said, Aaron Dykes.
[00:15:49.186 --> 00:15:50.487]  His name tag just said Aaron.
[00:15:51.628 --> 00:15:53.629]  And they knew right who he was and kicked him out.
[00:15:55.351 --> 00:16:00.855]  I was telling friends about this before Saturday at a birthday party for my daughter and they were like, you think they'll target your people?
[00:16:01.356 --> 00:16:02.356]  And I said, of course they will.
[00:16:02.377 --> 00:16:03.017]  They always do.
[00:16:03.577 --> 00:16:05.599]  And they're like, oh, you're a little bit paranoid, Alex.
[00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:07.601]  But that indeed did happen.
[00:16:10.404 --> 00:16:11.645]  I didn't say paranoid.
[00:16:11.685 --> 00:16:13.246]  I was being looked at like I was a little paranoid.
[00:16:13.286 --> 00:16:13.987]  Now I understand that.
[00:16:14.007 --> 00:16:15.428]  You have to live through this to understand it.
[00:16:15.528 --> 00:16:16.649]  Aaron got kicked out.
[00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:22.313]  But I had, luckily, three other camera people who went under other names who got in.
[00:16:23.574 --> 00:16:24.894]  But it didn't just stop there.
[00:16:26.876 --> 00:16:33.741]  They tried to tell KI and local Fox and they did tell KLBJ that they couldn't come in and carry it live.
[00:16:33.781 --> 00:16:35.682]  KLBJ that also carries my show.
[00:16:36.664 --> 00:16:38.245]  NewsRadio 590K LBJ.
[00:16:38.265 --> 00:16:40.907]  They told them, you can't come in, you can't be on.
[00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:47.011]  And they said, that's just our policy that no taping is allowed.
[00:16:47.271 --> 00:16:49.012]  Now this is a state paid for building.
[00:16:49.472 --> 00:16:51.613]  I know Ken Lay and others gave money to found it.
[00:16:51.794 --> 00:16:52.454]  I'm not kidding.
[00:16:53.014 --> 00:16:54.235]  But it's right by the Capitol.
[00:16:54.315 --> 00:16:56.076]  It's got an IMAX theater on one side.
[00:16:56.376 --> 00:17:02.140]  On the other side is a really ornate... What's the style of ancient Greek?
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.942]  It's got that style of Greek architecture.
[00:17:05.856 --> 00:17:09.138]  Well, there are three ancient Greek periods, but it was the first period.
[00:17:09.158 --> 00:17:13.300]  I forget the archaeological term for it right now.
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:14.520]  It escapes me.
[00:17:15.561 --> 00:17:16.801]  But why am I even getting into that?
[00:17:16.821 --> 00:17:20.463]  The point is, it's a very nice building made out of granite.
[00:17:21.758 --> 00:17:25.639]  Almost Sonic, got a Masonic Cornerstone, big giant Lone Star out front.
[00:17:26.159 --> 00:17:28.680]  And I've been in there with my video camera in the museum videotaping.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.840]  There's no barring of it.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:39.823]  I've been in a fundraiser two years ago, and I've been at the IMAX and walked over next door many times to the gift shop, you know, to buy Texas flags, or my children beg, you know, to go to the gift shop.
[00:17:40.463 --> 00:17:45.684]  And I've seen other functions and other fundraisers and other political deals, and there's cameras everywhere.
[00:17:46.104 --> 00:17:48.565]  They told Ron Paul's campaign, hey, you can't videotape.
[00:17:49.708 --> 00:17:50.729]  That day, by the way.
[00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:53.710]  And you can't have local news cameras in here.
[00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.371]  And they started threatening to just cancel it.
[00:17:57.091 --> 00:17:59.392]  See, that's the dirtbag government, folks.
[00:18:00.532 --> 00:18:03.934]  By the way, they went ahead and passed the, quote, toll road moratorium.
[00:18:03.974 --> 00:18:05.254]  It actually isn't a moratorium.
[00:18:05.294 --> 00:18:07.175]  It allows them to build a trans-Texas corridor.
[00:18:08.817 --> 00:18:13.200]  And the agreement is still predominantly secret between the Spanish-owned company and the state of Texas.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:24.807]  We're now two years into this, and the state of Texas, the legislature, isn't allowed to see the agreement with a foreign company, a state agency, completely rogue and above the law.
[00:18:26.388 --> 00:18:29.310]  And the bill, the amnesty bill, is still secret.
[00:18:29.751 --> 00:18:32.833]  Four senators have leaked sections of it, like the Z
[00:18:34.838 --> 00:18:38.961]  provision, the new Z Visa, which is total amnesty.
[00:18:38.981 --> 00:18:40.302]  You don't have to leave the country to get it.
[00:18:40.643 --> 00:18:42.044]  You can stay for four years.
[00:18:42.384 --> 00:18:43.725]  You can bring family in.
[00:18:44.406 --> 00:18:46.127]  You never have to leave the country first.
[00:18:46.447 --> 00:18:50.671]  And then you hear the stuff on the news saying there's a $5,000 fine and you've got to leave the country.
[00:18:50.871 --> 00:18:52.132]  It's all complete lies.
[00:18:53.273 --> 00:18:55.114]  And you notice they still say the bill is a secret.
[00:18:55.474 --> 00:18:58.557]  They're set to vote on it today, but it's still a secret.
[00:19:00.436 --> 00:19:04.798]  My point is, is the state just arbitrarily says Ron Paul can't have cameras.
[00:19:05.058 --> 00:19:06.399]  And no, he can't have TV in here.
[00:19:06.999 --> 00:19:08.960]  And by the way, keep your eyes out for Alex Jones.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:09.580]  Stop him.
[00:19:10.961 --> 00:19:15.943]  State of Texas, you go pay tens of thousands of dollars to have a ball at their facility
[00:19:17.564 --> 00:19:19.245]  And then they don't let the media in.
[00:19:19.545 --> 00:19:24.607]  So Ron Paul had to have the press conference outside, but basically the media started threatening themselves.
[00:19:25.167 --> 00:19:26.408]  Ron Paul's office did not.
[00:19:26.428 --> 00:19:27.888]  They said, fine, bar the media.
[00:19:28.369 --> 00:19:41.594]  Ron Paul kind of bent with the wind like a reed, turned the other cheek, but KI, Fox, KXAN, ABC local, the local paper, others didn't put up with it, so they did have to let them in.
[00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:44.015]  But just an example.
[00:19:44.575 --> 00:19:46.356]  That in and of itself is petty.
[00:19:47.347 --> 00:19:51.874]  But the point is, this is all part of the harassment and the attempted blocking of Ron Paul.
[00:19:52.214 --> 00:19:53.356]  And I frankly have had enough of it.
[00:20:02.296 --> 00:20:04.338]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:04.978 --> 00:20:13.906]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.346 --> 00:20:21.552]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.268 --> 00:20:27.772]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.252 --> 00:20:39.080]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.842]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.382 --> 00:20:45.186]  For more information call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:20:45.226 --> 00:20:45.546]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:06.794]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:07.175 --> 00:21:12.621]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:13.081 --> 00:21:14.162]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:21:14.182 --> 00:21:18.187]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:18.887 --> 00:21:32.192]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:32.692 --> 00:21:38.015]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:38.295 --> 00:21:44.177]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:21:44.937 --> 00:21:46.739]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.779 --> 00:21:50.961]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:21:51.402 --> 00:21:52.002]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.062 --> 00:21:54.224]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:21:54.244 --> 00:21:54.304]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.583 --> 00:22:03.364]  Terrorism!
[00:22:03.504 --> 00:22:04.264]  Terrorism!
[00:22:04.364 --> 00:22:10.428]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:22:10.688 --> 00:22:12.289]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:15.011]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:22:15.391 --> 00:22:29.960]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.300]  government.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.281]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:22:32.661 --> 00:22:38.586]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:22:38.726 --> 00:22:43.210]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:49.094]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:49.134 --> 00:22:51.096]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:51.116 --> 00:22:52.877]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:23:02.723 --> 00:23:03.863]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:06.004]  I'm the Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:23:06.404 --> 00:23:09.385]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:23:09.445 --> 00:23:10.125]  is a real thing.
[00:23:10.205 --> 00:23:17.067]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial, antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:23:17.207 --> 00:23:22.468]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[00:23:22.568 --> 00:23:23.408]  We're good to go!
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.181]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[00:23:53.201 --> 00:24:07.124]  That number again, 888-212-8871 for the most powerful natural antimicrobial... The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:07.804 --> 00:24:10.085]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:15.109 --> 00:24:16.009]  Alright, I digress.
[00:24:16.049 --> 00:24:20.031]  We've got the Ron Paul campaign popping in to talk about strategy in the debates.
[00:24:20.051 --> 00:24:20.991]  We've got a bunch of clips.
[00:24:21.412 --> 00:24:23.933]  I do want to walk through this secret amnesty bill.
[00:24:24.933 --> 00:24:25.513]  Everything's done.
[00:24:25.533 --> 00:24:26.614]  We're handing your roads over.
[00:24:26.714 --> 00:24:27.274]  It's secret.
[00:24:27.634 --> 00:24:28.915]  Even your government can't know.
[00:24:28.935 --> 00:24:34.777]  Again, the agencies run things now because they directly interlock in with the corporations.
[00:24:35.577 --> 00:24:40.159]  It's just like last year in Banff, Canada, when the Security and Prosperity Partnership met.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.980]  It was the heads of the Mexican, Canadian, and U.S.
[00:24:43.361 --> 00:24:43.961]  agencies
[00:24:44.665 --> 00:24:51.710]  The different bureaucracies meeting with the Fortune 500 leaders who in the minutes were giving the orders.
[00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:53.671]  This is how you set this up.
[00:24:53.711 --> 00:24:54.812]  This is how you set that up.
[00:24:55.332 --> 00:24:59.535]  The corporations have openly become the government and they're not free market.
[00:25:00.056 --> 00:25:01.256]  Let's go ahead and start with this.
[00:25:01.276 --> 00:25:06.280]  We'll play out the rest of it before we get Ron Paul's communications director on with us in the next segment.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:11.864]  Here's Ron Paul coming outside because the cameras weren't allowed in to the event until
[00:25:14.525 --> 00:25:19.930]  And then later they finally capitulated again because of complaints by the local media, not because of Ron Paul.
[00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:22.572]  But here he is doing the press conference outside.
[00:25:24.874 --> 00:25:30.459]  Congressman Paul, can you speak as you have in the past to the New World Order's plan for a one world government?
[00:25:30.499 --> 00:25:31.240]  Will they succeed?
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:36.864]  Will they succeed if we don't do something about it?
[00:25:44.555 --> 00:25:45.156]  I'll go first.
[00:25:45.196 --> 00:25:46.837]  Why should he be the next president of the United States?
[00:25:46.877 --> 00:25:51.921]  Because I think the country is ready for a president that will reduce the size and scope of government.
[00:25:51.961 --> 00:25:59.807]  You've had some positions that are not exactly mainstream, with drugs and marijuana, drugs.
[00:26:00.147 --> 00:26:02.909]  Describe for the people what your positions on those drugs are.
[00:26:02.929 --> 00:26:09.834]  Well, I think so often these positions that are not mainstream is determined by people other than the people.
[00:26:10.054 --> 00:26:13.137]  When the people have their word, maybe they're more mainstream.
[00:26:13.157 --> 00:26:13.677]  You know, they say
[00:26:14.233 --> 00:26:17.496]  Everybody endorses the war, but maybe mainstream America doesn't endorse it.
[00:26:17.516 --> 00:26:18.737]  Do you think marijuana should be legal?
[00:26:19.178 --> 00:26:23.001]  Well, I think the states should deal with that issue, like they do with alcohol.
[00:26:23.061 --> 00:26:24.362]  I think the federal government should be out of it.
[00:26:24.722 --> 00:26:25.984]  What about a tragedy?
[00:26:26.184 --> 00:26:27.865]  Somebody dying with cancer.
[00:26:28.145 --> 00:26:30.968]  Not even allowed to take a marijuana that might make them more comfortable.
[00:26:31.328 --> 00:26:37.334]  The states legalize it, and the federal government comes in and puts people in jail when they're dying.
[00:26:37.794 --> 00:26:39.976]  I mean, and then they call it compassionate conservatism?
[00:26:40.857 --> 00:26:40.997]  No.
[00:26:41.869 --> 00:26:44.750]  Drugs like this, alcohol is a deadly, deadly drug.
[00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:46.751]  They tried prohibition, it was a total failure.
[00:26:47.372 --> 00:26:49.433]  And I think the state should handle it.
[00:26:49.753 --> 00:26:50.994]  Children should be protected.
[00:26:51.074 --> 00:26:53.675]  Can you explain what you're talking about regarding terrorism during the debates?
[00:26:54.715 --> 00:26:57.277]  Well, it might take more than a sound bite for that.
[00:26:57.717 --> 00:27:03.540]  What I'm saying is that when it comes to terrorism, our policies contribute to it.
[00:27:04.429 --> 00:27:12.452]  And they like to turn that around and say, well, Ron Paul is saying that the American people deserve it and cause the problem.
[00:27:12.772 --> 00:27:13.072]  No.
[00:27:13.652 --> 00:27:21.334]  Neocon philosophy, which is that of foreign policy intervention, contributes because it causes anti-Americanism.
[00:27:21.774 --> 00:27:22.375]  I'm an American.
[00:27:22.435 --> 00:27:23.075]  You're an American.
[00:27:23.435 --> 00:27:26.436]  In no way did I say that you and I were the cause of it.
[00:27:26.876 --> 00:27:35.601]  They turn that around when they feel trapped and they don't know how to answer the philosophic position of non-intervention of the Constitution and why we go to war without a declaration.
[00:27:35.621 --> 00:27:41.565]  So they have to turn around and say, oh, he doesn't like the troops, or he's un-American, or he said we deserved it.
[00:27:41.845 --> 00:27:45.207]  That's just a political ploy because they don't have a philosophic answer to a problem.
[00:27:55.888 --> 00:27:56.088]  No!
[00:27:56.168 --> 00:27:58.210]  You have to understand terror.
[00:27:58.551 --> 00:28:00.092]  Terror is a tactic.
[00:28:00.132 --> 00:28:01.594]  There's no war on terror.
[00:28:01.834 --> 00:28:05.137]  That's like declaring war against criminals.
[00:28:05.678 --> 00:28:07.660]  McVeigh was a terrorist.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.002]  Have we declared war against every terrorist in the world?
[00:28:10.363 --> 00:28:11.504]  No, we should go after our enemies.
[00:28:11.824 --> 00:28:14.367]  But we have done precisely the opposite of that.
[00:28:14.747 --> 00:28:15.027]  Here we go.
[00:28:16.028 --> 00:28:18.949]  I voted for the support of going after Osama Bin Laden.
[00:28:19.069 --> 00:28:20.489]  He was in Afghanistan.
[00:28:20.889 --> 00:28:21.609]  We didn't fight.
[00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:22.410]  We let him go.
[00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:23.650]  We didn't fight Tora Bora.
[00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.151]  We allowed him to go into Pakistan.
[00:28:26.271 --> 00:28:27.411]  He's in Pakistan.
[00:28:27.671 --> 00:28:31.512]  They have a nuclear weapon and they're our bosom buddies and we subsidize them.
[00:28:31.612 --> 00:28:34.853]  And then we go off and fight a war that was undeclared and there was no Al Qaeda.
[00:28:35.413 --> 00:28:46.699]  That type of policy doesn't make any sense, because what we have to do is protect the American people, but we have to know and understand our enemies, and just not pretend that if we just go off starting new wars for other reasons.
[00:28:46.959 --> 00:28:51.601]  The war had been planned in Iraq many, many years before it happened.
[00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:57.184]  Matter of fact, the declaration of war, the essential declaration, was the Iraqi Liberation Act in 1988.
[00:28:57.604 --> 00:29:01.626]  That was when the Congress voted on a bill that said we will have regime change.
[00:29:02.046 --> 00:29:05.827]  And unfortunately, very similar resolutions have been passed already in Iran.
[00:29:06.187 --> 00:29:10.809]  If anything, I would like to make sure that we don't needlessly go to war against Iran.
[00:29:23.346 --> 00:29:28.747]  Since the declaration of war on Iraq, what spurred a lot of hatred towards the United States?
[00:29:28.827 --> 00:29:29.387]  No, no.
[00:29:29.607 --> 00:29:34.228]  The antagonism... We're going to come back and Aaron gets his question in.
[00:29:34.248 --> 00:29:37.109]  Aaron Dykes reporting for Infowars.com.
[00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:40.650]  You can watch the video of this and more in the third hour today.
[00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:44.571]  We're going to play his 18-minute speech from inside the facility.
[00:29:44.591 --> 00:29:47.191]  It's called free speech.
[00:29:47.431 --> 00:29:49.812]  It's called America, state of Texas.
[00:29:49.852 --> 00:29:50.872]  We'll play whatever we want.
[00:29:51.465 --> 00:29:54.469]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:58.073]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:33:12.268 --> 00:33:16.910]  We've got the head of Congressman Ron Paul's campaign coming on in the middle of the show Thursday.
[00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:22.152]  Then next Tuesday we're scheduled to have Congressman Ron Paul on when he's back in Texas.
[00:33:23.672 --> 00:33:25.273]  He is obviously up there in D.C.
[00:33:25.313 --> 00:33:25.873]  doing battle.
[00:33:25.913 --> 00:33:30.715]  Coming up later we're going to air the Congressman on CNN's Sunday edition last night.
[00:33:30.735 --> 00:33:38.218]  We're also going to air the second half of the press conference that we covered when he was here in Austin, Texas.
[00:33:40.396 --> 00:33:49.362]  on Saturday where he gets into the New World Order and how to stop it and what's happening to the dollar and the imploding American Empire and what the elites are up to.
[00:33:51.424 --> 00:34:06.654]  But I wanted to air just a minute or two of last week's, last Friday's Bill Maher, his program, and then go to our guest Jesse Benton, the Head of Communications, Communications Director for the Ron Paul
[00:34:07.429 --> 00:34:11.713]  Let me show you a little clip of what I think is the essence of what went on in that debate.
[00:34:11.733 --> 00:34:13.715]  The Republican Presidential Candidates Debate.
[00:34:31.653 --> 00:34:34.074]  There is a global jihadist effort.
[00:34:34.114 --> 00:34:35.155]  They want to follow us home.
[00:34:35.455 --> 00:34:37.096]  They're coming from countries that want to kill us.
[00:34:37.116 --> 00:34:38.837]  These people do want to follow us here.
[00:34:39.057 --> 00:34:40.938]  Radical Islamic extremism.
[00:34:40.978 --> 00:34:42.199]  They have followed us here.
[00:34:42.459 --> 00:34:43.800]  Those terrorists are going to attack.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.281]  We know there's going to be another attack.
[00:34:45.401 --> 00:34:46.401]  I want them in Guantanamo.
[00:34:46.421 --> 00:34:47.182]  Let's execute.
[00:34:47.222 --> 00:34:48.382]  We've got a double Guantanamo.
[00:34:48.582 --> 00:34:49.763]  Let's use the word murder.
[00:34:49.863 --> 00:34:51.884]  Enhanced interrogation techniques.
[00:34:51.904 --> 00:34:53.345]  Very high pressure techniques.
[00:34:53.505 --> 00:34:54.105]  Waterboarding.
[00:34:54.145 --> 00:34:54.386]  Chaos.
[00:34:54.406 --> 00:34:54.926]  Torture.
[00:34:55.026 --> 00:34:56.447]  I'm looking for Jack Fowler.
[00:34:56.467 --> 00:34:56.767]  Torture.
[00:34:56.807 --> 00:34:57.407]  Torture.
[00:34:57.447 --> 00:34:57.807]  Torture.
[00:34:57.847 --> 00:34:58.528]  Torture people.
[00:34:59.028 --> 00:35:03.830]  There's a strong tradition of being anti-war in the Republican Party.
[00:35:05.211 --> 00:35:18.116]  Okay, that last guy is Ron Paul, who I mentioned before.
[00:35:19.258 --> 00:35:20.038]  My new hero.
[00:35:20.058 --> 00:35:21.299]  We had him on a couple of weeks ago.
[00:35:21.339 --> 00:35:22.299]  I want to have him on again.
[00:35:22.359 --> 00:35:23.440]  I think he's great.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:30.283]  And what is so sad to me about what's going on in America is that this guy is saying truth.
[00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:34.910]  He's saying something is true, and they're treating him like a crazy person.
[00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:37.070]  He's not saying we asked for it.
[00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:41.611]  What he's saying is, they hate us because we're over there, we're meddling in their affairs.
[00:35:41.671 --> 00:35:46.472]  How would we like it if China was occupying the Gulf of Mexico?
[00:35:46.852 --> 00:35:51.313]  He could have mangled his words a little less, but I know that he's been misinterpreted.
[00:35:51.673 --> 00:35:58.375]  But you know, I find it outrageous that there are Republican officials who say you should be excluded from the other debates because of what he said.
[00:35:59.016 --> 00:36:04.461]  Look, we have a problem... And that's a big Wall Street Journal mainline conservative saying that.
[00:36:05.041 --> 00:36:11.126]  We got the word Thursday morning on the Associated Press that the head of the Republican Party in Michigan had called for it.
[00:36:11.507 --> 00:36:13.588]  Malkin had called for it the day before.
[00:36:13.949 --> 00:36:20.094]  Michelle Malkin, Fox contributor and analyst, if you can call her that, who writes books about putting people, Americans, in camps.
[00:36:20.334 --> 00:36:21.715]  She even writes books titled that.
[00:36:22.436 --> 00:36:23.497]  And just amazing.
[00:36:23.577 --> 00:36:24.718]  And here's the bottom line.
[00:36:27.228 --> 00:36:36.450]  When we played part of that press conference and local Fox was asking Congressman Ron Paul, well the majority of Americans are against you on your marijuana policy.
[00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:38.511]  The majority of Americans are against you on the war.
[00:36:39.171 --> 00:36:40.391]  Ron Paul said, no they're not.
[00:36:40.431 --> 00:36:43.192]  The polls show 75% are against the war.
[00:36:43.732 --> 00:36:46.932]  And over 80% are for drug decriminalization.
[00:36:47.793 --> 00:36:48.873]  By the way, he's a medical doctor.
[00:36:48.893 --> 00:36:49.633]  He can speak to that.
[00:36:50.262 --> 00:36:52.945]  And the states have voted to decriminalize it.
[00:36:53.445 --> 00:36:54.966]  In what, is it like 20-something states?
[00:36:55.347 --> 00:36:58.930]  And the feds don't care and they do imprison people on chemotherapy.
[00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:01.853]  And marijuana does help them hold their food down and live.
[00:37:02.694 --> 00:37:05.436]  That's the biggest problem is you can't eat when you're on the chemo and you get weak.
[00:37:07.698 --> 00:37:12.883]  So see, they take it out of context and they say that Ron Paul doesn't have the majority view and that Ron Paul isn't popular.
[00:37:13.123 --> 00:37:14.004]  He is popular.
[00:37:14.818 --> 00:37:16.559]  Now, he's never changed his ideas.
[00:37:16.619 --> 00:37:18.460]  His ideas weren't popular 10, 20 years ago.
[00:37:18.741 --> 00:37:19.761]  They are popular now!
[00:37:19.781 --> 00:37:26.566]  Alright, I'm going to shut up and go to the Communications Director, Jesse Benton, who we're really honored to have on with us here.
[00:37:26.606 --> 00:37:29.287]  He's with the Ron Paul 2008 Presidential Campaign.
[00:37:29.588 --> 00:37:30.548]  Jesse, thanks for the time.
[00:37:30.948 --> 00:37:32.269]  Oh, Alex, thanks so much for having me on.
[00:37:32.289 --> 00:37:33.190]  I appreciate it very much.
[00:37:34.465 --> 00:37:45.048]  I think it backfired on them to try to ban him, to try to demonize him, but before that to always target him and try to gang up on him when he was in the Fox debate.
[00:37:45.168 --> 00:37:49.810]  I think that this took him from being a long shot to being a real contender.
[00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:51.570]  Jesse Benton, do you concur?
[00:37:52.151 --> 00:38:00.153]  What's the strategy right now inside the campaign and what can we do as the grassroots to get behind the campaign even more and make sure this happens?
[00:38:00.653 --> 00:38:02.174]  Well, I absolutely concur.
[00:38:02.754 --> 00:38:05.896]  I thank Rudolph Giuliani sincerely from the bottom of my heart.
[00:38:07.357 --> 00:38:12.940]  By engaging Ron, he elevated Ron up to the status of a top-tier contender.
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:20.564]  And I tell you, Ron, we've been snipping at his heels, at the heels of these other supposed top ten, top three contenders for a while now.
[00:38:21.205 --> 00:38:22.886]  And I think they were starting to take notice.
[00:38:23.206 --> 00:38:28.629]  And there was some real inherent bias, I think, in the questioning and the format of the Fox News debate.
[00:38:29.481 --> 00:38:38.978]  And, uh, you know, Rudolph Giuliani really tried to tee off and smack Ron down, but by doing so, by engaging, first of all, he was acknowledging that Ron is a viable threat.
[00:38:39.848 --> 00:38:46.330]  A viable candidate and a real threat to the Giuliani campaign and the other status quo establishment candidates.
[00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:51.252]  And then he also really rose up Ron Paul's status.
[00:38:51.292 --> 00:38:52.492]  People are talking about Ron.
[00:38:52.532 --> 00:38:56.694]  Ron's gotten tons of TV opportunities, more radio opportunities than we can handle.
[00:38:57.034 --> 00:38:57.754]  He's in print.
[00:38:57.794 --> 00:39:00.395]  He's even more blogged about and talked about on the internet.
[00:39:00.775 --> 00:39:04.459]  And it's because of this exchange with Rudy Giuliani.
[00:39:04.539 --> 00:39:12.868]  And I think people are really starting, that before might have had their ears closed, are starting to hear the truth about our foreign policy and about non-interventionism.
[00:39:12.988 --> 00:39:15.350]  And it's becoming more and more attractive to them.
[00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:20.676]  And again, I would just like to thank Rudy Giuliani for doing this for us.
[00:39:21.036 --> 00:39:22.236]  Now, that was part one.
[00:39:22.316 --> 00:39:23.197]  Then they tried.
[00:39:23.797 --> 00:39:28.758]  Mr. Steele, the head of GOPAC and others, and Fox analysts shed banning from the debate.
[00:39:29.018 --> 00:39:35.080]  Then the head of one of the most important Republican parties in the country, the head of the Michigan party, said, let's ban him.
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.480]  He was going to circulate a petition.
[00:39:37.361 --> 00:39:45.963]  It seems to have exploded with Giuliani attacking the congressman, but it seems to have even gotten more of a push when they tried to ban him.
[00:39:47.132 --> 00:39:47.413]  Sure.
[00:39:48.073 --> 00:39:52.617]  Solid news as you bring up the chair of the Michigan GOP.
[00:39:53.618 --> 00:39:54.639]  We're seething a little bit.
[00:39:55.119 --> 00:39:58.823]  I don't know exactly what his ties are, but it seems like he's a pro-Giuliani candidate.
[00:39:58.843 --> 00:40:05.989]  Decided to go back to Michigan and announced that he was going to circulate a petition to ban Ron from further GOP debates.
[00:40:06.451 --> 00:40:10.732]  He was doing this unilaterally without even consulting the rest of his elected party officials.
[00:40:11.332 --> 00:40:16.913]  So he was really kind of smacked down both by other Michigan GOP officials and by the public.
[00:40:17.334 --> 00:40:21.314]  His phone number was in public record because he's a public official.
[00:40:21.614 --> 00:40:26.116]  He was swamped with so many calls and emails at their office, literally shut down his BlackBerry crash.
[00:40:26.516 --> 00:40:32.217]  And we have recordings of people up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com where they called up
[00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:40.140]  To the RNC, who got calls as well, and that's why we put the calls there, so they would smack him down and other factions in the party.
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.281]  And they said they were getting over a hundred calls a minute.
[00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:47.643]  I mean, that shows incredible support for the Congressman, doesn't it, Jesse Benton?
[00:40:47.863 --> 00:40:48.924]  I think it absolutely does.
[00:40:49.304 --> 00:40:51.084]  It shows incredible support for the Congressman.
[00:40:51.365 --> 00:40:55.806]  It also shows incredible support for the American people for something a little different.
[00:40:55.886 --> 00:41:02.349]  You know, I think a lot of people that hadn't heard of Ron Paul before, now they stood up and they took notice and said, hey, we kind of like what we're hearing.
[00:41:02.629 --> 00:41:03.631]  We'd like to hear some more.
[00:41:03.911 --> 00:41:17.832]  We recognize that we don't have the nationwide name recognition of John McCain or Rudy Giuliani, but as people hear Ron's messages and they discover Ron's message of limited government, personal freedom, and international non-interventionism, they like what they're hearing.
[00:41:18.248 --> 00:41:20.669]  And now they're opening up their ears and they're more receptive to it.
[00:41:20.689 --> 00:41:23.571]  And we think our nation, I mean, our message is really going to resonate.
[00:41:23.871 --> 00:41:28.674]  Expanding on that, I watch the Yahoo Top Ten search terms.
[00:41:28.694 --> 00:41:31.815]  I also watch the Google Top Ten search terms.
[00:41:32.516 --> 00:41:36.238]  And politicians are almost never in those Top Ten.
[00:41:36.278 --> 00:41:37.939]  And I mean British Prime Ministers,
[00:41:38.619 --> 00:41:42.123]  I mean, French Presidents, American Presidents are not normally in the top ten.
[00:41:42.544 --> 00:41:47.249]  Ron Paul, last Wednesday, won as high as number eight in the Yahoo Top Ten.
[00:41:47.529 --> 00:41:51.613]  He won as high as number five in the Google Top Ten by Friday.
[00:41:51.633 --> 00:41:59.302]  That right there shows just unbelievable viral spread of the campaign's name.
[00:41:59.883 --> 00:42:00.323]  I agree.
[00:42:00.384 --> 00:42:08.540]  And there's also another site called technoraddy.com, which is a search engine designed specifically to search blogs in the blogosphere.
[00:42:09.111 --> 00:42:32.025]  And Ron has been the number one search term on Technorati for nearly two weeks now, and that is a really powerful indication that there really is a groundswell of American people that are looking for alternate news, alternate reporting on Ron Paul, trying to bypass the mainstream media and see what other people are putting out there on the blogs and trying to get more direct contact, direct information on Ron through the blogosphere.
[00:42:32.045 --> 00:42:33.526]  We think that's incredibly positive.
[00:42:33.766 --> 00:42:42.834]  Now, there were two press reports yesterday, one by a big international group that looks at polls out of California, and they just officially put the stamp on what we had already seen.
[00:42:43.174 --> 00:42:54.904]  From Texas to Ohio to New Hampshire, the big scientific polls aren't even including the congressman in the roster of candidates, so then they can go out and report that he isn't showing up in the polls.
[00:42:55.204 --> 00:43:01.930]  Well, yeah, if they won't let him on the field, if they won't let him into the race, that's like saying somebody is in a contender in the Daytona.
[00:43:02.814 --> 00:43:10.256]  You know, 500, even though they've gotten the poll position in the qualifying laps, they're just not letting him in.
[00:43:10.837 --> 00:43:14.678]  So how important is it now to stop that censorship of the congressman?
[00:43:15.038 --> 00:43:16.818]  Well, he is being included more and more.
[00:43:16.838 --> 00:43:18.139]  I saw that same report.
[00:43:18.159 --> 00:43:25.081]  There was something like 31 nationwide polls had been taken that were, you know, considered serious, and Ron Paul had only been included in six.
[00:43:25.621 --> 00:43:32.106]  He did score 3% in the most recent Gallup poll taken on May 16th, the day after the South Carolina debate.
[00:43:32.466 --> 00:43:33.567]  So that puts him real strong.
[00:43:33.607 --> 00:43:36.729]  That puts him above all the other quote-unquote second tier candidates.
[00:43:36.789 --> 00:43:41.993]  I was about to say McCain is now, in many polls that are given, being supplanted by Paul.
[00:43:43.336 --> 00:43:47.419]  I haven't seen polls saying that, but I will say this about polls in general at this point.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:50.602]  I think they're a little silly to be focusing on them so, so strongly.
[00:43:50.662 --> 00:43:53.064]  I mean, polls at this point are about name recognition.
[00:43:53.184 --> 00:44:02.492]  But I agree, but I mean, when he shows up and gets 94% of the vote in a 10-way race on MSNBC, they can claim it isn't scientific, but it is IP-identified.
[00:44:02.732 --> 00:44:04.053]  He did one vote per person.
[00:44:04.314 --> 00:44:05.395]  I think we ought to trumpet that.
[00:44:05.595 --> 00:44:09.498]  And I think when he gets second place in a 10-way race on Fox, we ought to trumpet that.
[00:44:09.738 --> 00:44:10.359]  And I think that...
[00:44:10.899 --> 00:44:12.000]  I think there is some credibility there.
[00:44:12.401 --> 00:44:14.603]  We have, and I think there is plenty of credibility.
[00:44:14.883 --> 00:44:21.349]  You know, people can try to shoot that down all they want, but the fact that, you know, we can get, and we don't get, we don't even really encourage this.
[00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:25.393]  We're not trying to encourage people to spam or even really vote these things.
[00:44:25.413 --> 00:44:26.975]  These are people acting on their own.
[00:44:27.055 --> 00:44:35.323]  If, you know, we've got thousands of people, thousands of more people than Rudy Giuliani or John McCain text messaging in to support Ron Paul, that's just a sign of his strength.
[00:44:35.703 --> 00:44:38.284]  We're not going to apologize for the fact that... Exactly!
[00:44:38.404 --> 00:44:42.746]  As if Giuliani and all these other people don't actually have the campaigns texting.
[00:44:42.986 --> 00:44:44.687]  It shows real grassroots support.
[00:44:44.727 --> 00:44:46.727]  I mean, this is how I... Oh, they sure did.
[00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:49.308]  Their campaigns all sent out emails.
[00:44:49.328 --> 00:44:52.430]  Their entire email was urging them to text messaging to vote for their candidate.
[00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:53.130]  We didn't do that.
[00:44:54.003 --> 00:44:54.443]  Exactly.
[00:44:54.463 --> 00:44:55.384]  In fact, I've seen those.
[00:44:55.424 --> 00:44:57.926]  I've been sent those Giuliani campaign emails.
[00:44:58.186 --> 00:45:05.011]  So, here is Fox News accusing the Ron Paul 2008 presidential campaign of what Giuliani and others are actually doing.
[00:45:05.571 --> 00:45:06.012]  Yeah, sure.
[00:45:06.032 --> 00:45:08.674]  It's just that these things just don't hold any water, too.
[00:45:09.014 --> 00:45:12.176]  Accusing us of spamming with, you know, a few hundred supporters.
[00:45:12.216 --> 00:45:13.077]  That's just ridiculous.
[00:45:13.117 --> 00:45:14.578]  These polls are IP protected.
[00:45:15.138 --> 00:45:18.501]  The Fox News text poll was one vote per telephone number.
[00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:20.282]  So, those things just don't hold any water.
[00:45:20.322 --> 00:45:21.683]  We've heard these kind of arguments before.
[00:45:22.823 --> 00:45:23.404]  Absolutely.
[00:45:23.424 --> 00:45:27.213]  We need to get an article out on that to get out ahead of that so the public can be educated.
[00:45:27.775 --> 00:45:28.998]  Just two more questions.
[00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:43.481]  What do you think the next tactic or strategy is going to be by not just the RNC, but the Democrats as well, as Ron Paul becomes more and more popular as he rides this wave, which only shows that it's going to get bigger?
[00:45:44.622 --> 00:45:46.703]  What do you see their tactics as being?
[00:45:47.084 --> 00:45:48.865]  Trying to dredge up disinfo?
[00:45:48.945 --> 00:45:50.286]  Trying to slander him?
[00:45:50.306 --> 00:45:56.071]  I mean, I'm looking for something like that, them cooking up, because they are scared of him, some type of controversy.
[00:45:56.812 --> 00:45:58.514]  That's A, but I want to get your take on it.
[00:45:58.895 --> 00:46:04.382]  B, just continual demonization or will they do the smart thing and start trying to ignore him again?
[00:46:06.005 --> 00:46:08.468]  I don't think at this point that Ron can really be ignored.
[00:46:08.508 --> 00:46:12.534]  I think that his name is too far out there and he's caught too much attention.
[00:46:13.227 --> 00:46:18.970]  I think, well, I can see right now that some of the neoconservatives are trying to smear Ron as being anti-semitic.
[00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:27.693]  They say, you know, he doesn't support, you know, our subsidies of Israel, he doesn't support foreign aid to Israel, and therefore he's anti-semitic.
[00:46:27.953 --> 00:46:30.955]  Which is just, it's just, it's just crap, quite frankly.
[00:46:31.475 --> 00:46:33.776]  You know, Ron doesn't support foreign aid to any country.
[00:46:34.316 --> 00:46:35.837]  If you look at really... But it is!
[00:46:35.877 --> 00:46:38.199]  But I mean, excuse me, you're right, sir, it is crap.
[00:46:38.539 --> 00:46:46.945]  Ron Paul is against any of these subsidies and I am sick of these different lobbies playing the race card for no reason.
[00:46:47.185 --> 00:46:47.646]  Go ahead.
[00:46:47.726 --> 00:46:52.509]  You know, Ron has been one of the strongest advocates in Congress of Israel's right to defend its sovereignty.
[00:46:52.969 --> 00:46:59.794]  So many times this aid is wrought with strings that say, you know, you can't protect your borders if you're invaded.
[00:46:59.854 --> 00:47:03.697]  Ron says, hey, I don't want to subsidize you, but I also say you can protect your borders if you're invaded.
[00:47:04.204 --> 00:47:09.060]  And, you know, I would argue that Ron is more pro-Israel than so many of these people that vote for these foreign subsidies.
[00:47:09.798 --> 00:47:11.298]  Well, I think that's going to backfire, too.
[00:47:11.378 --> 00:47:17.600]  I have seen that, where they're trying to claim he's anti-Semitic because he's against sending four-plus billion dollars a year to Israel.
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:22.341]  That's what they're trying to say, and that just doesn't fit with Ron's record, doesn't fit with reality.
[00:47:22.581 --> 00:47:25.521]  Well, there's the smear right there, so clearly that's going to be tried.
[00:47:25.541 --> 00:47:30.102]  They're going to try to dredge up 15-year-old stuff that somebody else wrote, too, about another subject.
[00:47:30.122 --> 00:47:37.564]  But folks, preemptively, need to be aware that there are going to be these smears, and we need to jump on it immediately if they try it.
[00:47:38.124 --> 00:47:38.784]  I think so.
[00:47:39.424 --> 00:47:40.866]  How do we support the campaign?
[00:47:40.986 --> 00:47:45.590]  Obviously, we need to give out the phone number, the website, RonPaul2008.com.
[00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:46.811]  How do we donate?
[00:47:46.851 --> 00:47:47.652]  How do we support?
[00:47:47.912 --> 00:47:48.993]  How do we get yard signs?
[00:47:49.033 --> 00:47:50.054]  How do we get bumper stickers?
[00:47:50.274 --> 00:47:53.317]  Do we go to the Ron Paul store and buy that stuff?
[00:47:53.377 --> 00:47:54.418]  It's pretty much at cost.
[00:47:54.718 --> 00:47:55.519]  How do we support you?
[00:47:55.859 --> 00:47:57.240]  Three things I would stress right now.
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:58.942]  First of all, visit RonPaul2008.com.
[00:48:00.763 --> 00:48:01.844]  Join our meetup group.
[00:48:02.004 --> 00:48:06.086]  That will put you in touch with other people in your area that are Ron Paul supporters.
[00:48:06.426 --> 00:48:14.310]  Be able to start organizing and be able to have groups ready on the ground from the National Campaign Office when it's time to plug into your area, into your state.
[00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:25.375]  Second of all, I would encourage you to continue to write letters to your local newspapers, letters to the editor, talking about Ron, not necessarily demanding that they cover him.
[00:48:25.675 --> 00:48:27.996]  Because they've already gotten that message.
[00:48:28.056 --> 00:48:34.280]  Talk about Ron's message of freedom, and talk about how people support non-interventionist foreign policy and limited government.
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:39.983]  And then finally, our YouTube channel has been widely successful, and we think it's one of the most dynamic tools out there.
[00:48:40.043 --> 00:48:41.724]  Web 2.0 to promote a candidate.
[00:48:42.005 --> 00:48:45.446]  We have some really popular videos right now that have been circulating virally.
[00:48:45.507 --> 00:48:49.009]  People, 100,000 views in just two and a half, three days.
[00:48:49.329 --> 00:48:53.051]  Encourage people to watch all those videos and forward them on to your friends and your family.
[00:48:53.471 --> 00:48:56.293]  Encourage them to watch them and then forward them on themselves.
[00:48:56.653 --> 00:48:58.174]  We would like to see these things go viral.
[00:48:58.194 --> 00:49:01.215]  We'd like to see millions of people seeing Ron Paul's YouTube videos.
[00:49:01.235 --> 00:49:04.977]  We think they're really potent and we think that they're just an incredible tool.
[00:49:05.938 --> 00:49:06.278]  I agree.
[00:49:06.298 --> 00:49:11.361]  In fact, we've got the speech he gave up on PrisonPlanet.tv Saturday night right now.
[00:49:11.681 --> 00:49:18.325]  We also have the entire press conference he gave that we uploaded to YouTube on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:49:18.345 --> 00:49:20.846]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:49:21.166 --> 00:49:22.207]  Get those YouTube videos.
[00:49:22.227 --> 00:49:22.527]  I think so.
[00:49:52.717 --> 00:49:53.978]  We don't have a toll-free telephone number.
[00:49:53.998 --> 00:49:59.563]  We've got www.ronpaul2008.com.
[00:50:00.063 --> 00:50:00.264]  2008.com.
[00:50:00.304 --> 00:50:01.545]  And I don't have the number in front of me.
[00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:02.426]  I've given it out before.
[00:50:02.906 --> 00:50:04.247]  I'm putting you on the spot here, Jesse.
[00:50:04.287 --> 00:50:05.588]  If not, I can get it out for the break and give it.
[00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:07.871]  Do you have the phone number for folks to call to donate?
[00:50:08.771 --> 00:50:09.212]  No, I'm sorry.
[00:50:09.232 --> 00:50:10.693]  I sure don't, off the top of my head.
[00:50:10.753 --> 00:50:14.857]  But there is a good online form right there on the website.
[00:50:15.177 --> 00:50:15.778]  Absolutely.
[00:50:15.818 --> 00:50:18.200]  So, RonPaul2008.com.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:26.286]  We'll be having the campaign head on Thursday, and we're scheduled, as they say across the pond, to have Congressman Ron Paul on next Tuesday.
[00:50:26.626 --> 00:50:29.489]  And Jesse Benton, I know you've been an extremely busy man.
[00:50:29.509 --> 00:50:31.791]  I want to thank you for all your time and the work you're doing.
[00:50:32.271 --> 00:50:32.731]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:50:32.771 --> 00:50:33.332]  Great to be with you.
[00:50:33.492 --> 00:50:36.274]  Are we going to see Ron Paul on any more national TV in the next few days?
[00:50:36.775 --> 00:50:40.618]  Actually, he will be on Real Time with Bill Maher this Friday on HBO.
[00:50:41.534 --> 00:50:42.215]  Fantastic.
[00:50:42.275 --> 00:50:42.875]  Good job.
[00:50:43.135 --> 00:50:44.276]  Thank you so much, Jesse.
[00:50:44.516 --> 00:50:44.836]  Thank you.
[00:50:45.416 --> 00:50:45.957]  God bless.
[00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:48.798]  Alright, RonPaul2008.com.
[00:50:48.859 --> 00:50:52.100]  I'll turn on my computer here in front of me, and I will give you the phone number.
[00:50:53.581 --> 00:50:54.762]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:54.782 --> 00:50:59.785]  We'll play the rest of the press conference, take your calls, get into the immigration amnesty that's coming up today.
[00:51:04.554 --> 00:51:07.738]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.098 --> 00:51:10.040]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:18.009]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.726 --> 00:51:25.788]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.169 --> 00:51:37.612]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.912 --> 00:51:41.394]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.854 --> 00:51:43.794]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.135 --> 00:51:47.976]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:51:48.576 --> 00:51:56.022]  Get your copy today on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:52:01.497 --> 00:52:04.679]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:04.699 --> 00:52:08.742]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:08.882 --> 00:52:11.444]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:11.504 --> 00:52:13.825]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:14.026 --> 00:52:22.451]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:22.531 --> 00:52:23.852]  The Brookie light is different.
[00:52:23.972 --> 00:52:27.995]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:27.995 --> 00:52:28.495]  We're good to go!
[00:52:48.404 --> 00:52:51.447]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.
[00:52:51.467 --> 00:52:53.309]  888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:53.329 --> 00:52:54.050]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:01.252 --> 00:53:02.953]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:03.193 --> 00:53:06.895]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:07.215 --> 00:53:16.140]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:21.163]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.403 --> 00:53:30.410]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:36.755]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.
[00:53:37.015 --> 00:53:40.057]  Turn your internet on and off with one simple switch.
[00:53:40.197 --> 00:53:43.298]  There's no software to load, and it's so easy to install.

[00:53:55.182 --> 00:54:00.224]  That's NET, the number 7, tech.com, and start protecting yourself today!
[00:54:03.704 --> 00:54:09.708]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.329 --> 00:54:13.311]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:19.375 --> 00:54:24.999]  Yeah, callers about a week ago gave us the 1-800-RON-PAUL number, but his Director of Communications just said they didn't have that.
[00:54:25.059 --> 00:54:28.842]  Now, these things move so quick you may not be aware of that, but we're going to find out if that's a good number.
[00:54:29.961 --> 00:54:31.562]  Well, we're sending people to the Tooth Fairy.
[00:54:32.302 --> 00:54:33.803]  We know this is an official number.
[00:54:33.823 --> 00:54:36.164]  It's right off RonPaul2008.com.
[00:54:36.224 --> 00:54:38.786]  Call, donate, tell them you want to organize.
[00:54:39.126 --> 00:54:46.410]  If you don't have a computer, they can give you the number to local Ron Paul campaign groups in your state or your city or town.
[00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:47.230]  It's 703-248-9115.
[00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:48.231]  Write this down.
[00:54:48.251 --> 00:54:48.291]  703-248-9115.
[00:54:59.463 --> 00:55:00.964]  And call up, donate, support.
[00:55:01.024 --> 00:55:01.985]  Tell them you want to volunteer.
[00:55:02.005 --> 00:55:04.287]  Tell them you want to buy yard signs or bumper stickers.
[00:55:04.307 --> 00:55:05.348]  They sell them at cost.
[00:55:05.908 --> 00:55:10.232]  They've got them all right there in the Ron Paul store as well on the website.
[00:55:11.553 --> 00:55:17.098]  But we've just called our office back to find out about this 1-800-RON-PAUL that we were given.
[00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:19.111]  Find out where that's going.
[00:55:19.671 --> 00:55:23.433]  But here is the number off the Ron Paul 2008 website, 703-248-9119.
[00:55:23.513 --> 00:55:39.740]  Coming up, I'm going to start the next hour, I'm going to play the rest of the Ron Paul Press Conference, we're going to take calls, cover the immigration news, the Blanket Amnesty Plan, a bunch of new developments in the North American Union, and the attempt to smokescreen that by the mainstream media.
[00:55:40.401 --> 00:55:41.761]  Key stuff in the next hour.
[00:55:42.742 --> 00:55:43.122]  Also,
[00:55:45.089 --> 00:55:52.257]  We're going to play that speech from the other night, from his Saturday night speech that has not been heard on the radio or even on the web yet.
[00:55:52.577 --> 00:55:55.861]  We just posted to PrisonPlanet.tv in the last 30 minutes.
[00:55:56.942 --> 00:55:58.784]  We'll be hearing that as well.
[00:56:00.066 --> 00:56:02.929]  Also, folks, we're trying to expand what we're doing.
[00:56:04.688 --> 00:56:12.613]  We're trying to have a bigger effect here, and send reporters out to events, and have more writers, and post more video, and make more films.
[00:56:13.053 --> 00:56:15.915]  We need support to do that, so don't forget that we need your support.
[00:56:16.395 --> 00:56:19.257]  And you support us by getting my new film, Terror Storm.
[00:56:19.317 --> 00:56:22.079]  The first edition is only available for a few more weeks.
[00:56:22.099 --> 00:56:23.240]  We're almost sold out of it.
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:25.161]  Second edition comes out in July.
[00:56:27.163 --> 00:56:31.144]  And it's selling out quick, so get your copy, first edition of Terror Storm.
[00:56:31.564 --> 00:56:36.206]  I'm sending a signed card with every copy that you order from InfoWars.com.
[00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:38.646]  You can get unsigned ones from Amazon.com.
[00:56:38.686 --> 00:56:40.387]  They're getting close to being sold out.
[00:56:40.747 --> 00:56:41.707]  So again, InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:56:41.727 --> 00:56:45.108]  Or you can simply write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:56:55.311 --> 00:57:07.037]  You can get as low as $9.95, American Freedom to Fascism, the original, directly from Aaron Russo, that way you're supporting him, at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[00:57:07.338 --> 00:57:08.858]  Loose change, second edition.
[00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:14.602]  I have the actual DVD, 9-11 Mysteries, Demolitions, Riddles in Stone.
[00:57:14.682 --> 00:57:18.904]  I mean, just, we've got a huge online video and bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:21.704 --> 00:57:24.865]  And in closing in this hour, nutrition is everything.
[00:57:24.965 --> 00:57:32.247]  And I heard everybody for a couple of years talking about Interfood, their Patriots, the owners, the nutritionists, his friends with George Humphreys and Dr. John Breeding.
[00:57:32.507 --> 00:57:33.128]  I didn't know this.
[00:57:33.628 --> 00:57:36.589]  My wife started taking it and loved it and said, you ought to get them as a sponsor.
[00:57:36.689 --> 00:57:37.289]  We did.
[00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:38.629]  I'm now taking it.
[00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:40.150]  It just annihilates hunger.
[00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.950]  Why?
[00:57:41.110 --> 00:57:43.031]  Not because there's a bunch of caffeine and stuff in it.
[00:57:43.071 --> 00:57:43.292]  No!
[00:57:43.772 --> 00:57:47.854]  Because it's all of the essential vitamins and nutrients from live sources.
[00:57:48.394 --> 00:57:53.937]  You know, the extracts of all these vegetables and plants and seaweed and plankton and everything else.
[00:57:54.297 --> 00:57:58.119]  This is the best green food I've seen at a low price and they're Patriots.
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:57:59.800]  Folks, you cannot beat it.
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:02.902]  Get InnerFood at enerfood.com.
[00:58:05.323 --> 00:58:09.585]  Or check out the banners on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and JonesReport.com.
[00:58:09.865 --> 00:58:12.146]  That's Interfood.com or the number.
[00:58:12.226 --> 00:58:13.247]  Call them right now.
[00:58:13.707 --> 00:58:15.387]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get discounts.
[00:58:15.407 --> 00:58:15.828]  866-762-9238.
[00:58:15.848 --> 00:58:15.988]  866-762-9238.
[00:58:16.148 --> 00:58:17.608]  I believe in it.
[00:58:17.869 --> 00:58:18.949]  It's awesome stuff.
[00:58:18.969 --> 00:58:19.409]  Interfood.
[00:58:19.429 --> 00:58:19.489]  866-762-9238.
[00:58:19.509 --> 00:58:19.949]  Or ENERFOOD.com.
[00:58:33.095 --> 00:58:36.717]  That's Enterfood.com or 866-762-9238.
[00:58:36.997 --> 00:58:39.498]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the second hour!
[00:58:41.519 --> 00:58:45.741]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.674 --> 00:59:02.517]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.537 --> 00:59:03.338]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.099 --> 00:59:04.979]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.999 --> 00:59:09.322]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.843 --> 00:59:13.965]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.067 --> 00:59:26.054]  My friends, we need you to get on the Capitol switchboard, the Senate switchboard especially, and call Arlen Specker and every one of those traitors, and call House members, because it's going there next.
[00:59:27.259 --> 00:59:29.901]  They're saying the President's got the deal behind closed doors.
[00:59:29.921 --> 00:59:31.443]  They're going to pass total amnesty.
[00:59:31.963 --> 00:59:37.528]  They've got the mainstream media lying, having the illegals protest it and claim it's restriction.
[00:59:37.628 --> 00:59:38.629]  It does not do that.
[00:59:39.009 --> 00:59:40.931]  We're going to expose that hoax coming up.
[00:59:41.812 --> 00:59:49.118]  Later in the show we're going to air Ron Paul's press conference he gave here Saturday and the speech that hasn't been heard yet in the third hour.
[00:59:49.158 --> 00:59:54.503]  The speech Ron Paul gave at the State of Texas building where he was having and tried to keep us from recording in there.
[00:59:57.165 --> 00:59:59.947]  Well, I don't want them to go to Hades, but we're just going to do what we want here.
[01:00:00.327 --> 01:00:01.728]  We're going to get this information out.
[01:00:02.448 --> 01:00:04.209]  And so that is coming up.
[01:00:04.229 --> 01:00:05.210]  It's called the First Amendment.
[01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:09.592]  We stand firmly on it with God's support, and ask for God's support.
[01:00:10.313 --> 01:00:11.714]  So that's coming up as well.
[01:00:11.754 --> 01:00:12.874]  Just masses of news.
[01:00:12.894 --> 01:00:14.575]  It's such an important broadcast today.
[01:00:15.476 --> 01:00:16.637]  Right now, let's go to the calls.
[01:00:16.657 --> 01:00:16.977]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:17.017 --> 01:00:27.563]  I'm going to take a gamut, a load of calls, a board of calls, and then we'll start playing the Ron Paul stuff and get into the open borders and the total amnesty.
[01:00:27.844 --> 01:00:29.244]  Paul in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:00:29.284 --> 01:00:29.665]  Go ahead.
[01:00:29.685 --> 01:00:33.087]  I just wanted to say, no more anchor babies.
[01:00:34.488 --> 01:00:37.871]  We need to pass a law of no more anchor babies so that they can't come up here.
[01:00:37.911 --> 01:00:43.895]  As long as they've got that law, no law preventing them, they're going to come up here and have children.
[01:00:44.135 --> 01:00:51.701]  I mean, who wouldn't some peasant in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Southern, Northern Mexico, who wouldn't come here with an average baby costing $12,000 now?
[01:00:53.937 --> 01:00:56.078]  My wife had complications with our first child.
[01:00:56.138 --> 01:00:57.798]  It was almost $30,000.
[01:00:58.218 --> 01:01:01.579]  Thank God I had insurance, but the 20% I had to pay almost broke me.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.440]  Five years ago, I really didn't even have that much money to pay for that.
[01:01:07.421 --> 01:01:08.921]  It's just amazing, but oh no!
[01:01:09.422 --> 01:01:14.063]  The hospitals just passed that cost on to all of us, through taxes and through cost.
[01:01:14.483 --> 01:01:21.224]  Mr. Jones, I wanted to tell you that I'm supporting... I'm supporting Congressman Ron Paul for the Republican presidential candidate for this country.
[01:01:41.843 --> 01:01:46.606]  Before we lose it entirely, I've got bumper stickers all over my van, on the back of my car.
[01:01:47.187 --> 01:01:49.708]  And I'm trying to tell people I'm writing phone numbers down.
[01:01:50.169 --> 01:01:53.191]  And bumper stickers, by the way, are very expensive.
[01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:55.112]  I didn't know until I was told.
[01:01:55.692 --> 01:01:58.654]  And campaign contributions would help with this.
[01:01:59.135 --> 01:02:02.417]  Hillary Clinton's got almost $240 million war chest.
[01:02:02.457 --> 01:02:05.079]  Now, you know, she can buy anything she wants.
[01:02:05.559 --> 01:02:07.300]  We need help to get this man in there.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.701]  If we don't, we're done.
[01:02:08.721 --> 01:02:11.063]  Hi, Harry, and I appreciate it, and good to hear from you.
[01:02:11.981 --> 01:02:12.922]  Let me be clear about this.
[01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:13.882]  I disagree with one thing.
[01:02:13.922 --> 01:02:14.683]  We're not done.
[01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:16.344]  We're never going to stop fighting.
[01:02:16.384 --> 01:02:17.344]  This is a key battle.
[01:02:17.924 --> 01:02:29.151]  Even getting him in all the debates and having him be involved in the primary, he's going to be injecting real issues and showing that all the other parties and all the other candidates are bought and paid for.
[01:02:29.171 --> 01:02:31.512]  That's a victory right there.
[01:02:31.572 --> 01:02:32.913]  He could win a primary.
[01:02:33.673 --> 01:02:34.034]  Okay?
[01:02:34.094 --> 01:02:36.895]  And then they'll... Who knows what they'll do?
[01:02:36.915 --> 01:02:38.356]  I mean, I don't think they'll let him live.
[01:02:38.982 --> 01:02:40.183]  But he's a military veteran.
[01:02:40.203 --> 01:02:40.943]  He knows what he's doing.
[01:02:41.964 --> 01:02:43.505]  So we're in this fight.
[01:02:43.866 --> 01:02:53.873]  And even if they pass the amnesty, we're going to sue the locals and protest the local businesses and we're going to get more aggressive and we're going to enforce the law and we're going to take action.
[01:02:54.333 --> 01:02:55.513]  We're never going to give up.
[01:02:55.574 --> 01:02:56.914]  This is not the end-all be-all.
[01:02:57.394 --> 01:02:58.935]  Everything doesn't write on Ron Paul.
[01:02:58.955 --> 01:03:01.355]  You know, I coined the phrase, America's last hope.
[01:03:01.696 --> 01:03:02.716]  We put that out there.
[01:03:02.796 --> 01:03:04.316]  I said, founding father material.
[01:03:04.637 --> 01:03:06.117]  That got picked up as slogans.
[01:03:06.177 --> 01:03:06.497]  Great!
[01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:07.918]  Pick my brain, folks.
[01:03:07.978 --> 01:03:10.318]  And I pick the stuff you call in with.
[01:03:10.338 --> 01:03:14.720]  A lot of the jewels I basically popularize come from you, the audience.
[01:03:15.928 --> 01:03:18.092]  And so certainly a lot of that's my fault.
[01:03:18.172 --> 01:03:24.381]  I put out this America's Last Hope thing and it's gotten caught on in this founding father material and a founding father.
[01:03:25.163 --> 01:03:26.365]  And great, let's use that.
[01:03:26.665 --> 01:03:28.107]  But he is not the last hope.
[01:03:28.147 --> 01:03:31.012]  He is a key part of our last ditch effort.
[01:03:31.986 --> 01:03:32.306]  All right.
[01:03:32.586 --> 01:03:37.407]  But yes, we did call and the office 1-800-RonPaul is their number.
[01:03:37.467 --> 01:03:42.029]  It's new and their campaign guy wasn't aware of that yet because he's so busy just scheduling interviews.
[01:03:42.049 --> 01:03:44.669]  So 1-800-RonPaul is the number or 703-248-9119 is the fax.
[01:03:44.689 --> 01:03:45.109]  9-1-1-5 is the phone.
[01:03:56.485 --> 01:04:01.931]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.332 --> 01:04:09.940]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.652 --> 01:04:17.716]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.116 --> 01:04:29.542]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.862 --> 01:04:33.524]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.804 --> 01:04:35.765]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.065 --> 01:04:39.927]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.546 --> 01:04:57.109]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:04:57.149 --> 01:04:57.650]  are located?
[01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:01.253]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:05:01.473 --> 01:05:06.177]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:05:06.457 --> 01:05:11.461]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[01:05:11.721 --> 01:05:12.301]  We're good to go.
[01:05:31.491 --> 01:05:32.372]  We're good to go.
[01:05:54.972 --> 01:05:56.953]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer.
[01:05:57.433 --> 01:06:00.094]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[01:06:00.854 --> 01:06:01.994]  For a while anyway.
[01:06:02.495 --> 01:06:05.676]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[01:06:06.276 --> 01:06:08.617]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[01:06:08.917 --> 01:06:12.418]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:06:12.778 --> 01:06:15.039]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:06:15.579 --> 01:06:16.299]  What's the name again?
[01:06:16.319 --> 01:06:17.680]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:18.900]  It's CalX.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.201]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:06:21.756 --> 01:06:23.417]  What makes Kallax Ointment so different?
[01:06:23.637 --> 01:06:31.960]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:06:32.981 --> 01:06:37.543]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Kallax Ointment.
[01:06:37.763 --> 01:06:46.866]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:06:47.567 --> 01:06:48.687]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[01:06:48.747 --> 01:06:49.407]  I'll be right back.
[01:06:49.668 --> 01:06:50.588]  I'm getting some Kallax.
[01:06:57.795 --> 01:06:58.435]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.096 --> 01:07:00.136]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.857 --> 01:07:01.977]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:03.438]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.199 --> 01:07:05.059]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.759 --> 01:07:09.742]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.942 --> 01:07:14.084]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.025 --> 01:07:20.668]  Last Thursday and Friday, there was an article written by the St.
[01:07:20.768 --> 01:07:22.129]  Louis Post-Dispatch
[01:07:23.466 --> 01:07:27.928]  As far as I can tell, it was carried in almost every major newspaper in the country.
[01:07:29.509 --> 01:07:38.372]  And when that happens, you know there's been lobbying, there's been a concerted effort, because it was carried by syndicates and papers that don't even normally carry St.
[01:07:38.412 --> 01:07:40.013]  Louis Post-Dispatch articles.
[01:07:40.913 --> 01:07:49.837]  I mean, this thing was in our local paper, it was in... from the New York Times to the Seattle Post.
[01:07:50.717 --> 01:07:51.417]  They carried it.
[01:07:51.577 --> 01:07:52.718]  It was everywhere.
[01:07:54.554 --> 01:07:56.656]  Showing me it's a key piece of enemy propaganda.
[01:07:57.476 --> 01:07:59.778]  In the headline they say there's no North American Union.
[01:07:59.838 --> 01:08:00.719]  It's an urban legend.
[01:08:01.079 --> 01:08:05.523]  They say it's the mother of all conspiracies and that we are complete liars.
[01:08:07.525 --> 01:08:08.525]  Now I got Bob Dacey.
[01:08:08.545 --> 01:08:09.346]  This is so important.
[01:08:09.366 --> 01:08:11.768]  I got Bob Dacey who's really an expert on the NAU.
[01:08:11.808 --> 01:08:12.909]  He constantly studies it.
[01:08:13.409 --> 01:08:19.354]  Coming in with all the actual documents and four-year documents and quotes and blueprints.
[01:08:20.195 --> 01:08:22.417]  He's coming in tomorrow for an hour in studio.
[01:08:22.437 --> 01:08:24.118]  We're going to shoot video of it and put it up on the web.
[01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:26.991]  For PrisonPlanet.tv folks.
[01:08:28.092 --> 01:08:29.153]  Because it's so important.
[01:08:31.435 --> 01:08:37.160]  This is like denying that America even exists, or denying George Washington was a real person.
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:43.785]  I mean, the level... But the general public will read that and think from ever onward that we're lying!
[01:08:46.347 --> 01:08:51.791]  That Ron Paul's lying, that Alex Jones is lying, that you're lying, that Lou Dobbs is lying.
[01:08:52.932 --> 01:08:54.714]  I mean, this is like saying
[01:08:56.534 --> 01:09:02.697]  Water on the periodic table, you know, is an H2O or something.
[01:09:07.338 --> 01:09:09.539]  I guess water is a combination, so it wouldn't be anyways.
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:15.101]  The point is that it's like denying that we breathe oxygen.
[01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:24.285]  It's just... But you've got to remember that committee chairmen over the war don't know the difference between Shiite and Sunni.
[01:09:27.512 --> 01:09:31.654]  So, when you understand that, you know the level the globalists are playing from.
[01:09:31.674 --> 01:09:38.076]  Alright, big Ron Paul news, his press conference, his riveting speech next hour, or the press conference this hour.
[01:09:38.516 --> 01:09:48.820]  But I want to get through your calls, then get into the immigration, the amnesty that dovetails with this NAU lie, and this latest hoax that is in every paper I've looked at.
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:55.783]  I just randomly went to big papers and did search engine queries with the headline with the name of the papers after it.
[01:09:55.863 --> 01:09:56.663]  It came up everywhere.
[01:09:57.614 --> 01:10:03.196]  Now, I only spot-checked it with six or seven, but I'd already seen it in more than twenty newspapers.
[01:10:03.256 --> 01:10:04.297]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[01:10:05.137 --> 01:10:06.358]  This thing must be everywhere.
[01:10:07.118 --> 01:10:11.180]  I mean, if I'm just seeing it everywhere, and everywhere I randomly checked it was there, we're in trouble.
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:13.621]  I mean, this was a big push.
[01:10:15.381 --> 01:10:20.943]  But what did the military do when they were ramming with tanks, armored vehicles up against Waco, and setting the church on fire?
[01:10:20.983 --> 01:10:22.104]  They said, this is not an assault.
[01:10:23.909 --> 01:10:31.658]  I mean, stealth bombers come in trying to block radar signatures so radar deflects, or actually absorbs, doesn't deflect.
[01:10:32.439 --> 01:10:33.380]  They're camouflaged.
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.062]  I mean, this is what enemy attacks do.
[01:10:35.442 --> 01:10:40.829]  They're going to run camo and they're going to run cloaking devices right up on us.
[01:10:41.758 --> 01:10:42.658]  It's military.
[01:10:42.718 --> 01:10:43.859]  It's done militarily.
[01:10:44.119 --> 01:10:46.159]  We're always shocked by how they lie.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.321]  But even with people on the fence, it takes them back and makes them hesitate.
[01:10:50.341 --> 01:10:57.943]  I mean, when I see bald-faced lies, I even go double-check documents and double-check announcements to think, well, am I lying?
[01:10:58.003 --> 01:10:59.084]  I mean, am I twisting?
[01:10:59.724 --> 01:11:00.904]  It makes me hesitate.
[01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:03.165]  And then I go, no, I'm not!
[01:11:03.605 --> 01:11:07.106]  They are complete liars, knowingly!
[01:11:08.887 --> 01:11:09.667]  Knowingly!
[01:11:11.084 --> 01:11:12.145]  It's like this amnesty.
[01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:14.327]  They're lying, saying it isn't an amnesty.
[01:11:14.347 --> 01:11:16.269]  They're lying, saying they gotta pay $5,000.
[01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:19.672]  They're lying, saying it builds a fence.
[01:11:19.712 --> 01:11:21.774]  They're lying, saying it does all these things.
[01:11:21.814 --> 01:11:24.797]  And I've looked into it, and I've looked at the stuff Senators have leaked.
[01:11:25.438 --> 01:11:27.560]  This thing is complete and total amnesty.
[01:11:28.621 --> 01:11:34.627]  It's got some flowery terms about security and fences, but then those are virtual fences that Chertoff will never build.
[01:11:37.851 --> 01:11:39.653]  Again, it's the level of lying.
[01:11:39.714 --> 01:11:42.938]  I was listening to the radio last night and this morning, watching some TV to monitor it.
[01:11:43.338 --> 01:11:47.684]  You'd think that this was going to stop the illegal aliens and save America.
[01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:48.705]  It's the opposite!
[01:11:48.725 --> 01:11:54.432]  I remember campaign finance reform to fix things six years ago.
[01:11:55.453 --> 01:11:56.535]  The McCain-Feingold bill.
[01:11:58.445 --> 01:11:59.246]  It did the opposite.
[01:11:59.366 --> 01:12:00.768]  It restricted free speech.
[01:12:00.848 --> 01:12:02.611]  It doubled the money corporations could give.
[01:12:03.011 --> 01:12:05.254]  It reduced what individual citizens could give.
[01:12:05.795 --> 01:12:11.342]  They claim that we can't interview gun rights groups or environmental groups, any group, six weeks before an election.
[01:12:11.382 --> 01:12:12.483]  Everybody just ignores it.
[01:12:13.024 --> 01:12:13.925]  So that's the good news.
[01:12:13.965 --> 01:12:14.666]  We just ignore it.
[01:12:15.007 --> 01:12:16.709]  It is law, though, that we have no First Amendment.
[01:12:17.049 --> 01:12:20.650]  But again, that is below the actual First Amendment, so it's null and void.
[01:12:20.690 --> 01:12:22.671]  Any law that's a violation of that is null and void.
[01:12:23.051 --> 01:12:27.233]  Marbury v. Madison and literally hundreds of other federal and state rulings say that.
[01:12:27.253 --> 01:12:30.294]  Of course, the dumb cops and the public don't know that, that serve the government.
[01:12:30.694 --> 01:12:32.694]  They don't know they're actually working for a criminal system.
[01:12:33.195 --> 01:12:34.375]  But the point is, we just ignore it.
[01:12:35.956 --> 01:12:42.678]  They called it reform, which has the connotation of it fixed things and stopped special interest in pork barrel.
[01:12:44.858 --> 01:12:45.499]  And bribes.
[01:12:45.679 --> 01:12:46.460]  It was the opposite.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.121]  It doubled them but restricted us.
[01:12:48.862 --> 01:12:52.485]  But see, they sold it as it was going to save us.
[01:12:54.467 --> 01:13:03.936]  I remember four years ago there were headlines, Bush signs law to protect your privacy with prescription drugs and health care.
[01:13:05.359 --> 01:13:06.980]  It made it completely transparent.
[01:13:07.641 --> 01:13:19.749]  All dentistry, all gynecology, every school of medicine, every sub-discipline, everything is instantly uploaded to the federal government.
[01:13:19.829 --> 01:13:21.871]  Every prescription you get, instantly.
[01:13:21.931 --> 01:13:25.573]  No warrants, no juries, no judges, no due process.
[01:13:25.593 --> 01:13:26.434]  You're all criminals.
[01:13:26.714 --> 01:13:28.015]  It's all instantly uploaded.
[01:13:28.455 --> 01:13:30.377]  They called it protecting your privacy.
[01:13:30.697 --> 01:13:31.918]  It did the exact opposite.
[01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:34.820]  It's the same thing with this amnesty deal.
[01:13:35.746 --> 01:13:37.628]  I mean, it's military.
[01:13:37.948 --> 01:13:43.774]  It's not a lie to the military that stealth bombers absorb radar and don't have a big radar signature.
[01:13:44.134 --> 01:13:46.376]  It's just we cloak our activities.
[01:13:46.817 --> 01:13:49.399]  We want to come in and drop 2,000 pound bombs on you.
[01:13:52.882 --> 01:13:58.808]  When a tank's got camouflage on it, they don't call that a lie, they call it camouflage.
[01:14:00.433 --> 01:14:04.216]  When they tell you that, you know, just stay in your foxholes, stay in your trenches.
[01:14:04.236 --> 01:14:07.999]  This happened in World War I, World War II, and Korea and Vietnam.
[01:14:08.299 --> 01:14:09.060]  Both sides did it.
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:10.241]  This is not an assault.
[01:14:10.341 --> 01:14:11.182]  Lay down your arms.
[01:14:11.202 --> 01:14:11.982]  This is not an assault.
[01:14:12.263 --> 01:14:21.510]  While artillery is firing at you and troops are literally bayonetting you in your foxholes, there are enemy troops coming over.
[01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:24.633]  Both sides do it with tanks blaring in your own language.
[01:14:24.853 --> 01:14:25.794]  This is not an assault.
[01:14:25.834 --> 01:14:26.194]  Lay down.
[01:14:27.748 --> 01:14:28.628]  That's all this is.
[01:14:29.169 --> 01:14:30.889]  Military PSYOP.
[01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:32.930]  There's no North American Union.
[01:14:33.150 --> 01:14:35.031]  There's no amnesty.
[01:14:35.231 --> 01:14:36.972]  There's only 12 million illegals.
[01:14:37.012 --> 01:14:37.612]  That's a lie.
[01:14:37.832 --> 01:14:39.213]  It's more like 36 million.
[01:14:39.713 --> 01:14:40.754]  It's all lies.
[01:14:44.095 --> 01:14:45.796]  And maybe you like being lied to.
[01:14:46.196 --> 01:14:47.497]  Okay, I said I'd get to it later.
[01:14:47.557 --> 01:14:48.557]  Let's go back to calls.
[01:14:49.157 --> 01:14:50.058]  Fred, I'm going to move quick.
[01:14:50.078 --> 01:14:51.038]  Fred in Oklahoma, go ahead.
[01:14:52.955 --> 01:14:57.658]  One of these illegal invaders' rights groups is hosting a 1-800 call-in number.
[01:14:58.298 --> 01:15:07.844]  You can call this number on the dime of the illegal aliens and tell your congressmen and senators, well, tell your senators what you think about immigration reform.
[01:15:08.525 --> 01:15:09.005]  Oh, good!
[01:15:09.045 --> 01:15:09.705]  Give us the number!
[01:15:09.725 --> 01:15:09.825]  800-882-2005 800-882-2005
[01:15:22.898 --> 01:15:23.919]  Let me have that number again.
[01:15:23.939 --> 01:15:24.820]  1-800-882-2005.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:33.927]  And you've tested that?
[01:15:34.347 --> 01:15:47.518]  Oh yes, and when you call it, you actually get a message in Spanish, and you press 1 to talk to your senior senator, and 2 to talk to the junior senator, and you can leave them a little message in their voice box.
[01:15:48.399 --> 01:15:52.903]  You press one or two, and then they play the instructions for you again, and you press one to connect.
[01:15:53.743 --> 01:16:04.933]  See, it's all in Spanish, except for the message that says, tell your Senators in English this message, and it's, uh, tell your Senators to grant citizenship to immigrants or some such thing.
[01:16:05.313 --> 01:16:11.518]  And by the way, the Illegal Aliens know how to work together as a team, because it is all about the Raza.
[01:16:12.293 --> 01:16:22.239]  Whereas everybody else is taught not to work together as teams or groups or tribes, they're taught to work as that by the globalists who are masters of tribal politics.
[01:16:22.599 --> 01:16:28.822]  And I knew that they were lobbying on all the Spanish-owned stations, owned by Clear Channel, and the rest of them.
[01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:31.284]  So that makes it even more key.
[01:16:31.304 --> 01:16:36.187]  So I guess they forward you through a 1-800 number to Congress.
[01:16:36.647 --> 01:16:38.088]  So that's a great way to do it.
[01:16:38.128 --> 01:16:39.649]  In fact, I'm going to do it during the next break.
[01:16:41.258 --> 01:16:42.079]  Think about this.
[01:16:42.099 --> 01:16:57.969]  Remember in December 2005, Christmas Day, Dallas Morning News reported that Rob Allen and Co., the same strategists that advised Rove, they're above Rove, and that helped Vicente Fox in his two campaigns, was going to have nationwide demonstrations.
[01:16:58.449 --> 01:16:59.850]  But it backfired.
[01:16:59.890 --> 01:17:02.151]  They had trucks of flags, American flags.
[01:17:02.171 --> 01:17:04.453]  The illegals didn't want them, so it backfired.
[01:17:05.208 --> 01:17:05.848]  A couple more quick points.
[01:17:05.868 --> 01:17:08.449]  Have you ever heard of a file sharing program called BitTorrent?
[01:17:08.609 --> 01:17:08.889]  Yes, I have.
[01:17:33.715 --> 01:17:36.616]  Okay, it's a really good way to get information.
[01:17:36.716 --> 01:17:40.178]  For instance, videos, audio, all that kind of stuff out there.
[01:17:40.258 --> 01:17:41.339]  And everybody can use it.
[01:17:42.479 --> 01:17:44.340]  It's free and so on and so forth.
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.822]  And I just think all your listeners should investigate that.
[01:17:48.742 --> 01:17:50.163]  And a third point.
[01:17:51.343 --> 01:17:57.886]  What is the possibility of people in various states getting together and setting up websites?
[01:17:59.571 --> 01:18:03.774]  Watchdog websites where we track the activities of Congress and Senators.
[01:18:04.154 --> 01:18:04.994]  I'm trying to do that.
[01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:07.756]  I'm producing one film.
[01:18:08.136 --> 01:18:09.697]  I'm executive producing another.
[01:18:10.238 --> 01:18:11.138]  I've got the office.
[01:18:11.178 --> 01:18:12.039]  I've got the computers.
[01:18:12.079 --> 01:18:25.227]  I have an empty office because I'm so busy trying to finish Endgame, I can't even interview the people I need to put them in the other office to start the social networking site for patriots on all those issues, but we're trying to do it.
[01:18:26.306 --> 01:18:27.587]  We're working as hard as we can.
[01:18:27.927 --> 01:18:31.469]  Just keep sending your resumes to Aaron at InfoWars.com and other places.
[01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.910]  We're stepping up.
[01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:34.011]  We'll do that too.
[01:18:34.611 --> 01:18:38.774]  That's another reason we need people's financial support so I can try to finance all this.
[01:18:38.834 --> 01:18:39.715]  I appreciate your call.
[01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:48.140]  And you support us, ladies and gentlemen, who again support Ron Paul and everybody else, by buying the books and videos at InfoWars.com.
[01:18:48.821 --> 01:18:51.703]  We'll be right back with more of your calls in the Ron Paul clips.
[01:18:51.743 --> 01:18:52.123]  Stay with us.
[01:18:55.177 --> 01:18:56.218]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:18:56.538 --> 01:18:59.340]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:03.763]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:19:04.184 --> 01:19:05.024]  So what do you do?
[01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:09.888]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:19:10.388 --> 01:19:12.509]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:19:12.989 --> 01:19:27.696]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:19:27.736 --> 01:19:34.800]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:39.544]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:19:40.005 --> 01:19:41.767]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[01:19:41.787 --> 01:19:42.067]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:19:42.087 --> 01:19:43.548]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:19:53.211 --> 01:19:53.651]  Gold.
[01:19:53.992 --> 01:19:55.272]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:19:55.532 --> 01:20:01.616]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:20:01.816 --> 01:20:05.619]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:20:05.979 --> 01:20:07.880]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.202]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:20:10.362 --> 01:20:17.266]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker and
[01:20:17.446 --> 01:20:18.366]  We're good to go.
[01:20:34.991 --> 01:20:35.572]  I think so.
[01:20:52.771 --> 01:20:53.591]  Attention gardeners!
[01:20:53.671 --> 01:20:56.032]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:20:56.252 --> 01:21:00.594]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[01:21:00.794 --> 01:21:08.657]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:21:08.977 --> 01:21:11.819]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:21:12.099 --> 01:21:19.643]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:21:19.743 --> 01:21:25.326]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:21:25.566 --> 01:21:31.129]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:21:31.389 --> 01:21:34.711]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:21:34.951 --> 01:21:38.293]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:21:38.533 --> 01:21:43.577]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dervsheet Superfood should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:21:43.597 --> 01:21:46.620]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:21:47.481 --> 01:21:51.824]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:21:52.365 --> 01:21:58.350]  So you take care of your car, you change the oil, tune it up on a regular basis, and always make sure that it's running at its best.
[01:21:58.570 --> 01:22:00.872]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[01:22:01.152 --> 01:22:09.442]  That's why you need SFR's Protekta Synthetic Oil Treatments, Protekta Engine Treatment, Protekta Transmission Treatment, and Protekta Complete Fuel System Treatment.
[01:22:09.662 --> 01:22:17.431]  Protekta meets the demands you put on your vehicle by providing more horsepower, improving gas mileage, decreasing emissions, and promotes longer engine life.
[01:22:17.732 --> 01:22:20.535]  Only Protekta contains a new technology, NanoBeam.
[01:22:20.775 --> 01:22:21.195]  We're good to go!
[01:22:47.984 --> 01:22:51.625]  Or visit www.sfrcorp.com Call now!
[01:22:51.645 --> 01:22:59.547]  Oh, boom bop-a-boom Oh, boom bop-a-boom Oh, boom bop-a-boom At a glance I looked at you
[01:23:24.938 --> 01:23:26.299]  Look at Ron Paul!
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:33.864]  The New World Order knows that we're rising against them on every front.
[01:23:34.004 --> 01:23:35.065]  Thank God for that.
[01:23:35.085 --> 01:23:38.627]  At least we won't go down without a fight.
[01:23:38.647 --> 01:23:40.969]  You can know that, and hey, we might win with God's help.
[01:23:44.651 --> 01:23:47.533]  Let's go ahead and go to Jeff in Indiana.
[01:23:47.553 --> 01:23:49.794]  He's the last caller in line, but he says he disagrees.
[01:23:49.835 --> 01:23:50.435]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:23:51.391 --> 01:23:52.851]  Hi Alex, it's great to talk to you.
[01:23:52.871 --> 01:23:55.172]  I can't believe the first time I haven't listened to you for a couple years.
[01:23:55.192 --> 01:23:57.493]  I can't believe the first time I'm talking to you I disagree, but here you go.
[01:23:58.153 --> 01:23:59.773]  I have three things actually I disagree with you on.
[01:23:59.913 --> 01:24:04.295]  First, I disagree with you on the Ron Paul and 9-1-1 issue.
[01:24:04.315 --> 01:24:13.357]  I think that he's hurting the 9-1-1 truth movement by sort of playing the game that he's, uh, thinks that Osama Bin Laden is, you know, separate from the CIA and all this kind of stuff.
[01:24:13.377 --> 01:24:15.558]  I think that's really a bad thing going on.
[01:24:15.578 --> 01:24:18.378]  I think it's hurting the 9-1-1 truth movement and I think that he should stop.
[01:24:18.398 --> 01:24:19.379]  He's got the spotlight.
[01:24:19.399 --> 01:24:20.659]  I think he needs to come clean.
[01:24:21.545 --> 01:24:24.426]  On the issue right now, there'd be a huge boost forward for 9-1-1 Truth.
[01:24:24.806 --> 01:24:31.887]  My second issue I disagree on is with you and Aaron Russo last week.
[01:24:32.507 --> 01:24:37.488]  I think that you guys were sort of changing the tune to talk about we should have a violent revolution.
[01:24:38.028 --> 01:24:39.648]  I think that you guys are wrong about this.
[01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:41.089]  I think we'll lose if we do that.
[01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:48.210]  They've got too many microwave weapons and... Well, number one, I didn't say that, so what you just said is completely false.
[01:24:48.832 --> 01:24:50.495]  Well, no, I think Aaron Russo was.
[01:24:50.755 --> 01:24:51.877]  He just said, I said that.
[01:24:52.698 --> 01:24:56.544]  Well, I thought you were agreeing with him to some degree, like going along with it at least.
[01:24:57.466 --> 01:25:02.033]  Well, Aaron's fighting for his life right now with cancer and he's really upset about what's happening and he was just angry.
[01:25:02.939 --> 01:25:04.080]  But I do disagree with you.
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:06.461]  If we do have a physical fight, sir, we're going to win.
[01:25:07.021 --> 01:25:14.004]  Because most of the military personnel I talk to know about the New World Order, know 9-11 is an inside job now, and aren't going to go along with it.
[01:25:14.224 --> 01:25:21.708]  That's why they're racing to turn the Army mainly into Mexican troops and Filipino and Eastern Bloc troops.
[01:25:21.768 --> 01:25:25.670]  And for those that didn't know, they've got huge recruiting stations worldwide.
[01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:30.752]  A year ago, 20% of the ground force of the Army in Iraq was Latin American.
[01:25:31.828 --> 01:25:34.711]  We're in a crisis there, but we'll defeat them too.
[01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:44.798]  I'm trying to wake up as many people as we can before the globalists get violent, so that once the fight starts, we've done enough weight lifting, and gotten our brains straight, and done enough combat training.
[01:25:44.818 --> 01:25:48.361]  I mean that in a preparatory way with waking up the body politic.
[01:25:48.381 --> 01:25:49.722]  I don't mean that individually.
[01:25:50.182 --> 01:25:51.944]  To crush the enemy quickly and swiftly.
[01:25:52.604 --> 01:26:03.333]  If they try a military option against certain targets to intimidate the public, if there is swift counter-strikes against enemy forces, they will back off and drop that option very quickly.
[01:26:03.593 --> 01:26:10.618]  That gets into a very complex, long-term strategy, which I haven't even dealt with or pushed for here on air.
[01:26:10.698 --> 01:26:12.660]  But if push comes to shove, sir,
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:19.622]  I feel sorry for the quote security services that try to bring in Stalinist tyranny here in the United States.
[01:26:19.722 --> 01:26:23.583]  They will be completely annihilated in a matter of days.
[01:26:24.103 --> 01:26:26.044]  But doesn't the New World Order want it?
[01:26:26.064 --> 01:26:26.744]  That's phase two.
[01:26:26.864 --> 01:26:27.765]  Yes, exactly.
[01:26:27.845 --> 01:26:28.685]  Phase two is to bring in
[01:26:29.005 --> 01:26:33.447]  Massive hordes of international I-4 troops, and that's why I don't want violence.
[01:26:33.747 --> 01:26:39.149]  And so I agree with you, violence is not what we need, but I'm just telling you, sir, we cannot go to the FEMA camps.
[01:26:39.409 --> 01:26:40.830]  We cannot get on the army trucks.
[01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:42.990]  We cannot put our children on the army trucks.
[01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:44.131]  We have to resist.
[01:26:45.251 --> 01:26:48.893]  Yeah, no, I think it's the Gandhi approach.
[01:26:48.933 --> 01:26:57.376]  We just need to sit back and wait for... To a point, sir, I am not an offensive person physically, but if you
[01:26:58.502 --> 01:27:07.973]  If you've got a bunch of monkeys running around confiscating guns and dragging families out of houses, I'm just not going to talk about what I'm going to do.
[01:27:08.434 --> 01:27:10.556]  Hell will freeze over before I go along with that.
[01:27:11.077 --> 01:27:14.861]  Oh no, I agree, but that would be a defensive move, not an offensive move.
[01:27:16.539 --> 01:27:22.529]  Yeah, I wrote a book and in it I show that the way to beat them is to not participate with the corporations.
[01:27:22.689 --> 01:27:23.531]  You have to.
[01:27:24.011 --> 01:27:29.721]  If we were all self-sufficient in America, all gun owners self-sufficient, having our own little farms and so forth, there is really no problem.
[01:27:30.484 --> 01:27:31.425]  I think that's the key.
[01:27:31.445 --> 01:27:31.945]  That's right.
[01:27:32.346 --> 01:27:33.807]  Listen, that is the key.
[01:27:33.887 --> 01:27:41.234]  People, but again, key patriots, everybody I know here in Austin, people that work for me all went out of Austin, but we have to be here to fight.
[01:27:41.274 --> 01:27:47.639]  This is the infrastructure, but within a year or two the technology is going to be there to be out in the country.
[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:50.462]  Now that's good for the small fish in the patriot movement.
[01:27:50.862 --> 01:27:54.766]  It is not good for big fish because then they can isolate you and call you a cult and kill you.
[01:27:56.007 --> 01:28:05.433]  And Waco, with their computer models, was really a preemptive precedent-setting case, they thought, to barbeque people alive, calling anyone outside of city cults.
[01:28:05.993 --> 01:28:07.614]  So that was also a key trial balloon.
[01:28:07.834 --> 01:28:09.175]  They have foreseen those threats.
[01:28:09.556 --> 01:28:15.920]  Real ID Act, premises ID, animal ID is about shutting down the small community areas.
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:23.825]  But just having five acres somewhere in the country that you can bug out to with a year's supply of food and tents.
[01:28:24.486 --> 01:28:34.228]  I mean, if people can only afford that, if you can only afford ten acres in the desert, you can still buy stuff out in the desert, you know, for cheap, and if it's got water, you're sitting pretty.
[01:28:34.628 --> 01:28:42.190]  And then you just sit there like a rattlesnake, shaking your tail, leave me alone, leave me alone, and the globalists will leave you alone, by and large.
[01:28:43.530 --> 01:28:44.471]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.911 --> 01:28:46.511]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.431 --> 01:28:50.112]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:55.342 --> 01:29:57.884]  What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:29:58.204 --> 01:30:00.085]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[01:30:00.285 --> 01:30:03.327]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:30:03.507 --> 01:30:06.650]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:08.831]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:30:09.091 --> 01:30:12.794]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:15.736]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[01:30:16.356 --> 01:30:20.659]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[01:30:20.859 --> 01:30:25.102]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[01:30:25.522 --> 01:30:29.864]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[01:30:30.165 --> 01:30:34.427]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.

[01:30:53.604 --> 01:30:56.045]  David J. Smith for News Watch Magazine.
[01:30:56.825 --> 01:31:02.446]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[01:31:02.486 --> 01:31:03.246]  Supreme Court.
[01:31:04.007 --> 01:31:08.308]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in a 9-0 decision of the U.S.
[01:31:08.348 --> 01:31:11.988]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[01:31:12.949 --> 01:31:18.170]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[01:31:18.999 --> 01:31:27.285]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:31:53.404 --> 01:31:56.025]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:31:56.586 --> 01:31:59.368]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:10.763 --> 01:32:29.095]  Alright, let me run through your calls really fast here, and then I'm going to get more into Ron Paul, the open borders, the amnesty, the North American Union hoax, where they're saying that we're hoaxing and it doesn't exist.
[01:32:29.956 --> 01:32:30.996]  It's military ops.
[01:32:31.557 --> 01:32:32.237]  It's lying.
[01:32:32.577 --> 01:32:33.378]  It's camouflage.
[01:32:33.855 --> 01:32:40.562]  They will deny that it's an attack until the knife goes in between the vertebrae of your spine.
[01:32:41.763 --> 01:32:44.606]  Robert in Washington, thanks for holding, you're on the air.
[01:32:45.947 --> 01:32:46.568]  Alex Jones?
[01:32:46.868 --> 01:32:47.508]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:32:47.528 --> 01:32:52.433]  Okay, he said Alex Jones and hung up.
[01:32:52.714 --> 01:32:53.875]  I guess his phone went dead.
[01:32:53.895 --> 01:32:55.917]  You can call back, Robert, if you can get in.
[01:32:56.337 --> 01:32:58.079]  Richard in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:32:58.706 --> 01:33:05.490]  Hey Alex, God bless and keep you and I'm just so pleased to see the great effort that's coming out of your operation.
[01:33:05.630 --> 01:33:20.599]  It's really wonderful to see the amped up use of activism and tools and the team that you've got working behind you now to help push these things along and it just seems like things are on an ever-improving track in terms of activism and opportunities.
[01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:37.590]  I noticed today that there is a technology that may be put to use in our national parks and similar places for metal detectors, which, you know, they would allege would be put in there for the hampering of poaching operations.
[01:33:38.050 --> 01:33:42.573]  But, you know, clearly that technology could be used for... Excuse me?
[01:33:42.653 --> 01:33:46.795]  Now they're going to make everybody going through national parks go through metal detectors?
[01:33:47.476 --> 01:33:47.616]  Yep.
[01:33:48.706 --> 01:33:57.260]  Well, no, these are buried metal detectors that will be out along trails and that sort of thing to detect movements of people with guns.
[01:33:58.983 --> 01:33:59.504]  You're kidding.
[01:34:00.185 --> 01:34:00.346]  Nope.
[01:34:01.058 --> 01:34:01.778]  Where did you see this?
[01:34:01.818 --> 01:34:04.859]  I haven't put them in yet, but the technology is here right now.
[01:34:04.919 --> 01:34:05.819]  The companies in the U.S.
[01:34:05.899 --> 01:34:15.281]  are shipping them overseas to be used in poaching situations, but already the National Parks has expressed an interest in putting them in our parks.
[01:34:15.581 --> 01:34:16.141]  Amazing!
[01:34:16.321 --> 01:34:25.923]  I do know that they have spent billions, and I mean the Feds, and your phone's breaking up, I'm going to let you go, they have spent billions
[01:34:27.737 --> 01:34:37.228]  Just in New York alone, the Feds have paid to put cameras and face scanning software and software that reads your lips is going in all over the place.
[01:34:37.808 --> 01:34:38.709]  And people get confused.
[01:34:38.729 --> 01:34:41.973]  They say, well, is it a face scanning camera or does it read your lips or does it?
[01:34:42.413 --> 01:34:49.461]  You can take any high quality digital camera that gives them enough resolution and then feed it through different software packages.
[01:34:50.146 --> 01:35:04.075]  So these cameras have got stuff that analyzes your walk, that listens to your speech, that talks back at you with loudspeakers, that reads your lips and chronicles what you're saying, that scans your face.
[01:35:04.235 --> 01:35:06.036]  It's in nationwide.
[01:35:06.696 --> 01:35:10.759]  Every major city already has cameras going through these federal packages.
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:17.303]  Every city has literally thousands of high-def cameras already installed.
[01:35:18.533 --> 01:35:19.854]  What do they do on the border, though?
[01:35:20.054 --> 01:35:29.923]  They literally put 20-year-old cameras up on poles, 15 to 20 miles away from the borders, where they are next to worthless.
[01:35:31.084 --> 01:35:42.855]  You know, I heard Ron Paul in this press conference that we videotaped, that we sent a reporter to, Saturday night here in Austin, talk about the military hiring the Border Patrol to go over to Iraq.
[01:35:43.826 --> 01:35:45.466]  And they say you learn something every day.
[01:35:45.486 --> 01:35:48.667]  You would have thought that if this started a year ago, I would have known about it.
[01:35:48.807 --> 01:35:49.527]  I didn't know about it.
[01:35:50.588 --> 01:35:51.468]  I googled it.
[01:35:52.108 --> 01:36:00.890]  I googled it and I found photos, video of the Border Patrol in Iraq doing house-to-house searches, border control.
[01:36:02.051 --> 01:36:06.852]  I found mainstream news articles where the government gives them a $25,000 bonus
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:18.784]  And gives them a government paycheck and a DynCorp paycheck to incentivize them to go to Iraq.
[01:36:18.804 --> 01:36:22.106]  Now understand, Border Patrol barely make enough to live.
[01:36:22.146 --> 01:36:25.188]  They make less than most city cops.
[01:36:25.308 --> 01:36:26.308]  They harass them.
[01:36:26.328 --> 01:36:27.209]  They're mean to them.
[01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:39.916]  It has some of the highest entrance exams and training exams and some of the most rigorous military training to get into it of any law enforcement in the United States.
[01:36:41.821 --> 01:36:48.385]  They make them sit on one quadrant and look left or right, north or south, one direction on the compass.
[01:36:48.945 --> 01:36:53.328]  If they look any other direction and report illegals, they are written up.
[01:36:53.368 --> 01:36:55.609]  If they do it three times, they're kicked out of the Border Patrol.
[01:36:56.409 --> 01:36:58.290]  Imagine being a Border Patrol officer.
[01:36:58.530 --> 01:37:00.792]  You're not allowed to look, but one direction.
[01:37:01.312 --> 01:37:02.173]  And you can't report it.
[01:37:02.933 --> 01:37:05.294]  Folks, that's a four-year-old announcement.
[01:37:05.795 --> 01:37:08.056]  They also make them spend half their time
[01:37:09.094 --> 01:37:13.157]  In the scrub brush in South Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, California.
[01:37:13.657 --> 01:37:14.898]  Very dangerous here in my state.
[01:37:14.918 --> 01:37:15.678]  Full of rattlesnakes.
[01:37:16.078 --> 01:37:17.439]  Picking up trash.
[01:37:20.101 --> 01:37:21.662]  In the brush, picking up trash.
[01:37:22.522 --> 01:37:24.503]  Anything they can do to burn the time.
[01:37:24.744 --> 01:37:26.485]  You can't look but one direction.
[01:37:26.525 --> 01:37:27.805]  You gotta pick trash up.
[01:37:28.326 --> 01:37:29.386]  You can't pursue.
[01:37:29.466 --> 01:37:33.609]  You can't speed over the speed limit when chasing an illegal alien.
[01:37:36.152 --> 01:37:39.074]  Police are told, don't arrest illegals, the Feds won't pick them up.
[01:37:39.135 --> 01:37:39.895]  That's on record.
[01:37:40.396 --> 01:37:43.198]  They don't have to have any type of ID to get bank accounts.
[01:37:43.218 --> 01:37:43.758]  You know that.
[01:37:44.139 --> 01:37:45.059]  But citizens!
[01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:46.400]  Ha!
[01:37:46.781 --> 01:37:49.003]  You try running from the cops, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:50.884 --> 01:37:53.847]  I mean, they'll shut down half the city.
[01:37:53.887 --> 01:37:55.108]  They'll have helicopters.
[01:37:55.208 --> 01:37:55.668]  It's over.
[01:37:55.888 --> 01:37:57.249]  They'll shoot your tires out.
[01:37:57.790 --> 01:38:00.172]  I mean, you thought that Hitler was on the loose.
[01:38:02.091 --> 01:38:04.792]  You see, but the illegals are meant to be brought in.
[01:38:04.832 --> 01:38:06.994]  It's a key to the New World Order.
[01:38:07.034 --> 01:38:07.674]  They gotta do it.
[01:38:07.694 --> 01:38:12.556]  In fact, I've been taking call after call, but I've been going too long with callers, so I'm just going to cover this right now.
[01:38:12.576 --> 01:38:24.122]  I'm going to go ahead and get into the illegal aliens now, and then I'm going to, and the amnesty, and then I'll get into Ron Paul and continue with your calls for David and Sasha and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:38:27.464 --> 01:38:30.946]  Since I'm saying I'm going to do that, let me get into my stack and get past all Ron Paul stuff.
[01:38:34.273 --> 01:38:46.682]  Urban legend, North American Union, Bush's plan B may be to attack Iran, immigration bill will require re-verification of 145 million American workers.
[01:38:47.343 --> 01:38:48.003]  Here we are.
[01:38:50.345 --> 01:38:52.327]  Let me just start the story with this today.
[01:38:52.952 --> 01:38:54.073]  This is out of Newsmax.
[01:38:54.654 --> 01:38:56.336]  They took excerpts out of an AP article.
[01:38:56.937 --> 01:39:03.744]  An illegal alien, and by the way, we see this every two days, and I'm not looking for this, so I would imagine it's probably happening every day.
[01:39:05.386 --> 01:39:10.512]  I do know the majority of murders in Los Angeles are committed by illegal aliens.
[01:39:11.537 --> 01:39:11.817]  Why?
[01:39:11.877 --> 01:39:20.141]  Because already Mexico literally dumps its illegal aliens, dumps its criminals, like Castro did, in the north.
[01:39:20.181 --> 01:39:24.223]  They even bus them to northern towns and dump them out, and then coyotes bring them across.
[01:39:25.503 --> 01:39:25.963]  They get here.
[01:39:25.983 --> 01:39:27.444]  They're already criminals to be here to begin with.
[01:39:27.964 --> 01:39:36.148]  Illegal shoots deputy in the face, an illegal immigrant with a lengthy criminal record, has been charged with shooting a Wisconsin sheriff's deputy in the face and killing him.
[01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:44.575]  And this just happened in Waco and Houston in the last month and outside one of the towns outside San Antonio it just happened.
[01:39:44.915 --> 01:39:46.436]  But it's all kept real quiet.
[01:39:48.217 --> 01:39:50.179]  Cop pulls him over, shoot him in the face.
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:55.823]  But the cops can't even arrest him for no insurance or no driver's license.
[01:39:57.964 --> 01:40:04.169]  But God forbid you get pulled over driving with your family to the beach, they'll start talking about taking your kids from you.
[01:40:04.769 --> 01:40:05.470]  They'll have some
[01:40:06.747 --> 01:40:12.070]  You know, a bull female with a shaved head sitting there looking at you with hatred because she just hates men.
[01:40:13.171 --> 01:40:14.091]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:40:16.413 --> 01:40:28.500]  Esquel Lopez was charged in the death of Kennesaw County Sheriff's Deputy Frank Fabio, Fabian, Fabiano, there.
[01:40:29.230 --> 01:40:37.917]  According to WTMJ TV in Milwaukee, a criminal complaint against Lopez admits to drinking tequila on a night of the murder and doing cocaine.
[01:40:38.477 --> 01:40:41.119]  But he told investigators he doesn't remember shooting anyone.
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:46.804]  Lopez's criminal record includes, and I can't read the toupee, I just can't read it all.
[01:40:48.165 --> 01:40:52.368]  He was arrested in Utah for lewd and lascivious conduct.
[01:40:53.576 --> 01:40:55.197]  That was 2001.
[01:40:55.237 --> 01:40:58.360]  2003, he was arrested in Texas on a gun charge.
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:01.122]  That's sealed.
[01:41:01.142 --> 01:41:04.365]  2003, Lopez was picked up in Missouri for O.W.I.
[01:41:05.126 --> 01:41:06.447]  What's O.W.I.?
[01:41:06.647 --> 01:41:08.288]  I don't know what it is.
[01:41:08.609 --> 01:41:15.734]  2004, Kennesaw, Kenosha police arrested him on charges of domestic battery, disorderly conduct, bail jumping.
[01:41:17.496 --> 01:41:18.176]  I can't read it all.
[01:41:18.197 --> 01:41:18.657]  We're out of time.
[01:41:20.552 --> 01:41:22.133]  But, uh, this is standard.
[01:41:22.153 --> 01:41:23.334]  Remember the railway killer?
[01:41:23.754 --> 01:41:25.835]  He'd killed like 16 people they know of.
[01:41:26.115 --> 01:41:26.895]  He'd been released.
[01:41:27.236 --> 01:41:28.977]  It was 20 plus times, I know that.
[01:41:29.797 --> 01:41:31.738]  And, I mean, murders, rapes, killing.
[01:41:31.778 --> 01:41:35.420]  He was like a literal demon creature enjoying himself.
[01:41:36.821 --> 01:41:37.821]  And it just didn't matter.
[01:41:37.961 --> 01:41:39.142]  Finally caught him in Texas.
[01:41:39.942 --> 01:41:46.886]  Because there was a state police sign walking down the road and had done a little bit of homework and recognized him.
[01:41:47.186 --> 01:41:48.367]  But that was the only reason.
[01:41:51.659 --> 01:41:56.662]  And, uh, it's... I want most of your home invasions down to Southwest for illegal aliens.
[01:41:57.162 --> 01:41:58.723]  And it's because, folks, they know.
[01:41:58.903 --> 01:42:00.044]  Nobody knows their name.
[01:42:00.064 --> 01:42:01.344]  They don't have IDs on them.
[01:42:01.725 --> 01:42:02.745]  They can do whatever they want.
[01:42:05.667 --> 01:42:10.109]  But the cops will routinely arrest citizens for not having IDs at parks.
[01:42:11.630 --> 01:42:12.090]  Fill your ID.
[01:42:12.110 --> 01:42:13.571]  They'll just pull up and go, let me see your IDs.
[01:42:13.651 --> 01:42:14.091]  I'm sorry.
[01:42:14.131 --> 01:42:14.892]  I live right over there.
[01:42:14.992 --> 01:42:15.872]  I don't... That's it.
[01:42:15.912 --> 01:42:16.953]  Get in the squad car.
[01:42:18.439 --> 01:42:22.723]  And the Border Patrol hired over a thousand agents, I learned.
[01:42:23.843 --> 01:42:25.345]  Over a thousand agents.
[01:42:27.026 --> 01:42:30.369]  $25,000 signing bonus.
[01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:34.612]  And they're paid $120,000 a year starting.
[01:42:35.032 --> 01:42:40.257]  You know what a Border Patrol agent who's a senior, we're talking 15-20 years, you know how much they make?
[01:42:40.277 --> 01:42:40.657]  $40,000 a year.
[01:42:40.717 --> 01:42:43.459]  Folks, $40,000 a year is nothing.
[01:42:43.639 --> 01:42:43.940]  Nothing.
[01:42:48.291 --> 01:42:49.032]  Same thing with the cops.
[01:42:49.052 --> 01:42:52.395]  They tell these fools, oh, you gotta go write more tickets or we're gonna have to have cuts.
[01:42:53.616 --> 01:42:56.018]  And the average cop raises close to 300 grand a year.
[01:42:56.078 --> 01:42:57.158]  You are so stupid.
[01:42:57.178 --> 01:42:59.540]  Of course, we're all stupid.
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:00.701]  I'm not just singling you out.
[01:43:01.462 --> 01:43:03.083]  But they just play you like a fiddle.
[01:43:03.464 --> 01:43:05.906]  Oh, we got a crackdown on fines and fees, men and women.
[01:43:05.926 --> 01:43:07.407]  We're having a shortfall.
[01:43:08.608 --> 01:43:09.809]  There's no shortfall.
[01:43:09.829 --> 01:43:14.413]  They're hiring cops like they're going out of style because you're bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:43:15.854 --> 01:43:18.135]  Then they tell you to go squeeze this because there's no money!
[01:43:19.256 --> 01:43:20.677]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:43:21.257 --> 01:43:22.178]  I mean, it's sick!
[01:43:23.319 --> 01:43:27.881]  Next time a cop pulls you over and wants to see your ID, you go, well, I got one officer, but why should I show it to you?
[01:43:28.162 --> 01:43:31.003]  You know you're not supposed to arrest illegal aliens, and if you do, they're released.
[01:43:31.804 --> 01:43:34.766]  Just give me, and they'll look down, and I do that, just give me the license.
[01:43:35.246 --> 01:43:36.667]  Yeah, I know, just give me the license.
[01:43:37.687 --> 01:43:39.648]  That's right, I'm the big, fat hog.
[01:43:39.989 --> 01:43:41.570]  I'm the big, dumb American.
[01:43:41.890 --> 01:43:45.172]  Trained how to serve you, trained how to jump through all your hoops.
[01:43:47.265 --> 01:43:53.106]  Trained how to do everything, but when an illegal alien rear-ended me and the cops came, they just wrote up a report and let him go.
[01:43:57.147 --> 01:43:59.607]  By the way, that happened to me 10 years ago.
[01:44:00.127 --> 01:44:01.088]  Was it 9 years ago?
[01:44:01.108 --> 01:44:04.088]  Or 98, yeah, about 9 years ago.
[01:44:04.768 --> 01:44:05.849]  That happened to me.
[01:44:10.169 --> 01:44:13.270]  It also breeds crime because the illegals are afraid to call the police.
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:17.421]  And so then in their own communities, the gangs really get out of control.
[01:44:17.601 --> 01:44:23.643]  But now they've announced all over the country in 860 plus sanctuary cities, don't worry, we won't arrest you, call us for whatever crime.
[01:44:26.565 --> 01:44:27.805]  So there's the excuse for that.
[01:44:27.905 --> 01:44:38.729]  So we have four different senators have seen sections of the bill who were in the two committees vetting all of this in the Senate, in the secret agreement last week, they've been able to see subsections.
[01:44:39.049 --> 01:44:43.551]  There is a Z visa that is unlimited.
[01:44:44.531 --> 01:44:46.312]  Total amnesty for anyone here.
[01:44:46.452 --> 01:44:47.393]  Anyone can apply.
[01:44:47.413 --> 01:44:54.038]  They can apply with a consular matricula that literally come in Cracker Jack boxes.
[01:44:54.678 --> 01:45:01.503]  I mean, they will, the head of the Republican Senate, I had him on a few years ago, he was in the major papers, the Denver Post and others.
[01:45:02.184 --> 01:45:05.346]  In just four hours, he got four matriculas.
[01:45:06.664 --> 01:45:09.845]  Took him an hour to apply for each and get it at the same office.
[01:45:09.905 --> 01:45:11.306]  He just went in over and over again.
[01:45:11.526 --> 01:45:12.927]  And it was a white guy that gave it to him.
[01:45:13.187 --> 01:45:14.487]  Can you imagine with the illegals?
[01:45:14.848 --> 01:45:15.988]  He was just giving fake names.
[01:45:17.149 --> 01:45:18.069]  And boom, it's over.
[01:45:18.649 --> 01:45:25.512]  So, just with the government numbers, the illegals take close to three times what they pay in taxes.
[01:45:26.092 --> 01:45:30.214]  In the anchor babies, in the hospitalization at the emergency rooms, and the welfare.
[01:45:30.394 --> 01:45:31.195]  And who blames them?
[01:45:31.375 --> 01:45:32.135]  Would you rather live?
[01:45:33.328 --> 01:45:38.489]  In Mexico City with 36 million people, where you're a total slave of a tyrannical government owned by the New World Order?
[01:45:39.530 --> 01:45:43.891]  Or will you fight kicking and screaming to come work up here for six bucks an hour, five bucks an hour?
[01:45:43.911 --> 01:45:47.592]  And of course you can't live on that for the corporations and the meat packers.
[01:45:47.912 --> 01:45:54.053]  But see, the corporations got it set up where you're allowed to get welfare off the middle class tax money to then subsidize.
[01:45:54.093 --> 01:45:55.954]  See, we're subsidizing the corporations.
[01:45:56.694 --> 01:45:59.817]  And yeah, it gives some illegals a better life, and I don't particularly mind them.
[01:46:00.738 --> 01:46:01.858]  I know you read what you sell.
[01:46:01.898 --> 01:46:03.039]  I know what comes around goes around.
[01:46:03.099 --> 01:46:03.760]  I have empathy.
[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:05.421]  I want them to live in nicer houses.
[01:46:06.082 --> 01:46:07.843]  I want them to have good meals.
[01:46:08.324 --> 01:46:13.148]  I appreciate when I see illegal aliens that I see them appreciating food they're getting at the grocery store.
[01:46:13.368 --> 01:46:15.810]  I can see them appreciating their families.
[01:46:15.870 --> 01:46:20.534]  I can see they're very healthy in many ways, psychologically, culturally.
[01:46:20.694 --> 01:46:21.534]  They're tribal.
[01:46:21.835 --> 01:46:23.236]  You're supposed to be like that, folks.
[01:46:23.616 --> 01:46:24.577]  They're pro-family.
[01:46:24.597 --> 01:46:25.778]  You're supposed to be like that.
[01:46:25.958 --> 01:46:27.679]  They enjoy simple things.
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:29.521]  They're good, smart people.
[01:46:31.102 --> 01:46:32.343]  But they hate America's guts.
[01:46:32.843 --> 01:46:33.564]  Be clear on that.
[01:46:34.044 --> 01:46:35.125]  And they're bringing the country down.
[01:46:36.126 --> 01:46:36.426]  Okay?
[01:46:36.726 --> 01:46:45.373]  So, you know, just like I may admire a rattlesnake or a coral snake, but the point is it's deadly dangerous to this country.
[01:46:46.915 --> 01:46:49.236]  I may admire, you know,
[01:46:52.654 --> 01:46:53.314]  Darth Vader.
[01:46:53.415 --> 01:46:56.336]  But you know, in the fantasy world, Darth Vader is dangerous, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:57.677 --> 01:47:01.699]  So the point is, is that you've got this culturally guilty, pathetic America.
[01:47:01.839 --> 01:47:03.440]  I mean, we are made to be taken over.
[01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:04.561]  We're like a weak host.
[01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:12.998]  We're like somebody who doesn't have any immune system being completely overrun and there's just nothing we can do unless we wake up and rise to the occasion.
[01:47:13.558 --> 01:47:26.772]  So the elite, and here's the other deal, for the illegals that are already here, and that's why a lot of illegals that are here know this because they are street smart and wise, a lot of illegals don't want more illegals because they know the more that comes the more their wages goes down.
[01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:33.182]  What you can't teach some dumb middle-class black guy or white guy, you can teach an illegal alien.
[01:47:33.882 --> 01:47:35.442]  Because they're not stupid.
[01:47:36.122 --> 01:47:42.764]  And a lot of them are like, oh, I agree, I'm even here illegally, or, well, I came here legally, but, you know, I make 20 bucks an hour as a truck driver.
[01:47:42.804 --> 01:47:44.685]  Yeah, I don't want these people here.
[01:47:45.505 --> 01:47:46.745]  Because they can do math.
[01:47:47.045 --> 01:47:50.406]  They know there's over 100 million new births a year in Latin America.
[01:47:50.466 --> 01:47:51.186]  Yeah, did you know that?
[01:47:51.707 --> 01:47:53.247]  Or close to it, it was 80-something million.
[01:47:53.843 --> 01:47:57.445]  When they know there's a hundred million in Mexico, thirty million Mexicans here.
[01:47:58.125 --> 01:48:00.726]  Well, twenty-something million of that's Mexicans, the others are Latin American.
[01:48:03.968 --> 01:48:04.808]  They're not stupid.
[01:48:05.208 --> 01:48:07.129]  The illegals that are here now, they know.
[01:48:07.149 --> 01:48:11.431]  And by the way, now the Chinese, the South Koreans, others, they've all learned.
[01:48:11.731 --> 01:48:12.892]  Eastern Europeans have learned.
[01:48:13.212 --> 01:48:17.354]  They can fly in on a visa, claim their tourist visa, come in here two weeks before
[01:48:19.204 --> 01:48:21.465]  And again, over 10,000 South Koreans last year.
[01:48:21.965 --> 01:48:25.866]  Came in, boom, went in and had $12,000 on average births.
[01:48:26.706 --> 01:48:26.987]  Boom.
[01:48:27.027 --> 01:48:27.887]  They're now citizens.
[01:48:27.927 --> 01:48:28.847]  That baby's citizens.
[01:48:29.147 --> 01:48:30.007]  The parents are here.
[01:48:30.228 --> 01:48:31.028]  It's over, folks.
[01:48:31.288 --> 01:48:34.769]  And boy, they know how to not knock any Europeans either.
[01:48:35.609 --> 01:48:36.809]  I'm just stating the facts.
[01:48:37.630 --> 01:48:40.591]  They're experts at sucking off the government because that's the system they came from.
[01:48:41.251 --> 01:48:41.791]  It's over!
[01:48:43.872 --> 01:48:47.034]  And the Feds and the Globalists want that because it will bankrupt the economy.
[01:48:47.114 --> 01:48:49.776]  So they lie and claim they've got to pay $5,000.
[01:48:49.816 --> 01:48:54.059]  They lie and claim they've got to leave the country under the deal and then come back under Visa.
[01:48:54.299 --> 01:48:56.260]  No, the Senators are on record saying, no, we've seen it.
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:57.681]  We've seen the secret bill.
[01:48:57.881 --> 01:48:59.042]  There's a reason it's secret.
[01:48:59.482 --> 01:49:00.503]  They're keeping it secret.
[01:49:00.523 --> 01:49:01.704]  They're trying to vote on it today.
[01:49:02.084 --> 01:49:03.325]  They announced a deal last week.
[01:49:03.345 --> 01:49:05.446]  They're telling you it ends the illegal alien problem.
[01:49:05.747 --> 01:49:07.027]  They've got fake neocons.
[01:49:07.067 --> 01:49:10.690]  I heard one last night on the radio saying, yeah, this will fix the illegal alien problem.
[01:49:10.970 --> 01:49:12.211]  They're bald-faced liars!
[01:49:14.958 --> 01:49:15.799]  It's amnesty!
[01:49:16.019 --> 01:49:16.559]  Period!
[01:49:20.101 --> 01:49:22.303]  But it's more than just amnesty.
[01:49:25.665 --> 01:49:32.750]  It allows unlimited skilled and unskilled workers to be visaed by Fortune 500 if they request.
[01:49:33.210 --> 01:49:36.893]  It's the same bill they've had four times in the last six years.
[01:49:38.033 --> 01:49:38.594]  This is it.
[01:49:39.394 --> 01:49:40.175]  We're facing it.
[01:49:40.971 --> 01:49:49.993]  It's a secret bill, just like the NAFTA highways, just like the Patriot Act, just like the Federal Reserve Act, it's always secret.
[01:49:50.593 --> 01:49:53.413]  And now we know the details, it's total amnesty and they're saying it's not.
[01:49:56.694 --> 01:50:02.175]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.535 --> 01:50:10.176]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.876 --> 01:50:17.939]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.319 --> 01:50:29.744]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.064 --> 01:50:33.646]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.986 --> 01:50:35.947]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.287 --> 01:50:40.129]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.266 --> 01:50:58.350]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:58.410 --> 01:51:05.716]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:05.876 --> 01:51:16.504]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:16.704 --> 01:51:21.248]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:21.528 --> 01:51:26.513]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:51:26.733 --> 01:51:29.676]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:29.896 --> 01:51:39.565]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:51:53.283 --> 01:51:54.984]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:55.204 --> 01:51:58.905]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:59.245 --> 01:52:08.169]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:08.329 --> 01:52:13.211]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.311 --> 01:52:13.972]  We're good to go.
[01:52:32.204 --> 01:52:35.325]  There's no software to load, and it's so easy to install.

[01:52:54.329 --> 01:53:00.930]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:17.694 --> 01:53:21.535]  I've got huge news blitzes coming up in the next hour.
[01:53:23.256 --> 01:53:27.397]  We've got the list of Bilderberg attendees for 2007 from Daniel Estalon.
[01:53:27.417 --> 01:53:29.238]  This just went up on JonesReport.com.
[01:53:29.318 --> 01:53:30.278]  It is exclusive.
[01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:34.332]  I've got about five or six other exclusive stories.
[01:53:34.372 --> 01:53:36.433]  We've got Ron Paul's press conference.
[01:53:36.734 --> 01:53:44.600]  We've got his entire speech that he gave locally here in Austin that the state was saying was in that building that no one was allowed to record.
[01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:46.301]  This isn't Russia, okay?
[01:53:46.321 --> 01:53:46.962]  Just shut up!
[01:53:47.002 --> 01:53:47.702]  We're going to air it.
[01:53:48.043 --> 01:53:49.964]  Stop telling us we're a bunch of slaves.
[01:53:50.004 --> 01:53:51.025]  Stop treating us like that.
[01:53:51.045 --> 01:53:57.170]  It's like cops coming up on the street corner in New York or Dallas, Texas and telling people, you can't videotape here.
[01:53:57.210 --> 01:53:58.131]  Turn your cameras off.
[01:53:59.557 --> 01:54:05.500]  I was just last night reviewing video that Rob, when he was up in New York visiting family a few months ago, shot some more U.N.
[01:54:05.540 --> 01:54:06.141]  shots for us.
[01:54:06.181 --> 01:54:11.783]  He's on a sidewalk, starts videotaping for about a minute with a tripod, and the cops pull up and tell him he can't videotape.
[01:54:12.304 --> 01:54:14.025]  That's what America's turned into, folks!
[01:54:14.285 --> 01:54:17.987]  Just goons walking around, treating us like we're all criminals!
[01:54:18.407 --> 01:54:20.488]  You're the criminals when you act like that!
[01:54:20.508 --> 01:54:21.489]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[01:54:22.329 --> 01:54:23.109]  It's all coming up.
[01:54:23.410 --> 01:54:25.951]  And I'm gonna get to
[01:54:27.629 --> 01:54:33.033]  Sasha and everybody else, David and others, that are patiently holding.
[01:54:33.093 --> 01:54:39.558]  I've got National Security Decision Directive 51, which was the setup for martial law two weeks ago.
[01:54:40.379 --> 01:54:42.900]  We've mentioned this, but I could talk for five hours about this.
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:44.061]  I mean, it's so terrifying.
[01:54:44.882 --> 01:54:45.863]  It's just everything.
[01:54:46.003 --> 01:54:49.125]  I am literally wallowing in this.
[01:54:49.505 --> 01:54:53.008]  It's like we're being attacked from a thousand sides, and how do you even chronicle it all?
[01:54:53.991 --> 01:54:55.832]  Just know this, our government is not our government.
[01:54:56.232 --> 01:54:58.613]  It's totally bought and paid for, and they're making their move right now.
[01:54:58.633 --> 01:54:59.454]  Aaron Russo's right.
[01:55:00.394 --> 01:55:07.697]  But we're making our move too, with Ron Paul, and fighting the open borders, and the Second Amendment, and people waking up to 9-11 truth.
[01:55:07.757 --> 01:55:08.918]  The country is waking up.
[01:55:09.358 --> 01:55:13.520]  We always said when the globalists made their move, it would be completely obvious and everybody would wake up.
[01:55:15.091 --> 01:55:21.273]  I'm going to cover first when we get back, because I've got to get to it, this North American Union story saying it doesn't exist and we're all kook liars.
[01:55:21.713 --> 01:55:32.975]  But I just hope that you will also expose the hoax of a lie that this isn't an amnesty program, and they've got a few illegal alien groups out saying, oh, we don't like this, and Pelosi says she doesn't like it.
[01:55:33.556 --> 01:55:35.216]  That's all done to fool you.
[01:55:35.736 --> 01:55:37.857]  Oh, the Democrats are against it, it must be good.
[01:55:38.217 --> 01:55:42.858]  If you actually look, it's the Democrats pushing it, and Ted Kennedy wrote the bill in secret.
[01:55:43.473 --> 01:55:46.956]  And you watch, Pelosi, when it comes time for a vote, is going to vote for it.
[01:55:47.256 --> 01:55:50.199]  They're playing games with you.
[01:55:50.499 --> 01:55:51.700]  They're decoying you.
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:58.265]  If you learn military tactics and just apply it to this, you'll see everything they're doing is done militarily.
[01:55:58.966 --> 01:56:01.148]  Do you understand that?
[01:56:01.994 --> 01:56:03.335]  It's all military.
[01:56:03.755 --> 01:56:05.216]  It's military propaganda.
[01:56:05.857 --> 01:56:07.818]  And they do the same stuff over and over again.
[01:56:08.358 --> 01:56:20.366]  All we have to do is assess them as Tokyo Roses, assess them as the enemy, as the counterfeit, and we can remove them and go off the true blueprint, the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence.
[01:56:22.428 --> 01:56:25.350]  Now I'm going to end this hour, and I'm going to come back and
[01:56:26.928 --> 01:56:31.452]  What we'll do is we'll take a few calls, then I'll get into the North American Union, then I'll spend the rest of the time with Ron Paul.
[01:56:31.472 --> 01:56:32.112]  That's what we're going to do.
[01:56:32.633 --> 01:56:34.834]  On the Ron Paul clips that, again, are virgin.
[01:56:34.874 --> 01:56:35.675]  Nobody's heard these yet.
[01:56:35.975 --> 01:56:38.057]  Well, I guess if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, you've seen them.
[01:56:38.277 --> 01:56:38.978]  They're out there right now.
[01:56:38.998 --> 01:56:43.201]  You can watch some of the YouTube clips of it right now at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:56:43.521 --> 01:56:54.990]  Before I end this hour, if you believe in what we're doing, fighting tooth and nail, then literally charge up our battery, put more fuel in our tank, and you do that by buying the books and videos at InfoWars.com.
[01:56:55.641 --> 01:57:01.265]  Literally, folks, we're a big ol' locomotive going over the side at full speed against the New World Order.
[01:57:01.505 --> 01:57:07.608]  I am literally got my hair on fire driving this thing, and I just need you there just shoveling it in there, folks.
[01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:10.830]  I mean, because it's a collision.
[01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:14.152]  Here comes the enemy train, and we're on the collision course with the train.
[01:57:14.473 --> 01:57:15.313]  We don't have a choice.
[01:57:15.333 --> 01:57:16.634]  We've got to broadside them.
[01:57:16.954 --> 01:57:18.955]  We've got to go head-on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:19.816 --> 01:57:21.897]  And I'm telling you, just go by the books and videos.
[01:57:21.917 --> 01:57:24.939]  Just shovel that coal right into that furnace.
[01:57:26.011 --> 01:57:30.536]  Oh yeah, just get those wheels turning even faster!
[01:57:33.739 --> 01:57:38.764]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.944 --> 01:57:50.564]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.245 --> 01:57:52.325]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.005 --> 01:57:54.145]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.765 --> 01:57:55.585]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.346 --> 01:57:57.266]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.906 --> 01:58:01.567]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.087 --> 01:58:06.207]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.088 --> 01:58:08.448]  Welcome.
[01:58:08.548 --> 01:58:11.128]  It is now hour number three already.
[01:58:11.148 --> 01:58:14.629]  We will air the rest of Ron Paul's press conference, then his speech in its entirety.
[01:58:15.370 --> 01:58:19.713]  And then we are also going to take a few more of your calls when we get into the North American Union story.
[01:58:19.733 --> 01:58:22.255]  A little bit more on the blanket amnesty they're trying to pass.
[01:58:22.675 --> 01:58:25.177]  But the good news is they tried to bar Ron Paul from the debates.
[01:58:25.237 --> 01:58:26.218]  That blew up in their face.
[01:58:26.538 --> 01:58:28.939]  They're trying to get amnesty for the fourth time in six years.
[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:30.801]  They're trying to be deceptive and lie about it.
[01:58:30.841 --> 01:58:31.962]  That's blowing up in their face.
[01:58:32.522 --> 01:58:33.703]  Nobody's for their war.
[01:58:34.123 --> 01:58:38.586]  Everything the new old order touches is turning to garbage.
[01:58:38.766 --> 01:58:41.128]  It's just, they don't have the might to touch anymore.
[01:58:41.887 --> 01:58:44.049]  And they know they're losing the initiative.
[01:58:44.269 --> 01:58:46.911]  The people are figuring out that the enemy is not invincible.
[01:58:47.491 --> 01:58:49.033]  With God's help, we're going to win this thing.
[01:58:49.773 --> 01:58:54.717]  Let's go ahead and go to David in California, then Sasha in St.
[01:58:54.757 --> 01:58:54.997]  Louis.
[01:58:55.017 --> 01:58:56.058]  Get those calls out of the way.
[01:58:56.078 --> 01:58:56.739]  Go ahead, David.
[01:58:56.759 --> 01:58:58.460]  Hi, Alex.
[01:58:58.540 --> 01:58:59.060]  David here.
[01:58:59.701 --> 01:59:11.510]  Yeah, the thing that comes to mind, I think, the most out of the last few years or since Bush was put into the House, is don't believe us and don't believe your eyes.
[01:59:12.581 --> 01:59:16.304]  It just keeps popping back up in their face.
[01:59:16.365 --> 01:59:18.747]  There's no NAFTA highway.
[01:59:19.047 --> 01:59:21.049]  There's no North American Union.
[01:59:21.069 --> 01:59:23.931]  There's no troops dying in Iraq.
[01:59:24.592 --> 01:59:26.093]  Halliburton's not corrupt.
[01:59:26.794 --> 01:59:27.814]  Bush doesn't lie.
[01:59:27.854 --> 01:59:29.276]  We don't torture, but we do.
[01:59:30.464 --> 01:59:31.765]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:59:31.965 --> 01:59:45.455]  And if you really want to see things written down and really put them in their face, go to dubiousware.com and you can purchase my t-shirts there and wake up your neighbors.
[01:59:45.915 --> 01:59:55.622]  I've been sitting on the fence for too long, Alex, and you're definitely somebody I listen to every day and I believe in what you say.
[01:59:57.412 --> 01:59:58.512]  Well that's good my friend.
[01:59:58.532 --> 02:00:00.133]  Keep it up and I appreciate your call.
[02:00:00.513 --> 02:00:02.134]  Sasha in St.
[02:00:02.174 --> 02:00:02.474]  Louis.
[02:00:02.494 --> 02:00:03.634]  You're on the air Sasha.
[02:00:03.654 --> 02:00:04.054]  Go ahead.
[02:00:04.755 --> 02:00:05.775]  Good afternoon Mr. Jones.
[02:00:06.015 --> 02:00:06.275]  Hi.
[02:00:07.296 --> 02:00:08.956]  This is an atrocity here written by the St.
[02:00:08.976 --> 02:00:09.857]  Louis Post-Dispatch.
[02:00:10.357 --> 02:00:11.577]  A pack of lies at the least.
[02:00:12.057 --> 02:00:13.158]  Now we're going to cover that next.
[02:00:13.198 --> 02:00:13.958]  Go ahead and get into it.
[02:00:14.678 --> 02:00:20.921]  Well I called specifically to get into the military strategy that's being used to consolidate the North American Union.
[02:00:22.648 --> 02:00:27.831]  Just in order to counter an article that's just really a pack of lies, I'd like to talk some truth into this.
[02:00:28.931 --> 02:00:37.696]  What I see that they're doing is using an old Boer War tactic used by a man named Alfred Milner V. Conte of the English.
[02:00:38.796 --> 02:00:44.359]  Sure, you're talking about the Dutch and the British fighting with each other, with the Zulus involved in South Africa.
[02:00:44.819 --> 02:00:45.340]  Absolutely.
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:50.082]  And what he did is he had a bunch of his English citizens
[02:00:50.498 --> 02:00:54.681]  In his neighbor's countries, invaded them in order to liberate his ignorant citizens.
[02:00:55.802 --> 02:00:57.022]  Now this is a reverse of that.
[02:00:57.343 --> 02:01:08.270]  We're importing our neighbor's citizens and granting them super citizenship to end the normal citizenship that exists here, which includes our Bill of Rights, includes our Constitution.
[02:01:08.835 --> 02:01:10.097]  And the Declaration of Independence.
[02:01:10.338 --> 02:01:12.521]  Oh yeah, no no, it's Imperial Divide and Conquer.
[02:01:12.541 --> 02:01:17.910]  Look, the Battle for Gaul written by Julius Caesar is they took in the Austriagoths.
[02:01:17.950 --> 02:01:20.434]  The Austrians had been co-opted a long time before.
[02:01:21.204 --> 02:01:23.725]  And we're basically the same genetic line as the Romans.
[02:01:23.765 --> 02:01:26.386]  The Romans in the past really looked like Austrians.
[02:01:26.946 --> 02:01:28.846]  They've been invaded by the Turks and others have taken over.
[02:01:28.866 --> 02:01:32.787]  That's why the Italian complexion, at least from the south down, is different.
[02:01:32.968 --> 02:01:35.008]  But regardless, they were a Germanic group.
[02:01:35.228 --> 02:01:36.229]  The Romans were Germanic.
[02:01:36.829 --> 02:01:47.732]  And they teamed up with the Austriagods, who were their main front line going in against the Germans in Germania and the Gauls, which were the French and who were Germanic.
[02:01:48.559 --> 02:01:55.101]  And so they were constantly doing that, always importing a new group and then exporting against the next.
[02:01:56.141 --> 02:01:56.701]  Absolutely.
[02:01:56.741 --> 02:01:58.922]  And Miller, incidentally, was German-born.
[02:02:00.722 --> 02:02:01.642]  Interesting.
[02:02:01.662 --> 02:02:02.843]  Tell us more about the Boer War.
[02:02:02.883 --> 02:02:04.223]  I know that they did do that.
[02:02:04.263 --> 02:02:14.726]  Well, basically it was just a mass migration of Europeans to that area because it was an old Dutch settlement from the 1600s and they were just trying to exploit the resources there.
[02:02:16.094 --> 02:02:16.515]  Absolutely.
[02:02:16.535 --> 02:02:18.056]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:02:18.076 --> 02:02:20.458]  I want to use you to introduce this, because you're in St.
[02:02:20.478 --> 02:02:20.678]  Louis.
[02:02:20.718 --> 02:02:21.138]  This is a St.
[02:02:21.158 --> 02:02:21.879]  Louis Post-Dispatch article.
[02:02:21.899 --> 02:02:25.522]  Definitely government propaganda, because it's in every paper in the country that I've seen.
[02:02:25.542 --> 02:02:26.102]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:48.582 --> 02:02:54.048]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.408 --> 02:03:02.056]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.754 --> 02:03:09.797]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.197 --> 02:03:21.642]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.922 --> 02:03:25.543]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.903 --> 02:03:27.824]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.164 --> 02:03:32.006]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:05:19.724 --> 02:05:20.464]  We're good to go.
[02:05:46.664 --> 02:05:52.689]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.289 --> 02:05:56.331]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.112 --> 02:06:06.539]  I'm gonna get into a national hit piece, a concerted effort to claim there's no plan to set up a North American Union, no NAFTA highways, no Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:06:06.559 --> 02:06:12.403]  I mean, they're building the thing, announcing it on our news here, and there's national stories saying it doesn't exist.
[02:06:13.459 --> 02:06:14.541]  I mean, these people are incredible.
[02:06:14.921 --> 02:06:17.966]  So that's coming up and I'm going to cover exclusively Ron Paul.
[02:06:18.968 --> 02:06:21.231]  But I wanted Sasha and St.
[02:06:21.271 --> 02:06:25.297]  Louis to be able to finish up because he specifically called in about the article we're about to cover.
[02:06:25.317 --> 02:06:26.719]  We'll go to Sasha in one moment.
[02:06:27.260 --> 02:06:28.182]  First off, folks,
[02:06:29.207 --> 02:06:31.768]  I've known about Researched Herbs for a long time.
[02:06:31.848 --> 02:06:37.650]  It is one of the premier big online herbs and vitamins and mineral sites.
[02:06:38.210 --> 02:06:50.755]  And this is where they really go for the stuff that has been researched, that has been proven, that has really shown incredible properties to help you on so many issues of nutrition and health.
[02:06:51.475 --> 02:06:54.857]  And they've got big write-ups and sections on each of the products they carry.
[02:06:54.877 --> 02:06:57.057]  Many products that they pioneered.
[02:06:57.117 --> 02:07:02.900]  We have banners up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com for ResearchedHerbs.com.
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:04.900]  It's just ResearchedHerbs.com.
[02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:05.741]  That's the website.
[02:07:06.121 --> 02:07:08.062]  Or give them a call and get their catalog at 1-800-845-3841.
[02:07:08.122 --> 02:07:08.322]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[02:07:17.137 --> 02:07:18.298]  We're good to go!
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:43.522]  It has been endorsed by over 200,000 healthcare professionals.
[02:07:44.163 --> 02:07:46.666]  It's a registered drug in over 45 countries.
[02:07:47.086 --> 02:07:50.930]  It's been clinically proven to be very beneficial to the liver in serious liver diseases.
[02:07:51.310 --> 02:07:53.092]  It's great for just general liver function.
[02:07:53.412 --> 02:07:55.354]  The liver really is one of the key organs of the body.
[02:07:55.374 --> 02:07:57.797]  It was the second biggest organ after the skin.
[02:07:59.743 --> 02:08:04.746]  1-800-845-3841 or researchedherbs.com.
[02:08:04.766 --> 02:08:06.646]  We'll tell you more about Researched Herbs in the future.
[02:08:06.707 --> 02:08:09.968]  Okay, I'm about to get back to Sasha the Caller in St.
[02:08:10.028 --> 02:08:16.051]  Louis in this incredible article here that is in the St.
[02:08:16.091 --> 02:08:16.991]  Louis Post-Dispatch.
[02:08:17.011 --> 02:08:19.653]  The reason I'm covering this is it was in hundreds of papers.
[02:08:20.093 --> 02:08:21.093]  Now, I don't know that.
[02:08:21.173 --> 02:08:26.416]  I mean, to be specific, I saw it six times last week and over the weekend in different major papers.
[02:08:27.054 --> 02:08:38.721]  Then I started going to random Google and typing in the headline with the name of big papers after it and found it on all of the six or so papers I checked.
[02:08:39.261 --> 02:08:42.783]  When I see that, and it was outside of syndicates that the St.
[02:08:42.823 --> 02:08:44.304]  Louis Post-Dispatch is normally in.
[02:08:44.884 --> 02:08:50.107]  When I see that, and I see it simultaneously, it means there was a big push to put this out as propaganda.
[02:08:51.627 --> 02:08:53.449]  Hey Alex, how are you doing buddy?
[02:08:53.469 --> 02:08:55.351]  I just wanted to call and tell you that
[02:09:12.068 --> 02:09:15.451]  You did a great job the other day with the Ron Paul situation.
[02:09:15.511 --> 02:09:20.014]  Well, you did, too, getting your 50,000 volunteers or 60,000 to take action.
[02:09:20.054 --> 02:09:21.135]  We all did it together.
[02:09:21.695 --> 02:09:24.838]  It's the listeners, I mean, not me, but thanks, Aaron, who did it.
[02:09:24.858 --> 02:09:26.379]  That's what I mean.
[02:09:26.479 --> 02:09:29.481]  It's all of us working together, creating a synergistic effort.
[02:09:29.521 --> 02:09:30.342]  Exactly, my friend.
[02:09:30.622 --> 02:09:32.583]  And that's what we have to continue to keep doing.
[02:09:32.683 --> 02:09:34.805]  And I was very, very happy to see that.
[02:09:35.265 --> 02:09:36.326]  I was so upset.
[02:09:37.167 --> 02:09:41.310]  And you just did a great job, the listeners did a great job, and I want to thank everybody
[02:09:41.963 --> 02:09:47.788]  Who called in, sent emails, and kept Ron Paul in the debate.
[02:09:47.868 --> 02:09:49.430]  It's obviously critical for us.
[02:09:50.450 --> 02:09:53.553]  And they were talking about him again today on The View.
[02:09:53.573 --> 02:10:00.619]  And discussing that Bush called Jimmy Carter and Ron Paul irrelevant.
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:03.922]  And I thought that was kind of fascinating.
[02:10:03.942 --> 02:10:05.924]  So Ron's name is starting to come up a lot more.
[02:10:06.607 --> 02:10:08.811]  And I did speak with Ron the other day, by the way.
[02:10:08.831 --> 02:10:10.233]  I guess it was Thursday afternoon.
[02:10:10.273 --> 02:10:12.216]  Yeah, we've got him coming on next Tuesday.
[02:10:12.236 --> 02:10:12.677]  Great.
[02:10:13.098 --> 02:10:13.498]  I'm good.
[02:10:13.678 --> 02:10:14.360]  How is he doing?
[02:10:14.941 --> 02:10:15.742]  Ron's doing great.
[02:10:16.454 --> 02:10:17.835]  And that's what I want to tell you.
[02:10:17.855 --> 02:10:18.276]  I spoke to him.
[02:10:18.296 --> 02:10:20.437]  He said he was going to get a hold of you to get on the show.
[02:10:20.457 --> 02:10:22.058]  So I guess he's already done that.
[02:10:22.078 --> 02:10:23.379]  So I wanted to inform you of that.
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:24.660]  You know, it was because of you.
[02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:26.502]  I couldn't get through his campaign, people.
[02:10:26.862 --> 02:10:29.384]  And then they called this morning and said, yes, sir, he wants to come on.
[02:10:29.924 --> 02:10:30.525]  We talked to him.
[02:10:30.545 --> 02:10:32.406]  He said your show's the biggest response he gets.
[02:10:32.486 --> 02:10:36.469]  And then I said, well, he's in Congress this week.
[02:10:36.489 --> 02:10:37.550]  Let's just get him on next week.
[02:10:38.011 --> 02:10:38.311]  Right.
[02:10:38.671 --> 02:10:39.332]  Yeah.
[02:10:39.352 --> 02:10:45.096]  When I told him what he said, he said, no, I want to, you know, I'll call Alex and we'll get on the show right away and do it.
[02:10:45.875 --> 02:10:49.837]  He loves the show, he loves the people, and he's our guy.
[02:10:49.857 --> 02:10:57.800]  Yeah, he's just got all new staff, new campaign folks, and we've got to get acquainted with them just so they know how stuff is.
[02:10:58.060 --> 02:11:00.341]  It's growing pains, you know, it's all growing pains.
[02:11:00.381 --> 02:11:09.765]  So I just wanted to let you know that I did speak to Ron, and that was going to happen, but you know that already, and I just wanted to tell the audience that I thank them from the bottom of my heart for doing what they did.
[02:11:09.785 --> 02:11:14.867]  To all the volunteers on America Free Enterprises, and we've sent them their emails and their
[02:11:16.147 --> 02:11:20.370]  And I'll just tell you, we have a victory here, and we have to keep having victories.
[02:11:20.930 --> 02:11:21.550]  It's critical.
[02:11:21.650 --> 02:11:31.756]  Aaron, before I forget, can I have my producer call you on your cell right now and set you up for tomorrow in the third hour, or will that not work?
[02:11:32.036 --> 02:11:36.919]  Well, I don't have a cell, so I don't keep a cell phone, but you can call me on the house phone.
[02:11:36.959 --> 02:11:37.800]  You have the number there.
[02:11:40.461 --> 02:11:43.483]  I guess it's your wife I always get on the cell then.
[02:11:44.073 --> 02:11:44.493]  What's that?
[02:11:44.853 --> 02:11:47.634]  I guess it's your wife, Heidi, I always get on the cell.
[02:11:47.654 --> 02:11:49.255]  Yeah, you get Heidi on the cell.
[02:11:49.635 --> 02:11:50.975]  But no, I mean, I don't have a cell phone.
[02:11:51.075 --> 02:11:51.655]  I don't keep them.
[02:11:52.475 --> 02:11:52.775]  I hear you.
[02:11:52.796 --> 02:11:53.456]  They're bad news.
[02:11:53.736 --> 02:12:00.778]  Well, listen, I will definitely, as soon as he gets the message, I'll have my producer call you in the next few minutes, Aaron.
[02:12:00.798 --> 02:12:02.798]  Let's set you up tomorrow in the third hour.
[02:12:02.818 --> 02:12:03.539]  You'll be up to that?
[02:12:03.559 --> 02:12:03.759]  Okay.
[02:12:04.139 --> 02:12:05.699]  Yeah, I'm always up to talk to you.
[02:12:05.719 --> 02:12:06.159]  You know that.
[02:12:06.299 --> 02:12:06.759]  You're awesome.
[02:12:06.799 --> 02:12:07.720]  Let's do it tomorrow, Aaron.
[02:12:07.740 --> 02:12:08.760]  We'll talk to you then, my friend.
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:10.060]  Let me ask you one question.
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:10.360]  Sure.
[02:12:10.681 --> 02:12:12.001]  Are you going to be on The View this week?
[02:12:13.590 --> 02:12:15.411]  No, the loose change guys are on.
[02:12:15.471 --> 02:12:15.712]  Why?
[02:12:16.192 --> 02:12:17.193]  What are they on, you know?
[02:12:18.814 --> 02:12:20.355]  You know, they've been trying to call me.
[02:12:20.375 --> 02:12:26.819]  Uh, Rosie announced they were on this Thursday, but then when I talked to them last Friday on air, they said, no, no, no, it'll be the next week.
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:28.300]  Uh, so I don't know.
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:30.582]  I need to call them, but I know they're on this week or next week.
[02:12:31.022 --> 02:12:38.447]  Uh, so I want somebody to say hello to Rosie for me and give her a, give her a copy of the DVD or the Freedom to Fascism DVD.
[02:12:39.548 --> 02:12:42.010]  That's a good idea, but I can tell you right now, Aaron, she's seen it.
[02:12:43.365 --> 02:12:51.364]  Yeah, she saw Terror Storm woke her up last September and then she saw American Freedom to Fascism about a month ago.
[02:12:51.974 --> 02:12:52.414]  Oh, she did?
[02:12:52.454 --> 02:12:52.774]  Okay.
[02:12:53.214 --> 02:12:57.476]  Because I know Rosie from years ago, and I haven't heard from her, so I didn't know she'd seen it.
[02:12:57.516 --> 02:12:58.516]  Well, I'll get a message to her.
[02:12:58.536 --> 02:13:00.557]  I'm able to talk to her via email, and that's about it.
[02:13:00.957 --> 02:13:02.017]  Yeah, okay.
[02:13:02.097 --> 02:13:03.818]  But I will get the message to her.
[02:13:04.278 --> 02:13:04.738]  Fantastic.
[02:13:04.758 --> 02:13:07.079]  And I'll tell her to give you a call, but you know, she's just so hammered.
[02:13:07.459 --> 02:13:07.879]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[02:13:07.899 --> 02:13:08.299]  I understand.
[02:13:08.339 --> 02:13:09.119]  That's what you all are.
[02:13:09.540 --> 02:13:10.940]  So I'll talk to you tomorrow.
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:11.660]  I'll talk to you tomorrow.
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:12.040]  Alright.
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:12.901]  God bless, my friend.
[02:13:13.061 --> 02:13:13.661]  You too, buddy.
[02:13:13.821 --> 02:13:14.081]  You bet.
[02:13:15.174 --> 02:13:18.595]  There goes Aaron Russo, popping into the show to congratulate everybody.
[02:13:18.615 --> 02:13:22.796]  Yes, you do deserve a congratulation on that, but don't think that the neocons are down for a minute.
[02:13:24.037 --> 02:13:26.238]  I mean, they may be down, but they're not out, I meant to say.
[02:13:26.798 --> 02:13:29.319]  They're going to be sneaking around, trying all sorts of tricks.
[02:13:29.899 --> 02:13:32.500]  You're going to see all sorts of dirt coming out about Ron Paul.
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:33.620]  Of course, it'll all be made up.
[02:13:34.835 --> 02:13:36.336]  The guy's like a monk or something.
[02:13:36.697 --> 02:13:38.778]  I know a lot of people that know him.
[02:13:39.219 --> 02:13:40.880]  I knew his staff for years.
[02:13:41.521 --> 02:13:48.126]  I helped campaign for him a little bit in 1995 when he ran for Congress again in 1996.
[02:13:49.547 --> 02:13:52.610]  Jeff Dice, I used to call him and say, I was listening to the show today.
[02:13:52.710 --> 02:13:54.812]  Me and the Congressman like to listen during lunch.
[02:13:55.352 --> 02:13:56.753]  So, I mean, Mont Paul listens to the show.
[02:13:56.813 --> 02:14:01.057]  He's that type of on the team, and that's why we're on his team.
[02:14:01.915 --> 02:14:10.079]  And I don't remember why I got off into that whole subject, but it's just that Ron Paul is an absolute treasure, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:10.839 --> 02:14:16.321]  Let's go ahead now and let Sasha and St.
[02:14:16.361 --> 02:14:16.982]  Louis finish up.
[02:14:17.342 --> 02:14:18.842]  Yeah, the St.
[02:14:18.862 --> 02:14:21.384]  Louis Post-Dispatch put this travesty out.
[02:14:21.404 --> 02:14:22.124]  You want to comment on it?
[02:14:22.144 --> 02:14:24.685]  Well, it's a very thorough travesty.
[02:14:25.125 --> 02:14:26.346]  It really makes me think that they're
[02:14:27.296 --> 02:14:32.858]  At least terrified at everything that is known and or widely published online right now.
[02:14:35.739 --> 02:14:36.219]  They are.
[02:14:36.420 --> 02:14:37.760]  When you read it, I mean, what did you think?
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:41.582]  I was surprised that they put so much out in one piece.
[02:14:41.722 --> 02:14:47.784]  I mean, when it comes down to it, it might blow up in their face, just like Giuliani's little huff and puffy moment against Ron Paul.
[02:14:48.775 --> 02:14:50.577]  Absolutely, I appreciate your comments on that.
[02:14:50.617 --> 02:14:54.161]  Let me get into it now because I've got two Ron Paul clips to cover and a lot more.
[02:14:54.601 --> 02:14:58.486]  Urban legend of North American Union feeds on fears.
[02:14:59.106 --> 02:15:01.289]  Now this appeared in every newspaper I looked at.
[02:15:01.489 --> 02:15:02.650]  Okay, this is massive.
[02:15:02.730 --> 02:15:04.652]  I never see coverage like this.
[02:15:05.093 --> 02:15:06.254]  I mean, this is everywhere.
[02:15:07.882 --> 02:15:11.524]  Forget the conspiracy theories about JFK's assassination.
[02:15:11.964 --> 02:15:13.986]  Now, 90-plus percent of the government did it.
[02:15:14.266 --> 02:15:16.827]  Top FBI agents just went public saying it was an inside job.
[02:15:17.148 --> 02:15:19.089]  We now have E. Howard Hunt's deathbed confession.
[02:15:19.109 --> 02:15:19.829]  They're running the op.
[02:15:20.409 --> 02:15:25.933]  Forget the conspiracy theories about JFK's assassination, the black helicopter, September 11th, and any others.
[02:15:26.293 --> 02:15:27.073]  This is the big one.
[02:15:27.514 --> 02:15:29.735]  As big, in fact, as the entire continent.
[02:15:31.664 --> 02:15:37.906]  And they go on to lie congenitally and say there's no North American Union, no NAFTA highways.
[02:15:38.566 --> 02:15:44.108]  Folks, I've spent a year on this new film, six months intensely reading it.
[02:15:44.928 --> 02:15:46.409]  It's got to be over 5,000 pages.
[02:15:47.269 --> 02:15:49.970]  There are so many maps, so many documents, so many admissions.
[02:15:51.611 --> 02:15:55.912]  It's just, it's mind-blowing that they just say it doesn't exist, just like this is an amnesty.
[02:15:57.461 --> 02:16:07.550]  We're talking about the secret plan to build a superhighway, a giant 10 to 12 lane production from the Yucatan to the Yukon with an immigration and trade center in Missouri.
[02:16:09.191 --> 02:16:22.082]  Well, yeah, that's the press conference and the corporate minutes that I just so happen to reread Friday night for over an hour at the Kansas City Inland Port website.
[02:16:22.122 --> 02:16:22.903]  It's not even hidden.
[02:16:24.002 --> 02:16:29.626]  Then I went to the City Council and read the official City Council pronouncements when they had the Mexican government there.
[02:16:30.827 --> 02:16:32.449]  But see, they just said it doesn't exist right there.
[02:16:32.469 --> 02:16:32.949]  It doesn't matter.
[02:16:32.969 --> 02:16:33.690]  We have the documents.
[02:16:34.410 --> 02:16:37.593]  People sit down with their coffee and read this and laugh at the tinfoil hat brigade.
[02:16:38.974 --> 02:16:40.855]  We're talking about the secret plan to build a superhighway.
[02:16:41.156 --> 02:16:42.296]  There's nothing secret about it.
[02:16:42.316 --> 02:16:44.118]  They got 83 of these things in the country.
[02:16:44.158 --> 02:16:47.200]  I got Federal Department of Transportation documents saying it.
[02:16:47.681 --> 02:16:49.722]  They're building the thing right now outside my town.
[02:16:50.463 --> 02:16:52.264]  I mean, again, I can't even cover this article.
[02:16:52.324 --> 02:16:53.085]  It's such lies.
[02:16:54.989 --> 02:17:05.176]  The Super Corridor is to allow the really big part of the plan to take place, the merging of the governments of Canada, the United States and Mexico, say goodbye to the dollar, and maybe even the English language.
[02:17:05.196 --> 02:17:05.637]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:17:05.917 --> 02:17:10.640]  The Council on Foreign Relations last week put out a report saying the end of national currencies.
[02:17:12.001 --> 02:17:15.184]  And they go on to say, well, the CFR does call for all this, but they don't run anything.
[02:17:15.744 --> 02:17:21.248]  No, they just rode up towards a North American Union document
[02:17:24.088 --> 02:17:31.455]  And, uh, towards the North American community, and it was word for word adopted as the SPP into law, by treaty.
[02:17:32.716 --> 02:17:33.596]  Look, I gotta cover this.
[02:17:33.616 --> 02:17:38.000]  We're gonna come back, go over this, and, uh, a lot more.
[02:17:39.161 --> 02:17:39.982]  And then we'll get into Ron Paul.
[02:17:46.181 --> 02:17:51.144]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:17:51.445 --> 02:17:56.888]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:17:56.928 --> 02:18:01.211]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:18:01.571 --> 02:18:04.573]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:18:04.874 --> 02:18:08.316]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:18:08.656 --> 02:18:17.999]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:18:18.259 --> 02:18:21.760]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:29.102]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[02:18:29.362 --> 02:18:30.723]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.
[02:18:30.763 --> 02:18:32.483]  Get two for $70 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:18:35.624 --> 02:18:38.225]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:18:38.365 --> 02:18:40.145]  On May 21st, 2007, Gold Spot, $6.5910 and 1 oz.
[02:18:40.185 --> 02:18:42.706]  gold coins can be purchased for $6.8044, $3.3575 for 1 oz., and $1.6788 for 1.25 oz.
[02:18:42.726 --> 02:18:43.086]  coins at $6.8044, $3.3575, and $1.6788.
[02:19:03.510 --> 02:19:09.252]  There has been talk coming from the Council of Foreign Relations of forming an American Union combining Canada, Mexico and the U.S.
[02:19:09.352 --> 02:19:10.753]  and erasing economic borders.
[02:19:10.973 --> 02:19:17.756]  Bush met with Vincent Fox, President of Mexico, Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, discussing a security and prosperity partnership.
[02:19:17.936 --> 02:19:21.498]  The formation of a North American Union will have a great impact on the U.S.
[02:19:21.538 --> 02:19:22.038]  economy.
[02:19:22.298 --> 02:19:27.020]  Jerome R. Corsi published the document, The Plan to Replace the Dollar with the Emerald.
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:28.681]  The sovereignty of the U.S.
[02:19:28.941 --> 02:19:29.641]  is under attack.
[02:19:30.121 --> 02:19:33.483]  And Corsi uncovers the secrets and lies that surround the deceit.

[02:19:36.465 --> 02:19:37.165]  That's 800-686-2237 That's 800-686-2237
[02:19:47.495 --> 02:19:51.616]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:19:51.856 --> 02:19:53.617]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:19:53.877 --> 02:20:00.159]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:20:00.459 --> 02:20:06.581]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:20:06.821 --> 02:20:12.843]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[02:20:13.143 --> 02:20:19.549]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[02:20:19.689 --> 02:20:23.233]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[02:20:23.533 --> 02:20:27.256]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.

[02:20:30.099 --> 02:20:31.160]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:20:31.320 --> 02:20:31.520]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[02:20:31.540 --> 02:20:31.600]  1-866-885-6625.

[02:20:39.026 --> 02:20:41.688]  Take it from me, Craig Walcott, producer of Exercise is Suicide.

[02:21:44.085 --> 02:21:44.485]  Do it now.
[02:21:49.668 --> 02:21:51.109]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:51.750 --> 02:21:56.893]  All over the country this article was run, Urban Legend of North American Union Feeds on Fears.
[02:21:58.914 --> 02:22:16.786]  And it goes on to say that the rumor is sweeping the internet, radio and magazines, spread by bloggers, broadcasters and writers who cite the proof in the writings of a respected American University professor and a task force put together by the Ultra Establishment Council on Foreign Relations and the workings of the U.S.
[02:22:16.846 --> 02:22:17.607]  Commerce Department.
[02:22:18.508 --> 02:22:21.910]  Now remember, we had the SPP meeting last year in Banff
[02:22:22.757 --> 02:22:31.222]  Canada, we got the minutes of it and they're talking about a North American Union and they talk about how to keep it secret and how to get a carbon tax in the continent.
[02:22:32.503 --> 02:22:47.551]  And then SPP was signed in secret two years ago plus in March of 2005 in Texas by Fox and Martin of Mexico and Canada with Bush and they're merging the military, the police, regulation, just like they set up the EU as a trade deal.
[02:22:48.737 --> 02:22:56.159]  But then they go on this article to say there's no North American Highway, there's no Superhighways, there's no Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:22:56.179 --> 02:22:59.280]  It goes on and on for page after page.
[02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:03.441]  And then they cite other people's articles and say that it doesn't show any proof.
[02:23:04.922 --> 02:23:06.882]  We've got to do a big debunking on this article.
[02:23:06.922 --> 02:23:09.183]  I've got Bob Daisy coming in tomorrow about it.
[02:23:10.692 --> 02:23:18.436]  Nobody's proposing a North American Union, says Robert A. Pastor, a professor at American University, to whom conspiracy theorists point to as the father of the NAU.
[02:23:18.836 --> 02:23:26.180]  They cite a 2001 book, Towards a North American Community, Lessons for the Old World, for the New World, as a basic text for the plan.
[02:23:27.281 --> 02:23:39.147]  They also point to his co-chairmanship of a Council on Foreign Relations task force that produced a 2005 report on cooperation among the three countries that was signed into executive law by Bush.
[02:23:41.235 --> 02:23:44.718]  There is no backwards rumor, no small-time concern.
[02:23:45.179 --> 02:23:51.665]  Google North American Union or the Internet, and you'll find 85,600,000 references as of Tuesday evening.
[02:23:52.065 --> 02:23:57.570]  When a Commerce Department official appeared on C-SPAN show a few weeks ago, most callers asked about the North American Union.
[02:23:57.590 --> 02:24:02.715]  You see, this is how they started the EU, and for 50 years said it didn't exist, folks.
[02:24:03.696 --> 02:24:05.918]  And then they said, oh, by the way, you don't have any rights, and it does.
[02:24:07.356 --> 02:24:10.478]  On one recent day alone, Pasteur said he got about 100 emails on the topic.
[02:24:10.498 --> 02:24:16.881]  They get turned on by CNN's Lou Dobbs, Bill O'Reilly, who are fearful that Mexicans and Canadians are about to take over our country.
[02:24:16.941 --> 02:24:17.841]  No, they're not taking over.
[02:24:18.041 --> 02:24:18.902]  The New World Order is.
[02:24:19.342 --> 02:24:26.165]  Pasteur said, adding, such claims are a product of the xenophobic or frightened right-wing of America that is afraid of immigration and globalization.
[02:24:27.032 --> 02:24:28.873]  Oh yeah, there's no 30 million illegals.
[02:24:28.893 --> 02:24:29.973]  We're not losing our jobs.
[02:24:30.413 --> 02:24:31.473]  Yeah, nothing's happening.
[02:24:31.793 --> 02:24:35.115]  There's not millions stomping around our streets with Mexican flags.
[02:24:35.495 --> 02:24:36.235]  Everything's fine.
[02:24:36.655 --> 02:24:43.537]  And they go on to say we're liars, and again, the highways don't exist, and none of it's happening.
[02:24:43.917 --> 02:24:47.678]  I mean, this thing is five pages of small type long.
[02:24:48.158 --> 02:24:49.799]  Tomorrow I will cover it in the first hour.
[02:24:49.839 --> 02:24:51.840]  This will be the first thing, unless there's some huge news story.
[02:24:52.060 --> 02:24:53.500]  I'm going to read the whole thing and analyze it.
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:56.281]  Paul Watson's going to do a piece, but we have to do a big one on this.
[02:24:57.930 --> 02:25:03.756]  All right, before we end this segment, I'm just going to tell you, we're going to come back and play five minutes left of the press conference.
[02:25:03.776 --> 02:25:06.298]  I'm going to air all I can of Ron Paul's 18-minute speech.
[02:25:06.618 --> 02:25:07.799]  We should get most of it in.
[02:25:09.901 --> 02:25:13.024]  I know if we cut out all the applauses, we could get it all in, but we don't.
[02:25:13.044 --> 02:25:14.826]  We'll air it tomorrow, but you just won't hear me anymore.
[02:25:14.846 --> 02:25:17.809]  It's going to be all Ron Paul when we get back.
[02:25:19.073 --> 02:25:22.515]  Please go to InfoWars.com and buy my videos.
[02:25:22.575 --> 02:25:23.595]  I've made 15 of them.
[02:25:23.635 --> 02:25:24.776]  Terror Storm is the newest.
[02:25:25.416 --> 02:25:26.656]  It's about to sell out.
[02:25:26.696 --> 02:25:28.177]  There won't be any more of the first edition.
[02:25:28.497 --> 02:25:33.399]  You get a signed card with each one you get from InfoWars.com or call 888-253-3139.

[02:25:56.567 --> 02:25:57.448]  Make them go viral.
[02:25:59.089 --> 02:26:00.990]  Right now there's a dig fight going on.
[02:26:01.010 --> 02:26:02.492]  There's a big dig battle going on.
[02:26:02.512 --> 02:26:07.235]  They're trying to dig us down off the main page of Dig, which again is hundreds of times bigger than the Drugs Report.
[02:26:07.596 --> 02:26:08.456]  That'll reach millions.
[02:26:08.496 --> 02:26:09.297]  Help us win that.
[02:26:10.433 --> 02:26:13.214]  And please get the books and videos, folks.
[02:26:13.234 --> 02:26:15.234]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:26:16.454 --> 02:26:19.155]  Before I go any further and end this segment, though, we've got a great new sponsor.
[02:26:20.095 --> 02:26:21.375]  Chilicene, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:26:22.315 --> 02:26:24.915]  This is an extremely urgent Prison Planet News Bulletin.
[02:26:24.955 --> 02:26:27.756]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, listen closely.
[02:26:28.136 --> 02:26:35.797]  Seventy-seven of my listeners are invited to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered by many to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[02:26:36.057 --> 02:26:37.378]  I did research on this first, folks.
[02:26:37.438 --> 02:26:38.698]  It really is an amazing
[02:26:40.038 --> 02:26:40.278]  Thank you.
[02:27:00.712 --> 02:27:03.935]  However, it is still legal to own this compound right now.
[02:27:04.636 --> 02:27:07.458]  They have some available to the listeners if you call.
[02:27:07.919 --> 02:27:08.800]  And let me give you the number.
[02:27:08.820 --> 02:27:09.480]  It is 877-327-0365.
[02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:09.580]  877-327-0365.
[02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:10.421]  Or blacklistedherbs.com.
[02:27:10.441 --> 02:27:11.562]  Blacklistedherbs.com.
[02:27:11.582 --> 02:27:11.623]  877-327-0365.
[02:27:23.514 --> 02:27:32.859]  We'll be right back with Ron Paul's press conference and his speech from Austin, Texas.
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:36.861]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.261 --> 02:27:38.862]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.762 --> 02:27:42.484]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.104 --> 02:27:50.388]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:27:50.628 --> 02:27:55.473]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:27:55.493 --> 02:27:57.094]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:27:57.234 --> 02:28:00.577]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Cal Bend Pure Soaps?
[02:28:00.858 --> 02:28:06.042]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[02:28:06.263 --> 02:28:12.028]  Marty Schachter founded Cal Bend Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[02:28:12.368 --> 02:28:14.790]  Now, CalBin soaps are available to you and me.
[02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:17.192]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[02:28:17.392 --> 02:28:19.554]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[02:28:19.834 --> 02:28:20.815]  No harsh chemicals.
[02:28:21.015 --> 02:28:21.956]  No animal testing.
[02:28:22.216 --> 02:28:23.537]  I use them and love them.
[02:28:23.557 --> 02:28:25.158]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:28:25.438 --> 02:28:26.559]  And I say it big time.
[02:28:26.839 --> 02:28:28.080]  Call CalBin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:28:28.100 --> 02:28:28.300]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[02:28:38.328 --> 02:28:44.851]  Again, that number 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:28:45.892 --> 02:28:52.835]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America by the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[02:28:54.095 --> 02:28:58.157]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[02:28:58.878 --> 02:29:05.901]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[02:29:06.801 --> 02:29:15.568]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.
[02:29:16.229 --> 02:29:21.313]  We'd like to offer you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:29:21.813 --> 02:29:22.294]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[02:29:22.314 --> 02:29:22.614]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:29:34.139 --> 02:29:35.101]  Just call today.
[02:29:35.221 --> 02:29:38.226]  Our operators are standing by to take your subscription.
[02:29:38.306 --> 02:29:39.628]  It's absolutely free.
[02:29:47.284 --> 02:29:54.108]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two books set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[02:29:54.488 --> 02:30:00.873]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[02:30:01.353 --> 02:30:11.259]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[02:30:11.740 --> 02:30:15.202]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[02:30:15.502 --> 02:30:18.204]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[02:30:18.825 --> 02:30:21.507]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.
[02:30:22.067 --> 02:30:23.988]  Send your check for $32 post-pay to Radio Liberty P.O.
[02:30:24.009 --> 02:30:24.729]  Box 969 Soquel, S-O-Q-U-E-L, California 95073.
[02:30:24.889 --> 02:30:27.591]  $32 to Radio Liberty Box 969 Soquel, California 95073.
[02:30:27.971 --> 02:30:28.752]  Or call 1-800-544-8927.
[02:30:28.772 --> 02:30:28.832]  1-800-544-8927.
[02:30:46.091 --> 02:30:55.698]  Since then, since the declaration of war on Iraq and Iran, what's spurred a lot of hatred towards the United States?
[02:30:55.778 --> 02:30:56.398]  No, no.
[02:30:56.579 --> 02:31:01.762]  The antagonism that contributed to this is our foreign policy of intervention.
[02:31:01.902 --> 02:31:07.026]  Occupation, being over there, having bombed Iraq for 10 years, having been in Iran.
[02:31:07.046 --> 02:31:10.288]  You know, we messed around with the Shah for 25 years, and he was a tyrant.
[02:31:10.328 --> 02:31:11.369]  He was our tyrant.
[02:31:12.369 --> 02:31:14.310]  And we had troops in Saudi Arabia.
[02:31:14.470 --> 02:31:15.831]  All these things contribute.
[02:31:15.851 --> 02:31:24.394]  The only real study of why people are willing to commit suicide terrorism was done by Robert Pape who came up with one conclusion.
[02:31:24.614 --> 02:31:27.075]  It was not radical religious beliefs.
[02:31:27.355 --> 02:31:28.416]  It was occupation.
[02:31:28.476 --> 02:31:32.357]  What would we do as Americans if China occupied this country?
[02:31:32.377 --> 02:31:33.958]  Do you think we would fight or not?
[02:31:34.318 --> 02:31:35.459]  And that's the way they see it.
[02:31:35.499 --> 02:31:37.679]  And we have to see it through their eyes as well.
[02:31:38.240 --> 02:31:41.461]  And our foreign policy has drifted from the foreign policy of the founders.
[02:31:42.041 --> 02:31:45.764]  The founder said, don't get involved in entangling alliances.
[02:31:45.904 --> 02:31:51.729]  Trade and talk with people and be friendly, but don't get involved and don't go around looking for monsters to destroy.
[02:31:52.270 --> 02:31:55.352]  And a foreign policy should be designed for the defense of this country.
[02:31:55.492 --> 02:31:58.275]  Unfortunately, the policy we have now makes us more vulnerable.
[02:31:58.835 --> 02:32:01.117]  And that's what I think should be done.
[02:32:01.157 --> 02:32:02.658]  That's not idealism!
[02:32:02.698 --> 02:32:04.239]  That's not idealism!
[02:32:11.937 --> 02:32:26.441]  Well, the very first thing I would do to sort of soften things that's going on there, within minutes, you could at least tell our aircraft carriers to start moving away from the shorelines of Iran, yelling and screaming and intimidating them.
[02:32:26.481 --> 02:32:27.882]  We have surrounded Iran now.
[02:32:27.942 --> 02:32:30.523]  We're getting ready to go to war against them, unfortunately.
[02:32:30.863 --> 02:32:35.904]  We're in a country to the east and a country to the west, and we're in the ocean, intimidating them.
[02:32:36.164 --> 02:32:38.285]  And I think, just move the ships back a little bit.
[02:32:38.305 --> 02:32:39.245]  Would you bring the troops home?
[02:32:39.505 --> 02:32:40.326]  Bring the troops home?
[02:32:40.546 --> 02:32:41.006]  Certainly.
[02:32:42.106 --> 02:32:51.854]  You know, you said that if we set a timetable for bringing the Super Bowl, that they'll sit out and wait.
[02:32:51.874 --> 02:32:53.495]  That's called a ceasefire.
[02:32:54.176 --> 02:33:01.121]  And I think the sooner they know that we are going to leave whenever it's reasonable, that there'll be a ceasefire, and they may even talk to each other.
[02:33:01.481 --> 02:33:02.962]  Maybe they'll come up with something.
[02:33:03.283 --> 02:33:06.085]  Just think how much peace there's been in Vietnam since we left.
[02:33:06.645 --> 02:33:07.686]  We're good to go.
[02:33:21.756 --> 02:33:24.758]  We're much better off than trying to impose our will on them.
[02:33:25.118 --> 02:33:28.561]  This actually didn't start with this administration, nor the previous administration.
[02:33:28.961 --> 02:33:31.503]  This has been smoldering for about a hundred years.
[02:33:31.543 --> 02:33:36.026]  It was Woodrow Wilson that said, we as great Americans will make the world safe for democracy.
[02:33:36.366 --> 02:33:41.889]  And look at what's happened since World War I. You've got some high-profile names, people up there, for the candidate for president.
[02:33:41.909 --> 02:33:43.771]  What do you think about the competition right now?
[02:33:44.991 --> 02:33:46.352]  Well, I haven't noticed any of them yet.
[02:33:51.116 --> 02:34:01.144]  It seems like they're fighting among themselves and they all have very conventional... I think they've dug themselves a hole because 70% of the American people now are sick of our foreign policy.
[02:34:01.164 --> 02:34:02.485]  They want a new... Yes!
[02:34:02.605 --> 02:34:03.365]  Amen!
[02:34:03.405 --> 02:34:11.752]  The Democrats have nothing to offer and all the other candidates, all the other Republican candidates say just dig in your heels, keep doing the same thing over and over again.
[02:34:12.072 --> 02:34:16.015]  As a physician, I was always taught, you know, if you make a wrong diagnosis, give the wrong treatment,
[02:34:16.375 --> 02:34:19.918]  Just doing more of the same doesn't help the patient.
[02:34:19.938 --> 02:34:23.260]  Why are you the only conservative running for the Republican Party?
[02:34:23.580 --> 02:34:26.823]  Well, I guess you'll have to ask the other ones why they're not conservative.
[02:34:27.283 --> 02:34:31.006]  Is there a plan for a New World Order, a One World Government, and how do we stop it?
[02:34:31.306 --> 02:34:37.731]  Well, I think even our first President Bush said that the New World Order was
[02:34:38.691 --> 02:34:41.194]  In tune, and that's what they were working for.
[02:34:41.234 --> 02:34:42.996]  The UN is part of that government.
[02:34:43.236 --> 02:34:46.459]  They're working right now very significantly for the North American Union.
[02:34:46.479 --> 02:34:49.562]  That's why there's a lot of people in Washington that don't care too much about our borders.
[02:34:50.003 --> 02:34:53.586]  They have a philosophic belief that national sovereignty is not important.
[02:34:53.907 --> 02:35:00.053]  It's also the reason I have made a very strong suggestion that we need not be in the United Nations for our national security.
[02:35:00.613 --> 02:35:02.854]  What do you think about our borders and immigration policy?
[02:35:03.055 --> 02:35:05.816]  Our borders have been totally neglected.
[02:35:06.096 --> 02:35:11.979]  We worry more about the borders between North and South Korea and between Iraq and Syria than we do about our own.
[02:35:12.039 --> 02:35:18.263]  Just recently a bunch of our border guards were picked up and sent and enticed to go over to Iraq.
[02:35:18.603 --> 02:35:19.283]  It's insane!
[02:35:19.804 --> 02:35:24.726]  I mean we should have more border guards and the only way you can afford it and get the personnel is to bring our troops home.
[02:35:24.766 --> 02:35:29.289]  We don't even have the money to finance this world empire that we operate under.
[02:35:29.529 --> 02:35:37.054]  We have to borrow almost three billion dollars a day just to pay for the war and our extravagance.
[02:35:37.074 --> 02:35:39.615]  And we borrowed from none other than China and Japan.
[02:35:39.675 --> 02:35:45.298]  I mean, we don't even have enough wealth produced in this country to finance the amount of spending that we have.
[02:35:45.659 --> 02:35:48.801]  It will come to an end, and I think most Americans realize it.
[02:35:49.141 --> 02:35:52.523]  Middle class Americans and poor Americans have already suffered the consequences.
[02:35:52.603 --> 02:35:54.484]  Their standard of living has already started down.
[02:35:54.924 --> 02:35:58.366]  Those who are doing well know deep down in their heart they're doing it on borrowed money.
[02:35:58.787 --> 02:36:00.748]  And that is going to come to an end.
[02:36:01.028 --> 02:36:03.870]  It's also the reason I emphasize the importance of sound money.
[02:36:04.310 --> 02:36:12.556]  If you allow governments, any time throughout all of history, to print money, they always print too much and they destroy the money.
[02:36:12.736 --> 02:36:18.399]  Our dollar is worth four cents of what it was when the company was created.
[02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:21.281]  Alright, now that's the YouTube clip.
[02:36:21.341 --> 02:36:21.802]  It's free.
[02:36:21.822 --> 02:36:23.583]  You can watch it on prisonplanet.com.
[02:36:24.355 --> 02:36:35.964]  If you go to PrisonPlanet.com, you can also go and watch the entire speech you're about to hear right now at PrisonPlanet.com in the article that we have posted up there for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[02:36:36.744 --> 02:36:37.905]  But here is the audio.
[02:36:37.925 --> 02:36:40.147]  We'll be able to hear almost all of the speech.
[02:36:40.167 --> 02:36:40.968]  We've got to go to break.
[02:36:41.008 --> 02:36:43.229]  We'll come back out of break and play the rest of it.
[02:36:43.690 --> 02:36:45.891]  By the way, the state of Texas, Ron Paul rented this.
[02:36:45.931 --> 02:36:46.772]  The campaign got it.
[02:36:47.333 --> 02:36:50.075]  And there's no rules against videotaping or having media.
[02:36:50.315 --> 02:36:52.797]  They tried to bar the mainstream media, everybody out of this.
[02:36:53.557 --> 02:36:55.279]  And, but here's a recording of it, folks.
[02:36:55.319 --> 02:36:56.000]  Here's a speech.
[02:36:56.700 --> 02:36:57.721]  It's not going to stop us.
[02:36:58.982 --> 02:36:59.343]  Thank you.
[02:36:59.383 --> 02:37:00.083]  Thank you very much.
[02:37:00.283 --> 02:37:02.746]  This is a bit overwhelming, believe me.
[02:37:02.786 --> 02:37:04.988]  This is wonderful.
[02:37:09.712 --> 02:37:19.461]  You know, a few months ago, excuse me, a few months ago, as a matter of fact, somebody this evening told me that last summer he suggested I do this and I was very, very reluctant and I
[02:37:20.624 --> 02:37:25.068]  In no way that I was planning to do it, nor did I really want to do it.
[02:37:25.088 --> 02:37:28.992]  And a few months after that, then others came to me and they kept talking about it.
[02:37:29.873 --> 02:37:34.037]  And the truth is, is I had been very, very reluctant.
[02:37:35.458 --> 02:37:40.743]  It wasn't that I was reluctant about our message, because I think our message is powerful.
[02:37:48.860 --> 02:38:00.307]  But I really wasn't sure whether I was the right person to do it, and eventually I said, yes I will, we'll see, and we'll find out if there's anybody out there.
[02:38:00.367 --> 02:38:04.249]  I think of the people who believe in true freedom in the way I think of the remnant.
[02:38:04.609 --> 02:38:05.610]  And evidently,
[02:38:06.090 --> 02:38:15.375]  You know, they say the remnant was out there and nobody could count them and they didn't know where they were and you can't find them, but the remnant will find you and find us.
[02:38:15.735 --> 02:38:19.197]  So it looks to me like the remnant is large and growing!
[02:38:32.412 --> 02:38:34.412]  You know, isn't it strange?
[02:38:34.472 --> 02:38:42.554]  Let's for a minute assume, which it shouldn't be too great of an assumption, that I defend the Constitution more so than the rest of the Democrats.
[02:38:49.415 --> 02:38:58.257]  But isn't it interesting also that the establishment figure is the one who most defends the Constitution has to be eliminated from the debates.
[02:38:58.297 --> 02:38:59.757]  What's going on in this country?
[02:39:04.969 --> 02:39:12.256]  You know, I'm not going to ask, but I do know that there are a few people in here who are not traditional Republicans.
[02:39:12.336 --> 02:39:14.138]  Some call themselves independent.
[02:39:14.658 --> 02:39:16.140]  Some call themselves libertarians.
[02:39:16.180 --> 02:39:19.503]  Some call themselves even Democrats!
[02:39:19.663 --> 02:39:21.144]  There may be some Democrats here!
[02:39:23.767 --> 02:39:28.852]  Now, the art of politics is to bring people together.
[02:39:28.912 --> 02:39:30.113]  It's not to be divisive.
[02:39:30.751 --> 02:39:40.453]  When you're running for an office, if you're overly pure in the sense of, you know, you have to agree A, B, C, D. You have to bring coalitions together.
[02:39:40.593 --> 02:39:41.613]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:39:41.893 --> 02:39:46.634]  And there are several groups of people that make up an electorate that I think are important this time.
[02:39:47.155 --> 02:39:58.417]  I think at the top of the list are the people who are looking for leadership in this country today, are dealing with the complications from a very, very flawed foreign policy.
[02:40:05.535 --> 02:40:18.801]  If we look at what happened in the election last year, I think the message was loud and strong, that they're sick and tired of the consequences of the foreign policy that we have, and they're looking for something new and different.
[02:40:18.821 --> 02:40:28.685]  And, quite frankly, anybody on the Democratic side that really has answered the call to come around and have a different foreign policy, because it looks to me like it's more of the same thing.
[02:40:37.119 --> 02:40:39.781]  I think that issue brings a lot of people together.
[02:40:40.101 --> 02:40:53.971]  All the various political factions will come together and right now it looks like probably about 70% of the country is now looking for a different policy, especially in the Middle East and readjust that.
[02:40:54.672 --> 02:41:03.338]  On economic policy, it is something that if you ask almost 100% of the Americans whether they believe in the free enterprise system, you know what?
[02:41:03.968 --> 02:41:06.129]  Most Americans believe in the free enterprise system.
[02:41:06.989 --> 02:41:16.011]  Too often, though, too often what happens is, yes, I believe in free enterprise for myself, but I like, I mean for everybody else, but I like special privileges for myself.
[02:41:16.771 --> 02:41:24.393]  So, but to really believe in free enterprise, you have to believe in market competition for everybody, and nobody gets subsidies.
[02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:37.103]  A lot of times they think subsidies and welfare goes to poor people.
[02:41:37.343 --> 02:41:41.025]  Yeah, there's some welfare that goes to poor people, but sometimes I think they're crumbs.
[02:41:41.685 --> 02:41:47.489]  The real big welfare in the system that we have goes to the military-industrial complex and the big banks.
[02:41:54.927 --> 02:42:03.593]  But the market economy should bring people together, especially when it's realized that the system that we have today is ripping off the middle class and the poor.
[02:42:04.273 --> 02:42:10.517]  They're the ones who suffer from the inflation and the regulations and all the government interference.
[02:42:10.917 --> 02:42:13.879]  So that to me is an issue that brings people together.
[02:42:14.540 --> 02:42:19.663]  One person told me not too long ago, I think it was said on television, they said, well you ought to run as a Democrat.
[02:42:20.450 --> 02:42:23.261]  And I said, well, why should I run as a Democrat?
[02:42:23.361 --> 02:42:25.389]  I'm the most conservative member of the Congress!
[02:42:32.153 --> 02:42:34.375]  So they get twisted up.
[02:42:34.415 --> 02:42:40.520]  They don't know how to label those of us who believe in liberty because liberty is really pervasive.
[02:42:40.741 --> 02:42:42.502]  It's beneficial to everybody.
[02:42:42.582 --> 02:42:44.524]  It's not beneficial to special groups.
[02:42:44.544 --> 02:42:48.448]  So if you can vote for, you know, less money.
[02:42:48.468 --> 02:42:54.313]  Now there's some very well-known liberal individuals in this country who are coming out and supporting our campaign.
[02:42:54.793 --> 02:42:55.833]  Which is very interesting.
[02:42:55.893 --> 02:42:59.335]  You would say, well, liberals don't like, uh, they like big spending and all.
[02:42:59.555 --> 02:43:03.557]  But why would they be coming out and endorsing our campaign now?
[02:43:03.997 --> 02:43:10.079]  Quite frankly, because of foreign policy and attacking special interests for the rich and the benefit.
[02:43:10.099 --> 02:43:13.180]  So, this is a tremendously powerful message.
[02:43:13.841 --> 02:43:19.603]  And there's another element that should bring people together, and that is the concept of personal individual liberty.
[02:43:31.290 --> 02:43:34.011]  Personal liberty is not a special interest.
[02:43:34.231 --> 02:43:35.932]  It's the only interest that really counts.
[02:43:36.252 --> 02:43:39.273]  See, I don't like to think of rights being group rights.
[02:43:39.873 --> 02:43:46.355]  Not to offend anybody, but I don't see things like women's rights and minority rights and all this.
[02:43:46.475 --> 02:43:47.835]  I just don't think that's possible.
[02:43:48.195 --> 02:43:49.816]  Rights are given to individuals.
[02:43:49.936 --> 02:43:52.117]  I personally have a belief they come from our Creator.
[02:43:52.137 --> 02:43:59.799]  Which means, then,
[02:44:01.036 --> 02:44:04.338]  Your life is your own, and you have your own responsibility.
[02:44:04.498 --> 02:44:07.500]  I mean, you have a responsibility of what's going to happen for eternity.
[02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:10.822]  So you ought to have a responsibility of what you're going to do here on Earth as well.
[02:44:11.302 --> 02:44:23.890]  But personal liberty means tolerance as well, because what your neighbor might do might be different than what you do.
[02:44:24.410 --> 02:44:26.992]  And you might not like what they do, but if your neighbor
[02:44:27.566 --> 02:44:36.808]  Or your friends, they do things that you don't approve of, but they don't affect you, if they don't hurt you, if they don't use force on you, they should be permitted to do this!
[02:44:37.508 --> 02:44:50.591]  Your job... Your job is to take responsibility, and our job is to take responsibility for ourselves, to improve our well-being, and improve and work for excellence, and that's what freedom is all about.
[02:44:51.380 --> 02:44:54.542]  But which group of people should this bring together?
[02:44:54.702 --> 02:44:57.883]  You know, if I say, well, I don't want to regulate your personal life.
[02:44:58.263 --> 02:45:00.425]  And you say, what's that mean?
[02:45:00.485 --> 02:45:03.886]  I don't want to tell you why you can eat, smoke, and drink, and whatever you want to do?
[02:45:03.926 --> 02:45:07.928]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:45:08.068 --> 02:45:13.011]  Now the question is, is this going to offend conservative Christian rights?
[02:45:13.672 --> 02:45:14.533]  And it should not!
[02:45:14.853 --> 02:45:28.201]  And it's something that I've worked on for many, many years in the Congressional District, is to believe in individual liberty, not put on sanctions, and not pretend I can regulate your personal moral life, and have that appeal to the Christian right.
[02:45:28.762 --> 02:45:37.287]  I happen to believe all life is sacred, so therefore I don't believe that small little fetuses can be dropped away without, you know, concern about it.
[02:45:37.768 --> 02:45:39.189]  But this, this idea...
[02:45:43.539 --> 02:45:53.884]  This idea of personal liberty, which might allow individuals to do things that others might not approve of, it is also exactly the liberty that we need to practice our religion.
[02:45:54.445 --> 02:45:58.807]  And to keep the government off our backs on that.
[02:45:58.847 --> 02:46:07.091]  You know, back to the concern about, you know, the idea of running for the president and presidency.
[02:46:07.111 --> 02:46:08.172]  This means that
[02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:15.664]  Today, the conventional wisdom is, we have to have a president to run things.
[02:46:15.764 --> 02:46:17.465]  How are you going to run things?
[02:46:17.665 --> 02:46:25.851]  You know, what I'd like to be is a president that doesn't even have a goal of running your life, running the economy, or running the world.
[02:46:37.151 --> 02:46:47.234]  My conviction and my effort to restrain anybody who uses force illegally, that people not be allowed to try to run other people's lives.
[02:46:47.354 --> 02:46:52.815]  And that will take a lot of doing because a lot of people have become dependent on the government.
[02:46:52.835 --> 02:47:05.719]  Another issue that I deal with, and now this is in the real world politics, because we might in a group like this agree, you know, we don't need the welfare, and we don't need this, leave us alone, and it would all be better, and quite frankly I think it would be.
[02:47:06.292 --> 02:47:14.079]  We live in the real world where we have taught generations after generations to be totally dependent on the government.
[02:47:14.539 --> 02:47:21.926]  So realistically, you know, you can't just shut off every government health program and whatever for the elderly.
[02:47:22.506 --> 02:47:25.349]  But there's a very practical answer for this.
[02:47:26.312 --> 02:47:47.560]  Overseas now, to run the American Empire, if you add up the DOD budget, if you add up the Secretary of the State Department budget, if you add up what would cost to run the military, take care of the veterans, and on and on, do you know that it's nearing one trillion dollars a year to operate overseas while ignoring our borders?
[02:47:50.129 --> 02:47:51.490]  So why not we do this?
[02:47:51.731 --> 02:48:12.251]  If it's $1 trillion, let's say that we could have a true national defense for say $700 billion, save $700, spend $300 on defense, save $700, put a lot of that to the deficit, bring it home, deal with our borders, and make sure the people that are very dependent take care of them until we can wean them off.
[02:48:24.964 --> 02:48:33.459]  I believe that almost every single problem that we're facing today has come about because we haven't been a stickler for the rule of law.
[02:48:33.499 --> 02:48:36.484]  We haven't followed the Constitution, and that's what we ought to be doing.
[02:48:48.937 --> 02:48:54.406]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.786 --> 02:49:02.398]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.112 --> 02:49:10.155]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.555 --> 02:49:21.980]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.300 --> 02:49:25.762]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.262 --> 02:49:28.223]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.523 --> 02:49:32.365]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:51.324 --> 02:50:53.544]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.

[02:51:00.406 --> 02:51:05.327]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:05.527 --> 02:51:14.470]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[02:51:46.869 --> 02:51:54.778]  The fact that the problems have been created by the lack of respect for the Constitution, the answers can be found there.
[02:51:54.838 --> 02:52:01.146]  They can be found there in foreign policy, on economic policy, property rights, personal liberties, all these things.
[02:52:01.366 --> 02:52:02.387]  Monetary policy.
[02:52:02.648 --> 02:52:07.093]  Can you imagine how great a nation we'd have if we didn't have the Federal Reserve System printing all
[02:52:18.023 --> 02:52:29.523]  And it goes without saying, it goes without saying that when we have the proper sized government and governments function in the proper manner, we certainly wouldn't need the IRS or the 16th Amendment.
[02:52:41.144 --> 02:52:43.569]  Government has a role to play, but it should be minimal.
[02:52:43.609 --> 02:52:50.665]  The sole purpose of political activity, as far as I'm concerned, should be protection of individual liberty.
[02:52:56.357 --> 02:53:02.778]  I think what's happened in this country is we've lost respect for the rule of law, but we've lost respect and confidence in how liberty works.
[02:53:03.219 --> 02:53:17.282]  We're always frightened that if the government doesn't provide the safety net, there's going to be more poverty, no housing, and all the things that happened over the last several decades.
[02:53:17.822 --> 02:53:21.082]  But this is not necessary.
[02:53:21.202 --> 02:53:22.243]  It is so unnecessary.
[02:53:22.643 --> 02:53:23.563]  Freedom works!
[02:53:24.400 --> 02:53:28.326]  We have lost that confidence where we know and understand that it will work.
[02:53:28.847 --> 02:53:36.338]  But there is one admonition that John Adams gave, and he said, for freedom really to work, you have to have a moral society.
[02:53:39.332 --> 02:53:57.744]  So, we can come down very hard on our government, and I do, all three branches of the government, but quite frankly, even our candidacy here, if we're successful, it still requires an endorsement from the people.
[02:53:58.184 --> 02:54:00.026]  And that's where I have been reluctant.
[02:54:00.266 --> 02:54:02.487]  I did not know where the numbers would be.
[02:54:02.908 --> 02:54:04.989]  I did not know whether the money would be there.
[02:54:05.089 --> 02:54:06.270]  I did not understand
[02:54:06.670 --> 02:54:09.973]  The internet, but I have been educated in the last few weeks.
[02:54:19.700 --> 02:54:27.766]  And we do know that truth wins out in the end, but I didn't know that there were so many so ready to receive the truth about what's going on.
[02:54:38.425 --> 02:54:42.013]  But it truly gives me hope and that's what we need.
[02:54:42.554 --> 02:54:46.703]  We have lived and been blessed to live in a country that has been really great.
[02:54:47.304 --> 02:54:52.547]  We are fortunate that we have the founders that we did that understood what personal liberty was all about.
[02:54:52.567 --> 02:54:57.270]  They even understood what habeas corpus meant.
[02:54:57.711 --> 02:55:08.457]  And unfortunately, we moved into this era where they're endorsing torture and getting rid of habeas corpus, warrantless searches, national ID cards.
[02:55:10.425 --> 02:55:12.449]  I think the American people are catching on.
[02:55:12.489 --> 02:55:21.222]  You know, the National ID Card was voted on overwhelmingly, but now do you know, I'll bet you do, that a lot of states are now condemning it and won't participate.
[02:55:21.242 --> 02:55:21.984]  They're waking up!
[02:55:33.672 --> 02:55:35.453]  You know, I don't know how this will end.
[02:55:35.553 --> 02:55:36.293]  That is the truth.
[02:55:36.393 --> 02:55:40.315]  I could come up here and say, I absolutely know how it's going to turn out.
[02:55:40.475 --> 02:55:44.416]  I don't know, and you don't know, but I do know that the message is good.
[02:55:44.897 --> 02:55:46.197]  The message of liberty is good.
[02:55:46.217 --> 02:55:47.478]  We've lived in a great country.
[02:55:47.598 --> 02:55:53.280]  We need to fall back on the traditions of our Constitution and the traditions of America.
[02:55:53.860 --> 02:55:55.161]  And we will do well.
[02:55:55.341 --> 02:56:01.283]  But I am quite confident now that the numbers are larger than I ever believed.
[02:56:01.403 --> 02:56:02.684]  I think we're moving in the right direction.
[02:56:04.693 --> 02:56:06.194]  There's only about two minutes left of this.
[02:56:06.214 --> 02:56:07.114]  We'll air it tomorrow.
[02:56:07.134 --> 02:56:09.375]  We'll back it up a few minutes and air it tomorrow when we start the show.
[02:56:09.776 --> 02:56:14.778]  Or you can watch it right now at PrisonPlanet.com and a lot more Ron Paul coverage there.
[02:56:15.418 --> 02:56:16.299]  Hope for America.
[02:56:16.359 --> 02:56:16.979]  Be part of it.
[02:56:17.059 --> 02:56:19.420]  Join the fight against the New World Order.
[02:56:20.081 --> 02:56:21.561]  God bless you all.
