[00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:10.205]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:11.665]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.406 --> 00:00:13.426]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.987 --> 00:00:17.609]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.292]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.925 --> 00:00:33.787]  Yeah.
[00:00:40.393 --> 00:00:50.561]  Because at half past nine this morning, we were actually running an exercise for a company of a thousand people in London, based on simultaneous bombs going off precisely at the railway stations that happened this morning.
[00:00:50.981 --> 00:00:53.283]  So I still have the hairs on the back of my neck standing upright.
[00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:59.888]  To get this quite straight, you were running an exercise to see how you would cope with this, and it happened while you were running the exercise?
[00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:00.649]  Precisely.
[00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.770]  And it was about half past nine this morning.
[00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.333]  We planned this for the company, and for obvious reasons, I don't want to reveal their name, but if they're listening, they'll know it.
[00:01:07.575 --> 00:01:13.222]  The only thing I have, um, we're a little bit unprepared.
[00:01:13.382 --> 00:01:16.946]  We're bribed by the Arts Council.
[00:01:17.287 --> 00:01:18.948]  It's a very low budget we've got.
[00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:20.390]  We don't get paid for this at all.
[00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:23.714]  We get sent out on these missions to interview celebrities.
[00:01:23.794 --> 00:01:26.817]  It turns out, one thing I won't tolerate, you're filming me now, aren't you?
[00:01:27.678 --> 00:01:37.824]  Mr. Power, we'd like to know who you're running mock terror drills for on 7-7.
[00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.225]  Which company were you working for?
[00:01:39.285 --> 00:01:43.327]  You say there's a precise station, precise times at the precise three stations.
[00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:44.287]  Have you any comment on that?
[00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:47.689]  Why have you not been investigated or the company investigated?
[00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:50.010]  Why have you not investigated, Mr. Power?
[00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.992]  52 people died in those bombings, Mr. Power.
[00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.253]  52 people died in those power...
[00:01:57.794 --> 00:01:59.694]  52 people died, Mr. Power.
[00:01:59.894 --> 00:02:02.115]  How do you know which three stations?
[00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.835]  Who helped you choose those three stations?
[00:02:04.535 --> 00:02:05.916]  How many people knew, Mr. Power?
[00:02:05.956 --> 00:02:07.196]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:07.216 --> 00:02:09.637]  Welcome and thank you for joining us.
[00:02:10.877 --> 00:02:12.377]  It is the live edition
[00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:31.604]  Friday edition, the 14th of December 2007 headline, Peter Power flees from confrontation on 7-7 Terror Drill.
[00:02:31.644 --> 00:02:36.505]  Former Scotland Yard official refuses to answer questions about who the exercise was conducted for.
[00:02:36.525 --> 00:02:38.145]  Our intel, of course, is London Underground.
[00:02:38.526 --> 00:02:43.227]  Are the exact same trains being bombed at the exact same time, at the exact same locations?
[00:02:43.727 --> 00:02:55.678]  That is more than 1 in 24, correct a gillion, or billions of times all the grains of sand in all the world that that would happen, covered in my film, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:09.411]  And now We Are Change UK went to one of his events and just asked him about it, and Mr. Power literally ran into a closet, into a room, small room, and locked himself in it with no one until they were forced out of the building.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.421]  He would not answer that question.
[00:03:12.441 --> 00:03:14.202]  You're saying, why does this matter if you're a new listener?
[00:03:14.222 --> 00:03:15.522]  9-11.
[00:03:15.542 --> 00:03:16.243]  7-7.
[00:03:16.843 --> 00:03:17.623]  Oklahoma City.
[00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:19.424]  World Trade Center first attack.
[00:03:21.145 --> 00:03:24.406]  The Russian bombings that happened in 99 that Putin carried out.
[00:03:24.446 --> 00:03:26.687]  They always run drills to cover it.
[00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:38.893]  Because most of the government is not involved in the terror op, and that's so if other agencies pick up chatter, pick up intelligence, if police or others see something suspicious, and stop government agents, they just say,
[00:03:40.894 --> 00:03:43.275]  I was carrying out a drill, that's all.
[00:03:43.295 --> 00:03:46.855]  This satchel of explosives is part of a drill.
[00:03:46.895 --> 00:04:07.920]  When Moscow police in 1999 caught the Federal Security Bureau slash KGB planting bombs in a fourth building, they'd already blown up three apartment complexes, killing hundreds each time, the Moscow police caught them, arrested them, and Putin had them released, had the police station raided and the hexogen bombs taken back, plastic explosives, Russian military grade, and they said in the news it was just a drill.
[00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.052]  Yes, it's always just a drill, isn't it?
[00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:16.737]  So that's some of the big news today up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:04:16.777 --> 00:04:20.681]  Peter Power flees from confrontation on 7-7 terror drill.
[00:04:21.021 --> 00:04:31.211]  The managing director of the company that eerily and some charged suspiciously were running drills identical to the events that unfolded on 7-7 in London had to flee from members of We Are Change UK this week
[00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:38.374]  When he was asked to explain who had hired his consultancy firm to run exercises that coincided with the bombing.
[00:04:38.714 --> 00:04:45.017]  Peter Power, head of Visor Consultants, was a former Scotland Yard official working at the time with Anti-Terror Branch.
[00:04:45.797 --> 00:04:47.658]  This and a lot more on the other side.
[00:04:47.978 --> 00:04:50.879]  We've got Naomi Wolfe joining us for part two of our interview.
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.720]  Daniel Estelin from Spain.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.561]  We Are Change UK today.
[00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:56.542]  Trevor Lyman and a lot more.
[00:04:56.762 --> 00:04:57.782]  Totally jam-packed.
[00:04:58.343 --> 00:04:59.123]  Keep it locked in.
[00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:03.449]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.591]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:10.475]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:13.357]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:14.018 --> 00:05:16.279]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.202]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:27.336]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:35.283]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.803 --> 00:05:39.246]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.647 --> 00:05:42.169]  Bill of Rights is making great progress for New World Order.
[00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:43.370]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.131]  They're not after money.
[00:05:44.151 --> 00:05:45.232]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.452 --> 00:05:46.193]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:47.434]  That's what they're after.

[00:06:57.184 --> 00:06:59.766]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:07:01.165 --> 00:07:03.006]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:07:03.166 --> 00:07:09.850]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:18.294]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:07:18.514 --> 00:07:24.237]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:07:24.397 --> 00:07:26.180]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.423]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:07:28.443 --> 00:07:32.809]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:35.132]  I recommend Fartin Body Extract to everyone.
[00:07:35.212 --> 00:07:41.641]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardio
[00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:44.602]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.766 --> 00:08:20.548]  We had 80 entries for the Radio and TV at Vaughn Hall Contest.
[00:08:20.628 --> 00:08:29.572]  I will be announcing 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place by the end of the broadcast transmission today.
[00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:36.614]  I literally had friends over last night, a rare occurrence for dinner, and then afterwards I tried to continue judging.
[00:08:37.034 --> 00:08:49.283]  Then this morning I basically narrowed it down to about six different video 60-second Ron Paul TV ads from our TruthNews.us Ron Paul 2008 television radio ads.
[00:08:50.484 --> 00:08:55.588]  And so now during the breaks I'll be watching these six video ads, narrowing it down to first, second, and third place.
[00:08:56.508 --> 00:09:00.610]  Maybe an honorable mention, and then there's one place, $500 prize for the best radio ad.
[00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.210]  Total prizes of $3,100.
[00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:05.291]  But it's all a win-win for everybody.
[00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:08.853]  The ads are all excellent, by the way, and some of them very poignant and touching.
[00:09:09.653 --> 00:09:24.659]  And there's quite a few more that I may not have time to play on air today, but that I will definitely play, maybe even Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., as we have live coverage of the Ron Paul money bomb that mainstream news and the bookies are saying could now raise $10 million.
[00:09:27.026 --> 00:09:51.625]  The odds are that he'll raise over $6 million, but the odds are pretty much dead heat that he could raise $10 million coming up this Sunday on the Boston Tea Party anniversary of what happened back in 1773 that kicked off the chain of events that led to 1776 and the glorious victory and the birth of our nation.
[00:09:52.886 --> 00:09:54.647]  So that is coming up.
[00:09:55.567 --> 00:09:57.228]  I literally continue to judge these.
[00:09:59.029 --> 00:10:09.234]  I can tell you right now that first place, I can announce right now that first place, but we've got to announce who second and third place from video awards are, is once in a lifetime.
[00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:25.047]  I thought this was the winner back a week ago, but I had to find out that it was specifically made because some of these ads that were submitted already had been made and they just submitted to our contest, which is fine, but I wanted to make sure that this had been made specifically for our contest.
[00:10:25.107 --> 00:10:27.368]  It was very professional.
[00:10:28.184 --> 00:10:33.528]  And, of course, it is a TV commercial maker, I guess, out in Las Vegas that did this.
[00:10:34.048 --> 00:10:38.050]  And so I can tell you right now, the $2,000 goes to Once in a Lifetime.
[00:10:38.091 --> 00:10:39.491]  That's the name of the TV ad.
[00:10:39.812 --> 00:10:41.653]  And I'm still having to choose second and third place.
[00:10:41.673 --> 00:10:43.254]  I'm looking at five other choices here.
[00:10:44.034 --> 00:10:45.295]  And then, of course, one radio ad.
[00:10:45.315 --> 00:10:46.256]  But that has been said.
[00:10:46.276 --> 00:10:49.618]  I have now completed my babble on that subject.
[00:10:52.415 --> 00:10:55.816]  Peter Power flees from confrontation on 7-7 Terror Drill.
[00:10:56.316 --> 00:10:57.316]  This is a big deal.
[00:10:57.617 --> 00:10:58.397]  We are Change UK.
[00:10:58.417 --> 00:10:59.717]  Again, we just played the audio of that.
[00:11:00.197 --> 00:11:03.858]  Went up and started asking him, hey, 50 plus people died in these bombings.
[00:11:04.339 --> 00:11:07.439]  You said you were running drills at the exact same locations, exact same time.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.180]  That's impossible.
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.521]  I mean, that's just off the charts.
[00:11:11.541 --> 00:11:15.202]  That's like being struck a hundred times by lightning in the same location.
[00:11:15.222 --> 00:11:19.203]  I mean, the math is even more insane than that.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.081]  Uh, it's what, one and twenty-something truck of a gillion.
[00:11:25.061 --> 00:11:28.302]  It's got 42 zeros on it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:29.823 --> 00:11:31.123]  So, uh, we will be getting into that.
[00:11:31.303 --> 00:11:36.544]  Also, this broke yesterday after months of being in the Mexican and Latin American news.
[00:11:36.624 --> 00:11:37.925]  It finally percolated into U.S.
[00:11:37.945 --> 00:11:38.145]  news.
[00:11:40.129 --> 00:11:40.890]  We're good to go.
[00:12:05.262 --> 00:12:10.923]  Whose trajectory was to fly into the United States.
[00:12:12.184 --> 00:12:13.184]  Into Texas.
[00:12:14.084 --> 00:12:18.405]  And of course it crashed going over the Yucatan Peninsula.
[00:12:20.185 --> 00:12:21.746]  Killing all aboard.
[00:12:22.666 --> 00:12:28.287]  And loaded with 3.3 tons of pure Peruvian flake.
[00:12:30.988 --> 00:12:32.348]  That of course would hit the streets.
[00:12:33.468 --> 00:12:37.350]  And SWAT teams will bust in lots of doors to stop the evil drugs.
[00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:45.353]  And then the big banks that wanted the money literally own every one of the major private prisons so they get double duty.
[00:12:46.154 --> 00:12:50.556]  The police get to seize the money and keep it and expand their militarized system.
[00:12:52.417 --> 00:12:55.238]  The prisons owned by the drug dealers get to expand.
[00:12:56.596 --> 00:13:04.963]  The police state gets to ever rise further and there have been hundreds of cases of C-130s and jets crashing all over the U.S.
[00:13:05.003 --> 00:13:10.648]  and all over Latin America with CIA pilots, government agents, DEA agents, CIA officers.
[00:13:11.048 --> 00:13:13.410]  I've interviewed Terry Reid, CIA officer.
[00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:24.399]  He thought he was just training pilots for operations in Latin America and he saw them unloading the cocaine month after month, saw Bill Clinton show up at the airbase.
[00:13:25.146 --> 00:13:26.827]  He just couldn't put up with it and spoke out.
[00:13:27.168 --> 00:13:28.729]  Wrote Clinton, Bush, and the CIA.
[00:13:29.149 --> 00:13:36.234]  Celica Stillo, head of the DEA in Latin America, watched the CIA at El Pongo and other air bases loading tons of cocaine daily.
[00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:39.276]  I mean, it's just a public operation.
[00:13:39.597 --> 00:13:40.978]  It's been in the cover of Esquire.
[00:13:41.038 --> 00:13:41.358]  It's been
[00:13:42.817 --> 00:13:51.661]  Local police many times have busted planes at airfields from Texas to Florida to Illinois to California and the guys will just pull out CIA badges.
[00:13:51.701 --> 00:13:53.522]  The FBI shows up and says back off.
[00:13:53.802 --> 00:13:59.204]  The DEA has busted airplane after airplane with the government flying in cocaine, heroin and other goodies.
[00:13:59.564 --> 00:14:06.627]  Huge plane loads of ecstasy being flown in from Israel and it's always government agents flying the aircraft.
[00:14:07.008 --> 00:14:08.028]  They just say shut up!
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:19.288]  I mean, literally, the cops will pull guns on them, and the CIA will pull guns and say, back off, hold up their badges, feds show up and chew out the police, and the police put their tail between their legs and walk off.
[00:14:20.789 --> 00:14:21.610]  That's how it works.
[00:14:22.771 --> 00:14:30.998]  But your zit-faced teenage son gets caught with some cocaine, and he's going to be going away for five years on average.
[00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:35.201]  It's just an absolute, complete, and total travesty.
[00:14:36.656 --> 00:14:49.883]  As the corporate media discusses ad nauseum the waterboarding of one of the CIA's own, the mentally ill Patsy, another story has surfaced, but not one you will likely see anytime soon on the front page of the New York Times.
[00:14:50.323 --> 00:15:00.329]  On September 24, 2007, one report says Florida, one says Texas-based, Florida-based Gulfstream II jet aircraft numbered nine
[00:15:01.724 --> 00:15:05.625]  N987SA crashed in the Yucatan, Southern Mexico.
[00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:18.067]  As it turns out, not only was the plane used by the CIA rendition flights from Europe and the United States to the Guantanamo torture chamber, but it was loaded with tons of cocaine when it went down.
[00:15:18.087 --> 00:15:28.369]  El Nuno Herald reported that the CIA plane was loaded with up to 3.3 tons of coke in Medellin, Colombia,
[00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:40.864]  And was used to ferry hundreds of detainees, including alleged members of the Taliban, to Cuba for waterboarding and other specialties.
[00:15:41.565 --> 00:15:47.851]  A sharp-eyed Daily Kos blogger found the news article on El Nuevo Herald's website.
[00:15:48.372 --> 00:15:50.915]  He was smart enough to screen capture the page because
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:57.763]  As should be expected, the original news story had since found its way into the memory hole and was removed.
[00:15:58.083 --> 00:16:03.406]  It was, however, picked up by the Mexican blog La Paca Madrid News.
[00:16:04.469 --> 00:16:17.755]  I was recently listening to one of my favorite radio programs that is broadcast on 99.5 FM in New York City, hosted by the tough-as-nails Michael Levine, one of the most highly decorated DEA agents in the agency's history.
[00:16:18.195 --> 00:16:24.038]  The subject matter was about the plane being linked to the CIA torture flights, writes Blogger.
[00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:26.919]  You can see a YouTube clip of that radio show.
[00:16:28.163 --> 00:16:36.754]  The guy Mr. Levine had on his program was Bill Conroy, a former Gary Webb-inspired investigative journalist who writes for Narco News Publisher.
[00:16:38.294 --> 00:16:40.896]  As well as Alexander Cockburn's counterpunch.
[00:16:40.936 --> 00:16:51.902]  And then it just goes on to say the particular Gulfstream 2, telenumber N987SA, was used between 2003 and 2005 by the CIA for at least three trips between the U.S.
[00:16:52.302 --> 00:16:56.064]  East Coast and Guantanamo Bay, home to the infamous terrorist prison camp.
[00:16:56.305 --> 00:17:01.888]  According to a number of press reports, the suggestion is that the CIA plane was flying a huge quantity of drugs towards the U.S.
[00:17:02.308 --> 00:17:03.048]  We're good to go.
[00:17:22.012 --> 00:17:22.373]  I don't know.
[00:17:38.185 --> 00:17:41.267]  Of course, CIA complicity in the cocaine business is nothing new.
[00:17:41.287 --> 00:17:44.330]  They don't call it the Cocaine Importing Agency for nothing.
[00:18:07.739 --> 00:18:09.701]  It just goes on and on and on.
[00:18:10.902 --> 00:18:11.502]  Young people.
[00:18:14.224 --> 00:18:17.887]  They push cocaine and heroin in movies and on MTV like it's cool.
[00:18:18.928 --> 00:18:20.529]  It's supposedly counterculture.
[00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:24.352]  It is the dumbest, stupidest thing you could ever do.
[00:18:24.452 --> 00:18:25.393]  Don't get on Ritalin.
[00:18:25.413 --> 00:18:26.374]  Don't get on Prozac.
[00:18:26.394 --> 00:18:27.454]  Don't get on cocaine.
[00:18:27.855 --> 00:18:31.317]  Don't take, uh, prohibitol.
[00:18:32.038 --> 00:18:35.861]  Don't use any of their drugs.
[00:18:36.704 --> 00:18:40.387]  If you've got to use drugs, if you won't stop yourself, drink.
[00:18:40.947 --> 00:18:43.829]  At least they can't put you in prison for 10 years for it.
[00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:45.811]  Don't drink either.
[00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:52.876]  The point is, is do not use their drugs.
[00:18:52.936 --> 00:18:56.678]  They ship it in, it's a trap, they set you up, beat them.
[00:18:57.399 --> 00:18:59.080]  Be clean cut, dress nice.
[00:18:59.841 --> 00:19:05.725]  Every day you don't go to prison, every day you don't get on probation is a victory against the New World Order.
[00:19:07.412 --> 00:19:11.813]  They tell you, look I don't care if you got long dreadlocks and 500 tattoos, it doesn't matter to me.
[00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:13.053]  Whatever your style is.
[00:19:13.093 --> 00:19:16.114]  The point is, though, the police have been trained to alert on that.
[00:19:16.434 --> 00:19:24.396]  They've been trained that that means you're part of a subculture and to feed on you, you're basically putting on their enemy's uniform.
[00:19:25.056 --> 00:19:25.956]  Stop playing the game.
[00:19:25.976 --> 00:19:32.138]  Wear button-up shirts, slacks, Levi's, nice shoes, work hard, make lots of money.
[00:19:32.964 --> 00:19:36.566]  Go camping, have friends, get in shape, beat them.
[00:19:37.007 --> 00:19:38.127]  Get off the drugs.
[00:19:38.467 --> 00:19:39.208]  You can do it.
[00:19:39.588 --> 00:19:41.029]  You can defeat the New World Order.
[00:19:41.429 --> 00:19:44.751]  Stop using their filthy, dirty products.
[00:19:45.232 --> 00:19:46.232]  Stop letting them.
[00:19:47.033 --> 00:19:48.434]  Loads you on the slave ships.
[00:19:50.115 --> 00:19:51.716]  Get off drugs now.
[00:19:52.976 --> 00:19:53.377]  Do it.
[00:19:54.898 --> 00:19:56.399]  We'll be right back with a bunch of other news.
[00:19:56.419 --> 00:19:56.839]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.437 --> 00:20:03.238]  Ted Anders for Midas, December 14, 2007.
[00:20:04.259 --> 00:20:11.205]  Gold 790, 70 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $814.67, $401.55 per half, $278 per quarter.
[00:20:11.225 --> 00:20:14.527]  That's $814.67, $401.55, and $278.
[00:20:15.748 --> 00:20:19.031]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:23.494]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[00:20:23.815 --> 00:20:27.778]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[00:20:28.158 --> 00:20:29.999]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:32.200]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[00:20:32.461 --> 00:20:38.464]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[00:20:38.884 --> 00:20:45.668]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[00:20:45.988 --> 00:20:46.869]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[00:20:46.889 --> 00:20:47.189]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.232 --> 00:20:57.134]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[00:20:58.254 --> 00:20:58.975]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:59.295 --> 00:21:01.056]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[00:21:02.696 --> 00:21:04.757]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:21:05.378 --> 00:21:14.322]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:21:14.762 --> 00:21:21.945]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:21:22.674 --> 00:21:28.159]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:21:28.659 --> 00:21:39.489]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:21:40.249 --> 00:21:42.311]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:21:42.812 --> 00:21:44.333]  For more information, call 702-953-ZX.
[00:21:58.124 --> 00:22:02.187]  It's a fact.
[00:22:02.407 --> 00:22:09.871]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:22:09.991 --> 00:22:18.836]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:22:19.116 --> 00:22:29.710]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:35.958]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:22:36.218 --> 00:22:41.239]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:22:41.419 --> 00:22:45.900]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.861]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:22:47.881 --> 00:22:48.081]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:22:48.101 --> 00:22:48.481]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:22:48.501 --> 00:22:49.801]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:22:49.821 --> 00:22:50.521]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[00:23:01.661 --> 00:23:04.605]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:23:04.765 --> 00:23:09.931]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:23:10.271 --> 00:23:15.597]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:23:15.998 --> 00:23:17.099]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:23:17.459 --> 00:23:26.387]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:23:26.787 --> 00:23:28.408]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:23:28.628 --> 00:23:37.476]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[00:23:55.348 --> 00:23:56.588]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[00:23:56.608 --> 00:23:56.929]  Day after day
[00:24:11.886 --> 00:24:16.350]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[00:24:17.992 --> 00:24:21.175]  But nobody wants to know him.
[00:24:21.575 --> 00:24:25.319]  They can see that he's just a fool.
[00:24:25.439 --> 00:24:30.824]  And he never gives an answer, but the fool learns a hint.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:56.045]  The Elite Four saw resistance to their global control grid, their high-tech surveillance net, their brainwashing of the police, the system they were setting up.
[00:24:56.085 --> 00:24:58.986]  So that's why they are accelerating their program now.
[00:24:59.006 --> 00:25:00.206]  That's why they put it in place.
[00:25:01.019 --> 00:25:05.140]  Before the rebellion against their tyranny, before the screws got cranked down.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.561]  But I'm getting photos, video, news articles from France, England, the U.S.
[00:25:09.601 --> 00:25:13.002]  Speed cameras are being baseball batted and shot.
[00:25:13.982 --> 00:25:17.723]  People are destroying cameras coast to coast in the U.S.
[00:25:18.203 --> 00:25:21.204]  It doesn't normally make the press, but it's starting to.
[00:25:21.764 --> 00:25:24.845]  Every indicator of resistance is intensifying.
[00:25:25.765 --> 00:25:30.326]  Every indicator of people waking up and taking action is intensifying.
[00:25:30.951 --> 00:25:33.594]  Naomi Wolf is going to be joining us for 45 minutes.
[00:25:33.635 --> 00:25:40.824]  We had her on a few weeks ago, and she, of course, broke the news that she discovered that Bush's grandfather was the top Nazi in the U.S.
[00:25:41.264 --> 00:25:48.213]  We, of course, broke that years ago, but the point is that she's pretty mainstream, establishment-type, and she is now waking up.
[00:25:48.849 --> 00:25:52.512]  So she'll be joining us to talk about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:25:52.652 --> 00:26:00.818]  She's joining us to talk about the Hitlerian connection, the police state, the 10 steps towards fascism that are being set up in the country.
[00:26:01.518 --> 00:26:05.561]  Some of the other reports, I got a call from a listener yesterday saying, have you seen the glowing cat report?
[00:26:06.121 --> 00:26:11.825]  I brought up glowing monkey report, how they're selling glowing monkeys that are part jellyfish.
[00:26:11.865 --> 00:26:16.689]  And then I do have the report here about glowing cats.
[00:26:17.901 --> 00:26:21.022]  I mean, that's how far the genetic engineering's gone, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:21.362 --> 00:26:26.964]  And the scientists that have designed all this admit that they can change the genetics to make a cat glow in the dark.
[00:26:27.945 --> 00:26:29.025]  With jellyfish genes.
[00:26:29.545 --> 00:26:30.606]  Glowing jellyfish genes.
[00:26:31.686 --> 00:26:37.488]  But, that one change changes thousands of things randomly and can give rise to super viruses,
[00:26:38.417 --> 00:26:41.758]  Super bacteria mutations, and this has already happened.
[00:26:42.298 --> 00:26:47.000]  And it's already causing all sorts of problems in thousands of different areas of the global biosphere.
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.761]  But the environmentalists aren't worried about that.
[00:26:50.121 --> 00:26:52.402]  They want a global tax.
[00:26:53.342 --> 00:26:55.443]  And I have news reports today.
[00:26:56.926 --> 00:27:00.267]  Mainstream reports where they are calling it a global tax.
[00:27:00.827 --> 00:27:02.908]  We've always told you they would push a carbon tax.
[00:27:03.248 --> 00:27:07.549]  We always told you it would be pushed for saving the Earth.
[00:27:07.589 --> 00:27:09.270]  It is literally a tax on breathing.
[00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:15.992]  It is literally a tax on all human activity.
[00:27:16.012 --> 00:27:18.112]  It does nothing for the environment.
[00:27:18.473 --> 00:27:22.374]  And Paul Watson's written a powerful article up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:27:22.414 --> 00:27:26.455]  Over 100 prominent scientists challenge UN move for global carbon tax.
[00:27:27.651 --> 00:27:28.853]  Now, we talked about this three years ago.
[00:27:28.893 --> 00:27:30.174]  People said this just didn't exist.
[00:27:30.855 --> 00:27:32.577]  See, they do that to neutralize opposition.
[00:27:32.597 --> 00:27:33.838]  They deny it as long as they can.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:39.605]  Gordon Brown, the new Prime Minister of England, has been saying there was no plan to sign England into the EU.
[00:27:40.166 --> 00:27:41.087]  He just did it this week.
[00:27:42.088 --> 00:27:44.271]  See, deny, deny, deny, deny, right up until the point.
[00:27:47.049 --> 00:27:51.151]  Experts dismiss agenda as futile, barbaric scheme that will increase human suffering.
[00:27:51.171 --> 00:27:51.932]  That's the whole point of it.
[00:27:52.352 --> 00:28:10.203]  The UN has officially announced that the fear-mongering about man-made global warming has been designed to justify, all along, a global carbon tax, which will do nothing to reduce carbon emissions, but everything to feed... Yeah, even if you believe that man-made carbon is bad, this doesn't reduce it, it actually increases it, because the third world makes no cuts, all energy will move there.
[00:28:10.683 --> 00:28:16.086]  A global carbon tax will do nothing to reduce carbon emissions, but everything to feed the trom of world government.
[00:28:16.923 --> 00:28:26.354]  One of over a hundred prominent scientists signed a letter dismissing the move, over a hundred did, as a futile barbaric scheme which will diminish prosperity and increase human suffering.
[00:28:26.714 --> 00:28:37.607]  Following a discussion entitled, A Global CO2 Tax, that's the UN's document, a UN panel yesterday urged the adoption of a global burden sharing system
[00:28:39.315 --> 00:28:45.499]  Fair with solidarity and legally binding to all nations to impose a tax on plant food, CO2.
[00:28:45.579 --> 00:28:51.482]  Now let me read a quote from the UN document, which we have a link to.
[00:28:51.902 --> 00:28:53.643]  A global CO2 tax.
[00:28:53.983 --> 00:28:55.004]  That's what it's called.
[00:28:55.284 --> 00:28:57.245]  Global tax, okay?
[00:28:58.026 --> 00:28:59.967]  In the trillions of dollars.
[00:29:01.149 --> 00:29:02.910]  This is to fund global government.
[00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:16.435]  They're proposing hundreds of new taxes, and now both parties say they're going to adopt it, and the SPP documents from September 2006 state that they wanted to have a stealth implementation of carbon tax through the NAU.
[00:29:17.535 --> 00:29:20.096]  But they know you won't go to Judicial Watch and read it.
[00:29:20.416 --> 00:29:25.878]  They know you won't get in-game blueprint for global enslavement that has the North American Union governmental chart.
[00:29:26.959 --> 00:29:27.519]  They know
[00:29:28.416 --> 00:29:30.997]  That they can just tell you it doesn't exist, and it won't.
[00:29:33.559 --> 00:29:37.000]  Now there's another story I haven't even gotten to yet that is so unbelievable it's off the chart.
[00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:38.121]  I didn't believe it when I saw it.
[00:29:38.201 --> 00:29:38.962]  It is sourced.
[00:29:39.742 --> 00:29:41.983]  Mobile labs to target Iraqis for death.
[00:29:42.223 --> 00:29:46.926]  They're bringing mobile death trucks, like they have in China, to Iraq.
[00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:50.528]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, hell is being released.
[00:29:52.128 --> 00:29:53.129]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.509 --> 00:29:55.010]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:58.703]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.815 --> 00:30:09.301]  Hi, I'm Lynette Brooks, founder of MediCleanse, the original colon cleanse combining the healing power of flaxseed with the detoxification of bentonite clay.
[00:30:09.621 --> 00:30:15.625]  In a perfect world, we would eat natural healthy foods, but the foods we eat today are not the foods nature intended for us.
[00:30:16.086 --> 00:30:17.747]  Fast food is toxic food.
[00:30:18.147 --> 00:30:21.770]  I've been producing MediCleanse for over 20 years, and customers from across the U.S.
[00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:30.076]  say that MediCleanse helps your body detoxify from fast foods as well as other environmental poisons, such as heavy metals and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:30:30.456 --> 00:30:32.997]  For centuries, flax has been known as nature's superfood.
[00:30:33.478 --> 00:30:40.521]  Even the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:45.003]  A one-month supply of MediCleanse is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[00:30:45.123 --> 00:30:50.966]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com for only $22.95 plus shipping and handling.

[00:31:20.495 --> 00:31:23.757]  Spyville.com also carries a wide variety of night vision scopes.
[00:31:23.857 --> 00:31:24.397]  I don't think so.
[00:31:43.366 --> 00:31:44.868]  Christmas is coming so don't delay!
[00:31:44.928 --> 00:31:46.330]  Go to Spyville.com.

[00:31:50.694 --> 00:31:51.055]  Spyville dot com.
[00:31:51.075 --> 00:31:52.717]  Where your personal security and well-being is our goal.
[00:32:01.696 --> 00:32:03.397]  Do you need an easier way to stay in touch?
[00:32:03.657 --> 00:32:05.358]  A two-way radio may be for you.
[00:32:05.538 --> 00:32:09.560]  Two-way radios provide short-range communication with no recurring service charges.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.822]  Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and skiing.
[00:32:12.982 --> 00:32:16.824]  Great for amusement parks, cruises, or just keeping up with the kids around the neighborhood.
[00:32:16.964 --> 00:32:19.365]  Two-way radios can also make your business more efficient.
[00:32:19.485 --> 00:32:25.768]  Cut costs while increasing productivity in doctor and dental offices, restaurants, retail, warehouses, construction, and more.
[00:32:25.868 --> 00:32:29.770]  TWRadios.com is the Internet's leading two-way radio provider.
[00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:30.150]  I think so.
[00:32:52.208 --> 00:32:57.429]  That's 800-584-1445 or online at TWRadios.com.
[00:32:57.569 --> 00:33:00.930]  Keeping in contact has never been easier or more affordable.
[00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:17.573]  There is still time, ladies and gentlemen, to get your orders in at M4Wars.com in the secure online video and bookstore shopping cart.
[00:33:18.624 --> 00:33:27.392]  There's still time to get Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, to get my film Martial Law that documents the police state, 9-11, and of course the Bush-Nazi connection.
[00:33:28.153 --> 00:33:31.336]  There's still time to get Loose Change Final Cut that I executive produced.
[00:33:31.917 --> 00:33:33.378]  There's time to order it right now.
[00:33:33.478 --> 00:33:39.484]  Everything that comes in through Sunday, up until midnight, Monday morning, will be shipped out on Monday.
[00:33:39.504 --> 00:33:40.965]  And anywhere in the U.S.
[00:33:41.025 --> 00:33:43.528]  on UPS, you should be getting it before Christmas.
[00:33:44.318 --> 00:33:48.899]  A lot of areas will get it by Thursday or Friday, but up in Alaska and places, you'll probably get it on Monday.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.080]  Now is the time to spread the word.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:59.923]  When you get a copy of Endgame, when you get a copy of Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, feel free to make copies for non-profit educational purposes.
[00:34:00.283 --> 00:34:01.584]  Feel free to get them out to people.
[00:34:01.704 --> 00:34:05.645]  Also, in the month of December, we're giving you five months free.
[00:34:05.705 --> 00:34:11.867]  When you sign up for a year and pay for like six and a half months or so, you get five plus months free.
[00:34:12.728 --> 00:34:16.932]  It comes out to 5.3 months free when you sign up for a year at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:34:17.352 --> 00:34:28.022]  That comes out to like four bucks a month for all 17 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book online, hundreds of my weekly TV reports, just so much more at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:34:30.549 --> 00:34:36.473]  You can also call by phone and order the books and videos, and you can also have us drop ship them.
[00:34:36.513 --> 00:34:41.796]  Just put in the information of where you want your order sent, and we will mail it to them.
[00:34:42.097 --> 00:34:55.045]  If you put in the comment section an email, a comment to, hey Bob, here's Endgame, hey Carol, or hey brother, hey mama, hey daddy, hey son, and find enclosed Endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:34:55.525 --> 00:34:58.049]  That's a good idea to do that too so they know why they got it.
[00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:07.502]  Or send them an email or call them on Christmas morning and say, hey, you know, that video that just came in the mail yesterday or Saturday, I sent that to you.
[00:35:07.722 --> 00:35:09.384]  You can also do that at InfoWars.com or
[00:35:12.668 --> 00:35:17.890]  By going to PrisonPlanet.tv, we've got links to the shopping cart there as well.
[00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:21.551]  You can also give folks membership to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:21.571 --> 00:35:22.471]  The toll-free number is 888-253-3139.
[00:35:22.491 --> 00:35:22.571]  888-253-3139.
[00:35:22.591 --> 00:35:27.953]  I also know that Amazon.com has even faster shipping than we do, but they only carry in-game and TerrorStorm.
[00:35:36.535 --> 00:35:43.016]  And you can go order there, and they've got regional shipping offices in every region of the US.
[00:35:43.376 --> 00:35:45.177]  They can ship right now, two-day, to you.
[00:35:45.737 --> 00:35:49.538]  And so you can also order Terror Storm or Endgame via Amazon.com.
[00:35:49.978 --> 00:36:00.160]  There's something else you can order there, and that is her new book, Naomi Wolf's new book, that is, of course, doing quite well, and that is The End of America.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:00.940]  So while you're at it,
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:07.082]  I suggest that you go to Amazon.com and get that for yourself or send that to someone as a Christmas present.
[00:36:07.602 --> 00:36:08.262]  Use Christmas.
[00:36:08.402 --> 00:36:12.823]  Use the holiday giving season as an excuse to educate your friends and family.
[00:36:13.143 --> 00:36:14.864]  This is how we're going to beat the New World Order.
[00:36:15.344 --> 00:36:25.266]  Or you can simply send them an email and say, hey, for Christmas, check out the free podcast of the three-hour radio show so they can listen how they want, when they want at InfoWars.com.
[00:36:25.586 --> 00:36:28.107]  Now going to Naomi Wolf, her bio,
[00:36:29.099 --> 00:36:36.883]  She is lengthy, she is a best-selling author of multiple books, and she is our guest today.
[00:36:36.943 --> 00:36:55.033]  Naomi, instead of myself going through, for ten minutes, your bio, tell folks a little bit about yourself, and then I want to recap the ten steps towards fascism that you cover in your new book, The End of America, and then get into some of the other issues we didn't discuss when you were on with us two weeks ago.
[00:36:56.135 --> 00:36:56.375]  Sure.
[00:36:56.435 --> 00:36:57.637]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[00:36:57.777 --> 00:37:06.507]  Well, I'm the mother of two, and let's see, I got a degree from Yale, a graduate degree, or I'm sorry, not a degree, graduate studies at Oxford.
[00:37:06.527 --> 00:37:07.969]  I was a Rhodes Scholar.
[00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:09.932]  I did write six books.
[00:37:10.512 --> 00:37:12.655]  Luckily, some of them have been international bestsellers.
[00:37:13.243 --> 00:37:33.353]  I'm really happy, and usually I write about gender issues, but the emergency we're in called me to write the most recent book about the crisis facing us, as there's this intense subversion of democracy, and what I saw has echoed from history, from an early 20th century totalitarian and fascist history, to put in place this intense depth.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.362]  There would be dictators always used to close down a democracy.
[00:37:36.462 --> 00:37:37.723]  So that's briefly who I am.
[00:37:38.043 --> 00:37:40.205]  Now last time we only got through about nine of them.
[00:37:40.245 --> 00:37:43.067]  We had to hurry because I was always adding comments and so were you.
[00:37:43.427 --> 00:37:52.674]  Run through, you got the floor, the ten steps and then I want to get into the Bush-Nazi connection, your questions about the 9-11 official story and the whole left-right paradigm.
[00:37:52.694 --> 00:37:54.595]  But first, the ten steps, what your book covers.
[00:37:55.473 --> 00:37:55.753]  Sure.
[00:37:55.773 --> 00:38:04.301]  And can I just say, Alex, I'm pleased to be talking with you again because apparently I got in trouble for talking with you last time.
[00:38:04.602 --> 00:38:06.243]  And I really believe in a democracy.
[00:38:07.144 --> 00:38:10.467]  There should be nothing, you know, no questions that citizens have that are off limits.
[00:38:10.687 --> 00:38:11.068]  So, yeah.
[00:38:11.588 --> 00:38:13.069]  What do you mean you got in trouble?
[00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:19.796]  Well, I did some right-wing radio, which again I'm happy to do because I'm eager to reach out to people across the political spectrum.
[00:38:19.856 --> 00:38:21.017]  I think that's what democracy is about.
[00:38:21.537 --> 00:38:28.782]  And a couple of very prominent right-wing radio hosts yelled at me for talking to you, because that's supposed to be beyond the pale.
[00:38:28.882 --> 00:38:30.544]  So I'm delighted to be talking to you again.
[00:38:30.744 --> 00:38:33.746]  Was one of them Lord Medved?
[00:38:34.386 --> 00:38:36.328]  Yes, Michael Medved yelled at me.
[00:38:36.368 --> 00:38:43.373]  Yeah, the guy that publicly goes to the White House and publicly is videotaped and photographed getting marching orders from Bush.
[00:38:43.393 --> 00:38:43.913]  You mean that guy?
[00:38:44.981 --> 00:38:46.002]  Well, I don't know about that.
[00:38:46.422 --> 00:38:47.803]  Oh yeah, that was in the New York Times.
[00:38:47.823 --> 00:38:48.624]  Remember last year?
[00:38:48.644 --> 00:38:53.167]  They went and all the neocon hosts.
[00:38:53.427 --> 00:38:54.107]  What did he say to you?
[00:38:54.127 --> 00:38:55.528]  I got an email about it, but I didn't hear it.
[00:38:56.909 --> 00:38:59.911]  Oh, you know, I don't want to get into mudslinging.
[00:39:02.995 --> 00:39:12.349]  I guess his position is that some of what you believe is at the far reaches of the conventional discourse... Oh, he has said that I'm treasonous!
[00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:13.671]  Oh, really?
[00:39:13.771 --> 00:39:14.171]  Treason?
[00:39:14.192 --> 00:39:16.054]  He's throwing the treason word around at you?
[00:39:16.074 --> 00:39:17.036]  Well, that's step number eight.
[00:39:18.071 --> 00:39:18.852]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:39:18.872 --> 00:39:24.614]  But anyway, I strongly believe, and I'll say it again, that in a democracy, there are no questions citizens have that are off-limits.
[00:39:24.634 --> 00:39:26.535]  There's no conversation that should be off-limits.
[00:39:26.875 --> 00:39:36.400]  We've got the First Amendment, and that, you know, I personally believe people should talk across all kinds of party lines and belief systems to enrich our discussions.
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.441]  So I'm delighted to be talking to you in your community.
[00:39:38.521 --> 00:39:39.001]  Ha ha ha.
[00:39:40.722 --> 00:39:42.423]  Well, I'm delighted, too.
[00:39:42.523 --> 00:39:42.923]  Thank you.
[00:39:43.043 --> 00:39:44.484]  So, shall I go through the ten steps?
[00:39:44.804 --> 00:39:45.685]  Absolutely.
[00:39:45.705 --> 00:39:49.867]  Yeah, we had a fantastic conversation last time, and I'm so happy to be picking it up again.
[00:39:50.208 --> 00:39:54.030]  So, the first step, as we mentioned, is that all would-be dictators.
[00:39:54.130 --> 00:40:07.538]  And again, I looked at Germany in the 30s, Russia in the 30s, Italy in the 20s, East Germany in the 50s, Czechoslovakia in the 60s, China's coup in Chile in 1973, and China's crackdown against democracy in the late 80s.
[00:40:08.519 --> 00:40:18.371]  Um, so the first step everyone takes is to invoke a terrifying internal and external threat and often it's a real threat that the would-be dictator will hype or manipulate.
[00:40:19.091 --> 00:40:22.055]  The second thing all would-be dictators do is to create a
[00:40:23.172 --> 00:40:23.553]  I think?
[00:40:38.837 --> 00:40:48.212]  That is not answerable to the people and this is very effective because they send that tactically to kind of intimidate the population even when they're still a democratic civil society.
[00:40:48.873 --> 00:40:52.920]  The fourth thing they do is they create a surveillance apparatus aimed at ordinary citizens
[00:40:53.573 --> 00:40:54.033]  Thank you.
[00:41:13.843 --> 00:41:16.965]  The sixth thing they do is target key individuals.
[00:41:17.005 --> 00:41:27.654]  I was just saying the ACLU has multiple lawsuits because agents of the state are infiltrating so many, you know, benign civilian groups, anti-war groups, environmental groups and so on.
[00:41:28.574 --> 00:41:34.439]  So they'll target key individuals and that means people like Dan Rather who lost his job.
[00:41:34.904 --> 00:41:36.645]  When he ran a report critical of Bush.
[00:41:36.686 --> 00:41:39.468]  People like Bill Maher, who lost his job when he said something.
[00:41:39.988 --> 00:41:44.712]  The Dixie Chicks, who had these orchestrated burnings of their CDs and their careers were at stake.
[00:41:45.072 --> 00:41:55.320]  And then, you know, the targeting goes from smears and political, I'm sorry, professional repercussions to, you know, arrests and investigations.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:59.244]  We're seeing this politician in Alabama got railroaded.
[00:41:59.284 --> 00:41:59.704]  We're seeing
[00:42:00.103 --> 00:42:00.503]  Thank you.
[00:42:18.431 --> 00:42:19.672]  We're good to go.
[00:42:39.776 --> 00:42:43.597]  I'm getting speeches about the First Amendment and closed down dissent for a decade.
[00:42:44.557 --> 00:42:54.000]  Let's see, the ninth thing that happens, you just mentioned it, is that criticism gets recast as treason and dissent as espionage.
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:43:02.903]  And that's when you start to see things like, this is right out of Hitler's playbook and Stalin's playbook, you start to see things like, let's see, it's called H.R.
[00:43:02.923 --> 00:43:05.844]  1959, the bill that passed by 404 to a handful out of
[00:43:07.734 --> 00:43:13.317]  The House is now going to the Senate, which would basically criminalize conversations like this.
[00:43:13.337 --> 00:43:14.558]  It would criminalize thought.
[00:43:14.958 --> 00:43:22.902]  It would criminalize, you know, a blog I wrote yesterday saying that we should appoint a special prosecutor to investigate what happened to the missing CIA tape.
[00:43:23.523 --> 00:43:30.827]  When that law passes, God forbid, you know, it'll in a way be over because any of us can be kind of
[00:43:31.537 --> 00:43:42.019]  Round it up and arrest it and face a great deal of difficulty for thinking things, for saying things, which is a hallmark of a closing society, what I call a fascist shift.
[00:43:42.419 --> 00:43:48.500]  The last step is to make it easier to declare martial law and to subvert the rule of law.
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:53.561]  And there are a number of ways to close things down with the final step.
[00:43:53.581 --> 00:43:58.202]  You don't always need a march on Rome like in Italy in 1920 or Night of the Long Knives.
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:43:59.201]  I don't know.
[00:44:13.422 --> 00:44:16.184]  that are being subpoenaed would indicate that they wanted to do.
[00:44:16.244 --> 00:44:17.024]  Goebbels did this in 1933.
[00:44:17.144 --> 00:44:27.010]  Because then you can have an election, but, you know, if all your guys are deciding the outcome or deciding who to prosecute in terms of voter registration, the outcome is foreordained.
[00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:35.534]  Or you can deploy Blackwater, for instance, who now has a presence in Illinois and is trying to build a presence in San Diego to monitor the border.
[00:44:35.995 --> 00:44:39.116]  Or you can federalize the National Guard, which the Defense Authorization Act of 2007
[00:44:40.399 --> 00:44:52.886]  Essentially did giving the president alone the power to declare martial law and tell you know send the National Guard of one state out to subdue the citizens of another state without the consent of the governors of either state and tell Congress about it after the fact.
[00:44:53.186 --> 00:44:57.068]  So we are in a terrible crisis because all these 10 steps are in place now.
[00:44:57.908 --> 00:45:05.493]  Absolutely, and I would say from my knowledge of those 10 steps, that you're even erring on the side of caution.
[00:45:05.993 --> 00:45:10.196]  And as bad as what you talked about sounds, it's actually much worse.
[00:45:10.236 --> 00:45:17.340]  On the martial law front, Presidential Decision Directive 51, Bush says he is above Congress and his Supreme Dictator.
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:23.204]  All of these memos have been coming out where they say the President decides what is constitutional.
[00:45:23.968 --> 00:45:25.809]  No, I didn't advise the Clinton White House.
[00:45:44.824 --> 00:45:46.907]  Sure, I'll tell you, but let me just step back a minute.
[00:45:46.947 --> 00:46:00.306]  When you mentioned Presidential Directive 51, if that's the name of it, I just want to note that a crucial turning point in the closing down of Germany, which had been a parliamentary democracy, was when Hitler passed a law that essentially gave him the same powers.
[00:46:02.147 --> 00:46:10.333]  Absolutely, but I've seen you on television places talk about how you know the Clintons, and you say that they're good folks who really want to help people.
[00:46:10.973 --> 00:46:12.534]  And Naomi, I think you're a good person.
[00:46:12.574 --> 00:46:18.418]  I think you're very intelligent, and I've read some of your books and a lot of your writings, and I believe you mean well, and I believe you're very intelligent.
[00:46:18.438 --> 00:46:23.922]  But specifically, and this isn't some Clinton bash fest, I want to talk about the left-right paradigm here for a moment.
[00:46:23.942 --> 00:46:29.085]  I saw you at a meeting where there were obviously a lot of leftists even asking you, well, hey, aren't the Clintons bad too?
[00:46:30.746 --> 00:46:31.687]  What did you do with the Clintons?
[00:46:32.247 --> 00:46:38.391]  Yeah, let me be super, super clear so I'm not overstating, you know, my knowledge or participation.
[00:46:39.191 --> 00:46:40.172]  I know them slightly.
[00:46:40.652 --> 00:46:55.260]  My children's father knows them intimately because he wrote a number of President Clinton speeches and Mrs. Clinton speeches during the, I believe, second Clinton, first and second Clinton term.
[00:46:56.841 --> 00:46:59.843]  And so every day he was working with them, so I watched the
[00:47:00.413 --> 00:47:00.913]  Yes, I think so.
[00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:26.294]  You know, the kinds of compromises that people make when they're engaging with this really horrible power structure.
[00:47:26.314 --> 00:47:29.357]  Let me just explain why I brought this up.
[00:47:29.477 --> 00:47:29.957]  It's this.
[00:47:30.678 --> 00:47:44.790]  I mean, a lot of people, what you'd call from the traditional left, they're well-meaning, they're caring people, they really believe in what they're doing, they're right on a lot of issues, wrong on some other issues from my constitutionalist slash libertarian perspective, historically.
[00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:49.814]  The reason I raise this is, I've been talking about the police state since I got on there 13 years ago.
[00:47:50.374 --> 00:47:53.836]  I knew about civilian inmate labor camp programs when they were declassified in 97.
[00:47:54.856 --> 00:47:58.218]  They've been going on for a decade with prisoners being taken to military bases.
[00:47:58.638 --> 00:47:59.718]  I knew about all these things.
[00:47:59.978 --> 00:48:14.205]  And before Bill Clinton, before Jimmy Carter, the apparatus of the military-industrial complex and the defense contractors controlled by the big central banks of the world and the Fortune 100 were already writing white papers wanting to build up
[00:48:14.925 --> 00:48:15.126]  I don't
[00:48:30.337 --> 00:48:31.018]  I think so.
[00:48:50.976 --> 00:48:53.657]  And you're bringing your great gravitas and acumen to this.
[00:48:54.158 --> 00:49:12.866]  My issue is, I'm telling you from my research, it's crystal clear, this is a larger underlying agenda by the bureaucracy, by the global corporate interest, and so I'm just hoping we can get people like yourself to shift this out of just a George Bush discussion into a larger discussion.
[00:49:13.431 --> 00:49:36.816]  Well, that's fascinating, Alex, because, you know, the conclusion you're reaching, you're sort of meeting the extreme left, you know, where a number of them have gone, when they, you know, people who like protest the World Trade Organization, and who basically say that democracy is a sort of thin cover for corporate interests, which are sort of the moving powers in the global, not only economy, but political sphere now, and that everything else is just window dressing.
[00:49:36.836 --> 00:49:38.756]  I mean, I was just reading Chalmers Johnson.
[00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:39.530]  I don't know.
[00:49:54.633 --> 00:50:02.077]  And, like, what can you do when you, you know, reach that sense of, well, there's bedrock here of these interests that are, you know, unassailable.
[00:50:02.117 --> 00:50:11.603]  Naomi, I think we have to assess just how bad it really is, or any fixes, or blaming it all just on Bush instead of the underlying cause.
[00:50:11.663 --> 00:50:12.843]  I mean, I want to stop this.
[00:50:12.923 --> 00:50:14.044]  I want to reverse it.
[00:50:14.784 --> 00:50:14.925]  Right.
[00:50:15.525 --> 00:50:16.946]  Well, okay, I just want to say one thing.
[00:50:17.406 --> 00:50:21.048]  When I was watching the Clinton terms close up, and when I was working
[00:50:21.742 --> 00:50:31.550]  On the Gore campaign, formally, not doing what the RNC, you know, mythically spun that I was doing, which was sort of some weird wardrobe thing, but advising women's issues and getting out the youth vote.
[00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:41.037]  I did see that people who are engaging in democracy were able to pass some good laws and constrain some excesses.
[00:50:41.637 --> 00:50:44.859]  Oh, there's no doubt that the citizens have power and that we're in the game.
[00:50:44.899 --> 00:50:49.301]  I'm not saying it's all over and, you know, they have total air superiority.
[00:50:49.762 --> 00:50:54.624]  I'm just saying we need to assess that this is, both parties, this is system-wide.
[00:50:55.084 --> 00:50:59.927]  Bush is just the most virulent manifestation of an overall illness.
[00:51:00.247 --> 00:51:01.268]  Naomi Wolf, stay with us.
[00:51:02.268 --> 00:51:03.669]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:05.790]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.531 --> 00:51:10.033]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a power.
[00:51:11.403 --> 00:51:13.585]  It's known as the Bilderberg Conflict.
[00:51:14.225 --> 00:51:16.466]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:17.007 --> 00:51:19.448]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[00:51:20.189 --> 00:51:27.514]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.529 --> 00:51:35.512]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.993 --> 00:51:39.455]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.835 --> 00:51:42.377]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:42.417 --> 00:51:43.558]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.578 --> 00:51:44.358]  They're not after money.
[00:51:44.378 --> 00:51:45.439]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.659 --> 00:51:46.440]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.660]  That's what they're after, you see.

[00:51:59.308 --> 00:52:00.349]  You have been warned.
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:04.642]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:04.682 --> 00:52:08.725]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:08.865 --> 00:52:11.407]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:11.487 --> 00:52:13.788]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:13.989 --> 00:52:22.434]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:22.514 --> 00:52:23.815]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:52:23.955 --> 00:52:27.978]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:28.458]  We're good to go!

[00:54:13.078 --> 00:54:15.179]  I want to shift gears with Naomi Wolf.
[00:54:15.459 --> 00:54:19.900]  Lawyers for victims of 9-11 and people in the surrounding area are bringing forward evidence.
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:34.823]  We already knew this, but Christina Todd Whitman reported to the White House that it was horrible asbestos, mercury dust, the thousands of mercury switches in the thermostats, the computers, very toxic.
[00:54:35.803 --> 00:54:37.143]  Tens of thousands of computers.
[00:54:38.243 --> 00:54:38.744]  I don't know.
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:58.520]  And Bush told her to suppress it.
[00:54:58.581 --> 00:55:00.341]  And that's now been declassified.
[00:55:00.381 --> 00:55:01.101]  That's now come out.
[00:55:01.441 --> 00:55:09.924]  They took the bodies, the remains of half the victims, or 47% of the victims, and they put them in the landfill, then used that for aggregate to fill potholes, Associated Press.
[00:55:10.424 --> 00:55:11.584]  Naomi, of course, lives there.
[00:55:11.624 --> 00:55:16.526]  Her son got asthma after all this happened, and you can put two and two together.
[00:55:16.906 --> 00:55:21.707]  So, I mean, just from that perspective of them lying to us, you say you have some questions about 9-11.
[00:55:23.067 --> 00:55:24.988]  Can you talk about, first off, the dust?
[00:55:25.734 --> 00:55:30.837]  Well, let me just be super clear again because there are so many people waiting to take things out of context.
[00:55:31.357 --> 00:55:48.568]  I know that, you know, my son was a few blocks away from Ground Zero and stayed there because, you know, Christy Whitman said the air is safe to breathe and I couldn't believe at that time that the government lied to us about something so substantial and I know that my son, you know, does have, you know, breathing problems.
[00:55:49.258 --> 00:55:50.619]  But I don't know.
[00:55:50.639 --> 00:56:06.669]  I don't have a smoking gun to say that one leads to the next, although I can say my mother's instinct, and I've said this in public, felt that it wasn't safe to be in the area, that it was something very, very toxic going on.
[00:56:07.029 --> 00:56:12.252]  And I'm, of course, sorry now that we didn't err on the side of caution and move the children out of the city during that time.
[00:56:14.512 --> 00:56:25.014]  But, I mean, now we've had hundreds and hundreds of firefighters and police and medical workers have died, and we have the media still kind of playing that down.
[00:56:25.094 --> 00:56:33.196]  I mean, the cold-bloodedness of just telling everybody in all those dozens of schools in the area and hundreds of businesses, thousands of businesses, that it's safe.
[00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:37.297]  I mean, again, that illustrates just the ruthlessness of these people.
[00:56:37.917 --> 00:56:39.617]  Well, there, I do have to agree with you.
[00:56:39.677 --> 00:56:43.998]  I mean, though I don't know that one caused the other, I do know that it is
[00:56:44.577 --> 00:56:44.977]  Yes, I think.
[00:57:01.889 --> 00:57:05.550]  I'm not happy that I breached all that stuff, you know, that my loved ones did.
[00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:12.092]  I mean, you know, people were wearing, you know, masks outside, and our children were wearing masks.
[00:57:12.132 --> 00:57:15.073]  And then at a certain point, it's like Chrissy Whitman says, you don't have to wear the mask.
[00:57:15.093 --> 00:57:16.253]  Okay, we'll take our masks off.
[00:57:16.313 --> 00:57:21.434]  And that was sort of really a brutal, cold-hearted, devastating moment.
[00:57:21.755 --> 00:57:23.875]  So when, you know, in terms of 9-11, all I know is that
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:50.394]  I've gone across the country and I've met a lot of people talking about these issues and I have met a lot of very serious, credible, sensible people with various knowledge bases who would like more information or who have a sense of unease or who feel like more questions need to be asked and more responsibly answered about
[00:57:51.098 --> 00:57:58.701]  You know, that whole narrative, and I do feel, and I've said this in public and I'll say it again, you know, 60% I think of citizens in the U.S.
[00:57:58.741 --> 00:58:06.284]  now think that we're not getting the whole truth from the government, and so that's a substantial amount of unease, and that's not a good sign in a democracy.
[00:58:06.804 --> 00:58:12.286]  Naomi Wolf, we've got, well we're going to come back in the next little five minute segment and talk about it, but
[00:58:13.488 --> 00:58:15.290]  I just want to point out a few things for you about 9-11.
[00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:30.061]  I mean, I'm sure you're probably really aware of them, and you're valiantly in your prominent position even hinting at this, but, or your questions, but we need to discuss government-sponsored terror, which has been declassified hundreds of times just by our government.
[00:58:30.401 --> 00:58:37.827]  When we get back, then we're also going to talk about solutions to this whole police state that's being set up.
[00:58:38.227 --> 00:58:39.949]  We'll be back with Naomi Wolf in 70 seconds.
[00:58:43.283 --> 00:58:46.226]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:15.504 --> 00:59:19.065]  Naomi Wolf, multiple time New York Times bestseller.
[00:59:20.686 --> 00:59:24.770]  New book, The End of America, The Ten Steps Towards Fascism.
[00:59:24.931 --> 00:59:26.092]  Actual handbooks on it.
[00:59:26.712 --> 00:59:31.237]  Our criminal government's taught the world how to do it for decades, showing it's bipartisan.
[00:59:32.038 --> 00:59:38.785]  Now they are using it right here, setting up a Pentagon-designed, MIT-designed control grid, the cameras, the face scanners.
[00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:42.372]  The National ID cards, all of it going into place.
[00:59:42.933 --> 00:59:43.994]  Naomi Wolf is our guest.
[00:59:44.034 --> 00:59:47.339]  Naomi, in this short segment, we've got you for the rest of the long segment coming up.
[00:59:47.399 --> 00:59:50.122]  Again, we're very honored and thankful for you coming on with us.
[00:59:50.142 --> 00:59:51.424]  By the way, I've now had time to read your book.
[00:59:51.464 --> 00:59:51.985]  It's excellent.
[00:59:53.732 --> 00:59:57.995]  And coming from your respected, you know, research and name, it's just such a help to try to turn the tide on this.
[00:59:58.015 --> 00:59:59.897]  I'm going to talk about solutions in the next segment.
[01:00:00.437 --> 01:00:10.005]  The CIA was running drills of flying hijacked jets into the exact same targets at the exact same time that day, and the drills caused NORAD to be confused and basically stand down.
[01:00:10.345 --> 01:00:11.446]  Cheney was in the bunker.
[01:00:11.486 --> 01:00:15.209]  We've talked to Mineta two times since then, Transportation Secretary.
[01:00:15.249 --> 01:00:17.491]  He said, no, Cheney was in there and did order a stand down.
[01:00:18.363 --> 01:00:23.906]  We have Mohammed out of the supposed lead hijacker trained at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, trained at the Defense Language School.
[01:00:24.286 --> 01:00:29.148]  Sources, AP, San Jose Mercury News, Colonel Butler, the head of the school, said they trained him.
[01:00:29.608 --> 01:00:33.850]  I've talked to the two embassy heads, both from Ottawa and from Riyadh, U.S.
[01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:35.331]  officers, State Department officials.
[01:00:36.071 --> 01:00:39.873]  One of them, Mr. Springman, who was ordered to let the hijackers back in the U.S.
[01:00:40.153 --> 01:00:45.556]  when they were flagged as Al-Qaeda, and they were told that Al-Qaeda designation is their CIA cover.
[01:00:46.485 --> 01:00:49.367]  I'm just listing a few of hundreds of smoking guns.
[01:00:50.247 --> 01:00:52.408]  And then we have Operation Northwoods, the official U.S.
[01:00:52.428 --> 01:00:58.252]  government plan to hijack jets, bomb D.C., commit sniper attacks, frame patsies, attack U.S.
[01:00:58.292 --> 01:01:00.133]  military bases with U.S.
[01:01:00.153 --> 01:01:01.994]  troops dressed up like Soviet forces.
[01:01:04.415 --> 01:01:06.356]  Gulf of Tonkin now admitted to be staged.
[01:01:07.288 --> 01:01:08.809]  Declassified the U.S.
[01:01:08.849 --> 01:01:10.190]  staged terror attacks in Europe.
[01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:13.851]  The former Italian President's gone public about 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:01:14.112 --> 01:01:15.892]  Former head of the German Parliament's gone public.
[01:01:16.313 --> 01:01:18.013]  I mean, I'm just listing a few of these things.
[01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:22.116]  Former CIA Section Chief of Europe, Bill Christensen's gone public.
[01:01:22.176 --> 01:01:23.376]  Robert Baer on this show.
[01:01:23.716 --> 01:01:24.817]  Movie Siriana's about him.
[01:01:24.837 --> 01:01:27.158]  He's said all the evidence points towards inside job.
[01:01:27.598 --> 01:01:28.839]  I mean, what do you say to that, Naomi?
[01:01:29.502 --> 01:01:45.471]  Well, I guess one thing I say, since, you know, I hang out with people who run the mainstream media and they don't have the sinister motivations that people often attribute to them, is if all of these pieces are so well sourced, why is this not being put together in a more kind of a mainstream context?
[01:01:45.491 --> 01:01:58.199]  That's A. B, and I'm sure you'll tell me in a minute, but my next statement, and I'm again happy to go on the record with this, is that I've been doing a lot of reading about history, whether it's, you know, very well sourced books like Overthrow, which is about American
[01:01:58.695 --> 01:01:59.196]  I don't think so.
[01:02:16.835 --> 01:02:21.257]  A foreign policy goal or even a domestic policy goal that they can't manage otherwise.
[01:02:21.317 --> 01:02:24.458]  And she said that, you know, British colonialism kind of perfected it.
[01:02:24.678 --> 01:02:26.579]  It's just, you know, part of the tool in the toolkit.
[01:02:26.619 --> 01:02:31.500]  And she mentioned a number of incidences, and she said, you know, British colonialism is the teacher for U.S.
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:32.161]  colonialism.
[01:02:32.201 --> 01:02:34.561]  And I know that... What are a few of those examples?
[01:02:34.581 --> 01:02:35.322]  This is intriguing.
[01:02:36.062 --> 01:02:36.782]  It is intriguing.
[01:02:37.082 --> 01:02:43.925]  Well, I'm still researching it, but she mentioned, too, that I can shoot you by email and you can post them once I follow up with her.
[01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:58.495]  In overthrow, you can see a number, and you can look at the regime change in Nicaragua and in the Philippines, and I think Cuba.
[01:02:58.935 --> 01:03:01.696]  And again, I don't have the details to give you right now.
[01:03:01.716 --> 01:03:02.736]  Well, let me just give them to you.
[01:03:02.796 --> 01:03:03.977]  There's over 200 U.S.
[01:03:04.797 --> 01:03:07.818]  declassified examples of where they admit
[01:03:08.456 --> 01:03:11.658]  They blew up school buses, bombed buildings, shot people.
[01:03:11.998 --> 01:03:16.080]  You ever seen the Graham Greene, uh, Graham Greene, Quiet American movie?
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:17.160]  No.
[01:03:17.621 --> 01:03:20.502]  Well, that's fictionalized, but based on real... Are they real?
[01:03:20.682 --> 01:03:20.782]  Yeah.
[01:03:20.802 --> 01:03:21.022]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:21.302 --> 01:03:26.985]  But the movie is, is, is, is, is fictionalized, but it's based on real things that happened in Vietnam.
[01:03:27.725 --> 01:03:33.688]  Where the CIA, early on in the, in the, in the early 60s, they were taking over from the, uh, French and Indochina.
[01:03:34.669 --> 01:03:35.849]  Well, just blow up a market!
[01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:36.910]  And then...
[01:03:37.748 --> 01:03:38.108]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:38.128 --> 01:03:38.848]  A new world order.
[01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:42.069]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[01:04:03.388 --> 01:04:05.149]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:08.451]  Put their objective being world domination.
[01:04:08.992 --> 01:04:11.453]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:12.174 --> 01:04:19.559]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:22.532 --> 01:04:27.516]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:27.976 --> 01:04:31.479]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:31.839 --> 01:04:34.341]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:04:34.421 --> 01:04:35.402]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:35.422 --> 01:04:36.343]  They're not after money.
[01:04:36.363 --> 01:04:37.423]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:37.644 --> 01:04:38.064]  They're after power.
[01:04:38.084 --> 01:04:39.645]  That's what they're after, you see.

[01:05:53.562 --> 01:06:03.185]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[01:06:03.205 --> 01:06:06.626]  Her face was the every face I've ever known.
[01:06:06.646 --> 01:06:08.167]  Her face was my own face.
[01:06:08.527 --> 01:06:09.688]  The enemy of my enemy is my ally.
[01:06:09.728 --> 01:06:12.189]  People should look one another in the eye before they go killing for causes.
[01:06:38.547 --> 01:06:41.908]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:42.048 --> 01:06:43.488]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:03.576 --> 01:07:17.245]  Peter Power, the former head of Scotland Yard Counter Terrorism, was running a drill of the exact same trains being attacked at the exact same time at the exact same locations on 7-7 in 2005.
[01:07:19.867 --> 01:07:22.248]  He's admitted that on BBC and ITN.
[01:07:23.209 --> 01:07:30.434]  He was confronted by We Are Change UK at an event last night, ran from the podium and hid in a closet until they were forced to leave.
[01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:33.692]  That's how scared they are of this info.
[01:07:34.233 --> 01:07:36.654]  We are Change UK is joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:07:36.814 --> 01:07:38.215]  Then we've got Daniel Estelin.
[01:07:38.856 --> 01:07:41.378]  By the way, Naomi, I'm sending you a copy of his new Bilderberg book.
[01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:46.421]  He's been covering Bilderberg for 15 years, joining us from Spain to discuss this.
[01:07:47.442 --> 01:07:58.369]  Naomi Wolf and I, best-selling author now of the new book, of course, The End of America, The Ten Steps Towards Fascism, that are being implemented, available at Amazon.com and bookstores everywhere.
[01:07:58.629 --> 01:08:00.691]  We're talking about, you know, even if it's such a dark
[01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:04.882]  Bleak picture and governments have admitted they've staged events in the past.
[01:08:06.661 --> 01:08:08.122]  She was saying, well, what do we tell people to do?
[01:08:08.142 --> 01:08:09.802]  How do we counter it?
[01:08:10.242 --> 01:08:15.084]  First, you have to admit to yourself and go do the research to find out what I'm saying is true to the listeners.
[01:08:15.645 --> 01:08:17.365]  And then, B, you've got to get over the fear factor.
[01:08:17.805 --> 01:08:20.647]  There's a subconscious fear hanging back even myself.
[01:08:20.767 --> 01:08:29.410]  I had pangs of fear during the last break thinking, my gosh, I'm exposing hardcore murderers who will go wipe out whole villages and blame it on somebody else.
[01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:34.012]  I mean, you know, who will blow up apartment buildings and blame it on somebody else in Latin America or in Russia.
[01:08:34.665 --> 01:08:35.586]  Or in the U.S.
[01:08:35.746 --> 01:08:36.446]  or in England.
[01:08:37.027 --> 01:08:39.128]  And they can come and kill me tomorrow.
[01:08:39.308 --> 01:08:47.093]  But by being vocal, by being up front, by getting out on the field and saying, I'm ready to stand up against you, that gives you the ultimate safety.
[01:08:47.653 --> 01:08:55.158]  If we become like a third world nation and just give in to corruption, give in to police with machine guns on the street corners, third world banana republic, it's over.
[01:08:55.938 --> 01:08:57.719]  And I don't think our police and military want that.
[01:08:57.759 --> 01:08:59.040]  Most of our military are good people.
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:00.481]  Most of our police are good people.
[01:09:00.521 --> 01:09:02.622]  Most intelligence folks are good.
[01:09:02.662 --> 01:09:03.703]  They're compartmentalized.
[01:09:04.156 --> 01:09:12.470]  They're out doing good things or collecting data they think is for good that is then compartmentalized out and then put together down the chain.
[01:09:12.831 --> 01:09:14.013]  I mean, Naomi, here's an example.
[01:09:14.864 --> 01:09:26.071]  I've interviewed a lot of Rhodes Scholars, and most of them, you know, believe in global harmony and love and believe in globalism because, you know, it's everyone working together in community of nations and feeding and helping the poor.
[01:09:26.531 --> 01:09:28.912]  But they haven't actually read the writings of Cecil Rhodes.
[01:09:29.272 --> 01:09:30.913]  So, I mean, there's your answer.
[01:09:30.953 --> 01:09:36.917]  You asked me during the break, why doesn't the media, and I'm not trying to pontificate, but you asked the question, so I'm trying to give you my answer.
[01:09:36.957 --> 01:09:38.217]  I'm not saying it's totally correct.
[01:09:38.278 --> 01:09:38.858]  I want your view.
[01:09:40.297 --> 01:09:48.950]  But, uh, you know, you were saying, well, if this is all documented and sourced, and I'm raising some issues that you've sourced yourself, uh, then why is the mainstream media reporting?
[01:09:49.736 --> 01:09:51.737]  A lot of it is a cage of their own mind.
[01:09:51.777 --> 01:09:52.778]  They're in the system.
[01:09:53.078 --> 01:09:54.920]  They're in the controlled left-right paradigm.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:58.802]  I mean, you're very intelligent, probably a lot smarter than I am, higher IQ.
[01:09:58.822 --> 01:10:02.365]  You know, you're just now learning about a lot of this.
[01:10:03.645 --> 01:10:17.595]  So my point is, there's so much width and breadth of history and sociology and society and the geopolitical strata and makeup that these people don't know about that, and they're within a controlled paradigm.
[01:10:18.115 --> 01:10:19.055]  I mean, does that make any sense?
[01:10:19.635 --> 01:10:22.216]  Yeah, it actually does, and I want to say two things very clearly.
[01:10:22.636 --> 01:10:34.939]  One is that in saying, in my saying, history is full of examples of staged provocations, including in countries like Britain and the U.S., I'm not saying that we know that this was a staged provocation that we're talking about.
[01:10:35.039 --> 01:10:36.099]  I don't know.
[01:10:36.159 --> 01:10:43.781]  What I'm saying is that it is not rational to rule out anything, given how replete the historical record is.
[01:10:44.768 --> 01:10:45.468]  Stop right there!
[01:10:45.628 --> 01:10:46.068]  Plug your blog!
[01:10:46.088 --> 01:10:46.428]  Plug your blog!
[01:11:16.155 --> 01:11:18.877]  Have you read the Army report about them raping them with battery acid?
[01:11:45.106 --> 01:11:46.609]  No, I missed that one.
[01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:49.334]  Read Abu Ghraib General Tugumbu.
[01:11:49.354 --> 01:11:51.577]  He's the Filipino three-star general.
[01:11:51.918 --> 01:11:52.940]  Read his report.
[01:11:53.689 --> 01:11:54.710]  Yeah.
[01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:56.551]  It's public.
[01:11:56.571 --> 01:11:57.551]  These things are horrible.
[01:11:57.731 --> 01:11:59.692]  It's like the archives at Yad Vashem.
[01:12:00.092 --> 01:12:03.534]  The book I was using is documents the ACLU just got from a FOIA request.
[01:12:03.594 --> 01:12:05.075]  It's called Administration of Torture.
[01:12:05.455 --> 01:12:07.917]  I'll certainly go read that, but it's horrific enough.
[01:12:09.017 --> 01:12:15.421]  I don't know if these guys are guilty or innocent, but I do know that guilty or innocent people confess to anything under these circumstances.
[01:12:16.441 --> 01:12:20.444]  All I'm saying is it's not rational to rule things out with that rigorous investigation.
[01:12:20.464 --> 01:12:29.010]  The second thing I want to say, and I'm willing to say this on the record, is that God, you know, there is such a thing as consensus reality.
[01:12:29.050 --> 01:12:29.891]  I'm reading a book called
[01:12:30.333 --> 01:12:43.621]  Extraordinary popular delusions in the madness of crowds, which is an historical account of how, you know, during the witch crazes, people believed that, you know, and they said, you know, all kinds of things that are just not physically possible.
[01:12:43.661 --> 01:12:49.664]  They collectively believed people were flying or that they witnessed, you know, people disappearing or, you know, animals talking.
[01:12:49.684 --> 01:12:53.466]  Mom psychology, militant enthusiasm.
[01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:59.610]  So my only point is I think that there is this tremendous unease about
[01:13:00.251 --> 01:13:02.612]  Questions that haven't been adequately investigated.
[01:13:02.632 --> 01:13:05.273]  It's like in a family where there's a dysfunctional secret.
[01:13:05.693 --> 01:13:10.535]  And in the wake of that, there is this kind of collective consensus not to go there.
[01:13:10.875 --> 01:13:12.736]  And in a democracy, that is not healthy.
[01:13:16.557 --> 01:13:17.337]  What should we do?
[01:13:17.357 --> 01:13:21.679]  I mean, any way you cut it, a government that says torture is good,
[01:13:23.223 --> 01:13:30.548]  A government that's doing everything the bad guys always did and actively trying to sell it to us to use it on a wider scale.
[01:13:30.648 --> 01:13:31.608]  What do we do about this?
[01:13:32.349 --> 01:13:35.491]  Okay, well I agree with you that we urgently need information.
[01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:43.618]  And that's why, you know, I am glad that people are using my book to put the pieces together and see the larger pattern, because we're familiar with all the details.
[01:13:43.698 --> 01:13:47.683]  It's where the larger pattern shows, oh, this is what they did to close down Germany.
[01:13:47.703 --> 01:13:49.104]  This is what they did to close down Italy.
[01:13:49.545 --> 01:13:51.006]  That's a wake-up call.
[01:13:51.066 --> 01:13:58.094]  It gives people the ability to say, wait, no, I'm not going to, you know, be subdued by this war on terror mythology into losing my rights.
[01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:09.314]  The second thing we have to do, and again look at the blog for this, we need to call for a special prosecutor to investigate the crimes of the Bush administration, and rigorously, because history shows that
[01:14:09.872 --> 01:14:11.232]  You know, there are criminals in the White House.
[01:14:11.272 --> 01:14:11.612]  We know that.
[01:14:11.652 --> 01:14:13.553]  There are three levels of crime they've committed.
[01:14:14.253 --> 01:14:18.274]  And history shows that it's not enough to impeach people or wait them out, you know, to leave office.
[01:14:18.594 --> 01:14:22.335]  That people that, you know, I do believe these people are capable of anything at this point.
[01:14:22.435 --> 01:14:26.676]  And history shows that it is only safe to use the law to prosecute such people.
[01:14:26.956 --> 01:14:32.017]  And if San Quiltito locks them up, you know, in America, if you commit a crime, justice has to be done.
[01:14:32.037 --> 01:14:33.917]  So we have to call for that.
[01:14:34.117 --> 01:14:38.398]  And the third thing we have to do is really, and this is almost a spiritual recommitment,
[01:14:38.883 --> 01:14:46.288]  We have to believe, each of us, that we are not going to tolerate this, and that we're not going to collude with it, and we're not going to side with, you know, evil.
[01:14:46.448 --> 01:14:46.989]  That's right.
[01:14:47.469 --> 01:14:48.190]  Very well said.
[01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:50.852]  A daily commitment against tyranny.
[01:14:50.972 --> 01:14:55.195]  A daily commitment to support justice and liberty and transparency.
[01:14:55.655 --> 01:14:59.618]  A daily commitment to realize that tyranny is ancient.
[01:14:59.718 --> 01:15:01.199]  Tyranny is the norm.
[01:15:02.325 --> 01:15:14.332]  Liberty is that rare, holy grail type phantom that is magical and very hard to grasp even when you're educated and informed and valiantly defended.
[01:15:14.592 --> 01:15:19.635]  And we're not going to be able to be a bunch of slovenly Americans taking it for granted and keep it.
[01:15:19.996 --> 01:15:24.338]  And since we've had so much liberty, we don't know what it's like to have bondage.
[01:15:24.358 --> 01:15:27.000]  Oh, you're so right about that.
[01:15:28.587 --> 01:15:33.809]  Yeah, and so what we have to do is kind of wake up to how easy it is to lose our liberty, that we're hanging by a thread at the moment.
[01:15:34.209 --> 01:15:41.031]  And really, it is kind of a personal or emotional or spiritual commitment that then manifests as politics and action.
[01:15:41.071 --> 01:15:45.412]  But, you know, we have to believe in the Founders' vision for ourselves, that we can't wait for someone else.
[01:15:45.952 --> 01:15:49.275]  A pundit class, a professional class, a political class, to defend democracy.
[01:15:49.535 --> 01:15:51.056]  We, each of us, have to rise up.
[01:15:51.076 --> 01:15:53.518]  Well, that's exactly what I've always instinctively said.
[01:15:53.558 --> 01:15:54.379]  This is great to hear.
[01:15:54.739 --> 01:15:57.001]  To defend our republic, to defend our liberty.
[01:15:57.021 --> 01:16:01.224]  I always tell listeners, and they call, Oh, Alex, thank you so much for all you do.
[01:16:01.284 --> 01:16:02.085]  What would we do without you?
[01:16:02.405 --> 01:16:03.906]  Folks, I'm nobody.
[01:16:04.006 --> 01:16:06.128]  The power lies in you moving.
[01:16:06.596 --> 01:16:07.177]  Exactly, right.
[01:16:07.477 --> 01:16:10.940]  And people need to understand they are just as important, if not more so, than you or me.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:19.789]  And the conversations they have with their colleagues, their families, their co-workers, their kids, are as important or more important than this conversation that we're having on the airwaves, absolutely.
[01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:25.454]  Because it's not going to do anything if people just hear what we say and then feel depressed and scared.
[01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:26.334]  Don't be scared.
[01:16:26.835 --> 01:16:28.536]  Feel driven.
[01:16:28.576 --> 01:16:32.559]  I mean, it's kind of like we're knocking on your door and going, hey, your garage is on fire.
[01:16:33.019 --> 01:16:35.160]  You don't just yell and cry and run in the closet.
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.681]  You try to get out of the house.
[01:16:36.722 --> 01:16:37.862]  You call the fire department.
[01:16:38.523 --> 01:16:45.628]  I have to say, I really hope people listening will reach out to, like, where's the church and synagogues and, you know, where are they on this?
[01:16:45.648 --> 01:16:47.229]  Like, people of faith?
[01:16:47.856 --> 01:16:49.957]  I really believe that this is a call for people of faith.
[01:16:49.977 --> 01:16:57.502]  I mean, I happen to believe in God, and you don't have to to take action about this, but I do believe that this is like the United States is being put to a spiritual test right now.
[01:16:57.522 --> 01:17:04.307]  Will we choose to collude with evil, or will we recommit to our really beautiful, virtuous American ideals?
[01:17:04.627 --> 01:17:10.291]  And I do believe that if we can recommit to them on an individual level, I do believe we'll get help from, you know, a higher power.
[01:17:10.311 --> 01:17:10.991]  I do believe that.
[01:17:11.191 --> 01:17:11.511]  Wow!
[01:17:11.591 --> 01:17:12.272]  Providence!
[01:17:12.292 --> 01:17:13.733]  So you're calling on Providence!
[01:17:14.594 --> 01:17:15.975]  Well, it's my personal faith.
[01:17:16.075 --> 01:17:17.016]  No, I agree with you.
[01:17:17.136 --> 01:17:21.559]  Oh, listen, I know that without faith and without that, I mean, that's the deepest level.
[01:17:21.599 --> 01:17:27.122]  Without that realizing that it's something bigger than us just individually, we're going to be worldly and not care.
[01:17:27.363 --> 01:17:29.364]  You've got to have that faith.
[01:17:29.404 --> 01:17:31.926]  I mean, that's what I found at the end of the day.
[01:17:31.946 --> 01:17:34.007]  I think that's right.
[01:17:34.107 --> 01:17:44.314]  And I do see, you know, that lessons of history that when a number of people stand up together and stand up for justice, even when they're vulnerable and they feel weak and they're facing a massive, you know,
[01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:47.114]  Thank you for having me.
[01:17:58.385 --> 01:18:05.267]  The historical record does show that you're right, Alex, that as a society is closing, we are most in danger, all of us, if we remain silent.
[01:18:05.507 --> 01:18:10.809]  But as scary as it is, if more and more of us speak out as society is closing, it is only that that keeps us safe.
[01:18:10.869 --> 01:18:17.791]  And by the way, by society closing, the iron-grated prison bars are sliding down, folks.
[01:18:17.831 --> 01:18:19.231]  The drawbridge is raising up.
[01:18:19.971 --> 01:18:24.773]  And they are publicly... I mean, they say they want to arrest me all the time.
[01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:27.313]  National talk show hosts say it routinely.
[01:18:27.333 --> 01:18:34.496]  I mean, imagine going to sleep at night when people, the 10 million listeners apiece, are on air saying, I need to be arrested.
[01:18:35.236 --> 01:18:37.117]  That's because we're hurting them and we have power.
[01:18:37.137 --> 01:18:39.897]  Naomi, I was going to let you go now, but we've got one more break.
[01:18:40.138 --> 01:18:41.538]  Can you stay with us to the bottom of the hour?
[01:18:42.512 --> 01:18:43.875]  You know, I will try.
[01:18:44.215 --> 01:18:45.618]  I should go back to my little guy.
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:47.200]  I understand.
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:52.129]  Okay, well we've got a three minute break and we'll come right back to you because I just want to finish up with a few other issues.
[01:18:54.085 --> 01:18:55.866]  Ted Anders for Midas, December 14, 2007.
[01:18:56.887 --> 01:19:04.712]  Gold 790, 70 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $814.67, $401.55 per half, $278 per quarter.
[01:19:04.972 --> 01:19:07.154]  That's $814.67, $401.55, and $278.
[01:19:08.374 --> 01:19:11.657]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[01:19:11.917 --> 01:19:16.120]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:20.422]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[01:19:20.803 --> 01:19:22.584]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[01:19:23.104 --> 01:19:24.825]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[01:19:25.085 --> 01:19:31.089]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[01:19:31.509 --> 01:19:38.274]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[01:19:38.614 --> 01:19:39.514]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[01:19:39.554 --> 01:19:40.415]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:45.858 --> 01:19:48.982]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[01:19:49.082 --> 01:19:49.422]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:49.462 --> 01:19:50.864]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[01:20:00.555 --> 01:20:01.275]  We're good to go!

[01:20:32.311 --> 01:20:36.434]  That's 908-691-2608 at hempusa.org.
[01:20:36.594 --> 01:20:41.657]  Remember, vacuum packaging this food will have at least a five-year shelf life stored in a cool, dark, dry place.
[01:20:41.857 --> 01:20:44.999]  Holidays are coming, and this would make a perfect gift for friends and family.
[01:20:45.079 --> 01:20:49.662]  Call today, 908-691-2608 at hempusa.org.
[01:20:49.822 --> 01:20:53.364]  And remember, let your food be your medicine, and your medicine be your food.
[01:20:55.416 --> 01:20:59.177]  As the old saying goes, if you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.
[01:20:59.377 --> 01:21:04.878]  But if you give him a Berkey system, you give him the ability to obtain purified water for a lifetime.
[01:21:05.198 --> 01:21:10.339]  This year, when giving Christmas gifts, instead of unwanted trinkets, give a meaningful and substantial gift.
[01:21:10.599 --> 01:21:15.580]  Berkey systems are ideal for every member of your family, especially the young ones in college.
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:19.401]  Unlike other water filtration systems, Berkey purifiers are portable.
[01:21:19.421 --> 01:21:23.702]  They require no plumbing, and the elements don't have to be replaced every four to six months.
[01:21:24.162 --> 01:21:25.862]  Perfect for anyone on a tight budget.
[01:21:25.982 --> 01:21:30.583]  And more importantly, if there's an unexpected emergency, your loved ones will be prepared.
[01:21:30.923 --> 01:21:34.744]  That's because Berkey Systems are able to purify raw, untreated water.
[01:21:35.124 --> 01:21:37.905]  Check out our Christmas specials at berkeywater.com.
[01:21:38.045 --> 01:21:43.766]  With one of our quantity specials, you not only get a discount, but in one stop, you can get gifts for the entire family.
[01:21:43.846 --> 01:21:45.706]  That's berkeywater.com or call 888-03-4438.
[01:21:45.726 --> 01:21:46.086]  That's 888-03-4438.
[01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:56.552]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[01:21:56.892 --> 01:22:03.799]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:22:04.159 --> 01:22:16.670]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000 year old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[01:22:16.891 --> 01:22:19.533]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[01:22:19.873 --> 01:22:26.057]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[01:22:26.297 --> 01:22:31.441]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now, a small amount is available to my listeners.
[01:22:31.701 --> 01:22:39.946]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.
[01:22:40.166 --> 01:22:40.807]  And the best part?
[01:22:41.027 --> 01:22:43.028]  My listeners pay absolutely nothing today.
[01:22:43.288 --> 01:22:46.470]  Simply go to 321relief.com or call 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:23:03.252 --> 01:23:08.714]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[01:23:08.754 --> 01:23:14.115]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[01:23:14.155 --> 01:23:16.656]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[01:23:16.896 --> 01:23:19.157]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[01:23:19.697 --> 01:23:29.325]  Naomi Wolf, best-selling author, is our guest.
[01:23:29.345 --> 01:23:30.205]  She's so much more.
[01:23:30.225 --> 01:23:33.027]  Just type Naomi Wolf into Google and you can read her bio and the rest of it.
[01:23:35.569 --> 01:23:40.633]  Naomi... 90 plus percent of Americans don't want toll roads on existing roads.
[01:23:40.653 --> 01:23:44.396]  90 plus percent of Americans don't want NAFTA now on all the major poles.
[01:23:44.416 --> 01:23:47.378]  70 to 80 percent, depending on the pole, don't want the war.
[01:23:47.438 --> 01:23:48.239]  It just continues.
[01:23:49.031 --> 01:23:51.553]  And now both parties have got an 11% approval rating.
[01:23:52.073 --> 01:24:04.861]  So the good news is the people are now waking up, not to the full ramifications, but at least they're getting an idea, but the establishment is showing that it isn't going to do what the people are demanding or what's constitutional in this republic.
[01:24:06.382 --> 01:24:08.344]  What do you say to that whole quandary?
[01:24:09.084 --> 01:24:18.110]  That really worries me, Alex, because I'm baffled at why with a Democratic Congress we are getting so little action, given that I know that, you know, the American Freedom Campaign
[01:24:18.575 --> 01:24:24.397]  You know, various partner organizations are harassing them, badgering them, inundating them with phone calls and emails.
[01:24:24.797 --> 01:24:26.337]  You know, what is up with that?
[01:24:26.417 --> 01:24:36.640]  I mean, one reason I speculated about is that in a true surveillance society, which we now have, everyone in Congress, you know, has secrets, and their secrets are completely available to the Bush administration.
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:45.062]  And, you know, as in every closing society in the past, you know, the regime sort of brings legislators records that they're, you know,
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:49.463]  And of course it turns out that the Democratic leaders all got the torture briefings.
[01:24:49.523 --> 01:24:50.324]  They're all in it.
[01:24:50.344 --> 01:24:50.644]  But why?
[01:24:50.664 --> 01:24:52.866]  What would their motivation be?
[01:24:52.926 --> 01:24:54.387]  I think, like you said, fear.
[01:24:54.407 --> 01:24:56.689]  So fear is the big enemy, isn't it?
[01:25:15.578 --> 01:25:20.887]  Yeah, but you would have to argue that these people have been, like, personally threatened or something in order to explain this level.
[01:25:20.907 --> 01:25:25.655]  Well, a lot of it's power and power sharing and profit, but for a lot of others it is blackmail.
[01:25:26.176 --> 01:25:28.560]  I mean, it is enemies list, it is FBI list.
[01:25:29.398 --> 01:25:32.999]  And I think we have to... I don't know if we have... I haven't seen any evidence of that.
[01:25:33.039 --> 01:25:34.339]  I haven't even heard rumors about it.
[01:25:34.699 --> 01:25:41.260]  The rumors... I mean, people who are interfacing with Congressional Democrats say that really it's just a strategy, that they, you know, think they'll win the next election.
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:43.561]  They just want to spit things out and not rock the boat.
[01:25:43.621 --> 01:25:46.341]  Well, Naomi, let's just say it.
[01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:50.582]  I mean, the big war lobbies are in there giving them campaign contributions.
[01:25:50.782 --> 01:25:52.162]  Well, yeah, yeah, that is the truth.
[01:25:52.282 --> 01:25:54.763]  I mean, you know, looking at why Hillary was the last
[01:25:54.923 --> 01:25:56.284]  In closing, the book is The End of America.
[01:26:20.417 --> 01:26:22.279]  I think there is a silver lining in this.
[01:26:22.299 --> 01:26:22.880]  People are waking up.
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:24.702]  Folks like you are speaking out.
[01:26:42.761 --> 01:26:47.684]  But in closing, because you are a Rhodes Scholar, I've got to bring this up, and I'm sure you know why the Rhodes Scholarship was set up.
[01:26:47.704 --> 01:26:50.526]  You know Rhodes did want a global government based on Britannia.
[01:26:50.546 --> 01:26:51.106]  No, I didn't.
[01:26:51.166 --> 01:26:52.147]  I had no idea that.
[01:26:52.187 --> 01:26:53.128]  I've never heard that.
[01:26:53.168 --> 01:26:57.170]  I mean, I knew he was a vicious racist, but I didn't know anything about what you're telling me.
[01:26:58.271 --> 01:27:04.394]  Now, I mean, I know that some Rhodes Scholars, they do recruit into the Inner Sanctum, but have they never tried to recruit you?
[01:27:04.534 --> 01:27:04.795]  No.
[01:27:05.395 --> 01:27:06.676]  They didn't want me, apparently.
[01:27:06.736 --> 01:27:07.496]  No, no one ever tried.
[01:27:07.516 --> 01:27:08.957]  I don't know what the Inner Sanctum is, Alex.
[01:27:08.997 --> 01:27:10.198]  It's news to me.
[01:27:10.238 --> 01:27:11.539]  How many Rhodes Scholars are there a year?
[01:27:11.579 --> 01:27:11.879]  I forget.
[01:27:13.018 --> 01:27:17.521]  I think 32 from the United States and others from around the world.
[01:27:18.101 --> 01:27:20.502]  Yeah, well you know Rhodesia and the diamond mines and the rest of it.
[01:27:20.543 --> 01:27:25.245]  Yeah, Rhodes wrote books about how he wanted to set up a global Anglo-American empire.
[01:27:25.786 --> 01:27:32.409]  And I think you're going to find at the end of the day, as Professor Carol Quigley, Clinton's mentor, wrote that this is the neo-Anglo-American empire.
[01:27:32.630 --> 01:27:34.811]  Now it's being rebuffed globally right now.
[01:27:36.069 --> 01:27:40.691]  OK, you know, other people talk about this in different terms that would be more familiar to me.
[01:27:40.731 --> 01:27:45.414]  I mean, these people do talk about, of course, kind of post-colonialism, neo-colonialism.
[01:27:45.434 --> 01:27:51.977]  I'm sure when Cecil Rhodes was writing, I mean, at the height of the British colonial empire, and he was obviously a big fan of that.
[01:27:52.137 --> 01:27:58.460]  And I now understand that, you know, people love war when they do because it generates such massive profits.
[01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:01.061]  And this has been modeled by the British Empire.
[01:28:02.162 --> 01:28:08.226]  So, I think, you know, I've certainly heard about his interest in British colonialism, you know, put in different terms.
[01:28:08.647 --> 01:28:19.694]  But what he said is they had to take the whole apparatus of British colonialism and go underground with round table groups of prominent men in power sharing, ruling over each government with a shadow system.
[01:28:20.075 --> 01:28:21.075]  Now, Mel... Oh, my God.
[01:28:21.396 --> 01:28:21.736]  No, yeah.
[01:28:21.756 --> 01:28:24.498]  I'm going to send you a lot of documentation on that as well.
[01:28:24.958 --> 01:28:27.220]  It has been a great... Well, they never wanted me, apparently.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:28.921]  I was left out of the conversation.
[01:28:29.922 --> 01:28:31.863]  I don't think Hair Clinton was.
[01:28:32.123 --> 01:28:34.905]  Hey, thank you so much for spending time with us and have a great Christmas.
[01:28:35.546 --> 01:28:36.547]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:28:36.567 --> 01:28:37.267]  I appreciate it.
[01:28:37.307 --> 01:28:37.668]  Take care.
[01:28:38.008 --> 01:28:40.130]  Naomi Wolf, we'll be right back.
[01:28:44.133 --> 01:28:45.113]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.514 --> 01:28:47.135]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:29:53.798 --> 01:29:59.441]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[01:29:59.621 --> 01:30:04.704]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:30:04.804 --> 01:30:05.364]  I think so.
[01:30:26.295 --> 01:30:26.515]  I'm good.
[01:30:53.758 --> 01:30:54.159]  Attention!

[01:31:08.971 --> 01:31:09.371]  I think so.
[01:31:25.968 --> 01:31:35.433]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.

[01:32:14.577 --> 01:32:42.421]  Call him Drunken Irohane He won't answer anymore Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian Nor the marine that went to war Gather round me people There's a story I would tell About a brave young Indian You should remember well
[01:32:43.363 --> 01:32:53.231]  From the land of the Pima Indians, a proud and noble band who farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona land.
[01:32:54.932 --> 01:33:04.379]  Down the ditches a thousand years, the water through our people's crops, till the white man stole their water rights and the sparkling water stopped.
[01:33:05.718 --> 01:33:10.702]  Now, Ira's folks were hungry, and their land grew crops and weeds.
[01:33:10.842 --> 01:33:15.586]  When war came, Ira volunteered, and forgot white man's greed.
[01:33:16.087 --> 01:33:21.992]  Call him Drunken Ira G, he's evil actor anymore.
[01:33:22.632 --> 01:33:27.436]  Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian, nor the marine that went to war.
[01:33:30.583 --> 01:33:32.745]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:32.765 --> 01:33:33.966]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:33:59.642 --> 01:34:01.703]  Peter Power flees from confrontation on 7-7 terror drills.
[01:34:01.763 --> 01:34:04.284]  This goes into the government-sponsored terror file.
[01:34:04.324 --> 01:34:09.947]  Former Scotland Yard official refuses to answer questions about who the exercises were conducted for.
[01:34:09.967 --> 01:34:10.607]  We are Change UK.
[01:34:29.688 --> 01:34:30.609]  Did the confrontation.
[01:34:30.649 --> 01:34:36.653]  We'll be talking to Keith Byron of We Are Change UK here in just a moment and playing that audio.
[01:34:37.313 --> 01:34:39.154]  Before we do that, two thanks.
[01:34:40.775 --> 01:34:55.605]  Today, Saturday, and Sunday are the last three days to guarantee if you order endgame, loose change, final cut, police state three total enslavement, martial law, terror storm, final edition, the history of government sponsored terror,
[01:34:56.551 --> 01:34:58.395]  Daniel Estelin, which we have in stock.
[01:34:58.435 --> 01:34:59.478]  Nobody else has got it.
[01:35:00.039 --> 01:35:01.442]  Amazon says they get it next week.
[01:35:01.943 --> 01:35:05.210]  We have 400 of them.
[01:35:05.591 --> 01:35:07.154]  And they are going fast.
[01:35:08.507 --> 01:35:10.729]  But if you order it, we're taking it down the minute they sell out.
[01:35:10.749 --> 01:35:12.531]  They may not, but they did last time, boy.
[01:35:13.792 --> 01:35:14.693]  They're going fast.
[01:35:15.213 --> 01:35:24.242]  His Bilderberg book, they're all available right now at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:35:25.363 --> 01:35:29.667]  Get your phone order in, get your internet order in by Sunday at midnight.
[01:35:29.687 --> 01:35:30.648]  When it rolls over to Monday,
[01:35:31.781 --> 01:35:39.754]  We'll try to ship out, you know, the orders that come in until the morning time, but everything that comes in from Sunday is being shipped Monday out this door UPS.
[01:35:39.794 --> 01:35:40.515]  And so you want it?
[01:35:40.775 --> 01:35:41.817]  You'll get it in time for Christmas.
[01:35:41.837 --> 01:35:42.518]  It's UPS.
[01:35:42.538 --> 01:35:43.520]  If you order USPS.
[01:35:44.258 --> 01:35:44.678]  Yes, we are.
[01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:04.692]  That need to be woken up.
[01:36:04.992 --> 01:36:13.660]  You can talk to your blue-in-the-face with some people, and it won't wake them up, but a DVD, a well-produced film, with documentation, with the enemy in their own words, will do it.
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:14.801]  So InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:14.841 --> 01:36:15.281]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:36:15.301 --> 01:36:17.023]  Also, preparedness is key right now.
[01:36:17.363 --> 01:36:17.903]  It's integral.
[01:36:30.495 --> 01:36:40.719]  With all the troubling signs of the economy, the war front, with food prices exploding, with all the GMO contamination, we have high-quality food.
[01:36:40.859 --> 01:36:42.820]  None of it's GMO, none of it's been altered.
[01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:45.081]  It's clean, good, uncontaminated.
[01:36:45.101 --> 01:36:47.983]  It is freeze-dried, so it stores very small.
[01:36:48.623 --> 01:36:51.044]  I mean, just masses of food in one little box.
[01:36:51.564 --> 01:36:54.725]  And you can fill a closet up with a couple of years' supply for your family.
[01:36:55.686 --> 01:36:56.946]  And then they last 10 years.
[01:36:59.477 --> 01:37:02.118]  We're more in climate control, but ten years even in a garage.
[01:37:03.019 --> 01:37:05.980]  And you can always eat this insurance policy.
[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:11.683]  This is insurance you can and will use even if these bad things that could happen don't happen.
[01:37:11.723 --> 01:37:12.303]  We hope they don't.
[01:37:12.923 --> 01:37:14.744]  So be sure and give eFoodsDirect a call.
[01:37:14.764 --> 01:37:15.065]  1-800-409-5633.

[01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:42.023]  Okay, Keith Byron of We Are Change UK.
[01:37:42.863 --> 01:37:46.685]  It is just wonderful to be able to speak with you.
[01:37:47.305 --> 01:37:48.906]  Of course, just a few
[01:37:50.103 --> 01:38:03.287]  Weeks ago, you guys went out and confronted another individual there at the London School of Economics, so you are just doing more and more in this fight.
[01:38:03.547 --> 01:38:04.307]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:38:05.047 --> 01:38:09.068]  Hey Alex, this is, I think it's slight confusion, this is We Are Change Ireland.
[01:38:10.448 --> 01:38:16.290]  Yeah, I was telling them to get, I guess, see my printout said We Are Change
[01:38:17.552 --> 01:38:24.217]  Ireland, and I just thought that was a typo, because it was We Are Change England that confronted Peter Powers, correct?
[01:38:24.817 --> 01:38:25.658]  That's correct, yeah.
[01:38:25.698 --> 01:38:36.245]  Yeah, it's a guess-nafu here, and we will deal with that, but I'm going to recap and cover this story right now.
[01:38:36.646 --> 01:38:45.932]  See, I checked and was told that was just a typo, but you guys confronted Bill Clinton, and you've been confronting others, and I meant to get you guys on a few weeks ago.
[01:38:45.952 --> 01:38:47.053]  Why don't you tell folks about that?
[01:38:50.199 --> 01:38:52.240]  We're sick and tired of what's going on in Ireland.
[01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:56.883]  We're the only country that can actually save the European sovereignty.
[01:38:57.423 --> 01:39:06.828]  We have a constitution that we have to defeat so basically we're just trying to inspire people at the moment to come join us, make their own groups, come out and stop the New World Order from putting the EU together.
[01:39:07.589 --> 01:39:15.033]  We have a constitutional referendum coming up here in May or June and we're doing our very best to defeat that.
[01:39:15.933 --> 01:39:21.475]  We've confronted Bill Clinton and also we've confronted the head of the political wing... I thought this was a mistake?
[01:39:23.456 --> 01:39:25.837]  I'm sorry, I had my mic up while I was telling the producer.
[01:39:25.997 --> 01:39:28.218]  Go ahead.
[01:39:28.378 --> 01:39:44.544]  And we confronted the head of the political wing of the IRA, Gerry Adams, and his party is Sinn Féin, and we were asking about British Intel infiltrating the party and basically was his number two British agent, which Martin Ingram alleged to.
[01:39:46.872 --> 01:39:47.852]  Please continue, sir.
[01:39:48.853 --> 01:39:50.293]  So that's what we're doing at the moment.
[01:39:50.333 --> 01:39:51.733]  We have a lot of trouble in Ireland.
[01:39:51.933 --> 01:39:58.675]  We've basically claimed over a tyranny with Britain back in the early 1920s.
[01:39:59.335 --> 01:40:00.676]  We still haven't got freedom.
[01:40:00.716 --> 01:40:06.097]  Now we're coming into more tyranny with an EU constitution that doesn't even have habeas corpus, Alex.
[01:40:08.418 --> 01:40:16.020]  Well, you know, it's great to have you on because, and I was also going to ask the We Are Change UK guys, but we got cross wires here about this.
[01:40:16.758 --> 01:40:20.643]  They denied there was going to be a European Union for 30 years as they were setting it up.
[01:40:20.703 --> 01:40:22.145]  Now everybody knows there is one.
[01:40:22.426 --> 01:40:23.807]  Some deny that even exists.
[01:40:24.148 --> 01:40:25.449]  I'm not joking when I say that.
[01:40:26.050 --> 01:40:30.977]  Then for eight years they tried to force England and Ireland into it, though they've been resistant.
[01:40:31.798 --> 01:40:32.939]  So really the entire UK.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.461]  And now they go sign the Constitution.
[01:40:36.521 --> 01:40:38.022]  Gordon Brown won't do it in public.
[01:40:38.362 --> 01:40:47.447]  They say it's about a rights treaty, but when you read it, it puts the countries under the EU government's control, not their original nation's control.
[01:40:47.927 --> 01:40:54.590]  So as someone in Ireland, as someone in the Enchanted Isles, why don't you explain to people exactly what's happening here?
[01:40:55.450 --> 01:41:02.994]  Well, what's happening is we are facing European police, European army, an EU constitution, and a federal government in Brussels.
[01:41:03.504 --> 01:41:04.645]  And this is what we're going through.
[01:41:04.685 --> 01:41:06.766]  We're doing our best to fight against this.
[01:41:07.307 --> 01:41:09.428]  We have more cameras blown up in Dublin.
[01:41:09.648 --> 01:41:11.129]  We have unlimited immigration.
[01:41:11.209 --> 01:41:12.210]  We have no borders.
[01:41:12.230 --> 01:41:13.351]  We have no currency.
[01:41:13.551 --> 01:41:14.872]  We have no national sovereignty.
[01:41:15.692 --> 01:41:18.594]  We've been resisting the tyranny for over 800 years.
[01:41:19.195 --> 01:41:20.636]  And now we're coming into more tyranny.
[01:41:20.896 --> 01:41:23.958]  We're coming into a constitution that people don't even understand.
[01:41:24.574 --> 01:41:26.674]  You know, majority of Irish people won't even listen.
[01:41:26.954 --> 01:41:36.716]  And we are the only country, Alex, to stop this treaty, because we're the only country in Europe who has a referendum to actually stop this treaty from progressing any further.
[01:41:37.536 --> 01:41:49.158]  And what we're trying to do right now, tomorrow we have a street action in Dublin, we're meeting at the GPO in a concierge at 1pm, and we're going to go out and we're going to hand out flyers and we're going to try to educate people and tell them about their rights.
[01:41:49.338 --> 01:41:52.659]  Because people in Ireland do not even understand that they have constitutional rights.
[01:41:53.260 --> 01:42:00.246]  And they think that people, the foreign people in Brussels, they think that Bert, you're hearing the Irish Prime Minister, they think that these people can call the shots.
[01:42:00.426 --> 01:42:00.867]  And they can't.
[01:42:00.887 --> 01:42:03.289]  Because we the people, we own this country.
[01:42:03.789 --> 01:42:06.052]  And same way the Americans, you own America.
[01:42:06.172 --> 01:42:08.654]  Not George Bush, not the New World Order.
[01:42:10.897 --> 01:42:11.617]  Absolutely.
[01:42:11.757 --> 01:42:16.758]  Well, this is a pleasant problem to have, to have so many We Are Change groups in the UK.
[01:42:16.778 --> 01:42:23.260]  You guys are out confronting Clinton and many others, and then we get our wires crossed getting We Are Change UK on.
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:34.142]  What did you think of their confrontation with Peter Power, the author of the 7-7 Drills, matching the exact targets at the exact times, at the exact locations that were hit?
[01:42:35.942 --> 01:42:39.103]  Hi Alex, I'm Dave.
[01:42:39.696 --> 01:43:08.449]  I thought it was very good, I think they're doing a lot of great action over in the UK and I was looking at the video there of his confrontation and he really didn't want to talk about it and he looked very very uncomfortable as if these people are not used to being questioned at this level and it's a whole new ball game for them because they're starting to realise now that they can't just go out in public and say what they want and just go along and people say what they want and nobody questions them
[01:43:09.002 --> 01:43:11.045]  And the media doesn't pick up on the lies?
[01:43:27.351 --> 01:43:31.616]  Everywhere, you know, the head of MI5, the head of MI6 goes out to events to propagandize.
[01:43:31.656 --> 01:43:33.698]  They get confronted with information.
[01:43:34.179 --> 01:43:35.901]  Senator Graham goes out, he gets confronted.
[01:43:35.941 --> 01:43:37.422]  Giuliani goes out, he gets confronted.
[01:43:37.743 --> 01:43:39.224]  Clinton goes out, he gets confronted.
[01:43:39.605 --> 01:43:42.388]  I mean, everywhere, the people are now taking action.
[01:43:43.101 --> 01:43:54.127]  And now they're talking about in our country, what they've done in your nation, criminalizing dissent, trying to tie us in with terrorists, saying we should have our freedom of speech restricted, checkpoints controlled.
[01:43:54.488 --> 01:43:58.570]  You've lived under the checkpoints of a military occupation in the name of fighting terror.
[01:43:58.610 --> 01:44:06.775]  It's now come out that 90 plus percent of the terror in Ireland was staged by the British, and to be blamed on different groups to keep the military force there.
[01:44:07.075 --> 01:44:08.256]  Can you guys comment on that?
[01:44:09.736 --> 01:44:10.057]  Yeah.
[01:44:11.417 --> 01:44:16.559]  Well, basically, you know, we have a lot of questions about Northern Ireland and it's a very sensitive subject here in the South.
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:19.961]  But we live, Alex, this is how small our country is.
[01:44:20.361 --> 01:44:23.762]  I live one hour from the North, the border in the North of Ireland.
[01:44:24.223 --> 01:44:30.826]  And the other day we confronted Gerry Adams and he is the head of Sinn Féin, which is the political wing of the IRA.
[01:44:31.346 --> 01:44:35.167]  And we asked him about British intelligence infiltrating Sinn Féin.
[01:44:35.628 --> 01:44:39.990]  And we asked about Martin McGuinness, his number two, the head of state in the North of Ireland.
[01:44:40.010 --> 01:44:40.790]  He's sharing power
[01:44:41.263 --> 01:44:42.084]  With Ian Paisley.
[01:44:42.304 --> 01:44:44.446]  We asked him, was he a British Asian?
[01:44:44.466 --> 01:44:45.787]  Which Martin Ingram alleged to.
[01:44:46.147 --> 01:44:50.050]  Now, if you go back last year, we had Dennis Donaldson.
[01:44:50.451 --> 01:44:52.152]  He was the number 3 in champagne.
[01:44:52.452 --> 01:44:54.334]  And he turned out to be a British Asian.
[01:44:54.734 --> 01:45:00.499]  And months after he actually stated that he was a British Asian, he was assassinated.
[01:45:00.539 --> 01:45:03.842]  He was murdered in Donegal just across the border in the Republic.
[01:45:06.286 --> 01:45:18.536]  Well, I've had former commandos, MI5, MI6 on, it's been in the British and of course Irish news, that at the highest levels of the armed IRA, that it would literally be all British intelligence.
[01:45:18.576 --> 01:45:25.162]  They were literally commanding the underlings, and when underlings wouldn't carry out shootings or bombings, they would kill them or break their legs.
[01:45:26.168 --> 01:45:28.049]  Again, as a way to keep things militarized.
[01:45:28.349 --> 01:45:31.050]  Because the Irish could just peacefully say, we don't want you here.
[01:45:31.710 --> 01:45:33.731]  The British government would be forced to leave.
[01:45:34.011 --> 01:45:35.211]  The British people don't want to be there.
[01:45:36.111 --> 01:45:37.392]  And they would be forced to leave.
[01:45:38.152 --> 01:45:43.634]  But if they can militarize it, and make it violent, they can then use an excuse to bring in force.
[01:45:44.494 --> 01:45:45.115]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:45.475 --> 01:45:51.517]  And as you were saying earlier as well, Alex, next year now is going to be very, very important for this country.
[01:45:51.937 --> 01:45:55.418]  Because we are the only country that can stop this EU treaty.
[01:45:56.058 --> 01:45:56.999]  From going ahead.
[01:45:57.059 --> 01:46:02.042]  Out of 27 countries, not one of them, except this country, will give the people a referendum.
[01:46:02.382 --> 01:46:03.543]  Now, here's another example.
[01:46:03.603 --> 01:46:08.946]  We're being put into the North American Union, and they're telling the public it doesn't exist when we have their own public documents.
[01:46:09.306 --> 01:46:25.096]  They're saying NAFTA highways don't exist when it's their official maps, and it's the same strategy of stealth, where they keep saying, this isn't a treaty to take over Ireland and England, but no one's allowed to vote on it, only the bureaucracy is ordering you to go under our new controls.
[01:46:26.110 --> 01:46:30.193]  Meanwhile, you see UU Expansion forcibly right now.
[01:46:30.273 --> 01:46:34.135]  I mean, this is the exact same thing that's happening here is happening with you.
[01:46:34.155 --> 01:46:37.497]  Yeah, Alex, this is Anthony.
[01:46:40.123 --> 01:46:52.089]  What's happening is we set up a website, wiseupjournal.com, and we have a link there where people like the British people, Italians and French, they're not allowed to have a say on this treaty that's going to be put through.
[01:46:52.509 --> 01:46:57.531]  We have a donation link there where they can actually help us defeat this.
[01:46:57.771 --> 01:47:08.196]  So they can actually have a say in this, and I'm sure the heads of the EU never counted on this, that people can donate to us, and Ireland, it's only three and a half million to four million people.
[01:47:08.886 --> 01:47:10.929]  This is such a small country, we can stop it.
[01:47:11.209 --> 01:47:12.211]  Bring the whole thing down.
[01:47:12.291 --> 01:47:15.915]  What are the polls showing right now on Ireland's entry into the EU?
[01:47:16.777 --> 01:47:19.200]  Well, they're showing that 25% are for this treaty and around 18% are against it.
[01:47:25.217 --> 01:47:27.539]  But the vast majority of people don't know what's going on.
[01:47:27.579 --> 01:47:28.119]  That's the problem.
[01:47:55.290 --> 01:47:56.711]  People don't know what's going on.
[01:47:56.731 --> 01:47:58.272]  It's all bureaucracy.
[01:47:58.653 --> 01:48:01.335]  It's a whole big maze of bureaucracy and laws.
[01:48:03.697 --> 01:48:07.219]  Most people just don't have the time to look at it and see what's going on.
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:08.961]  So it's all people like myself.
[01:48:09.821 --> 01:48:13.704]  Well, I want to commend We Are Change Ireland and We Are Change UK.
[01:48:14.465 --> 01:48:15.906]  You guys fire out your websites.
[01:48:16.727 --> 01:48:18.428]  Yeah, we have two websites.
[01:48:18.568 --> 01:48:24.553]  It's wacireland.org and the other one is wiseupjournal.com.
[01:48:25.609 --> 01:48:27.831]  Again, give that out again because your phone's a little bit echoey.
[01:48:28.431 --> 01:48:29.212]  Sorry about that.
[01:48:29.412 --> 01:48:31.593]  It's W-A-C Ireland dot org.
[01:48:32.074 --> 01:48:33.515]  We are changed to W-A-C.
[01:48:34.375 --> 01:48:36.297]  And it's WiseUpJournal dot com.
[01:48:36.557 --> 01:48:38.838]  WiseUpJournal dot com.
[01:48:38.898 --> 01:48:40.419]  Gentlemen, good job.
[01:48:40.439 --> 01:48:47.564]  Now, of course, what did the former head of Champagne say when you confronted him about intelligence infiltration?
[01:48:48.185 --> 01:48:50.406]  Well, I went up myself, Alex.
[01:48:50.747 --> 01:48:54.029]  I'm the actual person that questioned him about it.
[01:48:56.230 --> 01:49:05.534]  Basically, he's a well-liked man, he's very articulate, but we went up and we asked him, is British intelligence, are they infiltrating Sinn Féin, or have they?
[01:49:06.475 --> 01:49:08.216]  He said, yes, I'm sure that they have.
[01:49:08.916 --> 01:49:09.777]  And I was like, really?
[01:49:10.697 --> 01:49:21.483]  But he already stated this before, but the most important question that I wanted to ask was Martin Ingram's allegation saying that Martin McGuinness, his number two, was a British agent.
[01:49:21.823 --> 01:49:23.524]  So the minute I said that, I said,
[01:49:24.577 --> 01:49:32.582]  What about Martin England's allegation saying that Martin McGuinness was a British agent?
[01:49:33.103 --> 01:49:43.169]  And all of a sudden he became very uncomfortable, he started backing off and one of his guys to the side of him was kind of trying to, he was like pushing me away from him and, you know, trying to force me out of place.
[01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:52.075]  So I became very uncomfortable at that stage, but what we did was... Stay there, I want to hear the end of this, what happened with We Are Change Ireland, stay with us.
[01:49:54.597 --> 01:49:55.997]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:56.017 --> 01:49:58.138]  A new world order.
[01:49:58.858 --> 01:50:03.079]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:50:03.739 --> 01:50:05.499]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:50:06.559 --> 01:50:08.820]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:11.800]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:19.842]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:22.873 --> 01:50:27.876]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:28.337 --> 01:50:31.819]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:32.199 --> 01:50:34.701]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:50:34.761 --> 01:50:35.922]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.942 --> 01:50:36.682]  They're not after money.
[01:50:36.702 --> 01:50:37.783]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:37.983 --> 01:50:38.744]  They're after power.
[01:50:38.984 --> 01:50:40.004]  That's what I have to do.
[01:50:40.125 --> 01:50:44.668]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:50:44.868 --> 01:50:48.330]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:51.712]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:50:51.732 --> 01:50:52.693]  You have been warned.
[01:50:53.514 --> 01:50:58.597]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:58.657 --> 01:51:05.962]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:06.122 --> 01:51:16.770]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:21.473]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:21.773 --> 01:51:26.757]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:51:26.977 --> 01:51:29.899]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:30.139 --> 01:51:39.886]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than 2 cents per gallon.
[01:51:39.906 --> 01:51:40.947]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188.
[01:51:43.749 --> 01:51:44.310]  We're good to go.
[01:51:53.288 --> 01:51:56.750]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:51:56.970 --> 01:51:59.092]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:51:59.232 --> 01:52:01.693]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:52:01.953 --> 01:52:06.316]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[01:52:06.356 --> 01:52:07.037]  Here's why.
[01:52:07.437 --> 01:52:13.380]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:52:13.621 --> 01:52:19.624]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[01:52:19.844 --> 01:52:20.765]  But they're not cheating.
[01:52:20.985 --> 01:52:25.008]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:52:25.188 --> 01:52:29.532]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:52:29.632 --> 01:52:37.137]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:52:37.178 --> 01:52:37.778]  Get control.
[01:52:38.018 --> 01:52:38.579]  Get relief.
[01:52:38.639 --> 01:52:39.339]  Get some sleep.
[01:52:39.459 --> 01:52:42.642]  Go to www.outin90.com.
[01:52:42.782 --> 01:52:46.164]  That's www.outin90.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:46.184 --> 01:52:46.425]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:50.848 --> 01:52:51.588]  Oh, Jimmy Vaughn!
[01:53:19.051 --> 01:53:20.253]  He is such a nice guy.
[01:53:21.875 --> 01:53:22.516]  Smart, too.
[01:53:22.716 --> 01:53:24.999]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:25.239 --> 01:53:28.763]  We're talking to We Are Change Ireland, and I found out the staff who have it.
[01:53:28.804 --> 01:53:29.805]  They were scheduled for Monday.
[01:53:36.147 --> 01:53:40.571]  And then somehow I should get We Are Change UK on, and that turned into the boys coming on today.
[01:53:40.591 --> 01:53:42.392]  I don't want to shortchange you guys.
[01:53:42.412 --> 01:53:46.836]  I've got to sit you up for a full 30 minutes or hour sometime in the future, because you're really getting prolific.
[01:53:47.116 --> 01:53:48.277]  I've got to move fast here.
[01:53:48.337 --> 01:53:58.726]  Gentlemen, Keith and others, just finish up real fast with what the head of Champaign, the political arm of the IRA, and it's admitted that we're the Chantelle all the way.
[01:53:58.746 --> 01:54:03.350]  So as soon as you brought this up, the nice man face went away.
[01:54:04.167 --> 01:54:08.851]  Yeah, well, he kind of stood back and he just said, no, no way.
[01:54:09.192 --> 01:54:11.914]  But you could kind of see that he didn't like what I was saying.
[01:54:11.974 --> 01:54:13.175]  He was very uncomfortable.
[01:54:13.595 --> 01:54:20.682]  And the minute I mentioned British intelligence, the guy right next to me, you can't actually see on the footage, but he became very uncomfortable too.
[01:54:21.022 --> 01:54:27.708]  So you can see that the credibility of the party and especially Gerry Adams, it's gone to the gutter really.
[01:54:29.252 --> 01:54:38.434]  You know, we all know that British intelligence have infiltrated the Sinn Féin and the IRA, and really, it's just about the people copping onto it at this stage.
[01:54:38.894 --> 01:54:39.455]  Absolutely.
[01:54:39.475 --> 01:54:52.098]  Well, gentlemen, continue your fight against the European Union, and get a bunch of your notes together, because I'll probably want to have you on again next week if you can do it, to specifically flesh all this out, because it mirrors the same stratagem of stealth they're using here.
[01:54:52.158 --> 01:54:52.598]  God bless.
[01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:54.151]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:54:54.331 --> 01:54:54.631]  You bet.
[01:54:54.671 --> 01:54:58.634]  Now I want to shift gears back into originally why we wanted We Are Change UK on.
[01:54:59.514 --> 01:55:02.877]  And that's Peter Powers-Flees from Confrontation on 7-7 Terror Drill.
[01:55:03.377 --> 01:55:12.784]  First, in this few-minute clip, three-minute clip, you hear him from BBC Radio talking about running drills at the exact same locations.
[01:55:13.144 --> 01:55:20.410]  Then it cuts to him two nights ago being confronted by We Are Change UK, and he literally ran and hid in a closet, and then they made them leave.
[01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:20.750]  Here it is.
[01:55:22.236 --> 01:55:32.322]  Because at half-past nine this morning, we were actually running an exercise for over a company of a thousand people in London, based on simultaneous bombs going off precisely at the railway stations that happened this morning.
[01:55:32.722 --> 01:55:35.043]  So I still have the hairs on the back of my neck standing upright.
[01:55:35.224 --> 01:55:36.104]  So you kept this quite straight.
[01:55:36.124 --> 01:55:41.627]  You were running an exercise to see how you would cope with this, and it happened while you were running the exercise?
[01:55:41.907 --> 01:55:42.408]  Precisely.
[01:55:42.588 --> 01:55:44.509]  And it was about half-past nine this morning.
[01:55:44.549 --> 01:55:48.091]  We planned this for a company, and for obvious reasons, I don't want to reveal their name, but if they're listening, they'll know it.
[01:55:49.327 --> 01:55:58.671]  The only thing I have, we're a little bit... We're funded by the Arts Council.
[01:55:59.011 --> 01:56:00.412]  It's a very low budget.
[01:56:00.732 --> 01:56:02.133]  We don't get paid for this at all.
[01:56:02.753 --> 01:56:06.515]  We get sent out on these missions to interview celebrities.
[01:56:06.575 --> 01:56:08.876]  One thing I won't tolerate, you're filming me now aren't you?
[01:56:09.416 --> 01:56:19.582]  We'd like to know who you're running mock terror drills for on 7-7.
[01:56:19.622 --> 01:56:20.983]  Which company were you working for?
[01:56:21.043 --> 01:56:25.065]  You say there's a precise station, precise times at the precise three stations.
[01:56:25.105 --> 01:56:26.045]  Have you any comment on that?
[01:56:26.386 --> 01:56:29.407]  Why have you not been investigated or the company investigated?
[01:56:29.467 --> 01:56:31.768]  Why have you not investigated, Mr Power?
[01:56:32.309 --> 01:56:34.750]  52 people died in those bombings, Mr Power.
[01:56:34.770 --> 01:56:36.011]  52 people died in those power...
[01:56:39.414 --> 01:56:41.978]  52 people died, Mr. Power.
[01:56:42.018 --> 01:56:43.860]  How do you know which three stations?
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:45.582]  Who helped you choose those three stations?
[01:56:46.283 --> 01:56:48.045]  How many people knew before the event?
[01:56:48.105 --> 01:56:49.567]  How many people knew, Mr. Power?
[01:56:50.007 --> 01:56:51.449]  Oh, sorry, I've got to go in here now.
[01:56:52.591 --> 01:56:56.555]  With the tube lines, how many of the clients knew that those were simulated targets?
[01:56:59.310 --> 01:57:02.592]  Absolutely fabulous job by We Are Change UK.
[01:57:02.712 --> 01:57:05.534]  Their story up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:57:05.574 --> 01:57:11.637]  A lot of people don't even know about the drills the government was running with Mr. Power and his company that day.
[01:57:12.617 --> 01:57:14.278]  We're the one in Underground, we know that.
[01:57:14.979 --> 01:57:16.380]  But it's good to confront him on it.
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:20.622]  He literally ran like a vampire would run from a gigantic crucifix.
[01:57:21.716 --> 01:57:22.016]  What?
[01:57:22.036 --> 01:57:22.397]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.324 --> 01:57:52.425]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.105 --> 01:57:54.206]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.847 --> 01:57:55.667]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.428 --> 01:57:57.308]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.328 --> 01:58:01.671]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.192 --> 01:58:06.255]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.566 --> 01:58:12.227]  We're back live ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:12.287 --> 01:58:20.529]  Already into the third and final hour of this Friday the 14th of December 2007 transmission against tyranny.
[01:58:20.549 --> 01:58:24.911]  Daniel Estelin is a resident of Spain, originally from Canada.
[01:58:25.271 --> 01:58:31.813]  He's been covering Club Bilderberg for I guess about 16 years now and been to more than 10 of their conferences.
[01:58:33.146 --> 01:58:35.708]  And of course, I joined him in Ottawa last year.
[01:58:35.788 --> 01:58:39.350]  He is a big part of Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:58:40.011 --> 01:58:55.821]  His new book, The Bilderberg Group, is a best-seller all over the world, and it finally got published in the U.S., and his first printing was snapped up instantaneously, I'm told, the second printing, from the verge of selling out.
[01:58:56.798 --> 01:59:01.560]  We've got 400 of these books, ladies and gentlemen, that aren't available anywhere else right now.
[01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:04.720]  I'm told the publisher just now got some, so that may be changing.
[01:59:05.221 --> 01:59:07.221]  I hope you'll get them at Infowars.com.
[01:59:07.241 --> 01:59:15.424]  But before we get into Bilderberg and the whole globalist agenda, I wanted to talk to Daniel about EU's expansion treaty, not letting the member states vote on it, other than Ireland.
[01:59:15.984 --> 01:59:18.645]  I've heard the frightening numbers that the majority there are for it.
[01:59:19.205 --> 01:59:20.705]  It's different in France and everywhere else.
[01:59:20.725 --> 01:59:21.406]  They're all against it.
[01:59:21.546 --> 01:59:22.906]  England's 80-plus percent against.
[01:59:23.713 --> 01:59:31.342]  And how they're doing this by stealth, the same thing with the NAU integration and how they're being very deceptive along those lines.
[01:59:31.702 --> 01:59:33.284]  Daniel, it's great to have you on, my friend.
[01:59:34.025 --> 01:59:36.107]  Alex, it's so wonderful to be back on your show.
[01:59:36.127 --> 01:59:39.451]  Good afternoon to all your listeners in the United States and across the world.
[01:59:39.951 --> 01:59:43.916]  I want to say congratulations on your book selling out.
[01:59:45.211 --> 01:59:46.712]  Well, Alex, isn't it amazing?
[01:59:46.752 --> 02:00:09.783]  The book has been published now in 49 countries and translated into 29 languages, and in the United States, a man who publishes my book is a mini-tiny publisher by the name of Trine Day, and instead of being snapped up by one of the biggest behemoths such as Simon Schuster and company, who won't, of course, come anywhere near this book, we have to go to Trine Day and Chris Milligan
[02:00:10.223 --> 02:00:10.584]  I think so.
[02:00:30.112 --> 02:00:33.197]  Absolutely, but the truth is exploding.
[02:00:33.217 --> 02:00:36.683]  Ron Paul revolution, all of it has definitely got them worried.
[02:00:36.964 --> 02:00:38.947]  What do you think the establishment is going to do?
[02:00:38.967 --> 02:00:42.573]  Are they going to try to pull a rabbit out of a hat to try to neutralize the revolution?
[02:00:43.728 --> 02:00:44.889]  Well, it depends.
[02:00:45.009 --> 02:00:46.531]  In my case, I think it's too late.
[02:00:46.571 --> 02:00:47.531]  They miscalculated.
[02:00:47.551 --> 02:00:51.775]  The idea was, you know, to have me, to stop me before I got to the States.
[02:00:52.175 --> 02:00:53.236]  They weren't able to do that.
[02:00:53.296 --> 02:01:01.682]  Now that the book is all over the world, it makes no sense for them to make any noise, so they'll just try to ignore it, which is what is exactly what they're doing right now.
[02:01:02.243 --> 02:01:13.031]  I think with Ron Paul, there's a bigger danger that, you know, I'm getting information from my sources that there are people involved on higher levels of the American establishment
[02:01:13.451 --> 02:01:15.292]  We're seriously considering it again.
[02:01:15.612 --> 02:01:19.955]  This has not been confirmed, but assassination is definitely on the agenda.
[02:01:20.295 --> 02:01:22.877]  And I do, God, I pray to God this is not the case.
[02:01:23.337 --> 02:01:28.120]  And needless to say, we need wrong parts of this world to go out there and help us win this fight.
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:41.748]  But again, the people who, for over a decade, have provided some invaluable information to me on some of the more important subjects, which of course have come true, now are telling me that there is some talk
[02:01:45.310 --> 02:01:50.775]  Daniel, that's really scary.
[02:01:50.795 --> 02:01:52.036]  You don't make things up.
[02:01:52.056 --> 02:01:55.018]  You're a stickler on your sources and your documentation.
[02:01:55.038 --> 02:01:57.820]  You're saying that, are these impeccable sources?
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:00.122]  And they're telling you that that's being flooded about?
[02:02:00.962 --> 02:02:01.763]  Well, it is.
[02:02:01.843 --> 02:02:05.907]  There's been a trial balloon within, you know, within the inner core of the inner core.
[02:02:06.287 --> 02:02:07.768]  It hasn't gotten beyond that.
[02:02:07.828 --> 02:02:13.413]  But at least, obviously, it's on the table, because I think, needless to say, they're very much concerned.
[02:02:13.433 --> 02:02:22.401]  And now we know what the American political history is like over the last 40 years, and how easy it is to make things look and appear what they're not.
[02:02:22.882 --> 02:02:26.325]  And needless to say, again, Alex, I pray to God that this is not the case.
[02:02:26.918 --> 02:02:31.599]  That Rob Paul can actually get out there and actually get his message out to the people.
[02:02:32.059 --> 02:02:35.099]  Something he's doing so well with your help among so many other people.
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:37.260]  Let's flesh this out more on the other side.
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:39.900]  Talk about the European Expansion Treaty.
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:42.721]  Get into the North American Union and the Bilderberg Agenda for 2008.
[02:02:43.061 --> 02:02:45.281]  Stay with us.
[02:02:46.281 --> 02:02:47.682]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:47.702 --> 02:02:49.802]  A new world order.
[02:02:50.522 --> 02:02:54.143]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by power.
[02:02:55.413 --> 02:02:57.154]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[02:02:58.235 --> 02:03:00.457]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:03:01.017 --> 02:03:03.479]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:11.566]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:14.542 --> 02:03:19.545]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:20.006 --> 02:03:23.488]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:23.868 --> 02:03:26.370]  Bill of Rights is making great progress for the world government.
[02:03:26.430 --> 02:03:27.411]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:27.431 --> 02:03:28.331]  They're not after money.
[02:03:28.371 --> 02:03:29.452]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:29.652 --> 02:03:30.373]  They're after power.
[02:03:30.393 --> 02:03:31.493]  That's what they're after, isn't it?

[02:04:44.949 --> 02:04:46.431]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.

[02:05:01.227 --> 02:05:04.831]  The package contains 6 DVDs that contain 10 different programs.
[02:05:05.151 --> 02:05:08.752]  Two books that combined are over a thousand pages and other information.

[02:05:46.585 --> 02:05:48.786]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.366 --> 02:05:52.207]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.748 --> 02:05:57.109]  My producer set Daniel up from Spain two days ago.
[02:05:57.129 --> 02:06:01.150]  I have not talked to Daniel in his very busy schedule, my busy schedule.
[02:06:02.050 --> 02:06:03.991]  You're learning about this as I learn about it.
[02:06:04.031 --> 02:06:06.432]  I just mentioned, hey, what do you think of Ron Paul?
[02:06:07.738 --> 02:06:09.759]  And Daniel does not make things up.
[02:06:09.799 --> 02:06:11.180]  Daniel does not exaggerate.
[02:06:11.601 --> 02:06:16.483]  Daniel is very conservative, more conservative than I am in his approach.
[02:06:18.205 --> 02:06:19.545]  He has intelligent sources.
[02:06:19.585 --> 02:06:20.626]  He has government sources.
[02:06:20.666 --> 02:06:28.431]  He's continued to break news weeks, months, and years before it comes out from sources in Bilderberg, just as Jim Tucker has done.
[02:06:28.511 --> 02:06:29.932]  He is the second longest
[02:06:31.753 --> 02:06:34.754]  You know, researcher for now 16 years on this, Tucker 30.
[02:06:35.755 --> 02:06:40.956]  He is the preeminent now, because obviously Tucker's older and doesn't, isn't able to work as hard on this.
[02:06:41.296 --> 02:06:57.442]  He is the preeminent researcher on Bilderberg and the whole interlocking NATO, British Roundtable groups, the Black Nobility, and that, you know, that ties into the whole global system, the UN, the Vatican, the British government, all of it.
[02:06:58.102 --> 02:07:03.988]  And for him to come on air and say this, now during the break I asked him to flesh it out, how much he could talk about.
[02:07:04.288 --> 02:07:10.995]  Daniel, go as far as you can, give us as much as you can about this situation with the Congressman.
[02:07:11.873 --> 02:07:12.133]  Right.
[02:07:13.313 --> 02:07:20.935]  Before we get into this Alex, I just want to remind the audience who might not know or might not be aware of the things that I've been reviewing and predicting over the years.
[02:07:21.335 --> 02:07:27.577]  In September, shortly after the Bill O'Reilly conference, I said that the war in Iran was off the table.
[02:07:27.637 --> 02:07:28.977]  Actually, I said it in July.
[02:07:29.478 --> 02:07:30.578]  No, no, no.
[02:07:30.658 --> 02:07:30.958]  Stop.
[02:07:31.776 --> 02:07:35.358]  It's now in Endgame 1.5 for PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[02:07:35.919 --> 02:07:40.602]  I've got you on video in an interview with you and Tucker together, where you're saying... That was a year ago!
[02:07:40.782 --> 02:07:42.003]  Well, that was a year and a half ago.
[02:07:42.043 --> 02:07:43.223]  That would be... Oh, you're right.
[02:07:43.544 --> 02:07:44.144]  Okay, you're right.
[02:07:44.204 --> 02:07:44.904]  I'm sorry, you're right.
[02:07:44.964 --> 02:07:45.985]  It's a year and a half ago.
[02:07:46.005 --> 02:07:47.726]  I said the war in Iran was off the table.
[02:07:48.006 --> 02:07:48.747]  I thought it was recently.
[02:07:48.787 --> 02:07:49.828]  Time flies, really does.
[02:07:50.308 --> 02:07:59.734]  Anyway, a year and a half ago, I said the Iran war was off the table, and absolutely everybody, until a couple of weeks ago, was saying, we're going to have an Iran war, we're going to have a third world war.
[02:08:00.194 --> 02:08:03.776]  And I said, and you're right, it's an endgame.
[02:08:04.076 --> 02:08:05.097]  There's going to be no war.
[02:08:05.197 --> 02:08:09.280]  And now the intelligence community comes out and says, no, there's nothing there, nothing cooking.
[02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:12.602]  And Bush had to admit, no, actually, there won't be war.
[02:08:12.922 --> 02:08:14.683]  It's not that Bush doesn't want war.
[02:08:14.703 --> 02:08:18.005]  It's that the people in Bilderberg told the little Bush man.
[02:08:18.718 --> 02:08:19.779]  No war in Iran.
[02:08:19.859 --> 02:08:20.719]  Do you understand?
[02:08:20.739 --> 02:08:21.920]  No war.
[02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:22.941]  And he understood.
[02:08:22.961 --> 02:08:32.988]  Now, as far as Ron Paul is concerned, and again, Alex, I have to be very careful how I say this because these people's lives are in grave danger should their identity be revealed.
[02:08:33.408 --> 02:08:37.210]  These are my intelligence sources in the American intelligence community.
[02:08:37.451 --> 02:08:48.418]  What they're telling me is that the people of the highest level of government, not related in any way, at least visually, to George W. Bush, are saying, at least,
[02:08:48.978 --> 02:09:00.945]  For now, you know, the first initial conversation of what might happen if we were to do this, and this is information they're relaying to me right now.
[02:09:01.085 --> 02:09:09.509]  So they're now wargaming the possibilities, they're now judging and analyzing whether that would be good or bad.
[02:09:10.430 --> 02:09:10.730]  Exactly.
[02:09:12.856 --> 02:09:15.758]  ...does this kind of international analysis.
[02:09:15.878 --> 02:09:20.942]  You have hundreds of internal experts who war game it and brainstorm and look at different angles.
[02:09:21.483 --> 02:09:21.903]  Exactly.
[02:09:21.923 --> 02:09:24.185]  And the question always is, what would happen if?
[02:09:24.625 --> 02:09:39.317]  And this, again, this possibility of what would happen if, and again, these people, my sources, are getting it from their sources in the government, who are absolutely terrified of the possible consequences should something like this actually go down and take place.
[02:09:40.811 --> 02:09:43.534]  Because they're believing it will explode into a revolution?
[02:09:43.554 --> 02:09:51.023]  I don't think... I think one of the things that they're seeing, my sources, is that no one really knows.
[02:09:51.103 --> 02:09:54.267]  There's just so many unknown factors in this.
[02:09:54.747 --> 02:10:00.394]  You know, people have been beaten down to the point I don't think they realize any longer what goes on around them.
[02:10:00.914 --> 02:10:10.366]  But again, this is such a thing, and Ron Paul phenomena has galvanized an entire nation, just as my book and your video, Endgame, have done the same.
[02:10:10.406 --> 02:10:13.670]  A couple of weeks ago, I talked to Richard Siren in Toronto.
[02:10:13.710 --> 02:10:15.091]  He presented the Toronto
[02:10:16.713 --> 02:10:18.054]  And I'm not exaggerating in one bit.
[02:10:46.835 --> 02:10:47.636]  Well, that's amazing.
[02:10:47.676 --> 02:11:09.288]  Getting back to Ron Paul, I know you've got to be very delicate on intelligence matters, and you can't even tell me over the phone because they're obviously listening during the last break, and we obviously have a lot of allies in the system as well, let's be clear about that, and I want you to elaborate, but specifically, was it, they're just floating in the councils, and with the different analysts, what would happen if he was killed, or...
[02:11:12.641 --> 02:11:19.904]  Or was that the response to discussions of, we may kill him, what do you think will happen?
[02:11:19.944 --> 02:11:21.925]  I mean, flesh that out.
[02:11:21.945 --> 02:11:25.327]  Their discussion, what would happen if they were to remove him?
[02:11:25.387 --> 02:11:26.767]  Actually, the word is not to kill.
[02:11:27.147 --> 02:11:29.588]  The word that they're using is remove.
[02:11:29.628 --> 02:11:30.589]  That's the actual word.
[02:11:30.609 --> 02:11:35.491]  Now again, it is being done within the think tanks, and not within any think tank.
[02:11:35.891 --> 02:11:42.335]  But again, I have to be very careful, and unless I have the clear from my intelligence sources, I can't even name the think tank.
[02:11:42.716 --> 02:11:51.922]  When I can, I will let you know, and then maybe I can be back on the show, and we can talk more about this, because needless to say, Ron Paul people need to know about this.
[02:11:51.962 --> 02:11:53.163]  Okay, but let me just be clear here.
[02:11:53.823 --> 02:12:01.108]  Is there discussions within the system... I mean, this is what I'm trying to say here.
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:09.847]  Are there forces inside the government, from the intel you got, that want him dead, or who are asking, what will happen if we kill him?
[02:12:10.247 --> 02:12:11.508]  Will that backfire?
[02:12:11.869 --> 02:12:15.011]  Or, is there just people in intelligence... What would happen if we kill him?
[02:12:15.031 --> 02:12:15.772]  Would it backfire?
[02:12:15.792 --> 02:12:16.132]  That's it.
[02:12:16.833 --> 02:12:21.717]  And so there's... So people inside the system are entertaining his assassination?
[02:12:22.991 --> 02:12:25.212]  Again, I don't know how many people.
[02:12:25.232 --> 02:12:26.913]  I don't think there are that many.
[02:12:26.933 --> 02:12:30.095]  I think it's a very small circle of intimates.
[02:12:30.515 --> 02:12:33.857]  And I can't explain you more than that because I don't know it myself.
[02:12:33.897 --> 02:12:37.718]  Because again, we were not communicating over a secure line.
[02:12:38.059 --> 02:12:39.519]  So I only know what I told you.
[02:12:39.559 --> 02:12:42.741]  But again, as soon as I know more, you'll be the first to know.
[02:12:43.740 --> 02:12:44.681]  Well, let me be clear here.
[02:12:44.741 --> 02:12:47.964]  His numbers have doubled and now are on the verge of tripling in polls.
[02:12:48.104 --> 02:12:50.807]  He's winning global and national caucuses.
[02:12:51.908 --> 02:12:56.352]  He has now gone viral supernova like I've never seen before.
[02:12:56.372 --> 02:12:57.873]  It literally hit the zeitgeist.
[02:12:57.893 --> 02:12:58.614]  He's about to raise
[02:12:58.954 --> 02:13:02.557]  Between 6 and 10 million on the Money Bomb this Sunday.
[02:13:02.798 --> 02:13:10.084]  And I've seen a new strategy now where they're saying he doesn't exist, he's failing, he's nothing, or outrightly trying to ignore him now.
[02:13:10.585 --> 02:13:13.627]  And now they're trying to push Huckabee as a replacement.
[02:13:13.928 --> 02:13:16.390]  So I do see them now treating him as a real threat.
[02:13:17.727 --> 02:13:19.468]  I think he has always been a real threat.
[02:13:19.488 --> 02:13:24.170]  It was just a question for him to become that threat or to disappear, drop off the radar screen.
[02:13:24.530 --> 02:13:25.570]  And he has taken advantage.
[02:13:25.590 --> 02:13:27.171]  He has played it very, very smartly.
[02:13:27.511 --> 02:13:28.692]  And he is exactly where he is.
[02:13:28.732 --> 02:13:32.933]  And again, what you were saying just now, we can easily apply to my book as well.
[02:13:33.214 --> 02:13:34.214]  They've tried to ignore it.
[02:13:34.274 --> 02:13:34.854]  They couldn't.
[02:13:35.274 --> 02:13:41.077]  It has sold over 15 editions in Spain, over 250,000 copies of my buildable book.
[02:13:41.437 --> 02:13:42.237]  Now it's in the States.
[02:13:42.317 --> 02:13:44.118]  The first edition sold out on a snap.
[02:13:44.511 --> 02:13:47.392]  The second one is almost sold out before it hit the stores.
[02:13:47.813 --> 02:13:49.693]  The third one is going to be coming out shortly.
[02:13:49.713 --> 02:13:54.776]  And again, these people are realizing that it's the people that are leading this fight.
[02:13:55.236 --> 02:14:06.601]  And there are a lot of people out there who have not been dumbed down by the establishment and the mass media entertainment, who are willing and able to stand up and actually be counted.
[02:14:06.621 --> 02:14:08.642]  Because I think what you and I have done, Alex,
[02:14:09.222 --> 02:14:09.742]  Daniel Eskalon,
[02:14:37.689 --> 02:14:46.073]  The New World Order can deal with leaders, they can deal with big money, they can deal with large movements that have heads.
[02:14:46.573 --> 02:14:52.496]  But just from the position of putting on their hat and analyzing it the other way,
[02:14:53.451 --> 02:14:59.974]  In a counter-revolutionary position, this attack pattern that the people are leading is headless.
[02:15:00.474 --> 02:15:03.335]  It's virally exploding at an exponential rate.
[02:15:03.815 --> 02:15:06.756]  Even if the globalists stage more terror attacks, I've analyzed it.
[02:15:07.196 --> 02:15:09.937]  Every angle I look at shows that backfiring on them.
[02:15:10.197 --> 02:15:12.538]  But if they don't move, it's going to blow up in their face.
[02:15:12.758 --> 02:15:16.660]  If they don't kill Ron Paul, me, you, and make no mistake, folks, I can
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:19.722]  Literally feel the wings of death flapping around my head every day.
[02:15:19.962 --> 02:15:21.023]  They're looking at me right now.
[02:15:21.043 --> 02:15:21.884]  They're looking at Daniel.
[02:15:22.064 --> 02:15:23.085]  They're looking at the Congressman.
[02:15:23.125 --> 02:15:23.745]  He's set on air.
[02:15:23.785 --> 02:15:24.626]  He knows it's a danger.
[02:15:25.807 --> 02:15:26.908]  He's a very serious man.
[02:15:26.928 --> 02:15:35.274]  I mean, every angle I look at this, it shows like two freight trains going 100 miles an hour on the same tracks that are going to collide.
[02:15:35.314 --> 02:15:35.975]  What do you say to that?
[02:15:37.003 --> 02:15:44.025]  Well, you're absolutely right, but we have an advantage, and advantage is, is that there is no recognizable leader to this movement.
[02:15:44.385 --> 02:15:48.286]  It's people in power in the movement, which is basically what's happening around the world.
[02:15:48.666 --> 02:15:50.926]  Not only in the United States, but everywhere.
[02:15:51.287 --> 02:16:00.949]  And you see this, so they can't just kill off six billion people, although they definitely would like to do that, because again, as I said a year ago, and I say it now,
[02:16:01.522 --> 02:16:07.146]  The war is not against Osama Bin Laden or this traveling circus known as the mullahs of Iran.
[02:16:07.767 --> 02:16:16.193]  We are their enemy and they will not stop until they obliterate us, destroy us, wipe us out, and subjugate us.
[02:16:19.048 --> 02:16:26.615]  The advantage Alex that we have is that we don't have a recognizable president leading this, leading this fight, this movement for freedom.
[02:16:26.995 --> 02:16:43.791]  There are a lot of people, a lot of smaller, smallish groups around the country, around the world, who are taking matters into their own hands and doing what they can to make sure that they're not thought part of the system, which obviously has long time ago stopped working for them.
[02:16:44.804 --> 02:16:46.889]  And this is a revolution that isn't going to go away.
[02:16:47.170 --> 02:16:48.413]  It's only going to get stronger.
[02:16:49.054 --> 02:16:54.406]  Getting back to Ron Paul, Daniel Esselstyn, we're going to come back and get into the Bilderberg agenda, EU expansion.
[02:16:57.113 --> 02:17:01.897]  Fleshing this out more, and I'm just trying to analyze and guess what the intelligence people are saying.
[02:17:01.957 --> 02:17:04.640]  A lot of them, I know, like the Congressman, a lot of them are good patriots.
[02:17:04.980 --> 02:17:06.622]  Globally, they don't like what's happening.
[02:17:07.042 --> 02:17:15.690]  Are they realizing, from their own studied view, that if they do kill Paul, or if a bolt of lightning strikes him, that's going to just enrage the revolution a hundred times?
[02:17:16.821 --> 02:17:17.782]  Well, I don't know.
[02:17:17.842 --> 02:17:19.302]  I think that's just wishful thinking.
[02:17:19.342 --> 02:17:22.704]  God, I hope so, but I just, you know, if that's the case, you know, then take me!
[02:17:23.124 --> 02:17:37.390]  But unfortunately, I just don't see it this way because, again, what has unfortunately happened, especially with the television, is that the mass media has persuaded people that what they can see with their eyes is what's there to see.
[02:17:37.410 --> 02:17:38.070]  Stay there.
[02:17:38.130 --> 02:17:39.131]  Break it down when we get back.
[02:17:39.831 --> 02:17:42.152]  Daniel Esselstyn, author of The Bilderberg Group.
[02:17:43.129 --> 02:17:43.749]  Get it at InfoWars.com now!
[02:17:43.769 --> 02:17:44.410]  Ted Anders for Midas, December 14, 2007.
[02:17:44.470 --> 02:17:46.671]  Gold 790, 70 ounce gold coins can be purchased for 814.67, 401.55 for half, 278 for quarter.
[02:17:46.691 --> 02:17:46.991]  That's 814.67, 401.55, and 278.
[02:18:00.177 --> 02:18:03.460]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:07.923]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[02:18:08.243 --> 02:18:12.227]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[02:18:12.607 --> 02:18:14.428]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[02:18:14.929 --> 02:18:16.590]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[02:18:16.730 --> 02:18:17.210]  We're good.
[02:18:46.189 --> 02:18:50.450]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:18:50.710 --> 02:18:55.592]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:18:55.792 --> 02:18:57.132]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:18:57.312 --> 02:19:00.853]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[02:19:00.913 --> 02:19:06.094]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[02:19:06.334 --> 02:19:12.076]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[02:19:12.436 --> 02:19:14.818]  Now, CalBin soaps are available to you and me.
[02:19:14.939 --> 02:19:17.261]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.

[02:19:19.903 --> 02:19:20.864]  No harsh chemicals.
[02:19:21.104 --> 02:19:22.025]  No animal testing.
[02:19:22.285 --> 02:19:23.607]  I use them and love them.
[02:19:23.627 --> 02:19:25.228]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:19:25.508 --> 02:19:26.669]  And I save big time.
[02:19:26.930 --> 02:19:28.511]  Call CalBin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:19:28.651 --> 02:19:28.971]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[02:19:28.992 --> 02:19:31.514]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:40.902]  Again, that number 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:19:45.794 --> 02:19:48.816]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:19:49.136 --> 02:19:54.059]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:19:54.319 --> 02:19:58.661]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:19:58.962 --> 02:20:07.867]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:20:08.087 --> 02:20:11.709]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:20:11.989 --> 02:20:17.015]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:20:17.315 --> 02:20:24.043]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:20:24.543 --> 02:20:25.064]  What about you?
[02:20:25.817 --> 02:20:30.720]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.
[02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:31.180]  A $14 savings.

[02:20:45.658 --> 02:20:51.162]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:20:51.602 --> 02:20:55.825]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:20:56.245 --> 02:21:03.110]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:21:03.550 --> 02:21:10.255]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:21:10.575 --> 02:21:12.176]  There are no reported side effects.
[02:21:12.477 --> 02:21:15.659]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:21:15.939 --> 02:21:18.401]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[02:21:18.701 --> 02:21:25.446]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:21:25.866 --> 02:21:28.547]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:21:28.807 --> 02:21:32.188]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll free at 866-885-6625.
[02:21:32.228 --> 02:21:32.609]  That's 866-885-6625.
[02:21:32.649 --> 02:21:34.409]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[02:21:57.823 --> 02:22:01.326]  Short segment, long segment coming up with Daniel Esteland.
[02:22:01.426 --> 02:22:13.535]  Daniel, we're going to get off the Ron Paul thing here in a minute, but obviously now we've got to do an article at TruthNews.us and PrisonPlanet.com because I brought this up six months ago to the Congress, and he said, yeah, if I get big enough, if this movement gets big enough,
[02:22:14.167 --> 02:22:14.267]  Well,
[02:22:43.596 --> 02:22:48.218]  I think, Alex, more than anything else, the intelligence people are patriots.
[02:22:48.298 --> 02:22:49.198]  I know a lot of them.
[02:22:49.218 --> 02:22:50.739]  You probably know quite a few as well.
[02:22:51.159 --> 02:22:59.022]  And as you know, the people who join the intelligence community, more than anything else, they love their country and they want to serve their country.
[02:22:59.462 --> 02:23:12.488]  And what they're seeing, you know, with the Bilderbergers and such, is this creation of a global network of giant cartels, more powerful than any nation on the planet, destined to control the necessities of life,
[02:23:13.408 --> 02:23:19.390]  Of the rest of humanity who do not work for the country and do not represent our and their interests.
[02:23:19.770 --> 02:23:25.231]  Which is why they're so absolutely paranoid of what might happen if this man gets eliminated.
[02:23:25.552 --> 02:23:27.992]  Because again, we have to do something now.
[02:23:28.012 --> 02:23:29.673]  We're at the end of the end.
[02:23:29.693 --> 02:23:31.413]  This isn't the beginning of the end.
[02:23:31.753 --> 02:23:41.296]  Unless we can do something over a very short term, the window of opportunity to get this world back is closing rapidly.
[02:23:41.903 --> 02:23:42.803]  Let's explain that.
[02:23:42.923 --> 02:23:44.304]  They are monopoly men.
[02:23:44.324 --> 02:23:49.666]  I've got Aaron Dice coming in for like five minutes later because he's just written a big article about, we know Rick Perry went to Bilderberg.
[02:23:50.246 --> 02:23:53.988]  Now the mainstream news is talking about him being Giuliani's running mate.
[02:23:54.728 --> 02:23:55.888]  They're both involved.
[02:23:55.928 --> 02:23:58.569]  Giuliani's over the North American Union Highway System.
[02:23:59.590 --> 02:24:03.931]  His law firm literally has a contract with Sentra with the roads being handed over.
[02:24:04.852 --> 02:24:08.093]  We see the corporate interlocking structures literally
[02:24:08.493 --> 02:24:11.039]  Stepping into the positions of government administration.
[02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:12.844]  I mean, they're openly taking over.
[02:24:12.884 --> 02:24:13.586]  Can you speak to that?
[02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:15.100]  Well, absolutely.
[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:30.850]  I mean, you're looking at the oligarchy, which is basically, essentially, a private criminal enterprise, which stretches across the globe, operating through a network of government agencies, private institutions, and both publicly owned and private corporations and financial institutions.
[02:24:31.210 --> 02:24:37.354]  Now, this extended network, and you and I have talked about this before, stretches all the way back to the Middle Ages.
[02:24:37.414 --> 02:24:41.737]  Again, this is what used to be called the family's fondio funds.
[02:24:42.287 --> 02:24:54.557]  You know, oligarchical families and their monies pulled together for maximum effect and deployed through a network of financial institutions, which hide their origins from the unsuspecting public.
[02:24:54.918 --> 02:25:01.063]  And again, unless people see it, they don't believe it, which is what the mass media entertainment has done to us.
[02:25:01.543 --> 02:25:08.469]  And they will laugh in our face, the people, because they can't see that beyond the reality of a television set.
[02:25:08.909 --> 02:25:13.070]  There's another reality, far more terrifying and far more real.
[02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:17.512]  And that is what you and I have been doing, trying to get this reality out.
[02:25:20.272 --> 02:25:22.313]  How do you see this collision playing out?
[02:25:22.393 --> 02:25:28.395]  Because the globalists now recognize that they're facing more and more opposition, but they seem to be accelerating their program.
[02:25:30.089 --> 02:25:36.393]  Well, I think again, Alex, to go back to the tried and true cliché, I think it's the people are leading this fight.
[02:25:36.773 --> 02:25:46.580]  And the European Constitution, which is actually not a constitution, it's a watered-down version of a constitution, was signed yesterday, I believe, in Lisbon.
[02:25:46.860 --> 02:25:51.563]  It only goes to show you that they couldn't ram it through the Europeans.
[02:25:52.003 --> 02:26:04.930]  Because the French and the Dutch said absolutely no, so what they've done is they've created another version which basically bypasses people's votes and goes right to the technocrats and their opinion making.
[02:26:04.950 --> 02:26:08.212]  That's dictatorial system.
[02:26:08.232 --> 02:26:09.493]  That's dictatorship right there.
[02:26:10.576 --> 02:26:32.846]  Well, you know, if you read the European press, what they're basically telling you is that we are very, very lucky, we the people in Europe, that we don't have to worry about these trivial, tribal, you know, piddly things such as the Constitution, and we can just go on and do our things and let the bureaucrats and the politicians take care of all these other things which we supposedly don't want anything to do with.
[02:26:33.306 --> 02:26:44.258]  Of course, that is not exactly the case, because again, the European Constitution, or whatever this document that they're calling it is, it has destroyed the concept of nation-states.
[02:26:44.739 --> 02:26:53.068]  It has destroyed the concept of national constitutions, because now, as of this very moment, the European Constitution takes precedence
[02:26:53.548 --> 02:26:54.449]  Well, it certainly is.
[02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:55.149]  I mean, how obvious is this?
[02:26:55.169 --> 02:26:57.111]  How they created Europe by stealth.
[02:26:57.131 --> 02:27:01.673]  Now they're fully getting rid of the last vestiges of national sovereignty and any liberty or transparency.
[02:27:17.060 --> 02:27:19.342]  It's the same thing they're doing with the American Union.
[02:27:19.362 --> 02:27:28.130]  I want you to talk about, as you did on Coast to Coast AM a month ago with me, and George, about how they've already got Blackwater up there running security in Canada.
[02:27:28.410 --> 02:27:34.756]  The merger is already happening with our guest Daniel Estill and his new book, published in the U.S.
[02:27:36.458 --> 02:27:37.358]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.839 --> 02:27:39.460]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:43.064]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.719 --> 02:27:53.160]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:27:53.580 --> 02:27:58.301]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:27:58.701 --> 02:28:01.322]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:28:01.822 --> 02:28:05.243]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:28:06.003 --> 02:28:10.324]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:28:10.764 --> 02:28:13.944]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:28:14.544 --> 02:28:17.385]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:28:18.166 --> 02:28:20.307]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:28:20.347 --> 02:28:22.108]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:28:22.128 --> 02:28:22.228]  U.S.
[02:28:22.328 --> 02:28:24.550]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[02:28:24.570 --> 02:28:24.850]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:25.750]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:28:25.770 --> 02:28:26.431]  Ask for George.
[02:28:45.842 --> 02:28:50.405]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:28:50.805 --> 02:28:53.766]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:28:54.067 --> 02:28:56.628]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:28:56.988 --> 02:29:01.811]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:29:02.191 --> 02:29:07.574]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:29:07.874 --> 02:29:10.836]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:29:11.016 --> 02:29:11.597]  We're good to go.
[02:29:34.418 --> 02:29:39.890]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:29:39.910 --> 02:29:40.351]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:29:46.238 --> 02:29:48.079]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:29:48.219 --> 02:29:53.403]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:29:53.563 --> 02:29:54.904]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:29:55.164 --> 02:30:03.369]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:30:03.570 --> 02:30:09.353]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:30:09.373 --> 02:30:11.235]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:30:11.315 --> 02:30:13.436]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:30:13.596 --> 02:30:17.859]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:30:18.019 --> 02:30:20.160]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:30:20.240 --> 02:30:28.065]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:30:28.865 --> 02:30:30.265]  We're going to go right back to
[02:30:58.596 --> 02:31:02.139]  Daniel Estelin, best-selling author in over 25 nations.
[02:31:02.739 --> 02:31:05.241]  Now his book is in its second printing, already sold out.
[02:31:05.301 --> 02:31:09.484]  We have some of the only copies available at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:10.284 --> 02:31:12.966]  It's the true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:31:12.986 --> 02:31:19.991]  It's hundreds of photos, documents, super read, and again, available discounted out of the gates.
[02:31:20.011 --> 02:31:23.574]  $26 in bookstores, $19.95 at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:23.594 --> 02:31:25.415]  You can also get in-game discounted with it.
[02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:31.995]  We're going to go back to Daniel Esterlin in just a moment and try to really pick his brain.
[02:31:32.035 --> 02:31:42.125]  But right now, for about the next three minutes, Trevor Lyman, the man that came up with the idea of the money bomb, or he took the idea and ran with it, 4.3 mil raised for Congressman Ron Paul, November 5th.
[02:31:42.185 --> 02:31:44.668]  Remember, remember, the 5th of November.
[02:31:45.028 --> 02:31:45.769]  Well, now...
[02:31:47.236 --> 02:31:50.337]  Now they've got the hundreds of thousands to get the blimp up.
[02:31:50.357 --> 02:31:53.237]  They're over Burlington, North Carolina, in the air right now.
[02:31:53.297 --> 02:31:54.698]  He's here to give you the itinerary.
[02:31:55.138 --> 02:31:57.738]  And we've got 32,000 plus pledges.
[02:31:58.138 --> 02:32:03.979]  Looking like it'll be at least 7 million of those pledges come in for the Money Bomb Sunday.
[02:32:04.079 --> 02:32:06.340]  Don't forget it this Sunday.
[02:32:06.600 --> 02:32:09.440]  Go to RonPaul2008.com and donate.
[02:32:09.541 --> 02:32:11.681]  I'm going to have a lot of people I know who believe in Ron Paul.
[02:32:11.701 --> 02:32:13.301]  I'm going to remind them to do that.
[02:32:13.721 --> 02:32:15.162]  And my wife isn't maxed out yet.
[02:32:15.202 --> 02:32:16.242]  She's going to max out on the $2,300
[02:32:17.802 --> 02:32:20.644]  He just dropped in the blimp!
[02:32:22.025 --> 02:32:22.085]  Ah!
[02:32:22.125 --> 02:32:24.106]  Why don't you call him back?
[02:32:24.166 --> 02:32:27.207]  I've got to have a live report from the blimp.
[02:32:27.247 --> 02:32:30.489]  I'm sure Daniel will want to say something to him once you get him on.
[02:32:31.469 --> 02:32:34.091]  But he is in the air, thousands of feet in the air in the blimp.
[02:32:34.711 --> 02:32:40.014]  I mean, again, Ron Paul is this focal point, Daniel Esteland, unleashing the power of the people.
[02:32:40.474 --> 02:32:42.235]  I'm not surprised the establishment's scared.
[02:32:44.332 --> 02:32:45.353]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:32:45.373 --> 02:32:46.273]  You're absolutely right.
[02:32:46.293 --> 02:32:48.294]  You're looking at all the other candidates out there.
[02:32:48.334 --> 02:32:51.736]  You're looking at the Hillary Clintons, at the John Edwards.
[02:32:52.216 --> 02:32:58.759]  All of these people belong to the Bilderberg Club, belong to the Trilateral Commission, members of the CFR, Skull and Bones.
[02:32:59.218 --> 02:32:59.578]  I don't know.
[02:33:20.515 --> 02:33:28.501]  I mean, you've talked to George W. Bush, and you've asked him about the, what was it, the Bohemian Grove, or was it the Scully Bowl?
[02:33:28.541 --> 02:33:32.124]  The CFR, and he had me kidnapped, yeah.
[02:33:32.144 --> 02:33:48.657]  That's right, and I remember you being arrested, and I mean, this is what they do to us, and you have a Ron Paul out there, who's actually as clean as a whistle, because you know, had any of these people had any goods on them whatsoever, it would have been on the front page of the New York Times.
[02:33:49.605 --> 02:33:53.148]  Well, yeah, I mean, he exercises every morning at 5 a.m.
[02:33:53.588 --> 02:33:55.770]  He eats like a bird, as his son said.
[02:33:55.790 --> 02:33:58.232]  I mean, he really, he is into virtue.
[02:33:58.272 --> 02:33:59.473]  He's very virtuous.
[02:34:01.014 --> 02:34:01.514]  Exactly.
[02:34:01.875 --> 02:34:18.565]  So again, let's just hope and pray that he stays healthy, and that people really use Ron Paul as a rallying cry to get our country, your country, the United States, to get North America back as individual nation states who can work together, but we don't need to be three nations in one.
[02:34:18.925 --> 02:34:20.186]  Oh, and by the way, Alex,
[02:34:21.126 --> 02:34:25.388]  They are working on the North American Constitution, in case you're interested.
[02:34:25.428 --> 02:34:39.535]  Yeah, break all that down and explain how the integration, the governments are paid off by the corporations, interlocking members of the government are also on these international boards and corporate boards, how they're merging them right now and how deep we're already into this integration.
[02:34:40.291 --> 02:34:40.851]  Well, exactly.
[02:34:40.871 --> 02:34:42.732]  It's a self-perpetuating system.
[02:34:42.772 --> 02:34:53.197]  It's a virtual spider web of interlocked financial, political, economic, and industry interests, with a Venetian entre-montagne fondue model at the center.
[02:34:53.517 --> 02:35:03.361]  It is dynamic in a sense that it changes with the times, absorbs and creates new parts, new members, new corporations, while excreting the remains of the decaying parts.
[02:35:03.941 --> 02:35:08.866]  Members come and go, corporations come and go, but the system itself has not changed.
[02:35:09.326 --> 02:35:29.043]  And basically what you have is the new North American Constitution being put together, and again, I know that this is being put together now, because one of the people who has been invited as a consultant is a man by the name of Javier Solana, who is a former member of the socialist government in Spain, one of the most corrupt governments in the history of Spain,
[02:35:29.543 --> 02:35:36.108]  And also a former Secretary General of NATO, and also a member of the Bilderberg Club, and also a member of the Trilateral Commission.
[02:35:36.128 --> 02:35:47.096]  Now, Solana is Europe's quintessential bureaucrat who has used all the necessary shenanigans and dirty tricks in the European Parliament to limit people's freedom of speech.
[02:35:48.536 --> 02:35:49.597]  Daniel, hold it there.
[02:35:49.617 --> 02:35:52.478]  We're only going to spend one or two minutes with Trevor Lyman.
[02:35:52.518 --> 02:35:54.278]  Stay there as we cover the North American Union.
[02:35:54.578 --> 02:35:58.820]  Trevor Lyman over North Carolina in the Ron Paul 2008 blimp.
[02:35:58.840 --> 02:35:59.600]  Who is Ron Paul?
[02:35:59.900 --> 02:36:04.962]  Trevor, give us a report from our air attack on the New World Order.
[02:36:06.222 --> 02:36:07.383]  Okay, yeah, we're up here.
[02:36:07.423 --> 02:36:09.223]  We're above Burlington, North Carolina.
[02:36:09.683 --> 02:36:11.504]  We're on our way to Charlotte.
[02:36:12.020 --> 02:36:16.144]  And then we're going to arrive at Chester Airfield at 6 p.m.
[02:36:16.164 --> 02:36:16.424]  tonight.
[02:36:16.444 --> 02:36:17.945]  It's probably going to be dark when we land.
[02:36:18.846 --> 02:36:23.550]  Then we're going to spend the whole day Saturday in that area, hitting Greensboro and down into Columbia.
[02:36:23.690 --> 02:36:26.793]  We wanted to hit South Carolina because it's the upcoming primary state.
[02:36:27.594 --> 02:36:33.379]  And then Sunday, again, because of the Tea Party, we want to be over South Carolina.
[02:36:35.450 --> 02:36:35.951]  In the air.
[02:36:36.771 --> 02:36:41.456]  We may be held down by winds for a while that day, but we really are hoping that we can get up in the air.
[02:36:42.417 --> 02:36:48.222]  But because of winds and distance, you're not going to be able to make it up to the Boston Tea Party.
[02:36:49.063 --> 02:36:50.764]  That's right, because of the snow.
[02:36:51.044 --> 02:36:56.489]  We found out that if you have snow or ice on this thing, it will destroy the balance.
[02:36:56.550 --> 02:37:01.234]  You'll have uneven weight on the top and that will cause it to spin and people can get hurt.
[02:37:01.857 --> 02:37:02.920]  So they avoid snow.
[02:37:03.642 --> 02:37:05.307]  So we're learning as we go.
[02:37:05.407 --> 02:37:09.459]  But you're going to get up to New York and the Northeast though in the next week.
[02:37:10.373 --> 02:37:10.873]  Absolutely.
[02:37:10.933 --> 02:37:14.876]  As long as there's a window there about five or six days of good weather, we're going to do it.
[02:37:15.256 --> 02:37:17.077]  Will we go up north or north-south?
[02:37:17.137 --> 02:37:21.699]  Trevor, the Money Bomb Sunday, you're going to be with me 20 minutes on the Sunday show from 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:37:21.719 --> 02:37:29.284]  in that first hour, and we'll be able to have all the latest numbers and intel from the inside from Trevor Lyman, who's launched this whole thing.
[02:37:30.244 --> 02:37:31.765]  How many pledges do we have right now?
[02:37:33.514 --> 02:37:35.754]  I believe it's about 32.
[02:37:35.834 --> 02:37:37.715]  Like you said, I have to check myself.
[02:37:37.795 --> 02:37:40.775]  Internet connection and cell phone is really spotty up here.
[02:37:41.515 --> 02:37:44.056]  But, you know, we're doing my best.
[02:37:44.876 --> 02:37:45.236]  It's over 30.
[02:37:45.376 --> 02:37:48.037]  I believe it's about 31 to 32 right now.
[02:37:48.257 --> 02:37:51.497]  Is the Blimp getting a lot of media attention?
[02:37:52.457 --> 02:37:53.057]  Yes, it is.
[02:37:53.297 --> 02:38:02.479]  We had a helicopter fly by in Raleigh, as well as some other reporters that had called in and wanted to report on it.
[02:38:03.323 --> 02:38:06.486]  Um, XM Radio wants to speak a little bit later on.
[02:38:06.526 --> 02:38:08.127]  You know, just all kinds of different places.
[02:38:08.307 --> 02:38:09.108]  So, it's great.
[02:38:09.188 --> 02:38:10.529]  It's really starting to work already.
[02:38:11.009 --> 02:38:13.011]  We will definitely go through the D.C.
[02:38:13.071 --> 02:38:13.411]  area.
[02:38:14.112 --> 02:38:17.454]  Not too close, but close enough that we'll get a lot of press there as well.
[02:38:17.654 --> 02:38:18.315]  Alright, Trevor.
[02:38:18.355 --> 02:38:25.480]  We'll have a detailed report with you on Sunday and we'll watch Tea Party 2007 dot com throughout the weekend.
[02:38:25.801 --> 02:38:26.761]  Everybody get involved.
[02:38:26.801 --> 02:38:27.542]  Trevor, thank you.
[02:38:28.587 --> 02:38:29.307]  Thank you very much.
[02:38:29.327 --> 02:38:29.887]  Awesome.
[02:38:30.188 --> 02:38:31.488]  There goes Trevor Lyman.
[02:38:31.528 --> 02:38:32.488]  Okay, sorry, Daniel.
[02:38:32.528 --> 02:38:35.529]  I've been wanting to get him on last hour, but his phone was out in the blimp.
[02:38:35.569 --> 02:38:36.370]  We were able to get him on then.
[02:38:36.410 --> 02:38:37.090]  I apologize.
[02:38:37.350 --> 02:38:40.371]  Continue with how they're already setting up the North American Union.
[02:38:40.411 --> 02:38:41.051]  You have the floor.
[02:38:42.032 --> 02:38:45.673]  Okay, well, first of all, you guys have patented the idea of the blimp, right?
[02:38:45.693 --> 02:38:49.394]  Because Hillary Clinton from this world surely will steal it from you.
[02:38:49.414 --> 02:38:51.435]  Yeah, they'll probably try.
[02:38:53.694 --> 02:39:02.859]  Anyway, as I was saying, you have the European Constitution, or some semblance of it right now, and now they're working on the North American Constitution as well.
[02:39:03.219 --> 02:39:18.787]  Again, they haven't actually physically sat down to start working on it through a working group, but what they do have, again, they have Javier Solana, who is the former member of the Spanish Socialist Party in the 1980s and early 1990s, and the former Secretary General of NATO.
[02:39:19.287 --> 02:39:30.253]  He is now being hired on as a consultant because, again, he is one of the key people who steered the entire process of European integration and European constitution.
[02:39:30.273 --> 02:39:35.435]  And, again, he is Europe's foreign minister, if you wish, to the rest of the world.
[02:39:35.916 --> 02:39:38.077]  Now, do we have a couple of minutes?
[02:39:38.097 --> 02:39:44.120]  I would very much, Alex, like to explain how the whole North American Union idea was actually put together.
[02:39:44.959 --> 02:39:47.422]  A lot of people think that it all started in Billiburg, 1996.
[02:39:47.543 --> 02:39:51.047]  I've actually finished that Billiburg, 1996.
[02:39:51.367 --> 02:39:56.794]  It goes all the way back to the early days of the Reagan-Bush presidency in 1980, early 1981.
[02:39:57.895 --> 02:39:59.017]  Do we have a couple of minutes?
[02:39:59.738 --> 02:40:00.499]  You have the floor.
[02:40:01.275 --> 02:40:02.256]  Great, thanks so much.
[02:40:02.656 --> 02:40:11.225]  Now, upon taking the reins of the country, Bush and Reagan called on the presidents of the key transnational companies and asked them for the real picture.
[02:40:11.285 --> 02:40:19.513]  Now, the money people told them that if the United States were a corporation, it would have to be shut down immediately because, according to them, it was bankrupt.
[02:40:20.091 --> 02:40:22.653]  Now, then the critical question is put to these people.
[02:40:23.114 --> 02:40:24.535]  What is the solution?
[02:40:24.955 --> 02:40:26.797]  There's only one solution, according to them.
[02:40:27.257 --> 02:40:33.643]  They say we must merge Canada politically with the United States if we are to rebalance the book.
[02:40:33.943 --> 02:40:41.790]  Now, according to their report, Canada is a virgin country, which it is, with a multitude of natural resources, water supplies, mines, oil, gas.
[02:40:43.314 --> 02:40:44.475]  I think so.
[02:41:00.926 --> 02:41:10.632]  14 or 15 years from 1980-81, it takes us to 1995, which is an important date, because in 1995 they had the Quebec referendum.
[02:41:10.672 --> 02:41:22.240]  Now, the reason that's important is the politicians and the bankers said, now, we can't merge Canada and the United States politically, because Canada has this province that speaks French.
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:25.542]  You can't integrate the two as long as Quebec is there.
[02:41:26.082 --> 02:41:28.525]  Get them to separate, said Paul Volcker.
[02:41:28.565 --> 02:41:29.887]  That was in 1981.
[02:41:30.368 --> 02:41:31.409]  How, they asked.
[02:41:31.949 --> 02:41:35.494]  Then the president of Hannah Mining, who was sitting at the table, he said,
[02:41:36.041 --> 02:41:45.265]  I have a division in Canada called the Iron Ore Company of Canada, and I have a man there by the name of Brian Mulrooney, that's Canada's future Prime Minister.
[02:41:45.725 --> 02:41:50.867]  He just shut down the town of Shefferville, Quebec, and basically destroyed an entire town.
[02:41:51.427 --> 02:41:54.388]  Shutting down Canada, he said, wouldn't be much of a problem.
[02:41:54.688 --> 02:41:55.749]  Wonderful, we all agree.
[02:41:55.789 --> 02:41:56.689]  Let's bring him in.
[02:41:57.189 --> 02:41:59.210]  But, Volcker jumps in.
[02:41:59.490 --> 02:42:01.191]  Can this Mulrooney guy be trusted?
[02:42:02.273 --> 02:42:04.615]  Well, absolutely, replies the Hannah Mining President.
[02:42:05.035 --> 02:42:17.223]  You see, he said, Mulroney once looted the company pension fund in order to start the construction of his grand pet project, the Lord's Inn, which was to be built in Labrador.
[02:42:17.563 --> 02:42:21.526]  By the way, the hotel was the exact replica of Montreal's Ritz Hotel.
[02:42:22.202 --> 02:42:25.224]  So then the bankers basically have him in their pocket.
[02:42:25.545 --> 02:42:34.072]  Now on the election day, of course, Mulroney wins, and he becomes in September 1984 the new and proud Prime Minister of Canada.
[02:42:35.052 --> 02:42:38.755]  Again, that wasn't very difficult to do, electing him as Prime Minister.
[02:42:39.256 --> 02:42:43.139]  A few years later, Mulroney became the most hated man in Canada,
[02:42:43.706 --> 02:42:44.087]  I think so.
[02:42:57.641 --> 02:43:01.104]  9-11 Truth folks confronted him at three separate events very politely.
[02:43:01.344 --> 02:43:04.887]  They would go to each book signing and give him end games, give him loose change final cuts.
[02:43:05.327 --> 02:43:11.031]  And at the last one, the guy walks up, gives it to him, and says, yeah, listen, you called for a new world order, which you did on record.
[02:43:11.592 --> 02:43:12.973]  And he's not in his space.
[02:43:12.993 --> 02:43:13.993]  He's about three feet away.
[02:43:14.294 --> 02:43:19.918]  Krejcian leans across the table, grabs his arm, and shoves him back and tells him in French, get him out of here.
[02:43:19.938 --> 02:43:26.182]  I mean, why did he go from acting fake and nice to, hey, you called for a new world order, and Krejcian just goes, yeah!
[02:43:27.363 --> 02:43:29.604]  Well, you just brought something up there.
[02:43:29.744 --> 02:43:41.186]  Again, Alex, I've been investigating the Canadian break-up since 1996, since I found out at the Bilderberg Conference in Canada that year, what these people basically had in mind.
[02:43:41.206 --> 02:43:51.628]  Now, basically, with the structure of Mulroney and the election of Chrétien, who of course was also a member of the Bilderberg elite, the Bilderbergers basically had their wet dream.
[02:43:51.928 --> 02:43:54.689]  You had one truly national party, the Liberals,
[02:43:55.209 --> 02:43:55.930]  We're good to go.
[02:44:11.770 --> 02:44:21.494]  And then you have this Reform Party, who is basically your extreme right wing, and the Quebec are saying, we're leaving, and the rest of Canadians are basically saying, go to hell.
[02:44:22.175 --> 02:44:34.780]  Now, we would have lost, we the Canadians, we would have lost Quebec, Alex, and we would have had North American Union a long time ago, had it not been for what I said before, the people leading this fight.
[02:44:35.748 --> 02:45:00.232]  You know what happened one week before the Quebec referendum in 1995, when the Rockefellers were saying, we have this all done, 38,000 people from across Canada, out of a total population of 32 million, that's 0.001%, defended on Quebec one week before, and spent an entire week pleading with Quebecers
[02:45:00.712 --> 02:45:02.094]  Not to the intended effect.
[02:45:15.652 --> 02:45:19.113]  Okay, well, we've talked about this before.
[02:45:19.453 --> 02:45:20.593]  Now, how are they doing this?
[02:45:20.633 --> 02:45:22.013]  Again, Alex, think of money.
[02:45:22.554 --> 02:45:27.375]  If you could ask Jeannie for three wishes, what would you ask for?
[02:45:27.435 --> 02:45:29.995]  Again, keeping in mind you want absolute control.
[02:45:30.015 --> 02:45:32.956]  You would want, first of all, control of the sun.
[02:45:33.036 --> 02:45:34.256]  Second, control the air.
[02:45:34.636 --> 02:45:36.437]  And third, you would want to control the water.
[02:45:36.457 --> 02:45:42.058]  Now, you know you can't control the sun and the air, but you can control the water because it's a natural resource.
[02:45:42.538 --> 02:45:59.190]  And again, in the North American Free Trade Agreement, which, by the way, no one has ever seen because it is hidden, you know, in a canister 60 miles outside of Ottawa, not to be seen for the next 30 years, there's a lot of talk that free-flowing water is free.
[02:45:59.471 --> 02:46:05.335]  Of course, bottled water is not free, and in GATT, which is General Agreement on Trades and Tariffs,
[02:46:05.734 --> 02:46:10.318]  There's a lot of talk about water becoming private property.
[02:46:10.358 --> 02:46:19.625]  So again, if you want to see how they're doing this, it's amazing the shenanigans, but you do have to admit, these are brilliant people, the Rockefellers of this world.
[02:46:19.885 --> 02:46:21.527]  We're not dealing with stupid people.
[02:46:21.547 --> 02:46:25.990]  We're dealing with some of the most diabolical, brilliant minds on the planet.
[02:46:27.031 --> 02:46:31.435]  How unfortunate that they're not working for the betterment of the humankind and against us.
[02:46:32.676 --> 02:46:33.276]  Absolutely.
[02:46:33.296 --> 02:46:35.377]  Aaron Dykes has got some questions for you.
[02:46:35.417 --> 02:46:42.481]  He's written some articles about Giuliani, these North American union groups, how he's over the law firm with Sentra, literally having the infrastructure handed to him.
[02:46:42.581 --> 02:46:43.181]  Aaron, quickly.
[02:46:43.822 --> 02:46:44.342]  Hi, Daniel.
[02:46:44.362 --> 02:46:59.450]  Yeah, on top of all the transnational TTC stuff, there's also this TXU deal, a giant utility company that just became one of the biggest buyouts of all time, principally involving KKR and Henry Kravis.
[02:46:59.470 --> 02:47:00.931]  He's made personal appearances
[02:47:01.551 --> 02:47:06.733]  And we know Rick Perry was at Bilderberg, and I was just wondering if there's any specific discussion.
[02:47:06.773 --> 02:47:09.353]  Were they troubleshooting their business deals?
[02:47:09.954 --> 02:47:13.475]  Or were they finding out if he can give a vice presidential speech properly?
[02:47:13.715 --> 02:47:17.236]  Which they're now also vetting Perry to run with him.
[02:47:17.256 --> 02:47:25.858]  I mean, bottom line, is there any intel on what was discussed between Rick Perry, King Juan Carlos, and other players in regards to Texas interest and or vice president, etc.
[02:47:26.119 --> 02:47:27.479]  during yesterday's Volterra meeting?
[02:47:29.474 --> 02:47:39.741]  No, I don't have a lot on that, but I can tell you as far as the American elections, the Guglielmi thing, I don't see him anywhere near the Republican nominee.
[02:47:39.801 --> 02:47:43.363]  I see Michael Bloomberg being selected by the man behind the curtain.
[02:47:44.084 --> 02:47:48.087]  As far as your question is concerned, I'm going to look into it more.
[02:47:48.427 --> 02:47:50.949]  I don't have enough to actually make a lot of sense.
[02:47:51.009 --> 02:47:52.770]  I prefer to keep him for the next interview, Alex.
[02:47:54.071 --> 02:48:04.436]  My whole point is that they are really integrating Perry into their higher echelons and it looks like, from every indicator, Texas is one of the main battlegrounds in the North American Union.
[02:48:05.860 --> 02:48:06.560]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:48:06.580 --> 02:48:08.381]  Texas is one of the main battlegrounds.
[02:48:08.461 --> 02:48:10.281]  It has always been one of the main battlegrounds.
[02:48:10.621 --> 02:48:12.701]  And again, one of the reasons is it has oil.
[02:48:13.222 --> 02:48:18.543]  Again, one of the natural resources that all of these men behind the curtain need for the survival of the planet.
[02:48:18.923 --> 02:48:29.065]  So again, Texas will definitely be on the agenda, which means that I'm going to have to come to Texas in February, and you and I are going to have to put on a show and make people know what these big Bilderbergers are up against.
[02:48:30.005 --> 02:48:30.565]  Absolutely.
[02:48:30.605 --> 02:48:34.706]  Final segment with Daniel Estlin right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:48:35.419 --> 02:48:40.943]  We are now only about 36 hours away from the start of the Ron Paul Money Bomb.
[02:48:41.323 --> 02:48:43.785]  Coming up this Sunday, let's raise 10 mil.
[02:48:44.045 --> 02:48:44.986]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:46.647 --> 02:48:48.048]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:48.068 --> 02:48:50.170]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.891 --> 02:48:55.174]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:55.794 --> 02:48:58.556]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:48:58.616 --> 02:49:00.798]  Both their objective be world domination.
[02:49:01.385 --> 02:49:03.828]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[02:49:04.569 --> 02:49:11.938]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.904 --> 02:49:19.907]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.367 --> 02:49:23.849]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:24.229 --> 02:49:26.750]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[02:49:26.790 --> 02:49:27.791]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.811 --> 02:49:28.731]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.751 --> 02:49:29.812]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:30.032 --> 02:49:30.812]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.832 --> 02:49:32.033]  That's what they're after, you see.
[02:49:32.153 --> 02:49:36.695]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[02:49:41.638 --> 02:49:43.279]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[02:49:43.659 --> 02:49:44.880]  You have been warned.
[02:49:45.961 --> 02:49:50.925]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:49:51.246 --> 02:49:53.488]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[02:49:53.548 --> 02:49:56.670]  Our Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:49:56.710 --> 02:50:01.014]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[02:50:01.354 --> 02:50:04.357]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:50:04.677 --> 02:50:08.100]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:17.790]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:50:18.050 --> 02:50:21.554]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:50:21.794 --> 02:50:28.901]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:50:29.462 --> 02:50:29.983]  Thank you.
[02:50:45.183 --> 02:50:45.663]  Hi, Ken.
[02:50:45.723 --> 02:50:46.483]  It's Judy again.
[02:50:46.503 --> 02:50:51.025]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[02:50:51.185 --> 02:50:54.325]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[02:50:54.546 --> 02:50:56.426]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[02:50:56.706 --> 02:50:58.767]  Huffy just sold the old gas barbecue.
[02:50:58.947 --> 02:51:05.068]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[02:51:05.268 --> 02:51:10.550]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[02:51:10.830 --> 02:51:13.691]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[02:51:13.811 --> 02:51:14.731]  Go KenSolar!
[02:51:16.016 --> 02:51:17.557]  Get the best of both worlds.

[02:51:50.511 --> 02:51:51.652]  We're almost out of time.
[02:51:52.212 --> 02:51:54.273]  I'll be back Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m.

[02:51:57.535 --> 02:52:00.137]  We're going to get Daniel probably back on next week or something.
[02:52:00.157 --> 02:52:01.478]  There's just too much to talk about with him.
[02:52:02.118 --> 02:52:06.221]  45 minutes of air time in an hour is just not enough time.
[02:52:07.161 --> 02:52:10.403]  His book, The Bilderberg Group, is available discounted.
[02:52:10.423 --> 02:52:11.604]  One of the only places you can get it.
[02:52:11.644 --> 02:52:12.604]  It's sold out everywhere.
[02:52:12.965 --> 02:52:15.226]  We just got some from the second printing and it's already gone.
[02:52:15.922 --> 02:52:17.203]  We have these in stock.
[02:52:17.223 --> 02:52:18.864]  The Milkenberg Group, $19.95.

[02:52:35.176 --> 02:52:37.998]  Before we go back to Daniel and the last 3 or 4 minutes we have left with him,

[02:52:48.725 --> 02:52:54.008]  And it's got a bunch of key nutrients there in their natural form in the cocoa.
[02:52:54.488 --> 02:52:56.569]  Very inexpensive as well.

[02:53:16.079 --> 02:53:16.939]  Just go check them out.
[02:53:16.999 --> 02:53:17.820]  InnerFood.com or 866-762-9238.
[02:53:17.840 --> 02:53:17.900]  866-762-9238.
[02:53:17.940 --> 02:53:18.460]  InnerFood.com.
[02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:21.141]  Daniel, you were raving about Endgame during one of the breaks.
[02:53:21.161 --> 02:53:22.242]  We never really talked about that.
[02:53:32.086 --> 02:53:43.890]  In a minute or two, give me your analysis of what you think about Endgame, because you've now seen it, and also just any closing comments about the fight against the New World Order and the Bilderbergs' current state and their agenda.
[02:53:44.891 --> 02:53:47.852]  Well, first of all, Alex, I'm, you know, honored to have been part of the Endgame.
[02:53:47.932 --> 02:53:51.473]  I'm so grateful that you actually wanted to interview and have me in the show.
[02:53:51.893 --> 02:53:53.094]  I talked to several people.
[02:53:53.234 --> 02:53:56.735]  One of them is Richard Seier from Toronto, from 1010 CFRB in Toronto.
[02:53:56.775 --> 02:54:00.977]  He said when he presented Endgame a couple of weeks ago in Toronto,
[02:54:01.826 --> 02:54:04.349]  You know, the turnout was absolutely tremendous.
[02:54:04.369 --> 02:54:09.335]  You had people waiting in line-ups for hours on end to try to get in and actually see the endgame.
[02:54:09.776 --> 02:54:17.706]  Again, what you have done is galvanized a movement, which you actually have done in the documentary, because again, folks, it's not enough just to listen to Alex.
[02:54:17.766 --> 02:54:19.228]  I mean, that's an experience in itself.
[02:54:19.788 --> 02:54:32.651]  Get the endgame and find out how he dissects the New World Order, builds a burger-led agenda, and how he puts together in that whole concept of what these people are applying to do to us in the near future.
[02:54:32.671 --> 02:54:38.012]  Because again, there is no long future unless we stand up and we be counted.
[02:54:38.412 --> 02:54:41.413]  And if you actually want to understand how that whole thing was put together,
[02:54:42.253 --> 02:54:53.465]  Get the Bilderberg book, get Endgame, get these two presents for your friends and family for Christmas, because again, we need everybody to come out and support not only us, but also people like Ron Paul.
[02:54:53.525 --> 02:54:56.768]  Don't vote for second best, vote for the best.
[02:54:56.929 --> 02:54:58.230]  Ron Paul for president.
[02:54:58.951 --> 02:54:59.471]  Absolutely.
[02:54:59.491 --> 02:55:01.173]  In the minute and a half we've got left, Daniel.
[02:55:01.193 --> 02:55:02.875]  Fire out your excellent website.
[02:55:04.229 --> 02:55:13.512]  It's www.danielestulin.com.
[02:55:13.532 --> 02:55:15.432]  There's a lot of stuff in Spanish and in English.
[02:55:15.533 --> 02:55:20.894]  Documents, secret Bilderberger agendas, lots of photographs, lots of things for people to see.
[02:55:20.954 --> 02:55:26.916]  We get about 10,000 hits a day, which is pretty good because it's a one-man operation.
[02:55:27.416 --> 02:55:29.137]  But a lot of it is one-man operation.
[02:55:29.177 --> 02:55:34.801]  There are very few people like you, Alex, that actually have a team of professionals working out there.
[02:55:34.821 --> 02:55:35.342]  We need you.
[02:55:35.582 --> 02:55:37.443]  Look how far we've all come.
[02:55:37.503 --> 02:55:39.925]  Nobody knew about the Bilderberg Group ten years ago, five years ago.
[02:55:39.945 --> 02:55:41.126]  Now it's being discussed.
[02:55:41.426 --> 02:55:42.727]  Does that anger the Bilderberg Group?
[02:55:43.662 --> 02:55:59.796]  Well, I think it is, but again, you know, we have to deal with the great unwashed, the masses who just prefer not to know and who prefer just to walk away, to turn their back on the truth and say, well, you just have a nice day, things will get better on their own.
[02:56:00.156 --> 02:56:05.360]  Things won't get better because we won't have a country to fight for unless we stand up.
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:08.503]  And a final comment, Alex, final comment, ten seconds.
[02:56:09.043 --> 02:56:15.229]  We can win this war where the power of love overcomes the law of power, and that is a guarantee.
[02:56:15.810 --> 02:56:16.651]  Daniel, God bless you.
[02:56:16.671 --> 02:56:18.032]  I'm going to have my producer call you right now.
[02:56:18.052 --> 02:56:21.776]  I want to set you up for an hour next week to take calls, and have a great Christmas.
[02:56:22.056 --> 02:56:22.877]  God bless you all.
[02:56:22.917 --> 02:56:25.139]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:25.259 --> 02:56:25.920]  I'm Danny Wolf.
[02:56:27.841 --> 02:56:29.924]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:56:30.464 --> 02:56:35.429]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:56:36.130 --> 02:56:36.610]  Hello folks.
