[00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:32.302]  You are listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:39.463 --> 00:00:40.123]  Big Brother.
[00:00:40.763 --> 00:00:41.843]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:42.544 --> 00:00:43.684]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:43.704 --> 00:00:45.124]  You want answers?
[00:00:45.864 --> 00:00:46.844]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:51.385]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:55.686]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:59.022 --> 00:01:14.094]  The Mexican government for three years has been giving survival packs, backpacks, to their citizens to come into the United States and then act as dual citizens to undermine the republic.
[00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:26.745]  Now the federal government of Mexico has announced, we'll be covering the article later in this hour, that they're going to be issuing GPS systems to the
[00:01:27.848 --> 00:01:29.489]  Immigrants coming across the border.
[00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.472]  I mean, this is a military invasion by every yardstick.
[00:01:36.453 --> 00:01:41.136]  And please, folks, I love you to death and I appreciate everybody out there.
[00:01:41.316 --> 00:01:44.538]  Please don't call me with lots of get-well remedies.
[00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.021]  I am announcing this, obviously, so you don't think I've come in here with a whole new voice.
[00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:53.324]  I thought I had allergies the last three days, but now I got one whopper of a fever.
[00:01:55.268 --> 00:02:01.854]  And I planned to go on vacation a few days, not this week, but the next week, so I don't want to miss any more shows.
[00:02:03.175 --> 00:02:06.578]  And so I'm here today, plus I have a very important guest coming on in the second hour.
[00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:22.411]  But I'm going to take, I don't always say this, but today you watch, it's going to happen, I'm going to take a lot of calls in the first hour, and we have a guest on in the second hour, and I'll have wide open phones in the third hour as well.
[00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:26.206]  So, that is coming up.
[00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:28.667]  The toll-free number to join us, you can talk about anything you want.
[00:02:28.827 --> 00:02:44.633]  The Saddam execution, the dollar plunging, talk of attacking Iran, the police state, good things that are happening, the Democrats being heckled yesterday by anti-war protesters.
[00:02:45.713 --> 00:02:48.394]  The Democrats, of course, are doing the opposite of what they said they'd do.
[00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:50.995]  They're going to escalate the war, not de-escalate.
[00:02:53.047 --> 00:03:08.674]  In fact, I meant to send you, John, a clip that's up on PrisonPlanet.com, a news clip of him protesting and taking over the disgusting Nancy Pelosi press conference where she shot her mouth off about how she's the most powerful woman in America.
[00:03:09.615 --> 00:03:11.715]  I have power!
[00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:13.376]  We don't care if women have power, folks.
[00:03:13.396 --> 00:03:17.218]  It's just that she's a total puppet and runs absolutely nothing.
[00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:21.188]  I mean, and there are a lot of powerful women, don't get me wrong.
[00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:24.590]  Did you know over 75% of the wealth in the U.S.
[00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.431]  is held by women?
[00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:31.595]  And it goes for royalty, too, because women... Taipei men tend to die at about 55-60.
[00:03:33.176 --> 00:03:38.139]  Women usually live 6 years longer than an average male, but Taipei males usually die about 20 years before.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.522]  And these Taipei women tend to live even longer, 80-90.
[00:03:43.183 --> 00:03:44.664]  So women do run the world.
[00:03:44.744 --> 00:03:46.265]  I just want to let you know some of the top
[00:03:47.438 --> 00:03:53.841]  Bloodthirsty killers of the New World Order, some of their top lords, are these great queen bees.
[00:03:54.042 --> 00:04:00.445]  I'm not here saying women are powerful, but Pelosi, I am the most powerful woman in America!
[00:04:01.605 --> 00:04:03.106]  Uh, yeah, sure you are.
[00:04:04.607 --> 00:04:06.688]  You and George Bush are nothing but puppets.
[00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.952]  Negroponte, Condoleezza Rice, Jeb Bush, all of them snot-nosed, un-American trash.
[00:04:15.018 --> 00:04:18.399]  In collusion, working together against the people of the world.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.241]  I literally have giant stacks of news here.
[00:04:22.341 --> 00:04:24.901]  Cameras going in, school bathrooms coast-to-coast.
[00:04:25.922 --> 00:04:29.243]  Feds putting in microphones with cameras coast-to-coast.
[00:04:30.423 --> 00:04:34.345]  FEMA command centers with the CIA running them in the mainstream news, finally.
[00:04:34.885 --> 00:04:36.545]  FEMA camp articles everywhere.
[00:04:37.686 --> 00:04:40.827]  From Indiana to Texas to California.
[00:04:42.603 --> 00:05:08.608]  I want to talk about Saddam because it's really the story's getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger but I can't really do justice to it I think today with my uh... I don't know why I just I uh... I mean everybody's sick in Austin it seems and uh... I also have an abominable crick in my neck I don't know why I'm saying that on air I just uh... It should be an interesting broadcast today
[00:05:09.562 --> 00:05:13.063]  I guess having a 101 point something fever will be the truth serum here on air.
[00:05:13.783 --> 00:05:16.843]  Lord knows what I'll be saying.
[00:05:18.464 --> 00:05:20.284]  I may tell you what I really think on a few issues.
[00:05:21.124 --> 00:05:22.685]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:05:22.705 --> 00:05:22.985]  Huge broadcast.
[00:05:23.005 --> 00:05:26.685]  Tell you about the guest that's coming up as well on the other side.
[00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:41.481]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.783]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:51.812]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:52.478 --> 00:05:59.540]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:59.941 --> 00:06:11.324]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:11.665 --> 00:06:15.186]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:15.626 --> 00:06:17.587]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:17.887 --> 00:06:21.728]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:40.171]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[00:06:40.351 --> 00:06:42.432]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[00:06:42.672 --> 00:06:49.793]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:06:49.913 --> 00:07:01.436]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[00:07:01.816 --> 00:07:09.204]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[00:07:09.484 --> 00:07:14.469]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.595]  Disconnect your application, the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[00:07:19.895 --> 00:07:25.984]  Get the Incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:26.004 --> 00:07:30.050]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:07:30.331 --> 00:07:31.332]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:07:34.975 --> 00:07:35.555]  It's a fact.
[00:07:35.735 --> 00:07:40.178]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:07:40.638 --> 00:07:45.820]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[00:07:46.121 --> 00:07:49.322]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[00:07:49.562 --> 00:07:56.686]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[00:07:57.046 --> 00:08:04.252]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[00:08:04.672 --> 00:08:06.514]  We also do credit restoration.
[00:08:06.974 --> 00:08:13.280]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.263]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[00:08:17.643 --> 00:08:20.205]  Call Day of Jubilee, open 9 a.m.
[00:08:20.245 --> 00:08:21.066]  to 5 p.m.
[00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:24.368]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[00:08:25.169 --> 00:08:28.212]  That's 920-293-8024.
[00:08:29.773 --> 00:08:30.834]  And ask for Robert.
[00:08:31.254 --> 00:08:34.296]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[00:08:35.397 --> 00:08:40.962]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:43.584 --> 00:08:44.985]  Alright, let's get it straight.
[00:08:46.073 --> 00:08:53.815]  There are checkpoints being run, federally funded at the state level, well upon the process of becoming federalized, centralized, tyrannized.
[00:08:54.635 --> 00:08:58.356]  There are checkpoints going every night in every major county of the country.
[00:08:59.877 --> 00:09:05.758]  Where the police just randomly want your driver's license, your registration, they snoop, they ask you questions, where are you going?
[00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:06.719]  You know, that's freedom.
[00:09:07.119 --> 00:09:10.940]  A free country, just like it's the airport, just answer their questions.
[00:09:11.815 --> 00:09:20.699]  And we posted a video last night of a 19-year-old, a very polite young man, in Missouri.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.661]  And it's a checkpoint, and he's sick of being stopped at the checkpoint.
[00:09:24.681 --> 00:09:25.781]  They're having a whole bunch there.
[00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:27.042]  I guess it was Kansas City.
[00:09:28.282 --> 00:09:33.265]  And so he gives the officer the license, the ID card, the national ID card.
[00:09:34.125 --> 00:09:35.806]  And he gives him the registration.
[00:09:35.826 --> 00:09:37.226]  And the officer says, where are you going tonight?
[00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:37.627]  What are you doing?
[00:09:37.667 --> 00:09:38.307]  And he said, you know what?
[00:09:38.327 --> 00:09:40.508]  I don't want to discuss my private life with you.
[00:09:41.741 --> 00:09:43.121]  Alright, get out of the car.
[00:09:43.401 --> 00:09:46.342]  It's like a 15 minute tape, but I watched it last night.
[00:09:47.002 --> 00:09:49.822]  And the cops are getting in the car because they don't know the young man has a camera.
[00:09:51.363 --> 00:09:53.103]  And they're in there laughing about him.
[00:09:53.883 --> 00:10:00.004]  It's not like the video we aired, we put up on Jones Report a few weeks ago that I forgot to play on the radio.
[00:10:02.045 --> 00:10:03.745]  Maybe we'll go dig that up today and play it.
[00:10:04.905 --> 00:10:08.946]  Where one of my personal friends had a hidden camera in his car.
[00:10:10.353 --> 00:10:15.957]  And the police come up, and they want to search it, and he says no, and they say get out of the car.
[00:10:17.137 --> 00:10:21.000]  And then one of the officers talks about how he'd like to kill him.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:27.804]  And I think, you know, Big Brother wants to put cameras in all the cars watching us.
[00:10:27.944 --> 00:10:30.766]  I think everybody should be hiding cameras in their cars to watch them.
[00:10:32.467 --> 00:10:33.547]  I mean, that's the mentality.
[00:10:33.587 --> 00:10:34.988]  Our lives are so worthless.
[00:10:35.689 --> 00:10:37.610]  If people say, I don't want you searching my car,
[00:10:38.405 --> 00:10:44.247]  Cops talk about how they'd like to kill you when they're in a squad car together or in your car searching it.
[00:10:48.108 --> 00:10:53.549]  I mean, I know I'm supposed to love that and thank you for the way you behave and the way you treat us like third world slaves.
[00:10:54.789 --> 00:10:55.750]  I mean, I understand that.
[00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:03.172]  I understand I need to learn how to roll over and just totally flush down the toilet everything this country's ever been or ever will be.
[00:11:03.832 --> 00:11:04.812]  But I'm mad about it.
[00:11:09.042 --> 00:11:14.748]  The country itself has degenerated, so the police of course have degenerated by and large.
[00:11:14.788 --> 00:11:21.714]  The training, by design, is to separate the people from the police as we spiral down this rat hole.
[00:11:24.377 --> 00:11:30.423]  But I start the broadcast talking about that issue because you think about all the scrutiny we go through.
[00:11:30.463 --> 00:11:33.466]  Now the feds show up with viper teams and
[00:11:34.139 --> 00:11:38.501]  Dallas and Houston and Miami and they just randomly search people in shopping malls.
[00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:41.702]  It's federal police in black uniforms just, line up!
[00:11:41.742 --> 00:11:43.002]  We're randomly searching people!
[00:11:44.923 --> 00:11:49.245]  And they search people on trains and they search everybody's bags in New York, getting on the subway and they...
[00:11:51.318 --> 00:11:56.721]  They're listening to our cell phone calls and tracking when you order a pizza with any of the big pizza chains.
[00:11:57.321 --> 00:12:01.903]  They are uploading your data instantly to run it for warrants and they get a percentage of the bounty.
[00:12:01.923 --> 00:12:10.907]  Again, guilty until proven innocent because they know you're going to be giving a real location and generally a real name with a credit card to get that pizza.
[00:12:10.927 --> 00:12:12.288]  I remember that was in USA Today.
[00:12:12.308 --> 00:12:18.151]  I mean, we are just a completely surveilled, pathetic country.
[00:12:21.545 --> 00:12:22.445]  I mean, it's sad.
[00:12:23.626 --> 00:12:25.246]  And then I see a story like this.
[00:12:28.167 --> 00:12:29.527]  This is out of the Sunday Telegraph.
[00:12:29.568 --> 00:12:31.128]  It was also in the Associated Press.
[00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:33.089]  I couldn't find my AP article I had yesterday.
[00:12:33.109 --> 00:12:33.729]  I never got to.
[00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.391]  Sat Nav for Mexicans Illegally Entering U.S.
[00:12:41.931 --> 00:12:50.234]  Now, the U.S., if I'm politically correct, the AP has some headline like, Immigrants Being Given Satellite Navigation Systems.
[00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.911]  You're not even allowed to call them illegals.
[00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:57.493]  It's so precious to the corporate elite, so precious to the New World Order.
[00:12:57.893 --> 00:13:08.820]  They're so close to completely ending any future this nation has by flooding us with illegal aliens to balkanize and have sectarian violence in the future like they've done in Iraq.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:15.904]  They're so close to their global Balkans, as Brzezinski calls it, that they're just pulling out every stop.
[00:13:18.775 --> 00:13:21.457]  Sat Nav for Mexicans illegally entering U.S.
[00:13:21.658 --> 00:13:25.240]  Illegal immigrants planning to cross the desert and enter the U.S.
[00:13:25.301 --> 00:13:31.185]  on foot are being given handheld satellite devices by the Mexican authorities to ensure they arrive safely.
[00:13:32.146 --> 00:13:42.895]  And in past reports, the Mexican troops surveil the Border Patrol, surveil the few hundred National Guard that are down there for show, and drive by truck
[00:13:43.553 --> 00:13:44.254]  The illegal aliens.
[00:13:44.274 --> 00:13:46.355]  And of course, they're shaking their people down.
[00:13:46.395 --> 00:13:46.955]  They prod them.
[00:13:46.975 --> 00:13:47.576]  They poke them.
[00:13:48.416 --> 00:13:50.357]  I mean, I've seen Mexican troops all over Mexico.
[00:13:51.678 --> 00:13:54.960]  The people just bow down and lick their boots, like we'll do as Americans here.
[00:13:55.501 --> 00:14:01.965]  It just makes me so angry to watch them point their machine guns at people and to watch people in a uniform grovel.
[00:14:03.386 --> 00:14:04.807]  We'll be like that soon.
[00:14:04.847 --> 00:14:05.987]  We're already almost there.
[00:14:06.108 --> 00:14:12.772]  See, the journey from being free and upright and land of the free and home of the brave, feared by everybody in the world when Americans went to war.
[00:14:14.193 --> 00:14:19.335]  Two just, two just mindless, you know, oiled yuppies.
[00:14:22.116 --> 00:14:25.117]  All talking about their double lattes and their skin creams.
[00:14:26.937 --> 00:14:28.678]  I guess in a way it's kind of good.
[00:14:28.738 --> 00:14:30.538]  You get to be slaves, you scum.
[00:14:30.558 --> 00:14:35.240]  I'm gonna wipe that sick smile off your little faces.
[00:14:36.565 --> 00:14:37.405]  I have rights.
[00:14:37.425 --> 00:14:38.686]  They're taking my property.
[00:14:38.706 --> 00:14:39.766]  I have rights.
[00:14:40.306 --> 00:14:41.527]  They're taking my guns.
[00:14:41.607 --> 00:14:42.807]  I love George Bush.
[00:14:43.327 --> 00:14:44.008]  I have rights.
[00:14:44.048 --> 00:14:45.508]  They're drafting my children.
[00:14:47.649 --> 00:14:52.691]  But again, when you give your kids the shots full of mercury and they go autistic, you're so weak minded you never even admit to yourself.
[00:14:53.171 --> 00:14:58.673]  See, a lot of you I warn or others warn, but even after you brain damage your kids, you never admit it to yourself.
[00:14:58.713 --> 00:15:01.614]  Hell, you have more kids and you give them the shots, most of you.
[00:15:04.542 --> 00:15:05.742]  Because you love death.
[00:15:05.782 --> 00:15:07.103]  You love being a slave.
[00:15:07.123 --> 00:15:09.784]  Alright, I gotta watch it.
[00:15:09.864 --> 00:15:12.645]  For those who just tuned in, if I sound different, I'm not drunk or something.
[00:15:12.705 --> 00:15:13.385]  I have a fever.
[00:15:14.886 --> 00:15:18.427]  But I have a big guest coming on today, and I don't want to miss the show, so I'm here.
[00:15:18.447 --> 00:15:20.087]  I have a horrible neck ache.
[00:15:20.228 --> 00:15:22.068]  I'm like an invalid or something today.
[00:15:23.409 --> 00:15:27.490]  It took a lot of energy to get out of the bed, but I am here, and so please put up with me.
[00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:32.612]  Sat Nav for Mexicans illegally entering the U.S.
[00:15:35.552 --> 00:15:38.634]  Illegal immigrants planning to cross the desert and enter the U.S.
[00:15:38.734 --> 00:15:45.918]  on foot are to be given handheld satellite devices by the Mexican authorities.
[00:15:46.418 --> 00:15:47.759]  The officials.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.361]  See, we're the civilians.
[00:15:50.441 --> 00:15:51.461]  See, we don't have that term.
[00:15:51.481 --> 00:15:58.045]  I mean, they called them officials and authorities in Ceausescu's Romania and Mexico 50 years ago, see?
[00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:02.868]  We have just adopted the nomenclature of slaves ourselves as of late.
[00:16:04.093 --> 00:16:06.996]  The journey into bondage continuing.
[00:16:07.016 --> 00:16:13.141]  Illegal immigrants planning to cross the desert and enter the U.S.
[00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:23.751]  on foot are to be given handheld satellite devices by Mexican authorities to ensure they arrive safely.
[00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:35.621]  Those who get lost or fall sick during the dangerous four-day crossing will be able to activate the device to alert Frontier Police on both sides of the border.
[00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:43.748]  The Satellite Tracking Service will require would-be illegals to register their intentions before setting off.
[00:16:44.789 --> 00:16:49.174]  A paradoxical move given the security is necessary for success.
[00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:59.477]  But Mexican authorities are predicting that about 200,000 devices will be handed out when the project is launched formally in the coming year.
[00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:07.248]  Our intention is to save lives, said Jaime Orbegon, the coordinator for the State Commission for Migrants
[00:17:08.286 --> 00:17:16.048]  In Puebla, the Mexican state which is behind the project, there are lots of people looking to cross and we are working with the U.S.
[00:17:16.108 --> 00:17:19.628]  authorities to make sure they do not die on the way.
[00:17:19.648 --> 00:17:22.529]  Our government has put in water stations there too.
[00:17:23.749 --> 00:17:25.629]  Of course, I've seen the numbers.
[00:17:25.649 --> 00:17:33.051]  60 plus percent of those dying are not dying of snake bite or heat exhaustion.
[00:17:34.401 --> 00:17:38.843]  They're being robbed by the Mexican coyotes on both sides of the border.
[00:17:39.924 --> 00:17:41.444]  And no one's there to protect them.
[00:17:43.746 --> 00:17:45.386]  And no one's going to protect them.
[00:17:46.127 --> 00:17:50.349]  It's in the local Arizona, New Mexico, and South Texas news, but never nationally.
[00:17:51.709 --> 00:17:54.231]  The grenade attacks, the rocket attacks, the 800 deaths in 2005 alone.
[00:17:58.149 --> 00:18:01.091]  I haven't seen the 06 numbers, they always come out months after the year ends.
[00:18:01.732 --> 00:18:04.854]  Just in Texas alone, the truck bombs going off in Dallas.
[00:18:07.797 --> 00:18:09.778]  People being machine-gunned here in Austin.
[00:18:09.818 --> 00:18:11.780]  It's all kept very quiet.
[00:18:13.041 --> 00:18:17.084]  Like three cases of leprosy in the 50 years before 2000.
[00:18:17.684 --> 00:18:27.092]  And from 2000 to 2003, seven plus thousand cases and a new leper colony started outside Palestine, Texas.
[00:18:29.042 --> 00:18:36.946]  I have reports here today of tuberculosis spreading in pandemics all over schools around the nation but still kept very quiet.
[00:18:36.966 --> 00:18:37.627]  A few articles.
[00:18:40.028 --> 00:18:41.769]  Spinal meningitis spreading.
[00:18:42.569 --> 00:18:45.951]  No, we don't try to treat the illegals coming in.
[00:18:47.412 --> 00:18:53.755]  They're allowed to do whatever they want because they serve a purpose of destroying the middle class and bringing us into the new world order.
[00:18:55.376 --> 00:18:56.617]  I have articles today
[00:18:57.888 --> 00:19:01.972]  about the drug-resistant and immune TB epidemic.
[00:19:02.112 --> 00:19:07.337]  Some schools, public schools, are closed because parents are freaking out.
[00:19:07.357 --> 00:19:08.878]  They're having trouble keeping it quiet.
[00:19:09.439 --> 00:19:16.725]  Thirty-plus percent of the students in some schools are testing positive for tuberculosis.
[00:19:18.226 --> 00:19:19.107]  And it won't stop.
[00:19:19.187 --> 00:19:20.308]  It will intensify.
[00:19:21.429 --> 00:19:23.071]  And when your child gets leprosy,
[00:19:24.091 --> 00:19:25.952]  Or when your child gets tuberculosis.
[00:19:26.272 --> 00:19:27.712]  It won't be in the newspaper.
[00:19:28.412 --> 00:19:29.473]  It won't be discussed.
[00:19:30.453 --> 00:19:36.255]  When your child goes to a sanitarium, which they've now been reopening across the nation, nothing will be done.
[00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:38.935]  This is the new America.
[00:19:40.276 --> 00:19:50.619]  It is a military attack on our dollar, on our industries, on our families, whether you're Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[00:19:52.452 --> 00:19:53.613]  The U.S.
[00:19:53.713 --> 00:19:55.254]  is being broken right now.
[00:19:55.434 --> 00:19:57.236]  Its back is being broken.
[00:19:58.477 --> 00:20:02.380]  I saw some posting on my Myspace account last night.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.143]  Oh Alex, I used to like you but I don't now.
[00:20:07.163 --> 00:20:09.085]  Look at all the alarmist headlines.
[00:20:10.906 --> 00:20:19.113]  If you aren't alarmed by what's happening, there's something wrong with you fundamentally.
[00:20:20.233 --> 00:20:22.095]  Open discussions of attacking Iran.
[00:20:23.248 --> 00:20:29.572]  The fact they're announcing that half our ground forces will be illegal aliens by the end of the decade is a crisis.
[00:20:38.378 --> 00:20:40.340]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.242]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:20:44.042 --> 00:20:52.408]  The best kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:20:53.397 --> 00:20:58.298]  Now it's cancer's turn to die, with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.
[00:20:58.939 --> 00:21:08.921]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size, without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:21:09.422 --> 00:21:11.702]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:21:12.502 --> 00:21:13.783]  For more information call 702-953-0267.
[00:21:13.803 --> 00:21:13.843]  702-953-0267.
[00:21:30.315 --> 00:21:38.338]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:39.059 --> 00:21:44.281]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[00:21:45.161 --> 00:21:51.964]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[00:21:53.058 --> 00:22:01.680]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:10.742]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:23.469 --> 00:22:24.612]  516-8736.

[00:22:35.208 --> 00:22:40.411]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:22:40.571 --> 00:22:48.656]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:22:48.917 --> 00:22:55.961]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:22:56.101 --> 00:22:57.062]  We're good to go!
[00:23:28.194 --> 00:23:29.757]  Call now and get free shipping.
[00:23:29.977 --> 00:23:30.338]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:23:34.998 --> 00:23:38.900]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:51.406]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:23:51.826 --> 00:23:52.226]  The U.S.
[00:23:52.266 --> 00:23:57.809]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:23:58.249 --> 00:24:00.470]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:24:01.211 --> 00:24:03.392]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:24:03.412 --> 00:24:06.273]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:24:06.393 --> 00:24:12.396]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:24:12.836 --> 00:24:16.178]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:24:16.258 --> 00:24:22.601]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:24:23.161 --> 00:24:27.107]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:24:27.127 --> 00:24:27.288]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:27.308 --> 00:24:27.548]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.121]  Alright, welcome back.
[00:24:52.241 --> 00:24:55.223]  I'm going to go to Bill and Jerry and Joe and Jim and Bill and everybody else.
[00:24:55.663 --> 00:25:02.147]  Coming up in the next hour, we had him on a few weeks ago, and his interview with us got a lot of attention.
[00:25:03.048 --> 00:25:04.108]  He wrote to the U.S.
[00:25:04.148 --> 00:25:06.470]  Biological Weapons Treaty, helped write the U.N.
[00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:20.559]  Treaty, and he went to school with the neocons up there at Chicago Business School with Leon Strauss, kind of the big broodmother of these Trotskyites.
[00:25:21.691 --> 00:25:28.713]  He was a supporter of fascism and any totalitarian system, communism as well, and he taught them how to set up a dictatorship.
[00:25:29.593 --> 00:25:30.753]  So he witnessed a lot of this.
[00:25:30.773 --> 00:25:33.494]  Kind of like Stanley Hilton did.
[00:25:33.674 --> 00:25:36.495]  He'll be coming on, he's writing a book called Destroying World Order, U.S.
[00:25:36.535 --> 00:25:38.755]  Imperialism in the Middle East, before and after 9-11.
[00:25:38.855 --> 00:25:40.236]  He'll be on with us in the second hour.
[00:25:40.616 --> 00:25:44.417]  We had him on where he laid out the fact that our government had to launch the anthrax attacks.
[00:25:44.937 --> 00:25:46.177]  And he went through the evidence with us.
[00:25:46.897 --> 00:25:49.678]  So, Francis, Dr. Francis A. Boyle,
[00:25:50.766 --> 00:25:53.407]  I will be joining us coming up.
[00:25:54.808 --> 00:25:57.249]  I have a bunch of news here, but let's go to the calls, as I said I would.
[00:25:57.729 --> 00:25:59.250]  Bill in Arizona, you're on the air.
[00:25:59.310 --> 00:25:59.750]  Go ahead.
[00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:00.631]  Hey, Alex.
[00:26:00.671 --> 00:26:01.571]  Hey, you hang in there.
[00:26:01.591 --> 00:26:02.331]  You're going to get better.
[00:26:03.312 --> 00:26:04.753]  Oh, and I'm only telling folks I'm six.
[00:26:04.773 --> 00:26:06.313]  I don't think it's a new host doing the show.
[00:26:06.894 --> 00:26:07.674]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:26:07.694 --> 00:26:08.074]  I got them.
[00:26:08.094 --> 00:26:09.335]  Whatever this stuff is, everybody's got it.
[00:26:09.355 --> 00:26:12.876]  I got earaches, sore throat, runny nose.
[00:26:13.016 --> 00:26:15.137]  Boy, this is not fun stuff.
[00:26:15.438 --> 00:26:18.339]  Yeah, I thought you were a new host when I turned on the radio this morning.
[00:26:19.218 --> 00:26:20.559]  Yeah, I'm crazy.
[00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:23.100]  I don't know if my wife is saying to stay in bed, but I feel worse doing that.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.381]  Yeah.
[00:26:24.721 --> 00:26:32.185]  I don't know if you're aware of this Proposition 300 here in Arizona, about the illegal aliens having to pay more tuition.
[00:26:32.565 --> 00:26:32.825]  Yes.
[00:26:33.446 --> 00:26:36.267]  Well, they're having a big rally in Glendale, Arizona.
[00:26:36.287 --> 00:26:38.468]  I wish you were up here Monday night.
[00:26:38.729 --> 00:26:42.691]  It's going to be before the bowl game, and it's going to be on national TV.
[00:26:43.391 --> 00:26:46.213]  We need a lot of people out there just to shut these people up.
[00:26:46.313 --> 00:26:48.734]  You know, a lot of Mexicans are going to be out there protesting.
[00:26:50.219 --> 00:26:51.219]  Well, that's what happens.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:55.082]  The media, the police, the system always accommodates the protest.
[00:26:55.602 --> 00:26:57.363]  Gives it total massive coverage.
[00:26:58.304 --> 00:27:00.605]  Again, I'm not even against the people of Mexico.
[00:27:01.206 --> 00:27:01.586]  Okay?
[00:27:01.926 --> 00:27:03.828]  The fact is, the elite wants this.
[00:27:03.908 --> 00:27:05.168]  It's destroying our country.
[00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:08.070]  They treat American citizens like slaves everywhere.
[00:27:08.551 --> 00:27:13.534]  But our borders are completely wide open and the Mexican government, with our government, is going to give them GPS.
[00:27:14.681 --> 00:27:17.383]  I mean, look, under the Guest Worker Program, they're all legal to begin with.
[00:27:17.403 --> 00:27:21.065]  The Democrats are about to kick off the first session of the new Congress.
[00:27:21.505 --> 00:27:22.366]  I mean, we're in trouble.
[00:27:22.966 --> 00:27:28.589]  I mean, you know, 90% of Americans want to control our borders, including 67% of Hispanic Americans.
[00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:30.070]  What's the government's answer?
[00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:31.291]  We're going to legalize them.
[00:27:32.541 --> 00:27:34.442]  78% of Americans want us out of Iraq.
[00:27:34.502 --> 00:27:36.203]  The Democrats answer, we're going to increase.
[00:27:36.283 --> 00:27:37.724]  I mean, they're just a bunch of scum.
[00:27:38.124 --> 00:27:38.405]  Yeah.
[00:27:38.625 --> 00:27:40.246]  They're killing this country, period.
[00:27:40.766 --> 00:27:41.927]  They're killing its good name.
[00:27:42.508 --> 00:27:43.628]  They're killing its borders.
[00:27:43.668 --> 00:27:44.709]  They're killing its industry.
[00:27:44.729 --> 00:27:46.390]  It's just at every level.
[00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:47.971]  Yeah, we're going down the tubes.
[00:27:48.011 --> 00:27:48.472]  You're right.
[00:27:48.732 --> 00:27:50.153]  Hey, did you know that Arizona
[00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:57.919]  Ranks 49th in education now, and that's because all these illegal aliens are in our schools and they can't speak English.
[00:27:58.439 --> 00:28:04.703]  I thought Texas, I haven't seen the number in a couple years, it changes, but I guess you took the pole position away from Texas, huh?
[00:28:04.743 --> 00:28:10.426]  Because Texas was 49th in education, and I think West Virginia or something was the worst.
[00:28:10.766 --> 00:28:12.567]  But Texas is usually the worst.
[00:28:13.488 --> 00:28:14.448]  How dare you steal our...
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:16.600]  Yeah.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.420]  We're mental.
[00:28:17.841 --> 00:28:20.762]  We're just going down the tubes real fast.
[00:28:21.142 --> 00:28:22.603]  Hey, but that's how the elite likes it.
[00:28:22.883 --> 00:28:24.844]  Manageable peon slaves that have nothing.
[00:28:24.884 --> 00:28:25.504]  Thanks for the call.
[00:28:27.945 --> 00:28:34.888]  Well, I should have gotten more details, but I'm sure folks can do a search and find out about the illegal alien demonstration.
[00:28:36.028 --> 00:28:41.170]  Yeah, California, Utah, places like that give more tuition to illegal aliens.
[00:28:41.591 --> 00:28:42.591]  This is admitted.
[00:28:43.716 --> 00:28:44.437]  than U.S.
[00:28:44.477 --> 00:28:45.317]  citizens get.
[00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:50.701]  I mean, it's every incentive you can.
[00:28:51.782 --> 00:28:54.163]  Again, let's just separate this out.
[00:28:56.144 --> 00:29:07.132]  This is a foreign country that is a police state that has more billionaires per capita than any other nation in the world because you've got just a few families and their minions that own it.
[00:29:07.192 --> 00:29:08.993]  They have triple the resources.
[00:29:10.274 --> 00:29:10.414]  Oil.
[00:29:12.802 --> 00:29:13.342]  Nickel.
[00:29:14.722 --> 00:29:21.344]  On average, you can look it up, Mexico has triple the resources that the United States has.
[00:29:21.544 --> 00:29:22.204]  Triple.
[00:29:23.684 --> 00:29:26.065]  But their people are total slaves.
[00:29:27.385 --> 00:29:30.145]  And they're running them all off their property in the south of Mexico.
[00:29:30.165 --> 00:29:37.667]  That's how Mexico City has gone from 15 million 10 years ago to 33 million last time I checked.
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.140]  Half of them living in cardboard boxes.
[00:29:40.661 --> 00:29:42.221]  The most dangerous city in the world.
[00:29:42.641 --> 00:29:44.081]  The most toxic city in the world.
[00:29:44.861 --> 00:29:54.003]  Over a third of the newborn babies that are born in the shacks that drink out of those water systems where all of our batteries and toxic waste gets dumped.
[00:29:54.023 --> 00:29:55.043]  I'm not saying all, a lot of it.
[00:29:55.704 --> 00:29:57.884]  Have a syndrome where they don't have a brain.
[00:29:58.724 --> 00:30:00.885]  They literally only have the brain stem operating.
[00:30:00.905 --> 00:30:02.945]  So I'm against that.
[00:30:04.045 --> 00:30:05.066]  I'm against globalism.
[00:30:05.086 --> 00:30:07.326]  And I understand why these Mexicans want to come up here.
[00:30:08.912 --> 00:30:11.914]  But it's a battering ram of the New World Order.
[00:30:12.514 --> 00:30:19.278]  We need to help get a revolution in our country, get our nation back, and go down there and kick their elite out and help their revolution.
[00:30:19.658 --> 00:30:22.000]  Instead, our government gives them the weapons to kill their people.
[00:30:25.462 --> 00:30:26.382]  We're on the march.
[00:30:26.863 --> 00:30:28.464]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:29.384 --> 00:30:32.066]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:35.703 --> 00:30:39.724]  Have you ever wondered about what the Mark of the Beast is in Chapter 13 of Revelation?
[00:30:40.184 --> 00:30:42.085]  What does 666 really mean?
[00:30:42.665 --> 00:30:44.425]  Or about the Harlot Church of Revelation 17?
[00:30:45.386 --> 00:30:47.186]  Or about the Beast of Daniel in Revelation?
[00:30:47.466 --> 00:30:51.127]  Speculation abounds about these ancient prophecies and what they might mean today.
[00:30:51.427 --> 00:30:59.750]  Now, one of the foremost scholars on geopolitics and popular talk show guest, Dr. Michael Kaufman, has just released a DVD called, World Events and Prophecy.
[00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:04.251]  Dr. Michael Kaufman is recognized for his penetrating analyses of global events.
[00:31:04.591 --> 00:31:12.096]  And has used his information to almost single-handedly stop the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity from being ratified by the U.S.
[00:31:12.136 --> 00:31:15.399]  Senate, one hour before the Senate was to vote to ratify it.
[00:31:15.739 --> 00:31:21.683]  Order World Events and Prophecy now and see why those who have seen it say it is one of the best DVDs on the subject.
[00:31:21.803 --> 00:31:25.486]  Order now at discerningtoday.org or call toll-free 877-271-7639.
[00:31:25.506 --> 00:31:25.906]  That's 877-271-7639.
[00:31:26.026 --> 00:31:26.927]  Don't be caught off guard.
[00:31:37.313 --> 00:31:40.836]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:31:42.037 --> 00:31:46.860]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.802]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:31:49.842 --> 00:31:50.963]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:31:52.304 --> 00:31:56.907]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:31:57.828 --> 00:32:05.033]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:32:06.067 --> 00:32:09.488]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:32:11.289 --> 00:32:14.750]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:32:15.731 --> 00:32:16.991]  Call for your copy today.
[00:32:17.251 --> 00:32:19.452]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:32:20.512 --> 00:32:26.354]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:32:27.055 --> 00:32:27.355]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:32:27.375 --> 00:32:27.675]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:32:35.268 --> 00:32:36.149]  It's no secret.
[00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:41.913]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[00:32:42.073 --> 00:32:46.876]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[00:32:47.176 --> 00:32:49.498]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[00:32:49.678 --> 00:32:52.259]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called Novo.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:33:00.685]  Novo eliminates the bacterial growth which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration, which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[00:33:00.845 --> 00:33:05.028]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in Novo.
[00:33:05.388 --> 00:33:11.592]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil, arrowroot powder, silica, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and geranium.
[00:33:11.772 --> 00:33:15.935]  No-BO's job is to destroy the bacteria that causes the odor while soothing your skin.
[00:33:16.095 --> 00:33:20.457]  You can use No-BO under your arms, on tough foot odors, or for athlete's foot.
[00:33:20.618 --> 00:33:24.600]  No-BO is guaranteed 100% or receive a full refund.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.482]  Visit No-BO.com to order.
[00:33:27.602 --> 00:33:30.424]  That's No-BO.com or call 850-723-8599.
[00:33:37.725 --> 00:33:40.886]  We're good to go.
[00:33:58.745 --> 00:34:03.326]  It was an inside joke, very well connected.
[00:34:04.807 --> 00:34:11.009]  You're a sinner's protest, so merrily rejected.
[00:34:11.029 --> 00:34:15.750]  It was an inside joke, like it always is.
[00:34:17.091 --> 00:34:20.912]  Y'all get up, to finish this as usual.
[00:34:26.832 --> 00:34:30.233]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:34:31.293 --> 00:34:44.957]  While you were dreaming, this little island disappeared.
[00:34:45.818 --> 00:34:46.998]  While you were dreaming,
[00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:16.356]  You know, to the yuppies, to the trendies, to the bling blings out there listening, it's so alien, it's so bizarre to care about your country, to care about the future destiny of your children, to care about liberty.
[00:35:17.739 --> 00:35:19.160]  And that's why we've gotten this position.
[00:35:19.941 --> 00:35:26.506]  For a lot of people, I'd have to say 20-30% of the population, maybe more, they just don't care about anybody but themselves.
[00:35:27.346 --> 00:35:35.332]  Then you've probably got another 30 or 40% who care about others, but only the fad that the corporate media puts out.
[00:35:35.613 --> 00:35:38.615]  Then they take their well-meaning energies and use it towards evil.
[00:35:39.616 --> 00:35:44.099]  Towards tattling on their neighbors, warrantless checkpoints, getting rid of the borders.
[00:35:44.199 --> 00:35:46.321]  Oh, let's be sweet to the dear little immigrants.
[00:35:48.114 --> 00:35:49.495]  You want to be like Blade Runner, folks?
[00:35:49.535 --> 00:35:51.156]  Because there's six and a half billion people.
[00:35:51.737 --> 00:35:54.238]  There's going to be eight billion in ten years or less.
[00:35:55.799 --> 00:35:57.240]  They all want to come here.
[00:35:59.341 --> 00:36:08.267]  And if you're going to have them come here, you might as well test them for drug immune TB and leprosy and a hundred other horrible things that are spreading all over.
[00:36:11.448 --> 00:36:15.431]  I mean, I got several articles today of kids dying all over the country from meningitis.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:21.021]  And in one article it footnotes, well, yeah, it was brought in by the immigrant community.
[00:36:21.061 --> 00:36:23.261]  I mean, there's some scary stuff coming in here, folks.
[00:36:23.821 --> 00:36:31.643]  We got rid of all the big diseases and weren't... You know, when you go to the third world, you gotta be careful, you gotta watch where you eat, you gotta drink filtered water.
[00:36:32.123 --> 00:36:32.863]  There's a reason.
[00:36:32.903 --> 00:36:34.543]  They never got real sanitation.
[00:36:34.763 --> 00:36:36.223]  It's disease-filled.
[00:36:38.164 --> 00:36:46.065]  In the third world, they also sell antibiotics like candy on the store shelves, and so that's why a lot of the superbugs come from there because of that as well.
[00:36:47.725 --> 00:36:51.747]  And I just look at an article like, the Mexican and U.S.
[00:36:51.787 --> 00:37:02.452]  government are teamed up together to give 200,000 devices to border crossers, GPS, alarms.
[00:37:05.133 --> 00:37:06.533]  I mean, it's amazing.
[00:37:07.254 --> 00:37:11.436]  Again, I, when I go to the bank, have to show an I.D.
[00:37:11.636 --> 00:37:12.936]  card, three forms of I.D.
[00:37:12.956 --> 00:37:14.257]  to get a bank account or cash or check.
[00:37:15.345 --> 00:37:19.469]  It is in the Associated Press, what we already reported to you, what we couldn't believe.
[00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:23.292]  We were getting the reports of it, and they confirmed it.
[00:37:24.012 --> 00:37:25.253]  We've been telling you for two years.
[00:37:25.273 --> 00:37:26.254]  They don't have to show.
[00:37:26.274 --> 00:37:29.677]  Doesn't matter where they're from.
[00:37:31.538 --> 00:37:36.402]  You just walk up, and you tell them, I'm an immigrant, and they say, what's your name?
[00:37:36.442 --> 00:37:38.364]  And they just give you a whole new identity.
[00:37:40.986 --> 00:37:42.788]  Home loans, car loans,
[00:37:43.752 --> 00:37:44.233]  Everything.
[00:37:44.293 --> 00:37:45.053]  I mean, how?
[00:37:46.555 --> 00:37:51.079]  And again, when you come to some checkpoint and these cops walk up and want to search your car, you've got to just laugh at them.
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:56.304]  The government ships the narcotics in, controls and licenses who can bring them in.
[00:37:56.584 --> 00:37:57.485]  It's where it's admitted.
[00:37:58.325 --> 00:38:00.608]  Up one side and down the other from every angle you can imagine.
[00:38:02.349 --> 00:38:03.911]  Hundreds of whistleblowers going public.
[00:38:04.591 --> 00:38:08.535]  Hundreds of times the CIA and others have been caught shipping it in by DEA and others.
[00:38:09.662 --> 00:38:15.326]  They got the nerve to bust your door down looking for the trash their boss has brought in.
[00:38:15.787 --> 00:38:21.011]  They got the nerve to arrest you because you forgot your driver's license when you drove to the store to get some milk.
[00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:22.752]  It's happened to people I know.
[00:38:24.433 --> 00:38:26.495]  Oh, you should have had your driver's license.
[00:38:27.015 --> 00:38:29.777]  Well, if you're an illegal alien, you can do whatever you want.
[00:38:29.797 --> 00:38:32.840]  It just shows how it's all selectively enforced.
[00:38:34.019 --> 00:38:35.620]  Alright, we're going to go to your calls quickly now.
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:41.585]  I say I'm under the weather today, with a sore throat and stuff, and I'm going to go to calls and I don't.
[00:38:41.625 --> 00:38:45.447]  It's just, it's so over the top, everything that's happening.
[00:38:45.868 --> 00:38:49.290]  By the way, I started a few months ago carrying world events and prophecy.
[00:38:49.871 --> 00:38:54.154]  And it just looks at the world government, the documents, what is admitted in comparison to the Bible.
[00:38:54.194 --> 00:38:54.854]  It's pretty scary.
[00:38:55.595 --> 00:38:58.537]  Dr. Michael Kaufman started carrying that.
[00:39:00.226 --> 00:39:04.869]  And, uh, we carry that on the online video and bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[00:39:04.889 --> 00:39:07.831]  If you want to support us and get a great video, you should go do that.
[00:39:08.211 --> 00:39:10.493]  Or 9-11 Mysteries Demolitions.
[00:39:12.874 --> 00:39:13.535]  We have that.
[00:39:14.996 --> 00:39:22.921]  Or you can also get Aaron Russo's America, Freedom to Fascism, about the Federal Reserve and the private IRS and how it operates.
[00:39:23.702 --> 00:39:24.382]  Great film.
[00:39:24.402 --> 00:39:24.922]  Incredible.
[00:39:25.423 --> 00:39:27.064]  Much stronger than what you saw in theaters.
[00:39:27.104 --> 00:39:28.385]  It's even better than what was in theaters.
[00:39:28.405 --> 00:39:28.805]  It was great.
[00:39:31.321 --> 00:39:32.821]  We've got Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[00:39:32.841 --> 00:39:34.502]  We've got my new film, Terror Storm.
[00:39:34.902 --> 00:39:36.462]  The history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:39:36.582 --> 00:39:37.582]  Such an important film.
[00:39:38.182 --> 00:39:44.064]  With 68 minutes of extras on it from the 9-11 Neoconagenda Symposium last June in Los Angeles.
[00:39:44.504 --> 00:39:49.425]  With top experts exposing... I mean, it's all the highlights of a two-day conference in 68 minutes.
[00:39:50.285 --> 00:39:52.165]  It's worth 19 bucks just for that.
[00:39:53.206 --> 00:39:59.407]  You can get Terror Storm as low as $9.95 on InfoWars.com when you get it with America, Freedom to Fascism.
[00:40:00.191 --> 00:40:02.033]  We got 20-something specials up there.
[00:40:02.053 --> 00:40:03.354]  We just keep adding more and more.
[00:40:03.814 --> 00:40:06.316]  We're going to take some down soon because it's getting confusing.
[00:40:06.977 --> 00:40:08.238]  So I take advantage of those.
[00:40:08.438 --> 00:40:11.381]  And that's, by the way, how we fund this operation.
[00:40:11.401 --> 00:40:15.464]  A lot of days now I come in and I don't even plug the videos, which I should.
[00:40:16.085 --> 00:40:19.188]  That's how we make the films, do the video reports.
[00:40:19.268 --> 00:40:24.993]  I mean, I sent two guys out to the FEMA camp north of Austin two days ago.
[00:40:26.101 --> 00:40:35.444]  Paid two people all day to go out there and do that, then paid Aaron Dykes for two days work, a day and a half of work, editing the piece to upload to Google Video for free.
[00:40:37.885 --> 00:40:40.166]  That's the type of service we provide.
[00:40:40.986 --> 00:40:54.131]  When you buy Terror Storm, when you buy America Freedom to Fascism, when you buy videos like World Events and Prophecy, when you get these materials, see this is not some business where
[00:40:55.254 --> 00:40:58.016]  Our goal is to stick more money in a bank account.
[00:40:58.997 --> 00:40:59.757]  It means nothing.
[00:40:59.797 --> 00:41:01.198]  It's being devalued.
[00:41:01.298 --> 00:41:02.719]  It's like toilet paper, folks.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:04.480]  Alright?
[00:41:05.701 --> 00:41:12.906]  But you can take that toilet paper and get powerful videos, and then we will use that to put it in our tank.
[00:41:13.326 --> 00:41:17.009]  And that's what we are, is a tank to run over New World Order operations.
[00:41:17.609 --> 00:41:20.952]  Run over their soldiers and drive down in the ditches and run them over.
[00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:22.693]  That's what we do in the Info War.
[00:41:22.733 --> 00:41:24.274]  That's the analogy, or analogous.
[00:41:26.537 --> 00:41:29.579]  And we are hard working.
[00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:30.560]  We get a lot done.
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:34.222]  And if I have more support, I will hire more people.
[00:41:34.362 --> 00:41:35.483]  I will get a bigger office.
[00:41:35.603 --> 00:41:40.266]  I will do a lot more than what we're currently doing.
[00:41:40.306 --> 00:41:52.755]  So it's also important to support us and to go to InfoWars.com and to get the Everything Special or get my DVD specials or get the book specials.
[00:41:53.684 --> 00:41:55.805]  And give them as gifts, even if you know about the New World Order.
[00:41:56.385 --> 00:41:56.725]  Get them.
[00:41:56.765 --> 00:41:57.525]  Make copies.
[00:41:58.005 --> 00:41:59.286]  Give them to your friends and family.
[00:41:59.666 --> 00:42:02.747]  That's how we've come this far in this fight.
[00:42:02.767 --> 00:42:07.488]  And my passion in life is to fight the globalists.
[00:42:07.528 --> 00:42:08.969]  I mean, these are bad people, folks.
[00:42:08.989 --> 00:42:10.529]  This is about survival for me.
[00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:15.190]  That's why I'm here today when I've got a fever and I'm sick.
[00:42:18.691 --> 00:42:20.152]  Because I have a passion
[00:42:21.232 --> 00:42:22.933]  I mean, why would you not have a passion?
[00:42:22.953 --> 00:42:24.974]  I mean, these are really bad people.
[00:42:26.874 --> 00:42:36.699]  I've got BBC, London Telegraph, you name it, today, where the UN's running child slavery and child bordellos, pedophile rings.
[00:42:36.719 --> 00:42:38.539]  I mean, gee, every day there's articles.
[00:42:38.559 --> 00:42:39.260]  I mean, every day!
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:40.760]  That's all they do.
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:43.882]  I mean, how could we not want to expose them?
[00:42:43.922 --> 00:42:45.142]  I mean, this is bad.
[00:42:45.942 --> 00:42:47.083]  I have empathy, folks.
[00:42:48.789 --> 00:42:51.711]  And see, in the yuppie world, empathy is seen as weakness.
[00:42:53.253 --> 00:43:01.999]  In the trendy world, you just care about yourself, you just make a lot of money, and you have lots of fancy shoes and computers, and you go on the best trips.
[00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:05.262]  I just want to beat your brains out when I see you.
[00:43:06.222 --> 00:43:08.584]  I see you out there and you don't care about this country.
[00:43:09.305 --> 00:43:09.825]  I do.
[00:43:09.905 --> 00:43:11.246]  I just want to knock your teeth out.
[00:43:12.327 --> 00:43:13.908]  I mean, that's really how I feel about you.
[00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:16.670]  I do.
[00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:17.531]  I want to hurt you.
[00:43:19.195 --> 00:43:22.616]  Because if you people cared, and you stood up, we could save this country.
[00:43:24.077 --> 00:43:25.818]  And, you know, I know the New World Order is evil.
[00:43:25.858 --> 00:43:26.878]  I know what they're all about.
[00:43:27.538 --> 00:43:28.539]  And I respect them.
[00:43:28.619 --> 00:43:29.139]  I hate them.
[00:43:29.919 --> 00:43:30.580]  I love them.
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:34.041]  But, in a way, it's even more nauseating.
[00:43:34.881 --> 00:43:35.662]  The Bible says that.
[00:43:35.682 --> 00:43:36.722]  You're either hot or cold.
[00:43:36.802 --> 00:43:37.823]  I spit you out of my mouth.
[00:43:38.523 --> 00:43:46.586]  These fence-sitters, and people that sit around and send me little emails making jokes, and, oh, you're making this stuff up, or you're a kook, or you're nuts.
[00:43:46.866 --> 00:43:47.266]  You know what?
[00:43:47.327 --> 00:43:48.307]  I wish I was a kook.
[00:43:49.366 --> 00:43:50.987]  I wish to God this wasn't real.
[00:43:55.729 --> 00:43:57.951]  I wish I was making all this up.
[00:43:59.732 --> 00:44:00.972]  Because we don't have a future.
[00:44:01.773 --> 00:44:02.233]  We don't.
[00:44:02.513 --> 00:44:03.494]  These are bad people.
[00:44:07.676 --> 00:44:10.577]  I happen to care about Mexican children down in Mexico City.
[00:44:13.539 --> 00:44:17.061]  Living in the hell that makes the jungle
[00:44:18.434 --> 00:44:20.016]  The book written about the U.S.
[00:44:20.356 --> 00:44:26.802]  in the Industrial Revolution, late 1800s, early 1900s, looked like a tea party.
[00:44:29.925 --> 00:44:34.250]  I happen to care deeply about all the families
[00:44:35.794 --> 00:44:38.275]  From Austin to Chicago, from L.A.
[00:44:38.315 --> 00:44:44.577]  to New York, right now, that have CPS grabbing women around the throat with police telling them to sign documents, signing their children over.
[00:44:44.937 --> 00:44:45.537]  I've seen it.
[00:44:45.677 --> 00:44:48.338]  I've wept when I've left the hospital covering these things.
[00:44:51.219 --> 00:44:52.280]  I have empathy.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.720]  And you know why I have empathy?
[00:44:56.221 --> 00:45:00.122]  Because mammals have empathy so we don't tear each other apart.
[00:45:01.683 --> 00:45:02.603]  We are predators.
[00:45:02.643 --> 00:45:03.463]  We are intelligent.
[00:45:03.503 --> 00:45:04.384]  We are dynamic.
[00:45:04.424 --> 00:45:05.204]  We are powerful.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:11.261]  And if we don't have love, we tear each other apart.
[00:45:13.001 --> 00:45:18.082]  And if we don't have empathy, we wouldn't have souls.
[00:45:21.803 --> 00:45:28.324]  And I don't know how people can say, I'm just living my life.
[00:45:28.364 --> 00:45:30.105]  The world's always been a bad place.
[00:45:31.065 --> 00:45:32.205]  That's just the way it is.
[00:45:33.394 --> 00:45:35.075]  You know, I'm getting mine.
[00:45:35.215 --> 00:45:36.156]  What are you getting?
[00:45:36.296 --> 00:45:37.456]  Plates of food?
[00:45:38.357 --> 00:45:38.837]  Sex?
[00:45:40.298 --> 00:45:42.019]  I mean, I'm not against people that like cars.
[00:45:42.039 --> 00:45:46.161]  I'm not saying owning things is bad, but if that's your God, it's bad.
[00:45:47.582 --> 00:45:51.905]  You know, people who care and just constantly care what everybody thinks about them.
[00:45:53.226 --> 00:45:54.386]  I just don't understand that.
[00:45:54.586 --> 00:45:59.009]  I don't want to get off on some preacher's binge here.
[00:46:03.001 --> 00:46:04.862]  Take what's happening with the Democrats.
[00:46:05.623 --> 00:46:09.826]  I mean, is there any illustration that could be better of what trash they are?
[00:46:12.287 --> 00:46:23.835]  I mean, a bunch of festooned women dressed up in their $3,000 dresses with their brooches on power trips running around scheming to get more control.
[00:46:25.356 --> 00:46:31.540]  That political prostitute Nancy Pelosi with her restaurant chains and all the rest of it.
[00:46:32.387 --> 00:46:35.969]  Running around, and you've got all of those Republicans.
[00:46:35.989 --> 00:46:39.612]  I mean, you ought to watch the Texas Legislature when it's on TV.
[00:46:39.632 --> 00:46:41.153]  They even look worse than Congress.
[00:46:41.193 --> 00:46:44.194]  It's like all these people in these fancy suits with these fake smiles.
[00:46:44.715 --> 00:46:46.376]  You see them, they're all posturing.
[00:46:47.236 --> 00:46:50.758]  The men are trying to look manly, but they all look real effeminate.
[00:46:51.819 --> 00:46:55.181]  And you just want to... You just, oh yeah.
[00:46:56.842 --> 00:46:57.723]  I'm just sick of them.
[00:46:58.003 --> 00:46:59.484]  I'm sick of scum.
[00:47:01.897 --> 00:47:02.658]  I'm sick of you.
[00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:11.265]  A bunch of scum, paid off, selling everything out, looting everything with their pinky rings and their cuff links.
[00:47:11.305 --> 00:47:14.727]  They're not even real people.
[00:47:14.747 --> 00:47:16.549]  Their whole lives are just make-believe.
[00:47:16.629 --> 00:47:19.331]  It's just this image of themselves.
[00:47:19.651 --> 00:47:23.555]  It's like when you're five and you dress up like a policeman and play the part of a policeman.
[00:47:25.036 --> 00:47:28.559]  They just play the part of powerful people.
[00:47:31.203 --> 00:47:31.703]  I think so.
[00:47:51.031 --> 00:47:54.294]  All those Democrats that were sitting on the fence and criticizing me.
[00:47:54.354 --> 00:47:56.195]  Don't say they're going to be traitors when they get in.
[00:47:56.215 --> 00:47:57.676]  They aren't.
[00:47:57.696 --> 00:47:58.617]  They'll impeach him.
[00:47:59.057 --> 00:48:02.100]  They're just strategizing right now to get elected.
[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:03.501]  Oh, you wait.
[00:48:04.101 --> 00:48:06.783]  Once they get in, they're going to get us out of Iraq.
[00:48:07.904 --> 00:48:09.685]  I'm not going to listen to you anymore.
[00:48:10.106 --> 00:48:12.407]  And I'm not going to visit your website anymore.
[00:48:12.427 --> 00:48:14.929]  Well, now you're emailing back apologizing.
[00:48:14.969 --> 00:48:16.531]  I don't care about you apologizing to me.
[00:48:16.551 --> 00:48:18.372]  I don't need the ego trip of you being wrong.
[00:48:18.432 --> 00:48:19.413]  I wish you would be right.
[00:48:20.888 --> 00:48:30.834]  We have to admit how bad things are first before we can set about fixing them.
[00:48:30.914 --> 00:48:31.234]  Okay?
[00:48:32.695 --> 00:48:35.677]  We are bought and paid for by international crime syndicates.
[00:48:37.958 --> 00:48:38.418]  Period.
[00:48:40.159 --> 00:48:42.801]  And they don't care about you and your children and your future.
[00:48:42.841 --> 00:48:45.762]  In fact, it's the opposite.
[00:48:47.904 --> 00:48:49.905]  They want to extinct any
[00:48:51.031 --> 00:48:52.891]  One who can stand on their own two feet.
[00:48:52.931 --> 00:48:54.532]  They want to destroy the middle class.
[00:48:55.092 --> 00:48:56.732]  They openly want to destroy the family.
[00:48:57.812 --> 00:48:59.513]  And they've done one hell of a job.
[00:49:01.153 --> 00:49:02.333]  What was illegitimacy?
[00:49:02.413 --> 00:49:04.933]  It was like 5-6% 60-something years ago.
[00:49:06.854 --> 00:49:15.935]  Now illegitimacy has passed over the halfway point in the white population and is 90 plus percent in the black population.
[00:49:17.656 --> 00:49:19.376]  They're even cracking the Hispanics who
[00:49:20.922 --> 00:49:23.425]  At very low illegitimacy, family is very important.
[00:49:23.445 --> 00:49:24.886]  They're even busting them up right now.
[00:49:24.906 --> 00:49:26.888]  What are they, like 27% illegitimacy?
[00:49:28.509 --> 00:49:30.031]  I mean, this is systematic.
[00:49:31.292 --> 00:49:33.154]  This is ruining children's lives.
[00:49:34.115 --> 00:49:38.799]  And I just can't watch George Bush, who was involved in the 9-11 attacks, who killed all those people.
[00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:43.904]  I can't watch him up there on TV posing as our savior anymore.
[00:49:45.513 --> 00:49:47.294]  I don't want to watch George Bush Senior.
[00:49:47.334 --> 00:49:48.974]  I don't want to see David Rockefeller.
[00:49:49.614 --> 00:49:56.196]  I don't want to look at any of the Henry Kissinger, John Negroponte, just all these people.
[00:49:56.276 --> 00:49:58.297]  I mean, these are bad people.
[00:50:00.418 --> 00:50:04.719]  These are very, very, very bad people.
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.780]  They like what they do.
[00:50:11.581 --> 00:50:13.622]  They like the fact
[00:50:14.324 --> 00:50:15.105]  That the U.N.
[00:50:15.485 --> 00:50:21.149]  in the third world is really a giant global prostitution trade worth hundreds of billions a year.
[00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:31.957]  They go to bed and like the power of knowing that they own and control the snuff film industry.
[00:50:32.337 --> 00:50:37.401]  They like blowing children's heads off with handguns.
[00:50:38.482 --> 00:50:38.782]  Okay?
[00:50:40.203 --> 00:50:41.484]  That's who we're talking about here.
[00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:42.850]  Do you understand?
[00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:47.672]  People much more evil than Jeffrey Dahmer run our country.
[00:50:48.193 --> 00:50:49.233]  They're so powerful.
[00:50:49.253 --> 00:50:50.233]  They're so bored.
[00:50:50.754 --> 00:50:56.596]  They're so decadent that they do evil because it's their sacrament.
[00:50:56.616 --> 00:50:59.177]  All right, I promise.
[00:50:59.357 --> 00:51:00.938]  Our guest is actually on in the third hour.
[00:51:01.898 --> 00:51:08.441]  But I will go to Jerry and Joe and Jim and Bill and Joe and everybody else when we get back.
[00:51:09.502 --> 00:51:09.942]  I'm done.
[00:51:12.325 --> 00:51:14.067]  And it's not negative, what I'm doing here.
[00:51:14.167 --> 00:51:15.048]  I'm being positive.
[00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:21.495]  It's positive to admit just how evil these people are.
[00:51:23.378 --> 00:51:25.980]  It's positive to face the truth.
[00:51:26.861 --> 00:51:33.209]  And I want all the government workers to know you work for a system that runs the evil.
[00:51:38.189 --> 00:51:38.689]  It's here.
[00:51:38.889 --> 00:51:43.651]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:44.031 --> 00:51:51.674]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:52.364 --> 00:51:59.406]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:59.806 --> 00:52:11.229]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.

[00:54:45.435 --> 00:54:46.995]  Let's go to your calls.
[00:54:47.275 --> 00:54:51.376]  Let's talk to Jerry in Washington State and Joe, Jim, Bill, Joe and others.
[00:54:51.756 --> 00:54:52.056]  Welcome.
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:53.460]  Alex.
[00:54:53.801 --> 00:54:54.121]  Yes, sir.
[00:54:54.241 --> 00:54:55.402]  I'm sorry you're not feeling well.
[00:54:55.422 --> 00:54:56.202]  I really am sorry.
[00:54:56.362 --> 00:54:59.565]  Hey, I feel better being on the radio than laying in bed.
[00:55:00.005 --> 00:55:02.147]  I tell you what, get yourself some colloidal silver.
[00:55:02.247 --> 00:55:03.448]  I kind of stick with that myself.
[00:55:03.548 --> 00:55:04.849]  You know, I've got one of those generators.
[00:55:04.869 --> 00:55:05.429]  I need to do that.
[00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:06.370]  Yeah, you do.
[00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:07.571]  Get on it right away.
[00:55:08.091 --> 00:55:13.175]  But anyway, the reason I'm calling was about Shirley Anderson, who called yesterday afternoon or yesterday morning.
[00:55:13.775 --> 00:55:14.416]  Do you remember there?
[00:55:14.916 --> 00:55:16.037]  Yeah, I had her on as a guest.
[00:55:16.357 --> 00:55:16.938]  That's correct.
[00:55:17.378 --> 00:55:19.860]  She was asking for help, and I'm willing to help.
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:21.541]  Now, she's listening.
[00:55:22.202 --> 00:55:27.443]  Uh, I need for, uh, between you and I, uh, off air, we'll find a way to, uh, have her contact me.
[00:55:27.963 --> 00:55:29.284]  What do you live near that town?
[00:55:29.724 --> 00:55:32.284]  I live 60 miles south, in Spokane.
[00:55:33.444 --> 00:55:35.745]  Well, we got her phone number posted on the website.
[00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:37.605]  We posted it at jonesreport.com.
[00:55:37.665 --> 00:55:39.026]  I mean, she wrote a letter to the editor.
[00:55:39.046 --> 00:55:42.927]  I went, uh, to your site yesterday, and I looked, and I couldn't find it.
[00:55:42.987 --> 00:55:43.927]  I did see your letter.
[00:55:44.087 --> 00:55:46.847]  You know, they told me they put it up, and I was having, uh, uh, trouble.
[00:55:47.127 --> 00:55:49.428]  Oh, your signal letter is up, but you couldn't see the number.
[00:55:49.952 --> 00:55:50.292]  Correct.
[00:55:50.732 --> 00:55:52.633]  Okay, we'll make sure the number's added back into there.
[00:55:53.334 --> 00:55:54.734]  Okay, for yesterday's show?
[00:55:55.375 --> 00:55:55.575]  Yes.
[00:55:55.635 --> 00:55:56.315]  Backtrack a day?
[00:55:59.136 --> 00:56:01.838]  Yeah, I'm saying I'll have them add the phone number up there for you.
[00:56:02.798 --> 00:56:03.078]  Great.
[00:56:04.099 --> 00:56:05.719]  She was looking for help.
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:06.820]  I have an attorney.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:08.561]  I'll tell you something that's funny.
[00:56:08.721 --> 00:56:15.684]  This attorney I spoke with, the police officer that brutalized her, this attorney knows of this man.
[00:56:15.884 --> 00:56:17.485]  His name is Scott Arms, the police officer.
[00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:19.282]  This attorney knows of him.
[00:56:19.362 --> 00:56:22.004]  He does have a reputation of being not a good man.
[00:56:23.165 --> 00:56:23.525]  Really?
[00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:26.488]  So you contacted a local lawyer for her?
[00:56:26.888 --> 00:56:27.068]  Yes.
[00:56:27.549 --> 00:56:28.089]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:56:28.109 --> 00:56:28.830]  Let me put you on hold.
[00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:37.457]  I'll give your number to one of my people and then we'll put you in contact with her and I'll make sure her number gets added back into that press release that she put out.
[00:56:37.497 --> 00:56:38.598]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:56:38.638 --> 00:56:39.178]  That's great.
[00:56:39.739 --> 00:56:40.099]  Thank you.
[00:56:41.195 --> 00:56:48.218]  Yeah, she wrote a letter to the editor and then tried to give them some Terror Storm and other videos of the library, and they decided that was illegal.
[00:56:49.759 --> 00:56:55.441]  So they came and knocked down her door without a warrant, beat her up, and are charging her with assaulting them.
[00:56:56.842 --> 00:56:59.283]  I tell you, good old U.S.S.R.A.
[00:57:00.403 --> 00:57:02.644]  Let's talk to Joe.
[00:57:02.664 --> 00:57:05.045]  And Joe, where are you calling us from?
[00:57:09.986 --> 00:57:11.087]  Okay, we'll let him go.
[00:57:11.727 --> 00:57:13.408]  Let's talk to Jim in D.C.
[00:57:13.468 --> 00:57:14.308]  Jim, you're on the air.
[00:57:14.328 --> 00:57:14.728]  Go ahead.
[00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:16.529]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:57:16.649 --> 00:57:16.970]  Good, sir.
[00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:22.412]  Actually, I'd just like to know, I'm kind of a new listener to your program.
[00:57:22.492 --> 00:57:25.334]  Actually, the Charlie Sheen thing kind of brought me over.
[00:57:25.354 --> 00:57:31.457]  I was wanting to know what exactly you think will happen once they issue these I.D.
[00:57:31.497 --> 00:57:31.877]  cards.
[00:57:31.917 --> 00:57:35.719]  Will you have to give up your driver's license or what?
[00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:37.750]  I don't know, sir.
[00:57:38.351 --> 00:57:39.831]  They're very slick, okay?
[00:57:40.731 --> 00:57:52.495]  You know how in the Coca-Cola bottling company, say, if you live in a populous state, the cans might say Texas or New York on them, so it's brand-specific to your region?
[00:57:53.395 --> 00:57:57.296]  Under the National ID Card, your driver's license is the National ID Card.
[00:57:57.796 --> 00:58:00.797]  It's federally standardized and hooked into a federal database.
[00:58:02.497 --> 00:58:03.838]  So, five years from now,
[00:58:05.706 --> 00:58:12.809]  You know, many years after it's implemented, it's already been implemented, you'll still be having arguments with people about, I ain't got no national ID card!
[00:58:16.031 --> 00:58:16.891]  So do you see what I'm saying?
[00:58:16.911 --> 00:58:18.172]  Yeah.
[00:58:18.312 --> 00:58:32.579]  If you're looking for them in 2008 with the Real ID Act that was passed in 2005 that all 50 states haven't implemented, number one, they pass laws and then put a two or three year number on it to make everybody think, oh, it's not that bad, it's coming.
[00:58:34.608 --> 00:58:37.729]  Every state has had this implemented for at least two years.
[00:58:38.689 --> 00:58:39.070]  Okay.
[00:58:39.830 --> 00:58:43.551]  And what's this March 2008 vote law that's coming into?
[00:58:44.071 --> 00:58:54.195]  That's just some wording they put in saying that the states have to be standardized when Texas already had been standardized in 1993.
[00:58:54.255 --> 00:58:54.375]  Wow.
[00:58:59.244 --> 00:59:01.966]  Look, maybe I'm not being clear.
[00:59:01.986 --> 00:59:02.686]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[00:59:03.226 --> 00:59:03.907]  Yeah, I understand.
[00:59:04.267 --> 00:59:07.709]  It's like they say, oh, a North American Union might be coming.
[00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.850]  We're already in it.
[00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:11.471]  Or, we may put cameras up.
[00:59:11.511 --> 00:59:12.632]  The cameras have already been up.
[00:59:15.093 --> 00:59:19.016]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:59:19.336 --> 00:59:20.136]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.160]  Can we stop?
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.021]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[00:59:29.441 --> 00:59:29.681]  What?
[00:59:30.061 --> 00:59:30.401]  Again?
[00:59:30.821 --> 00:59:32.442]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[00:59:32.522 --> 00:59:33.522]  Honey, let's stop.
[00:59:33.822 --> 00:59:36.963]  Because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[00:59:37.183 --> 00:59:38.464]  Why did you do that?
[00:59:38.684 --> 00:59:40.964]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time.
[00:59:41.104 --> 00:59:44.465]  And that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[00:59:44.766 --> 00:59:45.786]  Are we there yet?
[00:59:45.906 --> 00:59:46.966]  For the entire trip.
[00:59:47.226 --> 00:59:47.566]  Hmm.
[00:59:48.147 --> 00:59:49.367]  I didn't think about that.
[00:59:49.887 --> 00:59:50.888]  Great idea!
[00:59:51.188 --> 00:59:53.810]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids!
[00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:58.252]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle and 2.5 cents per refill.
[00:59:58.513 --> 00:59:58.833]  Honey!
[00:59:59.645 --> 01:00:00.906]  You're terrific!
[01:00:01.287 --> 01:00:02.788]  Oh honey, so are you!
[01:00:02.888 --> 01:00:06.312]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[01:00:06.592 --> 01:00:07.373]  Now can we stop?
[01:00:07.873 --> 01:00:08.594]  I need to go too.
[01:00:08.894 --> 01:00:13.359]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:00:24.736 --> 01:00:26.637]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:27.117 --> 01:00:30.039]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:36.643 --> 01:00:37.303]  Big Brother.
[01:00:37.964 --> 01:00:39.024]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:39.725 --> 01:00:41.466]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:41.506 --> 01:00:42.306]  You want answers?
[01:00:43.067 --> 01:00:44.007]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:44.648 --> 01:00:48.570]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:48.810 --> 01:00:52.893]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:55.373 --> 01:00:59.297]  Really corrupt global corporations have gotten together and bought off our governments.
[01:01:00.217 --> 01:01:04.141]  And now they're passing laws to take everything you've got from your pension funds to your children.
[01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:08.725]  From the National Draft to the end of our sovereignty as a nation.
[01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:12.048]  Wide open phones in this second hour.
[01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:13.889]  I've also got a bunch of news I will go over.
[01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:15.331]  We have a big guest.
[01:01:15.551 --> 01:01:17.392]  Destroying World Order is his book.
[01:01:19.554 --> 01:01:21.196]  And he's Francis A. Boyle.
[01:01:21.236 --> 01:01:22.357]  We had him on a few weeks ago.
[01:01:23.115 --> 01:01:24.836]  He wrote our biological weapons treaty.
[01:01:25.056 --> 01:01:26.637]  He's a big muckety muck, Dr. Boyle.
[01:01:27.837 --> 01:01:32.580]  He'll be talking about how we need to impeach Bush and destroy the New World Order.
[01:01:34.881 --> 01:01:37.963]  But folks at your PTA meeting will tell you there's no New World Order.
[01:01:38.243 --> 01:01:41.184]  They're just announcing it on television, but again, it doesn't exist.
[01:01:41.525 --> 01:01:42.885]  Your church will say it's of the devil.
[01:01:43.305 --> 01:01:45.827]  Lay down to it, the world leader is Jesus.
[01:01:46.767 --> 01:01:48.568]  Take the markets of the Lord.
[01:01:49.189 --> 01:01:51.910]  They've basically gotten to that point now, Pat Robinson and others.
[01:01:52.922 --> 01:01:55.083]  Oh, I think microchips are fine.
[01:01:55.644 --> 01:01:59.145]  I think a thumbprint to do this or that's just wonderful.
[01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:07.470]  You know, the last caller was asking me a question about, uh, well wait, I hear they're going to issue national ID cards in 2008.
[01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:09.330]  How's this going to happen?
[01:02:09.691 --> 01:02:11.251]  Well, you have to turn in your license and get one.
[01:02:11.271 --> 01:02:14.093]  And I was explaining, they've already implemented it.
[01:02:14.173 --> 01:02:15.113]  It's already in place.
[01:02:15.173 --> 01:02:16.114]  It's your driver's license.
[01:02:17.268 --> 01:02:20.350]  It's federally standardized, hooked into the federal data mix.
[01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:21.631]  It is a national ID card.
[01:02:21.651 --> 01:02:24.813]  It just has your local state as its brand.
[01:02:26.555 --> 01:02:27.475]  It's its sector.
[01:02:29.357 --> 01:02:31.298]  And a lot of people are having trouble grasping this.
[01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:32.639]  I don't know, I don't understand why.
[01:02:32.659 --> 01:02:35.041]  And they go, okay, well then what's the law that's in 08?
[01:02:35.701 --> 01:02:40.004]  It just says it's the law in 08, and that you've got to have one of these.
[01:02:42.085 --> 01:02:45.408]  But for all intents and purposes, you already have to, and they've already put it in place.
[01:02:46.957 --> 01:02:49.920]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Bill.
[01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:52.663]  Bill, where are you calling us from today?
[01:02:52.843 --> 01:02:55.626]  Hey Alex, I'm calling from beautiful southern Wisconsin.
[01:02:55.666 --> 01:02:56.266]  How are you doing?
[01:02:56.326 --> 01:02:56.747]  Good, sir.
[01:02:56.767 --> 01:02:57.127]  Welcome.
[01:02:57.487 --> 01:03:04.214]  Hey, I just wondered if you had to show your national ID card to get sued for your cold.
[01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:10.220]  Yes, first it started as the corporations were doing it to work with police.
[01:03:11.019 --> 01:03:22.405]  And then now it's not just Sudafed, it's hundreds of different things, and now things that don't even have the stuff that could be turned into methamphetamine, now it's just everything they want your ID card.
[01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:26.227]  And then now they're carting, you know, 70-year-old women from cigarettes.
[01:03:26.287 --> 01:03:32.430]  It's all about getting you ready to swipe that driver's license, that national ID card with the national sales tax.
[01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:37.052]  Yeah, they're just kind of starting to do that with cigarette purchases here in Wisconsin.
[01:03:37.392 --> 01:03:38.353]  I had a couple comments.
[01:03:38.413 --> 01:03:40.514]  First, I wanted to thank you for providing
[01:03:41.554 --> 01:03:46.638]  DVD copies or making them freely available to copy.
[01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:52.002]  I've been working locally to go against globally here and making copies of Terror Storm.
[01:03:52.622 --> 01:04:04.151]  I'd like to also thank your network GCN for streaming on the internet because we don't have any affiliates nearby within earshot on AM band.
[01:04:05.187 --> 01:04:07.528]  I think the closest one is your new affiliate in Chicago.
[01:04:08.609 --> 01:04:09.709]  We can't pick them up, so.
[01:04:10.189 --> 01:04:16.772]  GCN is providing a great service, streaming you all day and all night and all weekend long, so people should check that out.
[01:04:17.492 --> 01:04:20.493]  I use a program on the PC to record your show.
[01:04:20.533 --> 01:04:29.797]  I know you offer an iPod link on your website, but I use a Windows program called Screamer Radio that I can record your streams and play them on my MP3 player.
[01:04:30.638 --> 01:04:33.899]  The other thing, I just made some quick notes and I'll be quick.
[01:04:34.612 --> 01:04:38.535]  I wonder, you had your video team out there at that FEMA camp.
[01:04:39.516 --> 01:04:42.799]  I wonder if we can get a press kit.
[01:04:42.919 --> 01:04:47.262]  You have the largest website, bigger than Rush Limbaugh's as an alternative media.
[01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:57.631]  I wonder if we could all become media press members and have cameras in their faces if you offered some kind of press pass that we could flash at these creeps.
[01:04:59.012 --> 01:05:01.674]  I actually did that about five, six, seven years ago.
[01:05:02.637 --> 01:05:08.120]  The problem is that there's a certain liability associated with it for me.
[01:05:08.141 --> 01:05:18.467]  See, all the infiltrator would have to do is get a press pass from me and then claim they were working for me and then do something that could then cause a litigious action.
[01:05:19.347 --> 01:05:23.050]  Stay there, let's splash this out on the other side.
[01:05:35.336 --> 01:05:40.743]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:41.143 --> 01:05:48.793]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:56.503]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:56.923 --> 01:06:08.328]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:06:08.648 --> 01:06:12.170]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:14.551]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:06:14.871 --> 01:06:18.713]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:06:19.314 --> 01:06:26.327]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:06:32.233 --> 01:06:35.116]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:06:35.476 --> 01:06:38.338]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:06:38.579 --> 01:06:44.764]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:06:45.144 --> 01:06:52.450]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:06:52.650 --> 01:06:56.734]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[01:06:56.994 --> 01:07:02.535]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[01:07:02.735 --> 01:07:15.858]  Complete with over three gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[01:07:16.038 --> 01:07:24.340]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Food and Places USA now for only $29, plus shipping and handling, by calling New Millennium
[01:07:28.242 --> 01:07:33.486]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[01:07:33.806 --> 01:07:42.391]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[01:07:42.771 --> 01:07:48.495]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[01:07:48.875 --> 01:07:56.322]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[01:07:56.643 --> 01:08:02.008]  Davis Products is offering high-quality, solid-cast aluminum memorial markers for your American flag.
[01:08:02.308 --> 01:08:06.232]  Each memorial marker is specifically designed to represent one of 15 wars.
[01:08:06.552 --> 01:08:12.758]  All markers include a three-eighths inch pointed and threaded aluminum rod, painted and highlighted for an appearance that is unforgettable.
[01:08:13.038 --> 01:08:15.779]  What better way to pay homage to our enlisted loved ones?
[01:08:16.079 --> 01:08:21.920]  Davis Products Memorial Markers are only nine dollars a piece and can be ordered by calling 814-827-4946.

[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:28.601]  Or visit Davis-Products.com.
[01:08:28.761 --> 01:08:30.981]  That's Davis-Products.com.
[01:08:31.922 --> 01:08:36.982]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:37.343 --> 01:08:39.603]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:45.813 --> 01:08:52.579]  It's a really great idea that the caller was raising and should have been brought forward before.
[01:08:52.999 --> 01:08:53.499]  We've done it.
[01:08:56.161 --> 01:09:06.630]  Yeah, folks, if you want to go out and shoot video, and you want to go out and do news reports, and you want to send them to us, we'll upload them to prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:09:08.531 --> 01:09:10.713]  And in the future, I'm going to have a system
[01:09:12.586 --> 01:09:13.567]  We're working on it now.
[01:09:14.828 --> 01:09:16.429]  It should be ready in about 10,000 years.
[01:09:16.509 --> 01:09:18.251]  I'm joking.
[01:09:18.391 --> 01:09:30.703]  To really bring all the alternative media, not so much together, but just a platform to get information out to people in one place.
[01:09:32.245 --> 01:09:35.508]  To mirror a lot of things that are already out there, but bring it all together in one place.
[01:09:37.319 --> 01:09:38.020]  Yes, sir.
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.501]  I have a few more items.
[01:09:39.541 --> 01:09:42.543]  I would suggest you call your vision terror tube.
[01:09:57.734 --> 01:10:05.221]  You could offer a bandwidth and space for people to upload these, you know, these rogue cops pulling people over.
[01:10:05.241 --> 01:10:06.322]  TerrorTube!
[01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:09.165]  Yeah, you could patent that from Bill in Wisconsin.
[01:10:09.625 --> 01:10:14.189]  Oh, people will grab it all up right now, and I probably wouldn't use that term, but... Okay, we've got a name.
[01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:15.691]  I've got a couple of quick more things.
[01:10:16.071 --> 01:10:17.032]  Judge Pelicano.
[01:10:17.172 --> 01:10:17.893]  Get him back.
[01:10:19.394 --> 01:10:23.438]  I would suggest also that maybe he could be the front man for perhaps
[01:10:24.048 --> 01:10:33.612]  Funding with his book, Revenues, a legal fund that you would provide to people, you know, that are getting scarped, sued by CPS or what have you.
[01:10:33.632 --> 01:10:35.313]  Yeah, but we could have billions of dollars.
[01:10:35.373 --> 01:10:38.114]  It would be, it would be exhausted in a matter of years.
[01:10:38.214 --> 01:10:40.295]  I mean, you can't do it all, man.
[01:10:40.315 --> 01:10:47.518]  You can't run a giant news system and you can't protect everybody from the CPS and you can't, you know, and I appreciate your call.
[01:10:47.638 --> 01:10:51.560]  I mean, I understand you want to help people, but everybody thinks that I somehow
[01:10:52.978 --> 01:10:54.419]  I mean, I can barely even do this show today.
[01:10:54.459 --> 01:10:57.100]  I'm sick, but I'm in here doing it because I don't want to miss a show.
[01:10:57.121 --> 01:11:01.163]  My wife just called earlier and said, you need to go to rebroadcast.
[01:11:01.183 --> 01:11:03.584]  You sound like garbage.
[01:11:06.326 --> 01:11:08.787]  I got an important guest on in the next hour and I want you to be able to hear him.
[01:11:11.049 --> 01:11:15.812]  Let's go ahead and listen, I'm not pooh-poohing what you were saying, caller.
[01:11:16.392 --> 01:11:21.495]  I'm just saying, man, Judge Napolitano from his book sales could fund a
[01:11:22.145 --> 01:11:25.306]  That guy probably makes maybe a few hundred thousand dollars off a hit book.
[01:11:28.128 --> 01:11:30.169]  That doesn't buy very much.
[01:11:30.309 --> 01:11:36.111]  Again, it's all of us individually out doing things.
[01:11:37.372 --> 01:11:49.157]  Like more important than Alex Jones building some apparatchik to post everybody's videos when that already exists, I go out and we shoot the video and we make productions for you.
[01:11:50.931 --> 01:11:53.132]  Productions we sell, productions we give away.
[01:11:54.953 --> 01:11:55.893]  We try to balance it.
[01:11:56.133 --> 01:11:57.094]  It's a Catch-22.
[01:11:59.135 --> 01:12:02.216]  But, you know, let's say I had some YouTube website.
[01:12:02.736 --> 01:12:05.677]  It wouldn't be anything without you going out and getting content.
[01:12:08.799 --> 01:12:11.080]  Alright, let's go ahead and
[01:12:14.346 --> 01:12:16.908]  Talk to Joe in New York.
[01:12:16.948 --> 01:12:17.548]  You're on the air.
[01:12:17.608 --> 01:12:18.529]  Welcome.
[01:12:18.549 --> 01:12:19.049]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:12:19.089 --> 01:12:19.930]  What a great tie-in.
[01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:25.693]  The reason I'm calling is I have a little method I use to help spread the word, and I'm thinking if everybody else does this, we could reach tons of people.
[01:12:26.934 --> 01:12:29.476]  I have a lot of family and friends that don't want to hear about the New World Order.
[01:12:29.496 --> 01:12:33.358]  They think I'm crazy, but they spend all their time sending out these little email stories.
[01:12:33.398 --> 01:12:34.759]  The government's corrupt!
[01:12:34.819 --> 01:12:35.159]  Ha ha!
[01:12:35.199 --> 01:12:36.100]  He's crazy!
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.681]  Yeah, the government wouldn't do that to us.
[01:12:38.553 --> 01:12:45.858]  So, so they send out all these little cute stories and little poems and things on the email, and I just used to delete them because it was a waste of time, but now I use them to my advantage.
[01:12:46.458 --> 01:12:52.362]  Um, for instance, the last one that came across was a little poem about this girl who, uh, her daddy died in a roadside bomb.
[01:12:52.382 --> 01:13:01.028]  It was just pure propaganda for the war, but, um, it was bigger day than school day, and she showed up alone, and she went and stood up in front of the class and told why her daddy wasn't there.
[01:13:01.448 --> 01:13:07.873]  So I changed it to say that her daddy died when the government blew up his office in the new World Trade, in the World Trade Center on 9-11.
[01:13:08.753 --> 01:13:13.794]  And then at the end of the emails it says, you know, pass your sign to ten people and get good luck and all this.
[01:13:13.814 --> 01:13:18.595]  So I changed the ending to say, go visit Infowars.com and receive good luck.
[01:13:18.735 --> 01:13:20.935]  Or go to Google Video and watch the show.
[01:13:20.995 --> 01:13:24.296]  By the way, a lot of that pro-war stuff is sitcom.
[01:13:24.716 --> 01:13:29.277]  Oh, here's a great story of how the great warriors die and how it's a great sacrifice.
[01:13:29.677 --> 01:13:31.437]  Pass it on and get good luck.
[01:13:31.838 --> 01:13:33.898]  Now pass it on and be part of propaganda.
[01:13:34.498 --> 01:13:41.601]  I mean, and they admit, folks, SimCom is all over the web, and they spent billions of dollars with fake news.
[01:13:42.281 --> 01:13:51.904]  I mean, most of the people attacking us on blogs and posts, you'll see the same guys under different names saying the exact same thing on thousands, literally, of posts and blogs.
[01:13:52.364 --> 01:13:55.345]  And people now see right through it!
[01:13:55.706 --> 01:13:59.347]  In fact, it's almost like it's been bad, because
[01:14:00.296 --> 01:14:18.074]  I mean, obviously it's bad they're out doing it, but people waking up completely to it is almost bad, because now they think anybody criticizing those of us that fight the New World Order is a shell, and they're not all, and I want to be able to have real debates, and, you know, we get things wrong, and we deserve to be attacked sometimes, and that's fine.
[01:14:18.174 --> 01:14:18.714]  I don't care.
[01:14:19.195 --> 01:14:24.160]  The point is, now, anybody that attacks me is instantly, or anybody else is instantly a fad.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:37.284]  Because when you've got $1.8 billion in just a two-year period of fake news, large portions of it to buy reporters and buy fake blogs at Walmart and Microsoft have got a piece, thousands of fake blogs.
[01:14:37.764 --> 01:14:39.245]  That was in the news yesterday again.
[01:14:40.305 --> 01:14:46.647]  You know, it gets to the point of... I don't think this government realizes how discredited they are.
[01:14:47.548 --> 01:14:48.108]  Go ahead, caller.
[01:14:48.743 --> 01:15:01.832]  I just want to say, if everyone did this, every single email they got, even if at the very end they just say, go to Google Video and watch Terror Storm, or go to Google Video and watch Freedom to Fascism, or just put InfoWars.com at the end of every email, it's just going to start to sink in.
[01:15:01.992 --> 01:15:07.276]  I've had people call me back later and say, you know, after a month of this, I got fed up and I checked it out, and now they're believing a little bit.
[01:15:07.296 --> 01:15:07.476]  Good job!
[01:15:08.977 --> 01:15:13.619]  So if everyone did that, and everyone's saying, Alex, do this, Alex, do that, well, what if we all do something?
[01:15:13.659 --> 01:15:20.142]  If every single email you send out, you put VisitTerrorStorm, or I'm sorry, VisitInfoWars.com at the end of it, it would just help spread the word.
[01:15:20.702 --> 01:15:21.162]  Thank you.
[01:15:21.222 --> 01:15:22.123]  I appreciate that.
[01:15:23.103 --> 01:15:24.324]  You know, I do this show.
[01:15:26.465 --> 01:15:26.865]  Excuse me.
[01:15:27.245 --> 01:15:29.966]  Again, for stations carrying the show today, I apologize.
[01:15:29.986 --> 01:15:31.006]  I probably shouldn't have done the show.
[01:15:31.047 --> 01:15:31.467]  I'm sick.
[01:15:31.487 --> 01:15:34.328]  I didn't want to stand up our big guest we've got in the next hour.
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:40.884]  And the reason I'm announcing each hour that I'm sick on air is in case people think I've had my brain sucked out or something.
[01:15:41.664 --> 01:15:46.627]  I'm just stifling coughing fits here.
[01:15:49.909 --> 01:15:58.094]  I don't know, I might punch out 30 minutes into the next hour and just have the guest on 30 minutes because my earache is kicking up a bit here and it's hard to think.
[01:15:58.194 --> 01:15:59.715]  But hold on.
[01:16:04.318 --> 01:16:13.844]  Going back to what the caller was just saying, I've described this to my wife.
[01:16:13.884 --> 01:16:15.885]  I've never really described this on air, but it's like this.
[01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:21.688]  It's like we're climbing a mountain range in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:33.355]  And years ago, we were in the foothills, and it was just gentle little slopes, and it was picturesque, you could say.
[01:16:34.128 --> 01:16:36.429]  And really, a lot of people weren't listening to us.
[01:16:37.509 --> 01:16:46.933]  But now, we've gotten to the point, I'm talking about the alternative media movement, the truth movement, the patriot movement, it's all an amalgamation, people who don't buy the fraud.
[01:16:49.234 --> 01:16:53.536]  We've gotten now to where we're on the next to the biggest peak.
[01:16:54.697 --> 01:17:02.920]  And we've just got to go down this peak a little bit and then back up and we'll be at the summit of the tallest mountain in this range.
[01:17:06.184 --> 01:17:16.090]  I mean, in my own info war, in my own gauge of things, financially, I'm a failure.
[01:17:18.432 --> 01:17:20.353]  What they tell you is valuable.
[01:17:21.373 --> 01:17:26.076]  What they tell you as a measure of success is how many zeros and ones you've got in a bank account.
[01:17:26.717 --> 01:17:30.659]  I mean, for the size my websites are, they should be making tens of millions of dollars a year, but they don't.
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:35.162]  Because they don't make a fraction of a million.
[01:17:35.999 --> 01:17:43.602]  Because they aren't geared to that, and whatever does come in is just put back into the business.
[01:17:45.142 --> 01:17:55.726]  But if you measure it as a success of reaching people in an information war, what the government would call propaganda, it is wildly successful.
[01:17:58.547 --> 01:18:05.030]  I mean, one would think that it would be hard to start out with an access TV show, do a radio show, get a syndicated radio show,
[01:18:05.934 --> 01:18:11.298]  Do thousands of radio interviews, go to every hill and mountain, basically, and try to warn the people.
[01:18:11.858 --> 01:18:15.921]  And just in my little life, I've had a huge effect.
[01:18:20.645 --> 01:18:23.307]  Now, it's an incredible growth rate.
[01:18:24.248 --> 01:18:27.210]  And so if you look at where we're at, we're at the next to highest peak.
[01:18:28.050 --> 01:18:31.293]  I mean, if we go up one more level in the scale of media,
[01:18:35.171 --> 01:18:36.432]  It'll be the biggest thing there is.
[01:18:39.494 --> 01:18:48.459]  And I'm just one ship out here engaging the New World Order in a naval battle, basically.
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.420]  If you can picture it like that.
[01:18:51.081 --> 01:18:59.526]  We need you to realize that if you put your bass boat into Mara, a year from now it might be a battleship or an aircraft carrier.
[01:19:01.327 --> 01:19:04.069]  There are people smarter than I am, a lot more well-spoken,
[01:19:05.902 --> 01:19:12.544]  Who should be out fighting the New World Order, then you know about it, but you're afraid, or you don't see that as your position.
[01:19:12.564 --> 01:19:14.785]  You know, we've all been taught, oh, it's for the hero to do.
[01:19:15.325 --> 01:19:16.625]  It's for somebody else to do.
[01:19:16.705 --> 01:19:18.086]  It's for that guy to do.
[01:19:19.146 --> 01:19:25.428]  And we're not going to win in a fight where it's just a few of us out there doing it.
[01:19:26.068 --> 01:19:34.831]  And, you know, the 12 years or so I've been on air, if you compare it to the effect that a film like Luce Shane's second edition had,
[01:19:37.089 --> 01:19:42.171]  That is conservatively been downloaded over 40 million times.
[01:19:42.191 --> 01:19:45.672]  Everybody's stuck with a number from eight, nine months ago.
[01:19:45.692 --> 01:19:46.752]  You're on 10 million or whatever.
[01:19:48.573 --> 01:19:53.674]  I mean, that just shows what the alternative media can do.
[01:19:54.715 --> 01:19:58.536]  And it shows what Dylan Avery, when he was 22, what is he, 23 now?
[01:20:00.136 --> 01:20:00.556]  Can do.
[01:20:04.237 --> 01:20:05.778]  And it shows what you can do.
[01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:10.358]  And it shows what you need to do.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.061]  Look, you need to believe that we can beat them.
[01:20:15.382 --> 01:20:16.202]  You need to know.
[01:20:16.222 --> 01:20:17.863]  They're scared of us.
[01:20:20.405 --> 01:20:21.766]  They can't control the truth.
[01:20:22.707 --> 01:20:24.448]  And they're not going to control the truth.
[01:20:25.849 --> 01:20:26.789]  We're going to get them.
[01:20:26.809 --> 01:20:27.450]  They're going to hang.
[01:20:32.381 --> 01:20:33.142]  Terrorism!
[01:20:33.302 --> 01:20:34.062]  Terrorism!
[01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:40.207]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:20:40.487 --> 01:20:44.810]  Alarming words for our time, but how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:20:45.190 --> 01:20:59.760]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:00.101]  government.
[01:21:00.281 --> 01:21:02.042]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:21:02.462 --> 01:21:08.366]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:21:08.506 --> 01:21:12.968]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[01:21:40.343 --> 01:21:45.946]  Did you know that the United Nations is building its own army to enforce its will upon the world?
[01:21:46.567 --> 01:21:52.671]  Did you know that they've empowered themselves to cross sovereign nations' borders without consent with their armies?

[01:22:32.296 --> 01:22:36.197]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:22:36.417 --> 01:22:48.680]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:49.520]  The U.S.
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:55.142]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:22:55.542 --> 01:22:57.743]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:22:59.603 --> 01:23:00.664]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:23:00.704 --> 01:23:03.547]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:23:03.668 --> 01:23:09.694]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:23:10.134 --> 01:23:13.478]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[01:23:32.532 --> 01:23:34.892]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.

[01:24:57.023 --> 01:25:04.047]  And when the band plays, hell to the chief Lord knows, they point the cannon at you.
[01:25:04.067 --> 01:25:05.388]  Stop that!
[01:25:05.428 --> 01:25:08.190]  God, it ain't me.
[01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:09.550]  It ain't me, no.
[01:25:09.671 --> 01:25:12.232]  I ain't no sinner, that's all.
[01:25:15.914 --> 01:25:18.577]  Can you hear me?
[01:25:19.057 --> 01:25:35.372]  It ain't mean nothin' It ain't mean nothin' I ain't the fortunate one Some folks are born, still with food in their hand Lord, don't they have them still?
[01:25:35.412 --> 01:25:39.896]  The taxman give them the key to the land
[01:25:42.658 --> 01:25:46.021]  There was a party, nothing left but school and hell.
[01:25:46.661 --> 01:25:48.403]  Yeah, trust me.
[01:25:49.063 --> 01:25:50.224]  It ain't me, no.
[01:25:50.364 --> 01:25:51.425]  It ain't me, no.
[01:25:51.685 --> 01:25:54.007]  I ain't no millionaire son, yeah.
[01:25:59.632 --> 01:26:00.733]  It ain't me, no.
[01:26:01.074 --> 01:26:03.837]  It ain't me, no.
[01:26:04.358 --> 01:26:08.122]  I ain't the fortunate one.
[01:26:08.202 --> 01:26:13.649]  The folks I love, inherits our friends' lives.
[01:26:13.729 --> 01:26:17.534]  I don't need to send you off to war.
[01:26:20.519 --> 01:26:28.201]  Welcome back.
[01:26:31.261 --> 01:26:45.925]  Okay, I'm going to go to your calls in the next seconds.
[01:26:45.965 --> 01:26:47.485]  We have plenty of time to get to everybody.
[01:26:48.991 --> 01:26:57.476]  Tim and Kim and Joe and Paul and Ron and everybody else, toll-free number to join us on this already fourth day of the new year, January 4th, 2006.
[01:26:57.516 --> 01:27:07.583]  On the Saddam story, everything about the New World Order is done in a gangsterish way.
[01:27:08.563 --> 01:27:13.006]  You know, the Nazis with their fancy black uniforms, it was still a gangsterish air.
[01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:19.494]  And Stalin just radiated gangsterishness and mal to a certain extent.
[01:27:19.554 --> 01:27:22.997]  But there is no Iraqi government, folks.
[01:27:23.057 --> 01:27:25.099]  The Iraqi government doesn't exist.
[01:27:25.179 --> 01:27:26.700]  It runs absolutely nothing.
[01:27:27.401 --> 01:27:33.926]  They don't even have one brigade of Iraqi National Guard.
[01:27:34.026 --> 01:27:36.208]  Not one that can operate.
[01:27:37.389 --> 01:27:37.789]  Okay?
[01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:39.851]  Trash is not picked up.
[01:27:40.473 --> 01:27:44.614]  They get power now in Baghdad about three hours a day.
[01:27:45.094 --> 01:27:48.435]  Most of the cities in the country have no power.
[01:27:49.895 --> 01:27:53.616]  No power unless it is a local government building that runs off generators.
[01:27:55.776 --> 01:27:58.077]  And it's been carried out flawlessly.
[01:27:58.537 --> 01:28:03.238]  George Bush and his controllers have executed exactly as they said they would.
[01:28:04.538 --> 01:28:06.719]  And 650 plus thousand are dead.
[01:28:06.859 --> 01:28:08.239]  That number is three or four months old.
[01:28:10.652 --> 01:28:11.973]  Just in the last three and a half years.
[01:28:15.117 --> 01:28:18.280]  And so, you look at Saddam Hussein.
[01:28:19.341 --> 01:28:21.203]  I've read two books on Saddam Hussein.
[01:28:21.303 --> 01:28:23.005]  One book against him, one book for him.
[01:28:25.527 --> 01:28:28.170]  Well, one was neutral and the other was a hit piece I should say.
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:34.581]  And I've read the, you know, different university papers on him.
[01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:35.862]  I read a couple the other night.
[01:28:35.882 --> 01:28:40.223]  I wanted to make sure I really had refreshed myself so I knew what I was talking about.
[01:28:40.343 --> 01:28:41.404]  My memory did serve me.
[01:28:43.684 --> 01:28:51.827]  He was an orphan, and he got scooped up by the intelligence services within weeks.
[01:28:53.061 --> 01:29:02.151]  Because he had high test scores and was very smart, and as many politicians have said, he projected a zen calmness.
[01:29:03.192 --> 01:29:04.894]  This is an alpha male.
[01:29:05.355 --> 01:29:11.361]  You know you're around those type of people, like this person just radiates confidence, not false confidence.
[01:29:13.063 --> 01:29:14.405]  And so the CIA recruited him.
[01:29:17.692 --> 01:29:20.334]  And they led him to the path to power.
[01:29:20.494 --> 01:29:22.536]  In 79 he became the dictator and he followed orders.
[01:29:22.556 --> 01:29:24.337]  He attacked Iran and everything he was supposed to.
[01:29:24.898 --> 01:29:26.499]  But he wanted to be seen as a leader.
[01:29:26.559 --> 01:29:27.560]  He was a real leader.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:31.302]  Certainly a butcher compared to our leaders.
[01:29:31.542 --> 01:29:32.623]  He was a choir boy.
[01:29:33.504 --> 01:29:36.606]  And of course our government helped him do the butchering and helped orchestrate all of it.
[01:29:37.387 --> 01:29:39.368]  Until 91 and stuff after that he did.
[01:29:45.271 --> 01:29:55.576]  It's just so hypocritical and sick to watch our government prance around about how they killed somebody who was really bad when the guy was doing it and when the guy was set up.
[01:29:57.277 --> 01:30:01.619]  But what separated Saddam Hussein from the elite we have, this is why they set him up.
[01:30:03.099 --> 01:30:03.720]  Well, I'll tell ya.
[01:30:05.461 --> 01:30:06.141]  My take on it.
[01:30:07.842 --> 01:30:09.883]  Briefly, we'll get back and we'll go straight to your calls.
[01:30:11.784 --> 01:30:12.484]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:22.476 --> 01:30:23.396]  We're on the march.
[01:30:23.856 --> 01:30:25.516]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:26.377 --> 01:30:29.237]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:32.638 --> 01:30:36.618]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[01:30:36.838 --> 01:30:40.359]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:30:40.639 --> 01:30:44.720]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:45.960]  I was so amazed.
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:51.104]  Perfect nightlight, both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:30:51.485 --> 01:30:56.732]  Soleil Wellness dot com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[01:30:57.152 --> 01:31:03.080]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[01:31:03.341 --> 01:31:04.923]  I figured it would clean really well.

[01:32:32.559 --> 01:32:33.560]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:38.421]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:32:38.581 --> 01:32:46.383]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:32:46.643 --> 01:32:52.004]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:32:52.224 --> 01:32:59.206]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:32:59.506 --> 01:33:04.829]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:33:05.109 --> 01:33:09.811]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:33:10.171 --> 01:33:17.755]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:33:18.095 --> 01:33:24.340]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:25.861]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:33:25.881 --> 01:33:26.122]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:33:55.702 --> 01:33:56.142]  All right.
[01:34:00.585 --> 01:34:01.265]  Welcome back.
[01:34:04.087 --> 01:34:18.996]  All right, to understand what happened with Saddam Hussein, we need to go back to the fact that in the early 1920s, what is Iraq today was really three different tribal regions.
[01:34:19.297 --> 01:34:19.837]  The Sunni,
[01:34:20.703 --> 01:34:29.846]  In the central areas, the Shiite in the south, and in the north, the Kurds.
[01:34:31.227 --> 01:34:37.149]  They always warred with each other, but it was almost ritualistic.
[01:34:37.349 --> 01:34:39.129]  It happened every few decades.
[01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:40.950]  I've actually done a brief study of that.
[01:34:41.530 --> 01:34:43.711]  History is so big, and you can't be an expert on history, folks.
[01:34:43.731 --> 01:34:44.571]  You're always a student.
[01:34:50.934 --> 01:35:03.519]  Basically what happened was the British came in, Anglo-American oil, Standard Oil, and I forget the name of the, we had trouble pronouncing it, the French oil company.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:16.125]  And they divided the country, well they created the country, but then still along sectarian lines and racial lines, you should call it ethnic or tribal lines, it's really the same genetics, same people.
[01:35:17.868 --> 01:35:45.190]  kept the original borders that had been in the region but but but drew a line around iraq and made it one country and they put a saudi king in over them and there was an unbelievable slaughter that kicked off
[01:35:46.716 --> 01:36:08.133]  uh... through that period then in the late fifties some socialists got control in kind of restored order and there was sectarian killing going on there and nothing on the scale you're seeing now and then they decided to send in Saddam and a bunch of other assassins that the U.S.
[01:36:08.173 --> 01:36:08.474]  trained.
[01:36:08.494 --> 01:36:10.815]  This is on record and we're talking U.P.I.A.P.
[01:36:10.956 --> 01:36:11.236]  okay?
[01:36:11.836 --> 01:36:13.197]  In the eighties this was all in the news.
[01:36:13.317 --> 01:36:14.318]  Oh, Saddam's a great guy.
[01:36:14.358 --> 01:36:14.819]  We trained him.
[01:36:14.859 --> 01:36:15.179]  He's good.
[01:36:16.246 --> 01:36:39.199]  Then he did go in, and they did take over, and of course he really did do things like, you know, he'd have 65 people in a big conference room when he's the head of Bathurst Security in 79, and he, you know, he says, uh, 25 of you are traitors and take them out and have them shot and the rest of you aren't traitors.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:43.622]  But historians have looked at it and it looks like they really were
[01:36:44.998 --> 01:37:03.646]  uh... working for the west and they really were uh... what you can call traders i'm not defending having a mall taken out the shot i mean saddam saddam was a quote bad guy it's just compared to hajji mubarak today see all the slaughtering and killing and torture camps are kept real quiet
[01:37:04.597 --> 01:37:06.537]  His persecution of Christians is kept quiet.
[01:37:06.637 --> 01:37:10.638]  All the things, these puppets that have been installed, that's all kept quiet.
[01:37:10.658 --> 01:37:11.898]  And then it's all Saddam, man.
[01:37:11.938 --> 01:37:13.159]  He's the new Adolf Hitler.
[01:37:13.639 --> 01:37:15.199]  And he is no Adolf Hitler.
[01:37:17.339 --> 01:37:19.640]  Saddam tried to get everybody to get along with each other.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:28.902]  And he took that country from a backward, third-world nation to a first-world nation with 60%
[01:37:31.488 --> 01:37:54.234]  Other graduates being women, no more burkas, no more having to cover their faces, he was modernizing it to become a tourist destination, and he was obsessed with giving people land and property and, I mean, not putting people on welfare, actually setting them up.
[01:37:55.355 --> 01:38:00.596]  He thought the state, you know, could infuse a free market and make them a dynamo.
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:12.388]  Now, he was still very friendly with the West, and they were encouraging him, and plus he didn't like the Persians, that's the Iranians, and so he was encouraged to attack them, and he did.
[01:38:15.991 --> 01:38:22.276]  And it's on record that our government gave him the satellite, the weather reports, the advice, told him, go ahead and nerve gas them.
[01:38:23.137 --> 01:38:29.442]  He was starting to lose the war with the Iranians, because they had three times the troops he had, and they were better equipped.
[01:38:32.825 --> 01:38:38.188]  And the globalists were playing the two off against each other, trying to make both nations weak!
[01:38:42.631 --> 01:39:00.161]  And that's why the New World Order didn't like Saddam at the end of the Iran-Iraq War, because he was seen as a strong Arab leader, he was admired, and he kind of stabbed them in the back for putting him in and said, now I'm not buddies with Israel, I'm going to be a leader and we're going to be first world,
[01:39:01.573 --> 01:39:03.635]  And then the West came back and said, OK, we'll be friends with you.
[01:39:04.315 --> 01:39:07.878]  And by the way, go ahead and invade Kuwait if you want to, because they were slant drilling.
[01:39:09.319 --> 01:39:10.960]  He was trying to pay off the debts.
[01:39:12.581 --> 01:39:14.543]  And so that's why they took him out.
[01:39:14.603 --> 01:39:16.364]  Same reason they took out Slobodan Milošević.
[01:39:18.951 --> 01:39:26.235]  Who certainly wasn't perfect, but compared to what the Muslims and Croats did, and please folks, I know Croats are nice people in the U.S., so are Muslims.
[01:39:26.275 --> 01:39:27.756]  I'm not trying to get in fights with you.
[01:39:28.436 --> 01:39:31.098]  I'm not a Croat, I'm not a Muslim, I'm not a Serb.
[01:39:31.598 --> 01:39:43.584]  I really looked at it, the history, and the Serbs did about a third of the killing that the Croats and the Muslims, who teamed up, by the way, with the Nazis in World War II against the Serbs, who helped us.
[01:39:44.285 --> 01:39:46.566]  That's what they get for helping us and saving our airmen.
[01:39:48.484 --> 01:39:50.906]  They didn't like the fact they had big mines all over the country.
[01:39:51.327 --> 01:39:54.189]  They were making high-quality aircraft and trains and engines.
[01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:59.194]  It was becoming First World, a big holiday destination for Europeans.
[01:40:00.535 --> 01:40:00.815]  Europe!
[01:40:01.436 --> 01:40:07.221]  NATO and the EU did not like the modernization programs of Slavon Milošević.
[01:40:08.142 --> 01:40:12.986]  Trying, I guess, to be a new Tito, who certainly wasn't perfect, but compared to
[01:40:15.882 --> 01:40:18.945]  The point is, the globalists want to remove these people.
[01:40:20.106 --> 01:40:32.416]  They want to remove anybody who's nationalistic, and who really wants to... Saddam really wanted... Slobodan Milosevic really wanted to modernize their countries, and to be liked by the population.
[01:40:32.436 --> 01:40:34.818]  It's the same thing with Jack Kennedy.
[01:40:35.218 --> 01:40:37.179]  Cut taxes by half, he was a hawk.
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:40.142]  He woke up to the fact they were scaring him, they blew his head off.
[01:40:41.283 --> 01:40:45.766]  He gave speeches about a conspiracy to take over America, great evil, we've played it here.
[01:40:46.647 --> 01:40:47.147]  They killed him.
[01:40:47.668 --> 01:40:52.571]  I mean, there are people who get into positions of power who really want to try to help their people.
[01:40:53.612 --> 01:41:01.538]  And Saddam, to do that, he would say, I'm not going to allow sectarian violence to break out again, that we've had for, you know, 60-something years there.
[01:41:02.879 --> 01:41:05.241]  This is, I'm talking about the 80's now, it'd be 60 years back.
[01:41:06.241 --> 01:41:13.205]  And so, you know, that was his excuse to do it, and that's always the road to tyranny, when, oh, you're doing these evil things, you know, for the betterment down the road.
[01:41:14.286 --> 01:41:21.070]  But it turned out that, overall, it did make Iraq a better place, and it did reduce the numbers of killings and things that happened.
[01:41:21.870 --> 01:41:25.953]  That's why in the court proceedings that were totally run by our military, in the U.S.
[01:41:25.993 --> 01:41:29.435]  government, they fired judges and killed four of Saddam's lawyers.
[01:41:29.475 --> 01:41:30.035]  Remember all that?
[01:41:30.575 --> 01:41:33.097]  That's why they didn't want to prosecute him for the nerve-gassing.
[01:41:35.466 --> 01:41:42.572]  And then they made him put a 20 minute delay on all the Saddam court transmissions because he kept bringing all that up.
[01:41:44.013 --> 01:41:49.577]  And court observers would see him talk about that and then they'd walk out the street and get gunned down so they wouldn't talk to the media.
[01:41:50.458 --> 01:41:51.599]  I mean, that's your fair trial.
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:53.841]  That's why you have fair trials.
[01:41:54.201 --> 01:41:55.502]  Sure, Saddam's a bad guy.
[01:41:57.953 --> 01:42:08.963]  And did some bad things, but you always have a trial so other people they're involved with, and so the full facts of the case come out so the people can be informed.
[01:42:10.404 --> 01:42:22.675]  And boy, if the public learned what was really done to Saddam, what was really done to the Iraqi people, and how hypocritical it was, then you wouldn't see people cheering him hanging from the neck until dead.
[01:42:25.991 --> 01:42:32.096]  But a picture tells a thousand words, and that two-minute video of them hanging him tells a million.
[01:42:33.478 --> 01:42:45.788]  I mean, you have just mafia-style thugs directly, you know, Saddam directly handed over to them, and they were trying to get a rise out of him, and he knew exactly what they were doing, and in the end, he beat them.
[01:42:48.230 --> 01:42:51.413]  In the end, he was dignified.
[01:42:53.104 --> 01:42:56.925]  And to everyone, everybody saw really the spirit of this.
[01:42:57.845 --> 01:43:05.067]  The spirit of this whole thing was a bunch of thugs in black masks hanging a U.S.
[01:43:05.107 --> 01:43:17.190]  government agent who had broken away from the New World Order and who really tried to bring stability and free market and education for Sunni, Shiite, and Kurd.
[01:43:20.251 --> 01:43:21.251]  And that's why they killed him.
[01:43:25.026 --> 01:43:26.567]  And that's why they went in and took him down.
[01:43:28.948 --> 01:43:36.231]  But there's always going to be that lasting image that really showed the mafioso thuggishness.
[01:43:37.371 --> 01:43:43.794]  And it showed everybody in a room full of killers who the gutter snipes were.
[01:43:43.814 --> 01:43:49.937]  And it showed who the cowards were.
[01:43:50.177 --> 01:43:53.639]  They were freaking out like a bunch of brain dogs.
[01:43:54.099 --> 01:43:54.399]  They were
[01:43:55.689 --> 01:44:06.918]  You know, they were pleasuring themselves at the prospect of murdering, of killing, and it just illustrated it.
[01:44:06.958 --> 01:44:14.884]  I mean, Iraq is hundreds of times worse than it was in 1990.
[01:44:17.045 --> 01:44:24.331]  This is an extermination program going on as they wreck Iraq and basically leave no stone
[01:44:25.197 --> 01:44:30.279]  unturned in taking that place back to cavemanville.
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:35.641]  And that is the state of Israeli and U.S.
[01:44:36.362 --> 01:44:42.504]  policy is the global Balkans.
[01:44:45.205 --> 01:44:46.226]  Balkanization.
[01:44:46.926 --> 01:44:47.947]  Divide and conquer.
[01:44:48.367 --> 01:44:49.027]  And the U.S.
[01:44:49.067 --> 01:44:50.168]  is being Balkanized?
[01:44:50.228 --> 01:44:51.028]  The same people
[01:44:53.078 --> 01:45:03.743]  That pulled the strings to drop Saddam through that trap door and break his neck are the same people that have devalued your dollar premeditatedly.
[01:45:04.563 --> 01:45:06.584]  They're the same people dissolving your border.
[01:45:07.225 --> 01:45:13.427]  They're the same people that want to shoot you up with flu vaccine with five times the safe levels of mercury in it.
[01:45:15.008 --> 01:45:18.770]  They're the same people that are spraying our food and water with poison.
[01:45:19.170 --> 01:45:21.091]  They're the same people putting poison in our
[01:45:21.954 --> 01:45:22.734]  Into our bodies.
[01:45:23.895 --> 01:45:27.336]  They're the same people and then they're in control because they are the most evil.
[01:45:27.356 --> 01:45:28.056]  They brag about it.
[01:45:28.776 --> 01:45:30.257]  They're the most far-looking.
[01:45:30.277 --> 01:45:31.537]  They're the most maniacal.
[01:45:33.238 --> 01:45:37.420]  And we as a people need to understand the threat is not in Iran.
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:39.800]  The threat is not in Iraq.
[01:45:40.721 --> 01:45:42.001]  The threat is in London.
[01:45:42.882 --> 01:45:43.742]  In New York.
[01:45:45.002 --> 01:45:45.923]  And in Berlin.
[01:45:46.823 --> 01:45:47.643]  And in Paris.
[01:45:48.364 --> 01:45:49.284]  And in Moscow.
[01:45:50.069 --> 01:45:54.430]  And in Tel Aviv, and in Beijing, and in Tokyo.
[01:45:58.770 --> 01:46:09.072]  The threat is this elite working together to weaken the people and make us more easy to manage.
[01:46:11.193 --> 01:46:15.893]  And so all these good old boys cheered and got just excited about the killing of Saddam.
[01:46:15.933 --> 01:46:17.934]  It was like a personal power for them.
[01:46:18.794 --> 01:46:19.374]  And again, I could
[01:46:20.547 --> 01:46:22.587]  Saddam Hussein deserved to die.
[01:46:24.628 --> 01:46:29.369]  But he's like, there's like a million people in front of him who were worse who also deserve to die.
[01:46:29.969 --> 01:46:31.869]  And that's why I'm for the death penalty.
[01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:34.850]  I believe in an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
[01:46:37.190 --> 01:46:45.072]  But I don't believe that it should be in effect today because we know that around a third of the people in the prisons are innocent.
[01:46:46.292 --> 01:46:49.533]  And we know this government's so criminal that they're not even
[01:46:52.958 --> 01:46:57.042]  Qualified to clean toilets.
[01:46:57.843 --> 01:46:58.924]  To be a toilet attendant.
[01:47:01.986 --> 01:47:04.649]  And so, let's go to your calls.
[01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:06.110]  I'll quit babbling.
[01:47:07.231 --> 01:47:10.374]  Let's go ahead and talk to, uh, who's up first?
[01:47:10.414 --> 01:47:10.674]  Tim?
[01:47:11.595 --> 01:47:12.376]  Tim, Kim, and others.
[01:47:12.456 --> 01:47:13.297]  Okay, Tim, go ahead.
[01:47:13.757 --> 01:47:14.198]  Hello, Alex.
[01:47:14.558 --> 01:47:14.798]  Hi.
[01:47:15.519 --> 01:47:17.180]  Uh, first of all, I'll have a Green Mile.
[01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:18.822]  I'm trying to pull that sickness out of you.
[01:47:20.541 --> 01:47:46.014]  I got sick myself, I was watching this congress coordination, I gotta call Alex and tell him about this article I found in the purveyor of propaganda, Time Magazine, December issue, building, how to build the 21st century, just, you know, it's about the public brainwashing system, of course, and they actually mentioned loose change in there, and I wanted to call and tell you about it, but a couple of other
[01:47:47.813 --> 01:47:50.754]  What were they saying concerning loose change in education?
[01:47:50.994 --> 01:47:52.575]  I'll read you the paragraph about it.
[01:47:52.695 --> 01:47:59.037]  They're talking about these pilot schools that they have to get these, um... Well, it's mentioned in this one paragraph.
[01:47:59.057 --> 01:47:59.518]  Let me read it to you.
[01:47:59.958 --> 01:48:14.223]  The jurors, juniors, in Bill Stout's class are riveted by a documentary called Loose Change, unspooling on a small TV screen at the Bachelorette School for Global Education in urban Astoria, New York.
[01:48:14.775 --> 01:48:30.238]  The film uses 9-11 footage and interviews with building engineers and Twin Tower supervisors to make an oddly compelling, if paranoid, case that the interior explosions unrelated to the impact of the airplanes brought down the World Trade Center... Oh, really?
[01:48:30.298 --> 01:48:33.558]  NIST, NIST, NIST now admits that there may have been bombs.
[01:48:35.139 --> 01:48:35.839]  But it's interesting.
[01:48:35.879 --> 01:48:42.880]  They also, the authors of this thing, who I'm not going to mention, they have to throw some double think in there.
[01:48:43.886 --> 01:48:49.451]  And it says, uh, some person finds the video more convincing than the official version of the facts.
[01:48:50.072 --> 01:48:51.413]  Another student objected.
[01:48:52.014 --> 01:48:55.737]  Because of a movie, you are going to change your beliefs, she demands.
[01:48:56.118 --> 01:49:00.802]  Just because people heard explosions doesn't mean they were explosions.
[01:49:03.166 --> 01:49:04.647]  More direct, direct, double take.
[01:49:04.687 --> 01:49:12.371]  Yeah, just because we've got fire captains on tape saying, did you see the, it was like a foundry, molten steel flowing, like a volcano.
[01:49:12.671 --> 01:49:15.072]  That gets back to the theory of cognitive dissonance.
[01:49:15.372 --> 01:49:16.753]  By the way, pull that clip, John.
[01:49:17.633 --> 01:49:18.714]  Go ahead, keep going, Tim.
[01:49:19.134 --> 01:49:19.534]  Oh, it's okay.
[01:49:21.575 --> 01:49:23.836]  And it's interesting little sentences.
[01:49:23.896 --> 01:49:28.759]  This public elementary school has taken the idea of global education and run with it.
[01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:32.721]  Stanford International, that's the name of the school.
[01:49:33.251 --> 01:49:38.535]  Shows what's possible for a public elementary school, although it has... And you see the message?
[01:49:38.695 --> 01:49:41.897]  Globalism is rebellious and showing loose change.
[01:49:42.378 --> 01:49:45.100]  So see, oh, we can trust the good liberal globalists.
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:46.301]  They let us know the truth.
[01:49:47.101 --> 01:49:48.863]  And then, oh, it's all America's fault.
[01:49:48.903 --> 01:49:49.943]  America was involved.
[01:49:49.983 --> 01:49:51.204]  America did 9-11.
[01:49:51.364 --> 01:49:53.306]  And they have support with corporations from Nintendo.
[01:49:53.326 --> 01:49:54.487]  You've been listening a long time, Tim.
[01:49:54.507 --> 01:49:56.628]  How long did I say they're going to allow 9-11 to come out?
[01:49:58.044 --> 01:49:59.725]  They're just going to blame it on the U.S.
[01:49:59.765 --> 01:50:02.187]  and not explain that the globalists are using the U.S.
[01:50:02.807 --> 01:50:09.892]  Then we'll have another fake trial hanging here, and that'll further... You know, I think that many times I've asked you that same question.
[01:50:10.192 --> 01:50:11.133]  What's going to happen?
[01:50:11.393 --> 01:50:13.534]  They're holding off on that.
[01:50:14.014 --> 01:50:19.118]  And then, yeah, just like you said, they're going to come out and say, oh, yeah, everybody's right.
[01:50:20.078 --> 01:50:20.719]  They were in on it.
[01:50:20.899 --> 01:50:24.021]  Now we're going to hang and we're going to totally take over the rest of what's left of your country.
[01:50:26.587 --> 01:50:28.108]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:50:28.188 --> 01:50:28.668]  Take care.
[01:50:28.728 --> 01:50:29.969]  Let's play that clip.
[01:50:29.989 --> 01:50:41.173]  There's a New York television of firefighters talking about how it was like a foundry of molten steel flowing, but it wouldn't melt people standing near the hottest fires.
[01:50:41.214 --> 01:50:42.854]  They could stand there for 20 minutes in the holes.
[01:50:43.434 --> 01:50:46.896]  It was localized heat sources that generated it.
[01:50:46.936 --> 01:50:47.276]  Here it is.
[01:50:52.282 --> 01:50:52.542]  Who knew?
[01:50:53.403 --> 01:50:56.424]  To be honest with you, I think he might have thought that was it for us, Phil.
[01:50:56.744 --> 01:50:59.586]  You'd get down below and you'd see molten steel.
[01:51:00.246 --> 01:51:02.267]  Molten steel running down the channel rails.
[01:51:02.687 --> 01:51:05.529]  Like you're in a foundry, you know?
[01:51:05.549 --> 01:51:05.809]  Yeah.
[01:51:05.949 --> 01:51:06.249]  Like lava.
[01:51:06.269 --> 01:51:07.350]  Like lava in a volcano.
[01:51:07.370 --> 01:51:09.451]  There was a lot of screaming.
[01:51:09.471 --> 01:51:10.431]  There wasn't a lot of yelling.
[01:51:10.952 --> 01:51:12.392]  Obviously, there was no machinery.
[01:51:12.412 --> 01:51:13.253]  All right.
[01:51:13.353 --> 01:51:16.274]  It was like a foundry.
[01:51:17.815 --> 01:51:19.196]  Like a volcano.
[01:51:21.241 --> 01:51:29.803]  Oh yeah, jet fuel melts giant forefoot around steel and turns it into molten steel running down the channel rails.
[01:51:35.325 --> 01:51:40.786]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:51:41.146 --> 01:51:48.808]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:49.494 --> 01:51:56.537]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:56.938 --> 01:52:08.343]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:52:08.683 --> 01:52:12.185]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:52:12.645 --> 01:52:14.586]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:52:14.906 --> 01:52:18.748]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:54:27.906 --> 01:54:30.528]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[01:54:34.824 --> 01:54:40.847]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:54:41.467 --> 01:54:44.449]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:46.750 --> 01:54:48.851]  And I mean, we're behind enemy lines.
[01:54:48.931 --> 01:54:49.372]  The U.S.
[01:54:49.412 --> 01:54:51.833]  has been seized as an engine of world government.
[01:54:52.693 --> 01:54:56.255]  While we take the blame for everything the globalists do using us, we're occupied.
[01:54:58.056 --> 01:54:59.137]  Alright, let's continue with your calls.
[01:54:59.177 --> 01:55:01.098]  I've got a big guest coming up in the third hour.
[01:55:01.838 --> 01:55:03.779]  Kim in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:55:05.074 --> 01:55:08.175]  Hi Alex, and you are not babbling, you are teaching.
[01:55:08.876 --> 01:55:12.937]  Everything you said brought back to mind when they attacked Noriega.
[01:55:13.758 --> 01:55:14.638]  They went after him.
[01:55:14.658 --> 01:55:19.040]  And this conquer and divide system, they've been using it since slavery.
[01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:24.582]  Whether it's religion, or race, or injustices, period.
[01:55:24.922 --> 01:55:26.723]  That's what they're doing in America now.
[01:55:27.372 --> 01:55:28.712]  And we have to look past that.
[01:55:28.772 --> 01:55:35.794]  And I don't understand why, in 2007, we cannot look past these divisions that they put up in front of us.
[01:55:36.435 --> 01:55:38.795]  Barack Obama.
[01:55:39.615 --> 01:55:43.777]  This guy is going to be the worst person you could put in as a president.
[01:55:44.097 --> 01:55:45.777]  Barack Obama, I don't trust.
[01:55:46.157 --> 01:55:47.197]  He's for amnesty.
[01:55:47.818 --> 01:55:49.038]  He's for the Patriot Act.
[01:55:49.198 --> 01:55:52.539]  I spoke to his people, because I have not spoken with him.
[01:55:54.045 --> 01:55:55.926]  No, I've seen his voting record.
[01:55:55.966 --> 01:55:56.966]  He voted for H.R.
[01:55:56.986 --> 01:55:56.966]  61662.
[01:55:57.726 --> 01:55:57.906]  Yeah?
[01:55:57.926 --> 01:56:04.148]  I asked Benny Thomas, is he going to get rid of the Patriot Gag 1, 2, and 3?
[01:56:05.468 --> 01:56:10.070]  His people said, well, he doesn't have the power yet, but maybe he'll think about it.
[01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:12.470]  No, that's not something he's thinking about.
[01:56:12.610 --> 01:56:13.291]  It's like Pelosi.
[01:56:13.551 --> 01:56:21.333]  Maybe, you know, the people want it, the CIA's own assessment says we're making Iraq worse, and once the Democrats answer, we're going to increase the troops.
[01:56:22.259 --> 01:56:22.639]  Yeah!
[01:56:22.879 --> 01:56:24.500]  We're going to look at his plan.
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.301]  What plan?
[01:56:26.341 --> 01:56:27.181]  He's never had one.
[01:56:27.421 --> 01:56:28.782]  That was your campaign slogan.
[01:56:29.122 --> 01:56:31.823]  This man never had a plan, but all of a sudden you're going to look at it.
[01:56:32.963 --> 01:56:45.008]  This just behooves me that the country... Look, anybody you're hearing about, anybody, Hillary, Obama, Jeb Bush, I mean, give me a break.
[01:56:45.968 --> 01:56:47.249]  He's running around the country.
[01:56:48.550 --> 01:56:51.771]  Newt Gingrich saying get rid of the First Amendment, he's going to run for president.
[01:56:51.791 --> 01:56:53.032]  I mean, they're all bad.
[01:56:53.092 --> 01:56:55.093]  Whoever they stick out in front of us is going to be bad.
[01:56:55.953 --> 01:56:58.414]  And how did Governor Perry win again?
[01:56:58.434 --> 01:57:00.355]  I did not understand that election.
[01:57:00.435 --> 01:57:03.656]  Well, they had so many people running and there was a lot of election fraud.
[01:57:04.116 --> 01:57:05.697]  The guy was wildly unpopular.
[01:57:05.757 --> 01:57:11.059]  He would have lost if it had been a straight up, you know, if he was running against just one candidate.
[01:57:12.719 --> 01:57:15.980]  Okay, I wanted to ask you about...
[01:57:19.287 --> 01:57:22.748]  Oh, did you really think that was Saddam being hung?
[01:57:24.008 --> 01:57:25.649]  Well, that's a complex question.
[01:57:26.069 --> 01:57:44.314]  A lot of people look at the image of the Saddam we saw during the invasion, which obviously was one of his many doubles, and he admittedly had eight or nine of them at any one time, but I've watched a lot of old videos of Saddam when he was younger and skinnier, and the eyes and the nose and a lot of it, it did look like
[01:57:44.964 --> 01:57:45.945]  Saddam Hussein.
[01:57:46.565 --> 01:57:51.128]  And I really don't think they'd want to keep somebody like him around and stage his death.
[01:57:51.168 --> 01:57:56.251]  We know he broke with the New World Order, with the globalists, in 1991.
[01:57:56.732 --> 01:57:59.714]  But, you know, that's the problem.
[01:58:00.654 --> 01:58:06.498]  When the government and the media lies so much and stages so many things in the past we've caught, I don't know, Kim.
[01:58:06.518 --> 01:58:08.199]  That's a problem.
[01:58:08.239 --> 01:58:12.362]  You know, we know the government's run by a pack of criminal liars, but a lot of times we don't know what the truth is.
[01:58:13.143 --> 01:58:13.483]  Yes.
[01:58:13.983 --> 01:58:17.065]  And so, uh, but my gut tells me that was real.
[01:58:17.825 --> 01:58:19.886]  And my gut tells me that was Saddam Hussein.
[01:58:19.946 --> 01:58:21.847]  And my gut's never been wrong.
[01:58:23.108 --> 01:58:33.273]  And Alex, let people know, no matter how much insurgency we put out there, no matter how many more people, American people die, nothing's going to change.
[01:58:33.593 --> 01:58:38.836]  It's not going to change Iraq, whether it's their religion, belief, or just their culture.
[01:58:39.437 --> 01:58:40.458]  You're not going to change it.
[01:58:40.958 --> 01:58:43.420]  Well, look, Kevin, I appreciate your call.
[01:58:44.220 --> 01:58:46.041]  The globalists knew the strategy.
[01:58:46.482 --> 01:58:50.144]  They knew how to punch the buttons and how to get everybody killing each other.
[01:58:51.565 --> 01:58:58.109]  And that's why they went in and disbanded the military and disbanded the internal security apparatchik day one.
[01:58:58.750 --> 01:59:02.292]  And every expert on the outside said, why are you doing that?
[01:59:02.312 --> 01:59:03.373]  It's going to make it blow up.
[01:59:03.813 --> 01:59:05.614]  That's why they had to fire so many generals.
[01:59:06.455 --> 01:59:08.216]  The generals wanted to do the right thing, too.
[01:59:09.381 --> 01:59:11.083]  It's designed to be a quagmire.
[01:59:11.944 --> 01:59:16.589]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.

[02:00:21.667 --> 02:00:23.549]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:24.049 --> 02:00:26.912]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:33.357 --> 02:00:34.038]  Big Brother.
[02:00:34.678 --> 02:00:35.759]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:37.560]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:38.201 --> 02:00:39.022]  You want answers?
[02:00:39.782 --> 02:00:40.703]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:40.723 --> 02:00:44.987]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:45.527 --> 02:00:49.631]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:51.022 --> 02:00:58.364]  Don't forget, we have a free podcast for the entire three hours at the end of the show every day.
[02:00:58.404 --> 02:01:01.265]  If you're a subscriber to it, you just click on it and subscribe to it.
[02:01:01.285 --> 02:01:04.786]  It's free at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:01:05.327 --> 02:01:07.927]  And then it will download to your MP3 player or your iPod.

[02:01:19.514 --> 02:01:23.436]  Who is on the internet or does use an iPod that they can listen to the show.
[02:01:24.797 --> 02:01:25.537]  We're paying for it.
[02:01:25.577 --> 02:01:25.978]  It's free.
[02:01:26.078 --> 02:01:27.198]  We just want to get the word out.
[02:01:27.338 --> 02:01:30.180]  That's our currency here is waking people up.
[02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:35.363]  That's waking people up, unlocking minds, getting one step closer to defeating the New World Order.
[02:01:36.183 --> 02:01:39.105]  It's like rubies and diamonds and emeralds in my hand.
[02:01:40.446 --> 02:01:41.266]  I literally love it.
[02:01:41.286 --> 02:01:42.127]  That's what I'm after.
[02:01:42.167 --> 02:01:42.907]  That's what I love.
[02:01:44.908 --> 02:01:45.569]  And I'm committed.
[02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:47.510]  I mean, I'm not doing this and working this hard.
[02:01:49.016 --> 02:01:49.636]  To lose.
[02:01:50.136 --> 02:01:59.479]  I'm doing everything I'm doing here today because I know that with God's help we can bring these evil people to justice.
[02:01:59.519 --> 02:02:03.200]  And I'm so angry at the phony churches telling everybody to go to sleep or we're all going to be raptured.
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:07.481]  Even if that was the case, we have a duty to stand up against evil.
[02:02:08.682 --> 02:02:12.943]  And I'm tired of people standing by and letting the weak and the meek
[02:02:13.795 --> 02:02:17.418]  The women and children, especially of this world, will be abused by the New World Order.
[02:02:17.558 --> 02:02:18.839]  They're doing really bad things.
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:20.801]  And we can change it.
[02:02:21.962 --> 02:02:29.968]  You know, with slavery, in around 1800, in England, people started speaking out against the transatlantic slave trade.
[02:02:30.769 --> 02:02:35.853]  And they were called demons, they were called kooks, they were laughed at, you'll never defeat it, you'll never stop it.
[02:02:37.515 --> 02:02:42.599]  And within just a few decades, they were the majority view, and everyone agreed that it should be outlawed.
[02:02:43.146 --> 02:02:49.011]  And then it took another 50-something years for it to be attacked here.
[02:02:49.551 --> 02:02:58.938]  The problem is that you already had indentured white servants, you already had sharecroppers, you already had an underclass system, and that's what power wants.
[02:02:58.998 --> 02:02:59.859]  It wants slaves.
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:02.721]  And we're going back into slavery.
[02:03:02.761 --> 02:03:04.502]  It's just a softer form of slavery.
[02:03:05.963 --> 02:03:09.106]  It's a more subtle, refined system.
[02:03:10.621 --> 02:03:15.222]  And in my breast beats a desire to see justice done.
[02:03:16.163 --> 02:03:19.584]  Beats a desire to see bad people punished.
[02:03:21.444 --> 02:03:25.585]  And I know that none of us are safe in this current climate.
[02:03:26.646 --> 02:03:28.586]  My whole family is in grave danger.
[02:03:29.667 --> 02:03:31.287]  Your family is in grave danger.
[02:03:32.567 --> 02:03:36.389]  With the people running the planet that we have in control right now, we're all in danger.
[02:03:36.929 --> 02:03:37.909]  And that's why I'm here.
[02:03:39.102 --> 02:03:41.343]  So I do want to thank all of our AM and FM affiliates.
[02:03:42.183 --> 02:03:44.644]  I want to thank the Shoreline affiliate, WWCR.
[02:03:44.664 --> 02:03:47.464]  I want to thank the fine folks at the Genesis Network.
[02:03:47.504 --> 02:03:49.385]  I want to thank you, the listeners, the sponsors.
[02:03:50.405 --> 02:03:51.445]  I want to thank everyone.
[02:03:52.606 --> 02:03:57.147]  And my great regret in life is that I'm not the best at this job.
[02:03:58.247 --> 02:04:00.428]  And I've got plenty of problems and foibles.
[02:04:02.028 --> 02:04:04.309]  And I do plenty of things that are wrong to people.
[02:04:05.489 --> 02:04:08.150]  But I know you listen because in your gut,
[02:04:09.486 --> 02:04:13.128]  We have a connection and you know that I'm sincere.
[02:04:14.769 --> 02:04:18.091]  And you've checked out a lot of my claims and you found out they're true.
[02:04:19.392 --> 02:04:23.534]  And I want you all to know that I see you as my brothers and sisters.
[02:04:25.855 --> 02:04:32.359]  And I am humbled every day to think about the fact that
[02:04:34.145 --> 02:05:00.825]  In all the paths I could have taken in my life growing up and the experiences I had, the bad things that happened to me growing up, the evil things I saw, and some of the bad things I was involved in, that was really God preparing me to not be a fool and to not be naive and to be able to recognize the world we live in and the things that are happening around us.
[02:05:07.336 --> 02:05:08.197]  affect change.
[02:05:09.137 --> 02:05:10.678]  You're only alive once.
[02:05:12.279 --> 02:05:21.163]  And I want to encourage you to take that first step in that journey towards standing up against corruption and evil.
[02:05:22.063 --> 02:05:24.985]  We'll be right back with our esteemed guests.
[02:05:32.185 --> 02:05:37.652]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:05:38.012 --> 02:05:45.682]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:46.354 --> 02:05:53.417]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:53.797 --> 02:06:05.221]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:06:05.541 --> 02:06:09.483]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:06:09.503 --> 02:06:11.443]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:06:11.763 --> 02:06:15.605]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[02:06:16.205 --> 02:06:31.510]  Get your copy today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv The War on Terrorism.
[02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:34.611]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:06:34.891 --> 02:06:39.033]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:06:39.453 --> 02:06:40.293]  So what do you do?
[02:06:40.613 --> 02:06:45.175]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:06:45.675 --> 02:06:47.796]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:06:48.276 --> 02:07:02.982]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:07:03.022 --> 02:07:10.085]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:07:10.425 --> 02:07:14.827]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:07:15.267 --> 02:07:19.568]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:07:19.608 --> 02:07:22.349]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:07:22.649 --> 02:07:26.571]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:07:28.692 --> 02:07:31.092]  Attention, attention everyone!
[02:07:31.172 --> 02:07:33.653]  A brand new invention just released.
[02:07:33.713 --> 02:07:38.415]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[02:07:39.076 --> 02:07:45.878]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[02:07:46.418 --> 02:07:59.283]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[02:07:59.763 --> 02:08:00.623]  Wristease is perfect
[02:08:00.623 --> 02:08:00.883]  I think so.
[02:08:29.574 --> 02:08:35.177]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:37.799 --> 02:08:46.404]  I've got a New York Times report from a couple days ago concerning the new, quote, fringe economy.
[02:08:47.644 --> 02:08:49.585]  I would call it the predatory economy.
[02:08:51.626 --> 02:08:56.029]  Growth in the economy is in prisons, is in homeland security, is in law enforcement,
[02:08:56.867 --> 02:09:03.996]  ...is in short-term loans, pawn shops, check cashing places, you know, loans on your tax return.
[02:09:04.016 --> 02:09:05.198]  The country's unraveling.
[02:09:06.459 --> 02:09:09.844]  And the system is getting hungrier and hungrier.
[02:09:10.885 --> 02:09:15.330]  State tuitions at state colleges that I've looked at the ballot sheets of, like UT,
[02:09:17.108 --> 02:09:22.632]  Has 36 billion, I kept saying 24 billion, that was like a 10 year old number, I've got the new ones.
[02:09:23.733 --> 02:09:26.015]  36 billion in cream assets.
[02:09:26.615 --> 02:09:28.957]  That's not in pension funds, that's not even in investments.
[02:09:28.977 --> 02:09:32.920]  It's just in liquid cash accounts, but they're boosting tuition again.
[02:09:32.940 --> 02:09:35.542]  And I don't even know why I'm going off on this rant.
[02:09:35.662 --> 02:09:40.226]  It's just another thing I was thinking about this morning before I came in to do the show.
[02:09:42.193 --> 02:09:43.914]  Just how predatory it is.
[02:09:43.994 --> 02:09:51.399]  I mean, we've always had organizing forces in government and humanity, but a lot of times they've turned out to at least be for the better.
[02:09:52.819 --> 02:09:57.682]  Now it's just... Every indicator... Folks, I have like ten articles in my stack, okay?
[02:09:58.603 --> 02:09:59.924]  I printed last night and this morning.
[02:10:00.984 --> 02:10:04.607]  Where, again, a four-year-old hugs their teacher, they're arrested.
[02:10:04.707 --> 02:10:05.967]  It's called sexual harassment.
[02:10:06.148 --> 02:10:10.010]  Or somebody brings a plastic knife in their lunchbox to
[02:10:10.948 --> 02:10:14.069]  Put cream cheese on a bagel.
[02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:15.090]  They're arrested.
[02:10:15.990 --> 02:10:16.730]  Look at this, folks.
[02:10:16.750 --> 02:10:18.851]  This is AP Today and we're going to go to our esteemed guest.
[02:10:20.092 --> 02:10:23.273]  Young girl facing charges after wetting pants.
[02:10:24.933 --> 02:10:26.374]  Folks, I have ten of these today.
[02:10:27.454 --> 02:10:28.975]  I'm not going to even read them on air.
[02:10:30.676 --> 02:10:32.136]  I'm scared for my children.
[02:10:32.156 --> 02:10:33.297]  They're good children.
[02:10:34.137 --> 02:10:36.098]  But they may get in a fist fight sometime.
[02:10:36.138 --> 02:10:36.478]  They may
[02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:40.552]  Be sick or wet their pants sometime.
[02:10:40.632 --> 02:10:41.873]  Something might happen with them.
[02:10:42.513 --> 02:10:43.714]  And then they're gone, folks.
[02:10:43.754 --> 02:10:44.534]  They're in the system.
[02:10:45.515 --> 02:10:45.935]  Look at this.
[02:10:45.975 --> 02:10:47.596]  This is out of Danville, PA.
[02:10:47.616 --> 02:10:50.197]  A 12-year-old special education student.
[02:10:50.918 --> 02:10:51.618]  And it goes on.
[02:10:51.638 --> 02:10:52.599]  They're mildly retarded.
[02:10:52.619 --> 02:10:54.980]  So now 12-year-old retarded children are charged.
[02:10:55.020 --> 02:10:57.422]  See, it's a system hungry to fill more beds.
[02:10:57.442 --> 02:10:58.242]  To get more people in.
[02:10:59.183 --> 02:11:02.485]  See, citizens are worth more now in prison than they are outside.
[02:11:03.045 --> 02:11:04.866]  A 12-year-old special education student
[02:11:05.743 --> 02:11:06.303]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:11:27.330 --> 02:11:29.912]  Her mother told the press enterprise it happened because her daughter was scared.
[02:11:30.292 --> 02:11:35.776]  The girl had been preparing a holiday lunch with her classmates and teachers at Danville Middle School on December 20th.
[02:11:35.796 --> 02:11:43.021]  Her mother said when her daughter refused to go to the kitchen to wash some pots and pans, teachers summoned Principal Kevin Duckworth, who confronted the girl.
[02:11:43.641 --> 02:11:44.682]  Then she wet her pants.
[02:11:46.303 --> 02:11:47.104]  And she's retarded.
[02:11:48.485 --> 02:11:50.646]  So now they're going to criminally charge retarded children.
[02:11:50.666 --> 02:11:52.348]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[02:11:53.008 --> 02:11:55.850]  I've got literally nine more just like it.
[02:11:57.509 --> 02:12:06.337]  Children who get off school buses and go to the store to get something to drink instead of going right home, get arrested.
[02:12:06.357 --> 02:12:10.440]  I mean, it's just destroying world order.
[02:12:10.761 --> 02:12:12.983]  I could talk for hours about our guest, Bio.
[02:12:14.664 --> 02:12:23.332]  He drafted the Biological Weapons Anti-Terror Act of 89 and helped draft the UN's Anti-Biological Weapons Treaties.
[02:12:24.301 --> 02:12:29.726]  And he has worked and advised on the highest levels of the Congress and basically done it all.
[02:12:29.786 --> 02:12:33.128]  He's a doctor, professor, law expert.
[02:12:34.550 --> 02:12:35.530]  Francis A. Boyle.
[02:12:35.571 --> 02:12:36.611]  He's written a bunch of books.
[02:12:36.631 --> 02:12:39.614]  We have links to websites with his publisher and how you can get them.
[02:12:39.914 --> 02:12:41.375]  I've read Destroying World Order.
[02:12:41.415 --> 02:12:42.336]  It's an excellent book.
[02:12:43.677 --> 02:12:47.060]  And if any of us are going to be free human beings, we've got to destroy world order.
[02:12:48.561 --> 02:12:50.423]  Dr. Boyle, thanks for coming on with us today.
[02:12:51.249 --> 02:12:55.532]  Well, thanks for having me on again, and Happy New Year to all your listeners.
[02:12:56.012 --> 02:13:03.617]  Just a side issue, do you want to comment on what I was saying about a predatory system and how it's just getting crazier and crazier?
[02:13:03.637 --> 02:13:04.697]  Sure.
[02:13:04.737 --> 02:13:15.124]  We have 2.2 million Americans in prison, which is the highest rate of incarceration per capita basis in the world.
[02:13:16.004 --> 02:13:18.766]  So, in other words, as far as the power elite
[02:13:20.732 --> 02:13:22.653]  who run this country are concerned.
[02:13:23.994 --> 02:13:28.777]  We Americans are the most criminal race of people in the world.
[02:13:30.178 --> 02:13:33.080]  I don't really believe that is true at all.
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:50.250]  But basically you see a power elite run wild that instead of giving their people adequate jobs, health care, education, food, clothing,
[02:13:51.064 --> 02:13:52.585]  I don't think so.
[02:14:19.218 --> 02:14:39.479]  When we used to have a criminal justice system that was designed for the purpose not of criminalizing children, but trying to reform them, guide and supervise them.
[02:14:40.239 --> 02:14:49.844]  Starting with the Reagan administration and the neoconservatives who worked for Reagan, including Mies and many of the people we see in Washington today.
[02:14:50.905 --> 02:15:02.410]  By the way, Mies was the sort of legal mentor to Roberts and Alito, who were on the Supreme Court, and many of the other federal judges we see.
[02:15:03.391 --> 02:15:05.492]  They began to criminalize children.
[02:15:06.392 --> 02:15:08.954]  And instead of treating them as children, treated them as adults.
[02:15:10.151 --> 02:15:12.692]  Uh, proceeded to, uh, to prosecute them.
[02:15:13.092 --> 02:15:13.892]  Stick them away.
[02:15:14.852 --> 02:15:19.013]  Uh, rather than guide them, help them, if necessary, reform them.
[02:15:19.193 --> 02:15:22.034]  And they sold it on things that sounded reasonable at first.
[02:15:22.054 --> 02:15:22.854]  You know, the litmus test.
[02:15:22.914 --> 02:15:24.675]  Oh, we're just taking the Nazis' free speech.
[02:15:25.015 --> 02:15:26.075]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[02:15:26.635 --> 02:15:28.876]  Oh, a 14-year-old shot his parents.
[02:15:28.896 --> 02:15:35.917]  He deserves, you know, to do... Well, yes, that person does deserve, if they've got mental faculties, you know, that is a serious crime.
[02:15:35.957 --> 02:15:36.897]  That is an adult crime.
[02:15:36.937 --> 02:15:38.998]  But now it's having a plastic
[02:15:39.822 --> 02:16:07.670]  uh... dixie knife in your for your cream cheese uh... and you know it doesn't matter if you're on the honor roll we're going to take it i mean it's just uh... again this is the and it's seven plus million in the system millions behind bars i i i i'm sorry i've made you digress a bit tired out there is uh... uh... the international convention on the rights of the child with rights of uh... uh... every government country in the world is a party to it
[02:16:08.804 --> 02:16:13.145]  Except the United States and Somalia, and Somalia doesn't have a government.
[02:16:13.605 --> 02:16:18.326]  Of course, we don't have a government either that is in the interest of the American people.
[02:16:18.907 --> 02:16:25.088]  But if you read that convention, it sets out what everyone in the world believes are the basic human rights of children.
[02:16:26.008 --> 02:16:32.630]  And one of their basic human rights is not to be subjected to the adult
[02:16:33.212 --> 02:17:02.263]  System of criminal justice that their children are defined as human beings under the age of 18 So if you really want to see what is the standard for the entire rest of the world except the United States of Somalia You can access that convention online All right, let's let's let's shift back into but I mean I think it's important to set the table on the top of the atmosphere We're in destroying world order
[02:17:03.218 --> 02:17:03.458]  U.S.
[02:17:03.518 --> 02:17:05.860]  imperialism in the Middle East before September 11th.
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:08.161]  And then I want to... Well, you know what?
[02:17:08.181 --> 02:17:09.382]  Let's start out with Saddam.
[02:17:09.862 --> 02:17:12.524]  Because this is really blown up in their face.
[02:17:12.944 --> 02:17:14.445]  Give us your analysis on it, doctor.
[02:17:16.206 --> 02:17:16.926]  Yes.
[02:17:17.226 --> 02:17:25.231]  We have to understand that this entire show trial was organized directly out of the White House.
[02:17:25.651 --> 02:17:32.295]  It had already been reported, even in the New York Times, that there was a lawyer on the White House staff
[02:17:32.694 --> 02:17:35.095]  Who was in charge of running the whole thing.
[02:17:35.175 --> 02:17:40.637]  I can't recall the guy's name, but it's there in the database, LexisNexis, somewhere.
[02:17:41.317 --> 02:17:50.301]  So, for example, the death penalty for him came down just before the November elections.
[02:17:51.841 --> 02:18:01.905]  The execution itself, the hanging, lynching, I don't know what else you'd call it, was designed for political reasons.
[02:18:02.891 --> 02:18:10.179]  His execution, under these circumstances, violated the Third Geneva Convention of 1949.
[02:18:12.202 --> 02:18:23.154]  We had originally designated him as a prisoner of war, which the convention prohibited setting up this kangaroo court proceeding.
[02:18:23.757 --> 02:18:25.878]  That was run out of the White House.
[02:18:25.958 --> 02:18:30.579]  I mean, even the state-appointed judges kept quitting and they killed a bunch of Saddam's lawyers out in the street.
[02:18:30.679 --> 02:18:33.100]  I mean, this was a complete joke.
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:35.060]  People said, well, he doesn't deserve a fair trial.
[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:42.863]  The point is, the facts come out, and it would have come out, how our government helped him and advised him in many of the, quote, crimes he committed.
[02:18:43.383 --> 02:18:45.963]  Well, that's right, and that's why it was set up this way.
[02:18:45.983 --> 02:18:50.045]  The first trial, Dujail, this massacre of Shias, 140 or so,
[02:18:51.946 --> 02:18:58.831]  Back in 1982, before we really were involved in any of his major atrocities.
[02:18:58.931 --> 02:19:02.333]  Although we did encourage him to invade Iran.
[02:19:02.634 --> 02:19:07.177]  They did that little one because that was something that was compartmentalized and didn't touch the White House.
[02:19:07.637 --> 02:19:08.338]  That's correct.
[02:19:08.418 --> 02:19:13.661]  And he was now on trial for his atrocities against the Kurds, including the gassing.
[02:19:14.522 --> 02:19:19.926]  And that clearly did get into our complicity in helping provide him with both
[02:19:20.481 --> 02:19:22.302]  Chemical and biological weapons.
[02:19:23.023 --> 02:19:31.109]  And so it was in our interest to kill him off before that trial went forward or any of the other trials.
[02:19:31.750 --> 02:19:36.613]  But we have to look at it from a broader perspective.
[02:19:36.674 --> 02:19:41.097]  I said there was a lawyer directly out of the White House running this whole show.
[02:19:41.117 --> 02:19:43.539]  It was all paid for by the United States government.
[02:19:43.699 --> 02:19:44.700]  All the investigators.
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:47.642]  They had an army of 20 lawyers over there running this thing.
[02:19:48.211 --> 02:20:01.203]  And it was basically a combination of kangaroo court and a Stalinist show trial, and it clearly was going to lead to this execution at a time that was propitious for the Bush people.
[02:20:01.343 --> 02:20:03.425]  Now let's look at the timing here.
[02:20:04.707 --> 02:20:08.931]  First we had coming up the 3,000th dead U.S.
[02:20:09.011 --> 02:20:10.272]  soldier in Iraq.
[02:20:11.235 --> 02:20:17.120]  And executing Saddam Hussein was a good way to try to get that out of the press.
[02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:24.327]  Dr. Francis Boyle, a global legal expert, advisor to Congress, writer of different conventions.
[02:20:24.727 --> 02:20:26.108]  We'll come right back to him after the break.
[02:20:26.128 --> 02:20:26.669]  Please stay with us.
[02:20:29.292 --> 02:20:37.640]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing Prudent Places USA, an interactive CD book that is your premier resource for hard-to-find information.

[02:21:29.392 --> 02:21:32.033]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:21:32.453 --> 02:21:44.717]  Did you know that those seeking to destroy America and merge us into an all-powerful one-world government said that they support every movement to centralize all authority in Washington, D.C., and therefore bypass the state governments?
[02:21:45.635 --> 02:21:49.318]  That way they would have only one battle to win, Washington, D.C.
[02:21:50.158 --> 02:21:56.323]  Have we witnessed the accumulation of power in Washington and bypassing the states over the last 50 years?
[02:21:56.943 --> 02:22:04.609]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:22:25.740 --> 02:22:26.180]  Gold.
[02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:27.801]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:22:28.061 --> 02:22:34.164]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:22:34.344 --> 02:22:38.166]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:22:38.526 --> 02:22:40.407]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:22:40.447 --> 02:22:42.708]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:22:43.288 --> 02:22:44.229]  We're good to go.
[02:23:07.972 --> 02:23:08.312]  Thank you.
[02:23:25.078 --> 02:23:27.799]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[02:23:28.179 --> 02:23:34.662]  Since January of 2006, RxDrugCard.com members have saved an average of $33 per prescription fill.
[02:23:34.682 --> 02:23:36.643]  That's over 46% savings!
[02:23:37.023 --> 02:23:39.304]  The average savings for generic drugs was over 71%.
[02:23:41.185 --> 02:23:49.595]  RxDrugCard.com is the only major discount prescription drug plan that offers a price lookup page, so you can get an idea of your discounted price before you enroll.
[02:23:49.916 --> 02:23:53.199]  RxDrugCard.com is for anyone who pays for their own prescriptions.

[02:23:57.424 --> 02:23:57.724]  I think so.
[02:24:32.998 --> 02:24:36.361]  Dr. Francis A. Boyle, author of Destroying World Order U.S.
[02:24:36.441 --> 02:24:40.464]  Imperialism in the Middle East before and after September 11th, joins us.
[02:24:40.484 --> 02:24:42.866]  We'll tell you more about his books and how to get them before he leaves us.
[02:24:42.886 --> 02:24:45.869]  We'll take a few calls before the show ends in about 36 minutes.
[02:24:45.889 --> 02:24:55.917]  Dr. Boyle, please continue with where you left off with the lynching, the getting rid of the guy who knew too many secrets over the weekend.
[02:24:56.517 --> 02:24:56.678]  Right.
[02:24:56.718 --> 02:25:01.962]  We also have to look at the timing and obviously the death of the three
[02:25:02.969 --> 02:25:07.633]  3,000th soldier, US soldier in Iraq was coming up right at that time.
[02:25:08.994 --> 02:25:16.360]  So I believe that this was orchestrated to distract public attention and focus from that 3,000th death.
[02:25:16.540 --> 02:25:29.771]  And let me say, these US soldiers in Iraq, they're our mothers and our fathers, our brothers and our sisters, our sons and our daughters.
[02:25:30.606 --> 02:25:38.871]  And they are being needlessly murdered by Bush and his neoconservative criminal cabal.
[02:25:39.772 --> 02:25:48.297]  And it is up to each and every one of us as US citizens to get them home as soon as possible.
[02:25:49.577 --> 02:26:00.204]  Now, that being said, there is the additional factor here of the animosity, deliberately stirring up animosity,
[02:26:01.184 --> 02:26:08.713]  Between the Shia and the Sunni, which this lynching was also designed to do.
[02:26:09.093 --> 02:26:12.658]  Do you think they intended for Saddam to blow up and respond to the taunts?
[02:26:12.718 --> 02:26:16.001]  I mean, obviously that was all carefully choreographed and staged.
[02:26:16.102 --> 02:26:19.726]  Could it have blown up in the White House's face any bigger?
[02:26:21.403 --> 02:26:24.586]  Well, I think this is what they wanted to happen.
[02:26:24.646 --> 02:26:26.668]  I don't think it has blown up in their face.
[02:26:26.688 --> 02:26:29.830]  You have to understand the, um... They want more military in the U.S.
[02:26:30.091 --> 02:26:30.571]  That's correct.
[02:26:30.591 --> 02:26:32.893]  The neoconservative mentality.
[02:26:33.193 --> 02:26:35.615]  As I said, this is all run right out of the White House.
[02:26:36.696 --> 02:26:40.539]  Hadley is a neoconservative graduate of the Yale Law School.
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:42.281]  By the way, you went to school with these people.
[02:26:42.321 --> 02:26:42.761]  You know them.
[02:26:43.442 --> 02:26:44.002]  That's correct.
[02:26:44.903 --> 02:26:47.886]  I was trained at the University of Chicago, sort of this
[02:26:48.604 --> 02:26:51.766]  Neoconservative Seth Poole as an undergrad.
[02:26:51.826 --> 02:26:55.189]  I was there with Wolfowitz, Sholsky, all these people.
[02:26:56.189 --> 02:27:02.193]  And then his deputy, Elliot Abrams, Hadley's deputy, Elliot Abrams, another neoconservative.
[02:27:02.434 --> 02:27:04.175]  I went to Harvard Law School with him.
[02:27:04.975 --> 02:27:10.899]  Abrams had murdered 35,000 people down in Nicaragua back in the 1980s.
[02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:14.362]  And I say murder, I was down there to see what he did.
[02:27:15.947 --> 02:27:17.628]  And Bush hired him on.
[02:27:17.648 --> 02:27:20.009]  He's now the Deputy National Security Advisor.
[02:27:21.370 --> 02:27:28.333]  Abrams is a neoconservative affiliated with the Likud party in Israel.
[02:27:28.753 --> 02:27:33.956]  Eros Sharon and all these racist and genocidal fanatics.
[02:27:34.776 --> 02:27:43.620]  So my assessment was that Abrams and Hadley gave the green light
[02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:56.478]  deliberately to stir up sectarian tensions, not only in Iraq, between the Shia and the Sunni, but also in the Muslim world.
[02:27:56.498 --> 02:28:09.768]  So they picked the holiest day, Eid al-Adha, which commemorates the feast of the sacrifice where God
[02:28:10.757 --> 02:28:10.957]  Right.
[02:28:11.017 --> 02:28:20.342]  Well, God told Abraham that he did not have to sacrifice Isaac, but gave him a goat instead.
[02:28:20.682 --> 02:28:27.025]  So this is probably the holiest day on the Muslim calendar.
[02:28:27.565 --> 02:28:33.868]  And I'm sure a guy like Abrams, who knows a lot about the Middle East, knew that so well.
[02:28:34.509 --> 02:28:37.090]  And they gave the go-ahead to lynching
[02:28:38.258 --> 02:28:49.844]  On the Holiest Day in the Muslim world, knowing full well it would stir up tensions between the Shia and the Muslims, and also worldwide.
[02:28:49.884 --> 02:28:59.608]  If you look at the wire services today, you'll see that they have now turned Saddam Hussein into a martyr.
[02:29:00.969 --> 02:29:06.672]  Now, I've done a lot of work in the Arab and Muslim world, and prior to this, everyone I knew just
[02:29:07.509 --> 02:29:09.651]  Saddam Hussein was pretty much a butcher.
[02:29:10.351 --> 02:29:20.161]  But now they've turned him into a martyr, and this is fine as far as the neoconservative mentality is concerned.
[02:29:20.441 --> 02:29:30.932]  It was the same philosophy the United States had in the Iraq-Iran War, as Henry Kissinger said, we want them all to kill each other off.
[02:29:31.596 --> 02:29:37.281]  Well, actually, Zbigniew Brzezinski is now calling it the Global Balkans, the Strategy of Tension.
[02:29:38.182 --> 02:29:59.760]  Well, that's right, and at Harvard, I went through the same PhD program that produced both Kissinger and Brzezinski, and indeed, they gave me Kissinger's old office at the Center for International Affairs, and in fact, we had the same international relations teacher, Hans Morgenthau.
[02:30:00.723 --> 02:30:10.705]  And, uh, when I was 21 years old, uh, Morgenthau offered to, uh, call up Kissinger and get me a job on his White House staff, which I declined.
[02:30:11.065 --> 02:30:11.425]  Amazing.
[02:30:11.445 --> 02:30:12.965]  I want to hear, yeah, the backstory.
[02:30:12.985 --> 02:30:13.886]  You know these guys.
[02:30:14.786 --> 02:30:17.646]  And, uh, I want to see what their, you know, their final endgame is.
[02:30:19.367 --> 02:30:20.327]  We're on the march.
[02:30:20.767 --> 02:30:22.407]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:22.427 --> 02:30:25.968]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:31.147 --> 02:30:35.251]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:30:35.492 --> 02:30:37.253]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:30:37.514 --> 02:30:43.800]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:30:44.100 --> 02:30:50.227]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:30:50.487 --> 02:30:52.309]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:30:52.589 --> 02:30:53.010]  I think so.
[02:31:07.469 --> 02:31:10.110]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:31:35.774 --> 02:31:40.598]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:31:40.818 --> 02:31:43.560]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:31:43.600 --> 02:31:44.701]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:31:46.042 --> 02:31:50.646]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:31:51.587 --> 02:31:58.833]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:31:59.833 --> 02:32:02.896]  Midas Resources is offering the red buck and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[02:32:05.046 --> 02:32:08.489]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:32:09.470 --> 02:32:10.771]  Call for your copy today.
[02:32:10.991 --> 02:32:13.193]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:32:14.254 --> 02:32:20.099]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:32:20.740 --> 02:32:20.880]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:32:20.900 --> 02:32:21.180]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:32:28.840 --> 02:32:31.203]  Attention, attention everyone!
[02:32:31.223 --> 02:32:33.766]  A brand new invention just released.
[02:32:33.846 --> 02:32:38.552]  It's called Wristease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[02:32:39.213 --> 02:32:46.019]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:59.451]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[02:32:59.892 --> 02:33:00.432]  Wristease has
[02:33:00.452 --> 02:33:03.873]  It's perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[02:33:04.313 --> 02:33:14.397]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[02:33:14.777 --> 02:33:17.798]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[02:33:18.178 --> 02:33:19.418]  That's Wristease.
[02:33:19.838 --> 02:33:24.800]  W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E Wristease.com.
[02:33:24.940 --> 02:33:27.541]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[02:33:38.965 --> 02:33:41.887]  Hey, we just had somebody run a hack!
[02:34:09.441 --> 02:34:18.607]  They went in and took our big sponsor for fish oil at the top and turned it into a huge banner for Jones Report.
[02:34:19.988 --> 02:34:24.291]  I guess it's better than a couple years ago when they posted some naked lady on a motorcycle on our main page.
[02:34:24.832 --> 02:34:26.052]  Very funny guys!
[02:34:27.233 --> 02:34:31.956]  And you must really know what you're doing to be able to get through all of our defenses and do that.
[02:34:31.977 --> 02:34:33.978]  That's it, I'll launch a whole other website because you did that.
[02:34:34.887 --> 02:34:36.227]  Boy, I tell you, it's crazy.
[02:34:36.307 --> 02:34:42.749]  I know that we have callers for our guests, and I tell you, I really appreciate him spending time with us today.
[02:34:42.789 --> 02:34:46.029]  Destroying World Order is the one book he's written that I've read.
[02:34:46.089 --> 02:34:50.270]  I've scanned through the other one on the anthrax attacks.
[02:34:50.810 --> 02:34:59.272]  Of course, we had him on about three or four weeks ago, and the story went supernova on the web concerning the clear evidence of government involvement in the anthrax attacks.
[02:34:59.332 --> 02:35:00.312]  It's an orgy of evidence.
[02:35:00.968 --> 02:35:02.689]  Before he leaves us, we'll tell you how to get these books.
[02:35:03.009 --> 02:35:09.250]  We have links to his publisher and the websites up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:35:10.331 --> 02:35:11.391]  But let me elaborate.
[02:35:11.611 --> 02:35:17.333]  I tell the listeners, because I'm going off the 83 Israeli plan, the 2002 US plan, I'm not that smart.
[02:35:17.493 --> 02:35:21.774]  They admit in policy papers what they're really going to do, and then they have their public propaganda, as you know, Doctor.
[02:35:22.483 --> 02:35:31.272]  They said, we're going to go in, break Iraq in three parts, and spread revolution and civil war into the rest of the region, weaken all these countries, not let them become first world.
[02:35:31.772 --> 02:35:34.155]  We may even overthrow Saudi Arabia, blah, blah, blah.
[02:35:34.715 --> 02:35:38.059]  And so I understand that they did this to make everybody get mad.
[02:35:38.159 --> 02:35:40.061]  I know the military was running the whole execution.
[02:35:40.101 --> 02:35:40.741]  That's admitted.
[02:35:41.102 --> 02:35:42.203]  Now they're out lying about it.
[02:35:42.788 --> 02:35:46.857]  But when I say blow up in their face, it seems like they're overcooking it.
[02:35:47.839 --> 02:35:50.906]  It's like they're baking a cake in the Middle East, but like they've burned the cake.
[02:35:51.427 --> 02:35:52.810]  The violence is so bad.
[02:35:53.748 --> 02:35:55.149]  The troops are barely hanging on.
[02:35:55.169 --> 02:35:58.972]  I guess they see it as shooting the moon, as a guest said on the show yesterday.
[02:35:59.453 --> 02:36:05.297]  Kind of going for it all with a Hail Mary, trying to escalate us into something even bigger.
[02:36:05.898 --> 02:36:10.541]  But it just seems like their humorous has got to get the best of them sometime.
[02:36:10.581 --> 02:36:13.243]  I mean, 78% of Americans now in major polls want out.
[02:36:13.503 --> 02:36:14.104]  70% of the troops.
[02:36:14.865 --> 02:36:18.007]  There are people protesting with Democrats every time they have a press conference.
[02:36:18.307 --> 02:36:19.108]  We have a clip of that.
[02:36:19.708 --> 02:36:23.150]  I mean, just how far, how much are they going to get away with, Doctor?
[02:36:49.662 --> 02:36:50.022]  War.
[02:36:50.262 --> 02:36:50.863]  Massacre.
[02:36:50.883 --> 02:36:52.463]  Call it what you want against Lebanon.
[02:36:53.264 --> 02:36:56.545]  Israel's war massacre against Palestinians both this summer.
[02:36:57.305 --> 02:37:00.987]  And now they're planning for a war against Iran.
[02:37:01.007 --> 02:37:03.528]  A bombing campaign.
[02:37:03.668 --> 02:37:07.610]  That very well could turn into World War III.
[02:37:08.010 --> 02:37:11.631]  And that would not bother them at all, these neoconservatives.
[02:37:12.132 --> 02:37:14.693]  From their perspective, how else are they going to
[02:37:15.774 --> 02:37:16.855]  Retreat the situation.
[02:37:17.155 --> 02:37:25.019]  Well, neocons are on talk radio saying there's going to be World War III, and then they're going to start arresting all the, quote, American Al-Qaeda.
[02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:30.062]  That's you and I, who are against this war, when they're really Al-Cieda.
[02:37:30.362 --> 02:37:31.523]  They're the ones behind it all.
[02:37:32.244 --> 02:37:35.906]  I'm sure you're aware of the fact that Gingrich is calling for shutting down the First Amendment.
[02:37:36.826 --> 02:37:39.208]  I mean, they are going for broke, I guess.
[02:37:39.428 --> 02:37:39.768]  They are.
[02:37:40.088 --> 02:37:44.030]  And you have to understand the neocon mentality.
[02:37:44.110 --> 02:37:44.751]  As I was saying,
[02:37:45.674 --> 02:37:48.895]  I went to the University of Chicago, the home of the neocons.
[02:37:48.995 --> 02:37:52.896]  I entered there in 1968 as an undergraduate.
[02:37:53.876 --> 02:38:11.822]  Their founder, Leo Strauss, had just retired from the political science department, but I was trained by his foremost student, protege, co-author, and later literary executor, Joseph Propst.
[02:38:12.808 --> 02:38:17.972]  So I went right through the entire neocon program there at the University of Chicago.
[02:38:18.792 --> 02:38:27.398]  Wolfowitz was there getting his PhD in International Relations, which I studied, as I said, under Hans Mugenthal.
[02:38:28.319 --> 02:38:31.661]  Ashcroft was there getting his law degree.
[02:38:33.423 --> 02:38:38.046]  Many of the other neocons, Kaluzdad was there, Shilsky, they were all there.
[02:38:38.903 --> 02:38:43.165]  And we have to understand the neocon mentality.
[02:38:43.285 --> 02:38:58.993]  I briefly discussed it in Destroying World Order, but basically put, Leo Strauss' mentor in Germany, before he immigrated to the United States, was Carl Schmitt.
[02:39:00.173 --> 02:39:07.897]  And Carl Schmitt went on to become the most notorious Nazi law professor
[02:39:08.507 --> 02:39:09.989]  Of that benighted error.
[02:39:10.549 --> 02:39:17.876]  Carl Schmitt justified every hideous atrocity the Nazis inflicted on anyone.
[02:39:18.037 --> 02:39:21.961]  Well, the parallels to the Bush administration and the Nazis are legion.
[02:39:22.681 --> 02:39:24.663]  And that's not an accident, is it?
[02:39:25.524 --> 02:39:27.166]  No, I'm suggesting it isn't.
[02:39:27.306 --> 02:39:31.210]  That the neocons, through Strauss,
[02:39:32.688 --> 02:39:39.171]  And there is a book, if you're interested here, Professor Shadia Drury, D-R-U-R-Y.
[02:39:39.471 --> 02:39:46.134]  She teaches up in Canada and has had no contact with the University of Chicago that I'm aware of.
[02:39:46.934 --> 02:39:56.758]  The neocons have been thoroughly schooled in Straussian and Schmittian theory, which is basically Nazi.
[02:39:57.659 --> 02:40:01.040]  And these people really are neo-Nazis.
[02:40:01.808 --> 02:40:03.192]  And we have to understand that.
[02:40:03.472 --> 02:40:09.048]  I think people have a difficult time coming to grips with it because it seems so alien.
[02:40:10.242 --> 02:40:11.222]  To our tradition.
[02:40:11.422 --> 02:40:21.164]  But it's second nature for the Trotskyites, who kind of formed up with the Bushes, who, you know, Prescott Bush was a high-level Nazi agent in the U.S.
[02:40:21.645 --> 02:40:23.325]  and helped fence a lot of them into the U.S.
[02:40:23.365 --> 02:40:27.486]  and their money, so it just seems like they're just continuing with a tradition.
[02:40:27.726 --> 02:40:33.927]  Now, what about the Democrats and Nancy Pelosi and all these others saying, hey, yeah, we're going to increase troops, yeah, we're never going to leave?
[02:40:34.807 --> 02:40:35.948]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:40:35.968 --> 02:40:37.328]  What do you say about those guys?
[02:40:39.048 --> 02:40:51.412]  Well, you know, when I was young, it was the Democrats who gave us the Vietnam War under John Kennedy, the best of the brightest in David Elberstam and the rest of the Democrats.
[02:40:51.612 --> 02:40:53.913]  So it doesn't surprise me at all.
[02:40:54.033 --> 02:40:58.034]  I mean, basically, the current Democratic Party, I'm a political independent.
[02:40:59.134 --> 02:41:03.656]  These are the sons and the daughters of the best of the brightest that gave us the Vietnam War.
[02:41:04.636 --> 02:41:06.777]  And indeed, Elberstam
[02:41:07.446 --> 02:41:16.313]  Writing on Best of the Brightest was talking about Harvard, where I spent seven years at Harvard getting three degrees after the University of Chicago.
[02:41:16.933 --> 02:41:34.707]  And again, going through this exact same program that produced Kissinger and Brzezinski, but especially Kissinger, because I wanted to be trained exactly like these people, and think like them, and know what they're up to, and then hopefully come out and turn it against them.
[02:41:36.151 --> 02:41:42.335]  What we're seeing now, and I guess you had mentioned a previous speaker, this is go for broke.
[02:41:42.475 --> 02:41:57.846]  These neo-Nazis, the neocons from Chicago, and President Bush at one point publicly bragged that he had appointed at least 20 or 25 Straussians, neocons, to his administration.
[02:41:58.326 --> 02:42:03.770]  And the whole White House and Cheney's office are occupied by neocons.
[02:42:05.686 --> 02:42:09.408]  They're going for world domination and control.
[02:42:09.869 --> 02:42:11.050]  The whole shebang here.
[02:42:11.450 --> 02:42:12.450]  And they realize it?
[02:42:12.831 --> 02:42:13.471]  They realize it?
[02:42:13.791 --> 02:42:14.212]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:42:14.732 --> 02:42:26.539]  The wars against Afghanistan and Iraq had been planned for quite some time, as you correctly pointed out, by the Israelis and also even by our own Pentagon.
[02:42:27.220 --> 02:42:35.005]  They have been executed to seize and steal at least two-thirds of the world's energy resources.
[02:42:35.868 --> 02:42:37.949]  And they plan to hold on to it.
[02:42:38.129 --> 02:42:42.131]  This is the future of the world economy right there.
[02:42:42.672 --> 02:42:43.752]  They're not going to give it up.
[02:42:44.052 --> 02:42:49.495]  Dr. Boyle, going back, you know, we know there's the old line oil companies, there's the big central banks.
[02:42:49.695 --> 02:42:56.919]  They certainly are funding and fostering the neocons and the Israelis and the British and others.
[02:42:58.340 --> 02:43:03.383]  Is there no concern by the old line elite, that basically already own the world, that this could get out of hand?
[02:43:05.345 --> 02:43:07.866]  Are you seeing any fissures in the power structure?
[02:43:08.367 --> 02:43:12.189]  Or is it just basically, we're going over the edge of the cliff?
[02:43:13.490 --> 02:43:15.871]  Well, I think they're moving towards World War III.
[02:43:16.412 --> 02:43:22.836]  And that, unfortunately, it seems the power elite have signed on to this.
[02:43:23.797 --> 02:43:25.758]  Today, if you read the New York Times,
[02:43:27.116 --> 02:43:40.759]  Brent Scowcroft, who worked for Kissinger and then became National Security Advisor to both Ford and then Bush Sr., who had originally opposed Bush Jr.'
[02:43:40.739 --> 02:43:41.899]  's war against Iraq.
[02:43:42.599 --> 02:43:50.540]  If you read today's New York Times, there's a big op-ed piece where he's basically supporting the Bush Jr.
[02:43:51.101 --> 02:43:53.381]  strategy of escalation in Iraq.
[02:43:54.252 --> 02:44:07.480]  Where the neocons are going to send over another 20,000 to 30,000 of our brothers and sisters to be massacred in Iraq.
[02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:11.723]  And then that will escalate even again, and then more troops, more troops.
[02:44:12.743 --> 02:44:16.726]  But if the American people don't want to go along with it, I guess the domestic police state
[02:44:17.481 --> 02:44:21.644]  And all this talk about restricting the First Amendment, I guess that comes into play.
[02:44:21.904 --> 02:44:27.888]  That's correct, and that's why you're seeing the police state Gestapo tactics that we talked about the last time.
[02:44:29.048 --> 02:44:35.873]  For example, Gonzales, Harvard Law School, I went there, another neocon nest.
[02:44:36.993 --> 02:44:42.517]  The head of Homeland Security turned off a certified neocon himself.
[02:44:43.354 --> 02:44:48.057]  Uh, and it's no accident that they put Chertoff in charge of the, uh, police state.
[02:44:48.217 --> 02:44:50.078]  He's running the thing, uh, right there.
[02:44:50.759 --> 02:45:06.589]  So, they understood that if they made this major grab for world power by launching brutal aggression against Iraq and Afghanistan, and perhaps now Iran if we don't stop them, and Syria,
[02:45:07.689 --> 02:45:13.775]  Uh, that there would be massive resistance by the American people as we saw opposition to the Vietnam War.
[02:45:13.815 --> 02:45:17.559]  But magically 9-11 happened as the pretext to push it all.
[02:45:18.584 --> 02:45:19.144]  That's correct.
[02:45:19.384 --> 02:45:27.307]  One, they needed a pre-tax, and then two, they need a police state to stop the predictable resistance.
[02:45:27.607 --> 02:45:29.288]  How do we stop them, Dr. Boyle?
[02:45:29.328 --> 02:45:35.350]  I mean, you've advised Congress, you've written international and national legislation, you've been to all the same schools.
[02:45:35.410 --> 02:45:39.131]  I mean, how do we stop these people from doing this?
[02:45:39.191 --> 02:45:40.832]  How do we stop World War III?
[02:45:44.358 --> 02:45:47.720]  Mrs. Cindy Sheehan the other day, right?
[02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:51.902]  And they engaged in peaceful, non-violent civil resistance.
[02:45:51.962 --> 02:45:55.544]  They disrupted that press conference by Rahm Emanuel.
[02:45:57.065 --> 02:46:03.589]  She took the podium in front of the press and she demanded troops out of Iraq.
[02:46:04.506 --> 02:46:07.629]  And, you know, we went through this before in the Vietnam War.
[02:46:07.809 --> 02:46:09.550]  But isn't this an illustration of everybody?
[02:46:10.051 --> 02:46:19.498]  That it's unconstitutional, the people don't want to be there, they lied to us to get this there, but still, we see the Democrats and Republicans circling the wagons against the people.
[02:46:19.518 --> 02:46:20.119]  But I agree.
[02:46:20.579 --> 02:46:22.601]  Everywhere they go, they should be shut down.
[02:46:23.021 --> 02:46:24.302]  They should be completely shut down.
[02:46:24.402 --> 02:46:26.084]  And I'm not advocating violence here.
[02:46:26.524 --> 02:46:33.970]  But peaceful, non-violent, civil resistance that Cindy Sheehan has been doing now for quite some time.
[02:46:34.794 --> 02:46:47.421]  Uh, and pretty much what we did to end the Vietnam War, pretty much what African Americans courageously did to produce civil rights in this country at a very high cost.
[02:46:47.781 --> 02:46:49.702]  What about the national draft?
[02:46:49.722 --> 02:46:54.845]  They've got all these big, the head of the Selective Service and everybody out pushing how important a draft is.
[02:46:55.566 --> 02:46:57.006]  They've set up the draft boards again.
[02:46:57.046 --> 02:47:01.689]  Do you think they'll try to pull a draft after another staged terror attack?
[02:47:03.515 --> 02:47:05.276]  I'm sure they're moving in that direction.
[02:47:05.896 --> 02:47:09.658]  It's very similar to what President Johnson did in December of 1964.
[02:47:12.299 --> 02:47:15.841]  We had about 140,000 troops in Vietnam.
[02:47:16.421 --> 02:47:25.546]  His advisors were telling him the war was lost, and instead of pulling out, he decided to escalate, creating a total disaster.
[02:47:27.065 --> 02:47:29.727]  58,000 men of my generation were decently killed.
[02:47:29.787 --> 02:47:33.591]  But not a disaster for the defense contractors, though.
[02:47:34.231 --> 02:47:35.132]  Oh no, they made money.
[02:47:35.312 --> 02:47:35.573]  Sure.
[02:47:35.713 --> 02:47:37.915]  And they're all making money today.
[02:47:37.935 --> 02:47:42.920]  If you read the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, I read them every day.
[02:47:43.380 --> 02:47:47.064]  They're making enormous profits on all these weapons systems.
[02:47:47.084 --> 02:47:50.307]  The oil companies are making enormous profits.
[02:47:50.387 --> 02:47:50.928]  Remember the
[02:47:51.789 --> 02:47:56.952]  Bush family is heavily invested in oil, so whenever the oil prices go up, they make more money, sure.
[02:47:56.972 --> 02:48:01.015]  Do you ever run into these neocons at events or functions?
[02:48:01.515 --> 02:48:05.438]  I debate them, sure.
[02:48:06.899 --> 02:48:15.625]  I was once speaking at the National Press Club several years ago, and we went up for lunch, and right ahead is a line waiting for a seat.
[02:48:16.983 --> 02:48:25.325]  Uh, it was Elliot Abrams, my classmate from Harvard Law School, and they sat him and the Mater D came back and said, uh, where would you like to sit?
[02:48:26.205 --> 02:48:37.767]  And I said in a very, uh, loud tone of voice, uh, I don't want to be anywhere near that man because the odor of blood is too great.
[02:48:38.267 --> 02:48:44.968]  He had killed 35,000 down in Nicaragua, and yet here he is, the, uh, Deputy National Security Advisor,
[02:48:45.780 --> 02:48:52.662]  And he is now orchestrating what can only be said to be a clash of civilizations.
[02:48:52.702 --> 02:48:53.543]  But see, they don't care.
[02:48:53.583 --> 02:48:54.563]  They don't care.
[02:48:54.723 --> 02:48:55.283]  That is correct.
[02:48:55.443 --> 02:48:57.204]  They enjoy killing people, don't they?
[02:48:57.224 --> 02:48:58.044]  It's like a power trip.
[02:48:58.885 --> 02:48:59.345]  Right.
[02:48:59.425 --> 02:49:04.547]  As Henry Kissinger said about the Iraq-Iran war, our strategy is to have them kill each other off.
[02:49:04.707 --> 02:49:11.469]  Well, he also called, I'll paraphrase it, I forget the exact quote, he called our military men in Vietnam like dumb animals.
[02:49:12.492 --> 02:49:13.052]  That's correct.
[02:49:13.372 --> 02:49:16.673]  Again, I went through the same program at Harvard that produced Kissinger.
[02:49:17.073 --> 02:49:19.273]  And that's exactly the way they think.
[02:49:20.054 --> 02:49:25.295]  And Harvard has learned nothing from the Vietnam War.
[02:49:25.315 --> 02:49:36.137]  They still train major war criminals and war mongers such as Kissinger at Harvard today as we speak.
[02:49:36.437 --> 02:49:37.337]  Let's be clear though.
[02:49:37.377 --> 02:49:42.198]  Let's say there's a father listening out in Austin whose son is in Iraq.
[02:49:43.303 --> 02:49:48.886]  And he would say to me, and these are real people I'm talking about, well, I know it's bad, but we can't leave without victory.
[02:49:48.926 --> 02:49:49.907]  It's some ego thing.
[02:49:50.307 --> 02:49:52.529]  They don't understand victory was never meant.
[02:49:54.410 --> 02:50:01.114]  The victory you've been told about, you're putting in a government and beating the insurgency and leaving, they are there to create the insurgency.
[02:50:01.474 --> 02:50:02.314]  What do you say to that?
[02:50:02.334 --> 02:50:11.740]  Right, and also, Alex, I'll let you point out, you see, the strategy here all along was to destroy Iraq as a viable nation-state.
[02:50:13.006 --> 02:50:18.010]  If you read Huntington's Clash of Civilizations, and again, I went through the same Ph.D.
[02:50:18.030 --> 02:50:20.532]  program at Harvard that produced Huntington.
[02:50:20.632 --> 02:50:24.214]  He was their enemy, and was on the faculty.
[02:50:24.274 --> 02:50:27.577]  I wouldn't study with him because of his support for the Vietnam War.
[02:50:28.958 --> 02:50:41.767]  They wanted to destroy Iraq as a viable nation-state, because as Huntington pointed out, Iraq was probably the only Arab nation-state
[02:50:42.825 --> 02:50:52.292]  That could have provided leadership to the Arab world in a confrontation with the West over the energy supplies.
[02:50:52.713 --> 02:50:54.915]  So Iraq had to be destroyed.
[02:50:55.635 --> 02:51:01.700]  And this is a policy, going back to Bush Senior, as I point out in my book, the first Iraq war,
[02:51:02.478 --> 02:51:05.100]  Uh, where he, he, you know, just obliterated it.
[02:51:05.740 --> 02:51:08.882]  And then there was the de facto cover of Iraq in three pieces.
[02:51:09.082 --> 02:51:11.504]  The Kurds in the north, the Shia in the south, the... Stay there.
[02:51:11.704 --> 02:51:12.004]  Stay there.
[02:51:12.024 --> 02:51:12.505]  We've got a break.
[02:51:12.525 --> 02:51:12.985]  Final segment.
[02:51:13.005 --> 02:51:19.789]  We're going to come back and talk to, uh, Paul in New Orleans and two other callers quickly in the final segment.
[02:51:19.809 --> 02:51:21.310]  Tell folks about your books.
[02:51:21.731 --> 02:51:22.411]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:22.451 --> 02:51:22.771]  Stay with us.
[02:51:32.088 --> 02:51:32.569]  It's here.
[02:51:32.749 --> 02:51:37.514]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:51:37.894 --> 02:51:45.563]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:46.235 --> 02:51:53.277]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:53.678 --> 02:52:05.101]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:05.422 --> 02:52:08.923]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:09.383 --> 02:52:11.324]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:11.644 --> 02:52:15.485]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:30.493 --> 02:52:31.534]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:52:31.854 --> 02:52:34.635]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:52:34.915 --> 02:52:39.058]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:52:39.478 --> 02:52:40.318]  So what do you do?

[02:52:45.681 --> 02:52:47.822]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:54:42.723 --> 02:54:44.103]  I'm looking at four of them right here.
[02:54:46.644 --> 02:54:48.425]  Destroying World Order, U.S.
[02:54:48.485 --> 02:54:50.887]  imperialism in the Middle East, before and after September 11th.
[02:54:52.528 --> 02:54:53.848]  Let's hurriedly go to three calls.
[02:54:54.229 --> 02:54:57.171]  Let's talk to Paul in New Orleans, been holding patiently.
[02:54:57.211 --> 02:54:57.791]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:54:58.231 --> 02:54:59.212]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[02:54:59.392 --> 02:54:59.752]  Good, sir.
[02:55:00.232 --> 02:55:05.015]  You know, um, oh, gee, you opened my mind up with your program.
[02:55:05.436 --> 02:55:06.476]  I'm going to spread the word.
[02:55:07.157 --> 02:55:13.861]  Thomas Jefferson said, um, the occasion of any nation is when it goes outside of its boundaries.
[02:55:14.522 --> 02:55:14.962]  We're there.
[02:55:15.503 --> 02:55:19.066]  Uh, April Gadsby back in, uh, with George, with Daddy Bush.
[02:55:19.426 --> 02:55:20.327]  April Gadsby, yeah.
[02:55:20.967 --> 02:55:21.248]  Okay.
[02:55:21.288 --> 02:55:24.030]  And she, she was talking about, now, you know, I'm just the average show.
[02:55:24.090 --> 02:55:25.571]  I'm just, you know, working hard.
[02:55:25.611 --> 02:55:32.637]  I'm a truck driver, but I remember when she's, uh, was, was asked permission from our government for Saddam to cross-trail.
[02:55:32.677 --> 02:55:33.437]  And they said, yeah.
[02:55:33.918 --> 02:55:42.625]  And then about two, maybe two, three months later, she came back on, uh, C-SPAN and she says that, you know, that she was wrong and it was all part of the new world order.
[02:55:43.223 --> 02:55:46.345]  Which was a clue back, you know, back in the 90s what was going on.
[02:55:46.866 --> 02:55:51.569]  Is there any way that George Bush can be tried for war crimes?
[02:55:51.709 --> 02:56:00.515]  I read an article where a Hawaiian American is not going to go back in the service because he said that the war was illegal.
[02:56:00.555 --> 02:56:02.797]  This is not our military and it is illegal.
[02:56:02.877 --> 02:56:04.718]  Dr. Boyle, you want to comment on what he's saying?
[02:56:05.899 --> 02:56:08.501]  Yes, I'm currently working on that case.
[02:56:08.541 --> 02:56:12.784]  Lieutenant Aaron Matata, a very courageous young man.
[02:56:13.676 --> 02:56:22.482]  I was out there for his Article 32 hearing, and hopefully I'll be going back for the full court-martial.
[02:56:23.282 --> 02:56:26.464]  I would encourage all of you to support Lieutenant Wattada.
[02:56:26.844 --> 02:56:31.467]  He refuses to have anything to do with this criminal war against Iraq.
[02:56:31.567 --> 02:56:32.968]  I need to get his dad on the show.
[02:56:32.988 --> 02:56:33.888]  I've been meaning to do that.
[02:56:34.489 --> 02:56:36.170]  Bob Wattada is his name.
[02:56:36.410 --> 02:56:36.650]  Right.
[02:56:37.010 --> 02:56:40.973]  The family is very... He's got to be careful what he says now, because the
[02:56:42.122 --> 02:56:53.329]  He's being court-martialed for comments he made to the press that are perfectly lawful and valid, and an exercise of his First Amendment rights.
[02:56:53.409 --> 02:56:55.450]  Absolutely, his right to refuse illegal orders.
[02:56:55.650 --> 02:56:56.831]  Let's talk to Kevin in Boston.
[02:56:56.851 --> 02:56:57.511]  Thank you, Paul.
[02:56:57.971 --> 02:56:58.692]  Good, good points.
[02:56:58.752 --> 02:56:59.412]  Kevin, go ahead.
[02:57:00.272 --> 02:57:07.937]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you, Dr. Francis Foyle, for putting yourself on the line for truth and the right way of things, you know, being a doctor and everything.
[02:57:08.362 --> 02:57:09.323]  We appreciate it.
[02:57:09.503 --> 02:57:14.405]  I have some quick points on Saddam Hussein, I believe, was not the real Saddam executed.
[02:57:14.485 --> 02:57:18.668]  I know, I respect what you're saying, Alex, and I just have some points for you to consider.
[02:57:20.208 --> 02:57:32.315]  It was on April 5th, 2003, that a clean-shaven appeared in the streets when they thought he was dead, and they were trying to celebrate, oh, he's probably dead, he's gone, and he appeared in the streets, clean-shaven in his fatigues, with the crowds cheering him.
[02:57:33.248 --> 02:57:35.250]  That was what I believe was the real Saddam.
[02:57:35.290 --> 02:57:36.010]  Let me get a comment.
[02:57:36.030 --> 02:57:38.312]  Dr. Boyle, what do you know about the people that say this?
[02:57:40.513 --> 02:57:46.497]  Well, I would say whether it's the real Saddam or not is somewhat beside the point.
[02:57:46.517 --> 02:57:49.359]  This lynching, it was clearly designed to be a lynching.
[02:57:50.840 --> 02:58:00.987]  As I pointed out, it was set up by the neoconservatives in the White House, first to distract public attention from the 3,000 dead soldier.
[02:58:02.691 --> 02:58:16.675]  And then, second, to stir up hostilities between Shia and Sunnis in Iraq, and also in the Muslim world itself to inspire more terrorism against Americans.
[02:58:16.715 --> 02:58:24.198]  Yeah, these guys need terrorism against Americans to justify what they're doing.
[02:58:24.338 --> 02:58:25.158]  We're out of time.
[02:58:25.178 --> 02:58:25.798]  That's P2OG.
[02:58:26.178 --> 02:58:28.639]  I mean, these guys are hyper Machiavellian, are they not?
[02:58:29.505 --> 02:58:32.768]  That's exactly what we were trained at the University of Chicago.
[02:58:32.869 --> 02:58:37.894]  We had to know Maki Valley up and down and in our sleep.

[02:58:41.458 --> 02:58:45.462]  To get a PhD in political science at Harvard, like Kissinger,
[02:58:45.962 --> 02:58:53.912]  Brzezinski, Huntington, and me, you had to know you're Machiavelli up and down and in your sleep and by your vote.
[02:58:54.032 --> 02:58:54.934]  That is exactly correct.
[02:58:55.134 --> 02:58:55.354]  Yes.
[02:58:55.534 --> 02:58:56.896]  Ultra Machiavellian system.
[02:58:58.097 --> 02:59:01.161]  Sorry to Robert in Texas and others, we don't have time to get your calls.
[02:59:01.201 --> 02:59:02.443]  Call me back tomorrow, I'll be live.
[02:59:02.743 --> 02:59:04.646]  Dr. Boyle, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:59:05.206 --> 02:59:08.312]  Well, thanks for having me on and again, Happy New Year to everyone out there.

[02:59:34.840 --> 02:59:37.861]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:59:38.161 --> 02:59:41.583]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
