[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.981]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:11.461]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.222 --> 00:00:13.102]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.782 --> 00:00:17.703]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.963 --> 00:00:22.084]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.218 --> 00:00:37.860]  Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.542]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.565]  It's already the 11th day.
[00:00:45.206 --> 00:00:46.988]  The 11th day of December 2007.
[00:00:47.108 --> 00:00:51.592]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:52.253 --> 00:00:52.993]  I'm going through 40, 50, 60.
[00:00:53.474 --> 00:00:55.195]  I didn't count them all up.
[00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:56.837]  I was trying to watch them all last night.
[00:00:56.857 --> 00:00:57.597]  They're excellent.
[00:00:57.617 --> 00:01:00.580]  I've been watching them the last few weeks as they come in.
[00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.482]  All the different radio and TV ads.
[00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:04.232]  We're good to go.
[00:01:28.698 --> 00:01:36.504]  And then I'll basically look at all of them myself and take into consideration what they think is the most effective.
[00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:43.970]  And then I'm going to, with them, pick a winner and then write up a little blurb about why we think it's the winner.
[00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:48.594]  For first place, one minute, 60 second TV ad.
[00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:53.558]  Second place, 60 second TV ad.
[00:01:53.598 --> 00:01:55.079]  And third place, 60 second TV ad.
[00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.541]  And then there's one prize, 500 bucks,
[00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:02.133]  Uh, for, uh, the best radio ad.
[00:02:03.654 --> 00:02:24.626]  And we have gotten quite a few submissions, and they're excellent, and we cut off the cut-off date for it last night for submissions, but you can go over to truthnews.us and look at all of those, and hopefully spread them around, because the whole goal of this is in the build-up to the money bomb coming up on the 16th, uh, that's now just five days away.
[00:02:25.347 --> 00:02:27.428]  That is this Sunday.
[00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:34.884]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to try to raise at least $6,000,000 on the Money Bomb Day.
[00:02:36.905 --> 00:02:42.268]  By the way, I've got to get around to telling all my website webmasters, go ahead and put Big Tea Party 2007 links.
[00:02:42.288 --> 00:02:50.372]  We've already had a lot of stories and links up there, but Big Fat Links will be going up in the next few days at the top of the page.
[00:02:51.454 --> 00:03:04.399]  As we try to do our part in getting the word out about the money bomb to get massive attention, the Congressman Ron Paul going into the primaries, really on average quadruple the amount of press we get versus even how much money comes in.
[00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:13.822]  That is, the amount of press we get dwarfs the amount of ads, radio, TV ads, print ads, that Congressman Ron Paul's campaign will be able to even buy.
[00:03:14.523 --> 00:03:15.543]  So it's a win-win.
[00:03:18.244 --> 00:03:20.585]  He's raised, I don't know, eleven
[00:03:21.587 --> 00:03:23.088]  Come up with $11.5 million.
[00:03:24.448 --> 00:03:25.489]  I haven't looked in a few days.
[00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:29.331]  Right now, their goal for the quarter was $12 million.
[00:03:30.031 --> 00:03:38.015]  And they're going to make that, barring an asteroid hitting the Earth or something, or World War III breaking out.
[00:03:38.715 --> 00:03:43.277]  But imagine if it got international coverage, almost one of the top stories for an entire week.
[00:03:43.998 --> 00:03:46.879]  Got him on Jay Leno, every other major TV program you can imagine.
[00:03:47.774 --> 00:03:50.976]  And his poll numbers, by the way, doubled when that happened, when they heard what he had to say.
[00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:55.718]  Imagine if we raised $6 million instead of $4.2 million in one day.
[00:03:56.098 --> 00:04:06.883]  And Vegas is saying that it's, what, 3-1 odds right now in favor of Ron Paul winning by winning the goal of $6 million.
[00:04:13.337 --> 00:04:18.279]  So that said, we'll be announcing by Thursday noon on this radio show.
[00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:28.062]  I might even judge it and announce it earlier, but I'm giving myself until Wednesday, Thursday at noon to do that so I can really vet all of these great entries.
[00:04:28.422 --> 00:04:35.864]  But all of you win by entering the contest because these videos go viral, many of them go viral, and then it's just that much more
[00:04:37.056 --> 00:04:37.757]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:37.797 --> 00:04:39.258]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.121 --> 00:05:10.326]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:11.026 --> 00:05:13.189]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.112]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.652 --> 00:05:19.035]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.799 --> 00:05:27.201]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.162 --> 00:05:35.123]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.623 --> 00:05:38.884]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.484 --> 00:05:41.545]  Global Parity is making great progress in the world.
[00:05:42.045 --> 00:05:43.185]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.205 --> 00:05:43.965]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:45.046]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.266 --> 00:05:46.006]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:47.066]  That's what I have to do.
[00:05:47.406 --> 00:05:55.589]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:58.469]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.070]  You have been warned.

[00:07:01.164 --> 00:07:01.564]  Attention!

[00:07:04.786 --> 00:07:09.088]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:07:09.408 --> 00:07:10.088]  Listen closely.
[00:07:10.748 --> 00:07:18.212]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[00:07:18.512 --> 00:07:27.276]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[00:07:27.596 --> 00:07:30.537]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country,
[00:07:30.757 --> 00:07:33.078]  No health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:42.844]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[00:07:43.024 --> 00:07:48.667]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.

[00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:19.765]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:19.825 --> 00:08:21.706]  Central Standard Time, we're here live.

[00:09:02.346 --> 00:09:06.269]  We also restream the show 21 hours a day.
[00:09:06.329 --> 00:09:07.870]  When we go off at 2 p.m.
[00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:14.035]  Central, then three hours is re-aired back-to-back until the next
[00:09:14.884 --> 00:09:18.025]  day when I go back on air live.
[00:09:19.445 --> 00:09:21.966]  Okay, here is just some of the news today.
[00:09:22.046 --> 00:09:26.527]  New Jersey nears mandated preschool flu shots.
[00:09:27.547 --> 00:09:30.868]  Now they want to make the babies take the flu shots.
[00:09:31.368 --> 00:09:36.609]  Incidentally, New Jersey has the highest incidence of inoculation in the country.
[00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.270]  I had seen that number from the feds before.
[00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:44.351]  It also has the highest number of autistic children
[00:09:45.365 --> 00:09:49.529]  In the country, and they're doing the same propaganda piece they always push.
[00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:50.931]  Oh, it's the law.
[00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.033]  You've got to take it.
[00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:56.696]  You've got to take it if your child is in any preschool.
[00:09:57.217 --> 00:09:59.859]  So see, now it's not just enough to lie and say it's the law.
[00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:02.662]  You have to take it when you're in first grade through 12th grade.
[00:10:03.659 --> 00:10:05.679]  Or, you've got to take shots to be in college.
[00:10:05.879 --> 00:10:07.100]  All lies, there is no law.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:07.960]  Totally made up.
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:08.920]  We've proven that.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:15.141]  We've had state officials and federal officials on who are pushing it, saying, you have to.
[00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.881]  And we go, but wait, there's no law.
[00:10:16.901 --> 00:10:18.262]  And they say, well, yes, you're right.
[00:10:18.322 --> 00:10:19.682]  But we mandate it.
[00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:21.522]  And then we kick you out of school if you don't.
[00:10:21.862 --> 00:10:23.022]  And then we say you're truant.
[00:10:23.062 --> 00:10:25.723]  And then criminal charges kick in.
[00:10:27.123 --> 00:10:32.124]  And so this mass hoax continues unabated against the people.
[00:10:34.341 --> 00:10:43.326]  By the way, along this line, this actually came out Sunday about New Jersey, quote, mandating, saying you have to take them.
[00:10:43.947 --> 00:10:44.567]  Total lie.
[00:10:45.848 --> 00:10:56.694]  And I had remembered over the years all the research I'd done, all the research I'd run into, all the literally hundreds and hundreds, I've lost count, of mainstream news articles
[00:10:58.718 --> 00:11:26.085]  Where the UN goes into an African country, a Middle Eastern country, a Central Asian country, a Southeast Asian, a North Asian country, a Latin American country, a European country, a Western country, the United States, and where they give them polio shots, smallpox shots, MMR shots, measles, mumps, rubella, and everybody starts dropping dead, or getting polio, or getting smallpox, and dying,
[00:11:26.972 --> 00:11:36.014]  And BBC reports where they found in Nigeria that they gave thousands of children shots.
[00:11:36.434 --> 00:11:39.074]  They all got a virulent strain of AIDS.
[00:11:39.535 --> 00:11:44.216]  And then they went and did medical checkups and found that none of the children had ever had sex.
[00:11:45.216 --> 00:11:46.936]  And they never had blood transfusions.
[00:11:46.976 --> 00:11:48.316]  And their parents didn't have it.
[00:11:48.716 --> 00:11:56.318]  And the BBC said, oh, they must have been, the clinics run by the UN, must have been reusing the same needles.
[00:11:57.601 --> 00:11:58.461]  No, my friends.
[00:11:59.362 --> 00:12:00.022]  No, my friends.
[00:12:00.082 --> 00:12:13.845]  We've got cases where one hospital in one year gives 400 children or half the children plus that came through the one hospital get virulent AIDS.
[00:12:14.345 --> 00:12:15.926]  Not the stuff here in the U.S.
[00:12:15.986 --> 00:12:16.826]  It's bioweapon.
[00:12:17.226 --> 00:12:18.607]  I got a watered-down version here.
[00:12:18.647 --> 00:12:19.987]  There's multiple strains.
[00:12:20.447 --> 00:12:22.208]  But stuff that kills you real fast.
[00:12:26.067 --> 00:12:38.358]  And then you get the numbers about how blacks are many times more likely to contract AIDS, despite the fact that whites can even have, in controlled studies, more sexual partners who even have HIV, and they don't get it.
[00:12:38.698 --> 00:12:42.281]  Because it's a race-specific bioweapon.
[00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:47.626]  Whites can get it, but it's very, very hard, and generally from a blood transfusion.
[00:12:48.146 --> 00:12:51.029]  The point is, where there's smoke, there's fire.
[00:12:52.705 --> 00:13:06.840]  And you add into this equation the fact that some African countries have 45 plus percent AIDS infection.
[00:13:07.961 --> 00:13:10.063]  45 plus percent in multiple countries.
[00:13:10.083 --> 00:13:14.888]  The average African nation has more than 20 percent infection.
[00:13:18.553 --> 00:13:31.862]  The problem is, I printed off like 300 pages of government documents, media reports, just this weekend, and then I look at the stack and I'm just like, how do I even warn the people?
[00:13:32.782 --> 00:13:34.804]  How do you even explain to them?
[00:13:37.465 --> 00:13:38.306]  But it's real simple.
[00:13:40.247 --> 00:13:47.712]  We have a government, a global government, a global technocracy that through treaties, from the US to China,
[00:13:49.221 --> 00:13:57.784]  From Italy to Mexico, from Chile to South Africa, that has a unified health service global standards.
[00:14:01.806 --> 00:14:09.829]  And this very people running this global system openly say they want to reduce world population forcibly by 80%.
[00:14:10.309 --> 00:14:16.471]  They talk about using war, engineered war, famine, pathogens.
[00:14:17.211 --> 00:14:17.992]  This goes back to the 50's.
[00:14:19.002 --> 00:14:19.863]  Back to the 40s.
[00:14:21.084 --> 00:14:24.527]  In the food, in the water, in the vaccines, and then voila!
[00:14:25.287 --> 00:14:32.033]  Magically, hundreds of millions of die, hundreds of millions, I guess now total billions get sick and die from all of this.
[00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:35.796]  It's going on right out in front of everybody.
[00:14:35.816 --> 00:14:37.918]  This is what Endgame covers.
[00:14:39.299 --> 00:14:40.280]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:44.564]  If you had a neighbor that had nerve gas US troops and killed them,
[00:14:45.166 --> 00:14:48.288]  If you had a neighbor that had radiated 4,000 plus U.S.
[00:14:48.649 --> 00:14:50.050]  foster children and murdered them.
[00:14:50.830 --> 00:15:04.840]  If you had a neighbor that had sprayed biological weapons in the San Francisco harbor and the New York subways and all over the nation, 13,000 plus above ground tests of lethal pathogens.
[00:15:06.369 --> 00:15:09.270]  Would you trust them to run your country, to run your government?
[00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:10.750]  Well, that's who runs the country.
[00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.170]  That's who runs the government.
[00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:13.611]  That's who runs the world.
[00:15:13.651 --> 00:15:16.931]  They've been caught tens of thousands of times!
[00:15:18.712 --> 00:15:20.972]  You literally... It's endless.
[00:15:20.992 --> 00:15:24.313]  You could never even... Most of it's declassified.
[00:15:24.353 --> 00:15:25.954]  You in your life couldn't read it all!
[00:15:29.214 --> 00:15:31.435]  I mean, each operation is hundreds of pages.
[00:15:31.535 --> 00:15:32.295]  It's all public!
[00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:35.313]  And by all public, the thousands of things we know about.
[00:15:35.713 --> 00:15:43.555]  Heaven knows, only knows, what's really going on, just how big it is, just how massive it is.
[00:15:44.255 --> 00:15:54.418]  I was talking to Dr. Stan Monteith on his syndicated show last week, last weekend, and he put out some numbers, and I went and googled them, and I'd forgotten them.
[00:15:56.919 --> 00:16:00.740]  I've literally forgotten more than most people will ever learn.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:01.620]  It's so frustrating.
[00:16:02.279 --> 00:16:05.400]  And I checked his numbers, it was actually worse than what he was saying.
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.361]  In 1920, they had good statistical analysis and numbers.
[00:16:09.921 --> 00:16:16.042]  Guess how many people died of cancer in the 1920s?
[00:16:16.062 --> 00:16:19.323]  1 in 33 people would die of cancer.
[00:16:19.763 --> 00:16:23.724]  In 2006, the latest numbers we have, guess how many people will die of cancer?
[00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:30.206]  1 in 3, and if the graph continues, it will be 1 and a half out of 3.
[00:16:31.181 --> 00:16:32.242]  Within 5 years.
[00:16:32.802 --> 00:16:35.324]  Within 10 years, it will be 2 out of 3.
[00:16:37.206 --> 00:16:46.193]  I mean, folks, that's compared to car wrecks, heart attacks, drownings, murders, shootings, stabbings, strokes.
[00:16:47.754 --> 00:16:48.775]  It's already 1 in 3?
[00:16:49.195 --> 00:16:50.276]  From 1 in 33, 80 years ago?
[00:17:00.313 --> 00:17:02.874]  I mean, this is incredible!
[00:17:05.055 --> 00:17:10.817]  And we need doctors and statisticians and scientists to collate all this data and to look at it.
[00:17:13.938 --> 00:17:16.659]  We need people to face up to it and to deal with it.
[00:17:16.719 --> 00:17:23.081]  We have a huge admitted massive eugenics operation going on against us.
[00:17:23.141 --> 00:17:28.363]  I mean, they'll go into Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,
[00:17:30.327 --> 00:17:34.749]  Turkmenistan, Pakistan, this is the last year.
[00:17:35.849 --> 00:17:46.272]  They'll give children the polio shot under UN funding and they'll all get it and start dropping dead or becoming paralyzed or crippled.
[00:17:47.613 --> 00:17:56.996]  And it comes out in the news and the BBC says, well, this will add fuel to the fire that locals think the government's poisoning them with these.
[00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:06.735]  An African nation after African nation after African nation, when they come through and shoot everybody up and then everybody gets AIDS!
[00:18:07.635 --> 00:18:28.693]  And then you find out in government documents that they created the AIDS virus in a laboratory, put it in San Francisco and New York, in hepatitis vaccines, at the city clinics with the trusting homosexual men coming in and getting it, who they knew had hundreds of sexual partners a month in some cases, hundreds on average a year, and that they would vector that
[00:18:30.194 --> 00:18:34.157]  Just like a rat is the vector for the flea for the bubonic plague.
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:39.981]  Well, this is the vector.
[00:18:41.542 --> 00:18:44.745]  These poor people being killed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:45.886 --> 00:18:51.790]  And it's an absolute documented fact in quadruplicate on top of quadruplicate.
[00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:57.234]  And then I was doing a search on this a few days ago and I'd forgotten about three years ago, remember Libya?
[00:18:57.674 --> 00:18:58.355]  One hospital
[00:19:00.298 --> 00:19:10.105]  400 plus children, or half the kids that have gone through, who've all gotten a smallpox inoculation through a U.N.
[00:19:10.145 --> 00:19:17.050]  program, they all got virulent AIDS, just like in the African, other Southern, Sub-Saharan African nations.
[00:19:18.832 --> 00:19:27.118]  And then the World Health Organization put out a report saying, oh, it was bad sanitation at the hospital.
[00:19:28.112 --> 00:19:30.334]  Folks, AIDS dies out in the air in seconds.
[00:19:30.394 --> 00:19:31.355]  It's very, very weak.
[00:19:32.276 --> 00:19:36.239]  It takes the average person multiple exposures to get it.
[00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:41.944]  That's why it's associated with blood transfusions and anal sex.
[00:19:44.646 --> 00:19:54.334]  Because you'll get ounces of it, ounces of blood product into your body through a transfusion or through the unprotected anal sex because it
[00:19:55.293 --> 00:19:56.857]  It's a perfect transmission zone.
[00:19:57.178 --> 00:19:59.183]  It's impossible for all these children to get it.
[00:20:02.466 --> 00:20:04.428]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:20:04.688 --> 00:20:07.311]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:20:07.611 --> 00:20:15.939]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:20:16.239 --> 00:20:19.062]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:20:19.903 --> 00:20:23.126]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:20:24.447 --> 00:20:26.029]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:20:26.409 --> 00:20:27.330]  Take action now!
[00:20:27.471 --> 00:20:31.936]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:20:32.277 --> 00:20:36.041]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:20:36.262 --> 00:20:39.486]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:20:39.586 --> 00:20:41.288]  Current Federal Reserve policy and
[00:20:41.288 --> 00:20:41.688]  I think so.
[00:21:01.943 --> 00:21:05.124]  Yes, there is an In-Dash AM-FM shortwave radio.
[00:21:05.404 --> 00:21:13.486]  For limited time and in limited numbers, the Sony GT-160S AM-FM shortwave radio and CD player is available only at the Power Hour.

[00:21:37.193 --> 00:21:37.533]  That's right!
[00:22:02.054 --> 00:22:10.396]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing Cruden Places USA, an interactive CD book that is your premier resource for hard-to-find information.
[00:22:10.556 --> 00:22:20.619]  Find out about everything from job migration to evacuation information, such as major bridges in disrepair and FEMA evacuation time studies for coastal cities.
[00:22:21.099 --> 00:22:26.943]  Zero in on man-made disaster zones, environmental areas of concern, and natural disaster zones.
[00:22:27.164 --> 00:22:37.891]  Find out everything from where to get water in an emergency, the geographic income levels, housing prices, complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on the 3,000 plus counties in the U.S.
[00:22:38.071 --> 00:22:39.132]  Full color photographs.
[00:22:39.332 --> 00:22:39.872]  We're good to go.
[00:23:02.631 --> 00:23:04.693]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:05.334 --> 00:23:14.262]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:14.703 --> 00:23:21.910]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:22.626 --> 00:23:28.110]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:23:28.591 --> 00:23:39.419]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.281]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:23:42.762 --> 00:23:44.183]  For more information, call 702-953-0111.
[00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:56.992]  I'm challenging every man, woman, and child listening to my voice to go research this
[00:24:17.927 --> 00:24:36.799]  You've already heard hundreds of times, it's been on mainstream news, that, oh, they radiated children, oh, they radiated women, oh, they killed G.I.s with nerve gas, oh, our government hired thousands of Nazis and brought them over here, oh, they're killing black kids and others in New York in foster care and pesticide tests.
[00:24:37.499 --> 00:24:42.643]  Eh, but you know, just thousands and thousands of times, you know they've done that.
[00:24:43.543 --> 00:24:44.644]  You know they're killers.
[00:24:45.592 --> 00:24:46.552]  You know there's U.N.
[00:24:46.592 --> 00:24:53.695]  documents, biological diversity assessments, presidential decision directives, State Department Memorandum 200, official U.S.
[00:24:53.735 --> 00:25:01.498]  government policy, treaties with China, one-child policies, Australia announcing they want to do it, fine you every year if you have more than two children.
[00:25:02.919 --> 00:25:04.319]  They're doing it, okay?
[00:25:05.119 --> 00:25:07.620]  And then they call them those ignorant Africans.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.462]  Oh, they just... It's no big deal that some of their countries have 45% levels.
[00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:15.731]  Of age?
[00:25:16.511 --> 00:25:20.234]  That it's a really nasty form that kills you real fast?
[00:25:23.956 --> 00:25:27.499]  But then if you're Tommy Morris and or Magic Johnson, you can live 15 years with it.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.181]  And jog five miles a day and feel great.
[00:25:33.943 --> 00:25:36.885]  They have bio-weapon strains of it in Africa.
[00:25:36.945 --> 00:25:38.606]  Now those strains have gotten into the U.S.
[00:25:38.626 --> 00:25:42.289]  and that's been here and there in the New York Times, other papers, but they shut it down.
[00:25:44.907 --> 00:25:46.168]  But it is a fact.
[00:25:46.228 --> 00:25:56.396]  The medical community knew by the mid-1980s that it was race-specific and that it just wipes blacks out.
[00:25:57.577 --> 00:25:59.839]  There's also other strains that tend to go after Asians.
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.022]  And now you've got North Africans.
[00:26:04.102 --> 00:26:13.170]  It's spreading all over North Africa despite the fact that they've gone and done medical tests on these children and they haven't had sex.
[00:26:14.853 --> 00:26:25.003]  They haven't had blood transfusions, they get taken down to the hospital by the government school, and they get their shot, and the government gets IMF, World Bank, UN money, and then they die.
[00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:32.331]  But I spent about an hour last night just re-researching the Libya situation.
[00:26:34.167 --> 00:26:42.493]  But I'd forgotten about just one of many cases, and it's so amazing when you read the BBC reports and others, they go, well, they just said it was bad hygiene at the hospital.
[00:26:42.533 --> 00:26:44.934]  That's why half the kids that went through it in that year got it.
[00:26:47.856 --> 00:26:50.378]  And you know, Libya, they're backwards and evil terrorists.
[00:26:50.438 --> 00:26:56.242]  They just tortured the nurses to get them to lie and say that they were paid to go inject this in people.
[00:26:56.582 --> 00:26:59.824]  Folks, those nurses probably weren't even involved.
[00:26:59.924 --> 00:27:01.365]  It's all compartmentalized.
[00:27:01.405 --> 00:27:02.126]  The feel-good,
[00:27:04.073 --> 00:27:15.539]  AmeriCorps, people that go out and do this all over the world, the feel-good UN-funded sponsored groups, they don't know.
[00:27:16.279 --> 00:27:21.481]  They think they're giving mother's milk to these babies, just like the doctors in your town pushing vaccines on you.
[00:27:23.662 --> 00:27:26.324]  I mean, you think they're coercive and lie here in the U.S.
[00:27:26.344 --> 00:27:28.885]  saying it's the law, you've got to take vaccines, when it isn't.
[00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:34.651]  And how they coerce and bully people to get on Medicare or Medicaid or get any government support or to go to school.
[00:27:35.352 --> 00:27:37.493]  Can you imagine what they do to Latin Americans?
[00:27:37.813 --> 00:27:41.556]  Can you imagine what they do to uneducated immigrants?
[00:27:42.756 --> 00:27:50.321]  Can you imagine what they do to these people in these little dirt-floored village communal homes?
[00:27:51.462 --> 00:27:54.484]  Can you imagine what they do in Central Asia?
[00:27:56.483 --> 00:28:07.054]  But I'll tell you what, those individuals who are literally in the Bronze Age in some cases, who literally don't ever come off their mountaintop, they know that everybody's healthy, and they get the shots and people start dropping dead.
[00:28:10.137 --> 00:28:10.978]  But just go look at that!
[00:28:11.338 --> 00:28:15.102]  Quote, accidents, all over the globe.
[00:28:17.225 --> 00:28:18.486]  Type polio shot,
[00:28:19.534 --> 00:28:21.415]  Gives thousands of polio into Google.
[00:28:21.455 --> 00:28:24.735]  Type smallpox shot gives thousands of smallpox into Google.
[00:28:24.995 --> 00:28:28.056]  You'll have mainstream articles all over the world, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:28:29.377 --> 00:28:31.077]  And by the way, the same thing happens here.
[00:28:31.117 --> 00:28:36.418]  The health services just keep it real quiet because they're told they are under the gun for liability.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.740]  And this is the big issue.
[00:28:45.301 --> 00:28:46.501]  This is the big enchilada.
[00:28:47.688 --> 00:28:48.388]  That we face.
[00:28:48.909 --> 00:28:52.190]  Driving into work this morning, I noticed five new billboards.
[00:28:52.290 --> 00:29:02.276]  By the time I started looking, up on Lamar, and one of the side streets, that say, give your baby every shot.
[00:29:02.716 --> 00:29:05.097]  Give your baby all their vaccines to make them healthy.
[00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:09.599]  And they're all up and down I-35, big huge billboards.
[00:29:09.659 --> 00:29:16.403]  Just everywhere, endless lies, endless propaganda, because they know we're exposing them and we're fighting them.
[00:29:18.311 --> 00:29:25.033]  I'm not saying that the vaccines were produced properly and watched over and sampled and tested that they couldn't have some uses.
[00:29:25.834 --> 00:29:36.417]  The point is, we've got a bunch of murdering eugenicists sworn to kill us publicly who've done all these public tests where they've murdered people all over the globe and right here in the U.S.
[00:29:38.278 --> 00:29:41.479]  We have the troops dying from smallpox and anthrax shots en masse.
[00:29:41.499 --> 00:29:42.299]  We protested.
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.540]  They suspended that.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.521]  Man, we're under military attack!
[00:29:47.674 --> 00:29:48.855]  There's no debating it!
[00:29:49.415 --> 00:29:50.695]  There's no denying it!
[00:29:52.016 --> 00:29:52.956]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.417 --> 00:29:55.037]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.057 --> 00:29:58.639]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.644 --> 00:30:03.125]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.

[00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:57.111]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:05.644]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:31:05.904 --> 00:31:10.728]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:31:10.989 --> 00:31:12.350]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:15.853]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:31:40.695 --> 00:31:41.836]  And I save big time.

[00:32:07.155 --> 00:32:11.398]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:32:11.818 --> 00:32:18.662]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:19.102 --> 00:32:25.809]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:26.129 --> 00:32:27.750]  There are no reported side effects.
[00:32:28.051 --> 00:32:31.234]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:31.514 --> 00:32:33.956]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:49.971]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[00:33:22.245 --> 00:33:31.789]  We have created a page on PrisonPlanet.com that details all 50 states waiver forms.
[00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:37.472]  But that's a fraud as well because it's a waiver for a law that doesn't exist.
[00:33:37.512 --> 00:33:39.513]  It's a waiver for a policy.
[00:33:39.553 --> 00:33:43.675]  They just come and intimidate you because the states and counties want federal money.
[00:33:44.955 --> 00:33:50.958]  And much of their federal grants and funds are tied to the inoculation rate.
[00:33:52.512 --> 00:33:54.119]  And they come to you and they push it.
[00:33:55.625 --> 00:33:57.151]  And they try to cram it down your throat.
[00:33:57.904 --> 00:34:23.918]  But we have a huge area on the site with how they poison people, how they kill people, all the folks that are dying from the vaccines, the autism levels, but we haven't even begun to collate and put together all the evidence of the bioweapons that they've been caught putting in vaccines for more than 60 years worldwide, or all the government documents where they call for it and say it's the perfect way to insert this into people's bodies.
[00:34:30.111 --> 00:34:56.404]  And now they're engaged in a massive full court press across the world to set the precedent to actually forcibly inoculate us and in 2002 they said we're having a national smallpox program, we're ordering 14 million first responders, every doctor, every nurse, dental assistants, police, firemen,
[00:34:57.566 --> 00:35:00.588]  You name it, 14 million people to take the smallpox shot.
[00:35:00.628 --> 00:35:01.508]  There was no law.
[00:35:02.769 --> 00:35:07.951]  Police chiefs, fire chiefs, medical doctors said no en masse.
[00:35:07.991 --> 00:35:09.512]  Tommy Thompson refused to take it.
[00:35:11.113 --> 00:35:14.034]  But a few thousand did, and a whole bunch of them died.
[00:35:15.075 --> 00:35:17.096]  Then it turned out that it was spreading smallpox.
[00:35:17.136 --> 00:35:18.316]  It was live smallpox.
[00:35:18.837 --> 00:35:20.037]  Lord knows what else was in it.
[00:35:20.297 --> 00:35:23.199]  And then it came out in the news, years after we told you about it.
[00:35:24.031 --> 00:35:36.922]  That they had recruited police and firemen and pastors in cities all over the country to prepare the people for mass roundups, mass arrests, people being forced door-to-door to get on buses.
[00:35:37.422 --> 00:35:44.488]  They were training police to drive buses all over the nation to take them to the local sports stadiums to be forcibly inoculated.
[00:35:45.889 --> 00:35:50.553]  But the plan fell apart because their own enforcers wouldn't take the shots.
[00:35:52.916 --> 00:35:56.737]  We had police chiefs and fire chiefs and others on who said, yeah, I looked into it.
[00:35:56.757 --> 00:35:57.517]  There's no law.
[00:35:57.537 --> 00:35:58.357]  I have to take this.
[00:35:58.857 --> 00:36:02.258]  We're just being told by the city we have to, but the police union says no.
[00:36:03.319 --> 00:36:04.739]  Good job, police.
[00:36:05.439 --> 00:36:06.439]  Use your brains.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:10.540]  Use your brains.
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:11.841]  We're all in this together.
[00:36:13.961 --> 00:36:16.142]  I mean, you're told not to arrest illegal aliens.
[00:36:16.182 --> 00:36:19.883]  The borders are wide open, but you're out running checkpoints, searching citizens' cars.
[00:36:21.023 --> 00:36:21.663]  Figure it out.
[00:36:22.768 --> 00:36:24.269]  You're out fighting the drug war.
[00:36:24.289 --> 00:36:26.731]  You're out busting into houses with crackheads shooting at you.
[00:36:27.471 --> 00:36:32.755]  When the big central banks have been caught red-handed hundreds of times shipping the narcotics in and laundering the money.
[00:36:32.855 --> 00:36:33.415]  It's a joke.
[00:36:33.695 --> 00:36:36.397]  The bigger the war on drugs gets, the more drugs we have.
[00:36:36.717 --> 00:36:39.879]  Just get your head out of the sand like the general public.
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.681]  The general public needs to get their head out of the sand too.
[00:36:43.922 --> 00:36:45.443]  In fact, I'm sitting here on air today.
[00:36:45.483 --> 00:36:47.985]  I'm so upset about this I can hardly even continue the show.
[00:36:49.045 --> 00:36:51.447]  Because it's been hour after hour after hour.
[00:36:57.423 --> 00:37:21.118]  Hour after hour after hour after hour, researching all of this, and to know it's a lie that you don't have to take the vaccines, it's a lie that you're supposed to take them, to know it's a lie that the government loves us and cares about us, they're psychopathic eugenicists, run it all!
[00:37:23.279 --> 00:37:24.300]  It's publicly available!
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:40.072]  And how do I get all these nice families busy running around decorating their Christmas trees and busy going to the gym and busy going to cookouts and busy, you know, putting new drapes up at the house and just having fun lives and going to church?
[00:37:40.732 --> 00:37:41.933]  Their preachers won't tell them.
[00:37:43.214 --> 00:37:45.256]  Their preachers won't even tell them a war is a fraud.
[00:37:46.677 --> 00:37:49.680]  Their preachers won't even tell them both parties are wrong, much less
[00:37:57.919 --> 00:37:59.520]  To make myself focus on this.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.121]  To make myself look at this.
[00:38:01.421 --> 00:38:02.982]  To make myself deal with this.
[00:38:07.204 --> 00:38:09.326]  Sometimes, but more often now than it used to.
[00:38:09.346 --> 00:38:10.226]  It used to be about once a month.
[00:38:10.266 --> 00:38:11.127]  Now it's almost every week.
[00:38:11.607 --> 00:38:13.608]  When I'm doing the show, I just don't even want to do it now.
[00:38:19.412 --> 00:38:21.793]  I just don't even want to deal with this anymore.
[00:38:23.354 --> 00:38:25.235]  Because it's upsetting if you have empathy.
[00:38:25.916 --> 00:38:31.680]  If you care about others, if you realize that what affects others ends up affecting you.
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:37.244]  It's an instinctive, basic understanding to be upset about this stuff happening.
[00:38:42.688 --> 00:38:46.971]  And to know it's just going to go on and on and on and on.
[00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:50.153]  I know there are people out there who listen to this show, who email me.
[00:38:50.928 --> 00:38:55.129]  And who send me YouTube videos where they're making fun of what I'm talking about.
[00:38:55.189 --> 00:38:56.689]  This is not funny!
[00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:04.771]  The things that are happening from 1 in 25,000 children to now 1 in 75 having autism.
[00:39:05.191 --> 00:39:09.572]  From 1 in 33 people having cancer to now 1 in 3 and growing.
[00:39:13.653 --> 00:39:19.234]  I think about a third of the people I know, and I'm talking 25-30 year olds, everybody's got cancer.
[00:39:22.407 --> 00:39:27.989]  Everybody I know either has a child or their brother or sister has a child who's got autism, and it's always the same.
[00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:31.470]  Eighteen months, got the third round of shots, had a convulsion, gone.
[00:39:32.591 --> 00:39:35.792]  In the corner, biting themselves, foaming at the mouth the rest of their life.
[00:39:36.312 --> 00:39:37.933]  A wonderful mind, a future.
[00:39:38.373 --> 00:39:40.454]  Someone who's going to have dreams and a family.
[00:39:41.054 --> 00:39:41.614]  RUINED!
[00:39:42.515 --> 00:39:44.776]  BY YOU MURDERING, FLYING SCUM!
[00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:48.457]  But even if you don't believe me about
[00:39:50.692 --> 00:39:52.174]  How deadly all this stuff is.
[00:39:52.594 --> 00:39:56.919]  You can at least verify there's no law to take it, and they're lying to you!
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.162]  Is it good when someone lies to you?
[00:39:59.422 --> 00:40:01.224]  Should you trust them when they lie to you?
[00:40:01.485 --> 00:40:03.147]  Especially about something medical?
[00:40:07.995 --> 00:40:12.377]  And I get upset, too, because I don't like being associated with a lot of the Patriot movement.
[00:40:12.437 --> 00:40:18.520]  I don't like being associated with all the kooks and the people full of disinfo and the crazy people and the infighters.
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.721]  This work is too important.
[00:40:21.921 --> 00:40:32.866]  You know, just because the mainstream media lies, and just because they spin and abscond and engage in all these other tricks, doesn't mean the entire alternative media is telling you the truth, either.
[00:40:33.502 --> 00:40:35.464]  And that's why I tell you, don't believe Alex Jones.
[00:40:35.584 --> 00:40:38.206]  I want you to go investigate the claims I make.
[00:40:39.507 --> 00:40:43.950]  I don't get up here and say, I've got a $4,000 magic machine that'll cure any ailment you got.
[00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:57.260]  I don't get up here and say, I've got, you know, and the sick part is, I sit there and I turn all that stuff down, but then I still have to be associated with all the people that don't.
[00:40:57.921 --> 00:40:59.482]  That's another thing that's got me so mad.
[00:40:59.542 --> 00:41:03.085]  I really want to just take this desk in here and just ram it through the wall
[00:41:04.614 --> 00:41:06.716]  I want to take this computer and just smash it!
[00:41:08.658 --> 00:41:09.678]  Just go to a song.
[00:41:09.718 --> 00:41:10.479]  I'm too mad to be on air.
[00:41:10.519 --> 00:41:11.340]  I'm not going to blow up.
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:18.326]  Get Renegades or get, uh, or Everybody Knows or something we haven't played in a while.
[00:41:20.067 --> 00:41:20.968]  I may not even do the show.
[00:41:20.988 --> 00:41:22.029]  I may just go off air right now.
[00:41:22.709 --> 00:41:23.430]  This isn't a joke.
[00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:24.551]  This isn't a game, okay?
[00:41:25.071 --> 00:41:32.638]  I want people to consciously have it hit them like a bullet between the eyes how sick and degraded and falling apart our society is.
[00:41:34.978 --> 00:41:42.564]  We're in major crisis, and they're killing people all around us, and they're running bio-attacks and chemical attacks right here in the United States.
[00:41:44.125 --> 00:41:44.886]  We'll be back in a minute.
[00:41:47.325 --> 00:41:50.908]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[00:41:50.988 --> 00:41:54.531]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[00:41:54.751 --> 00:41:56.833]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[00:41:56.853 --> 00:41:58.534]  Everybody knows a good guy's lost.
[00:42:13.185 --> 00:42:17.347]  Everybody knows the fight was fixed.
[00:42:17.407 --> 00:42:21.549]  The poor stay poor, the rich get rich.
[00:42:21.709 --> 00:42:23.690]  That's how it goes.
[00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:25.551]  Everybody knows.
[00:42:30.414 --> 00:42:35.699]  Everybody knows that the boat is sinking.
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:39.964]  Everybody knows the captain lied.
[00:42:40.785 --> 00:42:44.929]  Everybody got this broken feeling.
[00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:48.853]  Like their father or their dog just died.
[00:42:49.927 --> 00:42:53.751]  Everybody cockin' to their pockets.
[00:42:54.532 --> 00:42:59.477]  Everybody wants some pops and chocolates and non-stim rolls.
[00:42:59.817 --> 00:43:01.019]  Everybody knows.
[00:43:09.824 --> 00:43:10.585]  I don't know.
[00:43:26.737 --> 00:43:36.625]  Everybody knows you've been discreet, but there were so many people you just had to meet without your clothes.
[00:43:36.725 --> 00:43:38.106]  And everybody knows.
[00:43:38.326 --> 00:43:39.767]  Everybody knows.
[00:43:49.792 --> 00:43:51.674]  Everybody knows.
[00:43:51.754 --> 00:43:53.435]  That's how it goes.
[00:43:53.555 --> 00:43:55.876]  Everybody knows.
[00:43:55.976 --> 00:43:59.799]  Everybody knows.
[00:43:59.899 --> 00:44:01.640]  Everybody knows.
[00:44:11.887 --> 00:44:13.588]  That's how it goes.
[00:44:13.668 --> 00:44:15.288]  Everybody knows.
[00:44:15.408 --> 00:44:19.790]  And everybody knows that it's now or never.
[00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:22.671]  Everybody knows that it's me or you.
[00:44:35.916 --> 00:45:00.394]  Everybody knows that you've lived forever Though when you've done a line or two Everybody knows the deal is rotten Old Black Joe still picking cotton for your ribbons and bows And everybody knows
[00:45:02.935 --> 00:45:07.398]  And everybody knows that the plague is coming.
[00:45:07.519 --> 00:45:12.282]  Everybody knows that it's moving fast.
[00:45:12.662 --> 00:45:20.688]  Everybody knows that the naked man and woman are just as shining artifacts of the past.
[00:45:21.828 --> 00:45:39.533]  Everybody knows the scene is dead, but there's gonna be a meter on your bed that will disclose what everybody knows.
[00:45:39.773 --> 00:45:43.754]  And everybody knows that you're in trouble.
[00:45:45.216 --> 00:46:07.777]  Everybody knows this is what you've been through From the bloody cross on top of Calvary To the beach of Malibu Everybody knows it's coming upon Take one last look at this sacred heart before it blows
[00:46:11.991 --> 00:46:14.412]  And everybody knows.
[00:46:14.552 --> 00:46:16.733]  Everybody knows.
[00:46:16.853 --> 00:46:21.916]  Everybody knows.
[00:46:21.976 --> 00:46:23.256]  That's how it goes.
[00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:48.810]  Everybody knows that something's wrong.
[00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:50.411]  Everybody knows there's a threat.
[00:46:51.652 --> 00:46:55.433]  But everybody does not know the nature of it or just how serious it is.
[00:46:55.453 --> 00:46:56.834]  I try
[00:46:58.306 --> 00:47:03.967]  And I research, and I work to understand the full scope of it, and I can't even grasp its dark majesty.
[00:47:05.707 --> 00:47:10.968]  I can't even fathom just how cold-blooded and powerful these people are.
[00:47:13.689 --> 00:47:15.929]  All I know is we're in the crosshairs.
[00:47:16.169 --> 00:47:25.571]  Every man, woman, and child, black, white, old, young, cop, auto mechanic, school teacher, FBI agent, government diplomat,
[00:47:27.037 --> 00:47:29.959]  CEOs, stockbrokers, lawyers.
[00:47:32.461 --> 00:47:34.902]  All I know is, man, these people are messing us up.
[00:47:34.962 --> 00:47:36.083]  They are attacking us.
[00:47:36.103 --> 00:47:37.043]  They are hurting us.
[00:47:37.544 --> 00:47:43.507]  They are, I mean, the stuff we know is so horrible and off the charts that it's a mountain.
[00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:49.851]  But imagine what we don't know.
[00:47:50.012 --> 00:47:52.013]  Imagine how much worse it is.
[00:47:53.093 --> 00:47:55.455]  Who knows what reality even is at this point?
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:24.891]  I know this though, if we try to investigate, if we try to fight back, if we simply stand up and shake off the illusion that's the mainstream media and the culture and all of the garbage that's being pushed, and if we just get serious and start looking around us and start researching, in every direction you can imagine, we can defeat these people.
[00:48:25.371 --> 00:48:26.532]  Or we can just let them win.
[00:48:28.709 --> 00:48:29.809]  And they've stated what that is.
[00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:31.490]  A global, tyrannical government.
[00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:50.696]  Everything you do, everything you buy, everything you sell, everything you think, everything you do, tracked, controlled, traced, poisoned, dumbed down, drugged out of your mind, implanted with cancer, the killing fields, all done in a concerted, ratcheted up effort.
[00:48:53.216 --> 00:48:54.777]  You have a choice, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:57.822 --> 00:49:15.937]  That's one big thing the New World Order's got going for them is the things they're doing are so off the charts, are so amazing, is so cold-blooded and well thought out and so finely tuned that the average person just can't even imagine it.
[00:49:15.997 --> 00:49:20.121]  But it's institutions that have been doing this for hundreds of years
[00:49:21.132 --> 00:49:26.156]  And they make mistakes, but they readjust, and they've had lots of failures, and lots of their info's leaked out.
[00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:34.923]  They're not perfect, but they got the high ground, they got finance, they control the currencies, they control the issuance of credit, and that's why they're so powerful.
[00:49:35.263 --> 00:49:38.226]  It's that inexorable, terrible strength.
[00:49:39.567 --> 00:49:43.050]  I mean, it's like trying to arm-wrestle, you know, a thousand-pound gorilla.
[00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:45.932]  We're strong, folks, but we just can't beat them.
[00:49:48.146 --> 00:49:52.830]  That is, we can't beat them if we just individually try to go out and face the whole thing down.
[00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:58.655]  But we can wake up others, and together we can surmount with God's help.
[00:49:58.755 --> 00:50:01.497]  And God is greater than this thousand-pound gorilla.
[00:50:02.358 --> 00:50:06.481]  But our churches are almost completely sold out and in the New World Order's clutches.
[00:50:12.426 --> 00:50:13.967]  I mean, at a certain point, it's just...
[00:50:16.132 --> 00:50:17.513]  It's just amazing to watch them.
[00:50:17.533 --> 00:50:18.373]  I mean, how could you?
[00:50:19.374 --> 00:50:21.715]  How could you send vaccines into the third world?
[00:50:21.735 --> 00:50:23.136]  Or right into the U.S.?
[00:50:27.378 --> 00:50:33.702]  But see, hospitals don't want to pump the kids full of HIV here, because their doctors and nurses and epidemiologists and virologists would find out.
[00:50:34.122 --> 00:50:38.505]  Here they have to do soft kill mercury and virus fragments and other things.
[00:50:39.845 --> 00:50:44.228]  And cancer viruses that activate later after a certain level of cell replication.
[00:50:47.228 --> 00:50:51.250]  Natural hormonal DNA strand breakage.
[00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:59.453]  But man, where they got control of the third world, they're in a deeper phase of extermination and it's wall-to-wall.
[00:51:01.894 --> 00:51:03.315]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:04.375 --> 00:51:05.416]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.136 --> 00:51:10.418]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful group of government.
[00:51:11.018 --> 00:51:12.839]  It's known as the Builderbirds.
[00:51:13.859 --> 00:51:16.020]  Both their objective being world domination,
[00:51:16.624 --> 00:51:19.066]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:19.807 --> 00:51:27.134]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.163 --> 00:51:35.146]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.607 --> 00:51:39.089]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.469 --> 00:51:41.991]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[00:51:42.051 --> 00:51:43.192]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.212 --> 00:51:43.972]  They're not after money.
[00:51:43.992 --> 00:51:45.053]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.273 --> 00:51:46.014]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.254 --> 00:51:47.295]  That's what they're after, you see.
[00:51:47.415 --> 00:51:55.600]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.902]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:58.942 --> 00:51:59.963]  You have been warned.
[00:52:00.803 --> 00:52:03.824]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:04.144 --> 00:52:09.066]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:13.668]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:13.968 --> 00:52:22.871]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.091 --> 00:52:26.692]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:26.992 --> 00:52:32.035]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.315 --> 00:52:39.059]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:39.539 --> 00:52:40.080]  What about you?
[00:52:40.837 --> 00:52:46.200]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:53:00.535 --> 00:53:05.117]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:53:05.517 --> 00:53:08.438]  Soon, it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:53:08.759 --> 00:53:11.320]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:16.502]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:53:16.902 --> 00:53:22.265]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:53:22.565 --> 00:53:25.526]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:53:25.706 --> 00:53:26.286]  We're good to go.
[00:53:49.119 --> 00:53:49.359]  We're good.
[00:54:21.658 --> 00:54:23.759]  You know, this song sounds good.
[00:54:23.799 --> 00:54:24.759]  Just fly away.
[00:54:24.779 --> 00:54:34.283]  I wish that I could fly, into the sky, somewhere high, just like a dragonfly.
[00:54:36.244 --> 00:54:45.908]  I'd fly from the trees, over the sea, and I'll be free, to anywhere I please.
[00:54:54.964 --> 00:54:55.565]  We're good to go.
[00:55:20.805 --> 00:55:28.068]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.241]  We can't fly away.
[00:55:49.082 --> 00:55:52.625]  Our society will degenerate and fall apart around us.
[00:55:54.766 --> 00:55:58.750]  No, we have to put our thoughts into actions.
[00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:00.391]  Yes, we have a beautiful planet.
[00:56:01.372 --> 00:56:03.293]  Wonders all around us.
[00:56:04.794 --> 00:56:09.618]  But the wicked New World Order system has taught us to take all of that for granted.
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:12.701]  It has taught us to not
[00:56:13.659 --> 00:56:21.445]  Love each other, to not care about each other, it's taught us to be immoral, one step at a time, to compromise ourselves until we're destroyed.
[00:56:23.526 --> 00:56:35.335]  But the good news is the people are waking up, they are rising up, though they can't even begin, the people I see just now waking up, to fathom those of us that have been digging into this for a long time just how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[00:56:36.795 --> 00:56:51.899]  So there's a lot of positive things happening, but every time I read hundreds of documents and news articles, how they're murdering little kids, mainly, all over the planet with these vaccines, and just a lion trash everywhere saying it's the law, it just, it just, I can't help it.
[00:56:52.479 --> 00:56:55.159]  I'm a primitive person at a certain level, and I just get mad.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.680]  And, uh, it just makes me sick with anger.
[00:56:59.761 --> 00:57:01.401]  Sick with anger and disgust.
[00:57:03.931 --> 00:57:07.813]  I just start wanting to get my hands around these people's throats, and that's not how we're going to win this thing.
[00:57:07.833 --> 00:57:13.077]  We've got to wake the cattle up first, ladies and gentlemen, so we can defeat the New World Order.
[00:57:14.057 --> 00:57:16.679]  I mean, they have turned evil into an art form of science.
[00:57:16.719 --> 00:57:18.480]  They have gone where no man's gone before.
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:21.181]  They've brought it to levels this globe has never before seen.
[00:57:21.482 --> 00:57:22.802]  There are new things under the sun.
[00:57:25.084 --> 00:57:26.945]  New manifestations that they've created.
[00:57:26.965 --> 00:57:28.966]  We're going to take your calls coming up in the next hour.
[00:57:28.986 --> 00:57:31.928]  I've got a bunch of other news I haven't even scratched the surface on yet.
[00:57:34.722 --> 00:57:54.353]  But before I end this hour, in the fight against the New World Order, information is the key, and I hope that a lot of you who haven't got an in-game blueprint for global enslavement that covers the North American Union, the EU, what the globalists are setting up physically, what their ideology is, why they want a world government so they can have their way with us.
[00:57:54.653 --> 00:58:03.398]  Bottom line, you think stuff's bad now, this is all just a taste, this is all just a leading edge, this is all just a probe.
[00:58:04.099 --> 00:58:08.780]  This is all just a dalliance compared to the real deal.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:13.601]  This is like a thousand pound meteor hitting the earth when there's a million ton one coming.
[00:58:14.742 --> 00:58:18.323]  As bad as you think this stuff is, this is nothing compared to the dark dreams of these people.
[00:58:19.363 --> 00:58:24.964]  So go to InfoWars.com, get in game today, and make copies of it, get it out to everybody you know.
[00:58:25.644 --> 00:58:26.665]  InfoWars.com.
[00:58:26.685 --> 00:58:28.365]  By the way, the Bilderberg Group have been out of stock.
[00:58:29.145 --> 00:58:31.706]  It's now in stock, and now shipping out.
[00:58:32.569 --> 00:58:36.555]  And, uh, we've got a couple hundred extra copies of your order in for the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:36.835 --> 00:58:37.757]  The book has been out of stock.
[00:58:37.777 --> 00:58:38.798]  It's still out of stock everywhere.
[00:58:38.818 --> 00:58:39.639]  We were the first to get it.
[00:58:43.004 --> 00:58:44.907]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.349 --> 00:58:48.352]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:57.984 --> 00:58:58.664]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.284 --> 00:59:00.385]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.065 --> 00:59:02.205]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.825 --> 00:59:03.645]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.385 --> 00:59:05.346]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.966 --> 00:59:09.766]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.126 --> 00:59:14.267]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.408 --> 00:59:22.249]  We need, if we're going to set about fixing our society and our planet, to really assess how serious things are.
[00:59:23.417 --> 00:59:26.478]  And not just old governments around the world, including the U.S.
[00:59:26.498 --> 00:59:32.801]  government, have killed tens of thousands of their own citizens in declassified chemical, biological, and radiological experiments.
[00:59:33.201 --> 00:59:37.002]  Let's just all trust them now and take their vaccines and shots, and everything's wonderful.
[00:59:40.104 --> 00:59:41.824]  I mean, we gotta address and assess this.
[00:59:41.884 --> 00:59:44.345]  I was about to go to Rishi in New Orleans, but he hung up.
[00:59:44.405 --> 00:59:46.186]  Rishi, if you call back, I'll put you ahead of the line.
[00:59:46.206 --> 00:59:46.726]  You been holding?
[00:59:47.307 --> 00:59:48.187]  I wanted to talk to you.
[00:59:49.076 --> 00:59:51.697]  Maggie, Paul, Ted, Andrea, many others that are holding.
[00:59:51.717 --> 00:59:53.178]  We're taking your calls now in the shower.
[00:59:54.019 --> 00:59:56.240]  I got a bunch of other news I'll cover after we do that.
[00:59:56.620 --> 01:00:00.442]  Consensus shattered as major scientific study says global warming is natural.
[01:00:01.282 --> 01:00:05.705]  White House Press Secretary admits she did not know what Cuban Missile Crisis was.
[01:00:07.786 --> 01:00:13.369]  Of course it turns out that the guy at the church in Colorado was only to kill two people.
[01:00:13.449 --> 01:00:15.710]  He had two guns and over a thousand rounds of ammo.
[01:00:17.412 --> 01:00:20.873]  Fully festooned with weapons and ammo and clips.
[01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:26.796]  This is another incredible story.
[01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:33.138]  I read three or four articles about how this woman stopped it and none of the mainstream articles said how she stopped him.
[01:00:33.719 --> 01:00:37.480]  And I finally found an article saying she went up and shot him.
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.881]  That's media control right there.
[01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:42.742]  They don't want you in that image of somebody shooting and killing somebody.
[01:00:42.782 --> 01:00:44.283]  Thank God they had an armed security guard.
[01:00:46.596 --> 01:00:49.438]  Same thing would happen in these malls if they armed those security guards.
[01:00:51.519 --> 01:00:54.441]  Alright, I've already digressed.
[01:00:54.481 --> 01:00:55.522]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:00:55.582 --> 01:00:56.482]  It's just, that's what I mean.
[01:00:56.522 --> 01:00:57.983]  I'm just sick of all the lying.
[01:00:58.384 --> 01:01:00.725]  And I realize the general public doesn't know how to assess these lies.
[01:01:00.805 --> 01:01:02.126]  I immediately see all this.
[01:01:02.706 --> 01:01:05.208]  I'm going, wait a minute, there's all these articles about this woman saved people.
[01:01:05.268 --> 01:01:06.149]  I read three of them.
[01:01:06.849 --> 01:01:07.590]  Big articles.
[01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:09.931]  And it never said how she did it.
[01:01:09.951 --> 01:01:11.692]  It said she took him down and won.
[01:01:12.112 --> 01:01:14.334]  And I finally found one saying she blew him away.
[01:01:16.238 --> 01:01:19.940]  I mean, that's a pretty important piece of the news article that she used her, her boomer.
[01:01:24.382 --> 01:01:26.243]  See, I just, I just got a headache even worse.
[01:01:26.343 --> 01:01:27.083]  I'm sorry, folks.
[01:01:27.123 --> 01:01:30.445]  I'm almost like, I'm almost like getting an allergy to fighting the new world order.
[01:01:30.465 --> 01:01:35.267]  I'm almost getting to where, used to I'd just yell and scream, and now I don't even yell and scream, I just get mad.
[01:01:35.687 --> 01:01:37.688]  Even madder than I would if I was yelling and screaming.
[01:01:38.188 --> 01:01:41.050]  Yelling and screaming is a release!
[01:01:44.612 --> 01:01:45.312]  Oh, heaven help us.
[01:01:46.994 --> 01:01:49.076]  Maggie in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:01:49.536 --> 01:01:50.537]  Well Alex, good morning.
[01:01:50.917 --> 01:01:54.199]  I almost feel sick myself now because of all this.
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:02:05.908]  I've been doing a lot of research into the vaccine and autism issue and I wanted to mention a couple of things I've come across in the last two weeks.
[01:02:06.388 --> 01:02:15.275]  Just yesterday there was an article, I found the article, it stated December 6th, Scientific American or Scientific American Online,
[01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:18.232]  Is there really an autism epidemic?
[01:02:18.732 --> 01:02:21.994]  And, of course, they poo-poo the idea that there is an autism epidemic.
[01:02:22.014 --> 01:02:23.095]  Yeah, I've seen the story.
[01:02:23.115 --> 01:02:23.855]  Yeah.
[01:02:24.576 --> 01:02:31.581]  Okay, now... Yeah, I mean, you know, 20 years ago, at a 5A public school, there wouldn't be one autistic child.
[01:02:31.641 --> 01:02:38.405]  And now, on average, they've got about 15% of their class that's in special ed, and about half of those are autistic.
[01:02:38.425 --> 01:02:41.487]  So, yeah, just multi-thousand percentile increase.
[01:02:42.068 --> 01:02:42.748]  Federal numbers.
[01:02:42.788 --> 01:02:43.609]  Yeah, there's no problem.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.601]  Yes.
[01:02:47.642 --> 01:03:04.253]  And I also belong to an autism support group or a news group of mostly parents who have autistic children, especially ones who have the intestinal issues associated with it.
[01:03:05.354 --> 01:03:06.835]  By the way, that's documented.
[01:03:06.875 --> 01:03:08.136]  It's always the chicken pox.
[01:03:09.345 --> 01:03:15.427]  Shot or others, and it goes and embeds itself, and they always are positive for the virus that was, quote, contaminating.
[01:03:15.987 --> 01:03:18.488]  It's like putting milk in your coffee and saying it was contaminated.
[01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:19.629]  No, you meant to put it in there.
[01:03:20.489 --> 01:03:22.130]  And, uh, that's it every time.
[01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:25.951]  Crohn's disease, absolute mainline medical evidence that it's the shots.
[01:03:27.091 --> 01:03:29.532]  I got somebody in my office who almost died from it.
[01:03:29.552 --> 01:03:31.813]  Had to have surgery last year.
[01:03:34.849 --> 01:03:35.609]  Stay there, Maggie.
[01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:36.650]  That's what I mean.
[01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:39.551]  It's just everywhere, and I'm sick of it!
[01:03:41.232 --> 01:03:42.052]  You don't believe me?
[01:03:42.912 --> 01:03:43.873]  Just go research.
[01:03:43.893 --> 01:03:47.754]  Type Crohn's disease linked to vaccines in.
[01:03:48.855 --> 01:03:49.875]  I'll do a search engine.
[01:03:49.915 --> 01:03:50.875]  Hold on to your hat.
[01:03:54.417 --> 01:03:55.837]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:56.898 --> 01:03:57.938]  A new world order.
[01:03:58.658 --> 01:04:02.100]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by power.
[01:04:09.141 --> 01:04:11.603]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:12.344 --> 01:04:19.690]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:22.674 --> 01:04:27.677]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:28.138 --> 01:04:31.600]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.522]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:04:34.562 --> 01:04:35.722]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:35.742 --> 01:04:36.503]  They're not after money.
[01:04:36.523 --> 01:04:37.563]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:37.804 --> 01:04:38.544]  They're after power.
[01:04:38.784 --> 01:04:39.605]  That's what they're after.

[01:05:59.858 --> 01:06:03.300]  Hemp, used for food, clothing and shelter since time began.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:10.725]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[01:06:11.065 --> 01:06:14.329]  Our Founding Fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:18.455]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.

[01:06:54.415 --> 01:07:00.058]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.982 --> 01:07:11.045]  Hi, we're back live with Maggie, Paul, Ted, Andrea.
[01:07:11.125 --> 01:07:17.429]  But Dean in Russia, I want to skip ahead to that caller here in a minute, but finish up with what you were saying, Maggie, in Texas.
[01:07:18.029 --> 01:07:18.930]  Oh yeah, okay.
[01:07:19.090 --> 01:07:20.450]  Also, since you had
[01:07:23.615 --> 01:07:25.316]  Talked about the chickenpox vaccine.
[01:07:25.356 --> 01:07:31.841]  I believe that also the measles vaccine has... It's in all of them.
[01:07:31.921 --> 01:07:33.722]  It's bioweapons, period.
[01:07:34.262 --> 01:07:34.662]  Okay.
[01:07:35.643 --> 01:07:44.069]  Well, anyway, one of the members of this news group sent around a very interesting video clip.
[01:07:44.109 --> 01:07:53.375]  It's about nine minutes long, and it shows a man who worked for Merck and was a major vaccine inventor.
[01:07:54.116 --> 01:08:08.504]  His name was Maurice Hilleman describing how Merck polio vaccines had become contaminated with cancer viruses, the SV40, and he is on film saying that.
[01:08:08.724 --> 01:08:10.505]  Particularly deadly.
[01:08:10.605 --> 01:08:12.586]  I've seen that.
[01:08:12.626 --> 01:08:15.727]  Send it again to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:08:15.988 --> 01:08:16.588]  Yeah, I will.
[01:08:17.068 --> 01:08:17.949]  Maybe we'll even play it.
[01:08:19.088 --> 01:08:19.648]  Debatable.
[01:08:20.649 --> 01:08:21.910]  But see, there's so many facets.
[01:08:22.050 --> 01:08:24.412]  You know, you call in and you mention the intestines.
[01:08:25.912 --> 01:08:27.273]  The upper and lower intestine.
[01:08:28.174 --> 01:08:32.177]  In most of the autistic children, you know, they claim it just mentally.
[01:08:32.357 --> 01:08:33.457]  Oh, you were deformed.
[01:08:34.058 --> 01:08:36.079]  That's why, you know, there's something wrong with your brain.
[01:08:36.659 --> 01:08:37.080]  Oh, really?
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:43.284]  Well, why do most of them, in fact the majority, have the intestinal problems in the whole Crohn's type class?
[01:08:43.324 --> 01:08:47.266]  See, again, 30 years ago, Crohn's had just been discovered.
[01:08:47.747 --> 01:08:48.067]  Now,
[01:08:48.979 --> 01:08:52.385]  There are people all over the place got Crohn's, and they can't eat!
[01:08:52.866 --> 01:08:58.196]  And they end up laying on the floor, and they can't even drink water, and they gotta go have yards of their guts cut out!
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:26.249]  And then they've done all these major scientific university studies, and lo and behold, there are different viruses, different types of autoimmune viruses, that are embedding in the gut, that are incontaminated in the vaccines, and again, that's a fact, but the average public doesn't even know how a vaccine works, doesn't know how to look that up, doesn't know which country we're in, literally, just... That's what's so angry, and that's why I'm so mad!
[01:09:26.289 --> 01:09:27.610]  It's like it's out of control!
[01:09:29.611 --> 01:09:30.371]  Anything else, Maggie?
[01:09:33.013 --> 01:09:43.997]  Well, I'll just mention that on this tape, you can hear the interviewer snickering in the background when he talks about how his vaccine brought AIDS to Africa.
[01:09:46.038 --> 01:09:47.819]  Send it on over, I'm aware of that gentleman.
[01:09:48.739 --> 01:09:50.900]  Yeah, one of the main people with the polio shot.
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:56.663]  Yeah, he died a couple of years ago, and I think the interview was taken earlier, maybe in the mid-80s.
[01:09:57.223 --> 01:09:58.344]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:09:58.424 --> 01:09:59.124]  One last thing, yeah.
[01:09:59.508 --> 01:10:05.089]  Yeah, I'm still very interested in closely following the story of Dr. Wakefield, who
[01:10:05.962 --> 01:10:12.126]  Um, brought up the intestinal issues with the MMR and autism with the MMR vaccine.
[01:10:12.526 --> 01:10:14.527]  And he's partly based in Austin.
[01:10:14.767 --> 01:10:20.891]  I would, if you don't have time to follow... You know, I've had Wakefield on before and he's a British doctor, got run out of England, right?
[01:10:20.991 --> 01:10:21.551]  Right.
[01:10:21.751 --> 01:10:22.752]  He's in Austin now.
[01:10:22.872 --> 01:10:23.592]  What's his first name?
[01:10:24.132 --> 01:10:24.433]  Andrew.
[01:10:24.833 --> 01:10:25.533]  Andrew Wakefield.
[01:10:25.633 --> 01:10:25.893]  Uh-huh.
[01:10:26.093 --> 01:10:29.195]  If you don't have time to follow that person... No, I will.
[01:10:29.315 --> 01:10:29.635]  I will.
[01:10:29.916 --> 01:10:30.476]  Thanks for the call.
[01:10:30.516 --> 01:10:32.617]  I gotta move or I'll never get to everybody else.
[01:10:32.977 --> 01:10:34.018]  But let me just bring this up.
[01:10:36.507 --> 01:10:43.912]  You have these autistic children also having their intestines attacked by the same virus.
[01:10:44.652 --> 01:10:46.033]  See, it's not just the mercury.
[01:10:47.554 --> 01:10:52.577]  And every time I talk to somebody and they see I've got an autistic child, or my sister does, I go, it's a boy, right?
[01:10:52.597 --> 01:10:53.077]  They go, yeah.
[01:10:53.938 --> 01:11:02.963]  And I was just talking to a medical doctor this weekend who said, oh yeah, we knew, you know, back in the 60s, she was an older lady, when I first became a doctor, that boys are many times more susceptible to mercury.
[01:11:03.948 --> 01:11:15.933]  They also to let heavy metals pass through the blood-brain barrier and other tissue blood barriers in the gut, similar tissues, in boys much more readily than women.
[01:11:16.313 --> 01:11:17.773]  Mainly because women give childbirth.
[01:11:17.953 --> 01:11:18.954]  Very tough, very rough.
[01:11:19.814 --> 01:11:24.916]  Women have better blood-brain barrier all the way around and they have better filtering systems because they have babies.
[01:11:25.911 --> 01:11:27.532]  That's why women live longer than men.
[01:11:27.712 --> 01:11:31.255]  Women, they'll tell you, it's a fact, it's a factual statistic.
[01:11:31.675 --> 01:11:36.618]  Across the world, female babies are many times stronger and more hardy.
[01:11:37.639 --> 01:11:40.380]  Because women got a tougher position in life.
[01:11:40.781 --> 01:11:42.202]  They're not physically as strong.
[01:11:43.062 --> 01:11:45.123]  And they have to go through childbirth.
[01:11:45.764 --> 01:11:46.865]  And so they're tough, folks.
[01:11:46.885 --> 01:11:47.665]  They're tough stuff.
[01:11:48.666 --> 01:11:50.687]  And this mercury goes right through your boys.
[01:11:51.368 --> 01:11:52.208]  Right through their guts.
[01:11:53.429 --> 01:11:54.970]  They've done studies in Japan where
[01:11:55.879 --> 01:11:56.199]  I don't think so.
[01:12:16.596 --> 01:12:24.784]  But the men are dying and they're finding massive, a lot of them go insane when they get older, in these fishing villages, because the mercury just builds up.
[01:12:25.184 --> 01:12:38.878]  Now, most of it's passed, because naturally occurring mercury, the way that humans are designed, the way that the fish are designed, that it binds it generally into the different proteins, and so most of it's passed.
[01:12:39.258 --> 01:12:40.940]  But still, naturally,
[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:53.324]  Men, when for a lifetime, and they've also got their fishing villages in Italy that show the same thing, fishing villages in Northern Europe that show the same thing, men get mercury poisoning much more easier.
[01:12:53.344 --> 01:12:54.645]  A lot easier.
[01:12:54.665 --> 01:12:56.805]  And that's just medical reports.
[01:12:58.286 --> 01:12:59.066]  That's just the facts.
[01:12:59.827 --> 01:13:03.308]  So you can go verify all that very, very quickly for yourself.
[01:13:04.448 --> 01:13:05.268]  But it's not just that.
[01:13:05.308 --> 01:13:09.610]  There's also viruses in these shots that are attacking the guts.
[01:13:10.858 --> 01:13:12.418]  Of these boys and some girls.
[01:13:14.259 --> 01:13:15.439]  I mean, Crohn's didn't exist.
[01:13:15.479 --> 01:13:16.079]  Now it's everywhere.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.460]  Diabetes was very, very rare.
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.920]  Now it's up 3,000 some percent.
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.021]  Cancer from 1 in 33 to 1 in 3.
[01:13:21.081 --> 01:13:22.681]  Autism from 1 in 2,000 plus to 1 in 75.
[01:13:22.721 --> 01:13:23.001]  Down from 168.
[01:13:23.041 --> 01:13:28.622]  I mean, it's pretty soon half the people are going to have it.
[01:13:28.642 --> 01:13:30.463]  I mean, they're going to say, that's nothing?
[01:13:37.486 --> 01:13:42.469]  And don't laugh at me, establishment Republicans and Democrats or cops or other people.
[01:13:42.509 --> 01:13:43.410]  Heaven forbid, man.
[01:13:44.631 --> 01:13:49.694]  I've had so many cops and people in the system who are trained to believe the system email me, call me, and go, you know what?
[01:13:49.734 --> 01:13:50.254]  I didn't believe you.
[01:13:50.294 --> 01:13:51.655]  We gave my child the third shot.
[01:13:51.695 --> 01:13:52.195]  He's gone.
[01:13:52.816 --> 01:13:53.897]  I'm like, I'm so sorry.
[01:13:54.297 --> 01:13:54.997]  I'm so sorry.
[01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:57.019]  God, I'm sorry.
[01:13:58.139 --> 01:13:59.840]  I'm sorry they're killers.
[01:14:00.261 --> 01:14:03.443]  I'm sorry you couldn't believe they do this to you, but they are.
[01:14:04.303 --> 01:14:06.825]  Hey, I'm sorry I'm having to risk my life to do this.
[01:14:08.052 --> 01:14:09.573]  Alright, I'm going to shut up and go to your calls.
[01:14:11.794 --> 01:14:12.595]  Who's up first?
[01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:13.836]  What's the caller from Russia?
[01:14:15.277 --> 01:14:17.318]  Vadim in Russia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:14:19.399 --> 01:14:19.920]  Hey Alex.
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:20.540]  Hi.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.741]  Hey, it's an honor to talk to you.
[01:14:23.702 --> 01:14:35.229]  Listen, gotta tell you quick, yesterday you were talking about one child policy and just a quick note that the Russian population is not 200 million, it's actually 145 million.
[01:14:38.232 --> 01:14:41.114]  Well, I guess they don't count the old Soviet Republic, so you're right.
[01:14:41.214 --> 01:14:52.620]  My point was, Russia doesn't have a one-child policy, but you're having like 1.1, 1.2 children, and so my point was, they're now having to pay people to have children, which I think is a good policy.
[01:14:53.701 --> 01:15:06.088]  Yes, well, but you know, Stalin and vaccines and AIDS and all that, and the economy killed off a bunch of people, but also, Chertoff is a son of the devil.
[01:15:07.017 --> 01:15:09.422]  Just for some people that, um, if they don't believe.
[01:15:09.442 --> 01:15:12.710]  Yeah, by the way, about four years ago, I heard that.
[01:15:14.485 --> 01:15:30.216]  I was about five years ago and I didn't believe it so I went to a Russian dictionary online it said one of the devil or son of the devil or the devil and there was three different meanings and then I went to another Russian dictionary and I asked a Russian one time on an airplane what Chertoff meant and he said of the devil so you're Russian tell us about it.
[01:15:30.356 --> 01:15:41.444]  Yes well Chort is actually the only son of the devil kind of like Jesus is the only son of God Chort is the only son of the devil
[01:15:42.153 --> 01:15:43.593]  Or Satan, whatever you want to call him.
[01:15:44.474 --> 01:15:48.315]  And he basically, he can have his own kids, right?
[01:15:48.395 --> 01:15:54.717]  And they can spread around and get inside people's bodies and become, well, Michael Chertoff.
[01:15:57.258 --> 01:15:58.658]  So that's the Russian lore.
[01:15:58.678 --> 01:16:00.879]  And so Chertoff, what does Toff mean?
[01:16:00.939 --> 01:16:01.279]  Sun?
[01:16:01.319 --> 01:16:01.839]  Sun Devil?
[01:16:01.879 --> 01:16:10.022]  Well, off is usually a preposition or the ending of Russian last names like Guchinovsky or Chertoff.
[01:16:10.646 --> 01:16:13.908]  So it's like Jones means son of Jonas, Chertoff means son of devil.
[01:16:14.228 --> 01:16:14.689]  There you go.
[01:16:16.129 --> 01:16:29.097]  And also, I've lived through two depressions, back home in 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, and 1998, when the ruble plunged.
[01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:37.843]  And I gotta tell people, and I'm trying to warn everybody, because people in America haven't really seen this for 80 years, you know, since the 30s.
[01:16:40.565 --> 01:16:46.048]  And, you know, back in 1998, I remember a time when there was no food at home at all.
[01:16:46.348 --> 01:16:46.988]  I mean, no food.
[01:16:47.008 --> 01:16:48.569]  You couldn't buy it in the stores.
[01:16:49.890 --> 01:17:04.037]  Back in 1998, when the Asian market's currency collapsed, you know, ruble was, you know, five rubles for every dollar one week, and then the next week it was
[01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:05.350]  30 rubles.
[01:17:05.831 --> 01:17:07.772]  Well, Americans say that can't happen here.
[01:17:07.792 --> 01:17:09.893]  And I keep hearing this info.
[01:17:10.293 --> 01:17:11.394]  Since 2000, it's lost 40%.
[01:17:13.315 --> 01:17:16.017]  But that's counting the euro at parity.
[01:17:16.057 --> 01:17:16.918]  The euro opened at 82.
[01:17:18.318 --> 01:17:21.520]  So it's really a 60% reduction versus the euro.
[01:17:21.821 --> 01:17:23.462]  Even worse, British Sterling.
[01:17:23.762 --> 01:17:24.422]  Yes, about 65%.
[01:17:25.503 --> 01:17:30.326]  And watch today at 2 p.m., 2.15 p.m.
[01:17:30.386 --> 01:17:31.006]  Eastern Time.
[01:17:31.486 --> 01:17:33.768]  Fed is going to destroy the dollar once again.
[01:17:35.034 --> 01:17:37.487]  And he's going to probably lower the rates.
[01:17:39.373 --> 01:17:41.294]  You're probably going to hit $1.50 today.
[01:17:41.314 --> 01:17:44.016]  Hey, back to this Chertoff thing.
[01:17:45.197 --> 01:17:48.579]  How would somebody give their family name, meaning son of the devil?
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:54.743]  I mean, people used to say, oh, I'm the son of Jonas, or I'm the son of John, or I'm the son of... It used to be popular.
[01:17:55.723 --> 01:18:07.811]  You had classes of societies that were rich, and they were perceived to be devilish because it was perceived that if you were rich, you had to be
[01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:12.492]  Yeah, because there was no capitalism back then, so it was all criminal.
[01:18:13.232 --> 01:18:17.133]  So if you were rich and famous, you were slaughtering people.
[01:18:18.334 --> 01:18:20.615]  And that's the only lost name you deserve.
[01:18:21.155 --> 01:18:23.255]  But, I don't know.
[01:18:25.356 --> 01:18:27.237]  Are there a lot of Chertoffs in your country?
[01:18:28.637 --> 01:18:28.898]  Yeah.
[01:18:29.398 --> 01:18:31.539]  I mean, it's a rare name.
[01:18:31.979 --> 01:18:33.759]  People usually embarrass me with a name like that.
[01:18:35.828 --> 01:18:38.531]  Also, I want to tell people that Putin is a dictator.
[01:18:39.492 --> 01:18:39.952]  Stay there.
[01:18:40.012 --> 01:18:42.935]  I want to let you continue your statements there, sir.
[01:18:42.955 --> 01:18:51.123]  And then I promise we're going to get to Paul, Ted, Andra, and others that are patiently holding right here on the GCN radio network.
[01:18:54.045 --> 01:18:57.948]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:18:58.168 --> 01:19:10.438]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:19:10.879 --> 01:19:11.279]  The U.S.
[01:19:11.319 --> 01:19:16.904]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:19:17.304 --> 01:19:19.506]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:19:21.367 --> 01:19:22.429]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:19:22.449 --> 01:19:25.312]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:19:25.412 --> 01:19:31.459]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[01:20:57.367 --> 01:21:04.272]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:21:04.652 --> 01:21:17.141]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000-year-old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[01:21:17.381 --> 01:21:19.983]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.

[01:21:42.918 --> 01:21:45.360]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:49.443]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:21:49.524 --> 01:21:50.424]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:22:08.759 --> 01:22:17.802]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[01:22:56.283 --> 01:23:12.178]  I hear the train a-comin' It's rollin' around the bend And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when I'm stuck in Folsom Prison And time keeps draggin' on
[01:23:15.919 --> 01:23:21.343]  But that train keeps a-rollin' all down the Salmon Coast.
[01:23:22.824 --> 01:23:31.351]  When I was just a baby, my mama told me, son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns.
[01:23:31.691 --> 01:23:36.975]  But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die.
[01:23:41.289 --> 01:23:54.915]  All right, let's go back to Vadim in Russia.
[01:23:55.615 --> 01:23:57.256]  Sir, you wanted to talk about Vladimir Putin.
[01:23:57.276 --> 01:23:57.656]  Go ahead.
[01:23:58.477 --> 01:24:00.318]  Yes, I just wanted to set the record straight.
[01:24:00.338 --> 01:24:02.859]  I don't know if some people are interested, but
[01:24:04.289 --> 01:24:13.412]  Basically, he is very popular and very popular among even the younger generation.
[01:24:14.812 --> 01:24:19.934]  What happened was we just came out of depression and he got in in 2008.
[01:24:21.215 --> 01:24:21.655]  I don't think so.
[01:24:44.591 --> 01:24:57.641]  Also, economy grew, quote-unquote, and so people associated that, that their material status increased, that it was all Putin's doings, which it's not.
[01:24:57.681 --> 01:24:59.102]  It's all artificial.
[01:24:59.182 --> 01:25:00.303]  There's no wealth, you know.
[01:25:01.424 --> 01:25:08.409]  People are in debt, so they got rid of the national debt to international banks, but they have their own central bank, and so people are in debt to it.
[01:25:10.583 --> 01:25:11.504]  Well, I know this.
[01:25:11.724 --> 01:25:15.066]  Mainline groups aren't allowed to demonstrate or protest in Russia.
[01:25:15.306 --> 01:25:20.069]  And he's got the secret police everywhere and they're killing reporters left and right.
[01:25:20.089 --> 01:25:23.171]  I mean, what would you call the system over there?
[01:25:23.211 --> 01:25:24.171]  Just robber barons?
[01:25:26.213 --> 01:25:28.814]  It's back to 1991.
[01:25:29.415 --> 01:25:30.836]  I mean, nothing changed.
[01:25:32.236 --> 01:25:32.777]  Corruption
[01:25:35.497 --> 01:25:40.599]  By the way, they have put the hammer and sickles three years ago back on all the troops' uniforms and the vehicles.
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.340]  It never went away, Alex.
[01:25:45.321 --> 01:25:46.182]  It never went away.
[01:25:46.542 --> 01:25:51.984]  The same people that were running this country in the 80s, you know, they have sons and daughters.
[01:25:52.044 --> 01:25:53.065]  They're running the country now.
[01:25:56.981 --> 01:26:00.902]  What do you think of Putin's new heir apparent he's appointing to be the next president?
[01:26:01.602 --> 01:26:02.382]  Yeah, Medvedev.
[01:26:03.242 --> 01:26:05.943]  It's going to be the same situation with Bush and Reagan.
[01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:07.743]  Only reversed, you know?
[01:26:08.844 --> 01:26:10.464]  He's going to put some puppet in there.
[01:26:10.884 --> 01:26:12.064]  Because Putin is not going away.
[01:26:12.524 --> 01:26:15.725]  Well, they admit he's still going to run the security services and the parliament.
[01:26:15.965 --> 01:26:17.725]  Yeah, and what are you going to do about it?
[01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:20.346]  He's got a 65% approval rating.
[01:26:21.486 --> 01:26:25.147]  And he puts in jail anybody who protests, so what are you going to do?
[01:26:26.158 --> 01:26:27.719]  Well, he calls it free speech zones.
[01:26:29.779 --> 01:26:31.140]  It's the same thing we've got here.
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.240]  Listen, call back in with reports from Russia.
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:34.221]  We appreciate your call, sir.
[01:26:35.481 --> 01:26:37.162]  Let's talk to Paul in Vancouver.
[01:26:37.202 --> 01:26:38.222]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:26:38.242 --> 01:26:40.163]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:40.503 --> 01:26:40.723]  Hi.
[01:26:41.503 --> 01:26:42.083]  Hi.
[01:26:42.123 --> 01:26:42.924]  Just really quick questions.
[01:26:43.424 --> 01:26:48.966]  Number one is, I notice you're on Myspace, but I notice that you're not on Facebook.
[01:26:49.926 --> 01:26:51.927]  Yeah, we need to start a Facebook account.
[01:26:51.967 --> 01:26:53.147]  We just don't have the personnel.
[01:26:54.201 --> 01:26:56.402]  Okay, well, that's what I do for a living.
[01:26:56.442 --> 01:26:58.662]  I work on Facebook, and I do Facebook apps and stuff.
[01:26:59.042 --> 01:27:01.563]  They've got something called Pages, too, now.
[01:27:01.743 --> 01:27:02.904]  Sort of like MySpace.
[01:27:04.884 --> 01:27:11.446]  If you just make a regular Facebook account, you're only allowed up to 5,000 friends, and I'm sure you would crack that, no problem.
[01:27:11.526 --> 01:27:17.288]  So if you were to make, like, maybe an official or something like that, Alex Jones or InfoWars page or something like that,
[01:27:17.995 --> 01:27:25.101]  Because there's a lot of people on Facebook, and there's a lot of people that are, you know, they know the truth, and there's a lot of people that... So what is that account we need to shut up?
[01:27:25.502 --> 01:27:30.566]  Well, it's called... they're called Facebook Pages, basically, and you'll see them right there when you go to the site.
[01:27:30.946 --> 01:27:32.167]  And they'll give those to anybody?
[01:27:32.187 --> 01:27:33.388]  Oh, yeah.
[01:27:33.569 --> 01:27:36.251]  Yeah, anybody can... they just released it, like, I guess last...
[01:27:36.821 --> 01:27:40.003]  No, I've been meaning to get on Facebook for six months.
[01:27:40.423 --> 01:27:45.205]  I'm so busy with films and radio shows and everything else we're doing, but we're going to do that.
[01:27:45.285 --> 01:27:46.866]  It is exploding right now.
[01:27:46.886 --> 01:27:48.687]  There's just so many people I'm sure you know.
[01:27:49.808 --> 01:27:51.489]  A couple other questions.
[01:27:51.569 --> 01:27:55.831]  You were talking about demoralization and the society falling apart and stuff.
[01:27:56.926 --> 01:27:58.307]  Yeah, I'm sure TV plays a big role.
[01:27:59.268 --> 01:28:10.074]  Do you think Fox deliberately tries to, like, demoralize people and, you know, shows like The Simpsons and Married with Children back in the day and, you know, that kind of garbage and stuff like that?
[01:28:10.094 --> 01:28:12.136]  Do you think Fox News is, like, a big contributor?
[01:28:12.356 --> 01:28:12.896]  Because I do.
[01:28:14.117 --> 01:28:16.398]  Fox News is a big contributor to the demoralization?
[01:28:16.899 --> 01:28:19.120]  Yeah, through TV and just basically, you know.
[01:28:20.081 --> 01:28:21.442]  Maybe just skip that question.
[01:28:22.682 --> 01:28:25.104]  Another thing, why doesn't Fox News have you on?
[01:28:26.085 --> 01:28:29.468]  I've been on there a few times, but not much, because I'll tear them up.
[01:28:29.508 --> 01:28:30.429]  I won't play their games.
[01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:34.353]  I'll tell them that they're in bed with Hillary Clinton, because they are.
[01:28:34.813 --> 01:28:36.875]  I'll shatter their false left-right paradigm.
[01:28:37.155 --> 01:28:37.816]  Anything else, sir?
[01:28:39.697 --> 01:28:40.098]  Stay there.
[01:28:40.118 --> 01:28:40.859]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.362 --> 01:28:45.303]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.743 --> 01:28:47.364]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.285 --> 01:28:50.988]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.219 --> 01:28:56.061]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:28:56.201 --> 01:29:01.385]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:29:01.565 --> 01:29:02.906]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:29:03.167 --> 01:29:11.354]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:29:11.574 --> 01:29:17.359]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:29:17.479 --> 01:29:19.220]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.422]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:29:21.602 --> 01:29:25.867]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:28.150]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:35.998]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:29:36.499 --> 01:29:37.000]  We're good to go.
[01:29:53.542 --> 01:29:57.785]  The holidays are here and that means extra food and extra weight gain.
[01:29:57.945 --> 01:30:00.527]  Why not make your New Year's resolutions healthier?
[01:30:00.687 --> 01:30:05.430]  And the easiest and most delicious way to start is with your new Excalibur Dehydrator.

[01:30:19.299 --> 01:30:22.581]  You can also use the Excalibur Dehydrator to make your own herbs.
[01:30:22.981 --> 01:30:25.142]  Spices in the comfort of your own kitchen.
[01:30:25.262 --> 01:30:27.482]  It's so easy your whole family can use it.
[01:30:27.662 --> 01:30:31.583]  Oh, and don't forget, the Excalibur Dehydrator makes the perfect Christmas gift.

[01:30:54.401 --> 01:30:57.842]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:30:58.062 --> 01:31:00.203]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:31:00.323 --> 01:31:02.783]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:31:03.044 --> 01:31:07.405]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[01:31:07.445 --> 01:31:08.125]  Here's why.
[01:31:08.525 --> 01:31:14.467]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:31:14.687 --> 01:31:20.709]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[01:31:20.929 --> 01:31:21.849]  But they're not cheating.
[01:31:22.089 --> 01:31:26.092]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:31:26.292 --> 01:31:30.615]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:31:30.715 --> 01:31:38.080]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:38.500]  We're good to go.
[01:32:04.887 --> 01:32:08.110]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:32:08.571 --> 01:32:11.033]  Run on for a long time.
[01:32:11.534 --> 01:32:13.916]  Run on for a long time.
[01:32:14.357 --> 01:32:16.899]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:19.782]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[01:32:22.043 --> 01:32:36.667]  Go tell that long-tongued liar Go and tell that midnight rider Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter Tell him that God's gonna cut him down Tell him that God's gonna cut him down
[01:32:41.821 --> 01:33:10.206]  Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news My head's been wet with the midnight dew I've been down on bended knee Talking to the man from Galilee He spoke to me in a voice so sweet I thought I heard the shuffle of angels sweep He called my name and my heart stood still When he said, John, go do my will Go tell that long-tongued liar Go and tell that midnight rider
[01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:23.732]  But now the churches tell us, Romans 13, we're to submit to the long-tongued liar.
[01:33:24.112 --> 01:33:25.833]  We're to go along with corruption.
[01:33:25.853 --> 01:33:27.494]  We're to rejoice in evil.
[01:33:28.394 --> 01:33:30.295]  Because it's of the Lord's will.
[01:33:30.315 --> 01:33:35.457]  It's predestined.
[01:33:35.537 --> 01:33:37.158]  It's a fraud out of the pit of hell.
[01:33:37.958 --> 01:33:39.938]  You know, most reporters aren't government agents.
[01:33:39.958 --> 01:33:51.701]  They're picked because they're establishment types who truly believe the false political map that's been integrated into their education, integrated into their worldview.
[01:33:52.661 --> 01:33:55.741]  And so it's just kooky to talk about the U.N.
[01:33:55.821 --> 01:33:58.702]  and others putting cancer, viruses, and AIDS in vaccines.
[01:33:58.722 --> 01:34:02.122]  It doesn't matter if it's in thousands of documents and come out over and over again.
[01:34:02.142 --> 01:34:05.203]  It doesn't matter if the actual medical reports
[01:34:06.219 --> 01:34:10.341]  Uh, say that HPV vaccine's killing a bunch of people, live cancer virus vaccine?
[01:34:12.942 --> 01:34:13.403]  Doesn't matter.
[01:34:14.323 --> 01:34:18.025]  I mean, the media won't even come out and say there's no law, you don't have to take shots!
[01:34:19.065 --> 01:34:21.947]  Just cause, well, the government says so, it must be a law!
[01:34:21.967 --> 01:34:29.070]  It's like they think there's a law, churches gotta sign up for 501c3 and be under federal control.
[01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:29.610]  There isn't!
[01:34:30.090 --> 01:34:31.171]  But they think so, folks.
[01:34:32.208 --> 01:34:32.748]  They think so.
[01:34:32.809 --> 01:34:36.711]  They believe anything they're told, and they go out and they repeat it.
[01:34:37.012 --> 01:34:40.154]  But now the public is finally starting to realize they've been lied to.
[01:34:41.295 --> 01:34:43.957]  The question is now, are we going to educate them?
[01:34:44.017 --> 01:34:48.920]  We're about to go back to Paul and Ted and Adra and Ed and Matt.
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:51.342]  I'm going to get to all of you in rapid succession as quickly as I can.
[01:34:51.802 --> 01:34:53.604]  All these callers bring up such important points.
[01:34:54.865 --> 01:34:56.606]  Christmas is here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:06.423]  And we put the Bilderberg Group, Club Bilderberg, by Daniel Eskelen, hundreds of pictures, documents, the history of the Bilderberg, the latest info.
[01:35:06.823 --> 01:35:10.605]  It's a great accompaniment to Endgame.
[01:35:10.665 --> 01:35:11.325]  They go together.
[01:35:12.125 --> 01:35:15.066]  Even some of the same photos that are in this, Eskelen gave us, are in Endgame.
[01:35:16.027 --> 01:35:21.089]  And we got a couple hundred of these, and before we turned around, it sold out, and we got a couple hundred back order.
[01:35:22.689 --> 01:35:27.351]  Well, they came in yesterday, and now we've got a surplus of them.
[01:35:29.039 --> 01:35:30.179]  And they are going quick.
[01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:33.100]  Everybody was a few weeks back-ordered.
[01:35:33.881 --> 01:35:39.843]  Nothing else was back-ordered but the true story of Bilderberg Group by Daniel Estelin.
[01:35:40.383 --> 01:35:44.464]  So any orders that we had that had that mixed in with it, or if you just ordered that, it was back-ordered.
[01:35:44.484 --> 01:35:45.104]  They're shipping out.
[01:35:45.764 --> 01:35:48.505]  They came in yesterday, we shipped half of them, we're shipping the rest today.
[01:35:48.565 --> 01:35:50.066]  So they're on their way to you.
[01:35:51.106 --> 01:35:56.768]  But for those that haven't ordered it yet, we have it in stock and we're watching it now.
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:01.843]  When we sell out of the couple hundred we got, we'll pull it off the shopping cart.
[01:36:01.863 --> 01:36:04.485]  And that might happen tomorrow, it might happen Friday, it might happen next week.
[01:36:04.846 --> 01:36:06.947]  But the way they're going, it's going to happen in a couple days.
[01:36:06.987 --> 01:36:09.069]  I'm trying to secure some more right now.
[01:36:09.129 --> 01:36:11.611]  This book is just super, super hot.
[01:36:13.252 --> 01:36:16.074]  Amazon still says they're out of stock when you go there.
[01:36:16.274 --> 01:36:18.036]  By the way, we have it discounted.
[01:36:18.056 --> 01:36:20.057]  19 bucks instead of 24.
[01:36:21.458 --> 01:36:21.979]  We've got it.
[01:36:22.059 --> 01:36:23.440]  We have it in stock.
[01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:25.582]  Nobody else does, because I threw a giant fit.
[01:36:26.022 --> 01:36:27.283]  They're great folks at the publisher.
[01:36:27.930 --> 01:36:29.471]  And said, look, I didn't know this was going to happen.
[01:36:29.491 --> 01:36:30.332]  I thought I could get more.
[01:36:30.652 --> 01:36:32.054]  So I had my first order in.
[01:36:32.074 --> 01:36:35.597]  I had them FedEx these from me right when they were printed.
[01:36:36.718 --> 01:36:38.339]  And so we've got them now.
[01:36:38.459 --> 01:36:42.322]  No one else has the Bilderberg Group by Daniel Estelin.
[01:36:43.763 --> 01:36:45.545]  It is a perfect Christmas present.
[01:36:45.605 --> 01:36:56.094]  So if you order it now, all orders through next Tuesday, you're guaranteed to get because if you order UPS, if you select USPS Postal Service,
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:00.483]  We will ship everything that comes in on that Monday out on that Tuesday.
[01:37:01.024 --> 01:37:03.105]  We'll ship everything that comes out on Tuesday out on Wednesday.
[01:37:04.266 --> 01:37:15.336]  But after that, I mean, you'll probably get it the day before Christmas if it's a USPS, but if it's FedEx, we'll ship it out on Tuesday, you'll get it on a Friday.
[01:37:16.057 --> 01:37:16.797]  We'll get it on a Saturday.
[01:37:16.817 --> 01:37:19.740]  You'll definitely get it before Christmas if it's in the middle of the next week.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:24.504]  So, I'm just telling everybody, if you're going to write to me, do it now.
[01:37:25.658 --> 01:37:27.979]  If that's how you're ordering, that takes four or five days to get your letter.
[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:31.761]  If you're going to order by phone, do it by next Tuesday.
[01:37:31.781 --> 01:37:34.983]  If you're going to order by internet, do it by next Tuesday.
[01:37:35.903 --> 01:37:48.310]  We need to use this chance of gift giving, instead of giving again somebody a bottle of whiskey, or a tie, or a fruit pie, or something they're not going to eat or don't want, or some sweater they wear once or in the right size, or just got a scratchy collar.
[01:37:50.292 --> 01:37:53.416]  I don't like sweaters.
[01:37:53.436 --> 01:37:55.418]  The point is, I like cotton sweaters.
[01:37:56.118 --> 01:37:56.759]  I'm digressing.
[01:37:56.779 --> 01:37:59.722]  I have a closet full of sweaters I've been given at Christmas.
[01:38:00.282 --> 01:38:02.004]  I'm not knocking family that gave them to me.
[01:38:02.104 --> 01:38:03.045]  It's just a fact.
[01:38:03.986 --> 01:38:04.947]  Give them Endgame.
[01:38:05.147 --> 01:38:06.989]  Give them Club Bilderberg.
[01:38:07.389 --> 01:38:10.092]  Give them loose change Final Cut, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:10.633 --> 01:38:11.934]  Loose change Final Cut.
[01:38:12.034 --> 01:38:12.815]  Perfect gifts.
[01:38:13.507 --> 01:38:14.448]  This Christmas season.
[01:38:14.808 --> 01:38:16.109]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:38:16.129 --> 01:38:18.230]  You can get big discounts on the book, on my film.
[01:38:18.250 --> 01:38:18.870]  You get them together.
[01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:22.092]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[01:38:22.112 --> 01:38:23.273]  888-253-3139.
[01:38:23.293 --> 01:38:32.638]  Or, for the month of December, we do this every year for the last three and a half years.
[01:38:33.759 --> 01:38:35.039]  This is our fourth offering.
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:37.581]  Hard to believe almost four years we've had the site.
[01:38:37.661 --> 01:38:38.722]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:38:38.842 --> 01:38:40.162]  All 17 of my films.
[01:38:40.363 --> 01:38:41.063]  Both my books.
[01:38:42.466 --> 01:38:46.169]  My book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV reports, just everything.
[01:38:46.449 --> 01:38:52.935]  Endgame 1.5, almost two hours of extras from Endgame that aren't on the DVD for PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[01:38:53.375 --> 01:39:04.544]  Get a $5.95 monthly membership, that's about 15 cents a day, or two cups of Starbucks coffee a month, or even better, get a yearly membership and get 5.3 months free.
[01:39:04.624 --> 01:39:11.249]  I just threw out a discount three years ago, same discount we have today that we do during Christmas, and it just came out to 5.3 months.
[01:39:12.919 --> 01:39:16.120]  Almost half a year free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:18.521]  And for all the members out there, I want to thank you for your support.
[01:39:18.821 --> 01:39:33.086]  Okay, that said, I do also want to thank all of our Eminem affiliates out there, whether it's our new affiliate in Memphis, or an affiliate we just got in New Mexico, or so many new affiliates.
[01:39:33.146 --> 01:39:34.186]  I just want to thank all of them.
[01:39:34.206 --> 01:39:40.708]  Be sure and support those affiliate sponsors, or if you have a local business, support them, become a sponsor, and help us spread the word.
[01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:49.145]  Because we're just trying to expand, get more webmasters, more researchers, redesign the sites, get better software for you.
[01:39:49.785 --> 01:39:51.086]  A lot of things we're trying to do.
[01:39:52.086 --> 01:39:54.688]  Truthnews.us and Infowars.net.
[01:39:55.588 --> 01:39:56.689]  We need your support.
[01:39:56.969 --> 01:39:58.850]  And that means getting the word out about the show.
[01:39:59.631 --> 01:40:03.473]  And I know that a lot of you do spread the word, but the majority of you don't really.
[01:40:06.878 --> 01:40:08.679]  I sincerely just want to reach more people.
[01:40:09.079 --> 01:40:10.980]  I mean, that is my burning desire.
[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:12.461]  It's why I do this.
[01:40:13.441 --> 01:40:14.882]  This is actually painful for me.
[01:40:21.164 --> 01:40:22.905]  All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
[01:40:22.925 --> 01:40:25.486]  I think I'm going to take off the whole wig for Christmas.
[01:40:25.506 --> 01:40:26.747]  I used to take it off just for Christmas.
[01:40:27.007 --> 01:40:27.507]  I'm out of here.
[01:40:32.165 --> 01:40:37.869]  I don't know how to explain it, I'm whining, but I'll go spend 2-3 hours studying every night on different issues, and I just get upset after it.
[01:40:38.690 --> 01:40:46.255]  And I just, it's, again, it's like watching your neighbor get their house robbed by the same person 10-15 times.
[01:40:47.095 --> 01:40:54.921]  And you've got all the evidence, they're the ones robbing the house, and you go over to warn your neighbor, and they're sitting there at the coffee table pouring the thief coffee, and the thief's saying you're bad.
[01:40:56.762 --> 01:40:58.904]  I mean, it's just, I want justice.
[01:40:59.818 --> 01:41:01.959]  I never knew what justice meant when I was a teenager.
[01:41:02.459 --> 01:41:03.059]  Oh, justice.
[01:41:03.239 --> 01:41:03.800]  Ha ha ha.
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:04.420]  What's that mean?
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:05.600]  Now I know what it means.
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:06.341]  I mean, justice.
[01:41:07.041 --> 01:41:09.562]  And there isn't a lot of justice in this world and it's getting worse.
[01:41:10.663 --> 01:41:18.226]  To answer Paul in Vancouver's question, of course Fox News is trying to degrade society.
[01:41:18.266 --> 01:41:19.066]  It's a policy.
[01:41:19.646 --> 01:41:20.387]  They're all doing it.
[01:41:20.407 --> 01:41:21.647]  Of course Fox TV shows.
[01:41:22.027 --> 01:41:25.969]  Have you seen anything more degrading to the male role model?
[01:41:27.328 --> 01:41:29.489]  On all these shows, it's all by design.
[01:41:29.529 --> 01:41:30.910]  We have the government documents.
[01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:44.495]  I've had professors and scientists at number two, Department of Education, on this show, to tell you, I mean, to give you where you can get the documents.
[01:41:44.555 --> 01:41:51.158]  I had some idiot email me yesterday saying, I'm making up right-wing propaganda about Margaret Sanger, that it's fake quotes.
[01:41:51.558 --> 01:41:53.859]  Listen to me, you stupid, mindless idiot.
[01:41:56.383 --> 01:42:04.106]  In Endgame, by the way, we didn't even spend much time on her, but in the research, I did hundreds of percentiles more research than I actually put in the film, because you can't put it all in.
[01:42:04.747 --> 01:42:15.311]  When I saw quotes from Margaret Sanger praising Hitler and Hitler praising her, and when I saw quotes of her saying black people are subhuman and stuff, we actually sent off to the universities.
[01:42:15.371 --> 01:42:17.692]  We actually went to where her papers are.
[01:42:18.472 --> 01:42:19.673]  We actually got them.
[01:42:20.613 --> 01:42:22.414]  So shut your mouth, you liar!
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:25.041]  How dare you self-defeat?
[01:42:25.061 --> 01:42:27.984]  I know you can't believe your icon is evil.
[01:42:37.054 --> 01:42:38.976]  Believe me, I wish this wasn't true.
[01:42:39.016 --> 01:42:40.818]  When I tell you that the
[01:42:44.446 --> 01:42:54.153]  Vaccines are absolutely causing the autism, and that most of these children, more than half, have the viruses that are also, quote, contaminated, attacking their gut, as the caller just mentioned.
[01:42:54.313 --> 01:42:55.453]  That's admitted fact!
[01:42:56.794 --> 01:43:05.940]  The major medical studies say, well, there's serious links in repeated studies that it's the vaccines attacking the gut and causing an autoimmune disease.
[01:43:07.181 --> 01:43:11.924]  Then your gut starts swelling up, your intestines swell up, and you can't get food down.
[01:43:12.865 --> 01:43:14.026]  And it ruins your life!
[01:43:18.727 --> 01:43:20.308]  That's just one thing of thousands!
[01:43:21.968 --> 01:43:23.689]  But you won't check out what I say.
[01:43:24.009 --> 01:43:25.869]  You'll just sit there and say I'm a liar.
[01:43:25.889 --> 01:43:30.010]  I gotta go to your calls.
[01:43:32.511 --> 01:43:33.532]  Paul, you have one more question.
[01:43:33.572 --> 01:43:33.832]  Go ahead.
[01:43:34.612 --> 01:43:39.413]  Yeah, um, actually, okay, Alex, I've been listening to you for the past two years.
[01:43:39.933 --> 01:43:40.894]  I am a web developer.
[01:43:42.274 --> 01:43:44.155]  I consider myself a professional web developer.
[01:43:44.195 --> 01:43:45.335]  I know exactly what I'm doing.
[01:43:45.775 --> 01:43:46.896]  You sent me an email, right?
[01:43:47.796 --> 01:43:48.116]  No, I didn't.
[01:43:48.823 --> 01:43:49.844]  I got a bunch of web developers.
[01:43:49.884 --> 01:43:50.284]  Well, fine.
[01:43:50.384 --> 01:43:53.185]  I just don't have time to tell people what to do with websites.
[01:43:53.225 --> 01:44:01.649]  When people want to build super awesome websites and everything that have templates we can update, build them, and I'll tell you what, people try to give them to me for free.
[01:44:01.929 --> 01:44:04.750]  If it's good and it works, I'll give you some money at the end of it.
[01:44:05.010 --> 01:44:08.752]  But I just don't have money to throw around, and I just don't have time to mess with it.
[01:44:09.952 --> 01:44:10.613]  Okay, fair enough.
[01:44:10.933 --> 01:44:12.633]  And okay, my last question, I know we've got a lot of calls.
[01:44:13.374 --> 01:44:17.916]  What if one million, two million people were to go outside the White House
[01:44:19.562 --> 01:44:28.899]  And, you know, to make a real change, a real difference, and demand that they want real change in America, that's the only way it's going to be done.
[01:44:28.999 --> 01:44:31.364]  Because, to me, people are lazy.
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:35.143]  They just want to sit behind the computer and watch what's going on.
[01:44:35.303 --> 01:44:45.311]  Yeah, about 800,000 farmers in the 70s in two different deals tried to go to the White House and they had riot police on video climb up in the cages and beat women and children with clubs in their heads.
[01:44:45.732 --> 01:44:50.976]  They don't allow giant marches up by the White House now because we live in a fiat dictatorship.
[01:44:52.697 --> 01:44:53.138]  That's sad.
[01:44:54.299 --> 01:44:58.222]  Or, if you had a million people converging, the feds would just detonate a truck bomb and say we did it.
[01:44:59.178 --> 01:45:00.019]  Well that's even sadder.
[01:45:31.122 --> 01:45:32.963]  And, uh, it's gonna be Web 2.0.
[01:45:33.143 --> 01:45:35.103]  By the time Web 3.0 comes out, we'll be Web 2.0.
[01:45:36.584 --> 01:45:38.704]  See, it's organizational.
[01:45:39.524 --> 01:45:45.746]  And I don't even have the time or energy to tell my people at work for me what to do, and quite a few of them actually know how to go out and get something done without me telling them.
[01:45:46.446 --> 01:45:47.406]  I mean, this isn't a joke.
[01:45:47.466 --> 01:45:48.587]  I just am sick of it all.
[01:45:51.467 --> 01:45:54.588]  I mean, it's just the point is, trying to even prove this stuff anymore is almost a joke.
[01:45:54.608 --> 01:45:55.228]  What's the point?
[01:45:55.308 --> 01:45:57.129]  We've got criminals just running all over us.
[01:45:58.231 --> 01:46:01.812]  Bunch of scum running around saying there's no North American Union.
[01:46:02.232 --> 01:46:03.452]  Just all of it makes me sick.
[01:46:03.472 --> 01:46:06.293]  Let me just tell you something, all you yuppie scum and the rest of you that love this stuff.
[01:46:07.513 --> 01:46:14.135]  When you're flopping around dying from cancer, your kid's retarded from this stuff, I'm sad it happened to you, but you should remember, I warned you.
[01:46:16.996 --> 01:46:21.077]  I warned you, and I warned you, and I... But the big deal is, I can't reach but a fraction of people.
[01:46:25.558 --> 01:46:27.259]  It's you that can reach the rest of the people.
[01:46:27.319 --> 01:46:28.720]  It's you that's going to have to take action.
[01:46:29.061 --> 01:46:29.841]  Ted in Texas.
[01:46:30.001 --> 01:46:30.882]  And then I've got to get to Adra.
[01:46:30.922 --> 01:46:31.483]  Ted, go ahead.
[01:46:31.503 --> 01:46:34.145]  Hi, Alex.
[01:46:34.465 --> 01:46:39.829]  I wanted to just expand a little bit on the story of AIDS in Africa.
[01:46:40.325 --> 01:46:46.308]  Did you guys ever report on the formula, the infant formula disaster in Botswana about six months ago?
[01:46:46.688 --> 01:46:51.251]  Well, they've been having an infant formula disaster here in the U.S., in Asia, everywhere.
[01:46:51.271 --> 01:46:58.915]  It's always kept very quiet, where they do not add the fatty acid to it, knowing that within two months the child will be irreparably brain damaged.
[01:46:59.195 --> 01:47:01.176]  But because it's a newborn, the parents can't tell.
[01:47:01.216 --> 01:47:02.417]  That's all done by design.
[01:47:02.797 --> 01:47:04.658]  They've also been caught adding poisons to them.
[01:47:05.358 --> 01:47:06.999]  Why don't you tell folks about the latest case?
[01:47:10.373 --> 01:47:10.633]  Ted?
[01:47:12.194 --> 01:47:13.134]  I didn't hang up on Ted.
[01:47:13.154 --> 01:47:13.994]  Did his phone hang up?
[01:47:16.915 --> 01:47:17.736]  Just let him go.
[01:47:18.336 --> 01:47:18.696]  I'm here.
[01:47:19.096 --> 01:47:19.476]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:19.496 --> 01:47:20.197]  You're on air, sir.
[01:47:20.677 --> 01:47:30.721]  Okay, uh, basically, um, what happened is, is, uh, UNICEF, who I didn't know who UNICEF was until I looked it up, and, of course, it's the United Nations Children Fund.
[01:47:31.001 --> 01:47:33.462]  And that's the group that helps the children.
[01:47:33.782 --> 01:47:34.202]  Oh, yeah.
[01:47:34.222 --> 01:47:35.022]  So here's what they did.
[01:47:35.102 --> 01:47:39.524]  Since 1997, they were pushing to, uh, bring infant formula
[01:47:40.373 --> 01:47:48.458]  To the women in Botswana because they wanted to reduce the transmission of AIDS from mothers.
[01:47:48.738 --> 01:47:58.324]  However, if you can quickly check that only 1 out of 100 infants actually get AIDS transmitted, it's practically zero.
[01:47:58.444 --> 01:48:01.466]  AIDS is very, very weak until you get it into your body.
[01:48:02.106 --> 01:48:05.549]  So they had this huge publicity campaign and
[01:48:06.542 --> 01:48:08.543]  Long story short, you can Google it.
[01:48:08.683 --> 01:48:11.584]  It's a Botswana infant formula disaster.
[01:48:12.884 --> 01:48:19.546]  They killed 90 out of every 100 children who switched over to the formula due to diarrhea.
[01:48:19.706 --> 01:48:21.607]  So it's a known disaster.
[01:48:21.647 --> 01:48:23.027]  It got buried pretty quick in media.
[01:48:23.047 --> 01:48:25.048]  But it's all done on purpose.
[01:48:26.488 --> 01:48:28.649]  I mean, they've got a new disaster every week.
[01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:30.209]  It's always, oh, it's an accident!
[01:48:30.549 --> 01:48:30.849]  Oopsie!
[01:48:30.869 --> 01:48:31.229]  Oopsie!
[01:48:33.786 --> 01:48:41.154]  This is by design, this is in-game to the T, it's all the same name, it's UNICEF and Rockefeller, I mean, come on.
[01:48:41.894 --> 01:48:50.904]  Well, I mean, look at how the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has got over 70 Bill, and they're giving most of it to UNICEF to help with special injections.
[01:48:52.625 --> 01:48:53.727]  It's so sick!
[01:48:54.147 --> 01:48:55.589]  It's completely sick, and it's
[01:48:56.525 --> 01:48:57.026]  It's there.
[01:48:57.186 --> 01:49:03.093]  You know, for the people who can't say it's there, I just want to keep providing more and more and more information.
[01:49:03.173 --> 01:49:04.835]  Dialogue is the initial goal.
[01:49:04.935 --> 01:49:07.798]  Well, I'll tell you what we need listeners to do who are web folks and researchers.
[01:49:07.838 --> 01:49:09.220]  Just go create a website.
[01:49:10.683 --> 01:49:16.487]  Uh, and, and, and just put the thousands of articles from all, they accidentally gave everybody in the village polio.
[01:49:16.507 --> 01:49:18.088]  They accidentally all gave them AIDS.
[01:49:18.348 --> 01:49:20.269]  They accidentally poisoned the formula.
[01:49:20.289 --> 01:49:25.012]  They accidentally, oh, and then all the documents where they said before they were going to do it by design.
[01:49:25.352 --> 01:49:27.653]  It's not like, heh, heh, that's the thing.
[01:49:28.754 --> 01:49:31.475]  People say, oh, the government's not a criminal, you're just putting a bad face on it.
[01:49:31.535 --> 01:49:32.776]  Give me a break!
[01:49:33.576 --> 01:49:34.177]  Anything else, sir?
[01:49:34.930 --> 01:49:35.390]  Yeah, I did.
[01:49:35.410 --> 01:49:37.152]  I wanted to touch on one other subject.
[01:49:37.212 --> 01:49:38.252]  I hear the music coming up.
[01:49:38.653 --> 01:49:41.715]  Yeah, we'll come back to you and Adria Hungup's sale I'll be.
[01:49:41.735 --> 01:49:43.276]  Yeah, and others.
[01:49:43.316 --> 01:49:44.177]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[01:49:44.197 --> 01:49:48.180]  There's a bunch of news I haven't even gotten to yet, but... Oh, man.
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:49.440]  There's no corruption in government.
[01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:50.041]  Everything's fine.
[01:49:54.184 --> 01:49:55.585]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:55.605 --> 01:49:57.706]  A new world order.
[01:49:58.427 --> 01:50:01.929]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by power.
[01:50:03.317 --> 01:50:05.037]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:50:05.377 --> 01:50:08.358]  Isn't their objective to beat world domination?
[01:50:08.918 --> 01:50:11.359]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:12.099 --> 01:50:19.620]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:22.441 --> 01:50:27.382]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:27.902 --> 01:50:31.363]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:31.743 --> 01:50:34.264]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[01:50:34.324 --> 01:50:35.465]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.485 --> 01:50:36.245]  They're not after money.
[01:50:36.265 --> 01:50:37.346]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:37.526 --> 01:50:38.266]  They're after power.
[01:50:38.326 --> 01:50:39.226]  That's what they're after, you see.
[01:50:39.686 --> 01:50:47.869]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:47.989 --> 01:50:50.830]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:50:51.171 --> 01:50:52.331]  You have been warned.
[01:50:53.024 --> 01:50:58.327]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey solar charger.
[01:50:58.527 --> 01:51:00.589]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:51:00.829 --> 01:51:07.973]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:51:08.093 --> 01:51:18.299]  The Berkey solar charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when
[01:51:18.399 --> 01:51:19.100]  We're good to go!
[01:51:45.538 --> 01:51:45.859]  We're good to go.
[01:51:54.517 --> 01:51:56.719]  Hey Dad, we need your help finishing the Christmas tree.
[01:51:56.899 --> 01:52:00.904]  Okay boys, I just got a few more Uncivil Liberties DVDs to ship out today.
[01:52:01.104 --> 01:52:02.826]  Why do you guys make Uncivil Liberties?
[01:52:02.926 --> 01:52:06.069]  You know how we like to look at those cool illustrations on rents.com?
[01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:07.510]  Yeah, David Dees rocks.
[01:52:07.731 --> 01:52:08.892]  I like the chips one.
[01:52:09.032 --> 01:52:10.573]  Well those aren't chocolate chips.
[01:52:10.874 --> 01:52:15.559]  Those are little tracking devices the government wants to put under our skin someday to track us.
[01:52:15.699 --> 01:52:17.881]  You mean the government's not the good guys?
[01:52:18.041 --> 01:52:19.342]  Well, they should be the good guys.
[01:52:19.442 --> 01:52:22.023]  They're supposed to do what we the people say they should do.
[01:52:22.203 --> 01:52:26.705]  But these days, the people are too busy watching their favorite TV shows to keep an eye on the government.
[01:52:26.825 --> 01:52:28.225]  You mean like SpongeBob?
[01:52:28.546 --> 01:52:29.346]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:52:29.686 --> 01:52:35.128]  So we made on civil liberties to help remind everyone to keep an eye on what's happening, not to fall asleep.
[01:52:35.348 --> 01:52:35.849]  Asleep?
[01:52:36.269 --> 01:52:37.849]  It's not even bedtime yet!

[01:53:08.338 --> 01:53:11.654]  Some folks are born to make the way to fly.
[01:53:16.664 --> 01:53:17.945]  We're back live.
[01:53:18.405 --> 01:53:20.206]  Belvin Thompson today.
[01:53:20.266 --> 01:53:27.851]  I've been crawling along Thurman and covering a lot of key points.
[01:53:46.878 --> 01:53:49.219]  You know, it's like my life's been stolen, is really what it is.
[01:53:49.239 --> 01:53:52.340]  And it's positive that I get to fight it, and it's very rewarding and fulfilling.
[01:53:53.141 --> 01:53:55.122]  But at the same time, the innocence is stolen.
[01:53:55.642 --> 01:54:05.967]  To know that psychopathic, genius, murdering killers run the whole planet, and are doing everything they can in an organized incrementalism to poison us, give us cancer, exterminate us, hurt us.
[01:54:06.747 --> 01:54:10.729]  It's absolute stated fact, they're publicly doing it, and I'm just not going to stand around anymore.
[01:54:10.769 --> 01:54:11.569]  This is serious.
[01:54:12.570 --> 01:54:13.390]  This is serious.
[01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:14.851]  I know I keep saying that.
[01:54:15.550 --> 01:54:18.553]  For the new listeners out there, you better check into what we're saying.
[01:54:20.454 --> 01:54:24.278]  All right, we were talking to Ted in Texas.
[01:54:24.298 --> 01:54:25.179]  Finish up what you were saying.
[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:34.967]  The second subject I wanted to touch on was the antidepressant drugs that you were speaking on last week because of the shootings and such.
[01:54:35.207 --> 01:54:35.408]  Yes.
[01:54:35.428 --> 01:54:41.453]  The thing that I would like to say that I haven't heard said is, if people just simply knew what all
[01:54:42.165 --> 01:54:44.746]  Drugs that these companies are pushing were made out of.
[01:54:44.887 --> 01:54:50.770]  They're basically byproducts of coal tar and petroleum.
[01:54:50.850 --> 01:55:05.378]  This used to be garbage until the 1930s when the chemical companies started trying to figure out what to do with these different compounds and they literally have the compounds already and they're just testing on people to see what they do.
[01:55:05.418 --> 01:55:09.720]  So these aren't actually drugs that are like, wow, we made this drug and this helps this thing.
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:10.240]  This is
[01:55:11.872 --> 01:55:12.413]  Trash!
[01:55:13.033 --> 01:55:18.757]  And there's a book called The Birth of Heroin and the Demonization of the Dope Fiend by T.H.
[01:55:18.838 --> 01:55:22.661]  Metzger that has the whole history of how, you know, I.G.
[01:55:22.721 --> 01:55:31.768]  Farben and Bayer and how they turned this coal tar trash into our modern pharmaceuticals.
[01:55:31.948 --> 01:55:40.975]  And that's what I think that if people knew that they were giving their kids, you know, this ADHD medicine, it's made out of coal tar extract.
[01:55:41.894 --> 01:55:43.996]  It's chemical and it's disgusting.
[01:55:44.336 --> 01:55:46.198]  And that was the final point that I wanted to make.
[01:55:46.218 --> 01:55:51.062]  It causes brain shrinkage, heart expansion, retardation of growth.
[01:55:51.142 --> 01:55:53.243]  I mean, just go read it for yourself.
[01:55:53.264 --> 01:55:53.924]  Thanks for the call.
[01:55:54.685 --> 01:55:55.085]  I know.
[01:55:55.245 --> 01:55:56.466]  I mean, it's folks.
[01:55:56.506 --> 01:55:58.067]  They come to kill, steal, and destroy.
[01:56:03.352 --> 01:56:04.933]  I'm just speechless a lot of the time now.
[01:56:05.754 --> 01:56:09.297]  Hey, let me tell you about a great sponsor that we're going to end the show and come right back to your calls.
[01:56:10.427 --> 01:56:21.959]  There's a new product alert for people with joint pain, and I'm not going to make medical claims about this, but we check out all our sponsors, and all the ingredients to this are mainline, known to be really good anti-inflammatories and good for arthritis.
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:27.925]  I just want my listeners who are either suffering from arthritis or other joint problems to go to this website, 321relief.com.
[01:56:27.965 --> 01:56:28.406]  321relief.com.
[01:56:31.188 --> 01:56:32.008]  Do your own research.
[01:56:32.469 --> 01:56:42.593]  I want you to be inquisitive and go read about clinical studies and you'll understand why this combination of full spectrum herbs seems to be especially effective for anyone experiencing joint pain.
[01:56:42.773 --> 01:56:44.814]  Folks, this is no ordinary arthritis pill.
[01:56:45.114 --> 01:56:48.595]  It's not something you can buy at the drugstore or even on late night television.
[01:56:48.615 --> 01:56:51.197]  You need to give them a call, ladies and gentlemen, at 877-327-0365.
[01:56:55.496 --> 01:56:59.177]  And it's offer extension A126-877-327-0365 or 321relief.com.
[01:56:59.457 --> 01:57:05.039]  All right, we're going to start the third hour.
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:13.722]  I'm going to talk to Ed, Matt, a few others, and then I am going to get into some other subjects.
[01:57:13.742 --> 01:57:14.882]  But I'm also going to read this story.
[01:57:15.242 --> 01:57:17.903]  New Jersey nears mandated preschool flu shots.
[01:57:19.323 --> 01:57:20.424]  Consensus shattered.
[01:57:21.144 --> 01:57:24.165]  This major scientific study says global warming is natural.
[01:57:25.766 --> 01:57:31.187]  And a lot more coming up in 70 seconds in the third hour of transmission.
[01:57:35.708 --> 01:57:37.808]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:38.328 --> 01:57:41.569]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:42.629]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.656 --> 01:57:52.717]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.437 --> 01:57:54.558]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.198 --> 01:57:56.019]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:57.680]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.700 --> 01:58:01.963]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.523 --> 01:58:06.606]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:22.069 --> 01:58:34.312]  Um, where the studies are on the anti-tobacco injections, I have a friend that took one of these shots, and he, since then, became completely depressed.
[01:58:35.632 --> 01:58:43.674]  And his... Yeah, that's because none of his receptors can receive a large portion of the spectrum of endorphin.
[01:58:45.607 --> 01:58:46.427]  Oh, endorphin.
[01:58:46.527 --> 01:58:50.369]  Okay, I'm writing this down because I promised him I'm going to find the study on it.
[01:58:50.509 --> 01:58:52.910]  Okay, let's... Go ahead.
[01:58:53.930 --> 01:58:58.992]  Well, it's just that he doesn't believe me and he wants to take a second shot because it's free.
[01:59:01.613 --> 01:59:05.254]  Anyway... Well, let me just give you... Go ahead.
[01:59:05.294 --> 01:59:06.914]  Yeah, where can I find that information?
[01:59:06.934 --> 01:59:10.476]  Okay, it's been about a year since I covered it.
[01:59:10.576 --> 01:59:11.396]  You Googled
[01:59:12.495 --> 01:59:13.575]  Let me think back to the headline.
[01:59:13.615 --> 01:59:14.296]  Hold on one moment.
[01:59:14.596 --> 01:59:15.256]  Hold on one moment.
[01:59:16.577 --> 01:59:17.377]  Just keep talking.
[01:59:17.517 --> 01:59:18.558]  I've got to think of the exact headline.
[01:59:18.578 --> 01:59:18.658]  Okay.
[01:59:18.898 --> 01:59:28.241]  Well, another thing is that I'm part of the Ron Paul Meetup group, and we're going to do a video tomorrow at the Eiffel Tower.
[01:59:29.042 --> 01:59:30.642]  So, that's kind of fun.
[01:59:31.383 --> 01:59:36.025]  And then, too, another subject is kind of like a more serious subject.
[01:59:36.105 --> 01:59:39.166]  My in-laws were both in concentration camps.
[01:59:40.232 --> 01:59:51.618]  And something that people just don't realize is that it's just so progressive when, you know, you lose your liberties that, you know, it's just like something they can't see coming.
[01:59:51.958 --> 01:59:52.639]  It's incremental.
[01:59:53.479 --> 01:59:54.660]  Yes, exactly.
[01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:59.342]  Okay, I have gone back into my memory, and I believe this is one of the headlines.
[02:00:00.643 --> 02:00:02.804]  I could try it in Google right now.
[02:00:02.824 --> 02:00:05.786]  In fact, this is just a good exercise for everybody to do.
[02:00:05.826 --> 02:00:07.667]  Let me just pull Google up and check this.
[02:00:08.607 --> 02:00:10.168]  Uh, as I make this announcement.
[02:00:10.769 --> 02:00:32.564]  About three years ago, there was a major PR push in England, and in the continent of Europe, France, Germany, and a smaller push in the United States, with headlines like, new vaccine to treat drug abuse, or new family of vaccines to cure, uh, cigarette smokers.
[02:00:33.325 --> 02:00:36.647]  Uh, and, now it's a new class of vaccines.
[02:00:36.687 --> 02:00:37.367]  Have you heard of HPV?
[02:00:39.210 --> 02:00:39.890]  No, I haven't.
[02:00:40.371 --> 02:00:40.651]  Okay.
[02:00:40.811 --> 02:00:42.952]  That's the human papillomavirus.
[02:00:43.012 --> 02:00:45.394]  It's a live cancer virus injection.
[02:00:46.334 --> 02:00:58.221]  But they've gone in and broken up some of the DNA strands, though it's been killing quite a few people and causing accelerated autoimmune disease and many others, just since it was approved less than a year ago, 11 months ago.
[02:00:58.241 --> 02:01:01.162]  Oh, the shots that they're giving to the, like, the teenage girls?
[02:01:01.222 --> 02:01:04.564]  Yeah, that they claim is the law you have to take in Texas and England, and there's no law in the U.S.
[02:01:04.985 --> 02:01:07.086]  The HPV is a live cancer virus.
[02:01:07.126 --> 02:01:07.266]  Now,
[02:01:08.218 --> 02:01:26.747]  The vaccines that, quote, the majority, there are several classes, but the new ones they're pushing, they, if you read, it says they will cure narcotics and nicotine, because nicotine hits the same receptors as heroin and cocaine.
[02:01:26.827 --> 02:01:32.610]  It actually hits the same receptors that narcotics hit, associated with endorphins.
[02:01:33.317 --> 02:01:36.602]  That's why when you smoke a cigarette, you know, you feel confident and relaxed.
[02:01:36.702 --> 02:01:40.748]  It's like cocaine, but a slightly different effect.
[02:01:40.828 --> 02:01:41.649]  Very, very deadly.
[02:01:41.690 --> 02:01:42.511]  Very, very poisonous.
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:45.741]  And I'm just constantly on and off the stuff.
[02:01:46.202 --> 02:01:48.963]  I've never been into drugs, but nicotine I've got a real problem with.
[02:01:49.043 --> 02:01:52.505]  I started chewing tobacco when I was about 12, and that's the end of the story.
[02:01:52.525 --> 02:01:54.766]  Yeah, it's disgusting, isn't it?
[02:01:55.566 --> 02:01:57.087]  But I'm from Texas, I can't help it.
[02:01:57.107 --> 02:01:59.108]  I'm a redneck.
[02:01:59.628 --> 02:02:06.692]  The point here is that it goes in, it's a live virus, and it's in a cancer family.
[02:02:08.043 --> 02:02:14.424]  And it goes in, oh yeah, and it literally gives you a biological micro-lobotomy.
[02:02:14.784 --> 02:02:16.005]  Viruses are nanotech.
[02:02:16.045 --> 02:02:17.205]  It's God's nanotech.
[02:02:18.185 --> 02:02:19.605]  They say viruses aren't really alive.
[02:02:19.645 --> 02:02:25.147]  They reproduce, but they don't have moving parts and they're not feeding.
[02:02:26.247 --> 02:02:28.827]  They inject data.
[02:02:28.907 --> 02:02:29.267]  Stay there.
[02:02:29.307 --> 02:02:30.408]  This is an important subject.
[02:02:30.768 --> 02:02:32.228]  See, I want to write articles about this.
[02:02:32.268 --> 02:02:33.488]  I want to get scientists on about it.
[02:02:33.508 --> 02:02:34.749]  It's just there's too much.
[02:02:34.789 --> 02:02:36.409]  We're being hit from thousands of sides.
[02:02:37.356 --> 02:02:39.617]  And, uh, I'll tell you about it when we get back.
[02:02:39.657 --> 02:02:42.258]  I said I'd go quickly, but these calls are just too important, every one of them.
[02:02:42.638 --> 02:02:43.959]  Getting a lot of great callers today.
[02:02:43.979 --> 02:02:45.360]  Stay with me.
[02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:47.981]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:49.021 --> 02:02:50.082]  A new world order.
[02:02:50.782 --> 02:02:55.364]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:02:55.684 --> 02:02:58.105]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:02:58.526 --> 02:03:00.767]  Both their objective being world domination.
[02:03:01.307 --> 02:03:03.708]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:04.478 --> 02:03:11.806]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:14.818 --> 02:03:19.801]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:20.282 --> 02:03:23.764]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:24.144 --> 02:03:26.666]  The overburden makes great progress for the world government.
[02:03:26.706 --> 02:03:27.687]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:27.707 --> 02:03:28.607]  They're not after money.
[02:03:28.627 --> 02:03:29.708]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:29.928 --> 02:03:30.669]  They're after power.
[02:03:30.929 --> 02:03:31.949]  That's what I have to do, sir.

[02:04:46.698 --> 02:04:50.479]  As the old saying goes, if you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.
[02:04:50.659 --> 02:04:56.161]  But if you give him a Berkey system, you give him the ability to obtain purified water for a lifetime.
[02:04:56.481 --> 02:05:01.703]  This year, when giving Christmas gifts, instead of unwanted trinkets, give a meaningful and substantial gift.
[02:05:01.883 --> 02:05:06.884]  Berkey systems are ideal for every member of your family, especially the young ones in college.
[02:05:07.104 --> 02:05:10.706]  Unlike other water filtration systems, Berkey purifiers are portable.
[02:05:10.746 --> 02:05:14.987]  They require no plumbing, and the elements don't have to be replaced every four to six months.
[02:05:15.447 --> 02:05:21.870]  Perfect for anyone on a tight budget, and more importantly, if there's an unexpected emergency, your loved ones will be prepared.
[02:05:22.210 --> 02:05:26.031]  That's because Berkey Systems are able to purify raw, untreated water.

[02:05:55.304 --> 02:05:56.144]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.885 --> 02:05:58.806]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.826 --> 02:06:02.408]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.648 --> 02:06:06.751]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.912 --> 02:06:14.976]  I, uh, typed into Google, during that three-minute break, two separate things, vaccine to treat drug use,
[02:06:15.894 --> 02:06:20.817]  And I pulled up something I hadn't even seen yet where they're forcing prisoners to take it.
[02:06:22.999 --> 02:06:26.201]  And it admits that it goes in and quote, changes brain chemistry.
[02:06:26.241 --> 02:06:27.682]  That's a nice way of saying it.
[02:06:28.382 --> 02:06:31.764]  Goes in and eats the receptors and that came out in a report three years ago.
[02:06:31.784 --> 02:06:35.947]  The side effect is that it's causing people to be real unhappy.
[02:06:36.808 --> 02:06:45.073]  To see those drugs mimic natural chemicals, hormones, compounds released by the body.
[02:06:46.457 --> 02:06:56.563]  I mean, let me tell you something, you know, when I get off the stair-stepper and I've just worked out for 30 minutes, I'm totally out of shape, I feel great because there's endorphins to get me through the pain of doing it.
[02:06:57.404 --> 02:07:07.630]  Or when I get off an exercise bike after an hour, after I've bench-pressed 300 pounds, you know, I feel an endorphin rush because it was actually painful to do that and the body is rewarding me for my exertion.
[02:07:09.366 --> 02:07:17.428]  Or right when you break your leg, it hurts right at first, and all of a sudden you kind of feel like you're high, it's still hurting, but it's kind of numb, and you kind of over the pain feel kind of good.
[02:07:20.308 --> 02:07:21.889]  That is endorphins flowing.
[02:07:22.329 --> 02:07:32.931]  Or when you make the touchdown, or you make the big sailing business, or that girl you've had a crush on for six months at work, and you're talking to her at the water cooler, and, hey, let's go out, you probably get the courage to say, hey, let's go out and see a movie.
[02:07:33.507 --> 02:07:35.368]  Go out to dinner and she says, sure, I'd like that Bob.
[02:07:35.388 --> 02:07:38.229]  And you go, oh man, you start feeling really good.
[02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:44.452]  That's your brain going, yes, yes, mate with her, marry her, have children, this is what you're meant to do.
[02:07:45.073 --> 02:07:46.693]  You're designed to do that.
[02:07:48.574 --> 02:07:55.678]  Or when you do things like help an old lady across the street, or give money to Meals on Wheels, or go out and do a soup kitchen, you're meant to help weaker members of the tribe.
[02:07:56.418 --> 02:07:57.458]  You feel good.
[02:07:57.499 --> 02:07:58.939]  It's not some goody-two-shoes thing.
[02:07:59.539 --> 02:08:00.560]  You are meant to do it.
[02:08:02.498 --> 02:08:04.459]  And then I tried Vaccine to Stop Smoking.
[02:08:04.479 --> 02:08:07.962]  29 articles came up in news.
[02:08:08.002 --> 02:08:09.363]  Let's see how many come up on web.
[02:08:09.383 --> 02:08:09.363]  136,000.
[02:08:09.943 --> 02:08:14.767]  Vaccine to Stop Smoking has surprisingly good results!
[02:08:17.609 --> 02:08:20.131]  And then what you do is, don't just read the hype about it.
[02:08:20.571 --> 02:08:27.476]  Go into the drug inserts on the websites of the drug companies selling the anti-cocaine, the anti-heroin, the anti-smoking vaccines.
[02:08:28.670 --> 02:08:33.237]  And go then read how it acts, how it operates.
[02:08:33.998 --> 02:08:42.732]  And the virus goes in and creates plaques at the neuron photoreceptors and the electrochemical exchange
[02:08:45.066 --> 02:08:47.287]  Talk about the cure being worse than the disease.
[02:08:47.967 --> 02:08:49.828]  And yeah, they did in clinical studies in Europe.
[02:08:49.868 --> 02:08:50.988]  Now there's hundreds of these companies.
[02:08:51.048 --> 02:08:52.349]  You can go find different ones than I found.
[02:08:52.889 --> 02:08:54.589]  But I'm finding what I originally found here.
[02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:56.470]  But then I'm finding some other stuff I didn't even know about.
[02:08:56.510 --> 02:08:58.391]  It's always thousands of times worse, folks.
[02:08:58.411 --> 02:08:58.691]  You can't...
[02:08:59.272 --> 02:09:06.017]  They have millions of scientists working around the clock on this type of stuff, and, you know, one of them doesn't know half of what's going on in the industry.
[02:09:06.457 --> 02:09:11.741]  I just... It's always many times more serious, and here they are, forcing prisoners all over the planet to take it.
[02:09:12.281 --> 02:09:13.342]  Oh, you're in here for cocaine.
[02:09:13.382 --> 02:09:14.743]  Here, you won't want it anymore.
[02:09:14.763 --> 02:09:15.683]  Here's an injection.
[02:09:16.024 --> 02:09:17.945]  The viruses will love you now.
[02:09:17.965 --> 02:09:25.090]  Of course, the medical personnel are compartmentalized and think they're doing good at the stupid cop shop.
[02:09:26.812 --> 02:09:28.213]  They'll probably give it to their kids.
[02:09:28.754 --> 02:09:31.597]  And then, when Billy gets depressed, we'll just put him on Prozac.
[02:09:32.918 --> 02:09:37.783]  So, uh, going back to, um... Is it Cheryl in France?
[02:09:38.403 --> 02:09:39.364]  Yeah, it's Cheryl.
[02:09:39.484 --> 02:09:40.485]  Does that answer your question?
[02:09:41.106 --> 02:09:41.827]  It sure does.
[02:09:41.947 --> 02:09:45.971]  It's just, I saw his behavior change drastically.
[02:09:46.511 --> 02:09:46.851]  Oh, yeah?
[02:09:46.911 --> 02:09:48.753]  And, I mean, he's been depressed ever since.
[02:09:49.054 --> 02:09:50.515]  And he wants to go take another one.
[02:09:50.934 --> 02:09:53.695]  I'm going to try to pull these up and really inform him.
[02:09:53.875 --> 02:09:55.056]  How long have you been listening to the show?
[02:09:55.096 --> 02:09:56.256]  Because I said three years ago.
[02:09:56.716 --> 02:09:59.377]  Now there's several different nicotine blockers.
[02:10:00.017 --> 02:10:05.599]  One creates antibodies, they go create plaques, or the viruses actually attack the brain cells themselves.
[02:10:07.060 --> 02:10:08.781]  There may be other ones I'm not aware of.
[02:10:08.821 --> 02:10:09.701]  He needs to check into it.
[02:10:09.881 --> 02:10:11.381]  I mean, do you know the name of the company?
[02:10:12.222 --> 02:10:13.462]  No, I don't know anything.
[02:10:13.682 --> 02:10:14.363]  I really don't.
[02:10:14.563 --> 02:10:15.483]  So is this your boyfriend?
[02:10:16.317 --> 02:10:20.598]  Well, it wasn't my boyfriend until he started taking, he took that one shot.
[02:10:21.038 --> 02:10:22.259]  Oh, tell me about what happened.
[02:10:23.159 --> 02:10:25.159]  Oh my God, I can't go through it.
[02:10:25.199 --> 02:10:26.280]  It was so painful.
[02:10:26.300 --> 02:10:32.221]  He just, he couldn't, he just was dissatisfied with everything and everyone.
[02:10:32.241 --> 02:10:35.702]  So he wasn't even excited about you anymore, was he?
[02:10:36.062 --> 02:10:36.983]  No, no.
[02:10:37.103 --> 02:10:37.743]  Well, you know why?
[02:10:37.763 --> 02:10:45.525]  Because it's a hormonal process in the brain, generally triggered by the olfactory nerve, you know, the nose.
[02:10:46.836 --> 02:10:49.858]  And, uh, he just, your smell doesn't, um, yeah.
[02:10:51.159 --> 02:10:58.484]  Yeah, so, anyway, that, it's like, I'm being very nice because I'm trying to find this information so he won't take another shot.
[02:10:58.664 --> 02:11:01.967]  But, I mean, you know, it was really pretty bad.
[02:11:02.007 --> 02:11:03.588]  Sounds like the shot did its job.
[02:11:04.368 --> 02:11:05.309]  Oh, it really did.
[02:11:05.549 --> 02:11:09.592]  So he's thinking, uh, he's, yeah, he's thinking, uh, that another one will help him.
[02:11:10.793 --> 02:11:13.535]  And now he's thinking, yeah, like another shot is gonna help him.
[02:11:14.306 --> 02:11:18.570]  And I've told him, you know, no, stop, I'll find the studies, don't take it.
[02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:20.792]  But see, you hadn't even heard me say it, did this.
[02:11:20.812 --> 02:11:22.393]  You just called in and said he's now in the press.
[02:11:23.574 --> 02:11:29.519]  Um, what I heard, I heard you talk about this about six months ago, maybe, or a little more.
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:33.662]  And I kind of thought, oh my God, he took one of those shots.
[02:11:34.783 --> 02:11:37.906]  And, and then I started thinking, but that's what it is.
[02:11:38.066 --> 02:11:38.907]  That's what it is.
[02:11:39.741 --> 02:11:42.223]  You know, it's like it hit me after I heard you say that.
[02:11:42.243 --> 02:11:44.464]  It was exactly what was happening.
[02:11:44.664 --> 02:11:47.406]  He was dissatisfied with me, with everything.
[02:11:47.426 --> 02:11:51.889]  And it was hearing you talk about it that I put two and two together.
[02:11:52.529 --> 02:11:57.813]  Yeah, that's kind of like saying you've got a problem looking at pornography, so we're going to poke your eyes out.
[02:11:58.653 --> 02:12:00.754]  You say, oh, you've got a problem with this drug.
[02:12:01.215 --> 02:12:06.118]  Well, that drug has an effect with those brain cells because those brain cells are there for a reason.
[02:12:06.138 --> 02:12:09.360]  And they're there to like Cheryl.
[02:12:10.299 --> 02:12:13.601]  See, those brain cells are there to like doing well in business.
[02:12:14.702 --> 02:12:16.703]  You see, it's your drive.
[02:12:18.264 --> 02:12:22.647]  Well, yeah, it's kind of like anybody who's... Yeah, I can see that now.
[02:12:23.328 --> 02:12:25.089]  But I think... Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:12:25.149 --> 02:12:26.490]  I'm going to try to look these up.
[02:12:27.262 --> 02:12:30.705]  Um, because I'd really like to find something that shows them how dangerous it is.
[02:12:31.085 --> 02:12:31.966]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:12:32.567 --> 02:12:39.773]  Well, you know, they put it all in nice words like it causes a neurological alteration in the structure of the brain tissue.
[02:12:41.114 --> 02:12:42.755]  Does he realize what that means?
[02:12:44.136 --> 02:12:45.297]  Well, I hope he will.
[02:12:46.318 --> 02:12:48.280]  That means his brain is being altered.
[02:12:49.321 --> 02:12:49.621]  Yeah.
[02:12:50.722 --> 02:12:53.284]  And see, listen, I'm really sorry, Cheryl.
[02:12:54.025 --> 02:12:54.245]  Okay.
[02:12:54.981 --> 02:13:00.746]  I'm really sorry, but tell him to seek his own medical research because I don't know which one of the... I don't know how many others are.
[02:13:00.766 --> 02:13:03.449]  It looks like there's like 20 of them I've just looked at here in five minutes.
[02:13:04.110 --> 02:13:05.291]  It's all these different ones.
[02:13:08.654 --> 02:13:09.855]  Smoking vaccine.
[02:13:10.195 --> 02:13:10.836]  Heaven help us.
[02:13:11.857 --> 02:13:13.058]  Quit smoking vaccination.
[02:13:13.098 --> 02:13:13.879]  It's not a dream anymore.
[02:13:14.559 --> 02:13:16.901]  Quit smoking vaccine is turning out to be a good option.
[02:13:18.743 --> 02:13:19.444]  Stop smoking.
[02:13:20.715 --> 02:13:29.181]  Anti-Smoking Vaccination, Stop Smoking Vaccine, Experimental Nicotine Quit Smoke Vaccine, Vaccine to Stop Smoking has surprisingly good results!
[02:13:30.222 --> 02:13:33.224]  Vaccine to Stop Smoking effective in Phase 2 Trials!
[02:13:36.786 --> 02:13:50.076]  Isito Biotechnology AG announced that its vaccine candidate, CYT002, NICQB, to treat nicotine addiction, has achieved proof of efficiency and efficacy.
[02:13:54.659 --> 02:13:56.119]  Where was that one I was on earlier?
[02:13:56.139 --> 02:13:58.660]  I actually found a scholarly white paper.
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:02.061]  Where's the one I was on here?
[02:14:02.121 --> 02:14:02.861]  Hold on, folks.
[02:14:02.901 --> 02:14:03.301]  Here it is.
[02:14:05.321 --> 02:14:05.481]  Ah, man.
[02:14:05.541 --> 02:14:08.182]  There's too many hundreds of these I was just looking at during the break.
[02:14:10.262 --> 02:14:11.963]  See, that's why I don't allow a computer in here.
[02:14:12.003 --> 02:14:12.523]  Now I've done it.
[02:14:12.563 --> 02:14:16.064]  I just end up surfing around on air while everybody just sits around listening to me babble.
[02:14:17.604 --> 02:14:18.064]  Here it is.
[02:14:18.944 --> 02:14:19.324]  Here it is.
[02:14:19.404 --> 02:14:21.825]  New Generation Vaccines is the name of the book.
[02:14:22.847 --> 02:14:34.331]  It's a textbook updated to reflect the wide spectrum of economic, regulatory, financial, ethical, and political issues impacting vaccinology and industrialized and developing nations.
[02:14:34.351 --> 02:14:37.372]  The third edition pinpoints relative breakthroughs.
[02:14:38.312 --> 02:14:39.573]  Mechanisms of action.
[02:14:40.153 --> 02:14:41.053]  It's a tiny print.
[02:14:41.093 --> 02:14:41.874]  Let me hold this up here.
[02:14:42.554 --> 02:14:49.096]  The vaccines discussed below are producing antibodies that bind drugs and alter their tissue distribution.
[02:14:52.049 --> 02:15:09.204]  Or elimination, both active immunization of the animals being studied, herein referred to as vaccination, and passive immunization administered of exogenously produced antibodies have been studied and will be discussed.
[02:15:09.984 --> 02:15:17.871]  An alternative approach involved generation of catalytic antibodies that act by enhancing drug
[02:15:19.207 --> 02:15:24.452]  Metabolic rate have also been applied to cocaine and will be considered separately.
[02:15:26.493 --> 02:15:30.577]  Relationship between addiction and drug concentration in brain.
[02:15:31.658 --> 02:15:34.120]  Cisco, I'm just, that's the top page, you can imagine.
[02:15:36.822 --> 02:15:37.883]  And see, that sounds real nice.
[02:15:37.903 --> 02:15:39.144]  Oh, it makes an antibody.
[02:15:39.184 --> 02:15:42.888]  Yes, and then those antibodies go and create plaques.
[02:15:44.944 --> 02:15:48.665]  It causes an autoimmune response and creates plaques burning out the receptors.
[02:15:48.685 --> 02:15:50.366]  I mean, I've read that in these reports.
[02:15:50.386 --> 02:15:53.827]  I don't know about this particular vaccine, that was just one of them.
[02:15:56.128 --> 02:15:58.168]  Ed in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:16:00.449 --> 02:16:03.610]  Yeah, type in tobacco, vaccines, and the word danger.
[02:16:04.670 --> 02:16:13.053]  And any time you're looking up, Googling something, and you have a question, type in the word danger next to it and you'll get the... You did that, tobacco, tobacco, keep talking, tobacco.
[02:16:13.635 --> 02:16:18.259]  Yeah, I watched it when you sent it, or maybe somebody else did.
[02:16:18.279 --> 02:16:20.681]  When did you send it?
[02:16:33.749 --> 02:16:34.809]  Oh, about three or four years ago.
[02:16:34.990 --> 02:16:35.670]  Yeah, I watched it.
[02:16:36.130 --> 02:16:37.110]  Yeah, I've never seen the whole thing.
[02:16:37.130 --> 02:16:38.111]  That's with Charlton Heston.
[02:16:38.151 --> 02:16:38.991]  It's coming back out.
[02:16:39.771 --> 02:16:41.572]  And Reuters was very upset with the movie.
[02:16:41.612 --> 02:16:43.413]  It said it creates fear of vaccines.
[02:16:43.433 --> 02:16:44.613]  I didn't cover that last week.
[02:16:44.953 --> 02:16:49.395]  The government creates an anti-cancer vaccine that kills 99% of people.
[02:16:50.435 --> 02:16:54.897]  Yeah, in that movie, it's all, like, vaccine, vaccine to save your life and stuff.
[02:16:55.017 --> 02:17:00.899]  And Neville, who will be Will Smith, he works for the government, for the military.
[02:17:00.959 --> 02:17:03.020]  He's a microbiologist and, you know,
[02:17:04.088 --> 02:17:07.912]  And I guess Arnold Schwarzenegger was supposed to play it, but it fell through for him.
[02:17:08.673 --> 02:17:10.976]  Yeah, he's a washed up Nazi piece of trash.
[02:17:11.517 --> 02:17:16.182]  Yes, and another thing Alex, you stick to your promise and you spend more time with your family.
[02:17:17.003 --> 02:17:21.568]  You promised that like two weeks ago and that's, you know, I know you're fighting for us 100%, but...
[02:17:22.950 --> 02:17:23.951]  You enjoy your family, Alex.
[02:17:24.171 --> 02:17:27.655]  I mean, it's just, you read about the carnage they're carrying out, I just get mad, okay?
[02:17:27.675 --> 02:17:29.937]  I'm just not yelling and screaming, I just sound nasty and mean.
[02:17:30.538 --> 02:17:32.520]  And I apologize for that, I'm just sick of it all.
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:33.461]  Thanks for the call, my friend.
[02:17:34.021 --> 02:17:37.725]  Matt, Rick, many, many others.
[02:17:39.447 --> 02:17:40.768]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[02:17:40.788 --> 02:17:42.089]  Continue with your phone calls.
[02:17:43.130 --> 02:17:43.531]  Stay with us.
[02:17:46.631 --> 02:17:48.013]  Ted Anders from Midas, December 11, 2007.

[02:17:50.916 --> 02:17:51.337]  That's $828.95, $408.55, and $204.28.
[02:17:59.804 --> 02:18:05.908]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[02:18:05.968 --> 02:18:10.371]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan Revolution.
[02:18:10.691 --> 02:18:19.337]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[02:18:19.377 --> 02:18:21.999]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[02:18:22.299 --> 02:18:26.263]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[02:18:26.483 --> 02:18:33.050]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[02:18:33.370 --> 02:18:34.531]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.

[02:18:46.102 --> 02:18:51.186]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:18:51.266 --> 02:18:58.572]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:18:58.712 --> 02:19:09.360]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:14.084]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:19:14.364 --> 02:19:19.371]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[02:19:19.571 --> 02:19:22.515]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:22.755 --> 02:19:32.568]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:19:47.886 --> 02:19:49.587]  A two-way radio may be for you.
[02:19:49.767 --> 02:19:53.789]  Two-way radios provide short-range communication with no recurring service charges.
[02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:57.051]  Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and skiing.
[02:19:57.211 --> 02:20:01.034]  Great for amusement parks, cruises, or just keeping up with the kids around the neighborhood.
[02:20:01.194 --> 02:20:03.575]  Two-way radios can also make your business more efficient.

[02:20:36.169 --> 02:20:39.092]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:20:39.292 --> 02:20:45.878]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:20:45.918 --> 02:20:48.220]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate.
[02:20:57.088 --> 02:20:58.568]  And others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:20:58.869 --> 02:21:07.791]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[02:21:11.912 --> 02:21:16.934]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:21:17.234 --> 02:21:23.936]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[02:21:52.433 --> 02:22:18.002]  I read the news today, oh boy About a lucky man who made the grade And though the news was rather sad Well, I just had to laugh I saw the photograph
[02:22:29.701 --> 02:22:34.067]  He didn't notice that the lights had changed.
[02:22:35.449 --> 02:22:39.895]  A crowd of people stood and stared.
[02:22:41.898 --> 02:22:44.502]  They'd seen his face before.
[02:22:44.622 --> 02:22:46.825]  Nobody was really sure if he was from Ohio.
[02:23:01.178 --> 02:23:03.619]  Okay, next is Matt in Chicago.
[02:23:03.639 --> 02:23:06.620]  Thanks for holding patiently, Matt.
[02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:11.342]  Hey, Mr. Jones, I'm having a cigarette right now, and maybe they can issue me a quit-smoking handgun.
[02:23:11.362 --> 02:23:13.383]  Don't smoke too many cigarettes after that.
[02:23:13.403 --> 02:23:19.486]  But anyway, I was listening to a certain radio talk show host late night, and he was mentioning about autism.
[02:23:19.526 --> 02:23:25.548]  He said that he was trying to make the point that autism wasn't really that bad, and it was really kind of disturbing to listen to him say that.
[02:23:26.408 --> 02:23:27.689]  And he was saying things like,
[02:23:28.750 --> 02:23:33.875]  Oh, well, maybe it's dolphin genes that are inside of them and, you know, autism isn't bad.
[02:23:33.935 --> 02:23:42.063]  He's basically making the point that all these autistic, these poor autistic kids are like some sort of super genius and it's just ridiculous how much disinformation is out there.
[02:23:43.424 --> 02:23:44.445]  Well, that's too bad.
[02:23:44.505 --> 02:23:47.789]  We know that it's tied to mercury, the number one thing.
[02:23:48.636 --> 02:23:57.320]  Uh, but it's also tied to virus contamination, injected into the blood-brain barrier, getting into the bloodstream into the brain directly.
[02:23:57.340 --> 02:24:01.822]  There's a whole cornucopia of things doing this, and it's just documented.
[02:24:01.842 --> 02:24:03.322]  Oh, yeah.
[02:24:04.083 --> 02:24:05.083]  Yeah, I believe you.
[02:24:05.123 --> 02:24:06.164]  I believe you completely.
[02:24:06.204 --> 02:24:06.964]  I'm just mentioning.
[02:24:07.304 --> 02:24:08.245]  Oh, and check this out.
[02:24:08.285 --> 02:24:09.285]  I'm in a parking lot right now.
[02:24:09.945 --> 02:24:12.766]  Why do I have to work an insane job?
[02:24:16.052 --> 02:24:17.696]  So that's just my little sign up for you.
[02:24:18.057 --> 02:24:19.180]  Good job, my friend.
[02:24:20.303 --> 02:24:21.586]  What else is on your mind, Matt?
[02:24:22.489 --> 02:24:22.769]  Nothing.
[02:24:22.809 --> 02:24:24.313]  I just called in today because I'm angry.
[02:24:25.100 --> 02:24:27.963]  Uh, you know, I can understand exactly what you're feeling when you say you're angry.
[02:24:28.323 --> 02:24:29.905]  I'm angry all the time about this stuff.
[02:24:29.925 --> 02:24:31.306]  I don't know what to do except tell people.
[02:24:31.366 --> 02:24:39.173]  I mean, I would never think about murdering some child with an AIDS injection or with some shot that's gonna rot their guts out, and they know they're doing it.
[02:24:39.533 --> 02:24:42.656]  They got all these idiots that refuse to look at the facts that are administering it.
[02:24:43.077 --> 02:24:46.800]  We got liars running around saying it's the law, you gotta take all this when there's no law.
[02:24:47.140 --> 02:24:47.661]  I'm just...
[02:24:48.419 --> 02:24:50.241]  I mean, we just need to get mad, folks.
[02:24:50.661 --> 02:24:51.842]  It's time to get angry.
[02:24:52.323 --> 02:24:54.004]  And where would we be without you?
[02:24:54.065 --> 02:24:55.086]  I mean, you're just incredible.
[02:24:55.106 --> 02:24:56.847]  I listen to your radio show all the time.
[02:24:57.148 --> 02:24:58.209]  I am not incredible!
[02:24:58.529 --> 02:25:03.013]  I read BBC and London Guardian and everybody else saying, oh, how wonderful!
[02:25:03.313 --> 02:25:06.877]  Live virus vaccines that eat holes in your brain.
[02:25:06.897 --> 02:25:13.003]  They said it in a nice way, but it says it goes in and creates plaques in the receptors so you can't use drugs anymore.
[02:25:13.849 --> 02:25:22.131]  And then I read deeper, and I went and read medical studies on it, and it said, oh, but the problem is, is you tend to be depressed because those are the same receptors that your natural endorphins hit.
[02:25:22.691 --> 02:25:23.611]  I'm not smart.
[02:25:23.811 --> 02:25:25.091]  That's not hard to know.
[02:25:25.111 --> 02:25:28.732]  That's basic brain metabolic system.
[02:25:30.433 --> 02:25:31.813]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:25:31.833 --> 02:25:37.374]  I mean, my gosh, folks, again, it's like if you had a problem looking at pornography.
[02:25:38.220 --> 02:25:42.364]  And you had a porn addiction, and so you gouged your eyes out to stop doing it.
[02:25:42.664 --> 02:25:43.986]  That's exactly what this is.
[02:25:44.266 --> 02:25:58.519]  Oh, I've got a problem with drugs, with heroin and cocaine and cigarettes, and they admitted one shot can cover all of them, one vaccine that's out there, so I'll just take a drug that sends viruses into my brain to have autoimmune interactions and create plaques.
[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:01.262]  It's literal lobotomies!
[02:26:03.467 --> 02:26:03.787]  I know.
[02:26:04.067 --> 02:26:05.368]  Like you said, I'm speechless.
[02:26:05.768 --> 02:26:09.230]  I don't even know what to say about this stuff anymore, because you tell people and they don't listen.
[02:26:09.270 --> 02:26:15.773]  I mean, there's got to be some way of talking to someone in such a way that they'll listen to this stuff.
[02:26:15.873 --> 02:26:20.656]  And, you know, I don't know, maybe I'll write something, write a book about it, or make a website.
[02:26:20.696 --> 02:26:25.598]  But I was thinking, what if I made a website where people could go out into the streets and just start telling people?
[02:26:25.838 --> 02:26:28.580]  You know, you videotape yourself talking to people about this stuff.
[02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:34.605]  Put the video on YouTube and then you have a forum where you can go and people can post their links and like, oh, this is what I did this week.
[02:26:34.646 --> 02:26:40.371]  Well, you know, I've had for two years, I wanted to start a MySpace video upload, video up, audio upload system.
[02:26:40.411 --> 02:26:41.652]  And that's all happening now.
[02:26:41.692 --> 02:26:42.673]  We've actually hired the people.
[02:26:42.713 --> 02:26:43.514]  It's all moving forward.
[02:26:43.534 --> 02:26:44.175]  It's all going well.
[02:26:44.555 --> 02:26:47.938]  Most of it's held up because I don't have time to give people direction.
[02:26:48.819 --> 02:26:50.721]  But I'm cracking the whip to do that.
[02:26:50.961 --> 02:26:52.342]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:26:52.963 --> 02:26:54.084]  And I understand your anger.
[02:26:58.789 --> 02:27:01.251]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, it's up to you.
[02:27:01.351 --> 02:27:06.015]  If you want to bring these criminals to justice, A. Do not believe anything I've said.
[02:27:06.055 --> 02:27:06.875]  Go check it out.
[02:27:07.376 --> 02:27:10.238]  Learn it's true so you have the actual material.

[02:27:15.662 --> 02:27:16.563]  Then get informed.
[02:27:17.124 --> 02:27:17.884]  Pick an issue.
[02:27:19.265 --> 02:27:20.786]  And then go out and educate others.
[02:27:22.588 --> 02:27:25.250]  News Blitz coming up after this break and then more of your calls.
[02:27:25.270 --> 02:27:27.672]  But I got some good news, some bad news, and some ugly news.
[02:27:29.537 --> 02:27:33.100]  Coming up right now after this break.
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:34.421]  Stand by.
[02:27:36.462 --> 02:27:37.383]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.863 --> 02:27:39.464]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.405 --> 02:27:43.107]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.155 --> 02:27:46.815]  It's a fact.
[02:27:47.036 --> 02:27:54.500]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:28:03.466]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[02:28:03.766 --> 02:28:14.333]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:28:14.573 --> 02:28:20.577]  We can terminate your unsecure debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[02:28:20.837 --> 02:28:25.858]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[02:28:26.058 --> 02:28:30.539]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.

[02:28:46.361 --> 02:28:48.203]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:28:48.343 --> 02:28:53.547]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:28:53.687 --> 02:28:55.049]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:28:55.309 --> 02:29:03.476]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:29:13.564 --> 02:29:13.904]  I think so.
[02:29:28.561 --> 02:29:28.961]  We're good.
[02:29:47.569 --> 02:29:53.013]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:29:53.434 --> 02:29:58.157]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:29:58.558 --> 02:30:01.160]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:30:01.680 --> 02:30:05.103]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:30:05.863 --> 02:30:10.186]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:30:10.627 --> 02:30:13.829]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:30:14.430 --> 02:30:17.252]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?

[02:30:25.075 --> 02:30:25.616]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[02:30:25.696 --> 02:30:26.416]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:30:26.436 --> 02:30:27.256]  Ask for George.
[02:30:46.403 --> 02:30:47.844]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[02:30:48.324 --> 02:30:49.464]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[02:30:50.085 --> 02:30:50.845]  It's a depression.
[02:30:52.025 --> 02:30:54.987]  Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job.
[02:30:56.327 --> 02:30:57.868]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[02:30:58.328 --> 02:30:59.369]  Banks are going bust.
[02:30:59.429 --> 02:31:01.349]  Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
[02:31:01.990 --> 02:31:03.570]  Punks are running wild in the street.
[02:31:03.610 --> 02:31:06.192]  There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[02:31:07.812 --> 02:31:10.193]  We know the air is unfit to breathe.
[02:31:10.333 --> 02:31:11.734]  Our food is unfit to eat.
[02:31:12.518 --> 02:31:21.064]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
[02:31:21.324 --> 02:31:23.385]  We know things are bad, worse than bad.
[02:31:23.986 --> 02:31:24.706]  They're crazy.
[02:31:24.926 --> 02:31:27.948]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[02:31:28.329 --> 02:31:35.253]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[02:31:35.293 --> 02:31:39.656]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radios and I won't say anything.
[02:31:39.856 --> 02:31:40.677]  Just leave us alone.
[02:31:40.917 --> 02:31:42.258]  Well, I'm not going to leave you alone.
[02:31:43.138 --> 02:31:44.299]  I want you to get mad!
[02:31:44.319 --> 02:31:46.399]  I don't want you to protest.
[02:31:46.499 --> 02:31:47.539]  I don't want you to riot.
[02:31:47.559 --> 02:31:50.500]  I don't want you to write to your congressmen because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[02:31:50.880 --> 02:31:55.182]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the streets.
[02:31:55.482 --> 02:31:58.042]  All I know is that first, you've got to get mad!
[02:31:58.482 --> 02:32:00.383]  You've got to say, I'm a human being!
[02:32:00.623 --> 02:32:01.843]  My life has value!
[02:32:03.444 --> 02:32:03.864]  I want you...
[02:32:04.787 --> 02:32:06.068]  To get up now.
[02:32:06.888 --> 02:32:08.970]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[02:32:10.271 --> 02:32:20.678]  I want you to get up right now, and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'M TIRED OF HELL AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
[02:32:21.878 --> 02:32:23.319]  I want you to get up right now.
[02:32:24.020 --> 02:32:28.403]  Get up, go to your windows, open them and stick your head out and yell,
[02:32:30.900 --> 02:32:34.462]  I'm as tired as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[02:32:42.505 --> 02:32:46.687]  I'm as tired as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[02:32:50.649 --> 02:32:54.150]  A bunch of psychopathic control freaks are in control of our society.
[02:32:54.210 --> 02:32:59.933]  And what I'm trying to say to you today is this.
[02:33:02.473 --> 02:33:12.017]  We have to stop taking all the things that are happening just intellectually, and just sit back and learn more.
[02:33:12.097 --> 02:33:12.757]  That's part of it.
[02:33:13.937 --> 02:33:31.344]  We have to realize that things as serious as are happening today all around us, just what we know is off the charts insane bad, we have to realize the normal response is to be out in the streets, is to be talking to our neighbors, is to change our lives,
[02:33:32.168 --> 02:33:33.809]  And make this the central area.
[02:33:34.889 --> 02:33:50.735]  A bunch of mad scientists with a bunch of inbred European elites who are totally into exterminating populations, running wild, lying to us, running every form of scam you can imagine, financial, military, medical.
[02:33:53.195 --> 02:33:55.916]  I mean, we're dealing with a literal hell spawn.
[02:33:59.258 --> 02:34:00.318]  And we have to face some
[02:34:02.159 --> 02:34:06.281]  We can't just go back to our houses and watch our sitcoms and laugh and think everything's okay.
[02:34:06.982 --> 02:34:08.222]  We have to stand up.
[02:34:08.302 --> 02:34:10.083]  I'm telling you, I can't do all this alone.
[02:34:10.283 --> 02:34:11.084]  People say, oh, thank you.
[02:34:11.124 --> 02:34:12.184]  I'm glad somebody's doing something.
[02:34:12.224 --> 02:34:13.325]  I'm glad somebody's out there.
[02:34:16.367 --> 02:34:17.967]  It's an old cliché, but it's true.
[02:34:18.568 --> 02:34:23.050]  You know, just 1% of what I'm saying is true, and unfortunately, folks, it's always worse than I know.
[02:34:23.110 --> 02:34:24.651]  Because there's always more I learn.
[02:34:24.851 --> 02:34:26.132]  There's always more I discover.
[02:34:26.172 --> 02:34:27.252]  It's in their words!
[02:34:27.372 --> 02:34:29.273]  It's them saying it!
[02:34:29.333 --> 02:34:30.554]  They've confessed!
[02:34:31.539 --> 02:34:32.760]  They've admitted it!
[02:34:38.005 --> 02:34:46.012]  I mean, how could anyone in their right mind, and they're lining up by the tens of thousands in trials the last three years in the U.S.
[02:34:46.072 --> 02:34:46.453]  and England.
[02:34:47.193 --> 02:34:53.099]  The first time I ever heard of this three, four years ago, I guess about four years ago now, it was all over British papers in a PR rollout.
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:55.261]  Been always telling it's a rollout.
[02:34:56.932 --> 02:34:58.453]  And they all just roll it out there.
[02:34:58.854 --> 02:34:59.594]  Oh, it's wonderful!
[02:34:59.634 --> 02:35:04.438]  Cocaine abuse, heroin abuse, nicotine abuse, marijuana abuse.
[02:35:04.839 --> 02:35:07.181]  Everything will soon be cured with the vaccines.
[02:35:07.641 --> 02:35:08.542]  Oh, it's so simple.
[02:35:08.782 --> 02:35:10.643]  The trials show it's working wonderfully.
[02:35:10.663 --> 02:35:11.644]  Oh, it's so good.
[02:35:12.325 --> 02:35:18.350]  What do you think a vaccine with a live virus is going to do going into your brain?
[02:35:18.370 --> 02:35:23.314]  I mean, it was bound to cause problems.
[02:35:23.354 --> 02:35:24.555]  And then they admit, oh, well,
[02:35:26.184 --> 02:35:29.886]  These are the receptors that are for your natural feel-good juice.
[02:35:29.906 --> 02:35:37.791]  You know, there's hundreds of these different endorphins.
[02:35:37.811 --> 02:35:44.074]  They all hit different things and they're just going to go in and create plaques in your brain for whole classes of these things.
[02:35:47.396 --> 02:35:51.599]  And then people take these and the statistics come out, oh yeah, they're lazy slobs now.
[02:35:53.419 --> 02:35:56.221]  They don't have any... I mean, they're like zombies!
[02:35:58.183 --> 02:36:00.485]  It's kind of like in that Disney movie, The Black Hole.
[02:36:02.747 --> 02:36:15.118]  Where, you know, they're out there on that research ship and they've taken the crew who didn't want to go along and just... and just... given them an electrical lobotomy so they're just slobbering zombies that just stumble around doing their menial task.
[02:36:19.261 --> 02:36:20.022]  I mean, we've got...
[02:36:21.042 --> 02:36:25.823]  UN documents and the founder of UNESCO saying they wanted to do this exact type bull to us.
[02:36:26.144 --> 02:36:27.764]  Why do you think it's in so many movies?
[02:36:28.624 --> 02:36:34.246]  Why do you think at the end of that Leonard Cohen song he talks about these exact type things?
[02:36:34.266 --> 02:36:35.526]  Just everybody knows.
[02:36:36.126 --> 02:36:41.368]  Anybody who's intellectual, anybody who's in intellectual circles either is for this stuff or against it.
[02:36:41.388 --> 02:36:44.709]  I mean I was on my Myspace yesterday and there was the article written by Steve
[02:36:45.643 --> 02:36:56.552]  About one-child policies they're trying to push in the Western world now, announcing, as I told you they would, I mean, six months ago I saw a huge PR rollout, and I said, okay, you're gonna hear government and medical institutions come in next.
[02:36:56.692 --> 02:36:59.094]  Sure enough, I mean, it's the same, they got a formula!
[02:37:00.255 --> 02:37:04.358]  I gotta watch them, I know the plays they're gonna call, I know what they're gonna do, I know how they're gonna do it.
[02:37:11.616 --> 02:37:17.820]  I mean, you don't think the male sperm count in Europe is down by 87% or 85% in the U.S.
[02:37:18.060 --> 02:37:22.743]  because Mary Poppins flew over everybody's house and put some pixie dust on us, do you?
[02:37:26.905 --> 02:37:28.306]  And they'll say, oh, that's the environment.
[02:37:28.326 --> 02:37:29.607]  That's causal effects.
[02:37:29.627 --> 02:37:30.688]  That's, you know, that's other things.
[02:37:30.928 --> 02:37:32.309]  Yeah, that's part of the cocktail.
[02:37:32.349 --> 02:37:35.471]  You know, I was on BBC Radio Saturday night.
[02:37:39.873 --> 02:37:40.694]  I was on BBC.
[02:37:42.458 --> 02:37:43.979]  With a continent-wide program.
[02:37:48.420 --> 02:37:50.581]  They take excerpts of it and put it on World Service.
[02:37:50.601 --> 02:37:53.682]  I don't know if my talk got out globally.
[02:37:54.883 --> 02:37:56.623]  They had me set up for 25 minutes.
[02:37:58.224 --> 02:37:59.384]  Guess how long they had me on?
[02:37:59.524 --> 02:38:00.044]  Four minutes.
[02:38:00.165 --> 02:38:01.545]  I had an atomic clock in front of me.
[02:38:05.547 --> 02:38:06.347]  And I'm sitting there.
[02:38:08.808 --> 02:38:12.109]  And I hear them talking about everybody around them's got cancer right before I come on.
[02:38:13.248 --> 02:38:16.412]  And I come on and I say, well, you know, there's cancer viruses in any of the vaccines.
[02:38:16.432 --> 02:38:18.073]  He goes, you can't prove that.
[02:38:18.093 --> 02:38:18.714]  That's made up.
[02:38:18.754 --> 02:38:21.377]  And I said, SB40, the polio vaccine, it's still in it.
[02:38:21.778 --> 02:38:22.258]  He shut up.
[02:38:22.799 --> 02:38:23.660]  Somebody pops in.
[02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:24.420]  They cut me off air.
[02:38:24.461 --> 02:38:25.101]  It was a producer's voice.
[02:38:25.121 --> 02:38:26.022]  He goes, you can't talk about that.
[02:38:26.042 --> 02:38:26.663]  You can't say that.
[02:38:27.864 --> 02:38:31.388]  They put me back on and I go, well, you just, you just asked me for proof here.
[02:38:31.408 --> 02:38:32.129]  Let me give you proof.
[02:38:32.209 --> 02:38:33.130]  No, no, no.
[02:38:33.190 --> 02:38:33.791]  You can't do that.
[02:38:36.337 --> 02:38:40.740]  And he said, no, cancer is way up because of environmental things and lifestyle.
[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:49.424]  And yeah, you drink a bottle of Jack Daniels every day and you smoke cigarettes, you're going to die of liver disease, you're going to get lung cancer if the vaccines don't get you first.
[02:38:51.225 --> 02:39:01.011]  But I remember seeing the statistics in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s in England with the coal miners and the people in the big smelting plants with toxic waste and everything else you can imagine.
[02:39:01.211 --> 02:39:02.892]  They had much lower levels of cancer.
[02:39:04.019 --> 02:39:09.862]  In the 20s, in the United States and in England, 1 in 33 died of cancer.
[02:39:09.922 --> 02:39:10.822]  It's now 1 in 3.
[02:39:14.184 --> 02:39:15.304]  You understand that, Jack?
[02:39:16.305 --> 02:39:20.046]  I'm going to say that real slow for everybody out there listening.
[02:39:20.927 --> 02:39:22.467]  I'm going to say that real slow.
[02:39:24.128 --> 02:39:24.508]  Okay?
[02:39:25.849 --> 02:39:26.789]  For new listeners.
[02:39:27.770 --> 02:39:32.232]  In the 1920s, in federally collated numbers, and it's the same out of England,
[02:39:33.522 --> 02:39:38.305]  Some numbers are as high as 1 out of 45, but let's just go with the conservative numbers.
[02:39:38.325 --> 02:39:41.027]  1 in 33 people died of cancer.
[02:39:41.047 --> 02:39:42.068]  1 in 3 die today from it.
[02:39:42.468 --> 02:39:42.848]  Now,
[02:39:57.017 --> 02:39:57.797]  Here's another example.
[02:39:57.837 --> 02:40:02.500]  I saw a report last year that in the last decade, in fact, don't believe me here, I'll just Google it right now.
[02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:03.040]  How's that sound?
[02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:04.301]  How's that sound right now?
[02:40:04.441 --> 02:40:06.001]  Here, I'll just do it right now.
[02:40:07.582 --> 02:40:11.524]  That women's lung cancer has gone up six times.
[02:40:11.564 --> 02:40:12.244]  That was in 2005, actually.
[02:40:12.264 --> 02:40:14.585]  From 1995 to 2005, women's lung cancer went up six-fold.
[02:40:24.585 --> 02:40:27.186]  And do you know what the Feds added that wasn't part of the study?
[02:40:27.206 --> 02:40:28.306]  The study was just scientific.
[02:40:30.886 --> 02:40:31.686]  Just off their data.
[02:40:32.767 --> 02:40:34.067]  They added the spin.
[02:40:35.467 --> 02:40:37.128]  They said, oh, it's secondhand smoke.
[02:40:37.548 --> 02:40:38.808]  But then I went and looked at the numbers.
[02:40:39.248 --> 02:40:41.969]  Smoking's weighed down since the 80s.
[02:40:44.009 --> 02:40:45.929]  These are young women, a lot of them, getting it.
[02:40:46.409 --> 02:40:47.810]  These are women who never smoked.
[02:40:47.870 --> 02:40:50.310]  And so they go, well, that's because it's secondhand smoke.
[02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:50.730]  No.
[02:40:51.010 --> 02:40:54.171]  Smoking goes down massively by more than half.
[02:40:54.901 --> 02:40:55.681]  Pull the numbers up.
[02:40:57.042 --> 02:41:01.365]  And then lung cancer goes up six-fold, and then they say it's cigarette!
[02:41:05.587 --> 02:41:08.109]  And man, I don't know if it's all the coal plants and the mercury.
[02:41:08.149 --> 02:41:09.029]  I don't know what it is.
[02:41:09.970 --> 02:41:14.632]  But studies show women are more susceptible to lung cancer from toxins, and men aren't.
[02:41:15.153 --> 02:41:17.294]  But men are more susceptible to mercury poisoning.
[02:41:17.314 --> 02:41:19.115]  We're different, ladies and gentlemen!
[02:41:23.257 --> 02:41:24.378]  Let me think of the exact headline.
[02:41:24.398 --> 02:41:24.698]  Hold on.
[02:41:24.898 --> 02:41:25.718]  Let me go back to memory.
[02:41:27.779 --> 02:41:28.720]  Let me get it close enough.
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:29.520]  What was the headline?
[02:41:29.540 --> 02:41:31.701]  Because I know you don't believe me out there in your squad car.
[02:41:31.941 --> 02:41:36.083]  You think the American people are your enemy and we're all bad and black scheme asking torture is good.
[02:41:36.969 --> 02:41:38.750]  And I want to reach you, especially.
[02:41:39.350 --> 02:41:41.470]  Female cop, you'll be getting lung cancer soon.
[02:41:41.930 --> 02:41:46.052]  And I just want you, unfortunately, when you're dying, at least then you can be a soldier for us and warn others.
[02:41:46.292 --> 02:41:47.432]  You won't listen until that point.
[02:41:47.712 --> 02:41:53.354]  You'll be 35 dying of lung cancer, or 40, whatever, and you'll never would have smoked, and you'll tell your second-hand smoke did it.
[02:41:53.394 --> 02:41:53.494]  Okay?
[02:41:53.534 --> 02:41:54.814]  I want you to know what killed you.
[02:41:55.034 --> 02:41:56.455]  I want you to know who murdered you.
[02:41:58.035 --> 02:41:59.155]  What was the exact headline?
[02:42:00.996 --> 02:42:02.656]  Lung cancer in women up six-fold.
[02:42:02.676 --> 02:42:03.997]  I think that's it.
[02:42:07.119 --> 02:42:14.205]  Lung cancer in women up.
[02:42:14.945 --> 02:42:15.606]  Let's do that one.
[02:42:18.628 --> 02:42:18.748]  Up.
[02:42:21.690 --> 02:42:22.171]  Let's see that.
[02:42:23.512 --> 02:42:25.213]  Lung cancer in women up.
[02:42:28.336 --> 02:42:28.976]  Where is it here?
[02:42:28.996 --> 02:42:30.237]  I'll find it during the next break.
[02:42:30.257 --> 02:42:32.579]  Got a whole bunch of information.
[02:42:33.640 --> 02:42:35.181]  Lung cancer on rise for women.
[02:42:35.936 --> 02:42:36.937]  One cancer in women.
[02:42:37.817 --> 02:42:39.998]  I've got to actually read into the data to find it for you.
[02:42:40.018 --> 02:42:41.299]  My memory, though, serves on that.
[02:42:41.319 --> 02:42:42.399]  I'm going to run a big deal out of it.
[02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:43.400]  So I'll find that.
[02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:45.021]  Rich in Nevada.
[02:42:46.021 --> 02:42:46.521]  You're on the air.
[02:42:46.561 --> 02:42:46.942]  Go ahead.
[02:42:47.562 --> 02:42:48.142]  How's it going?
[02:42:48.462 --> 02:42:48.803]  Good, sir.
[02:42:50.063 --> 02:42:55.266]  I'm calling to tell you that I bought the DVD, End Game, from Amazon.
[02:42:55.286 --> 02:43:01.069]  I bought a hundred blanks, and I'm going to buy hundreds more blanks and burn DVDs and pass them out.
[02:43:01.149 --> 02:43:03.450]  My family's eating them up like you wouldn't believe.
[02:43:03.530 --> 02:43:04.010]  Good job.
[02:43:06.331 --> 02:43:22.345]  I would like to ask you and encourage your listeners to join me in asking you to ask Trevor Lyman to link BostonTeaParty07.com to Endgame.
[02:43:24.727 --> 02:43:27.049]  Well, we're trying to keep that separated from Ron Paul.
[02:43:27.229 --> 02:43:33.555]  USA Today and a bunch of other publications have already made a big deal out of the fact that Ron Paul's in Endgame.
[02:43:34.486 --> 02:43:38.650]  And so, you know, I'm trying to not put too much heat on the Congressman.
[02:43:40.332 --> 02:43:42.514]  Well, you probably know best about these things.
[02:43:42.574 --> 02:43:43.735]  What did you think of Endgame?
[02:43:43.755 --> 02:43:45.336]  I mean, why is it waking your family up?
[02:43:46.898 --> 02:43:49.480]  Well, here's what happened with one of my sons.
[02:43:49.580 --> 02:43:57.207]  He was listening to Coast to Coast AM, and you were on, and he wanted to learn more, and I said, hey, I have the Endgame DVD.
[02:43:57.227 --> 02:43:58.088]  Do you want to see it?
[02:43:58.188 --> 02:43:59.149]  We watched it together.
[02:43:59.209 --> 02:44:00.050]  We've talked about it.
[02:44:00.986 --> 02:44:11.552]  My other two sons are apolitical, but I'm going to sit them down, we'll watch it, and then they'll pass it out to their friends, I'm sure, because that's a compelling documentary.
[02:44:13.893 --> 02:44:14.333]  Well, good.
[02:44:14.373 --> 02:44:16.314]  It certainly exposes the North American Union.
[02:44:16.414 --> 02:44:17.255]  Anything else, my friend?
[02:44:17.275 --> 02:44:18.075]  I appreciate you holding.
[02:44:18.095 --> 02:44:18.795]  What else is on your mind?
[02:44:19.556 --> 02:44:25.659]  Well, I hate to buck you, man, but I just think that, for one thing, I got the website wrong.
[02:44:25.699 --> 02:44:26.599]  It's TeaParty07.com.
[02:44:28.664 --> 02:44:36.250]  I want people to call up Trevor Lyman or email him at lyman.trevor at gmail.com.
[02:44:36.330 --> 02:44:38.091]  By the way, I'm glad you mentioned him.
[02:44:38.131 --> 02:44:41.894]  I've got to get him on this week because the Tea Party Money Bomb is coming up Sunday.
[02:44:42.394 --> 02:44:43.495]  So I need to start hyping that.
[02:44:44.415 --> 02:44:45.696]  In fact, Aaron, I keep forgetting.
[02:44:45.716 --> 02:44:46.217]  Hey, Aaron.
[02:44:47.658 --> 02:44:48.138]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:44:49.079 --> 02:44:54.783]  Yeah, if he would link Endgame on that site, it would help a lot, man.
[02:44:56.195 --> 02:44:57.056]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:44:57.076 --> 02:44:57.596]  Thank you, sir.
[02:44:57.656 --> 02:44:58.637]  I really appreciate you.
[02:44:59.038 --> 02:45:03.722]  Yeah, I just don't try to make people link to me or push them or use the show to do that because they'll get hundreds of calls.
[02:45:04.262 --> 02:45:06.444]  I do ask the listeners to help spread the word about Endgame.
[02:45:07.145 --> 02:45:08.426]  I mean, I just want to get it out to people.
[02:45:08.466 --> 02:45:09.407]  I just want it to be seen.
[02:45:09.467 --> 02:45:12.329]  And yes, if you, we will save lives.
[02:45:12.369 --> 02:45:16.052]  We can beat the North American Union if you will just get Endgame and make a hundred copies a piece.
[02:45:16.473 --> 02:45:18.334]  That means in the next hundred days, burn a copy.
[02:45:18.394 --> 02:45:22.238]  Every night, go to PrisonPlanet.tv, download it in high quality, burn copies of that.
[02:45:23.849 --> 02:45:29.011]  By the way, I did find the second edition of the... What title is this?
[02:45:29.251 --> 02:45:35.353]  This is a malignant hematology textbook, second edition.
[02:45:37.094 --> 02:45:39.975]  And this is Taylor and Francis.
[02:45:40.915 --> 02:45:46.517]  This is the official medical school cancer research.
[02:45:46.537 --> 02:45:49.438]  It says it's used by Harvard Medical School.
[02:45:51.306 --> 02:46:00.274]  The trend of increasing lung cancer risk with greater numbers of cycles, and it says six-fold increase in women ages 20 to 29.
[02:46:00.615 --> 02:46:01.115]  That was it.
[02:46:01.235 --> 02:46:01.936]  Yes, that was it.
[02:46:01.996 --> 02:46:03.197]  Now I can Google that and find it.
[02:46:03.978 --> 02:46:10.244]  Women 20 to 29 alone have had a six-fold increase in lung cancer.
[02:46:10.924 --> 02:46:11.785]  From 1995 to 2005, and this is an 876 page
[02:46:17.566 --> 02:46:18.828]  We're good to go.
[02:46:31.014 --> 02:46:35.217]  And a six-fold increase in lung cancer for women.
[02:46:35.637 --> 02:46:37.138]  That's the third link.
[02:46:37.558 --> 02:46:39.399]  Lung cancer in women up six-fold.
[02:46:39.459 --> 02:46:40.540]  I typed that into Google.
[02:46:41.100 --> 02:46:41.780]  Third link.
[02:46:42.321 --> 02:46:45.783]  There's 121,000 hits on it.
[02:46:46.363 --> 02:46:48.224]  Probably half of those are on this subject.
[02:46:49.108 --> 02:46:51.009]  Hmm, oh, sixfold, hmm.
[02:46:51.790 --> 02:46:57.973]  Oh, and they say in the study, well, it was footnotes by the government about the study, well that's probably secondhand smoke.
[02:46:58.534 --> 02:46:59.714]  Oh yeah, yeah, right.
[02:47:00.214 --> 02:47:00.555]  Sure.
[02:47:01.235 --> 02:47:04.337]  Smoking goes down below 50%, women who don't even smoke, it explodes.
[02:47:04.557 --> 02:47:05.197]  Uh-huh, yeah.
[02:47:05.878 --> 02:47:07.499]  Uh-huh, sure, that's cigarettes doing it.
[02:47:07.859 --> 02:47:09.800]  We better have a global tax on cigarettes.
[02:47:10.140 --> 02:47:11.521]  That'll save us rights so the U.N.
[02:47:11.541 --> 02:47:13.222]  can use that money to kill us left and right.
[02:47:16.185 --> 02:47:18.506]  In Alabama, if I'm pronouncing that right, I have no idea.
[02:47:18.526 --> 02:47:19.366]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:47:20.107 --> 02:47:20.487]  Hello?
[02:47:20.507 --> 02:47:21.767]  Hi, thanks for holding.
[02:47:22.448 --> 02:47:23.448]  No problem.
[02:47:24.148 --> 02:47:27.430]  I'm hoping this is the right program.
[02:47:27.950 --> 02:47:31.772]  I heard earlier that you had brought up the biblical, Romans 13.
[02:47:35.686 --> 02:47:37.427]  ...that they're gonna try to use against Christians.
[02:47:38.167 --> 02:47:46.210]  And my personal view is I don't see... First of all, I don't think that God ordained this, um, government because it's not a godly one.
[02:47:46.230 --> 02:47:49.612]  Um, and, uh, I guess...
[02:47:50.174 --> 02:47:51.335]  I don't see the correlation.
[02:48:10.174 --> 02:48:11.815]  Oh, I hope I say this clearly.
[02:48:11.835 --> 02:48:20.459]  I don't think that any Christian who knows who God is would actually believe that this is a godly, ordained government.
[02:48:20.639 --> 02:48:24.581]  Not only that, Pastor Hagee has 18,000 members at Cornerstone.
[02:48:24.841 --> 02:48:27.303]  He says Jesus is not the Messiah, and they believe it now.
[02:48:28.143 --> 02:48:28.763]  Oh, yeah.
[02:48:28.943 --> 02:48:30.544]  They'll believe whatever they're told, ma'am.
[02:48:30.864 --> 02:48:32.885]  They believe cancer viruses are nutritious.
[02:48:34.026 --> 02:48:35.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:48:35.067 --> 02:48:36.627]  They believe mercury's good for you.
[02:48:37.428 --> 02:48:39.729]  They believe hell is heaven.
[02:48:40.518 --> 02:48:41.358]  Thank you for the call.
[02:48:41.378 --> 02:48:45.139]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:48.120]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:48.140 --> 02:48:50.260]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.961 --> 02:48:55.182]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful group of governments.
[02:48:55.862 --> 02:48:57.622]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:48:58.683 --> 02:49:00.923]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:49:01.463 --> 02:49:03.864]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.648 --> 02:49:12.003]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.995 --> 02:49:19.976]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.456 --> 02:49:23.917]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:24.317 --> 02:49:26.818]  Build America is making great progress in order world government.
[02:49:26.878 --> 02:49:27.858]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.878 --> 02:49:28.798]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.818 --> 02:49:29.899]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:30.099 --> 02:49:30.839]  They're after power.
[02:49:31.079 --> 02:49:32.099]  That's what they're after, you see.
[02:49:32.239 --> 02:49:36.780]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[02:50:05.549 --> 02:50:06.210]  We're good to go!
[02:50:28.206 --> 02:50:28.887]  We're good to go.

[02:51:33.861 --> 02:51:35.021]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:08.138 --> 02:52:16.220]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, trying to warn the people about this unbelievable corruption and wickedness taking place everywhere.
[02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:23.902]  In the first hour, I got into more on vaccines, more on AIDS being engineered, more on how they put it in the vaccines, how they've been caught.
[02:52:23.982 --> 02:52:25.122]  It was a key first hour.
[02:52:25.762 --> 02:52:30.403]  If you missed any of it or you want to hear it, it's about to restream at InfoWars.com when the live show ends.

[02:52:40.521 --> 02:52:41.402]  We got it first.
[02:52:41.562 --> 02:52:42.563]  We have it in stock.
[02:52:43.364 --> 02:52:47.047]  We're filling the back orders, and we have hundreds more for people that want to order it now.
[02:52:47.127 --> 02:52:51.151]  The minute it sells out, we're taking it off the shopping cart, so you're not going to get back-ordered on it.
[02:52:52.734 --> 02:52:56.016]  Order it now and get it in time for Christmas, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:53:49.629 --> 02:53:49.989]  That's it.
[02:53:50.029 --> 02:53:50.609]  Fred, go ahead.
[02:53:50.629 --> 02:53:51.790]  Hey.
[02:53:52.871 --> 02:54:07.540]  Could you tell me about the seizure of $20 million in Liberty dollars and if there is a strategy that makes sense to get it back?
[02:54:07.640 --> 02:54:09.541]  I don't think they're using the right strategy.
[02:54:09.581 --> 02:54:12.263]  What do you know about it?
[02:54:12.283 --> 02:54:14.605]  What do you know about the agents that were involved in the raid?
[02:54:15.586 --> 02:54:16.467]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:17.387 --> 02:54:18.708]  Man, I could spend an hour on this.
[02:54:19.348 --> 02:54:33.877]  You can type in Liberty Dollar Raid search warrant, seizure warrant, and though it was accidentally released by the idiot feds, I shouldn't say that, maybe they did it on purpose, but they said it was a mistake, and they've sealed it since then.
[02:54:33.917 --> 02:54:34.838]  It's all over the internet.
[02:54:34.938 --> 02:54:36.819]  So you just Google that and it's 30-something pages.
[02:54:38.363 --> 02:54:42.165]  Uh, and they just say it was trying to compete with a fellow reserve.
[02:54:42.666 --> 02:54:44.407]  And they did have reserves for it.
[02:54:44.447 --> 02:54:45.387]  It wasn't $20 million.
[02:54:45.767 --> 02:54:49.549]  They had issued $20 million in currency, but hadn't sold most of it.
[02:54:50.570 --> 02:54:55.612]  But they grabbed tons of silver, a mass of gold, at the facility that had just been delivered from the Mint.
[02:54:56.032 --> 02:55:00.875]  They use the most respected Mint in the world, next to Switzerland that they have up in Idaho.
[02:55:01.981 --> 02:55:02.622]  We're good to go.
[02:55:32.336 --> 02:55:33.536]  Uh, sir, I don't know.
[02:55:33.857 --> 02:55:35.957]  We gotta get Knothouse on, but that's it, get him on to it.
[02:55:36.657 --> 02:55:41.979]  And I'm gonna get Bernadine Smith on, and we're gonna get Trevor Lyman on, a bunch of guests this week.
[02:55:42.359 --> 02:55:44.460]  Mark in Missouri, go ahead, you got 45 seconds.
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:54.562]  Uh, yes, sir, I just want to say, uh, God bless you very much, and, uh, thoughts do travel at light speed, which is 670 million miles an hour, so prayer is good.
[02:55:54.963 --> 02:55:59.684]  Prayer is real good, and we are waking up, and the New World Order's going down because tyranny failed.
[02:56:00.157 --> 02:56:01.137]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
