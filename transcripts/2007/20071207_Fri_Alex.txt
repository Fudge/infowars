[00:00:06.107 --> 00:00:10.290]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.771]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:13.472]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.092 --> 00:00:18.035]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.275 --> 00:00:22.377]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:33.881]  Oh, yeah.
[00:00:42.924 --> 00:00:48.706]  We've got George Humphreys joining us in studio today on this live Friday edition in the third hour.
[00:00:48.806 --> 00:00:56.128]  Former city council member, degreed economist, and of course an author and documentary filmmaker on the New World Order crime syndicate.
[00:00:56.548 --> 00:01:03.710]  I've got him coming in today to mainly talk about the economy and where he thinks it's going in the future because he's a very successful businessman in his own right.
[00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.070]  We're good to go.
[00:01:19.742 --> 00:01:29.029]  He was on with us last Friday, and he came on and discussed the history of education, the underground history of education.
[00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:39.217]  I will tell you, I've researched it all myself, and his information is absolutely accurate and on target, and he even knows quite a bit of stuff that I wasn't aware of that I went and checked into, and it was accurate.
[00:01:39.758 --> 00:01:42.060]  We got up until about 1900.
[00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:47.584]  We looked at the first hundred years of the Prussian model of mind control,
[00:01:48.644 --> 00:01:50.806]  And how it was adopted globally.
[00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:55.231]  And now we're going to look at what happened from 1900 through to today.
[00:01:56.272 --> 00:01:57.433]  And where they're going in the future.
[00:01:58.014 --> 00:02:00.857]  That is coming up in the second hour today.
[00:02:00.877 --> 00:02:07.804]  And of course we are going to take some calls in all three hours.
[00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:09.606]  Including this first one.
[00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:21.950]  And we're going to get into the latest on the Nebraska, Omaha, Nebraska shooter, the latest Ron Paul information, and a lot more coming up today.
[00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:39.657]  There is a story on PrisonPlanet.com that contextualizes the information we covered with Robert Baer, one of the most famous CIA agents in modern history, an actual James Bond type field, commander field officer.
[00:02:41.254 --> 00:02:43.375]  We're going to be doing another interview with him coming up next year.
[00:02:43.415 --> 00:02:49.358]  He's agreed to a full hour, but he talked about the government or other governments staging terror attacks.
[00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.721]  So we're going to break that down first when we get back out of this break.
[00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:57.323]  But right now, I wanted to play just the 911 call.
[00:02:58.423 --> 00:02:59.424]  Several of them coming in.
[00:03:00.385 --> 00:03:02.806]  And then I'm going to come back and comment on this.
[00:03:03.626 --> 00:03:12.848]  Here are some of the 911 calls to one dispatcher from the Omaha, Nebraska mall as the shooter stomped around killing eight people and then himself.
[00:03:13.108 --> 00:03:13.548]  Here it is.
[00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:15.629]  911, what's your emergency?
[00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:15.949]  Hello, 911.
[00:03:32.652 --> 00:03:33.354]  911, what's your emergency?
[00:03:34.056 --> 00:03:36.521]  I'm at Vaughn Mower and I think there's shots being fired all over the place.
[00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:38.866]  Yeah, we're on our way out there.
[00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:39.668]  Anybody been hit?
[00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.271]  I haven't seen anything.
[00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:42.293]  I'm hiding in a clothes rack.
[00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:42.494]  Okay.
[00:03:43.604 --> 00:03:46.468]  We're on our way out there, ma'am.
[00:03:46.568 --> 00:03:48.510]  Okay, we're on our way out there.
[00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:50.793]  Have you seen anybody that was shot?
[00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:51.955]  Okay, we're on our way out there.
[00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:53.577]  Did anybody see the person?
[00:04:02.248 --> 00:04:03.029]  Ma'am?
[00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:03.589]  Ma'am?
[00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.869]  Ma'am?

[00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.430]  Ma'am?
[00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.710]  Ma'am?
[00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.031]  Ma'am?
[00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:06.431]  Ma'am?
[00:04:06.471 --> 00:04:06.691]  Ma'am?
[00:04:06.711 --> 00:04:07.171]  Ma'am?
[00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:07.592]  Ma'am?
[00:04:07.652 --> 00:04:07.912]  Ma'am?

[00:04:14.256 --> 00:04:14.516]  Ma'am?
[00:04:14.556 --> 00:04:14.936]  Ma'am?
[00:04:14.976 --> 00:04:15.156]  Ma'am?
[00:04:15.197 --> 00:04:15.597]  Ma'am?
[00:04:15.637 --> 00:04:15.977]  Ma'am?
[00:04:16.017 --> 00:04:16.497]  Ma'am?
[00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:17.138]  Ma'am?
[00:04:17.198 --> 00:04:17.558]  Ma'am?
[00:04:17.598 --> 00:04:18.038]  Ma'am?
[00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:18.299]  Ma'am?
[00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.599]  Ma'am?
[00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:18.939]  Ma'am?
[00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:19.739]  Ma'am?
[00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:20.080]  Ma'am?
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.460]  Ma'am?
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:20.900]  Ma'am?
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.340]  Ma'am?
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.661]  Ma'am?
[00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:21.921]  Ma'am?
[00:04:22.321 --> 00:04:22.481]  Ma'am?
[00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:22.801]  Ma'am?
[00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:23.222]  Ma'am?
[00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:23.642]  Ma'am?
[00:04:24.102 --> 00:04:24.342]  Ma'am?
[00:04:24.402 --> 00:04:24.763]  Ma'am?
[00:04:24.803 --> 00:04:25.203]  Ma'am?
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.141]  You're shooting at Von Marger, the man dead of.
[00:04:34.902 --> 00:04:35.142]  Okay.
[00:04:35.202 --> 00:04:36.362]  You need an ambulance?
[00:04:36.582 --> 00:04:40.724]  Ambulance is down the road there, but let me stay on the line.
[00:04:41.744 --> 00:04:48.226]  We'll comment on this pathetic situation, saddening situation.
[00:04:50.087 --> 00:04:50.767]  Heart-rending.
[00:04:51.568 --> 00:04:54.509]  On the other side, this is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:58.330]  TruthNews.us is the new powerful website.
[00:05:02.205 --> 00:05:03.625]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.645 --> 00:05:05.726]  A New World Order.
[00:05:06.446 --> 00:05:10.547]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:05:10.587 --> 00:05:13.088]  It's known as the Builder-Birds.
[00:05:14.168 --> 00:05:16.428]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.948 --> 00:05:19.409]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:27.491]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:35.484]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.944 --> 00:05:39.406]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:42.327]  Bill of Rights makes great progress for the world, doesn't he?
[00:05:42.367 --> 00:05:43.368]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.388 --> 00:05:44.308]  They're not after money.
[00:05:44.328 --> 00:05:45.389]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:46.389]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:47.610]  That's what they're after, isn't it?

[00:07:48.996 --> 00:07:50.036]  When they first started pushing this,
[00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:25.217]  Six years ago, we reported on it, and it's been out for a couple weeks now, and I saw it in a stack of news.
[00:08:25.257 --> 00:08:39.752]  I was clearing off my desk, kind of down deep in the pile, several hundred articles deep, about how they've announced that Homeland Security is basically going to run your local fire department and have them spying on you to fight terror and crime.
[00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:48.083]  And it's a huge federalization, plus it is politicizing firefighters and turning them into basically secret police.
[00:08:48.743 --> 00:08:54.186]  And then it deals with a lot of different liability questions about them coming into your home without warrants.
[00:08:55.166 --> 00:08:57.527]  So we'll be discussing that.
[00:08:57.948 --> 00:09:08.373]  I want to finish up right now with the Omaha shooting a few days ago that killed nine people, including the drugged out psychiatric patient that did it.
[00:09:10.282 --> 00:09:17.986]  But let's play just a part of this 9-11 clip, 9-1-1 call, for you, for those that missed it in the last segment.
[00:09:18.006 --> 00:09:18.686]  Listen carefully.
[00:09:18.706 --> 00:09:20.767]  9-1-1, what's your emergency?
[00:09:20.807 --> 00:09:21.048]  Hello, 9-1-1.
[00:09:37.469 --> 00:09:38.331]  911, what's your emergency?
[00:09:39.052 --> 00:09:41.538]  I'm at Vaughn Bower and I think there's shots being fired all over the place.
[00:09:42.259 --> 00:09:43.803]  Yeah, we're on our way out there.
[00:09:43.843 --> 00:09:44.685]  Anybody been hit?
[00:09:45.547 --> 00:09:46.288]  I haven't seen anything.
[00:09:46.328 --> 00:09:47.431]  I'm hiding in a clothes rack.
[00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:47.832]  Okay.
[00:09:48.602 --> 00:09:50.402]  We're on the way out there, ma'am.
[00:09:50.422 --> 00:09:51.903]  I mean, there's been like 50 gunshots.
[00:09:51.983 --> 00:09:55.544]  There is a lot of gun-shooting people in Baltimore at Westroads.
[00:09:55.684 --> 00:09:57.064]  Okay, we're on our way out there.
[00:09:57.124 --> 00:09:59.705]  Have you seen anybody that was shot?
[00:10:00.025 --> 00:10:00.265]  No.
[00:10:00.705 --> 00:10:03.406]  Okay, we're on our way out there.
[00:10:03.446 --> 00:10:05.306]  There's a bunch of people shot.
[00:10:05.386 --> 00:10:06.787]  Oh my God, help us!
[00:10:07.247 --> 00:10:10.027]  Ma'am, get ahold of the ma'am.
[00:10:10.067 --> 00:10:12.608]  She's not going to hear what you're saying, will you?
[00:10:12.728 --> 00:10:13.688]  I don't know.
[00:10:13.748 --> 00:10:16.369]  She thinks there are a bunch of people shot inside of Baltimore.
[00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:20.840]  Now, this is what we've been turned into.
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.700]  Did this stuff happen 50 years ago?
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.121]  Did it happen 100 years ago?
[00:10:24.161 --> 00:10:25.901]  Did it happen 140 years ago?
[00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:26.901]  200 years ago?
[00:10:27.021 --> 00:10:27.242]  No.
[00:10:28.122 --> 00:10:28.882]  It never happened.
[00:10:29.802 --> 00:10:39.005]  Because 100 years ago, if somebody would have gone into a market and started shooting people, every shop clerk kept a gun under the counter.
[00:10:40.526 --> 00:10:44.887]  A lot of citizens carried guns in their purses.
[00:10:46.050 --> 00:11:00.898]  I mean, I know right here in Texas, and there was very little crime, and people weren't having shootouts 50, 60, 70 years ago, I know that most of the women, especially on my dad's side of the family, carried little revolvers in their purses.
[00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:03.680]  They carried revolvers in their cars.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.401]  They carried revolvers.
[00:11:06.581 --> 00:11:13.145]  When they were out riding horses, they carried a rifle in their saddle with them.
[00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:16.568]  Generally a 30-30 Winchester.
[00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:21.950]  And you didn't have these type of people running around doing this.
[00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.192]  Of course you didn't have people on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:11:26.212 --> 00:11:40.779]  And we found at least 10 different news articles with his friends, family, neighbors, and the local news admitting that he was seeing psychiatrists and psychologists and he was on both Ritalin and some type of Prozac class of drugs.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.901]  There was one article in the AP that didn't give a source
[00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:48.184]  This is when you have the drug companies being about happy advertising on the news.
[00:11:48.204 --> 00:11:55.149]  You get stuff like this saying he had been in psychiatric care, but that he wasn't on drugs at the time.
[00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.152]  That was the day of the shooting, two days ago.
[00:11:59.172 --> 00:12:01.073]  In fact, I have the date of the article.
[00:12:01.093 --> 00:12:04.496]  Within three hours of the shooting, no autopsy, no nothing.
[00:12:04.536 --> 00:12:07.058]  This guy hadn't even gotten to the medical examiner yet.
[00:12:07.718 --> 00:12:12.542]  And the AP, read an article about that, came out and said he wasn't on drugs.
[00:12:13.559 --> 00:12:15.380]  Absolute proof that they didn't know that.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.880]  Absolute proof that they made that up.
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.321]  Absolute proof that that's propaganda.
[00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:25.642]  And that reporter needs to be asked why they made that claim and then didn't give a source.
[00:12:27.803 --> 00:12:33.044]  Now it's since come out that he indeed had been on a bunch of medication, just as his friends, family, and neighbors had said.
[00:12:33.064 --> 00:12:38.626]  That he'd been in clinics for serious depression treatment.
[00:12:39.617 --> 00:12:45.301]  And so now I have to have people throw this AP article in my face from the day of the event saying he wasn't on drugs.
[00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:48.263]  Oh, it says he'd been on psychiatric care, but he wasn't on drugs then.
[00:12:49.704 --> 00:12:51.185]  And then you find out he was on drugs.
[00:12:51.725 --> 00:13:05.375]  And he'd moved in with high school friends, and bottom line, because we've seen this in almost all of the cases, in all of the cases they have been on these drugs.
[00:13:07.532 --> 00:13:11.354]  But in most of the cases, they've been playing the shoot-em-up video games.
[00:13:13.675 --> 00:13:18.157]  Now, I'm not saying we should ban the shoot-em-up video games.
[00:13:18.237 --> 00:13:20.378]  I'm not saying that it's their fault this happened.
[00:13:20.398 --> 00:13:33.684]  The point is, you take a mentally ill person, hopped up on drugs, whose own inserts say that it causes suicidal thoughts, violent, erratic actions, psychotic breaks, you have them playing four or five hours a day,
[00:13:34.742 --> 00:13:37.623]  And these are high school boys living together.
[00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:41.205]  I mean, what high school boy doesn't have video games and shoot-em-ups?
[00:13:42.485 --> 00:13:45.706]  I mean, maybe 10% who are Christian homeschoolers, that's probably about it.
[00:13:46.227 --> 00:13:50.628]  Everybody I know, most adults, have shoot-em-up video games.
[00:13:51.469 --> 00:13:56.171]  And you integrate that, and the military invented these games 40 years ago.
[00:13:57.231 --> 00:13:58.732]  35 years ago, at the end of Vietnam.
[00:14:00.032 --> 00:14:04.274]  Because they found that about half the troops, when they were up close to somebody, wouldn't pull the trigger.
[00:14:04.924 --> 00:14:08.747]  In World War II it was over 90% up close wouldn't pull the trigger.
[00:14:08.767 --> 00:14:17.132]  So they started putting them through different simulations where paper targets would pop up to habitualize and create instinctive firing, instinctive shooting.
[00:14:17.652 --> 00:14:21.214]  Now our military is giving that training in video game type simulators.
[00:14:21.975 --> 00:14:26.518]  The game Doom was originally developed, what, 15 years ago?
[00:14:27.672 --> 00:14:29.053]  And used in simulations.
[00:14:29.373 --> 00:14:30.693]  We're going to these corridors.
[00:14:31.334 --> 00:14:33.455]  No shooting and killing in simulations.
[00:14:33.495 --> 00:14:34.175]  Hundreds of people.
[00:14:34.615 --> 00:14:42.799]  And they have now gotten as high as 95% willingness to pull the trigger up close in combat.
[00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:46.700]  Instinctive firing, habitualization, instinctive killing.
[00:14:47.661 --> 00:14:48.901]  Great for your warriors.
[00:14:49.181 --> 00:14:52.823]  Not good when military developed video games.
[00:14:53.974 --> 00:15:00.637]  Now, highly developed to a level of realism that it's almost indistinguishable from reality.
[00:15:00.697 --> 00:15:12.363]  Many of the youth playing these with virtual reality headsets on now, which were originally developed for helicopter and fighter jet fighter pilots, now wearing these playing the games.
[00:15:13.083 --> 00:15:19.006]  And then you take serotonin reuptake inhibitors along with amphetamine-based amphetamines
[00:15:21.081 --> 00:15:21.661]  Stimulants.
[00:15:22.481 --> 00:15:25.222]  And then you add to it the depression that's caused from it.
[00:15:25.862 --> 00:15:34.684]  I mean, it puts the idea into their head, along with the TV and all the media always giving hype and attention to shooters.
[00:15:35.084 --> 00:15:37.125]  And then it becomes a copycat effect.
[00:15:37.865 --> 00:15:45.987]  And now it's in their mind that when you commit suicide, you're not supposed to just go in a closet and blow your head off, which is bad enough.
[00:15:47.054 --> 00:15:51.095]  You're not supposed to just go get in your car and stick the barrel in your mouth and pull the trigger.
[00:15:51.575 --> 00:16:11.780]  No, what you do is, you go into a shopping mall, you go into a school, you go into a church event, you go into a Jewish school, you go into a crowded place, and you start killing people.
[00:16:13.044 --> 00:16:42.730]  And then, of course, the other issue is the patheticness, the sadness of these women just begging for help, begging for someone to help them, begging for 911 to save them as this individual goes through the aisles of the shopping mall, through the goods being sold with the Christmas music dingling and jingling in the background while he blasts people.
[00:16:43.522 --> 00:16:48.784]  Now I'll be honest with you, I haven't gone and gotten a concealed carry because I just don't have the time, the energy.
[00:16:50.424 --> 00:16:57.287]  But I guess it's really becoming the responsibility, even though it turns it right into a privilege, of every able-bodied man and woman.
[00:16:57.787 --> 00:17:02.429]  But I'll tell you, if you didn't grow up with firearms, you need to go take extensive classes with this.
[00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:07.090]  For your own safety, not just the class itself.
[00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.851]  You'll fail the class if you haven't had classes and weren't brought up before.
[00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:12.232]  These are pretty intensive in the states I've looked at.
[00:17:14.347 --> 00:17:25.992]  And, but more importantly than just your safety with the gun, is that if you ever get in a crisis, somebody trying to rob you, somebody busting your house, in that moment of stress, you're going to fumble around with the gun.
[00:17:26.792 --> 00:17:36.496]  And even if you think you're good with a handgun, I don't recommend, what I have in an instant access pistol safe at my home, is revolvers.
[00:17:37.517 --> 00:17:43.279]  What I have here in my broadcast studio is a revolver, in a little instant access safe to my right.
[00:17:44.436 --> 00:17:53.339]  Because, under stress, I might fumble, and guns jam even if they're well-oiled, properly cleaned, and prepared.
[00:17:54.419 --> 00:18:00.682]  And so, I would recommend, personally, that you do that.
[00:18:00.702 --> 00:18:07.924]  And I would also recommend that you have Shearer, or the same, several different companies, air marshal type rounds that anyone can buy.
[00:18:07.944 --> 00:18:09.244]  They're very expensive.
[00:18:09.384 --> 00:18:11.125]  You don't use them for target practice, obviously.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.862]  Uh, that if you shoot a phone book with it, it'll splatter the phone book.
[00:18:15.342 --> 00:18:18.323]  If you shoot a jug of water, it splits and splatters the whole thing.
[00:18:18.644 --> 00:18:21.805]  But it won't, it'll shoot into a wall, but not through a wall.
[00:18:22.626 --> 00:18:25.888]  Because you also want to take down the person you're shooting.
[00:18:25.908 --> 00:18:29.089]  You don't want to kill the woman, or man, or child behind them.
[00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:34.092]  I personally think that police don't like them because they don't go through light armor.
[00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:47.894]  I personally think that police should carry these, because I see every month or so a case, and I'm not blaming the police, you know, they're having to shoot at somebody who's shooting at them, where, you know, the bullet goes through and hits somebody or wounds somebody or comes close to it.
[00:18:48.974 --> 00:18:52.735]  But, plus, they're devastating rounds when they actually hit someone.
[00:18:52.775 --> 00:19:01.298]  Now, in an Internet Access Rack safe, if I have time, into the closet, there is a semi-automatic riot shotgun that holds eight rounds.
[00:19:02.143 --> 00:19:04.405]  And if I have time to get to that, I will.
[00:19:04.445 --> 00:19:12.172]  That's the safest type thing to use, and it's loaded with, I think, number four or five birdshot, about the biggest birdshot there is.
[00:19:12.712 --> 00:19:18.998]  Devastating within 20 yards, but not going to kill my family on the other side of the wall.
[00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:23.622]  Got to kill who you hit with it, but not, and again, I used to go to police
[00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:27.563]  Open police shootouts where they have also shooters.
[00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.864]  You know, it's mainly police that are there.
[00:19:29.884 --> 00:19:32.206]  I'd say about 25% are citizens.
[00:19:32.666 --> 00:19:36.488]  So I picked all this up from them back when I was a teenager and had time to do such things.
[00:19:36.508 --> 00:19:40.951]  So this is all what police were training everybody in going through these deals.
[00:19:41.351 --> 00:19:43.732]  Wish I had time to do that more today, but I don't.
[00:19:43.752 --> 00:19:47.595]  In fact, my skills with a firearm are probably 20% of what they were 10 years ago.
[00:19:48.035 --> 00:19:49.215]  It erodes very quickly.
[00:19:49.976 --> 00:19:51.597]  So again, this is something
[00:19:52.339 --> 00:19:54.644]  Everybody needs to do it, and I'm going to get a concealed carry.
[00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:55.746]  That's the end of it.
[00:19:56.327 --> 00:20:00.656]  Not just for these shooters, these mass shootings, but for robberies, all the rest of it.
[00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:05.414]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:20:05.714 --> 00:20:09.277]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[00:21:03.147 --> 00:21:05.229]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:14.778]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:21:15.218 --> 00:21:22.425]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:21:23.135 --> 00:21:28.620]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:22:02.311 --> 00:22:04.151]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:22:04.291 --> 00:22:10.993]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:22:11.253 --> 00:22:19.415]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:22:19.635 --> 00:22:25.416]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:22:25.436 --> 00:22:26.576]  My blood pressure has
[00:22:26.816 --> 00:22:27.317]  I think so.
[00:22:43.851 --> 00:22:44.572]  We're good to go.
[00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:02.390]  It's a fact.
[00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:10.092]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:23:10.192 --> 00:23:19.074]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:23:19.334 --> 00:23:29.877]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:23:30.137 --> 00:23:36.221]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:23:36.421 --> 00:23:41.444]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:23:41.624 --> 00:23:46.106]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:23:46.286 --> 00:23:48.087]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:23:48.127 --> 00:23:48.408]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:48.848]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:50.809]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:23:57.773 --> 00:24:00.935]  If you'd like to learn more, visit FDRS.org today.
[00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.450]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:38.571 --> 00:24:46.052]  I really do recommend that everybody out there go take basic firearms training classes with handguns, rifles, shotguns.
[00:24:46.452 --> 00:24:47.472]  They're very inexpensive.
[00:24:47.532 --> 00:24:50.653]  Every major town and city, even small towns, have the training.
[00:24:50.693 --> 00:24:54.354]  Do that first if you've never been associated and been around firearms.
[00:24:55.174 --> 00:24:58.675]  And then you can start getting in the junior league competitions.
[00:24:59.155 --> 00:25:03.996]  And then you can get up to the higher level competitions that they have out at different training facilities.
[00:25:04.396 --> 00:25:05.636]  And again, it'll be mainly police.
[00:25:07.658 --> 00:25:09.158]  FBI, you name it, is out there.
[00:25:09.458 --> 00:25:10.759]  They used to get real mad.
[00:25:11.099 --> 00:25:14.319]  Dr. Dillingham, one of my dads, a dentist that worked for him, got me into it.
[00:25:14.339 --> 00:25:17.260]  The boys would get irritated.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.560]  I was like 17, 18, 19.
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:21.181]  Because I'd be in the top 10%.
[00:25:21.601 --> 00:25:23.181]  You have a couple hundred shooters out there.
[00:25:24.541 --> 00:25:28.102]  And I'd be out there going through all the obstacle courses and the rest of it.
[00:25:28.802 --> 00:25:32.263]  And they had it with shotguns, rifles, long-distance shooting, and the rest of it.
[00:25:33.485 --> 00:25:39.950]  I wish I would have stayed in it, but I just didn't have time to go out every month or drive to Dallas or drive to San Antonio.
[00:25:41.511 --> 00:25:45.755]  Back then also they had some little shootouts, little competitions at the Hill Country Rifle Range.
[00:25:46.195 --> 00:25:48.617]  Back in Travis County they used to have their training facility out there.
[00:25:49.438 --> 00:25:52.260]  But I'm already digressing off of that.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:26:01.447]  Just to hear those women, the fear in their voices, and to realize that, and with firearms it's a great responsibility.
[00:26:02.444 --> 00:26:03.345]  And you've got to weigh it.
[00:26:05.907 --> 00:26:09.389]  Do you want your wife with a concealed carry handgun in her purse?
[00:26:09.429 --> 00:26:10.290]  Do you have children?
[00:26:10.951 --> 00:26:15.334]  When your wife gets home every day, she's got to go put it in the instant access pistol safe.
[00:26:15.754 --> 00:26:16.495]  You've got to do it.
[00:26:16.815 --> 00:26:23.060]  But at the same time, you've got to train your children and discipline them never to touch a gun.
[00:26:24.609 --> 00:26:33.611]  Instead, parents just never even talk about guns, don't have guns, and those almost always are the houses where the children then get the gun out of the closet and shoot themselves.
[00:26:34.031 --> 00:26:35.452]  Or shoot the other kid that's over.
[00:26:36.352 --> 00:26:37.532]  Because they were never taught.
[00:26:37.612 --> 00:26:38.612]  They were never shown a gun.
[00:26:38.652 --> 00:26:39.793]  They were never given the training.
[00:26:40.193 --> 00:26:41.253]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:26:42.273 --> 00:26:49.595]  To see the firearms training that was universal in this nation up until about 40 years ago being completely phased out.
[00:26:50.709 --> 00:27:05.739]  I mean, I was given, growing up, and I didn't know at the time, now I've read the history of firearms in this country, several books on it, interviewed experts, that I was given the standard, really, training that was given for hundreds of years, even on the frontier.
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:11.744]  And I had no idea how valuable all that training was.
[00:27:11.804 --> 00:27:17.928]  And then, you know, it happened when I was eight years old, being given, with all the old World War II vets,
[00:27:18.712 --> 00:27:23.995]  You know, how to breathe, how to squeeze, how to, you know, distance, even windage.
[00:27:24.575 --> 00:27:27.997]  I had no idea the training I was being given, how valuable it was.
[00:27:28.037 --> 00:27:29.838]  I thought this was just normal.
[00:27:30.319 --> 00:27:31.199]  And it was normal.
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:42.906]  With, you know, all the old World War II vets that would hunt on our family farm and ranch out in East Texas, and my grandfather, and then of course my dad and uncle and others that were trained by them.
[00:27:43.835 --> 00:27:51.938]  And I'm telling you, now that I've gotten off into the Second Amendment, I literally could shoot the same hole, even with wind, at 200 yards.
[00:27:52.158 --> 00:27:52.798]  Same hole.
[00:27:53.538 --> 00:27:56.359]  With a .30-06, with a nice Leopold scope on it.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:09.924]  Now today, I can just shoot a ragged hole at 200 yards, even if I'm lucky, and I can still shoot a deer facing me straight on in the head, or in the chest, but then it ruins all the meat at 600 yards.
[00:28:14.204 --> 00:28:17.466]  Sounds like I'm bragging about firearms, or how good I am with them.
[00:28:17.486 --> 00:28:18.126]  I'm not that good.
[00:28:18.546 --> 00:28:20.687]  There are people out there ten times better.
[00:28:21.108 --> 00:28:24.569]  The point is, is that this is a dying art.
[00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:31.012]  I mean, I've been so busy, I'm not... I haven't really trained my five-year-old yet.
[00:28:31.313 --> 00:28:32.733]  And you think, well, that's young.
[00:28:32.753 --> 00:28:33.914]  Well, that's when they started training me.
[00:28:34.014 --> 00:28:35.895]  Just about safety, not truly shooting.
[00:28:37.972 --> 00:28:45.358]  It's not like when I was four they taught me the power of a gun by sitting me down in my grandpa's lap and shooting Folgers coffee cans with a .410.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:51.424]  But I thought that was crazy years later when I thought about it and I learned that's standard.
[00:28:51.884 --> 00:28:56.208]  First you teach them how dangerous and scary they are just with a demonstration at four.
[00:28:56.808 --> 00:28:59.891]  Then at five you teach them about all the mechanics of a firearm.
[00:29:00.592 --> 00:29:11.359]  And then when you do anything wrong, even when it's unloaded, then they chastise you, like it's something really special you get to do, and then now you don't get to, you know, shoot anymore until next time you're at the farm.
[00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:18.103]  And then that's how you habitualize safety procedures with a firearm.
[00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:24.427]  And someone out there who's trained later in life can never be as good
[00:29:25.313 --> 00:29:34.939]  No matter how much training they put in, according to the experts I've interviewed and talked to, as someone who was habitualized to the proper use of a firearm at a very young age.
[00:29:35.559 --> 00:29:37.160]  Well, I certainly digressed there, didn't I?
[00:29:37.561 --> 00:29:42.324]  Bayer suggests Saudis could stage terror attack in America to instigate Iran attack.
[00:29:42.544 --> 00:29:44.125]  We'll cover that and a lot more when we get back.
[00:29:44.145 --> 00:29:44.585]  Stay with us.
[00:29:52.313 --> 00:29:55.354]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.414 --> 00:29:59.155]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.976 --> 00:30:03.456]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.

[00:30:22.182 --> 00:30:25.783]  Two books that combined are over a thousand pages and other information.

[00:31:01.517 --> 00:31:05.781]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:10.925]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:31:11.146 --> 00:31:12.487]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:12.647 --> 00:31:16.010]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calvin Pursos?

[00:31:36.428 --> 00:31:37.369]  No animal testing.
[00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:39.091]  I use them and love them.
[00:31:39.111 --> 00:31:40.572]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[00:31:40.852 --> 00:31:41.993]  And I say big time.

[00:33:45.107 --> 00:34:03.281]  Welcome back, Steve Everett, Chris, Aaron, Michael, everybody.
[00:34:03.301 --> 00:34:05.643]  We're going to get to your calls.
[00:34:06.124 --> 00:34:11.048]  I'm also going to cover, Bayer suggests Saudis could stage terror attack in America.
[00:34:11.904 --> 00:34:13.666]  Instigate Iran attack.
[00:34:14.026 --> 00:34:24.897]  CIA veteran also has questions about why alleged masterminds were being protected before 9-11 and goes on to say 9-11 has serious aspects pointing towards an inside job.
[00:34:25.838 --> 00:34:27.660]  We'll break down this incredible article.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.402]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:30.603 --> 00:34:31.804]  Top story right now.
[00:34:31.944 --> 00:34:33.466]  Also, they're recruiting firefighters
[00:34:34.176 --> 00:34:39.577]  To be spies for the federal government, but not to just, quote, fight terror, but also fight crime.
[00:34:39.597 --> 00:34:40.838]  Total federalization.
[00:34:41.438 --> 00:34:42.398]  Very, very serious.
[00:34:42.538 --> 00:34:43.218]  That is coming up.
[00:34:43.458 --> 00:34:51.541]  We have John Taylor Goddard, top educator, to talk about the underground history of education, the brainwashing by design, part two.
[00:34:51.901 --> 00:34:53.481]  We went up to 1900 or so.
[00:34:53.941 --> 00:34:55.982]  Last week, we're going to be covering the next
[00:34:58.318 --> 00:35:00.680]  100 years plus coming up in the next hour.
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:05.083]  Then George Humphrey, my good friend and economist, will talk about our imploding economy.
[00:35:05.483 --> 00:35:08.225]  Housing prices down more than 15% just this year.
[00:35:08.245 --> 00:35:11.847]  They're talking about down 30% by early next year.
[00:35:12.107 --> 00:35:17.791]  That's the federal government saying that and major private institutions have analyzed that.
[00:35:18.432 --> 00:35:22.554]  Very, very serious things that are happening right now.
[00:35:24.875 --> 00:35:31.119]  I was just talking about people getting concealed carry, or at least getting trained with firearms, having them in an instant-access pistol safe.
[00:35:31.159 --> 00:35:35.102]  I mean, you hit four or five numbers, door pops open, boom, got your firearm.
[00:35:35.482 --> 00:35:37.363]  It's safe around the children because it's locked up.
[00:35:37.904 --> 00:35:42.347]  We have to get back to being independent, self-sufficient.
[00:35:42.707 --> 00:35:48.111]  The system wants us calling up, help me, there's a shooter in the vault!
[00:35:48.431 --> 00:35:50.032]  He's killing people!
[00:35:50.052 --> 00:35:51.233]  I mean, you've just...
[00:35:51.975 --> 00:35:54.736]  One out of ten people had a concealed carry and had a gun in there.
[00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:56.757]  They would have started shooting back at that guy.
[00:35:56.777 --> 00:36:04.399]  He might have been able to kill one or two people, but by the time we've seen instances of where this has happened in schools and businesses, somebody does pull a gun and start shooting.
[00:36:04.419 --> 00:36:06.840]  They can either take him out or make him go for cover.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.921]  Or we can just sit there and go, please help me!
[00:36:13.242 --> 00:36:17.363]  Again, it's horrible to hear those type of things happen.
[00:36:18.365 --> 00:36:21.166]  That's why I tell you to get high quality water filtration systems.
[00:36:21.587 --> 00:36:23.528]  That's why I tell you to try to have a piece of property.
[00:36:23.548 --> 00:36:25.849]  Even if you live in the city, have a few acres, five, ten acres.
[00:36:26.149 --> 00:36:26.429]  Cheap!
[00:36:26.889 --> 00:36:28.970]  You know, could be fifty miles outside town, a hundred miles.
[00:36:29.871 --> 00:36:33.333]  Preferably with a well water on it, and you know, stuff stored there.
[00:36:33.353 --> 00:36:33.913]  Even a shack.
[00:36:34.514 --> 00:36:44.899]  I mean, it's important in the society we live in, where the government's saying we will have bioterror attacks, and we will have food problems, and we will have a huge recession.
[00:36:45.259 --> 00:36:46.439]  Could be total depression.
[00:36:46.879 --> 00:36:47.940]  I mean, that is scary.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.461]  I hope that stuff doesn't happen.
[00:36:50.441 --> 00:36:54.923]  But I remember having Steve Shank on six months ago, and he was saying, oh, we're already having food shortages.
[00:36:55.203 --> 00:36:57.444]  We're trying to buy up as much food as we can at lower prices.
[00:36:57.744 --> 00:36:58.805]  Now it's in the news!
[00:36:59.165 --> 00:37:01.606]  They're talking about 20% increases this year.
[00:37:01.946 --> 00:37:02.967]  Another 30, 40% increase next year.
[00:37:04.776 --> 00:37:06.217]  I mean, this stuff is real.
[00:37:06.317 --> 00:37:07.698]  I don't know what's going to happen next year.
[00:37:07.778 --> 00:37:11.501]  I hope it's on the good side, where we just have a serious recession.
[00:37:11.901 --> 00:37:13.522]  But on the bad side, it could be a lot worse.
[00:37:13.922 --> 00:37:15.863]  And this is an insurance policy you can eat.
[00:37:16.244 --> 00:37:25.330]  And Steve Shank joins us for this segment from the J. Michael Stevens Group, where I've gotten storable foods twice from, and I'm about to get even more.
[00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:26.831]  Steve, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:37:27.391 --> 00:37:29.633]  Hey, it's great to be here, Alex.
[00:37:29.693 --> 00:37:34.416]  We're going to, on this particular segment, I didn't know it when we set this up,
[00:37:34.956 --> 00:37:40.899]  But we're going to connect some dots that no one else in the country is going to connect and it's going to be announced here the first thing.
[00:37:40.959 --> 00:37:46.862]  And so any of your listeners had better take some notes from what you and I are going to talk about in the next 10 minutes.
[00:37:47.443 --> 00:37:48.003]  Absolutely.
[00:37:49.083 --> 00:37:49.704]  Here's the deal.
[00:37:50.544 --> 00:37:54.026]  I'm going to start out with this, folks, and don't be offended.
[00:37:54.606 --> 00:37:55.747]  I'm really upset.
[00:37:55.827 --> 00:37:59.409]  And so I tend to get a little bit Gentile with my language.
[00:37:59.509 --> 00:38:01.070]  But here's the deal.
[00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:03.471]  I want you
[00:38:04.571 --> 00:38:07.773]  All of you listeners out there to take down this phone number.
[00:38:07.813 --> 00:38:09.394]  This is the J. Michael Stevens Group.
[00:38:09.434 --> 00:38:10.655]  This is not a commercial.
[00:38:10.715 --> 00:38:12.756]  This is your life you're dependent on.
[00:38:13.357 --> 00:38:16.639]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:38:16.659 --> 00:38:19.841]  800-409-5633.
[00:38:20.341 --> 00:38:22.763]  After you hear what Alex and I are going to talk about.
[00:38:23.423 --> 00:38:26.846]  And this is where you order food while it's still available.
[00:38:27.906 --> 00:38:30.548]  You can put in a multiplicity of your supplies.
[00:38:31.263 --> 00:38:40.069]  Those of you who can't hack a year's supply that needs something for grab-and-run, they also have a little Patriot Pack in there that's a two-month supply.
[00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:49.596]  But I want you to take that number down, and then also those of you who are computer literate, write down eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:38:49.656 --> 00:38:55.320]  That's E, the letter E, F-O-O-D-S-D-I-R-E-C-T dot com.
[00:38:56.272 --> 00:39:20.045]  And that's where you're going to find out more information about getting a supply in, because after Alex and I talk about what we're going to discuss and the dots that we're going to connect this morning, if you don't get a food supply in that's deadly serious, forget about Christmas, forget about the next birthday and the next vacation, a food supply that's deadly serious, you've got to be dumber than a box of rocks.
[00:39:20.845 --> 00:39:22.366]  And here's where we're going, Alex.
[00:39:23.927 --> 00:39:24.507]  We are now
[00:39:25.979 --> 00:39:49.251]  Five years ago, on my radio programs and talking with you, I made the statement that if we as American citizens, or whatever we want to call ourselves, the population of America, we Americans, if we have not stored it previous to the contamination, or do not raise it ourselves, we will not dare eat it.
[00:39:49.752 --> 00:39:54.214]  For the last three months, we have consistently tracked
[00:39:55.313 --> 00:40:02.849]  Every one of my shows that I put on, Alex, what I've done is I started out with announcing the current recall of food.
[00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:05.655]  Huge recalls usually of meat.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.941]  Every single week.
[00:40:08.361 --> 00:40:10.022]  Sometimes several each week.
[00:40:10.722 --> 00:40:11.302]  Every week.
[00:40:11.322 --> 00:40:25.948]  I had millions of cans of chili and every other meat little product of a huge plant here in Texas and they admitted, this is two months ago, that it was a dog food plant in the same plant making human meat and it all had botulism in it.
[00:40:25.988 --> 00:40:27.249]  And that barely made the news.
[00:40:27.909 --> 00:40:29.610]  Yeah, but you know why we're hearing about it?
[00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:33.031]  Five years ago we didn't hear about any food contaminated.
[00:40:33.564 --> 00:40:44.913]  And I've been marveling at the fact, why is it, for the last three months, every single week we've had multiplicities of recalls of food because of contamination.
[00:40:45.253 --> 00:40:46.234]  Now we know why.
[00:40:47.115 --> 00:40:48.296]  What they're proposing.
[00:40:48.772 --> 00:40:49.612]  To protect us.
[00:40:49.972 --> 00:40:56.554]  Remember, several months ago, maybe a year or so ago, we had that big outbreak of E. coli with spinach?
[00:40:57.394 --> 00:40:58.874]  In fact, I just got this yesterday.
[00:40:58.914 --> 00:41:01.595]  They're saying they're going to irradiate everything, basically.
[00:41:01.695 --> 00:41:02.535]  That's the point.
[00:41:03.255 --> 00:41:08.996]  Now, why on earth would you be thinking in terms of wiping out E. coli bacteria on spinach?
[00:41:09.016 --> 00:41:11.877]  Spinach, you know where E. coli comes from, Alex?
[00:41:12.217 --> 00:41:14.097]  It comes from poop, for Pete's sake.
[00:41:14.698 --> 00:41:16.298]  And spinach doesn't do that.
[00:41:17.338 --> 00:41:21.900]  So how did it get on there enough to contaminate 20, spinach in 20 states?
[00:41:22.641 --> 00:41:24.041]  Now we've got the answer.
[00:41:24.221 --> 00:41:30.104]  But you just said, they're talking about irradiating, irradiating leafy vegetables.
[00:41:30.544 --> 00:41:41.070]  They're trying to, and by the way I didn't even know you were going to come up with this Steve, I got this yesterday, hadn't covered it yet, the proposing Congress on the verge of passing a law where they're going to basically irradiate even almonds.
[00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:44.051]  Yeah, no, no, but it's even worse.
[00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:45.912]  They're going to pasteurize almonds.
[00:41:46.548 --> 00:41:48.530]  Let me tell you about the almond thing.
[00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:49.851]  California.
[00:41:50.271 --> 00:42:02.840]  Okay, now, you gotta realize, folks, those of you who are not health nuts, vegans, those are people who won't eat any animal products at all, and vegetarians rely heavily upon almonds.
[00:42:03.281 --> 00:42:10.747]  They make almond milk, they do a lot of things with almonds, sometimes up to 70% of their diet is based on almonds.
[00:42:11.487 --> 00:42:15.190]  Now, as a result of this pasteurization thing,
[00:42:15.883 --> 00:42:20.926]  They're going to require that all almonds be pasteurized, all raw almonds be pasteurized.
[00:42:20.966 --> 00:42:26.690]  The only place you're going to be able to get raw almonds is in roadside stands during the production season.
[00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:33.654]  Other than that, other than that, the almonds will be required to be pasteurized.
[00:42:34.184 --> 00:42:39.808]  That's just as bad as irradiation, only it doesn't kill you quite as fast.
[00:42:40.048 --> 00:42:45.772]  But the fact is, it completely destroys the enzyme activity in the almond, which is what the health nuts are after.
[00:42:46.513 --> 00:42:46.873]  Okay?
[00:42:47.273 --> 00:42:55.039]  You've got to realize that other countries, the reason the almond growers are going nuts over this, is that we export.
[00:42:55.079 --> 00:43:00.863]  California is the only state in the nation that grows almonds, and we export a tremendous amount.
[00:43:01.403 --> 00:43:03.665]  Other countries have outlawed
[00:43:04.389 --> 00:43:08.572]  The importing of pasteurized almonds because they're completely useless.
[00:43:08.672 --> 00:43:15.276]  The government is doing everything they can to destroy family farms with the premises ID, with the animal ID.
[00:43:15.696 --> 00:43:23.501]  I mean, it is just, they're doing everything they can to shut down the small and even medium-sized ranchers and farmers in this country.
[00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:29.844]  And then you have the destruction of the dollar happening and it's already rising in prices.
[00:43:30.305 --> 00:43:32.186]  Well now, you've got to understand this.
[00:43:32.913 --> 00:43:37.057]  Remember the statement that I made earlier on in this little segment here.
[00:43:37.958 --> 00:43:43.384]  If you have not previously stored it, this is the message to you folks.
[00:43:44.024 --> 00:43:50.070]  Right now you can get food that is not contaminated, has not been irradiated, has not been pasteurized.
[00:43:50.471 --> 00:43:54.575]  In fact, the one thing that they've changed with regard to labeling Alex
[00:43:55.299 --> 00:44:03.189]  Is that they're now allowing people who are irradiating food, completely destroying the enzymes, and I'm going to read you a list of what's irradiated.
[00:44:03.209 --> 00:44:04.551]  They're calling it pasteurized.
[00:44:04.691 --> 00:44:06.834]  They're going to be able to call it pasteurized.
[00:44:07.675 --> 00:44:10.696]  By the way, folks, I have the law in front of me.
[00:44:10.936 --> 00:44:12.637]  In fact, I didn't even know you were bringing this up, Steve.
[00:44:12.857 --> 00:44:13.977]  I know they're listening in the other room.
[00:44:13.997 --> 00:44:15.138]  Folks, bring in that file.
[00:44:15.458 --> 00:44:17.078]  Go ahead.
[00:44:17.598 --> 00:44:33.904]  Anyway, the point that I was making was remember we said five years ago, Alex and I have been in accord on this forever, and that's if you did not previously store it, previous to the destruction of your food, or if you do not grow it yourself,
[00:44:35.273 --> 00:44:37.134]  You will not dare eat it.
[00:44:37.474 --> 00:44:39.876]  It won't be a matter of whether it'll make you healthy or not.
[00:44:40.056 --> 00:44:45.178]  You won't dare eat it because now we're talking about irradiation.
[00:44:45.699 --> 00:44:46.319]  Listen to this.
[00:44:46.699 --> 00:44:48.700]  This is from an article on irradiation.
[00:44:49.201 --> 00:45:02.768]  Research has revealed a wide range of problems in animals that eat irradiated food including premature death, a rare form of cancer, reproductive dysfunction,
[00:45:04.532 --> 00:45:19.038]  Chromosomal abnormalities, liver damage, low weight gain, vitamin deficiencies, irradiation destroys vitamins, disrupts chemical composition of food,
[00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:29.102]  Because now it can just be based in bacteria, maggots, feces, you name it.
[00:45:29.382 --> 00:45:31.924]  They can just wash it off with bleach, as they're already doing.
[00:45:32.264 --> 00:45:42.391]  Three years ago they legalized, and most meatpacking is doing this, viral sprays, where they spray live virus on the meat that then eats bacteria.
[00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:49.072]  You better control your food, and the way you control your food is you put in a five-year supply of it so you can rise yourself.
[00:45:49.132 --> 00:45:52.373]  By the way, Steve, you're not even trying to scare people.
[00:45:52.433 --> 00:45:53.474]  This is really happening.
[00:45:53.754 --> 00:45:59.516]  Why do you think the establishment of the system is just going wild right now with viral sprays?
[00:45:59.536 --> 00:46:05.378]  By the way, if you don't believe me, folks, just type viruses sprayed on meat.
[00:46:05.758 --> 00:46:06.498]  I'll do it on Google.
[00:46:06.518 --> 00:46:06.958]  Keep talking.
[00:46:07.419 --> 00:46:11.080]  Well, you know, the interesting thing, guys, you know, people don't want
[00:46:12.168 --> 00:46:15.410]  They don't want food that has been decontaminated.
[00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:31.882]  What pasteurization, what this irradiation does, is it leaves the vomit and everything else that's in the food and it just, it supposedly just kills all the germs.
[00:46:31.982 --> 00:46:35.505]  We can't, what it allows, sorry, feces.
[00:46:36.167 --> 00:46:36.547]  Okay.
[00:46:38.489 --> 00:46:39.270]  I apologize.
[00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.612]  I apologize to our listening audience.
[00:46:41.652 --> 00:46:42.412]  It's alright.
[00:46:42.432 --> 00:46:42.973]  Just go ahead.
[00:46:43.273 --> 00:46:44.054]  Okay, anyway.
[00:46:44.694 --> 00:46:50.499]  We can't... What it allows the producers to do is leave that junk on the food.
[00:46:50.879 --> 00:46:52.301]  We want clean food.
[00:46:52.741 --> 00:46:57.585]  We don't want stuff that's been decontaminated.
[00:46:57.805 --> 00:46:59.226]  We don't want the contaminated food.
[00:46:59.526 --> 00:47:00.587]  But here's the whole point.
[00:47:02.149 --> 00:47:03.089]  Now, if you've got
[00:47:05.831 --> 00:47:19.803]  All of those things going on with irradiation and we have those of you who have listened to us before know that the seeds are being eliminated that will regrow themselves.
[00:47:19.923 --> 00:47:21.184]  What they call heritage seeds.
[00:47:21.524 --> 00:47:22.725]  Now listen to this Alex.
[00:47:24.207 --> 00:47:33.014]  Bill Gates, Billy Bob Gates and most of you realize that the ones that are genetically altering the seeds
[00:47:34.018 --> 00:47:38.882]  that are creating plants that will make you glow in the dark, walk sideways, and one eye travel to the other side of your head.
[00:47:39.362 --> 00:47:41.444]  Monsanto Corporation is just ahead of that.
[00:47:41.464 --> 00:47:44.025]  Here are the people that are involved in this.
[00:47:44.966 --> 00:48:00.637]  Bill Gates is investing tens of millions along with the Rockefeller Foundation, Monsanto Corporation, Syngenta Foundation, and the government of Norway, and they're building a, what they call,
[00:48:02.418 --> 00:48:02.799]  Excuse me.
[00:48:03.179 --> 00:48:05.123]  A Doomsday Seed Vault.
[00:48:06.345 --> 00:48:09.931]  They have over 3 million varieties of different
[00:48:10.924 --> 00:48:25.209]  And let me tell you what the head of Monsanto in 99 said, this was even in major publications, he said that the policy is to contaminate everything so that people have to accept the GMO and so that they will then control the heirloom seeds.
[00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:35.852]  But since I mentioned viral meat, ABC News, okay, I typed viruses spray on meat into Google, thousands of articles came up, viral meat spray advancing food safety.
[00:48:36.548 --> 00:48:41.010]  And it says, uh, water will not wash away E. coli, Salmonella, or Listeria.
[00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:47.393]  Now the FDA approved a spring on some foods like cold cuts with viruses in an effort to stop certain bacteria.
[00:48:48.214 --> 00:48:48.574]  Go ahead.
[00:48:49.214 --> 00:48:59.159]  Well, the interesting thing that we're dealing with, guys, is if we don't take control of our food, and I'm talking about at the family level, food will control us.
[00:49:01.154 --> 00:49:05.977]  They've always said they'd use food as a weapon, but see, we need to give them the toll-free number.
[00:49:06.117 --> 00:49:10.680]  Okay, it's 800-409-5633.
[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:11.901]  800-409-5633.
[00:49:11.921 --> 00:49:15.703]  Now, you realize that our little gals are going to be covered up with calls.
[00:49:15.903 --> 00:49:16.603]  That's fine.
[00:49:17.324 --> 00:49:20.726]  But what you must do... Now, here's the deal, guys.
[00:49:21.626 --> 00:49:22.627]  On the food supplies,
[00:49:23.439 --> 00:49:27.741]  We have extended the holiday pack as far as we can.
[00:49:28.081 --> 00:49:33.664]  We've only got about 200 of them left, and we already added another 400 of the numbers that we started with.
[00:49:34.344 --> 00:49:35.425]  So get that stuff ordered.
[00:49:35.685 --> 00:49:40.447]  We aren't going to be able to probably get the full units out before Christmas, obviously.
[00:49:40.487 --> 00:49:41.928]  We're too stacked up.
[00:49:42.568 --> 00:49:44.709]  But what you need to do is get your orders in.
[00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:48.531]  Well, we can still get food that we trust shipped to you.
[00:49:48.811 --> 00:49:55.213]  If we're able, Alex, to ship food into the next three months of this coming year, I'll be happy as a hog in a peach orchard.
[00:49:55.733 --> 00:49:58.634]  It's just disappearing too fast and things are going too nuts.
[00:49:59.014 --> 00:50:04.296]  And now with this foolishness, we at the point where we can't trust the food.
[00:50:04.336 --> 00:50:06.657]  Now, we came out with a notation
[00:50:07.344 --> 00:50:14.650]  Probably about three months ago when you and I talked, Alex, where Dow Chemical was petitioning the U.S.
[00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:17.793]  Department of Agriculture and EPA... To spray fluoride on the crops.
[00:50:17.853 --> 00:50:21.196]  Yeah, to spray fluoride on the stored food.
[00:50:21.996 --> 00:50:25.179]  Now they're wanting to irradiate the green stuff.
[00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:28.765]  And spray fluoride on the grains and things.
[00:50:28.985 --> 00:50:30.606]  Look, folks, he's not kidding.
[00:50:30.686 --> 00:50:31.407]  It's all happening.
[00:50:31.427 --> 00:50:32.988]  They're taking over all the industries.
[00:50:33.008 --> 00:50:35.390]  This is about monopolies and control.

[00:50:50.223 --> 00:50:51.664]  Steve, let me talk to you during the break.
[00:50:51.684 --> 00:50:53.305]  This is just amazing information.
[00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:57.832]  Billy brings it all home, this perfect storm of things that are happening.
[00:50:58.152 --> 00:51:00.773]  And it only goes from bad to worse.
[00:51:02.414 --> 00:51:03.855]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:05.956]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.676 --> 00:51:11.098]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:11.519 --> 00:51:13.760]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:16.641]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:17.182 --> 00:51:19.583]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:20.331 --> 00:51:27.695]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.689 --> 00:51:35.672]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:36.133 --> 00:51:39.635]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:40.015 --> 00:51:42.517]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:42.577 --> 00:51:43.558]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.578 --> 00:51:44.478]  They're not after money.
[00:51:44.498 --> 00:51:45.599]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.799 --> 00:51:46.540]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.800]  That's what they're after.

[00:51:59.468 --> 00:52:00.489]  You have been warned.
[00:52:01.709 --> 00:52:04.871]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:04.911 --> 00:52:08.952]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:11.653]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:11.713 --> 00:52:14.034]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:14.234 --> 00:52:22.678]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:22.738 --> 00:52:24.058]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[00:52:24.178 --> 00:52:28.200]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:28.700]  We're good to go.
[00:52:56.884 --> 00:53:08.272]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:53:08.712 --> 00:53:13.415]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:53:13.835 --> 00:53:16.457]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:53:16.958 --> 00:53:20.300]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:53:21.121 --> 00:53:25.450]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:53:25.911 --> 00:53:29.078]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:53:29.699 --> 00:53:32.525]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:53:33.286 --> 00:53:38.450]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:45.575]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:53:46.076 --> 00:53:46.336]  U.S.
[00:53:46.416 --> 00:53:49.638]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[00:53:49.978 --> 00:53:52.921]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:53:53.081 --> 00:53:57.484]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:53:57.884 --> 00:53:58.625]  Ask for George.
[00:54:04.702 --> 00:54:06.683]  Come, your master's at war.
[00:54:09.125 --> 00:54:11.126]  He'll build the big guns.
[00:54:13.467 --> 00:54:15.889]  He'll build the death planes.
[00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:19.711]  He'll build all the bombs.
[00:54:24.558 --> 00:54:30.101]  You know my biggest reason we're having portable foods and I've been so busy the last month I haven't ordered more like I've said on there I am.
[00:54:30.881 --> 00:54:38.426]  Even though I've got a two-year supply for two people, that's not enough.
[00:54:38.466 --> 00:54:46.031]  You want the freeze-dried, the type of stuff he's got, because it stores, it's smaller, it keeps the food quality, the nutritive qualities.
[00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:53.146]  My biggest reason is the economy, and food prices, and it's just an insurance policy, but you add all this other craziness to it.
[00:54:53.166 --> 00:54:56.107]  It's just the world gets crazier and crazier.
[00:54:56.127 --> 00:54:57.227]  1-800-409-5633.
[00:54:57.247 --> 00:55:01.369]  1-800-409-5633. eFoodsDirect.com if you missed that.
[00:55:02.629 --> 00:55:07.471]  Okay, I'm going to take a bunch of your calls right now, and in about 15 minutes we've got our guest coming on.
[00:55:07.991 --> 00:55:09.771]  Steve in Illinois, and then Yvette and others.
[00:55:09.791 --> 00:55:10.352]  Go ahead, Steve.
[00:55:11.032 --> 00:55:13.733]  Alex, you stand out like a clean, hard rock, and that's a buck.
[00:55:14.173 --> 00:55:14.633]  Well, thank you.
[00:55:16.932 --> 00:55:19.233]  You mentioned 18th century mind control.
[00:55:20.393 --> 00:55:34.320]  I don't want to belabor the point, but the Conformity Act was used by Walpole, who was the first Prime Minister of England, to control the churches and in turn the religious instruction.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:39.042]  I'll quote this out of the Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:55:39.082 --> 00:55:42.184]  The church's office supplied the poor, the illiterate,
[00:55:42.566 --> 00:55:46.489]  And particularly, old ladies, with the only political information available to them.
[00:55:46.929 --> 00:55:51.312]  Weekly in the Church of England, therefore, struck Walpole as unwise, for at least two reasons.
[00:55:51.332 --> 00:55:56.997]  It says, the minister has provided vital service to the state by communicating political instruction to the people.
[00:55:57.297 --> 00:56:04.282]  I won't go on, but my encyclopedia, Caledonia, strikes that and says, political indoctrination.
[00:56:04.582 --> 00:56:06.924]  They're using the pulpit as a hostage.
[00:56:07.444 --> 00:56:09.085]  And they're having these little old ladies,
[00:56:10.282 --> 00:56:13.204]  I'll spin these prayer wheels while they steal the balls off a brass monkey.
[00:56:13.624 --> 00:56:14.204]  But enough of that.
[00:56:14.445 --> 00:56:15.605]  You talked about the economy.
[00:56:16.126 --> 00:56:21.149]  In 1990, I was a member of the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, and I went to a lecture given by Helmut Schmidt.
[00:56:21.209 --> 00:56:21.989]  You know who he is.
[00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:26.092]  And he was mentioning in 1990 about the euro.
[00:56:26.873 --> 00:56:31.656]  He took a coin out of his pocket, and it was around Easter time, and he was talking about Jesus.
[00:56:32.056 --> 00:56:34.157]  Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and all this other stuff.
[00:56:34.217 --> 00:56:37.960]  And he says, you know, we're trying to get the Italians to change over from the lyrics 2,000 years old.
[00:56:38.956 --> 00:56:50.279]  But the point being, he stressed this in front of everybody there, and this is in 1990, he says, you Americans spend 103% of what you make, and the foreigners are financing your debt.
[00:56:50.539 --> 00:56:51.820]  This can't go on forever.
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.020]  Now that's, what, 17 years ago?
[00:56:54.241 --> 00:56:57.341]  Helmut Schmidt actually wrote that in his autobiography.
[00:56:58.142 --> 00:56:58.362]  Right.
[00:56:58.742 --> 00:57:05.844]  But what I'm saying is that this stuff here, it has the origin and the overconsumption and the presumptive arrogance
[00:57:06.512 --> 00:57:12.136]  of the people in this country who don't want to take responsibility or accountability when they manage their own money.
[00:57:12.316 --> 00:57:12.656]  Thank you.
[00:57:13.257 --> 00:57:13.897]  Thank you, sir.
[00:57:13.917 --> 00:57:14.958]  Good to have you call.
[00:57:15.458 --> 00:57:18.841]  Really, that's a great caller, making point after point after point.
[00:57:19.721 --> 00:57:22.963]  Let's go ahead and talk to a vet in New Jersey.
[00:57:22.983 --> 00:57:23.684]  You're on the air.
[00:57:24.584 --> 00:57:25.005]  Hello.
[00:57:25.125 --> 00:57:30.308]  I just wanted to share with everyone that the Ron Paul blimp needs $4,530 more dollars before midnight tonight.
[00:57:34.224 --> 00:57:42.856]  And that's a blimp that's going to fly around on the 16th coming up on the Money Bomb Day over Boston for the Boston Tea Party.
[00:57:43.396 --> 00:57:43.817]  Right.
[00:57:45.019 --> 00:57:46.561]  And I think it sounds great.
[00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:48.443]  It sounds like it'll help his campaign.
[00:57:48.463 --> 00:57:50.326]  He'll get a lot of coverage from the media.
[00:57:51.693 --> 00:57:52.073]  I agree.
[00:57:52.113 --> 00:57:55.314]  I'm going to commission another poll, and I'm going to need to get on this.
[00:57:55.374 --> 00:57:56.435]  I said I'd do this last week.
[00:57:56.475 --> 00:57:57.515]  Hire a couple airplanes.
[00:57:57.815 --> 00:57:59.476]  That's very inexpensive.
[00:57:59.496 --> 00:58:06.699]  You're talking $500 to $1,000 to fly around over Austin, and you can do it near your city with aircraft, saying RonPaul2008.com.
[00:58:07.619 --> 00:58:09.660]  But the blimp sounds really exciting.
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:11.561]  It should get a lot of media coverage and attention.
[00:58:12.061 --> 00:58:13.421]  I mean, it'll make a big splash.
[00:58:13.881 --> 00:58:16.602]  But for those with the smaller budgets, I would go with the airplanes.
[00:58:17.383 --> 00:58:17.743]  Okay.
[00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:19.851]  Hey, listen, thank you for the call.
[00:58:19.871 --> 00:58:21.252]  We're going to come back in the next hour.
[00:58:21.272 --> 00:58:23.733]  Dr. Chris, Michael, and Mark jam you guys in.
[00:58:23.773 --> 00:58:24.393]  Stand by.
[00:58:24.673 --> 00:58:26.234]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:26.814 --> 00:58:30.116]  Don't forget, End Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement and Loose Change Final Cut are out.
[00:58:30.656 --> 00:58:33.198]  And if you order them by the 16th, we'll ship them to you UPS.
[00:58:33.238 --> 00:58:35.059]  You'll get them before Christmas.

[00:59:10.609 --> 00:59:17.653]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

[00:59:37.736 --> 00:59:43.518]  Right now, let's talk to Chris in... Where is Chris calling from?
[00:59:43.618 --> 00:59:43.938]  Oregon?
[00:59:44.518 --> 00:59:45.959]  Yeah, you're... Arizona.
[00:59:45.999 --> 00:59:46.519]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:59:46.539 --> 00:59:47.019]  You're on air.
[00:59:47.039 --> 00:59:47.879]  Hi Alex.
[00:59:48.199 --> 00:59:48.459]  Hi.
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:52.040]  I came across a real interesting article this morning.
[00:59:52.721 --> 00:59:55.862]  Just a couple of points that it made.
[00:59:56.082 --> 00:59:56.562]  You know these
[00:59:58.306 --> 01:00:02.929]  Annual financial reports, these alternative funds that are off the books.
[01:00:02.949 --> 01:00:04.510]  Yeah, government's double set of books.
[01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:06.451]  Comprehensive annual financial reports.
[01:00:06.911 --> 01:00:24.042]  Well, Bloomberg this morning basically admitted that they existed, but not only that, they also stated that these polls were in trouble because they were invested so heavily in the subprime mortgages, and that
[01:00:24.977 --> 01:00:33.565]  If I could just read you a quick paragraph, it says, uh, news report from Bloomberg, Florida, just first to face national run on bank.
[01:00:34.847 --> 01:00:43.495]  State Board of Administration runs the poll, and then it lists the trustees, and it says the investment poll, which contained $27 billion this summer,
[01:00:43.996 --> 01:00:47.758]  Yeah, and they're saying basically that they're not going to be able to give these polls back.
[01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:09.150]  And so, you know... Wait a minute.
[01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:11.610]  You're saying they ordered the money back that's theirs.
[01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:13.531]  It's like they're cashing in on their investment.
[01:01:14.031 --> 01:01:14.131]  Right.
[01:01:14.151 --> 01:01:21.054]  And the... Now understand, for city, county, federal workers, don't let them tell you when this all implodes that...
[01:01:22.896 --> 01:01:24.657]  That the money's gone from your pension.
[01:01:25.398 --> 01:01:27.379]  Most of this is off-budget.
[01:01:27.399 --> 01:01:30.201]  This is like the mafia running two books.
[01:01:30.262 --> 01:01:31.262]  You don't even know about this.
[01:01:31.302 --> 01:01:41.370]  Your pension, all your investments, your county, city, water district, school district investments that finance your pensions and the rest of it, that's on budget.
[01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:42.791]  This is all cream.
[01:01:43.371 --> 01:01:43.691]  Go ahead.
[01:01:44.272 --> 01:01:49.396]  Yeah, so just to continue, because this article... What's the headline?
[01:01:52.796 --> 01:01:56.397]  Florida just first to face national run on the bank.
[01:01:56.938 --> 01:01:59.558]  Say that again, your phone's kind of... Yeah, sorry.
[01:02:00.019 --> 01:02:02.580]  Florida just first to face national run on the bank.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.840]  Florida just first, okay.
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:20.366]  Yeah, and it's Bloomberg reporting, but basically they're saying that it seems, well I'll just read you, it seems however that some of the commercial paper investments the Florida Poll and others like it across the country purchased were backed by some prime mortgages.
[01:02:21.215 --> 01:02:22.476]  Yeah, I've got the article.
[01:02:22.496 --> 01:02:23.597]  It's by Joe Misca.
[01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:37.010]  And it says what you're saying there.
[01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:44.392]  Yeah, the investment pool contained $27 billion in the summer, now $14 billion in the result of withdrawals from municipalities with keenly developed senses of self-preservation.
[01:02:44.812 --> 01:02:50.354]  On November 29th, the board told the remaining participants they couldn't withdraw any more money from the pool.
[01:02:50.854 --> 01:02:54.395]  Yeah, this looks like scaring total depression in the face.
[01:02:54.555 --> 01:02:57.755]  I ought to, frankly, run out of here right now and get my little bit of money out of the bank.
[01:02:58.216 --> 01:03:01.176]  I mean, this is just, this is getting to the, this is exactly what we said would happen.
[01:03:01.836 --> 01:03:03.537]  And it couldn't be any worse.
[01:03:05.653 --> 01:03:06.794]  I just don't know what to say anymore.
[01:03:07.055 --> 01:03:07.535]  What do you think?
[01:03:08.996 --> 01:03:17.103]  Well, I think that we're going to face a lot of difficulties in the future.
[01:03:17.263 --> 01:03:20.506]  And notice who the trustees are.
[01:03:21.126 --> 01:03:26.631]  Governor Charlie Crist, Financial Officer Alex Sink, and Attorney General Bill McComb.
[01:03:27.252 --> 01:03:29.293]  So you never hear about these things, but you're hearing about them now.
[01:03:29.333 --> 01:03:29.914]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:03:30.575 --> 01:03:31.436]  Yeah, it's better.
[01:03:32.697 --> 01:03:33.777]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[01:03:33.817 --> 01:03:34.938]  Thanks for bringing that to my attention.
[01:03:34.958 --> 01:03:37.580]  We need to get this posted on TruthNews.us.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:43.704]  We need Paul and folks to... You know, I'm going to bring this up with George Humphreys when he joins us coming up in the third hour.
[01:03:43.724 --> 01:03:51.289]  We're going to be talking all about finance in the third hour with a very respected economist.
[01:03:54.592 --> 01:03:55.992]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:57.073 --> 01:03:58.054]  A new world order.
[01:03:58.803 --> 01:04:03.026]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:05.827]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:04:06.528 --> 01:04:08.789]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:11.751]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:12.491 --> 01:04:19.856]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:22.831 --> 01:04:27.834]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:28.295 --> 01:04:31.577]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:31.597 --> 01:04:34.239]  The Bill of Rights has made great progress for the world.
[01:04:34.719 --> 01:04:35.860]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:36.640]  They're not after money.
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:37.721]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:38.682]  They're after power.
[01:04:38.942 --> 01:04:39.963]  That's what they're after.
[01:04:40.083 --> 01:04:48.288]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:48.428 --> 01:04:51.410]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:04:51.610 --> 01:04:52.631]  You have been warned.
[01:04:53.612 --> 01:04:53.932]  I think so.
[01:05:10.845 --> 01:05:12.346]  Your health is priceless.
[01:05:31.425 --> 01:05:32.065]  I think so.
[01:05:53.776 --> 01:05:55.617]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:05:55.757 --> 01:06:00.940]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.441]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:06:02.721 --> 01:06:10.886]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:06:11.106 --> 01:06:16.910]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:18.771]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:06:18.871 --> 01:06:20.972]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:06:21.152 --> 01:06:25.397]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:06:25.557 --> 01:06:27.700]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:35.548]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:06:36.209 --> 01:06:39.291]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:39.331 --> 01:06:41.172]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:07.293 --> 01:07:10.835]  He is with us for the next 52 minutes roughly.
[01:07:10.855 --> 01:07:15.218]  We'll be opening the phones up for others that are patiently holding.
[01:07:16.059 --> 01:07:22.423]  We will surely have to do a third interview with him to fully flesh all of this out.
[01:07:22.483 --> 01:07:28.067]  Economist George Humphrey joining us coming up in the third hour in studio.
[01:07:28.906 --> 01:07:34.389]  Right now is John Taylor Gatto, and we have links to him up on Infowars.com.
[01:07:34.469 --> 01:07:42.194]  His book that took him more than a decade to write, by the way, is free on his website, JohnTaylorGatto.com.
[01:07:42.274 --> 01:07:43.794]  Gatto spelled G-A-T-T-O.
[01:07:45.827 --> 01:07:55.432]  Let's just, in like five minutes, sir, and again I'm very honored to have you back on with us, recap how you woke up, who you are, the info you discovered, which by the way is extremely accurate, folks.
[01:07:55.452 --> 01:07:57.233]  My own research, I ran into all the same stuff.
[01:07:57.494 --> 01:07:58.514]  He just knows even more.
[01:07:58.534 --> 01:08:00.035]  This is his area of expertise.
[01:08:00.055 --> 01:08:01.676]  I want to tell you, this is documented.
[01:08:02.096 --> 01:08:07.379]  And then recap where all this started, where these ideas came from, recap what you covered last week.
[01:08:07.859 --> 01:08:11.681]  Well, Alex, it's a pleasure to be back with you, and let me see if I can be succinct.
[01:08:11.701 --> 01:08:12.762]  My wife says that it's impossible.
[01:08:12.802 --> 01:08:13.623]  Let me try.
[01:08:13.643 --> 01:08:13.763]  I did.
[01:08:13.783 --> 01:08:15.344]  I got quite a big response, and I would like to
[01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:37.033]  Thank you for
[01:08:54.921 --> 01:09:02.026]  Calls to send them the book, and that we don't do, but we do make it available to read on the website, or you can purchase it.
[01:09:02.266 --> 01:09:06.269]  No good deed goes unpunished.
[01:09:06.849 --> 01:09:08.050]  No, no, I understand.
[01:09:09.651 --> 01:09:16.976]  So go ahead and break down again for people that just joined us who you are, recap the history, and then let's go into the last hundred years and the future.
[01:09:17.557 --> 01:09:17.877]  Sure.
[01:09:19.827 --> 01:09:39.944]  A New York City public school teacher for 30 years and during that time I became the New York State Teacher of the Year twice named by different organizations and the New York City Teacher of the Year three times named by different organizations.
[01:09:40.845 --> 01:09:42.747]  Over that period of time
[01:09:43.949 --> 01:10:01.352]  As most people who teach or who parent and send their kids to public school, I kept running into immense contradictions and aspects of schooling that worked against the development of both mind and character.
[01:10:01.532 --> 01:10:09.734]  But when you're totally involved from morning to night in this, it becomes an immense nuisance and you blame
[01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:17.634]  You know, this guy or that guy, if we could just get rid of this stupid school administration and so on.
[01:10:17.694 --> 01:10:39.489]  Toward the end of my career, however, as I began to read into the history of schooling, and I don't mean in the standard histories because they won't take you where you need to go, I came to see that institutional schooling, which must never be mistaken for the
[01:10:40.242 --> 01:10:42.884]  Perfectly benign term education.
[01:10:42.964 --> 01:10:47.467]  It's not intended to be an education, quite the reverse.
[01:10:47.947 --> 01:11:03.178]  Anyway, I came to see that institutional schooling had some very specific functions, none of which were discussed, and that it got rid of people who didn't play ball.
[01:11:03.238 --> 01:11:09.082]  Now, you might say, well, you just said that they actually aren't aware of what they're doing.
[01:11:09.122 --> 01:11:09.963]  That's correct.
[01:11:10.506 --> 01:11:29.377]  But if being unaware and doing your job as a daily school teacher, or as a school principal, or as a school superintendent, you invoke principle or morality, and in doing so you threaten to untrack this train, you're gotten rid of.
[01:11:29.477 --> 01:11:31.278]  It's just that simple.
[01:11:31.738 --> 01:11:35.381]  This is a utopian institution.
[01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:44.495]  If we were speaking theologically, I'd say it's an evil institution, but let me keep it on the philosophical grounds.
[01:11:44.895 --> 01:12:01.626]  This is a utopian institution meant to deliver the management of small societies and a global society into the right hands, and to keep it there, and to protect it against argument.
[01:12:02.066 --> 01:12:04.248]  Now, your listeners in particular, Alex,
[01:12:04.733 --> 01:12:21.942]  would be aware that this is wildly, radically unconstitutional, where the idea is to deliver finally the direction of the society into the hands of the people, of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[01:12:22.843 --> 01:12:32.908]  This was our wonderfully novel gift to the planet and out of it we became very, very prosperous, very, very powerful,
[01:12:34.143 --> 01:12:38.748]  And I would say, as human life can be reckoned, very happy.
[01:12:39.068 --> 01:12:58.167]  And by the way, going back over 150 years ago, public books were written, top educators came right out and said the public's too smart, the official banking associations said we've got a finance education, too many people can read, John Dewey said that it was a crime to teach children how to read.
[01:12:58.787 --> 01:13:06.233]  Obviously, to convert a libertarian nation where the goal, where the American dream was to write your own script, have your own little business, in order to do that,
[01:13:28.226 --> 01:13:49.035]  You had to either run into a wall of deadly opposition or you had to cajole the public into surrendering their children into a new type of institutional schooling that would take them far and fast and be free.
[01:13:49.615 --> 01:13:56.418]  Of course, once the children are surrendered, the transition doesn't take place immediately
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:04.966]  Alex, in the first generation, what you've done is weakened these libertarian impulses.
[01:14:05.046 --> 01:14:08.189]  In the second generation, you severely weakened them.
[01:14:08.749 --> 01:14:19.597]  And by our day, which is now the fourth or fifth generation, they don't even exist except as radical ideas that we have to stay away from.
[01:14:19.617 --> 01:14:25.582]  Why should a parent have any say at all in how their child is reared?
[01:14:26.221 --> 01:14:45.866]  It's true, they risk their life and their pocketbook having that child, but at that point, the child becomes the property of the political state and the people who manage the political state, who in our epoch, Alex, are global corporations.
[01:14:45.966 --> 01:14:54.168]  And it was the early global corporations, in particular the Carnegie Group of Corporations,
[01:14:55.396 --> 01:15:00.029]  The Rockefeller Group of Corporations, which of course included Standard Oil.
[01:15:00.911 --> 01:15:13.943]  And I would say another dozen or two dozen extremely wealthy people who thought globally like Vincent and... And by the way, just type into Google John Dewey quotes or John Dewey New World Order.
[01:15:13.963 --> 01:15:15.525]  You'll find university websites.
[01:15:16.526 --> 01:15:25.414]  To the American Education Fellowship, formerly the Progressive Education Association, organized by John Dewey, he called for, quote, establishment of a genuine world order, an order which is
[01:15:26.114 --> 01:15:29.077]  Where national sovereignty is subordinate to world authority.
[01:15:29.537 --> 01:15:33.240]  And then there's more quotes about how we should teach people not to be able to read.
[01:15:33.721 --> 01:15:37.264]  And then this guy's praised and worshipped, just like Margaret Sanger, the eugenicist.
[01:15:37.444 --> 01:15:37.844]  Yes, he is.
[01:15:37.964 --> 01:15:43.889]  I mean, the public... I mean, because last time we covered the early stuff in the Prussians, where it came from, and how it metastasized.
[01:15:43.929 --> 01:15:46.151]  I want to get into these guys, but please continue.
[01:15:47.712 --> 01:15:51.996]  Well, of course, the fund of available
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:16:01.464]  ideas and utopian ideas isn't endless and we drew almost directly from the Prussian experience.
[01:16:01.564 --> 01:16:06.106]  Prussia was a little military state up against the North Sea.
[01:16:06.446 --> 01:16:08.567]  They were wildly successful.
[01:16:09.107 --> 01:16:15.370]  About half the people who fought in the American Revolution were on both sides.
[01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:19.692]  Were either hired Prussians, hired Saxons, hired
[01:16:20.106 --> 01:16:26.511]  Hanoverians, but we called them all Prussians, because that was the tail that wagged the military dog.
[01:16:27.092 --> 01:16:34.798]  Prussia had been the site of the... This just fascinates me, and I hope your readers will be interested.
[01:16:35.499 --> 01:16:46.328]  Prussia was the result of the Fourth Crusade, the one that's never talked about, in which the Pope dispatched armies to Northern Europe
[01:16:46.863 --> 01:16:50.785]  to conquer the wild tribes up against the North Sea.
[01:16:51.145 --> 01:16:57.668]  So for the first 300 years of its existence, it was, in fact, a theocracy.
[01:16:57.688 --> 01:17:00.789]  It was a military religious state.
[01:17:01.129 --> 01:17:11.094]  As time passed, the religious part was pushed to the fringes and the rational military part that the strong or superior
[01:17:12.186 --> 01:17:13.266]  came to the fore.
[01:17:13.406 --> 01:17:28.291]  Prussia was studied by every major nation on earth, including Japan, and the societies were, to a greater or lesser extent, reconfigured to match what Prussia did.
[01:17:28.611 --> 01:17:36.253]  The traditional liberty in the United States was so strong that you couldn't use candid language.
[01:17:36.593 --> 01:17:39.214]  This had to be done by chipping away
[01:17:39.625 --> 01:17:39.925]  Thank you.
[01:17:48.613 --> 01:18:04.918]  And they phased this in, and they all wrote best-selling books on how they were doing it, on how they hated it, on how we were scum, and then, ha-ha, we'll tell them you'd look at a word to learn how to read it instead of sounding it out, ha-ha-ha, this will screw them up.
[01:18:05.199 --> 01:18:08.300]  Well, Dewey really laid the law down.
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:12.501]  He said, as long as people know how to read well,
[01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.590]  I'm
[01:18:31.876 --> 01:18:36.717]  The thing to do is to remove the pleasure in reading and the ability to do it.
[01:18:36.798 --> 01:18:41.519]  Oddly enough, if you enjoy reading, it's basically self-teaching.
[01:18:41.559 --> 01:18:48.421]  It's a lot of hard work to read difficult stuff, but people who like to read eventually teach themselves.
[01:18:48.441 --> 01:18:49.141]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:18:49.161 --> 01:18:49.581]  Stay there.
[01:18:49.601 --> 01:18:52.342]  We're talking about these absolute enemies of freedom.
[01:18:54.517 --> 01:18:58.418]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:18:58.619 --> 01:19:10.903]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:19:11.323 --> 01:19:11.723]  The U.S.
[01:19:11.783 --> 01:19:17.365]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:19:17.766 --> 01:19:19.966]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:19:21.827 --> 01:19:22.888]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:19:22.928 --> 01:19:25.769]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:19:25.889 --> 01:19:31.911]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:19:32.331 --> 01:19:35.692]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:19:35.772 --> 01:19:42.115]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:19:42.675 --> 01:19:46.678]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:19:46.798 --> 01:19:46.978]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:46.998 --> 01:19:47.218]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:54.187 --> 01:19:55.868]  Do you need an easier way to stay in touch?
[01:19:56.148 --> 01:19:57.829]  A two-way radio may be for you.
[01:19:58.029 --> 01:20:02.050]  Two-way radios provide short-range communication with no recurring service charges.
[01:20:02.250 --> 01:20:05.292]  Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and skiing.
[01:20:05.452 --> 01:20:09.293]  Great for amusement parks, cruises, or just keeping up with the kids around the neighborhood.
[01:20:09.434 --> 01:20:11.835]  Two-way radios can also make your business more efficient.
[01:20:11.955 --> 01:20:15.216]  Cut costs while increasing productivity in doctor and dental offices.
[01:20:15.316 --> 01:20:15.576]  I think so.
[01:20:31.129 --> 01:20:31.790]  We're good to go.
[01:20:55.203 --> 01:21:04.290]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:21:04.531 --> 01:21:15.760]  Black Flurky elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:20.924]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:21:21.144 --> 01:21:21.304]  I think?
[01:21:40.111 --> 01:21:41.293]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[01:21:41.353 --> 01:21:42.194]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[01:21:42.234 --> 01:21:42.474]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:21:42.555 --> 01:21:44.257]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:21:54.073 --> 01:21:55.735]  You wear a seatbelt in your car.
[01:21:55.995 --> 01:21:57.296]  At home, you lock the doors.
[01:21:57.577 --> 01:21:59.298]  How about when you use your cell phone?
[01:21:59.499 --> 01:22:00.660]  How do you protect yourself?
[01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:06.606]  EMFs, or electromagnetic frequencies, act like an invisible pollution that surrounds us every day.
[01:22:06.826 --> 01:22:14.053]  Studies link EMFs to many ailments, from stress to depression, anxiety, decreased mental performance, lower immune system,
[01:22:14.073 --> 01:22:14.353]  I think?
[01:22:33.493 --> 01:22:34.173]  We're good to go.
[01:23:18.072 --> 01:23:21.773]  Everybody knows that the system wants to dumb us down.
[01:23:21.793 --> 01:23:24.773]  You know, George Carlin, some of his most famous jokes are about it.
[01:23:25.314 --> 01:23:27.014]  He says, hey, the rich people want you dumb.
[01:23:27.494 --> 01:23:28.334]  It's by design.
[01:23:29.454 --> 01:23:32.115]  But to actually, I've probably only read
[01:23:33.459 --> 01:23:40.241]  Fifteen books by these educators, but I've read hundreds of their quotes, tracked back that it indeed was in speeches they gave or in magazines.
[01:23:40.902 --> 01:23:43.943]  And they just talk about us as absolute scum who need to be dumbed down.
[01:23:44.283 --> 01:23:46.744]  We have to be dumbed down so they can carry out eugenics against us.
[01:23:47.424 --> 01:23:49.385]  Dewey, all of them were eugenicists as well.
[01:23:49.985 --> 01:23:56.227]  The Fabian socialist Bertrand Russell pushed all this and all these fools send me emails going, but he was a nice guy, look he said all this.
[01:23:56.587 --> 01:23:59.348]  He wrote elite publications and he wrote public publications.
[01:24:00.166 --> 01:24:00.526]  Okay?
[01:24:00.927 --> 01:24:03.269]  You know, calling black people inferior and all the rest of it.
[01:24:03.309 --> 01:24:09.774]  I'm not going to go along with you because you think Dewey's a hero, Sanger's a hero, or Bertrand Russell's a hero.
[01:24:09.814 --> 01:24:10.695]  They're monsters.
[01:24:11.155 --> 01:24:12.496]  I own their books.
[01:24:13.217 --> 01:24:15.018]  I've read what they say.
[01:24:15.659 --> 01:24:17.720]  You have heard the PR the media puts out.
[01:24:18.041 --> 01:24:29.550]  Mr. Gatto, what is it like for you, you know, school teacher of the year, before that a big, you know, PR guy, ad man, so you could, you know, recognize this stuff, to learn that it was all by design,
[01:24:30.536 --> 01:24:37.942]  And to learn that the biggest money people, openly, for over a hundred years, have been incrementally, in phases, dumbing us down.
[01:24:38.723 --> 01:24:41.425]  And, I mean, for the public listening, this is an open conspiracy.
[01:24:41.786 --> 01:24:46.209]  This is an absolute fact to dumb you down, and then progressively dumb your children down.
[01:24:46.249 --> 01:24:46.409]  Sir?
[01:24:46.429 --> 01:24:49.212]  In fact, H.G.
[01:24:49.292 --> 01:24:50.613]  Wells, and I believe 1919 wrote,
[01:24:52.881 --> 01:24:59.986]  A wonderful essay, I wonderful in quotation marks, that exists today called The Open Conspiracy.
[01:25:00.826 --> 01:25:03.328]  I'm sure that you could access that on the web.
[01:25:03.608 --> 01:25:05.649]  And by the way, Milt Gatto, here's the funny thing.
[01:25:05.709 --> 01:25:11.093]  I had a guest on last hour talking about the Rockefeller Foundation trying to push a radiating of everything and GMO.
[01:25:11.893 --> 01:25:12.633]  I have you on.
[01:25:12.673 --> 01:25:14.855]  Rockefeller, Carnegie Foundation, Education.
[01:25:14.895 --> 01:25:23.378]  They're masters at setting the blueprints for societies, then they set the mapmakers of the mind system, and then we all conform to it.
[01:25:23.679 --> 01:25:25.780]  I mean, literally, it doesn't matter who I have on.
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.320]  Congressmen, it never ends.
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:28.581]  It always goes back to them.
[01:25:29.381 --> 01:25:29.922]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:25:29.962 --> 01:25:32.883]  I mean, it's like they're Lax Luther or the Legion of Doom or something.
[01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:44.600]  Yeah, obviously whoever puts together this form of social machine has to be extremely sophisticated.
[01:25:45.041 --> 01:25:49.164]  They have to understand how humans respond.
[01:25:49.265 --> 01:25:56.111]  For example, there are millions of people involved in official schooling
[01:25:56.816 --> 01:26:06.238]  I have no exact count, but if more than a hundred of those people are aware of what you and I are talking about, I would drop dead.
[01:26:06.698 --> 01:26:17.019]  The way the system's set up that employees on any level, including the high levels in the state ed departments, exist.
[01:26:17.119 --> 01:26:20.800]  Their safety depends on not rocking the boat.
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.360]  And it's all compartmentalized.
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:25.921]  It's compartmentalized to divide and conquer.
[01:26:26.403 --> 01:26:30.625]  Yeah, and that principle goes back to Julius Caesar.
[01:26:30.645 --> 01:26:34.306]  That was taught in colleges in the 5th century.
[01:26:34.326 --> 01:26:35.307]  Battle for gold!
[01:26:35.847 --> 01:26:37.388]  How you do that, yeah.
[01:26:37.648 --> 01:26:46.291]  Well, sure, when I was in 7th grade, that was in 1943, we read, not parts of it, we read Julius Caesar's
[01:26:51.114 --> 01:26:51.615]  I don't
[01:27:07.347 --> 01:27:18.099]  Some took that choice, some didn't take that choice, but that would give you some measure of how the decline has been managed.
[01:27:18.319 --> 01:27:21.503]  That's a graduate level course now for a Ph.D.
[01:27:22.144 --> 01:27:23.745]  Seventh grade, Alex!
[01:27:24.166 --> 01:27:28.691]  And I know that they're perfectly intelligent listeners who are saying, well why should anyone
[01:27:29.255 --> 01:27:34.278]  bother to read an ancient piece of an ancient essay?
[01:27:34.658 --> 01:27:45.005]  And the answer is simply this, not to learn about ancient Rome, it's a workbook on how you divide and conquer people you want to overwhelm.
[01:27:45.605 --> 01:27:47.927]  Caesar only had 10,000 troops.
[01:27:48.367 --> 01:27:51.849]  The Gauls were quite brave, and they had half a million troops.
[01:27:52.309 --> 01:27:53.830]  He was outnumbered 50 to 1, but by
[01:27:55.572 --> 01:27:55.993]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:27:56.113 --> 01:27:56.593]  Absolutely.
[01:27:56.653 --> 01:27:58.856]  Identical because some of these principles become timeless.
[01:27:58.976 --> 01:28:00.258]  They're passed down among
[01:28:13.777 --> 01:28:16.940]  Uh... groups that maintain power, that manage things.
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:19.222]  Stay there, quick break, long segment coming up.
[01:28:19.282 --> 01:28:24.588]  I want to get into the 20th century and the 21st, where this is going and how we turn it around.
[01:28:25.208 --> 01:28:31.554]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, they write hundreds of books about how they hate you, how they're going to dumb you down and take your lunch.
[01:28:32.175 --> 01:28:32.535]  Okay?
[01:28:32.755 --> 01:28:33.756]  They are your enemy.
[01:28:34.197 --> 01:28:35.438]  They are the New World Order.
[01:28:44.301 --> 01:28:47.305]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.227 --> 01:28:50.931]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.318 --> 01:28:56.439]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[01:28:56.799 --> 01:28:59.860]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:04.682]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:29:05.062 --> 01:29:07.683]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:29:08.143 --> 01:29:14.886]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:29:15.346 --> 01:29:20.589]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:29:21.029 --> 01:29:22.670]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:29:23.190 --> 01:29:26.471]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:29:27.012 --> 01:29:30.393]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[01:29:30.453 --> 01:29:37.076]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[01:29:37.777 --> 01:29:40.898]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings,
[01:29:41.018 --> 01:29:41.358]  We're good.
[01:29:54.013 --> 01:29:58.255]  The holidays are here, and that means extra food and extra weight gain.
[01:29:58.415 --> 01:30:00.955]  Why not make your New Year's resolution seem healthier?
[01:30:01.156 --> 01:30:05.897]  And the easiest and most delicious way to start is with your new Excalibur Dehydrator.
[01:30:05.917 --> 01:30:10.099]  The Excalibur Dehydrator makes eating healthy not only easy, but fun.
[01:30:10.219 --> 01:30:13.520]  You can use it with your favorite fruit, vegetables, fish, and meat.

[01:30:19.767 --> 01:30:25.614]  You can also use the Excalibur Dehydrator to make your own herbs and spices in the comfort of your own kitchen.
[01:30:25.754 --> 01:30:27.977]  It's so easy your whole family can use it.
[01:30:28.157 --> 01:30:32.022]  Oh, and don't forget, the Excalibur Dehydrator makes the perfect Christmas gift.

[01:30:55.063 --> 01:31:04.729]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism, comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[01:31:04.749 --> 01:31:06.330]  The whole country's on a bus.
[01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:07.631]  A crazy driver.
[01:31:08.031 --> 01:31:11.553]  If the passengers can't get hold of the wheel, we're all gonna go over the cliff.
[01:31:11.694 --> 01:31:13.975]  GCN brings you Uncivil Liberties.
[01:31:14.155 --> 01:31:16.216]  A movie the government does not want you to see.
[01:31:16.316 --> 01:31:18.818]  A political thriller ripped from today's headlines.
[01:31:18.918 --> 01:31:21.880]  Domestic spying, wiretapping, government shipping and more.
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:24.982]  The government's gonna know where everybody's ass is every minute of the day and night.
[01:31:25.102 --> 01:31:32.548]  For your copy of this hard-hitting film that will open your eyes, go to uncivilliberties.com to receive your full-length feature on DVD.
[01:31:32.608 --> 01:31:36.471]  Normally $30, special promotion for GCN listeners for only $13.95.
[01:31:36.551 --> 01:31:40.635]  That's uncivilliberties.com to view the movie trailer.
[01:31:41.015 --> 01:31:45.138]  Social engineering to turn you into dumb, down, mindless fools who can't even understand basic language, basic semantic symbols.
[01:32:12.119 --> 01:32:12.879]  It's real simple.
[01:32:13.219 --> 01:32:37.484]  They had training manuals going back at least 500 years ago, translated out of Spanish and Portuguese from the different sugar cane plantations in the Caribbean, on how to dumb down the African slaves they brought in, how to keep them from learning how to read, write, how to bring the women in to the houses and train them as the supervisors of the men.
[01:32:39.569 --> 01:32:41.091]  We're good to go.
[01:33:04.302 --> 01:33:17.027]  The Austrians, as they went into Gaul, against the next group of Gauls, against the next group of Gauls, doing that systematically, all the forms of manipulation, and this is two thousand sixty-something years old.
[01:33:17.608 --> 01:33:31.393]  This is the type of material... There's nothing worse for me than to know I'm telling you the truth, to know I've got their manuals, to know it's all public, but again, maybe five percent of the country actually reads more than one book a year,
[01:33:32.701 --> 01:33:37.684]  It used to be half the country were avid readers or more, and everybody read newspapers or tried, 95%.
[01:33:38.604 --> 01:33:40.625]  They have destroyed us.
[01:33:41.986 --> 01:33:44.748]  And I just want you to see endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:33:44.968 --> 01:33:49.410]  I mean, it's them openly setting up the Euro, openly setting up the North American Union.
[01:33:50.511 --> 01:33:52.111]  They're going to totally implode the economy.
[01:33:52.412 --> 01:34:00.656]  They're going to take everything you've got, open police state, open martial law, open dictatorship of this system, all candy-coated.
[01:34:01.441 --> 01:34:03.986]  And people need to see Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:34:04.548 --> 01:34:06.252]  You need to give it to everybody you know for Christmas.
[01:34:06.292 --> 01:34:06.853]  You don't want to wait.
[01:34:06.873 --> 01:34:08.697]  If you can only afford one copy, buy one copy.
[01:34:09.118 --> 01:34:11.544]  Make copies of the DVD on DVD Burner.
[01:34:12.427 --> 01:34:13.228]  I have to keep myself every day
[01:34:35.089 --> 01:34:41.871]  From getting depressed or getting enraged as I read more books, more documents, more official Department of Education documents.
[01:34:42.351 --> 01:34:44.552]  I mean, it's just unbelievable criminals!
[01:34:45.312 --> 01:34:51.674]  They're just actually writing about how they've dumbed us down and how we're slaves and laughing at us that we'll never figure it out.
[01:34:54.393 --> 01:34:55.014]  We can.
[01:34:55.134 --> 01:34:56.134]  People are waking up.
[01:34:56.234 --> 01:35:00.297]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:00.677 --> 01:35:02.278]  We have a deal just for the month of December.
[01:35:02.438 --> 01:35:05.080]  Five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:05.761]  Go check that out.
[01:35:05.821 --> 01:35:09.863]  Five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv with thousands of pieces of media up there.
[01:35:10.284 --> 01:35:11.684]  An armory of InfoWars.
[01:35:12.365 --> 01:35:15.027]  Or write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:35:19.409 --> 01:35:21.592]  Go to John Taylor Gatto's website.
[01:35:22.133 --> 01:35:23.054]  He wrote a book.
[01:35:23.074 --> 01:35:27.400]  You can buy a hard copy if you want, but it's up there for free to download.
[01:35:28.662 --> 01:35:33.048]  And go there, read it, give it to people.
[01:35:34.029 --> 01:35:35.230]  I know it's hard for you to read.
[01:35:35.250 --> 01:35:37.853]  I know TV's on and you're not trained to do it.
[01:35:37.953 --> 01:35:39.134]  Once you start reading, it's addictive.
[01:35:39.954 --> 01:35:41.035]  And then don't believe Gatto.
[01:35:41.456 --> 01:35:46.800]  Take a quote he's got, Google it, you'll find university official sites, you'll find the books written by these people.
[01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:47.721]  Don't believe that.
[01:35:47.861 --> 01:35:48.442]  Order the book.
[01:35:48.862 --> 01:35:59.471]  Physically get books where all the icons of our age are calling us slaves and scum and how they've dumbed us down and how they're gonna have their way with us and how they're gonna sterilize us and how they're gonna... Okay?
[01:35:59.952 --> 01:36:00.252]  Okay?
[01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:02.470]  Go to his website.
[01:36:02.831 --> 01:36:03.611]  It's free!
[01:36:04.151 --> 01:36:06.192]  Over a decade of his research, free!
[01:36:08.492 --> 01:36:12.473]  Go to Google Video, watch Endgame for free, but it's better to have the high-quality DVD and give it to folks.
[01:36:13.914 --> 01:36:14.774]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up.
[01:36:15.214 --> 01:36:24.317]  What really needs to be done is for everybody to get really aggressive and educate everybody, and go to whatistheendgame.com, whatistheendgame.com.
[01:36:25.037 --> 01:36:27.858]  We now have more than two-thirds of the film bibliographed,
[01:36:28.662 --> 01:36:29.142]  I think so.
[01:36:48.024 --> 01:36:54.730]  I mean, there's nothing worse than knowing they're doing this, and knowing the public's now awake, we're being calm, but the public doesn't know all the specifics.
[01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:56.512]  Okay, I'm literally going to turn my mic off.
[01:36:56.953 --> 01:37:03.138]  Get into the 20th century, 21st century, specifically what they've done, what the plan is, the phases.
[01:37:03.158 --> 01:37:03.799]  You've got the floor.
[01:37:03.819 --> 01:37:10.585]  Okay, I think it'll be useful for your listeners to frame this
[01:37:11.804 --> 01:37:17.006]  This project, this argument that we're entering, and you're quite right.
[01:37:17.306 --> 01:37:24.988]  Simply by spreading this around, simply by doing that, you will grind this thing to a halt.
[01:37:25.228 --> 01:37:32.670]  It depends upon your cooperation to be your own jailer and your own saboteur.
[01:37:33.951 --> 01:37:38.654]  And that information, oddly enough, is at least 500 years ago.
[01:37:38.714 --> 01:37:46.559]  In John Calvin's Institutes, he said the damned comprise 95% of the population.
[01:37:47.439 --> 01:37:51.842]  And there are too many of them for us to cow.
[01:37:52.542 --> 01:37:56.564]  What we have to do is train them to be their own jailers.
[01:37:56.685 --> 01:38:02.528]  Indeed, Calvin has the first clear idea of how an institutional
[01:38:03.101 --> 01:38:04.322]  School would work.
[01:38:04.402 --> 01:38:09.024]  And then there's a line all the way down through Charles Darwin.
[01:38:09.124 --> 01:38:13.347]  The book you want to read is not Origin of Species, but Descent of Man.
[01:38:13.967 --> 01:38:23.512]  And you'll see clearly that 95% of the population are biologically so degraded, there's nothing can be done for them.
[01:38:24.105 --> 01:38:30.346]  So that now these people who are operating this project have a moral foundation to stand on.
[01:38:30.726 --> 01:38:35.287]  They're only helping the progress of, you know, nature.
[01:38:35.787 --> 01:38:50.030]  Anyway, what happens, and it happens in stages, and I'm going to have to leapfrog some of these stages in the short time we have together to leave behind stuff that's traceable.
[01:38:50.450 --> 01:38:51.850]  The great change
[01:38:52.671 --> 01:39:03.379]  And the great change happens in stages, but the great change that all the people listening are living through happens right after the Second World War.
[01:39:03.899 --> 01:39:14.306]  For the very first time, all the nations of the world that we compete with have had their industrial capacity broken.
[01:39:15.027 --> 01:39:21.131]  And so the wealth that flows into the United States is so intoxicating
[01:39:21.881 --> 01:39:46.257]  And leaks down even into the lowest levels of labor that you can seduce the population who are now running around saying, wow, we're rich or relatively rich, into accepting compulsion schooling as the key to distributing opportunity.
[01:39:46.397 --> 01:39:49.399]  Now, oddly enough, there's no connection
[01:39:49.901 --> 01:40:03.670]  Between your standardized test score and your success in life, none has ever been demonstrated, although billions of dollars are spent trying to show that there's such a correlation.
[01:40:04.050 --> 01:40:13.616]  It's simply not true, and none of our national leaders have anything but undistinguished school careers.
[01:40:13.676 --> 01:40:18.259]  That includes Republicans, Democrats, and outsiders.
[01:40:19.689 --> 01:40:31.199]  For the most part, they're C students, but Al Gore, for example, flunked out of his first college, and our current vice president flunked out of college twice.
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:46.933]  George Bush, who's roundly considered what I do believe him to be as a very dull mind, actually had a better college average than the fellow he ran against, the snooty guy, Kerry, from Boston.
[01:40:47.871 --> 01:40:59.238]  So we're talking about a fantasy that's been laid down in such a complex fashion and so deeply that it's very hard to penetrate.
[01:40:59.558 --> 01:41:04.521]  And now here comes the principle that I hope your readers will remember.
[01:41:04.941 --> 01:41:13.186]  Of all the people involved in this, almost none of them understand what they're involved in.
[01:41:13.246 --> 01:41:15.107]  And that's why Alex's advice
[01:41:15.583 --> 01:41:17.184]  to spread this around.
[01:41:17.304 --> 01:41:23.047]  It even works on some of the villains who don't know what they're involved in.
[01:41:24.208 --> 01:41:42.738]  But nevertheless, the Carnegie, the Rockefeller, the Astor, the Vanderbilt, the Harriman, the brain trust that gave us this had something more than simply a desire to be
[01:41:43.951 --> 01:41:44.612]  Wealthier.
[01:41:44.972 --> 01:41:47.934]  They already were as wealthy as it was possible to be.
[01:41:47.994 --> 01:41:49.595]  Nobody has enough imagination.
[01:41:49.615 --> 01:41:51.276]  They're all eugenicists to a man.
[01:41:51.296 --> 01:41:52.977]  And I've got to go back to something you said five minutes ago.
[01:41:52.997 --> 01:41:53.918]  I've been biting my tongue.
[01:41:54.899 --> 01:42:03.204]  We talked about how it was the moral base that we've got to kill, disease, dumb down 90% because they're all damned.
[01:42:04.145 --> 01:42:07.127]  Calvin was just saying what the British lords already believed.
[01:42:08.148 --> 01:42:10.069]  Just like Darwin was and Galton.
[01:42:10.549 --> 01:42:11.210]  It fits in
[01:42:12.236 --> 01:42:22.628]  To the attitude they already had, and then just like last year, the head of the state board was being questioned before the legislature by Representative Susanna Hupp.
[01:42:22.648 --> 01:42:23.729]  We have the video in Endgame.
[01:42:24.209 --> 01:42:27.833]  And she says, why are two-thirds plus of the foster kids on psychotropic drugs?
[01:42:28.494 --> 01:42:30.576]  Why are they on a bunch of drugs on average?
[01:42:30.596 --> 01:42:31.077]  And he said,
[01:42:31.869 --> 01:42:34.470]  Well, because they're bad gene pool, bad genetics.
[01:42:35.010 --> 01:42:42.713]  You see, there's no genetic test, they're just waging war, and it's literally a scientific dictatorship.
[01:42:42.753 --> 01:42:43.073]  Go ahead.
[01:42:43.593 --> 01:42:55.136]  Well, if your listeners will understand that the real power generating this thing, it's a substitute religion.
[01:42:55.677 --> 01:42:58.978]  These people don't need money, and they don't need status.
[01:43:00.330 --> 01:43:09.997]  They're following some kind of philosophical, religious ideal, and that's where the... It's the control freak religions, is what I call it.
[01:43:10.017 --> 01:43:10.417]  Okay.
[01:43:10.777 --> 01:43:12.699]  But it's where the zeal comes from.
[01:43:13.199 --> 01:43:26.448]  So that you're wasting your breath if you think you can sit down with the superior argument, show evidence for the rightness of your argument, and people say, oh, wow, yeah, we were doing it wrong.
[01:43:26.708 --> 01:43:27.849]  No, that won't happen.
[01:43:28.502 --> 01:43:41.830]  The idea is to set aside 95% of the human race and to turn them into, I'm sure you've heard this term over and over again, human resources.
[01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:50.114]  In what sense is a human life with a sovereign spirit a human resource?
[01:43:50.235 --> 01:43:50.915]  It's zombies!
[01:43:51.675 --> 01:43:52.576]  It really is!
[01:43:52.656 --> 01:43:54.157]  They're human resources.
[01:43:55.170 --> 01:43:55.930]  I presume.
[01:43:56.551 --> 01:44:20.360]  In any case, so what we have here are a group of passionate ideologues at the end of the 19th century, so we'll bring this right up to the present, and we have a large number of people who follow what we all understand to be human nature, that it can be seduced by greed and the promise of, you know, more than your share.
[01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:24.422]  So the Rockefellers and the Carnegie's
[01:44:25.021 --> 01:44:33.348]  Have the zeal, but what have they promised the other powerful people to fall in line here?
[01:44:33.468 --> 01:44:38.011]  They don't talk about this as a philosophic ideal at all.
[01:44:38.352 --> 01:44:41.114]  They talk about efficiency.
[01:44:41.838 --> 01:44:46.200]  And if you look, again, the Internet is a blessing in this regard.
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:55.343]  Between 1890 and 1925, when this thing was being set up, when institutional schooling was being set up,
[01:44:56.132 --> 01:45:01.834]  The commonest term in business circles is scientific management.
[01:45:02.254 --> 01:45:05.335]  That's measured by efficiency.
[01:45:05.435 --> 01:45:07.116]  Well, what is efficiency?
[01:45:07.616 --> 01:45:23.662]  Well, if you know Frederick Taylor's time and motion studies, where somebody stands and watches you move your hand at a machine for several days and then the orders come down, move your hand this way.
[01:45:24.190 --> 01:45:31.056]  Turn your head this way, that's almost a parody of what scientific efficiency is.
[01:45:31.557 --> 01:45:33.859]  It's turning people into machines.
[01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:49.993]  But more than that, the Rockefellers and Carnegie's write in their secret eugenics, because the public view is negative and positive eugenics, killing the infirm, energizing and breeding the elites for supermen, but they actually state that's not really the plan.
[01:45:51.517 --> 01:46:01.459]  The plan is to dumb down the middle class and knock out competition and freeze any new renaissance from happening or new elites emerging.
[01:46:01.539 --> 01:46:07.001]  So it's monopoly men doing what they do, dumbing down the mass so that no one can ever rise against them.
[01:46:07.481 --> 01:46:20.644]  It's lovely that you say that, because if you trace the major documents, the immortal ones that are taught in every good college in the United States, but taught as a good thing, not a bad thing,
[01:46:21.564 --> 01:46:29.109]  You find that the destruction of the common imagination is at the center of the thing.
[01:46:29.589 --> 01:46:50.181]  Yes, they can take police and an army and lock you up or deprive you of food or crack the whip, but throughout history that has never worked for very long and every government that's used that as their control technique has been toppled sooner or later.
[01:46:50.914 --> 01:46:55.676]  So, what has to be done is a good deal subtler than that.
[01:46:55.996 --> 01:47:06.059]  You have to make people their own prisoners, and you have to remove their imagination so they can't think of anything different to do.
[01:47:06.999 --> 01:47:11.000]  And, oh, Alex, if I could just... Well, whatever.
[01:47:12.301 --> 01:47:19.903]  The number of people on the highest levels of intellectual society who have said exactly what I just said
[01:47:20.419 --> 01:47:20.979]  I don't know.
[01:47:36.391 --> 01:47:43.878]  What happens is when you watch television, you are passive and it doesn't cause complex imaginary processes in the mind.
[01:47:44.158 --> 01:47:48.943]  When you listen to radio or read, you have to image everything you're hearing.
[01:47:50.044 --> 01:47:54.268]  And so that increases cognitive ability and neuron connections.
[01:47:54.908 --> 01:48:10.485]  And that's why there's huge causal connections to Alzheimer's and old folks that watch a lot of television versus some composer whose brain they cut open when they die and it's a tiny shriveled thing at 90 years old but the person was a genius bouncing off the walls when they died.
[01:48:10.965 --> 01:48:30.569]  It isn't even that the brain mass starts dying at age 30, it's that you have all this extra brain mass compared to what's used, say when you're 20, for new neuron connections to be made for other pathways to be used and literally television does lower brain waves after just a few minutes down to a sleep state.
[01:48:30.809 --> 01:48:37.090]  So it's literally a machine that dulls massively your overall psyche.
[01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:38.590]  Yes, precisely.
[01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:57.538]  Again, if your readers would like to follow up on that idea that Alex just gave you, and please call me John Alex, if you want to follow up on that, in the 1950s a Canadian professor named Marshall McLuhan wrote extensively about this.
[01:48:57.938 --> 01:49:03.000]  His style is a little wacky, but his ideas are right on target.
[01:49:04.613 --> 01:49:07.515]  Well, you also have the five arguments for elimination of television.
[01:49:07.655 --> 01:49:09.677]  Oh, that's a brilliant book.
[01:49:09.757 --> 01:49:14.781]  If you want to take a minute and tell your listeners that, that's a brilliant book.
[01:49:14.841 --> 01:49:17.022]  Marie Nguyen, isn't that?
[01:49:17.363 --> 01:49:18.003]  Yes, yes.
[01:49:18.043 --> 01:49:20.005]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:20.105 --> 01:49:23.287]  I think it's four arguments for the elimination of television.
[01:49:23.307 --> 01:49:23.628]  Yeah, four.
[01:49:23.648 --> 01:49:24.909]  I read it like ten years ago.
[01:49:25.049 --> 01:49:31.254]  But it's a splendid book, and it's written in a conversational style.
[01:49:31.314 --> 01:49:32.555]  It's fully scholarly.
[01:49:33.328 --> 01:49:36.711]  But you know, it's not something that will give you a headache after you read it.
[01:49:36.731 --> 01:49:38.372]  Alright, we're talking to John Taylor Gatto.
[01:49:38.392 --> 01:49:44.557]  We gotta hurry into, currently, what's happening in the last five minutes, then certainly, sir, gotta have a part three.
[01:49:44.937 --> 01:49:52.382]  I meant to have you on two hours a day, but I double booked, so if you'd grace us with your presence again next week or the week after that, that would be greatly appreciated.
[01:49:54.744 --> 01:49:56.125]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:56.145 --> 01:49:58.227]  A new world order.
[01:49:58.954 --> 01:50:03.201]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:50:03.862 --> 01:50:05.665]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:50:06.687 --> 01:50:08.951]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:50:09.492 --> 01:50:11.855]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:12.655 --> 01:50:20.021]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:23.003 --> 01:50:28.007]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:28.487 --> 01:50:31.870]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:34.831]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:50:34.871 --> 01:50:35.851]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.871 --> 01:50:36.812]  They're not after money.
[01:50:36.832 --> 01:50:37.892]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:38.112 --> 01:50:38.892]  They're after power.
[01:50:39.092 --> 01:50:40.113]  That's what they're after.

[01:50:48.535 --> 01:50:49.416]  Endgame.
[01:50:49.716 --> 01:50:51.596]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:50:51.757 --> 01:50:52.897]  You have been warned.
[01:50:53.559 --> 01:50:58.660]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:06.021]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:06.181 --> 01:51:16.803]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:17.003 --> 01:51:21.544]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:21.824 --> 01:51:26.825]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:51:27.025 --> 01:51:29.966]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:30.206 --> 01:51:39.929]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than 2 cents per gallon.
[01:51:39.949 --> 01:51:41.229]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling
[01:51:44.090 --> 01:51:47.952]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp.
[01:51:47.972 --> 01:51:48.792]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[01:52:03.343 --> 01:52:07.786]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[01:52:08.127 --> 01:52:10.228]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[01:52:10.588 --> 01:52:12.730]  They keep you down, they keep you blue.
[01:52:13.010 --> 01:52:15.932]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[01:52:17.954 --> 01:52:20.055]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[01:52:20.416 --> 01:52:25.800]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[01:52:27.681 --> 01:52:32.222]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[01:52:32.262 --> 01:52:36.504]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:52:37.104 --> 01:52:41.985]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[01:52:42.045 --> 01:52:46.506]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:52:46.546 --> 01:52:48.667]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.
[01:52:48.767 --> 01:52:50.948]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:53:05.413 --> 01:53:12.076]  Bottom line, top scientists got together over 150 years ago
[01:53:35.297 --> 01:53:37.920]  And we're all the richest families in England, Europe, and Germany.
[01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:44.706]  And they all wrote public books and laughed that you'd never read scientific journals, even back then.
[01:53:46.148 --> 01:53:49.429]  And they have incrementally done exactly what they say they do.
[01:53:50.249 --> 01:53:52.570]  Mr. Gatto, you know more than I do even about this.
[01:53:52.610 --> 01:53:55.611]  I'm always amazed that you know even the next step and I go look at it and you're accurate.
[01:53:55.951 --> 01:54:02.893]  Then I'm sure you learn in your writings there are a bunch of eugenicists that want to have a world government to force population reductions.
[01:54:03.933 --> 01:54:06.974]  I'm sure in your research you ran into that over and over again too, right?
[01:54:07.694 --> 01:54:14.996]  Over and over again, because as I said when I alluded to Darwin's book, The Descent of Man,
[01:54:16.594 --> 01:54:28.561]  Even these power-hungry men, and they're largely male, even these power-hungry men have to have some sort of a justification for what they're doing.
[01:54:29.122 --> 01:54:42.189]  So they tried religious justifications, and they tried philosophical justifications, they tried psychological justifications, but finally where they met bedrock they could stand on,
[01:54:42.662 --> 01:54:45.083]  was biological inferiority.
[01:54:45.603 --> 01:54:51.065]  Obviously sensible people would realize that you can't cure that.
[01:54:51.325 --> 01:54:57.887]  There isn't any way to cure that and therefore you have to protect yourself, the good breeding stock, away from it.
[01:54:58.207 --> 01:55:00.227]  This is where the eugenicists come in.
[01:55:00.567 --> 01:55:05.369]  They really land in the western part of the United States.
[01:55:05.389 --> 01:55:09.490]  They're generated out of the eastern United States, but they land out at
[01:55:10.086 --> 01:55:29.194]  Stanford University, just at the turn of the 20th century, and they begin teaching how to take control of evolution by controlling, as an animal or plant breeder would control, by controlling genetics.
[01:55:29.654 --> 01:55:31.155]  And there are quite a few books.
[01:55:31.275 --> 01:55:34.396]  It's simply that if you're not aware they exist,
[01:55:35.009 --> 01:55:36.989]  You can't do what you've been doing.
[01:55:37.089 --> 01:56:02.695]  By the way, I mean I told you this last time you were on briefly, you know, my dad was top of his class and they took like the 125 smartest high school seniors, I think it was actually a junior then, and they sent them to the University of Texas and the head of the botany department was running these months of intensive testing and they took the top six kids, and my dad was one of them, and said, well there's a secret world government, we're going to have to get rid of most people,
[01:56:03.675 --> 01:56:11.337]  You are, you know, the genetic cream and we're going to need you to continue to go through schooling and prepare yourselves for this and my dad's like, I'm out of here.
[01:56:11.697 --> 01:56:13.877]  And he never even told me that until a few months ago.
[01:56:14.238 --> 01:56:20.099]  The point is, this is going, and you talk about plant breeders, he was the head of UT Botany, was the head guy, he was also a German.
[01:56:20.999 --> 01:56:26.740]  Well, you brought that up at the end of our time together and that's just fine.
[01:56:27.061 --> 01:56:28.981]  That idea you're talking about,
[01:56:29.525 --> 01:56:52.620]  was cooked up most succinctly and powerfully by two sociologists right at the beginning of the twentieth century and they said you're not going to be able to pull this project off unless you can drain the most obvious mental talent out of the lower orders and you do that by paying them off.
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:55.462]  And by the way, they point blank told a junior in high school this.
[01:56:56.505 --> 01:56:57.866]  Well, sure, you have to.
[01:56:57.886 --> 01:57:03.231]  This is... I'll just put the dog on and use the Latin term.
[01:57:03.271 --> 01:57:16.401]  This is the propaedutic function, which basically means, if you get a good project underway, how are you going to transmit it to the next generation unless you train people directly in what's going on?
[01:57:16.421 --> 01:57:17.943]  You don't have to train many.
[01:57:18.423 --> 01:57:20.165]  Maybe one out of a thousand.
[01:57:20.605 --> 01:57:25.429]  But somebody has to know what's going on so that they can continue it.
[01:57:26.822 --> 01:57:28.002]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:57:28.863 --> 01:57:31.485]  Stay there because I'm going to do five more minutes and George Humphrey is coming in.

[01:58:02.774 --> 01:58:06.896]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.196 --> 01:58:12.698]  My good friend George Humphrey is going to be in the studio with us in five minutes after this quick segment.
[01:58:13.408 --> 01:58:23.615]  He's an economist, former city council member, author, documentary filmmaker, and a leading figure in the fight for free humanity against the New World Order crime syndicate and their wicked engineers and scientists.
[01:58:24.195 --> 01:58:38.585]  Now that's coming up in the next segment again as we attempt to alert the people with our limited capacity, though the numbers are growing, to the grave threat we're all under with the scientific dictatorship now entering its foretold extermination phase.
[01:58:39.225 --> 01:58:41.406]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, we're doing the best we can.
[01:58:41.687 --> 01:58:44.768]  John Taylor Gatto, of course, was a big advertising man in New York.
[01:58:45.169 --> 01:58:53.093]  He then got involved part-time in education, became a teacher for 30 years in New York because of his love of that, and several times was Teacher of the Year.
[01:58:53.674 --> 01:58:55.235]  He thought education was broken.
[01:58:55.275 --> 01:58:57.296]  He then discovered that it was all by design.
[01:58:57.536 --> 01:58:59.237]  We've got about three minutes left with you, sir.
[01:58:59.637 --> 01:59:03.480]  Finish up any other key points you want to make about the scientific dictatorship.
[01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:07.462]  Some of the source documents are for folks to check, like your free book on your website.
[01:59:08.082 --> 01:59:10.264]  And just how we fight this.
[01:59:10.324 --> 01:59:15.228]  I mean, I believe it's just, if someone becomes aware, the innate human mind is still there.
[01:59:15.588 --> 01:59:18.890]  Once they discover they're in a box, they can then figure out how to get out of it.
[01:59:20.572 --> 01:59:23.013]  That's the Alice in Wonderland principle.
[01:59:23.574 --> 01:59:32.080]  Once you discover that all of this, this menacing apparatus, they're just a pile of cards.
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:34.302]  Once you understand what's going on,
[01:59:34.747 --> 01:59:51.931]  You withdraw your own cooperation, without putting a billboard up, you withdraw your children, you talk to your neighbors, and as you said an hour ago at the beginning of the show, as you spread this around, the ripples are like a stone being thrown in water.
[01:59:52.272 --> 02:00:01.654]  What's underway right now are the last stages of globalizing this thing and creating
[02:00:02.282 --> 02:00:06.966]  A virtual world government in every nation that matters.
[02:00:07.807 --> 02:00:10.649]  Most of the nations of the world, of course, don't matter.
[02:00:10.690 --> 02:00:16.214]  But in the ones that matter, there is an international government already.
[02:00:16.274 --> 02:00:17.736]  It's a shadow government.
[02:00:18.977 --> 02:00:28.225]  So that all of the attempts to keep this thing stable while replacing American jobs with
[02:00:28.826 --> 02:00:30.026]  Jobs from wherever.
[02:00:30.106 --> 02:00:32.527]  I won't name a particular country.
[02:00:32.807 --> 02:00:51.454]  The idea is to destroy the idea of nationality, which is one of the grounds of meaning that we all have, just as they have worked for a century to destroy the sanctity of the family, because that's a tough nut to crack.
[02:00:52.054 --> 02:00:56.976]  But nationality is under heavy siege right now.
[02:00:57.586 --> 02:01:01.850]  And is in a state of advanced collapse in most places.
[02:01:03.292 --> 02:01:06.995]  And it's taught in universities as a good thing.
[02:01:07.596 --> 02:01:14.322]  We'll now hand management over to the best people drawn from the world's population.
[02:01:14.382 --> 02:01:21.790]  At that point, we are all in jail, and I don't know what key would open that lock.
[02:01:25.223 --> 02:01:31.045]  Read Carol Quigley's Tragedy and Hope, A History of the World in Our Time.
[02:01:31.425 --> 02:01:34.906]  It is an immortal work of the 20th century.
[02:01:35.046 --> 02:01:38.708]  Quigley was an internationally famous scholar.
[02:01:39.248 --> 02:01:48.611]  He was Bill Clinton's personal tutor at Georgetown University, and he wrote extensively
[02:01:49.173 --> 02:01:51.155]  Chapter and verse on this.
[02:01:51.636 --> 02:02:05.529]  The publisher destroyed the plates of the book, but thanks to the efforts of a number of really courageous people, the book was illegally kept in print on the fringes.
[02:02:05.610 --> 02:02:08.873]  And now I understand, although I'd have to see it for myself,
[02:02:09.273 --> 02:02:09.573]  You can.
[02:02:09.693 --> 02:02:11.915]  Can your producer give my wife a call?
[02:02:12.055 --> 02:02:13.736]  I move around a lot, but she'll set up.
[02:02:38.024 --> 02:02:40.204]  Close controller for my schedule.
[02:02:40.224 --> 02:02:41.025]  I understand.
[02:02:41.065 --> 02:02:42.065]  God bless you, sir.
[02:02:42.425 --> 02:02:45.125]  Thank you for all the time and thank you for your vital work for humanity.
[02:02:46.726 --> 02:02:48.146]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:48.166 --> 02:02:50.266]  A new world order.
[02:02:50.966 --> 02:02:55.747]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:02:55.927 --> 02:02:57.608]  Known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:02:57.848 --> 02:03:00.948]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:03:01.468 --> 02:03:03.889]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:04.648 --> 02:03:11.975]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:15.006 --> 02:03:19.969]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:23.952]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:24.332 --> 02:03:26.834]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:03:26.894 --> 02:03:27.855]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:27.875 --> 02:03:28.815]  They're not after money.
[02:03:28.835 --> 02:03:29.916]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:30.116 --> 02:03:30.877]  They're after power.
[02:03:31.097 --> 02:03:31.977]  That's what they're after, you see.

[02:04:45.735 --> 02:04:49.058]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[02:04:49.398 --> 02:04:56.325]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:04:56.685 --> 02:05:09.176]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000 year old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[02:05:09.417 --> 02:05:12.059]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[02:05:12.399 --> 02:05:18.584]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[02:05:18.824 --> 02:05:23.968]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now, a small amount is available to my listeners.
[02:05:24.208 --> 02:05:32.475]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.

[02:05:35.797 --> 02:05:40.919]  Simply go to 321relief.com or call 815-259-4552 for details.
[02:05:40.939 --> 02:05:52.584]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.126 --> 02:06:00.467]  Well, my good personal friend and a real scholar,
[02:06:01.517 --> 02:06:03.838]  He's our guest for this hour.
[02:06:04.558 --> 02:06:15.501]  He's George Humphrey, former city council member, a degreed economist, very successful private businessman in clothing lines, real estate, all sorts of other things.
[02:06:15.901 --> 02:06:19.903]  So he's uniquely placed to come on the show and talk about what's happening to the economy.
[02:06:19.943 --> 02:06:20.943]  Of course, his analysis
[02:06:21.703 --> 02:06:31.251]  Messes with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the father of Reaganomics, and former head of the Treasury, and of course Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Prize winner, former chief economist, World Bank we've had on.
[02:06:32.051 --> 02:06:50.386]  And what we talked about 10 years ago, we talked about 12 years ago, I remember George 15 years ago, before I was even involved on television, here locally, and then radio, I remember going to events and seeing George there, and he was the supposed big liberal out supporting Pat Buchanan in the early 90s and 96, because he saw that Pat had better ideas on what the establishment
[02:06:50.866 --> 02:06:51.366]  We're good to go.
[02:07:19.261 --> 02:07:21.604]  They actually did it the week before last, but it came out this week.
[02:07:21.985 --> 02:07:25.609]  Demanded its 26 billion dollars just out of a couple funds.
[02:07:25.629 --> 02:07:26.410]  They have a lot more than that.
[02:07:26.450 --> 02:07:30.215]  I mean, Texas has hundreds and hundreds of billions in their double set of books.
[02:07:30.235 --> 02:07:31.136]  This is not on budget.
[02:07:31.176 --> 02:07:32.077]  This is the big fraud.
[02:07:32.277 --> 02:07:34.280]  How they took our money, gave it to the internationalists.
[02:07:34.820 --> 02:07:36.521]  They're demanding their $26 billion.
[02:07:36.581 --> 02:07:39.223]  At first they said, OK, we'll give you $18 billion.
[02:07:39.283 --> 02:07:41.004]  Now they're saying we may not even give you that.
[02:07:41.465 --> 02:07:42.785]  Other states are demanding their money.
[02:07:43.126 --> 02:07:49.270]  They AAA-rated all this corporate paper, and this makes the subprime thing look like a joke.
[02:07:49.650 --> 02:07:52.692]  That's kind of like an overall cover they give to make it look like the people did it.
[02:07:53.252 --> 02:07:54.352]  I love being with you and as I've always
[02:08:16.098 --> 02:08:17.739]  I really appreciate what you're doing.
[02:08:17.779 --> 02:08:29.125]  There's so many ways to fight this thing, and I'll tell you what, my friends, if you're listening, I know that you understand the importance of this message, and information is power.
[02:08:29.165 --> 02:08:32.146]  It is an information war, and it all starts with money.
[02:08:32.686 --> 02:08:34.247]  Always follow the money.
[02:08:34.547 --> 02:08:35.788]  Always follow the money.
[02:08:35.968 --> 02:08:41.371]  When I became a city councilman here in Austin, Texas, and there was something going on, I'd always follow the money.
[02:08:41.811 --> 02:08:43.432]  Now, the fact is, is that a group of
[02:08:44.554 --> 02:09:00.220]  Internationalists, whether you want to call them the Power Elite, the Illuminati, the Political Zionists, the Black Hats, whatever you want to call these rascals, is that they control the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Federal Reserve, and that they want to break the United States government.
[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:08.243]  The United States is the last bastion of freedom in this world, and the way to do that is to break our economic system.
[02:09:10.186 --> 02:09:21.773]  It doesn't take a degree in economics to understand that the United States of America, whether you believe that there really is a country or whether it's a corporation, is that we are bankrupt.
[02:09:22.333 --> 02:09:34.300]  And what is going on right now is what is called the tranches or the trenches, and that they're taking all these loans that have been bundled together, the second loans, the subprime loans, and as
[02:09:35.655 --> 02:09:43.841]  Any economist will tell you for the last eight years the money supply, the M3, has been incredibly, unbelievably loose.
[02:09:44.302 --> 02:09:46.423]  We've never had a period of time like this.
[02:09:47.404 --> 02:09:51.507]  And what they did is that they funneled a lot of this money into loans.
[02:09:51.567 --> 02:09:53.569]  People were buying houses, $750,000 homes that were making $50,000, $55,000 a year.
[02:09:58.613 --> 02:10:01.737]  This has been unbelievable insanity.
[02:10:02.137 --> 02:10:16.433]  But the real insanity is, is that the people who are putting together these loans, package these together, and they would get triple A status, sell these to communities and to hedge funds all over.
[02:10:17.404 --> 02:10:23.547]  And now you take a look at the 10 largest banking corporations here in the West.
[02:10:23.988 --> 02:10:30.631]  Bank of America, Citibank, JP Morgan, Wachovia, Goldman Sachs.
[02:10:31.812 --> 02:10:39.976]  Every single one of these banking institutions, except Morgan Stanley, have more what are called third level assets.
[02:10:40.717 --> 02:10:45.119]  These are assets that are made up of these tranches, then they have
[02:10:45.686 --> 02:10:46.747]  Why don't you fill them in?
[02:11:11.525 --> 02:11:23.452]  Okay, well quite clearly, as we all know, the Fed is an illegal institution or unconstitutional, but in the 1990s, the Fed together with Goldman Sachs and J.P.
[02:11:23.492 --> 02:11:33.198]  Morgan started buying stocks and commodities directly when those stocks and commodities started going down.
[02:11:33.518 --> 02:11:39.362]  For example, the Xerox Corporation, we say that we're in a private enterprise or capitalist system.
[02:11:40.055 --> 02:11:46.297]  Over 70% of the Xerox stock is owned by these people.
[02:11:46.357 --> 02:11:49.498]  These people who have just created this money out of thin air.
[02:11:49.678 --> 02:11:51.319]  And let's expand on that.
[02:11:51.459 --> 02:11:56.340]  Generally, nations had 5 to 1, 8 to 1, 10 to 1, 12 to 1 with fractional reserve banking.
[02:11:56.381 --> 02:11:59.922]  The average being about 10 was kind of the British model going back 500 years ago.
[02:12:01.102 --> 02:12:19.949]  They then, in what, 1993, said, no, now we can just have private rating services rate debt, and then we can loan out to infinity, we can create subsidiary banks that then also leverage out to the power of ten, and then so you can have one dollar inflated to a billion dollars, and it's a mountain of money.
[02:12:19.969 --> 02:12:22.950]  They had to do it because they want global domination.
[02:12:23.170 --> 02:12:27.312]  By creating these mountains of fiat currency, they were able to buy up the true global infrastructure.
[02:12:27.452 --> 02:12:29.034]  Absolutely.
[02:12:29.434 --> 02:12:31.896]  And we can go to infinity in talking about this.
[02:12:31.936 --> 02:12:33.638]  We can talk about the derivatives.
[02:12:34.078 --> 02:12:37.401]  Right now we're talking about the subprime loans, the trenches.
[02:12:37.682 --> 02:12:43.007]  Now I see numbers, and you're a great economist, but I've been listening to other ones, saying it's between just with the top 20 banks.
[02:12:43.667 --> 02:12:56.659]  Uh, and then what they have leveraged in their subsidiaries, that last year, 12 months ago, in December of last year, these are November numbers, November of last year, there was $750 trillion in leveraged derivatives.
[02:12:56.779 --> 02:12:59.942]  Now they're saying it exponentially doubled to $1,500 trillion.
[02:13:03.027 --> 02:13:12.630]  Well, we're going from the trenches of derivatives, which is an exponential jump, and discussing derivatives is like watching the movie The Matrix.
[02:13:13.130 --> 02:13:14.090]  Nobody knows.
[02:13:14.850 --> 02:13:16.131]  Nobody knows.
[02:13:16.231 --> 02:13:23.053]  But we do know that in 1929, we had a depression because stocks were being leveraged at 10 to 1.
[02:13:24.548 --> 02:13:32.494]  The derivatives market, which was born in the early 90s, started about a 20 to 1, 30 to 1, then went up to 100 to 1.
[02:13:32.914 --> 02:13:49.907]  Now, it's my understanding that the average derivatives that the corporations and the municipalities are putting in their portfolios are at least a 40 to 1 leverage, and that at using the most conservative numbers,
[02:13:50.507 --> 02:13:56.832]  Is that there's over 75 billion dollars worth of domestic derivatives out there.
[02:13:57.072 --> 02:14:00.495]  And remember, a derivative has no intrinsic value.
[02:14:00.515 --> 02:14:05.639]  But they're actually now calling those assets, and then banks are loaning those out.
[02:14:05.799 --> 02:14:06.160]  Absolutely.
[02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:14.726]  That's the calculation, and then in the call margin with the currencies, because I've seen mainstream publications saying that it's in the thousands of trillions.
[02:14:15.688 --> 02:14:16.529]  We just don't know.
[02:14:16.549 --> 02:14:21.359]  I mean, you know, I hear these numbers and I get this stuff every day.
[02:14:23.198 --> 02:14:25.600]  It really doesn't make any difference.
[02:14:25.781 --> 02:14:28.343]  After you're dead, you can only be dead one time.
[02:14:28.863 --> 02:14:33.087]  It's kind of like saying, are they going to drop 50 million nuclear bombs on the earth, or 50 trillion?
[02:14:33.267 --> 02:14:34.308]  Correct.
[02:14:34.388 --> 02:14:39.473]  With the gross national product of this country, about $11.5 trillion.
[02:14:39.873 --> 02:14:45.558]  Now, if the derivative market is at the most conservative number, which is 65 or 70,
[02:14:50.541 --> 02:15:06.665]  Well, I try to have a simplified analogy of this, George, and that's you have a football field that's the imaginary money, and then real assets is a postage stamp.
[02:15:06.925 --> 02:15:11.926]  And I've had economists tell me, no, it's kind of like the city of Dallas in a postage stamp.
[02:15:13.587 --> 02:15:27.854]  Whatever it is, even the trained economists, and there are wonderfully intelligent economists here in Austin and around Texas and around this country, who don't even know about it, who are totally ignorant about it.
[02:15:27.874 --> 02:15:29.495]  Well, they teach them in a compartmentalized fashion.
[02:15:29.515 --> 02:15:30.215]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:15:30.235 --> 02:15:35.838]  Even in banking, only one out of a thousand bankers in England is taken and sent to special schools, private schools,
[02:15:36.718 --> 02:15:37.239]  Absolutely.
[02:15:37.359 --> 02:15:40.560]  And the ignorance about this is just overwhelming.
[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:42.501]  And it's not that these people are stupid.
[02:15:42.761 --> 02:15:45.082]  They just haven't been given the information.
[02:15:45.422 --> 02:15:47.363]  And it's just like the shadow government.
[02:15:47.604 --> 02:15:50.185]  There's something going on behind the facade.
[02:15:50.705 --> 02:15:54.527]  And so, but using the most conservative numbers,
[02:15:55.297 --> 02:16:01.261]  Is that what we're talking about is a derivative debt that is five to six times the GNP.
[02:16:01.321 --> 02:16:06.165]  And this is not even talking about personal debt, corporate debt, private debt.
[02:16:06.205 --> 02:16:08.506]  This isn't talking about the trenches.
[02:16:08.546 --> 02:16:11.408]  This isn't talking about our trade surplus.
[02:16:11.829 --> 02:16:13.890]  This is just talking about the derivatives.
[02:16:14.250 --> 02:16:16.732]  And if your information is correct,
[02:16:17.483 --> 02:16:20.045]  I mean, it's so far out in space.
[02:16:20.285 --> 02:16:23.007]  But again, you can only kill somebody one time.
[02:16:23.107 --> 02:16:32.833]  So whether it's 60 trillion or 200 trillion or whatever the trillion is times X, the economy is on
[02:16:34.226 --> 02:16:34.466]  I don't
[02:16:48.729 --> 02:16:51.351]  You know, I was trained as a fundamental economist.
[02:16:51.691 --> 02:16:57.395]  And anybody who looks at the fundamentals of what's going on knew long, long, long, long ago.
[02:16:57.415 --> 02:17:02.619]  10, 15 years I was yelling and screaming about this because I was looking at the fundamentals.
[02:17:02.940 --> 02:17:06.822]  But now, and I kept on going, the market's overpriced.
[02:17:06.922 --> 02:17:09.224]  Our balance of trade is killing us.
[02:17:10.085 --> 02:17:11.045]  We're losing jobs.
[02:17:11.086 --> 02:17:12.527]  We're going to have a recession.
[02:17:12.767 --> 02:17:15.989]  But the economy just kept on exploiting and getting bigger and bigger.
[02:17:16.009 --> 02:17:16.990]  And I was going, what's going on?
[02:17:17.450 --> 02:17:23.913]  And then it finally dawned on my thick head, is that it's the emotion, it's the illusion that drives things.
[02:17:23.933 --> 02:17:30.876]  So the question here is, that the best numbers, we're being shot 500 times, and with the bad numbers, we're being shot 5 billion times.
[02:17:31.516 --> 02:17:32.617]  Whatever the numbers are.
[02:17:33.057 --> 02:17:41.560]  And you know, the point is, is that the poison bullets are out there, whether it's the balance of trade, the deficit spending... We're going to break.
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:42.721]  Let's come back and talk more about that.
[02:17:46.375 --> 02:17:46.815]  Gold.
[02:17:47.155 --> 02:17:48.416]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:17:48.696 --> 02:17:54.777]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:17:54.977 --> 02:17:58.778]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:17:59.138 --> 02:18:01.019]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:18:01.079 --> 02:18:03.359]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:18:03.519 --> 02:18:11.101]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[02:18:11.221 --> 02:18:12.022]  We're good to go.
[02:18:26.732 --> 02:18:27.052]  We're good to go.
[02:18:45.985 --> 02:18:48.366]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:49.007 --> 02:18:53.289]  Did you know that the United Nations has never fulfilled its sole goal for existing?
[02:18:53.829 --> 02:18:55.050]  Maintaining world peace?
[02:18:55.630 --> 02:18:56.530]  Do you know why?
[02:18:56.731 --> 02:18:59.032]  Everywhere they've been involved, it becomes worse.

[02:19:18.791 --> 02:19:25.034]  Did you know the rogue nations and terrorist organizations have been purchasing suitcase nuclear bombs on the black market?
[02:19:25.794 --> 02:19:27.175]  Will they use them on America?

[02:19:46.267 --> 02:19:46.667]  Attention!
[02:19:46.787 --> 02:19:49.569]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[02:19:49.889 --> 02:19:54.191]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:19:54.511 --> 02:19:55.192]  Listen closely.
[02:19:55.832 --> 02:20:03.316]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[02:20:03.596 --> 02:20:12.380]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[02:20:12.700 --> 02:20:15.622]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country,
[02:20:15.862 --> 02:20:18.183]  No health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[02:20:18.463 --> 02:20:27.928]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[02:20:28.128 --> 02:20:33.770]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[02:20:33.950 --> 02:20:37.532]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[02:20:37.752 --> 02:20:41.114]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:46.240]  Hi, Ken.
[02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:47.060]  It's Judy again.
[02:20:47.080 --> 02:20:51.602]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[02:20:51.762 --> 02:20:54.903]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[02:20:55.123 --> 02:20:57.003]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[02:20:57.283 --> 02:20:59.344]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[02:20:59.544 --> 02:21:05.646]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[02:21:05.846 --> 02:21:11.148]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[02:21:11.408 --> 02:21:14.249]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:15.309]  Go KenSolar!
[02:21:16.596 --> 02:21:18.137]  Get the best of both worlds.

[02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:25.221]  Perfect for hurricane seasons.
[02:21:25.541 --> 02:21:29.043]  No long gas lines, no fumes and no noise.
[02:21:29.743 --> 02:21:32.425]  Lower your electric bill and be prepared year-round.
[02:21:33.065 --> 02:21:35.407]  Complete solar kits for under $1,200.

[02:21:39.909 --> 02:21:43.731]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.
[02:21:49.940 --> 02:21:59.283]  George Humphrey is our guest, in-studio economist, former city council member, successful businessman.
[02:22:00.124 --> 02:22:04.085]  Our listeners have heard about the derivatives, they've heard about the trenches, I interrupted when you were getting into those.
[02:22:04.505 --> 02:22:06.166]  We now have the states pulling their money out.
[02:22:06.186 --> 02:22:15.710]  There's counties, school districts, hundreds of thousands of governmental institutions who've been secretly investing off-budget in the comprehensive annual financial reports.
[02:22:16.743 --> 02:22:20.884]  Talk more about that in a little segment we have here, and then what do you think is going to happen next year?
[02:22:20.904 --> 02:22:25.905]  Most people I've talked to say that the plunge has already started, but it's going to get really nasty middle of next year.
[02:22:25.945 --> 02:22:27.545]  That seems to be the mean there.
[02:22:27.585 --> 02:22:29.746]  The average expert is saying that.
[02:22:30.086 --> 02:22:31.386]  What does George Humphrey think?
[02:22:31.426 --> 02:22:32.706]  What do you see in the crystal ball?
[02:22:32.966 --> 02:22:35.887]  Well, the reality is, is what goes up goes down.
[02:22:36.207 --> 02:22:41.028]  And in the United States, we've had about 18 years of bull market.
[02:22:41.528 --> 02:22:58.398]  This is the longest bull market period that we've had since 1870 that since they've been figuring this thing out and not only has it been the longest but it's been the biggest and if you look at the actual amounts of money it's just exponentially so much
[02:22:59.758 --> 02:23:00.959]  Bigger than anything else.
[02:23:02.060 --> 02:23:06.063]  And if you take a look at the market, if you take a look at the stock market, the average P.E.
[02:23:06.123 --> 02:23:08.505]  ratio is about 25 or 26 to 1.
[02:23:09.265 --> 02:23:12.308]  The national average for the last 150 years is 13 to 1.
[02:23:13.349 --> 02:23:18.853]  Every single fundamental of economics is inflated right now.
[02:23:20.038 --> 02:23:23.099]  Every single fundamental of economics is inflated.
[02:23:23.439 --> 02:23:30.262]  Now, this has been done with smoke and mirrors, it's been done with fiat currency, out of thin air, all of this stuff.
[02:23:30.642 --> 02:23:35.184]  But eventually, eventually, if you're gonna dance, you gotta pay the fiddler!
[02:23:36.105 --> 02:23:39.987]  And the Fiddler's been asking for his money for a little period of time.
[02:23:40.007 --> 02:23:46.229]  We're seeing unbelievable... Is it going to be much worse that they've extended it out so far and pumped the bubble up to galactic proportions?
[02:23:46.269 --> 02:23:46.849]  Well, of course.
[02:23:47.209 --> 02:23:50.511]  The bigger the balloon gets, the louder the pop.
[02:23:51.171 --> 02:23:57.973]  And now, I've been talking about this for a long period of time, and the balloon just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[02:23:58.393 --> 02:24:04.876]  Now, whether it's going to happen next week, or next month, or next year, or when it's going to happen,
[02:24:06.270 --> 02:24:22.725]  Our puppet masters are very, very good at what they do, and we have to remember that we're in an election, and because of the election, Bernanke clearly, clearly is under the control of the neocons, is that it appears as though they're going to cut the prime rate again.
[02:24:22.745 --> 02:24:23.906]  That'll hit the dollar again.
[02:24:24.046 --> 02:24:30.572]  Of course it will, and the dollar has dropped 60% compared to the euro in the last two and a half years.
[02:24:30.572 --> 02:24:39.959]  I mean, just looking at normal inflation trends and currency devaluations, it normally takes within a year to 24 months for it fully to have repercussions internally.
[02:24:40.259 --> 02:24:41.280]  It hits their last.
[02:24:42.061 --> 02:24:44.242]  It looks like it's happening now faster here.
[02:24:44.503 --> 02:24:49.807]  What's going to happen when people find out in the middle of next year going into an election that a $20,000 car is $40,000, that a $2 gallon of milk is now $5?
[02:24:49.847 --> 02:24:51.028]  I mean, that's already starting.
[02:24:51.088 --> 02:24:52.088]  What's going to happen?
[02:24:57.995 --> 02:25:00.659]  Well, I wish I could tell you exactly what was going to happen.
[02:25:00.699 --> 02:25:04.363]  Anybody who says that they can't tell you exactly what's going to happen is just blowing smoke.
[02:25:04.423 --> 02:25:05.965]  But I mean, what's your guesstimation?
[02:25:06.005 --> 02:25:11.452]  Well, my guesstimation is that they're going to try and string this thing through the next election.
[02:25:11.873 --> 02:25:13.215]  But quite clearly,
[02:25:13.835 --> 02:25:17.137]  There's too many cracks in the dam, and they've got their fingers in it all.
[02:25:17.177 --> 02:25:18.177]  Now it's rumbling.
[02:25:18.458 --> 02:25:21.239]  It's breaking all around them.
[02:25:21.619 --> 02:25:26.602]  See, the thing about these tranches and these subprime loans, we haven't seen the worst of it.
[02:25:26.662 --> 02:25:33.446]  In the first quarter and the second quarter of 2008, that's when the real economic tsunami
[02:25:36.525 --> 02:25:39.948]  Prime loans, or their sub-prime loans, are coming in.
[02:25:40.088 --> 02:25:43.851]  We've now had over 700 billion globally by central banks pumped in.
[02:25:45.312 --> 02:25:47.034]  And this is all out of thin air.
[02:25:47.054 --> 02:25:57.062]  They're just creating credit, and every time they do this, your money and your bank and your savings account becomes worth that much less.
[02:25:57.383 --> 02:26:01.646]  So if you've got... Well, politically, when it does fall, what's the public going to do when they find out about this?
[02:26:02.527 --> 02:26:03.648]  Well, we have
[02:26:04.739 --> 02:26:18.429]  A group of sheep in this country and we have a group of people who are waking up and the people who are waking up are such as yourself, but it's not just George Humphrey and Alex and Jack Bloods and Ron Pauls and the other people around.
[02:26:19.306 --> 02:26:24.209]  The number of people waking up is increasing exponentially.
[02:26:24.229 --> 02:26:25.389]  We're all calling out.
[02:26:25.449 --> 02:26:28.651]  I deal with very intelligent investors with a great deal of money.
[02:26:38.536 --> 02:26:49.644]  And it is amazing to me that some of these people are still so blind to the clear and present danger to their funds, to the money that they are taking care of.
[02:26:49.924 --> 02:26:55.728]  And let's say that some financial guy has a billion dollars of funds that he's taking care of and the dollar goes down 10%.
[02:26:56.949 --> 02:26:59.150]  He's just lost a hundred million dollars.
[02:26:59.651 --> 02:27:04.133]  And the dollar has really gone down more than 60% in the last seven years of purchasing power.
[02:27:04.514 --> 02:27:08.476]  Since 1913, it's over 90 plus percent.
[02:27:09.056 --> 02:27:13.379]  But now, since 1913, the dollar has inflated 2,700%.
[02:27:14.239 --> 02:27:15.380]  This is amazing.
[02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:18.042]  Let's talk about that when we get back.
[02:27:18.422 --> 02:27:19.182]  Another break here.
[02:27:19.222 --> 02:27:20.403]  Long segment coming up.
[02:27:21.063 --> 02:27:22.184]  I'm going off Ron Paul numbers.
[02:27:22.204 --> 02:27:23.565]  You know, he's just being very conservative.
[02:27:24.105 --> 02:27:27.847]  Yeah, I mean sure, a nickel in 1913 was like five bucks.
[02:27:27.927 --> 02:27:28.347]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:27:28.367 --> 02:27:30.688]  So, yeah, it's more than 90 plus percent.
[02:27:30.728 --> 02:27:32.749]  But we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:27:36.772 --> 02:27:37.732]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.752 --> 02:27:39.753]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.773 --> 02:27:43.395]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.753 --> 02:27:52.239]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:52.679 --> 02:27:56.903]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:57.344 --> 02:28:04.191]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:04.631 --> 02:28:11.338]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:11.658 --> 02:28:13.279]  There are no reported side effects.
[02:28:13.580 --> 02:28:16.763]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:17.023 --> 02:28:18.244]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:18.484 --> 02:28:19.485]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:28:19.805 --> 02:28:26.532]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:26.952 --> 02:28:29.634]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[02:28:33.738 --> 02:28:35.499]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[02:28:46.542 --> 02:28:51.468]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:28:51.788 --> 02:28:53.670]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[02:28:53.870 --> 02:28:56.914]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:28:57.094 --> 02:29:00.237]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:29:00.538 --> 02:29:02.380]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[02:29:02.660 --> 02:29:06.364]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:29:06.644 --> 02:29:09.306]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:29:09.927 --> 02:29:14.211]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:29:14.431 --> 02:29:18.715]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:29:19.116 --> 02:29:23.460]  The Bible says, Would like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, the unholy alliance.
[02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:25.782]  These materials document the global leaders,
[02:29:25.862 --> 02:29:26.082]  We're good.
[02:29:46.661 --> 02:29:49.605]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:29:49.765 --> 02:29:54.951]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:29:55.291 --> 02:30:00.577]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:30:01.018 --> 02:30:02.099]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.479 --> 02:30:11.543]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[02:31:04.985 --> 02:31:15.336]  There must be some kind of way out of here Said a joker to the beat There's too much confusion
[02:31:18.025 --> 02:31:28.309]  I want to have some time to talk about the awakening that's happening.
[02:31:28.369 --> 02:31:31.170]  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[02:31:31.190 --> 02:31:35.372]  I want to talk about other tools the globalists bring this nation down.
[02:31:35.412 --> 02:31:45.036]  But the Financial Times of London reported, and of course I have said this to many others, that really the big central banks, by design, were cutting off credit.
[02:31:45.943 --> 02:31:55.011]  Uh, to some of the subprime people and others to artificially try to control an implosion so they can consolidate and pick up the pieces.
[02:31:55.111 --> 02:31:57.353]  And even the Financial Times of London has admitted that.
[02:31:57.374 --> 02:32:01.377]  So there's also that whole situation taking place there.
[02:32:01.397 --> 02:32:02.338]  Give me your take on that, George.
[02:32:02.518 --> 02:32:16.025]  Well, first of all, again, we don't have all the information, but it's very, very clear that even the most conservative economists and the financial people realize that, at the very minimum, Citibank is pretty much a dead man walking.
[02:32:17.406 --> 02:32:22.809]  It just got a $7 billion infusion from Dubai, but I don't think that's going to be enough.
[02:32:23.269 --> 02:32:31.252]  The amount of third-level assets that they have, which are basically junk, are about three times as much as their total assets.
[02:32:31.292 --> 02:32:33.573]  And what's it going to do is all these states start jerking money?
[02:32:35.133 --> 02:32:44.757]  Well, when the states and when the foreign countries start coming to their senses and start investing in more
[02:32:45.452 --> 02:32:48.754]  Yes, and the important thing is to tell the truth.
[02:33:08.506 --> 02:33:15.172]  What we have to do as patriots, people who love this country, first of all, we have to take care of ourselves.
[02:33:15.212 --> 02:33:26.981]  And the first thing I would highly suggest is that each and every one of you take some very, very simple but significant steps to protect your own finances and the finances of your family and your friends.
[02:33:27.521 --> 02:33:37.344]  And basically that is to get out of debt as much as possible and to get your deposits at least 40 or 50 percent of them.
[02:33:37.364 --> 02:33:41.385]  Again, you have to go to your financial advisors and figure this out for yourself.
[02:33:41.405 --> 02:33:43.905]  But get it out of US-based currencies.
[02:33:44.285 --> 02:33:49.487]  Go and put your money in Canadian bonds or stocks or T-bills.
[02:33:49.847 --> 02:33:50.847]  Go and put your money in
[02:33:51.147 --> 02:33:54.950]  Now, short term, that's fine, but what about when they say the U.S.
[02:33:54.970 --> 02:33:58.352]  really implodes, that it's going to cause Europe and everybody else to have problems?
[02:33:59.653 --> 02:34:01.434]  What I'm talking about is the increment.
[02:34:01.454 --> 02:34:07.758]  Yeah, and clearly, clearly, clearly, and I've been saying this for 15 years, get at least 5 to 10 percent of your assets.
[02:34:07.919 --> 02:34:09.580]  So it's always good to have more baskets?
[02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:10.080]  Yes.
[02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:12.121]  Because if some of the boats get sunk, you're not all sunk.
[02:34:12.222 --> 02:34:13.262]  Into gold and silver.
[02:34:13.402 --> 02:34:14.143]  Now, clearly.
[02:34:14.827 --> 02:34:19.670]  Gold and silver has been a storage of wealth since the beginning of mankind.
[02:34:20.151 --> 02:34:34.921]  And when, you know, when you and I first started talking about this, gold was $300 an ounce, silver was $3.20 an ounce, and I know that you've talked about this, and I'm not, I don't sell gold, I don't make any money out of this, but... Well, I do!
[02:34:35.321 --> 02:34:36.141]  Well, I don't!
[02:34:36.221 --> 02:34:37.022]  And I sleep good at night!
[02:34:37.062 --> 02:34:37.643]  I don't know.
[02:34:53.022 --> 02:34:57.665]  And the cost of doing business goes up and up and up and up.
[02:34:57.745 --> 02:35:10.093]  That's going to cause commodities like food, oil, copper, lumber, oil, gas, silver, gold, meat, the commodities.
[02:35:10.394 --> 02:35:12.975]  We're going to have commodity inflation.
[02:35:13.095 --> 02:35:13.676]  Pork bellies.
[02:35:14.674 --> 02:35:24.023]  Whatever people really need, and quite clearly, you're not really making money by this when it's going up, but you're protecting your assets.
[02:35:24.043 --> 02:35:25.004]  You're just keeping what you've got.
[02:35:25.284 --> 02:35:25.785]  Exactly.
[02:35:25.825 --> 02:35:29.228]  Well, see, I wanted to bring this up to you because you have a stock market at $13,000.
[02:35:29.308 --> 02:35:31.791]  It's been a size 14 selling.
[02:35:32.732 --> 02:35:38.217]  You've got a dollar devalued by 60 plus percent since we opened with the Euro at $2,000.
[02:35:39.518 --> 02:35:45.643]  And so I look at that and I go, wait a minute, the stock market's really below $7,000 then for what those dollars internationally are worth.
[02:35:45.843 --> 02:35:49.005]  That's why the Arabs and others are able to come in and buy up the actual stock market.
[02:35:49.025 --> 02:35:49.625]  Well, exactly.
[02:35:49.986 --> 02:35:59.993]  So explain to a yuppie out there, because I'm telling this, and I know people that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, George, and you have a lot of rich investor friends.
[02:36:00.413 --> 02:36:01.534]  And they have a blind spot.
[02:36:01.554 --> 02:36:07.718]  You go, let me explain to you, the dollar's been devalued, the stock market's really lower, and they go, no, but it's higher.
[02:36:07.738 --> 02:36:11.361]  It's kind of like in Spinal Tap, when they go, why not just have the knob go to 10 but be higher?
[02:36:11.381 --> 02:36:12.102]  And he goes, but it's 11.
[02:36:13.463 --> 02:36:14.383]  It's 11.
[02:36:14.423 --> 02:36:17.906]  It's because they don't get, it's called cognitive dissonance.
[02:36:18.306 --> 02:36:25.391]  It's a psychological defense mechanism when you invest your time, energy, or money into something, and then somebody shows that you're wrong.
[02:36:26.492 --> 02:36:30.975]  It is just something that happens that most people defend their positions.
[02:36:31.015 --> 02:36:38.981]  I spent about three months in Europe this summer, and anybody who doesn't realize the dollar has gone down, just go over to England for a week or so.
[02:36:39.481 --> 02:36:41.683]  Oh, I mean, a cup of tea is like ten bucks.
[02:36:41.803 --> 02:36:44.626]  Oh, it's just unbelievable.
[02:36:45.046 --> 02:36:52.454]  You know, the cheapest little hotel you can find, a motel that's like one star, that's rat-infested, is $170 a night.
[02:36:52.854 --> 02:36:54.015]  It is unbelievable.
[02:36:54.095 --> 02:36:54.976]  A decent place is $400.
[02:36:55.977 --> 02:36:56.517]  Absolutely.
[02:36:56.998 --> 02:37:03.184]  And the point is, is that people have to become responsible for themselves.
[02:37:03.804 --> 02:37:09.049]  Uncle Daddy Bush, Uncle Grandma Clinton, they're not going to take care of you.
[02:37:09.069 --> 02:37:10.391]  They're working for the man.
[02:37:10.431 --> 02:37:11.912]  They're working for other people.
[02:37:12.232 --> 02:37:14.074]  We're not getting the right information.
[02:37:14.094 --> 02:37:14.575]  The U.S.
[02:37:14.635 --> 02:37:19.500]  government just came out last quarter and said that inflation was one and three quarters percent.
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:20.801]  Hogwash!
[02:37:21.361 --> 02:37:22.062]  Inflation is
[02:37:37.589 --> 02:37:45.495]  Well, what about them saying the North American Union and now they're saying Trans-Texas Corridor doesn't exist in Newsweek and on CNN?
[02:37:45.515 --> 02:37:47.937]  They just say it doesn't exist.
[02:37:48.517 --> 02:37:56.603]  I saw a big front page article in the paper the other day and it said there is no such thing as the North American Union.
[02:37:56.623 --> 02:37:59.025]  Well, they went further in that Boston Globe story in the States.
[02:37:59.865 --> 02:38:02.126]  They say there's no SPP, basically.
[02:38:02.146 --> 02:38:05.849]  They say there's no... But I mean, I've got CNN on tape saying there's no transactus corridor.
[02:38:06.129 --> 02:38:08.790]  Doesn't matter, there's billboards everywhere and official government and laws.
[02:38:08.810 --> 02:38:14.193]  It's just like the book 1984, you know, war is peace and peace is war and love is hate.
[02:38:14.914 --> 02:38:16.575]  So if you don't like something, it doesn't exist.
[02:38:16.635 --> 02:38:23.238]  Yeah, and so what we're looking at right now is that we're looking at a bill in Congress, House Bill 1955, H.R.
[02:38:23.278 --> 02:38:24.379]  Bill, and Senate Bill 1959.
[02:38:28.365 --> 02:38:29.566]  And I know you know about this.
[02:38:29.847 --> 02:38:33.510]  That makes thought crime a felony.
[02:38:34.031 --> 02:38:36.493]  Now, friends, it doesn't say that in the bill.
[02:38:36.533 --> 02:38:39.276]  It's very amorphous in the language.
[02:38:39.376 --> 02:38:42.099]  But it sets up a policing state.
[02:38:42.659 --> 02:38:49.106]  Well, it says if you say something that doesn't call for violence, but that they can claim to influence somebody, now you're a criminal.
[02:38:49.446 --> 02:38:53.709]  And what we're talking about is 1984 on steroids.
[02:38:53.969 --> 02:39:00.813]  Friends, this is not... I mean, now they're like out of Fahrenheit 451, they're hiring the firefighters to fight terror and crime.
[02:39:00.833 --> 02:39:01.473]  There's no real terror.
[02:39:01.654 --> 02:39:03.174]  So now they're in your house spying.
[02:39:03.575 --> 02:39:03.775]  Yeah.
[02:39:03.995 --> 02:39:12.600]  And so, but we have these bills that are so unbelievably draconian and so Orwellian.
[02:39:12.660 --> 02:39:15.562]  I mean, in America to have the fire inspector be a spy.
[02:39:16.255 --> 02:39:19.596]  Well, you know, we have spies at the banks and other places like that.
[02:39:19.736 --> 02:39:20.617]  Yeah, I know you're a customer.
[02:39:20.637 --> 02:39:22.117]  I mean, is this a free America?
[02:39:22.137 --> 02:39:27.879]  How did we go from land of the free, home of the brave, to all of you are surveilled and controlled unless you're an illegal alien?
[02:39:27.899 --> 02:39:28.080]  Yeah.
[02:39:28.140 --> 02:39:29.100]  And let's shift gears into that.
[02:39:29.700 --> 02:39:42.205]  Well, another way they're absolutely destroying us is that, you know, wherever you go, you have all this, all these cameras on you, all this stuff, and yet we have wide open borders.
[02:39:42.565 --> 02:39:44.446]  Now, is this any new information to your readers?
[02:39:45.386 --> 02:39:48.871]  And 800 plus cities under any name will give any farmer anything they want.
[02:39:49.251 --> 02:39:57.121]  Now the reality is, is that over 85% of the American public are just absolutely calling for
[02:39:58.139 --> 02:39:58.519]  I think?
[02:40:18.811 --> 02:40:20.493]  It is a globalist tool.
[02:40:20.813 --> 02:40:22.014]  I love my country.
[02:40:22.194 --> 02:40:24.196]  I love Mexico, but I love my country.
[02:40:24.556 --> 02:40:27.358]  And here are the cold, hard facts.
[02:40:27.738 --> 02:40:35.804]  If we kept with 1965 quotas for immigration, the population would be about 227 million people.
[02:40:35.824 --> 02:40:37.806]  Today, it's over 300 million.
[02:40:38.126 --> 02:40:40.808]  You know that 49.5% of all children in the U.S.
[02:40:40.848 --> 02:40:41.329]  are foreign-born.
[02:40:49.311 --> 02:40:52.516]  Absolutely, and in California jails right now over 75% of the inmates are illegal immigrants.
[02:40:52.536 --> 02:40:54.038]  But the point is, of that 49%, over 40% are Hispanic.
[02:41:04.572 --> 02:41:13.681]  And then the Hispanic media is trying to get Hispanics to be part of this race thing, and they're saying, we're taking over, you know, the breeding bomb, all this, and then we're not supposed to talk about it.
[02:41:14.001 --> 02:41:22.830]  My whole deal is, it'd be bad enough for the economy, for the social welfare nets, for the cost of government, and the driving down of wages, if they all loved America.
[02:41:22.990 --> 02:41:23.170]  Yeah.
[02:41:23.210 --> 02:41:34.312]  But the problem is, a large portion of them, as they've been taught in public schools, have been taught to hate America, and now half of people under the age of 15 are foreigners, and they don't like the country, and of America.
[02:41:34.332 --> 02:41:36.713]  I mean, it's already basically too far gone.
[02:41:36.733 --> 02:41:38.913]  And friends, this is not about racism.
[02:41:38.933 --> 02:41:40.974]  It's kind of like you shot five times in the head or a hundred times.
[02:41:41.014 --> 02:41:42.814]  Yeah, this is not about racism.
[02:41:42.894 --> 02:41:44.554]  This is about common sense.
[02:41:44.915 --> 02:41:51.876]  And if you talk to any educated Hispanic in Costa Rica, in Mexico, in Guatemala,
[02:41:52.416 --> 02:41:54.917]  They'll say the same thing that Alex and I are saying.
[02:41:54.977 --> 02:42:02.739]  They realize that the power leader or whoever, for example, I was just down in Costa Rica and they shoved down, cafted down the throats of the Costa Ricans.
[02:42:03.119 --> 02:42:09.821]  The educated people down there were just aghast at it, but they bought the votes, they rigged the election, they put it in.
[02:42:10.501 --> 02:42:14.842]  My good friends in Mexico are absolutely disgusted because not only
[02:42:15.422 --> 02:42:20.404]  Do they realize that it is hurting the United States, but they're losing their own country.
[02:42:20.904 --> 02:42:30.148]  I just want the Larry Conquista crowd, who makes up the majority of the foreigners here now, and I want them to know, and I read the writings and I see it, it's all over TV, and it's a big proud thing.
[02:42:30.408 --> 02:42:32.428]  Hey, don't worry, we're going to be like Mexico City now.
[02:42:32.488 --> 02:42:32.969]  You won.
[02:42:32.989 --> 02:42:34.629]  No, we're not going to get that.
[02:42:36.710 --> 02:42:37.651]  Let's not get to that point.
[02:42:37.751 --> 02:42:41.052]  And the New World Order will win and your children will be injected with mercury.
[02:42:41.312 --> 02:42:41.793]  You win.
[02:42:41.873 --> 02:42:42.153]  You win.
[02:42:42.173 --> 02:42:42.733]  You're real tough.
[02:42:42.793 --> 02:42:43.694]  I'm sorry.
[02:42:43.874 --> 02:42:49.997]  And the point is that there are absolute thugs out there who are ignorant.
[02:42:50.337 --> 02:42:52.038]  But that's my point.
[02:42:52.138 --> 02:42:52.358]  I know.
[02:42:52.418 --> 02:42:54.019]  I know.
[02:42:54.199 --> 02:42:56.420]  These people have been taught that they're winning something.
[02:42:56.440 --> 02:42:57.140]  You're not.
[02:42:57.200 --> 02:42:58.541]  You're helping the globalists dominate.
[02:42:58.921 --> 02:43:01.722]  And you're also destroying your own culture.
[02:43:02.162 --> 02:43:12.105]  And supporting your own culture, whether you're an American, or a Canadian, or from Costa Rica, or from Mexico, is a noble and beautiful thing.
[02:43:12.125 --> 02:43:15.946]  That doesn't mean that you don't incorporate the good qualities from other cultures.
[02:43:16.266 --> 02:43:18.307]  But friends, what is going on?
[02:43:18.327 --> 02:43:19.427]  This is destroying all our culture.
[02:43:19.487 --> 02:43:23.829]  Absolute social engineering that is right out in front of us.
[02:43:23.909 --> 02:43:27.330]  And if you can't see it, and if your friends can, and I know that 95%
[02:43:28.470 --> 02:43:28.630]  Well, my
[02:43:51.747 --> 02:43:51.827]  Yes.
[02:44:11.620 --> 02:44:15.061]  I love Canada.
[02:44:15.381 --> 02:44:26.983]  Canada's got oil, they've got gas, they've got timber, they've got hydro, they've got oil, they've got wheat, and they've got a small educated population, and they've gotten control of their socialistic economy.
[02:44:27.543 --> 02:44:32.904]  The loonie's gone from 68 cents to the dollar to a dollar four in the last three years.
[02:44:33.384 --> 02:44:37.445]  Canada is a relatively safe haven.
[02:44:37.465 --> 02:44:38.565]  Now if the real
[02:44:39.545 --> 02:44:40.025]  I think so.
[02:44:57.498 --> 02:45:02.506]  Yes, and quite clearly the Chinese have been very clear.
[02:45:02.566 --> 02:45:12.921]  They have over 1.7 trillion dollars of RT bills, but the Chinese realize that the dollar is going down fast and they have threatened very, very clearly.
[02:45:13.622 --> 02:45:17.405]  Well, let's say instead of them moving out, let's just say that they don't buy anymore.
[02:45:40.883 --> 02:45:49.808]  Now, let's just take a conservative thing, is that what we're talking about is the dollar devaluating another 7 to 15 percent.
[02:45:49.848 --> 02:45:52.629]  Now, again, nobody really knows.
[02:45:52.969 --> 02:46:02.454]  But then if you really see, you know, countries like Russia and Putin, I'll tell you what, if people aren't paying attention to what Putin's saying, you'd better wake up.
[02:46:02.774 --> 02:46:04.215]  The bear is awake.
[02:46:04.255 --> 02:46:08.777]  And I'll tell you what, a lot of the things Putin is saying is pretty direct and honest.
[02:46:09.998 --> 02:46:12.080]  He is calling a spade a spade.
[02:46:12.801 --> 02:46:22.571]  And, you know, I'm not a Russian backer, but I do support him because he's supporting his own country and he's not knuckling down to the power elite.
[02:46:22.611 --> 02:46:27.295]  Well, aren't we seeing a global elite for the first time in modern history start to lose control?
[02:46:28.016 --> 02:46:30.959]  I mean, on every front, including the minds of the people.
[02:46:31.219 --> 02:46:33.602]  When Congress, and I keep talking about this, folks, it's a big deal.
[02:46:34.102 --> 02:46:45.993]  When Congress has an 11% approval rating for the first time in modern history, both parties are discredited, the public doesn't know exactly what the establishment is selling, but they know it's all bull.
[02:46:46.654 --> 02:46:55.342]  And so, now the people are awake that they've been lied to, but they just don't know specifically how they've been lied to and just how severe.
[02:46:55.983 --> 02:46:57.244]  Can you comment on the awakening?
[02:46:58.832 --> 02:47:04.484]  You know, it's kind of like the Clint Eastwood movie, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, but inversely.
[02:47:04.625 --> 02:47:06.468]  We've been talking about the horrible.
[02:47:07.108 --> 02:47:13.253]  But the wonderful, the beautiful happening, or what I call the shift, is taking place.
[02:47:14.014 --> 02:47:22.520]  And, you know, you call it kind of flower power stuff, or whatever you want to call this stuff, is that people are waking up to what's going on.
[02:47:22.661 --> 02:47:26.043]  And this awakening started many, many years ago.
[02:47:26.123 --> 02:47:36.592]  I remember back ten, twelve years ago when we were doing our little shows at Austin Community Access we'd get on, and people thought we were absolutely out of our minds.
[02:47:38.133 --> 02:47:45.018]  Friends of mine would go ballistic on me, and now wherever I go, people are coming up to me and talking to me.
[02:47:45.438 --> 02:47:53.744]  I know well-known billionaires call me up and say they're leaving the country and they know it's all true, and I'm not going to say their names.
[02:47:53.784 --> 02:48:04.211]  And wherever Alex goes, there's still a lot of people who think that we're crackpots, but that number is going down, and as Jesus said, don't cast pearls before swine.
[02:48:04.790 --> 02:48:11.536]  People, now whether you listen to Alex's message or my message or Ron Paul's, we're all saying the same thing.
[02:48:12.056 --> 02:48:14.038]  Wake up, wake up, wake up.
[02:48:14.439 --> 02:48:21.024]  And slowly, it took a while, but now more and more people, and the ball is rolling.
[02:48:21.365 --> 02:48:22.666]  Now quite clearly,
[02:48:23.266 --> 02:48:24.967]  And this is very important, my friends.
[02:48:25.407 --> 02:48:33.853]  We can't beat them, the Power Elite, the Illuminati, whatever you want to call these folks, with guns or with violence.
[02:48:33.873 --> 02:48:37.375]  Let's talk about how we beat them in the final segment with George Humphrey, my good friend.
[02:48:37.395 --> 02:48:38.796]  And we haven't even talked about this yet.
[02:48:39.116 --> 02:48:40.177]  We've got his new book.
[02:48:40.677 --> 02:48:42.698]  That's 9-1-1, The Great Illusion.
[02:48:42.978 --> 02:48:43.819]  We'll tell you about that.
[02:48:43.859 --> 02:48:44.579]  He has a new edition.
[02:48:46.841 --> 02:48:48.242]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:48.262 --> 02:48:50.323]  A new world order.
[02:48:51.070 --> 02:48:55.253]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:55.973 --> 02:48:57.714]  It's known as the Billionaires.
[02:48:58.055 --> 02:49:01.037]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[02:49:01.577 --> 02:49:04.019]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.759 --> 02:49:12.144]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:15.091 --> 02:49:20.093]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.573 --> 02:49:24.055]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:24.415 --> 02:49:26.936]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[02:49:26.976 --> 02:49:27.996]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:28.016 --> 02:49:28.917]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.937 --> 02:49:29.997]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:30.217 --> 02:49:30.858]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.878 --> 02:49:32.018]  That's what they're after usually.

[02:50:45.322 --> 02:50:48.764]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[02:50:49.004 --> 02:50:51.105]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[02:50:51.265 --> 02:50:53.726]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[02:50:53.986 --> 02:50:58.328]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[02:50:58.368 --> 02:50:59.049]  Here's why.
[02:50:59.469 --> 02:51:05.391]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[02:51:05.632 --> 02:51:11.634]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[02:51:11.875 --> 02:51:12.795]  But they're not cheating.
[02:51:13.015 --> 02:51:17.020]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[02:51:17.220 --> 02:51:21.565]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[02:51:21.645 --> 02:51:29.173]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[02:51:29.193 --> 02:51:29.734]  Get control.
[02:51:30.034 --> 02:51:30.575]  Get relief.
[02:51:30.655 --> 02:51:31.355]  Get some sleep.
[02:51:31.455 --> 02:51:34.659]  Go to www.OutIn90.com.
[02:51:34.799 --> 02:51:38.162]  That's www.OutIn90.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:51:38.202 --> 02:51:38.382]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:51:47.851 --> 02:51:49.692]  It's our final segment with George Humphrey.
[02:51:49.752 --> 02:51:56.734]  I just want to encourage everybody to go to PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and get 9-11 The Great Illusion.
[02:51:56.874 --> 02:52:02.836]  Very inexpensive with graphics and photos and documents throughout it on 9-11.
[02:52:04.336 --> 02:52:04.816]  We're good to go.
[02:52:22.029 --> 02:52:22.710]  The new world order.
[02:52:22.730 --> 02:52:28.177]  If we go out, the globals have to stage terror attacks as a pretext to then say we're doing it and go after the American people.
[02:52:28.598 --> 02:52:31.882]  The key is we have to defend ourselves, certainly, but we want to go out and lovingly.
[02:52:32.102 --> 02:52:33.164]  And I get mad myself.
[02:52:33.224 --> 02:52:35.167]  I mean, we're trying to practice this.
[02:52:35.207 --> 02:52:36.188]  I'm not saying I'm good at it.
[02:52:37.193 --> 02:52:37.813]  George is better.
[02:52:37.833 --> 02:52:42.996]  We have to go out and lovingly show them it's in that spirit that they will wake up that, hey, you're being manipulated.
[02:52:43.296 --> 02:52:47.458]  The teachers, the people who work for government, people in corporations, people in companies.
[02:52:47.758 --> 02:52:49.839]  We have to go out and say, listen, we did our research.
[02:52:49.859 --> 02:52:50.659]  This is serious.
[02:52:50.939 --> 02:52:52.360]  We told you all this was going to happen.
[02:52:52.620 --> 02:52:56.382]  It's happening just like we told you it would because we're going off the global stone documents.
[02:52:56.502 --> 02:53:02.565]  Please investigate and realize that it doesn't have to happen this way if people take action.
[02:53:02.805 --> 02:53:03.085]  George,
[02:53:04.147 --> 02:53:05.348]  Well, that's exactly right.
[02:53:05.989 --> 02:53:16.199]  I'm enough of a warrior that every time I get around you or listen to this stuff or read my emails, my blood gets so hot and I want to go after them with an axe.
[02:53:17.361 --> 02:53:20.284]  And at the same time, I've got to make a decision.
[02:53:20.304 --> 02:53:22.726]  I made a decision many years ago.
[02:53:23.267 --> 02:53:26.470]  Do I want to be a martyr or do I want to win this thing?
[02:53:27.535 --> 02:53:35.622]  And quite clearly, I want to win this thing for myself, my family, my community, my state, my country, and the world.
[02:53:35.903 --> 02:53:38.285]  Because this is a worldwide problem.
[02:53:38.905 --> 02:53:45.772]  And if we go out and we get crazy and we just lose our temper, and we do, and if we react with fear,
[02:53:46.633 --> 02:53:49.175]  If we react with fear, we're going to lose.
[02:53:49.756 --> 02:53:51.698]  Because we can't... We have to react with power!
[02:53:52.138 --> 02:53:52.719]  Absolutely.
[02:53:52.819 --> 02:53:53.920]  And dedication.
[02:53:54.160 --> 02:54:04.910]  Now, quite clearly, is that we, the information that we're putting out, even ex-Italian, the ex-Italian president, his name is Francesco Cossiga,
[02:54:05.470 --> 02:54:07.812]  And he was the Italian President for seven years.
[02:54:07.872 --> 02:54:13.216]  He just came out a couple days ago and said that 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:54:13.236 --> 02:54:15.678]  And Robert Baer is saying the evidence points to that.
[02:54:15.778 --> 02:54:17.860]  The information is so overwhelming.
[02:54:18.340 --> 02:54:21.463]  And it is an information war.
[02:54:21.543 --> 02:54:22.544]  So the first step
[02:54:23.268 --> 02:54:23.968]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:54:47.754 --> 02:54:51.537]  But then, because they've been reacting in illusion and fear.
[02:54:51.898 --> 02:54:56.141]  But then, do we shrink away in fear and get angry?
[02:54:56.481 --> 02:54:57.482]  Or what do we do?
[02:54:57.723 --> 02:55:03.748]  Are we pawns or are we sovereign, divine, joyous beings?
[02:55:04.128 --> 02:55:09.853]  And I know that our Creator created us so that we were sovereign and joyful and divine.
[02:55:10.233 --> 02:55:12.895]  And we are not here to be wiped out.
[02:55:13.035 --> 02:55:14.877]  This is an extremely important time.
[02:55:15.277 --> 02:55:16.218]  I go to India.
[02:55:16.518 --> 02:55:19.759]  And the globalists are trying to go into their extermination phase, right?
[02:55:19.799 --> 02:55:20.600]  Well, absolutely.
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:24.601]  The globalists are living in what's called separation consciousness.
[02:55:24.921 --> 02:55:28.043]  They have a vampire type of mentality.
[02:55:28.343 --> 02:55:32.425]  They believe that the only way for their power is to take it from others.
[02:55:33.025 --> 02:55:39.192]  You being a Christian with my spiritual outlook, I realize that there is infinite love out there for all of us.
[02:55:39.212 --> 02:55:40.634]  Well, I believe in the synergy and I know it.
[02:55:40.674 --> 02:55:41.115]  I feel it.
[02:55:41.135 --> 02:55:42.276]  I mean, we were working together.
[02:55:42.596 --> 02:55:43.277]  Absolutely.
[02:55:43.397 --> 02:55:45.019]  Many hands make light work.
[02:55:45.039 --> 02:55:45.740]  George, we're out of time.
[02:55:46.320 --> 02:55:47.402]  It's so good to see you, brother.
[02:55:47.722 --> 02:55:48.482]  Great to see you.

[02:56:12.507 --> 02:56:20.753]  It's so important now to take action in the InfoWars because people are awake now to the point of being able to even listen to what we're saying.
