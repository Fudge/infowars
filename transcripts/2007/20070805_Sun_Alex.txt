[00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:10.218]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio experience like no other.
[00:00:10.298 --> 00:00:13.859]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.121]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:20.062]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:23.303]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:24.263 --> 00:00:27.084]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.300]  Now live from Austin, TX, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.818 --> 00:00:43.159]  Well, welcome.
[00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.020]  Welcome, my friends, to another live Sunday edition.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.441]  Five days a week is not enough for me.
[00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:51.782]  Here I am with this Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:52.282 --> 00:00:54.063]  Every Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:54.143 --> 00:00:55.183]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:55.684 --> 00:01:06.808]  Coming to you via MS Communications and the GCN Radio Network out of the studios of NewsRadio 590, KLVJ, deep in the heart of Texas, syndicated from California to upstate New York.
[00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:09.157]  On the AM and FM dial.
[00:01:09.598 --> 00:01:15.769]  Simultast on three different satellite systems and of course global shortwave WWCR as well.
[00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.918]  And we've got two of the biggest and fastest growing alternative news sites in the world.
[00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:25.310]  Frankly, they're about the biggest alternative news sites in the world now, and I don't even like to say that.
[00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.471]  It's kind of a catch-22.
[00:01:26.531 --> 00:01:30.794]  It's good to tell folks we're winning the Info War, and at the same time, I like to be small-time.
[00:01:30.814 --> 00:01:34.537]  It feels good, actually, to be kind of under the radar, or to have it both ways.
[00:01:34.597 --> 00:01:49.729]  But yes, folks, we're engaging the enemy at point-blank range in the information war, and the websites are PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, JonesReport.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, MartialLaw911.info, ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:01:50.513 --> 00:01:52.615]  And I'm watching several other big ones soon.
[00:01:53.256 --> 00:01:57.260]  We see this as an info war, and the enemy puts out the same propaganda in a hundred flavors.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.244]  We put out our secret weapon, the truth, on many different websites.
[00:02:01.264 --> 00:02:04.307]  It also gives us multi-faceted redundancy.
[00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:06.008]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:02:06.048 --> 00:02:07.250]  We will have open phones.
[00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.292]  I have a surprise guest in the second hour.
[00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:11.714]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:02:12.415 --> 00:02:14.936]  And we'll see if they end up showing up to the program.
[00:02:14.976 --> 00:02:20.738]  I've noticed if it's a what you call adversarial sometimes that it tends to jinx it to talk about it beforehand.
[00:02:21.498 --> 00:02:22.898]  So we'll see what happens in the next hour.
[00:02:22.918 --> 00:02:25.299]  A little surprise perhaps for you.
[00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:32.761]  There is so much news and I was sitting here for about 20 minutes before broadcast time looking at my 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 stacks and I thought
[00:02:35.777 --> 00:02:37.138]  What is most important here?
[00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.299]  And this happens more and more.
[00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.141]  I mean, what should I cover first?
[00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:42.503]  Let me just mention what's in front of me right now.
[00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:46.547]  And again, it is the 5th day of August.
[00:02:46.927 --> 00:02:47.968]  More than half the year's gone.
[00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:50.050]  That's hard to believe.
[00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.332]  2007, August 5th, on this Sunday.
[00:02:52.853 --> 00:02:55.395]  Pentagon to implant microchips in soldiers.
[00:02:55.435 --> 00:02:57.397]  This is directly from the Pentagon.
[00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:03.444]  And not just under their skin, that already happened quietly two years ago to Special Forces and now it's fanning out.
[00:03:03.464 --> 00:03:05.405]  Because I had family it happened to, that's how I knew.
[00:03:05.805 --> 00:03:06.566]  Now it's in the news.
[00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:10.168]  No, in the brains, standard, you'll be getting a brain chip.
[00:03:10.828 --> 00:03:12.589]  You can't make this type of stuff up, folks.
[00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.552]  We're going to be going over that and Clemson University is heading up that report.
[00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:22.475]  Ron Paul is being censored again in front of everyone.
[00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:26.797]  I saw it come out this morning from Free Market News up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.341]  And I sure enough watched it real time.
[00:03:31.242 --> 00:03:36.264]  Ron Paul was thousands and thousands of votes ahead of everybody, getting 45 plus percent of the vote.
[00:03:37.224 --> 00:03:41.506]  And between 10 candidates in this morning's Republican debate.
[00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:45.207]  And then they erased all of his tallies but kept everybody else's.
[00:03:45.247 --> 00:03:47.368]  And then he went ahead again and they erased those.
[00:03:47.388 --> 00:03:48.769]  And he went ahead again and they erased those.
[00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.711]  Everybody went completely ape over this, started calling ABC, emailing them.
[00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:57.252]  And so they stopped it a few hours ago and Ron Paul,
[00:03:58.338 --> 00:04:00.639]  Now, this is 20 minutes ago when I printed this off last.
[00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:08.482]  Ron Paul has 12,675 votes, with the closest person behind him, Mitt Romney, at 2,046.
[00:04:08.862 --> 00:04:14.965]  So, it only lets you vote once per IP, so it's somewhat scientific.
[00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:30.006]  In fact, a lot of evidence in Las Vegas is claiming that these internet polls that Gallup and CNN and everybody else have been having are more scientific than the old Gallup system of calling select little zip codes.
[00:04:30.866 --> 00:04:35.267]  It tends to be old ladies that they've found statistically that will answer polls.
[00:04:35.748 --> 00:04:39.669]  The pollsters know which areas, demographics, which numbers have gotten these responses.
[00:04:40.462 --> 00:04:44.204]  And more and more, the old-line polls are showing to be fraudulent.
[00:04:44.264 --> 00:04:58.731]  Now, you can say that they're fraudulent because of the fact that it is a stale population that is in the old technology grid that they're calling, or you can argue that they're skewing it on purpose, and frankly, I think it's both of them.
[00:04:58.771 --> 00:05:02.373]  Because they say, well, why does Ron Paul win every major poll?
[00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:08.336]  Whether it's on Fox or CNN, when it's an internet or call-in or text poll, where you can only vote once,
[00:05:09.506 --> 00:05:14.288]  But then, he shows up 2-3% in all the other polls.
[00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:16.809]  And that's because you've got two different worlds.
[00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:20.371]  You've got people, on average, there's some really tech-savvy old folks.
[00:05:21.271 --> 00:05:27.314]  You've got some old folks that are, but statistically, people over 65 even, are not as tech-savvy.
[00:05:27.374 --> 00:05:28.995]  They're not getting their news from the net.
[00:05:29.035 --> 00:05:35.097]  They may go on the net and check their bank statement, but they're certainly not on there getting their news, and they're not on there voting.
[00:05:35.578 --> 00:05:36.658]  So you've got two different worlds.
[00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.740]  You've got the new world, and you've got the old world.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.743]  But see, generational shifts don't happen over 20, 30 years like they used to.
[00:05:44.763 --> 00:05:46.043]  They're happening in a couple years now.
[00:05:46.503 --> 00:05:52.706]  I mean, I'm 37 years old, folks, and I'm an old fogey having trouble keeping up with all the technological advances that the young kids are into.
[00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:55.628]  And all of this is going to accelerate.
[00:05:55.648 --> 00:05:57.069]  But look, I'm running out of time here.
[00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.989]  I said I'd get to the news.
[00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:00.970]  We have microchips for the troops' brains.
[00:06:02.611 --> 00:06:04.012]  We have Ron Paul being cheated.
[00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:06.980]  I, uh, turned out they were my listeners.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.183]  This has happened to several people, it turned out, each time we call them to have them on as guests, they're listeners.
[00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:15.567]  Uh, up in North Carolina, arrested for having an upside-down flag flying at their house.
[00:06:16.248 --> 00:06:22.133]  And this guy was out of his jurisdiction and in the military, and now in front of witnesses beat him up and kicked down their door.
[00:06:22.193 --> 00:06:23.254]  He lied and said he didn't.
[00:06:23.574 --> 00:06:27.257]  The sheriff did the right thing and dropped, uh, the assault charges.
[00:06:27.277 --> 00:06:30.020]  Because not only did he beat him up, they then charged him with assault.
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.342]  And the sheriff did the right thing and dropped this.
[00:06:33.848 --> 00:06:40.834]  But we'll talk about where the First Amendment is in this country because it also dovetails with major censorship all across the country.
[00:06:42.436 --> 00:06:48.661]  Just to put it simply, I have a large stack of censorship news from Ron Paul to the web, to police all over the country.
[00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:51.163]  If you've got an upside-down flag in your car, they're arresting you.
[00:06:52.124 --> 00:06:53.325]  And they don't know what it means.
[00:06:53.525 --> 00:06:55.967]  And if you don't know, the country is in crisis.
[00:06:56.248 --> 00:06:59.951]  With the dollar plunging again, another two cents last week, and that is a big deal.
[00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.670]  Ongoing.
[00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.131]  A 58% slide now in value.
[00:07:04.692 --> 00:07:07.193]  And if you don't know what that means, folks, you better figure it out real fast.
[00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:08.634]  With currency devaluation.
[00:07:08.954 --> 00:07:11.796]  Just type it into a search engine and get ready to cry your eyes out.
[00:07:11.856 --> 00:07:12.196]  I know it.
[00:07:12.536 --> 00:07:14.157]  I'm not even a lover of money.
[00:07:14.538 --> 00:07:15.398]  But it's gotten to me.
[00:07:15.458 --> 00:07:17.780]  A little bit of money I got has been turned into toilet paper.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.341]  And there's no sign of it stopping.
[00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:21.702]  Again, I don't know how.
[00:07:22.042 --> 00:07:24.644]  I could talk about that just constantly.
[00:07:24.864 --> 00:07:26.185]  I'd love to talk 10 hours about that.
[00:07:26.925 --> 00:07:27.986]  What else do I have in the news?
[00:07:29.923 --> 00:07:45.676]  In 2001, red-handed, mainstream British papers, no debating it, it was admitted the government launched the foot-and-mouth attack, and then it only killed a few animals, and then they ran around and killed 8 million sheep and 2 million cows, and literally destroyed almost every farm in the country, and the government took them over.
[00:07:47.572 --> 00:07:48.813]  And it was in the mainstream news.
[00:07:48.833 --> 00:07:50.193]  We have flashbacks to that.
[00:07:51.094 --> 00:07:54.055]  They're talking about it spreading to the U.S.
[00:07:54.195 --> 00:07:55.055]  It happened again.
[00:07:55.515 --> 00:07:58.857]  Foot and Mouth has been released in England, and they don't even hide it.
[00:07:58.897 --> 00:08:01.498]  They say the government released it in a drill.
[00:08:02.338 --> 00:08:11.162]  I mean, this is BBC, this is ITAR, TASS, Russian News Agency, this is London Guardian, and of course we broke it, and now they're all admitting it.
[00:08:11.242 --> 00:08:16.024]  Because I have two writers and two webmasters, Paul Watson and Steve Watson, one in London, one in Sheffield.
[00:08:16.465 --> 00:08:17.826]  That's where Robin Hood's from, by the way.
[00:08:19.768 --> 00:08:20.829]  I'm already digressing.
[00:08:21.289 --> 00:08:26.594]  The point is that they've just false flagged us again.
[00:08:27.175 --> 00:08:34.001]  They're going to run around and kill all these animals, and then not let them restock and have all this government regulation, and then in plain view they admit they launched it.
[00:08:35.422 --> 00:08:37.484]  I mean, it's off the chart.
[00:08:38.124 --> 00:08:38.705]  It's off the chart.
[00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:42.976]  I'll explain what bio-agri-terrorism is, okay?
[00:08:43.516 --> 00:08:45.857]  Agricultural terrorism, economic terrorism.
[00:08:45.877 --> 00:08:46.897]  We're going to go over that today.
[00:08:47.197 --> 00:08:48.997]  And again, the government just launches it publicly.
[00:08:49.718 --> 00:08:51.098]  Oh, we launched it!
[00:08:52.658 --> 00:08:53.158]  Every time!
[00:08:54.519 --> 00:09:00.320]  By the way, they have passed martial law provisions from Alabama to Minnesota with foot and mouth.
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.701]  We'll tell you what life will be like if this gets out here.
[00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.191]  Weaponized foot-and-mouth.
[00:09:05.391 --> 00:09:13.435]  By the way, we, in 2002, got a drill with the British military to be held in East Texas cancelled.
[00:09:13.736 --> 00:09:17.097]  Yes, my listeners, you listening right now, you remember it.
[00:09:17.538 --> 00:09:20.259]  We stopped it last time and wanted to launch the attack here.
[00:09:20.919 --> 00:09:27.103]  And I mean, they'll probably launch it here, right in front of us, and I can hold up news articles where they launched it, but they'll still be our saviors on TV.
[00:09:27.183 --> 00:09:31.165]  I mean, now, they just launch attacks in front of everyone, and no one gets in trouble.
[00:09:31.815 --> 00:09:33.616]  And then we'll get into the really serious news.
[00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:35.856]  They just passed total spying on the American people.
[00:09:36.096 --> 00:09:38.497]  And you hear the news, they're completely lying about what it really means.
[00:09:38.897 --> 00:09:42.518]  They've legalized Bush's criminal activities for the last five and a half years.
[00:09:42.578 --> 00:09:45.419]  That's what this spying, eavesdropping bill means.
[00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:46.519]  We'll break it all down.
[00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:47.919]  Also, the murder of Pat Tillman.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.700]  More on that.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.160]  Stay with us!
[00:10:03.368 --> 00:10:03.989]  It's here.
[00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.958]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:10:09.338 --> 00:10:16.971]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:10:17.665 --> 00:10:24.709]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:10:25.129 --> 00:10:36.535]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:10:36.855 --> 00:10:40.357]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:10:40.818 --> 00:10:42.759]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:10:43.079 --> 00:10:46.861]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:11:29.792 --> 00:11:32.234]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[00:11:32.354 --> 00:11:36.798]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders is skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[00:11:37.099 --> 00:11:37.519]  The U.S.
[00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:41.943]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[00:11:42.023 --> 00:11:43.805]  are now seeking safer alternatives.

[00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:54.173]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[00:11:54.273 --> 00:11:54.513]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:11:54.533 --> 00:11:54.733]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:12:01.983 --> 00:12:03.764]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[00:12:04.064 --> 00:12:06.906]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[00:12:07.406 --> 00:12:09.607]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[00:12:10.227 --> 00:12:18.532]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[00:12:19.012 --> 00:12:19.552]  An example?
[00:12:20.093 --> 00:12:22.914]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[00:12:23.815 --> 00:12:26.576]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[00:12:26.956 --> 00:12:30.238]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[00:12:30.996 --> 00:12:36.179]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:38.280]  Money is not the problem.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.501]  Availability is.
[00:12:40.041 --> 00:12:41.902]  Be careful when food supplies get short.
[00:12:42.142 --> 00:12:45.804]  With no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[00:12:46.424 --> 00:12:48.565]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633.
[00:12:48.605 --> 00:12:49.586]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:12:49.606 --> 00:12:49.646]  800-409-5633.
[00:13:01.545 --> 00:13:07.329]  Millions of people suffer daily with back pain, hip pain, leg pain, sciatica, poor posture and more.
[00:13:07.749 --> 00:13:12.893]  How would you like to have a tool to use at home anytime you need to help relieve the pain and not just treat the symptoms?
[00:13:13.533 --> 00:13:19.577]  All of these people are relaxing on a unique device placed under the hips to elevate the sacrum and let tight muscles relax.
[00:13:20.078 --> 00:13:21.639]  It's called the Sacroedgy.
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:28.584]  And was invented by a sports trainer to first help his athletes and now is helping thousands.
[00:13:30.157 --> 00:13:35.541]  The Sacro Wedgie is not a quick fix, but a lifestyle and can even be used sitting at a desk or in the car.
[00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:37.202]  Of course, results will vary.
[00:13:37.402 --> 00:13:40.545]  However, the more balanced you are, the fewer problems you'll have.
[00:13:41.005 --> 00:13:42.766]  Relax 20 minutes daily for release.
[00:13:43.127 --> 00:13:47.710]  It only costs $29.95 for the Sacro Wedgie and $12.95 for the Neck Roll.
[00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.313]  Visit our website at www.sacrowedgie.com or call 1-800-737-9295 for a free brochure.
[00:13:51.333 --> 00:13:52.914]  The Sacro Wedgie works when all else fails.
[00:14:03.705 --> 00:14:06.087]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[00:14:06.167 --> 00:14:07.348]  Well, search no more!
[00:14:07.448 --> 00:14:09.710]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:14:12.132 --> 00:14:15.174]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[00:14:15.954 --> 00:14:18.356]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:20.938 --> 00:14:21.679]  Welcome back.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.063]  So here in the stack in front of me we have the vicious attack on the First Amendment.
[00:14:27.603 --> 00:14:29.645]  The British government, as usual, launching a
[00:14:30.501 --> 00:14:34.142]  If you go back and listen to my radio show in 1996 when this happened,
[00:14:56.618 --> 00:15:01.161]  I was mailed several big industry publications for engineers.
[00:15:02.162 --> 00:15:08.665]  And these were cell phone tower engineer magazines, specialty manuals.
[00:15:09.346 --> 00:15:15.029]  These were also other publications inside the telecommunications industry about complying with new regulations.
[00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:16.750]  Now, these were not laws.
[00:15:17.791 --> 00:15:21.373]  This was a regulation for corporate America.
[00:15:22.498 --> 00:15:27.139]  And then only do we see now ten, eleven years later do they implement.
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:44.225]  Now the law stated they were going to pay five billion dollars at the time, turned out being almost ten billion, to pay every major phone company in the nation and every hub and every cell tower and every system to have NSA wiring put in where everything passes through the NSA first.
[00:15:44.905 --> 00:15:45.405]  Let me explain.
[00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:48.406]  The phone companies have whole floors that are NSA.
[00:15:49.648 --> 00:16:02.581]  And I got on air, and I read this, and I covered it, and I talked about it, I gave the documentation, and then remember last year, oh my gosh, a whole floor in San Francisco at AT&T, everything's wired through it!
[00:16:05.222 --> 00:16:11.243]  You know, we're just now hearing about how everything for emergency takeover of radio, TV, and cable is now controlled by FEMA and Homeland Security.
[00:16:11.283 --> 00:16:20.846]  No, back in 97, it was made regulatory policy that everything in radio stations, the final piece is the FEMA takeover, EAS boxes.
[00:16:20.866 --> 00:16:21.926]  I mean, I saw it be put in.
[00:16:22.886 --> 00:16:28.107]  Now they're telling radio stations, hey, the government's going to pop in and have little announcements too, not just during a nuclear attack.
[00:16:28.127 --> 00:16:30.028]  But we're going to take over some programming now.
[00:16:30.328 --> 00:16:31.868]  See, we're going into fascism.
[00:16:32.088 --> 00:16:33.969]  See, I'm seeing all the infrastructure go in.
[00:16:35.524 --> 00:16:44.468]  You can make something secret, but they have to fund, and they have to have the industry put in the apparatchik for this, and there was nothing secret about it.
[00:16:44.928 --> 00:16:46.128]  Everything is listened to.
[00:16:46.148 --> 00:16:47.249]  Let me give you a news flash.
[00:16:47.309 --> 00:16:51.050]  Every major AM FM transmission goes through the NSA, okay?
[00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.711]  And the key word computers listen to it for at least 25 years.
[00:16:54.292 --> 00:16:58.693]  I mean, radio going back 50, but that was with people in interceptical at the last 25 with key word.
[00:16:58.774 --> 00:17:01.014]  Remember, they're about 25 years ahead of us as well in many cases.
[00:17:01.415 --> 00:17:02.295]  This is all admitted now.
[00:17:02.841 --> 00:17:05.822]  Because I'm not going to just sit here and talk about what they did and read the AP.
[00:17:05.842 --> 00:17:07.163]  I mean, this is literal theater.
[00:17:07.603 --> 00:17:08.223]  Go read the bill.
[00:17:08.263 --> 00:17:09.384]  This is not what's going on.
[00:17:09.624 --> 00:17:11.745]  The lazy AP writer doesn't know how to read law.
[00:17:12.185 --> 00:17:12.925]  They're not a scholar.
[00:17:12.945 --> 00:17:13.846]  They haven't studied this.
[00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:17.888]  And they just hear, oh, this is so we can crack foreign phone calls into the U.S.
[00:17:17.928 --> 00:17:21.289]  You know, you watch the Senate hearings, the truth comes out.
[00:17:21.629 --> 00:17:32.454]  This is legalizing, remember you heard it was illegal, the Supreme Court ruled it was illegal, what Bush has been doing to keep us safe from Al-Qaeda, I mean Al-Qaeda, the last five and a half years?
[00:17:33.354 --> 00:17:35.635]  And he had to do it to keep us safe, but it was illegal?
[00:17:36.636 --> 00:17:38.317]  I mean, the FISA court was blank checks.
[00:17:38.337 --> 00:17:43.640]  They just sign a blank form and twenty, thirty thousand people could be spied on randomly just with that.
[00:17:43.961 --> 00:17:46.062]  They said, no, we don't even want that domestically.
[00:17:46.282 --> 00:17:49.824]  Just blank checks for, you know, ten state regions, do whatever we want.
[00:17:50.164 --> 00:17:50.525]  Literally.
[00:17:53.006 --> 00:17:55.168]  So, now it's just pell-mell.
[00:17:55.208 --> 00:18:00.311]  They had to have Congress pass this so what they've already been doing forever would, quote, be legal and lawful.
[00:18:01.084 --> 00:18:07.668]  Remember, Congress and the Supreme Court said black people weren't human beings until, you know, for the first hundred plus years of this country.
[00:18:09.249 --> 00:18:16.412]  And so, we need to understand that just because they now say that doesn't mean that it trumps the Bill of Rights, Constitution, and common sense.
[00:18:16.733 --> 00:18:19.754]  They can pass laws right now that you've got to throw your children off cliffs.
[00:18:20.034 --> 00:18:21.875]  We don't have to follow it.
[00:18:22.276 --> 00:18:22.956]  It's unlawful.
[00:18:23.316 --> 00:18:24.217]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:18:24.397 --> 00:18:26.438]  It goes against common law, common sense.
[00:18:27.156 --> 00:18:27.756]  God's laws.
[00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:28.736]  It's real simple.
[00:18:28.776 --> 00:18:29.897]  You know right and wrong, folks.
[00:18:30.117 --> 00:18:30.877]  You have a conscience.
[00:18:30.897 --> 00:18:33.078]  Unless you're so given over to evil you don't have it anymore.
[00:18:33.218 --> 00:18:34.998]  So, I digress.
[00:18:35.758 --> 00:18:36.398]  I do digress.
[00:18:36.458 --> 00:18:36.938]  I'm sorry.
[00:18:38.499 --> 00:18:44.100]  The point is, they said not just all these snooping systems and not just cell phone triangulation down to 15 feet.
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.761]  Your phone doesn't have GPS.
[00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:46.861]  Though some now are getting it.
[00:18:47.121 --> 00:18:48.541]  Your phone doesn't have it by law.
[00:18:48.841 --> 00:18:53.002]  What it has is triangulation with GPS on the cell towers down to 15 feet.
[00:18:53.022 --> 00:18:54.963]  And they're really gauged down to about two and a half feet.
[00:18:56.406 --> 00:19:03.853]  And I remember about two or three years ago, I was at a funeral for my step-grandfather up in Fort Worth, and we were lost.
[00:19:04.193 --> 00:19:05.654]  We'd gone to see a museum, me and my dad.
[00:19:07.416 --> 00:19:09.658]  And we were going to be there early, and we were lost.
[00:19:10.258 --> 00:19:14.202]  And I just said, hey dad, with your cell phone, call and ask them to tell them where you're at.
[00:19:14.322 --> 00:19:16.844]  And they'll tell you exactly where the street is you're looking for.
[00:19:16.864 --> 00:19:17.745]  And he said, it doesn't do that.
[00:19:17.785 --> 00:19:18.606]  I said, just call.
[00:19:19.162 --> 00:19:25.027]  And he called before the service had really even been announced and they said, OK, yeah, this is the this is the owner of the phone.
[00:19:25.047 --> 00:19:25.688]  Give us your code.
[00:19:25.708 --> 00:19:26.168]  All right.
[00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:28.330]  Well, yeah, you should be coming up on Maine right now.
[00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.051]  Oh, there it is.
[00:19:29.071 --> 00:19:31.913]  Well, you just turn three streets over and you go here and then you'll be able to funeral.
[00:19:33.158 --> 00:19:36.321]  And then I saw the Governor of Wisconsin put it in a few years ago.
[00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:39.283]  Now the FEMA emergency centers all have it.
[00:19:39.983 --> 00:19:45.307]  You know it locally as the Threat Integration Center, Emergency Management Center, or Tri-County Area.
[00:19:46.148 --> 00:19:47.689]  Big cities have it for themselves.
[00:19:47.749 --> 00:19:49.871]  Counties will have it in a four, five, or three county area.
[00:19:50.527 --> 00:19:54.049]  And now they announce, ooh, we can type in your name and track your cell phone.
[00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.231]  And cops are doing this from New York to Dallas.
[00:19:56.431 --> 00:19:58.332]  I don't think Austin has it yet.
[00:19:58.352 --> 00:20:00.053]  I'm told they're getting the software, though.
[00:20:00.134 --> 00:20:02.375]  And FEMA then announces, now you have this.
[00:20:02.435 --> 00:20:05.397]  And you just type in Alexander Emmerich Jones with the phone number.
[00:20:05.697 --> 00:20:06.758]  Oh, there he is.
[00:20:06.858 --> 00:20:07.438]  OK.
[00:20:07.859 --> 00:20:09.580]  He's down at KLBJ Studios right now.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.280]  And that's freedom.
[00:20:10.821 --> 00:20:12.642]  No judge, no jury, no nothing.
[00:20:13.222 --> 00:20:17.065]  Type into Google, cities now using cell phones to track traffic.
[00:20:17.245 --> 00:20:19.206]  So they can dial in and follow all the cell phones.
[00:20:19.246 --> 00:20:20.247]  And oh, it's for traffic.
[00:20:20.767 --> 00:20:20.987]  No.
[00:20:21.387 --> 00:20:45.918]  The NSA took over completely in 1996 and by 2001 all cell phone companies had to have it fully in control by law that all the new cell phones and many of them adopted before that had to have it in them where they can dial in even when you turn the phone off and now they put it in even if you remove the battery almost and they have an internal battery and the FBI can listen.
[00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:46.859]  Okay.
[00:20:47.705 --> 00:20:52.267]  Now, Google also brags that they tune in and listen, but have keyword computers see what products you like.
[00:20:53.007 --> 00:20:54.608]  Folks, I can't make this stuff up, okay?
[00:20:55.188 --> 00:21:03.331]  Now, for those that don't believe me, here is your God, Fox News, giggling and snickering and laughing four months ago.
[00:21:03.351 --> 00:21:07.973]  You see, they do it years after it's in force, years after it's in place, they then tell you.
[00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:11.334]  Like, you've had a national ID card since the mid-1990s.
[00:21:11.774 --> 00:21:14.135]  Now, they're telling you it's coming next year.
[00:21:14.913 --> 00:21:16.414]  Okay, it's not for the illegals.
[00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:18.236]  It's for you, not for them, by the way.
[00:21:18.476 --> 00:21:19.657]  And they tell you it's for the illegals.
[00:21:19.997 --> 00:21:21.819]  Okay, and I have, again, I made films about this in 97.
[00:21:21.939 --> 00:21:24.121]  Now, because I have executive orders.
[00:21:24.381 --> 00:21:25.322]  How do I know it's going to happen?
[00:21:25.442 --> 00:21:26.963]  I have the very blueprints.
[00:21:27.283 --> 00:21:29.525]  Then they have these bills just for public consumption.
[00:21:29.825 --> 00:21:31.587]  There's the real world, there's the spin world.
[00:21:31.867 --> 00:21:33.168]  We tell you about the real world.
[00:21:33.408 --> 00:21:36.051]  Here is Fox telling you how great it is you're being spied on.
[00:21:38.012 --> 00:21:43.237]  And it's just so wonderful and fabulous and we just need to all go along with it.
[00:21:43.277 --> 00:21:43.737]  Is it rolling?
[00:21:46.787 --> 00:21:47.868]  Oh, we're about to go to break.
[00:21:47.908 --> 00:21:48.849]  I didn't get a signal.
[00:21:48.869 --> 00:21:51.150]  Okay, when we get back, we'll play it.
[00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.272]  It's only a 50-second clip, though.
[00:21:54.292 --> 00:21:54.813]  Can we roll it?
[00:21:54.833 --> 00:22:07.001]  We had time to roll it, though.
[00:22:07.021 --> 00:22:07.782]  Oh, the computer.
[00:22:07.802 --> 00:22:08.202]  That's what it is.
[00:22:08.242 --> 00:22:08.502]  Alright.
[00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:16.108]  When we get back, we will roll that piece and go over it for you so you can hear.
[00:22:16.869 --> 00:22:21.650]  Fox News, for yourself, openly admit all of this.
[00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:22.471]  Okay?
[00:22:23.031 --> 00:22:27.332]  Tuning in via your cell phones, whenever they want.
[00:22:28.772 --> 00:22:33.694]  And then Google says, oh, we're going to use the video and microphone in your computer.
[00:22:33.914 --> 00:22:36.974]  They said this about eight months ago, to watch and view everything you're doing.
[00:22:37.675 --> 00:22:42.176]  So, we'll be right back after this quick break, blasting out coast-to-coast and nationwide.
[00:22:42.196 --> 00:22:42.516]  Stay with us.
[00:23:00.412 --> 00:23:02.053]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[00:23:02.353 --> 00:23:09.739]  Thanks to a quantum leap in garlic research, the health benefits of 20 fresh garlic cloves are now available in one tiny capsule.
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:17.706]  With stabilized allicin, the proven power of garlic has been transformed into what is perhaps the most important medicinal product ever developed.
[00:23:17.886 --> 00:23:18.967]  And there's no odor.
[00:23:19.187 --> 00:23:29.197]  Stabilized Allicin gives you and your family a safe, natural weapon that kills harmful bacteria, viruses, and funguses, all without harming the friendly bacteria in the digestive tract.
[00:23:29.277 --> 00:23:37.524]  This means strong immunity, fewer and shorter colds, and the best possible protection from deadly diseases, none of which prescription drugs can offer.
[00:23:37.785 --> 00:23:43.350]  What's more, this product can deter mosquitoes from biting you and safely keep fleas and ticks off your pets.
[00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:52.233]  For more information, visit Garlic, the number 4, yourheart.com, or click on the banner at GCMLive.com, or call Amy personally at 805-595-2711.
[00:23:52.253 --> 00:23:52.553]  That's 805-595-2711.
[00:24:02.609 --> 00:24:07.111]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:24:07.451 --> 00:24:11.533]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:24:11.853 --> 00:24:12.373]  We listened.
[00:24:12.693 --> 00:24:17.675]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:24:17.935 --> 00:24:18.415]  We listened.
[00:24:18.816 --> 00:24:21.837]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:24:22.277 --> 00:24:22.817]  We listened.
[00:24:23.277 --> 00:24:27.039]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:24:27.139 --> 00:24:27.780]  We're good.
[00:24:43.693 --> 00:24:46.335]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[00:24:46.535 --> 00:24:46.715]  Only $279.
[00:24:46.755 --> 00:24:47.375]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:24:47.415 --> 00:24:47.655]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:24:49.396 --> 00:24:50.317]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:24:59.785 --> 00:25:03.387]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:25:03.628 --> 00:25:04.528]  Look no further!
[00:25:04.808 --> 00:25:07.390]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:16.316]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.

[00:25:18.217 --> 00:25:18.837]  I think so.
[00:25:34.048 --> 00:25:34.308]  I'm good.
[00:25:59.435 --> 00:26:04.920]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.584]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:26:10.024 --> 00:26:16.870]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:24.014]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:26:24.334 --> 00:26:25.955]  There are no reported side effects.
[00:26:26.255 --> 00:26:29.437]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:26:29.717 --> 00:26:32.158]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[00:26:46.406 --> 00:26:48.107]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[00:26:48.147 --> 00:26:49.747]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:26:49.767 --> 00:26:50.888]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:19.903]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:27:22.605 --> 00:27:23.745]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:27:26.187 --> 00:27:33.049]  We will be taking some calls a little bit later in the show at 877-590-5525, 877-590-KLBJ for the namesake mothership station we're broadcasting out of.
[00:27:33.089 --> 00:27:39.031]  The syndicated program comes out of these studios on News Radio 590-KLBJ every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:42.431]  Central, 5 to 7 Eastern, 836-0590 if you're a local listener.
[00:27:42.451 --> 00:27:43.352]  Now, as I was saying,
[00:27:52.928 --> 00:28:00.871]  I've been telling people since 1996 that most cell phones already had this, and I told you in 2001 when it was, then did become law, not just regulation.
[00:28:04.192 --> 00:28:04.712]  This is how it works.
[00:28:04.752 --> 00:28:07.192]  They paid to put it all in in 1996.
[00:28:07.273 --> 00:28:07.713]  Okay?
[00:28:09.013 --> 00:28:13.594]  And then it became law that everybody had to have it by 2001, October 1st.
[00:28:13.614 --> 00:28:16.315]  This is six years before that this was grandfathered in.
[00:28:17.376 --> 00:28:21.557]  So, let's go ahead now and go to this Fox News piece where they throw it in your face.
[00:28:22.668 --> 00:28:25.310]  Alright, here's that cell phone story you've been waiting for.
[00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.253]  Cell phone users beware, Big Brother may be listening.
[00:28:28.753 --> 00:28:35.259]  The Federal Bureau of Investigation can now hear everything you say, even when the cell phone is turned off.
[00:28:35.459 --> 00:28:46.568]  I know, it sounds kinda out there, but using your phone's tracking device, authorities can now activate the microphone inside the dreaded thing, allowing them to eavesdrop on you and your conversations.
[00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:49.911]  So we've decided to start saying all kinds of weird stuff all the time.
[00:28:50.672 --> 00:28:51.112]  Not really.
[00:28:51.633 --> 00:28:59.257]  Serious business, and the FBI used this form of surveillance to keep tabs on critical conversations by people they call known members of the Mafia.
[00:28:59.918 --> 00:29:03.720]  Experts say the only way around it is to take the battery out of the thing.
[00:29:05.461 --> 00:29:10.944]  Alright, now there's Shepard Smith, and I've got so many clips of him going, Big brother, eat your heart out.
[00:29:10.964 --> 00:29:12.325]  We're spying for your safety.
[00:29:12.625 --> 00:29:16.868]  This is serious business to keep you safe and fight against Al Qaeda.
[00:29:17.746 --> 00:29:25.293]  And in 1996, we had it designed into the entire regulatory infrastructure of all cell phones and cell phone devices.
[00:29:26.974 --> 00:29:28.796]  Including your OnStar and everything else.
[00:29:30.043 --> 00:29:37.927]  And then I told you about that years ago, and sure enough, I got criticized, and now it's been in the news, that without warrants, they just dial in on your OnStar, and just listen to you.
[00:29:37.947 --> 00:29:40.548]  And you go, well, fine, I ain't got nothing to hide!
[00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:43.009]  Well, the government's got a lot to hide from you.
[00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:48.252]  I mean, they're engaged in every type of criminal activity you can imagine, and probably some we haven't imagined.
[00:29:50.911 --> 00:30:19.980]  Then you hear a story like this, Senate votes to expand, he's driving power, Bill matches what Bush requested, Democratic version, fails in the House, and that was earlier yesterday, not earlier on Friday, it did pass the House, and now President Bush just signed it about an hour and a half ago at Camp David where he's there enjoying himself, posing as the Commander-in-Chief and posing as a conservative and doing a great job bringing the country down for his foreign banker owners.
[00:30:21.104 --> 00:30:22.665]  Again, Bush runs absolutely nothing.
[00:30:24.487 --> 00:30:26.889]  Except a lot of your brains out there who thinks he's running something.
[00:30:26.969 --> 00:30:28.070]  So, here it is.
[00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:29.451]  House passes eavesdropping bill.
[00:30:29.511 --> 00:30:33.834]  The House handed President Bush a victory Saturday, voting to expand.
[00:30:33.854 --> 00:30:35.596]  Why, they stayed in session to give it to you.
[00:30:35.976 --> 00:30:41.541]  The government's ability to eavesdrop without warrants on foreign suspects whose communications pass through the United States.
[00:30:42.361 --> 00:30:43.222]  The vote was 227 to 183.
[00:30:43.342 --> 00:30:44.743]  Now, if you actually go and read the bill,
[00:30:49.523 --> 00:30:50.523]  It does not say that.
[00:30:50.563 --> 00:30:52.864]  It says they can spy on people domestically without warrants.
[00:30:53.705 --> 00:30:57.946]  Which they've already been doing, and they got in a lot of trouble because it was criminal.
[00:30:58.007 --> 00:31:07.730]  So basically they got caught engaging in a crime, so now they went back and have the Senate and the House pass it saying, okay, well now retroactively, and by the way the bill does that, you're allowed to do these things.
[00:31:08.031 --> 00:31:10.752]  So all these lawsuits can be forced to be dropped.
[00:31:11.852 --> 00:31:13.713]  Keeping us safe from Al Qaeda, of course.
[00:31:14.967 --> 00:31:16.809]  And if you believe that, I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
[00:31:17.289 --> 00:31:24.934]  In 2004, they passed a new law dealing with, well it was a new regulation, it became law, what, last Wednesday.
[00:31:25.875 --> 00:31:29.718]  It's always a regulation first as they phase it in, and then a law a few years later.
[00:31:29.978 --> 00:31:44.368]  And that is, every prescription, I don't care if it's a prosthesis, a diaphragm, prescription, ibuprofen, it doesn't matter what it is, the minute you get it, at all pharmacies, the minute you get it,
[00:31:44.984 --> 00:31:47.124]  It is instantly uploaded to the federal government.
[00:31:47.665 --> 00:31:56.246]  And I remember when I was watching CNN, they were going, President Bush signs new regulations that keep your information private.
[00:31:57.026 --> 00:31:58.606]  They called it a privacy bill.
[00:32:01.167 --> 00:32:08.548]  I guess if you've got a house that's glass, and your shower's glass on the top floor for all the neighbors to see, you can call that a privacy shower.
[00:32:09.728 --> 00:32:12.649]  Or I guess at the airport, those federally systems they put in the
[00:32:13.456 --> 00:32:20.099]  The infrared slash radar systems that look through your clothes and videotape your naked body call that a privacy scan.
[00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:21.139]  Of course they do.
[00:32:21.479 --> 00:32:24.841]  A lot of airports now have it and they save your images of your naked body.
[00:32:24.881 --> 00:32:25.341]  It's freedom!
[00:32:26.061 --> 00:32:30.743]  And thousands of schools that we've seen have cameras in the bathrooms, not just... Yes, thousands.
[00:32:31.443 --> 00:32:32.804]  In the UK, the US, and Canada.
[00:32:33.642 --> 00:32:36.304]  Hundreds and hundreds, I've seen in the newspapers, each time it happens, there's a little article.
[00:32:36.344 --> 00:32:39.706]  Well, the camera's not exactly in the urinal, but it aims at the urinal.
[00:32:39.726 --> 00:32:46.249]  So, well, the mayor has said that the police chief will not have it directly over the toilet.
[00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:47.990]  That was a little bad.
[00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:52.673]  Now, they'll just have it into the stall, but not directly on the toilet.
[00:32:52.693 --> 00:32:53.594]  Just go search it out.
[00:32:53.634 --> 00:32:55.795]  It's all over the web, all the mainstream news, how good it is.
[00:32:57.188 --> 00:33:06.057]  That was one case in Tennessee, though, where people were normal and the middle school girls came to play basketball and after the game they were taking a shower and they saw a camera in the shower and freaked out.
[00:33:06.297 --> 00:33:09.900]  Ran out screaming, there was parents freaking out and fights breaking out in the parking lot.
[00:33:10.441 --> 00:33:13.083]  And the principal came out and said, What's the big deal?
[00:33:13.104 --> 00:33:14.925]  Of course there's a camera in the shower.
[00:33:15.286 --> 00:33:16.347]  Aren't you normal?
[00:33:17.568 --> 00:33:21.692]  See how it's all just completely out in the open now?
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.961]  See, I mean, just overwhelmed to the max.
[00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:26.262]  Cameras in the toilets.
[00:33:26.542 --> 00:33:28.003]  Cameras in the showers.
[00:33:29.524 --> 00:33:31.706]  Feds listening to your cell phones with no warrant.
[00:33:31.986 --> 00:33:34.768]  No warrant every prescription you get instantly uploaded.
[00:33:34.948 --> 00:33:36.149]  Where's the Fourth Amendment there?
[00:33:36.349 --> 00:33:37.450]  Where's the Fifth Amendment there?
[00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:38.651]  Where's the Tenth Amendment?
[00:33:38.671 --> 00:33:39.371]  State's rights there.
[00:33:39.391 --> 00:33:40.232]  That's a state issue.
[00:33:41.533 --> 00:33:41.793]  You see?
[00:33:42.535 --> 00:33:44.456]  I mean, they're not following anything.
[00:33:44.636 --> 00:33:50.418]  Then they have some discussion about, well, this allows the President to listen to phone calls from Ben Laden.
[00:33:51.539 --> 00:33:52.619]  That's how politicians push it.
[00:33:52.939 --> 00:33:54.680]  I think that's reasonable.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:34:01.043]  And Johnny Six-Pack and Sally Shocker, Mom, driving along, they don't know their head from a hole in the ground.
[00:34:01.741 --> 00:34:05.764]  They don't know what a 57% reduction in the value of the dollar means.
[00:34:06.144 --> 00:34:11.207]  They don't know where Iraq is on a map, but they sure know they want it to be a glass parking lot.
[00:34:11.508 --> 00:34:13.589]  They know how to say parking lot.
[00:34:14.201 --> 00:34:16.121]  Well, it's your bank account that's going to be a parking lot.
[00:34:16.301 --> 00:34:18.062]  It's your freedoms that are going to be a parking lot.
[00:34:18.242 --> 00:34:27.763]  When you've got a criminal elite running your country, and engaging in genocide all over the planet, and running the currency, and the national sovereignty of the ground, you're going to get stepped on, too!
[00:34:27.963 --> 00:34:29.584]  Just like Germans did under Hitler!
[00:34:29.784 --> 00:34:31.964]  Just like Russians did under Stalin, you twits!
[00:34:32.524 --> 00:34:33.284]  You fools!
[00:34:33.624 --> 00:34:42.126]  It's mainstream news now, every day, that, well, Bush is basically a dictator, and Congress isn't involved now in continuity of government, the President gave himself the new power,
[00:34:43.641 --> 00:34:52.658]  In early May, I mean mainstream news, there's articles pro-Bush saying, well, he now does have the powers, that's what he needs.
[00:34:56.063 --> 00:35:03.246]  And then a condescending, you-know-what-Eaton-Grin comment from Shepard Smith.
[00:35:03.306 --> 00:35:05.407]  Well, we joke around about it.
[00:35:07.488 --> 00:35:10.289]  By the way, my script was written by Pentagon psych warfare experts.
[00:35:11.329 --> 00:35:12.730]  Literally, that's what's come out in the news today.
[00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:13.911]  CNN and Fox.
[00:35:14.211 --> 00:35:16.353]  I mean, it's not some liberal or conservative bias.
[00:35:16.633 --> 00:35:17.954]  It's top psychiatrist!
[00:35:18.295 --> 00:35:19.696]  It's top sociologist!
[00:35:20.016 --> 00:35:22.098]  We're deciding how to destroy your mind!
[00:35:22.478 --> 00:35:23.059]  How to sell you.
[00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:23.759]  How do we sell this?
[00:35:24.099 --> 00:35:25.461]  Well, you have them just joke around about it.
[00:35:25.481 --> 00:35:26.862]  Every day, there's a little Big Brother section.
[00:35:27.102 --> 00:35:27.823]  It's always good.
[00:35:27.903 --> 00:35:28.163]  Ha ha!
[00:35:28.423 --> 00:35:28.843]  Ha ha!
[00:35:28.963 --> 00:35:29.744]  It's fun!
[00:35:30.485 --> 00:35:31.546]  Oh, but let's get serious.
[00:35:31.866 --> 00:35:33.788]  This keeps you safe from El Cato.
[00:35:34.568 --> 00:35:36.630]  Oh, keeps you safe from El Cato.
[00:35:38.311 --> 00:35:40.093]  I mean, I have had enough of this.
[00:35:41.112 --> 00:35:44.115]  And I've had enough of being talked down to like I'm a fool.
[00:35:46.358 --> 00:35:52.925]  Now, we're going to come back and get in a few calls from Greg and others that are patiently holding there on the line.
[00:35:54.827 --> 00:35:58.571]  It says, foot and mouth virus released from government lab.
[00:35:59.324 --> 00:36:06.671]  Case mirrors 2001 outbreak could signal new wave of agro-terrorism against farming community.
[00:36:07.152 --> 00:36:16.000]  Russian news agency ITAR-TASS is reporting that the release of the virus came after an international drill last month that was held at
[00:36:18.354 --> 00:36:21.315]  Pergebrank Laboratory in which live virus was used.
[00:36:21.735 --> 00:36:25.816]  Middle attacks are always shadowed by drills to provide cobalt viability.
[00:36:26.036 --> 00:36:28.397]  And the article continues, and we have mainstream links.
[00:36:28.917 --> 00:36:35.859]  Now they go, well, the Governor released it, but they're going to save us now by taking over your farms and ranches.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:41.281]  I don't know, but I'm feeling like I want to sing God Save the Queen and the Prince.
[00:36:42.001 --> 00:36:46.863]  The problem here is they've passed martial law contingencies here in the U.S.
[00:36:46.883 --> 00:36:47.223]  for this.
[00:36:48.616 --> 00:36:50.997]  So we'll talk about that when we get back after some calls.
[00:36:51.018 --> 00:36:51.618]  Stay with us.
[00:36:51.718 --> 00:36:52.739]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:37:00.563 --> 00:37:09.048]  Did you know that we ingest toxins and harsh chemicals every day from the foods and alcohol we consume, the water we drink, and the OTCs and prescription medications we take?
[00:37:09.308 --> 00:37:15.492]  Thankfully, our liver neutralizes the effects of these toxins and eliminates them from our bodies before they can do too much damage.
[00:37:15.612 --> 00:37:15.952]  I think so.
[00:37:32.638 --> 00:37:32.718]  Yes!
[00:38:04.193 --> 00:38:05.997]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[00:38:06.497 --> 00:38:08.281]  Sure, you've got a mortgage and credit cards.
[00:38:08.581 --> 00:38:11.727]  Your debt creation is probably the smartest thing you've ever done.
[00:38:11.747 --> 00:38:13.811]  How would it be to find $75, $150, $200,000 or more you never knew you had?
[00:38:17.165 --> 00:38:21.588]  Now the task force has strategies to make these debts into virtual savings accounts.
[00:38:22.148 --> 00:38:24.490]  Ben Franklin said, a penny saved is a penny earned.
[00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:33.556]  By doing nothing more than you're doing right now, because you've used your credit, the right strategies can make the debt part of your financial life the smartest thing you've ever done.
[00:38:34.096 --> 00:38:36.818]  Oh, by the way, your strategies cost you nothing out of pocket.
[00:38:37.459 --> 00:38:40.241]  Go ahead and check out the debt elimination scams if you'd like to.
[00:38:40.761 --> 00:38:45.224]  You wouldn't take money from a loan shark, so you may not want to give your money to a debt shark

[00:39:04.169 --> 00:39:07.030]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:13.452]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[00:40:12.118 --> 00:40:14.398]  The average savings for generic drugs was over 71%.

[00:41:05.865 --> 00:41:06.806]  We've got you covered.
[00:41:06.866 --> 00:41:12.169]  You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[00:41:14.771 --> 00:41:20.394]  ...from the capital of Texas, broadcasting the truth coast to coast and worldwide.
[00:41:20.894 --> 00:41:23.216]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:41:25.217 --> 00:41:28.599]  Alright, back live in the cockpit, ready to roll.
[00:41:30.564 --> 00:41:32.305]  I got my Bombardier in there.
[00:41:32.325 --> 00:41:33.885]  Just gotta drop those bombs.
[00:41:34.645 --> 00:41:36.766]  Those info weapons when we get over the target.
[00:41:36.846 --> 00:41:41.027]  When I say pull the lever, we will destroy more enemy propaganda.
[00:41:43.648 --> 00:41:44.108]  All right.
[00:41:44.728 --> 00:41:48.169]  Let me get into Ron Paul while he was censured coming up in the next hour by ABC News.
[00:41:48.189 --> 00:41:52.010]  This is very important because it's an ongoing pattern that gets more and more revealing.
[00:41:53.327 --> 00:42:03.417]  We'll also get into all this eavesdropping and spying and the Big Brother society we're living in and how we're now being acclimated and basically indoctrinated using psychological warfare by the enemy.
[00:42:04.498 --> 00:42:07.280]  We'll get into how the government of England has now again released foot and mouth.
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:11.604]  Will this bioweapon repeat the carnage of 2001?
[00:42:12.165 --> 00:42:14.006]  Also, American Al-Qaeda leader says U.S.
[00:42:14.066 --> 00:42:15.027]  Embassy is a prime target.
[00:42:15.268 --> 00:42:17.470]  This is the guy who's the son of one of the heads of the ADL.
[00:42:19.375 --> 00:42:35.370]  This is the guy who clearly is, I mean, this is such a government op, and it's come out this week, they put out new fake Bin Laden and fake Zarqawi videos, and it turns out that the watermark was put on there at the same time the Al Qaeda mark was, they've had Wired Magazine's top computer specialist look at it, and it's fake.
[00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:45.199]  I mean, this isn't even coming out in Wired Magazine, folks, and they don't care, they just, they know the general public literally doesn't know the difference between a Shiite or a Sunni or where Iraq is on a map, so why not just lie to you?
[00:42:46.647 --> 00:42:50.350]  And no, I'm not saying there aren't some real Muslim terrorists or people out there that don't like us.
[00:42:50.931 --> 00:42:56.375]  The point is that it's way overblown and most of the time if it's a big event, it's the good old New World Order behind it.
[00:42:57.496 --> 00:42:59.718]  Let's go ahead and take some calls though, as promised.
[00:42:59.818 --> 00:43:03.160]  Let's go ahead first to Steve in South Africa.
[00:43:03.961 --> 00:43:06.883]  Steve calling from South Africa.
[00:43:06.963 --> 00:43:07.864]  You're on the air.
[00:43:07.904 --> 00:43:08.405]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:43:11.387 --> 00:43:12.488]  Calling South Africa.
[00:43:13.569 --> 00:43:14.450]  Calling South Africa.
[00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.131]  Did we lose that call from South Africa?
[00:43:18.303 --> 00:43:18.924]  Alex, are you there?
[00:43:19.064 --> 00:43:19.724]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[00:43:19.744 --> 00:43:23.587]  Yeah, Alex, I just wanted to thank you for taking my call.
[00:43:24.148 --> 00:43:25.028]  Well, thank you for calling.
[00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:37.818]  Yeah, I watched your first documentary of yours about three years ago, and it's really been since then, trying to speak to friends, and everyone thinks you're crazy and you're weird.
[00:43:38.418 --> 00:43:40.240]  I just have a few questions, if that's okay?
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.140]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:43:44.123 --> 00:43:47.045]  Did you ever give your thumbprint for your driver's license?
[00:43:47.657 --> 00:43:48.237]  Yes, I did.
[00:43:48.257 --> 00:44:02.246]  Okay, so you're eventually forced into it because they, they, um, we only have one telecoms company here and, uh, I've been reading up, they've set aside the frequency for RFID tags in South Africa now.
[00:44:02.966 --> 00:44:14.453]  They've got the frequency set up, the towers are going up, blah, blah, blah, and in the government documents, an RFID chip is defined as a chip to track goods, animals, or people.
[00:44:15.474 --> 00:44:17.295]  And then you tell this to people and they think you're crazy.
[00:44:18.044 --> 00:44:26.792]  Well, see, they've been psychologically preconditioned, and there's also the rationale there, there's also the cognitive dissonance, and people want to be lazy.
[00:44:27.252 --> 00:44:28.213]  They want to procrastinate.
[00:44:28.253 --> 00:44:29.454]  Oh, everything's fine.
[00:44:29.754 --> 00:44:31.335]  Well, they're going to find out how fine it is.
[00:44:32.256 --> 00:44:34.979]  And the New World Order took over your country a long time ago.
[00:44:35.079 --> 00:44:36.200]  It's not changed hands.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.060]  The same people run it.
[00:44:37.481 --> 00:44:40.984]  All that stuff, of course, was staged in the 90s, and that's now all come out.
[00:44:41.024 --> 00:44:42.945]  Very same people own it before.
[00:44:44.287 --> 00:44:45.708]  And the same thing is happening here.
[00:44:45.868 --> 00:44:55.133]  RFID in real time is going to track and tax our cars, our persons, what we buy is going to be scanned, and it all goes into this total Pentagon surveillance system.
[00:44:55.494 --> 00:45:02.478]  They announced this global world map they just created with every person and all of our data in it, tracking us in real time last week.
[00:45:02.778 --> 00:45:04.019]  Well, we talked about that years ago.
[00:45:04.039 --> 00:45:06.200]  The Pentagon announced they're already tracking everybody in real time.
[00:45:07.225 --> 00:45:09.828]  The Pentagon designed the world grid.
[00:45:09.848 --> 00:45:11.950]  They call it a world control grid.
[00:45:12.451 --> 00:45:14.153]  And they say they're going to enslave us.
[00:45:14.193 --> 00:45:15.434]  That's the incredible part.
[00:45:15.575 --> 00:45:16.295]  They don't even hide it.
[00:45:18.938 --> 00:45:26.227]  I was on a plane trip recently and in the plane magazine they were talking about a robot in South Korea
[00:45:26.949 --> 00:45:35.436]  That distinguishes between animals and humans, and it would shoot any human it considers an enemy, and in brackets I say it all without an RFID tag.
[00:45:35.877 --> 00:45:53.972]  Yes, and also, the airlines are about to put cameras in the backs of the seats that watch your face, surveil you the entire time, with AI computers that decide if your eye movement is regressive, like VoidComp out of Blade Runner, and they've announced in New York, LA, major cities, all over England,
[00:45:54.312 --> 00:45:55.092]  One last question.
[00:45:55.112 --> 00:45:55.972]  When is Endgame coming out?
[00:46:21.659 --> 00:46:25.603]  Endgame is going to be done in about two weeks, but then it has to go to the distributor.
[00:46:25.963 --> 00:46:30.367]  It has to be mass-produced, and it'll roll out in late October.
[00:46:30.747 --> 00:46:32.589]  You'll be able to start pre-orders October 1st.
[00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:35.712]  Alex, thank you very much for your time.
[00:46:35.872 --> 00:46:36.512]  Thank you, sir.
[00:46:36.532 --> 00:46:41.276]  I appreciate your call there from South Africa.
[00:46:41.657 --> 00:46:43.919]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:46:43.959 --> 00:46:46.161]  Let's talk to Greg in New Jersey.
[00:46:46.621 --> 00:46:47.582]  Greg, you're on the air.
[00:46:47.642 --> 00:46:47.962]  Welcome.
[00:46:48.002 --> 00:46:48.603]  Thanks for holding.
[00:46:52.347 --> 00:46:53.108]  I hear you breathing there.
[00:46:53.128 --> 00:46:53.768]  I'm going to let you go.
[00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.789]  Thank you for the call.
[00:46:54.809 --> 00:46:57.071]  Let's talk to Michael in Pennsylvania.
[00:46:57.672 --> 00:46:58.533]  You're on the air, Michael.
[00:46:58.553 --> 00:46:58.933]  Go ahead.
[00:46:59.634 --> 00:47:00.074]  Hey, Alex.
[00:47:00.094 --> 00:47:00.435]  How you doing?
[00:47:00.455 --> 00:47:01.355]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:47:01.816 --> 00:47:02.096]  You bet.
[00:47:02.116 --> 00:47:02.436]  Go ahead.
[00:47:03.317 --> 00:47:03.638]  Question.
[00:47:03.658 --> 00:47:05.299]  What do you think of Dr. Bill Deagle?
[00:47:05.519 --> 00:47:12.646]  I saw something online on him at the Grenada Forum, and he was talking about aliens and sort of stuff like that, and I saw his name on your website.
[00:47:12.666 --> 00:47:16.950]  What do you personally think of him, and what do you think of this alien conspiracy and that sort of thing?
[00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:23.350]  Well, look, number one, my show is not about other people in the truth movement or the patriot movement.
[00:47:23.871 --> 00:47:30.412]  And there are genres that flow, I wouldn't say left or right, but the political spectrum is more like a circle.
[00:47:31.252 --> 00:47:35.153]  And you've got people saying interesting things all over it.
[00:47:35.953 --> 00:47:38.154]  I mainly interview people about government documents.
[00:47:38.474 --> 00:47:40.214]  I've never really done shows on aliens.
[00:47:40.654 --> 00:47:43.295]  I've never heard Dr. Deagle talk about aliens.
[00:47:43.755 --> 00:47:46.876]  I mean, he's a medical doctor and he talks about
[00:47:47.532 --> 00:47:49.733]  Different issues of bioweapons and things I've interviewed him.
[00:47:50.653 --> 00:47:54.574]  But, I mean, I've been on coast-to-coast AM before and had George Norris say, what do you think of aliens?
[00:47:54.634 --> 00:48:06.677]  And I've said, well, there's, you know, Hubble's telescopes photographed hundreds of billions of galaxies, with billions of stars, in some cases trillions of stars apiece, with tens of trillions of planetoids orbiting each star, solar systems.
[00:48:07.377 --> 00:48:10.298]  And I don't think we're the only thing in the universe, but I've never seen little green men.
[00:48:11.118 --> 00:48:13.299]  But certainly, I mean, we tend to be...
[00:48:14.935 --> 00:48:41.677]  kind of idiosyncratic and only think about what's happening here on the planet, kind of planetary introspective, instead of thinking about the fact that we are literally a spaceship, a rock, with a thin layer of life, a few miles of breathable gas, not even a mile of breathable gas, with a few miles of atmosphere, trees, a few feet of life on the surface of the ground,
[00:48:42.324 --> 00:48:44.005]  And we're literally orbiting a sun.
[00:48:44.045 --> 00:48:45.426]  I mean, that's wonderful.
[00:48:45.446 --> 00:48:46.067]  That's incredible.
[00:48:46.427 --> 00:48:49.069]  I mean, look at the majestic majesty of life.
[00:48:49.469 --> 00:48:50.510]  The wonder of it all.
[00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:51.931]  That's what I'd love to talk about on this show.
[00:48:53.092 --> 00:48:57.395]  And it'd be fun to talk about who really built the pyramids and things like that, but I'll leave that to others, okay?
[00:48:57.435 --> 00:49:02.659]  I mean, I can't get people to admit that the government says they've been spying on everyone for decades.
[00:49:03.299 --> 00:49:04.440]  And that the government's illegitimate.
[00:49:05.126 --> 00:49:09.829]  Or they can type into Google, trillions missing, and they'll get Associated Press that the government's completely criminal.
[00:49:10.229 --> 00:49:12.911]  And that corporations are basically moving in mass offshore.
[00:49:13.231 --> 00:49:14.712]  And that the country's basically sinking.
[00:49:15.533 --> 00:49:19.295]  And they're trying to cut the country's head off with this amnesty plan they're still pushing.
[00:49:20.295 --> 00:49:26.719]  I mean, it took us years to convince people that the amnesty plan was an amnesty plan, because people finally read the bills.
[00:49:28.801 --> 00:49:32.063]  I mean, it's frustrating for me
[00:49:32.927 --> 00:49:37.169]  Because all I've ever tried to do is cover what's going on.
[00:49:37.769 --> 00:49:39.269]  So that's basically what it comes down to.
[00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:42.751]  Anything I talk about, you can go confirm for yourself.
[00:49:42.891 --> 00:49:44.091]  I'd say about 95% of it.
[00:49:44.211 --> 00:49:47.693]  I mean, sometimes I speculate or comment on things I've personally seen.
[00:49:48.933 --> 00:49:57.656]  Let's go ahead and take a call from John in Georgia.
[00:49:57.756 --> 00:49:58.677]  You're on the air.
[00:49:58.717 --> 00:49:59.217]  Welcome, John.
[00:49:59.935 --> 00:50:07.259]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to let you know that a little while ago Fox News was talking to Ron Paul live and your name came up several times in that conversation.
[00:50:07.279 --> 00:50:08.840]  What were they saying?
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.182]  How dare you talk to Alex Jones?
[00:50:11.402 --> 00:50:20.467]  Basically and they tried to bait him and ask him if he thought 9-11 was an inside job and he said no but it was definitely used to go to war.
[00:50:21.268 --> 00:50:25.150]  But they came out right and asked why do you associate yourself with Alex Jones?
[00:50:26.141 --> 00:50:31.729]  And he just said that you both support some of each other's ideas, but nobody really agrees 100% with anyone else.
[00:50:31.769 --> 00:50:32.349]  Exactly!
[00:50:32.369 --> 00:50:33.831]  Look, look, look, here's the deal.
[00:50:34.572 --> 00:50:40.360]  Okay, Ron Paul has said on my show, without me prompting, out of the blue, he just says, your show has given me the most support.
[00:50:40.988 --> 00:50:44.751]  And by the way, I'm not talking about 5% and that's the most support.
[00:50:44.851 --> 00:50:49.595]  I mean more than half the support he got in the first half of his campaign.
[00:50:49.616 --> 00:50:52.318]  Now he's exponentially risen, but still we're about 20%.
[00:50:52.778 --> 00:50:56.682]  I don't want to get into any behind-the-scenes stuff.
[00:50:57.262 --> 00:50:59.564]  It may just be best if I don't interview Ron Paul anymore.
[00:50:59.844 --> 00:51:00.565]  Let's just say that.
[00:51:01.764 --> 00:51:03.925]  I mean, I have been asked... I don't even want to get into it.
[00:51:04.285 --> 00:51:06.946]  I mean, look, people who are smart ask me political advice.
[00:51:07.226 --> 00:51:09.507]  People who are smart ask me about political strategy.
[00:51:09.947 --> 00:51:10.267]  Okay?
[00:51:10.507 --> 00:51:12.048]  And I've never tried to be a political strategist.
[00:51:12.428 --> 00:51:12.668]  Okay?
[00:51:12.688 --> 00:51:14.269]  But I have... I'm not even going to get into it.
[00:51:14.569 --> 00:51:16.089]  The point is, is that I know Ron Paul.
[00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:17.810]  I've known Ron Paul for 13 years.
[00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:20.691]  I've been interviewing Ron Paul for coming up on 13 years.
[00:51:21.331 --> 00:51:23.832]  And they keep attacking him for coming on my radio show.
[00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:30.263]  And I may just call up his campaign and tell Ron Paul to renounce me and call me Satan, and then he can just go on.
[00:51:30.503 --> 00:51:30.763]  Alright?
[00:51:31.423 --> 00:51:32.484]  So, uh, stay there.
[00:51:32.524 --> 00:51:35.205]  I want to hear more about... Well, I got a guest coming up.
[00:51:35.705 --> 00:51:38.567]  But, uh, do you mind holding to tell me more about it after the guest is gone in 15 minutes?
[00:51:38.587 --> 00:51:39.187]  Sure, I'll hold.
[00:51:39.467 --> 00:51:40.088]  Okay, I'll put you on hold.
[00:51:40.108 --> 00:51:41.408]  We got a special guest as they show up.
[00:51:41.768 --> 00:51:42.709]  Coming up after this break.
[00:51:43.509 --> 00:51:48.652]  And, uh, yeah, you can learn about the evil one that they're attacking Ron Paul about at PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com.
[00:51:48.672 --> 00:51:49.132]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:51.641]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.

[00:52:27.485 --> 00:52:30.646]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:52:31.307 --> 00:52:37.769]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:53:35.945 --> 00:53:38.468]  Welcome back to this live Sunday edition.
[00:53:38.508 --> 00:53:40.509]  We're here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:46.715]  Syndicated via EMS and the GCN Radio Network out of the studios of this Radio 590K LBJ.
[00:53:47.155 --> 00:53:51.259]  Coming to your living room, your car, your boats out there, your ships at sea.
[00:53:52.077 --> 00:53:54.218]  Alright, coming up, I'm going to get into this headline.
[00:53:54.279 --> 00:53:57.781]  Foot-and-mouth virus has been released in England again from Government Lab.
[00:53:57.841 --> 00:53:59.382]  It threatens the United States.
[00:53:59.482 --> 00:54:00.863]  We'll be going over that.
[00:54:00.903 --> 00:54:03.565]  Also, American Al-Qaeda says they're going to go after U.S.
[00:54:04.185 --> 00:54:04.705]  embassies.
[00:54:06.066 --> 00:54:08.408]  More on the House passing the eavesdropping bill.
[00:54:08.468 --> 00:54:10.049]  Congressman Ron Paul censored today.
[00:54:10.489 --> 00:54:12.971]  Fox News attacking him in my name.
[00:54:14.011 --> 00:54:18.454]  So, we'll be going, according to a caller, and they've done that before, so we'll track that down.
[00:54:18.474 --> 00:54:20.756]  I'm sure somebody will put the video up on YouTube.
[00:54:21.756 --> 00:54:29.219]  But right now we're joined by Dr. Dave Hart, National Spokesperson for the Comprehensive Masonic CHIP Program.
[00:54:29.999 --> 00:54:36.742]  And he's based with the Massachusetts Freemasons Masonic Youth Child ID Program.
[00:54:37.422 --> 00:54:43.145]  But this isn't just for the Eastern Star or the other boys and girls that I guess are getting involved.
[00:54:43.245 --> 00:54:48.207]  They go into the public schools, private schools, and they basically bankroll it here.
[00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:50.591]  And that's extremely interesting.
[00:54:50.611 --> 00:54:53.052]  I've heard about this program for 2 or 3 or 4 years.
[00:54:53.072 --> 00:54:54.293]  I don't know how long it's been going on.
[00:54:55.093 --> 00:54:58.255]  And so joining us to speak about it is Dr. Hart.
[00:54:58.275 --> 00:54:59.135]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[00:54:59.535 --> 00:54:59.956]  Thank you.
[00:55:00.936 --> 00:55:06.139]  Just tell me how old this program is and how many states it's in and how many children have been enrolled.
[00:55:06.619 --> 00:55:09.080]  This program is now 9 years old.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.822]  It started in Massachusetts and it's now in 22 states.
[00:55:13.286 --> 00:55:15.908]  And the province of Ontario is getting on board.
[00:55:16.748 --> 00:55:24.293]  We have comprehensively ID'd over 1 million children across America with this program and it's continuing to grow.
[00:55:25.695 --> 00:55:29.556]  Now, I saw a report in England where they're also doing some similar things.
[00:55:29.996 --> 00:55:33.717]  Yes, we've got a lot of interest in England and the Far East.
[00:55:34.178 --> 00:55:52.123]  The program, just for your listeners, it basically is a comprehensive program where we webcam the children and it goes on a computer disc that moms can bring with them anywhere in the world and it's computer compatible with National Amber Alerts so if their child ever went missing,
[00:55:53.163 --> 00:56:00.406]  They could instantly put it on any law enforcement National Amber Alert to get a signal out.
[00:56:00.426 --> 00:56:09.069]  It also entails their fingerprints and that's computer compatible with all the programs that the FBI and the FBI uses.
[00:56:10.489 --> 00:56:11.370]  And that's biometric?
[00:56:11.731 --> 00:56:12.872]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:56:13.312 --> 00:56:18.917]  And the third part of the program is a tooth print, which is a thermoplastic wafer that kids bite into.
[00:56:19.498 --> 00:56:22.761]  And that gives an absolute positive identification of the children.
[00:56:23.141 --> 00:56:28.386]  And on that tooth print is also a DNA sample and a scent sample for scent discriminating dogs.
[00:56:29.026 --> 00:56:31.969]  Even four years later, a dog could smell that toothprint.
[00:56:32.029 --> 00:56:41.397]  Now, depending on which version of this in the States I've seen, because I've seen different reports, usually the family keeps it, but sometimes some of the digital data is stored with the police.
[00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:42.799]  I mean, how does this work?
[00:56:42.859 --> 00:56:45.721]  With this program, only the family members keep it.
[00:56:45.781 --> 00:56:52.788]  That's very important to the Masonic fraternity, that families have this and not be a centralized big brother type of program.
[00:56:53.408 --> 00:56:55.270]  Sure, you're the national head of all this.
[00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:56.291]  Are you the founder?
[00:56:56.311 --> 00:56:57.012]  Did you think this up?
[00:57:10.004 --> 00:57:12.146]  98 in Massachusetts.
[00:57:12.226 --> 00:57:14.247]  And just like a light bulb being?
[00:57:15.287 --> 00:57:18.489]  It actually, that's one of the most asked questions I get.
[00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:21.992]  It was actually TWA flight 800 when the plane went into the ocean.
[00:57:22.412 --> 00:57:28.976]  There were 100 of the 300 victims were teenagers, all with perfect teeth, perfect dentitions.
[00:57:29.036 --> 00:57:31.157]  They all had blank dental records.
[00:57:31.758 --> 00:57:37.041]  And because of that, it took six to eight weeks for DNA testing to come back to identify some of those victims.
[00:57:37.481 --> 00:57:41.766]  So I felt a comprehensive identification system was really needed in America.
[00:57:41.786 --> 00:57:49.514]  Yeah, my dad helped identify, he's a dentist, some of his patients, I forget the name of the flight that flew into the water tower in Dallas.
[00:57:49.774 --> 00:57:51.576]  That was back in the 80s.
[00:57:52.598 --> 00:57:59.385]  Look, when they put in biometrics here in Texas to get a driver's license, they said, oh, it's to help with tornadoes.
[00:57:59.921 --> 00:58:13.546]  And then now they're using it to get into the gym, they're using it to get school lunches, and bottom line here, they said that the AMBER Alert system was going to be, back in 96, was going to be just for kidnapped children.
[00:58:13.786 --> 00:58:25.051]  Now they've got the big billboards up flashing, you know, don't use drugs, report terrorism, they're bussing it on radio with their EAS system taking over, and so the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:58:25.071 --> 00:58:26.051]  I mean, I'm not saying that
[00:58:27.552 --> 00:58:31.175]  With the parents saving all this, you guys put it on the computer and give them a disc.
[00:58:31.875 --> 00:58:34.857]  I'm not saying that overall there couldn't be some good uses here.
[00:58:35.438 --> 00:58:38.380]  I just frankly, you know, the whole thing is just spooky.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:42.303]  And then you've got a secret brotherhood that's out here pushing it.
[00:58:42.603 --> 00:58:49.308]  And I guess we've tracked it directly back to the fount, the great architect we have here on the air with us right now.
[00:58:50.703 --> 00:58:54.447]  Well, we don't keep any records on file and everything is wiped off the computer.
[00:58:54.507 --> 00:58:59.672]  There's no data kept whatsoever by the fraternity for any of this.
[00:59:00.012 --> 00:59:00.793]  It's all given to them.
[00:59:00.813 --> 00:59:08.821]  But it does go on to a computer and then go on... Is it like these electronic voting machines though where it's just a black box and just trusts us?
[00:59:10.596 --> 00:59:13.798]  People can actually watch it being wiped off at the end of the program.
[00:59:13.858 --> 00:59:18.642]  I mean, they keep it on the data for that day, just in case anybody needs a change.
[00:59:18.662 --> 00:59:20.284]  Well, look, here's my problem with it, okay?
[00:59:20.304 --> 00:59:21.225]  Take England right now.
[00:59:21.285 --> 00:59:24.207]  You can type this into Google and find Times of London on this if you want.
[00:59:24.247 --> 00:59:28.030]  Last year they announced, oh, to these third graders, you're James Bond.
[00:59:28.291 --> 00:59:29.271]  Don't tell your parents.
[00:59:29.291 --> 00:59:33.115]  We're going to retina scan and thumbprint and index finger you and take your DNA.
[00:59:33.835 --> 00:59:41.227]  And it became a big row over there in England, a big fight, and then the government just said, okay, now it's a policy, we're making you do it.
[00:59:41.528 --> 00:59:47.598]  So see, that's the problem here, is this could be seen as an acclimation for the children to be given their DNA.
[00:59:48.752 --> 00:59:51.634]  Well, the DNA, there's nothing kept on file there.
[00:59:51.674 --> 00:59:55.876]  I mean, the tooth print is done by American Dental Association dentists across the nation.
[00:59:56.277 --> 00:59:59.118]  That is given directly back to the parents.
[00:59:59.159 --> 01:00:02.401]  There's nothing kept on file there at all, or the DNA cheek swabs.
[01:00:02.581 --> 01:00:04.122]  Listen, you sound like a nice person, sir.
[01:00:04.162 --> 01:00:06.443]  Why don't you tell... I mean, there's so many websites.
[01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:08.104]  There's all these chapters.
[01:00:08.144 --> 01:00:12.127]  Should we give out the MassFreeMasonry.org website to go find out about this?
[01:00:12.427 --> 01:00:13.407]  Well, we have the...
[01:00:15.089 --> 01:00:23.297]  Child ID, they just have to do comprehensivechildid.org, masonicchildid.org, and they'll bump right into it.
[01:00:23.557 --> 01:00:28.382]  Well look, my problem with all of this is, is that there's people like you who mean well doing all this.
[01:00:28.402 --> 01:00:30.745]  I know the Masons and people do the burn victims and the rest of it.
[01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:35.944]  And I understand most people that go to it just to play poker and eat pizza and then, you know, go collect money for kids.
[01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:37.546]  I mean, I understand that, okay?
[01:00:38.486 --> 01:00:43.630]  But I'm just wondering, you know, how this could be misused or how people could be conditioned.
[01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:45.971]  Because over in England now, they stop you for speeding.
[01:00:46.232 --> 01:00:48.433]  They're forcing you to take DNA, to give DNA.
[01:00:48.473 --> 01:00:49.914]  Now in the U.S., they're starting this.
[01:00:50.495 --> 01:00:55.898]  And in the schools, they're trying to make children thumb scan to get, you know, school lunches or to check out books.
[01:00:56.199 --> 01:00:57.159]  Do you think that's a good idea?
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:57.980]  No, I don't.
[01:00:58.635 --> 01:00:59.896]  Well, that's a positive.
[01:00:59.916 --> 01:01:00.176]  I don't.
[01:01:00.817 --> 01:01:05.941]  The only reason I got involved with this is strictly for identification of kids or missing kids.
[01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:13.888]  Right now, across America, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reports as 99,000 missing kids as I speak right now across America.
[01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:16.591]  How many is that number right now?
[01:01:16.611 --> 01:01:19.173]  99,000 missing children in the United States of America.
[01:01:19.213 --> 01:01:19.433]  No, no.
[01:01:19.453 --> 01:01:24.318]  I mean, the UN says 1.2 million women and children are kidnapped out of Central Europe alone each year.
[01:01:25.459 --> 01:01:26.480]  But again, here's the problem.
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:37.731]  Did you ever see that Time Magazine 2000 cover, The Shame of Foster Care, where government statistically is five times more likely to abuse or hurt or even kill children while they're in the custody?
[01:01:37.972 --> 01:01:42.516]  I mean, they warehouse children right here in Austin for months on end just in
[01:01:44.237 --> 01:01:50.699]  Government office buildings, and then the child abuse by the foster parents, and again, I'm saying statistically.
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.760]  I'm not saying they're all bad, but statistically, is just much higher than parents.
[01:01:54.021 --> 01:02:02.863]  My whole point is that that's my point, is the government, just statistically, doesn't have the statistical track record to clean toilets, much less be over our children.
[01:02:02.923 --> 01:02:05.564]  I know you're saying, this is private, you're coming in and doing this.
[01:02:05.804 --> 01:02:10.466]  Why aren't parents just doing this themselves, going out and buying the kits or getting this themselves?
[01:02:10.766 --> 01:02:18.894]  Well, as I always say, the first child born gets five baby photo albums, second child born gets one baby photo album, third child asks whether the camera broke.
[01:02:19.175 --> 01:02:28.364]  So when kids actually go missing in America, most family members don't have any, even a photograph to work with trying to return their child, which is the most important thing.
[01:02:28.724 --> 01:02:29.444]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:02:29.464 --> 01:02:32.445]  Here is all the materials that law enforcement needs.
[01:02:32.485 --> 01:02:33.026]  We've got a break.
[01:02:33.066 --> 01:02:33.546]  We've got a break.
[01:02:33.586 --> 01:02:33.966]  Stay there.
[01:02:34.026 --> 01:02:35.066]  Just a three minute break.
[01:02:35.086 --> 01:02:36.787]  I'm going to come right back to you for just a second.
[01:02:36.827 --> 01:02:41.968]  We'll just spend five more minutes with you and let you have your say about your new national CHIP program.
[01:02:42.389 --> 01:02:43.009]  Well, it's not new.
[01:02:43.049 --> 01:02:43.709]  It's nine years old.
[01:02:43.769 --> 01:02:44.229]  It's growing.
[01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:45.030]  It's growing.
[01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:46.330]  We'll be right back.
[01:02:52.136 --> 01:03:00.609]  Did you know that we ingest toxins and harsh chemicals every day from the foods and alcohol we consume, the water we drink, and the OTCs and prescription medications we take?
[01:03:00.889 --> 01:03:07.079]  Thankfully, our liver neutralizes the effects of these toxins and eliminates them from our bodies before they can do too much damage.
[01:03:07.359 --> 01:03:15.062]  The fact is the liver performs over 500 vital functions in the body, from aiding digestion to removing toxins and maintaining good health.
[01:03:15.302 --> 01:03:25.567]  So why not give your liver the help it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula prescribed by more than 200,000 doctors in over 76 countries.
[01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:28.748]  It's backed by more than 300 clinical trials and studies.
[01:03:28.968 --> 01:03:31.709]  LIV52 is the most researched herbal formula for the liver.
[01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:35.131]  So if you want to detoxify and protect the liver, LIV52 is for you.
[01:03:35.851 --> 01:03:36.351]  Thank you.
[01:03:52.225 --> 01:03:55.888]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:03:56.289 --> 01:04:01.714]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:04:02.174 --> 01:04:03.235]  It makes me wonder if a U.S.
[01:04:03.275 --> 01:04:07.279]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:04:07.979 --> 01:04:21.343]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:04:21.803 --> 01:04:27.124]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:04:27.384 --> 01:04:33.286]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[01:04:41.117 --> 01:04:43.300]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:43.381]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:04:55.328 --> 01:04:58.490]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:00.792]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:01.152 --> 01:05:08.777]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:09.494 --> 01:05:16.535]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:16.935 --> 01:05:28.317]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:28.657 --> 01:05:32.198]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:32.638 --> 01:05:34.578]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:34.898 --> 01:05:38.719]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:52.242 --> 01:05:54.003]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:05:54.103 --> 01:05:55.364]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:05:55.604 --> 01:05:58.425]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:05:58.806 --> 01:06:01.567]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:06:02.087 --> 01:06:08.831]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:44.961]  You're listening to GCN.
[01:06:44.981 --> 01:06:47.703]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:06:47.723 --> 01:06:49.284]  Raging for the truth.
[01:06:49.465 --> 01:06:53.127]  Exposing corruption.
[01:06:53.187 --> 01:06:54.669]  Dismantling the false left-right paradigm.
[01:06:54.709 --> 01:06:55.249]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.725 --> 01:07:19.029]  I wonder why we have, statistically, one of the highest levels of missing children.
[01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:29.419]  Now, that huge number you heard, they're counting a lot of 14, 15, 16, 17-year-olds that ran away because daddy drinks a half gallon of whiskey every night and beats the hell out of them with a tire iron.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.142]  But there are tens of thousands of missing children.
[01:07:32.162 --> 01:07:38.068]  I remember CNN reported 3,000 missing in Florida a couple years ago that the CPS had taken.
[01:07:38.951 --> 01:07:41.772]  They found them overseas, heads cut off in shallow graves.
[01:07:42.833 --> 01:07:43.693]  Some of them.
[01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:44.533]  One little black girl.
[01:07:44.953 --> 01:07:48.815]  You know, that's why I get to the point where I just think government doing this really scares me.
[01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:53.557]  And of course, I had a congressman a few years ago from South Carolina discover what we'd already reported.
[01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:59.319]  Australia, the U.S., Canada, New Zealand, I call it the echelon group of countries.
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:04.061]  At birth, they tell you, oh, we want to blood test your baby for blood diseases.
[01:08:04.594 --> 01:08:04.854]  I think so.
[01:08:24.583 --> 01:08:30.745]  And, uh, or it is sent to Michigan to a federal, uh, depository, uh, where they, uh, put all that stuff.
[01:08:31.165 --> 01:08:32.805]  So that's why we get a little concerned.
[01:08:33.145 --> 01:08:39.087]  And the program here, oh, you didn't know if you're 34 or younger, you're in a federal database and you're born in a hospital.
[01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:46.129]  Yeah, they could do the blood test there at the hospital, boys and girls, being sent to the federally funded city health department.
[01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:48.891]  But going back to Dr. Dave Hart.
[01:08:49.311 --> 01:08:50.451]  Hey, Doc, are you an MD?
[01:08:50.471 --> 01:08:52.072]  Were you aware of that federal database?
[01:08:52.112 --> 01:08:52.892]  No, I'm a DMD.
[01:08:53.132 --> 01:08:53.633]  Oh, DMD.
[01:08:53.653 --> 01:08:56.934]  Yeah, I'm a forensic dentist and that's what got me interested in this whole thing.
[01:08:57.094 --> 01:08:57.934]  Oh, okay, interesting, yeah.
[01:08:58.094 --> 01:09:00.795]  And the tooth print, there's no way to duplicate that.
[01:09:00.835 --> 01:09:06.297]  So that's actually done right in public, given right to the parents, so there's no way to duplicate any of this data.
[01:09:06.477 --> 01:09:08.498]  No, no, I'm not saying you're doing that.
[01:09:08.838 --> 01:09:10.319]  This is a way to get people to think.
[01:09:10.799 --> 01:09:12.720]  And I was asking, are you an MD or what are you?
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.880]  Yeah, I'm a DMD.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.821]  Yeah, since you're a doctor of medical,
[01:09:16.521 --> 01:09:20.404]  I think it's terrible that we have so many missing and we have 40,000 unidentified.
[01:09:20.584 --> 01:09:26.528]  And for instance, on 9-1-1 we had 2,749 victims and only 54% were positively identified.
[01:09:26.548 --> 01:09:28.730]  Well, I don't mean to sound sarcastic, I'm serious.
[01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:32.132]  If they were made out of the same stuff that those passports were made out of,
[01:09:45.061 --> 01:09:46.482]  We would have been able to identify their whole bodies.
[01:09:46.502 --> 01:09:48.842]  Because those two passports didn't even get burned, remember?
[01:09:49.682 --> 01:09:50.323]  They were magic.
[01:09:50.703 --> 01:09:53.324]  No, there were 18,000 body parts recovered.
[01:09:53.404 --> 01:09:58.785]  And had they had tooth prints done, hundreds and hundreds more people would have been identified at the 9-1-1.
[01:09:58.825 --> 01:10:04.607]  But did you know that pieces of bone were blasted across the street, even onto 50-story bank buildings?
[01:10:06.267 --> 01:10:08.108]  It was unbelievable what happened.
[01:10:08.168 --> 01:10:14.490]  And I know people that perished there, so I just... No, what I'm saying is, how did... I mean, nothing was bigger than about an inch.
[01:10:15.009 --> 01:10:16.469]  I mean, bone was blown into little bitty pieces.
[01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:17.350]  I have firemen on tape.
[01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:20.971]  Everything was, you know, just aerosolized, but then those passports survived.
[01:10:22.831 --> 01:10:23.552]  It was random.
[01:10:23.952 --> 01:10:24.552]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:24.832 --> 01:10:27.873]  Well, listen, uh... Whole dollars were recovered.
[01:10:27.893 --> 01:10:37.096]  Well, that's right, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but
[01:10:37.751 --> 01:10:38.491]  Pancake Theory!
[01:10:38.872 --> 01:10:43.734]  But Doctor, the point here is that those passports were supposedly inside the plane.
[01:10:44.155 --> 01:10:45.415]  Nothing from inside the plane.
[01:10:45.535 --> 01:10:48.277]  Engines were turned into tiny little molten pieces.
[01:10:48.637 --> 01:10:50.018]  Everything was shattered in the plane.
[01:10:50.198 --> 01:10:53.600]  The passports weren't file cabinets and papers coming out the windows.
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.901]  Those were passports inside the planes.
[01:10:56.142 --> 01:11:08.030]  Listen, the website is Jobulon.org, I mean Mass Freemasonry.org, and just say hi to all the angels for me, and we appreciate you coming on with us.
[01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:09.030]  Well, thank you kindly.
[01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:09.691]  You take care.
[01:11:09.751 --> 01:11:10.431]  Say hi to Lucifer.
[01:11:10.511 --> 01:11:11.752]  I feel him seething in my hands.
[01:11:12.553 --> 01:11:14.014]  Ah, there he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:15.595 --> 01:11:17.596]  I bet that guy has a 33rd degree, man.
[01:11:17.997 --> 01:11:19.818]  He's got all the baloney going.
[01:11:20.218 --> 01:11:22.920]  And please, if you're Masons, don't call up hating on me, okay?
[01:11:24.418 --> 01:11:28.141]  I don't sit here and say all the Masons are blood-drinking Satanists, okay?
[01:11:28.882 --> 01:11:31.564]  I know that there's 33 degrees that most of you are told about.
[01:11:31.624 --> 01:11:34.306]  You don't know that there are 360 main degrees.
[01:11:34.967 --> 01:11:36.488]  You don't know all of this, okay?
[01:11:37.449 --> 01:11:43.133]  And because you're porch Masons, you're kept on the outside and controlled, and your dues are used for all sorts of things.
[01:11:43.914 --> 01:11:47.417]  And I know that a lot of the Founding Fathers were Masons, and I know the founders of Texas were.
[01:11:48.217 --> 01:11:50.199]  And I had great-grandpas that were in the whole nine yards.
[01:11:50.999 --> 01:11:51.860]  They weren't bad people.
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:12:02.806]  The point is, is that at the top, this is a very shadowy group, and I'm sure the good doctor is a good guy, but his idea has been jumped on wholeheartedly.
[01:12:02.826 --> 01:12:04.307]  He did not like me talking about Javilon.
[01:12:04.347 --> 01:12:06.528]  Did you hear how upsetting that was to him?
[01:12:07.989 --> 01:12:08.949]  What's the name of their god?
[01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:14.233]  And they worship Elojah and Diana and just all the rest of it, man.
[01:12:14.313 --> 01:12:15.193]  It is something else.
[01:12:16.214 --> 01:12:17.675]  Have no more gods before me.
[01:12:18.275 --> 01:12:19.996]  They tell the first.
[01:12:21.255 --> 01:12:23.677]  First group of degrees that it's a Christian religion.
[01:12:23.757 --> 01:12:25.399]  I mean, it's hilarious, folks.
[01:12:25.479 --> 01:12:27.000]  It's absolutely hilarious.
[01:12:28.281 --> 01:12:33.505]  And so there's your little Masonic discussion for everybody.
[01:12:33.885 --> 01:12:35.787]  Okay, let me get into this now in some detail.
[01:12:35.807 --> 01:12:36.948]  We're going to come back and take calls.
[01:12:36.968 --> 01:12:37.769]  Give me the Ron Paul.
[01:12:38.209 --> 01:12:38.810]  Oh, you know what?
[01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:39.290]  He's been holding.
[01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.830]  He's been holding.
[01:12:40.631 --> 01:12:41.672]  John in Georgia.
[01:12:41.692 --> 01:12:46.156]  We'll just give him the Ron Paul right now and then in the foot and mouth, which is a very serious disease spreading in England.
[01:12:46.536 --> 01:12:48.918]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Georgia.
[01:12:49.913 --> 01:12:50.454]  You're on the air.
[01:12:50.494 --> 01:12:54.317]  So Fox News a couple hours ago was attacking Ron Paul again about me.
[01:12:54.337 --> 01:12:55.599]  I've seen him a few times.
[01:12:55.659 --> 01:12:56.459]  What show was it?
[01:12:56.479 --> 01:12:58.661]  So we can hopefully tape it when it re-airs tonight.
[01:12:58.682 --> 01:12:59.823]  And what specifically were they saying?
[01:13:00.163 --> 01:13:01.704]  Well it was called Big Story.
[01:13:01.724 --> 01:13:04.267]  Oh with Demon and Demon Gibson, yeah.
[01:13:04.687 --> 01:13:04.927]  Yeah.
[01:13:05.108 --> 01:13:05.928]  Have you already seen it?
[01:13:06.429 --> 01:13:08.731]  No, I just know Demon is one of their worst operatives, yeah.
[01:13:09.211 --> 01:13:10.973]  And that aired about 5.15 Eastern Time.
[01:13:12.728 --> 01:13:16.889]  Now, did they have the blonde lady in, or was it, uh, was Demon working on Sunday?
[01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:18.550]  Uh, no, it was a brunette lady.
[01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:22.071]  Okay, so they had one of their, one of those models on, okay.
[01:13:22.491 --> 01:13:27.393]  But, uh, she, she started bringing you up after someone emailed, sent an email question.
[01:13:27.493 --> 01:13:28.553]  Was it Michelle Malkin?
[01:13:29.194 --> 01:13:29.954]  No, no, it wasn't her.
[01:13:29.974 --> 01:13:33.655]  Okay, it wasn't the lady that writes books about everybody should be put in camps?
[01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:33.815]  No.
[01:13:33.835 --> 01:13:34.676]  Okay, it wasn't her, alright.
[01:13:35.576 --> 01:13:38.657]  So, so what specifically did the CIA have to say about me today?
[01:13:39.252 --> 01:13:45.898]  Well, they just basically said that Ron Paul said, compared 9-11 to the Gulf of Tonkin, or something like that.
[01:13:45.938 --> 01:13:52.804]  Which our government declassified, as we always said, was staged, and the LBJ tape has been released, where they staged the thing to get us in the war.
[01:13:53.464 --> 01:14:00.550]  Declassified as the captains that came back in 64 told people, it was in a San Diego post-dispatch, and everybody ignored it.
[01:14:01.932 --> 01:14:02.332]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:14:02.972 --> 01:14:08.494]  But they just said that he said that on your show, which I don't know if he really said that or not.
[01:14:09.394 --> 01:14:16.337]  Yes, he did say that on the house floor in January of this year, and he did say that on my show repeatedly, and he hasn't dodged that.
[01:14:17.997 --> 01:14:19.198]  And that was basically it.
[01:14:19.218 --> 01:14:27.921]  I mean, they tried to be nice to him, and they asked him a lot of questions and gave him a lot of air time, but ultimately they tried to bait him with that question about 9-11.
[01:14:28.021 --> 01:14:29.982]  Yeah, they tried to suck him in by being nice.
[01:14:30.222 --> 01:14:30.582]  Exactly.
[01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:34.642]  I'm glad to hear he didn't deny me.
[01:14:34.682 --> 01:14:37.963]  He said he comes on the show and agrees with some things and disagrees with others.
[01:14:38.643 --> 01:14:39.403]  That's certainly true.
[01:14:41.464 --> 01:14:43.044]  Yeah, I just thought you might be interested in that.
[01:14:43.084 --> 01:14:48.666]  What specifically did Congressman Paul say whenever they said, do you deny Alex Jones or do you accept him?
[01:14:48.886 --> 01:14:49.847]  What did he say?
[01:14:50.187 --> 01:14:54.308]  Well, he said that he supports you and that you support him.
[01:14:55.134 --> 01:15:02.298]  And, uh, but nobody agrees 100% with anyone else completely, so... Yeah, I'm really proud of Ron Paul, because they have beat him up.
[01:15:02.878 --> 01:15:05.840]  I mean, in his last campaign, they used me against him.
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:06.460]  Stay there.
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:07.341]  Stay there.
[01:15:07.521 --> 01:15:09.782]  Well, I'm gonna let you go, but... Audience, stay there.
[01:15:10.522 --> 01:15:14.044]  And the rebellion against the New World Order will continue.
[01:15:14.084 --> 01:15:20.648]  The rebellion against Jabulon will continue here as desperate souls continue their fight.
[01:15:21.429 --> 01:15:27.012]  It's the Wicked New World Order running our society directly into Hades' Ninth Circle.
[01:15:27.452 --> 01:15:30.553]  Infowars.com and PrismPlanet.com are the websites.

[01:17:42.469 --> 01:17:56.554]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:17:56.874 --> 01:17:58.754]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[01:17:58.954 --> 01:18:01.995]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:18:02.175 --> 01:18:05.316]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:18:05.616 --> 01:18:07.457]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:18:07.737 --> 01:18:08.097]  We're good to go.
[01:18:28.812 --> 01:18:29.293]  We're good to go.
[01:18:52.052 --> 01:18:54.014]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach.
[01:18:54.435 --> 01:18:56.177]  Look, up there in the sky.
[01:18:56.617 --> 01:18:57.919]  It's Non-X-Man.
[01:18:58.319 --> 01:18:59.441]  He's in a dive.
[01:18:59.461 --> 01:19:01.763]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[01:19:02.064 --> 01:19:02.845]  Let's go look.
[01:19:05.067 --> 01:19:06.749]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails are ugly.
[01:19:08.729 --> 01:19:09.969]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[01:19:10.190 --> 01:19:10.650]  Take them out.
[01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:11.950]  Let's see.
[01:19:11.970 --> 01:19:16.532]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[01:19:16.892 --> 01:19:17.372]  Don't worry.
[01:19:17.812 --> 01:19:19.333]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:19.953 --> 01:19:24.375]  Use it on your toenails regularly and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[01:19:24.915 --> 01:19:26.976]  Oh, I will, Non-X Man.
[01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:29.797]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:34.576]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[01:19:35.056 --> 01:19:38.538]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.

[01:19:50.265 --> 01:19:55.228]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:19:57.148 --> 01:20:01.310]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:20:04.392 --> 01:20:07.473]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[01:20:08.214 --> 01:20:10.615]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:12.616 --> 01:20:22.261]  Look, Dr. Paul is a Vietnam-era vet, obstetrician, delivered over 4,000 babies, been in Congress off and on for 20 years.
[01:20:24.205 --> 01:20:26.827]  And he hadn't fallen off the apple cart.
[01:20:28.148 --> 01:20:29.529]  He didn't just fall off it last week.
[01:20:29.549 --> 01:20:31.391]  He didn't just fall off the turnip truck.
[01:20:32.392 --> 01:20:34.013]  I was born in the dark, but it wasn't last night.
[01:20:34.053 --> 01:20:35.594]  Well, it's the same thing with Ron Paul.
[01:20:37.056 --> 01:20:42.840]  And I've been interviewing him for more than 12 years when nobody knew who he was, basically.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:50.226]  When he got back in Congress, when he was running for Congress again, 12, 13 years ago, I had him on right when I got on air, and I had him on a bunch.
[01:20:51.047 --> 01:20:53.549]  And my listeners, you, you wonderful people out there,
[01:20:54.326 --> 01:21:02.531]  I'm always bashing the neocons or mindless liberals that are tuned in, but my listeners, who are a lot of you collectively, I know are a lot smarter than I am, but a lot of you individually are a lot smarter than I am.
[01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:07.774]  I'm just somebody who does my homework and studies, to the point of where I can't even really regurgitate all the info I've got.
[01:21:08.755 --> 01:21:11.497]  That's a horrible image, but the point is that's what I do, basically.
[01:21:12.097 --> 01:21:13.378]  All the baby birds out there.
[01:21:14.358 --> 01:21:16.400]  But... Alright, that tip's a humor.
[01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:18.921]  But yeah, Ron Paul comes on my show.
[01:21:18.961 --> 01:21:19.942]  He says what he believes.
[01:21:19.982 --> 01:21:20.722]  People try to spin it.
[01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:21.563]  He came on,
[01:21:22.851 --> 01:21:27.233]  Last year, running for Congress, and I said, you know, George Bush is for this war.
[01:21:27.333 --> 01:21:28.273]  The people are against it.
[01:21:28.313 --> 01:21:29.694]  Seventy percent of the troops are against it.
[01:21:29.714 --> 01:21:30.674]  Eighty-plus percent of the people.
[01:21:30.694 --> 01:21:32.795]  A lot of conservatives are.
[01:21:32.875 --> 01:21:33.895]  You were against it from the start.
[01:21:34.336 --> 01:21:38.557]  Should we impeach him and the Democratic folks in Congress who have gone along with it?
[01:21:39.178 --> 01:21:39.818]  And he said, yes.
[01:21:39.918 --> 01:21:43.719]  Everybody who's not following the Bill of Rights and Constitution needs to be impeached.
[01:21:43.799 --> 01:21:45.360]  And he said, the whole government's out of control.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:50.002]  Well, they took that clip of him and a clip of me asking the question, edited it wrong,
[01:21:51.351 --> 01:21:59.372]  That has cut out the middle discussion and played it on Houston Radio, Austin Radio, which I could have fought with them about it, but I don't get into all this copyright stuff.
[01:22:01.573 --> 01:22:08.314]  So I said, you know, I'm not a hypocrite, I said, say La Vie, you can do what you want, and they misprinted it out of context in newspapers.
[01:22:09.314 --> 01:22:18.216]  And even though they gerrymandered, by the way, Trent Lott and all these people, they didn't get their gerrymandered, because he's a good little neocon, but others
[01:22:18.869 --> 01:22:21.970]  Another Tom DeLay rewrote the Senate and the House areas.
[01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:35.255]  They rewrote Texas, where he was given a mainly black district in Galveston and surrounding areas, very Democratic, and he won by 60, what was it, 65% of the vote.
[01:22:35.615 --> 01:22:36.775]  His previous record was 67.
[01:22:37.855 --> 01:22:39.996]  I mean, nobody's getting those, okay?
[01:22:40.016 --> 01:22:45.318]  I mean, when Republicans are dirt, okay, in the people's minds, Democrats aren't much better.
[01:22:46.241 --> 01:22:49.743]  Congress overall, at the time last year, had a 15% approval rating.
[01:22:49.903 --> 01:22:50.303]  They now have a 12%.
[01:22:50.363 --> 01:22:51.504]  That's a gallop.
[01:22:51.724 --> 01:22:52.324]  Probably worse.
[01:22:53.105 --> 01:22:59.308]  Ron Paul is winning by 65% in a new gerrymandered district.
[01:23:00.228 --> 01:23:02.330]  And so it blew up in their face, folks.
[01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:09.573]  Those black folks down there, they love those black Democrats hearing about how he wanted to impeach Bush, even though he didn't really say that.
[01:23:12.262 --> 01:23:27.050]  I mean, these Republican strategists, these neocons, are too busy off with their hookers and off snorting drugs and getting paid off, most of them, at the Watergate Hotel, to actually engage in any real strategy.
[01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:31.392]  I mean, they've got their false paradigm strategy, but not real political strategy.
[01:23:32.413 --> 01:23:37.075]  We have an Angus and Reed poll, commissioned by the New York Times and ABC News.
[01:23:38.616 --> 01:23:38.736]  No.
[01:23:40.791 --> 01:23:41.171]  No, no, no.
[01:23:41.351 --> 01:23:43.113]  That was Wall Street Journal, ABC News.
[01:23:44.334 --> 01:23:56.663]  Late last year, in November of last year, almost coming up on a year ago, that showed 82% of Americans believe they've been lied to about 9-11 and who really perpetrated it.
[01:23:57.223 --> 01:24:08.051]  In that same poll, 68% believe it's an inside job, and we have a separate index, Zogby, one of the most respected, more respected than Gallup, showing 68% inside job.
[01:24:10.865 --> 01:24:16.308]  Now, so Ron Paul, they're going, oh, you think it's an inside job, and he's sitting there going, playing politics.
[01:24:16.508 --> 01:24:19.429]  Well, not exactly, but they certainly use it for a police state in the war.
[01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:20.970]  And you've got 82% thinking that.
[01:24:23.917 --> 01:24:25.138]  68% that will say it!
[01:24:25.499 --> 01:24:43.636]  And by the way, polling science has shown in the past, you call up, even with Nielsen boxes, or Arbitron ratings, or other things, people will tend to say they're watching one thing, versus, or they'll have one TV they put stuff on, and then they're watching Cinemax, you know, sex videos on the other, or HBO Reels, you know.
[01:24:43.916 --> 01:24:48.921]  In here on the Nielsen box, they're watching this, there's big studies on this, and in here they're watching porno!
[01:24:50.248 --> 01:24:51.469]  Okay, so it's the same thing with polling.
[01:24:51.489 --> 01:24:52.770]  I've actually read the polling science on this.
[01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:54.351]  I've read quite a few papers on it over the years.
[01:24:54.571 --> 01:24:56.833]  It's a very interesting area, and I do what focus groups do.
[01:24:57.133 --> 01:24:57.954]  I index polls.
[01:24:58.294 --> 01:25:03.498]  What they pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to do, I can just take 12, 15 polls, put them in a calculator, average it together.
[01:25:03.758 --> 01:25:07.060]  That's what these, quote, polling focus group geniuses are doing.
[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:09.642]  Okay, it's a complete... but anyways, I digress.
[01:25:11.243 --> 01:25:12.164]  That's why when I tell you 90%
[01:25:14.893 --> 01:25:17.134]  The American people believe the government killed Kennedy.
[01:25:17.174 --> 01:25:19.536]  That is an index of 12 polls averaged together.
[01:25:19.596 --> 01:25:23.758]  I just went and indexed what was like six of them were scientific, the other six weren't.
[01:25:24.058 --> 01:25:26.459]  That's what they do too, the Republican-Democratic parties.
[01:25:26.839 --> 01:25:31.942]  They take those pieces, that's how you get even more accurate data, is fleshing a bunch of that together like a deck of cards.
[01:25:32.262 --> 01:25:44.771]  But I'm getting off into political science here, and real political science, versus the false paradigm that they project out, literally like a movie screen, to distract you from what's really going on right below the screen.
[01:25:45.151 --> 01:25:47.753]  And I'm just saying, please stop looking up and look right here.
[01:25:48.073 --> 01:25:49.414]  Do you see what these snakes are doing?
[01:25:50.114 --> 01:25:53.297]  So, Ron Paul... Okay, it's not just me.
[01:25:54.037 --> 01:25:59.601]  I said, six months ago when he announced, I said, only Ron Paul can defeat Hillary Clinton.
[01:26:01.084 --> 01:26:04.365]  The Republicans are passing the baton, and top Republican strategists have now admitted this.
[01:26:04.625 --> 01:26:06.725]  They're not really running anyone real against Hillary.
[01:26:07.065 --> 01:26:09.145]  The Democrats have now raised $135 million.
[01:26:09.285 --> 01:26:13.406]  It was $135 million just a month ago.
[01:26:13.426 --> 01:26:15.186]  $135 million more than Republicans.
[01:26:15.987 --> 01:26:17.367]  Usually the spread is $20-30 million.
[01:26:17.767 --> 01:26:20.507]  I mean, folks, that means people think Republicans are dead meat.
[01:26:20.767 --> 01:26:25.408]  They're not running people who really could win, or have any chance of it.
[01:26:26.828 --> 01:26:30.489]  They're running people who, because it's pretty well understood, it's a losing battle.
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:37.304]  Unless Republicans said, we're going to shut down the border, we're going to reverse gun control laws, then they'd win by a landslide.
[01:26:37.504 --> 01:26:42.028]  Because truly conservative slash libertarian, paleo-conservative ideas are truly popular.
[01:26:42.288 --> 01:26:48.512]  But the Republicans can't give you what you want, and what's constitutional, and what would make them win, because they're bought and paid for by special interests.
[01:26:48.732 --> 01:26:50.674]  So they're always in that paradox, okay?
[01:26:52.035 --> 01:26:54.476]  So, this is real political science.
[01:26:54.496 --> 01:26:58.119]  Most of these little local politicos in your town right now, let's say in Maryland, or
[01:26:58.536 --> 01:27:15.481]  You know, listening in Baltimore, or listening in Austin, or listening in Niagara, or listening in San Diego, or Tennessee, wherever you're listening, you know, your local little hacks go and have dinners, and act like powerful politicos, and walk around, and they spout the fake political news that's in the newspaper, and they feel real smart.
[01:27:15.801 --> 01:27:15.981]  Okay?
[01:27:16.001 --> 01:27:19.842]  You get in a room with real political strategists, and they talk about what's really going on.
[01:27:20.303 --> 01:27:20.623]  Okay?
[01:27:21.203 --> 01:27:22.183]  But again, that's the real world.
[01:27:22.203 --> 01:27:23.083]  Who wants to actually live in it?
[01:27:24.484 --> 01:27:25.484]  But I'm digressing here.
[01:27:25.744 --> 01:27:27.905]  I got off into political numbers and things.
[01:27:29.419 --> 01:27:33.280]  Las Vegas is saying in the last two months exactly, word for word, what I've said.
[01:27:33.621 --> 01:27:38.642]  The biggest, the big NFL online books, and they're about 95% accurate.
[01:27:38.662 --> 01:27:40.423]  They have to be or people won't subscribe to them.
[01:27:41.283 --> 01:27:41.623]  Okay?
[01:27:42.563 --> 01:27:44.384]  You've got the big NFL book.
[01:27:44.504 --> 01:27:46.545]  You've got some of the other biggest books.
[01:27:46.585 --> 01:27:47.505]  And I don't gamble, folks.
[01:27:47.965 --> 01:27:49.786]  But they've always been right about presidential elections.
[01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:50.586]  They're generally right.
[01:27:50.626 --> 01:27:51.346]  People bet on these.
[01:27:51.626 --> 01:27:55.068]  Some of the biggest bets are placed on presidential runs every four years.
[01:27:55.108 --> 01:27:56.288]  In fact, it's bigger than a Super Bowl.
[01:27:57.074 --> 01:28:01.835]  And so they're saying Ron Paul would win.
[01:28:02.315 --> 01:28:06.216]  He's number one in the places if he gets the nomination.
[01:28:06.316 --> 01:28:10.177]  If he got the Republican nomination, he's got the winning slot.
[01:28:10.797 --> 01:28:11.077]  Okay.
[01:28:11.597 --> 01:28:16.438]  Because they break it down, and you can just go pull this up online, it's on Prison Planet today, a new report.
[01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:19.039]  It was actually yesterday's, you can just click on yesterday's news, it's there at the top.
[01:28:19.759 --> 01:28:20.359]  Let me explain this.
[01:28:21.139 --> 01:28:24.240]  If they have the numbers, the chances, or the odds,
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:28.621]  One to three, five to one, whatever.
[01:28:29.741 --> 01:28:33.542]  They've got them in there if you go and look them up.
[01:28:34.563 --> 01:28:40.864]  And it shows how Brownback will do against Hillary, how Giuliani will do against Hillary, or against Barack Obama.
[01:28:41.144 --> 01:28:42.785]  They all lose, except one person.
[01:28:43.045 --> 01:28:43.825]  His name is Ron Paul.
[01:28:44.605 --> 01:28:45.806]  Now, I can already tell you that.
[01:28:45.846 --> 01:28:46.606]  It's not hard.
[01:28:47.936 --> 01:28:59.018]  Only Ron Paul is anti-war, pro-gun, pro-border, pro-national sovereignty, and Las Vegas indexed all his policies and looked at the real polls and said, this guy's a dream candidate!
[01:28:59.614 --> 01:29:00.955]  He'll get everybody voting for him.
[01:29:01.155 --> 01:29:03.216]  He's a true populist.
[01:29:03.317 --> 01:29:06.999]  A true paleo-conservative populist that Democrats will vote for.
[01:29:07.299 --> 01:29:08.800]  He's somebody who can bring the country together.
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:10.581]  He's somebody who reflects the polls.
[01:29:10.962 --> 01:29:18.627]  He's actually with the people on every major polling issue, while the Republicans and the Democrats are against the people on every single issue.
[01:29:19.167 --> 01:29:25.451]  So, for all Republicans out there, there is no way any other Republican is going to beat Hillary Clinton.
[01:29:26.352 --> 01:29:28.053]  There's no way in Hades.
[01:29:28.193 --> 01:29:29.154]  Okay?
[01:29:30.871 --> 01:29:32.372]  That's why they're attacking Ron Paul.
[01:29:32.692 --> 01:29:37.296]  They're supposed to hand the baton off to her or Barack Obama, her VP.
[01:29:37.536 --> 01:29:38.676]  I told you that months ago now.
[01:29:38.696 --> 01:29:41.218]  Newt Gingrich is saying it, you know this.
[01:29:41.278 --> 01:29:42.659]  And again, it's not that I'm that smart.
[01:29:42.939 --> 01:29:44.020]  This is basic stuff.
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:45.281]  We'll come back, gentlemen.
[01:29:45.301 --> 01:29:45.901]  Some final calls.
[01:29:45.921 --> 01:29:47.002]  Give us some foot-and-mouth news.
[01:29:47.282 --> 01:29:47.623]  Stay with us.
[01:29:52.168 --> 01:29:55.112]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:29:55.273 --> 01:30:00.420]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:30:00.801 --> 01:30:06.089]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:30:06.509 --> 01:30:07.611]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:07.971 --> 01:30:16.794]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:30:17.294 --> 01:30:18.895]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:30:19.135 --> 01:30:27.958]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:30:28.358 --> 01:30:30.458]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:30:32.199 --> 01:30:32.960]  Keep it natural.
[01:30:33.281 --> 01:30:41.411]  Call CalBin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[01:30:41.691 --> 01:30:45.856]  Try CalBin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[01:30:45.876 --> 01:30:47.178]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:30:52.208 --> 01:30:54.831]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:55.232 --> 01:31:00.218]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:00.558 --> 01:31:02.321]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:02.621 --> 01:31:06.766]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.581]  We're good to go.
[01:31:30.598 --> 01:31:31.598]  How much will you need?
[01:31:31.818 --> 01:31:32.439]  We don't know.
[01:31:32.719 --> 01:31:33.639]  How much do you want?
[01:31:33.819 --> 01:31:34.579]  All you can get.
[01:31:34.759 --> 01:31:35.599]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:35.859 --> 01:31:38.620]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:42.301]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:42.321 --> 01:31:42.961]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:51.972 --> 01:31:52.232]  And you?
[01:31:52.553 --> 01:31:55.735]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:31:55.775 --> 01:31:59.798]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:31:59.938 --> 01:32:02.500]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:04.902]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:32:05.082 --> 01:32:13.529]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:32:13.589 --> 01:32:14.910]  The brookie light is different.
[01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:19.053]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:32:19.053 --> 01:32:19.653]  We're good to go!
[01:32:39.445 --> 01:32:44.409]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.
[01:32:44.429 --> 01:32:49.673]  888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:32:49.833 --> 01:32:51.074]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:52.761]  You know the drill.
[01:32:53.041 --> 01:32:54.662]  Just a pill to get through the flight.
[01:32:54.862 --> 01:32:55.983]  Or maybe a glass of wine.
[01:32:56.283 --> 01:33:00.126]  Maybe an antidepressant to help control your anxiety and depression.
[01:33:00.346 --> 01:33:03.128]  Maybe a nerve pill here and there just to help you cope.
[01:33:03.329 --> 01:33:05.490]  Maybe a drink at night just to take the edge off.
[01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:07.852]  And that second drink, well, who's counting?
[01:33:08.032 --> 01:33:11.695]  But nobody knows how much you worry, how stressed out you are, how anxious you are.
[01:33:11.735 --> 01:33:12.796]  Inadequate you feel.
[01:33:13.156 --> 01:33:17.738]  Nobody understands the fear you have, the lack of satisfaction in your life, the loneliness.
[01:33:18.058 --> 01:33:18.999]  Well, I understand.
[01:33:19.399 --> 01:33:21.600]  I'm Lucinda Bassett, founder of the Midwest Center.
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:25.602]  I suffered for over 20 years with anxiety, depression, panic, and stress.
[01:33:26.042 --> 01:33:28.703]  Maybe you don't have to depend on medication and alcohol.
[01:33:28.923 --> 01:33:31.865]  There's a better, long-lasting, healthy way to help yourself.
[01:33:32.085 --> 01:33:36.547]  Please call right now and let me send you a powerful free tape that could change your life.
[01:33:36.807 --> 01:33:39.688]  Call now and we'll send you this wonderful free tape.
[01:33:39.868 --> 01:33:40.248]  Call 800-422-0488.
[01:33:40.268 --> 01:33:40.328]  1-800-422-0488.
[01:33:40.348 --> 01:33:40.408]  1-800-422-0488.
[01:33:40.428 --> 01:33:41.709]  You're listening to GCN.
[01:33:41.729 --> 01:33:43.189]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:33:43.249 --> 01:33:45.210]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:34:07.651 --> 01:34:08.512]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:08.532 --> 01:34:19.325]  Alright, I'm going to blister a bunch of calls, but before I do that, I want to invite all the listeners of this radio program, depending on where you're listening, it doesn't matter whether it's AM, FM, 4, the internet, satellite.
[01:34:20.523 --> 01:34:23.484]  If you do have internet connection, get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:34:23.504 --> 01:34:24.805]  It's 15 cents a day.
[01:34:25.325 --> 01:34:34.128]  You can download my new film, Terror Storm Special Edition, for the 17 minutes of added footage documenting 9-11 as an inside job at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:34.208 --> 01:34:38.129]  Basically, the cost that it is for us to stream it out to you is super high quality.
[01:34:38.449 --> 01:34:39.970]  We've got it in Flash, Windows,
[01:34:42.145 --> 01:34:49.928]  A bunch of other different players in the highest quality, in the high bandwidth, medium bandwidth, and low bandwidth at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:50.268 --> 01:34:54.429]  And a monthly membership is the cost of about two cups of Starbucks coffee.
[01:34:55.570 --> 01:34:56.410]  Actually, they're going up.
[01:34:56.450 --> 01:34:58.911]  It might be the cost for about one cup of coffee.
[01:34:59.351 --> 01:34:59.931]  Fancy things.
[01:34:59.971 --> 01:35:02.072]  My wife gets in there sometimes for like four bucks.
[01:35:02.612 --> 01:35:04.533]  Anyways, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:05.473 --> 01:35:06.213]  And we're expanding.
[01:35:07.074 --> 01:35:10.875]  We were hacked last week, so we are in the next few weeks launching a new website.
[01:35:12.047 --> 01:35:15.930]  We're teaming up with one of the Internet's most prolific bloggers and researchers.
[01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:17.551]  We'll be joining the team.
[01:35:17.591 --> 01:35:23.275]  We'll be launching a new ship in the fleet in the battle against the New World Order.
[01:35:23.896 --> 01:35:25.277]  So that is coming up.
[01:35:25.317 --> 01:35:34.143]  And be sure to watch PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com this upcoming week because I've done a bunch of research.
[01:35:35.959 --> 01:35:39.809]  On basically how they've got this whole grid going into place.
[01:35:40.190 --> 01:35:43.037]  The different martial law provisions that are being stacked up right now.
[01:35:44.582 --> 01:35:57.932]  And I want to do a timeline, and tomorrow on the radio I'm going to walk through a bunch of this, but we're going to write it up and put it into a timeline where you can see the progression into tyranny and call it the tyranny timeline towards total martial law or something like that.
[01:35:57.952 --> 01:36:08.820]  This is going to be a very important report I'm going to put out with one of my chief scholars and researchers, Steve Watson, who's got a political science master's degree, a PhD.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:12.002]  I may actually use Watson on that, I'm not sure.
[01:36:13.187 --> 01:36:14.568]  But that will be out in the next few days.
[01:36:14.588 --> 01:36:18.930]  We're going to put out like a four or five page report just with the basics for you to let you know just how serious things have gotten.
[01:36:19.450 --> 01:36:26.573]  Speaking of great reports here, this is up on PrisonPlanet.com, foot and mouth virus released from government lab.
[01:36:27.614 --> 01:36:32.516]  Eight million sheep, over two million cows killed, the big piles of dead ones burning.
[01:36:33.266 --> 01:36:37.571]  And they would just come on your land and just kill all your animals and then say, oh, you can't restock them.
[01:36:37.991 --> 01:36:42.396]  Their flatulence is bad for ozone holes and causes global warming.
[01:36:42.416 --> 01:36:43.838]  I'm not making this up.
[01:36:44.078 --> 01:36:44.699]  I'm not joking.
[01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:48.082]  And it ruined most of the farms and people lost a lot of their property.
[01:36:48.102 --> 01:36:48.903]  The government took it over.
[01:36:49.684 --> 01:36:50.725]  And that was in the news.
[01:36:50.905 --> 01:36:54.770]  And it turned out the government had released it from Porton down by a weapons lab.
[01:36:56.156 --> 01:36:58.657]  Here it is again, and it's up on the site.
[01:36:58.677 --> 01:36:59.718]  We have mainstream links.
[01:37:00.078 --> 01:37:02.379]  But what we did is took all the mainstream articles and put them together.
[01:37:02.859 --> 01:37:12.504]  Because they all... I mean, they'll report the most incredible thing, like... AP last week went, well, the Army doctors believe that he... that Dillman been murdered, and we're told to shut up.
[01:37:13.004 --> 01:37:14.505]  But the headlines said nothing about that.
[01:37:14.785 --> 01:37:18.227]  See, we take that beefy stuff, and then we stick it together in one spot.
[01:37:19.306 --> 01:37:20.127]  And that's what we've done.
[01:37:20.347 --> 01:37:21.707]  The government has released it again.
[01:37:21.847 --> 01:37:27.951]  And if it gets over here, they've got preparations to lock you in your houses, not let you leave, have the army out.
[01:37:29.192 --> 01:37:31.133]  And I'm just very upset about this.
[01:37:31.173 --> 01:37:31.853]  I don't know about you.
[01:37:31.873 --> 01:37:35.435]  All right, let's just blitz through your phone calls now.
[01:37:35.955 --> 01:37:37.676]  Who has been holding the longest here?
[01:37:38.877 --> 01:37:40.898]  Let's go ahead and talk to Roger.
[01:37:41.358 --> 01:37:42.259]  Roger, you're on the air.
[01:37:42.299 --> 01:37:42.579]  Go ahead.
[01:37:43.365 --> 01:37:45.767]  Hey Alex, greetings in the name of Christ, man.
[01:37:45.867 --> 01:37:46.187]  Thank you.
[01:37:46.227 --> 01:37:47.388]  Roger in Texas, I should add.
[01:37:47.448 --> 01:37:47.788]  Go ahead.
[01:37:48.188 --> 01:37:49.109]  Yeah, Georgetown.
[01:37:49.469 --> 01:37:52.031]  Ron Paul used to be my representative here.
[01:37:52.791 --> 01:38:03.298]  I have an international driver's license, and I contacted, I saw it on the internet, and I contacted Mike Carucci, my representative, and his office told me that was perfectly legal.
[01:38:03.759 --> 01:38:05.039]  The Congress did that in 1949 under the UN.
[01:38:05.079 --> 01:38:05.260]  Well,
[01:38:07.975 --> 01:38:11.458]  So, when I get pulled over, you should see the looks on the cops' faces.
[01:38:11.878 --> 01:38:16.481]  No, I know, because the internationalists, like the illegal aliens, don't have to have a driver's license.
[01:38:16.501 --> 01:38:17.102]  Exactly.
[01:38:17.242 --> 01:38:21.005]  Or, you have to have social security numbers to have a bank account.
[01:38:21.065 --> 01:38:23.106]  Well, I don't use my social security number.
[01:38:23.226 --> 01:38:26.189]  In 96, the state of Texas required it.
[01:38:26.269 --> 01:38:34.595]  I know, I remember you being down there trying to get your driver's license, and you brought your birth certificate and like a hundred forms of ID, and they still wouldn't give you your license.
[01:38:35.095 --> 01:38:36.256]  Yeah, I remember all that.
[01:38:37.618 --> 01:38:39.360]  They're just not going to identify me.
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:41.822]  The guest you had on gave me an idea.
[01:38:41.962 --> 01:38:45.366]  Let's just go to our churches or I don't know where.
[01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:46.707]  Let's have our own ID.
[01:38:51.423 --> 01:38:55.224]  He's a child of God, and to hell with the government IDing me.
[01:38:55.244 --> 01:38:59.505]  There's nothing in the Constitution that gives them the power to ID United States citizens.
[01:38:59.885 --> 01:39:03.446]  Now, I hear what you're saying, and we went under military rule in 1933.
[01:39:03.946 --> 01:39:05.366]  That's when real martial law began.
[01:39:05.526 --> 01:39:15.048]  Then they've been removing the old system while expanding the new one right alongside it, parallel, and now the last remnants of the old republic are being swept away.
[01:39:15.068 --> 01:39:19.809]  And that's a Star Wars line, but I have to use it, because that's the only line that fits.
[01:39:20.829 --> 01:39:27.430]  But of course, Lucas admits he wrote that off of history and what Hitler did in Germany, and how he swept the old Weimar Republic away.
[01:39:28.031 --> 01:39:31.751]  But the point is, I was using that term and I thought, that's from a movie, but it's true!
[01:39:32.031 --> 01:39:40.333]  They walk in in episode 4 and they say, The Emperor has dissolved the Senate, the last remnants of the old Republic have been swept away!
[01:39:41.453 --> 01:39:42.894]  Excellent!
[01:39:43.074 --> 01:39:49.155]  So they built the parallel system and now they've just removed the old one, and the new tyrannical system is moving forward.
[01:39:50.672 --> 01:39:56.793]  You can get a Belizean, you can get a Nicaraguan, you can get other types of international driver's licenses, and the police are forced to accept it.
[01:39:56.814 --> 01:39:58.434]  They'll radio it in, they'll call it in.
[01:40:00.254 --> 01:40:02.435]  And, I mean, folks, I saw it this week.
[01:40:02.535 --> 01:40:07.276]  I was at a Whataburger out front, drinking coffee in the morning, and I saw cops.
[01:40:07.996 --> 01:40:09.757]  I saw illegal aliens pulling out.
[01:40:09.777 --> 01:40:11.177]  It was at William Cannon in Mopac.
[01:40:11.869 --> 01:40:13.429]  And I saw them not stopping illegal aliens.
[01:40:13.509 --> 01:40:15.910]  I mean, they had like three-year-old stickers.
[01:40:16.290 --> 01:40:17.210]  And I'd watch them, though.
[01:40:17.290 --> 01:40:20.691]  I saw, I think it was like an air cool or air something.
[01:40:20.711 --> 01:40:22.151]  It was one of these big air conditioning trucks.
[01:40:22.491 --> 01:40:24.152]  Had some twenty-something-year-old guy driving it.
[01:40:24.692 --> 01:40:25.592]  And they pulled him over.
[01:40:25.632 --> 01:40:27.052]  They had him get out, boy.
[01:40:27.172 --> 01:40:28.112]  Pointed out the sticker.
[01:40:28.412 --> 01:40:29.193]  Wrote him a thing.
[01:40:29.233 --> 01:40:30.173]  It was out a few months.
[01:40:30.813 --> 01:40:32.873]  And I wanted to walk over and go, hey, buddy.
[01:40:32.893 --> 01:40:35.894]  But he'd arrest me for interfering with police officers, motorcycle cops.
[01:40:36.254 --> 01:40:38.474]  Hey, man, there's illegal aliens all over right here.
[01:40:38.514 --> 01:40:39.195]  You see them.
[01:40:39.215 --> 01:40:40.875]  And I've had Austin cops.
[01:40:41.693 --> 01:40:45.636]  One day, my employee pulled into my office and they thought it was suspicious that he pulled in and they were behind him.
[01:40:45.916 --> 01:40:46.637]  He was at work.
[01:40:47.157 --> 01:40:49.899]  And I'm pulling right behind him and I see cops and he's in handcuffs.
[01:40:50.819 --> 01:40:53.201]  And the cop, the Austin cops go, Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:40:53.261 --> 01:40:53.902]  Oh, we like the show.
[01:40:53.962 --> 01:40:55.283]  And I'm going, that's real funny.
[01:40:55.563 --> 01:40:56.443]  No, no, we really like it.
[01:40:56.463 --> 01:40:58.905]  And I go, but if he was an illegal alien, you'd let him go.
[01:40:58.925 --> 01:41:02.227]  And he goes, we don't like it, Alex, but yes, we're pretty much encouraged to let him go.
[01:41:02.267 --> 01:41:04.869]  And even if we do, the judge just gives him like a $50 fine.
[01:41:05.189 --> 01:41:05.390]  Yeah.
[01:41:06.831 --> 01:41:10.213]  But you're taking my employee to jail for a, uh,
[01:41:11.101 --> 01:41:11.902]  Expired license.
[01:41:12.422 --> 01:41:14.183]  And he goes, well, she made that decision, Alex.
[01:41:14.243 --> 01:41:18.145]  It was another, it was three cops there by then, and she was giving me a dirty look.
[01:41:18.205 --> 01:41:20.847]  And I said to her, I said, if he was an illegal alien, you wouldn't let him go.
[01:41:20.887 --> 01:41:23.328]  And she kind of drove off with him towards the hush cow.
[01:41:23.609 --> 01:41:24.529]  But I'm already digressing.
[01:41:24.549 --> 01:41:26.150]  I said, I'd take calls and they're fully loaded.
[01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:28.492]  But I mean, how do you cover each subject?
[01:41:28.512 --> 01:41:29.792]  See, I could talk for hours about that.
[01:41:30.353 --> 01:41:31.593]  Illegal aliens are above us.
[01:41:31.694 --> 01:41:32.394]  I mean, it's a fact.
[01:41:32.954 --> 01:41:33.455]  I'm sorry.
[01:41:33.555 --> 01:41:34.595]  I mean, I'm just going to tell the truth here.
[01:41:34.935 --> 01:41:35.676]  And I'm tired of it.
[01:41:36.338 --> 01:41:40.824]  Uh, let's go ahead and, um, they catch him with Moda, they catch him with liquor, they let him go.
[01:41:40.844 --> 01:41:41.786]  I'm tired of it!
[01:41:42.587 --> 01:41:47.894]  Uh, let's go ahead and, um, take another call from somebody in Austin, Texas, in Hyde Park.
[01:41:48.255 --> 01:41:49.917]  North American Union, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:41:50.769 --> 01:41:51.069]  Alex!
[01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:51.790]  Hello?
[01:41:52.090 --> 01:41:52.571]  Thank you.
[01:41:52.591 --> 01:41:53.471]  I've been holding, man.
[01:41:53.972 --> 01:41:55.533]  Let's talk about the North American Union.
[01:41:55.573 --> 01:41:56.754]  That's our next challenge.
[01:41:56.774 --> 01:41:57.995]  The news says it doesn't exist.
[01:41:58.055 --> 01:41:58.575]  I believe them.
[01:41:58.616 --> 01:41:59.616]  You know it exists.
[01:41:59.716 --> 01:42:01.798]  No, the government's good.
[01:42:01.858 --> 01:42:02.559]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:42:02.579 --> 01:42:03.159]  Yes, I know it exists.
[01:42:03.179 --> 01:42:04.700]  Your buddy Ron Paul says it exists.
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:05.941]  You know we're going to have the Amaro.
[01:42:05.961 --> 01:42:07.963]  We don't have to worry about the weak dollar.
[01:42:08.203 --> 01:42:09.204]  You talk about the Constitution.
[01:42:09.244 --> 01:42:10.865]  We're not going to have a Constitution.
[01:42:10.945 --> 01:42:14.689]  Our sovereignty's gone with this North American Union.
[01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:16.510]  So that's what the next wake-up call is.
[01:42:16.630 --> 01:42:19.171]  My new film is about the North American Union.
[01:42:19.631 --> 01:42:22.572]  The first half and the second half is the eugenics, how they want to kill us.
[01:42:23.552 --> 01:42:25.453]  Openly, I have all their documents, how they want to kill all of us.
[01:42:26.833 --> 01:42:27.513]  All right, Eric.
[01:42:27.613 --> 01:42:30.874]  I mean, Alex, you keep fighting the good fight.
[01:42:30.894 --> 01:42:31.635]  I will, my friend.
[01:42:31.675 --> 01:42:33.055]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:42:33.095 --> 01:42:35.196]  Let's go ahead and talk to somebody in New York.
[01:42:35.616 --> 01:42:37.456]  A question about William Cooper.
[01:42:37.777 --> 01:42:38.297]  You're on the air.
[01:42:38.337 --> 01:42:38.697]  Go ahead.
[01:42:38.717 --> 01:42:41.078]  Alex, this is John Mullon.
[01:42:41.558 --> 01:42:41.898]  All right.
[01:42:42.865 --> 01:42:45.148]  It's a comedy call, I'm not going to take it.
[01:42:45.508 --> 01:42:47.130]  Let's talk to Rodney in Texas.
[01:42:47.170 --> 01:42:48.071]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:42:48.532 --> 01:42:52.937]  Hey Alex, I was just reading today's edition of the Kansas City Star.
[01:42:53.778 --> 01:43:03.265]  I'm going to tell you something that you already know, because you've talked about how both the Democrats and Republicans are both... Let me guess, Hillary on Fox News payroll?
[01:43:03.525 --> 01:43:03.865]  That one?
[01:43:04.325 --> 01:43:13.452]  No, no, it's talking about as far back as 1969, it was revealed that Dick Cheney was the press secretary for Ted Kennedy.
[01:43:14.492 --> 01:43:18.015]  And when they approached Cheney about it, he tried to
[01:43:21.722 --> 01:43:25.685]  I had seen that once and seen where Cheney denied it, but now it's confirmed?
[01:43:25.705 --> 01:43:28.488]  It's one team.
[01:43:28.788 --> 01:43:32.351]  Hillary and them were vacationing with the Bushes before Clinton ran.
[01:43:32.731 --> 01:43:35.934]  All staged folks.
[01:43:36.154 --> 01:43:39.137]  It's like the CFR publishes Limbaugh's books.
[01:43:39.978 --> 01:43:41.259]  And he says he doesn't exist on air.
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:43.841]  It's all a big joke.
[01:43:46.013 --> 01:43:46.654]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:43:46.934 --> 01:43:47.254]  Yes, Alex.
[01:43:47.295 --> 01:43:50.798]  You talk about the drugs being imported by the CIA and government.
[01:43:50.818 --> 01:43:51.319]  And one more thing.
[01:44:07.406 --> 01:44:10.928]  You got the local police teaching the kids how to use the drugs.
[01:44:11.088 --> 01:44:13.810]  Well, actually, they've done major psychological studies.
[01:44:14.070 --> 01:44:16.651]  Like when they have anti-smoking campaigns, smoking goes up.
[01:44:17.051 --> 01:44:18.132]  In Europe, saying don't smoke.
[01:44:18.532 --> 01:44:19.093]  Same thing here.
[01:44:19.193 --> 01:44:20.653]  Absolutely, the cops don't know that.
[01:44:20.874 --> 01:44:25.216]  But it actually makes kids, like suicide education in schools, how to not commit suicide.
[01:44:25.456 --> 01:44:26.637]  Kids never thought of suicide.
[01:44:26.997 --> 01:44:29.819]  Don't hang a rope around your neck and choke yourself when you're depressed.
[01:44:30.099 --> 01:44:32.200]  Well, the young girls think that's what they're supposed to do, they go do it.
[01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:33.860]  God bless you all!
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:39.802]  See you back next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., and we'll see you at PrisonPlanet.com as we fight the New World Order and make history!
[01:44:42.203 --> 01:44:43.383]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:44:43.483 --> 01:44:48.305]  Over the years, Genesis Communications Network has grown by leaps and bounds, reaching millions of listeners.
[01:44:48.405 --> 01:44:51.286]  The impact on political and social issues have been enormous.
[01:44:51.426 --> 01:44:55.447]  Businesses associated with the network have grown to become valuable enterprises.
[01:44:55.747 --> 01:45:01.709]  If you are accredited and have an entrepreneurial spirit, national radio may be the opportunity you're looking for.
[01:45:01.949 --> 01:45:05.953]  Call me today at 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[01:45:06.653 --> 01:45:11.057]  For more information, that's 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[01:45:13.439 --> 01:45:14.500]  Looking for profits?
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:15.902]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:45:16.242 --> 01:45:19.465]  The $10 Olympic Commemorative Gold Coin offers both.
[01:45:19.505 --> 01:45:23.228]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a Gold Series mintage under $600,000,
[01:45:24.489 --> 01:45:25.030]  That's right.
