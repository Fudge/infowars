[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.021]  Bidding talk rates.
[00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:06.528]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:08.269]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.070]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.551]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:14.192]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.212 --> 00:00:17.774]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:22.136]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:33.439]  Oh, yeah.
[00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:09.349]  Wake up boys, there's a light at the window.
[00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:14.434]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:20.939]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet.
[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.183]  And they whisper the word, Alex Jones.
[00:01:26.904 --> 00:01:30.848]  There are men coming down from the valley.
[00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:47.854]  There are tall ships flying off the coast And they carry the light in the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind Alex!
[00:01:49.735 --> 00:01:59.097]  Bring my gun and a handful of silver By the sea we will gather for the fight
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:16.707]  It's been so many years So many tears We have lost once before Now we'll settle the score When our cannons will roar Revolution!
[00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:39.043]  We're good to go.
[00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:27.414]  Let us march this road on the rocky hills tonight Under cover of the darkness We will slip behind their eyes And we will take the men who have stolen our lands For the years of domination Get them right between your eyes
[00:03:42.042 --> 00:03:42.524]  Yeah.
[00:04:36.558 --> 00:04:52.580]  Roll away the dawn Roll away the dawn and let me see The land of the free Has anything changed now?
[00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:56.221]  Sweet liberty
[00:05:01.165 --> 00:05:04.186]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:05:04.507 --> 00:05:07.008]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals?
[00:05:08.268 --> 00:05:09.329]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:12.410]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.851]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:05:17.252 --> 00:05:18.092]  So what do you do?
[00:05:18.412 --> 00:05:22.974]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:05:23.454 --> 00:05:25.595]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:26.975]  Sheltering in Place!
[00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:40.778]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:05:40.818 --> 00:05:47.860]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.646]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:05:53.087 --> 00:05:55.149]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.971]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:57.392]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:06.770]  It's a fact.
[00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:14.060]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:06:14.101 --> 00:06:22.673]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making us all slaves to our creditors.
[00:06:22.933 --> 00:06:33.359]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:39.523]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:06:39.603 --> 00:06:44.566]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:06:44.646 --> 00:06:49.189]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:49.609]  I think so.
[00:07:06.724 --> 00:07:08.005]  Unbearable money pressures.
[00:07:08.085 --> 00:07:09.646]  Deteriorating health conditions.
[00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:16.151]  Are political uncertainties and a world spinning out of control keeping you from getting the restful sleep your body desperately needs?
[00:07:16.511 --> 00:07:16.971]  It's true.
[00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:22.935]  Researchers now know that insufficient sleep can lead to dangerous health problems, including immune system impairment.
[00:07:23.136 --> 00:07:28.479]  But before you reach for addictive pills, listen to this exciting news about a breakthrough in safe and restful sleep.
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.523]  A new product called a Sleep Generator is now available and is remarkably simple to use.
[00:07:33.843 --> 00:07:37.065]  Just pop the sleep generator in your CD player and hit play.
[00:07:37.265 --> 00:07:37.726]  That's it!
[00:07:37.986 --> 00:07:41.168]  The new program uses sleep-inducing sounds called binaural beats.
[00:07:41.488 --> 00:07:48.873]  These scientifically engineered audio frequencies interact with the human brain in such a way that it almost forces quick, safe, and non-addictive sleep.
[00:07:49.093 --> 00:07:50.114]  It's just that simple.
[00:07:50.254 --> 00:07:55.798]  Created in a special sound lab in Lima, Peru, it seems to generate restful sleep when nothing else will.
[00:07:55.958 --> 00:08:00.961]  So if you're really having trouble falling asleep, go to www.highspeedsleep.com
[00:08:05.905 --> 00:08:06.545]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.205 --> 00:08:08.285]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:10.086]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.726 --> 00:08:11.566]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.307 --> 00:08:14.227]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.247 --> 00:08:17.528]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.068 --> 00:08:22.130]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.401]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:31.461 --> 00:08:31.881]  Welcome.
[00:08:31.921 --> 00:08:39.765]  Thank you so much for joining us on this 18th day of October 2007.
[00:08:40.266 --> 00:08:46.029]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours and 55 minutes.
[00:08:46.529 --> 00:08:58.556]  We have Sean Kradish joining us coming up in about 20 minutes to discuss news that we broke here on air yesterday on the Genesis Network.
[00:09:00.229 --> 00:09:04.232]  Ed Brown gassed, tortured in deprivation tank.
[00:09:04.372 --> 00:09:09.777]  Tax protester speaks for the first time since arrest in prison cell.
[00:09:10.157 --> 00:09:23.868]  In a disturbing audio clip, Ed Brown speaks for the first time since his arrest and relates how he was gassed by noxious fumes for three days in a detention center as well as being put in a deprivation tank for 15 hours.
[00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.394]  You know, John, I might have sent this to you before the show.
[00:09:28.414 --> 00:09:29.435]  I forgot.
[00:09:29.695 --> 00:09:40.349]  You might want to go up to PrisonPlanet.com and go into the story, Ed Brown Gas, Tortured and Deprivation Tank, to grab that audio so we can air some snippets of it later.
[00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:42.921]  We're good to go.
[00:10:02.385 --> 00:10:07.347]  They did this at Pier 57, of course, in New York in 2004 at the Republican National Convention.
[00:10:07.627 --> 00:10:12.129]  They brought buses in, parked them, and ran them for hours next to the cages inside.
[00:10:12.249 --> 00:10:13.689]  Photos of this got out.
[00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.110]  People were vomiting, passing out.
[00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.351]  It's all part of the enjoyment.
[00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:22.473]  They were pumping something through the ventilation system in on him.
[00:10:22.873 --> 00:10:30.556]  Then he reports they put him in a deprivation tank, a sensory deprivation tank, which is another classic form of torture.
[00:10:32.094 --> 00:10:34.095]  I think so.
[00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:57.374]  We have cases here of people with tuberculosis going back and forth across the border.
[00:10:57.634 --> 00:11:03.136]  One Mexican national infected with a highly contagious form of tuberculosis crossed the U.S.
[00:11:03.176 --> 00:11:11.818]  border 76 times and took multiple domestic flights in the past year, according to Customs and Border Protection interviews and documents obtained by the Washington Times.
[00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.038]  We'll be going over that report.
[00:11:14.319 --> 00:11:19.800]  Of course, the really big news is that Bush threatened World War III
[00:11:21.406 --> 00:11:34.811]  against Iran, just public insanity on display, open terroristic threats to the entire planet, invoking Armageddon.
[00:11:35.471 --> 00:11:36.872]  We'll be documenting that.
[00:11:36.952 --> 00:11:40.213]  Bush warns of World War III if Iran goes nuclear.
[00:11:40.893 --> 00:11:45.855]  IMF says dollar overvalued in another attempt to further push down the dollar.
[00:11:47.831 --> 00:11:52.093]  Nationwide revolt against dangerous vaccines accelerates.
[00:11:55.054 --> 00:11:58.976]  I'm going to be doing a 30-minute report on that today.
[00:11:58.996 --> 00:12:10.501]  The Debka file reports that letters warning thousands of Jewish families in Iran to flee the country ahead of a massive bombardment have been mailed out.
[00:12:11.222 --> 00:12:15.984]  Iran says that they're brushing off Bush's warning of World War III.
[00:12:26.462 --> 00:12:31.726]  So this is just some of what we're going to be going over and covering today on the broadcast.
[00:12:32.767 --> 00:12:46.617]  I've got to tell you that I am just amazed by the quality of news and information and videos and audios that are being posted and the work that Kurt Nemo is doing over on our new website truthnews.us and I was just looking at it this morning
[00:12:47.276 --> 00:12:47.356]  Yes.
[00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:06.951]  To visit the site and spread the word about the site.
[00:13:07.411 --> 00:13:13.435]  And in another program note, don't forget that I'm going to be showing End Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:13:14.075 --> 00:13:15.616]  I just had four showings in Austin.
[00:13:15.676 --> 00:13:18.098]  All of those overflowed and then sold out.
[00:13:18.518 --> 00:13:21.280]  A lot of people were angry and said, please have more showings.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.223]  And so I'm having six more showings at the Alamo Draft House in South Lamar.
[00:13:26.283 --> 00:13:31.506]  If you happen to be an Austin or Central Texas listener, or folks drive in from all over for that matter.
[00:13:32.066 --> 00:13:40.072]  It's a great event, and I'm going to be speaking at the Monday showing, 7 o'clock, Alamo Draft House, South Lamar, and the next Monday showing.
[00:13:40.132 --> 00:13:48.118]  So, showings Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday of next week, and then showings the next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday of the week after that.
[00:13:48.158 --> 00:13:55.363]  And if you go to EmpireWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, you can link through there on the site.
[00:13:56.375 --> 00:14:00.738]  And go directly to the Alamo Draft House ticket shopping cart and get your tickets now.
[00:14:01.058 --> 00:14:05.741]  They do hold 20 tickets back to the hour before the film shows.
[00:14:05.941 --> 00:14:10.984]  So at 6 o'clock you can show up if you want to risk it and try to get tickets at the door.
[00:14:11.024 --> 00:14:13.706]  And people seem to be pretty successful at doing that.
[00:14:13.806 --> 00:14:15.507]  But we've had every showing sell out.
[00:14:15.887 --> 00:14:22.932]  So be sure and be aware that if you do want to see Endgame in the theater here in Central Texas, you can get tickets right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:14:24.938 --> 00:14:38.076]  The film will be coming out via the internet at PrisonPlanet.tv for PrisonPlanet.tv members on October 26th, and that now is only eight days away.
[00:14:39.574 --> 00:14:46.279]  Then November 1st it will ship out to you on DVD and we've been taking those orders for a couple weeks.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:54.426]  We are packaging them right now and they are stacked on a big pallet in the front office and will be shipped out November 1st.
[00:14:56.107 --> 00:15:03.453]  Every order that comes through right up to November 1st will be pre-packaged and shipped out to you so you will get it as fast as possible.
[00:15:03.974 --> 00:15:06.916]  Endgame covers the big issue.
[00:15:10.325 --> 00:15:17.870]  Endgame gets into the central issue that affects society.
[00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:23.074]  I mean, frankly, when I get up here and talk about how big this is, I feel unworthy.
[00:15:24.515 --> 00:15:29.619]  I feel at a loss for words to describe the length and breadth and seriousness of it.
[00:15:30.119 --> 00:15:31.680]  There is a global elite.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.482]  They are setting up a one-world government, but that's only the beginning.
[00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:39.774]  Once it's in place, they plan to exterminate 80% of the world's population.
[00:15:40.254 --> 00:15:41.375]  I know it's diabolical.
[00:15:41.855 --> 00:15:55.443]  I know for the general public, who are not sadistic control freaks with a murderous heart, a bloodthirsty heart, who just dreams endlessly after wickedness and killing and hurting innocents and who hates beauty and goodness,
[00:15:56.363 --> 00:16:00.626]  I understand you have trouble getting your mind around it, I do too, but it is a fact.
[00:16:00.766 --> 00:16:10.211]  And it's hard for me to get my mind around it and realize that no one's made a film, no one's written a book, no one has ever really told the story in full.
[00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:13.372]  And I don't even claim to have done that in Endgame.
[00:16:13.633 --> 00:16:17.114]  It's two hours, twenty minutes long, and then it's got almost an hour of extras.
[00:16:17.595 --> 00:16:21.777]  I don't even claim to have done that here, but I've done the best job out there, there's no doubting that.
[00:16:22.763 --> 00:16:30.468]  And, uh, it is, it is, uh, people that say, oh, well, you're trying to put a bad light on this or a bad hyperbole spin angle.
[00:16:30.548 --> 00:16:30.788]  No.
[00:16:31.288 --> 00:16:33.089]  It's a hundred times worse than I can present.
[00:16:33.469 --> 00:16:37.312]  And it's a horrible, disgusting, depressing film.
[00:16:37.672 --> 00:16:39.513]  But very well produced, very glossy.
[00:16:40.254 --> 00:16:42.175]  And, uh, it's very upsetting to watch.
[00:16:42.215 --> 00:16:43.135]  But you have to watch it!
[00:16:43.195 --> 00:16:43.996]  I mean, I'm sorry!
[00:16:44.956 --> 00:16:45.196]  Okay?
[00:16:45.236 --> 00:16:46.397]  And it's a horrible film.
[00:16:46.437 --> 00:16:47.698]  It's a horrible, dark film.
[00:16:48.782 --> 00:16:50.303]  It is a nightmarish film.
[00:16:50.363 --> 00:16:51.624]  It is a depressing film.
[00:16:51.664 --> 00:16:53.165]  It is a upsetting film.
[00:16:53.225 --> 00:16:54.806]  People are shaken after they see it.
[00:16:56.647 --> 00:16:58.047]  And it's only the beginning.
[00:16:58.067 --> 00:17:01.949]  I'm going to make an Endgame 2, where I'm going to go into all the specifics of what they're doing.
[00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:06.432]  And I did that here, but you'll think it's specifics, but it doesn't even plumb the depths.
[00:17:07.993 --> 00:17:10.094]  And then I want to drop everything I'm doing.
[00:17:10.114 --> 00:17:11.535]  I want to drop the radio show.
[00:17:12.575 --> 00:17:13.896]  I want to just stop the radio show.
[00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:16.379]  Quit the radio show.
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:31.365]  I've seriously been thinking about it, because I could then spend all my time, and instead of taking 14 months to make a film, if I didn't do this radio show and everything else, I could make an in-game two, because no one else is doing it!
[00:17:31.406 --> 00:17:32.446]  No one else is warning people!
[00:17:32.486 --> 00:17:33.586]  No one else has the big picture!
[00:17:33.866 --> 00:17:35.307]  I don't know why it's right in your face!
[00:17:36.047 --> 00:17:44.871]  And I could just make films, but then, you see, I have to self-produce, I have to self-fund, I have to release it,
[00:17:46.239 --> 00:17:50.702]  And, I mean, do you think I like getting up on air and having to plug sponsors and advertise?
[00:17:50.722 --> 00:17:53.104]  At least I go out and find stuff I believe in and think is good.
[00:17:53.564 --> 00:17:54.365]  You think I like that?
[00:17:54.425 --> 00:17:54.605]  No.
[00:17:57.327 --> 00:18:00.109]  In fact, I get sick of coming on and doing a radio show, period.
[00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:01.531]  Okay?
[00:18:01.651 --> 00:18:03.352]  I'm not a fan of myself.
[00:18:03.652 --> 00:18:05.374]  I don't like being well-known.
[00:18:06.574 --> 00:18:13.400]  But at the same time, I literally have a driving, burning, pulsating, seething
[00:18:14.757 --> 00:18:21.261]  Roaring desire to warn people and to warn innocents and to expose these murdering criminals.
[00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:26.163]  I mean, I was enraged at the end of the show yesterday.
[00:18:26.303 --> 00:18:27.584]  Enraged with anger.
[00:18:28.245 --> 00:18:30.306]  And I don't have the energy to get enraged with anger.
[00:18:31.967 --> 00:18:33.547]  Because I was mad at myself.
[00:18:34.388 --> 00:18:35.248]  That was a part of it.
[00:18:35.609 --> 00:18:36.949]  That was the ignition point.
[00:18:36.989 --> 00:18:39.791]  That was the blasting cap that started the explosion.
[00:18:41.903 --> 00:18:45.386]  And it wasn't too bad on air, but physically I became overwrought with anger.
[00:18:46.647 --> 00:18:52.872]  The drive to physically rip someone limb from limb, because I was physically under threat.
[00:18:53.916 --> 00:19:20.593]  I realize, and I see threats for what they are, I realize that, A, I hadn't covered it for the whole show, and there I was, not going to calls I promised to go to, but I had to not go to them because I had to cover that piece of living filth, that piece of detritus, that perfumed, makeuped, quaffed, preening peacock, that un-American, America-hating, Nazi-loving, son-of-a-Nazi pig,
[00:19:21.574 --> 00:19:45.026]  Gun control, pro-open borders, pro-everything evil you can imagine, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who, if he's able to pass the law, that they're about to pass, it will be a huge move toward shutting down gun manufacturing nationwide, ammunition manufacturing, and I just can't look at his face!
[00:19:45.146 --> 00:19:46.326]  I mean, he is an enemy?
[00:19:46.867 --> 00:19:49.408]  My very bones cry out to just
[00:19:50.635 --> 00:19:53.377]  You are a piece of maggot-eaten trash!
[00:19:54.077 --> 00:19:54.878]  I hate you!
[00:19:55.318 --> 00:19:56.819]  You piece of trash!
[00:19:56.979 --> 00:19:59.701]  I know you want to do to us what your daddy did to people!
[00:19:59.881 --> 00:20:00.842]  You piece of trash!
[00:20:02.843 --> 00:20:07.326]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:07.667 --> 00:20:11.749]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:12.610]  We listened.
[00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:17.893]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:18.174 --> 00:20:18.634]  We listened.
[00:20:19.014 --> 00:20:22.056]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:22.476 --> 00:20:23.016]  We listened.
[00:20:23.477 --> 00:20:27.539]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:20:27.939 --> 00:20:28.399]  We listened.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:34.002]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:20:34.403 --> 00:20:34.683]  Again,
[00:20:35.243 --> 00:20:35.764]  We listened.
[00:20:36.124 --> 00:20:37.705]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:20:37.886 --> 00:20:43.510]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:20:43.911 --> 00:20:46.553]  Get the Berkey Light at the American Water Purifier.
[00:20:46.753 --> 00:20:46.953]  Only $279.
[00:20:47.014 --> 00:20:48.034]  Call New Millennium.
[00:20:48.054 --> 00:20:48.154]  888-803-4438.
[00:20:48.175 --> 00:20:48.475]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:20:48.515 --> 00:20:49.696]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:20:49.716 --> 00:20:51.057]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:20:59.767 --> 00:21:04.710]  Ted Hedges for Midas October 18, 2007 Gold 764 20 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $787.64, $388.30 per half, $194.15 per quarter.
[00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:05.111]  That's $787.64, $388.30, and $194.15.
[00:21:05.151 --> 00:21:07.492]  Hedge fund is caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:08.933]  The bond market continues to slump.
[00:21:08.953 --> 00:21:09.914]  JP Morgan gets caught in a
[00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:22.443]  10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[00:21:22.463 --> 00:21:24.685]  Housing sales fell 6.6 percent.
[00:21:24.745 --> 00:21:29.650]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment was spreading to the middle and upper class.
[00:21:29.691 --> 00:21:32.133]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[00:21:32.253 --> 00:21:36.698]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[00:21:37.018 --> 00:21:37.438]  The U.S.
[00:21:37.478 --> 00:21:41.843]  dollar is free falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[00:21:41.943 --> 00:21:43.705]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[00:21:44.145 --> 00:21:46.929]  Economist Roley Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[00:21:47.169 --> 00:21:48.331]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.491 --> 00:21:54.098]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[00:21:54.178 --> 00:21:54.419]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.439 --> 00:21:54.619]  That's 800-686-2237.

[00:23:15.564 --> 00:23:16.024]  We're good to go.
[00:23:39.133 --> 00:23:48.659]  That's 1-800-275-1126 or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, NY 14735.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:53.142]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:23:53.962 --> 00:23:58.085]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:24:01.447 --> 00:24:07.111]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:13.017 --> 00:24:14.979]  We are all under threat in this nation.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.001]  We are all under attack.
[00:24:18.081 --> 00:24:18.582]  Think about it.
[00:24:19.423 --> 00:24:21.584]  But it's not just here in the U.S.
[00:24:22.385 --> 00:24:27.529]  Almost 90% of Brits don't want to go into the European Union.
[00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:38.378]  But the government, no matter whether it's conservative or liberal, continues to try to force them into it and then tries to lie about what the treaties are and then tries to change the name of the treaty to fool people.
[00:24:39.367 --> 00:24:41.648]  And they engage in all this deception.
[00:24:42.568 --> 00:24:46.109]  Over in England, they tell the children, you're going to play James Bond today.
[00:24:46.209 --> 00:24:47.329]  Don't tell your parents.
[00:24:47.629 --> 00:24:49.430]  And they retina scan them and thumb print them.
[00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:51.410]  See, I mean, it's illegal.
[00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:52.191]  It's secretive.
[00:24:52.251 --> 00:24:53.071]  It's coercive.
[00:24:53.431 --> 00:24:54.791]  It's just out and out criminal.
[00:24:55.211 --> 00:24:57.892]  And there's hundreds of similar things going on here in the U.S.
[00:24:58.872 --> 00:25:00.473]  And then I look at Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:25:00.513 --> 00:25:01.473]  We have the audio of it.
[00:25:01.493 --> 00:25:02.353]  I don't have time to play it.
[00:25:02.373 --> 00:25:04.434]  I've got like ten different audio clips today I want to play.
[00:25:04.454 --> 00:25:07.695]  Schwarzenegger gets tough on California guns.
[00:25:08.889 --> 00:25:12.350]  Now, you're saying, hey, I don't care about California, let it fall off into the ocean.
[00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:17.731]  There are 30 plus million people in California, as the traitor piece of filth says.
[00:25:17.751 --> 00:25:21.752]  Well, he's not even a traitor, he's an outlander, he's not an American, he's a piece of trash.
[00:25:23.733 --> 00:25:26.974]  But look at Homeland Security, look at who runs everything, it's just nothing but foreigners.
[00:25:27.014 --> 00:25:34.395]  I mean, look at Rick Perry, he's got the head guy who runs Texas-Mexico relations, he's a Mexican citizen, registered lobbyist of Mexico.
[00:25:34.435 --> 00:25:36.836]  I mean, it's just, we are a nation of idiots.
[00:25:38.122 --> 00:25:39.324]  The Bible talks about that.
[00:25:39.344 --> 00:25:42.428]  When a nation becomes evil and decadent, foreigners come in and rule you.
[00:25:43.028 --> 00:25:44.310]  They come in and eat your lunch.
[00:25:45.912 --> 00:25:53.781]  If they're able to pass this, and they're on the verge of passing it right now, I'm trying to get Bernadine Smith on from California to cover this and other Second Amendment groups.
[00:25:53.801 --> 00:25:56.084]  I'm going to get Gun Owners of America back on.
[00:25:56.304 --> 00:25:57.826]  I mean, the fight's on, folks.
[00:25:58.897 --> 00:26:00.998]  Pataki's suing the gun manufacturers.
[00:26:01.038 --> 00:26:03.919]  He's got a whole bunch of different suits, over a hundred different ones filed.
[00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:08.821]  If they win one, that will make scores of other gun manufacturers go out of business.
[00:26:08.861 --> 00:26:12.823]  We've already lost more than 80% of our manufacturers that we had in the 70s.
[00:26:13.564 --> 00:26:14.964]  Most of the gun shops are shut down.
[00:26:14.984 --> 00:26:17.985]  There's one gun shop in the entire Bay Area of California.
[00:26:19.126 --> 00:26:22.027]  They've banned buying ammo in LA.
[00:26:22.127 --> 00:26:24.228]  If you have it, you've got to have it registered.
[00:26:24.668 --> 00:26:25.909]  I mean, it's all happening!
[00:26:27.416 --> 00:26:38.339]  And Schwarzenegger says that any ammo sold to the state will have to have serial numbers and you'll be registered in the state when you buy it, which again creates a new database that nexuses with the feds.
[00:26:39.679 --> 00:26:53.042]  On top of that, we have the NRA supporting, and I remember I was driving back from vacation through Houston, Tuesday, and I heard local conservative radio defending
[00:26:53.835 --> 00:26:54.556]  Gun control.
[00:26:54.576 --> 00:26:57.299]  Then I heard the news defending gun control.
[00:26:57.319 --> 00:27:00.322]  Then I heard Sean Hannity spinning what was happening.
[00:27:02.344 --> 00:27:05.608]  As I was flipping around on different stations and I again got totally upset!
[00:27:06.531 --> 00:27:12.656]  Because the NRA is supporting the biggest gun control bill that we've ever seen.
[00:27:13.196 --> 00:27:16.659]  They supported the Gun Control Act in 1968.
[00:27:16.939 --> 00:27:19.602]  They supported the 30s Gun Control Act.
[00:27:19.642 --> 00:27:21.263]  They are the people behind it!
[00:27:21.723 --> 00:27:24.666]  And you can't get good old boys to listen.
[00:27:24.926 --> 00:27:25.727]  Even if you can.
[00:27:27.108 --> 00:27:27.348]  Again.
[00:27:28.061 --> 00:27:30.082]  We're facing the total destruction of this country.
[00:27:30.362 --> 00:27:34.024]  I don't want to be on more radio stations so Alex Jones can be a big shot.
[00:27:34.264 --> 00:27:35.304]  This is life and death.
[00:27:35.764 --> 00:27:36.965]  I want to reach more people.
[00:27:37.125 --> 00:27:47.290]  When I tell you, tell your friends and family how they can tune in and listen on the internet at infowars.com or truthnews.us, it's because I'm literally assessing an idea.
[00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.571]  I get on there and I get emotional, but I coldly have assessed Schwarzenegger.
[00:27:50.591 --> 00:27:52.032]  I've made a film about Schwarzenegger.
[00:27:52.852 --> 00:27:55.033]  His father was an SS captain.
[00:27:55.811 --> 00:27:57.772]  That's the equivalent of a colonel in a regular army.
[00:27:58.112 --> 00:28:05.354]  He ran an entire county where tens of thousands of people were arrested and taken to camps for extermination.
[00:28:05.654 --> 00:28:12.136]  His dad was an SS police chief over an entire sector of Austria.
[00:28:13.016 --> 00:28:19.598]  His father wasn't just a Nazi, he was a SS officer in Schwarzenegger.
[00:28:21.116 --> 00:28:27.541]  Ian Pumping Iron, but they never put that in the film, said, I've always dreamed of being a dictator like Hitler and being worshipped at Nuremberg.
[00:28:27.761 --> 00:28:29.342]  He handed out Hitler records.
[00:28:29.642 --> 00:28:31.684]  He went around wearing SS uniforms.
[00:28:31.944 --> 00:28:35.226]  He went around screaming at black people, saying he hated them in the gyms.
[00:28:35.546 --> 00:28:36.507]  It's all admitted.
[00:28:38.408 --> 00:28:41.050]  He went and bought the rights, by the way, of Pumping Iron to stop that from coming out.
[00:28:41.911 --> 00:28:46.534]  I mean, an actual Nazi who wants our guns.
[00:28:46.614 --> 00:28:48.856]  And let me tell you, it's all about power with them.
[00:28:49.694 --> 00:28:53.679]  Schwarzenegger would love to take your property, take your guns.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.843]  Halliburton has built FEMA camps.
[00:28:57.183 --> 00:28:58.585]  They're openly talking about it.
[00:28:58.765 --> 00:29:01.408]  He is the exact... I mean, he is an enemy.
[00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:05.574]  And when I say enemy, I mean he is your enemy!
[00:29:06.274 --> 00:29:08.958]  He is your sworn enemy!
[00:29:12.336 --> 00:29:15.057]  Bush is a sworn enemy of this country!
[00:29:15.697 --> 00:29:19.018]  Hillary Clinton is your sworn enemy!
[00:29:19.558 --> 00:29:21.959]  It doesn't matter if you refuse to recognize it.
[00:29:22.359 --> 00:29:24.600]  They are your sworn enemies!
[00:29:25.761 --> 00:29:35.764]  And I don't know how they've driven the instincts out of you, that when people are openly waging hateful wars on us, that we don't resist them!
[00:29:36.933 --> 00:29:39.374]  I want you to go to every hill and mountain.
[00:29:40.094 --> 00:29:44.616]  I want you to get the word out like you've never done before!
[00:29:44.676 --> 00:29:46.637]  I want to beat these people!
[00:29:47.217 --> 00:29:51.218]  And you tell the churches to tell you to lay down, to get out of our way!
[00:29:51.678 --> 00:29:52.679]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.079 --> 00:29:54.720]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:58.321]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.564]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:30:04.725 --> 00:30:09.912]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:30:10.252 --> 00:30:15.560]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.062]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:17.422 --> 00:30:26.510]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.371]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:30:28.591 --> 00:30:37.439]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[00:33:29.448 --> 00:33:36.395]  You know, I love God, but I love the teachings of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:36.435 --> 00:33:37.556]  The churches don't teach it.
[00:33:37.916 --> 00:33:50.988]  It's about standing up against tyranny, standing up against evil, standing up and fighting wickedness, standing up for the widows and orphans, standing up for innocence, aiding darkness,
[00:33:52.763 --> 00:33:55.065]  And darkness is piles of dead bodies and stench.
[00:33:55.645 --> 00:34:00.030]  Somehow Hollywood and the culture sold you that the devil's all cool, running around.
[00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:02.112]  He's got a hot girlfriend.
[00:34:02.372 --> 00:34:05.215]  No, the devil lives in a pile of stinking pus and maggots.
[00:34:06.916 --> 00:34:07.937]  Darkness is weak!
[00:34:08.938 --> 00:34:09.939]  And I'm tired of it!
[00:34:11.941 --> 00:34:14.424]  And I'm tired of all these fake creatures.
[00:34:16.155 --> 00:34:27.579]  Pulpit prostitutes who sit up there and sell you on lies and this foregone conclusion that you're supposed to lay down to evil and go along with it and that it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:34:27.619 --> 00:34:29.420]  Oh, praise God things are getting bad.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.621]  Praise God that evil's spreading.
[00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:34.762]  Yeah, that's what these churches say because that means the end's near.
[00:34:35.242 --> 00:34:39.484]  What it means is that you've given yourself over to evil and you're already serving it.
[00:34:39.524 --> 00:34:44.606]  You're not defending innocents that are being abused and it means you and your family are going to get run over too.
[00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:52.312]  I mean, why do you think the Chicago mob boss daily wants your guns?
[00:34:52.352 --> 00:34:55.814]  Why do you think mob bosses like Pataki wants your guns?
[00:34:57.675 --> 00:34:59.095]  And now the new governor they got up there.
[00:34:59.455 --> 00:35:00.656]  All these fake Republicans.
[00:35:01.496 --> 00:35:02.837]  Why do you think that?
[00:35:03.757 --> 00:35:06.499]  They want to have their way with you.
[00:35:07.099 --> 00:35:09.240]  And they will have their way with you.
[00:35:10.524 --> 00:35:13.046]  And I mean murdering you and your family.
[00:35:13.086 --> 00:35:18.089]  I mean raping your wife to death and slitting her throat right in front of you and laughing at you.
[00:35:20.431 --> 00:35:22.812]  As soon as they get the guns, they're going to do it.
[00:35:23.232 --> 00:35:24.313]  They hate you.
[00:35:24.673 --> 00:35:26.094]  They hate your property.
[00:35:26.274 --> 00:35:27.435]  They hate your liberty.
[00:35:27.595 --> 00:35:28.776]  They hate your freedom.
[00:35:29.276 --> 00:35:36.321]  They are aggressive and totally ruthless, ready to move on you the second they can.
[00:35:37.555 --> 00:35:44.119]  They're moving on you through the vaccines every day, and through the water and the air, and they enjoy hurting us.
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:50.763]  They move on us every day as they destroy our currency, our sovereignty, our borders.
[00:35:50.803 --> 00:35:57.126]  They do it with malice aforethought, with extreme pleasure!
[00:35:59.788 --> 00:36:01.529]  They say, My pleasure!
[00:36:03.311 --> 00:36:04.772]  And I can see it clearly.
[00:36:04.872 --> 00:36:07.294]  I can see them for what they are.
[00:36:09.935 --> 00:36:13.818]  They want to come in here, and they want to have their way with us.
[00:36:14.579 --> 00:36:22.824]  The same people that ran the ops that killed over 60 million in Russia, over 60 million in China, over 20 million in Germany.
[00:36:23.704 --> 00:36:25.346]  The very same architects.
[00:36:25.386 --> 00:36:30.469]  I mean, I have the British Milner Group documents where they financed Hitler, the Bank of England, all of it.
[00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:35.593]  They want to do that here, and I'm telling you, we don't have to let them.
[00:36:35.613 --> 00:36:46.822]  You know what it's like to watch murderers and killers and the people behind 9-11 in Oklahoma City strutting around, posing as presidents and prime ministers?
[00:36:48.533 --> 00:36:56.922]  Oh, I'm so sick of them, and look how evil they are, how they love the spotlight, how they revel in their fancy suits and their hair all combed perfectly.
[00:36:56.962 --> 00:36:58.584]  I mean, they're just pure evil.
[00:36:59.285 --> 00:37:06.473]  Fleshful, filled with avarice, filled with a false aplomb, filled with love of themselves and love of evil.
[00:37:08.374 --> 00:37:09.635]  And I look at Schwarzenegger.
[00:37:10.155 --> 00:37:13.056]  I mean, if they're able to do this, it will cause nationwide adoption.
[00:37:13.076 --> 00:37:14.237]  Because that's how it is with cars.
[00:37:14.537 --> 00:37:16.118]  That's how it is with swimming pools.
[00:37:16.378 --> 00:37:17.559]  It's how it is with regulations.
[00:37:17.619 --> 00:37:18.739]  California adopts.
[00:37:19.039 --> 00:37:20.200]  The rest of the nation follows.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.522]  Because they're the biggest market in the U.S.
[00:37:24.022 --> 00:37:26.283]  But they're like the 8th biggest economy in the world.
[00:37:29.725 --> 00:37:31.706]  And so it causes universal adoption.
[00:37:32.782 --> 00:37:35.184]  And they want tagaments in all the bullets.
[00:37:35.544 --> 00:37:37.526]  They want serial numbers on all the bullets.
[00:37:37.586 --> 00:37:39.227]  It'll radically increase prices.
[00:37:39.247 --> 00:37:42.830]  It'll create new bureaucracies who track and trace everything you do.
[00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:44.511]  And nexus in with the Feds.
[00:37:45.692 --> 00:37:50.376]  And arresting people who don't have the new ammo.
[00:37:50.436 --> 00:37:51.797]  And that's just where it starts.
[00:37:52.117 --> 00:37:54.219]  There's never an end to these people.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:00.184]  And the NRA is about to pass the biggest gun control bill ever.
[00:38:02.021 --> 00:38:13.363]  It's passed the House, it's in the Senate, and it openly will bar hundreds of thousands of veterans who have ADHD, falsely diagnosed, it's all made up, anyone who has any of these.
[00:38:15.003 --> 00:38:16.804]  Post-traumatic stress, any of it!
[00:38:17.744 --> 00:38:18.504]  COPS too!
[00:38:19.824 --> 00:38:21.004]  You'll be losing your job!
[00:38:23.545 --> 00:38:26.645]  And the NRA is there's... Alright, I'm going to shut up, I've got a guest coming on.
[00:38:32.146 --> 00:38:38.152]  Even patriots, even truth seekers, even libertarians, I don't think you realize just how evil the new old order is.
[00:38:38.732 --> 00:38:42.856]  I don't think you realize just how dire the straits are.
[00:38:42.876 --> 00:38:46.980]  I'm going to play a minute or two of this and go to our guest, who's had a lot of courage, Sean Krennish.
[00:38:48.341 --> 00:38:56.989]  And here's him talking to Ed Brown yesterday around noon, and we got contacted by the folks over
[00:38:58.679 --> 00:39:26.407]  At Make the Stand and we got this up and Genesis of course started covering it and I'm really glad they contacted us to break this and get this out but here's a few minutes of Ed Brown who and I believe him because it's standard procedure and you have to just believe this is going on period because I see these idiots posting on the dig forums and places saying we don't torture in America it's only overseas
[00:39:27.091 --> 00:39:30.392]  Folks, most people I know who've been to prison have been tortured.
[00:39:30.792 --> 00:39:34.393]  I mean, they call it pain compliance.
[00:39:36.094 --> 00:39:40.355]  I mean, a cop will break your arm at a protest now, and then the judges will say they're allowed to.
[00:39:41.035 --> 00:39:43.436]  But they just don't call it torture.
[00:39:43.856 --> 00:39:44.937]  Of course this goes on.
[00:39:45.337 --> 00:39:47.378]  And fuming people is the most common.
[00:39:48.098 --> 00:39:50.098]  They park you in the back of a bus and run it.
[00:39:52.509 --> 00:39:56.412]  Inside a garage is their favorite for five hours while they're waiting to take you to another facility.
[00:39:56.432 --> 00:39:57.393]  They call it de-celling.
[00:39:57.733 --> 00:39:58.573]  It's a big joke.
[00:39:58.894 --> 00:40:00.815]  And it'll take you from facility to facility for weeks.
[00:40:01.355 --> 00:40:06.259]  Or they'll soak your pillow in gasoline or kerosene.
[00:40:06.299 --> 00:40:07.820]  You get not totally sick.
[00:40:08.521 --> 00:40:09.501]  Or they pump it in.
[00:40:09.621 --> 00:40:10.802]  Ed thought they were pumping it in.
[00:40:10.902 --> 00:40:12.884]  It probably was in the blanket.
[00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:21.190]  I mean, the major law enforcement... I meant to call Watson when he was writing the article and tell him to put this in the story, but it's in...
[00:40:22.088 --> 00:40:24.250]  The Road to Tyranny that I made in 2001.
[00:40:26.492 --> 00:40:30.436]  Shomertech, the biggest law enforcement catalog, 3-4 inches thick.
[00:40:32.017 --> 00:40:37.022]  The biggest law enforcement catalog out there has a bunch of torture devices in it, and it says for torture.
[00:40:38.138 --> 00:40:42.781]  And they've got sonic nausea machines to break up crowds of people without them knowing.
[00:40:43.021 --> 00:40:45.302]  Says you put it in the cell block to make everybody sick.
[00:40:45.342 --> 00:40:46.243]  It's so much fun.
[00:40:46.743 --> 00:40:52.206]  I mean, every major police department has this on their procurement officer's desk.
[00:40:52.566 --> 00:40:53.747]  Torture items!
[00:40:55.168 --> 00:40:56.308]  But it doesn't exist.
[00:40:56.348 --> 00:41:02.572]  Just like the NAU doesn't exist when Vicente Fox says it on two different national television programs.
[00:41:02.932 --> 00:41:03.973]  And we have all the documents.
[00:41:04.013 --> 00:41:04.633]  It doesn't exist.
[00:41:05.226 --> 00:41:06.567]  All right, here's Ed Brown.
[00:41:06.587 --> 00:41:09.269]  Here it is from his FEMA camp jail cell.
[00:41:09.969 --> 00:41:10.610]  Good afternoon.
[00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.310]  Ed?
[00:41:11.971 --> 00:41:12.231]  Hi.
[00:41:12.651 --> 00:41:13.312]  Hey, it's Sean.
[00:41:13.352 --> 00:41:13.812]  How you doing?
[00:41:14.372 --> 00:41:16.094]  Good.
[00:41:17.575 --> 00:41:27.501]  I had to jump through some hoops to get to you, Ed, but I want to see how you're doing, and have they mistreated you at all, or are you all right?
[00:41:28.082 --> 00:41:28.262]  No.
[00:41:29.743 --> 00:41:30.203]  You're okay?
[00:41:30.944 --> 00:41:31.124]  No.
[00:41:31.624 --> 00:41:31.784]  No?
[00:41:32.145 --> 00:41:32.405]  Okay.
[00:41:34.049 --> 00:41:35.970]  Are you physically alright right now?
[00:41:37.551 --> 00:41:38.312]  At the moment, yes.
[00:41:38.632 --> 00:41:39.513]  At the moment, okay.
[00:41:41.053 --> 00:41:44.055]  But you haven't been able to make any phone calls or anything, right?
[00:41:44.456 --> 00:41:45.876]  No phone calls, no mail.
[00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:50.019]  I started receiving incoming mail yesterday, but nothing has been able to go out whatsoever.
[00:41:50.799 --> 00:41:51.220]  Okay.
[00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:54.802]  At the detention center in Rhode Island, I was gassed for three days.
[00:41:56.263 --> 00:42:01.666]  One for five hours, one for eight hours, and then Sunday for three hours in the morning.
[00:42:02.546 --> 00:42:03.007]  Wait, wait, wait.
[00:42:03.207 --> 00:42:03.707]  What happened?
[00:42:04.328 --> 00:42:06.010]  I was gassed through the ventilation system.
[00:42:06.971 --> 00:42:07.711]  Can you hear my voice?
[00:42:08.132 --> 00:42:08.472]  Yeah.
[00:42:08.833 --> 00:42:09.974]  It's not my normal voice.
[00:42:10.674 --> 00:42:11.335]  Yeah.
[00:42:13.397 --> 00:42:20.385]  So what happened when they... I mean, did you smell anything or did you taste anything?
[00:42:21.607 --> 00:42:21.927]  Yeah.
[00:42:22.547 --> 00:42:24.028]  It smelled like benzene or something.
[00:42:24.528 --> 00:42:25.969]  Some kind of cleaning fluid or something.
[00:42:26.349 --> 00:42:27.029]  Oh my god.
[00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:31.812]  I was breathing on the floor underneath the space beneath the bottom of the door just so I could stay alive.
[00:42:31.872 --> 00:42:32.412]  I keep breathing.
[00:42:32.432 --> 00:42:35.913]  I think I passed out slightly for a couple of times during that period.
[00:42:36.074 --> 00:42:37.934]  I was crying against the door or something.
[00:42:37.974 --> 00:42:39.555]  Bang and the guards walked away.
[00:42:39.595 --> 00:42:40.015]  Did nothing.
[00:42:40.035 --> 00:42:40.596]  Was it Sean?
[00:42:40.996 --> 00:42:41.756]  Yeah, this is Sean.
[00:42:42.276 --> 00:42:42.857]  Was it Chicago?
[00:42:43.297 --> 00:42:43.537]  Yeah.
[00:42:44.157 --> 00:42:45.698]  How come you brought them guys down to me?
[00:42:46.718 --> 00:42:48.219]  The Dutch?
[00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:49.139]  Yeah.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.340]  It was him, wasn't it?
[00:42:51.002 --> 00:42:51.823]  Yeah.
[00:42:51.963 --> 00:42:52.904]  I had no idea.
[00:42:52.984 --> 00:42:54.185]  He tricked me.
[00:42:56.827 --> 00:42:58.248]  He had me completely fooled.
[00:42:59.629 --> 00:43:00.950]  So now you did me too.
[00:43:03.292 --> 00:43:04.493]  What are we talking about here?
[00:43:05.674 --> 00:43:06.194]  Another trick?
[00:43:06.775 --> 00:43:07.015]  No.
[00:43:07.515 --> 00:43:08.256]  Absolutely not, Ed.
[00:43:09.097 --> 00:43:09.677]  Absolutely not.
[00:43:10.218 --> 00:43:12.860]  Let's see if this gets out immediately and if it does then I'll know.
[00:43:13.502 --> 00:43:14.523]  Oh, you want me to put it out?
[00:43:15.023 --> 00:43:15.523]  Absolutely.
[00:43:15.743 --> 00:43:16.383]  Okay.
[00:43:16.744 --> 00:43:17.104]  It's done.
[00:43:18.724 --> 00:43:22.266]  The day I came here, of course, make note of that too and please log in.
[00:43:23.306 --> 00:43:26.988]  They put me in a deprivation tank for 15 hours.
[00:43:27.728 --> 00:43:28.609]  15 hours, okay.
[00:43:28.949 --> 00:43:32.771]  Plus permanent damage.
[00:43:32.871 --> 00:43:35.052]  Did they make you wear anything or did they?
[00:43:35.072 --> 00:43:36.452]  No, except my clothes.
[00:43:39.634 --> 00:43:41.735]  So you calling me makes us very suspicious, you know?
[00:43:42.616 --> 00:43:45.678]  I understand, Ed.
[00:43:45.718 --> 00:43:47.819]  Why isn't somebody else calling me?
[00:43:48.779 --> 00:43:50.200]  No one else has been able to get a hold of you.
[00:43:51.281 --> 00:43:52.421]  That's the honest to God truth.
[00:43:52.502 --> 00:43:55.503]  Even Elaine's son can't get a hold of her.
[00:43:56.024 --> 00:43:59.706]  I've been trying to get a hold of the... I'm calling you on an attorney call right now.
[00:43:59.726 --> 00:44:01.907]  Yeah, I know.
[00:44:02.687 --> 00:44:07.270]  I told them, which is true, that I've... I never told them I'm an attorney because I'm not.
[00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:08.691]  I told them that...
[00:44:09.592 --> 00:44:15.434]  I'm working with attorneys and we have been talking to attorneys to try to get some stuff filed.
[00:44:16.094 --> 00:44:18.455]  I need a habeas corpus to get the hell out of here.
[00:44:18.835 --> 00:44:20.155]  This is bogus and you know it is.
[00:44:20.656 --> 00:44:22.636]  I know and that's what we're working on.
[00:44:22.696 --> 00:44:22.956]  Yes.
[00:44:24.537 --> 00:44:26.858]  Some of the guys in New Hampshire are doing the same thing as well too.
[00:44:28.678 --> 00:44:33.619]  But hey, all I'm looking for is, if they want to have another trial, let's have another trial.
[00:44:33.639 --> 00:44:34.739]  But let's have a fair trial.
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:36.840]  Let's have a public trial.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.021]  Let's do this the way it's supposed to be done and done right.
[00:44:39.261 --> 00:44:40.001]  Yeah.
[00:44:40.041 --> 00:44:42.761]  Not with a setup like this Judge McConaughey has done.
[00:44:42.781 --> 00:44:43.622]  Yeah.
[00:44:43.702 --> 00:44:46.482]  I'm not allowed my evidence, I'm not allowed my witnesses, you know, the whole bit.
[00:44:48.443 --> 00:44:49.143]  Yeah, I know.
[00:44:52.019 --> 00:44:52.439]  That's right.
[00:45:09.651 --> 00:45:12.633]  Because they thought I was going on a suicide watch the day I arrived here.
[00:45:12.673 --> 00:45:13.433]  That's nonsense.
[00:45:13.833 --> 00:45:14.514]  Oh my gosh.
[00:45:14.934 --> 00:45:16.235]  Yeah, I thought I was on a suicide watch.
[00:45:16.255 --> 00:45:17.195]  Let me tell you something, friend.
[00:45:17.435 --> 00:45:20.957]  You should put me in a warm room and comfort me and try to keep me relaxed.
[00:45:21.017 --> 00:45:22.298]  Instead, they did just the opposite.
[00:45:22.538 --> 00:45:23.098]  They punished me.
[00:45:23.138 --> 00:45:23.818]  Yeah, no kidding.
[00:45:24.279 --> 00:45:27.340]  I've been probably cold for the last week previous to that, six days.
[00:45:27.741 --> 00:45:30.482]  I came down here cold and they turned around and just dumped on me hard.
[00:45:30.942 --> 00:45:31.603]  That really hurt.
[00:45:32.943 --> 00:45:35.605]  You just got to believe that I'm hurt bad here and I really am.
[00:45:35.765 --> 00:45:37.025]  Well, I'm recording this, Ed.
[00:45:38.906 --> 00:45:40.147]  Let the whole damn world hear it.
[00:45:40.567 --> 00:45:40.847]  I will.
[00:45:41.247 --> 00:45:41.547]  I will.
[00:45:42.568 --> 00:45:45.870]  Have they let you outside?
[00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:47.591]  I went outside one time.
[00:45:47.671 --> 00:45:48.311]  It's been too cold.
[00:45:48.351 --> 00:45:49.572]  I'm too cold.
[00:45:49.592 --> 00:45:50.852]  I can't take that cold out there.
[00:45:51.032 --> 00:45:52.893]  This is the Great Lakes area.
[00:45:52.913 --> 00:45:55.375]  The wind blows across flatlands out there.
[00:45:55.395 --> 00:45:59.677]  I mean the people have been, I was told they were professional and they've been professional.
[00:46:00.117 --> 00:46:01.378]  But professional in their cruelty.
[00:46:02.117 --> 00:46:06.660]  I'm sure here the segregated housing unit is a unit designed for separating the people.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.741]  I can understand that for a period of time.
[00:46:09.421 --> 00:46:11.522]  They know my condition, my health, and so on.
[00:46:11.562 --> 00:46:12.643]  They know that I have no ills.
[00:46:12.663 --> 00:46:14.484]  They don't have to leave me in a place like this.
[00:46:14.984 --> 00:46:15.564]  Nobody does.
[00:46:16.125 --> 00:46:18.306]  This is cruel and abusive treatment in the longest term.
[00:46:18.546 --> 00:46:22.588]  I know two other guys that got on this show already and I haven't even talked to anybody but I know they don't even belong there.
[00:46:23.686 --> 00:46:26.887]  There's plenty of young kids in there too for ten months for really nothing.
[00:46:27.027 --> 00:46:31.748]  Hey Ed, did they cart you around because we were worried they were giving you diesel therapy?
[00:46:32.388 --> 00:46:34.649]  No, I told them that too and they mentioned that on the plane.
[00:46:34.889 --> 00:46:35.749]  They diesel me all right?
[00:46:35.769 --> 00:46:36.729]  They diesel me out to Ohio.
[00:46:36.769 --> 00:46:38.630]  I'll tell them I'm not close to my assistance.
[00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:44.751]  Why am I not back there close where I have my case already built up and to be able to fight it?
[00:46:45.151 --> 00:46:47.692]  Instead they bring me out here what?
[00:46:48.272 --> 00:46:48.832]  600, 800 miles away?
[00:46:48.852 --> 00:46:50.413]  This is nonsense.
[00:46:50.973 --> 00:46:51.373]  Yeah, I know.
[00:46:52.606 --> 00:46:56.709]  I guess Ed and Elaine Brown, the elderly couple, really rattled their cages, eh?
[00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:57.970]  I guess.
[00:46:59.251 --> 00:47:05.916]  We must be a real terror to the federal government corporate structure, huh?
[00:47:05.936 --> 00:47:06.316]  Yeah.
[00:47:06.356 --> 00:47:14.722]  You want to go through the story of what exactly happened when they picked you up, how they did it, what the hell did they do?
[00:47:14.742 --> 00:47:15.943]  How much time are they going to give us here?
[00:47:16.739 --> 00:47:16.999]  Yeah.
[00:47:17.159 --> 00:47:19.801]  They picked us up from when Dutch, he swarmed us.
[00:47:19.881 --> 00:47:22.783]  I had the opportunity to stop Dutch real quick, real brief.
[00:47:22.823 --> 00:47:23.724]  You know I'm pretty fast.
[00:47:24.624 --> 00:47:26.646]  I'm not going to hurt anybody and I don't want to hurt anybody.
[00:47:27.446 --> 00:47:29.628]  In the same token I let it go down and let it happen.
[00:47:30.308 --> 00:47:31.309]  But I did not expect this.
[00:47:32.811 --> 00:47:35.873]  So when Dutch Grass warned me that some little cowardly U.S.
[00:47:35.933 --> 00:47:38.655]  Marshal would say something, I'm a little punk kid, he tasered me.
[00:47:39.195 --> 00:47:39.736]  Oh God.
[00:47:40.236 --> 00:47:42.417]  Oh yeah, they had me down and Dutchess had me down.
[00:47:42.437 --> 00:47:43.678]  I'm not even, I'm not even resistant.
[00:47:43.718 --> 00:47:45.880]  I didn't resist one second, okay?
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.842]  And this guy comes up to me and he had me down and Dutchess got me down and he's tasering me.
[00:47:50.543 --> 00:47:51.183]  Oh my God.
[00:47:51.563 --> 00:47:56.847]  And they pulled me up, they put me in a cuffs and shackled me, took me down to the police station in Lebanon, the same old story.
[00:47:56.887 --> 00:47:58.768]  Two armed guards in battle dress uniform.
[00:47:59.108 --> 00:47:59.909]  I think they were U.S.
[00:47:59.949 --> 00:48:00.329]  Marshals.
[00:48:01.175 --> 00:48:01.735]  I don't know.
[00:48:01.835 --> 00:48:02.496]  I don't know.
[00:48:02.556 --> 00:48:03.236]  I don't know.
[00:48:30.561 --> 00:48:30.821]  Yeah.
[00:48:31.621 --> 00:48:35.363]  So she came out about 15 minutes later and they cut her off.
[00:48:35.603 --> 00:48:40.405]  They took the usual strip shirts thing like they always do and they spread your cheeks a little bit as usual.
[00:48:40.865 --> 00:48:43.086]  I've done that probably about seven or eight times.
[00:48:43.346 --> 00:48:44.747]  Oh my God, you have?
[00:48:44.787 --> 00:48:45.787]  They do it over and over again.
[00:48:45.847 --> 00:48:49.268]  Even inside when we pass you off from one to the other they all go through the same procedure.
[00:48:49.288 --> 00:48:52.109]  You know, squat and spread your cheeks and whatever.
[00:48:52.269 --> 00:48:53.230]  It's just disgusting.
[00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.171]  I had to do that once.
[00:48:55.931 --> 00:48:56.871]  Yeah, so you understand.
[00:48:56.891 --> 00:48:58.052]  But try to do it over and over again.
[00:48:58.872 --> 00:48:59.332]  I don't know.
[00:48:59.392 --> 00:48:59.792]  I don't know.
[00:48:59.812 --> 00:49:00.233]  I don't know.
[00:49:23.903 --> 00:49:27.707]  I even told him I didn't want to go to see if he would try to get me to go.
[00:49:38.756 --> 00:49:41.738]  That's what they do.
[00:49:41.778 --> 00:49:42.758]  I suspected it from where.
[00:49:42.778 --> 00:49:50.143]  That's why I called two locations and told them that we have a suspected sting operation going down here.
[00:49:50.523 --> 00:49:52.444]  I said we'll call you back in a couple of hours.
[00:49:52.664 --> 00:49:54.165]  I was with David Weinkleis.
[00:49:54.205 --> 00:49:55.826]  I called him two hours before it went down.
[00:49:56.306 --> 00:49:58.668]  I called Bernie Bash and let him know about it too.
[00:49:58.688 --> 00:49:59.948]  That's what happened.
[00:50:00.929 --> 00:50:01.989]  So I knew it was coming down.
[00:50:05.658 --> 00:50:08.759]  Alright, and we're going to break and come back with Sean Kratos.
[00:50:08.799 --> 00:50:10.660]  Sean, is that the end of the Total Tape?
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:15.701]  Yeah, that's all the tape we have because the recording got cut off.
[00:50:16.261 --> 00:50:19.102]  How were you able to get through to him when nobody else could?
[00:50:20.242 --> 00:50:30.326]  I just set up an attorney call because we're working with a group of lawyers, a team of lawyers, to try to file some motions or a writ.
[00:50:32.828 --> 00:50:39.130]  I'm telling you, you guys need to get Larry Becraft and not one of these Patriot quack lawyers.
[00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:41.631]  Because most of them are feds to begin with.
[00:50:41.691 --> 00:50:42.532]  It's all a big joke.
[00:50:42.552 --> 00:50:43.992]  Trying to give you bad info.
[00:50:44.032 --> 00:50:45.273]  But I don't know who your lawyers are.
[00:50:45.293 --> 00:50:46.913]  But you ought to talk to Becraft.
[00:50:46.933 --> 00:50:47.393]  Stay there.
[00:50:47.413 --> 00:50:49.654]  Let's talk about this on the other side.
[00:50:50.334 --> 00:50:51.615]  And I appreciate you coming on with us.
[00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:55.316]  And then coming up later, folks, Bush says it's going to be World War III.
[00:50:55.916 --> 00:50:56.797]  Oh yeah, stay with us.
[00:51:01.423 --> 00:51:02.824]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:02.844 --> 00:51:04.945]  A new world order.
[00:51:05.665 --> 00:51:09.828]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:10.548 --> 00:51:13.350]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:15.631]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[00:51:16.171 --> 00:51:18.632]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:19.353 --> 00:51:26.677]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:29.699 --> 00:51:34.701]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.161 --> 00:51:38.622]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.002 --> 00:51:41.523]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:41.583 --> 00:51:42.523]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:42.543 --> 00:51:43.483]  They're not after money.
[00:51:43.503 --> 00:51:44.584]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:44.804 --> 00:51:45.564]  They're after power.
[00:51:45.784 --> 00:51:46.464]  That's what happens.

[00:52:06.196 --> 00:52:10.360]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:11.621]  So what do you do?
[00:52:11.941 --> 00:52:16.506]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:52:16.986 --> 00:52:19.127]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[00:53:10.151 --> 00:53:17.238]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[00:53:17.598 --> 00:53:20.841]  Our Founding Fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[00:53:21.122 --> 00:53:24.965]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[00:53:25.305 --> 00:53:29.630]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments.
[00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:36.396]  Loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.
[00:53:36.716 --> 00:53:41.040]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.102]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?
[00:53:43.362 --> 00:53:49.587]  Call today at 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[00:53:49.947 --> 00:53:53.270]  Learn, help, shop at hempusa.org.
[00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:54.511]  We do not charge for shipping.
[00:53:54.571 --> 00:53:55.732]  That's 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[00:54:14.422 --> 00:54:24.570]  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel.
[00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:32.216]  I focus on the thing, the only thing.
[00:54:32.476 --> 00:54:36.319]  It's so frustrating to know there are federal marshals listening right now.
[00:54:36.339 --> 00:54:37.720]  And I hope that
[00:54:40.879 --> 00:54:41.880]  They would listen to me.
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:49.345]  But they're not going to listen.
[00:54:49.465 --> 00:54:53.888]  No, they won't listen to me when I have government documents about what's in the vaccines.
[00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:57.550]  They're not going to listen.
[00:54:59.232 --> 00:55:00.412]  That's just one example.
[00:55:00.432 --> 00:55:01.773]  They'll go ahead and give it to their child.
[00:55:03.174 --> 00:55:05.556]  Just like the general public will.
[00:55:09.659 --> 00:55:11.220]  They don't want to know the truth.
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:13.400]  They don't want to know the full magnitude.
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:16.561]  They don't want to face that we are the bad guys.
[00:55:18.141 --> 00:55:21.622]  Alright, let's go back to Sean Kradish.
[00:55:21.662 --> 00:55:24.962]  I'm going to get into vaccines, the World War III talk of Bush next hour.
[00:55:25.062 --> 00:55:28.243]  We are definitely living in crazy times, there's no doubt.
[00:55:28.643 --> 00:55:30.644]  Sean, I mean, obviously, Ed there's freaked out.
[00:55:30.664 --> 00:55:32.564]  He's been two weeks in their clutches.
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:35.281]  You know, finally a phone call gets through.
[00:55:35.321 --> 00:55:39.863]  You're the guy that ran his main website, so obviously you're the one the feds are going to try to infiltrate.
[00:55:39.883 --> 00:55:44.565]  I mean, I'm not mad at Ed, but at the same time, he can't really be blaming you.
[00:55:45.425 --> 00:55:47.526]  He's the one letting people into the property.
[00:55:47.546 --> 00:55:54.549]  He was using you kind of as a gauge for that, but I mean, what does he expect, letting people on property?
[00:55:54.569 --> 00:55:58.831]  I mean, I made the prediction they were going to come in posing as patriots and do this to him.
[00:55:58.851 --> 00:55:59.571]  It wasn't hard.
[00:55:59.631 --> 00:56:00.712]  Two plus two equals four.
[00:56:01.412 --> 00:56:03.114]  Yeah, well, I don't think he's really blaming me.
[00:56:03.174 --> 00:56:09.499]  He's definitely disappointed at what happened and so am I. It was a failure of communication and a number of other things.
[00:56:31.539 --> 00:56:37.143]  The Infiltrator did appear just like any other supporter.
[00:56:37.203 --> 00:56:39.024]  New supporters come in there all the time.
[00:56:39.905 --> 00:56:44.808]  And, you know, anyone who wants to meet Ed, you know, goes and meets him.
[00:56:44.888 --> 00:56:47.530]  Or, you know, someone else will bring him along.
[00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:54.214]  And, you know, hundreds, if not thousands of people went through there.
[00:56:56.096 --> 00:57:11.822]  Like you said, it was bound to happen, but obviously you can't imagine how I feel after having been the one they used to do that to Anna Lane.
[00:57:12.062 --> 00:57:22.986]  It could have been stopped just with better communication, but now the important thing is getting the word out about these revelations of how he's being mistreated.
[00:57:23.769 --> 00:57:29.431]  In prison, the one thing I'd really like to find out is where exactly they took him in Rhode Island and gassed him.
[00:57:29.911 --> 00:57:31.852]  Because he said it was a private prison.
[00:57:32.832 --> 00:57:35.133]  And I don't know much about prisons.
[00:57:35.594 --> 00:57:38.655]  Now did you release the full tape or did you edit it?
[00:57:38.955 --> 00:57:39.915]  No, I didn't edit it.
[00:57:40.035 --> 00:57:41.176]  I released everything I had.
[00:57:42.705 --> 00:57:49.228]  The only thing that was ever taken out of it was the beginning where I'm actually placing the phone call, but I think you might have played the whole one.
[00:57:50.068 --> 00:57:52.389]  The whole one is out there at places.
[00:57:52.589 --> 00:57:56.591]  Yeah, well, we didn't air the jail guard talk on the phone.
[00:57:58.451 --> 00:57:59.652]  We cut that off.
[00:57:59.672 --> 00:58:06.715]  Technically, we can play that, but it's no point in putting the person's voice on there because they hadn't agreed to it.
[00:58:07.355 --> 00:58:09.996]  Now, I tell you,
[00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:14.102]  Stay there for a few more minutes with me, okay, Sean?
[00:58:14.422 --> 00:58:14.622]  Sure.
[00:58:15.122 --> 00:58:29.966]  We're talking to Sean Kradish, and he runs the website, the main website for Ed and Elaine Brown, and that website is MakeTheStand.com, a chronicle of what's happened there.
[00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:32.267]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:34.108 --> 00:58:38.909]  We're going to get into their black ops against the American people later in the next hour.
[00:58:41.801 --> 00:58:46.026]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:59:05.623 --> 00:59:09.827]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:10.467 --> 00:59:11.288]  You want answers?
[00:59:12.028 --> 00:59:12.989]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:13.610 --> 00:59:17.413]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:17.793 --> 00:59:21.897]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.001]  There are thousands of things that I want to do.
[00:59:31.622 --> 00:59:32.522]  Points I want to make.
[00:59:32.622 --> 00:59:33.863]  Websites I want to build.
[00:59:34.363 --> 00:59:35.523]  People I want to warn.
[00:59:35.704 --> 00:59:37.044]  That's my calling.
[00:59:37.624 --> 00:59:40.626]  That's my burning, obsessive desire.
[00:59:41.026 --> 00:59:42.247]  I am consumed by it.
[00:59:44.107 --> 00:59:55.093]  And... We're going to be talking about some of those projects and ideas and information coming up in about 15-20 minutes.
[00:59:55.693 --> 00:59:57.894]  We're also going to have open phones later in the broadcast.
[00:59:58.911 --> 01:00:06.434]  We're talking to Sean Kradish right now, who runs Ed Delane Brown's main website, MakeTheStand.com.
[01:00:07.474 --> 01:00:13.836]  The Feds have gone around deleting other websites that were supporting him, shutting down their MySpace account, but they haven't shut down MakeTheStand.com yet.
[01:00:14.357 --> 01:00:19.679]  He finally got through because he's doing attorney work, trying to get lawyers for Ed Delane Brown.
[01:00:20.099 --> 01:00:23.480]  No one's been able to talk to him for two weeks, not even Elaine's son.
[01:00:25.147 --> 01:00:35.690]  But Sean was able to get through saying that he was liaisoning with lawyers, which he is doing, and we just aired that clip until the jailhouse call cut out.
[01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:49.934]  And Sean, I know you feel like you're under the gun, and also about some of the things you know that you don't really want to get into, but I wish I could get into what you told me about Dutch telling you how he tricked you.
[01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:53.791]  Only because this could be educational for others.
[01:00:53.911 --> 01:00:57.653]  I've had feds try to set me up, try to get me to do illegal things years ago.
[01:00:57.693 --> 01:01:00.414]  They quit when they figured out I could spot them in 10 seconds.
[01:01:01.055 --> 01:01:03.936]  And they always... criminals like to lie.
[01:01:03.956 --> 01:01:07.758]  And they don't even recognize their own gang mentality, their own criminality, their own criminology.
[01:01:08.158 --> 01:01:10.560]  But I can't tell you what Dutch claimed he was.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.081]  Or... I mean, should I not tell folks, Sean?
[01:01:15.182 --> 01:01:15.802]  Oh, yeah.
[01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:16.943]  I mean, you can say that.
[01:01:16.963 --> 01:01:19.584]  I just... I don't want to get into everything right now.
[01:01:19.604 --> 01:01:20.905]  I want to focus on...
[01:01:21.938 --> 01:01:40.280]  Um, on how they're treating Ed and what we can do about it because I think that's, you know, it's been two weeks and they haven't even been allowed to make phone calls out and now, you know, we find out Ed's been gassed and tortured and, you know, like I was talking to someone else who's the same age as Ed and Elaine and
[01:01:41.019 --> 01:01:48.062]  And she told me that when you're that age, your body just doesn't bounce back like it does when you're younger.
[01:01:48.082 --> 01:01:55.445]  Ed told me that he thinks he's been permanently damaged, and like he said on the tape, they hurt me real bad.
[01:01:58.267 --> 01:02:03.334]  What can we do about it to get them to treat him better, to get better communications?
[01:02:03.354 --> 01:02:08.261]  Because now I'm worried that with the tape out there, it might be harder.
[01:02:08.281 --> 01:02:11.426]  I might be lucky at all if I can reach him by phone.
[01:02:15.939 --> 01:02:31.487]  I have assessed and studied hundreds of cases and just seen news articles over and over again of how they torture people and one of their favorite ways is to soak your mattress or sheets in gasoline or kerosene or to go into the main vent line and throw a rag in for a few hours it's got it.
[01:02:31.507 --> 01:02:38.631]  I mean that's actually what they publicly brag about doing so I don't think Ed knew that before and he wasn't really an expert in torture.
[01:02:39.651 --> 01:02:42.032]  I've been tracking it long enough to be somewhat of one.
[01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:44.673]  See, he didn't just say they beat me up or they restrained me.
[01:02:44.713 --> 01:02:46.373]  No, it was they gassed me.
[01:02:46.894 --> 01:02:48.474]  And that's exactly what they do.
[01:02:48.534 --> 01:02:49.834]  That's what's so interesting.
[01:02:50.415 --> 01:02:53.516]  Do you know what he meant by private prison?
[01:02:53.756 --> 01:02:55.516]  I mean, are there private prisons?
[01:02:55.596 --> 01:02:56.056]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:56.096 --> 01:02:57.777]  A lot of the federal prisons are private.
[01:02:57.797 --> 01:02:59.738]  Most of the state ones are private.
[01:03:00.478 --> 01:03:00.778]  Okay.
[01:03:01.568 --> 01:03:05.449]  I mean, you know, too bad he didn't say the particular name of the facility, but most of them are private.
[01:03:05.809 --> 01:03:11.331]  Most of them are owned by drug cartels that loan them through money laundering banks.
[01:03:13.192 --> 01:03:13.912]  It's a great system.
[01:03:13.932 --> 01:03:14.632]  They ship it in.
[01:03:14.672 --> 01:03:15.332]  Our kids use it.
[01:03:15.552 --> 01:03:16.673]  They put them in their own facilities.
[01:03:16.753 --> 01:03:17.553]  It's great, man.
[01:03:17.913 --> 01:03:19.474]  They get their cash coming and going.
[01:03:20.334 --> 01:03:26.996]  Then they pay them 20 cents an hour on average doing prison labor jobs, displacing the local community that's too dumb to know that it's taking all their jobs.
[01:03:28.723 --> 01:03:31.706]  Then the idiot rednecks ride around going, make them prisoners work!
[01:03:32.026 --> 01:03:33.888]  They got hot tubs and cable TV!
[01:03:34.208 --> 01:03:34.768]  No they don't!
[01:03:35.189 --> 01:03:44.217]  They're giant TV criminal factories where they catch diseases we've all got to pay for, they displace our jobs, and then they get outside and spread their diseases everywhere else.
[01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:46.403]  I mean, the government hates your guts.
[01:03:46.483 --> 01:03:52.151]  They took the blood of hundreds of thousands of prisoners knowingly with AIDS and put it into the vaccines for the children.
[01:03:52.351 --> 01:03:53.493]  That's mainstream news.
[01:03:53.533 --> 01:03:56.717]  This government wants to kill you and your family.
[01:03:56.938 --> 01:03:57.518]  Period.
[01:03:57.659 --> 01:03:58.380]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:01.511 --> 01:04:06.757]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:04:06.897 --> 01:04:14.987]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:04:15.247 --> 01:04:22.315]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:04:22.475 --> 01:04:23.395]  We're good to go!
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.381]  It is a big idea!
[01:04:54.601 --> 01:04:57.262]  A new world order!
[01:04:57.503 --> 01:05:06.606]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:05:07.506 --> 01:05:12.328]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:15.670]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:18.611]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:05:19.375 --> 01:05:26.701]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:05:29.713 --> 01:05:34.716]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:05:35.177 --> 01:05:38.619]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:05:39.039 --> 01:05:41.541]  Bill of Rights makes great progress toward a world government.
[01:05:41.601 --> 01:05:42.742]  Most people have no idea.
[01:05:42.762 --> 01:05:43.542]  They're not after money.
[01:05:43.562 --> 01:05:44.623]  They have all the money they need.
[01:05:44.823 --> 01:05:45.564]  They're after power.
[01:05:45.824 --> 01:05:46.844]  That's what they're after.

[01:07:38.929 --> 01:07:45.691]  I literally burn with a desire to warn people about the bioweapon attacks we are now currently under.
[01:07:47.152 --> 01:07:54.774]  I try to warn the public about how our country is literally, economically being turned into melted slag as we speak.
[01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:57.441]  Irreparable damage.
[01:07:58.802 --> 01:07:59.343]  Critical.
[01:07:59.463 --> 01:08:00.023]  Terminal.
[01:08:00.944 --> 01:08:02.445]  It's probably terminal at this point.
[01:08:02.465 --> 01:08:05.407]  I mean, let's just prepare for crash landing is my basic point.
[01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:07.528]  I am completely freaked out.
[01:08:07.568 --> 01:08:09.910]  I mean, I keep saying that because it's all happening!
[01:08:14.193 --> 01:08:16.215]  And I realize that these are hardcore killers.
[01:08:17.075 --> 01:08:20.878]  And I realize that if they win, folks, most of us are dead.
[01:08:22.353 --> 01:08:25.576]  And I know that's an incredible statement, and you're conditioned to not be able to believe it.
[01:08:25.756 --> 01:08:26.156]  I know.
[01:08:26.637 --> 01:08:31.440]  I can't believe it when I say it, but it doesn't change the scientific perspectives.
[01:08:31.901 --> 01:08:34.723]  It doesn't change the fact that that's the truth.
[01:08:36.524 --> 01:08:44.090]  We're on a weird planet, folks, run by psychopathic killers who know how to lie to us, and know how to manipulate us, and know how to punch every button.
[01:08:45.772 --> 01:08:49.575]  Entire parallel governments, shadow government, black ops,
[01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:54.632]  And we're talking about Ed and Elaine Brown.
[01:08:54.712 --> 01:08:57.516]  Sean Kradish from MakeTheStand.com.
[01:08:57.596 --> 01:09:07.408]  After two plus weeks of looking for Ed and Elaine Brown, they were finally able to get through on a phone call via legal help, legal aid, forcing them to let Ed come to the phone saying he's been gassed.
[01:09:08.072 --> 01:09:08.592]  We're good to go.
[01:09:36.975 --> 01:09:42.618]  We're not paying into the private bankers who take all the payments and use them for their eugenics ops on us.
[01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:45.120]  This is what they get.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.021]  Any other points you want to make, Sean Kradish?
[01:09:47.681 --> 01:09:48.842]  Yeah, a couple things.
[01:09:49.322 --> 01:09:55.045]  You know, we're trying to raise money right now for Ed and Lane's legal defense.
[01:09:56.786 --> 01:09:59.788]  You know, some lawyers might be willing to work for free, others will probably not.
[01:10:00.028 --> 01:10:01.629]  It's going to take some money no matter what.
[01:10:01.889 --> 01:10:03.290]  Have you contacted Larry B. Kradish?
[01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:04.793]  Yeah, we have.
[01:10:04.953 --> 01:10:05.294]  We have.
[01:10:05.694 --> 01:10:10.016]  I haven't spoken to him myself, but we've sent a message to him.
[01:10:10.216 --> 01:10:11.137]  We're waiting for it back.
[01:10:11.197 --> 01:10:14.018]  We did get a response from Tommy Cryer.
[01:10:14.038 --> 01:10:14.739]  He's willing to help.
[01:10:15.039 --> 01:10:15.879]  Good!
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:30.007]  But if anyone can go to MakeTheStand.com and just donate a few dollars or whatever you can spare if you want to help this legal battle, maybe we can get Ed and Elaine a fair trial.
[01:10:31.509 --> 01:10:32.530]  Maybe we can get him out of there.
[01:10:33.090 --> 01:10:33.871]  Something needs to be done.
[01:10:33.891 --> 01:10:44.820]  And then besides that, we need to find out what prison this was in Rhode Island and even the prison he's at right now in Elkton, Ohio.
[01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:54.788]  We need to find a way to get them to treat him better, get him out of the solitary, that shoe or whatever segregated housing unit that he's in.
[01:10:54.808 --> 01:10:57.811]  You know, there's no reason for him to be in solitary.
[01:10:58.743 --> 01:11:01.466]  And he needs to have warm clothes so he's not freezing.
[01:11:01.486 --> 01:11:09.876]  Well, they're keeping him in solitary because it's a higher security level and they're treating him like a medium or maximum security because he's in a minimum security.
[01:11:09.896 --> 01:11:11.338]  They're worried about him being a flight risk.
[01:11:12.119 --> 01:11:13.060]  Yeah.
[01:11:13.581 --> 01:11:16.865]  Well, he's not a risk to anyone else or himself.
[01:11:18.277 --> 01:11:31.765]  You know, the other thing that was disturbing is how they stripped him down like that, completely naked with just a little blanket, and then observed him for 15 hours in a cold cell, supposedly because he was a suicide risk, which is absolutely not true.
[01:11:31.785 --> 01:11:35.887]  Well, they could have gotten him to throw a fit, and we've seen this hundreds of times with other patriots.
[01:11:36.267 --> 01:11:40.549]  Then they'd say he was mentally ill, shoot him up, and then you'd never even see that again.
[01:11:40.589 --> 01:11:45.132]  He'd be a zombie in a hammock that they just injected until he died a few years later.
[01:11:45.792 --> 01:11:47.975]  I mean, they tried that with Mark Kornke and everybody else.
[01:11:48.015 --> 01:11:51.959]  They just keep saying, you're going to, you know, you're, you're a, you want to commit suicide, don't you?
[01:11:51.979 --> 01:11:52.839]  We need to drug you.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.564]  And that's what they do, but they know he's high profile, so they're being very, very careful.
[01:11:57.905 --> 01:11:59.867]  Well, Sean, thank you for getting the call in to him.
[01:11:59.907 --> 01:12:01.388]  Have you been able to get any other calls in?
[01:12:01.448 --> 01:12:02.189]  Have you been trying?
[01:12:03.628 --> 01:12:05.189]  Well, I haven't tried yet today.
[01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:13.196]  We'll continue trying, and we'll make sure we'll get the lawyers to do whatever needs to be done to make sure we can talk to him on a regular basis.
[01:12:13.576 --> 01:12:18.420]  And we might need your help if they try to block off communications.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:19.761]  We'll need your help to expose it.
[01:12:20.722 --> 01:12:23.184]  But right now we just want to expose how it's being treated.
[01:12:24.445 --> 01:12:28.068]  And we don't even know, by the way, we don't even know if she's been treated in any of the same ways.
[01:12:28.288 --> 01:12:28.849]  That's right.
[01:12:29.049 --> 01:12:29.229]  Ms.
[01:12:29.249 --> 01:12:31.091]  Shine isn't even allowed to talk to her.
[01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:31.841]  Nope.
[01:12:32.361 --> 01:12:32.801]  Nothing yet.
[01:12:33.802 --> 01:12:35.902]  So, something's wrong here.
[01:12:36.502 --> 01:12:40.963]  And we knew that the first week after they picked Ed and Elaine up.
[01:12:42.944 --> 01:12:44.904]  Because we couldn't find out where Ed was.
[01:12:45.044 --> 01:12:48.685]  Well, they didn't get a fair trial to begin with and they're not going to be able to defend themselves now.
[01:12:48.725 --> 01:12:49.985]  That's how these criminals operate.
[01:12:50.285 --> 01:12:51.546]  Sean Craddish, thanks for coming on.
[01:12:52.126 --> 01:12:52.626]  Yeah, thanks Alex.
[01:12:52.986 --> 01:12:53.406]  Thank you.
[01:12:53.426 --> 01:12:55.827]  Alright, let me do some news now.
[01:12:56.327 --> 01:12:57.387]  As focused as I can.
[01:12:58.081 --> 01:13:10.327]  And by focus, I tend to get caught up in each article and go down a rabbit trail, but let me just try to go over the news, and then I'm going to get into vaccines, and then we're going to take calls, and I promise we will for a large portion of the third hour.
[01:13:10.387 --> 01:13:11.908]  We may even get to some this hour.
[01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:18.271]  And I know you think you know everything about vaccines.
[01:13:18.411 --> 01:13:19.212]  Believe me, you don't.
[01:13:19.692 --> 01:13:21.433]  I learn more than I knew before every week.
[01:13:24.835 --> 01:13:25.195]  It's big.
[01:13:26.204 --> 01:13:29.167]  And it's finally breaking out there, so that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:13:30.888 --> 01:13:33.050]  For those that just joined us, it's a big alert.
[01:13:34.211 --> 01:13:36.113]  If they get our guns, they have their way with us.
[01:13:36.133 --> 01:13:43.319]  Just like his SS captain father running domestic operations, that was his dad, went around arresting people in Austria.
[01:13:43.359 --> 01:13:46.081]  That was his job, taking men, women, and children to death camps.
[01:13:47.582 --> 01:13:50.485]  The man who says he admires Hitler and wants to be Hitler,
[01:13:51.192 --> 01:13:53.273]  So of course the ADL worships him and gives him awards.
[01:13:53.513 --> 01:13:54.793]  That's why I hate the ADL.
[01:13:55.233 --> 01:13:56.934]  I hate you!
[01:13:57.474 --> 01:14:02.135]  You attack our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, our Second Amendment, mainline Christian organizations.
[01:14:02.155 --> 01:14:09.557]  You get the Ten Commandments taken out of the buildings, our monuments, our culture, our history, that our whole common law is based on.
[01:14:10.397 --> 01:14:12.118]  You do nothing but attack this country.
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:26.164]  And then every time I turn around, you're caught defending Nazis and secretly always involved with them, just like the Zionists helped fund Hitler and worked with him and wouldn't let Jews get out of Germany unless they paid millions in extortion fees to the Zionists.
[01:14:26.824 --> 01:14:28.145]  I never killed any Jews.
[01:14:30.505 --> 01:14:31.946]  I didn't help ship Jews off.
[01:14:32.766 --> 01:14:35.507]  And let me tell you something, you're disgusting and evil.
[01:14:36.327 --> 01:14:37.688]  You're disgusting and evil.
[01:14:37.908 --> 01:14:41.549]  I'm sick of you using the people you helped kill.
[01:14:42.918 --> 01:14:46.040]  Talking about the Zionists, to then attack America!
[01:14:46.681 --> 01:14:53.225]  And make us feel guilty for Hitler that you and your bosses set up when our forefathers went and fought him!
[01:14:53.745 --> 01:14:56.947]  It's the sickest psychology I've ever heard of!
[01:14:57.608 --> 01:15:03.512]  And then because you can blackmail him, and he pays millions a year in payoffs to the Zionist groups,
[01:15:04.173 --> 01:15:09.502]  He's up there when he's a Hitler-loving gay porno mag star.
[01:15:10.183 --> 01:15:11.565]  Of course the Republicans love that.
[01:15:11.605 --> 01:15:14.209]  You gotta be into gay porn to be a Republican leader.
[01:15:15.291 --> 01:15:16.032]  That's what I mean!
[01:15:16.072 --> 01:15:17.775]  It's so humiliating to us!
[01:15:22.299 --> 01:15:30.964]  And then I got the government COINTELPRO Nazis out there trying to make everybody sound like venomous Jew haters so you can't honestly criticize Israel and be effective.
[01:15:31.184 --> 01:15:37.868]  They want to radicalize any movement against what Israel's doing so it's ineffective, which is in Zionist handbooks from 80 years ago.
[01:15:39.309 --> 01:15:40.790]  So mostly you fall for that trick.
[01:15:46.073 --> 01:15:48.614]  And it's just scam after scam after scam.
[01:15:48.654 --> 01:15:49.715]  And now Schwarzenegger.
[01:15:53.412 --> 01:15:56.254]  Arnold Schwarzenegger has angered America's powerful gun lobbies.
[01:15:56.274 --> 01:15:58.816]  And they always say that to make you think the NRA is good.
[01:15:58.856 --> 01:16:01.679]  They're actually, quote, neutral and standing down on it.
[01:16:01.999 --> 01:16:12.447]  By backing legislation requiring semi-automatic handguns to mark bullets with serial numbers to help police identify casings found at crime scenes, the former Hollywood actor, the Nazi pig,
[01:16:12.987 --> 01:16:13.688]  That's only one problem!
[01:16:13.708 --> 01:16:17.630]  And again, they'll always say they're against it, but then not file briefs, not file suits, not stop it.
[01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:20.532]  Or they'll actually support it like the federal gun law they're trying to pass right now.
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:40.361]  The law, the first of its kind in the U.S.
[01:16:40.381 --> 01:16:47.807]  will require all semi-automatic guns made or sold in California to micro-stamp every bullet fired with a weapons make, model, and serial number.
[01:16:47.967 --> 01:17:01.238]  That's a total retooling of all the guns that are sold there that will create the factory machinery, that will create the science, that will demand the seed money to make the major manufacturers adopt for national
[01:17:04.267 --> 01:17:06.729]  Adoption, which was their plan 20 years ago.
[01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:07.690]  Handgun Control, Inc.
[01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:08.530]  said that was their plan.
[01:17:08.711 --> 01:17:09.811]  The micro serial number.
[01:17:09.972 --> 01:17:10.812]  And now they've done it.
[01:17:12.313 --> 01:17:16.857]  One more major heart stab right into the heart of this country.
[01:17:17.177 --> 01:17:21.520]  I mean, if we lose the guns, folks, Schwarzenegger and people like him will have their way with us.
[01:17:21.821 --> 01:17:24.042]  I mean, that piece of... I don't have words for it.
[01:17:25.183 --> 01:17:28.506]  That enemy of everything good
[01:17:29.864 --> 01:17:35.306]  Where is a Nazi skull-and-bones belt buckle on the cover of Time Magazine with that other pig?
[01:17:36.486 --> 01:17:42.948]  Bloomberg, that First Amendment-hating, gun-control-loving enemy of the Republic who's legalized all the illegal aliens in New York.
[01:17:43.028 --> 01:17:43.728]  Bloomberg!
[01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:47.489]  America's most populous state.
[01:17:48.507 --> 01:17:55.653]  Parts of which are plagued by gang violence and leave the nation in drive-by shootings by mainly illegal aliens already as some of the toughest gun laws.
[01:17:56.033 --> 01:17:59.636]  The Republican governor who has broken with the party on issues such as gun control.
[01:17:59.856 --> 01:18:00.356]  No he hasn't!
[01:18:00.376 --> 01:18:01.217]  Republicans are for it!
[01:18:02.037 --> 01:18:07.919]  The Environment and Stem Cell Research has backed previous landmark measures, such as the 2004 ban on a particular type of machine gun.
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:13.702]  Gun makers and sellers have until 2010 to comply with the Crime Gun Identification Act.
[01:18:13.982 --> 01:18:16.863]  The measure was supported by the California Police Chief.
[01:18:16.923 --> 01:18:18.424]  Yeah, a bunch of CIA operatives.
[01:18:19.004 --> 01:18:24.066]  I mean, these people will just put you in camp so fast, they'll love it.
[01:18:25.166 --> 01:18:25.907]  You understand?
[01:18:25.947 --> 01:18:27.047]  They're coming for us!
[01:18:27.587 --> 01:18:31.569]  Now, I know you're not going to listen now, but later, when they're raping your wife in front of you,
[01:18:32.623 --> 01:18:36.586]  And right when they put that gun to your head and splattered it all over the wall, just remember, I told you.
[01:18:40.209 --> 01:18:45.633]  We're just overrun by foreigners and America haters, running everything, laughing at us.
[01:18:47.115 --> 01:18:50.577]  Madeline Albright's dad ran the extermination ops in Czechoslovakia.
[01:18:50.697 --> 01:18:52.279]  Arnold's dad's a Nazi pig.
[01:18:53.436 --> 01:18:57.659]  Now we've got all these former commissariats' sons and grandsons running everything.
[01:18:57.719 --> 01:18:59.561]  It's just total evil, folks.
[01:19:00.221 --> 01:19:01.562]  They're putting hardcore killers in.
[01:19:01.602 --> 01:19:04.505]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:19:04.845 --> 01:19:07.707]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:19:07.947 --> 01:19:14.152]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[01:20:54.201 --> 01:21:02.903]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.

[01:21:17.666 --> 01:21:18.246]  We're good to go.

[01:21:45.937 --> 01:21:49.879]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[01:21:49.919 --> 01:21:51.701]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[01:22:00.985 --> 01:22:06.469]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:22:06.909 --> 01:22:11.132]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:18.417]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:22:18.857 --> 01:22:25.559]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:22:25.879 --> 01:22:27.500]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:30.961]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:22:31.241 --> 01:22:33.702]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[01:22:47.969 --> 01:22:50.150]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[01:23:03.391 --> 01:23:09.795]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, like George Bush, Hillary Clinton, all of them, is guilty of treason.
[01:23:33.826 --> 01:23:37.869]  He comes here, he swears an oath to uphold the Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[01:23:39.170 --> 01:23:39.731]  What's he do?
[01:23:39.811 --> 01:23:43.153]  He calls for total open borders, total gun control.
[01:23:44.194 --> 01:23:46.136]  They passed a law in California.
[01:23:49.058 --> 01:23:50.119]  And now they're implementing it.
[01:23:52.828 --> 01:23:56.630]  And now he's introduced a new idea to set a new national standard.
[01:23:56.670 --> 01:24:00.012]  See, as I told you, they say a new national standard to be implemented nationwide.
[01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:03.134]  Opponents, however, argue that the technology was unreliable.
[01:24:03.314 --> 01:24:04.955]  See, they're never against the new gun control.
[01:24:04.975 --> 01:24:06.615]  They just say, oh, it doesn't work too well.
[01:24:06.816 --> 01:24:07.796]  Oh, don't worry, we'll fix it.
[01:24:08.316 --> 01:24:11.378]  And could be tampered with or used to misplace by police.
[01:24:13.759 --> 01:24:14.720]  I had a Freudian slip.
[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:16.501]  Or used to mislead police.
[01:24:16.981 --> 01:24:18.682]  Oh, the police won't be planting.
[01:24:19.398 --> 01:24:23.481]  They suggested criminals could sprinkle bullets from another weapon at a crime scene.
[01:24:23.521 --> 01:24:37.631]  The governor, who last week discussed issues including gangs and gun crime, with the Tory leader David Cameron, also backed the law banning lead ammunition in certain areas of the state where lead bullets were believed to be poisoning endangered corridors.
[01:24:37.931 --> 01:24:39.172]  See, that's North American Union.
[01:24:39.192 --> 01:24:40.733]  Agenda 21, UN.
[01:24:42.871 --> 01:24:44.152]  Regulatory system we're under.
[01:24:44.352 --> 01:24:45.912]  You understand, it's all happening.
[01:24:46.613 --> 01:24:50.534]  All the UN environmental regulations and controls do nothing for the environment.
[01:24:52.335 --> 01:24:56.097]  All the gun control, and this will force, all guns are going to have this now.
[01:24:57.638 --> 01:25:01.819]  Or they will not sell in California, which is a huge part of the US market.
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:05.221]  They will adopt, and so now it will stamp
[01:25:06.699 --> 01:25:10.622]  Your guns, serial number, which they'll then go track back to the gun dealer.
[01:25:11.102 --> 01:25:15.465]  And, of course, criminals get them that are stolen from gun shops, stolen out of cars, stolen out of houses.
[01:25:16.146 --> 01:25:18.127]  Criminals never have the guns legally.
[01:25:18.187 --> 01:25:18.727]  Very rarely.
[01:25:19.308 --> 01:25:23.731]  But everyone knows this isn't... See how we have a debate with them on, well, this won't work.
[01:25:23.771 --> 01:25:25.332]  Well, this could be tampered with.
[01:25:25.792 --> 01:25:28.054]  That isn't the reason for it!
[01:25:28.434 --> 01:25:31.476]  It's to get more red tape, more control, more tracking!
[01:25:32.117 --> 01:25:33.838]  They've already banned guns in LA!
[01:25:36.295 --> 01:25:43.657]  It's always mob bosses like Schwarzenegger and Mayor Daley and just all this trash!
[01:25:43.677 --> 01:25:45.377]  There's 160 million gun owners!
[01:25:45.677 --> 01:25:47.338]  We don't have to put up with this!
[01:25:48.738 --> 01:25:54.079]  But you listen to Limbaugh, you listen to all these shows, they defend Schwarzenegger and Republicans love him.
[01:25:54.319 --> 01:25:55.600]  You people are trash.
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:26:01.521]  All of you good old boys with your NRA stickers, you don't even know they're the fathers of gun control.
[01:26:03.305 --> 01:26:05.806]  It's going to take you growing up to save this country.
[01:26:06.366 --> 01:26:09.107]  By the way, go to InfoWars.com, go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:26:09.127 --> 01:26:09.968]  We're doing what we can.
[01:26:09.988 --> 01:26:12.029]  We put banners and links up at Gun Owners of America.
[01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:13.389]  We put them up there.
[01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:19.812]  We're trying to get you to go join the only real national gun group.
[01:26:22.172 --> 01:26:22.633]  They're there!
[01:26:22.673 --> 01:26:28.515]  They're the only ones right now holding back the biggest gun control act ever that's already passed the House, federally.
[01:26:29.378 --> 01:26:31.179]  And I'm a little nobody.
[01:26:31.419 --> 01:26:32.960]  If you move, we could stop them.
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:35.181]  Go to Gun Owners of America.
[01:26:35.221 --> 01:26:37.442]  Read all the legislative alerts that are coming out every day now.
[01:26:38.403 --> 01:26:40.604]  The avalanche of the attack of the Second Amendment.
[01:26:41.024 --> 01:26:45.426]  And you can hear crickets singing in the background on conservative talk radio.
[01:26:45.566 --> 01:26:47.187]  Because they're not conservative!
[01:26:47.768 --> 01:26:49.789]  Neil Borch won't talk about the Federal Reserve.
[01:26:50.269 --> 01:26:51.630]  He calls it a conspiracy theory.
[01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:53.831]  He won't talk about the NAU.
[01:26:55.532 --> 01:26:58.233]  When Rice and Fox and all of them are on TV talking about it.
[01:26:59.033 --> 01:27:00.314]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:04.839]  You understand, folks, we're losing the Second Amendment right now.
[01:27:04.959 --> 01:27:06.301]  Death by a thousand cuts.
[01:27:07.542 --> 01:27:16.572]  In Illinois, in Florida, in New York, Republican governors have gone after gun manufacturers.
[01:27:17.777 --> 01:27:19.799]  Democrat governors all over the place.
[01:27:19.839 --> 01:27:20.439]  So many states.
[01:27:20.499 --> 01:27:24.342]  It's the majority of the Democratic governors that filed suits.
[01:27:24.583 --> 01:27:26.044]  And they don't stop with your tax money.
[01:27:26.064 --> 01:27:28.105]  They just keep filing them and filing them and filing them.
[01:27:28.326 --> 01:27:31.648]  Year after year, they don't win them, but it's bankrupting them.
[01:27:32.209 --> 01:27:34.851]  There have been hundreds of gun manufacturers gone forever.
[01:27:35.872 --> 01:27:37.733]  We're down to a handful now.
[01:27:41.056 --> 01:27:43.398]  And I go in a gun shop here in Austin, Texas.
[01:27:44.639 --> 01:27:47.181]  And I get to have... When I'm buying a gun there,
[01:27:49.025 --> 01:27:56.411]  I get to have the slack-jawed person behind the counter come up and tell me I'm a liar about Bush supporting the assault weapons ban.
[01:27:57.132 --> 01:28:01.175]  And then one of his buddies came in and agreed, and then the manager came over and said, no, he's right.
[01:28:01.816 --> 01:28:03.938]  And they still looked at me like I was a traitor.
[01:28:04.714 --> 01:28:06.897]  All these fake conservatives across the nation.
[01:28:07.117 --> 01:28:08.959]  You tune into the show, you think I'm lying.
[01:28:09.199 --> 01:28:10.701]  I'm not the one that's lying!
[01:28:11.001 --> 01:28:15.386]  You're the one that could just break my teeth off in rage just grinding them right now!
[01:28:15.406 --> 01:28:18.209]  I just wanna... I'm so angry!
[01:28:18.490 --> 01:28:21.313]  Because you could save the country!
[01:28:22.734 --> 01:28:25.517]  You could say that if you just stop being idiots!
[01:28:26.257 --> 01:28:27.598]  Stop being conned!
[01:28:28.179 --> 01:28:29.940]  I want Schwarzenegger arrested!
[01:28:30.581 --> 01:28:32.162]  I want him charged with treason!
[01:28:32.683 --> 01:28:34.184]  I want him out of my country!
[01:28:34.324 --> 01:28:36.867]  Get out of here, you Nazi piece of trash!
[01:28:37.227 --> 01:28:41.290]  I know you want our guns, you can have your way with us, you control freak!
[01:28:41.591 --> 01:28:43.652]  You mentally ill piece of trash!
[01:28:43.973 --> 01:28:44.994]  You piece of filth!
[01:28:45.374 --> 01:28:46.755]  You piece of garbage!
[01:28:51.687 --> 01:28:52.908]  We're on the march.
[01:28:53.088 --> 01:28:54.729]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:55.610 --> 01:29:00.853]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:02.054 --> 01:29:03.995]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach.
[01:29:04.436 --> 01:29:06.157]  Look, up there in the sky.
[01:29:06.177 --> 01:29:07.918]  It's Nonnox Man.
[01:29:08.298 --> 01:29:09.459]  He's in a dive.
[01:29:09.759 --> 01:29:11.761]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[01:29:12.061 --> 01:29:12.821]  Let's go look.
[01:29:15.043 --> 01:29:18.225]  I'm Nonnox Man and your toenails need Nonnox Nail Gel.
[01:29:18.645 --> 01:29:19.986]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[01:29:20.206 --> 01:29:20.627]  Take them out.
[01:29:21.258 --> 01:29:21.919]  Let's see.
[01:29:21.939 --> 01:29:26.542]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[01:29:27.022 --> 01:29:31.425]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[01:29:31.945 --> 01:29:34.027]  Oh, I will, non-X-Man.
[01:29:34.147 --> 01:29:36.849]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[01:29:38.982 --> 01:29:41.625]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[01:29:42.105 --> 01:29:45.609]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[01:29:46.109 --> 01:29:57.240]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[01:29:58.436 --> 01:30:01.357]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:30:01.537 --> 01:30:06.758]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:30:07.058 --> 01:30:12.339]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:30:12.739 --> 01:30:13.900]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:23.162]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:30:23.302 --> 01:30:23.542]  Yes!
[01:30:23.562 --> 01:30:25.162]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.

[01:30:58.690 --> 01:31:00.532]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:31:00.672 --> 01:31:05.855]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:31:06.016 --> 01:31:07.357]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:31:07.637 --> 01:31:15.823]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:31:16.023 --> 01:31:21.827]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:31:21.947 --> 01:31:23.708]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:31:23.788 --> 01:31:25.890]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:31:26.050 --> 01:31:30.315]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:31:30.475 --> 01:31:32.638]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:31:32.698 --> 01:31:40.486]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:31:40.947 --> 01:31:41.488]  We're good to go.
[01:32:03.302 --> 01:32:06.223]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[01:32:06.443 --> 01:32:08.924]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[01:32:09.044 --> 01:32:11.725]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[01:32:11.746 --> 01:32:14.187]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[01:32:25.491 --> 01:32:29.135]  Everybody knows the fight is fixed.
[01:32:29.695 --> 01:32:31.537]  The poor stay poor.
[01:32:31.977 --> 01:32:33.839]  The rich get rich.
[01:32:33.979 --> 01:32:35.941]  That's how it goes.
[01:32:35.961 --> 01:32:37.262]  Everybody knows.
[01:32:43.707 --> 01:32:48.009]  Everybody knows that the boat is leaking.
[01:32:48.409 --> 01:32:52.251]  Everybody knows the captain lied.
[01:32:53.071 --> 01:32:56.933]  Everybody got this broken feeling.
[01:32:57.873 --> 01:33:01.135]  Like their father or their dog just died.
[01:33:02.215 --> 01:33:06.017]  Everybody talking to their partners.
[01:33:06.277 --> 01:33:11.779]  Everybody wants a box of chocolates and a box of rolls.
[01:33:12.099 --> 01:33:13.479]  Everybody knows.
[01:33:20.642 --> 01:33:25.027]  Everybody knows that you're the man, baby.
[01:33:25.287 --> 01:33:28.571]  Everybody knows that you really do.
[01:33:28.771 --> 01:33:33.716]  Everybody knows that you've been faithful.
[01:33:33.916 --> 01:33:37.980]  I'll give or take a night or two.
[01:33:39.001 --> 01:33:49.184]  Everybody knows you've been discreet but there were so many people you just had to meet without your clothes.
[01:33:49.264 --> 01:33:50.385]  And everybody knows.
[01:33:50.625 --> 01:33:52.805]  Everybody knows.
[01:33:52.945 --> 01:33:54.366]  Everybody knows.
[01:34:06.066 --> 01:34:08.048]  That's how it goes.
[01:34:08.108 --> 01:34:09.889]  Everybody knows.
[01:34:10.749 --> 01:34:12.931]  Everybody knows.
[01:34:13.031 --> 01:34:13.952]  Everybody knows.
[01:34:14.112 --> 01:34:15.513]  That's how it goes.
[01:34:15.573 --> 01:34:17.214]  Everybody knows.
[01:34:37.186 --> 01:34:40.687]  I tend to get a little negative sometimes.
[01:34:46.349 --> 01:34:50.770]  The good news is that people are beginning to wake up and everybody does know they're being lied to.
[01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:55.571]  Congress with an 11% approval rating, Cheney with a 10%, losing a point every month.
[01:34:55.591 --> 01:34:56.551]  He's going to be at 9% soon.
[01:34:56.591 --> 01:34:57.852]  Bush with a 24% and dropping.
[01:34:57.872 --> 01:34:58.252]  Hillary with a 27%.
[01:35:04.222 --> 01:35:09.245]  Seventy plus percent of the public knows they're all bad, they're criminals.
[01:35:09.485 --> 01:35:10.325]  And what do the criminals do?
[01:35:10.725 --> 01:35:14.648]  Oh, we'll hire more cops and brainwash them, and back them up when they kill you.
[01:35:15.648 --> 01:35:20.811]  We'll build some FEMA camps, and oh, by the way, terrorists are going to hit us, and when they do, we're going to become dictators.
[01:35:22.171 --> 01:35:24.092]  Well, you go ahead and you try it.
[01:35:24.853 --> 01:35:28.975]  You haven't neutralized everybody with these phony churches telling everybody to lay down.
[01:35:30.043 --> 01:35:34.206]  You haven't neutralized everybody with your liberal propaganda, which isn't liberal.
[01:35:35.267 --> 01:35:38.949]  You haven't neutralized all the conservatives with your phony conservative garbage.
[01:35:39.890 --> 01:35:42.632]  There are people waking up to what you're doing!
[01:35:43.152 --> 01:35:50.697]  And the reason I've gotten more and more intense, folks, is just like the last line of that song was just saying, everybody knows that this is our last chance.
[01:35:50.717 --> 01:35:55.181]  Everybody knows that this is it.
[01:35:56.962 --> 01:35:58.603]  Everybody knows that it's now or never.
[01:35:59.725 --> 01:36:08.409]  And let me tell you, I analyze it intellectually, scientifically, sociologically, but then I go with my gut after that and it all lines up.
[01:36:08.469 --> 01:36:13.931]  Not just my intellect, not just my understanding of history, not just my powers of assessment.
[01:36:15.812 --> 01:36:26.677]  They're decent, but in my very guts, in my foundation, right in the seat of my soul, I can feel the evil.
[01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:30.413]  Rising against us, just as we are rising against it.
[01:36:30.553 --> 01:36:49.408]  It is rising right now, and I just look at people like Hillary Clinton and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and I look at people like Dick Cheney, and I look at their masters, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the rest of them, the big organized religion, the big churches, all of them, arrayed against humanity.
[01:36:53.647 --> 01:36:54.887]  I just know we can beat them.
[01:36:54.967 --> 01:36:58.688]  I know we can reverse the corruption like Nineveh got a hundred year reprieve.
[01:36:58.989 --> 01:37:02.109]  I know it's our job to warn people if you would just do it.
[01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:08.031]  It is not enough that I reach a couple million people a week on our Aminefim affiliates and internet and shortwave.
[01:37:08.451 --> 01:37:09.371]  I want to reach more.
[01:37:10.892 --> 01:37:13.192]  I desperately want to warn people!
[01:37:16.153 --> 01:37:18.554]  And I know I'm yelling because this is serious!
[01:37:21.710 --> 01:37:22.771]  And they've conditioned us.
[01:37:22.791 --> 01:37:25.232]  They've eased us in like a hot tub.
[01:37:25.252 --> 01:37:30.756]  You get in the hot tub, and you turn it on and heat it up, and it slowly starts heating up.
[01:37:32.437 --> 01:37:35.338]  And you get in it, and before you know it, it's 104 degrees.
[01:37:35.378 --> 01:37:36.499]  You're about to pass out.
[01:37:36.939 --> 01:37:38.740]  It's the old analogy of the frog in the pot.
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:39.441]  That's what happened to us.
[01:37:39.461 --> 01:37:41.562]  And folks, we're in scalding water right now.
[01:37:42.483 --> 01:37:44.704]  And I'm just saying, we gotta get out, man!
[01:37:44.744 --> 01:37:46.345]  We gotta get out now!
[01:37:46.985 --> 01:37:47.886]  This is burning!
[01:37:48.664 --> 01:37:51.225]  You've been sitting in the hot tub and I've seen it as it was heating up.
[01:37:51.325 --> 01:37:51.925]  I got out.
[01:37:52.285 --> 01:37:54.106]  And I see it burning your skin off, man.
[01:37:54.366 --> 01:37:56.666]  And I'm like, please listen to me.
[01:37:57.827 --> 01:37:59.307]  Let me tell you what freaks me out the worst.
[01:37:59.327 --> 01:38:02.588]  I'm going to get into this right now.
[01:38:04.028 --> 01:38:05.589]  I went to get my hair cut.
[01:38:05.729 --> 01:38:08.130]  I look like a ne'er-do-well.
[01:38:08.170 --> 01:38:09.190]  I have really long hair.
[01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:11.170]  I've been so busy for months I haven't cut my hair.
[01:38:12.751 --> 01:38:14.331]  Can't I ever just tell a story simply?
[01:38:14.491 --> 01:38:16.452]  I went to get my hair cut yesterday.
[01:38:19.077 --> 01:38:30.265]  And all the women, I mean it was like eight or nine of them in there, were all talking about how everyone they know has autistic sons now.
[01:38:31.006 --> 01:38:45.357]  And most of them didn't know who I was, and I turned around, she was cutting my hair, and I said, hey, now when you say everybody you know, and I was hoping that I wasn't going to hear what I heard, I said, now how many good friends do you have?
[01:38:45.417 --> 01:38:47.058]  Oh, I got five or six good friends,
[01:38:48.544 --> 01:38:50.705]  Half of them got boys, and all of them have it.
[01:38:50.945 --> 01:38:52.845]  And I thought, well, maybe it's overdiagnosis.
[01:38:53.766 --> 01:39:01.248]  Okay, um... Then tell me, how bad autistic?
[01:39:01.268 --> 01:39:02.888]  I mean, are they non-responsive?
[01:39:03.888 --> 01:39:05.189]  Yeah, they just flap their arms.
[01:39:05.209 --> 01:39:05.849]  You know how they do.
[01:39:08.702 --> 01:39:12.485]  I'm pregnant and I'm thinking about not vaccinating my son when I have him.
[01:39:12.505 --> 01:39:14.426]  And I'm just like, oh, you're thinking about it.
[01:39:14.807 --> 01:39:17.289]  And then these other women are going, yeah, my neighbor's got an autistic son.
[01:39:17.309 --> 01:39:18.029]  Yeah, my sister.
[01:39:18.650 --> 01:39:23.874]  And then these other women are going, oh, yeah, Alex, I heard you years ago talking about that, you know, Jenny McCarthy's discussing it.
[01:39:24.074 --> 01:39:28.698]  And it's her blitz on CNN and on Oprah and on all these other shows.
[01:39:28.918 --> 01:39:30.059]  That's what's having the effect.
[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:32.261]  That's the power of that celebrity.
[01:39:32.859 --> 01:39:36.120]  And they went and got the shots and the baby didn't get up that night.
[01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:39.882]  In the morning she came in and he had a seizure and he was gone after that.
[01:39:40.602 --> 01:39:45.804]  Now she's done a lot of things to detoxify and a couple years later he's almost out of it.
[01:39:46.524 --> 01:39:48.385]  Which you can reverse some of it.
[01:39:48.925 --> 01:39:49.765]  Sometimes all of it.
[01:39:49.785 --> 01:39:50.846]  A lot of times you can reduce it.
[01:39:52.506 --> 01:39:56.828]  But you've got to get them off the heavy metal laden foods and other things that add to it.
[01:39:57.697 --> 01:39:58.858]  Or it's just going to compound.
[01:39:59.018 --> 01:40:00.499]  And we know exactly what's doing it.
[01:40:00.619 --> 01:40:04.662]  Literally hundreds of top scientists and studies and we've known for 30 plus years.
[01:40:04.962 --> 01:40:08.024]  The globalists knew 70, 80 years ago and wrote about how they were going to do it.
[01:40:08.484 --> 01:40:10.085]  That's what's so chilling about this.
[01:40:11.346 --> 01:40:12.227]  That's what's so chilling.
[01:40:13.528 --> 01:40:22.774]  And so, I mean, I was like, I felt like I should jump up out of that barber chair and run down the street, waving my arms, screaming, don't take the vaccines, run for your lives.
[01:40:22.794 --> 01:40:24.035]  I mean, it's that big.
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:26.761]  And see, the globalists are masters at this.
[01:40:26.861 --> 01:40:27.961]  Problem and action, solution.
[01:40:28.381 --> 01:40:29.962]  They ship the drugs in.
[01:40:30.302 --> 01:40:37.144]  When your teenager gets caught using them, or you get caught using them, they repossess your house, your car, they forfeit your seizure, no judge, no jury.
[01:40:37.644 --> 01:40:42.546]  You go to prison, you work building widgets in factories owned by the drug cartels.
[01:40:42.586 --> 01:40:46.447]  And that's even come out in mainstream news, that big drug laundering banks are behind the big prisons.
[01:40:46.467 --> 01:40:48.668]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[01:40:49.028 --> 01:40:51.689]  They brain damage your child, and the medical system gets them.
[01:40:53.030 --> 01:41:14.678]  But a lot of times when your baby has a seizure, four, five, six, eight hours later, anywhere from that minute to two days later, when the major lesions form on the cerebral cortex, the chemical lobotomy was only meant to, again, brain damage slightly, 20-30% IQ drop, but some it has a really big effect and you lobotomize your child.
[01:41:15.258 --> 01:41:17.399]  Now their brain is still growing, they're young,
[01:41:18.118 --> 01:41:22.482]  And just like a car accident person, even better with a child, you can build them back up.
[01:41:22.502 --> 01:41:23.583]  They'll never be 100%.
[01:41:24.885 --> 01:41:29.169]  But with the proper care and pulling a prayer, it's been turned around millions of times.
[01:41:33.453 --> 01:41:35.475]  And they do it by design.
[01:41:36.196 --> 01:41:37.317]  That's the key here.
[01:41:37.397 --> 01:41:38.238]  This isn't like it's
[01:41:41.152 --> 01:41:46.053]  Or, accidental, or, oh, we thought this arthritis medicine was good for you, but it makes you have heart attacks.
[01:41:46.113 --> 01:41:50.354]  Or, oh, we thought this diet pill was good, but it destroys your heart valves.
[01:41:50.394 --> 01:41:52.014]  Or, we thought this was good, but it does that.
[01:41:52.554 --> 01:41:54.635]  They know what it does.
[01:41:55.515 --> 01:42:03.736]  And when you stop taking it, or stop taking as many vaccines, they added five times more to it three years ago.
[01:42:04.977 --> 01:42:05.137]  AP.
[01:42:07.282 --> 01:42:09.963]  Oh, we'll just put five times what's even needed as a preservative in it.
[01:42:09.983 --> 01:42:10.944]  Oh, you're trying to escape us!
[01:42:11.024 --> 01:42:11.444]  Ha ha ha!
[01:42:11.784 --> 01:42:13.025]  I mean, again, they did that!
[01:42:17.387 --> 01:42:23.429]  But the good news is that Jenny McCarthy and others are... and it's everyone!
[01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:36.055]  They're 18 months old, third round of shots, it builds up to super high toxic level, and then when your child has a convulsion, you come and the cops are waiting and they CPS the child and put you in the prison system.
[01:42:37.296 --> 01:42:40.518]  See, when they went from 10 shots they tried to force on you in a year to over 30?
[01:42:41.359 --> 01:42:44.761]  A decade ago, suddenly, remember all the bumper stickers on police cars?
[01:42:45.361 --> 01:42:46.342]  Don't shake a baby?
[01:42:46.602 --> 01:42:51.706]  Well, there's suddenly this epidemic of everyone shaking their babies at 18 months and they're dying.
[01:42:52.186 --> 01:42:52.907]  Sometimes they die.
[01:42:53.407 --> 01:42:54.608]  Or they're being brain damaged.
[01:42:55.468 --> 01:42:59.871]  So you come running back in, my baby's hurt, and the doctor says, you just beat them in the car!
[01:43:00.472 --> 01:43:01.612]  No, my baby helped them!
[01:43:02.233 --> 01:43:02.553]  Men!
[01:43:02.573 --> 01:43:05.255]  And the officers walk in, yeah, he is!
[01:43:06.454 --> 01:43:10.055]  They always have their special little pets that are in the hospitals at CPS Kids all day.
[01:43:10.895 --> 01:43:12.516]  Special people that like doing that.
[01:43:16.177 --> 01:43:19.778]  And it's just total and complete wickedness.
[01:43:23.579 --> 01:43:28.100]  Or it's a good cop in there, they're just so dumb, like a general public, like, well, she shook the baby!
[01:43:31.269 --> 01:43:36.112]  And of course, they ended up having university studies, but they thought sudden death, infant syndrome.
[01:43:36.152 --> 01:43:40.495]  And they go, oh, it's gases coming off the baby mats.
[01:43:40.595 --> 01:43:41.796]  It's the covers.
[01:43:43.517 --> 01:43:52.242]  No, a lot of children, when they get that first round at a month, you bring them back in for the third checkup, they give them that shot, baby go bye-bye.
[01:43:53.663 --> 01:43:54.704]  Baby go bye-bye.
[01:43:56.169 --> 01:43:57.269]  You're not going to stop, though.
[01:43:57.289 --> 01:44:00.590]  You're going to hear this show and not check into it, not research it.
[01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:05.371]  You're just going to continue the injections because you like it.
[01:44:06.071 --> 01:44:06.391]  Fine.
[01:44:07.191 --> 01:44:07.511]  Fine.
[01:44:08.612 --> 01:44:12.352]  Again, it just makes me violently angry that we have absolute documentation.
[01:44:12.612 --> 01:44:21.914]  So I've been saying for years, we've been so busy, I only have limited webmasters, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Ryan Slick Eisen, Kurt Nemo at truthnews.us, the new site.
[01:44:23.115 --> 01:44:24.355]  But we're building data pages.
[01:44:25.743 --> 01:44:28.906]  We're building pages that will be continually updated with the news.
[01:44:28.946 --> 01:44:35.771]  You know, all the hundreds of articles, AP, how they quadrupled and then more, the Mercury, or how they're... Here's what we're building.
[01:44:36.992 --> 01:44:40.015]  A, there is no law anywhere that you've got to take vaccines.
[01:44:42.177 --> 01:44:42.517]  No law!
[01:44:44.867 --> 01:44:51.932]  But they tell you on the news every year in August before the school year starts, it's the law, no shots, no school, it's the law, you'll be arrested.
[01:44:52.252 --> 01:44:57.215]  They announce it nationwide, thousands of channels, radio, TV, print.
[01:44:58.176 --> 01:45:06.041]  They have public parks, sports stadiums, everyone shows up, lollipops, clowns are there, because the government loves you.
[01:45:06.441 --> 01:45:09.023]  And of course the nurses giving the shots do like kids.
[01:45:09.423 --> 01:45:11.724]  And the doctors locally have been compartmentalized and believe it.
[01:45:11.885 --> 01:45:13.866]  And the cops standing out in the parking lot are nice guys.
[01:45:14.730 --> 01:45:15.230]  Nice women.
[01:45:16.431 --> 01:45:17.391]  It's compartmentalizing.
[01:45:17.411 --> 01:45:20.732]  The kids line up and they're giving their little IQ reducer.
[01:45:21.252 --> 01:45:23.954]  Have an injection to your higher brain functions.
[01:45:24.414 --> 01:45:26.895]  Ah, you'll be... That's why the public's so dumb now.
[01:45:27.575 --> 01:45:30.036]  You've got the fluoride and the mercury.
[01:45:30.236 --> 01:45:32.077]  This stuff brain damages everybody.
[01:45:32.177 --> 01:45:33.257]  Do you understand that?
[01:45:38.099 --> 01:45:41.020]  There's a reason cops, when they make you take shots year-round,
[01:45:42.068 --> 01:45:43.129]  And that's all civil, too.
[01:45:43.169 --> 01:45:44.050]  They claim you have to.
[01:45:44.090 --> 01:45:44.650]  You really don't.
[01:45:45.031 --> 01:45:45.951]  You can get waivers there.
[01:45:46.172 --> 01:45:47.593]  That's why you get sick every day.
[01:45:47.613 --> 01:45:48.954]  That's why you feel like crap.
[01:45:49.134 --> 01:45:50.755]  It's why you have migraine headaches.
[01:45:51.176 --> 01:45:52.737]  You've been pumped full of poison!
[01:45:53.458 --> 01:45:55.119]  And mercury's just the beginning, by the way.
[01:45:58.482 --> 01:46:01.384]  I mean, when are you going to start self-preservation?
[01:46:01.404 --> 01:46:02.646]  I'm going to stop yelling.
[01:46:02.846 --> 01:46:05.028]  I just get so... It makes me mad!
[01:46:06.088 --> 01:46:06.549]  I'm mad!
[01:46:10.484 --> 01:46:11.425]  I just, I'm frustrated.
[01:46:11.445 --> 01:46:12.366]  I want to warn people.
[01:46:12.406 --> 01:46:14.367]  I'm tired of these evil people getting away with this.
[01:46:14.848 --> 01:46:16.669]  I can't believe it just continues!
[01:46:18.130 --> 01:46:18.971]  And it gets worse and worse.
[01:46:19.031 --> 01:46:23.435]  I mean, again, 30 years ago it was 3 or 4 shots they tried to push on you.
[01:46:23.455 --> 01:46:25.316]  Then a decade ago it was only 10 or so.
[01:46:25.376 --> 01:46:27.778]  Now it's 45 plus shots.
[01:46:28.079 --> 01:46:28.879]  That's last year.
[01:46:28.919 --> 01:46:33.003]  Now they're trying to, quote, recommend a whole bunch more, depending on your state.
[01:46:33.923 --> 01:46:39.965]  And the recommendation, I mean we all hear, Rick Perry made a law, you gotta take the HPV shot for human papillomavirus.
[01:46:40.425 --> 01:46:45.627]  They admit it doesn't even protect you from it, and then it's a live virus and kills all these women and girls, but that's all kept real quiet.
[01:46:46.788 --> 01:46:50.929]  There's no law, he told the state health department, put it on a list of recommended.
[01:46:51.329 --> 01:46:56.151]  Then the media goes out, on the pharmaceutical bankroll, every other page is a drug ad.
[01:46:56.351 --> 01:46:58.532]  That's not just about the drug ad, it's about paying off the papers.
[01:46:59.232 --> 01:47:01.853]  When they say it's the law, you've got to take it!
[01:47:03.647 --> 01:47:04.768]  Then you go and take it.
[01:47:05.328 --> 01:47:10.091]  But by them mandating it, it gets... liability protection kicks in.
[01:47:10.331 --> 01:47:12.732]  For a drug they knew was killing women in the trials.
[01:47:13.012 --> 01:47:20.116]  So they know it's killing people, so they get it approved, and then try to force it so that it gets full liability protection.
[01:47:20.536 --> 01:47:21.777]  See how cold-blooded that is?
[01:47:22.217 --> 01:47:27.320]  I mean, Paul in his article, in case you're doubting any of this, put the Bayer story in here.
[01:47:30.071 --> 01:47:44.918]  Where they knowingly, from the mid-1980s until two years ago, in Australia, in the US, in Canada, in France... By the way, in France, I have to hand it to them, they arrested a bunch of executives there and charged them with murder.
[01:47:46.058 --> 01:47:47.539]  Yes, they're going to life in prison.
[01:47:48.391 --> 01:47:49.172]  Sentences like that.
[01:47:49.732 --> 01:47:50.152]  Nowhere else.
[01:47:50.192 --> 01:47:51.373]  It's just completely... Oh, that's funny.
[01:47:51.713 --> 01:47:55.856]  Certified documents in the lawsuits that they said, this has... all has AIDS in it.
[01:47:56.156 --> 01:47:57.277]  Just don't tell anybody.
[01:47:57.317 --> 01:47:59.098]  It'll give everybody AIDS, but just do it.
[01:47:59.479 --> 01:48:00.760]  And then everybody they gave AIDS to.
[01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:01.900]  In vaccines.
[01:48:02.501 --> 01:48:02.681]  Mm-hmm.
[01:48:03.541 --> 01:48:03.722]  Mm-hmm.
[01:48:03.862 --> 01:48:04.282]  Oh, yes.
[01:48:04.362 --> 01:48:05.063]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:48:06.043 --> 01:48:10.887]  And almost every vaccine out there, when it's been tested by independent labs, has cancer viruses in it.
[01:48:11.267 --> 01:48:12.428]  Hundreds and hundreds of reports.
[01:48:12.788 --> 01:48:15.770]  So what we're doing is we're creating a huge page that's going to get bigger and bigger.
[01:48:16.721 --> 01:48:19.203]  And it's going to start out with, here's the basic facts.
[01:48:20.965 --> 01:48:30.913]  Vaccines are dangerous, they're filled with all these different toxins, and there's no law you have to take them, so even if you believe they're good for you, why is the media and government lying and saying it's the law when it's not?
[01:48:31.193 --> 01:48:34.856]  You should start from that point and go, wait a minute, they're lying to me about that.
[01:48:36.778 --> 01:48:43.343]  And then move into, B, there is still mercury in them and they have increased it.
[01:48:44.064 --> 01:48:44.464]  And then C,
[01:48:46.753 --> 01:48:52.356]  In the Western world, the graph is, you lay them over each other, they're exactly the same, because it's the same globalist, same operation.
[01:48:54.097 --> 01:48:58.780]  Same social network, same governmental system, all run by the same social engineers.
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:01.782]  Australia, Canada, US, New Zealand, England.
[01:49:02.242 --> 01:49:04.163]  You lay the graphs over, they're almost identical.
[01:49:05.003 --> 01:49:10.146]  In the 20s, mass irrigation comes in, mass sanitation, no more sewers down the middle of the street.
[01:49:12.168 --> 01:49:14.589]  Communicable diseases plunge by over 90%.
[01:49:15.009 --> 01:49:16.410]  Then vaccines are introduced,
[01:49:17.713 --> 01:49:24.659]  It goes up a little, the diseases, the communicable diseases, and it happens to be the ones that the shots are involved with, they're actually just giving it to you.
[01:49:27.161 --> 01:49:37.889]  Evidence shows that earlier vaccines caused the polio epidemic, that's major reports by the way, and then you see heavy vaccination becomes popularized in the 60s, it goes back up!
[01:49:38.675 --> 01:49:44.297]  So we're going to have those graphs for you, and then we're going to get into the eugenics, why they're doing it to you.
[01:49:44.617 --> 01:49:51.759]  So there's one stop shop for free, so you can tell everybody where to go to learn.
[01:49:52.299 --> 01:49:57.581]  We'll get back, I'm going to get more into vaccines, and I'm going to beg you to do something.
[01:49:59.261 --> 01:50:00.682]  It is a big idea.
[01:50:01.742 --> 01:50:02.782]  A new world order.
[01:50:03.503 --> 01:50:07.744]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a power.
[01:50:08.402 --> 01:50:10.143]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[01:50:10.364 --> 01:50:13.486]  Wasn't their objective to be world domination?
[01:50:14.006 --> 01:50:16.428]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:24.514]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:27.532 --> 01:50:32.536]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:32.996 --> 01:50:36.478]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:36.859 --> 01:50:39.380]  Bill Burgess makes great progress in order world government.
[01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:40.561]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:40.581 --> 01:50:41.342]  They're not after money.
[01:50:41.362 --> 01:50:42.422]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:42.623 --> 01:50:43.403]  They're after power.
[01:50:43.623 --> 01:50:44.484]  That's what they're after, isn't it?

[01:53:13.223 --> 01:53:17.006]  And maybe I won't take calls.
[01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:31.307]  I'm going to plug some important things and then I'm going to get into the help I need from you.

[01:53:58.503 --> 01:54:01.224]  And then they can fall.
[01:54:01.244 --> 01:54:04.225]  And it's a long way they're going to be falling.
[01:54:06.926 --> 01:54:09.047]  We have to literally take the power.

[01:54:11.648 --> 01:54:16.069]  We have to literally get the moral authority and stand up and take action.
[01:54:16.510 --> 01:54:17.230]  It's called will!

[01:56:45.832 --> 01:56:50.816]  I mean, it's a no-brainer, folks.
[01:56:51.036 --> 01:56:55.019]  They can shut down the highways and shut off the food right now, and I've got a year's supply for my whole family.

[01:57:31.128 --> 01:57:33.689]  I'm begging you from my guts!
[01:57:34.170 --> 01:57:34.790]  And you know it!
[01:57:35.091 --> 01:57:36.191]  From my guts!

[01:57:54.893 --> 01:57:55.533]  Big Brother.
[01:57:56.194 --> 01:57:57.274]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:57.954 --> 01:57:59.095]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:59.715 --> 01:58:00.555]  You want answers?
[01:58:01.296 --> 01:58:02.216]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:02.856 --> 01:58:06.518]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:07.058 --> 01:58:11.160]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.401 --> 01:58:17.382]  Alright, I got a news blitz with all the news I haven't covered coming up.
[01:58:17.442 --> 01:58:18.463]  I promise I'll get to it.
[01:58:19.671 --> 01:58:25.121]  Right now I'm talking about an absolute key area in our defense against the New World Order.
[01:58:26.884 --> 01:58:31.011]  We're creating a section up on PrisonPlanet.com that is going to have examples
[01:58:32.086 --> 01:58:39.211]  Of chemical, biological testing, killing the American people, radiological testing, killing the American people, sterilization in other countries.
[01:58:39.711 --> 01:58:48.517]  Bertrand Russell, another top globalist who helped set up the CPS and the current system we're under, saying that they wanted to use mercury and vaccines to brain damage us.
[01:58:49.177 --> 01:58:55.661]  Explaining to people a section that in basic blurbs explains, but first, A, vaccines are really dangerous.
[01:58:55.941 --> 01:58:57.002]  Learn the full story here.
[01:58:58.977 --> 01:59:01.177]  B. You don't have to take the vaccines.
[01:59:01.197 --> 01:59:02.018]  There's no law.
[01:59:02.698 --> 01:59:04.618]  Why are they hoaxing and lying to you?
[01:59:05.378 --> 01:59:06.458]  Well, find out why.
[01:59:06.718 --> 01:59:07.599]  Here's the bigger story.
[01:59:07.639 --> 01:59:09.239]  It's part of a giant eugenics program.
[01:59:09.859 --> 01:59:12.600]  C. They haven't taken the mercury out, and that's only part of it.
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:14.140]  The cancer viruses.
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:18.701]  It only starts with the SB40, which they admit has caused tens of millions of cancers worldwide.
[01:59:19.621 --> 01:59:20.841]  And it's communicable, by the way.
[01:59:21.901 --> 01:59:24.502]  It's in 100% of the sewage systems in India.
[01:59:24.582 --> 01:59:25.562]  It's all over the US.
[01:59:26.904 --> 01:59:27.985]  I mean, there's hundreds of points.
[01:59:28.005 --> 01:59:29.245]  We're going to be adding more and more.
[01:59:29.846 --> 01:59:32.287]  So, hey, these things are filled with dangerous stuff.
[01:59:32.307 --> 01:59:38.950]  Here's all the plants that have been shut down, people that have been caught, the tetanus shots where they caught them, binding the female hormone to it to sterilize women.
[01:59:39.650 --> 01:59:42.752]  Here's the sperm count down by over 80% in the Western world.
[01:59:43.072 --> 01:59:45.493]  Here's women's fertility way down, even young women.
[01:59:46.213 --> 01:59:47.854]  Document all that, and then here's why.
[01:59:47.914 --> 01:59:48.735]  Here's the eugenics.
[01:59:48.755 --> 01:59:49.895]  They believe we're a virus.
[01:59:50.235 --> 01:59:50.956]  Humans are evil.
[01:59:50.996 --> 01:59:51.876]  They want to get rid of us.
[01:59:51.896 --> 01:59:53.577]  The elite are orchestrating all of this.
[01:59:57.114 --> 02:00:10.724]  And show people what's really happening, and we're going to have a whole video section on there with all these doctors and medical doctors and scientists and Nobel Prize winners admitting that it is a cocktail of things.
[02:00:10.804 --> 02:00:14.546]  Listen, boys tend, it's one reason of hundreds, but this is the big one.
[02:00:14.966 --> 02:00:22.812]  Boys have a gene missing, more often than girls, thousands of times more often, very rare in girls, that allows more absorption of mercury.
[02:00:23.695 --> 02:00:29.337]  And so a boy who lived by a seashore naturally and ate fish his whole life, but it would be later in life, it would build up later.
[02:00:29.957 --> 02:00:31.538]  A baby's supposed to drink milk for six months.
[02:00:31.598 --> 02:00:32.918]  It's been figured out before.
[02:00:33.238 --> 02:00:36.419]  And then the mammary glands filter all that stuff out.
[02:00:36.439 --> 02:00:41.401]  But that's why women, by the way, don't get it as much because their bodies are designed more for filtering.
[02:00:42.081 --> 02:00:43.882]  Boy, somebody had it all figured out, didn't they?
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:53.923]  It builds up, and yeah, you'll end up getting a crazy person, and you get more crazy people in those seaside communities in Italy and Japan and other places, and they're mainly male.
[02:00:54.983 --> 02:00:56.124]  From mercury poisoning.
[02:00:56.564 --> 02:00:57.984]  Mercury madness, as it was called.
[02:00:58.324 --> 02:01:03.106]  Mercury is one of the most studied things in even ancient history because it was involved in so many problems.
[02:01:05.047 --> 02:01:08.948]  So, they shoot these boys up with 40 plus injections.
[02:01:10.449 --> 02:01:11.869]  By the time they're 18 months old.
[02:01:14.330 --> 02:01:14.470]  And,
[02:01:16.383 --> 02:01:21.308]  They don't have the gene activated that blocks the mercury and it goes right into the brain.
[02:01:21.408 --> 02:01:22.248]  It's real simple.
[02:01:22.969 --> 02:01:30.396]  Now you add to that the cocktail of cancer viruses and all the other toxins and DNA fragments and the autoimmune diseases they're causing.
[02:01:30.616 --> 02:01:32.438]  You look at the HPV shot with women.
[02:01:33.198 --> 02:01:34.760]  I mean, it's now
[02:01:35.896 --> 02:01:39.558]  Getting close to a hundred women that have died, and that's just what's being reported.
[02:01:39.878 --> 02:01:46.082]  You know, six months ago, when we first started reporting on it, it had only been out for a few months, and it was, what, four people died and hundreds had autoimmune?
[02:01:46.122 --> 02:01:51.405]  I mean, I mean, swelling up, blood pouring out your eyes, you're high and in, out of your fingernails, like Ebola.
[02:01:52.965 --> 02:01:56.307]  I mean, they shoot you up with that live cancer virus, folks, and it's meltdown time.
[02:01:56.567 --> 02:01:58.689]  And boy, you watch these women over their lives.
[02:02:00.389 --> 02:02:01.510]  I mean, heaven knows.
[02:02:01.970 --> 02:02:03.131]  Here's the big point.
[02:02:04.085 --> 02:02:05.346]  That's what you need to explain to people.
[02:02:05.746 --> 02:02:06.787]  Do you know about eugenics?
[02:02:06.807 --> 02:02:08.028]  And they'll go, no, what's that?
[02:02:08.068 --> 02:02:17.235]  Well, remember Hitler started killing the retarded folks and then moving on to people that were blind, and then it was hygiene to kill, you know, the Jews and other people?
[02:02:17.656 --> 02:02:18.717]  Oh yeah, I know about that.
[02:02:18.737 --> 02:02:20.438]  Well, did you know he learned about that in the U.S.?
[02:02:21.839 --> 02:02:33.088]  And then you go, okay, well, the same people run things now, and they've been caught doing it all these other times to us, so why would you trust them now to give you shots?
[02:02:36.198 --> 02:02:45.048]  And then you take them to PrisonPlanet.com in this new section and you go, see here, AP, Reuters, BBC, knowingly AIDS virus in the vaccine.
[02:02:46.009 --> 02:02:46.930]  Show them this!
[02:02:47.130 --> 02:02:47.911]  This is admitted!
[02:02:52.339 --> 02:03:03.613]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[02:03:03.813 --> 02:03:10.281]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[02:03:10.521 --> 02:03:11.162]  We're good to go!

[02:03:40.827 --> 02:03:41.608]  It is a big idea.
[02:03:41.628 --> 02:03:42.208]  A new world order.
[02:03:42.228 --> 02:03:45.290]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by our government.
[02:03:59.910 --> 02:04:01.671]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[02:04:02.732 --> 02:04:04.874]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:04:05.514 --> 02:04:07.956]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:04:08.696 --> 02:04:16.062]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:04:19.045 --> 02:04:24.028]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:04:24.489 --> 02:04:27.991]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:04:28.351 --> 02:04:30.873]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:04:30.933 --> 02:04:32.094]  Most people have no idea.
[02:04:32.114 --> 02:04:32.814]  They're not after money.
[02:04:32.834 --> 02:04:33.935]  They have all the money they need.
[02:04:34.115 --> 02:04:34.936]  They're after power.
[02:04:35.136 --> 02:04:35.936]  That's what happens here.

[02:04:58.189 --> 02:05:01.330]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[02:05:46.538 --> 02:05:48.299]  Working with the power of nature.
[02:05:50.239 --> 02:05:52.900]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:53.401 --> 02:05:56.282]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.882 --> 02:06:01.424]  Think about the magnitude of it.
[02:06:04.481 --> 02:06:31.988]  Bayer, knowingly, in the U.S., Canada, England, France, Germany, Russia, worldwide, knowingly from the mid-eighties right through until two years ago, and now in court, the head of Bayer admitted it, the head of the division admitted it, they knowingly knew that all of their blood product injections, serums, but it's an injectable monthly vaccine is how they describe it,
[02:06:33.248 --> 02:06:34.108]  I don't know why they call it that.
[02:06:34.128 --> 02:06:35.008]  It's not really a vaccine.
[02:06:35.028 --> 02:06:36.469]  It's one of these drugs they inject you with.
[02:06:37.889 --> 02:06:39.389]  Had AIDS virus in it.
[02:06:40.009 --> 02:06:42.150]  And was giving everyone who got it AIDS.
[02:06:45.931 --> 02:06:46.491]  And they knew.
[02:06:47.411 --> 02:06:49.231]  It's a loving thing they do.
[02:06:49.291 --> 02:06:50.812]  It's their religion to them.
[02:06:50.872 --> 02:06:52.752]  It's, oh, death unto thee.
[02:06:53.112 --> 02:06:53.552]  You understand?
[02:06:53.572 --> 02:06:54.652]  These are sickos.
[02:06:55.093 --> 02:06:57.693]  Do you understand Dr. Eric Bianca from UT?
[02:06:58.793 --> 02:07:01.814]  They're one of the head guys in their biology department.
[02:07:02.575 --> 02:07:16.648]  Went and was given a reward last year, the Texas Academy of Sciences First Place Award, and there was thousands of people in attendance, and the paper reported that 95% stood in repeated standing ovations.
[02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:24.875]  As he said, we need a police state like China so we can enforce one-child policies, we need the dying to start soon, we need 90% to die.
[02:07:27.976 --> 02:07:30.397]  Then his graduate students sent me threatening emails.
[02:07:30.637 --> 02:07:39.599]  Then I went and found their papers on their own blogs, their master's thesis, their PhDs, about how we all need to die.
[02:07:40.099 --> 02:07:43.920]  And then you start looking at the heads of biology departments from Princeton with Dr. Peter Singer.
[02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:45.341]  He's even worse.
[02:07:46.101 --> 02:07:48.722]  He calls our children mackerel.
[02:07:49.442 --> 02:07:53.683]  He says a baby human has the same value as a mackerel fish.
[02:07:56.912 --> 02:08:05.034]  But I tell Bianca, and I tell Singer and all of you, and Prince Philip, and Ted Turner, and every single one of you, and Schwarzenegger who's big in this.
[02:08:06.014 --> 02:08:08.355]  I'll tell you, Prince Philip, I'll tell you all something right now.
[02:08:08.375 --> 02:08:11.696]  Prince Charles, you go first.
[02:08:11.796 --> 02:08:13.376]  You get out of my way.
[02:08:14.777 --> 02:08:16.637]  You stop killing innocent people.
[02:08:16.697 --> 02:08:17.998]  You stop doing things.
[02:08:18.658 --> 02:08:23.199]  And by the way, this very crowd that's running all of this, this very crowd who's behind all of this,
[02:08:24.432 --> 02:08:30.794]  Every time you turn around, they are funding and financing things that literally endanger the planet.
[02:08:31.134 --> 02:08:39.857]  I mean, folks, volcanoes exploding, high-power radiation from space, comets slamming into the Earth.
[02:08:39.937 --> 02:08:40.977]  We've been through it all.
[02:08:42.278 --> 02:08:53.221]  Again, we are a huge spaceship with a living skin on it, with molten rock, with huge tectonic islands floating on molten lakes.
[02:08:54.503 --> 02:08:59.526]  Hurtling around at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour around the sun.
[02:09:01.447 --> 02:09:02.247]  See, look around you.
[02:09:02.267 --> 02:09:07.510]  Realize the wonderment of what you're in, what you're witnessing, what you're seeing.
[02:09:12.212 --> 02:09:17.575]  And realize that carbon coming out of your tailpipe isn't going to hurt the earth.
[02:09:21.258 --> 02:09:24.521]  Realize that you having more babies isn't going to hurt the Earth.
[02:09:26.123 --> 02:09:41.438]  What's going to hurt the Earth is thousands of labs, open air, breeding cross-species chimeras that has already gotten into the global genome of the planet and is spreading like a cancer.
[02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:46.613]  And all the big studies just don't show the mercury is causing the brain damage.
[02:09:46.673 --> 02:09:55.341]  It's a cocktail of auto-immuno responses because of the genetic engineered foods!
[02:10:02.687 --> 02:10:03.909]  And so the people respond.
[02:10:03.929 --> 02:10:07.252]  The last 10 years, 10 years ago, you couldn't even hardly get organic food in Austin.
[02:10:08.172 --> 02:10:09.974]  Now every chain store has it.
[02:10:14.051 --> 02:10:17.372]  The country started demanding it, and what did they do last year?
[02:10:17.412 --> 02:10:22.173]  They got a law passed where it can be 75% non-organic and they certify it as organic.
[02:10:22.213 --> 02:10:25.094]  See, they don't want you to even be able to know.
[02:10:26.995 --> 02:10:29.296]  They do all of this by design.
[02:10:31.641 --> 02:10:37.924]  Do you realize that the global elite are very intelligent, they're into science, they're into creativity, but in a dark way.
[02:10:38.285 --> 02:10:44.068]  They revel in being aggressive and hyper-dominant and so competitive you can't even imagine.
[02:10:46.309 --> 02:10:50.551]  And it's the ultimate selfishness to kill and exterminate masses of people.
[02:10:50.631 --> 02:10:59.956]  It is the ultimate selfishness to say, I want myself and mine to be dominant into the future,
[02:11:00.936 --> 02:11:13.394]  And so we're going to poison and dumb down the mass of people and stir up wars and proliferate weapons and then claim we need global government to counter the proliferation of the weapons and do all these evil things and just race!
[02:11:14.976 --> 02:11:16.939]  And there's hundreds of examples, but...
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:22.262]  They're doing nothing to stop the chopping down of the rainforest.
[02:11:22.423 --> 02:11:24.705]  I don't think that's good, and it's certainly not good for the Earth.
[02:11:25.946 --> 02:11:29.349]  Overall, though, it's nothing compared to meteorites slamming in and the stuff that happened in the past.
[02:11:29.389 --> 02:11:30.670]  But, I mean, you could say, yeah, that's bad.
[02:11:32.431 --> 02:11:34.633]  Only because of the treasures of biodiversity there.
[02:11:35.294 --> 02:11:41.199]  But then you find out the big groups pushing that really are like the NRA to gun control.
[02:11:41.519 --> 02:11:42.420]  The fathers of it.
[02:11:42.825 --> 02:11:44.726]  And then they pose as being pro-gun.
[02:11:45.086 --> 02:11:51.068]  And then they position and control the indigenous groups, and then put them on reservations, and then they act as the advocates.
[02:11:51.248 --> 02:11:54.269]  And you find out the big groups protecting the rainforest really aren't.
[02:11:54.509 --> 02:11:57.730]  They're all financed by big oil companies and are involved in destroying it.
[02:11:59.210 --> 02:12:01.531]  That's what's so amazing when you find out the truth.
[02:12:01.551 --> 02:12:08.053]  I mean, you find out that the Delaware River, the Colorado River, the Gulf of Mexico,
[02:12:09.051 --> 02:12:10.672]  The Pacific, the Atlantic.
[02:12:11.112 --> 02:12:17.437]  I mean, every month the Army just hauls huge barges out with Sarin, VX, Nerve Gas, Mustard Gas.
[02:12:17.477 --> 02:12:19.198]  They just dump it right into the ocean.
[02:12:19.898 --> 02:12:32.367]  And trawlers come by with their nets on the bottom fishing and they're just scooping it up and you're just eating it.
[02:12:34.888 --> 02:12:37.050]  I mean, it's an insane disconnect.
[02:12:37.130 --> 02:12:38.651]  It's like we're demonic now.
[02:12:40.478 --> 02:12:41.399]  And that's just one example.
[02:12:42.239 --> 02:12:43.020]  I mean, there's hundreds.
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:43.700]  It just goes on.
[02:12:44.001 --> 02:12:46.462]  I mean, the Russians will just throw nuclear reactors in lakes.
[02:12:51.826 --> 02:12:55.309]  It's like that CNBC piece where they go, well, let's keep letting the toys.
[02:12:55.349 --> 02:12:55.749]  It's good.
[02:12:55.789 --> 02:12:56.850]  Poison food's good.
[02:12:57.651 --> 02:12:58.791]  Mercury's good for you.
[02:12:59.992 --> 02:13:00.633]  I'm not going to play it again.
[02:13:00.653 --> 02:13:01.453]  I've played it too many times.
[02:13:01.594 --> 02:13:02.955]  For new listeners, if you don't believe it, fine.
[02:13:04.336 --> 02:13:04.656]  It's true.
[02:13:04.676 --> 02:13:05.176]  I have the clips.
[02:13:06.657 --> 02:13:08.859]  This is the type of stuff that we're facing.
[02:13:10.586 --> 02:13:18.432]  So I'm not... Again, they're killing people and poisoning us and doing all this, saying it's for the Earth, but meanwhile, they're the ones destroying the Earth!
[02:13:18.832 --> 02:13:23.055]  It's... They can only be described as Hell's Legion.
[02:13:25.997 --> 02:13:35.523]  I mean, literally, no Stephen King book, no Nightmare Dream at 3am, nothing can describe an actual intellectual analysis of the New World Order.
[02:13:35.584 --> 02:13:37.305]  They are Hell.
[02:13:38.439 --> 02:13:39.620]  They are death.
[02:13:39.701 --> 02:13:42.384]  They are the smell of rotten meat.
[02:13:42.404 --> 02:13:44.686]  That's the only way to describe evil.
[02:13:44.987 --> 02:13:45.527]  It's weak.
[02:13:45.627 --> 02:13:48.290]  It's a pile of rotting flesh and maggots.
[02:13:49.372 --> 02:13:53.216]  The best way to describe the New World Order is a pile of dead children with maggots eating them.
[02:13:54.426 --> 02:13:55.207]  That's your power.
[02:13:55.247 --> 02:13:55.987]  That's your cup.
[02:13:56.047 --> 02:13:57.128]  That's what you're reaching for.
[02:13:57.408 --> 02:13:58.529]  That's what it is.
[02:13:58.949 --> 02:14:00.750]  It's kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:14:00.890 --> 02:14:02.111]  Death, death, death.
[02:14:02.571 --> 02:14:03.232]  And I see it.
[02:14:03.492 --> 02:14:04.893]  I see it clearly what it is.
[02:14:05.213 --> 02:14:06.694]  It is so... I do marvel.
[02:14:06.934 --> 02:14:08.435]  Oh yes, I marvel at the beast.
[02:14:08.976 --> 02:14:10.116]  It is unbelievable.
[02:14:10.837 --> 02:14:12.238]  And my mouth is hanging open.
[02:14:12.538 --> 02:14:13.879]  And then you have a public
[02:14:14.719 --> 02:14:21.561]  Who first feel inadequate, they first make you feel inadequate and petty and Madison Avenue makes you feel like you're ugly and don't have enough baubles or junk.
[02:14:21.621 --> 02:14:37.866]  And I found out sociologists in the 20s and 30s wrote about how they would create this new system of production, use baubles to control you, little trinkets you'd work hard for to get new signets of being middle class when you really weren't middle class.
[02:14:38.996 --> 02:14:49.079]  You know, the education and enlightenment and understanding and involvement that comes with that, and how they would create stratified societies, how the elite would break off and create a new species, how they would then exterminate us.
[02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:51.840]  You've got to handle the New World Order, folks.
[02:14:51.860 --> 02:14:56.082]  They're actually following that model, and they believe that's what they're doing.
[02:14:56.402 --> 02:14:59.323]  You can say, well, who knows if they'll really get super life extension?
[02:14:59.543 --> 02:15:00.723]  Who knows if they already have it?
[02:15:01.143 --> 02:15:03.304]  Who knows if they'll carry their plan out completely?
[02:15:03.584 --> 02:15:08.566]  All I know is it's their plan, and they keep carrying it out, and they keep doing everything they said they'd do.
[02:15:09.631 --> 02:15:11.352]  And I'm going, Mike, I keep hoping.
[02:15:11.612 --> 02:15:13.553]  Well, they won't really implode the dollar.
[02:15:13.573 --> 02:15:14.813]  They'll hold back at that point.
[02:15:14.933 --> 02:15:15.533]  Nope, they didn't.
[02:15:16.354 --> 02:15:17.474]  The public isn't even aware of it.
[02:15:17.974 --> 02:15:20.355]  Okay, they're not going to keep overrunning us with illegals.
[02:15:20.415 --> 02:15:21.135]  Somebody will.
[02:15:21.155 --> 02:15:22.216]  This is too evil.
[02:15:22.856 --> 02:15:23.476]  They'll back off.
[02:15:23.496 --> 02:15:24.137]  They'll slow down.
[02:15:24.217 --> 02:15:24.777]  Nope, they don't.
[02:15:26.077 --> 02:15:28.318]  Oh, we'll wake up to the gun control and back them off.
[02:15:28.338 --> 02:15:30.299]  Well, people wake up and don't want it, but they still do it.
[02:15:30.359 --> 02:15:32.080]  See, that's the thing.
[02:15:32.180 --> 02:15:33.860]  This is all playtime right now.
[02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:35.421]  This is all happy days.
[02:15:35.481 --> 02:15:36.681]  Calm before the storm.
[02:15:36.941 --> 02:15:38.202]  This is all Shangri-La.
[02:15:39.542 --> 02:15:40.202]  Valhalla!
[02:15:43.844 --> 02:15:44.964]  Chicka Chicka Woo Woo!
[02:15:44.984 --> 02:15:46.364]  I mean this is all happy!
[02:15:47.245 --> 02:15:48.305]  Green Pastures, folks!
[02:15:49.565 --> 02:15:50.826]  You think this is bad right now?
[02:15:50.886 --> 02:15:51.926]  This is prelude!
[02:15:52.186 --> 02:15:54.527]  The Vanguard hasn't even slammed into you yet!
[02:15:55.788 --> 02:15:59.649]  And I want you, when it hits, when it slams in, as things get more and more insane,
[02:16:00.772 --> 02:16:03.216]  I want you to know, look, they're already drugging us with the water and the air.
[02:16:03.256 --> 02:16:05.640]  They're already using different waves against us.
[02:16:05.660 --> 02:16:06.621]  That's mainstream news.
[02:16:06.861 --> 02:16:09.285]  They're already poisoning us in the vaccines and the food.
[02:16:09.505 --> 02:16:15.474]  And I'm just saying it's going to get worse and worse as they titrate the dose, as they build it up and use it against us, as they test it.
[02:16:15.715 --> 02:16:16.476]  I mean, it's admitted.
[02:16:17.359 --> 02:16:19.040]  I've read reports on it, but not the details.
[02:16:19.060 --> 02:16:21.200]  Then I talked to a top computer programmer I've known for years.
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:31.564]  Then he realized what he was agreeing to and chickened out about how he's over in, you know, Singapore and how they have different sectors of Singapore in the main city where they test different drugs on people who go through the water.
[02:16:32.444 --> 02:16:34.265]  But then he realized what he was telling me and he wouldn't come.
[02:16:34.305 --> 02:16:35.205]  I mean, I already know that.
[02:16:35.665 --> 02:16:36.426]  I mean, that's what I mean.
[02:16:36.506 --> 02:16:40.087]  We are in red-level emergency.
[02:16:40.876 --> 02:16:44.697]  They've already radiated hundreds of thousands of children on purpose killing many of them.
[02:16:44.917 --> 02:16:46.658]  They've already put poison in your food.
[02:16:46.878 --> 02:16:48.478]  They've already put poison in your water.
[02:16:48.658 --> 02:16:51.239]  They've already done it all 10,000 times 10,000.
[02:16:51.479 --> 02:16:54.620]  They are doing it all right now, much worse than they ever were.
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:56.580]  It's all going on right now.
[02:16:57.460 --> 02:17:03.182]  And we are such dynamic, incredible creatures that we are withstanding a lot of it.
[02:17:03.302 --> 02:17:04.762]  Some people are making through it.
[02:17:04.802 --> 02:17:07.223]  Some people are somewhat immune to it or resistant.
[02:17:10.493 --> 02:17:14.414]  I just, there's such an incredible thing going on, and it's not my opinion.
[02:17:14.634 --> 02:17:17.774]  To FBI, and police, and military listening, and all that guy's a nut.
[02:17:18.094 --> 02:17:18.814]  No, I'm not!
[02:17:18.914 --> 02:17:21.375]  It's documents, it's government documents!
[02:17:22.095 --> 02:17:24.715]  I mean, that's what I'm telling you, they're hurting you too!
[02:17:25.836 --> 02:17:31.297]  It's ridiculous that you even fight against us, and you believe that your masters lies about us!
[02:17:31.797 --> 02:17:33.357]  You're under mind control!
[02:17:34.797 --> 02:17:36.698]  They've implanted you with the viruses!
[02:17:37.538 --> 02:17:38.938]  They're putting it in your water!
[02:17:39.838 --> 02:17:41.883]  You're with us whether you like it or not!
[02:17:42.565 --> 02:17:43.848]  That's what's so ridiculous!
[02:17:51.187 --> 02:17:54.749]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:17:54.809 --> 02:17:55.309]  are located?
[02:17:55.509 --> 02:17:58.891]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:17:59.131 --> 02:18:03.834]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:18:04.114 --> 02:18:11.058]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas, brewing environmental catastrophes,
[02:18:11.198 --> 02:18:11.578]  I think so.
[02:18:28.985 --> 02:18:29.365]  I think so.
[02:18:50.535 --> 02:18:55.843]  Ted Edders of Hermidas October 18, 2007 Gold 764 20 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $787.64, $388.30 per half and $194.15 per quarter.
[02:18:55.863 --> 02:18:56.203]  That's $787.64, $388.30 and $194.15.
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:07.860]  Hedge funds caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[02:19:07.900 --> 02:19:09.681]  The bond market continues to slump.
[02:19:09.861 --> 02:19:10.181]  J.P.
[02:19:10.221 --> 02:19:13.181]  Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[02:19:13.221 --> 02:19:15.442]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[02:19:15.502 --> 02:19:20.383]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[02:19:20.443 --> 02:19:22.883]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[02:19:23.003 --> 02:19:27.424]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders is skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[02:19:27.764 --> 02:19:28.164]  The U.S.
[02:19:28.204 --> 02:19:32.565]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[02:19:32.665 --> 02:19:34.445]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[02:19:34.885 --> 02:19:37.669]  Economist Rody Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[02:19:37.929 --> 02:19:39.131]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[02:19:39.251 --> 02:19:44.838]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[02:19:44.918 --> 02:19:45.159]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.179 --> 02:19:45.359]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:51.182 --> 02:19:54.184]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:54.464 --> 02:20:03.488]  Did you know that the Lenin School of Political Warfare has laid down a plan for a third world war that will destroy both Christianity and Communism at the same time?
[02:20:04.208 --> 02:20:09.711]  From the rubbles of this war, the Illuminati will establish their world government, prophesied in Revelation chapter 13.
[02:20:11.155 --> 02:20:21.155]  Communism said they would pretend to collapse, and when America had begun to disarm, the combined communist world would launch a surprise attack and smash us with their clenched fists.
[02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:29.122]  We'd like to show you how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:29.823 --> 02:20:31.263]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.

[02:20:32.444 --> 02:20:33.124]  Call now.
[02:20:33.144 --> 02:20:35.685]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:49.116 --> 02:20:51.238]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[02:20:51.599 --> 02:20:54.682]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[02:20:54.922 --> 02:20:59.507]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[02:20:59.868 --> 02:21:02.490]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[02:21:02.991 --> 02:21:09.718]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[02:21:10.158 --> 02:21:15.382]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[02:21:15.842 --> 02:21:17.483]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[02:21:18.003 --> 02:21:21.286]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[02:21:21.866 --> 02:21:25.208]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[02:21:25.248 --> 02:21:32.233]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[02:21:32.593 --> 02:21:37.957]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and shipping.
[02:21:38.297 --> 02:21:41.199]  Share the oil company secret and get SFR now!
[02:21:41.459 --> 02:21:41.979]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:21:42.099 --> 02:21:42.880]  That's 888-873-7371 today!
[02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:43.480]  Here's the deal!
[02:22:02.292 --> 02:22:13.778]  If we don't turn this around, our future becomes more and more nightmarish as the globalists create order out of chaos and global calamity.
[02:22:15.979 --> 02:22:17.900]  The claims I've made are documented.
[02:22:18.997 --> 02:22:19.698]  Intraplicate.
[02:22:19.718 --> 02:22:21.401]  They are available for anyone that wants to know.
[02:22:21.421 --> 02:22:24.585]  We're building a eugenics section starting with vaccines.
[02:22:24.945 --> 02:22:26.427]  We're going to build other subsections.
[02:22:26.468 --> 02:22:32.676]  We've written scores of articles and made hundreds of pages of info, but we're putting it all in one place at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:22:33.537 --> 02:22:33.878]  Paul?
[02:22:34.582 --> 02:22:40.544]  In the next few hours is up on PrisonPlanet.com is launching the basic page with here are the waivers.
[02:22:40.604 --> 02:22:42.124]  It's no law to take the vaccines.
[02:22:42.384 --> 02:22:43.985]  They still have mercury in them.
[02:22:44.445 --> 02:22:46.125]  This is the problems it causes.
[02:22:46.225 --> 02:22:47.286]  It's by design.
[02:22:47.326 --> 02:22:48.406]  They've done it before.
[02:22:48.806 --> 02:22:51.067]  You know, so you can send somebody to one place.
[02:22:51.347 --> 02:22:51.967]  I've been looking!
[02:22:51.987 --> 02:23:00.529]  You know, there's places that'll, with doctors, it'll show that it's the mercury and they'll show it under an electron microscope and there's places it'll show there's no law to have to take it.
[02:23:00.569 --> 02:23:03.190]  There's places it'll show, you know, why they're doing it.
[02:23:04.525 --> 02:23:07.886]  Well, there's places that will show that since they introduced vaccines, there was more diseases.
[02:23:08.186 --> 02:23:14.868]  We ought to add in there about that they give them the polio shot, or the oral, and they all get it and die or become paralyzed.
[02:23:15.108 --> 02:23:15.788]  That just happened.
[02:23:15.808 --> 02:23:17.528]  I mean, there's hundreds and hundreds of these stories.
[02:23:18.969 --> 02:23:24.750]  And I know Tim here in the office found hundreds of them a few weeks ago, and I had this idea, well, had it again, to build all this.
[02:23:25.450 --> 02:23:27.251]  Don't forget, Tim, to send all that to Paul again.
[02:23:27.271 --> 02:23:27.911]  They're listeners.
[02:23:29.012 --> 02:23:31.033]  Send the stuff to Tim at InfoWars.com.
[02:23:31.053 --> 02:23:36.015]  Go over to Prison Planet and click on email the webmaster and email Paul all the mainline stuff.
[02:23:36.035 --> 02:23:43.577]  See, it's all out there, HAR after HAR, knowingly putting AIDS virus in vaccines, knowingly putting cancer virus, knowingly.
[02:23:44.158 --> 02:23:48.539]  And I'll talk to medical doctors and they'll go, I wasn't aware of that, and I'll hand them mainline articles and they'll go, oh my gosh!
[02:23:49.199 --> 02:23:53.341]  See, it's all just right in plain view, but a little piece here, a little piece there.
[02:23:54.036 --> 02:23:57.799]  See, they'll make Britney Spears being drunk some big national thing.
[02:23:57.819 --> 02:24:00.802]  Everybody knows what dress she was wearing or what she wasn't wearing.
[02:24:01.643 --> 02:24:07.268]  But then in the back of the newswire, back of the paper, there'll be this incredible announcement, but they'll say it like it's no big deal.
[02:24:09.089 --> 02:24:12.252]  Well, see, I'm looking at what's admitted and going, that is a huge deal!
[02:24:14.224 --> 02:24:23.372]  I mean we've gone from, and I keep saying 1 in 2,000, actual numbers, I've been doing more research, was before 20 years ago it was 1 in 3,000.
[02:24:23.913 --> 02:24:28.237]  And before 50 years ago it was less than 1 in a million.
[02:24:28.377 --> 02:24:29.558]  Autism was unknown.
[02:24:31.159 --> 02:24:34.522]  So now I've gone and actually got numbers back past 1980.
[02:24:34.602 --> 02:24:37.385]  I can't believe what I've found.
[02:24:40.169 --> 02:24:41.790]  It's now 1 in 75.
[02:24:41.850 --> 02:24:44.091]  It was 168 two years ago.
[02:24:44.491 --> 02:24:49.414]  Now it's 1 in 75, but I think that's under-reported, actually, because I'm seeing it everywhere.
[02:24:49.474 --> 02:24:50.995]  I mean, these little boys are gone.
[02:24:52.142 --> 02:24:55.946]  And all the women at the hair place know all these children.
[02:24:56.247 --> 02:24:58.849]  Every boy they know in some circles has it.
[02:24:59.530 --> 02:25:03.014]  I go to see a movie and then there's 30, 40 autistic kids there.
[02:25:03.354 --> 02:25:06.137]  I mean, it's just like, it's unbelievable!
[02:25:06.197 --> 02:25:07.459]  We're under attack!
[02:25:07.799 --> 02:25:08.640]  They know it!
[02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:10.903]  They said in the 20s they would do it!
[02:25:12.791 --> 02:25:15.733]  And then I have liberal friends go, how dare you talk bad about Bertrand Russell?
[02:25:15.753 --> 02:25:16.453]  He wasn't racist.
[02:25:16.473 --> 02:25:21.116]  And I go, okay, here's a book he wrote calling black people gross and saying we should get rid of them.
[02:25:21.336 --> 02:25:23.238]  Oh gosh, wow, I didn't know he said that.
[02:25:23.658 --> 02:25:25.839]  Yeah, you know, Time Magazine Man of the Year.
[02:25:26.420 --> 02:25:28.121]  Time's most 100 interesting people.
[02:25:28.341 --> 02:25:29.682]  Half of them are eugenicists.
[02:25:29.942 --> 02:25:31.443]  I mean, here's the father of DNA.
[02:25:33.018 --> 02:25:51.566]  James Watson's still alive, he ran the Coal Springs Eugenics Laboratory, they changed the name to the Human Genome Project in 1945, they gave Hitler all his data, and he ran it till 95, and he's out here saying blacks are stupid, but that's not the big story, that's bad enough.
[02:25:51.806 --> 02:26:01.731]  He goes into saying, you know, one-child policies, in a newspaper interview, a bunch he's been giving lately, you gotta go read Jim Ford to get all the horrible quotes, there's a bunch of them in here,
[02:26:02.603 --> 02:26:11.029]  He says, yeah, we should restrict people from having children who are dumb, we should make all the girls pretty, we should take control with government power.
[02:26:11.449 --> 02:26:13.831]  What do you think the Human Genome Project's about?
[02:26:13.991 --> 02:26:26.999]  When you hear about National Geographic, Total Intelligence Op, from the beginning, back to the CIA and OSS using their field people as doubles, like they use missionaries as well, I'm already digressing.
[02:26:27.540 --> 02:26:29.581]  It's just, there's so much data I want to give you.
[02:26:30.242 --> 02:26:34.367]  They've got this international program, oh find your roots and come give your blood.
[02:26:34.687 --> 02:26:38.771]  We'll find out where you really come from in association with the Human Genome Project.
[02:26:39.112 --> 02:26:43.036]  And they've been taking blood from everyone 34 and younger from New Zealand to the U.S.
[02:26:43.256 --> 02:26:49.143]  in an international secret program, now declassified, taking your blood at birth and putting it in federal databases.
[02:26:49.503 --> 02:26:50.984]  What do you think they're doing with that?
[02:26:51.144 --> 02:26:52.184]  They can use it to frame you?
[02:26:52.344 --> 02:26:56.106]  They can use it to make race-specific special bioweapons just for you?
[02:26:56.486 --> 02:27:04.290]  They're now building factories that we've looked at the specs of that are perfect to actually build bioweapons for individuals to kill just one person?
[02:27:05.890 --> 02:27:09.632]  Oh yes, it's so evil and diabolical.
[02:27:13.138 --> 02:27:27.488]  Dick Cheney in the PNAC document, September 2000, Revolving American Defenses, September 20th, he comes out and he says, we need to legitimize the use of race-specific bio-weapons in the media to be a politically useful tool, openly calling for the use of race bio-weapons.
[02:27:27.868 --> 02:27:28.529]  Red alert!
[02:27:28.829 --> 02:27:29.430]  Red alert!
[02:27:29.450 --> 02:27:30.670]  I mean, what am I supposed to do?
[02:27:30.690 --> 02:27:35.854]  A normal response is just to start screaming and yelling and running down the street, waving your arms.
[02:27:36.074 --> 02:27:39.817]  But we've been bathed in this so long, we just accept it.
[02:27:41.070 --> 02:27:44.073]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:44.994 --> 02:27:47.697]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:28:37.271 --> 02:28:39.873]  That's D-R-Y-I-N-G-123.com or call 1-800-875-4254.
[02:28:39.913 --> 02:28:40.233]  That's 1-800-875-4254.
[02:28:50.759 --> 02:28:51.379]  It's a fact.
[02:28:51.579 --> 02:28:58.661]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:28:58.701 --> 02:29:05.623]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making
[02:29:05.663 --> 02:29:06.083]  We're good to go.
[02:29:33.592 --> 02:29:34.213]  I think so.
[02:29:49.228 --> 02:29:49.768]  Hey, Emily!
[02:29:50.048 --> 02:29:50.909]  Wow, you look great!
[02:29:51.129 --> 02:29:51.949]  I feel great!
[02:29:52.189 --> 02:29:53.969]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[02:29:54.249 --> 02:29:54.570]  Really?
[02:29:54.770 --> 02:29:55.190]  What is it?
[02:29:55.410 --> 02:29:55.870]  How does it work?
[02:29:56.070 --> 02:30:02.652]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[02:30:02.812 --> 02:30:05.092]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[02:30:05.292 --> 02:30:10.614]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you!
[02:30:10.954 --> 02:30:11.435]  That's it?
[02:30:11.735 --> 02:30:13.237]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[02:30:13.497 --> 02:30:14.218]  It is easy.
[02:30:14.418 --> 02:30:21.125]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[02:30:21.406 --> 02:30:22.927]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[02:30:23.248 --> 02:30:23.948]  That's amazing!
[02:30:24.349 --> 02:30:29.715]  And, the bentonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[02:30:30.015 --> 02:30:30.356]  Well, how?
[02:30:30.556 --> 02:30:31.657]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[02:30:31.957 --> 02:30:34.780]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.

[02:30:42.668 --> 02:30:42.928]  Call today.
[02:31:11.498 --> 02:31:13.139]  Here's my call.
[02:31:13.179 --> 02:31:14.519]  Here's my call to action.
[02:31:14.559 --> 02:31:16.820]  I'll stop beating around the bush.
[02:31:40.695 --> 02:31:45.422]  We are creating this site that has all the answers on the vaccines.
[02:31:45.482 --> 02:31:47.005]  It has the info, the angles.
[02:31:47.025 --> 02:31:51.531]  It's going to get bigger and bigger, but very simple at the top and then get into more detail.
[02:31:53.134 --> 02:31:53.955]  We need your help.
[02:31:54.075 --> 02:31:55.978]  All the thousands of articles about
[02:31:57.436 --> 02:31:59.738]  Vaccinating children in Africa, and they all die.
[02:31:59.798 --> 02:32:01.879]  AP Reuters, all the years going back.
[02:32:02.600 --> 02:32:06.082]  Government documents, State Department Plan 200, we've got that.
[02:32:06.322 --> 02:32:08.764]  Where they said they were going to do all this, all the information.
[02:32:09.004 --> 02:32:14.468]  But it starts out with, hey, these things are bad, here's why they're bad, instead of just Jenny McCarthy, who hadn't gone down the rabbit hole yet.
[02:32:15.568 --> 02:32:24.754]  Though she calls her new book, Louder Than Words, that's the name of the loose change production company I'm partnered with, until they know what's going on, about autism.
[02:32:25.095 --> 02:32:27.016]  Well, it's a lot bigger than just that.
[02:32:27.668 --> 02:32:30.030]  Why is diabetes up 3,000 plus percent?
[02:32:30.270 --> 02:32:31.351]  It's not just the corn syrup.
[02:32:31.611 --> 02:32:37.575]  It's a cocktail of things, and they know what's going on, and in many cases, they're behind it and want it to happen.
[02:32:39.856 --> 02:32:41.117]  It's like Logan's Run, folks.
[02:32:41.137 --> 02:32:51.484]  They implant you with these cancer viruses that then, after a certain amount of cell replications, activate, and it's generally right after you've finished your working year, so they can suck all your savings out to the medical system.
[02:32:51.805 --> 02:32:55.087]  I mean, this is cold-blooded, done with military precision.
[02:32:56.554 --> 02:33:00.557]  I want you to tell everybody about the new section we're just now posting at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:33:00.597 --> 02:33:05.181]  You know, when you're getting your hair cut, go, go, hey, have you heard about vaccines hurting children?
[02:33:05.201 --> 02:33:06.242]  They'll go, yeah, yeah!
[02:33:06.262 --> 02:33:08.364]  Everybody will start talking, if they're not already talking about it.
[02:33:08.624 --> 02:33:14.669]  And tell them, yeah, go to PrisonPlanet.com, and on the left or right-hand side, we're going to put a permanent link, and they can click on that section.
[02:33:14.949 --> 02:33:22.335]  You can post, you're welcome to grab all the material we post, we want you to, and put it on your site, clone it, add to it.
[02:33:23.056 --> 02:33:25.258]  This is just about warning people!
[02:33:27.173 --> 02:33:31.017]  I mean, I want you to catch the same bug I've got.
[02:33:31.037 --> 02:33:35.702]  I want you to catch the same spirit I've got of wanting to warn people.
[02:33:35.722 --> 02:33:41.287]  I mean, I almost just tear myself apart with desire, of just frustrated desire to want to warn people.
[02:33:41.868 --> 02:33:46.253]  I mean, I don't... I mean, imagine, we can save millions of children from autism.
[02:33:46.833 --> 02:33:48.495]  It's millions and millions and millions.
[02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:51.522]  Tens of millions globally every couple years.
[02:33:51.602 --> 02:33:54.665]  We can save people from drinking sodium and stannous fluoride.
[02:33:55.225 --> 02:33:58.388]  We can hurt the enemy and make them push it on us different ways.
[02:33:58.428 --> 02:33:59.809]  We can stop them.
[02:33:59.849 --> 02:34:08.237]  We can stop... We can stop using cell phones up against our heads and use our hands free so we don't get the brain tumors that they absolutely admit they cause.
[02:34:08.317 --> 02:34:08.837]  No debate.
[02:34:08.857 --> 02:34:11.039]  We're going to create sections on all that.
[02:34:11.079 --> 02:34:12.380]  The whole eugenics attack.
[02:34:12.440 --> 02:34:13.161]  This is the key.
[02:34:13.521 --> 02:34:15.022]  We're going to post it at whatistheendgame.com.
[02:34:17.585 --> 02:34:22.688]  TruthNews.us, I'm asking you to make this the movement.
[02:34:23.808 --> 02:34:27.210]  I mean, you know, I said 9-11 was the key six years ago.
[02:34:27.470 --> 02:34:31.712]  Before 9-11 happened, I said government-sponsored terror is the key, and it's still one of the big keys.
[02:34:32.052 --> 02:34:33.012]  And we've exposed that.
[02:34:33.072 --> 02:34:35.453]  People now, psychologically, are aware of it.
[02:34:36.094 --> 02:34:38.375]  We now need to expose the eugenics program.
[02:34:38.555 --> 02:34:41.236]  That's their overarching operation.
[02:34:42.507 --> 02:34:44.428]  Because really no one's talking about this.
[02:34:44.468 --> 02:34:45.788]  They have little pieces of it.
[02:34:46.108 --> 02:34:47.448]  The government's dumb.
[02:34:48.009 --> 02:34:51.150]  They're dumb and don't know they didn't take the mercury out.
[02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:53.870]  They're not lying, they're just dumb.
[02:34:54.390 --> 02:34:55.871]  Of course they're lying!
[02:34:56.471 --> 02:35:10.395]  We've got the minutes of the heads of the CDC board, Centers for Disease Control, in 2000 with the head of the CDC saying, I don't give this to my grandchildren, tell all your families don't take it, but we've got to continue this operation.
[02:35:11.773 --> 02:35:12.593]  I mean, they know.
[02:35:12.653 --> 02:35:15.254]  Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, they know all about it.
[02:35:15.675 --> 02:35:16.815]  They made AIDS.
[02:35:17.615 --> 02:35:20.376]  We even have the Navy war funding for it in the 70s.
[02:35:21.077 --> 02:35:21.917]  They made it all.
[02:35:23.258 --> 02:35:26.199]  And you need to understand that.
[02:35:26.579 --> 02:35:29.180]  People need to stop hearing, oh, I heard AIDS was engineered.
[02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:30.140]  No, here's the documents.
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:32.681]  Oh, I heard they put cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[02:35:32.761 --> 02:35:33.682]  No, here's the documents.
[02:35:34.222 --> 02:35:35.902]  Oh, I heard you don't have to take a shot.
[02:35:35.982 --> 02:35:37.203]  Here's the waiver for your state.
[02:35:38.607 --> 02:35:39.908]  And by the way, the waiver's even a fraud.
[02:35:39.928 --> 02:35:40.608]  You don't even need that.
[02:35:40.628 --> 02:35:43.029]  You know, we need to educate people.
[02:35:43.129 --> 02:35:43.929]  I know they're dumb.
[02:35:43.969 --> 02:35:44.930]  I know they're brain damaged.
[02:35:45.230 --> 02:35:46.310]  I know they've been programmed.
[02:35:46.410 --> 02:35:48.231]  I'm beginning to realize it's not their fault.
[02:35:48.711 --> 02:35:51.332]  From birth, they were put in front of the television four hours a day.
[02:35:51.832 --> 02:35:53.153]  Patented, admitted mind control.
[02:35:53.173 --> 02:35:54.973]  They teach it in basic RTF.
[02:35:55.153 --> 02:35:59.315]  The public doesn't know there's mind control subliminals and flickering on TV when it's admitted in college.
[02:36:00.115 --> 02:36:00.916]  That's not even hidden.
[02:36:01.136 --> 02:36:01.616]  They don't know.
[02:36:02.076 --> 02:36:03.157]  Just like there's an NAU.
[02:36:03.197 --> 02:36:03.677]  They don't know.
[02:36:04.297 --> 02:36:05.057]  Alright, I'm gonna... Listen.
[02:36:05.538 --> 02:36:06.478]  I'm asking you.
[02:36:08.795 --> 02:36:11.958]  To please educate everyone now.
[02:36:14.340 --> 02:36:17.523]  This is an area that the people are listening, the people are waking up.
[02:36:17.543 --> 02:36:18.764]  It is now the time.
[02:36:19.085 --> 02:36:20.266]  Flashpoint has occurred.
[02:36:20.606 --> 02:36:21.807]  100th Monkey Syndrome has occurred.
[02:36:22.107 --> 02:36:24.209]  The people now are ready to hear the truth.
[02:36:24.490 --> 02:36:27.552]  And once they learn about the vaccines, they will directly go down the rabbit hole.
[02:36:27.833 --> 02:36:31.596]  That is a nexus doorway into learning about the big picture.
[02:36:31.856 --> 02:36:33.298]  We have to do this.
[02:36:34.435 --> 02:36:35.696]  We can do it.
[02:36:35.776 --> 02:36:37.497]  We can win with God's help.
[02:36:37.737 --> 02:36:39.498]  We can save a lot of people from this.
[02:36:40.839 --> 02:36:44.141]  I don't know if we can save the whole system and the whole thing, but I know we can save a lot of individuals.
[02:36:45.062 --> 02:36:51.786]  Now, I'm begging you, internet people, radio people, I'm begging other talk show hosts, you don't have to plug Alex Jones.
[02:36:51.806 --> 02:36:53.547]  You can say it's all your idea.
[02:36:53.567 --> 02:36:54.788]  In fact, that makes me safer.
[02:36:56.329 --> 02:36:57.950]  I don't care about all that stuff.
[02:36:57.970 --> 02:36:59.371]  You see, I see the big picture.
[02:37:00.936 --> 02:37:03.597]  I want to save people from being killed and being brain damaged.
[02:37:03.897 --> 02:37:05.418]  There's only one small area of it.
[02:37:06.558 --> 02:37:11.481]  So you go and talk about it and start websites and make films about it.
[02:37:12.441 --> 02:37:14.742]  We need to make this a major issue.
[02:37:17.803 --> 02:37:24.666]  Also, before I get into the financial news and some other global news here in the last 40 minutes of the transmission today.
[02:37:24.686 --> 02:37:26.507]  40 minutes, 20 minutes.
[02:37:26.587 --> 02:37:28.008]  We're 40 minutes in.
[02:37:30.504 --> 02:37:31.084]  Please!
[02:37:31.304 --> 02:37:33.726]  I've been so busy I didn't even plug in-game in the second hour.
[02:37:33.826 --> 02:37:36.447]  I'm going to show it in Austin next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
[02:37:36.467 --> 02:37:39.349]  And the next week, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, I'll be at the Monday shows.
[02:37:39.369 --> 02:37:41.069]  If you want tickets, InfoWars.com.
[02:37:41.110 --> 02:37:41.690]  Link's over there.
[02:37:42.170 --> 02:37:42.910]  It always sells out.
[02:37:42.930 --> 02:37:43.531]  I hope to see you there.
[02:37:43.551 --> 02:37:44.111]  Go ahead and get them.
[02:37:45.132 --> 02:37:47.113]  And also, go ahead and pre-order the DVD.
[02:37:47.153 --> 02:37:48.693]  I mean, it ships out November 1st.
[02:37:49.254 --> 02:37:50.294]  And we've got them.
[02:37:50.314 --> 02:37:55.137]  We're packaging them, getting them ready, shipping them out to you November 1st.
[02:37:56.590 --> 02:38:02.174]  We're shipping them out to you November 1st, or you can get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership and watch it in super high quality.
[02:38:02.194 --> 02:38:03.294]  It'll be out October 26th.
[02:38:03.595 --> 02:38:04.735]  That's only eight days away.
[02:38:05.856 --> 02:38:11.840]  And while you're at it, you can watch all my other films, and my book, and Paul Watson's book, and a bunch of other films that have been authorized to post, weekly TV reports.
[02:38:11.860 --> 02:38:15.983]  You can burn them to disk and use that as an armory of resistance to get the word out to people.
[02:38:17.484 --> 02:38:20.145]  Please get Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:38:20.505 --> 02:38:22.367]  When you get it, please make copies of it.
[02:38:22.427 --> 02:38:24.228]  Please get it out to everybody you know.
[02:38:25.467 --> 02:38:29.293]  Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
[02:38:30.299 --> 02:38:31.780]  Please warn people.
[02:38:32.181 --> 02:38:34.763]  Stop letting these murdering criminals get away with everything.
[02:38:34.783 --> 02:38:35.804]  That's all I ask.
[02:38:36.404 --> 02:38:47.153]  Infowars.com to order the DVD, PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day to get a membership, to endgame and everything else, thousands of pieces of media, or call 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or write to me, Alex Jones, 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:39:02.074 --> 02:39:02.774]  Our sponsors.
[02:39:03.414 --> 02:39:13.257]  That's how we fund this broadcast, but I bring you sponsors, and that's how I pay for the employees and the bandwidth and everything we do so we can just basically give you the films in many cases.
[02:39:13.838 --> 02:39:14.958]  I just want to get the word out.
[02:39:17.199 --> 02:39:19.439]  Now, I told you to buy gold when it was $325 an ounce in 2000.
[02:39:23.936 --> 02:39:24.076]  I think?
[02:39:46.064 --> 02:39:49.226]  That's all we had left, because the industry's gone, the intellectual property's gone.
[02:39:49.426 --> 02:39:57.310]  We're a mess already, and now they're killing what we had left, so we could engage in trade and have at least service jobs schlepping baubles.
[02:39:58.391 --> 02:40:03.733]  And Condoleezza Rice, big story on Tuesday, we broke here, is out bragging about how they're going to lower our wages.
[02:40:04.474 --> 02:40:10.717]  All these other global leaders, former Fed Chairman Greenspan says they want to hurt our... I mean, they want to hurt us!
[02:40:10.757 --> 02:40:11.397]  They say it!
[02:40:11.738 --> 02:40:12.958]  This is about global government!
[02:40:12.998 --> 02:40:14.439]  This is the destruction of the country!
[02:40:15.504 --> 02:40:16.984]  The yuppies just see the stock market at 14,000.
[02:40:17.184 --> 02:40:23.666]  They don't understand that's a 63% devalued dollar since 2000 euro index comparison.
[02:40:24.146 --> 02:40:26.266]  And so of course that's going to be increased.
[02:40:26.966 --> 02:40:28.327]  But that's really a stock market at 6,730.
[02:40:28.607 --> 02:40:33.127]  That's what it's really at.
[02:40:34.708 --> 02:40:36.288]  So here's Ted Anderson.
[02:40:36.308 --> 02:40:37.268]  He funds the whole network.
[02:40:37.288 --> 02:40:38.448]  He runs the whole shoot and match.
[02:40:38.969 --> 02:40:40.569]  And he also owns Modest Resources.
[02:40:40.589 --> 02:40:41.009]  He's been doing
[02:40:41.687 --> 02:40:44.170]  Gold trading for, I don't know, 23 years or something.
[02:40:44.471 --> 02:40:48.736]  He's had Midas for more than 10 years and I wouldn't be here doing this radio show right now if it wasn't for Ted.
[02:40:48.977 --> 02:40:49.778]  But let me tell you something.
[02:40:50.559 --> 02:40:52.261]  He has some gold coins left in their vault.
[02:40:53.533 --> 02:40:54.754]  I just had them written down.
[02:40:54.914 --> 02:40:58.836]  Quarter-ounce British Sovereigns at the price they were two weeks ago.
[02:40:59.376 --> 02:41:05.019]  This is so close to melt, and it has collector value on top of it, that it's ridiculous.
[02:41:05.179 --> 02:41:16.785]  Quarter-ounce gold coins, British Sovereigns, the most prized governmental-issued coin out there, right out of the New Order Empire, and he's got them at right close to melt.
[02:41:17.803 --> 02:41:18.523]  I think so.
[02:41:37.891 --> 02:41:40.254]  Because gold is only going to go up.
[02:41:40.334 --> 02:41:42.276]  I mean, it might drop $2 in a week.
[02:41:43.017 --> 02:41:45.599]  But if you watch the graph, it's only going straight up.
[02:41:45.679 --> 02:41:48.602]  I mean, $7.63 and rising.
[02:41:48.662 --> 02:41:50.284]  It passed that $7.50 mark.
[02:41:51.225 --> 02:41:54.789]  Even mainline news is saying it could go to $1,000 by the end of the year.
[02:41:54.849 --> 02:41:55.670]  What are you seeing, Ted?
[02:41:56.150 --> 02:41:57.431]  Well, there's no question about it.
[02:41:57.471 --> 02:42:00.432]  I'm not going to be surprised at all when I see $800 an ounce gold.
[02:42:00.452 --> 02:42:01.632]  We're just heading right toward it.
[02:42:01.752 --> 02:42:04.973]  Matter of fact, last time we were on air, gold has gone up $10 since then.
[02:42:05.714 --> 02:42:10.556]  The market has just been crazy hot and right now the big deal is the
[02:42:11.676 --> 02:42:16.058]  The debt, the credit in the United States has just been pushed to the limit.
[02:42:16.418 --> 02:42:20.039]  God, I wish we had listened to Ron Paul back when he was running for Libertarian President.
[02:42:20.059 --> 02:42:22.200]  I don't know why people are finally paying attention now.
[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:24.161]  I can just say thank God for that.
[02:42:24.241 --> 02:42:34.885]  I mean, because of the fact, I mean, right now, the biggest things that are going on right now are asset-backed securities like the collateralized debt obligations like home loans.
[02:42:36.105 --> 02:42:41.408]  And what did Paulson say Tuesday?
[02:42:41.448 --> 02:42:47.490]  He said, he told the banks, reissue more loans on people that can't pay the old ones.
[02:42:47.870 --> 02:42:49.751]  I mean, that's just going to make it even worse!
[02:42:50.571 --> 02:42:52.372]  It's just killing the U.S.
[02:42:52.412 --> 02:42:52.712]  dollar.
[02:42:52.752 --> 02:42:55.073]  The United States dollar is dropping like a rock.
[02:42:55.113 --> 02:42:57.234]  I mean, it's a down again today, just like you said.
[02:42:57.874 --> 02:42:59.436]  I'm totally freaked out, Ted.
[02:42:59.516 --> 02:43:01.218]  I mean, you know what this means.
[02:43:02.900 --> 02:43:13.551]  This is curtains, and the yuppies... Ted, I keep getting down on them, but I talk to people who are somewhat intelligent, and they have like a mental block to what's happening, but they go, yeah, but the stock market's up.
[02:43:13.791 --> 02:43:18.256]  And I go, don't you understand that that's a devalued dollar, so of course it's up?
[02:43:18.982 --> 02:43:23.624]  Yeah, well, you know, the stock market has been rising due to the same issue.
[02:43:23.664 --> 02:43:24.264]  But what do you want?
[02:43:24.284 --> 02:43:27.226]  Do you want to have something that is representing in paper?
[02:43:27.586 --> 02:43:32.088]  Or do you want to have something that actually represents value that's been valuable for over 6,000 years?
[02:43:32.488 --> 02:43:35.089]  I'm not saying the stock market doesn't have a shot at going up.
[02:43:35.370 --> 02:43:38.591]  Some of these companies will benefit from the falling dollar.
[02:43:38.651 --> 02:43:42.673]  But the point is, it's not up because it's with dollars that aren't worth more.
[02:43:43.133 --> 02:43:44.354]  And that's the whole point, Alex.
[02:43:44.394 --> 02:43:48.737]  I mean, the economy right now is in such horrible shape.
[02:43:49.157 --> 02:43:53.480]  And you know darn well that the stock market does not offer you a hedge against that bet.
[02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:54.701]  But gold does.
[02:43:54.961 --> 02:43:56.442]  Gold doesn't answer to anybody.
[02:43:56.462 --> 02:43:57.503]  It never goes bankrupt.
[02:43:57.583 --> 02:43:58.203]  It spends money.
[02:43:58.644 --> 02:44:02.546]  And when they opened up the Egyptian tombs, they didn't find stock certificates.
[02:44:02.826 --> 02:44:04.507]  They didn't find paper currency.
[02:44:04.748 --> 02:44:05.748]  They found gold.
[02:44:06.169 --> 02:44:11.612]  Gold has been used as money in the world here all the way up clean through 1971 here in the United States.
[02:44:12.793 --> 02:44:21.161]  Well, Ted, whether people want one silver coin or one gold coin or a hundred, you've got quite a few in stock at what you bought them for two weeks ago.
[02:44:21.181 --> 02:44:24.885]  And I called you and I said, I want you to give my listeners a really good deal.
[02:44:25.346 --> 02:44:26.286]  You have done that.
[02:44:26.367 --> 02:44:29.009]  This is as good a deal as you're going to find, ladies and gentlemen, believe me.
[02:44:29.350 --> 02:44:31.612]  I've looked around to buy a few coins here and there from other people.
[02:44:32.072 --> 02:44:36.094]  I just get them from Ted because he's very fair priced, but this is more than fair.
[02:44:36.435 --> 02:44:38.796]  This is a steal, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:38.836 --> 02:44:45.880]  Ted, after he pays his brokers, he's literally doing this for break-even, just to get you into gold so you understand the value.
[02:44:45.920 --> 02:44:47.101]  Ted, tell them about the deal.
[02:44:47.401 --> 02:44:48.222]  Yeah, OK.
[02:44:48.322 --> 02:44:51.385]  We're offering British sovereigns, just like you said.
[02:44:51.465 --> 02:44:54.148]  That's the coin that was issued by Britain, obviously.
[02:44:54.569 --> 02:44:56.030]  It's a quarter ounce gold piece.
[02:44:56.090 --> 02:45:00.855]  As far as I look at it, you're going to be able to shoot down the New World Order with their bullets.
[02:45:00.995 --> 02:45:02.297]  It makes me laugh.
[02:45:02.957 --> 02:45:18.166]  The coins are recognized across the entire planet and you can use them as money no matter where you go It's it's a great way to be getting involved in the precious metals industry in addition to this It's smaller Denomination so you don't have to get into you know It's hard to divide up a one ounce gold coin and buy what you need.
[02:45:18.506 --> 02:45:30.474]  This is a great size coin I can't think of a better coin to be offering especially at this particular time because You can search the internet and everything right now You're not gonna find British sovereigns right now for two or four for lower than 206
[02:45:31.654 --> 02:45:33.614]  That's a great buy on the coin.
[02:45:33.994 --> 02:45:36.235]  And then the silver dollars are like a sleeper, Alex.
[02:45:36.315 --> 02:45:41.716]  I mean, they're trading for twice the price of silver here just, what, five, maybe ten years ago.
[02:45:42.156 --> 02:45:44.696]  And right now, they're trading practically at spot.
[02:45:44.876 --> 02:46:00.539]  You know, and it's just, it's crazy to me that, you know, something that is in such finite supply, and I'm talking about the silver dollars from the turn of the century, the ones that Thomas Jefferson had us use in the Constitution for money, those are the silver dollars that I'm talking about right now, the Morgan and Pease dollars.
[02:46:01.079 --> 02:46:01.559]  Absolutely!
[02:46:01.579 --> 02:46:04.120]  Again, to explain this, the dollar has been massively devalued.
[02:46:04.140 --> 02:46:06.321]  That has not translated yet into silver, so silver has not adjusted.
[02:46:06.341 --> 02:46:07.382]  It is going to adjust if the laws of
[02:46:24.188 --> 02:46:24.348]  Yes, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:46:49.185 --> 02:46:49.485]  686-2237.
[02:46:50.206 --> 02:46:52.447]  Of course, you can come to GCNlive.com.

[02:47:07.437 --> 02:47:08.358]  Alex, you make it easy.
[02:47:08.398 --> 02:47:11.780]  All they have to do is click the dig button and it gets it out to millions of people.
[02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:16.163]  You know, if they just dig your stories and get it out there, that's gonna, that's what we need.
[02:47:16.203 --> 02:47:17.764]  We need to get the information out
[02:47:18.384 --> 02:47:21.065]  And the same thing is true in the economics right now.
[02:47:21.366 --> 02:47:28.649]  Again, I just reiterate, had we listened to Ron Paul ten years ago, we could have saved ourselves a lot of trouble.
[02:47:28.709 --> 02:47:29.649]  Well, I did listen to him.
[02:47:30.230 --> 02:47:41.675]  And I hope people listen now, because the IMF heads, the World Bank heads, I'm trying to find the actual articles, there's like three of them I had today, are now coming out and they're bad-mouthing the dollar further.
[02:47:41.995 --> 02:47:43.556]  They want it to drop further.
[02:47:44.116 --> 02:47:44.256]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:47:44.276 --> 02:47:46.998]  Just ask for the British Sovereign Deal at 206 or the Silver Dollar Rolls at 360.
[02:47:47.058 --> 02:47:49.499]  Tell them you heard it on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:49.519 --> 02:47:51.080]  It's going to go directly to help this broadcast.
[02:48:03.866 --> 02:48:04.847]  Every penny goes to that.
[02:48:04.887 --> 02:48:05.867]  It keeps this thing rolling.
[02:48:05.907 --> 02:48:06.588]  That's what we need.
[02:48:06.968 --> 02:48:08.029]  We need to get the word out.
[02:48:08.069 --> 02:48:08.949]  This is how we do it.
[02:48:10.070 --> 02:48:10.650]  Give them the number.
[02:48:10.670 --> 02:48:11.390]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:48:11.410 --> 02:48:13.111]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:48:13.492 --> 02:48:18.915]  And when they call, you've also got some free economic reports, too, right?
[02:48:19.015 --> 02:48:19.775]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:48:19.835 --> 02:48:20.535]  Corsi stuff.
[02:48:20.555 --> 02:48:21.556]  We've got all sorts of stuff.
[02:48:21.576 --> 02:48:24.297]  If you need information on the markets, just ask for it.
[02:48:24.317 --> 02:48:24.618]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:48:24.638 --> 02:48:28.660]  And what, brokers will be there until, what, 10 tonight?
[02:48:28.840 --> 02:48:29.200]  Oh, yeah.
[02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:30.401]  All night long.
[02:48:30.481 --> 02:48:32.502]  Up to about midnight, and then we'll be back in the morning.
[02:48:33.082 --> 02:48:33.402]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:48:33.422 --> 02:48:40.085]  Again, I brought Ted in here, folks, because he has gold at two weeks ago's prices.
[02:48:40.786 --> 02:48:42.487]  It's gone up $10 in two weeks.
[02:48:42.867 --> 02:48:44.347]  He's got it at the price two weeks ago.
[02:48:44.387 --> 02:48:46.708]  Give him a call.
[02:48:46.728 --> 02:48:47.009]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:48:51.331 --> 02:48:52.751]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:53.812 --> 02:48:54.852]  A new world order.
[02:48:55.573 --> 02:48:58.274]  In the near future, Earth is dominating.
[02:48:59.074 --> 02:49:00.675]  There are holes in dark rubrics.
[02:49:02.054 --> 02:49:02.295]  We're good.
