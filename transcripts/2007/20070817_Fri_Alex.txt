[00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:06.312]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:08.013]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:09.873]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:11.314]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:12.995]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:17.296]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:21.938]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.523 --> 00:00:32.624]  Yeah.
[00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:03.252]  Wake up, boys, there's a light at the window.
[00:01:05.112 --> 00:01:08.513]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[00:01:10.293 --> 00:01:14.854]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet.
[00:01:15.634 --> 00:01:18.995]  And they whisper the word, REVOLUTION.
[00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:24.876]  There are men coming down from the valleys.
[00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:53.061]  There are tall ships flying on the coast And they carry the light in the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind Bring my gun and a handful of silver By the sea we will gather for the fight
[00:01:55.482 --> 00:02:16.146]  It's been so many years So many tears We have lost once before Now we'll settle the score When our cannons will roar Revolution!
[00:02:20.687 --> 00:02:24.888]  Watch and wait Get ready for the sign
[00:02:25.723 --> 00:02:29.306]  There are many here among us who do not yet know the time.
[00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:32.268]  Watch and wait.
[00:02:32.388 --> 00:02:33.749]  Get ready for the sign.
[00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.731]  There are many here among us now who have not seen the light.
[00:02:38.031 --> 00:02:41.614]  We must say the word to all the people in the land.
[00:02:41.894 --> 00:02:44.596]  We go to every hill and mountain all the time.
[00:03:07.947 --> 00:03:09.148]  We're good to go.
[00:03:51.557 --> 00:03:56.601]  Another incredibly important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:03:56.621 --> 00:04:01.265]  The news of yesterday has only been magnified and intensified.
[00:04:01.285 --> 00:04:07.350]  The waters we are in are very deep, very dark, and very dangerous.
[00:04:08.671 --> 00:04:15.897]  We're not going to be talking about the Storm Dean coming into the Mediterranean, lined up to collide.
[00:04:18.812 --> 00:04:20.774]  With Jamaica and then possibly Texas.
[00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:23.876]  We'll be talking about the real storm.
[00:04:24.877 --> 00:04:35.726]  The storm of tyranny that is coming down upon us and that finally is shaking a lot of people out of their apathy and their resistance to the truth.
[00:04:35.806 --> 00:04:42.351]  When we get back, you will have to have internal passports to travel.
[00:04:42.944 --> 00:04:44.445]  We've been talking about this for years.
[00:04:45.065 --> 00:04:49.227]  Now they've thrown down the gauntlet and are admitting it's an internal passport.
[00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:55.230]  Coupled with the secret police being shut up nationwide with SCSI tattletale squadrons.
[00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.332]  Neocons have openly said, make Bush dictator.
[00:05:03.146 --> 00:05:04.167]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:05:04.507 --> 00:05:07.290]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.714]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:05:12.154 --> 00:05:12.975]  So what do you do?
[00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:17.860]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.482]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:05:20.962 --> 00:05:21.843]  Sheltering in Place.
[00:05:22.263 --> 00:05:25.986]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[00:05:26.286 --> 00:05:35.673]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:06:10.076 --> 00:06:17.688]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:25.444]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.864 --> 00:06:37.291]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.591 --> 00:06:41.094]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.554 --> 00:06:43.495]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.835 --> 00:06:47.598]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:08.537]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry, and I'm a plastic surgeon, and I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.
[00:07:08.697 --> 00:07:11.198]  But I want to tell you today about a product that I developed.

[00:07:27.225 --> 00:07:28.005]  What does this all mean?

[00:07:52.054 --> 00:07:54.936]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:54.956 --> 00:07:56.497]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:07:56.517 --> 00:07:56.778]  Headline!
[00:07:56.798 --> 00:07:57.778]  The FBI wants you!
[00:08:15.524 --> 00:08:19.669]  To fight crime and secretly report on your neighbors.
[00:08:20.369 --> 00:08:22.992]  This out of Farm Week newspaper.
[00:08:24.554 --> 00:08:27.897]  Headline, Neocons, make Bush dictator of the world.
[00:08:28.298 --> 00:08:37.007]  A powerful neocon think tank headed up by former CIA director James Woolsey openly says, make Bush dictator of the world.
[00:08:37.831 --> 00:08:42.574]  In the United States, ladies and gentlemen, openly announced.
[00:08:42.634 --> 00:08:49.838]  You see, when they come out and say 9-11, another 9-11 would be good, when they come out and say we need to be dictators, they're not joking around.
[00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:52.340]  Remember Salon Magazine a few weeks ago?
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:09:03.426]  Where this pretty much mainline conservative was out at the beach with her rich Republican friends, middle-aged women, and they're going, I can't wait to gas chamber all of the people that disagree.
[00:09:03.907 --> 00:09:06.208]  We're soon going to be killing everyone!
[00:09:06.886 --> 00:09:08.167]  And they're actually saying this.
[00:09:08.207 --> 00:09:08.887]  You understand?
[00:09:08.907 --> 00:09:12.889]  They plan to line us up and shoot us.
[00:09:15.351 --> 00:09:16.952]  I keep telling everybody this.
[00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:23.155]  It's so bad, it's off the chart.
[00:09:23.775 --> 00:09:31.720]  And Homeland Security says you're going to have to have passports to drive around the roads, go to national parks, get on planes.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.582]  We'll tell you what all this means, ladies and gentlemen, coming up a little bit later.
[00:09:37.136 --> 00:09:38.776]  But right now I'm feeling patriotic.
[00:09:38.796 --> 00:09:41.317]  I want people to remember what this country was founded on.
[00:09:41.377 --> 00:09:42.137]  What it's all about.
[00:09:42.237 --> 00:09:43.157]  Land of the free.
[00:09:43.737 --> 00:09:44.578]  Home of the brave.
[00:09:44.698 --> 00:09:49.039]  Not land of the surveilled police state run by the military industrial complex.
[00:09:52.239 --> 00:09:54.620]  And it's just the news every day intensifies.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:04.182]  I wouldn't be here on air freaking out right now and have a guest on about the Federal Reserve or about what's happening in Iraq or what's going on with the economy which we're going to be covering.
[00:10:05.078 --> 00:10:14.986]  I'd be talking about that stuff, but I have to talk about martial law when they're making every move and every preparation and saying they're planning to do it.
[00:10:15.727 --> 00:10:17.728]  I mean, we gotta talk about this!
[00:10:21.271 --> 00:10:29.778]  Right now, though, here is Steve Ross, the best patriot musician out there, with Renegades, and this is a salute to all of you out there.
[00:10:32.714 --> 00:10:45.701]  Young, Black, White, North, South, East, West, British, Chinese, South African, Mexican, I mean if you're in Mexico, people all over the world, German,
[00:10:47.242 --> 00:10:56.390]  People in Israel, people in Rwanda, people in Australia, wherever you're listening to, you love freedom, and you stood up for freedom, and you know we're facing tyranny.
[00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:01.654]  And you've supported this broadcast, and you've gotten the word out in your area, and you fought the New World Order.
[00:11:01.955 --> 00:11:02.915]  This song's for you.
[00:11:03.236 --> 00:11:04.177]  I salute you.
[00:11:04.197 --> 00:11:11.703]  We are brothers, we are sisters, we are family together in this historical fight, and I'm just honored and blessed to know you.
[00:11:12.143 --> 00:11:12.744]  I salute you.
[00:11:26.154 --> 00:11:35.640]  From Azeroth he came with a ragtag band to bring a revolution.
[00:11:39.262 --> 00:11:45.325]  Some would make him king, and others couldn't stand for that.
[00:11:45.365 --> 00:11:51.209]  The cross was a solution, but he rose again.
[00:11:53.167 --> 00:11:57.629]  Wise men follow him, if he roams again.
[00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.191]  Wise men follow him.
[00:12:01.771 --> 00:12:05.933]  Thank God for the ready meat.
[00:12:06.553 --> 00:12:09.255]  And the life he leads.
[00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:12.976]  For the head of the train.
[00:12:13.617 --> 00:12:15.517]  Without the ready meat.
[00:12:21.614 --> 00:12:35.567]  A wonderful host of heroes who renegade your mind.
[00:12:36.568 --> 00:12:41.773]  They railed against the crowd with another ragtag band.
[00:12:43.416 --> 00:12:46.897]  Declaring independence.
[00:12:49.158 --> 00:12:51.438]  Lay their bodies down.
[00:12:52.259 --> 00:12:54.519]  On a bloody wall.
[00:12:55.719 --> 00:12:58.720]  A liberty for their descendants.
[00:13:00.061 --> 00:13:03.081]  Thanks to the renegades.
[00:13:03.382 --> 00:13:06.542]  A free day.
[00:13:06.602 --> 00:13:08.363]  Thanks to the renegades.
[00:13:10.369 --> 00:13:13.790]  I'm afraid today.
[00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:18.251]  Thank God for the renegades.
[00:13:18.291 --> 00:13:24.072]  When the lines they meet are ahead of their time.
[00:13:24.192 --> 00:13:31.393]  Without the renegades, Lord knows where we'd be.
[00:13:31.433 --> 00:13:35.054]  When a bunch of heroes renegade to life,
[00:13:58.159 --> 00:14:03.942]  Where come the renegades in the world today?
[00:14:04.322 --> 00:14:08.885]  Who are the renegades in the world today?
[00:14:08.945 --> 00:14:21.151]  Thank God for the renegades and the lives they lead far ahead of their time.
[00:14:23.818 --> 00:14:30.762]  When it comes to heroes, Renegades are mine.
[00:14:50.268 --> 00:14:51.388]  And you are mine.
[00:14:51.688 --> 00:14:52.609]  And I am yours.
[00:14:52.709 --> 00:14:54.149]  We are together.
[00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:58.270]  And I do take possession of the name Renegade.
[00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:07.152]  I do take possession of you as my friends and my brothers and my sisters in this holy fight against the New World Order and Satan and all his pomps.
[00:15:07.592 --> 00:15:11.973]  And make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, that is exactly what we're fighting.
[00:15:13.173 --> 00:15:23.342]  Chicken-necked, evil, wicked Chertoff and that degenerate, wheatling George Bush and that bobble-headed Karl Rove!
[00:15:23.962 --> 00:15:35.772]  All of them are nothing but front men for the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and that Sachs-Coburg Goethe sitting over there on the throne of England and the throne of Orange in the Netherlands!
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:43.965]  They are all enemies of every free man, woman, and child on the planet!
[00:15:44.626 --> 00:15:54.235]  For us to continue, for our progeny and our offspring to live free, they must fall.
[00:15:54.635 --> 00:15:57.958]  They have declared eternal warfare against free humanity.
[00:15:58.279 --> 00:16:00.881]  They must and they will and they have
[00:16:02.992 --> 00:16:05.935]  In the future, been defeated already.
[00:16:06.276 --> 00:16:10.060]  The question is, how bad is it going to be in this fight against these individuals?
[00:16:11.402 --> 00:16:12.343]  Alright, let me settle down.
[00:16:14.285 --> 00:16:18.390]  Getting ready for this radio show, I sit here and I go, you know what?
[00:16:19.891 --> 00:16:22.895]  I would be abnormal if I didn't get on air and get upset.
[00:16:23.709 --> 00:16:24.509]  I've said it many times.
[00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:46.134]  Many of you take it as normal and natural, and the media and the culture, the twisted, sick culture of death, tells you getting excited, painting yourself up in simulated war paint, going to a gladiatorial diversion, a prosthesis of true warfare, a facsimile, a crutch, and yelling and screaming and hyperventilating over things that don't matter is normal?
[00:16:46.534 --> 00:16:47.434]  That is abnormal!
[00:16:48.516 --> 00:17:15.408]  Getting upset about the total loss of freedom, the destruction of our Republic, and to see our entire civilization, and all of our women and children, and I say this as a man, going into bondage, and I haven't experienced bondage, like many who have have come from other countries, but I have studied bondage, and I have a good idea what it's like, and I have felt the tendrils of it as it begins,
[00:17:16.371 --> 00:17:19.514]  And let me tell you, it is a sad state indeed.
[00:17:20.254 --> 00:17:28.882]  One of servitude, and ignorance, and great sorrow, and poorness.
[00:17:32.465 --> 00:17:32.965]  You want it?
[00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:39.231]  You're gonna get it, you smiley-faced, giggling, demonic America.
[00:17:40.638 --> 00:17:53.206]  But I speak to those, and there are tens of millions of people who do not like evil, and do not like all this corruption and all these lies, and I'm telling you folks, we've got a fight on our hands, because this enemy is a-coming.
[00:17:55.207 --> 00:18:07.195]  Now I've been saying, hey, they probably won't have martial law, they may not have martial law, they're sure making preparations for it, they'll probably just glide on into Hillary, and then have some stage to vent around that point, but I said they could go either way,
[00:18:08.115 --> 00:18:14.118]  And I said, they certainly, if they continue to intensify what they've been doing or accelerate it, it looks like that's going to happen.
[00:18:14.138 --> 00:18:29.706]  And when I say the trajectory is online for martial law in the next six months, if they currently continue to ratchet things up at the level and pace they're ratcheting them up this week or in the last month, we'll be in martial law within two months.
[00:18:32.643 --> 00:18:44.486]  I like to be a little more conservative and hopefully they're going to slow down a bit, but still even with a massive decrease in their acceleration, we're talking about full bore, real deal martial law within six months.
[00:18:44.526 --> 00:18:47.527]  Now, let's be clear, I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[00:18:49.588 --> 00:18:54.589]  I'm telling you they are preparing for it and moving to do it.
[00:18:57.731 --> 00:19:16.868]  I think it's a desperate gamble by these people, but the aplomb, the chutzpah, the whatever you want to call it, is just the hubris is, and it may be well-founded, it may not be hubris, it may be confidence, but from where I'm sitting it looks like delusional hubris.
[00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:20.556]  I mean, they can crush us, folks, but they're going to break themselves.
[00:19:20.576 --> 00:19:29.198]  Like a big statue, you know, a big 100-foot stone statue can fall on a crowd of people and kill them, but the stone statue's going to shatter, too, breaking five or six big pieces.
[00:19:30.639 --> 00:19:33.739]  But it's their nature, and frankly, they're a bunch of nihilists up there.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:40.641]  They want to keep on willing, as one futurist said, and so even if it means destruction and death, they want to go on willing.
[00:19:40.661 --> 00:19:42.402]  That's why Stalin and Hitler did what they did.
[00:19:42.782 --> 00:19:43.942]  It's all part of turning east.
[00:19:44.963 --> 00:19:45.943]  Napoleon, Hitler, both.
[00:19:49.404 --> 00:19:54.013]  So when we get back, the big news, and just like yesterday, call everybody you know, folks.
[00:19:54.093 --> 00:19:55.595]  It got worse since yesterday.
[00:19:55.615 --> 00:19:57.759]  I haven't even gotten to the news yet.
[00:19:57.839 --> 00:19:58.801]  Brace yourselves.
[00:19:59.082 --> 00:19:59.663]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:03.573 --> 00:20:08.078]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:08.418 --> 00:20:12.522]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:12.802 --> 00:20:13.363]  We listened.
[00:20:13.663 --> 00:20:18.648]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:18.928 --> 00:20:19.409]  We listened.
[00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:22.832]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:23.252 --> 00:20:23.773]  We listened.
[00:20:24.233 --> 00:20:28.296]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:20:28.696 --> 00:20:29.177]  We listened.
[00:20:29.517 --> 00:20:34.761]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:20:35.181 --> 00:20:36.542]  Again, we listened.
[00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:39.104]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity
[00:20:39.264 --> 00:20:39.764]  We're good to go.
[00:21:00.712 --> 00:21:06.917]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:07.377 --> 00:21:15.163]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:15.504 --> 00:21:23.350]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:28.392]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:28.753 --> 00:21:33.455]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:33.975 --> 00:21:37.817]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:38.317 --> 00:21:39.338]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:39.418 --> 00:21:43.440]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:48.284]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:48.804 --> 00:21:51.366]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:21:51.807 --> 00:21:53.488]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.588 --> 00:21:53.808]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.129 --> 00:22:03.190]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:12.733]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:13.173 --> 00:22:20.375]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:21.104 --> 00:22:26.610]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:22:27.091 --> 00:22:37.924]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:22:38.684 --> 00:22:40.707]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:22:44.068 --> 00:22:44.388]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:23:00.604 --> 00:23:03.086]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:03.786 --> 00:23:07.408]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[00:23:08.048 --> 00:23:11.951]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[00:23:12.631 --> 00:23:21.196]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[00:23:22.182 --> 00:23:29.366]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[00:23:30.287 --> 00:23:38.411]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:39.512 --> 00:23:42.014]  Just call our toll-free order line number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:42.034 --> 00:23:42.834]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:51.939 --> 00:23:52.839]  516-8736.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.201]  Call now.
[00:23:55.261 --> 00:23:58.504]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:23:58.524 --> 00:24:04.910]  No, this is not America.
[00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:05.970]  This is not America.
[00:24:16.796 --> 00:24:19.177]  Speak of the devil.
[00:24:19.197 --> 00:24:21.597]  Speak of dying for the system.
[00:24:22.057 --> 00:24:26.438]  Cue up that little MSNBC slash CNBC reporter.
[00:24:46.058 --> 00:24:48.760]  To be technical, she's a CNBC reporter on MSNBC.
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:58.809]  A couple days ago, I guess now on Monday, saying, hey, poison food, poison toys, we don't want to make China stop that or it'll hurt our economy.
[00:25:00.071 --> 00:25:02.553]  Talk about dying for the system, here it is.
[00:25:03.831 --> 00:25:09.796]  About inflation, that's another interesting point because a lot of people like to say scare monger about China, right?
[00:25:09.816 --> 00:25:12.418]  A lot of politicians, and I know you talk about that issue all the time.
[00:25:12.758 --> 00:25:14.740]  I think people should be careful what they wish for on China.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:23.606]  You know, if China were to revalue its currency or China is to start making, say, toys that don't have lead in them or food that isn't poisonous, their costs of production are going to go up.
[00:25:23.667 --> 00:25:27.149]  And that means prices at Walmart here in the United States are going to go up too.
[00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:29.791]  So I would say China is our greatest friend right now.
[00:25:29.811 --> 00:25:32.794]  They're keeping prices low and they're keeping prices for mortgages low too.
[00:25:34.192 --> 00:25:44.240]  Just in case you missed it, let's, in a second play it one more time, and we'll get into all the new news for you, because I want you to realize the magnitude of what we're dealing with.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.402]  First off, it wasn't fear-mongering.
[00:25:48.763 --> 00:25:52.926]  A bunch of dogs and cats died because it had plastic in the food.
[00:25:53.971 --> 00:25:56.233]  And then humans got sick from it, and they kept it real quiet.
[00:25:56.253 --> 00:26:00.676]  They just had a botulism recall of hundreds of thousands of cans of different meat sauces.
[00:26:00.716 --> 00:26:01.797]  People are dying all over.
[00:26:02.037 --> 00:26:03.118]  That's being kept real quiet.
[00:26:03.138 --> 00:26:07.061]  It was on the newswire two weeks ago, but used to have been a huge story.
[00:26:07.462 --> 00:26:20.412]  Believe me, they're keeping it real quiet that the bridges are falling down, and computers are breaking down, and government's falling apart, and corruption is just running rampant, and the government's just grabbing goods for themselves, and the elite are all running offshore right now.
[00:26:20.432 --> 00:26:23.034]  It's all being kept real quiet, lady.
[00:26:24.737 --> 00:26:25.437]  But listen to her.
[00:26:26.458 --> 00:26:28.759]  Just like we have newscasts saying mercury is good for your children.
[00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:29.099]  Take it.
[00:26:29.119 --> 00:26:29.679]  It's good for you.
[00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:31.340]  It's a new nutritional item for your brain.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.380]  Very nutritive.
[00:26:34.241 --> 00:26:34.881]  Very nutritious.
[00:26:35.221 --> 00:26:35.761]  Very healthful.
[00:26:36.802 --> 00:26:42.264]  Here she is saying, if they don't have poison in their food or lead in their toys, I mean, this is gonna hurt us!
[00:26:43.984 --> 00:26:46.845]  You see, this is the mass delusion, folks!
[00:26:47.886 --> 00:26:51.487]  See, we're the same people, but to them we're insane!
[00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:53.431]  Here it is.
[00:27:11.407 --> 00:27:16.570]  Their costs of production are going to go up, and that means prices at Walmart here in the United States are going to go up, too.
[00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.151]  So, I would say China is our greatest friend right now.
[00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:22.473]  They're keeping prices low, and they're keeping prices for mortgages low, too.
[00:27:23.013 --> 00:27:27.816]  I mean, these people are... I mean, by the way, we're not just selectively grabbing something here.
[00:27:28.256 --> 00:27:30.097]  I've got a bunch of clips almost as bad.
[00:27:31.037 --> 00:27:33.739]  I mean, it's entered a new dimension.
[00:27:34.685 --> 00:27:35.566]  of delusionalness.
[00:27:35.946 --> 00:27:38.468]  And you see, they all stick together.
[00:27:39.008 --> 00:27:44.673]  Once Hitler's regime, other regimes start going downhill, they start only listening to each other.
[00:27:45.493 --> 00:27:47.395]  And then their craziness becomes normal.
[00:27:49.196 --> 00:28:01.165]  And that's why one of the top neocons, one of the top neocon groups in the country, and I have the news article, this is being openly put out,
[00:28:02.342 --> 00:28:10.250]  Neocons, quote, make Bush dictator of the United States and the world, fully suspend the Constitution.
[00:28:12.733 --> 00:28:23.984]  Now, this is the big article today, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com, and coupled with yesterday's news, where, when we broke a year ago, they recruited tens of thousands of preachers,
[00:28:25.721 --> 00:28:27.042]  And again, they kept it secret.
[00:28:27.062 --> 00:28:28.622]  They told them, this is a secret program.
[00:28:28.722 --> 00:28:29.522]  Tell no one.
[00:28:29.722 --> 00:28:30.943]  Go give sermons.
[00:28:31.163 --> 00:28:32.783]  Getting them ready for gun confiscation.
[00:28:32.823 --> 00:28:33.904]  Ready to go to FEMA camps.
[00:28:34.364 --> 00:28:36.385]  Ready to have their families split up.
[00:28:36.725 --> 00:28:38.145]  Ready for forced inoculations.
[00:28:38.185 --> 00:28:39.025]  Don't tell anyone.
[00:28:39.926 --> 00:28:41.086]  You're part of the first wave of 13,000.
[00:28:41.126 --> 00:28:43.027]  We'll be up to 26,000 double by the summer of 2007.
[00:28:43.127 --> 00:28:44.347]  And Pastor Butch's website
[00:28:50.382 --> 00:28:52.704]  PastorButch.com has hundreds of those documents.
[00:28:52.724 --> 00:28:55.106]  We've got dozens up on InfoWars and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:55.126 --> 00:28:55.986]  You can go read them.
[00:28:56.467 --> 00:29:02.652]  And then they fired him from the hospital over and he still has his church, but they tracked back who he was, where he faxed it from to us.
[00:29:04.533 --> 00:29:06.114]  It was a grocery store nearby.
[00:29:06.535 --> 00:29:09.137]  Homeland Security came after him and he won't come on air now.
[00:29:09.497 --> 00:29:14.181]  But since then, now, you do a Google search on this, this is what's important.
[00:29:16.322 --> 00:29:17.463]  Now it's all over.
[00:29:17.543 --> 00:29:18.564]  Now they're announcing it.
[00:29:18.584 --> 00:29:19.485]  Now they're going public.
[00:29:20.419 --> 00:29:24.161]  You see, now they're saying, yeah, we got spy satellites watching you.
[00:29:24.381 --> 00:29:26.262]  Yeah, we're listening to your phone calls without warrants.
[00:29:26.882 --> 00:29:28.502]  Yeah, you gotta have a domestic passport.
[00:29:29.043 --> 00:29:30.543]  And yeah, we got spies everywhere.
[00:29:31.124 --> 00:29:32.984]  And the preachers are under our control.
[00:29:33.364 --> 00:29:34.705]  Ha ha, that's freedom, buddy.
[00:29:35.305 --> 00:29:36.886]  That's how America's supposed to work.
[00:29:37.306 --> 00:29:38.947]  That's what Stalin did.
[00:29:38.967 --> 00:29:40.187]  That's what Mao did.
[00:29:40.207 --> 00:29:41.608]  That's what the Stasi did.
[00:29:41.628 --> 00:29:42.828]  That's what we do.
[00:29:42.868 --> 00:29:43.969]  It's freedom, boy.
[00:29:43.989 --> 00:29:44.989]  You don't lock it up.
[00:29:51.642 --> 00:29:52.563]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.023 --> 00:29:54.645]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.565 --> 00:29:58.328]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.429 --> 00:30:02.471]  Hey, Emily.
[00:30:02.771 --> 00:30:03.592]  Wow, you look great.
[00:30:04.289 --> 00:30:05.090]  I feel great.
[00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.231]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[00:30:07.652 --> 00:30:07.972]  Really?
[00:30:08.132 --> 00:30:08.612]  What is it?
[00:30:08.733 --> 00:30:09.193]  How does it work?
[00:30:09.313 --> 00:30:16.278]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[00:30:16.599 --> 00:30:18.861]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[00:30:19.241 --> 00:30:24.365]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[00:30:24.865 --> 00:30:25.346]  That's it?
[00:30:25.586 --> 00:30:27.167]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[00:30:27.488 --> 00:30:28.188]  It is easy.
[00:30:28.469 --> 00:30:35.135]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:30:35.395 --> 00:30:36.736]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[00:30:36.936 --> 00:30:37.717]  That's amazing!
[00:30:38.057 --> 00:30:43.402]  And, the benzenite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:30:43.662 --> 00:30:43.963]  Wow!
[00:30:44.143 --> 00:30:45.224]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[00:30:45.664 --> 00:30:48.668]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[00:30:48.768 --> 00:30:52.653]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[00:30:52.873 --> 00:30:53.333]  Or call 1-800-317-9547.
[00:30:53.393 --> 00:30:53.614]  That's 800-317-9547.
[00:31:01.474 --> 00:31:04.395]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:31:04.575 --> 00:31:09.796]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:31:10.096 --> 00:31:15.397]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:31:15.797 --> 00:31:16.918]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:17.278 --> 00:31:26.180]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:26.580]  Yes!
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.202]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[00:32:01.349 --> 00:32:03.310]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:06.652]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:32:06.932 --> 00:32:11.774]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:32:12.074 --> 00:32:14.836]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:32:15.096 --> 00:32:19.798]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[00:32:20.098 --> 00:32:22.019]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[00:32:22.499 --> 00:32:32.384]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[00:32:32.764 --> 00:32:37.487]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[00:32:37.767 --> 00:32:41.328]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[00:32:41.569 --> 00:32:43.730]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:46.211]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings,
[00:32:46.411 --> 00:32:48.192]  We'll even refund the shipping charge!
[00:32:48.532 --> 00:32:51.654]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now!
[00:32:51.874 --> 00:32:52.795]  What are you waiting for?
[00:32:52.975 --> 00:32:53.655]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[00:32:53.755 --> 00:32:54.255]  That's 1-888-873-7971 today!
[00:33:02.205 --> 00:33:05.429]  Agents, we are armed!
[00:33:05.709 --> 00:33:07.991]  I think this song says it all.
[00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:13.397]  We're going to roll with Paris, and I'm going to get into the news directly.
[00:33:23.397 --> 00:33:32.670]  It just gets worse by the minute as the Marshall Law is openly announced and as the neocons call for Sage Tarrer and Bush to be Supreme Dictator.
[00:33:45.419 --> 00:33:50.982]  I see a message from the government, like every day I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[00:33:51.282 --> 00:33:55.244]  They wanted me about Osama or whatever, picture me buying this scam.
[00:33:55.284 --> 00:33:56.125]  I said never.
[00:33:56.505 --> 00:33:58.986]  You in tune to a hard truth soldier spitting.
[00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:01.608]  I stay committed, give up, because I lose commission.
[00:34:01.808 --> 00:34:04.329]  It's all a part of fighting devil's state mind control.
[00:34:04.429 --> 00:34:06.930]  And all about the battle for your body, mind and soul.
[00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:09.552]  And now I'm hoping you don't close your mind so they shape you.
[00:34:09.752 --> 00:34:12.073]  Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us aids and raped us.
[00:34:12.253 --> 00:34:14.655]  Another push season mean another war for profit.
[00:34:14.956 --> 00:34:17.258]  All is secret so the public never stick to stop it.
[00:34:17.338 --> 00:34:20.101]  The Illuminati, triple six, all connected.
[00:34:20.121 --> 00:34:22.503]  So the votes they control the race and take elections.
[00:34:22.663 --> 00:34:25.086]  It's the stolen bones, remakes and kill committee.
[00:34:25.366 --> 00:34:27.228]  See the dragon get eaten up in every city.
[00:34:43.902 --> 00:34:44.489]  We're good.
[00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:51.132]  Now ask yourself who's the one with the most to gain.
[00:34:51.152 --> 00:34:53.774]  For 9-11 monsters couldn't stand his name.
[00:34:53.874 --> 00:34:56.476]  Now even now he's waving flags like they lost their mind.
[00:34:56.736 --> 00:34:59.018]  Everybody got opinions but don't know the time.
[00:34:59.278 --> 00:35:01.720]  Cause America's been took, it's plain to see.
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.081]  The oldest trick in the book is make your enemy.
[00:35:04.361 --> 00:35:06.823]  A phony evil so the government can do its dirt.
[00:35:07.003 --> 00:35:09.325]  And take over your freedom, lock and load, get in search.
[00:35:09.345 --> 00:35:12.047]  Ain't nothing changed but more colored people locked in prison.
[00:35:12.087 --> 00:35:14.649]  These pigs still beat us but it seems we forgetting.
[00:35:14.809 --> 00:35:17.171]  But I remember 4 September how these devils do it.
[00:35:17.631 --> 00:35:19.912]  Giuliani asked Diallo how he's doing.
[00:35:19.992 --> 00:35:22.692]  We in the streets, holler jail to the thief, fall apart.
[00:35:22.712 --> 00:35:24.753]  Waving flag, bring these dragons to their knees.
[00:35:25.113 --> 00:35:27.274]  Oil, blood, money, make these killers ride cold.
[00:35:27.474 --> 00:35:29.975]  Suspicious suicide, people dying never told.
[00:35:29.995 --> 00:35:32.995]  It's all a part of playing God, so you think we need him?
[00:35:33.035 --> 00:35:35.536]  While being ass-crossed, take away your rights to freedom.
[00:35:35.796 --> 00:35:38.117]  Bear witness to the sickness of these dictators.
[00:35:38.397 --> 00:35:40.778]  Hope you understand the time, brother, cause it's major.
[00:35:41.018 --> 00:35:42.098]  We're good to go.
[00:36:01.636 --> 00:36:04.318]  So now you askin' why my records always come the same?
[00:36:04.518 --> 00:36:07.000]  Keep it real, ain't no fillers, ain't no censors blingin'.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.302]  My nods seem the gory of the comin' of the beast.
[00:36:09.542 --> 00:36:11.864]  So every story, every word I'm sayin' is a beast.
[00:36:12.204 --> 00:36:14.626]  See, you could witness the Illuminati body count.
[00:36:14.786 --> 00:36:17.268]  Don't be surprised, these is devils that I'm talkin' bout.
[00:36:17.348 --> 00:36:19.790]  You think a couple thousand lies means it's the killers?
[00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:21.732]  Nigga, I swear to God, we the ones.
[00:36:21.852 --> 00:36:25.174]  Ain't no villains, or any other word they think to demonize a country.
[00:36:25.375 --> 00:36:27.156]  Ain't no terror threaten, less approval ratin'
[00:36:27.396 --> 00:36:28.378]  We're good to go.
[00:36:41.175 --> 00:36:43.357]  I'm talking loud but ain't nobody saying it.
[00:36:43.537 --> 00:36:45.838]  And with the 4th Amendment going out, I own the 1st.
[00:36:45.878 --> 00:36:48.460]  That's why I'm spitting cyanide each and every verse.
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.342]  I see the Carlisle group in Harris Bank accounts.
[00:36:51.382 --> 00:36:53.784]  I see them plead the 5th each and every section now.
[00:36:53.964 --> 00:36:56.506]  And while the white stag burns, see the public buy it.
[00:36:56.566 --> 00:36:59.048]  I see the profile, I see the media's compliance.
[00:36:59.248 --> 00:37:01.850]  Wars pay for business, see the vicious make a savior.
[00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:04.171]  Hope you understand the time, brothers cut the stage.
[00:37:04.532 --> 00:37:08.935]  What would you do if you knew all the things we do?
[00:37:20.213 --> 00:37:24.521]  Well, we haven't played all that at once in quite a long time, so there it is.
[00:37:32.039 --> 00:37:35.280]  We're going to watch a music video that Aaron Dykes put together with that.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.940]  That's the intro to our local TV show.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:52.605]  New season, by the way, is about to start back up, so we'll have more of those up on PrisonPlanet.tv, not just the in-studio video interviews, not just the out-in-the-field special reports, not just the Sunday show that we videotape and put on the web, but the TV show, the classic TV show as well.
[00:37:52.625 --> 00:38:00.827]  We've also been putting some of the older classic shows up on PrisonPlanet.tv from years ago that have never been seen on the web before.
[00:38:01.525 --> 00:38:08.351]  You know, I remember Paris emailed me back in 2002 about how he was inspired and woke up at 9-11.
[00:38:09.112 --> 00:38:12.735]  He'd already had suspicions about seeing 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny.
[00:38:12.935 --> 00:38:15.537]  And he also posted that on his website.
[00:38:15.938 --> 00:38:21.863]  And I've tried a few times to get a hold of him or even call his record place and they'd say he's kind of off their label right now.
[00:38:23.004 --> 00:38:23.785]  I can't get a hold of him.
[00:38:23.805 --> 00:38:26.347]  Maybe somebody else can because I want to have the guy on the radio show.
[00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:33.892]  That's classic, when somebody wants to contact you, you don't contact them because you're busy and then you can't get in contact with them.
[00:38:34.413 --> 00:38:40.995]  But just putting that shout out to everybody, I'd like to commission him to do some music for an upcoming film or something perhaps.
[00:38:42.216 --> 00:38:56.461]  Because I like Immortal Technique, folks, but I really think Paris isn't much... I think Paris is, I want to see better, but it's more to my liking, more to my type of genre, more to my audio palette, as they say.
[00:38:59.412 --> 00:39:02.154]  Alright, let me just get into this right now.
[00:39:02.174 --> 00:39:05.857]  I mean, I've been talking for 40 minutes and I've set the table for what we're about to get into.
[00:39:06.818 --> 00:39:16.306]  And this is so big, this is so bad, this is so out of control, that I want you to see it in context with everything else that's happening.
[00:39:18.108 --> 00:39:19.629]  The Philadelphia Daily News
[00:39:20.942 --> 00:39:30.307]  Ryder said 9-11 was a great thing that happened, but we need really another one to mobilize the people, and basically Americans are bad and slack-jawed and don't love the neocons and Bush enough.
[00:39:31.868 --> 00:39:33.809]  I mean, that shows you right there who's behind 9-11.
[00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:34.930]  Look who stands to gain.
[00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:37.111]  People who ask me, why would they want a 9-11?
[00:39:37.352 --> 00:39:40.213]  The neocons said before 9-11 they needed a 9-11.
[00:39:40.253 --> 00:39:44.336]  I mean, they explained to you why they need it.
[00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:46.797]  Stop acting like you don't understand why.
[00:39:47.651 --> 00:40:03.082]  Get into their mindset so they can set up a police state, have trillions in no-bid contracts, take over the government to take control of the wealth and use our military and our people and their tax money to wage a war for global domination.
[00:40:05.057 --> 00:40:17.744]  Now that's what Penak said, it's what Brzezinski said, it's what the top planners, from Kissinger to Brzezinski to David Rockefeller to Hillary Clinton, right down the line, both parties, they're one crew.
[00:40:22.926 --> 00:40:27.849]  Now, we've got a guest coming up, I'm just going to tell you they're in emergency management, pretty high level.
[00:40:28.969 --> 00:40:33.551]  And I don't want to spook the guests, because whenever we do that they end up not showing up to the show in the next hour.
[00:40:33.671 --> 00:40:41.813]  Then we've got an expert on some big new JFK developments coming up later in that hour, but I do want to open the phones up today specifically on this issue.
[00:40:46.315 --> 00:40:48.355]  But now it's gone from bad to worse.
[00:40:48.656 --> 00:40:53.357]  Neocons make Bush dictator of the world.
[00:40:54.097 --> 00:40:55.998]  This is on the heels of them announcing
[00:40:57.242 --> 00:41:02.584]  That they recruited 26,000 preachers to give sermons saying, lay down the government during martial law.
[00:41:02.944 --> 00:41:06.365]  I mean, folks, that is just, that is so un-American.
[00:41:07.105 --> 00:41:11.807]  And that, of course, Chertoff announcing yesterday, you're going to have to have domestic passports to travel.
[00:41:12.267 --> 00:41:15.488]  That's what Ron Paul told you three years ago about the REAL ID Act.
[00:41:16.149 --> 00:41:17.089]  Long before it passed.
[00:41:19.226 --> 00:41:27.551]  In January 15th of this year, to leave the country, it isn't just that you don't have an APB or a warrant out.
[00:41:28.111 --> 00:41:29.312]  They don't check a computer for that.
[00:41:30.712 --> 00:41:34.815]  Homeland Security has to give them authorization to let you leave or let you come back in.
[00:41:35.835 --> 00:41:37.456]  You ought to see it a few times I leave the country.
[00:41:37.496 --> 00:41:38.497]  I leave about once a year.
[00:41:38.517 --> 00:41:40.978]  When I come back in, they just stand back and look.
[00:41:41.478 --> 00:41:44.160]  They won't let me see the computer and act scared and say, go on through.
[00:41:45.303 --> 00:41:54.927]  I don't know what that designation is, but they act like they've just seen a 500-foot dragon with 19 heads, breathing acid and fire, with miniguns mounted on their heads, walking through.
[00:41:54.947 --> 00:41:58.088]  I mean, you'd think they'd just seen Beelzebub.
[00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:06.471]  Neocons make Bush dictator of the world.
[00:42:06.491 --> 00:42:10.353]  And I wouldn't even call them right-wing.
[00:42:10.373 --> 00:42:11.473]  They pose as the right.
[00:42:14.247 --> 00:42:37.114]  Maniacal right-wing Family Security Matters organization, which has ties to Cheney, and you get into it, it's not ties, it's run by him, Rumsfeld and Perl, Terry Screed that calls for Bush to declare martial law, this is one of their top people, he writes for the biggest publications out there, become emperor of the planet, lifetime president, and ethnically cleanse Iraq by means of nuclear genocide.
[00:42:39.334 --> 00:42:40.114]  You heard me right.
[00:42:41.055 --> 00:42:42.015]  If you thought Stu
[00:42:43.866 --> 00:42:47.489]  Blavatsky's call for a new 9-11 was the lowest the neocons could sink.
[00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:48.449]  Think again!
[00:42:48.469 --> 00:42:52.532]  And after they nuke the city, folks, they're gonna be heroes on television.
[00:42:53.273 --> 00:42:55.755]  Your neighbors will tear you apart if you don't submit.
[00:42:56.824 --> 00:43:10.091]  A right-wing foundation with links to Dick Cheney has called for Bush to be made lifetime president, ruler of the world, and for Iraq to be ethnically cleansed of Arabs by means of nuclear holocaust.
[00:43:10.111 --> 00:43:14.113]  Well, Cheney calls for bio-weapons in the September 2000 PENAC document.
[00:43:15.194 --> 00:43:28.447]  The Family Security Matters Organization, it's huge, masquerades as an independent think tank, yet was highly influential in President Bush's re-election in 2004, and has links to top neoconservative ideologues.
[00:43:29.167 --> 00:43:30.849]  It has links, it's run by.
[00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:39.277]  The outfit poses as an advocacy group for a new breed of goose-stepping brownshirts called Security Moms.
[00:43:40.436 --> 00:43:41.797]  And again, these people aren't Christians.
[00:43:41.817 --> 00:43:47.680]  They're a little social club, ninnying, cowardly, stupid, weak, demon-possessed people.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.360]  I've been around them.
[00:43:49.501 --> 00:43:51.021]  They are just radiating evil.
[00:43:52.002 --> 00:43:54.663]  They vaccinate their children, send them to public school, everything.
[00:43:55.183 --> 00:44:01.847]  The outfit poses as an advocacy group for a new breed of goose-stepping, brown-shirt, so-called security moms.
[00:44:04.048 --> 00:44:06.009]  I'd call them spiritual whores of the devil.
[00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:30.566]  The outfit poses as an advocacy group for a new breed of goose-stepping, brown-shirt, so-called security moms, or anti-Christ lapdogs, I would add, who are noted for their blind obedience to neoconservatism as a result of believing every ounce of fear-mongering that emanates from the Bush administration on the inevitability of mass casualty terror attacks.
[00:44:30.906 --> 00:44:33.808]  Remember what Hitler said, first you get the women,
[00:44:34.577 --> 00:44:37.298]  Then you've got the children.
[00:44:37.958 --> 00:44:39.858]  So follow the men.
[00:44:39.878 --> 00:44:59.463]  And that's why 80% plus of general advertising, not high ticket item, but general advertising, that is for soaps and textiles and food, entertainment items, is targeted at women because women make the majority of the purchases in the home.
[00:45:00.163 --> 00:45:03.224]  And men usually are busy, you know, off doing something or
[00:45:04.028 --> 00:45:06.731]  You know, looking at sports scores, it's always basically been that way.
[00:45:07.111 --> 00:45:08.693]  So women end up basically running things.
[00:45:08.713 --> 00:45:11.135]  You're just like, yeah, honey, sure, yeah, uh-huh, yeah.
[00:45:11.716 --> 00:45:14.519]  Well, that's why Hitler said, first you got the women.
[00:45:14.539 --> 00:45:18.603]  Again, first you get the women, then you got the children.
[00:45:18.623 --> 00:45:19.424]  That's an exact quote.
[00:45:20.265 --> 00:45:25.130]  First you get the women, then you've got the children.
[00:45:26.258 --> 00:45:28.080]  So follow the men.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.182]  And then they have these huge revivals of fake Christians.
[00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:40.690]  I've actually seen top evangelicals get up and say Christians aren't good, Israel is superior, and the Jews are above Christians and are going to heaven.
[00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:43.432]  Total blasphemy, by the way, if you've been going around the Bible.
[00:45:44.521 --> 00:45:51.042]  Uh, and that we must literally worship Israel, and it's mainly women just screaming for nuclear holocaust.
[00:45:51.523 --> 00:45:54.003]  Screaming, we're gonna make you come, Jesus!
[00:45:54.283 --> 00:45:56.263]  Fire the missiles now!
[00:45:57.084 --> 00:46:00.944]  I mean, oh man, they are, I mean, it's like the Handmaiden.
[00:46:03.005 --> 00:46:05.525]  Did you ever see that movie with, uh, Robert Duvall?
[00:46:05.545 --> 00:46:06.926]  I mean, that's basically what they are.
[00:46:07.506 --> 00:46:08.606]  And they're planning to take over.
[00:46:10.183 --> 00:46:16.605]  And all they care about is let them have their house, let them have their money, they're told the gravy train is going to continue as long as we nuke people.
[00:46:17.086 --> 00:46:19.867]  And then they're going to make Jesus do what they say.
[00:46:20.287 --> 00:46:22.328]  I mean, these are the ultimate cult members, folks.
[00:46:23.188 --> 00:46:39.234]  The outfit poses as an amnesty group for a new breed of goose-stepping brownshirts, the so-called security moms, who are noted for their blind obedience to neoconservatism as a result of believing every ounce of fear-mongering that emanates from the Bush administration on the inevitability of mass casualty terror attacks.
[00:46:39.773 --> 00:46:48.361]  In late 2004, Media Matters for America discovered that the phone number listed for SFM's website actually belonged to the Center for Security Policy.
[00:46:48.481 --> 00:46:49.482]  Of course it did!
[00:46:50.262 --> 00:46:59.991]  A rabidly hard-line foreign policy outfit run by former Reagan administration figure Frank Gaffney reports right web.
[00:47:01.272 --> 00:47:08.838]  The Center for Security Policy is an umbrella organization that includes the National Security Advisory Council, whose members hold senior positions in the Bush administration itself.
[00:47:09.198 --> 00:47:16.324]  Former current members include Dick Cheney, Richard Perle, Elliott Abrams, and the organization has also given awards to Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:47:16.704 --> 00:47:31.344]  The FSM Foundation itself also has ties to Anti-Defamation League, well of course it's Mossad, the International Women's Forum, numerous nationwide television and print media outlets, and includes on its board of directors, neocon radio host Laura Ingram, and former director of the U.S.
[00:47:31.364 --> 00:47:33.266]  Central Intelligence Agency, James Woolsey.
[00:47:33.567 --> 00:47:34.348]  They're on the board!
[00:47:35.072 --> 00:47:42.737]  James Woolsey, who you didn't see on Lou Dobbs, speaking out against the Al-Qaeda in America.
[00:47:42.837 --> 00:47:49.581]  Meanwhile, Lou, I guess, doesn't know that he was one of the chairmen up at the BAMF, SPP, North American Treason Meeting.
[00:47:50.421 --> 00:47:50.982]  Woolsey.
[00:47:51.442 --> 00:47:55.685]  That guy just radiates wickedness in his actions, and also just look at him.
[00:47:56.065 --> 00:47:58.726]  I mean, I wouldn't trust that guy with a dollar of my money.
[00:47:59.747 --> 00:48:01.288]  I wouldn't let him near my family.
[00:48:03.946 --> 00:48:06.028]  See, these guys cannot conceal their evil.
[00:48:06.068 --> 00:48:09.171]  They are literally reveling in their wickedness, and they just can't conceal it.
[00:48:09.831 --> 00:48:13.815]  Because his eyes burn with Stygian pits, and I'm serious when I say that.
[00:48:18.238 --> 00:48:28.287]  Representatives of SFM also routinely appear as guests on Fox News, and their website is a cesspool of anti-American fervor, acting as a cheerleader for the invasion of Iran, the warrantless wiretapping programs,
[00:48:29.162 --> 00:48:37.668]  Opponents are labeled as traitors, and lauds the Patriot Act as an irreplaceable tool utilized by the Secret Service to keep us safe.
[00:48:38.789 --> 00:48:52.718]  In an August 3rd article, contributing editor and philosopher Philip Atkinson penned a feverish diatribe that calls for the end of democracy, now that's his term, for Bush to be made ruler of the world as Julius Caesar made
[00:48:53.470 --> 00:49:02.445]  ...was made Roman Emperor for Bush to be made lifetime president in the US and for Iraq to be ethically cleansed by means of nuclear genocide and repopulated with Americans.
[00:49:04.156 --> 00:49:05.557]  That is exact Hitler, by the way.
[00:49:05.597 --> 00:49:06.338]  Lebenskraut.
[00:49:06.838 --> 00:49:07.499]  Living space.
[00:49:07.559 --> 00:49:17.527]  The comments are so fundamentally sick and twisted that the reader must absorb the following passages in full to recognize the true depravity of what the neocon friend truly embraced.
[00:49:17.947 --> 00:49:24.272]  After calling democracy the enemy of truth and justice, Atkinson openly calls for genocide and mass slaughter.
[00:49:24.693 --> 00:49:26.134]  And we have the article right here.
[00:49:26.294 --> 00:49:27.195]  It's unbelievable.
[00:49:28.035 --> 00:49:31.938]  He says we need to go ahead and nuke, go ahead and make Bush a world leader,
[00:49:33.668 --> 00:49:35.068]  And that it's of the Lord?
[00:49:36.849 --> 00:49:38.749]  The world leader is of the Lord.
[00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:40.009]  Okay!
[00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:47.431]  And folks, when the real devil, if you believe the Christian ideas, shows up, these people are going to fall right down.
[00:49:48.111 --> 00:49:49.731]  I mean, he could probably have a forked tail and they would.
[00:49:50.171 --> 00:49:52.312]  I mean, these are the ultimate scum.
[00:49:53.172 --> 00:49:55.492]  And of course, they're all CIA handled.
[00:49:55.552 --> 00:49:57.413]  I mean, they're not Christian at all.
[00:49:57.833 --> 00:49:59.473]  It's just the biggest joke in the world to them.
[00:50:02.452 --> 00:50:07.393]  The ADL is basically running the big mainline Christian churches now.
[00:50:07.473 --> 00:50:08.694]  I mean, they openly speak at them.
[00:50:09.154 --> 00:50:21.657]  And the ADL's the ones taking the Ten Commandments out, taking all the religious icons down from parks and crosses down, and it doesn't matter, they'll bring them right up on stage and, oh, it's of the Lord!
[00:50:22.277 --> 00:50:23.577]  Oh, yes!
[00:50:24.377 --> 00:50:25.538]  I mean, it's so sick!
[00:50:28.249 --> 00:50:33.913]  And you can go to PrisonPlanet.com and read what he actually said for himself.
[00:50:35.794 --> 00:50:40.277]  And they're now saying we need domestic passports to travel domestically in the U.S.
[00:50:41.337 --> 00:50:42.418]  This is Ron Paul Warren.
[00:50:42.438 --> 00:50:43.619]  We'll cover that when we get back.
[00:50:44.639 --> 00:50:47.841]  And we have a special guest coming up.
[00:50:49.022 --> 00:50:51.344]  This stuff cannot survive exposure though.
[00:50:51.744 --> 00:50:56.467]  If we expose it and show what it really is, they will fail.
[00:50:57.248 --> 00:50:59.049]  They will fail if you get the word out.
[00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:05.352]  It's here.
[00:51:05.532 --> 00:51:10.315]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.675 --> 00:51:18.299]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.996 --> 00:51:26.040]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:37.886]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.186 --> 00:51:42.109]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.149 --> 00:51:44.090]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:48.252]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.753 --> 00:52:04.935]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:04.955 --> 00:52:08.998]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:09.138 --> 00:52:11.700]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.101]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:14.282 --> 00:52:22.727]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:22.787 --> 00:52:24.108]  The brookie light is different.
[00:52:24.248 --> 00:52:28.251]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:28.251 --> 00:52:28.751]  We're good to go!
[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:51.702]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.
[00:52:51.722 --> 00:52:53.342]  888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:53.362 --> 00:52:54.323]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:01.643 --> 00:53:03.484]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:53:03.625 --> 00:53:08.808]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:53:08.988 --> 00:53:10.329]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:53:10.589 --> 00:53:18.774]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:53:18.994 --> 00:53:24.718]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:53:24.898 --> 00:53:26.659]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:53:26.739 --> 00:53:28.860]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:33.263]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:53:33.443 --> 00:53:35.624]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:53:35.684 --> 00:53:43.549]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:54:17.333 --> 00:54:29.556]  No exaggeration, I've got 20 plus, I counted them this morning, articles where they're recruiting children, adults, to quote, fight crime.
[00:54:29.636 --> 00:54:46.120]  See, first it's, we're going to have spies everywhere to fight terror, but now it's just fight crime, and now it's, but your intelligence agents, farmers, people in the cities, middle schoolers, where they have their own secret computer file and secret agent areas on the web.
[00:54:47.489 --> 00:54:50.071]  And they go and just write dossiers on your neighborhood.
[00:54:51.131 --> 00:54:58.035]  When they hired Marcus Wolfe, the former head of the Stasi, they meant business, folks.
[00:54:58.275 --> 00:54:58.976]  They meant business.
[00:55:00.496 --> 00:55:02.177]  And they're going for broke right now.
[00:55:02.337 --> 00:55:02.878]  I have that.
[00:55:02.938 --> 00:55:04.198]  But here is CNN.
[00:55:04.218 --> 00:55:04.639]  This is CNN.
[00:55:06.812 --> 00:55:23.899]  Federal ID plan raises privacy concerns and then the second line says this, Americans may need passports to board domestic flights or to picnic in a national park next year if they live in one of the states defying the Federal Real ID Act.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:26.040]  Now again,
[00:55:27.262 --> 00:55:30.824]  The majority of states already had federal standardization by the mid-nineties.
[00:55:30.864 --> 00:55:33.925]  Texas was the first, shamefully enough, adopted by 1994.
[00:55:34.406 --> 00:55:37.307]  That's in my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[00:55:38.267 --> 00:55:42.329]  And they go on to admit in here that to get on a domestic flight you have to have this.
[00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:48.632]  There's no law yet, see they've just been doing it, but now when it goes into effect next year it is in the law.
[00:55:50.673 --> 00:55:51.794]  Though it's unconstitutional.
[00:55:53.007 --> 00:56:00.650]  Now, remember, Homeland Security announced this year that illegal aliens did not have to have IDs, or accurate IDs, or could have consular matricula from their own country.
[00:56:02.031 --> 00:56:03.911]  They get housing and bank loans and car loans.
[00:56:04.632 --> 00:56:06.572]  And it said they will accept those for employment.
[00:56:06.933 --> 00:56:08.733]  So, see, it's not for them.
[00:56:08.793 --> 00:56:14.916]  You hear Chertoff everywhere saying this is to keep us safe, but there's no real security at the borders.
[00:56:14.976 --> 00:56:16.436]  This is an internal passport.
[00:56:16.856 --> 00:56:17.937]  Back when Ron Paul read,
[00:56:18.914 --> 00:56:22.556]  The Real ID Act 2004, they tried to pass it and they were able to in 2005.
[00:56:22.876 --> 00:56:24.717]  We had him on the show, we read the bill too.
[00:56:24.737 --> 00:56:26.118]  Remember his headline?
[00:56:26.538 --> 00:56:32.081]  He put it on the Liberty Committee that it would be a domestic internal passport to travel with internal checkpoints?
[00:56:32.481 --> 00:56:33.441]  Because it says it!
[00:56:34.922 --> 00:56:38.904]  And now they're giving the spy satellite data to the local police departments?
[00:56:39.444 --> 00:56:42.146]  Oh, that just so happen to have the uplinks built into them!
[00:56:43.357 --> 00:56:45.418]  And oh, they're telling the cops now about all the new features.
[00:56:45.478 --> 00:56:46.839]  Oh, there's a new feature this week.
[00:56:47.079 --> 00:56:49.060]  You can track everyone in the city on their cell phones.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.061]  And some cities are going, there's a new feature.
[00:56:51.101 --> 00:56:54.303]  You dial in this code and you can listen to Alex Jones' phone.
[00:56:55.524 --> 00:56:55.724]  See?
[00:56:55.744 --> 00:56:58.826]  Remember we told you all this years ago and now it's in the news.
[00:56:59.226 --> 00:57:04.289]  Because they had to pass the regulations and then the industry talked about it because it was such a big deal.
[00:57:04.709 --> 00:57:05.810]  But it was never on the news.
[00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:08.491]  Well, we got those industry publications.
[00:57:10.513 --> 00:57:11.973]  Everything is uploaded to them.
[00:57:12.554 --> 00:57:12.954]  Everything.
[00:57:13.513 --> 00:57:16.774]  Unless you're an illegal alien, it's all selectively not enforced.
[00:57:18.554 --> 00:57:22.076]  Hundreds of cities do arrest illegal aliens that can involve in felonies.
[00:57:22.116 --> 00:57:26.997]  I mean, rapes, stabbings, and they're released within days on average, and Homeland Security doesn't even pick them up.
[00:57:28.797 --> 00:57:35.739]  They gotta have that ongoing crisis to then say, oh, it's to, we need this REAL ID Act to stop illegal aliens.
[00:57:35.839 --> 00:57:40.861]  I remember Lamar Smith, when Texas in the early 1990s adopted the thumb scanning to get a driver's license,
[00:57:41.836 --> 00:57:44.417]  People were complaining, and he said, well, it's to stop the illegal aliens.
[00:57:44.497 --> 00:57:49.379]  But then, TxDOT put a waiver in where they didn't have to do it.
[00:57:50.139 --> 00:57:53.480]  And then cops don't even arrest them when they don't have driver's license.
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:59.902]  I mean, I laugh because... But put all this together.
[00:58:01.202 --> 00:58:09.205]  We now have Michael Chertoff, the head of Homeland Security, saying to the states, you're going to adopt the federal ID.
[00:58:10.532 --> 00:58:26.203]  You're under our control, and the citizens have to have their papers, or they can't get on a plane, domestically, to fly from, say, Dallas to Tucson, or Austin to New York, or New York to Boston.
[00:58:28.704 --> 00:58:29.485]  Now, is that freedom?
[00:58:31.086 --> 00:58:32.807]  And we all know it has nothing to do with security.
[00:58:34.228 --> 00:58:35.469]  You want to be a slave, folks?
[00:58:35.489 --> 00:58:38.131]  You're going to get to be one, unless we turn this around quick.
[00:58:41.801 --> 00:58:44.764]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:44.804 --> 00:58:45.064]  Big Brother.
[00:58:45.084 --> 00:58:46.025]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:46.045 --> 00:58:46.566]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:46.606 --> 00:58:47.006]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.574 --> 00:59:05.474]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.494 --> 00:59:09.796]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.316 --> 00:59:14.438]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:26.603]  Well, we have the gentleman who was featured in the newscast that we played here yesterday out of Louisiana.
[00:59:28.243 --> 00:59:31.366]  Where they are recruiting the pastors for during emergencies.
[00:59:32.046 --> 00:59:37.310]  I want to play that little two minute newscast again and we're going to go to our guest and have him for the next half hour.
[00:59:37.330 --> 00:59:40.233]  We really appreciate him joining us.
[00:59:40.273 --> 00:59:45.077]  Sandy Davis, Director of the Cato Bossier Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness.
[00:59:45.377 --> 00:59:46.318]  Here's that news piece.
[00:59:46.998 --> 00:59:49.479]  Law ever become a reality in America?
[00:59:49.879 --> 00:59:54.200]  Some fear any nuclear, biological, or chemical attack on U.S.
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.301]  territory might trigger just that.
[00:59:56.801 --> 01:00:03.763]  NFK's Late News 12's Jeff Beryl discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[01:00:04.064 --> 01:00:07.145]  From my cold, dead hand!
[01:00:07.305 --> 01:00:14.547]  Charlton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American value, the overarching desire to protect our freedoms.
[01:00:15.228 --> 01:00:21.492]  But gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
[01:00:22.172 --> 01:00:22.472]  U.S.
[01:00:22.512 --> 01:00:23.673]  troops also arrived.
[01:00:24.013 --> 01:00:30.757]  Something far easier to do even now thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act.
[01:00:31.237 --> 01:00:32.338]  That forbid U.S.
[01:00:32.398 --> 01:00:34.419]  troops from policing on American soil.
[01:00:36.676 --> 01:00:43.802]  If martial law were enacted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege, easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[01:00:44.302 --> 01:00:50.167]  And that's exactly what the Clergy Response Team, as it's called, helped accomplish in New Orleans.
[01:00:50.187 --> 01:00:56.512]  The primary thing that we say to anybody is, let's cooperate and get this thing over with, and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[01:00:56.772 --> 01:01:00.895]  Such Clergy Response Teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government,
[01:01:01.315 --> 01:01:02.677]  Versus the wishes of the public.
[01:01:03.177 --> 01:01:09.904]  In a lot of cases these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're helping to diffuse that situation.
[01:01:10.304 --> 01:01:17.692]  For the clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public down or obey the law is the Bible itself.
[01:01:18.132 --> 01:01:19.573]  Specifically, Romans.
[01:01:20.074 --> 01:01:20.434]  Romans 13.
[01:01:20.494 --> 01:01:22.937]  Because the government's established all the law.
[01:01:23.752 --> 01:01:24.052]  You know?
[01:01:24.352 --> 01:01:26.014]  And that's what we believe in the Christian faith.
[01:01:26.034 --> 01:01:27.234]  That's what's stated in the scripture.
[01:01:27.855 --> 01:01:36.680]  Civil rights advocates believe the amount of public cooperation may depend largely on how long they expect the suspension of their rights might last.
[01:01:37.701 --> 01:01:39.342]  Jeff Carroll, KSLA News 12 reporting.
[01:01:40.183 --> 01:01:47.587]  According to Tuberville, during Hurricane Katrina, the clergy response team provided 38 chaplains a day, around the clock, at eight different camps.
[01:01:48.668 --> 01:01:52.951]  Okay, so Sandy Davis is a regional director based out of Shreveport, Louisiana.
[01:01:53.815 --> 01:01:54.236]  Yes, we are.
[01:02:04.193 --> 01:02:06.053]  You're absolutely welcome.
[01:02:26.067 --> 01:02:27.168]  We're going to break here in just a minute.
[01:02:27.188 --> 01:02:28.108]  This is our news segment.
[01:02:28.128 --> 01:02:37.092]  We're going to come right back after the break, but I specifically want to talk about this program because we've now learned of it and we're seeing that it's actually going on around the country.
[01:02:38.433 --> 01:02:38.833]  Absolutely.
[01:02:38.873 --> 01:02:48.757]  We realized years ago, and of course, be it in the Bible Belt that we're in here in North Louisiana, we realized years ago how important it was to incorporate that faith-based community in any emergency response.
[01:02:49.878 --> 01:02:53.059]  So that's been going on for, I mean, how old is this specific program?
[01:02:55.698 --> 01:02:59.320]  Probably at least 10 or 12 years we've been using it here in the Caddo-Bossier area.
[01:03:00.661 --> 01:03:02.842]  So this has been going on for a long time?
[01:03:03.262 --> 01:03:08.165]  Yes, it started off with Darrell Tuberville who was also featured in that news release.
[01:03:08.805 --> 01:03:11.146]  He was the chaplain for the 345 fire department.
[01:03:11.186 --> 01:03:14.668]  He now has his doctorate and has moved on into private practice.
[01:03:15.409 --> 01:03:19.431]  He has basically coordinated that and it started from critical incident stress management.
[01:03:20.647 --> 01:03:21.407]  Well, sure.
[01:03:21.467 --> 01:03:26.991]  I mean, there's always been chaplains hitting the beaches of Normandy.
[01:03:34.671 --> 01:03:35.272]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:03:54.148 --> 01:03:59.113]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[01:03:59.413 --> 01:04:04.858]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:04:04.898 --> 01:04:09.202]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[01:04:09.542 --> 01:04:12.545]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:04:12.865 --> 01:04:16.288]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[01:04:16.608 --> 01:04:25.978]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Perky's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:04:26.238 --> 01:04:29.742]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:04:29.982 --> 01:04:37.070]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:38.691]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.00.

[01:04:56.434 --> 01:05:01.900]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:02.261 --> 01:05:09.889]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:17.643]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:18.063 --> 01:05:29.468]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.788 --> 01:05:33.730]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:35.711]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:36.011 --> 01:05:39.853]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:53.237 --> 01:05:55.618]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[01:05:56.159 --> 01:05:57.620]  After a pedicure they look great.
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:01.802]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[01:06:02.242 --> 01:06:04.444]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[01:06:04.864 --> 01:06:08.206]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:06:08.606 --> 01:06:11.068]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:06:11.568 --> 01:06:12.608]  What's that name again?
[01:06:13.009 --> 01:06:14.189]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:15.730]  It's CalX.
[01:06:16.151 --> 01:06:17.992]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:06:18.352 --> 01:06:20.193]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[01:06:20.962 --> 01:06:29.584]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:06:30.024 --> 01:06:35.726]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:06:36.126 --> 01:06:47.269]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:06:47.927 --> 01:06:49.008]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[01:06:49.348 --> 01:06:50.008]  I'll be right back.
[01:06:50.128 --> 01:06:51.869]  I'm getting some Kallax for my heels.
[01:06:54.531 --> 01:06:56.732]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:57.293 --> 01:07:00.094]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:11.724 --> 01:07:13.686]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:07:13.726 --> 01:07:14.547]  until 2 p.m.
[01:07:14.587 --> 01:07:15.668]  We're here live.
[01:07:15.688 --> 01:07:25.778]  If you have any questions for our guest, you can go up to the message board up on prisonplanet.com and you can post some questions there and I can bring them up to our guest.
[01:07:26.979 --> 01:07:29.061]  He's a retired career fire service professional.
[01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:32.491]  And he's been involved in all sorts of emergency management.
[01:07:32.511 --> 01:07:34.011]  He's based in Shreveport, Louisiana.
[01:07:34.031 --> 01:07:39.572]  He's the emergency manager for the surrounding areas there with local Homeland Security.
[01:07:39.593 --> 01:07:46.054]  And he was in the newscast that we just played on a local television where they talked about martial law.
[01:07:46.274 --> 01:07:50.555]  And we did see that during what happened with Katrina.
[01:07:50.915 --> 01:07:52.976]  They did go into high and dry areas.
[01:07:53.866 --> 01:07:54.587]  Take Guns.
[01:07:54.627 --> 01:07:56.408]  That was on ABC National News.
[01:07:56.548 --> 01:08:00.431]  Bob Woodward even covered that.
[01:08:01.271 --> 01:08:06.735]  But specifically we're talking about the clergy being involved in all this.
[01:08:06.755 --> 01:08:13.419]  And again, you've always had different chaplains and others on ships of war.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.942]  And in every war we've been in, there were chaplains on both sides of the Revolutionary War.
[01:08:18.135 --> 01:08:30.545]  I think the difference here, Mr. Davis, is that they've been recruited to, quote, quell and calm people during emergencies.
[01:08:31.005 --> 01:08:33.968]  Can you specifically speak to that role?
[01:08:34.528 --> 01:08:41.534]  Well, I think that we may have exaggerated that role a little bit in that news story, if that's fair.
[01:08:43.916 --> 01:08:46.378]  The chaplain program is designed
[01:08:47.073 --> 01:08:47.613]  I think.
[01:09:05.426 --> 01:09:16.010]  And perhaps have pre-established relationships with those civilian population that perhaps the first responders have not established, if that makes sense.
[01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:32.675]  Well, let me raise this to you because a year ago I was contacted by several preachers, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and I was given documents and they were told this is a secret program and that they were recruited in to even give sermons getting people ready in case martial law
[01:09:36.716 --> 01:09:37.657]  I certainly have not.
[01:09:39.157 --> 01:09:44.139]  I know that of course you don't want to stay in Louisiana and we spend all our time in the pulpits trying to get people elected, you know?
[01:09:45.419 --> 01:09:46.339]  I'm kidding about that.
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:50.121]  No, I have not heard about such a program.
[01:09:50.181 --> 01:09:52.581]  Now, would it surprise me?
[01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:54.222]  It wouldn't surprise me if there are some
[01:09:55.207 --> 01:10:01.309]  Perhaps some areas of the country where they're doing that, but I'm not aware of a formal program that we have that would do that.
[01:10:01.909 --> 01:10:14.933]  But this program that you have, I mean, there are preachers on the newscast saying that we're Romans 13 and we go tell people to submit to the civil authority and let's all argue about this after the emergency.
[01:10:14.993 --> 01:10:17.474]  I mean, they're not exaggerating, are they?
[01:10:21.986 --> 01:10:26.613]  I'm embarrassed to tell you that even though I was on the newscast I didn't see the whole thing.
[01:10:26.633 --> 01:10:29.237]  I don't really know what context they were...
[01:10:30.090 --> 01:10:32.352]  I just happen to have my Bible in front of me here.
[01:10:32.372 --> 01:10:35.114]  I'm going to turn to Romans 13 so I know what we're talking about.
[01:10:35.275 --> 01:10:41.640]  Well, would you like me... Well, Romans 13 is... You know, Jesus was killed for not following the civil and religious government.
[01:10:42.781 --> 01:10:44.822]  Most of the disciples were killed for that.
[01:10:45.102 --> 01:10:48.946]  Hitler's favorite verse was Romans 13 about submitting to government.
[01:10:48.966 --> 01:10:54.290]  Of course, it means submit to godly government, not submit to Adolf Hitler.
[01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:55.591]  Right, exactly.
[01:10:56.393 --> 01:10:56.834]  Exactly.
[01:10:58.157 --> 01:11:04.172]  I'm surprised that this clergy program has taken that twist, to be quite honest with you.
[01:11:04.989 --> 01:11:06.089]  Well, let me be honest with you.
[01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:10.010]  You sound like a nice fella, and I know that there's good people in emergency management everywhere.
[01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:16.532]  I remember Thomas Sanchez in Kingsville, Texas, back when the Chief of Police in San Antonio threw the Delta Force out in 99.
[01:11:16.572 --> 01:11:18.072]  You can just Google that and find it.
[01:11:18.092 --> 01:11:22.313]  And I went down and interviewed him, and he talked about seeing PDD 25 and things like that.
[01:11:22.533 --> 01:11:28.215]  Have you heard about the John Warner Defense Authorization Act and how that federalized the National Guard completely?
[01:11:28.715 --> 01:11:29.075]  Yes.
[01:11:30.655 --> 01:11:31.996]  So you are aware of these changes?
[01:11:33.396 --> 01:11:33.836]  Absolutely.
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:39.063]  And I'm trying to pull it up right now as we talk.
[01:11:40.724 --> 01:11:46.929]  As you well know, I've got kind of short notice to be your guest here today and I want to be sure that I'm talking intelligently about the issue.
[01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:55.872]  We know that all over the country they recruited 26,000 preachers.
[01:11:56.913 --> 01:12:04.478]  And we got the documents that said, get people ready for forced inoculations, for gun confiscation and relocation to camps, including the split up of families.
[01:12:04.498 --> 01:12:07.420]  And if you'd like, I can get you those hundreds of pages of documents.
[01:12:09.382 --> 01:12:11.703]  But in this program, you're not aware of anything like that?
[01:12:12.264 --> 01:12:12.584]  No, sir.
[01:12:14.005 --> 01:12:14.365]  No, sir.
[01:12:14.405 --> 01:12:22.311]  That was not the original intent of the clergy response program in Kettle and Bossier Parishes.
[01:12:23.223 --> 01:12:27.467]  Now, we typed in this clergy response program and found it all over the country.
[01:12:27.767 --> 01:12:34.192]  Was this, I understand you already had one there, but was this germinated by the feds, or who founded this, who runs this?
[01:12:34.792 --> 01:12:44.220]  Well, Darrell Tuberville, who was also in that news piece, was the catalyst for putting together this clergy response.
[01:12:44.804 --> 01:12:45.325]  No, I'm not sure.
[01:12:45.385 --> 01:12:47.546]  He's got his doctorate in family counseling from some university here in Louisiana.
[01:13:04.165 --> 01:13:07.467]  Let me just say this.
[01:13:08.608 --> 01:13:12.070]  I mean certainly we were all raised in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.
[01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:17.914]  They used the state churches with the preachers to spy on the people and to tell them to submit.
[01:13:18.194 --> 01:13:25.159]  And so that's why, I mean you heard that newscast talk of preachers and camps and everything else.
[01:13:29.876 --> 01:13:37.678]  Here again, I'm of the opinion that that news story may have sensationalized what the intent of his clergy response was.
[01:13:37.939 --> 01:13:38.679]  Well, here's the problem.
[01:13:38.759 --> 01:13:41.720]  Congress isn't allowed to see the new Emergency Management Plan.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.861]  They've always been able to before, and they're supposedly co-equal to the Executive Show.
[01:13:45.881 --> 01:13:53.403]  The Homeland Security Committee's upset right now, and a lot of top people in both parties are saying, well, I mean, a top Republican
[01:13:54.389 --> 01:13:55.750]  Let me just pull the article out here.
[01:13:56.471 --> 01:14:06.018]  Just called for Bush to be made dictator and Chertoff told CNN yesterday that we may have to have passports to travel inside the U.S.
[01:14:07.999 --> 01:14:12.443]  Man, I hope and pray we never come to that.
[01:14:15.025 --> 01:14:17.066]  I'm dumbfounded by that statement.
[01:14:17.106 --> 01:14:19.568]  Why can't they just profile the illegal aliens in people?
[01:14:22.743 --> 01:14:28.568]  Every, having come from a governmental agency for my entire adult life, that's always been my argument.
[01:14:28.608 --> 01:14:35.294]  Why do we blanket the entire organization when there's one person creating the problem, you know?
[01:14:37.336 --> 01:14:41.940]  Unless the target is just basically getting a handle and control over the public themselves.
[01:14:45.751 --> 01:14:48.394]  Yeah, I'll go along with you on that.
[01:14:48.414 --> 01:14:49.515]  That's what their intent is.
[01:14:50.056 --> 01:14:55.963]  Sure, I mean by profiling, I don't mean just go out and start grabbing anybody who looks like they're Arabic or looks like they're Mexican.
[01:14:56.123 --> 01:15:00.728]  I mean go to the day labor site and you see a hundred guys in cowboy hats, they're illegal aliens.
[01:15:02.463 --> 01:15:04.845]  And then go up and you've got probable cause, and then you've got them.
[01:15:05.226 --> 01:15:06.207]  I mean, that's my point.
[01:15:06.247 --> 01:15:12.532]  I've pulled up to checkpoints on I-35 and had police want to search my car, and I'm going, you know, what are you doing this for?
[01:15:12.572 --> 01:15:15.634]  There's literally illegal aliens running around everywhere.
[01:15:16.235 --> 01:15:16.475]  Right.
[01:15:19.818 --> 01:15:20.818]  So that's my only point.
[01:15:21.739 --> 01:15:26.183]  How many pastors in your geographic area, how many counties are you over?
[01:15:26.924 --> 01:15:38.117]  Well, we have parishes, of course, rather than counties, but I'm responsible for Caddo and Bossier parishes, and then there are seven parishes in northwest Louisiana, which I have coordination responsibility for.
[01:15:38.137 --> 01:15:41.461]  It doesn't pay anything extra, just more work.
[01:15:42.463 --> 01:15:46.988]  One of those things where the rural parishes don't have the assets that we have in the metropolitan area.
[01:15:47.745 --> 01:16:00.198]  And in that area we've probably got, I don't know factually, but I'm guessing we've got somewhere in the neighborhood of about 40 pastors that participate in this clergy response program.
[01:16:02.276 --> 01:16:07.179]  Well, I'm going to send you information on the national program because it was secret.
[01:16:07.239 --> 01:16:10.762]  I mean, when they first did this, they recruited me and said, this is secret.
[01:16:11.182 --> 01:16:18.127]  And then we actually got the documents, and Homeland Security got so upset, they actually tracked back where this guy worked and fired him from the hospital.
[01:16:18.427 --> 01:16:19.467]  He still has his church.
[01:16:20.268 --> 01:16:27.213]  But this is a secret program, and what that newscast reported mirrors what we heard about the secret program.
[01:16:29.873 --> 01:16:35.578]  Embarrassed to say that I have no knowledge of that program at all.
[01:16:36.278 --> 01:16:41.322]  If that's the case, I'm shocked and disappointed that that is what has happened.
[01:16:41.422 --> 01:16:54.072]  I'm going to try to contact Darrell, who heads that up, and see if... Would you want to get him on there?
[01:16:54.881 --> 01:16:55.742]  We tried to get him on.
[01:16:55.762 --> 01:16:56.962]  We've been calling since yesterday.
[01:16:57.002 --> 01:16:58.323]  We were only able to get through to you.
[01:16:58.383 --> 01:17:00.244]  You're the only guy that answers his telephone.
[01:17:00.264 --> 01:17:03.146]  We called the two preachers in the newscast.
[01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:09.289]  We googled the name and the parishes and found a whole bunch of names, more than a dozen.
[01:17:09.569 --> 01:17:11.350]  We've called six or seven of those.
[01:17:12.151 --> 01:17:15.813]  And all the secretaries are real sweet and giggle and say they're out.
[01:17:16.253 --> 01:17:18.094]  I guess they're just there on Sunday and Wednesday nights.
[01:17:18.314 --> 01:17:23.316]  Yeah, let me tell you what, during the next break, I will call Darrell.
[01:17:23.336 --> 01:17:27.497]  I got that super secret squirrel number for him.
[01:17:27.537 --> 01:17:28.817]  Good, good, yeah.
[01:17:28.837 --> 01:17:30.258]  And I'll see if I can get him on.
[01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:32.099]  You got the shell phone number when he's out on the bass boat.
[01:17:32.359 --> 01:17:32.939]  There you go.
[01:17:32.959 --> 01:17:35.080]  You know where the preachers are, you know.
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:39.121]  He's probably got a big Parson engine Cadillac, too.
[01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:41.382]  No, he's a good guy, really.
[01:17:41.462 --> 01:17:42.262]  That's why I'm shocked.
[01:17:42.502 --> 01:17:44.002]  That's really and truly why I'm shocked.
[01:17:46.023 --> 01:17:50.545]  That clergy response has taken that twist if that in fact is the case.
[01:18:00.592 --> 01:18:19.492]  It's just that this ended up being in some Ohio and Pennsylvania papers, and I'm looking at the article, Secret FEMA Plan to Use Pastors as Pacifiers in Preparation for Martial Law, Nationwide Initiative trains volunteers to teach congregations to obey the government during seizures of guns, property, forced inoculations, and forced relocation.
[01:18:20.433 --> 01:18:21.614]  And we have hundreds of pages.
[01:18:22.934 --> 01:18:27.095]  And then he was scared to death, the first preacher we talked to, and said, please don't, don't, you know.
[01:18:27.395 --> 01:18:29.416]  And then they found out where he faxed it from.
[01:18:29.456 --> 01:18:30.516]  He didn't fax it from his church.
[01:18:30.876 --> 01:18:33.497]  He faxed it from a store.
[01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:37.037]  They went back and tracked where it was from and then went after him for it.
[01:18:37.438 --> 01:18:44.999]  That's how secret, and I'm sure you've heard about PDD 51, where Bush now announced that he's above the Congress.
[01:18:45.699 --> 01:18:46.540]  We'll be right back, sir.
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.000]  You've got three minutes to make that phone call.
[01:18:54.284 --> 01:18:58.885]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.

[01:19:50.984 --> 01:19:52.885]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:56.087 --> 01:19:57.348]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:57.708 --> 01:19:59.749]  Here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:20:00.930 --> 01:20:05.753]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:20:05.953 --> 01:20:08.695]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:20:08.735 --> 01:20:09.855]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:20:11.196 --> 01:20:15.739]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:20:16.710 --> 01:20:23.974]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:20:24.954 --> 01:20:28.376]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:20:28.936 --> 01:20:33.618]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[01:20:34.619 --> 01:20:35.879]  Call for your copy today.
[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:38.781]  It's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:39.401 --> 01:20:45.244]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:20:45.934 --> 01:20:46.335]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:46.375 --> 01:20:46.575]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.358 --> 01:20:56.059]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:20:56.239 --> 01:20:57.479]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:20:57.719 --> 01:21:00.541]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:21:00.921 --> 01:21:03.682]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:21:04.222 --> 01:21:10.965]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:21:11.505 --> 01:21:19.109]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers, from humorous to serious, at LibertyStickers.com.
[01:21:20.109 --> 01:21:21.391]  We're good to go.
[01:21:34.906 --> 01:21:35.126]  Call 877-873-9626.
[01:21:35.186 --> 01:21:35.547]  That's 877-873-9626.

[01:21:37.849 --> 01:21:38.529]  Call 877-873-9626.
[01:21:38.549 --> 01:21:38.809]  That's 877-873-9626.
[01:21:38.829 --> 01:21:40.131]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:40.171 --> 01:21:42.613]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:16.906]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny?
[01:22:17.866 --> 01:22:23.068]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[01:22:23.897 --> 01:22:31.843]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:32.843 --> 01:22:33.364]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:33.384 --> 01:22:33.704]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:33.744 --> 01:22:35.125]  The call is free.
[01:22:35.145 --> 01:22:39.508]  Our operators are standing by to take your order for a year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:53.729 --> 01:23:13.357]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss, another... Well, he's a really nice fella.
[01:23:13.998 --> 01:23:21.481]  You know, when we get these guys on and they don't seem legitimate, we yell and scream at them, but... I haven't met a lot of firefighters I don't like.
[01:23:22.262 --> 01:23:24.724]  Because they really are real public servants.
[01:23:25.684 --> 01:23:28.346]  And we really appreciate him coming on the show today with us.
[01:23:28.966 --> 01:23:34.350]  Sandy Davis, he's the Emergency Management Director for, what, nine counties total.
[01:23:35.271 --> 01:23:46.418]  And they're in the Caddo and Bossier, his main counties, up in Shreveport, here right on the Texas-Texas-Louisiana border area.
[01:23:47.805 --> 01:23:51.748]  And were you able to talk to the pastor who's heading up this whole program during the break?
[01:23:52.068 --> 01:23:55.970]  I've got his answering service, which is probably worth the same thing you've got.
[01:23:56.871 --> 01:23:59.733]  I'll tell you what I'd like to do, Alex.
[01:24:01.394 --> 01:24:05.836]  I guess I've been kind of caught off and unaware of this whole situation.
[01:24:07.239 --> 01:24:12.583]  I'm embarrassed not to be any more knowledgeable of it than I am, but I am going to do some research on it over the next couple of days.
[01:24:12.683 --> 01:24:18.868]  Well, I've got a sneaking suspicion that this is going to be the federal deal, and that so much is going on.
[01:24:18.929 --> 01:24:32.840]  I mean, I don't even know what's going on in my own life half the time, so it's not bad that you're not aware specifically where it came from, because the name is the same, the whole operating MO is the same, and I frankly think you're going to find that that newscast didn't exaggerate as much as you thought.
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.581]  Yeah, well perhaps not.
[01:24:35.882 --> 01:24:44.586]  But I know this, that personally and professionally I would not support that kind of operation.
[01:24:45.667 --> 01:24:52.811]  And if I have been guilty of supporting that unaware, then shame on me.
[01:24:54.252 --> 01:24:54.513]  That's right.
[01:25:04.762 --> 01:25:10.184]  And then perhaps be able to come back on sometime early next week and maybe discuss it a little more intelligently.
[01:25:10.204 --> 01:25:12.905]  Sure, next Monday we'll call you and see if you want to come on Monday or Tuesday.
[01:25:12.925 --> 01:25:17.146]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:25:17.366 --> 01:25:20.327]  We'll just call you Monday and then you can do it at your convenience.
[01:25:20.347 --> 01:25:22.808]  I'll just have Trey, my producer, call you sir on Monday.
[01:25:23.108 --> 01:25:28.709]  And listen, I really appreciate your openness and your honesty and you sound like a good constitutionalist to me.
[01:25:29.610 --> 01:25:33.851]  But at the same time, I would ask those preachers to see their specific handbooks.
[01:25:34.271 --> 01:25:37.712]  Because let me tell you, this is the exact same name and same M.O.
[01:25:37.772 --> 01:25:38.572]  as the federal deal.
[01:25:39.332 --> 01:25:52.515]  Well, I just, you know, like I say, I know that the initial purpose of this was not to take control of the civilian population during times of disaster.
[01:25:52.955 --> 01:26:03.597]  That it was strictly to support those emergency responders and their mental and physical well-being during response to disasters and to help
[01:26:04.722 --> 01:26:08.707]  Well, that's why they've had the clergy for a thousand years during problems.
[01:26:08.727 --> 01:26:12.032]  But see, that's why it's perfect for the feds to come in and take over that role.
[01:26:12.472 --> 01:26:14.716]  Sure, and I can certainly understand that.
[01:26:14.956 --> 01:26:18.801]  I mean, if I was going to find somebody to try to convince one of my family members to
[01:26:19.881 --> 01:26:22.644]  I'll make you this promise that I will research the local
[01:26:44.938 --> 01:26:52.860]  clergy response and find out and be just as open and honest with you about what I find out as I have been about my ignorance of it today.
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:27:01.822]  Okay, well listen, it really is refreshing to talk to a public servant like yourself, Sandy Davis, and we'll talk to you next week, sir, and we appreciate your time.
[01:27:01.882 --> 01:27:02.122]  Okay.
[01:27:02.502 --> 01:27:02.982]  Okay, Alex.
[01:27:03.142 --> 01:27:03.422]  Take care.
[01:27:03.743 --> 01:27:04.123]  Take care.
[01:27:04.643 --> 01:27:13.145]  Now, again, ladies and gentlemen, I get a lot of these bureaucrats on, they're arrogant, they're haughty, they're full of themselves, they're deceptive, and
[01:27:15.228 --> 01:27:23.054]  That fellow just doesn't know what's going on, because he's a firefighter, and he's busy really trying to prepare for emergencies and hurricanes and things.
[01:27:23.814 --> 01:27:27.777]  Meanwhile, he's got preachers who, again, rode to hell, paid with good intentions.
[01:27:28.738 --> 01:27:34.462]  A lot of these preachers believe Romans 13, but there's no spinning what you heard that preacher say.
[01:27:35.623 --> 01:27:37.084]  There is no spinning.
[01:27:37.879 --> 01:27:47.003]  The fact that they were, submit to government, do what they say, get ready for martial law, and that the handbooks are turn your guns in and go to the FEMA camp and do all of this.
[01:27:47.103 --> 01:27:49.384]  But, it makes you feel a little better.
[01:27:49.404 --> 01:27:50.645]  And as I've said,
[01:27:51.306 --> 01:27:53.468]  The Feds can claim they're going to take something over.
[01:27:53.808 --> 01:27:55.750]  They can claim they're going to be able to enforce something.
[01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:58.072]  They can claim they're going to get their martial law.
[01:27:58.612 --> 01:28:15.406]  But when push comes to shove in Idaho, and Indiana, and Illinois, and Louisiana, and Texas, and Alabama, and New Mexico, and Northern California, and Oklahoma, and Georgia, and Virginia, and Maine, and Rhode Island.
[01:28:16.287 --> 01:28:17.988]  I mean, we ought to add to all this.
[01:28:18.048 --> 01:28:19.069]  Remember two, three years ago?
[01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:24.053]  The governor tried to declare martial law in Rhode Island and say you couldn't criticize the government or you'd be arrested?
[01:28:24.073 --> 01:28:25.053]  I mean, that was in the paper!
[01:28:25.493 --> 01:28:28.375]  And hundreds of people showed up to protest that day and he apologized.
[01:28:29.075 --> 01:28:33.798]  And see, they're seeing what they can get away with, they're probing, they're pushing.
[01:28:34.258 --> 01:28:36.400]  And a big terror attack could carry them through.
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:40.142]  That's the only way they could get away with declaring this, and that's why they made Stage 1.
[01:28:44.244 --> 01:28:45.185]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.625 --> 01:28:47.146]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.144 --> 01:28:50.885]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.307 --> 01:28:56.808]  Do you know that you can go solar for under 1200 bucks now?
[01:28:57.328 --> 01:28:58.448]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[01:28:58.648 --> 01:29:02.810]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:08.292]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[01:29:08.792 --> 01:29:15.235]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[01:29:15.974 --> 01:29:18.656]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[01:29:18.816 --> 01:29:28.804]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak converter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[01:29:29.064 --> 01:29:32.787]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[01:29:32.827 --> 01:29:39.332]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[01:29:39.512 --> 01:29:40.553]  Are you ready to go solar?

[01:30:18.886 --> 01:30:24.127]  It has real ingredients that have been shown to reduce the signs of aging and fight natural sun damage.

[01:30:58.308 --> 01:31:02.552]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:31:02.972 --> 01:31:09.817]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:10.257 --> 01:31:16.960]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:18.901]  There are no reported side effects.

[01:31:46.152 --> 01:31:51.454]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[01:31:52.775 --> 01:32:00.378]  I heard from Frank that LBJ had designated Gordon Meyer Jr.
[01:32:01.158 --> 01:32:07.221]  to undertake a larger organization while keeping it totally secret.
[01:32:07.995 --> 01:32:17.318]  Cordbar himself was a rather favored member of the Eastern aristocracy.
[01:32:17.338 --> 01:32:29.882]  He was a graduate of Yale University and had joined the Marine Corps during the war and lost an eye in the Pacific fighting.
[01:32:31.130 --> 01:32:56.114]  I think that LBJ settled on Meyer as an opportunist parent like himself a parent and a man who had very little left to him in life ever since JFK had taken Korg's wife as one of his mistresses.
[01:32:57.075 --> 01:32:58.615]  I would suggest that
[01:32:59.591 --> 01:33:08.155]  Kord Meier welcomed the approach from LBJ who was, after all, only the Vice President at that time.
[01:33:08.175 --> 01:33:15.898]  And, of course, could not number Kord Meier among JFK's admirers.
[01:33:16.398 --> 01:33:17.679]  Quite the contrary.
[01:33:18.439 --> 01:33:19.560]  As for Dave Phillips,
[01:33:20.425 --> 01:33:23.171]  I knew him pretty well at one time.
[01:33:23.993 --> 01:33:28.763]  He worked for me during the Guatemala project.
[01:33:29.043 --> 01:33:31.488]  He made himself useful to the agency.
[01:33:32.176 --> 01:33:33.477]  That's E. Howard Hunt.
[01:33:33.897 --> 01:33:39.521]  When he thought he was going to die three years ago, he deathbed confessioned how he ran the operation to kill JFK.
[01:33:40.002 --> 01:33:44.145]  As high up as his command structure went with President LBJ, we know it went above that.
[01:33:44.545 --> 01:33:49.809]  There's been attempts by people in our, quote, community to claim that I'm saying it went only to LBJ.
[01:33:49.889 --> 01:33:53.591]  No, the man who was ordered to kill him got his orders from LBJ.
[01:33:53.912 --> 01:33:57.254]  That's what we reported here, not what was misrepresented, as usual.
[01:33:59.035 --> 01:34:10.959]  We are joined by Paul Kunstler here in just a few minutes, who has run a major media operation there in D.C.
[01:34:10.979 --> 01:34:12.079]  for quite a while.
[01:34:14.119 --> 01:34:15.820]  He's not a rich man.
[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:22.502]  He spent $196,000 of his own money, much of his money, to put a full page ad in the front section of the New York Times.
[01:34:23.630 --> 01:34:35.675]  And that type of action has to be respected to get out the new declassified info, which again just adds to the pile of open and shut case the military-industrial complex had JFK killed.
[01:34:35.715 --> 01:34:38.536]  So Arthur Kunstler will be joining us here in about two minutes.
[01:34:38.897 --> 01:34:40.077]  I want to tell you about a new sponsor.
[01:34:41.998 --> 01:34:48.981]  Now you've already heard about them here on the show because they put on huge events, co-sponsored events at UT that I've spoke at, that a thousand people have attended.
[01:34:49.949 --> 01:34:52.132]  They are one of the best bookstores I've ever been in.
[01:34:52.192 --> 01:34:53.274]  In fact, probably the best.
[01:34:53.695 --> 01:34:54.657]  Thousands of books.
[01:34:55.157 --> 01:34:56.419]  Thousands of videos.
[01:34:56.439 --> 01:34:58.543]  I mean, they've got stuff I've never heard of or seen.
[01:34:59.044 --> 01:35:00.687]  Incredible information.
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:13.006]  9-11 Truth, Alternative Medicine, The World's Banking Powers, Suppressed Sciences, Globalization, The North American Union, Secret Societies and the Occult, Constitutional Studies and Law, and many more.
[01:35:13.426 --> 01:35:20.490]  It's Brave New Books, ladies and gentlemen, right at the end of Guadalupe, right where the drag starts on the south end of Guadalupe.
[01:35:21.151 --> 01:35:24.693]  The website is BraveNewBookstore.com.
[01:35:25.113 --> 01:35:28.114]  On PrisonPlanet.com, on the right-hand side, we have a big fat link to them.
[01:35:28.375 --> 01:35:30.696]  Their symbol is the all-seeing eye of Horace.
[01:35:31.388 --> 01:35:31.948]  No, I don't.
[01:35:51.557 --> 01:35:52.377]  Very well vetted.
[01:35:52.457 --> 01:35:56.818]  It's just an amazing bookstore, and we're so proud to have them as sponsors.
[01:35:56.838 --> 01:36:02.500]  They also have weekly events, sometimes daily events, and different film screenings there, and showings, and guests that are coming in.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:08.321]  So give them a call at 866-516-6623 or bravenewbookstore.com.
[01:36:08.561 --> 01:36:11.182]  I'm going to be having some events there in the next month or so as well.
[01:36:11.202 --> 01:36:14.742]  We'll be telling you about those today.
[01:36:15.943 --> 01:36:17.123]  There is another
[01:36:17.995 --> 01:36:20.998]  That's a fabulous sponsor that I wanted to tell you about, and that's BedFan.
[01:36:21.338 --> 01:36:26.943]  You know, so many people crank down their air conditioners at night, but still you get hot under the covers.
[01:36:26.983 --> 01:36:27.624]  I'm the same way.
[01:36:27.644 --> 01:36:31.988]  Well, what you do is you hook this little BedFan up that just goes on the end of the bed.
[01:36:32.008 --> 01:36:32.768]  You don't even see it.
[01:36:32.848 --> 01:36:34.730]  It plugs in, doesn't make any noise.
[01:36:35.231 --> 01:36:39.494]  They get to put your head right up until you can hear it, but it's kind of a soothing, just a very low hum.
[01:36:40.115 --> 01:36:43.378]  And then it just shoots air, the fan, up under the covers.
[01:36:44.122 --> 01:36:47.044]  And it's just a... I mean, I love sleeping in a cold bed.
[01:36:47.644 --> 01:36:49.406]  And you can save money on the A.C.
[01:36:49.446 --> 01:36:53.268]  because you've got to crank it down to like 65 to really get that cool feeling in the bed.
[01:36:53.348 --> 01:36:54.329]  I mean, I love that cool feeling.
[01:36:54.349 --> 01:36:54.989]  Some of you may not.
[01:36:55.149 --> 01:36:56.650]  You like flopping around in a hot bed.
[01:36:56.931 --> 01:37:00.933]  But with this, you can have the thing at 72, 75, and have the bed fan and it's cool.
[01:37:01.273 --> 01:37:02.574]  Give them a call, folks, at 1-800-738-0477.
[01:37:02.594 --> 01:37:02.654]  1-800-738-0477.
[01:37:02.674 --> 01:37:02.955]  Or BedFan.com.
[01:37:03.015 --> 01:37:03.395]  BedFan.com.
[01:37:13.141 --> 01:37:16.783]  Okay, going now to our guest, Paul Kunstler.
[01:37:17.564 --> 01:37:20.005]  Paul, thank you for spending time with us on this Friday edition.
[01:37:20.285 --> 01:37:30.532]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and what you do in D.C., how you started researching the JFK case, and what led you to spend $196,000 of your own money to buy something in the old
[01:37:36.736 --> 01:37:39.679]  The Silver Lady of the New York Times.
[01:37:40.299 --> 01:37:42.141]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:37:42.181 --> 01:37:43.382]  Thank you very much.
[01:37:43.822 --> 01:37:47.165]  I have lived in Washington since Thursday, December 28, 1961.
[01:37:47.285 --> 01:38:02.697]  When I was a boy, I had an interest in President Lincoln's assassination, which influenced what I would do later in life.
[01:38:04.176 --> 01:38:06.997]  I actually staged a production at St.
[01:38:07.037 --> 01:38:09.458]  Joan of Arc Grade School in St.
[01:38:09.498 --> 01:38:14.879]  Clair Shores, Michigan of the day Lincoln was shot and played John Wilkes Booth.
[01:38:15.359 --> 01:38:23.001]  But anyways, it gave me... I read other books and it gave me this belief that people believed in conspiracies.
[01:38:23.562 --> 01:38:31.444]  Now, in the fall of 1960, I was active in John Kennedy's campaign for president.
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:47.070]  And I met John Kennedy the day before Labor Day at Detroit Metropolitan Airport when he came in for the opening of the campaign in Cadillac Square.
[01:38:47.110 --> 01:38:53.834]  That's when Democratic campaigns were opened in downtown Detroit because of Labor Day.
[01:38:55.295 --> 01:39:01.760]  On January 18, 1961, I came to Washington for the Kennedy Inaugural
[01:39:02.355 --> 01:39:08.218]  inauguration with another young friend and four other young Democrats.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:17.764]  I was in Washington at the time of the assassination, as was my late partner in life, Stephen Brent Miller.
[01:39:18.444 --> 01:39:21.026]  We were together more than 42 years before he died.
[01:39:21.346 --> 01:39:24.308]  But anyways, I came with a friend.
[01:39:25.468 --> 01:39:31.572]  And later in the aftermath of the assassination, when I was went back to my parents home,
[01:39:33.135 --> 01:39:45.138]  In the fall of 1964 during the Johnson Goldwater campaign, I found my friend very disillusioned in Senegal.
[01:39:45.218 --> 01:39:49.199]  He didn't approve of my support of Lyndon Johnson.
[01:39:49.239 --> 01:39:51.120]  Later on, he became paranoid.
[01:39:52.545 --> 01:40:08.961]  But in the spring of 1990, when Mark Lane published his landmark book, Rush to Judgment on the Kennedy assassination, and Jim Garrison had his trial of Clay Shaw in New Orleans,
[01:40:11.363 --> 01:40:11.864]  I don't
[01:40:32.003 --> 01:41:01.330]  Rush to Judgment, the interviews of dozens of witnesses who were in Dealey Plaza that day, and I kept it for about six months, but in October of 91, I watched it over a period of four nights, and I realized at the end of the fourth night that I knew nothing about the assassination, and that this was such a central event in my life, I decided to study it, and I then bought my first book,
[01:41:02.449 --> 01:41:07.791]  Jim Morris's Crossfire, who was a Dallas journalist.
[01:41:08.292 --> 01:41:09.472]  Sure, a good friend of mine.
[01:41:09.492 --> 01:41:10.533]  So that's your background.
[01:41:10.553 --> 01:41:13.814]  You also run a big transcript and recording.
[01:41:13.834 --> 01:41:14.514]  Correct, yes.
[01:41:15.234 --> 01:41:19.656]  Actually, my late partner in life was Stephen Brent Miller.
[01:41:19.876 --> 01:41:24.038]  It was his company, Miller Reporting Company, and I inherited it.
[01:41:24.778 --> 01:41:28.685]  from him after he died on July 18, 2004.
[01:41:29.486 --> 01:41:34.736]  Before that, I was with the National Science Teachers Association for 31 and a half years.
[01:41:37.230 --> 01:41:39.732]  Sure, so that's some background.
[01:41:39.952 --> 01:41:43.775]  Now there's so much new evidence coming out on JFK.
[01:41:43.795 --> 01:41:54.704]  You knew about a couple months ago the new development with the Rolling Stone reporting on the E. Howard Hunt transcripts where he wrote this out to his son St.
[01:41:54.745 --> 01:42:03.152]  John, but you didn't know until just now that we've released and played here the audio where Hunt's admitting that he ran the op to kill Kennedy.
[01:42:03.872 --> 01:42:14.239]  I didn't know until last weekend, when I saw you on the INN report, that new congressional material had been released.
[01:42:14.279 --> 01:42:19.242]  So my point is, even if you're in this stuff, there's so much evidence coming out, you can't keep track of it.
[01:42:19.562 --> 01:42:26.586]  I mean, what was this new evidence that you discovered, which can be confirmed, released by Congress, that is so big, you spent $196,000 just to buy one ad?
[01:42:29.348 --> 01:42:29.648]  Yes.
[01:42:30.008 --> 01:42:35.591]  It was a two-page spread, too, on the July 31st edition of the New York Times.
[01:42:35.991 --> 01:42:39.052]  I will say something further, back up a minute.
[01:42:39.112 --> 01:42:45.235]  My company, Miller Reporting Company, reported the Assassination Records Review Board.
[01:42:46.055 --> 01:42:57.340]  On Monday, November 9, 1998, after the board issued its final report, a final press conference was held to announce that the government autopsy
[01:43:04.929 --> 01:43:13.896]  Now, again, we have always been told this by the experts, those that talk to the coroners, and a lot of them mysteriously died, but now it's being reported by internal review boards.
[01:43:14.156 --> 01:43:15.678]  I mean, go through this slowly for folks.
[01:43:19.309 --> 01:43:27.559]  And it was, there was an AP story, Associated Press story, about that, and there was a long story about it in the Washington Post.
[01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:29.402]  But let me tell you now.
[01:43:30.794 --> 01:43:40.479]  In negotiating with the New York Times through my ad agency, the Times requested 21 changes.
[01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:44.922]  And I want to tell you about two of those changes because they're very important.
[01:43:45.602 --> 01:43:49.384]  The first one is in the first column about Gerald Posner.
[01:43:50.264 --> 01:43:51.625]  His book Case Closed.
[01:43:52.485 --> 01:43:55.867]  I have since been in communication with Paul Kangas.
[01:43:55.967 --> 01:43:57.568]  It's K-A-N-G-A-S.
[01:43:58.286 --> 01:44:04.811]  In San Francisco, and I have learned that Gerald Posner never wrote the book Case Closed.
[01:44:05.171 --> 01:44:15.358]  The CIA wrote it for him, and he was in law school, and they just came and got him, used him as a front man.
[01:44:17.053 --> 01:44:18.494]  And what is the documentation for that?
[01:44:18.514 --> 01:44:20.556]  I mean, Posner acts completely like a shill.
[01:44:20.596 --> 01:44:25.160]  He's now putting out books on 9-11 and, you know, that not being an inside job.
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:34.587]  Well, you know... I mean, we know he's a... If you've ever read Case Close, basically it's a lot of... He simply says over and over again, I'm right and the others are wrong.
[01:44:34.687 --> 01:44:36.548]  No, no, and it's written in low-grade moron level, yeah.
[01:44:36.728 --> 01:44:38.049]  Yes, I know.
[01:44:38.170 --> 01:44:40.711]  So there's a lot of... I mean, it's absurd, you know.
[01:44:41.212 --> 01:44:43.253]  But what is the evidence this fellow has for that?
[01:44:43.273 --> 01:44:46.416]  I mean, I believe it, but... He has studied the assassination
[01:44:47.068 --> 01:44:58.654]  Since 1970 and he has, I'm doing a meeting with him in San Francisco on September 2 from 2 to 5 p.m.
[01:44:59.495 --> 01:45:07.579]  It's either going to be at the San Francisco Hilton Towers in downtown San Francisco on O'Farrell Street or across from the
[01:45:08.659 --> 01:45:09.860]  At the Hotel Niko.
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:18.627]  He has 100 slides, including slides of the missing frame of the Sabruder film.
[01:45:19.047 --> 01:45:25.072]  You know, all the evidence was all... Let's talk about this new congressional situation with the brain, because that's key.
[01:45:26.012 --> 01:45:27.213]  It is key.
[01:45:29.876 --> 01:45:31.877]  Well, let me... Just hold a minute.
[01:45:32.698 --> 01:45:36.441]  Let me get the... Because this was written by
[01:45:37.481 --> 01:45:43.005]  The very individual who held the press conference.
[01:45:43.085 --> 01:45:43.806]  I'll read it to you.
[01:45:44.346 --> 01:46:03.761]  On Monday, November 9, 1998, the National Archives released to the public all the working files of the Assassination Records Review Board and its staff, covering the recently completed four-year effort of that independent federal agency to find and release
[01:46:04.358 --> 01:46:07.739]  government records related to the Kennedy assassination.
[01:46:08.339 --> 01:46:30.004]  Among the internal records released that that day was a 32-page research paper written by AARP's Chief Analyst for Military Records which provide compelling evidence there were two different brain specimens examined following the autopsy on the body of JFK.
[01:46:30.425 --> 01:46:31.785]  President Kennedy's brain
[01:46:32.686 --> 01:46:38.569]  As was expected, and a fraudulent, substituted brain specimen at a later date.
[01:46:39.009 --> 01:46:51.134]  And the brain photographs in the National Archives today, in the so-called autopsy collection, are not images of President Kennedy's brain, but are images of someone else's.
[01:46:51.714 --> 01:46:56.396]  All photographic records of President Kennedy's brain have disappeared.
[01:46:57.051 --> 01:47:01.994]  Since his pattern of damage was consisted of being shot from the front.
[01:47:02.315 --> 01:47:03.956]  They also stole the brain itself.
[01:47:04.156 --> 01:47:05.117]  Yes, that's right.
[01:47:05.377 --> 01:47:14.984]  And that happened from the National Archives once there was a test that would demonstrate the direction of the bullets.
[01:47:15.864 --> 01:47:19.727]  Now we also have the original autopsy drawing showing many more holes.
[01:47:20.067 --> 01:47:21.068]  That's now come out too.
[01:47:21.866 --> 01:47:28.888]  Yes, all 14 doctors and nurses at Parkland Hospital knew that he was shot twice from the front.
[01:47:29.469 --> 01:47:49.976]  First in the neck and finally in the forehead which crashed through the back of his head causing a massive hole in the back of his head and the small
[01:47:52.253 --> 01:48:04.778]  The small hole in the right temple was covered up, and in the forged photograph, a small matte insert was put into place to cover up the massive hole in the back of his head.
[01:48:05.678 --> 01:48:07.419]  Which you can see on the film, anyways.
[01:48:07.479 --> 01:48:09.020]  I mean, the whole back of his head blows off.
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:10.240]  Yes.
[01:48:11.161 --> 01:48:13.662]  I want to tell you something else about the ad.
[01:48:13.902 --> 01:48:21.785]  There was a major, uh, something that was deleted, uh, and I'll read it to you, and I'll tell you what it was that was deleted.
[01:48:22.745 --> 01:48:27.226]  It's in on page 17 in the first column towards the top.
[01:48:27.847 --> 01:48:35.309]  Later that morning, Nixon flew out of Dallas Love Field at 9.05am on American Airlines flight 82.
[01:48:35.349 --> 01:48:42.331]  He was then legal counsel for Pepsi-Cola and was allegedly in Dallas to attend a company meeting.
[01:48:43.130 --> 01:48:54.221]  CIA agent Russell Bentliff will tell the Washington Star in 1976 that PepsiCo had set up a bottling plant in Laos in the early 1960s.
[01:48:54.321 --> 01:49:03.270]  Now this is what was deleted that did not make Pepsi but rather converted opium into heroin.
[01:49:04.574 --> 01:49:05.815]  And then it goes on.
[01:49:06.055 --> 01:49:13.940]  One of the immediate consequences of the JFK assassination will be the escalation of American involvement in Vietnam.
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:20.184]  In theory, providing the alleged Pepsi-Cola plant with a great deal more business.
[01:49:20.644 --> 01:49:24.647]  We know, of course, there would have been no Vietnam War had Kennedy lived.
[01:49:25.307 --> 01:49:32.712]  The implication is here, is that Pepsi-Cola plant made a lot of money selling heroin to our soldiers in Vietnam.
[01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:35.741]  Amazing!
[01:49:35.781 --> 01:49:37.962]  So that's something we obviously wanted out of the ad.
[01:49:38.062 --> 01:49:38.743]  Stay there, sir.
[01:49:38.783 --> 01:49:40.824]  You put this big ad in the newspaper.
[01:49:40.844 --> 01:49:47.069]  I want to talk about the aftermath of it and some of the key info that did make it in the ad, which has been confirmed.
[01:49:47.509 --> 01:49:48.310]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:55.766 --> 01:50:01.232]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:01.593 --> 01:50:09.221]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.918 --> 01:50:16.983]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.384 --> 01:50:28.812]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.112 --> 01:50:32.615]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.095 --> 01:50:35.017]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.337 --> 01:50:39.120]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:57.392]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:57.452 --> 01:51:04.754]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:04.914 --> 01:51:15.577]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:15.738 --> 01:51:20.279]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:20.579 --> 01:51:25.565]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[01:51:25.765 --> 01:51:28.709]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:28.949 --> 01:51:38.760]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:51:54.553 --> 01:51:55.313]  Pinch me, Bill.
[01:51:55.573 --> 01:51:56.554]  I can't believe it.
[01:51:56.974 --> 01:51:59.757]  A few months ago, I couldn't even afford gas for my car.
[01:52:00.137 --> 01:52:02.619]  And here we are with season tickets on the 50-yard line.
[01:52:03.848 --> 01:52:04.849]  You know what you mean, John.
[01:52:04.869 --> 01:52:09.014]  I remember the day you saw my new car and asked me if I robbed Bill Gates.
[01:52:09.595 --> 01:52:13.400]  Our lives sure have changed since we discovered DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:15.082]  I was struggling to make ends meet.
[01:52:15.542 --> 01:52:20.388]  Now I've got a new car and a college fund for Lisa when she graduates from high school next year.
[01:52:20.728 --> 01:52:21.790]  And I owe it all to you.
[01:52:22.370 --> 01:52:25.671]  Because you told me about DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:52:25.792 --> 01:52:28.793]  Hey John, we all win when the money problems disappear.
[01:52:28.813 --> 01:52:30.153]  I want to tell everybody.
[01:52:30.353 --> 01:52:33.735]  Because the more people we have on the success team, the better it works.
[01:52:34.095 --> 01:52:35.756]  It's hard for the little guy these days.
[01:52:36.036 --> 01:52:38.697]  We pool our resources to level the playing field.
[01:52:38.837 --> 01:52:45.019]  So the more people that go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com, the more cash for everybody.
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:46.140]  What a concept!
[01:53:06.445 --> 01:53:19.235]  Well, Paul Kunstler is our guest, and if you just Google his name or link through to Infowars.com, you can find a big two-page spread in the New York Times documenting a lot of information about the assassination of President Kennedy.
[01:53:20.236 --> 01:53:26.541]  Coming up in the next hour, we're going to open the phones up and talk about neocons openly calling to make Bush dictator of the world.
[01:53:26.802 --> 01:53:27.522]  We're not joking.
[01:53:27.562 --> 01:53:28.443]  I'm going to read the quotes.
[01:53:29.255 --> 01:53:36.584]  This is a known neocon group run by the former CIA director and others calling for Bush to be dictator.
[01:53:37.705 --> 01:53:40.028]  They are recruiting preachers all over the country for it.
[01:53:40.048 --> 01:53:41.430]  They're gearing up for martial law.
[01:53:42.435 --> 01:53:44.455]  No, they're saying we're going to have domestic passports.
[01:53:45.156 --> 01:53:47.196]  They could try to pull it, okay?
[01:53:47.256 --> 01:53:50.316]  I mean, it's hard to believe, but they're the ones saying it.
[01:53:50.356 --> 01:53:52.297]  That's coming up in the next hour when we're taking your calls.
[01:53:53.057 --> 01:54:01.438]  In the three or four minutes we've got left, Paul, other key points that are in the ad or anything that was taken out of the ad that you'd like to give people your perspective on?
[01:54:01.458 --> 01:54:09.880]  No, but I think you're... I've covered the ad, but I think your program originates in Austin, Texas, correct?
[01:54:10.822 --> 01:54:11.223]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:11.263 --> 01:54:12.584]  I think your phone's muffled now.
[01:54:12.624 --> 01:54:15.327]  Can you hear me now?
[01:54:15.387 --> 01:54:16.889]  Yes, we're in Austin, Texas.
[01:54:17.590 --> 01:54:20.533]  Your program originates in Austin, Texas?
[01:54:21.254 --> 01:54:21.514]  Yes.
[01:54:22.435 --> 01:54:30.465]  Well, I received a letter from Evan Wilson of Austin, Texas, dated August 1, the day after
[01:54:31.053 --> 01:54:41.160]  Yeah, he wrote to me, Dear Mr. Kunstler, in November 1963, I was an Army Intelligence Special Agent assigned to Berdow Plants.
[01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:55.509]  He said, um, after the assassination, he received a specific receipt, came down, it described a conversation between an enlisted man and his company commander in Germany.
[01:54:56.027 --> 01:55:06.275]  The enlisted man had told his captain before November 22 that President Kennedy would be assassinated in Dallas, in Texas.
[01:55:08.777 --> 01:55:25.130]  Yeah, there's a lot of evidence and a lot of information out there, but the fact that the congressional documents are being released about the brains being manipulated and the wounds being manipulated and the photos being manipulated, we've talked to the people at the funeral home
[01:55:26.079 --> 01:55:27.540]  With Lee Harvey Oswald.
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:28.201]  Correct.
[01:55:28.261 --> 01:55:37.046]  Jim Mars and others have, where the Secret Service came in and stuck the rifle in his hand to get the prints for the Warren Commission.
[01:55:38.387 --> 01:55:41.890]  But before I go, I need to tell you the most critical piece of evidence.
[01:55:42.250 --> 01:55:42.930]  Go ahead and tell us.
[01:55:43.591 --> 01:55:44.491]  Pardon?
[01:55:44.531 --> 01:55:45.432]  Yes, go ahead and tell us.
[01:55:45.792 --> 01:55:53.497]  Okay, I received a letter from Lawrence Patterson, who's a publisher of Criminal Politics magazine.
[01:55:53.777 --> 01:55:54.738]  He sent me the book
[01:55:55.924 --> 01:55:59.066]  Regenocide, which means the killing of the king.
[01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:04.328]  And it has the master plan for the CIA.
[01:56:04.448 --> 01:56:07.529]  The CIA's master plan for the assassination.
[01:56:07.870 --> 01:56:10.191]  Again, sir, your phone's really muffled.
[01:56:10.211 --> 01:56:11.171]  Can you talk right into it?
[01:56:11.331 --> 01:56:24.277]  Okay, once again, I received from Lawrence Patterson a book called Regenocide, which means the killing of the king, by Gregory Douglas.
[01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:40.993]  In it, he has the papers of a once high-level member of the CIA, and includes the master plan for the assassination called Operation Zipper.
[01:56:42.693 --> 01:56:51.095]  And it goes on with great, and again, with the descriptions, with the planning, starting in March 1st, 1963, all the way up to the
[01:56:53.670 --> 01:56:57.532]  On the assassination and who was there, including J. Edgar Hoover.
[01:56:58.433 --> 01:57:05.356]  Well, that matches with all the intel we've got from the head guy on the ground, E. Howard Hines, from the mistress of LBJ and the rest of it.
[01:57:05.897 --> 01:57:08.358]  Mr. Kunstler, thank you so much for your research and your work.
[01:57:08.398 --> 01:57:09.278]  It was good talking to you.
[01:57:09.719 --> 01:57:10.459]  Okay, thank you.
[01:57:10.739 --> 01:57:11.099]  You bet.
[01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:13.020]  Sorry about that, folks.
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:21.405]  His phone was out of this world bad, but you spent $196,000 to put some interesting facts and some other things we haven't proven in
[01:57:23.502 --> 01:57:24.363]  That publication.
[01:57:24.743 --> 01:57:27.166]  Okay, back to the really big issues.
[01:57:27.646 --> 01:57:29.788]  On the other side, one full hour left.
[01:57:29.808 --> 01:57:30.329]  Stay with me.
[01:57:32.691 --> 01:57:36.594]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:36.935 --> 01:57:37.795]  Or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.042 --> 01:57:49.682]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.343 --> 01:57:51.384]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.104 --> 01:57:53.225]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.885 --> 01:57:54.686]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.446 --> 01:57:56.367]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.027 --> 01:58:00.669]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.190 --> 01:58:05.332]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.333 --> 01:58:08.214]  We are now into hour number three.
[01:58:08.274 --> 01:58:14.498]  I want to give you a chance, because you didn't have much of a chance yesterday, or in the last two hours, to comment on
[01:58:15.604 --> 01:58:21.288]  Secret recruiting of preachers nationwide, telling their clergy to turn their guns in, to go into FEMA camps.
[01:58:21.308 --> 01:58:22.489]  That was admitted on the news.
[01:58:23.010 --> 01:58:26.132]  But then you heard the local emergency manager who wasn't even aware of all this.
[01:58:26.192 --> 01:58:28.154]  See, because the feds are just running this themselves.
[01:58:29.495 --> 01:58:30.335]  And putting this out.
[01:58:31.476 --> 01:58:33.878]  Also, they want you to have a domestic passport.
[01:58:33.918 --> 01:58:36.680]  If the states say no to the Real ID Act, we'll tell you what's really behind that.
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:40.303]  More on the economy as they pump hundreds of billions in globally.
[01:58:41.327 --> 01:58:43.068]  Almost now, on a daily basis.
[01:58:43.128 --> 01:58:44.269]  I was counting it up yesterday.
[01:58:44.309 --> 01:58:47.191]  About a hundred plus billion globally was put in that we know of.
[01:58:48.112 --> 01:58:55.076]  Total, now it's got to be over 600 billion bucks that they have pumped in on Monday.
[01:58:55.096 --> 01:58:56.357]  It was 400 and something billion.
[01:58:57.418 --> 01:58:59.659]  It is, and they've cut interest rates.
[01:58:59.779 --> 01:59:01.020]  We'll see if that works.
[01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:04.862]  They didn't cut the bond rate, but they did cut the basic loan rate.
[01:59:05.643 --> 01:59:07.184]  So there's a lot of things going on.
[01:59:07.264 --> 01:59:08.745]  I want to hear from you on all of this.
[01:59:10.251 --> 01:59:10.752]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:10.772 --> 01:59:11.753]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:11.913 --> 01:59:19.221]  Neocons make Bush dictator of the world.
[01:59:19.261 --> 01:59:19.962]  That's what they want.
[01:59:20.542 --> 01:59:22.505]  And it's one of the top neocons calling for that.
[01:59:22.945 --> 01:59:25.408]  You put that together with all the other stuff they're putting out and saying.
[01:59:26.363 --> 01:59:27.764]  These people are right out in the open.
[01:59:27.884 --> 01:59:29.166]  I mean, they are getting delusional.
[01:59:29.686 --> 01:59:33.809]  Or is it a psychological tactic just to hide their criminality in plain view?
[01:59:33.849 --> 01:59:39.795]  We'll be talking about... I mean, they're talking about martial law, making Bush dictator, arresting everyone, killing everyone.
[01:59:39.815 --> 01:59:42.157]  I'm going to read more of this article coming up too, I promise.
[01:59:42.477 --> 01:59:44.458]  George in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:59:44.479 --> 01:59:45.119]  Thanks for holding.
[01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:47.021]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:59:47.361 --> 01:59:47.621]  Hi.
[01:59:48.282 --> 01:59:52.005]  Yes, I really think if they have this 9-11 style attack,
[01:59:52.665 --> 01:59:59.613]  I really believe it's going to backfire on their faces, because the reason is the Iraqi enforcement on the immigration laws is open border.
[01:59:59.633 --> 02:00:09.503]  I mean, I just came back from vacation in Tombstone, Arizona, and we went along the border going between Douglas and Bisbee, and we see Mexican troops on our side of the fence.
[02:00:10.344 --> 02:00:13.808]  And then we go from El Paso to Houston.
[02:00:14.358 --> 02:00:21.165]  And all I see is American families sitting on the side of the road while the Texas State Troopers are throwing stuff... No, I know.
[02:00:21.445 --> 02:00:23.007]  I know, it's pathetic.
[02:00:23.227 --> 02:00:23.668]  I know.
[02:00:24.168 --> 02:00:34.739]  Listen, in Tombstone, they admit, that's the area there, near Cochise, where they've killed Border Patrol, killed FBI, shoot the citizens, burned down, in one night alone, 14 houses.
[02:00:35.940 --> 02:00:37.441]  I mean, it's out and out war.
[02:00:37.621 --> 02:00:41.264]  The Mexican troops have openly said they're burning things to burn out the Border Patrol.
[02:00:41.284 --> 02:00:43.646]  The Border Patrol has now completely retreated.
[02:00:43.666 --> 02:00:45.047]  They've been told not to fire back.
[02:00:45.587 --> 02:00:47.349]  I mean, it's land of the cowardly scum.
[02:00:47.409 --> 02:00:48.910]  Home of the brave is gone.
[02:00:49.630 --> 02:00:52.212]  And I want to become land of the free, home of the brave again.
[02:00:52.653 --> 02:00:53.994]  But it just shows it exactly.
[02:00:54.074 --> 02:00:55.955]  State police everywhere, searching everyone.
[02:00:56.235 --> 02:00:58.137]  Citizens being chased down like cattle.
[02:00:58.397 --> 02:01:00.999]  CPS grabbing our children as we cower.
[02:01:01.339 --> 02:01:02.320]  Meanwhile, the illegals
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:07.881]  Patron Pizza takes pesos and they walk in and they say, we're here to serve Hispanics.
[02:01:08.281 --> 02:01:10.862]  I mean, I think I'm going to start a restaurant and say, we're here to serve whites.
[02:01:11.302 --> 02:01:12.602]  And again, folks, I wouldn't do that.
[02:01:12.642 --> 02:01:13.262]  I love everybody.
[02:01:13.302 --> 02:01:18.883]  The point is, is that the globalists are destroying this country any way they can.
[02:01:20.924 --> 02:01:25.725]  You had a guest, Greg Pound, on a few months ago, and I'm a good friend of Greg Pound.
[02:01:26.405 --> 02:01:28.085]  Can I give you an update on what's going on with him?
[02:01:28.565 --> 02:01:30.946]  That's where the CPS kidnapped their children, yes.
[02:01:31.667 --> 02:01:32.027]  Oh, yes.
[02:01:32.107 --> 02:01:42.149]  Well, the county sheriff, because Greg Pound wanted questions for the county sheriff, told him, well, now he's got to go through his court-appointed lawyer, and Greg Pound can't answer sheriff's questions.
[02:01:42.590 --> 02:01:44.930]  And plus, they're trying to get... Yes, since when in this free society?
[02:01:45.150 --> 02:01:51.672]  By the way, the lady that kidnapped his children went to prison for filing a false report, but they say, we don't care if it's a false report.
[02:01:52.532 --> 02:01:54.872]  Well, all she got was one year probation.
[02:01:55.472 --> 02:01:57.613]  Well, I knew she was in court, and I knew she'd been convicted.
[02:01:58.419 --> 02:02:04.082]  Well, anyway, uh... The lady that filed the report got convicted of lying, but they say we don't care.
[02:02:04.702 --> 02:02:05.723]  Child kidnappers.
[02:02:05.763 --> 02:02:07.263]  That's your scumbag government.
[02:02:07.323 --> 02:02:11.145]  I mean, we need to start recognizing the government is scum-filled.
[02:02:13.086 --> 02:02:19.069]  Well, also, too, they're trying to get Greg for stalking because she's out there at protest signs protesting the Judge Marion Fletcher.
[02:02:19.089 --> 02:02:20.129]  All right, I'll get them back on.
[02:02:20.169 --> 02:02:21.950]  Yeah, I know they harass good people to death.
[02:02:22.691 --> 02:02:22.971]  I know.
[02:02:23.031 --> 02:02:23.651]  Hey, listen.
[02:02:23.711 --> 02:02:25.252]  Let me just tell you something, corrupt cops.
[02:02:25.865 --> 02:02:28.989]  They're shooting you up full of the cancer virus too, and the mercury.
[02:02:29.009 --> 02:02:33.856]  And they're going to take your cousins kids, and all this evil you engage in is going to come back on you.
[02:02:33.876 --> 02:02:34.617]  Okay?
[02:02:34.937 --> 02:02:36.299]  You got God to deal with.
[02:02:36.559 --> 02:02:39.022]  You may not believe in God, but God believes in you.
[02:02:39.643 --> 02:02:42.667]  You may not believe in the devil, but the devil believes in you.
[02:02:44.764 --> 02:02:49.845]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:02:49.905 --> 02:02:57.227]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:02:57.367 --> 02:03:08.029]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:03:08.209 --> 02:03:12.750]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:18.013]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:03:18.233 --> 02:03:21.175]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:03:21.395 --> 02:03:31.081]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[02:03:31.281 --> 02:03:36.149]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:03:36.169 --> 02:03:37.892]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:03:47.601 --> 02:03:50.805]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:03:51.126 --> 02:03:53.068]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:53.449 --> 02:04:01.078]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:01.781 --> 02:04:08.827]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.227 --> 02:04:20.696]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:20.957 --> 02:04:24.479]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:26.921]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.202 --> 02:04:31.045]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:05:49.364 --> 02:05:50.004]  Big Brother.
[02:05:50.685 --> 02:05:51.745]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.446 --> 02:05:53.546]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.207 --> 02:05:55.027]  You want answers?
[02:05:55.788 --> 02:05:56.668]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:56.688 --> 02:06:01.130]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.531 --> 02:06:05.613]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.058 --> 02:06:24.946]  A huge political organization owned and operated by White House operatives is openly calling for President Bush to be made world dictator and to kill opposition at home to nuke the Middle East and engage in mass genocide.
[02:06:25.006 --> 02:06:26.807]  Word for word, go read it.
[02:06:27.447 --> 02:06:31.589]  And Digg has made the article non-searchable and they're on there celebrating how they're blocking it.
[02:06:32.570 --> 02:06:35.631]  Okay, now we rammed through in a Digg revolt yesterday.
[02:06:35.671 --> 02:06:37.132]  We haven't had anything on Digg in two weeks.
[02:06:38.062 --> 02:06:41.063]  The AP was reporting that newspaper circulation is in free fall.
[02:06:41.363 --> 02:06:42.804]  Time Magazine is imploding.
[02:06:43.204 --> 02:06:44.224]  They're all panicking.
[02:06:44.244 --> 02:06:47.506]  But they mentioned Digg has these 15 million visitors a day or whatever.
[02:06:47.846 --> 02:06:49.766]  Yeah, and we need to be on the main page of that.
[02:06:49.786 --> 02:06:52.087]  And we could be on there every day, but they censor us.
[02:06:52.487 --> 02:06:59.330]  It takes a massive group to just overpower and overdrive them or resubmit it under other headlines to defeat them.
[02:06:59.970 --> 02:07:01.571]  Now, they're in there celebrating right now.
[02:07:02.131 --> 02:07:04.652]  You rammed through the enemy forces yesterday.
[02:07:05.763 --> 02:07:14.714]  And so a lot of people got to see it, and it went supernova with a story about how they're recruiting the preachers for martial law and gun confiscation.
[02:07:14.794 --> 02:07:20.622]  And by getting that out, not just through DIG, but a hundred other places, but it's one of the key breaches in the enemy wall,
[02:07:21.704 --> 02:07:22.784]  Wikipedia is, too.
[02:07:23.125 --> 02:07:24.045]  They tried to censor us.
[02:07:24.085 --> 02:07:29.387]  We've now launched Ops in the last month, and I'm not saying we did it all, but you listeners are responsible for most of it.
[02:07:30.247 --> 02:07:32.068]  They're now being completely discredited and annihilated.
[02:07:33.028 --> 02:07:34.449]  We're not playing games here, folks.
[02:07:34.469 --> 02:07:35.349]  We're in the Info War.
[02:07:35.689 --> 02:07:41.091]  You plan to put us in FEMA camps, we plan to fight you in the Info War as long as we can before we get even more serious.
[02:07:42.012 --> 02:07:45.313]  And so, you go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:07:46.053 --> 02:07:50.455]  This is another Dig Revolt, and you get the story, Make Bush Dictator of the World, and you get it.
[02:07:51.286 --> 02:08:05.374]  And you simultaneously tell others to dig it, and then you also change the headline, feel free, and re-dig it on your platform, and re-assault Dig, re-assault Myspace, assault Yahoo, assault them with the truth.
[02:08:06.054 --> 02:08:07.655]  I mean, assault them, folks.
[02:08:08.896 --> 02:08:10.037]  I mean, just go haywire.
[02:08:10.497 --> 02:08:12.318]  We have got to get this news out.
[02:08:13.044 --> 02:08:24.209]  Because in this article we show how the Salon Magazine, the neocons are all out, you know, these neocon women are all at the beach and they're like, soon we'll kill everyone that disagrees with us in gas chambers!
[02:08:25.110 --> 02:08:26.670]  This is all coming out mainstream news!
[02:08:27.050 --> 02:08:30.092]  Soon we'll be dictators and murder all of our enemies!
[02:08:31.012 --> 02:08:34.214]  Soon we'll have a world government with Bush as the leader!
[02:08:35.094 --> 02:08:41.097]  You see, I mean, you can go, what Paul does is he takes their shit comments and then he goes, oh, did you know James Woolsey runs it?
[02:08:41.867 --> 02:08:43.748]  Oh, you know, it's really a White House front.
[02:08:46.568 --> 02:08:55.991]  I mean, folks, when they got White House fronts telling you that he needs to be Supreme Ruler and kill everyone that disagrees with him, I mean, Hitler didn't say that, he just did it.
[02:08:57.971 --> 02:08:59.552]  And they're doing that because they're desperate.
[02:08:59.772 --> 02:09:02.873]  And I'm telling you, I want the heads of these groups, I want them arrested.
[02:09:03.293 --> 02:09:04.513]  I'm not calling for their murder.
[02:09:05.399 --> 02:09:10.563]  But I want grand juries, I want indictments when we take this country back, and I want them hauled up for treason.
[02:09:11.083 --> 02:09:11.803]  I'm serious.
[02:09:12.404 --> 02:09:16.046]  I mean, they want to come in here and they want to kill us!
[02:09:17.187 --> 02:09:21.650]  I've heard Michael Savage say it, how they're going to kill people once another attack comes.
[02:09:21.930 --> 02:09:23.791]  Yeah, that we know your bosses are going to pull.
[02:09:24.332 --> 02:09:29.115]  You phony conservatives need to be strung up once you've been found guilty of high treason.
[02:09:29.901 --> 02:09:31.982]  For getting rid of our borders for the North American Union.
[02:09:32.002 --> 02:09:34.983]  You know, James Woolsey sits up there and talks about defending America.
[02:09:35.003 --> 02:09:37.524]  Now we got a glass parking lot, the Arabs all day.
[02:09:37.744 --> 02:09:39.345]  But he's not for controlling our borders.
[02:09:39.905 --> 02:09:41.485]  In fact, he was for the amnesty plan.
[02:09:42.026 --> 02:09:47.007]  And he was up there at the Banff Canada meeting last year, running the SPP and the NAU.
[02:09:47.588 --> 02:09:49.308]  These people aren't patriots!
[02:09:49.728 --> 02:09:51.529]  They're not defending the Republic!
[02:09:52.089 --> 02:09:54.250]  They're here overturning our country!
[02:09:55.071 --> 02:09:56.171]  Our precious nation!
[02:09:58.305 --> 02:10:03.971]  I try not to get mad, I just think about Woolsey's head and those evil eyes, and how he thinks he's so smart!
[02:10:03.991 --> 02:10:06.233]  And how he thinks he gets to kill this country!
[02:10:07.294 --> 02:10:10.418]  And then it makes me even sicker how he poses as a conservative!
[02:10:10.999 --> 02:10:12.740]  And how he poses as a good person!
[02:10:13.081 --> 02:10:14.743]  He's an enemy of the Republic!
[02:10:17.182 --> 02:10:18.503]  I'm just sick of all of them!
[02:10:18.583 --> 02:10:19.784]  They want to kill us!
[02:10:19.804 --> 02:10:20.944]  Do you understand that?
[02:10:21.385 --> 02:10:28.509]  They want to line you and your family up and take your assets, and they want to gun you and your children down, and throw you in pits!
[02:10:29.269 --> 02:10:31.390]  Chernoff's family ran ops in Russia!
[02:10:31.410 --> 02:10:34.913]  Most of the people they got in the Pentagon ran ops!
[02:10:35.253 --> 02:10:36.774]  Brzezinski's, all of them!
[02:10:36.834 --> 02:10:38.455]  Kashvili, all of them!
[02:10:39.315 --> 02:10:41.136]  Bunch of scum, dirtbags!
[02:10:41.396 --> 02:10:44.038]  Madeline Albright's daddy was a commissarian!
[02:10:44.218 --> 02:10:44.618]  Killed 1.2 mil!
[02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:50.422]  The neocons were founded by the Trotskyites!
[02:10:50.462 --> 02:10:51.683]  That's mainstream news!
[02:10:51.723 --> 02:10:52.704]  These are killers!
[02:10:54.887 --> 02:10:56.208]  They want to kill us!
[02:10:56.868 --> 02:10:58.150]  But let me tell you something.
[02:10:58.310 --> 02:11:03.315]  This was the United States of America once, and there's still vestiges, and there's still millions of guns.
[02:11:04.736 --> 02:11:10.985]  And you may be able to get all these good ol' boys who got a lariat in the back of their truck and a big cowboy hat but never rode a horse in their life.
[02:11:11.186 --> 02:11:14.411]  You may be able to get them to waddle around and shoot their mouths off and support you.
[02:11:14.651 --> 02:11:18.537]  But if the fight never starts, they're gonna go and cry in the basement for Mommy!
[02:11:21.713 --> 02:11:26.917]  So I'm going to tell all you phony conservatives and all you talk radio listeners that listen to all these fake conservatives.
[02:11:27.337 --> 02:11:28.518]  I'm going to just tell you something.
[02:11:28.538 --> 02:11:32.101]  I'd like to knock your teeth in and I'd like to punch your eyes out.
[02:11:32.501 --> 02:11:33.382]  And let me tell you something.
[02:11:33.402 --> 02:11:36.164]  I wouldn't need to come in with a bunch of black uniforms and grab you.
[02:11:36.484 --> 02:11:40.787]  I'm saying you want to shoot your big redneck fake mouth off to me, I'll tear your head off!
[02:11:41.108 --> 02:11:41.848]  You scum!
[02:11:42.048 --> 02:11:43.369]  You enemy of America!
[02:11:43.389 --> 02:11:45.891]  I'd like to get my hands on all of you!
[02:11:46.251 --> 02:11:50.755]  You are evil, filthy, degenerate, stupid scum!
[02:11:51.877 --> 02:11:52.818]  You understand me?
[02:11:54.539 --> 02:11:55.920]  There's nothing worse than you!
[02:11:56.281 --> 02:11:56.801]  Nothing!
[02:11:57.562 --> 02:11:59.103]  Nothing on earth worse than you!
[02:11:59.263 --> 02:12:01.825]  You're a bunch of weak, dumb people!
[02:12:02.045 --> 02:12:03.246]  Most of you are retarded!
[02:12:04.367 --> 02:12:10.392]  I'm talking all the neocons out there and Troy from West Virginia and people like him that think this is all real funny!
[02:12:10.632 --> 02:12:11.874]  The death of my country!
[02:12:12.114 --> 02:12:13.515]  The death of your country!
[02:12:14.676 --> 02:12:17.518]  They got a lot of nerves sitting up there posing as conservatives.
[02:12:17.538 --> 02:12:18.599]  They're a bunch of scum.
[02:12:18.779 --> 02:12:20.721]  And Hillary and all of them are a bunch of scum too.
[02:12:22.381 --> 02:12:27.063]  I'm just trying not to get mad, folks, but when these people start talking about how they want to openly kill us, I just can't handle it anymore.
[02:12:27.743 --> 02:12:28.723]  Bunch of scum.
[02:12:30.584 --> 02:12:36.666]  Let me tell you, all you yuppies and all you wanna-be good ol' boys and all of you, you're getting what you want right now in the economy, and it's gonna get a lot better for you.
[02:12:36.686 --> 02:12:39.687]  It's gonna get worse and worse for you, scum.
[02:12:39.707 --> 02:12:42.669]  Alright, I said I'd go to your calls.
[02:12:42.949 --> 02:12:51.672]  I just... I'd rather convert these people.
[02:12:52.614 --> 02:12:56.879]  But when they start talking about how they want to kill us, and they got big god rays, there's tens of millions of these people.
[02:12:57.260 --> 02:12:59.743]  And folks, I'm telling you, they'd operate death camps in a minute.
[02:13:00.824 --> 02:13:04.769]  They'd take your baby by their hind legs and bash their brains out on a pillar in a second.
[02:13:05.689 --> 02:13:07.610]  They'd love to kill you and your family.
[02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:10.051]  Go read all the stuff we've compiled where they talk about it.
[02:13:10.512 --> 02:13:13.733]  I mean, they've written hundreds of articles where they talk about how they can't wait to kill us.
[02:13:14.334 --> 02:13:25.840]  They want to come in here and take property and take houses and take bank accounts and just waddle around in a bunch of black uniforms like this is the Red Terror in Russia and kill tens of millions of people!
[02:13:26.020 --> 02:13:27.001]  That's what they do!
[02:13:28.340 --> 02:13:30.881]  And I want you to rise up and get fired up!
[02:13:31.101 --> 02:13:31.921]  And get angry!
[02:13:32.181 --> 02:13:34.501]  And just, just start grinding your teeth!
[02:13:35.021 --> 02:13:36.722]  And just get mentally ready!
[02:13:36.742 --> 02:13:39.262]  That if they keep pushing, we're gonna take them!
[02:13:39.522 --> 02:13:41.203]  And I mean take them savage!
[02:13:41.583 --> 02:13:42.983]  I mean run them down!
[02:13:43.163 --> 02:13:46.444]  I mean take their heads and just ram them into the concrete!
[02:13:46.504 --> 02:13:48.084]  We'll just pretend it's just blast open!
[02:13:50.264 --> 02:13:51.065]  Just crush them!
[02:13:51.485 --> 02:13:52.785]  You know what I'm talking about!
[02:13:52.825 --> 02:13:56.166]  Just bite big, huge, bloody chunks right out of them!
[02:13:56.486 --> 02:13:57.566]  Nothing can stop us!
[02:14:02.469 --> 02:14:04.610]  I'm sorry folks, but that's really how I feel.
[02:14:05.011 --> 02:14:06.131]  A bunch of scum!
[02:14:09.073 --> 02:14:09.994]  Pieces of filth!
[02:14:10.734 --> 02:14:17.178]  We need to get mad about them telling us we gotta have internal passports while the illegals don't even need an ID for a bank account!
[02:14:17.719 --> 02:14:20.620]  We need to get mad about all these foreigners ruling over us!
[02:14:20.841 --> 02:14:25.764]  We need to get mad about these criminal wars they've launched in our name to demonize America's good name!
[02:14:26.404 --> 02:14:30.827]  And all these carpet-bagging filth from Europe in here running our country into the ground!
[02:14:35.282 --> 02:14:35.662]  You know what?
[02:14:35.682 --> 02:14:38.523]  I don't care if the media calls me crazy and says, you bet I'm nuts.
[02:14:38.983 --> 02:14:44.045]  Bunch of scumbags here talking about how they want to kill me and my family, how they want to kill my country!
[02:14:45.886 --> 02:14:46.346]  You know what?
[02:14:46.426 --> 02:14:49.727]  I want to fight, folks, but I know the Infowars having a big victory on them.
[02:14:51.228 --> 02:14:53.469]  We're going to keep having victories and we're coming for you.
[02:14:53.489 --> 02:14:55.630]  You've shot the whole Kit Kat and Kaboodle.
[02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:57.310]  You've run on too far.
[02:14:57.690 --> 02:14:58.591]  The jig's up.
[02:14:58.951 --> 02:15:01.452]  Everybody knows who you are now, New World Order.
[02:15:02.473 --> 02:15:05.856]  And a lot of us aren't going to make it through this, and I know that, and I'll be frank with you.
[02:15:06.096 --> 02:15:09.739]  I'm mad that you've ruined my life, you pieces of filth!
[02:15:10.079 --> 02:15:13.301]  But I can't back off from you, and I never am!
[02:15:15.223 --> 02:15:16.884]  And I just hope you realize that.
[02:15:18.385 --> 02:15:20.267]  Just don't be cowards anymore, America.
[02:15:20.507 --> 02:15:21.288]  Don't be weak.
[02:15:21.988 --> 02:15:25.431]  And don't sit there in the ditch while they shoot you in the head and laugh.
[02:15:26.171 --> 02:15:29.514]  At least if it comes down to it, give them one hell of a fight!
[02:15:32.327 --> 02:15:33.847]  I'm telling you it's the real deal!
[02:15:34.488 --> 02:15:36.288]  And you know it in your guts it is!
[02:15:37.308 --> 02:15:40.909]  And I'm gonna tell all you cops out there, you better join the American people.
[02:15:41.610 --> 02:15:43.830]  And I'm gonna tell the military that right now, too.
[02:15:43.870 --> 02:15:45.191]  You better join us!
[02:15:45.631 --> 02:15:48.752]  You better stop serving the scum of the New World Order!
[02:15:49.032 --> 02:15:52.133]  All these pot-bellied little dwarf New World Order people!
[02:15:55.333 --> 02:15:56.914]  Derek in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:15:59.655 --> 02:16:00.135]  Hey, Alex.
[02:16:00.595 --> 02:16:00.875]  Hello.
[02:16:01.758 --> 02:16:02.318]  Yeah!
[02:16:02.639 --> 02:16:04.981]  Yeah!
[02:16:05.141 --> 02:16:07.623]  Yeah!
[02:16:09.064 --> 02:16:13.327]  Hey Alex, I was on Mark Levin's Neocon Show last night trying to defend Ron Paul.
[02:16:14.148 --> 02:16:15.729]  What did that scumbag say?
[02:16:16.570 --> 02:16:19.512]  Well, you know, he doesn't let people talk like you let people talk.
[02:16:19.592 --> 02:16:21.734]  So, you know, you can't get anywhere with the guy.
[02:16:23.115 --> 02:16:28.179]  But that scumbag said that all of his audience should not vote for Ron Paul.
[02:16:29.215 --> 02:16:31.857]  And they should call his office in Washington, D.C.
[02:16:31.877 --> 02:16:33.098]  to harass him, basically.
[02:16:33.118 --> 02:16:35.460]  Don't forget, who's Mark Levin?
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:38.302]  He's on the ABC.
[02:16:38.523 --> 02:16:40.865]  He broadcasts 5 to 7 Central Standard Time.
[02:16:40.885 --> 02:16:41.825]  Oh yeah, I know who he is.
[02:16:41.965 --> 02:16:42.846]  I've heard him on XM.
[02:16:43.547 --> 02:16:44.227]  He's a lawyer.
[02:16:44.267 --> 02:16:48.591]  He got his power not because he was right on points or issues or he knew a lot.
[02:16:48.631 --> 02:16:53.455]  He just basically licked Russ Limbaugh's boots for years and years and years and that got him a slot.
[02:16:55.416 --> 02:16:55.596]  Yes.
[02:16:56.587 --> 02:17:01.171]  So anyway, I went on there last night and he gave me about five, ten words.
[02:17:01.271 --> 02:17:12.540]  I didn't really get my point out at all, but I took it home, put the deal on YouTube, you know, the conversation, so people could basically see what a buffoon is brainwashing like ten million Americans every day.
[02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:16.243]  Because yeah, Alex, you're right.
[02:17:16.304 --> 02:17:23.990]  History, Machiavellian history, Kropotkin, the Bolsheviks who backed them, the, you know, people that listen to those neocon shows,
[02:17:24.406 --> 02:17:31.000]  I'm pretty clueless to it, and I don't hate them, I don't dislike them, I just want them to read their history like you recommend so many people do all the time.
[02:17:32.824 --> 02:17:33.445]  Anything else?
[02:17:34.386 --> 02:17:42.151]  No Alex, I just want to stick your audience on that Neal Cox, Pig, Mark Levin, College Joke every day in Defender Warrior.
[02:17:42.591 --> 02:17:43.031]  Run!
[02:17:43.051 --> 02:17:43.772]  Pull!
[02:17:43.932 --> 02:17:45.173]  Yeah!
[02:17:45.273 --> 02:17:47.814]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:17:48.115 --> 02:17:53.058]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:17:53.298 --> 02:17:55.139]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled
[02:17:56.399 --> 02:18:06.861]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:18:07.062 --> 02:18:10.702]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:18:10.982 --> 02:18:16.003]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:18:16.304 --> 02:18:23.005]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:18:23.502 --> 02:18:24.183]  What about you?
[02:18:24.823 --> 02:18:30.167]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:18:33.389 --> 02:18:35.871]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:18:51.528 --> 02:18:56.331]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:56.552 --> 02:18:59.293]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:59.334 --> 02:19:00.434]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:19:01.795 --> 02:19:06.398]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:07.319 --> 02:19:14.584]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:19:15.585 --> 02:19:18.627]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[02:19:20.780 --> 02:19:24.223]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:19:25.203 --> 02:19:26.484]  Call for your copy today.
[02:19:26.745 --> 02:19:28.946]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.007 --> 02:19:35.851]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:19:36.552 --> 02:19:36.952]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:36.972 --> 02:19:37.192]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.478 --> 02:19:52.282]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two book set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[02:19:52.662 --> 02:19:59.067]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[02:19:59.527 --> 02:20:09.433]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[02:20:09.914 --> 02:20:13.376]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[02:20:13.676 --> 02:20:16.358]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[02:20:16.998 --> 02:20:19.679]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.
[02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:24.162]  Send your check for $32 post-pay to Radio Liberty P.O.

[02:20:44.822 --> 02:20:47.303]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:47.983 --> 02:20:56.566]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts Number 1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[02:20:57.546 --> 02:21:02.468]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment?
[02:21:03.548 --> 02:21:05.369]  This is minimum infringement.
[02:21:05.749 --> 02:21:06.549]  There may be more.
[02:21:07.717 --> 02:21:14.521]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[02:21:15.222 --> 02:21:23.067]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:21:23.887 --> 02:21:25.468]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:21:25.489 --> 02:21:25.809]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:21:37.947 --> 02:21:38.527]  Call now.
[02:21:38.547 --> 02:21:41.488]  Our operators are standing by to take your order.
[02:21:49.550 --> 02:21:51.471]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:51.951 --> 02:21:54.832]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.652 --> 02:21:58.453]  Look, the government is criminal.
[02:21:58.653 --> 02:22:01.734]  There's good people in and out of it, but it is run by criminals.
[02:22:03.150 --> 02:22:11.797]  And when I just sit here and see them openly saying they want to kill us, and they can't wait to take over to kill anybody who politically disagrees with them, they're not joking around, folks.
[02:22:11.838 --> 02:22:14.960]  They will come after everybody, even if you serve them.
[02:22:15.901 --> 02:22:17.783]  You've got to gear up to fight them.
[02:22:19.044 --> 02:22:20.345]  And I think we're kicking their butts right now.
[02:22:20.365 --> 02:22:25.249]  I don't think they're going to get away with what they're doing, but we can't take that for granted because they're hitting us from so many sides.
[02:22:26.957 --> 02:22:29.640]  I said I'd go to your calls and I've been yelling and screaming and frothing.
[02:22:30.020 --> 02:22:33.203]  But we should yell and scream and froth about the end of the country and total martial law.
[02:22:33.684 --> 02:22:35.005]  Bill in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:22:35.025 --> 02:22:35.625]  Go ahead, Bill.
[02:22:37.788 --> 02:22:38.068]  Alex?
[02:22:38.308 --> 02:22:39.109]  Yes, go ahead, Bill.
[02:22:39.429 --> 02:22:40.590]  Oh, okay.
[02:22:40.690 --> 02:22:45.155]  Alex, first of all, I'd like for people to know everybody's got an answering machine.
[02:22:45.939 --> 02:22:51.164]  Try to find a King James Version of the Bible, which is the preserved Word of God.
[02:22:51.285 --> 02:22:56.450]  Take your NIVs and all that other crap and burn it!
[02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:58.112]  It's all written by man.
[02:22:58.132 --> 02:23:06.020]  Now, I always knew in my spirit that Romans 13 was going to be used on the people.
[02:23:06.980 --> 02:23:16.542]  And the Southern Baptists put out a newsletter many years ago that they're going to have to embrace Freemasonry.
[02:23:18.143 --> 02:23:21.224]  The Southern Baptists are completely run by Israel.
[02:23:21.284 --> 02:23:21.924]  Everybody knows it.
[02:23:22.964 --> 02:23:24.324]  Literally on the payroll.
[02:23:25.525 --> 02:23:27.825]  Well, this is what I've read.
[02:23:28.005 --> 02:23:29.186]  I've read the newsletter.
[02:23:31.860 --> 02:23:42.591]  Now Luke, if people would turn to Luke 22-36, Jesus told his disciples that they're going to need to go out and get a sword.
[02:23:43.552 --> 02:23:44.874]  Go and get a sword.
[02:23:44.894 --> 02:23:54.444]  And also in 1 Timothy 5-8, if a man doesn't provide for his own household, he's worse than an infidel.
[02:23:55.205 --> 02:23:55.485]  Now what
[02:24:12.116 --> 02:24:34.524]  Look, look, look, look, if these scumbag devil preachers are right, and these weak-minded ninny preachers are right, because a lot of them mean well, they're just little ninnies, their fathers weren't men, they're not men, they don't have any spirit in them, they don't know the truth when it knocks them upside the head, then they would know and they would understand that the founding fathers then were evil, because they stood up against the king
[02:24:35.370 --> 02:24:37.172]  I mean, I mean, they killed Jesus!
[02:24:37.692 --> 02:24:42.316]  They hung him up to a tree because he wouldn't grovel to the civil and the religious authority.
[02:24:43.857 --> 02:24:44.778]  Amen, he wouldn't.
[02:24:45.219 --> 02:24:47.360]  And, and, uh, with the silversmiths.
[02:24:47.981 --> 02:24:52.405]  They, they, they, oh yeah, yeah, they weren't buying their trinkets of Diana in that.
[02:24:53.208 --> 02:24:58.572]  You know, but anyway... That's right, Christ went in and overturned the money tables where they were manipulating.
[02:24:59.372 --> 02:25:04.936]  They made you buy a certain silver coin for about ten times what it was worth, because only that coin could buy the burnt offerings.
[02:25:05.156 --> 02:25:07.558]  And they were doing a bunch of occult stuff, Babylonian stuff.
[02:25:07.838 --> 02:25:14.743]  He went in and beat them upside the head with a cat or ninetail, and overturned stuff, and was kicking people over things, and basically went into a rage.
[02:25:14.783 --> 02:25:15.744]  We're supposed to get angry!
[02:25:15.944 --> 02:25:17.685]  I've had enough of it!
[02:25:18.186 --> 02:25:18.926]  Amen!
[02:25:19.066 --> 02:25:22.829]  But if there's too many Christians that are passive,
[02:25:23.410 --> 02:25:26.751]  Two pastos, not me, I'll never know, no, no.
[02:25:26.791 --> 02:25:28.972]  Well that's a bunch of baloney, hogwash.
[02:25:29.012 --> 02:25:30.853]  They're a bunch of cowardly scum!
[02:25:30.973 --> 02:25:32.434]  Amen, that's the truth.
[02:25:32.514 --> 02:25:36.515]  Look, the beginning of fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.
[02:25:36.555 --> 02:25:38.476]  Fear of the devil is the beginning of ignorance.
[02:25:39.076 --> 02:25:44.779]  And these people, they make excuses, they compromise, they compromise, they compromise, they compromise.
[02:25:45.479 --> 02:25:50.582]  And Christians of 100 years ago, 1,000 years ago, 1,500 years ago, weren't these cowardly people.
[02:25:50.602 --> 02:25:53.243]  Even though they went to the lions, they refused to submit.
[02:25:53.663 --> 02:25:56.985]  And the Caesars said, you better recant that.
[02:25:57.005 --> 02:25:58.505]  And they said no, they'd throw them to the lions.
[02:25:58.905 --> 02:26:00.186]  Now these Christians will recant.
[02:26:00.206 --> 02:26:02.187]  They'd say, well, I've got to do what the civil authority says.
[02:26:03.688 --> 02:26:04.168]  That's right.
[02:26:05.168 --> 02:26:08.350]  As I've said, everybody's got an answering machine.
[02:26:09.771 --> 02:26:14.493]  Try to find a King James Bible now, because they're scarce.
[02:26:15.612 --> 02:26:19.494]  Start preaching on your answering machine.
[02:26:19.554 --> 02:26:22.216]  Let them know who you're standing for.
[02:26:22.876 --> 02:26:28.059]  You know, give them John 3, 16.
[02:26:29.220 --> 02:26:35.164]  You know, tell them about the blood of Jesus Christ.
[02:26:35.204 --> 02:26:38.486]  They will come banging on my door just because of Jesus Christ.
[02:26:38.846 --> 02:26:40.427]  And they're going to hear some preaching.
[02:26:41.487 --> 02:26:42.388]  I hear you, my friend.
[02:26:42.428 --> 02:26:43.428]  You've got family.
[02:26:43.448 --> 02:26:44.129]  You've got to defend them.
[02:26:44.736 --> 02:26:45.396]  That's the thing.
[02:26:45.697 --> 02:26:47.197]  I'm willing to let the middle order kill me.
[02:26:47.217 --> 02:26:52.220]  I mean, I'm non-violent to that point, but I will not let them touch my wife or children.
[02:26:53.080 --> 02:26:54.541]  And you know what?
[02:26:54.601 --> 02:26:57.262]  I'm mad because I don't like that loss of control, folks.
[02:26:57.723 --> 02:26:59.183]  There is no governor.
[02:26:59.824 --> 02:27:00.684]  There's no blocking.
[02:27:00.704 --> 02:27:01.564]  There's no question.
[02:27:01.905 --> 02:27:02.885]  There's no debating.
[02:27:03.405 --> 02:27:06.027]  You mess with my family, I'm coming after you.
[02:27:06.627 --> 02:27:07.668]  Just get ready.
[02:27:08.388 --> 02:27:09.308]  I mean, just get ready.
[02:27:10.189 --> 02:27:11.469]  And see, I don't like that fact.
[02:27:11.570 --> 02:27:14.291]  I don't like the fact that they put me in a position
[02:27:14.967 --> 02:27:16.708]  They put all of us in a position.
[02:27:16.728 --> 02:27:21.030]  Because I know the New Order could care less about their dumb minions.
[02:27:21.671 --> 02:27:23.412]  I don't want to get in some fight with their people.
[02:27:24.772 --> 02:27:29.595]  But, you know, we're being put in a position where we're going to be forced to literally kick their butts.
[02:27:35.218 --> 02:27:36.139]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.599 --> 02:27:38.220]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:41.822]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.054 --> 02:27:49.158]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[02:27:49.418 --> 02:27:54.482]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[02:27:54.783 --> 02:27:59.427]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[02:27:59.767 --> 02:28:01.749]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[02:28:02.049 --> 02:28:07.894]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[02:28:08.254 --> 02:28:09.035]  And it works.
[02:28:09.456 --> 02:28:10.918]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[02:28:11.299 --> 02:28:12.320]  Now it's your turn.
[02:28:12.581 --> 02:28:14.925]  Today you can get a full bottle of Totinol.
[02:28:15.105 --> 02:28:19.372]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[02:28:19.673 --> 02:28:22.778]  See what Totinol can do for you and your confidence.
[02:28:23.129 --> 02:28:25.350]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[02:28:25.530 --> 02:28:27.592]  For your risk-free bottle of Tautenol, call 1-800-894-5152.
[02:28:27.612 --> 02:28:27.872]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[02:28:27.892 --> 02:28:29.533]  Tautenol is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.

[02:28:30.593 --> 02:28:30.913]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[02:28:44.864 --> 02:28:53.327]  Did you know that we ingest toxins and harsh chemicals every day from the foods and alcohol we consume, the water we drink, and the OTCs and prescription medications we take?
[02:28:53.607 --> 02:28:59.789]  Thankfully, our liver neutralizes the effects of these toxins and eliminates them from our bodies before they can do too much damage.
[02:29:00.089 --> 02:29:07.772]  The fact is, the liver performs over 500 vital functions in the body, from aiding digestion to removing toxins and maintaining good health.
[02:29:08.032 --> 02:29:18.276]  So why not give your liver the help it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula, prescribed by more than 200,000 doctors in over 76 countries.

[02:29:44.967 --> 02:29:48.568]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[02:29:48.808 --> 02:29:49.689]  Look no further!
[02:29:49.969 --> 02:29:52.550]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[02:29:52.970 --> 02:30:01.413]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:30:01.693 --> 02:30:01.973]  I think so.
[02:30:19.229 --> 02:30:19.509]  I'm good.
[02:30:46.986 --> 02:30:49.888]  Alright, let's go through your calls fast because I don't want to get into some more of this news here.
[02:30:51.989 --> 02:30:56.412]  By the way, again, it's normal to freak out and yell and scream and grind your teeth and hop up and down.
[02:30:57.112 --> 02:31:00.734]  That's how you used to get ready, you know, when 10,000 guys were coming against your 10,000.
[02:31:01.195 --> 02:31:09.860]  Hop up and down, get yourself fired up, get all the juices flowing so you can hack some arms off and, you know, take your hammer to their head.
[02:31:11.957 --> 02:31:14.238]  You gotta get fired up like that every day just to break your conditioning.
[02:31:14.538 --> 02:31:21.299]  Break all the programming that loads you into being, you know, weak and impotent and just lethargically taking it.
[02:31:22.339 --> 02:31:26.000]  I'm telling you, the answer to this is just literally getting angry first.
[02:31:26.460 --> 02:31:28.961]  Literally getting out of your comfort zone.
[02:31:29.781 --> 02:31:37.523]  And just start being disgusted with the filthy, degenerate, lice-ridden government and all the parasites feeding on us.
[02:31:37.543 --> 02:31:38.483]  It makes me sick!
[02:31:39.753 --> 02:31:43.336]  Makes me sick to be an adult and have all these parasites hanging off of me.
[02:31:43.836 --> 02:31:50.521]  And to see him running around engaging in every crime you can imagine while buying PSAs with our money, telling us how good they are.
[02:31:50.881 --> 02:31:51.902]  You make me sick!
[02:31:54.544 --> 02:31:56.165]  Carl in Montreal, Canada.
[02:31:56.185 --> 02:31:56.786]  You're on the air.
[02:31:57.126 --> 02:31:59.948]  Hey, um, what I have to say has to do with the last caller.
[02:31:59.968 --> 02:32:01.029]  I sort of agree with him.
[02:32:01.569 --> 02:32:02.790]  And Romans 13.
[02:32:03.230 --> 02:32:08.114]  I believe Romans 13 is totally misused in order to, you know, prop up
[02:32:08.766 --> 02:32:15.509]  Evil regimes, um, like there was an instance in the Bible where Peter was put in jail, and they told him to stop preaching.
[02:32:15.529 --> 02:32:22.872]  And he was released, you know, the prison doors were open, and he came out and he said that we must obey God as ruler rather than men.
[02:32:22.892 --> 02:32:25.073]  I believe that God comes first.
[02:32:25.093 --> 02:32:29.475]  And the people in the lion's den, the people on the furnace, look, the whole Bible
[02:32:30.443 --> 02:32:35.592]  And again, even if you're an atheist, folks, they're using this on 80% of the public, 82% say they're Christians.
[02:32:35.632 --> 02:32:38.377]  So they tell them, Jesus says lay down to Hitler.
[02:32:38.737 --> 02:32:40.340]  Jesus says lay down to Stalin.
[02:32:40.681 --> 02:32:43.446]  Jesus says to tan your guns in and give us your children.
[02:32:44.148 --> 02:32:45.849]  And that is not what the Bible says.
[02:32:45.889 --> 02:32:47.229]  That's why we're having this debate.
[02:32:47.569 --> 02:33:05.937]  Alex, throughout the Bible there were people, righteous people like Noah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, a small minority of people who stood up against the majority, spoke out for what is right, and those people were ridiculed, put to death, called false prophets by these false teachers in ancient Israel, and they were ridiculed.
[02:33:06.277 --> 02:33:08.978]  And again, for those who just joined us, the reason we're having this discussion
[02:33:09.753 --> 02:33:19.896]  Right now, is because the Feds have recruited 26,000 preachers to preach in the pulpits about submission to government, and I appreciate your call, sir, and that's the big problem here.
[02:33:21.077 --> 02:33:28.619]  Regardless of the secret police, regardless of the internal passports they're now announcing, you gotta have a passport to go to a park, or drive your car, or fly a plane, or whatever.
[02:33:29.499 --> 02:33:35.341]  Chertoff announced yesterday on CNN, you know, spy satellites, Pentagon watching us, they're already in control, folks, now they're just announcing it.
[02:33:36.113 --> 02:33:36.573]  All of that!
[02:33:36.693 --> 02:33:42.296]  Imagine the Fed secretly recruiting the preachers to preach from the pulpits to submit.
[02:33:42.416 --> 02:33:45.237]  I mean, that is propaganda on steroids.
[02:33:45.497 --> 02:33:57.922]  Then you find out there's White House funded and controlled neocon group focusing on Christian women, run by Woolsey and others, saying we need to start killing Americans and set up a dictatorship and kill all the Arabs.
[02:34:01.184 --> 02:34:04.245]  You see, this is all for the American people, folks,
[02:34:06.101 --> 02:34:06.602]  And you wait.
[02:34:06.662 --> 02:34:11.108]  I mean, Tony Snow's leaving, Rove just left, all this stuff's happening, Bush is in trouble.
[02:34:11.449 --> 02:34:12.390]  But he's a puppet.
[02:34:12.610 --> 02:34:14.693]  These new powers, Hillary's gonna have!
[02:34:15.995 --> 02:34:17.317]  Don't you understand that?
[02:34:18.458 --> 02:34:20.101]  Don't you understand what we're in for?
[02:34:21.511 --> 02:34:22.452]  I've studied history.
[02:34:22.492 --> 02:34:24.534]  These people, I don't know how else to say it.
[02:34:24.554 --> 02:34:26.455]  They're cold-blooded killers.
[02:34:26.495 --> 02:34:27.556]  They're coming for us.
[02:34:28.257 --> 02:34:41.488]  Only by getting mad, getting informed, and waking others up, and standing up and yelling and screaming at your church, and putting out flyers, and websites, and business cards with Infowars.com, or your own website, or start your own deal.
[02:34:41.548 --> 02:34:42.429]  I don't care, man.
[02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:44.171]  Make copies of my films, other films.
[02:34:44.771 --> 02:34:46.853]  I've been so busy today, I haven't even hardly plugged sponsors.
[02:34:46.873 --> 02:34:49.035]  I haven't plugged my films, but like three times this whole week.
[02:34:50.888 --> 02:34:52.068]  We'll go back to your calls here in a minute.
[02:34:52.088 --> 02:34:56.350]  I'm going to be on the radio 4 to 6 p.m., God willing, this Sunday.
[02:34:58.610 --> 02:34:59.131]  Syndicated.
[02:34:59.231 --> 02:35:01.411]  You can listen to it on this radio, 590 KLBJ.
[02:35:01.851 --> 02:35:04.352]  Fine stations like KCXL and Kansas City are picking it up.
[02:35:04.372 --> 02:35:04.952]  We're very thankful.
[02:35:05.313 --> 02:35:06.913]  Sunshine Network, upstate New York.
[02:35:08.213 --> 02:35:11.114]  And Lundgren Station out in California is picking it up.
[02:35:11.134 --> 02:35:13.295]  There's a new station picking up the weekday show.
[02:35:13.315 --> 02:35:15.196]  I don't know what's its call letters.
[02:35:15.236 --> 02:35:15.936]  It just started.
[02:35:16.596 --> 02:35:19.377]  It's 1330, covers most of Austin, but it's in Cameron.
[02:35:20.976 --> 02:35:21.776]  So that's exciting.
[02:35:21.836 --> 02:35:22.696]  I want other affiliates.
[02:35:22.716 --> 02:35:24.897]  We've got like 50-something affiliates.
[02:35:25.137 --> 02:35:26.117]  It's always going up and down.
[02:35:26.177 --> 02:35:27.297]  I don't know how many there are.
[02:35:28.498 --> 02:35:29.898]  I know it's grown the last few months.
[02:35:29.978 --> 02:35:30.918]  It doesn't even matter.
[02:35:31.098 --> 02:35:31.958]  And here's another thing.
[02:35:33.159 --> 02:35:34.839]  I'm just an average person, folks.
[02:35:34.879 --> 02:35:35.719]  This is not an act.
[02:35:35.739 --> 02:35:36.459]  This is who I am.
[02:35:37.219 --> 02:35:37.479]  Okay?
[02:35:37.519 --> 02:35:39.140]  I mean, I am a crazy hillbilly.
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:40.540]  I mean, there's no doubting it.
[02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:42.981]  I mean, I am what I am, folks.
[02:35:47.276 --> 02:35:50.740]  People say, well, you need to do a better job at this, or be more calm at that.
[02:35:51.140 --> 02:35:53.463]  Look, man, it's not my job to fix everything.
[02:35:53.703 --> 02:35:55.265]  It's not my job to be perfect.
[02:35:55.345 --> 02:35:55.905]  I'm not!
[02:35:56.947 --> 02:35:58.468]  That's why I'm not, okay?
[02:35:59.289 --> 02:36:04.475]  See, people take my aggression and people take my will as some type of arrogance.
[02:36:04.515 --> 02:36:05.556]  I'm the opposite of arrogant.
[02:36:05.576 --> 02:36:07.218]  I've got a pretty low image of myself.
[02:36:08.047 --> 02:36:13.228]  And that's what freaks me out so bad, is that I see these yuppies who don't know anything, and they are so arrogant, man.
[02:36:13.488 --> 02:36:15.009]  They think they've got it all figured out.
[02:36:15.329 --> 02:36:17.429]  And I've just discovered the mysteries of the universe.
[02:36:17.529 --> 02:36:22.811]  I've just discovered they're there, and that I'll never know one billionth of them.
[02:36:22.831 --> 02:36:24.091]  I mean, it's German scientists.
[02:36:24.131 --> 02:36:25.171]  It's always German scientists.
[02:36:25.492 --> 02:36:27.532]  It's accelerated light, past light speed.
[02:36:29.333 --> 02:36:32.113]  They're discovering millions of new planets every month.
[02:36:32.213 --> 02:36:34.694]  It's just unbelievable, all of the beauty.
[02:36:35.522 --> 02:36:36.863]  All of the good things in life.
[02:36:37.143 --> 02:36:38.123]  All of the blessings.
[02:36:38.364 --> 02:36:39.684]  I am thankful and happy.
[02:36:40.245 --> 02:36:42.446]  See, so many yuppies and others don't think they know it all.
[02:36:42.466 --> 02:36:44.367]  They're just like, I got a nice house, nice car.
[02:36:44.427 --> 02:36:46.888]  I don't like how the world's going, but what can I do about it?
[02:36:46.948 --> 02:36:48.029]  And you know what?
[02:36:48.069 --> 02:36:49.609]  I'm kind of thankful for how life is.
[02:36:49.730 --> 02:36:50.370]  Exactly!
[02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:51.831]  Life is good!
[02:36:52.671 --> 02:36:54.392]  We're trying to protect all of that.
[02:36:54.452 --> 02:36:59.495]  I mean, I discovered the people running our government killed 200 million people.
[02:36:59.535 --> 02:37:01.896]  Their daddies, their mommies, their granddaddies.
[02:37:03.451 --> 02:37:07.333]  I learned that they want to kill us, and now they're bragging about it in mainstream news!
[02:37:09.594 --> 02:37:10.975]  And I mean, they want to come in?
[02:37:10.995 --> 02:37:13.176]  You think 3,000 people is where they're going to stop?
[02:37:14.397 --> 02:37:16.878]  You think 3,000 lives means anything to these killers?
[02:37:18.479 --> 02:37:19.339]  Like Paris says?
[02:37:19.359 --> 02:37:24.061]  3 billion doesn't mean anything!
[02:37:25.262 --> 02:37:27.823]  Once you're ready to kill one person, why not kill a million?
[02:37:28.103 --> 02:37:29.024]  Why not kill a billion?
[02:37:31.044 --> 02:37:34.526]  They got race-specific bioweapons that can kill every person on Earth right now.
[02:37:35.326 --> 02:37:36.747]  They had them 25 years ago.
[02:37:37.747 --> 02:37:39.108]  They got stuff that'll kill blacks.
[02:37:39.148 --> 02:37:41.129]  They got stuff that'll kill certain derivations of whites.
[02:37:41.389 --> 02:37:44.030]  They got stuff that'll kill certain varieties of Central Asians.
[02:37:44.871 --> 02:37:46.892]  They got varieties that'll kill Southeast Asians.
[02:37:50.914 --> 02:37:51.854]  And they're just waiting.
[02:37:52.434 --> 02:37:55.616]  As soon as they think they can do it in orderly fashion, they're gonna release it on us.
[02:37:56.871 --> 02:38:01.795]  God, I just want my children to grow up and be able to have good lives and get married themselves and have families.
[02:38:02.956 --> 02:38:04.938]  I want to take grandchildren fishing someday.
[02:38:05.098 --> 02:38:08.441]  I just want to go have picnics in the Texas Hill Country.
[02:38:08.461 --> 02:38:12.104]  I want to get a little ranch someday and, you know, have a couple horses.
[02:38:13.345 --> 02:38:17.608]  I want to, you know, pull out an easel and do some watercolors sometime.
[02:38:17.648 --> 02:38:20.510]  I want to go scuba diving in the Caribbean.
[02:38:20.571 --> 02:38:25.715]  I want to... I'd probably just own some business or something and just be
[02:38:26.647 --> 02:38:28.988]  Lord knows what I'd be doing as some salesman.
[02:38:29.048 --> 02:38:30.468]  I mean, I just want to live my life.
[02:38:31.848 --> 02:38:32.929]  I just want to have friends.
[02:38:35.910 --> 02:38:36.650]  But I can't.
[02:38:37.150 --> 02:38:47.633]  There is a pack of murdering scum killing our country right in front of us with a bunch of third world people laughing at us as we go to hell in a handbasket.
[02:38:49.193 --> 02:38:51.574]  Our churches are run by intelligence agencies.
[02:38:52.529 --> 02:38:56.672]  Our children are being brainwashed, forced drugged, having illegal drugs pushed on them.
[02:38:56.992 --> 02:38:58.172]  Everything's unraveling.
[02:39:01.815 --> 02:39:07.958]  I just hope you'll go to PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com and not just, just get TerrorStorm, the final cut, the new edition.
[02:39:08.218 --> 02:39:13.141]  Get Loose Change, second edition, America Freedom to Fascism, Riddles in Stone, The Hermetic Code.
[02:39:14.102 --> 02:39:19.445]  These are the materials you need to wake people up, and yes, it's fuel in our gas tank.
[02:39:20.615 --> 02:39:22.239]  So we can do more around here.
[02:39:22.259 --> 02:39:26.410]  Frankly, I'm so sick of plugging it, but it's such a big part of the solution.
[02:39:26.891 --> 02:39:27.793]  I am here plugging it.
[02:39:27.833 --> 02:39:29.056]  Infowars.com or 888.
[02:39:30.979 --> 02:39:31.079]  253-3139.
[02:39:31.099 --> 02:39:34.922]  888-253-3139 or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:39:34.942 --> 02:39:39.205]  You get a 15-cent a day membership.
[02:39:39.225 --> 02:39:44.009]  If you have a membership, start using it to download and burn the films and TV shows and special reports to disk.
[02:39:44.409 --> 02:39:45.570]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:39:46.551 --> 02:39:53.255]  Two other sponsors here I want to tell you about that we're going to go to your calls as quickly as possible.
[02:39:54.697 --> 02:39:56.558]  One of them is eFoods Direct.
[02:39:58.348 --> 02:40:06.190]  They are our biggest and most important sponsor, and they are the oldest and most long continually operating storable foods company in the country.
[02:40:06.210 --> 02:40:07.930]  26 years, Steve Schenck.
[02:40:08.430 --> 02:40:13.171]  This is where I've gotten my storable foods two of the four times, the latest batch I got from them, highest quality.
[02:40:13.451 --> 02:40:19.072]  They've got a two month supply for one person that's so dirt cheap you can't believe it, and we have it right here at the office.
[02:40:19.092 --> 02:40:21.313]  It is of the highest quality, and it's
[02:40:22.179 --> 02:40:26.061]  Almost double the nutrition you need for an average sized person in each meal.
[02:40:26.121 --> 02:40:28.442]  So it's really double the amount of meals they claim it is.
[02:40:29.783 --> 02:40:30.403]  Give them a call.
[02:40:30.423 --> 02:40:30.823]  Get that.
[02:40:30.843 --> 02:40:31.564]  Get a brochure.
[02:40:31.604 --> 02:40:32.584]  Get a year's supply.
[02:40:32.905 --> 02:40:35.306]  And yeah, if you don't have guns, get them.
[02:40:35.326 --> 02:40:37.507]  If you don't know how to use them, better take a safety class.
[02:40:38.267 --> 02:40:40.028]  And just have a revolver.
[02:40:40.168 --> 02:40:41.609]  It's simple for new people.
[02:40:41.689 --> 02:40:42.529]  Have a shotgun.
[02:40:42.890 --> 02:40:44.090]  Have them stowed properly.
[02:40:46.835 --> 02:40:48.576]  If it ever comes to it, don't get on the truck, folks.
[02:40:48.596 --> 02:40:49.436]  That's all I can tell you.
[02:40:49.916 --> 02:40:51.037]  Don't let them have their way with you.
[02:40:51.117 --> 02:40:52.678]  And believe me, they do want to have their way with you.
[02:40:53.238 --> 02:40:55.599]  They're gang member scum in our military predominantly now.
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:40:58.740]  I'm sad to have to tell you that.
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:40:58.820]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:01.942]  1-800-409-5633 is the eFoodsDirect number.
[02:41:02.002 --> 02:41:03.242]  Or eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:41:03.262 --> 02:41:04.543]  There's a banner on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:41:04.703 --> 02:41:06.323]  And then, of course, there's InnerFood.
[02:41:16.152 --> 02:41:29.438]  If you go to PrisonPlanet.com and click on the InterFood banner, you get an automatic 10% off on what's already discounted on their NutriCafe coffee, on their InterFood, on their coconut milk powder, on all of it.
[02:41:29.498 --> 02:41:30.138]  Huge discounts.
[02:41:30.158 --> 02:41:32.599]  When you get bulk deals, you get 20% on top of that.
[02:41:34.099 --> 02:41:34.699]  Yeah, hey there Alex.
[02:41:34.719 --> 02:41:35.280]  Godspeed to you, man.
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:08.422]  I just want to tell you that you know that we appreciate what you're doing, and it is a sacrifice.
[02:42:08.542 --> 02:42:09.883]  I tell you, it is a sacrifice.
[02:42:10.083 --> 02:42:10.563]  Well, it's not.
[02:42:10.603 --> 02:42:16.066]  I mean, look, I can't help myself, and I've been blessed for what I do, and I'm honored, and it's, you know, it's all that stuff.
[02:42:16.086 --> 02:42:17.747]  But I'm just saying, number one, it's not about me.
[02:42:18.007 --> 02:42:20.048]  Number two, I know the message isn't perfect, okay?
[02:42:20.409 --> 02:42:21.609]  I just don't know what to do.
[02:42:21.649 --> 02:42:26.792]  I mean, we got people openly saying they want to kill us, and they're a bunch of scum, and I just blow up!
[02:42:26.872 --> 02:42:27.793]  I'm tired of them!
[02:42:28.013 --> 02:42:28.333]  Oh, yeah.
[02:42:28.773 --> 02:42:29.874]  Hey, I don't blame you, Alex.
[02:42:29.914 --> 02:42:31.695]  I've been looking at this stuff now for 15 years.
[02:42:32.805 --> 02:42:34.086]  I know what you're talking about.
[02:42:34.126 --> 02:42:36.788]  That's why I listen to you, because I know you're putting out the truth.
[02:42:36.808 --> 02:42:39.330]  You and there's a precious few other people out there.
[02:42:39.350 --> 02:42:41.471]  I just know they get away with so much evil, too, man.
[02:42:41.511 --> 02:42:43.613]  I'm tired of them hurting innocent, weak people.
[02:42:43.673 --> 02:42:46.115]  I just want to... Well, you know what I want.
[02:42:46.375 --> 02:42:46.735]  Yeah.
[02:42:47.236 --> 02:42:52.960]  But I wanted to agree with the previous two callers, too, especially the guy in Ohio that mentioned getting the King James Bible.
[02:42:53.380 --> 02:42:58.384]  And the passage in Romans 13 seems to me that what that's talking about is lawful rulers.
[02:42:58.464 --> 02:42:59.925]  It doesn't mean you have to obey
[02:43:00.635 --> 02:43:03.116]  People that are doing evil type stuff.
[02:43:05.017 --> 02:43:08.858]  Paul is speaking of lawful rulers, good rulers there.
[02:43:09.119 --> 02:43:11.339]  So I wanted to mention that.
[02:43:11.379 --> 02:43:13.940]  But then I had three questions for you.
[02:43:14.901 --> 02:43:17.422]  First of all, these are kind of general information.
[02:43:18.244 --> 02:43:21.346]  Um, you had mentioned about two countries the U.S.
[02:43:21.406 --> 02:43:22.587]  troops were in before 9-11.
[02:43:22.727 --> 02:43:27.251]  I think one of them you mentioned was Tajikistan... And Uzbekistan.
[02:43:27.471 --> 02:43:28.251]  Man, they were in more.
[02:43:28.331 --> 02:43:29.172]  I just mentioned those two.
[02:43:29.192 --> 02:43:30.673]  They were in four countries.
[02:43:31.454 --> 02:43:31.894]  Oh, okay.
[02:43:31.974 --> 02:43:33.915]  Okay, so... They were in Pakistan, too.
[02:43:34.436 --> 02:43:35.136]  I'm sorry, say again?
[02:43:35.657 --> 02:43:36.737]  They were in Pakistan, too.
[02:43:37.158 --> 02:43:39.940]  Okay, Pakistan and Tajikistan and Uzbekistan?
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:40.280]  Yes.
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:41.140]  Okay.
[02:43:41.501 --> 02:43:43.022]  And then, was that a, um...
[02:43:43.886 --> 02:44:06.529]  a lie about uh... when they were talking about down in new orleans they were said the people were firing on the rescue helicopters and that was the excuse he has grabbed the guns it was all lies turned out and and and as we predicted because firemen had called in and told us the cops just went nuts and shot other cops and also shot people trying to walk out they have bridges that were going out of the city
[02:44:06.989 --> 02:44:12.950]  Yeah, I remember hearing that about like the National Guard or something was preventing people from crossing one bridge.
[02:44:12.990 --> 02:44:13.530]  Was that correct?
[02:44:13.550 --> 02:44:15.130]  The National Guard and cops, yeah.
[02:44:15.651 --> 02:44:19.111]  And they were shooting cops trying to get out and then some cops went to prison over that.
[02:44:20.071 --> 02:44:34.914]  Okay, and then the condition, the last question was concerning the Daniel, when Musharraf, you had mentioned that Musharraf said that, who was it, the CIA or whoever that murdered Daniel Pearl?
[02:44:35.114 --> 02:44:35.354]  Yes.
[02:44:36.129 --> 02:44:44.042]  Do you know where Musharraf was at when he came over here and made the trip a year or so ago?
[02:44:44.063 --> 02:44:45.425]  I don't remember now.
[02:44:50.466 --> 02:44:50.826]  U.S.
[02:44:50.907 --> 02:44:55.248]  papers, MSNBC, British papers, that 44,000 U.S.
[02:44:55.648 --> 02:45:16.234]  troops were massed in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Pakistan, and another 18,000 British troops were massed in the months before, and Bush had the launch order to attack Afghanistan on his desk on 9-10, the day before 9-11, and the aircraft carriers were lined up with the jets fueled.
[02:45:17.213 --> 02:45:18.234]  Okay, I see.
[02:45:18.675 --> 02:45:23.719]  And, but Musharraf, what organization, did he say, was it the CIA that murdered Daniel Pearl, or who was it?
[02:45:23.739 --> 02:45:24.740]  I don't remember who said that.
[02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:26.943]  I remember a prominent individual over there said that right now.
[02:45:27.363 --> 02:45:27.863]  I don't remember.
[02:45:28.464 --> 02:45:28.704]  Okay.
[02:45:28.945 --> 02:45:29.585]  Alright, that's cool.
[02:45:29.865 --> 02:45:33.008]  Well, hey, like I said, Alex, thanks for what you do.
[02:45:33.069 --> 02:45:34.430]  We do appreciate you.
[02:45:34.790 --> 02:45:35.251]  Thank you.
[02:45:35.431 --> 02:45:36.832]  Yeah, what you said rings a bell.
[02:45:37.453 --> 02:45:40.115]  My memory is not photographic.
[02:45:40.175 --> 02:45:41.537]  About ten years ago it was.
[02:45:43.058 --> 02:45:44.738]  You know, as you get older, this doesn't work anymore.
[02:45:44.758 --> 02:45:48.439]  In fact, at 30, that's when screaming massive brain cells die back every day.
[02:45:48.459 --> 02:45:53.441]  And I'm still pretty smart, but I'm not as smart as I was 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago.
[02:45:53.461 --> 02:45:54.681]  That is sharp.
[02:45:55.141 --> 02:45:57.522]  I've got more knowledge and a little more wisdom, not much.
[02:45:59.442 --> 02:46:00.663]  But used to, I could have pulled that up.
[02:46:00.703 --> 02:46:01.743]  It does ring a bell.
[02:46:01.783 --> 02:46:03.844]  As soon as I'm off air, I'll remember exactly who said it.
[02:46:05.964 --> 02:46:09.985]  I think Musharraf did is like some shot across the bowel like a year ago.
[02:46:10.585 --> 02:46:12.406]  And I want to say it was in British papers.
[02:46:13.712 --> 02:46:15.614]  I don't want to say that's the case.
[02:46:15.674 --> 02:46:20.017]  My memory tells me that, but then I have a little... I don't remember the details, so I don't want to agree with you.
[02:46:22.158 --> 02:46:24.320]  Or be able to say I'm giving you good info is my point.
[02:46:28.603 --> 02:46:35.108]  It's like a couple days ago I could remember that major metropolitan police departments have a policy of not hiring cops of above 100 IQ.
[02:46:36.749 --> 02:46:40.172]  And above 100 is above average.
[02:46:40.372 --> 02:46:41.513]  You've got to be below average.
[02:46:42.506 --> 02:46:43.167]  Or at average.
[02:46:43.507 --> 02:46:48.470]  And some have even lower IQ standards, like internal policies and lawsuits have come out.
[02:46:49.151 --> 02:46:54.074]  Well, when I actually now look these up and have my memory refreshed, my memory was correct from like six, seven years ago when I first learned of it.
[02:46:54.094 --> 02:46:55.955]  I couldn't believe it when I first heard it by a talk show host.
[02:46:57.296 --> 02:47:00.759]  But people on the Prison Planet board did find all the articles, or a bunch of them, and post them.
[02:47:01.219 --> 02:47:05.382]  Some departments actually want even, you know, they want lower, but they'll take up to 100.
[02:47:07.176 --> 02:47:08.876]  And they just tell them, no, you're too smart.
[02:47:09.256 --> 02:47:10.637]  We want people that'll do what they're told.
[02:47:10.897 --> 02:47:14.998]  Because, look, I mean, really, if you were a good police department, you'd want smart people.
[02:47:15.798 --> 02:47:17.778]  But if you're doing evil, you want morons.
[02:47:17.878 --> 02:47:21.659]  I mean, look, I've talked to cops, folks, and there's nobody home, a lot of them.
[02:47:22.179 --> 02:47:23.199]  Now, other ones are smart.
[02:47:23.679 --> 02:47:24.100]  You can tell.
[02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:25.900]  You can look in somebody's eyes and tell they're smart.
[02:47:26.500 --> 02:47:28.861]  And I'm just tired of dim-eyed people.
[02:47:29.641 --> 02:47:31.061]  And I'm not knocking you.
[02:47:31.101 --> 02:47:32.761]  I mean, no, I'm sorry you're stupid.
[02:47:33.642 --> 02:47:35.762]  But just please, just admit you're an idiot.
[02:47:37.578 --> 02:47:39.438]  Just leave me alone!
[02:47:39.458 --> 02:47:43.639]  I mean, you should be shoveling manure!
[02:47:44.819 --> 02:47:46.100]  You should be digging ditches!
[02:47:46.140 --> 02:47:47.920]  You shouldn't be out messing with people!
[02:47:48.900 --> 02:47:53.961]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jodi in Ohio.
[02:47:54.001 --> 02:47:55.041]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:47:55.061 --> 02:47:56.682]  Hi Alex.
[02:47:56.762 --> 02:47:57.082]  Hi.
[02:47:58.002 --> 02:48:00.422]  I just have one question for you.
[02:48:01.002 --> 02:48:02.783]  Your new movie, Endgames, is coming out?
[02:48:03.083 --> 02:48:03.903]  Yes.
[02:48:03.983 --> 02:48:04.723]  When is that coming out?
[02:48:06.554 --> 02:48:07.256]  Mid-October.
[02:48:07.717 --> 02:48:08.198]  Mid-October?
[02:48:08.579 --> 02:48:10.643]  Okay, and I just have some other stuff to tell you about.
[02:48:10.663 --> 02:48:17.138]  I had gotten a job here in Ohio, and the whole paycheck thing, talking about the cashless society and all that.
[02:48:17.938 --> 02:48:18.739]  They were paying money.
[02:48:19.219 --> 02:48:21.321]  And they tried to make you take automatic transfer?
[02:48:21.822 --> 02:48:24.064]  Yeah, they made me... Stay there, stay there, stay there.
[02:48:24.084 --> 02:48:25.945]  We're going to come back and talk to you on the other side, Jodi.
[02:48:26.426 --> 02:48:27.947]  We're going to talk to Steve and Tim and others.
[02:48:28.508 --> 02:48:39.318]  This article, where one of the top neocons says, declare martial law, kill anybody that disagrees with Bush, make him world dictator, is on PrisonPlanet.com, and I want this story to get out to everybody.
[02:48:39.638 --> 02:48:40.819]  This story is important.
[02:48:47.896 --> 02:48:53.366]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:53.727 --> 02:49:01.340]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.051 --> 02:49:09.096]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.496 --> 02:49:20.923]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.243 --> 02:49:24.866]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.206 --> 02:49:27.147]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.467 --> 02:49:31.310]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:16.949 --> 02:50:20.451]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[02:50:44.085 --> 02:50:48.647]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:50:49.048 --> 02:50:51.989]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:50:52.309 --> 02:50:54.871]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:50:55.231 --> 02:51:00.053]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:51:00.434 --> 02:51:05.796]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:51:06.116 --> 02:51:09.078]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:51:09.258 --> 02:51:09.819]  We're good to go.
[02:51:32.660 --> 02:51:38.124]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:51:38.144 --> 02:51:38.705]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:51:38.745 --> 02:51:40.826]  Some folks are born silver spoon in the hand!
[02:51:59.424 --> 02:52:04.094]  Tell me folks, the bond makes the way to fly.
[02:52:04.795 --> 02:52:06.859]  The red, white, and blue.
[02:52:07.440 --> 02:52:09.024]  The red, white, and blue.
[02:52:09.841 --> 02:52:10.262]  Welcome back.
[02:52:10.302 --> 02:52:16.227]  The end game is going to be of course shown in September.
[02:52:34.924 --> 02:52:35.705]  9th in New York.
[02:52:36.686 --> 02:52:41.833]  I think they're charging for it, but that goes to the Feel Good Foundation, firefighters and police.
[02:52:42.954 --> 02:52:43.515]  Right on.
[02:52:45.217 --> 02:52:50.104]  We are going to be charging for you to see it at the Alamo Draft House.
[02:52:51.175 --> 02:52:53.195]  September 4th, 5th, 6th, and the 17th.
[02:52:54.176 --> 02:52:56.096]  Every showing we've ever had is sold out there.
[02:52:56.696 --> 02:52:57.816]  And you always wait until the end.
[02:52:57.836 --> 02:53:04.038]  You better go to Infowars.com, to the big banner, or PrisonPlanet.com, the banner, and link through, and get tickets for that engagement.
[02:53:04.418 --> 02:53:05.278]  I hope to see you there.
[02:53:05.318 --> 02:53:06.698]  I'll be giving speeches at each event.
[02:53:06.978 --> 02:53:08.239]  And Endgame is my best work.
[02:53:08.319 --> 02:53:11.399]  I mean, it's... it's... it's done now.
[02:53:11.879 --> 02:53:12.679]  The film is done.
[02:53:12.699 --> 02:53:14.500]  Now I'm working on the cover and a bunch of other stuff.
[02:53:15.460 --> 02:53:16.600]  And, uh, we completed it.
[02:53:16.620 --> 02:53:18.881]  It's 99.9% done.
[02:53:18.901 --> 02:53:19.261]  We're still...
[02:53:21.271 --> 02:53:22.212]  Yes, I was telling you about that.
[02:53:22.232 --> 02:53:26.315]  They wanted me to take the debit card as my form of a paycheck.
[02:53:51.093 --> 02:53:55.577]  And I didn't want to do it, so I didn't, obviously, stay with the job.
[02:53:57.979 --> 02:54:04.664]  But any other form of, like, I had to collect unemployment and stuff like that, too, and all of that, here in the state of Ohio, is all now on debit cards.
[02:54:04.704 --> 02:54:09.248]  You can't get an actual... So you lost the job because they wouldn't give you a check?
[02:54:09.628 --> 02:54:19.937]  Well, I didn't stay with the job myself, because I didn't feel it was right that they could dictate my money, or that any bank could dictate my money on what I was receiving, because I don't know how much
[02:54:20.618 --> 02:54:21.038]  Exactly.
[02:54:21.078 --> 02:54:21.638]  Here's the deal.
[02:54:21.819 --> 02:54:23.139]  Use cash or lose it.
[02:54:25.940 --> 02:54:37.905]  That doesn't mean that everything has to be cash, but it does mean that a lot of it needs to be that you need to use cash.
[02:54:38.185 --> 02:54:41.846]  I just had an ISDN shutdown, guys, so you can... Oh, it's back now.
[02:54:41.886 --> 02:54:43.287]  Are we still on air there?
[02:54:44.927 --> 02:54:45.307]  Oh, okay.
[02:54:45.408 --> 02:54:46.568]  I had to take my headphones off.
[02:54:46.588 --> 02:54:47.948]  That just about blew my eardrums out.
[02:54:48.269 --> 02:54:49.109]  Did you hear that on air?
[02:54:50.337 --> 02:54:50.757]  Oh, okay.
[02:54:51.198 --> 02:54:51.818]  Always fun.
[02:54:52.599 --> 02:54:54.740]  Probably some ISDN connecting going on up there.
[02:54:55.120 --> 02:54:56.541]  And that's probably what did it.
[02:54:56.581 --> 02:54:57.362]  Jodi, you still there?
[02:54:57.762 --> 02:54:57.942]  Yes.
[02:54:58.342 --> 02:54:58.822]  Okay, sorry.
[02:54:59.043 --> 02:55:00.183]  My ear drums just got blown out.
[02:55:00.403 --> 02:55:00.984]  What were you saying?
[02:55:01.624 --> 02:55:07.228]  I was saying that I didn't take the job because of the fact that I think I went for my orientation.
[02:55:07.768 --> 02:55:09.009]  And that was it, because she told me.
[02:55:09.491 --> 02:55:17.153]  That it was going to be through a debit card, and I was like, well, I'd rather, like you said, with the whole cash thing, I'd rather have cash to know how much I'm getting.
[02:55:17.173 --> 02:55:20.293]  So they just said, we will not issue you a check, it's got to be this debit card.
[02:55:20.493 --> 02:55:22.294]  Yep, either debit or direct deposit.
[02:55:23.414 --> 02:55:31.656]  Well again, it's the great control that that brings over you into the system, and it makes it where you have to have that financial institution.
[02:55:31.676 --> 02:55:36.117]  And again, the people at the place where you work probably aren't bad.
[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:39.041]  It's just corporate governance and policy.
[02:55:39.081 --> 02:55:40.021]  Thanks for the call, Jody.
[02:55:41.442 --> 02:55:43.002]  Tim in L.A., real fast, go ahead.
[02:55:45.683 --> 02:55:46.024]  Hello?
[02:55:46.184 --> 02:55:47.004]  Yeah, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:55:47.844 --> 02:55:48.745]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[02:55:48.865 --> 02:55:49.305]  Good.
[02:55:51.006 --> 02:56:02.590]  I heard you on another radio show, and it was great, actually, it was a Mike Moyes show, and on the show he brings up the comments about the four, I guess, the four boxes.
[02:56:04.952 --> 02:56:13.114]  Which is, um, the ballot box... The ballot box, the jury box, the grand jury box, and the cartridge box.
[02:56:15.155 --> 02:56:20.996]  I asked him, and he really couldn't give me an answer, and I'd like to ask you is, when should we start using the ammo box?
[02:56:21.196 --> 02:56:22.737]  When they're running around with FEMA trucks.
[02:56:23.137 --> 02:56:23.877]  God bless you all.
[02:56:24.777 --> 02:56:29.438]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[02:56:35.052 --> 02:56:35.289]  Hello!
