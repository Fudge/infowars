[00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.613]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.253 --> 00:00:11.074]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.815 --> 00:00:13.756]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.776 --> 00:00:17.138]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.721]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.163 --> 00:00:31.028]  Alright, we've got, whatever indicator shows, another stage fear-mongering terror event.
[00:00:32.831 --> 00:00:36.114]  In Piccadilly Circus in London, England.
[00:00:37.535 --> 00:00:38.616]  Jolly old England.
[00:00:39.417 --> 00:00:43.880]  We'll be going over the latest developments there for you today.
[00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:48.244]  We're also going to have open phones on this Friday edition.
[00:00:48.925 --> 00:00:55.991]  But last night and this morning, getting ready for the show, I, no exaggeration, have over a hundred articles here in front of me.
[00:00:56.111 --> 00:01:00.675]  And it's cross-species, chimera, half-human, other creatures.
[00:01:01.374 --> 00:01:24.639]  They're saying, need to have rights, and then it's just back of the paper that this stuff's already been created, and wall-to-wall attacks on free speech in England, the US, calls for banning citizens filming police coast-to-coast, just absolute corruption everywhere, financial situation spiraling out of control.
[00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.300]  I mean, it's just off the charts!
[00:01:30.285 --> 00:01:31.066]  It's off the charts.
[00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:36.669]  It's like I'm a radio operator in a foxhole being overrun by 10 million enemy soldiers.
[00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.250]  I don't even know what to report.
[00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:54.021]  Just that we're under continual, sustained bombardment by the parasite ruling class that has just turned loose massive flotillas of bureaucrats to eat our substance, running around crazed-eyed, enjoying themselves.
[00:02:02.935 --> 00:02:03.915]  In fact, let me just do this.
[00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:07.677]  This is the best way to just describe what I'm facing here, what we're facing.
[00:02:08.678 --> 00:02:11.019]  Explosive packed car diffused in London.
[00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:13.620]  Terror threat as London bombing foiled.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.781]  British Mi-5 had hand in previous car bombings.
[00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:19.442]  Was London scare heralded on the web?
[00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:24.465]  London on terror alert after massive bomb attack on bar.
[00:02:25.065 --> 00:02:26.045]  What a deceptive headline.
[00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:27.006]  There was no bomb attack.
[00:02:27.026 --> 00:02:28.126]  There was no bomb went off.
[00:02:28.626 --> 00:02:29.627]  It's a smoke bomb.
[00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:32.008]  Thank God the British are just dealing with what they did.
[00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:42.126]  After 7-7, remember a few weeks after 7-7, on 7-21 they threw some smoke bombs around the street and said it was an Al-Qaeda attack.
[00:02:42.426 --> 00:02:45.388]  So at least they've stopped actually killing people for now.
[00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:51.093]  BIS warns of Great Depression dangers from credit spree.
[00:02:52.474 --> 00:02:55.015]  That's the most respected financial body in the world.
[00:02:55.616 --> 00:02:57.938]  Banks set to call in a swath of loans in U.S.
[00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:05.896]  For those that don't know out there, because you never read the 500 plus page contract you sign on your mortgage, they can call those in any time.
[00:03:07.497 --> 00:03:07.817]  Okay?
[00:03:10.018 --> 00:03:11.659]  I know, mortgages don't exist either.
[00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:18.342]  I understand there's no illegal aliens either, and there's a... New Hampshire governor signs law banning Real ID.
[00:03:18.382 --> 00:03:19.503]  I guess that's some good news.
[00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:24.285]  This is New York.
[00:03:24.305 --> 00:03:27.627]  Now, I've already had the literal goon police
[00:03:28.553 --> 00:03:34.154]  You've seen it in martial law, walk up, you can be anywhere in a park, anywhere interviewing somebody, and they just say, turn your camera off, you're not allowed to.
[00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:37.915]  Let me see your press passes, and scream at you, and you go, well, that's the First Amendment.
[00:03:38.496 --> 00:03:49.458]  And they huff and puff, and a lot of times do arrest reporters, even AP reporters, even American Spectator reporters, we've had them all on, Village Voice reporters, you can have it, they don't care.
[00:03:49.478 --> 00:03:52.519]  It's all part of living in a third world cesspit.
[00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:54.099]  A pathetic tyranny.
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.020]  Land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[00:03:57.088 --> 00:04:03.532]  I just don't want to hear what we're free anymore, or hear you shoot your mouth off, or stew your vehicles with plastic desecrated American flags.
[00:04:04.232 --> 00:04:06.433]  We're not going to get this country back until we admit it.
[00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:08.375]  Well, here it is.
[00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:13.558]  You read the New York Times article, City May Seek Permit and Insurance for Many Kinds of Public Photography.
[00:04:14.358 --> 00:04:26.065]  You actually read the city proposal, and what it does is just bans any cameras, anytime, anywhere, unless you go get a million dollars in insurance.
[00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.841]  And basically, they've put over a million cameras up in the city to watch the people.
[00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:41.927]  And we've already got police and security guards walking up going, I'm gonna say you got a bum if you don't turn the camera off, alright?
[00:04:44.028 --> 00:04:46.050]  The city's mafia run, pal.
[00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.093]  And, uh, you're gonna turn the camera off, so we can have our wazes with ya's.
[00:04:52.613 --> 00:04:55.215]  Our journey towards enslavement is just beginning.
[00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:56.780]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.523]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.805 --> 00:05:03.846]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:06.969]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.373]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:05:11.814 --> 00:05:12.654]  So what do you do?
[00:05:12.955 --> 00:05:17.519]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:20.141]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:21.502]  Sheltering in Place.
[00:05:21.922 --> 00:05:25.645]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:35.312]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:05:35.372 --> 00:05:35.752]  government.
[00:05:35.992 --> 00:05:42.417]  Gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:05:42.777 --> 00:05:47.161]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:09.366]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:09.746 --> 00:06:17.378]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:25.121]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:36.966]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.266 --> 00:06:40.788]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.228 --> 00:06:43.189]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.489 --> 00:06:47.331]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:02.614 --> 00:07:06.756]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:07:06.976 --> 00:07:08.737]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:07:08.997 --> 00:07:15.280]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:21.703]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:07:21.943 --> 00:07:27.966]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[00:07:28.266 --> 00:07:34.670]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.352]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[00:07:38.652 --> 00:07:42.375]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[00:07:42.555 --> 00:07:45.096]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:07:45.216 --> 00:07:46.277]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:46.557 --> 00:07:47.997]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.086 --> 00:08:30.947]  In Soviet Russia, you couldn't protest or demonstrate.
[00:08:31.107 --> 00:08:33.448]  Putin has brought that back now in the last five years.
[00:08:34.388 --> 00:08:41.791]  Any group trying to demonstrate, unless it's a pro-government group, liberal, conservative, police unions, doesn't matter,
[00:08:42.792 --> 00:08:46.495]  The federal police come out and literally crack their heads open.
[00:08:47.196 --> 00:08:51.059]  Point-blank range, swinging huge batons, crack heads open.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.742]  And it's on the news every few months.
[00:08:54.702 --> 00:08:56.584]  Wherein people will still try to demonstrate.
[00:08:58.606 --> 00:09:00.808]  Now, they call it free speech zones.
[00:09:00.848 --> 00:09:03.130]  They just say you're not allowed to protest in this zone.
[00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.972]  Nowhere in Red Square, anywhere.
[00:09:06.954 --> 00:09:16.059]  In communist China, if they see you with a video camera, and it looks like you're just a mindless tourist, they leave you alone, but it looks like you're any type of journalist or videotape of the police.
[00:09:16.739 --> 00:09:21.002]  They walk over, and China doesn't say, we don't have free speech, we're a police state.
[00:09:21.042 --> 00:09:23.003]  They say, you do not have your permit!
[00:09:23.083 --> 00:09:24.003]  And then they arrest you.
[00:09:25.004 --> 00:09:26.845]  And then beat the daylights out of you on the way to jail.
[00:09:28.965 --> 00:09:30.966]  You know, tyranny doesn't come out and say it's tyranny.
[00:09:30.986 --> 00:09:33.867]  They always have little excuses and rules.
[00:09:33.947 --> 00:09:44.090]  And all over this nation, you can have 500 demonstrators, in some of the more famous cases in North Carolina or Tennessee or New York, who are for Bush.
[00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:49.111]  And then one person saying no blood for oil, Secret Service orders them arrested, they get two years in prison.
[00:09:49.551 --> 00:09:50.832]  Just, you're not allowed to demonstrate.
[00:09:51.912 --> 00:09:57.254]  Now, many cities and counties have tried in the last six years to do this, but they've had to back off
[00:09:58.667 --> 00:10:01.530]  Because they've been sued and they've lost.
[00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.734]  New York City, Chicago, LA, other areas don't care.
[00:10:07.195 --> 00:10:09.217]  They will pay out unlimited lawsuits.
[00:10:10.218 --> 00:10:14.362]  They don't care how many times you win, how many times you prove it unconstitutional.
[00:10:14.902 --> 00:10:16.043]  They will enforce it.
[00:10:18.105 --> 00:10:22.089]  And in the name of fighting terrorism, first it's you can't videotape on the subways.
[00:10:23.067 --> 00:10:40.032]  And then, oh, you can't videotape in the streets, and oh, we're going to arrest hundreds of people every year, claiming that they're with Al-Qaeda, if you videotape your family at Central Park, or you walk around with a video camera, and they've told the cops.
[00:10:41.212 --> 00:10:47.854]  In fact, police have even, a few years ago, bought full-page ads saying, we're sorry, we've been ordered to be mean to you in New York.
[00:10:48.294 --> 00:10:49.394]  The police union did that.
[00:10:50.433 --> 00:10:54.696]  About half the cops are real nice, the other half are thugs and like to abuse people, and they love it.
[00:10:55.296 --> 00:11:03.381]  But the police union bought a full-page ad and said, please, we're not part of this because pregnant women sit down on a bench too long, we arrest them.
[00:11:03.401 --> 00:11:06.503]  I mean, it's just total enforcement.
[00:11:07.103 --> 00:11:09.965]  It's the government letting us know that we're the slaves.
[00:11:10.945 --> 00:11:14.868]  And you'll notice cops now look at you all crazed-eyed, they act all paranoid, they're running around.
[00:11:15.248 --> 00:11:16.989]  They've been told to do that coast-to-coast.
[00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:19.291]  And we've got it on tape.
[00:11:20.732 --> 00:11:31.718]  Posted countless videos in New York City alone of reporters or just citizens out and you'll be at a demonstration or wherever and the cops come over and say turn your cameras off.
[00:11:32.658 --> 00:11:33.218]  You'll say why?
[00:11:33.358 --> 00:11:34.199]  Because I said so.
[00:11:34.939 --> 00:11:36.260]  Or we're going to say you got a bomb.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.462]  Now we know you don't have a bomb but we're going to say you got a bomb.
[00:11:40.522 --> 00:11:44.384]  Larry Silverstein doesn't like you down here saying 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:11:44.444 --> 00:11:45.825]  Well it doesn't matter what Larry likes.
[00:11:47.049 --> 00:11:50.371]  The plainclothes guys call over the uniformed cops and they put people in handcuffs.
[00:11:51.472 --> 00:11:52.252]  Then let them go later.
[00:11:54.233 --> 00:12:01.017]  Now, New York City, and I've actually read the proposal, and of course, whatever proposal, they just act like they're having a public announcement.
[00:12:01.818 --> 00:12:04.599]  They had the public meeting last night that was never announced.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:14.245]  Quote, no one showed up, so they say they're going to go ahead now and announce in three days, when next month starts, next Monday,
[00:12:15.376 --> 00:12:19.840]  In July, they're going to announce that all videotaping is banned in the city.
[00:12:21.901 --> 00:12:35.232]  Now understand, they're putting up cameras everywhere, scanning your face and reading your lips, and that's been $2 billion in Homeland Security money to put in federal cameras, and cops, goons everywhere with binoculars and cameras running around feeding on you.
[00:12:37.646 --> 00:12:41.390]  Shoving you around, commanding you, letting you know that you're a slave.
[00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:43.212]  Letting you know the new score.
[00:12:43.692 --> 00:12:45.154]  This isn't America anymore.
[00:12:46.836 --> 00:12:51.100]  Now, of course, the illegal aliens are above the law and are allowed to drunk drive, allowed to not have a driver's license.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:13:00.690]  If a Florida sheriff does the right thing and just drives up to construction sites and sees who runs, that's clearly probable cause, the Civil Liberties Union is going to sue them.
[00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:06.852]  Civil Liberties Union is saying they're looking at this case to make sure it's implemented right.
[00:13:06.892 --> 00:13:15.635]  See, that's how they create bad... See, when it's a real free speech liberty, they will go in and agree with it and go along with the loss of the freedom.
[00:13:17.416 --> 00:13:30.821]  But then when it's a right that doesn't exist, like male transvestites going into women's restrooms and freaking them out, they'll go along with that.
[00:13:32.436 --> 00:13:34.277]  Some stupid thing that doesn't even matter.
[00:13:37.379 --> 00:13:41.802]  Or they'll claim you've got a right to march naked in your parade down Main Street.
[00:13:42.482 --> 00:13:43.663]  Rights that don't exist.
[00:13:44.604 --> 00:13:54.430]  But then when it comes down to basic citizen journalist with video cameras on the street, they're charging people coast-to-coast with eavesdropping
[00:13:55.174 --> 00:13:57.015]  They're charging them with wiretapping.
[00:13:57.436 --> 00:13:58.997]  They're charging people with felonies.
[00:13:59.377 --> 00:14:04.121]  I mean, you put a camera up to show speeding cops in your street, and you call the police department, they come and arrest you.
[00:14:06.343 --> 00:14:07.303]  And they say, guess what?
[00:14:07.323 --> 00:14:08.404]  You're not allowed to tape us.
[00:14:08.424 --> 00:14:09.185]  You're going to jail.
[00:14:11.266 --> 00:14:15.890]  Now, nine times out of ten, we get them to drop the charges, or they get in trouble, but they don't care, folks.
[00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.431]  You can beat the left, you can't beat the right.
[00:14:19.443 --> 00:14:22.824]  And when the most basic freedom of videotaping the police is under attack.
[00:14:22.844 --> 00:14:26.105]  I mean, I have a whole stack of news here on Free Speech today.
[00:14:26.905 --> 00:14:29.086]  But let me just cover this first.
[00:14:31.926 --> 00:14:36.828]  City may seek permit and insurance for many kinds of public photography.
[00:14:36.868 --> 00:14:39.588]  See, it gives it a nice little whoa!
[00:14:40.109 --> 00:14:42.289]  It's got some procedure to it.
[00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:45.050]  The tyrant's favorite mode.
[00:14:47.409 --> 00:14:48.470]  They don't call it like it is.
[00:14:48.530 --> 00:15:02.978]  It says some tourist, amateur photographers, and even would-be filmmakers, hoping to make it big on YouTube, could soon be forced to obtain a city permit and one million dollars in liability insurance before taking pictures or filming on city property, including sidewalks.
[00:15:03.819 --> 00:15:06.320]  Let me just tell the police and the government something right now.
[00:15:07.021 --> 00:15:08.502]  You have failed.
[00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:11.243]  You're not going to stop all the tiny phones.
[00:15:11.604 --> 00:15:13.245]  You're not going to stop the hidden cameras.
[00:15:13.566 --> 00:15:16.129]  You're not going to stop all the video iPods.
[00:15:16.409 --> 00:15:17.730]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:15:18.992 --> 00:15:25.519]  You can claim you have a right to beat up old ladies and beat people up and choke children and do all the rest your bull.
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.123]  And you think you can do it and not have it be put out on the web?
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.241]  This isn't going to work.
[00:15:31.301 --> 00:15:38.945]  And you can have your thug police walk around and treat us... By the way, they mean to have this in place for the 9-11 demonstrations.
[00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:40.586]  I'm going to be there on 9-11.
[00:15:40.666 --> 00:15:41.246]  I'm telling everybody.
[00:15:43.368 --> 00:15:45.689]  We don't need 2,000 people like we had last year.
[00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:50.332]  I am demanding you come to New York, 50,000 of you, and not be afraid.
[00:15:50.572 --> 00:15:57.575]  The disinfo agents in the so-called 9-11 Truth Movement put out disinfo, don't go to Chicago, don't go to L.A., don't go to New York for 9-11 Truth.
[00:15:57.635 --> 00:15:58.976]  It's all a bunch of fear-mongering.
[00:15:59.356 --> 00:16:04.919]  You need to be there, and they cannot arrest 10,000 people with video cameras.
[00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:05.980]  They can't arrest 2,000.
[00:16:07.708 --> 00:16:17.496]  And I am going to New York, and I'm going to have my video cameras, and if the cops come up to me and tell me I can't videotape, I'm going to go, go ahead and arrest me, buddy.
[00:16:17.957 --> 00:16:18.597]  And they will, too.
[00:16:18.617 --> 00:16:19.098]  They don't care.
[00:16:19.918 --> 00:16:21.760]  Because they know the city will pay out the suits.
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:27.245]  But I'm going to take it all the way to the Supreme Court, and I am going to sue those officers personally.
[00:16:27.765 --> 00:16:30.267]  You can set your watch and warrant by it.
[00:16:31.328 --> 00:16:34.871]  I am not going to go along with this baloney.
[00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:39.933]  And it's going to be brought into court how they got, how it's my First Amendment, how it's free speech.
[00:16:39.974 --> 00:16:41.795]  They're to document their activities.
[00:16:43.596 --> 00:16:44.736]  And you see, they're mad, folks.
[00:16:44.756 --> 00:16:53.642]  They're mad that we got security, city security people and police on tape trying to claim bombs are in people's bags because they have cameras and saying we're going to frame you.
[00:16:54.502 --> 00:17:02.707]  They're mad because their thuggish criminal behavior is being exposed and they're losing the fight for hearts and minds.
[00:17:03.047 --> 00:17:05.489]  And by the way, whatever happens in New York, they try to pass nationwide.
[00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:09.291]  And they're gonna be trying this nationwide.
[00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:12.373]  Oh, you gotta have a permit for that camera!
[00:17:12.733 --> 00:17:15.234]  It's a privilege to videotape!
[00:17:15.915 --> 00:17:17.255]  You go, no, no, no, it's not a privilege.
[00:17:17.796 --> 00:17:19.216]  They say everything's a privilege.
[00:17:20.297 --> 00:17:25.440]  What's a privilege is you suck it off us, you greedy, filth-covered parasites!
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.641]  You anti-American cancer!
[00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:33.997]  Some tourists, amateur photographers, and even would-be filmmakers are hoping to make it big.
[00:17:34.037 --> 00:17:39.100]  See, they imply, ooh, they bring in some type of social envy there.
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.161]  Ooh, make it big.
[00:17:40.361 --> 00:17:41.862]  How about our free speech, you punks?
[00:17:42.162 --> 00:17:44.783]  How about trying to make this country survive under total assault?
[00:17:45.404 --> 00:17:48.746]  Could be forced to obtain a city permit and one million in liability insurance.
[00:17:50.046 --> 00:17:56.330]  New rules being considered by the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater, Broadcasting would require any group or two or more people
[00:17:59.136 --> 00:18:04.457]  Folks, I've already had cops tell me no filming is allowed in the city and threaten to arrest me and start grabbing on me with no law.
[00:18:05.238 --> 00:18:07.058]  This is going to be a reign of hell.
[00:18:07.898 --> 00:18:12.379]  New rules being considered by the mayor's office who, by the way, is in a conflict of interest.
[00:18:12.419 --> 00:18:22.482]  He owns the biggest media outlet in New York, the fourth biggest media outlet in this country, Bloomberg, and this is to have a monopoly in the city
[00:18:23.709 --> 00:18:25.951]  With photography and video and everything he does.
[00:18:26.151 --> 00:18:27.572]  This is a conflict of interest.
[00:18:27.772 --> 00:18:29.153]  This is a trust behavior.
[00:18:29.414 --> 00:18:31.155]  By the way, the newspapers are behind this.
[00:18:31.455 --> 00:18:33.037]  Bloomberg needs to be sued for this.
[00:18:33.057 --> 00:18:39.762]  You need to call Bloomberg Branches, New York Bloomberg, and you need to call them and you need to tell them that they're going to be sued over this.
[00:18:39.822 --> 00:18:40.763]  We know why they're doing it.
[00:18:41.363 --> 00:18:42.484]  There's other reasons as well.
[00:18:43.985 --> 00:18:45.947]  It's the establishment circling the wagons.
[00:18:46.467 --> 00:18:47.728]  You go ahead and circle them.
[00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:49.450]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:18:51.241 --> 00:18:57.768]  New rules being considered by the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater, and Broadcasting would require any group... See, they claim you're all under that now.
[00:18:58.469 --> 00:19:03.395]  So they just say you're under your jurisdiction and then order mindless thugs to go out and carry it out.
[00:19:04.235 --> 00:19:09.677]  Who'll breathe deadly powders and die and still thanking their government masters.
[00:19:10.177 --> 00:19:16.540]  And call us conspiracy theorists when we day one said send breathing apparatchik to the police and firemen on Ground Zero.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.680]  What do we get from them?
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.922]  We get the thanks of them hanging over us with their big fat faces killing America!
[00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:24.583]  Just slashing America!
[00:19:24.743 --> 00:19:28.265]  Just plunging daggers into its heart with pleasure and hatred!
[00:19:28.285 --> 00:19:31.526]  You just enjoy all the stuff you breathe in.
[00:19:33.115 --> 00:19:44.400]  And it goes on, new rules being considered by the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater, and Broadcast would require any group of two or more people who want to use a camera in a single public location for more than half an hour to get a city permit.
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:53.743]  Folks, we've gone and gotten permits before to have demonstrations there, and the cops come up like savage piranha and just go, we're not gonna let you have it.
[00:19:53.904 --> 00:19:54.984]  This isn't a real permit.
[00:19:55.124 --> 00:19:57.525]  And they act just like Nazi scum!
[00:19:58.465 --> 00:19:59.426]  Oh, I hate you!
[00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.351]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:04.951 --> 00:20:13.893]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:21.535]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.265 --> 00:20:27.751]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.251 --> 00:20:39.082]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:41.845]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:20:45.226 --> 00:20:45.546]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:21:00.965 --> 00:21:01.405]  Gold.
[00:21:01.746 --> 00:21:03.027]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:03.287 --> 00:21:09.372]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:09.572 --> 00:21:13.375]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:13.735 --> 00:21:15.617]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:15.677 --> 00:21:17.959]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:18.119 --> 00:21:25.725]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:21:25.745 --> 00:21:26.606]  We're good to go.
[00:21:40.981 --> 00:21:46.605]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[00:21:46.905 --> 00:21:49.467]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:21:49.487 --> 00:21:55.851]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[00:21:55.991 --> 00:21:57.032]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.378 --> 00:22:06.882]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:22:07.222 --> 00:22:11.326]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:22:11.606 --> 00:22:12.167]  We listened.
[00:22:12.467 --> 00:22:17.471]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:22:17.732 --> 00:22:18.212]  We listened.
[00:22:18.592 --> 00:22:21.655]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:22:22.075 --> 00:22:22.596]  We listened.
[00:22:23.036 --> 00:22:27.119]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:27.980]  We listened.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.564]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:22:33.984 --> 00:22:35.325]  Again, we listened.
[00:22:35.705 --> 00:22:37.287]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:22:37.467 --> 00:22:43.031]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:22:43.491 --> 00:22:46.113]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[00:22:46.313 --> 00:22:46.513]  Only $279.
[00:22:46.553 --> 00:22:47.173]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:47.213 --> 00:22:47.493]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:49.114]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:22:49.134 --> 00:22:50.095]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:59.443 --> 00:23:02.166]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[00:23:02.547 --> 00:23:09.055]  Since January of 2006, RxDrugCard.com members have saved an average of $33 per prescription filled.

[00:23:41.773 --> 00:23:42.394]  Day after day
[00:24:11.326 --> 00:24:17.311]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:20.573]  But nobody wants to know him.
[00:24:20.994 --> 00:24:24.716]  They can see that he's just a fool.
[00:24:24.837 --> 00:24:33.103]  And he never gives an answer but the fool... The United States is the United States because of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:24:33.203 --> 00:24:40.909]  Did you see a bunch of mafia thugs in police uniforms with their bosses blowing up buildings and running around stealing and
[00:24:41.713 --> 00:24:49.095]  Pumping in all the foreigners and destroying the country, while they arrogantly run around telling us how lucky we are we've got them.
[00:24:50.195 --> 00:25:01.098]  And it goes on in the New York Times to say that anyone going in the Empire State's building, any street, if you have a camera around your neck, a camera bag, that is considered unauthorized filming.
[00:25:01.118 --> 00:25:01.618]  Let me just read it.
[00:25:06.279 --> 00:25:09.700]  It says in any public location for more than 10 minutes, including the time,
[00:25:11.602 --> 00:25:13.203]  It takes to set up any equipment.
[00:25:13.683 --> 00:25:22.045]  Julian Chow, Assistant Commissioner of the Film Office, said the rules were not intended to apply to families on vacation, or amateur filmmakers, or photographers.
[00:25:22.165 --> 00:25:23.466]  Pure bull.
[00:25:24.526 --> 00:25:26.807]  I've already had cops going, well, where's your permit?
[00:25:27.207 --> 00:25:27.447]  Hey!
[00:25:27.627 --> 00:25:28.767]  I'm talking to you!
[00:25:28.787 --> 00:25:31.488]  I mean, literally, I'm talking to you!
[00:25:31.748 --> 00:25:34.349]  I got this job so I can push people around!
[00:25:35.009 --> 00:25:35.990]  I hate America!
[00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.970]  Literally, I'm just like, I hate you too, you filth!
[00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:40.591]  Because you're not America.
[00:25:43.678 --> 00:25:44.819]  We ought to hate these people!
[00:25:44.859 --> 00:25:46.099]  They want to run our lives, folks.
[00:25:46.119 --> 00:25:47.060]  Let me tell you how tyranny works.
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.961]  Once you go over the edge, it's a slippery slope, and we've now reached it.
[00:25:52.102 --> 00:26:07.109]  Nevertheless, the New York Civil Liberties Union, again, they're going to drop the ball, listen carefully, says proposed rules are strictly interpreted, could have the effect, the group also warns, the rules set for stage for selective and perhaps discriminatory enforcement by police.
[00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:08.210]  Of course!
[00:26:09.597 --> 00:26:20.162]  These rules will apply to a huge range of casual photography and filming, including tourists taking snapshots and people making short videos for YouTube, said Christopher Dunn, the group's Associate Legal Director.
[00:26:21.323 --> 00:26:28.646]  Mr. Dunn suggested that the city deliberately kept the language vague, and that as a result, police could have broad discretion in enforcing the rules.
[00:26:28.686 --> 00:26:29.646]  And again, they're not police.
[00:26:29.686 --> 00:26:33.268]  They're corporate mafia criminal enforcers that wear uniforms.
[00:26:34.109 --> 00:26:34.709]  The Soviets.
[00:26:35.309 --> 00:26:35.789]  The Nazis.
[00:26:35.809 --> 00:26:36.430]  Whatever you want to call them.
[00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:37.070]  That's what they are now.
[00:26:37.705 --> 00:26:47.353]  In a letter sent to the film office this week, Mr. Dunn said the proposed rules would potentially apply to tourists in places like Times Square, Rockefeller Center, or Ground Zero.
[00:26:47.713 --> 00:26:51.856]  By the way, folks, we've been in New York, just sitting there with a video camera, and cops just walk over.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.562]  They see it as a threat to their criminality.
[00:26:58.582 --> 00:26:59.162]  They're criminals.
[00:26:59.522 --> 00:27:01.664]  Criminals don't want to be on tape.
[00:27:02.245 --> 00:27:02.585]  Period.
[00:27:04.611 --> 00:27:08.693]  Where people routinely congregate for more than half an hour or photograph or film.
[00:27:09.854 --> 00:27:14.356]  The rule could also apply to people waiting in line to enter the Empire State Building or other tourist attractions.
[00:27:14.636 --> 00:27:18.298]  The rules define a single site as any area within 100 feet where filming begins.
[00:27:18.859 --> 00:27:25.802]  Under the rules, the two or more people would not actually have to be filming, but simply holding an ordinary camera and talking to each other.
[00:27:26.903 --> 00:27:28.584]  It's a demonstration, folks, what it's meant for.
[00:27:28.604 --> 00:27:30.425]  It's meant so they can just swing
[00:27:31.235 --> 00:27:32.495]  Batons, crackheads.
[00:27:32.856 --> 00:27:34.516]  We're confiscating the camera.
[00:27:34.796 --> 00:27:36.057]  You didn't have the permit.
[00:27:36.717 --> 00:27:39.838]  Let's show them what the new rules we got.
[00:27:40.718 --> 00:27:41.258]  You think I'm joking?
[00:27:41.278 --> 00:27:42.059]  That's how they are.
[00:27:42.079 --> 00:27:42.779]  It's fun.
[00:27:42.979 --> 00:27:44.399]  We run everything now.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.261]  In fact, you think I'm joking?
[00:27:48.281 --> 00:27:48.961]  Go ahead and play them.
[00:27:49.545 --> 00:27:49.965]  Here you go.
[00:27:49.985 --> 00:27:54.747]  These are security guns for Silverstein Commanding Police.
[00:27:55.247 --> 00:27:58.668]  Going, I know you don't got a bomb, but I'm gonna say you got a bomb.
[00:28:00.129 --> 00:28:01.329]  Guess who's going to jail?
[00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:02.689]  Guess who's going to jail?
[00:28:02.849 --> 00:28:04.330]  Here it is.
[00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:08.771]  When Ricky comes, I think he's got a bomb in his bag.
[00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:11.632]  I saw Wyatt coming out of there.
[00:28:11.652 --> 00:28:12.753]  I think he's got a bomb in his bag.
[00:28:14.202 --> 00:28:15.103]  We're not terrorists.
[00:28:15.123 --> 00:28:15.823]  We're Americans.
[00:28:15.903 --> 00:28:19.225]  By the time the government figures it out, you'll be in a hole for 30 days.
[00:28:26.118 --> 00:28:26.898]  Disunderstand.
[00:28:27.099 --> 00:28:28.419]  Just don't record what he's saying.
[00:28:28.659 --> 00:28:31.100]  Don't record what I'm saying.
[00:28:31.461 --> 00:28:32.901]  Hey, police, do you have paper?
[00:28:33.001 --> 00:28:33.762]  I don't know.
[00:28:33.802 --> 00:28:36.923]  Okay, we don't have a problem with you guys.
[00:28:36.983 --> 00:28:37.363]  Come on.
[00:28:37.903 --> 00:28:38.964]  We do have a job.
[00:28:39.604 --> 00:28:40.505]  I do have a job, sir.
[00:28:41.325 --> 00:28:42.025]  Don't record this.
[00:28:42.085 --> 00:28:43.066]  Don't record this.
[00:28:43.146 --> 00:28:43.686]  Don't record this.
[00:28:43.706 --> 00:28:44.567]  Don't record.
[00:28:44.587 --> 00:28:46.047]  Show the camera over right now.
[00:28:46.147 --> 00:28:47.328]  Show it right now.
[00:28:47.388 --> 00:28:48.228]  Power go to you guys?
[00:28:48.348 --> 00:28:49.749]  Is that camera on, sir?
[00:28:49.809 --> 00:28:50.949]  Check that camera off.
[00:28:50.989 --> 00:28:51.370]  Is it on?
[00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.530]  Not at all.
[00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.332]  I mean, this is a public sidewalk, a public street.
[00:28:54.412 --> 00:29:02.418]  Now, I mean actual people out of The Sopranos, in actual trench coats, going, hey, we know you're not a terrorist, but you're going in a hole, it doesn't matter.
[00:29:02.458 --> 00:29:04.680]  By the time we figure it out... Did you hear him?
[00:29:21.474 --> 00:29:22.915]  Did you hear him over here?
[00:29:23.555 --> 00:29:25.597]  Let me tell you something, little man.
[00:29:25.997 --> 00:29:27.478]  We run the country now.
[00:29:28.298 --> 00:29:30.300]  You understand that?
[00:29:32.101 --> 00:29:33.802]  It's getting a lot funner, too.
[00:29:34.042 --> 00:29:39.085]  You ever wonder what it looked like when little grocery store owners get shut down by these people?
[00:29:40.466 --> 00:29:41.827]  Right out of The Sopranos.
[00:29:41.947 --> 00:29:45.610]  Right out of... Right out of... The Departed.
[00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:48.752]  You're all gonna get to live like this, America.
[00:29:49.112 --> 00:29:50.713]  With thugs ruling over you.
[00:29:51.647 --> 00:29:54.654]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.576 --> 00:29:58.262]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.946 --> 00:30:05.027]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.

[00:30:21.395 --> 00:30:24.777]  You also get another 335-page book and other material.

[00:30:49.685 --> 00:30:53.569]  The price of the whole package is $10, which includes media mail shipping.

[00:30:57.493 --> 00:30:59.615]  Mostholyfamilymonastery.com
[00:31:01.741 --> 00:31:02.361]  Morning, neighbor!
[00:31:02.741 --> 00:31:03.061]  Hey!
[00:31:03.501 --> 00:31:04.422]  Shouldn't you be at work?
[00:31:04.842 --> 00:31:05.162]  I am.
[00:31:05.422 --> 00:31:07.402]  As a matter of fact, I pulled another all-nighter.
[00:31:07.622 --> 00:31:08.303]  What do you mean?
[00:31:08.323 --> 00:31:11.363]  Well, I'm working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:31:11.623 --> 00:31:13.744]  Well, at least I'm making money 24-7.
[00:31:13.884 --> 00:31:15.044]  But I never have to go to work.
[00:31:15.344 --> 00:31:16.284]  So, what do you do?
[00:31:16.564 --> 00:31:17.665]  Not very much at all now.
[00:31:17.965 --> 00:31:19.725]  About a month ago, I heard about this website.
[00:31:19.745 --> 00:31:20.665]  It's got a funny name.
[00:31:20.725 --> 00:31:23.446]  It's DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:31:23.786 --> 00:31:24.767]  That is funny.
[00:31:25.007 --> 00:31:29.652]  Yeah, you can earn $1,200 to $12,000 a week starting the very first week.
[00:31:30.212 --> 00:31:32.314]  Oh, is that how you bought that new mower?
[00:31:32.434 --> 00:31:35.177]  Yeah, and the motorcycle I've always wanted, too.
[00:31:35.357 --> 00:31:36.038]  You should log on.
[00:31:36.178 --> 00:31:38.060]  Find out how you can become financially free.
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.701]  So, what was that website?
[00:31:39.781 --> 00:31:46.788]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com Just wait, I'll go get a pen so I can write that down.
[00:31:47.108 --> 00:31:48.170]  You don't need to write it down.
[00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:49.091]  It's easy to remember.
[00:31:49.331 --> 00:31:52.696]  DidYouRobBillGates.com Yeah!
[00:31:53.056 --> 00:31:56.702]  DidYouRobBillGates.com That is easy!
[00:31:57.022 --> 00:31:59.686]  It's easy and the money is awesome!
[00:32:01.496 --> 00:32:04.238]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[00:32:04.678 --> 00:32:06.959]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:10.341]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:12.982]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[00:32:13.142 --> 00:32:14.523]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[00:32:14.783 --> 00:32:18.906]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[00:32:19.246 --> 00:32:22.368]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[00:32:22.648 --> 00:32:23.888]  With more than 500 vital functions.
[00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:33.394]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.
[00:32:33.734 --> 00:32:36.456]  And it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.
[00:32:36.796 --> 00:32:44.121]  LIV52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol and prescription medications.
[00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:49.964]  To order Live52 and for the best source of research herbal products visit research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482.
[00:32:49.984 --> 00:32:52.125]  That's research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:32:52.145 --> 00:32:53.266]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:33:10.706 --> 00:33:12.347]  Thug police, coast to coast.
[00:33:12.807 --> 00:33:17.068]  Arresting people for videotaping them in public.
[00:33:18.109 --> 00:33:19.709]  Whatever happened to this country?
[00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:22.450]  I got news for ya.
[00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.651]  Every time tyranny starts, it doesn't stop.
[00:33:25.051 --> 00:33:26.011]  Until it is stopped.
[00:33:26.572 --> 00:33:27.072]  By us.
[00:33:27.812 --> 00:33:29.953]  It's gonna get worse and worse.
[00:33:30.013 --> 00:33:34.614]  The stealing, the looting, the no-bid contracts, the government announcing it's above the law.
[00:33:35.195 --> 00:33:38.536]  The mindless population cramming more burgers down their faces.
[00:33:40.131 --> 00:33:44.914]  But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way the hours do.
[00:33:44.974 --> 00:33:50.136]  When you're riding 15 hours, there's nothing much to do.
[00:33:50.176 --> 00:33:57.921]  When you don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through.
[00:34:08.729 --> 00:34:13.670]  He's supposed to get angry about absolute head-on assaults on the First Amendment.
[00:34:15.991 --> 00:34:17.351]  They're not playing games.
[00:34:18.392 --> 00:34:35.736]  He goes on to say that... While the permitting scheme does not distinguish between commercial and other types of filming, we anticipate that the rules will have minimum of any impact on tourists and recreational photographers, including those who use tripods.
[00:34:36.658 --> 00:34:38.578]  Now again, that's all up to their discretion.
[00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:44.260]  The cops want to harass a family with a camera around their neck, which they do.
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.281]  I mean, you ought to go to New York and experience being treated like a slave, folks.
[00:34:49.901 --> 00:34:52.722]  Cops just literally walk by everybody like parts, and they all just strut.
[00:34:52.762 --> 00:34:56.022]  I mean, it's third world.
[00:34:56.642 --> 00:34:58.043]  Frankly, I've been in third world countries.
[00:34:58.103 --> 00:35:00.923]  Nicaragua, in places.
[00:35:03.204 --> 00:35:03.764]  Honduras.
[00:35:04.739 --> 00:35:06.299]  And the cops don't act like this.
[00:35:06.319 --> 00:35:14.042]  I mean, right out of some sci-fi nightmare movie, just thugs, and everybody kind of looks down when they walk by, and it's like, Yeah!
[00:35:14.242 --> 00:35:15.722]  You know who runs it!
[00:35:16.102 --> 00:35:17.923]  You know who is the man!
[00:35:18.203 --> 00:35:19.463]  We run things now!
[00:35:19.683 --> 00:35:20.643]  He-he-he!
[00:35:21.143 --> 00:35:22.344]  He-he-he!
[00:35:22.484 --> 00:35:24.724]  You think I'm... That's actually what they sound like!
[00:35:25.505 --> 00:35:26.125]  We have tapes!
[00:35:26.145 --> 00:35:27.125]  We can play more for ya!
[00:35:30.406 --> 00:35:31.726]  It's off country now!
[00:35:32.327 --> 00:35:33.267]  We run things!
[00:35:34.671 --> 00:35:37.113]  And let me tell you, once it gets to this point, it's over!
[00:35:37.593 --> 00:35:38.094]  You understand?
[00:35:38.534 --> 00:35:39.075]  You understand?
[00:35:39.815 --> 00:35:41.837]  Everybody thinks they're members of the establishment.
[00:35:42.137 --> 00:35:43.498]  The veneer is very thin.
[00:35:44.039 --> 00:35:46.761]  Once government goes bad, they just go wild.
[00:35:48.903 --> 00:35:49.843]  And it's now happening.
[00:35:50.564 --> 00:35:51.024]  It goes on.
[00:35:51.064 --> 00:35:52.005]  Banning filming in New York.
[00:35:52.025 --> 00:35:52.786]  Mr. Dunn said,
[00:35:53.945 --> 00:35:57.246]  But they've asked repeatedly for a distinction in negotiations on the rules.
[00:35:57.266 --> 00:35:59.387]  See, they're actually going along with it, so they're just filing suit.
[00:35:59.707 --> 00:36:05.690]  But the city officials refused, essentially, to avoid creating loopholes that could be exploited by professional filmmakers and photographers.
[00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:19.235]  City officials want to confirm that yesterday, but Mark W. Waschenheim, a lawyer for the city's law department, which helped draft the rules, said there are few instances, if any, where the casual tourist will be affected.
[00:36:19.335 --> 00:36:20.195]  Pure bull.
[00:36:20.375 --> 00:36:22.036]  Because they know there's a First Amendment issue there.
[00:36:23.638 --> 00:36:24.959]  There's a First Amendment issue everywhere.
[00:36:24.979 --> 00:36:25.860]  These are our streets.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.801]  This is our country.
[00:36:30.184 --> 00:36:34.507]  The film office has a public hearing on proposed rules yesterday, but no one attended because it wasn't announced.
[00:36:34.948 --> 00:36:38.111]  The only written comments in the department received were from civil liberties groups and Ms.
[00:36:38.151 --> 00:36:38.431]  Chow.
[00:36:39.151 --> 00:36:42.674]  Chow said the office expected to publish a final version of the rules at the end of July.
[00:36:43.775 --> 00:36:45.497]  They would go into effect a month later.
[00:36:46.454 --> 00:36:54.978]  The permits would be free and applications could be obtained online, but you have to get a million dollars of insurance, by the way, that'll cost about a thousand a month.
[00:36:55.599 --> 00:37:00.041]  The draft rules say the office could take up to 30 days to issue a permit.
[00:37:00.061 --> 00:37:00.241]  Ms.
[00:37:00.261 --> 00:37:03.643]  Chow said she expected that most would be issued within 24 hours.
[00:37:04.363 --> 00:37:07.685]  We got a sound permit last year to be able to bullhorn for one hour.
[00:37:09.125 --> 00:37:14.228]  The cops have the official permit signed by the local section chief.
[00:37:15.623 --> 00:37:23.569]  Didn't matter, they had to call him, make him come down, 30 minutes elapsed, then they cut a short 10 minutes, so we got 20 minutes.
[00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:30.055]  With the whole time with him going, ehhh, hold on, stop for a minute, I gotta check something again.
[00:37:31.196 --> 00:37:36.380]  Alright, you gotta stay in this little cage, and when I say you can talk, you can talk.
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:37.821]  That sound good to you?
[00:37:38.682 --> 00:37:40.243]  Sound real nice to you?
[00:37:44.321 --> 00:37:45.222]  That's how this is.
[00:37:45.783 --> 00:37:47.365]  Let me see that permit.
[00:37:47.545 --> 00:37:48.666]  Keep your mouth shut!
[00:37:48.906 --> 00:37:49.907]  Shut your mouth!
[00:37:50.508 --> 00:37:52.190]  And they go, no, tell me your name.
[00:37:52.691 --> 00:37:53.531]  My name's Alex Jones.
[00:37:53.692 --> 00:37:54.973]  I said shut up!
[00:37:56.054 --> 00:38:01.380]  A lot of you never signed up to be in the Marine Corps and go through boot camp, but you're going to get to have it in America now.
[00:38:02.121 --> 00:38:03.643]  Did I ask you to talk?
[00:38:04.815 --> 00:38:06.476]  And then you say, well, yeah, you just... AH!
[00:38:06.516 --> 00:38:06.836]  SHIT!
[00:38:06.876 --> 00:38:07.156]  SHIT!
[00:38:07.196 --> 00:38:07.516]  SHIT!
[00:38:07.816 --> 00:38:08.636]  I'M ARRESTED!
[00:38:09.717 --> 00:38:10.157]  OH GOD!
[00:38:10.197 --> 00:38:11.737]  I'M A WEAK, GALLANTLY PERSON!
[00:38:11.997 --> 00:38:13.378]  AND I JUST DO THIS ALL DAY!
[00:38:13.398 --> 00:38:15.419]  STROKING MY PETTY EGO!
[00:38:15.699 --> 00:38:15.859]  OH!
[00:38:16.379 --> 00:38:16.539]  OH!
[00:38:16.939 --> 00:38:18.120]  I HATE AMERICA!
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:18.600]  OH!
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.060]  IT FEELS SO GOOD!
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.961]  FEELS SO GOOD TO DO THIS TO THE COUNTRY!
[00:38:25.622 --> 00:38:27.043]  The country is run by mafia.
[00:38:27.063 --> 00:38:27.923]  Do you understand that now?
[00:38:33.266 --> 00:38:38.154]  Mr. Dunn says in addition to the rules being overreaching, they would also create enforcement problems.
[00:38:38.434 --> 00:38:41.640]  Your everyday person out there with a camcorder is never going to know about the rules.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.563]  Oh, but they're going to find out!
[00:38:44.338 --> 00:38:47.460]  They're going to find out from the family soon enough.
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.701]  Mr. Dunn said it completely opens the door for discriminatory enforcement.
[00:38:51.041 --> 00:38:52.082]  That's the name of the game.
[00:38:52.582 --> 00:39:00.406]  Of the permit requirements, and that is an enormous concern to us because the people who are going to get pointed out are people who have dark skin.
[00:39:00.786 --> 00:39:05.409]  Oh no, don't worry, they always say that knowing the public's racist and then we'll be for the bill.
[00:39:05.429 --> 00:39:07.890]  We're not even for the bill, the policy.
[00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:10.131]  Or who are shooting in certain locations.
[00:39:10.471 --> 00:39:13.893]  The rules were promulgated as a result of such a case, Mr. Dunn said.
[00:39:15.299 --> 00:39:24.804]  In May 2005, Rakesh Sharmara, an Indian documentary filmmaker, was using a handheld video camera in Midtown Manhattan when he was detained for several hours and questioned by police.
[00:39:25.804 --> 00:39:26.665]  What about all our people?
[00:39:26.685 --> 00:39:27.165]  What about me?
[00:39:27.205 --> 00:39:28.145]  What about Luke Radowsky?
[00:39:29.406 --> 00:39:33.668]  During his detention, Mr. Sharmara was told he was required to have a permit to film on city property.
[00:39:34.328 --> 00:39:36.029]  And they claim the streets are the city property.
[00:39:36.249 --> 00:39:40.731]  The city owns it, and you don't have no right to even... It's a privilege to walk down the street.
[00:39:40.751 --> 00:39:42.112]  In fact, cops tell me that.
[00:39:42.332 --> 00:39:43.873]  Yes, everything's a privilege now.
[00:39:44.759 --> 00:39:46.100]  And, uh, I'm your king now.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:46.761]  How does that sound?
[00:39:47.561 --> 00:39:52.465]  During his detention, Mr. Samara was told he was required to have a permit to film on city property.
[00:39:52.485 --> 00:40:00.652]  According to the lawsuit, Mr. Samara sought information about how permits were granted and who was required to have them, but found there was no written guidelines.
[00:40:01.032 --> 00:40:02.794]  That's the way we like it here in the family.
[00:40:03.835 --> 00:40:09.880]  Nonetheless, the film office told him he was required to have a permit, but when he applied, the office refused to grant him one.
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.522]  It would not give him a written expansion.
[00:40:14.128 --> 00:40:21.050]  As part of the statement reached in April, the film office agreed to establish written rules, was issuing permits, and it goes on.
[00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:23.070]  Okay.
[00:40:25.691 --> 00:40:35.453]  Now, I'm going to give you the number to Bloomberg News, because the criminal mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, is a criminal.
[00:40:36.013 --> 00:40:41.694]  He's engaged in all sorts of unconstitutional activities, not the ultimate crimes in this country, even though you've been taught just to accept it.
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:47.621]  This is also a move by the newspapers and his private company to block any competition in New York.
[00:40:49.182 --> 00:40:53.163]  Because then they can pay all the little fees and things and then things are selectively enforced.
[00:40:53.683 --> 00:40:55.323]  But then the average small group can't.
[00:40:55.543 --> 00:40:59.804]  So it's, again, big corporations always lobby for regulations to shut down small businesses.
[00:41:00.985 --> 00:41:10.727]  So you just call Bloomberg up and you let them know that we understand that this is part of the newspapers and photo guilds getting together to try to shut down free speech.
[00:41:12.213 --> 00:41:14.155]  That's the only way to really get at Bloomberg.
[00:41:15.136 --> 00:41:17.059]  So you call Bloomberg at 212-318-2000.
[00:41:17.079 --> 00:41:19.742]  I want you all to call.
[00:41:20.402 --> 00:41:24.107]  Please.
[00:41:24.127 --> 00:41:24.767]  212-318-2000.
[00:41:24.807 --> 00:41:27.290]  Now, you notice we just beat the immigration bill.
[00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:27.871]  At least for now.
[00:41:28.151 --> 00:41:30.534]  Kennedy swore last night that he, quote, will be back.
[00:41:31.525 --> 00:41:37.049]  They will be back in just a few months, but it's in more and more trouble, and this was a big victory.
[00:41:37.209 --> 00:41:39.991]  This wasn't just them playing possum, or playing dead on this.
[00:41:40.011 --> 00:41:41.432]  I'm going to get into that later.
[00:41:41.492 --> 00:41:58.903]  Big victory, but this attack on First Amendment, because the cops are now not even arresting spontaneous demonstrations in most cases, because New York's lost so many suits, and so many cops have been privately sued, because they were involved in official oppression, and many other crimes.
[00:41:59.816 --> 00:42:01.737]  So, they're now starting to back off there too.
[00:42:01.758 --> 00:42:03.018]  This is desperation mood.
[00:42:03.038 --> 00:42:05.640]  You need to call Bloomberg at 212-318-2000.
[00:42:06.241 --> 00:42:10.624]  That's down, again, Bloomberg's one of the biggest media owners in the world.
[00:42:12.245 --> 00:42:22.172]  He posed on the cover of Time Magazine last week with Arnold Schwarzenegger wearing a either vintage or perfect copy of a SS Colonel's belt buckle.
[00:42:22.993 --> 00:42:23.493]  I looked it up.
[00:42:23.553 --> 00:42:24.934]  It's an SS Colonel belt buckle.
[00:42:25.635 --> 00:42:31.177]  That's right, Schwarzenegger openly wears Nazi belt buckles with Michael Bloomberg, and it's no big deal.
[00:42:31.317 --> 00:42:33.398]  See, that's how dumb they think we are.
[00:42:33.658 --> 00:42:37.640]  This is the part of the flaunting that criminals engage in.
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:38.520]  212-318-2000.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:44.222]  Now, here's the New York City Mayor's Office of Film, Theater, and Broadcasting.
[00:42:45.163 --> 00:42:49.964]  At 1697 Broadway, 6th Floor Entrance, 53rd Street.
[00:42:50.004 --> 00:42:54.046]  We need to send Luke Rudowsky and the team out there, but they were the Democratic
[00:42:57.494 --> 00:42:58.715]  So-called debates last night.
[00:42:58.735 --> 00:42:59.736]  We haven't been able to get a hold of them.
[00:42:59.756 --> 00:43:00.436]  We hope they're okay.
[00:43:00.456 --> 00:43:02.578]  We've been calling them since last night and this morning, no answer.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:08.203]  Call the New York Mayor's Office of Film and let them know they're going to get sued personally.
[00:43:08.503 --> 00:43:10.484]  Let them know that we know this isn't even their jurisdiction.
[00:43:10.504 --> 00:43:13.967]  It's a color of law edict to then turn their goon police loose.
[00:43:14.328 --> 00:43:17.110]  Ask them if they've seen YouTube of people getting arrested already for filming.
[00:43:17.944 --> 00:43:23.049]  And tell them that we're fully aware of what they're doing.
[00:43:23.069 --> 00:43:23.109]  212-489-6710.
[00:43:23.129 --> 00:43:26.232]  212-489-6710.
[00:43:27.693 --> 00:43:29.515]  Call the New York City Mayor's Office.
[00:43:29.555 --> 00:43:31.877]  Don't threaten them, don't scream at them.
[00:43:32.197 --> 00:43:34.679]  Call them and be focused, but very cold.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.642]  And just say, how dare you try to destroy the First Amendment.
[00:43:40.234 --> 00:43:54.299]  2-1-2-4-8-9-6-7-1-0 and let them know you're going to sue the mayor personally for his conflict of interest because a lot of this is being lobbied for by not just Bloomberg but by Reuters and Getty Images and others to go after their competition.
[00:43:54.319 --> 00:43:54.559]  2-1-2-4-8-9-6-7-1-0.
[00:43:54.599 --> 00:43:58.860]  This is a key fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:00.521]  They're going to duplicate this coast to coast.
[00:44:00.541 --> 00:44:01.581]  You watch if they get it through.
[00:44:02.821 --> 00:44:04.162]  New York City's mayor office
[00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:06.810]  212 New York.
[00:44:07.291 --> 00:44:09.352]  And get through to the call screeners.
[00:44:09.673 --> 00:44:12.555]  Say, yes, I'd like the Secretary of the Mayor, please.
[00:44:12.635 --> 00:44:14.077]  Or I'd like the Mayor's Assistant, please.
[00:44:14.117 --> 00:44:16.779]  Or I'd like the Mayor's Publicist, please.
[00:44:16.959 --> 00:44:17.640]  Keep calling back.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.340]  Call different people.
[00:44:18.981 --> 00:44:23.345]  And just tell them you need to back off this whole thing of savaging free speech.
[00:44:23.405 --> 00:44:25.647]  You're goon police have beat up enough innocent people.
[00:44:26.661 --> 00:44:28.483]  Threatened to plant things on people.
[00:44:28.603 --> 00:44:31.086]  I mean, they think it's normal to do that.
[00:44:31.106 --> 00:44:32.568]  212 New York.
[00:44:32.588 --> 00:44:35.291]  212 New York is the letter acronym there.
[00:44:35.591 --> 00:44:35.691]  Or 212-639-9675. 212...
[00:44:40.828 --> 00:44:41.308]  639-9675.
[00:44:41.369 --> 00:44:52.519]  He is the mayor's office where he uses his office as a private conduit to suck money out of people and run his media empire out of New York.
[00:44:52.539 --> 00:44:53.360]  212-639-9675.
[00:44:54.140 --> 00:45:00.967]  And let him know that this is a guy who's now planning to run for president who doesn't agree with the First Amendment.
[00:45:01.715 --> 00:45:01.975]  212-639-9675.
[00:45:02.255 --> 00:45:14.578]  You know, in the city where George Washington fought the British 6-1, you got this pig, Bloomberg, up there saying he thinks he can annihilate America.
[00:45:14.598 --> 00:45:15.518]  212-639-9675.
[00:45:17.038 --> 00:45:19.339]  Call the Mayor's office right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:20.079 --> 00:45:22.459]  Call everybody and call the Mayor's office of film.
[00:45:22.479 --> 00:45:23.419]  212-489-6710.
[00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:29.321]  Or Bloomberg's actual private company that feeds off the city.
[00:45:29.341 --> 00:45:29.381]  212-318-2000.
[00:45:32.876 --> 00:45:35.777]  And tell him, leave the First Amendment alone, we're tired of his pig behavior.
[00:45:37.738 --> 00:45:42.259]  Who thinks that America's here for him to wallow on and feed on and defecate all over.
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:51.962]  Now, I typed Fairness Doctrine in two days ago into the search engine and hundreds of articles popped up.
[00:45:53.602 --> 00:45:58.924]  I found the actual FCC filing where a majority of the board
[00:45:59.844 --> 00:46:09.729]  Announced a week ago that they are considering, again by fiat, trying to restrict free speech on any and all talk radio and even claiming new jurisdiction over the internet, which they haven't previously had.
[00:46:09.849 --> 00:46:11.490]  Massive power grabs happening right now.
[00:46:12.411 --> 00:46:18.514]  Simultaneously, fake disinfo liberal news sites are saying it's a conspiracy theory and it doesn't exist.
[00:46:18.934 --> 00:46:28.759]  They said this yesterday when the House of Representatives moved to pass a binding law against the FCC, Federal Communications Commission, barring them from trying to restrict free speech.
[00:46:29.375 --> 00:46:29.895]  What do they do?
[00:46:29.915 --> 00:46:31.817]  Just like with amnesty, they say it doesn't exist.
[00:46:31.877 --> 00:46:33.458]  It's what a pack of criminals do.
[00:46:34.938 --> 00:46:37.640]  I have articles here in front of me where they say we are conspiracy theorists.
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:43.023]  Now, the call to ban free speech on talk radio, they're saying it doesn't exist.
[00:46:44.144 --> 00:46:44.784]  Which is standard.
[00:46:44.804 --> 00:46:46.505]  It's standard military procedure.
[00:46:46.605 --> 00:46:47.026]  To lie.
[00:46:47.346 --> 00:46:48.066]  To run stealth.
[00:46:48.647 --> 00:46:50.248]  Stealth bomber tries to lie to radar.
[00:46:51.228 --> 00:46:52.689]  They paint camouflage on tanks.
[00:46:52.769 --> 00:46:54.050]  It's part of deceiving the guy.
[00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:58.913]  Pretty soon, they'll deny there's even camouflage on tanks so there's no deception in military operations.
[00:46:59.981 --> 00:47:07.163]  Again, and then you just hesitate long enough or people rationalize what's going on and then nothing happens.
[00:47:08.244 --> 00:47:13.945]  England has called and is now moving to ban internet websites out of their country of any type of news or information.
[00:47:14.365 --> 00:47:16.526]  They're calling for arrest and the shutdown.
[00:47:17.666 --> 00:47:29.450]  They are, and many other forms of free speech, they're going under EU treaty that bans most forms of free speech by fiat with no parliamentary approval.
[00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:37.043]  Uh, a week and a half ago, InHop was in an elevator with Hillary and Feinstein.
[00:47:37.063 --> 00:47:39.549]  They were talking about how they wanted to ban talk radio and free speech.
[00:47:41.679 --> 00:47:45.140]  And then they moved hardcore and then said it was all a conspiracy and didn't exist.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:52.022]  Then since then, Pelosi, Hillary, Feinstein, and Boxer have all gone on TV and called for restrictions on talk radio.
[00:47:52.362 --> 00:47:54.143]  Now that's going to be selectively enforced.
[00:47:54.203 --> 00:47:58.424]  All the liberals are on my websites and message boards going, well Alex, isn't this reasonable?
[00:47:58.444 --> 00:47:59.924]  I mean, Rush Limbaugh's a hate monger.
[00:48:00.504 --> 00:48:01.705]  He'll never be restricted.
[00:48:01.885 --> 00:48:02.225]  I will.
[00:48:02.425 --> 00:48:02.845]  You will.
[00:48:04.125 --> 00:48:07.906]  Just like they, you know, restrict pro-life people and anti-war demonstrators.
[00:48:07.966 --> 00:48:10.167]  It's anybody who's really out there protesting.
[00:48:10.746 --> 00:48:12.607]  Either you're for the First Amendment or you're against it.
[00:48:12.888 --> 00:48:13.188]  Okay?
[00:48:13.468 --> 00:48:18.051]  They're telling churches coast-to-coast, liberal, conservative, it doesn't matter, that they can't have an opinion on the war.
[00:48:19.152 --> 00:48:21.493]  This is a new age of darkness.
[00:48:21.533 --> 00:48:25.436]  A massive frontal assault on free speech.
[00:48:25.876 --> 00:48:31.800]  By the way, folks, if you went to New York without a permit with 50,000 people, they would attack you with armored vehicles just like Tiananmen Square.
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.381]  America's now like China.
[00:48:33.581 --> 00:48:34.682]  Do you understand that?
[00:48:37.163 --> 00:48:39.305]  They just haven't taken on bigwigs like me yet.
[00:48:40.814 --> 00:48:41.574]  You understand that?
[00:48:41.594 --> 00:48:48.276]  That's why our media doesn't criticize Tiananmen Square anymore from 1989.
[00:48:50.237 --> 00:48:51.177]  This is the attack.
[00:48:51.497 --> 00:48:52.657]  This is the real deal.
[00:48:53.057 --> 00:48:54.358]  It's happening right now.
[00:48:55.158 --> 00:48:56.818]  This is the real deal.
[00:48:57.178 --> 00:48:58.519]  This is America.
[00:48:58.899 --> 00:49:00.499]  This is the real world.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.020]  This is the reality.
[00:49:06.401 --> 00:49:08.522]  This is what we're facing as a society.
[00:49:09.382 --> 00:49:10.062]  As a republic.
[00:49:11.579 --> 00:49:13.920]  House proposes ban on fairness doctrine funding.
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:18.602]  Meanwhile, there's hundreds of news articles literally out there saying either it doesn't exist or it's a good idea.
[00:49:20.003 --> 00:49:23.504]  In fact, the same publications will say it doesn't exist, but then they'll say it's a good idea.
[00:49:23.825 --> 00:49:26.446]  Again, using military techniques of lying.
[00:49:28.587 --> 00:49:29.407]  That's all this is.
[00:49:30.668 --> 00:49:35.290]  And now, they're on Fox News, they're everywhere, calling for attacks on free speech.
[00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:38.071]  And the government regulating what you can and can't say.
[00:49:39.062 --> 00:49:40.824]  Let me just tell all the idiot bureaucrats something.
[00:49:40.844 --> 00:49:46.729]  Just because your thug bosses, your mafia bosses, say you've got a right to do this, doesn't mean it's the case.
[00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:49.371]  And I welcome your attempt.
[00:49:49.391 --> 00:49:50.833]  You just show everybody who you are.
[00:49:51.353 --> 00:49:52.494]  That's all you're doing.
[00:49:54.276 --> 00:50:00.241]  You just keep on squeezing, and you keep on pushing, and you keep on showing everybody exactly who and what you are.
[00:50:02.523 --> 00:50:04.325]  Fairness doctrine, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:04.465 --> 00:50:05.466]  Fairness doctrine.
[00:50:07.913 --> 00:50:17.220]  All of this with the backdrop of the Attorney General saying he's above the law, the President saying he's above all laws, and the Vice President saying he's not part of the executive.
[00:50:20.743 --> 00:50:23.465]  I mean, we are, we're on the razor's edge.
[00:50:23.605 --> 00:50:27.108]  And I get mad because I'm a human being and I have rights.
[00:50:27.228 --> 00:50:28.309]  And let me tell you something, folks.
[00:50:28.329 --> 00:50:36.996]  When you've got somebody right out of The Sopranos, in a uniform, laughing and snickering and giggling and enjoying destroying America,
[00:50:39.025 --> 00:50:40.306]  It demands we stand up.
[00:50:40.346 --> 00:50:44.249]  You know how many people fought and died for our free speech and our freedom of the press?
[00:50:45.489 --> 00:50:49.812]  And a bunch of monkeys in police uniforms and their thug bosses like Bloomberg?
[00:50:52.034 --> 00:50:56.997]  Posing with that pig Schwarzenegger with a Nazi belt buckle?
[00:50:57.497 --> 00:50:59.219]  Let me tell you something, you criminal trash.
[00:50:59.639 --> 00:51:01.180]  When we take this country back, we're going to arrest you.
[00:51:04.219 --> 00:51:09.707]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.068 --> 00:51:17.719]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.402 --> 00:51:25.446]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.846 --> 00:51:37.332]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.592 --> 00:51:41.074]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.555 --> 00:51:43.496]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.816 --> 00:51:47.598]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.175 --> 00:52:04.337]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:04.377 --> 00:52:08.419]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:11.100]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:13.501]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:13.681 --> 00:52:22.125]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:22.205 --> 00:52:23.506]  The brookie light is different.
[00:52:23.646 --> 00:52:27.688]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:27.708 --> 00:52:28.168]  We're good to go!
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:51.123]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.

[00:52:52.785 --> 00:52:53.726]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:00.859 --> 00:53:02.580]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:06.502]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:06.822 --> 00:53:09.043]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:53:09.563 --> 00:53:15.766]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:15.926 --> 00:53:20.829]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.029 --> 00:53:29.993]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:36.395]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[00:54:03.676 --> 00:54:20.913]  The creature man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry The interest is up and the stock market's down And you only get mugged if you go downtown
[00:54:26.624 --> 00:54:32.131]  I live back in the woods you see, a woman and the kids and the dogs and me.
[00:54:37.083 --> 00:54:42.668]  I've got a shotgun, a rifle, and a four-wheel drive, and a country boy can survive.
[00:54:42.688 --> 00:54:47.092]  Country folks can survive.
[00:54:47.613 --> 00:54:55.560]  Not anymore, because because federal regulators are going on every piece of property demanding to see everybody's animals, harassing them.
[00:54:55.740 --> 00:55:02.226]  It's all about shutting you down, all about getting you in their system, all about blowing out the economy, all about consolidating.
[00:55:04.023 --> 00:55:10.248]  All across the country, old ladies who've gotten about 90% paid on their loan, the house they lived in 25 years.
[00:55:11.549 --> 00:55:15.071]  The banks are repossessing and saying, we want the last 20 grand right now.
[00:55:15.091 --> 00:55:19.634]  And sometime before they can even pay it off, they're snatching the house and laughing.
[00:55:19.995 --> 00:55:24.558]  Those bankers that were their friends 25 years ago when they signed on the note.
[00:55:24.898 --> 00:55:26.739]  And it's going to happen to all these cops too.
[00:55:26.799 --> 00:55:28.901]  That's the one enjoyment I've got.
[00:55:29.835 --> 00:55:35.437]  But frankly, most days I'm not in a nasty enough mood to even take pleasure in knowing how they're going to lose everything they got, too.
[00:55:36.457 --> 00:55:36.777]  Yeah.
[00:55:37.538 --> 00:55:38.298]  But you don't care.
[00:55:38.458 --> 00:55:40.939]  Just your hate of America will keep your heart warm, won't it?
[00:55:41.859 --> 00:55:44.460]  At least you get to bully a few scum around, huh?
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:47.401]  Yeah, I'm in a very angry mood right now.
[00:55:47.421 --> 00:55:49.922]  We got the fake bombing news out of England.
[00:55:49.942 --> 00:55:51.442]  This is totally staged, as usual.
[00:55:51.822 --> 00:55:53.863]  Key stories up on PrisonPlanet.com on that.
[00:55:54.223 --> 00:55:56.344]  Huge financial news, which I will cover today.
[00:55:56.884 --> 00:55:58.245]  But right now, let's go to some calls.
[00:55:58.365 --> 00:55:59.265]  Joe in New York.
[00:56:00.689 --> 00:56:02.070]  Welcome to the Airwaves, Joe.
[00:56:02.711 --> 00:56:03.391]  Alex, how are you doing?
[00:56:03.431 --> 00:56:04.512]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:56:04.752 --> 00:56:06.474]  What do you think about the new thing in New York?
[00:56:06.554 --> 00:56:09.556]  Where they just, oh, we're not going to let anybody videotape the police or anything.
[00:56:09.576 --> 00:56:10.657]  We just rule everything.
[00:56:11.217 --> 00:56:12.719]  Yeah, I got your phone number that you gave me.
[00:56:12.819 --> 00:56:15.701]  As soon as I get up here, I'm going to be calling Bloomberg, and this is unacceptable.
[00:56:15.801 --> 00:56:17.342]  I just can't believe New York is going to go for this.
[00:56:17.402 --> 00:56:17.883]  It's crazy.
[00:56:19.024 --> 00:56:22.687]  Well, I mean, how did New York, because I was in New York a long time ago, and the police didn't act like thugs.
[00:56:22.727 --> 00:56:23.347]  What happened there?
[00:56:24.528 --> 00:56:24.908]  I don't know.
[00:56:24.968 --> 00:56:26.149]  It just changed ever since 9-11.
[00:56:26.289 --> 00:56:26.950]  It's crazy.
[00:56:29.073 --> 00:56:32.114]  Again, 9-11 is their excuse to treat us like slaves.
[00:56:32.514 --> 00:56:33.454]  Nothing to do with safety.
[00:56:33.494 --> 00:56:33.874]  Go ahead.
[00:56:34.495 --> 00:56:36.055]  Well, I was going to say this amnesty thing, too.
[00:56:36.075 --> 00:56:36.795]  This isn't dead.
[00:56:36.815 --> 00:56:38.896]  They're going to do this after the election.
[00:56:38.936 --> 00:56:43.037]  They don't want to be finger-pointing, saying, don't vote for so-and-so because he voted for amnesty.
[00:56:43.057 --> 00:56:45.318]  So it's all going to happen after the 2008 election.
[00:56:45.658 --> 00:56:46.258]  It's back again.
[00:56:46.278 --> 00:56:47.378]  It's going to be right back in our face.
[00:56:48.699 --> 00:56:50.039]  That's what they say, yeah.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:51.180]  Yep.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.040]  Well, keep up the great work, Alex.
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:53.640]  Love your show.
[00:56:55.101 --> 00:56:55.821]  Is that it, my friend?
[00:56:56.787 --> 00:57:07.750]  Um, well one last thing, I was on their website for the eFoods Direct and they say to keep your food, even if it's out of date, keep it Alex, don't throw it away because if someone comes and tries to steal your food, give them the bad stuff.
[00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:12.211]  So don't, if it's 10 years old or 12 years old, keep it because you can always give it away to someone who's trying to rob you.
[00:57:12.391 --> 00:57:21.514]  Well that's what you do, you have the bad stuff up front and the good stuff hidden, just like you have a couple old junky guns for the uh, thugs that come by to get them, the officers.
[00:57:22.253 --> 00:57:24.334]  All right, thank you so much for the call.
[00:57:24.895 --> 00:57:26.816]  Bruce, where are you calling us from, Bruce?
[00:57:27.937 --> 00:57:29.038]  Calling from Colorado.
[00:57:29.358 --> 00:57:29.718]  Welcome.
[00:57:30.979 --> 00:57:43.367]  Well, what I want to call about is that I had some talks with some people in Florida, and what they're thinking about lately is finding counties around the country that are relatively safe.
[00:57:44.375 --> 00:57:49.376]  I've been hearing this forever, like the New Hampshire Free State Project, or Go Here, Go There.
[00:57:49.396 --> 00:58:01.398]  I mean, I'm not going to poo-poo trying to get out of major urban centers, but as for all the patriots moving one place, you'll end up with king rat opportunists trying to boss everybody around.
[00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:02.039]  I don't know.
[00:58:02.659 --> 00:58:04.219]  Yeah, that sort of thing does happen.
[00:58:04.279 --> 00:58:09.240]  But what I'm really calling about is how to get your county relatively safer.
[00:58:10.101 --> 00:58:13.102]  And I've got a section of the website called Save the County.
[00:58:13.462 --> 00:58:13.842]  Oh, great.
[00:58:14.062 --> 00:58:14.782]  Plug your website.
[00:58:14.802 --> 00:58:15.422]  We're going to move on.
[00:58:15.942 --> 00:58:16.302]  All right.
[00:58:16.342 --> 00:58:17.242]  It's Bruce Kettler.
[00:58:17.282 --> 00:58:21.443]  You spell it B-R-U-C-E-K-E-T-T-L-E-R dot com.
[00:58:21.543 --> 00:58:22.023]  All right.
[00:58:22.063 --> 00:58:22.663]  Send me your info.
[00:58:22.723 --> 00:58:23.703]  I might have you on as a guest.
[00:58:23.743 --> 00:58:24.604]  I appreciate your call.
[00:58:26.164 --> 00:58:26.464]  Okay.
[00:58:26.484 --> 00:58:28.364]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:28.424 --> 00:58:29.304]  And I know I'm bad.
[00:58:30.304 --> 00:58:36.506]  I really shouldn't be upset with trying to claim we have no First Amendment in this country and open attacks on talk radio and everything else.
[00:58:37.006 --> 00:58:39.006]  I should just, you know, First Amendment's evil.
[00:58:41.027 --> 00:58:45.915]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.592 --> 00:59:01.796]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.416 --> 00:59:03.277]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.998 --> 00:59:04.899]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.559 --> 00:59:09.403]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.743 --> 00:59:13.907]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.547 --> 00:59:18.531]  The FCC is officially bringing forward a proposal
[00:59:20.609 --> 00:59:23.031]  To ban pre-speech in the United States.
[00:59:23.411 --> 00:59:30.257]  Openly, on its face, and it's being debated like it's reasonable, but then when you criticize it, the media says it doesn't exist.
[00:59:30.277 --> 00:59:31.117]  It's like amnesty.
[00:59:32.658 --> 00:59:37.142]  Again, they've shifted it into complete lying and military operations, psych warfare against us.
[00:59:39.143 --> 00:59:41.605]  We've got incredible financial news I will cover.
[00:59:41.645 --> 00:59:42.866]  It's been piling up all week.
[00:59:42.906 --> 00:59:48.671]  We've got this bombing situation in England that I'm going to boil down and go over in the next segment.
[00:59:49.654 --> 00:59:53.635]  I know that we have Maggie and George and Matt and many others that are holding.
[00:59:53.875 --> 00:59:55.295]  We're going to take a lot of calls today at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:55.535 --> 01:00:08.817]  Matt Kazee, who's a 9-11 truther and also reported for Infowars.com from the Browns property in New Hampshire and also was there covering things for us with the Virginia Tech shooting in Blacksburg.
[01:00:09.738 --> 01:00:10.558]  Matt, what's going on?
[01:00:11.538 --> 01:00:13.178]  Well, I've got a couple of updates for you, Alex.
[01:00:13.738 --> 01:00:18.219]  I just finished a three-hour documentary on my experiences going up and staying with the Browns.
[01:00:18.999 --> 01:00:24.204]  And we've launched a website for that, if people want to check that out, it's 33rdparallel.tv.
[01:00:25.466 --> 01:00:28.348]  And I had a message from Ed and Elaine, they wanted me to thank you.
[01:00:29.009 --> 01:00:30.511]  They can't thank you enough, Alex.
[01:00:30.551 --> 01:00:35.576]  You've really gone the extra mile, and that's exactly what we need in this country, and they just wanted me to thank you.
[01:00:35.696 --> 01:00:36.677]  And I thank you too, Alex.
[01:00:37.317 --> 01:00:38.478]  Well, thank you, Matt.
[01:00:38.879 --> 01:00:40.681]  What do you think about the New York police going,
[01:00:42.485 --> 01:00:46.849]  The Film Society says all videotaping, all photography is filmmaking.
[01:00:47.170 --> 01:00:50.593]  You've got to have a million dollar permit to do it.
[01:00:51.334 --> 01:00:54.817]  Of course the law is if it's news gathering or free speech they can't stop you.
[01:00:55.097 --> 01:00:57.219]  But the thug cops don't care, they'll still arrest you.
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:58.660]  What do you think about this?
[01:00:59.701 --> 01:01:01.863]  Well then they've got to hold themselves to the same standards.
[01:01:01.923 --> 01:01:05.847]  If they're going to videotape us everywhere we go in public, it's ridiculous.
[01:01:06.272 --> 01:01:08.013]  I dare him to try and enforce that.
[01:01:08.033 --> 01:01:08.913]  That's all I've got to say.
[01:01:09.294 --> 01:01:13.676]  Well, there's an assault on free speech, though, across the board.
[01:01:13.856 --> 01:01:21.399]  I mean, there is an attack on liberty and freedom at every single level, from every angle.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.722]  I mean, it is so massive, and there are so many
[01:01:27.561 --> 01:01:28.402]  Passage to this.
[01:01:28.722 --> 01:01:30.623]  All over the world they're attacking free speech.
[01:01:30.663 --> 01:01:31.544]  They're making their move.
[01:01:31.904 --> 01:01:35.047]  And Matt, that shows me it's because we're having an effect.
[01:01:35.467 --> 01:01:35.907]  That's it.
[01:01:36.148 --> 01:01:37.088]  They're scared to death.
[01:01:37.329 --> 01:01:38.429]  They have to make their move now.
[01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:41.051]  But they try and they try and shut that thing down.
[01:01:41.111 --> 01:01:43.193]  It's going to do what everything else has been doing.
[01:01:43.213 --> 01:01:43.913]  Blow up in their face.
[01:01:44.254 --> 01:01:48.377]  Hey Alex, I've got two Virginia Tech updates that I think you will find very enlightening.
[01:01:49.218 --> 01:01:55.002]  Okay, supposedly we've been continuing to have bomb threats in the very buildings where the bomb threats always were.
[01:01:55.774 --> 01:02:07.247]  Supposedly behind a door with a sign on it that said bomb inside they found a videotape of a guy in a black trench coat who swore to avenge Cho.
[01:02:08.949 --> 01:02:11.833]  And one other thing that you're going to find very interesting
[01:02:12.702 --> 01:02:20.789]  Now they, I'd reported on this before, a couple of weeks after the shooting, they sent divers down into a pond, which around here everybody calls the Duck Pond.
[01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:22.951]  Now here's what's interesting.
[01:02:23.251 --> 01:02:27.174]  Just two days ago, two or three days ago, they drained the Duck Pond.
[01:02:27.495 --> 01:02:32.519]  They sent in people with metal detectors because they're looking for a missing hard drive.
[01:02:35.931 --> 01:02:38.072]  Well, I mean, we know that thing was staged.
[01:02:38.092 --> 01:02:39.512]  They've got a mine control base there.
[01:02:39.552 --> 01:02:41.953]  You've confirmed a DARPA mine control base.
[01:02:42.413 --> 01:02:44.373]  Blacksburg is known for CIA control.
[01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:49.034]  They have a CIA liaison program there with the students at the school.
[01:02:49.355 --> 01:02:53.436]  They have weird ROTC people running around in camouflage constantly doing drills.
[01:02:53.976 --> 01:02:56.236]  They had shooting drills in the months before.
[01:02:56.276 --> 01:02:59.617]  They had another shooting tied to ROTC there, a mass shooting.
[01:03:00.117 --> 01:03:02.738]  Yeah, I'm officially going on the record and saying,
[01:03:03.174 --> 01:03:05.537]  From all my investigations point to 100% black op.
[01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:08.857]  Oh, of course!
[01:03:08.897 --> 01:03:09.918]  Look at this England thing!
[01:03:09.938 --> 01:03:10.478]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:10.738 --> 01:03:18.923]  You know, it's a smoking car, and then, oh, on a website, someone said, today I say rejoice by Allah, London shall be bombed.
[01:03:19.183 --> 01:03:21.544]  Well, why is our government bringing in record numbers of Muslims?
[01:03:21.565 --> 01:03:23.526]  I mean, let's say they're really gonna bomb us, they're gonna do this.
[01:03:23.846 --> 01:03:34.692]  Two weeks ago, the White House says we're gonna have suicide bombings in England and the U.S., and then magically they foil this one, and MI5's been caught hundreds of times staging attacks and saying the IRA did it.
[01:03:35.193 --> 01:03:37.056]  They were caught running the 7-7 attacks.
[01:03:37.416 --> 01:03:38.538]  It's the government, period.
[01:03:39.139 --> 01:03:40.722]  Hey Matt, I appreciate you.
[01:03:40.742 --> 01:03:42.364]  Stay there, I want to ask you a question during the break.
[01:03:42.605 --> 01:03:45.590]  We're going to come back, get into the bombing, get into a bunch of other news.
[01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:46.051]  Stay with us.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:01.829]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.209 --> 01:04:09.821]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.535 --> 01:04:17.580]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:29.407]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.727 --> 01:04:33.270]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:35.631]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.951 --> 01:04:39.794]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:53.224 --> 01:05:54.364]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD.
[01:05:54.384 --> 01:05:56.785]  I'm the Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis.
[01:05:56.905 --> 01:05:59.886]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[01:05:59.946 --> 01:06:00.626]  is a real thing.
[01:06:00.706 --> 01:06:07.588]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[01:06:07.708 --> 01:06:12.969]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.910]  We're good to go!

[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:51.702]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[01:06:52.923 --> 01:06:57.987]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.328 --> 01:07:00.610]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:11.042 --> 01:07:15.224]  A bunch of calls right now.
[01:07:15.244 --> 01:07:15.504]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:15.544 --> 01:07:16.985]  Then I'm going to...
[01:07:19.878 --> 01:07:25.502]  Get into the latest bombing in London, right when Gordon Brown, Mr. New World Order comes into power.
[01:07:26.403 --> 01:07:33.148]  Every indicator, every signature, every earmark, every hallmark, every wavelength, all the MO, it is a total op.
[01:07:34.609 --> 01:07:38.412]  Now there may be a mentally ill Muslim who was in government custody.
[01:07:38.853 --> 01:07:43.036]  About 10% of the time, or 12% or so, it's one of those.
[01:07:43.056 --> 01:07:44.197]  I've actually done numbers before.
[01:07:45.631 --> 01:07:46.092]  I don't know.
[01:08:05.836 --> 01:08:10.538]  Or they find eighteen-year-old Muslims and deliver ammonium nitrate to them in Toronto.
[01:08:10.578 --> 01:08:11.318]  I mean, you know the M.O.
[01:08:11.358 --> 01:08:12.039]  a thousand times.
[01:08:12.639 --> 01:08:19.662]  Or they create fake Klan groups that are so drunk that they literally can't even get out of their trailers, and then they claim they were planning to assault the Capitol and kill the President.
[01:08:20.982 --> 01:08:23.443]  I mean, I've seen this hundreds and hundreds of times, no exaggeration.
[01:08:24.083 --> 01:08:25.384]  So, classic M.O.
[01:08:25.564 --> 01:08:30.366]  and I'm just glad that the British were caught with their hot attack
[01:08:32.087 --> 01:08:42.131]  Their actual live attack of 7-7, so they've kind of backed off killing right now, and so they're just doing smug bomb stage defense.
[01:08:42.771 --> 01:08:44.571]  That's certainly a plus right there.
[01:08:45.852 --> 01:08:48.333]  But let's go to Maggie in Texas right now.
[01:08:48.393 --> 01:08:49.073]  Maggie, go ahead.
[01:08:49.713 --> 01:08:50.373]  Hello, Alex.
[01:08:50.954 --> 01:09:01.097]  Two days ago you were talking about an Austin videographer who had moved to Guatemala a few years ago to start a TV venture, and you were wondering what became of her.
[01:09:02.169 --> 01:09:07.432]  Well, I did a little research and I've found out how you can get in contact with her.
[01:09:07.713 --> 01:09:08.013]  Oh, good.
[01:09:08.033 --> 01:09:09.113]  Patricia Moore is doing good?
[01:09:10.434 --> 01:09:16.058]  From what I've found out, well, I have what I think is a fail-safe contact address, which I will send you.
[01:09:16.138 --> 01:09:18.739]  Is it to Erin?
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:24.363]  My impression is that she herself is okay, but that the venture failed.
[01:09:24.463 --> 01:09:29.766]  At least it doesn't exist under its original name because... Where does she live now?
[01:09:30.402 --> 01:09:33.733]  I don't know, but she has been seen recently in Texas.
[01:09:34.114 --> 01:09:36.281]  In fact, she was spotted recently in Austin.
[01:09:36.644 --> 01:09:38.144]  I don't know where she's actually living.
[01:09:38.184 --> 01:09:41.225]  Can you email me all that info to erin at infowars.com?
[01:09:41.546 --> 01:09:42.106]  I sure will.
[01:09:42.646 --> 01:09:44.226]  Yeah, no, she's a great lady.
[01:09:44.286 --> 01:09:51.428]  She shot video in Chiapas during the... and I mean, it's like people in grass huts burning with troops running around shooting.
[01:09:52.029 --> 01:09:52.769]  It's just amazing.
[01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:54.829]  I was just thinking, my God, that's powerful.
[01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:56.890]  And I wanted to get in contact with her.
[01:09:56.950 --> 01:10:00.731]  And I forget what I was paralleling it or dovetailing it with.
[01:10:01.011 --> 01:10:04.933]  Oh, just how journalists have to hide in third world police states.
[01:10:04.993 --> 01:10:05.733]  And I guess the U.S.
[01:10:05.793 --> 01:10:06.353]  is becoming that.
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:07.720]  Sounds like that.
[01:10:07.921 --> 01:10:09.582]  So this is opportune.
[01:10:09.642 --> 01:10:20.248]  I'll send you the email address of a relative of hers who does not live in Austin and what other information I came up with.
[01:10:20.628 --> 01:10:21.869]  Well that's really sweet of you Maggie.
[01:10:21.909 --> 01:10:22.429]  Anything else?
[01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:25.611]  No, not at this moment.
[01:10:27.443 --> 01:10:32.625]  Yeah, I would need to email Patricia because she's deaf, so I wouldn't be able to even talk to her over the phone.
[01:10:33.846 --> 01:10:34.846]  But thank you for doing that.
[01:10:34.866 --> 01:10:39.228]  What do you think about the New York Police saying they're going to not let anybody film anymore?
[01:10:39.608 --> 01:10:44.450]  You know, I saw that on Drudge Report last night, and I was thinking that it was horrible.
[01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:54.894]  I have a little digital camera that doesn't look like a video cam, though it is a video cam for YouTube-sized productions.
[01:10:55.996 --> 01:11:00.018]  And I like to keep that handy, but I suppose any camera will be suspect now.
[01:11:01.779 --> 01:11:07.743]  Well again, they're going to videotape us, they're going to prod us, they're going to search us, now not just in the airports, but on the streets of New York.
[01:11:08.083 --> 01:11:10.764]  First it was airports, then the trains, now the streets.
[01:11:11.325 --> 01:11:16.768]  And now they're talking frisk, or asking frisk, from Maryland to Texas.
[01:11:16.808 --> 01:11:19.109]  They literally just line you up and search you.
[01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:21.451]  I mean, it's just, this is not freedom!
[01:11:21.491 --> 01:11:22.991]  And knock and talks in Austin?
[01:11:23.291 --> 01:11:25.132]  Hey, mind if I search your house without a warrant?
[01:11:25.512 --> 01:11:27.352]  I mean, folks, this is, this is scary!
[01:11:28.633 --> 01:11:30.613]  Right, it's horrible, but it didn't surprise me.
[01:11:31.594 --> 01:11:34.594]  Absolutely, I appreciate you calling in, Maggie, and thanks for that info.
[01:11:36.495 --> 01:11:42.737]  Again, I've studied history, and once a country goes bad, once they start getting away with these basic things, there's no end.
[01:11:43.617 --> 01:11:46.558]  It almost always leads directly to mass murder.
[01:11:48.021 --> 01:11:49.761]  I would say 95% of the time.
[01:11:50.642 --> 01:11:55.082]  Their minimum, they take your pension funds, your houses, they call in your mortgages.
[01:11:55.102 --> 01:11:58.763]  I just can't believe they're doing it.
[01:11:59.263 --> 01:12:00.123]  I yell and scream.
[01:12:00.163 --> 01:12:04.924]  I'd be more effective if I tried to plead with the police and be nice to them, but I've just had it up to here.
[01:12:05.204 --> 01:12:06.425]  I just don't care anymore.
[01:12:06.445 --> 01:12:12.946]  I know there's a lot of good police and good people in government, but the government itself has gone bad and I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:12:16.084 --> 01:12:19.005]  I just can't handle seeing my country torn limb from limb anymore.
[01:12:20.866 --> 01:12:35.211]  You know, I was doing research on Alexander Shultz-Nietzsche and the Gulag Archipelago last night, and I was reading Encyclopedia Britannica, Wikipedia, a couple others, some university studies, and he estimated that a third of the people in St.
[01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:41.734]  Petersburg were taken to forced labor camps, and over half of them died.
[01:12:43.081 --> 01:12:52.264]  And then, and the Soviet records were released about a decade ago, he wrote that book back in the 60s, Gulag or Kapeluga, and they found, oh no, it was much worse than Shultz and Easton said from the census.
[01:12:56.765 --> 01:13:00.186]  The Russians killed around 35% of their population.
[01:13:00.986 --> 01:13:01.926]  Oh God almighty.
[01:13:03.467 --> 01:13:04.267]  It's hardcore.
[01:13:06.128 --> 01:13:10.409]  And then when I actually tracked down his own writings and tapes of Brzezinski,
[01:13:11.192 --> 01:13:18.494]  Saying, yeah, we supported Pol Pot, and he wouldn't have got through it if it wasn't for us, and he killed two million, and, you know, that's, that's, that's, you know, it's the way it is.
[01:13:19.355 --> 01:13:20.215]  Yeah, we supported that.
[01:13:20.235 --> 01:13:20.695]  Mm-hmm.
[01:13:20.895 --> 01:13:21.035]  Yeah.
[01:13:21.275 --> 01:13:22.516]  I'm the architect killing two million.
[01:13:22.536 --> 01:13:22.656]  Mm-hmm.
[01:13:24.076 --> 01:13:24.396]  Stop!
[01:13:24.496 --> 01:13:25.717]  I'm the architect killing millions.
[01:13:25.737 --> 01:13:26.397]  I'm gonna answer them.
[01:13:28.438 --> 01:13:31.959]  And they are the people that set up the architecture of this country today.
[01:13:35.157 --> 01:13:39.139]  24-7 they think about one thing, consolidating everything.
[01:13:39.579 --> 01:13:41.179]  It's called total supremacy.
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.020]  Hyper-dominance.
[01:13:45.001 --> 01:13:45.661]  You understand that?
[01:13:48.382 --> 01:13:51.603]  They literally, it's genetic with the elite.
[01:13:52.284 --> 01:13:54.464]  They want total dominance.
[01:13:55.005 --> 01:13:56.025]  They want it right now.
[01:13:57.406 --> 01:13:58.966]  And they're not playing games.
[01:14:02.868 --> 01:14:03.628]  It's savage.
[01:14:07.771 --> 01:14:17.120]  And the people running things, ran the Communists, ran the Nazis, they run the extermination squads in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia, all they want to do is kill you.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:18.100]  Okay?
[01:14:20.082 --> 01:14:20.983]  Do you expect me to talk?
[01:14:21.303 --> 01:14:22.965]  No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.
[01:14:26.148 --> 01:14:27.209]  That's saying from Dr. No.
[01:14:27.489 --> 01:14:28.610]  I mean, that is literally it.
[01:14:29.511 --> 01:14:30.331]  Do you expect me to talk?
[01:14:30.652 --> 01:14:31.593]  No, I expect you to die.
[01:14:31.613 --> 01:14:34.135]  Okay?
[01:14:35.299 --> 01:14:38.321]  They, it's their ultimate pleasure, the ultimate expression of power.
[01:14:38.701 --> 01:14:41.102]  They want to murder you and your family.
[01:14:41.142 --> 01:14:43.724]  The government wants to murder you.
[01:14:50.167 --> 01:14:51.968]  George in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:14:54.129 --> 01:14:54.409]  Yes.
[01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:55.890]  I'm kind of disappointed.
[01:14:55.930 --> 01:14:58.992]  I'm surprised you didn't try to get Sheriff Richard back on since
[01:14:59.625 --> 01:15:03.507]  It was the 10th year anniversary of him defeating the Brady Bill in the Supreme Court.
[01:15:03.867 --> 01:15:08.749]  Yeah, well, that was a big conspiracy plan of mine to try to suppress the Second Amendment.
[01:15:09.529 --> 01:15:16.872]  Yeah, I mean, you know, with all this police state talk, I'm surprised you didn't have him on, you know, trying to make sense of all this.
[01:15:17.532 --> 01:15:20.033]  I mean, I've been talking like some of my local police.
[01:15:20.294 --> 01:15:22.815]  I mean, are you wanting me to get aggressive with you?
[01:15:22.835 --> 01:15:24.375]  I mean, so I haven't done enough?
[01:15:24.755 --> 01:15:28.637]  I mean, are you really actually criticizing me for not having Sheriff Mack on?
[01:15:29.674 --> 01:15:32.195]  No, I mean, I'm just, I'm not really disappointed.
[01:15:32.215 --> 01:15:34.756]  I mean, you got a lot of guests you could put on.
[01:15:34.776 --> 01:15:36.197]  Why don't you just say, why don't you have him on?
[01:15:36.217 --> 01:15:38.478]  Actually, we put a call in to him a week ago.
[01:15:40.398 --> 01:15:40.598]  Ted?
[01:15:41.819 --> 01:15:42.799]  I'm sorry.
[01:15:42.859 --> 01:15:44.460]  No, you don't need to say sorry to me.
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:48.502]  It's just that, it's the attitude of, you need to do this, you need to do that.
[01:15:48.522 --> 01:15:50.723]  I mean, I'm doing my best here.
[01:15:52.143 --> 01:15:54.344]  I get calls every day, why aren't I having Ron Paul on more?
[01:15:54.864 --> 01:15:56.285]  Because he's busy and isn't coming on.
[01:15:56.305 --> 01:15:58.066]  Supposedly coming on next Thursday.
[01:16:04.764 --> 01:16:05.345]  Anything else, sir?
[01:16:06.486 --> 01:16:07.327]  Uh, no.
[01:16:07.367 --> 01:16:09.169]  Alright, thank you, Alex.
[01:16:09.569 --> 01:16:11.071]  Listen, ten years of Brady.
[01:16:13.493 --> 01:16:14.795]  But we still have the Brady Act, don't we?
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:22.242]  Look, I'm in a bad mood about what's happening to the First Amendment.
[01:16:23.023 --> 01:16:27.468]  I'm in a bad mood about what's happening to the country, and I'm not trying to get in a fight with you.
[01:16:29.702 --> 01:16:31.584]  George, okay, and if I sounded rude, I'm sorry.
[01:16:31.865 --> 01:16:34.728]  I can tell the callers are all being a little more rude and persnickety.
[01:16:35.109 --> 01:16:36.450]  We need to not tear each other apart.
[01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:42.798]  We're all mad about what's happening in the country, and we're like, basically like piranha together in a tank biting each other.
[01:16:43.368 --> 01:16:44.989]  We need to call Bloomberg's office.
[01:16:45.029 --> 01:16:53.396]  You want to get in somebody's face, you want to get angry at somebody, you want to complain, call this pig, this New World Order, America-hating, enemy of America.
[01:16:53.876 --> 01:17:09.448]  You call this piece of trash up at the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater, and Broadcasting at 1697 Broadway, 6th Floor Entrance, 53rd Street, phone number 212-489-6710, and tell them you're mad about them wanting to destroy the First Amendment.
[01:17:10.109 --> 01:17:13.570]  Okay, so thank you, George, and yes, we are trying to get Sheriff Mack on the show.
[01:17:14.591 --> 01:17:16.831]  I heard him on Gary Brownfield yesterday here on Genesis.
[01:17:16.891 --> 01:17:17.772]  I want to get him on.
[01:17:19.112 --> 01:17:20.673]  Let's just not get at each other's throats, okay?
[01:17:20.713 --> 01:17:21.593]  We're all doing what we can do.
[01:17:23.673 --> 01:17:24.874]  Matt, you're on the air.
[01:17:24.914 --> 01:17:25.814]  Matt, where are you calling from?
[01:17:25.834 --> 01:17:34.157]  Okay, we'll just go to Reese in New York when we get back after this break.
[01:17:35.973 --> 01:17:39.016]  You know, I understand people are upset, and I understand you're mad, okay?
[01:17:39.456 --> 01:17:43.840]  But, uh, you need to learn to keep the stuff downrange, and, uh, me too.
[01:17:45.922 --> 01:17:46.202]  Me too.
[01:17:46.262 --> 01:17:47.784]  At least you're upset, though, and angry.
[01:17:48.785 --> 01:17:55.030]  A lot of people in this movement just think it's like some kind of social club to swagger around, and... This is life or death.
[01:17:58.153 --> 01:18:01.296]  You notice the Supreme Court struck down the Brady Bill as unconstitutional?
[01:18:04.187 --> 01:18:22.179]  But they'd always planned to go to an instant check, which is just nothing but a federal database, and they've used those federal databases now as the larger Matrix Threat Database and Total Information Awareness Network database, and they passed the biggest gun control act since 68, two weeks ago, with NRA support.
[01:18:25.922 --> 01:18:30.945]  Again, they're attacking the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Fourth, the Tenth, the country itself.
[01:18:31.385 --> 01:18:32.366]  They're making their move.
[01:18:35.422 --> 01:18:38.144]  They're making their move right now to destroy this country.
[01:18:40.905 --> 01:18:45.288]  By the way, a whole separate issue that I witnessed last night driving back to work at about 8 o'clock.
[01:18:46.089 --> 01:18:48.710]  I saw illegal aliens engaging in road rage everywhere.
[01:18:49.731 --> 01:18:51.512]  I'll tell you that story later too if I have time.

[01:19:53.948 --> 01:19:58.011]  Hi, this is Tom Andrew with Midas Resources, your source for gold and silver.
[01:19:58.651 --> 01:20:03.535]  Friday, June 1st, gold closed up $10 per ounce and silver closed up 32 cents per ounce.
[01:20:03.835 --> 01:20:07.878]  Significant daily gains in precious metals are not uncommon during volatile times.

[01:20:21.879 --> 01:20:28.502]  Precious Metals has always preserved purchasing power during times of confiscatory taxation and rampant inflation.
[01:20:29.102 --> 01:20:35.665]  Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan predicts a recession of alarming magnitude due to increasing budget and trade deficits.
[01:20:36.306 --> 01:20:43.374]  Listen folks, the current economic system is like a game of financial musical chairs.

[01:20:57.943 --> 01:21:00.865]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:21:01.185 --> 01:21:03.746]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:21:04.126 --> 01:21:08.928]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:21:09.328 --> 01:21:14.691]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:21:14.991 --> 01:21:17.952]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[01:21:18.132 --> 01:21:18.712]  We're good to go.
[01:21:41.363 --> 01:21:41.523]  Yes.

[01:21:53.511 --> 01:21:53.911]  Attention!

[01:23:03.747 --> 01:23:08.711]  I'm gonna go to Reese, Danny, Ryan, Mark, Wesley, Wellington, many others that are patiently holding.
[01:23:08.771 --> 01:23:11.733]  Coming up here, I need to get into some of the news right now.
[01:23:29.065 --> 01:23:38.130]  Before I do that, if you want to understand the police state, you need to get my Police State Trilogy to witness the Marines trying to take your children away from you and put you in concentration camps.
[01:23:39.171 --> 01:23:40.771]  Yeah, we got them on tape in mid-minning.
[01:23:40.792 --> 01:23:41.552]  It's for America.
[01:23:42.252 --> 01:23:43.553]  Long before 9-11, by the way.
[01:23:44.814 --> 01:23:46.695]  And they've got large corps trained to do it.
[01:23:46.715 --> 01:23:50.537]  They'll never get away with it because we've preemptively exposed them, but they're still going to try.
[01:23:50.557 --> 01:23:50.997]  Don't worry.
[01:23:51.898 --> 01:23:53.218]  What are you against the Marines?
[01:23:53.298 --> 01:23:54.739]  I'm for breaking up families.
[01:23:54.759 --> 01:23:55.940]  That's because I'm for the troops.
[01:23:56.918 --> 01:24:00.021]  I'm not for the troops when they turn into Nazi agents of death, no.
[01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:01.943]  That's the whole point.
[01:24:02.944 --> 01:24:06.087]  Hell, dare the General Staff in Germany go after Hitler.
[01:24:06.828 --> 01:24:08.810]  They were against the military.
[01:24:10.972 --> 01:24:12.874]  I just hope you'll get my Police State Trilogy.
[01:24:12.954 --> 01:24:18.960]  I hope you'll get Terror Storm, the special edition we're now putting out available at InfoWars.com.
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.282]  I hope you'll get the DVDs and aggressively
[01:24:22.285 --> 01:24:23.026]  Make copies.
[01:24:23.286 --> 01:24:24.707]  Angrily make copies.
[01:24:25.228 --> 01:24:26.889]  Militarily make copies.
[01:24:27.570 --> 01:24:30.012]  Because this is how we're fighting the enemy with the truth.
[01:24:30.432 --> 01:24:34.395]  And we're going to defeat them and we're going to win the hearts and minds of the people.
[01:24:34.876 --> 01:24:37.338]  We're going to unlock and empower their minds with the truth.
[01:24:37.358 --> 01:24:45.284]  You know, the globalists, it's all about dumbing people down and destroying them and confusing them and getting them blown out and broke and destroyed.
[01:24:45.324 --> 01:24:46.145]  We're here to empower.
[01:24:48.283 --> 01:24:49.383]  We're here to crush evil.
[01:24:49.423 --> 01:24:51.544]  We're here to smash them and run right over them.
[01:24:52.064 --> 01:24:55.585]  And we're here to stop wallowing around in front of them, lying on our bellies.
[01:24:57.806 --> 01:24:58.986]  I want you to get Terror Storm.
[01:24:59.026 --> 01:25:00.647]  I want you to get Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[01:25:00.687 --> 01:25:07.389]  I want you to get Riddles in Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C., and the 2nd Volume of Secret Mystery Series, Part 2.
[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:12.581]  Explorers of the highly controversial subject of America's capital.
[01:25:12.641 --> 01:25:15.741]  Was the city built to reflect the majesty of American freedom?
[01:25:16.301 --> 01:25:18.082]  Or the hidden agenda of secret societies?
[01:25:18.582 --> 01:25:23.063]  With every major cornerstone laid by Freemasons, was the city built in a Masonic pattern?
[01:25:23.943 --> 01:25:24.603]  Interesting film.
[01:25:24.623 --> 01:25:26.063]  You need to have riddles in stone.
[01:25:26.083 --> 01:25:27.783]  The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C.
[01:25:28.864 --> 01:25:36.245]  You need to get all the great 9-11 books and other videos we carry about other researchers at info.wars.com.
[01:25:38.507 --> 01:25:40.528]  And let's say you've already got some of my videos.
[01:25:40.548 --> 01:25:41.948]  You already know all about the New World Order.
[01:25:42.068 --> 01:25:46.890]  Well, how about you buy some of the videos to make copies of them to give them to others to wake them up.
[01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:48.890]  This is a race against time.
[01:25:49.530 --> 01:25:50.571]  We're having an effect.
[01:25:51.571 --> 01:25:54.372]  But it is sudden death over time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:54.932 --> 01:25:56.253]  This is not a game.
[01:25:57.033 --> 01:25:59.234]  I'm literally sick right now with anger.
[01:26:00.254 --> 01:26:01.274]  I'm totally upset.
[01:26:01.294 --> 01:26:03.875]  And I try not to be.
[01:26:03.995 --> 01:26:06.936]  I just can't help it anymore.
[01:26:09.691 --> 01:26:14.553]  Every time I just hope for signs that we're not going into total tyranny, it just gets worse by the minute.
[01:26:16.894 --> 01:26:20.316]  And so many of the fools going along with it don't realize they're destroying their own future.
[01:26:20.356 --> 01:26:20.956]  So listen to me.
[01:26:21.396 --> 01:26:22.597]  Infowars.com.
[01:26:22.717 --> 01:26:23.837]  Go get the videos.
[01:26:24.297 --> 01:26:25.318]  That's how you support us.
[01:26:25.338 --> 01:26:26.298]  That's how we operate.
[01:26:26.318 --> 01:26:27.559]  That's how we fight the New World Order.
[01:26:31.992 --> 01:26:38.874]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139 888-253-3139 or you can write to me I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100 Austin Texas 78704 or 888-253-3139 Then of course there's PrisonPlanet.tv as well PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:27:00.695 --> 01:27:04.919]  Great activist who will go there and download all the films in super high quality, burn them to disk.
[01:27:05.399 --> 01:27:10.844]  The weekly TV shows, the in-studio interviews, the Sunday show we videotape, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:27:11.905 --> 01:27:13.226]  Fifteen cents a day, folks.
[01:27:13.807 --> 01:27:15.909]  And I want to buy a bunch of really expensive servers.
[01:27:17.610 --> 01:27:19.812]  Each one's like the mortgage payment on a mansion.
[01:27:21.393 --> 01:27:27.219]  Blowing every bit of cash we've got in reserves just so we can meet the goals of what people
[01:27:28.204 --> 01:27:34.828]  People visit the sites, they watch the videos, they see the stuff, but it just doesn't pay for itself without you buying the videos and supporting us.
[01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:39.471]  And the advertisers I take on to fund the bandwidth and the employees here.
[01:27:39.491 --> 01:27:43.634]  And yeah, I'm not whining about it, we just need your support in this fight.
[01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:54.240]  Alright, uh... The London situation, let me...
[01:27:55.742 --> 01:27:57.563]  This news is just starting to really make me sick.
[01:27:58.184 --> 01:28:00.305]  I should have also only got like four hours sleep last night.
[01:28:00.325 --> 01:28:01.106]  I gotta quit doing that.
[01:28:01.126 --> 01:28:03.907]  Trying to finish endgame.
[01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:11.833]  I'm just, I'm already physically getting angry just thinking about going to New York and having scum tell me I can't videotape on 9-11.
[01:28:13.033 --> 01:28:13.834]  Filth of the Earth.
[01:28:15.895 --> 01:28:16.836]  Enemies of the Republic.
[01:28:19.253 --> 01:28:21.455]  All right, terror threat as London bombing foiled.
[01:28:21.475 --> 01:28:22.676]  We're going to get into that when we get back.
[01:28:22.716 --> 01:28:25.818]  We're going to get into banks set to call in a swath of loans.
[01:28:26.899 --> 01:28:27.880]  Another headline here.
[01:28:30.482 --> 01:28:33.764]  BIS warns of great depression dangers for credit spree.
[01:28:34.184 --> 01:28:40.049]  The Bank of International Settlements, the world's most prestigious financial body, says there's a good chance we're going to have a depression.
[01:28:43.712 --> 01:28:44.652]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.113 --> 01:28:46.634]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.595 --> 01:28:50.377]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.839 --> 01:28:56.321]  Do you know that you can go solar for under 1200 bucks now?
[01:28:56.862 --> 01:28:57.982]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[01:28:58.182 --> 01:29:02.345]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:29:02.926 --> 01:29:07.829]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[01:29:08.329 --> 01:29:14.754]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[01:29:15.493 --> 01:29:18.195]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[01:29:18.355 --> 01:29:28.323]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[01:29:28.603 --> 01:29:32.306]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[01:29:32.366 --> 01:29:38.851]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[01:29:39.031 --> 01:29:40.072]  Are you ready to go solar?
[01:29:40.272 --> 01:29:41.232]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.

[01:29:53.689 --> 01:29:57.451]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[01:29:57.851 --> 01:30:05.116]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[01:30:05.136 --> 01:30:16.562]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[01:30:16.642 --> 01:30:17.103]  Central.
[01:30:17.463 --> 01:30:23.046]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[01:30:23.386 --> 01:30:29.289]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[01:30:29.769 --> 01:30:34.512]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[01:30:34.892 --> 01:30:39.694]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[01:30:40.134 --> 01:30:41.435]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[01:30:41.495 --> 01:30:41.915]  Central.
[01:30:42.496 --> 01:30:49.919]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetsmen.org.
[01:30:52.512 --> 01:30:57.455]  Hello, I'm Dr. Bill Diegels, a nuclear medical reporter here on Genesis After Alex Jones, 2 to 4, Monday to Friday.
[01:30:57.475 --> 01:31:06.039]  I developed the first line of defense kit to block pathogenic infective organisms to give you day-to-day protection as well as infection protection against biological and chemical weapons.
[01:31:06.159 --> 01:31:07.500]  Defense tabs block virus
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:08.001]  We're good to go.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:30.265]  Defense wipes will kill all the pathogenic viruses and bacteria on contact and are safe for you and your loved ones.
[01:31:30.365 --> 01:31:37.911]  So get a first-line defense kit and protect yourself from daily pathogens and from civil defense from biological, chemical, and toxic weapons.
[01:31:38.071 --> 01:31:44.437]  Call us at 888-212-8871 or order securely at NutriMedical.com.
[01:31:44.457 --> 01:31:47.099]  That's N-U-T-R-I-Medical.com or call us at 888-212-8871.
[01:31:47.139 --> 01:31:48.680]  Stay well and protect your loved ones today!
[01:31:58.646 --> 01:32:04.107]  Why should I even get into this new London bombing hoax?
[01:32:04.127 --> 01:32:05.567]  We all know what it is.
[01:32:05.647 --> 01:32:07.788]  I mean, what's the point?
[01:32:27.598 --> 01:32:40.939]  Look at the hate we're breeding Look at the fear we're feeding Look at the lives we're leading The way we've always done before
[01:33:12.458 --> 01:33:19.683]  The people of America have had it so good so long they have no idea how bad tearing is and how it's always right outside the door.
[01:33:20.224 --> 01:33:22.205]  Trying to kick its way in.
[01:33:22.245 --> 01:33:23.326]  Trying to smile.
[01:33:23.346 --> 01:33:24.507]  Trying to soothe you.
[01:33:25.207 --> 01:33:26.088]  Tickling your ear.
[01:33:26.108 --> 01:33:28.389]  Putting it all just right until you let it in.
[01:33:28.409 --> 01:33:31.652]  Then it convinces you to sit down and relax.
[01:33:31.672 --> 01:33:32.632]  Go to sleep.
[01:33:33.613 --> 01:33:35.114]  You wake up, you're in chains.
[01:33:35.755 --> 01:33:38.717]  And the mask is off and there's a demon right there in front of you.
[01:33:39.497 --> 01:33:41.899]  Laughing as the maw of its mouth opens up.
[01:33:42.668 --> 01:33:44.514]  Takes a big chunk right out of your throat.
[01:33:46.937 --> 01:33:52.180]  Because it laughs, gurgling with your blood coursing down its bloody, murderous throat.
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:53.081]  Crank it up!
[01:33:53.521 --> 01:33:59.644]  Peace could last forever, and in my first memories they shot Kennedy.
[01:34:00.245 --> 01:34:06.088]  I went numb when I learned to see, so I never fell for Vietnam.
[01:34:06.148 --> 01:34:14.052]  We cut through all of the sea to remind us all that you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hand.
[01:34:14.132 --> 01:34:15.073]  When everybody
[01:34:20.541 --> 01:34:22.582]  Yeah, that says it all right there.
[01:34:22.622 --> 01:34:32.168]  Did you hear them?
[01:34:32.188 --> 01:34:35.930]  When they shot Kennedy?
[01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:38.271]  I went numb when I learned the scene.
[01:34:40.832 --> 01:34:42.333]  Yeah.
[01:34:42.553 --> 01:34:45.175]  Well, I didn't go numb, but I learned the scene.
[01:34:46.983 --> 01:34:47.663]  You know, it's real simple.
[01:34:47.683 --> 01:34:49.364]  I want people to understand my psychology.
[01:34:49.384 --> 01:34:50.325]  You know where I come from.
[01:34:52.165 --> 01:34:53.626]  I don't even claim to be a good person.
[01:34:54.406 --> 01:34:54.927]  I'm not perfect.
[01:34:55.207 --> 01:34:55.747]  None of us are.
[01:34:57.768 --> 01:35:03.451]  But I remember being like 11 years old when the first time somebody 3 or 4 years older than me started beating me up.
[01:35:05.852 --> 01:35:12.795]  And I just learned that when somebody, you know, gets on top of me and is sitting on my chest, punching me in the face,
[01:35:13.658 --> 01:35:17.279]  That it was instinctively built into me to throw them off of me and start stomping their head in.
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:33.644]  And, uh, frankly, I would, in my life, and I'm not claiming to be some tough guy, it's just, it's just, it's, I'm like a, I guess I'm kind of like that, uh, Jack Russell terrier that took on those pit bulls that were trying to kill those little kids.
[01:35:34.345 --> 01:35:36.025]  I mean, I'm nothing, folks, but I can't help it.
[01:35:36.045 --> 01:35:37.366]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna bite right back.
[01:35:38.266 --> 01:35:39.166]  That's just who I am.
[01:35:40.927 --> 01:35:41.447]  And, uh,
[01:35:42.535 --> 01:35:49.077]  And I learned it felt good when somebody a lot bigger and a lot tougher assaulted me, and then I just started swinging and they went down.
[01:35:51.118 --> 01:35:54.639]  And I am like a sheepdog, with Mark Kornke's analogy, I heard it many years ago.
[01:35:55.219 --> 01:36:00.740]  The general public are sheep, the rural order are wolves, and we've got to be the sheepdogs, folks.
[01:36:02.521 --> 01:36:07.702]  And a sheepdog instinctively is bred to not like wolves and want to attack wolves.
[01:36:09.623 --> 01:36:09.763]  And
[01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:14.173]  Human beings, men, are meant to be sheepdogs over the women and children.
[01:36:15.954 --> 01:36:20.497]  We're meant to know the scene, know how things work, be involved, and stand up for our people's freedom.
[01:36:21.858 --> 01:36:31.685]  All the instincts that you feel when you feel aggressive, or powerful, or vitriolic when you watch sports, or when you watch boxing, those are all instincts for defending your family.
[01:36:31.985 --> 01:36:36.148]  That's why you feel such excitement, because that's a core drive in your psyche.
[01:36:37.603 --> 01:36:40.665]  Well, I mean, I'm just somebody who found out what my core drive was really meant for.
[01:36:42.246 --> 01:36:45.629]  When I found out there was a global elite trying to destroy my country, I got involved.
[01:36:45.649 --> 01:36:46.649]  Then I learned more and more.
[01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:51.353]  And now I've learned that they actually like killing people and they're psychopaths, and I'm freaked out, okay?
[01:36:53.394 --> 01:37:02.340]  I'm real freaked out that the cops are too stupid to know what they're part of, that the public's too dumb, and I do have a guardian spirit.
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:05.663]  I mean, I really think that's the description of what I am, who I am.
[01:37:05.743 --> 01:37:06.083]  I have a
[01:37:07.282 --> 01:37:08.243]  Guardian spirit.
[01:37:09.503 --> 01:37:10.964]  I don't want to control people's lives.
[01:37:11.124 --> 01:37:13.646]  I don't want to be... I like seeing people do well.
[01:37:14.326 --> 01:37:16.147]  I always thought that's how everybody else thought.
[01:37:16.567 --> 01:37:24.291]  I didn't know that, frankly, the governing spirit of the world is greed and envy and avarice and people trying to pull you down because they instinctively think that puts them up.
[01:37:24.511 --> 01:37:26.472]  When they don't know, that just brings them down even lower.
[01:37:27.833 --> 01:37:31.015]  I'm always shocked by the scum in this movement.
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:35.380]  The scum's everywhere.
[01:37:35.661 --> 01:37:37.722]  We are a fallen race, a fallen species.
[01:37:37.962 --> 01:37:38.822]  We are sinners, folks.
[01:37:38.882 --> 01:37:39.242]  It's real.
[01:37:39.482 --> 01:37:40.263]  We got problems.
[01:37:42.024 --> 01:37:43.524]  The humans tell you we don't have shin.
[01:37:43.704 --> 01:37:44.925]  200 million killed last century.
[01:37:45.185 --> 01:37:45.945]  What do you call that?
[01:37:45.965 --> 01:37:51.108]  I mean, what do you call DynCorp kidnapping little kids?
[01:37:53.309 --> 01:37:54.049]  That isn't evil!
[01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:57.891]  Beam me up, Scotty, because I can't handle it anymore, folks.
[01:38:04.366 --> 01:38:10.512]  And the real evil is the spirit of denial by the yuppies and the trendies and just all the rest of you.
[01:38:10.913 --> 01:38:22.925]  As long as you've got your little sub-niche costume and your little niche of friends and you all feel self-important and you're all off delusional, you think everything's honky-dory.
[01:38:23.065 --> 01:38:24.166]  It is not!
[01:38:29.915 --> 01:38:31.496]  You know, I wasn't going to talk about this today.
[01:38:31.536 --> 01:38:33.977]  Last time I thought about it, I thought people won't even believe this.
[01:38:34.457 --> 01:38:35.157]  It's not true.
[01:38:36.798 --> 01:38:39.799]  I'm driving to the office, about 20 minutes to get to my office from my home.
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:42.180]  Coming back to work the night shift.
[01:38:44.181 --> 01:38:52.945]  And I'm driving down the main street right up by my house and I see this fella with his wife or girlfriend on the back of the motorcycle with him.
[01:38:55.446 --> 01:38:57.127]  And I'm literally sitting there having these thoughts.
[01:38:57.187 --> 01:38:57.507]  I'm going,
[01:38:58.178 --> 01:39:00.240]  Man, motorcycles sure are neat and sharp fun.
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:04.503]  I wish I lived way out in the country because I'd ride a motorcycle to work because that's statistically pretty safe.
[01:39:05.124 --> 01:39:06.825]  Man, look at that happy young couple.
[01:39:06.905 --> 01:39:19.956]  I know they're having fun with the wind in their hair and they're out having a good time and I was, you know, admiring that, you know, that he was handsome and she was beautiful and I just like nice things and I like people having a good time and I thought, gee, I hope they're safe.
[01:39:20.617 --> 01:39:22.919]  At least they're wearing helmets and I just think God, man,
[01:39:24.103 --> 01:39:25.224]  I think about family I've had.
[01:39:25.244 --> 01:39:26.905]  There have been really bad motorcycle accidents.
[01:39:26.925 --> 01:39:28.345]  Motorcycle accidents I've been in.
[01:39:28.385 --> 01:39:32.788]  All of a sudden this car, and we're going like 40 down William Cannon.
[01:39:33.248 --> 01:39:35.309]  This car comes flying up behind him.
[01:39:35.349 --> 01:39:36.730]  I mean one inch almost hitting him.
[01:39:37.110 --> 01:39:38.351]  Gyrates out in the lane.
[01:39:38.431 --> 01:39:39.532]  Flies out in front of me.
[01:39:39.952 --> 01:39:40.612]  Fishtails.
[01:39:40.692 --> 01:39:41.413]  Cuts in front.
[01:39:41.493 --> 01:39:42.613]  Zooms through a red light.
[01:39:43.934 --> 01:39:45.115]  And I saw who was driving.
[01:39:45.155 --> 01:39:45.895]  It was a Mexican.
[01:39:47.717 --> 01:39:48.918]  And I go, man, that was weird.
[01:39:49.138 --> 01:39:51.039]  And the guardian spirit came up in me.
[01:39:51.079 --> 01:39:52.540]  And I know there's good cops that have that.
[01:39:52.821 --> 01:39:55.322]  And I wanted to go pull that guy over and beat the hell out of him.
[01:39:55.342 --> 01:39:56.603]  But I controlled myself.
[01:39:56.663 --> 01:39:57.884]  I thought, you know what?
[01:39:57.924 --> 01:39:59.105]  That's just some crazy person.
[01:39:59.145 --> 01:40:00.386]  Probably just had a fight with his wife.
[01:40:00.946 --> 01:40:01.807]  You know, upset.
[01:40:01.827 --> 01:40:03.588]  I assessed it properly.
[01:40:03.608 --> 01:40:04.089]  He was upset.
[01:40:04.409 --> 01:40:06.010]  Then I turn on William Cannon.
[01:40:06.030 --> 01:40:09.432]  I'm on the Mopac side ramp.
[01:40:10.393 --> 01:40:13.895]  Somebody in a truck's violently driving and worming and driving all crazy.
[01:40:13.936 --> 01:40:14.476]  Some Mexican.
[01:40:16.579 --> 01:40:17.900]  I'm going, something's going on here.
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:19.021]  My brain starts moving.
[01:40:19.061 --> 01:40:33.153]  Then I'm getting on the 290 exit ramp, getting up on 290, Ben White, and another car comes flying right up behind cars, driving violently, swerving, getting right on people's cars, and I go, is that a Mexican?
[01:40:33.413 --> 01:40:37.536]  And I accelerate, and I shoot up beside him, and he's looking at me with hatred.
[01:40:37.776 --> 01:40:38.537]  It's a Mexican!
[01:40:40.163 --> 01:40:47.185]  Then I exit Lamar, and I go down off Ben White down Lamar, and I'm on Lamar, and there's another car driving violently, and it's a Mexican.
[01:40:47.685 --> 01:40:58.008]  Folks, the illegal alien crowd was throwing fits in the streets, violently engaging in racial harassment of white drivers yesterday, and I saw it.
[01:40:59.468 --> 01:41:06.770]  Man, we are, the country's gone, and I, political correctness says I'm not supposed to come on air and talk about this.
[01:41:08.110 --> 01:41:11.092]  Did you see that around the country yesterday?
[01:41:15.755 --> 01:41:21.659]  And is there some type of subconscious psychic transmission that was causing the illegals to do that?
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:29.905]  Or did the Mexican radio station in Austin, did somebody speak Spanish who was listening to it, was it an announcement or something to drive crazy?
[01:41:33.095 --> 01:41:44.605]  I mean, I probably drove 5 miles, 6 miles to my office, this is about a 15 minute trip, and I saw 4, let me see, 1, 2, 3, 4 people driving like complete maniacs.
[01:41:45.286 --> 01:41:48.789]  I mean, they all, each person almost killed these people on a motorcycle.
[01:41:53.933 --> 01:41:56.035]  I mean, driving like, psychopathically.
[01:42:02.085 --> 01:42:05.368]  Now it's hard for me to come on air and even talk about that because I know our tribalism.
[01:42:05.688 --> 01:42:11.653]  Because I go to my rallies and the events and all my good Hispanic friends are there and Hispanic families and great American people.
[01:42:13.614 --> 01:42:16.717]  And again, more predominantly of the Congressional Medal of Honor winners are Hispanic.
[01:42:17.623 --> 01:42:20.625]  And over a third of those that founded Texas were Hispanics.
[01:42:20.765 --> 01:42:33.755]  But the media has taken that birthright from you and tried to say you're not part of Texas, you're not part of America, you're not part of the Alamo, you're not Juan Navarro, you're not part of any of this, San Jacinto, you didn't write the Constitution, the Bill of Rights of Texas.
[01:42:35.396 --> 01:42:36.757]  You have no part of this country.
[01:42:38.298 --> 01:42:38.998]  They tell you that.
[01:42:40.219 --> 01:42:45.483]  And I guess the people violently driving around yesterday had that, and they took it as some type of affront.
[01:42:46.973 --> 01:42:49.175]  And listen, maybe they lived here ten years.
[01:42:49.956 --> 01:42:55.660]  Maybe their granddaddy came over here and somebody called him a name or was mean to him.
[01:42:56.141 --> 01:43:03.346]  And so now you're driving around in the 21st century with all these yuppies who feel sorry for themselves and think they're bad and are all guilty.
[01:43:04.387 --> 01:43:06.589]  And it's two worlds colliding, folks.
[01:43:10.632 --> 01:43:13.194]  But I mean, I saw that, and I know good and well what I saw.
[01:43:14.035 --> 01:43:15.216]  And frankly, it was scary.
[01:43:19.833 --> 01:43:35.038]  Because it's tribal, and I tell the people that were tribally angry yesterday and throwing fits on the roads of Austin, and all over the country I would guess, the elite plan is to overrun the country and drive down the wages and have this whole fight with each other.
[01:43:35.578 --> 01:43:43.120]  I'm not saying that you've been here ten years and yeah this was Mexico and sure you've got some type of birth right here and blah blah blah.
[01:43:44.469 --> 01:43:46.230]  But you understand the bigger picture?
[01:43:46.270 --> 01:43:52.155]  The New World Order is using you to bring down this country, and see how much you are angry at the country?
[01:43:52.655 --> 01:44:03.783]  That you expect the Congress to give you a tax amnesty for five years, and to give amnesty to aggravated felons, and all this stuff?
[01:44:04.404 --> 01:44:11.169]  It's all the big companies wanting cheap labor, and wanting to destroy the middle class, and wanting to bankrupt this country, and bankrupt the states!
[01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:13.831]  I'm not your enemy!
[01:44:15.962 --> 01:44:17.264]  I want you to have a good life.
[01:44:17.324 --> 01:44:18.246]  I want you to do good.
[01:44:18.326 --> 01:44:23.514]  But they've taught us all this tribal bull of where somebody's got to fall for somebody to rise.
[01:44:23.694 --> 01:44:24.595]  It isn't how it works.
[01:44:27.379 --> 01:44:29.883]  And the argument will be, well wait, I thought you just said they're here to drive down the wages.
[01:44:30.023 --> 01:44:31.586]  In the big economic picture,
[01:44:33.308 --> 01:44:35.789]  This will be detrimental to the middle class of the United States.
[01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:44.755]  Now, I've said if the illegal aliens coming in were pro-gun, pro-USA, anti-new world order, even though it would hurt the economy in the midterm, I would probably still support it.
[01:44:45.655 --> 01:44:46.055]  Anybody.
[01:44:46.095 --> 01:44:47.616]  I'll take anybody to fight the new world order.
[01:44:47.636 --> 01:44:48.577]  That's the whole name of the game.
[01:44:49.097 --> 01:44:49.837]  But they're not.
[01:44:50.238 --> 01:44:52.579]  You have to play chess here and see the grand picture.
[01:44:53.099 --> 01:44:55.240]  They're going to vote for gun control and everything else, folks.
[01:44:55.521 --> 01:44:57.342]  And they probably will get the Rammstein in the future.
[01:44:57.662 --> 01:44:59.783]  That's the crisis we've entered into here.
[01:45:03.067 --> 01:45:07.531]  And it doesn't matter if you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or, you know, polka-dotted.
[01:45:08.753 --> 01:45:11.956]  Your children are breathing the drug-resistant immune TB.
[01:45:12.076 --> 01:45:13.457]  It is spreading all over the country.
[01:45:13.497 --> 01:45:15.579]  They've shut up sanitariums coast-to-coast quietly.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:20.163]  The average person with TB will give it to 40 people in one year.
[01:45:20.303 --> 01:45:21.104]  That's a federal number.
[01:45:21.965 --> 01:45:23.987]  I don't know how accurate it is, but I know it's a lot of people get it.
[01:45:27.233 --> 01:45:33.138]  I don't care if your kid is white and from Russia, or your child's from Poland, or your child's from Germany, or your child's from Mexico.
[01:45:33.158 --> 01:45:34.819]  We always talk about Mexicos, that's the majority.
[01:45:35.159 --> 01:45:37.881]  And it's a country we've had a couple wars with who doesn't like this country.
[01:45:38.862 --> 01:45:40.463]  And they haven't given up their nationalism.
[01:45:40.843 --> 01:45:44.246]  Americans have been taught to give up our nationalism, but the Mexicans have been taught to have theirs.
[01:45:44.806 --> 01:45:46.087]  And they're here with leprosy.
[01:45:46.107 --> 01:45:47.328]  7,000 cases.
[01:45:49.548 --> 01:45:54.390]  Last time I saw the numbers, from three cases in all the decades before to 7,000 in one year in 2005.
[01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:57.812]  They've got a leper colony outside of Palestine, Texas.
[01:45:59.793 --> 01:46:00.613]  A leper colony!
[01:46:02.214 --> 01:46:03.895]  And they don't even check these people for diseases.
[01:46:04.355 --> 01:46:09.398]  They did a hundred years ago if you came in here from Ireland or Italy or Eastern Europe or Japan.
[01:46:11.759 --> 01:46:14.160]  They don't now, because the government doesn't care about us.
[01:46:16.167 --> 01:46:20.169]  Now, you're a Mexican-American, and you're like, well, don't call me Mexican-American, I'm an American.
[01:46:20.189 --> 01:46:25.331]  Yeah, I mean, don't call me a German-American, or a French-American, or an Alsatian-American, or a British-American.
[01:46:25.651 --> 01:46:26.411]  I'm an American, too.
[01:46:26.451 --> 01:46:29.952]  I don't walk around talking about, you know, what Heinz 57 I am.
[01:46:33.434 --> 01:46:38.315]  If you're in this country, and you live here, I mean, do you want your children breathing all this?
[01:46:38.355 --> 01:46:39.776]  I mean, this is really going on!
[01:46:41.317 --> 01:46:42.417]  This is really happening!
[01:46:48.317 --> 01:46:52.418]  This society is in deep, deep, deep crisis.
[01:46:52.538 --> 01:46:55.940]  I'll get into the bombing, but let me cover the economy first.
[01:46:56.780 --> 01:46:57.320]  Listen to this.
[01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:00.581]  And I literally have like 15, 20, I don't even count.
[01:47:00.821 --> 01:47:02.782]  I've got a stack of business news here.
[01:47:03.742 --> 01:47:12.085]  On the M3 money supply, the whole ratios of inflation, truly it's over 13% per annum.
[01:47:13.505 --> 01:47:14.826]  I mean, stuff that will curl your hair.
[01:47:17.131 --> 01:47:20.995]  Banks calling in loans when they're 90% paid, when people aren't even in default?
[01:47:22.376 --> 01:47:26.040]  I bet a lot of you didn't read those 500 pages you signed when you got that house loan, did you?
[01:47:28.021 --> 01:47:29.383]  I'm not just talking about arms.
[01:47:29.483 --> 01:47:32.506]  They're calling in stuff that aren't even adjustable rate mortgages.
[01:47:35.128 --> 01:47:38.832]  VIS warns of Great Depression dangers from credit spree.
[01:47:38.892 --> 01:47:42.275]  Now you've got to love the people that designed this and set all this up.
[01:47:42.964 --> 01:47:44.846]  And always you consolidate during these periods.
[01:47:44.866 --> 01:47:46.228]  See they quote issue the money.
[01:47:46.568 --> 01:47:48.870]  They get their assets when they implode economies.
[01:47:51.353 --> 01:47:53.275]  That's the big dirty secret about banking.
[01:47:53.836 --> 01:47:55.437]  That's 101 banking by the way.
[01:47:56.158 --> 01:47:57.960]  But the general dumb public doesn't know that.
[01:47:59.736 --> 01:48:12.964]  The Bank of International Settlements, the world's most prestigious financial body, has warned that years of loose monetary policy has fueled a dangerous credit bubble, leaving the global economy more vulnerable to another 1930s-style slump than generally understood.
[01:48:13.004 --> 01:48:16.447]  1930s-style slump, if you call it that.
[01:48:17.147 --> 01:48:23.511]  Virtually nobody foresaw the Great Depression of the 1930s or the crisis which affected Japan and Southeast Asia in the early 1990s.
[01:48:23.711 --> 01:48:25.472]  There's still a depression in Japan.
[01:48:25.933 --> 01:48:27.834]  In recent times, in fact,
[01:48:28.864 --> 01:48:39.810]  Each downturn was preceded by a period of non-inflationary growth exuberant enough to lead many commentators to suggest that a new era had arrived, said the bank.
[01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:47.494]  Only a new era of people not recognizing inflation and having unreasonable exuberance.
[01:48:48.655 --> 01:48:57.860]  The BIS, the ultimate bank of central bankers, pointed to the confluence of worrying signs citing mass insurance, issuance of new
[01:48:58.897 --> 01:49:12.724]  Tangled credit investments and instruments, soaring levels of household debt, extreme appetite for risk shown by investors, and enriched imbalances in the world currency system.
[01:49:16.066 --> 01:49:19.028]  Entrenched imbalances in the world currency system.
[01:49:19.648 --> 01:49:26.492]  Behind each set of concerns lurks a common factor of highly accommodating financial conditions
[01:49:28.516 --> 01:49:35.242]  Tail events affecting the global economy might at some point have much higher cost than is commonly supposed it said.
[01:49:35.262 --> 01:49:44.069]  The BIS said China may have repeated the disastrous errors made by Japan in the 80s when Tokyo let rip with excess liquidity.
[01:49:44.449 --> 01:49:48.212]  When it gets into the US, it just gets worse from there.
[01:49:48.232 --> 01:49:48.833]  Hold it right back.
[01:49:56.465 --> 01:50:01.929]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.289 --> 01:50:09.934]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.618 --> 01:50:17.662]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.082 --> 01:50:29.528]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.808 --> 01:50:33.370]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.770 --> 01:50:35.711]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.031 --> 01:50:39.893]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.027 --> 01:50:58.112]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[01:51:53.027 --> 01:51:54.728]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:54.949 --> 01:51:58.671]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:58.992 --> 01:52:01.193]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.

[01:52:08.078 --> 01:52:12.982]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.182 --> 01:52:22.129]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[01:52:57.165 --> 01:53:16.600]  I've watched all these minority leaders every time I turn on PBS telling black folks, Hispanics, everybody, get out, get the American Dream, buy yourself a home!
[01:53:19.422 --> 01:53:25.187]  But all they do is give them adjustable interest rate mortgages
[01:53:28.191 --> 01:53:37.976]  Or adjustable rate mortgages, which you don't even own, and they can jack up the interest rate, but now they're calling in the loans, and I thought we'd go over that.
[01:53:37.996 --> 01:53:40.097]  This is out of the London Telegraph.
[01:53:40.357 --> 01:53:42.338]  Banks set to call in a swath of loans.
[01:53:42.538 --> 01:53:48.321]  And by the way, this is a Catch-22 for me, like everything is, but I'm doing the right moral thing.
[01:53:48.621 --> 01:53:50.322]  I don't even want this fiat thing to implode.
[01:53:50.882 --> 01:53:52.103]  We're all tied into it, folks.
[01:53:52.543 --> 01:53:53.924]  I could play along with a lie,
[01:53:54.645 --> 01:53:59.907]  Which the mainstream media has been doing up until about now, which shows the elite wants things to implode now, or very soon.
[01:54:00.827 --> 01:54:03.388]  Or I could warn you about what's going on, which is what we do.
[01:54:03.989 --> 01:54:06.650]  Of course, you can just deny that mortgages and banks exist.
[01:54:06.670 --> 01:54:09.911]  Kind of like they deny there's a move to ban free speech on talk radio.
[01:54:09.931 --> 01:54:12.672]  I mean, it's just off the charts.
[01:54:12.772 --> 01:54:13.893]  Everything is off the charts.
[01:54:14.473 --> 01:54:17.374]  I'm going to plug a couple sponsors right now that are fantastic folks.
[01:54:19.978 --> 01:54:21.759]  My friends, listen to me very, very carefully.
[01:54:21.839 --> 01:54:25.900]  We have to store food for our families if we're going to stay free and stay alive.
[01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:29.401]  The prime rule of power is that you control nations with oil and people with food.
[01:54:29.962 --> 01:54:40.365]  If countries with ethnic cleansing may euthanize the elders and kill the young, preferably before they're born, and starve everyone else in between, bullets and the manpower to pull the triggers are too expensive and time-consuming.
[01:54:40.766 --> 01:54:46.147]  Starvation, economic depravication, have always been the preferred method of eliminating undesirables.
[01:54:46.948 --> 01:54:47.308]  I would,
[01:54:48.979 --> 01:54:58.769]  Warn all of you to get prepared and get some storable food so you don't have to stand in a bread line to give up whatever money, whatever wealth, whatever guns you've got left.
[01:54:59.890 --> 01:55:03.574]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:55:04.195 --> 01:55:05.876]  Do what it takes to store food now.
[01:55:05.896 --> 01:55:05.976]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:55:05.996 --> 01:55:06.056]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:55:13.055 --> 01:55:26.001]  You know, the government, what tells me they're getting ready to really pull something is all these billboards saying, have a week of food, have a month of food and water, so they can go, we told you, we, we, oh, but you need two years of it, oh, oh, we're the government, we love you.
[01:55:26.021 --> 01:55:30.503]  1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[01:55:30.523 --> 01:55:32.604]  And then we got another fine sponsor, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:55:41.392 --> 01:55:46.835]  And that is, of course, Solutions from Science in Thomas, Illinois.
[01:55:47.656 --> 01:55:56.721]  They've got an offer at blacklistedherbs.com on one of their best-selling products, Shilocene from Shiloket, from the mountains in Nepal, there in Tibet and surrounding areas.
[01:55:58.182 --> 01:56:05.586]  It is a residue that builds up in the high mountains, 84 different types of minerals in ionic form.
[01:56:06.066 --> 01:56:09.248]  Solutions from Science in Thomas, Illinois has made this offer very easy.
[01:56:10.057 --> 01:56:20.266]  You just order at their website, or on the phone, or via the mail, and they just send you an invoice, no credit card, no nothing, and in three months when your supply is gone, if you want more, you pay for the first supply and get your second supply.
[01:56:20.806 --> 01:56:22.948]  It's just, hey, if you like it, pay us for it.
[01:56:24.129 --> 01:56:25.050]  Boy, that's a good deal.
[01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:26.351]  877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, or blacklistofherbs.com.
[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:50.291]  And I do, in closing for this hour, hope you go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a 15 cent a day membership there because we need to continue our fight against the New World Order and it's a great activist tool, very informative.
[01:56:50.671 --> 01:56:52.433]  TV shows, all the films, it's all there.
[01:56:52.533 --> 01:57:00.739]  My book, Paul Austin's book, a bunch of other films, great deal, thousands of pieces of media, $5.95 a month, get a yearly membership and get three months free or just get a trial monthly.
[01:57:01.139 --> 01:57:03.361]  PrisonPlanet.tv and we need your support.
[01:57:04.236 --> 01:57:06.377]  To continue what we're doing and to expand our operations.
[01:57:06.397 --> 01:57:10.620]  When we get back I'm going to finish up with Bank of International Settlements warns of Great Depression.
[01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:12.041]  Globally.
[01:57:12.861 --> 01:57:14.842]  Banks set to call in swath of loans.
[01:57:14.902 --> 01:57:16.103]  I talked to most adults.
[01:57:17.144 --> 01:57:19.165]  And they don't even know that banks call in loans.
[01:57:19.185 --> 01:57:20.065]  You know when they call them in?
[01:57:22.647 --> 01:57:31.632]  When your notes half paid or 90% paid and they've done a... they do analysis of your financial worth and they do it when you can't pay.
[01:57:33.852 --> 01:57:38.163]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.189 --> 01:57:50.850]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.491 --> 01:57:52.573]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.274 --> 01:57:54.376]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.037 --> 01:57:55.838]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.599 --> 01:57:57.541]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.182 --> 01:58:02.088]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.369 --> 01:58:04.712]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:58:05.593 --> 01:58:06.473]  Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.834 --> 01:58:25.340]  So the International Bank of Settlements, the global clearinghouse and consortium governing the private global crime cartel, when I say that I mean global crime cartel, the global mafia that owns the private banks that issue the money that control almost every government on earth, they're saying get ready for global depression.
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:29.021]  They say it's going to come, they don't know when it's going to come.
[01:58:30.211 --> 01:58:32.353]  Here's another one of the London Telegraph today.
[01:58:32.913 --> 01:58:35.075]  Banks set to call in a swath of loans.
[01:58:35.616 --> 01:58:45.224]  The United States faces a severe credit crunch as mounting losses on risky forms of debt catch up with the banks and force them to curb lending and call in existing loans.
[01:58:45.324 --> 01:58:51.970]  Yeah, when a $300,000 house in Austin is almost a million dollars today, folks, the inflation is just off the charts.
[01:58:53.214 --> 01:58:55.395]  The United States faces a severe credit crunch.
[01:58:55.415 --> 01:58:56.956]  You see, they're already starting to cut back on credit.
[01:58:57.396 --> 01:59:03.680]  It's mounting losses on risky forms of debt, catch up with banks, and force them to curb lending and call in existing loans.
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:09.663]  Now, they don't call in a loan when you've got 10% of it paid, unless you're in default for even a year.
[01:59:11.264 --> 01:59:12.004]  They don't want that.
[01:59:13.625 --> 01:59:21.009]  But what they like is when you're half paid, even a third paid, or 90% paid, and they do an analysis of what, say, some 80-year-old woman's got.
[01:59:21.698 --> 01:59:24.020]  Let me see, she's been paying 25 years on this house.
[01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:31.206]  She owes $20,000 more, and our data shows she's only got about $5,000 in liquid cash.
[01:59:32.106 --> 01:59:34.688]  She's living on Social Security, she's got insurance.
[01:59:36.290 --> 01:59:36.610]  Take it!
[01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:38.411]  And boom, she gets foreclosed.
[01:59:38.512 --> 01:59:41.734]  And they will send the constables, they will drag her out by her hair.
[01:59:42.234 --> 01:59:42.895]  With pleasure.
[01:59:43.816 --> 01:59:45.137]  And they do have pleasure, by the way.
[01:59:45.597 --> 01:59:46.938]  I've gone and videotaped that.
[01:59:46.958 --> 01:59:50.261]  I'll never forget Nelda Wells Spears, the tax assessor in Travis County at the time.
[01:59:51.235 --> 02:00:00.839]  And we had the, on local channel 17, they were showing for days, there were so many, hundreds of them, hundreds back in the late 90's, of houses they'd taken for not paying taxes or not being able to.
[02:00:00.859 --> 02:00:05.882]  And we walked, we taped that off TV and we walked up to her and we said, uh, you're taking people's houses.
[02:00:05.902 --> 02:00:08.163]  She goes, that's, we don't take houses, we never take houses.
[02:00:09.103 --> 02:00:09.884]  We don't take one house.
[02:00:09.944 --> 02:00:12.465]  And we showed her at the courthouse steps, selling them.
[02:00:12.965 --> 02:00:14.746]  And we showed the video of them advertising them.
[02:00:15.286 --> 02:00:16.347]  But again, they just lie.
[02:00:16.687 --> 02:00:19.248]  There's no amnesty, there's no taking houses, there's no
[02:00:21.078 --> 02:00:35.024]  You know, it's just a... And I want all the New York cops to go around threatening to say people have bombs on them, they got video cameras, or saying there's no free speech, and arresting everybody, and help go take old ladies' houses and apartments.
[02:00:36.885 --> 02:00:38.366]  You're not going to have anything either.
[02:00:38.406 --> 02:00:39.906]  It's going to be so bad.
[02:00:40.727 --> 02:00:42.388]  But you're going to have nothing either.
[02:00:42.468 --> 02:00:45.269]  And I hope you enjoy it, because you deserve it.
[02:00:46.664 --> 02:00:53.289]  A lot of us are going to be hurting this and it's going to be tough on everybody, but at least all the scum is going to be hurt too.
[02:00:54.669 --> 02:00:59.973]  And again, I don't like to admit that I actually take some pleasure in that, but I like seeing justice being done.
[02:00:59.993 --> 02:01:02.955]  Now the bankers are going to do just fine.
[02:01:02.995 --> 02:01:10.320]  The really evil people, as usual, will just consolidate everything and then they'll create a new credit boom and sell it all back to you and then steal it up again.
[02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:13.282]  They'll do it over and over again.
[02:01:16.051 --> 02:01:20.972]  I mean, I hope they can contain it and it's just like a dot-com bust or something, but they're saying that's not what's going to happen.
[02:01:25.713 --> 02:01:29.274]  I mean, Merrill Lynch is even having problems right now, Chase Manhattan, Citibank.
[02:01:31.575 --> 02:01:40.357]  The Financial Times of London said last year that things are in such a crisis, even central banks could have problems.
[02:01:41.457 --> 02:01:44.538]  Now, they issue the money out of nothing, but still, the numbers are so huge,
[02:01:45.513 --> 02:01:48.554]  And it affects so many of their other assets that it even endangers them.
[02:01:49.134 --> 02:01:53.915]  That's how powerful this is.
[02:01:56.456 --> 02:02:11.700]  Now, if we were able to expose that it's the global elite behind all this, and that they set up this atmosphere, and that they consolidate during these credit restriction periods, the short calls, the rest of it,
[02:02:13.502 --> 02:02:20.128]  Then the elite would not implode the bubble, but our irrational exuberance in a way is actually defeating them.
[02:02:20.168 --> 02:02:29.918]  They use it to get us overextended, but now they can get up and say, depression, depression, depression, real estate, pop the bubble, pop the bubble, and it doesn't even entirely work.
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:34.222]  That's for propaganda working against them.
[02:02:36.904 --> 02:02:38.566]  If we can expose that they're behind it,
[02:02:39.472 --> 02:02:44.313]  They will just allow indefinite bubble expansion and in a fiat economy that will indeed work.
[02:02:46.394 --> 02:02:54.296]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.676 --> 02:03:02.318]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:03.010 --> 02:03:10.056]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.456 --> 02:03:21.865]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.206 --> 02:03:25.708]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:28.130]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.431 --> 02:03:32.274]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.365 --> 02:03:50.448]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:50.508 --> 02:03:57.833]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:03:57.973 --> 02:04:06.578]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazines,
[02:04:06.818 --> 02:04:08.099]  I don't know.

[02:04:45.285 --> 02:04:48.207]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:04:48.387 --> 02:04:53.570]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:59.213]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:04:59.613 --> 02:05:00.694]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:01.074 --> 02:05:09.942]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:05:10.422 --> 02:05:12.023]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[02:05:46.368 --> 02:05:51.851]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:11.435 --> 02:06:18.537]  The New World Order will only implode the economy and go into mass depression and police state if they think you'll buy into it.
[02:06:20.211 --> 02:06:28.255]  That's why they wanted to get their amnesty done now, because they know if the Depression hits, there'll be even more pressure to kick the illegals out, and they've got to have their amnesty first.
[02:06:28.856 --> 02:06:34.779]  They've got to have their amnesty first before they give them the order to torch every major city, if that is the New World Order's wish.
[02:06:35.019 --> 02:06:37.961]  They've got a lot of different ways to kill us.
[02:06:38.001 --> 02:06:44.364]  It's kind of like they got us out on the chopping block for the public execution, and they might do it with a hatchet, an axe, a dagger, a noose.
[02:06:46.397 --> 02:06:50.638]  They should have that as a public spectacle, and no one knows which tool they're going to use.
[02:06:51.019 --> 02:06:52.499]  Will it be the nuclear terror attacks?
[02:06:52.539 --> 02:06:53.720]  Will it be the bio-attacks?
[02:06:54.100 --> 02:06:59.261]  Will it be the illegal alien riot that I witnessed yesterday on the highway?
[02:06:59.281 --> 02:07:00.802]  I mean, what will it be?
[02:07:00.822 --> 02:07:02.723]  I don't know.
[02:07:04.803 --> 02:07:06.644]  If we expose them, they won't be able to do it.
[02:07:07.104 --> 02:07:12.386]  That's why they've gone from 300,000 police in 1993 to over a million.
[02:07:12.966 --> 02:07:14.727]  That's why they're hiring even more now.
[02:07:14.747 --> 02:07:15.807]  They're talking about doubling that.
[02:07:16.420 --> 02:07:25.563]  That's why they're putting in all the cameras, because they know they need to be able to pull the rug out, really get hardcore with us, and that there's going to be riots, there's going to be massive increases in crime.
[02:07:25.583 --> 02:07:29.345]  Folks, you know I've been right about everything else in the past.
[02:07:29.485 --> 02:07:31.066]  I don't want to be right about this, believe me.
[02:07:31.126 --> 02:07:42.710]  We can stop it if we call the White House and say, we know you're behind the New World Order, we know you're behind the economy, if you call the Federal Reserve, if you call the talk radio and talk about real issues instead of Paris Hilton and
[02:07:44.932 --> 02:07:46.012]  It's just all the rest of it.
[02:07:46.053 --> 02:07:46.953]  It's so sick.
[02:07:48.293 --> 02:07:56.357]  It's all just... It's just... I just can't believe how evil... I'm gonna take calls and we'll get into more on the bombing news and a bunch of other... I got a bunch of news here.
[02:07:56.377 --> 02:07:59.238]  And I'm sorry if I sound bummed out today.
[02:07:59.278 --> 02:08:02.640]  It's just I didn't get enough sleep last night and the news gets me really mad.
[02:08:02.660 --> 02:08:04.060]  The two is not a good combination.
[02:08:06.401 --> 02:08:07.582]  I just want to live my life too.
[02:08:07.622 --> 02:08:08.903]  You know, I want to go on vacation.
[02:08:08.923 --> 02:08:09.923]  I want to have a nice house.
[02:08:10.403 --> 02:08:11.404]  I want to have a future.
[02:08:13.865 --> 02:08:14.365]  I'm mad!
[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:20.162]  And I'm mad that the police and the military and a lot of the people don't know whose side they're on.
[02:08:21.643 --> 02:08:23.324]  And they're going along with their own destruction.
[02:08:25.426 --> 02:08:26.586]  But I guess I should be happy.
[02:08:26.626 --> 02:08:28.708]  I mean, I keep saying they're not awake.
[02:08:28.728 --> 02:08:32.690]  14% approve of Congress and Gallup poll, which shows it's probably even worse than that.
[02:08:32.710 --> 02:08:40.495]  80 plus percent of the troops now are against the war and polls they've given them with their commanders sitting there watching how they answer, they're still saying, I'm against it.
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:44.962]  And so really, I guess the people are awake!
[02:08:44.982 --> 02:09:12.024]  91% didn't want this amnesty, and we were able to batter them into submission, but the illegals are still legal by fiat, but at least when the depression comes, you know, the depression may actually save this country in a sick way, because it'll probably flush a lot of the illegals out of the country, because stuff will get so bad here, it'll really show people the pressure they've caused, and the police state's going to get five times worse, and it'll probably just end up in us winning.
[02:09:14.295 --> 02:09:16.777]  Stuff may just, I don't know, God works in mysterious ways.
[02:09:16.797 --> 02:09:23.822]  I just, there's so many angles to this, and I got a pretty good brain at computing and all, and it just, just buckle up, folks.
[02:09:23.862 --> 02:09:24.863]  That's all I can tell you.
[02:09:24.903 --> 02:09:25.443]  Buckle up.
[02:09:29.906 --> 02:09:31.347]  Let me tell you how it's going to work, folks.
[02:09:33.029 --> 02:09:35.951]  There's already racial conflict between blacks and Hispanics from L.A.
[02:09:35.971 --> 02:09:38.553]  to Austin, Texas to New York, killing each other every day.
[02:09:39.113 --> 02:09:43.136]  Just like they had a Mexican accidentally bump a black child at the
[02:09:45.859 --> 02:09:54.482]  Juneteenth parade last week, and the black folks beat the man to death, and half beat the other poor fellow to death.
[02:09:55.862 --> 02:09:57.523]  Well, the same thing is going to go for the cops.
[02:09:57.583 --> 02:10:03.365]  You're going to go ahead, you're going to shoot somebody, you're going to beat somebody up, and the rioting is going to start, and it's not going to stop.
[02:10:03.865 --> 02:10:10.727]  And by the way, I don't want that to happen, because the government then is going to bring in a depression, and say it was caused by that.
[02:10:12.737 --> 02:10:15.878]  That's why they may stage a terror attack, but watch the economy start dropping.
[02:10:16.298 --> 02:10:27.240]  Let me tell you, the biggest time for a terror attack right now is if you see the stock market drop like 3,000 points, 4,000 points in a week, there'll probably be a terror attack that next week, just like on 9-11.
[02:10:27.861 --> 02:10:31.541]  Then they go, oh, the economy's had the big bust because of 9-11.
[02:10:39.699 --> 02:10:57.288]  My point is, men out there better spend a little less time watching baseball, and a little less time picking their noses, and a little less time acting tough at the gym, and a little less time swaggering around getting new tattoos, and a little more time getting involved and getting informed and getting down to city council and getting down to the state legislature.
[02:10:57.548 --> 02:11:05.912]  Because I want to slap you upside the head every time, you know, we go down to the legislature and beat some gun control bells and I don't see all the good old boys with the hunters for George Bush down there.
[02:11:06.892 --> 02:11:12.535]  No, you just want to stick a sticker on your car and swagger around like you're some type of conservative when you're really an enemy of America.
[02:11:12.555 --> 02:11:14.495]  And I'm serious.
[02:11:14.536 --> 02:11:18.057]  The yuppies who think George Bush is conservative, you're enemies of this country.
[02:11:19.598 --> 02:11:20.478]  You are enemies!
[02:11:21.579 --> 02:11:23.760]  You're an enemy of my family, and you're an enemy of me.
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.681]  And bad cops, you're an enemy of my family in this country, too.
[02:11:27.081 --> 02:11:29.062]  It's time to get serious and to get mean.
[02:11:29.722 --> 02:11:30.963]  And just start
[02:11:31.809 --> 02:11:32.149]  Puh!
[02:11:32.650 --> 02:11:33.270]  Just spittin'!
[02:11:33.310 --> 02:11:34.250]  I just spit right on the table!
[02:11:34.291 --> 02:11:35.251]  Just spittin' right in front!
[02:11:35.611 --> 02:11:37.552]  Oh, but they'll charge you with Al-Qaeda attack now.
[02:11:37.592 --> 02:11:38.733]  They call that a terror attack.
[02:11:39.133 --> 02:11:40.054]  Even spittin' on the ground.
[02:11:41.735 --> 02:11:44.857]  Point is, it's just, just, just, just, literally, just puh!
[02:11:44.997 --> 02:11:45.677]  That's what you are!
[02:11:46.258 --> 02:11:46.998]  You're scum!
[02:11:48.979 --> 02:11:53.402]  You're just like pot-bellied Germans that went along with Hitler, because they like the fancy uniforms and all the bull.
[02:11:55.623 --> 02:11:59.045]  Reese in New York, then we'll go to Danny in Staten Island and others.
[02:11:59.085 --> 02:11:59.686]  Thanks for holding.
[02:11:59.726 --> 02:12:00.346]  Reese, you're on the air.
[02:12:02.717 --> 02:12:04.038]  Okay, he's listening to the radio.
[02:12:04.398 --> 02:12:05.358]  Reese, you gonna come to the phone?
[02:12:06.579 --> 02:12:08.419]  Put him on hold for a minute, we'll try to come back to him.
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:13.481]  Let's go ahead and go to Danny in Staten Island.
[02:12:13.501 --> 02:12:14.061]  You're on the air.
[02:12:15.302 --> 02:12:16.082]  What's up, Alex?
[02:12:17.063 --> 02:12:18.603]  Listen, I had to bail from work today.
[02:12:18.623 --> 02:12:23.065]  I was listening to your show, and I heard you talk about the NYPD, so I had to call.
[02:12:23.105 --> 02:12:25.326]  I had to call up any time you were talking about the cops.
[02:12:26.046 --> 02:12:28.267]  And I didn't want to call the trash nobody.
[02:12:28.327 --> 02:12:30.008]  I'm not anti-cop or anything.
[02:12:30.068 --> 02:12:30.628]  As a matter of fact,
[02:12:31.178 --> 02:12:33.899]  I have some good friends that are police officers in my line of work.
[02:12:34.339 --> 02:12:38.640]  I've been in the homes and private homes of police officers, and it's like a two-sided coin with them.
[02:12:39.321 --> 02:12:43.162]  It's like, when they have their uniform off and their badges off, they're totally different people.
[02:12:43.202 --> 02:12:44.082]  They're just like you and me.
[02:12:44.122 --> 02:12:51.144]  For example, I'm talking to a cop who was the first responder down at Ground Zero, who's sick, and his brother's terminally sick.
[02:12:51.184 --> 02:13:00.187]  And I asked him how does it feel that the government lied about having airsafe to breathe and, you know, having people go down there, and now his brother's dying and he's sick as well.
[02:13:00.802 --> 02:13:16.671]  No, yeah, the kid, he was upset about it, and he was actually, I was giving him your website, 104 Prison Planet, 911truth.org, I referenced him for your, um, Terror Storm and Martial Law, Roots Change, and he told me, like, as soon as you guys leave the house, I'm going on those websites, and he sounded very interested, like he wanted to learn.
[02:13:17.171 --> 02:13:26.817]  And then you have the police officers when they're in uniform, for example, we were over there on Times Square on Monday, had the banner out, and police were slowing down while we got the banner out on Times Square, rolling down their windows,
[02:13:27.301 --> 02:13:29.182]  They were pathetic, were a disgrace.
[02:13:29.222 --> 02:13:36.406]  Like, these are police officers that are there, like, their job is to, like, you know, protect our rights, protect our First Amendment rights, and here we are, like, sticking up for them.
[02:13:37.106 --> 02:13:44.631]  And they're coming down with the windows down, starting with us, saying, you know, fold the banner up with pathetic, and we know, we try to hand them a flyer, get that stuff out of my face.
[02:13:44.671 --> 02:13:48.333]  I'm trying to really, like, clean up the language that they were using, but they really sounded unprofessional.
[02:13:48.353 --> 02:13:52.355]  You know, and they came like a gang of eight or nine of them, made us fold up the banner and leave, and
[02:13:52.884 --> 02:13:55.769]  I remember last Saturday, my boy AJ came from Staten Island.
[02:13:55.789 --> 02:13:57.932]  He came down to Ground Hill to hand out flyers with us.
[02:13:58.453 --> 02:14:00.215]  He tried to give one to a Port Authority cop.
[02:14:00.636 --> 02:14:05.884]  And the Port Authority cop told him, get that out of my face before I slam you to the ground and shove that flyer down your throat.
[02:14:06.825 --> 02:14:07.667]  Do you have video of that?
[02:14:08.718 --> 02:14:12.601]  I know he was being followed around by one of us for the camera.
[02:14:12.661 --> 02:14:15.124]  I wasn't there exactly, but I think there's video of that, yeah.
[02:14:15.704 --> 02:14:17.526]  See, you need to put that on YouTube.
[02:14:17.566 --> 02:14:19.227]  That's why they're wanting to ban cameras.
[02:14:19.807 --> 02:14:21.329]  I mean, no, I've had them act like that.
[02:14:21.369 --> 02:14:27.694]  I mean, hardcore mafia-type criminal behavior, and they just think we're here to be their slaves.
[02:14:28.135 --> 02:14:31.657]  I mean, it's like putting the mafia that would shake down grocery stores in uniforms.
[02:14:32.018 --> 02:14:32.919]  It's even worse.
[02:14:33.759 --> 02:14:34.080]  Go ahead.
[02:14:37.831 --> 02:14:39.711]  Alright, I was just saying, it's been happening for a while.
[02:14:39.731 --> 02:14:44.953]  I mean, I've just been doing this for a couple of weeks getting active, but I mean, I was blackmailed by a cop when I was 19.
[02:14:45.453 --> 02:14:49.434]  I was driving around, I got a ticket, and I, you know, I expressed my feelings about it.
[02:14:49.454 --> 02:14:51.514]  I was working, and I was working for a restaurant.
[02:14:51.534 --> 02:14:52.394]  I was delivering food.
[02:14:52.715 --> 02:14:55.015]  I would always deliver food to the precinct right around the corner.
[02:14:55.715 --> 02:14:58.796]  I was never bothered by the police, but these two particular officers, they were young.
[02:14:59.338 --> 02:14:59.818]  I know what I know.
[02:14:59.838 --> 02:15:04.401]  If you want to argue, now we're giving you another ticket for being out of the car with your car on it.
[02:15:04.462 --> 02:15:06.063]  Came and took my license out of my hand.
[02:15:06.363 --> 02:15:09.045]  There will be a second ticket and then say, you got anything else to say?
[02:15:09.585 --> 02:15:12.267]  With a muffler sound a little too loud, like trying to blackmail you.
[02:15:12.507 --> 02:15:13.448]  Don't blackmail me.
[02:15:13.488 --> 02:15:15.629]  If I say anything again, they're going to write me another ticket.
[02:15:16.029 --> 02:15:17.510]  So at that point, I just shut my mouth.
[02:15:17.771 --> 02:15:22.394]  But I did call the civility complaint review board, which is, uh, I think it's like an agency.
[02:15:22.414 --> 02:15:24.095]  That's right into a black hole, yeah.
[02:15:24.764 --> 02:15:29.848]  Yeah, and as a matter of fact, I dropped the case at the CCRB because I beat the victim in traffic court.
[02:15:29.888 --> 02:15:35.012]  The cop never showed up when I challenged him, probably because he was getting harassed by the CCRB, and they wouldn't let it go.
[02:15:35.032 --> 02:15:39.435]  I mean, I dropped the case... No, it is good to file complaints on them, because that does hurt their record.
[02:15:39.996 --> 02:15:40.836]  No, I mean, it's simple.
[02:15:40.936 --> 02:15:48.262]  I'm a human being, I have value, and somebody out of The Sopranos walks over in a uniform and starts yelling at me, I'm just not putting up with it.
[02:15:49.145 --> 02:15:50.065]  And I mean, I'm done.
[02:15:50.085 --> 02:15:50.606]  I'm done.
[02:15:50.626 --> 02:15:52.586]  I'm done and I'm finished dealing with it.
[02:15:52.866 --> 02:15:53.546]  And I don't care.
[02:15:54.147 --> 02:15:55.307]  And I've just had enough.
[02:15:55.687 --> 02:15:56.347]  And yeah, no, no.
[02:15:57.048 --> 02:16:03.310]  Thousands of police and firemen have already died from 9-11 attacks that were carried out by the globalists.
[02:16:03.390 --> 02:16:05.370]  Thousands are dying from the inhalation.
[02:16:05.810 --> 02:16:12.332]  And I remember being there in 2004 and cops laughing and calling me a conspiracy terrorist that they breathed poison.
[02:16:12.713 --> 02:16:13.753]  Now they don't laugh.
[02:16:14.708 --> 02:16:18.491]  And I had about 65% of the cops on our side being friendly.
[02:16:18.811 --> 02:16:20.212]  Hey Alex, I like the website.
[02:16:21.073 --> 02:16:23.115]  Even a lot of the higher level cops were being really friendly.
[02:16:23.135 --> 02:16:24.055]  We have it all on tape.
[02:16:24.856 --> 02:16:30.420]  But man, like 20-30% were just the scum of the earth.
[02:16:31.741 --> 02:16:33.483]  And I finally stopped being nice.
[02:16:33.523 --> 02:16:34.524]  I said, go ahead and arrest me.
[02:16:35.564 --> 02:16:36.245]  And I'm going to sue you.
[02:16:36.992 --> 02:16:38.793]  And of course they knew it, too, though, is the key.
[02:16:39.013 --> 02:16:39.973]  You can't just threaten that.
[02:16:40.013 --> 02:16:41.874]  I mean, I'm committed to it.
[02:16:42.214 --> 02:16:42.854]  And they can tell.
[02:16:42.894 --> 02:16:43.414]  They telegraph.
[02:16:43.434 --> 02:16:44.875]  They get that, and they just leave you alone.
[02:16:46.295 --> 02:16:47.956]  But anything else you want to add, Danny?
[02:16:48.616 --> 02:16:52.278]  Well, no, that was basically about the police and about, like, the filming now.
[02:16:52.298 --> 02:16:53.478]  They're trying to pass these laws.
[02:16:53.718 --> 02:16:58.880]  What do you say to them, though, when they run up to you and start screaming and cussing at you?
[02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:03.101]  Well, when I was younger, you know, I didn't really know my rights as a person.
[02:17:03.121 --> 02:17:03.742]  You know, I was, like, 19, 20.
[02:17:04.952 --> 02:17:15.484]  I was taught to be scared of the police, and whenever they come up to you, you know, if they pull you over, yes sir, no sir, like they're guards, you know, like they're somebody that you gotta look up to, that they're not on your level as a citizen of this country.
[02:17:15.924 --> 02:17:22.772]  Nowadays, when someone comes up to me, whether it's a police officer, a police authority cop, or anybody like some sort of authority, remember,
[02:17:23.291 --> 02:17:26.575]  When that badge is off and that gun is off and no one's doing it, it's just like you.
[02:17:26.595 --> 02:17:28.316]  So you don't take anything to suspect from anybody.
[02:17:28.377 --> 02:17:30.499]  I don't take anything to suspect from anybody.
[02:17:30.539 --> 02:17:37.627]  How in the land of the free and home of the brave get to a point where Americans bow to police and stoop over like we're in Guatemala?
[02:17:38.247 --> 02:17:39.368]  Man, I'm not putting up with it.
[02:17:39.429 --> 02:17:39.949]  Good job.
[02:17:39.969 --> 02:17:40.710]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:40.730 --> 02:17:41.711]  Can you get me that video?
[02:17:41.731 --> 02:17:42.312]  That sounds great.
[02:17:42.352 --> 02:17:42.652]  Stay there.
[02:17:45.695 --> 02:17:48.718]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:17:49.038 --> 02:17:53.962]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:17:54.203 --> 02:17:58.567]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:17:58.867 --> 02:18:07.775]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:18:07.995 --> 02:18:11.578]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:18:11.878 --> 02:18:16.924]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:18:17.205 --> 02:18:23.913]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:18:24.426 --> 02:18:25.086]  What about you?
[02:18:25.726 --> 02:18:31.087]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:18:34.288 --> 02:18:36.768]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:18:52.415 --> 02:18:57.238]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:57.439 --> 02:19:00.180]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:19:00.221 --> 02:19:01.341]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:19:02.682 --> 02:19:07.285]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:08.206 --> 02:19:15.471]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:19:16.472 --> 02:19:19.514]  Midas Resources is offering the red buck and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[02:19:21.667 --> 02:19:25.130]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[02:19:37.459 --> 02:19:37.819]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:47.461]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:19:47.602 --> 02:19:48.863]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:19:49.103 --> 02:19:51.925]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:19:52.305 --> 02:19:55.047]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:19:55.608 --> 02:20:02.353]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:20:52.171 --> 02:20:54.594]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's dynamite in the garden.
[02:20:54.814 --> 02:21:01.180]  Proto-Gro is a bioactive superfood for plants that works by providing true broad spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their full genetic
[02:21:01.841 --> 02:21:02.942]  What does this mean in the garden?
[02:21:03.022 --> 02:21:14.331]  It needs mouth-watering fruits and vegetables, brilliantly colored flowers, herbs that finally grow to medicinal strength, blue-ribbon garden produce jam-packed with bioavailable minerals and trace elements, giant pumpkins, even high-potency high-bricks wheatgrass.
[02:21:14.412 --> 02:21:17.474]  Proto-Gro is a proprietary blend of full-spectrum nutrients from the sea.
[02:21:17.614 --> 02:21:20.197]  It literally contains the basic building blocks of life itself.
[02:21:20.417 --> 02:21:27.423]  In fact, Proto-Gro is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record time that it almost forces plants to grow even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[02:21:27.683 --> 02:21:32.366]  It's also perfect for growing your own survival foods and might just be the ultimate hard times barter item.

[02:21:59.276 --> 02:22:01.358]  All right, Mark, you're on the air.
[02:22:01.378 --> 02:22:02.219]  Where are you calling from?
[02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:06.222]  Okay, Mark's not there.
[02:22:06.262 --> 02:22:07.463]  Let's go to Chris in Kentucky.
[02:22:07.903 --> 02:22:08.684]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:22:08.724 --> 02:22:09.084]  Welcome.
[02:22:10.745 --> 02:22:11.206]  Hello, Alex.
[02:22:11.506 --> 02:22:12.267]  Yes, Chris, go ahead.
[02:22:12.467 --> 02:22:13.648]  Yes, I just wanted to hit something.
[02:22:13.928 --> 02:22:16.030]  I'm just a little fed up with what's going on out here.
[02:22:16.050 --> 02:22:20.773]  About two weeks ago, we had a deputy that was killed over across the river in Indiana.
[02:22:21.774 --> 02:22:26.538]  And this news report, the way it was put out, you know, the kid didn't, he said he was on MySpace.
[02:22:27.043 --> 02:22:28.943]  And did something that is going to take out this kid.
[02:22:29.003 --> 02:22:33.984]  This kid had no record prior to this, and I'm looking at this, this is somewhere near Virginia Tech.
[02:22:34.344 --> 02:22:37.525]  There's no mention of any drugs, Prozac, nothing.
[02:22:37.965 --> 02:22:39.685]  And another thing about the... Well, I don't know.
[02:22:39.725 --> 02:22:41.086]  I mean, I don't know about the story.
[02:22:41.126 --> 02:22:41.586]  What happened?
[02:22:42.166 --> 02:22:49.587]  Well, a 15-year-old, apparently there was a domestic disturbance or something going on at the house, and he took out a deputy when he arrived there.
[02:22:49.947 --> 02:22:54.948]  And the news media got it in right away, and the thing that they did on the news that made me mad
[02:22:55.600 --> 02:23:09.130]  Well, I clearly committed suicide, but what the conditioning method was, they have armored vehicles, FBI, ATF, Secret Service, local Metro Police Department, and armored vehicles all going around the house with this mass conditioning, and I was just absolutely angry.
[02:23:09.370 --> 02:23:23.040]  Well, after everybody's dead, they've still got to drive the APCs around in circles as a show of force, and any time something bad happens, yeah, they will try to mix in the Internet, and then the Internet's going to get you, and the Internet's going to cause a problem, and the Internet's going to bite you.
[02:23:23.737 --> 02:23:29.791]  Yeah, and this is similar to Virginia Tech, no mention of it, and I'm not buying this story.
[02:23:31.401 --> 02:23:38.668]  Well, I mean, there are real terrorists, there are real shooters, there are real problems.
[02:23:39.269 --> 02:23:40.871]  There's 300 million people here in this country.
[02:23:41.331 --> 02:23:48.418]  The media has conditioned us also that we need to just give up rights or slit our wrists or submit to world government if there's anything wrong happening.
[02:23:48.778 --> 02:23:49.699]  I appreciate your call.
[02:23:49.719 --> 02:23:51.040]  Let's talk to Paul in London.
[02:23:51.501 --> 02:23:54.284]  Paul, are the folks in England buying this new
[02:23:55.063 --> 02:23:58.704]  This new staged event as if it's real with their new leader Lord Brown?
[02:24:12.371 --> 02:24:16.415]  Our terror law is tough enough, and 73% responded no.
[02:24:16.735 --> 02:24:25.582]  Oh, and of course Lord Brown is saying that he wants the secret arrest provision expanded within minutes of the attack.
[02:24:26.803 --> 02:24:27.884]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:24:28.344 --> 02:24:39.593]  And there is just one caveat that unfortunately three soldiers died in Iraq, and two of them were from his hometown.
[02:24:40.089 --> 02:24:42.671]  Now they can't arrange that, I think we just got lucky there.
[02:24:43.392 --> 02:24:59.505]  So the question now being asked, there's a new poll, they have this number 10 poll site where you can ask for changes to government policy and the question is, we want a referendum on Europe.
[02:25:00.346 --> 02:25:04.189]  And 90% of the population wants it, we're just being ignored.
[02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:25.739]  Now, for those who don't know what a referendum on Europe means, Blair traitorously signed on for EU expansion and for England to go underneath the European Union's laws, which completely throw out any common law, any jurisprudence, any of the Magna Carta's conditions in that Covenant of 1215, which is the basis of our Bill of Rights and Constitution here.
[02:25:26.540 --> 02:25:33.403]  And Brown is trying to keep that in place that Blair, as a dictator, put in in his last days in office.
[02:25:34.579 --> 02:25:45.048]  But the good news is you're saying 10 Downing Street has a comment area, that's newsworthy, and 90% want to be able to vote on this question.
[02:25:45.068 --> 02:25:48.530]  The poll wants us out of Europe completely.
[02:25:48.570 --> 02:25:51.553]  This one they can't win, they absolutely know they can't win this.
[02:25:51.973 --> 02:25:56.737]  As far as the terror situation is concerned, unfortunately most of my countrymen have not got a clue.
[02:25:58.208 --> 02:25:59.589]  Well, I don't know if you can trust.
[02:25:59.769 --> 02:26:02.812]  I mean, we know every poll that comes out shows between 85 and 95 percent.
[02:26:02.952 --> 02:26:07.215]  I've seen different polls all in those areas.
[02:26:08.156 --> 02:26:10.398]  One out of Europe, and everybody you talk to doesn't want to.
[02:26:10.418 --> 02:26:11.819]  I mean, Europe wants out of Europe.
[02:26:11.879 --> 02:26:13.901]  I mean, they hate the EU as well.
[02:26:14.201 --> 02:26:17.343]  It's totally tyrannical, a whole new layer of bureaucracy and taxes.
[02:26:17.363 --> 02:26:19.305]  The U.S., 99 percent.
[02:26:21.599 --> 02:26:28.187]  And CNN polls don't want to be part of the North American Union, so the media just denies it exists and publicly announces that they're merging them.
[02:26:28.852 --> 02:26:51.963]  I mean, it's like they deny they want the Fairness Doctrine, again, like the Patriot Act, it has that double-speak name, the Fairness, the Unfair Doctrine, and they've introduced it, the FCC's moving to pass it again, that will literally shut down talk radio, folks, there was no talk radio before this with any politics, and then they just deny it exists while they speak on Fox News calling for it with Boxer.
[02:26:52.604 --> 02:26:54.264]  I mean, it's just off the charts.
[02:26:56.326 --> 02:26:56.506]  Yeah.
[02:26:58.084 --> 02:27:04.508]  One of the major papers is saying that an Islamic website predicted the London bombings hours before they actually did happen, you know, they say they planted them.
[02:27:04.929 --> 02:27:14.035]  Yeah, that CBS News was London scare heralded on web, and it's always some message board, some Fed goes on there and posts, and that's shown as absolute proof.
[02:27:14.475 --> 02:27:15.596]  Did you want to comment on that?
[02:27:16.757 --> 02:27:20.599]  No, I mean, it's just very typical of what I hear from people.
[02:27:20.639 --> 02:27:24.522]  I mean, when I speak to people, they say, this is going on, I say, you're still reading newspapers.
[02:27:25.122 --> 02:27:27.063]  And then, of course, I've directed them to ProofOfPlanet.tv.
[02:27:28.311 --> 02:27:30.613]  Um, I find it sad.
[02:27:30.633 --> 02:27:31.754]  Stay there, Paul!
[02:27:31.814 --> 02:27:32.274]  Stay there!
[02:27:36.217 --> 02:27:37.138]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.619 --> 02:27:39.240]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:28:52.735 --> 02:28:53.895]  He's in a dive.
[02:28:53.915 --> 02:28:56.176]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[02:28:56.496 --> 02:28:57.257]  Let's go look.
[02:28:59.497 --> 02:29:02.658]  I'm Nonix Man and your toenails need Nonix Nail Gel.

[02:30:46.281 --> 02:31:13.913]  Alright, we're about to go to the folks from Seattle 9-11 Truth here in just a moment to get an update on how they confronted... Not even really confronted, just talked to Norman Mineta on that big news that broke.
[02:31:14.500 --> 02:31:31.856]  Of course, last Monday, concerning the stand down Dick Cheney ordered, and I want to get Luke Rodowski to pop in too, we're getting him on the line, to discuss Bloomberg sending on a ban filming the police in New York, especially what it comes down to.
[02:31:33.197 --> 02:31:38.001]  But, you know, I had my sheet here in front of me, and now I don't have it.
[02:31:38.842 --> 02:31:40.864]  Who is it that we have from Seattle, 9-11 Truth?
[02:31:44.019 --> 02:31:44.780]  Bob Berner?
[02:31:45.701 --> 02:31:46.922]  Okay, I haven't talked to Bob yet.
[02:31:47.002 --> 02:31:48.264]  I know we set him up for the show.
[02:31:48.284 --> 02:31:50.907]  Uh, Bob, what's going on, man?
[02:31:51.607 --> 02:31:52.168]  Oh, not enough.
[02:31:52.208 --> 02:31:53.029]  Just in Seattle here.
[02:31:53.069 --> 02:31:53.629]  It's Brenner.
[02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:55.031]  Runner with a B in front of it.
[02:31:55.752 --> 02:31:56.533]  How are you, Alex?
[02:31:57.053 --> 02:31:58.935]  I'm not doing good, if you want to call me.
[02:31:59.256 --> 02:32:00.437]  The movement's full of scum.
[02:32:00.477 --> 02:32:01.418]  Everything's falling apart.
[02:32:01.998 --> 02:32:05.983]  The whole country's going to hell in a handbasket, and the economy's unraveling right now, so...
[02:32:06.866 --> 02:32:12.830]  Well, yeah, but we just need to continue with our truth actions here and be out on the street and be visible.
[02:32:13.230 --> 02:32:14.411]  Everybody needs to get involved.
[02:32:14.511 --> 02:32:15.132]  Now's the time.
[02:32:16.152 --> 02:32:16.953]  No, I agree with you.
[02:32:17.773 --> 02:32:20.735]  It's kind of the best of times, worst of times.
[02:32:20.775 --> 02:32:22.156]  I'm really positive in many respects.
[02:32:22.216 --> 02:32:23.537]  I'm negative in others.
[02:32:23.557 --> 02:32:24.818]  I guess we should just be positive.
[02:32:24.838 --> 02:32:25.799]  People are waking up.
[02:32:26.239 --> 02:32:27.240]  They are getting involved.
[02:32:27.300 --> 02:32:28.581]  They are taking action.
[02:32:29.481 --> 02:32:29.621]  Yeah.
[02:32:29.881 --> 02:32:32.043]  But the New World Order is coming down like a ton of bricks.
[02:32:33.084 --> 02:32:33.464]  No doubt.
[02:32:33.724 --> 02:32:34.064]  No doubt.
[02:32:34.625 --> 02:32:36.626]  Well, tell us about the Norman Mineta situation.
[02:32:37.498 --> 02:32:41.720]  This was a luncheon for the Washington State Transportation Policy.
[02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:50.783]  Mineta actually shared a table with Slade Gordon, who was on the 9-11 Commission, which I thought was kind of ironic.
[02:32:51.603 --> 02:33:03.427]  The talk here at the Transportation Policy was about Washington State warming up to the public and private getting together for
[02:33:06.932 --> 02:33:14.636]  I'm sorry, I have some notes here, but much like the Trans-Texas Corridor, they're trying to warm Washington State up to that idea with our roadways here.
[02:33:16.337 --> 02:33:30.384]  So we approached Mignetta afterwards at the conclusion, and Mignetta confirmed a lot of what we already know in the Truth Movement, that both the Vice President Cheney and Lynne Cheney were in the PEOC when he arrived.
[02:33:31.685 --> 02:33:35.066]  And we have, he was unaware of
[02:33:36.872 --> 02:33:46.136]  The commission saying that Cheney arrived at 9.58, which kind of says that Mignetta hasn't read the report himself either.
[02:33:50.598 --> 02:33:51.338]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:33:54.619 --> 02:34:03.523]  We did talk to Mignetta about the plane being out 50 miles, 30 miles, and the young man coming in saying,
[02:34:04.332 --> 02:34:06.074]  Do the orders still stand?
[02:34:06.134 --> 02:34:09.897]  And Cheney whipped his neck around and said, of course the orders still stand.
[02:34:09.937 --> 02:34:12.740]  Have you heard anything to the contrary?
[02:34:13.401 --> 02:34:23.971]  Now, something did hit the Pentagon, and if it was a shoot-down order, then that order was not followed.
[02:34:27.850 --> 02:34:36.774]  So, when we asked Mineta, you stated that you actually thought it was a shoot-down order when, in fact, you learned later that was not the case.
[02:34:37.915 --> 02:34:38.895]  And there's a pause.
[02:34:38.935 --> 02:34:43.578]  Mineta responds with a pause and makes eye contact with us and says, yes.
[02:34:44.638 --> 02:34:49.780]  He later goes into Shanksville with his testimony to the Commission.
[02:34:50.241 --> 02:34:57.084]  There was no specific order to shoot down 93 in his statement to the Commission.
[02:34:59.335 --> 02:35:14.967]  So basically, we still have to do a lot of work on shedding light on the distortions and emissions with the official report surrounding this, but I just want to encourage everybody to get out with their video crews and get on the urban camouflage and get out there.
[02:35:15.227 --> 02:35:20.451]  Well, Bob Berner, I really appreciate the work you've done at SeattleTruth.org.
[02:35:20.491 --> 02:35:25.135]  I had a folder here with all your info and I was scrambling around for it and I did find it here.
[02:35:25.895 --> 02:35:28.097]  The proper website is SeattleTruth.org, right?
[02:35:28.917 --> 02:35:34.258]  I don't know why I was giving wrong information.
[02:35:34.278 --> 02:35:34.919]  I apologize.
[02:35:34.959 --> 02:35:35.799]  I should have done it myself.
[02:35:36.199 --> 02:35:36.659]  That's alright.
[02:35:36.799 --> 02:35:40.200]  It doesn't take much for a true squad to get out there.
[02:35:40.220 --> 02:35:41.360]  You know, two or three guys.
[02:35:42.881 --> 02:35:48.042]  I learned the term urban camouflage from you and it really works well if we want to get in close to these guys.
[02:35:49.035 --> 02:35:55.379]  Well, you know, I certainly didn't coin Gonzo Journalism for the last 13 years doing this.
[02:35:55.399 --> 02:36:00.623]  There's been folks doing it the last few months who claim they coined these truth squads, which is fine and dandy.
[02:36:00.703 --> 02:36:04.185]  Frankly, I don't care who coins what or who does what or, you know, who does.
[02:36:04.345 --> 02:36:13.991]  All I care about, Bob Brunner, is the fact that you've done this and I want to commend you for what you've done from the bottom of my heart because this country is in dire straits.
[02:36:14.451 --> 02:36:16.833]  This planet is in dire straits right now.
[02:36:17.911 --> 02:36:27.597]  And I couldn't keep going on doing what I'm doing if it wasn't for all the wonderful, predominantly young people out there doing what you're doing right now.
[02:36:27.817 --> 02:36:34.180]  Let me check InfoWars.com and see if we got your website up there today.
[02:36:35.201 --> 02:36:37.562]  And we sure do have it up there.
[02:36:37.722 --> 02:36:38.523]  That's great.
[02:36:39.383 --> 02:36:41.725]  We also have a community... No, it's classic.
[02:36:41.765 --> 02:36:42.205]  I'm sorry.
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:47.262]  They have a link to 9-11 Truth Seattle and it's numbersusa.com.
[02:36:47.302 --> 02:36:48.483]  That's how we roll around here.
[02:36:49.244 --> 02:36:53.266]  And so we'll get that fixed for you right now.
[02:36:56.208 --> 02:37:03.633]  There's a community link out there for anybody out there that is into the 9-11 Truth and is studying this but doesn't have a group of their own yet.
[02:37:04.714 --> 02:37:10.958]  There's a form there where you can sign up and start one of your own and get people in your community active.
[02:37:13.582 --> 02:37:21.686]  And one thing is that there's a really important tool that we can use are the new iPods that are out that allow you to play video.
[02:37:22.107 --> 02:37:37.435]  If people load up truth clips on those when they're out doing their truth movements or if they're going to do a video truth squad with, you know, either local public servants or local media and have, you know, small clips of Building 7 saying, you know, do you have any thoughts on Building 7?
[02:37:38.422 --> 02:37:41.084]  And get that on video and get it up on YouTube.
[02:37:41.644 --> 02:37:49.049]  If people start recognizing that the people they're getting their daily news from aren't up on these issues, we're going to make even more of a change.
[02:37:51.291 --> 02:37:55.053]  Well, we are, my friend, and it's good to have new blood in here fighting the New World Order.
[02:37:55.073 --> 02:38:02.098]  Speaking of new blood, let's talk to 20-year-old Luke Radowsky, who last night was confronting the globalists at the Democratic presidential debates.
[02:38:03.342 --> 02:38:04.643]  I mean, it's beautiful.
[02:38:04.663 --> 02:38:05.745]  I mean, it's really taken back America.
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:23.102]  Being the change you want to see in this world, and we are changing it.
[02:38:23.322 --> 02:38:31.446]  The corporate media won't ask the hard questions, so citizens, patriots, are asking these questions themselves, and are asking the hard questions, and we are demanding the answers.
[02:38:31.786 --> 02:38:33.807]  That's what we did yesterday at the PBS debates.
[02:38:34.688 --> 02:38:41.091]  I actually came up to Bill Richardson, I shook his hand, looked him right in the eyes, and I asked him, you know,
[02:38:41.641 --> 02:38:48.923]  Sir, you gave a keynote speech at the Bohemia Grove Club, where they, you know, openly have satanic worship and mock child sacrifices.
[02:38:48.963 --> 02:38:50.343]  What was your business there, sir?
[02:38:50.823 --> 02:38:57.705]  In front of everybody, this gentleman looks at me, he starts sweating, and then he just turns around and takes another question.
[02:38:57.725 --> 02:38:58.945]  He didn't even address me.
[02:38:59.465 --> 02:39:05.506]  Then we also confronted Christopher Dodd and asked him about how he passed, how he voted for the National ID Act.
[02:39:05.986 --> 02:39:08.347]  And he didn't even know he voted for it.
[02:39:08.755 --> 02:39:21.487]  That's how blatant, that's how stupid these politicians are, and that's why we the people need to take this country back, one YouTube video at a time, by confronting these politicians, by, you know, going against the media and asking the hard questions.
[02:39:23.048 --> 02:39:23.569]  I agree.
[02:39:24.229 --> 02:39:28.093]  This affects everybody, because whatever New York does, the rest of the country does, and all over the nation,
[02:39:28.797 --> 02:39:47.444]  From Tennessee to Texas, from New York to Oregon, every few days, let's say every three days, I see reports of people videotaping cops out their window, people have a surveillance thing on their house, the cops beat their kid up, the cops go ahead and arrest the parents and seize the cameras, saying it's eavesdropping or wiretapping, of course it isn't, that's not what the law says.
[02:39:48.424 --> 02:39:48.904]  I think so.
[02:40:09.182 --> 02:40:10.264]  I mean it should.
[02:40:10.684 --> 02:40:12.346]  We're going to Ground Zero on 9-11.
[02:40:12.366 --> 02:40:13.027]  We're going to be there.
[02:40:13.047 --> 02:40:14.749]  And I'm going to have cameras if I want.
[02:40:15.270 --> 02:40:22.439]  And I promise, I promise, any cops who lay their hands on me, any cops who take me to jail, I promise you,
[02:40:23.539 --> 02:40:30.902]  I don't care about money, and whatever money I got, I will spend it making your life a living hell, you pieces of un-American scum.
[02:40:30.922 --> 02:40:32.643]  We definitely have to fight this.
[02:40:32.763 --> 02:40:36.385]  Mayor Bloomberg is actually launching an attack on the First Amendment.
[02:40:36.585 --> 02:40:40.767]  He's trying to propose laws and bills that will make it illegal for anybody to film
[02:40:42.048 --> 02:40:48.252]  Look, before he does this, I want you to go protest Bloomberg News, because they're doing this also to shut down any competition.
[02:40:48.753 --> 02:40:58.900]  He's involved in racketeering here, using his police power to try to shut down competition for big corporations so nobody can afford to buy, because even for independent media, you're not letting them work.
[02:40:59.260 --> 02:41:01.001]  Then also, they're claiming it's under entertainment.
[02:41:01.041 --> 02:41:02.722]  We're free speech and news gathering.
[02:41:03.223 --> 02:41:04.083]  That's another key.
[02:41:04.644 --> 02:41:08.907]  And again, Bloomberg uses taxpayer money to pay for all the lawsuits he's going to lose.
[02:41:10.888 --> 02:41:13.611]  You want to comment on this Bob Berner?
[02:41:14.492 --> 02:41:30.631]  I certainly hope we don't see our local officials getting behind that but I mean we just need to be out in the streets not only on the 11th but whenever we have you know a lot of us are working citizens and we just need to be out there every our off days need to be days out on the street.
[02:41:31.644 --> 02:41:32.104]  Oh yeah, man.
[02:41:32.144 --> 02:41:34.145]  We're definitely going to set up protests also.
[02:41:34.165 --> 02:41:35.866]  We're going to set it up later.
[02:41:35.886 --> 02:41:37.727]  It's going to be on the website, WeAreChange.org.
[02:41:37.987 --> 02:41:40.608]  But for the meantime, people could call Bloomberg's office at 212-639-9675.
[02:41:40.648 --> 02:41:41.348]  That's 212-639-9675.
[02:41:41.368 --> 02:41:43.689]  And tell him he can't destroy the First Amendment.
[02:41:43.709 --> 02:41:44.790]  He can't do this.
[02:41:44.850 --> 02:41:47.651]  This is a blatant violation of our freedoms.
[02:41:56.565 --> 02:42:02.187]  And people have to understand the camcorder, the video camcorder, is really the new weapon of the revolution.
[02:42:02.447 --> 02:42:04.188]  It's the new wave of the Infowar.
[02:42:04.408 --> 02:42:09.949]  And this is the only way that we can take the minds back of the... Well, you need to confront that slimebag.
[02:42:10.590 --> 02:42:13.350]  You need to go to his offices.
[02:42:13.391 --> 02:42:14.891]  You need to go to the film offices.
[02:42:14.911 --> 02:42:17.812]  In fact, I have the notes here in front of me.
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:20.682]  Uh, I'm trying to find the phone numbers.
[02:42:20.742 --> 02:42:22.144]  I had them here in the stack earlier.
[02:42:22.524 --> 02:42:23.785]  I gave them out in the first hour.
[02:42:23.805 --> 02:42:28.310]  Bloomberg's office of film is located on, uh, 1697 Broadway.
[02:42:28.831 --> 02:42:30.373]  And, uh, we're going to set up a street action.
[02:42:30.393 --> 02:42:35.638]  We're going to set up a protest right in front of his, uh, compound, uh, later on, uh, this week, actually.
[02:42:36.099 --> 02:42:38.642]  And, uh, we're going to let him know where we think, and we're definitely going to try to squad him.
[02:42:39.298 --> 02:42:45.045]  But I'll tell you right now, I'll just call the mayor's office and tell them that this is a blatant violation of the First Amendment and that the people won't stand for this.
[02:42:45.326 --> 02:42:51.553]  I'm telling you right now, if this law passed, I'm going to be the first one in New York City to break this law, because this law is not American.
[02:42:51.573 --> 02:42:53.536]  This law is anything that we don't stand for.
[02:42:53.556 --> 02:42:55.258]  This is something that we have to fight for.
[02:42:56.798 --> 02:42:59.038]  Well, I agree with you, and you couldn't say it any better.
[02:42:59.619 --> 02:43:04.320]  It's like a pig pen in here, just in the news today, literally like hundreds of stories in front of me.
[02:43:04.340 --> 02:43:08.340]  I'm trying to find the numbers to Bloomberg I was giving out earlier in the first hour.
[02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:11.581]  It's important to call that scumbag and let him know you're not going to put up with it.
[02:43:12.661 --> 02:43:21.363]  Bob Brunner, again, tell us about the organization 9-11 Truth in Seattle, and give out the website again on air since I can't direct people over to InfoWars.
[02:43:21.923 --> 02:43:25.044]  It's simply 911truthseattle.org.
[02:43:25.064 --> 02:43:26.424]  We just had our meeting last night.
[02:43:27.003 --> 02:43:27.763]  A really good meeting.
[02:43:27.803 --> 02:43:30.165]  We got, you know, definitely more organized, more focused.
[02:43:30.185 --> 02:43:32.906]  We have an actual formal Truce Squad now.
[02:43:32.966 --> 02:43:33.687]  It's going to go out.
[02:43:33.727 --> 02:43:37.909]  We've been doing our actions on the 11th, and we've been getting really a great response.
[02:43:37.969 --> 02:43:40.890]  We're outside of Al Gore's event.
[02:43:40.930 --> 02:43:46.834]  We're outside of Barack Obama's event, and really getting some positive responses just all across.
[02:43:46.914 --> 02:43:49.755]  The people are definitely waking up out here on the West Coast.
[02:43:50.295 --> 02:43:53.057]  Oh, tell folks about the Barack Obama event.
[02:43:53.635 --> 02:44:09.971]  Well, he did a fundraiser here and, you know, a bunch of us were outside with banners handing out free DVDs and people on the way in were not so much receptive, but definitely on the way out it seemed like people were disappointed in what Barack was saying.
[02:44:10.371 --> 02:44:11.933]  That guy's a complete joke!
[02:44:12.791 --> 02:44:15.692]  And like the media is saying, since he's black, we've got to support him.
[02:44:16.153 --> 02:44:22.036]  I'll vote for a black person, a purple person, a green person, a pink person, but I'm not going to vote for New World Order.
[02:44:22.356 --> 02:44:23.596]  Look, this is how it's going to work.
[02:44:24.157 --> 02:44:27.358]  It's going to be Hillary with Barack Obama as the Vice President.
[02:44:27.398 --> 02:44:28.679]  That's totally staged.
[02:44:29.602 --> 02:44:31.324]  And people can't see through it, whatever.
[02:44:31.844 --> 02:44:40.271]  Yeah, people just, for Truth Actions and Video Truth Squads, just go online and look up Democratic and Republican fundraising.
[02:44:40.291 --> 02:44:43.174]  You're going to find out where these people are and where to have a presence.
[02:44:44.815 --> 02:44:45.456]  Good job.
[02:44:45.476 --> 02:44:49.479]  Again, give us that Seattle website.
[02:44:49.759 --> 02:44:51.421]  911truthseattle.org.
[02:44:53.883 --> 02:44:54.703]  Luke Radowski,
[02:44:56.491 --> 02:45:05.545]  You know, the police have already been trying to claim that you've got to have some type of special permit to videotape anywhere in the city.
[02:45:06.672 --> 02:45:11.855]  What makes these un-American trash think that they can put cameras up watching us all the time without a permit?
[02:45:11.875 --> 02:45:15.378]  I mean, this government in America telling you you can't film them, these scumbags?
[02:45:15.958 --> 02:45:18.079]  Again, they're upset, they're scared, and they should be.
[02:45:18.519 --> 02:45:24.843]  I mean, they're scared because these YouTube videos are coming out, and the truth is coming out, and we're confronting everybody, and they're scared.
[02:45:24.883 --> 02:45:26.424]  They're definitely probably scared of us.
[02:45:26.864 --> 02:45:30.927]  One thing we can't do is we can't allow our freedoms to become permissions.
[02:45:31.260 --> 02:45:32.901]  We can't allow this to happen.
[02:45:33.122 --> 02:45:44.431]  Oh yeah, I mean, in just a few years if this stays in New York and doesn't get challenged, I guarantee you that they'll be telling everybody that it's a privilege to even own a camera.
[02:45:45.192 --> 02:45:47.214]  You don't understand the evil of these scum, folks.
[02:45:47.254 --> 02:45:48.715]  I have all the Supreme Court rulings.
[02:45:49.436 --> 02:45:50.136]  I have it all.
[02:45:50.657 --> 02:45:54.140]  Driving is not a privilege, but these monkey brains think it is?
[02:45:54.972 --> 02:45:57.874]  These stupid monkey brains will sit there all day and tell you.
[02:45:58.074 --> 02:45:59.515]  They don't know they're hit from a hole in the ground.
[02:46:00.076 --> 02:46:01.437]  They don't know jack squat.
[02:46:02.878 --> 02:46:04.159]  I probably shouldn't even be on there today.
[02:46:04.199 --> 02:46:04.839]  I'm so hateful.
[02:46:04.939 --> 02:46:07.241]  I mean, I am just absolutely in a vicious mood.
[02:46:07.281 --> 02:46:08.342]  I'm gonna be honest with you guys.
[02:46:08.362 --> 02:46:09.423]  I'm in a negative mood.
[02:46:09.903 --> 02:46:10.844]  I'm in an angry mood.
[02:46:11.124 --> 02:46:16.528]  Probably just had about four hours sleep, but just, uh, and I'm so sick of the British scum over there.
[02:46:16.568 --> 02:46:17.849]  Those terrorist filth.
[02:46:18.029 --> 02:46:18.810]  Not the British people.
[02:46:19.437 --> 02:46:20.278]  But they're government.
[02:46:20.518 --> 02:46:22.179]  I told Paul in England I'd go back to them.
[02:46:22.219 --> 02:46:22.719]  I never did.
[02:46:22.739 --> 02:46:25.421]  I'd forgotten I was having you on, Bob.
[02:46:26.382 --> 02:46:32.066]  But is the caller from England there about how they're... Well, let's bring Paul back up from England.
[02:46:32.086 --> 02:46:34.348]  Let's bring him up with both these guys right before we go to break.
[02:46:34.728 --> 02:46:36.609]  Paul, you wanted to add something else.
[02:46:36.709 --> 02:46:38.631]  Aren't you sick of your scumbag government, too?
[02:46:39.151 --> 02:46:41.293]  Staging all these events and pulling all this business?
[02:46:44.935 --> 02:46:46.196]  Yes, he wasn't there.
[02:46:46.957 --> 02:46:47.457]  He wasn't there.
[02:46:54.950 --> 02:46:59.494]  All I know is, gentlemen, we need to get mad first before we're going to turn this country around.
[02:47:00.455 --> 02:47:02.697]  And in closing, Bob, anything else you want to add?
[02:47:02.717 --> 02:47:06.020]  No, just to encourage everybody to get out there.
[02:47:06.180 --> 02:47:08.603]  It's up to us to make the change.
[02:47:08.663 --> 02:47:09.304]  We've got to do it.
[02:47:11.451 --> 02:47:18.294]  It is up to us, Bob, and I appreciate what you've done, and as you continue, Bob, we want to have you back up, so I commend you, my friend, and thank you.
[02:47:18.855 --> 02:47:19.135]  Awesome.
[02:47:19.175 --> 02:47:19.775]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:47:19.815 --> 02:47:20.255]  Thank you, Luke.
[02:47:20.816 --> 02:47:21.236]  Have a good one.
[02:47:21.416 --> 02:47:22.336]  You bet.
[02:47:26.839 --> 02:47:32.481]  Luke, I don't normally get down as today with the economy and everything else to do, and I'm just sick of it, but I think we need to get sick of it.
[02:47:32.501 --> 02:47:35.003]  I think we need to get just violently angry.
[02:47:35.043 --> 02:47:35.483]  What do you think?
[02:47:36.215 --> 02:47:37.717]  I don't know about violently angry.
[02:47:37.777 --> 02:47:39.779]  I don't mean to be violent.
[02:47:39.819 --> 02:47:42.502]  I mean, we need to just be extremely angry.
[02:47:42.822 --> 02:47:43.583]  Oh yeah, I'm angry.
[02:47:43.843 --> 02:47:46.105]  I'm pissed off every day what's going on in America.
[02:47:46.125 --> 02:47:48.207]  I mean, I came here to America for freedom.
[02:47:48.388 --> 02:47:50.790]  I came from communist Poland here for freedom.
[02:47:50.810 --> 02:47:53.813]  And I'm seeing America turn something worse than what was in Poland.
[02:47:54.073 --> 02:47:57.677]  And it's pissing me off because this is something that America doesn't stand for.
[02:47:57.697 --> 02:47:58.738]  It doesn't stand for tyranny.
[02:47:58.758 --> 02:47:59.499]  It stands for freedom.
[02:47:59.864 --> 02:48:01.765]  And I'm pissed off, and we all need to get mad.
[02:48:02.025 --> 02:48:04.046]  But as far as getting mad, we also have to get educated.
[02:48:04.326 --> 02:48:08.649]  And as we get educated, we have to understand that education is pointless unless we use it.
[02:48:08.829 --> 02:48:10.510]  And we have to start using this education.
[02:48:10.730 --> 02:48:16.213]  And we have to start letting the government, the elite, the New World Order know that we're not going to go down without a fight.
[02:48:16.233 --> 02:48:21.135]  No matter what, no matter what the odds are, no matter what the consequences are, we're going to stand up.
[02:48:21.475 --> 02:48:28.139]  And we're going to be doing a protest outside Mayor Bloomberg's office, outside the mayor's office of film, next Monday.
[02:48:29.140 --> 02:48:30.662]  Uh, 4 o'clock, we're doing a protest.
[02:48:30.762 --> 02:48:31.743]  Next Monday, 4 o'clock.
[02:48:31.883 --> 02:48:33.065]  All the details are going to be on WeAreDemocrats.
[02:48:33.085 --> 02:48:37.770]  In front of the scum, in front of the scum's government office or his corporate office?
[02:48:38.190 --> 02:48:41.474]  His mayor's office of film and theater and broadcasting office.
[02:48:41.695 --> 02:48:43.657]  Okay, we'll have you back on Monday for that, Luke.
[02:48:49.039 --> 02:48:54.484]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.864 --> 02:49:02.511]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.197 --> 02:49:10.240]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.660 --> 02:49:22.085]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.385 --> 02:49:26.067]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.347 --> 02:49:28.288]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.608 --> 02:49:32.450]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:00.481 --> 02:51:05.405]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:05.605 --> 02:51:14.552]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[02:51:50.434 --> 02:52:08.360]  I'll be back Sunday, ladies and gentlemen, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:52:08.460 --> 02:52:08.860]  live.
[02:52:08.880 --> 02:52:17.783]  Hopefully re-energize heaven a little bit negative today, but talk of world depressions and police running around acting like scum everywhere.
[02:52:18.669 --> 02:52:20.591]  It's not just that I'm tired and I've been working too much.
[02:52:20.631 --> 02:52:21.672]  I'm just mad, man.
[02:52:21.692 --> 02:52:25.355]  I am just absolutely viciously angry.
[02:52:25.375 --> 02:52:28.457]  And I just hate that scumbag Bloomberg.
[02:52:28.698 --> 02:52:30.239]  And I hate Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:52:30.259 --> 02:52:37.365]  I mean, that punk piece of... that trollop, that little... that little... girly man's what he is.
[02:52:39.267 --> 02:52:46.373]  That gay porn star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who runs around acting tough all day, is a chicken neck piece of trash!
[02:52:47.205 --> 02:52:54.428]  With that stupid Nazi death's head he wears on the cover of Time Magazine, thinking we're all dumb and don't know what he is, you scumbag!
[02:52:54.448 --> 02:52:59.711]  Hitler killed 20 plus million people!
[02:53:01.731 --> 02:53:05.033]  Including millions and millions of Germans, you scum!
[02:53:06.213 --> 02:53:07.174]  You're scum!
[02:53:08.414 --> 02:53:11.876]  You're not a governor of California, you're a dirtbag piece of filth!
[02:53:16.690 --> 02:53:18.252]  I mean, look, I mean, we should be mad.
[02:53:18.292 --> 02:53:22.979]  That piece of trash gets up on the cover of Time Magazine wearing a Nazi belt buckle.
[02:53:24.721 --> 02:53:26.323]  I want him out of the country right now.
[02:53:26.363 --> 02:53:26.984]  He's a criminal.
[02:53:27.565 --> 02:53:28.346]  Anything else, Luke?
[02:53:28.787 --> 02:53:29.748]  Man, same here, man.
[02:53:29.808 --> 02:53:30.469]  I'm pissed off.
[02:53:30.942 --> 02:53:38.168]  Let's just concentrate on our efforts, let's get mad, and let's do something about it before it's too late, before we end up in concentration camps for God's sake.
[02:53:38.188 --> 02:53:39.028]  Let's do something.
[02:53:39.128 --> 02:53:40.830]  I want Arnold Schwarzenegger in prison.
[02:53:41.430 --> 02:53:48.496]  I want him in prison for all his Enron, and now Bush's new chief counsel's an Enron lawyer, the head of the Justice Department's an Enron lawyer.
[02:53:48.716 --> 02:53:50.337]  I'm tired of all these criminals!
[02:53:51.058 --> 02:53:51.939]  I'm just sick of them!
[02:53:51.979 --> 02:53:53.540]  I want to bring them to justice, man!
[02:53:54.338 --> 02:53:55.679]  And we got to bring them to justice.
[02:53:55.699 --> 02:53:57.539]  That or live in tyranny.
[02:53:57.599 --> 02:53:59.540]  Live in freedom or live in tyranny, man.
[02:53:59.560 --> 02:54:00.160]  We have a choice.
[02:54:00.180 --> 02:54:02.181]  We have to make the right choice before it's too late.
[02:54:02.421 --> 02:54:04.242]  And I'm telling you, time is of the essence.
[02:54:04.542 --> 02:54:12.845]  These people, these same people in charge, started World War II, World War I, the Great Depression, and they're going to do it again unless we stop them, unless we expose them.
[02:54:13.085 --> 02:54:14.826]  And it's up to us to take this country back.
[02:54:15.666 --> 02:54:18.388]  It's up to us to make a future for our children's children.
[02:54:18.708 --> 02:54:20.790]  And if we don't do it now, we can't do it never.
[02:54:20.830 --> 02:54:24.453]  So get out there, get active, and do something before it's too late.
[02:54:24.473 --> 02:54:25.634]  Do a Truth Squad.
[02:54:25.854 --> 02:54:26.795]  Do a street action.
[02:54:27.055 --> 02:54:30.177]  Give a DVD to a police officer or a military officer.
[02:54:30.237 --> 02:54:30.978]  Do something!
[02:54:33.963 --> 02:54:36.365]  I agree with you, man.
[02:54:36.465 --> 02:54:39.307]  I get down sometimes, but you gotta understand, you're on the right side.
[02:54:39.347 --> 02:54:40.527]  We are on the good fight.
[02:54:40.547 --> 02:54:41.688]  We are fighting the good fight.
[02:54:41.728 --> 02:54:44.630]  We are fighting evil, and we have to understand we can't get down.
[02:54:44.650 --> 02:54:48.072]  We have to keep our hopes up, because we can do anything we want.
[02:54:48.112 --> 02:54:48.873]  We are the people.
[02:54:49.113 --> 02:54:50.814]  We consent to the New World Order.
[02:54:50.854 --> 02:54:53.816]  We allow the New World Order to do what they want, because we don't do nothing about it.
[02:54:54.235 --> 02:54:57.037]  Let's understand it, let's get educated, and let's do something about it.
[02:54:57.057 --> 02:54:59.019]  I know, let's crush him, we're gonna crush him.
[02:54:59.339 --> 02:55:05.684]  I know we're gonna win, I just can't believe the hell this country and this world is gonna have to go through and I'm just so sick of all the scum.
[02:55:06.842 --> 02:55:08.884]  That serves this system and goes along with it.
[02:55:08.904 --> 02:55:10.305]  I can't believe what we've turned into.
[02:55:10.666 --> 02:55:21.254]  Luke, 4 o'clock Eastern, you're going to be at the film location, New York City Mayor's Office of Film, Theater, and Broadcasting, MOFTB, 1697 Broadway, 6th Floor, Edwards on 53rd Street.
[02:55:25.077 --> 02:55:31.903]  The phone number over there to let that filth know that we know they're criminals is 212-489-6710.
[02:55:32.163 --> 02:55:35.466]  How dare them tell Americans we can't video on the streets!
[02:55:36.047 --> 02:55:38.248]  And they go, don't worry, the police will be reasonable.
[02:55:38.529 --> 02:55:41.992]  That group of mafia you got working for you won't be reasonable.
[02:55:42.632 --> 02:55:45.875]  They're devil dogs that'll serve you as they breathe deadly poison.
[02:55:45.895 --> 02:55:46.736]  They love you.
[02:55:47.216 --> 02:55:48.197]  They love your evil.
[02:55:48.958 --> 02:55:52.621]  They love being treated like scum and killing this country.
[02:55:53.843 --> 02:55:55.524]  There's no doubt about the New York Police.
[02:55:55.564 --> 02:55:57.586]  They are the literal scum of Earth.
[02:55:58.327 --> 02:56:00.188]  Luke Radowsky, WeAreChange.org.
[02:56:00.208 --> 02:56:01.089]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[02:56:01.229 --> 02:56:02.009]  God bless you, brother.

[02:56:04.612 --> 02:56:06.713]  I want you to buy my videos and get them and make copies.
[02:56:06.813 --> 02:56:10.216]  If you've got somebody who's already bought them, get copies from them and make copies.
[02:56:10.276 --> 02:56:12.718]  You want to know something that's effective, you get Terror Storm.
[02:56:13.478 --> 02:56:15.520]  And you make 100 copies of it in the next month.
[02:56:15.580 --> 02:56:16.521]  It's a couple copies a day.
[02:56:17.279 --> 02:56:21.422]  And you get them out to people, and you expose these murder and trash, so we can bring them to justice.
[02:56:21.442 --> 02:56:23.624]  Alright, we'll see ya, see ya Sunday.
