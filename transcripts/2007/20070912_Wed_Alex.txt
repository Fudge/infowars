[00:00:05.493 --> 00:00:06.134]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:07.856]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.557 --> 00:00:09.699]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.161]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:13.404]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.464 --> 00:00:17.209]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.755]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.416 --> 00:00:27.997]  No, we fooled you again.
[00:00:28.177 --> 00:00:34.280]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Bob Dacey substituting for Alex Jones for the third day in a row.
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:52.408]  Seems like at the end of the last show, Alex called in and the poor boy, you know, they took his bullhorn away from him and everything, and so the poor boy's been screaming at the top of his lungs for three days or four or five days up in New York, and I think his voice finally gave out on him, and I think that he needs
[00:00:53.172 --> 00:00:54.573]  A well-deserved rest.
[00:00:54.673 --> 00:01:07.018]  So, at the end of the show, yesterday, they asked me if I'd come back in here and assume the chair here in the Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines.
[00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:09.098]  And so, I'm back!
[00:01:09.198 --> 00:01:11.199]  Bob Basie substituting for Alex Jones.
[00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:14.501]  You're going to have to put up with me for one more day.
[00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:20.303]  Again, if you're unfamiliar with who I am, Alex and I have been friends for
[00:01:21.465 --> 00:01:27.987]  About nine years, he's the guy that woke me up to the New World Order and what was going on.
[00:01:29.048 --> 00:01:36.270]  I have often said I thought the young man was nutty as a fruitcake until I looked into what he had to say.
[00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:45.693]  And despite the fact that Alex is boisterous and vociferous and loud, and sometimes you might even say a little obnoxious,
[00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:49.412]  The man tells the truth, and that's what matters.
[00:01:49.972 --> 00:01:58.195]  You know, Alex is always saying, it's not about me, it's about the message, it's about what's going on, it's about saving the country, and he's absolutely right.
[00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:08.238]  You know, over the years, I've had, you know, because people know that I know Alex, I've had a lot of people like to criticize Alex when they meet me.
[00:02:08.278 --> 00:02:09.538]  They say, you know Alex Jones?
[00:02:09.578 --> 00:02:12.019]  And they say, oh, he's too loud, or he's too whatever.
[00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:15.053]  I don't know.
[00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:45.132]  The real tip of the spear in the 9-1-1 Truth Movement, more than any other individual in the country, is because the man is telling the truth, and he backs up what he says.
[00:02:46.052 --> 00:02:53.634]  And so, you know, I hear that all the time from people, and they say, well, Bob, you know, I like the way you do it, because you don't yell and scream.
[00:02:53.894 --> 00:02:56.014]  I say, well, fine, wonderful, whatever.
[00:02:56.514 --> 00:02:58.435]  You know, my personality is kind of
[00:02:59.241 --> 00:03:00.362]  Calm, cool and collected.
[00:03:00.442 --> 00:03:03.123]  And Alex's personality is up there.
[00:03:03.484 --> 00:03:04.844]  He's on a different level.
[00:03:04.944 --> 00:03:07.366]  The man radiates energy everywhere he goes.
[00:03:08.246 --> 00:03:14.450]  And right now, hopefully he's sitting at home charging up his batteries to get going again tomorrow.
[00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:19.789]  So again, I'm based in Austin, Texas.
[00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:27.111]  I have a retail hardware store, a true value hardware store at Spicewood Springs Road and 183 in Austin.
[00:03:27.732 --> 00:03:33.153]  And so I sell hardware and other such things at my store, including Alex Jones videos.
[00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.894]  I've sold those for years.
[00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:48.295]  And, you know, for anybody in the Austin area, I also sell Ron Paul yard signs and some of his t-shirts at my cost because the idea about Ron Paul is to get the word out.
[00:03:48.675 --> 00:03:55.256]  It's kind of a neat thing, you know, to deliberately sell stuff at your cost so that you can just get the stuff out there.
[00:03:55.296 --> 00:04:00.257]  You know, I have vowed not to make a penny promoting Ron Paul.
[00:04:00.937 --> 00:04:01.877]  I just don't want to do it.
[00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:02.838]  It's not about the money.
[00:04:03.538 --> 00:04:04.518]  It's about the message.
[00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:11.959]  So anyway, if you're in the Austin area, you can stop by and pick up a Ron Paul yard sign for $2.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:20.409]  And while I'm in the announcement mode, I want to remind everyone that my TV show, The Simple Truth, which is here in Austin,
[00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.750]  I don't know.
[00:04:41.122 --> 00:04:46.005]  Alright, after the break we're going to get into some more stuff about some of the latest news.
[00:04:46.426 --> 00:04:50.688]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones on the GCN Communications Radio Network.
[00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:02.078]  Terrorism!
[00:05:02.238 --> 00:05:02.958]  Terrorism!
[00:05:03.098 --> 00:05:09.143]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:05:09.424 --> 00:05:11.005]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:05:11.265 --> 00:05:13.727]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:05:14.127 --> 00:05:28.699]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:29.059]  government.
[00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:31.021]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:37.303]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:05:37.444 --> 00:05:41.925]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[00:05:42.185 --> 00:05:47.528]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:05:47.688 --> 00:05:48.888]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:05:48.968 --> 00:05:49.328]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:05:49.548 --> 00:05:51.589]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:06:03.826 --> 00:06:09.308]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:17.292]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:17.992 --> 00:06:25.056]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.436 --> 00:06:36.862]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.182 --> 00:06:41.105]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:43.066]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.406 --> 00:06:47.248]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:06:47.848 --> 00:06:55.637]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.677 --> 00:06:57.039]  Each night when you sleep
[00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:08.340]  Your body uses the time to restore itself so that you could wake up feeling renewed.
[00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:11.241]  But wouldn't it be nice to also wake up looking younger?
[00:07:11.721 --> 00:07:19.384]  Now there's Night Skin, a serum that goes on while you sleep to reduce age spots, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and moisturize the skin.
[00:07:19.984 --> 00:07:26.572]  Night Skin was made by Dr. Arthur Perry, a board-certified cosmetic surgeon, as an alternative to some invasive surgeries.
[00:07:27.032 --> 00:07:34.501]  It has real ingredients that have been shown to reduce the signs of aging and fight natural sun damage, all while you get a good night's sleep.
[00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:40.202]  Try NightSkin today and see what it's like to wake up feeling renewed both inside and out.
[00:07:40.562 --> 00:07:43.023]  Try NightSkin risk-free by calling 1-800-894-3418.
[00:07:43.103 --> 00:07:48.244]  NightSkin is guaranteed to renew your skin overnight.
[00:07:48.504 --> 00:07:50.724]  Turning back the clock has never been this easy.
[00:07:51.084 --> 00:07:52.965]  Try NightSkin risk-free today.
[00:07:52.985 --> 00:07:53.405]  Call 1-800-894-3418.
[00:07:53.445 --> 00:07:53.805]  That's 1-800-894-3418.
[00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:10.383]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.403 --> 00:08:11.223]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.984 --> 00:08:12.844]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.544 --> 00:08:17.486]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.726 --> 00:08:21.868]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:32.892]  This is Bob Basie, substituting for Alex Jones here on the swath day of September 2007.
[00:08:35.775 --> 00:08:38.776]  And as I said before the break, we're going to be covering some news today.
[00:08:38.796 --> 00:08:44.118]  We're going to still talk more about 9-1-1 because we didn't get started yesterday.
[00:08:44.518 --> 00:08:47.520]  Before I do that, I've got a couple of other things I want to talk about.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:58.544]  Again, I'm a member of the John Birch Society and I pass out the literature and stuff at my store and we have a brand new pamphlet.
[00:08:59.344 --> 00:09:01.525]  If you're in the Austin area, you can come by and pick one up.
[00:09:01.625 --> 00:09:02.625]  It's a free pamphlet.
[00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:04.726]  It's about the North American Union.
[00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:10.642]  And I'm going to go through this pamphlet a little bit for those of you who aren't in the Austin area.
[00:09:10.682 --> 00:09:15.885]  If you're in the Austin area, go by my hardware store at Spotswood Springs Road and 183 and pick one up for free.
[00:09:17.106 --> 00:09:27.032]  However, if you're not in the Austin area, which is like the vast, vast majority of you listening, you can go to www.jbs.org slash NAU
[00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:34.803]  for North American Union and I'll bet you that you could order a whole bunch of these things and pass them out to all your friends and everybody and his brother.
[00:09:35.764 --> 00:09:47.353]  What's on the pamphlet, I wish this was television sometimes so I could show you, but we're talking about I pledge allegiance to the flag of the North American Union.
[00:09:48.834 --> 00:09:56.100]  Can you imagine combining the Canadian and Mexican flags with Old Glory and pledging allegiance to a North American Union, NAU?
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:05.267]  In reality, the NAU process is already underway to erase our borders and form a new nation by merging the US, Mexico, and Canada.
[00:10:06.408 --> 00:10:09.010]  Are the NAU planners out of their minds?
[00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:09.931]  No!
[00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:14.334]  They're dead serious and their words speak for themselves.
[00:10:14.795 --> 00:10:16.756]  Now, there are some quotes from some of these folks.
[00:10:17.156 --> 00:10:21.200]  Here's one from our imperious leader himself, George Bush.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.421]  He said this on March the 23rd, 2005.
[00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:37.115]  As to what kind of North American Union there might be, I see one based on free trade that will then entail commitment to markets and democracy, transparency, rule of law.
[00:10:37.835 --> 00:10:46.359]  There you have it, in his own words, which I've mangled a little bit, but I do that on my TV show, so I thought I would do that here on the radio.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.781]  You can see it's more than just an economic deal.
[00:10:51.713 --> 00:10:54.434]  Democracy, transparency, rule of law.
[00:10:54.534 --> 00:10:58.395]  What does that have to do with just, you know, selling bananas across the border or whatever?
[00:10:59.115 --> 00:11:00.575]  So you've got to watch out for these people.
[00:11:00.635 --> 00:11:01.895]  It's some really bad news.
[00:11:04.116 --> 00:11:06.137]  Part of that, of course, is the NAFTA Superhighway.
[00:11:07.997 --> 00:11:16.279]  And, of course, at the John Birch Society, the featured writer on that subject is the producer of the Simple Truth TV show that I host.
[00:11:17.217 --> 00:11:24.500]  One of the producers, Kelly Taylor, she is the number one writer at the John Birch Society of the New American on that subject.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:31.283]  And of course, we've been all over that subject, Jeff and Kelly and I, for years.
[00:11:31.943 --> 00:11:32.704]  Four years.
[00:11:32.844 --> 00:11:37.786]  We were among the very first people in the whole country to start saying what the Trans-Texas Corridor was.
[00:11:39.587 --> 00:11:45.389]  You know, just a chunk of a big NAFTA superhighway to link the United States, Canada and Mexico into one country.
[00:11:46.767 --> 00:11:48.708]  You know, you talk about the Amaro.
[00:11:49.789 --> 00:11:55.732]  Somebody said that there's supposed to be an Amaro coin out there that they've seen, and I don't know if that's true or not.
[00:11:55.932 --> 00:11:57.113]  I've seen a photograph of it.
[00:11:57.393 --> 00:12:02.056]  I don't know whether that's just some kind of a fake bogus thing or whether they're actually starting to make the dumb things.
[00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:03.557]  They say they came from the Denver Mint.
[00:12:04.317 --> 00:12:05.398]  I don't know if that's true or not.
[00:12:05.418 --> 00:12:09.640]  I'd have to have monster corroboration for that, because I'm a stickler for facts.
[00:12:10.461 --> 00:12:14.203]  And then, of course, you have wage and job loss, you know, associated with it.
[00:12:15.327 --> 00:12:17.849]  Our independence going into the can.
[00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:21.251]  And there's a few quotes here from some people here.
[00:12:21.291 --> 00:12:26.134]  This is the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Alan S. Binder.
[00:12:26.934 --> 00:12:37.281]  And he said, he conceded that NAU style free trade would quote, will put as many as 40 million American jobs at risk of being shipped out of the country in the next decade or two.
[00:12:37.681 --> 00:12:39.802]  He said that in the Wall Street Journal, March 28th, 2007.
[00:12:42.498 --> 00:13:04.446]  And of course, the former El Presidente de México, Vicente Fox, in May of 2002 said this, Eventually, our long-range objective is to establish with the United States, but also with Canada, our other regional partner, an ensemble of connections and institutions similar to those created by the European Union.
[00:13:05.486 --> 00:13:09.928]  Yeah, they kind of chastised him for his candor there, because he's been shooting his mouth off too much.
[00:13:10.628 --> 00:13:12.089]  And one of the things that I want to
[00:13:12.668 --> 00:13:26.545]  Point your attention to, in this brochure, is the NAFTA Secretariat's website, which is www.nafta-sec-alena.org.
[00:13:26.605 --> 00:13:30.029]  Let me repeat that, because you know, we don't say anything we can't back up.
[00:13:30.289 --> 00:13:30.810]  It's all true.
[00:13:31.893 --> 00:13:40.540]  www.NAFTA-SEC-ALENA.org.
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:54.810]  If you put that into your address box on your search engine, you will find the front page of the NAFTA Secretariat's website, and you will see their version of the three flags morphed into one.
[00:13:55.271 --> 00:14:00.895]  The United States flag, Mexican flag, and Canadian flag all morphed into one flag.
[00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:05.171]  And I'll tell you what, that makes me sick.
[00:14:05.351 --> 00:14:05.931]  It really does.
[00:14:07.251 --> 00:14:09.212]  North American leaders are planning a new nation.
[00:14:09.472 --> 00:14:10.612]  And what does it mean for you?
[00:14:11.172 --> 00:14:13.632]  Well, I guarantee you what it means for you is not good.
[00:14:14.112 --> 00:14:16.193]  So, you know, got a little time?
[00:14:16.233 --> 00:14:25.835]  Go to www.jbs.org slash NAU and order a whole bunch of these brochures and pass them out to everybody you know.
[00:14:27.572 --> 00:14:29.093]  I like the United States of America.
[00:14:29.213 --> 00:14:32.515]  You know, I don't believe in a post-national America.
[00:14:33.116 --> 00:14:43.002]  You know, that Christopher Hayes guy from the Puffin Writing Fellow at the Nation Institute when he was writing that trash article about there is no NAFTA superhighway in the works.
[00:14:43.642 --> 00:14:53.989]  You know, later on on C-SPAN, a few days ago, he was talking about all you hayseeds being worried about a lack of dialogue having to do with post-national America.
[00:14:55.539 --> 00:14:58.481]  No, I don't want there to be any dialogue about a post-national America.
[00:14:58.541 --> 00:15:01.703]  I like America as a nation, not as a post-nation.
[00:15:02.603 --> 00:15:11.449]  You know, so, order some of these brochures from www.JVS.org slash NAU and pass them out to everybody, your brother and your friends.
[00:15:11.489 --> 00:15:13.310]  They got a whole bunch of other stuff in there too.
[00:15:14.611 --> 00:15:21.016]  DVDs on the North American Union and on the way America is supposed to be and everything.
[00:15:21.056 --> 00:15:23.117]  Just go there and pig out, alright?
[00:15:23.897 --> 00:15:28.278]  Okay, I want to talk about some of the callers yesterday.
[00:15:28.939 --> 00:15:30.839]  I was so impressed.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.741]  I know Rush Limbaugh always likes to say how brilliant his callers are.
[00:15:37.461 --> 00:15:42.763]  Well, I tell you what, Alex Jones' callers are like on the ball.
[00:15:42.803 --> 00:15:44.403]  They know what's going on.
[00:15:44.563 --> 00:15:45.744]  I don't know everything.
[00:15:46.044 --> 00:15:49.765]  They're going to call me up and ask me questions and say, Bob, what do you think about this?
[00:15:50.165 --> 00:15:52.045]  I don't know everything.
[00:15:52.065 --> 00:15:53.606]  There's no time to know everything.
[00:15:54.292 --> 00:15:59.536]  You know, my main concentration the last few years has been the Napa Superhighway and the North American Union.
[00:16:00.296 --> 00:16:02.198]  But people ask me all these questions.
[00:16:03.079 --> 00:16:06.301]  These callers call up and they say things and I'm like, oh yeah, really?
[00:16:06.361 --> 00:16:06.921]  I didn't know that.
[00:16:07.382 --> 00:16:10.764]  Well, I want to review three of the callers yesterday.
[00:16:11.945 --> 00:16:22.393]  One of them called up and pointed out something that I hadn't seen before about the Montebello situation where the three
[00:16:23.955 --> 00:16:27.457]  Canadian policemen dressed up like protesters in order to start a riot.
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:41.168]  The accusation was, which was proven by videotape and by still photography, that these guys were cops and that they were carrying rocks.
[00:16:41.888 --> 00:16:50.194]  Well this one caller called up yesterday and said, well there's one of the many photographs that was taken of that is on a Canadian website www.cupe.ca
[00:16:56.452 --> 00:16:57.632]  That's a lot.
[00:16:57.712 --> 00:16:58.772]  That's a big mouthful.
[00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:01.173]  Look at all the photographs that somebody was taking.
[00:17:01.193 --> 00:17:04.114]  I'm going to repeat that again just, you know, in case you've got a pen.
[00:17:04.134 --> 00:17:07.174]  And there's all these pictures of what was going on there.
[00:17:07.194 --> 00:17:11.596]  And picture number 49 is the caller correctly identified.
[00:17:22.501 --> 00:17:31.223]  One of the cops who is being quote-unquote arrested by his fellow cops has a beer bottle in his right back pocket.
[00:17:34.263 --> 00:17:37.304]  You know, a beer bottle, you know, that's a good thing to start a riot with.
[00:17:37.344 --> 00:17:41.264]  I mean, there's no beer in it, you know, but there it is.
[00:17:41.284 --> 00:17:42.285]  I'm looking at it right now.
[00:17:42.325 --> 00:17:43.325]  You can see it plain as day.
[00:17:44.005 --> 00:17:50.366]  So not only did they have rocks in their hands, but they also had at least one beer bottle.
[00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:51.851]  Interesting.
[00:17:52.431 --> 00:17:55.314]  So once again, the caller was dead on, completely accurate.
[00:17:57.095 --> 00:18:00.939]  And then another caller called in about something I was unaware of.
[00:18:01.139 --> 00:18:04.282]  You know, like I say, I don't know everything.
[00:18:04.342 --> 00:18:16.833]  We were kind of bashing CFR members, and the caller called up and said, well, you know, there's this CFR member by the name of Dr. Haleh Esfandiari who was arrested in Iran.
[00:18:17.737 --> 00:18:25.564]  And she's a CFR member and another CFR member went and sprung her out of jail in Iran.
[00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:27.085]  And I'm going, well, I don't know about that.
[00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:29.247]  You know, we'll check out and see what he says.
[00:18:29.287 --> 00:18:30.328]  So I actually checked it out.
[00:18:31.128 --> 00:18:35.232]  Sure enough, I'm at Amnesty International's website.
[00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.095]  That's web.amnesty.org.
[00:18:39.815 --> 00:18:45.880]  And here's a little blurb about Dr. Holly Esfandiari, female, age 67,
[00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:50.231]  Academic Joint U.S.-Iranian National.
[00:18:50.271 --> 00:18:51.111]  She's a U.S.
[00:18:51.171 --> 00:18:52.972]  national and she's an Iranian national.
[00:18:52.992 --> 00:19:04.436]  It says here, U.S.-based academic Holly Esfandiari was detained on 8 May after being summoned for questioning by Ministry of Intelligence officials.
[00:19:04.596 --> 00:19:05.456]  That's in Iran.
[00:19:06.036 --> 00:19:13.639]  She's believed to be held without charge in Evin Prison Section 209, which is run by the Ministry of Intelligence.
[00:19:14.605 --> 00:19:19.326]  On 12 May, the newspaper Caihan accused her of spying for the U.S.
[00:19:19.366 --> 00:19:23.687]  and Israel, and of trying to incite a democratic revolution in the country.
[00:19:24.827 --> 00:19:30.389]  And it says that she is the head of the Middle East program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
[00:19:31.489 --> 00:19:33.790]  Now, that's true, and guess what?
[00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:35.350]  She is a CFR member.
[00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:39.831]  I looked it up, and the guy who broke her out of jail was Lee Hamilton.
[00:19:41.967 --> 00:19:44.310]  Same guy who was the Vice Chair of the 9-1-1 Commission.
[00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.592]  So, hey, go figure.
[00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:49.618]  CFR attacks our national security.
[00:19:50.118 --> 00:19:53.483]  Is it a stretch to think they would be attacking Iranian national security?
[00:19:53.743 --> 00:19:54.745]  Hmm, I don't think so.
[00:19:55.225 --> 00:19:56.627]  Be back in a few minutes after the break.
[00:19:56.727 --> 00:19:57.849]  Bob Dicey for Alex Jones.

[00:23:08.526 --> 00:23:09.887]  But the symptoms are there.

[00:24:13.983 --> 00:24:19.944]  Okay, Bob Basie, back on the Alex Jones Show this 12th day of September 2007.
[00:24:20.944 --> 00:24:22.725]  And once again, before the break.
[00:24:23.105 --> 00:24:24.985]  You know, I'm not used to breaks on my TV show.
[00:24:25.025 --> 00:24:27.165]  We just have to go a whole hour and there's no breaks.
[00:24:27.265 --> 00:24:29.706]  And so these breaks are kind of, you know, interesting.
[00:24:29.726 --> 00:24:30.766]  Actually, they're kind of nice.
[00:24:30.806 --> 00:24:32.026]  I get to relax for a few minutes.
[00:24:33.326 --> 00:24:41.808]  Before the break, we're talking about the accuracy and the fact that the callers that call in the Alex Jones Show are really on the ball.
[00:24:42.555 --> 00:25:03.433]  Another caller called in yesterday and we were talking about, I was talking about coincidence theory, about how in order to believe the official fairy tale about 9-1-1, you have to believe that coincidence after coincidence can be stacked on top of each other in order to make the official fairy tale believable.
[00:25:04.714 --> 00:25:05.915]  And we mentioned a few of them.
[00:25:06.075 --> 00:25:08.037]  Well, a caller called in and said,
[00:25:09.079 --> 00:25:15.222]  There was another coincidence that happened at the beginning of the first Gulf War, which was like 1990.
[00:25:15.303 --> 00:25:24.528]  He referred to a military exercise called Internal Look, and I'd never heard of that, you know, so I looked it up.
[00:25:25.028 --> 00:25:37.655]  I went to the website that, you know, specializes in all that military stuff, globalsecurity.org, and under the classification Military Operations Exercises CENTCOM,
[00:25:38.883 --> 00:25:43.444]  There is a operation that's called, an exercise called, Internal Look.
[00:25:44.865 --> 00:25:52.106]  And I want to read from what the history of Internal Look is in regard to Internal Look 90, which was 1990.
[00:25:53.567 --> 00:25:55.727]  A few excerpts from the paragraphs here.
[00:25:56.967 --> 00:26:06.150]  This was about right before Saddam Hussein's Iraqis invaded Kuwait and took over Kuwait.
[00:26:07.538 --> 00:26:09.159]  That's the historical context here.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:10.820]  U.S.
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:16.242]  Central Command, CENTCOM, and 3rd Army prudently anticipated the Gulf War crisis that occurred in 1990.
[00:26:16.362 --> 00:26:24.066]  Internal look showed Saudi Arabia could be defended against Iraqi invaders, but at great cost.
[00:26:25.247 --> 00:26:35.432]  As the exercise unfolded, the real-world movements of Iraq's air and ground forces eerily paralleled the scripted scenario of the war game.
[00:26:36.414 --> 00:26:47.379]  So closely did actual intelligence reports resemble the fictional exercise messages, the latter had to be prominently stamped, exercise only.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:57.104]  During the last few days of internal look, Saddam Hussein's forces invaded and captured Kuwait on 2 August 1990.
[00:26:58.464 --> 00:27:02.166]  So there you have yet another one of these wild coincidences.
[00:27:04.145 --> 00:27:13.115]  We just happened to be doing an exercise where Saddam invades Kuwait, and lo and behold, on the same day, Saddam invades Kuwait!
[00:27:13.235 --> 00:27:13.776]  Wow!
[00:27:13.876 --> 00:27:14.697]  Weren't we lucky!
[00:27:15.638 --> 00:27:20.643]  And you know, it's the same language of things that happened on September 11th.
[00:27:22.108 --> 00:27:31.817]  The real world hijackings, you know, taking place exactly at the same time that our military was running drills simulating the exact same scenario.
[00:27:31.997 --> 00:27:34.299]  You know, it's like, wow, what a coincidence.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:43.308]  And like I talked about yesterday, the 7-7 bombings in London, even more ridiculous.
[00:27:43.368 --> 00:27:46.811]  You've got an exercise going on simulating
[00:27:47.626 --> 00:27:58.710]  Bombing the London tube stations at the exact time and the exact place and the exact spots as the actual real-life bombings were taking place.
[00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.972]  I mean, you know, so the deal is you got to watch out for these drills.
[00:28:03.052 --> 00:28:03.672]  You really do.
[00:28:06.453 --> 00:28:12.595]  Okay, now another thing I wanted to touch on before I get into news, because we're going to cover a lot of news today.
[00:28:12.615 --> 00:28:13.856]  We didn't do that in the last couple of days.
[00:28:15.823 --> 00:28:41.616]  I, you know, in the last couple days we were talking about, um, TxDOT, the Texas Department of Transportation, and of course they're the ones that are trying to build the Trans-Texas Corridor, which is the first, uh, link, first, um, United States link, anyway, in the, um, NAFTA Superhighway, and therefore it's a national issue, international issue, just because of the geography of where Texas is.
[00:28:42.237 --> 00:28:44.598]  Well yeah, I was feeling, I was feeling pretty
[00:28:45.507 --> 00:28:46.167]  Good to go!
[00:29:03.758 --> 00:29:12.302]  It reveals that TxDOT is, while they're, while lying to the people of Texas, oh, we'll never toll your interstates, so we're only going to toll the new roads.
[00:29:12.802 --> 00:29:15.184]  You don't have to worry about tolling the interstates.
[00:29:15.244 --> 00:29:15.984]  Go back to sleep.
[00:29:16.484 --> 00:29:20.626]  We found out that they were proposing to do exactly the opposite of what they were saying.
[00:29:23.087 --> 00:29:29.650]  So, you know, that's what they proposed to do, and we found out they were lying, and we made a big story out of it, right?
[00:29:30.091 --> 00:29:32.652]  Well, when you get back from this break,
[00:29:33.399 --> 00:29:39.540]  We're going to talk about another document that I have discovered having to do with TxDOT.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:44.281]  So, this is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones, and I'll be back after the break.
[00:29:51.583 --> 00:29:52.563]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.983 --> 00:29:54.603]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.503 --> 00:29:58.224]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:01.325 --> 00:31:01.885]  Hey, Emily!

[00:31:06.347 --> 00:31:06.667]  Really?
[00:31:06.867 --> 00:31:07.307]  What is it?
[00:31:07.507 --> 00:31:07.987]  How does it work?
[00:31:08.187 --> 00:31:14.769]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[00:31:14.909 --> 00:31:17.210]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:22.712]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[00:31:23.052 --> 00:31:23.533]  That's it?
[00:31:23.713 --> 00:31:25.355]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[00:31:25.595 --> 00:31:26.316]  It is easy.
[00:31:26.516 --> 00:31:33.224]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:31:33.504 --> 00:31:35.026]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[00:31:35.346 --> 00:31:36.047]  That's amazing!
[00:31:36.468 --> 00:31:41.834]  And, the bentonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:31:42.114 --> 00:31:42.434]  Wow!
[00:31:42.654 --> 00:31:43.754]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[00:31:44.055 --> 00:31:46.875]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.

[00:32:01.471 --> 00:32:02.532]  Hey, Jack Blood here.
[00:32:02.753 --> 00:32:08.739]  I think that if we could see the germs potential biohazards all around us in our daily surroundings, we would turn into Howard Hughes.
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:13.264]  We try not to think about it primarily because we might think there's nothing we can do about it.
[00:32:13.565 --> 00:32:14.326]  Not so fast.
[00:32:14.406 --> 00:32:15.667]  Now there is a solution.
[00:32:15.847 --> 00:32:20.012]  I'm talking about Hazurid Complete Protection Kit, available now at Hazurid.com.

[00:32:48.363 --> 00:32:49.024]  H-A-Z-A-R-I-D, hazard.com.
[00:32:49.044 --> 00:32:50.225]  Tell them Jack Blood sent you.
[00:33:15.053 --> 00:33:26.384]  Alright, this is Bob Dasey back for Alex Jones and we're going to be continuing my little talk about a new document that I discovered, a TxDOTS document.
[00:33:27.254 --> 00:33:53.581]  Before the break, I was talking about how, well, you know, I was feeling pretty good that Kelly and I snuck into the, well, we didn't sneak in, we got admitted as credentialed reporters for the New American Magazine, but got into that transportation form and discovered this document where TxDOT has been lying to everybody all these years, telling us that they're not going to toll our interstate highways, they have no design on tolling existing highways.
[00:33:54.850 --> 00:34:02.141]  You know, we discovered the document, they're lying, we put it out, and it goes mainstream, and now Txot's got this huge, gigantic, black eye.
[00:34:02.933 --> 00:34:07.195]  Right when they're trying to con everybody into thinking the toll roads are so wonderful.
[00:34:07.535 --> 00:34:07.755]  You know?
[00:34:08.196 --> 00:34:09.196]  Everybody's mad at him now.
[00:34:09.256 --> 00:34:15.439]  Senator Hutchison has introduced a bill to stop that process from ever happening in the whole United States.
[00:34:15.539 --> 00:34:20.461]  And I'm just, you know, I'm tickled pink that we were the ones that kind of shot the torpedo at him, you know?
[00:34:20.962 --> 00:34:23.083]  And it blew, and it hit the target.
[00:34:23.163 --> 00:34:30.206]  It blew up and it's caused massive damage to TxDOT and therefore causing massive damage, massive damage
[00:34:30.996 --> 00:34:33.738]  To the Trans-Texas Corridor and the NAFTA Superhighway.
[00:34:33.778 --> 00:34:35.600]  We're just tickled pink about it, you know?
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:41.164]  But, all this stuff is out there and there's so much stuff to find.
[00:34:41.885 --> 00:34:44.507]  I discovered a document the other day, an old one.
[00:34:46.709 --> 00:34:49.371]  It's four and a half years old, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:49.851 --> 00:34:53.134]  This is a text doc paper.
[00:34:54.715 --> 00:34:58.318]  It looks like it's addressed to the first session of the 108th Congress, so it's old.
[00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:05.814]  Texas Transportation Priorities Strategy Tolling Interstate Routes.
[00:35:06.214 --> 00:35:12.359]  This thing has a January the 29th 2003 date on it.
[00:35:12.739 --> 00:35:28.432]  This thing's been sitting around floating around all this time you know out there in cyberspace on the internet and nobody ever found it and nobody ever publicized it and you know so now the fact that we found another one
[00:35:29.607 --> 00:35:33.868]  Four and a half years later, gee, maybe we're not so smart after all, huh?
[00:35:35.268 --> 00:35:38.229]  Which makes the mainstream media even dumber than us, right?
[00:35:38.669 --> 00:35:43.150]  I want to read from this document, Strategy Tolling Interstate Routes.
[00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:56.592]  While the states have not successfully pursued the Interstate Tolling Authority provided in Section 1216B for a variety of reasons, including political opposition from those who would ultimately pay the tolls,
[00:35:57.466 --> 00:36:01.210]  We in Texas would like to see it continue as an option for states.
[00:36:03.392 --> 00:36:13.142]  And then later on in the document it said, under the heading, Buying Back Portions of Interstate to Allow Tolling, it says,
[00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:20.413]  Texas would like to pursue this option in the development of the Trans-Texas Corridor and other needed improvements.
[00:36:20.973 --> 00:36:27.837]  Congressional efforts to make this option as easily accessible as possible will greatly assist our future endeavors.
[00:36:28.517 --> 00:36:29.097]  Ha, yeah.
[00:36:29.518 --> 00:36:31.178]  Okay, so there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:31.198 --> 00:36:40.143]  Back in 2003, early 2003, TxDOT's asking the federal government to let them toll existing interstate highways
[00:36:40.803 --> 00:36:43.164]  To fund the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:36:43.604 --> 00:36:44.145]  Wow!
[00:36:44.425 --> 00:36:47.526]  Just like we've been saying all this time and we're right again.
[00:36:49.147 --> 00:36:54.950]  Later on in this little document it says, it's got a TxDOT logo on it too, Texas Department of Transportation.
[00:36:55.750 --> 00:37:04.374]  We believe that states should be given the option to toll their interstates without the requirement of reimbursement of long ago federal funding.
[00:37:05.231 --> 00:37:12.573]  So that we can improve and maintain the interstates to meet the mobility and access needs of our citizens and business communities.
[00:37:13.173 --> 00:37:21.154]  So back in 2003, they didn't even want to pay the Feds for the portion of the highways that they were gonna buy back.
[00:37:21.674 --> 00:37:23.195]  They just wanted to take them, you know?
[00:37:23.575 --> 00:37:24.675]  Be cheaper that way, you know?
[00:37:24.955 --> 00:37:33.477]  Why pay the Feds back for something they spent money on a long time ago when we can just take the roads back without having to do it and slap tolls on them that way, you see?
[00:37:34.207 --> 00:37:56.284]  So once again, although like I say, I'm pleased that we were able to release the document just a few months ago, this one predates it by four and a half years, which proves that TextDot's lying has been long, long, long term.
[00:37:57.156 --> 00:38:02.461]  Okay, they didn't just come up with this plan like maybe they changed their minds and forgot to tell us.
[00:38:03.041 --> 00:38:11.689]  No, they've been planning on tattooing the people of Texas by tolling their interstate routes for a long, long time.
[00:38:12.249 --> 00:38:22.838]  So, hey, TxDOT, there's another black eye for you, courtesy of the alternative media, as you try to shove this trans-Texas corridor down our throats.
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:24.840]  Alright.
[00:38:28.616 --> 00:38:30.457]  Okay, now I got news.
[00:38:30.497 --> 00:38:30.997]  We got news.
[00:38:31.037 --> 00:38:34.119]  We haven't covered any news really in the last couple of days.
[00:38:34.159 --> 00:38:43.063]  We've been so busy on September 11th and on the Trans-Texas Corridor and after Superhighway stuff that we haven't really covered any news.
[00:38:43.123 --> 00:38:45.244]  So Alex likes to cover news.
[00:38:45.464 --> 00:38:47.125]  So what the heck, we're going to cover some news.
[00:38:49.506 --> 00:38:54.728]  We do something on Simple Truth quite regularly called Police State Alert.
[00:38:55.689 --> 00:38:58.190]  And what we do is we, because it's TV, we have a
[00:38:59.485 --> 00:39:04.529]  Lenny Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, where a bunch of Nazis are marching down the road, goose stepping.
[00:39:06.251 --> 00:39:11.395]  And then we play music to that, which is Rammstein's We're All Living in America.
[00:39:11.415 --> 00:39:15.418]  And we have that as our intro to Police State Alert.
[00:39:16.179 --> 00:39:17.780]  But this is radio, so forget that.
[00:39:19.942 --> 00:39:22.203]  Here's one, Police State Alert.
[00:39:23.144 --> 00:39:26.487]  This is from msnbc.com, Union City, Georgia.
[00:39:27.444 --> 00:39:30.125]  Salt lands McDonald's employee in jail.
[00:39:31.626 --> 00:39:34.427]  Police officer says over salted meat made him sick.
[00:39:34.987 --> 00:39:36.987]  Worker faces charges.
[00:39:38.748 --> 00:39:50.332]  A McDonald's employee, this is an AP article by the way, a McDonald's employee spent a night in jail and is facing criminal charges because a police officer's burger was too salty.
[00:39:50.872 --> 00:39:52.933]  So salty he says that it made him sick.
[00:39:53.893 --> 00:39:55.594]  Kendra Bull was arrested Friday.
[00:39:56.425 --> 00:40:01.930]  Charged with misdemeanor reckless conduct and freed on a thousand dollars bail.
[00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:11.918]  Bull, 20, said she accidentally spilled salt on hamburger meat and told her supervisor and a co-worker who tried to thump the salt off.
[00:40:13.839 --> 00:40:16.301]  On her break she ate a burger made with the salty meat.
[00:40:16.481 --> 00:40:20.404]  It didn't make me sick, Bull told the Atlanta Journal and Constitution.
[00:40:21.705 --> 00:40:22.146]  But then
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:32.188]  Police officer Wendell Adams got a burger made with the over-salted meat and he returned a short time later and told the manager it made him sick.
[00:40:33.549 --> 00:40:38.594]  Bull admitted spilling salt on the meat and Adams took her aside and questioned her, she said.
[00:40:39.715 --> 00:40:46.581]  If it was too salty, why did he not take one bite and throw it away, said Bull, who has worked at the restaurant for five months.
[00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:53.181]  She said she didn't know a police officer got one of the salty burgers because she couldn't see the drive-thru window from her work area.
[00:40:54.321 --> 00:41:00.745]  Police sent samples of the burger to the State Crime Lab for tests.
[00:41:02.926 --> 00:41:16.153]  City Public Information Officer George Louth said Bull was charged because she served the burger, quote, without regards to the well-being of anyone who might consume it, end quote.
[00:41:19.099 --> 00:41:20.659]  That's pretty pathetic.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.060]  That is pretty sad.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:32.562]  But that's what happens sometimes when you have, you know, when the police go wild, they arrest you for over-assaulting their hamburger by accident and throw you in jail.
[00:41:32.722 --> 00:41:34.162]  You see, that's not right.
[00:41:34.182 --> 00:41:34.922]  That's not America.
[00:41:34.962 --> 00:41:38.803]  That's why we call this, on our show in Austin, we call that police stay alert.
[00:41:39.684 --> 00:41:40.264]  Now here's one.
[00:41:41.884 --> 00:41:43.984]  This is from the Portland Tribune.
[00:41:45.365 --> 00:41:46.265]  This is more serious.
[00:41:47.512 --> 00:41:49.092]  Jail Worker Investigated.
[00:41:49.112 --> 00:41:51.853]  This is by Nick Budnick, Portland Tribune.
[00:41:54.794 --> 00:42:11.277]  Multnomah County Sheriff's Office investigators are scrutinizing a corrections officer at the downtown jail for internet postings made from his work computer in which he gloats about how fun it is to taser people and brags about having crushed one inmate's eye socket.
[00:42:13.718 --> 00:42:15.878]  David B. Thompson, 30, recently wrote
[00:42:16.937 --> 00:42:22.502]  On an internet message board that one of the more pleasurable parts of his job is when he gets to use his taser.
[00:42:23.283 --> 00:42:29.408]  Thus exposing people to the agonizing sensation of 50,000 volts of electricity pulsing through their bodies.
[00:42:30.189 --> 00:42:34.913]  Quote, seeing someone get tasered is second only to being the guy pulling the trigger.
[00:42:35.313 --> 00:42:35.754]  End quote.
[00:42:36.314 --> 00:42:39.837]  Thompson wrote on an internet message board August the 25th.
[00:42:41.338 --> 00:42:42.139]  That is money.
[00:42:42.199 --> 00:42:43.981]  Puts a smile on your face.
[00:42:44.927 --> 00:42:54.253]  So, here you have a policeman just having his jollies, zapping people with a taser in the United States of America.
[00:42:54.273 --> 00:43:01.658]  Of course, now that this is all out there, there's a big stink about it, and, you know, zero tolerance, and he's gotten in all kinds of trouble.
[00:43:01.718 --> 00:43:09.483]  But, you know, what kind of people are they hiring to be our law enforcement officers today?
[00:43:09.583 --> 00:43:10.944]  They used to be called peace officers.
[00:43:10.984 --> 00:43:13.145]  Now they're called law enforcement officers.
[00:43:15.234 --> 00:43:16.495]  Okay, now here's this.
[00:43:16.775 --> 00:43:21.877]  This is related to what I would consider to be a police state alert.
[00:43:22.518 --> 00:43:24.919]  This is out of the American Statesman the other day.
[00:43:25.659 --> 00:43:28.080]  Associated Press by Todd Lewin.
[00:43:29.381 --> 00:43:34.043]  Animal tests link cancer implanted microchips.
[00:43:35.464 --> 00:43:39.766]  Findings weren't disclosed when FDA gave OK for humans.
[00:43:40.862 --> 00:43:43.663]  Oh, you mean when they want to... Wait a minute.
[00:43:43.703 --> 00:43:49.705]  That means when we take the chip, when they force us to take the chip, they may be forcing us to get cancer.
[00:43:49.765 --> 00:43:51.105]  Apparently this is what this says.
[00:43:51.145 --> 00:43:54.186]  Let me read a couple of paragraphs from this article.
[00:43:55.706 --> 00:44:08.330]  When the Food and Drug Administration approved implanting microchips in humans, the manufacturer said it would save lives, letting doctors scan the tiny transponders to access patients' medical records almost instantly.
[00:44:09.238 --> 00:44:21.326]  The FDA found, quote, reasonable assurance, end quote, that the device was safe, and a sub-agency even called it one of 2005's top, quote, innovative technologies, end quote.
[00:44:21.967 --> 00:44:23.147]  Ooh, neat, I want me one.
[00:44:23.287 --> 00:44:26.069]  Ooh, boy, if it's innovative and everything, I gotta have me one.
[00:44:26.229 --> 00:44:26.770]  Me first.
[00:44:28.511 --> 00:44:29.291]  Now, back to the article.
[00:44:29.311 --> 00:44:33.214]  But neither the company nor the regulators publicly mentioned this.
[00:44:34.715 --> 00:44:37.417]  A series of veterinary and toxicology studies
[00:44:38.052 --> 00:44:48.615]  Dating back to the mid-1990s, it's stated that the chip implants had induced malignant tumors in some lab mice and rats.
[00:44:50.935 --> 00:44:52.135]  And I say, oops!
[00:44:54.756 --> 00:45:05.498]  The transponders were the cause of the tumors, said Keith Johnson, a retired toxicologic pathologist, explaining the findings of a 1996 study he led.
[00:45:06.779 --> 00:45:07.559]  Well, how about that?
[00:45:08.726 --> 00:45:16.553]  So, they didn't tell you that this stuff, these little microchips can cause cancer?
[00:45:17.674 --> 00:45:18.094]  Wow!
[00:45:19.655 --> 00:45:21.757]  Well, you know, who cares?
[00:45:21.777 --> 00:45:23.739]  You're just a lab rat to these people anyway.
[00:45:23.819 --> 00:45:26.421]  So, go ahead and take your chip.
[00:45:26.501 --> 00:45:28.563]  You know, you'll be cool.
[00:45:28.603 --> 00:45:31.125]  You'll be one of the first people on the block to take the chip.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:42.423]  And they'll be able to track and trace you, but it'll be really cool when you walk into the Walmart and just walk out the front door with all your goodies and they've already scanned your body and already billed you and everything.
[00:45:42.723 --> 00:45:43.824]  You'll be so cool.
[00:45:44.784 --> 00:45:46.444]  Coolest slave in town.
[00:45:48.225 --> 00:45:50.466]  Okay, now, here's another one.
[00:45:50.586 --> 00:45:51.486]  Police State Alert.
[00:45:52.386 --> 00:45:54.827]  This is from the American Statesman, our local rag.
[00:45:56.087 --> 00:45:57.108]  September the 7th.
[00:45:57.768 --> 00:45:58.828]  This is the front page.
[00:45:59.828 --> 00:46:01.569]  Under the topic Constitutional Law.
[00:46:02.864 --> 00:46:04.605]  Part of Patriot Act voided.
[00:46:05.205 --> 00:46:05.545]  Whoa!
[00:46:05.665 --> 00:46:06.406]  That's good news.
[00:46:07.366 --> 00:46:11.688]  Judge orders FBI to stop using warrantless data seizure tactic.
[00:46:12.388 --> 00:46:14.049]  A Dan Egan Washington Post.
[00:46:15.169 --> 00:46:23.153]  A federal judge struck down controversial portions of the USA Patriot Act in a ruling that declared them unconstitutional Thursday.
[00:46:24.162 --> 00:46:34.507]  Ordering the FBI to stop its wide use of a warrantless method of obtaining email and telephone data from private companies for counter terrorism investigations.
[00:46:35.047 --> 00:46:36.128]  Now, you know, that's really good.
[00:46:36.468 --> 00:46:39.449]  I'm very pleased that part of the Patriot Act was voided.
[00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:43.652]  I'd be a lot more pleased if the whole Patriot Act was voided.
[00:46:44.632 --> 00:46:46.493]  The thing is huge.
[00:46:46.653 --> 00:46:48.674]  I mean, it's been a while since I looked at it, but it's like
[00:46:50.091 --> 00:46:54.212]  Humongous numbers of pages long, and it was obviously written before September 11th.
[00:46:55.152 --> 00:47:05.014]  And in a major, another one of those major coincidences, I mean, these people, they just, these super rich elite control freaks, they live by coincidence.
[00:47:05.094 --> 00:47:06.134]  They don't plan anything.
[00:47:06.334 --> 00:47:14.276]  They just, what they do is they scheme, and then they just hope some coincidence will come along to allow them to implement their scheme.
[00:47:14.356 --> 00:47:17.277]  I mean, it's just, how they get away with that is amazing.
[00:47:18.846 --> 00:47:24.348]  But, you know, they had the thing written before September 11th, and then September 11th happens, and then, hey!
[00:47:25.408 --> 00:47:33.952]  Now that September 11th has happened, and that crazy Osama Bin Laden has attacked America, hey, we can implement our Patriot Act on people!
[00:47:34.452 --> 00:47:36.152]  Gee, how lucky can we get?
[00:47:36.953 --> 00:47:47.997]  So they did, and Congress, you know, dutifully rolled over and didn't read the thing, and let them pass it, or past it, and of course, lo and behold, the whole thing is a
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:53.121]  Nothing but a 2,000 page Bill of Rights trasher, you know?
[00:47:55.022 --> 00:48:02.863]  If any of you want to doubt how horrible the Patriot Act is, if you... I mean, how could anything that's called the Patriot Act be horrible?
[00:48:02.943 --> 00:48:11.125]  I mean, right there, I mean, you know, a few people that like to watch TV all the time, football, and, you know, watch American Idol, and that's all your whole life.
[00:48:13.586 --> 00:48:16.767]  How could anything called the Patriot Act be anything but good?
[00:48:16.787 --> 00:48:17.687]  It says Patriot in it.
[00:48:18.627 --> 00:48:34.534]  Well, if you get up off your duffs and go to the computer and type in USA Patriot Act and go to Section 213, which is my favorite section because it's the most easy to comprehend even if you're a couch potato.
[00:48:34.594 --> 00:48:40.016]  Section 213 is only two paragraphs long and it blows away the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.
[00:48:40.737 --> 00:48:47.960]  The Fourth Amendment, you have to have reasonable cause to search and seize something and you've got to go to a judge and get a warrant.
[00:48:49.358 --> 00:48:56.864]  You know, that part of the Supreme Law of the land, which has been in effect in the United States since the adoption of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights?
[00:48:57.124 --> 00:48:57.965]  You know, that thing?
[00:48:58.505 --> 00:49:01.648]  You know, that's a law that's supposed to sit on top of all other law?
[00:49:02.409 --> 00:49:07.653]  Well, Section 213 of the Patriot Act says, we don't need no stinkin' warrant!
[00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:09.340]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.581]  That's exactly what it says.
[00:49:10.921 --> 00:49:15.844]  And it doesn't even say, we don't need no stinking warrant for terrorists.
[00:49:16.365 --> 00:49:19.887]  It says, we don't need no stinking warrant for any U.S.
[00:49:19.947 --> 00:49:20.188]  law.
[00:49:21.048 --> 00:49:22.029]  Go look it up yourself.
[00:49:22.089 --> 00:49:23.950]  Section 213, USA Patriot Act.
[00:49:25.472 --> 00:49:26.032]  Vile.
[00:49:26.993 --> 00:49:27.653]  Un-American.
[00:49:27.833 --> 00:49:28.654]  Disgusting.
[00:49:29.555 --> 00:49:31.176]  And the law.
[00:49:31.956 --> 00:49:36.760]  So I would be real happy if not part of the Patriot Act was voided,
[00:49:37.668 --> 00:49:43.671]  But if all of the worthless thing was thrown in the trash, because it is illegal.
[00:49:44.051 --> 00:49:50.174]  You know, you have a law that's illegal because it purports to trump the Bill of Rights.
[00:49:51.134 --> 00:49:55.676]  And a law that purports to trump the Bill of Rights is illegal.
[00:49:56.476 --> 00:49:57.617]  It's by definition.
[00:49:58.457 --> 00:50:00.398]  You know, there's no question about it.
[00:50:00.578 --> 00:50:06.521]  A law that purports to trump the Supreme Law.
[00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:08.670]  Is known void.
[00:50:08.951 --> 00:50:11.772]  But these fools run around enforcing it all the time.
[00:50:11.792 --> 00:50:18.715]  And now you... Here it is, 2007, six years later, some judge decides that this part of it isn't any good.
[00:50:21.116 --> 00:50:29.080]  You know, we said it back when they passed that stupid thing, that, oh, don't worry, the Supreme Court's going to get rid of it one of these days.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:35.243]  And we said, yeah, but before they do, if they do, it's going to be enforced all over the country.
[00:50:35.924 --> 00:50:36.484]  And guess what?
[00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:38.102]  That ain't right!
[00:50:40.123 --> 00:50:48.289]  Okay, well we're coming up to another break and we'll be back in a few minutes and we're going to continue with the news and I guess we'll continue with our Police State Alert.
[00:50:48.569 --> 00:50:52.232]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones on the Alex Jones Show on the GCN Network.
[00:51:04.429 --> 00:51:09.873]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.253 --> 00:51:17.858]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:25.634]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.034 --> 00:51:37.460]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.242]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.723 --> 00:51:43.684]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.984 --> 00:51:47.826]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.187 --> 00:52:01.967]  Terrorism!
[00:52:02.107 --> 00:52:02.848]  Terrorism!
[00:52:02.968 --> 00:52:09.031]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallouts, biological attacks, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:52:09.271 --> 00:52:10.872]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:52:11.132 --> 00:52:13.573]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:52:13.973 --> 00:52:28.560]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:28.920]  government.
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.881]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:52:31.241 --> 00:52:37.163]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:52:37.283 --> 00:52:41.785]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:53:01.886 --> 00:53:02.206]  I think so.
[00:53:16.946 --> 00:53:17.426]  I think so.
[00:53:42.122 --> 00:53:42.462]  I think so.
[00:54:16.536 --> 00:54:21.521]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:54:24.724 --> 00:54:26.966]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[00:54:27.586 --> 00:54:28.927]  Someone who cares.
[00:54:28.967 --> 00:54:29.528]  Your own
[00:54:34.184 --> 00:54:40.986]  Alright, we've got a little Johnny Cash there going on here.
[00:54:41.386 --> 00:55:02.633]  And in this last segment of the first hour of the Alex Jones Show on September 12, 2007, once again this is Bob Dacey sitting in for the inevitable Alex Jones as he rests his voice and his body from his monumental weekend that he's had up in New York.
[00:55:03.627 --> 00:55:06.950]  I was continuing, I was talking about my police state alerts here.
[00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.412]  I have another story that relates to police state alerts.
[00:55:09.432 --> 00:55:13.255]  This is out of the American Statesman, Austin American Statesman on the 9th.
[00:55:13.536 --> 00:55:14.677]  Again, front page news.
[00:55:16.418 --> 00:55:18.820]  FBI net reached beyond targets.
[00:55:20.181 --> 00:55:24.505]  Okay, it says Bureau also collected phone data on suspects associates.
[00:55:24.625 --> 00:55:25.226]  So here we go.
[00:55:25.686 --> 00:55:29.069]  This is Eric Lichtlau of the New York Times.
[00:55:30.479 --> 00:55:39.301]  In Washington, the FBI's terrorism investigations cast a much wider net than the agency has previously acknowledged.
[00:55:39.861 --> 00:55:51.423]  Newly obtained bureau records show that it relied on telecommunications companies to analyze phone calling patterns of the associates of Americans who had come under suspicion.
[00:55:52.583 --> 00:55:59.905]  The documents indicate that the FBI used secret demands for records to obtain data not only on people it considered targets,
[00:56:00.717 --> 00:56:12.120]  But also on the network of people that targets in turn were in contact with known as their quote, community of interest.
[00:56:14.401 --> 00:56:22.883]  And later in the article says the concepts proponents in the government consider it a vital tool in preventing attacks.
[00:56:24.144 --> 00:56:24.544]  Okay.
[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:26.861]  Yeah, another vital tool.
[00:56:26.901 --> 00:56:28.743]  You know, forget the fact that it's illegal.
[00:56:28.803 --> 00:56:29.223]  Who cares?
[00:56:29.283 --> 00:56:30.825]  It's a good tool, so let's use it.
[00:56:33.207 --> 00:56:40.193]  Typically, community of interest data might include an analysis of which people the targets called most frequently.
[00:56:41.154 --> 00:56:50.863]  So, I guess what that means, if you are the pizza parlor that these people call up all the time to order their pepperoni pizza with extra sausage and cheese,
[00:56:51.807 --> 00:56:57.311]  You could be a target of the FBI because they called you a lot.
[00:56:57.431 --> 00:56:57.571]  Hmm?
[00:56:57.591 --> 00:57:02.875]  The FBI declined to say exactly what information had been turned over.
[00:57:03.876 --> 00:57:13.983]  The boilerplate language suggests that the requests might have been used in many of more than 700 emergency or exigent national security letters.
[00:57:15.504 --> 00:57:18.546]  FBI spokesman Mike Corcan said Saturday that quote
[00:57:19.466 --> 00:57:32.410]  It is important to emphasize that it is no longer being used pending the development of an appropriate oversight and approval policy was used infrequently and never was used for email communications.
[00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:34.871]  So, there's their apology.
[00:57:35.751 --> 00:57:37.712]  See, we're sorry we broke the law, okay?
[00:57:38.392 --> 00:57:41.213]  We're sorry, and we're not using it anymore now that we got caught.
[00:57:41.993 --> 00:57:43.073]  We're not sorry we broke the law.
[00:57:43.413 --> 00:57:45.014]  We're sorry that we got caught.
[00:57:46.254 --> 00:57:48.595]  And later on in the article,
[00:57:49.494 --> 00:57:58.779]  Says, this is a quote from Marsha Hoffman, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which provided the records to the Times.
[00:57:59.299 --> 00:58:06.163]  Says, this whole concept of tracking someone's community of interest is not part of any established FBI authority.
[00:58:07.535 --> 00:58:18.179]  It's being defined by the FBI, and when it's left up to the FBI to decide what information is relevant to their investigations, they can vacuum up almost anything they want.
[00:58:19.219 --> 00:58:20.719]  Yeah, that's pathetic, y'all.
[00:58:20.799 --> 00:58:26.321]  I mean, you know, our FBI is watching us breaking the law, you name it, breaking the Constitution, they don't care.
[00:58:26.341 --> 00:58:30.963]  Alright, we're coming up on the top of the hour break.
[00:58:31.003 --> 00:58:32.583]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones.
[00:58:32.663 --> 00:58:33.404]  Be back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:41.033 --> 00:58:45.626]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.111 --> 00:58:57.752]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.413 --> 00:58:59.474]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.195 --> 00:59:01.296]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.957 --> 00:59:02.758]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.519 --> 00:59:04.400]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:08.845]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.286 --> 00:59:13.351]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.004 --> 00:59:21.527]  Welcome back to the second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:21.587 --> 00:59:28.133]  Once again, sorry to disappoint you, this is Bob Basie sitting in for Alex Jones while he rests his body in his throat.
[00:59:29.174 --> 00:59:32.817]  And before the break, we were talking about the FBI.
[00:59:34.138 --> 00:59:42.185]  Gee, they've been going after a suspect's community of interest, you know, without any warrant or anything.
[00:59:42.205 --> 00:59:43.927]  They just want to go snooping everybody's business.
[00:59:44.865 --> 01:00:13.748]  and uh... they got caught doing it and so we're not doing it right now so shut up you know uh... you know it kind of reminds me of this article you know they want to go after uh... not just the person they suspect but whoever this person they suspect is talking to uh... including the pizza delivery guy I guess but it kind of reminds me of six degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon remember that thing where you could take six degrees and somehow you could be linked to Kevin Bacon I kind of wonder about that like for example
[01:00:14.415 --> 01:00:21.037]  Let's say, sometime, the FBI got tired of Mel Gibson running around doing patriotic things, okay?
[01:00:21.057 --> 01:00:24.678]  So they want to investigate suspicious Mel Gibson, right?
[01:00:25.598 --> 01:00:33.620]  Well, Mel Gibson knows, um... Well, Mel Gibson's dad, Hutton Gibson, knows Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.621 --> 01:00:34.861]  Right?
[01:00:35.521 --> 01:00:36.021]  Y'all know that.
[01:00:36.381 --> 01:00:36.681]  Okay.
[01:00:36.761 --> 01:00:38.202]  Well, Alex Jones knows me.
[01:00:39.082 --> 01:00:39.242]  So!
[01:00:40.126 --> 01:00:46.807]  With just a couple of degrees of separation, if they wanted to investigate Mel Gibson, they could go after me, couldn't they?
[01:00:47.788 --> 01:00:49.188]  You know, that's that Kevin Bacon thing.
[01:00:49.428 --> 01:00:51.488]  You know, these people are pathetic.
[01:00:51.689 --> 01:00:55.109]  You know, the FBI is supposed to be, you know, the good guys.
[01:00:56.229 --> 01:01:01.451]  And when it comes to the, and they are the good guys, when it comes to the vast majority of them, they do a great job.
[01:01:03.311 --> 01:01:07.692]  But when you get up there at the top, when they start to get that political stuff going on there, and they start
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:15.092]  You know, whenever anybody is going to, you know, tweak the nose of the elites, boy, those guys up at the top, they put the kibosh on that.
[01:01:16.013 --> 01:01:17.295]  And, you know, they ought to know better.
[01:01:17.516 --> 01:01:20.300]  They're supposed to be, you know, they're supposed to protect the Constitution.
[01:01:20.761 --> 01:01:21.743]  They swear enough to do it.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.482]  And then when some elite tells them, well, you know, why don't we go spy on these people without a warrant?
[01:01:26.542 --> 01:01:28.322]  And why don't we do all this Patriot Act stuff?
[01:01:28.342 --> 01:01:29.823]  They just sit there and do it anyway.
[01:01:30.003 --> 01:01:37.126]  And therefore, you know, it's a, it's a part of the police state alert scenario that we always talk about on our local TV show.
[01:01:38.346 --> 01:01:38.866]  Being a witch.
[01:01:41.487 --> 01:01:47.089]  President Bush, I don't know if Alex has talked about this yet, but his people handed this to me.
[01:01:47.169 --> 01:01:49.670]  So I guess maybe, maybe it hadn't been covered.
[01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:50.011]  I don't know.
[01:01:51.656 --> 01:02:04.208]  Early August, our imperious leader released an executive order blocking property of persons undermining the sovereignty of Lebanon or its democratic processes and institutions.
[01:02:05.129 --> 01:02:09.734]  Yeah, as if the United States gives a rat's behind about the Lebanese.
[01:02:09.854 --> 01:02:10.254]  Come on.
[01:02:10.535 --> 01:02:11.055]  Give me a break.
[01:02:13.118 --> 01:02:15.999]  Kisses Israel's rear end all the time.
[01:02:16.039 --> 01:02:19.160]  They don't care about the Lebanese, all the mess going on over there.
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:22.601]  But anyway, just pretend for a minute that they do.
[01:02:23.581 --> 01:02:38.605]  It says, I, George Bush, President of the United States of America, determine that the actions of certain persons to undermine Lebanon's legitimate and democratically elected government or democratic institutions to contribute to the deliberate breakdown of the rule of law in Lebanon
[01:02:39.295 --> 01:02:40.436]  Including blah, blah, blah.
[01:02:40.576 --> 01:02:44.099]  I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with the threat.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:56.067]  And what he hereby orders, basically all property and interest in property that are in the United States are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in.
[01:02:56.948 --> 01:03:01.251]  If the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of State
[01:03:02.302 --> 01:03:02.762]  Says so.
[01:03:02.842 --> 01:03:20.388]  So basically, what they're doing is, they're saying, if we, if the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, suspects you of contributing to something we don't like in Lebanon, in any way, shape, form, or fashion, we can block and seize your assets, and there is no judicial appeal to this.
[01:03:20.988 --> 01:03:23.789]  You see, that's why it's a police state alert.
[01:03:24.029 --> 01:03:24.669]  Isn't that wonderful?
[01:03:26.238 --> 01:03:28.020]  No prior notice or listing?
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:28.640]  Pursuant?
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.621]  Yeah, too bad.
[01:03:29.661 --> 01:03:31.643]  You know, no due process for you Americans.
[01:03:31.783 --> 01:03:32.243]  Tough luck.
[01:03:33.584 --> 01:03:33.945]  Okay.
[01:03:34.265 --> 01:03:35.586]  Well, once again, I hear the music.
[01:03:36.086 --> 01:03:36.847]  Music means break.
[01:03:37.688 --> 01:03:39.969]  And we'll be back in about three minutes.
[01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:42.772]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones on the GCN Network.
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:55.501]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:03:55.821 --> 01:03:58.602]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:03:58.882 --> 01:04:03.025]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:04.285]  So what do you do?
[01:04:04.605 --> 01:04:09.168]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:04:09.668 --> 01:04:11.790]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:26.983]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:04:27.023 --> 01:04:34.089]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:04:34.429 --> 01:04:38.833]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:04:39.274 --> 01:04:41.056]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[01:04:41.076 --> 01:04:41.296]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:04:55.715 --> 01:05:01.181]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:01.541 --> 01:05:09.169]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:09.867 --> 01:05:16.930]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:28.755]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.055 --> 01:05:32.537]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:32.997 --> 01:05:34.978]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.278 --> 01:05:39.140]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:52.358 --> 01:05:56.461]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[01:05:56.721 --> 01:06:01.785]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[01:06:02.105 --> 01:06:06.729]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[01:06:07.089 --> 01:06:09.050]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[01:06:09.351 --> 01:06:15.195]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:16.336]  And it works.
[01:06:16.776 --> 01:06:18.237]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[01:06:18.617 --> 01:06:19.617]  Now it's your turn.
[01:06:19.877 --> 01:06:22.238]  Today you can get a full bottle of Tautenol.
[01:06:22.399 --> 01:06:26.660]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:30.062]  See what Tautenol can do for you and your confidence.
[01:06:30.442 --> 01:06:32.643]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[01:06:32.843 --> 01:06:35.184]  For your risk-free bottle of Tautenol, call 1-800-894-5152.
[01:06:35.244 --> 01:06:35.464]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[01:06:35.484 --> 01:06:37.365]  Tautenol is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[01:06:44.688 --> 01:06:45.289]  Guaranteed.
[01:06:45.309 --> 01:06:45.509]  Call 1-800-894-5152.
[01:06:45.569 --> 01:06:45.949]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[01:06:45.969 --> 01:06:49.213]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:49.233 --> 01:06:50.714]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:11.005 --> 01:07:20.090]  Alright, this is Bob Dacey back once again for Alex Jones and my police state section here is over.
[01:07:20.111 --> 01:07:21.371]  We're going to cover some more news.
[01:07:21.411 --> 01:07:23.773]  Now this news is from Fox News.
[01:07:24.133 --> 01:07:25.754]  I apologize, it's from Fox News.
[01:07:25.774 --> 01:07:26.554]  They handed it to me.
[01:07:26.694 --> 01:07:29.676]  It's not my fault that it's from the faux news channel.
[01:07:29.716 --> 01:07:31.757]  We distort, you comply.
[01:07:31.837 --> 01:07:36.480]  But anyway, it's in Washington and it's about the U.S.
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:39.242]  officials begin crafting an Iran bombing plan.
[01:07:39.824 --> 01:07:43.966]  Of course, you know, Fox News wants to bomb everything, so I guess that's why they put this up.
[01:07:44.346 --> 01:07:45.646]  This is by James Rosen.
[01:07:47.047 --> 01:07:48.588]  September 11th, they put this out.
[01:07:48.768 --> 01:07:49.268]  Washington.
[01:07:50.108 --> 01:08:03.014]  A recent decision by German officials to withhold support for any new sanctions against Iran has pushed a broad spectrum of officials in Washington to develop potential scenarios for a military attack on the Islamic regime.
[01:08:03.714 --> 01:08:05.415]  Fox News confirmed Tuesday.
[01:08:06.371 --> 01:08:20.645]  Later on in the article it says, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns, the most ardent proponent of a diplomatic resolution to the problem of Iran's nuclear ambitions, has had his chance on the Iranian account and come up empty.
[01:08:22.767 --> 01:08:26.071]  So you see, if you tried
[01:08:26.913 --> 01:08:34.436]  If a diplomatic approach in Germany doesn't want to punish Iran, then everything has failed and now you've got to bomb the snot out of them.
[01:08:34.516 --> 01:08:37.477]  See, that makes a lot of sense, I guess, if you're a neocon.
[01:08:38.737 --> 01:08:54.223]  Political and military officers, as well as weapons of mass destruction specialists at the State Department, are now advising Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that the diplomatic approach favored by Burns has failed and the administration must actively prepare for military intervention of some kind.
[01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:56.912]  You know, I'm sorry, I just don't understand the logic.
[01:08:57.032 --> 01:09:01.055]  Germany doesn't want to participate in sanctions, so we've got to bomb the snot out of them.
[01:09:01.075 --> 01:09:02.415]  I mean, that's what that article says.
[01:09:02.996 --> 01:09:03.456]  Right there.
[01:09:04.137 --> 01:09:04.817]  That's what it says.
[01:09:05.638 --> 01:09:06.318]  That's pathetic.
[01:09:07.119 --> 01:09:07.459]  You know?
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:10.221]  Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran.
[01:09:10.241 --> 01:09:10.962]  You know, all that stuff.
[01:09:12.222 --> 01:09:22.850]  And remember, if we attack Iran, this is going to be brought to you by the same lying pack of liars that brought you the Iraq War based on a pack of lies.
[01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:24.271]  Just remember that.
[01:09:24.853 --> 01:09:45.546]  You know, the non-existent weapons of mass destruction, and all that horse pocky about how we're gonna, the Iraqis were gonna welcome us with open arms, and it was gonna be a cakewalk, and it was gonna be so wonderful, and they were gonna throw flowers in front of us as we marched into Baghdad, and it was just gonna be so great, and all that nonsense.
[01:09:45.566 --> 01:09:47.948]  Yeah, the same pack of liars
[01:09:49.207 --> 01:09:57.011]  that has gotten into this quagmire over there is the same pack of prevaricators that wants to invade Iran.
[01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:03.974]  You know, this is off the top of my head, why can't Iran have a nuclear weapon?
[01:10:04.695 --> 01:10:05.695]  Am I allowed to say that?
[01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:11.418]  I mean, you know, Pakistan has nuclear weapons and they're a bunch of crazy Arabs, right?
[01:10:11.438 --> 01:10:18.902]  I mean, of course the Iranians aren't crazy Arabs, they're crazy Iranians, but the average beer-guzzling American doesn't
[01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:26.395]  They think they're all the same and they couldn't even find Iran or Syria or Iraq on a map.
[01:10:27.296 --> 01:10:30.038]  Heck, a fifth of them can't even find the United States on a map.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.160]  I mean, you know.
[01:10:33.401 --> 01:10:36.424]  Anyway, why can't they have a nuclear weapon?
[01:10:36.824 --> 01:10:38.125]  I mean, everybody else does.
[01:10:39.786 --> 01:10:42.228]  Israel's got like three or four hundred of them.
[01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:46.171]  They're stomping on the Lebanese right now.
[01:10:46.251 --> 01:10:49.094]  Why can't Iran have a nuclear weapon?
[01:10:50.361 --> 01:10:50.762]  Why not?
[01:10:51.182 --> 01:10:54.145]  I mean, don't they have a right to defend themselves from Israel?
[01:10:55.046 --> 01:10:55.426]  I don't know.
[01:10:55.446 --> 01:10:57.388]  I mean, India's got nuclear weapons.
[01:10:58.388 --> 01:10:59.650]  China's got nuclear weapons.
[01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:01.371]  We got nuclear weapons.
[01:11:01.451 --> 01:11:03.633]  We're the only country that's ever used them on anybody.
[01:11:04.494 --> 01:11:05.234]  Russia's got them.
[01:11:05.395 --> 01:11:06.255]  Lots of people have them.
[01:11:06.435 --> 01:11:08.037]  So why can't the Iranians have them?
[01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:11.700]  Is it because they're crazy fundamentalists or something?
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:13.862]  Or is it because they got a lot of oil underneath their dirt?
[01:11:17.122 --> 01:11:19.803]  Besides which, they're not even working on developing it.
[01:11:19.843 --> 01:11:21.323]  All that stuff is a big fat lie anyway.
[01:11:23.344 --> 01:11:25.824]  So anyway, that's that.
[01:11:25.864 --> 01:11:26.485]  Another article.
[01:11:27.925 --> 01:11:33.927]  This is from www.indiebay.org by Paul Revere.
[01:11:34.527 --> 01:11:37.147]  Stand down September 14th and marshal law.
[01:11:39.308 --> 01:11:45.910]  An Air Force stand down is scheduled for 9-14 in response to nuclear warheads mistakenly flown over U.S.
[01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:46.510]  airspace.
[01:11:47.668 --> 01:11:49.569]  Langley planes to be grounded.
[01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:57.594]  The Air Force has ordered a stand down for all jet fighters and bombers for September 14th by Stephanie Heinatz.
[01:11:59.416 --> 01:12:01.357]  September the 7th, Langley Air Force Base.
[01:12:01.477 --> 01:12:17.027]  Planes at Langley Air Force Base will be grounded September the 14th in response to an incident last week when a B-52 bomber was mistakenly armed with six nuclear warheads and flown for three hours across several states.
[01:12:17.904 --> 01:12:23.188]  The stand down was ordered by Air Combat Command and includes all jet fighters and bombers in the Air Force.
[01:12:25.971 --> 01:12:32.316]  The command headquartered at Langley oversees all of the service's fighters and bombers.
[01:12:33.436 --> 01:12:38.981]  To mistakenly load nuclear weapons on a bomber, military officials told the Associated Press,
[01:12:39.873 --> 01:12:42.374]  Safety protocols likely would have been ignored.
[01:12:43.175 --> 01:12:44.416]  You think so, huh?
[01:12:45.276 --> 01:12:45.476]  Yeah.
[01:12:45.816 --> 01:12:54.641]  To mistakenly load nukes on a bomber, probably, they think here, it's likely that the safety protocols would have been ignored.
[01:12:54.661 --> 01:12:57.143]  What do they do, store those things in a shed or something?
[01:12:59.084 --> 01:13:02.866]  On August the 30th, a B-52 with six nuclear-tipped cruise missiles
[01:13:03.607 --> 01:13:05.468]  Gee, how about that?
[01:13:33.641 --> 01:13:37.984]  Maybe, you know, maybe our government really is, maybe our Air Force really is stupid.
[01:13:38.064 --> 01:13:39.345]  You know, maybe that's it.
[01:13:39.825 --> 01:13:57.596]  Maybe they blew off, on September 11th, they ignored their own protocol four times in a row and let those four planes crash into various things, one of them the ground and three buildings, because our people who run our Air Force really are stupid.
[01:13:58.061 --> 01:13:58.802]  I don't know, maybe they are.
[01:13:58.842 --> 01:14:00.343]  Maybe we're just all wrong.
[01:14:00.383 --> 01:14:04.307]  Maybe the we is stupid defense that I was talking about yesterday is valid.
[01:14:05.228 --> 01:14:09.973]  Yeah, the people that run our military is stupid and therefore when anything goes wrong it ain't their fault.
[01:14:11.434 --> 01:14:15.559]  Okay, now we're going to morph into September 11th again.
[01:14:15.619 --> 01:14:18.001]  We're going to be taking phone calls pretty soon.
[01:14:19.768 --> 01:14:26.252]  Uh, I want to, uh, before we do that, I want to, uh, read a story that came out yesterday.
[01:14:26.272 --> 01:14:28.174]  It's on the Raw Story.
[01:14:29.154 --> 01:14:34.738]  On 9-1-1 anniversary, Fox debunks conspiracy theories once and for all.
[01:14:35.819 --> 01:14:36.359]  Okay, y'all.
[01:14:37.099 --> 01:14:42.123]  Fox News has now debunked all the conspiracy theories.
[01:14:42.423 --> 01:14:43.443]  So y'all can all relax.
[01:14:44.064 --> 01:14:48.967]  This is by, this was filed by Dave Edwards and Jason Ryan for the Raw Story.
[01:14:50.402 --> 01:14:57.224]  On the morning of the sixth anniversary of the September 11th attacks, Fox News Channel's Fox and Friends, oh boy, Fox and Friends!
[01:14:57.484 --> 01:15:00.065]  Oh yeah, you know, a real deep, deep, deep show.
[01:15:00.625 --> 01:15:10.889]  Fox and Friends sought to debunk conspiracy theories about the tragedy with the help of guest James Meigs, editor-in-chief of Popular Mechanics Magazine.
[01:15:12.429 --> 01:15:17.311]  Oh yeah, that's right, Popular Mechanics Magazine, that magazine that's, uh, the, um,
[01:15:18.314 --> 01:15:18.954]  What was it?
[01:15:19.094 --> 01:15:27.177]  One of the top guys at Popular Mechanics is a guy by the name of Chertoff, who's related to Chertoff, the Homeland Security guy, that magazine.
[01:15:28.378 --> 01:15:29.318]  Uh, James Meigs.
[01:15:29.378 --> 01:15:40.182]  Still many crazy conspiracy theories, said host Steve Doocy, adding that Meigs was there to debunk all of those 9-1-1 myths once and for all.
[01:15:41.182 --> 01:15:45.204]  Okay, so on Fox & Friends, you got this Meigs dude who's gonna
[01:15:45.982 --> 01:15:47.663]  Debunk all of the 9-1-1 myths.
[01:15:47.883 --> 01:15:48.843]  Okay, all, you got it?
[01:15:49.323 --> 01:15:49.743]  All of them.
[01:15:51.224 --> 01:15:53.044]  Ducey later yelled out, Rosie!
[01:15:53.184 --> 01:16:04.308]  As co-host Allison Camerota led into a question about theories endorsed by celebrities such as the former VUC cast member O'Donnell, actor Charlie Sheen, and director David Lynch.
[01:16:05.422 --> 01:16:17.927]  Rosie is the one that pops in mind, said Camerata, summarizing one conspiracy position about the World Trade Center's collapses as, fire can't melt steel so the towers must not have fallen just because planes flew into them, end quote.
[01:16:19.448 --> 01:16:30.472]  Quote, what we've done in three years at Popular Mechanics of looking into these theories is to try to find the facts that the conspiracy theorists themselves cite as evidence of their claims, said Meeks.
[01:16:31.112 --> 01:16:33.954]  Quote, in this case they say that because steel melts at 2700 degrees,
[01:16:35.487 --> 01:16:38.490]  And then Meigs also talks about the World Trade Center 7 and the Pennsylvania crash.
[01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:39.931]  And what's funny about this is there's a clip.
[01:16:57.351 --> 01:17:13.779]  Of this on YouTube somewhere and On this show they have actually destroyed every single 9-1-1 conspiracy theory in three minutes So we can all just relax now The Fox News Channel has solved it all for us.
[01:17:13.859 --> 01:17:21.462]  Don't worry about anything in three minutes They have debunked all of the 9-1-1 conspiracy theories.
[01:17:21.662 --> 01:17:22.503]  So don't worry about it.
[01:17:22.523 --> 01:17:24.704]  Don't worry about the science Don't worry about logic.
[01:17:24.764 --> 01:17:25.264]  Don't worry about
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.182]  All the coincidences, they have taken care of it for you.
[01:17:29.242 --> 01:17:36.226]  So you can all relax and go watch Geraldo Rivera talk about scantily clad women trying to get on Southwest Airlines.
[01:17:36.366 --> 01:17:36.746]  Okay?
[01:17:36.926 --> 01:17:37.546]  Not a big deal.
[01:17:38.927 --> 01:17:39.548]  All right.
[01:17:39.648 --> 01:17:50.094]  Now, I have from, we're going to get into September 11th here because yesterday, I didn't even touch the surface of the
[01:17:52.116 --> 01:17:54.297]  The things that stink about September 11th.
[01:17:54.377 --> 01:17:55.418]  I didn't even get close.
[01:17:56.078 --> 01:17:57.519]  I had a bunch of real good callers.
[01:17:57.959 --> 01:18:01.201]  I'm looking at what's called the Top 40.
[01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:06.483]  And what that is, is from www.911truth.org.
[01:18:07.764 --> 01:18:14.047]  And what it is, is their version of 40 reasons to doubt the official story about September 11th.
[01:18:16.337 --> 01:18:22.122]  What I want to do, we want to put up the number, have people call in, and we're just going to kind of kick all this around.
[01:18:22.762 --> 01:18:23.543]  The number is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:18:23.563 --> 01:18:23.683]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:18:23.723 --> 01:18:28.907]  We're going to be talking more about September 11th and the fact that it was an inside job.
[01:18:28.927 --> 01:18:32.270]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones, and I'll be back after this break.
[01:18:54.597 --> 01:18:59.101]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:18:59.441 --> 01:19:03.545]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:19:03.825 --> 01:19:04.385]  We listened.
[01:19:04.685 --> 01:19:09.670]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:10.430]  We listened.
[01:19:10.811 --> 01:19:13.853]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:19:14.293 --> 01:19:14.794]  We listened.
[01:19:15.254 --> 01:19:19.316]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:19:19.716 --> 01:19:20.196]  We listened.
[01:19:20.536 --> 01:19:25.778]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:19:26.198 --> 01:19:27.539]  Again, we listened.
[01:19:27.919 --> 01:19:29.460]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:30.621]  We're good to go.

[01:21:01.757 --> 01:21:03.098]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:21:03.278 --> 01:21:06.621]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Cal Bend Pure Soaps?

[01:21:52.344 --> 01:22:00.407]  Hi, this is Jeff Rentz, and if you're interested in suppressed natural cures and rare exotic remedies, this may be the most important message you'll hear for a long time.
[01:22:00.787 --> 01:22:10.089]  There's an opportunity right now for a limited number of listeners to acquire an amazing, blacklisted, naturally occurring compound with very unusual ionic properties.
[01:22:10.450 --> 01:22:14.771]  In fact, it's considered the single most important remedy in all of Ayurvedic medicine.
[01:22:15.271 --> 01:22:27.360]  Medical studies have been conducted abroad on the effects this rare mineral-like compound has on energy, diabetes, tumors, ulcers, memory, and brain function, not to mention reproductive health, exercise recovery, and arthritis.
[01:22:27.661 --> 01:22:32.604]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made.
[01:22:32.965 --> 01:22:36.327]  However, it's still quite legal to own this compound, and the best part?
[01:22:36.707 --> 01:22:38.208]  My listeners pay nothing down.
[01:22:38.289 --> 01:22:40.670]  Simply go to blacklistedherb.com.
[01:22:40.690 --> 01:22:42.632]  That's blacklistedherb.com.
[01:22:43.012 --> 01:22:43.332]  Or call 815-259-4552.
[01:22:43.352 --> 01:22:43.973]  That's 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:23:03.863 --> 01:23:10.290]  All right, Bob Desi, back for Alex Jones on the Alex Jones Show on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:23:10.791 --> 01:23:18.920]  Alex's websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com.
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:24.226]  And by the way, what y'all need to do is you need to buy a copy of the latest edition of Terror Storm.
[01:23:24.266 --> 01:23:25.007]  That's what you need to do.
[01:23:25.647 --> 01:23:28.269]  You can call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:23:28.349 --> 01:23:31.672]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:23:32.973 --> 01:23:35.115]  And order a copy of Terror Storm.
[01:23:35.155 --> 01:23:36.116]  It's been updated.
[01:23:36.876 --> 01:23:42.361]  It's an awesome, well-documented, technically perfect film.
[01:23:43.001 --> 01:23:47.385]  And you need to get that, see it, make copies of it, and pass it out to all your friends.
[01:23:47.485 --> 01:23:48.486]  Because Terror Storm
[01:23:49.668 --> 01:23:50.729]  This is awesome.
[01:23:51.210 --> 01:23:51.990]  It's accurate.
[01:23:52.391 --> 01:23:55.514]  And it's one of Alex Jones' best pieces.
[01:23:55.574 --> 01:23:56.975]  I haven't seen Endgame yet.
[01:23:57.055 --> 01:23:58.637]  And pretty soon Endgame's coming out.
[01:23:58.657 --> 01:24:00.558]  And you're going to have to get that one too.
[01:24:01.079 --> 01:24:02.700]  I've seen the trailer for Endgame.
[01:24:03.701 --> 01:24:05.383]  I haven't seen the whole film yet.
[01:24:05.443 --> 01:24:08.726]  But anyway, buy a copy of the new version of Terror Storm.
[01:24:08.766 --> 01:24:10.668]  You can also get that if you're in the Austin area.
[01:24:11.783 --> 01:24:22.588]  Okay, where was I before the break?
[01:24:22.648 --> 01:24:35.714]  Oh yeah, we're going to get into September 11th again, despite the fact that Fox News has completely debunked every single conspiracy theory on their little daytime show in only three minutes.
[01:24:36.374 --> 01:24:40.616]  Despite the fact that they've done that, I just can't seem to get this out of my head.
[01:24:41.357 --> 01:24:51.846]  So we're going to talk about a bunch of the reasons to doubt the official story of September 11th, and I'm looking at this top 40 here from 911truth.org.
[01:24:52.767 --> 01:24:58.212]  And the first one on the list, I can't go through all these because there's 40 of them, and we don't have that much time, plus we're going to be taking calls.
[01:24:58.772 --> 01:25:06.099]  We've got Wes in Tennessee coming up, and then Bob in Kansas, and then we've got Jeff in Texas after him.
[01:25:06.119 --> 01:25:06.960]  So y'all hang in there.
[01:25:09.548 --> 01:25:13.836]  Number one, according to this list, is the day itself, evidence of complicity.
[01:25:14.277 --> 01:25:16.260]  First one is the AWOL chain of command.
[01:25:17.202 --> 01:25:19.666]  I mean, these guys are what?
[01:25:19.787 --> 01:25:21.390]  I mean, according to this,
[01:25:22.279 --> 01:25:37.989]  It is well documented that the officials topping the chain of command for a response to a domestic attack, George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Myers, Montague Winfield, all found reason to do something else during the actual attacks other than assuming their duties as decision makers.
[01:25:38.029 --> 01:25:47.716]  Yeah, you know, like, for example, our imperious leader himself elected to sit there in the school reading My Pet Goat to a bunch of first graders.
[01:25:48.928 --> 01:25:51.689]  You know, and the Secret Service didn't even grab him and get him out of there.
[01:25:52.169 --> 01:25:54.889]  Hey George, you're the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.
[01:25:54.930 --> 01:25:55.850]  We're under attack.
[01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:57.570]  Why don't you do something?
[01:25:58.490 --> 01:26:00.051]  My pet goat.
[01:26:00.991 --> 01:26:01.771]  You know, come on.
[01:26:02.011 --> 01:26:02.871]  Something wrong there.
[01:26:03.332 --> 01:26:05.252]  I think they just didn't want him to screw something up.
[01:26:05.552 --> 01:26:06.412]  You know, that's what I think.
[01:26:06.432 --> 01:26:10.173]  Because he can't put two sentences together without looking at a teleprompter.
[01:26:10.213 --> 01:26:12.994]  So, I think they just didn't want him to screw things up.
[01:26:14.785 --> 01:26:15.446]  I don't think so.
[01:26:32.071 --> 01:26:32.611]  Ridiculous.
[01:26:33.191 --> 01:26:35.072]  And we talked about that yesterday.
[01:26:35.372 --> 01:26:37.453]  Another one was, of course, the strike on the Pentagon.
[01:26:38.393 --> 01:26:56.959]  And we had a fellow that was from the military called in yesterday and made a very good point that, you know, how do you strike the Pentagon with a big, fat, gigantic airliner after everybody knows we're under attack and the Pentagon is a heavily defended military installation?
[01:26:57.079 --> 01:26:58.319]  It didn't make any sense.
[01:26:58.739 --> 01:27:01.780]  In no way, shape, form, or fashion does that make any sense.
[01:27:02.686 --> 01:27:07.369]  Okay, I'm going to take a call here from Wes in Tennessee.
[01:27:07.489 --> 01:27:08.310]  Wes, are you there?
[01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:10.711]  Hey, how are you today?
[01:27:10.871 --> 01:27:11.692]  I'm doing alright.
[01:27:11.712 --> 01:27:12.172]  How about you?
[01:27:12.912 --> 01:27:14.093]  Just happy to be alive.
[01:27:14.533 --> 01:27:16.154]  Yeah, that's a good thing.
[01:27:16.194 --> 01:27:17.135]  Better than the alternative.
[01:27:17.335 --> 01:27:17.955]  What's on your mind?
[01:27:18.436 --> 01:27:18.896]  You bet.
[01:27:18.976 --> 01:27:20.697]  The green side looks okay to me.
[01:27:21.057 --> 01:27:21.257]  Yep.
[01:27:22.778 --> 01:27:23.579]  Excuse me, Mel.
[01:27:24.599 --> 01:27:25.260]  I beg your pardon.
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:30.283]  My lifelong friend that I grew up with in Chicago.
[01:27:31.650 --> 01:27:38.011]  Sir, two tours as a Green Beret in Vietnam, uh, started in 64.
[01:27:38.371 --> 01:27:59.855]  And, uh, he was, in addition to being a Green Beret, a specialist in explosives, served 33 years with the Chicago Police Department, broke up the plot by a Chicago street gang to pay Muammar Gaddafi $10 million
[01:28:01.127 --> 01:28:10.313]  Cash up front for a dozen finger missiles, which I'm sure made the people that fly out of O'Hare Airport real comfortable.
[01:28:10.573 --> 01:28:11.974]  So he's got a lot of credibility.
[01:28:12.014 --> 01:28:12.435]  What did he have?
[01:28:12.475 --> 01:28:13.115]  What did he tell you?
[01:28:13.916 --> 01:28:16.177]  15 years he's been the head of the band club.
[01:28:16.598 --> 01:28:27.485]  And he said, uh, even if the, uh, even if he bought the story, now I should tell you before going further, but
[01:28:28.653 --> 01:28:34.717]  Any time they have a commercial detonation of a building, they've got to have a member of the police department on spot.
[01:28:34.757 --> 01:28:38.019]  Tell you what, Wes, I want you to hold on to the break, because we're coming up on a break.
[01:28:38.039 --> 01:28:39.320]  Those commercials are merciless.
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:40.101]  So hang on.
[01:28:40.121 --> 01:28:42.422]  We'll be right back with Wes on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:42.862 --> 01:28:43.803]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.243 --> 01:28:45.844]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.785 --> 01:28:49.447]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.759 --> 01:28:58.262]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:28:58.682 --> 01:29:02.925]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:29:03.345 --> 01:29:10.189]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:17.351]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:17.671 --> 01:29:19.272]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:29:19.572 --> 01:29:22.773]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:23.033 --> 01:29:25.494]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:29:25.794 --> 01:29:32.516]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:29:32.976 --> 01:29:35.660]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[01:29:39.344 --> 01:29:39.705]  That's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:39.745 --> 01:29:41.507]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[01:29:53.127 --> 01:29:55.069]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach!
[01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:55.770]  Look!
[01:29:56.191 --> 01:29:57.252]  Up there in the sky!
[01:29:57.652 --> 01:29:58.954]  It's Non-X-Man!
[01:29:58.974 --> 01:30:00.495]  He's in a dive!
[01:30:00.515 --> 01:30:02.818]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach!
[01:30:03.118 --> 01:30:03.899]  Let's go look!
[01:30:06.102 --> 01:30:09.305]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel!
[01:30:09.705 --> 01:30:11.067]  Stop hiding them in the sand!
[01:30:11.267 --> 01:30:11.688]  Take them out!
[01:30:12.313 --> 01:30:13.013]  Let's see.
[01:30:13.033 --> 01:30:17.576]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[01:30:17.936 --> 01:30:18.416]  Don't worry.
[01:30:18.876 --> 01:30:20.377]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:30:21.017 --> 01:30:25.419]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:28.021]  Oh, I will, Non-X Man.
[01:30:28.161 --> 01:30:30.902]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[01:30:33.003 --> 01:30:35.624]  Don't let Non-X Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[01:30:36.104 --> 01:30:39.586]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:30:40.106 --> 01:30:41.167]  It's in the foot care aisle at
[01:30:43.254 --> 01:30:44.858]  We're good to go.
[01:30:52.712 --> 01:30:54.554]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:30:54.674 --> 01:30:59.858]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:31:00.038 --> 01:31:01.379]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:31:01.659 --> 01:31:09.826]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:31:10.046 --> 01:31:15.831]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:31:15.851 --> 01:31:17.732]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:31:17.792 --> 01:31:19.914]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:24.318]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:31:24.498 --> 01:31:26.660]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:34.468]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:31:35.418 --> 01:31:35.658]  We're good.
[01:32:07.076 --> 01:32:13.562]  All right, this is Bob Basie back on the Alex Jones Show, substitute for Alex Jones today, September 12th.
[01:32:14.222 --> 01:32:24.811]  Before the break, we were talking to Wes, and Wes, you said that you have a real good friend who is ex-Green Beret, ex-police, and he knows about, uh, did you say explosives?
[01:32:27.233 --> 01:32:27.954]  Is that what you told me?
[01:32:28.555 --> 01:32:31.197]  Yeah, he witnessed over a hundred commercial
[01:32:31.687 --> 01:32:32.448]  Demolitions.
[01:32:32.528 --> 01:32:35.490]  They always have to have a member of the police department.
[01:32:35.970 --> 01:32:37.231]  Go straight to the bottom line.
[01:32:37.251 --> 01:32:38.492]  What did he tell you?
[01:32:38.592 --> 01:32:41.934]  I'll just throw a couple of quick things at you.
[01:32:42.794 --> 01:32:56.364]  If the supports had given way and the floors stacked up like they were claiming they did, it would have taken longer than 9.2 seconds for two 110 story buildings to collapse.
[01:32:56.504 --> 01:32:57.905]  Absolutely.
[01:32:58.885 --> 01:32:59.726]  The pillars
[01:33:00.592 --> 01:33:03.673]  That we could see that we're still upright.
[01:33:03.833 --> 01:33:09.616]  We're sheared off at a 45 degree angle, which is exactly the way they place the charges.
[01:33:09.676 --> 01:33:16.999]  So when those supports slip, they slip toward the center and cause the building to fall within its own diameter.
[01:33:17.439 --> 01:33:26.022]  You mean to tell me that it's not another one of those wild coincidences that some of those columns were photographed having 45 degree angle cuts on them?
[01:33:26.523 --> 01:33:27.603]  You mean that's not a coincidence?
[01:33:30.228 --> 01:33:32.589]  Popular Mechanics debunked those theories.
[01:33:33.069 --> 01:33:38.131]  It is about as credible as having Alfred E. Newman do it for Bad Magazine.
[01:33:38.331 --> 01:33:40.812]  Well, that's what they want us to do for the rest of the whole country.
[01:33:40.872 --> 01:33:41.112]  What?
[01:33:41.213 --> 01:33:41.733]  Me worry?
[01:33:41.853 --> 01:33:42.773]  I don't know about anything.
[01:33:42.813 --> 01:33:43.433]  Who cares?
[01:33:43.453 --> 01:33:44.054]  You know?
[01:33:44.874 --> 01:33:45.874]  That's the goal.
[01:33:46.975 --> 01:33:56.939]  So your friend who's a demolition expert is corroborating the loony bins who say that those 45 degree angle cuts had a purpose, right?
[01:33:57.389 --> 01:33:58.410]  Yep, sure enough.
[01:33:58.490 --> 01:34:02.052]  I mean, you know, it'd take me three days to go through all the stuff that he told me.
[01:34:02.892 --> 01:34:09.916]  I'll tell you one thing, he said he'd stake his entire 33-year career in the fact that I was going for a lockdown.
[01:34:09.936 --> 01:34:16.440]  You know, I am so, so cautious and so conservative about what I consider to be proof.
[01:34:16.921 --> 01:34:22.104]  That's what I'm known for in Austin in my TV show is, you know, I gotta have a lockdown.
[01:34:23.024 --> 01:34:44.471]  The only thing I don't like about the 45 degree angle cut thing is that famous photo that everybody's seen with the fireman several feet in front of that monster column with that big huge 45 degree cut on it with slag marks all over it is I've never seen anything on that photo that says when it was taken or by whom.
[01:34:45.191 --> 01:34:46.751]  I've never seen that on the net.
[01:34:46.791 --> 01:34:48.392]  I've seen the photograph many times
[01:34:49.071 --> 01:34:53.853]  But it's never been documented when it was taken and by whom it was taken.
[01:34:54.413 --> 01:34:56.654]  And it always bothered me just a little bit.
[01:34:57.135 --> 01:35:09.880]  You know, because you could say, you know, so well, you see that 45-degree angle cut was made several days later when the demolition crew came in and sliced it deliberately to knock down a piece that hadn't fallen down yet.
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:11.701]  You know, they can come up with stuff like that.
[01:35:12.441 --> 01:35:16.843]  You know, that, I'd like to know more about that photo, but I never have been able to find anything about it.
[01:35:16.863 --> 01:35:18.184]  If any of you people out there know
[01:35:19.324 --> 01:35:20.925]  That footage was taken off of CNN.
[01:35:46.738 --> 01:35:53.581]  Well, the photo... I'd like to see the footage because the photo was a still.
[01:35:54.281 --> 01:35:55.402]  It's crystal clear.
[01:35:55.442 --> 01:35:56.302]  That wasn't video.
[01:35:56.502 --> 01:35:57.463]  That was a photograph.
[01:35:59.264 --> 01:36:02.445]  So I don't know... Why would they... It wasn't just one.
[01:36:03.085 --> 01:36:03.606]  Well, yeah.
[01:36:03.786 --> 01:36:05.266]  Again, you're right.
[01:36:05.347 --> 01:36:06.167]  It wasn't just one.
[01:36:06.567 --> 01:36:14.971]  But it's the one that has the most clear one and it's got the slag marks all over it that apparently are indicative of being cut by thermate.
[01:36:15.638 --> 01:36:18.702]  But again, you know, I'd like to see, I'd just like to see more about it.
[01:36:19.082 --> 01:36:24.709]  I'll tell you what really helped me in that was Professor Jones.
[01:36:25.650 --> 01:36:36.202]  You know, because when he started talking about the thermate residue and started to do scientific experiments on it and finding out that some of the stuff that came off these columns
[01:36:37.072 --> 01:36:46.139]  And was in the dust of the World Trade Center catastrophe, exactly matched what you would expect as the residue of a thermate reaction.
[01:36:46.899 --> 01:36:52.863]  Now that's, now that's like scientific dig, you know, dig your teeth into that and you can sink your teeth into that.
[01:36:53.444 --> 01:36:56.786]  You know, that, that really, really cinched it.
[01:36:57.126 --> 01:37:03.511]  Plus, even, even back in 2002, Athena got a hold of one of those columns from Building 7.
[01:37:04.719 --> 01:37:05.460]  I don't know.
[01:37:25.308 --> 01:37:35.377]  And, you know, most of it's missing, and they got a photograph of it, and they did a quick analysis of it, and it had this intergranular melting with sulfidation.
[01:37:35.877 --> 01:37:38.419]  And they were scratching their heads going, what the heck is this?
[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:39.940]  We need to look into this.
[01:37:40.201 --> 01:37:41.081]  This doesn't happen.
[01:37:41.382 --> 01:37:42.963]  But it never went anywhere.
[01:37:43.463 --> 01:37:43.764]  You know?
[01:37:44.064 --> 01:37:45.665]  So now it's in Building 7.
[01:37:46.846 --> 01:37:49.228]  You know, the one that didn't have any plane hit it?
[01:37:50.049 --> 01:37:53.512]  Melting steel, which of course I would throw that in the face of these
[01:37:54.489 --> 01:37:59.915]  Bozo's at Popular Mechanics who said, Oh no, the steel didn't have to melt.
[01:38:00.175 --> 01:38:02.738]  No Bozo's at Popular Mechanics.
[01:38:03.058 --> 01:38:06.742]  The steel did melt.
[01:38:07.343 --> 01:38:08.564]  It did.
[01:38:08.604 --> 01:38:14.431]  It was still a couple thousand degrees hot a couple weeks after the buildings came down.
[01:38:17.114 --> 01:38:18.555]  Fox News in one minute?
[01:38:18.575 --> 01:38:19.475]  I think you did.
[01:38:19.735 --> 01:38:20.555]  Oh, good!
[01:38:21.296 --> 01:38:22.116]  I think you did.
[01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:23.916]  I'm going to email you some stuff.
[01:38:24.017 --> 01:38:31.239]  Yeah, email that to probably Aaron at Infowars.com or something like that, and they'll check it out.
[01:38:31.559 --> 01:38:37.701]  Yeah, do it to Aaron at Infowars or Trey at Infowars.com and they'll check it out.
[01:38:37.902 --> 01:38:39.562]  Well, Russ, thank you very much for the call.
[01:38:39.582 --> 01:38:40.262]  I appreciate it.
[01:38:41.043 --> 01:38:42.363]  Okay, that was a good call.
[01:38:42.443 --> 01:38:44.444]  Okay, Bob in Kansas.
[01:38:45.327 --> 01:38:46.807]  We're not in Kansas anymore, Bob.
[01:38:46.827 --> 01:38:48.848]  We're all over the world right now.
[01:38:48.868 --> 01:38:49.168]  You there?
[01:38:49.188 --> 01:38:50.588]  Yeah, I'm here.
[01:38:51.088 --> 01:38:51.949]  Hey, what you got on your mind?
[01:38:52.929 --> 01:38:55.269]  Hey, you know, talking about this Building 7?
[01:38:55.309 --> 01:38:55.830]  Yeah.
[01:38:56.930 --> 01:39:05.832]  If you look at all the footage and the films of what went on with Building 7, there was just a couple of little fires here and there, and then all of a sudden,
[01:39:06.325 --> 01:39:13.749]  There was a little crimp toward the middle and the building imploded just like it would have if it was demolitioned by a professional.
[01:39:13.989 --> 01:39:23.494]  Oh, but don't you know that on September 11th the laws of physics were suspended and you get to have a symmetrical collapse caused by asymmetrical damage?
[01:39:23.514 --> 01:39:24.054]  Didn't you know that?
[01:39:24.654 --> 01:39:25.515]  Oh man, I'll tell you!
[01:39:25.775 --> 01:39:32.498]  You know, the absolute ridiculousness of it, you know, the laws of physics, you can't mess with the laws of physics.
[01:39:32.678 --> 01:39:33.759]  And here's this building
[01:39:34.344 --> 01:39:38.547]  And then this guy that owned the building said, well, you know, let's pull it.
[01:39:38.647 --> 01:39:44.231]  And later on he said, Oh, I didn't mean let's pull it in the sense of breaking it down, like a demolition.
[01:39:44.291 --> 01:39:47.534]  I said, I meant like, let's pull a fireman out of there.
[01:39:49.175 --> 01:39:53.198]  It takes, it takes, it takes a long time to set up all those charges.
[01:39:53.558 --> 01:39:59.223]  And there's no way, even if he would have said, well, we had a demolition because it was a safety hazard, no way he could have had all it done.
[01:39:59.283 --> 01:40:02.425]  And Bob, two things I'd like to add to what you just said.
[01:40:03.351 --> 01:40:07.814]  Number one, and this is bragging rights here, okay?
[01:40:09.395 --> 01:40:23.546]  When you watch those videos of Building 7 coming down, the first ones that came out, and they're still up there, if you look in the upper right hand corner of those videos, you will see a logo, a TV station logo that says KI-42.
[01:40:24.706 --> 01:40:25.947]  It's on lots of those things.
[01:40:26.428 --> 01:40:30.691]  It's on the one you see, the main one, the one that's been used for years and years and years.
[01:40:30.751 --> 01:40:31.551]  It says KI-42 on it.
[01:40:33.095 --> 01:40:35.296]  That video came from Austin, Texas.
[01:40:35.576 --> 01:40:36.916]  That came from my hometown.
[01:40:37.576 --> 01:40:50.219]  And the person who supplied that, both to Alex Jones and to Eric Cushman years ago, was Jeff Kantoff.
[01:40:51.079 --> 01:40:57.621]  Jeff is a dear friend of mine, and he is one of the producers of the Simple Truth TV show that I host.
[01:40:58.436 --> 01:41:01.978]  What he was doing on the morning of September 11th, he was thinking.
[01:41:02.258 --> 01:41:03.259]  You know, he was thinking.
[01:41:04.019 --> 01:41:09.902]  And he stayed at home and he kept shoving video cassettes into his recorder all day long.
[01:41:10.322 --> 01:41:15.965]  And it was Jeff's video that ended up all over the internet.
[01:41:15.985 --> 01:41:24.530]  So whenever you see that KI42 logo in the upper right hand corner of all those building 7 collapses, you can thank Jeff Cantor for that.
[01:41:26.187 --> 01:41:27.727]  So, I wanted to say that.
[01:41:27.807 --> 01:41:38.729]  Then also, I also want to talk about something that I really have never heard discussed when it comes to Building 7's collapse and controlled demolition.
[01:41:39.149 --> 01:41:43.970]  You know, Larry Silverstein, you know, he said, well, you know, maybe the smartest thing to do is to pull it.
[01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:48.751]  So he made the decision to pull and we watched the building collapse, you know?
[01:41:49.811 --> 01:41:51.511]  Has anybody ever asked this question?
[01:41:53.212 --> 01:41:55.252]  Does the New York Fire Department
[01:41:56.070 --> 01:42:04.598]  Have a controlled demolition squad that is capable of taking down a 47-story skyscraper in just a couple of hours?
[01:42:04.999 --> 01:42:05.219]  Ha!
[01:42:05.639 --> 01:42:06.961]  I'll bet you that they don't.
[01:42:08.282 --> 01:42:08.702]  What do you bet?
[01:42:10.024 --> 01:42:11.725]  Yeah, well, absolutely.
[01:42:11.765 --> 01:42:13.627]  This stuff was all done ahead of time.
[01:42:14.108 --> 01:42:20.454]  Like they said, people in charge of the security was Bush's brother, and it was all an inside job.
[01:42:20.994 --> 01:42:21.515]  Absolutely.
[01:42:21.535 --> 01:42:39.032]  I've heard the theory expressed by some very intelligent people, as a matter of fact, that because Building 7 was a spook hive, it had all these government agencies in it, that when it was built, it was pre-wired to explode.
[01:42:40.083 --> 01:42:40.683]  I've heard that.
[01:42:40.843 --> 01:42:41.904]  I've heard that theory.
[01:42:42.324 --> 01:42:52.968]  That, well, you know, there was a big disaster and for whatever reason they decided that they didn't want anybody to get to the secret records in Building 7, so they pushed a button and blew the whole thing up.
[01:42:53.028 --> 01:42:54.549]  I mean, there's one for you.
[01:42:55.429 --> 01:42:58.390]  Well, they'll probably say the towers were pre-wired.
[01:42:59.411 --> 01:43:01.251]  Well, eventually they're probably going to have to.
[01:43:01.271 --> 01:43:02.692]  They're going to have to come up with Plan B.
[01:43:03.658 --> 01:43:25.172]  You know, when you've got tons of liquid molten yellow flaming steel pouring out of the South Tower, right at the point of collapse, just before it collapses, splashing all over the place, and you try to explain what that is, and apparently the only logical explanation is thermate reaction, you've got a problem.
[01:43:26.849 --> 01:43:41.714]  I've heard somebody else suggest that there's higher levels of tritium in the whole area and there might have been even a small tactical nuke down there that actually melted the core because the core had so much steel in it and all of a sudden most of it just disappeared.
[01:43:41.834 --> 01:43:42.414]  It just melted.
[01:43:42.970 --> 01:43:58.397]  Yeah, I don't, I don't, you know, I'm not an explosive expert, but I do, I do know that there's a lot of witnesses that were in the basement area of the, of the, uh, of the towers and said that the, the, the, the basement, the area had been just obliterated.
[01:43:58.977 --> 01:44:12.400]  And I don't know why if a huge bomb took out a bunch of columns in the middle of the building, you know, right there at the beginning of the attack, why it took an hour or so for the building to fall.
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:23.242]  I don't know anything about the sequencing of demolition charges or whatever, but I do know that all the experts say that you take out the core first so that the building will come down.
[01:44:23.402 --> 01:44:25.463]  And even Peter Jennings said it.
[01:44:25.623 --> 01:44:26.723]  I mean, he said,
[01:44:27.934 --> 01:44:34.041]  Oh, the people involved in demolition know that the way to take down a building is to go for the under-infrastructure.
[01:44:34.162 --> 01:44:37.405]  You have to go for the under-infrastructure to take a building down.
[01:44:37.866 --> 01:44:43.412]  You know, he said that on September 11th as they were watching the things collapse, as number 7.
[01:44:44.413 --> 01:44:47.377]  So, anyway, you know, Bob, what else do you have to add?
[01:44:49.246 --> 01:44:49.607]  Yes, I am Bob.
[01:44:49.627 --> 01:44:50.688]  I'm a little less hoarse today.
[01:44:50.708 --> 01:44:51.549]  How am I coming in?
[01:45:06.966 --> 01:45:15.833]  No, I got a little bit of a later flight out today, so I appreciate you filling in, but there's some other stuff I need to do in New York, and I'm going to be flying out in the next 30 minutes and back to Austin.
[01:45:15.853 --> 01:45:19.636]  I'll be in the studio tomorrow, and I really want to thank you for sitting in for me and doing a fabulous job.
[01:45:19.656 --> 01:45:34.828]  I've been sitting here on hold for a few minutes listening to you, and that's exactly what I called in about, was just a general report, kind of a rundown, a chronology of what's happened while I've been here in New York, covering the 6th anniversary.
[01:45:35.476 --> 01:45:42.738]  Of the tragic attacks and of course I'm at an airport so I'm whispering not to bother people here in this little restaurant I'm in.
[01:45:43.318 --> 01:45:45.499]  But first off, you were just talking about Building 7.
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:55.522]  We all of course know about the BBC reporting that it had fallen because of fires in some footprint 25 minutes before it did and it turned out CNN had done that over an hour before.
[01:45:55.582 --> 01:45:56.742]  We know a script was put out.
[01:45:56.762 --> 01:45:57.623]  Right.
[01:45:57.643 --> 01:45:58.463]  We also did FEMA.
[01:45:59.364 --> 01:46:10.387]  Admitted that they had been there the night before, then said that they misspoke, then documents came out that they indeed had been there for the drill, uh, the night before, uh, for tripod two.
[01:46:10.407 --> 01:46:12.428]  This is all confirmed, this is all documented.
[01:46:13.688 --> 01:46:22.331]  And then on top of that, uh, just while I was here today, and understand there's hundreds of these firemen and police and emergency workers reporting on public, but I got a chance to sit down on video.
[01:46:22.371 --> 01:46:23.091]  He's very credible.
[01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:29.522]  With Kevin McPadden, who is the Air Force medic who responded down there and saved a lot of people.
[01:46:31.043 --> 01:46:38.346]  And there's a famous video of when she was not very well known as a local TV person on local television in New York, Amy Goodman of Democracy Now Today.
[01:46:39.867 --> 01:46:47.150]  She's standing there about three blocks away, about two blocks away from Building 7 and smoking at about 5 to 25 in the afternoon.
[01:46:47.931 --> 01:46:52.012]  And you see everybody looking around, you see everybody talking, you see her and she goes, alright, we're being told to get back, we're being told.
[01:46:52.753 --> 01:46:53.233]  Oh my gosh!
[01:46:53.846 --> 01:46:58.489]  And then they all start running, and then you see it go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and fall down.
[01:46:59.590 --> 01:47:05.434]  Well, uh, I have now, we've seen videos of other firemen and police who were there saying they heard a countdown.
[01:47:05.454 --> 01:47:11.238]  I, I got the chance to, and many others, they heard it over the radios, police radios, they were quokin' a bullet.
[01:47:11.659 --> 01:47:15.481]  They were over here saying, yeah, we made the decision to pull it, watch it come down.
[01:47:15.521 --> 01:47:16.662]  We have just hundreds of them.
[01:47:16.682 --> 01:47:20.665]  I mean, the problem about talking about this is there's so much evidence, you want to put it all on.
[01:47:22.065 --> 01:47:25.788]  And we've done that here and there on the show, but all together, it's just a mountain.
[01:47:26.368 --> 01:47:34.573]  But Kevin, of course, talked about how he's going to put this out on the web in the next week or so with the Prison Planet dot TV members.
[01:47:34.613 --> 01:47:36.574]  We want to download it, burn it to disk, and give it out to people.
[01:47:37.375 --> 01:47:38.095]  This is Kevin.
[01:47:38.175 --> 01:47:41.977]  I've got an interview because it's not something that's been out there before, but piecemeal.
[01:47:41.997 --> 01:47:43.658]  We've got a lengthy, hour-long interview with him.
[01:47:44.659 --> 01:47:47.661]  But he's down there doing rescue work all day long.
[01:47:48.504 --> 01:47:54.326]  Down there going in, clearing five floors himself with some other people, uh, in an old folks home.
[01:47:55.286 --> 01:47:56.466]  So all this stuff's going on in there.
[01:47:56.506 --> 01:47:58.147]  Down there late in the afternoon, totally exhausted.
[01:47:58.647 --> 01:48:02.128]  There's more firefighters, police coming in, and they say, no, no, we're not going to send more people down there.
[01:48:02.148 --> 01:48:04.789]  Something's about to happen with 7.
[01:48:05.049 --> 01:48:17.573]  And, uh, all of a sudden everybody starts acting real strange, and all the emergency workers are saying to the Red Cross that's in command, uh, and he has the fire department's city radio.
[01:48:18.702 --> 01:48:22.584]  And the guy's acting real nervous in front of everybody.
[01:48:22.604 --> 01:48:23.004]  What's going on?
[01:48:23.044 --> 01:48:23.665]  What's wrong?
[01:48:24.165 --> 01:48:28.607]  He takes his hand off and it goes, three, two, one.
[01:48:28.647 --> 01:48:30.868]  They hear the countdown.
[01:48:31.289 --> 01:48:33.610]  He goes, run for your lives!
[01:48:34.330 --> 01:48:38.852]  And they all start running and that guy had been ordered not to tell people what was going on.
[01:48:38.872 --> 01:48:41.774]  And a few minutes before all that happened, they said, they don't know what's going to happen with seven.
[01:48:41.794 --> 01:48:44.335]  They may decide to bring it down, that very person.
[01:48:44.715 --> 01:48:47.457]  And then he was in command as the liaison between all the rescue workers.
[01:48:48.195 --> 01:48:55.777]  And the fire department of the city, when I was saying the firemen were involved, they were given a cover story and told what to do and told to pull back.
[01:48:56.137 --> 01:48:58.858]  That's another bombshell, isn't it?
[01:48:58.938 --> 01:49:07.320]  It's just absolutely amazing, but long story short, we got here Friday, and you know, within two hours of getting on the ground, I was arrested.
[01:49:08.681 --> 01:49:12.562]  And there's rumors going around the internet that I was tasered, I was not tasered.
[01:49:13.704 --> 01:49:14.485]  Doc was just arrested.
[01:49:14.505 --> 01:49:15.665]  He just came over and arrested me.
[01:49:15.705 --> 01:49:18.106]  Which, by the way, was not an arrestable offense, he later had to admit.
[01:49:18.887 --> 01:49:20.208]  I have my ticket right here in my hand.
[01:49:20.228 --> 01:49:25.250]  It's a $200 fine for unauthorized use of an amplification device.
[01:49:25.290 --> 01:49:29.092]  So when we get back, I can just walk through what's happened, Bob.
[01:49:29.352 --> 01:49:29.673]  All right.
[01:49:29.713 --> 01:49:31.233]  Well, we got Alex Jones on the line.
[01:49:31.253 --> 01:49:32.354]  He's still up in New York.
[01:49:32.514 --> 01:49:34.955]  And after the break, we will return with Alex Jones.
[01:49:35.015 --> 01:49:39.658]  And he's going to give us a first-hand account, again, of what's happened in the last few days in New York.
[01:49:55.974 --> 01:49:56.475]  It's here!
[01:49:56.675 --> 01:50:01.459]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:01.819 --> 01:50:09.425]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.143 --> 01:50:17.186]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.586 --> 01:50:29.011]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.331 --> 01:50:32.892]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.292 --> 01:50:34.973]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.553 --> 01:50:39.395]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:52.888 --> 01:50:58.110]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.250 --> 01:51:06.354]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:06.594 --> 01:51:13.657]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:13.837 --> 01:51:15.117]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:15.197 --> 01:51:21.079]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.279 --> 01:51:26.361]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.481 --> 01:51:35.363]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:51:35.623 --> 01:51:38.904]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:51:41.245 --> 01:51:54.014]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.

[01:52:08.704 --> 01:52:12.345]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs.
[01:52:12.666 --> 01:52:16.307]  Two books that combined are over a thousand pages and other information.

[01:52:40.178 --> 01:52:41.318]  Before you slip into unconsciousness
[01:53:02.450 --> 01:53:22.454]  Okay, Bob Dasey back on the Alex Jones Show, and I'll guarantee you're not going to slip into unconsciousness, because we've got Alex Jones on the line right now.
[01:53:22.594 --> 01:53:24.875]  Alex, you were saying before the break about Building 7.
[01:53:27.307 --> 01:53:28.067]  Are you there, Alex?
[01:53:28.407 --> 01:53:29.008]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:53:29.048 --> 01:53:29.288]  I'm here.
[01:53:29.328 --> 01:53:30.248]  I was listening to you, Bob.
[01:53:30.708 --> 01:53:31.689]  All right.
[01:53:31.729 --> 01:53:38.291]  Now, you're saying that, okay, it's obvious now, you've got all these witnesses, that there was a countdown to blow up Building 7.
[01:53:39.552 --> 01:53:45.854]  And we have Silverstein saying it on television, saying, yeah, we gave the decision to pull it down, and I gave the order and watched it.
[01:53:46.535 --> 01:53:49.716]  But then he denied that, so I guess he has to undeny that now, I guess.
[01:53:50.096 --> 01:53:55.278]  Well, that's kind of like Rudolph Giuliani on ABC television and ABC radio.
[01:53:56.098 --> 01:53:56.638]  That day.
[01:53:56.878 --> 01:54:03.600]  And now there's another media outlet that we've got him on it saying that he was told Tower 1 and 2 were going to come down before they fell.
[01:54:05.141 --> 01:54:09.822]  And then he's been confronted three times by We Are Change and others now.
[01:54:10.602 --> 01:54:11.663]  And just says it never happened.
[01:54:12.123 --> 01:54:16.124]  And then he lied and it made local television here a few months ago.
[01:54:16.964 --> 01:54:18.465]  We covered it at prisonblinded.com.
[01:54:19.105 --> 01:54:21.106]  Because We Are Change went to the reporters and said he's a liar.
[01:54:21.206 --> 01:54:23.486]  And they first put the report out where Giuliani denied.
[01:54:23.986 --> 01:54:25.747]  Then they got so many emails from the TV station
[01:54:26.624 --> 01:54:32.669]  They went and pulled the link and put it on mainstream news here in New York that Giuliani's a liar.
[01:54:33.409 --> 01:54:36.611]  He's completely hated by the firemen, the police, everybody.
[01:54:36.892 --> 01:54:39.734]  First they lied about the dust, then it came out that they
[01:54:40.686 --> 01:54:44.729]  Close to half the victims, 47% of the remains were used to fill potholes.
[01:54:45.210 --> 01:54:47.992]  They didn't even put them in a hole in the ground.
[01:54:48.192 --> 01:54:49.673]  They didn't even put a marker on it.
[01:54:49.693 --> 01:54:51.635]  They said, well just use it to fill potholes.
[01:54:52.135 --> 01:54:54.177]  You can't make stuff up like this.
[01:54:54.757 --> 01:54:56.078]  They were under the gold Alex.
[01:54:56.098 --> 01:54:58.540]  They already got the gold out so they didn't matter anymore, right?
[01:54:59.477 --> 01:55:25.790]  I just wonder how you're going to get, once it's totally confirmed, even in the mainstream media, that Building 7 was blown up, I guess you're going to have to ask Giuliani how they managed to get a demolition squad together that quickly, and where did they get all those explosive charges, and how did they get into that building that was on fire and set them off so perfectly in such a horrible situation with the biggest disaster in United States history right across the street.
[01:55:26.543 --> 01:55:28.164]  A lot of bull horn hunters are police and firemen.
[01:55:28.184 --> 01:55:29.084]  A lot of them are not in their heads.
[01:55:29.104 --> 01:55:29.745]  Others are mad at us.
[01:55:47.422 --> 01:55:51.806]  And, uh, they just can't deal with the horror of it, so the globalists could do something like this right in front of them.
[01:55:51.826 --> 01:55:55.809]  And I said, you know about the countdown, and cops were nodding their heads, and firemen were nodding their heads.
[01:55:55.929 --> 01:56:05.937]  This is all... I'm gonna make a film about it, you know, last year's 9-11 events, this year's, uh, all the other, uh, 9-11 folks around the country that are sending us footage they want us to put in a film we want to put together.
[01:56:05.957 --> 01:56:14.284]  And I'm pretty sure that's gonna be my next film, but I'm gonna try to just put it out as quickly as possible, just to tell the story of 9-11 Truth and the effect it's having, because if it wasn't for 9-11 Truth,
[01:56:15.205 --> 01:56:17.227]  Who would have definitely already had more staged events.
[01:56:18.908 --> 01:56:26.395]  MSNBC had that poll out the other day that 65% of their respondents think that the government had something to do with 9-1-1.
[01:56:27.056 --> 01:56:26.395]  65%!
[01:56:27.256 --> 01:56:28.777]  Up from 58% last year.
[01:56:29.618 --> 01:56:31.780]  Absolutely, and it's just like the county assassination.
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:35.363]  But instead of taking 40 years to get 90%, it's going to take 6-7 years.
[01:56:38.446 --> 01:56:39.867]  I just want to thank everybody that came out.
[01:56:39.887 --> 01:56:42.668]  I want to thank everybody for their support because this was historical.
[01:56:42.748 --> 01:56:44.868]  And I'll try to write up some notes tomorrow on the show.
[01:56:44.908 --> 01:56:50.930]  I'm going to walk through, blow by blow, everything that happened, everything we witnessed, the things that happened, the different angles to it.
[01:56:51.050 --> 01:57:00.514]  But there were signs all over New York that were saying, remember it, but then forget about it and move on, was basically the slogan.
[01:57:00.534 --> 01:57:01.154]  It was worse than that.
[01:57:01.194 --> 01:57:01.934]  I forget the exact slogan.
[01:57:01.954 --> 01:57:04.175]  We've got video of it.
[01:57:05.215 --> 01:57:06.876]  Did you attend the Loose Change premiere?
[01:57:08.457 --> 01:57:13.542]  Yes, well, I've seen, you know, the Lewis Chang's comedy executive producer, so I've already seen it, but yes, I was there.
[01:57:13.923 --> 01:57:16.185]  Yeah, I was just, uh, can I hold you over until the break?
[01:57:17.146 --> 01:57:19.108]  Sure, it's, by the way, the film's not done yet.
[01:57:19.128 --> 01:57:20.029]  This was a rough cut.
[01:57:20.249 --> 01:57:20.750]  A rough cut.
[01:57:20.850 --> 01:57:22.752]  Well, I want to, we're going to hold Alex over until the break.
[01:57:22.812 --> 01:57:24.634]  I want to ask him another question when we get on the other side.
[01:57:24.974 --> 01:57:28.418]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones, GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:32.682 --> 01:57:37.545]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:37.565 --> 01:57:38.026]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.186 --> 01:57:38.966]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.166 --> 01:57:41.268]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:41.308 --> 01:57:45.090]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.425 --> 01:57:56.305]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.325 --> 01:58:00.987]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.167 --> 01:58:05.288]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.809 --> 01:58:13.591]  Yeah, live from Austin, Texas is Bob Dacey with Alex Jones on the line up in the airport.
[01:58:13.611 --> 01:58:15.312]  I think in New York is where he said he was.
[01:58:15.752 --> 01:58:19.894]  Alex, before the break, I wanted to ask you a question about the Loose Change documentary.
[01:58:19.914 --> 01:58:21.194]  Yeah.
[01:58:22.190 --> 01:58:28.674]  Was the Barry Jennings section in that documentary yet?
[01:58:29.894 --> 01:58:35.898]  I've got several different raw cuts because they're going to be done in the next month or so.
[01:58:35.918 --> 01:58:40.880]  But the part with you confronting Chairman Keene is in there.
[01:58:41.721 --> 01:58:44.282]  And yes, the Jennings is in there.
[01:58:44.850 --> 01:58:45.351]  Of course, sure.
[01:58:45.411 --> 01:58:47.272]  I mean, why don't you tell folks who Barry Jennings is?
[01:58:57.165 --> 01:58:58.446]  And he was in Building 7.
[01:59:00.006 --> 01:59:06.849]  He went up to the Emergency Command Bunker on the 23rd floor because he thought that's what you're supposed to do when a plane smacks into the North Tower.
[01:59:06.869 --> 01:59:09.730]  Like, well, let's activate the Emergency Command Bunker.
[01:59:09.810 --> 01:59:11.571]  And it was totally, totally empty.
[01:59:11.851 --> 01:59:13.772]  Half-eaten sandwiches, still steaming coffee.
[01:59:14.192 --> 01:59:14.432]  Right.
[01:59:14.472 --> 01:59:17.554]  And when he went downstairs... And there's an elevator and there's boom, boom, boom.
[01:59:17.774 --> 01:59:18.034]  Yeah.
[01:59:18.114 --> 01:59:19.014]  And it blows out the floor.
[01:59:19.054 --> 01:59:19.434]  They go down.
[01:59:19.474 --> 01:59:20.555]  There's dead bodies everywhere.
[01:59:20.575 --> 01:59:20.695]  Right.
[01:59:20.715 --> 01:59:22.396]  And the firefighter's saying, shut your eyes.
[01:59:22.876 --> 01:59:23.476]  Don't look.
[01:59:24.056 --> 01:59:25.337]  You're not supposed to see this.
[01:59:25.973 --> 01:59:33.415]  And you got to start saying the firefighters, at least some of them are, I mean they've got to know, I mean a lot of them have spoken out, but this is getting to be too much, but he's one of them.
[01:59:33.895 --> 01:59:41.237]  He's one of the commanders of the emergency management, and he sees this, this is before even the towers had fallen.
[01:59:41.598 --> 01:59:42.978]  Right, this is before the towers had fallen.
[01:59:42.998 --> 01:59:49.880]  What I want to know is, and I've been unclear on this, did he say that he testified before the 9-1-1 Commission?
[01:59:51.502 --> 01:59:52.883]  Yes, he did, and they didn't put it in there.
[01:59:53.184 --> 01:59:57.708]  Okay, so you're saying for sure that he testified before the 9-1-1 Commission, that's what you're saying?
[01:59:58.388 --> 02:00:03.853]  Uh, I'm sitting there in an airport, but from memory, he either did to the Congressional Commission or the 9-1-1 Commission, one of the two commissions.
[02:00:03.873 --> 02:00:05.175]  Okay, so... There were two.
[02:00:05.415 --> 02:00:08.077]  So his information was readily available then?
[02:00:08.958 --> 02:00:09.178]  Yes.
[02:00:09.639 --> 02:00:17.406]  And which means that when Governor Keene told me that there was no loss of life in Building 7, he must have been lying, huh?
[02:00:18.686 --> 02:00:25.209]  He's a total Blue Blood, New World Order type, and I just can't wait for the actual films out in the next few months.
[02:00:25.769 --> 02:00:31.332]  But, Bob, I just want to thank you for setting in a superb job, and I want to let you get back to all the calls.
[02:00:31.372 --> 02:00:47.559]  I like your callers calling today, and the hour that's left, and tomorrow, with their experiences here at 9-11 on the 6th anniversary, all the different angles, the things they've witnessed, what it was like, just everything that happened here, and the reviews of Endgame as well, and the new loose change, because
[02:00:48.846 --> 02:00:51.567]  It's just been so historical, and that's why I don't have any guests on tomorrow.
[02:00:52.087 --> 02:00:56.329]  I just want to ask people, the thousands that were here over the four days.
[02:00:56.369 --> 02:01:02.511]  You've got a lot of work cut out for you when you get back, don't you?
[02:01:02.731 --> 02:01:04.131]  What's an endeavor with us, though, with you?
[02:01:05.011 --> 02:01:06.572]  Well, the endgame's basically done.
[02:01:06.592 --> 02:01:07.812]  The disc has been mastered.
[02:01:07.832 --> 02:01:09.353]  The cover's done.
[02:01:09.753 --> 02:01:12.374]  It's coming off of manufacturing this week.
[02:01:13.314 --> 02:01:14.055]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:01:28.542 --> 02:01:49.139]  All that later, and that's kind of a piece of cake being an executive producer, versus being the producer, the executive producer, the writer, the director, the guy that's in and out there confronting people, and the person that voiced it, and the person that basically chose every edit, every cut that was made, and did the research to find most of the footage, and to secure the footage.
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:55.465]  It was me, Rob Jacobson and Aaron Dykes did 90% of the work, and it was
[02:01:56.221 --> 02:01:57.222]  It was.
[02:01:57.303 --> 02:02:03.451]  And of course, Michael McWhorter and Glenn Dale just came through with a lot of work as well.
[02:02:03.891 --> 02:02:06.034]  But really five people made this film.
[02:02:06.835 --> 02:02:09.719]  And it was the job.
[02:02:10.059 --> 02:02:12.042]  50 people would have made this, but I'm really proud of it.
[02:02:12.723 --> 02:02:14.265]  And now I'm going to do some cinematic films.
[02:02:15.194 --> 02:02:16.074]  In the future.
[02:02:16.094 --> 02:02:17.875]  The next two, I don't think I'm going to have any voiceover.
[02:02:17.895 --> 02:02:19.655]  And it's going to be all cinematic.
[02:02:19.675 --> 02:02:22.015]  I want to show people I can do that style of filmmaking.
[02:02:22.035 --> 02:02:25.616]  But Endgame really is a crowning achievement for the Patriot Movement, information-wise.
[02:02:25.756 --> 02:02:27.856]  It puts all the pieces back together.
[02:02:27.876 --> 02:02:31.017]  Bob, I'm going to let you go to break and come back and take everybody's calls.
[02:02:31.037 --> 02:02:34.898]  I hope everybody will still go to prisonplanet.com and see all the incredible coverage.
[02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:50.072]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:02:50.372 --> 02:02:52.614]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[02:02:52.674 --> 02:03:00.138]  Our Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box, so it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[02:03:00.479 --> 02:03:03.501]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:03:03.801 --> 02:03:07.243]  So effective, you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:03:07.563 --> 02:03:16.911]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Perky's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:03:17.171 --> 02:03:20.674]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:03:20.914 --> 02:03:28.020]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:29.642]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.00.

[02:03:47.395 --> 02:03:47.876]  It's here!
[02:03:48.116 --> 02:03:52.864]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:53.264 --> 02:04:00.896]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:01.593 --> 02:04:08.636]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.036 --> 02:04:20.461]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:20.781 --> 02:04:24.443]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:24.743 --> 02:04:26.684]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.004 --> 02:04:30.846]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:44.091 --> 02:04:51.557]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry, and I'm a plastic surgeon, and I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.
[02:04:51.717 --> 02:04:54.219]  But I want to tell you today about a product that I developed.
[02:04:54.279 --> 02:05:00.444]  It's called Night Skin, and it helps your skin look younger without needles, without acid peels, and without a facelift.
[02:05:00.664 --> 02:05:03.806]  In 12 hours, it will make your skin seem smoother.
[02:05:04.006 --> 02:05:06.468]  In 12 hours, it will stimulate collagen production.
[02:05:06.728 --> 02:05:09.991]  And in 12 hours, it will promote elastin growth in your skin.
[02:05:10.251 --> 02:05:11.012]  What does this all mean?
[02:05:11.272 --> 02:05:15.656]  Well, this is the stuff that makes your skin firm and healthy, and helps you look younger.
[02:05:15.937 --> 02:05:25.086]  Night Skin is real, and the results are real, and it contains only proven ingredients that work to lighten age spots, smooth the skin, and help diminish the appearance of wrinkles.
[02:05:25.386 --> 02:05:28.028]  It's easy, and in 12 hours, you'll see it works.
[02:05:28.249 --> 02:05:29.590]  Try it risk-free today.
[02:05:29.810 --> 02:05:32.112]  To order Nightskin wrist-free, call 1-800-894-3462.
[02:05:32.132 --> 02:05:34.413]  Learn how to get a free bottle by responding to this ad.
[02:05:34.714 --> 02:05:34.934]  Call 1-800-894-3462.
[02:05:34.954 --> 02:05:35.154]  That's 1-800-894-3462.
[02:05:35.174 --> 02:05:36.135]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:36.155 --> 02:05:37.576]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.758 --> 02:05:57.561]  Yeah, the T-Rex is sitting in an airport in New York coming to town.
[02:05:57.581 --> 02:05:58.462]  I've come back to Austin.
[02:05:58.482 --> 02:06:02.425]  He'll be back live in studio tomorrow.
[02:06:02.445 --> 02:06:16.037]  And that'll be good because I can go back to selling hardware over at Spicewood Springs Road at 183 here in Austin and y'all can come buy my Alex Jones videos from me and pick up a Ron Paul for President sign or two while you're there and chew the fat.
[02:06:16.677 --> 02:06:19.780]  My store is kind of like the politically incorrect Central of Austin.
[02:06:20.555 --> 02:06:25.617]  Because of my TV show and because of my association with Alex Jones.
[02:06:26.377 --> 02:06:29.238]  Okay, we've got John in Washington.
[02:06:29.258 --> 02:06:30.318]  He's been waiting for a long time.
[02:06:30.378 --> 02:06:31.379]  John, are you still there?
[02:06:31.999 --> 02:06:32.399]  You bet.
[02:06:32.659 --> 02:06:33.279]  Alright, John.
[02:06:33.319 --> 02:06:36.720]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, worldwide and nationwide.
[02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:37.341]  What's going on?
[02:06:37.961 --> 02:06:38.781]  Nice job, Bob.
[02:06:38.841 --> 02:06:41.382]  I've enjoyed listening to you the last few days.
[02:06:41.482 --> 02:06:41.822]  Thank you.
[02:06:42.422 --> 02:06:47.784]  I have something that I have not heard anyone bring up or bring to light.
[02:06:49.102 --> 02:06:55.805]  And that is a fellow named Ron Suskind has written a book called The Price of Loyalty.
[02:06:55.905 --> 02:06:56.845]  Have you heard of that?
[02:06:57.065 --> 02:06:57.665]  No, I have not.
[02:06:57.725 --> 02:06:59.346]  Give us the bottom line of that.
[02:06:59.606 --> 02:07:14.251]  Well, he was interviewed by 60 Minutes and during the course of the interview, he divulged that he had interviewed a great number of advisors, staff members, so forth, in the White House and amongst those
[02:07:14.904 --> 02:07:21.306]  Was Paul O'Neill, you know who he is, the former Secretary of the Treasury.
[02:07:22.346 --> 02:07:42.533]  And so he showed the documents, the actual documents, and Paul O'Neill went on record as saying that at the very first meeting of the National Security Council that George Bush identified
[02:07:43.001 --> 02:07:46.404]  Saddam Hussein said that they had to take him out.
[02:07:47.204 --> 02:08:00.454]  They also went on to, apparently at the second meeting, he got somewhat perturbed and he demanded that they bring him a way to make it happen.
[02:08:00.514 --> 02:08:02.316]  That's exactly how he put it.
[02:08:02.856 --> 02:08:08.060]  They also showed documents from the Pentagon of oil maps
[02:08:09.022 --> 02:08:36.352]  that are likely areas for exploration for oil in Iran and a list of suitors or would-be customers or drilling corporations from all over the world a shopping list if you will of people to come in to post Saddam Iraq and people with whom our government intends to set up I suppose
[02:08:37.281 --> 02:08:39.022]  Drilling leases and so forth.
[02:08:39.122 --> 02:08:43.543]  So, right from the very minute, I mean, this is very important.
[02:08:43.883 --> 02:08:56.207]  You've got Paul O'Neill and Pentagon documents and classified secret documents that he provided to this Ron Susskind.
[02:08:57.007 --> 02:09:01.389]  And I mean, literally, as far as I can tell, this pretty much blows it wide open.
[02:09:01.449 --> 02:09:04.910]  This is the deep throat that everybody's been waiting on.
[02:09:06.226 --> 02:09:12.129]  To that end, 60 Minutes buried the interview and buried the film.
[02:09:12.549 --> 02:09:15.371]  However, someone got a copy of it out.
[02:09:15.711 --> 02:09:17.271]  Now it's up on YouTube.
[02:09:17.672 --> 02:09:18.032]  Really?
[02:09:18.052 --> 02:09:24.915]  You can go to YouTube and type into your search engine, and this is what you'll type in.
[02:09:25.275 --> 02:09:30.258]  A buried 60 Minutes interview slash indictment.
[02:09:30.990 --> 02:09:34.532]  This thing will blow your mind, but it is the smoking gun.
[02:09:34.992 --> 02:09:38.593]  Okay, that's a buried 60 minute interview slash indictment.
[02:09:39.414 --> 02:09:39.654]  Yes.
[02:09:39.994 --> 02:09:43.516]  And that's on YouTube and Ron Susskind?
[02:09:44.096 --> 02:09:49.518]  Ron Susskind is the author of the book and the name of the book is The Price of Loyalty.
[02:09:50.099 --> 02:09:52.940]  Here's something else that will pop your cork too.
[02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:59.943]  Rumsfeld found out, and Paul O'Neill said this, and it was backed up by Susskind.
[02:10:00.709 --> 02:10:13.179]  Um, that when they, when Donald Rumsfeld found out about the book, that the book was being written, and he called O'Neill and told him, do not do the book.
[02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:23.347]  Well, we don't want to be doing the book because that shows gigantic, massive premeditation of no matter what happens, we're going to war to steal the oil.
[02:10:23.648 --> 02:10:30.193]  Well, if you remember on the inauguration, at the debates and at the inauguration and so forth, remember how Bush harped on this idea
[02:10:30.689 --> 02:10:32.309]  of a non-interventionist government.
[02:10:32.349 --> 02:10:33.790]  We must not do nation building.
[02:10:33.850 --> 02:10:35.830]  It's going to be trouble coming down the road.
[02:10:35.850 --> 02:10:37.091]  Well, that's how I got elected.
[02:10:37.451 --> 02:10:38.471]  Yeah, that's how I got elected.
[02:10:38.871 --> 02:10:48.214]  He had this plan drawn up for a fact mount and the plan and the shopping list of people and the Pentagon documents.
[02:10:48.574 --> 02:10:56.456]  All of this was handed out at the very first National Security Council meeting and the second meeting.
[02:10:57.123 --> 02:11:01.649]  And that is, we're talking about what, seven months, eight months before 9-11?
[02:11:02.530 --> 02:11:08.899]  Yeah, so what we're talking about is the first time they get together and says, okay boys, we got the reins down, now here's the battle plan.
[02:11:09.594 --> 02:11:10.734]  We're going to go after Iraq.
[02:11:10.754 --> 02:11:11.814]  We're going to steal their oil.
[02:11:11.855 --> 02:11:13.915]  These guys want this contract.
[02:11:14.055 --> 02:11:15.335]  Here's a good place to drill for oil.
[02:11:15.915 --> 02:11:21.957]  These guys have a contract here, but we can get rid of the Russians over here and probably the French guys over here because they're supporting the wrong guy.
[02:11:21.997 --> 02:11:23.297]  We're going to take this over.
[02:11:23.317 --> 02:11:24.917]  That's what they were doing back then.
[02:11:25.017 --> 02:11:32.559]  The important thing was that he demanded that these people at the council meeting find him a way to make it happen.
[02:11:34.329 --> 02:11:39.653]  That sounds a lot like the document from the British, what was that called?
[02:11:40.634 --> 02:11:46.377]  The Downing Street Memo to justify the war, to make the facts fit what they wanted to do.
[02:11:47.018 --> 02:11:47.938]  You bet, you bet.
[02:11:47.978 --> 02:11:52.361]  But I think that you're really going to enjoy this video and I'm kind of surprised.
[02:11:53.482 --> 02:11:54.783]  I'll tell you how I found it.
[02:11:56.024 --> 02:11:58.305]  I was digging for Ron Paul information.
[02:11:58.325 --> 02:11:59.306]  Is that right?
[02:11:59.346 --> 02:12:02.448]  You know there's thousands of Ron Paul videos and I was doing that.
[02:12:03.212 --> 02:12:20.375]  And apparently somebody in the Ron Paul camp got or had access to this and they used this film and then at the end of it they tacked on a vote for Ron Paul type of a deal.
[02:12:20.415 --> 02:12:23.656]  So this film was actually kind of buried in the Ron Paul vault.
[02:12:24.896 --> 02:12:27.796]  It was a quashed 60 minute interview.
[02:12:27.816 --> 02:12:30.457]  Tell us one more time because people like to repeat stuff.
[02:12:30.637 --> 02:12:31.757]  A buried what?
[02:12:32.541 --> 02:12:37.782]  A buried 60 minute interview slash indictment.
[02:12:39.102 --> 02:12:42.003]  Okay, a buried 60 minute interview slash indictment.
[02:12:42.043 --> 02:12:43.423]  Type that into YouTube.
[02:12:44.143 --> 02:12:47.004]  Yeah, go to the YouTube, put it in the search engine and it will pop up.
[02:12:48.364 --> 02:12:49.784]  That will be fun.
[02:12:50.084 --> 02:12:53.105]  You could also put in 60 minutes.
[02:12:53.225 --> 02:12:58.506]  If it doesn't come right up or you have trouble, you've got the names Ron Suskind and the price of loyalty.
[02:12:59.006 --> 02:12:59.786]  Right, you'll find it.
[02:13:00.236 --> 02:13:01.737]  Those things you'll be able to find it.
[02:13:01.817 --> 02:13:12.063]  I can even shoot an email over and here's something else that I'm doing that I suggest other people do is that on your email you have a signature option most of the time.
[02:13:12.103 --> 02:13:17.747]  I've got an InfoWars email account so on my signature option I put in there so
[02:13:18.487 --> 02:13:24.513]  You still think that the war is about terrorism and then I put the YouTube link under it for my signature.
[02:13:35.928 --> 02:13:42.414]  Add another number to this monstrous list of smoking guns about what September 11th was really all about.
[02:13:43.234 --> 02:13:51.802]  I'd heard things about Cheney passing out the map of where all the oil was to his oil buddies and they had a list of all the current contracts.
[02:13:52.546 --> 02:13:58.129]  And, you know, who was going to get the contracts and who was going to get kicked out because they didn't support the war?
[02:13:58.589 --> 02:14:00.750]  I know the Russians were going, hey, wait a minute, we got contracts.
[02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:03.571]  And I think the French were going, hey, hey, wait a minute, we got all contracts.
[02:14:03.611 --> 02:14:04.412]  Well, too bad.
[02:14:04.432 --> 02:14:08.994]  We're going to bash you French guys in the mainstream media and y'all are going to be just toast.
[02:14:09.554 --> 02:14:10.875]  And who cares about the Russians?
[02:14:11.395 --> 02:14:12.756]  But I remember that part.
[02:14:12.856 --> 02:14:15.917]  But this sounds like it's much more detailed.
[02:14:16.417 --> 02:14:19.359]  And if some of this is coming from the Secretary of the Treasury,
[02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:20.740]  Paul O'Neill.
[02:14:20.820 --> 02:14:21.721]  Hey, let's check it out.
[02:14:22.161 --> 02:14:23.341]  Okay, good enough.
[02:14:23.802 --> 02:14:26.903]  We've got Larry from Indiana up next.
[02:14:27.043 --> 02:14:27.783]  Larry, are you there?
[02:14:27.803 --> 02:14:29.164]  Hello, Bob.
[02:14:29.564 --> 02:14:31.464]  How are you going to top John from Washington?
[02:14:31.485 --> 02:14:33.585]  How are you going to do that?
[02:14:33.605 --> 02:14:39.588]  Hey, I'm a Republican Vice Precinct Committee person here in Owen County, Indiana, and I'm pushing Ron Paul.
[02:14:39.708 --> 02:14:41.288]  I've just had a question or two here.
[02:14:41.448 --> 02:14:42.109]  Heresy!
[02:14:42.289 --> 02:14:44.169]  Go ahead.
[02:14:44.590 --> 02:14:47.051]  If you take all this information, I mean, when we had 9-11, we
[02:14:48.697 --> 02:14:55.020]  We had a story of six Israelis wearing Arab gear, videotaping the tower, coming down and dancing, laughing about it.
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:03.744]  We had a Fox News story about, you know, a telephone company, Israeli telephone company, doing spying on everybody in this country.
[02:15:05.145 --> 02:15:09.967]  We had 3,000 Israelis that were warned via instant messages that were not at work on that day.
[02:15:10.563 --> 02:15:12.224]  Yeah, a lot of people were warned.
[02:15:12.244 --> 02:15:19.846]  I mean, there were several government agencies that got wind of it, and they were warning us about what was going to happen, that there was going to be an imminent attack.
[02:15:20.526 --> 02:15:22.307]  And even some of them got real specific.
[02:15:22.427 --> 02:15:24.347]  I mean, you know, it wasn't just the Israelis.
[02:15:24.447 --> 02:15:25.588]  It was a lot of people.
[02:15:25.868 --> 02:15:34.250]  Yeah, but I mean, what can you say about a group that, you know, gets these warnings and doesn't tell anybody else, just quietly doesn't show up for work the next day and allows this to happen?
[02:15:34.671 --> 02:15:38.552]  And you've got Larry Silverstein, who's a... You know, just... Hey, listen to this for just a second.
[02:15:38.572 --> 02:15:39.152]  Tell me what you're saying.
[02:15:39.537 --> 02:15:44.158]  Larry Silverstein is a rabid Zionist, you know, who's involved in the complicity of bringing down Building 7.
[02:15:44.478 --> 02:15:49.139]  These charges had to be placed in these towers in Building 7 weeks before.
[02:15:49.699 --> 02:15:55.140]  And by the way, it's been reported that Flight 93 was supposedly going to target Building 7.
[02:15:55.180 --> 02:15:58.641]  They wanted to take out the FEMA CIA spooks and kooks.
[02:15:58.661 --> 02:16:00.741]  This is the black shirts taking out the brown shirts.
[02:16:01.521 --> 02:16:06.142]  I think that that's a very distinct possibility, what you just said.
[02:16:07.194 --> 02:16:08.295]  I don't like to speculate.
[02:16:09.015 --> 02:16:10.756]  I'm almost allergic to speculating.
[02:16:11.216 --> 02:16:18.460]  But in that particular case, you've got three buildings, three planes, and one plane didn't make it.
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:22.262]  I don't know if it was 93, but one plane didn't make it to New York.
[02:16:22.422 --> 02:16:23.523]  I believe that sincerely.
[02:16:23.583 --> 02:16:30.706]  Because you can't have that building left standing when people are going to go in there and find out it's been wired to blow.
[02:16:30.927 --> 02:16:31.907]  You just can't have that.
[02:16:32.027 --> 02:16:33.508]  That's unacceptable.
[02:16:33.528 --> 02:16:34.709]  So they had to concoct this
[02:16:35.669 --> 02:16:39.692]  This story about why I came down as an excuse to blow it up.
[02:16:40.152 --> 02:16:45.315]  But yeah, I think very definitely, I think you're right, I think one plane that was intended for New York never got there.
[02:16:45.935 --> 02:16:52.600]  If you have a chance, take a look at a website, and listeners should look at this, realnews247.com.
[02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:54.020]  Jim Condit Jr.
[02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:56.462]  out of Ohio has orchestrated this site.
[02:16:56.482 --> 02:16:58.103]  A ton of material here.
[02:16:58.703 --> 02:17:00.865]  Look at the people in the Bush administration, Bob.
[02:17:00.945 --> 02:17:02.926]  Wolfowitz, Pearl, Larry Abrams,
[02:17:03.413 --> 02:17:05.114]  Douglas Fee, Chertoff.
[02:17:05.134 --> 02:17:14.778]  I have no doubt at all that the Zionists faction was deeply involved in September 11th.
[02:17:14.818 --> 02:17:21.261]  What I object to is when people take a broad brush and paint all the Jews and say that they're the ones.
[02:17:21.301 --> 02:17:22.062]  I agree with you.
[02:17:22.202 --> 02:17:22.922]  I agree with you.
[02:17:23.542 --> 02:17:27.324]  And that is used, the anti-Semitic line is used to smoke screen this.
[02:17:27.624 --> 02:17:29.325]  That is a tool of the Zionists.
[02:17:29.895 --> 02:17:36.406]  There's a big difference between those who believe in the Bible, the Torah, and the ideology called the Talmud.
[02:17:37.128 --> 02:17:38.350]  Burial, I'm going to hold you over.
[02:17:45.188 --> 02:17:49.789]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[02:17:49.989 --> 02:17:54.431]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[02:17:54.611 --> 02:18:08.635]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey Light Water Purifier, an LED Base, two Berkey Sport Filtration Bottles, the Berkey Battery Adapter, the Berkey MP Solar Charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:18:08.855 --> 02:18:28.062]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.
[02:18:28.282 --> 02:18:31.884]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[02:18:32.044 --> 02:18:34.725]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[02:18:40.348 --> 02:18:47.092]  This is a market alert from Midas Resources.
[02:18:47.472 --> 02:18:57.458]  Since August 9th, the Fed has created and injected $200 billion into the financial markets to keep them afloat, ignoring the hyperinflationary hangover that is the sure result.
[02:18:57.959 --> 02:19:03.482]  Data released by the New York Federal Reserve shows that foreign central banks have cut their stash of U.S.
[02:19:03.542 --> 02:19:06.344]  Treasuries by $48 billion since late July.
[02:19:07.193 --> 02:19:10.215]  With falls of 32 billion in the last two weeks alone.
[02:19:10.715 --> 02:19:12.756]  Could China be quietly dumping the dollar?
[02:19:13.677 --> 02:19:16.639]  The quality of your life depends on the quality of your currency.
[02:19:16.859 --> 02:19:18.840]  And the quality of the dollar is poor.
[02:19:19.060 --> 02:19:20.781]  Because the quantity is so high.
[02:19:21.162 --> 02:19:24.003]  Printing money out of thin air has disastrous results.
[02:19:24.143 --> 02:19:26.965]  Victimizing middle class citizens and discouraging savings.
[02:19:27.505 --> 02:19:32.008]  If you have been considering precious metals as a hedge against inflation, you need to act now.
[02:19:32.428 --> 02:19:34.970]  Procrastination is the mother of lost opportunities.
[02:19:35.450 --> 02:19:37.052]  Call me, Tom Andrew at 1-800-606-1294.
[02:19:37.092 --> 02:19:37.353]  That's 1-800-606-1294.
[02:19:44.696 --> 02:19:49.638]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:19:49.958 --> 02:19:51.838]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:19:52.018 --> 02:19:55.059]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:19:55.239 --> 02:19:58.400]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:19:58.680 --> 02:20:00.561]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[02:20:00.821 --> 02:20:04.522]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:20:04.802 --> 02:20:07.463]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:20:07.483 --> 02:20:10.764]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy.
[02:20:11.004 --> 02:20:16.869]  And you do well if you take heed, but first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:20:17.269 --> 02:20:21.613]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[02:20:21.914 --> 02:20:26.177]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[02:20:26.498 --> 02:20:29.160]  You will receive information regarding America and prophecy.
[02:20:29.400 --> 02:20:32.364]  Tyrants and Wars, The New World Order, and much more.
[02:20:32.665 --> 02:20:35.108]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[02:20:35.308 --> 02:20:35.809]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:20:35.829 --> 02:20:36.330]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:20:36.350 --> 02:20:36.931]  And ask for Packet B.
[02:20:46.334 --> 02:20:50.397]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[02:20:51.157 --> 02:20:59.023]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Border, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[02:20:59.503 --> 02:21:11.611]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[02:21:11.691 --> 02:21:12.191]  Central.
[02:21:12.592 --> 02:21:14.473]  Formidable Alex Jones says,
[02:21:15.217 --> 02:21:18.938]  This is a network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[02:21:19.618 --> 02:21:25.960]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[02:21:26.500 --> 02:21:31.582]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[02:21:32.322 --> 02:21:37.824]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[02:21:38.224 --> 02:21:39.604]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[02:21:39.684 --> 02:21:41.725]  Central with The Divided Kingdom.
[02:21:56.026 --> 02:21:57.447]  Is it getting better?
[02:22:00.889 --> 02:22:02.710]  Or do you feel the same?
[02:22:06.232 --> 02:22:08.653]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[02:22:08.813 --> 02:22:12.675]  You've got someone to blame.
[02:22:12.696 --> 02:22:16.978]  Alright, this is Bob Gracy back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:17.118 --> 02:22:18.479]  Today is September the 12th.
[02:22:19.617 --> 02:22:33.941]  And we have Larry on the line still holding over from the last break, and Larry has been telling us about checking out a video on YouTube about a buried 60 Minutes indictment.
[02:22:34.281 --> 02:22:35.422]  So y'all need to check that out.
[02:22:35.722 --> 02:22:38.022]  Larry, you have anything else you want to add before we go to the next caller?
[02:22:38.662 --> 02:22:42.664]  That was your previous caller, and I suggested RealNews247.com.
[02:22:42.904 --> 02:22:43.424]  I'm sorry.
[02:22:43.504 --> 02:22:44.264]  I screwed up there.
[02:22:44.304 --> 02:22:45.324]  That's right.
[02:22:45.464 --> 02:22:46.345]  RealNews247.com.
[02:22:46.385 --> 02:22:46.825]  That's right.
[02:22:46.845 --> 02:22:47.545]  That was John.
[02:22:48.496 --> 02:22:49.917]  Gotta read my notes here better.
[02:22:50.277 --> 02:22:55.640]  Zionists, you know, I heard Alex talking about Albert Pike, you know, planning three world wars.
[02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:58.101]  Third will be between the political Zionists and the Arabs.
[02:22:58.741 --> 02:23:01.143]  Big difference between the Zionists and the real Jews.
[02:23:01.583 --> 02:23:07.246]  The key is what is called the Talmud, T-A-L-M-U-D, which is a satanic doctrine, Bob.
[02:23:07.826 --> 02:23:08.547]  Check that out.
[02:23:09.947 --> 02:23:15.030]  But my God, man, we've got the same people running the homeland Gestapo now.
[02:23:15.666 --> 02:23:18.126]  that are in charge of the KGB in Russia.
[02:23:18.266 --> 02:23:23.167]  The same ideology that killed 66 million there are now in charge here.
[02:23:23.687 --> 02:23:25.168]  It is more than fair game.
[02:23:25.288 --> 02:23:31.729]  If we're going to hit a bullseye, we've got to get this information out on the Zionism and, you know, these people in key positions here.
[02:23:32.209 --> 02:23:35.710]  That's been kind of squelched, even at this network, Bob.
[02:23:35.730 --> 02:23:39.670]  You know, I was out doing this in 2003, Lawson at iEndeavor.com
[02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:47.174]  I was doing a Mark Kearnkey Show here on this network when we were attacked.
[02:23:47.614 --> 02:23:52.339]  We're talking about who stands to gain from these attacks, 9-11 attacks.
[02:23:52.399 --> 02:23:53.881]  People call in and say Israel.
[02:23:53.921 --> 02:23:55.883]  They were always squelched, Bob.
[02:23:56.784 --> 02:23:59.647]  I'll tell you something, Larry.
[02:24:00.068 --> 02:24:03.772]  The thing I always have a problem with is, again, the broad brush.
[02:24:04.597 --> 02:24:13.213]  People think that, you know, the Jews are all together in some, like they're all hooked up on some computer and they all think just alike and everything.
[02:24:13.937 --> 02:24:16.878]  And again, Zionism is one thing.
[02:24:17.338 --> 02:24:19.318]  Being Jewish is not the same thing.
[02:24:19.358 --> 02:24:30.521]  And I think that all that ancient history stuff about the Talmud, if these people are following it and all that stuff, I think it really goes over a lot of people's heads.
[02:24:30.961 --> 02:24:34.221]  What matters is to go after the perps regardless of who they are.
[02:24:34.581 --> 02:24:35.562]  Larry, thank you for the call.
[02:24:35.582 --> 02:24:37.162]  I appreciate it.
[02:24:37.242 --> 02:24:40.923]  We've got James in New York still holding, I hope.
[02:24:41.023 --> 02:24:41.683]  James, are you there?
[02:24:44.133 --> 02:24:45.033]  James in New York.
[02:24:45.373 --> 02:24:45.853]  Is he gone?
[02:24:47.894 --> 02:24:48.514]  Sorry about that.
[02:24:48.554 --> 02:24:49.054]  I had to unmute.
[02:24:49.074 --> 02:24:49.754]  How are you doing, sir?
[02:24:49.994 --> 02:24:50.994]  Yeah, James, you there?
[02:24:51.554 --> 02:24:51.914]  Yes, sir.
[02:24:52.094 --> 02:24:52.454]  Thank you.
[02:24:52.935 --> 02:24:53.955]  You've been holding a while.
[02:24:54.455 --> 02:24:55.475]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:55.495 --> 02:24:58.015]  You're live right now, so I hope it's worth the wait.
[02:24:58.035 --> 02:24:58.596]  What's going on?
[02:24:59.376 --> 02:25:01.156]  I just wanted to give a call.
[02:25:01.176 --> 02:25:02.736]  I was actually being in New York.
[02:25:02.816 --> 02:25:06.357]  I was able to go to the We Are Change event.
[02:25:07.037 --> 02:25:09.337]  I had the pleasure of viewing Endgame.
[02:25:09.698 --> 02:25:12.238]  It was a really powerful, tremendous film.
[02:25:13.926 --> 02:25:16.367]  Best Alex Jones work to date.
[02:25:17.528 --> 02:25:23.070]  I was also able to see the rough cut of Loose Change.
[02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:27.611]  It was always a great film, but it's much better now.
[02:25:27.811 --> 02:25:32.953]  I think it's probably the best 9-11 truth film out there.
[02:25:33.934 --> 02:25:36.235]  So you really like Loose Change, huh?
[02:25:36.995 --> 02:25:38.575]  Yeah, it was really good.
[02:25:40.871 --> 02:25:42.373]  Quite different from the other versions.
[02:25:42.793 --> 02:25:46.237]  You say the accuracy level went up or something.
[02:25:46.497 --> 02:25:47.038]  What do you think?
[02:25:47.458 --> 02:25:58.510]  Well, what I think is that they tried to stay away from some of the things that the quote-unquote debunkers out there would like to try to poke holes in.
[02:25:58.550 --> 02:26:03.054]  They basically went a little bit of a different direction with things that were more
[02:26:04.127 --> 02:26:09.729]  You know, using news clips and using actual audio and video from the day, things that you really can't debunk.
[02:26:11.070 --> 02:26:16.572]  It's kind of hard to debunk the fact that the 9-1-1 Commission blew off the money trail.
[02:26:17.132 --> 02:26:18.833]  That's impossible to debunk that.
[02:26:18.873 --> 02:26:22.774]  It's also impossible to debunk the 9-1-1 Commission blowing off Building 7.
[02:26:23.215 --> 02:26:24.115]  You can't debunk that.
[02:26:24.611 --> 02:26:26.352]  Well, yeah, that was another thing I wanted to bring up.
[02:26:26.432 --> 02:26:31.957]  I mean, first of all, Keane says that there was no loss of life in that building.
[02:26:32.017 --> 02:26:34.078]  That may or may not be true.
[02:26:34.699 --> 02:26:35.680]  You know, I wasn't there.
[02:26:36.720 --> 02:26:45.727]  According to Barry Jennings, the Director of Emergency Management Services for the Housing Division of the City of New York, there were dead bodies in the lobby of Building 7.
[02:26:46.741 --> 02:26:50.163]  In the morning, before the two towers collapsed.
[02:26:50.583 --> 02:26:53.884]  So... I'm sure that that's the case, but the bottom line is this.
[02:26:54.004 --> 02:27:00.707]  I mean, this person basically said, due to the fact there was no live loss, they didn't pay any attention to that.
[02:27:01.068 --> 02:27:05.169]  Well, what about the millions of people that live and work in New York City in high-rise buildings?
[02:27:05.610 --> 02:27:05.730]  Yeah.
[02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:15.034]  If there's some localized fires in one of them, you know, those buildings, and they collapse... Yeah, if they're that poorly constructed, we all got a big problem, don't we?
[02:27:15.726 --> 02:27:17.547]  James, let me hold you over to the break.
[02:27:17.567 --> 02:27:33.551]  We've got another break here coming up, and we'll be back here on the Alex Jones Show with James from New York, right after these commercial announcements.
[02:27:34.872 --> 02:27:35.812]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.832 --> 02:27:37.893]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.773 --> 02:27:41.494]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.844 --> 02:27:46.806]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[02:27:47.066 --> 02:27:50.109]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[02:27:50.369 --> 02:27:55.174]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[02:27:55.474 --> 02:27:58.216]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[02:27:58.457 --> 02:28:03.141]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[02:28:03.421 --> 02:28:05.323]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[02:28:05.803 --> 02:28:15.749]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[02:28:16.129 --> 02:28:20.811]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[02:28:21.191 --> 02:28:24.713]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[02:28:24.933 --> 02:28:27.075]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[02:28:27.395 --> 02:28:29.536]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings,
[02:28:29.716 --> 02:28:31.518]  We'll even refund the shipping charge.
[02:28:31.818 --> 02:28:34.922]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[02:28:35.162 --> 02:28:36.043]  What are you waiting for?
[02:28:36.243 --> 02:28:36.924]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[02:28:37.144 --> 02:28:37.344]  That's 1-888-873-7371.
[02:28:37.364 --> 02:28:37.525]  Today!
[02:28:44.835 --> 02:28:47.096]  Are you in sales or do you own your own business?
[02:28:47.556 --> 02:28:49.157]  If so, I want you to think of a number.
[02:28:49.497 --> 02:28:51.679]  Think of the amount of money you'd like to make this year.
[02:28:52.019 --> 02:28:52.499]  You have it?
[02:28:52.779 --> 02:28:54.040]  Okay, so what's stopping you?
[02:28:54.300 --> 02:28:55.240]  It's not your drive.
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:28:56.461]  It's not your skills.
[02:28:56.801 --> 02:28:59.462]  Chances are it's your ability to find new leads.
[02:28:59.783 --> 02:29:00.503]  It's not easy.
[02:29:00.503 --> 02:29:00.643]  Really?
[02:29:00.823 --> 02:29:03.045]  But what if someone had already done the work for you?
[02:29:03.325 --> 02:29:10.311]  What if, with one phone call, you could get your hands on as many new sales leads as you could handle and actually make that number you have in your head?
[02:29:10.671 --> 02:29:12.113]  It's not too good to be true.
[02:29:12.393 --> 02:29:18.278]  It's Sales Genie, the largest provider of the most up-to-date sales leads mailing lists and business credit reports.
[02:29:18.478 --> 02:29:21.700]  And they want to give you 100 sales leads absolutely free.
[02:29:22.001 --> 02:29:26.084]  No matter what you're selling or who you're selling to, Sales Genie has the sales leads
[02:29:26.144 --> 02:29:26.685]  I think so.
[02:29:44.910 --> 02:29:47.291]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[02:29:47.812 --> 02:29:49.292]  After a pedicure, they look great.
[02:29:49.633 --> 02:29:53.475]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[02:29:53.915 --> 02:29:56.096]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[02:29:56.536 --> 02:29:59.878]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[02:30:00.279 --> 02:30:02.740]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[02:30:03.240 --> 02:30:04.281]  What's that name again?
[02:30:04.681 --> 02:30:05.862]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[02:30:06.242 --> 02:30:07.402]  It's CalX.
[02:30:07.823 --> 02:30:09.664]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[02:30:10.004 --> 02:30:11.865]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[02:30:12.637 --> 02:30:21.239]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[02:30:21.679 --> 02:30:27.401]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[02:30:27.781 --> 02:30:38.904]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[02:30:39.582 --> 02:30:40.683]  Hey, here's a drugstore.
[02:30:41.004 --> 02:30:41.685]  I'll be right back.
[02:30:41.805 --> 02:30:43.547]  I'm getting some callots for my heels.
[02:30:45.009 --> 02:30:49.174]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[02:30:59.493 --> 02:31:07.619]  Okay, this is Bob Basie back on the Alex Jones Show in the last half of the last
[02:31:26.576 --> 02:31:29.096]  Hour of the Show, that's a funny song.
[02:31:29.637 --> 02:31:31.837]  However, I'm afraid you can't get away with that.
[02:31:31.877 --> 02:31:36.558]  You try to sneak into Mexico and they do not treat you very well.
[02:31:37.118 --> 02:31:39.438]  However, if you sneak out, hey, everything's cool.
[02:31:40.258 --> 02:31:41.879]  We've been talking to James in New York.
[02:31:41.899 --> 02:31:44.339]  James, what else do you have to add to our conversation today?
[02:31:44.359 --> 02:31:48.720]  Well, the bottom line is it's clear that everybody is lying about this.
[02:31:48.900 --> 02:31:55.281]  I mean, the joke that we have for media, the whole government, everybody has blood on their hands it seems.
[02:31:56.014 --> 02:32:05.120]  And I think it's gone too far to the point where, you know, it's going to be really tough for anybody even to come out and say, you know, that the official story was a lie.
[02:32:05.560 --> 02:32:21.831]  I mean, let's say even if what, if Building 7, due to the fact that, uh, you know, the CIA and other offices that were in there, uh, let's say the building was wired to, uh, to come down in case of, uh, uh, you know, something like this, uh, was to happen just for national security.
[02:32:22.432 --> 02:32:25.294]  Why couldn't that even be admitted in the first place?
[02:32:25.634 --> 02:32:26.775]  Yeah, there are a bunch of lies.
[02:32:26.835 --> 02:32:29.477]  Why would they just lie about it and cover it all up?
[02:32:29.537 --> 02:32:30.938]  I mean, none of it makes sense.
[02:32:30.998 --> 02:32:43.607]  I mean, anybody with eyes could see that the building came down in such a way that, I mean, there's 80-something columns that were holding up that building from the vault to collapse at once due to fire.
[02:32:43.627 --> 02:32:44.928]  I mean, that doesn't make sense.
[02:32:45.508 --> 02:32:48.770]  Why would demolition companies even bother putting explosives in a building?
[02:32:48.790 --> 02:32:51.012]  All they have to do is light some fires for it to come down like that.
[02:32:51.423 --> 02:32:55.546]  Yeah, or anything that flies in the face of any kind of reality.
[02:32:56.226 --> 02:33:02.370]  Somebody needs to tell that to those guys over at Fox News because they debunked everything about September 11th in three minutes on that show.
[02:33:02.390 --> 02:33:03.030]  Oh yeah, of course they did.
[02:33:03.230 --> 02:33:04.151]  On Fox and Friends.
[02:33:04.211 --> 02:33:04.551]  They did.
[02:33:04.571 --> 02:33:05.972]  I mean, I saw the clip.
[02:33:07.213 --> 02:33:11.215]  I felt like I was walking underneath the door without opening the door after that.
[02:33:11.235 --> 02:33:15.918]  I thought all of my arguments had been blown away by Fox News in three minutes.
[02:33:16.747 --> 02:33:27.936]  It's a joke, and I'm sure you've seen the video with Geraldo with his remarks that he's making about the guys that were demonstrating, calling them whatever names.
[02:33:28.256 --> 02:33:30.798]  There's a professional journalist for you there.
[02:33:31.339 --> 02:33:31.879]  It's a joke.
[02:33:32.359 --> 02:33:44.069]  Unfortunately, it seems that a large portion of our society just would rather sleepwalk through life instead of taking any ownership or any responsibility for
[02:33:44.702 --> 02:33:47.245]  For the world that they live in, they'd rather not know.
[02:33:48.966 --> 02:33:53.351]  This is a tough thing, but the thing is, our side is winning this.
[02:33:53.651 --> 02:33:58.396]  Every year, more and more people have woken up to the fact that the government is lying about September 11th.
[02:33:58.636 --> 02:33:59.337]  Every year.
[02:34:00.057 --> 02:34:05.723]  I'm sure that the release of all this loose change is going to come.
[02:34:05.783 --> 02:34:07.505]  Right now, it's not completely finished yet.
[02:34:08.115 --> 02:34:13.479]  But when they get it done and it's a sequel to the most watched film ever on the internet.
[02:34:13.519 --> 02:34:16.081]  The first blockbuster on the internet was Loose Change.
[02:34:16.101 --> 02:34:16.682]  That's what they say.
[02:34:17.162 --> 02:34:18.203]  What did they say?
[02:34:18.223 --> 02:34:19.564]  200 million people have viewed it?
[02:34:20.065 --> 02:34:21.966]  I mean this is going to be the sequel to it.
[02:34:22.507 --> 02:34:25.249]  And this one Alex Jones is involved in.
[02:34:26.085 --> 02:34:31.388]  With a lot more money, and a lot more research, and a lot more, you know, accuracy.
[02:34:31.909 --> 02:34:35.411]  And so, I am, you know, we're getting these people.
[02:34:35.451 --> 02:34:45.777]  And I look forward to the day when there's some people arrested, you know, grand juries are impaneled, indictments are handed out, and trials happen.
[02:34:46.177 --> 02:34:50.119]  I'm looking forward to that day, because... Yeah, well that would be, you know, ideal.
[02:34:50.219 --> 02:34:51.500]  But, you know, it's tough.
[02:34:51.580 --> 02:34:54.502]  I mean, you can show people evidence, and if they're not ready to believe it,
[02:34:55.397 --> 02:34:56.598]  Uh, they're just not going to believe it.
[02:34:56.659 --> 02:35:08.530]  You know, I have family members that are, you know, police officers and, and, you know, my, my, uh, my dad worked the pile and I had a cousin that was lost in, uh, in, uh, World Trade to work for Kenneth Fitzgerald.
[02:35:08.770 --> 02:35:10.592]  And, uh, you know, it's tough.
[02:35:10.672 --> 02:35:18.660]  I mean, it's a, it's a, it's a tough thing to, you know, we know the truth and we know what's what, but it's really tough to, uh, convince people cause they just don't
[02:35:19.617 --> 02:35:22.319]  Unfortunately, I want to know the truth for some reason.
[02:35:22.339 --> 02:35:23.760]  That holds his mind.
[02:35:23.901 --> 02:35:25.802]  You're right, but I'll tell you what, it's getting easier.
[02:35:25.842 --> 02:35:27.323]  James, thank you very much for the call.
[02:35:27.343 --> 02:35:27.984]  I appreciate that.
[02:35:28.084 --> 02:35:29.005]  That was James from New York.
[02:35:29.665 --> 02:35:30.526]  We've got Trevor.
[02:35:30.586 --> 02:35:31.567]  Trevor from Florida.
[02:35:31.587 --> 02:35:33.528]  You've been holding longer than anybody, Trevor.
[02:35:33.568 --> 02:35:34.309]  Are you still there?
[02:35:35.270 --> 02:35:36.050]  Yes, I'm still here.
[02:35:36.370 --> 02:35:37.311]  I appreciate that.
[02:35:37.671 --> 02:35:42.755]  When Alex called in, I thought, uh-oh, Trevor's going to drop because he's going to have to be a real patient.
[02:35:43.096 --> 02:35:44.837]  I'm glad you held on there, Trevor.
[02:35:44.857 --> 02:35:45.738]  What's on your mind?
[02:35:46.559 --> 02:35:46.999]  Great, thanks.
[02:35:47.997 --> 02:35:52.479]  Well, it's basically an article regarding Bin Laden's newest video.
[02:35:53.419 --> 02:35:57.421]  Anybody could search in Google for new Bin Laden video surfaces.
[02:35:57.641 --> 02:35:59.881]  Yeah, I've seen it.
[02:35:59.901 --> 02:36:00.962]  Go ahead, tell us about it.
[02:36:01.782 --> 02:36:12.006]  So in the fourth paragraph it says, a voice identified as Bin Laden praises 9-11 hijacker Waleed al-Sharif from Saudi Arabia who sat in C2B on American Airlines Flight 11.
[02:36:13.547 --> 02:36:25.872]  Well now, if you go ahead and do another search for hijacked suspects alive and well, go ahead and type that into Google, you're going to get a BBC News report where they identify and show a picture of Waleed Al-Sharif, who is alive.
[02:36:27.673 --> 02:36:31.895]  Saudi Arabian Waleed Al-Sharif was one of the five men the FBI said deliberately crashed the plane.
[02:36:32.315 --> 02:36:34.496]  His photograph was released.
[02:36:34.636 --> 02:36:37.537]  He's appeared in newspapers and televisions around the world.
[02:36:38.007 --> 02:36:45.609]  So, now we have a point where before it used to be where, okay, the FBI messed up, they got the wrong guy, you know, wasn't the right name or something.
[02:36:46.029 --> 02:36:48.010]  Or he stole his wallet or something, yeah.
[02:36:48.810 --> 02:36:53.972]  Right, now we have Osama Bin Laden saying, this guy's a martyr, but he's alive.
[02:36:55.292 --> 02:36:57.953]  So, Osama Bin Laden doesn't know who the hijackers were?
[02:36:57.973 --> 02:36:58.693]  He screwed up!
[02:36:59.463 --> 02:37:00.064]  Oh, come on!
[02:37:00.684 --> 02:37:13.596]  I mean, I guess probably what happened was the fumes from the Grecian formula that they were using to dye his beard with kind of overcame his senses, and then he forgot that one of the martyrs was still alive.
[02:37:14.197 --> 02:37:20.883]  Oh, well, you know, Osama, we all know that Osama is a brilliant genius because he masterminded September 11th.
[02:37:22.051 --> 02:37:31.657]  The brilliant genius that he is, he knew darn well that if you hijack an aircraft in the United States, the fighters are going to be on you in about 15 minutes.
[02:37:32.377 --> 02:37:41.663]  But for some how or other, he was able to luck out into flying the things around forever, one of them for over an hour, before it hit its target.
[02:37:42.569 --> 02:37:48.270]  He was a stupid plan, Osama had, to let those planes fly around that long, but it worked.
[02:37:49.830 --> 02:37:58.932]  But he is an evil genius, a brilliant evil genius, and so the fact that he screwed up about one of his martyrs, I mean, come on, you've got to give the guy a break.
[02:37:58.952 --> 02:37:59.712]  He really did.
[02:38:00.533 --> 02:38:07.914]  He was probably on dialysis there at the hospital in Dubai, and it kind of made him light-headed or something.
[02:38:08.394 --> 02:38:09.055]  That's probably it.
[02:38:09.275 --> 02:38:09.855]  That's probably it.
[02:38:10.235 --> 02:38:23.643]  You do know that he was in a hospital in Dubai in July of 2001, taking up the whole top floor with a big entourage and met with the CIA director, according to Le Figaro, the big French news magazine.
[02:38:23.683 --> 02:38:24.464]  You do know that, right?
[02:38:25.204 --> 02:38:27.045]  Right, yeah, yeah.
[02:38:27.285 --> 02:38:31.828]  He was only on the top of the ten most wanted lists in the whole world at that time.
[02:38:32.506 --> 02:38:35.848]  But they took care of him.
[02:38:35.868 --> 02:38:38.190]  Maybe his beard was the wrong color that day so they let him go.
[02:38:38.210 --> 02:38:38.650]  I don't know.
[02:38:40.151 --> 02:38:44.835]  To see him actually mention the hijacker and have it not be the correct one.
[02:38:44.995 --> 02:38:51.259]  The best hole I could punch in this logic here is maybe there's two Wally's same name.
[02:38:51.539 --> 02:38:53.741]  They have to be under the same terror organization.
[02:38:57.355 --> 02:39:00.536]  Maybe he has an evil twin brother, Waleed II or something like that.
[02:39:20.854 --> 02:39:24.576]  He's like such a smoking gun to me.
[02:39:25.016 --> 02:39:27.398]  Trevor, just add it to the list, okay?
[02:39:27.898 --> 02:39:33.161]  Just add it to the list and call the guys at Fox, and maybe they can debunk your thing in three minutes, too.
[02:39:33.681 --> 02:39:35.802]  Okay, Trevor from Florida, thank you very much for the call.
[02:39:35.862 --> 02:39:38.483]  I certainly do appreciate it, and I appreciate you holding so long, too.
[02:39:39.284 --> 02:39:43.606]  Okay, we got Rob in Wyoming on the line here.
[02:39:43.726 --> 02:39:47.889]  Rob, you're on the Alex Jones Show, and about two million people are listening to you.
[02:39:47.949 --> 02:39:48.509]  Are you nervous?
[02:39:48.902 --> 02:39:49.102]  No.
[02:39:49.562 --> 02:39:50.082]  Good.
[02:39:50.443 --> 02:39:51.163]  I'm not nervous either.
[02:39:51.183 --> 02:39:52.203]  I'm too tired to be nervous.
[02:39:52.483 --> 02:39:52.803]  Right on.
[02:39:53.344 --> 02:39:55.765]  And listen, I got two points if I get to them.
[02:39:56.065 --> 02:39:56.665]  Go right ahead.
[02:39:56.705 --> 02:39:57.485]  Hit them hard.
[02:39:57.745 --> 02:39:58.025]  Okay.
[02:39:58.426 --> 02:40:01.107]  I'm going to give you a couple examples of disinformation.
[02:40:01.747 --> 02:40:05.628]  Just smoking gun, clear cut disinformation on Fox KGB news.
[02:40:06.489 --> 02:40:13.191]  But I also want to talk about the Senate intelligence hearings over September 11th time period and major disinformation there.
[02:40:13.331 --> 02:40:13.551]  Okay.
[02:40:13.591 --> 02:40:14.292]  What about Fox?
[02:40:15.072 --> 02:40:17.453]  Well, we got Sean Insanity.
[02:40:18.892 --> 02:40:24.336]  Telling us that in order to be free, you have to be able to beat back insurgents.
[02:40:25.657 --> 02:40:27.839]  Now, what does that mean?
[02:40:27.859 --> 02:40:35.946]  Insurgents must mean either people that are rising up in your own country or in some country you're militarily occupying, right?
[02:40:36.227 --> 02:40:39.710]  So I looked up the word insurgent in a mid-1980s Webster's
[02:40:47.053 --> 02:40:50.503]  It uses the word rebelling against a lawful government.
[02:40:50.564 --> 02:40:51.005]  Lawful.
[02:40:51.446 --> 02:40:52.169]  Repeats it, right?
[02:40:52.937 --> 02:40:58.982]  Then I go back and look at a 1949 Webster Standard Dictionary, and it's an entry for the word insurgent.
[02:40:59.042 --> 02:41:01.725]  It's got, you know, three or four subtly different definitions.
[02:41:02.185 --> 02:41:05.408]  Not once is the word lawful government in there.
[02:41:05.848 --> 02:41:06.389]  Isn't that odd?
[02:41:06.869 --> 02:41:18.599]  Well, yeah, that's interesting because there's a lot of examples in the dictionary of the meaning of the words being subtly changed to fit the new world order crowds, new definitions of old words.
[02:41:19.376 --> 02:41:21.141]  That's been going on a long time.
[02:41:22.003 --> 02:41:26.295]  If you get a chance, get your old dictionary and look up the word militia.
[02:41:27.538 --> 02:41:36.285]  And then get a new dictionary and look up the word militia because likely the old definition of militia is the one that comports with the Constitution.
[02:41:36.305 --> 02:41:46.333]  You know, it's the people in their capacity, civilians in their capacity to come together to defend the country that are armed and they will come together to defend the country, which is the... Right.
[02:41:46.353 --> 02:41:49.195]  Well, that's what the Militia Act of 1792 very clearly states.
[02:41:49.575 --> 02:42:02.904]  Yeah, but if you look at some of these new dictionaries, the definition of militia, you will find out that it basically says a bunch of right-wing, crazy, extremist, wacko, kooks running around in the woods with guns.
[02:42:03.284 --> 02:42:05.086]  I'm not kidding!
[02:42:05.106 --> 02:42:06.106]  Not standard dictionaries.
[02:42:06.586 --> 02:42:07.467]  Legal dictionaries.
[02:42:07.487 --> 02:42:08.628]  You've really got to watch those.
[02:42:09.758 --> 02:42:23.827]  But the definition of militia in the Militia Act of 1792, the purpose of it, tells you expressly to suppress combinations that would otherwise be too powerful for the ordinary course of judicial proceedings.
[02:42:24.727 --> 02:42:28.630]  So in other words, the judiciary has been co-opted or hijacked in this scenario.
[02:42:29.010 --> 02:42:31.231]  This combination is too powerful.
[02:42:31.411 --> 02:42:32.412]  It's an emergency, right?
[02:42:32.692 --> 02:42:33.933]  It's a national emergency.
[02:42:34.936 --> 02:42:37.718]  Anyway, there's another example of disinformation.
[02:42:37.758 --> 02:42:41.800]  Glenn Beck, he talks about the BTK killer.
[02:42:41.980 --> 02:42:45.102]  He describes himself as a conservative, which is a huge mystery to me.
[02:42:45.122 --> 02:42:48.304]  He's just like a total communist, big government worshipper.
[02:42:49.985 --> 02:42:56.649]  But he wants to give lip service to different conservative values, like mass murderers being executed.
[02:42:56.669 --> 02:43:01.152]  Never says he should be executed, but he refers to the BTK killer and how he's getting
[02:43:03.234 --> 02:43:04.015]  I don't think so.
[02:43:24.108 --> 02:43:26.991]  Wouldn't that make his case even stronger as to how ridiculous it is?
[02:43:27.011 --> 02:43:32.417]  Yeah, but the neocon types think that torturing people is fine, so maybe that's why he left it out.
[02:43:32.938 --> 02:43:39.525]  So he left it out, that's an admission that the people at Abu Ghraib are BTK killers.
[02:43:39.946 --> 02:43:41.828]  The same people he claims he hates, right?
[02:43:42.210 --> 02:43:45.131]  Yeah, well, you know, what can I say?
[02:43:45.191 --> 02:43:46.091]  I'm not going to defend him.
[02:43:46.911 --> 02:43:54.492]  I know Glenn Beck has done a couple of good, slipped into a couple of good things here and there, but I don't care for the guy.
[02:43:54.552 --> 02:43:59.673]  He says we need to invade Iran right now, the Muslims are all, you know.
[02:43:59.733 --> 02:44:01.694]  He's crazy if he thinks we need to invade Iran.
[02:44:03.154 --> 02:44:07.495]  Look, the same people that are feeding us this bull about we need to invade Iran, the same ones that got us in this mess in Iraq.
[02:44:08.467 --> 02:44:11.869]  You know, what did they used to say on Gomer Powell?
[02:44:11.949 --> 02:44:14.131]  Fool me once, shame on you.
[02:44:14.731 --> 02:44:16.012]  Fool me twice, shame on me.
[02:44:16.092 --> 02:44:17.012]  Hey, I got that right.
[02:44:17.052 --> 02:44:18.814]  President Bush couldn't get it right, but I got it right.
[02:44:18.874 --> 02:44:19.314]  How about that?
[02:44:19.934 --> 02:44:20.955]  They fooled him more than once.
[02:44:21.015 --> 02:44:21.815]  Oh boy, oh boy.
[02:44:21.896 --> 02:44:23.056]  He's fooled us more than once.
[02:44:23.096 --> 02:44:24.017]  Yeah, unfortunately.
[02:44:24.357 --> 02:44:26.879]  Okay, just let me get to this point and I'll get off real quick.
[02:44:27.739 --> 02:44:31.442]  The C-SPAN coverage of these intelligence hearings.
[02:44:32.463 --> 02:44:34.184]  Which I can hardly watch them very long.
[02:44:34.204 --> 02:44:35.164]  I mean, they're so upsetting.
[02:44:35.925 --> 02:44:46.269]  Anyway, we've got Chertoff and his con, or the head of the National SS, or whatever it's called, National Secret Service, or Security Service, or something like that.
[02:44:46.930 --> 02:44:51.171]  It's another new agency because Fatherland Security's not getting the job done enough, or something.
[02:44:51.472 --> 02:44:52.152]  Ach, du lieber.
[02:44:53.064 --> 02:44:59.888]  Yeah, and one of the things he says is, right off the bat, Connor, is, we can't reveal our methods to the enemy, right?
[02:44:59.908 --> 02:45:08.493]  In other words, even to tell you what it's about would tip off a shrewd master genius, evil genius like Bin Laden, right?
[02:45:08.913 --> 02:45:11.495]  And I can kind of see the logic in that in some situations.
[02:45:12.155 --> 02:45:14.158]  But it's totally contradicted by what they do.
[02:45:14.538 --> 02:45:23.227]  To say that what big royal cronies Cheney met with in 2000, just to reveal that to our enemies, is ridiculous.
[02:45:23.247 --> 02:45:30.574]  Especially when you consider he's sitting there, not batting an eyelash, nodding in sympathy with Chertoff, as Chertoff tells the world.
[02:45:31.235 --> 02:45:36.899]  The Department of Homeland Security hopes someday to get devices that can detect explosives.
[02:45:37.699 --> 02:45:41.922]  Now, A, you mean you don't already, after six years, have that?
[02:45:41.962 --> 02:45:43.282]  Where's all this money been going?
[02:45:43.523 --> 02:45:51.167]  But more importantly, B, you're revealing the highly sensitive fact to our enemies that you don't, you still don't already have that?
[02:45:51.428 --> 02:45:52.468]  Even now you don't have that?
[02:45:53.069 --> 02:45:54.449]  Yeah, well I think he's probably lying.
[02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:55.210]  I bet they do have it.
[02:45:55.230 --> 02:45:57.191]  They got stuff that you wouldn't believe, you know.
[02:45:57.251 --> 02:46:00.213]  He's probably just telling them that they don't have it, even though we do have it.
[02:46:00.834 --> 02:46:07.417]  But by the official story, if anything would be highly sensitive information, certainly that kind of thing would be, and they do it all the time.
[02:46:07.437 --> 02:46:08.877]  I mean, this is just one of many examples.
[02:46:09.057 --> 02:46:09.917]  Yeah.
[02:46:09.997 --> 02:46:14.559]  Connors, the national security guy, he has no problem with divulging misinformation.
[02:46:14.579 --> 02:46:15.420]  None of them do.
[02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:16.300]  Yeah.
[02:46:16.840 --> 02:46:18.801]  Well, that's because they're all a bunch of crooks and liars.
[02:46:19.461 --> 02:46:27.084]  I mean, bottom line, I mean, you know, the United States government at the top levels is run by crooks and liars, and as a result of that, people die.
[02:46:27.714 --> 02:46:36.577]  The people die in mass and that's why 9-1-1 is so important and to me is because it's like, okay, wake up.
[02:46:36.937 --> 02:46:38.057]  We need to arrest these people.
[02:46:38.077 --> 02:46:39.598]  They need to be in jail, you know.
[02:46:39.898 --> 02:46:42.018]  And Rob, I thank you for the call.
[02:46:42.038 --> 02:46:42.579]  I appreciate it.
[02:46:43.479 --> 02:46:47.040]  We've got Alex in California holding on the line.
[02:46:47.140 --> 02:46:47.720]  Alex, are you there?
[02:46:48.540 --> 02:46:48.961]  Yes, I am.
[02:46:48.981 --> 02:46:49.421]  How are you doing?
[02:46:50.101 --> 02:46:52.682]  I am just about doing good.
[02:46:52.722 --> 02:46:55.403]  We got about another minute until, two minutes.
[02:46:55.543 --> 02:46:56.003]  All right.
[02:46:57.458 --> 02:47:02.685]  I was just wondering if you guys had talked about the September 14th Air Force complete stand down at all?
[02:47:02.845 --> 02:47:04.287]  Yeah, I talked about that in the first hour.
[02:47:04.307 --> 02:47:04.767]  I sure did.
[02:47:04.927 --> 02:47:06.750]  Okay, I'm so sorry.
[02:47:06.770 --> 02:47:08.572]  I wanted to bring that up but I wasn't sure because...
[02:47:09.198 --> 02:47:15.980]  There's also the put options I wanted to bring up that are coming at you on the 21st that are betting on a 30-50% market crash.
[02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:18.120]  Yeah, I haven't talked about that.
[02:47:18.700 --> 02:47:20.541]  It's been in the news, I think.
[02:47:21.261 --> 02:47:24.562]  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff speculatively that's out there.
[02:47:24.582 --> 02:47:27.943]  You've got to watch out for drills and you've got to watch out for put options.
[02:47:27.983 --> 02:47:35.885]  We know that for a fact, but hopefully enough people are aware of that little shenanigan that nothing's going to happen.
[02:47:38.402 --> 02:47:38.502]  It's
[02:47:52.242 --> 02:48:01.911]  Yeah, well that was the nuclear, did you talk about the, um, what was it, the warheads that were accidentally... Yeah, flying six nuclear warheads accidentally across the country.
[02:48:01.931 --> 02:48:08.477]  Hey, get up there and get over to that shed and get them six cruise missiles there and slap them on that old B-52, yeah!
[02:48:10.225 --> 02:48:13.226]  Yeah, just all those three things together is kind of what I wanted to talk about.
[02:48:13.246 --> 02:48:21.570]  I mean, it's pretty shady here about 14th and all that and the nuclear missiles and all the planes attacks and feelings and all that kind of stuff.
[02:48:21.750 --> 02:48:25.131]  Cross your fingers and hope nothing like that happens.
[02:48:25.211 --> 02:48:26.532]  Alex, thank you for pointing that out.
[02:48:27.072 --> 02:48:34.936]  Okay, we're coming up on another break and then we're going to go into the last segment of today's September 12th edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:48:35.096 --> 02:48:36.516]  Bob Dacey sitting in for Alex.
[02:48:37.437 --> 02:48:37.977]  Be back in a bit.
[02:48:43.577 --> 02:48:48.482]  It's here!
[02:48:48.682 --> 02:48:53.467]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:53.828 --> 02:49:01.456]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.153 --> 02:49:09.197]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.597 --> 02:49:21.023]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.343 --> 02:49:24.845]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.306 --> 02:49:27.247]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.567 --> 02:49:31.409]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:26.121 --> 02:51:26.581]  We're good to go.
[02:51:53.364 --> 02:51:59.028]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:51:59.068 --> 02:52:01.129]  We're sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[02:52:01.169 --> 02:52:06.032]  This is the Alex Jones Show, worldwide, nationwide, on DCN Radio Network.
[02:52:06.432 --> 02:52:09.474]  This is Bob Dacey, substituting for Alex Jones.
[02:52:09.554 --> 02:52:12.076]  Alex will be back again tomorrow.
[02:52:12.196 --> 02:52:16.158]  Hopefully he'll be somewhat rested from his travels to New York.
[02:52:16.438 --> 02:52:18.840]  I've got time for probably two more callers.
[02:52:19.500 --> 02:52:20.941]  I've got Mike from Texas on the line.
[02:52:24.389 --> 02:52:25.029]  Mike, are you there?
[02:52:26.690 --> 02:52:27.031]  Hello?
[02:52:28.011 --> 02:52:28.772]  Yeah, now I'm on.
[02:52:28.992 --> 02:52:29.752]  Okay, there you go.
[02:52:29.792 --> 02:52:30.332]  There's Mike.
[02:52:30.413 --> 02:52:30.713]  All right.
[02:52:30.733 --> 02:52:31.413]  What's going on, Mike?
[02:52:31.913 --> 02:52:32.654]  You know, I like your show.
[02:52:32.674 --> 02:52:33.474]  You're an awesome Ted.
[02:52:33.574 --> 02:52:35.816]  I tape it and I put it on the DVD all the time.
[02:52:35.836 --> 02:52:36.276]  Well, thank you.
[02:52:36.296 --> 02:52:37.797]  It'll be in an archive somewhere.
[02:52:37.977 --> 02:52:38.797]  Well, I appreciate that.
[02:52:39.318 --> 02:52:41.819]  I've got three real quick things I want to say that are just real quick.
[02:52:41.999 --> 02:52:42.940]  Make them quick.
[02:52:43.480 --> 02:52:43.660]  Yeah.
[02:52:44.180 --> 02:52:46.802]  When you say, when somebody says, I don't believe you, three things.
[02:52:46.822 --> 02:52:47.742]  You mentioned the borders.
[02:52:47.923 --> 02:52:48.523]  Why are the borders
[02:52:48.962 --> 02:52:50.002]  Always been open, they say.
[02:52:50.362 --> 02:52:52.143]  Our government wouldn't lie to us, and they're trying to protect us.
[02:52:52.163 --> 02:52:53.363]  That's why the border's always been open.
[02:52:53.383 --> 02:52:55.604]  Anybody could sneak across there with a backpack of explosives.
[02:52:55.784 --> 02:52:58.384]  Number two, Pentagon cameras.
[02:52:58.964 --> 02:53:01.205]  That's the most heavily surveilled building in the world.
[02:53:01.445 --> 02:53:06.306]  Why they don't have any cameras, if they did show anything, would show what a lie they're telling.
[02:53:06.486 --> 02:53:08.847]  And the third thing is, used car salesmen.
[02:53:09.527 --> 02:53:13.148]  When I say, oh, they wouldn't lie to us, look how well dressed they are, look how they smile.
[02:53:13.584 --> 02:53:16.426]  These people have never been on a used car lot with a used car salesman.
[02:53:16.566 --> 02:53:17.026]  I mean come on.
[02:53:17.046 --> 02:53:18.487]  That's what I wanted to say.
[02:53:31.465 --> 02:53:33.106]  Hey Bob, you mentioned that you write for the New American.
[02:53:58.157 --> 02:53:59.618]  I mean, I saw your article a while back.
[02:54:00.339 --> 02:54:04.762]  I wonder what their position is on 9-11 because I haven't seen any articles about it being an inside job yet.
[02:54:05.242 --> 02:54:06.183]  Are you in the New American?
[02:54:06.897 --> 02:54:08.978]  Yeah, they've beat around the bush about it.
[02:54:08.998 --> 02:54:10.218]  They've put a few things on there.
[02:54:10.238 --> 02:54:16.739]  I know that they wrote an article a while back about the Northwoods document and how that stinks to everything.
[02:54:17.179 --> 02:54:21.360]  I think the New American has said, look, there's so many people doing 9-1-1 and the Merch Society is more
[02:54:29.460 --> 02:54:35.123]  Long term oriented and they're concentrating on the big train wreck that is the North American Union right now.
[02:54:35.523 --> 02:54:37.304]  They have limited resources like everybody else.
[02:54:37.685 --> 02:54:43.828]  People pick and choose what they do in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:54:44.628 --> 02:54:45.889]  I'm in both camps.
[02:54:46.049 --> 02:54:49.311]  I'm a bircher and I'm fighting the North American Union like nobody's business.
[02:54:49.751 --> 02:54:52.112]  Fighting the Trans-Texas Corridor like nobody's business.
[02:54:52.172 --> 02:54:53.712]  Fighting the NAFTA Superhighway.
[02:54:54.072 --> 02:54:55.713]  We've done tremendous work.
[02:54:56.333 --> 02:54:59.974]  Kelly Taylor, of course, you know, she's one of my producers on my TV show.
[02:55:00.474 --> 02:55:05.356]  She's the writer for the New American on the topic of the NAFTA Superhighway.
[02:55:05.956 --> 02:55:15.139]  And we're concentrating on that because if they succeed in linking Canada, the United States, and Mexico into one country, the Constitution's over.
[02:55:15.726 --> 02:55:18.907]  And then you can have academic discussions about 9-11 all you want.
[02:55:19.247 --> 02:55:23.128]  The country has to be preserved as an independent, sovereign nation.
[02:55:23.808 --> 02:55:27.669]  And that is what the John Birch Society is focusing on right now.
[02:55:28.029 --> 02:55:33.990]  And I think, due to the fact that there are so many other people focusing on 9-11, they don't really have to.
[02:55:34.010 --> 02:55:35.011]  They really don't.
[02:55:36.391 --> 02:55:37.851]  But I do appreciate the call, Wes.
[02:55:37.971 --> 02:55:39.352]  We're just about out of time.
[02:55:39.912 --> 02:55:44.893]  And I want to thank Alex again for letting me come on this show.
[02:55:46.181 --> 02:55:52.805]  Sit in the command chair in the Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines for the last three days.
[02:55:53.425 --> 02:55:54.086]  I enjoy it.
[02:55:54.206 --> 02:55:55.026]  I love doing it.
[02:55:55.467 --> 02:55:56.567]  And it's an honor.
[02:55:56.727 --> 02:55:59.929]  It's an absolute honor that Alex lets me do this.
[02:56:00.389 --> 02:56:02.731]  And I guess I'll have to go back to my local TV show now.
[02:56:03.611 --> 02:56:10.835]  And, once again, for Alex and everybody here at this command center, I want to thank everybody.
[02:56:11.455 --> 02:56:15.597]  Y'all get after the New World Order, and I'll probably see you sometime in this show later on.
[02:56:15.637 --> 02:56:17.118]  This is Bob Dacey, signing off.
[02:56:17.178 --> 02:56:17.558]  Take care.
[02:56:18.118 --> 02:56:22.140]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7000.
