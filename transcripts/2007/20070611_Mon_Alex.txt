[00:00:05.753 --> 00:00:06.393]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:08.133]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:09.934]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:11.394]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.155 --> 00:00:13.075]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:17.357]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:22.018]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:26.100]  We live in a nation run by lawless criminals.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.221]  Their criminality is becoming more and more obvious to the general public.
[00:00:30.902 --> 00:00:38.248]  Will he be able to avert a complete collapse of our society that makes the collapse of the Soviet Union look tame in comparison?
[00:00:39.028 --> 00:00:49.496]  The Ed Delane Brown standoff was averted last week, but will the Feds, with the locals, come back in on them at any moment, at any time?
[00:00:49.517 --> 00:00:52.459]  It boils down to this.
[00:00:53.388 --> 00:01:05.698]  The illegal aliens are being given five years of total, complete tax amnesty, something no one else will be given by the private tax of the private banks via the 16th Amendment that was never ratified.
[00:01:05.718 --> 00:01:14.766]  Illegal aliens don't have to pay taxes, but if old people don't, then they're going to send snipers in to take them out.
[00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:22.469]  Well, we don't want the Browns to die, and we don't want any of the police to be killed, any of the feds to be killed.
[00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.713]  Going in to do it, and we hope that cooler minds will prevail.
[00:01:27.994 --> 00:01:38.926]  I did see POTOC of the Southern Poverty Law Center in the AP over the weekend, with the ongoing standoff in New Hampshire, saying that, well, if they get killed, it is going to radically expand
[00:01:39.753 --> 00:02:01.225]  These radical movements, you know, the people that know the Bilderberg Group existed before it was ever in the news, and the folks that got the SPP.gov documents about the North American Union, and the folks that don't want all our roads being turned over to foreign companies, or the folks that don't want to lose our Second Amendment or our property rights, those that you list, Mr. Potok, as terrorists?
[00:02:02.865 --> 00:02:07.368]  The people you list, Mr. Potok, as terrorists?
[00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:12.649]  As terrorists.
[00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:20.872]  But they admit, and they say, yes, we don't want the feds to go in and kill them because this could cause a revolution.
[00:02:21.972 --> 00:02:23.753]  And that's absolutely correct.
[00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:27.135]  So finally, on one issue, I agree with Mr. Potok.
[00:02:28.435 --> 00:02:38.219]  It is not going to help the movement for liberty and freedom if some type of armored SWAT team goes in there and one or two officers get killed.
[00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:41.172]  I mean, I really don't want you to die.
[00:02:41.192 --> 00:02:41.733]  Do you understand?
[00:02:41.793 --> 00:02:43.054]  I want you to have a good life.
[00:02:43.154 --> 00:02:45.816]  I want you to have healthy, happy children.
[00:02:45.876 --> 00:02:47.197]  I want you to live in a nice house.
[00:02:47.617 --> 00:02:48.638]  I want you to go fishing.
[00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:55.063]  I wish to God you'd realize we're the good guys and we've done our studying and what we're saying is true.
[00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:57.425]  There really is a new world order.
[00:02:58.826 --> 00:03:00.488]  I was thinking about it this weekend, you know.
[00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:09.900]  I know FBI and I know other government agents listen to this show, and I get up here and I say Halliburton and DynCorp run giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:21.589]  Now we reported that five, six, seven years ago when it was in the BBC and Der Spiegel, but I mean now it's in the Chicago Tribune, no ifs, ands, or buts, it's admitted.
[00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:25.967]  And those are the type of corporations that lobby and really control our government.
[00:03:25.987 --> 00:03:31.551]  And I'm asking you, do you like being part of a system that does things like that?
[00:03:32.372 --> 00:03:38.396]  Or do you just sit there in your office listening right now, or in your squad car, and just go, oh, that guy makes that up.
[00:03:39.376 --> 00:03:41.578]  You better hope I'm making this stuff up.
[00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:42.879]  And let me give you a newsflash.
[00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.001]  You already know in your gut I'm not making this up.
[00:03:47.578 --> 00:03:54.500]  And you're afraid, when you get home tonight, to type it into Google and pull up the Chicago Tribune and the Associated Press.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.621]  Because then you might have to join us, and you might have to do something about this.
[00:04:00.961 --> 00:04:02.182]  I mean, yeah, this stuff's scary.
[00:04:03.882 --> 00:04:06.763]  It is scary every day to do what I do, to do what I have to do.
[00:04:07.383 --> 00:04:10.904]  I was up here Saturday night, and some of my employees came in who'd been bowling.
[00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:19.931]  They came in about midnight and they saw us in here working, Rob and Aaron and myself, and they're like, wow, you guys really do work in the middle of the night.
[00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:21.653]  And we're like, yeah, we do.
[00:04:23.114 --> 00:04:30.460]  And because I had pulled up on the screen, admitted federal documents, actually the purchase orders funding the construction of FEMA camps in 1984, 86, 87, 90, 92, 95, 97, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005.
[00:04:42.003 --> 00:04:43.044]  And I said, you see these?
[00:04:43.965 --> 00:04:46.987]  These are the purchase orders for the camps.
[00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:52.391]  And I said, you're damn right I'm up here working in the middle of the night.
[00:04:53.472 --> 00:04:55.714]  Because we know what's going on and we're trying to stop it.
[00:04:56.234 --> 00:04:56.875]  Desperately.
[00:04:57.575 --> 00:04:58.176]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:10.041]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.402 --> 00:05:18.012]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.723 --> 00:05:25.788]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.188 --> 00:05:37.615]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.915 --> 00:05:41.838]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.858 --> 00:05:43.799]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.982]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:03.203 --> 00:06:07.706]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:08.046 --> 00:06:12.128]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:12.428 --> 00:06:12.969]  We listened.
[00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:18.252]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:18.532 --> 00:06:19.032]  We listened.
[00:06:19.413 --> 00:06:22.454]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:23.395]  We listened.
[00:06:23.855 --> 00:06:27.920]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.801]  We listened.
[00:06:29.141 --> 00:06:34.387]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:06:34.788 --> 00:06:36.149]  Again, we listened.
[00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.051]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:06:38.632 --> 00:06:39.312]  We're good to go.
[00:07:00.908 --> 00:07:03.389]  Do you know that you can go solar for under 1200 bucks now?
[00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:05.049]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:09.410]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.891]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[00:07:15.391 --> 00:07:21.813]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[00:07:22.561 --> 00:07:25.263]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[00:07:25.423 --> 00:07:35.388]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[00:07:35.668 --> 00:07:39.370]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:45.914]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[00:07:46.094 --> 00:07:47.134]  Are you ready to go solar?
[00:07:47.335 --> 00:07:48.295]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.
[00:07:52.198 --> 00:07:56.244]  Or order them on the website at a 10% discount on KenSolar.com.
[00:07:56.505 --> 00:07:57.967]  That's KenSolar.com.
[00:08:06.002 --> 00:08:06.643]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.323 --> 00:08:08.364]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.085 --> 00:08:10.266]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.846 --> 00:08:11.667]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.428 --> 00:08:13.428]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.989 --> 00:08:17.932]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.172 --> 00:08:22.956]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.597 --> 00:08:30.122]  Matt Khaji lives on the Virginia Tech and Blacksburg, Virginia campus.
[00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:34.066]  He reported live for us during the shooting a few months ago.
[00:08:34.987 --> 00:08:39.048]  He heard the radio broadcast Thursday and made the decision to drive up there on Friday.
[00:08:39.068 --> 00:08:40.989]  He got there yesterday.
[00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:47.431]  He's trying to set up wireless internet so that the independent media can see what's really happening there.
[00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:48.411]  He has a lot of courage.
[00:08:49.152 --> 00:08:56.554]  Also, we saw that the folks from WeAreChange.org, ReportingForInfoWars.com, Luke and Matt,
[00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.913]  Uh, LePacek and others were there until Saturday.
[00:09:00.953 --> 00:09:02.393]  We're going to get them to pop in and report.
[00:09:02.654 --> 00:09:03.854]  There's been a new development.
[00:09:03.874 --> 00:09:06.416]  The power got turned off again.
[00:09:06.436 --> 00:09:10.539]  Now their phones and power got turned off last Thursday evening.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.782]  They're in New Hampshire, as many of you already know, but let me just briefly recap.
[00:09:15.802 --> 00:09:16.683]  This is a family
[00:09:17.672 --> 00:09:19.753]  A husband and wife with no criminal records.
[00:09:19.813 --> 00:09:21.554]  He's a successful businessman.
[00:09:21.974 --> 00:09:26.095]  She was a successful dentist with a very large practice.
[00:09:26.555 --> 00:09:30.557]  They live in a more than two million dollar home on their own property.
[00:09:31.417 --> 00:09:34.658]  She also had a very large dental office with other dentists working for her.
[00:09:35.979 --> 00:09:44.302]  Very large successful practice and they started asking the government to show them the law to pay the income tax.
[00:09:45.954 --> 00:09:52.856]  And they responded by raiding their home with a bunch of tax agents years ago, and then kangaroo trials, you name it.
[00:09:53.596 --> 00:09:57.857]  And so they just said, that's it, we're going to go to our property, we're going to wait for you to come, we're going to defend ourselves.
[00:09:59.838 --> 00:10:08.920]  And then, of course, the lying local head of the federal marshals said, we have no plan to ever raid you, no plan to ever go on the property, that means you can bet it will be the opposite.
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.800]  They've just learned this is their MO.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.321]  They speak of a fork of tongue, as they say.
[00:10:14.579 --> 00:10:26.239]  And sure enough, Thursday, a gentleman was walking the dog on the property at about 7.30 in the morning and he walked to the end of the property out by the road.
[00:10:27.023 --> 00:10:48.192]  And he saw some guys with guns across the street and he said what are you doing turkey hunting and they said freeze and he turned and ran and they fired two shots at him then men popped up in front of him and he put up his hands and said I give up I don't have any weapons somebody said tasering they tasered him and they told him you're going to go to the media and say we didn't shoot at you that you walked to the front
[00:10:52.108 --> 00:11:04.077]  That you walked to the front gate, and that plainclothes officers were serving a seizure warrant for the dental property 10 miles away, and that we said freeze and you ran, and that we tackled you.
[00:11:04.598 --> 00:11:06.559]  Why would process servers tackle him?
[00:11:06.719 --> 00:11:07.980]  I mean, that's a lie on its face.
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.361]  They've now admitted they were lying.
[00:11:10.782 --> 00:11:15.806]  They've admitted kind of in a sideways way to the AP and the local newspapers and TV, but not completely.
[00:11:16.086 --> 00:11:19.249]  And then they took him and said, you're going to get 15 years in prison.
[00:11:19.549 --> 00:11:20.730]  Two FBI agents did.
[00:11:21.893 --> 00:11:23.755]  There at the local Lebanon Police Department.
[00:11:23.795 --> 00:11:29.001]  If you don't go back and tell the media that you just got tackled, that FBI isn't involved.
[00:11:29.261 --> 00:11:31.183]  Then they told him how he was under surveillance.
[00:11:31.563 --> 00:11:34.987]  They described things he'd been doing the day before on the Brown property.
[00:11:36.408 --> 00:11:37.529]  Namely with a .50 Cal.
[00:11:37.549 --> 00:11:39.091]  They were out shooting at the shooting range.
[00:11:40.593 --> 00:11:42.615]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:44.757]  It goes on from there.
[00:11:46.793 --> 00:11:50.495]  And it's just really, really sad to see all of this unfolding.
[00:11:50.535 --> 00:11:53.917]  Now they've turned the power and the phones off again.
[00:11:54.477 --> 00:12:00.540]  They do have cell phones out of the facility, out of the home, which has been called a compound.
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.961]  Again, this is how they semantically dehumanize everything.
[00:12:03.982 --> 00:12:08.544]  And we now go to Ed Brown, and also we got Matt Kazee there waiting in the wings.
[00:12:09.244 --> 00:12:10.605]  Mr. Brown, New Developments.
[00:12:11.886 --> 00:12:12.246]  Yes, sir.
[00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:16.188]  We had a gentleman come in yesterday, wanted to come in.
[00:12:17.129 --> 00:12:18.050]  We allowed him to come in.
[00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.731]  He used the name of Rip.
[00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:23.632]  He said he was coming in from South Carolina and wanted to visit.
[00:12:23.652 --> 00:12:26.313]  He supported what we were doing and all that good stuff.
[00:12:26.353 --> 00:12:29.895]  Well, he came in yesterday around noontime, sometime.
[00:12:31.095 --> 00:12:35.577]  And as soon as he came in, we talked for about a few minutes, I realized that he was not one of us.
[00:12:35.998 --> 00:12:41.240]  He was most surely working for the other side, so I couldn't take the conversation anymore, so I left.
[00:12:41.826 --> 00:12:43.887]  Let some of the other guys talk with him.
[00:12:44.067 --> 00:12:46.767]  Let me guess, he started telling you to come out and things like that?
[00:12:47.388 --> 00:12:47.808]  No, no, no.
[00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:49.628]  Just pretending he's a patriot.
[00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:54.569]  You know, talking about how he agrees with us and this sort of thing and that.
[00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.610]  That he's a good Christian.
[00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:02.372]  But then we realized after a few minutes of talking that he's not a good Christian.
[00:13:02.392 --> 00:13:03.132]  He's not even a Christian.
[00:13:03.832 --> 00:13:07.633]  The fact is that he's trying to say he's a white supremacist next, that he's a hillbilly.
[00:13:08.403 --> 00:13:15.686]  Uh, from South Carolina, but he's from Ohio, or he's from Virginia, but we couldn't figure out what he's trying to tell us, or what he's trying to say.
[00:13:15.706 --> 00:13:17.427]  He was talking in riddles, almost.
[00:13:18.087 --> 00:13:21.468]  He's just throwing out anything to get you to trust him.
[00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:26.190]  Exactly, but nothing worked, because as soon as they start that, we know he's not normal.
[00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:29.231]  If he's not normal, he more than likely works at the federal agencies.
[00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:31.252]  Yeah, let's just give the feds a little...
[00:13:32.358 --> 00:13:35.200]  For the federal minions, don't believe your own propaganda.
[00:13:36.061 --> 00:13:38.944]  99% of us are not white supremacists like you tell everybody we are.
[00:13:39.604 --> 00:13:40.185]  Yeah, right.
[00:13:41.065 --> 00:13:42.086]  I don't even know what that means.
[00:13:43.327 --> 00:13:43.988]  But good lord.
[00:13:44.008 --> 00:13:47.651]  So anyway, he after four hours, he finally left.
[00:13:47.691 --> 00:13:48.371]  Thank God for that.
[00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:51.114]  He's a pretty boy with a thick beard and stuff.
[00:13:52.175 --> 00:13:52.775]  Then he left.
[00:13:53.035 --> 00:13:59.681]  And then following this morning, all of a sudden, early this morning, around 730 or so, I forgot now, 8 o'clock,
[00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.250]  He calls back.
[00:14:03.271 --> 00:14:10.736]  And he says, alright, this is Rip, I'm down here in my jacuzzi, just relaxing, like, who cares, I just got out of my jacuzzi too.
[00:14:11.657 --> 00:14:15.559]  And the Rangers, by the way, the Rangers are no good.
[00:14:15.579 --> 00:14:17.481]  I said, what are you talking about?
[00:14:17.541 --> 00:14:23.865]  I said, look, we know you're a fed, wherever you're from, you're probably one of those guys in the ghillie suits up here at the end of the driveway last Thursday.
[00:14:24.677 --> 00:14:28.220]  Well, he immediately changes his attitude and complexion at that point there.
[00:14:28.621 --> 00:14:34.446]  He goes, those Rangers, he says, they're all a bunch of blah, blah, blah, toilet paper, he says, whatever that means.
[00:14:34.926 --> 00:14:37.368]  I said, well, at least there's a lot of them, but they're soft.
[00:14:38.009 --> 00:14:39.970]  I said, but those aren't the ones you have to worry about.
[00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:42.493]  And he hung up.
[00:14:42.873 --> 00:14:44.975]  And by Rangers, who is he talking about?
[00:14:44.995 --> 00:14:47.477]  The United States Constitution Ranger.
[00:14:48.194 --> 00:14:51.137]  Oh, okay, so he was like saying you guys are wimps, I understand.
[00:14:51.157 --> 00:14:54.120]  You're not trying to be a tough guy here, you're saying go ahead and kill me.
[00:15:11.792 --> 00:15:12.452]  I mean, I'll fight.
[00:15:12.493 --> 00:15:13.233]  Of course I'll fight.
[00:15:13.273 --> 00:15:17.696]  I don't believe I could beat him or win, but I'm not going to let him intimidate me or stop me.
[00:15:18.136 --> 00:15:21.579]  I'm sworn oath to protect and defend a form of government here.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.782]  So anyway, he hung up on me and he didn't want to talk anymore.
[00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:29.284]  Then about a minute later, they killed the power.
[00:15:29.564 --> 00:15:32.927]  Oh yeah, no doubt that guy was one of their best negotiators they sent in.
[00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:34.808]  Oh, good lord.
[00:15:35.328 --> 00:15:35.929]  That's the best.
[00:15:36.009 --> 00:15:37.210]  You're being facetious again.
[00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.932]  Well, let me propose something here, okay?
[00:15:40.972 --> 00:15:52.379]  Because I'm not sitting here like a spectator, like a lot of people are, wanting to hear about you guys being killed and to get some war on with the corporate government we have.
[00:15:52.839 --> 00:16:01.745]  What I really want to do here is to get you guys to where you're not dead in a pool of blood and a couple federal marshals or FBI hostage rescue team guys or Delta Force
[00:16:02.205 --> 00:16:03.226]  Well, I like all that stuff.
[00:16:03.246 --> 00:16:04.166]  Why would they use that against us?
[00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:28.630]  Yes.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.363]  Up in New Hampshire, I mean, let's just say their tax is legitimate, which obviously it isn't.
[00:16:50.244 --> 00:16:57.730]  Why can't they give you a pardon, just to end all this, just to have it all go away?
[00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:03.174]  I guess they're afraid that others will hear that you can just hold up then and get out of paying the income tax.
[00:17:03.755 --> 00:17:09.499]  I mean, that's their perspective, but if they can give illegal aliens, I think that should be our battle cry here, to try to end this.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.183]  If they can give illegal aliens amnesty and a pardon, why can't they give everyone a round?
[00:17:16.573 --> 00:17:17.334]  Dead, Elaine?
[00:17:17.814 --> 00:17:18.094]  Yes.
[00:17:18.995 --> 00:17:21.217]  Why can't they give you amnesty if they can give you legal amnesty?
[00:17:21.237 --> 00:17:22.338]  No, I don't want amnesty.
[00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:26.481]  I don't accept anything they have to say at any point.
[00:17:26.841 --> 00:17:27.482]  They're a fiction.
[00:17:28.022 --> 00:17:29.443]  But I understand where you're coming from.
[00:17:29.683 --> 00:17:31.745]  Yeah, why couldn't they if they could give it for somebody else?
[00:17:32.666 --> 00:17:34.587]  But I don't want anything from them.
[00:17:34.627 --> 00:17:35.208]  We never did.
[00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:40.312]  We've paid enough into these criminals so they can conduct their war around the world.
[00:17:42.213 --> 00:17:42.994]  We don't care, Alex.
[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:58.226]  Yes, I'm just speechless because I really like you and Elaine, and at the same time I know it's not going to hurt the New World Order for bad things that happen to these people if they try to run in there trying to kill you.
[00:17:58.426 --> 00:18:01.147]  I just, my God, where do you see all this ending then, Ed?
[00:18:01.167 --> 00:18:07.031]  I mean, if you have to like go deep into your, you know, your brain and your soul, and I mean really when, you know, you're sitting there at 2 a.m.
[00:18:07.091 --> 00:18:09.452]  at night, sitting there in the easy chair, maybe 5 a.m.
[00:18:09.472 --> 00:18:12.694]  in the morning, whenever you're, you know, quiet time, what do you think is going to happen?
[00:18:13.094 --> 00:18:13.814]  Well, I've got nothing.
[00:18:13.894 --> 00:18:14.255]  I don't know.
[00:18:15.697 --> 00:18:21.440]  Listen, something, as I said before Alex, something wonderful is coming, and fearsome.
[00:18:22.741 --> 00:18:25.182]  And it's not fearsome against us.
[00:18:26.723 --> 00:18:32.686]  Something that they had not counted on is happening right now, by the hour, in this country and world.
[00:18:33.527 --> 00:18:37.589]  And we're getting reports about it from all over the place, from people, and I mean all over the world.
[00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.692]  The Freemasons are being identified, right now as we speak.
[00:18:43.012 --> 00:18:44.413]  And anybody who weighs in and bets them,
[00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:47.896]  This time, we'll be held accountable in a court of law.
[00:18:50.316 --> 00:18:51.596]  This is our country, sir.
[00:18:51.976 --> 00:19:00.298]  I mean, if I told you, sir, I can't tell you on the phone with some of the people who have already called me here that are very well entrenched in levels of even government.
[00:19:01.978 --> 00:19:06.079]  Now, the other side knows this, but you guys don't know it yet, but I'll tell you sometime.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:07.860]  And you'll see.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.561]  No, I know that there are millions of people who want a shooting war.
[00:19:12.621 --> 00:19:13.961]  Believe me, I understand that.
[00:19:13.981 --> 00:19:14.121]  I don't.
[00:19:16.076 --> 00:19:22.792]  I don't, but I want these people brought to justice and if they won't turn themselves in voluntarily, I guess we're just going to have to be done the hard way.
[00:19:26.408 --> 00:19:32.914]  I just hope the average American listening knows that if all this goes down, a lot of their pretty little world is going to go away very quickly.
[00:19:32.934 --> 00:19:39.960]  I don't think a lot of Americans realize, as the Southern Poverty Law Center does, that this could start a revolution in this country.
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.922]  Edwin Brown, stay right there.
[00:19:41.942 --> 00:19:42.522]  We've got a break.
[00:19:42.542 --> 00:19:44.244]  I want to come back and ask you a few more questions.
[00:19:44.284 --> 00:19:49.068]  We're all praying for you for a constitutional ending to this and for a peaceful ending to this.
[00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:53.414]  We're just putting our brains together here today trying to figure out a way out of this.
[00:19:54.094 --> 00:19:54.775]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:19:54.795 --> 00:19:58.819]  We're talking to Ed Delaney Brown with the ongoing standoff in New Hampshire.
[00:20:02.754 --> 00:20:04.816]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:14.365]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.825 --> 00:20:22.012]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.732 --> 00:20:28.215]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.715 --> 00:20:39.541]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.301 --> 00:20:42.362]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:20:47.705 --> 00:20:48.845]  We're good to go.
[00:21:16.816 --> 00:21:22.520]  60% of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[00:21:22.641 --> 00:21:26.283]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels switching dollar to yen.
[00:21:26.363 --> 00:21:27.284]  Bad news for U.S.
[00:21:27.344 --> 00:21:27.784]  currency.
[00:21:28.045 --> 00:21:30.186]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[00:21:30.366 --> 00:21:31.807]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[00:21:32.048 --> 00:21:34.149]  Dollars fall into 65% of euro.
[00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:35.330]  Erosion accelerates.
[00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.570]  That's 800-686-2237

[00:23:52.312 --> 00:23:58.175]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade
[00:24:24.221 --> 00:24:25.782]  The illegal aliens get amnesty.
[00:24:25.842 --> 00:24:27.523]  Hardcore, aggravated felons.
[00:24:27.563 --> 00:24:28.484]  Child molesters.
[00:24:28.624 --> 00:24:31.205]  I've got the bill right in front of me.
[00:24:31.245 --> 00:24:32.386]  It actually says it.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.061]  They get tax amnesty, but not Edna Lynn Brown.
[00:24:58.382 --> 00:25:01.703]  No, the paramilitary is going to go in there and they're going to kill everybody in that building.
[00:25:01.723 --> 00:25:05.044]  And they're going to sit up there and be heroes on the news for doing it.
[00:25:07.645 --> 00:25:08.726]  God help this country.
[00:25:09.086 --> 00:25:09.566]  God help it.
[00:25:09.586 --> 00:25:17.709]  I want to tell all the government people, don't you understand that you're being used, that they are literally sucking this country dry right now while you do all this?
[00:25:17.729 --> 00:25:19.169]  A lot of you don't care.
[00:25:19.189 --> 00:25:20.070]  You just want the power.
[00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.710]  You enjoy it.
[00:25:21.292 --> 00:25:24.074]  You say, yeah, we know the government's evil, that's why we're on the winning side.
[00:25:24.414 --> 00:25:26.095]  No, you're on the losing side.
[00:25:26.895 --> 00:25:38.422]  If you're not David Rockefeller or Lord Rothschild, if you don't literally live in armored fortresses and have overseas command bases and offshore islands and your own security details and Swiss bank accounts, you don't win.
[00:25:38.483 --> 00:25:41.284]  You're with us whether you like it or not, you fools.
[00:25:42.405 --> 00:25:44.426]  Ed and Elaine Brown, where is all this going?
[00:25:44.486 --> 00:25:46.687]  I mean, I keep saying that.
[00:25:47.108 --> 00:25:48.108]  How do we avert this?
[00:25:48.168 --> 00:25:48.909]  Because it's clear
[00:25:50.038 --> 00:25:51.939]  That the Feds are doing probes.
[00:25:52.419 --> 00:25:53.359]  They are probing you.
[00:25:53.399 --> 00:25:54.700]  They are planning to go in there.
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:55.460]  That's obvious.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.881]  There's a massive federal buildup in your town.
[00:25:58.401 --> 00:26:00.142]  Where do you see this going, Edna Lane Brown?
[00:26:01.742 --> 00:26:04.003]  Well, I guess that's up to them, Alex.
[00:26:05.384 --> 00:26:07.184]  We will not deviate from our stand.
[00:26:08.525 --> 00:26:11.186]  But, you know, they can kill our bodies.
[00:26:13.126 --> 00:26:17.548]  But sooner or later, we all stand in judgment before the high judge.
[00:26:18.504 --> 00:26:21.967]  And these people will have to answer for what they have done.
[00:26:24.109 --> 00:26:26.171]  We have no qualms about what our answer will be.
[00:26:26.631 --> 00:26:27.612]  We know we are righteous.
[00:26:28.353 --> 00:26:29.494]  We have never harmed anyone.
[00:26:31.095 --> 00:26:37.181]  But they will have to stand there before the Lord and admit that they took part in murdering innocent people.
[00:26:38.602 --> 00:26:41.925]  So I guess it's up to God what's going to happen.
[00:26:44.184 --> 00:26:54.629]  By the way, I meant to get into a bunch of other news issues today, and I had hoped this would de-escalate, but them cutting the power right after you talk to that spook really shows this could be a major sign.
[00:26:54.649 --> 00:27:00.192]  It is a major sign of escalation, but it could be a sign of the final escalation, God forbid.
[00:27:00.212 --> 00:27:03.054]  Let's get Jack McClimb on right now, or line him up for later.
[00:27:03.394 --> 00:27:07.276]  I wanted to have open phones today, get into the immigration bill, which is not dead.
[00:27:07.656 --> 00:27:11.498]  That is a false report by the media to have you stand down, everybody.
[00:27:12.262 --> 00:27:13.722]  I've got a bunch of other news here.
[00:27:14.822 --> 00:27:16.463]  Ed, we are praying for you.
[00:27:16.843 --> 00:27:21.264]  I know Matt Kaziz, who's an independent reporter, has his own 9-11 Truth Group.
[00:27:21.604 --> 00:27:26.444]  He's also reported 4infowars.com on the Virginia Tech shooting because he lives there on the campus.
[00:27:27.825 --> 00:27:28.845]  We've got him online.
[00:27:28.865 --> 00:27:33.966]  I know he's trying to set up some wireless internet cameras, but we've got reports they've been jamming those as well.
[00:27:34.366 --> 00:27:34.946]  Yes, they have.
[00:27:37.826 --> 00:27:38.747]  You say, yes, they have?
[00:27:39.147 --> 00:27:39.747]  That's correct.
[00:27:39.787 --> 00:27:40.747]  They have been jamming them.
[00:27:41.448 --> 00:27:43.769]  They're jamming all cell phones and cell communications.
[00:27:44.249 --> 00:27:44.589]  Correct.
[00:27:47.349 --> 00:27:49.170]  So he hasn't been able to get through with it yet.
[00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:50.210]  He's still trying.
[00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:54.331]  I wonder why they... I think he was able to get through to someone a few minutes ago.
[00:27:54.391 --> 00:27:54.731]  Oh, did he?
[00:27:54.811 --> 00:27:55.011]  Yeah.
[00:27:55.211 --> 00:27:55.391]  Yeah.
[00:27:55.471 --> 00:27:56.912]  It looks like, yeah.
[00:27:57.332 --> 00:28:00.232]  I wonder why they turn the phones on and off, the power on and off.
[00:28:00.252 --> 00:28:02.413]  Is that just the... Oh, it's psychobabble stuff.
[00:28:02.473 --> 00:28:03.893]  It's to show you they're in control.
[00:28:04.393 --> 00:28:04.714]  Yeah.
[00:28:04.834 --> 00:28:05.094]  Yeah.
[00:28:05.114 --> 00:28:06.394]  They're not in control of anything.
[00:28:08.094 --> 00:28:08.874]  They just think they are.
[00:28:11.741 --> 00:28:17.045]  The thing that's in play, Alex, is that the game board is all set.
[00:28:18.846 --> 00:28:20.507]  It's like tennis, back and forth.
[00:28:20.527 --> 00:28:22.949]  They hit the ball, we hit the ball, they hit the ball, we hit the ball.
[00:28:23.369 --> 00:28:24.670]  Now it's in their court to do the thing.
[00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:27.492]  If they're going to do their dirty deed, they're going to do their dirty deed.
[00:28:27.552 --> 00:28:29.233]  Then, of course, they'll come back at them.
[00:28:29.714 --> 00:28:31.115]  That's a matter of choice.
[00:28:31.935 --> 00:28:37.019]  So, hey, all I say is if they do that, these locals that don't protect us,
[00:28:37.657 --> 00:28:38.877]  I feel sorry for them, too.
[00:28:39.317 --> 00:28:42.878]  Their job is to protect us at any and all cost.
[00:28:42.918 --> 00:28:48.459]  Getting back to this Fed, what was he like when he was in your place and then on the phone he later just called you guys wimps, chilling?
[00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:49.440]  Oh, he was a jerk.
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:55.521]  I mean, he was a typical, typical macho, high testosterone, a pretty boy, you know, a fat pretty boy.
[00:28:55.541 --> 00:28:56.461]  No, he wasn't pretty.
[00:28:56.481 --> 00:28:58.882]  He was like a hillbilly.
[00:28:58.902 --> 00:29:00.102]  He's dressed like a hillbilly.
[00:29:00.382 --> 00:29:01.902]  A hillbilly's not like that.
[00:29:01.982 --> 00:29:04.943]  I mean, this guy, his hillbilly outfit,
[00:29:05.424 --> 00:29:06.684]  Well, you have to be to be evil.
[00:29:27.466 --> 00:29:29.827]  Now, this one, these guys don't want to walk away, okay?
[00:29:30.067 --> 00:29:32.067]  Well, one more segment, please, Ed and Elaine Brown.
[00:29:32.147 --> 00:29:34.428]  It looks like things may be escalating again.
[00:29:34.468 --> 00:29:38.189]  We pray that's not the case, but it is what it is, as they say.
[00:29:38.769 --> 00:29:46.331]  And we'll get a report from Matt Kazee, independent reporter, there inside the compound, as it's been dehumanized to be known as.
[00:29:46.732 --> 00:29:47.412]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.713 --> 00:29:52.673]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.113 --> 00:29:54.614]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.615 --> 00:29:58.396]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.657 --> 00:30:04.398]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?

[00:30:54.658 --> 00:30:55.318]  Do it today!
[00:31:01.062 --> 00:31:06.024]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming and the end of the world?
[00:31:06.344 --> 00:31:08.225]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[00:31:08.405 --> 00:31:11.467]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:31:11.627 --> 00:31:14.768]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:31:15.088 --> 00:31:16.869]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[00:31:16.869 --> 00:31:17.450]  We're good to go.
[00:31:33.644 --> 00:31:37.987]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[00:31:38.287 --> 00:31:42.549]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[00:31:42.869 --> 00:31:48.753]  You will receive information regarding America and prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[00:31:49.053 --> 00:31:51.494]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.

[00:31:52.215 --> 00:31:53.315]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[00:32:01.201 --> 00:32:05.242]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:32:05.462 --> 00:32:08.863]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:32:09.043 --> 00:32:12.544]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:32:12.784 --> 00:32:16.045]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:32:16.065 --> 00:32:21.526]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[00:32:21.547 --> 00:32:26.768]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[00:32:27.128 --> 00:32:27.889]  We're good to go!
[00:32:44.648 --> 00:32:48.669]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:32:48.989 --> 00:32:50.469]  That toll free number again?
[00:32:50.489 --> 00:32:50.549]  1-877-928-8822.
[00:32:50.569 --> 00:32:52.430]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[00:33:16.892 --> 00:33:17.352]  Sean?
[00:33:54.954 --> 00:33:57.918]  I'm looking at the bill, the amnesty bill that's not dead.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:03.205]  We paid for their immigration lawyers, so they don't have to pay their back taxes.
[00:34:06.059 --> 00:34:10.740]  They don't have to, they can have terrorism connections, they can be convicted, aggravated, child molesters.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.381]  We need to do an article about this.
[00:34:13.501 --> 00:34:21.343]  Contrasting the illegal aliens, because they're here to bring down the wages, they're here to bring down the United States, the North American Union.
[00:34:21.843 --> 00:34:28.725]  Not blaming them individually, this is just how they're being used as a tool by the globalists, a literal fire hose, a strip mine.
[00:34:29.365 --> 00:34:31.725]  Our society just blasting out the middle class.
[00:34:34.747 --> 00:34:41.230]  But then you've got a family who's there to be sucked off of, and they ask for the law, and the government says, we're going to show you the law, we're going to show you force.
[00:34:43.471 --> 00:34:54.997]  Going back to Ed and Elaine Brown, any other points you want to make, any other, I mean, going into this, do you think they're going to come in on you now, or you don't have any idea, or what does this mean, they've cut your power again, or what has this meant in the past?
[00:34:55.717 --> 00:34:57.858]  Alex, it's not good to second guess anything.
[00:34:58.695 --> 00:34:59.016]  Okay?
[00:34:59.056 --> 00:35:00.497]  You just wait for it to come.
[00:35:00.537 --> 00:35:01.859]  Don't get yourself upset.
[00:35:01.879 --> 00:35:02.580]  Stay cool.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.040]  Relax.
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:03.501]  Okay?
[00:35:03.561 --> 00:35:03.861]  It comes.
[00:35:03.921 --> 00:35:04.241]  It comes.
[00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:05.243]  If it doesn't, it doesn't.
[00:35:05.283 --> 00:35:06.724]  I'm not going to get all wired up about it.
[00:35:07.485 --> 00:35:07.926]  What for?
[00:35:07.986 --> 00:35:10.809]  I've been in the streets for too many years with these people.
[00:35:11.169 --> 00:35:12.030]  The people like this.
[00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.571]  You know?
[00:35:13.712 --> 00:35:14.213]  Big deal.
[00:35:15.314 --> 00:35:16.896]  Hey, they bleed the same way we do.
[00:35:19.161 --> 00:35:20.481]  They suffer the same way we do.
[00:35:20.521 --> 00:35:21.522]  They have the same anguishes.
[00:35:21.542 --> 00:35:22.642]  They're no different than we are.
[00:35:22.662 --> 00:35:24.943]  They're not this big, omnipotent group of people.
[00:35:25.423 --> 00:35:27.484]  They have families and homes just like we do.
[00:35:28.024 --> 00:35:29.044]  Ed, let me say this.
[00:35:29.364 --> 00:35:30.285]  We'll learn where they live.
[00:35:30.805 --> 00:35:31.585]  Ed, let me say this.
[00:35:32.165 --> 00:35:40.608]  Obviously, they now admit they had snipers Thursday or Wednesday around the property already aiming their firearms at you.
[00:35:41.068 --> 00:35:41.708]  Correct.
[00:35:41.868 --> 00:35:44.149]  Are you worried about just walking around your front yard?
[00:35:44.169 --> 00:35:45.149]  Because I know you do that every day.
[00:35:45.169 --> 00:35:47.650]  Alex, we aren't worried about anything.
[00:35:48.331 --> 00:35:50.752]  I'm not worried about dying, so why would anything else worry?
[00:35:50.772 --> 00:35:55.253]  Well, just so you know, and I mean, you say not, you know, second guess, but I'm here trying to analyze what I think is going to happen.
[00:35:55.613 --> 00:36:07.215]  There's a very good chance that they may make the decision to just gun you and your wife down and anybody else outside, and then probably drag your bodies inside and set the house on fire to claim you burned yourselves up.
[00:36:07.416 --> 00:36:08.076]  Impossible!
[00:36:08.176 --> 00:36:12.777]  For the record, under no circumstance would my wife and I ever commit suicide.
[00:36:13.317 --> 00:36:16.318]  We will kill as many of them people that attack us as possible.
[00:36:16.398 --> 00:36:16.758]  How's that?
[00:36:16.778 --> 00:36:17.838]  Is that clear enough?
[00:36:19.502 --> 00:36:21.843]  We'll try to stay alive as long as possible.
[00:36:23.104 --> 00:36:24.845]  We're about living, not about dying.
[00:36:26.165 --> 00:36:27.226]  We want to go back to work.
[00:36:27.286 --> 00:36:28.366]  She wants to go back to work.
[00:36:28.406 --> 00:36:29.187]  I want to go back to work.
[00:36:29.527 --> 00:36:30.487]  I want to be left alone.
[00:36:30.708 --> 00:36:31.808]  There's no crimes here.
[00:36:31.828 --> 00:36:32.769]  There's no criminals here.
[00:36:32.789 --> 00:36:37.411]  The only criminals are in those BDU uniforms, battle dress uniforms.
[00:36:38.086 --> 00:36:43.767]  The federal corporate structure along with the criminal state police and the criminal local police allowing this to happen.
[00:36:43.807 --> 00:36:47.468]  And the sheriff's department who keeps disappearing every time one of these things comes up.
[00:36:47.809 --> 00:36:50.149]  Yeah, and the sheriff's out of town at the moment, I think.
[00:36:50.189 --> 00:36:51.149]  Again, he's out of town.
[00:36:51.189 --> 00:36:52.950]  Every time one of these things comes up, he disappears.
[00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:55.631]  Uh-oh, so that even escalates this more.
[00:36:55.651 --> 00:36:58.831]  They cut your power like last week, and the sheriff's out of town.
[00:36:58.871 --> 00:37:00.192]  That means they might be moving in on you.
[00:37:00.872 --> 00:37:02.932]  Well, again, Alex, you keep saying that word.
[00:37:03.152 --> 00:37:04.453]  I don't want to even hear that stuff.
[00:37:04.473 --> 00:37:04.933]  Who cares?
[00:37:06.161 --> 00:37:07.582]  You know, I'm not interested.
[00:37:07.782 --> 00:37:10.164]  That's the kind of talk that they use against us.
[00:37:10.404 --> 00:37:13.186]  The only people that have been talking that way, I think I'm going to come and get you.
[00:37:13.226 --> 00:37:14.067]  They're going to do this.
[00:37:14.107 --> 00:37:15.808]  They're the feds.
[00:37:15.828 --> 00:37:16.729]  You following me?
[00:37:16.789 --> 00:37:20.712]  But Ed, I'm doing my best to try to warn the people about how serious this situation is.
[00:37:20.752 --> 00:37:21.473]  It's very serious.
[00:37:21.533 --> 00:37:23.094]  So we can avert it.
[00:37:23.154 --> 00:37:26.596]  The people can do the best thing by flooding these people with phone calls.
[00:37:26.617 --> 00:37:33.562]  The Marshal's office, the Governor's office, the Sheriff's office, the Plainfield and Lebanon Police offices.
[00:37:34.022 --> 00:37:34.783]  Call, call, call.
[00:37:34.803 --> 00:37:38.285]  Let them know how many people are up in arms about this.
[00:37:38.305 --> 00:37:39.866]  They're the ones responsible for this.
[00:37:39.886 --> 00:37:40.806]  The local authorities.
[00:37:40.846 --> 00:37:42.447]  The governor is responsible for this.
[00:37:42.788 --> 00:37:44.609]  Well Ed, let's go back specifically.
[00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:48.271]  What is it that I'm saying that is what they're saying?
[00:37:48.291 --> 00:37:49.812]  Because I don't understand what they're saying.
[00:37:49.832 --> 00:37:51.793]  Well, you talk about they're going to come in.
[00:37:51.813 --> 00:37:52.994]  It's imminent and all that.
[00:37:53.034 --> 00:37:53.875]  It's not imminent.
[00:37:53.935 --> 00:37:55.115]  It's not imminent at all.
[00:37:55.135 --> 00:37:59.078]  I mean, they have no idea what's here.
[00:37:59.904 --> 00:38:03.889]  They have no idea what we've established here around the building.
[00:38:04.991 --> 00:38:06.473]  They would be absolutely stupid!
[00:38:07.267 --> 00:38:08.387]  Well, they're stupid anyway.
[00:38:08.928 --> 00:38:13.090]  To come into a situation like that, from a military perspective.
[00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:19.952]  Well, I mean, Ed, to say that it could be imminent, the last time they cut your... I mean, I'm just trying to be honest here.
[00:38:20.333 --> 00:38:22.413]  The last time they... I mean, let's flush this out.
[00:38:22.754 --> 00:38:34.399]  The last time they cut your power, the last time the Sheriff was out of town last week, they moved in a bunch of armored vehicles, aircraft, a whole bunch of state and federal police, and state's really federal too, chartered by Roosevelt in 33,
[00:38:35.619 --> 00:38:50.852]  All of this happened, and in a way I have said that they will over and over again make it look like they're going to attack you until people finally kind of stand down being conditioned by it, being acclimated, and then they will move in on you.
[00:38:50.892 --> 00:38:53.474]  But I'm wanting people to know that this is serious.
[00:38:53.534 --> 00:38:55.375]  I mean, you don't want us to say that it's serious?
[00:38:55.996 --> 00:38:57.397]  Well, no, not that at all.
[00:38:57.417 --> 00:39:03.242]  It's just that to hear it from our perspective, to hear that over and over again is very weary
[00:39:04.417 --> 00:39:04.997]  You follow me?
[00:39:05.358 --> 00:39:07.199]  Well, let me tell you, it's weary to me.
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:11.082]  I'm on the outside of this and I was exhausted this weekend.
[00:39:11.403 --> 00:39:13.064]  I mean, we're okay here.
[00:39:13.444 --> 00:39:16.967]  I mean, even to the point of death, we're okay here, but they can kill us.
[00:39:17.007 --> 00:39:18.348]  We can't stop them about that.
[00:39:18.588 --> 00:39:19.789]  We can't stop them from doing that.
[00:39:19.909 --> 00:39:23.572]  It's impossible for us to stop anybody from killing you if they really want to kill you.
[00:39:23.912 --> 00:39:27.275]  Ed, do you think I should not make a big deal out of this?
[00:39:27.295 --> 00:39:29.557]  No, but I don't want to hear it.
[00:39:31.255 --> 00:39:31.655]  Okay.
[00:39:32.276 --> 00:39:34.177]  You know, I just, I don't want to do it.
[00:39:35.278 --> 00:39:35.759]  That's all.
[00:39:35.799 --> 00:39:41.363]  I mean, I've got enough to think about here without having my friends constantly remind me about the danger of it to me.
[00:39:41.383 --> 00:39:42.844]  Yeah, we know we are in danger.
[00:39:42.864 --> 00:39:43.925]  We know we're in danger.
[00:39:43.965 --> 00:39:47.208]  We're in extreme danger here because these people are not normal.
[00:39:47.248 --> 00:39:51.531]  We're very appreciative, Alex, of all the publicity you have given us.
[00:39:51.651 --> 00:39:54.694]  Believe me, believe me, it has helped so much.
[00:39:55.274 --> 00:39:55.795]  Yes, it has.
[00:39:56.534 --> 00:40:01.077]  Well, I mean, I'm just trying to keep you... I mean, I understand you guys are committed, and you don't want to hear about what could happen.
[00:40:01.137 --> 00:40:02.097]  I mean, I know you live it every day.
[00:40:02.117 --> 00:40:02.798]  You're sick of it.
[00:40:03.178 --> 00:40:04.819]  Thank you.
[00:40:04.879 --> 00:40:09.522]  I mean, you know, certain things, even if it's innocuous and not something threatening like this, it happens over and over again.
[00:40:09.542 --> 00:40:12.023]  You know, it turns into a pet peeve.
[00:40:12.304 --> 00:40:15.566]  But, I mean, I was making that statement to the listeners, because I think a lot of them... I know you were.
[00:40:15.686 --> 00:40:16.186]  I know you were.
[00:40:16.206 --> 00:40:25.852]  Some of them have emailed me, and they're believing the propaganda of the federal marshals and the FBI, saying there was no plan to go in, you're not under surveillance, there are no snipers, and we know that's bull.
[00:40:26.451 --> 00:40:26.871]  That's right.
[00:40:27.072 --> 00:40:27.272]  Yeah.
[00:40:27.732 --> 00:40:27.953]  It is.
[00:40:28.273 --> 00:40:28.713]  It is.
[00:40:28.733 --> 00:40:29.034]  You're right.
[00:40:29.234 --> 00:40:29.534]  You're right.
[00:40:29.654 --> 00:40:30.035]  No, no.
[00:40:30.075 --> 00:40:30.415]  You're right.
[00:40:30.615 --> 00:40:30.875]  Yeah.
[00:40:30.915 --> 00:40:31.236]  She's right.
[00:40:31.256 --> 00:40:31.556]  You're right.
[00:40:32.537 --> 00:40:32.877]  She's right.
[00:40:32.917 --> 00:40:33.638]  You're right, Alex.
[00:40:33.658 --> 00:40:35.400]  But I don't blame you for being irritated by it.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:39.384]  I mean, I would be more than... I'd probably be screaming and yelling if I was in your position.
[00:40:39.424 --> 00:40:46.691]  But just in closing, obviously, here on the Genesis Network and other networks, we'll follow what happens throughout the day and throughout the week.
[00:40:46.731 --> 00:40:47.752]  I pray to God nothing
[00:40:48.232 --> 00:40:51.394]  Nothing happens, and it probably won't come a day or tomorrow or next week.
[00:40:51.414 --> 00:40:55.557]  It'll probably come once people are all worn out from this, but it's a catch-22.
[00:40:55.617 --> 00:41:04.003]  We have to cover it when it looks like it's escalating again, but if we continue to cover it, it's like crying wolf, and then it won't have a bigger response a month from now.
[00:41:04.564 --> 00:41:05.184]  Sure.
[00:41:05.444 --> 00:41:05.925]  That's okay.
[00:41:05.965 --> 00:41:13.710]  If everybody gets quiet again, that's okay, because it only takes a matter of a few minutes for everything to increase quickly, globally.
[00:41:15.311 --> 00:41:17.113]  There's more than one way to skin a cat, Alex.
[00:41:17.153 --> 00:41:17.673]  You know that.
[00:41:18.686 --> 00:41:20.868]  There's more than one way for communication.
[00:41:22.529 --> 00:41:23.690]  Well, you're right about that.
[00:41:24.251 --> 00:41:30.456]  Now, Ed, how close are your closest neighbors?
[00:41:30.476 --> 00:41:31.037]  1,500 feet.
[00:41:32.578 --> 00:41:39.043]  Maybe we should get their names and numbers in case they do cut off all communication and then we just have to wait hours.
[00:41:39.064 --> 00:41:42.126]  I think they're too terrified to even cooperate with anything.
[00:41:42.146 --> 00:41:44.468]  I think if you call them up, they wouldn't say defense.
[00:41:44.488 --> 00:41:46.490]  I'm sure I've already talked to them, but maybe not.
[00:41:47.205 --> 00:41:49.367]  Maybe Larry would have a good chance.
[00:41:50.288 --> 00:41:51.089]  Who knows?
[00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:54.032]  They've probably gone on an extended paid vacation.
[00:41:54.052 --> 00:41:55.954]  There's probably feds in there right now.
[00:41:56.594 --> 00:41:57.936]  Yeah, in their house, in their home.
[00:41:58.356 --> 00:41:59.017]  Yeah, you don't know.
[00:42:00.679 --> 00:42:05.203]  Well, no, I mean, with Waco and other events, they do take over the nearby houses.
[00:42:05.523 --> 00:42:05.724]  Yeah.
[00:42:05.944 --> 00:42:08.687]  Well, we forgot to tell you, we had some business who wanted to rent the
[00:42:09.546 --> 00:42:15.851]  Let the land, the office building down there for, um, and I know Don right well that that wasn't true.
[00:42:15.891 --> 00:42:18.493]  That was more federal agents coming in.
[00:42:18.734 --> 00:42:19.394]  I cannot believe it.
[00:42:19.414 --> 00:42:22.857]  We're going to verify that this afternoon and I'll confirm that with you next time I talk to you.
[00:42:24.329 --> 00:42:27.572]  Well, how dumb do they think the public is that they're there with all this force?
[00:42:27.612 --> 00:42:30.374]  They had snipers in there Wednesday and Thursday.
[00:42:30.434 --> 00:42:31.595]  They shot at somebody.
[00:42:31.615 --> 00:42:34.217]  And then they tell the media, oh, we're not going to use force.
[00:42:34.237 --> 00:42:35.157]  We're not going in.
[00:42:35.558 --> 00:42:38.620]  They're obviously about to go in, or we're thinking about it.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:39.541]  Sure they were.
[00:42:39.861 --> 00:42:43.243]  They were coming down that morning to do us in, one way or the other.
[00:42:44.104 --> 00:42:45.565]  But they get caught at the end of the driveway.
[00:42:45.625 --> 00:42:49.388]  I heard the shots, so they knew immediately that I was alerted here.
[00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:54.753]  But I wasn't quite sure until a dog came ripping down the driveway a few seconds later.
[00:42:54.773 --> 00:42:56.254]  I said, oops, something's wrong.
[00:42:56.314 --> 00:42:56.734]  That did it.
[00:42:57.935 --> 00:43:00.877]  Thank God for the dog and thank God for Danny Riley.
[00:43:02.558 --> 00:43:05.160]  Even, you know, considering what he went through, poor Danny.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:05.480]  Yeah.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.141]  But he saved our lives.
[00:43:07.501 --> 00:43:08.422]  I'm convinced of that.
[00:43:08.442 --> 00:43:15.987]  So am I. Well, I'll tell you this, Mac Aziz has got a lot of courage being there and I want to go to him in just one moment.
[00:43:16.007 --> 00:43:17.387]  We still have Mac Aziz, correct?
[00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:18.108]  Yes.
[00:43:18.812 --> 00:43:20.213]  We're going to go to Matt here in just a moment.
[00:43:20.553 --> 00:43:24.694]  Just in closing with Ed and Elaine Brown, they're literally facing the jaws of the new law.
[00:43:24.714 --> 00:43:26.295]  I'm sorry, I don't know if you have Matt or not, do you?
[00:43:27.255 --> 00:43:28.136]  Yes, we have him online.
[00:43:29.136 --> 00:43:33.298]  Ed, I was talking to the fellow running the show, sorry, not you.
[00:43:34.258 --> 00:43:39.440]  Sometimes people think I'm talking to myself here, but I've had emails, who are you talking to on the show when nobody answers back?
[00:43:41.101 --> 00:43:42.181]  They're talking to me in my headset.
[00:43:43.397 --> 00:43:44.918]  Any other tidbits of info?
[00:43:44.978 --> 00:43:49.380]  Any little pieces of intel on this fella that came in that called himself Rip?
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.681]  I'm sure that was a joke of rest in peace.
[00:43:51.721 --> 00:43:55.943]  Some little, you know, macabre allusion that they were throwing at you, thinking you're stupid.
[00:43:56.343 --> 00:44:00.806]  Yeah, he was saying something later about his family name being Van Winkle or something.
[00:44:00.866 --> 00:44:04.187]  I mean, it was... He was really strange.
[00:44:04.387 --> 00:44:07.829]  They don't realize how strange they really come across, the normal people.
[00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:13.067]  So he was, I'm sure, real nervous of trying to put the fake happy act on it or something?
[00:44:13.127 --> 00:44:13.687]  Exactly.
[00:44:14.108 --> 00:44:15.348]  That's exactly what he was trying to do.
[00:44:15.888 --> 00:44:19.749]  But I couldn't help it because when people irritate me, I jump on them and he was irritating me.
[00:44:20.229 --> 00:44:22.370]  So I was jumping on him yesterday, you know?
[00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:24.471]  Was he armed?
[00:44:24.491 --> 00:44:26.191]  Oh, I'm sure.
[00:44:27.452 --> 00:44:30.753]  You couldn't see with all his baggy clothes that he had on, trying to look like a hillbilly.
[00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:39.332]  Yeah, but he came in and the first thing he said was that he noticed the guns and he doesn't like guns.
[00:44:39.352 --> 00:44:42.173]  Yeah, hillbillies usually don't talk too much, the ones I know.
[00:44:42.213 --> 00:44:42.814]  No, that's right.
[00:44:43.074 --> 00:44:43.934]  He couldn't shut up.
[00:44:44.274 --> 00:44:45.094]  He couldn't shut this guy up.
[00:44:45.114 --> 00:44:46.615]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:48.559 --> 00:44:48.799]  Okay.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.560]  Well, absolutely amazing.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.561]  Anything else he said?
[00:44:51.621 --> 00:44:59.006]  I mean, to be clear, because we're going to write an article about this, he later called you back and then was like basically showing himself to be a Fed.
[00:44:59.026 --> 00:45:01.448]  That was this morning, just before they killed the power.
[00:45:01.948 --> 00:45:06.931]  He said, one minute before they killed the power, you said, now is that a literal minute or a figurative minute?
[00:45:06.952 --> 00:45:07.872]  I mean, just basically a minute?
[00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:09.033]  About a minute.
[00:45:09.313 --> 00:45:13.316]  Approximately one minute later, yeah, the power went off after he hung up the phone.
[00:45:13.636 --> 00:45:14.937]  He didn't want to talk about it because
[00:45:15.492 --> 00:45:16.012]  So basically, he was
[00:45:35.374 --> 00:45:38.295]  I mean, I want to get this specifically down, word for word, if you can, Ed.
[00:45:38.715 --> 00:45:52.798]  When he started saying, you Rangers are nothing, the Constitutional Rangers, as you, you know, the group you're a part of, or, or, or, I mean, what's your, you know, the mantle you've basically taken on, the identity, and I understand that, uh, he was saying, you guys are nothing, you're wimps, or what, I mean, was he threatening you?
[00:45:52.838 --> 00:45:53.378]  What was he saying?
[00:45:53.718 --> 00:45:53.898]  Yeah.
[00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:55.858]  Basically, that's what he was saying.
[00:45:55.898 --> 00:45:57.839]  He said, you know, you, you, the Rangers are nothing.
[00:45:57.859 --> 00:45:58.639]  They're like little wimps.
[00:45:58.659 --> 00:45:59.759]  They're like toilet paper.
[00:46:00.299 --> 00:46:02.119]  I said, yeah, well, Rangers are all soft.
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:04.820]  I said, but it's not the Rangers you have to worry about.
[00:46:09.189 --> 00:46:10.189]  And then he hung up the phone.
[00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:16.212]  Well, we know when they're out front, they're covering their faces, and they are rightfully concerned.
[00:46:16.752 --> 00:46:19.193]  I mean, believe me, gentlemen, I'll tell you this.
[00:46:19.294 --> 00:46:20.514]  I don't see you as toilet paper.
[00:46:20.534 --> 00:46:25.076]  I see you as misguided people who aren't part of the real warrior class.
[00:46:25.096 --> 00:46:26.537]  No, no, you misunderstood.
[00:46:26.597 --> 00:46:29.478]  He said that the Rangers, my guys, are
[00:46:31.556 --> 00:46:32.196]  Toilet paper.
[00:46:32.256 --> 00:46:33.277]  No, no, I understand that.
[00:46:34.057 --> 00:46:41.820]  I'm saying to them that I see them as poor, destroyed human beings who at the end of their lives are going to be very, very ashamed of themselves.
[00:46:42.601 --> 00:46:45.002]  And I just wish they'd come over and join us.
[00:46:45.342 --> 00:46:48.303]  I just really, because they will not hurt the New World Order.
[00:46:48.363 --> 00:46:50.264]  I mean, they're calling you toilet paper.
[00:46:50.624 --> 00:46:57.447]  I hope they know that David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger have made public statements about how the police and military are animals.
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:02.903]  And that they use you, and just they think nothing of you and your family.
[00:47:02.923 --> 00:47:17.792]  So I just can't believe these men... Out of respect to some of them, I was contacted this morning by some of them, and they clearly identified themselves and their position as being with us.
[00:47:19.192 --> 00:47:19.533]  Okay?
[00:47:21.594 --> 00:47:23.135]  So you've had other feds calling you?
[00:47:23.155 --> 00:47:23.255]  Yes.
[00:47:23.715 --> 00:47:23.955]  No.
[00:47:25.376 --> 00:47:26.657]  But law enforcement, yes.
[00:47:28.755 --> 00:47:28.995]  Yeah.
[00:47:29.756 --> 00:47:30.056]  Okay.
[00:47:30.396 --> 00:47:32.177]  Well, let me just say this is not going to be good.
[00:47:32.197 --> 00:47:34.878]  I hope these federal idiots know they're being used by the feds.
[00:47:35.338 --> 00:47:37.139]  I hope they know they're being used as a pawn.
[00:47:37.159 --> 00:47:38.400]  They know.
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:44.023]  And if they take you, I hope they know that that's for a larger setup to try to put the country in checkmate.
[00:47:44.523 --> 00:47:44.943]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.163 --> 00:47:46.724]  That's what this is all about, isn't it, Alex?
[00:47:46.984 --> 00:47:48.605]  The whole country, not just Ed and Elaine.
[00:47:49.025 --> 00:47:49.545]  The heck with us.
[00:47:49.585 --> 00:47:50.126]  We're nothing.
[00:47:50.686 --> 00:47:53.007]  Well, let's just say there's a very good chance.
[00:47:53.087 --> 00:47:56.449]  It's like dancing around in a fireworks factory with a torch.
[00:47:57.094 --> 00:47:58.135]  That's exactly right.
[00:48:24.955 --> 00:48:29.177]  And I love my family, and I love this country, and I just want to beat the New World Order.
[00:48:29.678 --> 00:48:34.240]  And I want to continue our peaceful info war that is being extremely effective right now.
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.901]  I don't want this country to be brought down.
[00:48:35.921 --> 00:48:38.602]  Ed and Elaine Brown, we will try to stay in contact with you.
[00:48:38.642 --> 00:48:40.363]  You know the network call-in number.
[00:48:40.723 --> 00:48:45.146]  If we're unable to get in touch with you, you've got the back hotline number.
[00:48:45.246 --> 00:48:50.388]  If any of your cell phones are working, so you do have our network number?
[00:48:51.469 --> 00:48:51.569]  Yes.
[00:48:53.431 --> 00:48:54.712]  With the special extension?
[00:48:54.732 --> 00:48:57.733]  Uh, looking right now here.
[00:48:59.554 --> 00:49:01.355]  Please don't give it out on air, folks will start using it.
[00:49:01.495 --> 00:49:08.339]  I'm going to put you on hold and let John Harmon give you that number just in case, a double check, and I'll be praying for you again tonight.
[00:49:08.879 --> 00:49:09.399]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:49:09.479 --> 00:49:10.039]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:49:10.179 --> 00:49:11.420]  Thank you, Ed and Elaine Brown.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:15.922]  Great Americans, and I mean, they're standing up.
[00:49:16.042 --> 00:49:21.205]  They've got courage, they've got guts, and they're in the right, but I
[00:49:22.381 --> 00:49:23.602]  Don't know what this is going to turn into.
[00:49:23.642 --> 00:49:25.363]  This could turn into something really, really bad.
[00:49:25.383 --> 00:49:29.967]  And I just hope that the Feds there walk away.
[00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:33.570]  It's going to put them in danger.
[00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:37.192]  I know they don't care about Ed and Elaine Brown, but it is going to put you in danger.
[00:49:38.173 --> 00:49:38.813]  And what for?
[00:49:40.054 --> 00:49:47.340]  I mean, why didn't you put yourselves in danger at Virginia Tech when the Feds ordered the local police to stand down for over two hours?
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.982]  And then they got there for an hour and a half before they went in.
[00:49:50.976 --> 00:49:52.497]  The shooting started at 7 in the morning.
[00:49:53.377 --> 00:49:54.718]  They didn't go in until past 11.
[00:49:55.339 --> 00:49:55.679]  Central.
[00:49:56.119 --> 00:49:57.200]  These are central times, I guess.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:58.440]  8 in the morning.
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:00.221]  That was 7 in the morning.
[00:50:00.862 --> 00:50:03.203]  And it went until about 10-15 in the morning.
[00:50:04.224 --> 00:50:04.564]  Eastern.
[00:50:05.504 --> 00:50:07.205]  So that'd be 8-15 to 11-15.
[00:50:07.806 --> 00:50:08.146]  Central.
[00:50:09.227 --> 00:50:11.408]  You know, you stood behind trees, you sat there and cowered.
[00:50:11.768 --> 00:50:12.949]  I mean, I'm not even a tough guy.
[00:50:13.369 --> 00:50:20.173]  But if some scumbag had a little girl kidnapped and had already shot some people or something, was down the street and the cops were standing around,
[00:50:21.542 --> 00:50:25.866]  I wouldn't rush in and save her because I know the cops would shoot me in the back because, oh my God, somebody with a gun is going in.
[00:50:25.906 --> 00:50:26.666]  We can't allow that.
[00:50:27.006 --> 00:50:28.668]  It's the coward's move to shoot somebody in the back.
[00:50:28.708 --> 00:50:34.312]  It wouldn't be like Austin, Texas back in the 60s when that nut was up on the building and citizens went in with the police.
[00:50:35.413 --> 00:50:42.578]  But if the police were standing down and I had a chance, I mean, I would... I'm drawn towards things like that because I'm a... I've got my head screwed on straight.
[00:50:42.618 --> 00:50:45.300]  I mean, men are designed to want to go in against scum.
[00:50:46.602 --> 00:50:52.508]  But no, you don't go in against somebody killing college students, but you will go in against an old man and an old woman.
[00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:54.791]  And I mean, something's wrong with you.
[00:50:54.831 --> 00:50:56.132]  You got some screw loose.
[00:51:04.753 --> 00:51:10.217]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.597 --> 00:51:18.183]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.911 --> 00:51:25.976]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.376 --> 00:51:37.823]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.103 --> 00:51:41.706]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.066 --> 00:51:44.007]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.347 --> 00:51:48.190]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:23.397 --> 00:53:30.387]  Leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:54:54.156 --> 00:54:54.797]  Welcome back.
[00:54:55.057 --> 00:54:56.138]  We're about to go to Matt Guzzi.
[00:54:56.158 --> 00:54:58.760]  We'll have him with us for about five minutes after in the next hour.
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:00.561]  Continual reports throughout the day.
[00:55:00.601 --> 00:55:02.723]  Jack McClam has come up in about 30 minutes.
[00:55:02.763 --> 00:55:05.405]  I got a bunch of international and national news that must be covered.
[00:55:06.226 --> 00:55:08.368]  And I am going to have open phones too in the next hour.
[00:55:08.848 --> 00:55:15.474]  Meant to do that for all three hours a day, but they've cut the power off again and got people coming in on the property and it's just, it's...
[00:55:17.774 --> 00:55:21.075]  I just wish the globalists would stop pushing, but they're not going to, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:21.535 --> 00:55:25.777]  And make no mistake, if they had the American people's guns, we would look like Nazi Germany right now.
[00:55:27.717 --> 00:55:31.198]  That's how far this tyranny will go, is how far the police and military go along with it.
[00:55:31.458 --> 00:55:33.219]  Don't be like the German military and police.
[00:55:33.259 --> 00:55:34.699]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:55:35.239 --> 00:55:36.780]  Don't wait until our country is destroyed.
[00:55:38.163 --> 00:55:41.705]  Don't wait until they bite off more than you can chew, like Iraq, what's happening right now.
[00:55:41.725 --> 00:55:50.609]  I mean, you think the Iraqis, who can't even shoot straight on average, and have no military training, they don't have rifles put in their hands when they're five years old, like a lot of Americans did?
[00:55:50.629 --> 00:55:53.770]  I mean, do you have any idea what a revolution is going to look like for you?
[00:55:54.271 --> 00:56:01.814]  I've seen the federal war plans, the battle documents, I've talked to top generals who are retired, they plan on a whole bunch of you getting wiped out in the first round.
[00:56:01.834 --> 00:56:05.776]  Alright, I'm already getting off into that, I've just got some, I just can't believe it.
[00:56:06.914 --> 00:56:08.374]  And I just do not want this to happen.
[00:56:08.394 --> 00:56:15.556]  The feds are completely insane.
[00:56:15.576 --> 00:56:17.257]  Down with the low levels.
[00:56:17.277 --> 00:56:19.577]  You guys have no idea what you're part of or how big this is.
[00:56:20.318 --> 00:56:21.398]  How big any of this is.
[00:56:21.698 --> 00:56:23.318]  I hope you're starting to get an inkling.
[00:56:24.159 --> 00:56:29.700]  It made me really feel good when I saw POTOC and the Southern Poverty Law Center going, they need to back off, they need to stop, they don't need to do this.
[00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.381]  Because he knows.
[00:56:32.821 --> 00:56:36.142]  He knows that it's the beginning of the end of you guys.
[00:56:37.748 --> 00:56:38.088]  Fools!
[00:56:38.488 --> 00:56:38.889]  Fools!
[00:56:42.651 --> 00:56:45.633]  Folks, if you haven't gotten storable foods, now is the time.
[00:56:45.953 --> 00:56:49.755]  With the economy, and martial law, and revolution.
[00:56:50.536 --> 00:56:53.037]  Plus, I mean, I was buying storable foods 7, 8, 9 years ago.
[00:56:53.057 --> 00:56:55.919]  I guess 8 years ago I first started buying some.
[00:56:55.939 --> 00:56:57.920]  And eFoods Direct, I got a year's supply from them.
[00:56:57.981 --> 00:56:59.642]  It's the best quality storable food I've ever gotten.
[00:56:59.662 --> 00:57:05.045]  That's because they're the oldest and most established, ongoing, continually operating company in the nation.
[00:57:06.094 --> 00:57:07.795]  Steve Shank has got the highest standards.
[00:57:07.835 --> 00:57:08.435]  Give him a call.
[00:57:08.455 --> 00:57:08.815]  1-800-409-5633.
[00:57:08.835 --> 00:57:08.895]  1-800-409-5633.
[00:57:08.915 --> 00:57:08.995]  Call.
[00:57:09.055 --> 00:57:09.815]  Get a free catalog.
[00:57:09.835 --> 00:57:10.675]  Talk to Steve Shank.
[00:57:10.715 --> 00:57:11.396]  Get a month's supply.
[00:57:11.456 --> 00:57:14.076]  Get a year's supply.
[00:57:14.156 --> 00:57:14.857]  Get a three-year supply.
[00:57:14.877 --> 00:57:15.717]  It's very inexpensive.
[00:57:23.972 --> 00:57:24.893]  And it's organic.
[00:57:24.913 --> 00:57:26.274]  It doesn't have cheap fillers in it.
[00:57:26.654 --> 00:57:28.055]  It's the highest quality.
[00:57:28.375 --> 00:57:29.656]  This is what my family has.
[00:57:30.017 --> 00:57:30.477]  You need it.
[00:57:30.497 --> 00:57:30.877]  1-800-409-5633.
[00:57:30.957 --> 00:57:33.919]  And in 4 or 5 years, it lasts for 10 years, but 4 or 5 years, give it to the food bank and buy more.
[00:57:33.939 --> 00:57:34.520]  That's what I do.
[00:57:39.887 --> 00:57:41.228]  And, uh, just, or eat it.
[00:57:41.288 --> 00:57:42.628]  You know, take some of it with you on camping trips.
[00:57:42.688 --> 00:57:43.028]  It's great.
[00:57:43.048 --> 00:57:43.529]  1-800-409-5633.
[00:57:43.609 --> 00:57:48.371]  By the way, I know a lot of police departments have MREs for what's coming.
[00:57:48.391 --> 00:57:49.071]  I know you've been buying them.
[00:57:49.531 --> 00:57:52.112]  You shouldn't, the police departments, you should have this type of stuff.
[00:57:52.332 --> 00:57:53.353]  Good quality foods.
[00:57:53.713 --> 00:57:57.595]  MREs, as you know, are complete junk filled with MSG to make it taste okay.
[00:57:57.915 --> 00:57:59.736]  You want real stuff, not, not garbage.
[00:58:00.256 --> 00:58:02.037]  You ought to give, uh, him a call.
[00:58:02.077 --> 00:58:03.117]  He sells a lot to police.
[00:58:03.137 --> 00:58:03.197]  1-800-409-5633.
[00:58:06.865 --> 00:58:10.407]  5633 or eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:58:10.447 --> 00:58:13.969]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com, a big fat link to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:16.771]  And I haven't really plugged my videos.
[00:58:16.791 --> 00:58:18.131]  I didn't plug them Thursday or Friday.
[00:58:19.132 --> 00:58:22.314]  And frankly, we don't have any money coming in here, but c'est la vie.

[00:58:58.053 --> 00:58:58.673]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.354 --> 00:59:00.394]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.115 --> 00:59:02.235]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.896 --> 00:59:03.696]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.456 --> 00:59:05.377]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.397 --> 00:59:09.840]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:14.322]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.363 --> 00:59:25.749]  Well, the Edna Lane Brown siege that the media has been going along with the Feds' lies on, saying it doesn't even exist, like Amnesty doesn't exist, Moldenberg Grip doesn't exist,
[00:59:27.009 --> 00:59:31.252]  It's not some hunting trip, boys, to the paramilitary police out there.
[00:59:31.892 --> 00:59:36.055]  This is something that could trigger an armed revolt in this country, which we don't want to happen here.
[00:59:36.475 --> 00:59:38.236]  Jack McClam is coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:38.256 --> 00:59:41.238]  Then we're going to have open phones for the rest of the program.
[00:59:42.099 --> 00:59:47.503]  Also, sometime today, I need to get Mr. Schwab on, who had his son taken because he had a 9-11 sign.
[00:59:48.083 --> 00:59:50.625]  CPS came and grabbed him because they were out exposing 9-11.
[00:59:52.583 --> 00:59:54.224]  That's what's happened to this country.
[00:59:54.284 --> 00:59:57.006]  It's so far gone, I just can't believe it.
[00:59:58.067 --> 01:00:00.268]  Going to Mack Aziz, who's an independent reporter.
[01:00:00.288 --> 01:00:01.529]  He's with 9-11 Truth.
[01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:08.694]  Tell folks about your specific website, and thanks for reporting for us from inside the Brown home.
[01:00:10.035 --> 01:00:10.876]  No problem, Alex.
[01:00:11.336 --> 01:00:16.360]  My website is thetruthmovement.net.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.522]  I came up last night, got here right before dark,
[01:00:21.707 --> 01:00:26.290]  You know, the whole thing about the media calling this place a compound is ridiculous.
[01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:30.733]  This is a beautiful home in some of the most beautiful country I've ever laid eyes on.
[01:00:31.353 --> 01:00:35.976]  And they can try all they want to demonize Ed and Elaine Brown, but it's not going to work.
[01:00:36.617 --> 01:00:40.119]  These are some of the kindest, truest people I have ever met.
[01:00:44.162 --> 01:00:46.423]  When you came in, did you get stopped by anybody?
[01:00:46.443 --> 01:00:47.704]  Did you see any police cars?
[01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:49.085]  Anybody sneaking around in the woods?
[01:00:49.741 --> 01:00:51.784]  Fairly quiet around here, Alex.
[01:00:52.064 --> 01:00:56.009]  I think maybe I saw a Fed following me way back on the way in.
[01:00:56.329 --> 01:01:02.197]  I can't confirm that for sure.
[01:01:02.237 --> 01:01:05.161]  This place is about as secure as a place could be.
[01:01:05.481 --> 01:01:07.243]  They're not going to get in here, that's for sure.
[01:01:08.821 --> 01:01:11.224]  I think that this is a banner year for the truth movement.
[01:01:11.565 --> 01:01:14.108]  I've never seen the past six months unfold like this.
[01:01:14.749 --> 01:01:19.575]  Every single tactic they use backfires on them and that's exactly what this is going to happen.
[01:01:19.595 --> 01:01:20.456]  This is going to backfire.
[01:01:20.516 --> 01:01:23.560]  It's up to us to push this news story to the top.
[01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:24.462]  Right now.
[01:01:24.522 --> 01:01:25.383]  We can't wait around.
[01:01:25.783 --> 01:01:28.867]  And we can't be fearful that people will get desensitized to it.
[01:01:29.007 --> 01:01:30.829]  By the way, I'm glad you mentioned that.
[01:01:30.849 --> 01:01:32.671]  Folks, go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:39.839]  I think we really have the most complete coverage thanks to Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Aaron Dykes, and the rest of the team.
[01:01:40.679 --> 01:01:45.385]  Ryan and everybody that makes it possible, our great IT folks as well.
[01:01:47.206 --> 01:01:50.807]  But at the same time, really, folks, this is serious.
[01:01:50.827 --> 01:01:51.948]  We're trying to avert this.
[01:01:51.988 --> 01:02:02.392]  And if this becomes a big enough story, and enough phone calls get made, enough people are aware, and we can make this a national story, the Feds may do what they did with the Gray family out in East Texas and just back off.
[01:02:02.852 --> 01:02:03.873]  And that's all we want.
[01:02:03.933 --> 01:02:05.673]  We don't want anybody to get killed.
[01:02:06.134 --> 01:02:07.274]  We want this to stop.
[01:02:07.754 --> 01:02:09.055]  And I think the Feds have made a mistake.
[01:02:09.075 --> 01:02:11.936]  They're going in there because they don't want these tax protesters, as they call them,
[01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:15.950]  To be able to, quote, get away with not paying their money into the Federal Reserve.
[01:02:17.231 --> 01:02:19.552]  But all this is going to do is make the Feds look bad in the end.
[01:02:19.852 --> 01:02:20.853]  They cannot win.
[01:02:20.873 --> 01:02:26.457]  The only way they can win, and then we avert civil war, possible civil war, there's a good chance that it could trigger it.
[01:02:27.017 --> 01:02:29.238]  I've really assessed this, and I've been in this movement long enough.
[01:02:29.258 --> 01:02:31.960]  I think I've got the right to, and I think I've earned some bones here.
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.301]  I think I can tell you this is dangerous.
[01:02:33.901 --> 01:02:36.723]  I think I've proven that I'm able to analyze things, is my point.
[01:02:37.427 --> 01:02:43.971]  And this is very dangerous, and it just needs to... I mean, in a sick, cold, calculating way, you know, let them go in and kill the Browns.
[01:02:44.011 --> 01:02:45.872]  Let them, you know, have a sacrificial lamb.
[01:02:46.172 --> 01:02:48.133]  It'll blow up in their face, but I don't want that.
[01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:49.714]  I just want to live in peace.
[01:02:49.754 --> 01:02:50.474]  What do you say, Matt?
[01:02:51.174 --> 01:02:55.777]  I say it's going to blow up in their face way before they get in to even trying to get into this place.
[01:02:55.817 --> 01:02:58.018]  I mean, you've got to look at what's happened this year.
[01:02:58.038 --> 01:02:58.998]  How far we've come.
[01:02:59.519 --> 01:03:00.539]  How much did they lose?
[01:03:00.599 --> 01:03:01.740]  How much did Truth gain?
[01:03:02.586 --> 01:03:05.493]  And the bottom line is we're starting a citizen's watch on this place.
[01:03:05.794 --> 01:03:08.020]  We need to get as many cameras as possible.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.664]  Internet, Ethernet cameras.
[01:03:10.237 --> 01:03:15.999]  They've got a nice spot where if we had a wireless transmitter, we could transmit for 10 miles from this spot.
[01:03:16.499 --> 01:03:22.861]  And we could make sure that we've got, around the clock, 24-7 people watching this as a citizen's watch group.
[01:03:22.881 --> 01:03:28.142]  Now, I'm looking at this, Alex, like I'm an embedded journalist for Genesis Communications Network.
[01:03:28.462 --> 01:03:32.823]  And we need to get more embedded journalists up here, because they're not going to come in here with journalists.
[01:03:34.304 --> 01:03:35.204]  With journalists in here.
[01:03:36.392 --> 01:03:37.813]  Matt Kazee, stay there.
[01:03:38.353 --> 01:03:41.574]  We'll come back and continue with your report and with Jack McClam.
[01:03:42.575 --> 01:03:44.115]  They've cut the power off again.
[01:03:45.916 --> 01:03:48.037]  After their goon threatened them and called them wimps.
[01:03:49.818 --> 01:03:51.919]  And it's just... ugh.
[01:03:56.741 --> 01:03:59.963]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:00.283 --> 01:04:02.205]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.585 --> 01:04:10.230]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.928 --> 01:04:17.992]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.373 --> 01:04:29.800]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.062]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.082 --> 01:04:36.003]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.343 --> 01:04:40.186]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.364]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:04:58.584 --> 01:05:03.027]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[01:05:03.207 --> 01:05:17.218]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey Light Water Purifier, an LED Base, two Berkey Sport Filtration Bottles, the Berkey Battery Adapter, the Berkey MP Solar Charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:05:17.438 --> 01:05:40.469]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications, yet the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[01:05:40.629 --> 01:05:43.271]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:05:46.132 --> 01:05:47.717]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:48.900]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:55.444 --> 01:05:59.586]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:05:59.806 --> 01:06:01.567]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:06:01.828 --> 01:06:08.111]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:06:08.411 --> 01:06:14.534]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:06:14.775 --> 01:06:20.818]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[01:06:21.098 --> 01:06:27.502]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:06:27.662 --> 01:06:31.204]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:06:31.504 --> 01:06:35.207]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:06:35.387 --> 01:06:37.928]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:06:38.068 --> 01:06:39.109]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:39.309 --> 01:06:41.050]  That liner that we've had for nine years now,
[01:07:11.178 --> 01:07:11.878]  Is reality.
[01:07:11.918 --> 01:07:13.319]  We are behind enemy lines.
[01:07:13.359 --> 01:07:14.860]  We are in occupied territory.
[01:07:16.161 --> 01:07:22.284]  Almost every nation on earth, there's only a handful that are not totally occupied, financially and governmentally, by the New World Order.
[01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:34.530]  And they're trying to condition the public through television, radio, and print to accept slavery, to accept handing our children over if they get a stubbed toe to CPS, who's five times more likely to abuse them or kill them, federally, that's federal statistics.
[01:07:35.482 --> 01:07:54.432]  You know, to condition us that mercury is good for our brains, take the shots, to condition us that open borders is good, or that amnesty isn't amnesty, or to condition us that preemptive wars against innocent nations are good, or to convince us that NORAD stood down and people in a cave did all those maneuvers that fighter pilots couldn't even do in the Pentagon.
[01:07:56.093 --> 01:07:57.634]  I mean, this is mind control.
[01:07:57.654 --> 01:08:01.896]  Do you understand they're using basic psychology with more and more sophisticated systems to control us?
[01:08:02.637 --> 01:08:06.759]  Matt Kazee, again, is an independent journalist who's reported for InfoWars.com.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.040]  That's how we met him.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:15.664]  Actually, I've covered his website before, 911TruthSite, but he was there at Virginia Tech, lives on the campus, and got us some incredible reports.
[01:08:16.245 --> 01:08:21.748]  One of his associates got the camera phone video of the police running around and the shots being fired.
[01:08:23.254 --> 01:08:27.237]  But he's there right now, and he's saying this is going to backfire on the New World Order.
[01:08:27.557 --> 01:08:28.237]  Stay there, Matt.
[01:08:28.257 --> 01:08:29.919]  Let's bring in Officer Jack McClam.
[01:08:30.179 --> 01:08:36.103]  For those that just joined us, they sent in a Fed today trying to get him to surrender, saying he was a white supremacist.
[01:08:36.123 --> 01:08:38.584]  The Browns told him, we don't like white supremacists.
[01:08:38.604 --> 01:08:40.766]  And then he said, oh, I'm not a white supremacist, basically.
[01:08:40.826 --> 01:08:42.207]  And then he left.
[01:08:42.867 --> 01:08:46.530]  And I guess that was probably later so they could say that the Browns consorted with white supremacists.
[01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:49.672]  They'll do stuff like that just to demonize them.
[01:08:49.752 --> 01:08:50.692]  And they've done it in the past.
[01:08:50.712 --> 01:08:51.473]  So don't say you don't.
[01:08:52.436 --> 01:08:52.937]  I don't know.
[01:09:05.507 --> 01:09:07.869]  Uh, we're just, you know, people living here trying to live in peace.
[01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:09.931]  And, you know, you're a bunch of bullies.
[01:09:09.971 --> 01:09:11.892]  Then they just hung the phone up and cut the power off.
[01:09:12.453 --> 01:09:22.141]  Jack McClam, who was in the middle of the Ruby Ridge siege, with over 500 militarized police there, they caught video of a helicopter with a bladder full of diesel fuel about to burn the roof off.
[01:09:23.082 --> 01:09:24.102]  Uh, that got stopped.
[01:09:24.623 --> 01:09:26.925]  Then the Feds came out, people that shot the video.
[01:09:27.305 --> 01:09:33.150]  Jack McClam went in with Colonel Bogreitz, a former Special Forces commando, and they got the family out.
[01:09:34.896 --> 01:09:38.899]  Thank God they did, because one of them was about to die from gangrene and had already killed two people and the dog.
[01:09:39.499 --> 01:09:44.023]  Where does this go from now, Jack McClam, hearing the analysis you heard?
[01:09:44.043 --> 01:09:46.805]  Thank God you were listening earlier.
[01:09:47.205 --> 01:09:48.746]  Where is all this going now, Jack?
[01:09:48.766 --> 01:09:50.007]  I mean, what do you see happening?
[01:09:50.187 --> 01:10:00.735]  With your past experience, not just as the most highly decorated police officer and cop of the year twice in Phoenix, but also a Vietnam-era veteran, and being in the middle of Ruby Ridge, I can't think of a better expert
[01:10:01.295 --> 01:10:02.656]  Maybe we should get Bo Grites on.
[01:10:03.216 --> 01:10:06.137]  I guess we could say maybe he knows more than you, but I doubt it.
[01:10:06.217 --> 01:10:11.259]  Jack, I mean, being the top expert really in the world of these sieges, what do we do?
[01:10:11.279 --> 01:10:12.239]  Where do you see this going?
[01:10:12.259 --> 01:10:16.841]  Because it seems the Browns are resigned now to stand until the end like the Alamo.
[01:10:17.221 --> 01:10:22.903]  You can only admire them, but at the same time, as a human being, I don't want them to die, and I don't want a revolution to start.
[01:10:24.372 --> 01:10:25.312]  That's right, brother.
[01:10:26.453 --> 01:10:33.894]  The Feds are showing their frustration right now with sending that undercover agent in on them.
[01:10:34.955 --> 01:10:41.776]  They're trying their best to get to break them and get them out of there because they know if they kill them, they're in deep kimchi.
[01:10:42.056 --> 01:10:48.138]  You know, they're really going to have trouble if they kill this couple with the growth of the freedom movement around the country.
[01:10:48.538 --> 01:10:48.858]  And so,
[01:10:50.071 --> 01:11:00.657]  They're just showing their frustration right now, trying anything they can to get him out of there and to build it for their side, you know, in case they do have to kill him.
[01:11:01.417 --> 01:11:02.698]  Well, they don't have to kill him.
[01:11:02.718 --> 01:11:04.459]  They could back off and just go away.
[01:11:05.419 --> 01:11:15.565]  And on their side, the beauty of their position, if they just back off and go away, if they can't get this couple to come out and go to prison,
[01:11:16.793 --> 01:11:45.115]  Is that they truly believe in their mind within six months we'll be under martial law anyway and Ed and Elaine Brown's fame and people standing up and saying no to the income tax like they did because they got away with it is not going to go anywhere in the minds of this rabble, traitorous people that are running this show because they believe we're all going to be under martial law in six months.
[01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:46.576]  So they're not even thinking about this.
[01:11:48.459 --> 01:11:48.719]  I think?
[01:11:52.526 --> 01:11:55.728]  So, but they don't want to see the freedom movement grow.
[01:11:56.128 --> 01:12:04.333]  And so, they're just, they're going to show their frustration here, because the last thing they want to do is kill this couple and see what happens.
[01:12:05.394 --> 01:12:20.744]  It just reminds me, brother, of the Bible, when they would feed 10 to 50 Christians to the lions, and outside the gate, they'd have 1,000 to 5,000 Christians become Christians, and then when they feed another 50 to the lions, they'd have
[01:12:21.644 --> 01:12:30.739]  Uh, you know, a doubling of the Christians outside the gate, and finally the emperor had to quit feeding the Christians to the lions because they were going to overcome him.
[01:12:31.698 --> 01:12:38.801]  And so the feds don't want to cause this to happen, and so we're going to see some frustration on our part.
[01:12:39.161 --> 01:12:47.864]  Well, Jack, if you and I were cold-blooded and just wanted to see a big civil war and wanted to see a bunch of dead cops, we'd be egging the shine.
[01:12:48.245 --> 01:12:54.187]  But you and I both are really trying to have cooler heads prevail here, and I mean, I know my position why I want that.
[01:12:54.247 --> 01:12:56.588]  Why do you want bad things to not happen, Jack?
[01:12:59.914 --> 01:13:02.797]  I don't like to see the loss of life on either side.
[01:13:02.817 --> 01:13:11.404]  Ed and Elaine are, to me, and I've just gotten to know them here in the last few days better, are tremendous American heroes.
[01:13:11.484 --> 01:13:12.545]  I mean, they're incredible.
[01:13:13.025 --> 01:13:20.671]  They're the same as I saw in the military of a soldier that throws himself on a grenade to save the others around him.
[01:13:20.911 --> 01:13:28.818]  I mean, it's incredible, incredible bravery that they're willing to die to see the freedom movement grow by leaps and bounds.
[01:13:29.582 --> 01:13:30.803]  I mean, that is incredible.
[01:13:30.863 --> 01:13:48.634]  We don't have many people around like it at any lane, and I don't want to see them perish, so I'm praying for them several times a day, and praying for the leaders of this fiasco out there, too, that they'll back off and realize their best positions just to walk off and leave them alone.
[01:13:49.214 --> 01:13:53.597]  Because if they truly believe we're going to be in martial law in six months, it won't matter.
[01:13:54.517 --> 01:13:58.620]  Now, Jack, being in the middle of these situations many times in the past, though,
[01:13:59.565 --> 01:14:02.806]  We know they've got general operating orders from the Justice Department.
[01:14:03.286 --> 01:14:10.707]  Do you think this... I mean, clearly, you've said, I think that Bush is trying, or whoever controls Bush, they're trying to trigger something now.
[01:14:11.107 --> 01:14:12.988]  I do think that's clear here with this.
[01:14:13.028 --> 01:14:17.109]  Plus, they want to make an example of these people, I think because of a disconnect.
[01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:19.669]  You know, some little Enron lawyer up there doesn't know how to run anything.
[01:14:20.269 --> 01:14:22.550]  Alberto Gonzalez, a very foolish,
[01:14:23.811 --> 01:14:27.013]  A lot of arrogance, a lot of chutzpah or bravado, as they say.
[01:14:27.033 --> 01:14:28.994]  A lot of evil.
[01:14:29.214 --> 01:14:30.175]  Exactly, a lot of evil.
[01:14:32.236 --> 01:14:41.483]  How much operational control do you think the Feds in command there, who are obviously low-level individuals, do they even have the wiggle room 2 back off?
[01:14:45.715 --> 01:14:48.656]  Uh, well, no, they're going to follow orders.
[01:14:49.036 --> 01:14:54.899]  You know, the local boys are not going to, you know, the local, uh, ATF and the U.S.
[01:14:54.979 --> 01:14:57.980]  Marshals and FBI are going to follow orders completely.
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.761]  So these decisions are going to come from on high.
[01:15:02.702 --> 01:15:13.446]  It was, uh, I think, uh, I believe a stupid error on the part of the two snipers, you know, the sniper unit out there, uh, to shoot at that man running the dog.
[01:15:14.082 --> 01:15:16.363]  You know, so accidents do happen.
[01:15:17.824 --> 01:15:18.965]  But this is a big one.
[01:15:19.165 --> 01:15:23.907]  They've been given orders to stand down right now until they figure out what to do.
[01:15:24.308 --> 01:15:25.929]  At the highest levels.
[01:15:26.349 --> 01:15:28.930]  This is being run by the highest levels, as you know, Alex.
[01:15:29.050 --> 01:15:30.991]  So right now they're just gathering intelligence.
[01:15:31.652 --> 01:15:31.892]  Right.
[01:15:32.132 --> 01:15:41.077]  And they're coming up with these little games like sending that guy in there to say he's a white supremacist and seeing what kind of reaction they will get.
[01:15:42.914 --> 01:15:45.837]  And trying to resolve this thing anyway, but kill him.
[01:15:46.438 --> 01:15:49.721]  And so our prayers are most important.
[01:15:49.781 --> 01:16:04.115]  But also, Alex, we need to keep calling the county commissioners and tell the sheriff to get over there and get out of his hiding place and go over there and take command of that county that Sullivan County.
[01:16:05.034 --> 01:16:06.155]  We need to call the U.S.
[01:16:06.215 --> 01:16:07.156]  Marshal's Office.
[01:16:07.276 --> 01:16:14.883]  We need to call the President and tell him that we don't want to see any more Waco's or Ruby Ridge's.
[01:16:15.984 --> 01:16:25.033]  We also ought to call the national media and tell them to stop talking about all the bimbo eruptions and get in there and talk about something that's going on.
[01:16:25.606 --> 01:16:31.389]  I'm going to get a comment, I agree, from Matt Kazee on this.
[01:16:31.409 --> 01:16:37.192]  Matt, where do you think this is all going, and do you think it's going to backfire either way on the New World Order?
[01:16:37.899 --> 01:16:38.399]  Absolutely.
[01:16:38.499 --> 01:16:43.020]  One way or the other, it's a lose-lose situation for the Feds in this situation.
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:45.661]  But the bottom line is we want this to turn out peacefully.
[01:16:46.121 --> 01:16:55.584]  Everybody not only needs to call the police and everything and say that they don't want this to happen, they need to call every single radio talk show they can again and again and again and all their friends need to do it.
[01:16:55.904 --> 01:17:00.545]  The other thing that we're doing is we're starting a defense fund that we're going to start a PayPal account.
[01:17:00.605 --> 01:17:03.846]  Now if only 25% of the truth movement would donate $1,
[01:17:05.293 --> 01:17:15.119]  The Browns would have enough money to get a thermal imaging system up here to make sure that they are protected and that the news media can transmit and that we've got the free press in this country.
[01:17:15.179 --> 01:17:20.382]  We want to get a wireless transmitter up here to broadcast because they're going to shut everything down.
[01:17:20.422 --> 01:17:24.584]  They're not going to have their internet and they're going to close it off and this is a very secluded area.
[01:17:24.624 --> 01:17:27.126]  This is one of those places where you're not going to see it happen.
[01:17:27.816 --> 01:17:30.358]  So we need to be able to get up here with internet cameras.
[01:17:30.398 --> 01:17:40.806]  I'm calling out to everybody who has one of these or will buy one of these to buy an Ethernet wireless internet camera or even wired and send it to 2001 Lamar.
[01:17:40.826 --> 01:17:41.946]  Well, hold on.
[01:17:42.006 --> 01:17:45.349]  I'm not going to start being a clearinghouse for a bunch of equipment here at my house.
[01:17:46.089 --> 01:18:05.235]  My address or I mean there my office drop spot it's 3001 by the way Matt I mean obviously if press wants to go there and cover this and set up cameras and things I'm glad you're there I thought you brought cameras in there I did I brought I've got two cameras here I'm going to leave them when I go now here let me give out my address
[01:18:05.983 --> 01:18:06.964]  I don't have anything to hide.
[01:18:07.364 --> 01:18:14.050]  If anybody wants to send something, I'm going to come up next week with whatever I can for the independent free press of this country.
[01:18:14.631 --> 01:18:18.654]  My point is, if I got stuff shipped to me, how would I get it up there?
[01:18:19.381 --> 01:18:21.062]  I'm in Texas there in New Hampshire.
[01:18:21.243 --> 01:18:23.384]  What I'm saying is I haven't heard of this idea.
[01:18:23.424 --> 01:18:25.486]  We're just all saying this on air right now.
[01:18:25.506 --> 01:18:26.287]  So stay there.
[01:18:26.307 --> 01:18:27.367]  We're going to come back to you.
[01:18:27.467 --> 01:18:31.050]  Matt Kazee, who again did a great job, just boom.
[01:18:32.171 --> 01:18:37.235]  I believe I even had him on the show before the Virginia situation for his 9-11 troop group.
[01:18:37.675 --> 01:18:40.678]  And then Matt with Virginia reported just wonderfully for us all.
[01:18:41.398 --> 01:18:48.784]  And then now he's driven up there to cover this for us and we appreciate him being there inside giving us an eyewitness report of what's happening.
[01:18:49.204 --> 01:18:51.486]  And we need to make sure the mainstream media gets out there as well.
[01:18:55.879 --> 01:18:57.840]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.981]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[01:19:01.761 --> 01:19:02.881]  For a while, anyway.
[01:19:03.402 --> 01:19:06.563]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[01:19:07.183 --> 01:19:09.524]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[01:19:09.824 --> 01:19:13.325]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:19:13.685 --> 01:19:15.926]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:19:16.486 --> 01:19:17.206]  What's the name again?
[01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:18.587]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:19:18.967 --> 01:19:19.807]  It's CalX.
[01:19:20.107 --> 01:19:20.327]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:19:22.649 --> 01:19:24.330]  What makes Kallax Ointment so different?
[01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:32.876]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:19:33.897 --> 01:19:38.460]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Kallax Ointment.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:47.786]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:19:48.507 --> 01:19:49.588]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[01:19:49.648 --> 01:19:50.308]  I'll be right back.
[01:19:50.568 --> 01:19:51.509]  I'm getting some Kallax.
[01:19:55.569 --> 01:19:56.730]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:57.150 --> 01:20:02.615]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:03.195 --> 01:20:03.696]  That's right.
[01:20:04.016 --> 01:20:06.678]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:07.699 --> 01:20:13.784]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:14.344 --> 01:20:22.033]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:22.474 --> 01:20:27.340]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.984]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:33.747 --> 01:20:37.889]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:20:38.269 --> 01:20:38.529]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:38.549 --> 01:20:40.470]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:40.850]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:41.410]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.139 --> 01:20:57.321]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:20:57.361 --> 01:21:01.404]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:21:01.524 --> 01:21:04.086]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:21:04.146 --> 01:21:06.487]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:21:06.668 --> 01:21:15.113]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:21:15.193 --> 01:21:16.494]  The brookie light is different.
[01:21:16.634 --> 01:21:20.657]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:21:20.697 --> 01:21:21.137]  We're good to go!
[01:21:41.147 --> 01:21:44.090]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.
[01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:45.751]  888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:21:45.771 --> 01:21:46.692]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:53.723 --> 01:21:56.444]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[01:21:56.884 --> 01:22:02.566]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally, without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[01:22:03.046 --> 01:22:05.207]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[01:22:05.367 --> 01:22:14.570]  These toxins enter our bodies, and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:19.092]  With more than 500 vital functions, give your liver the helping hand it needs
[01:22:19.452 --> 01:22:19.692]  I think so.
[01:22:36.705 --> 01:22:42.292]  To order Live52 and for the best source of researched herbal products, visit research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482.

[01:22:43.294 --> 01:22:44.535]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you!
[01:23:29.853 --> 01:23:30.573]  Welcome back.
[01:23:32.234 --> 01:23:36.595]  I tell you, this thing is quite a soap opera, but it's not fantasy, it's reality.
[01:23:38.615 --> 01:23:43.017]  Some of the things I know behind the scenes that I'm not at liberty to talk about on air because I'm in confidence of people.
[01:23:43.857 --> 01:23:44.857]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:23:44.897 --> 01:23:45.777]  I cannot believe this.
[01:23:45.797 --> 01:23:47.198]  It's like a big game to the feds.
[01:23:50.079 --> 01:23:56.180]  Going back to Matt Kazian, of course, talking to Jack McClam.
[01:23:58.461 --> 01:23:58.741]  Jack,
[01:23:59.972 --> 01:24:01.733]  Do you think that'll help the situation?
[01:24:02.214 --> 01:24:04.075]  I mean, to have alternative media out there?
[01:24:04.115 --> 01:24:06.357]  I mean, I think that it can only help.
[01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:07.898]  Oh, yes.
[01:24:08.418 --> 01:24:10.599]  I think it definitely will help.
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:19.786]  And also, like Matt said, bug the heck out of the talk shows, the Republican propaganda, Fox News.
[01:24:20.683 --> 01:24:32.890]  Talk shows and then the other national media out there and just let them know, the people know that they're tired of hearing about the bimbo eruptions every day and for them to cover real news.
[01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:41.075]  And although they'll call them, you know, everything they say is negative towards the Browns, at least it'll spread.
[01:24:41.535 --> 01:24:42.956]  Anti-government extremists.
[01:24:43.792 --> 01:24:45.653]  Yeah, and they'll say compound.
[01:24:45.694 --> 01:24:47.335]  They live in a compound and everything.
[01:24:47.835 --> 01:24:50.257]  I was watching the news last night.
[01:24:50.337 --> 01:24:55.541]  They have a couple in Texas that they have a big, beautiful church.
[01:24:55.581 --> 01:24:58.383]  They call it a compound because they disagree with them.
[01:24:58.443 --> 01:25:00.325]  And so it just goes on and on.
[01:25:00.745 --> 01:25:06.770]  But the thing is, I think, first of all, we need to call the county commissioner's office.
[01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:09.492]  They have great power over the sheriff.
[01:25:09.672 --> 01:25:13.455]  The county commissioners give him his funds that he doesn't get from the feds.
[01:25:14.295 --> 01:25:15.396]  And we need to call the U.S.
[01:25:15.456 --> 01:25:16.236]  Marshal's Office.
[01:25:16.296 --> 01:25:17.557]  I've got all these numbers.
[01:25:17.757 --> 01:25:18.677]  Call the White House.
[01:25:18.718 --> 01:25:19.598]  I've got that number.
[01:25:19.618 --> 01:25:22.319]  Yeah, give the number to the County Commissioners up.
[01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:24.801]  Okay, County Commissioners is 603, Area Code 863-2560.
[01:25:24.861 --> 01:25:27.362]  Once again, 602, Area Code... 602 or 3?
[01:25:27.402 --> 01:25:28.263]  603, I'm sorry.
[01:25:28.323 --> 01:25:28.263]  603.
[01:25:28.343 --> 01:25:28.423]  Okay.
[01:25:28.443 --> 01:25:29.924]  603, Area Code 863.
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:49.082]  2-5-6-0 and the Sheriff is back now.
[01:25:49.202 --> 01:26:08.331]  He's come out of his hiding place because we called the Sheriff's Department this morning and the person that answered the phone was absolutely frustrated and mean and said the Sheriff has got other important things to do other than concentrate on this plausible window.
[01:26:08.391 --> 01:26:11.473]  I'm sure it's running speed traps to collect money.
[01:26:12.395 --> 01:26:21.281]  But see, the secretary that's answering the phone, that's probably Barbara, is going to tell the sheriff all hell's breaking loose, and that's what you want.
[01:26:21.361 --> 01:26:27.785]  Keep calling the sheriff's office, and his number is 603-863-4200.
[01:26:30.807 --> 01:26:33.448]  Keep calling, just keep calling, bugging the heck out of him.
[01:26:33.468 --> 01:26:35.530]  I think people need to call the New Hampshire governor.
[01:26:36.610 --> 01:26:39.012]  Oh yeah, I've got his number here too, John Lynch.
[01:26:39.795 --> 01:26:49.281]  Governor John Lynch, for sure, call his office, and I've even got his fax number, if they're not answering the phone, which sometimes they do during a standoff like this.
[01:26:49.801 --> 01:26:51.042]  But his number is 603, area code, 271-2121.
[01:26:51.082 --> 01:26:51.842]  And once again, 603-271-2121.
[01:26:51.862 --> 01:26:59.026]  And his fax number, if they're not answering the phone at this time, and I believe that's the case,
[01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:09.671]  It's 603, area code, 271-7680.
[01:27:09.771 --> 01:27:10.211]  Once again, 603-271-7680.
[01:27:10.232 --> 01:27:12.855]  And we just need to let the, you know, we need to go there
[01:27:27.893 --> 01:27:28.834]  Electronically.
[01:27:29.075 --> 01:27:31.278]  In other words, let them know the world's watching.
[01:27:31.418 --> 01:27:33.461]  You know, the nation and the world's watching.
[01:27:33.761 --> 01:27:42.774]  You know, if the feds don't have their heads screwed on straight from past lessons, maybe you ought to find out which FBI agents are in command
[01:27:43.713 --> 01:27:46.274]  And talk to them, Jack.
[01:27:46.294 --> 01:27:48.575]  I mean, they've got to know what this is going to cause.
[01:27:49.196 --> 01:27:58.159]  I mean, is that encouraging to see that Mr. Potok of the Southern Slime Center is having to admit that this is bad for the government, this is bad for the globalists?
[01:27:58.820 --> 01:27:59.280]  Oh, yes.
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:27:59.860]  Yes.
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:01.021]  And it is.
[01:28:01.041 --> 01:28:02.341]  It's terribly bad.
[01:28:02.441 --> 01:28:04.762]  Because they're in a catch-22 now.
[01:28:04.942 --> 01:28:08.264]  If they go in and kill them, man, they're in big trouble.
[01:28:09.065 --> 01:28:15.009]  And they couldn't get the National March on New Hampshire to work so they could claim martial law.
[01:28:15.169 --> 01:28:16.990]  So, now they're in a catch-22.
[01:28:17.050 --> 01:28:21.152]  They don't want to back off because that'll make them look like a bunch of weenies.
[01:28:21.873 --> 01:28:29.917]  But the best thing they could do, speaking militarily, military tactics, is to just back off and leave this couple alone.
[01:28:30.118 --> 01:28:30.498]  Stay there.
[01:28:30.538 --> 01:28:32.259]  Just a few minutes with each of you on the other side.
[01:28:32.279 --> 01:28:35.521]  I want some closing comments from Matt Kazee, as well as Jack McClann.
[01:28:35.541 --> 01:28:37.382]  We're going to get into some other important subjects.
[01:28:43.787 --> 01:28:46.810]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.731 --> 01:28:50.414]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:54.216 --> 01:31:05.221]  JLS Research, the makers of all natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[01:31:05.421 --> 01:31:11.924]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[01:31:12.104 --> 01:31:19.788]  By using organics and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[01:31:19.988 --> 01:31:20.688]  As it responds,
[01:31:20.968 --> 01:31:22.970]  Body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:25.092]  First Responder is the first of its kind.
[01:31:25.192 --> 01:31:26.773]  Comprised of only four organics.
[01:31:27.073 --> 01:31:30.356]  Grape seed skim, grape seed, grapefruit seed, and garlic.
[01:31:30.716 --> 01:31:35.220]  It's so effective you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:38.223]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.
[01:31:38.303 --> 01:31:41.806]  Go online and order First Responder at No-BO.com.
[01:31:42.006 --> 01:31:45.369]  Visit No-BO.com or call JLS Research at 850-723-8599.
[01:31:48.231 --> 01:31:48.491]  That's 850-723-8599.
[01:31:48.511 --> 01:31:49.251]  All of time shall come
[01:32:14.183 --> 01:32:16.685]  We're good to go.
[01:32:50.725 --> 01:32:53.073]  Well, a little bit more of this song.
[01:33:19.491 --> 01:33:32.022]  Romeo and Juliet are together in eternity.
[01:33:32.242 --> 01:33:41.830]  Romeo and Juliet, Romeo and Juliet, Romeo and Juliet, Romeo and Juliet,
[01:33:52.772 --> 01:34:02.521]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:02.602 --> 01:34:03.462]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:34:04.003 --> 01:34:07.806]  It's GCN Radio, and I'm going to let Jack McClam go here in just a moment.
[01:34:07.826 --> 01:34:11.330]  We've got a special guest popping in, and I'm going to have open phones and cover a bunch of news.
[01:34:11.730 --> 01:34:14.533]  The Amnesty End of America bill is not dead yet.
[01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:19.421]  And finish up with Matt Kazee, who I may have popped in at the end of the show again with another report.
[01:34:19.821 --> 01:34:24.002]  Matt, in closing, give out your website and what you're planning to do out there.
[01:34:25.682 --> 01:34:29.602]  The website is thetruthmovement.net.
[01:34:30.823 --> 01:34:40.764]  Another website that you should have is Ed and Elaine Brown's MySpace account, which is myspace.com slash time to make a stand.
[01:34:40.864 --> 01:34:42.705]  And it's the number two.
[01:34:42.805 --> 01:34:44.125]  Time number two.
[01:34:45.533 --> 01:34:46.893]  Um, to make a stand.
[01:34:47.093 --> 01:34:57.576]  And really what people are doing, they're just going to PrisonPlanet.com, as when I asked Ed and them to plug any sites they wanted, they just said Prison Planet, which is in SMART, because we just have links and stories everywhere up there.
[01:34:57.596 --> 01:35:01.577]  You can find it very easy, and I would imagine you're going to post links up on your website too.
[01:35:02.217 --> 01:35:10.459]  Absolutely, and what we're going to do is we're going to start a PayPal account for their defense fund, and I think you're right, what you were saying earlier about sending equipment.
[01:35:10.999 --> 01:35:12.639]  If people would just donate
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:18.181]  Then we can take care of it, and we're going to have buttons for that up on all the websites.
[01:35:18.201 --> 01:35:27.003]  Well, the bigger thing here is, I mean, when you say defense fund, I mean, they're not wanting to, I mean, and they're rightfully saying the government is in the wrong.
[01:35:27.023 --> 01:35:28.624]  It isn't the government, it's a false government.
[01:35:29.124 --> 01:35:39.126]  And so I think the big thing is the media coverage and getting, the biggest donation here is to stop this whole thing, is to call the media, as you were saying earlier, Matt.
[01:35:40.606 --> 01:35:51.370]  The reason for the defense fund is they want a thermal imaging camera or a thermal imaging system so that if in the night, those feds are going to come in here and try to kill them, they're going to know about it.
[01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:53.931]  And that's the whole purpose of that.
[01:35:54.031 --> 01:35:56.092]  And Ed, you know, asked me to say that.
[01:35:58.324 --> 01:35:59.664]  I do think it's going to backfire.
[01:35:59.764 --> 01:36:01.705]  Everybody needs to get on the move right now.
[01:36:01.765 --> 01:36:02.905]  Call everybody they can.
[01:36:03.505 --> 01:36:06.466]  We need to push this story like no other story before.
[01:36:07.006 --> 01:36:07.406]  I agree.
[01:36:07.446 --> 01:36:11.127]  That's why we wrote six or seven articles about it just on Thursday and Friday alone.
[01:36:11.167 --> 01:36:12.027]  Wrote more this weekend.
[01:36:12.327 --> 01:36:13.207]  Thank you, Matt.
[01:36:13.227 --> 01:36:13.807]  We've got your number.
[01:36:13.827 --> 01:36:14.827]  We're going to stay in contact.
[01:36:15.127 --> 01:36:17.588]  Call my office or call me the minute something changes.
[01:36:18.108 --> 01:36:18.368]  All right.
[01:36:18.408 --> 01:36:18.928]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:36:19.288 --> 01:36:19.688]  You bet.
[01:36:20.768 --> 01:36:23.449]  I'm battling here to not give the new order what they want.
[01:36:24.309 --> 01:36:25.350]  And explain my position.
[01:36:25.410 --> 01:36:27.632]  I'm 110% with Ed and Elaine Brown.
[01:36:27.992 --> 01:36:29.373]  I understand their backs against the wall.
[01:36:29.413 --> 01:36:33.116]  I understand they're great heroes with incredible courage.
[01:36:33.136 --> 01:36:34.156]  And they need our prayers.
[01:36:34.176 --> 01:36:36.478]  They need our support with the media to try to defuse this.
[01:36:37.379 --> 01:36:43.063]  And then you've got the FBI that literally works for the private corporations that own this country.
[01:36:43.903 --> 01:36:48.307]  It's the same FBI whose director told you the mob didn't exist, or the New World Order doesn't exist.
[01:36:48.607 --> 01:36:56.914]  It puts out training manuals saying Christians are terrorists, gun owners are terrorists, constitutionalists are terrorists, land rights groups are terrorists.
[01:36:56.974 --> 01:36:58.155]  I mean, everybody's a terrorist now.
[01:36:58.775 --> 01:37:05.401]  No, it's like the high-level FBI agent said in the Associated Press, it was as if Al-Qaeda had moles in the FBI.
[01:37:06.001 --> 01:37:07.222]  Well, yeah, you got it right.
[01:37:07.282 --> 01:37:08.924]  The government has moles in the FBI.
[01:37:09.564 --> 01:37:11.306]  You guys work for a criminal group.
[01:37:11.426 --> 01:37:12.687]  I mean, you just don't know that.
[01:37:13.288 --> 01:37:23.295]  Yeah, and I'm just trying to avert massive disaster here and trying to stop this from turning into some type of flashpoint for a civil war that the New World Order desperately wants.
[01:37:23.355 --> 01:37:23.935]  Jack McClam?
[01:37:25.997 --> 01:37:26.697]  Absolutely.
[01:37:26.777 --> 01:37:28.298]  They want this civil war.
[01:37:28.338 --> 01:37:38.145]  They want this insurrection and they're pushing for it, but so far they haven't got it, praise God, because that's what they want to put us under this
[01:37:39.153 --> 01:37:43.055]  Um, military law system where there will be no more First Amendment.
[01:37:43.135 --> 01:37:45.976]  We can't reach out and touch the hearts and minds of any more people.
[01:37:46.237 --> 01:37:48.938]  Yeah, this is him throwing a fit, trying to turn over the chessboard.
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:50.421]  Yes, yes.
[01:37:50.621 --> 01:38:00.126]  Now, we've just called the Governor's office, and the Governor's office is now telling everybody that calls that we're referring you to the U.S.
[01:38:00.186 --> 01:38:01.026]  Marshal's office.
[01:38:01.066 --> 01:38:12.592]  So, the Governor is now under control of the Feds, but listen, keep calling him because he needs to know how riled up the people are across this nation towards him because most Governors want to be President.
[01:38:13.253 --> 01:38:15.334]  And he'll take that very seriously, this
[01:38:16.517 --> 01:38:19.320]  It's John Lynch here, governor of the state.
[01:38:19.721 --> 01:38:20.342]  Oh yes, absolutely.
[01:38:20.362 --> 01:38:21.022]  And same with Ruby Ridge.
[01:38:21.042 --> 01:38:22.064]  The sheriff was fired.
[01:38:30.612 --> 01:38:32.013]  Other people went down too.
[01:38:32.713 --> 01:38:40.257]  Even though the feds that killed Vicky Weaver got a promotion, the elected officials are scared to death of this thing getting out of hand.
[01:38:40.297 --> 01:38:46.040]  So keep calling the Governor's office and let him know how dissatisfied we are with what he's doing.
[01:38:47.441 --> 01:38:53.204]  Here's the number, 603-271-2121, 603-271-2121.
[01:38:54.285 --> 01:38:57.867]  Jack, you've got the hotline number, you do your own show here on the Network's Weeknight.
[01:38:58.587 --> 01:39:03.229]  Just call me back today with any new developments that happen in the next hour and 20 minutes, okay my friend?
[01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:09.653]  Okay brother, God bless you, thanks a lot, and keep praying folks for Elaine and Ed, I don't need to tell you that.
[01:39:10.213 --> 01:39:11.654]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:39:12.815 --> 01:39:15.656]  And I want listeners all to know, too, this is very serious.
[01:39:15.676 --> 01:39:18.598]  This isn't some macho, shoot-your-mouth-off thing, okay?
[01:39:21.059 --> 01:39:26.601]  This is all extremely serious, and there'll be more and more of this stuff in the future.
[01:39:26.621 --> 01:39:27.542]  There's no doubt of that.
[01:39:28.442 --> 01:39:30.903]  And we do not want to go off half-cocked here.
[01:39:31.103 --> 01:39:36.986]  The Browns have made their decision 18 years ago, and they've made their decision to stand against this tyranny and die if need be.
[01:39:38.026 --> 01:39:39.767]  But it's our job to try to stop that from happening.
[01:39:40.678 --> 01:39:47.824]  And also, I will get no pleasure off of hearing that, because I mean, I know how worthless they are to the New World Order.
[01:39:47.884 --> 01:39:50.687]  I know that they are toilet paper to the New World Order, not to us.
[01:39:51.467 --> 01:39:57.572]  These brainwashed, conditioned husks of former Americans, you know, that would go in and be part of this and do this.
[01:39:57.592 --> 01:39:58.593]  This is their macho way.
[01:39:58.613 --> 01:39:59.334]  This is what they do.
[01:39:59.374 --> 01:39:59.974]  It's exciting.
[01:40:00.235 --> 01:40:01.115]  It's their fun job.
[01:40:02.056 --> 01:40:03.918]  And this is not exciting what you're part of.
[01:40:03.938 --> 01:40:04.518]  This is bad.
[01:40:04.918 --> 01:40:06.300]  You're not going up against bad guys.
[01:40:10.197 --> 01:40:13.840]  This is 50 years ago the Feds couldn't do stuff like this because the police wouldn't do it.
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:17.723]  And 50 years ago the police would go in to a school that had a shooter in it.
[01:40:17.783 --> 01:40:18.383]  Today you don't.
[01:40:18.684 --> 01:40:22.887]  So there's something fundamentally wrong with you and fundamentally wrong with your training.
[01:40:25.129 --> 01:40:26.990]  But it looks like they are backing off.
[01:40:27.531 --> 01:40:29.332]  Though they've cut the power, that's not a good sign.
[01:40:30.353 --> 01:40:35.417]  Let's now go... I wasn't going to have him on last week, but that got cancelled, but I appreciate him coming on today.
[01:40:37.319 --> 01:40:43.221]  When it comes to saving money, that's the way to fight the New World Order, and it's a way to get more control of your life and not be in debt.
[01:40:43.381 --> 01:40:46.082]  Organic made America soaps for 60 years, since 1947.
[01:40:46.903 --> 01:40:51.344]  He got back from World War II and set it up with his daddy, and now he runs it with his son and his son.
[01:40:52.405 --> 01:40:53.685]  Multiple generations here.
[01:40:54.065 --> 01:40:56.987]  Calvin and Pure Soap Company, 5starsoap.com.
[01:40:57.567 --> 01:40:59.448]  That's the address you want to write down and memorize.
[01:40:59.508 --> 01:41:00.548]  It's what I use in my home.
[01:41:01.666 --> 01:41:04.648]  I've had employees that end up getting some of the soap, and they go, you weren't hyping this.
[01:41:04.688 --> 01:41:05.889]  This stuff's really incredible.
[01:41:06.469 --> 01:41:07.490]  Organic soap.
[01:41:07.690 --> 01:41:09.371]  Not detergents, not chemicals.
[01:41:09.791 --> 01:41:13.493]  You know, but the big chemical companies really own Parker & Gamble and the companies you see.
[01:41:14.274 --> 01:41:15.394]  And he's Marty Schachter.
[01:41:15.754 --> 01:41:17.155]  Marty, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:41:17.756 --> 01:41:18.676]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:41:18.716 --> 01:41:19.977]  Thank you for inviting me.
[01:41:19.997 --> 01:41:22.778]  It's always a pleasure talking to you and your listeners.
[01:41:23.359 --> 01:41:25.760]  I've got to tell you about this web I just received.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:30.503]  This is from Arnold Maryland, from an old, long-time listener.
[01:41:31.041 --> 01:41:32.442]  We put on all our orders.
[01:41:32.722 --> 01:41:33.783]  How did you hear about us?
[01:41:34.383 --> 01:41:40.407]  So if we get to know that it's from an Alex Jones Show, they become a priority account.
[01:41:40.787 --> 01:41:44.930]  That is, they get to the head of the line on any shipment first.
[01:41:45.210 --> 01:41:45.791]  Priority.
[01:41:46.331 --> 01:41:47.812]  And he wrote me back.
[01:41:49.013 --> 01:41:50.353]  I asked him, how did you hear about us?
[01:41:50.434 --> 01:41:51.214]  And he wrote me back.
[01:41:51.234 --> 01:41:55.237]  It was an Alex Jones Show that I defound.
[01:41:55.897 --> 01:41:58.619]  That sage young man of world renown.
[01:41:59.451 --> 01:42:05.276]  Who's hearty endorsement gave me hope that I'd be happy with your pure soap.
[01:42:06.877 --> 01:42:09.479]  So he responded to your limericks or your odes.
[01:42:09.959 --> 01:42:11.340]  Right, right.
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:11.921]  With another one.
[01:42:11.961 --> 01:42:12.521]  That's nice.
[01:42:13.082 --> 01:42:14.323]  We are so proud of that.
[01:42:14.363 --> 01:42:19.086]  That is so beautiful to receive that kind of endorsement from a total stranger.
[01:42:19.347 --> 01:42:22.289]  And he put in a very big order for our pure soaps.
[01:42:23.129 --> 01:42:29.033]  Well, I mean you really do say that 85% off supermarket prices and that's a two or three year old number.
[01:42:29.113 --> 01:42:38.158]  Don't you say there's even more now because there's even more shipping added in to all the marketing and shipping that the big companies are doing or is it still 85% off on average?
[01:42:38.758 --> 01:42:51.766]  Well, what they do is that you know between the markups of the distributors, the wholesalers, the dealers, the shipping companies, there's so many middlemen in there that it can't be helped to be high priced
[01:42:52.188 --> 01:42:59.634]  And Al Proctor, Lever, and Colgate are all taking their chemicals and halving it, putting it in half.
[01:42:59.974 --> 01:43:02.075]  They're shortening their bottles to 50%.
[01:43:02.135 --> 01:43:07.680]  They're shortening all their items to say, well, we're going to save on plastic.
[01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:09.321]  We're going to save on paper.
[01:43:09.601 --> 01:43:11.763]  We're going to keep on saving for the consumer.
[01:43:12.143 --> 01:43:14.645]  What they didn't have is the price.
[01:43:15.005 --> 01:43:16.006]  The prices go up.
[01:43:16.386 --> 01:43:17.166]  We're good to go.
[01:43:39.037 --> 01:43:43.861]  And plus, a lot of them, they smelled weird or were really, really, really too strong or burnt my skin.
[01:43:44.381 --> 01:43:47.123]  Not what Marty uses because they've been around for 60 years.
[01:43:47.684 --> 01:43:49.465]  It's going to be 661 soon.
[01:43:49.785 --> 01:43:50.306]  Unbelievable.
[01:43:50.826 --> 01:43:57.631]  Marty, I want to give the number out right now, but then I want to get into what's in the subs.
[01:43:58.412 --> 01:44:00.994]  And that's, uh, well, let me give them the number.
[01:44:02.595 --> 01:44:05.577]  Area code 5, our toll-free number is 800-340-8000.
[01:44:09.306 --> 01:44:09.546]  7-0-9-1.
[01:44:09.566 --> 01:44:10.087]  1-800-800-340-7091.
[01:44:10.107 --> 01:44:19.391]  And the best time to call is now.
[01:44:19.832 --> 01:44:22.313]  Get the free catalog of all our details.
[01:44:22.693 --> 01:44:26.795]  See us on the web at 5starpuresoap.com.
[01:44:27.756 --> 01:44:29.316]  5starsoaps.com.
[01:44:30.137 --> 01:44:31.978]  5starsoaps.com.
[01:44:32.678 --> 01:44:33.959]  That's our website.
[01:44:34.479 --> 01:44:38.361]  And we've got a special today for the listeners of Alex Jones Show.
[01:44:39.002 --> 01:44:40.843]  A one month tote bag.
[01:44:41.404 --> 01:44:44.306]  It'll last the family for between four to eight weeks.
[01:44:44.926 --> 01:44:46.507]  It's got a retail value of $26.
[01:44:46.967 --> 01:44:54.232]  Special $16 for a six pound package of all our pure soaps.
[01:44:54.512 --> 01:44:56.473]  Every one of them in that package.
[01:44:56.894 --> 01:45:00.476]  Plus shipping to your home by United Parcel.
[01:45:00.876 --> 01:45:02.037]  That is a bargain.
[01:45:02.077 --> 01:45:03.418]  It's below our cost.
[01:45:03.954 --> 01:45:04.896]  Oh, we're happy to do it.
[01:45:05.137 --> 01:45:09.365]  We want the people to get back to good old-fashioned pure soaps.
[01:45:09.929 --> 01:45:12.390]  We want everyone to upgrade their lives.
[01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:13.711]  I guarantee it.
[01:45:14.311 --> 01:45:17.472]  I'm taking you out of culture, putting you into first class.
[01:45:17.953 --> 01:45:18.793]  That's what we're doing every day.
[01:45:18.813 --> 01:45:26.216]  Well, the great part is, I mean, A, you're a patriot, 60-year company, family-owned, so it's not one of these multinational, anti-American companies.
[01:45:26.576 --> 01:45:30.118]  Number two, it's an incredible product, and you save 85% off.
[01:45:30.178 --> 01:45:34.440]  And then you're also supporting this radio show, and that's why we have you up at least once a month.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.501]  And Marty, I believe, just
[01:45:37.481 --> 01:45:42.124]  Passionately in what you're doing, and I use your products, and I can't tell people how good they are.
[01:45:42.925 --> 01:45:43.925]  They are just so amazing.
[01:45:43.945 --> 01:45:44.746]  Give that number out again.
[01:45:44.766 --> 01:45:50.269]  800-340-7091.
[01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:52.651]  Or 5starsoap.com.
[01:45:52.911 --> 01:45:57.554]  Got a big fat banner up on InfoWars.com on the left hand side about halfway down.
[01:45:58.214 --> 01:46:02.116]  CalbinPureSoap.com or 5starsoap.com or 1-800-340-7091.
[01:46:04.753 --> 01:46:05.834]  3-4-0-7-0-9-1.
[01:46:09.216 --> 01:46:10.637]  Give him a call, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:10.697 --> 01:46:26.246]  Now, we've just got a few minutes left here, Marty, but specifically, compare what's in a bar of, say, lever soap, or what's the soap that has the Shamrock name that always burns under my arms?
[01:46:26.626 --> 01:46:32.670]  I mean, compare what's in there to the chemical detergent soaps versus a bar of Calvin Pierce soap.
[01:46:33.584 --> 01:46:40.351]  The DevVest have anywhere from 17 to 21 chemicals in there.
[01:46:40.711 --> 01:46:43.774]  It don't take much to read the side panel on the bar.
[01:46:44.154 --> 01:46:47.558]  One of the predominant chemicals is sodium chloride.
[01:46:47.938 --> 01:46:50.460]  And people think, oh my gosh, that's got to be a nuclear!
[01:46:50.701 --> 01:46:52.002]  What is sodium chloride?
[01:46:52.342 --> 01:46:55.065]  Sodium chloride is table salt.
[01:46:56.019 --> 01:47:00.142]  Would you wash your face, your body, your baby with table salt?
[01:47:00.482 --> 01:47:02.403]  Give me a break!
[01:47:02.423 --> 01:47:02.943]  17 chemicals.
[01:47:03.003 --> 01:47:11.309]  The only product that we use in our pure bar soap is coconut oils and vegetable oils of the highest grade.
[01:47:11.789 --> 01:47:18.333]  Two ingredients, a few drops of pure almond oil to give it a little essence, and that's the total.
[01:47:20.446 --> 01:47:21.967]  Totally!
[01:47:22.107 --> 01:47:31.833]  Plus one of your bar soaps in the shower will last, and I've never scientifically done this, but it seems to last like twice as long as other soaps.
[01:47:32.353 --> 01:47:34.435]  Well, it's triple milk.
[01:47:34.455 --> 01:47:36.316]  That means it's compressed real hard.
[01:47:36.776 --> 01:47:44.201]  It won't float, but it'll last three to five times longer than Derib and Zust and Ivory and Irish Spring.
[01:47:44.421 --> 01:47:45.702]  They're all soft bars.
[01:47:46.072 --> 01:47:52.935]  You don't take much to look at your bar of ivory laying on the floor in your shower melting away and dissolving.
[01:47:53.796 --> 01:48:00.719]  Our pure bar of soap in the tub will sink right to the bottom and look up at you and say, USE ME!
[01:48:00.739 --> 01:48:01.620]  USE ME!
[01:48:02.347 --> 01:48:07.331]  It is not a submarine or it just lays there and you pick it up.
[01:48:07.391 --> 01:48:14.376]  And then you've got stuff for the dishwasher, you've got stuff for the clothes washers, you've got stuff, you've also got creams.
[01:48:14.856 --> 01:48:17.938]  And then these are formulas from back in the 40s, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:18.559 --> 01:48:19.639]  So give Marty a call.
[01:48:19.659 --> 01:48:20.580]  Give that number again, Marty.
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:24.083]  800-340-7091 for the four basic soaps.
[01:48:29.059 --> 01:48:32.121]  Bath soap, hair soap, dish soap, and laundry soap.
[01:48:32.301 --> 01:48:33.582]  Now, we're out of time.
[01:48:33.743 --> 01:48:35.464]  Do you have a limerick for me?
[01:48:36.305 --> 01:48:36.545]  Yes.
[01:48:37.325 --> 01:48:40.528]  This is from, this is from merry old England.
[01:48:42.249 --> 01:48:47.713]  There was a young fellow from Crewe, who found a dead mouse in his stew.
[01:48:48.574 --> 01:48:54.018]  Said, the waiter, don't shout and wave it about, or the others will ask for one too.
[01:48:57.450 --> 01:49:06.834]  Oh man, you're, you know my dad would always say that, not always, but a few times a fly would land in my food or be in a restaurant and he'd say, shhh, or everybody will want one.
[01:49:07.314 --> 01:49:12.196]  That must have been some old joke or something from back before my time, but I remember my dad always saying that.
[01:49:13.256 --> 01:49:19.539]  Well Marty, we accidentally missed having you on last month, so we're going to have you on in the next few weeks, and I really appreciate you coming on with us.
[01:49:20.019 --> 01:49:22.260]  Looking forward to it, maybe we could do a little culture.
[01:49:23.381 --> 01:49:26.142]  I know, and in fact you want to do Hamlet on there for us.
[01:49:27.586 --> 01:49:28.606]  I'll do Hamlet for you.
[01:49:28.866 --> 01:49:30.527]  Oh my gosh, folks, don't want to miss that.
[01:49:30.607 --> 01:49:31.207]  Thank you, Marty.
[01:49:31.707 --> 01:49:32.167]  Thank you.
[01:49:32.688 --> 01:49:33.308]  There goes Marty.
[01:49:33.328 --> 01:49:35.689]  Something a little bit lighter for you today with one of our sponsors.
[01:49:35.849 --> 01:49:39.110]  OK, we're going to be right back.
[01:49:39.770 --> 01:49:40.850]  I want to open the phones up.
[01:49:41.210 --> 01:49:44.151]  You want to talk about the immigration bill that's not dead?
[01:49:44.191 --> 01:49:46.172]  What's happening with the Browns?
[01:49:46.212 --> 01:49:47.232]  What's happening with anything?
[01:49:47.252 --> 01:49:47.312]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:47.332 --> 01:49:47.392]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:56.895 --> 01:50:02.342]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.703 --> 01:50:10.333]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.047 --> 01:50:18.089]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.490 --> 01:50:29.933]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.233 --> 01:50:34.155]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.175 --> 01:50:36.115]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.456 --> 01:50:40.237]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:57.539 --> 01:50:58.060]  are located?

[01:51:53.522 --> 01:51:55.243]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:55.463 --> 01:51:59.166]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:59.486 --> 01:52:08.432]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:08.592 --> 01:52:13.495]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.695 --> 01:52:22.641]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[01:52:55.797 --> 01:52:58.338]  I think that a parasitic dream will never come back.
[01:52:58.378 --> 01:53:01.920]  It painted my hands and my face blue.
[01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:07.864]  And suddenly I saw the wind, and I said to myself...
[01:53:13.469 --> 01:53:31.161]  I'd love, like the end of Shawshank Redemption, just to live with my family on some little
[01:53:43.769 --> 01:53:44.450]  Remote beach.
[01:53:45.630 --> 01:53:47.131]  With a few little boats I ran out.
[01:53:47.631 --> 01:53:48.592]  Maybe a little restaurant.
[01:53:49.572 --> 01:53:50.833]  Just live my life like that.
[01:53:52.413 --> 01:53:53.554]  Listen to music like this.
[01:53:56.235 --> 01:53:59.176]  But instead I have to be in the middle of the fight against the New World Order.
[01:54:00.037 --> 01:54:01.317]  But that's our duty as men.
[01:54:01.337 --> 01:54:03.378]  And that's what we're doing.
[01:54:03.418 --> 01:54:11.182]  You know, I've been doing this show for more than 12 years and... The whole time I've heard these people that call in and say, let's start shooting, let's start killing, let's go to war.
[01:54:11.923 --> 01:54:12.543]  You're a wimp!
[01:54:12.583 --> 01:54:14.024]  You won't call for a shootin' wars!
[01:54:14.945 --> 01:54:17.306]  But they're... I never see them runnin' out and shootin' people.
[01:54:17.326 --> 01:54:20.068]  A lot of times they're Feds, folks.
[01:54:20.728 --> 01:54:21.689]  They're provocateurs.
[01:54:21.789 --> 01:54:24.290]  And that's the sickest thing, is we've caught the Feds over and over again.
[01:54:24.731 --> 01:54:27.832]  Creatin' Klan groups, creatin' white supremacist groups, creatin' other groups.
[01:54:29.213 --> 01:54:31.835]  Tryin' to get them to carry out attacks on other Feds.
[01:54:32.475 --> 01:54:33.576]  And I want Feds to know that.
[01:54:33.616 --> 01:54:35.497]  I mean, there's no doubt the FBI murdered
[01:54:36.574 --> 01:54:42.537]  FBI agent, excuse me, police agent, police officer, top of the year, Terrence Yakey.
[01:54:42.557 --> 01:54:43.257]  Tortured him to death.
[01:54:44.137 --> 01:54:45.678]  I've talked to the police that investigated it.
[01:54:46.498 --> 01:54:49.200]  His last phone call was, I got a couple of feds behind me about to pull me over.
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:59.624]  There's no doubt that, I mean, I know a lot of you are hardcore killers, a lot of you are into narcotics and money laundering yourselves, and there's an FBI within the FBI that's actual mafia.
[01:55:00.965 --> 01:55:03.126]  Always has been, going back to before Prohibition.
[01:55:04.987 --> 01:55:05.207]  But,
[01:55:07.677 --> 01:55:10.579]  All the naive police and military folks out there need to know that.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:17.244]  And... It's just so sad to see it all turn into this.
[01:55:17.744 --> 01:55:21.326]  Jim in Texas says he talked to the sheriff up there in New Hampshire.
[01:55:21.346 --> 01:55:24.008]  I'm going to go to Zach, Susan, and others.
[01:55:24.268 --> 01:55:24.909]  Go ahead, Jim.
[01:55:25.469 --> 01:55:26.570]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:55:26.650 --> 01:55:29.652]  Listen, I gave a call up to Newport, New Hampshire.
[01:55:30.233 --> 01:55:33.114]  Actually spoke with Sheriff Michael Prozo.
[01:55:33.215 --> 01:55:34.736]  P-R-O-Z-Z-O.
[01:55:35.737 --> 01:55:36.137]  Yes.
[01:55:36.277 --> 01:55:46.922]  I chastised him for being conveniently out of town and not protecting the citizens of this county, especially Ed and Elaine Brown.
[01:55:47.402 --> 01:55:51.864]  And he said, he gave me some whatever, and then he referred me to the U.S.
[01:55:51.944 --> 01:55:55.546]  Marshal's office and then summarily hung up on me.
[01:55:55.786 --> 01:56:04.410]  Then I called the Governor's office and spoke with two Governor John Lynch's staff members, Laura and John, who were both rude, arrogant,
[01:56:05.029 --> 01:56:05.129]  And
[01:56:25.099 --> 01:56:29.583]  I don't know what to think, but you know, you try to hold people accountable.
[01:56:29.623 --> 01:56:31.144]  They don't want to give the last names.
[01:56:31.164 --> 01:56:41.532]  They don't want to be responsive to your request to protect the citizens of these so-called United States.
[01:56:41.772 --> 01:56:48.958]  And it just upsets me, you know, that these people have gotten and do get away with what they get away with.
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:52.541]  Brother, I agree with you.
[01:56:53.599 --> 01:56:57.041]  And but what these yuppies don't realize is that it's all a facade.
[01:56:57.701 --> 01:56:57.981]  It is.
[01:56:58.241 --> 01:57:03.484]  And that it's all starting to crumble and all these preparations for police state is for them.
[01:57:04.365 --> 01:57:04.885]  Exactly.
[01:57:05.145 --> 01:57:07.446]  When all of this comes down, which it's starting to come down.
[01:57:09.167 --> 01:57:10.188]  I mean, I want to live good.
[01:57:10.248 --> 01:57:11.088]  I want to have a good life.
[01:57:11.168 --> 01:57:12.369]  I wish none of this was happening.
[01:57:13.209 --> 01:57:14.230]  I don't have a death wish.
[01:57:15.150 --> 01:57:16.591]  We're not drawing first blood here.
[01:57:17.011 --> 01:57:18.152]  It's a criminal system.
[01:57:18.632 --> 01:57:19.272]  It is, sir.
[01:57:20.153 --> 01:57:21.934]  I appreciate... God bless you.
[01:57:22.034 --> 01:57:22.394]  Thank you.
[01:57:23.172 --> 01:57:24.553]  Sorry to cut you off there so quickly.
[01:57:24.573 --> 01:57:30.558]  We're going to come back and talk to Zach, Susan, Charlie, Mark, and many others.
[01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:38.164]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:50.841]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.521 --> 01:57:52.582]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.302 --> 01:57:54.403]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.063 --> 01:57:55.884]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.624 --> 01:57:57.525]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.545 --> 01:58:02.148]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.368 --> 01:58:06.511]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.711 --> 01:58:12.575]  President Bush, now returning from Europe in the G8 Summit, where the government, where U.S.
[01:58:12.635 --> 01:58:15.337]  government agents were caught trying to sneak in bombs, as usual.
[01:58:16.117 --> 01:58:17.578]  We'll be covering that later in the hour.
[01:58:18.779 --> 01:58:19.700]  He's on his way back.
[01:58:23.695 --> 01:58:29.257]  To the United States, and he says he's going to go to Capitol Hill and try to ram through the open border program again.
[01:58:30.497 --> 01:58:33.638]  Now make no mistake, we already have amnesty by fiat.
[01:58:33.998 --> 01:58:35.598]  They're above the law, they're left alone.
[01:58:36.018 --> 01:58:39.179]  It's a wink and a nod, 800 plus sanctuary cities.
[01:58:39.619 --> 01:58:43.681]  If a city does say they're going to enforce the law like Farmers Branch, federal judges come in and say no.
[01:58:45.641 --> 01:58:52.243]  Voters try to pass laws saying we're not going to give tuition and pay for births and welfare for illegals, and federal judges say no.
[01:58:53.323 --> 01:58:58.566]  They tell you, sit down and shut up or some men in black uniforms are going to drop by and shove a machine gun down your throat.
[01:58:59.887 --> 01:59:02.429]  And see, the Browns have now said, we're done with all this.
[01:59:02.989 --> 01:59:03.590]  You're crooks.
[01:59:03.670 --> 01:59:04.470]  We're going to stay here.
[01:59:04.570 --> 01:59:05.171]  Come and get us.
[01:59:07.612 --> 01:59:10.774]  And I'm trying to avert this, and I know you want to avert this as well.
[01:59:11.095 --> 01:59:12.355]  We've got open phones this hour.
[01:59:12.375 --> 01:59:14.016]  We're going to get into all the news I just mentioned.
[01:59:14.877 --> 01:59:19.680]  The immigration, the black op averted in Germany.
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:22.322]  But right now, let's go to Jim in Texas.
[01:59:23.490 --> 01:59:24.951]  No, we just talked to Jim in Texas.
[01:59:24.991 --> 01:59:26.091]  So Zach in New York.
[01:59:26.151 --> 01:59:26.831]  Zach, go ahead.
[01:59:27.852 --> 01:59:28.672]  Hello, Alex.
[01:59:28.932 --> 01:59:29.652]  Hi, go ahead.
[01:59:30.333 --> 01:59:34.454]  Well, my name is Zach, and I'm running for mayor of the city of Ithaca here.
[01:59:34.574 --> 01:59:38.596]  And I was going to explain how this town is basically a microcosm of the New World Order.
[01:59:38.736 --> 01:59:39.396]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:59:39.796 --> 01:59:44.018]  We play host to Cornell University, which Paul Wolfowitz was born, raised, went to school here.
[01:59:44.378 --> 01:59:45.118]  And you know about him.
[01:59:45.659 --> 01:59:47.860]  He was a member of one of the senior secret societies.
[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:51.621]  We have Sphinxhead and Quillendagger, which are both
[01:59:52.051 --> 01:59:53.551]  Located within the law building.
[01:59:54.112 --> 01:59:56.972]  One of them has their own tower, towering above the law, literally.
[01:59:58.713 --> 02:00:02.494]  Recently, they had a decision here in town that they were not going to enforce immigration laws.
[02:00:03.654 --> 02:00:07.595]  You know, the police and the mayor decided they will not involve themselves in that.
[02:00:08.335 --> 02:00:11.236]  And also, this is a very big sustainability town.
[02:00:11.296 --> 02:00:20.798]  It's almost... I've told people I don't believe in sustainability, and then I'm running, and they almost spit in my face a couple times, so... I think this is a pretty extraordinary town.
[02:00:21.582 --> 02:00:27.183]  With a lot of potential, but it's really, basically, it's just like everybody else, despite people thinking otherwise.
[02:00:29.444 --> 02:00:32.305]  Well, sustainability is just code word for feudalism.
[02:00:33.065 --> 02:00:38.486]  I know, it's about controlling people's property and so on and so forth, but that's kind of hard to explain to somebody who isn't, you know.
[02:00:39.706 --> 02:00:42.687]  It's liberalism as a syndrome, I guess, is what we have going on here.
[02:00:43.266 --> 02:00:44.788]  Well, they call it liberalism.
[02:00:45.089 --> 02:00:46.831]  I mean, that gives it some type of defense.
[02:00:46.911 --> 02:00:47.252]  It's not.
[02:00:47.292 --> 02:00:54.121]  It's just cold, hard corporations are changing policies that take your private property, and they claim it's for the environment, which is the new religion.
[02:00:55.302 --> 02:00:59.268]  And again, as well as that, Cornell University pays no land taxes.
[02:00:59.941 --> 02:01:07.505]  So, while 75% of the people in this town rent, there's about 11,000 acres of the town that is untaxed because of Cornell.
[02:01:07.886 --> 02:01:13.449]  And they like to play, you know, like the innocent... Hey, I can barely pay my property taxes and they just go up and up.
[02:01:13.509 --> 02:01:14.969]  I don't know how anybody's going to live here.
[02:01:16.010 --> 02:01:20.152]  Well, my grandmother's house was just reassessed last year, an additional $80,000.
[02:01:20.453 --> 02:01:23.114]  She works nearly full-time at the shopping mall.
[02:01:23.436 --> 02:01:24.836]  Just to break even on our taxes.
[02:01:25.316 --> 02:01:31.038]  People are making it by, but I'm doing the best I can to... They're going to charge your grandmother $80,000.
[02:01:31.798 --> 02:01:32.938]  No, no.
[02:01:32.958 --> 02:01:35.298]  They increased the assessed value of the house $80,000.
[02:01:35.979 --> 02:01:39.719]  I know people with small three bedroom houses that are paying $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 in property taxes.
[02:01:39.779 --> 02:01:41.020]  It's just out of control.
[02:01:48.419 --> 02:01:54.427]  Well, exactly, and that's why I'm trying to get... And see, you can't sell that house and get something comparable to live in.
[02:01:55.548 --> 02:01:56.650]  I mean, it's just they're making it.
[02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:58.512]  It's all designed to consolidate the wealth.
[02:01:58.552 --> 02:01:59.173]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:59.433 --> 02:01:59.634]  Thank you.
[02:02:00.635 --> 02:02:03.639]  When we get back, we'll go to Susan, Charlie, Mark,
[02:02:04.472 --> 02:02:06.254]  John, Tom, many others that are holding.
[02:02:06.554 --> 02:02:08.236]  The total free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:08.276 --> 02:02:15.183]  And that was a great caller, but I'm going to... I always say this and rarely do it, but I'm really doing it today.
[02:02:15.523 --> 02:02:18.146]  We're just going to go bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam to your calls.
[02:02:18.166 --> 02:02:22.030]  Because I want to get into the false flag terror attack that looks like was averted.
[02:02:22.774 --> 02:02:24.936]  I want to get into the amnesty plan being back.
[02:02:25.536 --> 02:02:29.999]  It's a military psych-op tactic to keep claiming that they're not trying to pass it.
[02:02:30.019 --> 02:02:32.881]  Of course, just two weeks ago they were denying it existed.
[02:02:33.521 --> 02:02:38.825]  I mean, it shows me they're making their move now because the lying, if it was possible, has quadrupled.
[02:02:38.965 --> 02:02:43.007]  I mean, it's just wall-to-wall lying out of every government agency you can imagine.
[02:02:43.047 --> 02:02:45.209]  Because they're not government agencies, they're enemies of America.
[02:02:48.914 --> 02:02:52.096]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.436 --> 02:02:54.338]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.738 --> 02:03:02.363]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:03.081 --> 02:03:10.143]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.524 --> 02:03:21.927]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House probe to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.247 --> 02:03:25.809]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.209 --> 02:03:28.109]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:32.331]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:48.663]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:03:48.983 --> 02:03:53.907]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:03:54.167 --> 02:03:58.530]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:03:58.811 --> 02:04:07.738]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:04:07.938 --> 02:04:11.561]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:04:11.841 --> 02:04:16.889]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:04:17.169 --> 02:04:23.879]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:04:24.375 --> 02:04:25.036]  What about you?
[02:04:25.676 --> 02:04:31.041]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:04:45.436 --> 02:04:49.737]  If you've ever wanted to grow the absolute best tasting fruits and vegetables imaginable, here's some exciting news.
[02:04:49.937 --> 02:04:52.638]  There's a new product designed to make growing delicious produce easy.
[02:04:52.798 --> 02:04:55.219]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's dynamite in the garden.
[02:04:55.439 --> 02:05:02.261]  Proto-Gro is a bioactive superfood for plants that works by providing true broad spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their full genetic expression.
[02:05:02.461 --> 02:05:03.581]  What does this mean in the garden?
[02:05:03.661 --> 02:05:14.965]  It needs mouth-watering fruits and vegetables, brilliantly colored flowers, herbs that finally grow to medicinal strength, blue-ribbon garden produce jam-packed with bioavailable minerals and trace elements, giant pumpkins, even high-potency, high-bricks wheatgrass.
[02:05:15.045 --> 02:05:18.086]  Proto-Gro is a proprietary blend of full-spectrum nutrients from the sea.
[02:05:18.246 --> 02:05:20.827]  It literally contains the basic building blocks of life itself.
[02:05:21.047 --> 02:05:28.049]  In fact, Proto-Gro is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record time that it almost forces plants to grow even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[02:05:28.329 --> 02:05:30.930]  It's also perfect for growing your own survival foods and mice.
[02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:32.991]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:33.011 --> 02:05:34.492]  Major German newspapers reported Shatterdee.
[02:05:34.512 --> 02:05:36.834]  We had a report up by Shatterdee up on prisonplanet.com.
[02:05:59.634 --> 02:06:00.515]  That, quote, U.S.
[02:06:00.575 --> 02:06:05.117]  government agents were caught trying to sneak in plastic explosives during the G8.
[02:06:05.457 --> 02:06:07.298]  Now, they've been caught in the past doing this.
[02:06:07.978 --> 02:06:10.139]  This was a false flag clearly being averted.
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:17.543]  You dovetail that with the headline that Shin Bet was involved in the 1976 hijacking.
[02:06:18.084 --> 02:06:22.546]  Admissions now by the former head of German intelligence that they staged terror attacks with the Arabs.
[02:06:23.947 --> 02:06:25.527]  I mean, this is just all off the charts.
[02:06:25.567 --> 02:06:28.569]  And that's in one day in September, which is an Academy Award winning documentary.
[02:06:29.241 --> 02:06:32.345]  I mean, just so many examples hidden in plain view of government-sponsored terror.
[02:06:32.366 --> 02:06:35.169]  We'll talk about this new one, and we're about to go right back to your calls.
[02:06:36.331 --> 02:06:38.975]  But first off, solutions from science in Thomas, Illinois.
[02:06:39.890 --> 02:06:41.991]  Made this offer as easy to swallow as possible.
[02:06:42.471 --> 02:06:51.595]  So, I have asked Solutions from Science to send you a three-month supply of their product called Shilocene and open a special line of credit for my listeners so they don't have to pay up front.
[02:06:52.075 --> 02:06:53.976]  It's pretty easy to have some sent to you.
[02:06:54.256 --> 02:06:56.497]  Just go to their website and get some.
[02:06:56.557 --> 02:06:58.218]  And of course, don't pay anything right now.
[02:06:58.258 --> 02:06:59.739]  In fact, don't give them your credit card number.
[02:06:59.759 --> 02:07:01.079]  It's just an invoice.
[02:07:01.159 --> 02:07:02.780]  And if you want to pay it in three months, you pay it.
[02:07:03.340 --> 02:07:04.941]  It's blacklistedherb.com.
[02:07:04.961 --> 02:07:07.182]  That's just one of the hundreds of products they have as a Shilocene.
[02:07:08.166 --> 02:07:09.326]  I've got a bottle of it right here.
[02:07:09.366 --> 02:07:13.868]  It's got this mountain mineral extract.
[02:07:13.968 --> 02:07:17.069]  It's a mineral deposit called Shilajit.
[02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:20.090]  But their proprietary blend is called Shilazine.
[02:07:20.110 --> 02:07:21.051]  It's mixed with some other stuff.
[02:07:21.811 --> 02:07:23.032]  And I checked into it.
[02:07:23.112 --> 02:07:23.952]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:07:25.130 --> 02:07:27.871]  Here's what they mean by that, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:28.271 --> 02:07:31.612]  Solutions from Science won't even let you pay with a credit card if you don't want to.
[02:07:31.952 --> 02:07:34.072]  They don't want to run up your credit card bill.
[02:07:34.452 --> 02:07:43.654]  No, they just offered to send my listeners a 90-day supply of Shiloxine with just an invoice to pay later if you find that it's everything we've said it is.
[02:07:43.674 --> 02:07:45.615]  877-327-0365 is the number.
[02:07:45.635 --> 02:07:45.695]  877-327-0365.
[02:07:45.795 --> 02:07:46.155]  Try it.
[02:07:55.092 --> 02:07:57.694]  And if you feel like paying for it, go ahead, and I think you will.
[02:07:57.714 --> 02:08:03.157]  877-327-0365 or Blacklistedherbs.com.
[02:08:03.297 --> 02:08:04.978]  Blacklistedherb.com.
[02:08:05.038 --> 02:08:06.439]  It is a singular, not a plural.
[02:08:06.459 --> 02:08:07.560]  I keep putting an S on it.
[02:08:08.781 --> 02:08:11.422]  Another great company we have is ResearchedHerbs.com.
[02:08:11.562 --> 02:08:14.264]  One of the oldest and most established companies in the country.
[02:08:14.464 --> 02:08:16.445]  These are the mainline Researched Herbs.
[02:08:17.126 --> 02:08:18.827]  High quality extracts of them.
[02:08:19.831 --> 02:08:20.252]  I think so.
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:41.703]  Just so many different types of detoxes and you name it.
[02:08:41.743 --> 02:08:43.245]  Just go read all the information for yourself.
[02:08:43.565 --> 02:08:51.512]  ResearchHerbs.com or 1-800-845-3841 and check out all the other great products at ResearchHerbs.com.
[02:08:51.973 --> 02:08:54.876]  Right now, let's now go back to the calls.
[02:08:55.236 --> 02:08:56.898]  Let's talk to Susan in Tennessee.
[02:08:56.998 --> 02:08:57.979]  Susan, you're on the air.
[02:08:58.039 --> 02:08:58.339]  Welcome.
[02:08:59.352 --> 02:09:00.112]  Yes, hi Alex.
[02:09:00.452 --> 02:09:10.716]  I'm calling just to remind Governor Lynch and Sheriff Pozo that if they think that they can keep this local, keep it quiet, and just hide out or not answer phone calls, they're mistaken.
[02:09:10.797 --> 02:09:16.919]  Because people all over this country are waking up to what's happening out there and realizing that it applies to all of us.
[02:09:18.185 --> 02:09:19.626]  It does apply to all of us.
[02:09:19.706 --> 02:09:20.886]  I mean, it comes down to this.
[02:09:20.906 --> 02:09:27.548]  They're given the illegal aliens five years amnesty on not having to pay back taxes if they had jobs and lied about it.
[02:09:27.748 --> 02:09:28.748]  That's in the subsection.
[02:09:28.768 --> 02:09:29.548]  I read it last week.
[02:09:29.828 --> 02:09:33.929]  But then, citizens with no criminal record have to die.
[02:09:33.949 --> 02:09:36.570]  That's right, and it's despicable.
[02:09:37.530 --> 02:09:41.471]  I hope that they realize that they have the jurisdiction.
[02:09:41.612 --> 02:09:47.013]  They can and they should uphold the Constitution that they have took an oath to do for their citizens.
[02:09:47.418 --> 02:09:49.640]  Protect the Eds, Ed and Elaine Brown.
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:51.181]  That's all I have for you.
[02:09:51.201 --> 02:09:51.541]  Thank you.
[02:09:52.042 --> 02:09:54.163]  Thank you, and I'm going to try to get Bo Grites on.
[02:09:54.183 --> 02:10:10.556]  You know, we've had our disagreements about things in the past, mainly when Bo attacked me one time on there for a reason, and I probably overreacted to what he said, but to make a long story short, Bo was there at the Ruby Ridge siege, and he's an expert on these type of things.
[02:10:10.576 --> 02:10:11.697]  I'm going to try to get him on.
[02:10:11.717 --> 02:10:13.558]  I don't think I have his number anymore.
[02:10:13.578 --> 02:10:15.459]  I think it's an old number I have, and then I also want to get
[02:10:16.630 --> 02:10:17.430]  Joe Bannister on.
[02:10:17.470 --> 02:10:18.351]  Joseph Bannister.
[02:10:18.691 --> 02:10:19.772]  No criminal record.
[02:10:19.892 --> 02:10:20.932]  Treasury agent.
[02:10:21.372 --> 02:10:22.853]  You know, doing the armed IRS raids.
[02:10:22.893 --> 02:10:27.976]  He heard a radio talk show in 1997 out in San Francisco where he lived.
[02:10:28.656 --> 02:10:30.217]  I was the first person to interview him, by the way.
[02:10:30.237 --> 02:10:31.177]  It was an incredible interview.
[02:10:31.277 --> 02:10:32.738]  First radio and TV interview.
[02:10:33.699 --> 02:10:37.561]  Even before it was published in Media Bypass, Pat Shannon called me and said, you ought to interview this guy.
[02:10:38.141 --> 02:10:39.061]  So he gave me that scoop.
[02:10:39.081 --> 02:10:39.742]  I appreciate that.
[02:10:39.762 --> 02:10:40.462]  But that doesn't matter.
[02:10:41.082 --> 02:10:46.245]  The interviews in my film, Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Exposed, that's just 15 minutes of the two-hour film.
[02:10:48.035 --> 02:10:55.863]  And I went out and interviewed him and he said, listen, I'm making $100,000 a year.
[02:10:55.883 --> 02:11:01.869]  It was like $90,000 at the time and I'm doing great and I don't want to lose this job.
[02:11:01.909 --> 02:11:04.232]  He has a big house and kids and everything else.
[02:11:04.252 --> 02:11:06.995]  But he said, I heard the show and I was going to prove him wrong.
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:12.701]  You know, I was going to try to get people to go after these people for lying and putting out, you know, stuff to get people in trouble.
[02:11:13.221 --> 02:11:22.043]  And for two years I studied it and I took it to my superiors and they said, look, we're not going to respond to this, we're not going to show you a law, and just keep your mouth shut about this.
[02:11:23.143 --> 02:11:25.004]  And they said, go ahead and resign.
[02:11:25.504 --> 02:11:27.344]  Because he said, if you can't show me this, I'm going to resign.
[02:11:27.364 --> 02:11:30.345]  And they said, here's a letter for you to sign, then go ahead and resign.
[02:11:30.385 --> 02:11:31.245]  Tender your resignation.
[02:11:32.345 --> 02:11:36.066]  Then he went out and spoke about it, and they indicted him on trumped-up charges of
[02:11:37.222 --> 02:11:39.706]  You know, giving bad CPA advice basically is what it boiled down to.
[02:11:39.726 --> 02:11:40.668]  I forget the exact charge.
[02:11:41.449 --> 02:11:43.753]  And, uh, he was found not guilty by a jury of his peers.
[02:11:46.492 --> 02:11:47.953]  I mean, this stuff's real, folks.
[02:11:48.013 --> 02:11:52.397]  I mean, I could see it in 10 years, I'll be on air going, Centro's a private company.
[02:11:52.957 --> 02:11:55.839]  They took over existing roads in Texas, 8,000 miles.
[02:11:55.859 --> 02:11:57.741]  They're taxing you $200-plus billion profit.
[02:11:57.761 --> 02:11:59.922]  They said they're going to make it in the first 10 years.
[02:12:00.523 --> 02:12:02.324]  The legislature admits it's criminal.
[02:12:02.564 --> 02:12:03.565]  I'll have old documents.
[02:12:03.605 --> 02:12:06.927]  People go, ha ha, everybody knows the roads of the government.
[02:12:06.947 --> 02:12:08.889]  Everybody knows you have to pay.
[02:12:10.090 --> 02:12:14.493]  See, and they just set the precedent and then just operate according to possession.
[02:12:15.831 --> 02:12:16.991]  Which is nine-tenths of the law.
[02:12:17.011 --> 02:12:24.713]  I mean, if they can run their flag up and basically like a dog hiking its leg on us and do it, and they got guys with guns that will come and force it, it is the law.
[02:12:26.794 --> 02:12:35.476]  Just like it was the law that blacks were two-thirds human, and it was the law that you could put a chain around their neck and have them pull your plow and treat them worse than you can treat a donkey.
[02:12:36.137 --> 02:12:40.738]  Now, they were still human beings in natural law and God's law, but the law did say they were animals.
[02:12:41.801 --> 02:12:45.942]  And then they do have regulatory laws that say we've got to pay the private banks.
[02:12:46.842 --> 02:12:47.842]  But it is a fraud.
[02:12:49.863 --> 02:12:51.803]  And so that's where this confusion comes in.
[02:12:51.863 --> 02:12:55.204]  I mean, I remember learning about this 15 years ago and thinking, that isn't true.
[02:12:55.244 --> 02:12:58.324]  The IRS's government with its weird satanic symbol.
[02:12:58.384 --> 02:13:00.085]  I mean, you know what the IRS's symbol is.
[02:13:00.805 --> 02:13:02.785]  Go look at that in hieroglyphs.
[02:13:05.086 --> 02:13:06.306]  Go look at it in hieroglyphs.
[02:13:06.386 --> 02:13:08.706]  I mean, it's the Egyptian god of death.
[02:13:08.726 --> 02:13:11.247]  I mean, these people don't play games, folks.
[02:13:12.529 --> 02:13:15.312]  Egyptian God of Death with a scales in its hand.
[02:13:17.433 --> 02:13:18.474]  We're in so much trouble.
[02:13:18.514 --> 02:13:20.136]  I mean, it's the actual hieroglyph.
[02:13:22.898 --> 02:13:25.540]  I just can't believe how far all this has gone.
[02:13:29.844 --> 02:13:34.368]  The sickest thing is that the real estate bubble is popping.
[02:13:36.638 --> 02:13:46.567]  In many areas of the country, and we are in free fall, and the dollar has been devalued, and I look at these competitive, mean-eyed yuppies, I saw a couple yesterday.
[02:13:47.948 --> 02:13:48.929]  You know the people I'm talking about.
[02:13:48.949 --> 02:13:51.331]  I just feel so sorry for them, because they have no idea.
[02:13:51.991 --> 02:13:53.212]  They have been so set up.
[02:13:54.854 --> 02:13:58.437]  This won't be like the real estate crash in the late 80's or the depression in the 30's.
[02:13:58.497 --> 02:14:00.379]  I mean, this is all by design.
[02:14:00.399 --> 02:14:01.800]  They're just setting everything up.
[02:14:03.826 --> 02:14:15.409]  I know a lot of FBI guys know all this, and their view is, well, at least I'll be in the catbird seat when all this goes down, and, you know, at least I'll still have my job, and at least I'll be taken care of.
[02:14:16.609 --> 02:14:22.911]  And the truth is, if the globalists get the signals that you guys and gals aren't going to follow through on this criminal stuff, they'll back off.
[02:14:23.751 --> 02:14:26.812]  But very bad things are going to happen if they think you're going to go through with all this.
[02:14:26.872 --> 02:14:29.653]  And I just want to try to talk you out of what you're doing.
[02:14:30.793 --> 02:14:34.001]  I mean, you're trying to always use your propaganda to sell us on what you're doing.
[02:14:34.021 --> 02:14:35.224]  Then get off our backs, man!
[02:14:35.626 --> 02:14:37.310]  How do you think we're going to sit here and take this?
[02:14:39.617 --> 02:14:43.058]  You push, and you push, and you push, and you push, and you push, and you push.
[02:14:43.498 --> 02:14:49.339]  You burn down churches in front of us, and you shoot women in the head in front of us, and cops taser people to death, and laugh about it.
[02:14:49.359 --> 02:14:51.219]  You shoot black men in the back, and then laugh about it.
[02:14:51.239 --> 02:14:53.659]  That video's all over the news here in Austin.
[02:14:53.699 --> 02:15:00.380]  And you do all these things to us, and cops waddle over to me last Thursday and say, you need to leave or we're going to arrest everybody.
[02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:03.381]  And then they go tell the media we're liars, and they didn't say that.
[02:15:04.481 --> 02:15:06.802]  And you're right, I started yelling at you and got mad at you.
[02:15:07.082 --> 02:15:09.362]  You think it's just normal to try to violate my First Amendment?
[02:15:10.106 --> 02:15:11.327]  You know how dangerous that is?
[02:15:11.407 --> 02:15:12.087]  I know history.
[02:15:13.207 --> 02:15:14.268]  What's it going to be next?
[02:15:15.268 --> 02:15:15.509]  See?
[02:15:16.029 --> 02:15:18.470]  You take one and you take it all and you have taken it all.
[02:15:19.911 --> 02:15:29.335]  If I didn't have such a personality and wasn't so aggressive and didn't literally law the jungle, you had your paddy wagons ready, you said you were going to arrest us all, we got that on tape when you're all meeting, you were going to come arrest us.
[02:15:29.375 --> 02:15:36.558]  But I literally sat there and threatened you with lawsuits, which you knew I'm in it, in your gut, so you backed off.
[02:15:36.679 --> 02:15:37.359]  Good for you!
[02:15:39.409 --> 02:15:40.890]  I can't let you run over me.
[02:15:41.090 --> 02:15:42.812]  I can't let you do this to my country.
[02:15:43.152 --> 02:15:44.032]  My children live here.
[02:15:44.193 --> 02:15:45.914]  I plan to have my grandchildren grow up here.
[02:15:46.774 --> 02:15:47.215]  You understand?
[02:15:47.255 --> 02:15:48.255]  I've committed to this.
[02:15:49.596 --> 02:15:51.778]  I'm not the one hitting you in the face.
[02:15:51.878 --> 02:15:53.079]  I'm not the one threatening you.
[02:15:53.339 --> 02:15:57.502]  I'm not the one trying to violate the precious rights that are the bedrock of America.
[02:15:58.623 --> 02:15:59.704]  We're not the bad guys.
[02:15:59.784 --> 02:16:00.224]  You are.
[02:16:01.576 --> 02:16:06.442]  And I'm so polite and nice, like I always am to police, until they do something evil.
[02:16:06.482 --> 02:16:07.803]  And man, then I come unglued!
[02:16:08.144 --> 02:16:09.906]  I'm sick of your BS!
[02:16:13.230 --> 02:16:19.257]  And ten years ago I hated you, just flat out hated you and thought you were pathetic and on power trips and a bunch of thugs, but now I just feel sorry for you.
[02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:34.191]  Because this stuff, look, they give the same vaccines to your children, you drink the same aspartame foods, you drink the same sodium fluoride, you do all the same stuff, and look, it's not my opinion.
[02:16:35.558 --> 02:16:38.619]  Diabetes is up 3,000% from 25 years ago.
[02:16:38.759 --> 02:16:41.820]  Autism is up tens of thousands of percentiles.
[02:16:42.580 --> 02:16:43.661]  Everything's falling apart.
[02:16:43.721 --> 02:16:44.721]  Cancer is way up.
[02:16:45.021 --> 02:16:46.381]  The sperm count's way down.
[02:16:46.922 --> 02:16:48.982]  Genetic engineering is a serious crisis.
[02:16:49.002 --> 02:16:50.683]  People email me thinking I'm afraid of technology.
[02:16:51.003 --> 02:16:52.043]  I've done the studying.
[02:16:52.163 --> 02:16:53.744]  I know what real environmental threats are.
[02:16:54.004 --> 02:16:56.705]  Meanwhile, they've got a new environmental religion they've shut up.
[02:16:56.785 --> 02:16:58.105]  World government's being shut up.
[02:17:03.052 --> 02:17:08.373]  They're setting up feudalism and they're going to tax you off your, literally, your carbon footprint.
[02:17:08.673 --> 02:17:09.854]  That is a breathing tax.
[02:17:09.894 --> 02:17:10.614]  That's what this is.
[02:17:11.894 --> 02:17:13.314]  Even the mainstream news has said that.
[02:17:13.794 --> 02:17:15.055]  And you can't see what's happening.
[02:17:16.555 --> 02:17:18.676]  They want to control energy and resources.
[02:17:19.036 --> 02:17:20.076]  It's called feudalism.
[02:17:20.796 --> 02:17:24.377]  These are cold-blooded killers that run things.
[02:17:25.957 --> 02:17:29.718]  And I just still think there's some humanity left in people that work in the system.
[02:17:30.598 --> 02:17:33.285]  I mean, you better... Look, I don't expect you to believe me.
[02:17:33.826 --> 02:17:35.851]  But I do demand you check out my claims.
[02:17:36.252 --> 02:17:37.234]  Like Joe Bannister did.
[02:17:38.296 --> 02:17:40.642]  And you're gonna find out some very serious things have happened.
[02:17:45.891 --> 02:17:51.173]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[02:17:51.393 --> 02:17:53.453]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[02:17:53.713 --> 02:18:00.815]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:18:00.956 --> 02:18:12.459]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[02:18:12.859 --> 02:18:20.264]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[02:18:20.524 --> 02:18:25.528]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[02:18:25.648 --> 02:18:30.651]  Disconnect your application, the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[02:18:30.951 --> 02:18:36.255]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:48.902]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:49.302 --> 02:18:54.785]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:55.365 --> 02:18:55.866]  That's right.
[02:18:56.166 --> 02:18:58.467]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:59.868 --> 02:19:05.951]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:06.491 --> 02:19:14.200]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:14.641 --> 02:19:19.447]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:20.103 --> 02:19:25.128]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:25.929 --> 02:19:30.073]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:30.434 --> 02:19:30.674]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.694 --> 02:19:32.636]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:32.716 --> 02:19:33.016]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:33.317 --> 02:19:33.577]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:46.519 --> 02:19:48.260]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:49.721]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:52.703]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:19:53.083 --> 02:19:55.845]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:19:56.385 --> 02:20:03.090]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:20:46.414 --> 02:20:54.380]  Attention women over 40, if you want to look as much as 20 years younger in less than one minute, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:55.161]  Here's why.
[02:20:55.301 --> 02:20:59.584]  There's a brand new cosmetic product that makes wrinkles almost invisible to the naked eye.
[02:20:59.724 --> 02:21:04.888]  In fact, the new product allows some women to look so young so fast that it makes them feel like they're cheating.
[02:21:05.149 --> 02:21:06.910]  They are in a way, but it works.
[02:21:07.210 --> 02:21:10.813]  By the way, it's also a jealously guarded secret used by professional models.
[02:21:11.013 --> 02:21:15.995]  You see, these women often have to look much younger than they really are or else they lose their jobs.
[02:21:16.175 --> 02:21:23.358]  The product uses something like a magician's trick to actually de-age the appearance of human skin and it's now available to listeners of this station.
[02:21:23.538 --> 02:21:27.900]  Want to take years off your appearance and don't want cosmetic surgery or painful injections?
[02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:33.002]  There is now a very real chance you can do it with this new cream called simply Magician's Formula 987.
[02:21:33.062 --> 02:21:34.263]  Just go to 987magic.com.
[02:21:34.283 --> 02:21:34.663]  That's 987magic.com.
[02:21:38.084 --> 02:21:38.484]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:21:38.504 --> 02:21:38.705]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:21:38.745 --> 02:21:39.645]  Get up, stand up.
[02:21:39.685 --> 02:21:40.786]  Stand up for your right.
[02:21:41.006 --> 02:21:41.527]  Get up, stand up.
[02:22:07.272 --> 02:22:08.892]  Welcome back, let's go straight to your calls.
[02:22:09.072 --> 02:22:12.394]  Charlie in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[02:22:12.954 --> 02:22:14.134]  Hey Alex, how's it going, man?
[02:22:14.294 --> 02:22:14.674]  Good, sir.
[02:22:15.715 --> 02:22:27.559]  I'm inclined to believe or agree with you and Jack and your assessment that the New World Order would love nothing more than to see an armed patriot uprising come out of this situation with Ed Miliband.
[02:22:28.779 --> 02:22:30.980]  But my question is, at what point in your perspective
[02:22:31.957 --> 02:22:35.938]  Do you feel the New World Order would not desire that kind of conflict?
[02:22:37.258 --> 02:22:45.760]  Well, no, they want it on their own terms because, peacefully, I mean, everybody, and I say everybody, literally, the majority of people are now waking up.
[02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:47.341]  Now, it's in degrees.
[02:22:48.441 --> 02:22:52.522]  But, I mean, I tell people ten years ago the IRS was a collection agency for private banks.
[02:22:52.562 --> 02:22:53.302]  They laugh at me now.
[02:22:53.362 --> 02:22:54.883]  Almost everybody I talk to knows that.
[02:22:55.843 --> 02:22:58.924]  Now, everybody's telling me, hey, you know the Federal Reserve's private?
[02:22:58.944 --> 02:22:59.764]  They took over in 1913.
[02:22:59.864 --> 02:23:00.784]  I'm like, really?
[02:23:02.200 --> 02:23:08.343]  Now, almost everybody I talk to goes, yeah, I think they let 9-11 happen, or maybe they were involved.
[02:23:08.983 --> 02:23:12.485]  And I mean, now it's in the Jerusalem Post that Israel stages terror attacks.
[02:23:12.525 --> 02:23:13.465]  That's not Alex Jones.
[02:23:14.005 --> 02:23:17.006]  Now it's in British newspapers that the British government stages terror attacks.
[02:23:17.847 --> 02:23:19.588]  I mean, now it's really coming out.
[02:23:19.648 --> 02:23:21.388]  That's why they want to make it aggressive.
[02:23:21.408 --> 02:23:22.649]  They want to make it forceful.
[02:23:23.269 --> 02:23:26.730]  They want to go in, and they want to preempt what we're doing.
[02:23:27.531 --> 02:23:30.172]  I mean, frankly, I would rather there never be some big bloody thing.
[02:23:30.874 --> 02:23:36.019]  And frankly, give amnesty to the New World Order because they're going to use nukes or something and we don't.
[02:23:36.380 --> 02:23:37.801]  And have them just leave the U.S.
[02:23:37.841 --> 02:23:38.822]  and go somewhere else.
[02:23:39.903 --> 02:23:41.825]  I mean, I'm way past the point.
[02:23:41.845 --> 02:23:43.547]  With great power comes great responsibility.
[02:23:43.828 --> 02:23:44.768]  I mean, I'm fully aware.
[02:23:44.889 --> 02:23:45.749]  I can get on the air.
[02:23:45.830 --> 02:23:47.151]  People believe in me.
[02:23:48.032 --> 02:23:49.413]  And frankly, it's very daunting.
[02:23:49.433 --> 02:23:50.554]  I'm going to make you wake up at 3 a.m.
[02:23:50.574 --> 02:23:50.955]  in the morning.
[02:23:51.579 --> 02:23:52.340]  People believe in me.
[02:23:52.380 --> 02:23:53.680]  People know I've predicted a lot of things.
[02:23:53.700 --> 02:23:55.622]  People know that I've got my head screwed on pretty straight.
[02:23:55.642 --> 02:23:56.422]  They know I live this.
[02:23:57.043 --> 02:23:59.965]  I could probably start the next American Revolution.
[02:24:00.105 --> 02:24:17.096]  I could get up, and then I could probably, you know, but I would not do that unless they were, you know, and you probably, in the case where I would need to make that call, would probably be off the air already with mass roundups and banning, you know, and nukes go off and there's, and then hit teams or will kill the Patriot leadership within hours.
[02:24:17.136 --> 02:24:20.178]  They'll try to do a mass hit, but you'll know when you see that.
[02:24:20.238 --> 02:24:21.279]  So we've talked about that.
[02:24:21.959 --> 02:24:23.020]  I don't think so.
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:49.507]  You know, I mean, I haven't lived a lifestyle where they can get me set up with a whore in a hotel room, or gambling, or like they've done to so many other people.
[02:24:50.207 --> 02:24:59.495]  I mean, I live a pretty monk-like existence of just working all the time, and my idea of a good time is eating cheese enchiladas and going for a swim, or walking around in the woods.
[02:24:59.555 --> 02:25:06.561]  So they would love to destroy me or other patriot leaders, but it isn't working anymore.
[02:25:07.221 --> 02:25:09.183]  I strongly believe that Ron Paul
[02:25:09.921 --> 02:25:14.625]  And the InfoWars are our best immediate hopes and that they are succeeding.
[02:25:15.245 --> 02:25:19.068]  Even if Ron Paul doesn't win, look at the national debate he's created.
[02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:22.631]  Look at how he's woken up so many people.
[02:25:22.891 --> 02:25:27.955]  The point is, our visibility, our profiles are rising.
[02:25:28.415 --> 02:25:30.257]  He's such an inspiring candidate.
[02:25:30.277 --> 02:25:31.578]  I've never been so inspired.
[02:25:32.399 --> 02:25:36.021]  Uh, to take action by political figures I have about Ron Paul.
[02:25:36.061 --> 02:25:37.321]  He's just an amazing man.
[02:25:37.682 --> 02:25:48.447]  In 93 and 94 after Waco, the legislature was doing an anti-UN resolution and calling for a state-level impeachment of Bill Clinton in Oklahoma, and the feds went in there and blew up a daycare center.
[02:25:48.467 --> 02:25:49.707]  They picked it because of the daycare center.
[02:25:49.727 --> 02:25:50.287]  It's now come down.
[02:25:50.307 --> 02:25:51.668]  It was a federal operation.
[02:25:51.688 --> 02:25:53.509]  That's what the local police know, and it's just a fact.
[02:25:54.446 --> 02:26:03.052]  Now, they couldn't get Patriots to rise up and go shoot up some police departments, so the BATF and the FBI with a CIA team went in there and blew that building up.
[02:26:03.732 --> 02:26:07.274]  And, you know, they've got evil teams of black ops people that do that.
[02:26:08.075 --> 02:26:10.256]  See, and I think they're probably going to do that real soon.
[02:26:10.837 --> 02:26:16.540]  But, see, we've exposed that they're behind it because they've played the card too many times.
[02:26:16.860 --> 02:26:17.781]  People know the trick.
[02:26:17.881 --> 02:26:18.702]  They've seen the magician.
[02:26:18.762 --> 02:26:23.885]  Like, if a magician does a trick five or six times in a row in front of you, you're apt to start catching the trick.
[02:26:24.737 --> 02:26:29.478]  So they've overplayed that trick, and I think if they play that trick a couple more times, it may backfire on them.
[02:26:29.518 --> 02:26:30.299]  It already is.
[02:26:31.759 --> 02:26:37.201]  So that's why we expose government-sponsored terror, because if we don't expose government-sponsored terror, they're going to keep going to that card.
[02:26:37.221 --> 02:26:38.541]  They're going to keep playing that.
[02:26:38.881 --> 02:26:41.522]  They're going to keep throwing that pitch.
[02:26:41.722 --> 02:26:48.824]  But as soon as the batter figures out when he goes to what pitch, what body language they give, now that pitch is going to backfire.
[02:26:49.424 --> 02:26:50.865]  Now you know where to swing.
[02:26:52.965 --> 02:26:56.468]  So, I mean, this is a high-level chess game we're playing here with these people.
[02:26:56.949 --> 02:27:08.759]  Well, another point, it seems to me, no future move is likely to be so far removed from a previous one by these people that it will be a flash move.
[02:27:08.779 --> 02:27:10.561]  I mean, it's so incremental.
[02:27:10.601 --> 02:27:13.023]  I don't find that there's going to be any specific event.
[02:27:13.766 --> 02:27:17.707]  It's going to spark an uprising of patriots, or even with this... Well, I don't agree.
[02:27:17.747 --> 02:27:21.068]  I mean, if you... I mean, just studying history, but let me use a Hollywood example.
[02:27:21.088 --> 02:27:21.948]  V for Vendetta.
[02:27:22.428 --> 02:27:25.128]  In fiction, when they shoot that little girl, it's on.
[02:27:26.029 --> 02:27:27.269]  And they're gonna do more of that.
[02:27:28.269 --> 02:27:30.069]  In fact, I wish they'd hold back.
[02:27:30.189 --> 02:27:30.970]  We need more time.
[02:27:36.011 --> 02:27:36.951]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.391 --> 02:27:39.031]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.051 --> 02:27:42.592]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.272 --> 02:27:50.536]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:27:50.796 --> 02:27:55.700]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:27:55.901 --> 02:27:57.262]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:27:57.402 --> 02:28:00.745]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with CalBin Soaps?
[02:28:01.005 --> 02:28:06.190]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[02:28:06.430 --> 02:28:12.195]  Marty Schachter founded CalBin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[02:28:12.535 --> 02:28:14.957]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[02:28:15.037 --> 02:28:17.378]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[02:28:17.558 --> 02:28:19.700]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:20.960]  No harsh chemicals.
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:22.121]  No animal testing.
[02:28:22.381 --> 02:28:23.702]  I use them and love them.
[02:28:23.722 --> 02:28:25.323]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:28:25.603 --> 02:28:26.724]  And I say it big time.
[02:28:27.024 --> 02:28:28.505]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:28:28.585 --> 02:28:28.865]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[02:28:28.905 --> 02:28:31.607]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[02:28:38.471 --> 02:28:40.794]  Again, that number 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:28:47.096 --> 02:28:50.859]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[02:28:51.239 --> 02:28:58.565]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[02:28:59.005 --> 02:29:09.953]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[02:29:10.033 --> 02:29:10.493]  Central.
[02:29:10.854 --> 02:29:16.438]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[02:29:16.778 --> 02:29:22.682]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[02:29:23.163 --> 02:29:27.906]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[02:29:28.287 --> 02:29:33.090]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[02:29:33.530 --> 02:29:34.831]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[02:29:34.891 --> 02:29:35.312]  Central.
[02:29:35.912 --> 02:29:43.318]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetsmen.org.
[02:29:45.925 --> 02:29:52.888]  When my son started having behavior problems, the total transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[02:29:53.128 --> 02:29:54.369]  We got immediate results.
[02:29:54.709 --> 02:29:59.431]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual when he's disrespectful, defiant, or even abusive?
[02:29:59.711 --> 02:30:00.511]  Do you know how to fix it?
[02:30:00.951 --> 02:30:06.334]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior right now with the Total Transformation.
[02:30:06.614 --> 02:30:09.635]  The program that helps you fix every behavior problem under the sun.
[02:30:10.035 --> 02:30:15.039]  Defiance, back talking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.
[02:30:15.259 --> 02:30:18.021]  There's no screaming, no fighting, no frustration.
[02:30:18.321 --> 02:30:23.285]  The Total Transformation is the program I've used for over 30 years to solve even the worst behavior problems.
[02:30:23.625 --> 02:30:27.348]  Your child will listen to you again and you'll get peace and sanity back into your home.
[02:30:27.689 --> 02:30:28.349]  I guarantee it.
[02:30:28.729 --> 02:30:32.933]  Call now and get how to turn your child's attitude around in one minute or less free with your order.
[02:30:33.473 --> 02:30:35.433]  1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-
[02:31:02.245 --> 02:31:07.067]  Financial Times of London, Putin calls for new financial world order, and the end of the dollar.
[02:31:09.128 --> 02:31:10.929]  Man, you see, they're not doing it militarily.
[02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:15.511]  Person that uses force first loses.
[02:31:16.431 --> 02:31:16.751]  U.S.
[02:31:16.872 --> 02:31:19.253]  arming Sunni insurgents in Iraq.
[02:31:20.053 --> 02:31:23.114]  New York Times, of course, Sunnis, by the way, that's Al Qaeda.
[02:31:24.895 --> 02:31:25.515]  Heaven help us.
[02:31:25.535 --> 02:31:27.876]  I got a bunch of this.
[02:31:28.016 --> 02:31:29.117]  It's just, I can't believe it.
[02:31:30.337 --> 02:31:31.398]  It's so bad, folks.
[02:31:32.375 --> 02:31:40.640]  And then you've got a bunch of idiot FBI out there and federal marshals surrounding a family, surrounding a man and a woman, retirees basically.
[02:31:41.240 --> 02:31:41.760]  Older folks.
[02:31:41.780 --> 02:31:42.621]  I don't want to call them elderly.
[02:31:42.641 --> 02:31:43.641]  Everybody keeps calling them elderly.
[02:31:43.661 --> 02:31:44.302]  They're not elderly.
[02:31:45.102 --> 02:31:46.083]  But over the hill, folks.
[02:31:49.845 --> 02:31:51.086]  I just can't believe it anymore.
[02:31:51.246 --> 02:31:53.007]  I mean, it's just, it's just, it's just a joke.
[02:31:53.367 --> 02:31:58.810]  The globalists are busy still trying to intimidate their slaves here in America when the whole thing's unraveling anyways.
[02:32:01.224 --> 02:32:04.686]  It always happens that you get these yes men up in their ivory towers and they think they know it all.
[02:32:05.726 --> 02:32:07.407]  I haven't plugged my films really all day.
[02:32:08.207 --> 02:32:14.470]  And frankly I've been so busy plugging other sponsors and having guests on and covering the crises Thursday and Friday we didn't really do any advertising.
[02:32:15.410 --> 02:32:17.911]  I've made some of the best films out there bar none.
[02:32:17.931 --> 02:32:22.033]  You need to go to Infowars.com and get... By the way, Terror Storm is sold out like I told you it would.
[02:32:22.433 --> 02:32:24.714]  We've got about 40 Terror Storms left.
[02:32:26.035 --> 02:32:28.736]  So since Friday it hasn't been available for individual purchase.
[02:32:29.739 --> 02:32:35.381]  I've gotten a couple combo deals and an Alex Everything Special, but it looks like those are all about to go.
[02:32:35.421 --> 02:32:38.022]  I've got about 30 or 40 left, he said, right before I went on air.
[02:32:38.722 --> 02:32:40.683]  So, the original Terror Storm will be gone.
[02:32:42.163 --> 02:32:48.045]  I'm trying to get 50 left that were at a bookstore I know of, who says they might agree to sell them back to me.
[02:32:50.566 --> 02:32:59.049]  The point is that we're going to fill your mail orders that just came in, and we're going to fill a few more orders that come in at InfoWars.com, but then it's gone.
[02:33:00.879 --> 02:33:07.563]  Then you'll get the Terror Storm 2nd Edition, which I've got thousands of sitting here in my office, but I agree with the distributor, I can't sell them until later in July.
[02:33:07.583 --> 02:33:10.545]  In a few days, we'll have pre-sales for those up.
[02:33:11.965 --> 02:33:14.687]  I'm so busy, I don't even have time to do a write-up on the new film to get it up there.
[02:33:14.707 --> 02:33:22.391]  But the point is, we got America, Freedom, and Fascism, which we actually bought from Aaron Russo, the original, from him, not some bootleg.
[02:33:22.612 --> 02:33:28.395]  Which, bootlegs are fine, it's just that we're actually supporting Aaron, and you support us as well, when you get America, Freedom, and Fascism from us.
[02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:35.566]  Loose Change 2nd Edition, Riddles in Stone, all of it available at Infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:33:35.586 --> 02:33:35.626]  888-253-3139.
[02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:45.152]  We're beefing up the servers right now for PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:45.172 --> 02:33:47.274]  There was a few hiccups this morning, but it's up and running.
[02:33:47.294 --> 02:33:48.415]  You'll get a membership there as well.
[02:33:48.935 --> 02:33:50.036]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:50.817 --> 02:34:00.985]  But again, 888-253-3139 is the toll free number to call and get the hard copy DVDs and make copies of them and get them out to people.
[02:34:02.707 --> 02:34:08.432]  Copies of Terror Storm and Loose Change and 9-11 Mysteries and all the other original DVDs that we offer at Infowars.com.
[02:34:08.732 --> 02:34:10.914]  Now I'm going to get into this news and we will at least get to
[02:34:11.992 --> 02:34:15.677]  Mark, John, Glenn and Wayne and a few others before we end the show.
[02:34:16.358 --> 02:34:18.441]  But just for a few minutes here, I wanted to bring up Adam Locke.
[02:34:18.481 --> 02:34:19.823]  He wasn't on with us last week either.
[02:34:19.863 --> 02:34:21.105]  He comes up usually once a week.
[02:34:21.606 --> 02:34:28.716]  New Millennium Concepts, the Made in America, American Berkey, but also the National Distributor for the British Made Big Berkey.
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:30.080]  I think so.
[02:34:45.269 --> 02:34:46.469]  And you get free gifts for that.
[02:34:46.610 --> 02:34:48.270]  A powerful LED flashlight.
[02:34:48.370 --> 02:34:48.610]  One that's $39.
[02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:50.251]  One that's $29.
[02:34:50.511 --> 02:34:54.552]  Your choice, free, when you get the $195 model or $199 model.
[02:34:55.032 --> 02:34:58.713]  You get free gifts of sports bottles, filters, whatever you want.
[02:34:59.013 --> 02:35:03.055]  A bunch of great stuff up there at Berkeywater.com.
[02:35:03.075 --> 02:35:09.997]  Just in the comments section, tell them it's an Alex Jones special and what free gift you want at Berkeywater.com or via InfoWars.com.
[02:35:10.017 --> 02:35:13.318]  You can order there off the SecureSafe shopping cart as well.
[02:35:14.913 --> 02:35:17.355]  Or you can give them a call.
[02:35:17.796 --> 02:35:19.457]  And Adam, thanks for coming up with us.
[02:35:19.937 --> 02:35:21.238]  Well, Alex, always a pleasure.
[02:35:21.258 --> 02:35:22.319]  Thank you for having me on.
[02:35:22.359 --> 02:35:27.344]  And yes, the other thing you do, of course, is call Debbie at 888-803-4438.
[02:35:27.884 --> 02:35:34.109]  Debbie is very familiar with all the specials that are being offered for your listeners and is always happy to talk to your listeners, too.
[02:35:34.149 --> 02:35:38.293]  They're very intelligent, informed people when it comes to listening to your show, of course.
[02:35:38.980 --> 02:35:43.822]  Well, we're just blessed that we have listeners that support us, and I want to support them by having good products.
[02:35:44.402 --> 02:35:48.704]  And you get a discount, it's made in America, and you also get a free gift at the same time.
[02:35:49.724 --> 02:35:52.425]  I mean, I could get up here and say hurricane season's coming, get your Berkey.
[02:35:52.885 --> 02:35:57.587]  If you're in Florida, Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, whatever, North Carolina, South Carolina.
[02:35:57.947 --> 02:35:58.807]  They all get hit by it.
[02:35:59.087 --> 02:36:02.488]  Or I could say, they could have martial law or depression and the water won't work.
[02:36:02.548 --> 02:36:02.808]  Get it.
[02:36:03.228 --> 02:36:04.749]  That's not the real reasons to get it.
[02:36:04.789 --> 02:36:06.269]  Those are added fresh benefits.
[02:36:06.529 --> 02:36:16.071]  The real reason is the water is filled with fluoride, with mercury, with arsenic, with chlorine, with dead bacteria that it kills.
[02:36:16.811 --> 02:36:18.612]  I mean, fish don't live in pool water.
[02:36:19.172 --> 02:36:23.593]  And I've had a lot of pool guys I know, and I heard about this, so I asked a pool guy one time to do a test.
[02:36:24.267 --> 02:36:28.190]  And we took some tap water out of a water hose and tested it right by the local community pool.
[02:36:28.550 --> 02:36:30.992]  It had more chemicals than a swimming pool.
[02:36:31.472 --> 02:36:33.394]  Bottom line, folks, fish die in a swimming pool.
[02:36:33.614 --> 02:36:34.735]  You're not supposed to be drinking it.
[02:36:34.775 --> 02:36:35.175]  Now, Adam?
[02:36:36.459 --> 02:36:37.300]  Very, very true.
[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:40.581]  You know, my job here isn't to scare people either, Alex.
[02:36:40.621 --> 02:36:49.083]  We do talk about things like hurricane season, but what I like to bring forward are things that people should do to think ahead of time and be prepared, such as a water purifier.
[02:36:49.103 --> 02:36:51.164]  But there are so many other things to think about.
[02:36:51.704 --> 02:36:59.507]  You should be sitting down with your family now and making a checklist, planning ahead, so you're ready when or should something happen.
[02:37:00.351 --> 02:37:01.611]  You know, where's your pet food?
[02:37:01.631 --> 02:37:02.552]  Where's all your pet stuff?
[02:37:02.612 --> 02:37:07.253]  Put your documents in Ziploc bags or a waterproof safe.
[02:37:07.273 --> 02:37:08.593]  A lot of things to think about.
[02:37:08.933 --> 02:37:12.294]  Cell phones, cordless phones, they're probably not going to work if you get hit.
[02:37:12.414 --> 02:37:12.934]  Think ahead.
[02:37:12.954 --> 02:37:15.235]  Do you have an old rotary phone, an old punch button phone?
[02:37:15.715 --> 02:37:16.575]  Keep it handy.
[02:37:17.135 --> 02:37:18.756]  Now, ABC is a home preparation.
[02:37:19.096 --> 02:37:20.596]  Anchor, brace, and cover.
[02:37:21.016 --> 02:37:22.716]  Make sure stuff in your yard is in.
[02:37:23.357 --> 02:37:25.897]  Make sure it's covered or it's tied down.
[02:37:25.917 --> 02:37:27.517]  There's just a lot of things to think about.
[02:37:27.577 --> 02:37:28.398]  Personal essentials.
[02:37:28.418 --> 02:37:29.898]  This is one that gets a lot of people.
[02:37:30.218 --> 02:37:31.158]  Your first aid kit.
[02:37:31.178 --> 02:37:32.178]  Do you have it in your car?
[02:37:32.198 --> 02:37:33.359]  Do you have it in your home?
[02:37:33.379 --> 02:37:35.059]  Have you looked at it recently?
[02:37:35.359 --> 02:37:39.640]  If you've got kids, I can almost guarantee you're missing something out of there.
[02:37:39.980 --> 02:37:40.900]  Not that they're stealing it.
[02:37:40.940 --> 02:37:41.500]  They use it.
[02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:42.721]  They don't bother to tell you.
[02:37:43.021 --> 02:37:44.581]  And when you need that first aid kit,
[02:37:45.305 --> 02:37:47.426]  What you need may very well not be there.
[02:37:47.586 --> 02:37:48.487]  No, it's really simple.
[02:37:48.527 --> 02:37:49.768]  People need storable food.
[02:37:50.028 --> 02:37:51.329]  They need firearms.
[02:37:51.369 --> 02:37:52.689]  They need some precious metals.
[02:37:53.170 --> 02:37:55.771]  And they need, uh, number one is water.
[02:37:56.191 --> 02:38:03.015]  Ate... Uh, everything okay?
[02:38:05.437 --> 02:38:06.517]  His, his phone dropped.
[02:38:06.537 --> 02:38:07.878]  Well, that almost blew my eardrums out.
[02:38:07.918 --> 02:38:08.779]  That was loud.
[02:38:09.859 --> 02:38:13.041]  Uh, his, uh, speaking of emergencies, everything say okay then?
[02:38:15.633 --> 02:38:16.294]  Uh, it's alright.
[02:38:16.954 --> 02:38:18.474]  Listen, just folks, give them a call.
[02:38:19.695 --> 02:38:20.215]  I believe in this.
[02:38:20.235 --> 02:38:21.095]  I've got survival foods.
[02:38:21.175 --> 02:38:22.536]  I've got firearms and a gun safe.
[02:38:22.636 --> 02:38:23.416]  I know how to use them.
[02:38:23.836 --> 02:38:24.457]  I mean, I'm ready.
[02:38:25.617 --> 02:38:30.219]  And, uh, emergencies happen all the time, but that's not why you get a water filter.
[02:38:30.239 --> 02:38:31.399]  The water is full of poison.
[02:38:31.419 --> 02:38:35.381]  888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com.
[02:38:35.561 --> 02:38:38.142]  Okay, let's jam these calls in right now, then I'll get to all this news.
[02:38:38.162 --> 02:38:43.684]  888-803-4438 or check the banners out at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:38:46.154 --> 02:38:47.054]  Oh, that's what it was.
[02:38:47.074 --> 02:38:48.415]  I didn't think it was Adam.
[02:38:48.455 --> 02:38:50.115]  I didn't think a phone line could sound like that.
[02:38:50.175 --> 02:38:54.196]  It's the, uh, it's the, uh, Genesis stuff there.
[02:38:55.656 --> 02:38:57.536]  Are the phones back up?
[02:38:57.636 --> 02:38:58.977]  Are we even on the air there, brother?
[02:39:02.297 --> 02:39:03.077]  Oh, the phones are up.
[02:39:03.117 --> 02:39:08.379]  Man, I mean, I try to keep the audio where it's not too loud, because I was basically going deaf from having the headset too loud.
[02:39:08.419 --> 02:39:11.619]  It was so loud, even with the audio down, it almost blew my eardrums out.
[02:39:11.639 --> 02:39:15.320]  I was thinking, man, that doesn't sound like somebody's phone line going out.
[02:39:15.979 --> 02:39:18.841]  That sounds like... Did people hear that noise on air?
[02:39:18.861 --> 02:39:24.844]  I don't know if people heard all... I don't know, I'm just... Yeah, we're done.
[02:39:25.804 --> 02:39:29.486]  And if all those callers can get back in, they're welcome to at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:39:29.506 --> 02:39:31.828]  Let's go ahead and go back to the news here.
[02:39:39.284 --> 02:39:41.606]  Again, I could talk about this all day, but we'll spend 30 seconds on it.
[02:39:41.966 --> 02:39:44.409]  Military plan against Iran is ready, Jerusalem Post.
[02:39:44.769 --> 02:39:46.330]  They've also called for preemptive strike.
[02:39:46.811 --> 02:39:51.535]  Predicting that Iran will obtain a nuclear weapon within three years, thought they were going to get it within five minutes.
[02:39:51.935 --> 02:39:53.797]  And they're claiming to have a strike plan in place.
[02:39:53.837 --> 02:40:04.046]  Senior Army military officials, American military officials, have told the Jerusalem Post they support President George Bush's stance to do everything necessary to stop the Islamic Republic's race for nuclear power.
[02:40:05.294 --> 02:40:14.364]  Really, word is that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Marine, went in and told Bush that half his General Staff is going to quit if they attack Iran and Bush said, get out of my, you're fired.
[02:40:16.086 --> 02:40:17.227]  But hey, you know, what do you know?
[02:40:18.149 --> 02:40:26.498]  Bush has repeatedly said the United States would not allow Iran to go nuclear, a high-ranking, but Pakistan we helped arm, and that was a good idea.
[02:40:27.213 --> 02:40:29.854]  And China threatening to nuke us at press conferences, but that's okay.
[02:40:30.354 --> 02:40:34.955]  A high-ranking American military officer told the Post that senior officials in the U.S.
[02:40:34.995 --> 02:40:40.357]  Armed Forces had thrown their support behind Bush and believed the additional steps needed to be taken to stop Iran.
[02:40:40.877 --> 02:40:44.678]  And it says that predictions within the U.S.
[02:40:44.698 --> 02:40:51.660]  military are that Bush will do what is needed, do what must be done, to stop Tehran before he leaves office in 2009.
[02:40:52.020 --> 02:40:52.900]  Yeah, may never leave.
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:56.481]  Including possibly launching a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities.
[02:40:57.702 --> 02:40:59.323]  And it's going to be called terrorism.
[02:40:59.343 --> 02:41:00.524]  I have another article today.
[02:41:00.544 --> 02:41:05.348]  They say if Iran fights back in any way, it's going to be called terrorism, and then they're going to start dropping nukes on them.
[02:41:05.808 --> 02:41:14.575]  Now you can imagine, we're going to bomb, they say, their entire military, all their ships, their entire infrastructure, their power plants, anything that can, quote, support their nuclear program.
[02:41:14.595 --> 02:41:15.196]  That's official.
[02:41:15.636 --> 02:41:23.702]  We're talking about a month-long, thousands of Saudis every week, tens of thousands of bombing raids, hundreds of thousands of munitions to be dropped.
[02:41:24.183 --> 02:41:26.825]  And if Iran does one thing
[02:41:27.549 --> 02:41:29.850]  The news is gonna go, My God, they're evil!
[02:41:30.310 --> 02:41:31.451]  Can you imagine them?
[02:41:31.491 --> 02:41:32.311]  They fought back!
[02:41:32.331 --> 02:41:35.233]  No one's ever heard of something that evil!
[02:41:35.833 --> 02:41:38.374]  No one's ever heard of that type of viciousness!
[02:41:40.335 --> 02:41:43.476]  And there they are in the news going, These terrorists may actually fight back!
[02:41:44.437 --> 02:41:47.138]  Of course, the plan is that when they do fight back, then you're off to the races.
[02:41:51.445 --> 02:41:53.466]  Now, let me get to this next story.
[02:41:53.566 --> 02:41:53.806]  U.S.
[02:41:53.846 --> 02:41:55.467]  Immigration Bill alive and well.
[02:41:55.587 --> 02:41:59.348]  AP, the White House, insists Sunday that radical plans to overhaul the U.S.
[02:41:59.368 --> 02:42:00.589]  immigration system were not dead.
[02:42:01.109 --> 02:42:01.709]  Well, of course not.
[02:42:01.729 --> 02:42:03.270]  They've been reintroducing it for six years.
[02:42:03.290 --> 02:42:04.010]  They're not going to stop.
[02:42:04.590 --> 02:42:11.113]  And by the way, by fiat, these people are all legal in sanctuary cities and the rest of it, and federal judges are blocking any city that tries to follow the law.
[02:42:11.953 --> 02:42:14.474]  The Border Patrol is told not to stop them, and in most sectors now.
[02:42:16.046 --> 02:42:16.627]  Absolutely.
[02:42:16.667 --> 02:42:17.587]  Folks, you think they're done?
[02:42:17.607 --> 02:42:17.908]  No, no.
[02:42:18.228 --> 02:42:23.331]  The new one just legalizes child molesters, MS-13, gives them five years of tax amnesty.
[02:42:23.792 --> 02:42:25.293]  Again, because they're not American citizens.
[02:42:25.333 --> 02:42:27.675]  If you're some old people, you've got to die, according to them.
[02:42:28.415 --> 02:42:30.416]  The Civil Reform Drive, backed by U.S.
[02:42:30.476 --> 02:42:39.863]  President George W. Bush to bring 12 million illegal immigrants out of the shadows, collapsed late Thursday after a night of high drama in the Democratic-controlled Congress.
[02:42:40.163 --> 02:42:41.264]  That was all stage two.
[02:42:41.284 --> 02:42:42.585]  The Democrats like what they got.
[02:42:44.170 --> 02:42:45.971]  And they don't want to, quote, give Bush a victory.
[02:42:46.832 --> 02:42:47.833]  And again, J.C.
[02:42:47.873 --> 02:42:58.540]  Watts and all these fake conservatives lie on Wolf Blitzer every day and say, oh no, because I've been watching it, they say, oh no, American conservatives are mad because Bush can't get something done.
[02:42:58.580 --> 02:43:00.261]  They want this and the Democrats are mad, too.
[02:43:00.802 --> 02:43:08.347]  Can't we just get something, like, like, like, like, you know, get something done, go ahead and cut your leg off, gotta get something done, go ahead and jump off a cliff, gotta get something done.
[02:43:09.025 --> 02:43:15.028]  It's like you're sitting in an easy chair, high and dry and doing well, and they go, you better set yourself on fire and do something!
[02:43:15.048 --> 02:43:22.292]  You know, something's got to be... But just think about the monumental lying we've been treated to.
[02:43:25.133 --> 02:43:31.556]  The monumental lying where the government just says, it's not Amnesty, and we get the bill, and it's worse!
[02:43:31.676 --> 02:43:32.377]  I apologize.
[02:43:32.717 --> 02:43:34.398]  I was saying it was the original Kennedy bill.
[02:43:34.818 --> 02:43:36.119]  People were like, oh no, it's not.
[02:43:36.479 --> 02:43:37.479]  It's worse than that.
[02:43:37.519 --> 02:43:38.560]  This is unbelievable.
[02:43:40.487 --> 02:43:41.867]  It's worse than amnesty, okay?
[02:43:41.907 --> 02:43:45.628]  It's legalization of aggravated felons and tax amnesty.
[02:43:46.388 --> 02:43:47.129]  Tax pardon.
[02:43:48.889 --> 02:43:58.491]  Democratic leader Harry Reba drew the landmark measure after Senators seeking to add amendments to the bill voted twice within nine hours not to move it towards a final vote as he had demanded.
[02:43:58.511 --> 02:44:03.633]  Because, Bob, the Democrats didn't want to take out any of the really evil stuff in there that Bush and them had agreed on.
[02:44:03.913 --> 02:44:05.053]  Five Senators from both
[02:44:05.862 --> 02:44:06.924]  Parties, secretly.
[02:44:07.184 --> 02:44:09.207]  Remember, for a month, you couldn't know!
[02:44:09.467 --> 02:44:11.890]  Just trust us, it's not amnesty, but you can't see it!
[02:44:12.391 --> 02:44:13.813]  We're the government, we don't lie!
[02:44:15.319 --> 02:44:17.761]  Putin calls for new financial world order.
[02:44:18.142 --> 02:44:28.510]  Russian President Vladimir Putin called on Sunday for a radical overhaul of the world's financial and trade institutions to reflect the growing economic power of emerging market countries, including Russia.
[02:44:28.971 --> 02:44:36.497]  Mr. Putin said the world needed to create a new international financial architecture to replace the existing model that had become an archaic, undemocratic, and unwieldy.
[02:44:36.977 --> 02:44:38.899]  Now, you think that's the Chinese-Russian model.
[02:44:38.919 --> 02:44:39.880]  They're all in bed together.
[02:44:40.160 --> 02:44:43.904]  No, you listen to what these fake strategists who claim they're anti-New World Order.
[02:44:44.244 --> 02:44:48.348]  They're just trying to co-opt our movement when they tell us Russia's good and China's good.
[02:44:48.448 --> 02:44:49.449]  It's a bunch of baloney.
[02:44:51.311 --> 02:44:52.492]  The globalists made deals.
[02:44:52.912 --> 02:45:00.800]  Look at the body language, not just the body language of Bush and Putin and the Chinese communist dictators, but look at their actions, their deals, their agreements.
[02:45:01.941 --> 02:45:03.743]  What the Trilateral Commission said in 1973 was,
[02:45:05.732 --> 02:45:18.741]  The Republican 74 is that they're going to bring down the dollar, bring up the euro, merge that with China and Russia, and then we're going to create an Amaro in the name of competing, but really they're going to globalize that and peg it to the same benchmark pretty much immediately.
[02:45:20.642 --> 02:45:21.883]  And now what do you hear them doing?
[02:45:22.063 --> 02:45:23.824]  Oh, we need an Amaro to compete with the euro.
[02:45:24.625 --> 02:45:27.467]  For over 10 years I've been telling you that and reading the documents, okay?
[02:45:28.267 --> 02:45:29.668]  I mean, we know what we're talking about.
[02:45:29.708 --> 02:45:30.149]  It's not hard.
[02:45:30.189 --> 02:45:31.890]  We went and studied what the globalists said.
[02:45:33.379 --> 02:45:37.801]  I mean, the government people listening who go, oh, that guy's a conspiracy terrorist, I don't know if I should listen to him or not.
[02:45:38.361 --> 02:45:43.643]  I remember feds on TV ten years ago saying Bilderberg didn't exist and it was code for terror.
[02:45:44.083 --> 02:45:48.665]  Now it's in the Dallas Morning News and the Boston American Statesman.
[02:45:51.346 --> 02:45:56.668]  I mean, just because you don't want to believe me, I want to think you work for the good guys, that doesn't change the fact you work for crooks.
[02:46:03.892 --> 02:46:11.338]  It goes on, businesses deal with more than $4 billion were signed at the conference, including an order by Aeroflot of Boeing.
[02:46:11.398 --> 02:46:17.843]  It goes on, his apparent challenge to Western dominance of world economic order came at a forum.
[02:46:17.863 --> 02:46:22.346]  Had to sneeze there with the cough button.
[02:46:23.587 --> 02:46:24.688]  Then it goes on to say in St.
[02:46:24.708 --> 02:46:26.990]  Petersburg, designed to showcase the country's economic recovery.
[02:46:27.768 --> 02:46:35.930]  And then it goes on to say there were chief executives from the heads of Deutsche Bank, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Neste, Chevron, Siemens, and Coca-Cola.
[02:46:36.310 --> 02:46:37.530]  All Bilderberg members.
[02:46:37.971 --> 02:46:38.951]  Folks, we're in deep trouble.
[02:46:39.571 --> 02:46:39.791]  See?
[02:46:41.311 --> 02:46:45.132]  Everybody liked being part of the fiat money system until they started pulling the rug out from under us.
[02:46:46.513 --> 02:46:47.113]  Here's another one.
[02:46:47.133 --> 02:46:47.793]  New York Times.
[02:46:47.993 --> 02:46:48.133]  U.S.
[02:46:48.273 --> 02:46:52.394]  arming Sunni insurgents in Iraq and into Iran as well.
[02:46:52.434 --> 02:46:53.994]  That's Al-Qaeda attacking Iran.
[02:46:54.034 --> 02:46:56.015]  If Iran fights back, they're called Al-Qaeda.
[02:46:57.705 --> 02:47:12.736]  With the four-month-old increase in American troops showing only modest success, that's a total lie, and curbing insurgent attacks have actually increased, American commanders are turning to another strategy that they acknowledge is fraught with risk, arming Sunni Arab groups that have promised to fight militants.
[02:47:18.900 --> 02:47:19.801]  Oh my gosh.
[02:47:20.862 --> 02:47:24.964]  Rolling Stone to print their propaganda publication in a
[02:47:26.738 --> 02:47:30.699]  Carbon footprint reduced paper, but then they did a study.
[02:47:31.119 --> 02:47:34.780]  It'll actually use more energy with the amount of hauling and chemicals and things that are needed.
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.581]  The carbon footprint's bigger, but it's never about that.
[02:47:37.961 --> 02:47:39.542]  It's about the religion.
[02:47:39.582 --> 02:47:48.585]  I have a clip of even Michael Crichton, the famous, you know, and his famous author, but he's also an anthropologist, but talking about how it's the new religion and how that actually hurts the environment.
[02:47:48.885 --> 02:47:49.425]  And it does!
[02:47:49.505 --> 02:47:53.386]  The global corporations get to have you all worried about carbon dioxide,
[02:47:54.116 --> 02:47:58.038]  That the plants love, and then they put out more oxygen for animal life.
[02:47:58.739 --> 02:48:02.041]  And it's shown the earth is much healthier in a higher carbon dioxide environment.
[02:48:02.121 --> 02:48:02.821]  Major studies.
[02:48:03.782 --> 02:48:06.343]  And then set up a global tax to deal with it.
[02:48:06.643 --> 02:48:09.265]  Instead of the real crisis, chimera across species.
[02:48:09.925 --> 02:48:12.467]  That is causing massive biosphere crises worldwide.
[02:48:12.807 --> 02:48:15.008]  And massive problems in insects, plants, and animals.
[02:48:16.289 --> 02:48:19.090]  And toxic waste dumping, good old fashioned things like that.
[02:48:19.671 --> 02:48:20.751]  No, they'll just have you worried.
[02:48:23.129 --> 02:48:24.471]  I haven't even gotten to this yet.
[02:48:24.911 --> 02:48:25.692]  Oh my gosh.
[02:48:25.712 --> 02:48:26.953]  I've got loaded phone lines here.
[02:48:26.973 --> 02:48:28.975]  We're going to jam in some calls when we get back.
[02:48:30.477 --> 02:48:32.899]  And then G8 false flag terror attack averted.
[02:48:33.420 --> 02:48:33.620]  U.S.
[02:48:33.660 --> 02:48:38.786]  security men attempted to smuggle C4 plastic explosives past checkpoint at G8.
[02:48:39.586 --> 02:48:40.588]  And they've done it before.
[02:48:41.168 --> 02:48:42.690]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:48:48.988 --> 02:48:54.458]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.839 --> 02:49:02.432]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.163 --> 02:49:10.226]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.606 --> 02:49:22.031]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.351 --> 02:49:25.853]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.313 --> 02:49:28.234]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.574 --> 02:49:32.356]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:46.653 --> 02:49:55.718]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[02:49:55.958 --> 02:50:07.203]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:50:07.524 --> 02:50:12.366]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[02:50:12.586 --> 02:50:12.746]  I think?
[02:50:31.288 --> 02:50:31.849]  Let's get it!
[02:50:45.723 --> 02:50:47.444]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:47.644 --> 02:50:51.367]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been murderized.
[02:50:51.687 --> 02:50:53.888]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[02:50:54.409 --> 02:51:00.613]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:51:00.773 --> 02:51:05.676]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:05.876 --> 02:51:14.842]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[02:51:53.004 --> 02:51:58.248]  They're now passing laws to ban home gardens.
[02:51:58.468 --> 02:52:01.950]  It's all about getting control.
[02:52:22.003 --> 02:52:23.843]  Let's just jam in a pastel of coals.
[02:52:25.864 --> 02:52:27.224]  Big news up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:52:27.264 --> 02:52:28.824]  I should have started the show with this today.
[02:52:28.864 --> 02:52:30.465]  G8 false flag terror averted.
[02:52:31.085 --> 02:52:31.245]  U.S.
[02:52:31.285 --> 02:52:34.986]  security men attempted to smuggle in C4 blast explosives, were caught by German police.
[02:52:35.406 --> 02:52:36.886]  Then they claimed it was part of a drill.
[02:52:37.066 --> 02:52:44.808]  See, just like on 7-7, the British government with a private company was running a drill of the exact same bus and trains at the exact same time being bombed.
[02:52:45.128 --> 02:52:46.788]  That way if they get caught, oh, it's just a drill.
[02:52:47.088 --> 02:52:50.209]  When the Russians got caught planting bombs in a building by Moscow police,
[02:52:50.589 --> 02:52:51.530]  They said it was a drill.
[02:52:51.810 --> 02:52:53.311]  On 9-11 the government ran a drill.
[02:52:53.592 --> 02:52:56.234]  That way if you get caught, you also fund your operations of the drill.
[02:52:56.494 --> 02:52:57.675]  You say it's just part of a drill.
[02:52:58.116 --> 02:53:01.979]  And then I brought up the BBC article from the last G8, well it was G8 a few years ago.
[02:53:02.439 --> 02:53:07.984]  Genoa police admit fabrication planting bombs on protesters as an excuse to physically attack them.
[02:53:09.265 --> 02:53:12.908]  So we don't know if they were planning to set the bombs off or just plant them on people.
[02:53:15.170 --> 02:53:16.992]  Oh no, our government wouldn't hurt us, they love us.
[02:53:18.150 --> 02:53:19.031]  Let's go to John.
[02:53:19.431 --> 02:53:20.252]  John, you're on the air.
[02:53:20.272 --> 02:53:20.472]  Go ahead.
[02:53:20.492 --> 02:53:21.353]  Where are you calling from?
[02:53:22.554 --> 02:53:23.335]  Calling from Texas.
[02:53:23.535 --> 02:53:23.855]  Welcome.
[02:53:23.875 --> 02:53:25.457]  Go ahead.
[02:53:25.477 --> 02:53:27.198]  Say, one observation yesterday.
[02:53:27.218 --> 02:53:28.780]  I noticed Ron Paul was there at an event.
[02:53:28.840 --> 02:53:31.462]  I was there, and there was no security, which may be a good thing.
[02:53:31.842 --> 02:53:37.327]  But more importantly, I wanted to say that we had a situation where a police chief was replaced by another police chief here.
[02:53:37.347 --> 02:53:38.508]  He was unknown.
[02:53:38.548 --> 02:53:40.490]  He was on the force for about two years originally.
[02:53:40.510 --> 02:53:42.832]  He retired from the Marines.
[02:53:43.917 --> 02:53:49.681]  He was made the police chief, much to the amazement of many of the people in the city, because nobody knew him.
[02:53:50.361 --> 02:53:52.683]  And after about three years, we have swarming.
[02:53:52.783 --> 02:53:53.823]  I call it swarming.
[02:53:54.404 --> 02:53:58.306]  He gets pulled over for a little old lady.
[02:53:58.326 --> 02:53:59.327]  He'll be sitting on the side of the road.
[02:53:59.387 --> 02:54:04.450]  And we've got three policemen that just rush to aid their buddies in there.
[02:54:05.010 --> 02:54:07.712]  All the police were replaced by younger military type people.
[02:54:07.792 --> 02:54:08.873]  And I'll let you comment.
[02:54:09.013 --> 02:54:09.693]  Where do you live?
[02:54:10.433 --> 02:54:11.114]  Princewood, Texas.
[02:54:12.105 --> 02:54:20.269]  Well, they're putting FBI, former FBI, former federal marshals, former generals in over schools, universities, police departments.
[02:54:20.309 --> 02:54:24.251]  It's all part of a PDD-25 Red Dawn slow-motion takeover.
[02:54:25.695 --> 02:54:29.259]  Well, uh, yeah, and that's what we're seeing.
[02:54:29.279 --> 02:54:36.746]  Another person that got to the point that he didn't want to come to our town, he says the same thing has happened in his town, in Alvin, Texas, just to the south.
[02:54:37.226 --> 02:54:38.187]  Oh, it's bad, I know.
[02:54:38.648 --> 02:54:39.749]  Look, they're taking us down.
[02:54:39.789 --> 02:54:40.670]  They mean business.
[02:54:41.190 --> 02:54:44.493]  They've got to hand over all the infrastructure to foreign banks and corporations, and they're doing it.
[02:54:45.174 --> 02:54:47.657]  And these military men will follow their orders to destroy the country.
[02:54:48.117 --> 02:54:49.038]  Thanks for the call, John.
[02:54:49.078 --> 02:54:50.019]  Who's up next year in order?
[02:54:52.288 --> 02:54:53.469]  Wayne in Vancouver, Canada.
[02:54:53.489 --> 02:54:54.450]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:54:55.050 --> 02:54:57.172]  Hey Alex, good to talk to you.
[02:54:57.352 --> 02:55:00.995]  A couple of things, I'll try and be as quick as I can, because I know you're up against the clock here.
[02:55:01.796 --> 02:55:10.503]  First off, I just want to say my heart goes out to the Brown family there, and we in Canada ask that this illegal action be halted until the government can show the law.
[02:55:11.364 --> 02:55:19.431]  The people have done no wrong, and I want Canadians to support them by calling the CBC, calling the CTV, and calling Prime Minister Harper and tell him about it.
[02:55:20.151 --> 02:55:20.812]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:55:44.631 --> 02:55:48.795]  I just wanted to mention that I believe Elaine said it best.
[02:55:48.915 --> 02:55:53.439]  I'd like us to all remember that there is a spiritual side to this.
[02:55:54.640 --> 02:55:57.383]  And I'd like to see some clergy get involved, maybe in the local area.
[02:55:57.443 --> 02:55:58.404]  I'm just alone.
[02:55:59.184 --> 02:56:03.248]  They're all too busy driving around in their Cadillacs living in million-dollar parsonages.
[02:56:03.989 --> 02:56:05.029]  Elaine said it best.
[02:56:05.070 --> 02:56:08.633]  I mean, no matter what you get on this earth, you're going to have to answer for eternity for it.
[02:56:08.813 --> 02:56:10.995]  I mean, people, whether you're in a job,
[02:56:12.519 --> 02:56:15.042]  And you feel like you're doing your job, that's no excuse.
[02:56:15.843 --> 02:56:16.764]  Absolutely.
[02:56:17.004 --> 02:56:17.725]  We're out of time.
[02:56:18.285 --> 02:56:19.927]  Alright, back tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:19.947 --> 02:56:23.871]  11 to 2 Central and on the stream 24 hours a day at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:23.891 --> 02:56:24.632]  God bless you all.
