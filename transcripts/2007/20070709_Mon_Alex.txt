[00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:06.528]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.188 --> 00:00:08.269]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:10.069]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:11.530]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.190]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.511]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:22.133]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:33.171]  Yeah, I think.
[00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:06.224]  Wake up, boys, there's a light at the window.
[00:01:06.244 --> 00:01:11.327]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:17.872]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet.
[00:01:18.632 --> 00:01:21.534]  And they whisper the word, Revelation.
[00:01:23.796 --> 00:01:27.939]  There are men coming down from the valleys.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:56.051]  There are tall ships flying off the coast And they carry the light in the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind Bring my gun and a handful of silver By the sea we will gather for the fight
[00:01:58.468 --> 00:02:13.955]  It's been so many years So many tears We have lost once before Now we'll settle the score When our cannons will roar Revolution!
[00:02:34.618 --> 00:02:35.739]  We're good to go.
[00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.028]  Let us marvel and parole at the rocky hills tonight Under cover of the darkness we will
[00:03:38.095 --> 00:03:42.597]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:03:44.397 --> 00:03:52.941]  It is the ninth day of July, 2007 and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:03:54.561 --> 00:04:00.704]  And let me just mention some of the important news that we have here on the stack today, a very important broadcast for you today.
[00:04:00.784 --> 00:04:04.365]  Headline, Al-Qaeda threatens war against Iran.
[00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:09.032]  That's the mainstream news today, and of course a flashback to a story we put out on May 28th.
[00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:09.933]  U.S.
[00:04:10.073 --> 00:04:12.954]  government uses Al-Qaeda to attack Iran.
[00:04:12.994 --> 00:04:17.175]  This is big news, and we'll be going over it coming up later in the broadcast.
[00:04:17.696 --> 00:04:28.960]  Also, Congressman Ron Paul's appearance with George Stephanopoulos on one of the biggest Sunday news shows in the country this week with George Stephanopoulos.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.661]  We'll be playing that and analyzing it and commenting on the spin.
[00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:34.428]  Or came out there.
[00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.530]  Live Earth branded a foul-mouthed flop.
[00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:42.174]  Top global warming advocate said Jupiter, Saturn, closer to Sun than Earth.
[00:04:42.655 --> 00:04:45.517]  Big story out on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:45.898 --> 00:04:48.140]  Woman arrested for not watering lawn.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.602]  Also brutalized by police, they say.
[00:04:50.942 --> 00:04:51.803]  The new policy.
[00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:53.865]  Actually physically assaulted.
[00:04:55.266 --> 00:05:01.151]  And one of our people out there, Bet Shalom Ministries, arrested in Terre Haute.
[00:05:04.745 --> 00:05:07.909]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.192]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.553 --> 00:05:18.183]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.897 --> 00:05:25.938]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.338 --> 00:05:37.800]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.521]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.001]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.301 --> 00:05:48.142]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:02.387 --> 00:06:11.454]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as Triamethylenes, Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and MTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.694 --> 00:06:22.922]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:23.263 --> 00:06:28.967]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:29.207 --> 00:06:35.876]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:36.096 --> 00:06:42.925]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:43.185 --> 00:06:44.948]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[00:06:45.208 --> 00:06:47.291]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.

[00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:04.155]  Do you know that you can go solar for under $1,200 now?
[00:07:04.675 --> 00:07:05.795]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[00:07:05.995 --> 00:07:10.116]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.624]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[00:07:16.145 --> 00:07:22.570]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more!
[00:07:23.308 --> 00:07:26.010]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:36.137]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[00:07:36.417 --> 00:07:40.120]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:46.664]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[00:07:46.844 --> 00:07:47.885]  Are you ready to go solar?
[00:07:48.085 --> 00:07:49.046]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.

[00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.453]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.473 --> 00:08:07.794]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:41.028]  You know the two lay pastors that have been traveling just through three or four states so far, starting in Colorado trying to get to DC to protest the war and 9-11.
[00:08:42.475 --> 00:08:44.096]  They just have little signs.
[00:08:44.136 --> 00:08:45.257]  They're very polite to police.
[00:08:45.277 --> 00:08:46.118]  They've been detained.
[00:08:46.498 --> 00:08:52.083]  They've had CPS called on them because their family comes out every few days during the summer in an RV and visits.
[00:08:52.603 --> 00:08:54.205]  Their seven-year-old son was taken.
[00:08:55.426 --> 00:08:57.147]  They continued their walk.
[00:08:57.207 --> 00:09:00.510]  His wife stayed behind there in Kansas where they kidnapped his son.
[00:09:01.483 --> 00:09:10.690]  And now they had gotten in Indiana and were in Terre Houte, the big federal execution center, where the local police are basically feds, and they arrested them.
[00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.451]  And they've charged them.
[00:09:13.693 --> 00:09:21.955]  And they have charged them with failure to ID because when police walk up and say, I want to see your ID or you're not allowed to stand here on the street corner.
[00:09:21.975 --> 00:09:34.137]  Well, we played clips from Illinois and Colorado and all over the country where cops run up with guns and plain clothes and guns in their belts and mustard stains on their chest screaming at them.
[00:09:34.177 --> 00:09:36.738]  I mean, this is just this is the new America, folks.
[00:09:37.278 --> 00:09:39.558]  Now, if you're an illegal alien, they've all been told, leave you alone.
[00:09:39.578 --> 00:09:42.499]  And I actually have that in the news today, which just illustrates
[00:09:43.135 --> 00:09:44.716]  Now, that this is selectively enforced.
[00:09:44.756 --> 00:09:47.878]  If they see an American, black, white, Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[00:09:47.918 --> 00:09:50.700]  If they know you're an American, they go, this is a cattle.
[00:09:51.261 --> 00:09:52.421]  This is one of the dumb ones.
[00:09:52.461 --> 00:09:55.023]  This is one of the people I'm allowed to feed on.
[00:09:55.043 --> 00:09:58.145]  Okay, this is one of the ones I'm allowed to push around.
[00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:05.470]  Any real criminality going on anywhere, though, they're told to just back off and leave them alone.
[00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:06.831]  That's the end of the deal.
[00:10:08.604 --> 00:10:10.265]  In fact, let me just get into the police state news.
[00:10:10.285 --> 00:10:15.727]  I don't get into the international news, the carbon tax news, which they're now announcing.
[00:10:15.787 --> 00:10:17.548]  Energy chairman floats carbon tax.
[00:10:17.888 --> 00:10:21.790]  They're going to be announcing that today, trying to introduce that in the House and Senate.
[00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.392]  New Jersey governor passes the toughest carbon tax law in the country.
[00:10:27.672 --> 00:10:28.653]  This is from Reuters.
[00:10:30.117 --> 00:10:32.298]  Live Earth, of course, is a complete flop.
[00:10:32.418 --> 00:10:33.598]  We'll be getting into all of that.
[00:10:33.638 --> 00:10:38.399]  Also, Al-Qaeda threatens war against Iran, which we told you about over a month ago.
[00:10:38.419 --> 00:10:39.859]  This is from May 28.
[00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:40.559]  The U.S.
[00:10:40.579 --> 00:10:42.560]  government uses Al-Qaeda to attack Iran.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.760]  It's now mainstream news.
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.741]  We'll be going over that.
[00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:46.781]  Of course, they're assets.
[00:10:46.961 --> 00:10:48.461]  Of course, Al-Qaeda is going to be attacking.
[00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:53.722]  They always attack the New World Order's enemies, whether it's the Serbs, the Iranians, it doesn't matter.
[00:10:53.762 --> 00:10:55.583]  They openly work for the globalists.
[00:10:55.623 --> 00:10:56.063]  There's no
[00:10:56.929 --> 00:10:57.630]  Even debate about it.
[00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.692]  But you've got a general public who doesn't know the difference between a Shiite or a Sunni.
[00:11:01.192 --> 00:11:04.615]  You've got a general public that doesn't know anything, so the Globals talk to you like you're three-year-olds.
[00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:11.721]  So we're going to be going over all of that coming up here.
[00:11:12.581 --> 00:11:18.906]  Before I get into what happened to Beit Shalom Ministries, this is literally the type of story I see every day.
[00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:25.932]  And there are a lot of people who deny that we're living in a police state.
[00:11:27.532 --> 00:11:31.613]  Well, when New York tries to ban videotaping the cops, you're living in a police state.
[00:11:31.653 --> 00:11:44.078]  In fact, I watched a video over the weekend where you see some people pull a camera out, and they start videotaping across the street, and you see police stomping on someone who's in handcuffs on the ground.
[00:11:44.818 --> 00:11:51.840]  And you see from about 60 feet away, clear as day, on the YouTube video, the police applying enough force to kill somebody.
[00:11:52.321 --> 00:11:56.242]  Believe me, folks, you start stomping somebody, people start dying real fast.
[00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.512]  People started going into comas real fast.
[00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.775]  And they are stomping him.
[00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:02.296]  Not just kicking.
[00:12:02.336 --> 00:12:08.984]  There is a direct right foot stomp directly to what appears to be the neck, head, and body area.
[00:12:10.342 --> 00:12:11.183]  Stop, stop, stop!
[00:12:11.643 --> 00:12:26.193]  Cops run over, they assault the camera guy, they start screaming, then by then another camera comes out and you see the police assaulting and with clenched fists, ramming their fists into the camera person saying, come on, and we can't really play it if there's so much cussing.
[00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:30.036]  The cops are cussing with pleasure, looks just like gang members in uniforms.
[00:12:30.636 --> 00:12:31.597]  Punching the person!
[00:12:31.657 --> 00:12:32.057]  Punching!
[00:12:32.117 --> 00:12:32.517]  Punching!
[00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:35.699]  Saying, come on, bitch, come on, bitch, with a bunch of other stuff.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.601]  And the camera people are backing off, going, hey, what are you doing this for?
[00:12:38.641 --> 00:12:39.462]  Hey, why are you doing that?
[00:12:39.802 --> 00:12:40.142]  Stop!
[00:12:40.202 --> 00:12:40.482]  Stop!
[00:12:41.103 --> 00:12:42.023]  The cops go, that's it!
[00:12:42.083 --> 00:12:42.544]  Arresting!
[00:12:42.584 --> 00:12:44.485]  They take him, slam his head in the wall.
[00:12:44.785 --> 00:12:46.526]  They're going, oh yeah!
[00:12:46.806 --> 00:12:48.708]  Look who's in command now!
[00:12:49.048 --> 00:12:52.070]  I mean, you wanna live in Nazi Germany, folks, you're gonna live in it!
[00:12:53.371 --> 00:12:56.513]  You wanna be shoved around and treated like a slave, it's gonna happen!
[00:12:57.693 --> 00:12:58.714]  It's gonna happen everywhere!
[00:12:59.409 --> 00:13:00.009]  You're gonna learn.
[00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.172]  Doesn't matter how much money you got or how fancy your car is.
[00:13:03.212 --> 00:13:06.394]  They're getting all the old cops that aren't psychopaths off the force.
[00:13:06.774 --> 00:13:08.795]  They're not promoting the people that are normal.
[00:13:09.096 --> 00:13:12.158]  They're, they're, they're, they're promoting the shaved head roid heads.
[00:13:13.198 --> 00:13:15.840]  And who they got their black power or their Nazi tattoos.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.301]  They don't care as long as they're extremists.
[00:13:17.722 --> 00:13:19.083]  And they're gonna be running things now.
[00:13:19.723 --> 00:13:20.423]  You understand that?
[00:13:21.564 --> 00:13:21.864]  Good.
[00:13:22.005 --> 00:13:22.465]  Glad you do.
[00:13:23.661 --> 00:13:26.582]  And then I went and said, you know, let me just type police brutality into YouTube.
[00:13:26.602 --> 00:13:28.102]  And there were hundreds of links, new ones.
[00:13:28.502 --> 00:13:36.204]  I mean, just where there'd be an old lady and they'd haul off and slug them in the face, or they'd stomp an old man down, or they'd kick some woman in the gut and laugh.
[00:13:36.304 --> 00:13:38.844]  I mean, and then now they're getting where they just do it right on tape.
[00:13:38.864 --> 00:13:40.424]  They're just like, yeah, watch this!
[00:13:40.884 --> 00:13:42.825]  Bam, baby, yeah, all right!
[00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:44.945]  You live in your little celebration dances.
[00:13:45.565 --> 00:13:48.506]  I mean, it's getting right down to Clockwork Orange level.
[00:13:51.319 --> 00:13:54.783]  Now, these are the type of stories I see every single day.
[00:13:54.883 --> 00:13:57.526]  And you don't even usually cover them because it's become so passe.
[00:13:58.987 --> 00:14:02.411]  Woman arrested for not watering lawn.
[00:14:02.931 --> 00:14:06.415]  But that's not the news here out of KSL.com.
[00:14:08.577 --> 00:14:09.357]  That's not the news.
[00:14:09.397 --> 00:14:11.440]  The news is they assaulted her.
[00:14:13.962 --> 00:14:14.763]  They assaulted her.
[00:14:16.199 --> 00:14:26.287]  And I see this in cases all the time where the cops will say, well, she assaulted us, she forced us to tackle her, and then that hurt when I tackled her, I'm charging her with assault.
[00:14:27.268 --> 00:14:36.635]  In the Christopher Bolin case, that was in the mainstream newspapers, the former American Free Press writer, and I was sitting there reading the articles, it was the police saying it!
[00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:39.297]  I mean, it's not like it's my opinion, the cops were saying it!
[00:14:40.362 --> 00:14:49.886]  They were saying, well, he called the police department saying there were weird men driving around the neighborhood that looked like gang members.
[00:14:50.446 --> 00:14:52.767]  And then the cops come up and say, yeah, it's us.
[00:14:53.487 --> 00:14:54.728]  And they admit they started yelling at him.
[00:14:54.768 --> 00:14:55.968]  He says, I'm going in my house.
[00:14:56.808 --> 00:15:03.251]  He turns around, they tackle him, and then they charge him with assaulting them, saying, well, we tackled him.
[00:15:04.351 --> 00:15:06.352]  And then he was convicted of assault.
[00:15:06.952 --> 00:15:08.353]  And then they say, because we tackled him.
[00:15:09.272 --> 00:15:14.776]  You see, we've entered a wonderland now of this, and that's what happened to this woman.
[00:15:18.298 --> 00:15:26.544]  It says, a widow and grandma spent the morning in jail, arrested for refusing to give a policeman her name, when he tried writing her a ticket for failing to water her yard.
[00:15:26.704 --> 00:15:30.027]  Now, it goes on to say he assaulted her, but that's okay!
[00:15:30.827 --> 00:15:31.868]  That's what all women are for!
[00:15:32.617 --> 00:15:54.512]  I mean, I've got footage in my film, Police State Do The Takeover, where the cops went nuts in Seattle and went into the neighborhoods, and I'm talking 75-year-old women, folks, where they're stomping on them with full force, just going, and you hear them grunting, going, I mean, just full power, breaking collarbones, breaking arms, with women just begging, going, no, please!
[00:15:55.172 --> 00:16:01.477]  I mean, people just walk out of shops, and the cops just go, with billy clubs, I mean, just putting force into it.
[00:16:02.398 --> 00:16:08.420]  I mean, like it's a man, you know, like you're a man charging another 200-pound man with full force in combat and battle.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:15.723]  But it's not, it's an old woman, and she's just like... And the woman... Yes!
[00:16:15.943 --> 00:16:17.244]  Death to America!
[00:16:17.364 --> 00:16:18.784]  The evil is marching!
[00:16:18.944 --> 00:16:20.345]  The power is rising!
[00:16:20.365 --> 00:16:21.625]  Death to freedom!
[00:16:21.845 --> 00:16:23.206]  Death to America!
[00:16:23.406 --> 00:16:24.566]  Yes, yes, yes!
[00:16:25.006 --> 00:16:26.307]  I mean, this is what we've turned into.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.600]  I'm on steroids!
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.641]  I'm a big wimp!
[00:16:30.001 --> 00:16:31.561]  I was a bully in school!
[00:16:31.662 --> 00:16:32.642]  Now I'm a cop!
[00:16:32.902 --> 00:16:35.103]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[00:16:35.363 --> 00:16:36.723]  Death to America!
[00:16:37.123 --> 00:16:38.524]  I mean, that's literally what we're facing.
[00:16:39.764 --> 00:16:47.827]  A widow and grandma spent the morning in jail, arrested for refusing to give a policeman her name when he tried writing her a ticket for failing to water her yard.
[00:16:47.867 --> 00:16:50.688]  Now, she was at her front door, and she just went back in her house.
[00:16:50.708 --> 00:16:52.049]  Oh, you don't do that to God.
[00:16:53.194 --> 00:16:59.560]  The woman hasn't watered her lawn in more than a year, and the conditioner yard violates the ORM zoning ordinance.
[00:17:00.481 --> 00:17:07.687]  It goes on, she's lived there for a long time, and she doesn't have the money to water it, and it's brown grass, dead grass, she's not allowed.
[00:17:07.707 --> 00:17:18.998]  I remember the cops were arresting Roland Ellingson, veteran, old retired arborist, dying, he was really sick with cancer, and he had colon cancer, and they came to his house,
[00:17:20.467 --> 00:17:23.428]  While he was on chemotherapy and they arrested him, he had three inch grass.
[00:17:23.649 --> 00:17:24.569]  They wanted the property.
[00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:30.032]  It was worth 500 grand off of 27th Street over there, right off Guadalupe.
[00:17:30.212 --> 00:17:33.313]  Premium, premium, premium property.
[00:17:35.994 --> 00:17:37.375]  Death to America!
[00:17:37.415 --> 00:17:38.656]  Yeah, yeah, yeah!
[00:17:38.676 --> 00:17:40.317]  I mean, that's what it's all about.
[00:17:40.337 --> 00:17:41.877]  Death to America!
[00:17:41.937 --> 00:17:43.198]  They love it so much!
[00:17:43.378 --> 00:17:44.479]  It's so much fun!
[00:17:44.759 --> 00:17:45.719]  Yeah, yeah, yeah!
[00:17:45.739 --> 00:17:47.220]  Alright, continuing here.
[00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:55.371]  Tonight, the woman says she is traumatized and shocked that she was hauled to jail just because she says she can't afford to water her lawn.
[00:17:56.031 --> 00:18:01.053]  Betty Perry says, I never thought they would ever do anything like this to a person that is 70 years old.
[00:18:01.273 --> 00:18:03.033]  They're going to euthanize you soon, lady.
[00:18:03.773 --> 00:18:05.694]  You didn't get the word that they run everything?
[00:18:06.334 --> 00:18:07.654]  I've never bothered anybody.
[00:18:07.694 --> 00:18:08.794]  I've never hurt anyone.
[00:18:09.374 --> 00:18:12.035]  Oh, well, that's exactly why you're targeted, my dear.
[00:18:12.775 --> 00:18:18.079]  She says the policeman who brought her home tonight was very courteous, even held open the door for her.
[00:18:18.119 --> 00:18:19.780]  Yeah, because that's got a little humanity left.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.002]  He isn't a, DEATH TO AMERICA!
[00:18:22.422 --> 00:18:23.843]  But see, it gets worse as you read deeper.
[00:18:24.323 --> 00:18:29.347]  But there were no gentlemen there when she was taken from her home this morning and booked into jail.
[00:18:29.947 --> 00:18:36.112]  When Betty Perry heard a knock on the door and saw a police officer standing outside, she never imagined she would end up in jail.
[00:18:36.512 --> 00:18:39.154]  That's what happened though, and I guarantee you they did a search of her house, folks.
[00:18:39.756 --> 00:18:45.239]  That's what happened though when the officer tried enforcing Orm's nuisance ordinance against neglected yards.
[00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:47.640]  It shows her yards, it's just grass.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.042]  I didn't want to tell him anything until I talked to a lawyer.
[00:18:52.082 --> 00:18:54.623]  My son, I wanted to see what he'd tell me to do.
[00:18:55.003 --> 00:18:58.064]  I never had any experience before with a lawn ever in my life, she said.
[00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:03.587]  As the enforcement officer started riding her, it's a rural area by the way, see now they're doing it in the counties.
[00:19:04.887 --> 00:19:08.389]  As the enforcement officer, I'm an enforcement, I'm an official,
[00:19:09.142 --> 00:19:10.343]  Started writing her the ticket.
[00:19:10.383 --> 00:19:12.445]  She tried going back into her house.
[00:19:13.006 --> 00:19:18.111]  That's when the officer tried to handcuff her for refusing to give her name and resisting the ticket.
[00:19:18.431 --> 00:19:21.094]  I mean, as if he doesn't know he's at her house.
[00:19:22.896 --> 00:19:25.117]  It says that she tripped on the steps.
[00:19:25.177 --> 00:19:27.498]  Notice how they spin it, but you read deeper.
[00:19:27.798 --> 00:19:28.658]  They've tackled her.
[00:19:28.718 --> 00:19:29.418]  He just grabbed her.
[00:19:30.099 --> 00:19:31.519]  She tripped and hurt herself.
[00:19:31.659 --> 00:19:32.359]  See how they spin it?
[00:19:32.859 --> 00:19:35.860]  She tripped on the steps, scraping her nose and elbows.
[00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:36.941]  Oh!
[00:19:37.381 --> 00:19:40.702]  Leaving blood on her door, her porch, and clothes.
[00:19:41.562 --> 00:19:44.103]  Perry was handcuffed, fingerprinted, and put in the jail cell.
[00:19:44.123 --> 00:19:45.764]  Isn't that some delicate spin?
[00:19:45.804 --> 00:19:47.044]  It says he grabbed her and handcuffed her.
[00:19:47.925 --> 00:19:49.185]  She fell on her face.
[00:19:49.225 --> 00:19:51.586]  You know how they do when they jump with their knees on your head.
[00:19:52.563 --> 00:19:54.304]  Death to America!
[00:19:54.384 --> 00:19:55.524]  Death to the freedom!
[00:19:55.724 --> 00:19:56.964]  Hell is released!
[00:19:57.144 --> 00:19:58.185]  Hail the police!
[00:19:58.425 --> 00:20:00.265]  Hail, hail, hail, hail, hail!
[00:20:02.866 --> 00:20:04.947]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.567 --> 00:20:14.490]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:22.132]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.862 --> 00:20:28.368]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.848 --> 00:20:39.679]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.442]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.982 --> 00:20:45.783]  For more information call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:20:45.823 --> 00:20:46.163]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:21:01.809 --> 00:21:02.790]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:07.632]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:07.812 --> 00:21:15.617]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:15.877 --> 00:21:21.260]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:28.444]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:28.744 --> 00:21:34.071]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:21:34.332 --> 00:21:39.058]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:21:39.418 --> 00:21:47.008]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:21:47.348 --> 00:21:53.591]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:53.891 --> 00:21:55.031]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:55.071 --> 00:21:55.272]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.465 --> 00:22:06.691]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:22:06.831 --> 00:22:14.940]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:21.988]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:22:23.169 --> 00:22:29.674]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:22:29.854 --> 00:22:34.957]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:22:35.058 --> 00:22:43.944]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[00:22:44.204 --> 00:22:47.507]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:22:49.608 --> 00:22:49.928]  We're good.
[00:23:01.064 --> 00:23:06.029]  Hello, I'm Dr. Bill Diegel of the Nutri-Medical Report here on Genesis After Alex Jones 2-4 Monday to Friday.
[00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:14.617]  We developed the first line of defense kit to block pathogenic infective organisms to give you day-to-day protection as well as infection protection against biological and chemical weapons.
[00:23:14.717 --> 00:23:17.800]  Defense tabs block virus and bacterial entry into your tissues.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.162]  Immunity blocks the tissues by improving
[00:23:20.182 --> 00:23:20.622]  We're good to go!
[00:23:48.444 --> 00:23:52.086]  They're reeling against the crowd Another ragtag band Declaring
[00:24:19.357 --> 00:24:21.839]  This is the most pathetic thing I've ever read, this poor lady.
[00:24:25.281 --> 00:24:30.104]  So the cop tackles her, busks her nose, there's blood everywhere, busks her hands up and takes her to jail.
[00:24:30.124 --> 00:24:35.207]  Perry was handcuffed, fingerprinted and put in a jail cell where she sat for more than an hour.
[00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:38.369]  I laid down in there, I'd never seen the inside of a jail before.
[00:24:40.715 --> 00:24:41.896]  I didn't know how it looked.
[00:24:41.956 --> 00:24:42.936]  I was really scared.
[00:24:43.076 --> 00:24:45.177]  This is a 70 plus year old grandmother, she says.
[00:24:45.638 --> 00:24:49.200]  When the police brass learned what happened, she was immediately released.
[00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:57.504]  Let's see, it'll be the young people that'll soon, the next generation that watches 24 and thinks old ladies are Al Qaeda, it'll be the police chief soon.
[00:24:58.665 --> 00:25:01.066]  When police brass learned what happened, she was immediately released.
[00:25:01.793 --> 00:25:12.158]  Or in police spokesman Lieutenant Doug Edwards said, every officer in his career has situations where they find themselves getting into at the end of it and they scratch their head and say, gosh, how did this happen?
[00:25:12.198 --> 00:25:14.079]  Today, I think, was one of those days.
[00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:16.880]  Clearly, there was some other options available.
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:24.244]  So they haven't purely bred the instinct out of these men yet, or at least out of the higher level people, that assaulting old ladies is not good.
[00:25:25.297 --> 00:25:26.457]  There's several articles on this.
[00:25:26.477 --> 00:25:27.918]  I mean, they tore the living hell out of her.
[00:25:28.038 --> 00:25:31.419]  Bloody nose, bloody face, bloody lips, bloody hands.
[00:25:31.439 --> 00:25:33.399]  I mean, you know, they slammed her face in the concrete.
[00:25:33.779 --> 00:25:35.660]  You're gonna learn to comply!
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.861]  Okay, let me just contest.
[00:25:38.881 --> 00:25:39.661]  That's the noise they make.
[00:25:39.681 --> 00:25:40.541]  That's why I make that noise.
[00:25:41.001 --> 00:25:43.942]  After being arrested, Perry is now scared of the police.
[00:25:44.482 --> 00:25:46.163]  That's why the feds have given him this training, lady.
[00:25:46.183 --> 00:25:46.663]  You're meant to be.
[00:25:46.943 --> 00:25:51.344]  She says, don't ever say no when the police tell you to do something.
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:55.302]  Including getting in that special van going to the train facility?
[00:25:55.362 --> 00:25:55.763]  No.
[00:25:56.103 --> 00:25:56.743]  Let me go back to her.
[00:25:56.984 --> 00:25:59.365]  Don't ever say no when the police tell you to do something.
[00:25:59.946 --> 00:26:05.930]  You better do what they tell you no matter what, even if you don't have anybody to help you, she said.
[00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:09.612]  You've got to do what they tell you or they will hurt you.
[00:26:09.632 --> 00:26:20.120]  And I know I should support the cops in Seattle when I have them on tape stomping old women, stomping people walking out of restaurants, and the cops just go,
[00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:24.230]  Yeah!
[00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:24.870]  High fives!
[00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:25.631]  Whoa!
[00:26:25.651 --> 00:26:26.751]  Did you see me do that?
[00:26:26.771 --> 00:26:47.862]  I mean, that's why when I read the London Independent back in 2003, just a few months into the invasion, they'd now stabilized things, and it was outside Basra, and it was Marines, and there's just a woman walking with her three-year-old in her hand, you know, holding her hand, and they shoot her with a .50 cal in the head, and they make a joke, and they make a bet.
[00:26:48.242 --> 00:26:49.903]  You think I can blow this bitch's head off?
[00:26:50.746 --> 00:26:55.070]  It was several thousand yards away and they made their bet and he shot it and the head blew right off.
[00:26:55.851 --> 00:27:03.958]  This is in front of a reporter and it was described by the reporter how the child stood there with their mother's hand still in its hand.
[00:27:08.757 --> 00:27:10.138]  See, that's the spirit.
[00:27:10.459 --> 00:27:16.645]  And by the way, the tanks, the photos, the video of the skulls, 666 on them, the death metal music.
[00:27:16.665 --> 00:27:22.130]  Can you imagine these Arabs watching Abrams tanks rolling around with... I mean, that's the music!
[00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:23.912]  We ought to go download some death metal.
[00:27:23.932 --> 00:27:24.293]  Maybe some...
[00:27:32.814 --> 00:27:35.756]  Oh, what's that German band that has that song called Rammstein?
[00:27:35.977 --> 00:27:38.538]  I've actually seen that on the news, a tank rolling by playing Rammstein.
[00:27:38.558 --> 00:27:39.079]  What's the name of that?
[00:27:39.899 --> 00:27:41.741]  Maybe the name... is the group called Rammstein?
[00:27:42.521 --> 00:27:43.842]  Rammstein!
[00:27:44.083 --> 00:27:46.725]  In fact, let's just get... let's hear the Christian Army!
[00:27:47.325 --> 00:27:50.307]  Let's get... let's download some Rammstein!
[00:27:50.327 --> 00:27:53.129]  And let's play some Rammstein!
[00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.852]  Because, you know, Arnold wears Nazi belt buckles on the cover of Time Magazine.
[00:27:56.932 --> 00:28:00.215]  No, no, we're not in a police state, America!
[00:28:02.017 --> 00:28:04.958]  We're not in a police state, America.
[00:28:07.279 --> 00:28:15.303]  No, no, we should just support whatever the cops do, so that the last few good cops are forced out around the country, and so the scum can take over.
[00:28:15.523 --> 00:28:17.324]  That's how you support the police.
[00:28:17.364 --> 00:28:18.224]  And you support the troops?
[00:28:18.464 --> 00:28:21.866]  By mindlessly agreeing to whatever the government says, and just shutting your mouth.
[00:28:23.066 --> 00:28:24.487]  Like she said, do whatever they say.
[00:28:25.865 --> 00:28:26.165]  Really?
[00:28:26.185 --> 00:28:36.229]  Because all over the country, including Austin, Texas, they come to your door and knock on it and say, and it's always the middle of the day, they already cased the house, they already know your husband's working, it's always women, do they think you're stupid?
[00:28:36.889 --> 00:28:37.849]  And they know you'll comply.
[00:28:37.869 --> 00:28:40.730]  You may not be dumb, but they know statistically you comply.
[00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.751]  And they say, hi, have we gotten some reports?
[00:28:42.811 --> 00:28:44.352]  Mind if we do a cursory search of the house?
[00:28:44.392 --> 00:28:45.152]  Got any firearms?
[00:28:45.712 --> 00:28:46.512]  Do you use drugs?
[00:28:48.793 --> 00:28:50.914]  And of course most people go, well no, go ahead and search.
[00:28:52.199 --> 00:28:53.180]  I mean, that's America.
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:57.542]  From Dallas to Phoenix to New York to Seattle.
[00:28:58.723 --> 00:29:04.226]  I mean, when I say that the majority of bars in certain districts of Seattle are owned by the cops, it's because it's true.
[00:29:04.266 --> 00:29:06.747]  They have actually, as a mafia, taken over.
[00:29:07.147 --> 00:29:09.629]  They will have a cop sell another cop cocaine in the bathroom.
[00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.929]  Boom!
[00:29:10.249 --> 00:29:11.990]  Acid forfeiture, seizure, no trial, no nothing.
[00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:17.053]  And they're so corrupt now, they actually hand the bars over to themselves publicly.
[00:29:18.374 --> 00:29:21.916]  I mean, we're reaching Mexico-level corruption.
[00:29:22.517 --> 00:29:22.857]  Okay?
[00:29:23.257 --> 00:29:25.739]  North Korea-level corruption.
[00:29:25.939 --> 00:29:33.744]  But like she says, I guess when the cop comes to your door and wants to search it without a warrant, you've got to do what they tell you or they will hurt you.
[00:29:36.505 --> 00:29:40.528]  The officer was sent to the home for the day and placed on paid administrative leave.
[00:29:40.848 --> 00:29:45.711]  Police are not pressing any charges against Betty Perry for either neglecting her yard or resisting the ticket.
[00:29:46.545 --> 00:29:48.609]  Now that's because you've got a half-decent police chief.
[00:29:48.949 --> 00:29:50.792]  That police officer needs to be fired!
[00:29:51.814 --> 00:29:52.716]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.217 --> 00:29:54.819]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.839 --> 00:29:58.425]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.809 --> 00:30:04.530]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:07.251]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[00:30:07.551 --> 00:30:10.632]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[00:30:11.132 --> 00:30:13.272]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[00:30:13.432 --> 00:30:14.833]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[00:30:15.093 --> 00:30:19.194]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[00:30:19.534 --> 00:30:22.655]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[00:30:22.955 --> 00:30:24.176]  With more than 500 vital functions.
[00:30:25.416 --> 00:30:33.684]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.
[00:30:34.044 --> 00:30:36.747]  And it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.
[00:30:37.107 --> 00:30:44.414]  LIV52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol, and prescription medications.
[00:30:44.774 --> 00:30:51.876]  To order Live52 and for the best source of researched herbal products, visit research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482.
[00:30:52.616 --> 00:30:56.937]  That's research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482.
[00:30:56.957 --> 00:31:01.038]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:02.098 --> 00:31:05.019]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:31:05.079 --> 00:31:10.840]  Did you know that the mother of all secret societies, the Illuminati, worships Lucifer, better known as Satan the Devil?
[00:31:11.847 --> 00:31:18.592]  Did you know that they are the individuals giving rise to the final world social system described in Revelation Chapter 13?
[00:31:20.113 --> 00:31:24.796]  Did you know they were the founders of international communism to be the seen enemy of Christianity?
[00:31:24.816 --> 00:31:30.760]  To be used to destroy America so that we could be merged into an all-powerful one-world government?
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:39.946]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:31:40.846 --> 00:31:42.288]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.

[00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:44.130]  Call now.
[00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.113]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:02.810]  Attention!
[00:32:02.911 --> 00:32:05.733]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[00:32:06.033 --> 00:32:10.336]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:32:10.656 --> 00:32:11.337]  Listen closely.
[00:32:11.977 --> 00:32:19.443]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[00:32:19.743 --> 00:32:28.510]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:31.772]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country,
[00:32:31.992 --> 00:32:34.313]  No health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[00:32:34.613 --> 00:32:44.076]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[00:32:44.276 --> 00:32:49.918]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[00:32:50.098 --> 00:32:53.680]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.221]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[00:33:06.158 --> 00:33:09.961]  Riders on the storm.
[00:33:10.781 --> 00:33:14.204]  Riders on the storm.
[00:33:15.185 --> 00:33:19.689]  Into this house we're born.
[00:33:19.869 --> 00:33:23.171]  Into this world we're thrown.
[00:33:24.152 --> 00:33:28.736]  Like a dog without a bone and packer out of roam.
[00:33:29.496 --> 00:33:30.998]  Riders on the storm.
[00:33:33.599 --> 00:33:59.611]  There's a killer on the road His brain is squirming like a toad JK Long Holiday Let your children play If you give this man a ride Sweet Emily will die Killer on the road
[00:34:03.272 --> 00:34:06.296]  Squirming like a toad.
[00:34:06.316 --> 00:34:17.868]  I have a New York Times article where they're calling it a grid, a control grid of cameras, London style, to control and watch everything you do, but you're going to be banned from videotaping the cops.
[00:34:17.888 --> 00:34:22.033]  By the way, I've seen them arrest people saying there's a law they can't videotape when there wasn't one.
[00:34:22.693 --> 00:34:23.074]  Now they've
[00:34:24.002 --> 00:34:27.583]  Not even passing one, they just say, oh, we have a new policy, you can't videotape us.
[00:34:28.143 --> 00:34:29.184]  We are gods.
[00:34:30.464 --> 00:34:32.665]  Because they were arresting people for it, and they've been losing in courts.
[00:34:32.705 --> 00:34:35.126]  They just say, hey, you know what, though?
[00:34:35.146 --> 00:34:36.566]  We'll just make it illegal.
[00:34:37.687 --> 00:34:42.348]  Just like when they walk up to Luke Rudowsky and others and go, I think you got a bomb in your bag.
[00:34:42.388 --> 00:34:47.490]  I know you don't have one, but we're going to say you do, and you're going to spend 30 days in the hole.
[00:34:54.483 --> 00:34:56.064]  Now again, folks, this is tyranny.
[00:34:56.084 --> 00:34:57.384]  This is how most countries run.
[00:34:57.804 --> 00:35:00.925]  And if you want to live in a third-world cesspit, you're going to get to.
[00:35:00.945 --> 00:35:04.107]  Coming up in about seven minutes, we're going to get Bay Shalom Ministries on.
[00:35:04.307 --> 00:35:06.427]  They got arrested in Terre Haute, Indiana.
[00:35:07.008 --> 00:35:09.228]  Can't walk across America with an anti-war sign, folks.
[00:35:09.248 --> 00:35:11.329]  They get detained, stopped, arrested.
[00:35:11.809 --> 00:35:14.750]  They call back and they have their children's CPS back home.
[00:35:15.631 --> 00:35:16.951]  I mean, they've been through a lot.
[00:35:17.291 --> 00:35:18.312]  And this is the freedom!
[00:35:19.012 --> 00:35:21.213]  Well, America ain't no police state!
[00:35:22.217 --> 00:35:30.965]  Oh, and by the way, dovetailing with all of this, Bloomberg News, speaking of Bloomberg, who's banning videotaping the police and anybody else, U.S.
[00:35:31.045 --> 00:35:34.469]  unable to deport most illegal immigrants who commit crimes.
[00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.751]  U.S.
[00:35:37.331 --> 00:35:39.914]  unable to deport most illegal aliens who commit crimes.
[00:35:40.614 --> 00:35:47.741]  Ezekiel Lopez already had a rap sheet that stretched all the way to Texas when police said he shot Kenesha
[00:35:49.739 --> 00:35:54.044]  County, Wisconsin, Deputy Sheriff Frank Fabio in the head, killing him.
[00:35:54.745 --> 00:36:00.031]  Well, they just killed some Dallas cop, a Houston cop, a El Paso cop in the last two weeks, illegals.
[00:36:00.051 --> 00:36:03.355]  I know they've shot a bunch of cops, but it's all kept real quiet.
[00:36:03.375 --> 00:36:08.000]  See, they're only starting to whine and squeal because their precious illegals are killing gods.
[00:36:09.146 --> 00:36:17.608]  Lopez, 45, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, was free at the time of the May shooting after having been jailed for two prior violent crimes.
[00:36:18.248 --> 00:36:23.610]  By law, he should have been deported, but federal immigration authorities didn't know he'd been in custody.
[00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:24.210]  Sure they didn't.
[00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:25.950]  And state and local police didn't tell them.
[00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:26.570]  Sure they didn't.
[00:36:27.191 --> 00:36:33.992]  I have the Houston Chronicle article where it said over 400,000 violent felons released from Houston alone in 2005.
[00:36:34.252 --> 00:36:34.392]  Four
[00:36:37.583 --> 00:36:46.050]  100 plus thousand aggravated felons released in Houston alone.
[00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:46.670]  Why?
[00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:49.592]  Because Houston's really 7 million people metro.
[00:36:50.093 --> 00:36:59.019]  And there, on Houston's own internal census, this has been on the Houston Chronicle, over 2 million illegal aliens in that one shitty alone.
[00:36:59.039 --> 00:37:03.382]  But shh shh shh, we're not supposed to talk about it, it's xenophobic.
[00:37:04.423 --> 00:37:05.724]  It's totally sick!
[00:37:07.099 --> 00:37:09.162]  The country is completely fried!
[00:37:11.466 --> 00:37:12.528]  But this old lady...
[00:37:13.704 --> 00:37:15.945]  She can have the cops come to her door, knock, knock.
[00:37:15.985 --> 00:37:17.245]  You haven't been watering your yard, Rob.
[00:37:17.265 --> 00:37:17.985]  You got a new zone.
[00:37:18.005 --> 00:37:18.825]  We've zoned you in.
[00:37:19.045 --> 00:37:20.686]  You gotta keep it all green and pretty.
[00:37:21.146 --> 00:37:22.586]  She's like, I'm gonna call my lawyer.
[00:37:22.806 --> 00:37:23.967]  Starts turning around to walk up.
[00:37:24.007 --> 00:37:28.048]  The cop grabs her, slams her down, busts her head open, and takes her to jail.
[00:37:28.428 --> 00:37:35.950]  But hardcore felons raping and shooting and rear-ending people and drunk driving everywhere.
[00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:37.430]  By the way, I now have a tape.
[00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:38.010]  I'm so busy.
[00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.911]  I haven't had time.
[00:37:38.931 --> 00:37:39.871]  The lady brought us the tape.
[00:37:41.319 --> 00:37:42.079]  We're good to go.
[00:38:01.292 --> 00:38:06.375]  Oh, but you're gonna... I gotta arrest your employee in your parking lot.
[00:38:06.775 --> 00:38:10.797]  He pulled in here looking a little suspicious, so we pulled in after him.
[00:38:10.877 --> 00:38:13.898]  And I walked right up as he's got him in handcuffs.
[00:38:14.159 --> 00:38:16.780]  And I go, well, we've got a suspended license.
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.821]  I mean, expired license.
[00:38:20.042 --> 00:38:21.142]  And I go, but the illegal aliens.
[00:38:21.182 --> 00:38:23.123]  Yeah, we're really not encouraged to arrest them.
[00:38:23.183 --> 00:38:24.144]  The judge just lets them go.
[00:38:24.484 --> 00:38:25.004]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:38:25.024 --> 00:38:25.825]  We don't like it either.
[00:38:27.225 --> 00:38:28.586]  But we're taking him to jail.
[00:38:30.737 --> 00:38:32.978]  And we're gonna slam this old lady's head in the concrete.
[00:38:33.659 --> 00:38:35.039]  And we're gonna assault reporters.
[00:38:35.099 --> 00:38:35.920]  I watch this video.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:36.940]  I can't play it.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.041]  There's so much police cussing.
[00:38:38.361 --> 00:38:40.302]  And the police are stomping one guy.
[00:38:40.542 --> 00:38:42.263]  People are videotaping it across the street.
[00:38:42.603 --> 00:38:44.744]  Cops run over and are hitting him.
[00:38:44.944 --> 00:38:47.185]  Going, come on, come on, come on.
[00:38:47.926 --> 00:38:48.706]  You gotta love that, man.
[00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:51.848]  You get to sit there and punch somebody over and over again with both fists.
[00:38:53.108 --> 00:38:56.510]  And say, come on, come on, come on.
[00:38:59.156 --> 00:39:00.677]  And then they've got to sit there and take it.
[00:39:00.697 --> 00:39:03.099]  I mean, that's a bully's dream.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:05.981]  That's a bully's dream.
[00:39:06.001 --> 00:39:11.545]  They get to beat people up, and no one can raise a hand, and no one can... Cops don't even care now.
[00:39:12.626 --> 00:39:13.046]  In New York.
[00:39:13.086 --> 00:39:15.708]  I mean, in New York, folks, it is literal mafia.
[00:39:15.748 --> 00:39:16.949]  You have not experienced it.
[00:39:17.329 --> 00:39:19.030]  I mean, just somebody walking up that hates you.
[00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.111]  They're rude to people.
[00:39:20.131 --> 00:39:22.372]  I mean, there's some cops that are nice, but I've got to say it's about 30-40%.
[00:39:25.091 --> 00:39:28.545]  And the rest literally just walk around in these sullen power trips.
[00:39:28.665 --> 00:39:30.352]  I mean, it is scary.
[00:39:31.269 --> 00:39:32.870]  And the uniforms even look old-fashioned.
[00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:37.652]  It's real Nazi-like, and they're just, just, I GOT A PROBLEM, MAN!
[00:39:38.132 --> 00:39:39.513]  I mean, it's just, this is America!
[00:39:39.813 --> 00:39:41.293]  And the government's giving them the message.
[00:39:41.573 --> 00:39:42.734]  Release yourselves.
[00:39:43.054 --> 00:39:44.435]  Release your full hate.
[00:39:44.935 --> 00:39:46.375]  Let them know we're the boss.
[00:39:46.916 --> 00:39:47.776]  Let them know.
[00:39:48.096 --> 00:39:49.477]  We're gonna put cameras up everywhere.
[00:39:49.497 --> 00:39:50.917]  We're gonna watch your children in schools.
[00:39:51.137 --> 00:39:52.418]  We're gonna put them in the bathrooms.
[00:39:52.638 --> 00:39:53.999]  We're gonna track everything you do.
[00:39:54.219 --> 00:39:56.400]  But you don't aim a camera at us.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.381]  Do you understand that scum?
[00:40:00.972 --> 00:40:03.342]  I'm going to shut up because we're getting Bates Alarm on here in a few minutes.
[00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:14.353]  New Millennium Concepts is the American manufacturer of the American Black Berkey System, a new standard in filtration, gravity fed filtration.
[00:40:14.373 --> 00:40:19.395]  They also carry, and are the national distributors, you get wholesale pricing, not just on the black elements made in the U.S.
[00:40:19.655 --> 00:40:24.476]  and stainless steel systems, but also on the British, the original progenitors of this system.
[00:40:24.917 --> 00:40:31.939]  And it's what I use in the office, what I use at home, what I've got in the bathroom, you know, because at night I don't want to go to the kitchen to get a drink of water, got it right there.
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:34.282]  It's an absolutely fabulous system.
[00:40:34.462 --> 00:40:37.424]  I add on the special filters that even cut out the fluoride.
[00:40:38.165 --> 00:40:40.267]  And Debbie, thank you for holding while I've been ranting.
[00:40:40.287 --> 00:40:42.629]  I'm just very upset we're going into Nazi Germany right now.
[00:40:42.909 --> 00:40:50.675]  Well, actually, Alex, I'm glad to hold and listen to you for a minute because, you know, most of the stuff you said happened to somebody in my family.
[00:40:50.695 --> 00:40:52.297]  I mean, both times.
[00:40:52.932 --> 00:41:02.917]  You know, my dad, one time when he was 75 years old, a neighbor said my dad was a terrorist and he got arrested and sat in jail three days until a judge could release him.
[00:41:02.937 --> 00:41:04.617]  Who was a terrorist?
[00:41:05.018 --> 00:41:06.218]  They said my dad was.
[00:41:06.778 --> 00:41:08.359]  And this was before 9-11.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.921]  My dad was an apartment manager in Los Angeles.
[00:41:12.481 --> 00:41:17.785]  And one of his tenants got mad at him, and so he called the police and told my dad was a terrorist.
[00:41:17.866 --> 00:41:21.388]  Can you imagine if you were brown?
[00:41:21.408 --> 00:41:23.650]  I mean, you're white.
[00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:26.472]  Can you imagine what would happen to the brown people?
[00:41:26.492 --> 00:41:27.373]  How bad it is for them?
[00:41:27.653 --> 00:41:34.179]  Yeah, and Daddy sat in jail, and I mean, I called the police department, and they, you know, because my stepmom caught me crying her eyes out.
[00:41:34.819 --> 00:41:45.103]  I called the police and they said, well, we know he's not a terrorist, but we can't release him because the law is anytime someone accuses you of being a terrorist, you're automatically arrested.
[00:41:45.123 --> 00:41:45.963]  Period.
[00:41:46.143 --> 00:41:53.426]  Well, that's just California's been CIA run since the 60s when they set up the SWAT teams and the intel ops and they know what they're doing.
[00:41:53.446 --> 00:41:54.666]  Oh my God.
[00:41:55.407 --> 00:41:57.587]  Debbie, I've known you for years and never knew that happened to your dad.
[00:41:57.607 --> 00:42:00.688]  Well, my son got a ticket for $400 because
[00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:22.023]  He's over 21 now, but when he was at my daughter's in Fort Worth, it was a little suburb of Fort Worth, they didn't know there was a curfew, and he walked across the street and two doors down to go buy a hamburger after curfew, not knowing there was one, and he didn't drive, he was walking.
[00:42:23.764 --> 00:42:24.525]  I don't think so.
[00:42:42.797 --> 00:42:44.519]  Banned adults out after 10.
[00:42:44.739 --> 00:42:45.941]  Oh my gosh.
[00:42:46.161 --> 00:42:47.703]  Oh yeah, and it's a good-sized town.
[00:42:47.723 --> 00:42:48.063]  Crazy.
[00:42:48.464 --> 00:42:51.127]  Anyway, but back to Berkey water filters.
[00:42:51.447 --> 00:42:54.191]  We are all affected by our water, Alex.
[00:42:55.129 --> 00:42:57.550]  And that's something that we need to take control of.
[00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:07.154]  By the way, I want people to type into Google, Debbie, Nazis in Fluoride, because people never believe this, because, you know, movies made fun of it, and Kubrick made fun of it, all part of propaganda.
[00:43:07.634 --> 00:43:12.996]  But I have UT Studies, where they pioneered it in the 20s and 30s, that it was a toxic sedative.
[00:43:13.776 --> 00:43:24.320]  And then, there are Pulitzer Prizes, winning one book on it from World War II, it was Pulitzer Prize winning, several others, with the actual Nazi documents, but people can Google it and find the scans online, just say Nazis in Fluoridation.
[00:43:25.268 --> 00:43:27.529]  I want people to read, so there's no more debating.
[00:43:27.869 --> 00:43:29.309]  The government is criminal.
[00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:30.550]  They're poisoning you.
[00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:31.850]  You must get the filters.
[00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:32.410]  Go ahead, Debbie.
[00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:34.351]  Oh, yes, absolutely.
[00:43:34.751 --> 00:43:38.412]  The government is poisoning you, and fluoride is one of the biggest tricks.
[00:43:38.852 --> 00:43:44.574]  And one of the worst things I've ever seen is on the grocery store shelves.
[00:43:45.034 --> 00:43:49.555]  They have water with a picture of a baby on it with pink labels.
[00:43:49.655 --> 00:43:51.415]  Special fluoride!
[00:43:51.976 --> 00:43:53.076]  Oh, yes, Debbie.
[00:43:53.716 --> 00:44:09.945]  And yet, there was a study, if you go to the, I think it's worldnetdaily.com and you go back about a month or so, there was a thing in there about how they... Even the federal government, because of all these studies, says don't give fluoride to a baby.
[00:44:10.005 --> 00:44:17.009]  To a baby, and be sure not to put it in the baby food when you're mixing baby food, but they're selling fluoride water on the shelves.
[00:44:17.029 --> 00:44:17.850]  Well, it's special.
[00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:20.491]  It says with fluoride and other nutrients.
[00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:21.492]  And it's poison.
[00:44:22.052 --> 00:44:23.694]  No, it's not.
[00:44:23.794 --> 00:44:24.534]  No, it's not.
[00:44:25.015 --> 00:44:26.276]  No, the government's good.
[00:44:26.536 --> 00:44:33.122]  You know, how dare me get up here and try to get people to buy at wholesale prices, high quality, made in America or Britain filters.
[00:44:33.382 --> 00:44:34.483]  I'm so evil.
[00:44:34.503 --> 00:44:38.646]  Like, I've gotten criticized for daring to tell people not to drink their fortified vitamins.
[00:44:42.543 --> 00:44:43.704]  You bad boy!
[00:44:43.724 --> 00:44:49.765]  Listen, you not only have the sports bottles which do 600 plus refills just to make the water safe.
[00:44:49.785 --> 00:44:53.026]  The big units make it clean down to non-detectable levels, purify it.
[00:44:53.766 --> 00:44:58.688]  But you can get a $35 value free with the sports bottle.
[00:44:59.228 --> 00:45:02.709]  The big elements on these great sports bottle systems, I always give them as gifts.
[00:45:03.609 --> 00:45:06.651]  Uh, you've also got a deal where you can get five of them for $99.95.
[00:45:07.092 --> 00:45:08.953]  That is just massively off, folks.
[00:45:08.973 --> 00:45:10.414]  You can't get three filters for that.
[00:45:10.654 --> 00:45:12.075]  You're basically getting two filters free.
[00:45:12.095 --> 00:45:14.537]  Uh, but you've also got two different flashlights.
[00:45:14.557 --> 00:45:16.018]  Or are you guys still offering that?
[00:45:16.258 --> 00:45:19.420]  The two different flashlights, depending on which deal you get one of the flashlights.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:24.203]  Special LED, like $30 plus flashlights free when you get a big Berkey.
[00:45:24.303 --> 00:45:25.204]  Are you offering that, Debbie?
[00:45:25.564 --> 00:45:26.024]  We are.
[00:45:26.064 --> 00:45:27.145]  We're still offering it.
[00:45:27.185 --> 00:45:34.610]  We're fixing to eventually not get the flashlights anymore, but if anybody wants those, they need to call in and get them ordered now.
[00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:36.632]  Especially the headlamp one.
[00:45:36.692 --> 00:45:46.899]  I know, you know, a lot of times you need to have your hands free, and we have a real good headlamp one that straps around your head, and it's got a real good LED light on it with
[00:45:47.799 --> 00:45:50.824]  Yeah, basically you're getting one of the lights you said was $29.95.
[00:46:03.862 --> 00:46:05.123]  And then the other was like $35 something.
[00:46:05.203 --> 00:46:07.945]  You guys are paying like more than half that actual price.
[00:46:08.225 --> 00:46:09.045]  So this is a really good deal.
[00:46:09.065 --> 00:46:11.147]  These are really powerful, nice LED.
[00:46:11.167 --> 00:46:12.768]  I mean these are the high-powered ones.
[00:46:12.828 --> 00:46:14.349]  The ones that just go forever basically.
[00:46:15.009 --> 00:46:18.951]  You can get that when you get the $199 model or the $249 model.
[00:46:19.192 --> 00:46:20.352]  They got a bunch of different Berkeys.
[00:46:20.372 --> 00:46:21.113]  Give Debbie a call.
[00:46:21.133 --> 00:46:26.376]  888-803-4438 or go to Berkeywater.com and tell them which free gift
[00:46:26.816 --> 00:46:27.577]  We're good to go.
[00:46:45.798 --> 00:46:47.240]  Debbie, it is a small world.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.341]  Everyone is learning.
[00:46:48.621 --> 00:46:53.086]  Your son, your father, everyone's getting caught up, but none of us talk to our neighbors.
[00:46:53.146 --> 00:46:54.667]  None of us know the full extent.
[00:46:54.948 --> 00:46:57.791]  Just like in Nazi Germany, or just like in this country with sterilization.
[00:46:58.151 --> 00:47:00.794]  It's going on all around us, but we just don't know about it.
[00:47:01.214 --> 00:47:03.877]  And I'm sorry that I'm freaking out, yelling and screaming here on air, folks.
[00:47:03.917 --> 00:47:04.878]  It's starting to get to me.
[00:47:05.318 --> 00:47:07.000]  I mean, this stuff is just out of control.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.241]  Debbie, good to have you on.
[00:47:08.261 --> 00:47:08.782]  God bless you.
[00:47:09.222 --> 00:47:10.543]  God bless you too, Alex.
[00:47:10.623 --> 00:47:17.987]  And also, we are having a little trouble with our phone lines from all the rain, so please leave good messages if I have to call you back.
[00:47:18.267 --> 00:47:21.409]  Okay, take care, Debbie.
[00:47:21.449 --> 00:47:22.149]  Thank you.
[00:47:22.189 --> 00:47:22.410]  Bye-bye.
[00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.670]  888-803-4438.
[00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:26.852]  Okay, so they're putting up federally controlled cameras in, quote, control grids.
[00:47:26.912 --> 00:47:27.432]  See the term?
[00:47:27.452 --> 00:47:30.454]  That's because it's a Pentagon term.
[00:47:30.674 --> 00:47:32.615]  They design the roads, the cameras, they run it all.
[00:47:33.016 --> 00:47:33.796]  It's all Pentagon-run.
[00:47:33.816 --> 00:47:35.137]  They directly work with the foreign banks.
[00:47:35.777 --> 00:47:38.199]  Okay, it's not our government, not our media, not our culture anymore.
[00:47:38.219 --> 00:47:38.839]  It's been taken over.
[00:47:39.401 --> 00:47:40.602]  Illegal aliens are above the law.
[00:47:40.622 --> 00:47:41.943]  I just read that Bloomberg article.
[00:47:42.704 --> 00:47:45.467]  And here's another story from 911blogger up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:47:45.787 --> 00:47:46.548]  Papers, please.
[00:47:46.588 --> 00:47:50.952]  Brother Elliot Bates Shalom Ministries arrested by Indiana Police.
[00:47:52.032 --> 00:48:03.603]  And it goes on to say, of course, that's Raymond Schwab and Elliot Nash have, and we're going to be posting that video up there on the site.
[00:48:04.651 --> 00:48:06.172]  And here to tell us what happened.
[00:48:06.573 --> 00:48:09.175]  In fact, which of the two pastors do we have on?
[00:48:10.476 --> 00:48:11.937]  Elliot, tell us what happened to you.
[00:48:11.957 --> 00:48:14.298]  Tell us about how... I mean, you just went to court this morning.
[00:48:14.318 --> 00:48:15.640]  This happened last week.
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:19.182]  And now you just went to court today as evil Al Qaeda.
[00:48:19.222 --> 00:48:19.623]  What happened?
[00:48:19.643 --> 00:48:27.168]  I went to court this morning and they said with my charges I would be facing a year in prison, possibly, and a $5,000 fine.
[00:48:27.468 --> 00:48:32.712]  And I told them about what we're doing and talked to an attorney.
[00:48:34.133 --> 00:48:36.054]  He... They decided to dismiss it.
[00:48:36.534 --> 00:48:43.337]  I asked for a motion... But if the cops would have had their way, they had a sign on the street, they knew you were in prison!
[00:48:43.477 --> 00:48:44.678]  I mean, they feel good, folks.
[00:48:44.718 --> 00:48:47.079]  They send innocent people to jail every minute.
[00:48:47.399 --> 00:48:48.599]  And they sleep good.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.861]  They send them to the lethal injection chair, at least half of them are innocent.
[00:48:53.141 --> 00:48:55.963]  I'm for the death penalty, but I'm not for it because this government can't be trusted.
[00:48:55.983 --> 00:48:56.663]  Go ahead, I'll shut up.
[00:48:58.007 --> 00:49:04.352]  Yeah, I got stopped earlier in the day yesterday and they tried to take my camera away and I wouldn't get my ID and he just left me there.
[00:49:04.392 --> 00:49:10.857]  Let's go back, because the police state so bad, like piranha, they're attacking, but I mean, go back to how it started.
[00:49:11.838 --> 00:49:15.241]  Yeah, like I said, I got contacted earlier in the day by a police officer.
[00:49:15.281 --> 00:49:16.402]  He tried to take my camera.
[00:49:16.502 --> 00:49:17.382]  I wouldn't get my ID.
[00:49:17.422 --> 00:49:17.823]  He left.
[00:49:18.303 --> 00:49:20.725]  About 45 minutes later, they sent a sergeant out.
[00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:23.452]  And he asked for my ID as well.
[00:49:23.792 --> 00:49:28.193]  And it was obvious that I was protesting the Christian support of the war and preaching the gospel.
[00:49:28.253 --> 00:49:31.394]  And I said, I don't feel obligated to give you my ID.
[00:49:31.874 --> 00:49:35.115]  He called for backup and they took my camera.
[00:49:35.515 --> 00:49:38.396]  They cuffed me and put me in the back of the patrol car.
[00:49:38.416 --> 00:49:45.718]  And they actually took my keys and they drove to our vehicle, which we keep along the side of the road for when we're done walking.
[00:49:45.778 --> 00:49:49.459]  And they ransacked the vehicle, took about 45 minutes searching it.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.441]  Looking for incriminating evidence.
[00:49:52.242 --> 00:49:53.883]  And then they took me to jail.
[00:49:54.003 --> 00:49:55.484]  Now you know you've been blessed so far.
[00:49:55.524 --> 00:49:57.406]  You're probably going to run into the really criminal ones.
[00:49:57.826 --> 00:50:00.789]  See, there's nothing worse than these guys that think they're good but engage in all this evil.
[00:50:01.009 --> 00:50:02.450]  You're going to run into real criminal cops.
[00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:04.131]  You're probably going to get some drugs planted on you.
[00:50:05.472 --> 00:50:08.034]  Just be prepared for that, but please continue.
[00:50:09.115 --> 00:50:13.158]  Well, blessed are we when we're persecuted for righteousness' sake, Jesus said.
[00:50:14.019 --> 00:50:15.580]  So, I went to jail.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:16.381]  It's been about
[00:50:17.043 --> 00:50:18.383]  Let's stop right there.
[00:50:18.403 --> 00:50:19.164]  I'm going to hold you over.
[00:50:19.964 --> 00:50:23.004]  Specifically, were they having pleasure taunts in the car?
[00:50:23.224 --> 00:50:24.725]  Were there any celebrations of evil?
[00:50:26.865 --> 00:50:28.346]  No.
[00:50:28.826 --> 00:50:35.927]  They just left me in the patrol car and they were talking and what they were finding in the car.
[00:50:36.307 --> 00:50:39.088]  They were actually behind the patrol car.
[00:50:39.108 --> 00:50:43.469]  So they didn't do any victory celebrations how they were stabbing America directly in the heart?
[00:50:44.426 --> 00:50:46.167]  There's a lot of time for a little celebration, okay.
[00:50:46.448 --> 00:50:48.689]  So at least there was no celebration at the destruction of America.
[00:50:48.989 --> 00:50:52.152]  Usually there has to be a little victory dance, like in the end zone on our corpse.
[00:50:52.652 --> 00:50:54.233]  Stay there, I want to hear all about it.
[00:50:54.874 --> 00:50:55.914]  Did they erase the tape?
[00:50:55.974 --> 00:50:56.715]  Did you get it back?
[00:50:57.015 --> 00:50:59.417]  Do you have the Lords on video?
[00:50:59.717 --> 00:51:00.378]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:04.665 --> 00:51:10.115]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.495 --> 00:51:18.128]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:25.873]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.273 --> 00:51:37.679]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.999 --> 00:51:41.701]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.961 --> 00:51:43.942]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.222 --> 00:51:48.084]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:01.405 --> 00:53:03.106]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:03.327 --> 00:53:07.029]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:09.571]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:53:10.092 --> 00:53:16.297]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:16.457 --> 00:53:21.361]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.561 --> 00:53:30.508]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:54:07.783 --> 00:54:10.565]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.946 --> 00:54:14.468]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:54:14.909 --> 00:54:18.992]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:54:19.452 --> 00:54:26.057]  That's right, don't worry, history always shows that scum fails in the end, collapses of their own parasitic evil.
[00:54:26.832 --> 00:54:29.474]  Just keep letting everybody know how evil you are.
[00:54:29.514 --> 00:54:36.579]  No amount of cop shows on TV, no amount of 24, no amount of propaganda can sell your bull.
[00:54:36.639 --> 00:54:41.243]  Not your fake global warming garbage, not your amnesty propaganda, none of it!
[00:54:42.644 --> 00:54:44.525]  And you bet I'm angry, I'm sick of it!
[00:54:47.467 --> 00:54:56.054]  Every one of us should be really upset, folks, that everywhere Elliot Nash and Raymond Schwab go, very polite, not confrontational,
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:59.781]  In small towns everywhere, they'll just stand in the street corner and preach.
[00:54:59.921 --> 00:55:03.342]  And man, they run right up and arrest them or detain them or take their camera.
[00:55:04.462 --> 00:55:07.343]  Punish them by finding out where their kids are at and taking them.
[00:55:09.183 --> 00:55:12.284]  I mean, and saying, I can charge you with felonies for videotaping me.
[00:55:12.664 --> 00:55:14.284]  You want to see the police state we're in.
[00:55:14.304 --> 00:55:16.065]  This is not a free country like it used to be.
[00:55:16.625 --> 00:55:18.466]  And once you go over the edge, you drop.
[00:55:19.046 --> 00:55:20.206]  Don't you get that, people?
[00:55:20.726 --> 00:55:22.587]  You don't stop once you go over the edge.
[00:55:22.847 --> 00:55:23.987]  You sink right to the bottom.
[00:55:24.714 --> 00:55:28.597]  Unfortunately, when they gave me back the camera as I got booked out of jail, I checked the tape and they rewound it.
[00:55:28.637 --> 00:55:31.059]  On the tape now is about a split second of me walking up to them.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:56.764]  And then the lens cap is on, and you can hear the CB radio and the patrol car, me in the back seat, and the officer, so it's obvious that he rewound the tape and recorded over it, because there's no way I would have had control over it.
[00:55:56.784 --> 00:55:58.164]  So we can prove that there's a race.
[00:55:59.024 --> 00:55:59.784]  I can't believe it.
[00:55:59.804 --> 00:56:02.485]  And then they take your property and destroy it.
[00:56:02.525 --> 00:56:04.266]  They just... pure evil, folks.
[00:56:04.626 --> 00:56:06.587]  And once they start, it doesn't stop.
[00:56:08.047 --> 00:56:09.908]  We're gonna have to go through Nazi Germany, folks.
[00:56:09.928 --> 00:56:11.168]  You're gonna have to experience it.
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:14.101]  Yeah, like I said, I just spent about four hours in jail.
[00:56:14.121 --> 00:56:14.842]  It was actually a blessing.
[00:56:14.882 --> 00:56:17.624]  I got to tell people about our ministry and about the Lord.
[00:56:29.324 --> 00:56:31.906]  One of the cops in there, a sheriff, was upset.
[00:56:32.026 --> 00:56:44.394]  He was a Christian as well, and he actually went out of his way to go to my car, which was impounded, and he broke in and got my ID out, and fortunately, I didn't have to spend a night in jail, and I went to court this morning.
[00:56:44.414 --> 00:56:45.755]  So there are still good people.
[00:56:45.775 --> 00:56:47.956]  We need to make that point, but the system is wicked.
[00:56:48.417 --> 00:56:49.157]  This is the proof.
[00:56:49.177 --> 00:56:54.861]  You guys just walk across the country and are literally going through like a pilgrim's progress of assaults.
[00:56:56.582 --> 00:56:57.923]  Yeah, we literally get stopped
[00:56:58.444 --> 00:57:01.145]  Sometimes three times a day out on the road.
[00:57:03.425 --> 00:57:15.788]  You need to go back before you leave and videotape the police department videotape what happened because I you know I want to take clips of this at least and put it on the web but you know I may still make a film about 9-11 truth or at least part of a film about it.
[00:57:16.208 --> 00:57:17.128]  I'm not sure though.
[00:57:17.709 --> 00:57:23.570]  There may be things that are even more important to the fight for the Republic but I think your case in point regardless needs to be told.
[00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:27.291]  Yeah and just a couple days ago we had a
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.921]  We had a video we posted.
[00:57:29.941 --> 00:57:35.785]  It's on our website where Brother Raymond was stopped and the officer got in his face.
[00:57:35.845 --> 00:57:40.027]  He started stepping on his sign and he said, it's my right to protect you.
[00:57:40.047 --> 00:57:44.010]  And he wanted to put him, force him in the car and drive him and drop him off out of the county.
[00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:46.651]  So it's my right.
[00:57:47.932 --> 00:57:49.493]  We literally deal with this every day.
[00:57:49.513 --> 00:57:51.694]  They literally just,
[00:57:54.005 --> 00:57:54.845]  It's a spirit.
[00:57:54.865 --> 00:57:57.867]  I mean, it really is a spirit of evil, folks.
[00:57:58.787 --> 00:57:59.887]  It's upon the land.
[00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:09.511]  Yeah, our battle is not flesh and blood, but it's against spiritual hosts of wickedness, principalities, and power.
[00:58:10.391 --> 00:58:11.792]  Well, I don't know how you're so calm, man.
[00:58:11.832 --> 00:58:13.153]  It just literally enrages me.
[00:58:14.413 --> 00:58:15.814]  I literally am just enraged.
[00:58:18.189 --> 00:58:25.872]  I'm very upset as well, but I mean, the only way we can overcome this evil is through good, to be humble, and to love our enemies, and pray for those who persecute us.
[00:58:26.952 --> 00:58:32.854]  Yeah, well, there's other cases in the Bible too where people aren't humble, but there's a time to be humble, and there's a time for war.
[00:58:33.334 --> 00:58:38.716]  And I'm not saying it's time for war, but you know what Moses did there in the mud pits, and I'm just getting sick of it!

[00:58:57.728 --> 00:58:58.389]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.049 --> 00:59:00.090]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.811 --> 00:59:01.951]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.572 --> 00:59:03.413]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.153 --> 00:59:05.074]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.715 --> 00:59:09.678]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.898 --> 00:59:14.041]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.523 --> 00:59:20.867]  If you know history, ladies and gentlemen, your knees would be knocking together right now.
[00:59:20.887 --> 00:59:26.151]  Because when governments start acting like they're acting right now, millions start dying.
[00:59:27.034 --> 00:59:27.995]  And it gets bad.
[00:59:29.356 --> 00:59:30.437]  It gets real bad.
[00:59:31.919 --> 00:59:38.525]  I got articles stacked up where they call it control grids, military design cameras going in from New York to Dallas, Texas.
[00:59:39.305 --> 00:59:50.656]  We got news where old women are being brutally assaulted by police and taken to jail for not watering their yard while convicted hardcore felons are killing cops and getting away with it as long as they're illegal aliens.
[00:59:51.568 --> 00:59:55.572]  I got news, we're now hundreds of billions more missing from the Pentagon.
[00:59:55.932 --> 00:59:58.434]  Wall-to-wall corruption, scams everywhere.
[00:59:58.734 --> 01:00:00.796]  Just evil is coming out of its shell, folks.
[01:00:01.237 --> 01:00:02.958]  It's walking all over us right now.
[01:00:03.379 --> 01:00:13.908]  And they've got all these, what you call, quasi-good people serving the system because they've been brainwashed into believing, you know, that everybody's got to submit to them and that they're basically God and everybody's got to go along with them.
[01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:18.031]  Now, we're talking to
[01:00:20.493 --> 01:00:26.455]  Elliot Nish with Bake Shalom Ministries, who we've been covering since the beginning of their walk a few months ago.
[01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:31.897]  They are stopped every day, everywhere, harassed, poked, prodded, attacked.
[01:00:32.478 --> 01:00:35.419]  Children, children, they find out where their kids are at, CPS them.
[01:00:37.139 --> 01:00:38.740]  And now he was arrested.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.301]  The police erased the tape.
[01:00:41.261 --> 01:00:43.422]  Thank God that they did drop the charges.
[01:00:43.762 --> 01:00:46.363]  Now, when were you told you're facing a year in prison?
[01:00:46.723 --> 01:00:47.403]  And for what?
[01:00:47.463 --> 01:00:52.766]  What were you told in Terre Haute at the Federal Execution Command Base by the local police?
[01:00:52.806 --> 01:00:53.226]  What happened?
[01:00:54.206 --> 01:01:00.709]  At court this morning is when the judge said your charges, you're facing possibly a year in prison and a $5,000 fine.
[01:01:02.071 --> 01:01:14.594]  And at the bookend they couldn't find any charges against failure to identify so they just said that I was giving false information and that was my charge and I plead with the judge to hear my case today.
[01:01:14.894 --> 01:01:16.614]  Which by the way isn't even a law either.
[01:01:16.634 --> 01:01:28.377]  I mean if these idiots even knew laws they could have said giving false information to a federal officer but that's federal and failure ID has been thrown out literally thousands of times but they just keep doing it.
[01:01:29.717 --> 01:01:30.457]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:01:30.497 --> 01:01:35.098]  The judge was mean and thought your knees would go together and then he would have you plead a lesser.
[01:01:35.298 --> 01:01:37.218]  But it sounds like you stayed the course and it didn't happen.
[01:01:37.538 --> 01:01:41.659]  So again, there's the judge engaged in color of law and fraud from the bench and judicial misconduct.
[01:01:41.679 --> 01:01:42.119]  Go ahead, please.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:47.480]  Yeah, with carry stops, we don't have to give our ID.
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:53.441]  The only reason they can ask for your ID is if you're suspicious of committing a crime.
[01:01:53.921 --> 01:01:56.842]  And the law officers actually thought that
[01:01:57.412 --> 01:02:06.474]  That was a law that you had to present your ID upon request so we're trying to we're filing complaints right now and hopefully there will be reprimands within the
[01:02:07.854 --> 01:02:12.417]  You need to walk up to police and ask them, you need to ask them why.
[01:02:12.817 --> 01:02:16.640]  Man, if I wasn't doing this radio show and finishing Endgame, I promise you brother, I'd come walk with you.
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:20.342]  I literally have been just dreaming about coming and walking.
[01:02:20.362 --> 01:02:20.822]  You know what?
[01:02:21.203 --> 01:02:22.964]  We need listeners to come and join you.
[01:02:23.344 --> 01:02:24.245]  That is the answer.
[01:02:24.385 --> 01:02:25.406]  I'm praying right now.
[01:02:25.726 --> 01:02:29.168]  I know there are retirees, there are veterans, there are people out there.
[01:02:29.188 --> 01:02:30.309]  I demand,
[01:02:31.036 --> 01:02:40.363]  I'm begging you folks, I want to call into the network, or if you want you can give out your number, but folks please don't call them with just advice, or you know, because they'll run up their phone bill, they don't have a lot of money.
[01:02:41.064 --> 01:02:46.788]  I know we've gotten you guys some support, just like we try to support, we are changing others, but you know what, that's the answer.
[01:02:46.828 --> 01:02:53.753]  We need 50 people to walk with you, and I promise you, plus I like to walk, I love walking, I love, that's just in my blood.
[01:02:54.074 --> 01:02:58.677]  I wish I could come join you and walk across this beautiful land, and be there with you during this persecution.
[01:03:00.158 --> 01:03:02.922]  Literally pray I could be with, but I've got this work I have to finish.
[01:03:03.463 --> 01:03:09.492]  But I'm tempted, and then I have a family, and I have my great... I have all the things I'm doing here, and all the great things I'm doing here.
[01:03:09.832 --> 01:03:12.877]  I just... Man, I just really want to be with you guys.
[01:03:13.338 --> 01:03:15.180]  How do folks... Shouldn't people come join you?
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.282]  Can folks come join you?
[01:03:17.327 --> 01:03:18.888]  That was our goal when we started walking.
[01:03:18.908 --> 01:03:22.530]  We wanted people out of each state to walk with us, even if it be for a day.
[01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:25.251]  But I think we've only had one other person choose to do that.
[01:03:25.591 --> 01:03:28.052]  Alright, we need everybody to join you.
[01:03:28.092 --> 01:03:29.793]  This is now like Pilgrim's Progress.
[01:03:30.394 --> 01:03:31.854]  Folks, they're children taken.
[01:03:32.455 --> 01:03:33.095]  Arrested.
[01:03:33.735 --> 01:03:37.057]  Literally the hounds of hell on them every mile.
[01:03:37.837 --> 01:03:39.278]  You need to join them.
[01:03:39.298 --> 01:03:41.659]  You need to put yourselves in this position.
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:44.141]  You need to experience the police state.
[01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:46.862]  You need to see it for yourself.
[01:03:47.705 --> 01:03:52.689]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:54.350]  Terrorism.
[01:03:54.490 --> 01:03:55.270]  Terrorism.
[01:03:55.350 --> 01:04:01.415]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:04:01.675 --> 01:04:03.256]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:04:03.496 --> 01:04:05.998]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:04:06.378 --> 01:04:13.063]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne
[01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:14.084]  We're good to go.
[01:04:34.446 --> 01:04:40.112]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:04:56.073 --> 01:05:01.519]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:09.548]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.242 --> 01:05:17.305]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:29.130]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:32.932]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.412 --> 01:05:35.353]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.673 --> 01:05:39.495]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:52.898 --> 01:05:55.839]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[01:05:55.999 --> 01:06:01.240]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes and more?
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:06.822]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:06:07.242 --> 01:06:08.322]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:08.702 --> 01:06:17.527]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:06:18.048 --> 01:06:19.648]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[01:06:57.865 --> 01:06:58.505]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.166 --> 01:07:00.226]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.927 --> 01:07:02.067]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.707 --> 01:07:03.508]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.268 --> 01:07:05.129]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.849 --> 01:07:09.711]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.011 --> 01:07:14.113]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.193 --> 01:07:16.334]  This is it, men!
[01:07:17.034 --> 01:07:21.517]  We are engaging the New World Order Crime Syndicate at point-blank range.
[01:07:21.937 --> 01:07:28.621]  For the listeners, for the activists, for all of you that are out there on the front lines, in the real world and in cyberspace.
[01:07:29.221 --> 01:07:32.643]  We are engaging pure evil in a historical fight.
[01:07:33.063 --> 01:07:35.705]  We've got to ask God to lead, guide, and direct us.
[01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:38.346]  We've got to ask Yahweh for the guidance.
[01:07:38.426 --> 01:07:41.588]  We've got to stand together and realize that
[01:07:42.469 --> 01:07:45.810]  My friends, we are in very, very dark times.
[01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:49.531]  We are in times that do try men's souls.
[01:07:50.492 --> 01:07:59.635]  And I get mad at police because I'm threatened by you, and I realize how you've been brainwashed and twisted, and I know the great evils you're being forged and being prepared to rot.
[01:08:00.315 --> 01:08:04.376]  And I just beg you now, please, you know, deep in your gut, I'm telling the truth.
[01:08:04.416 --> 01:08:05.476]  You know it's wrong.
[01:08:05.776 --> 01:08:07.257]  You know things have gotten out of control.
[01:08:07.297 --> 01:08:10.338]  You know you're under gang psychology, under gang mentality.
[01:08:11.067 --> 01:08:13.808]  You know that bosses above you are very wicked.
[01:08:13.868 --> 01:08:17.969]  You know they're using scientific propaganda on the public as well as you.
[01:08:17.989 --> 01:08:19.009]  We are.
[01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:21.049]  And just look at what they're doing everywhere.
[01:08:21.109 --> 01:08:21.930]  My gosh, folks.
[01:08:24.150 --> 01:08:33.372]  And to just see what Brother Elliot and others have gone through in this country just tears my guts out.
[01:08:33.412 --> 01:08:35.033]  How do people get in contact with you?
[01:08:35.733 --> 01:08:37.333]  How long are you going to be in terror?
[01:08:37.953 --> 01:08:39.214]  And then where are you going next?
[01:08:39.254 --> 01:08:40.514]  And I just demand
[01:08:41.334 --> 01:08:51.199]  There's all these retired veterans, there's all these retired people, there's other folks that have plenty of money, unlike you guys who've got RVs.
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:54.421]  We have so many listeners in Indiana alone, it's insane.
[01:08:55.141 --> 01:08:58.723]  I demand, folks, we need hundreds of people to join them now.
[01:08:58.743 --> 01:09:04.126]  I mean, back when we first interviewed them two or three months ago, and they were starting this, and, hey, we're going to walk across the country, come out and see us, join us.
[01:09:04.146 --> 01:09:08.688]  Like, hey, what a neat walk, we'll cover it as it develops, and then see what it's now turned into.
[01:09:09.793 --> 01:09:12.155]  I was like, we'll see if it's going to be a police state while you're out there.
[01:09:12.435 --> 01:09:13.175]  Let's hope not.
[01:09:13.556 --> 01:09:16.197]  And it's been absolutely horrible and worse than we thought.
[01:09:16.537 --> 01:09:18.519]  We're literally doing scientific tests here.
[01:09:18.919 --> 01:09:20.360]  These guys aren't like me, by the way.
[01:09:21.301 --> 01:09:23.022]  It's their humbleness almost invites it.
[01:09:23.822 --> 01:09:27.925]  Because me, I'd probably end up, in the end, it would probably turn out worse for me.
[01:09:27.945 --> 01:09:30.046]  Let me explain this.
[01:09:30.086 --> 01:09:31.127]  This is from past experience.
[01:09:31.627 --> 01:09:35.570]  Nine times out of ten, I would make the cops back down by being very stern with them and authoritative.
[01:09:36.310 --> 01:09:36.571]  Okay?
[01:09:39.582 --> 01:09:42.684]  Again, it's very gang member-like, so it's all the confidence.
[01:09:42.704 --> 01:09:45.966]  Okay, that's how that works when you're, you know, in King Rat mode.
[01:09:46.666 --> 01:09:46.986]  Okay?
[01:09:47.006 --> 01:09:48.787]  You know, you don't need to see our identification.
[01:09:48.807 --> 01:09:50.368]  These aren't the droids you're looking for, basically.
[01:09:51.088 --> 01:10:02.975]  But, then it wouldn't work on the wrong person, and I'd probably get beat down, or worse, or charged, or set up, because I'd mess with the wrong criminal cop, then they'd go all the way, because with them, it's all about having the power, and who wins in the end.
[01:10:03.595 --> 01:10:05.516]  You see, I'd be doing it from the opposite direction.
[01:10:05.816 --> 01:10:06.937]  I'm trying to expose this.
[01:10:08.398 --> 01:10:08.618]  So,
[01:10:10.042 --> 01:10:13.444]  What they're doing is the most effective way, but they are extremely humble.
[01:10:15.125 --> 01:10:20.887]  That's the key here, and you see these now 30, 40, I don't know how many videos there are on Google of this that they put up.
[01:10:21.988 --> 01:10:23.548]  And it illustrates it, folks.
[01:10:23.608 --> 01:10:25.990]  It illustrates, I love my family!
[01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:28.411]  I can't believe we've sunk this far!
[01:10:31.032 --> 01:10:32.192]  And I want to explain something.
[01:10:32.212 --> 01:10:37.215]  You know, the cop got run over years ago in Austin and bled to death in the street for 45 minutes.
[01:10:37.235 --> 01:10:37.815]  Nobody helped him.
[01:10:38.371 --> 01:10:39.872]  Or the lady that got raped in Toronto.
[01:10:39.912 --> 01:10:41.694]  I just use, you know, some of the cases we've covered here.
[01:10:41.934 --> 01:10:42.635]  I see them every day.
[01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:48.519]  Or the woman last week getting stabbed and bleeding to death, you know, right in the main aisle entrance, and people taking photos like she wasn't even a human.
[01:10:48.539 --> 01:10:51.302]  It's not just the cops that are turning bad, it's the people!
[01:10:52.162 --> 01:10:58.187]  I know that makes the cops' jobs worse, and then it just, it's a feedback loop as everybody becomes more evil, as we interact with each other.
[01:10:59.028 --> 01:11:01.930]  I attack the public, I attack myself, I'm not just attacking you cops!
[01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:03.551]  We've gone bad, folks!
[01:11:03.571 --> 01:11:04.112]  We're evil!
[01:11:04.907 --> 01:11:05.848]  And evil isn't cute.
[01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:14.736]  Some people I know think evil is cool, and skulls are cool, and darkness is cool, and in this culture torture is cool.
[01:11:15.097 --> 01:11:18.140]  But of course it's a weak chicken neck culture that thinks that.
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:21.583]  Cultures that have been through bondage and tyranny, they love the light.
[01:11:22.415 --> 01:11:24.196]  And they're strong, too, and they go towards it.
[01:11:24.396 --> 01:11:24.956]  And they love it.
[01:11:25.177 --> 01:11:27.378]  Because they've actually seen real darkness, folks.
[01:11:27.578 --> 01:11:30.920]  And once you've seen real darkness, I guess growing up I was blessed enough to see it.
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:32.901]  And so it made me a different person.
[01:11:33.141 --> 01:11:35.702]  You know there's nothing cool or cute about it, okay?
[01:11:35.902 --> 01:11:38.503]  There's nothing cool or cute about evil!
[01:11:38.904 --> 01:11:39.824]  It's not fun!
[01:11:40.204 --> 01:11:40.905]  It's horrible!
[01:11:42.325 --> 01:11:50.790]  I've been watching video of Nazi Germany and eugenicists here in the U.S., old film footage, of how in this country, too, they would take children and they would kill them.
[01:11:52.344 --> 01:11:55.766]  We got videos, folks, of the babies they took and killed in America.
[01:11:56.887 --> 01:11:57.247]  Okay?
[01:11:57.547 --> 01:11:58.908]  It started here and in England.
[01:11:59.128 --> 01:11:59.688]  The eugenics.
[01:11:59.728 --> 01:12:01.109]  And that's what runs everything today.
[01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:04.051]  That's the governing force of the New World Order.
[01:12:04.351 --> 01:12:05.412]  Kill, steal, and destroy.
[01:12:05.652 --> 01:12:07.673]  They have a religion of wanting to kill us.
[01:12:08.373 --> 01:12:10.274]  I don't know how else I can explain it to you.
[01:12:11.075 --> 01:12:13.956]  They love evil and they are giving you their loves.
[01:12:14.257 --> 01:12:15.778]  They are giving you their desires.
[01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:18.299]  We are taking on their evil, folks.
[01:12:18.639 --> 01:12:19.900]  I see it happening.
[01:12:21.011 --> 01:12:24.116]  Now at the same time, it's causing a lot of people to wake up.
[01:12:24.196 --> 01:12:25.999]  So evil is rising, good is rising.
[01:12:27.642 --> 01:12:35.815]  I got a bunch of other news I want to get to, and we got Aaron coming in for part two on the eugenics in about 40 minutes, but I want to go back to Brother Elliot Nesh.
[01:12:36.624 --> 01:12:45.589]  You want to comment on any of the things I just said from the heart there, or what you went through, or what happened when they released you, or what the judge said?
[01:12:45.889 --> 01:12:53.493]  I mean, how did they suddenly go from, you're going to spend a year in prison and it's a felony, we don't know what the charge is, but you're going to prison, to how did it change to, okay, we're dismissing it?
[01:12:54.814 --> 01:13:01.918]  I consulted a public defender there and ran over the laws with him and he pleaded with the judge, but to comment on some of the things he said,
[01:13:02.668 --> 01:13:11.615]  I think that we're so far into evil and wickedness and sin, and it abounds so much, and one of the reasons we don't recognize it is because it's come through incrementalism.
[01:13:12.055 --> 01:13:19.641]  It's like they've dimmed down the lights slowly, as if you were to walk into an Italian restaurant and it was all dark, your eyes would have to dilate.
[01:13:19.681 --> 01:13:27.668]  But they've slowly, slowly, slowly, we've gone into so much sin and wickedness, but where sin abounds, grace abounds much more.
[01:13:31.033 --> 01:13:32.594]  Well, and they see the light, too.
[01:13:32.634 --> 01:13:38.697]  When they see Christians, when they see people out fighting evil, they attack, because it's threatening to them, the light.
[01:13:38.717 --> 01:13:39.977]  They want to creep around in the dark.
[01:13:41.838 --> 01:13:47.221]  Yeah, and I think as more persecution comes, we're going to see a polarization between light and darkness.
[01:13:47.261 --> 01:13:50.062]  People are going to be forced to choose who they serve.
[01:13:51.143 --> 01:13:52.143]  So it's going to be a blessing.
[01:13:53.704 --> 01:13:54.845]  How do people join you?
[01:13:54.885 --> 01:13:56.525]  How long are you going to be in Terre Haute?
[01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:59.587]  How do people come there and walk with you?
[01:14:01.281 --> 01:14:12.485]  I'll give out my number, it's 970-443-7683 if you need to talk to us or you can just drop us an email on our website.
[01:14:12.585 --> 01:14:20.308]  I think we're going to postpone the walk for a couple days to try to get some legal representation if there's any listeners out there that could help us with that.
[01:14:20.368 --> 01:14:25.770]  We also have to go back to Kansas for the court case of Raymond's son who was kidnapped.
[01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:29.271]  Now the CPS claims they're going to let him go, but that could be a lie.
[01:14:30.336 --> 01:14:31.097]  Yeah, we don't know yet.
[01:14:31.117 --> 01:14:31.757]  We'll have to see.
[01:14:34.059 --> 01:14:36.620]  I mean, folks, you think about the persecution they've gone through.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:46.027]  I mean, it's... What I had you guys on a few weeks ago, and I'm going from memory, but did you say about 90% of the police are just literal demons?
[01:14:48.228 --> 01:14:50.690]  Yeah, I'd say the majority of them.
[01:14:51.710 --> 01:14:56.694]  They're just on power trips and we're, you know, they're corrupted.
[01:14:59.651 --> 01:15:04.873]  They just think they're God, and they think we're just here to just literally have no rights.
[01:15:05.313 --> 01:15:07.674]  Have you heard New York's going to ban videotaping, basically?
[01:15:09.594 --> 01:15:10.255]  I didn't hear that.
[01:15:10.555 --> 01:15:14.736]  Yeah, New York Times, New York Plans Surveillance Veil for downtown.
[01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:16.397]  They go on and call it a grid.
[01:15:17.117 --> 01:15:19.738]  Everything you do will be tracked, but then you're not supposed to videotape them.
[01:15:19.778 --> 01:15:21.979]  I mean, is that not... How is that America?
[01:15:22.199 --> 01:15:22.999]  How is that freedom?
[01:15:23.159 --> 01:15:25.400]  How can any of you say that's freedom, listening out there?
[01:15:28.137 --> 01:15:29.039]  You're absolutely right.
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:35.213]  The cops have video cameras in their cars when they stop us, but they don't allow us to videotape them.
[01:15:35.494 --> 01:15:37.278]  They think it's an invasion of their privacy.
[01:15:39.668 --> 01:15:40.929]  Unjust weights and measures.
[01:15:40.989 --> 01:15:41.749]  It's not fair.
[01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:43.131]  It's unconstitutional.
[01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:44.572]  It's a violation of the First Amendment.
[01:15:44.932 --> 01:15:50.317]  And of course, this whole New York thing, folks, they're trying to do it under film rules, under commercial licensees.
[01:15:50.798 --> 01:15:51.158]  Okay?
[01:15:51.639 --> 01:15:52.179]  Okay?
[01:15:52.519 --> 01:15:54.862]  This is First Amendment news gathering.
[01:15:55.042 --> 01:15:59.246]  None of you have your First Amendment removed from you.
[01:15:59.346 --> 01:16:00.507]  It's all color of law.
[01:16:00.767 --> 01:16:04.951]  They're trying to train you to voluntarily go into bondage through contractual agreements.
[01:16:05.929 --> 01:16:09.231]  Again, plug the website, plug how people can help you.
[01:16:10.472 --> 01:16:13.053]  It's baitshalomministries.org.
[01:16:13.113 --> 01:16:19.116]  That's B-E-I-T-S-H-A-L-O-M ministries.org.
[01:16:19.236 --> 01:16:32.883]  And if you want to support us, we've made three documentaries and we encourage people to get those, to donate if they feel led, and just watch our video updates and come walk with us if you can.
[01:16:32.923 --> 01:16:34.064]  We want people to join us
[01:16:34.634 --> 01:16:48.620]  On September 11th of this year, when we walk into D.C., we're merging with a couple other groups that are walking, and we hope to bring visibility to the war in Iraq and 9-11 truth, and to preach the good news of the Gospel.
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:57.343]  Absolutely, now, um, but, just correct me if I'm wrong, you have gotten substantial, I mean, you've gotten some support from the Western Ship, haven't you?
[01:16:58.204 --> 01:16:58.904]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:02.191]  That's why I love my listeners.
[01:17:02.251 --> 01:17:04.193]  Well, my friend, be careful while you're there.
[01:17:04.273 --> 01:17:08.977]  Shoot video to document it all, and we'll be praying for you and your family and everybody else.
[01:17:09.878 --> 01:17:10.359]  Thank you.
[01:17:10.439 --> 01:17:11.239]  You as well, Alex.
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:13.261]  Keep fighting the good fight, and Lord bless you.
[01:17:13.562 --> 01:17:14.302]  Thank you, my friend.
[01:17:15.603 --> 01:17:25.012]  That's why I love this radio show, because we try to take We Are Change, those folks, and give them a national platform so they can then get the attention and support they need.
[01:17:25.052 --> 01:17:25.773]  We try to support
[01:17:27.147 --> 01:17:27.587]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:17:50.285 --> 01:18:12.562]  Mother ship in our own quadrant you could say in the info war to support us I get so busy covering the news and info that you know we try to support our operation with the sponsors we have try to bring you good products on that front and also I've made 15 films now the 16th film second edition of Terror Storm is available we now have you can now order it shipping that out to you
[01:18:13.493 --> 01:18:13.873]  I think so.
[01:18:30.316 --> 01:18:32.057]  We'll be right back with global news.
[01:18:32.078 --> 01:18:32.378]  Stay with us.
[01:18:55.277 --> 01:19:06.543]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:19:06.743 --> 01:19:14.727]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:19:15.007 --> 01:19:25.691]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:19:25.911 --> 01:19:31.413]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[01:19:31.633 --> 01:19:35.554]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting
[01:19:35.794 --> 01:19:36.654]  We're good to go.
[01:19:54.657 --> 01:20:00.805]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live with an urgent message regarding Ed and Elaine Brown and their brave stand against the IRS.
[01:20:01.466 --> 01:20:11.578]  WTPRN.com and GCNLive.com join together to organize and promote the Live Free or Die concert on Saturday, July 14th in Flamefield, New Hampshire.
[01:20:11.818 --> 01:20:22.444]  Aside from a day of great music from bands like Poker Face, Dave von Kleist, Blue Eyed Fools, Paperback Radio, and many more, the true purpose of this event is to come to the defense of Ed and Elaine Brown.
[01:20:22.644 --> 01:20:26.527]  Friends, we're also in need of donations to cover costs of staging this historic event.
[01:20:26.727 --> 01:20:33.731]  Ed and Elaine Brown have put their lives on the line to stand up to the IRS's tyranny, so please give generously to help this concert become a success.
[01:20:33.931 --> 01:20:43.638]  Join me, Randy Weaver, and more surprise guests on July 14th to become part of this effort to defend the Browns, as it is literally a matter of life and death.
[01:20:43.778 --> 01:20:50.842]  Again, go to WTPRN.com or GCNlive.com and click on the Live Free or Die banner for all the information.
[01:20:51.022 --> 01:20:51.683]  I hope to see you there.
[01:20:55.498 --> 01:20:59.621]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:20:59.841 --> 01:21:01.602]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:21:01.862 --> 01:21:08.146]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:14.571]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:21:14.811 --> 01:21:20.855]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[01:21:21.135 --> 01:21:27.543]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:21:27.683 --> 01:21:31.248]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:21:31.528 --> 01:21:35.253]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:21:35.433 --> 01:21:37.976]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:21:38.117 --> 01:21:39.158]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:43.583]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625 That's 1-866-885-6625 1-866-885-6625
[01:21:54.131 --> 01:21:57.012]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:57.052 --> 01:22:01.494]  Did you know that Russia sponsored a terrorist training camp in Havana, Cuba in 1966?
[01:22:02.054 --> 01:22:07.716]  In this camp, they planned terrorist activity on every continent, including the United States.
[01:22:08.377 --> 01:22:12.258]  Have we seen terrorist activities on every continent just as they planned?
[01:22:12.798 --> 01:22:22.002]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:23.002 --> 01:22:24.504]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:24.664 --> 01:22:30.589]  That's 1-800-516-8736 for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:30.650 --> 01:22:31.110]  It's free.
[01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:36.055]  Call now while operators are standing by to take your call.
[01:22:46.593 --> 01:22:52.638]  We don't need no education.
[01:22:53.398 --> 01:22:56.961]  We don't need no thought control.
[01:22:57.121 --> 01:23:00.664]  No dark sarcasm in the classroom.
[01:23:23.713 --> 01:23:26.134]  I witnessed Hank Floyd.
[01:23:28.334 --> 01:23:34.976]  We had the television on Saturday, working here at the office all day long, with Live Aid on.
[01:23:35.016 --> 01:23:36.417]  And I would see Al Gore pop in and out.
[01:23:36.437 --> 01:23:38.797]  I would see Sting, now known as Stink.
[01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:40.718]  And I would see
[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:49.664]  All of them up there, and then look, Sting and Pink Floyd, all these people, they're well-meaning, they don't understand what they're part of.
[01:23:49.784 --> 01:23:51.825]  They think, oh, we're saving the Earth, the environment's in trouble.
[01:23:52.105 --> 01:23:53.046]  Yeah, this sounds great!
[01:23:53.726 --> 01:23:58.709]  And many of the members there, if you talk to them, go, oh no, there's no plan for global tax, we just want to cut back on these emissions.
[01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:01.770]  Well, it turned out it was a complete failure.
[01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:11.976]  You know, when you hear that they had a 2 billion person audience, that was, if every person on every cable system and every TV station in the world tuned into that, it would have been 2 billion.
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:17.884]  No, it was less than a hundred million people watching globally, conservatively.
[01:24:19.325 --> 01:24:21.346]  Only four and a half million watching in England.
[01:24:22.047 --> 01:24:31.674]  That is just, that's basically what tunes into the view every day in England, where this was billed as just the biggest thing since sliced bread.
[01:24:32.594 --> 01:24:39.860]  It completely fell on its face, though now on the heels of all this, the New York Times announcing and reporting
[01:24:40.561 --> 01:24:42.521]  Energy Chairman floats carbon tax.
[01:24:42.561 --> 01:24:51.783]  A powerful House Democrat, John D. Dingell, is introducing today a carbon tax that would raise the cost of burning oil, gas, coal for every family.
[01:24:51.823 --> 01:24:54.224]  And it is a tax directly on the consumer.
[01:24:55.804 --> 01:24:56.484]  Here's another one.
[01:24:56.664 --> 01:24:57.064]  Reuters.
[01:24:57.124 --> 01:24:58.985]  New Jersey Governor signs toughest U.S.
[01:24:59.045 --> 01:24:59.905]  carbon law.
[01:25:00.785 --> 01:25:01.665]  And he's put that into place.
[01:25:01.685 --> 01:25:04.546]  We're going to be covering more of this coming up in a few minutes.
[01:25:04.586 --> 01:25:09.967]  But right now, I want to play a few minutes from Friday when we had
[01:25:12.478 --> 01:25:14.278]  Lord Rothschild on the show.
[01:25:15.399 --> 01:25:21.600]  We had the heir to the biggest Rothschild trust fund.
[01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:26.701]  He's an adventure, a TV star of all these TV shows, saving the Earth.
[01:25:26.721 --> 01:25:28.202]  That's what it says on his own website.
[01:25:28.982 --> 01:25:32.863]  And we have an article out on this at PrisonPlanet.com that Paul Watson did.
[01:25:32.883 --> 01:25:33.803]  I hope you get out to everybody.
[01:25:34.163 --> 01:25:38.244]  Top global warming advocate, Jupiter and Saturn closer to Sun than Earth.
[01:25:39.404 --> 01:25:46.047]  Live Earth Kingpin dismantles his own credibility on national radio as propaganda bandwagon is a massive flop.
[01:25:47.148 --> 01:26:06.797]  Live Earth, half-empty stadiums, and lackluster TV viewing figures were preceded by another embarrassment after one of the propaganda bandwagon kingpins, the top global warming advocate, responded to a question about solar system-wide climate change by claiming that Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn were closer to the Sun than Earth.
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:12.163]  Of course, that's not their position, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:13.685 --> 01:26:23.773]  Their position, from the Sun out, is Sun or Sol, Yellow Dwarf standard, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto.
[01:26:23.793 --> 01:26:24.754]  Okay?
[01:26:25.755 --> 01:26:26.095]  Alright.
[01:26:27.837 --> 01:26:29.118]  Every school child should know that.
[01:26:30.019 --> 01:26:32.641]  I certainly knew that by the time I was about five, but of course I like space.
[01:26:32.701 --> 01:26:33.742]  What five-year-old doesn't?
[01:26:34.602 --> 01:26:41.435]  David Mayer de Rothschild is the youngest child born in 1978 of Sir Evelyn de Rothschild of the British wing of the Rothschild banking family.
[01:26:41.836 --> 01:26:46.265]  Rothschild's recent book, 77 Essential Skills to Stop Climate Change, calls for ordinary people to limit
[01:26:47.014 --> 01:26:52.539]  Outward behavior and even work at home as part of a PR blitz to accompany the Live Earth Project.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:57.123]  Another thing here is they mix in things that sound reasonable.
[01:26:57.463 --> 01:26:58.244]  Try to work at home.
[01:26:58.584 --> 01:27:00.466]  Try to not pollute as much.
[01:27:00.546 --> 01:27:01.747]  That's all real and good.
[01:27:01.987 --> 01:27:04.369]  But she doesn't have that with government or with taxes.
[01:27:05.210 --> 01:27:08.733]  And then real crises like the genetic engineering, cross-species, hybrids.
[01:27:10.171 --> 01:27:14.333]  All of these things that are really causing problems, toxic waste dumping, that's all ignored.
[01:27:14.853 --> 01:27:17.414]  Or they mention it and then say the answer is a global tax.
[01:27:18.074 --> 01:27:20.515]  By the very people that are the progenitors of this.
[01:27:20.955 --> 01:27:22.896]  By the very people that are running this.
[01:27:23.176 --> 01:27:25.897]  By the very people that are the kingpins of all of this.
[01:27:27.718 --> 01:27:27.898]  Okay?
[01:27:31.388 --> 01:27:40.716]  We should have added to the article, but you can't add all of his baloney to it, that he also said that his book wasn't for children, but then we have mainstream news articles where he says the main focus of the book is that children.
[01:27:41.097 --> 01:27:42.298]  This book is written for children.
[01:27:42.618 --> 01:27:44.320]  On the show he said I was insane, it wasn't true.
[01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:51.526]  And of course at the time I was debating him, I didn't, I had a stack of articles I hadn't highlighted, I had to look around after he was gone, I found the actual quote.
[01:27:53.188 --> 01:27:54.989]  And again I've lost it, I need to dig it out here.
[01:27:55.009 --> 01:27:57.852]  You know what, I'll find it during a break and cover it, if I'm able to find it.
[01:27:59.099 --> 01:28:03.981]  But you can type in his name, David Rothschild, and then type in main focus on children, and it should pop up.
[01:28:04.502 --> 01:28:05.162]  Like, I could do that.
[01:28:06.543 --> 01:28:08.824]  But, uh, into the search engine.
[01:28:10.965 --> 01:28:12.245]  But, but, folks, he knew!
[01:28:12.345 --> 01:28:13.286]  He giggled about it.
[01:28:13.326 --> 01:28:16.527]  And then two separate times I brought it back up for him to correct himself, and he just giggled again.
[01:28:17.248 --> 01:28:18.888]  Because he's targeting the mass.
[01:28:18.928 --> 01:28:20.809]  He's been told by the experts, dumb it down.
[01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:23.551]  So he just said, well, that's because those planets are closer to the sun.
[01:28:23.851 --> 01:28:24.791]  And then he laughed.
[01:28:25.912 --> 01:28:26.472]  See, he knew!
[01:28:27.762 --> 01:28:32.147]  And by the way, a lot of people listening, even to this show, will now question me.
[01:28:32.187 --> 01:28:33.288]  Maybe Alex is lying.
[01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:34.950]  Maybe Jupiter is closer.
[01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:37.132]  Maybe Mars is closer to the Sun than Earth.
[01:28:37.833 --> 01:28:40.956]  Just like they tell you Al-Qaeda's real.
[01:28:43.679 --> 01:28:44.640]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:46.682]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.603 --> 01:28:50.286]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.507 --> 01:28:58.089]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:28:58.489 --> 01:29:01.411]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:29:01.731 --> 01:29:04.312]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:29:04.672 --> 01:29:09.494]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:29:09.874 --> 01:29:15.237]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:29:15.537 --> 01:29:18.498]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[01:29:18.698 --> 01:29:19.378]  We're good to go.
[01:29:42.083 --> 01:29:42.544]  We're good to go.
[01:29:54.366 --> 01:29:54.986]  Morning, neighbor!
[01:29:55.366 --> 01:29:57.047]  Hey, shouldn't you be at work?
[01:29:57.467 --> 01:29:57.787]  I am.
[01:29:58.047 --> 01:30:00.008]  As a matter of fact, I pulled another all-nighter.
[01:30:00.248 --> 01:30:00.888]  What do you mean?
[01:30:00.908 --> 01:30:03.990]  Well, I'm working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:06.370]  Well, at least I'm making money 24-7.
[01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:07.671]  But I never have to go to work.
[01:30:07.971 --> 01:30:08.911]  So, what do you do?
[01:30:09.191 --> 01:30:10.292]  Not very much at all now.
[01:30:10.592 --> 01:30:12.393]  About a month ago, I heard about this website.
[01:30:12.413 --> 01:30:13.293]  It's got a funny name.
[01:30:13.353 --> 01:30:15.654]  It's DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:30:16.414 --> 01:30:17.275]  That is funny.
[01:30:17.295 --> 01:30:22.278]  Yeah, you can earn $1,200 to $12,000 a week starting the very first week.
[01:30:22.818 --> 01:30:24.880]  Oh, is that how you bought that new mower?
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.802]  Yeah, and the motorcycle I've always wanted, too.
[01:30:27.982 --> 01:30:28.662]  You should log on.
[01:30:28.803 --> 01:30:30.704]  Find out how you can become financially free.
[01:30:30.864 --> 01:30:32.325]  So, what was that website?
[01:30:32.405 --> 01:30:39.410]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com Just wait, I'll go get a pen so I can write that down.
[01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:40.791]  You don't need to write it down.
[01:30:40.831 --> 01:30:41.711]  It's easy to remember.
[01:30:41.971 --> 01:30:45.333]  DidYouRobBillGates.com Yeah!
[01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:49.315]  DidYouRobBillGates.com That is easy!
[01:30:49.635 --> 01:30:52.316]  It's easy, and the money is awesome!
[01:30:54.557 --> 01:31:01.381]  You want to lose weight, but there's no way you want to resort to pills or shakes that are full of chemicals or drugs with harmful side effects.
[01:31:01.883 --> 01:31:03.143]  We know diets don't work.
[01:31:03.444 --> 01:31:05.304]  That's why there's the Fat Loss Patch.
[01:31:05.484 --> 01:31:12.507]  The Fat Loss Patch is a self-adhesive dietary aid worn daily that slowly releases all natural ingredients into the skin.
[01:31:12.707 --> 01:31:20.210]  The result is a safe and easy way for you to increase your energy levels, maintain a healthy body weight, and curb those horrible sugar cravings.
[01:31:20.590 --> 01:31:23.351]  All without irritating side effects or loss of muscle.
[01:31:23.551 --> 01:31:26.472]  Just peel it off, stick it on, and live your life.
[01:31:26.952 --> 01:31:29.774]  The Patch is safe, effective, and clinically tested.
[01:31:29.935 --> 01:31:34.778]  Also, the Fat Loss Patch is the most unique product and business opportunity to ever hit the U.S.
[01:31:34.919 --> 01:31:36.079]  and international markets.
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:37.461]  Join as a U.S.
[01:31:37.561 --> 01:31:41.924]  or European customer or distributor in this much-needed and fast-growing business.
[01:31:42.244 --> 01:31:46.288]  For more information, visit PatchMeeting.com or call Judy at 800-766-2133.
[01:31:46.388 --> 01:31:46.588]  That's 800-766-2133.
[01:31:56.448 --> 01:31:58.169]  Big John!
[01:31:59.650 --> 01:32:02.212]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[01:32:02.252 --> 01:32:05.034]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[01:32:05.074 --> 01:32:07.656]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[01:32:07.716 --> 01:32:11.359]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lift to Big John.
[01:32:11.379 --> 01:32:14.921]  Big John!
[01:32:15.842 --> 01:32:18.144]  Big John!
[01:32:18.684 --> 01:32:20.325]  Big Bad John!
[01:32:21.566 --> 01:32:22.627]  Big John!
[01:32:24.725 --> 01:32:27.366]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home.
[01:32:27.406 --> 01:32:30.048]  He just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
[01:32:30.068 --> 01:32:34.530]  Didn't say much, kind of quiet and shy, but he spoke it all.
[01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:36.531]  He just said hi to Big John.
[01:32:36.591 --> 01:32:44.135]  Alright, I'm going to play this Ron Paul clip from this week with George Stephanopoulos.
[01:32:45.356 --> 01:32:47.077]  But right now, let me finish up with Rothschild.
[01:32:47.137 --> 01:32:53.500]  Here is just a few minutes from a segment with Rothschild, and he went on two more times to say, yes, the planets
[01:32:54.828 --> 01:32:59.376]  The gas giants and Mars are closer to the Sun than Earth.
[01:33:00.057 --> 01:33:03.764]  Because again, the Sun isn't causing global warming, it's your SUVs.
[01:33:03.824 --> 01:33:06.829]  And if you believe that, again, I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
[01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:07.830]  So here it is.
[01:33:13.625 --> 01:33:28.079]  Well, all the environmentalists I talk to and conservationists, when they see Disney and when they see the Discovery Channel and Wall Street and the NFL getting behind global warming, man-made global warming, they say something's wrong.
[01:33:29.457 --> 01:33:42.307]  And of course I should bring up to Mr. Rothschild that the polar ice caps of Mars are receding at several miles a year, much faster than ours, and that the moons of Saturn and Jupiter are melting.
[01:33:42.387 --> 01:33:45.489]  In fact, several of their moons were ice and are now liquid seas.
[01:33:47.154 --> 01:33:51.118]  Now, how are SUVs causing that, David Rothschild?
[01:33:51.138 --> 01:33:53.820]  That's because those planets are closer to the sun, my friend.
[01:33:55.141 --> 01:33:59.285]  No, Jupiter and Saturn are not closer to the sun, neither is Mars.
[01:33:59.886 --> 01:34:08.654]  Yes, I think you'll find, right, that the very simple matter, and what I want to defend, this is my final point, and then I'll let you continue with your line that global warming doesn't exist.
[01:34:09.014 --> 01:34:16.564]  I find it very sad that we're still in a day and age where there is a certain mentality or a certain sector that wants to deny that these things are happening.
[01:34:16.904 --> 01:34:20.849]  And you say you don't believe that human beings are responsible for climate change.
[01:34:21.149 --> 01:34:21.670]  That's fine.
[01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:22.912]  And I respect your opinion.
[01:34:22.932 --> 01:34:23.813]  I respect your views.
[01:34:24.253 --> 01:34:31.136]  I think those that you have to realize, if you look at the science, forget your taxation theory, because actually it's not taxation.
[01:34:31.176 --> 01:34:46.822]  What it's trying to do, the taxation bit, is sitting there as one tiny fragment of saying that the polluters of our planet, the companies that are excessively polluting, the only way that they will respond and listen is if they're incentivized through a tax scheme to stop them polluting.
[01:34:47.142 --> 01:34:47.982]  Now, triple baloney there.
[01:34:48.002 --> 01:34:51.244]  First off, he states that I don't believe that there's global warming.
[01:34:51.484 --> 01:34:54.405]  He falsely makes claims that I haven't made.
[01:34:54.425 --> 01:34:55.045]  Total tactic.
[01:34:55.065 --> 01:34:56.006]  He's a smart guy.
[01:35:15.126 --> 01:35:17.528]  But he's at a disadvantage because he's pushing a lie.
[01:35:18.769 --> 01:35:20.431]  That's why it's so easy to win all these debates.
[01:35:20.451 --> 01:35:24.014]  You've got the truth, you've got a weapon that's unstoppable if you just use it.
[01:35:26.176 --> 01:35:28.077]  So first off he tries to misstate what I believe.
[01:35:28.958 --> 01:35:33.562]  Then he goes on with the second position that I don't believe it's man-made, which is true.
[01:35:35.604 --> 01:35:39.507]  And also I attacked him on the fact that they claim universal, all scientists agree, total lie.
[01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:42.823]  Then he goes, oh, but the UN report says 2000 plus.
[01:35:43.163 --> 01:35:49.309]  Turns out, almost all of them have now said, I was never even contacted, or they just added my name.
[01:35:49.429 --> 01:35:50.149]  Total lies!
[01:35:52.271 --> 01:36:01.159]  But, he then goes into... He also said that the planets were closer to the sun, that's why they were melting.
[01:36:01.199 --> 01:36:07.124]  Well, even if Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars were closer, which they're not, folks, even if they were closer,
[01:36:08.152 --> 01:36:10.393]  They were ice before, why would they be melting now?
[01:36:10.453 --> 01:36:14.255]  But see, so even if you believed his lie, it doesn't make sense.
[01:36:14.315 --> 01:36:18.457]  I mean, it's just... And then he said his book wasn't for children, it is.
[01:36:18.517 --> 01:36:20.218]  Notice he said there's also no tax.
[01:36:20.458 --> 01:36:24.480]  He says there's no tax, there's no plan for a tax, that's ridiculous.
[01:36:24.761 --> 01:36:29.283]  But then he says the taxing bit is tiny, which the whole agenda is about tax.
[01:36:29.603 --> 01:36:30.824]  So first he says there's no tax.
[01:36:32.344 --> 01:36:33.445]  Then he says, but it's tiny.
[01:36:34.105 --> 01:36:37.067]  And then he says, and it's only on oil companies and big polluters.
[01:36:37.759 --> 01:36:45.765]  And you read, it is on your oil, your gas, your coal, your car, your emission standards, everything you do.
[01:36:46.966 --> 01:36:51.249]  All these taxes are aimed right at you, the consumer, right at you, the average person.
[01:36:51.489 --> 01:36:58.114]  That's in the official proposals, globally, it's in the laws they pass in Canada, in Europe, in Japan.
[01:37:00.547 --> 01:37:02.287]  But again, triple lie, folks.
[01:37:02.307 --> 01:37:03.248]  And this is all tactics.
[01:37:03.648 --> 01:37:04.568]  Al Gore, he does it.
[01:37:04.608 --> 01:37:05.149]  Clinton does it.
[01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.689]  Bush does it.
[01:37:06.169 --> 01:37:08.190]  To catapult the propaganda, as Bush said.
[01:37:08.210 --> 01:37:09.170]  You've got to repeat it.
[01:37:09.971 --> 01:37:10.831]  They will triple lie.
[01:37:10.851 --> 01:37:16.173]  They will say, there is no amnesty, but we need this plan to be fair and equitable to the immigrants.
[01:37:17.214 --> 01:37:17.454]  See?
[01:37:17.874 --> 01:37:21.776]  Or, there is no North American Union, but we do need to integrate for our security and prosperity.
[01:37:22.616 --> 01:37:22.796]  See?
[01:37:22.956 --> 01:37:24.997]  There is no North American Union, but we need the North American Union.
[01:37:26.326 --> 01:37:27.246]  See, it doesn't exist.
[01:37:27.326 --> 01:37:28.646]  First off, it doesn't exist.
[01:37:29.167 --> 01:37:32.627]  He said twice before that clip, by the way, in earlier segments, there's no tax.
[01:37:33.067 --> 01:37:35.768]  We ought to go mine all those clips out and put them together end-to-end.
[01:37:36.028 --> 01:37:37.248]  There is no tax.
[01:37:37.788 --> 01:37:38.808]  No, there's no taxing.
[01:37:38.828 --> 01:37:41.349]  Well, the taxing part is very small, and it's only in corporations.
[01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:46.070]  I mean, literally, it's just, every word is a lie or a misrepresentation.
[01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:48.370]  It would take years to even chronicle them all.
[01:37:48.430 --> 01:37:49.090]  I mean, literally.
[01:37:49.570 --> 01:37:51.471]  Everything is just, it's unbelievable.
[01:37:52.831 --> 01:37:53.591]  The average person
[01:37:54.537 --> 01:37:57.178]  Just sits there, and they have no information, no facts.
[01:37:57.198 --> 01:38:00.639]  They look at who's the most handsome, or who looks the best, or whose voice sounds the best.
[01:38:02.379 --> 01:38:03.879]  Or who says it the most confidently.
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:05.220]  And I'm not knocking women.
[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:07.260]  Women are smart, but they're just not focused on issues.
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:09.281]  Men aren't either, but even less so with women.
[01:38:09.881 --> 01:38:10.801]  This is an average, folks.
[01:38:10.841 --> 01:38:11.661]  I'm not saying all women.
[01:38:12.282 --> 01:38:12.822]  Or all men.
[01:38:13.262 --> 01:38:15.983]  But women look at the hair, and the tie, and the suit.
[01:38:17.983 --> 01:38:20.284]  Just like Ted Bundy looked handsome, was wearing a nice suit.
[01:38:20.304 --> 01:38:21.384]  They got in the car, and they died.
[01:38:24.815 --> 01:38:26.036]  You see how that works, folks?
[01:38:27.276 --> 01:38:28.657]  You just trust on how it looks.
[01:38:28.717 --> 01:38:36.141]  Well, that Alex guy yells sometimes, oh, I think the global man-made warming's real, uh, well, there's no plant attacks and there's no North American Union.
[01:38:37.181 --> 01:38:49.888]  I mean, we've had all these big conservative magazines and newspapers write articles about me, by name, saying I'm a liar who gets on air and says there's a North American Union and slanders Bush, and they have national radio shows.
[01:38:50.615 --> 01:38:59.261]  Where they get up and pose as they're unraveling the New World Order, and they're fighting the New World Order, where they get up and say, there's no Bohemian Grove, Alex Jones is a liar, George Bush is going to save us.
[01:38:59.761 --> 01:39:00.721]  And people just buy it!
[01:39:00.761 --> 01:39:03.403]  They just buy into all of it!
[01:39:04.684 --> 01:39:05.244]  They love it!
[01:39:05.504 --> 01:39:05.865]  Great!
[01:39:09.867 --> 01:39:15.851]  Or Michael Savage, we've got to fight the New World Order by attacking Iran and Syria, and George Bush is fighting the New World Order.
[01:39:16.111 --> 01:39:17.232]  I've actually heard him say that.
[01:39:18.348 --> 01:39:19.969]  We've got to fight this New World Order.
[01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:21.771]  We've got to attack Europe.
[01:39:27.095 --> 01:39:29.076]  And we've got to go after the Middle East.
[01:39:30.738 --> 01:39:33.160]  No connection to reality.
[01:39:34.581 --> 01:39:37.343]  But see how I can play like a one minute clip and talk about it for an hour?
[01:39:37.763 --> 01:39:39.765]  I mean just analyzing each little piece.
[01:39:41.036 --> 01:39:49.200]  So, all of you out there, I mean, listen, I don't want you to keep being stupid and just trust whoever sounds the best or who delivers the best info.
[01:39:50.921 --> 01:39:54.703]  I want you to go look at it for yourselves.
[01:39:56.324 --> 01:39:59.046]  I mean, I want you to find out that Mars is melting.
[01:39:59.746 --> 01:40:04.269]  And that not just the caps, water is now coming out of the ground and precipitating.
[01:40:07.010 --> 01:40:10.492]  I want you to find out that moons of Jupiter and Saturn are melting.
[01:40:11.084 --> 01:40:20.728]  Because, again, they have moons almost the size of Earth that have large oceans, large oceans of methane and other gases, some water, some H2O in it, and they're melting.
[01:40:20.868 --> 01:40:22.229]  I mean, they're becoming liquid.
[01:40:23.410 --> 01:40:24.090]  They're heating up.
[01:40:26.031 --> 01:40:29.833]  And, no surprise, the sun's going wild right now.
[01:40:31.533 --> 01:40:34.995]  I mean, that smashes all of their global warming bull right there.
[01:40:35.595 --> 01:40:39.317]  And, by the way, the sun heating up is going to change the Earth.
[01:40:40.071 --> 01:40:43.994]  I mean, you heard Rothschild said like five times, we must have stable climate on Earth.
[01:40:44.054 --> 01:40:45.376]  There's never been stable climate.
[01:40:46.136 --> 01:40:47.017]  It's never been stable.
[01:40:47.057 --> 01:40:47.938]  It's always changing.
[01:40:48.198 --> 01:40:49.799]  That's how this planet operates.
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:52.522]  I mean, we're flying around in outer space.
[01:40:52.562 --> 01:40:56.405]  We're a giant spaceship orbiting a huge fireball.
[01:40:59.728 --> 01:41:04.912]  Routinely, comets and meteors come to the atmosphere and blow whole continents to bits.
[01:41:05.393 --> 01:41:06.614]  Then you're going to have an ice age.
[01:41:11.744 --> 01:41:12.744]  I mean, do you read me?
[01:41:12.784 --> 01:41:13.485]  Comprende?
[01:41:15.005 --> 01:41:16.166]  And I've talked to a lot of environmentalists.
[01:41:16.206 --> 01:41:19.487]  I was talking to Rob Schall during the break, and he goes, like, alright, there's questions about it all, Alex.
[01:41:19.808 --> 01:41:21.468]  I saw a lot of them saying this on the news this weekend.
[01:41:21.488 --> 01:41:24.370]  A lot of them, I think, I saw on the Live Earth Aid.
[01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:28.631]  Live Earth, they were going, well, let's just say that's not even man-made.
[01:41:28.651 --> 01:41:29.892]  The point is, we're poisoning things.
[01:41:29.912 --> 01:41:30.632]  We've got to do something.
[01:41:31.513 --> 01:41:35.394]  Well, what is the global tax of the very corporations running everything?
[01:41:35.414 --> 01:41:38.656]  I mean, they're selling this idea that the corporations are against this.
[01:41:40.046 --> 01:41:42.949]  You know, I heard Libertarians this weekend on local talk radio.
[01:41:42.969 --> 01:41:44.911]  It was a syndicated show, but on a local affiliate.
[01:41:46.332 --> 01:41:48.194]  It was all how Ayn Rand was going to save us.
[01:41:48.274 --> 01:41:50.837]  And boy, why don't these CEOs get it?
[01:41:50.877 --> 01:41:52.178]  Why doesn't Bill Gates get it?
[01:41:52.618 --> 01:41:55.621]  Why don't they understand that big government is hurting them?
[01:41:55.661 --> 01:41:57.183]  And why aren't they for capitalism?
[01:41:57.443 --> 01:41:58.624]  Well, they're just dumb.
[01:41:59.185 --> 01:42:00.226]  They just don't know.
[01:42:01.664 --> 01:42:03.046]  What do you mean they don't know?
[01:42:03.106 --> 01:42:05.129]  The big corporations want socialism.
[01:42:05.449 --> 01:42:11.357]  I've only got thousands of pages of Rand Corporation, of Carnegie Endowment Foundation.
[01:42:11.857 --> 01:42:13.259]  I mean, I literally am wallowing.
[01:42:13.339 --> 01:42:14.120]  I can't read it all.
[01:42:14.541 --> 01:42:16.984]  I'm literally up here till 2, 3 in the morning speed reading it.
[01:42:17.985 --> 01:42:18.506]  I have like
[01:42:19.742 --> 01:42:21.563]  It's got to be 500 plus quotes.
[01:42:21.583 --> 01:42:25.145]  I mean, I've got hundreds of pages of quotes from Presidents.
[01:42:25.185 --> 01:42:29.608]  I mean, I've got Presidents, Nixon saying we need world socialism.
[01:42:29.708 --> 01:42:31.990]  I mean, I've got stuff that just, I didn't even know.
[01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:33.530]  And I mean, this is bibliographed.
[01:42:33.570 --> 01:42:34.851]  I'm finding where they said it.
[01:42:36.052 --> 01:42:37.153]  You think he's conservative?
[01:42:37.353 --> 01:42:39.314]  Man, this is a big, it's worse than I thought.
[01:42:40.875 --> 01:42:44.297]  I mean, they are openly saying world socialism, folks,
[01:42:45.211 --> 01:42:57.358]  This whole Michael Moore movie about socialized health care, they give you fascist health care, scam health care, then they tell you that's free market, they demonize free market health care, then they give you socialized health care, where you will wait for a year and a half for a brain surgery.
[01:42:57.678 --> 01:42:59.399]  When you got a tumor that if they could get out you'd live.
[01:43:00.299 --> 01:43:04.021]  Where you will wait a year for a bypass, where you would have lived if you wouldn't have got it.
[01:43:05.002 --> 01:43:07.263]  Where you will, and the elites all can still get it.
[01:43:10.311 --> 01:43:15.452]  And where in your own country, like Canada, anything the government offers, other private firms aren't allowed to offer.
[01:43:15.732 --> 01:43:16.873]  I mean, folks, this is hellish!
[01:43:19.093 --> 01:43:22.934]  And they got a bunch of... You've only really got about 15 million people that are truly uninsured.
[01:43:23.454 --> 01:43:26.035]  The 44 million that are uninsured, that's a play-with number.
[01:43:26.315 --> 01:43:27.915]  I could break it all down if we had an hour here.
[01:43:28.555 --> 01:43:30.596]  Truly 14, 15 million that are uninsured.
[01:43:32.529 --> 01:43:34.370]  We could have the cities, the counties pick that up.
[01:43:34.570 --> 01:43:37.993]  They don't even know that there's already laws in place going back over a hundred years.
[01:43:38.033 --> 01:43:40.415]  I had a friend literally dying of Crohn's disease.
[01:43:40.435 --> 01:43:41.295]  He was probably going to die.
[01:43:42.936 --> 01:43:45.158]  And he was a smart guy, but he didn't know.
[01:43:45.198 --> 01:43:46.759]  My dad's a physician, so I knew this.
[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:49.801]  That you can go make them give you a surgery.
[01:43:50.101 --> 01:43:56.305]  And he had the top doctor in the country on Crohn's disease go in and do a surgery.
[01:43:56.325 --> 01:43:58.307]  And now he can eat fine, live fine, and
[01:43:59.935 --> 01:44:04.840]  Is at least semi-cured for 10 years and we have to have more intestine taken out 10 years from now.
[01:44:06.401 --> 01:44:07.563]  And he was like, no, no, no.
[01:44:07.583 --> 01:44:09.064]  They're not telling me that at the doctor's offices.
[01:44:09.344 --> 01:44:10.145]  They're not telling me all this.
[01:44:10.185 --> 01:44:12.187]  I mean, look, man, you go in, it's a charity case.
[01:44:12.207 --> 01:44:13.248]  You show how much money you make.
[01:44:14.169 --> 01:44:16.571]  You can agree to, you know, pay a fraction of it.
[01:44:16.611 --> 01:44:17.072]  You're going to get it.
[01:44:17.332 --> 01:44:19.474]  Full surgery, the equivalent of like $60,000 worth free.
[01:44:21.374 --> 01:44:25.356]  Because those doctors have to do so many charity cases.
[01:44:25.756 --> 01:44:33.199]  Now with my dad, who's a dentist, and I don't even want to say this on air because he's literally killing himself over working and giving everybody like half price and quarter price.
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:35.921]  I grew up watching this, so then everybody flocks to him.
[01:44:35.961 --> 01:44:36.901]  I shouldn't even say it on air.
[01:44:37.141 --> 01:44:40.483]  I'm trying to get... I don't want my dad killing himself working to death, folks.
[01:44:40.963 --> 01:44:44.765]  So I don't even want to plug the... Everybody will rush over there, but the fact is he's done a lot of charity.
[01:44:45.785 --> 01:44:47.226]  But that's what they're supposed to do.
[01:44:48.456 --> 01:44:49.137]  We're good to go.
[01:45:11.383 --> 01:45:12.563]  You know what, just don't believe me.
[01:45:12.603 --> 01:45:35.970]  Just believe that Jupiter is closer to the Sun than Earth, and just believe the government loves you, and believe cops telling you you can't videotape them is freedom, and just believe DU is nutritious for your lungs, and just believe mercury is good for your brain in the shots, and just, just, you know what, don't believe me that I have official Nazi documents using fluoride to make slaves in work camps more docile.
[01:45:36.810 --> 01:45:37.570]  Just don't believe it.
[01:45:37.730 --> 01:45:38.190]  Just drink it.
[01:45:39.131 --> 01:45:40.011]  Don't call Big Berkey.
[01:45:40.735 --> 01:45:42.155]  I mean, don't filter out your water.
[01:45:42.175 --> 01:45:45.616]  Just don't believe anything I say anymore.
[01:45:47.576 --> 01:45:47.976]  Period.
[01:45:49.177 --> 01:45:50.137]  Don't believe any of it.
[01:45:51.217 --> 01:45:51.957]  I'm sick of it!
[01:45:52.337 --> 01:45:56.218]  I've got so much documentation, there's not even a point for this show anymore!
[01:45:56.238 --> 01:45:58.818]  People are like, well, why are you still alive then?
[01:46:00.118 --> 01:46:03.819]  I've explained this to you over and over and over and over and over again.
[01:46:03.839 --> 01:46:08.600]  And I guess I could explain it till the cows come home.
[01:46:11.331 --> 01:46:13.194]  This is how you catch wild hogs in mass.
[01:46:13.514 --> 01:46:16.178]  If you want to have fun you ride them down on horses with guns or spears.
[01:46:16.779 --> 01:46:23.709]  The standard way to hunt them is you set up fences out in the middle of your bog or out in your field up against the edge of the woods where they'll feel safe.
[01:46:23.729 --> 01:46:26.654]  You put out a salt lick and a grain feeder.
[01:46:27.805 --> 01:46:33.367]  And it may take a few weeks and the little piglets and the stupid ones and the uninformed and the unexperienced will run in there first.
[01:46:33.867 --> 01:46:42.310]  And by the end of it you'll have 600 pound hogs, feral hogs, in there rooting it up and they'll be waiting every morning for when it goes off and they'll all run in and start eating it.
[01:46:42.630 --> 01:46:45.671]  And then after a month of it being out there you put a timer on the gate door.
[01:46:46.252 --> 01:46:49.793]  It's got to be good, tall, strong fence because they'll rampage through.
[01:46:49.833 --> 01:46:52.394]  In fact, generally you want to be out there in a truck nearby
[01:46:53.334 --> 01:46:58.816]  Waiting for the morning that they do come out and you actually close the gate because they'll rampage out and tear your fence up and get out.
[01:46:59.057 --> 01:47:00.817]  You've got to be able to run up on them and shoot them.
[01:47:01.318 --> 01:47:03.979]  You know, go up there with your semi-automatic rifle and just start blasting them.
[01:47:04.499 --> 01:47:07.900]  Don't call up stupid non-hunting people and give me some line.
[01:47:08.141 --> 01:47:13.583]  There's millions of these invasive species, I'll even use your own term, all over the country ruining fields, ruining everything.
[01:47:13.783 --> 01:47:14.944]  They eat baby deer.
[01:47:15.184 --> 01:47:17.245]  They're like, literally, tigers or something.
[01:47:17.465 --> 01:47:18.365]  They're super predators.
[01:47:18.845 --> 01:47:20.786]  They get up to 800, well in some cases 1,100 pounds, but I've never
[01:47:23.207 --> 01:47:26.990]  I think on my dad's property, one time a guy shot a 600-pound one.
[01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:29.012]  He had to get a tractor just to pick it up.
[01:47:29.052 --> 01:47:35.517]  But the point is, that's what you had to do to get rid of them.
[01:47:35.577 --> 01:47:37.338]  And that just barely controls them.
[01:47:37.718 --> 01:47:41.161]  Because they can have, what, two litters a year of upwards of 12 piglets.
[01:47:41.201 --> 01:47:42.442]  But I'm already digressing.
[01:47:42.482 --> 01:47:44.524]  I meant this to be an analogy of how they domesticate you.
[01:47:44.944 --> 01:47:46.205]  It's the same thing, okay?
[01:47:47.023 --> 01:47:52.864]  I'm a pig, running around outside the fence, telling the other piglets, you better not go in there.
[01:47:53.584 --> 01:47:54.484]  You understand that, folks?
[01:47:55.965 --> 01:47:58.325]  They don't want to scare everybody off.
[01:47:58.365 --> 01:48:00.965]  They want you in the pen, they want to close the door.
[01:48:02.126 --> 01:48:02.486]  Alright?
[01:48:03.446 --> 01:48:08.227]  And they do imprison people, and they do kill people, and they do audit people, and they do physically attack people, and they do threaten people.
[01:48:08.507 --> 01:48:10.227]  And don't think a lot of that hasn't happened to me, folks.
[01:48:12.367 --> 01:48:16.108]  But again, they don't want to kill me yet.
[01:48:16.761 --> 01:48:17.441]  You understand that?
[01:48:17.481 --> 01:48:19.002]  This is a life and death situation here.
[01:48:20.303 --> 01:48:22.865]  Because they don't want to draw too much credibility to what I'm saying.
[01:48:24.566 --> 01:48:27.007]  They don't want to give too much attention to what I'm doing.
[01:48:27.027 --> 01:48:29.628]  And I've got a feel for it.
[01:48:29.769 --> 01:48:37.193]  If I get maybe 50% bigger, as they say, more effective, reaching more people, then I enter a danger zone where you get to a certain point where they just have to kill you.
[01:48:38.333 --> 01:48:38.834]  But you know what?
[01:48:38.994 --> 01:48:41.735]  I've already said that at least I'm in control of my own destiny.
[01:48:42.016 --> 01:48:43.436]  That is, I've put it in God's hands.
[01:48:43.536 --> 01:48:44.257]  And that was a choice.
[01:48:45.006 --> 01:48:51.448]  And I made a decision to turn loose and not worry about it, and just not have fear, and just, hey, I'm going to give my life up for this, or potentially give it up.
[01:48:51.788 --> 01:48:54.748]  I am going to go 110%, folks.
[01:48:55.028 --> 01:48:58.189]  110%, because I know these are criminals we're dealing with, and I'm going to fight them.
[01:48:59.309 --> 01:49:12.673]  Or a better analogy is, a lot of times, you know, the bigger bucks won't even come to the edge of the woods until they see some doe go up to a feeder, or until they see some other deer pass, if you're hunting on a pipeline, or, you know, something like that, and you want to wait, and that little buck comes out and eats.
[01:49:13.133 --> 01:49:14.653]  You don't shoot the guy with the four-point.
[01:49:15.486 --> 01:49:23.331]  Because running across that field, because he wants to chase a doe, if he's rutting, he's going to be that big 20 point with that huge rack he's been looking for.
[01:49:24.351 --> 01:49:25.292]  You understand that, folks?
[01:49:25.312 --> 01:49:29.274]  So, you, the American people, the people of the world, are the big buck they want.
[01:49:29.913 --> 01:49:33.096]  I'm this little yearling out there with two scraggly antlers.
[01:49:33.697 --> 01:49:35.899]  And they got their sight on me, don't worry.
[01:49:36.339 --> 01:49:38.841]  They got their finger barely squeezing right on it.
[01:49:39.041 --> 01:49:40.243]  They can kill me whenever they want.
[01:49:40.663 --> 01:49:42.505]  And they're just waiting for me to get done.
[01:49:42.865 --> 01:49:43.746]  Hoping you don't listen.
[01:49:43.766 --> 01:49:44.867]  Hoping you think everything's safe.
[01:49:45.107 --> 01:49:46.568]  So you'll walk right out in front of them.
[01:49:46.728 --> 01:49:48.470]  And the minute you do, they're going to squeeze that trigger.
[01:49:48.490 --> 01:49:49.411]  They're going to squeeze it.
[01:49:56.261 --> 01:50:01.706]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.086 --> 01:50:09.733]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.413 --> 01:50:17.475]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.876 --> 01:50:29.299]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.599 --> 01:50:33.081]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.561 --> 01:50:35.501]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.822 --> 01:50:39.683]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.957 --> 01:51:03.025]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:51:03.285 --> 01:51:14.515]  Black quirky elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:14.855 --> 01:51:20.520]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:21.461]  I think so.
[01:51:38.618 --> 01:51:39.158]  Let's get it!
[01:51:53.163 --> 01:51:54.885]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:55.105 --> 01:51:58.808]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:59.128 --> 01:52:01.350]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:08.076]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:08.216 --> 01:52:13.120]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:22.326]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[01:52:22.667 --> 01:52:28.651]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[01:53:03.253 --> 01:53:07.276]  I remember when I was protesting in 1999, the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:53:29.890 --> 01:53:31.531]  In Waco, Texas.
[01:53:32.131 --> 01:53:33.011]  I've got the video of this.
[01:53:35.172 --> 01:53:36.273]  I put clips of it on the web.
[01:53:36.953 --> 01:53:42.895]  And, uh, I knew something was wrong with America when I was wearing a t-shirt and somewhat tight blue jeans, Mike Hanson was.
[01:53:43.656 --> 01:53:47.357]  There was about 500 people out there protesting, the 10 or 15 federal Klan members.
[01:53:47.417 --> 01:53:48.818]  It's now come out they were actually feds.
[01:53:49.998 --> 01:53:59.422]  And, uh, I was, uh, walking around and I looked up in the parking garage across the street from the courthouse and they had the sniper's train right on me and I started videotaping them and waving at them and
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:10.567]  The cop got off on it even more and honed, got jacked up right on the rifle and was just putting that, I mean literally, talking about hunting deer made me think of that guy.
[01:54:11.008 --> 01:54:17.032]  Imagine the power trip of having that .308 Remington 700 probably right on my head or right on my chest just sitting there.
[01:54:17.052 --> 01:54:18.333]  I mean that's the kind of person he was.
[01:54:18.393 --> 01:54:22.677]  Yeah, I got loaded .308 right on you baby.
[01:54:24.038 --> 01:54:26.059]  You don't scare me man, you're the one that lives in fear.
[01:54:28.101 --> 01:54:30.343]  You put a bullet right through my heart, that's a lot of work and
[01:54:31.261 --> 01:54:32.561]  I don't have to go through.
[01:54:32.642 --> 01:54:33.822]  I die a real man.
[01:54:33.882 --> 01:54:34.662]  I die with courage.
[01:54:35.162 --> 01:54:36.583]  I die with freedom in my heart.
[01:54:37.423 --> 01:54:38.703]  You die a slave of the devil.
[01:54:41.464 --> 01:54:42.745]  All right, we're going to start the next hour.
[01:54:42.765 --> 01:54:49.807]  I'm going to play this Ron Paul clip and we're going to get Aaron Dyches in here with part two on the whole eugenics situation because there was so much we didn't get into the other day.
[01:54:49.827 --> 01:54:53.628]  We'll have some days this week with a bunch of guests and of course some days with just your phone calls.
[01:54:55.195 --> 01:54:57.518]  I wanted to tell you about InnerFood, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:57.538 --> 01:54:59.059]  A fabulous sponsor.
[01:54:59.079 --> 01:55:00.721]  The best green food out there, bar none.
[01:55:00.741 --> 01:55:01.421]  I've been taking it.
[01:55:01.441 --> 01:55:04.144]  Aaron has been taking it here at the office.
[01:55:04.304 --> 01:55:04.784]  He loves it.
[01:55:05.145 --> 01:55:14.433]  Really been reducing his hunger because it gives you the nutrients you're missing out on this food, this processed food that most of us eat that's been debased of nutrients and never had it to begin with.
[01:55:15.254 --> 01:55:16.575]  And it's just, they're great patriots.
[01:55:16.656 --> 01:55:17.616]  Made right here in America.
[01:55:17.697 --> 01:55:18.097]  Organic.
[01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:21.041]  Just go check out all the great ingredients that are in this.
[01:55:21.141 --> 01:55:22.101]  It is a superfood.
[01:55:22.522 --> 01:55:25.443]  ENERFOOD.COM, ENERFOOD.COM, or 1-866-762-9238, 1-866-762-9238, or ENERFOOD.COM.
[01:55:25.463 --> 01:55:28.804]  It's just fabulous stuff, ladies and gentlemen, and I certainly hope that you will take very
[01:55:43.302 --> 01:55:44.323]  We're good to go!
[01:56:14.406 --> 01:56:19.307]  It has been clinically proven as an herbal registered drug in over 45 countries.
[01:56:19.367 --> 01:56:21.068]  Endorsed by over 200,000 health care professionals.
[01:56:21.388 --> 01:56:23.308]  Over 300 clinical trials and research studies.
[01:56:23.708 --> 01:56:29.830]  Approximately 2 billion tablets and 13 million syrup bottles of LIV52 are sold every year worldwide.
[01:56:29.970 --> 01:56:30.210]  LIV52.
[01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:32.651]  Incredible Detox Formula.
[01:56:32.991 --> 01:56:33.631]  ResearchHerbs.com
[01:56:34.853 --> 01:56:36.974]  Tune in to God's good creations, folks.
[01:56:37.274 --> 01:56:38.775]  It's the real natural drugs right there.
[01:56:39.275 --> 01:56:40.916]  ResearchHerbs.com.

[01:56:41.697 --> 01:56:43.317]  1-800-845-3841.
[01:56:43.758 --> 01:56:52.882]  In closing out this hour, I do hope that you listeners will remember that we've got 15 films, now really 15 and a half.
[01:56:53.142 --> 01:56:56.384]  Terror Storm, second edition, final cut is now available.
[01:56:58.275 --> 01:56:59.617]  I don't know, 15, 20 other films.
[01:56:59.657 --> 01:57:00.518]  I don't know how many.
[01:57:00.578 --> 01:57:01.179]  It's a whole bunch.
[01:57:01.599 --> 01:57:02.540]  A whole bunch of books.
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:04.823]  9-11 Inside Job t-shirts.
[01:57:04.843 --> 01:57:08.428]  9-11 Inside Job ball caps that are near cost.
[01:57:08.488 --> 01:57:10.731]  I mean, $9.95 for a shirt's costing me $5.
[01:57:10.771 --> 01:57:13.034]  $9.95 for a ball cap costing me $5. $6.
[01:57:18.057 --> 01:57:18.978]  It's meant to get out there.
[01:57:19.298 --> 01:57:20.960]  Got 9-11 inside job bracelets.
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:22.781]  We just cut the prices on those.
[01:57:23.401 --> 01:57:26.804]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:57:27.465 --> 01:57:29.406]  Third hour, straight ahead.
[01:57:33.289 --> 01:57:37.853]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.571 --> 01:57:50.231]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.892 --> 01:57:51.992]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.652 --> 01:57:53.773]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.413 --> 01:57:55.233]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.993 --> 01:57:56.894]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.914 --> 01:58:01.215]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.736 --> 01:58:05.897]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.598 --> 01:58:12.160]  We're going to end up having Aaron Dykes with a Part 2 on the Eugenics Talk that we started Friday.
[01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:13.360]  This governing system.
[01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:18.242]  And I'm going to have him back in maybe Friday with a Part 3, because this is such a big subject.
[01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:25.711]  But we'll have him in here for about 45 minutes today because I want to play this Ron Paul clip when he was on there with Stephanopoulos this weekend.
[01:58:26.191 --> 01:58:28.916]  Let's go ahead and get into this clip and I'm going to comment on it in the next segment.
[01:58:28.936 --> 01:58:29.237]  Here it is.
[01:58:30.635 --> 01:58:33.576]  It was a mistake to go, so it's a mistake to stay.
[01:58:33.596 --> 01:58:38.539]  Republican Ron Paul is the only candidate in his party against the Iraq War from the start.
[01:58:39.019 --> 01:58:44.782]  A 10-term congressman from Texas, he's also an obstetrician who's delivered more than 4,000 babies.
[01:58:45.342 --> 01:58:46.903]  Vote for the principles of freedom.
[01:58:47.123 --> 01:58:49.404]  And he was the libertarian candidate for president in 1988.
[01:58:52.285 --> 01:58:58.411]  I spoke with both men in Washington on Friday, starting with Congressman Paul, who had a nice crowd assembled on the street.
[01:59:00.533 --> 01:59:01.934]  He also came with a little news.
[01:59:02.454 --> 01:59:09.821]  After a burst of fundraising in the second quarter, he has more campaign cash on hand than the former frontrunner, John McCain.
[01:59:10.422 --> 01:59:12.764]  I think some of the candidates are on the down slope.
[01:59:13.303 --> 01:59:20.802]  We're on the upslope, so can you imagine what it would be like if we do as well in the next quarter and quadruple our income and our numbers?
[01:59:20.942 --> 01:59:21.825]  How do you account for it?
[01:59:21.865 --> 01:59:22.747]  What do you think happens?
[01:59:24.458 --> 01:59:31.724]  To simplify it, I would say I think people have underestimated the number of people in this country that are interested in a freedom message.
[01:59:31.884 --> 01:59:32.844]  Just being free.
[01:59:33.185 --> 01:59:36.147]  Free of the government, you know, oppression of us.
[01:59:36.207 --> 01:59:39.089]  Whether it's on our personal liberties, our economic liberties.
[01:59:39.429 --> 01:59:43.552]  And they certainly like the foreign policy of non-intervention.
[01:59:43.612 --> 01:59:45.974]  You know, just stay out of the internal fears of others.
[01:59:46.014 --> 01:59:48.356]  Let me get into that message of non-intervention.
[01:59:48.456 --> 01:59:49.537]  Starting with Iraq.
[01:59:49.597 --> 01:59:50.898]  You were the only candidate
[01:59:51.518 --> 01:59:56.223]  On the stage in the Republican debates who was against the war in Iraq from the very beginning.
[01:59:56.363 --> 01:59:59.206]  And you want the troops to get out right now.
[01:59:59.426 --> 02:00:02.670]  But don't we have a responsibility to those we leave behind?
[02:00:03.271 --> 02:00:06.174]  We have a lot of responsibility, but it's to the American people.
[02:00:06.594 --> 02:00:07.715]  We have it to our troops.
[02:00:08.315 --> 02:00:13.840]  We need to get them out of a bad situation, we need to get them out of harm's way, and we need to protect the American taxpayer.
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:16.963]  It's a tragedy of what's happening, what we're going to leave behind.
[02:00:17.343 --> 02:00:20.946]  But we don't know it's going to be as bad as those who are predicting bad things.
[02:00:21.006 --> 02:00:27.592]  Just remember, the people who are predicting these very, very dire things to happen are the same ones who predicted it would be a cakewalk.
[02:00:27.612 --> 02:00:29.954]  So you're willing to pay the price, even if that is the price?
[02:00:30.154 --> 02:00:37.917]  Well, it's not much of a price to save our men, and save our taxpayer, and change our foreign policy to be more sensible.
[02:00:38.237 --> 02:00:41.438]  Think of Vietnam, it worked out much better than anybody predicted.
[02:00:41.698 --> 02:00:46.720]  We're achieving with Vietnam what the founders advised us to achieve with everybody, friendship and trade.
[02:00:47.413 --> 02:00:52.517]  Not a belligerent attitude of forcing our wishes on other people.
[02:00:52.657 --> 02:00:53.517]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[02:00:53.577 --> 02:00:58.981]  I rise to urge the Congress to think twice before thrusting this nation into a war without merit.
[02:00:59.181 --> 02:01:09.448]  You started out as a very lonely voice in the Republican Party, but it seems like more Republicans are inching your way, at least towards starting, to pull out from Iraq.
[02:01:09.468 --> 02:01:15.832]  Do you believe that come next year, the Republican Party position will be, it's time to withdraw, it's time to get out?
[02:01:16.292 --> 02:01:18.935]  If they are, they won't have a prayer in the election.
[02:01:18.955 --> 02:01:21.377]  I mean, where are their political instincts?
[02:01:21.678 --> 02:01:22.839]  That's why they're starting to shift.
[02:01:23.199 --> 02:01:24.721]  I mean, we'll take them any way we can get them.
[02:01:24.981 --> 02:01:27.403]  You know, support for a more sane foreign policy.
[02:01:27.423 --> 02:01:28.925]  You would completely pull out of the Middle East.
[02:01:28.965 --> 02:01:36.272]  The main motivating factor of the hostility of this country, I've said it before, it's absolutely true, is our presence in the Middle East.
[02:01:36.372 --> 02:01:38.134]  The sooner we get out of there, the better.
[02:01:38.234 --> 02:01:41.457]  Have you ever read about the reasons they attacked us?
[02:01:41.918 --> 02:01:44.280]  They attack us because we've been over there.
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:46.742]  We've been bombing Iraq for 10 years.
[02:01:46.762 --> 02:01:48.044]  It's an extraordinary statement.
[02:01:48.064 --> 02:01:49.765]  It's someone who lived through the attack of September 11.
[02:01:50.086 --> 02:01:53.869]  That we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq.
[02:01:54.190 --> 02:01:55.431]  I don't think I've ever heard that before.
[02:01:55.891 --> 02:01:58.334]  And I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11.
[02:02:00.357 --> 02:02:02.779]  Rudy Giuliani said you didn't know what you were talking about.
[02:02:02.819 --> 02:02:07.823]  Well, that revealed a bit of lack of knowledge, to put it mildly, on his part.
[02:02:08.203 --> 02:02:09.664]  Because there's so many books.
[02:02:09.744 --> 02:02:11.526]  Our CIA defends my position.
[02:02:12.426 --> 02:02:14.448]  The 9-11 report defends my position.
[02:02:14.508 --> 02:02:16.609]  Paul Wolfowitz defends my position.
[02:02:16.730 --> 02:02:17.990]  So no regrets for what you said?
[02:02:18.231 --> 02:02:19.892]  No, but he was even demagoguing.
[02:02:19.952 --> 02:02:21.053]  Everybody saw through that.
[02:02:21.073 --> 02:02:22.254]  He was the great patriot.
[02:02:22.594 --> 02:02:24.696]  And he was trying to say, I'm blaming America.
[02:02:24.796 --> 02:02:26.297]  I'm blaming bad policy.
[02:02:26.557 --> 02:02:27.818]  I'm not blaming our victims.
[02:02:28.078 --> 02:02:30.301]  Do you think Rudy Giuliani knows better than what he said?
[02:02:31.382 --> 02:02:32.363]  He knows better now!
[02:02:33.064 --> 02:02:36.227]  Alright, we'll be right back with the last couple minutes of this.
[02:02:36.287 --> 02:02:36.908]  I'll comment on it.
[02:02:36.928 --> 02:02:37.869]  We'll get into eugenics.
[02:02:37.909 --> 02:02:38.330]  Stay with me.
[02:02:48.567 --> 02:02:51.749]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.089 --> 02:02:54.031]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.391 --> 02:03:02.036]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.717 --> 02:03:09.761]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.181 --> 02:03:21.627]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.907 --> 02:03:25.489]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.869 --> 02:03:27.830]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.150 --> 02:03:31.992]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:48.261 --> 02:03:51.023]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.303 --> 02:03:55.465]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:55.886 --> 02:03:56.726]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.026 --> 02:04:01.589]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:04.210]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:04:45.194 --> 02:04:47.576]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[02:04:48.096 --> 02:04:49.577]  After a pedicure they look great.
[02:04:49.918 --> 02:04:53.761]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[02:04:54.201 --> 02:04:56.383]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[02:04:56.823 --> 02:05:00.166]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[02:05:00.546 --> 02:05:03.008]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[02:05:03.528 --> 02:05:04.589]  What's that name again?
[02:05:04.969 --> 02:05:06.130]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[02:05:06.531 --> 02:05:07.671]  It's CalX.
[02:05:08.112 --> 02:05:09.953]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[02:05:10.293 --> 02:05:12.135]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[02:05:12.907 --> 02:05:21.529]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[02:05:21.949 --> 02:05:27.671]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[02:05:28.071 --> 02:05:39.194]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[02:05:39.853 --> 02:05:40.974]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[02:05:41.294 --> 02:05:41.955]  I'll be right back.
[02:05:42.075 --> 02:05:43.837]  I'm getting some callux for my heels.
[02:05:46.419 --> 02:05:52.444]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.065 --> 02:05:56.108]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:56.648 --> 02:06:01.333]  I'm gonna comment on this Ron Paul piece in just a few minutes.
[02:06:01.413 --> 02:06:05.036]  Let's go ahead and go back to it with this week with George Stephanopoulos, Sunday.
[02:06:06.372 --> 02:06:07.333]  He knows better now.
[02:06:07.353 --> 02:06:10.955]  I think he probably just looked at it superficially.
[02:06:10.975 --> 02:06:16.638]  He probably looked at the politics of getting the attention of hawkish type conservatives and got the applause.
[02:06:16.658 --> 02:06:18.138]  So he was probably reinforced.
[02:06:18.579 --> 02:06:27.343]  But I'll bet you the week later he wasn't nearly as reinforced because they're using different language now, the general Republican leadership on this whole issue.
[02:06:27.363 --> 02:06:32.366]  President Bush says if we retreat from Iraq, Al-Qaeda, all of its allies are going to attack us here at home.
[02:06:32.586 --> 02:06:33.727]  Well, I disagree.
[02:06:33.787 --> 02:06:44.758]  He believes that, and he believes it sincerely, but I don't think he's correct on that, because I think we have done a great service to Osama Bin Laden, inadvertently, because it's a recruiting tool for him.
[02:06:44.778 --> 02:06:45.679]  But what has happened to us?
[02:06:45.719 --> 02:06:47.441]  We have become isolated from the world.
[02:06:47.841 --> 02:06:50.424]  They charge me with, are you an isolationist?
[02:06:50.484 --> 02:06:50.644]  No.
[02:06:51.105 --> 02:06:52.666]  Isolationism is being practiced today.
[02:06:52.686 --> 02:06:54.108]  Aren't you proud of being an isolationist?
[02:06:54.628 --> 02:06:55.449]  I don't like the word.
[02:06:55.489 --> 02:06:59.833]  You'd also pull out of the United Nations, you'd pull out of the International Monetary Fund, you'd pull out of the World Bank.
[02:06:59.853 --> 02:07:02.835]  Yeah, but George Washington wasn't for all those groups either.
[02:07:03.196 --> 02:07:05.778]  We didn't have a president for that until after World War II.
[02:07:06.138 --> 02:07:07.159]  So I don't think that's isolation.
[02:07:07.179 --> 02:07:08.280]  I want to trade with people.
[02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:15.106]  We have more enemies today, and more enemies, and more enemies, and less friends than we have ever had in our country.
[02:07:15.266 --> 02:07:17.088]  You ran for president in 1988 as a libertarian.
[02:07:18.829 --> 02:07:21.735]  The Libertarian Party and the Libertarian message offers a choice.
[02:07:21.795 --> 02:07:26.224]  It offers a choice for the American people not to have to vote for the lesser of evil.
[02:07:26.424 --> 02:07:27.988]  You're running as a Republican this time.
[02:07:28.008 --> 02:07:28.068]  Why?
[02:07:29.125 --> 02:07:31.587]  Well, I was elected to Congress 10 times as a Republican.
[02:07:31.627 --> 02:07:32.527]  That's a pretty good reason.
[02:07:32.587 --> 02:07:39.011]  I've been able to deliver this constitutional, very libertarian message to my district, and they like it, and they re-elect me.
[02:07:39.611 --> 02:07:40.772]  And it's practical.
[02:07:41.493 --> 02:07:44.234]  Third parties, the laws are biased against them.
[02:07:44.314 --> 02:07:46.916]  Unless you're a billionaire, you can't even get on the ballot.
[02:07:46.956 --> 02:07:48.537]  So it's not very democratic.
[02:07:48.997 --> 02:07:54.300]  You've also really built up a reputation for living out your libertarian principles.
[02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:58.163]  You served, as you said, 20 years in Congress, but you're not going to take a congressional pension.
[02:07:58.463 --> 02:07:58.643]  Right.
[02:07:59.284 --> 02:08:03.192]  As an obstetrician, you never took Medicare or Medicaid for your patients?
[02:08:03.212 --> 02:08:03.432]  Never.
[02:08:03.993 --> 02:08:08.122]  You didn't allow your children to take student loans for college?
[02:08:09.231 --> 02:08:16.293]  No, because my goal was that they would work, and I would help them, and that it wouldn't have debt, not to borrow from the taxpayers.
[02:08:16.353 --> 02:08:17.014]  It's not the government.
[02:08:17.034 --> 02:08:17.934]  The government has nothing.
[02:08:18.334 --> 02:08:22.295]  They want to steal the credit from somebody who's trying to start a small business someplace.
[02:08:22.656 --> 02:08:29.138]  So if you steal credit out, you know, that means there's a pain and suffering for somebody that's invisible.
[02:08:29.498 --> 02:08:30.678]  So I wouldn't participate.
[02:08:30.718 --> 02:08:32.239]  I consider that an immoral act.
[02:08:32.419 --> 02:08:36.060]  Do you think the Republican Party has stayed true to its small government principles?
[02:08:37.452 --> 02:08:40.775]  They haven't stayed true to their principles about less government.
[02:08:40.835 --> 02:08:42.216]  What happened in this administration?
[02:08:42.256 --> 02:08:48.220]  They took it over, and we had massive increases in entitlements, and we have international conflict.
[02:08:48.541 --> 02:08:50.282]  So the party has lost its way.
[02:08:50.462 --> 02:08:52.264]  What's success for you in this campaign?
[02:08:52.304 --> 02:08:52.944]  What's success?
[02:08:54.565 --> 02:08:55.106]  What, a win?
[02:08:55.506 --> 02:08:56.167]  Is one the goal?
[02:08:56.187 --> 02:08:57.027]  That's not going to happen.
[02:08:59.049 --> 02:09:01.231]  Do you know for absolute?
[02:09:01.271 --> 02:09:04.613]  Are you willing to bet every cent in your pocket for that?
[02:09:04.653 --> 02:09:04.793]  Yes.
[02:09:05.134 --> 02:09:05.454]  You are?
[02:09:06.209 --> 02:09:06.489]  Okay.
[02:09:07.310 --> 02:09:09.851]  I thought so just when I ran for Congress.
[02:09:10.131 --> 02:09:12.552]  I wouldn't bet anything I could have been elected to Congress.
[02:09:13.532 --> 02:09:14.352]  The odds are great.
[02:09:14.553 --> 02:09:15.473]  The odds are difficult.
[02:09:15.933 --> 02:09:16.633]  And I know that.
[02:09:16.934 --> 02:09:22.236]  But I would say that what has happened so far is about a hundred times greater than I anticipated.
[02:09:22.476 --> 02:09:25.157]  And I think that we have surprised a lot of people already.
[02:09:25.597 --> 02:09:27.158]  And I think we're going to surprise a lot more.
[02:09:29.419 --> 02:09:32.380]  I challenged Ron Paul over a year ago to run for president.
[02:09:33.118 --> 02:09:34.259]  I know a lot of other people did.
[02:09:34.679 --> 02:09:44.626]  And Ron has said on this show, it's one of the things I'm proud of, I'm proud of you, the listeners, that in the first few months of the campaign, we, this show, raised the majority of the money.
[02:09:45.187 --> 02:09:48.749]  Since then, there's been an even bigger boost, and your giving has eclipsed that.
[02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:58.156]  But he has repeatedly said on air now that when he goes out in the public, the majority of people showing up to his events, besides his radio show, that is a testament.
[02:10:00.001 --> 02:10:07.143]  I personally, because I'm not good at asking for it, have not received one hundredth of the support Ron Paul has from this audience, but that's fine.
[02:10:07.983 --> 02:10:10.984]  People know Ron Paul is a winner.
[02:10:11.304 --> 02:10:12.824]  They know he's founding father material.
[02:10:13.344 --> 02:10:21.266]  They know that he can and could and should win, and you have gotten in behind him, and for that I'm really, really proud of you, and really, really thankful.
[02:10:21.286 --> 02:10:25.167]  I mean, the listeners of this show, and the Genesis Network as well,
[02:10:26.239 --> 02:10:30.800]  Really need to pat themselves on the back for the financial support, for the internet support, getting the word out.
[02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:36.021]  Everything you've done, I do want to commend all of you out there.
[02:10:36.261 --> 02:10:39.981]  I know a lot of it personally for you has been thankless, but that's not what it's about.
[02:10:40.021 --> 02:10:41.282]  It's about saving this country.
[02:10:41.322 --> 02:10:45.762]  Now, Stephanopoulos is an arrogant CFR, top-level New World Order minion.
[02:10:45.802 --> 02:10:47.263]  He is here to destroy America.
[02:10:47.303 --> 02:10:51.463]  He's Bill Clinton's, of course, one of his top staffers.
[02:10:51.823 --> 02:10:52.424]  Very evil.
[02:10:52.904 --> 02:10:55.204]  And he said, yeah, arrogantly, I know you're not going to win.
[02:10:55.971 --> 02:10:57.812]  Ron Paul could get the nomination.
[02:10:58.072 --> 02:10:58.392]  He may.
[02:10:59.092 --> 02:11:01.834]  Ron Paul could probably, in reality, win the election.
[02:11:02.994 --> 02:11:04.115]  They would most certainly kill him.
[02:11:04.135 --> 02:11:06.076]  And Ron Paul has said that.
[02:11:06.116 --> 02:11:08.337]  He knows that he is in danger on this show.
[02:11:09.497 --> 02:11:16.160]  And he knows that the dicer load of the game is rigged.
[02:11:17.486 --> 02:11:32.881]  But still, he can illustrate that by getting in the arena, and he can go to all these debates, and he can go to all these events and reach literally hundreds of millions of Americans, which he's now conservatively, if you add all the debates and the rest of it, he's probably reached 100 million people, at least a third of the country, that never heard of Ron Paul, has now heard of him.
[02:11:33.221 --> 02:11:35.764]  He's all over CNN, Fox, ABC News, the Internet.
[02:11:36.364 --> 02:11:38.885]  It's a phenomenon, and now people are googling the name Ron Paul.
[02:11:39.165 --> 02:11:40.625]  They're finding PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:11:40.945 --> 02:11:42.406]  They're finding InfoWars.com.
[02:11:42.746 --> 02:11:44.766]  It's a synergy, a feedback loop.
[02:11:44.786 --> 02:11:47.387]  We're all synergizing the truth movement.
[02:11:48.247 --> 02:11:52.208]  So, getting in the arena, taking action for Ron Paul, A, has been the right thing to do.
[02:11:52.388 --> 02:11:56.450]  B, they don't have Diebold in and these machines in nationwide.
[02:11:56.470 --> 02:12:01.791]  Over the weekend, he won a key New Hampshire scientific poll.
[02:12:03.391 --> 02:12:06.352]  He also got the endorsement of the National Taxpayers Union.
[02:12:07.073 --> 02:12:08.173]  Three to one in the votes.
[02:12:08.833 --> 02:12:10.674]  But he did win a key New Hampshire poll.
[02:12:11.294 --> 02:12:13.695]  He now has raised $7 million.
[02:12:13.755 --> 02:12:15.116]  It was $5 million three weeks ago.
[02:12:15.136 --> 02:12:17.317]  It's now $7 million.
[02:12:18.237 --> 02:12:25.000]  He's raised more money than John McCain, who they were telling he was the frontrunner a year ago, six months ago, three months ago, giving him nothing but total attention.
[02:12:25.856 --> 02:12:29.277]  The truth is, and Republican leadership has even admitted this, they're running losers.
[02:12:29.377 --> 02:12:51.743]  Fred Thompson only jumped in because there was no interest, and so the farce, the theater, wasn't convincing, so they brought in some better thespians, some better sideshow actors, and now Fred Thompson, the actor, who's admittedly dying of cancer, got cancer that can kill him, he's in chemotherapy right now, certainly could be dying, he'd be clear about that, in deep trouble, looks like
[02:12:52.666 --> 02:12:55.189]  He's on death's doorstep from just what it looked like a year ago.
[02:12:55.609 --> 02:12:56.250]  He's running around.
[02:12:56.290 --> 02:12:57.211]  Yeah, he's gonna run.
[02:12:57.251 --> 02:13:00.554]  People say he doesn't show up for events, acts like he's exhausted when he's giving them.
[02:13:00.734 --> 02:13:01.796]  It's not real, folks.
[02:13:02.316 --> 02:13:03.898]  It's meant to get Hillary or Obama in.
[02:13:04.138 --> 02:13:05.219]  They power share.
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:10.004]  I have the documents out of the New World Order archives from Carol Quigley and others.
[02:13:10.404 --> 02:13:13.107]  It is completely and totally staged, okay?
[02:13:13.207 --> 02:13:13.828]  Do you understand that?
[02:13:16.738 --> 02:13:19.479]  The guys that run, like Mitt Romney and Giuliani know that.
[02:13:19.499 --> 02:13:20.599]  It just boosts their name.
[02:13:20.859 --> 02:13:22.640]  They get to keep their campaign contributions.
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:24.341]  They get bigger contracts.
[02:13:24.381 --> 02:13:26.481]  He's running the Sentra deal, handing over the Texas Roads.
[02:13:26.521 --> 02:13:27.002]  Giuliani is.
[02:13:27.022 --> 02:13:30.283]  You know, Saudi Arabian lawyer for the Saudi princes.
[02:13:30.863 --> 02:13:32.904]  So it just ups their cred in the world.
[02:13:32.944 --> 02:13:34.824]  They get to go on and run for Senate or whatever.
[02:13:35.584 --> 02:13:36.905]  So, I mean, this is literal theater.
[02:13:37.265 --> 02:13:45.408]  And see, Ron Paul showed up to the theater, to the ball, to the costume party, and he's saying, okay, I'm
[02:13:47.814 --> 02:13:49.054]  I'm going to play the game.
[02:13:50.015 --> 02:13:50.935]  But he's running for real.
[02:13:51.875 --> 02:13:53.356]  And he's now surging in polls.
[02:13:53.376 --> 02:13:56.757]  Las Vegas is saying he's the only Republican that can beat a Democrat.
[02:13:57.277 --> 02:13:57.797]  Las Vegas!
[02:13:59.498 --> 02:14:00.718]  And they have to give good predictions.
[02:14:01.098 --> 02:14:05.459]  Because people subscribe and pay big money to those prediction services for the bets they're going to make.
[02:14:06.500 --> 02:14:06.800]  Okay?
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:09.080]  This is the bookies.
[02:14:11.181 --> 02:14:11.681]  Ron Paul.
[02:14:12.081 --> 02:14:14.322]  Only person that can beat that witch Hillary.
[02:14:14.822 --> 02:14:17.243]  Which is why you're not going to hear Rush Limbaugh and the rest of them pushing.
[02:14:17.771 --> 02:14:19.333]  You're going to hear them push dead horses.
[02:14:19.933 --> 02:14:24.939]  They're going to put horses in the gates next to Hillary and Obama that literally don't even have legs.
[02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:30.345]  The gates will open and there'll be these legless, fat horses waddling around on the ground.
[02:14:31.025 --> 02:14:31.746]  There's your analogy.
[02:14:32.968 --> 02:14:33.268]  Period.
[02:14:33.708 --> 02:14:34.289]  End of story.
[02:14:34.669 --> 02:14:35.150]  End of debate.
[02:14:36.425 --> 02:14:41.248]  And I listen to talk radio, and they play along with this farce, and they analyze which candidate they like more.
[02:14:41.288 --> 02:14:42.189]  And who do you like?
[02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:43.369]  Barack Obama?
[02:14:43.429 --> 02:14:44.110]  Hillary Moore?
[02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:45.330]  How do you like Mitt Romney?
[02:14:45.350 --> 02:14:46.551]  How do you like Giuliani?
[02:14:46.611 --> 02:14:50.714]  How do you like... It's like, if you're not voting for Ron Paul, you're not even in the election.
[02:14:52.335 --> 02:14:55.677]  There's nothing real in these other selected candidates.
[02:14:59.519 --> 02:15:00.319]  And that's the end of it.
[02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:06.083]  And I mean, I was in a restaurant last night with my two film editors, Aaron and Rob,
[02:15:07.060 --> 02:15:10.162]  And, uh, I was just looking at the people.
[02:15:10.302 --> 02:15:13.384]  And they all had on their own little costumes for the clique or niche they're in.
[02:15:14.284 --> 02:15:16.926]  And they were all talking, I was listening to them, they were all talking about mindless issues.
[02:15:17.386 --> 02:15:18.987]  Two tables were talking about their cars.
[02:15:19.867 --> 02:15:24.910]  Another table, uh, was, uh, talking about their job and talking trash about some employee.
[02:15:25.931 --> 02:15:29.133]  And, uh, I saw some family flapping their lips about real estate.
[02:15:29.713 --> 02:15:30.794]  Which is fine and dandy.
[02:15:32.014 --> 02:15:32.835]  But I guarantee ya,
[02:15:33.661 --> 02:15:46.170]  They didn't know anything about how the world works, nothing about the geopolitical system, nothing about fractional reserve banking, nothing about cancer viruses being put in their vaccines, nothing about how eugenicists run the planet, nothing about how they're in absolute total peril.
[02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:50.373]  And a normal behavior for me would have been to stood up and said, warning, warning, we're under attack!
[02:15:50.713 --> 02:15:52.594]  Listen to me, but see that scene is crazy now.
[02:15:53.515 --> 02:16:00.380]  I'm supposed to just go down on the ship with you, and just act like it's all normal, and act like it's all good, and just play along with all the bull.
[02:16:02.711 --> 02:16:03.311]  Well, you know what?
[02:16:03.331 --> 02:16:04.152]  I'm not going to do it anymore.
[02:16:05.292 --> 02:16:11.695]  I'm not going to play along with it anymore, and I'm not going to tell you what you want to hear, and I'm not going to hold back.
[02:16:14.776 --> 02:16:18.458]  I'm not going to hold back in what I say and the things I do.
[02:16:20.038 --> 02:16:21.079]  I'm just going to tell it like it is.
[02:16:21.819 --> 02:16:24.160]  And again, let the chips fall where they may.
[02:16:24.700 --> 02:16:28.282]  I have just made the decision that I'm in control because I'm not in control.
[02:16:28.886 --> 02:16:33.167]  I've just committed, I've turned loose, I'm not worried about how I sound or how I look.
[02:16:33.447 --> 02:16:37.588]  I just go from the gut with the info I've got and I'm just swinging.
[02:16:38.368 --> 02:16:39.148]  And I'm going 110%.
[02:16:39.188 --> 02:16:43.949]  And by that I have chosen to not be in fear.
[02:16:44.229 --> 02:16:45.429]  I have chosen to take action.
[02:16:45.789 --> 02:16:47.070]  I have chosen to go all the way.
[02:16:47.970 --> 02:16:57.612]  And so many people make the conscious decision to rationalize because they're on their way to the lottery tickets, they're on their way to the beer, they're on their way to go home and have sex or whatever is going on.
[02:16:59.065 --> 02:17:06.548]  They're on their way to go act trendy and cool, to the point of they'll watch a woman bleed to death in the grocery store aisle and take pictures of her because they are so dehumanized themselves.
[02:17:06.828 --> 02:17:10.529]  When you dehumanize somebody else, you've now dehumanized yourself.
[02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:13.730]  And I mean, that's really the key here.
[02:17:14.570 --> 02:17:16.511]  How do we put up with this war that's a total fraud?
[02:17:17.271 --> 02:17:18.692]  How do we put up with the evil that's happening?
[02:17:18.712 --> 02:17:20.032]  How do we put up with the FEMA camps in the building?
[02:17:20.833 --> 02:17:23.974]  Well, I mean, coast to coast, people are getting shot, stabbed in the street, nobody helps them.
[02:17:24.954 --> 02:17:25.794]  It's the same attitude.
[02:17:26.034 --> 02:17:27.795]  Well, let me tell you, nobody's going to help you when you're in trouble.
[02:17:28.698 --> 02:17:31.740]  So go ahead and yuppie around and giggle and smile and do your deal.
[02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:35.262]  Or your trendy, windy group, whatever niche you're in.
[02:17:35.802 --> 02:17:40.144]  And just grasp a hold of that and just hope that it'll feed your family as all this unfolds.
[02:17:40.805 --> 02:17:42.846]  We'll come back and tell you who runs the ball game when we get back.
[02:17:47.313 --> 02:17:51.820]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:52.180 --> 02:17:56.266]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:56.546 --> 02:17:57.107]  We listened.
[02:17:57.408 --> 02:18:02.395]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:18:02.675 --> 02:18:03.156]  We listened.
[02:18:03.516 --> 02:18:06.559]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:06.999 --> 02:18:07.520]  We listened.
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:12.063]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:18:12.444 --> 02:18:12.924]  We listened.
[02:18:13.264 --> 02:18:18.509]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:18:18.929 --> 02:18:20.270]  Again, we listened.
[02:18:20.651 --> 02:18:27.256]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:18:28.417 --> 02:18:31.039]  Get the Berkey Lite at the American Water Purifier.
[02:18:31.259 --> 02:18:31.460]  Only $279.

[02:18:32.140 --> 02:18:32.380]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:34.062]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:18:34.082 --> 02:18:35.042]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:44.443 --> 02:18:44.903]  Gold.
[02:18:45.244 --> 02:18:46.545]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:18:46.785 --> 02:18:52.870]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:18:53.050 --> 02:18:56.893]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:18:57.233 --> 02:18:59.115]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:18:59.175 --> 02:19:01.457]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:19:01.617 --> 02:19:08.282]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[02:19:08.302 --> 02:19:08.942]  We're good to go.
[02:19:25.708 --> 02:19:26.729]  We're good.
[02:19:44.341 --> 02:19:46.042]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:19:46.202 --> 02:19:47.543]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:19:47.703 --> 02:19:50.524]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:19:50.905 --> 02:19:53.666]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:19:54.186 --> 02:20:00.930]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:20:44.255 --> 02:20:47.359]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.

[02:20:50.462 --> 02:21:03.077]  The package contains 3 DVDs with 10 different programs, our new 658-page book called The Truth About What Really Happened to the Catholic Church After Vatican II, which is the most comprehensive book ever produced on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[02:21:03.718 --> 02:21:04.058]  I think so.
[02:21:25.857 --> 02:21:31.143]  Or you can mail in your order to us at Most Holy Family Monastery, 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, New York, 14735.

[02:21:39.813 --> 02:21:41.956]  Mostholyfamilymonastery.com
[02:21:53.860 --> 02:21:55.841]  All right, Aaron Dykes again in studio with us.
[02:21:55.861 --> 02:22:00.122]  I'm going to have him back on Friday for another full hour to really vet this out.
[02:22:00.182 --> 02:22:06.705]  In part one, we got into the founding of eugenics, how it all started, and like a minute or two, Aaron, recap that.
[02:22:06.765 --> 02:22:10.406]  And again, we're doing this because we did all this research for Endgame, and we just can't wait with this info.
[02:22:10.426 --> 02:22:11.386]  We have to get it out to you now.
[02:22:11.906 --> 02:22:13.307]  Plus, we have to condense it down in the film.
[02:22:14.316 --> 02:22:14.576]  I think so.
[02:22:37.386 --> 02:22:37.887]  Absolutely.
[02:22:37.927 --> 02:22:53.555]  We're talking about how sterilization, forced sterilization, laws about marriage, laws to selectively breed, and eugenics policies in Germany didn't arise in Germany, didn't come from Hitler and his extreme ideas.
[02:22:54.016 --> 02:22:55.076]  It came out of Britain.
[02:22:55.116 --> 02:22:55.877]  It came out of
[02:22:56.557 --> 02:22:57.758]  We're good to go.
[02:23:18.372 --> 02:23:21.395]  Heredity and change and mutation drive things.
[02:23:22.135 --> 02:23:25.318]  And his cousin, Francis Galton, ran with the ball from there.
[02:23:25.378 --> 02:23:29.982]  He seized upon that idea and wanted to apply it to mankind.
[02:23:31.023 --> 02:23:32.904]  And from there we have horrible things.
[02:23:32.944 --> 02:23:41.151]  We have eugenics, which is breeding people selectively and forcibly sterilizing people and wiping them out.
[02:23:43.391 --> 02:23:55.924]  And just studying how neurotic and control freak-like, whether it was England, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the U.S., these little neurotic twit classes were, and how they would just run around grabbing completely healthy people.
[02:23:55.944 --> 02:24:01.429]  I mean, it's bad enough to sterilize, you know, poor mentally retarded folks, who, by the way, selectively weren't even going to breed anyways.
[02:24:02.590 --> 02:24:03.992]  They would just run around doing this.
[02:24:07.699 --> 02:24:11.400]  I mean, the big picture here is most Americans, most people globally, don't know what eugenics is.
[02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:28.585]  And, number two, they don't know how then it changed into all these other things after the war, and how it is the governing system of the Club of Rome, the CFR, the New World Order, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, of course, Prince Bernhardt, and the Queen of the Netherlands.
[02:24:28.605 --> 02:24:30.125]  I mean, this is all they write about.
[02:24:30.365 --> 02:24:31.226]  This is all they say.
[02:24:31.266 --> 02:24:35.587]  Let's come to World War II, and Joseph Mengele, and his boss, and how they were protected.
[02:24:35.627 --> 02:24:36.467]  I mean, let's walk through that.
[02:24:36.887 --> 02:24:45.159]  That's right, Alex, and this isn't like 9-11, where even though the evidence doesn't add up, even though the people know, they at least still have their official story.
[02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:46.621]  This is an open secret.
[02:24:46.661 --> 02:24:47.342]  This is history.
[02:24:47.783 --> 02:24:51.408]  It's not in your history book, probably, but it's mainstream history.
[02:24:53.271 --> 02:25:10.992]  We're talking about how the Carnegie's and the Harriman's and the Rockefeller's bankrolled these scientific institutions to pursue eugenics systematically, to spread sterilization laws and marriage laws, 30 of them in the United States at the height, in about 1935, something like 25, a couple years earlier.
[02:25:14.547 --> 02:25:15.568]  That doesn't matter, keep going.
[02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:31.062]  It doesn't matter, and Hitler was inspired by Davenport, Laughlin and other directors, Madison Grant who wanted to exterminate people and wrote books on the passing of the great race which refers to the Nordic race.
[02:25:31.102 --> 02:25:36.047]  And Hitler said that was his bible, and to be clear, I don't mean it doesn't matter that they did that in 30 states, I mean 25 here, 30 at the
[02:25:38.308 --> 02:25:39.689]  It was a movement, that's the point.
[02:25:39.749 --> 02:25:45.492]  This was an entire movement of history and most of us know very little about it until we do research.
[02:25:45.592 --> 02:25:53.916]  So the war ends though, and Hitler's killed millions, the war's killed over 20 million people total just during the war, and what happens to these top Nazi eugenicists scientists?
[02:25:54.136 --> 02:25:59.319]  You know, we know about the rocket scientists and the jet scientists, but who were the British and the U.S.
[02:25:59.519 --> 02:26:00.059]  really after?
[02:26:00.652 --> 02:26:04.255]  Well, we have the Nuremberg trials where the entire world is freaked out.
[02:26:04.335 --> 02:26:10.460]  We've just found out how far eugenics has gone and all the atrocities of the Holocaust and everything.
[02:26:10.861 --> 02:26:17.006]  But behind the scenes, the British science circles are lobbying to not prosecute these scientists.
[02:26:17.026 --> 02:26:22.491]  They want to continue to collaborate with them because they've got parallel offices in their royal institutions.
[02:26:22.931 --> 02:26:25.894]  They don't want to throw these guys in jail and kill them.
[02:26:26.770 --> 02:26:28.211]  They continue to research with them.
[02:26:28.712 --> 02:26:37.660]  Guys like Otmar von Buscher, who was Mengele's boss and ran the eugenics division of Kaiser Wilhelm, was not prosecuted.
[02:26:37.700 --> 02:26:42.324]  He continued operating under, you know, the title eugenicist.
[02:26:42.565 --> 02:26:43.986]  I mean, not eugenicist, genetics.
[02:26:44.671 --> 02:26:46.052]  So, and that's the key.
[02:26:46.072 --> 02:26:53.978]  When the war ended, they stopped calling it eugenics and they called it environmentalism, they call it conservation, they call it post-human, trans-human.
[02:26:53.998 --> 02:26:57.581]  There's a bunch of these terms and they openly said, we're going to be crypto-eugenicists.
[02:26:57.961 --> 02:26:59.362]  We're going to take over society.
[02:27:00.123 --> 02:27:03.325]  The National Birth Control League becomes Planned Parenthood.
[02:27:03.345 --> 02:27:10.050]  There were some other key buzzwords where they changed the name of sustainability, the sustainability movement.
[02:27:10.490 --> 02:27:17.015]  And literally, so when you see these big environmental live-aid concerts and things, you're there because you want to save the Earth and there are some problems, there's some environmental problems.
[02:27:17.416 --> 02:27:17.836]  No, no, no.
[02:27:17.876 --> 02:27:20.798]  They're there because they want to set the precedent that man is bad.
[02:27:21.539 --> 02:27:30.066]  Yeah, it's just like out of Bilderberg this year, Jim Tucker reported that buzzword is going to be sustainability, conservatism, conservationism.
[02:27:30.106 --> 02:27:31.287]  It's the same thing out of eugenics.
[02:27:31.307 --> 02:27:32.027]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:27:32.047 --> 02:27:33.148]  It all comes out of eugenics.
[02:27:33.168 --> 02:27:33.769]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.710 --> 02:27:36.611]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.092 --> 02:27:38.613]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.594 --> 02:27:42.376]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:28:43.652 --> 02:28:56.223]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:28:57.213 --> 02:29:01.295]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[02:29:01.755 --> 02:29:10.438]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[02:29:11.239 --> 02:29:16.561]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.

[02:29:45.089 --> 02:29:49.132]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:49.352 --> 02:29:52.755]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:52.935 --> 02:29:56.658]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:56.678 --> 02:29:59.880]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:29:59.900 --> 02:30:05.425]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[02:30:05.445 --> 02:30:10.669]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[02:30:11.169 --> 02:30:15.072]  Well, going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:30:15.192 --> 02:30:16.573]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:30:16.593 --> 02:30:22.037]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:30:22.478 --> 02:30:26.941]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:27.001 --> 02:30:28.282]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:28.522 --> 02:30:32.006]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[02:31:04.805 --> 02:31:19.795]  Welcome back!
[02:31:20.655 --> 02:31:27.199]  Aaron Dykes here in studio with me and for people watching out there on the internet at a later date at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:31:32.526 --> 02:31:42.769]  The point we're trying to make here, everybody, is that we have been studying, I have been studying the New World Order for more than 15 years, on air for more than 13 now, or coming up on 13.
[02:31:43.410 --> 02:31:44.550]  I forget, I need to count it up.
[02:31:48.011 --> 02:31:53.153]  You study, you learn, you look at things, and I go off what I can prove, I go off what I can document, I go off these patterns.
[02:31:54.248 --> 02:31:56.729]  And really, I always knew eugenics was a governing force.
[02:31:56.749 --> 02:31:58.310]  I knew the elite always thought they were better than us.
[02:31:58.770 --> 02:32:03.492]  They had scientific rationales and pseudoscience excuses for killing people en masse and sterilizing.
[02:32:04.112 --> 02:32:08.094]  I knew that their great goal was to reduce 80% of the world's population.
[02:32:08.594 --> 02:32:11.115]  Ted Turner says 95% in Autobahn Magazine.
[02:32:11.936 --> 02:32:18.098]  And I knew that the eugenicists, about 110 years ago, they spawned conservation.
[02:32:18.138 --> 02:32:19.499]  They spawned environmentalism.
[02:32:19.939 --> 02:32:21.440]  They spawned all these terms.
[02:32:23.217 --> 02:32:25.578]  So it isn't like they invented those.
[02:32:25.618 --> 02:32:27.859]  People say, what do you mean in 45 they became these?
[02:32:27.879 --> 02:32:28.599]  Those were already there.
[02:32:29.139 --> 02:32:31.680]  If you go study, they all founded those, too.
[02:32:32.301 --> 02:32:34.001]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:32:34.021 --> 02:32:42.365]  And then some will say, well, you know, it is tough to say it, but we need to get rid of the infirm, and we need to get rid of the retarded, and we need to get rid of the mentally ill.
[02:32:42.385 --> 02:32:45.546]  And what would make things better in the earth is maybe they had a point.
[02:32:45.666 --> 02:32:46.086]  Oh, maybe.
[02:32:46.106 --> 02:32:48.547]  And I've heard liberals say maybe Hitler had a point.
[02:32:48.968 --> 02:32:49.948]  And he was a socialist.
[02:32:50.669 --> 02:32:53.471]  Point is, any time you try to manage and centralize it, we'll be abused.
[02:32:53.851 --> 02:32:57.713]  And the type of people that want to make the decision on who's sterilized are sickos.
[02:32:58.833 --> 02:33:02.075]  I mean, it's the same little twitly control freak types.
[02:33:02.115 --> 02:33:05.377]  I mean, I've seen them in my own life, that same look.
[02:33:05.397 --> 02:33:07.238]  Just want to punch them in the teeth.
[02:33:07.893 --> 02:33:16.820]  Look at these photos of these Nazis, and watch these films of them, and these Brits, and these Americans, and they always have their genuineness, and they all twit around, and how they're better than everybody.
[02:33:16.840 --> 02:33:22.385]  And of course, usually they go to mental institutions, they've got mental problems, they're perverts, they go to jail.
[02:33:22.405 --> 02:33:23.926]  I mean, it's a bunch of sickos.
[02:33:24.266 --> 02:33:26.328]  A normal person just wants to leave everybody alone and live their life.
[02:33:28.189 --> 02:33:31.612]  And of course, eugenics was saying we'll breed people and get super brains.
[02:33:31.692 --> 02:33:35.375]  Actually, when you breed people who are super intelligent, you tend to get mental patients out of it.
[02:33:35.395 --> 02:33:37.397]  You tend to get people who have mental disorders.
[02:33:38.455 --> 02:33:45.921]  The major studies that have come out, and this actually came out at eugenics conferences, people who were against it would stand up and show their real scientific studies that it was just average families.
[02:33:46.062 --> 02:33:49.404]  Average or even lower intelligence tend to produce the super geniuses.
[02:33:50.265 --> 02:33:53.828]  But see, another thing is everything flies in the face of what eugenics said as well.
[02:33:54.864 --> 02:34:11.388]  It is the randomness of breeding and the selection process and it is literally space rays and sunbeams and different types of radiation that are altering the DNA that are giving rise to the variety and the mutations.
[02:34:11.409 --> 02:34:17.550]  I don't want to get into some argument, that is the science of it and that's how God does it.
[02:34:18.430 --> 02:34:20.451]  But we're only beginning to understand this
[02:34:21.686 --> 02:34:28.748]  So there's a lot of, like Dr. Pianca, here at UT in Austin, he said 90% need to die and just start soon, it's going to be a great thing.
[02:34:28.968 --> 02:34:33.310]  We need a police state like China has, this is a quote, to enforce the one-child policy.
[02:34:33.330 --> 02:34:40.472]  And then his students were online and we read the graduate papers saying, well most of the class wants to kill everybody, all humans must die.
[02:34:41.192 --> 02:34:43.873]  So see, it's the perfect religion, and it's what it is, it's a religion.
[02:34:44.193 --> 02:34:47.994]  I was watching the Earth, Live Earth Aid concert this weekend,
[02:34:49.221 --> 02:34:50.201]  They had it from the Vatican.
[02:34:50.221 --> 02:34:51.001]  They had it from other places.
[02:34:51.021 --> 02:34:52.122]  They were saying it was a religion.
[02:34:52.722 --> 02:34:54.042]  I mean, this is the new religion.
[02:34:54.102 --> 02:34:55.002]  It's the religion of death.
[02:34:56.383 --> 02:34:57.683]  So we're up to World War II.
[02:34:57.703 --> 02:34:58.803]  They protect all these people.
[02:34:59.183 --> 02:35:00.004]  They bring them back here.
[02:35:00.024 --> 02:35:03.724]  They turn into crypto, what they call crypto.
[02:35:03.744 --> 02:35:05.025]  In fact, you have those documents.
[02:35:06.285 --> 02:35:07.505]  Go through those for people, Aaron.
[02:35:08.366 --> 02:35:13.107]  Go through the crypto eugenicists, how they change the names.
[02:35:13.507 --> 02:35:14.507]  You've got hundreds of documents.
[02:35:14.547 --> 02:35:15.547]  It doesn't matter if you can't find it.
[02:35:16.227 --> 02:35:18.228]  Just start going through what happened from 1945 after.
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:31.173]  That's right, we're talking about how their key buzzword, eugenics, was literally swept into a movement throughout the Western world, was ruined by everything the Nazis did, and they had to take it underground.
[02:35:31.614 --> 02:35:35.899]  They had to revoke their name of eugenicists publicly.
[02:35:35.939 --> 02:35:37.461]  They had to publicly renounce
[02:35:38.101 --> 02:35:41.945]  And then continue their work as anthropologists, as biologists.
[02:35:41.965 --> 02:35:44.167]  But then they were made the heads of the UN programs.
[02:35:44.187 --> 02:35:46.469]  They were put in chief positions everywhere.
[02:35:46.729 --> 02:35:49.311]  Kurt Volthan, the Nazi, was made UN Secretary General.
[02:35:49.531 --> 02:35:51.433]  My point is, they were put in all power positions.
[02:35:51.933 --> 02:35:52.334]  That's right.
[02:35:52.374 --> 02:35:53.154]  That's the real key.
[02:35:53.174 --> 02:36:03.824]  While there was a political hanging of the Nazi regime, behind the scenes, the scientific community kept its own, retained, and continued their programs, their genetics, and everything else.
[02:36:04.324 --> 02:36:11.348]  And of course the real technology does advance, but the key thing throughout it is the social control.
[02:36:11.868 --> 02:36:23.755]  While the geniuses really come from random breeding and nature has a mind of its own, what they really want through conservation and eugenics and selective breeding is societal control of everyone.
[02:36:23.795 --> 02:36:26.136]  That's the key, just like in Brave New World.
[02:36:26.156 --> 02:36:29.598]  And now we've learned that in the 20s they were saying they were going to herd us into tiny cities.
[02:36:30.038 --> 02:36:32.740]  What we found is that they're sticking to the same plan.
[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:38.906]  They're sticking to stuff developed at the latest 80 years ago and some of it 150 years ago.
[02:36:39.346 --> 02:36:40.948]  Hell, some of it by Malthus in 1795.
[02:36:41.409 --> 02:36:45.092]  I mean, they're just sticking to it.
[02:36:45.413 --> 02:36:53.721]  But when you think about it, Rockefeller and all these people, a lot of them were born in 1907 and stuff, so this is still new to them.
[02:36:53.761 --> 02:36:54.402]  This is their plan.
[02:36:55.097 --> 02:36:55.678]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:36:55.698 --> 02:36:59.441]  The Rockefellers just so happen to be everywhere that conservation is.
[02:36:59.841 --> 02:37:01.343]  John D. Rockefeller Jr.'
[02:37:01.323 --> 02:37:13.734]  's got his hand in Bureau of Social Hygiene, and today they're pushing HPV vaccines, quote, worldwide, which happens to be the same phrasing they used when pushing eugenics and supporting the Nazi programs.
[02:37:14.175 --> 02:37:14.535]  One less.
[02:37:14.555 --> 02:37:15.736]  A worldwide campaign.
[02:37:15.916 --> 02:37:16.156]  Yeah.
[02:37:16.176 --> 02:37:17.458]  A worldwide campaign.
[02:37:18.638 --> 02:37:22.479]  But yeah, going back to Malthus, who believed that... No, no, that's the key.
[02:37:22.599 --> 02:37:27.100]  When World War II ends, the Rockefellers increased funding of eugenics.
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:29.701]  And were so arrogant, they even kept the names eugenics.
[02:37:30.101 --> 02:37:31.222]  Okay, they're not playing games.
[02:37:31.262 --> 02:37:31.642]  Continue.
[02:37:32.482 --> 02:37:37.163]  Yeah, sterilization did not stop when eugenics became unpopular.
[02:37:37.383 --> 02:37:40.164]  By the way, I went to Margaret Sanger Elementary School when we lived in Dallas.
[02:37:40.999 --> 02:37:43.562]  They had a statue over there, and the school was like half black.
[02:37:43.582 --> 02:37:45.645]  It was a big sick joke, you know, exterminate the blacks.
[02:37:46.025 --> 02:37:52.172]  And the little black kids in there, all the kids were sitting around on the statue of Margaret Sanger, who called blacks scum who had to be killed.
[02:37:52.212 --> 02:37:52.493]  Go ahead.
[02:37:53.033 --> 02:37:55.897]  Yeah, that's right, but she had the black leaders like W.B.
[02:37:55.937 --> 02:37:58.179]  DuBois, who formed the NAACP,
[02:37:59.301 --> 02:38:03.585]  She had him in her pocket, and they were working together, and they would exchange letters.
[02:38:03.985 --> 02:38:09.811]  Let's not let the blacks find out we do want to exterminate them, and if they do, we know where to keep control.
[02:38:09.851 --> 02:38:11.052]  It's with the black pastors.
[02:38:11.472 --> 02:38:12.413]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[02:38:12.593 --> 02:38:13.174]  Find that letter.
[02:38:13.214 --> 02:38:14.275]  I forgot to do that in the voiceover.
[02:38:14.295 --> 02:38:15.416]  We've got to add that to the film.
[02:38:15.616 --> 02:38:16.197]  That is key.
[02:38:16.297 --> 02:38:16.557]  Go ahead.
[02:38:16.657 --> 02:38:17.418]  Yeah, we'll grab that.
[02:38:17.438 --> 02:38:21.242]  Of course, we'll be called al-Qaeda, or probably be called racist for saying we shouldn't kill all the blacks.
[02:38:22.299 --> 02:38:22.759]  Yeah.
[02:38:22.779 --> 02:38:23.339]  No, that's how it works.
[02:38:23.359 --> 02:38:25.480]  If you're against Arnold for being a Nazi, you're now a Nazi.
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:27.201]  I better not be in favor of that.
[02:38:27.801 --> 02:38:29.381]  Well, but you're evils because you don't want to kill him.
[02:38:29.421 --> 02:38:29.682]  Go ahead.
[02:38:30.322 --> 02:38:34.523]  Yeah, like I was saying, sterilization does not stop when eugenics becomes unpopular.
[02:38:35.564 --> 02:38:42.146]  It remains on the laws in many states in the United States until at least 1953 at a conservative number.
[02:38:42.206 --> 02:38:43.266]  It really went on until 87.
[02:38:43.326 --> 02:38:49.768]  It continues on the books, on the law, heavily promoted in Canada and Sweden until the late 70s.
[02:38:53.112 --> 02:38:55.134]  Australia, everywhere else in Europe.
[02:38:55.154 --> 02:38:57.176]  It just goes on and on.
[02:38:57.196 --> 02:39:04.063]  And folks, in between their vacations, in between their mistresses, in between buying fine art, all they do is talk about how they want to kill us.
[02:39:04.143 --> 02:39:05.244]  It's every waking minute.
[02:39:05.464 --> 02:39:06.365]  They go to conferences.
[02:39:06.405 --> 02:39:07.966]  They finance it with their own money.
[02:39:08.287 --> 02:39:09.247]  They give billions.
[02:39:09.848 --> 02:39:13.652]  Ted Turner, again, out of one side of his mouth, you've got to get rid of 95%.
[02:39:14.012 --> 02:39:17.035]  The other side, I have a special injection for the baby.
[02:39:17.893 --> 02:39:20.059]  He just... I mean, how obvious is it, Aaron?
[02:39:20.399 --> 02:39:23.247]  And then we find out these human vaccines are indeed sterilizing the women.
[02:39:24.490 --> 02:39:25.292]  These people are just...
[02:39:26.363 --> 02:39:31.708]  Yeah, the sterilization in the third world is absolutely abominable, it's hard to even wrap your head around.
[02:39:31.728 --> 02:39:32.528]  What's going on right now?
[02:39:32.729 --> 02:39:51.665]  And the Club of Rome writes about the limits of development, the limits of development, which all comes right back to Malthus, the idea of the population collapse being likely but also being planned and facilitated and led on, because when you cull off that portion of the population,
[02:39:52.285 --> 02:39:54.326]  They believe that's one of two steps.
[02:39:54.346 --> 02:39:58.629]  That's the negative eugenic side to fostering in this new super race.
[02:39:58.649 --> 02:40:00.110]  I remember in high school, I had a teacher.
[02:40:00.130 --> 02:40:04.352]  I didn't know what she was talking about, but she was a big liberal, what you'd call a liberal, really a fascist pig.
[02:40:05.193 --> 02:40:09.075]  And again, most socialists who think they are are really just a pit of hell.
[02:40:09.735 --> 02:40:14.218]  And I remember her going, oh, after the Renaissance, I mean, the Renaissance was caused because half the
[02:40:17.032 --> 02:40:18.692]  I didn't know.
[02:40:18.732 --> 02:40:19.532]  This is their religion.
[02:40:19.572 --> 02:40:21.593]  I'm sorry.
[02:40:21.613 --> 02:40:22.173]  Go ahead, Aaron.
[02:40:22.833 --> 02:40:41.676]  I'm going to switch gears just a bit and get into one of the few critics of eugenics who was also probably the first anti-vaccine activist, and that's Alfred Russell Wallace, who really has a pretty strong stake in being ahead of Darwin with the theory of evolution.
[02:40:41.696 --> 02:40:45.117]  There's been whole books written about how, of course, Darwin was this inbred twit, not even smart.
[02:40:45.137 --> 02:40:45.917]  He stole it all from him.
[02:40:46.886 --> 02:40:55.176]  Yeah, I mean, you can kind of debate whether he stole it or whether different scientists influenced who, but the point is that Alfred Russell Wallace published his findings in 1858.
[02:40:55.356 --> 02:41:00.823]  He's a middle class guy without connections and to these British... That's many years before, yeah.
[02:41:01.244 --> 02:41:03.426]  Yeah, well, it's one year before Darwin.
[02:41:03.466 --> 02:41:05.409]  He publishes a year later, conveniently.
[02:41:06.314 --> 02:41:10.616]  He must have published, I guess Darwin published another big paper five years later because I was looking at a report, but go ahead.
[02:41:10.637 --> 02:41:30.408]  I mean they all did years of work obviously, but the key origin of species was published one year after Wallace and heavily draws from Wallace and it's, you know, on one hand it's kind of a middle-class struggle because these elites kind of snub him and later when he becomes an anti-vaccine campaign he not only doesn't trust
[02:41:31.248 --> 02:41:42.812]  Governments in general, due to their influence and agendas, in pushing things like vaccines, he also thinks that the risk, in terms of science, outweigh the benefits.
[02:41:43.272 --> 02:41:44.632]  And they just scoffed at him, of course.
[02:41:45.392 --> 02:41:47.293]  And look what vaccines have done today.
[02:41:47.353 --> 02:41:48.313]  Look what they're still pushing.
[02:41:49.074 --> 02:41:51.714]  Well, actually, vaccines have caused an increase in disease.
[02:41:52.355 --> 02:41:54.995]  And we have all the graphs from Australia, the U.S., everywhere.
[02:41:55.315 --> 02:41:56.436]  And they all show the exact same thing.
[02:41:56.476 --> 02:41:57.016]  It's incredible.
[02:41:58.031 --> 02:42:08.819]  With hygiene and sewage systems being put in and rodents being reduced and fleas and ticks, really with pesticides and soaps, you see disease go like this until about 1920.
[02:42:09.099 --> 02:42:13.863]  Then when vaccines come back in, now remember, here's the high of disease.
[02:42:13.903 --> 02:42:14.443]  It goes down.
[02:42:14.523 --> 02:42:15.264]  Here's how the graph looks.
[02:42:15.284 --> 02:42:20.888]  It goes down, 1920, and then it goes back up and then planes off.
[02:42:20.928 --> 02:42:22.169]  Vaccines actually cause more.
[02:42:24.386 --> 02:42:31.734]  Yeah, and that was actually one of the arguments Wallace made, that it was sanitation and new developments in that department, which were really... No, it's just absolute fact.
[02:42:31.774 --> 02:42:32.515]  It's an absolute graph.
[02:42:32.555 --> 02:42:33.636]  There's no debating it.
[02:42:34.196 --> 02:42:35.778]  Every country, same graph, exact same one.
[02:42:36.299 --> 02:42:40.323]  Because they're all under the same British eugenics control, so they all bring this stuff in at the same time.
[02:42:40.763 --> 02:42:52.271]  Again, because they love you so much, they want to put something special in you, and the Rockefellers at the very time are spending millions, and this is in 1920's money, on how to isolate cancer viruses and how to put them into staches.
[02:42:52.411 --> 02:42:52.672]  Go ahead.
[02:42:52.912 --> 02:43:06.822]  And Alfred Wallace, who not only developed evolution on the one hand, but also pursued spirituality, and not even like Christianity, just general, there is a spirit, there's some kind of thing, he was further laughed out by the scientists
[02:43:07.262 --> 02:43:07.902]  We're good to go.
[02:43:28.567 --> 02:43:30.169]  But they immediately pursued it.
[02:43:30.229 --> 02:43:35.814]  When Galton developed eugenics, he didn't research it to find out if it's a legitimate thing.
[02:43:36.134 --> 02:43:51.188]  He embraced it in a utopian way, spread it through society, and by the time he died, Galton had a work he had been working on for ten years called Can't Say Where, which was a utopian society
[02:43:52.108 --> 02:44:08.597]  Fostered by eugenics and complete social control and he wasn't too embarrassed to publish it wanted to burn it But you could see he had tied his own ideas and beliefs into that Something that you'll see also in the Rockefellers also in HG well, I didn't destroy the elite grabbed it and are trying to implement it
[02:44:09.321 --> 02:44:09.761]  That's right.
[02:44:10.182 --> 02:44:15.004]  And then you got guys... I mean, folks, we got Wells in what you're talking about, atomic weapons that they already had?
[02:44:15.024 --> 02:44:15.004]  1915.
[02:44:15.364 --> 02:44:17.325]  Yeah, folks, they're suppressed a lot.
[02:44:17.385 --> 02:44:28.111]  He doesn't only predict the atomic weapon, he predicts a war of Axis powers of Central European versus Allies, ending their war with nuclear bombs.
[02:44:28.191 --> 02:44:36.276]  And then you get the Carol Quigley documents, where he documents how this group of British bankers, headed by the Rothschilds, literally funded Hitler.
[02:44:36.836 --> 02:44:40.318]  Then you find out it's right where they funded him to tear everything up.
[02:44:40.658 --> 02:44:42.759]  And then you've got Wells writing books about how they're going to do it.
[02:44:43.059 --> 02:44:44.360]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:54.985]  And the key to the New World Order, which is always involved with this eugenics stuff, is Wells foresaw this bomb bringing in, his story is called, When the World Was Set Free.
[02:44:55.385 --> 02:44:58.666]  It's about how after the bomb, a socialist world government comes in.
[02:44:58.686 --> 02:45:00.027]  He also does that with Things to Come.
[02:45:00.620 --> 02:45:08.168]  Where these black stealth bombers land with guys in spacesuits and bring in the one world government and enslave everyone, but it's wonderful.
[02:45:08.449 --> 02:45:17.539]  In fact, a lot of people are surely familiar with a lot of Wells' work, but I want to read some of his titles that kind of give you a hint into his belief in utopia and world government.
[02:45:18.371 --> 02:45:33.807]  And, uh, some of them are Modern Utopia, The New World Order, The Open Conspiracy, A Blueprint for World Revolution, uh, which, by the way, he advocates being silent and slow and, uh... Don't ever let them know you're doing it.
[02:45:33.827 --> 02:45:34.348]  Just be young.
[02:45:34.368 --> 02:45:35.209]  Mm-hmm.
[02:45:37.009 --> 02:45:39.071]  It's like they deny there's no North American Union.
[02:45:40.071 --> 02:45:41.772]  Saturn's closer to the sun.
[02:45:42.413 --> 02:45:50.599]  And he also has The Shape of Things to Come, which was also made into a movie, where again, he foresees a technocracy where scientists rule.
[02:45:50.659 --> 02:45:51.599]  It's not democratic.
[02:45:51.659 --> 02:45:52.680]  It's not a republic.
[02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:54.321]  It's ruled by scientists.
[02:45:54.341 --> 02:45:58.244]  And in truth, it's a bunch of pedophile old men who are completely insane.
[02:45:59.414 --> 02:46:01.536]  Running around talking about how there's scientists drinking tea all day.
[02:46:01.556 --> 02:46:03.537]  I mean, that's what we found, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:03.817 --> 02:46:05.138]  We can conclusively report to you here.
[02:46:05.418 --> 02:46:07.059]  With a complete soccer pass, run everything.
[02:46:07.099 --> 02:46:07.479]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:46:08.785 --> 02:46:10.346]  Not to distract, it's a big issue.
[02:46:11.327 --> 02:46:18.972]  On another side of the coin, Alfred E. Wiggum, who was the Protestant, he was kind of the religious side of eugenics.
[02:46:20.753 --> 02:46:32.741]  He believed, he at least claimed, that Jesus would be president of the Eugenics Society, or the Eugenics Congress, he actually called it, but he was trying to infuse... It's the opposite, he said, what you do the least of these, you do to me.
[02:46:33.541 --> 02:46:35.102]  But no, they're all about killing the weak.
[02:46:35.903 --> 02:46:37.744]  Yeah, the meek shall inherit the earth.
[02:46:38.496 --> 02:46:41.379]  So we must kill through eugenics.
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:56.056]  But yeah, Wiggum not only believed these kind of things, he wrote his New Decalogue of Science where he believed eugenics was the duty of man, that science was the duty of man, and also had a commandment about the duty of internationalism.
[02:46:56.556 --> 02:46:57.978]  So you can see this New World Order
[02:46:57.978 --> 02:46:58.138]  Yeah.
[02:47:28.470 --> 02:47:28.870]  That's true.
[02:47:28.890 --> 02:47:42.401]  In that world, a brave new world, where the society controls breeding and at best you're repressing your nature by agreeing to be a part of the society, it pops up again.
[02:47:42.441 --> 02:47:43.542]  It's the same thing they're doing.
[02:47:43.582 --> 02:47:46.804]  It's Kissinger and food is a weapon.
[02:47:47.445 --> 02:47:49.046]  It is... Well, here's the deal.
[02:47:49.973 --> 02:47:50.394]  I think so.
[02:48:07.545 --> 02:48:09.046]  Maybe even an hour and a half on Friday, Aaron.
[02:48:09.066 --> 02:48:12.207]  You've done a great job, and I really appreciate you coming in and talking to us.
[02:48:12.227 --> 02:48:18.310]  We're going to post Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 on the internet at PrisonPlanet.tv for all the folks that are out there.
[02:48:18.330 --> 02:48:26.214]  If you're watching this later on YouTube or Google Video, and you want it in higher quality, be sure and get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:48:26.234 --> 02:48:29.736]  And you also support our work here, and we're able to finance this fight here.
[02:48:29.776 --> 02:48:31.877]  We don't have the Rockefellers funding us, folks.
[02:48:32.577 --> 02:48:33.858]  We'll be right back with the final segment.
[02:48:33.878 --> 02:48:34.498]  Thank you, Aaron Dykes.
[02:48:35.935 --> 02:48:54.307]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.667 --> 02:49:02.312]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.990 --> 02:49:10.053]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.453 --> 02:49:21.878]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.178 --> 02:49:25.660]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.120 --> 02:49:28.081]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.401 --> 02:49:32.243]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:47.191 --> 02:49:48.231]  The war on terrorism.
[02:49:48.552 --> 02:49:51.333]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:51.613 --> 02:49:55.756]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:56.176 --> 02:49:57.016]  So what do you do?
[02:49:57.336 --> 02:50:01.899]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:50:02.379 --> 02:50:04.501]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:50:05.002 --> 02:50:19.715]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:50:45.632 --> 02:50:47.353]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:47.573 --> 02:50:51.276]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:50:51.596 --> 02:50:53.817]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[02:50:54.318 --> 02:51:00.542]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:51:00.682 --> 02:51:05.605]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:05.805 --> 02:51:14.751]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[02:51:15.131 --> 02:51:21.135]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[02:51:51.518 --> 02:51:52.958]  It is the final segment.
[02:51:52.998 --> 02:51:54.238]  We will have Aaron in here for Part 3.
[02:51:54.278 --> 02:51:55.559]  There will be even more detail.
[02:51:56.599 --> 02:52:00.920]  The 60s, the 70s, the 80s, the 90s, into the 2000s and the future plan.
[02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:05.241]  The problem here is we have so much documentation, so much information.
[02:52:05.261 --> 02:52:10.782]  We're going to go over all that for you on Friday with a final Part 3 here for you on the eugenics.
[02:52:12.703 --> 02:52:12.883]  Now,
[02:52:13.948 --> 02:52:35.015]  Before I end this hour and hit one or two final news items, I want to encourage everybody to get firearms, to get water filters, to try to get out of debt, to have some good friends and family, a place you can go if we do go into martial law, which I hope doesn't happen, but you need a real insurance policy, and you saw how they took the people's food, you saw how they didn't have food, or they forced them out of their homes with what happened with Katrina.
[02:52:35.075 --> 02:52:36.275]  You don't want to end up like that.
[02:52:36.695 --> 02:52:38.676]  This is an insurance policy that you can eat.
[02:52:39.718 --> 02:52:45.001]  And you don't want to have to give up all of your liberties and freedoms for a bowl of rice or a slice of bread.
[02:52:45.021 --> 02:52:53.084]  As the J. Michael Stevens Group says, efoodsdirect.com is their website or 1-800-409-5633. efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.

[02:53:09.372 --> 02:53:12.715]  They are the longest continually operating company in the U.S.
[02:53:12.735 --> 02:53:15.197]  with storable foods and other survival products.

[02:53:19.540 --> 02:53:22.923]  If you want to stay free and stay alive, you have to have food, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53:23.263 --> 02:53:24.124]  It is one of the basics.
[02:53:24.144 --> 02:53:25.365]  This stuff lasts for 10 years.

[02:54:37.843 --> 02:54:41.626]  A bunch of GOP senators, there was like two of them last week and two more over the weekend,
[02:54:42.718 --> 02:54:50.000]  Senator Domenici and others are now Representative Doolittle, very conservative out of California.
[02:54:50.020 --> 02:54:54.501]  These are mainline people and their political instincts are kicking in.
[02:54:54.541 --> 02:54:57.042]  They know it means political suicide to stay for this war.
[02:54:57.562 --> 02:54:59.803]  The word's out that the war is going as planned.
[02:54:59.943 --> 02:55:01.443]  Break it up, balkanize the nation.
[02:55:01.483 --> 02:55:03.043]  Now they're announcing they're going to break it in three parts.
[02:55:03.344 --> 02:55:06.364]  We told you that a year before the war, almost five years ago.
[02:55:07.005 --> 02:55:07.945]  I mean in 2002 we told you this.
[02:55:09.671 --> 02:55:09.991]  Okay?
[02:55:10.011 --> 02:55:11.612]  Because we had official Pentagon plans.
[02:55:11.932 --> 02:55:13.133]  People are always like, well, how do you know?
[02:55:13.193 --> 02:55:13.654]  How do you know?
[02:55:14.074 --> 02:55:15.455]  Alex Jones must be an agent.
[02:55:15.495 --> 02:55:17.196]  He always knows what's going to happen.
[02:55:17.456 --> 02:55:18.256]  They say it!
[02:55:19.117 --> 02:55:20.518]  They say it, okay?
[02:55:21.318 --> 02:55:22.319]  Hundreds of documents.
[02:55:22.839 --> 02:55:24.260]  It was all in CFR documents.
[02:55:24.280 --> 02:55:24.800]  It was all in there.
[02:55:25.001 --> 02:55:26.141]  They brag, folks.
[02:55:26.742 --> 02:55:29.724]  I mean, they said before 9-11, we're going to have terror attacks and take all your rights.
[02:55:30.764 --> 02:55:31.385]  I mean, they did it.
[02:55:32.325 --> 02:55:33.466]  They don't play games.
[02:55:34.526 --> 02:55:35.927]  They said they were going to have World War II.
[02:55:37.634 --> 02:55:38.895]  To bring in a new world order in 1915.
[02:55:39.095 --> 02:55:41.256]  They said they were going to have atomic bombs in 1915.
[02:55:41.357 --> 02:55:44.339]  I mean, these people don't play games.
[02:55:44.979 --> 02:55:46.020]  They're totally insane.
[02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:48.241]  They got 170 IQs at bare minimum.
[02:55:48.742 --> 02:55:49.902]  They're totally bloodthirsty.
[02:55:49.942 --> 02:55:50.923]  They like to kill people.
[02:55:51.663 --> 02:55:53.525]  And they're turning their cops into a bunch of demons.
[02:55:53.545 --> 02:55:54.285]  Brainwashing them.
[02:55:54.305 --> 02:55:55.326]  They're brainwashing the public.
[02:55:55.486 --> 02:55:56.687]  The public's turning into demons.
[02:55:57.027 --> 02:55:57.968]  Everything's unraveling.
[02:55:57.988 --> 02:55:59.148]  They're building huge FEMA camps.
[02:55:59.449 --> 02:56:00.229]  We gotta fight them!
[02:56:01.330 --> 02:56:03.071]  Believe me, it's worse than I even thought, folks.
[02:56:03.631 --> 02:56:05.353]  I just can't believe the things I'm discovering.
[02:56:05.453 --> 02:56:05.753]  I just...
[02:56:06.428 --> 02:56:10.990]  Mike, I just pray God protect people.
[02:56:11.010 --> 02:56:14.332]  I don't think any of us deserve it, but I love my family and I'm selfish.
[02:56:14.372 --> 02:56:15.773]  God, please protect us.
[02:56:16.093 --> 02:56:17.213]  Please help us fight the evil.
[02:56:17.634 --> 02:56:19.534]  We'll try to stand up for those who can't protect themselves.
[02:56:19.554 --> 02:56:21.235]  Alright, God bless you all.
[02:56:21.656 --> 02:56:22.456]  See you back tomorrow.
