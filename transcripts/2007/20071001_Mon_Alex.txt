[00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:10.070]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:11.531]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:13.152]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.832 --> 00:00:17.694]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:22.116]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.777 --> 00:00:34.919]  It's unbelievable.
[00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:36.940]  October 1st, 2007.
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.584]  There is now only three months left in the year 2007.
[00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:59.355]  And it is cliched, but more true than ever.
[00:00:59.655 --> 00:01:07.197]  Everybody I know says that it seems like time is accelerating, telescoping, like they've never seen before.
[00:01:07.277 --> 00:01:19.880]  Driving into the office this morning, I was listening to a local country station, and I heard the DJ talking about how he can't believe the year's almost over.
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.160]  It seems like the year just started.
[00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:26.644]  Then I changed over to a classical station, and the announcer was saying that.
[00:01:27.964 --> 00:01:32.265]  And so hence I'm here saying it, but the point is, is that where did this year go?
[00:01:33.706 --> 00:01:35.587]  Everything is accelerating.
[00:01:36.987 --> 00:01:48.671]  And that's because, like never before in human history, has actual technological development, the pace of living, the number of things that we have to keep track of, never before has it been so massive.
[00:01:50.524 --> 00:01:53.405]  Alright, we've got a huge broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:01:55.165 --> 00:02:07.929]  Latricia Majors, the mother of the little girl that got her arm broken in Southern California for dropping a piece of cake and not cleaning it up properly, will be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:15.511]  I interviewed her for about 15 minutes last night, but I didn't have enough time, so I wanted to go to calls and also interview another guest.
[00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:29.884]  But this case isn't just about them breaking her arm, it's about how they arrested another young man, a high schooler, who videotaped it, and falsely charged him, and how they falsely charged the mother when she tried to press charges.
[00:02:30.464 --> 00:02:43.927]  And it's this phenomenon of framing people, and the police thinking that they can just frame whoever they want, whenever they want, however they want, that we'll be looking at in detail coming up in the second hour, and I will open the phones so you can talk to Ms.
[00:02:43.967 --> 00:02:46.108]  Majors about what happened to her and her daughter.
[00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:49.172]  We do this about once a year.
[00:02:49.192 --> 00:02:51.093]  He's been around for decades.
[00:02:51.294 --> 00:02:57.298]  He's one of the longest fighting patriots out there.
[00:02:57.338 --> 00:02:57.878]  Lew Upton.
[00:02:58.398 --> 00:03:00.660]  He's been on the air for decades in Las Vegas.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.701]  I remember being interviewed by him in the mid-1990s.
[00:03:03.522 --> 00:03:05.203]  Lew Upton, but there's a problem.
[00:03:05.263 --> 00:03:08.565]  He's on when I'm on.
[00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:11.227]  Or his first hour is my last hour.
[00:03:11.627 --> 00:03:13.228]  So we always simulcast.
[00:03:13.248 --> 00:03:15.790]  Lew always calls up one to interview me and I'm like, but Lew, I'm
[00:03:16.758 --> 00:03:17.259]  On the air.
[00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:18.339]  Oh, let's simulcast.
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:30.169]  And so we're going to have Lew Epton on to talk about the upcoming war, the IRS, the New World Order, because he's in Las Vegas where the nine defendants just got found not guilty for tax evasion.
[00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:38.096]  More and more cases are being lost by the government as the people learn that the IRS is incorporated in Puerto Rico and Guam.
[00:03:38.116 --> 00:03:40.138]  That is just a fact.
[00:03:44.341 --> 00:03:44.902]  It's weird
[00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:52.518]  One of my employees did some tracking last week and found out that the Federal Reserve's website is secretly registered.
[00:03:53.058 --> 00:03:53.639]  It's private.
[00:03:53.999 --> 00:04:03.107]  He was able to track back who that secret registrar is, and it is the Albert... No, it wasn't the Albert Pike.
[00:04:03.347 --> 00:04:06.730]  It was the... I get them mixed up.
[00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.391]  It was the... Adam Weisshoff.
[00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:10.213]  There you go.
[00:04:10.253 --> 00:04:12.555]  Same type of leader, same group, different personage.
[00:04:17.762 --> 00:04:18.942]  The Illuminati leaders.
[00:04:19.322 --> 00:04:19.622]  Name.
[00:04:20.203 --> 00:04:21.503]  Adam Weisshop Foundation.
[00:04:22.523 --> 00:04:27.004]  So when we've actually got that, I sent that off to Paul last week to write a story on it, but he's been too busy.
[00:04:27.664 --> 00:04:32.145]  So perhaps I'll haul that data in here, maybe even have Tim pop in and talk about it.
[00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:41.947]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv are just some of the websites.
[00:04:43.726 --> 00:04:48.771]  Don't forget the new Endgame website, whatistheendgame.com or endgamethemovie.com.
[00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:53.596]  There's also links up on infowars.com over to it with all the new trailers and information.
[00:04:54.176 --> 00:05:00.062]  We'll be releasing the new official trailer, that is the professional really awesome trailer, this Thursday by the way.
[00:05:02.609 --> 00:05:11.676]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as Triamethylenes, Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:23.146]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:05:23.486 --> 00:05:28.310]  Nitrates, nitrites, Radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.670]  I think?
[00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:48.002]  We're good.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.743]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:06:08.083 --> 00:06:10.005]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:10.385 --> 00:06:18.012]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.706 --> 00:06:25.770]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:37.556]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.896 --> 00:06:41.458]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:43.800]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.982]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:02.208 --> 00:07:03.269]  The Digestive Tract.
[00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:06.590]  A natural waste factory built within all of our bodies.
[00:07:06.991 --> 00:07:11.973]  Roughly 25 feet of tunnels designed to absorb nutrition and then dispel the waste.
[00:07:12.393 --> 00:07:14.254]  But what happens when the waste gets clogged up?
[00:07:14.998 --> 00:07:22.002]  More than 4 million Americans have frequent constipation, accounting for 2.5 million physician visits a year.
[00:07:22.462 --> 00:07:27.405]  Now there's AlloCleanse, an all-natural formula based on herbs and safe enzymes.
[00:07:27.726 --> 00:07:33.089]  AlloCleanse gently sweeps the entire digestive tract and supports comfortable regular bathroom habits.
[00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:39.573]  You'll feel lighter, and you'll feel clean inside, and when you remove the waste buildup with AlloCleanse, you'll have more energy.
[00:07:39.853 --> 00:07:43.455]  Energy to use on other things, besides worrying about constipation.
[00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:48.797]  For a risk-free trial of Allocleanse, call 1-800-890-3525.
[00:07:49.017 --> 00:07:52.421]  Call in now to find out how you can get two free gifts with your order.
[00:07:52.581 --> 00:07:54.884]  Try Allocleanse risk-free by calling 1-800-890-3525.
[00:07:54.904 --> 00:07:55.124]  That's 1-800-890-3525.
[00:08:02.365 --> 00:08:04.567]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:05.148 --> 00:08:07.930]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.561]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:46.284]  It is Monday, October 1st, 2007.
[00:08:46.324 --> 00:08:54.851]  We have Lew Epton simulcasting on his Las Vegas radio station he's on in the third hour and of course
[00:08:56.014 --> 00:09:05.680]  Latricia Majors, whose daughter had her arm broken and was assaulted, and now she's being charged with battery, the mother's being charged with battery, and it's an example of massive frame-ups.
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.102]  That is coming up in the second hour today.
[00:09:11.324 --> 00:09:22.411]  In the meantime, we have huge financial developments, we have gigantic world taxation slash neo-feudalism,
[00:09:26.545 --> 00:09:27.466]  That's what it's going to be.
[00:09:30.027 --> 00:09:36.251]  We have tons of vital information to cover.
[00:09:36.891 --> 00:09:40.373]  We also have this wife of a New York bigwig.
[00:09:41.394 --> 00:09:48.198]  Her whole family are city officials, union heads, police.
[00:09:49.609 --> 00:09:51.850]  And it looks like they killed her in her cell.
[00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:52.991]  Of course, they'll whitewash it.
[00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:54.372]  Doesn't matter how powerful she is.
[00:09:55.232 --> 00:09:57.293]  She choked herself with her handcuffs.
[00:09:58.134 --> 00:10:03.517]  And the cops are admitting that they jumped on her and stomped on her and did their number on the little lady.
[00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:06.978]  After she threw a fit.
[00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:09.600]  And no doubt she threw a fit.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.901]  I mean, she's one of these bigwigs.
[00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:11.161]  They do.
[00:10:11.201 --> 00:10:11.881]  They throw fits.
[00:10:12.802 --> 00:10:15.223]  And more and more, they're getting caught in their own snares.
[00:10:17.268 --> 00:10:24.014]  But too bad for her because they 90 plus percent chance beat the little lady to death.
[00:10:27.817 --> 00:10:29.939]  But they've got the special coroner on the job.
[00:10:29.999 --> 00:10:31.240]  I'm sure he'll say everything's fine.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:40.548]  Kind of like people who get shotgun twice in the back of the head or get machine gun and cut their arms and legs off and burn themselves in gasoline and throw themselves in a landfill.
[00:10:40.568 --> 00:10:43.991]  It would be ruled suicide by Fannie Malick in Arkansas.
[00:10:46.016 --> 00:11:00.811]  Or you can get, uh, Gary Webb shoots himself twice in the head, and then people in our supposed-to-own movement come out and say, oh, that's very normal, that's normal.
[00:11:00.831 --> 00:11:04.355]  Of course, we interviewed a lot of cops on air who said that's not normal, that's very rare.
[00:11:05.176 --> 00:11:07.138]  They claim he blew his own jaw off, and then
[00:11:09.696 --> 00:11:12.438]  Took the .357 and shot himself again.
[00:11:12.478 --> 00:11:19.842]  I mean, let me just tell you, if I get found with four, five, or two bullet holes in me, back of the head, if I get found with one bullet hole, I didn't commit suicide.
[00:11:20.182 --> 00:11:21.483]  I love life.
[00:11:22.103 --> 00:11:23.704]  I want that on record.
[00:11:25.445 --> 00:11:36.532]  Kind of like the cop of the year in Oklahoma for the Oklahoma City bombing, Terrence Yakey, first officer to respond,
[00:11:37.569 --> 00:11:38.570]  He saw B.A.T.F.
[00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.471]  within seconds in their full bomb gear.
[00:11:41.232 --> 00:11:43.033]  He said, why are you already dressed up here?
[00:11:43.073 --> 00:11:44.134]  Why are you already here?
[00:11:44.154 --> 00:11:48.777]  Because he was rolling in a patrol car when it went off just two blocks away.
[00:11:49.177 --> 00:11:50.838]  They said, oh, we were here for a drill.
[00:11:50.898 --> 00:11:52.820]  We got word not to be here.
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.461]  We got word to be dressed up and ready.
[00:11:55.722 --> 00:11:58.203]  Then he talked to one of the local doctors they also murdered.
[00:11:58.944 --> 00:12:00.865]  And the doc was saying, yeah, the B.A.T.F.
[00:12:00.885 --> 00:12:04.347]  was ordering me to bandage them up and claim that they'd been in the building when they weren't.
[00:12:04.367 --> 00:12:04.908]  I told him no.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.343]  So they took that officer, even called his partner instead of being followed by feds.
[00:12:10.044 --> 00:12:11.084]  They took him out in the field.
[00:12:11.825 --> 00:12:13.266]  They stabbed him 13 times.
[00:12:13.306 --> 00:12:14.027]  They tortured him.
[00:12:14.387 --> 00:12:15.648]  He had handcuff marks on him.
[00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:18.050]  They beat him up and down his body.
[00:12:19.011 --> 00:12:20.932]  And they shot him in the back of the head.
[00:12:20.952 --> 00:12:25.156]  And they said, Oh, he committed suicide.
[00:12:27.738 --> 00:12:28.999]  There's no end to these people.
[00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:30.460]  There's no end to them.
[00:12:33.123 --> 00:12:39.067]  Pammy Malik went too far though, cutting your arms and legs off and putting yourself in a landfill.
[00:12:39.567 --> 00:12:46.592]  It's hard to do for high school educated, public school educated folks like me out there who haven't been rehabilitated yet to use your brains.
[00:12:47.073 --> 00:12:47.973]  That's impossible.
[00:12:48.514 --> 00:12:51.896]  You can't cut your arms and legs, oh I forgot, your own head off.
[00:12:55.485 --> 00:12:57.528]  It was in one of those three Bill Clinton documentaries.
[00:12:57.548 --> 00:12:58.289]  People always ask me.
[00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:00.171]  That's like 12 years ago now.
[00:13:00.191 --> 00:13:01.873]  It was in the Clinton Chronicles.
[00:13:01.913 --> 00:13:04.035]  It was in one of the others put out by Jeremiah Films.
[00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:07.079]  I aired it on TV.
[00:13:07.099 --> 00:13:08.100]  I've seen it like 10 times.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.901]  I forget which one.
[00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:11.064]  And it was in Arkansas News.
[00:13:11.084 --> 00:13:12.826]  I've done all those interviews in Arkansas.
[00:13:12.846 --> 00:13:15.289]  That was a private detective they did that to.
[00:13:17.119 --> 00:13:23.642]  There was another cop, they shot the car more than a hundred times and machine-gunned it, and he fell out dead and they said that was a suicide.
[00:13:24.042 --> 00:13:25.282]  There was a bunch of those.
[00:13:25.723 --> 00:13:31.825]  There was a string of them with double-tap shotgun blasts to the head, using birdshot, so there's no ballistics.
[00:13:31.865 --> 00:13:34.246]  It just turns the head into sloppy Joes.
[00:13:34.266 --> 00:13:38.168]  Alright, I'm already digressing.
[00:13:38.188 --> 00:13:46.091]  The point is, 90% chance, and I normally say 99 they killed her, beat her to death,
[00:13:47.515 --> 00:13:48.456]  Too bad it's an airport.
[00:13:48.476 --> 00:13:56.300]  She's already gone through security or they dropped a little derringer on her claiming she had a gun and that's the normal MO.
[00:13:57.221 --> 00:14:06.406]  But, uh, it is reported that she was on some type of medication, so.
[00:14:07.087 --> 00:14:15.312]  Now, we don't know if that's even true, but the reason they probably killed her is the fact they're claiming she choked herself with her own handcuffs.
[00:14:16.605 --> 00:14:21.849]  I mean, I've been in handcuffs a few times, and it's just not how it works, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:25.532]  She quote, got hung up in her own handcuffs.
[00:14:26.253 --> 00:14:29.656]  But they beat the daylights out of her in front of witnesses, so they're having to admit to that.
[00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:32.098]  The jumping on the head with the knee.
[00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:35.200]  Hey, you're a 230 pound cop!
[00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:38.203]  When you jump on somebody's neck with your knee,
[00:14:39.818 --> 00:14:41.899]  Like we got so much video of it, it's a favorite move.
[00:14:42.159 --> 00:14:44.860]  A lot of times it breaks people's necks, man!
[00:14:45.241 --> 00:14:46.521]  What do you think you're doing?
[00:14:46.781 --> 00:14:47.942]  You're a big man!
[00:14:48.942 --> 00:14:50.863]  That's why you kill so many people!
[00:14:50.883 --> 00:14:55.766]  You didn't like the movies where people get in a street fight and it goes on for 30 minutes.
[00:14:56.366 --> 00:15:02.209]  In a real fight with big men slugging it out, people start dying in less than a minute and a half.
[00:15:09.941 --> 00:15:20.564]  I mean, you've got sissy fights, I guess, where people hit each other and posture and stuff, but when two people really go at it, full bore, people start dying, they start going into comas, they start going to hospitals.
[00:15:20.924 --> 00:15:22.564]  I've been in the hospital fighting, folks.
[00:15:23.084 --> 00:15:25.985]  I've not been able to get out of bed for three days with a concussion so bad.
[00:15:26.285 --> 00:15:28.986]  I've had a bone sticking out of my leg.
[00:15:33.107 --> 00:15:36.168]  And you start doing that to little women, they're gonna die.
[00:15:41.676 --> 00:15:42.296]  You bet, folks.
[00:15:42.356 --> 00:15:43.956]  I've dished it out, and I've sure taken it.
[00:15:44.737 --> 00:15:47.077]  That's why I have no desire to ever get another fight.
[00:15:47.097 --> 00:15:55.938]  Because you can be a real tough guy, even when bullies start fights with you, if that bully doesn't know how to open a full can.
[00:15:56.919 --> 00:16:02.920]  But when somebody opens up a can, and the other person opens up a can, people start dying.
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.820]  Alright, I'm already digressing.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.641]  I just am so shocked by people don't know how fragile the human body is.
[00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:16.649]  Alright.
[00:16:21.232 --> 00:16:33.360]  Let me get into this first piece of news now, and then I will get into all the economic news and take some of your phone calls.
[00:16:36.502 --> 00:16:41.446]  I'm not going to spend all day on this, but it was deeply touching.
[00:16:41.466 --> 00:16:43.447]  It was extremely poignant.
[00:16:46.056 --> 00:17:03.550]  And it was an analogy, an analogous, a parallel, an omen, a window into life on this planet and the behavior of mammals, the mammalian family.
[00:17:05.331 --> 00:17:12.337]  I think whales are beautiful, majestic, magical creatures and show the particular handiwork of God.
[00:17:15.578 --> 00:17:19.280]  I understand it's the culture of the Norwegians and the Inuits and people to hunt them.
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.341]  And if it's done in small little tribal hunts, that's one thing.
[00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:29.424]  But separate from that, I do believe whaling should be banned because they have been decimated.
[00:17:29.484 --> 00:17:30.705]  They are still decimated.
[00:17:34.546 --> 00:17:44.811]  And when you look into the eyes of a whale, you can see that they are extremely sentient, extremely intelligent.
[00:17:45.405 --> 00:17:50.729]  And their songs are more complex than human speech, more varied.
[00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:58.695]  Their brains, per capita, not just for their size, are much larger than ours.
[00:17:58.755 --> 00:18:00.616]  Dolphins' brains are much larger than ours.
[00:18:01.237 --> 00:18:05.560]  There is no doubt there is extreme intelligence there.
[00:18:10.063 --> 00:18:12.525]  There's no doubt there's extreme intelligence in the
[00:18:17.386 --> 00:18:21.348]  Pachyderms, the elephants, both the African and the Indian elephant.
[00:18:23.608 --> 00:18:25.589]  And I don't think elephants should be hunted.
[00:18:26.229 --> 00:18:33.832]  Obviously, though, when they start encroaching on people's plantings and attacking villages, which they do do, they need to be dealt with to be taught to stay back.
[00:18:33.872 --> 00:18:43.756]  But other than that, because human life is even more precious, these more advanced higher species, the great apes, shouldn't be hunted.
[00:18:44.534 --> 00:18:47.115]  The chimpanzee, the orangutan, shouldn't be hunted.
[00:18:47.415 --> 00:18:48.056]  We know that.
[00:18:48.096 --> 00:18:49.296]  They're too much like us.
[00:18:50.357 --> 00:18:51.537]  They feel too much pain.
[00:18:51.557 --> 00:18:52.698]  They feel too much sorrow.
[00:18:53.438 --> 00:18:55.679]  They... I'll just say it.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.142]  I feel like, I feel like, looking into their eyes, they have souls.
[00:19:01.882 --> 00:19:05.043]  And I'm not going to get into some debate about do animals have souls versus humans.
[00:19:05.744 --> 00:19:07.785]  I, in my gut, think they have souls.
[00:19:07.865 --> 00:19:08.685]  I know they have souls.
[00:19:11.357 --> 00:19:25.184]  And I'm sure that there's some type of soul or energy, and we even have a bug, but I mean they have a lot of medicine, a lot of soul, to use the term of a Native American.
[00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:32.368]  And to kill them, it's just, not from an infantile, petty point of view,
[00:19:36.294 --> 00:19:43.299]  Or where you see humanity in your dog, but from a study of it, I think it's really a bad thing.
[00:19:43.319 --> 00:19:45.080]  But that's not why I brought this up.
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.262]  When we get back, I mentioned it yesterday, but didn't have time to get into it.
[00:19:48.762 --> 00:19:55.586]  I saw the most horrible footage I've ever seen on television yesterday.
[00:19:55.606 --> 00:19:57.547]  When we get back, I'll get into it.
[00:20:02.236 --> 00:20:07.479]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:20:07.619 --> 00:20:15.702]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:20:15.963 --> 00:20:23.006]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:24.107]  We're good to go!
[00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.690]  We're good.
[00:21:01.943 --> 00:21:05.587]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:21:05.867 --> 00:21:09.390]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[00:22:03.217 --> 00:22:05.259]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:14.829]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:15.269 --> 00:22:22.457]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:23.186 --> 00:22:28.671]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:02.496 --> 00:23:04.337]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:04.477 --> 00:23:09.661]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:11.182]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:23:11.442 --> 00:23:19.607]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:19.827 --> 00:23:25.630]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:25.751 --> 00:23:27.492]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:23:27.592 --> 00:23:29.693]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:23:29.873 --> 00:23:34.100]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.444]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:23:36.524 --> 00:23:43.876]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:23:44.938 --> 00:23:47.719]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.081]  Welcome back.
[00:24:36.201 --> 00:24:36.642]  Alright.
[00:25:02.708 --> 00:25:08.532]  Bottom line, as societies degenerate and unravel, they become corrupt and they rarely ever emerge from that.
[00:25:09.112 --> 00:25:11.974]  You end up living in a third world cesspool of corruption.
[00:25:15.176 --> 00:25:19.319]  And that's what we have now begun to enter into.
[00:25:19.519 --> 00:25:20.480]  Very, very sad.
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.143]  Alright, let me get back to last night.
[00:25:24.983 --> 00:25:26.984]  It is the last break of the show.
[00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:27.525]  It's like 5.43.
[00:25:30.257 --> 00:25:49.577]  And I walk, I get up and walk around during the breaks, and I get up, I walk into the control room where the board operator and the person answering the phones are, and up on the screen I see two gray whales
[00:25:50.732 --> 00:26:00.635]  Being with killer whales, giant, muscular killer whales, much larger, much more graceful than killer whales that are kept in those tiny tanks at SeaWorld.
[00:26:02.675 --> 00:26:05.236]  And I immediately said, look, because they weren't watching the television.
[00:26:05.256 --> 00:26:06.316]  They got a bunch of televisions on.
[00:26:06.336 --> 00:26:06.916]  It's a newsroom.
[00:26:06.936 --> 00:26:10.577]  There's like, I think 10 televisions or more than that.
[00:26:10.597 --> 00:26:12.538]  They're just everywhere with different channels.
[00:26:13.758 --> 00:26:13.878]  And
[00:26:15.123 --> 00:26:18.204]  Because it's like the third largest news station in the state.
[00:26:18.224 --> 00:26:19.384]  But I'm digressing.
[00:26:19.844 --> 00:26:21.445]  So they got news feeds everywhere.
[00:26:22.025 --> 00:26:23.025]  And it was Animal Planet.
[00:26:23.505 --> 00:26:26.146]  And it was these killer whales.
[00:26:26.206 --> 00:26:30.607]  And I immediately said, because I know killer whales eat larger whales and mainly kill their calves, their babies.
[00:26:31.127 --> 00:26:32.208]  I said, turn that up.
[00:26:32.328 --> 00:26:35.028]  They're killing those whales.
[00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:42.170]  And I've seen killer whales attack great whites and eat them.
[00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.631]  I've seen them eat seals.
[00:26:43.671 --> 00:26:44.371]  I've seen all that.
[00:26:45.157 --> 00:26:46.818]  But this was shot in high def.
[00:26:47.779 --> 00:26:51.722]  They were zooming right in with the cameras, right on the whale's horrified eye.
[00:26:52.263 --> 00:26:55.005]  They were shooting it off of a platform on a large boat.
[00:26:55.025 --> 00:26:56.746]  You can tell that because they were up above the whales.
[00:26:58.067 --> 00:26:59.228]  They were right up on them.
[00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.672]  And it wasn't driving the killers off because, you know, once they start, it's a frenzy.
[00:27:04.713 --> 00:27:05.413]  It's like wolves.
[00:27:06.174 --> 00:27:07.595]  There's about six huge
[00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:15.276]  The killer whales, and there's this giant gray whale, it's almost as big as a blue whale, and the calf was almost as big as the killer whales.
[00:27:16.397 --> 00:27:24.204]  And in three minutes, I almost didn't make it back on the show as I was watching this, it went through several hours.
[00:27:25.104 --> 00:27:34.012]  And they run the mother and her calf, they're chasing her, the calf's staying under her, and every time it comes up to try to get a breath, the killers come in to cut it off.
[00:27:35.407 --> 00:27:36.888]  And to get it away from her.
[00:27:36.948 --> 00:27:38.149]  Finally it's exhausted.
[00:27:38.529 --> 00:27:40.371]  You can see the mother's horrified look.
[00:27:40.391 --> 00:27:41.351]  Her eyes looking around.
[00:27:41.632 --> 00:27:45.214]  She goes up under the calf and is lifting it up out of the water.
[00:27:45.234 --> 00:27:48.697]  The killers are jumping across, knocking the baby back off of her.
[00:27:49.697 --> 00:27:53.440]  And of course you start having, you know, you're associating with your own children.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.562]  This is a mammal having its baby murdered by other mammals.
[00:27:58.384 --> 00:27:59.885]  And this is what they do.
[00:27:59.945 --> 00:28:00.785]  It's the natural order.
[00:28:01.886 --> 00:28:04.208]  And they end up getting the calf.
[00:28:05.282 --> 00:28:06.063]  It's exhausted.
[00:28:06.103 --> 00:28:07.323]  The mother tries to fight them off.
[00:28:07.343 --> 00:28:07.704]  They can't.
[00:28:07.744 --> 00:28:09.225]  They drag it away and rip it to shreds.
[00:28:09.265 --> 00:28:13.467]  And they also have fun with it, torturing it and ripping its guts out and enjoying themselves.
[00:28:15.528 --> 00:28:18.250]  Because predators like to torture what they eat.
[00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:19.831]  It's part of the game.
[00:28:19.851 --> 00:28:20.632]  It's part of the fun.
[00:28:21.132 --> 00:28:22.413]  And then they all had a big meal.
[00:28:22.653 --> 00:28:25.455]  And then a whole pod of killers come in and lavish themselves.
[00:28:27.256 --> 00:28:28.256]  And the mother goes off.
[00:28:28.997 --> 00:28:29.137]  Now!
[00:28:30.131 --> 00:28:31.532]  That's how the world works.
[00:28:31.672 --> 00:28:33.814]  That's how it truly operates.
[00:28:33.854 --> 00:28:35.255]  That's how it operated in Rome.
[00:28:35.736 --> 00:28:37.297]  That's how it operated in Greece.
[00:28:37.617 --> 00:28:39.559]  That's how it operated in Soviet Russia.
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:51.069]  And so we created a quote free society where we fiercely defended liberty and we set up government to only protect our liberty and to be divided against itself to stop that from happening.
[00:28:51.562 --> 00:28:58.208]  That's why somebody 150 years ago, 200 years ago, if you tried to tax them or shove them around or boss them, they'd get violent.
[00:28:58.628 --> 00:29:05.314]  Not because they were uppity, but because they realized how dangerous it was to be oppressed, to be brought into bondage.
[00:29:06.035 --> 00:29:11.820]  And they were ready to fight, and so we had liberty the likes of which the planet's never seen, at least for a larger segment of society.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.282]  There were other ills and problems going on as well.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:30.726]  Now we have fat, dumb, arrogant, know-it-all, full-of-themselves population who thinks they have all the answers and they don't know... I mean, at least that great whale knew it was in trouble.
[00:29:31.227 --> 00:29:32.187]  It did everything it could.
[00:29:35.668 --> 00:29:36.129]  Let's see.
[00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.871]  When we get back, I'm going to go over my whale analogy.
[00:29:41.871 --> 00:29:43.252]  I've used a whale analogy before.
[00:29:43.272 --> 00:29:44.072]  This is a different one.
[00:29:44.712 --> 00:29:45.593]  This is what we face.
[00:29:52.196 --> 00:29:55.200]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.122 --> 00:29:58.825]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.384 --> 00:30:06.666]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:30:06.906 --> 00:30:11.807]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:11.987 --> 00:30:13.328]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:30:13.508 --> 00:30:16.869]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:32:02.153 --> 00:32:04.694]  Hemp, the superfood for you and your family.
[00:32:05.094 --> 00:32:08.376]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[00:32:08.856 --> 00:32:12.278]  Hemp, used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[00:32:12.618 --> 00:32:19.701]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[00:32:20.061 --> 00:32:23.325]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[00:32:23.585 --> 00:32:27.449]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.

[00:33:26.861 --> 00:33:42.952]  What so upset me about that footage, why I had so much empathy for the baby whale, and then of course the mother, was, again, it was shot in high def, you could tell it was shot on like a $100,000 camera.
[00:33:44.673 --> 00:33:48.856]  Different angles, they were zooming right in on her eye, looking with horror.
[00:33:49.576 --> 00:33:53.759]  You could see the killer whales, uh, just enjoying themselves.
[00:33:54.756 --> 00:34:19.797]  Cutting the baby away, the mother, once it was exhausted, literally ramming into the killer whales and getting her baby, and then with it on top of her body, out of the water, and it was fully a third the size she was, it was gigantic, holding it up, and you see her struggling with her flippers out, trying to hold the baby up, and the killer whales just knocking the baby off, and then killing it.
[00:34:21.218 --> 00:34:23.620]  It was that struggle that I identified with.
[00:34:24.554 --> 00:34:29.699]  And that big blue eye of that whale just in absolute horror.
[00:34:32.622 --> 00:34:33.323]  It was a mother!
[00:34:34.644 --> 00:34:42.852]  Just like a human being surrounded by killers who were there to literally eat her baby in front of her.
[00:34:45.037 --> 00:34:57.728]  And the difference between that whale and the general public is, the general public thinks wolves, thinks killer whales, thinks... Because in human systems, at least for the last 6,000 years, we have warred with each other.
[00:34:58.289 --> 00:35:02.793]  The only predator to man, the only thing that threatens man is man itself.
[00:35:03.353 --> 00:35:04.674]  And humans are predators.
[00:35:05.535 --> 00:35:08.277]  Omnivore, hunter-gathering predators.
[00:35:09.438 --> 00:35:11.120]  Very intelligent, super violent.
[00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:12.530]  Pack animals.
[00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:17.053]  And I'm not saying we're animals in the sense, but that's our basic modus operandi.
[00:35:19.274 --> 00:35:30.602]  And instead of running a group of bison off a cliff, or a group of elephants, or a group of other herbivores, or instead of
[00:35:32.262 --> 00:35:41.707]  Getting together in a pack hunt of a cave bear and routing it with torches and chasing it down a gullyway and then having our people wait at the other end and throw big boulders down on its head.
[00:35:42.348 --> 00:35:51.052]  After we killed all the cave bears and killed all the elephants and ran them out of Europe and killed them all in the Americas, then the warring with each other started.
[00:35:51.072 --> 00:36:00.738]  And it had always gone on to a certain extent, but as our numbers grew, parasitism, or the parasitic feeding of the elite and their strongmen,
[00:36:02.231 --> 00:36:06.753]  on the slaves really kicked off 6,000 plus years ago.
[00:36:06.813 --> 00:36:12.374]  It really started before that in the middle of the Bronze Age, during the last warming period.
[00:36:15.295 --> 00:36:25.779]  And to know that most adults, and this is from a view, just what you say is an anthropologist angle of what's happening,
[00:36:28.971 --> 00:36:36.756]  That we now have several generations raised in the Western world in a total lap of luxury.
[00:36:36.776 --> 00:36:48.423]  I mean, even if you're poor, you generally have the food and shelter and entertainment provided to you.
[00:36:51.865 --> 00:36:57.329]  And the entertainment, 99% of it is non-educational, non-informative,
[00:36:58.181 --> 00:37:05.628]  It is basically showing us as mammals who are tribal creatures who learn by imprinting on what we see as leaders.
[00:37:06.128 --> 00:37:12.774]  They show us male role models that are stupid, mindless, burping creatures who only watch football.
[00:37:12.895 --> 00:37:13.715]  That is manly.
[00:37:13.775 --> 00:37:14.936]  Being an idiot is manly.
[00:37:16.077 --> 00:37:22.623]  The women are in charge and boss everyone around and they themselves feel inadequate and are peddly and mindless.
[00:37:23.004 --> 00:37:24.285]  And the women imprint on that.
[00:37:25.453 --> 00:37:33.457]  To be nothing but sexual objects instead of all their other esteemed roles that they also, of course, are meant to fill.
[00:37:36.759 --> 00:37:40.381]  And as a society we are robbed of what it is to even be our species.
[00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:47.244]  We are robbed of our incredible history, our amazing past, all of our just absolutely amazing accomplishments.
[00:37:48.945 --> 00:37:53.087]  The fact that with our minds we were able to build civilizations,
[00:37:54.622 --> 00:38:14.177]  and develop complex sciences and that we physically were able to tame the saber-toothed cats and the cave bears and the elements
[00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:18.270]  Not anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:21.051]  You have a public who just sees cities.
[00:38:21.151 --> 00:38:22.771]  It's just there for them to drive through.
[00:38:22.991 --> 00:38:24.932]  Who don't ask, how did roads get built?
[00:38:24.992 --> 00:38:28.853]  How does power come into my office, into these light bulbs and give illumination?
[00:38:29.233 --> 00:38:32.574]  How do computer microchips and systems work?
[00:38:34.894 --> 00:38:35.994]  How does trade work?
[00:38:37.075 --> 00:38:39.175]  How does the money system operate?
[00:38:40.698 --> 00:38:41.739]  What are mercenaries?
[00:38:41.839 --> 00:38:42.860]  What is Blackwater?
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:51.185]  What does it mean when the police start garbing themselves in black and wearing masks and building giant prisons everywhere and putting cameras up everywhere?
[00:38:51.446 --> 00:38:55.168]  This is literally... Let me explain why I'm so freaked out, okay?
[00:38:55.188 --> 00:39:00.732]  Because I'm intellectual at one level and I'm somewhat informed historically and I don't have a bad brain.
[00:39:02.954 --> 00:39:06.416]  And then I also am primitive at the same time.
[00:39:06.496 --> 00:39:08.938]  I have those attributes of that
[00:39:10.359 --> 00:39:23.006]  I can wear both hats, both as an observer and scientifically look at things, as a novice historian, because it's addicting, it's very interesting, and I can also wear the hat of a warrior.
[00:39:23.647 --> 00:39:33.973]  I can also wear the hat of a primitive protector, a guardian, someone watching the mouth of the cave at night for big cats or bears to rouse the others.
[00:39:34.273 --> 00:39:37.755]  Because if you don't, it'll come in and grab one of you and drag you off into the night.
[00:39:39.082 --> 00:39:44.404]  So I'm like a dog that sits at the door waiting for someone to come and knock on it so I can bark.
[00:39:44.424 --> 00:39:51.766]  You know, I have my primitive side, we all do, and I have the, quote, higher elements of man, and I am in touch with both of them.
[00:39:52.287 --> 00:39:55.428]  And so, let's just say I'm hitting on all eight cylinders.
[00:39:58.729 --> 00:40:00.329]  Which is what all of us are supposed to do.
[00:40:00.449 --> 00:40:01.310]  It's nothing special.
[00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:04.971]  Except in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
[00:40:12.293 --> 00:40:15.115]  And so I literally have my instincts.
[00:40:15.255 --> 00:40:26.981]  I have ancestral memories, which they hypothesized 50, 60 years ago, Conrad Lorenz and others, in which they've now done many scientific studies, major universities, and indeed, they're there.
[00:40:29.062 --> 00:40:29.702]  Art types.
[00:40:32.684 --> 00:40:33.804]  The sixth sense.
[00:40:36.926 --> 00:40:37.266]  All of it.
[00:40:38.852 --> 00:40:52.318]  And everything the entertainment and the media and the mind control does is you create a background shatter or interference where you can't be still and face up to what's happening around you in the world.
[00:40:54.479 --> 00:41:06.464]  And literally, our society is that mother whale, that gray whale and that baby calf, that juvenile calf, a third the size of its mother.
[00:41:09.665 --> 00:41:10.305]  A bull calf.
[00:41:14.768 --> 00:41:20.592]  Our society can't recognize, though, the wolves swirling around us.
[00:41:21.293 --> 00:41:28.998]  The wolves of the sea, the killers, swirling and spiraling predatorily around us.
[00:41:30.078 --> 00:41:37.103]  I mean, that's what the cameras and the surveillance and the CPS and the school security guards and the breaking the arms
[00:41:38.553 --> 00:41:43.956]  And the mercury and the vaccines and the wars and the government-sponsored terror.
[00:41:44.476 --> 00:41:54.500]  That government-sponsored terror was like primitive humans beating drums, yelling and screaming with torches through the woods, driving the elephant herd towards the cliff.
[00:41:55.801 --> 00:41:58.002]  And then that's how they would get enough food for the whole winter.
[00:41:58.042 --> 00:41:59.923]  They would then jerk and dry all that meat.
[00:42:00.363 --> 00:42:03.444]  That's how they extincted the mammoths in Europe and in the Americas.
[00:42:05.545 --> 00:42:06.646]  The Asians here and the
[00:42:10.504 --> 00:42:17.471]  Anglos, the Ice Age subspecies in Europe.
[00:42:20.194 --> 00:42:28.042]  And so, I would also add that Ice Age man developed particular concerns
[00:42:29.116 --> 00:42:56.290]  about preparation and seeing threats because the pressures in Africa and other areas were even greater on a daily basis on the average danger line or on a graph of daily danger from predators but overall the extreme dangers of winter and climate shift for northern man and then that gets off into larger debates in anthropology but I'm already
[00:42:57.029 --> 00:43:20.202]  Digressing, the point here is that the New World Order is making massive preparations to fully enslave us, to fully bring us into bondage, and they're saying it in their defense authorization funding packages, like the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, and the Military Commissions Act, and the Patriot Act, and in the PDD 51.
[00:43:26.016 --> 00:43:41.510]  Literally, if you had to give it an image, it is literally that whale, with its baby, with a million killer whales, like a giant black hole, spinning around us, coming in.
[00:43:41.591 --> 00:43:51.680]  But instead of just one gray whale and its baby, there are millions of gray whales, and there are tens of millions of the predators swirling around, and they're grabbing
[00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:55.151]  Baby whales in front of us every day.
[00:43:55.191 --> 00:43:56.392]  They're dragging them off.
[00:43:58.633 --> 00:44:05.157]  You notice they don't keep statistics on the number of people that die in prisons.
[00:44:06.658 --> 00:44:09.300]  They used to up until the year 2001.
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:10.340]  They quit keeping them.
[00:44:11.861 --> 00:44:16.744]  They still, until about a year ago, were keeping statistics on the number of children that die in CPS hands.
[00:44:16.764 --> 00:44:19.226]  It's five times the average of any other group.
[00:44:19.946 --> 00:44:21.367]  But they don't like to publicize those.
[00:44:22.276 --> 00:44:34.840]  They don't like to... I heard Dr. Dina Dell yesterday, nationally syndicated, on seven days a week, saying that mercury had been taken out of vaccines.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:43.863]  Now, you can go to the doctor right now, ask the nurse to show you the ampule, ask to see the ingredients list that comes in the package, and it'll say thimerosal.
[00:44:44.163 --> 00:44:48.424]  You can go type thimerosal into Google, and it'll say lead, and it'll say mercury.
[00:44:49.568 --> 00:44:52.268]  And you can ask the nurse, and they'll say, okay, I guess there is mercury.
[00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:55.949]  The point is, is they said they took it out five years ago, six years ago.
[00:44:55.989 --> 00:44:56.729]  They didn't really do that.
[00:44:56.749 --> 00:44:57.909]  We've talked about this at nauseam.
[00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:02.450]  But, but... Is Dr. Dynadel openly lying?
[00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:05.451]  No, I think he probably just heard the reports five, six years ago.
[00:45:05.471 --> 00:45:07.371]  They took it out, and he just believes it!
[00:45:11.592 --> 00:45:18.273]  It doesn't matter if I have AP Reuters and all the medical reports, the fact that they actually increased the amount of mercury for some unknown reason,
[00:45:19.224 --> 00:45:21.105]  To four times its normal level on average?
[00:45:21.145 --> 00:45:22.226]  Some have five times now?
[00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:28.890]  I don't know.
[00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:31.752]  It said it was 50 times the safe level on the MMR shot.
[00:45:32.072 --> 00:45:33.533]  It's now 250 times.
[00:45:33.573 --> 00:45:34.293]  Is that five times?
[00:45:37.135 --> 00:45:42.938]  And then they simultaneously say thimerosal is good for you and make announcements and say it's in there now and it's good for your brain.
[00:45:43.859 --> 00:45:45.380]  And that lead toys are good.
[00:45:47.424 --> 00:45:59.028]  So now, as gray whales out there being attacked, we can't even notice when we're under assault.
[00:46:00.089 --> 00:46:03.190]  We can't even recognize it when we're under assault.
[00:46:05.651 --> 00:46:09.992]  And there's just an attitude that the cop pulls you over, wants you to answer questions.
[00:46:10.032 --> 00:46:10.532]  You won't do it.
[00:46:10.552 --> 00:46:12.133]  The cop says, alright, I'm going to frame you then.
[00:46:12.153 --> 00:46:14.814]  And we get more and more of these videos in.
[00:46:16.411 --> 00:46:19.532]  And cops brag about testifying on the stand.
[00:46:23.774 --> 00:46:29.856]  And our prison population has gone from less than a million to over 7 million in the system, 4 plus million behind bars.
[00:46:30.236 --> 00:46:34.038]  And we've gone from 300,000 cops to a million and a half, and they're just going up from there.
[00:46:36.619 --> 00:46:37.519]  What's it all for?
[00:46:39.099 --> 00:46:40.620]  It's not for the aggravated felons.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.101]  They're being hired by the military.
[00:46:42.761 --> 00:46:44.381]  I'd tell you that six years ago you couldn't believe me.
[00:46:44.582 --> 00:46:45.742]  Now it's all over the newspapers.
[00:46:48.107 --> 00:46:54.512]  When the government starts hiring the criminals, folks, that is the biggest red flag there is.
[00:47:01.178 --> 00:47:06.883]  And the sixth thing is, at least the killer whales are in their pod, in their pack, in their own crew.
[00:47:11.427 --> 00:47:12.988]  They're doing what God designed them to do.
[00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:20.171]  There'd be a billion whales eating all the plankton if they didn't do it.
[00:47:23.893 --> 00:47:24.953]  A billion gray whales.
[00:47:30.115 --> 00:47:34.277]  But the killer whales don't go off and kill each other.
[00:47:36.318 --> 00:47:42.200]  And so see, you're really a gray whale trained to be a killer whale with cops.
[00:47:43.462 --> 00:47:51.885]  Out there attacking your own kind when the bosses up above you have put aspartame in over 9,000 foods.
[00:47:52.925 --> 00:47:54.806]  They put mercury in your children's vaccines.
[00:47:55.246 --> 00:48:00.708]  They got lead-fired plants all over the country that were all in mercury.
[00:48:01.448 --> 00:48:02.789]  Lead, mercury, you name it's in there.
[00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:09.791]  And we've got clean coal, but the government won't let us mine that out of Utah.
[00:48:10.231 --> 00:48:11.672]  Enough to run the country for 200 years.
[00:48:13.154 --> 00:48:14.714]  We're doing all this genetic engineering.
[00:48:14.734 --> 00:48:17.355]  We're doing all these horrible evil things to us.
[00:48:21.375 --> 00:48:24.236]  And I can't even get you to recognize that you're with us.
[00:48:25.076 --> 00:48:26.216]  Whether you like it or not.
[00:48:26.296 --> 00:48:28.657]  See, I always say you've got a choice.
[00:48:29.577 --> 00:48:31.757]  Join us or join the evil.
[00:48:32.517 --> 00:48:34.238]  But really even that's a false choice.
[00:48:35.498 --> 00:48:38.458]  Because the evil doesn't want you.
[00:48:38.518 --> 00:48:40.099]  You're not part of the game.
[00:48:40.159 --> 00:48:41.039]  You're used.
[00:48:41.419 --> 00:48:42.019]  You're hated.
[00:48:44.182 --> 00:48:49.528]  I'll never forget Rick Perry's... One of Rick Perry's... I'm not going to say who it is.
[00:48:49.828 --> 00:48:52.451]  When you see Rick Perry or the people on television, you're going to see the guy.
[00:48:52.752 --> 00:48:53.432]  He's well known.
[00:48:53.873 --> 00:48:54.914]  I've seen him on television.
[00:48:54.954 --> 00:48:55.835]  I've seen him at speeches.
[00:48:56.416 --> 00:49:01.702]  He walked over and showed me gubernatorial boots that I've seen in Texas Monthly that the governor gave his staff.
[00:49:01.802 --> 00:49:02.943]  I didn't need to see it to know.
[00:49:04.525 --> 00:49:05.346]  He listened to the show.
[00:49:06.491 --> 00:49:08.572]  He even told me his name, but I'm not going to say it on air.
[00:49:08.772 --> 00:49:09.493]  I need to call him.
[00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:13.354]  I don't want to get him in trouble, because he thinks he's so in with the governor, they won't kick him out.
[00:49:13.955 --> 00:49:14.975]  I don't believe that for a minute.
[00:49:15.496 --> 00:49:30.343]  And he says, yeah, 10 years ago, before I joined the governor, when he was, you know, the head of the Senate, I was a medic at Fort Sam Houston, and they sent down from Port Bliss
[00:49:33.735 --> 00:49:34.835]  I forget if it was six or eight.
[00:49:35.195 --> 00:49:36.296]  I told the story the day after.
[00:49:36.336 --> 00:49:37.436]  That's when you get the accurate numbers.
[00:49:37.456 --> 00:49:38.656]  A few weeks ago I told the story.
[00:49:38.676 --> 00:49:39.476]  It was six or eight.
[00:49:39.516 --> 00:49:41.277]  Was it six?
[00:49:41.357 --> 00:49:42.337]  Special Forces guys.
[00:49:42.377 --> 00:49:43.657]  And they said, OK, give them these shots.
[00:49:43.697 --> 00:49:45.178]  And the doctors at the base gave them the shots.
[00:49:45.518 --> 00:49:49.779]  They were in the same dorm as they were.
[00:49:50.339 --> 00:49:52.039]  And the guys all died within two days.
[00:49:52.119 --> 00:49:53.339]  Horrible autoimmune deaths.
[00:49:53.359 --> 00:49:55.280]  You know, blood, pus coming out.
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:57.140]  And everybody knew.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.621]  And it was like, OK, it was a bioweapons test.
[00:49:59.941 --> 00:50:00.841]  Don't say anything about it.
[00:50:01.719 --> 00:50:02.920]  Strip this whole thing out.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.482]  Clean everything with disinfectant.
[00:50:04.922 --> 00:50:05.823]  Unbolt the bunks.
[00:50:05.863 --> 00:50:07.285]  Take them outside and spray them down.
[00:50:10.268 --> 00:50:11.349]  Every one of them died.
[00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:13.631]  Man, was it six or eight?
[00:50:14.612 --> 00:50:15.232]  Ah, it doesn't matter.
[00:50:15.252 --> 00:50:20.157]  I should have said eight.
[00:50:21.218 --> 00:50:23.080]  Every one of them died is the point.
[00:50:23.846 --> 00:50:31.711]  And this is why, because I talked about vaccines having bioweapons in them, and I had all these women coming up going, it sterilized me, it made me go into convulsions, it made me do this, oh my gosh.
[00:50:32.231 --> 00:50:33.732]  Tetanus shot, that's when it all happened.
[00:50:33.752 --> 00:50:34.773]  Why'd you say tetanus shot?
[00:50:34.813 --> 00:50:35.573]  How do you know that?
[00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:39.916]  Because it was all over foreign newspapers in the mid-90s through 2000?
[00:50:41.397 --> 00:50:42.738]  Because the UN said they were doing it?
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:47.781]  It's like my pediatrician.
[00:50:48.883 --> 00:50:53.344]  He said, don't, don't tell anybody, but yeah, you know, I volunteer each year for the city clinic.
[00:50:53.684 --> 00:50:57.005]  We're giving the kids HB 40 oral vaccine.
[00:50:57.025 --> 00:50:57.685]  We're not supposed to.
[00:50:57.705 --> 00:50:59.826]  I don't know why, why they told us to.
[00:50:59.926 --> 00:51:10.408]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.768 --> 00:51:18.230]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave
[00:51:19.099 --> 00:51:26.182]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.562 --> 00:51:37.967]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.287 --> 00:51:41.849]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.249 --> 00:51:43.970]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:48.372]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:02.147 --> 00:52:05.708]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:05.768 --> 00:52:06.268]  are located?
[00:52:06.488 --> 00:52:09.869]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:54:12.363 --> 00:54:20.945]  The globalists that run the society openly talk about how they detest us, how they hate us, and how they want to cull 85% of us en masse.
[00:54:21.306 --> 00:54:22.346]  That's what Endgame covers.
[00:54:22.366 --> 00:54:23.326]  That's what it documents.
[00:54:26.547 --> 00:54:27.027]  This is what
[00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:29.011]  The reality shows.
[00:54:30.351 --> 00:54:31.452]  The facts are in.
[00:54:33.193 --> 00:54:34.714]  And nothing's going to change that.
[00:54:34.774 --> 00:54:35.975]  You can't rationalize it.
[00:54:36.015 --> 00:54:37.015]  You can't make excuses.
[00:54:37.035 --> 00:54:38.796]  You can't say I'm making it up.
[00:54:39.697 --> 00:54:42.338]  You need to check out my claims and find out they're true.
[00:54:42.378 --> 00:54:43.419]  This is real.
[00:54:43.779 --> 00:54:44.760]  You have to face it.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:50.563]  I'm talking to military, police, school teachers, auto mechanics, UPS drivers.
[00:54:50.603 --> 00:54:51.223]  It doesn't matter.
[00:54:52.504 --> 00:54:53.785]  I'm talking to everybody out there.
[00:54:55.439 --> 00:54:59.744]  We have an elite who have honed their predatory instincts, who are totally psychopathic.
[00:54:59.764 --> 00:55:03.728]  They feel no allegiance to individuals, to countries, to anybody.
[00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:06.311]  They enjoy hurting us.
[00:55:07.272 --> 00:55:09.054]  They enjoy raw power.
[00:55:11.857 --> 00:55:14.720]  They are setting up a one-world government right now.
[00:55:19.494 --> 00:55:25.358]  They are setting up a horrible police state and telling us torture and secret arrest and no habeas corpus is good.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:39.047]  They're moving ahead very, very quickly and they know how to tribally manipulate us to feel like we're part of their system by dangling Ahmed Dinejid in front of us and other such boogeymen.
[00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:45.731]  You better get sophisticated and you better get sophisticated now, folks.
[00:55:45.771 --> 00:55:46.592]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:55:48.775 --> 00:55:52.258]  Look at this story Paul Watson's got up right now on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:52.298 --> 00:55:53.098]  It's so huge.
[00:55:53.639 --> 00:55:58.182]  I should have been talking about this for the last hour, but I wanted to get it out there that we're being fed on by our own species.
[00:55:59.804 --> 00:56:02.846]  FBI thought bombs brought down the towers on 9-11.
[00:56:03.226 --> 00:56:07.970]  Now we mentioned this a long time ago, but it's now back in the news and there's audio and video clips of it.
[00:56:10.292 --> 00:56:13.314]  FBI thought bombs brought down towers on 9-11.
[00:56:13.914 --> 00:56:18.398]  Working premise that truck bombs aided WTC collapse dovetails with arrest
[00:56:19.588 --> 00:56:21.669]  Reports that were later buried.
[00:56:21.689 --> 00:56:27.613]  We're going to play a clip of this coming up later in about 30 minutes after our guest joins us.
[00:56:28.413 --> 00:56:31.895]  But this story is so important and needs to be seen by everyone.
[00:56:32.435 --> 00:56:35.697]  I'm asking you to go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:36.037 --> 00:56:46.163]  We got a dig through last Friday and so hundreds of thousands of new people were able to read our story about them breaking that little girl's arm and then framing everybody and that's coming up in a few minutes, the mother.
[00:56:47.748 --> 00:56:50.209]  But this story needs to be gotten out to everybody.
[00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:53.591]  FBI thought bombs had brought down towers on 9-11.
[00:56:54.711 --> 00:57:03.255]  I told you a few weeks ago, it finally came out in mainstream news, and I was able to find a teaching curriculum I was given by the Texas teacher.
[00:57:04.335 --> 00:57:10.318]  They're going to make Spanish the first language in schools that are even minority illegal aliens.
[00:57:11.298 --> 00:57:15.420]  They're going to teach science, reading, writing, and math
[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:17.381]  We're good to go.
[00:57:47.247 --> 00:57:49.948]  Well, then that was in the AP in Reuters, remember, two weeks ago.
[00:57:50.688 --> 00:57:55.890]  It said, from Texas to Oregon to New York, they're just going to teach in Spanish.
[00:57:57.451 --> 00:58:04.213]  So, you talk about destroying this country, folks, and hurting the people that speak Spanish as well, and the people that speak English.
[00:58:04.873 --> 00:58:08.095]  English is the world language because of the British Navy and Empire.
[00:58:08.935 --> 00:58:11.816]  That's what everybody in Asia and in Europe and in Russia
[00:58:13.297 --> 00:58:17.178]  And in Latin America, the upper class families teach them English because that's the world language.
[00:58:19.478 --> 00:58:22.159]  Thanks to the piratical nature of the British.
[00:58:22.759 --> 00:58:25.179]  Scratch an Englishman, find a pirate, the old saying goes.
[00:58:25.679 --> 00:58:27.440]  You know why the sun never set on the British Empire?
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.900]  God wouldn't trust an Englishman in the dark.
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:34.261]  Again, God wouldn't trust an Englishman in the dark.
[00:58:34.901 --> 00:58:38.862]  Alright, no attack on the Anglos.
[00:58:39.842 --> 00:58:40.582]  We'll be right back.

[00:58:57.674 --> 00:59:01.858]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.519 --> 00:59:03.320]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:05.041]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.642 --> 00:59:09.566]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.846 --> 00:59:13.910]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.604 --> 00:59:25.265]  We're all in this together.
[00:59:25.465 --> 00:59:31.007]  A scientifically crafted psychological dictatorship is being built all around us.
[00:59:32.628 --> 00:59:46.955]  The Defense Department, the State Department, over 70 years ago, back when it was the War Department, hired top psychologists, psychiatrists, and PR firms, headed up by people like Edward Bernays, to propagandize and brainwash the public.
[00:59:48.456 --> 00:59:51.117]  They now have completely brainwashed most of the population.
[00:59:51.943 --> 01:00:06.275]  And they are now training the police and security guards that if you don't submit, and that means tell them what they want, do everything they say, they taser you, break your arms, or, in the case of this woman at the airport, jump on your neck with their knee and break your neck and then throw you in the jail cell and say you killed yourself.
[01:00:07.556 --> 01:00:08.637]  That's what they do now.
[01:00:09.017 --> 01:00:19.226]  And this is all encouraged, it's all being done, because they now are going to destroy the dollar, bankrupt the economy fully, and they want to be able to shoot people in the streets like they're doing in Burma.
[01:00:23.957 --> 01:00:27.618]  School guards break a child's arm and arrest her for dropping cake.
[01:00:27.738 --> 01:00:34.440]  Our story went to, um, in the top ten on the web over the weekend, according to the big rating services that are out there.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.800]  One of the most viewed stories.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:41.082]  I've had a number one story before on the London Bonding, but we, every once in a while, get in the top ten.
[01:00:41.102 --> 01:00:42.002]  This was in the top ten.
[01:00:42.022 --> 01:00:44.442]  What, number eight according to one service, number nine according to another.
[01:00:44.463 --> 01:00:46.143]  It's interesting that it got a lot of attention.
[01:00:47.182 --> 01:00:51.005]  School guards break a child's arm and arrest her for dropping cake.
[01:00:51.045 --> 01:00:55.408]  Pandemic of police and security violence continues unabated.
[01:00:56.249 --> 01:01:03.694]  But the bigger story here isn't that they just broke this young lady's arm, who's very soft-spoken and has a disciplinary record.
[01:01:03.934 --> 01:01:04.575]  They admit that.
[01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:14.122]  It's that when a young man videotaped it with his camera phone, they admittedly tackled him, jumped on him with their knees, assaulted him,
[01:01:14.804 --> 01:01:20.926]  Three burly security guards, one of them looks like he weighs 300 pounds at least, jumping up and down on him.
[01:01:21.146 --> 01:01:24.248]  The guy is obese, but he also has large arms, I'm looking at him.
[01:01:26.608 --> 01:01:29.049]  One of those guys that eats three pizzas a day, but does lift weights.
[01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:37.172]  And they tackled him, beat him up, and then later when he complained and said he was going to sue, they said, okay, we're charging you with battery.
[01:01:37.653 --> 01:01:44.055]  The mother showed up, they wouldn't give her her daughter, she brushed past her charging her with battery, but after the fact when she said she was going to press charges,
[01:01:45.854 --> 01:01:56.261]  They arrested another girl who complained, and they broke her arm, the daughter's arm, and didn't go after her for battery until after she was going to sue.
[01:01:57.021 --> 01:01:58.202]  And that's the story here.
[01:01:59.703 --> 01:02:02.885]  They have all these witnesses in an entire cafeteria saying they didn't touch them.
[01:02:03.765 --> 01:02:11.310]  The only person that touched anybody was the mother, and she brushed by after, like the mama whale we were talking about in the last segment, when those killer whales were eating her baby.
[01:02:12.407 --> 01:02:15.950]  She, uh, brushed past the killer whales, basically, to use the analogy.
[01:02:16.611 --> 01:02:18.032]  And, uh, I'm not calling you a whale man.
[01:02:18.072 --> 01:02:23.436]  I was getting into Animal Planet last hour, watching these killer whales eat this baby whale, and the mama trying to fight them off.
[01:02:23.596 --> 01:02:29.902]  And so the mother just brushed past the god, the school vice-principal, and went to get her daughter.
[01:02:29.982 --> 01:02:33.044]  And then they left her alone, so she said, I'm gonna file charges, and she called the cops.
[01:02:33.505 --> 01:02:41.051]  She called more killer whales to save her from killer whales, and then they went ahead and attacked her and took her off, uh, as killer whales do.
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:44.541]  Alright, I'm getting off into my killer whale analogy.
[01:02:44.561 --> 01:02:45.602]  Prestations just joined us.
[01:02:45.662 --> 01:02:51.926]  I was talking about Animal Planet last hour and some horrible footage I saw of killer whales killing a baby whale and the mother couldn't save it.
[01:02:52.927 --> 01:02:55.308]  So when we get back, we're going to talk to this nice lady.
[01:02:55.488 --> 01:03:03.614]  She's very well spoken, worked for another school district nearby, has no record herself of course, done nothing wrong, and she's now lost her job.
[01:03:03.674 --> 01:03:07.096]  She's not on paid leave like the guy that broke her daughter's arm.
[01:03:07.836 --> 01:03:10.418]  See, if she'd have been a security guard and broke an arm, she'd be just fine.
[01:03:11.218 --> 01:03:15.700]  But she brushed past, when they were trying to hold her back, from getting to her daughter.
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:20.323]  No doubt they wanted to tell her daughter to shut up and go along with having her wrist broken.
[01:03:21.303 --> 01:03:22.444]  Her shoulders also hurt.
[01:03:23.544 --> 01:03:30.168]  They took her arm in the video and cranked the elbow, which, at an angle, all the way back to almost her head.
[01:03:30.588 --> 01:03:33.449]  I'm surprised that the shoulder isn't completely ripped out of the socket.
[01:03:33.889 --> 01:03:37.351]  And I would bet there's rocator tough damage, lifelong injury.
[01:03:38.412 --> 01:03:38.992]  But, uh,
[01:03:41.764 --> 01:03:43.946]  I remember when I had Tony Brown on the show many years ago.
[01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:46.828]  He said, what they do in the black community, they'll do in your community next.
[01:03:46.888 --> 01:03:47.849]  And now they do it everywhere.
[01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:49.810]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:50.291]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.194 --> 01:03:53.954]  Terrorism!
[01:03:54.114 --> 01:03:54.854]  Terrorism!
[01:03:54.954 --> 01:04:01.016]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:04:01.276 --> 01:04:02.876]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:04:03.136 --> 01:04:05.597]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:04:05.997 --> 01:04:20.560]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:20.921]  government.
[01:04:21.081 --> 01:04:22.861]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:04:23.261 --> 01:04:29.166]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:04:29.326 --> 01:04:33.790]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[01:05:01.562 --> 01:05:09.206]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:09.884 --> 01:05:16.968]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.348 --> 01:05:28.734]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.074 --> 01:05:32.776]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.017 --> 01:05:34.978]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.318 --> 01:05:39.160]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:07:15.815 --> 01:07:18.416]  Latricia Majors joins us again today.
[01:07:18.436 --> 01:07:21.398]  I had her on last night, but I wanted to be able to tell more of her story.
[01:07:22.899 --> 01:07:30.223]  And coming up at the bottom of the hour in about 25 minutes from now, FBI thought bombs brought down towers on 9-11.
[01:07:31.083 --> 01:07:34.625]  Huge news up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:07:36.166 --> 01:07:44.910]  The story here for stations that just joined us recapping is that not only did she clean the cake up three times, the security guard then broke her arm,
[01:07:46.044 --> 01:07:52.770]  Twisted her arm all the way back to where her shoulder was touching her ear and the elbow was straight up above the head.
[01:07:55.632 --> 01:08:04.599]  Then the cameraman, they assaulted him, a young man with a camera phone, and then they charged him and his sister with battery after the fact when they said they were going to sue them.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.602]  And they do this, they just throw charges on you to protect themselves.
[01:08:07.942 --> 01:08:09.603]  Psychopathic, sociopathic.
[01:08:10.324 --> 01:08:13.807]  I mean, can you imagine just trying to ruin somebody's life just because you did wrong?
[01:08:14.635 --> 01:08:16.156]  They sleep good at night doing it, folks.
[01:08:17.156 --> 01:08:27.460]  Now, the type of, uh, you reap what you sow, comes around, goes around, call it karma if you want, but you couldn't do a worse thing than bear false witness in front of a position of authority.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:32.702]  And to hurt children, it's better for you to tie a millstone around your neck and throw it into the deepest sea.
[01:08:33.382 --> 01:08:35.303]  But you've got to learn that for yourself, don't you?
[01:08:35.323 --> 01:08:39.745]  Just when your life's a wreck, and you've done, and it's totally ruined, just maybe you can repent then.
[01:08:39.765 --> 01:08:42.766]  I want to tell all these wicked people that have charged false
[01:08:43.456 --> 01:08:48.257]  falsely and ruined lives and sent people to prison and you snicker and you laugh about it all day long.
[01:08:50.237 --> 01:08:55.438]  We've got to queue up that Johnny Cash song to go out of break for the last two minutes of this segment and we'll come back and talk to our guest.
[01:08:55.939 --> 01:09:00.079]  Going to our guest right now, as this unfolds, it was a protest Friday there.
[01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:04.880]  Parents told their horror stories, but regardless this is all on video now.
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.141]  Latricia Majors, thanks for joining us.
[01:09:07.601 --> 01:09:08.301]  Thank you for having me.
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:15.502]  Now, the media was talking about you getting Johnny Cochran's law firm, but you haven't yet, so you need legal help.
[01:09:16.582 --> 01:09:17.182]  Yes, I do.
[01:09:17.442 --> 01:09:23.343]  Just in a nutshell, walk through the chain of events that happened, and any details I haven't fleshed out for people.
[01:09:24.684 --> 01:09:30.465]  Well, my daughter's friend, she had brought a birthday cake to school to celebrate her birthday.
[01:09:31.565 --> 01:09:37.707]  And the kids were in the outside cafeteria area, and they decided to
[01:09:38.243 --> 01:09:41.846]  You know, just smear cake on the birthday girl's face, just for fun.
[01:09:42.686 --> 01:09:51.132]  And a couple kids started, you know, kind of tossing cake around and doing the frosting, trying to put it on each other's face and what have you.
[01:09:51.152 --> 01:09:54.314]  So the bell rang for them all to go to class.
[01:09:54.895 --> 01:10:03.101]  So my daughter said they all were cleaning up and she took some cake and walked it over to the trash to throw it away.
[01:10:04.181 --> 01:10:06.183]  When she went to the trash, someone bumped into her.
[01:10:07.065 --> 01:10:08.345]  And the cake fell on the ground.
[01:10:08.365 --> 01:10:14.727]  So the security guard, Chris Niemeyer, he walked over and asked her to pick it up.
[01:10:15.667 --> 01:10:21.049]  So she picks up the cake and put it back on the plate and throw it into the trash.
[01:10:21.569 --> 01:10:27.050]  She then proceeded to go to the restroom to wipe all of the frosting and cake to wash her hands.
[01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:34.192]  And she said as she came out of the restroom, he was standing right there waiting for her and said, I told you to pick the cake up.
[01:10:34.764 --> 01:10:36.585]  And she said, I did pick the cake up.
[01:10:36.645 --> 01:10:38.186]  He said, well, you need to get it all up.
[01:10:38.786 --> 01:10:44.588]  And she said to me, she said, Mom, there was nothing but just like little crumbs and frosting, you know.
[01:10:45.069 --> 01:10:51.191]  So she said she had, she went on and attempted to get the rest of it up, scraping it with her fingers and threw it in the trash.
[01:10:52.132 --> 01:10:55.213]  She said at that time he received a call on walkie talkie.
[01:10:55.593 --> 01:10:57.114]  So he started talking to someone.
[01:10:57.174 --> 01:11:03.096]  So she said that she assumed that he was finished with her and he was satisfied with her getting the cake up a second time.
[01:11:04.645 --> 01:11:08.149]  He called her back and said, I told you to get the crumbs up.
[01:11:08.169 --> 01:11:09.090]  Get it all up.
[01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:10.931]  And she said, I can't.
[01:11:10.991 --> 01:11:12.513]  I got all of it up that I can get up.
[01:11:12.533 --> 01:11:16.497]  And again, this is who wants a job as a school security guard.
[01:11:16.737 --> 01:11:23.804]  There's a big scandal, it's in mainstream newspapers, about the guard that makes sexual comments to the girls but they won't fire him.
[01:11:23.864 --> 01:11:25.126]  That's a big scandal right now.
[01:11:27.127 --> 01:11:36.270]  In criminology, they'll tell you people that want to be school security guards or school cops or CPS workers are at the highest levels of pedophilia.
[01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:40.672]  And I'm not saying that about these guys, but statistically, if you were a pedophile, where would you go?
[01:11:41.112 --> 01:11:42.252]  You'd be a truancy officer.
[01:11:42.292 --> 01:11:45.233]  You'd be a jail guard in a juvenile facility.
[01:11:45.673 --> 01:11:46.293]  That's why.
[01:11:46.474 --> 01:11:49.314]  So you tend to get scum wanting these jobs.
[01:11:49.355 --> 01:11:49.815]  Please continue.
[01:11:49.835 --> 01:11:49.955]  Yes.
[01:11:50.315 --> 01:11:53.756]  So she said she proceeded to walk the class.
[01:11:54.634 --> 01:12:05.684]  And the next thing she knew, he had grabbed her by her arm, twisted it behind her back, and she said when he twisted it behind her back, he raised up on it, which forced her to bend over.
[01:12:05.704 --> 01:12:14.372]  So at that point, he slammed her on the table, and he said something to the effect, hold still, nappy head, or something to that effect.
[01:12:14.392 --> 01:12:15.894]  And by the way, there's video of all this.
[01:12:16.314 --> 01:12:17.275]  Yes, yes there is.
[01:12:18.995 --> 01:12:20.396]  Folks, watch it, I'm not kidding.
[01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:22.977]  I mean, this is brutal.
[01:12:23.037 --> 01:12:27.400]  I mean, this is cranking the arm up with pleasure while she's not resisting.
[01:12:27.641 --> 01:12:35.406]  And you can see him with a pleasure, a demon look on his face with the mouth pulled back and the teeth just going, ripping a girl's arm off.
[01:12:35.546 --> 01:12:36.667]  Oh, it's good.
[01:12:36.787 --> 01:12:37.508]  Oh, it's good.
[01:12:37.528 --> 01:12:39.129]  It's good to kill this country.
[01:12:39.289 --> 01:12:39.869]  Oh, I love it.
[01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:42.351]  Absolutely.
[01:12:42.371 --> 01:12:45.153]  Then she started screaming and hollering.
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:46.421]  Please let me go.
[01:12:46.521 --> 01:12:47.261]  Please let me go.
[01:12:47.301 --> 01:12:47.921]  You're hurting me.
[01:12:47.982 --> 01:12:49.963]  And that's the added predatory pleasure.
[01:12:50.003 --> 01:12:51.944]  He was feeding at that point, demonically.
[01:12:52.004 --> 01:12:52.684]  Okay, please continue.
[01:12:52.744 --> 01:12:52.845]  Yes.
[01:12:53.465 --> 01:12:58.488]  And then she, at that point, other students gathered around, and they were all yelling, let her go!
[01:12:58.968 --> 01:12:59.589]  Let her go!
[01:12:59.609 --> 01:13:01.550]  You know, and he didn't let her go.
[01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:05.452]  So I was actually on my lunch break, and I had a parent call me.
[01:13:06.153 --> 01:13:08.874]  How long did his feeding continue?
[01:13:08.894 --> 01:13:10.535]  How long did the vampiric feeding continue?
[01:13:11.256 --> 01:13:14.598]  I'm not sure, but I noticed in the pictures that the principal was
[01:13:15.143 --> 01:13:18.444]  You know, standing out there, you know, watching all of this go on.
[01:13:18.984 --> 01:13:25.025]  You know, if you see, there's one picture that was on the front page and the principal, he has a blue shirt on and a red tie.
[01:13:25.365 --> 01:13:28.766]  He was standing right by when all of this abuse was taking place.
[01:13:30.166 --> 01:13:31.086]  And he did nothing.
[01:13:32.767 --> 01:13:40.388]  So the parent called me because she said that she saw my daughter and she was crying and screaming and she said she asked my daughter, have you called your mom?
[01:13:40.548 --> 01:13:42.129]  And my daughter said, they won't let me.
[01:13:42.249 --> 01:13:43.489]  They won't let me call my mom.
[01:13:43.936 --> 01:13:45.696]  So she said, well, what's your number?
[01:13:46.156 --> 01:13:52.318]  And the parent actually wrote my number down in the palm of her hand with a pen and called me.
[01:13:52.538 --> 01:13:57.199]  So I received the call on my cell phone and she says, the security guards are up here beating up your daughter.
[01:13:57.219 --> 01:13:58.399]  You need to get up here quick.
[01:13:59.339 --> 01:14:05.921]  So I rushed down there and I go into the school and I said, I'm Blige Mervyn's mother.
[01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:09.081]  I understand my daughter has been injured.
[01:14:09.441 --> 01:14:10.722]  Can you please bring her to me?
[01:14:11.382 --> 01:14:12.562]  And they all said,
[01:14:13.154 --> 01:14:14.274]  They didn't know where she was.
[01:14:15.115 --> 01:14:16.995]  They had no clue where she was.
[01:14:17.415 --> 01:14:18.596]  So they said, sit down.
[01:14:18.656 --> 01:14:24.597]  They picked up their walkie-talkies and started pretending that they were looking for her.
[01:14:25.358 --> 01:14:26.838]  And I waited for 15 minutes.
[01:14:27.698 --> 01:14:35.080]  Once 15 minutes had passed, I went to the principal's office and I said, excuse me sir, can you please bring my daughter to me?
[01:14:35.621 --> 01:14:39.962]  And he was working on his computer and he didn't even turn around and acknowledge me.
[01:14:40.953 --> 01:14:43.294]  He just said, oh, I think she went to the restroom.
[01:14:43.914 --> 01:14:53.378]  So I had my other daughter with me, she's 17, and I said to my daughter, I said, Brianna, go to the restroom and see if Bluejay's in there.
[01:14:54.238 --> 01:14:56.019]  So Brianna went to the restroom and came back.
[01:14:56.419 --> 01:14:57.740]  Mom, she's not in the restroom.
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.060]  She's not in the restroom.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.581]  So I went back to his door.
[01:15:00.601 --> 01:15:03.822]  I said, excuse me, sir, my daughter isn't in the restroom.
[01:15:03.922 --> 01:15:06.363]  I need you to bring my daughter to me now.
[01:15:07.504 --> 01:15:09.825]  So I waited for another 10 to 15 minutes.
[01:15:11.317 --> 01:15:12.658]  And they still didn't bring her.
[01:15:12.778 --> 01:15:14.979]  And they're telling me they don't know where she is.
[01:15:15.499 --> 01:15:16.340]  That they don't know.
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:19.141]  And we don't live too far from the school.
[01:15:19.581 --> 01:15:27.726]  So at that point, I started thinking, okay, well maybe she got scared and had a chance to run off campus and maybe she's going home, you know, running home.
[01:15:28.126 --> 01:15:33.829]  Since they're telling me that they don't... Since they were telling me that they didn't know where she was.
[01:15:34.309 --> 01:15:36.190]  So at that point, I said, you know what?
[01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:39.172]  If you guys aren't going to bring me my daughter, I'm going to get her.
[01:15:40.305 --> 01:15:43.486]  My oldest daughter had told me that they had a security room in the back.
[01:15:43.946 --> 01:15:45.746]  So I said, come take me to the room, Brianna.
[01:15:46.227 --> 01:15:54.109]  And as I was going to the school, the assistant principal, he extended his arms and said, no, you just need to wait in the office.
[01:15:54.169 --> 01:16:00.690]  Yeah, they were in there trying to get her to swear out a statement that she'd done something violent to protect themselves after their assault.
[01:16:01.050 --> 01:16:02.511]  Yeah, that's exactly what they were doing.
[01:16:02.531 --> 01:16:04.411]  And plus they were waiting for her to calm down.
[01:16:04.691 --> 01:16:07.252]  They were trying to calm her down and get her to stop crying, you know.
[01:16:07.819 --> 01:16:09.280]  Yeah, after having her arm broken, yeah.
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:10.141]  Exactly.
[01:16:10.321 --> 01:16:11.942]  Which, by the way, will make a grown man cry.
[01:16:12.402 --> 01:16:12.703]  Yes.
[01:16:13.303 --> 01:16:16.725]  So he extended out his arms and said, no, you just need to wait in the office.
[01:16:17.086 --> 01:16:17.726]  I said, you know what?
[01:16:17.846 --> 01:16:18.827]  I've waited long enough.
[01:16:18.887 --> 01:16:20.228]  I'm not waiting any longer.
[01:16:20.308 --> 01:16:22.069]  I'm going to find my daughter.
[01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:24.111]  And I brushed past his arms.
[01:16:24.734 --> 01:16:28.338]  After hearing that she'd been beat up and you get there for 30 minutes, they won't let you see her.
[01:16:28.678 --> 01:16:29.158]  Exactly.
[01:16:29.178 --> 01:16:32.061]  So I'm not really knowing what kind of shape she's in.
[01:16:32.081 --> 01:16:36.225]  And you see, they haven't extincted your good instincts as a mother to not submit to them.
[01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:40.429]  Most people will sit there while they kill their children nowadays.
[01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:42.331]  I'm not kidding.
[01:16:42.451 --> 01:16:43.472]  I mean, it happens all the time.
[01:16:45.513 --> 01:16:51.474]  And so you brush past the God, and then what happened next?
[01:16:51.654 --> 01:16:53.134]  When you got back to her, what did you see?
[01:16:53.675 --> 01:17:00.016]  I went to the back, the one security room that my daughter took me to, and I opened the door, and I look in there, and she's not in there.
[01:17:00.396 --> 01:17:02.536]  So at that point, I got on my phone, I called 911.
[01:17:03.756 --> 01:17:10.778]  I said, my daughter's missing, she's supposed to be at school, I understand the security guards are roughed her up, I need an officer, quick.
[01:17:12.208 --> 01:17:17.351]  And at that point they told me, well one of the other parents, the one who originally called me, had already called 911.
[01:17:17.551 --> 01:17:21.373]  So the 911 operator tells me, we have two cars on the way.
[01:17:22.953 --> 01:17:28.176]  So then they, when they saw me get on the phone call 911, they said, come on, we'll take you to her.
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:32.122]  So they took me to another building way in the back on the other side.
[01:17:32.162 --> 01:17:33.843]  Yeah, they've been lying the whole time, alright.
[01:17:33.943 --> 01:17:34.543]  Exactly.
[01:17:34.704 --> 01:17:35.884]  They knew exactly where she was.
[01:17:35.904 --> 01:17:37.185]  It's all about deception.
[01:17:37.225 --> 01:17:42.368]  A sick, corrupt, unaccountable institution with jail guards in it having their way with your children.
[01:17:42.388 --> 01:17:43.589]  That's government training camps.
[01:17:43.949 --> 01:17:44.609]  Please continue.
[01:17:44.629 --> 01:17:45.690]  You get there, what did you see?
[01:17:46.651 --> 01:17:52.294]  My daughter walks out and she's hysterical and she's crying and they say, well you can walk out this way.
[01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.175]  We don't want you walking back through the school.
[01:17:54.495 --> 01:17:55.035]  That's fine.
[01:17:55.056 --> 01:17:55.796]  So I walked out
[01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:59.721]  I stood in front of the school and waited for the police officers to arrive.
[01:18:00.322 --> 01:18:03.965]  Once the police officers arrived, I demanded that he be arrested.
[01:18:04.145 --> 01:18:04.806]  I demanded.
[01:18:05.206 --> 01:18:07.609]  So he went and talked to me.
[01:18:08.109 --> 01:18:11.552]  At that time, the assistant principal told him that I shoved him.
[01:18:11.672 --> 01:18:12.173]  Stay there.
[01:18:13.574 --> 01:18:13.954]  Stay there.
[01:18:13.995 --> 01:18:14.715]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:21.261 --> 01:18:35.836]  Go tell that long-thumbed liar Go and tell that midnight rider Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter Tell him that God's gonna cut him down Tell him that God's gonna cut him down
[01:18:41.033 --> 01:18:43.775]  Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news.
[01:18:44.156 --> 01:18:46.737]  My head's been wet with the midnight dew.
[01:18:47.338 --> 01:18:51.861]  I've been down on bended knee, talking to the man from Galilee.
[01:18:54.915 --> 01:19:06.163]  Now, you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:19:06.403 --> 01:19:14.368]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:19:14.668 --> 01:19:24.335]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals
[01:19:24.815 --> 01:19:26.976]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[01:19:27.016 --> 01:19:27.276]  Call now.
[01:19:53.268 --> 01:19:57.169]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:19:57.389 --> 01:20:09.673]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:20:10.093 --> 01:20:10.493]  The U.S.
[01:20:10.553 --> 01:20:16.135]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:20:16.515 --> 01:20:18.716]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:20:20.596 --> 01:20:21.657]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:20:21.697 --> 01:20:24.538]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:20:24.638 --> 01:20:30.681]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:20:31.101 --> 01:20:34.463]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:20:34.543 --> 01:20:40.866]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:20:41.446 --> 01:20:45.449]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:20:45.569 --> 01:20:45.750]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:45.990]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.143 --> 01:20:57.224]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[01:20:57.484 --> 01:21:02.545]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[01:21:02.865 --> 01:21:07.486]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[01:21:07.846 --> 01:21:09.806]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[01:21:10.107 --> 01:21:15.968]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[01:21:16.328 --> 01:21:17.028]  And it works.
[01:21:17.552 --> 01:21:18.993]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[01:21:19.373 --> 01:21:20.394]  Now it's your turn.
[01:21:20.654 --> 01:21:23.016]  Today you can get a full bottle of Totinol.
[01:21:23.156 --> 01:21:27.439]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[01:21:27.759 --> 01:21:30.841]  See what Totinol can do for you and your confidence.
[01:21:31.222 --> 01:21:33.423]  It sure gave me something to smile about.

[01:21:48.834 --> 01:21:52.157]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[01:21:52.958 --> 01:21:54.919]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:58.222]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:21:58.482 --> 01:22:03.266]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:22:03.587 --> 01:22:06.329]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:22:06.569 --> 01:22:11.253]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[01:22:11.533 --> 01:22:13.435]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:22:13.895 --> 01:22:23.845]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology, and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[01:22:24.226 --> 01:22:28.930]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.

[01:22:33.034 --> 01:22:35.196]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[01:22:35.517 --> 01:22:37.659]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings,
[01:22:37.839 --> 01:22:43.043]  We'll even refund the shipping charge, share the oil company's secret, and get SFR now!
[01:22:43.263 --> 01:22:44.164]  What are you waiting for?
[01:22:44.344 --> 01:22:47.366]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[01:22:47.727 --> 01:22:50.268]  That's 1-888-873-7371.
[01:22:50.769 --> 01:22:52.290]  Today!
[01:22:54.331 --> 01:22:59.495]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:00.156 --> 01:23:03.178]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:03.999 --> 01:23:05.280]  There's two big issues here.
[01:23:06.687 --> 01:23:11.393]  This security guard did this because that's what they train security guards and police to do now.
[01:23:13.054 --> 01:23:19.682]  They are trained that if someone doesn't submit, that they taser them and taser them and taser them until death.
[01:23:19.762 --> 01:23:21.784]  Usually it's over 10 tasers when people start dying.
[01:23:22.265 --> 01:23:23.006]  Happens all the time.
[01:23:23.606 --> 01:23:26.029]  That they jump on your back of your neck with their knee.
[01:23:26.169 --> 01:23:27.431]  They teach them torture holds.
[01:23:28.464 --> 01:23:33.768]  You know, we put video up and it got 30-something thousand views of police breaking people's arms for paying compliance.
[01:23:34.408 --> 01:23:37.810]  Someone flagged it on the YouTube community so you can't get to it.
[01:23:38.291 --> 01:23:42.353]  But for some reason you can still link through off PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:23:42.394 --> 01:23:43.814]  It's posted with the story.
[01:23:44.175 --> 01:23:48.217]  High school security guards attack teen with cell phone camera and then frame him.
[01:23:48.258 --> 01:23:49.779]  It's also in the original story we did.
[01:23:50.219 --> 01:23:51.680]  School guards break child's arm.
[01:23:52.777 --> 01:23:53.297]  I don't know.
[01:24:16.978 --> 01:24:20.641]  And this has become so widespread that you can't believe anything a cop says.
[01:24:21.202 --> 01:24:25.325]  It doesn't matter that a lot of cops will tell the truth, it's that they've taught them to lie.
[01:24:25.665 --> 01:24:27.066]  Jack McClann will tell you about this.
[01:24:27.687 --> 01:24:30.489]  Most highly decorated police officer, cop of the year twice in Phoenix.
[01:24:30.769 --> 01:24:31.710]  They were taught to lie.
[01:24:32.791 --> 01:24:35.393]  And the general public is starting to figure this out.
[01:24:35.833 --> 01:24:39.256]  Now we have all these squad car videos where they say, I'll frame you, ha ha ha.
[01:24:40.958 --> 01:24:46.222]  So it's gotten so widespread that cops think they're allowed to now.
[01:24:47.799 --> 01:24:53.542]  Going back to the mother of this young girl that had this done to her, Latricia Majors.
[01:24:56.064 --> 01:25:00.146]  Latricia, where is... Okay, so at that point, you say, I want them arrested.
[01:25:00.166 --> 01:25:00.987]  The cop goes in.
[01:25:01.027 --> 01:25:02.228]  He's not going to side with you.
[01:25:02.628 --> 01:25:05.149]  You could have video tape of them chopping children's heads off.
[01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:07.070]  They'd arrest you for chopping their heads off.
[01:25:07.331 --> 01:25:08.111]  What happened next?
[01:25:08.972 --> 01:25:14.595]  Well, the police officer went and spoke to the assistant principal, and he told him that I shoved him.
[01:25:15.219 --> 01:25:17.921]  So the officer comes back over and says, you know what?
[01:25:18.482 --> 01:25:24.346]  Well, if you want him, if you want Chris arrested, then you're going to be arrested as well.
[01:25:24.506 --> 01:25:25.347]  And I go, for what?
[01:25:26.188 --> 01:25:26.888]  For battery.
[01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:30.531]  The assistant principal said that you pushed him, you shoved him.
[01:25:31.152 --> 01:25:31.592]  And I had
[01:25:32.359 --> 01:25:33.239]  I don't think so.
[01:25:52.248 --> 01:25:54.950]  So see, I mean, we are literally like pathetic slaves, folks.
[01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:56.290]  We are pathetic.
[01:25:56.771 --> 01:25:59.192]  This is a pathetic country.
[01:25:59.492 --> 01:26:03.594]  I have cops on tape, just when crowds are out, just get out of there, move it!
[01:26:04.074 --> 01:26:04.715]  Move it!
[01:26:04.755 --> 01:26:06.636]  But it's okay for them to, though.
[01:26:07.476 --> 01:26:10.118]  They'll probably start getting little whips, like it's a slave pit.
[01:26:10.158 --> 01:26:11.838]  They'll start swacking us with whips.
[01:26:11.878 --> 01:26:13.860]  Okay, so, but then he didn't arrest him, did he?
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:15.420]  No, he didn't.
[01:26:15.981 --> 01:26:16.661]  No, he didn't.
[01:26:17.121 --> 01:26:20.383]  And so then he said, well, you know what, I'm just going to make out a report.
[01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:28.434]  And he actually gave me the white slip, the report form to call and get the report in three to five days.
[01:26:28.755 --> 01:26:37.340]  So that lets you know he had no intentions on arresting me because he wrote out, he said he was going to make a report and actually gave me the slip with the file number and everything on it.
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:40.441]  So at that point I said, you know what, that's not good enough.
[01:26:40.642 --> 01:26:41.862]  I want him arrested.
[01:26:42.203 --> 01:26:43.984]  I need to see a sergeant now.
[01:26:44.724 --> 01:26:48.086]  And so he looked at me and he said, oh, you want a sergeant?
[01:26:48.426 --> 01:26:49.647]  You're going to get a sergeant.
[01:26:50.726 --> 01:26:52.307]  See, it's all about who's got the power.
[01:26:52.327 --> 01:26:53.728]  It's like that other cop says on tape.
[01:26:53.748 --> 01:26:55.249]  He goes, I've got the power.
[01:26:55.330 --> 01:26:56.150]  I'm going to frame you.
[01:26:56.410 --> 01:26:58.712]  You're going to learn that I can frame you, little man.
[01:26:59.092 --> 01:26:59.393]  Yes.
[01:27:00.533 --> 01:27:01.594]  And that's what it's all about.
[01:27:01.634 --> 01:27:03.676]  It's all about they've got the power.
[01:27:03.876 --> 01:27:05.977]  You don't have the power over the vaccines, cop.
[01:27:06.178 --> 01:27:08.840]  You don't have the power over the food you drink, the poisonous water.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:11.742]  You don't have power over the IRS, the New World Order.
[01:27:11.762 --> 01:27:12.662]  You're just like us.
[01:27:12.863 --> 01:27:14.224]  You're a slave too, cop.
[01:27:14.524 --> 01:27:15.184]  Exactly.
[01:27:16.025 --> 01:27:19.948]  And I believe they called a sergeant that they knew would arrest us.
[01:27:20.509 --> 01:27:23.230]  Because once the sergeant got there, he was very rude.
[01:27:23.690 --> 01:27:24.810]  You know, very rude.
[01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:27.831]  They all stood in a little huddle and talked.
[01:27:28.391 --> 01:27:31.512]  And then the next thing I know, we were just all being handcuffed.
[01:27:33.632 --> 01:27:34.533]  All being handcuffed?
[01:27:34.553 --> 01:27:35.833]  They just shot at us?
[01:27:35.873 --> 01:27:39.194]  They handcuffed us, all four of us, at the same time.
[01:27:39.234 --> 01:27:43.415]  They just rushed us and each one of them had one of us just handcuffing us.
[01:27:44.239 --> 01:27:47.060]  Now, they handcuffed your daughter even after her arm was broken?
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:48.081]  Oh yes, yes.
[01:27:48.281 --> 01:27:49.021]  Pure torture?
[01:27:49.361 --> 01:27:49.621]  Yes.
[01:27:50.002 --> 01:27:50.522]  Unbelievable.
[01:27:50.542 --> 01:27:51.842]  This country's so gone, folks.
[01:27:53.023 --> 01:27:53.743]  Yes, they did.
[01:27:54.383 --> 01:27:56.264]  Were they saying, you got what you wanted now, lady?
[01:27:56.924 --> 01:28:04.648]  No, one of the police officers did mention something about, well, when you drag stuff on, this is what happens.
[01:28:04.708 --> 01:28:06.008]  Like, we should have left it alone.
[01:28:06.428 --> 01:28:06.749]  You know?
[01:28:06.969 --> 01:28:08.269]  See, we're under them now.
[01:28:10.876 --> 01:28:12.897]  You see, we're under them.
[01:28:12.957 --> 01:28:13.677]  They're the gods.
[01:28:13.717 --> 01:28:14.918]  They work for the corrupt government.
[01:28:17.379 --> 01:28:17.899]  Absolutely.
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:20.500]  And there's the proof, folks.
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:21.300]  It's all on video.
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:22.361]  Nobody assaulted anybody.
[01:28:23.161 --> 01:28:24.822]  Her case isn't on video that we know.
[01:28:24.862 --> 01:28:27.003]  I bet they got school cameras, though, but they won't show that.
[01:28:27.543 --> 01:28:28.483]  But we know of the others.
[01:28:28.523 --> 01:28:29.644]  They didn't touch this god.
[01:28:30.672 --> 01:28:31.313]  Four people.
[01:28:32.193 --> 01:28:33.414]  They had the witnesses out there.
[01:28:33.434 --> 01:28:36.597]  Oh, the cameraman, his sister, they're going to tell the story.
[01:28:36.857 --> 01:28:38.358]  Oh, you're going to be a witness?
[01:28:38.938 --> 01:28:40.480]  How about we throw a charge on you?
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:40.900]  Stay there.
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:43.282]  I want to come back and try to get you some support.
[01:28:43.402 --> 01:28:44.342]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.362 --> 01:28:46.444]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.464 --> 01:28:49.987]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.604 --> 01:28:56.545]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:28:56.705 --> 01:29:01.886]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:29:02.226 --> 01:29:07.507]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:29:07.947 --> 01:29:09.068]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:29:09.428 --> 01:29:18.410]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:29:18.730 --> 01:29:20.332]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:29:20.592 --> 01:29:24.757]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[01:29:53.962 --> 01:30:02.007]  Hi, this is Jeff Rents, and if you're interested in suppressed natural cures and rare exotic remedies, this may be the most important message you'll hear for a long time.
[01:30:02.407 --> 01:30:11.713]  There's an opportunity right now for a limited number of listeners to acquire an amazing, blacklisted, naturally occurring compound with very unusual ionic properties.
[01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:16.396]  In fact, it's considered the single most important remedy in all of Ayurvedic medicine.
[01:30:16.876 --> 01:30:28.959]  Medical studies have been conducted abroad on the effects this rare mineral-like compound has on energy, diabetes, tumors, ulcers, memory and brain function, not to mention reproductive health, exercise recovery and arthritis.
[01:30:29.259 --> 01:30:34.200]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made.
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:37.921]  However, it's still quite legal to own this compound, and the best part?
[01:30:38.301 --> 01:30:39.801]  My listeners pay nothing down.
[01:30:39.881 --> 01:30:42.262]  Simply go to blacklistedherb.com.
[01:30:42.282 --> 01:30:44.222]  That's blacklistedherb.com.
[01:30:44.642 --> 01:30:45.043]  Or call 815-259-4552.
[01:30:45.063 --> 01:30:45.884]  That's 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:30:53.286 --> 01:30:55.008]  It's not a matter of if, but when.
[01:30:55.368 --> 01:30:58.731]  If it happens, you want to be ready to give your loved ones a fighting chance.
[01:30:59.012 --> 01:31:03.456]  Do not rely on someone else to come through for you at a time when it could be about life and death.
[01:31:03.856 --> 01:31:08.841]  Your best chance is Safe Castle Royal, the premier crisis preparedness buyers club out there.
[01:31:09.181 --> 01:31:15.367]  Members get everything at rock bottom pricing, with at least 20% off everything in our store all the time, and free shipping.
[01:31:15.387 --> 01:31:15.787]  We're good.
[01:31:32.214 --> 01:31:33.214]  We don't need no education
[01:32:02.903 --> 01:32:06.245]  We don't need no thought control.
[01:32:06.305 --> 01:32:10.727]  No sarcasm in the classroom.
[01:32:10.808 --> 01:32:13.789]  Teacher leave their kids alone.
[01:32:36.333 --> 01:32:50.118]  And that song goes on to say that the teachers would beat and abuse the students and they'd go home at night and their fat and psychopathic wives would beat them within inches of their lives.
[01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:58.301]  Now we don't need your brainwashing anymore.
[01:33:07.461 --> 01:33:14.847]  Hey, government brainwasher!
[01:33:15.148 --> 01:33:16.929]  We're on to you!
[01:33:40.283 --> 01:33:42.705]  All in all, it's just another brick in the wall!
[01:33:43.045 --> 01:33:44.226]  We know who the enemy is!
[01:33:49.110 --> 01:33:51.052]  Alright, I'm gonna stop ranting.
[01:33:51.072 --> 01:33:54.395]  We're gonna go back to our guest here and hopefully get her some support.
[01:33:54.475 --> 01:33:56.456]  Turns out Cochran's firm isn't helping her yet.
[01:33:57.697 --> 01:33:59.399]  This happens every second in this country.
[01:34:01.357 --> 01:34:04.999]  We have to store food for our families if we're going to stay free and stay alive.
[01:34:05.179 --> 01:34:19.685]  When we see the term useless eaters used against the undesirables, whether they are old folks, the sick, poor, Christians, ethnic groups, or political dissenters, it doesn't leave any question in the mind as to whether food is intended as the control mechanism of choice.
[01:34:20.665 --> 01:34:25.747]  Food has been, is now, and forever will be, the international media of power.
[01:34:26.428 --> 01:34:29.009]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread,
[01:34:29.725 --> 01:34:31.486]  Do what it takes to store food now.
[01:34:32.507 --> 01:34:35.589]  I've got mine, and you need to get yours.
[01:34:36.249 --> 01:34:37.129]  On the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:34:37.169 --> 01:34:38.490]  That's eFoodsDirect.com or call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:34:38.951 --> 01:34:39.931]  That's 1-800-409-5633. eFoodsDirect.
[01:34:39.951 --> 01:34:42.353]  They have the best horrible foods out there, bar none.
[01:34:42.433 --> 01:34:45.414]  Big giant banners on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:59.355 --> 01:34:59.655]  I think so.
[01:35:17.159 --> 01:35:17.999]  It's just amazing.
[01:35:37.586 --> 01:35:54.573]  Detoxing effects, improved digestion, immune system support, healthy blood sugar, improved liver function, helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels, healthy radiant skin, reduce food cravings, it's got the plankton in it, all the good stuff, greater mental clarity, 20 power packed ingredients, weight loss.
[01:35:55.373 --> 01:35:59.935]  Folks, give them a call 1-866-762-9238 or interfood.com.
[01:36:00.515 --> 01:36:03.737]  Alright, going back to our guest, Latricia Majors.
[01:36:04.457 --> 01:36:07.158]  Latricia, okay, so they arrest you, where do they take you?
[01:36:08.283 --> 01:36:16.070]  They took me to the Lancaster Sheriff and told me, they said they were going to give me a citation and release me.
[01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:22.435]  But one of the police officers by the name of Riddle came there and told them to hold me for 8 hours.
[01:36:22.495 --> 01:36:25.338]  So I was released like 4.30am in the morning.
[01:36:25.618 --> 01:36:27.159]  So just a little added pleasure.
[01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:27.700]  Yes.
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:29.241]  All sticking together.
[01:36:29.261 --> 01:36:29.441]  Yes.
[01:36:32.094 --> 01:36:33.775]  All right, and so they held you eight hours.
[01:36:33.795 --> 01:36:34.535]  What about your daughter?
[01:36:34.575 --> 01:36:35.456]  Who was out to get her?
[01:36:35.476 --> 01:36:39.037]  Uh, my mom and my sister were there, uh, to get her.
[01:36:39.458 --> 01:36:42.859]  They actually gave her a ticket also for littering, for dropping the cake.
[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:46.161]  That's right, littering.
[01:36:46.481 --> 01:36:46.721]  Yes.
[01:36:48.162 --> 01:36:49.282]  Well, they white glove everybody.
[01:36:49.302 --> 01:36:52.183]  These schools are induction grounds for the prisons.
[01:36:52.864 --> 01:36:57.066]  That's the only industry we're going to have left at 25 cents an hour versus the Chinese slave goods.
[01:36:58.246 --> 01:36:59.427]  That's, by the way, the official plan.
[01:37:00.524 --> 01:37:03.307]  You think $4 million behind bars, $7 million in the system is something?
[01:37:03.647 --> 01:37:04.908]  It's going to get a lot worse, America.
[01:37:04.928 --> 01:37:07.932]  Besides, where are we going to put everybody when there's no jobs?
[01:37:10.294 --> 01:37:10.955]  Absolutely.
[01:37:11.836 --> 01:37:19.905]  What do you think of 63% of the people in prison for drugs being black when blacks are only 13% of the population?
[01:37:25.061 --> 01:37:27.864]  The statistics doesn't add up.
[01:37:28.044 --> 01:37:37.013]  We have a real crisis going on and we need to take a closer look at what's going on as far as the drug industry as well.
[01:37:37.033 --> 01:37:42.159]  A lot of people don't believe that discrimination is going on.
[01:37:43.195 --> 01:37:43.575]  It is.
[01:37:43.675 --> 01:37:44.696]  It's alive and well.
[01:37:44.776 --> 01:37:48.278]  Well, if you're Rush Limbaugh taking 100 heroin pills a day, you're going to be fine.
[01:37:48.558 --> 01:37:49.979]  Oh, exactly.
[01:37:50.279 --> 01:37:57.003]  But if you're a zip-faced white kid or black kid and you've got a marijuana cigarette, you're going to be spending maybe six months in jail the next time you will.
[01:37:57.603 --> 01:38:00.005]  Now, let's walk through this because I want to let you go.
[01:38:00.045 --> 01:38:00.765]  I know you're busy.
[01:38:01.666 --> 01:38:04.687]  What do other parents say when going on to school?
[01:38:05.788 --> 01:38:10.711]  Well, you know, Friday when we have the rally, a lot of parents came out and there were
[01:38:11.621 --> 01:38:13.662]  So many different stories, you know.
[01:38:14.443 --> 01:38:20.707]  I even recall my daughters coming home last year and just telling me about some things that they witnessed.
[01:38:21.227 --> 01:38:24.949]  About the security guards slamming the boy up against the wall and busting his mouth.
[01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:29.472]  You know, they've been coming home and telling me stories and I was just appalled, you know.
[01:38:29.752 --> 01:38:33.855]  Yeah, these are real, these are real, these are real tough guys.
[01:38:34.135 --> 01:38:35.036]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:35.576 --> 01:38:38.338]  So it's been going on for quite some time.
[01:38:39.072 --> 01:38:45.774]  The school is now holding a meeting today, you know, after it's been all over the news.
[01:38:45.854 --> 01:38:48.015]  Now they want to talk and hear parents' concerns.
[01:38:48.495 --> 01:38:49.215]  You know, the U.S.
[01:38:49.235 --> 01:39:01.259]  Department of Justice and the superintendent, the mayor, and the captain of the sheriff's department, they're all going to be down there today at 3.30 so they can maybe address some of our concerns, but you know, yeah, now it's been
[01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:06.882]  They only want to listen to us.
[01:39:06.902 --> 01:39:08.644]  Well, they just want to act like they listen to you.
[01:39:08.665 --> 01:39:12.289]  You need to get up and say, I was framed and falsely charged.
[01:39:12.509 --> 01:39:13.570]  Here are the two big issues.
[01:39:14.912 --> 01:39:17.035]  You get up and you say, it has been in the news.
[01:39:18.467 --> 01:39:24.855]  That there has been pain compliance deaths with tasers and with nunchucks right there by the way in Southern California.
[01:39:25.736 --> 01:39:28.279]  My daughter was tortured for not cleaning up the cake.
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:29.941]  She didn't touch him.
[01:39:30.502 --> 01:39:33.546]  He assaulted her and broke her arm.
[01:39:33.646 --> 01:39:34.948]  Serious bodily injury.
[01:39:35.746 --> 01:39:38.508]  Then she was falsely charged when I demanded he be arrested.
[01:39:38.528 --> 01:39:39.489]  This is all on record.
[01:39:40.089 --> 01:39:41.491]  It's now a national issue.
[01:39:41.851 --> 01:39:46.374]  So you need to sit up here and tell us you're sorry and you do all this for our own good.
[01:39:46.855 --> 01:39:49.257]  We need to have the charges dropped on us.
[01:39:49.277 --> 01:39:50.177]  Exactly.
[01:39:50.337 --> 01:39:51.939]  And this man needs to be fired.
[01:39:52.999 --> 01:39:54.661]  And if you want to get out of it quick.
[01:39:54.941 --> 01:39:57.523]  And I'll be happy to sign an agreement saying I'm not going to sue you.
[01:39:57.863 --> 01:39:59.945]  But say you don't want this on your soul.
[01:40:00.385 --> 01:40:01.626]  Falsely charging us.
[01:40:01.746 --> 01:40:02.587]  Everybody witnessed it.
[01:40:02.627 --> 01:40:03.768]  Everybody knows what happened.
[01:40:04.569 --> 01:40:10.934]  And so again, A, your daughter was tortured and had her arm broken for no reason.
[01:40:12.335 --> 01:40:20.621]  And B, then when you demanded something be done, you were arrested along with the video person and his sister.
[01:40:21.161 --> 01:40:27.366]  And that this has been a great evil that's happened and that the system needs to stop defending itself.
[01:40:28.327 --> 01:40:31.589]  And you need to tell all the parents too that they're there to pacify them.
[01:40:33.035 --> 01:40:34.455]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[01:40:34.895 --> 01:40:43.197]  Also, I know it's hard, you know, you work for the school district and you don't make a lot of money, but it'd be better for children to not even go to school than to be in government training camps.
[01:40:43.577 --> 01:40:48.159]  It'd be better for children to just go get jobs working behind a counter and then reading books on their own.
[01:40:48.399 --> 01:40:49.599]  You're not going to learn anything in school.
[01:40:49.919 --> 01:41:00.081]  They learn how to use drugs, they learn how to go to prison, they learn how to dress like whores, they learn how to serve world government, and I'm just telling you, everybody needs to get their children out of these camps.
[01:41:00.602 --> 01:41:02.562]  I mean, you certainly can't put your daughter back in that camp.
[01:41:04.041 --> 01:41:05.242]  No, I'm going through that now.
[01:41:05.262 --> 01:41:11.067]  I told them that I didn't think that she would be able to continue her education there.
[01:41:11.948 --> 01:41:19.714]  Because, you know, I hold the principles at fault, the system principles, because although they didn't do it, they sat around and watched it being done.
[01:41:19.774 --> 01:41:21.496]  So they're just as guilty.
[01:41:21.876 --> 01:41:23.037]  Oh, they love it.
[01:41:23.137 --> 01:41:27.541]  Now, when they broke her wrist, how long was she in cuffs when they put the
[01:41:28.385 --> 01:41:29.626]  You know, because she should have been transferred.
[01:41:29.646 --> 01:41:30.807]  By the way, that's a major tort.
[01:41:31.167 --> 01:41:34.871]  She should have been transferred via ambulance with a broken wrist.
[01:41:34.991 --> 01:41:35.391]  Exactly.
[01:41:35.491 --> 01:41:38.394]  And I stated that to the police that she needed medical attention.
[01:41:39.494 --> 01:41:40.695]  What, they did just laugh?
[01:41:41.616 --> 01:41:42.157]  Basically.
[01:41:43.318 --> 01:41:43.838]  Basically.
[01:41:43.858 --> 01:41:50.043]  And she was in cuffs for, uh, let's see, they transported her from Palmdale to Lancaster.
[01:41:50.063 --> 01:41:53.006]  That's a good, uh, 15 minute drive.
[01:41:53.737 --> 01:41:59.600]  But they pulled over on the way there and transported us from one police car into another police car.
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:01.461]  So that took about five or ten minutes.
[01:42:02.602 --> 01:42:03.762]  And then we got to the station.
[01:42:03.782 --> 01:42:06.884]  Well, but that was excruciating to have handcuffs on with a broken wrist.
[01:42:07.164 --> 01:42:07.384]  Oh.
[01:42:07.784 --> 01:42:08.885]  How many bones did it break?
[01:42:09.025 --> 01:42:09.485]  One or both?
[01:42:11.406 --> 01:42:11.826]  You know what?
[01:42:11.886 --> 01:42:12.467]  I'm not sure.
[01:42:12.487 --> 01:42:13.387]  I didn't ask.
[01:42:14.308 --> 01:42:16.269]  The doctor just told me that it was broken.
[01:42:16.289 --> 01:42:18.710]  And he showed me the x-ray.
[01:42:19.450 --> 01:42:20.531]  Well, think back to the x-ray.
[01:42:20.571 --> 01:42:22.892]  Was there a crack in both of the bones or one?
[01:42:24.949 --> 01:42:26.350]  You know what, it's foggy now.
[01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:27.131]  I'm not sure.
[01:42:27.451 --> 01:42:31.395]  Is there a way you can get those x-rays and scan them and mail them to me or email them?
[01:42:31.975 --> 01:42:32.956]  I can try to do that.
[01:42:33.056 --> 01:42:34.237]  Just ask them for duplicates.
[01:42:34.457 --> 01:42:36.759]  I'd like to post that on the web.
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:37.580]  Okay.
[01:42:38.601 --> 01:42:40.022]  Well, listen, how do we support you?
[01:42:40.203 --> 01:42:40.923]  How can we help you?
[01:42:40.943 --> 01:42:47.209]  I'm sorry that Johnny Cochran and them, I mean, Johnny Cochran's firm hasn't taken the case yet.
[01:42:47.689 --> 01:42:49.791]  How do we get you some support or, I mean, what do you need?
[01:42:49.811 --> 01:42:51.993]  Just, how can we help you?
[01:42:52.703 --> 01:42:56.687]  Well, you know, I'm very grateful for everyone's support.
[01:42:58.268 --> 01:43:08.558]  You know, now what I'm basically concerned with is getting my daughter in some counseling, which I've done, you know, because she's traumatized behind this, you know.
[01:43:08.578 --> 01:43:11.421]  Don't let them put her on Ritalin or Prozac!
[01:43:11.581 --> 01:43:12.702]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:43:12.982 --> 01:43:13.783]  Definitely not.
[01:43:13.943 --> 01:43:14.664]  Definitely not.
[01:43:15.627 --> 01:43:17.430]  Um, you know, I'm kind of concerned with now.
[01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:18.571]  I'm without a doubt.
[01:43:18.611 --> 01:43:24.358]  Listen, you tell your daughter to buck up that they're criminals and then you tell her to buck up and win in life.
[01:43:24.378 --> 01:43:25.519]  You tell your daughter this from me.
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:29.925]  The best revenge, it's a French saying, the best revenge is living well.
[01:43:31.073 --> 01:43:42.767]  The best revenge is her growing up straight and strong, not getting out with bad men, not being used in life, being strong and being successful and working extra hours and being successful in life and being a winner.
[01:43:43.267 --> 01:43:47.112]  Long after that fat hog has got a horrible life.
[01:43:47.839 --> 01:43:48.240]  I will, I will.
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:49.561]  Great advice, great advice.
[01:44:03.332 --> 01:44:05.653]  I mean, just think of how miserable that pig's gotta be.
[01:44:06.593 --> 01:44:07.253]  Absolutely.
[01:44:07.633 --> 01:44:10.394]  And growing up being little, I never knew what black folks mean by pig.
[01:44:10.454 --> 01:44:11.695]  But I mean, he looks like a pig.
[01:44:11.915 --> 01:44:12.855]  They act like pigs.
[01:44:12.915 --> 01:44:17.676]  By pig, they're just big, hoggish, hateful, giggling, snorting pig demons.
[01:44:17.696 --> 01:44:28.019]  Yeah, this has caused a real hardship, you know, for me and my family because, you know, I already live in check to check.
[01:44:28.319 --> 01:44:29.640]  I can't go two months
[01:44:30.666 --> 01:44:32.187]  Without pay, you know.
[01:44:32.327 --> 01:44:33.867]  That's going to be a real hardship.
[01:44:34.047 --> 01:44:35.788]  And they're doing this for mothers everywhere.
[01:44:35.808 --> 01:44:39.490]  Well, do you want to give people your phone number or address if they want to try to help you?
[01:44:40.150 --> 01:44:40.470]  Sure.
[01:44:41.991 --> 01:44:42.931]  Sure.
[01:44:43.091 --> 01:44:46.673]  It's area code 661-992-7173.
[01:44:46.773 --> 01:44:49.894]  Give it again, please.
[01:44:49.914 --> 01:44:51.415]  661-992-7173.
[01:44:52.355 --> 01:44:56.597]  Now, I know your daughter's wrist is broken, but I'll tell you how she beats them.
[01:44:57.177 --> 01:44:58.878]  She goes and she gets a job.
[01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:13.275]  And instead of watching television, like, tell her, make money, help her momma out, and, uh, I mean, that's how you beat these people, is you just work harder, and you get in a position of power, so you can protect yourself and your family.
[01:45:13.975 --> 01:45:14.515]  Definitely.
[01:45:14.595 --> 01:45:19.757]  That's the only reason to make money, is so you got money to sue these people, and money to protect yourself.
[01:45:19.777 --> 01:45:20.697]  Absolutely.
[01:45:21.017 --> 01:45:23.618]  It's not about baubles and trinkets, it's about protecting your family.
[01:45:23.638 --> 01:45:24.859]  Give your number out again.
[01:45:30.344 --> 01:45:39.230]  I'll also ask people to pray for you that the right thing be done, that God move these people's hearts, not to bear false witness, which is a mortal sin, by the way, very evil.
[01:45:39.251 --> 01:45:41.652]  It's in the Ten Commandments, folks, one of the big ten.
[01:45:41.672 --> 01:45:42.553]  It's as bad as murder.
[01:45:43.193 --> 01:45:52.540]  Falsely accusing, falsely charging is ultra-wicked, ultra-evil, and you don't repent of it, you're damned to hell when you die.
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:56.683]  And bottom line, it's not too late for them to do the right thing.
[01:45:57.899 --> 01:46:04.020]  And, uh, where is this located at 3.30 today so some of our listeners can come to it?
[01:46:04.581 --> 01:46:08.962]  It's going to be at the high school, at Pete Knight High School in Palmdale.
[01:46:10.822 --> 01:46:14.343]  Alright, I'm telling folks to go there with cameras, to get it up on YouTube, we'll link to it.
[01:46:14.803 --> 01:46:20.104]  Because, again, each story is international in scope because it shows their modus operandi.
[01:46:20.344 --> 01:46:24.405]  They falsely torture someone, then falsely accuse them to cover up what they've done.
[01:46:25.456 --> 01:46:26.097]  Absolutely.
[01:46:26.277 --> 01:46:30.500]  Just like 30-something percent of people on death row are totally innocent now with the DNA.
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:35.723]  This government is totally criminal and cannot be trusted to clean toilets, much less raise children.
[01:46:36.104 --> 01:46:36.864]  God bless you, Ms.
[01:46:37.745 --> 01:46:39.666]  Majors, and we'll be praying for you.
[01:46:40.066 --> 01:46:42.588]  Thank you for all of your support, and thanks for having me on.
[01:46:42.848 --> 01:46:43.109]  You bet.
[01:46:43.149 --> 01:46:44.550]  We're trying to support you best we can.
[01:46:44.590 --> 01:46:44.930]  Take care.
[01:46:50.854 --> 01:46:53.196]  You see, if they wouldn't have destroyed all these communities,
[01:46:54.908 --> 01:47:01.394]  90% of the time, 90 plus percent of the time, a man would be in the house, there'd be more money, and that child wouldn't be in a public school.
[01:47:01.414 --> 01:47:07.039]  But they break the families up, the woman's got to work, they put the child in a government camp, where they prep them for prison.
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:09.761]  And I got the internal federal documents.
[01:47:10.341 --> 01:47:11.622]  It's all prepping for prison.
[01:47:12.463 --> 01:47:17.547]  Prepping for prison or for the new world order system and what job they're going to have.
[01:47:19.029 --> 01:47:22.872]  Folks, if you don't have a lot of money, stop going out to eat.
[01:47:24.523 --> 01:47:26.625]  Stop buying big screen television.
[01:47:26.685 --> 01:47:27.946]  Stop taking everybody to the movies.
[01:47:28.326 --> 01:47:30.427]  Explain to your children they're under enemy attack.
[01:47:31.248 --> 01:47:32.929]  Then they won't care about bibles anymore.
[01:47:32.949 --> 01:47:34.630]  You've got to address it right.
[01:47:34.971 --> 01:47:37.472]  Use the tribal initiative, the warning.
[01:47:37.552 --> 01:47:38.773]  Predators are after you.
[01:47:39.154 --> 01:47:40.495]  You've got to do what I say.
[01:47:40.875 --> 01:47:41.755]  I'll keep you safe.
[01:47:42.216 --> 01:47:45.198]  I'm going to make you a leader to protect yourself from the enemy.
[01:47:46.179 --> 01:47:47.840]  This is the way you teach them.
[01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:50.662]  And if you don't do the programming, the state and the media and the government will.
[01:47:51.661 --> 01:47:54.442]  And then you go out and you take your children to a soup kitchen.
[01:47:54.462 --> 01:47:55.562]  You show them poor people.
[01:47:56.002 --> 01:47:58.883]  You explain to them they're going to end up homeless if they don't get their act together.
[01:48:00.023 --> 01:48:02.804]  You take them into hospitals and you show them people that are sick.
[01:48:03.164 --> 01:48:05.404]  Don't do it until they're about five or six.
[01:48:05.444 --> 01:48:06.185]  So they can understand.
[01:48:06.225 --> 01:48:08.525]  You take them and you show them what drugs and cigarettes will do.
[01:48:09.905 --> 01:48:11.126]  Take them to a cancer ward.
[01:48:12.726 --> 01:48:16.367]  And you take them out and you show them what the police are doing.
[01:48:19.286 --> 01:48:23.749]  And you show them how sick and degenerate and falling apart this society is.
[01:48:25.670 --> 01:48:30.334]  And you explain to them to keep their head down, dress nice, keep their mouth shut.
[01:48:31.194 --> 01:48:35.457]  You teach them they're better than the average scum out there that doesn't know anything and wants to be slaves.
[01:48:37.799 --> 01:48:39.560]  And believe me, they'll stop rebelling against you.
[01:48:40.961 --> 01:48:43.663]  And listen, you sell one of your cars if you got to.
[01:48:44.803 --> 01:48:48.446]  And one of you, I don't care if it's the man or the woman, one of you better stop working
[01:48:49.088 --> 01:48:51.510]  And one of them better discipline those children and get them in order.
[01:48:52.111 --> 01:48:54.933]  And homeschool them or send them to a good private school if you got the money.
[01:48:54.953 --> 01:48:55.994]  There's still some good ones left.
[01:48:56.275 --> 01:48:58.336]  Most of them have been taken over by federal curriculum.
[01:48:59.097 --> 01:49:01.219]  And you keep them out of the system at all costs.
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:05.463]  When you put your child in a public school, you're putting them in a piranha tank.
[01:49:07.690 --> 01:49:08.470]  95% of the time.
[01:49:08.791 --> 01:49:11.833]  Are there some super rich school districts that are okay?
[01:49:12.053 --> 01:49:12.353]  Yeah.
[01:49:12.914 --> 01:49:21.540]  But still, your child's gonna learn how to be promiscuous and how to use drugs and learn how to be super preppy and feel inadequate and be with a bunch of social sharks.
[01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:22.401]  That's even worse.
[01:49:23.061 --> 01:49:24.963]  So when you look at that, there's no good schools.
[01:49:25.643 --> 01:49:26.344]  There's none.
[01:49:26.684 --> 01:49:28.345]  The society's collapsing.
[01:49:28.686 --> 01:49:29.867]  Evil is on the rise.
[01:49:30.127 --> 01:49:31.888]  Degeneracy is taking over.
[01:49:32.088 --> 01:49:33.469]  The FEMA camps are built.
[01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:35.551]  Get your children out now.
[01:49:36.653 --> 01:49:38.434]  And men, don't tell me you don't have the money.
[01:49:38.695 --> 01:49:44.619]  Stop drinking the beer, stop being lazy, and you go work three jobs to get your children out of those camps!
[01:49:45.039 --> 01:49:45.900]  That's your job!
[01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:49.743]  You work yourselves to death, and that's what it takes, you lazy trash!
[01:49:56.554 --> 01:50:02.040]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.401 --> 01:50:10.009]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:17.783]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.183 --> 01:50:29.568]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.908 --> 01:50:33.830]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:35.811]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.151 --> 01:50:39.993]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:54.264 --> 01:51:03.333]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:51:03.573 --> 01:51:14.803]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:15.143 --> 01:51:19.968]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:51:20.188 --> 01:51:20.348]  I think?
[01:51:39.187 --> 01:51:39.608]  Let's go!
[01:51:53.682 --> 01:51:55.503]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:51:55.663 --> 01:52:00.824]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:52:01.004 --> 01:52:02.345]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:52:02.625 --> 01:52:10.787]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:52:11.007 --> 01:52:16.789]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:52:16.809 --> 01:52:18.669]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:52:18.749 --> 01:52:20.870]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:25.315]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:52:25.455 --> 01:52:27.598]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:52:27.698 --> 01:52:35.466]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:52:35.947 --> 01:52:36.267]  We're good.
[01:53:01.118 --> 01:53:03.660]  Your own personal Jesus.
[01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:05.982]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[01:53:06.082 --> 01:53:08.043]  Someone who cares.
[01:53:08.524 --> 01:53:12.246]  Your own personal Jesus.
[01:53:32.285 --> 01:53:34.727]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[01:53:35.188 --> 01:53:36.729]  Someone who says.
[01:53:36.949 --> 01:53:43.375]  Feeling unknown and you're all alone.
[01:53:51.576 --> 01:53:52.397]  Welcome back.
[01:53:52.497 --> 01:53:56.080]  What a nice lady we just talked to.
[01:53:56.141 --> 01:53:57.121]  Surrounded by creditors.
[01:53:57.422 --> 01:53:58.923]  A patriot could have told her.
[01:54:14.206 --> 01:54:19.969]  Don't argue with that scum, act submissive, get out of there, and then wait a few weeks and then come after him legally.
[01:54:20.450 --> 01:54:22.751]  There's no way they would ever arrest that guy.
[01:54:22.771 --> 01:54:26.593]  I mean, that cop, that rent-a-cop could've ice-picked children in the head.
[01:54:26.613 --> 01:54:29.035]  He could barbecue them and fillet them.
[01:54:29.315 --> 01:54:31.396]  They'd charge the children for being filleted.
[01:54:33.317 --> 01:54:35.578]  I mean, that is not how it works.
[01:54:36.459 --> 01:54:37.179]  But she didn't know.
[01:54:37.219 --> 01:54:38.400]  She thought she'd get justice.
[01:54:40.072 --> 01:54:41.493]  And then calling the cops.
[01:54:42.093 --> 01:54:45.775]  That's like if you caught a demon in your basement, you'd call Satan to deal with it.
[01:54:46.676 --> 01:54:47.596]  But people don't know.
[01:54:49.037 --> 01:54:49.637]  They don't know.
[01:54:49.697 --> 01:54:50.458]  They don't understand.
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:56.041]  And again, I'm not saying all police are bad.
[01:54:56.061 --> 01:54:57.122]  I want to make that clear.
[01:54:57.222 --> 01:54:58.662]  The system is bad.
[01:54:59.143 --> 01:55:00.583]  The system is corrupt.
[01:55:00.984 --> 01:55:02.304]  The system is out of control.
[01:55:02.324 --> 01:55:03.165]  And I don't want to hear it.
[01:55:03.903 --> 01:55:07.187]  I mean, Austin Police Department was caught framing people a few years ago.
[01:55:07.227 --> 01:55:09.669]  The Houston Police Department's been caught industrially doing it.
[01:55:10.050 --> 01:55:12.793]  Every case that came through, they didn't even check the hair or blood.
[01:55:12.993 --> 01:55:14.855]  They just certified it as the person.
[01:55:15.756 --> 01:55:18.418]  Then later, they got the samples and did tests, and they admitted it was a fraud.
[01:55:18.679 --> 01:55:22.122]  I've had the former FBI head of the crime lab coming on saying they framed everybody.
[01:55:22.643 --> 01:55:23.944]  Tulia, Texas, framing everybody.
[01:55:24.004 --> 01:55:26.367]  Dallas, all over the news, framing everybody.
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:30.681]  I mean, I can keep going around the rest of the country.
[01:55:31.002 --> 01:55:32.963]  Chicago cops running murder for hire.
[01:55:33.023 --> 01:55:34.084]  Half of them in the mafia.
[01:55:34.865 --> 01:55:37.667]  By half of them, I mean in the detective and special vice squads.
[01:55:38.667 --> 01:55:39.888]  I mean, it's bad, folks.
[01:55:41.069 --> 01:55:43.611]  And then they kill good cops and go after good cops.
[01:55:44.011 --> 01:55:44.852]  This is serious.
[01:55:44.932 --> 01:55:46.613]  I mean, we're in serious trouble.
[01:55:47.094 --> 01:55:48.495]  Just like Burma is right now.
[01:55:48.535 --> 01:55:49.275]  Burma went bad.
[01:55:49.315 --> 01:55:50.036]  We're going bad.
[01:55:50.917 --> 01:55:52.678]  And it's going to be bad for police and everybody else.
[01:55:52.798 --> 01:55:53.679]  I don't hate police.
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:56.541]  But I hate
[01:55:58.038 --> 01:55:58.798]  Pig monsters!
[01:56:00.258 --> 01:56:01.039]  I hate Hitler!
[01:56:02.259 --> 01:56:03.199]  I hate Stalin!
[01:56:03.859 --> 01:56:07.640]  I hate people like the Stasi, who use their power to abuse people.
[01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:08.500]  They're not cops!
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:12.241]  They're not security guards, they're sick thugs!
[01:56:13.241 --> 01:56:15.141]  And they make good cops look bad!
[01:56:17.322 --> 01:56:19.362]  They make good cops look bad!
[01:56:20.563 --> 01:56:27.564]  And the mere fact that the system keeps defending all this means it's going to get worse and worse and worse until the badge is completely
[01:56:28.251 --> 01:56:28.571]  Hated.
[01:56:29.011 --> 01:56:30.091]  And completely discredited.
[01:56:33.312 --> 01:56:34.992]  There are a lot of good police out there, too.
[01:56:35.112 --> 01:56:39.553]  I mean, most cops pull you over, or you got a burglary, and the cops come, they're nice, they're helpful.
[01:56:40.934 --> 01:56:45.415]  But they're unable to get the bad cops off the force in most areas.
[01:56:45.475 --> 01:56:47.075]  Some areas have got good police forces.
[01:56:47.775 --> 01:56:49.896]  Because they've got good police chiefs and good captains.
[01:56:49.936 --> 01:56:53.216]  But in most areas, it's getting worse and worse, and everybody knows it.
[01:56:53.636 --> 01:56:54.897]  I'm out of time for this hour.
[01:56:54.937 --> 01:56:56.757]  We're about to simulcast with Lou Epton.
[01:56:57.739 --> 01:57:03.082]  via his radio station that's out in Las Vegas.
[01:57:05.883 --> 01:57:10.185]  And so I look forward to that starting up and I would imagine that Lou's going to want to talk about this.
[01:57:10.606 --> 01:57:13.007]  FBI thought bombs brought down towers on 9-11.
[01:57:13.187 --> 01:57:17.949]  That's what I'm going to get into next when we start the next hour.
[01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:22.672]  PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.net are just two of the websites.
[01:57:24.111 --> 01:57:29.133]  And we'll come back and talk to Lou Epton on the other side.
[01:57:29.193 --> 01:57:29.713]  Stay with us.
[01:57:32.934 --> 01:57:37.575]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.483 --> 01:57:53.666]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.307 --> 01:57:55.148]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.888 --> 01:57:56.789]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.449 --> 01:58:01.232]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.633 --> 01:58:05.696]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.229 --> 01:58:12.813]  Well, we're now into the third and final hour and Lou Epton's just now firing up his show.
[01:58:12.853 --> 01:58:14.375]  We do this about once a year.
[01:58:14.975 --> 01:58:21.141]  KLAV out of Las Vegas, a fine radio station with a great lineup.
[01:58:21.241 --> 01:58:27.647]  Lou is one of the granddaddies in the Patriot Movement, Truth Movement, Freedom Movement in this country.
[01:58:28.187 --> 01:58:36.231]  I've been interviewing Lou, and he's been interviewing me going back, I don't know, 15 years or so, ever since I first started even getting into this movement, right when I got on air.
[01:58:36.271 --> 01:58:41.614]  I think it was about 13 years, but I'd heard of Lou before that, and we're simulcasting right now.
[01:58:42.174 --> 01:58:43.575]  Lou Epton, are you there, my friend?
[01:58:43.795 --> 01:58:46.436]  Right here, my friend, and it's great to be back with you.
[01:58:46.456 --> 01:58:47.317]  It's been too long.
[01:58:47.917 --> 01:58:50.899]  Well, I'm really honored to be on your show, and it's great to have you here with us.
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:53.121]  What are some of the things you want to talk about this hour?
[01:58:53.141 --> 01:58:56.283]  You know, I've got this big headline up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:56.383 --> 01:58:59.785]  FBI thought bombs brought down towers on 9-11.
[01:58:59.865 --> 01:59:03.207]  Working premise, the truck bombs aided WTC collapse.
[01:59:03.287 --> 01:59:06.510]  Dovetails with arrest reports that were later buried.
[01:59:06.590 --> 01:59:10.152]  Later, if you'd like, in the hour, we can actually play that clip.
[01:59:10.192 --> 01:59:16.476]  In fact, John, why don't you go up to Prison Planet, I forgot to tell you, and go ahead and grab that clip, newscast, so we can play that later.
[01:59:16.696 --> 01:59:17.557]  Lou, what do you think of that?
[01:59:18.137 --> 01:59:18.558]  I love it.
[01:59:18.658 --> 01:59:24.321]  Alex, you know, we think so much alike because I'll never buy what the government wants us to regarding 9-11.
[01:59:25.021 --> 01:59:32.266]  Now what you have and other people I've spoken to, there is not a doubt in my mind that this wasn't something we were heavily involved in.
[01:59:32.286 --> 01:59:37.349]  When I say we, I mean our supposed representatives, our own government.
[01:59:38.745 --> 01:59:47.307]  Well, the reason I bring that up and was talking about it long before 9-11, as you were, is that it's declassified that criminal elements of our government, i.e.
[01:59:47.327 --> 01:59:53.229]  the CIA, Defense Intelligence, staged terror attacks in Iran to blame it on their leadership and overthrow them.
[01:59:53.609 --> 01:59:59.670]  In Europe, they declassified in 2001, before the attacks, that the U.S.
[01:59:59.950 --> 02:00:05.872]  headline planned to stage terror attacks as a pretext for war with Cuba and the Soviets, Operation Northwoods.
[02:00:06.934 --> 02:00:15.402]  The USS Liberty, our government with Israel, staged that attack on the ship as a pretext to attack, of course, the Arabs, mainly
[02:00:17.330 --> 02:00:17.670]  Egypt.
[02:00:17.931 --> 02:00:26.397]  So there's so many examples they now have declassified that it was a staged attack and that nothing really happened that got us into the Vietnam War with the Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:00:26.677 --> 02:00:40.608]  I mean, Lou, there are so many examples where they've done it in the past and then radiating the atomic soldiers, radiating 4,000 American children and killing them in radiation tests, telling parents they were getting x-rays and killing them to test radiation, our government funding Israel to do it.
[02:00:40.888 --> 02:00:44.611]  I mean, the cold-blooded stuff they've done before, why wouldn't they do 9-11?
[02:00:44.651 --> 02:00:47.073]  Then you look at the evidence and sure enough it's an inside
[02:00:47.113 --> 02:00:47.873]  That's my job.
[02:01:02.981 --> 02:01:21.626]  We've been involved in, we've helped plan, it's all taking us toward this one world government, and the latest thing to happen, and I believe it's worth discussion, is what they call the Lost Treaty, the Law of the Seas Treaty, turning most all of the water on the planet over to the United Nations.
[02:01:22.046 --> 02:01:29.250]  I tell you what, we've got a break in a minute and a half, but let's come back, get into this new 9-11 information, and then let's get into these treaties.
[02:01:29.310 --> 02:01:36.853]  Law of the Sea, Law of the Sky, the SPP, the meeting Bush had a month and a half ago, they even released those documents.
[02:01:37.194 --> 02:01:39.275]  We are going under United Nations control!
[02:01:39.635 --> 02:01:40.495]  No question about it.
[02:01:40.535 --> 02:01:44.157]  We've got internment camps right here in our own area of Southern Nevada.
[02:01:44.497 --> 02:01:49.720]  They've got them, I think, mostly all across the nation already for those, well, for folks like you and me.
[02:01:50.669 --> 02:01:51.490]  Well, absolutely.
[02:01:51.590 --> 02:02:00.175]  And, Lou, before we break, tell folks about your fine station, the frequency, and how my listeners, who may have never heard it around the country when they're in Vegas or around it, can tune in.
[02:02:00.615 --> 02:02:01.896]  Okay, thank you, Alex.
[02:02:01.996 --> 02:02:05.958]  KLAV is one of the older stations here in the Southern Nevada market.
[02:02:06.539 --> 02:02:14.183]  It is a unique situation in that they allow people such as yours truly to come on the air and expose what we know to be fraud.
[02:02:14.564 --> 02:02:15.264]  I've been with them.
[02:02:15.284 --> 02:02:17.125]  Well, I started with KLAV back in 1991.
[02:02:19.162 --> 02:02:20.664]  I mean, boy, time goes by.
[02:02:21.124 --> 02:02:24.808]  And they've been absolutely wonderful in every way, shape, and form.
[02:02:25.169 --> 02:02:29.974]  I've gone to a couple of other stations for short periods, but I always keep on coming home.
[02:02:29.994 --> 02:02:31.015]  Well, they're a big station.
[02:02:31.035 --> 02:02:31.936]  They're an old station.
[02:02:31.976 --> 02:02:34.899]  I hear about it all the time, and I listen to clips of you on the web.
[02:02:34.959 --> 02:02:36.200]  Lou Epton, stay there.
[02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:39.604]  We'll be back in three minutes to get into 9-11 and the globalist takeover.
[02:02:46.900 --> 02:02:47.961]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:02:48.261 --> 02:02:51.043]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:02:51.323 --> 02:02:55.465]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:02:55.905 --> 02:02:56.726]  So what do you do?
[02:02:57.046 --> 02:03:01.609]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:03:02.089 --> 02:03:04.231]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:03:04.711 --> 02:03:05.612]  Sheltering in Place!
[02:03:06.012 --> 02:03:19.423]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:03:48.209 --> 02:03:53.693]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:54.053 --> 02:04:01.698]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.375 --> 02:04:09.439]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.839 --> 02:04:21.245]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.565 --> 02:04:25.127]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.508 --> 02:04:27.749]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.789 --> 02:04:31.651]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:50.934 --> 02:04:55.178]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:04:55.599 --> 02:05:02.465]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:02.885 --> 02:05:09.588]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:09.909 --> 02:05:11.529]  There are no reported side effects.

[02:05:38.783 --> 02:05:44.085]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[02:05:46.426 --> 02:05:52.449]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.069 --> 02:05:56.031]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.257 --> 02:06:04.265]  Now, we reported on this years ago, but it broke again this weekend with some new developments, new clips that resurfaced.
[02:06:04.766 --> 02:06:06.188]  So it's big news right now.
[02:06:06.208 --> 02:06:10.814]  FBI thought bombs brought down the towers on 9-11.
[02:06:11.275 --> 02:06:12.797]  Working premise that truck bombs
[02:06:13.277 --> 02:06:18.399]  Aided WTC collapse dovetails with arrest reports that were later buried.
[02:06:18.419 --> 02:06:27.484]  According to Terror Expert interview on USA Today on 9-11, the FBI's initial working premise was that trucks packed with explosives aided the collapse of the Twin Towers.
[02:06:27.524 --> 02:06:35.007]  The fact that dovetails with reports of Middle Easterners being arrested after running away from truck bombs that later exploded that day.
[02:06:35.087 --> 02:06:37.328]  Now, Lou Epton, are you there, my friend?
[02:06:39.049 --> 02:06:39.229]  Here.
[02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:46.342]  Lou, we had Arabs telling the local newspapers the week before those buildings won't be there the next day.
[02:06:46.382 --> 02:06:50.344]  We had Odigo, Haras, reporting in Israel calling and saying, you know, we got a warning.
[02:06:50.364 --> 02:06:53.225]  We told our employees, the Israeli employees, to get out.
[02:06:53.625 --> 02:06:56.026]  We had FBI agents arrested for doing insider trading.
[02:06:56.226 --> 02:07:02.148]  We had Buzzy Kromgaard in trouble with Blackwater covering up arms smuggling right now, involved in insider trading.
[02:07:02.408 --> 02:07:03.789]  It seems like everybody knew
[02:07:04.489 --> 02:07:10.635]  Uh, but then the President said he'd never heard of any such plan, and then on top of it, of course there had to be bombs in the buildings.
[02:07:10.675 --> 02:07:11.596]  I don't believe truck bombs.
[02:07:11.616 --> 02:07:12.477]  They were too well placed.
[02:07:12.497 --> 02:07:13.318]  You can see the squibs.
[02:07:13.618 --> 02:07:24.829]  But at least the FBI, because, you know, a lot of them weren't involved, obviously, it's a compartment of the government, thought there had to be bombs, because it was obvious, and they were reporting that bombs were going off in the towers, including Building 7.
[02:07:25.708 --> 02:07:32.532]  Folks, for the goodness sakes, the firemen, those who survived that horrendous event, are telling us that there were bombs in the building.
[02:07:32.773 --> 02:07:38.836]  I gotta tell you, I've watched buildings come down here in Las Vegas, what they call controlled demolition.
[02:07:39.357 --> 02:07:42.399]  It was identical to what happened at the old Boone's Hotel.
[02:07:42.779 --> 02:07:44.140]  I mean, it came straight down.
[02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:46.201]  The same thing happened with the Twin Towers.
[02:07:46.421 --> 02:07:51.305]  There are so many unanswered questions regarding what really went on that fateful day.
[02:07:52.245 --> 02:07:53.166]  Tons of evidence.
[02:07:53.406 --> 02:07:54.707]  You have tons of evidence.
[02:07:54.967 --> 02:08:04.912]  We both have lots of questions, and there's nobody there to answer them, and the commission they put in place to report on what they say happened was rigged, and we both know it.
[02:08:06.173 --> 02:08:12.897]  I mean, there was no doubt in my mind, and I hate to say this, but there's not a doubt in my mind about what went on
[02:08:13.630 --> 02:08:15.912]  That fateful day of September 11th.
[02:08:15.972 --> 02:08:17.733]  Those buildings were planned for destruction.
[02:08:17.753 --> 02:08:19.434]  They were both loaded with asbestos.
[02:08:19.794 --> 02:08:24.017]  It would have cost a veritable fortune to try and clean that asbestos out of the buildings.
[02:08:24.057 --> 02:08:26.799]  What better way to get the job done and save money?
[02:08:26.839 --> 02:08:37.026]  And then there's the story of, I believe his name was Silverstein, who took over the buildings and insured them for a few million dollars and collected billions of dollars after the demise.
[02:08:37.546 --> 02:08:42.790]  There's a story of a reporter from the BBC, get this, standing in front of Building 7.
[02:08:43.971 --> 02:08:49.845]  Live, on the air, reporting to the people in Great Britain that Building 7 had already collapsed.
[02:08:50.286 --> 02:08:50.687]  It did?
[02:08:50.747 --> 02:08:52.771]  Well, what in the hell was that standing behind her?
[02:08:54.694 --> 02:08:55.435]  It's incredible.
[02:08:55.475 --> 02:09:01.539]  We're talking to KLAVAM 1230 talk show host in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[02:09:01.559 --> 02:09:04.000]  He's been on since 1991.
[02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:04.601]  16 years there.
[02:09:04.621 --> 02:09:07.723]  I remember him interviewing me 13 years ago.
[02:09:07.743 --> 02:09:13.267]  Again, he was out there on radio on a big station when literally nobody else was.
[02:09:14.087 --> 02:09:16.949]  Lew Epton pioneering fighting the New World Order.
[02:09:16.989 --> 02:09:18.150]  We are so honored
[02:09:19.222 --> 02:09:25.367]  So honored to have him on air with us today right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:09:25.707 --> 02:09:38.577]  Lou, how about we play this couple minute clip of USA newspaper television that day interviewing a terrorism expert about truck bombs in the buildings.
[02:09:39.210 --> 02:09:41.112]  Before we do, let me just add something.
[02:09:41.212 --> 02:09:43.695]  It is my honor to be on the air with you.
[02:09:44.015 --> 02:09:58.111]  You're a young man, like I've never known before in my life, who is standing up for the truth, exposing the fraud of what's going on, and it's an honest pleasure just to be able to share the airwaves with you wherever the world were being heard.
[02:09:58.451 --> 02:10:01.092]  Well, Lou, you're a sweetheart, but I'm not as young as I used to be.
[02:10:01.792 --> 02:10:08.435]  I've definitely put a lot of miles on the odometer, but again, I'm just glad folks like you were out there before I was fighting the globalists.
[02:10:08.515 --> 02:10:12.076]  And again, you've done so much for this country, my friend, so God bless you as well.
[02:10:12.356 --> 02:10:15.057]  Here is that first clip, and the next one is of Dan Rather.
[02:10:15.097 --> 02:10:15.417]  Here it is.
[02:10:15.871 --> 02:10:18.014]  Joining me is Jack Kelly.
[02:10:18.134 --> 02:10:23.280]  Now, he is a foreign correspondent, war correspondent, and just came back from Israel.
[02:10:23.461 --> 02:10:25.844]  He has some information about these attacks.
[02:10:25.964 --> 02:10:28.407]  Jack, what can you tell us happened first in New York?
[02:10:29.481 --> 02:10:42.907]  Apparently what appears to happen was that at the same time two planes hit the building that the FBI most likely thinks that there was a car or truck packed with explosives underneath the buildings which also exploded at the same time and brought both of them down.
[02:10:43.227 --> 02:10:44.848]  Now that's the first time we're hearing that.
[02:10:44.908 --> 02:10:49.430]  So two planes and explosives that were in the building, is that correct?
[02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:51.411]  That is the working theory at this point.
[02:10:51.451 --> 02:10:55.013]  That is still unconfirmed but that is what the FBI is going on at this point.
[02:10:55.433 --> 02:10:58.856]  Now, here in Washington, can you tell us what happened with this jet?
[02:10:58.956 --> 02:11:04.099]  We believe it's an American Airlines jet that was going from Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles.
[02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:05.420]  Can you tell us about that?
[02:11:06.121 --> 02:11:10.784]  At approximately 9.45, the plane hit the side of the building over there.
[02:11:11.225 --> 02:11:14.067]  There are confirmed deaths at this point.
[02:11:14.767 --> 02:11:17.649]  This is thought to be part of a coordinated attack.
[02:11:17.709 --> 02:11:19.591]  This is the first time that U.S.
[02:11:19.611 --> 02:11:24.214]  officials will actually say that this is part of a coordinated attack, and I don't think it's exactly over yet.
[02:11:24.554 --> 02:11:26.155]  Is this... it is not over yet?
[02:11:26.175 --> 02:11:28.096]  I don't believe it's actually over yet.
[02:11:28.136 --> 02:11:29.237]  They're taking precautions.
[02:11:29.337 --> 02:11:42.764]  Within the last couple of minutes, the White House has approved sending two aircraft carrier battle groups, one into the Chesapeake Bay, the other outside of the New York City area, to prepare and defend for possible future attacks.
[02:11:43.224 --> 02:11:48.827]  Now, Jack, as these battleships are headed out, does this mean war?
[02:11:49.873 --> 02:11:56.020]  Lawrence Eagleburger, the former Secretary of State, just told us that this is a declaration of war as far as he is concerned.
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:59.343]  He said this is the biggest attack against the U.S.
[02:11:59.403 --> 02:12:01.425]  since Pearl Harbor more than 60 years ago.
[02:12:01.566 --> 02:12:08.233]  So why didn't we attack Saudi Arabia where 14 of the 19 hijackers came from?
[02:12:08.253 --> 02:12:11.296]  Even if you believe the official story, why are we going to Iraq?
[02:12:11.934 --> 02:12:19.796]  Just like we're about to go into Iran, and Lou, they think the public's so dumb, they keep saying Iran, love them or hate them, is an Al-Qaeda country, and aids Al-Qaeda.
[02:12:20.736 --> 02:12:27.757]  Iran is run by Shiites, the opposite group of Al-Qaeda, the Wahhabis, and they hate them, and they hate Saudi Arabia.
[02:12:27.817 --> 02:12:29.218]  How dumb do they think the public is?
[02:12:29.458 --> 02:12:33.359]  Well, obviously they think they're as stupid as a box of rocks, and you know what?
[02:12:34.039 --> 02:12:38.620]  On occasion, I gotta think, you know, I hate to say this, but we've been so dumbed down
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:40.000]  We're good to go.
[02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:10.340]  I think?
[02:13:25.215 --> 02:13:29.180]  I'm sorry, you'll never convince me that that was hit by a 737.
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:33.825]  Quite the opposite, I think it was hit, in my personal opinion, a missile.
[02:13:34.285 --> 02:13:39.591]  Well, certainly, they won't release the good videos they've got, so they definitely want that to be a deepening debate.
[02:13:39.631 --> 02:13:40.992]  It is very suspicious, that 16-foot.
[02:13:42.453 --> 02:13:48.695]  But Lou, what about the admissions by Colonel Butler, the head of the Defense Language School, that they trained three of the hijackers there in spy training?
[02:13:49.036 --> 02:13:54.557]  What about the two embassy heads, Springman and the other one, I've interviewed both of them, saying that they were told the hijackers were U.S.
[02:13:54.597 --> 02:14:01.740]  government agents and that their terrorism designation was a cover and that they were supposed to let them back into the country by the State Department and the CIA?
[02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:06.681]  Or MSNBC and Newsweek reporting that the hijackers were trained at the Pensacola Naval Air Station?
[02:14:06.962 --> 02:14:08.082]  That has all been proven!
[02:14:08.482 --> 02:14:20.669]  I mean, the fact that they were trained at bases, and we're supposed to not talk about that, or that the official stories are fraud, or that Bush said he never heard of a plan to fly planes into buildings, and it turned out the British, the U.S., everybody done drills of it.
[02:14:21.089 --> 02:14:22.950]  In fact, John, did you grab that clip today?
[02:14:22.990 --> 02:14:23.810]  I forgot to ask you.
[02:14:23.830 --> 02:14:25.211]  John's running a show up in Minnesota.
[02:14:25.491 --> 02:14:26.111]  I'm in Texas.
[02:14:26.632 --> 02:14:27.892]  The clip with the BBC.
[02:14:27.932 --> 02:14:28.873]  We're back in the 60s.
[02:14:28.893 --> 02:14:32.555]  They ran the drill of flying a jet into the British Petroleum.
[02:14:33.395 --> 02:14:34.496]  And you have the Dan Rather clip.
[02:14:35.638 --> 02:14:36.778]  Let's play the Dan Rather clip.
[02:14:36.818 --> 02:14:47.840]  This is him, that same day, now, reporting on how they caught all these people with trucks, and explosives residue, and maps, and box cutters, and all this stuff, and then it's admitted that they were Mossad agents.
[02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:49.301]  And I'm not saying Mossad did it.
[02:14:49.321 --> 02:14:50.821]  I'm leaving that open for debate.
[02:14:51.081 --> 02:14:52.881]  The point is, why isn't this back in the news?
[02:14:52.921 --> 02:14:53.302]  Here it is.
[02:14:54.182 --> 02:15:01.563]  A very recently tonight, within the last few minutes, repeated that he believes that there are some people still alive in the rubble, in and around the World Trade Center.
[02:15:02.183 --> 02:15:05.264]  And word late tonight that two suspects are in FBI custody,
[02:15:05.814 --> 02:15:10.337]  After a truckload of explosives was discovered around the George Washington Bridge.
[02:15:10.377 --> 02:15:14.160]  That bridge links New York to New Jersey over the Hudson River.
[02:15:14.621 --> 02:15:28.030]  Whether the discovery of those explosives has anything to do with other events today is unclear, but the FBI has two suspects in hand, said the truckload of explosives, enough explosives were in the truck to do great damage to the George Washington Bridge.
[02:15:28.411 --> 02:15:31.353]  But they arrested the two suspects and they're questioning them as we speak.
[02:15:32.205 --> 02:15:35.487]  President Bush says the death toll at the Marching Center is in danger.
[02:15:36.267 --> 02:15:40.269]  Uh, Lew Efton, then they caught him in Tennessee, they caught him in Mexico City with explosives.
[02:15:40.630 --> 02:15:44.832]  This is pretty darn suspicious and then the media was ordered to shut up about it.
[02:15:45.092 --> 02:15:45.652]  How about that?
[02:15:46.152 --> 02:15:46.373]  Yeah.
[02:15:46.813 --> 02:15:50.815]  And the media takes its orders and marches right in lockstep with whatever they're told.
[02:15:51.575 --> 02:15:53.737]  Lou, what do you think the establishment is going to do, though?
[02:15:53.817 --> 02:15:56.879]  I mean, in major polls, more than half the public thinks it's an inside job.
[02:15:57.420 --> 02:16:00.021]  84% of the scientific polls believe they're being lied to about 9-11.
[02:16:00.662 --> 02:16:02.003]  What is the establishment going to do?
[02:16:02.043 --> 02:16:03.184]  They carried out these attacks.
[02:16:03.504 --> 02:16:09.608]  We don't have all exactly what happened, but we know that the official story that it was done by guys from a cave is a lie.
[02:16:09.928 --> 02:16:14.652]  What are they going to do now that we've taken their favorite tactic of staging terror and basically destroyed it?
[02:16:14.972 --> 02:16:27.619]  Well, I think they're just going to keep marching the way they are and ignore whatever the public wants to know about, and they've gotten by with it so far, there's nothing to force them to come out and admit any wrongdoing in any way, shape, or form.
[02:16:28.399 --> 02:16:33.682]  So, you know, unless... and it's not easy to get the public really aroused enough.
[02:16:33.702 --> 02:16:34.823]  You know, I'm not...
[02:16:36.352 --> 02:16:38.833]  Sitting here saying, oh, we've got to have a revolution.
[02:16:38.893 --> 02:16:39.633]  Nothing like that.
[02:16:40.033 --> 02:16:42.994]  Because in the history, I think of a planet.
[02:16:43.375 --> 02:16:47.456]  Unless people are, first of all, hungry and homeless, they're not about to do anything.
[02:16:47.916 --> 02:16:50.697]  And the majority of our citizenry still lives fairly well.
[02:16:51.137 --> 02:16:55.279]  So they're just going to go along and hope that somebody else will figure it out and expose it.
[02:16:55.739 --> 02:16:58.480]  And nothing much else is going to happen.
[02:16:59.159 --> 02:17:13.165]  But, I'd like to think, maybe, just maybe, you know I'm one of these rare people, I do believe in our Lord, I do believe He's watching what's going on, and I do know for a fact that in the end we're going to win.
[02:17:13.525 --> 02:17:17.406]  But I have this bad feeling it's going to get a lot worse before it starts getting better.
[02:17:17.426 --> 02:17:20.668]  Lou Epgen, I agree with you wholeheartedly.
[02:17:20.708 --> 02:17:23.469]  Let's get into that subject you wanted to raise, the Law of the Sea Treaty.
[02:17:24.481 --> 02:17:30.588]  The whole international takeover of our governments, the handover of the infrastructure, the ports, the roads, the power plants.
[02:17:31.128 --> 02:17:34.632]  It's all happening across the country, across the planet.
[02:17:34.652 --> 02:17:39.417]  We're talking to Lou Epton, ladies and gentlemen, from KLAV AM 1230 in Las Vegas.
[02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:51.694]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:52.054 --> 02:17:56.137]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:56.418 --> 02:17:56.978]  We listened.
[02:17:57.278 --> 02:18:02.262]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:18:02.542 --> 02:18:03.003]  We listened.
[02:18:03.403 --> 02:18:06.446]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:06.866 --> 02:18:07.407]  We listened.
[02:18:07.867 --> 02:18:11.951]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:18:12.332 --> 02:18:12.792]  We listened.
[02:18:13.132 --> 02:18:18.397]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:18:18.798 --> 02:18:19.078]  Again,
[02:18:19.638 --> 02:18:20.139]  We listened.
[02:18:20.519 --> 02:18:22.100]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:27.883]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:18:28.304 --> 02:18:30.945]  Get the Berkey Light at the American Water Purifier.
[02:18:31.125 --> 02:18:31.325]  Only $279.
[02:18:31.365 --> 02:18:32.426]  Call New Millennium.
[02:18:32.446 --> 02:18:32.526]  888-803-4438.
[02:18:32.546 --> 02:18:32.846]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:32.906 --> 02:18:34.928]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:18:34.968 --> 02:18:36.008]  Now yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:44.375 --> 02:18:46.656]  This is a market alert from Midas Resources.
[02:18:47.036 --> 02:18:57.019]  Since August 9th, the Fed has created and injected $200 billion into the financial markets to keep them afloat, ignoring the hyperinflationary hangover that is the sure result.
[02:18:57.519 --> 02:19:03.040]  Data released by the New York Federal Reserve shows that foreign central banks have cut their stash of U.S.
[02:19:03.100 --> 02:19:09.782]  Treasuries by $48 billion since late July, with falls of $32 billion in the last two weeks alone.
[02:19:10.282 --> 02:19:12.283]  Could China be quietly dumping the dollar?
[02:19:13.231 --> 02:19:20.336]  The quality of your life depends on the quality of your currency, and the quality of the dollar is poor, because the quantity is so high.
[02:19:20.757 --> 02:19:26.501]  Renting money on a thin air has disastrous results, victimizing middle class citizens and discouraging savings.
[02:19:27.061 --> 02:19:31.565]  If you have been considering precious metals as a hedge against inflation, you need to act now.
[02:19:31.985 --> 02:19:34.547]  Procrastination is the mother of lost opportunities.
[02:19:34.987 --> 02:19:37.168]  Call me, Tom Andrew at 1-800-606-1294.
[02:19:38.668 --> 02:19:42.689]  That's 1-800-606-1294.
[02:19:45.930 --> 02:19:47.610]  Are you tired of frequent urination?
[02:19:48.051 --> 02:19:50.271]  Do you drink a ton of water and still feel thirsty?
[02:19:50.591 --> 02:19:53.652]  The quantity of water you drink is not the key to hydration.
[02:19:53.832 --> 02:19:56.793]  The key to hydration is the correct clustering of water.
[02:19:56.953 --> 02:20:00.474]  When water has the ideal cluster, your cells will readily absorb it.
[02:20:00.854 --> 02:20:01.715]  We're good to go.
[02:20:26.010 --> 02:20:26.330]  I think so.
[02:20:44.409 --> 02:20:48.971]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:20:49.392 --> 02:20:52.333]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:20:52.633 --> 02:20:55.195]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:20:55.575 --> 02:21:00.397]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:21:00.778 --> 02:21:06.140]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:09.402]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[02:21:09.602 --> 02:21:10.162]  We're good to go.
[02:21:32.996 --> 02:21:33.237]  We're good.
[02:21:56.292 --> 02:21:59.374]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up with Lou Epton.
[02:21:59.394 --> 02:21:59.755]  Who knows?
[02:21:59.795 --> 02:22:02.917]  We could take some phone calls, Lou, from Las Vegas.
[02:22:02.957 --> 02:22:06.980]  You can give out the number and you can air them from your side or I can give out the number 1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:07.060 --> 02:22:08.801]  On any subject you want to discuss, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:08.841 --> 02:22:10.142]  He's out there in the grasslands.
[02:22:10.162 --> 02:22:11.704]  That's what Las Vegas translates into, I'm told.
[02:22:11.724 --> 02:22:12.344]  The grasslands of
[02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:25.870]  Skyscrapers and casinos and swimming pools.
[02:22:26.191 --> 02:22:34.152]  We're here deep in the heart of Texas in Bush-controlled, New World Order, fake conservative country as we defend the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:22:34.672 --> 02:22:43.994]  Lew, I'm glad you brought up the Law of the Sea Treaty because I don't talk enough about that and there's so many international takeovers.
[02:22:44.514 --> 02:22:47.655]  What, 74% of the world's surface is covered in
[02:22:48.693 --> 02:22:51.354]  Saltwater and another 1% is covered in freshwater.
[02:22:51.414 --> 02:22:58.918]  They claim now under this full control of the oceans and want to tax all cargo and fishing and actions that go on it.
[02:22:59.218 --> 02:23:02.920]  This would really give them a big part of the global tax they want.
[02:23:02.940 --> 02:23:09.804]  They're pushing for the other part, of course, right now through global warming, man-made global warming hysteria and fraud and all these new taxes.
[02:23:09.844 --> 02:23:12.405]  But fill folks in on the Law of the Sea treaty loop.
[02:23:13.346 --> 02:23:13.787]  Pretty much.
[02:23:13.887 --> 02:23:24.801]  I mean, I can't go into great detail because I don't know all that much more about it except that it'll put the water, which is the majority of the planet we live on, under the control of the United Nations.
[02:23:24.922 --> 02:23:28.947]  Which, by the way, from where I sit, has never been a friend of the United States.
[02:23:29.047 --> 02:23:30.229]  Not since day one.
[02:23:30.899 --> 02:23:40.665]  But if you look at the overall picture, which is globalism, and we're well on the way there right now, and this is the agenda of what's going on.
[02:23:41.006 --> 02:23:42.406]  They want the open borders.
[02:23:42.426 --> 02:23:49.451]  They want to first turn our area into what they call the North American Union, merging Canada, Mexico, with the United States.
[02:23:49.711 --> 02:23:50.792]  But that's not the end of it.
[02:23:51.232 --> 02:23:52.533]  Once they've achieved that,
[02:23:54.191 --> 02:24:03.728]  Then I'll go for step two where the end result is a one world government with a very few elite at the top and then there'll be the rest of us and we'll do exactly what we're told.
[02:24:04.577 --> 02:24:06.939]  We won't be able to buy food or anything else.
[02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:08.081]  It's really that simple.
[02:24:08.381 --> 02:24:16.929]  Between the biochips they've got and this credit card situation they've got running where, as Risa likes to say, money slows us down.
[02:24:16.949 --> 02:24:18.751]  I mean, come on!
[02:24:19.011 --> 02:24:22.455]  We're being invaded right now by how many illegals?
[02:24:22.495 --> 02:24:24.016]  Not what the government wants you to believe.
[02:24:24.336 --> 02:24:27.840]  I personally will tell you, as far as I'm concerned, we've got over 30 million
[02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:31.043]  Illegals right now running rampant across the nation.
[02:24:31.384 --> 02:24:44.798]  Now we're offering them all of our freeways and highways to the Mexican truckers whose trucks are not up to standards, whose drivers are not up to standards, which is not my idea, but which is admitted by almost everyone.
[02:24:45.099 --> 02:24:47.081]  And what will that do to the American truckers?
[02:24:47.101 --> 02:24:48.042]  Well, obviously it'll
[02:24:48.623 --> 02:24:56.238]  Call for lower wages because you can't compete with the kind of monies that they get if they're working through Mexico.
[02:24:56.599 --> 02:24:57.802]  I mean the whole thing.
[02:24:57.822 --> 02:24:59.024]  The invasion?
[02:25:00.658 --> 02:25:09.101]  This idea that, I love it, Hillary's proposing national health care again, not socialism or communism, by whatever name you want to stick with.
[02:25:09.121 --> 02:25:10.622]  Which gives them total control.
[02:25:10.642 --> 02:25:18.524]  She says you have to go to the doctor each year, they're going to decide what you're injected with, they're going to have social workers that watch you and your family, that give you visits.
[02:25:18.544 --> 02:25:23.426]  This is all about kidnapping your children, getting them into the system, this all-powerful state.
[02:25:23.786 --> 02:25:33.571]  That tracks everything you buy, tracks everywhere you go and what you do, that can turn your national ID card off for buying and selling, which they're now pushing, which can inject you with whatever they want.
[02:25:33.871 --> 02:25:42.736]  I mean, this is nightmare control, and you've got all these fools out there that think the state cares about them and loves them, when all it wants to do is get full control over you.
[02:25:42.956 --> 02:25:49.339]  By the way, Alex, you know what the whole movement, what the equality movement for women was honestly all about?
[02:25:50.099 --> 02:25:50.620]  Tell me, Len.
[02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:52.681]  To destroy the American home.
[02:25:52.701 --> 02:25:56.163]  Let them all run out and work so the state can raise your children.
[02:25:56.283 --> 02:25:56.724]  Come on!
[02:25:57.044 --> 02:26:00.366]  One of the biggest industries in the country today is called daycare centers.
[02:26:00.606 --> 02:26:02.868]  Do you really think they give a damn about your children?
[02:26:04.356 --> 02:26:05.057]  Well, we know they don't.
[02:26:05.077 --> 02:26:06.558]  We've interviewed Charlotte Isserby and others.
[02:26:06.578 --> 02:26:07.978]  High level in the Department of Education.
[02:26:07.998 --> 02:26:09.639]  It was all about breaking down the family.
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:11.821]  Of course, now she admits it.
[02:26:11.841 --> 02:26:14.242]  She's written a book about it and been questioned about it and admits it.
[02:26:14.642 --> 02:26:20.285]  Gloria Steinem was approached by the Central Intelligence Agency in the early 1960s to go start Ms.
[02:26:20.385 --> 02:26:22.066]  Magazine in the late 1960s.
[02:26:22.587 --> 02:26:26.609]  And so they could get women out of the home and get the children and then double tax.
[02:26:27.209 --> 02:26:30.111]  And then she went out and got married and had children and everything else.
[02:26:30.171 --> 02:26:31.452]  Told other women not to, though.
[02:26:32.532 --> 02:26:34.834]  Again, CIA operative, 110%.
[02:26:35.434 --> 02:26:39.437]  No question about it, unfortunately, but look what they've done to us.
[02:26:39.697 --> 02:26:42.739]  Do you know the strength of our nation when we went into World War II?
[02:26:42.779 --> 02:26:48.302]  The real strength, what made America the greatest nation as far as I'm concerned on the face of this planet?
[02:26:48.922 --> 02:26:49.663]  The family.
[02:26:50.523 --> 02:26:51.224]  Think about that.
[02:26:51.624 --> 02:26:53.945]  We had families up until World War II.
[02:26:54.326 --> 02:26:58.028]  And when the guys all ran out to enlist, I mean, it was just
[02:26:58.507 --> 02:27:02.690]  Everyone wanted to go out and help this country because it was their home, a great country.
[02:27:06.553 --> 02:27:08.594]  I don't know how to say this sometimes, Alex.
[02:27:08.654 --> 02:27:09.715]  I get very frustrated.
[02:27:09.995 --> 02:27:13.558]  But I am a believer in family and family value, okay?
[02:27:14.639 --> 02:27:17.281]  They've worked against us for so long and so hard.
[02:27:18.081 --> 02:27:21.464]  It's an uphill battle from here on out if we have any chance left at all.
[02:27:22.393 --> 02:27:23.895]  Lou Epson is our guest.
[02:27:23.935 --> 02:27:27.039]  We're simulcasting with KLAV right now.
[02:27:27.139 --> 02:27:27.679]  Stay with us.
[02:27:27.699 --> 02:27:30.062]  We'll be right back and take some of your phone calls.
[02:27:35.529 --> 02:27:36.450]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.470 --> 02:27:38.532]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.552 --> 02:27:42.176]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.609 --> 02:27:49.070]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[02:27:49.290 --> 02:27:51.411]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[02:27:51.551 --> 02:27:54.011]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[02:27:54.272 --> 02:27:58.633]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[02:27:58.673 --> 02:27:59.353]  Here's why.
[02:27:59.753 --> 02:28:05.695]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[02:28:05.935 --> 02:28:11.937]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[02:28:12.157 --> 02:28:13.077]  But they're not cheating.
[02:28:13.317 --> 02:28:17.320]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:21.863]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[02:28:21.943 --> 02:28:29.468]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[02:28:29.488 --> 02:28:30.108]  Get control.
[02:28:30.328 --> 02:28:30.909]  Get relief.
[02:28:30.969 --> 02:28:31.649]  Get some sleep.
[02:28:31.769 --> 02:28:34.972]  Go to www.outin90.com.
[02:28:35.092 --> 02:28:38.474]  That's www.outin90.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:28:38.514 --> 02:28:38.734]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:28:46.826 --> 02:28:53.592]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two books set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[02:28:53.952 --> 02:29:00.378]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[02:29:00.838 --> 02:29:10.747]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[02:29:11.227 --> 02:29:14.690]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[02:29:14.990 --> 02:29:17.672]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[02:29:18.292 --> 02:29:20.994]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.
[02:29:21.554 --> 02:29:25.677]  Send your check for $32 post-pay to Radio Liberty P.O.
[02:29:25.717 --> 02:29:27.058]  Box 969 Soquel, S-O-Q-U-E-L, California, 95073.
[02:29:27.098 --> 02:29:30.160]  $32 to Radio Liberty Box 969 Soquel, California, 95073.
[02:29:30.580 --> 02:29:31.241]  Or call 1-800-544-8927.
[02:29:31.261 --> 02:29:31.321]  1-800-544-8927.
[02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:48.142]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[02:29:48.662 --> 02:29:50.143]  After a pedicure they look great.
[02:29:50.484 --> 02:29:54.307]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[02:29:54.767 --> 02:29:56.969]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[02:29:57.389 --> 02:30:00.732]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[02:30:01.132 --> 02:30:03.594]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[02:30:04.094 --> 02:30:05.135]  What's that name again?
[02:30:05.535 --> 02:30:06.716]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[02:30:07.097 --> 02:30:08.257]  It's CalX.
[02:30:08.678 --> 02:30:10.519]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[02:30:10.859 --> 02:30:12.701]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[02:30:13.487 --> 02:30:22.095]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[02:30:22.535 --> 02:30:28.260]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[02:30:28.661 --> 02:30:39.771]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[02:30:40.416 --> 02:30:41.518]  Hey, here's a drugstore.
[02:30:41.858 --> 02:30:42.539]  I'll be right back.
[02:30:42.659 --> 02:30:44.362]  I'm getting some Callux for my heels.
[02:31:05.247 --> 02:31:08.771]  1-800-259-9231 is the number to call in here.
[02:31:23.475 --> 02:31:27.237]  Lou, why don't you fire out the phone number if folks want to call into the Vegas station?
[02:31:27.697 --> 02:31:28.617]  Well, we've got a couple here.
[02:31:28.677 --> 02:31:30.958]  Our local number, of course, is 731-1230.
[02:31:31.098 --> 02:31:36.720]  Our toll-free is 1-866-820-5528.
[02:31:37.180 --> 02:31:41.562]  Alex, if I may just mention real quickly, we have Leon online.
[02:31:42.002 --> 02:31:42.503]  Is it okay?
[02:31:42.523 --> 02:31:43.463]  Let's take that call.
[02:31:43.783 --> 02:31:44.583]  Leon, good morning.
[02:31:44.623 --> 02:31:45.724]  You're on with Alex Jones.
[02:31:46.264 --> 02:31:48.265]  Yes, good morning, Lou, and good afternoon, Alex.
[02:31:50.180 --> 02:31:51.080]  Oh, I hope he's there.
[02:31:51.520 --> 02:31:52.000]  Yes, I'm here.
[02:31:52.040 --> 02:31:52.381]  Come ahead.
[02:31:52.461 --> 02:31:52.841]  Oh, great.
[02:31:52.961 --> 02:31:58.102]  Hey, what I was wondering about, you've been able to maintain such a great sponsorship with your program for so long.
[02:31:58.422 --> 02:32:10.224]  I'm wondering how the Luetkin program can take advantage of those same ideas, and wondering how important it is for listener support in your radio program, so folks listening to the Luetkin program get that also.
[02:32:10.304 --> 02:32:11.045]  And I'll listen up here.
[02:32:11.145 --> 02:32:11.365]  Thanks.
[02:32:14.614 --> 02:32:20.124]  Let me first say, Alex, believe it or not, you've got a large following right here in Southern Nevada.
[02:32:20.405 --> 02:32:23.831]  People absolutely love you, and I totally understand it.
[02:32:24.620 --> 02:32:25.780]  Well, they're fantastic folks.
[02:32:25.820 --> 02:32:27.881]  I'm just trying to do my job and get the word out.
[02:32:28.121 --> 02:32:29.341]  But I do have quite a few sponsors.
[02:32:29.361 --> 02:32:30.281]  We have a large audience.
[02:32:30.661 --> 02:32:34.042]  We're on over 50 AM and FM stations, shore, internet, satellite, things like that.
[02:32:34.522 --> 02:32:41.804]  But I mean, really, it's just the listeners out there taking the audio files from the show, getting the word out that lets us continue our operation.
[02:32:42.024 --> 02:32:44.725]  But obviously, you're doing decent too, Lou, if you've been there since 1991.
[02:32:44.785 --> 02:32:44.965]  But yes,
[02:32:46.525 --> 02:32:50.747]  Supporting talk shows, spreading the word about the talk shows, that is so important.
[02:32:50.767 --> 02:33:04.071]  And when you've got a great AM host like Lou in your area, I know most of you already know this, but every day, don't forget, tell somebody else at a red light, tell somebody at school, tell somebody at work, hey, at lunch, tune in and listen to Lou Epton.
[02:33:04.091 --> 02:33:05.212]  That's how we spread the word.
[02:33:05.232 --> 02:33:05.952]  Tell folks about
[02:33:06.372 --> 02:33:07.974]  Okay, let me ask you something, Alex.
[02:33:07.994 --> 02:33:10.117]  How did you first begin getting involved in broadcasting?
[02:33:24.702 --> 02:33:26.684]  I think a lot of people would like to know.
[02:33:26.704 --> 02:33:34.748]  I'm so grateful you did, and I'm so grateful that you're there and you're on, because I can't think of anyone else that hits a nail on the head as well as you do.
[02:33:34.768 --> 02:33:36.970]  Oh well, there's a lot of folks better than me.
[02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.990]  I mean that, but go ahead.
[02:33:38.010 --> 02:33:39.431]  I just outpost work as much as I do.
[02:33:40.532 --> 02:33:47.336]  In 1994, about a year or so after the massacre at Waco, I got really informed about the New World Order to a certain extent.
[02:33:47.576 --> 02:33:50.258]  The Federal Reserve being private, kind of a mainline Ron Paul,
[02:33:50.658 --> 02:33:50.938]  I think so.
[02:33:50.958 --> 02:33:51.218]  I think so.
[02:34:16.754 --> 02:34:32.683]  And then by 96, early 96, I'd been on the air a while, about a year, and I got approached by folks that were about to switch a rock station to talk, and they put me on three hours Saturday night.
[02:34:32.703 --> 02:34:33.524]  It got good ratings.
[02:34:33.564 --> 02:34:34.665]  They put me on weeknights.
[02:34:35.405 --> 02:34:41.669]  And then there was a little fledgling shortwave slash satellite network called Republic Broadcasting.
[02:34:41.689 --> 02:34:43.790]  I interviewed Mark Kornke and John Stattmiller.
[02:34:44.230 --> 02:34:50.835]  And they said, you know, let us carry your feed, your weekday feed and your Saturday feed over the telephone line over this.
[02:34:50.895 --> 02:34:52.336]  And then it just exploded from there.
[02:34:52.757 --> 02:34:54.338]  And then that went belly up, I think, in like 98.
[02:34:55.799 --> 02:35:01.864]  And Ted Anderson, been their biggest sponsor, they asked him, hey, please help us stay on, start something new.
[02:35:01.924 --> 02:35:02.484]  He did that.
[02:35:02.524 --> 02:35:03.785]  And the rest is history.
[02:35:03.966 --> 02:35:04.586]  Here we are, Lou.
[02:35:04.626 --> 02:35:05.367]  But enough about me.
[02:35:05.407 --> 02:35:06.748]  That's really kind of boring.
[02:35:06.788 --> 02:35:08.269]  But I started out on AXS TV.
[02:35:09.970 --> 02:35:22.356]  Now I was just curious because it's such a, to me, it's a great feeling to know that you're there, you're out there, and you're getting the word out in large fashion, and I only wish there were a couple hundred more like you.
[02:35:22.697 --> 02:35:27.199]  Unfortunately, I can't think of anybody else that comes anywhere near what you're doing.
[02:35:27.239 --> 02:35:29.920]  We have another caller online right now, if it's okay, though, Alex.
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:30.641]  Yeah, let's go, Joe.
[02:35:30.821 --> 02:35:31.901]  Okay, Stephen, good morning.
[02:35:31.921 --> 02:35:33.102]  You're on with Alex Jones.
[02:35:33.863 --> 02:35:38.487]  Yes, good morning Alex and Lew, my two favorite talk show hosts.
[02:35:39.548 --> 02:35:42.931]  I'm really proud of you guys getting together and attempting this.
[02:35:43.791 --> 02:35:55.301]  Alex and Lew, Lew doesn't know it yet, I've been started producing, or not really producing, putting together kind of a synopsis of your three hours and sending it out.
[02:35:55.321 --> 02:36:00.045]  I've got about 50 or 60 people that I email it to and ask them to forward it.
[02:36:00.831 --> 02:36:09.788]  I try not to do too much editorializing, but just try to identify what could be the really good points for them to consider listening.
[02:36:11.958 --> 02:36:15.460]  If I can get them to listen to it an hour, they're probably going to be hooked.
[02:36:15.580 --> 02:36:18.482]  That's what happened to me about six or seven months ago.
[02:36:18.522 --> 02:36:21.084]  A friend said, do you ever listen to Alex Jones?
[02:36:21.124 --> 02:36:25.686]  You can listen to it on my computer and I've been hooked ever since.
[02:36:26.027 --> 02:36:26.967]  Well that's how it works.
[02:36:27.307 --> 02:36:31.190]  We also have the podcast that people can download for free.
[02:36:32.183 --> 02:36:35.467]  We just want to get the word out, my friend.
[02:36:35.488 --> 02:36:37.150]  Thank you for what you're doing.
[02:36:48.283 --> 02:36:50.965]  That's where it's at, and I appreciate both your efforts.
[02:36:51.265 --> 02:36:51.865]  Thank you, Stephen.
[02:36:52.005 --> 02:36:53.606]  You're both to be rewarded, I'm sure.
[02:36:53.667 --> 02:36:54.007]  Take care.
[02:36:54.047 --> 02:36:58.570]  By the way, Alex, did you cover the Aaron Russo film?
[02:36:58.670 --> 02:37:00.051]  It was absolutely magnificent.
[02:37:00.071 --> 02:37:01.251]  You know, I'm glad you raised that.
[02:37:01.291 --> 02:37:09.257]  I knew that you were friends with Aaron, and his passing is really a sad thing, but what a legacy he left.
[02:37:09.277 --> 02:37:11.198]  I mean, what a life worth leading.
[02:37:11.278 --> 02:37:15.341]  I mean, somebody at the end of his life, people say, God bless him, instead of, who cares?
[02:37:15.681 --> 02:37:15.901]  Yeah.
[02:37:16.381 --> 02:37:16.841]  Absolutely.
[02:37:16.861 --> 02:37:21.483]  Speaking of films, you can go to whatistheendgame.com or endgamethemovie.com or go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com
[02:37:43.470 --> 02:37:46.493]  There's big links to watch the three movie trailers.
[02:37:46.873 --> 02:37:51.257]  We're going to have the official, you know, really fancy trailer we did coming out at the end of this week.
[02:37:51.598 --> 02:37:52.639]  We've got three trailers.
[02:37:52.679 --> 02:37:53.940]  One of them is the intro to the film.
[02:37:54.260 --> 02:37:58.044]  The other two are little minute-long synopses of different sections of the film.
[02:37:58.404 --> 02:38:02.868]  And Endgame gets into the global master plan to exterminate 80% of the population.
[02:38:03.088 --> 02:38:03.909]  We all know that.
[02:38:03.929 --> 02:38:08.994]  We have the Autobahn Society quotes and the World Wildlife Fund quotes and Prince Philip and Ted Turner.
[02:38:09.554 --> 02:38:09.874]  I don't know.
[02:38:29.039 --> 02:38:30.620]  Alex, it's an honor to speak with you.
[02:38:54.304 --> 02:39:10.116]  I was thinking about that show, that review show that was supposed to have the Loose Change crew, and I was thinking that the only way, the reason why it was preempted was that the people in the media know that 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:39:10.196 --> 02:39:16.921]  If 9-11 was not an inside job, they would have let the people from the Loose Change crew on that episode say what they want.
[02:39:17.282 --> 02:39:17.502]  Yeah.
[02:39:17.984 --> 02:39:23.889]  Well, again, Rosie tried to get him on, tried to get William Rodriguez on, and she was told no.
[02:39:23.929 --> 02:39:27.111]  She was offered more money not to leave, but told we'll have editorial control.
[02:39:27.832 --> 02:39:40.121]  And again, I disagree with a lot of things Rosie believes in, but I admire her passion and her courage to turn down a multi-million dollar a year contract and leave because she wasn't allowed to say or do what she wanted.
[02:39:41.202 --> 02:39:41.362]  Right.
[02:39:42.831 --> 02:39:47.314]  Imagine if the whole Loose Change crew were to get this copy of the endgame.
[02:39:47.354 --> 02:40:01.284]  Not just the Loose Change crew, but the We Are Change movement and all chapters of the We Are Change movement were to have their own personal copy of Terror Storm Special Edition and this endgame coming out.
[02:40:01.364 --> 02:40:02.565]  Have both filmed.
[02:40:03.812 --> 02:40:12.657]  Well, supposedly in a few months you will probably, I mean they're tweaking it right now, it's a great film, the final cut of Loose Change, so we'll see how that develops.
[02:40:12.717 --> 02:40:13.797]  Richard, thank you so much.
[02:40:13.877 --> 02:40:14.878]  Dave in Connecticut.
[02:40:15.198 --> 02:40:16.379]  Dave, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:40:17.539 --> 02:40:20.241]  Hi Alex, big fan of your show.
[02:40:20.661 --> 02:40:28.065]  I was wondering, Bradley Butler once said that banks loan countries money, and when they don't pay they get invaded.
[02:40:28.825 --> 02:40:30.886]  Yes, he said war is a racket.
[02:40:30.926 --> 02:40:31.827]  Yes, he wrote a book about it.
[02:40:32.901 --> 02:40:33.481]  So is the U.S.
[02:40:33.542 --> 02:40:36.184]  being set up to be invaded since we have such a huge debt?
[02:40:36.644 --> 02:40:43.489]  Well, that was called gunboat diplomacy, and that went on from, say, 1850 through the 1930s.
[02:40:44.210 --> 02:40:54.498]  And what would happen is they would land the Marines in total, I think, what, eight, nine different countries over those 60, 70, 80 years, and they would give a loan to a dictator knowing he wouldn't pay it back.
[02:40:55.038 --> 02:40:55.499]  I think so, yes.
[02:41:13.534 --> 02:41:20.499]  And they go in and then get the infrastructure, the water, literally the people are signed over as collateral, and then they get control.
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:31.548]  And so on a billion dollar debt, a nation will end up paying, like Nigeria, 60-something billion in interest on that, loans made in the 70s, and then they get just full ownership of the country.
[02:41:31.768 --> 02:41:36.091]  And then that's fiat currency issued out of nothing, backing up the IMF and World Bank.
[02:41:36.111 --> 02:41:37.552]  So the bankers just create it out of nothing.
[02:41:38.613 --> 02:41:40.113]  Yeah, no, no argument.
[02:41:40.154 --> 02:41:45.935]  You know, you talk about the film put out by Loose Change, which is really, I've got a copy, it's outstanding.
[02:41:46.275 --> 02:41:54.518]  But I was going to ask you, Alex, are you also familiar with Dave Monclay's, and his 9-11 in plain sight, and his newest 9-11 ripple effect?
[02:41:54.858 --> 02:42:03.000]  He's got a lot of important people on that, and they're all verifying what we've been talking about, that this whole situation of 9-11 was a setup job.
[02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:04.641]  Sure, I'm aware of those films.
[02:42:04.681 --> 02:42:06.243]  Dave's a nice fellow here on the network.
[02:42:06.943 --> 02:42:08.365]  Lou, let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:42:08.405 --> 02:42:09.085]  Thank you, Dave.
[02:42:09.425 --> 02:42:10.546]  Joe in Missouri.
[02:42:10.566 --> 02:42:11.167]  You're on the air.
[02:42:11.207 --> 02:42:11.627]  Go ahead.
[02:42:11.647 --> 02:42:14.270]  Hello, gentlemen.
[02:42:14.370 --> 02:42:16.632]  It's a pleasure to speak with you both.
[02:42:17.232 --> 02:42:20.795]  Alex, I have some information for you.
[02:42:21.236 --> 02:42:24.999]  Here in a talk show that goes on in the morning in Kansas City,
[02:42:25.972 --> 02:42:28.774]  Uh, called Tell Somebody on 90.185.
[02:42:29.914 --> 02:42:39.059]  They were interviewing, uh, the mayor, Mark Funkhouser, mayor of Kansas City, Mark Funkhouser, and they were speaking about the, uh, Napa Superhighway.
[02:42:39.079 --> 02:42:40.299]  Oh boy.
[02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:41.040]  Yeah.
[02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:41.920]  Yeah.
[02:42:42.220 --> 02:42:55.107]  They, the host questioned him about it, and of course, the mayor denied knowing anything about the highway, but he did admit that they do have plans to use the railroad, uh, from Mexico
[02:42:55.802 --> 02:42:57.546]  To bring all the goods in from Mexico.
[02:42:57.927 --> 02:43:03.341]  Mexico already took over the former second largest train station in the country.
[02:43:04.250 --> 02:43:05.151]  Right there in St.
[02:43:05.191 --> 02:43:19.058]  Louis, that's official news, in the official TxDOT and Federal Transportation Department documents, they call it the NAFTA Super North American Highway, North American Integration, and now when they get heat, they just deny it exists.
[02:43:19.338 --> 02:43:25.722]  I mean, this is the incredible, but again, the massive lie, then we spend all day debating and talking about how they're liars.
[02:43:26.790 --> 02:43:31.755]  Listen, a month ago, an international tribunal ordered the U.S.
[02:43:31.775 --> 02:43:34.497]  to open up to Mexican trucks, and it started happening.
[02:43:35.218 --> 02:43:40.003]  International tribunals, every couple days, have more power than Congress because they signed it away.
[02:43:40.563 --> 02:43:45.708]  I mean, we're under United Nations regulations on our national parks.
[02:43:45.908 --> 02:43:50.493]  They're talking about international regulations on over a 3,000 square foot house, you'll pay taxes.
[02:43:50.553 --> 02:43:51.774]  It's already in place in England.
[02:43:52.394 --> 02:43:54.435]  I mean, they're just doing it right now.
[02:43:54.495 --> 02:43:59.217]  They're talking about, we always said they were going to come out with a new gas tax, and fuel tax, and energy tax.
[02:43:59.517 --> 02:44:00.537]  Now they're announcing it.
[02:44:01.698 --> 02:44:06.479]  They keep saying, do something about global warming, and I tell people it's a tax, and they would deny it was a tax a year ago.
[02:44:06.759 --> 02:44:09.440]  Now they're announcing it's a tax, but then saying there is no tax.
[02:44:09.680 --> 02:44:11.501]  They say it is a tax, but it doesn't exist.
[02:44:11.801 --> 02:44:16.523]  I mean, that is a psychological warfare tactic just to take you back, and they know that
[02:44:17.663 --> 02:44:23.306]  60% of the public doesn't read or check anything out, so they just hear that and want to rationalize and procrastinate and say it isn't true.
[02:44:23.646 --> 02:44:26.827]  I mean, Lew, what do you think of just the unbelievable lying that's going on now?
[02:44:27.128 --> 02:44:28.168]  Well, it's not new.
[02:44:28.468 --> 02:44:29.989]  It's been going on for decades.
[02:44:30.749 --> 02:44:33.611]  I wish more people were more aware of it, obviously.
[02:44:34.091 --> 02:44:37.532]  But, you know, we talk about the NAFTA highway.
[02:44:37.572 --> 02:44:39.193]  Let's call it what it really is.
[02:44:39.233 --> 02:44:43.355]  You see, highways and freeways are under state control.
[02:44:44.093 --> 02:44:46.215]  This is going to be a corridor.
[02:44:46.675 --> 02:44:47.455]  Is there a difference?
[02:44:47.475 --> 02:44:48.236]  You better believe it.
[02:44:48.596 --> 02:44:51.638]  Corridors are under federal control.
[02:44:51.678 --> 02:44:58.303]  And this one is under international auspices, so it's key arteries of control and taxation to control movement.
[02:44:58.583 --> 02:45:01.165]  How did Rome control Germania, Gaul?
[02:45:01.585 --> 02:45:03.187]  How did it control Judea?
[02:45:03.487 --> 02:45:05.028]  How did it control Greece?
[02:45:05.048 --> 02:45:07.710]  How did it control North Africa, Egypt?
[02:45:07.730 --> 02:45:09.291]  How did it control its holdings?
[02:45:10.257 --> 02:45:22.401]  It owned the roads and used them as tax and control and checkpoints to regulate, and they admit that they're going to use the money from this to fund North American integration infrastructure.
[02:45:22.681 --> 02:45:29.703]  So right there, the money for this goes to build up their infrastructure, not the old infrastructure of the states and the federal level.
[02:45:29.763 --> 02:45:33.385]  I mean, it's global government taxation in our face.
[02:45:33.665 --> 02:45:37.786]  They're building it right here in Austin, and you can't even... I mean, it's unbelievable, Lou.
[02:45:38.286 --> 02:45:38.907]  No, I know it.
[02:45:39.707 --> 02:45:58.840]  I'll tell you, I look at my kids, I look at my grandkids, and I'm really... There are times I wish I'd have stayed single all of my life, because the life they're going to lead, the life young folks are going to lead, I feel like I've been very lucky having been born when I was, and I just hate the thought of the kind of world they're growing up in.
[02:45:58.940 --> 02:46:01.482]  Well, good people are getting involved thanks to people like you, Lou.
[02:46:01.742 --> 02:46:03.243]  Let's talk to Mark in Canada.
[02:46:03.263 --> 02:46:04.024]  Mark, you're on the air.
[02:46:04.064 --> 02:46:04.444]  Go ahead.
[02:46:06.041 --> 02:46:06.801]  Hi, how are you doing?
[02:46:06.961 --> 02:46:07.321]  Not sure.
[02:46:07.702 --> 02:46:08.162]  Good.
[02:46:08.282 --> 02:46:09.082]  Hello to Lou, too.
[02:46:09.122 --> 02:46:11.603]  I've never heard of you before, but I'm happy I'm hearing enough.
[02:46:12.163 --> 02:46:13.083]  I've got two comments.
[02:46:13.444 --> 02:46:19.245]  The first is, you know the art of war, the expression, you can't start a revolution on an empty stomach?
[02:46:19.526 --> 02:46:19.846]  Yeah.
[02:46:20.366 --> 02:46:24.187]  I think we're at the point now where we're at the Thanksgiving dinner and we haven't left yet.
[02:46:24.807 --> 02:46:28.709]  We're that dumbed down by just the entertainment, the distractions, everything else.
[02:46:29.009 --> 02:46:29.609]  Yeah.
[02:46:29.789 --> 02:46:35.711]  And to all the police brutality that's coming out and the tasering and everything else,
[02:46:36.526 --> 02:46:43.412]  I think the only protection we have now is to carry a camera, whether it be a cell phone camera, a little hand cam, anything.
[02:46:43.833 --> 02:46:49.798]  And if you're just going to stand there and do nothing anyways, at least have the courtesy to record it and get it to somebody who will.
[02:46:49.998 --> 02:46:53.782]  And that could be, you know, your buddy's kid if you can't figure out how to work it.
[02:46:54.382 --> 02:47:00.608]  But just get everything out because the only thing that's protecting these people from like the Montebello provocateurs
[02:47:01.058 --> 02:47:01.978]  They're getting tasering.
[02:47:02.298 --> 02:47:05.700]  The only thing that's protecting them is it being recorded and put out on YouTube.
[02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:11.182]  And by the way, it's now admitted the cops were hitting people trying to stage a riot so they could attack peaceful protesters.
[02:47:11.462 --> 02:47:12.722]  That's now mainstream news.
[02:47:13.022 --> 02:47:13.222]  Yeah.
[02:47:13.783 --> 02:47:16.143]  A major victory against government-sponsored terror.
[02:47:16.624 --> 02:47:17.424]  That's what that is.
[02:47:17.444 --> 02:47:19.185]  They're having a North American Union Summit.
[02:47:19.605 --> 02:47:20.825]  They don't want people protesting.
[02:47:20.845 --> 02:47:22.346]  They see no protesting in the city.
[02:47:22.606 --> 02:47:23.846]  People show up anyways.
[02:47:24.246 --> 02:47:25.787]  And they're more sophisticated than Burma.
[02:47:26.508 --> 02:47:33.411]  Instead of just coming out and shooting everybody, they have their guys dressed up, starting fights so they can then shoot rubber bullets at everybody.
[02:47:33.631 --> 02:47:36.933]  That is a training aid and a prelude to real bullets being used.
[02:47:36.993 --> 02:47:37.533]  Will you have them?
[02:47:37.913 --> 02:47:38.554]  Absolutely.
[02:47:38.954 --> 02:47:40.074]  You know, you stop and think about it.
[02:47:40.875 --> 02:47:44.696]  People keep hollering about the war that's going on right now over in Iraq.
[02:47:44.756 --> 02:47:50.059]  Do you know how many American service people are left here in our country?
[02:47:50.808 --> 02:47:52.350]  Protecting our shores.
[02:47:52.430 --> 02:48:01.580]  Did you know that they have well over 200,000 plus foreigners who were illegal aliens, many of them aggravated felons, now in our military?
[02:48:01.841 --> 02:48:02.061]  Yeah.
[02:48:03.146 --> 02:48:05.366]  Think about that, because it's really important.
[02:48:05.467 --> 02:48:08.447]  Right now, we do have a call online from our area, if it's okay, Alex.
[02:48:08.487 --> 02:48:08.927]  Let's take it.
[02:48:09.267 --> 02:48:11.288]  Mark, that would be you, and we say good morning.
[02:48:11.308 --> 02:48:13.068]  You're on with Alex Jones, and yours truly.
[02:48:13.288 --> 02:48:14.868]  Hey, gents, how are you guys doing?
[02:48:14.948 --> 02:48:17.229]  Hey, hey, hey, I'll tell you what, Lou, we've got a break for the final break.
[02:48:17.269 --> 02:48:18.269]  Let's come back to him, okay?
[02:48:18.329 --> 02:48:18.649]  Okay.
[02:48:18.669 --> 02:48:20.290]  Hey, you're going to be back in three quick minutes.
[02:48:20.310 --> 02:48:23.330]  We'll go right to Lou's caller, and then I've got to wrap it up with Lou Epton.
[02:48:23.350 --> 02:48:26.751]  We need to do this more often, not just once a year, Lou.
[02:48:26.791 --> 02:48:27.911]  Okay, you've got a deal, Alex.
[02:48:27.931 --> 02:48:28.771]  All right, we'll be right back.
[02:48:29.031 --> 02:48:29.912]  All right, we'll be right back.
[02:48:29.932 --> 02:48:31.032]  Stay with us, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:48.687 --> 02:48:54.153]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.514 --> 02:49:02.142]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.836 --> 02:49:09.899]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.299 --> 02:49:21.704]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.024 --> 02:49:25.666]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.006 --> 02:49:28.207]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.267 --> 02:49:32.029]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:47.074 --> 02:49:48.114]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:49:48.434 --> 02:49:51.215]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:51.475 --> 02:49:55.657]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:56.057 --> 02:49:56.897]  So what do you do?
[02:49:57.217 --> 02:50:01.759]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:50:02.259 --> 02:50:04.401]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:50:04.881 --> 02:50:05.762]  Sheltering in Place!

[02:50:45.436 --> 02:50:49.718]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:50:49.958 --> 02:50:54.839]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:50:55.059 --> 02:50:56.400]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:56.560 --> 02:50:59.921]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:51:45.285 --> 02:51:48.488]  Well, I really appreciate Lew Upton coming on with us.
[02:51:48.568 --> 02:51:51.310]  I'm into the final segment here.
[02:51:51.810 --> 02:51:57.155]  Before we take that final call, Lew, I just wanted to add that
[02:52:13.542 --> 02:52:18.206]  If you go to PrisonPlanet.com, it says, FBI thought bombs brought down towers on 9-11.
[02:52:18.686 --> 02:52:24.370]  In the DIG comments there on the DIG message board, they're saying, oh, we thought it was thermite.
[02:52:24.390 --> 02:52:25.891]  We thought it was bombs in the buildings.
[02:52:26.232 --> 02:52:27.793]  You're saying, no, it was truck bombs.
[02:52:28.013 --> 02:52:28.373]  No!
[02:52:29.054 --> 02:52:33.337]  We're showing that the FBI, the way the buildings blew up, thought there were bombs, too.
[02:52:33.677 --> 02:52:35.579]  Because it looked like controlled demolitions.
[02:52:36.218 --> 02:52:40.600]  And then they arrested people with explosives in trucks and were ordered to let them go.
[02:52:40.620 --> 02:52:42.101]  That's what we said.
[02:52:42.121 --> 02:52:45.123]  We need to add that so people can't spin what we're saying.
[02:52:45.463 --> 02:52:47.444]  We're showing the official story as a fraud.
[02:52:47.905 --> 02:52:49.325]  Lou, you want to go to that crawler?
[02:52:49.585 --> 02:52:50.606]  Okay, we've got him.
[02:52:50.826 --> 02:52:52.507]  Mark, you're on, and let's go for it.
[02:52:52.767 --> 02:52:55.008]  Hey, it's good to hear you guys together.
[02:52:55.149 --> 02:52:57.250]  I live here in Las Vegas, long-time listener of
[02:52:58.109 --> 02:52:59.030]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:52:59.671 --> 02:53:01.273]  I just wanted to bring you guys to the attention.
[02:53:01.353 --> 02:53:02.875]  Alex, you might be interested in this.
[02:53:03.295 --> 02:53:08.080]  There's a book that came out recently, I don't know if you're familiar with it, called Falling Off the Thin Blue Line.
[02:53:09.060 --> 02:53:13.482]  And it's about the steroid problem in law enforcement.
[02:53:13.883 --> 02:53:15.844]  Yeah, they've done federal studies.
[02:53:15.924 --> 02:53:19.165]  It's the highest level group of any profession on steroids.
[02:53:19.426 --> 02:53:27.970]  Yes, and these people, they go on steroids and give them a roid rage and it's like, no wonder they're going crazy, Alex.
[02:53:27.990 --> 02:53:32.072]  So I thought that might be of interest to you.
[02:53:32.092 --> 02:53:35.394]  It sounds like it might be a pretty interesting guest to have on sometime, Alex.
[02:53:36.184 --> 02:53:37.905]  No, there definitely a lot of them are on ROID.
[02:53:37.925 --> 02:53:38.486]  You can see it.
[02:53:38.506 --> 02:53:48.754]  They got the water buffalo hump on their back, fatty muscle, and long-term guys that really screws up your endocrine system and your male organs, and you don't need that to be tough.
[02:53:49.414 --> 02:53:51.516]  And not only that, they shouldn't even be doing that.
[02:53:51.536 --> 02:53:54.278]  If there's somebody who they need to take down... It's a Schedule III.
[02:53:54.298 --> 02:53:55.379]  It's the same as cocaine.
[02:53:55.399 --> 02:54:00.723]  I mean, they should call backup if there's somebody who's bigger than them they need to take down.
[02:54:00.743 --> 02:54:02.765]  There's really no reason.
[02:54:02.905 --> 02:54:04.867]  It's all about trying to intimidate us, Alex.
[02:54:05.587 --> 02:54:09.550]  Yeah, they look at us as the enemy, I guess, Alex.
[02:54:09.951 --> 02:54:11.032]  No question about that.
[02:54:11.152 --> 02:54:12.313]  Well, I think we're out of time.
[02:54:12.373 --> 02:54:22.681]  Lew Epton, I want to really thank you for having me on your show, and I want to thank KLAV AM 1230 for having you on for the last 16 plus years.
[02:54:22.921 --> 02:54:28.826]  And I would invite them, I know they can't pick up my weekday show, it's all the same time as you, they ought to pick up the Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:54:28.866 --> 02:54:29.287]  Central,
[02:54:30.387 --> 02:54:36.989]  And I guess that would be 2 to 4 Pacific, and then it's also retransmitted over and over again by the Genesis Network.
[02:54:37.409 --> 02:54:41.170]  So I would love to have KLAV pick up the Sunday show.
[02:54:41.190 --> 02:54:42.090]  They've got an opening, Luke.
[02:54:42.430 --> 02:54:43.331]  Well, I'll find out.
[02:54:43.351 --> 02:54:48.572]  And by golly, if it's a possibility, it'll be doable, and you'll hear from us.
[02:54:48.712 --> 02:54:50.814]  Well, I come in every Sunday.
[02:54:51.335 --> 02:54:53.037]  I've been doing it for about 8 months.
[02:54:53.057 --> 02:54:54.439]  We've got about 14 affiliates.
[02:54:54.499 --> 02:54:55.239]  It's growing.
[02:54:55.700 --> 02:54:56.681]  And Lou, who knows?
[02:54:56.741 --> 02:55:08.935]  Maybe we should get you to talk to the network and see about getting a rebroadcast of your KLV or something on KLAV here on the GCN Radio Network because you are just so fabulous, my friend.
[02:55:08.975 --> 02:55:09.476]  God bless you.
[02:55:09.756 --> 02:55:10.756]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:55:10.817 --> 02:55:11.357]  God bless you.
[02:55:11.377 --> 02:55:21.141]  And by the way, you have more outstanding videos that I hope people are taking advantage of because it explores and explains reality of what's been going on, okay?
[02:55:21.161 --> 02:55:21.821]  Thank you.
[02:55:21.941 --> 02:55:30.045]  Thank you for having me on your show this morning and for your being on my show this morning or this afternoon, wherever people might be.
[02:55:30.925 --> 02:55:33.747]  If I might mention my website, it's a very difficult one.
[02:55:33.807 --> 02:55:36.568]  It's simply theleweptonshow.com.
[02:55:36.628 --> 02:55:37.869]  There's some information on there.
[02:55:37.909 --> 02:55:40.190]  A real tribute to the late Aaron Russo.
[02:55:40.251 --> 02:55:40.551]  You bet.
[02:55:40.571 --> 02:55:42.732]  We've got a link to it up on infowars.com.
[02:55:42.792 --> 02:55:43.272]  Thank you, Luke.
[02:55:43.492 --> 02:55:44.033]  God bless you.
[02:55:44.053 --> 02:55:45.394]  Thank you so much, Alex Jones.
[02:55:45.414 --> 02:55:45.694]  You bet.
