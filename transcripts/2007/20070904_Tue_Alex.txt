[00:00:05.853 --> 00:00:06.494]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.154 --> 00:00:08.214]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.935 --> 00:00:10.035]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:11.496]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:13.176]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.817 --> 00:00:17.638]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:22.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:28.182]  Well, we have a very important Tuesday edition lined up for you.
[00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:30.283]  Feels like a Monday with a holiday yesterday.
[00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:34.043]  Already the fourth day of September 2007.
[00:00:34.083 --> 00:00:39.908]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:39.948 --> 00:00:42.610]  Another very important broadcast lined up for you.
[00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:51.377]  Mike Rivero joins us once a month and I can't think of a better time for him to be joining us with all of this serious Iran war news in front of us.
[00:00:51.437 --> 00:00:57.582]  So many people think that they're not going to attack Iran because the American people are 70 plus percent against it in major polls.
[00:00:59.003 --> 00:00:59.804]  You don't understand.
[00:00:59.844 --> 00:01:01.145]  The globalists don't care.
[00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:06.899]  And it does appear, in fact the evidence shows, that they are prepared to go into Iran.
[00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.701]  We'll be discussing that in great detail in the second hour.
[00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:14.104]  Then for about 20 minutes, I've got Deborah Jean Palfrey joining us.
[00:01:14.164 --> 00:01:15.865]  We first interviewed her a few months ago.
[00:01:16.346 --> 00:01:20.789]  Since then, she's gone more public on who her clientele list was, the DC Madam.
[00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:22.730]  So she'll be joining us for about 20-30 minutes.
[00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.434]  And then, of course, Luke Rudowsky in the last 20 minutes of the transmission or so, because I want to
[00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:32.524]  Tell you more about what's coming up in New York for the important sixth anniversary.
[00:01:34.497 --> 00:01:41.562]  Luke Rudowsky of WeAreChange.org will be joining us coming up in the third hour as well.
[00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:44.264]  We will have open phones with Mike Rivera is on with us.
[00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:50.109]  And I'll also take some phone calls at the end of this hour on any issue, any news item, any topic.
[00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:53.231]  But I will, once I go to you, move quickly through the calls.
[00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:53.791]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:53.831 --> 00:01:58.795]  First time callers, if you tell us you're a first time caller, you go to the head of the line, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:09.694]  And if you're somebody calling in who disagrees, you then trump even first-time callers.
[00:02:10.074 --> 00:02:14.777]  Troy from West Virginia called in Sunday, but then he seemed crestfallen or beaten.
[00:02:14.837 --> 00:02:16.538]  He didn't really say much.
[00:02:16.578 --> 00:02:25.784]  He just kind of whimpered pathetically on the line, then denied that he ever called in on the studio line and posed.
[00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:37.551]  And then claim basically that he just never even got publicly spanked here on air by everybody calling daddy's dealership and quote, uh, firing him.
[00:02:40.974 --> 00:02:41.594]  So who knows?
[00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:43.496]  Troy might even pop in today.
[00:02:45.338 --> 00:02:47.039]  But he definitely did not sound happy.
[00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:48.040]  Okay, side issue.
[00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:49.982]  We have all these serious things going on.
[00:02:50.022 --> 00:02:52.064]  I'm talking about some ne'er do well from West Virginia.
[00:02:53.456 --> 00:02:56.897]  Here's the type of headlines I have in the stack in front of me today.
[00:02:57.537 --> 00:03:00.398]  Human animal embryo study wins approval.
[00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:04.379]  Cross-human chimeras to be legally created.
[00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.780]  And they've been doing this for decades.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.100]  Now they're just announcing it.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.781]  So we'll go over that report.
[00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:13.921]  That's the one in Guardian.
[00:03:13.941 --> 00:03:14.802]  There's another one here.
[00:03:16.222 --> 00:03:18.643]  This is London, the London Evening Standard.
[00:03:18.843 --> 00:03:19.843]  Very important report.
[00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.443]  The big news up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:23.523 --> 00:03:26.906]  Cheney orders media to sell attack on Iran.
[00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:27.746]  You heard me right.
[00:03:28.187 --> 00:03:32.590]  Fox News, Wall Street Journal instructed to launch PR blitz for upcoming military strike.
[00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:36.333]  So we'll be getting into that unbelievably important report.
[00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:39.816]  Edwards backs mandatory preventative care.
[00:03:39.876 --> 00:03:46.141]  This broke over the weekend and somehow I did the Sunday show and didn't even cover it.
[00:03:46.161 --> 00:03:47.502]  This is so much important stuff.
[00:03:48.067 --> 00:03:56.693]  He says that it doesn't matter if you're 17 years old, 15, 10, 5, 100, you'll be forced every year to go in and get government exams.
[00:03:56.713 --> 00:03:58.394]  I'm going to break down what this really means.
[00:03:59.615 --> 00:04:11.944]  They can sell well-meaning people on it by saying, well, thousands of people would survive every year if millions total in the world, and they were forced to have yearly checkups.
[00:04:14.438 --> 00:04:19.341]  That's not exactly true, so we're going to break that down early in the transmission today.
[00:04:21.162 --> 00:04:25.404]  Meanwhile, tying in all the military news, Chinese military hacked into the Pentagon.
[00:04:25.444 --> 00:04:26.245]  That is confirmed.
[00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:35.590]  Another story here out of the Financial Times of London is reporting the credit crisis as all the hallmarks of a classic bank run.
[00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:38.252]  I mean, just such important news.
[00:04:38.952 --> 00:04:40.753]  The quickening is happening right now.
[00:04:41.434 --> 00:04:42.815]  Everything is accelerating.
[00:04:42.895 --> 00:04:43.295]  Time.
[00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.519]  Space.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.360]  Technological developments.
[00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:47.661]  War making.
[00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:48.702]  Conflict.
[00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:49.682]  Passion.
[00:04:51.103 --> 00:04:52.764]  Everything is accelerating.
[00:04:54.465 --> 00:04:56.186]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:56.606 --> 00:05:00.549]  JonesReport.com and Infowars.net are just two of the websites.
[00:05:01.966 --> 00:05:06.929]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.470]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:16.994]  Our Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box, so it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[00:05:17.334 --> 00:05:20.356]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:05:20.656 --> 00:05:24.098]  So effective, you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[00:05:24.418 --> 00:05:33.784]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:05:34.044 --> 00:05:37.547]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:05:37.787 --> 00:05:44.892]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[00:05:45.152 --> 00:05:46.513]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.
[00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:48.294]  Get two for $70 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:06:01.421 --> 00:06:09.664]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:10.065 --> 00:06:17.668]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:25.464]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.864 --> 00:06:37.291]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.591 --> 00:06:41.134]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.554 --> 00:06:43.495]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.815 --> 00:06:47.678]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:06:48.258 --> 00:06:55.711]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:07:01.027 --> 00:07:05.130]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:10.474]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[00:07:10.754 --> 00:07:15.398]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[00:07:15.738 --> 00:07:17.719]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.864]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[00:07:24.224 --> 00:07:25.025]  And it works.
[00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.886]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[00:07:27.286 --> 00:07:28.287]  Now it's your turn.
[00:07:28.547 --> 00:07:30.908]  Today you can get a full bottle of Tautenol.
[00:07:31.068 --> 00:07:35.330]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:38.732]  See what Tautenol can do for you and your confidence.
[00:07:39.112 --> 00:07:41.314]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:43.855]  For your risk-free bottle of Tautenol, call 1-800-894-5152.
[00:07:43.915 --> 00:07:44.135]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[00:07:44.155 --> 00:07:46.036]  Tautenol is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.281]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:55.301 --> 00:07:56.682]  Rush Limbaugh was discovered by Roger Ailes
[00:08:22.415 --> 00:08:27.038]  ...who'd been a top Republican strategist, TV and radio station manager and owner.
[00:08:27.058 --> 00:08:38.164]  AM radio was dying... ...in the early 1980s... ...and he was able to go and lease satellite time...
[00:08:40.288 --> 00:08:52.998]  On the General Electric Satellite and put Rush Limbaugh on hundreds of stations and then go around and do PR promotions with the Republican Party to literally re-energize AM radio.
[00:08:53.038 --> 00:08:58.042]  And for that, that's an unintended consequence of these guys, but it certainly did happen.
[00:08:59.123 --> 00:09:00.484]  And it saved AM radio.
[00:09:00.964 --> 00:09:02.706]  There's a lot of great information that comes out on AM.
[00:09:03.587 --> 00:09:24.598]  I mean, even if you've got government stooges running the shows in many cases, or people that are camp followers and just agree with the ideology of big government that basically poses conservatives, still it allows people to call in, it's a long format where people have a lot of guests, and it is inducive towards more critical thinking and serious political discussions.
[00:09:25.778 --> 00:09:28.640]  It's a lot better than the 20-second soundbite of television.
[00:09:32.151 --> 00:09:37.016]  In a country, in a world where people don't read anymore predominantly, it's a godsend.
[00:09:39.798 --> 00:09:48.085]  But Rush Limbaugh and others literally came up and grew up into all of this as top Republican strategists.
[00:09:48.846 --> 00:09:53.190]  And Limbaugh of 15, 20 years ago is a 180 from the Limbaugh of today.
[00:09:53.831 --> 00:09:56.793]  I remember Rush Limbaugh saying that Gloria Steinem was CIA
[00:09:58.405 --> 00:10:06.629]  And then Gloria Steinem was hired to create Miss Magazine to break up the family and get women to have to work so they'd have to pay taxes.
[00:10:06.809 --> 00:10:07.509]  I didn't believe it.
[00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:14.833]  And my mother really wasn't what you'd call a modern feminist, but she did have the book on the shelf.
[00:10:15.593 --> 00:10:17.074]  I was still in high school then.
[00:10:17.174 --> 00:10:27.499]  I pulled it off the shelf, looked at the back of the book, found it in the glossary, in the index, and sure enough, Gloria Steinem was admitting that she was CIA.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:28.820]  And that Ms.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.581]  Magazine was CIA.
[00:10:31.141 --> 00:10:34.002]  You won't hear anything like that out of Rush Limbaugh now.
[00:10:36.683 --> 00:10:37.943]  So I'm digressing.
[00:10:38.863 --> 00:10:42.104]  He was not as controlled back then, and maybe Roger Ailes wasn't.
[00:10:42.124 --> 00:10:44.685]  It was a different Republican Party 20 years ago.
[00:10:45.385 --> 00:10:47.566]  That's when Limbaugh really got syndicated nationally.
[00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:51.187]  Hard to believe that was 20 years ago.
[00:10:52.247 --> 00:10:54.408]  And I was listening to him right when he got syndicated.
[00:10:54.448 --> 00:10:56.449]  I mean, I was in high school.
[00:10:56.529 --> 00:10:57.309]  I was like a junior.
[00:11:00.802 --> 00:11:02.183]  To give you an idea of how old I am.
[00:11:04.524 --> 00:11:11.127]  And here I am, I have all this world news in front of me, all this information, and I'm getting off into the history of Rush Limbaugh.
[00:11:11.268 --> 00:11:14.289]  And that's because that's the way I think, it's the way I operate.
[00:11:14.649 --> 00:11:29.277]  It's like when I see a headline, Cheney orders media to shell attack on Iran, I get up here on air and I say, even general listeners are going to have trouble believing that Dick Cheney actually orders Rush Limbaugh around.
[00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.752]  And then I think, well, how do I explain that history to them?
[00:11:35.192 --> 00:11:43.997]  And then I think about the history of Rush Limbaugh, and who's behind him, and how Roger Ailes is the head of Fox News.
[00:11:45.978 --> 00:11:54.942]  And I think about how they're behind Hillary, and then I think about all the evidence of Clinton being CIA, and being a protégé case officer under George Herbert Walker Bush.
[00:11:56.218 --> 00:12:04.644]  And I think about all the evidence of that and how it's staged and how I want to spend time warning the listeners and giving you footnotes and evidence and facts and proof of that.
[00:12:07.487 --> 00:12:11.950]  I mean that's really the problem and why I get frustrated more often than not and blow up on air.
[00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:19.656]  It's because verbally it's so hard to even put out all of this data and research and information because it's all interconnected.
[00:12:19.696 --> 00:12:21.357]  It's all cross-indexed in my brain.
[00:12:23.038 --> 00:12:24.960]  But let me just put it simply.
[00:12:27.151 --> 00:12:36.720]  A Sean Hannity, a Rush Limbaugh are directly on government payroll in many cases.
[00:12:38.081 --> 00:12:38.542]  And by that,
[00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:42.969]  Rush Limbaugh is paid more than his show makes.
[00:12:42.989 --> 00:12:44.290]  There's been press reports on that.
[00:12:44.711 --> 00:12:57.343]  I mean, the guy gets a $290-something million dollar salary on top of tens of millions a year of other payments, and then you look at the indexes and the numbers and the filings, he doesn't even make that much money for the network or stations.
[00:12:57.363 --> 00:13:00.827]  Well, that's separate.
[00:13:00.847 --> 00:13:02.008]  The stations are a separate entity.
[00:13:03.469 --> 00:13:04.010]  For the network.
[00:13:05.379 --> 00:13:07.040]  And then you say, well, what's going on there?
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.122]  Well, you hear who his advertisers are.
[00:13:09.242 --> 00:13:11.624]  It is a paid propaganda placement.
[00:13:15.067 --> 00:13:17.349]  That's why you hear Dick Cheney on there every other week.
[00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:24.515]  That's why you hear the heads of all the federal agencies on there, because he is in the inner circle.
[00:13:24.575 --> 00:13:27.797]  Now, others just know where their bread is buttered.
[00:13:27.857 --> 00:13:34.723]  They came up the Republican politics, they learn to be establishment hacks, they learn to be operatives, and they know what the
[00:13:36.457 --> 00:13:43.540]  Talking points are that are put out by Fox News and the Wall Street Journal and others every morning, and then they go out and parrot those talking points.
[00:13:46.442 --> 00:13:49.243]  The Democrats do the exact same thing through their mediums.
[00:13:51.604 --> 00:13:56.827]  And at the committee chairman and above level, they're all intermarried, they all vacation, their kids are married to each other.
[00:13:56.847 --> 00:13:59.908]  It is a complete joke.
[00:14:00.008 --> 00:14:03.330]  And I know we talk a lot about that, but that's really the key here.
[00:14:06.869 --> 00:14:12.546]  When you hear a neocon get up or you hear this America Watch group spending millions of dollars
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:21.644]  Every few days running TV, radio, and print ads saying, we don't need to be cowards, we don't need to surrender, America doesn't need to pull out of Iraq.
[00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:39.934]  Remember, they represent the people that are ending our currency, that are ending our borders, that are ending our sovereignty, that are going after our Second Amendment, that doubled the size of the federal government, that doubled the number of agents, and tripled the funding for the BATF,
[00:14:41.872 --> 00:14:50.399]  And if you just go down a chart of what is un-conservative, un-American, un-libertarian, un-free market, they fit the bill.
[00:14:50.439 --> 00:14:54.462]  From bed-rigging to insider trading, you can run the gamut.
[00:14:55.985 --> 00:15:00.228]  Corruption the likes of which we've never seen or even dreamed of.
[00:15:00.448 --> 00:15:15.780]  I, studying history, modern history, ancient history, I've studied a lot of it, cross-referenced, nothing other than Caligula, for just sheer insanity, marrying his horse and making it the head of the Senate and having them read portents out of its manure.
[00:15:19.202 --> 00:15:19.963]  All of that happened.
[00:15:23.052 --> 00:15:48.317]  So I guess Caligula and Nero had them top but that's about it just for general craziness but they do have the male madams and the underage people and the rest of it in there at the White House and so I guess in a way they may start marrying horses and reading the horse manure as you read tea leaves or bones or tarot cards.
[00:15:49.518 --> 00:15:51.398]  I mean it may come to that level of just
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.794]  Wanton, mindless, careening bedlam.
[00:16:01.115 --> 00:16:02.516]  They like being on the edge.
[00:16:02.556 --> 00:16:04.977]  They like coming right up to World War III.
[00:16:05.017 --> 00:16:06.598]  They want to start World War III.
[00:16:06.878 --> 00:16:09.679]  They want to put you on FEMA camps, because they can.
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.060]  Stalin could.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:11.780]  Hitler could.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.461]  Mao could.
[00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:13.801]  Pol Pot could.
[00:16:13.821 --> 00:16:15.322]  Fidel Castro could.
[00:16:15.722 --> 00:16:18.384]  Hundreds and hundreds of others could, so they did.
[00:16:18.404 --> 00:16:21.125]  Idi Amin could, so he did.
[00:16:21.665 --> 00:16:22.866]  They like it.
[00:16:23.827 --> 00:16:24.667]  They're bored.
[00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:37.036]  I mean, Bush, the President, with his brother, drove 170, 200 mile an hour high speed sea boats, and were in multiple races that people died in.
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.702]  Skydive, which is tame.
[00:16:42.942 --> 00:16:46.965]  They're involved in other, you know, dangerous things because they're bored, folks.
[00:16:47.345 --> 00:16:49.867]  They like watching buildings blow up.
[00:16:50.268 --> 00:16:52.730]  They like watching planes fly into towers.
[00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.952]  They like killing people.
[00:16:55.172 --> 00:16:56.253]  They're nihilistic.
[00:16:56.293 --> 00:16:57.253]  They're suicidal.
[00:16:57.514 --> 00:16:58.975]  They're in shame.
[00:17:03.104 --> 00:17:06.565]  And their controllers are, by and large, the Rothschilds or Rockefellers.
[00:17:06.605 --> 00:17:07.345]  They're old.
[00:17:07.545 --> 00:17:09.065]  They want to see the game plan.
[00:17:09.325 --> 00:17:11.446]  They want to see the New World Order before they go.
[00:17:15.447 --> 00:17:17.387]  You've got to understand their basic psychology.
[00:17:18.028 --> 00:17:22.549]  So, you read a headline like, Cheney orders media to sell attack on Iran.
[00:17:22.889 --> 00:17:24.089]  Paul wrote a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 page article.
[00:17:30.186 --> 00:17:40.228]  And I called him up this morning, I said, great article, but I said, there's nothing in there of the photo of, what, two years ago, all the Republican talk show hosts, like ten of them, around Bush, literally being given orders.
[00:17:40.288 --> 00:17:42.209]  I mean, they even publicly give the orders.
[00:17:42.249 --> 00:17:43.109]  Why don't you add that?
[00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:45.970]  Or add the 1.8 billion in fake news.
[00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.550]  That was just in one package for prescription drugs.
[00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:52.031]  What about the tens of billions others for buying reporters?
[00:17:54.852 --> 00:17:56.712]  Conservative talk show host Armstrong Williams.
[00:17:56.952 --> 00:17:59.513]  I've been on his show many times, where he attacked me each time.
[00:18:01.454 --> 00:18:02.855]  He's getting $240,000 in two separate payments.
[00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:06.177]  He was into his second year of payments.
[00:18:06.237 --> 00:18:06.477]  That's $488,000.
[00:18:06.517 --> 00:18:06.737]  It was $244,000.
[00:18:06.777 --> 00:18:13.521]  So $488,000 just to fly around the country and give 15 speeches a year and to say on his show that Head Start's conservative.
[00:18:26.937 --> 00:18:29.099]  And I only use that example because that's the one you know about.
[00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:36.363]  The media focused on him and a couple others and a New York Times writer with aluminum tubes getting a few hundred grand each time she wrote a story.
[00:18:36.624 --> 00:18:37.864]  That's pretty darn good, right?
[00:18:37.884 --> 00:18:39.546]  A story gets a couple hundred grand?
[00:18:42.488 --> 00:18:45.870]  You better believe these neocon talk show hoes pull the line.
[00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:47.251]  Tell the line.
[00:18:48.692 --> 00:18:51.574]  Limbaugh gets two hundred and ninety-something mil.
[00:18:52.828 --> 00:18:58.111]  In a nine-year contract, plus more than 15 million in merchandise and other considerations.
[00:18:59.352 --> 00:19:00.332]  What does that come out to?
[00:19:02.253 --> 00:19:03.914]  Hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:19:06.956 --> 00:19:09.357]  And so, just to read that headline,
[00:19:09.961 --> 00:19:14.083]  People are emailing and posting and saying, oh, you're making that up.
[00:19:14.343 --> 00:19:15.504]  No, we're not making that up.
[00:19:15.644 --> 00:19:23.127]  I could talk for ten hours and never stop, just literally, that's not a figure of speech, just covering how they're bought and paid for.
[00:19:26.689 --> 00:19:31.491]  I could tell the story of how I was approached seven years ago and they just said point blank.
[00:19:34.273 --> 00:19:38.975]  They said, you want to make a million plus a year just to start or do you want to be a loser?
[00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:42.141]  You got the right stuff, Mr. Jones.
[00:19:42.561 --> 00:19:43.802]  You can go right to the top.
[00:19:44.542 --> 00:19:46.604]  You can replace Rush Limbaugh.
[00:19:48.706 --> 00:19:50.187]  But you've got to turn to the dark side.
[00:19:50.987 --> 00:19:52.268]  And I said, you know what you can do?
[00:19:52.889 --> 00:19:55.271]  You can take it, and you know what you can do with it.
[00:19:56.532 --> 00:19:57.973]  That's how real this is.
[00:20:01.761 --> 00:20:06.365]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[00:20:06.565 --> 00:20:11.009]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[00:20:11.189 --> 00:20:25.222]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey Light Water Purifier, an LED Base, two Berkey Sport Filtration Bottles, the Berkey Battery Adapter, the Berkey MP Solar Charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:20:25.442 --> 00:20:44.627]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.
[00:20:44.847 --> 00:20:48.448]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[00:20:48.608 --> 00:20:51.269]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[00:21:01.772 --> 00:21:05.433]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:05.853 --> 00:21:11.274]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:11.735 --> 00:21:12.815]  It makes me wonder if a U.S.
[00:21:12.855 --> 00:21:16.896]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:17.556 --> 00:21:30.880]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:36.661]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:36.961 --> 00:21:42.843]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:21:43.604 --> 00:21:44.945]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:45.085 --> 00:21:49.631]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:21:50.072 --> 00:21:50.672]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.732 --> 00:21:52.895]  Exercise your legal rights to trade metals privately.
[00:21:52.915 --> 00:21:52.975]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.104 --> 00:22:03.085]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[00:22:03.345 --> 00:22:06.385]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:22:06.645 --> 00:22:11.427]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:14.467]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:22:14.727 --> 00:22:19.388]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[00:22:19.689 --> 00:22:21.589]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[00:22:22.069 --> 00:22:32.013]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology, and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[00:22:32.393 --> 00:22:37.095]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:40.977]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[00:22:41.197 --> 00:22:43.338]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[00:22:43.658 --> 00:22:45.819]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings,
[00:22:45.999 --> 00:22:47.801]  We'll even refund the shipping charge.
[00:22:48.081 --> 00:22:51.204]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[00:22:51.424 --> 00:22:52.325]  What are you waiting for?
[00:22:52.505 --> 00:22:53.185]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[00:22:53.286 --> 00:22:53.606]  That's 1-888-873-7371.
[00:22:53.646 --> 00:22:53.786]  Today!
[00:23:01.523 --> 00:23:03.364]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:03.504 --> 00:23:08.686]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:23:08.866 --> 00:23:10.207]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:23:10.467 --> 00:23:18.650]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:24.652]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:24.772 --> 00:23:26.533]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:23:26.613 --> 00:23:28.734]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:23:28.894 --> 00:23:33.141]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:23:33.322 --> 00:23:35.485]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:23:35.565 --> 00:23:42.918]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:23:44.226 --> 00:23:44.486]  We're good.
[00:24:03.097 --> 00:24:19.746]  I was listening to Michael Savage yesterday.
[00:24:21.447 --> 00:24:26.230]  He was talking about how Ritalin's destroying our children, how it's meant to destroy men.
[00:24:27.268 --> 00:24:28.089]  Men that would be leaders.
[00:24:28.189 --> 00:24:30.710]  He was talking about how bad chocolate is for children.
[00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.972]  He was talking about all these things that I've seen real medical reports on that I know are true.
[00:24:36.613 --> 00:24:39.935]  But then he goes into how Bush is fighting the one world government.
[00:24:40.635 --> 00:24:44.057]  When he's bought and paid for it, his daddy announced it and Bush pushes it.
[00:24:44.558 --> 00:24:46.499]  And is signing us on to carbon taxes now.
[00:24:46.579 --> 00:24:48.300]  See, that's what they do.
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:53.843]  Savage is a lot better than Limbaugh or Hannity who can't hide the fact that they're operatives.
[00:24:54.651 --> 00:25:05.454]  He is very, very good at 95% truth and then slipping in those key lies when it comes to killing all the Muslims, or the Arabs, or the rest of it.
[00:25:07.754 --> 00:25:09.355]  It's very, very convincing.
[00:25:09.715 --> 00:25:15.977]  It's like I saw some PBS TV show a few months ago about Winston Churchill.
[00:25:16.017 --> 00:25:18.577]  And it was shot in 35mm film.
[00:25:21.539 --> 00:25:26.624]  It was on PBS, and my mouth was hanging open how good it was, and it had me liking him by the end.
[00:25:26.944 --> 00:25:28.406]  But I knew that wasn't the truth!
[00:25:29.967 --> 00:25:31.629]  I knew he wasn't anti-socialist.
[00:25:32.209 --> 00:25:34.792]  He was on the surface, but he really helped push it and set it up.
[00:25:35.192 --> 00:25:37.294]  I knew that it was a big scam.
[00:25:38.796 --> 00:25:41.779]  I knew that what they were saying was... much of it was lies.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.081]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:25:44.121 --> 00:25:45.942]  They're good at what they do.
[00:25:46.262 --> 00:25:49.084]  That's why they're in control, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:49.325 --> 00:25:53.928]  And that's why we have to become conscious of the lying and become aware of what they're doing.
[00:25:58.511 --> 00:26:05.997]  91% of the American people in major Gallup polls, and I say that number because repeatedly 91% has come up, but you can be conservative, 80-plus percent.
[00:26:06.817 --> 00:26:09.840]  But the polls now show 90-plus, but let's be conservative.
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:10.440]  80-plus percent.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.843]  We want the borders shut and to control our sovereignty and to get it back.
[00:26:15.283 --> 00:26:15.983]  Government doesn't care.
[00:26:16.023 --> 00:26:17.244]  They just move forward against us.
[00:26:18.665 --> 00:26:20.627]  90 plus percent don't want toll roads in Texas.
[00:26:20.647 --> 00:26:21.287]  They just do it.
[00:26:21.547 --> 00:26:28.793]  And then say they're not going to put toll roads on the toll roads until everybody goes back to sleep a few months ago and now they announced on TV and radio yesterday, guess what?
[00:26:28.813 --> 00:26:30.754]  We're going to put toll roads on all the roads.
[00:26:31.875 --> 00:26:34.677]  Unless you let us have a gas tax increase.
[00:26:35.858 --> 00:26:37.579]  And then we'll only put toll roads on some.
[00:26:38.729 --> 00:26:39.850]  See how that lie works?
[00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:42.673]  Oh, well, if you give us a gas tax, it won't be on all the roads.
[00:26:42.973 --> 00:26:46.636]  Well, the underlying lie there is that we have the tax dot.
[00:26:46.656 --> 00:26:47.817]  This is just looking at one state.
[00:26:47.837 --> 00:26:48.658]  It's the same everywhere.
[00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:57.426]  With Texas having $6 billion in 2005 surplus and $8 billion in surplus gas tax in 2006.
[00:26:57.466 --> 00:27:04.012]  And each year, those surpluses just pile up into the tens of billions.
[00:27:05.467 --> 00:27:10.990]  Folks, University of Texas, in one fund, has got over $40 billion in liquid cash.
[00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:12.831]  Not even pension funds or investments.
[00:27:13.031 --> 00:27:18.735]  And they just raised taxes on the parking, they just increased the tuition, and they're going to increase it again, they just said.
[00:27:18.755 --> 00:27:20.316]  Because you're here to be raped!
[00:27:21.196 --> 00:27:21.396]  See?
[00:27:21.636 --> 00:27:23.497]  Until you get mad and figure it out.
[00:27:25.178 --> 00:27:27.940]  So you think UT is bad?
[00:27:28.644 --> 00:27:31.865]  The state won't even let people know what its total surpluses are.
[00:27:32.305 --> 00:27:39.108]  Those are just leaks that have come out in internal documents, and TxDOT has said they're accurate, but still they're not going to comment on them.
[00:27:41.429 --> 00:27:48.492]  I don't know, I mean, if they had $6 billion one year, $8 billion the next, and billions and billions each year before that, I have no idea how much money they've got.
[00:27:48.912 --> 00:27:49.932]  And they're not going to tell you!
[00:27:50.092 --> 00:27:51.693]  They won't even tell the legislature!
[00:27:52.193 --> 00:27:57.115]  And they've got DPS intelligence and thousands of men with weapons that'll enforce whatever they say!
[00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:14.607]  By the way, I've got the San Antonio Express News this weekend on that issue of mainline churches with the DPS in them in Texas spying on everybody.
[00:28:15.768 --> 00:28:16.910]  Mainline peace groups.
[00:28:17.231 --> 00:28:18.673]  Mainline conservative groups.
[00:28:20.828 --> 00:28:23.950]  They work for the corporations that own this state.
[00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.610]  Again, Texas a microcosm.
[00:28:25.811 --> 00:28:27.111]  I don't care if you live in North England.
[00:28:27.531 --> 00:28:30.173]  I don't care if you live on the Pirate Coast in Cornwall.
[00:28:30.513 --> 00:28:32.954]  I don't care if you live in Brittany in France.
[00:28:35.776 --> 00:28:38.117]  I don't care where you live, you're under these people.
[00:28:39.377 --> 00:28:40.918]  And it comes down to that, real simple.
[00:28:41.258 --> 00:28:44.180]  Hey, we got people with low IQs with weapons.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.582]  And if we say you're a criminal, they'll come after you.
[00:28:47.762 --> 00:28:48.242]  You got it?
[00:28:53.746 --> 00:29:04.096]  Bottom line, and I know I'm all over the map because it's all interconnected, but see that's what life's like for me because I'm informed.
[00:29:04.596 --> 00:29:10.842]  Because I know about toll roads and taxes and water districts and defense spending and committees.
[00:29:11.322 --> 00:29:13.204]  I've become an expert on that instead of football.
[00:29:18.266 --> 00:29:25.528]  That'd be like if I got up on air and you're a UT fan and I was announcing that Vince Young just played Arkansas last Saturday, you'd go, Vince Young's in the NFL.
[00:29:26.008 --> 00:29:27.628]  And I said, no, no, no, no, no, he's not.
[00:29:28.048 --> 00:29:32.789]  Well, see, that's the same thing when I hear somebody on the news from TxDOT going, we don't have enough money.
[00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:38.590]  We need to raise the gas tax and have toll roads on existing roads.
[00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:40.531]  It's a total lie.
[00:29:41.171 --> 00:29:42.371]  But you don't know that.
[00:29:43.952 --> 00:29:44.173]  See?
[00:29:44.793 --> 00:29:46.656]  And we're unable to reach most of the people.
[00:29:46.896 --> 00:29:50.240]  And so they just get lied to and get raped and raped.
[00:29:52.042 --> 00:29:52.964]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.424 --> 00:29:55.046]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.967 --> 00:29:58.651]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.792 --> 00:30:03.354]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.

[00:30:22.017 --> 00:30:25.639]  Two books that combined are over a thousand pages and other information.

[00:31:01.266 --> 00:31:05.849]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:31:06.249 --> 00:31:09.190]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:31:09.511 --> 00:31:12.072]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:31:12.432 --> 00:31:17.255]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:31:17.635 --> 00:31:22.998]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:31:23.298 --> 00:31:26.260]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.020]  We're good to go.
[00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:56.594]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.

[00:32:19.267 --> 00:32:25.974]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.

[00:33:20.674 --> 00:33:33.599]  My friends, when you've got a White House telling you that torture is good, when you've got a White House that wants to attack a third country, and is openly saying that Congress has no authority,
[00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:38.820]  Over the continuity of government, but that it's under United Nations control.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.121]  I have the actual Homeland Security document.
[00:33:43.781 --> 00:33:45.202]  Now, declassified.
[00:33:46.802 --> 00:33:48.863]  We are in a total crisis.
[00:33:49.803 --> 00:33:56.324]  And I know there are good police and good military and good men and women out there listening in every stripe and every sector of life.
[00:33:56.364 --> 00:33:58.725]  And I'm telling you, it's time for you to stop being in denial.
[00:33:59.807 --> 00:34:06.771]  It's time for you to choose sides and decide if you stand with the Republic for which it stands or against its enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:34:06.931 --> 00:34:09.792]  I assure you, I am not the enemy of this Republic.
[00:34:10.073 --> 00:34:12.354]  I bleed red, white, and blue.
[00:34:12.894 --> 00:34:19.558]  And I am so tired of watching traitorous, larcenous, wolves in sheep's clothing deceive my brethren.
[00:34:20.318 --> 00:34:28.162]  And to see you just so gullible like lambs from the slaughter being led by these Judas goats.
[00:34:28.262 --> 00:34:29.263]  I am so tired of it.
[00:34:32.395 --> 00:34:38.458]  I know we got a lot of phone lines, and I'm going to get to your calls here in just a few minutes, but I want to run through just the type of news I've got here in front of me.
[00:34:42.019 --> 00:34:51.143]  Friday we talked about how the new SPP meeting, Bush signed another secret of order, and it's all up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:51.163 --> 00:34:56.265]  Paul did a big story about it on Sunday with Jerome Corsi, Dr. Corsi's information, and right out of the
[00:34:57.029 --> 00:35:03.571]  Multi-hundred page document, where it says the UN runs, our government runs, our military runs, NORTHCOM, during emergencies.
[00:35:03.931 --> 00:35:10.253]  Meanwhile, that couples, you see, with PDD 51, saying Congress has nothing to do with it!
[00:35:11.013 --> 00:35:12.233]  Right there was high treason!
[00:35:12.293 --> 00:35:13.554]  Right there was martial law!
[00:35:14.134 --> 00:35:15.234]  That is engaging it.
[00:35:15.554 --> 00:35:16.475]  Taking the safety off.
[00:35:16.515 --> 00:35:17.435]  Putting their trigger on it.
[00:35:17.755 --> 00:35:18.835]  Putting their finger on the trigger.
[00:35:20.896 --> 00:35:24.397]  And then you fund the martial law with the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[00:35:27.811 --> 00:35:31.753]  And it's just, you put it all together, it's unbelievable!
[00:35:32.054 --> 00:35:34.295]  Each one of these things is an abomination.
[00:35:34.555 --> 00:35:36.116]  Each one of these is off the chart.
[00:35:36.816 --> 00:35:43.660]  Each one of these is Grade A, WDA choice brand tyranny.
[00:35:48.303 --> 00:35:51.024]  And you put them together, it's diabolical!
[00:35:51.505 --> 00:35:53.506]  And the incredible thing is, it's right out in the open.
[00:35:56.528 --> 00:36:19.262]  And they got their neocon talk show host everywhere talking about how we should be put in prison if we're against the war because we're fighting terrorists and then if you're against the war it means you're for the terrorists and we need to put people in work camps and we need to... and Malkin writes books about let's put everybody in camps and calls it the case for camps and I have her on the show and she defends putting people in camps.
[00:36:19.342 --> 00:36:20.923]  I mean they're just nuts man!
[00:36:25.065 --> 00:36:26.066]  But look at this story.
[00:36:27.083 --> 00:36:29.904]  Cheney orders media to sell attack on Iran.
[00:36:30.324 --> 00:36:34.965]  Fox News, Wall Street Journal instructed to launch PR blitz for upcoming military strike.
[00:36:35.405 --> 00:36:41.606]  And you put this together with all the aircraft carriers waiting, with globalist forces, used to be known as the U.S.
[00:36:41.626 --> 00:36:45.527]  military, grabbing Iranian diplomatic people.
[00:36:45.627 --> 00:36:46.927]  Three years ago, putting U.S.
[00:36:46.948 --> 00:36:49.948]  Special Forces into Iran, staging terror attacks all over the country.
[00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:53.509]  Comes out mainstream news here and the government says, yeah, we're trying to topple them.
[00:36:54.116 --> 00:36:55.397]  But don't you dare fight back.
[00:36:55.937 --> 00:36:58.539]  Sending insurgents in over their western border.
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:03.003]  Every time they fight back they call it military incursions into Iraq.
[00:37:03.804 --> 00:37:06.866]  Calling Iranian Shiites Sunnis.
[00:37:07.086 --> 00:37:07.767]  Opposite group.
[00:37:07.827 --> 00:37:08.707]  Calling them Al Qaeda.
[00:37:09.068 --> 00:37:09.788]  Opposite group.
[00:37:10.068 --> 00:37:12.010]  Just la la land level lying.
[00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:22.298]  I mean these lies are so big it's like saying Roger Stolbeck is still in the NFL and is the first string quarterback for the Cowboys.
[00:37:23.067 --> 00:37:24.167]  No, this isn't 1975.
[00:37:25.048 --> 00:37:33.751]  I mean, it's just... I'll start using those type analogies to try to reach in, you know, to people.
[00:37:33.771 --> 00:37:41.814]  That's like claiming that... I don't know who's some famous football player from 60 years ago.
[00:37:42.094 --> 00:37:45.235]  That's like saying Babe Ruth still plays for the Yankees.
[00:37:45.895 --> 00:37:47.416]  And we're going to watch Babe Ruth tonight.
[00:37:47.496 --> 00:37:48.316]  I mean, it's just...
[00:37:48.971 --> 00:37:54.334]  They lie to you with lies that are so big, I know I keep saying that, it just blows me away!
[00:37:54.855 --> 00:37:55.715]  It's incomplete!
[00:37:55.735 --> 00:37:57.056]  I mean, it's force majeure!
[00:37:57.296 --> 00:37:59.237]  What is even the reason to even debate this?
[00:37:59.697 --> 00:38:02.119]  You've got to remember, the general public doesn't know where the U.S.
[00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:03.119]  is on a map, folks.
[00:38:06.481 --> 00:38:08.383]  But they know that Al-Qaeda wants to get them.
[00:38:09.143 --> 00:38:13.065]  And they think Al-Qaeda, they think Iran is Australia on maps.
[00:38:13.105 --> 00:38:14.006]  I mean, they just don't know.
[00:38:17.111 --> 00:38:33.436]  Dick Cheney has ordered top neocon outlets, including Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, to unleash a PR blitz to sell a war with Iran from today, according to Barnett Rubin, a highly respected Afghanistan expert at New York Times, at New York University.
[00:38:34.917 --> 00:38:38.178]  And then you add to all this how Israel's saying, we want you to attack.
[00:38:38.538 --> 00:38:40.218]  Israel's saying they may go ahead and attack.
[00:38:40.258 --> 00:38:41.899]  Bush is saying he may go ahead and attack.
[00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:44.299]  Sarkozy comes out and says, we may attack.
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:45.980]  I support an attack.
[00:38:47.603 --> 00:38:49.443]  I mean, there's a hundred other points.
[00:38:49.483 --> 00:38:51.424]  I mean, they really are getting ready to do it!
[00:38:52.424 --> 00:38:55.865]  And just like I told you a year ago, they do this on purpose.
[00:38:55.905 --> 00:39:02.246]  They say they're going to attack in 2006, just so it'll become a foregone conclusion psychologically.
[00:39:03.106 --> 00:39:06.367]  Like most of us listening, we don't want to attack Iran.
[00:39:07.047 --> 00:39:09.528]  Seventy-plus percent of Americans don't want to attack Iran.
[00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:14.149]  Seventy-plus percent of the troops in major polls don't want to attack Iran.
[00:39:16.434 --> 00:39:21.375]  But just because we've been hearing about it for the last few years, it kind of becomes like, okay, get it over with.
[00:39:22.015 --> 00:39:27.997]  Deep down in the sick area of our souls, which we all have, I want to go ahead and see that.
[00:39:28.097 --> 00:39:29.077]  See what will happen.
[00:39:29.817 --> 00:39:32.058]  I've been hearing about it so much.
[00:39:33.638 --> 00:39:36.839]  People go to crash up derbies.
[00:39:36.859 --> 00:39:38.339]  You see people get hurt and people die.
[00:39:38.359 --> 00:39:40.700]  You don't go to NASCAR to see them race.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:41.680]  People go to see them wreck.
[00:39:43.797 --> 00:39:49.021]  Dale Earnhardt's a big hero, subconsciously, for everybody, because he died!
[00:39:53.684 --> 00:39:54.805]  People like seeing that!
[00:39:56.266 --> 00:40:02.650]  And so, at a sick level, it's even, and I'm able to analyze it and look at it, at a sick level, I'm even like, well, let's go ahead and see it then.
[00:40:03.271 --> 00:40:04.512]  Let's go ahead and have that war.
[00:40:05.112 --> 00:40:06.373]  I've been hearing about it so much.
[00:40:09.615 --> 00:40:10.696]  And see, it's the same thing.
[00:40:11.448 --> 00:40:12.388]  And it does something else.
[00:40:12.629 --> 00:40:20.572]  All these patriots and truth tellers, they get out and say the attack is on the 15th, the attack is on the 21st, the attack is on the... then they lose all credibility.
[00:40:21.332 --> 00:40:23.093]  And the people then get worn out.
[00:40:23.893 --> 00:40:28.095]  They attacked Iraq a year after they said, we're going to attack in March of 02, guaranteed.
[00:40:28.495 --> 00:40:30.756]  I got on air and I said, it's going to be March of 03, folks.
[00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:38.059]  Not just that they like to string these things out, but also because
[00:40:39.913 --> 00:40:42.515]  The Villeberg Group says that's when it's going to happen, and they run the world.
[00:40:45.438 --> 00:41:03.113]  So it's basic psychology here, and they are geared up now, and it may not even be this year, folks, it may be next spring, but I'm telling you, just like Ron Paul said, before they leave office, they intend to attack that country, and if Iran lifts a finger to defend themselves, it's going to be called terrorism,
[00:41:03.903 --> 00:41:12.226]  The public is so dumbed down, they will actually, even though they're against the war, consciously, subconsciously, they're going to be drinking liquor, eating food, watching TV.
[00:41:13.107 --> 00:41:27.052]  A few that came over to the side of being anti-war will be swayed back over, because they'll be associating the bombardment with their own personal power, even though they're fitting the bill for it, and their name's being destroyed forever, the country's name's being destroyed forever.
[00:41:28.213 --> 00:41:28.793]  They don't care.
[00:41:31.275 --> 00:41:34.619]  And so you add this, and you can see the push the last month.
[00:41:34.679 --> 00:41:36.922]  I mean, they've been all over the map.
[00:41:37.002 --> 00:41:38.924]  CNN, MSNBC, Fox.
[00:41:39.665 --> 00:41:41.847]  Iran is run by vampires.
[00:41:41.867 --> 00:41:42.868]  They drink blood.
[00:41:43.749 --> 00:41:45.191]  They could kill us any minute.
[00:41:45.471 --> 00:41:46.612]  They want to nuke Israel.
[00:41:48.396 --> 00:41:53.578]  It doesn't matter if the CIA says they're 8 to 9 years away from even having a device, much less delivery.
[00:41:53.798 --> 00:42:04.583]  It doesn't matter if they attacked Israel, that Israel's got at least 400 plus nuclear weapons, submarines, long-range missiles, cruise missiles, fighter-bombers, everything you can imagine.
[00:42:07.004 --> 00:42:11.406]  It doesn't matter that if Iran attacked Israel, they would become a glass parking lot.
[00:42:13.587 --> 00:42:14.467]  It doesn't matter!
[00:42:16.135 --> 00:42:27.062]  It doesn't matter that every major strategic expert that isn't a neocon says it's insane that gas will go to $9 a gallon bare minimum, $200 a barrel crude.
[00:42:28.663 --> 00:42:31.725]  It doesn't matter if the dollar will then plunge even further.
[00:42:32.305 --> 00:42:36.288]  It doesn't matter that it will fry the stock market.
[00:42:38.877 --> 00:42:42.501]  Because it gives the New World Order what it wants, and that's World War III.
[00:42:42.761 --> 00:42:44.623]  And then the wars, they're not going to stop in Iran.
[00:42:44.663 --> 00:42:45.944]  You don't think they're going to stop there, do you?
[00:42:50.234 --> 00:43:04.180]  You wanted to be drafted, you wanted to be on food stamps, you wanted to be on food rations, you wanted to have the local goon neighbor now in a black uniform telling you what to do and telling you you better give them your wife or they're going to report you as a terrorist.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:08.702]  You wanted to be slaves, yuppies and neocons and liberals.
[00:43:08.962 --> 00:43:10.163]  You wanted to follow Hillary.
[00:43:10.443 --> 00:43:11.683]  I look at the liberal scum.
[00:43:12.024 --> 00:43:14.065]  Man, they love her, she's ten points ahead.
[00:43:14.085 --> 00:43:17.266]  I mean, as bad as Barack Obama is, you know Hillary's bad.
[00:43:18.314 --> 00:43:18.955]  They don't care.
[00:43:18.995 --> 00:43:20.136]  They like being lied to.
[00:43:20.396 --> 00:43:21.778]  They like being established.
[00:43:21.938 --> 00:43:23.079]  They like being fooled.
[00:43:24.721 --> 00:43:28.084]  Well, you're going to get to be in a real live empire then.
[00:43:28.104 --> 00:43:34.932]  You know, I've got a lot I'm going to talk about.
[00:43:34.972 --> 00:43:35.833]  I'll get to your calls.
[00:43:35.853 --> 00:43:39.677]  I know everybody's holding them, but I've got to cover this news.
[00:43:42.702 --> 00:43:45.564]  Cheney orders media to sell attack on Iran.
[00:43:45.664 --> 00:43:51.228]  Fox News, Wall Street Journal instructed to launch PR blitz for upcoming military strike.
[00:43:52.708 --> 00:44:10.080]  The New Yorker magazine reports that Rubin had a conversation with a member of the top neoconservative institution in Washington who told him that instructions had been passed from the office of vice president to roll out a campaign for war with Iran in the week after Labor Day.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.121]  It will be coordinated
[00:44:12.887 --> 00:44:20.372]  With the American Enterprise Institute, the Wall Street Journal, the Weekly Standard, and commentary on Fox, Usual Suspects, writes Rubin.
[00:44:20.732 --> 00:44:22.674]  And that's exactly how we've told you they do it.
[00:44:23.394 --> 00:44:24.715]  Those are the key talking points.
[00:44:24.775 --> 00:44:26.036]  People know to keep their jobs.
[00:44:26.456 --> 00:44:27.417]  They just go get that.
[00:44:28.038 --> 00:44:29.118]  They read what it says.
[00:44:30.419 --> 00:44:34.282]  That's why it's a little scary to have all of them attacking me, as they did two weeks ago.
[00:44:35.042 --> 00:44:35.963]  That was a talking point.
[00:44:37.704 --> 00:44:39.646]  I mean, I'm in White House talking points, folks.
[00:44:39.926 --> 00:44:41.507]  Because I know their game plan.
[00:44:45.566 --> 00:44:47.447]  But I have to do it for my country and my family.
[00:44:49.088 --> 00:44:51.309]  Believe me, I don't play with death.
[00:44:51.409 --> 00:44:54.871]  I don't tease bulls out in the middle of the field for no reason.
[00:44:55.372 --> 00:44:56.432]  They came for us.
[00:44:56.512 --> 00:44:57.473]  They came for the country.
[00:44:57.713 --> 00:45:06.658]  I, as an American, and in the fine tradition of being a good Texan, have to stand up against tyranny, no matter what the cost is, liberty or death, victory or death.
[00:45:07.358 --> 00:45:08.859]  And so they know who their enemies are.
[00:45:08.899 --> 00:45:09.319]  They know.
[00:45:09.639 --> 00:45:10.500]  There's not many of them.
[00:45:11.354 --> 00:45:16.497]  Most of the Patriot leaders out there get a piece of it, or they think Roosevelt's going to save us, or they think, you know what I mean.
[00:45:17.597 --> 00:45:19.938]  They attack me because they know I've got their number.
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:31.124]  Fox and the usual suspects, writes Rubin, it will be heavily sustained assault on the airwaves designed to knock public sentiment into a position from which a war can be maintained.
[00:45:31.984 --> 00:45:34.846]  Eventually, they don't think they will ever get
[00:45:36.053 --> 00:45:37.274]  Majority support for this.
[00:45:37.334 --> 00:45:41.438]  They want something like 35 or 40 percent support, which in their book is plenty.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:52.409]  Rubin subsequently confirmed with a second source that the propaganda coup had been launched, and that the individual and other top neocon and a major think tank had this to say about it.
[00:45:52.969 --> 00:45:53.970]  I am a Republican.
[00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:55.071]  I am a conservative.
[00:45:55.451 --> 00:46:00.136]  But this... But I'm not a raging lunatic.
[00:46:00.196 --> 00:46:01.237]  This is lunatic.
[00:46:02.538 --> 00:46:21.402]  An organized mass media campaign to popularize for a military strike on Iran mirrors exactly what happened in late 2002 in preparation for the invasion of Iraq, and would be seen as par for the course in anticipation of an attack that presidential candidate Ron Paul, amongst other expert observers, fear will take place within the next 12 months.
[00:46:21.442 --> 00:46:25.723]  And then it goes on into how they're bought and paid for and the proof of that.
[00:46:26.504 --> 00:46:28.184]  And this is what concerns me even more.
[00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:48.048]  We don't think, I said it at the time because I've learned to study these people and learned what their moves mean, learned what their jukes mean, that is when they faint one way I know they're going the other, that Tommy Franks was on government payroll
[00:46:49.076 --> 00:46:50.157]  I said Pentagon payroll.
[00:46:50.197 --> 00:46:50.617]  I was right.
[00:46:50.657 --> 00:46:51.437]  I was exactly right.
[00:46:51.457 --> 00:46:52.038]  It wasn't hard.
[00:46:52.538 --> 00:46:57.280]  When he was all over TV and radio and print saying, Martial Law's coming after the next attack.
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.621]  Gee shucks, it's too bad, but you know what?
[00:46:59.641 --> 00:47:00.402]  It's what the people want.
[00:47:00.462 --> 00:47:01.282]  It'll keep us safe.
[00:47:01.722 --> 00:47:03.643]  He created that idea.
[00:47:04.104 --> 00:47:04.684]  Or pushed it.
[00:47:06.185 --> 00:47:08.986]  And then I saw Governor Ridge introduce it three years ago.
[00:47:09.026 --> 00:47:10.707]  And I've seen others introduce it.
[00:47:10.727 --> 00:47:12.388]  And we've got to get rid of Posse Comitatus.
[00:47:12.468 --> 00:47:14.849]  And now they're getting it all positioned.
[00:47:15.859 --> 00:47:22.765]  And now they have all their little birdies tweeting and saying that, and they've signed the executive orders and the PDDs, and they've got it all lined up!
[00:47:26.328 --> 00:47:28.410]  And that means they really are going to do it!
[00:47:29.351 --> 00:47:30.852]  They really are going to do it!
[00:47:31.533 --> 00:47:37.358]  And if you get out of line and bitch and complain, they'll just nuke Chicago and say, Al-Qaeda did that, are you going to complain anymore?
[00:47:37.378 --> 00:47:41.041]  Because if you don't do exactly what we say, more bombs are going to go off.
[00:47:42.296 --> 00:47:43.937]  More planes are going to fly into buildings.
[00:47:44.337 --> 00:47:45.458]  More people are going to die.
[00:47:45.658 --> 00:47:52.381]  And let me tell you, the majority of these cowardly soft scum out here will line up, and even in their gut, they'll know the government of the terrorists.
[00:47:52.641 --> 00:47:57.363]  But they won't be able to deal with the fear of that, and so they will just say it's Al Qaeda.
[00:47:58.504 --> 00:48:07.428]  You see, when these top think tank experts go on Fox, and go on History Channel, and attack us, and say, we say it's Al Qaeda, because we can't
[00:48:08.488 --> 00:48:13.172]  Or, we say it's the government because we can't deal with the fear of it being Al-Qaeda.
[00:48:14.012 --> 00:48:15.393]  Now weigh that statement!
[00:48:18.016 --> 00:48:32.727]  We say it's Al-Qaeda because... because... Let me restate that.
[00:48:33.473 --> 00:48:38.618]  I get to thinking and extrapolating out on three or four other thoughts and then I get lost when I was saying.
[00:48:41.341 --> 00:48:46.145]  We say that it's the government, that is the Patriot Truth Movement, because we're so afraid of Al Qaeda.
[00:48:46.346 --> 00:48:46.926]  Let's weigh that.
[00:48:47.347 --> 00:48:48.167]  What's scary?
[00:48:48.227 --> 00:48:49.789]  Having a government that runs everything?
[00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:51.130]  That's staging terror attacks?
[00:48:51.771 --> 00:48:53.813]  Or some badly coordinated guys in a cave?
[00:48:55.214 --> 00:48:57.997]  Well, it's a lot more scary to have a corrupt, tyrannical government.
[00:49:00.229 --> 00:49:04.551]  On it's face, that's a no-brainer, than to have badly coordinated people in a cave.
[00:49:07.833 --> 00:49:08.674]  And everybody knows that.
[00:49:09.114 --> 00:49:12.316]  But see, they're really telling you what they already know, but just the reverse of it.
[00:49:13.036 --> 00:49:15.497]  They know that we know it's an inside job.
[00:49:15.557 --> 00:49:18.299]  They know the majority in polls believe it's an inside job.
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.881]  But talking to your neighbors, you won't admit that most of the time.
[00:49:24.482 --> 00:49:29.305]  Because deep down, you want to believe it's Al-Qaeda, because that's a lot less scary.
[00:49:32.654 --> 00:49:36.276]  And they tell the truth in other ways when they say the terrorists attacked us because they hate our freedom.
[00:49:36.577 --> 00:49:38.098]  The globalists hate our freedom, folks.
[00:49:38.118 --> 00:49:39.098]  That's why they attacked us.
[00:49:39.158 --> 00:49:39.599]  It's true.
[00:49:40.019 --> 00:49:42.240]  The terrorists attacked us because they hate our freedom.
[00:49:49.105 --> 00:49:51.166]  And then I have all this other news in front of me.
[00:49:51.846 --> 00:49:54.508]  Remember, John Edwards came out and said he wants socialized health care.
[00:49:54.528 --> 00:49:55.849]  We're already being walked into that.
[00:49:55.869 --> 00:49:58.931]  We're already incrementally being brought into socialized health care right now.
[00:50:00.852 --> 00:50:01.953]  And then I see this headline
[00:50:06.386 --> 00:50:09.687]  Those that have unhealthy lifestyles should not be given treatment.
[00:50:09.727 --> 00:50:11.348]  See, that's the next step.
[00:50:12.848 --> 00:50:21.811]  And I can't even do justice to that story of why is it a bad idea to have socialized health care, A. Well, because then they say you've got to get treatment.
[00:50:22.991 --> 00:50:29.013]  Then they say you've got to live up to their standards of health and eat what they say and you've got to be surveilled and tracked and watched.
[00:50:30.173 --> 00:50:35.195]  Not to mention then they can forcibly inject you with vaccines when they're a bunch of eugenicists.
[00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:37.511]  See, and there's hundreds of other reasons.
[00:50:38.592 --> 00:50:42.535]  But I hear people on talk radio calling in going, you know, it'll save lives.
[00:50:42.615 --> 00:50:45.617]  If my daddy would have got an earlier checkup, he wouldn't have died of cancer.
[00:50:47.039 --> 00:50:50.942]  Yeah, if we had angels running the health care, it'd probably be a good idea.
[00:50:51.342 --> 00:50:52.303]  We don't, folks.
[00:50:52.683 --> 00:50:56.506]  We have eugenicists running the policy and doctors that don't ask questions.
[00:50:56.946 --> 00:50:59.748]  So in Nazi Germany, do you want to have to be made to go see the doctor?
[00:51:05.021 --> 00:51:08.164]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.524 --> 00:51:10.505]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.866 --> 00:51:18.531]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.212 --> 00:51:26.257]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.658 --> 00:51:33.583]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:34.016 --> 00:51:38.059]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:41.882]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.343 --> 00:51:44.304]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.605 --> 00:51:48.528]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.647 --> 00:52:04.669]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:04.989 --> 00:52:09.912]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:10.152 --> 00:52:14.515]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.815 --> 00:52:23.720]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:27.583]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.843 --> 00:52:30.484]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or
[00:52:31.425 --> 00:52:32.866]  For one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:33.166 --> 00:52:39.890]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:41.031]  What about you?
[00:52:41.671 --> 00:52:46.574]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.
[00:52:46.614 --> 00:52:47.034]  A $14 savings.
[00:52:47.094 --> 00:52:48.115]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.

[00:53:01.517 --> 00:53:01.937]  Attention!
[00:53:02.077 --> 00:53:04.038]  This is an urgent GCN News Bulletin!
[00:53:04.238 --> 00:53:08.501]  Honeybees are now mysteriously vanishing at an astonishing pace across the entire country.
[00:53:08.661 --> 00:53:11.582]  Why is this urgent message about honeybees so desperately important?
[00:53:11.822 --> 00:53:12.763]  The answer is easy.
[00:53:12.903 --> 00:53:19.126]  You see, honeybees produce a unique compound, fed only to the queen, that makes her live six times longer than other bees in the hive.
[00:53:19.346 --> 00:53:23.388]  Some researchers now believe the compound may have miraculous effects on humans as well.
[00:53:23.568 --> 00:53:25.009]  The compound is called Royal Gelatin.
[00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.429]  I think so.
[00:53:44.508 --> 00:53:45.229]  We're good to go.
[00:54:17.483 --> 00:54:20.723]  Our story, Cheney orders media to sell ATT&CK on Iran.
[00:54:20.743 --> 00:54:22.764]  Went on the front page of Digg.
[00:54:23.244 --> 00:54:25.324]  Then it's supposed to move down as others go above it.
[00:54:25.965 --> 00:54:27.925]  They just erased it right out of the top queue.
[00:54:27.965 --> 00:54:28.705]  I watched them do it.
[00:54:29.265 --> 00:54:30.586]  That didn't have the Digg system works.
[00:54:30.646 --> 00:54:32.306]  It wasn't even buried.
[00:54:32.406 --> 00:54:33.226]  They just removed it.
[00:54:33.966 --> 00:54:34.647]  It's what they do.
[00:54:35.387 --> 00:54:39.588]  Just like Google Video set all our hits again and took us out of the top 100 again.
[00:54:40.148 --> 00:54:41.068]  Whole bunch of our videos.
[00:54:42.637 --> 00:54:45.078]  They do everything they can to stop the truth from getting out, folks.
[00:54:46.218 --> 00:54:47.859]  Let you know how real this fight is, doesn't it?
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:58.363]  More often than not, I'd say 99 times out of 100, countries go bad and you get tyranny, and it's happening big and bad here.
[00:55:00.283 --> 00:55:04.945]  And you got millions of Americans who think they're part of the power structure, who go along with whatever they're told.
[00:55:06.701 --> 00:55:07.342]  Call Rivero.
[00:55:07.382 --> 00:55:08.843]  Let's get him on about 15 in.
[00:55:08.923 --> 00:55:10.845]  I want to be able to get to these calls when we start the next hour.
[00:55:10.885 --> 00:55:13.508]  At least these four or five in queue that have been holding the longest.
[00:55:15.289 --> 00:55:18.532]  I love to get Rivero's take on everything with the war and the rest of it.
[00:55:18.552 --> 00:55:20.814]  A little program note.
[00:55:21.395 --> 00:55:25.239]  I noticed Friday that all the shows had sold out for endgame.
[00:55:25.339 --> 00:55:26.420]  And I thought, that's weird.
[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:27.701]  Man, they really sold out quick.
[00:55:28.374 --> 00:55:36.802]  And then their shopping cart, their ticketing system over at the Alamo had it set to only sell half the tickets online and make you buy the rest of the half at the door.
[00:55:38.904 --> 00:55:44.349]  And I found out that they've done that this morning, so I had them change it to where you can buy 90% of the tickets online.
[00:55:44.429 --> 00:55:45.791]  Now, tonight is sold out.
[00:55:46.691 --> 00:55:48.133]  People went ahead and just bought them at the door.
[00:55:48.833 --> 00:55:51.416]  Tomorrow night, for some reason, has like 60 tickets left.
[00:55:51.969 --> 00:55:53.370]  You can go online right now.
[00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:58.371]  If you want to go see Endgame here in Austin, Texas, tomorrow night, 7 o'clock, I'll be there giving a speech.
[00:55:58.491 --> 00:56:00.132]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:00.152 --> 00:56:03.233]  It says at the very top, Endgame Premiere, Alex Jones live in person.
[00:56:03.273 --> 00:56:03.853]  Click on that.
[00:56:04.113 --> 00:56:08.175]  It'll take you to their area on the Alamo Draft House website.
[00:56:08.215 --> 00:56:14.217]  They've changed it now so you can buy tickets, 90% of the tickets, and then it'll say unavailable when those sell out.
[00:56:14.657 --> 00:56:20.039]  And then tomorrow night's almost sold out, but there are a few tickets left there, and then they leave like 20, 25 at the door you can still get.
[00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:24.918]  Uh, and so just if you want tickets, I want to see you there tomorrow night and the next night.
[00:56:25.158 --> 00:56:26.501]  And then there's tickets still available on the 17th.
[00:56:26.541 --> 00:56:28.986]  We're going to show it one more time there as well.
[00:56:29.287 --> 00:56:30.489]  Tickets are available.
[00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:32.033]  Sorry that folks got locked out.
[00:56:32.948 --> 00:56:39.212]  And we're unable to get tickets, but if you want to get them online, you can do that right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:56:39.252 --> 00:56:48.679]  If you've got a friend, or family member, or neighbor, or co-worker, or pastor who isn't aware of what's happening in the New World Order, take them to see the film in-game.
[00:56:49.059 --> 00:56:50.700]  It won't be out until mid-October, folks.
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:52.581]  This is your chance to get a sneak peek at it.
[00:56:55.703 --> 00:56:56.624]  Alright, again,
[00:56:58.852 --> 00:57:00.092]  We need to have a DIG revolt.
[00:57:00.193 --> 00:57:10.096]  DIG is thousands of places higher than World Net Daily, hundreds of places higher, millions of visitors a day on their main page than the Drugs Report.
[00:57:11.517 --> 00:57:15.178]  And when we get up there, we're able to really break out and have stories go supernova.
[00:57:15.848 --> 00:57:20.730]  Since we started using it to defeat the enemy, they admittedly go in and shut us down.
[00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:22.171]  We still slip through.
[00:57:22.191 --> 00:57:26.813]  About 1 out of 20 attacks connects through their defenses.
[00:57:27.513 --> 00:57:32.015]  And they claim it's a free market system where you voted up, but it isn't really that way.
[00:57:32.055 --> 00:57:32.596]  It's a fraud.
[00:57:33.176 --> 00:57:36.297]  We still are able to beat them even though they've got a stacked deck.
[00:57:37.578 --> 00:57:40.979]  And I think we need to have a big revolt over this.
[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:44.561]  They had a few months ago a big revolt where they covered up
[00:57:45.536 --> 00:57:50.637]  Uh, some other news information on there with a separate issue and there was a big revolt.
[00:57:50.738 --> 00:57:51.838]  I'm asking for a big revolt.
[00:57:52.218 --> 00:57:53.878]  I'm saying post it hundreds of times.
[00:57:54.299 --> 00:57:55.599]  I'm saying go in there.
[00:57:55.919 --> 00:57:57.419]  I'm saying email them, complain.
[00:57:57.719 --> 00:58:02.901]  Google took Marshall Law down for two months when it got 700 plus thousand views in three days.
[00:58:02.921 --> 00:58:04.721]  They just took it down.
[00:58:05.001 --> 00:58:06.922]  Your complaints made them repost it.
[00:58:08.189 --> 00:58:10.851]  It just suddenly reappeared and they apologized and said it was an accident.
[00:58:11.271 --> 00:58:12.252]  Not an accident, folks.
[00:58:13.593 --> 00:58:15.734]  I say, turn loose the dogs.
[00:58:16.034 --> 00:58:16.835]  Go after Digg.
[00:58:17.055 --> 00:58:17.896]  I've had enough of it.
[00:58:18.156 --> 00:58:25.401]  I've had enough of them posing and claiming that they're a real news organization and this real democratization when they're not!
[00:58:27.422 --> 00:58:28.603]  Turn the programmers loose.
[00:58:28.623 --> 00:58:29.403]  Turn everybody loose.
[00:58:29.684 --> 00:58:30.904]  And by that, I don't mean hack them.
[00:58:31.385 --> 00:58:33.506]  I mean the programmers to track how they do censor.
[00:58:33.726 --> 00:58:34.507]  That's been done before.
[00:58:35.274 --> 00:58:36.495]  Alright, just tear them up!
[00:58:36.515 --> 00:58:38.736]  If they want to fight, let's stop them!
[00:58:42.039 --> 00:58:46.321]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.677 --> 00:59:01.859]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.320]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:04.981]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.001 --> 00:59:09.363]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.823 --> 00:59:13.945]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.426 --> 00:59:16.927]  Well, chilling developments.
[00:59:16.987 --> 00:59:23.210]  We have confirmed that talking points have been issued to all the top neocons from the Weekly Standard, the Wall Street Journal,
[00:59:24.941 --> 00:59:28.023]  To start the PR Blitz for the actual attack on Iran.
[00:59:28.784 --> 00:59:32.547]  They are moving right now, ladies and gentlemen, the Info War is joined.
[00:59:32.887 --> 00:59:34.588]  More on that with Mike Rivera in 15 minutes.
[00:59:35.068 --> 00:59:41.933]  Chimera cross-human, literal island of Dr. Maru News coming up, cross-human embryo studies.
[00:59:43.374 --> 00:59:43.795]  We will
[00:59:46.758 --> 00:59:51.262]  Also, get into how protests of the APEC meeting are banned.
[00:59:51.943 --> 00:59:53.504]  This is total police state.
[00:59:53.945 --> 00:59:58.709]  Edwards wants mandatory health care, and that means that if you don't eat what they say, you're denied health care.
[00:59:58.769 --> 00:59:59.389]  We've got that.
[01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:01.231]  Just total control.
[01:00:02.592 --> 01:00:03.893]  Serious market news.
[01:00:03.993 --> 01:00:05.054]  Michael Rivero coming up.
[01:00:05.094 --> 01:00:06.095]  Right now, let's go to your calls.
[01:00:06.195 --> 01:00:06.496]  Quickly.
[01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:07.977]  Ken in Texas and Richard Derrick.
[01:00:09.113 --> 01:00:10.574]  Aaron and Roman and others.
[01:00:10.635 --> 01:00:11.255]  Ken, go ahead.
[01:00:11.836 --> 01:00:12.596]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:00:12.616 --> 01:00:13.937]  This is Ken up in Paris, Texas.
[01:00:14.118 --> 01:00:14.658]  Thanks for holding.
[01:00:14.698 --> 01:00:15.279]  What's on your mind?
[01:00:15.479 --> 01:00:15.719]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:15.739 --> 01:00:19.703]  I was just going to call because I heard you say earlier I had to catch a rebroadcast and time's going to be working.
[01:00:19.723 --> 01:00:21.844]  I had a short break and listened to your live broadcast today.
[01:00:21.864 --> 01:00:31.553]  But I heard you say something recently about how the Wall Street Journal, someone's saying that they're going to try to prevent, if they can, a collapse of our financial markets in September, if I heard correctly.
[01:00:31.613 --> 01:00:33.515]  Like, they're going to try to keep that from happening.
[01:00:34.232 --> 01:00:36.493]  For example, I don't know if it's Walt.
[01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:39.455]  Yes, I actually have the article in the stack.
[01:00:39.495 --> 01:00:41.096]  It's Financial Times of London.
[01:00:42.396 --> 01:00:44.558]  You know what, I don't want to say what headline it is until I dig it out.
[01:00:44.578 --> 01:00:45.818]  I've got it here in one of the stacks.
[01:00:46.319 --> 01:00:50.641]  And yes, they're saying that they're trying to stop a financial collapse.
[01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:56.404]  Also, they're saying there's the equivalent of a run on banks going on right now, but it's other financial securities.
[01:00:57.104 --> 01:00:58.805]  And very, very serious.
[01:00:58.845 --> 01:00:59.846]  That's coming up in this hour.
[01:01:00.266 --> 01:01:00.506]  Yes.
[01:01:00.947 --> 01:01:01.828]  That's the problem.
[01:01:02.228 --> 01:01:04.210]  Our government was handed over to U.N.
[01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:04.771]  control.
[01:01:05.251 --> 01:01:05.992]  Mainstream.
[01:01:06.012 --> 01:01:07.033]  We have the documents.
[01:01:07.694 --> 01:01:08.935]  I don't even have time to cover that.
[01:01:09.836 --> 01:01:11.417]  We're being hit from every side, Ken.
[01:01:11.758 --> 01:01:12.098]  Right.
[01:01:12.138 --> 01:01:12.559]  I've heard you.
[01:01:13.079 --> 01:01:18.304]  In the last hour, you really laid a strong foundation about what's happening and what most likely probably is going to happen.
[01:01:20.487 --> 01:01:25.794]  Well, it seems like a lot of signs are there to make us think that maybe the powers will be going to try to pull something soon.
[01:01:25.834 --> 01:01:34.166]  I know there's no way to put a time or date on it, but I'm just saying it looks like they're looking at a short-term type situation where something's going to happen to take us into full-scale martial law.
[01:01:35.287 --> 01:01:42.673]  There is no doubt, they have funded it, they have their PR people out being paid to say it, and yes, they are actually going to try it.
[01:01:43.153 --> 01:01:54.763]  Okay, folks, I've never before on air said, this is the time, they're getting ready, not ten years ago when good old boys would call in and get mad when I'd say, no, Bill Clinton isn't planning to take over, he's setting the table.
[01:01:55.103 --> 01:01:55.984]  They're gearing up.
[01:01:56.225 --> 01:01:57.647]  They're going to pass the baton.
[01:01:57.907 --> 01:02:02.634]  They may gear it up and make a foregone conclusion and Hillary comes in and a nuke goes off in L.A.
[01:02:02.674 --> 01:02:03.315]  or Chicago.
[01:02:03.715 --> 01:02:06.519]  All I know is they are making a run for it.
[01:02:10.151 --> 01:02:12.952]  Unfortunately, it looks like something in the shorter term is going to probably be happening.
[01:02:12.972 --> 01:02:15.933]  They're going to try to do something to put us into full-scale martial law then.
[01:02:16.213 --> 01:02:21.415]  Yes, and they may, you know, just blow up a small part of the city or fly a plane into a building again.
[01:02:21.475 --> 01:02:25.897]  It may be smaller and kind of inches in a little bit deeper or it could be spectacular.
[01:02:26.837 --> 01:02:29.998]  I mean, there's no telling what the Russians and Chinese may do if they hit Iran.
[01:02:30.338 --> 01:02:30.999]  There's no telling.
[01:02:31.019 --> 01:02:32.819]  The market we know is going to go in the toilet.
[01:02:33.359 --> 01:02:35.220]  I mean, this is a self-inflicted wound.
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:37.801]  Attacking Iran is going to hurt these yuppies.
[01:02:38.241 --> 01:02:39.202]  They just don't know that.
[01:02:39.262 --> 01:02:43.325]  They've been sold that if they'll just support nuking everyone, they're going to get rich.
[01:02:43.605 --> 01:02:44.526]  That's not how it works.
[01:02:44.986 --> 01:02:45.227]  Right.
[01:02:45.267 --> 01:02:51.351]  And basically just the understanding is we're just one major event away from full-scale martial law in our country anyway, whatever that event may be.
[01:02:51.672 --> 01:02:52.552]  They've been saying it.
[01:02:52.612 --> 01:02:53.773]  That's the point.
[01:02:54.214 --> 01:02:55.395]  It's not us saying this.
[01:02:55.635 --> 01:02:57.416]  We were saying this 10-15 years ago.
[01:02:57.917 --> 01:02:58.857]  We were the kooks.
[01:02:59.017 --> 01:03:01.179]  Now the talking heads are out there saying it.
[01:03:01.619 --> 01:03:03.461]  But they're putting a good spin on it.
[01:03:04.718 --> 01:03:14.684]  And also, I've heard in the past, and maybe you can verify this also, really to be honest, if the economy gets serious enough or in bad enough condition, that can be considered a condition to put us into martial law as well.
[01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:16.365]  That is under PDD 51.
[01:03:16.825 --> 01:03:17.586]  Right, okay.
[01:03:17.626 --> 01:03:23.029]  It says any economic problem anywhere in the world, the Congress is over.
[01:03:23.409 --> 01:03:24.450]  Bush runs everything.
[01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:27.972]  And then he signs an order saying, and I'm under UN.
[01:03:29.913 --> 01:03:30.413]  It happened!
[01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:31.094]  It's happening!
[01:03:31.314 --> 01:03:33.535]  We're now living the unbelievable!
[01:03:34.565 --> 01:03:36.326]  We're now living the unspeakable.
[01:03:37.046 --> 01:03:37.627]  It's happening.
[01:03:37.907 --> 01:03:39.328]  And not with a bang, with a whimper.
[01:03:39.668 --> 01:03:40.989]  Okay, we're under you in control.
[01:03:41.229 --> 01:03:41.809]  C'est la vie.
[01:03:42.509 --> 01:03:44.030]  You know, it's just, that's conservative.
[01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:44.430]  I'm for it.
[01:03:53.331 --> 01:03:58.413]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:03:58.473 --> 01:04:05.795]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:04:05.935 --> 01:04:16.598]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:04:16.779 --> 01:04:21.320]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:26.583]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:04:26.803 --> 01:04:29.745]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:04:29.965 --> 01:04:39.770]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:05:10.481 --> 01:05:17.524]  TerrorStorm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.944 --> 01:05:29.349]  TerrorStorm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.669 --> 01:05:33.171]  TerrorStorm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.631 --> 01:05:35.592]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.892 --> 01:05:39.674]  TerrorStorm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:59.045 --> 01:06:02.886]  The colon is a natural breeding ground for disease-producing germs.
[01:06:03.146 --> 01:06:07.287]  It may not sound like a very appealing subject, but it should not go ignored.
[01:06:07.427 --> 01:06:14.650]  For over a decade now, natural health expert Dr. Lauren Ritter has educated people everywhere about the benefits of internal cleansing.
[01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:18.691]  Now these benefits include higher energy levels, more comfortable digestion,

[01:06:53.285 --> 01:06:58.348]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.708 --> 01:07:01.009]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:01.329 --> 01:07:06.792]  Mike Rivera, WhatReallyHappened.com, joining us in about five minutes.
[01:07:06.852 --> 01:07:10.554]  We're going to get into the war news, the economy news.
[01:07:10.614 --> 01:07:11.375]  He's one of the
[01:07:19.023 --> 01:07:24.005]  Best red experts out there and that's why I'm glad that he's scheduled once a month to be joining us.
[01:07:24.065 --> 01:07:26.326]  And today is perfect time with so much happening.
[01:07:26.727 --> 01:07:28.507]  Richard in Texas and Derek and others.
[01:07:28.567 --> 01:07:29.308]  Richard, you're on the air.
[01:07:29.328 --> 01:07:29.888]  Thanks for holding.
[01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:32.609]  Come on out, sir.
[01:07:32.629 --> 01:07:34.810]  Hey, sorry I didn't mean to cut you off.
[01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:35.491]  How's it going, man?
[01:07:35.671 --> 01:07:35.871]  Good.
[01:07:35.991 --> 01:07:36.231]  Go ahead.
[01:07:37.781 --> 01:07:42.622]  Well, I got a little bullet list of a couple of vague topics to touch.
[01:07:43.562 --> 01:07:45.683]  I'm fresh from the Straw Poll.
[01:07:45.983 --> 01:07:48.703]  I work overnight, so I haven't had a chance to catch your show.
[01:07:48.743 --> 01:07:55.485]  I saw you had an article up on the Texas Straw Poll up there, but I didn't know if you had a chance to get anybody on the program yet.
[01:07:55.945 --> 01:07:59.086]  Well, specifically, how they kept people out?
[01:08:00.426 --> 01:08:00.746]  Pardon?
[01:08:01.366 --> 01:08:02.326]  Just hold on just a minute.
[01:08:02.606 --> 01:08:05.927]  It sounded like you were asking me a question, is what that sounded like.
[01:08:06.724 --> 01:08:16.851]  Well, I didn't know if you had a chance to have anybody on yet that had actually been at the Straw Poll to report on the numbers that were actually there and what the media coverage was like or anything like that.
[01:08:17.691 --> 01:08:18.312]  No, I haven't.
[01:08:18.332 --> 01:08:19.913]  Why don't you tell us?
[01:08:20.873 --> 01:08:24.536]  Well, I was there for the whole weekend.
[01:08:25.296 --> 01:08:27.918]  Everybody was very civil throughout the entire thing.
[01:08:27.938 --> 01:08:32.361]  Ron Paul actually managed to raise $102,000 that weekend.
[01:08:35.225 --> 01:08:37.628]  at the campaign, which is a big number for him.
[01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:47.619]  Awesome, it's moving forward on a lighter note because I know this is the culmination right now time as far as a lot of really dreary news, at least Ron Paul's coming through.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:54.046]  Bummer that he took third place, but this is the part where I get wary.
[01:08:55.529 --> 01:08:57.370]  Texas is obviously his state.
[01:08:57.790 --> 01:09:00.812]  Yeah, he won states like Alabama and New Hampshire.
[01:09:01.192 --> 01:09:04.273]  Why would he come in third place with 17% of the vote?
[01:09:04.293 --> 01:09:07.715]  And then we have the video of the Ron Paul printout saying, be there at 10 a.m.
[01:09:08.055 --> 01:09:13.618]  for registration and then turning away masses of Ron Paul supporters who were delegates.
[01:09:14.438 --> 01:09:18.680]  Yeah, it was pretty nasty.
[01:09:20.831 --> 01:09:22.852]  There was a lot of positive movement there.
[01:09:22.972 --> 01:09:27.054]  I don't know if you had been explained to how the registration actually worked.
[01:09:27.375 --> 01:09:29.256]  Well, you know, that's kind of ancient history now.
[01:09:29.276 --> 01:09:30.957]  We got them about to start World War III.
[01:09:31.297 --> 01:09:37.660]  So my big issue is it looks like they kept Ron Paul delegates out and that just sounds like par for the course for me.
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:40.342]  I've only seen a five minute YouTube video.
[01:09:40.362 --> 01:09:41.903]  Can you fill me in real fast?
[01:09:42.763 --> 01:09:45.505]  Alright, well basically how it worked at the poll was
[01:09:46.636 --> 01:09:50.818]  Delegates were obviously the only ones that were allowed to cast votes this time around.
[01:09:50.838 --> 01:09:52.119]  You had to pay to get in.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:10:07.148]  They were allowed to bring two guests into the actual polling area during the straw poll, which left a pretty clear way to gauge just how many supporters were there by the ratio.
[01:10:08.489 --> 01:10:12.551]  So I was lucky enough to get inside with one of the delegates.
[01:10:13.274 --> 01:10:22.358]  And I would say about at least conservatively 90% of the people at the actual straw poll inside the building were all Ron Paul supporters.
[01:10:22.578 --> 01:10:24.479]  It was a mass of Ron Paul supporters.
[01:10:24.759 --> 01:10:26.320]  I'll tell you what, write it up in an email.
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:28.321]  We'll post it on jonesreport.com.
[01:10:28.361 --> 01:10:29.861]  Richard, I really appreciate your call.
[01:10:31.302 --> 01:10:34.624]  It's very interesting and I have no doubt that Ron Paul was cheated.
[01:10:35.104 --> 01:10:42.067]  The fact that he won in New Hampshire where they had a very transparent straw poll, that makes sense that he'd win.
[01:10:43.021 --> 01:10:44.042]  I was there Saturday morning also.
[01:11:02.988 --> 01:11:11.914]  One interesting thing to note is that after that bus of Ron Paul people from San Antonio were rejected, there was another bus that came in for another candidate, and somehow they let them in.
[01:11:12.294 --> 01:11:15.276]  Yeah, I've gotten those reports, and it looks very, very suspicious.
[01:11:15.296 --> 01:11:17.798]  I have the videos up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:11:17.858 --> 01:11:22.341]  Thanks to the great folks on the message board there on the Prison Planet forum.
[01:11:23.161 --> 01:11:23.922]  All these great tips.
[01:11:23.982 --> 01:11:27.544]  I did learn about that, I guess it was Sunday morning.
[01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:30.746]  It looks like everything else we see.
[01:11:33.208 --> 01:11:35.229]  Well, as the previous guy said, he's right.
[01:11:35.269 --> 01:11:38.110]  There was about 90% Ron Paul support in there.
[01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:40.290]  People think they're a bunch of hippies or whatever.
[01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:41.611]  They're young guys in suits.
[01:11:41.651 --> 01:11:43.372]  They were wearing Ron Paul on their sleeves.
[01:11:43.392 --> 01:11:44.452]  They were being very polite.
[01:11:44.472 --> 01:11:47.493]  A lot of really intelligent, well-spoken, good-looking women.
[01:11:47.533 --> 01:11:50.734]  A good departure from the Miss Teen USA situation.
[01:11:51.374 --> 01:11:51.894]  Exactly.
[01:11:51.934 --> 01:11:55.936]  But one thing I want to narrow in on is after Ron Paul spoke,
[01:11:57.037 --> 01:12:03.281]  I believe Hugh Court, who's basically nobody, but he's a big war drumming neocon psychologist.
[01:12:03.781 --> 01:12:07.083]  He was really warmongering the terrorists, Al-Qaeda, bin Laden.
[01:12:07.123 --> 01:12:13.347]  Yeah, they've gotten their order and suddenly you see bin Laden all over TV, the talking points have been issued, the war is on, folks.
[01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:24.453]  Yeah, and then the icing on the cake was the last speaker who was a retired and disabled Lieutenant Colonel in the Army, and he was in the Pentagon the day of the attack.
[01:12:24.893 --> 01:12:34.897]  And they showed, like in loose change, a superimposed Boeing 757 right in front of the Pentagon, but they also showed the Pentagon after the fact, you know, before it collapsed.
[01:12:35.290 --> 01:12:43.694]  And they were trying to get everyone in there to believe, and everyone in there... I mean, half the people in there were believing that this plane had no wing damage to the building.
[01:12:43.774 --> 01:12:46.675]  I mean, there were still columns... Wait a minute, let me stop you, let me stop you.
[01:12:46.715 --> 01:12:57.920]  You're saying, at a Republican Party function, for Texas delegates, at a straw poll, they took time out to run an anti-911 truth, little propaganda corps junket?
[01:12:58.507 --> 01:12:59.048]  Yes, sir.
[01:12:59.188 --> 01:13:01.790]  And it was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Army that was telling us this.
[01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:05.794]  And then, what was... Well, let me just stop you again, because that doesn't fully answer my question.
[01:13:06.114 --> 01:13:12.440]  They specifically attacked 9-11 Truth and said, we're showing this to dispel everything.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.423]  Specifically, is that the case, A?
[01:13:15.543 --> 01:13:16.303]  B, what's his name?
[01:13:16.884 --> 01:13:19.727]  Yes, that is the case, A. And B, I don't know.
[01:13:19.787 --> 01:13:21.308]  I've been searching on him on the Internet.
[01:13:21.348 --> 01:13:21.768]  I'm at work.
[01:13:21.808 --> 01:13:22.950]  I really don't have time to do that.
[01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:23.370]  What's his name?
[01:13:24.778 --> 01:13:25.479]  I don't know his name.
[01:13:25.539 --> 01:13:28.720]  He was a Lieutenant Colonel with the Army and he was injured in the Pentagon.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:33.403]  But I wanted to stand up and scream and tell people, hey, look at the columns, look at the brick façade.
[01:13:33.463 --> 01:13:34.683]  Where is the wing damage?
[01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:35.844]  It's not there, you fools.
[01:13:35.864 --> 01:13:36.944]  There's a 20-foot hole.
[01:13:37.244 --> 01:13:38.605]  Well, listen, listen, listen.
[01:13:38.625 --> 01:13:39.245]  Here's the deal.
[01:13:39.426 --> 01:13:44.228]  None of this is going to affect the enemy or have any effect on them unless you put it in written word, and I appreciate your call.
[01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:58.736]  Everybody chomping at the bit to talk about the Ron Paul Straw Poll needs to send well-written, with no profanity, emails of what happened from your point of view and your name to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:13:58.776 --> 01:13:59.296]  Two A's.
[01:14:01.077 --> 01:14:02.438]  Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:14:02.558 --> 01:14:04.539]  Aaron, you've got two hours, folks.
[01:14:04.559 --> 01:14:11.643]  Just write it up in three or four paragraphs and we'll put a compilation with, you know, Bill Johnson from Lubbock saw this.
[01:14:12.751 --> 01:14:25.874]  Tim Thompson from Dallas saw this, Billy Bob Carroll saw this, and serious questions about Ron Paul's straw poll, anti-911 truth propaganda.
[01:14:28.514 --> 01:14:36.956]  Riding up, seeing the other bus arrive, and them letting in supporters of other Republicans, and then not letting in the Ron Paul delegates.
[01:14:38.183 --> 01:14:39.944]  Which we have video, we'll post that with it.
[01:14:40.444 --> 01:14:42.004]  That is very newsworthy right there.
[01:14:42.364 --> 01:14:47.446]  The fact that they've got the Pentagon running around trying to teach everybody that a plane really hit the Pentagon is very interesting.
[01:14:48.486 --> 01:14:51.247]  It's not just interesting that they're trying to prove that a plane hit the Pentagon.
[01:14:51.427 --> 01:14:58.249]  I've always said that I believe that they've made a big deal out of this so that they can later bring out a video of a plane actually hitting.
[01:14:59.169 --> 01:15:04.251]  I'm on record saying that in Terror Storm, first and second edition.
[01:15:05.311 --> 01:15:06.512]  I'm not debating what hit it.
[01:15:06.612 --> 01:15:07.672]  I'm not going to get into that
[01:15:08.343 --> 01:15:15.513]  By the way, when the History Channel was here in town, day after day, they would say, will you please talk about the Pentagon.
[01:15:16.074 --> 01:15:17.316]  That's another thing they did that was lying.
[01:15:17.336 --> 01:15:21.862]  And I said, now I'll talk about it, but I want to preface that I'm not getting into the debate.
[01:15:22.481 --> 01:15:25.482]  That I'm not saying I know, could have been a plane, couldn't have been a plane.
[01:15:25.922 --> 01:15:31.665]  I go, the media only wants to focus on that, and I believe that's because it's a tar baby.
[01:15:32.805 --> 01:15:34.326]  It's a football issue.
[01:15:34.446 --> 01:15:35.946]  I want to talk about controlled demolition.
[01:15:35.966 --> 01:15:38.007]  I want to talk about hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:15:38.047 --> 01:15:38.868]  military bases.
[01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:47.351]  I want to talk about Nick Berg having his head sawed off and giving a laptop to one of the hijackers at a secret operation in Norman, Oklahoma, mainstream news.
[01:15:47.951 --> 01:15:52.752]  I want to talk about $100,000 to Mohammad Atta from the head of Pakistani Intelligence.
[01:15:53.072 --> 01:15:57.253]  I want to talk about him meeting on September 11th with the heads of the House and Senate Intelligence Committee.
[01:15:58.414 --> 01:16:08.316]  And I said, you only use this, and I remember doing it over and over again as he kept bringing it up, I want to make clear that I don't know what happened there and I don't believe it's the strongest issue.
[01:16:09.196 --> 01:16:16.198]  They had me in that show, folks, with quick edits, going, no plane hit the Pentagon, this is the big issue,
[01:16:18.448 --> 01:16:23.433]  Again, they want to fight us, and you've got to ask, why do they want to have the fight on this issue?
[01:16:23.773 --> 01:16:27.757]  Why do they want to engage us on the field on this issue?
[01:16:27.997 --> 01:16:29.178]  Why do they want to fight us here?
[01:16:29.478 --> 01:16:35.764]  I want to fight the enemy on my terms, when I've got the high ground, when I've got the initiative, when I've got the evidence.
[01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:37.786]  It's very suspicious.
[01:16:38.803 --> 01:16:41.365]  But it is newsworthy that they're now going around doing this.
[01:16:41.405 --> 01:16:42.947]  So send them, we'll get them posted.
[01:16:43.227 --> 01:16:46.510]  You know, I can have Mike Rivera on for 10 hours, and I want to go to your calls.
[01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:48.211]  And we'll get to your calls later in the show with him.
[01:16:49.032 --> 01:16:53.476]  And who knows, I might even keep him on with the DC Madam in the next hour, because he's done a lot on this case.
[01:16:54.377 --> 01:16:55.558]  And if he's got the time, I'll do it.
[01:16:56.118 --> 01:16:57.720]  But I don't like having him hold five minutes.
[01:16:58.689 --> 01:16:59.890]  But there's just so much happening.
[01:17:00.431 --> 01:17:03.873]  Mike, we've got them gearing up for war, ordering the PR teams to go red.
[01:17:03.893 --> 01:17:06.075]  We've got the economy situation.
[01:17:06.115 --> 01:17:08.677]  We've got all this other news I want to go over.
[01:17:08.758 --> 01:17:10.359]  The push for national health care.
[01:17:10.859 --> 01:17:12.100]  Forced doctor visits.
[01:17:12.401 --> 01:17:13.522]  I want to talk about it all with you.
[01:17:13.722 --> 01:17:16.604]  But on the case of the Pentagon, do you concur with what I just said?
[01:17:16.624 --> 01:17:18.706]  Oh, I absolutely agree.
[01:17:18.726 --> 01:17:25.372]  This whole idea that it was not a passenger jet at the Pentagon is a deliberately planted trap to get people to fall into.
[01:17:25.412 --> 01:17:26.212]  And I agree.
[01:17:26.252 --> 01:17:26.973]  At some point,
[01:17:27.721 --> 01:17:40.654]  And they may have missed the opportunity by waiting too long, but I think the original plan was they were going to get the Whole Truth Movement to sign on to the no-plane hoax, and then come out with a video that absolutely showed the plane hitting the building, so they could ridicule us.
[01:17:40.694 --> 01:17:42.877]  And this is called poisoning wellness.
[01:17:42.937 --> 01:17:44.158]  Nothing new about this tactic.
[01:17:44.571 --> 01:17:48.294]  They did it back during the JFK assassination with the Umbrella Man.
[01:17:49.274 --> 01:17:59.962]  They did it, they destroyed Jim Garrison's case against Clay Shaw with the witness who waited until he was on the stand to start talking about fingerprinting his own daughter to make sure it was really her every night.
[01:17:59.982 --> 01:18:03.224]  And this kind of stuff, you know, goes on all the time.
[01:18:03.264 --> 01:18:14.012]  Back during the Clinton administration when they were holding the congressional hearings into the abuses of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, they had one very obvious plant show up wearing full military camo
[01:18:14.471 --> 01:18:21.676]  And then screaming about the government was concealing its tornado-making machine that they were using to target dissident farmers in the Midwest.
[01:18:22.137 --> 01:18:34.566]  And this kind of game-playing goes on, have gone on, and it's one of the ways in which the people who are running the propaganda machine in the United States are still playing by the rules that worked back in the 50s and 60s at the height of the Cold War.
[01:18:34.586 --> 01:18:35.407]  Mike, stay there!
[01:18:35.647 --> 01:18:36.888]  I agree with you!
[01:18:37.364 --> 01:18:38.966]  Now, I think the Pentagon should be looked at.
[01:18:38.986 --> 01:18:40.207]  There's a lot of suspicious things.
[01:18:40.247 --> 01:18:41.449]  My point is, I'm neutral.
[01:18:42.090 --> 01:18:47.636]  I said on the show, the people ask questions because of this, and they misrepresented me.
[01:18:47.936 --> 01:18:48.857]  A point I've never even made.
[01:18:48.877 --> 01:18:49.638]  There's so many lies.
[01:18:49.678 --> 01:18:50.319]  How do you make them all?
[01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:51.100]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.422 --> 01:18:56.445]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:18:56.765 --> 01:19:01.689]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:06.293]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:19:06.594 --> 01:19:15.521]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:19:15.722 --> 01:19:19.345]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:19:19.625 --> 01:19:24.654]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:19:24.934 --> 01:19:31.646]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:19:32.156 --> 01:19:32.797]  What about you?
[01:19:33.457 --> 01:19:38.802]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:19:54.022 --> 01:19:54.222]  $10 for Midas.
[01:19:54.242 --> 01:19:54.483]  August 31st, 2007.
[01:19:54.583 --> 01:19:54.863]  Gold is at $6.73.
[01:19:54.903 --> 01:19:56.045]  50 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $6.95.
[01:19:56.105 --> 01:19:56.045]  $13.00.
[01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:56.445]  $3.42.
[01:19:56.145 --> 01:19:56.445]  $9.95 for half.
[01:19:56.465 --> 01:19:56.445]  $1.70.
[01:19:56.485 --> 01:19:56.866]  $1.48 for quarter.
[01:19:56.906 --> 01:19:57.166]  That's $6.95.
[01:19:57.206 --> 01:19:57.166]  $13.00.
[01:19:57.226 --> 01:19:57.166]  $3.42.
[01:19:57.246 --> 01:19:57.327]  $9.95.
[01:19:57.267 --> 01:19:57.327]  And $1.70. $1.48.
[01:20:08.922 --> 01:20:11.543]  Hedge funds caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[01:20:11.583 --> 01:20:13.343]  The bond market continues to slump.
[01:20:13.523 --> 01:20:13.823]  J.P.
[01:20:13.863 --> 01:20:16.764]  Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[01:20:16.804 --> 01:20:18.984]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[01:20:19.044 --> 01:20:23.785]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[01:20:23.865 --> 01:20:26.246]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[01:20:26.346 --> 01:20:30.667]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders is skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[01:20:31.007 --> 01:20:31.427]  The U.S.
[01:20:31.447 --> 01:20:35.748]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[01:20:35.828 --> 01:20:37.548]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[01:20:37.988 --> 01:20:40.692]  Economist Rudy Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[01:20:40.952 --> 01:20:42.134]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:47.721]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:48.021]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:48.061 --> 01:20:48.241]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.476 --> 01:20:57.760]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.845]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:21:03.105 --> 01:21:04.446]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:21:04.606 --> 01:21:08.150]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calvin Pure Soaps?
[01:21:08.210 --> 01:21:13.374]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[01:21:13.635 --> 01:21:19.400]  Marty Schachter founded Calvin's Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:22.141]  Now, Calbin Soaps are available to you and me.
[01:21:22.241 --> 01:21:24.561]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.

[01:21:28.382 --> 01:21:29.322]  No animal testing.
[01:21:29.582 --> 01:21:30.883]  I use them and love them.
[01:21:30.903 --> 01:21:32.523]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[01:21:32.803 --> 01:21:33.903]  And I save big time.
[01:21:34.203 --> 01:21:35.804]  Call Calbin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:36.264]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[01:21:45.666 --> 01:21:52.152]  Again, that number 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[01:21:53.413 --> 01:21:55.795]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[01:21:56.335 --> 01:21:57.797]  After a pedicure they look great.
[01:21:58.157 --> 01:22:01.980]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[01:22:02.441 --> 01:22:04.623]  Haven't you heard about Cal-X ointment?
[01:22:05.043 --> 01:22:08.386]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:22:08.786 --> 01:22:11.249]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:22:11.749 --> 01:22:12.750]  What's that name again?
[01:22:13.191 --> 01:22:14.352]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:22:14.753 --> 01:22:15.914]  It's Calex.
[01:22:16.335 --> 01:22:18.177]  C-A-L-E-X.
[01:22:18.518 --> 01:22:20.360]  What makes Calex Oytman so different?
[01:22:21.132 --> 01:22:29.754]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:22:30.194 --> 01:22:35.916]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:22:36.296 --> 01:22:47.419]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Phyllo, Card Drug, HEV grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:22:48.078 --> 01:22:49.179]  Hey, here's a drugstore.
[01:22:49.499 --> 01:22:50.180]  I'll be right back.
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:52.061]  I'm getting some callots for my heels.
[01:23:06.392 --> 01:23:13.057]  I don't agree with the big government liberal support policies of the New Yorker magazine.
[01:23:14.698 --> 01:23:15.639]  With that said,
[01:23:16.864 --> 01:23:18.846]  It really is a publication of record.
[01:23:21.648 --> 01:23:30.535]  I have seen stories in there where the DeBeer family, the Oppenheimers who run DeBeers, admit that they run a monopoly and kill people that try to break into the diamond trade.
[01:23:31.675 --> 01:23:36.339]  I've seen articles where they admit they were only going to go to war in 2003, not 2002.
[01:23:36.999 --> 01:23:38.841]  I've seen stories where they admit U.S.
[01:23:38.861 --> 01:23:39.962]  Special Forces are in,
[01:23:42.308 --> 01:23:45.489]  Iraq, Iran already carrying out ops before the wars even start.
[01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:50.071]  The point is it's accurate and it fits with what I already know and other information we have.
[01:23:50.111 --> 01:23:59.555]  And they're reporting, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com, that Cheney has ordered the media to sell ATT&CK on Iran and that they're now in the final phases of gearing up for it in the next few months.
[01:24:00.496 --> 01:24:02.557]  But right now they admit they don't have the support.
[01:24:03.857 --> 01:24:09.840]  Mike Rivero, in the four minutes we've got in this short segment, walked through, there have been so many preparations made
[01:24:10.735 --> 01:24:15.576]  Talk about the preparations and what you think is going to happen and what this new ominous report means.
[01:24:16.977 --> 01:24:27.400]  Well, obviously, it's effectively an admission that they don't have the support, that they're trying to find some way to rally it, and they're failing to get any traction on moving public support forward.
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:35.022]  And of course, a lot of that is the result that we all know about the lies that were used to start the war in Iraq and are still being told to try and perpetuate it.
[01:24:36.056 --> 01:24:41.478]  And they're just trying to find a way that they can, as Bush used to put it, catapult the propaganda forward.
[01:24:42.298 --> 01:24:56.621]  I feel that they're kind of backed into a corner, and I know there's a lot of people writing on the net right now, that the likelihood of a new false flag staged terror event seems very real right now, and it's kind of hard to dismiss that.
[01:24:56.661 --> 01:24:59.422]  It does seem the very likely kind of thing to do.
[01:24:59.502 --> 01:25:02.163]  I mean, what we have is President Bush
[01:25:02.662 --> 01:25:06.185]  Who is facing an historical failure in Iraq.
[01:25:06.565 --> 01:25:11.089]  He's desperate to do something positive that can be the legacy of his presidency.
[01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:15.173]  And I think he sees that as a good reason to go into Iran.
[01:25:15.666 --> 01:25:19.428]  Plus, he's got the pressure coming from Israel to go into Iran and the neocons.
[01:25:19.728 --> 01:25:23.890]  Plus, he's got a deteriorating economy that he needs to distract the American people from.
[01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:29.773]  And our nation does, unfortunately, have a history of starting a major war to get out of its economic difficulties.
[01:25:30.534 --> 01:25:34.776]  And so, there's a lot of pressure right now to find some way, anyway, to kick off a war
[01:25:35.456 --> 01:26:04.302]  into Iran and I think they're going to try and at least do the initial attack almost entirely from the air where they're going to go in with bombers and missiles overtly to attack the the Iranian Republican Guard that they're getting ready to declare a terrorist organization and at the same time they'll probably go after Iran's nuclear fuel facilities and my assumption is that they will probably use tactical nuclear bunker busters and then blame the resulting radiation
[01:26:04.807 --> 01:26:08.950]  As proof that they were building weapons down in that now smashed cavern.
[01:26:09.570 --> 01:26:11.312]  But yeah, it's definitely on.
[01:26:11.352 --> 01:26:14.314]  They're just looking for a way that they can get the American people to sit still for it.
[01:26:14.774 --> 01:26:19.457]  Now, Mike, you dovetail that with the month-long hype that Al-Qaeda is about to hit us.
[01:26:20.058 --> 01:26:21.999]  All the classic Al-Qaeda videos come out.
[01:26:22.059 --> 01:26:23.460]  Turns out the intel center is...
[01:26:24.386 --> 01:26:25.066]  Doctoring them.
[01:26:25.726 --> 01:26:27.607]  Top computer experts have looked at that.
[01:26:28.407 --> 01:26:31.027]  Meshing with all the let's attack them propaganda.
[01:26:31.467 --> 01:26:36.769]  Do you think that they'll stage some type of event as a prep for that or just go into Iran?
[01:26:38.089 --> 01:26:41.009]  I'm sure that right now that is being debated.
[01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:48.031]  I'm sure there's at least one faction in the government that says we can't get away with another false flag attack because look how miserably 9-11 has failed.
[01:26:49.427 --> 01:26:57.470]  MSNBC ran a poll just the other day where 65% of Americans said they don't believe the official story that the government has put out about 9-11.
[01:26:57.550 --> 01:27:02.112]  I noticed they're running Flight 93 all over the various cable channels right now.
[01:27:03.543 --> 01:27:08.808]  Then there's the other group that says, well, we got away with it once, we can get away with it again, and without it we can't get going.
[01:27:08.848 --> 01:27:12.852]  So I'm sure there's a lot of arguments going on inside the corridors of power.
[01:27:13.052 --> 01:27:20.379]  Well, it's just like this colonel at the Republican straw polls having a presentation against 9-11 Truth.
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:23.162]  I mean, that shows how much it's hurting them if they're doing that.
[01:27:24.174 --> 01:27:25.115]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:27:25.175 --> 01:27:30.037]  They're reacting to us, as you were saying in your little commentary.
[01:27:30.317 --> 01:27:31.378]  We have the initiative.
[01:27:31.458 --> 01:27:32.518]  We have the high ground.
[01:27:32.939 --> 01:27:34.579]  They're having to respond to us.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:37.741]  The numbers that MSNBC came up with basically shows.
[01:27:38.038 --> 01:27:41.381]  The mainstream media has lost control of the minds of America.
[01:27:41.461 --> 01:27:45.705]  We have a free-thinking population right now, and that is absolutely scaring.
[01:27:45.765 --> 01:27:54.473]  And by the way, that's never happened before, but it's a bunch of old globalists who are running things, and they're so used to winning, I think it's going to be a collision, Mike.
[01:27:55.581 --> 01:27:56.763]  I absolutely agree.
[01:27:56.863 --> 01:28:04.192]  I'm sure there's a lot of denial going on, especially in those higher levels where they've got all their aides insulating them from what's really going on out here.
[01:28:04.572 --> 01:28:13.122]  They're probably not aware of this idea that 65% or in some cases 80% of Americans believe the United States government has lied about 9-11.
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:17.141]  It was such a bold move.
[01:28:17.181 --> 01:28:21.063]  I mean, they probably wouldn't have gotten away with 9-11 and 63 without the Internet.
[01:28:21.143 --> 01:28:24.385]  I mean, now they're not going to get away with it, at least in the court of public opinion.
[01:28:24.425 --> 01:28:31.690]  I mean, they can still have their experts set up on TV and put out the official story, but if nobody believes them, where do we go from there?
[01:28:31.730 --> 01:28:35.912]  Let's come back and continue with the war news, the economy, cloning.
[01:28:36.073 --> 01:28:36.713]  Your call.
[01:28:36.773 --> 01:28:37.273]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.886 --> 01:28:44.806]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.286 --> 01:28:46.887]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.807 --> 01:28:50.568]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.809 --> 01:28:57.390]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[01:28:57.630 --> 01:28:58.510]  Look no further!
[01:28:58.810 --> 01:29:01.371]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[01:29:01.811 --> 01:29:10.233]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[01:29:10.333 --> 01:29:10.593]  I think.
[01:29:28.078 --> 01:29:28.919]  We're good to go.
[01:29:53.903 --> 01:29:55.763]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:29:55.883 --> 01:30:01.085]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:30:01.245 --> 01:30:02.585]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:30:02.865 --> 01:30:11.027]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:30:11.247 --> 01:30:16.988]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:30:17.288 --> 01:30:17.588]  I think so.
[01:30:37.222 --> 01:30:37.802]  We're good.
[01:30:54.471 --> 01:31:01.256]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two book set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[01:31:01.616 --> 01:31:08.021]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[01:31:08.502 --> 01:31:18.409]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[01:31:18.889 --> 01:31:22.352]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[01:31:22.652 --> 01:31:25.334]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[01:31:25.955 --> 01:31:28.657]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.
[01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:33.500]  Send your check for $32 post-pay to Radio Liberty P.O.

[01:32:13.886 --> 01:32:14.647]  Welcome back.
[01:32:14.687 --> 01:32:20.232]  Michael Rivero is our guest.
[01:32:20.272 --> 01:32:24.536]  Don't forget, tonight, tomorrow night,
[01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:45.451]  And Thursday night, I'm going to be showing my new film, Endgame.
[01:32:46.651 --> 01:32:49.011]  This is the full, finished film.
[01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:54.352]  It's a sneak peek, because the DVD won't be out until mid-October.
[01:32:57.513 --> 01:33:03.874]  And for some reason, the Alamo Draft House only allowed half their tickets to be sold online, because they were telling me it was sold out.
[01:33:03.894 --> 01:33:04.634]  And I said, what do you mean?
[01:33:04.654 --> 01:33:07.414]  You've only sold a hundred and something tickets for each showing.
[01:33:07.434 --> 01:33:09.995]  And they said, oh, we had the computer set this way.
[01:33:10.055 --> 01:33:10.955]  I said, unset it.
[01:33:11.525 --> 01:33:15.907]  We're 90% can be sold online.
[01:33:15.967 --> 01:33:17.248]  So tonight's is sold out.
[01:33:17.288 --> 01:33:18.728]  People went to the door and bought them already.
[01:33:19.069 --> 01:33:21.990]  But tomorrow's has, I don't know, 60 something seats left.
[01:33:23.190 --> 01:33:25.552]  And Thursday has about that many seats left as well.
[01:33:25.572 --> 01:33:27.132]  So if you wanted to go, I hope to see you there.
[01:33:27.472 --> 01:33:29.493]  I'll be speaking before each showing of the film.
[01:33:30.094 --> 01:33:32.875]  And then of course, taking questions at the end of it.
[01:33:33.644 --> 01:33:43.170]  If you want hard copies of Terror Storm, Final Cut, or any of the films I've made, or the books or videos we carry, don't forget the secure online video and bookstore shopping cart at InfoWars.com.

[01:34:16.972 --> 01:34:23.597]  The big thing about PrisonPlanet.tv is that it's in super high quality video compared to what you'll see out there on Google or YouTube.
[01:34:24.078 --> 01:34:31.283]  It's really high quality, and even if you have a dial-up, you can still download the films, it just takes longer, and then burn them to disk and give them to people.
[01:34:32.804 --> 01:34:40.130]  The Road to Tyranny, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, my Police State films, Terror Storm 1st Edition and 2nd Edition,
[01:34:40.954 --> 01:34:41.575]  It's all there.
[01:34:42.215 --> 01:34:46.719]  A TV show on a particular topic, a radio show we video with in-studio guests.
[01:34:46.899 --> 01:34:49.702]  You like the issue covered, burn it to disk, give it to people.
[01:34:49.782 --> 01:34:52.204]  It is a great way to resist the new world order.
[01:34:52.524 --> 01:34:53.765]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:54.606 --> 01:35:00.691]  Going back to Mike Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com, who joins us once a month from his home in Hawaii.
[01:35:01.652 --> 01:35:03.594]  Mike, the economy
[01:35:05.291 --> 01:35:11.799]  Two years ago Bilderberg Group said they wanted to pop the real estate bubble because it was a cash sink as you and I have covered many times.
[01:35:13.161 --> 01:35:14.702]  They want it to fall apart.
[01:35:15.362 --> 01:35:21.325]  The Times of London reported that they don't want a instant plunge, they want a slow decline of the dollar and of the U.S.
[01:35:21.365 --> 01:35:21.805]  economy.
[01:35:22.065 --> 01:35:37.932]  The only reason they're bailing us out, as you and I have written and many other top experts have now concurred, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, one of them, father of Reaganomics, that they're only trying to have a slight parachute, not enough to keep us from breaking our legs, but just enough to slow the descent so it's more orderly.
[01:35:38.592 --> 01:35:41.293]  And then you see stories like this out of the Financial Times of London,
[01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:45.243]  Credit crisis has hallmarks of classic bank run.
[01:35:45.563 --> 01:35:53.410]  The turmoil in the financial markets has all the characteristics of a classic bank run, one that is taking place outside the traditional banking sector.
[01:35:54.330 --> 01:36:03.398]  Axel Weber of the Moondust Bank President said this weekend, what we are seeing is basically what we see underlying all banking crises, said Mr. Weber.
[01:36:04.509 --> 01:36:08.633]  One of the most influential members of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank.
[01:36:08.974 --> 01:36:18.944]  Also one of the other top heads, he was in line to get Bernanke's job but didn't at a retreat of the Kansas City Federal Reserve in Aspen.
[01:36:19.745 --> 01:36:23.267]  Over the weekend said he thinks a very serious recession is going to happen.
[01:36:23.607 --> 01:36:27.869]  We have Paul Volcker, former head of the Federal Reserve, saying the same thing.
[01:36:28.129 --> 01:36:29.830]  But they're posing as the saviors.
[01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:31.931]  They're now positioning themselves.
[01:36:32.171 --> 01:36:33.731]  And I always said this would be the sign.
[01:36:34.152 --> 01:36:35.252]  Not hard to figure this out.
[01:36:35.472 --> 01:36:41.455]  Because I've studied past corrections, depressions, the Asian crisis of a few years ago.
[01:36:42.268 --> 01:36:43.128]  Seems like a few years ago.
[01:36:43.168 --> 01:36:44.389]  I guess that was seven, eight years ago.
[01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:54.153]  All of these things, they, in a preparatory phase, pose as the saviors beforehand when it's their very policies that have orchestrated this.
[01:36:54.533 --> 01:36:57.774]  I have several other articles saying, oh no, the economy's not getting better.
[01:36:58.034 --> 01:37:00.215]  Get ready for a big crash this September.
[01:37:00.435 --> 01:37:01.775]  This in major publications.
[01:37:02.196 --> 01:37:07.157]  Mike Rivero, do you think they're pushing, trying to get the slide to continue?
[01:37:07.478 --> 01:37:08.418]  Or what do you think's happening?
[01:37:09.436 --> 01:37:21.321]  Well, I think the case is that there are a lot of vested interests with competing agendas, and Harry Truman used to have this wonderful saying that even if you took all the economists in the world and laid them end-to-end, they'd still point in different directions.
[01:37:22.302 --> 01:37:30.205]  I know that there were a lot of people who wanted the real estate bubble to continue in this country, not only because obviously on paper it increased their wealth,
[01:37:30.686 --> 01:37:40.154]  But Bush and his administration were using it as a cash sink to soak up all the extra money that was being printed up to pay for the war.
[01:37:40.494 --> 01:37:46.939]  And the idea was that the Federal Reserve would print all this additional money, or they'd tally up these additional credits in these computer bank accounts.
[01:37:47.299 --> 01:37:51.182]  It would get spent on bullets and bombs and materials for our soldiers.
[01:37:51.923 --> 01:37:58.008]  And then it would get swept up by the booming mortgage industry and these higher home prices.
[01:37:58.368 --> 01:38:06.695]  So that while there was more money being put through the economy to pay for the war, it wasn't creating these inflationary pressures anywhere but the real estate market.
[01:38:07.195 --> 01:38:21.046]  By bursting the real estate market, or by allowing it to burst, now we have all this surplus cash floating around our society and continuing to be cranked out to pay for the war, and we are going to see it driving up prices because we have too much cash
[01:38:21.488 --> 01:38:27.072]  Chasing too few goods and services, and that is the classic formula for seeing prices continue to increase.
[01:38:27.512 --> 01:38:50.568]  Now, as far as foreign interests or outside interests, yeah, it seems like this cycle of boom-bust, boom-and-bust is almost like this gigantic heartbeat that pumps real wealth away from the common working class people and to the ultra-rich, because they're acquiring real estate, they're acquiring tangible assets, we're being left
[01:38:51.033 --> 01:38:58.455]  sitting holding this worthless paper notes that we have been told represents something of value when in point of fact it represents a unit of debt.
[01:38:59.536 --> 01:39:17.761]  So, yes, it is by design and if you go back and you study the crash of 1929 you will see that it was in fact deliberately engineered by some of the main money center banks both to basically again transfer the real assets into the hands of a powerful few
[01:39:18.317 --> 01:39:23.842]  And at the same time justify, basically force the government to abandon the last links to the gold standard.
[01:39:24.002 --> 01:39:37.974]  And Churchill was even there when he was just a member of parliament to be shown the power of the British controlled Federal Reserve in this country on the day that they crashed it and then reduced money supply after issuing all this credit so it was physically impossible to do that.
[01:39:38.374 --> 01:39:41.097]  This time, and we're getting good intel, this is not disinfo,
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:57.645]  From the last four meetings, now five, major fissures inside Bilderberg, where one group of the central bank said, we're going to put out the word to pop your bubble, so you can't continue to do this, as a way to actually put the brakes on the neocons.
[01:39:57.866 --> 01:40:06.468]  But then I see the change in France and Sarkozy coming forward, and then it looks like Bilderberg is actually more for attacking Iran than they are against.
[01:40:06.969 --> 01:40:07.889]  Where do you see that going?
[01:40:08.730 --> 01:40:13.612]  Yeah, again, like our own government, the Bilderberg Group appears to be badly factionalized.
[01:40:14.152 --> 01:40:17.874]  And, again, there are a lot of competing agendas.
[01:40:17.934 --> 01:40:23.236]  Everybody who is there, they're not there to swear loyalties to some grand unified purpose of world conquest.
[01:40:23.496 --> 01:40:25.877]  They're each there looking out for their own interests.
[01:40:26.577 --> 01:40:34.460]  And, you know, basically at these meetings they get together and say, well, you know, is it better for most of us if we do X or is it better for most of us if we do Y?
[01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:35.941]  And that's how these choices get made.
[01:40:37.294 --> 01:40:45.100]  And as far as, yeah, the change in France has really shifted a lot of balance because now all of a sudden France is very much gung-ho for war in Iran.
[01:40:45.581 --> 01:40:55.810]  But as far as the economy is concerned, you hit it right on the head that there is this game that large central banks will play and the World Bank has played it and the U.S.
[01:40:55.870 --> 01:40:58.592]  used to play it with American banks in Central and South America.
[01:40:59.099 --> 01:41:12.215]  Going back to the 60s and 70s, where you would lure or force people or a government to engage in these loans, and then you would actively work to make sure that they never had the money to pay it all off.
[01:41:12.953 --> 01:41:16.216]  And you wound up owning their property or owning their government.
[01:41:16.516 --> 01:41:30.066]  And this is a very common scam that gets done under the guise of developing a third world nation, where these organizations like the World Bank will go in and loan the government a huge amount of money to try and build up the country.
[01:41:30.607 --> 01:41:37.212]  And then after it gets built up, they arrange it so that the government can't get enough cash to pay off its loans.
[01:41:37.734 --> 01:41:48.404]  And then all of a sudden we start hearing this thing about privatization, where all these wonderful built-up infrastructure and assets and ports and everything have to be sold in order for the government to repay its loans.
[01:41:48.424 --> 01:41:51.367]  But that's not really privatization.
[01:41:51.407 --> 01:41:56.952]  That is global corporations that are bigger than most governments, with their own militaries, their own private mercenaries.
[01:41:57.632 --> 01:41:59.193]  And that brings me into another area.
[01:41:59.474 --> 01:42:07.320]  They're now announcing a billion-dollar contract alone for a multinational company to run NSA spying domestically.
[01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:10.903]  We see the farming out to these private attack dogs.
[01:42:11.263 --> 01:42:16.847]  I mean, that is the literal usurping of our sovereignty right there.
[01:42:17.888 --> 01:42:18.769]  Well, absolutely.
[01:42:18.809 --> 01:42:23.873]  Now we find out that Black Point is buying their own military jets, so it's going to be a private air force now.
[01:42:24.593 --> 01:42:26.655]  With bombs, with missiles, with fighter planes.
[01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:40.918]  So, yeah, we're seeing the main power projection shifting from civil governments to the corporate state, and I realize that this is seen by many as a sociological evolution from theocratic state to nation state to corporate state.
[01:42:42.839 --> 01:42:55.386]  Just as the nation state kept churches around for ritual and traditional purposes, I'm sure the corporate state will keep around civil governments for appearances, but the real power has shifted to the corporations,
[01:42:55.839 --> 01:43:02.589]  Who have absolutely no interest in their responsibilities to the civil population, but only to the bottom line of profit.
[01:43:02.809 --> 01:43:10.120]  Now let's be clear, they then finance a lot of the mainline slash Republican libertarians who, if it has the word,
[01:43:11.802 --> 01:43:14.445]  Free market on it or privatization, it must be good.
[01:43:14.785 --> 01:43:28.778]  It is not privatization to have Sintra of Spain come in and pay off the governor and the legislature and then have them hand over the already paid for roads to then rape us and then lie to the public and say the state's bankrupt when it's running giant surpluses.
[01:43:29.119 --> 01:43:33.203]  So even the word privatization as it is practiced is not privatization.
[01:43:33.303 --> 01:43:36.526]  It is simply the equivalent of hostile takeovers.
[01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.910]  It's a looting.
[01:43:38.551 --> 01:43:39.071]  It's looting.
[01:43:39.231 --> 01:43:42.712]  Our government is taking the assets that we, the people, already paid for.
[01:43:43.453 --> 01:43:48.535]  And they are selling them to foreign governments, to foreign corporations, in order to line their own pockets.
[01:43:48.895 --> 01:43:51.376]  And we're seeing all this huge amount of money.
[01:43:52.306 --> 01:44:02.910]  Uh, that is, uh, basically, you know, just vanishing into, uh, war corporations, or, uh, we're, we're hearing about all this money that was allocated for Katrina that nobody can account for.
[01:44:03.151 --> 01:44:08.573]  We're hearing about 2.3 trillion dollars that vanished into the Pentagon and was announced just one day before 9-11.
[01:44:09.613 --> 01:44:11.654]  This money's going into somebody's pocket somewhere.
[01:44:13.129 --> 01:44:18.673]  Let me ask you, Mike Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com, do you think they're going to hit Iran, A?
[01:44:19.114 --> 01:44:21.856]  B, when do you think the biggest window for that to happen will be?
[01:44:24.023 --> 01:44:30.346]  I don't think there's any question that Bush and his administration are being goaded to attack Iran.
[01:44:30.466 --> 01:44:48.154]  I'm seeing some foot-dragging starting to come from within that inner circle, and I think that that faction fight may be one of the reasons we're starting to see so many of Bush's aides sort of drop off and peel away because... And we're now seeing big neocons go to the New Yorker magazine and say, we don't want war with Iran because we love our families.
[01:44:48.194 --> 01:44:53.256]  I mean, they're realizing this could really turn into a real World War III situation.
[01:44:54.088 --> 01:44:55.049]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:44:55.350 --> 01:45:03.621]  If we go on conquering the Mideast oil at some point, we're going to find ourselves up against Russia and China, who also have a strategic interest in the Middle East.
[01:45:03.962 --> 01:45:08.428]  And these countries really do have nuclear weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them.
[01:45:09.048 --> 01:45:11.612]  And if we look at the way Dick Cheney was building his little
[01:45:11.949 --> 01:45:22.617]  Private bunker underneath the Vice President's mansion a few years back and you realize that they have been planning to take this country to the edge or possibly over the edge of a real nuclear war.
[01:45:22.637 --> 01:45:29.322]  Yeah, they've got heart problems, they're diseased, they're mentally ill, they're on power trips, and they're like Hitler, man, they like war.
[01:45:29.342 --> 01:45:32.865]  I mean, and they just are gonna go, they're probably gonna go ahead and do it, folks.
[01:45:34.066 --> 01:45:35.407]  I'm sure that they're gonna do it.
[01:45:35.487 --> 01:45:37.808]  All they're looking for is some way that they can sell it.
[01:45:38.849 --> 01:45:41.311]  And that's what the advertising campaign that is cranking up
[01:45:41.656 --> 01:45:42.656]  This week is all about.
[01:45:42.676 --> 01:45:51.980]  You've got Ari Fleischer and his group that have somehow come up with $15 million to go out there and produce and sell commercials in support of the war.
[01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:53.641]  And again, that's the Israel lobby.
[01:45:53.681 --> 01:45:54.381]  I've got Israel.
[01:45:55.241 --> 01:45:57.842]  71% in a major poll want war.
[01:45:58.342 --> 01:46:04.965]  And I mean, what Israeli in their right mind wants to attack Iran whenever Iran doesn't even have weapons, Pakistan does.
[01:46:05.285 --> 01:46:06.746]  Israel's got at least 400 weapons.
[01:46:06.786 --> 01:46:07.846]  Nobody's going to mess with them.
[01:46:09.086 --> 01:46:13.827]  Absolutely, but that poll that you were just talking about, 71% of Israelis want the U.S.
[01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:14.888]  to attack Iran.
[01:46:15.728 --> 01:46:19.869]  And there's an almost arrogant assumption that what Israel wants the U.S.
[01:46:19.909 --> 01:46:21.530]  to do is something that the U.S.
[01:46:21.550 --> 01:46:22.470]  will actually do.
[01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:29.112]  It's not stated explicitly, but if you read that poll, yeah, they're used to thinking in those terms of U.S.
[01:46:29.152 --> 01:46:30.472]  will do what Israel wants.
[01:46:31.232 --> 01:46:36.354]  And again, we have all of these dual citizens who are in key positions in the U.S.
[01:46:36.394 --> 01:46:36.754]  government,
[01:46:37.545 --> 01:46:51.036]  There was an article that came out the other day where basically all but one of this inner circle of Bush associates pushing for war on Iran are Jewish dual citizens loyal to Israel.
[01:46:51.416 --> 01:46:52.437]  But what's wrong with them?
[01:46:52.477 --> 01:46:55.399]  Don't they know that this is going to totally destroy the U.S.
[01:46:55.439 --> 01:46:55.960]  currency?
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:57.801]  The dollar is going to be further dumped?
[01:46:58.402 --> 01:47:02.625]  I mean, I see neocons saying, you know, this will hedge the dollar, this will, you know, help things.
[01:47:02.785 --> 01:47:06.048]  Most of the experts look at that and say, no, it's going to blow up in your face.
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:15.103]  Yeah, it absolutely will, but, you know, there's a lot of arrogance, and certainly in the case of those people who are more loyal to Israel than to the U.S., they don't care.
[01:47:15.483 --> 01:47:34.949]  If they fail and they crash the United States economy, they'll just find some other country that they will move into and say, okay, you are the people who are now going to go stomp on our enemies for us, and, you know, here's some campaign contributions, and we're going to buy some newspapers so that we can guarantee they always write favorable things about the government,
[01:47:35.313 --> 01:47:39.577]  And then in exchange, you will send your young people off to go stomp on our enemies in the Mideast.
[01:47:40.478 --> 01:47:43.962]  And we're seeing this pattern repeat over and over and over again.
[01:47:43.982 --> 01:47:45.223]  But there's got to be an end.
[01:47:45.243 --> 01:47:46.785]  1.2 trillion on the war so far.
[01:47:47.185 --> 01:47:49.087]  Hundreds of billions to attack Iran.
[01:47:51.209 --> 01:47:54.312]  Earlier you said the American people are getting wise, waking up, getting smart.
[01:47:54.332 --> 01:47:55.173]  And to a certain point,
[01:47:55.942 --> 01:48:14.170]  I agree, but you have one group getting even stupider, like, whereas one group of people is getting more informed, more hooked in, more aware of the big picture, then another mass of people are getting just wantonly dumb, like Miss USA South Carolina, you know, one-fifth of Americans can't find the U.S.
[01:48:14.231 --> 01:48:14.711]  on a map.
[01:48:15.631 --> 01:48:18.573]  I mean, that's just like most Americans think a Shiite is Al-Qaeda.
[01:48:18.833 --> 01:48:19.453]  I mean, they just
[01:48:21.388 --> 01:48:25.512]  I think it's going to be the dumb people in black uniforms and machine guns ruling over us.
[01:48:25.752 --> 01:48:32.018]  I think the New World Order answer is, we'll try to PR you, but if that doesn't work, we'll just put you in camps.
[01:48:32.318 --> 01:48:35.381]  But I don't see, if they do that, that's really going to tank the economy.
[01:48:36.282 --> 01:48:37.563]  Yeah, it absolutely will.
[01:48:37.924 --> 01:48:44.550]  And I don't think we're going to get to that stage, because I think, you know, especially with instantaneous communication and alternative radio and websites like ours,
[01:48:45.738 --> 01:49:04.275]  I think we're going to reach a point where even those people who are so strongly in denial about what's going on are going to have to confront what's going on and look at it, and especially with the bad lessons of Nazi Germany, because those Germans tried to stay loyal to the end, didn't want to stand up to Hitler, and they wound up with their country destroyed anyway.
[01:49:04.335 --> 01:49:09.320]  And so anybody who is watching what Bush is doing right now, I don't care if it's Miss South Carolina,
[01:49:09.690 --> 01:49:20.754]  You know, at some point they're going to have to say, we're going the same direction as Nazi Germany, and their country was destroyed no matter how loyal the people were to their leader, and so we've got to pick a different thing.
[01:49:21.034 --> 01:49:23.055]  Now, that being said, I want to back up here a little bit.
[01:49:23.375 --> 01:49:28.396]  I don't think that group of people who are still believing in the war is all that large.
[01:49:28.476 --> 01:49:29.957]  The media amplifies them.
[01:49:30.417 --> 01:49:33.698]  The media puts them out front so that you can see them, but it's only 15%.
[01:49:33.738 --> 01:49:35.579]  Yeah, that's not large enough to rule a nation.
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:42.647]  Yeah, they got black uniforms and submachine guns, it is.
[01:49:43.048 --> 01:49:44.492]  We'll be right back, Mike Rivera.
[01:49:44.532 --> 01:49:44.954]  Stay with us.
[01:49:56.642 --> 01:50:02.132]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.492 --> 01:50:10.145]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.822 --> 01:50:17.866]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.286 --> 01:50:29.712]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.012 --> 01:50:33.534]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.975 --> 01:50:35.896]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.236 --> 01:50:40.098]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:53.502 --> 01:51:56.004]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:51:56.204 --> 01:52:00.467]  Honeybees are now mysteriously vanishing at an astonishing pace across the entire country.
[01:52:00.627 --> 01:52:03.529]  Why is this urgent message about honeybees so desperately important?
[01:52:03.789 --> 01:52:04.729]  The answer is easy.
[01:52:04.869 --> 01:52:11.091]  You see, honey bees produce a unique compound, fed only to the queen, that makes her live six times longer than other bees in the hive.
[01:52:11.311 --> 01:52:15.352]  Some researchers now believe the compound may have miraculous effects on humans as well.
[01:52:15.532 --> 01:52:21.493]  The compound is called Royal Jelly, and is now available in an all-new, ultra-purified form called Jealousine Gold.
[01:52:21.653 --> 01:52:27.055]  The product has been designed for purity-conscious Americans who are concerned about contaminated royal jelly entering the U.S.
[01:52:27.095 --> 01:52:27.575]  from Asia.
[01:52:27.755 --> 01:52:32.076]  Solutions from Science is the only company authorized to sell Jealousine Gold in the U.S.

[01:53:08.678 --> 01:53:20.186]  Alright, Roman, George, Nate, John, others, we're going to get to you right now.
[01:53:20.227 --> 01:53:22.828]  There's 50 other issues Mike and I can talk about.
[01:53:24.690 --> 01:53:28.413]  Bottom line, we've never lived in more dangerous, more interesting, more dynamic times.
[01:53:30.574 --> 01:53:33.096]  And I think the elite have got one more war in them.
[01:53:33.416 --> 01:53:35.118]  They plan to fail forward into World War III.
[01:53:36.039 --> 01:53:38.920]  And I think this will finally completely blow all their credibility.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.960]  And, uh, Mike, do you concur with that statement?
[01:53:43.221 --> 01:53:44.101]  Uh, absolutely.
[01:53:44.121 --> 01:53:48.382]  Uh, you know, it's just, as I said before in the earlier thing, the war is on.
[01:53:48.602 --> 01:53:51.382]  They're just looking for a way that they can sell it to the American people.
[01:53:51.622 --> 01:53:59.124]  We're gonna see that advertising campaign crank up this week, uh, to just push it on us about, you know, uh, how desirable this is.
[01:53:59.564 --> 01:54:04.305]  And, you know, it's funny, I've been thinking about this movie called Hot Shots Part Deux, which is this comedy film
[01:54:04.750 --> 01:54:08.856]  And in the middle of all the carnage, they have this one guy standing with a machine gun there saying, War!
[01:54:09.056 --> 01:54:10.458]  It's fantastic!
[01:54:10.618 --> 01:54:17.968]  And I'm trying to find that clip to basically put out there because it's such a wonderful parody for the propaganda that we're seeing right now.
[01:54:17.988 --> 01:54:19.450]  Yeah, Charlie Sheen stars in that.
[01:54:20.342 --> 01:54:20.982]  Yes, he does.
[01:54:21.042 --> 01:54:22.443]  It's a very, very funny movie.
[01:54:22.763 --> 01:54:25.404]  But I'm blanking on the name of the actor who did the war.
[01:54:25.464 --> 01:54:26.225]  It's fantastic.
[01:54:26.265 --> 01:54:29.726]  He plays the chief ME in Crossing Jordan.
[01:54:29.806 --> 01:54:31.907]  And I'll look him up on the Internet Movie Database.
[01:54:31.927 --> 01:54:34.228]  But if I can find that clip, I'm going to put it up on my site.
[01:54:34.648 --> 01:54:35.189]  Absolutely.
[01:54:35.229 --> 01:54:37.010]  Let's talk to Roman in California.
[01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.850]  Roman, you're on the air.
[01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:38.670]  Yeah.
[01:54:38.730 --> 01:54:39.631]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:54:41.311 --> 01:54:48.315]  I called to talk about a very important issue that I've actually been researching nonstop day and night.
[01:54:48.355 --> 01:54:49.155]  Well, go ahead and bring it up.
[01:54:49.747 --> 01:54:51.669]  And that is, uh, Disney.
[01:54:52.329 --> 01:55:02.838]  You see, Disney has been propagandizing the American youth to be sexually active, and they've also been aiding Dime Corps in the child kidnapping rings.
[01:55:03.599 --> 01:55:04.780]  And what's your evidence of that?
[01:55:05.706 --> 01:55:15.173]  Well, you see, if you look into the subject, you'll notice that they hide subliminal pornography in most of their movies.
[01:55:15.193 --> 01:55:16.474]  Yeah, I've seen that.
[01:55:16.814 --> 01:55:18.676]  I mean, I know they put jokes in there and things.
[01:55:18.936 --> 01:55:20.237]  Listen, let me do this, okay?
[01:55:20.938 --> 01:55:22.058]  This is a big subject.
[01:55:22.098 --> 01:55:22.979]  I don't know anything about it.
[01:55:23.099 --> 01:55:24.720]  Disney's involvement with Dying Core.
[01:55:25.321 --> 01:55:29.964]  I'd like you to go to the message board and post your proof up on the Present Planet message board.
[01:55:30.445 --> 01:55:33.207]  That's a great way for you to communicate and show everybody else what you're talking about.
[01:55:33.943 --> 01:55:35.384]  But I appreciate your call, Roman.
[01:55:36.245 --> 01:55:38.466]  George in Indiana, you're on the air, George, go ahead.
[01:55:39.067 --> 01:55:40.408]  Yeah, Alex, a couple of things.
[01:55:41.128 --> 01:55:46.572]  First off, I manage an apartment complex, and I'm starting to notice how dumb people are.
[01:55:46.632 --> 01:55:54.298]  I mean, I can't believe I'm hearing conversations that just, almost like that little lady in Miss Teen America.
[01:55:55.439 --> 01:55:58.381]  It's amazing, even in the stores, people aren't talking right anymore.
[01:56:00.116 --> 01:56:01.838]  There's an accelerated dumbing down.
[01:56:01.878 --> 01:56:06.921]  When you watch a lot of television, that causes cognitive loss of IQ.
[01:56:07.562 --> 01:56:09.463]  When you play video games, it's even worse.
[01:56:09.523 --> 01:56:15.067]  It takes you into a near-death brainwave only associated with oxygen loss.
[01:56:15.567 --> 01:56:17.048]  That's a major sign that it reports.
[01:56:17.609 --> 01:56:19.130]  And yes, there is a waxing.
[01:56:19.170 --> 01:56:23.353]  Either people are getting more informed and smarter, or they're getting dumber and the gulf is widening.
[01:56:23.593 --> 01:56:24.934]  Mike Rivero comments on that.
[01:56:26.329 --> 01:56:34.435]  Absolutely, I agree with that, except I wish to add the comment that in the case of the dumbing down fight, some of that is really self-imposed.
[01:56:35.336 --> 01:56:42.122]  You know, we're all raised to believe that we're good citizens, we would stand up for truth and justice if we saw it happening in front of us.
[01:56:42.902 --> 01:56:54.072]  But when people are actually confronted with it, you know, I mean, to actually stand up and deal with a government that has gone wrong carries risks to home and health and person that we're all too well aware of.
[01:56:54.457 --> 01:56:56.538]  And a lot of people really don't want to deal with that.
[01:56:56.718 --> 01:57:01.139]  No, but I was talking to a writer, it was your interview with me last week, and he agreed.
[01:57:01.199 --> 01:57:05.600]  He said, I'm hearing people like chortle and bleep and make monkey noises now.
[01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:11.102]  I mean, is that what you're saying, George, is that you're noticing that they're not even really talking anymore?
[01:57:11.582 --> 01:57:12.343]  Oh, yeah.
[01:57:12.563 --> 01:57:16.164]  I mean, they can make words, but they can't complete sentences.
[01:57:16.184 --> 01:57:18.744]  You can't figure out what in the world they're talking about.
[01:57:18.844 --> 01:57:19.725]  No, no, I'm noticing.
[01:57:19.785 --> 01:57:22.406]  It's almost like Invasion of the Body Snatchers or something.
[01:57:22.806 --> 01:57:23.586]  They'll just go like,
[01:57:24.289 --> 01:57:31.132]  B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-
[01:57:49.725 --> 01:57:53.909]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.589 --> 01:57:55.390]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.150 --> 01:57:57.071]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.712 --> 01:58:01.675]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.895 --> 01:58:06.018]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:14.025]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour in 30 minutes, I'm going to do about a five-minute news blitz of all the stuff I haven't covered.
[01:58:14.646 --> 01:58:16.247]  Then we're going to have popping in with us
[01:58:20.544 --> 01:58:26.807]  Luke Rudowsky is running the operations up in New York for the 6th anniversary that I'll be attending.
[01:58:27.287 --> 01:58:28.807]  I know we got a lot of phone calls here.
[01:58:30.768 --> 01:58:32.209]  Is George Indiana still there?
[01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.869]  I forgot to ask.
[01:58:33.590 --> 01:58:35.191]  George, finish up what you were saying real fast.
[01:58:35.211 --> 01:58:52.843]  I mean, I think Mike is talking about intelligent people engaging in double-thinking, willfully disengaging from society, and just saying, I can't change it, I'm just going to be a hedonist, versus actual breakdown of civilization, maybe in the area of Hawaii or upscale area he's in, he isn't seeing it.
[01:58:53.163 --> 01:58:57.246]  But I mean, you haven't noticed, Mike, that some people are actually acting like animals now?
[01:58:58.719 --> 01:59:04.344]  I'm definitely seeing a lot of that, and I think it's part of what you were calling it, hedonism.
[01:59:04.384 --> 01:59:10.049]  I sort of look at it more as a nihilism, this idea that no matter what... Annihilistic!
[01:59:10.589 --> 01:59:11.790]  Yeah, very much so.
[01:59:12.471 --> 01:59:18.016]  But I think in a lot of cases, you know, certainly thinking is being discouraged as opposed to simply feeling.
[01:59:18.817 --> 01:59:19.278]  Thank you.
[01:59:31.307 --> 01:59:33.428]  Scary places that they don't want to go to.
[01:59:33.448 --> 01:59:37.049]  Well, more than that, we're a couple generations into television now.
[01:59:37.469 --> 01:59:38.549]  It's destroying words.
[01:59:38.589 --> 01:59:43.331]  I mean, even George Orwell, when he wrote 1984 and 1948, was talking about the destruction of the language.
[01:59:43.771 --> 01:59:46.872]  I try to read what founding fathers wrote in private letters.
[01:59:46.892 --> 01:59:50.893]  I have to get out an encyclopedia or dictionary, and they're not trying to be wordy.
[01:59:50.953 --> 01:59:53.334]  They're just, you know, really had large vocabularies.
[01:59:53.714 --> 01:59:55.014]  I reached up a hundred years old.
[01:59:55.554 --> 01:59:57.695]  I mean, I see that I'm downgraded.
[01:59:58.195 --> 02:00:04.337]  And so the point I'm making is I think we're now seeing the next wave pretty soon, and I think it's going to be literally like monkeys.
[02:00:05.898 --> 02:00:15.142]  Well, I think Orwell was very accurate that if you change the language so that the words don't exist for the banned thoughts, then the banned thoughts, you know, will go away.
[02:00:16.182 --> 02:00:21.904]  As far as our founding fathers, and certainly going back to reading the works of William Shakespeare, language was the thing they had fun with.
[02:00:21.944 --> 02:00:22.905]  They didn't have TV.
[02:00:22.945 --> 02:00:23.925]  They didn't have iPods.
[02:00:24.304 --> 02:00:29.893]  They showed off with each other by playing with the language and that was how they proved their social standing.
[02:00:30.213 --> 02:00:31.556]  Well, we don't have that anymore.
[02:00:31.596 --> 02:00:36.644]  People prove their social standing by wearing the latest Nike shoes or the latest colors and stuff.
[02:00:36.684 --> 02:00:37.345]  Disgusting!
[02:00:38.001 --> 02:00:43.788]  Well, words also become mental images, and words actually help you become more intelligent.
[02:00:44.208 --> 02:00:44.949]  It's addicting!
[02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:50.535]  I don't know how they... Who wants some baubles on your hand or some fanciness?
[02:00:50.575 --> 02:00:55.721]  I mean, it's not bad to want a nice car, but when that's how you communicate, it's a joke, man!
[02:00:56.181 --> 02:00:57.122]  One more question, Alex.
[02:00:57.383 --> 02:00:57.623]  Yeah.
[02:00:59.645 --> 02:01:04.809]  I'd like for you to speak to the fact that if we do go into martial law, who exactly do they pick up first?
[02:01:04.889 --> 02:01:16.697]  Because I have a friend that he's from another country, makes straight A's in college, gets caught rolling a joint outside of a bar, and he's getting ready to do 30 days.
[02:01:17.738 --> 02:01:23.102]  Okay, let me, I appreciate your call, and I'm sure Mike will probably concur with this, because it's just what we've seen common sense.
[02:01:24.111 --> 02:01:31.817]  Martial law will just be more checkpoints, more bags searched, not having due process if they trump something up to arrest you.
[02:01:31.857 --> 02:01:36.861]  But at first they'll arrest people like foreigners and guys with turbans to make it look legitimate.
[02:01:37.221 --> 02:01:39.623]  Then they'll move on against their real targets.
[02:01:39.663 --> 02:01:45.687]  Then they can start grabbing bank accounts, start grabbing whole pension funds, and then if you riot in the streets they'll gun you down.
[02:01:45.987 --> 02:01:48.889]  That's why they want the martial law more than anything.
[02:01:48.929 --> 02:01:49.470]  Mike Rivera,
[02:01:50.482 --> 02:01:51.183]  Absolutely.
[02:01:51.303 --> 02:01:54.766]  It's like that old saying left over from Germany in World War II.
[02:01:55.066 --> 02:01:58.289]  First they came for the communists and I said nothing because I wasn't a communist.
[02:01:59.369 --> 02:02:00.631]  It always encroaches.
[02:02:00.891 --> 02:02:09.278]  We started out with this idea that we were going to have warrantless surveillance only on foreigners who were calling the United States or people in the US who were calling outside the US.
[02:02:09.578 --> 02:02:13.401]  Now we find out it's been on total internal phone conversations all along.
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:14.360]  Thank you.
[02:02:23.838 --> 02:02:31.886]  And worried about who's listening in that they stop talking to each other and continue their emotional and informational dependence upon the TV set.
[02:02:32.106 --> 02:02:41.074]  And now they're setting up 26,000 tattletale preachers, neighborhood squads filling out dossiers on your neighbors, the state police are doing it.
[02:02:41.335 --> 02:02:43.417]  I mean, folks, they're not playing games.
[02:02:43.437 --> 02:02:44.598]  We're in martial law.
[02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:55.564]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:02:55.824 --> 02:03:07.048]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:03:07.389 --> 02:03:13.091]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:03:13.331 --> 02:03:19.974]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:03:20.194 --> 02:03:27.038]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:03:27.298 --> 02:03:29.059]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[02:03:29.319 --> 02:03:31.400]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:31.720]  Get it?
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:32.080]  We're good.
[02:03:48.346 --> 02:03:53.811]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:54.211 --> 02:04:01.817]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.529 --> 02:04:09.593]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.993 --> 02:04:21.419]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.719 --> 02:04:25.221]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.682 --> 02:04:27.623]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.943 --> 02:04:31.785]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:46.664 --> 02:04:52.085]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:04:52.505 --> 02:04:57.246]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:04:57.646 --> 02:05:00.267]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:05:00.767 --> 02:05:04.168]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:05:04.948 --> 02:05:09.269]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:12.889]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:05:13.489 --> 02:05:16.310]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:05:17.108 --> 02:05:19.269]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:19.289 --> 02:05:21.069]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.330]  U.S.
[02:05:21.350 --> 02:05:23.490]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.870]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[02:05:24.231 --> 02:05:24.691]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:05:24.711 --> 02:05:25.371]  Ask for George.
[02:05:46.298 --> 02:05:48.481]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.062 --> 02:05:51.845]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:04.227 --> 02:06:10.889]  Well, Mike Rivero riding shotgun with us once a month of WhatReallyHappened.com has done a lot of research on the DC Madam case.
[02:06:11.429 --> 02:06:13.769]  So I thought, hey, it's good to have him ride shotgun with us.
[02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:27.473]  Then I will get to Nate, John, Will, and a few others, and then get into the news, and then of course an update from Luke Radowski up in New York for the sixth anniversary of the 9-11 attacks.
[02:06:27.553 --> 02:06:30.613]  We're going to be up there for the memorial, so that's coming up as well this hour.
[02:06:32.454 --> 02:06:33.634]  Going to Deborah
[02:06:34.355 --> 02:06:36.876]  Jay Palfrey, or Jean Palfrey, as she's known, the D.C.
[02:06:37.297 --> 02:06:37.637]  madam.
[02:06:38.217 --> 02:06:39.037]  We have copies of it.
[02:06:39.057 --> 02:06:42.959]  The contract that the girl signed, nothing illegal, standard escort service.
[02:06:43.300 --> 02:06:44.960]  She's paid the fee for the escort going.
[02:06:45.241 --> 02:06:47.642]  What happens after that, you know, who knows?
[02:06:47.742 --> 02:06:49.523]  I mean, this is going on everywhere.
[02:06:50.063 --> 02:06:51.124]  Why was she grabbed?
[02:06:51.184 --> 02:06:52.804]  Why was her assets grabbed?
[02:06:54.085 --> 02:06:57.127]  And ABC got the records, the phone records.
[02:06:57.187 --> 02:07:01.709]  They found a bunch of prominent people, but say on the TV report that
[02:07:02.834 --> 02:07:08.735]  I just watched that the other day again, that they weren't going to announce who it was, and that they didn't think it was important.
[02:07:08.755 --> 02:07:10.575]  Yeah, it was some high-powered people, but so what?
[02:07:10.976 --> 02:07:19.357]  She's now trying to subpoena them to get those records, or the results of those records, and so we're honored to have her here with us.
[02:07:20.117 --> 02:07:21.337]  Jean Palfrey, thanks for coming on.
[02:07:21.757 --> 02:07:23.738]  Well, thank you for inviting me.
[02:07:23.758 --> 02:07:30.019]  Just in a few minutes here, if you can, just recap and then give us any new info, and then I know Mike Rivera's got some questions for you.
[02:07:30.680 --> 02:07:35.601]  Okay, well, regarding ABC subpoenaing ABC, we'll be doing that most likely next week.
[02:07:36.341 --> 02:07:48.684]  Also, and we're doing that because ABC did not divulge the information that they obtained during their seven and a half, almost eight week investigation into my records.
[02:07:49.104 --> 02:07:57.726]  So we very much want to know what they found out that they would not disclose on the 2020 broadcast, which aired last May 4th.
[02:07:58.613 --> 02:08:02.775]  Also, we have connected with a company called Catafora.
[02:08:02.835 --> 02:08:08.578]  Catafora is a data mining company based in Redwood City, California.
[02:08:09.218 --> 02:08:15.721]  Very, very prominent company when it comes to finding intractable data.
[02:08:16.281 --> 02:08:23.825]  And we are working with them and will be working with them more in the future to dig down into those records and determine
[02:08:24.286 --> 02:08:27.088]  Who used the service, when, under what circumstances?
[02:08:27.168 --> 02:08:29.550]  Because these records go back how many years?
[02:08:30.811 --> 02:08:32.272]  Thirteen years to the fall of 1993.
[02:08:33.132 --> 02:08:42.359]  And so they can data mine and see what phone numbers those were ten, thirteen years ago, five years ago, six months ago, since they've changed.
[02:08:42.859 --> 02:08:51.125]  Let's bring Mike Rivero in because Mike's quite an accomplished investigator from the Vince Foster case, the list goes on and on and he's been looking into this
[02:08:52.346 --> 02:09:03.051]  You know, talking to Jean Palfrey, Mike, you know, she obviously believes there's more behind this, that people are being watched, that this was some type of intelligence op or blackmail op going on.
[02:09:03.572 --> 02:09:10.776]  Why do you think this case has been so strange, Mike, or do you have any questions that might help us flesh something out for Jean Palfrey?
[02:09:11.516 --> 02:09:16.119]  Well, first of all, I've been following the case closely, and Jean's actually been on my show at one point.
[02:09:16.159 --> 02:09:17.599]  Hi, Jean, nice to talk to you again.
[02:09:17.940 --> 02:09:18.540]  Same here, Mike.
[02:09:19.464 --> 02:09:37.272]  And, uh, but I'm in agreement that the reason there's so much focus on this, uh, is because, uh, not any one individual, uh, person who used the service, but that certain corporations and even government agencies may have been involved, and that this is the real reason that there's an attempt to sort of shut this whole thing down and silence it.
[02:09:37.632 --> 02:09:45.295]  My understanding is that ABC itself is on that phone list, and that this is the reason why they decided to back off when they, uh, they did the story.
[02:09:46.549 --> 02:09:55.456]  on sixty minutes then again on the other hand it may simply be that congress views any other bordello inside the DC limits is unfair competition and wishes to simply get rid of it.
[02:09:58.379 --> 02:10:05.625]  What about that piece of info or that intel that Mike's gotten that ABC is in the phone records?
[02:10:06.245 --> 02:10:07.907]  Have you run into that yet Gene?
[02:10:10.047 --> 02:10:10.467]  Who knows?
[02:10:10.547 --> 02:10:12.328]  Who knows who are in those phone records?
[02:10:12.368 --> 02:10:29.676]  That's why we are working with a company called Cataphor, or certainly will be in the coming weeks, because they have the power, they have the software, they have the technology, they have the wherewithal and the ability to get down into those records, unlike the rest of us who are pretty much, for all intents and purposes, lay people.
[02:10:30.117 --> 02:10:35.099]  And we know that the bought and paid for media certainly doesn't want to go down into those records.
[02:10:35.717 --> 02:10:43.119]  So, who's left to ascertain who really did and did not use the service?
[02:10:44.559 --> 02:10:58.603]  Besides, let me just say this, fellas, besides, to expect some average Joe Blow out there in Minneapolis, for example, as a hobby, to find out who some of these people were, why they were in D.C.
[02:10:58.643 --> 02:11:02.784]  at a certain time, certain patterns in his records, it's really too much.
[02:11:02.804 --> 02:11:04.945]  I mean, you would have to be a genius, you would have to have
[02:11:05.558 --> 02:11:07.379]  Certain technology that sort of thing.
[02:11:07.919 --> 02:11:31.006]  The folks at Cataphor have all of this and they are the professionals and we anticipate that they will be able to uncover quite a bit of information that will not lead us in the direction that this is a prostitution service so much as somebody was watching me and they were watching me for quite a while as far back as March of 2004 that I can ascertain.
[02:11:31.465 --> 02:11:40.151]  They were watching me and they were watching me for a reason and it had nothing, and I've said this so many times and I'll say it again, it had nothing to do with prostitution related activities.
[02:11:40.191 --> 02:11:41.672]  Mike, why do you think they were watching her?
[02:11:42.472 --> 02:11:57.462]  Well, I think obviously that if any particularly influential individual was proven to be using the service, whether or not any prostitution actually happened, it still opens them up to manipulation through blackmail.
[02:11:57.836 --> 02:11:59.137]  And as we know, Washington D.C.
[02:11:59.217 --> 02:12:02.360]  is, you know, everybody's intelligence services are there trying to gain an edge.
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:09.506]  We know that a lot of our enemies, and even a few of our friends, are always trying to find ways to blackmail our politicians.
[02:12:09.566 --> 02:12:23.077]  If you go back to the Whitewater Report, where Bill Clinton informed Monica Lewinsky that some unnamed party had succeeded in recording some of their phone sex conversations, and was using them to apply pressure to the White House.
[02:12:23.610 --> 02:12:41.954]  So, regardless of what was actually going on with the young ladies in question, simply making that connection would be something that could be used to convince a senator, or a congressman, or an officer, or even a corporate official to change their decision on a certain key policy.
[02:12:42.574 --> 02:12:46.635]  Yes, that's absolutely right, and that's one of the very reasons why I put the records out there.
[02:12:46.935 --> 02:12:51.396]  This blackmailability, I guess, of certain targets.
[02:12:52.722 --> 02:13:06.207]  As my attorney, my long-suffering civil attorney, Mr. Sibley, has often said, and he's soon to become my criminal attorney here very shortly, he said it would have been irresponsible of the various agencies in the D.C.
[02:13:06.407 --> 02:13:12.569]  area, or national agencies, CIA, NSA, FBI, not to be watching a service like mine.
[02:13:12.929 --> 02:13:19.291]  You have to remember, I catered to some of the best people in Washington and around the country and around the world.
[02:13:19.673 --> 02:13:26.915]  This was very much a Mayflower Madam-like service and it was in operation for 13 years, just a little shy of 13 years.
[02:13:27.455 --> 02:13:32.937]  It was very unusual for a service to have such longevity and to operate on such a high level.
[02:13:33.297 --> 02:13:44.060]  So it is a guarantee that I had certain clients, and it's been proven, who were very high-brow and influential and important political personas.
[02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:46.481]  It would have been irresponsible, again,
[02:13:47.108 --> 02:13:48.449]  Well, we know they were.
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:14.984]  As a big data collection pool, and of course to twist people's arms, the bigger question here now is why didn't ABC release the names they admit that they found on there?
[02:14:16.044 --> 02:14:26.568]  And then the second question, and I want to ask you both this, how do you know you can trust this data mining group if they've got any government contracts because of pressure that can then be put on them via contracts?
[02:14:26.628 --> 02:14:27.408]  First, Mike Rivera.
[02:14:28.448 --> 02:14:46.177]  Well, obviously the way to trust one group is to have a second group working in parallel with it that has no connections, and so with all due deference to Deborah Jean there, I think there are some people working out in the private blogosphere who are quite expert, and by sheer force of numbers, I think they've got something to contribute.
[02:14:46.633 --> 02:14:54.258]  Certainly on the little search engine that we put up on WhatReallyHappened.com, we did make some very strong connections about where some of these numbers were going.
[02:14:54.558 --> 02:15:01.723]  Yeah, break that down, Mike, because you've had quite a few discoveries, thanks to turning your readers and listeners loose on people.
[02:15:02.484 --> 02:15:16.413]  Yeah, basically, just by sheer force of numbers, we found a lot of contact, and so my advice to Deborah Jean is definitely go with this professional service, but go ahead and let the blogosphere act as a double check on what they're finding, because Alex is right.
[02:15:16.838 --> 02:15:31.751]  Any one of these large data mining corporations, if they're doing any government contracts, they can be coerced into hiding certain things, or changing certain things, or worse, luring you into making a misstatement on which you could be prosecuted, or at least smeared and discredited.
[02:15:32.172 --> 02:15:32.772]  Well, that's true.
[02:15:32.812 --> 02:15:41.320]  But least we forget, least we forget, we have Mr. Larry Flynn in the background, who is studiously, studiously going through these records.
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:43.902]  I understand that he has contracted out
[02:15:44.691 --> 02:15:48.895]  Uh, to a private contractor to go through these records as well.
[02:15:48.995 --> 02:15:50.236]  Well, this is his specialty.
[02:15:50.276 --> 02:15:51.797]  He loves going after hypocrites.
[02:15:52.297 --> 02:15:53.218]  I love him or hate him.
[02:15:53.258 --> 02:15:57.321]  That is certainly... Don't we all?
[02:15:57.341 --> 02:15:57.722]  Yeah.
[02:15:57.742 --> 02:16:02.305]  Well, in closing, Jean, would you like to give your website out?
[02:16:03.426 --> 02:16:03.646]  Sure.
[02:16:03.707 --> 02:16:05.308]  It's deborahjeanpalfrey.com.
[02:16:07.625 --> 02:16:12.687]  I'm sure if you can't spell it correctly, just spell it somewhat correctly and up will come something.
[02:16:13.347 --> 02:16:18.750]  But it's D-E-V-O-R-A-H-J-E-A-N-E-P-A-L-F-R-E-Y dot com.
[02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:22.591]  And we've got a link to you up on InfoWars.com for people that are lazy like myself.
[02:16:23.832 --> 02:16:25.072]  Debra, thank you so much.
[02:16:25.332 --> 02:16:27.953]  Debra Jean Palfrey for popping in on the show.
[02:16:28.053 --> 02:16:31.274]  And as things develop, I'd like to continue to have you come in and give us updates.
[02:16:31.314 --> 02:16:31.995]  We're very thankful.
[02:16:32.575 --> 02:16:33.115]  Well, thank you.
[02:16:33.135 --> 02:16:33.695]  Thank you, Mike.
[02:16:34.536 --> 02:16:35.116]  Thank you, Debra.
[02:16:35.689 --> 02:16:38.593]  All right, there goes Gene Palfrey, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:39.494 --> 02:16:39.774]  Mike?
[02:16:40.635 --> 02:16:41.536]  Yes?
[02:16:41.576 --> 02:16:45.000]  Just in the 30 seconds we've got left, any comments you want to add about her case?
[02:16:46.342 --> 02:16:47.683]  About her case?
[02:16:47.703 --> 02:16:50.987]  Yeah, there's definitely intelligence overtones here.
[02:16:51.067 --> 02:16:54.471]  As she said, it's very unusual for an operation like that to last that many years.
[02:16:55.012 --> 02:16:59.473]  And go back and look at the Israeli spy story that Carl Cameron put on Fox News.
[02:16:59.814 --> 02:17:03.475]  Where they were entrenched was the phone billing records.
[02:17:03.855 --> 02:17:09.357]  So there is no question that Israeli intelligence had copies of all of her records even before she made them public.
[02:17:10.717 --> 02:17:13.598]  Man, I tell you, it just keeps popping up, our friends in Israel.
[02:17:14.418 --> 02:17:15.018]  Yes, it does.
[02:17:15.999 --> 02:17:20.760]  I mean, you know me, I'm not here trying to pick a fight with Israel or Israel supporters.
[02:17:21.540 --> 02:17:23.341]  We got a report that keeps popping up, Mike.
[02:17:24.443 --> 02:17:35.069]  Yeah, we do, and they're going to scream anti-Semite, but yes, we do have to keep reporting on these stories as they come up, whether it's the dancing Israelis, the people in the kiosks, the art students.
[02:17:35.529 --> 02:17:37.550]  It's a real situation and it has to be dealt with.
[02:17:37.851 --> 02:17:38.271]  It does.
[02:17:38.331 --> 02:17:39.632]  Mike, thanks for spending time with us.
[02:17:40.432 --> 02:17:41.012]  You're welcome.
[02:17:41.493 --> 02:17:43.654]  We'll be right back with your calls and Luke Rodowski.
[02:17:45.561 --> 02:17:50.805]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:17:50.925 --> 02:17:59.031]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:17:59.291 --> 02:18:06.336]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:18:06.476 --> 02:18:07.437]  We're good to go!
[02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:28.580]  That's right.
[02:18:45.988 --> 02:18:49.829]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us up to gold standard, the U.S.
[02:18:49.869 --> 02:18:51.130]  dollar has been devaluating.
[02:18:51.290 --> 02:18:54.851]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:18:55.151 --> 02:18:57.672]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[02:18:58.072 --> 02:18:59.813]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:19:00.133 --> 02:19:02.374]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:19:03.514 --> 02:19:09.077]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:19:09.117 --> 02:19:11.618]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[02:19:19.182 --> 02:19:21.062]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[02:19:21.263 --> 02:19:23.723]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:19:23.823 --> 02:19:26.784]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[02:19:26.804 --> 02:19:27.484]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:19:27.524 --> 02:19:30.225]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[02:19:30.245 --> 02:19:30.885]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:19:45.089 --> 02:19:49.192]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[02:19:49.452 --> 02:19:54.536]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[02:19:54.836 --> 02:19:59.459]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[02:19:59.819 --> 02:20:01.781]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[02:20:02.081 --> 02:20:07.925]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[02:20:08.285 --> 02:20:09.086]  And it works.
[02:20:09.506 --> 02:20:10.967]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[02:20:11.347 --> 02:20:12.348]  Now it's your turn.
[02:20:12.608 --> 02:20:14.989]  Today you can get a full bottle of Tautenol.
[02:20:15.129 --> 02:20:19.391]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[02:20:19.711 --> 02:20:22.813]  See what Tautenol can do for you and your confidence.
[02:20:23.173 --> 02:20:25.374]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[02:20:25.574 --> 02:20:27.915]  For your risk-free bottle of Tautenol, call 1-800-894-5152.
[02:20:27.935 --> 02:20:28.175]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[02:20:28.195 --> 02:20:30.877]  Tautenol is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[02:20:30.897 --> 02:20:31.117]  Guaranteed!
[02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:41.061]  Call 1-800-894-5152.
[02:20:41.281 --> 02:20:42.861]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[02:20:42.881 --> 02:20:48.723]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[02:20:48.943 --> 02:20:49.843]  Look no further!
[02:20:50.104 --> 02:20:52.684]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[02:20:53.124 --> 02:21:01.547]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:21:01.687 --> 02:21:01.967]  I think so.
[02:21:19.292 --> 02:21:19.632]  I don't know.
[02:21:59.764 --> 02:22:04.247]  Yes Alex, I didn't want to dwell on the disagreement I had with you.
[02:22:04.287 --> 02:22:06.308]  It's just a perfunctory qualifier.
[02:22:06.368 --> 02:22:09.130]  Whenever I tell people to check out InfoWars.com, I always include
[02:22:30.144 --> 02:22:50.771]  The writings of Webster Tarpley, who I'm closer in agreement with, or Ralph Schoenman, on taking aim.info, taking aim.info, because you were talking about the problem of the Zionists being joined at the hip with the most mad warmongers in the military-industrial complex in this country.
[02:22:51.551 --> 02:22:56.413]  And even if you check on Google, on Zionist collaboration with the Nazis,
[02:22:57.831 --> 02:23:01.153]  The Zionist support for Nazis.
[02:23:01.573 --> 02:23:13.780]  You'll find thousands or hundreds of thousands of articles documenting how far from being the protectors of the Jews against antisemitism, the Zionist organization collaborated directly with the Nazis.
[02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:15.841]  And they radiated 110,000 Sephardic Jewish children.
[02:23:19.148 --> 02:23:25.271]  I know, but you know the founders of Israel were about, at least they said they were, socialists.
[02:23:25.291 --> 02:23:26.151]  So how do you square that?
[02:23:26.852 --> 02:23:29.493]  Actually, they collaborated.
[02:23:29.573 --> 02:23:33.095]  If you'll check out Ralph Shulman's stuff on Infowars.com.
[02:23:36.356 --> 02:23:39.158]  You plugged it twice.
[02:23:39.378 --> 02:23:44.180]  I've had Ralph on the show, but if it's deliberate and obnoxious, John, I'm not going to let you do it.
[02:23:44.922 --> 02:23:45.962]  Look, I'll let you plug it twice.
[02:23:45.982 --> 02:23:47.443]  I don't care if you plug it 25 times.
[02:23:47.843 --> 02:23:50.723]  But you're here on air, you don't have to do like a woodpecker saying it over and over again.
[02:23:51.003 --> 02:23:51.924]  Go ahead and make your point.
[02:23:52.364 --> 02:23:56.225]  The point I'm making is that the Zionist organizations actually betrayed the Jews.
[02:23:56.285 --> 02:24:04.066]  And in fact, they were allied with Himmler and Eichmann against the Communists and the Socialists, who were the leading resistance against the Nazis.
[02:24:04.246 --> 02:24:04.887]  That is true.
[02:24:05.147 --> 02:24:05.767]  That is true.
[02:24:06.127 --> 02:24:08.908]  And if you look at the fact that these 26,000 pastors
[02:24:11.052 --> 02:24:19.520]  Who are acting as the Judenrat against the people in this country and their flock, the ram that leads the sheep to slaughter.
[02:24:19.960 --> 02:24:31.711]  They had their antecedent by Rudolf Kastner, who was one of the leading Zionists, collaborating with the Nazis to pacify the Jewish people who were being slaughtered in Hungary.
[02:24:32.692 --> 02:24:37.056]  A million of them killed and sent to the Auschwitz concentration death camps.
[02:24:37.603 --> 02:24:49.471]  And he made an actual alliance with Himmler and Eichmann to pacify them, say they were going to... I know, and even top scholars who are Jewish, by the way, in the U.S.
[02:24:49.491 --> 02:24:50.432]  have written books on that.
[02:24:50.892 --> 02:24:59.158]  And that's the thing the ADL and Southern Poverty Law can't deal with, is the fact that the Zionists literally supported Hitler from his foundations.
[02:24:59.518 --> 02:25:04.421]  They love it when you deny that Hitler was bad and deny he killed people, because that's a fraud and a lie.
[02:25:04.461 --> 02:25:06.483]  Hitler was bad and he did kill millions.
[02:25:07.183 --> 02:25:08.965]  Uh, but they do not like it when you attack them.
[02:25:09.165 --> 02:25:12.367]  Well, that's just like when I attack Arnold for being a Nazi, they attack me.
[02:25:12.387 --> 02:25:19.232]  I mean, he's a real live Nazi, so he admires Hitler, gives speeches about it, and then you're a Nazi if you say a Nazi's bad.
[02:25:19.252 --> 02:25:20.813]  And it's because they're Nazis.
[02:25:21.653 --> 02:25:31.540]  It's incredible that they have so much power, posing as the defenders and the guardians of Jews against anti-Semitism, and they were the collaborators with the Nazis in the Holocaust.
[02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:35.403]  And you can check those sites, even Google, to find that out, and they now
[02:25:36.002 --> 02:25:39.523]  Are in a position where everyone goes on bended knees.
[02:25:39.583 --> 02:25:43.624]  The Democrats, the Republicans, every one of the leading Democrats makes their pilgrimages.
[02:25:43.704 --> 02:25:48.345]  What do you think of all the big liberals worshipping Hillary and she's ten points ahead of everybody?
[02:25:48.405 --> 02:25:53.146]  And she receives more money than any politician from the APEC-Israeli lobby.
[02:25:53.266 --> 02:26:01.748]  All of the leading politicians make their pilgrimages on bended knee to tell them anything you want, any aggression you want to perpetrate, we'll call it defense.
[02:26:02.588 --> 02:26:04.669]  We'll saber-rattle against Iran.
[02:26:05.123 --> 02:26:10.127]  We have no hope among the leading Democrats, as much as from Hillary or any of these people.
[02:26:10.148 --> 02:26:13.831]  They could be even more dangerous, because Bush has damaged goods now.
[02:26:13.911 --> 02:26:15.052]  People are catching on to him.
[02:26:15.512 --> 02:26:21.898]  And the Democrats are sowing war, this disastrous war against Iran, even more effectively than Bush could.
[02:26:21.938 --> 02:26:28.804]  They are absolute traitors, just like the Zionists did in collaborating with Hitler, just like these 26,000 pastors are acting as the pacifiers,
[02:26:32.509 --> 02:26:34.970]  The ram that's going to lead the people to the slaughter.
[02:26:34.990 --> 02:26:36.151]  The Judas Code!
[02:26:36.791 --> 02:26:37.992]  Yeah, the Judas Code.
[02:26:38.252 --> 02:26:50.918]  And I think that we've really got to stop this fear that we're going to be called anti-Semitic if we criticize these mad, raving, dual citizens within the U.S.
[02:26:50.958 --> 02:26:57.661]  military complex that are simply carrying out the most extreme versions of war that is going to lead us into disaster.
[02:26:58.201 --> 02:27:01.363]  And I was reading on
[02:27:02.401 --> 02:27:25.343]  uh... counter punch and I don't like uh... some of the things he puts on there because he's uh... for some strange reason against the 9-11 truth movement but there was an article there about how if you want to get a gauge of who's supporting this war against Iran that will lead to catastrophe ten to twenty times as much money from the APEC lobby as going to all those Democrats who support this sabre-rattling against Iran.
[02:27:25.483 --> 02:27:27.185]  I know, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:27:35.862 --> 02:27:36.803]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.283 --> 02:27:38.885]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.806 --> 02:27:42.510]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.071 --> 02:27:52.374]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:27:52.695 --> 02:27:57.978]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:27:58.398 --> 02:28:01.400]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[02:28:48.139 --> 02:28:52.481]  This is George Whitehurst-Berry with the Genesis Communications Network.
[02:28:52.942 --> 02:28:55.363]  Welcome to our new program, Crash!
[02:28:55.683 --> 02:28:56.343]  Are you ready?
[02:28:56.663 --> 02:29:02.786]  In the coming weeks, we will focus on alternative economics as well as alternative health and survival topics.
[02:29:03.146 --> 02:29:06.548]  We are now in the largest debt bubble in U.S.
[02:29:06.588 --> 02:29:07.028]  history.
[02:29:07.408 --> 02:29:10.590]  A subset of the debt bubble is the real estate bubble.
[02:29:11.190 --> 02:29:18.156]  And I believe we are in the beginning stages of what could be the biggest real estate crash in our nation's history.
[02:29:18.436 --> 02:29:23.461]  For crash updates, visit our website at hereononline.com.
[02:29:23.901 --> 02:29:30.707]  That's H-E-A-R-I-T-O-N-L-I-N-E dot com.
[02:29:31.388 --> 02:29:40.002]  Here at Online.com that's H-E-A-R-I-T-O-N-L-I-N-E dot com
[02:29:45.527 --> 02:29:47.489]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[02:29:47.749 --> 02:29:50.811]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[02:29:51.071 --> 02:29:55.855]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[02:29:56.155 --> 02:29:58.897]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[02:29:59.158 --> 02:30:03.821]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[02:30:04.101 --> 02:30:06.023]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[02:30:06.483 --> 02:30:16.427]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology, and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[02:30:16.787 --> 02:30:21.509]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[02:30:21.869 --> 02:30:25.371]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[02:30:25.611 --> 02:30:27.752]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[02:30:28.072 --> 02:30:30.233]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings,
[02:30:30.413 --> 02:30:32.195]  We'll even refund the shipping charge!
[02:30:32.516 --> 02:30:35.619]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now!
[02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:36.741]  What are you waiting for?
[02:30:36.921 --> 02:30:37.602]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[02:30:37.702 --> 02:30:38.223]  That's 1-888-873-7371 today!
[02:30:56.798 --> 02:31:05.285]  Yeah, there's no doubt that Israel is ordering the United States, I mean ordering, in their newspapers, to attack
[02:31:28.793 --> 02:31:29.254]  Iran.
[02:31:30.554 --> 02:31:33.316]  And the question is, does the tail wag the dog?
[02:31:34.417 --> 02:31:35.798]  The question is, will they be able to do it?
[02:31:35.818 --> 02:31:42.242]  And then there's a collection of other interests who want to attack, who want power, who want control.
[02:31:43.723 --> 02:31:50.168]  But Israel's out front in it, and you've got other military interests doing it, media interests, you've got
[02:31:52.077 --> 02:31:58.080]  I have to say, the large swaths of the establishment, who are very wicked in their own right, are not for what's happening.
[02:31:58.120 --> 02:32:00.522]  The Saudi Arabians kind of like the attack on Iran.
[02:32:01.182 --> 02:32:02.103]  They're not friends with them.
[02:32:02.143 --> 02:32:12.148]  They hate them, because Iran is Shiite, and Saudi Arabia is, of course, the big enchilada there, and they're almost completely Sunni.
[02:32:14.589 --> 02:32:17.251]  The opposite, the group from which Al Qaeda springs,
[02:32:18.436 --> 02:32:21.217]  I'm not getting into a Sunni versus Shiite argument here.
[02:32:21.257 --> 02:32:26.157]  The point is, is that that's why it's so crazy when I hear, we've got to attack Iran!
[02:32:26.177 --> 02:32:27.298]  They're with Al Qaeda!
[02:32:28.498 --> 02:32:31.458]  It just, for those that don't know, for those that don't know where the U.S.
[02:32:31.498 --> 02:32:36.239]  is on a map, you tune in for the first time, you know, you're like Miss Teen USA from South Carolina.
[02:32:36.699 --> 02:32:38.220]  That's the opposite group, okay?
[02:32:38.260 --> 02:32:38.800]  It's a joke.
[02:32:39.880 --> 02:32:41.180]  Our military's been taken over.
[02:32:41.300 --> 02:32:42.501]  Our government's been taken over.
[02:32:42.821 --> 02:32:44.641]  The very people trying to launch this war,
[02:32:47.100 --> 02:32:53.262]  Are the individuals that are destroying our sovereignty, our currency, our way of life, by design.
[02:32:53.422 --> 02:32:54.303]  They are our enemies.
[02:32:58.444 --> 02:32:59.625]  And I don't want to be a slave.
[02:32:59.745 --> 02:33:00.365]  Bondage.
[02:33:00.425 --> 02:33:01.946]  I've never experienced it.
[02:33:02.106 --> 02:33:05.887]  I've experienced oppression and police state and humiliation and things and that's fine.
[02:33:06.207 --> 02:33:10.089]  But true bondage is not something I want my family or your family to experience.
[02:33:10.149 --> 02:33:15.551]  And believe me, they, the government, the criminals that run it, say they're forging bondage for all of us.
[02:33:16.681 --> 02:33:22.967]  You can hear the chains clanking that they want to put on us.
[02:33:23.608 --> 02:33:25.349]  If you want to go along with tyranny, that's fine.
[02:33:25.810 --> 02:33:28.652]  May your chains, as Patrick Henry said, sit lightly upon you.
[02:33:29.053 --> 02:33:29.733]  Go from us.
[02:33:29.813 --> 02:33:32.115]  Forget that you are our brethren, our countrymen.
[02:33:36.525 --> 02:33:38.066]  But make the decision.
[02:33:38.166 --> 02:33:40.167]  At least admit you're a groveling slave.
[02:33:40.208 --> 02:33:41.368]  Admit you're a coward.
[02:33:41.789 --> 02:33:43.009]  Admit you want tyranny.
[02:33:43.049 --> 02:33:43.970]  Admit you don't care.
[02:33:44.030 --> 02:33:45.531]  Admit you have no respect for yourself.
[02:33:46.091 --> 02:33:49.954]  Don't sit there and say, we're not patriotic and we're bad.
[02:33:50.274 --> 02:33:52.216]  Listen, you don't know what a PDD is.
[02:33:52.476 --> 02:33:54.257]  You don't know what an executive order is.
[02:33:54.497 --> 02:33:55.378]  You haven't read them.
[02:33:55.578 --> 02:33:56.739]  You don't know our history.
[02:33:56.979 --> 02:33:58.800]  You haven't read the Anti-Federalist Papers.
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:00.581]  You haven't read the Federalist Papers.
[02:34:00.821 --> 02:34:02.562]  You don't know the straits we're in.
[02:34:02.602 --> 02:34:03.563]  You don't know history.
[02:34:03.923 --> 02:34:06.285]  And I'm frankly, I'm tired of you shooting your mouths off.
[02:34:11.187 --> 02:34:17.309]  All right, I promise we're going to get to Nate, William, Rhonda, and Pat.
[02:34:17.329 --> 02:34:18.249]  That'll be it for calls.
[02:34:18.289 --> 02:34:19.049]  I'm going to get to you.
[02:34:19.610 --> 02:34:21.910]  I've got five or six news articles I want to hit too.
[02:34:21.930 --> 02:34:23.511]  We're going to cram those in the last segment.
[02:34:24.711 --> 02:34:27.813]  But right now, I want to bring Luke Rodowski up.
[02:34:28.413 --> 02:34:30.574]  Luke, big events coming up in New York.
[02:34:30.594 --> 02:34:31.754]  This is the sixth anniversary.
[02:34:31.794 --> 02:34:32.554]  It's almost here.
[02:34:33.054 --> 02:34:34.555]  People need to be part of history.
[02:34:36.111 --> 02:34:39.073]  And if it isn't going to New York, folks, pick another issue and get involved.
[02:34:39.373 --> 02:34:44.237]  Sovereignty, the borders, the currency, the economy.
[02:34:44.257 --> 02:34:47.860]  I mean, we're in crisis at every level.
[02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:51.122]  But I'm telling you, it can't get any more historical than this.
[02:34:51.643 --> 02:35:02.311]  And your presence there to force the mainstream media to report, which they had to do last year, that there are thousands of people there who don't buy the official story, that is key.
[02:35:03.081 --> 02:35:23.116]  Because when you have the murdering New World Order culprits who carried out the attacks, up there grandstanding and posing as saviors, and using the deaths of the 2,800 plus people they killed as fuel for their New World Order, and the further destruction and dismemberment of our beloved Republic, it demands
[02:35:24.915 --> 02:35:25.476]  Resistance.
[02:35:25.556 --> 02:35:27.197]  It demands that we stand up.
[02:35:27.337 --> 02:35:34.782]  It demands that affront, that blasphemous, disgusting fraud demands that we be there.
[02:35:36.743 --> 02:35:37.544]  And we're going to be there.
[02:35:38.405 --> 02:35:42.568]  Now the big one that all of you got to be at is 8 in the morning.
[02:35:43.408 --> 02:35:49.072]  And it's going to go until noon, but you can show up at 10 if you want, but it's best to be there early in the morning.
[02:35:50.473 --> 02:35:52.835]  And if you won't get up early for your country, I don't know what you're going to do.
[02:35:54.917 --> 02:36:06.406]  But they're in New York, and if you live in New Jersey or Ohio or Connecticut or New Hampshire or any surrounding areas, you need to go to New York.
[02:36:06.426 --> 02:36:12.451]  You need to take off Monday and Tuesday and drive out there and come to the event.
[02:36:12.591 --> 02:36:14.633]  That is the key, that silent vigil.
[02:36:15.453 --> 02:36:17.695]  Then there's a separate demonstration we're going to have after that.
[02:36:18.431 --> 02:36:24.436]  There's a lot of other events.
[02:36:24.496 --> 02:36:26.277]  Luke, tell folks about the events that are coming up.
[02:36:26.737 --> 02:36:36.725]  Well, it's going to be historic, and we all know not a lot of it is in his job, but now it's time to do something about it, and we're really going to provide something to do the right thing, and we're doing a fundraiser.
[02:36:36.745 --> 02:36:38.166]  We're going to have three days of events.
[02:36:38.486 --> 02:36:42.149]  The events start off on Sunday at New World Stages here in New York City.
[02:36:42.739 --> 02:36:46.420]  Excuse me, at Webster Hall, one of the nightclubs here in New York City.
[02:36:46.780 --> 02:36:47.821]  And we're going to have Richard Gage.
[02:36:47.841 --> 02:36:48.961]  We're going to have family members.
[02:36:48.981 --> 02:36:50.141]  We're going to have rescue workers.
[02:36:50.181 --> 02:36:53.162]  We're going to have celebrities, such as Daniel Sundiata, Christine Ubersol.
[02:36:53.482 --> 02:36:59.044]  And of course, we're going to have you, Alex Jones, premiering your greatest, I think it's going to be one of your better documentaries, Endgame.
[02:36:59.444 --> 02:37:02.945]  After that, we're going to have a tootstock with M1 from Dead Presidents performing.
[02:37:03.265 --> 02:37:06.426]  The day after that, that's where we're going to be going to New World Stages on Monday.
[02:37:07.026 --> 02:37:10.550]  And that's where we're going to have our food stock with many, multiple events there.
[02:37:10.570 --> 02:37:13.614]  We're going to have more family members, more rescue workers, more celebrities.
[02:37:13.634 --> 02:37:16.117]  And this is where we're going to premiere Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:37:16.437 --> 02:37:20.002]  And then we're going to have another concert from Remo Conscious.
[02:37:21.528 --> 02:37:23.130]  And M1 from Dead President.
[02:37:23.490 --> 02:37:25.873]  And as it's going on, we're going to have all the activists there.
[02:37:26.154 --> 02:37:29.077]  We're going to have all the main, not a lot of the truth people there.
[02:37:29.377 --> 02:37:30.799]  We're going to be showing movies all day.
[02:37:30.819 --> 02:37:32.441]  We're going to have a big tribute to Aaron Russo.
[02:37:32.461 --> 02:37:34.403]  We're going to have a big, big tribute to Dan Wallace.
[02:37:35.224 --> 02:37:36.726]  And all proceeds, all profits.
[02:37:36.926 --> 02:37:37.927]  Nobody's getting paid for this.
[02:37:37.947 --> 02:37:38.929]  Not even you, Alex.
[02:37:38.969 --> 02:37:40.370]  You're flying yourself in it, Alex.
[02:37:40.390 --> 02:37:41.712]  That's how ridiculous he is.
[02:37:42.563 --> 02:37:45.106]  All profits go to the first responders.
[02:37:45.566 --> 02:37:48.489]  All money that's raised is going straight to the people who need it most.
[02:37:48.770 --> 02:37:49.650]  And that's the New Yorkers.
[02:37:49.671 --> 02:37:54.415]  That's the 50,000 New Yorkers which are dying because of the EPA's lies on 9-11.
[02:37:54.696 --> 02:37:56.277]  And it's really, we all need to come together.
[02:37:56.538 --> 02:38:00.001]  And on 9-11, at Ground Zero, we could really reach critical mass.
[02:38:00.361 --> 02:38:02.123]  We could make the mainstream media cover us.
[02:38:02.183 --> 02:38:02.684]  We could make
[02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:07.182]  We have to stand up for truth and justice with the family members, with the Rex New Yorkers.
[02:38:07.202 --> 02:38:08.862]  We have to stand up for something that's right.
[02:38:09.102 --> 02:38:14.264]  And we have a perfect opportunity to do that in a peaceful, silent vigil during the memorial of 9-11.
[02:38:14.484 --> 02:38:19.186]  We can't let these criminals take the victims of 9-11 and use them for their own agendas.
[02:38:19.206 --> 02:38:24.488]  We have to take their names back for truth, love, justice, and everything else that's good in this world.
[02:38:24.568 --> 02:38:28.810]  And we have a perfect opportunity to do that on this anniversary here in New York City on 9-11-07.
[02:38:30.854 --> 02:38:32.015]  Absolutely, my friend.
[02:38:32.055 --> 02:38:34.096]  And Luke, I've only seen you do great work.
[02:38:34.116 --> 02:38:38.099]  I've only seen you have a good spirit in this fight and to be focused.
[02:38:38.159 --> 02:38:40.780]  And the fruits that you've borne are just absolutely amazing.
[02:38:41.421 --> 02:38:49.706]  And I commend you for your leadership and everybody that's involved with you trying to be the change that you want to see in the world.
[02:38:49.766 --> 02:38:51.807]  All the details at wearechange.org.
[02:38:53.848 --> 02:38:58.692]  Folks, the great darkness is upon us, but in the darkness the light shines many times brighter.
[02:38:59.133 --> 02:39:05.157]  And all of us are those little lights that can burn like the sun if we all burn together against this tyranny.
[02:39:05.237 --> 02:39:08.700]  And I'm telling you that you don't have to have all the answers.
[02:39:08.720 --> 02:39:10.441]  You don't have to save the world by yourself.
[02:39:10.862 --> 02:39:14.985]  With God's help, if you just put one foot in front of the other and put yourself in front of the enemy,
[02:39:15.505 --> 02:39:21.351]  If the good people take the field and go out on the field against the enemy, we cannot lose.
[02:39:21.792 --> 02:39:22.793]  And that's how this starts.
[02:39:22.873 --> 02:39:26.296]  I want to see you in New York City coming up.
[02:39:27.097 --> 02:39:32.322]  Even if you can only come on Saturday and then go back or Sunday to the events and can't be there on 9-11, that's fine.
[02:39:32.803 --> 02:39:33.964]  But make a pilgrimage.
[02:39:34.804 --> 02:39:38.226]  To this event, we want to see you there.
[02:39:38.286 --> 02:39:39.347]  This is so important.
[02:39:39.367 --> 02:39:43.569]  The New World Order told us that 9-11 was the foundation of the New World.
[02:39:43.869 --> 02:39:55.656]  A new world of tyranny, a new world of police state, a new world of endless hundred-year war, a new war of a national draft, a new war of bondage and humiliation and America's name being hated across the planet.
[02:39:56.416 --> 02:39:57.337]  We have to take
[02:39:58.417 --> 02:40:05.341]  9-11 back, and we have done that already with the majority of Americans, but we have to take it even more now, fully back.
[02:40:05.601 --> 02:40:08.603]  We cannot let the enemy still have their high ground and their strongholds.
[02:40:08.943 --> 02:40:12.605]  We have to go, and we have to face them, and we have to be there.
[02:40:12.745 --> 02:40:13.806]  Everyone bring your camera.
[02:40:13.846 --> 02:40:16.167]  I want to see everybody there.
[02:40:16.587 --> 02:40:18.988]  Be part of history, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:19.469 --> 02:40:21.830]  Literally put yourself in front of the enemy.
[02:40:22.190 --> 02:40:25.272]  Put yourself right in front of those devils, and make no mistake, folks,
[02:40:25.552 --> 02:40:26.613]  They're real live devils.
[02:40:26.633 --> 02:40:27.613]  They're going to be at this event.
[02:40:27.913 --> 02:40:31.815]  Real live devils in that pit, sucking off the life force of those they killed.
[02:40:32.095 --> 02:40:34.296]  We need to be there and let them know.
[02:40:34.316 --> 02:40:45.622]  When Bush walked into that church across the street, he could hear me screaming right at him that he was a traitor and a piece of filth and that the people of the world knew that he was a minion of those that carried out the attacks.
[02:40:45.902 --> 02:40:48.543]  You must let them, at an animal level,
[02:40:49.203 --> 02:40:50.004]  We're good to go.
[02:41:01.371 --> 02:41:02.732]  We have to speak truth to power.
[02:41:02.772 --> 02:41:07.335]  The only thing stopping the destruction of America is the American people themselves.
[02:41:07.915 --> 02:41:09.616]  Show up to New York City, not 11.
[02:41:09.696 --> 02:41:10.297]  Six years.
[02:41:10.597 --> 02:41:12.478]  This is the only place to be at.
[02:41:12.518 --> 02:41:13.879]  There's no other place to be at.
[02:41:13.899 --> 02:41:14.799]  This is the one moment.
[02:41:14.839 --> 02:41:15.900]  I think this is the only chance.
[02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:18.502]  It's either now or never to take this country back.
[02:41:18.782 --> 02:41:21.043]  We have the chance now to make the wrongs right.
[02:41:21.303 --> 02:41:22.764]  Let's do it in New York City.
[02:41:22.784 --> 02:41:24.445]  Let's raise some money for the first responders.
[02:41:24.465 --> 02:41:26.086]  Let's educate as many people as we can.
[02:41:26.306 --> 02:41:27.027]  Let's motivate.
[02:41:27.107 --> 02:41:27.927]  Let's organize.
[02:41:28.148 --> 02:41:28.768]  Let's network.
[02:41:29.008 --> 02:41:32.352]  And let's create a power and force that's going to bring this New World Order down.
[02:41:32.372 --> 02:41:35.875]  And it's going to bring truth, justice, peace, and love to everybody.
[02:41:36.076 --> 02:41:37.197]  And let's do the right thing.
[02:41:37.477 --> 02:41:38.218]  Show up there.
[02:41:38.538 --> 02:41:39.880]  This is going to be a historic moment.
[02:41:39.900 --> 02:41:44.485]  You're going to be kicking yourself if you're not going to show up to New York City at Ground Zero.
[02:41:44.705 --> 02:41:45.365]  You bet, Luke.
[02:41:45.405 --> 02:41:47.167]  We'll be talking to you Thursday again on the show.
[02:41:47.187 --> 02:41:47.688]  God bless you.
[02:41:47.888 --> 02:41:48.589]  God bless you, brother.
[02:41:49.230 --> 02:42:10.901]  Now, listen to me folks, if you can't make it, family's coming into town, or you're closing on a house, or you're starting a new job next Monday, whatever the reason, you're going in to have a cancer on your back looked at or cut out, whatever's going on, the kids are sick, grandma's having surgery, I understand some of you can't make it, tell your email list about it.
[02:42:13.242 --> 02:42:15.183]  Your MySpace, call in to talk radio.
[02:42:15.623 --> 02:42:17.104]  Help us get big numbers there.
[02:42:18.627 --> 02:42:19.668]  Okay, let's go to some calls.
[02:42:19.728 --> 02:42:20.408]  Thanks for holding.
[02:42:21.869 --> 02:42:22.789]  Who's up first here?
[02:42:22.870 --> 02:42:24.130]  Nate, in Tennessee.
[02:42:24.150 --> 02:42:24.811]  Thanks for holding.
[02:42:25.051 --> 02:42:25.851]  You're a real trooper.
[02:42:25.871 --> 02:42:26.151]  Welcome.
[02:42:26.632 --> 02:42:27.392]  Hey, no problem, Alex.
[02:42:27.432 --> 02:42:28.513]  It's always great to talk with you.
[02:42:30.254 --> 02:42:30.814]  What's on your mind?
[02:42:31.655 --> 02:42:37.458]  I wanted to bring up the war with Iran, and it seems they're really kind of pushing it in a different way.
[02:42:38.579 --> 02:42:44.042]  Usually, you know, the terrorist attack precludes the war action, but now it seems like
[02:42:45.843 --> 02:42:54.081]  It's almost as if, using the example of like an abusive spouse that, you know, thinly hides their cheating and whatnot, and then when they're confronted about it, they...
[02:42:54.713 --> 02:42:58.894]  Just openly say, well yeah, this is what we're doing and we're going to do whatever we want.
[02:42:59.315 --> 02:43:06.317]  Well that's why the neocons and Republican memos and governors and the heads of parties and senators said, we need 9-11.
[02:43:06.337 --> 02:43:07.237]  9-11 helps us.
[02:43:07.537 --> 02:43:09.878]  And then they put out a report saying 9-11 was good.
[02:43:10.158 --> 02:43:10.918]  We need more.
[02:43:11.138 --> 02:43:13.539]  They may come out and say, yeah, we killed you.
[02:43:13.779 --> 02:43:15.220]  I mean, that's how evil they are.
[02:43:15.500 --> 02:43:21.862]  Yeah, well, see that's, I mean, just with Iran, it's so odd because it's almost as if they're just
[02:43:22.341 --> 02:43:37.004]  It's almost as if they're attacking this revolution of critical thought that has occurred with a large part of the American population by saying, yeah, we don't have any logical, rational reason to go to war with Iran, but we're going to do what we want, you know, whenever we want, however we want.
[02:43:37.625 --> 02:43:39.825]  And, you know, I just wanted to kind of bring that up.
[02:43:40.785 --> 02:43:51.988]  And anybody that's studied the psychology of people that do that, you know, that attitude, you know, when they finally say, yeah, we're abusive, we do whatever we want, that always precludes just
[02:43:52.426 --> 02:43:54.888]  Total insanity on the part of those people.
[02:43:55.129 --> 02:43:58.932]  I just wanted to bring that to the forefront.
[02:43:58.972 --> 02:44:04.978]  That's a sign of just total... I mean, they're going to completely open up on us if they do this, if they're allowed to do it.
[02:44:05.338 --> 02:44:06.279]  No, no, that's my point.
[02:44:06.559 --> 02:44:09.101]  This is not going to be a Cold War, and I appreciate your call, Nate.
[02:44:09.462 --> 02:44:11.844]  This is not going to be a Cold War against humanity anymore.
[02:44:13.165 --> 02:44:16.008]  They hired Mao to kill all those people.
[02:44:16.048 --> 02:44:17.129]  That's now declassified.
[02:44:17.169 --> 02:44:18.330]  Our government admits they put him in.
[02:44:19.646 --> 02:44:22.587]  They helped put the Bolsheviks in to run their ops.
[02:44:24.367 --> 02:44:29.108]  And they helped put Hitler in, the Milner Group, the British financed him the whole way, along with the U.S.
[02:44:30.948 --> 02:44:31.788]  And they do it!
[02:44:32.028 --> 02:44:37.589]  I mean, they say when they start big wars and tear things up and bring people to the edge, they get to consolidate.
[02:44:37.649 --> 02:44:39.329]  This is what all elites have done throughout history.
[02:44:39.349 --> 02:44:41.750]  They try to wage bigger wars to get more power.
[02:44:42.810 --> 02:44:47.851]  And to them, it's the excitement of life that they could go to prison, they could get caught, they could lose the war.
[02:44:48.616 --> 02:44:49.837]  A nuclear war could start?
[02:44:49.857 --> 02:44:51.558]  It makes it exciting!
[02:44:53.460 --> 02:44:54.821]  I mean, this is what they're into!
[02:44:58.664 --> 02:45:02.767]  And they've got a lot of brainwashed people out there who are not even dumb.
[02:45:02.787 --> 02:45:04.268]  A lot of police and people aren't dumb.
[02:45:04.288 --> 02:45:05.689]  They're just, they're tricked.
[02:45:05.729 --> 02:45:07.150]  They're mesmerized.
[02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:09.572]  They're like under a spell, you could say.
[02:45:12.654 --> 02:45:15.756]  And most of them are awake now.
[02:45:15.796 --> 02:45:16.557]  That's the good news.
[02:45:17.541 --> 02:45:21.724]  So the globalists now kind of need to escalate into the next level to keep it going.
[02:45:22.865 --> 02:45:33.994]  But, I mean, when they've got paid talking heads, and this has come out, and of course Congress said it was illegal, but they keep doing it, out saying martial law is good when you martial law.
[02:45:35.135 --> 02:45:37.216]  I know I said this first hour, but that is a big deal.
[02:45:37.537 --> 02:45:47.044]  And when they're signing the orders, and they're gearing up for it, I mean, maybe a year from now, thank God this hasn't happened, people will, I know, email me and say, he always says there's going to be martial law.
[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:49.580]  And it doesn't happen.
[02:45:50.941 --> 02:45:59.563]  Well, yeah, I mean, I went to urban warfare drills and watched Marines, as I've said, training to take our guns and put us in camps and admitting it, and I put a video out of it.
[02:46:01.264 --> 02:46:03.225]  And I started saying, martial law is a real danger.
[02:46:03.365 --> 02:46:04.485]  I mean, they're training for it.
[02:46:05.365 --> 02:46:12.468]  And then now they've built up this huge muscle, this huge apparatchik, this whole thing to do it, this whole weapon aimed at us.
[02:46:12.548 --> 02:46:13.688]  I mean, I don't know if they're going to do it.
[02:46:14.272 --> 02:46:15.733]  But they're sure going ahead with it.
[02:46:16.253 --> 02:46:17.573]  I've never seen such a build-up.
[02:46:17.593 --> 02:46:19.454]  I mean, it's like those aircraft carriers in the Gulf.
[02:46:20.214 --> 02:46:21.815]  And they're openly talking about hitting Iran.
[02:46:21.875 --> 02:46:22.835]  I don't know if they're going to hit them.
[02:46:23.516 --> 02:46:25.797]  But they sure are making every indication they are.
[02:46:28.798 --> 02:46:33.300]  I mean, they really are probably going to try to arrest people and take over the U.S.
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:35.280]  and literally do it.
[02:46:35.420 --> 02:46:41.723]  I mean, I just... And I guess a lot of weak-minded people are going to go along with the propaganda and others are going to be scared and serve it.
[02:46:42.350 --> 02:46:43.771]  And I've studied history.
[02:46:43.831 --> 02:46:45.311]  It's not good for people on average.
[02:46:45.651 --> 02:46:47.972]  This is going to be bad for the economy, bad for everything.
[02:46:48.012 --> 02:46:52.934]  This is just... But I guess it's entertaining for the Rothschilds and Rockefellers.
[02:46:53.534 --> 02:46:55.174]  Entertaining for Dick Cheney and Hillary.
[02:46:55.194 --> 02:46:56.775]  A bunch of power-mad nuts!
[02:46:57.475 --> 02:46:59.176]  See, normal people just want to live their lives.
[02:46:59.576 --> 02:47:00.996]  The globalists, they want total power.
[02:47:01.436 --> 02:47:03.597]  Rhonda, in North Carolina, then William.
[02:47:03.617 --> 02:47:04.437]  You're on the air, Rhonda.
[02:47:06.718 --> 02:47:07.198]  Hi, Rhonda.
[02:47:07.238 --> 02:47:07.778]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:47:09.898 --> 02:47:14.060]  Well, you were talking about standing up for what's right and fighting for what's right.
[02:47:15.861 --> 02:47:23.724]  That's exactly what I'm trying to do, but if you live in the place that I live in, for two years now, I have been trying to get help.
[02:47:25.324 --> 02:47:28.666]  Around here, you can lose somebody, a loved one.
[02:47:29.646 --> 02:47:33.528]  People don't want to put it in the paper because their houses are going to get robbed.
[02:47:34.248 --> 02:47:35.789]  And the police don't do anything.
[02:47:37.296 --> 02:47:37.696]  Nothing.
[02:47:38.157 --> 02:47:41.558]  Well, North Carolina keeps popping up for black hole behavior.
[02:47:41.578 --> 02:47:44.900]  I mean, just really weird stuff going on in North Carolina.
[02:47:44.920 --> 02:47:47.521]  Specifically, what's happened to you?
[02:47:49.302 --> 02:47:54.525]  Well, like I said, her house was broke into several times.
[02:47:55.565 --> 02:47:57.006]  She was found in her home.
[02:47:57.066 --> 02:47:57.866]  She passed away.
[02:47:57.886 --> 02:48:01.668]  I kept hearing that she didn't have any personal belongings.
[02:48:02.509 --> 02:48:06.791]  And I'm like, wait a minute, my mom didn't run around the house nude and she sure as hell always wore jewelry.
[02:48:07.935 --> 02:48:09.916]  Well, those just disappeared.
[02:48:10.176 --> 02:48:11.617]  Yeah, the cops took her stuff, yeah.
[02:48:12.317 --> 02:48:14.038]  No, it wasn't the police, actually.
[02:48:14.538 --> 02:48:16.199]  It was the funeral home.
[02:48:18.119 --> 02:48:18.900]  Well, that's what I mean.
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:23.001]  Well, I mean, I just saw the cops stealing a dead vet's guns after he died on Discovery Channel.
[02:48:23.302 --> 02:48:27.443]  And the point was, they thought it was normal to engage in crime on camera.
[02:48:27.483 --> 02:48:30.225]  But see, I mean, it's just all reached la-la land.
[02:48:30.245 --> 02:48:30.665]  Stay there.
[02:48:32.165 --> 02:48:35.907]  But I hear about this, where the funeral home or the cops or others just take whatever they want.
[02:48:37.555 --> 02:48:38.956]  It's so far gone, folks.
[02:48:39.096 --> 02:48:40.117]  So far gone.
[02:48:40.137 --> 02:48:42.058]  I just can't even tell you.
[02:48:48.683 --> 02:48:49.244]  It's here.
[02:48:49.424 --> 02:48:54.187]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.547 --> 02:49:02.173]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.887 --> 02:49:09.932]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.333 --> 02:49:21.761]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.081 --> 02:49:26.004]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.

[02:50:48.189 --> 02:50:49.830]  Hi, this is Ken Soler.

[02:51:20.444 --> 02:51:24.166]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[02:51:24.206 --> 02:51:30.710]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[02:51:30.890 --> 02:51:31.930]  Are you ready to go solar?

[02:51:47.755 --> 02:51:50.416]  Here's the headline on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:52:05.330 --> 02:52:16.254]  Protesting Bush outlawed at APEC meeting, authorities turned Sydney into prison camp, refused permission for main organizations to march, characterizing protests as an unlawful act.
[02:52:16.714 --> 02:52:19.255]  Nowhere in the city are you allowed to even say you're demonstrating.
[02:52:19.615 --> 02:52:20.455]  Boom, you're arrested.
[02:52:21.715 --> 02:52:25.357]  And that's the way it was in Montebello, and that's the way it's going to be everywhere else.
[02:52:26.057 --> 02:52:27.477]  That's the new system, folks.
[02:52:27.977 --> 02:52:29.778]  Just like in Russia, you can't protest.
[02:52:29.918 --> 02:52:31.319]  Right now, Putin has you arrested.
[02:52:31.659 --> 02:52:32.559]  They all work together.
[02:52:34.093 --> 02:52:42.415]  And the big news I wanted to get to and never really did today, and I can't even do it justice now because I want to let Rhonda and Williams have some words here.
[02:52:44.016 --> 02:52:46.036]  Edwards backs mandatory preemptive care.
[02:52:46.437 --> 02:52:49.897]  Once they get you in their clutches, they can force the vaccines and other treatments on you.
[02:52:50.998 --> 02:52:53.999]  In Russia and China and places like that, they tried to make it mandatory.
[02:52:54.039 --> 02:52:55.419]  They use it as a tool of control.
[02:52:56.919 --> 02:52:58.740]  They can then say one is obese.
[02:52:58.760 --> 02:53:01.081]  They can then tell you what you've got to eat or you're not insured.
[02:53:01.401 --> 02:53:02.201]  And here's the headline.
[02:53:03.035 --> 02:53:06.218]  Should not treat those with unhealthy lifestyles, say, Tories.
[02:53:06.258 --> 02:53:06.878]  That's in England.
[02:53:07.359 --> 02:53:07.579]  See?
[02:53:08.360 --> 02:53:09.240]  Oh, well, it's socialized.
[02:53:09.260 --> 02:53:12.803]  We're paying for you, so you can't eat this kind of meat, or you can't do that.
[02:53:14.144 --> 02:53:15.125]  It's the control.
[02:53:15.185 --> 02:53:17.107]  The big brother control it brings.
[02:53:17.147 --> 02:53:18.588]  The surveillance it brings.
[02:53:18.969 --> 02:53:19.829]  It's the nanny state.
[02:53:19.849 --> 02:53:21.431]  It's like when you sign up for Head Start now.
[02:53:21.731 --> 02:53:24.073]  Mothers don't know that means you get three CPS visits.
[02:53:24.093 --> 02:53:25.874]  Then they claim, well, now you're on the dole.
[02:53:25.994 --> 02:53:27.856]  It's about getting control of you.
[02:53:28.857 --> 02:53:31.299]  So I had about 50 other points on that, but we're out of time.
[02:53:32.402 --> 02:53:33.983]  Uh, finishing up real fast, Rhonda.
[02:53:35.223 --> 02:53:36.563]  So, where do you live in North Carolina?
[02:53:36.583 --> 02:53:38.924]  Uh, I live in Scotland County.
[02:53:39.284 --> 02:53:40.324]  And so, what ended up happening?
[02:53:40.364 --> 02:53:41.425]  Did they just take all her stuff?
[02:53:42.625 --> 02:53:51.887]  Uh, they took... The nursing home, or the funeral home, yeah, and I've got their, um, personal signature, where he signed when he got it.
[02:53:52.528 --> 02:53:54.528]  And so, she lived in the house, and what did they take?
[02:53:54.548 --> 02:53:54.588]  Um...
[02:53:58.048 --> 02:54:00.889]  The funeral home was the one that got her personal belongings.
[02:54:01.669 --> 02:54:07.090]  The house, it was the computer, television, VCR, microwave.
[02:54:09.191 --> 02:54:13.452]  Basically anything that was of any kind of value.
[02:54:14.552 --> 02:54:15.112]  Who got that?
[02:54:15.192 --> 02:54:15.672]  Who got that?
[02:54:16.913 --> 02:54:17.473]  I don't know.
[02:54:18.173 --> 02:54:19.433]  Well listen, write it up for me.
[02:54:19.473 --> 02:54:20.213]  Send me an email.
[02:54:20.233 --> 02:54:21.694]  Send it to erininfowars.com.
[02:54:21.714 --> 02:54:23.694]  Maybe I'll have you or somebody on as a guest.
[02:54:23.754 --> 02:54:24.534]  Listen, listen.
[02:54:26.115 --> 02:54:27.095]  Families are gone.
[02:54:28.780 --> 02:54:34.604]  And there's a lot of people, there's a lot of these yuppies who are going to end up with no children when they're 75, 80 years old.
[02:54:35.324 --> 02:54:37.345]  And they're just going to be euthanized by them.
[02:54:38.466 --> 02:54:41.388]  And I'm glad you're a neighbor that cared about her.
[02:54:41.408 --> 02:54:42.088]  See, that's not good.
[02:54:42.108 --> 02:54:42.969]  You're not supposed to care.
[02:54:43.829 --> 02:54:46.131]  You're just supposed to ignore the fact this kind of stuff goes on.
[02:54:46.591 --> 02:54:49.733]  And just watch your television set, don't even know your neighbors.
[02:54:50.859 --> 02:54:53.181]  We're literally being taken into the Matrix right now.
[02:54:53.221 --> 02:54:55.864]  This is how we're getting inserted into the Matrix.
[02:54:56.284 --> 02:55:00.128]  Seduced by the television, not talking to people anymore, not using language.
[02:55:01.209 --> 02:55:03.250]  It's very sick what's happening.
[02:55:04.151 --> 02:55:06.013]  William in Florida, last caller, go ahead.
[02:55:06.173 --> 02:55:08.015]  Hello sir, I really appreciate your program.
[02:55:08.715 --> 02:55:15.622]  Briefly I'd like to mention that I just finished reading a book called Soldiers of Misfortune by a Mark Schrader Avon publication.
[02:55:16.383 --> 02:55:18.164]  The book is endorsed by U.S.
[02:55:18.204 --> 02:55:20.146]  General Westmoreland, who passed away recently.
[02:55:20.186 --> 02:55:21.227]  He was in charge of all U.S.
[02:55:21.287 --> 02:55:23.809]  military forces in Vietnam.
[02:55:24.549 --> 02:55:29.933]  He said that every American needs to read this book called Soldiers of Misfortune in order to stay free.
[02:55:30.014 --> 02:55:31.775]  It should be in every library.
[02:55:31.995 --> 02:55:33.536]  What does the book say?
[02:55:34.077 --> 02:55:38.020]  The book says, it talks about the capture of 24,000 American soldiers after World War II.
[02:55:40.942 --> 02:55:44.965]  Oh yeah, it's the big book out about leaving soldiers behind, yeah.
[02:55:45.305 --> 02:55:45.846]  Right.
[02:55:46.346 --> 02:55:46.946]  I'm out of time.
[02:55:46.966 --> 02:55:48.127]  Call me back tomorrow about it.
[02:55:48.427 --> 02:55:51.189]  In fact, I remember hearing about that book and meaning to get the authors on.
[02:55:51.749 --> 02:55:52.190]  Oh yeah.
[02:55:52.710 --> 02:55:55.131]  I mean, for cops and military, let me tell you something.
[02:55:55.592 --> 02:55:58.634]  You get left behind, they could care less about you.
[02:55:59.234 --> 02:56:01.115]  You're lower than pawns come to them.
[02:56:01.896 --> 02:56:06.639]  And if it isn't, I mean, they'll make some guy who's captured a hero out of there wanting to demonize somebody.
[02:56:06.919 --> 02:56:08.500]  But when a war is over and they're pulling out,
[02:56:09.415 --> 02:56:12.977]  Uh, the Russians got, yeah, it was 22,000, 24,000.
[02:56:13.057 --> 02:56:16.418]  They debate the number, and our government just said, Ha!
[02:56:16.738 --> 02:56:17.719]  Keep them as slaves!
[02:56:17.839 --> 02:56:18.539]  Ha, ha, ha!
[02:56:18.739 --> 02:56:19.840]  That's mainstream news!
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:20.700]  Just take them!
[02:56:20.780 --> 02:56:21.761]  Ha, ha, ha!
[02:56:22.161 --> 02:56:23.742]  Imagine how evil the government is now!
