[00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:09.725]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:11.186]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.947 --> 00:00:13.848]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:17.411]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.692 --> 00:00:21.795]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.922]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:42.183 --> 00:00:45.005]  It's already Tuesday, the ninth day of October, 2007.
[00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:49.588]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:59.496]  Headline from Jerome Corsi, WorldNetDaily, the New World Disorder section, Bush backs Mexico rapist murderer.
[00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:03.600]  International Court seeks to block death penalty in Texas.
[00:01:06.642 --> 00:01:10.423]  Also, expanding on that, here's a headline from NBC News.
[00:01:10.663 --> 00:01:17.306]  Non-North California farmers worry fruit will rot on trees.
[00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:20.367]  And so the propaganda goes.
[00:01:20.387 --> 00:01:23.388]  And we're going to be covering this first today and then a bunch of other important news.
[00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:29.811]  I had seen over the weekend and yesterday morning and afternoon
[00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:40.174]  Scores of news stories saying food prices are skyrocketing because illegal aliens are being deported.
[00:01:41.775 --> 00:01:49.458]  And I knew instantly that it was a fraud, I had the numbers, I knew why it was a fraud, but he didn't really consciously outrage me.
[00:01:50.419 --> 00:02:00.383]  And then Weldon Henson in the back office was sitting there doing some customer service and he looked up and he said, you know I was watching NASCAR Sunday
[00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:07.205]  And they just cut into it, never before done this, with an ABC special report.
[00:02:07.325 --> 00:02:08.086]  Pure propaganda.
[00:02:08.106 --> 00:02:10.448]  They're trying to target people who don't normally watch the news.
[00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:12.690]  Or watch a lot of it.
[00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.515]  And they said, uh, food prices exploding because of immigrants being deported.
[00:02:20.797 --> 00:02:22.638]  And Weldon said, it's total propaganda.
[00:02:22.658 --> 00:02:24.260]  The dollar's been devalued.
[00:02:25.346 --> 00:02:31.054]  And if you read the actual financial papers, they admit that's why food prices are skyrocketing.
[00:02:31.114 --> 00:02:38.364]  But see, by the time they're done spinning and lying, and believe me, when ABC put that out, they knew they were lying.
[00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.271]  And I've never seen such wall-to-wall illegal alien worship in my life.
[00:02:46.451 --> 00:03:03.675]  I mean, I walked into the office this morning, and we got a couple televisions in the back, and they're both on, and it's illegal alien tear-jerking, oh, their mommies got taken from their children, boo-hoo, and Vicente Fox shooting his mouth off about how we're all racist up here in America.
[00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:05.496]  Shut up, Fox!
[00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:06.336]  You're the racist.
[00:03:06.356 --> 00:03:07.016]  You're government.
[00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:13.146]  Is all about two feet taller than your slaves that you call cockroaches.
[00:03:13.647 --> 00:03:15.308]  You call your people cockroaches.
[00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.531]  You can't buy property down there.
[00:03:20.112 --> 00:03:22.013]  They don't want the gringos down there.
[00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:24.355]  It's virulently anti-American down there.
[00:03:24.715 --> 00:03:28.038]  And we're just not going to play along with your fraud anymore!
[00:03:28.198 --> 00:03:29.359]  Your political correctness!
[00:03:30.532 --> 00:03:37.074]  The American people were sprayed with this political correctness and kind of dizzy and numb for a while, but it isn't working anymore!
[00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.895]  We're not intimidated, you racist pig!
[00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:40.815]  Shut up!
[00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:42.495]  Shut up, scum!
[00:03:45.176 --> 00:03:48.017]  The New World Order wants to bring this country down!
[00:03:49.937 --> 00:03:51.838]  And I'm not going to stand by and watch it!
[00:03:52.978 --> 00:03:55.379]  And the American people aren't going to watch it anymore, radar.
[00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:59.500]  And we don't care what you say about us, and we don't care what you do!
[00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.311]  We've only begun to fight!
[00:04:02.331 --> 00:04:05.434]  I didn't mean to get mad this early in the broadcast.
[00:04:05.514 --> 00:04:07.456]  I'm just so sick of Vicente Fox.
[00:04:07.717 --> 00:04:09.919]  I mean, he looks like a caricature of the devil.
[00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:18.947]  And I'm sick of George Bush and Hillary Clinton, that piece of filth, just running around doing whatever they want to this country.
[00:04:18.968 --> 00:04:22.411]  Alright, I gotta settle down.
[00:04:28.248 --> 00:04:44.835]  I mean, we see the billboard saying this is Mexico, we listen to the Mexican radio laughing and giggling and snickering and talking about bringing the country down, we hear it, we read it, we're not stupid, and we're not going to act like we don't see it, and we're not going to act like we don't know who the real racists are.
[00:04:45.075 --> 00:04:45.415]  Okay?
[00:04:45.615 --> 00:04:46.196]  It's over!
[00:04:46.676 --> 00:04:48.196]  The mincing words is over!
[00:04:48.717 --> 00:04:52.378]  You've declared war on this country, and now you're going to get a fight!
[00:04:52.698 --> 00:04:53.879]  Do you understand?
[00:05:01.557 --> 00:05:06.522]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[00:05:06.822 --> 00:05:12.267]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:05:12.307 --> 00:05:16.591]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:19.954]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:05:20.254 --> 00:05:23.697]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[00:05:24.017 --> 00:05:33.360]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.121]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[00:06:04.538 --> 00:06:09.304]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:09.685 --> 00:06:17.295]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.007 --> 00:06:25.050]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:36.855]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.195 --> 00:06:41.016]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.116 --> 00:06:43.377]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.437 --> 00:06:47.259]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:00.623 --> 00:07:08.105]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry, and I'm a plastic surgeon, and I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.
[00:07:08.285 --> 00:07:10.766]  But I want to tell you today about a product that I developed.
[00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:16.987]  It's called Night Skin, and it helps your skin look younger without needles, without acid peels, and without a facelift.

[00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:26.510]  And in 12 hours, it will promote elastin growth in your skin.
[00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:27.571]  What does this all mean?
[00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:32.194]  Well, this is the stuff that makes your skin firm and healthy and helps you look younger.

[00:07:51.507 --> 00:07:51.707]  That's 1-800-894-3462.
[00:07:51.727 --> 00:07:52.688]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:52.708 --> 00:07:53.989]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:54.589]  Another reason I blew up.
[00:08:11.835 --> 00:08:15.901]  In the first two minutes of the show, and believe me, I don't like blowing up anymore.
[00:08:15.981 --> 00:08:17.403]  It tires me out later in the day.
[00:08:17.423 --> 00:08:24.473]  It's because the Austin American Statesman, they had a big Campo board meeting in North Austin last night.
[00:08:26.281 --> 00:08:28.662]  And they don't ever allow citizens communication at these.
[00:08:28.682 --> 00:08:31.403]  They always let you sign up a week before and then they cancel it.
[00:08:31.843 --> 00:08:33.704]  And these crooks sit up there on the board.
[00:08:34.424 --> 00:08:38.185]  And they swore that, oh, no new toll roads in Texas.
[00:08:38.265 --> 00:08:44.087]  We know it says 8,000 miles in the TxDOT documents are going to be handed over to the foreign Spanish company.
[00:08:44.767 --> 00:08:47.708]  But we swear, and there's been a moratorium, no new toll roads.
[00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:50.810]  Headline, Toll Road Plan Cruises Onward.
[00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.811]  And it says that they're going to take almost every major road in Austin
[00:08:56.278 --> 00:08:57.881]  And this is going nationwide, by the way.
[00:08:57.921 --> 00:09:00.004]  We're just deeper in the rat hole than most of you.
[00:09:00.925 --> 00:09:06.274]  And, uh, they're gonna put them on existing roads in Mopac, 360, 183, just everything.
[00:09:12.294 --> 00:09:14.735]  290.
[00:09:12.394 --> 00:09:14.735]  I mean, the list goes on and on and on.
[00:09:15.375 --> 00:09:19.856]  And then no one even remembers that three months ago they swore and called this conspiracy theory.
[00:09:19.876 --> 00:09:22.477]  See, it's a military operation.
[00:09:22.537 --> 00:09:27.419]  They neutralize our building movement by pacifying and saying, okay, you won.
[00:09:27.939 --> 00:09:30.940]  And then the public still hasn't figured out that they're congenital criminals.
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.180]  They just completely lie.
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.141]  So we were ranting and raving about that.
[00:09:36.093 --> 00:09:46.398]  And television 24 hours a day is the poor, sweet illegals that love America and care about the country and they're so dear and sweet and they wouldn't hurt a fly and the evil Americans want to hurt them.
[00:09:47.398 --> 00:09:52.041]  I mean, you shoot your mouth off in Mexico, the Mexican police will beat you to death.
[00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:57.383]  They'll drag you off to a dirt-bottom jail and suck every bit of money out of your family before they let you out.
[00:09:58.024 --> 00:09:59.844]  They won't let you buy property down there.
[00:10:00.645 --> 00:10:05.287]  You run up an American flag in Mexico, I bet within an hour you're going to be in jail if you're lucky.
[00:10:05.862 --> 00:10:07.244]  Probably beat to death in the street.
[00:10:07.664 --> 00:10:09.666]  There's no country on earth that hates the U.S.
[00:10:09.886 --> 00:10:10.647]  more than Mexico.
[00:10:10.847 --> 00:10:12.649]  We won two wars against them.
[00:10:12.849 --> 00:10:13.790]  They hate us.
[00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:18.815]  And you've got all these stupid yuppies stumbling around that don't know which end is up.
[00:10:19.676 --> 00:10:21.538]  They don't monitor the Spanish media.
[00:10:24.247 --> 00:10:43.754]  And I hate this whole situation, because there are great Hispanic Americans, almost 70% in major polls, don't want the borders open, they know the illegal aliens are driving down the wages, they know they're Lurie Conquista that, kill the gringo this, they know it makes them be between a rock and a hard place, I don't like this, I want to live in peace!
[00:10:46.055 --> 00:10:46.575]  Believe me!
[00:10:48.336 --> 00:10:48.636]  Okay?
[00:10:49.483 --> 00:10:54.507]  I don't go into a building and go, oh my God, they're Mexicans, I don't want to be here.
[00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:59.711]  I mean, I like Mexican food, I like Mexicans.
[00:11:00.431 --> 00:11:02.873]  Before I was married, I think senoritas are very pretty.
[00:11:03.354 --> 00:11:12.721]  The point here is that I don't like people here telling me I don't belong and I'm bad and I'm scum, and then the media acts like they're not saying it.
[00:11:14.016 --> 00:11:16.198]  The media acts like this isn't going on.
[00:11:16.578 --> 00:11:21.022]  The media acts like we're supposed to play along with this, like this isn't happening.
[00:11:24.725 --> 00:11:25.745]  This is a sick joke.
[00:11:28.107 --> 00:11:31.370]  Now, I want to play this clip because this is the full court press.
[00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.891]  This is how dumb they think you are.
[00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:41.278]  They're saying that the food prices are exploding because we don't have the illegal aliens to pick the crops.
[00:11:42.805 --> 00:11:43.946]  A, that's a lie.
[00:11:44.266 --> 00:11:45.567]  It's the dollar that's been devalued.
[00:11:46.067 --> 00:11:48.969]  But B, they haven't arrested the illegal aliens.
[00:11:49.689 --> 00:11:55.752]  They've arrested thirty-something thousand in the first nine months of this year.
[00:11:55.892 --> 00:11:58.834]  That's out of three million plus illegals a year coming in?
[00:11:59.334 --> 00:12:00.195]  A million legal?
[00:12:00.995 --> 00:12:04.457]  Thirty-something thousand out of four million?
[00:12:04.497 --> 00:12:06.078]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[00:12:06.458 --> 00:12:07.379]  It's nothing!
[00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:10.200]  And all these newscasts, they're getting tough!
[00:12:10.221 --> 00:12:10.981]  They're getting tough!
[00:12:11.795 --> 00:12:17.477]  Well, you ever get your arm or leg cut off and your blood's spraying off, your light's coursing out of your body in big red founts?
[00:12:19.978 --> 00:12:23.500]  You just stick a band-aid on there and you tell yourself you're getting tough on the amputation.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.281]  It's not even a band-aid on a severed leg.
[00:12:28.561 --> 00:12:28.862]  Okay?
[00:12:31.363 --> 00:12:33.643]  And this country is inches from being dead.
[00:12:33.683 --> 00:12:35.424]  The dollar is in free fall.
[00:12:35.904 --> 00:12:40.226]  There are foreigners who hate our guts running around, just spitting all over us.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.162]  We're gonna be a peon third world nation like Mexico.
[00:12:48.104 --> 00:12:50.465]  And, well, this is what got me set off.
[00:12:50.825 --> 00:12:54.668]  I've been noticing this, and again, I got mad at myself because I consciously hadn't registered it.
[00:12:54.928 --> 00:13:00.931]  Weldon, you were watching NASCAR Sunday, and tell folks what you saw, and then Tim was watching the news last night.
[00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:04.733]  People get a feel of just the full-court press that's going on right now.
[00:13:05.254 --> 00:13:05.514]  Weldon?
[00:13:06.255 --> 00:13:08.377]  Yeah, I was watching the race Sunday.
[00:13:08.397 --> 00:13:13.362]  It's the only time I get to watch TV, but they didn't really cut the race off, but they usually have a post-race for about 30 minutes.
[00:13:13.882 --> 00:13:18.046]  Well, it was right after it was over and, you know, right on ABC World News Tonight.
[00:13:18.106 --> 00:13:18.807]  Yeah, that's what you said.
[00:13:18.827 --> 00:13:20.088]  They mean they cut off the post-race.
[00:13:20.128 --> 00:13:21.630]  Yeah, they don't do that.
[00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.894]  Mainstream news, the headline tonight, rising food costs, you know, da-da-da-da.
[00:13:26.695 --> 00:13:27.996]  And why is the reason?
[00:13:28.097 --> 00:13:33.664]  They say because there's a shortage of illegal immigrant workers to pick the fruits and harvest the crops.
[00:13:33.724 --> 00:13:35.847]  I mean right there that was the headline.
[00:13:36.188 --> 00:13:40.434]  There they go in that's talking to all a bunch of farmers talking about how they don't have enough workers.
[00:13:41.115 --> 00:13:41.996]  I just didn't fall for it.
[00:13:42.116 --> 00:13:50.238]  Now, see, I mean, that works so well, though, because you've got 45 million people conservatively watching NASCAR on any given day.
[00:13:50.618 --> 00:13:52.319]  60, 70 million in the championship race.
[00:13:52.359 --> 00:13:54.820]  I didn't see the ratings for this, but at least 45 million.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.560]  They're not, on average, you know, big news junkies.
[00:13:58.001 --> 00:14:05.983]  And so they're hearing, well, my food's going up, because the precious little illegals that miffed when they haven't even arrested the farm workers.
[00:14:06.583 --> 00:14:09.125]  And they hand out the green cards to the farm workers.
[00:14:09.165 --> 00:14:11.427]  You can get them out of a Cracker Jack box, basically.
[00:14:11.447 --> 00:14:12.988]  But, Weldon, you immediately saw through it.
[00:14:13.028 --> 00:14:15.289]  Tell them what really caused it to go up.
[00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:16.931]  It's simple.
[00:14:17.091 --> 00:14:18.051]  The dollar's deflating.
[00:14:18.852 --> 00:14:21.014]  It's not worth anything, to be honest with you.
[00:14:21.034 --> 00:14:23.135]  But that was just pretty crazy.
[00:14:23.155 --> 00:14:27.498]  You hear about all the lies that the government and the news propaganda.
[00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:31.501]  And every now and then, you really come across something that just really blows you away.
[00:14:31.521 --> 00:14:32.222]  And this was it, man.
[00:14:36.132 --> 00:14:36.633]  I think so.
[00:14:47.185 --> 00:14:48.546]  I know I'm going to hear that at church.
[00:14:48.586 --> 00:14:49.687]  I know I'm going to hear that on the street.
[00:14:49.707 --> 00:14:51.509]  I know I'm going to hear that on other talk radio shows.
[00:14:51.529 --> 00:14:52.349]  I always hear that.
[00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:53.550]  Oh, come on.
[00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:54.871]  We need them for the economy.
[00:14:54.951 --> 00:14:57.153]  We need them to pick the strawberries.
[00:14:57.173 --> 00:14:59.055]  I'm going to have to hear it when I talk to people about it, too.
[00:14:59.075 --> 00:15:09.363]  And so now, Redneck America was watching this, and they're going to think now that it's not the New World Order.
[00:15:09.403 --> 00:15:10.444]  It's not the Federal Reserve.
[00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:12.765]  It's the precious little illegal aliens.
[00:15:13.126 --> 00:15:14.647]  That's why your food prices went up.
[00:15:15.356 --> 00:15:16.196]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:16.417 --> 00:15:21.199]  And they were talking about, they were interviewing these farmers about how they need to try to get them visas and all this and that.
[00:15:21.999 --> 00:15:24.561]  But it's outrageous propaganda.
[00:15:24.581 --> 00:15:25.161]  That's all it is.
[00:15:25.281 --> 00:15:26.321]  That's all it comes down to.
[00:15:26.381 --> 00:15:30.163]  It's just a trick to trick Americans into going along with their system.
[00:15:31.624 --> 00:15:34.906]  Shifting gears, and we're going to keep you guys on and get more into the immigration issue.
[00:15:35.346 --> 00:15:37.507]  Toll road plan cruises forward
[00:15:38.434 --> 00:15:40.298]  And hundreds of people show up.
[00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:41.120]  None of them want it.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.625]  They just swore a few months ago there were no new toll roads.
[00:15:44.447 --> 00:15:46.712]  And now they've done it.
[00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:48.449]  Tim was there last night.
[00:15:48.649 --> 00:15:49.510]  Tim, tell us what you saw.
[00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.610]  Yeah, I was up there last night for about an hour.
[00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.451]  It was just, I don't know, I couldn't take it.
[00:15:55.471 --> 00:16:00.733]  I've been to so many of these meetings and I know they're just going to ram it through anyways.
[00:16:01.353 --> 00:16:02.333]  It was just disgusting.
[00:16:02.393 --> 00:16:10.795]  I could see all these people with their hats on that were in support of the toll roads and they're saying, well, it'll cut down on traffic and I just don't understand that.
[00:16:10.815 --> 00:16:15.297]  I mean, how is it going to cut down on traffic if you put toll roads on existing roads?
[00:16:15.597 --> 00:16:16.717]  Well, it's worse than that.
[00:16:17.419 --> 00:16:18.980]  I want to get back to what you were saying, Alex.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.462]  I stay in touch with the board director for CAMPO, Senator Kurt Watson.
[00:16:24.482 --> 00:16:29.003]  I get his emails back and forth, as well as with the toll party, people that were against the toll roads.
[00:16:29.904 --> 00:16:41.388]  It was as early as, man, you know, a month ago, I received an email that Senator Kurt Watson stated phase two of the toll roads is off the shelf.
[00:16:41.468 --> 00:16:42.368]  It's off the table.
[00:16:42.888 --> 00:16:43.969]  You know, right there in front of you.
[00:16:43.989 --> 00:16:44.769]  It's right in my email.
[00:16:45.385 --> 00:16:48.747]  And if you bring that up, he'll just smile and say, did you see a black helicopter?
[00:16:48.767 --> 00:16:49.188]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:50.368]  I mean, that's their answer to everything.
[00:17:01.977 --> 00:17:04.678]  You know, I'm not one to just jump on to things real easy.
[00:17:04.718 --> 00:17:16.141]  I do a lot of research, but man, when people lie to you right in your face... You know, you take that email you've got in your box, send it to Paul Watson, or maybe Aaron can do it, or maybe you guys can put it together, and just a blurb about Kirk Watson lying.
[00:17:16.181 --> 00:17:17.982]  See, they... I mean, it was all over the news.
[00:17:18.022 --> 00:17:19.202]  They said there were no more toll roads.
[00:17:19.742 --> 00:17:24.324]  I mean, every time we show up and say no, they say, okay, we won't do it, and then they're building them right now.
[00:17:24.344 --> 00:17:25.564]  They're putting the toll roads in.
[00:17:25.964 --> 00:17:28.965]  They got all these propaganda ads running that buys off the media.
[00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:31.606]  It makes me sick, not only that they will lie, but
[00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:34.831]  There's people out there that read that and they just think, well, oh well.
[00:17:35.312 --> 00:17:36.092]  I don't understand that.
[00:17:36.112 --> 00:17:36.912]  People need to wake up.
[00:17:36.932 --> 00:17:42.175]  They need to start paying attention that if someone lies to you, you can't trust them with anything else that they do.
[00:17:42.355 --> 00:17:42.955]  Bottom line.
[00:17:44.656 --> 00:17:55.861]  This country is a bunch of fat, stupid, happy, spoiled brats who have no idea that a crew of wolves is running things and literally building FEMA camps when we do stand up.
[00:17:55.922 --> 00:18:00.804]  I mean, these people have no idea how sick it's gotten.
[00:18:01.384 --> 00:18:03.526]  Tim, back to the immigration issue.
[00:18:03.546 --> 00:18:09.232]  You said that you saw just an incredible attack last night against the mayor of Irving up in Dallas.
[00:18:09.652 --> 00:18:14.897]  Yeah, it was on, I believe the show is Frank Sanchez or something like that on CNN.
[00:18:16.199 --> 00:18:23.366]  But right off the bat, he was just attacking this guy, accusing him of using racist tactics.
[00:18:24.066 --> 00:18:27.747]  And all the mayor was saying is that the police are doing their jobs.
[00:18:27.807 --> 00:18:32.768]  If they get pulled over for a traffic stop and they don't have an ID, they're being arrested.
[00:18:33.268 --> 00:18:39.709]  Well, once they're in the system, I guess they're working with ICE up in Irving, and ICE comes in and deports them.
[00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:42.190]  But now it's causing a big thing.
[00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.070]  Well, look, it's simple.
[00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.991]  One of my employees in this parking lot got arrested.
[00:18:46.011 --> 00:18:47.311]  He's actually a contractor.
[00:18:47.331 --> 00:18:47.991]  Got arrested.
[00:18:48.591 --> 00:18:51.932]  I pull up and there's cop cars because he didn't have a
[00:18:53.755 --> 00:18:54.997]  In date driver's license.
[00:18:55.839 --> 00:18:57.241]  And they do it all the time.
[00:18:57.261 --> 00:18:58.403]  They arrest you for no seatbelt.
[00:18:58.823 --> 00:19:04.753]  But then again, I've had police chiefs on this show, they've been in the media where they're told don't arrest illegals for drunk driving.
[00:19:05.414 --> 00:19:06.356]  I mean, come on, man!
[00:19:10.402 --> 00:19:12.084]  No, you say he was trying to set him up on the show.
[00:19:12.284 --> 00:19:16.528]  Yeah, he was, it was just, he kept on putting, trying to put words in his mouth.
[00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:20.852]  I wish I were to record it so we could put it up, but it was just disgusting.
[00:19:20.992 --> 00:19:26.417]  I mean, I was really, started getting angry because I could just see this propaganda.
[00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:31.822]  They were just trying to make it seem like it wasn't illegal for them to be here when
[00:19:32.979 --> 00:19:33.679]  It is illegal.
[00:19:33.699 --> 00:19:34.579]  Well, it's a rigged game.
[00:19:34.619 --> 00:19:38.780]  It's like we're gladiators, and they've thrown us into the pit, and we don't have a helmet, a sword, a shield.
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:44.001]  The enemy's in full armor, and then they're even telling us that we're not even allowed to admit we're under attack.
[00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:52.203]  I mean, that guy on CNN knows full well the radio's all, we're gonna get him, we're taking over, ha ha ha, this is Mexico, ha ha ha, the dumb gringo.
[00:19:52.603 --> 00:19:55.463]  I mean, look, brother, the word's out, we're gonna talk about it.
[00:19:55.763 --> 00:19:59.104]  You're not gonna just spew your racism and get away with it without us exposing it.

[00:21:01.218 --> 00:21:02.559]  Ted Anders from Midas, October 9, 2007.

[00:21:14.185 --> 00:21:20.989]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[00:21:21.049 --> 00:21:25.412]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan revolution.
[00:21:25.772 --> 00:21:34.421]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[00:21:34.441 --> 00:21:37.123]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[00:21:37.403 --> 00:21:41.347]  Russia, Switzerland and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[00:21:41.548 --> 00:21:48.094]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.

[00:22:02.375 --> 00:22:04.437]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:05.058 --> 00:22:13.988]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.449 --> 00:22:21.637]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?

[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.482]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:03.622 --> 00:23:08.806]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:23:08.986 --> 00:23:10.327]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:23:10.587 --> 00:23:18.774]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:18.994 --> 00:23:24.779]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:24.899 --> 00:23:26.660]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.842]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:23:29.022 --> 00:23:33.267]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:23:33.427 --> 00:23:35.610]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:23:43.899 --> 00:23:44.239]  We're good.
[00:24:14.265 --> 00:24:15.806]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:24:15.926 --> 00:24:17.946]  I was just looking.
[00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.412]  At the front page, the Austin American Statesman, and how pathetic it is.
[00:24:45.252 --> 00:24:53.037]  Congress expected the yield on wiretaps, unlimited, non-warranted, no-warrant wiretaps against the American people.
[00:24:53.478 --> 00:25:00.022]  Bush administration, confident Democrats won't curb its broad intelligence-gathering powers.
[00:25:00.082 --> 00:25:00.562]  Of course not.
[00:25:01.282 --> 00:25:02.483]  They work for the same globalists.
[00:25:03.844 --> 00:25:04.965]  Then you've got toll roads.
[00:25:06.317 --> 00:25:09.879]  They announced five more, but we have the official Text.Maps.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.341]  It's going to be every major road in Austin.
[00:25:13.222 --> 00:25:14.723]  We're talking about William Cannon.
[00:25:14.743 --> 00:25:16.084]  We're talking about Lamar.
[00:25:16.924 --> 00:25:18.345]  We're talking about Congress.
[00:25:18.405 --> 00:25:21.768]  We're talking about every road.
[00:25:22.948 --> 00:25:24.289]  We've known this for five years.
[00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:30.233]  And then every time they get to a new stage of it, they say, no, no, no, no, as they put them in.
[00:25:30.554 --> 00:25:32.695]  We will never put toll roads on Mopac.
[00:25:32.855 --> 00:25:33.956]  And then they announce they're doing it.
[00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:36.727]  Well, it was in the text.documents.
[00:25:36.767 --> 00:25:37.508]  Of course they are.
[00:25:39.009 --> 00:25:41.011]  They've already sold out to Centra folks.
[00:25:41.771 --> 00:25:50.358]  They've got ads in every magazine, every newspaper I see, every TV channel, every radio channel, all over Texas.
[00:25:50.418 --> 00:25:52.200]  It's the same thing in Indiana, New Jersey.
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.381]  It's happening everywhere.
[00:25:53.881 --> 00:25:58.084]  California, Ohio, Florida, everywhere.
[00:25:59.185 --> 00:26:01.307]  Those are also payoffs to the media.
[00:26:02.148 --> 00:26:02.408]  You see?
[00:26:04.304 --> 00:26:09.327]  You're like, why are there these text tag ads everywhere, even in cities where they haven't put toll roads in yet?
[00:26:09.407 --> 00:26:10.708]  It's a payoff for the media!
[00:26:14.831 --> 00:26:17.973]  Then it talks about toll troubles cause double headaches.
[00:26:18.573 --> 00:26:22.216]  It says the RFID scanners keep double charging everyone.
[00:26:22.236 --> 00:26:25.398]  Oh, it says double billing.
[00:26:27.139 --> 00:26:28.900]  They've double billed as many as 50,000 people.
[00:26:31.056 --> 00:26:34.697]  Oh, and they say they just can't fix it, but you've gotta pay.
[00:26:34.717 --> 00:26:37.939]  I mean, there's no end to the raping.
[00:26:40.239 --> 00:26:42.760]  But don't worry, it says, Cowboys Folk Hero.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:50.263]  And then it says, 10-year war over Penske waste may soon be over.
[00:26:51.835 --> 00:26:55.476]  And it says, state law makes consumption cut a top priority.
[00:26:55.916 --> 00:27:04.679]  It says because of the global warming man-made footprint, we have to come in with new regulations, taxation, control of what government does.
[00:27:05.659 --> 00:27:07.020]  That just means raising prices.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.820]  So we've got that here in Texas.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.561]  I mean, this is just an example.
[00:27:12.161 --> 00:27:14.682]  And then there's another story about how great Che Guevara is.
[00:27:15.282 --> 00:27:18.123]  And for communists, I mean, he is one of the better ones.
[00:27:18.323 --> 00:27:19.123]  He meant well.
[00:27:19.583 --> 00:27:21.484]  That's why Fidel kicked him out and they had him killed.
[00:27:22.521 --> 00:27:25.062]  Old Cuba let him know right where he was at so they could go kill him.
[00:27:25.102 --> 00:27:27.764]  But still, the point is, here they are worshipping Che Guevara.
[00:27:27.784 --> 00:27:31.946]  I mean, that's the cover of the Statesman.
[00:27:32.627 --> 00:27:38.710]  You can open it up and, um... It's just the total destruction of our society.
[00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.651]  That's all it is.
[00:27:41.972 --> 00:27:50.016]  And then we've got the propaganda about how if we don't legalize all the illegal aliens, prices are gonna explode.
[00:27:51.337 --> 00:28:03.480]  Prices are exploding because the owners of this country, the Federal Reserve, have massively, massively devalued the dollar.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.460]  And it's going to get worse.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:16.603]  And you're going to have to look at your dim-eyed co-workers, literally you can hear a BB rolling around inside their hollow heads, look at you with great satisfaction of their intellectual prowess and say,
[00:28:17.783 --> 00:28:27.608]  Oh Bill, or hey Carol, notice you're against legalizing all the immigrants, and that's why the hamburger's $10 now instead of $5.
[00:28:29.609 --> 00:28:31.309]  And you can't even argue with them.
[00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:32.250]  They don't care.
[00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.091]  They want to be slaves.
[00:28:34.511 --> 00:28:36.152]  They like being stupid.
[00:28:37.072 --> 00:28:40.193]  They like always being gamed and scammed and beat.
[00:28:41.334 --> 00:28:43.335]  They like their children being slaves.
[00:28:43.435 --> 00:28:45.316]  They like being simple-minded oafs.
[00:28:51.454 --> 00:28:55.698]  Dr. Corsi joins us to talk about this whole situation here in a few minutes.
[00:28:55.958 --> 00:28:57.239]  He'll pop in in 10-15 minutes.
[00:28:57.799 --> 00:29:10.990]  Tom Cryer, the lawyer who, with another constitutional law scholar, beat the IRS a few months ago.
[00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.172]  He'll be popping in to talk about the Adelaide Brown case.
[00:29:13.412 --> 00:29:15.714]  There have been big developments there I haven't even gotten into.
[00:29:15.734 --> 00:29:19.377]  They're running around interrogating and threatening people all over New Hampshire.
[00:29:23.792 --> 00:29:27.794]  Meanwhile, Chertoff's all over TV claiming they've built hundreds of miles of fence.
[00:29:27.814 --> 00:29:28.674]  They built a few miles.
[00:29:29.594 --> 00:29:31.475]  He's running with illegal aliens building it, by the way.
[00:29:32.015 --> 00:29:34.136]  He's running around claiming they've really gotten tough.
[00:29:34.156 --> 00:29:35.457]  This is what it looks like to get tough.
[00:29:37.458 --> 00:29:38.398]  So it's all coming up.
[00:29:38.418 --> 00:29:40.639]  I haven't even scratched the surface of the news today.
[00:29:40.659 --> 00:29:44.901]  I'm going to play you a sampling of the propaganda.
[00:29:46.021 --> 00:29:48.962]  Your food costs more because there's no illegals to pick it.
[00:29:51.377 --> 00:29:54.361]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.381 --> 00:29:57.986]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.319 --> 00:30:03.279]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:30:03.299 --> 00:30:05.880]  I'm with the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.001]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax NutraCyticals U.S.
[00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:09.721]  is a real thing.
[00:30:09.801 --> 00:30:16.703]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:30:16.803 --> 00:30:22.085]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[00:30:22.265 --> 00:30:23.006]  We're good to go!
[00:30:49.065 --> 00:30:52.808]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[00:30:53.529 --> 00:30:57.852]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[00:30:58.013 --> 00:31:00.835]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:31:01.536 --> 00:31:04.098]  Hemp, the superfood for you and your family.
[00:31:04.498 --> 00:31:07.741]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[00:31:08.251 --> 00:31:08.511]  Hemp.
[00:31:08.931 --> 00:31:11.652]  Used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[00:31:12.032 --> 00:31:12.312]  Hemp.
[00:31:12.652 --> 00:31:19.134]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[00:31:19.474 --> 00:31:22.715]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[00:31:22.995 --> 00:31:26.476]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[00:31:26.496 --> 00:31:26.876]  I think so.

[00:32:07.406 --> 00:32:11.847]  Do not rely on someone else to come through for you at a time when it could be about life and death.

[00:33:01.723 --> 00:33:17.418]  If you like to gamble, I'll tell you how to play.
[00:33:17.538 --> 00:33:21.782]  You win, don't lose, only do as they say.
[00:33:30.961 --> 00:33:41.552]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:41.592 --> 00:33:51.122]  You are here, the front line, in the last ditch defense of the Republic against the New World Order.
[00:33:52.515 --> 00:34:00.405]  We may not save this country, we may be completely overrun and live in third world slavery, but at least we're gonna give them a fight 110%!
[00:34:00.646 --> 00:34:02.228]  I'm sick of the New World Order!
[00:34:12.837 --> 00:34:18.579]  Dr. Jerome Corsi coming up here in just a minute or two with horrible news, but at least we have this news.
[00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:25.681]  Huge full court press to bring in their total amnesty in the final decapitation of the United States.
[00:34:26.081 --> 00:34:29.902]  But first, in-game pre-orders are now available.
[00:34:30.262 --> 00:34:35.284]  You will be the first to have it shipped to you November 1st at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:35.624 --> 00:34:36.764]  What is in-game cover?
[00:34:36.944 --> 00:34:37.605]  Here it is.
[00:34:38.645 --> 00:34:40.065]  It is a big idea.
[00:34:40.085 --> 00:34:42.186]  A new world order.
[00:34:46.562 --> 00:34:52.725]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:34:52.805 --> 00:34:54.586]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:34:54.906 --> 00:34:59.188]  Don't their objective mean world domination?
[00:35:00.068 --> 00:35:02.549]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:10.913]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:35:16.787 --> 00:35:23.450]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:28.673]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:31.814]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:35:32.074 --> 00:35:35.876]  If only an educated, informed public could stop them in their tracks.
[00:35:38.875 --> 00:35:41.977]  For the first time, all the pieces have been put together.
[00:35:42.597 --> 00:35:46.039]  The dots have been connected, and the picture is crystal clear.
[00:35:47.099 --> 00:35:50.621]  Earth's ruling elite believe they have discovered the fountain.
[00:35:51.441 --> 00:35:55.643]  But before they can attain it, 80% of us must die.
[00:35:55.663 --> 00:36:03.207]  A psychopathic technocracy is establishing world government so there can be no escape from their plan.
[00:36:08.613 --> 00:36:10.855]  The New World Order is the Old World Order.
[00:36:10.915 --> 00:36:13.617]  I mean, it's just the names have changed, the appearances have changed.
[00:36:13.878 --> 00:36:15.019]  Most people have no idea.
[00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:15.819]  They're not after money.
[00:36:15.839 --> 00:36:16.940]  They have all the money they need.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:17.901]  They're after power.
[00:36:18.882 --> 00:36:19.803]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:36:20.463 --> 00:36:25.147]  A pull-up of a plane and you and it could be interrogated in four hours.
[00:36:25.227 --> 00:36:26.208]  Some shots were fired.
[00:36:26.228 --> 00:36:28.450]  We need you to move off the property.
[00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:32.213]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:36:37.054 --> 00:36:37.454]  Endgame.
[00:36:37.835 --> 00:36:39.576]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:36:39.876 --> 00:36:41.417]  You have been warned.
[00:36:43.478 --> 00:36:57.227]  And folks, when you're on InfoWars.com, pre-ordering Endgame, be sure and get the Late Great USA, New York Times bestseller by Dr. Jerome Corsi, where he lays out with their own documents the North American Union plan now unfolding.
[00:36:57.587 --> 00:37:05.392]  Just as they said in Austin, a microcosm, no new toll roads, then they surprise announce they're doing it last night, front page of the paper.
[00:37:06.022 --> 00:37:09.945]  Again, it's a military tactic of denying they're going to attack right until they attack.
[00:37:10.465 --> 00:37:12.067]  This is an economic takeover.
[00:37:12.447 --> 00:37:14.829]  This is a complete looting of the United States.
[00:37:15.649 --> 00:37:18.952]  And I hope you'll pre-order Endgame at Infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:37:18.972 --> 00:37:19.112]  It's $19.95.
[00:37:19.152 --> 00:37:23.175]  You can also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:37:33.143 --> 00:37:38.747]  We also have the Late Great U.S.A., I guess now in its third or fourth printing, I'm not sure, in stock.
[00:37:39.868 --> 00:37:42.130]  And a couple hundred of those, we're already ordering some more.
[00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:50.116]  And if you're writing to us in a letter, but $19.95 on top of that, and you also can get the Late Great U.S.A.
[00:37:50.396 --> 00:37:58.342]  Dr. Corsi, thanks for holding while I ranted and raved about my new film that dovetails with your book when it comes to the North American Union section.
[00:37:58.562 --> 00:37:59.663]  I want to thank you for coming on.
[00:37:59.963 --> 00:38:01.404]  Well, Alex, it's an honor to be with you.
[00:38:01.424 --> 00:38:02.545]  I can't wait to see your new film.
[00:38:03.104 --> 00:38:08.346]  Well, we just got them in, and we're going to be shipping them out here in a few weeks, but I can send you an early copy.
[00:38:08.927 --> 00:38:10.147]  Yeah, I'd sure like to see it.
[00:38:10.367 --> 00:38:11.528]  I think it ought to be terrific.
[00:38:12.348 --> 00:38:17.770]  A lot's going on, and obviously I want to talk about your new article for World Net Daily, Bush Backs Mexico Rapist Murderer.
[00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:26.094]  But before we do that, I mean, obviously you're noticing the new full-court press with a bill introduced for another amnesty.
[00:38:27.123 --> 00:38:35.069]  And it's boo-hoo, the food prices have gone up because the illegal aliens have been arrested.
[00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:39.573]  The truth is they've only arrested 30-something thousand this year out of three plus million every year that are here.
[00:38:40.354 --> 00:38:41.474]  It's a total smoke and mirrors.
[00:38:41.494 --> 00:38:42.535]  I want to get your take on that.
[00:38:42.916 --> 00:38:45.377]  And the food prices are up because the dollar's tanking.
[00:38:45.658 --> 00:38:47.799]  And you've got a doctorate in political science.
[00:38:47.819 --> 00:38:50.321]  Can you explain this to people that it's a fraud?
[00:38:50.902 --> 00:38:54.965]  I've been arguing this is an engineered collapse of the dollar now for two years, Alex.
[00:38:55.692 --> 00:39:02.637]  The pre-credit, I mean this open printing money that the Federal Reserve has done, had to come to an end.
[00:39:02.657 --> 00:39:03.617]  They're still doing it.
[00:39:04.098 --> 00:39:11.202]  But as they raise rates, which they'll have to do, because otherwise the dollar is just going to continue to sink and it could collapse.
[00:39:11.903 --> 00:39:19.288]  Because Europe is now raising rates, Europe has rates much higher than we do, and we've got this huge imbalance of trade to China.
[00:39:19.864 --> 00:39:24.005]  China's got $1.3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, 80% of it in dollars.
[00:39:24.485 --> 00:39:26.966]  It looks like that's a growing deficit to China.
[00:39:27.786 --> 00:39:34.808]  Our economic situation couldn't be weaker at the moment internationally, and people shouldn't be fooled by the stock market hitting new highs.
[00:39:35.268 --> 00:39:36.669]  That's just a credit party.
[00:39:37.209 --> 00:39:41.390]  If the rates went up, if the Federal Reserve quits printing money,
[00:39:42.106 --> 00:39:47.288]  You'd see Wall Street collapse a thousand points like it did just a few weeks ago, a few months ago.
[00:39:47.308 --> 00:40:02.673]  Now to break that down, because I talked to well-to-do, upper-middle class people, some of them making millions a year, and they can't understand that a devalued dollar that is then transferred into a stock market means that stock market's really at $8,000.
[00:40:03.274 --> 00:40:03.774]  That's right.
[00:40:04.314 --> 00:40:05.354]  And that's the problem.
[00:40:05.394 --> 00:40:07.255]  See, Alex, this whole thing is a house of cards.
[00:40:07.907 --> 00:40:12.449]  The dollar today is at $1.41 for a euro.
[00:40:13.049 --> 00:40:16.490]  When Bush came into office, it was at 87 cents for a euro.
[00:40:17.011 --> 00:40:20.992]  That's how much devaluation we've had while George Bush has been president.
[00:40:21.052 --> 00:40:24.033]  That's been engineered by printing money.
[00:40:24.574 --> 00:40:31.716]  We've got tremendous inflation, but the inflation statistics are a lie because the Federal Reserve, actually the U.S.
[00:40:31.756 --> 00:40:32.957]  Bureau of Labor Statistics,
[00:40:33.638 --> 00:40:34.239]  Thanks for
[00:40:53.655 --> 00:40:55.256]  And by the way, they do it for another reason, Alex.
[00:40:55.336 --> 00:40:56.377]  Most people don't know.
[00:40:56.817 --> 00:41:05.945]  As long as they keep the inflation numbers low, they keep the Social Security payments low, because the Social Security payments are indexed to the cost of living.
[00:41:06.525 --> 00:41:18.434]  The Social Security payments, if inflation were honestly reported, the Consumer Price Index, the way it used to be reported 20 years ago, you'd have Social Security checks that would be 40 to 50 percent higher than they are today.
[00:41:19.735 --> 00:41:20.736]  They're stealing money
[00:41:21.275 --> 00:41:27.299]  Already from the retirees by lying about the rate of inflation that we truly have.
[00:41:27.339 --> 00:41:36.604]  They're manipulating the numbers so that they don't have to follow the mandatory increases in social security payments that the cost of living adjustments would require.
[00:41:36.844 --> 00:41:43.008]  Dr. Corsi, a new urban legend is now being entered into the nomenclature and that is that
[00:41:43.695 --> 00:41:50.405]  The food prices are up 25 plus percent in the last month because the precious illegal aliens have been deported.
[00:41:50.765 --> 00:41:57.035]  They don't mention that most of the food's already grown outside the country or that big agribusiness is doing it or that most of those farm workers
[00:41:57.893 --> 00:41:58.613]  We're good to go.
[00:42:19.759 --> 00:42:24.243]  Deporting a few thousand illegals caused this, when it's the banks behind it!
[00:42:24.523 --> 00:42:29.707]  It's always been a lie that the illegals are needed in order to keep food prices down.
[00:42:30.948 --> 00:42:36.673]  If you remember the Bracero program during the Eisenhower administration, they told the same lie.
[00:42:36.713 --> 00:42:42.037]  They said if we didn't have these migrant workers up from Mexico, food prices would skyrocket.
[00:42:42.598 --> 00:42:49.263]  Well, even Cesar Chavez, who organized the Hispanic farm workers, opposed the illegal immigrants.
[00:42:49.986 --> 00:42:54.047]  Because the real agenda is just to lower the cost of labor to near nothing.
[00:42:55.188 --> 00:43:02.571]  When the Pecaro Program was ended, the agricultural cost in California only went up marginally in the price of food.
[00:43:02.591 --> 00:43:03.671]  It was hardly noticeable.
[00:43:04.426 --> 00:43:08.429]  What most of the agribusinesses did was that they introduced technology.
[00:43:08.629 --> 00:43:10.490]  They automated it.
[00:43:11.471 --> 00:43:23.579]  Exactly, most costs, because I've actually looked at the studies, most of the cost of agriculture is the fertilizers, the equipment, the processing, the delivery, the markup.
[00:43:23.599 --> 00:43:28.623]  Taking the food out of the farm is not the major cost of the agricultural process.
[00:43:28.683 --> 00:43:31.765]  And when you pay the workers, what the workers, you know,
[00:43:32.333 --> 00:43:40.793]  Market wages, living wages, it does not so dramatically increase the overall cost of agriculture that it's going to make a huge difference in the supermarket.
[00:43:40.833 --> 00:43:41.254]  It doesn't.
[00:43:42.769 --> 00:43:46.931]  But when the agribusinesses have the ability to use slaves, they do.
[00:43:47.051 --> 00:43:49.393]  They cry when the slaves are taken away from them.
[00:43:49.933 --> 00:43:59.960]  And they use this as an excuse because the truth is, Alex, there's an insignificant number of illegal aliens that have been deported this year that have been rounded up.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.841]  The government admits to 12 million.
[00:44:01.881 --> 00:44:04.063]  There were studies again this week that came out.
[00:44:04.083 --> 00:44:07.405]  They were released at the National Press Club this week.
[00:44:07.425 --> 00:44:09.026]  They were reported on the World Net Daily.
[00:44:09.665 --> 00:44:12.628]  Saying there's at least 20 million, maybe 38 million.
[00:44:12.668 --> 00:44:15.531]  The number that they reported was 38 million illegal aliens.
[00:44:15.631 --> 00:44:17.353]  Oh, I guarantee you it's 38 million.
[00:44:17.413 --> 00:44:18.173]  It is, it is.
[00:44:18.814 --> 00:44:25.781]  There are so many illegal aliens in Austin that literally they've got to be double the entire rest of the population.
[00:44:26.366 --> 00:44:31.729]  I think, Alex, this case of Medellin, this Jose Medellin, is making people's blood boil.
[00:44:31.749 --> 00:44:32.670]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:33.470]  Let's talk about that.
[00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:37.192]  This is a guy, Jose Medellin, is on Capitol Row.
[00:44:37.212 --> 00:44:40.974]  He's on death row in Texas prison, Livingston, I guess it is.
[00:44:41.975 --> 00:44:45.777]  He and his buddies, there was a gang rape.
[00:44:45.797 --> 00:44:50.219]  There were two teenage girls who were coming home late.
[00:44:50.239 --> 00:44:51.360]  They'd been at a swimming party.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.340]  They wanted to get home quick.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:53.401]  They took a shortcut.
[00:44:54.412 --> 00:44:58.575]  And these guys have been, they've just gone through a gang initiation, they're all Mexican illegals.
[00:44:59.336 --> 00:45:11.145]  They were drinking beer, they saw the girls, they accosted them, they raped them, sodomized them for an hour, brutally beat them, strangled them, and abandoned them in this field.
[00:45:11.826 --> 00:45:16.710]  Now, Medellin, who was 18 when the crime was committed, it was committed in 1993, confessed to the crime.
[00:45:18.604 --> 00:45:45.060]  But now, he's decided that he has appealed, he got Mexico involved, and they've appealed to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, and President Bush is going to be, his lawyers, the White House lawyers are going to be arguing with Mexico, that because the Mexican Council was not called when Medellin was arrested, and he did not have legal advice from Mexico, he should be released.
[00:45:46.661 --> 00:45:48.262]  And this is outrageous,
[00:45:49.154 --> 00:45:51.315]  Well, this is a precedent-setting case.
[00:45:51.635 --> 00:45:55.857]  And the Bush administration is siding with the International Court.
[00:45:56.037 --> 00:46:11.383]  They're going to argue to our Supreme Court that we ought to, you know, forget our own laws, let Mexico have its way, and of course, you know, what's behind this is that Mexico and the Hague, the international law that we're going to be imposed on, does not like the death penalty.
[00:46:11.984 --> 00:46:14.625]  And so now we're going to have the Mexican nationals, 51 of them,
[00:46:15.698 --> 00:46:21.243]  In, on death row across the United States, they're all going to be saying, you know, we didn't get our rights.
[00:46:21.423 --> 00:46:27.228]  Well, Dr. Corsi, regardless of where people stand on the death penalty, we do not want to be under United Nations control.
[00:46:27.268 --> 00:46:31.151]  And people say, well, how are we under North American Union international edict?
[00:46:31.411 --> 00:46:35.274]  Every, every week foreign ports rule against us.
[00:46:35.294 --> 00:46:44.342]  I want you to comment on this, Dr. Alex, the idea of this case, you know, I'm a father, you know, this is a case that makes your blood boil to think that these two teenage girls,
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.842]  You know, raped, sodomized, beaten, killed in this field.
[00:46:49.522 --> 00:46:52.663]  And now Mexico says, but wait a minute, these are our Mexican nationals.
[00:46:52.703 --> 00:46:54.044]  You can't treat them nasty.
[00:46:54.384 --> 00:46:58.645]  But if these guys, if Medellin wants Mexican law, he should have stayed in Mexico.
[00:46:59.186 --> 00:47:01.046]  There's plenty of Mexican law in Mexico.
[00:47:01.547 --> 00:47:09.370]  And now President Bush is going to weigh in with Mexico and say, not only are we going to prosecute law enforcement agents when they shoot after,
[00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:12.692]  Pleading Mexican drug agents like Ramos and Campion.
[00:47:12.992 --> 00:47:14.653]  We're going to let Medellin out of jail.
[00:47:14.713 --> 00:47:28.863]  We're going to say, you know, our laws don't apply to the... The Bush administration is going to weigh in on the side of a rapist and murderer, an illegal from Mexico, who brutally murdered, raped, and sodomized two young teenage girls.
[00:47:29.603 --> 00:47:30.484]  This is travesty!
[00:47:30.544 --> 00:47:32.585]  Have they executed any of the people that did this?
[00:47:33.346 --> 00:47:35.267]  No, there were four involved.
[00:47:35.287 --> 00:47:36.208]  There were a total of four.
[00:47:36.849 --> 00:47:39.892]  And he evidently was the only one who was over 18 at the time.
[00:47:40.372 --> 00:47:43.895]  His brother, who was 14 at the time, was sentenced to 40 years in prison.
[00:47:44.375 --> 00:47:48.999]  And the two of the other gang members, they'd just gone through a gang ritual of initiation.
[00:47:49.479 --> 00:47:53.743]  They were out here, it was out by railroad tracks in Houston, in this area of Houston.
[00:47:54.103 --> 00:47:55.464]  The girls were taking a shortcut.
[00:47:55.524 --> 00:47:59.447]  They were late for the swimming party, and they didn't want to upset their parents.
[00:47:59.487 --> 00:48:01.609]  They wanted to get home quick, so they took the shortcut.
[00:48:02.344 --> 00:48:21.854]  And these guys were out there drinking beer after their Mexican gang initiation party, and they see these two teenage girls coming along the railroad tracks, and they go grab them, knock them down, pull them by the hair, uh, down into this ravine, and rape them for an hour, beat them brutally, sodomize them, and strangle them to death.
[00:48:22.335 --> 00:48:26.577]  And then, one of them, Madeline, I believe even, he took one of the girls out of Mickey Mouse Watch.
[00:48:26.617 --> 00:48:28.398]  He took her Mickey Mouse Watch as a souvenir.
[00:48:30.469 --> 00:48:33.552]  Just to finish the point I started making earlier, Doctor, and I want your comment on this.
[00:48:33.653 --> 00:48:33.873]  Right.
[00:48:34.273 --> 00:48:37.877]  Just a month ago, an international tribunal ordered Mexican trucks to come in.
[00:48:37.897 --> 00:48:38.417]  That's correct.
[00:48:38.457 --> 00:48:40.840]  That's an example of how we're under international control.
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:51.270]  But the Mexican trucks people, even John Cornyn, the Republican senator from Texas, in the Senate floor when they were debating,
[00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:53.451]  The Dorgan Amendment.
[00:48:53.791 --> 00:49:01.896]  Senator Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, introduced an amendment to take away the funding for the Mexican trucking experiment with the Department of Transportation.
[00:49:02.376 --> 00:49:04.177]  Cornyn said, well, NAFTA's a treaty.
[00:49:04.277 --> 00:49:04.998]  We have to do this.
[00:49:05.438 --> 00:49:06.579]  NAFTA's not a treaty.
[00:49:06.639 --> 00:49:07.259]  It's a law.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:17.305]  And, yes, the Mexican truck provision is in NAFTA, but Bill Clinton refused to enforce that provision because he said the Mexican trucks were unsafe.
[00:49:17.645 --> 00:49:19.026]  It was a NAFTA tribunal.
[00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:27.356]  And that's my point, is that every week I see these foreign tribunals making rulings and then you talk to Neocon
[00:49:36.722 --> 00:49:42.584]  Followers of Bush, and they're saying, oh, we're not under international control, and the mainline liberals say that.
[00:49:42.964 --> 00:49:48.946]  I mean, almost everything is under these treaties and agreements and baloney.
[00:49:49.527 --> 00:50:04.132]  I think this Medellin case is going to be the tipping point, because I think when people see the Bush administration weighing in on behalf of a Mexican illegal alien who sodomized, raped, and killed these girls, and the brutal way in which it was done,
[00:50:04.791 --> 00:50:06.929]  I don't care if they call the Mexican Embassy or not.
[00:50:07.532 --> 00:50:15.754]  And this case already once has gone to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court basically decided that they did not have a right to call the Mexican Embassy under our law.
[00:50:16.394 --> 00:50:23.696]  Now, they appealed it a second time, and the second appeal that Medellin has launched, you know, he's crying in there in the federal prison.
[00:50:23.776 --> 00:50:24.856]  He's worrying about himself.
[00:50:24.896 --> 00:50:26.577]  He didn't worry very much about the two girls he's got.
[00:50:26.597 --> 00:50:29.557]  And now the White House is trying to aid him to the United Nations.
[00:50:29.697 --> 00:50:35.899]  They're going to the United Nations, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, to overturn our own law.
[00:50:35.919 --> 00:50:36.899]  Well, I just want to say this.
[00:50:37.714 --> 00:50:45.358]  In Mexico, when they grab you and extort every dime out of you, and keep you for a year in one of their cesspits, you don't hear our media whining about it.
[00:50:47.378 --> 00:50:49.219]  And so, it's a narco-terrorist state.
[00:50:49.239 --> 00:50:50.660]  It's why our government loves them.
[00:50:52.081 --> 00:50:53.121]  Dr. Corsi, stay with us.
[00:50:53.141 --> 00:50:57.143]  Let's come back and talk about what you think should be done about this, right here on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:51:04.557 --> 00:51:07.740]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.022]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.382 --> 00:51:18.048]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.729 --> 00:51:25.774]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.174 --> 00:51:33.080]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[00:51:33.556 --> 00:51:37.557]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.897 --> 00:51:41.458]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.858 --> 00:51:44.059]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.119 --> 00:51:48.060]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.149 --> 00:52:04.170]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:04.491 --> 00:52:09.413]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.673 --> 00:52:14.015]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.315 --> 00:52:23.239]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.439 --> 00:52:27.041]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.341 --> 00:52:32.363]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.663 --> 00:52:39.406]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:39.887 --> 00:52:40.427]  What about you?
[00:52:41.175 --> 00:52:46.538]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:53:01.056 --> 00:53:04.497]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:53:04.737 --> 00:53:06.837]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:53:06.997 --> 00:53:09.458]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:53:09.718 --> 00:53:14.058]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[00:53:14.098 --> 00:53:14.779]  Here's why.
[00:53:15.199 --> 00:53:21.120]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:27.361]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[00:53:27.601 --> 00:53:28.521]  But they're not cheating.
[00:53:28.761 --> 00:53:29.542]  We're good to go.
[00:53:58.761 --> 00:54:06.384]  I monitor Spanish radio and television.
[00:54:07.444 --> 00:54:12.006]  The hatred of this country is just off the chart.
[00:54:12.146 --> 00:54:12.406]  It's public.
[00:54:26.368 --> 00:54:33.911]  And then I found out a few years ago that Mexico worked with the Germans twice and carried out huge mass murders, 20 plus people a day in some cases.
[00:54:34.751 --> 00:54:36.392]  Military attacks on the U.S.
[00:54:36.592 --> 00:54:40.013]  This is in the last century.
[00:54:40.033 --> 00:54:41.934]  1918, they tried in the 40s.
[00:54:43.895 --> 00:54:45.355]  And I'm not supposed to talk about that.
[00:54:46.516 --> 00:54:55.039]  And I'm not supposed to talk about how the illegal aliens on average take double what they actually contribute out in welfare.
[00:54:56.491 --> 00:55:01.614]  And then the media is engaged in all this propaganda about the dear, sweet, precious, little illegal aliens.
[00:55:02.854 --> 00:55:08.537]  Frankly, it would drive down wages and hurt everybody if they were here, but if they didn't hate me so much and hate America so much...
[00:55:09.247 --> 00:55:12.510]  A large percentage does, and I wouldn't find it as upsetting.
[00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:31.626]  I mean, Dr. Corsi, this is about the worst scenario geopolitically in history I could think of with a government bringing in a very nationalistic group that's lost two wars to the nation, who openly want its destruction, and then the government tries to tell everybody that's not the case and keep that secret.
[00:55:32.066 --> 00:55:36.750]  Well, you're right, Alex, and I think this case, this Medellin case, this rapist-murderer,
[00:55:37.546 --> 00:55:40.790]  You know, two teenage girls raped and murdered in 1993.
[00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:47.317]  Bush saying now to the Supreme Court that we've got to roll over and let international law apply.
[00:55:47.337 --> 00:55:55.186]  The next thing that's going to happen, I mean, if Mexico can demand that its consular offices, 47 consular offices,
[00:55:56.468 --> 00:56:01.571]  We're here to protect the civil rights of Mexican nationals under Mexican law, or international law.
[00:56:02.072 --> 00:56:05.594]  And we've got one-tenth of Mexico's population living in the United States today.
[00:56:06.154 --> 00:56:10.137]  By 2010, it's going to be one out of every five people born in Mexico.
[00:56:10.157 --> 00:56:16.021]  You're adopting Mexican law, we're adopting international law, the corridors are going to be under international agreements.
[00:56:16.081 --> 00:56:16.501]  That's right.
[00:56:16.541 --> 00:56:18.102]  And have their own police forces.
[00:56:18.422 --> 00:56:19.963]  This is how they're carving the country up.
[00:56:20.003 --> 00:56:20.984]  It's happening right now.
[00:56:21.424 --> 00:56:24.286]  And, you know, look, the story I wrote in the North Carolina driver's license.
[00:56:24.733 --> 00:56:25.033]  I don't
[00:56:44.165 --> 00:56:47.087]  Uh, driver's license issued in North America.
[00:56:47.647 --> 00:56:49.308]  I said to her, don't you mean North Carolina?
[00:56:49.328 --> 00:56:50.728]  She said, no, North America.
[00:56:51.209 --> 00:56:56.632]  Because the hologram was created by, you know, the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators.
[00:56:56.652 --> 00:57:00.213]  Yeah, it's all happening, and the heads of that go to these secret SPP meetings.
[00:57:00.514 --> 00:57:05.176]  It's all happening in front of us, and they just deny it even exists.
[00:57:05.256 --> 00:57:08.618]  Well, we're going to break a story in the next hour of World Net Daily.
[00:57:08.658 --> 00:57:10.158]  I just wrote it up a few minutes ago.
[00:57:10.999 --> 00:57:12.860]  Last night on Larry King Live,
[00:57:13.579 --> 00:57:14.079]  I think so.
[00:57:33.945 --> 00:57:44.316]  Long term, he and Bush had the plan to create the Free Trade Act of the Americas, to take a trade union all the way down to the tip of South America.
[00:57:44.917 --> 00:57:47.320]  It was only stopped, he said, by Hugo Chavez.
[00:57:47.995 --> 00:57:50.718]  Larry King says, you mean we're going to have a euro dollar?
[00:57:51.218 --> 00:57:52.839]  And Fox says, long term.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.881]  This is mega huge!
[00:57:54.921 --> 00:57:57.604]  You're saying this was on Larry King last night?
[00:57:57.684 --> 00:57:58.825]  I've got the transcript.
[00:57:58.865 --> 00:58:00.907]  I'm publishing it as the headline right now.
[00:58:00.987 --> 00:58:06.191]  And then what will happen, Doc, is that as we try to even show people that clip, they'll say it's not real.
[00:58:06.231 --> 00:58:06.652]  Right.
[00:58:07.112 --> 00:58:08.473]  He says it'll be long term.
[00:58:08.513 --> 00:58:13.178]  The way these processes go, the first step is to make it into a trade agreement.
[00:58:13.818 --> 00:58:16.621]  And then a new vision, like we are doing with NAFTA.
[00:58:17.021 --> 00:58:20.664]  So there it is, and Penny Fox admits we are headed towards a regional currency, the Amaro.
[00:58:22.566 --> 00:58:23.567]  Unbelievable.
[00:58:23.987 --> 00:58:25.248]  Can you stay with us a few more minutes?
[00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:26.229]  I'd be happy to.
[00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:27.490]  I know you're very busy, Doc.
[00:58:27.551 --> 00:58:28.231]  Okay, stay there.
[00:58:28.251 --> 00:58:30.433]  We'll continue to discuss this on the other side.
[00:58:30.473 --> 00:58:32.275]  I mean, it's revelation after revelation.
[00:58:32.595 --> 00:58:36.719]  And you go tell these yuppies this stuff, and they have no idea it even exists.
[00:58:36.739 --> 00:58:39.081]  They've been pre-programmed to just snicker and giggle.
[00:58:41.457 --> 00:58:46.298]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.338 --> 00:58:46.778]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.938 --> 00:58:47.718]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.938 --> 00:58:50.179]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:50.259 --> 00:58:52.339]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.301 --> 00:59:05.161]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.181 --> 00:59:09.523]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.043 --> 00:59:14.165]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.325 --> 00:59:19.306]  Harvard PhD in Political Science, Dr. Jerome Coursey joins us.
[00:59:20.507 --> 00:59:22.728]  Fighting the New World Order on the front lines.
[00:59:23.188 --> 00:59:26.429]  He just dropped a huge, stunning bombshell on me.
[00:59:27.269 --> 00:59:31.711]  It's one thing to have SPP, North American Union, TxDOT, Department of Transportation,
[00:59:32.882 --> 00:59:38.464]  Secretary of State documents, CFR documents, where they say they're going to merge the three countries and they're already deep into it.
[00:59:39.185 --> 00:59:47.608]  It's another thing to have that criminal, Vicente Fox, that America-hating piece of filth, running around in the U.S.
[00:59:47.708 --> 00:59:50.289]  calling us racist if we want to control our borders.
[00:59:53.091 --> 00:59:54.151]  He just gave you the quote.
[00:59:54.191 --> 00:59:55.852]  It's going up on World Net Daily in the next hour.
[00:59:56.892 --> 00:59:58.673]  We're searching YouTube right now.
[01:00:00.235 --> 01:00:02.036]  Go slowly through this, Dr. Corsi.
[01:00:02.116 --> 01:00:03.397]  Read the quote for people.
[01:00:04.458 --> 01:00:07.840]  Have you found it on YouTube, or do you have a video clip of it?
[01:00:07.861 --> 01:00:09.902]  Because people aren't even going to believe it when it's in quotes.
[01:00:10.122 --> 01:00:13.905]  They don't believe it when MSNBC announces they won an Emeril, but go through that.
[01:00:14.205 --> 01:00:19.169]  Now, CNN is saying that a video clip is available, but you have to buy it from them.
[01:00:19.209 --> 01:00:20.570]  They've got the transcript up.
[01:00:21.171 --> 01:00:22.892]  Let me tell you what the transcript says.
[01:00:23.853 --> 01:00:26.715]  This was a caller who called, and it was right at the end of the show.
[01:00:26.735 --> 01:00:27.516]  It was an email.
[01:00:28.217 --> 01:00:38.005]  And it was this Mrs. Gonzales in New Jersey, and she said, Mr. Fox, I'd like to know how you feel about the possibility of having a Latin America united with one currency.
[01:00:38.785 --> 01:00:41.287]  And Fox said, long term, very long term.
[01:00:41.768 --> 01:00:49.854]  Well, we proposed together, President Bush and myself, it's ALCA, which that's the Free Trade Agreement of the Americans.
[01:00:49.894 --> 01:00:53.617]  That's the Spanish acronym, ALCA, for the Free Trade Agreement of the Americans.
[01:00:54.164 --> 01:00:56.746]  He said it's a trade union for all the Americas.
[01:00:57.046 --> 01:01:00.788]  The common market extending NAFTA down to the tip of South America.
[01:01:00.808 --> 01:01:05.491]  And everything was running fluently until Hugo Chavez came in.
[01:01:06.051 --> 01:01:10.314]  He decided to isolate himself and he decided to combat the idea and destroy the idea.
[01:01:10.774 --> 01:01:14.476]  So King says, it's going to be like the Euro-dollar you mean?
[01:01:15.096 --> 01:01:17.838]  And Fox says, well that would be long, long term.
[01:01:18.458 --> 01:01:22.741]  I think the processes go, the first step is into a trade agreement.
[01:01:23.314 --> 01:01:27.676]  And then further on, a new vision like we are trying to do with NAFTA.
[01:01:28.356 --> 01:01:28.936]  So there it is.
[01:01:29.016 --> 01:01:36.159]  The whole idea was to extend this trade idea, to have it followed by a regional currency.
[01:01:36.179 --> 01:01:37.199]  But you just hit the key.
[01:01:37.299 --> 01:01:41.361]  That was a larger Pan-American Union from Alaska to Chile.
[01:01:41.401 --> 01:01:42.001]  Exactly.
[01:01:42.121 --> 01:01:48.164]  He's saying, like we're doing with NAFTA, showing we are currently in the integration.
[01:01:48.244 --> 01:01:48.924]  On the plan.
[01:01:50.256 --> 01:02:12.101]  And the key is, he says, that we proposed together, President Bush and myself, he said, this was our plan, and it was to NAFTA going into a regional currency, then extend the trade agreement with the free trade agreements of the America all through South America, and then have it followed with a hemisphere regional currency.
[01:02:12.201 --> 01:02:15.602]  But Doc, I gotta, again, make this point for listeners who may have missed it.
[01:02:16.255 --> 01:02:16.996]  This is key.
[01:02:17.596 --> 01:02:31.190]  Fox goes on to say, like we've done with NAFTA, he's saying merge everything together later in the hemisphere, like we're doing with NAFTA, a total admission of current merger of North America.
[01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:32.691]  Correct.
[01:02:32.811 --> 01:02:33.692]  Unabashedly.
[01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:34.993]  He's just open about it.
[01:02:35.033 --> 01:02:38.136]  He says the only thing that stopped it from happening was Hugo Chavez.
[01:02:38.954 --> 01:02:51.857]  And if you recall, Hugo Chavez, at the meeting where they were trying to push down in Argentina, this was in the first administration, they were trying to push the free trade agreement of the Americas, and Chavez came and acted up and broke up the meeting.
[01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:53.438]  I want to ask you about that when we come back.
[01:02:53.458 --> 01:02:54.298]  Can you stay ten more minutes?
[01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:54.658]  Yes.
[01:02:54.818 --> 01:02:58.699]  I know you're busy, but this is key because I have a love-hate relationship with Chavez.
[01:02:58.819 --> 01:03:00.680]  I don't like socialism or communism.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.680]  I don't like him restricting the media.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.741]  It's going to be ironic if he's the guy who ends up protecting our sovereignty.
[01:03:06.528 --> 01:03:13.151]  But I mean, that's my point, is that it's a love-hate, because... He doesn't want globalism.
[01:03:13.171 --> 01:03:14.511]  He's against globalism.
[01:03:14.571 --> 01:03:16.092]  Chavez hates the globalism.
[01:03:16.812 --> 01:03:25.955]  The problem is he also hates the United States, but it's an amazing admission here that this plan was going fluently, he says, fluently.
[01:03:26.476 --> 01:03:33.838]  They had the plan fully in gear, and it included a currency, the euro-dollar, like Larry King said, the euro-dollar.
[01:03:37.223 --> 01:03:38.244]  Unbelievable!
[01:03:38.304 --> 01:03:40.026]  Dr. Coursey is our guest.
[01:03:40.126 --> 01:03:41.888]  I'm glad I got him on today about this other issue.
[01:03:41.908 --> 01:03:44.010]  He just keeps dropping bombshell after bombshell.
[01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:45.371]  An exclusive here!
[01:03:45.451 --> 01:03:48.034]  Doc, I appreciate you sharing that with us here first.
[01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:48.895]  That is amazing!
[01:03:49.255 --> 01:03:51.217]  Come back, we'll get some more details from you.
[01:03:53.925 --> 01:03:59.027]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:03:59.087 --> 01:04:06.409]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:17.172]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:04:17.373 --> 01:04:21.914]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:04:21.954 --> 01:04:22.314]  I think?
[01:04:40.445 --> 01:04:45.426]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:04:45.646 --> 01:04:48.946]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:04:49.026 --> 01:04:52.887]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:04:53.667 --> 01:04:57.228]  It's here!
[01:04:57.448 --> 01:05:02.229]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:02.589 --> 01:05:10.210]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.908 --> 01:05:17.974]  TerrorStorm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:18.375 --> 01:05:21.337]  TerrorStorm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:05:21.698 --> 01:05:24.020]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.261]  NSA Spy.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:29.741]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:30.101 --> 01:05:34.002]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:34.022 --> 01:05:36.002]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:36.322 --> 01:05:40.263]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:05:40.763 --> 01:05:48.224]  Get your copy today on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:54.041]  It's a fact.
[01:05:54.201 --> 01:06:01.746]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:06:01.846 --> 01:06:10.392]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, all debt has become mathematically impossible to repay, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:06:10.652 --> 01:06:21.280]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:27.644]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:06:27.864 --> 01:06:32.927]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:06:33.107 --> 01:06:37.630]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:39.611]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:06:39.671 --> 01:06:39.951]  That's 877-943-8600.
[01:06:39.971 --> 01:06:40.372]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[01:06:40.472 --> 01:06:42.373]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:06:49.617 --> 01:06:52.638]  My friends, this is not hyperbole.
[01:06:53.678 --> 01:06:55.778]  The West is going beneath the waves.
[01:06:55.858 --> 01:06:58.019]  That's the West, as Buchanan and others have said.
[01:07:16.977 --> 01:07:19.419]  We are in a last-ditch effort.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:30.325]  The globalists have publicly written hundreds of policy reports saying they were going to overrun Europe with third-world populations, and those third-world populations have no claim to Europe.
[01:07:31.166 --> 01:07:36.569]  The illegal aliens can claim, you know, that part of this was once Mexico for five minutes, but then they couldn't hold it.
[01:07:36.609 --> 01:07:37.910]  Yeah, the six flags of Texas.
[01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:39.391]  There were lots of people that had this land.
[01:07:41.718 --> 01:07:47.022]  Including the corrupt government of Spain, and the Emperor, Maximilian, and the rest of them.
[01:07:49.304 --> 01:07:57.490]  But I want all the illegal aliens listening, and I know there are a lot of them listening, in California, and right here in Texas, and other stations we've got around the country.
[01:07:58.291 --> 01:07:59.532]  You're hurting your children.
[01:08:00.032 --> 01:08:00.813]  There's no doubt.
[01:08:01.333 --> 01:08:02.754]  This New World Order is going to hurt you.
[01:08:03.515 --> 01:08:05.556]  Why do you think Hugo Chavez is against it?
[01:08:05.596 --> 01:08:10.460]  I mean, this is a communist Che Guevara type, and he knows that it's bad.
[01:08:11.502 --> 01:08:12.363]  Okay, he's against it.
[01:08:13.063 --> 01:08:16.305]  He is against globalization, NAFTA, GATT, disintegration.
[01:08:16.345 --> 01:08:17.426]  He calls it what it is.
[01:08:18.827 --> 01:08:20.708]  Mexico is not conquering the U.S.
[01:08:21.328 --> 01:08:27.312]  The globalists financed that propaganda for the last 30 plus years in your nation, so you'd come up here and think that.
[01:08:27.352 --> 01:08:34.256]  You're only being used to drive down wages, bankrupt the states so the feds can federalize them, and bring in total control.
[01:08:35.497 --> 01:08:39.760]  And Dr. Corsi is now reporting, and we did find the transcript, it's on CNN.com,
[01:08:41.393 --> 01:08:44.056]  So, for people that are in denial, you can show them CNN's official page.
[01:08:44.076 --> 01:08:46.598]  We need to get screenshots of that, by the way, before they take it down.
[01:08:46.618 --> 01:08:47.459]  I've seen them do it before.
[01:08:47.979 --> 01:08:52.663]  And somebody's got that T-vode, and needs to get that up on YouTube right now.
[01:08:53.304 --> 01:08:59.589]  Because, I've got Dick Cheney saying, yeah, I'm CFR, I'm secretly CFR, I didn't want the people to want to know that.
[01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:03.873]  Admitting a cover-up, and I got Neocon's email, and they're going, that's a fake video.
[01:09:03.933 --> 01:09:06.015]  I mean, they don't believe anything you show them.
[01:09:07.649 --> 01:09:10.871]  This is so, it's not hyperbole, it's life and death.
[01:09:11.632 --> 01:09:16.836]  If we go under this international system, we don't have private property rights, due process, any of this.
[01:09:16.936 --> 01:09:19.437]  It's happening now, May Day.
[01:09:19.958 --> 01:09:24.901]  Dr. Corsi, I mean, how do we stress the importance of the dire straits we're in?
[01:09:24.941 --> 01:09:31.946]  Hillary about to come in, all the evidence of the Bushes being behind her and handing her the baton, appointing all these Clinton officials.
[01:09:32.326 --> 01:09:35.969]  I mean, I don't know, Hillary Clinton, I don't know what we're going to do.
[01:09:36.713 --> 01:09:38.954]  I just keep reporting it piece by piece, Larry.
[01:09:40.774 --> 01:09:43.815]  Alex, if we keep it, like, put another brick in the wall.
[01:09:43.875 --> 01:09:44.875]  People have got to see it.
[01:09:44.895 --> 01:09:46.956]  The wall is going to get big enough they can't deny it.
[01:09:47.376 --> 01:09:52.978]  The Vincenni Fox interview on video is on CNN Video.
[01:09:53.058 --> 01:09:54.978]  Alex, I just sent you the link.
[01:09:55.038 --> 01:09:56.659]  I'm watching it right now as we're talking.
[01:09:57.219 --> 01:09:58.459]  Who's email did you send it to?
[01:09:58.939 --> 01:10:00.540]  I sent it to a producer, your show.
[01:10:02.353 --> 01:10:08.117]  Okay, I'll go send it, if you can, right now to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:09.598]  Hey, Aaron, get in here real fast.
[01:10:09.898 --> 01:10:10.799]  A-A-R-O-N?
[01:10:11.019 --> 01:10:12.140]  Yes, A-A-R-O-N.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:12.740]  He's coming in here.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.162]  Aaron, Dr. Corsi found it on CNN.
[01:10:16.402 --> 01:10:17.583]  This is War Room Radio.
[01:10:17.623 --> 01:10:18.744]  This is real radio, folks.
[01:10:18.784 --> 01:10:20.045]  We do things live on the fly.
[01:10:20.305 --> 01:10:21.726]  This is like you're inside the newsroom.
[01:10:21.966 --> 01:10:23.247]  Dr. Corsi says he found it.
[01:10:23.487 --> 01:10:25.368]  He's going to be sending it to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:26.629]  Right now, Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:27.330]  I just sent it.
[01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:28.210]  It's right there.
[01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:31.873]  They're showing... It's the Vincente Fox interview with Larry King.
[01:10:32.473 --> 01:10:34.134]  Yeah, they've got the whole interview there.
[01:10:34.534 --> 01:10:35.014]  We're on it!
[01:10:35.034 --> 01:10:35.394]  We've got it!
[01:10:35.414 --> 01:10:36.314]  We're grabbing it right now!
[01:10:36.594 --> 01:10:37.855]  Yep, and so you've got it now.
[01:10:37.895 --> 01:10:42.876]  You have to get it before it goes down, because they won't keep this one up very long.
[01:10:43.656 --> 01:10:48.138]  Clearly, and I sent you also the transcript, so you've got the exact transcript.
[01:10:48.518 --> 01:10:52.759]  While we were on break, the editor from WorldNetDaily called me.
[01:10:52.799 --> 01:10:55.500]  They're making the final changes now within the next half hour.
[01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:58.761]  It'll be the lead article on worldnetdaily.com.
[01:10:58.901 --> 01:11:00.241]  It was first broken on your show.
[01:11:01.061 --> 01:11:02.001]  Well, thank you, Dr. Corsi.
[01:11:02.021 --> 01:11:07.784]  We're going to get links up on PrisonPlanet.com immediately, and Paul's going to put a blurb up directly pointing at WorldNetDaily.
[01:11:07.824 --> 01:11:11.505]  It's just so good, though, to see the truth coming out.
[01:11:11.825 --> 01:11:16.387]  Why do you think that arrogant individual was so public?
[01:11:16.867 --> 01:11:24.931]  Well, I think, I've said for a long time, the best way to expose this is to give Vincenni Fox a microphone, because Vincenni Fox has been open about this back to 2000.
[01:11:26.232 --> 01:11:49.584]  You know, I quote in my book, it's on page 13 of the late, great USA, the Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial, which is also very hard to find, but Robert Bartley, who's the editor of the Wall Street Journal, July 21st, 2001, said that Vincenni Fox has been raising eyebrows with the suggestion that NAFTA, over a decade or two, should evolve into a European Union.
[01:11:50.244 --> 01:11:53.466]  Not only with open borders for goods and investment, but people as well.
[01:11:54.193 --> 01:12:00.940]  And so Vincenni Fox can rest assured that there's one voice north of the Rio Grande that supports his vision to whip this newspaper.
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:14.293]  So there you have the Wall Street Journal on record for North American Union with Vincenni Fox in 2001 openly proclaiming that that's what he wanted to do until they gave him some public relations counseling and told him not to say it so openly.
[01:12:14.934 --> 01:12:18.037]  And now you've got Vincenni Fox out there promoting his book
[01:12:18.698 --> 01:12:21.100]  And the penny fox speaks good English.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.822]  I mean, he's educated in the United States.
[01:12:22.842 --> 01:12:24.824]  He may have even been born in the United States.
[01:12:25.645 --> 01:12:40.719]  He is on Larry King and fluent English explaining that the plan he and Bush had was to do a trade union all the way, you know, this Free Trade Act of the Americas, a regional currency, and he said that's
[01:12:42.092 --> 01:12:44.693]  Larry King says it's going to be like the Eurodollar, you mean.
[01:12:44.753 --> 01:12:47.395]  And Fox says, well, that would be long, long term.
[01:12:47.535 --> 01:12:48.296]  Well, this is huge.
[01:12:48.336 --> 01:12:50.377]  Now, Dr. Corsi, let me just stop you for a moment.
[01:12:50.797 --> 01:12:52.238]  And we have found the video clip.
[01:12:52.299 --> 01:12:54.740]  We are getting it up on prisonpilot.com right now.
[01:12:55.741 --> 01:12:59.563]  Doc, what I'm trying to understand here is this tactic of lying.
[01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:01.625]  They're building the NAFTA arteries.
[01:13:01.885 --> 01:13:04.487]  The editors from WorldNetDaily just told me the video clip
[01:13:05.227 --> 01:13:14.432]  They cut out on that video clip the questions from the listeners, so they cut out at the end of it the part where they've already edited that and we're on CNN.
[01:13:14.552 --> 01:13:15.233]  I knew it!
[01:13:15.693 --> 01:13:22.237]  They said, they saw the clip, it doesn't include the questions from the listeners when he talks about the Americans.
[01:13:22.257 --> 01:13:23.557]  John's downloading it right now.
[01:13:23.637 --> 01:13:24.618]  John, is that the case?
[01:13:25.794 --> 01:13:34.156]  And the only part that goes right up to the questions with the listeners, and the transcript that's yet on CNN, includes the whole broadcast.
[01:13:34.196 --> 01:13:37.217]  So we've got to print that transcript out so we don't lose that.
[01:13:37.257 --> 01:13:38.998]  Yeah, we better get screenshots right now.
[01:13:39.218 --> 01:13:42.779]  And again, we just said they'd cut it out, because every time they do this, they cut it.
[01:13:42.799 --> 01:13:43.399]  You were right.
[01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:48.661]  When they posted the video, they cut out the questions from the listeners.
[01:13:48.681 --> 01:13:49.541]  Now, somebody out there
[01:13:50.094 --> 01:14:01.940]  May have taped the Vincenni Fox entire thing, the interview live last night from Larry King, and if somebody's got it, they've got a very valuable tape that they included the questions at the end of the interview from listeners.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:07.003]  Because it's now edited away from the CNN point.
[01:14:07.043 --> 01:14:14.507]  I think I'm going to email right now back to the editor, Art Moore, WorldNetDaily, and say, make that part of the story.
[01:14:16.201 --> 01:14:16.982]  Absolutely.
[01:14:17.062 --> 01:14:19.884]  Well, Dr. Corsi, this lying.
[01:14:20.304 --> 01:14:22.066]  We have all the official government documents.
[01:14:22.106 --> 01:14:23.287]  We have the admissions.
[01:14:23.707 --> 01:14:24.488]  They're doing it.
[01:14:24.548 --> 01:14:28.751]  We're going under international control in the courts, in our trade, in our military.
[01:14:29.694 --> 01:14:31.335]  And it's this tactic of lying.
[01:14:31.616 --> 01:14:35.839]  Like, they're building the NAFTA highway grid and connectors right outside Austin.
[01:14:36.179 --> 01:14:39.521]  They admit they're doing it, but when you complain, they then say it doesn't exist.
[01:14:39.962 --> 01:14:42.764]  This tactic of just bald-faced lying.
[01:14:43.504 --> 01:14:48.508]  When I was up in... I gave a speech two weeks ago up in Oklahoma, down in Oklahoma, in Tulsa.
[01:14:50.367 --> 01:15:00.796]  Randy Brogdon, the state senator, Republican, was there and he spoke, and he said they've already had to block legislation in Oklahoma to extend the Trans-Texas Corridor north into Oklahoma.
[01:15:00.856 --> 01:15:03.778]  The mayor signed on to an agreement for the North American Union!
[01:15:03.858 --> 01:15:05.860]  I wrote about that there.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:11.084]  Cornett, I believe his name, Nick Cornett, and I found the agreement published at World Bet Daily.
[01:15:11.104 --> 01:15:13.646]  I've been calling his office for a week for a comment.
[01:15:14.166 --> 01:15:14.907]  We published it.
[01:15:15.407 --> 01:15:17.469]  My phone was ringing at 7.30 in the morning.
[01:15:17.509 --> 01:15:19.671]  It was Nick Cornett, and he said, yeah, I signed the thing.
[01:15:20.251 --> 01:15:22.992]  I don't know what I was thinking two years ago or three years ago.
[01:15:23.012 --> 01:15:24.833]  I don't know what was going through my mind.
[01:15:25.253 --> 01:15:37.019]  But he was at a meeting of a group that's now part of NASCO, the North American Super Corridor Coalition, and they had this North American integration declaration, and he signed it.
[01:15:37.319 --> 01:15:38.339]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:15:38.359 --> 01:15:39.920]  I mean, this is the key I'm trying to get at.
[01:15:40.959 --> 01:15:46.860]  Have they miscalculated by stonewalling and lying, hoping the public wouldn't go look at their documents?
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:53.862]  Or, is this tactic of just lying and denying the elephant in the living room, do you think that's going to work?
[01:15:54.182 --> 01:15:57.063]  Well, I don't think it'll work because the truth always comes out.
[01:15:57.883 --> 01:16:01.404]  You know, even in Watergate, that was ridiculed and denied too.
[01:16:01.424 --> 01:16:06.825]  You know, you've had John Gibson take a shot at you, and I've had Michael Bedman and others take a shot at me.
[01:16:08.683 --> 01:16:12.705]  But the problem is people know that ridicule doesn't answer the question.
[01:16:13.325 --> 01:16:17.266]  People only ridicule when they can't... It's an ad hominem attack.
[01:16:17.286 --> 01:16:19.006]  It's the lowest form of argumentation.
[01:16:19.026 --> 01:16:24.188]  It means somebody doesn't have an argument or evidence to refute what you're saying.
[01:16:24.688 --> 01:16:25.728]  So they ridicule you.
[01:16:25.788 --> 01:16:26.789]  It doesn't answer anything.
[01:16:26.829 --> 01:16:27.829]  It just makes them look bad.
[01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:29.590]  Well, I have a Milt Strauman, too.
[01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:30.670]  I had folks...
[01:16:31.511 --> 01:16:40.775]  Take a picture of me at Ground Zero and say that I was there blaming the firemen for blowing the building up, which I've never said, but again, then I get this hate mail, how dare you say this?
[01:16:40.815 --> 01:16:42.556]  So they also build straw men.
[01:16:42.576 --> 01:16:43.736]  Do you ever have them do that to you?
[01:16:43.776 --> 01:16:44.997]  Claim you said things you didn't?
[01:16:45.277 --> 01:16:49.039]  To some extent they do, but you know, so much of my stuff, Alex, is in print.
[01:16:49.599 --> 01:16:54.941]  It's harder to do it with me because it's in print and the radio shows are generally all taped.
[01:16:55.482 --> 01:16:58.383]  So there's very good evidence of what I have said and I try to
[01:16:59.013 --> 01:17:05.095]  You know, to speak very carefully, because I'm always reporting only what I have the evidence to prove.
[01:17:05.175 --> 01:17:05.875]  No, but that's what I'm saying.
[01:17:05.895 --> 01:17:09.356]  They'll just take a picture of me and then just write a lie on it.
[01:17:09.376 --> 01:17:10.756]  They've done some of that with me.
[01:17:10.796 --> 01:17:18.358]  They've taken pictures for me and pasted Confederate flags in my lapel and put those up on the internet as if I was wearing the Confederate flag lapel.
[01:17:18.798 --> 01:17:25.420]  They've done things like that to me, but mostly I just ignore it all because it's so irritating, but it's
[01:17:26.304 --> 01:17:27.644]  It's an ad hominem attack.
[01:17:27.704 --> 01:17:29.125]  They can't, they're frustrated.
[01:17:29.525 --> 01:17:37.547]  What do you think the American people are going to do, last question, when they find out that they really are destroying the country, they really have destroyed the dollar?
[01:17:38.447 --> 01:17:41.588]  Well, I think that, you know, the American people are already angry.
[01:17:41.648 --> 01:17:49.029]  I'm saying, in a speech I gave on Book TV, I was with Phyllis Schlafly at Eagle Forum about three weeks ago in St.
[01:17:49.069 --> 01:17:51.570]  Louis, and at the end of the speech I said, you know,
[01:17:52.728 --> 01:18:00.472]  If somebody doesn't get Bush to stop talking about Mexico, the Republicans are going to lose the next presidential election and two-thirds of the House and Senate.
[01:18:00.812 --> 01:18:02.793]  And it isn't because people like Democrats.
[01:18:03.293 --> 01:18:17.960]  If Hillary Clinton gets in as a consequence and continues, which she will do, this globalism, because it's Bush-Clinton, Bush-Clinton, hand-in-hand, the same team, then Hillary Clinton will be inaugurated on January 20th and the impeachment proceedings will start
[01:18:18.587 --> 01:18:19.207]  January 21st.
[01:18:19.247 --> 01:18:23.028]  That's the only way we can handle this.
[01:18:23.728 --> 01:18:29.149]  I'm saying this Medellin case might bring the American public to want to impeach Bush right now.
[01:18:30.029 --> 01:18:30.609]  I agree.
[01:18:30.689 --> 01:18:32.590]  Dr. Corsi, thank you for the exclusive.
[01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:35.170]  Thank you for your tireless work to defend the Republic.
[01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:39.791]  His book is available right now, The Late Great USA at Infowars.com.
[01:18:39.831 --> 01:18:40.531]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:18:40.771 --> 01:18:41.472]  Always a pleasure.
[01:18:41.492 --> 01:18:42.492]  Great to be with you, Alex.
[01:18:42.532 --> 01:18:43.432]  Thanks for all the time.
[01:18:44.632 --> 01:18:46.113]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:18:46.153 --> 01:18:47.673]  We'll get into a bunch of other issues.
[01:18:47.733 --> 01:18:48.233]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.664 --> 01:18:56.666]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:18:56.987 --> 01:19:01.910]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:19:02.171 --> 01:19:06.514]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:19:06.814 --> 01:19:15.741]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:19:15.941 --> 01:19:19.544]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:19:19.844 --> 01:19:24.867]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:19:25.168 --> 01:19:31.912]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:19:32.392 --> 01:19:32.933]  What about you?
[01:19:33.687 --> 01:19:38.569]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.
[01:19:38.609 --> 01:19:39.029]  A $14 savings.
[01:19:39.089 --> 01:19:40.170]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:42.151]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:19:53.647 --> 01:19:57.548]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:19:57.769 --> 01:20:10.033]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:20:10.453 --> 01:20:10.873]  The U.S.
[01:20:10.913 --> 01:20:16.495]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:20:16.896 --> 01:20:19.096]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:20:20.977 --> 01:20:22.019]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:20:22.059 --> 01:20:24.902]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:20:25.022 --> 01:20:31.069]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:20:31.489 --> 01:20:34.833]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:41.261]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:20:41.801 --> 01:20:45.826]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:20:45.926 --> 01:20:46.126]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:46.146 --> 01:20:46.346]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.237 --> 01:20:55.719]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:55.799 --> 01:21:02.606]  Did you know that at the 29 Palms Marine Base located in California, a questionnaire was given to Marines stationed there?
[01:21:02.626 --> 01:21:06.689]  It discussed the United States military under UN command.
[01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:08.911]  Would the Marines accept this?
[01:21:09.011 --> 01:21:19.581]  The final statement to be answered, yes or no, was, I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.
[01:21:20.241 --> 01:21:21.662]  Is this what Americans want?
[01:21:21.802 --> 01:21:23.583]  Forced confiscation of guns?
[01:21:24.123 --> 01:21:31.706]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:32.446 --> 01:21:33.867]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:39.729 --> 01:21:42.450]  That's 1-800-516-8736.

[01:21:53.054 --> 01:22:01.077]  Hi, this is Jeff Rents, and if you're interested in suppressed natural cures and rare exotic remedies, this may be the most important message you'll hear for a long time.
[01:22:01.597 --> 01:22:10.886]  There's an opportunity right now for a limited number of listeners to acquire an amazing, blacklisted, naturally occurring compound with very unusual ionic properties.
[01:22:11.367 --> 01:22:15.671]  In fact, it's considered the single most important remedy in all of Ayurvedic medicine.
[01:22:16.272 --> 01:22:28.339]  Medical studies have been conducted abroad on the effects this rare mineral-like compound has on energy, diabetes, tumors, ulcers, memory, and brain function, not to mention reproductive health, exercise recovery, and arthritis.
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:33.783]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made.
[01:22:34.263 --> 01:22:37.645]  However, it's still quite legal to own this compound, and the best part?
[01:22:38.125 --> 01:22:39.586]  My listeners pay nothing down.
[01:22:39.666 --> 01:22:41.387]  Simply go to blacklistedherb.com.
[01:22:41.507 --> 01:22:44.009]  That's blacklistedherb.com.
[01:22:44.529 --> 01:22:44.989]  Or call 815-259-4552.
[01:22:45.010 --> 01:22:45.770]  That's 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:48.572]  This is the end Beautiful friend This is the end My only
[01:23:19.773 --> 01:23:20.654]  It's simple.
[01:23:46.152 --> 01:23:51.873]  There is an international brotherhood of financial interest.
[01:23:52.353 --> 01:23:54.614]  Their main power flowing from central banks.
[01:23:55.454 --> 01:23:58.794]  They were able to take over England, the United States, Europe, much of the world.
[01:23:59.675 --> 01:24:12.277]  They're now mopping up the few sovereign nations left and focusing their main attention on enslaving the individual, ripping the family limb from limb, destroying any industry and once strong sovereign nations.
[01:24:13.405 --> 01:24:27.218]  And their main target that they're hitting at every level is the United States, while using our strength and our sustenance and what was left of us to propel the construction of their New World Order global system.
[01:24:30.501 --> 01:24:35.305]  And they are just absolutely eviscerating this country right now.
[01:24:36.966 --> 01:24:39.669]  And I'm so angry at the public for not knowing their peril.
[01:24:41.917 --> 01:24:50.700]  People are going around about their business, or if you do convince them there's a North American Union and we're going into a one world government, they'll say, well that's the next step!
[01:24:52.381 --> 01:24:56.102]  To not have due process, to not have liberty, to not have private property?
[01:25:00.184 --> 01:25:01.264]  This is all for you!
[01:25:01.364 --> 01:25:03.725]  This is happening to be done to you!
[01:25:06.186 --> 01:25:07.687]  And it's all happening right now!
[01:25:10.785 --> 01:25:12.886]  And the New World Order means business.
[01:25:16.147 --> 01:25:22.549]  They mean business, and I'm really speechless right now.
[01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:25.550]  I mean, listen to this newscast.
[01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:30.011]  I want to play that clip, John, where they're talking about the farmers.
[01:25:31.231 --> 01:25:31.471]  Why?
[01:25:31.511 --> 01:25:35.032]  The food price is going up because the illegals have been deported.
[01:25:35.893 --> 01:25:36.953]  Here is that clip.
[01:25:37.665 --> 01:25:45.732]  Tighter security at the border is working so well the White House is now worried about the impact on agribusiness and ultimately the price you pay for produce.
[01:25:46.452 --> 01:25:54.719]  That head of napa cabbage on a produce aisle in Palo Alto was picked fresh by farm workers on Yasugi Farms about 50 miles away in Gilroy.
[01:25:55.199 --> 01:25:57.021]  It's hard work, few will do.
[01:25:57.659 --> 01:26:04.806]  Well, I've got guys out in the field as early as five o'clock in the morning and the last guys won't leave the field until six, seven o'clock at night.
[01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:07.149]  And there are fewer hands to harvest crops.
[01:26:07.709 --> 01:26:12.674]  Growers say tighter security at the border is closing off the supply of available workers.
[01:26:13.175 --> 01:26:18.520]  So why don't growers take advantage of a federal guest worker program known as the H-2A visa?
[01:26:19.195 --> 01:26:20.756]  It's extremely time-consuming.
[01:26:21.177 --> 01:26:25.680]  When you submit an application, oftentimes they can't turn it around for two or three months.
[01:26:26.161 --> 01:26:28.262]  And by then, half of our harvest season is gone.
[01:26:28.282 --> 01:26:38.290]  The Los Angeles Times reports the Departments of Homeland Security, State, and Labor are working behind the scenes to revamp H-2A farmworker visas.
[01:26:38.791 --> 01:26:44.956]  The White House spokesperson said it's important for the farm sector to have access to labor to stay competitive.
[01:26:45.703 --> 01:26:49.985]  I'm really happy to see the government starting to raise an eyebrow about the situation.
[01:26:50.865 --> 01:26:58.969]  Unfortunately, I think by the time they actually sit down, put their noses to the grindstone, and try to implement something, that could be years down the road before it's finally done.
[01:26:59.389 --> 01:27:07.513]  The owner of J&J Food Store, where you can find that head of Napa cabbage, says in the long run, consumers will feel the impact of fewer farm workers.
[01:27:08.333 --> 01:27:09.874]  The supply is going to be down.
[01:27:09.894 --> 01:27:11.434]  Demand is going to be up.
[01:27:14.014 --> 01:27:15.055]  It's going to increase.
[01:27:15.195 --> 01:27:16.376]  It will increase a lot.
[01:27:17.397 --> 01:27:25.662]  Ed, we spoke to two grocery chains today, Zanotto's and Whole Foods, and they say they have yet to see increased prices for produce because of farm labor shortages.
[01:27:26.083 --> 01:27:27.624]  Daniel Garza, NBC11 News.
[01:27:28.084 --> 01:27:29.745]  Alright, now that's one out of California.
[01:27:29.765 --> 01:27:36.370]  The other news announcements, and I've only got them in text here, say prices up because of lack of farm workers.
[01:27:37.799 --> 01:27:39.740]  I've seen the actual studies.
[01:27:40.321 --> 01:27:42.322]  I've actually gone and looked into this years ago.
[01:27:42.903 --> 01:27:47.526]  A fraction of the cost is even the growing it, the entire process.
[01:27:48.366 --> 01:27:50.208]  I mean, they sell bushels of wheat.
[01:27:50.348 --> 01:28:00.375]  They sell cabbages for literal pennies, and then you pay three bucks for the head of lettuce or cabbage at the store.
[01:28:01.528 --> 01:28:04.750]  And my family has been in agriculture for a long time.
[01:28:05.211 --> 01:28:06.531]  I also know about it from that angle.
[01:28:06.912 --> 01:28:10.294]  The farmer gets a fraction of the money.
[01:28:10.754 --> 01:28:11.935]  A fraction!
[01:28:12.896 --> 01:28:18.259]  But they've had the studies where in a big box of cereal, the farmer got 25 cents.
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:20.201]  That came out a few years ago.
[01:28:21.121 --> 01:28:22.082]  They had examples of it.
[01:28:22.102 --> 01:28:24.363]  19 cents for this box, 30 cents for that box.
[01:28:24.944 --> 01:28:25.284]  Again!
[01:28:25.584 --> 01:28:27.926]  But they know the public doesn't know stuff like that!
[01:28:29.733 --> 01:28:33.097]  And now I gotta hear idiot yuppies walking around going, thanks a lot!
[01:28:33.397 --> 01:28:35.419]  Food prices are up because of you people!
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:38.903]  Food prices are up because the dollar's being devalued!
[01:28:39.644 --> 01:28:40.305]  That's why!
[01:28:43.848 --> 01:28:44.789]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:46.872]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.793 --> 01:28:50.496]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:55.982]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[01:28:56.343 --> 01:28:59.406]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:28:59.666 --> 01:29:04.231]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:29:04.612 --> 01:29:07.214]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:29:07.695 --> 01:29:14.442]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:29:14.882 --> 01:29:15.563]  We're good to go!
[01:29:44.326 --> 01:29:45.947]  Call 800 and get SFR now!
[01:29:46.187 --> 01:29:46.588]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:29:46.628 --> 01:29:46.968]  That's 888-873-7371 today!
[01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:56.652]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:29:56.812 --> 01:30:02.017]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:30:02.337 --> 01:30:07.622]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:30:08.042 --> 01:30:09.183]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:09.544 --> 01:30:18.492]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:30:18.772 --> 01:30:18.832]  Yes!
[01:30:18.852 --> 01:30:20.454]  Now compare a Kalben Pure Soap.
[01:30:20.694 --> 01:30:24.859]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[01:30:53.698 --> 01:30:59.203]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:30:59.623 --> 01:31:03.867]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:31:04.288 --> 01:31:11.154]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:11.574 --> 01:31:18.283]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:18.603 --> 01:31:20.225]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:31:20.525 --> 01:31:23.709]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:26.453]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:31:26.753 --> 01:31:27.875]  BioSolutions has over 550
[01:31:29.016 --> 01:31:29.937]  We're good to go.
[01:31:54.975 --> 01:31:55.456]  Uh-huh.
[01:32:03.373 --> 01:32:08.815]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[01:32:08.835 --> 01:32:14.236]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[01:32:14.276 --> 01:32:16.737]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[01:32:16.997 --> 01:32:19.398]  There wasn't by as many as there was a while ago.
[01:32:19.458 --> 01:32:24.659]  We fired once more and they began to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:32:27.601 --> 01:32:49.162]  We looked down a river and we see the British come And there must have been a hundred of them beatin' on the drums They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring We stood beside our cotton fields and didn't say a thing We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they began to runnin' On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[01:32:53.363 --> 01:32:54.725]  We can take them by surprise.
[01:32:54.805 --> 01:32:57.467]  If we didn't fire muskies, still we looked them in the eye.
[01:32:57.687 --> 01:33:00.170]  We held our fire till we see their faces well.
[01:33:00.210 --> 01:33:03.233]  Then we opened up the swirl guns and really gave them well.
[01:33:03.333 --> 01:33:06.616]  We fired our guns and the pretty step was coming.
[01:33:06.636 --> 01:33:09.098]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[01:33:09.139 --> 01:33:11.781]  We fired once more and they began to run it.
[01:33:11.821 --> 01:33:14.283]  From down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:33:18.717 --> 01:33:19.277]  I think so.
[01:33:33.675 --> 01:33:35.917]  That is quality music, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:35.957 --> 01:33:37.438]  As usual, dedicated to the Watson Brothers.
[01:34:00.803 --> 01:34:02.243]  I gotta have some fun, I'm sorry.
[01:34:02.263 --> 01:34:16.411]  I remember being a little kid, and I had that little record, it was a smaller one, I forget what you called those.
[01:34:17.292 --> 01:34:22.354]  And I had a bunch of old country records, the good stuff, the country, super gold.
[01:34:23.195 --> 01:34:26.516]  They call stuff from the 80's now country gold, but I mean stuff from the 40's, 50's, 60's.
[01:34:28.490 --> 01:34:32.593]  And I remember listening to that, and North to Alaska, and Big John and all that.
[01:34:34.695 --> 01:34:36.696]  And I probably shouldn't even play those.
[01:34:36.736 --> 01:34:40.239]  Last time I played one of the other ones, people thought it was Secret Code or something.
[01:34:40.279 --> 01:34:41.380]  Goodness gracious.
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:43.701]  Just having some fun, folks.
[01:34:45.543 --> 01:34:49.686]  Lately, I'm going to be honest with you, and I keep saying this, and you probably notice the difference.
[01:34:49.826 --> 01:34:51.027]  I've really got a bad feeling.
[01:34:52.127 --> 01:34:56.751]  And I've been saying this for about three or four months, and you notice what's happening to the dollar.
[01:34:58.027 --> 01:35:02.691]  But my instinct that really bad stuff's coming doesn't go away with that.
[01:35:05.833 --> 01:35:07.314]  It just intensifies.
[01:35:08.995 --> 01:35:13.779]  It just... I don't like this disquieting feeling.
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:17.061]  I don't like the incredible concern I have.
[01:35:17.862 --> 01:35:21.304]  For all the bad things that are going on and happening right now, it's something else.
[01:35:23.698 --> 01:35:29.040]  My gut has never been wrong before and I just, it's kind of like a hurry up and get it over with.
[01:35:29.741 --> 01:35:31.442]  It's the quiet before the storm.
[01:35:33.142 --> 01:35:37.164]  I think the New World Order is getting ready to unleash something really bad.
[01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:39.445]  Something horrible this way comes, they say.
[01:35:42.607 --> 01:35:45.108]  And I just burn with desire.
[01:35:45.988 --> 01:35:48.049]  I burn with passion.
[01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:52.331]  With tectonic passion.
[01:35:53.286 --> 01:35:58.888]  To be able to reach out to my fellow human beings, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, I don't care.
[01:35:58.908 --> 01:36:01.709]  If you got green skin, you're a human being.
[01:36:06.791 --> 01:36:21.196]  I just wish I could get the general public, who know they're being lied to and have the same feeling of disquiet, of unease, but they still, if they had any idea how bad it is, just how far
[01:36:22.026 --> 01:36:24.568]  Down this dark road we've gone.
[01:36:25.129 --> 01:36:26.250]  We could turn this around.
[01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:28.412]  And that's what makes me mad.
[01:36:28.912 --> 01:36:36.038]  To realize they've got hundreds of media channels 24-7 pumping out propaganda, pumping out spin, pumping out bull.
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:43.645]  And they're making human clones and already using them for genetic material and body parts and emitting it.
[01:36:44.606 --> 01:36:48.349]  And they're already engaged in every form of genetic engineering and
[01:36:49.102 --> 01:36:51.685]  Stuff that totally endangers the entire planet.
[01:36:52.226 --> 01:37:02.337]  Meanwhile, mindless liberals are running around in patchouli oil, feeling good, trying to steal farmers' and ranchers' property and working for the big banks, and they don't even know it.
[01:37:02.397 --> 01:37:03.218]  They don't even mean it.
[01:37:03.758 --> 01:37:04.479]  They're good people.
[01:37:04.499 --> 01:37:05.260]  They're just idiots.
[01:37:07.333 --> 01:37:21.861]  And they're setting up all this new global carbon tax, carbon footprint regulation, which is a tax on breathing, a tax on all human activities, social workers and regulators and swarms of new agencies and agents to eat out our substance.
[01:37:22.201 --> 01:37:26.823]  I mean, everything we've seen is only the prelude.
[01:37:27.824 --> 01:37:30.025]  It's only the beginning.
[01:37:31.366 --> 01:37:34.268]  And I see the New World Order keep their promises.
[01:37:34.408 --> 01:37:36.370]  I see them do everything they say they're going to do.
[01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:39.593]  They may be a few years behind doing it, but they don't stop.
[01:37:39.653 --> 01:37:40.894]  They are hell-bent for leather.
[01:37:42.094 --> 01:37:49.941]  And they just keep driving, keep pushing inexorably towards their world government and their bloodbath.
[01:37:50.701 --> 01:37:59.368]  And they say they want the world government, and once they get it in place, it isn't people walking around in glistening silver spacesuits and flying around on jetpacks and
[01:38:00.197 --> 01:38:13.502]  You know, and futuristic garden-topped skyscrapers and bubble fountains and, you know, bimbos and little gold outfits running around like some 50's science fiction movie.
[01:38:14.162 --> 01:38:21.685]  It's hardcore, controlled bio-plagues, mass exterminations, robotic armies.
[01:38:21.705 --> 01:38:22.966]  It's just, it's horrible.
[01:38:23.126 --> 01:38:24.226]  It's absolutely horrible.
[01:38:24.246 --> 01:38:27.387]  And I know a lot of you aren't going to listen.
[01:38:27.407 --> 01:38:29.168]  You've just got to see it all happen to you.
[01:38:30.643 --> 01:38:44.368]  As it gets worse and worse, right through to the end, there'll be all these fake preachers running around saying, hallelujah, it's the Lord, and that the world leader has risen and is our Jesus, and I'll have to, they'll all be completely bought and paid for, and all these church ladies buying it.
[01:38:48.549 --> 01:38:53.871]  We have found the YouTube video, CNN edited it out, Fox admitting one currency.
[01:38:54.352 --> 01:38:58.333]  Have you transmitted that, my comrade, to the network in Minnesota?
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:01.361]  Now again, I don't yell at Aaron.
[01:39:01.861 --> 01:39:03.982]  People are saying, well you didn't used to hear this yelling.
[01:39:04.443 --> 01:39:05.483]  Aaron used to be in another room.
[01:39:05.563 --> 01:39:11.086]  Now he's right out the window, out of my broadcast studio, at a desk, and he can't hear me.
[01:39:11.126 --> 01:39:11.727]  I'm looking at him.
[01:39:12.367 --> 01:39:12.907]  Aaron!
[01:39:14.388 --> 01:39:15.049]  Thank you, thank you.
[01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:16.489]  I need a little pager out there.
[01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:19.111]  Hey, hey bro, how you doing?
[01:39:19.611 --> 01:39:21.172]  Did you IM that to the network?
[01:39:21.972 --> 01:39:22.513]  Okay, John.
[01:39:22.553 --> 01:39:22.933]  Okay, great.
[01:39:22.973 --> 01:39:23.994]  John, are you grabbing that right now?
[01:39:24.034 --> 01:39:24.354]  Thank you.
[01:39:27.776 --> 01:39:28.096]  Anyways.
[01:39:29.227 --> 01:39:30.468]  Give it to Watson, too.
[01:39:31.809 --> 01:39:33.511]  While he's red-coating around over there.
[01:39:35.052 --> 01:39:36.433]  I've seen that affectionately, folks.
[01:39:36.513 --> 01:39:37.474]  I tease people I like.
[01:39:37.534 --> 01:39:38.254]  I like the Watsons.
[01:39:38.274 --> 01:39:39.195]  They're really great people.
[01:39:47.802 --> 01:39:49.484]  Folks, I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:39:49.624 --> 01:39:52.126]  I don't even want to cover these stacks of horrible news.
[01:39:54.105 --> 01:39:58.187]  I mean, this is the Austin American Statesman, they're gonna put toll roads everywhere, and they lied about it.
[01:39:58.227 --> 01:39:59.207]  Of course they lied!
[01:39:59.227 --> 01:40:01.748]  And then there'll be no discussion in the media!
[01:40:02.228 --> 01:40:05.950]  The headlines should talk about how the Campo Board lied!
[01:40:06.370 --> 01:40:08.951]  How they didn't pass a toll road moratorium!
[01:40:12.873 --> 01:40:13.673]  That's what I mean!
[01:40:13.733 --> 01:40:15.454]  It's just, everything is insane!
[01:40:17.628 --> 01:40:23.231]  Alright, I had Cryer coming on this segment and I moved him back to the last 30 minutes of the show because I wanted you to have a chance to call in.
[01:40:48.575 --> 01:40:48.875]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:40:48.895 --> 01:40:49.476]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:40:49.496 --> 01:40:56.180]  You can talk about whatever you want.
[01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:56.821]  I don't care.
[01:40:56.841 --> 01:41:07.428]  It'd be nice if you called in with actual issues instead of COINTELPRO ninnying about which group someone's in or which ninny festival they're part of.
[01:41:07.448 --> 01:41:07.508]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:41:16.585 --> 01:41:17.505]  Just look at all this.
[01:41:17.805 --> 01:41:21.727]  I mean, I talked about it yesterday and I just feel moved to talk about frequency pollution.
[01:41:22.507 --> 01:41:24.647]  I'm going to set up a bunch of guests in the next few months on that.
[01:41:24.687 --> 01:41:29.729]  I want to create a big vaccine awareness section on Prison Planet and InfoWars to actually save lives.
[01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:32.390]  But I've got to have the time to post it all up there.
[01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:36.151]  All the fact that there is no law, I've got to take shots, and the fact that mercury is still in there.
[01:41:36.891 --> 01:41:42.753]  And the videos and our electron microscopes of what mercury does to your neurons and your brain and all these things I want to do.
[01:41:42.813 --> 01:41:43.873]  I just want to warn people.
[01:41:45.655 --> 01:41:54.563]  The main thing that freaks me out is that I have this feeling, not of futility, I have this feeling of grief and sadness.
[01:41:56.585 --> 01:41:58.767]  And I know we're going to win in the end with God's help.
[01:41:59.327 --> 01:42:00.669]  I know the good guys win in the end.
[01:42:00.749 --> 01:42:04.152]  It's just that it shouldn't be so hard.
[01:42:04.252 --> 01:42:08.396]  I mean, the corruption is out in the open!
[01:42:10.017 --> 01:42:11.499]  It's not hard to know!
[01:42:12.774 --> 01:42:15.955]  To watch my country being destroyed right in front of me!
[01:42:17.315 --> 01:42:23.057]  I can't wake... I can't wake the dumb yuppies up because they're so full of themselves, stumbling around.
[01:42:23.297 --> 01:42:25.638]  They're white, they're successful, they're the elite.
[01:42:25.798 --> 01:42:26.558]  You're nothing!
[01:42:27.139 --> 01:42:30.820]  You're just high-paid peons who are being raped behind your back.
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:34.401]  I can't communicate with illegal aliens.
[01:42:34.441 --> 01:42:35.681]  I don't even speak their language.
[01:42:35.721 --> 01:42:36.882]  It's a cultural thing.
[01:42:37.122 --> 01:42:38.882]  They're being pig-headed and won't listen.
[01:42:39.462 --> 01:42:41.043]  They're gonna be totally destroyed.
[01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:44.151]  We're all going to be destroyed together!
[01:42:44.191 --> 01:42:45.552]  You just need to know that!
[01:42:46.833 --> 01:42:49.174]  And all I want to do is stop the New World Order!
[01:42:49.454 --> 01:42:51.055]  Psychopathic killers!
[01:42:51.375 --> 01:42:52.756]  Sworn to hurt us!
[01:42:53.397 --> 01:42:54.898]  Sworn to rule on us!
[01:42:55.398 --> 01:42:57.199]  Sworn to make war on us!
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:01.161]  On our families, on our cultures, on anything sovereign!
[01:43:05.704 --> 01:43:08.986]  I forget which founding father it was that pledged eternal
[01:43:10.251 --> 01:43:13.253]  Resistance to tyranny, but I already pledged that.
[01:43:14.454 --> 01:43:20.878]  I mean, I just pledge that I am never going to give up, and I am never going to stop.
[01:43:22.739 --> 01:43:25.420]  And I'm going to keep trying to give people the best advice I can.
[01:43:25.941 --> 01:43:30.023]  You know, I was watching videos of Ed Brown late last night, and I got so depressed.
[01:43:30.884 --> 01:43:35.307]  I was watching him at that press conference, one of the press conferences he gave, and he's just a sweet little man.
[01:43:35.327 --> 01:43:37.408]  I know he's a good person.
[01:43:39.139 --> 01:43:45.382]  And, um, you know, I tried to keep my mouth shut when I knew they were making all these mistakes.
[01:43:46.883 --> 01:43:50.905]  And then I had to watch them, you know, have all this done to them.
[01:43:52.246 --> 01:43:54.207]  And the Fed's getting away with all this evil.
[01:43:55.148 --> 01:44:00.751]  But then I have to go on air and warn you about all these fake legal arguments and stuff that isn't gonna work.
[01:44:00.771 --> 01:44:06.754]  I mean, Larry Becraft actually wins federal cases over and over again against the income tax.
[01:44:07.722 --> 01:44:11.345]  He tried to, for free, represent the Browns, and they didn't listen to him.
[01:44:11.805 --> 01:44:12.886]  They listened to quacks!
[01:44:14.047 --> 01:44:17.750]  But still, we support them, even though no one ever takes our advice.
[01:44:18.391 --> 01:44:21.213]  And if that's criticism of the Browns, then so be it.
[01:44:21.253 --> 01:44:22.154]  It's not criticism.
[01:44:22.594 --> 01:44:31.882]  I don't want my listeners to listen to these charlatans in other areas and go file liens on people, the Browns didn't do that, and all that other stuff, and go to jail.
[01:44:32.583 --> 01:44:34.744]  I don't want to watch you fall in the pits.
[01:44:34.824 --> 01:44:38.765]  That's all I do is try to give you my experience.
[01:44:39.906 --> 01:44:44.448]  If you learn from others' experiences, you don't have to fall in the pits yourself.
[01:44:48.029 --> 01:44:50.370]  And I'm so upset about the Browns.
[01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:52.130]  I mean, I am upset about it.
[01:44:54.771 --> 01:44:55.812]  I know it's a fraud.
[01:44:55.892 --> 01:44:56.912]  I know it's horrible.
[01:44:57.292 --> 01:45:01.094]  I am upset that
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:13.024]  They are going into the Free State Project in New Hampshire and harassing these great young people and others that all they did was stand up for the Browns and speak out to show how the income tax is a fraud and an offshore scam.
[01:45:13.644 --> 01:45:14.704]  And to have them harassed.
[01:45:14.724 --> 01:45:15.685]  And look at the video.
[01:45:15.705 --> 01:45:18.046]  There's video up on Prison Planet of these federal marshals.
[01:45:18.486 --> 01:45:19.226]  Their faces.
[01:45:24.128 --> 01:45:30.770]  And again, I'm sick of watching the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and the Dutch royal family and the British royal family
[01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:35.686]  And a handful of other groups always get away with it.
[01:45:35.766 --> 01:45:36.847]  Bush gets the blame.
[01:45:36.907 --> 01:45:38.167]  Hillary gets the blame.
[01:45:38.787 --> 01:45:40.348]  The federal marshals get the blame.
[01:45:40.368 --> 01:45:41.868]  And I'm not saying they shouldn't get the blame.
[01:45:41.888 --> 01:45:42.548]  They're culpable.
[01:45:43.689 --> 01:45:45.089]  But they're the low-level people.
[01:45:48.930 --> 01:45:55.412]  And I'm just tired of watching these New World Order people arrogantly get away with lying to people and hurting people.
[01:45:56.391 --> 01:46:10.663]  And putting all these good people in prison, and to know that we've... They're gonna double the number of cops again, and put even more people in prison, and the whole country's just unraveling, and everything's a scam, and they're stealing, and robbing, and lying, and... I never got to this Monday.
[01:46:10.703 --> 01:46:12.064]  I covered it some Sunday night.
[01:46:12.184 --> 01:46:18.489]  I've watched Chris Matthews of Hardball get up on Jon Stewart.
[01:46:19.145 --> 01:46:28.953]  And say lying is good, and being fake is good, and that's what everything is about in life, is being like a liar like Bill Clinton, and that's how you get the job, how you get the girl.
[01:46:29.353 --> 01:46:30.094]  No, it isn't!
[01:46:30.895 --> 01:46:32.276]  You know, we're a culture of lies.
[01:46:32.296 --> 01:46:35.839]  That's why you buy a hoe, you buy a shovel, you buy a hammer, and it breaks.
[01:46:36.119 --> 01:46:37.000]  They didn't use to!
[01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:40.603]  You stick a shovel in the ground and it just bends!
[01:46:41.443 --> 01:46:44.946]  It looks good, it's got some fancy paint on it, but it's built!
[01:46:45.487 --> 01:46:46.888]  It's like a piece of junk!
[01:46:52.668 --> 01:46:55.430]  I mean, you don't get a good woman putting on a front.
[01:46:55.450 --> 01:46:59.132]  You're gonna get some hollow idiot, just like yourself.
[01:47:01.013 --> 01:47:02.474]  A real woman's got discernment.
[01:47:04.495 --> 01:47:05.375]  Has a sixth sense.
[01:47:07.677 --> 01:47:08.257]  Intuition.
[01:47:09.738 --> 01:47:11.799]  I don't want to be around a nation of fake people.
[01:47:13.527 --> 01:47:26.657]  I couldn't imagine being one of these yuppies who likes to go to parties and have people look up to him and pull up in a perfectly waxed car and get out with a perfect waistline and go up with, you know, liposuction and strut around all pontificating.
[01:47:26.697 --> 01:47:27.438]  None of that's real.
[01:47:27.718 --> 01:47:29.079]  I want to be with real people.
[01:47:29.339 --> 01:47:31.021]  I want to be involved in real things.
[01:47:31.581 --> 01:47:36.765]  I want to be involved with people that have heart and duty and honor and passion like Edna Lane Brown.
[01:47:38.026 --> 01:47:40.428]  And then I have to watch people like them who I admire
[01:47:41.212 --> 01:47:42.893]  Still fall down and make mistakes.
[01:47:43.053 --> 01:47:44.093]  I admire the courage.
[01:47:46.635 --> 01:47:55.198]  I can't even talk bad about anything they did because they had guts and guts is enough, but it's still painful to watch them fall right into the jaws of the enemy.
[01:47:55.939 --> 01:48:00.801]  They took the field, but didn't put on the armor.
[01:48:06.946 --> 01:48:08.867]  When we get back, we have the Vicente Fox clip.
[01:48:09.187 --> 01:48:10.768]  We'll play it, and we'll start the next hour.
[01:48:10.808 --> 01:48:11.948]  I'll take 30 minutes of calls.
[01:48:12.728 --> 01:48:13.529]  And I mean it this time.
[01:48:13.549 --> 01:48:14.929]  I'm giving each person 60 seconds.
[01:48:14.949 --> 01:48:17.250]  I don't care how good the phone call is, and I'm moving to the next person.
[01:48:17.791 --> 01:48:20.312]  I've got to learn to have some control and actually do what I'll say I'll do.
[01:48:20.332 --> 01:48:20.392]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:48:24.471 --> 01:48:28.695]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.net.
[01:48:29.215 --> 01:48:32.277]  TruthNews.us is the most pretty site we've got.
[01:48:32.718 --> 01:48:35.160]  It's got the most news on it of any site we've got.
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:37.982]  I'm really proud of what Kurt Nemo's doing over there.
[01:48:39.303 --> 01:48:44.568]  It's getting a lot of traffic, but it's not getting what it needs, and I want you everybody to tell everybody about TruthNews.us.
[01:48:45.769 --> 01:48:52.294]  Kurt also did WhatIsTheEndGame.com and EndGameTheMovie.com, and they all deserve to be seen.
[01:48:52.334 --> 01:48:53.395]  By the way, EndGame is
[01:48:54.989 --> 01:48:59.732]  Gonna be shipping out at the end of this month, and if you pre-order now, you'll be the first people to get it.
[01:49:01.294 --> 01:49:02.635]  And it really is my best film.
[01:49:02.715 --> 01:49:03.375]  It's amazing.
[01:49:05.296 --> 01:49:07.278]  But it's still 2 hours 20 minutes long.
[01:49:07.458 --> 01:49:18.686]  Oh, by the way, the extras are, I don't know, 40-something minutes, and one of them's a 19-minute mini-doc called Battle for the Republic about the Illegal Aliens and the New World Order, and that old piece of the puzzle we couldn't put in the film.
[01:49:18.706 --> 01:49:19.487]  It'd have been too long.
[01:49:19.507 --> 01:49:21.208]  It's really just a segment from the film.
[01:49:22.815 --> 01:49:24.736]  And then there's a bunch of other stuff in there too.
[01:49:25.616 --> 01:49:34.799]  Secret agents following Jim Tucker around in Istanbul and Jimmy Vaughn playing shackles on me at Texas Independence Day.
[01:49:34.819 --> 01:49:37.980]  I hope you'll get it.
[01:49:40.141 --> 01:49:46.383]  I just wish I had the force to somehow move people's minds and reach people.
[01:49:47.104 --> 01:49:48.364]  But we don't reach enough people.
[01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:51.961]  But we are reaching more because of you.
[01:49:52.201 --> 01:49:52.861]  Spread the word.
[01:49:57.023 --> 01:50:02.485]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.846 --> 01:50:10.449]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.181 --> 01:50:18.224]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.624 --> 01:50:30.009]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.369 --> 01:50:33.931]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.291 --> 01:50:36.552]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.592 --> 01:50:40.454]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:58.871]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:50:59.051 --> 01:51:01.132]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:51:01.372 --> 01:51:08.493]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:51:08.633 --> 01:51:20.136]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:51:20.536 --> 01:51:27.921]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for a flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[01:51:28.181 --> 01:51:33.184]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[01:51:33.324 --> 01:51:38.327]  Disconnect your application, and the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[01:51:38.627 --> 01:51:43.931]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4444.
[01:51:50.193 --> 01:51:56.215]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[01:51:56.755 --> 01:51:58.235]  After a pedicure they look great.
[01:51:58.595 --> 01:52:02.416]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[01:52:02.856 --> 01:52:05.057]  Haven't you heard about Calrex Ointment?
[01:52:05.477 --> 01:52:08.818]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:52:09.218 --> 01:52:11.679]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:52:12.179 --> 01:52:13.179]  What's that name again?
[01:52:13.618 --> 01:52:14.779]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:16.381]  It's Callex.
[01:52:16.762 --> 01:52:18.604]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:52:18.945 --> 01:52:20.787]  What makes Callex ointment so different?
[01:52:21.576 --> 01:52:30.198]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:52:30.618 --> 01:52:36.340]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:47.863]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Schneider's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:52:48.522 --> 01:52:49.643]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[01:52:49.963 --> 01:52:50.644]  I'll be right back.
[01:52:50.744 --> 01:52:52.486]  I'm getting some calix for my heels.
[01:53:01.414 --> 01:53:07.399]  Some folks are born with a silver spoon in their hand.
[01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:11.423]  Some folks are born with an extra way to fly.
[01:53:18.622 --> 01:53:26.403]  If we don't get the word out fast, if we don't educate the public, we're going down.
[01:53:49.881 --> 01:53:58.087]  And when the United States falls, the entire world will fall into literal darkness.
[01:53:58.128 --> 01:54:05.914]  How do we get the message out to the Mexicans that the New World Order is using them as a tool, a knife, to slit the throat of this country?
[01:54:21.631 --> 01:54:25.798]  How do we convince the yuppies that the Republicans aren't their gods?
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:28.082]  And that they're dirty traitors?
[01:54:28.843 --> 01:54:30.566]  Crank it up, I love this part.
[01:54:34.955 --> 01:54:35.115]  More.
[01:54:35.315 --> 01:54:39.779]  If you don't pay more, more, more.
[01:54:41.019 --> 01:54:45.503]  We'll send SWAT teams to your house.
[01:55:02.985 --> 01:55:04.565]  Drag you off to federal prison.
[01:55:04.725 --> 01:55:11.847]  Alright, here's the Jacinthe Fox clip.
[01:55:13.267 --> 01:55:14.607]  C.I.A.
[01:55:16.708 --> 01:55:18.228]  Secret Service.
[01:55:18.248 --> 01:55:20.089]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to the next thing.
[01:55:23.989 --> 01:55:26.350]  Here is the traitor, the enemy.
[01:55:27.739 --> 01:55:33.523]  Larry King live, who sits up there and pushes his New World Order agenda with Vicente Fox admitting they wanted to create an Amero.
[01:55:34.763 --> 01:55:40.667]  And all of the Americans, for all of the Americas, just as they're doing for the North American Union, here it is.
[01:55:41.917 --> 01:55:46.019]  Do you fear that part of the legal immigration problem is terrorism?
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:47.560]  Ah, no.
[01:55:48.221 --> 01:55:48.681]  Not at all.
[01:55:48.741 --> 01:55:50.242]  It's a totally different business.
[01:55:50.462 --> 01:55:51.603]  Absolutely different.
[01:55:51.623 --> 01:55:53.684]  You don't equate the two?
[01:55:53.904 --> 01:55:55.065]  Absolutely not.
[01:55:55.165 --> 01:55:58.066]  Email from Mrs. Gonzalez in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
[01:55:58.186 --> 01:56:04.350]  Mr. Fox, I'd like to know how you feel about the possibility of having a Latin America united with one currency.
[01:56:05.797 --> 01:56:07.398]  Long term, very long term.
[01:56:07.458 --> 01:56:15.041]  What we proposed together, President Bush and myself, is ALCA, which is a trade union for all of the Americas.
[01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:19.824]  And everything was running fluently until Hugo Chavez came.
[01:56:20.004 --> 01:56:22.545]  And he decided to isolate himself.
[01:56:23.105 --> 01:56:27.147]  He decided to combat the idea and destroy the idea.
[01:56:27.247 --> 01:56:29.428]  Unfortunately, like the Eurodollar, you mean?
[01:56:30.128 --> 01:56:31.649]  Well, that would be long, long term.
[01:56:32.424 --> 01:56:37.849]  I think the process is to go first step into a trading agreement.
[01:56:38.089 --> 01:56:41.973]  And then further on, a new vision, like we're trying to do with NAFTA.
[01:56:45.596 --> 01:56:46.737]  You heard it right there.
[01:56:48.158 --> 01:56:52.562]  So, of course it's in all the official documents, but the public won't read documents.
[01:56:53.964 --> 01:56:56.786]  And all I can say is, thank God for Hugo Chavez.
[01:56:56.866 --> 01:56:58.648]  I mean, you can say whatever you want about the guy.
[01:56:59.867 --> 01:57:03.671]  But if it wasn't for him, folks, they'd already have us in a Pan-American Union.
[01:57:04.812 --> 01:57:10.718]  As it is, we're just here merging with Mexico and Canada and desperately trying to warn the public.
[01:57:11.058 --> 01:57:17.205]  You go demonstrate against it, the cops come up and start fights with other cops so they can fire rubber bullets on the peaceful crowd.
[01:57:17.245 --> 01:57:17.445]  I mean,
[01:57:18.644 --> 01:57:21.065]  This is absolute criminality in everybody's face.
[01:57:21.105 --> 01:57:22.926]  That link's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:57:22.986 --> 01:57:23.947]  We have the story.
[01:57:24.307 --> 01:57:28.649]  Paul Watson's got a hard-hitting story up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:57:28.749 --> 01:57:30.830]  Get it and get it out to everybody.
[01:57:34.172 --> 01:57:38.394]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:54.405]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:55.046 --> 01:57:55.867]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.608 --> 01:57:57.549]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.190 --> 01:58:02.114]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.375 --> 01:58:06.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.883 --> 01:58:14.907]  We are now into our number three wide open phones.
[01:58:14.967 --> 01:58:24.715]  Tons of other news I haven't covered and the gentleman who was found not guilty of tax evasion will be represented by Larry Becraft coming up in 30 minutes, Mr. Cryer.
[01:58:25.255 --> 01:58:27.597]  Charles in Louisiana, go ahead my friend, welcome.
[01:58:29.219 --> 01:58:29.459]  Hello?
[01:58:29.779 --> 01:58:30.420]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:33.162]  Yeah, Mr. Jones, appreciate what you're doing, sir.
[01:58:33.891 --> 01:58:36.813]  But the problem is the American people don't have no more guts.
[01:58:37.113 --> 01:58:39.634]  If they know or not, they're domesticated.
[01:58:39.734 --> 01:58:41.175]  They're going to be just like the Jews.
[01:58:42.156 --> 01:58:48.460]  You know, they wanted Jews for years and years, but they wanted to make the money and whatever, and they walked right into the camps.
[01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:50.021]  We're doing the same thing.
[01:58:50.341 --> 01:58:54.963]  American, they just domesticated fools.
[01:58:55.404 --> 01:58:58.265]  And I appreciate you every day fighting for them.
[01:58:58.546 --> 01:59:00.727]  You fight more for them than they fight for themselves.
[01:59:01.187 --> 01:59:02.588]  Like them two girls that got raped.
[01:59:02.964 --> 01:59:05.066]  How many of our women are going to have to be raped?
[01:59:05.106 --> 01:59:09.591]  How many of our children are going to be hurt until we start standing up just for our families?
[01:59:09.891 --> 01:59:12.174]  The American people don't even stand up for their families.
[01:59:13.515 --> 01:59:13.976]  I know this.
[01:59:14.116 --> 01:59:17.519]  They had me lined up about to run me into a pit and shoot me in the back of the head.
[01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:20.863]  I've watched RAW hour after hour of that original film footage.
[01:59:21.724 --> 01:59:23.566]  I've got a bunch of archival footage for Endgame.
[01:59:24.315 --> 01:59:26.056]  I guarantee I'd at least attack the guards.
[01:59:26.396 --> 01:59:28.678]  I mean, they've subdued me and got me to a facility.
[01:59:28.718 --> 01:59:32.020]  At least when they ordered me to run into a pit and be shot, I'd have fought the guards.
[01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:34.681]  But you're a man, I mean... Well, I'm not a man.
[01:59:34.722 --> 01:59:36.943]  I mean, my gosh, if I'm going to die, I might as well attack them.
[01:59:36.983 --> 01:59:37.863]  But look at the public.
[01:59:37.923 --> 01:59:40.105]  I mean, the men are almost like feminine.
[01:59:40.265 --> 01:59:48.930]  They talk a good game, but they're still... Well, but women will actually fight, and we always say effeminate, and I say that too, but it's more than that.
[01:59:48.990 --> 01:59:50.071]  It's like they're jellyfish.
[01:59:50.331 --> 01:59:52.012]  Yeah, they love football games.
[01:59:52.052 --> 01:59:54.154]  The women's got more on the ball than men.
[01:59:54.894 --> 01:59:55.475]  And it's the truth.
[01:59:55.535 --> 01:59:56.515]  I'm not trying to knock them.
[01:59:56.856 --> 02:00:01.419]  I'm here with the American people, and I think they deserve everything they're getting because of their cowardness.
[02:00:01.739 --> 02:00:02.700]  God hates cowards.
[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:03.200]  Do you know that?
[02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:04.521]  God hates a coward.
[02:00:06.963 --> 02:00:13.187]  Well, I'm just upset thinking about Ed and Elaine Brown for no reason for not paying taxes the private fellows deserve in prison.
[02:00:14.147 --> 02:00:16.648]  And I guess the American people are going to forget about them, you know?
[02:00:17.088 --> 02:00:18.788]  And if something happened to you, they'll forget about you.
[02:00:19.009 --> 02:00:21.389]  The American people have a short memory, Mr. Jones.
[02:00:21.729 --> 02:00:23.830]  But I thank you for being a true American.
[02:00:24.170 --> 02:00:25.551]  And you, my friend, because of that.
[02:00:25.811 --> 02:00:27.231]  And I pray for you a lot.
[02:00:27.251 --> 02:00:28.772]  Well, I just do my job, Charles.
[02:00:28.832 --> 02:00:30.472]  I pray for everybody, too, and I pray for you.
[02:00:30.512 --> 02:00:31.072]  God bless you.
[02:00:31.433 --> 02:00:32.333]  God bless you, sir.
[02:00:32.493 --> 02:00:32.953]  Take care.
[02:00:33.273 --> 02:00:34.373]  Look, I want to make it clear.
[02:00:36.634 --> 02:00:39.115]  I disagree how the Brown situation was handled.
[02:00:43.058 --> 02:00:46.041]  I disagree with what happened with those folks.
[02:00:46.641 --> 02:00:49.724]  I think there were really dark forces around the Browns manipulating them.
[02:00:51.105 --> 02:00:52.126]  Something stinks there.
[02:00:52.767 --> 02:00:53.968]  I have no doubt they're good.
[02:00:53.988 --> 02:01:02.395]  And I know that they didn't take advice from people who have got a track record of knowing what they're doing.
[02:01:03.296 --> 02:01:04.377]  I'm not blaming them.
[02:01:04.437 --> 02:01:07.980]  I'm saying we can learn from what happens to others.
[02:01:14.841 --> 02:01:24.089]  I just, it did not help the Browns to talk about shooting into the woods when anybody came on the property, or booby traps, or going after people in reprisals.
[02:01:25.330 --> 02:01:28.172]  That was guaranteed to make the Feds go in there.
[02:01:30.835 --> 02:01:35.999]  Guaranteed to, I mean I'm surprised that they ended it without somebody being killed.
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:40.363]  The Feds in the old days, I mean just a few years ago, would have gone in and burned that place out.
[02:01:41.596 --> 02:01:42.757]  Because they're pretty cowardly.
[02:01:42.797 --> 02:01:47.840]  Generally, they're cowardly and they go on with armored vehicles with infantry maneuvers and burn that place down and blow it up.
[02:01:48.961 --> 02:01:55.064]  This is the first time I've even seen the Feds do something brave.
[02:01:55.565 --> 02:01:57.966]  And please don't come back and say, oh, you're calling the Feds brave.
[02:01:58.767 --> 02:02:01.869]  Look, whenever the first thing was hijackers did 9-11, I knew it wasn't.
[02:02:02.409 --> 02:02:03.490]  But they were calling them cowards.
[02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:07.092]  And I said, if you believe the hijacker story, they're not cowards.
[02:02:07.732 --> 02:02:10.754]  To go hijack a plane and fly it into buildings is not cowardly.
[02:02:11.457 --> 02:02:12.398]  You can call it evil.
[02:02:12.418 --> 02:02:13.679]  You can call it psychopathic.
[02:02:14.079 --> 02:02:16.561]  And again, I'm not saying that's true.
[02:02:16.881 --> 02:02:18.663]  I'm not saying that's not what really happened.
[02:02:19.063 --> 02:02:20.404]  I'm saying even with the official story.
[02:02:21.085 --> 02:02:22.246]  Well, it's the same thing with the feds.
[02:02:22.306 --> 02:02:26.309]  I mean, normally they cowardly burn down a structure.
[02:02:26.969 --> 02:02:32.914]  And those guys went in there when Brown was swearing to blast anybody that did and got him.
[02:02:35.256 --> 02:02:37.598]  So it ended badly, but not as bad as it could have ended.
[02:02:38.298 --> 02:02:38.799]  But I just
[02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:42.558]  It's so sad to see Ed and Elaine go to prison.
[02:02:46.858 --> 02:02:55.925]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:02:56.186 --> 02:03:07.415]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:03:07.755 --> 02:03:12.579]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[02:03:12.799 --> 02:03:12.959]  I think?
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:32.260]  We're good.
[02:03:48.735 --> 02:03:54.220]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:54.580 --> 02:04:02.227]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.904 --> 02:04:09.967]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:10.367 --> 02:04:21.792]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:22.092 --> 02:04:25.654]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:26.054 --> 02:04:27.995]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:28.335 --> 02:04:32.177]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:45.629 --> 02:04:49.893]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:04:50.153 --> 02:04:55.017]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:04:55.257 --> 02:04:56.598]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:04:56.758 --> 02:05:00.121]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:05:11.890 --> 02:05:14.332]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[02:05:20.537 --> 02:05:21.478]  No animal testing.
[02:05:21.738 --> 02:05:23.039]  I use them and love them.
[02:05:23.059 --> 02:05:24.681]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.

[02:05:37.851 --> 02:05:44.377]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:05:46.699 --> 02:05:52.244]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:09.111 --> 02:06:14.135]  It doesn't matter if you're an old white man or a young black man.
[02:06:14.155 --> 02:06:19.280]  It doesn't matter if you live in Mexico City or New York City or London, England.
[02:06:20.521 --> 02:06:22.243]  The New World Order is your enemy.
[02:06:22.784 --> 02:06:25.566]  The New World Order manipulates different groups against each other.
[02:06:26.067 --> 02:06:27.288]  The New World Order
[02:06:28.067 --> 02:06:29.768]  Must be resisted, and it's real simple.
[02:06:30.188 --> 02:06:36.592]  Whatever the media is pushing, whatever the media is saying, basically just be for the opposite and you're going to be in the right place.
[02:06:36.612 --> 02:06:42.135]  I mean, they've got so many layers of spin and fraud and lies.
[02:06:43.636 --> 02:06:51.021]  Here's an example again, today's example, they keep saying on the news everywhere, oh, food prices are up because the illegal aliens have been deported.
[02:06:51.481 --> 02:06:53.102]  A, the illegal aliens haven't been deported.
[02:06:54.531 --> 02:06:57.133]  30-something thousand of 3 million new each year.
[02:06:57.153 --> 02:06:58.674]  30 plus million here.
[02:06:58.714 --> 02:06:59.214]  Give me a break.
[02:06:59.655 --> 02:07:00.175]  Not even 1%.
[02:07:01.296 --> 02:07:02.737]  A. That's not true.
[02:07:03.978 --> 02:07:07.200]  B. The food prices are up because the dollar's been devalued.
[02:07:08.781 --> 02:07:09.161]  What next?
[02:07:09.181 --> 02:07:12.063]  They're going to say deporting illegal aliens made gas prices go up?
[02:07:15.606 --> 02:07:16.547]  And that's what I mean though.
[02:07:16.567 --> 02:07:18.888]  The general public is defenseless against this.
[02:07:18.928 --> 02:07:19.709]  They've watched that.
[02:07:20.289 --> 02:07:24.172]  And even though they know the media lies, they still don't know specifically what the lies are.
[02:07:28.712 --> 02:07:29.612]  I want to take your calls.
[02:07:29.672 --> 02:07:31.534]  It's just sometimes my head actually spins.
[02:07:33.135 --> 02:07:44.043]  By the way, if you want to see Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, you'll be able to see it first on the web at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:08:36.495 --> 02:08:38.296]  Endgame, ladies and gentlemen, Endgame.
[02:08:40.318 --> 02:08:40.718]  Endgame.
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:47.103]  You can pre-order DVDs now, they'll be shipping out on or before November 1st.
[02:08:47.544 --> 02:08:51.327]  That way, if you pre-order Endgame now, you will get it first to your door.
[02:08:53.067 --> 02:08:55.770]  And it is the Globalist Master Plan, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:55.870 --> 02:08:59.974]  It goes through the history of the New World Order, how they operate, their current operations.
[02:09:00.014 --> 02:09:03.637]  We go cover two Bilderberg Group meetings in Canada and in Turkey.
[02:09:05.959 --> 02:09:07.501]  And that's just the first part of the film.
[02:09:07.621 --> 02:09:14.627]  Then we go into the eugenics and the Master Extermination Plan with all the documents and all the video.
[02:09:14.707 --> 02:09:16.209]  And it's unbelievably powerful.
[02:09:16.809 --> 02:09:18.531]  And it's darker than pitch.
[02:09:19.790 --> 02:09:22.172]  I mean, people say, well, what are solutions at the end?
[02:09:22.212 --> 02:09:24.214]  Hey, man, no one's ever put it together like this.
[02:09:24.494 --> 02:09:26.376]  The solution is you now know.
[02:09:27.537 --> 02:09:30.660]  I mean, my gosh, it's hard enough to research all this and just present it.
[02:09:30.700 --> 02:09:31.901]  It took 14 months.
[02:09:36.825 --> 02:09:46.154]  And let me tell you, knowing the stuff you're going to learn when you get this film, I mean, not just hearing me chirp about it, but seeing it and having it, up on whatistheendgame.com, up on the website.
[02:09:47.139 --> 02:10:01.668]  We've got an in-game in the news, in-game news, with just the globalists saying, oh, we want to kill everybody, get rid of everybody, humans are a disease, humans are a virus, you know, the new global warming craze, we're going to use that to regulate everybody's lives and one-child policies.
[02:10:01.988 --> 02:10:03.309]  I mean, it's happening, okay?
[02:10:03.349 --> 02:10:07.091]  This is a perfect time for this film to come out, and you've got to warn people!
[02:10:09.352 --> 02:10:13.455]  I mean, it's almost abnormal for me to just sit up here calmly and cover this.
[02:10:13.815 --> 02:10:16.617]  The news is so out of control, it's so dire,
[02:10:17.515 --> 02:10:20.076]  And then people say, oh, that's hyperbole, things aren't that bad.
[02:10:20.116 --> 02:10:20.816]  Yes, they are!
[02:10:20.836 --> 02:10:24.638]  No, the people running the global government are psychopathic killers!
[02:10:32.020 --> 02:10:33.461]  I am really sick of it.
[02:10:33.481 --> 02:10:35.881]  Alright, who's up first here?
[02:10:35.942 --> 02:10:36.902]  Who's up first here?
[02:10:38.182 --> 02:10:40.123]  Joe in Wisconsin, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:10:41.043 --> 02:10:42.824]  Hey Alex, working with you all the way.
[02:10:43.524 --> 02:10:45.805]  I need your expertise as an oil family.
[02:10:46.331 --> 02:10:51.194]  Have you ever heard of global warming and peak oil in the same discussion?
[02:10:52.735 --> 02:11:01.060]  Well, as an oil family, I know that family worked as roughnecks and worked in refineries and petroleum geologists, but I wouldn't call us an oil family.
[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:04.202]  That would have like a Dallas TV show view of it.
[02:11:05.543 --> 02:11:12.027]  But certainly, I mean, not just from that, from the government documents, from the lawsuit documents, from oil companies,
[02:11:13.347 --> 02:11:22.312]  We know what's going on in the whole petroleum global system, but you're saying, have I ever heard of global warming and peak oil in the same sentence?
[02:11:22.552 --> 02:11:23.753]  I don't really get what you're saying.
[02:11:24.413 --> 02:11:29.115]  Well, if we do have peak oil, doesn't it solve the global warming problem?
[02:11:29.276 --> 02:11:34.818]  I mean, if it all is being depleted, then we shouldn't have global warming.
[02:11:34.999 --> 02:11:35.859]  It'll solve itself.
[02:11:36.559 --> 02:11:39.401]  So why are you pushing the global carbon tax?
[02:11:41.027 --> 02:11:43.308]  Well, again, they're saying they're not going to stop there.
[02:11:43.368 --> 02:11:55.870]  They're saying micromanagement, everybody cutting, everybody getting used to cutting, everyone being forced to cut, being penalized for having more than one child, not being able to build a big house, not being able to add on.
[02:11:56.331 --> 02:11:59.671]  All the harassment farmers and ranchers have had will now be for everybody.
[02:12:00.071 --> 02:12:06.713]  Secret police, little tattletale squads, environmental police in every town and city in Hamlet.
[02:12:07.313 --> 02:12:20.684]  I mean, we have the Dutch Royal Shell documents 12 years ago, where they financed Russians and others to put out news that there was no new oil, and when their own oil company documents show record fines everywhere, and it's all racial scarcity, shutting down supplies.
[02:12:22.065 --> 02:12:30.452]  What they're doing is they're pricing oil in peak oil costs, and then they're going to put the carbon tax in relation to global warming.
[02:12:31.809 --> 02:12:34.330]  They can't both occur at the same time.
[02:12:34.510 --> 02:12:36.311]  One of them is an out-and-out lie.
[02:12:36.431 --> 02:12:42.613]  They're actually both lies, but they cannot, with a straight face, say, we're going to have peak oil.
[02:12:43.193 --> 02:12:44.534]  Oh, and now we need a carbon tax.
[02:12:44.734 --> 02:12:46.935]  You can't do them both at the same time.
[02:12:46.955 --> 02:12:48.195]  It just does not work.
[02:12:48.435 --> 02:12:49.856]  You can catch them in their own lie.
[02:12:50.056 --> 02:12:51.977]  Yeah, but that's common sense.
[02:12:52.037 --> 02:12:52.957]  I appreciate your call.
[02:12:53.897 --> 02:13:01.020]  I mean, you've got a public where they're putting the transponder readers in on the existing roads and announcing it, and then they go, well, this is a
[02:13:02.347 --> 02:13:04.448]  Taxation lane, not a toll lane!
[02:13:04.468 --> 02:13:07.330]  I mean, they just... That's what I mean!
[02:13:07.390 --> 02:13:11.211]  It's just... It's crazy!
[02:13:11.231 --> 02:13:12.352]  I mean, they just lie!
[02:13:12.392 --> 02:13:13.513]  It's unbelievable!
[02:13:14.533 --> 02:13:16.394]  And then watch how their spin works now.
[02:13:16.794 --> 02:13:17.795]  Like, take the war.
[02:13:19.175 --> 02:13:28.480]  They're now depoliticizing the Iraq war and saying, well, the Democrats are now for the war, and Democrats now don't care because they're about to be in power, and so the war will just continue on, and...
[02:13:29.477 --> 02:13:38.745]  We're getting back to traditional Democratic issues, and Bush is appointing former Clinton officials, so everybody's... I mean, it's just all sick.
[02:13:38.845 --> 02:13:39.506]  It's just sick.
[02:13:40.386 --> 02:13:41.788]  I probably shouldn't even be on the air today.
[02:13:41.828 --> 02:13:43.189]  I've been in a real bad mood lately.
[02:13:49.574 --> 02:13:52.317]  I'm just so tired of having to explain it to people.
[02:13:53.738 --> 02:13:55.039]  It's so obvious.
[02:14:03.083 --> 02:14:03.904]  Who's up next now?
[02:14:07.447 --> 02:14:09.128]  Jane in Idaho, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:14:09.689 --> 02:14:17.935]  Yeah, was it General Franks that said that the next big terrorist act, apparently the machinery was in place for martial law?
[02:14:18.116 --> 02:14:21.498]  Yeah, it was that piece of trash.
[02:14:22.519 --> 02:14:28.364]  Well, I mean, you know, whatever else, but what's your feeling?
[02:14:30.550 --> 02:14:34.474]  Do you think that perhaps there are agent provocateurs?
[02:14:34.554 --> 02:14:37.016]  I know... was it McNichols?
[02:14:37.036 --> 02:14:39.758]  McNichols and McVeigh?
[02:14:39.778 --> 02:14:49.046]  McNichols taught... Were you on a George Noory program discussing this and McNichols wanted the public forum to talk about how he was entrapped in that whole thing?
[02:14:49.946 --> 02:14:53.089]  Yeah, and how they were in black ops.
[02:14:53.269 --> 02:14:57.293]  McVeigh, we already knew that separately, was in black ops and was
[02:14:58.536 --> 02:15:00.017]  Part of a federal operation.
[02:15:00.698 --> 02:15:01.658]  You know about that, right?
[02:15:02.439 --> 02:15:06.882]  Well, it was, I was trying to think, was it Representative, was his name Key?
[02:15:06.922 --> 02:15:09.224]  Somebody down there in... Charles Key.
[02:15:09.704 --> 02:15:16.029]  Yeah, from the legislature down there in Oklahoma apparently had researched that.
[02:15:17.110 --> 02:15:21.053]  But there wasn't much discussion.
[02:15:21.353 --> 02:15:25.136]  I noticed that they buried Nichols after that.
[02:15:26.730 --> 02:15:31.114]  Apparently they didn't want him getting any public exposure.
[02:15:31.134 --> 02:15:33.477]  Harry, I appreciate your call.
[02:15:34.418 --> 02:15:36.900]  That wasn't Charles Key putting that on.
[02:15:37.701 --> 02:15:42.525]  That was Jesse Trinidou, the lawyer.
[02:15:42.606 --> 02:15:45.849]  His brother was kidnapped and tortured and killed by the feds.
[02:15:47.566 --> 02:15:58.510]  And then in his lawsuit, he got documents from the Southern Poverty Law Center, not from them, but it came out in FBI documents, where they were basically running Elohim Shitty, the white supremacist compound.
[02:16:01.372 --> 02:16:08.054]  And McVeigh had told Nichols that he was in black ops, and that they were setting him up.
[02:16:09.315 --> 02:16:14.357]  But we already knew that separately, outside of that, from the state police, and the detectives, and other people.
[02:16:16.309 --> 02:16:23.751]  I mean, see, that's the problem with people's minds, is that if I even try to get into Oklahoma City, I have to go through all the evidence.
[02:16:23.831 --> 02:16:34.273]  I don't want to just make a tertiary announcement about Oklahoma City being a government bombing without going through the evidence of it, which takes hours to cover.
[02:16:40.274 --> 02:16:41.174]  That's the bottom line.
[02:16:43.425 --> 02:16:47.907]  We have psychopathic killers, and when I say psychopathic killers, I want that term to sink in.
[02:16:48.547 --> 02:16:57.830]  Psychopathic killers running the government who could set off nukes, release bio-weapons at any time.
[02:16:59.070 --> 02:17:02.251]  They carried out the first World Trade Center attack on record.
[02:17:03.151 --> 02:17:05.552]  They carried out Oklahoma City on record.
[02:17:06.233 --> 02:17:08.333]  They carried out 9-11 on record.
[02:17:08.873 --> 02:17:09.814]  They carried out 7-7 on record.
[02:17:11.357 --> 02:17:13.438]  They staged the Gulf of Tonkin on record.
[02:17:13.899 --> 02:17:16.300]  They wrote up Operation Northwoods on record.
[02:17:17.661 --> 02:17:21.143]  And that's my point, is this isn't a game or a joke!
[02:17:22.944 --> 02:17:24.605]  This isn't a joke!
[02:17:25.226 --> 02:17:26.727]  You little soft people!
[02:17:30.369 --> 02:17:39.675]  You cops out there that think you're part of a good system, and think you're part of something good, you're part of a worm-eaten rotten carcass that is America!
[02:17:40.979 --> 02:17:42.020]  You just better know that!
[02:17:45.423 --> 02:17:50.648]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:17:50.788 --> 02:17:58.896]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:17:59.136 --> 02:18:06.183]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:18:06.363 --> 02:18:07.284]  We're good to go!
[02:18:35.626 --> 02:18:37.168]  Call now and get free shipping!
[02:18:44.975 --> 02:18:47.236]  This is a market alert from Midas Resources.
[02:18:47.636 --> 02:18:57.599]  Since August 9th, the Fed has created and injected $200 billion into the financial markets to keep them afloat, ignoring the hyperinflationary hangover that is the sure result.
[02:18:58.099 --> 02:19:03.640]  Data released by the New York Federal Reserve shows that foreign central banks have cut their stash of U.S.
[02:19:03.700 --> 02:19:10.362]  Treasuries by $48 billion since late July, with falls of $32 billion in the last two weeks alone.
[02:19:10.862 --> 02:19:12.883]  Could China be quietly dumping the dollar?
[02:19:13.829 --> 02:19:20.935]  The quality of your life depends on the quality of your currency, and the quality of the dollar is poor, because the quantity is so high.
[02:19:21.315 --> 02:19:27.100]  Printing money on a thin air has disastrous results, victimizing middle class citizens and discouraging savings.
[02:19:27.661 --> 02:19:32.144]  If you have been considering precious metals as a hedge against inflation, you need to act now.
[02:19:32.565 --> 02:19:35.127]  Procrastination is the mother of lost opportunities.
[02:19:35.587 --> 02:19:37.209]  Call me, Tom Andrew at 1-800-606-1294.
[02:19:37.289 --> 02:19:37.490]  That's 1-800-606-1294.

[02:20:45.419 --> 02:20:47.922]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:48.462 --> 02:20:53.107]  Did you know there's a secret group that wants the government to spend itself in the bankruptcy?
[02:20:53.467 --> 02:20:59.773]  Did you know that current President Bush has the largest percentage of increase in spending than any Democrat has ever had?
[02:20:59.793 --> 02:21:03.357]  38% higher than Bill Clinton's highest budget.

[02:21:56.382 --> 02:22:06.026]  You know, I shouldn't get down if people aren't waking up and fighting back.
[02:22:06.566 --> 02:22:09.228]  I just, we tend to settle into our comfortable lives.
[02:22:09.248 --> 02:22:13.049]  We tend to compartmentalize what's happening in the world around us.
[02:22:13.189 --> 02:22:24.774]  And I'm telling you folks, if you're not freaked out, if fighting this new world order isn't the main focus of your life, if this isn't the main issue, there's something wrong with you.
[02:22:25.948 --> 02:22:30.610]  We are in desperate, desperate straits.
[02:22:31.170 --> 02:22:34.451]  And I get upset by our country being destroyed.
[02:22:35.631 --> 02:22:36.392]  I can't help it.
[02:22:37.992 --> 02:22:39.753]  A lot of people just become used to it.
[02:22:39.813 --> 02:22:41.033]  They become accustomed to it.
[02:22:41.093 --> 02:22:43.854]  They become acclimated, climatized.
[02:22:44.054 --> 02:22:44.514]  Not me.
[02:22:44.715 --> 02:22:48.796]  I am not going along with the destruction of my precious republic.
[02:22:50.248 --> 02:22:52.831]  Because they're not replacing it with something good, folks.
[02:22:52.851 --> 02:22:54.653]  They're replacing it with something really bad.
[02:22:54.673 --> 02:22:55.935]  And I know I'm all over the map here.
[02:22:55.955 --> 02:22:57.757]  I keep getting confused on who to go to next.
[02:22:57.777 --> 02:22:58.118]  Who's up?
[02:22:58.458 --> 02:22:59.599]  Is Dave in Canada next?
[02:23:02.142 --> 02:23:03.524]  Dave in Canada, you're on the air.
[02:23:03.584 --> 02:23:03.944]  Welcome.
[02:23:05.727 --> 02:23:05.967]  Alex.
[02:23:06.427 --> 02:23:06.708]  Yes, sir.
[02:23:07.949 --> 02:23:08.310]  How are you?
[02:23:08.610 --> 02:23:08.830]  Good.
[02:23:08.890 --> 02:23:09.231]  Go ahead.
[02:23:10.270 --> 02:23:10.430]  Good.
[02:23:11.230 --> 02:23:13.271]  Yeah, I have a few things to mention.
[02:23:13.431 --> 02:23:17.413]  I'm on the Windsor, Ontario-Detroit border here, and we have a few things here going on.
[02:23:17.433 --> 02:23:26.096]  The Mexican problem, we have a lot of Mexicans coming in, and the other thing I want to talk about, or like to talk about, or if you don't have enough time, is Canada.
[02:23:26.196 --> 02:23:31.018]  This last year, a gentleman by the name of Plunder, he won a tax case against the government of Canada.
[02:23:32.138 --> 02:23:36.800]  He won basically saying that, or they found that he was not guilty of tax evasion.
[02:23:37.779 --> 02:23:47.146]  Well, I don't know which one you would want to discuss really fast, but, um, I think the tax evasion one and the Mexican, both of those issues line up with what you're speaking about right now, right?
[02:23:47.887 --> 02:23:48.307]  Go ahead.
[02:23:49.508 --> 02:24:00.456]  Okay, so, what do you think is, um, uh, like, what do you think the, uh, the tax evasion case in Canada would, I don't, it wouldn't have any direct effect on the U.S.
[02:24:00.516 --> 02:24:06.321]  Well, you're under Magna Carta, but the public isn't aware of it, so, um,
[02:24:07.179 --> 02:24:14.864]  I mean, I'm not too familiar with crown laws under all of that, so I don't really know what to say to you.
[02:24:16.885 --> 02:24:18.746]  Well, how about the Mexican issue?
[02:24:19.326 --> 02:24:23.249]  What do you think Canada's role is playing in the New World Order?
[02:24:23.949 --> 02:24:26.250]  I know Canada doesn't let Europeans immigrate.
[02:24:26.290 --> 02:24:29.072]  It's actually impossible, but they'll let anybody from anywhere else.
[02:24:29.452 --> 02:24:30.693]  It's all part of the New World Order plan.
[02:24:32.904 --> 02:24:45.330]  That's just how they operate and I know I've seen in Canadian papers that Canadians are freaking out because there's hundreds of thousands of Mexicans in the last year that came in they're driving the wages down to nothing and the government rolling out the red carpet.
[02:24:46.330 --> 02:24:51.953]  Yeah there's a big problem here in Windsor over that a lot of Mexicans coming in and they're coming from Florida actually.
[02:24:55.414 --> 02:25:01.538]  And the other thing is, yeah, the police state, too, they had a big problem in Quebec with the agents provocateurs.
[02:25:02.919 --> 02:25:04.520]  So that's another thing that's happening in Canada.
[02:25:04.540 --> 02:25:05.841]  But they got caught.
[02:25:05.881 --> 02:25:06.942]  See, they got caught.
[02:25:07.402 --> 02:25:08.303]  And so that's the point.
[02:25:08.543 --> 02:25:12.686]  We're catching the criminals, we're exposing the criminals, and they will be brought to justice.
[02:25:12.766 --> 02:25:13.726]  I appreciate your call, Dave.
[02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:21.612]  Go ahead, Alyssa from Kansas City, go ahead.
[02:25:22.245 --> 02:25:22.845]  Yes, Alex.
[02:25:23.465 --> 02:25:33.808]  I was on the internet the other day and ran across an article, this was posted October 3rd, about the biggest terrorism exercise ever that is supposed to take place next week.
[02:25:34.188 --> 02:25:37.349]  I was just wondering what information you had on that.
[02:25:37.930 --> 02:25:50.033]  According to what they had on the article, it talks about a dirty bomb going off at Cabris Power Plant in Guam, one going off on the Steel Bridge in Portland, Oregon,
[02:25:50.675 --> 02:25:55.742]  And also another one at the intersection of 101 and 202 highways in Phoenix.
[02:25:56.523 --> 02:26:01.070]  And I was just wondering, this was supposedly a document that had been obtained by the Associated Press.
[02:26:01.530 --> 02:26:06.157]  I was just wondering what your feeling was about that and if you think this is something we need to be watching closely.
[02:26:07.614 --> 02:26:29.463]  Well, A, we should watch all drills, and yes, I'm aware of it, because the globalists like to stage their terror attacks on top of drills that always mirror the exact attack pattern they launch, and that's in case compartments of the police apparatus and security apparatus catch the other black ops squad staging the attack, they can simply say, oh no, that was part of the drill.
[02:26:32.526 --> 02:26:42.369]  Secondarily, these drills are caused for local news to then create the illusion of a real terror threat and to train everyone to go under federal control and martial law.
[02:26:43.350 --> 02:26:46.351]  And so that's another reason they carry these out.
[02:26:47.751 --> 02:26:48.131]  I see.
[02:26:48.191 --> 02:26:49.592]  Well, thank you for the information.
[02:26:49.632 --> 02:26:51.132]  Thank you for holding to ask that.
[02:26:52.072 --> 02:26:52.933]  Thank you so much.
[02:26:53.953 --> 02:26:56.614]  John in Michigan and others, we'll get to you coming up here.
[02:26:57.779 --> 02:26:58.419]  In a few minutes.
[02:26:58.980 --> 02:27:08.183]  The big news today is that Vicente Fox on Larry King Live last night, by the way he broke the story here, of course he saw it and has written an article about it.
[02:27:08.223 --> 02:27:12.505]  We got it up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[02:27:14.045 --> 02:27:20.548]  One of the other websites we've just launched, trying to expand our attack profile on the InfoWars.
[02:27:21.258 --> 02:27:22.019]  TruthNews.us.
[02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:28.305]  I'd hope that you'd help us somehow get the word about TruthNews.us.
[02:27:28.365 --> 02:27:32.789]  It's a really easy to use, prolific website with Curt Nemo heading it up.
[02:27:35.672 --> 02:27:36.633]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.653 --> 02:27:38.675]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.576 --> 02:27:42.299]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.327 --> 02:27:46.868]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.
[02:27:47.148 --> 02:27:52.670]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.

[02:28:01.554 --> 02:28:05.196]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs.
[02:28:05.516 --> 02:28:09.157]  Two books that combined are over a thousand pages and other information.

[02:28:12.779 --> 02:28:16.760]  That's mostholyfamilymonastery.com.
[02:28:17.020 --> 02:28:20.922]  The last word monastery is spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y.
[02:28:21.242 --> 02:28:21.702]  Or call us at 1-800-275-1126.
[02:28:21.722 --> 02:28:21.922]  That's 1-800-275-1126.
[02:28:29.165 --> 02:28:29.686]  We're good to go.
[02:28:45.087 --> 02:28:46.929]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:28:47.069 --> 02:28:52.253]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:28:52.413 --> 02:28:53.754]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:28:54.034 --> 02:29:02.220]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:29:02.441 --> 02:29:08.145]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:29:08.325 --> 02:29:10.087]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:29:10.167 --> 02:29:12.309]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:29:12.349 --> 02:29:16.713]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:29:16.873 --> 02:29:19.035]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:29:19.115 --> 02:29:26.942]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:29:27.022 --> 02:29:27.462]  We're good.
[02:29:44.452 --> 02:29:49.375]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:29:49.695 --> 02:29:51.576]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:29:51.776 --> 02:29:54.818]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:29:54.998 --> 02:29:58.140]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:29:58.440 --> 02:30:00.301]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[02:30:00.561 --> 02:30:04.265]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:30:04.545 --> 02:30:07.207]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:30:07.227 --> 02:30:12.112]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:30:12.332 --> 02:30:16.616]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:30:17.037 --> 02:30:21.361]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, packet B, the unholy alliance.
[02:30:21.681 --> 02:30:23.703]  These materials document the global leaders,
[02:30:23.883 --> 02:30:26.505]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:00.524 --> 02:31:06.548]  Tom Cryer just beat the New World Order, exposed their fraudulent income tax system.
[02:31:06.568 --> 02:31:12.732]  I'm going to get his take briefly on what happened to him versus the way the Browns handle things.
[02:31:15.163 --> 02:31:21.064]  But before we do that, efoodsdirect.com is the website for the J. Michael Stevens Group online.
[02:31:21.544 --> 02:31:32.906]  If you go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com, there's big giant banners on the top of each page, and that is our biggest and best sponsor, and they're wonderful folks who I've got storable foods from two separate times.
[02:31:32.926 --> 02:31:35.627]  I'm about to get some more from them because I gave some of the food to family.
[02:31:37.427 --> 02:31:41.048]  It's just super high quality, and with the things going on in the world today,
[02:31:42.559 --> 02:31:43.259]  It's simple.
[02:31:43.319 --> 02:31:43.920]  You're nuts.
[02:31:44.380 --> 02:31:45.060]  You're insane.
[02:31:46.180 --> 02:31:58.785]  If you don't have at least a two-month food supply for each member of your family, and it's a lot less expensive to buy it in a storable food format than the crud you try to save and keep, it lasts ten years, it's high quality, 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:06.776 --> 02:32:09.438]  eFoodsDirect.com is the website.
[02:32:09.798 --> 02:32:11.059]  They can use food as a weapon.
[02:32:11.079 --> 02:32:11.499]  The U.N.
[02:32:11.519 --> 02:32:12.239]  says they will.
[02:32:13.040 --> 02:32:20.104]  I don't know if we're going into martial law, New World Order, or depression, but I know there's a good chance the next ten years we probably will.
[02:32:21.885 --> 02:32:24.387]  Unfortunately, I almost break down and cry when I say that.
[02:32:24.847 --> 02:32:27.309]  I can't believe we have to go through this.
[02:32:27.329 --> 02:32:29.750]  You're insane if you don't get storable foods.
[02:32:29.790 --> 02:32:31.151]  That's really all I can say to you.
[02:32:33.718 --> 02:32:37.041]  On top of that, I want to tell you about the Liberty Dollar, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:32:39.083 --> 02:32:43.607]  You can get the regular Liberty Dollars with a Ron Paul Dollar at RonPaulDollar.net.
[02:32:44.808 --> 02:32:53.896]  And beautiful silver coins, beautiful gold coins, bronze rounds, and with Ron Paul double stamped affixed on the front.
[02:32:55.103 --> 02:33:00.946]  And just go look at them at RonPaulDollar.net or there's a link on PrisonPlanet.com if you forget the website address.
[02:33:01.486 --> 02:33:02.006]  Or call them.
[02:33:02.026 --> 02:33:03.827]  They can answer your questions and take your order.
[02:33:03.847 --> 02:33:05.168]  888-LIB-DOLLAR.
[02:33:05.548 --> 02:33:08.789]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you and some of the proceeds go to Ron Paul's campaign.
[02:33:08.809 --> 02:33:10.430]  888-LIB-DOLLAR.
[02:33:10.450 --> 02:33:12.951]  888-421-6181.
[02:33:12.971 --> 02:33:18.333]  And the Liberty Dollar folks expose the whole fraudulent Federal Reserve System.
[02:33:18.354 --> 02:33:19.454]  They've been around a long time.
[02:33:19.914 --> 02:33:21.035]  And it's just beautiful coins.
[02:33:21.275 --> 02:33:23.276]  So, RonPaulDollar.net.
[02:33:29.561 --> 02:33:31.963]  I am enraged by what's happening in this country.
[02:33:31.983 --> 02:33:34.845]  I am enraged by the New World Order running its operations.
[02:33:34.885 --> 02:33:41.190]  But I should be happy, and we all really should be positive and happy, because we know the New World Order plan.
[02:33:41.450 --> 02:33:43.811]  That means we can make provisions against it.
[02:33:45.753 --> 02:33:50.056]  And no one ever, it was very rare, won cases against the IRS.
[02:33:50.811 --> 02:33:53.932]  Because they wouldn't let the juries hear about how there is no law.
[02:33:53.952 --> 02:33:56.392]  They wouldn't let the juries find out about how it's all offshore scams.
[02:33:58.472 --> 02:34:00.733]  They wouldn't let the juries learn about the Federal Reserve.
[02:34:02.393 --> 02:34:05.814]  Or the fact that our country ran without the income tax for hundreds of years before that.
[02:34:08.834 --> 02:34:14.496]  But now, we've educated enough people, we're in federal case after federal case after federal case after federal case.
[02:34:15.236 --> 02:34:16.956]  The government, the criminals, are losing.
[02:34:19.751 --> 02:34:22.673]  And there was just nine defendants found not guilty.
[02:34:22.693 --> 02:34:25.415]  They had to mistrial, drop it, depending on which trial it was.
[02:34:26.016 --> 02:34:27.517]  But everybody was found not guilty.
[02:34:27.597 --> 02:34:28.617]  That's basically what happened.
[02:34:30.099 --> 02:34:31.740]  Different ways they, quote, got off.
[02:34:32.540 --> 02:34:35.362]  Because it came out there that it was all a big scam, what the government was doing.
[02:34:35.963 --> 02:34:42.227]  Same thing happened with Mr. Cryer, who's a lawyer himself, represented by Larry Becraft.
[02:34:43.208 --> 02:34:46.610]  And Joe Bannister, the treasury agent, who found out it was all a fraud, went public.
[02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:47.291]  They arrested him.
[02:34:49.162 --> 02:34:53.526]  And so they're on the run, and I know Larry B. Crabb and others tried to give the Browns advice.
[02:34:54.246 --> 02:34:56.689]  They chose another path, and God bless them.
[02:34:56.729 --> 02:35:07.418]  I mean, they're great people, and I'm so sad to see them now in the belly of the beast, under the wings of the New World Order's black deviltry.
[02:35:08.499 --> 02:35:17.226]  But you might, I thought, want to hear from somebody who actually beat the enemy.
[02:35:18.607 --> 02:35:20.508]  And I appreciate Tom Cryer coming on with us.
[02:35:20.548 --> 02:35:21.388]  Tom, good to talk to you.
[02:35:21.888 --> 02:35:22.449]  Good to be here.
[02:35:22.529 --> 02:35:23.609]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:35:23.909 --> 02:35:32.273]  You know we don't have a lot of time, so if you want to give out any websites or any phone numbers, any contact info... Get the plugging out of the way right away?
[02:35:32.693 --> 02:35:33.773]  No, no.
[02:35:33.793 --> 02:35:39.235]  I mean that so we make sure and get that out, because I want people to check out what you and Larry and others are putting out.
[02:35:39.255 --> 02:35:42.797]  And then on top of it, if you could just, in a nutshell, your case, and then
[02:35:43.337 --> 02:35:44.738]  Give us your take on the Browns, please.
[02:35:44.758 --> 02:35:53.185]  All right, well, we'll begin with just websites for so that we'll be sure that people can go get the information that even what I'm going to talk about here and much, much more.
[02:35:54.325 --> 02:35:59.469]  The initial website that gives a background of my case is LieFreeZone.com.
[02:36:00.390 --> 02:36:02.331]  LieFreeZone.com, one word.
[02:36:03.232 --> 02:36:07.335]  And it gives a background of the case and it gives updates up until the trial.
[02:36:07.415 --> 02:36:10.818]  And then by this time, I had launched
[02:36:11.428 --> 02:36:22.757]  A nationwide campaign called TruthAttack.org in an effort to educate the public, make this a public issue rather than a public novelty.
[02:36:23.558 --> 02:36:29.182]  Only a very few people are aware, percentage-wise, of the truth about the income tax.
[02:36:29.903 --> 02:36:40.932]  And once people do become aware, it's going to be very, very difficult for the government to get a conviction against any of the patriots that are out there standing their ground on the law.
[02:36:41.784 --> 02:36:43.485]  But it's going to take an educated public.
[02:36:43.565 --> 02:36:46.967]  It's going to take a public that's aware that these aren't frivolous arguments.
[02:36:46.987 --> 02:36:48.547]  These are genuine arguments.
[02:36:48.627 --> 02:36:49.808]  This is a genuine law.
[02:36:50.088 --> 02:36:50.888]  It's a real deal.
[02:36:51.889 --> 02:36:57.312]  And until they realize that, they're going to believe what they're told, because official and true still mean the same to them.
[02:36:58.572 --> 02:37:05.035]  And they don't realize that the government is... Everybody knows the government will lie to us, but not about something like that, right?
[02:37:05.496 --> 02:37:06.136]  I didn't believe it.
[02:37:07.356 --> 02:37:10.198]  And so, you know, we've launched truth attacks.
[02:37:10.885 --> 02:37:18.648]  In order to do exactly what you touched on at the initial part of this segment, and that is to make it difficult or impossible for the government to convict people.
[02:37:19.108 --> 02:37:28.491]  But for every person you say that gets acquitted, there's a hundred, at least, that are going into what you described as the belly of the beast and can't be described any better than that.
[02:37:28.511 --> 02:37:35.153]  Are becoming political prisoners, locked away for disagreeing with their almighty government.
[02:37:36.454 --> 02:37:39.515]  And they're getting the truth out.
[02:37:40.629 --> 02:37:42.811]  It's going to be the solution.
[02:37:42.851 --> 02:37:48.455]  Just like inability to get convictions for prohibition violations ended prohibition.
[02:37:49.196 --> 02:37:54.640]  It wasn't just that it wasn't a popular law, it was that they couldn't enforce it.
[02:37:56.061 --> 02:37:57.122]  Same thing will happen here.
[02:37:57.222 --> 02:38:05.329]  Once you pull the bee's teeth by preventing him from being able to put people in prison for disagreeing or for pointing out the truth,
[02:38:06.366 --> 02:38:06.967]  I don't think so.
[02:38:24.258 --> 02:38:35.307]  You do have an awful lot of mythology out there, and I wasn't aware of that.
[02:38:35.848 --> 02:38:42.933]  I was confronted with one particular claim, and that was that there was no liability provision, and therefore the income tax was voluntary.
[02:38:43.554 --> 02:38:51.020]  I set out to disprove that, to prevent a friend of mine from getting in trouble because he had decided that because he had heard this,
[02:38:51.852 --> 02:38:54.015]  He was going to quit filing tax returns.
[02:38:54.035 --> 02:38:55.638]  I didn't want him getting in trouble.
[02:38:56.159 --> 02:38:57.881]  I knew there had to be a liability provision.
[02:38:58.682 --> 02:39:04.311]  Well, it didn't take me long to realize that I ended up going through the code, page by page, section by section.
[02:39:05.006 --> 02:39:08.789]  Before I finally had to admit that there wasn't a liability provision.
[02:39:09.409 --> 02:39:13.632]  There are tons of liability provisions for every single tax except for the income tax.
[02:39:14.093 --> 02:39:22.359]  And in the case of the income tax there is a liability provision, but it only applies to those who are required to withhold taxes on non-residential units and foreign corporations.
[02:39:22.379 --> 02:39:22.359]  1461.
[02:39:22.659 --> 02:39:29.644]  So, when I made that realization, I knew something was bad wrong.
[02:39:30.535 --> 02:39:33.297]  Now I knew the government was lying to us in a big, big way.
[02:39:33.417 --> 02:39:34.818]  A trillion dollars a year away.
[02:39:35.999 --> 02:39:37.700]  And so I started digging into it.
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:38.701]  I had to understand it.
[02:39:39.222 --> 02:39:41.463]  And when I dug into it, I got the real law.
[02:39:41.984 --> 02:39:42.684]  I wasn't out.
[02:39:42.724 --> 02:39:43.945]  I had no axe to grind.
[02:39:44.605 --> 02:39:46.467]  I wasn't trying to prove one thing or another.
[02:39:46.527 --> 02:39:48.408]  I was trying to discover what the truth was.
[02:39:49.409 --> 02:39:54.613]  I wasn't trying to invent something so that I could make up a special formula of snake oil and sell it on the internet either.
[02:39:56.184 --> 02:39:56.824]  We're good to go.
[02:39:56.844 --> 02:39:57.425]  We're good to go.
[02:40:25.197 --> 02:40:32.923]  Until I figured out exactly what was wrong and why they did it the way they did it and how they went about creating this deception, this grand deception.
[02:40:34.484 --> 02:40:35.825]  Now let me try to break this down.
[02:40:35.845 --> 02:40:39.968]  Let me try to break this down and then tell me if I'm right in my summation, Mr. Cryer.
[02:40:42.170 --> 02:40:44.232]  Tom, let's go through this.
[02:40:45.372 --> 02:40:47.034]  You've got private fellow reserve.
[02:40:47.074 --> 02:40:48.995]  The Bank of England's taken over the United States.
[02:40:49.035 --> 02:40:50.336]  They've paid off the politicians.
[02:40:50.677 --> 02:40:52.138]  They get their private fellow reserve.
[02:40:52.158 --> 02:40:53.078]  They're in the white pages.
[02:40:53.118 --> 02:40:53.719]  That's admitted.
[02:40:54.716 --> 02:41:00.122]  We've got to have their income tax to siphon off to try to, quote, keep inflation down.
[02:41:00.182 --> 02:41:02.905]  The truth is, the tax money is just a mode of control.
[02:41:03.286 --> 02:41:04.447]  They don't even need it.
[02:41:04.527 --> 02:41:06.129]  It doesn't even run the government.
[02:41:06.469 --> 02:41:11.475]  That's how the private banks get the government itself into debt, and that gets all into the banking system.
[02:41:11.895 --> 02:41:14.896]  I don't know about the Bank of England, and I don't know about some of these others.
[02:41:14.936 --> 02:41:19.198]  What I still consider a misbelief is I haven't made independent verification of these things.
[02:41:19.258 --> 02:41:23.880]  Oh, I have, but I was going to move forward into the future.
[02:41:24.221 --> 02:41:40.588]  But I do know this much, Alex, that through the use of fiat money, and through the use of an illegally applied income tax, the Federal Reserve, for whatever purpose and for whoever's benefit that may be,
[02:41:41.787 --> 02:41:43.288]  Here's an analogy of what I'm trying to get to.
[02:41:43.308 --> 02:41:52.811]  There is no law in the United States that anyone has to be vaccinated, that anyone has to take shots, but they get up on the news for a month before the new school year and say, it's the law, no shots, no school, you'll go to jail.
[02:42:10.536 --> 02:42:15.159]  Now what they do is, once you go to school, they will kick you out.
[02:42:15.259 --> 02:42:18.021]  Not telling you it's federal law that they have to give you a waiver.
[02:42:18.181 --> 02:42:20.483]  A waiver to a law that doesn't even exist.
[02:42:20.863 --> 02:42:21.944]  It's a regulation.
[02:42:22.777 --> 02:42:37.648]  But then once they expel you, then they activate truancy charges to then bring in criminal penalties, but then that of course is overturned because they are expelling you for a false reason.
[02:42:37.668 --> 02:42:38.828]  Now that's what the courts have found.
[02:42:38.848 --> 02:42:41.650]  But your parallel is perfect, Alex.
[02:42:41.991 --> 02:42:51.978]  Your parallel you drew there is absolutely perfect, because when you file an income tax return, you have to, in order to assess yourself with income taxes, you have to waive
[02:42:53.081 --> 02:42:53.661]  I don't think so.
[02:43:13.816 --> 02:43:15.057]  But how many people know that?
[02:43:15.478 --> 02:43:16.759]  It's just like your freedom of speech.
[02:43:16.779 --> 02:43:18.160]  They can't tax your freedom of speech.
[02:43:18.180 --> 02:43:23.706]  They can't put a tax collector in front of the church and collect a $10 going to church tax.
[02:43:25.087 --> 02:43:29.331]  They can't tax your labor either because your labor is on your property.
[02:43:29.958 --> 02:43:31.098]  And they can't tax property.
[02:43:31.318 --> 02:43:32.519]  Well, let's just explain this, people.
[02:43:32.559 --> 02:43:34.039]  Most of our audience understands this.
[02:43:34.579 --> 02:43:36.679]  Before 1913, we didn't have this.
[02:43:36.740 --> 02:43:39.820]  The tax wasn't even on the general public until the 1950s.
[02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:44.761]  This nation grew at 12% a year or greater on average.
[02:43:44.801 --> 02:43:45.821]  Now we're at 2 or 3%.
[02:43:46.642 --> 02:43:50.583]  So this is the control of the internationalists coming in.
[02:43:50.603 --> 02:43:53.703]  Actually, the deception started back before 1954.
[02:43:53.743 --> 02:43:55.344]  1954 was when it shifted into overdrive.
[02:43:57.784 --> 02:44:03.607]  The 54 Code is whenever they switched up their terminology in order to be even more deceptive.
[02:44:04.268 --> 02:44:07.410]  But prior to that time, the deception was already in place.
[02:44:07.790 --> 02:44:09.190]  The deception started in 1916.
[02:44:11.232 --> 02:44:11.752]  Absolutely.
[02:44:11.772 --> 02:44:19.636]  Well, I mean, we got to the income tax in 1913, but I... Yeah, I know, but 1913, you know, it was a different deal.
[02:44:19.676 --> 02:44:22.958]  They didn't know what their boundaries were.
[02:44:23.078 --> 02:44:26.480]  In 1916, they did know where their boundaries were, so that's why they started to deceive.
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:27.220]  Sure.
[02:44:27.660 --> 02:44:33.303]  Now, expanding on this, Tom Cryer, the point I'm trying to make is going back to the shots.
[02:44:33.783 --> 02:44:41.387]  For cops listening who can't figure this out, for school teachers listening who can't figure this out, for doctors listening who can't figure this out, let me explain.
[02:44:42.327 --> 02:44:53.473]  There is no law, you can go verify this in five seconds, you can go look at the law books, you can look at the penal code of your state, there is no law you've got to take vaccinations.
[02:44:55.282 --> 02:45:05.609]  But they go around and tell everybody that, and we've gotten to the point now pretty much where the CPS is grabbing children, they are arresting people, when there isn't even a law.
[02:45:05.689 --> 02:45:11.173]  That's how la-la land and force du jour all of this has gotten.
[02:45:11.873 --> 02:45:12.374]  Exactly.
[02:45:12.974 --> 02:45:14.415]  And it's the same thing in the 1950s.
[02:45:14.435 --> 02:45:16.196]  You're talking about de facto laws.
[02:45:16.617 --> 02:45:16.877]  Yes.
[02:45:16.897 --> 02:45:20.119]  You put laws that are laws only because people believe that they are.
[02:45:21.985 --> 02:45:30.369]  The IRS has admitted that the collection of the income tax is entirely dependent on public's believing that they are telling the truth about the law.
[02:45:32.451 --> 02:45:37.994]  The belief, the perceived law, the law de facto that is supposed to be the law du jour.
[02:45:38.746 --> 02:45:38.966]  Yes.
[02:45:39.227 --> 02:45:43.632]  In other words, the law that people perceive rather than the law as it's actually written.
[02:45:44.513 --> 02:45:47.096]  And if you look at the way the law is written, it's very clear.
[02:45:47.116 --> 02:45:55.246]  I mean, it's not that much of mumbo-jumbo, but it is given to you in backwards and left-handed ways to create illusions.
[02:45:55.807 --> 02:45:57.389]  It was done by, it was ingenious.
[02:45:57.409 --> 02:45:58.190]  It really is.
[02:45:58.979 --> 02:46:02.322]  But it creates an illusion of a tax being there that isn't even there.
[02:46:02.362 --> 02:46:07.787]  Just like an illusion that there's a requirement that your children be subjected to vaccination whenever you choose not to.
[02:46:07.807 --> 02:46:09.028]  They're your children.
[02:46:09.048 --> 02:46:10.229]  That's your choice, not theirs.
[02:46:11.025 --> 02:46:14.487]  And you have to waive that right to make that choice for them to have that.
[02:46:14.667 --> 02:46:20.331]  And then you can fracturally go into... By force and extortion and intimidation into waiving a right.
[02:46:21.131 --> 02:46:23.172]  And that's exactly what's happening with your income tax.
[02:46:23.192 --> 02:46:24.133]  Let me expand on that.
[02:46:24.153 --> 02:46:30.557]  Your parallel is as perfect a parallel as I've ever seen in any instance of discussing this issue.
[02:46:30.757 --> 02:46:32.118]  Let me raise one more parallel here.
[02:46:32.998 --> 02:46:46.809]  Article 1 of the Bill of Rights, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or obliging the freedom of speech of the press, or the right of the people, peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
[02:46:46.869 --> 02:46:48.450]  Now, that's the First Amendment.
[02:46:48.490 --> 02:46:53.674]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:46:53.714 --> 02:47:00.980]  Now, until the 1950s, churches weren't certified of the state like they were in Russia, and Red China, and Nazi Germany.
[02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:05.043]  But then they came to the churches and said, hey, just file this form.
[02:47:05.063 --> 02:47:06.604]  Now, there was no law.
[02:47:06.984 --> 02:47:07.344]  C3.
[02:47:07.664 --> 02:47:08.505]  Yes, exactly.
[02:47:08.805 --> 02:47:09.886]  It was another trick.
[02:47:10.306 --> 02:47:14.249]  Now, if you're not registered, they'll raid your church with guys with machine guns.
[02:47:14.689 --> 02:47:16.050]  Again, no law.
[02:47:16.290 --> 02:47:23.675]  They tricked people into contract, but once the majority were operating under contract, now the brainwashed cops will go seize your church.
[02:47:24.056 --> 02:47:28.819]  This is right in the old, uh, I will respect you in the warning department.
[02:47:29.359 --> 02:47:31.721]  And I'm from the government and I'm here to help your department.
[02:47:32.782 --> 02:47:33.722]  Uh, exactly right.
[02:47:33.982 --> 02:47:35.183]  It's another perfect parallel.
[02:47:35.563 --> 02:47:40.787]  What's basically they're doing is they're sitting here saying that we're here, you know, we're trying to do the right thing.
[02:47:40.827 --> 02:47:42.048]  We're trying to do the good thing.
[02:47:42.488 --> 02:47:42.968]  And they're not.
[02:47:44.209 --> 02:47:49.593]  Uh, the 501c3 churches, you know, uh, can't be infringed upon.
[02:47:50.654 --> 02:47:55.557]  I mean, there's a very simple taxation because they are exercising.
[02:47:56.221 --> 02:47:57.783]  A God-given fundamental right.
[02:47:57.823 --> 02:48:05.774]  But they trick you in that instrument, 501c3, you think that's where you find your First Amendment, when it was already inherent, and now the contract waives your rights.
[02:48:05.994 --> 02:48:06.415]  Right.
[02:48:06.555 --> 02:48:13.204]  You are tricked into waiving your rights, just like people are tricked into waiving their exemptions through taxation.
[02:48:14.142 --> 02:48:15.903]  Uh, by filing a tax return.
[02:48:16.384 --> 02:48:17.725]  That's why... Stay there!
[02:48:17.785 --> 02:48:18.485]  Final segment!
[02:48:18.505 --> 02:48:20.266]  I want to come back, plug your website, Mr. Cryer.
[02:48:20.286 --> 02:48:22.208]  I want to get you up for a full hour in the near future.
[02:48:22.268 --> 02:48:26.271]  I want to talk about Ed and Lane Brown, your take on what's happening to them when we get back, sir.
[02:48:26.311 --> 02:48:27.492]  It's really great to have you on.
[02:48:27.512 --> 02:48:28.772]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:48:28.812 --> 02:48:30.514]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:48:30.774 --> 02:48:34.456]  Don't forget, Endgame is about to come out, and you can watch it at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:48:48.260 --> 02:48:53.706]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.067 --> 02:49:01.715]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.412 --> 02:49:09.456]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.856 --> 02:49:21.282]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.582 --> 02:49:25.164]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.525 --> 02:49:27.486]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.826 --> 02:49:31.668]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:44.694 --> 02:50:46.815]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[02:50:47.175 --> 02:50:50.236]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[02:50:50.476 --> 02:50:55.058]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[02:50:55.438 --> 02:50:58.039]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[02:50:58.539 --> 02:51:05.261]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[02:51:05.721 --> 02:51:10.965]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[02:51:11.405 --> 02:51:13.046]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[02:51:13.567 --> 02:51:16.849]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[02:51:17.429 --> 02:51:20.772]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[02:51:20.812 --> 02:51:27.797]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[02:51:28.157 --> 02:51:33.561]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and shipping.
[02:51:33.881 --> 02:51:35.282]  Share the oil company's secrets.
[02:51:35.402 --> 02:51:36.743]  And get SFR now!

[02:51:47.667 --> 02:51:48.468]  Final segment.
[02:51:49.328 --> 02:51:50.749]  About to go back to Tom Cryer.
[02:51:50.769 --> 02:51:51.429]  He's a lawyer.
[02:51:52.710 --> 02:51:53.770]  He just beat the IRS.
[02:51:53.790 --> 02:51:58.532]  We've got to get him on for a full hour and talk about how that trial went and what the feds do when they lose.
[02:51:58.552 --> 02:52:00.373]  About to go back to him here in just a moment.
[02:52:00.393 --> 02:52:02.374]  I want to tell you about an excellent green food.
[02:52:03.974 --> 02:52:04.534]  Whole food.

[02:52:30.468 --> 02:52:32.069]  Helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels.

[02:52:40.436 --> 02:52:42.497]  ENERFOOD.COM or 1-866-762-9238.
[02:52:42.517 --> 02:52:45.940]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:52:45.960 --> 02:52:50.444]  You can also call and get that 10%.
[02:52:50.484 --> 02:52:50.684]  866-762-9238.
[02:52:51.044 --> 02:52:52.105]  Going back to Tom.
[02:52:52.405 --> 02:53:00.052]  Tom, it's clear I've got to get you back up soon, but just in closing, can you in a nutshell tell us what it was like, what the feds looked like when you were found not guilty?
[02:53:01.833 --> 02:53:12.139]  Well, there were about 15 of the IRS and Department of Justice people that had come downstairs to view the beheading.
[02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:22.366]  And when the jury verdict was read, the first count, not guilty, by the time they read the second count, they were all out of the courtroom.
[02:53:23.543 --> 02:53:40.789]  I did not notice, but I was told by four or five people that the case agent who had violated a number of laws just to get me there, and that'll be a later chapter, but he skulked out of the courtroom while they were reading a second.
[02:53:41.491 --> 02:53:42.672]  Yeah, they really do.
[02:53:42.732 --> 02:53:45.074]  Like I said, I separate them into two categories.
[02:53:45.094 --> 02:53:47.837]  You have those that can't read their GED without moving their lips.
[02:54:01.047 --> 02:54:02.188]  No, I don't know.
[02:54:20.561 --> 02:54:21.162]  I don't think so.
[02:54:40.405 --> 02:54:43.488]  They didn't cross-examine me, they didn't lay a glove on me, they walked away.
[02:54:44.669 --> 02:54:47.611]  Uh, but... That's because they know... Now, now, now, now, hold on.
[02:54:47.651 --> 02:54:51.134]  Listen, listen, in closing, what do you think about the Brown situation?
[02:54:51.154 --> 02:54:54.056]  I think it's pitiful, but I am relieved that they're not hurt.
[02:54:55.077 --> 02:54:56.478]  Uh, and that nobody else got hurt.
[02:54:57.499 --> 02:55:01.182]  The people who get hurt in this aren't the jerks that are bringing all this about.
[02:55:01.442 --> 02:55:04.765]  They're the guys out there on the street who think they're enforcing the law.
[02:55:05.445 --> 02:55:06.987]  And those are the guys that get hurt.
[02:55:07.387 --> 02:55:09.789]  They, you know, the generals never go out there and get shot.
[02:55:10.940 --> 02:55:13.801]  But the guys that make war don't get shot.
[02:55:14.642 --> 02:55:16.002]  It's the guys who fight them.
[02:55:16.242 --> 02:55:20.164]  And I'm just relieved that the siege is over.
[02:55:20.344 --> 02:55:21.304]  I wish it hadn't happened.
[02:55:21.684 --> 02:55:23.985]  I tried to offer to help.
[02:55:24.005 --> 02:55:31.028]  But once it all comes down, I know Larry had offered to help before the trial.
[02:55:31.948 --> 02:55:36.630]  But you know, Lord knows they wanted to do it their way and they did.
[02:55:37.390 --> 02:55:38.711]  And now they're martyrs.
[02:55:40.189 --> 02:55:45.474]  But still, there are some possibilities that are being kicked around for trying to get some relief to them.
[02:55:46.074 --> 02:55:47.315]  They didn't get a fair trial.
[02:55:47.716 --> 02:55:50.538]  Now, whose fault that was could be argued, but they didn't get a fair trial.
[02:55:50.818 --> 02:55:54.762]  Tom, I'm going to get you back on, if not this week, next week, to talk about this.
[02:55:55.402 --> 02:55:58.225]  And congratulations on your victory for liberty and freedom.
[02:55:58.245 --> 02:55:58.765]  God bless you.
[02:55:58.785 --> 02:55:59.346]  Thank you, sir.
[02:55:59.426 --> 02:56:00.927]  And thank you for having me on, Alex.
[02:56:01.047 --> 02:56:01.347]  You bet.
[02:56:01.628 --> 02:56:03.109]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
