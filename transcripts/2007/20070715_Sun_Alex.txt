[00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:16.190]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.151]  He stands for what's right.

[00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.332]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.452 --> 00:00:40.413]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:41.474]  It is July 15, 2007.
[00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:44.155]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:50.967]  The toll free number to join us is 877-590-5525.
[00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:52.368]  877-590-KLBJ.
[00:00:52.808 --> 00:00:58.972]  That's the namesake station we are coming to you live from.
[00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:02.034]  Syndicated across the nation on AM and FM dial.
[00:01:02.534 --> 00:01:04.495]  Satellite, shortwave, and of course the internet.
[00:01:05.376 --> 00:01:06.737]  Badinfoawards.com.
[00:01:07.257 --> 00:01:08.998]  And prisonplanet.com.
[00:01:09.478 --> 00:01:12.800]  The local number here in Central Texas is 836-0590.
[00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:16.603]  And I'm going to attempt to take a lot of your phone calls on a host of issues today.
[00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:20.562]  Friday, we heard the announcement.
[00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:24.384]  There was a new Bin Laden tape Friday evening, late Friday evening.
[00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:28.347]  A new Bin Laden tape, Bin Laden had popped up in a videotape.
[00:01:28.987 --> 00:01:34.550]  And as soon as I saw the short clip, I said, well that's pre-2001 Bin Laden.
[00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.271]  I'd seen the video hundreds of times.
[00:01:37.052 --> 00:01:41.234]  And we put out on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com that it would be an old videotape.
[00:01:42.495 --> 00:01:45.517]  Now, that isn't a very hard prediction to make.
[00:01:46.665 --> 00:02:16.220]  The reason that's not a hard prediction to make is more than ten times in the last five and a half years since 9-11, now more than five and a half years, there are always, that is the military-industrial complex, trying to boogeyman us with Bin Laden videos that are always old and it turns out that government intelligence agencies or private groups associated with intelligence agencies upload these as re-edits to fearmonger the public.
[00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:26.025]  And indeed, it came out as of Saturday morning that it was an old videotape from 2000, pre-9-11.
[00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:29.108]  Drudge kept it up, though, until just a few minutes ago.
[00:02:29.308 --> 00:02:30.369]  He's known that for a day and a half.
[00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:32.510]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:39.175]  Take it down with no mention of it being a staged event.
[00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:42.192]  And it's not just that.
[00:02:42.252 --> 00:02:54.700]  Of course this surfaced while we have the supposed number two of Al-Qaeda saying that they're behind the car attacks in England and in Scotland a few weeks ago and that they're going to strike America.
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.043]  And of course Al-Qaeda only comes out in unison with the Defense Department.
[00:02:59.163 --> 00:03:03.626]  They always come out in unison, as good little Al-CIAs that they are.
[00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:22.428]  With their own CIA file names, that's what Al-Qaeda is, is a CIA case name, set up in 79 for these individuals, that you notice that we hear that suddenly Al-Qaeda has rebuilt to pre-911 levels, they're about to strike us, the approval ratings of the Bush administration have dropped so low
[00:03:23.346 --> 00:03:31.992]  That Al-Qaeda is coming to get us so that we can then love our leaders again and jump into their laps and hug them and kiss them and beg them to keep us safe from Al-Syaida.
[00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:38.496]  I mean, do you notice how just in a two-week period, suddenly, it seems as if Hades is breaking loose?
[00:03:38.936 --> 00:03:40.177]  And we see this over and over again.
[00:03:40.217 --> 00:03:45.000]  Every time on the eve of war, Saddam Hussein is saying, I've always fought Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:47.742]  Al-Qaeda is a tool of the U.S.
[00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:50.964]  I have a secular government.
[00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.875]  And I don't have WMDs.
[00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:56.076]  Don't attack me.
[00:03:56.796 --> 00:04:00.079]  And then suddenly, number two of Al Qaeda comes out and says, that's not true.
[00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:01.981]  We work with Saddam.
[00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:03.382]  And the news heralds it.
[00:04:03.522 --> 00:04:05.323]  Look, Saddam is Al Qaeda.
[00:04:06.404 --> 00:04:09.887]  I mean, how dumb do you think we are?
[00:04:09.947 --> 00:04:18.575]  Well, I mean, I guess we must be pretty stupid on average, because they, I mean, it's just the amazing levels of propaganda that we've seen.
[00:04:18.595 --> 00:04:19.816]  Remember whenever
[00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:39.809]  Colin Powell, just a few weeks before they attacked Iraq in March of 2003, now over four years ago, and he got up on television before the Senate and he said, why, it's on Al Jazeera right now, a new Bin Laden tape, saying that he works with Saddam.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.963]  And literally the reporters, hundreds of them in the back, ran out and came back 30 minutes later.
[00:04:45.283 --> 00:04:51.747]  Some of the staffers talked to the chairman of the committee and they said, there's Al Jazeera saying there's not a new bin Laden tape.
[00:04:51.787 --> 00:04:53.848]  And where did you get this information?
[00:04:53.888 --> 00:04:58.010]  And Powell literally, I have this on video, said, it'll be out later this afternoon.
[00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:04.294]  They can't even coordinate their staging of this stuff correctly.
[00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.812]  And then the fat Bin Laden taking credit for 9-11.
[00:05:09.153 --> 00:05:11.575]  Some guy suddenly gained literally 150 pounds.
[00:05:11.635 --> 00:05:13.156]  His nose has gotten an inch longer.
[00:05:13.516 --> 00:05:19.661]  They had experts in the US, England, and France as well, as well as Canada, do voice prints.
[00:05:21.282 --> 00:05:27.027]  They could take the real voice of Bin Laden, create a voice print that would open doors or access phone accounts.
[00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:27.908]  That's a science.
[00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:31.791]  And then they could take the new voice of the fat Bin Laden
[00:05:33.016 --> 00:05:34.317]  And it wouldn't open doors.
[00:05:34.697 --> 00:05:36.017]  It wouldn't pass voice key.
[00:05:36.257 --> 00:05:37.238]  In fact, it wasn't even close.
[00:05:37.278 --> 00:05:41.939]  Then linguists listened to it, and they said, My God, this isn't even somebody from Saudi Arabia!
[00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:51.663]  This dialect matches closely an Arab who has lived in the United States most of their life, probably East Coast.
[00:05:51.683 --> 00:05:54.584]  So you've got a fat East Coast Arab,
[00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:01.807]  Up there saying, I care about 9-11, I'm going to get you, and the CIA blurs the video.
[00:06:02.408 --> 00:06:08.557]  I mean, they treat you like you're fools, but let's just say Al-Qaeda's real, they're going to get us, we're in big trouble.
[00:06:09.541 --> 00:06:27.045]  The Jerusalem Post a month ago reported, what we already knew, that Idi Amin worked for Mossad and staged the event at the airport in the late 1970s as a way to demonize the Palestinian movement that was trying to be mainstream and non-violent at that time.
[00:06:27.465 --> 00:06:31.566]  And now these Israeli documents and British documents are declassified, and we already of course knew that.
[00:06:32.747 --> 00:06:36.489]  Because most of these events are staged by the British, by the Israelis, or by the U.S.
[00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:37.510]  The Russians also do it.
[00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.973]  Are there real Arabs that run around pulling ripcords and detonating plastic explosives?
[00:06:42.053 --> 00:06:42.534]  Absolutely.
[00:06:43.014 --> 00:06:45.576]  Are there real terrorists that will fire rocket-propelled grenades at our troops?
[00:06:45.996 --> 00:06:46.516]  Absolutely.
[00:06:47.117 --> 00:06:49.719]  Will a woman go on a bus and stab 14 people?
[00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:50.619]  Absolutely.
[00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:54.182]  Is there real physical resistance that's called terrorism going on?
[00:06:54.242 --> 00:06:54.542]  Yes!
[00:06:55.403 --> 00:06:56.283]  Yes, there is.
[00:06:56.784 --> 00:07:01.387]  But my point is the big spectaculars, the big spectaculars,
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.001]  Are government-sponsored, or that is, elements of criminal government-sponsored.
[00:07:07.061 --> 00:07:15.203]  So, as if a light switch has been thrown, suddenly, they are coming out of the woodwork.
[00:07:16.323 --> 00:07:20.504]  Right on cue with Chertoff saying, I'm feeling it in my belly, Al-Qaeda's about to strike.
[00:07:20.564 --> 00:07:22.085]  And then, oh, a report just came out!
[00:07:22.785 --> 00:07:26.886]  Oh my gosh, a classified report that the FBI leaked on accident, of course.
[00:07:27.086 --> 00:07:28.066]  Quote, accident.
[00:07:29.478 --> 00:07:43.936]  No, we're not supposed to see it, so we'll take it more serious, because big Republican memos have come out, the first one two years ago, saying they're not buying into the staged terror anymore, we need really big terror events, or our whole new war agenda is going to stall.
[00:07:44.651 --> 00:07:46.412]  And Democrat think tanks have said the same thing.
[00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:47.233]  They all love it, too.
[00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:51.836]  Big government needs this, so you think that they need them.
[00:07:52.217 --> 00:07:59.462]  And so they can set up a police state right at the point that they're tanking the dollar, and tanking the housing market, and bringing us deeply into the New World Order.
[00:07:59.992 --> 00:08:04.756]  They have to have a police state in place for you so they can take your bank accounts and pension funds.
[00:08:05.177 --> 00:08:10.601]  Now, if you wake up to the New World Order and say, wait a minute, you're behind all this, they'll probably leave the dollar alone.
[00:08:11.062 --> 00:08:13.604]  They'll probably let us keep living our lives.
[00:08:13.684 --> 00:08:16.407]  I know you want to be complacent and only care about yourselves, a lot of you.
[00:08:16.687 --> 00:08:17.127]  Okay!
[00:08:17.428 --> 00:08:18.869]  I have to care about myself, too!
[00:08:19.109 --> 00:08:20.130]  That's why I'm doing this!
[00:08:20.678 --> 00:08:26.742]  And I'm telling you, if you speak up and get involved, you may still be able to go out on bass boats and go to the topless bar.
[00:08:27.082 --> 00:08:31.525]  And you may still be able to act cool with your buddies and get a big Harley and get a devil tattoo.
[00:08:32.286 --> 00:08:38.390]  But the American way of life is ending very, very quickly if we don't turn this around.
[00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:40.031]  And that's the bottom line.
[00:08:40.051 --> 00:08:43.153]  We've got some news on what's happening with the economy coming up later as well.
[00:08:43.193 --> 00:08:50.298]  But here's a piece of evidence that any of you that care... I mean, this is a challenge to those of you out there that listen who are in denial.
[00:08:51.485 --> 00:09:11.275]  Any of you that care, or any of you that care but think I'm making this stuff up, you can learn today, with a major search engine, off of even the CIA's own fact book, you know, believe them, don't believe me, you're precious, that Sunnis and Shiites are two different major sects of Islam.
[00:09:12.335 --> 00:09:12.775]  Okay?
[00:09:13.576 --> 00:09:20.079]  One believes that to be a big imam, a religious leader, you've got to have a genetic lineage to the Prophet Muhammad.
[00:09:20.703 --> 00:09:21.924]  The other doesn't believe that.
[00:09:23.105 --> 00:09:23.485]  Okay?
[00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:25.547]  Iran is Shiite.
[00:09:26.047 --> 00:09:28.489]  Saudi Arabia is Wahhabi.
[00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.590]  Okay?
[00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:33.613]  And I don't know how to explain this to you any simpler.
[00:09:33.633 --> 00:09:34.774]  When we get back, I'll explain it.
[00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:40.839]  Because it's now, we broke this months ago here, it's now mainstream news, U.S.
[00:09:41.019 --> 00:09:45.803]  uses Al-Qaeda, that's even mainstream headlines now, to attack Iran.
[00:09:45.843 --> 00:09:48.125]  Now, how is Al-Qaeda about to get us?
[00:09:48.165 --> 00:09:49.906]  But they always pop up right when we need them.
[00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:57.963]  To push the police state, or to back up the Bush administration, that they're about to attack Iran, and are attacking Iran.
[00:09:58.123 --> 00:09:58.684]  We'll be right back.
[00:09:59.244 --> 00:10:06.989]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:10:07.369 --> 00:10:09.290]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:17.295]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:25.060]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:28.344]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:10:28.785 --> 00:10:31.107]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:10:31.508 --> 00:10:32.349]  NSA spying.
[00:10:32.822 --> 00:10:36.863]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:10:37.163 --> 00:10:41.084]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:10:41.144 --> 00:10:42.844]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:10:43.384 --> 00:10:47.325]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:11:02.538 --> 00:11:07.240]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:12.083]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:11:12.283 --> 00:11:15.024]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:11:15.064 --> 00:11:16.185]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:11:17.526 --> 00:11:22.128]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:11:23.048 --> 00:11:30.252]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:11:31.352 --> 00:11:31.572]  Yes.
[00:12:01.385 --> 00:12:04.006]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:12:04.386 --> 00:12:09.388]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:11.489]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:12:11.789 --> 00:12:16.391]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:12:16.771 --> 00:12:17.752]  How much do you want?
[00:12:17.972 --> 00:12:18.713]  When do you want it?
[00:12:19.093 --> 00:12:20.675]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:12:20.975 --> 00:12:21.816]  When will you need it?
[00:12:22.056 --> 00:12:24.118]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:12:24.258 --> 00:12:25.359]  Will there be any food?
[00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:26.920]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:32.185]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:12:32.385 --> 00:12:35.588]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:12:35.968 --> 00:12:39.431]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:12:39.771 --> 00:12:40.772]  How much will you need?
[00:12:40.992 --> 00:12:41.613]  We don't know.
[00:12:41.893 --> 00:12:42.814]  How much do you want?
[00:12:42.994 --> 00:12:43.754]  All you can get.
[00:12:43.934 --> 00:12:44.795]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:12:45.035 --> 00:12:47.798]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:12:48.098 --> 00:12:49.839]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:12:49.859 --> 00:12:50.780]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.123]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[00:13:05.383 --> 00:13:09.246]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[00:13:09.607 --> 00:13:14.631]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[00:13:14.911 --> 00:13:26.120]  Electrolyzed Plus Water will alkalinize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens, become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.762]  Electrolyzed water is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and environmentally safe for humans and animals.
[00:13:31.022 --> 00:13:40.345]  Alkaline water is available as a concentrate to be mixed with good, filtered, purified RO water, but non-tap water, micro-structured alkaline antioxidant water for consumption.

[00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.730]  That's N-U-T-R-I with an I, Medical.com.
[00:14:03.891 --> 00:14:06.272]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[00:14:06.352 --> 00:14:07.592]  Well, search no more.
[00:14:07.652 --> 00:14:09.892]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:14.953]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[00:14:15.754 --> 00:14:17.914]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:19.855 --> 00:14:21.356]  Alright, your phone calls are coming up.
[00:14:21.376 --> 00:14:25.537]  I also want to give you a little preview of some of the news coming up later in the shower and the next.
[00:14:29.359 --> 00:14:46.305]  Now, over three years ago, when the invasion first began, we immediately noticed that it was coming out in some of the Arab press and the Central Asian press that terror attacks were starting all over Iran.
[00:14:48.403 --> 00:14:56.114]  And then sure enough, the Bush administration released some documents and admitted that they were trying to fund the overthrow of Iran.
[00:14:56.655 --> 00:15:03.725]  Then we looked at the names of the four groups they were funding, and I mean, one of the groups had the, at the time, number three of Al-Qaeda running.
[00:15:04.594 --> 00:15:09.859]  And they were in bases all over eastern Iraq on the western border with Iran.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:15.865]  And then Sy Hersh reported that there were ongoing attacks in Iran being carried out.
[00:15:15.906 --> 00:15:21.271]  I mean, police stations being attacked, military being attacked, civilians being attacked.
[00:15:22.222 --> 00:15:27.283]  And this is real live terror going on all over the western area of Iran.
[00:15:27.823 --> 00:15:38.246]  And then the US Special Forces about two years ago have been in there full-time leading these Wahhabi Sunni groups, Al-Qaeda groups.
[00:15:39.026 --> 00:15:44.387]  And then the number two in Al-Qaeda, about a week and a half ago, remember he came out and he said, we are going to attack Iran!
[00:15:44.487 --> 00:15:45.447]  Full-scale war!
[00:15:46.108 --> 00:15:47.268]  And he's operating out of
[00:15:48.237 --> 00:15:49.657]  Out of Eastern Iraq with U.S.
[00:15:49.737 --> 00:15:50.858]  and coalition protection.
[00:15:51.298 --> 00:15:53.419]  And I mean, it's all in the newspapers.
[00:15:54.139 --> 00:15:56.419]  Now it's not us telling you about it three plus years ago.
[00:15:56.439 --> 00:15:57.740]  Now it's in the newspapers.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:04.482]  And a major assault was launched just a few months ago, and we put out the headline on PrisonPlanet.com that, you know, Al-Qaeda under U.S.
[00:16:04.522 --> 00:16:07.043]  control steps up offensive against Iran.
[00:16:07.443 --> 00:16:10.084]  We got a few emails from people going, oh, that's not true, I don't believe you.
[00:16:10.304 --> 00:16:13.645]  I mean, it's in the newspaper.
[00:16:13.705 --> 00:16:14.985]  But it doesn't stop there.
[00:16:17.128 --> 00:16:18.989]  It doesn't stop there being hidden in plain view.
[00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:21.130]  And this is what's so mind-boggling.
[00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:26.873]  Then I'll read in headlines, Iran behind Al-Qaeda in Iraq and attacks on U.S.
[00:16:26.933 --> 00:16:27.433]  forces.
[00:16:28.334 --> 00:16:30.174]  Hundreds of articles every few months.
[00:16:30.214 --> 00:16:31.815]  I mean, no kidding.
[00:16:31.835 --> 00:16:32.355]  I don't know how many.
[00:16:32.395 --> 00:16:32.856]  Thousands!
[00:16:33.096 --> 00:16:34.396]  I probably see 20, 30 a day.
[00:16:34.697 --> 00:16:36.457]  You hear them all over talk radio, all over the news.
[00:16:36.818 --> 00:16:41.340]  Well, Iran's funding Al-Qaeda in Iraq, stepping up attacks on us.
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.440]  And I'm like, wait a minute!
[00:16:43.721 --> 00:16:45.622]  The Pentagon admits it's funding
[00:16:46.887 --> 00:16:52.371]  Sunni, hardcore Wahhabis, the very sect of Bin Laden, with Saudi Arabian funding.
[00:16:52.591 --> 00:16:54.912]  Saudi Arabia and Iran are always having fights with each other.
[00:16:54.932 --> 00:16:58.214]  You know, the two religious states fighting with each other.
[00:16:58.354 --> 00:17:02.717]  Iraq was secular, got blamed for being with Al-Qaeda when their history was they fought them.
[00:17:03.598 --> 00:17:04.759]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:17:05.019 --> 00:17:06.500]  And let me just put it in layman's terms.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:11.883]  Al-Qaeda openly works for the private banks that own our military industrial complex.
[00:17:12.123 --> 00:17:13.284]  It's not even our military anymore.
[00:17:13.757 --> 00:17:23.721]  They openly run it, and they're using them, Al-Qaeda, to attack Iran, and Iran is wisely, literally laying there and taking it, because it's all a war provocation, like Goldman Sachs.
[00:17:25.522 --> 00:17:37.247]  Iran's laying there taking it, and then not only does our government fund them to attack, Al-Qaeda to attack Iran, then our media says Iran is led by Al-Qaeda and is funding Al-Qaeda.
[00:17:40.692 --> 00:18:05.372]  I mean that would be like if the cops publicly in uniform at high noon announced for six months they were going to rob a bank in downtown Manhattan and they robbed it and publicly announced their names and then got in armored cars and drove away with the money and then they went and arrested some innocent shopkeeper saying they stole the money when publicly the shopkeeper had nothing to do with it.
[00:18:06.577 --> 00:18:10.258]  A shopkeeper in Timbuktu, you know, in Oregon.
[00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:13.879]  I mean, it's so... They think you're so stupid.
[00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:17.279]  They treat you like you're complete and total idiots.
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:27.241]  I mean, I've read... I don't know, more than 15 books about the history of Al Qaeda.
[00:18:27.801 --> 00:18:28.902]  By the way, books before 9-11.
[00:18:29.562 --> 00:18:35.403]  I mean, books written by former National Security Advisors and Presidents and Prime Ministers and CIA Chiefs.
[00:18:36.266 --> 00:18:41.948]  How wonderful Al-Qaeda is, how good Al-Qaeda is, how Al-Qaeda is so wonderful, how the U.S.
[00:18:41.988 --> 00:18:47.590]  government created it in 1979, Al-Qaeda calls themselves Mujahideen, Global Mujahideen.
[00:18:48.891 --> 00:18:56.733]  Al-Qaeda just means base of operations, a crude translation, in the real Wahhabist it means toilet, so that's certainly not their name, it means outhouse.
[00:18:57.834 --> 00:19:03.916]  And that it's Zbigniew Brzezinski's codename for the CIA Wahhabist Muslims worldwide.
[00:19:05.555 --> 00:19:07.817]  Who, by the way, a lot of times the high-ups are CIA.
[00:19:08.378 --> 00:19:15.004]  You know, they're living in posh homes and got billion-dollar bank accounts, but then the low-level guys out there carrying out the stuff, they actually believe they're doing it for Allah.
[00:19:15.725 --> 00:19:17.066]  I mean, it's sophisticated.
[00:19:17.266 --> 00:19:24.453]  The CIA has trouble with Manchurian candidates from the West, but they find willing Manchurian candidates from the Muslim population.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.501]  You see, it's perfect for the New World Order.
[00:19:26.721 --> 00:19:47.271]  They're tailor-made culturally to be under cultural mind control and be handled through different surrogate fencing organizations, different membranes, so they don't even know that while they're carrying out terror attacks, their money comes directly from MI6, directly from Shin Bet, directly from CIA, Defense Intelligence.
[00:19:47.691 --> 00:19:49.112]  Oh, by the way, that's Jerusalem Post.
[00:19:49.152 --> 00:19:49.692]  That's not me.
[00:19:52.054 --> 00:19:53.474]  That's Jerusalem Post.
[00:19:53.494 --> 00:19:54.775]  That's Times of London.
[00:19:55.359 --> 00:19:57.000]  That's Associated Press now.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.962]  That the situation went 1978 with Idi Amin at that airport.
[00:20:03.862 --> 00:20:15.467]  And I keep talking about this because there's like, I've never counted them up, I ought to do that, like several hundred cases where the governments have declassified that they staged terror.
[00:20:16.027 --> 00:20:24.871]  Our government, and again it's not our government anymore, I'm even caught in that trap of calling it our government, admits that they carried out over a hundred bombings
[00:20:26.497 --> 00:20:27.218]  In Gladio.
[00:20:28.458 --> 00:20:29.559]  And in the NATO option.
[00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:31.160]  And the Salvador option.
[00:20:32.721 --> 00:20:34.982]  From the 1950s until 1981.
[00:20:35.242 --> 00:20:43.407]  Now finally the security service in Italy just said, that's it, blew the whistle, came out all the Italian papers, they had to shut it down at that time.
[00:20:44.105 --> 00:20:46.386]  But that was their excuse to secretly arrest people, torture them.
[00:20:46.726 --> 00:20:48.446]  And again, I don't like the communist folks.
[00:20:48.486 --> 00:20:49.546]  They play this trick too.
[00:20:49.647 --> 00:20:52.467]  That's how they got our military and our army mainly was doing it.
[00:20:52.787 --> 00:20:58.869]  To do it was they'd say, well, the communists are staging bombings and blaming it on us, so we need to stage bombings and blame it on them.
[00:20:59.949 --> 00:21:01.110]  And so both sides were doing it.
[00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.590]  But the point is, this is how this started.
[00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:09.192]  And in Bologna, it finally made some local Italian police really mad, because they killed a trainload mainly full of little kids.
[00:21:09.232 --> 00:21:10.792]  And they killed over 100 people.
[00:21:10.832 --> 00:21:12.253]  You can look up Bologna bombing, 1980.
[00:21:12.293 --> 00:21:12.613]  Bologna, Italy.
[00:21:14.403 --> 00:21:15.244]  And that's all come out.
[00:21:15.264 --> 00:21:19.446]  It's been all over national TV, their CIA director, their intelligence director.
[00:21:19.526 --> 00:21:21.127]  It's public knowledge in Italy.
[00:21:21.648 --> 00:21:23.429]  That was just one bombing of over a hundred.
[00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:32.494]  I mean, hardcore bombings in Germany, and in Spain, and in Italy, and in Austria.
[00:21:32.534 --> 00:21:39.859]  Why do you think Bill Clinton pardoned the FALN, who carried out 133 bombings in the 1970s in the U.S.?
[00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:43.321]  Why do you think Bill Clinton pardoned them when he left office?
[00:21:45.674 --> 00:21:47.294]  Because he had a lot of dirt on him, that's why, folks.
[00:21:48.575 --> 00:21:57.237]  Because he was part of those organizations back in... He had major ties to those organizations back when he was getting sheet-dipped into the CIA as a Rhodes Scholar.
[00:21:58.757 --> 00:22:00.818]  So, this is why I'm frustrated.
[00:22:00.838 --> 00:22:04.719]  I mean, I'm watching Al-Qaeda work for the criminals that run our government.
[00:22:05.819 --> 00:22:07.399]  We have the historical fact that they do.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:14.121]  And we know they're attacking Iran just as they attacked Serbia in the late 1990s.
[00:22:16.371 --> 00:22:17.952]  The attack began on Serbia.
[00:22:18.833 --> 00:22:19.873]  Serbia defended itself.
[00:22:20.434 --> 00:22:22.435]  Again, the CIA knows who to hit.
[00:22:24.436 --> 00:22:25.337]  They hit school buses.
[00:22:25.397 --> 00:22:26.097]  They hit schools.
[00:22:26.117 --> 00:22:27.018]  They hit police stations.
[00:22:27.278 --> 00:22:28.619]  The Serbs went nuts, went down there.
[00:22:28.999 --> 00:22:30.200]  Oh, we've got mass murder going on.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.480]  We've got to invade and take over.
[00:22:32.481 --> 00:22:33.942]  And they let the Muslims have Kosovo.
[00:22:34.642 --> 00:22:35.403]  Led by Al-Qaeda.
[00:22:36.423 --> 00:22:37.504]  See, you can't make this stuff up.
[00:22:37.524 --> 00:22:38.905]  That's a Senate report in 1999.
[00:22:39.165 --> 00:22:40.506]  Alfonso D'Amato's report committee.
[00:22:40.846 --> 00:22:41.486]  We'll be right back.
[00:22:41.506 --> 00:22:44.909]  We'll take some of your calls, get into Ron Paul on the economy, and a lot more.
[00:22:44.929 --> 00:22:45.369]  Stay with us.
[00:23:00.626 --> 00:23:03.647]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:23:03.948 --> 00:23:08.870]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:13.472]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:23:13.772 --> 00:23:22.696]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:23:22.896 --> 00:23:26.498]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:23:26.798 --> 00:23:31.824]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:23:32.124 --> 00:23:38.811]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:23:39.341 --> 00:23:40.002]  What about you?
[00:23:40.642 --> 00:23:46.007]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:23:47.228 --> 00:23:49.109]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:05.714]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming and the end of the world?
[00:24:06.035 --> 00:24:07.917]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[00:24:08.117 --> 00:24:11.160]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.484]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:24:14.784 --> 00:24:16.646]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[00:24:16.906 --> 00:24:20.607]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:24:20.887 --> 00:24:23.548]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[00:24:24.168 --> 00:24:28.430]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:32.951]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:24:33.352 --> 00:24:37.693]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, packet B, the unholy alliance.
[00:24:37.993 --> 00:24:38.253]  We're good.
[00:25:01.007 --> 00:25:03.488]  Do you know that you can go solar for under 1200 bucks now?
[00:25:03.508 --> 00:25:05.169]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[00:25:05.349 --> 00:25:09.532]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:25:10.112 --> 00:25:14.995]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[00:25:15.515 --> 00:25:21.939]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[00:25:22.677 --> 00:25:25.379]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[00:25:25.539 --> 00:25:35.505]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[00:25:35.785 --> 00:25:39.487]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[00:25:39.547 --> 00:25:41.488]  You know, power companies, government.
[00:25:42.348 --> 00:25:46.031]  Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:47.251]  Are you ready to go solar?
[00:25:47.451 --> 00:25:48.412]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.
[00:25:52.334 --> 00:25:56.360]  Or order them on the website at a 10% discount on KenSolar.com.

[00:25:59.784 --> 00:26:02.467]  Are you lacking energy on a daily basis?
[00:26:02.868 --> 00:26:04.650]  Do you feel tired all
[00:26:07.318 --> 00:26:08.578]  Let's do it!
[00:26:36.668 --> 00:26:37.949]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:27:06.823 --> 00:27:07.763]  Alright, welcome back.
[00:27:07.823 --> 00:27:09.904]  We're going to take some phone calls at 877-590-5525 or 836-059 including your locally.
[00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:32.771]  And then I'm going to get into more on the staged terror.
[00:27:32.971 --> 00:27:35.613]  And is there about to be a big terror attack in this country?
[00:27:36.333 --> 00:27:46.037]  Or, as Ari Fleischer, the White House Press Secretary, three years ago admitted, that they're issuing fake terror alerts for political purposes.
[00:27:47.358 --> 00:27:52.880]  And by that, is the military industrial complex going to stage another terror attack?
[00:27:53.744 --> 00:27:55.905]  Or are they just bluffing like they normally do?
[00:27:56.245 --> 00:27:58.366]  This is the biggest hyping I've seen in years.
[00:27:58.426 --> 00:28:06.289]  And, you know, how is it they promise that they destroyed Al-Qaeda and killed thousands of their leaders and all these captains after generals, after majors?
[00:28:07.209 --> 00:28:09.871]  You know, the number two guy they killed hundreds of times.
[00:28:09.891 --> 00:28:11.251]  Well, they're just always killing everyone.
[00:28:11.651 --> 00:28:14.472]  And there's constant New Daring rage, and they've invaded two countries.
[00:28:14.833 --> 00:28:16.513]  Oh, now they're on Iran.
[00:28:16.533 --> 00:28:18.034]  Now Al-Qaeda's in Iran.
[00:28:18.054 --> 00:28:18.794]  We've got to go in.
[00:28:18.974 --> 00:28:20.015]  They're saying that every day.
[00:28:20.435 --> 00:28:23.356]  Meanwhile, real Al-Qaeda is attacking Iran publicly.
[00:28:24.267 --> 00:28:24.767]  Under U.S.
[00:28:24.807 --> 00:28:25.167]  control.
[00:28:25.387 --> 00:28:27.728]  I mean, it is absolutely incredible.
[00:28:27.968 --> 00:28:29.688]  And the very globalists that run the U.S.
[00:28:29.949 --> 00:28:36.650]  are devaluing our dollar, setting up a police state, destroying our Bill of Rights and Constitution that is the heart of this constitutional republic.
[00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:40.111]  So, it's just incredible to see all of this happening.
[00:28:41.652 --> 00:28:46.893]  It's just, the North American Union, the very crew that funds Al Qaeda, that stages the terror attacks,
[00:28:47.523 --> 00:28:49.545]  As the very crew destroying our national sovereignty.
[00:28:49.805 --> 00:28:52.127]  And when George Bush leaves office, folks, that isn't going to save you.
[00:28:52.468 --> 00:29:01.656]  You know, they've got this big Democratic congressman coming out from Michigan and saying that George Bush is a new Hitler and could have staged 9-11.
[00:29:02.777 --> 00:29:04.279]  And I've got some comments on that later.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.523]  The problem here is the system is Hitler-like.
[00:29:08.583 --> 00:29:10.645]  The New World Order is Hitler-like.
[00:29:10.685 --> 00:29:11.786]  George Bush is a puppet.
[00:29:12.865 --> 00:29:17.927]  Okay, you see, the Democrats will have you believe that, oh, as soon as George Bush is gone, we're all going to be just fine.
[00:29:18.767 --> 00:29:24.889]  No, in the next hour, I'm going to spend some time reading some more New World Order quotes about the political parties and about who actually runs things.
[00:29:24.949 --> 00:29:27.170]  They own both parties, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:30.931]  And people are finally figuring that out, but will it be too late is the question.
[00:29:32.132 --> 00:29:35.153]  We've got quite a few callers here, but I'm going to go to somebody who disagrees first.
[00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:38.374]  Mark in Austin, it just says here that he disagrees.
[00:29:38.394 --> 00:29:39.374]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:29:39.434 --> 00:29:41.855]  I guess you're listening to NewsRadio 590, KLBJ.
[00:29:41.875 --> 00:29:42.155]  Welcome.
[00:29:42.891 --> 00:29:43.913]  Well, thanks Alex.
[00:29:44.333 --> 00:29:46.436]  I've listened to you for 10 years, just out of the gate.
[00:29:48.658 --> 00:29:55.947]  Is it possible that the New World Order, and what sparked me, my call is in two parts, I'll be as quick as I can.
[00:29:56.949 --> 00:30:02.015]  I showed you the other day, you've linked all the scientists with the eugenicists.
[00:30:03.012 --> 00:30:05.674]  How they want to downsize human population in a vast way.
[00:30:06.774 --> 00:30:11.917]  You know, The Last King of Scotland, while we were watching it a couple weeks ago, my wife said, I wonder if he had syphilis.
[00:30:12.258 --> 00:30:17.701]  So she looked it up on the web and he was in the advanced stages of syphilis where the dementia form appears.
[00:30:18.801 --> 00:30:29.888]  And I'm just wondering if a lot of this motivation to destroy the lives of billions of our fellow beings emanates from that
[00:30:31.164 --> 00:30:38.206]  I understand you're saying that sick cultures back when large portions of the elite had syphilis because they imbibed in prostitutes whether it was from ancient
[00:30:56.171 --> 00:31:12.277]  Uh, you know, Russia or Japan or China or the Greeks or the Romans or, of course, the British Royals, that really sick ideas and insane policies came out of the elite, a large portion being diseased.
[00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:14.018]  I think that is a very interesting
[00:31:15.278 --> 00:31:18.300]  If there is a historical corollary between the destruction of Jerusalem
[00:31:41.681 --> 00:31:42.222]  In other words,
[00:31:56.184 --> 00:31:57.765]  to bring his people back into obedience.
[00:31:57.825 --> 00:32:03.429]  According to the churches, Jesus was bad because they say you're not supposed to criticize Caesar and the government.
[00:32:03.469 --> 00:32:08.413]  They misquote Romans 13 when all the prophets are criticizing and confronting the government.
[00:32:08.673 --> 00:32:13.196]  That's why 99% of them were boiled in oil or crucified or had their guts cut out.
[00:32:13.236 --> 00:32:18.280]  But the new churches, and it was Hitler's favorite quote, by the way, was Romans 13, was you have to submit to the government.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.263]  So these modern churches are saying Jesus is wrong.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:38.223]  Well, I personally believe, after 14 years of researching this on my own, I'm kind of like an idiot savant on this subject, that this country is being taken away for the exact same reason that God... You're saying it's the will of God.
[00:32:38.583 --> 00:32:40.243]  Listen, I don't know what you disagree with.
[00:32:41.383 --> 00:32:47.064]  Christians, and I consider myself a Christian, but not what these mainland Christians are, who've never even read a Bible.
[00:32:47.084 --> 00:32:50.605]  They think worshipping world government and Cadillacs is Christianity.
[00:32:54.218 --> 00:32:59.061]  You know, you get into theology with people, and it just gives me a headache.
[00:32:59.982 --> 00:33:11.089]  There were Christians in 1775, 1776, right through the end of the war, saying, don't fight King George, Romans 13, you're supposed to submit to corrupt government.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.961]  God put it over you.
[00:33:13.421 --> 00:33:16.363]  You know, we've got a bad lot in life because that's what God wants.
[00:33:16.803 --> 00:33:18.945]  We've got a bad lot in life because we're being judged.
[00:33:19.485 --> 00:33:23.148]  A lot of Christian denominations said, don't fight Hitler when he was coming to power.
[00:33:23.428 --> 00:33:24.849]  And don't fight him once he got power.
[00:33:25.089 --> 00:33:26.310]  And go ahead and serve in his army.
[00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:27.511]  Follow his orders.
[00:33:27.571 --> 00:33:30.753]  Because we're being cursed with Hitler because we've been bad.
[00:33:32.674 --> 00:33:35.076]  And then I've read the Bible that says the exact opposite.
[00:33:35.116 --> 00:33:37.138]  We're meant to be the salt of the earth, the light of the earth.
[00:33:37.318 --> 00:33:38.479]  We're meant to confront evil.
[00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:40.780]  Who will stand up for me against the wicked one?
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.663]  Who will stand up for the weak and the orphans and the widows?
[00:33:44.223 --> 00:33:49.327]  And the Old Testament, someone comes into your house to kill your family, rise up quickly and kill them.
[00:33:49.347 --> 00:33:53.050]  And these phony churches want you to be docile.
[00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:55.131]  They teach you, thou shalt not kill.
[00:33:55.171 --> 00:33:59.575]  Well, actually, in the Hebrew and the Greek, it is thou shalt not commit murder.
[00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:01.391]  Murder!
[00:34:01.691 --> 00:34:08.975]  If I go out here because I want somebody's car, and I hit them in the head with a club and kill them, and steal their car and go take it to a chop shop, that's murder.
[00:34:09.956 --> 00:34:15.259]  Or if I have a fit of rage at my neighbor and beat him to death, that's murder.
[00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:23.244]  If I'm being attacked by a foreign military or a foreign enemy, and I defend myself and my family and my country, that is not murder.
[00:34:23.624 --> 00:34:26.046]  So see, what you've been taught is how to be docile.
[00:34:26.286 --> 00:34:28.247]  See, the empire is one of docile slaves.
[00:34:28.914 --> 00:34:30.475]  Hitler wasn't the first one preaching Romans 13.
[00:34:30.555 --> 00:34:33.237]  It's been going on for 1,500 years.
[00:34:34.097 --> 00:34:37.559]  Corrupt governments saying, you do what we say.
[00:34:37.879 --> 00:34:41.862]  The Bible says this, and it doesn't say it anywhere in there.
[00:34:43.522 --> 00:34:45.143]  Now, I know you're not saying that about Romans 13.
[00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:49.326]  You're saying more of, well, you know, America's going to be judged.
[00:34:49.346 --> 00:34:50.446]  You can't stop this evil.
[00:34:50.827 --> 00:34:53.928]  Well, let's just take it from a theological perspective, okay?
[00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:56.390]  What about Nineveh?
[00:34:57.478 --> 00:35:00.899]  And Jonah, 100 year reprieve from destruction.
[00:35:00.979 --> 00:35:02.040]  They were destroyed 100 years later.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.780]  Okay, I mean, listen.
[00:35:05.901 --> 00:35:11.403]  Also, you ever heard of, duty is ours, consequence belongs to God, or may justice be done, may the heavens fall?
[00:35:12.763 --> 00:35:14.183]  I mean, I've literally confronted preachers.
[00:35:14.224 --> 00:35:18.705]  I've gone, hey, here's the Chicago Tribune, Dyncor Halliburton, running giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:35:19.005 --> 00:35:21.706]  Halliburton's so scared about it coming out in the news, they've actually moved to Dubai.
[00:35:23.206 --> 00:35:24.266]  I mean, that's in major papers.
[00:35:24.286 --> 00:35:27.487]  Of course, I already told you about it eight years ago, but now it's in major papers.
[00:35:28.888 --> 00:35:30.888]  That's a lot better than when I used to get death threats over it.
[00:35:30.908 --> 00:35:31.849]  At least now it's in the papers.
[00:35:31.889 --> 00:35:32.709]  I feel a little bit safer.
[00:35:32.729 --> 00:35:36.010]  I mean, this is real, folks.
[00:35:39.151 --> 00:35:45.313]  And I've talked to these mainline Christians who are just all about talking real soft and feeling real good about themselves.
[00:35:45.333 --> 00:35:46.493]  They really worship themselves.
[00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:50.512]  And how they're all little Obi-Wan Kenobis or something.
[00:35:50.612 --> 00:35:53.233]  They're all above us and floating around in a cloud.
[00:35:53.253 --> 00:35:54.714]  A bunch of New Age baloney.
[00:35:55.714 --> 00:35:59.736]  And I'll bring that up to him.
[00:35:59.756 --> 00:36:03.038]  I'll bring up others to go, that's not, that's a sign of the evil increasing.
[00:36:03.418 --> 00:36:07.840]  That's why you must chant the name Jesus over and over again.
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.301]  Hey man, not me!
[00:36:09.961 --> 00:36:11.382]  God helps those that help themselves.
[00:36:11.402 --> 00:36:14.183]  The old Bedouin saying, trust in God but tie up your camel or
[00:36:14.994 --> 00:36:21.137]  There was another saying, an American writer, who was it that said, trust in God, but roll away from the rocks?
[00:36:22.818 --> 00:36:23.959]  I mean, I do trust in God.
[00:36:24.379 --> 00:36:26.280]  And you know what God tells me to do in my spirit?
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:27.120]  Fight evil.
[00:36:27.581 --> 00:36:28.181]  Tell the truth.
[00:36:28.481 --> 00:36:29.001]  Be bold.
[00:36:29.342 --> 00:36:30.182]  Stand up for the weak.
[00:36:30.602 --> 00:36:32.903]  Stand up against unjust evil wars.
[00:36:33.664 --> 00:36:36.445]  Now, when we come back, I'm going to continue with your calls.
[00:36:36.926 --> 00:36:39.387]  Mike and Arthur and many others, stay with us.
[00:36:46.493 --> 00:36:47.294]  I don't think so.
[00:37:01.192 --> 00:37:01.612]  Attention!
[00:37:01.732 --> 00:37:04.533]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[00:37:04.833 --> 00:37:09.134]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:37:09.454 --> 00:37:10.134]  Listen closely.
[00:37:10.154 --> 00:37:18.237]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[00:37:18.537 --> 00:37:27.319]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[00:37:27.639 --> 00:37:30.520]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country,
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.122]  No health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[00:37:33.422 --> 00:37:42.889]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[00:37:43.089 --> 00:37:48.713]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[00:37:48.914 --> 00:37:52.476]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[00:37:52.716 --> 00:37:56.039]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[00:38:02.145 --> 00:38:03.927]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[00:38:04.227 --> 00:38:07.069]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:09.772]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[00:38:10.412 --> 00:38:18.699]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[00:38:19.179 --> 00:38:19.740]  An example?
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:23.103]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[00:38:23.983 --> 00:38:26.746]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[00:38:27.126 --> 00:38:30.389]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[00:38:31.147 --> 00:38:36.352]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[00:38:36.972 --> 00:38:38.454]  Money is not the problem.
[00:38:38.674 --> 00:38:39.675]  Availability is.
[00:38:40.195 --> 00:38:42.057]  Be careful when food supplies get short.
[00:38:42.297 --> 00:38:45.981]  With no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[00:38:46.601 --> 00:38:48.683]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633.
[00:38:48.743 --> 00:38:49.764]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:38:49.784 --> 00:38:49.824]  800-409-5633.
[00:39:01.092 --> 00:39:06.315]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:39:06.475 --> 00:39:14.558]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:39:14.818 --> 00:39:23.322]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[00:39:23.422 --> 00:39:23.882]  Potassium
[00:39:23.882 --> 00:39:29.304]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:39:29.484 --> 00:39:34.566]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:39:34.686 --> 00:39:43.548]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:48.590]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium
[00:39:51.351 --> 00:40:04.315]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.
[00:40:04.475 --> 00:40:07.236]  We are now offering a critically important $10 package.
[00:40:07.396 --> 00:40:19.960]  The package contains 3 DVDs with 10 different programs, our new 658-page book called The Truth About What Really Happened to the Catholic Church After Vatican II, which is the most comprehensive book ever produced on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:21.020]  I think so.
[00:40:42.762 --> 00:40:48.104]  Where you can mail in your order to us at Most Holy Family Monastery, 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, New York, 14735.
[00:40:48.944 --> 00:40:52.845]  The price of the whole package is $10, which includes media mail shipping.
[00:40:52.865 --> 00:40:56.467]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:40:56.747 --> 00:41:06.970]  Mostholyfamilymonastery.com News, politics, sports, cars, home improvement, health, and everything in between, we've got you covered.
[00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:09.291]  You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[00:41:14.159 --> 00:41:23.304]  Coming to you from the capital of Texas, broadcasting the truth coast to coast and worldwide, this is the Alex Jones Show!
[00:41:23.324 --> 00:41:23.344]  877-590...
[00:41:32.346 --> 00:41:33.126]  5-5-2-5-8-7-7-5-9-8-5-5-2-5-8-3-6-0-5-9-8.
[00:41:33.286 --> 00:41:40.749]  I'm going to go back to your calls, and I'm going to get into this big controversy.
[00:41:41.129 --> 00:41:42.389]  I interviewed Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:41:42.409 --> 00:41:45.850]  He's running for president, as I do each month for the last 12 years.
[00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:51.172]  And I talked about the government staging a Gulf of Tonkin provocation.
[00:41:51.192 --> 00:41:53.313]  For those who don't know what it is, we'll recap what happened.
[00:41:53.333 --> 00:41:54.713]  What got us fully into the Vietnam War.
[00:41:55.233 --> 00:41:57.974]  He is at a danger right now, and he said, oh, it's a great danger.
[00:41:59.341 --> 00:42:05.283]  And then Fox News, CNN, Breitbart, all these drug reports picked it up and spun it.
[00:42:05.763 --> 00:42:09.124]  Ron Paul says the government is going to stage terror attacks inside the U.S.
[00:42:10.304 --> 00:42:10.684]  No, no, no.
[00:42:11.024 --> 00:42:11.984]  We don't say it's the U.S.
[00:42:12.004 --> 00:42:12.304]  government.
[00:42:12.364 --> 00:42:13.925]  Criminal groups that run our government.
[00:42:14.245 --> 00:42:15.085]  And I say that.
[00:42:15.785 --> 00:42:17.406]  And all these other experts say that.
[00:42:17.466 --> 00:42:18.346]  And the history says that.
[00:42:18.366 --> 00:42:19.426]  And our own declassified U.S.
[00:42:19.466 --> 00:42:20.847]  government documents say that.
[00:42:21.147 --> 00:42:22.167]  Ron Paul doesn't say that.
[00:42:22.787 --> 00:42:25.748]  He hasn't committed political Harry Carey quite yet.
[00:42:26.391 --> 00:42:32.074]  Just because the mainstream media, the dying, hang on by its fingernails mainstream media, would have of that.
[00:42:33.794 --> 00:42:40.838]  I'll actually play a clip of Ron Paul earlier this year talking about Gulf of Tonkin, and then go over some of how the media tried to spin that.
[00:42:40.858 --> 00:42:42.438]  It was quite interesting.
[00:42:42.719 --> 00:42:49.262]  You can also call in about any of the issues Ron Paul is discussing, because he also brought up the fact that the dollar dropped again this week.
[00:42:49.282 --> 00:42:51.563]  It dropped almost a cent last week.
[00:42:53.648 --> 00:42:54.728]  Man, I'm really freaked out.
[00:42:54.748 --> 00:43:05.795]  I mean, it's a good thing that I'm not too big a lover of money, because my children's meager college funds that I've tried to save have been devalued by more than half in the last seven years.
[00:43:07.956 --> 00:43:09.297]  And everything's being devalued.
[00:43:09.337 --> 00:43:10.858]  It's absolutely incredible.
[00:43:12.856 --> 00:43:20.200]  You see the stock market plunge and the plunge protection team goes in and puts in hundreds of billions of dollars a day in some cases of purchases.
[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:22.081]  It's all fiat zeros and ones.
[00:43:22.421 --> 00:43:25.403]  Foreign countries aren't buying our securities like they were.
[00:43:25.423 --> 00:43:27.464]  They're moving quietly away from the dollar.
[00:43:27.644 --> 00:43:28.485]  I'm pretty freaked out.
[00:43:30.306 --> 00:43:32.147]  But I'm almost in denial like the general public.
[00:43:32.167 --> 00:43:33.687]  I'm just like, well, you know, what do you do?
[00:43:34.828 --> 00:43:38.210]  If we were able to expose the New World Order and the fact that they were behind
[00:43:39.056 --> 00:43:40.076]  This devaluation.
[00:43:40.116 --> 00:43:42.977]  They might put in place policies that would save the dollar.
[00:43:43.237 --> 00:43:50.259]  But there is a policy that Treasury Secretary Snowe announced four and a half years ago.
[00:43:50.279 --> 00:43:51.719]  Never forget, I was in Kansas City.
[00:43:51.739 --> 00:43:53.780]  The dollar had already dropped about 10 cents to the euro.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.621]  But the euro still hadn't overtaken the dollar.
[00:43:57.121 --> 00:43:58.621]  It was at about 92 cents.
[00:43:58.821 --> 00:44:04.323]  It came out in 2000 at 82 cents to the dollar at one dollar value.
[00:44:04.363 --> 00:44:05.023]  Now it's at 138.7.
[00:44:05.103 --> 00:44:06.203]  That's a 50 plus cent
[00:44:09.052 --> 00:44:12.955]  57 or 58 cent decrease, or no, 56 cent decrease.
[00:44:14.596 --> 00:44:19.899]  And folks, if you don't know what this stuff means, I'm talking about, A, it's real simple, B, you better go find out real fast.
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:30.566]  Because you can believe that Sunnis are Shiites all day, or that, you know, the government, the Pentagon considered using Al-Qaeda to attack Iran, but that Iran is Al-Qaeda and attacking our troops.
[00:44:31.027 --> 00:44:36.410]  I mean, you can believe that delusion if you want, but if you keep believing the delusion about our dollar, things are going to get real tough.
[00:44:38.661 --> 00:44:39.281]  God help us.
[00:44:39.682 --> 00:44:45.986]  By the way, the Federal Reserve had been racing printing lots of money, which even though they were devaluing it, at least there was more of it in circulation.
[00:44:46.346 --> 00:44:47.187]  So it's kind of a catch-22.
[00:44:47.307 --> 00:44:50.169]  Now they're not accelerating the printing anymore.
[00:44:50.269 --> 00:45:00.015]  Now it looks like they're starting to restrict lending and the number of zeros and ones in the fractional reserve system of the Federal Reserve cartel.
[00:45:00.875 --> 00:45:02.116]  And it's not pretty.
[00:45:02.537 --> 00:45:03.377]  Real inflation is at 13.6%.
[00:45:05.982 --> 00:45:09.527]  And the pucker factor is off the chart right now.
[00:45:09.547 --> 00:45:12.651]  At least for those that happen to be concerned about any of this stuff.
[00:45:12.971 --> 00:45:14.313]  Alright, let's jam through some calls here.
[00:45:15.014 --> 00:45:21.101]  Let's talk to Mike in Southeast Texas.
[00:45:21.201 --> 00:45:22.964]  You are on the air, sir.
[00:45:23.064 --> 00:45:24.846]  Thank you for holding.
[00:45:25.615 --> 00:45:27.557]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[00:45:27.817 --> 00:45:30.419]  I want to make a comment about the Michael Chertoff comment.
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:34.162]  Keith Overman really made a really good one out of him.
[00:45:34.242 --> 00:45:35.383]  I mean, he laid it out.
[00:45:35.643 --> 00:45:37.164]  Yeah, Chertoff's gut.
[00:45:37.765 --> 00:45:39.386]  Yeah, about his gut.
[00:45:39.506 --> 00:45:40.727]  And you're worried about your gut.
[00:45:41.968 --> 00:45:44.731]  You know, I tell you, it just makes me want to laugh.
[00:45:44.751 --> 00:45:48.634]  What's happening is Chertoff and his gut knows we're waking up about government-sponsored terror.
[00:45:49.136 --> 00:45:49.476]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:49.576 --> 00:45:52.977]  Now, the other thing I'd like to talk to you about, I'd like to switch gears real quick.
[00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:54.778]  This is about another national disgrace.
[00:45:54.818 --> 00:45:55.798]  You ready to hear this one?
[00:45:56.318 --> 00:45:56.919]  Go ahead and tell me.
[00:45:57.519 --> 00:46:01.700]  You remember, I heard about the Saturn V rocket, the best rocket this country's ever had.
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:08.502]  Sure, it was developed by Werner Von Braun, the Nazi head of Hitler's Vengeance Weapon II program.
[00:46:09.082 --> 00:46:16.625]  Well, about ten years ago, there was an article in Pomp and Circumstance claiming that they lost all the blueprints to that great rocket, and then
[00:46:17.461 --> 00:46:19.982]  Then it's come out and said, no, they haven't lost the blueprints.
[00:46:20.802 --> 00:46:23.343]  They have them in some obsolete computer format.
[00:46:24.003 --> 00:46:40.990]  And according to Richard C. Hoagland, who's been on the Art Bell program, mentioned that after the Apollo program ended and then the Skylab program ended in 1974 when the rocket was decommissioned, the FBI went to all the main contractors of the Saturn, Boeing, McDonnell Electric, I mean McDonnell Douglas,
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:54.381]  Well, that's interesting.
[00:46:54.642 --> 00:46:56.622]  I don't believe that for a minute.
[00:46:56.902 --> 00:47:04.523]  I know the Saturn V was designed predominantly by Werner Von Braun, also Goddard, and a few others.
[00:47:04.564 --> 00:47:06.824]  But it wasn't just Nazis running on our rockets, folks.
[00:47:08.204 --> 00:47:10.065]  My grandfather met Werner Von Braun.
[00:47:10.445 --> 00:47:11.125]  He was a pretty nice guy.
[00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:17.470]  I mean, the point is that he was the head Nazi over the program.
[00:47:19.291 --> 00:47:28.613]  And there were people who weren't as separated from the death camps as von Braun, though he shot Vengeance Weapon IIs at England and killed quite a few people.
[00:47:29.693 --> 00:47:31.313]  That's what the V2 is, Vengeance Weapon.
[00:47:31.333 --> 00:47:31.993]  What a name.
[00:47:32.373 --> 00:47:34.634]  Vengeance Weapon II is what Hitler named it.
[00:47:35.594 --> 00:47:37.274]  But that's actually in Endgame.
[00:47:37.294 --> 00:47:39.515]  It's the only reason I'm fully versed on that right now.
[00:47:41.947 --> 00:47:42.767]  I'm already digressing.
[00:47:42.967 --> 00:47:45.390]  Let's just go ahead and take some more calls here.
[00:47:46.531 --> 00:47:50.234]  Let's take a call here from Arthur in Connecticut.
[00:47:50.474 --> 00:47:50.995]  You're on the air.
[00:47:51.055 --> 00:47:51.595]  Thanks for holding.
[00:47:52.696 --> 00:47:53.377]  Greetings, Alex.
[00:47:53.477 --> 00:47:57.300]  In the name of the King, Jesus Christ, I'm enjoying the show as always.
[00:47:57.901 --> 00:48:01.083]  Usually too busy to listen on Sundays, but I thought I'd pass several.
[00:48:01.104 --> 00:48:02.305]  Well, I'm glad you're tuned in, sir.
[00:48:02.325 --> 00:48:03.626]  Talk right into your telephone for me.
[00:48:04.126 --> 00:48:04.647]  Oh, thank you.
[00:48:04.687 --> 00:48:05.367]  It's a cell phone.
[00:48:05.387 --> 00:48:06.268]  That's all I can afford.
[00:48:06.328 --> 00:48:06.508]  No, no.
[00:48:06.528 --> 00:48:06.929]  I understand.
[00:48:06.949 --> 00:48:07.229]  Go ahead.
[00:48:07.762 --> 00:48:13.188]  Yeah, I needed to talk to you about this common thread that runs through all the attorneys.
[00:48:13.748 --> 00:48:14.970]  They're certainly not lawyers.
[00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:16.511]  They're certainly not counselors.
[00:48:17.392 --> 00:48:28.224]  And the cops have, as you said during your other programs, and perhaps on the Sunday ones as well, they are the equivalent of nothing but private corporation guns, hired guns.
[00:48:29.153 --> 00:48:39.655]  Well, since 1933, we fully went under Admiralty Law, and the separate corporate United States of America began subdividing and taking over.
[00:48:39.675 --> 00:48:47.557]  You know, kind of like in the movie The Thing, it takes over the organism, and they've got thousands of books and documents, they all brag about it, and they just are taking it.
[00:48:47.617 --> 00:48:55.739]  And now, they've basically taken 80% of the economy and the culture and the infrastructure over, and they don't even need a free market anymore, and they say they're going to get rid of it now.
[00:48:56.451 --> 00:48:57.632]  Yes, indeed.
[00:48:57.692 --> 00:49:00.154]  Along with most of us, yes.
[00:49:01.275 --> 00:49:03.958]  Yes, well, that's part of the package, isn't it?
[00:49:04.258 --> 00:49:05.279]  That's all they talk about.
[00:49:05.319 --> 00:49:06.360]  Yeah, that's their main thing.
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:08.942]  Yeah, British Accredited Registry.
[00:49:09.663 --> 00:49:12.305]  And don't hire anybody for a judge here.
[00:49:12.345 --> 00:49:21.373]  The so-called Superior Court took a cue from the probate court here in West Hartford, somebody named Sidney Elkin, who has a history.
[00:49:21.869 --> 00:49:22.529]  of framing me.
[00:49:22.589 --> 00:49:28.632]  I've been framed twice now here in West Hartford, Connecticut by both the West Hartford Police Department, Farmington Police Department, and Sidney Elkin.
[00:49:29.052 --> 00:49:31.774]  He was Traffic Court Prosecutor in West Hartford in the late 80's.
[00:49:31.894 --> 00:49:35.555]  No, I understand, but I mean, just mentioning some guy on the air isn't going to do anything.
[00:49:35.595 --> 00:49:47.541]  What you need to do is you need to write it all up and start your own blog or website and, you know, call it the name of your town watchman or Herald or Chronicle and make it, it's easy.
[00:49:47.781 --> 00:49:49.462]  I mean, go find somebody to build a site for you.
[00:49:49.921 --> 00:49:55.804]  You can hire some 15 year old kid, probably a couple hundred bucks to build you a website.
[00:49:56.524 --> 00:49:58.085]  My point is you have to know how to do it.
[00:49:58.405 --> 00:50:00.806]  Then once a week when you write an article, give it to him and he'll post it.
[00:50:01.747 --> 00:50:02.647]  That'll freak them out.
[00:50:02.707 --> 00:50:03.648]  That'll get them on the run.
[00:50:04.008 --> 00:50:05.389]  Chronicle all this stuff.
[00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:13.053]  Because we get a lot of callers calling, great folks like yourself, and they think just rattling off the names of some people in their town is going to do something to them.
[00:50:13.353 --> 00:50:13.753]  And it's not.
[00:50:13.773 --> 00:50:17.875]  If you really want to get these people back, you've got to go ferret out all the dirt on them.
[00:50:18.524 --> 00:50:26.692]  And a lot of these corrupt officials, authorities, no longer servants, all the names are changed, most of them are involved in some form of corruption.
[00:50:27.272 --> 00:50:34.619]  You want to get really serious, don't stalk them, don't get up in their space, you're doing a media investigation, start following them around with a video camera.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.803]  Just once a week, stake out their place and follow them.
[00:50:39.403 --> 00:50:42.106]  And you know, when the local judge goes to the gay bar,
[00:50:42.805 --> 00:50:45.326]  You know, you just post a video, I'm walking into it.
[00:50:45.586 --> 00:50:46.987]  Hey, you wanna play hardball with me?
[00:50:47.007 --> 00:50:48.647]  You think I'm here to be run over?
[00:50:48.667 --> 00:50:50.128]  You think I'm here to be your slave?
[00:50:50.328 --> 00:50:51.809]  Let's see how you like this, Mac!
[00:50:52.449 --> 00:50:54.150]  Let's see how your wife likes seeing this!
[00:50:56.410 --> 00:50:58.171]  Because you see, they don't have any conscience for you.
[00:50:59.292 --> 00:51:01.012]  Setting you up, putting you in jail.
[00:51:01.652 --> 00:51:04.734]  I mean, I see videos every day of cops beating people up.
[00:51:04.754 --> 00:51:07.775]  They'll just beat you up and then charge you with assaulting them.
[00:51:08.758 --> 00:51:10.439]  Beating you up like you're not a human being.
[00:51:10.679 --> 00:51:11.560]  Sending you to jail.
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:12.941]  Putting false charges on you.
[00:51:13.521 --> 00:51:16.984]  Well, all you do is you find out who they are, and if it takes two years, you do it.
[00:51:17.664 --> 00:51:19.145]  Somebody that can frame somebody.
[00:51:19.165 --> 00:51:19.846]  Somebody can do that.
[00:51:19.886 --> 00:51:21.947]  I guarantee you is involved in evil.
[00:51:22.407 --> 00:51:28.692]  You just start following them around one day a week, videotaping them, and then you can torpedo them.
[00:51:29.893 --> 00:51:33.155]  I mean, I mean, sir, let's not play at war, okay?
[00:51:33.755 --> 00:51:35.817]  Giving out their names on the radio doesn't really do very much.
[00:51:36.837 --> 00:51:37.638]  What you do is,
[00:51:38.777 --> 00:51:43.224]  We've sent a couple of people here locally to prison and we'll send more.
[00:51:43.745 --> 00:51:44.365]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:44.385 --> 00:51:44.746]  Stay with us.
[00:51:50.899 --> 00:51:51.799]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[00:51:51.819 --> 00:51:58.961]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[00:51:59.221 --> 00:52:02.121]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[00:52:02.321 --> 00:52:07.962]  If you have a business product or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.
[00:52:07.983 --> 00:52:10.723]  For national exposure, call 877-996-4327.
[00:52:12.663 --> 00:52:17.124]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station or call the national line at 877-996-4327.
[00:52:22.046 --> 00:52:24.527]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:52:24.988 --> 00:52:26.909]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:52:27.609 --> 00:52:30.771]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:52:31.431 --> 00:52:37.895]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:52:38.675 --> 00:52:40.876]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:52:41.256 --> 00:52:41.697]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:41.857 --> 00:52:43.097]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:43.138 --> 00:52:43.898]  Thank you.
[00:52:58.376 --> 00:52:59.416]  He stands for truth.
[00:52:59.476 --> 00:53:00.797]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:00.817 --> 00:53:02.198]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:02.218 --> 00:53:03.738]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:03.758 --> 00:53:05.199]  Call Alex now, toll free.
[00:53:22.344 --> 00:53:22.525]  At 877-590-5525.
[00:53:22.545 --> 00:53:26.653]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:53:36.531 --> 00:53:41.953]  We are now back into this second hour of the Sunday live broadcast.
[00:53:42.033 --> 00:53:43.573]  I do every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:53:43.993 --> 00:53:44.393]  Central.
[00:53:44.413 --> 00:53:48.014]  If you're listening in upstate New York on the Sunshine Network, that'd be 5 to 7 Eastern.
[00:53:48.074 --> 00:53:53.356]  If you're listening out in Southern California, one of our affiliates, that'd be, what, 2 to 4 Pacific.
[00:53:53.396 --> 00:53:55.576]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:53:55.716 --> 00:54:00.898]  I know that we have loaded phones here, and I want to get to your calls.
[00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:02.531]  We're going to do that right now.
[00:54:02.671 --> 00:54:15.199]  Then I'm going to get into Fox News and others attacking Congressman Ron Paul, trying to misconstrue some of the things that he said on my radio show, weekday show, Thursday, concerning government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:20.883]  And we will also spend about 15 minutes at least, I want to read to you some famous Newell Water quotes.
[00:54:21.404 --> 00:54:26.227]  I read some a few weeks ago, but I'm doing so much research right now,
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:31.501]  On population reduction, the plan to kill 80% of us.
[00:54:32.741 --> 00:54:39.563]  For the end of my film, Endgame, where we had crews in Istanbul, Turkey, Ottawa, Canada.
[00:54:39.583 --> 00:54:41.184]  I mean, I've been all over the place on this.
[00:54:42.284 --> 00:54:45.165]  Going and showing the Global Elites meeting, the Global Mafia meeting.
[00:54:46.265 --> 00:54:47.265]  That's only the first of the film.
[00:54:47.305 --> 00:54:50.746]  Then we get into their master plan, what they're setting up, their own documents.
[00:54:52.246 --> 00:54:54.487]  And I have to tell you, words cannot describe
[00:54:56.516 --> 00:54:57.617]  How staggered I am.
[00:54:58.957 --> 00:55:03.499]  How dumbfounded, how just... It's a humdinger.
[00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:15.324]  Just when I think I know how evil the New Old Order is, just when I think I know their game plan and what they're up to and how bad they are, I still tend to add some humanity to them.
[00:55:15.364 --> 00:55:24.127]  I still tend to think, well, they're misguided or, you know, they're just a bunch of control freaks or they're fallen people, they're dumb, they're just brutish.
[00:55:24.828 --> 00:55:25.508]  Man, these people,
[00:55:27.381 --> 00:55:28.202]  No exaggeration.
[00:55:28.342 --> 00:55:32.305]  I've probably read excerpts out of a hundred plus books the last six months.
[00:55:33.025 --> 00:55:35.367]  Really heavy research the last month and a half.
[00:55:36.968 --> 00:55:42.432]  And thousands of government documents, State Department document 200, Memorandum 200.
[00:55:43.973 --> 00:55:47.835]  Last time I was reading that, again I read it many times, I was rereading it.
[00:55:48.676 --> 00:55:56.982]  And quotes from architects of the New World Order and all these Nobel Prize winners and presidents and prime ministers and I mean they come right out and call us scum.
[00:55:58.004 --> 00:56:23.685]  They come right out and say, and I'm talking 70, 80 years ago, they said we're going to force drug you, we're going to have all these weapons systems and cops in black uniforms and we're going to take your children from you and we're going to dumb you down and then we're going to exterminate most of you and I mean in 1915 they're saying we're going to have atomic bombs and we're going to have a Soviet Union and we're going to take over China.
[00:56:23.765 --> 00:56:24.906]  I mean they did it all.
[00:56:25.066 --> 00:56:26.547]  I mean it's all documented.
[00:56:27.259 --> 00:56:32.661]  And all these big conservative leaders actually writing quotes about how they're for the Soviet Union and Sovietism.
[00:56:32.721 --> 00:56:35.202]  I mean, my God, folks, we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:56:35.782 --> 00:56:36.923]  I can't even believe I'm alive.
[00:56:36.943 --> 00:56:41.024]  But they're so arrogant, they just don't even care.
[00:56:42.264 --> 00:56:44.885]  And I've had pretty high-level globalists a few times I've run into them.
[00:56:46.826 --> 00:56:54.749]  I've had them come up to me in restaurants, or on the hiking bike trail, or I've been out in L.A., or I've had big corporate meetings, and they'll just go, yeah, there's a world government and the dumb public
[00:56:55.563 --> 00:56:56.304]  Pointing out their window.
[00:56:56.584 --> 00:56:57.705]  Down there doesn't care, Alex.
[00:56:57.725 --> 00:56:58.866]  They don't care if you want to help them.
[00:56:59.086 --> 00:57:00.527]  And they'll bite you in the hind end in a minute.
[00:57:00.767 --> 00:57:02.629]  You ought to join us and care about your family.
[00:57:02.869 --> 00:57:03.730]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:05.191]  Those people are idiots.
[00:57:06.772 --> 00:57:07.813]  And they don't want your help.
[00:57:07.853 --> 00:57:08.754]  They want to be stupid.
[00:57:11.876 --> 00:57:17.081]  And then I see the media openly admitting that Al-Qaeda works for the U.S.
[00:57:17.121 --> 00:57:18.642]  government and is attacking Iran.
[00:57:18.662 --> 00:57:24.547]  And then the media also says Iran is Al-Qaeda when it's the opposite group.
[00:57:25.362 --> 00:57:33.191]  And I heard the news earlier, you know, they're still saying a day and a half after they know it's a six-plus-year-old tape, that Nubin Laden tape, he's going to get us.
[00:57:35.534 --> 00:57:36.755]  Let me read you Bertrand Russell.
[00:57:36.775 --> 00:57:45.065]  He's a Nobel Prize winner, the head of the British Thalian Socialist Society, friends with the Queen and the King, one of the top people.
[00:57:46.036 --> 00:57:49.940]  I mean, he's Time Magazine Top 100 People, just like Margaret Sanger.
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:59.369]  And I have the actual letters from the College Archive, where she calls black people subhuman weeds and says, we can't let them learn that we want to exterminate all of them with Planned Parenthood.
[00:58:00.891 --> 00:58:02.332]  You know, I mean, I got the letter.
[00:58:03.584 --> 00:58:05.484]  And there's hundreds of quotes from her and stuff.
[00:58:05.504 --> 00:58:12.506]  She wrote awards from Hitler, and giving awards to him, and Hitler quoting her, and, you know, praising her, and just all of this.
[00:58:12.986 --> 00:58:18.827]  And she's in Time Magazine, says she's great, top 100 people, and oh, she's so feminist, she loves women so much.
[00:58:19.887 --> 00:58:23.448]  Bertrand Russell, go read, oh, he's so sweet, he's so good, he's so nice.
[00:58:24.488 --> 00:58:33.330]  Man, I started reading his writings, and I thought, well, maybe this is just him being tongue-in-cheek, so I bought books he wrote, and read more quotes, and look, he's a scumbag!
[00:58:34.921 --> 00:58:37.804]  One of the people that works for me looked at him and said, he looks like a real piece of garbage.
[00:58:38.325 --> 00:58:39.606]  He had different words than that.
[00:58:40.507 --> 00:58:41.888]  But listen to what this guy wrote.
[00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:49.295]  Diet injections, that's vaccines full of mercury, and he goes on to talk about that.
[00:58:49.836 --> 00:58:50.817]  This is 80 years ago.
[00:58:50.837 --> 00:58:54.200]  We're going to inject you with mercury to make you dumb.
[00:58:55.263 --> 00:58:56.084]  Oh, God help us.
[00:58:56.524 --> 00:58:57.324]  Oh, heaven help us.
[00:58:57.464 --> 00:59:01.086]  And again, he even can say it right out in the open, and he knows you don't read.
[00:59:01.646 --> 00:59:04.948]  And if you hear somebody like me, you'll just go, that's some crazy street preacher.
[00:59:06.408 --> 00:59:07.769]  So they can say it right out in the open.
[00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:08.109]  Listen to this.
[00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:17.054]  Diet injections and injunctions will combine from a very early age to produce a sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authoritarians consider desirable.
[00:59:17.694 --> 00:59:21.916]  And any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible.
[00:59:23.553 --> 00:59:27.554]  Here's another quote from the Impact of Science on Society, 1953, page 4950.
[00:59:31.655 --> 00:59:41.117]  Gradually, by selective breeding, the congenital differences between rulers and ruled will increase until they become almost different species.
[00:59:41.337 --> 00:59:41.957]  Let me read that again.
[00:59:42.977 --> 00:59:52.539]  Generally, gradually, by selective breeding, the congenital differences between rulers and the ruled will increase until they become almost
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:53.980]  Different species.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.342]  And it's not just him, it's hundreds of top eugenicists.
[00:59:57.622 --> 01:00:00.123]  Who, by the way, picking eugenicists, pick the head of any field.
[01:00:00.183 --> 01:00:01.343]  It's always eugenicists.
[01:00:01.923 --> 01:00:03.444]  I haven't found a case where they are.
[01:00:04.785 --> 01:00:15.929]  A revolt of the plebes would become as unthinkable as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating mutton.
[01:00:17.239 --> 01:00:20.300]  And of course our vocabulary has been reduced so greatly that I'm not knocking you.
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:21.860]  They've dumbed you down on purpose, they've dumbed me down.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.101]  Mutton is sheep.
[01:00:24.661 --> 01:00:26.262]  Somebody back then reading that would have known that.
[01:00:27.282 --> 01:00:37.925]  So he says, a revolt of the plebes would become as unthinkable, that's the general public, as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating mutton.
[01:00:40.186 --> 01:00:45.107]  And there's a bunch of other evil quotes from him.
[01:00:47.325 --> 01:00:49.286]  And I mean, there's all these New World Order quotes from him.
[01:00:52.169 --> 01:00:54.151]  All these quotes, and they all say it.
[01:00:55.732 --> 01:01:08.944]  And they say, we're going to take over and get 20% of the population on psychotropic drugs, hallucinogenic drugs, and then of course you find out that it was the CIA and the publishers of Time
[01:01:09.542 --> 01:01:13.506]  Life Books, who were big into LSD, they have the CIA put it out.
[01:01:13.786 --> 01:01:18.370]  They caused the whole drug revolution, as quote, counterculture, to get you on drugs.
[01:01:19.271 --> 01:01:22.313]  They created the whole drug war to then imprison you once you're on them.
[01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:24.395]  I mean, that's all mainstream history.
[01:01:24.976 --> 01:01:34.564]  So see what genius that is, wicked genius, that they ship in drugs, and if you use the illegal ones you go to prison, then they try to force you to go on drugs that have even more dangerous molecular makeups.
[01:01:35.232 --> 01:01:39.953]  And an even greater effect on the brain that puts you in a mesmerized, highly suggestible state.
[01:01:41.536 --> 01:02:05.119]  And they write thousands of books and hundreds of papers and I mean to read Henry Kissinger saying it's the national security interest to exterminate the third world and to use food as a weapon and modern mercantilism we're going to de-industrialize the US and the third world and everyone so no one has jobs so only government can run everything and then take all the assets that are left and give it on to the banker owners.
[01:02:06.815 --> 01:02:10.518]  And they're so arrogant, folks, they call you dumb slaves.
[01:02:10.538 --> 01:02:11.679]  They call you scum.
[01:02:12.079 --> 01:02:13.180]  They call you sheep.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:18.203]  And they laugh and say, we can write this, the sheep will never even read it.
[01:02:18.504 --> 01:02:19.364]  Ha ha ha!
[01:02:21.086 --> 01:02:24.508]  I mean, I've never seen anything like it.
[01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:30.532]  And, I mean, if you like being gamed or played, okay.
[01:02:31.193 --> 01:02:32.514]  But don't say you weren't warned.
[01:02:33.251 --> 01:02:34.952]  Don't say somebody didn't come up here and warn you.
[01:02:35.292 --> 01:02:36.933]  Come back, take calls, get into Ron Paul.
[01:02:37.413 --> 01:02:38.894]  Then we'll get into more of these quotes.
[01:02:39.594 --> 01:02:41.115]  PrisonPlanet.com is the website.
[01:02:41.135 --> 01:02:41.616]  Stay with us.
[01:02:55.422 --> 01:03:00.910]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:01.251 --> 01:03:08.882]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:03:09.597 --> 01:03:16.662]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:03:17.042 --> 01:03:28.450]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:32.713]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:03:32.733 --> 01:03:34.675]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:03:35.015 --> 01:03:38.858]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:52.225 --> 01:04:55.549]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[01:04:55.849 --> 01:04:58.692]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[01:04:59.192 --> 01:05:01.395]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[01:05:02.015 --> 01:05:10.324]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[01:05:10.805 --> 01:05:11.345]  An example?
[01:05:11.886 --> 01:05:14.689]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[01:05:15.575 --> 01:05:18.358]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[01:05:18.719 --> 01:05:22.062]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[01:05:22.783 --> 01:05:27.968]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[01:05:28.609 --> 01:05:30.091]  Money is not the problem.
[01:05:30.311 --> 01:05:31.312]  Availability is.
[01:05:31.833 --> 01:05:32.293]  Be careful.
[01:05:32.333 --> 01:05:37.579]  When food supplies get short, with no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.

[01:05:52.150 --> 01:06:00.994]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water, a world in which our produce is grown naturally, without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[01:06:01.474 --> 01:06:03.615]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[01:06:03.795 --> 01:06:14.540]  These toxins enter our bodies, and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body, with more than 500 vital functions.
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:24.044]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.
[01:06:24.384 --> 01:06:27.085]  And it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.
[01:06:27.446 --> 01:06:34.769]  LIV52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol and prescription medications.
[01:06:35.129 --> 01:06:37.830]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:07:03.551 --> 01:07:05.532]  Raging for the truth.
[01:07:05.592 --> 01:07:07.713]  Exposing corruption.
[01:07:07.813 --> 01:07:10.935]  Dismantling the false left-right paradigm.
[01:07:11.035 --> 01:07:12.976]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.257 --> 01:07:17.478]  Let me just put it in a nutshell, and I'm going to shove about eugenics until the end of the show.
[01:07:17.538 --> 01:07:18.219]  Take some calls.
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:23.361]  My daughter had a little recital yesterday.
[01:07:24.782 --> 01:07:26.603]  So my parents came over.
[01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:27.604]  We drove with them.
[01:07:28.564 --> 01:07:30.425]  My mother had been listening to the radio show last week.
[01:07:30.445 --> 01:07:31.686]  We did a three-part series.
[01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:36.351]  On eugenics and its history, she goes, well, is it really that bad?
[01:07:36.371 --> 01:07:39.452]  You know, she's got a degree in history, she's not stupid herself.
[01:07:39.772 --> 01:07:42.713]  She goes, I know there's a lot of that, but is it really running almost everything?
[01:07:43.473 --> 01:07:52.475]  And I said, oh yeah, and I said, it's the dominant, you'll find eugenicists in every key position, and the whole world view is shaped, everything they do is shaped on that.
[01:07:52.895 --> 01:07:54.115]  Foreign policy, everything.
[01:07:54.916 --> 01:07:56.836]  My dad goes, oh yeah, I never told you about this.
[01:07:56.856 --> 01:07:59.777]  You know, my dad was top of his class in high school, then he went to UT later.
[01:08:00.362 --> 01:08:05.286]  And so he was in that college program when he was a junior and senior at UT.
[01:08:05.406 --> 01:08:07.168]  And he was listening to a bunch of the top professors.
[01:08:07.188 --> 01:08:08.529]  My mom's like, oh I had him.
[01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:10.670]  And my wife said, oh I had him too.
[01:08:11.151 --> 01:08:11.891]  She went to UT.
[01:08:12.972 --> 01:08:19.658]  And yeah, they would call all the valedictorians and salutatorians together and go, this is a huge eugenics plan.
[01:08:19.698 --> 01:08:20.859]  We're taking over America.
[01:08:21.159 --> 01:08:22.380]  We're going to be a technocracy.
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:25.002]  My dad just kind of always stays out of this stuff.
[01:08:25.022 --> 01:08:25.943]  He knows what's going on.
[01:08:26.795 --> 01:08:30.238]  You know, he sent Ron Paul some money, and you know, he knows what's happening in politics.
[01:08:30.318 --> 01:08:33.140]  It's his view that society's always, you know, been run by these people.
[01:08:33.521 --> 01:08:37.084]  But I mean, my point is, is that he goes, oh yeah, they all brought us in and told us this too.
[01:08:37.104 --> 01:08:38.645]  See, I mean, it's just everywhere!
[01:08:38.965 --> 01:08:42.629]  And he goes, I hadn't really thought about that since then, since I was 16 years old.
[01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:46.152]  They were telling him, you're God's gift to the planet.
[01:08:46.732 --> 01:08:48.153]  Oh, your genetics are superior.
[01:08:48.414 --> 01:08:50.235]  You're going to be running the technocracy.
[01:08:50.515 --> 01:08:52.357]  These scum don't know what they're doing.
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:57.101]  And folks, that is the attitude of the people running things.
[01:08:57.321 --> 01:08:58.281]  And that rolls downhill.
[01:08:58.321 --> 01:09:00.562]  They tell the cops, you're here to mind the public.
[01:09:00.582 --> 01:09:01.522]  You're here to boss them around.
[01:09:01.722 --> 01:09:02.742]  They're a bunch of idiots.
[01:09:03.142 --> 01:09:06.123]  And as the new old order conditioning kicks in, people are turning into animals.
[01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:08.884]  People don't know anything now.
[01:09:08.924 --> 01:09:10.184]  They can't even hardly read.
[01:09:11.185 --> 01:09:16.226]  Or the words that they were using, the meanings have been changed, where you can't even properly communicate with somebody.
[01:09:17.046 --> 01:09:23.808]  It's kind of like an idiocracy put out by Mike Judge, which in a weird way has its own eugenics message at the start, but I think he's commenting on that.
[01:09:24.645 --> 01:09:28.286]  And the guy, 500 years in the future or whatever, wakes up and everybody's completely stupid.
[01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:30.146]  And he's like a genius.
[01:09:30.406 --> 01:09:33.807]  And he was like a blue-collar guy before.
[01:09:33.847 --> 01:09:35.547]  He's going to become the king, basically.
[01:09:36.207 --> 01:09:38.548]  You know, because they're feeding Gatorade to the plants.
[01:09:39.768 --> 01:09:45.809]  And they all think he'll be like, well, I have rights when he goes into the court.
[01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:46.889]  And they go, what are you?
[01:09:46.909 --> 01:09:48.249]  What are you, gay?
[01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:50.090]  And that's basically already how it is.
[01:09:50.110 --> 01:09:50.870]  You're like, well, you know,
[01:09:52.725 --> 01:09:57.468]  I had some neighbors at my office, they wanted to turf for some reason, and they walked in and they said, What's that?
[01:09:57.508 --> 01:10:06.433]  We had like the storyboard up and it said, you know, Eugenics, Hitler, it had like 50 cards on it, but just if someone sees the word Hitler, they think, Hitler?
[01:10:07.194 --> 01:10:08.134]  You're reading?
[01:10:08.154 --> 01:10:11.977]  And I had to explain that to them.
[01:10:12.617 --> 01:10:19.161]  I mean, I mean, it's scary, but see, I'm not going to use the fact that the public are completely dumbed down and mindless against them.
[01:10:20.123 --> 01:10:23.104]  But all these scam artists and media and government, man, they're all in on the game.
[01:10:23.144 --> 01:10:23.925]  It's a big joke!
[01:10:24.785 --> 01:10:28.406]  You start getting up to the level of people worth a hundred million, two hundred million, a billion dollars.
[01:10:28.426 --> 01:10:29.747]  You start getting into elite circles.
[01:10:29.787 --> 01:10:30.847]  You get into one of those meetings.
[01:10:31.087 --> 01:10:32.508]  You get into one of those cocktail parties.
[01:10:32.568 --> 01:10:35.149]  It's all they talk about is, they're the idiot scum.
[01:10:35.169 --> 01:10:36.369]  We're going to eliminate them.
[01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:40.351]  I mean, that's just, oh, morals are powerful.
[01:10:40.371 --> 01:10:43.092]  I mean, they're just doing this and you don't even know about it.
[01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:45.093]  And I'm here on air trying to warn you folks.
[01:10:47.791 --> 01:10:48.992]  And I've had the globalists tell me.
[01:10:49.292 --> 01:10:52.155]  You know, look, you see you warn them and they don't even want your help.
[01:10:52.235 --> 01:10:52.655]  See?
[01:10:52.755 --> 01:10:53.376]  Join us.
[01:10:54.396 --> 01:10:56.939]  Well, number one, I wouldn't sleep at night doing that.
[01:10:57.379 --> 01:11:00.141]  Number two, you guys are going to lose and you're part of evil.
[01:11:02.383 --> 01:11:03.844]  But I've already digressed here a lot.
[01:11:05.966 --> 01:11:10.730]  Let's go ahead and go to Tony and then we'll go to Mike, Ruben and Rick.
[01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:14.293]  Tony, you're on the air from Austin.
[01:11:14.333 --> 01:11:14.613]  Go ahead.
[01:11:15.512 --> 01:11:21.474]  Hey Alex, um, I've just been expecting Ron Paul to be on George Stephanopoulos this week, and he didn't show up.
[01:11:21.674 --> 01:11:22.954]  I just wondered if you knew anything.
[01:11:23.014 --> 01:11:24.355]  Why he hadn't turned up?
[01:11:24.475 --> 01:11:32.697]  And another thing, nobody seems to mention him on any of the political talk shows, even though he's coming on strong in the Republican Party.
[01:11:32.717 --> 01:11:33.998]  Hold on!
[01:11:34.178 --> 01:11:34.778]  Okay.
[01:11:34.818 --> 01:11:38.919]  Ron Paul is the only candidate in his party against the Iraq War from the start.
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.881]  A 10-term congressman from Texas... Matt Stephanopoulos right there, my friend.
[01:11:43.001 --> 01:11:43.941]  Oh, he was on this week?
[01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:45.642]  He wasn't on today.
[01:11:45.662 --> 01:11:45.702]  No.
[01:11:46.163 --> 01:11:48.065]  We announced two weeks ago he was going to be on.
[01:11:48.085 --> 01:11:51.668]  You probably heard a rebroadcaster, an internet podcast or something.
[01:11:51.748 --> 01:11:52.108]  Okay.
[01:11:52.829 --> 01:11:53.069]  Okay.
[01:11:53.089 --> 01:11:55.391]  Well anyway, since then he hasn't been mentioned anywhere.
[01:11:55.431 --> 01:11:57.433]  But anyway, thank you for sharing that with me.
[01:11:57.553 --> 01:11:58.294]  You bet, my friend.
[01:11:58.314 --> 01:11:59.094]  Good to hear from you.
[01:11:59.835 --> 01:12:04.880]  Now let's go ahead and take another call from Mike in Austin as well.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:06.021]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:12:06.041 --> 01:12:06.401]  Go ahead.
[01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:07.870]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:10.671]  I know that you don't watch as much TV as I do, but there's good news.
[01:12:10.731 --> 01:12:17.192]  I saw Janine Garofalo, the comedian on Conan O'Brien the other night, and she snuck in a 9-11 tidbit.
[01:12:17.292 --> 01:12:23.013]  She was doing a bit about how her comedy routine is not so well received sometimes that they don't get her humor.
[01:12:23.513 --> 01:12:32.235]  So she now was facetiously saying that she takes a little, she was pretending to hold up a little, so I ought to just hold up a little puppy to the crowd every time I say something about politics.
[01:12:32.876 --> 01:12:37.718]  And she said, for instance, 9-11 was an inside job, and then hold up a puppy, you know.
[01:12:37.998 --> 01:12:44.101]  But she snuck that in there, that phrase in there, amid her discourse with sitting at the chair with Conor O'Brien.
[01:12:44.121 --> 01:12:49.023]  And we now have a congressman doing it, and we have more and more people, because it is an inside job.
[01:12:49.623 --> 01:12:54.085]  The problem is the left didn't want to hear about Hillary and Clinton involved in the OKC op.
[01:12:55.085 --> 01:12:55.825]  Uh-huh, yeah.
[01:12:56.766 --> 01:12:58.206]  You see, it's bipartisan.
[01:12:58.706 --> 01:13:00.067]  That's why we're in so much trouble.
[01:13:00.606 --> 01:13:01.206]  That is true.
[01:13:01.246 --> 01:13:09.111]  I did want to make a comment about the fact that we can all make a little contribution if we all mailed just $5 to Ron Paul's campaign.
[01:13:09.452 --> 01:13:18.177]  If we all bought just 10 or 20 of those little congressional, those $1 booklets that you have on your site about the Bill of Rights and the power of jury and all that.
[01:13:18.497 --> 01:13:19.778]  Those are fantastic.
[01:13:19.798 --> 01:13:24.501]  I urge everybody to get at least, just buy 10 or 20 of them and pass them out to your friends, or a dollar each.
[01:13:25.154 --> 01:13:25.754]  Absolutely.
[01:13:25.794 --> 01:13:27.195]  It certainly is a process.
[01:13:27.215 --> 01:13:32.117]  In fact, we sell them for less than a dollar each when you get them in bulk at InfoWars.com.
[01:13:32.737 --> 01:13:38.819]  We give those away with any orders for books or videos on our online bookstore at InfoWars.com, The Citizen Rulebook.
[01:13:39.677 --> 01:13:43.262]  And we buy them in bulk and we sell them at cost.
[01:13:43.302 --> 01:13:45.245]  We are selling them at cost.
[01:13:46.267 --> 01:13:53.116]  Again, if you get an order of a documentary like Terrorist Storm or Loose Change or American Freedom from Fascism at InfoWars.com, you get one free.
[01:13:53.517 --> 01:13:56.441]  But if you want to order them, we are selling them in bulk at cost.
[01:13:57.418 --> 01:14:11.771]  In a little color-covered booklet, 67 pages long, Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, some famous founding father quotes, but I dare you just to read the Declaration of Independence online and then compare the things the government was doing then to what they're doing now.
[01:14:12.625 --> 01:14:13.625]  But let me give you the good news.
[01:14:13.645 --> 01:14:17.226]  You know, I get threatened by the police state because I know about history.
[01:14:17.266 --> 01:14:20.808]  But I want police listening to know, I don't mean you are the police state.
[01:14:21.168 --> 01:14:23.028]  I mean the system is the police state.
[01:14:23.529 --> 01:14:28.530]  And we really do have a lot of good police and a great military and wonderful firefighters who mean well.
[01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:40.554]  But you've been given bad systems, you've been brainwashed, you've been incrementally brought off the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and that's why you've been, you know, gone from being loved to now being disliked and despised.
[01:14:41.736 --> 01:14:42.816]  And that's how the New World Order wants it.
[01:14:42.836 --> 01:14:44.017]  They want us at each other's throats.
[01:14:44.557 --> 01:14:56.280]  I think one of the biggest mistakes I've made, none of us are perfect, but one of the biggest mistakes I've made in the last 12 years plus on air is that I have not been clear about that when I'm ranting and raving about cops.
[01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:58.061]  But man, I see YouTube videos all the time.
[01:14:58.101 --> 01:15:06.823]  I've seen it myself in Austin and New York and other places where, I mean, cops just beat up an unarmed innocent person because they feel like it, like a gang.
[01:15:07.423 --> 01:15:09.304]  And then they don't just beat you up.
[01:15:10.055 --> 01:15:11.975]  Then they also falsely charge you.
[01:15:12.476 --> 01:15:13.056]  And that's wrong.
[01:15:14.016 --> 01:15:16.916]  But the good news is, the people are waking up.
[01:15:17.357 --> 01:15:21.317]  The good news is, folks didn't know what the new old order was 10 years ago.
[01:15:21.537 --> 01:15:22.197]  Most of them do now.
[01:15:22.898 --> 01:15:25.298]  And the general public isn't as dumbed down as the new old order would like.
[01:15:25.978 --> 01:15:27.098]  And so it's a process.
[01:15:27.419 --> 01:15:28.599]  And that's why they're scared now.
[01:15:29.319 --> 01:15:30.579]  And Ron Paul's an indicator of that.
[01:15:30.879 --> 01:15:38.581]  We're going to come back, take a blitz of phone calls, get into Ron Paul, the big controversy that Fox News tried to spin, and get into some more new old order quotes.
[01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:39.361]  Stay with us.
[01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:42.612]  Oh, yeah!
[01:15:54.355 --> 01:15:58.479]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:15:58.719 --> 01:16:00.481]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:16:00.741 --> 01:16:07.027]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:16:07.327 --> 01:16:13.453]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:16:13.693 --> 01:16:15.535]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument.
[01:16:15.555 --> 01:16:15.735]  I think?
[01:16:32.245 --> 01:16:34.106]  Using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:16:34.286 --> 01:16:36.826]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:16:36.946 --> 01:16:38.027]  Don't just treat symptoms.

[01:18:55.124 --> 01:19:00.806]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally, without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[01:19:01.286 --> 01:19:03.427]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[01:19:03.607 --> 01:19:14.350]  These toxins enter our bodies, and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body, with more than 500 vital functions.

[01:20:06.075 --> 01:20:09.157]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[01:20:09.938 --> 01:20:12.119]  You're locked in to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:14.982]  Alright, here's the deal.
[01:20:15.202 --> 01:20:16.102]  I want to get into the economy.
[01:20:16.122 --> 01:20:18.464]  I want to get into Ron Paul and some of the new developments there.
[01:20:18.864 --> 01:20:21.386]  Both on the economy and Fox News and what they're trying to spin.
[01:20:21.626 --> 01:20:25.850]  What he actually said on my show Thursday was on Fox and CNN and Drudge in the last three days.
[01:20:27.171 --> 01:20:31.554]  But right now, let's go ahead and blast through your phone calls here.
[01:20:32.598 --> 01:20:36.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ruben in Pasadena.
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:37.480]  You're on the air.
[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:38.200]  Thanks for holding.
[01:20:38.881 --> 01:20:39.501]  Hi, Alex.
[01:20:40.101 --> 01:20:40.401]  Hello.
[01:20:40.721 --> 01:20:44.443]  Hey, Alex, easy on the criticism on the Christians.
[01:20:44.463 --> 01:20:46.644]  You know, there's a lot of us on your side.
[01:20:47.264 --> 01:20:50.365]  You have some friends that are Christians, like Tex Morris.
[01:20:50.385 --> 01:20:51.906]  I mean, what do you mean, Christians?
[01:20:51.966 --> 01:20:52.606]  I'm a Christian.
[01:20:53.286 --> 01:20:58.008]  I'm saying mainline Christians that don't even follow the Bible.
[01:20:58.553 --> 01:21:01.595]  But see, once this theological stuff starts, man, that's all that happens.
[01:21:01.976 --> 01:21:05.218]  It's a million denominations all fighting with each other, that's all I'm saying.
[01:21:05.958 --> 01:21:12.423]  Yes, well, it's sad, but that's just the nature.
[01:21:13.564 --> 01:21:24.472]  You know, Alex, one of the, what you're talking about, eugenics, Edwin Black wrote a very interesting book called War Against the Weak, and it chronicles very much what you're saying.
[01:21:24.612 --> 01:21:26.153]  IBM and the Nazis, everything.
[01:21:26.193 --> 01:21:27.334]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:21:28.181 --> 01:21:41.787]  I think the key to understand history, even present history, is to understand the dialectical system, which basically says the conflict is necessary to bring about change, desired change.
[01:21:42.748 --> 01:21:48.390]  Could it be possible that every major event in this administration was met with incompetence?
[01:21:48.930 --> 01:21:51.171]  Of course, incompetence is the preferred explanation.
[01:21:52.850 --> 01:21:57.732]  We can recall 9-11, the weapons of mass destruction, yellow cake uranium.
[01:21:58.272 --> 01:21:59.233]  No, no, I agree.
[01:22:00.193 --> 01:22:01.814]  In fact, I said before the war.
[01:22:02.074 --> 01:22:04.095]  They're all archived in my radio shows.
[01:22:05.916 --> 01:22:08.457]  You can find them back until about 2000 on the web.
[01:22:08.557 --> 01:22:16.180]  They're all over the place, but people have been putting them on websites religiously at least for the last five years, but you can find them all.
[01:22:17.241 --> 01:22:21.703]  And right before the war, longer than that, a year before the war, I said
[01:22:22.535 --> 01:22:24.236]  They're going to break Iraq in three pieces.
[01:22:25.396 --> 01:22:26.997]  They're not going to find WMDs.
[01:22:27.577 --> 01:22:28.057]  The U.S.
[01:22:28.077 --> 01:22:31.418]  will fall into a deep quagmire, which they want to then be able to stay there.
[01:22:31.959 --> 01:22:37.020]  Europe will pose and start plunging the dollar and say that, poses the good guy, and say the U.S.
[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:40.642]  is bad when the same people own both continents and it's the same elite together.
[01:22:41.282 --> 01:22:44.043]  And then we will be demonized worldwide and lose our good name.
[01:22:45.063 --> 01:22:46.424]  We're playing the bad cop right now.
[01:22:47.191 --> 01:22:49.032]  And that indeed has happened, yes.
[01:22:49.512 --> 01:22:50.132]  How did I know that?
[01:22:50.312 --> 01:22:54.053]  The globalists wrote about it in think tanks, again, just like they laugh about everything else.
[01:22:54.734 --> 01:23:05.817]  They said exactly what they would do, and how they were going to use this war to destroy our name worldwide, while they destroyed our borders with the Amnesty and the North American Union, and handed over our infrastructure to foreign companies.
[01:23:06.798 --> 01:23:07.358]  And now I've done it.
[01:23:08.999 --> 01:23:17.087]  Now, we're fighting them and they're a little bit behind, but we just can't get the general dumb public, you know, they're too busy acting like good old boys and feeling powerful, you know, to get involved and save this country.
[01:23:17.568 --> 01:23:17.968]  That's fine.
[01:23:17.988 --> 01:23:19.170]  Their dollar will be devalued.
[01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:20.391]  That was everything they got, probably.
[01:23:21.232 --> 01:23:21.452]  All right.
[01:23:21.492 --> 01:23:21.952]  You've been warned.
[01:23:21.972 --> 01:23:22.673]  Don't say you haven't been.
[01:23:23.214 --> 01:23:23.774]  Thank you, caller.
[01:23:23.794 --> 01:23:25.776]  Really good points that you just made here.
[01:23:26.517 --> 01:23:31.102]  Now, let's go ahead and talk to Patrick in Austin.
[01:23:31.422 --> 01:23:31.923]  You're on the air.
[01:23:31.983 --> 01:23:32.263]  Go ahead.
[01:23:32.853 --> 01:23:34.314]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:23:34.534 --> 01:23:35.134]  Enjoy the show.
[01:23:35.195 --> 01:23:53.466]  I just wanted to say, I think one of the major threats with the dumbed-down public is that while we chase these fake terrorism alerts and, you know, have Arab boogeymen all over the planet, there is a true threat of the Middle Eastern leaders, ironically a lot of them in Saudi Arabia, who are strict Islamics who
[01:23:54.073 --> 01:23:55.033]  I feel that the U.S.
[01:23:55.153 --> 01:23:58.274]  is evil, who can link up with China and some of these real threats.
[01:23:58.475 --> 01:23:59.315]  They've already linked up.
[01:23:59.375 --> 01:24:03.636]  Our little buddy Israel publicly gets all of our secrets and hands it over to China.
[01:24:04.617 --> 01:24:10.019]  My question is, why is Israel doing that when China's teamed up with Iran?
[01:24:10.059 --> 01:24:10.759]  I mean, that's what I mean.
[01:24:10.819 --> 01:24:11.399]  It's nuts!
[01:24:12.039 --> 01:24:19.262]  Well, they're worried about these guys who are, you know, kids falling rocks, and I believe that these terrorist organizations are
[01:24:23.674 --> 01:24:25.915]  Well, that's what the Pentagon said.
[01:24:25.935 --> 01:24:31.477]  They said, we don't have any real terrorists to have a big defense budget for the contractors that own and run us.
[01:24:31.658 --> 01:24:32.518]  And they said this.
[01:24:33.098 --> 01:24:37.320]  So they said, once we invade Iraq, it'll also create real terrorists, which is real good.
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:39.481]  Then we'll have an excuse to widen the operation.
[01:24:39.781 --> 01:24:44.904]  UPIAP, Google Pentagon Plan P2OG.
[01:24:44.964 --> 01:24:45.224]  Go ahead.
[01:24:45.942 --> 01:24:51.234]  Well, it's just that these people are all watching television and just totally brain dead and if they read up on...
[01:24:51.932 --> 01:25:00.014]  You know, how China controls the Panama Canal and... Again, given to them... I agree, given to them, and you're all great callers.
[01:25:00.034 --> 01:25:01.114]  I wish I could have you on for hours.
[01:25:01.174 --> 01:25:02.194]  I hate hanging up on good callers.
[01:25:02.214 --> 01:25:03.054]  I gotta go to the next person.
[01:25:03.334 --> 01:25:06.095]  I wish I could spend an hour about the history of the Panama Canal.
[01:25:06.615 --> 01:25:07.515]  1979, handed over by Carter.
[01:25:07.875 --> 01:25:10.496]  Built by the United States at the cost of thousands of U.S.
[01:25:10.556 --> 01:25:12.596]  lives of malaria and landslides.
[01:25:12.616 --> 01:25:14.297]  The French only built about 10% of it.
[01:25:14.637 --> 01:25:15.157]  It failed.
[01:25:15.177 --> 01:25:16.317]  We built the rest of it.
[01:25:16.897 --> 01:25:19.638]  And then it's just handed over to China.
[01:25:20.646 --> 01:25:21.628]  Can you believe it?
[01:25:28.783 --> 01:25:29.523]  San Diego.
[01:25:29.543 --> 01:25:34.686]  I mean, you think it's bad that the Arabs were going to get 21 ports, and it wasn't six, it was 21.
[01:25:34.786 --> 01:25:36.107]  By the way, they still got them.
[01:25:36.447 --> 01:25:41.389]  Halliburton was the front, and then they still handed it over, and then Halliburton moved to Dubai, now as an Arab company.
[01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:43.990]  But they'll still get no-bid contracts.
[01:25:44.411 --> 01:25:46.892]  I mean, it is a total sellout, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:47.292 --> 01:25:48.453]  No, no, China's the model.
[01:25:48.493 --> 01:25:49.513]  They say the U.S.
[01:25:50.013 --> 01:25:56.777]  is going to be third-world status as early as five years from now, and then they may bring us down to absolute degradation level.
[01:25:56.837 --> 01:25:57.457]  It's all official.
[01:25:58.144 --> 01:26:08.213]  And it's all official, and it's all in policy reports, and China is the model, because they have euthanasia, they have one-child policy, they have millions of people that are slaves, and they're the future.
[01:26:08.233 --> 01:26:08.794]  We're not, folks.
[01:26:09.514 --> 01:26:12.737]  Alrighty, let's go ahead and talk to Cornwall, England.
[01:26:12.877 --> 01:26:14.479]  I hope Joe hasn't been holding too long.
[01:26:14.539 --> 01:26:15.039]  Oh, he has.
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:16.641]  Over ten minutes.
[01:26:16.661 --> 01:26:17.101]  I'm sorry, Joe.
[01:26:17.141 --> 01:26:18.983]  I didn't know you were calling on your own dime.
[01:26:19.003 --> 01:26:19.843]  I would have gone to you earlier.
[01:26:20.644 --> 01:26:21.265]  Go ahead, Joe.
[01:26:21.305 --> 01:26:21.925]  You're on the air.
[01:26:21.965 --> 01:26:22.245]  Welcome.
[01:26:22.986 --> 01:26:24.307]  Hey, it's not a problem holding on.
[01:26:24.367 --> 01:26:24.948]  I'm on Skype.
[01:26:25.541 --> 01:26:28.343]  Okay, so you're a yank over in redcoat land.
[01:26:28.923 --> 01:26:29.484]  There you go.
[01:26:29.724 --> 01:26:30.504]  I love the redcoats.
[01:26:30.524 --> 01:26:30.865]  Go ahead.
[01:26:31.865 --> 01:26:33.586]  I have a question about the Federal Reserve.
[01:26:34.047 --> 01:26:34.847]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:26:35.348 --> 01:26:38.790]  Whether or not there's a possibility to invest in the companies that own it.
[01:26:39.170 --> 01:26:40.091]  I'll give you an example.
[01:26:40.591 --> 01:26:44.053]  I bought Centros when they got exported.
[01:26:44.073 --> 01:26:44.874]  Spanish company, yeah.
[01:26:45.714 --> 01:26:49.437]  And I have made 25% on my investment since last November.
[01:26:51.318 --> 01:26:54.260]  It became apparent that Perry was going to win here in Texas.
[01:26:54.659 --> 01:26:59.788]  The stock went up, and they declared a dividend, one for one, so you could buy more shares.
[01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:02.213]  So I'm wondering... Yeah, let's be clear.
[01:27:02.333 --> 01:27:03.876]  Sintra has paid nothing.
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:09.203]  Okay, and they're being handed the entire infrastructure, many of the roads.
[01:27:09.563 --> 01:27:11.685]  They don't build roads, they just place toll roads on it.
[01:27:11.925 --> 01:27:14.666]  The state builds new ones, fits the bill, they take it over.
[01:27:15.547 --> 01:27:18.869]  Perry, of course, total sellout to these people.
[01:27:18.889 --> 01:27:20.830]  It's happening nationwide, though worldwide for that matter.
[01:27:21.291 --> 01:27:23.592]  You know, I'm not going to tell you morally what you should do.
[01:27:23.612 --> 01:27:32.778]  I mean, the globalists already own over 90% of the global economy, so it's almost impossible to have a job anywhere or use anything or be involved in anything
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:40.101]  That doesn't have globalist tendrils into it.
[01:27:41.521 --> 01:27:42.842]  Here's my point, Alex.
[01:27:42.862 --> 01:27:43.802]  I agree with you.
[01:27:43.882 --> 01:27:44.642]  I understand that.
[01:27:44.982 --> 01:27:47.983]  So I turned it around and put it against them.
[01:27:48.183 --> 01:27:51.803]  I bought the shares at $13 a share at close Friday at $16.36.
[01:27:52.163 --> 01:27:51.803]  25%.
[01:27:54.624 --> 01:27:57.404]  I'm getting my money back from them.
[01:27:58.024 --> 01:28:01.305]  I will never ride on a toll roll if I can possibly avoid it here in Texas.
[01:28:01.738 --> 01:28:04.200]  But I'm making money on their backs.
[01:28:05.641 --> 01:28:07.283]  They think they're taking the money away from us.
[01:28:07.343 --> 01:28:09.585]  I found a way to invest and take money back from them.
[01:28:10.085 --> 01:28:17.071]  Well, there are a few sure investments out there, and if I had time to worry about them, I would be out there making a lot of money on it.
[01:28:18.712 --> 01:28:21.434]  I mean, I joked about three weeks ago, and it wasn't a hard call.
[01:28:21.515 --> 01:28:22.896]  I said, buy stock in Apple.
[01:28:24.277 --> 01:28:29.201]  Its stock went up 44% in one day, and it's still up 30-something percent last time I checked.
[01:28:29.935 --> 01:28:36.700]  But folks, I'm so busy making films and stuff trying to warn you, and then putting them out for free on Google, that I don't have time to go around buying stock.
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:38.221]  I mean, absolutely.
[01:28:40.102 --> 01:28:44.546]  In the 1980s, early 1990s, all the Cold Wars were over.
[01:28:44.806 --> 01:28:45.666]  We're out of Iraq.
[01:28:45.706 --> 01:28:48.529]  Defense stocks went down to about 5 cents on average.
[01:28:49.659 --> 01:28:53.361]  Some of them as low as one cent from what they were worth before.
[01:28:53.401 --> 01:28:55.282]  That was all done as a big joke by the globalists.
[01:28:55.662 --> 01:29:01.145]  Everybody divested and then they went in and bought them all up and even centralized it greater and they doubled, quadrupled after that.
[01:29:02.566 --> 01:29:04.427]  I mean, obviously, yes.
[01:29:04.707 --> 01:29:06.788]  But the problem is they can pull an Enron on you.
[01:29:06.848 --> 01:29:10.509]  I mean, I didn't know anything about energy stocks six, seven years ago.
[01:29:10.809 --> 01:29:13.310]  And I saw this weird movement in Enron, because I'm right here in Texas.
[01:29:13.771 --> 01:29:16.412]  And I told folks, I said, this company is a big scam.
[01:29:16.952 --> 01:29:19.333]  I noticed it had all these globalists on its board, and I said, get out of it.
[01:29:19.873 --> 01:29:22.794]  And I had all these local yuppies laugh at me.
[01:29:22.814 --> 01:29:23.314]  It's fine.
[01:29:23.394 --> 01:29:24.255]  Just do what you want.
[01:29:24.775 --> 01:29:31.858]  I mean, if you don't know to get out of Enron two years before it fell, and you don't know to buy Apple before iPhone comes out, I mean, I just can't.
[01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:34.711]  You can't make a horse drink, folks.
[01:29:34.731 --> 01:29:35.411]  You can leave him to water.
[01:29:35.952 --> 01:29:38.073]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com are the websites.
[01:29:38.193 --> 01:29:42.595]  I'm going to come back, get this Ron Paul news, play a few clips, and if we have time, get to Robert and Rick and others.
[01:29:42.935 --> 01:29:43.736]  I'll definitely get to Rick.
[01:29:43.756 --> 01:29:44.056]  Stay there.
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:59.604]  You want to lose weight, but there's no way you want to resort to pills or shakes that are full of chemicals or drugs with harmful side effects.
[01:30:00.091 --> 01:30:01.392]  We know diets don't work.
[01:30:01.672 --> 01:30:03.533]  That's why there's the Fat Loss Patch.
[01:30:03.713 --> 01:30:10.736]  The Fat Loss Patch is a self-adhesive dietary aid worn daily that slowly releases all natural ingredients into the skin.
[01:30:10.936 --> 01:30:21.581]  The result is a safe and easy way for you to increase your energy levels, maintain a healthy body weight, incur those horrible sugar cravings, all without irritating side effects or loss of muscle.
[01:30:21.781 --> 01:30:24.703]  Just peel it off, stick it on, and live your life.
[01:30:25.163 --> 01:30:28.004]  The Patch is safe, effective, and clinically tested.
[01:30:28.164 --> 01:30:33.005]  Also, the Fat Loss Patch is the most unique product and business opportunity to ever hit the U.S.
[01:30:33.145 --> 01:30:34.286]  and international markets.
[01:30:34.766 --> 01:30:35.686]  Join as a U.S.
[01:30:35.786 --> 01:30:40.148]  or European customer or distributor in this much-needed and fast-growing business.
[01:30:40.448 --> 01:30:44.509]  For more information, visit PatchMeeting.com or call Judy at 800-766-2133.
[01:30:44.589 --> 01:30:44.809]  That's 800-766-2133.
[01:30:55.797 --> 01:30:57.598]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[01:30:58.079 --> 01:30:59.860]  Sure, you've got a mortgage and credit cards.
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:03.303]  Your debt creation is probably the smartest thing you've ever done.
[01:31:03.763 --> 01:31:05.384]  How would it be to find $75,000, $150,000, $200,000 or more you never knew you had?
[01:31:08.749 --> 01:31:13.173]  Now the task force has strategies to make these debts into virtual savings accounts.
[01:31:13.733 --> 01:31:16.115]  Ben Franklin said, a penny saved is a penny earned.
[01:31:16.695 --> 01:31:25.142]  By doing nothing more than you're doing right now, because you've used your credit, the right strategies can make the debt part of your financial life the smartest thing you've ever done.
[01:31:25.682 --> 01:31:28.384]  Oh, by the way, your strategies cost you nothing out of pocket.
[01:31:29.045 --> 01:31:31.827]  Go ahead and check out the debt elimination scams if you'd like to.
[01:31:32.367 --> 01:31:36.811]  You wouldn't take money from a loan shark, so you may not want to give your money to a debt shark.

[01:32:54.652 --> 01:32:55.913]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:32:56.153 --> 01:32:58.974]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:32:59.335 --> 01:33:02.096]  What part of unconstitutional do not understand, George?
[01:33:02.636 --> 01:33:09.380]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:33:18.565 --> 01:33:18.966]  I think so.

[01:33:33.599 --> 01:33:33.980]  That's 877-873-9626.

[01:33:36.962 --> 01:33:37.222]  That's 877-873-9626.
[01:33:37.362 --> 01:33:38.343]  You're listening to GCN.
[01:33:38.363 --> 01:33:40.264]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:34:02.819 --> 01:34:05.300]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:34:08.001 --> 01:34:09.081]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:10.482 --> 01:34:14.984]  Really, what the elite talk most about is how they get you wedded to an idea.
[01:34:15.344 --> 01:34:21.726]  They get you to believe the war is against the people of Al-Qaeda and that we're saving America, when really you're destroying America.
[01:34:21.746 --> 01:34:29.749]  And it doesn't matter if they even openly later admit that they conned you, you don't want to admit you've been scammed and so you'll never wake up.
[01:34:31.698 --> 01:34:37.322]  Just type new old order quotes into Google and just go read what the elite have to say about you.
[01:34:39.943 --> 01:34:41.925]  And then you can link through and even find the sources.
[01:34:42.245 --> 01:34:42.885]  I mean, do what I do.
[01:34:42.905 --> 01:34:46.447]  When you read a source, a book or a news article where it was said, go to the library.
[01:34:47.188 --> 01:34:48.689]  Or order the book online.
[01:34:49.389 --> 01:34:55.093]  And then have it come to you in the mail and open it up where they actually read and call you slaves and say they want to kill you and your family.
[01:34:56.314 --> 01:34:58.595]  I mean, when I read this stuff online, I didn't believe it years ago.
[01:34:58.655 --> 01:35:03.657]  I would order the book and it would come in the mail and there would be the world leader saying that we're a bunch of scum and a bunch of slaves.
[01:35:04.458 --> 01:35:06.318]  And I mean, I don't know why you want to put up with these people.
[01:35:06.358 --> 01:35:07.299]  They're not all powerful.
[01:35:07.319 --> 01:35:08.319]  They're not omnipresent.
[01:35:08.759 --> 01:35:12.401]  They picked up social Darwinism saying, hey, the elite have a right to rule.
[01:35:12.421 --> 01:35:13.882]  We have a right to be as mean as we want.
[01:35:14.302 --> 01:35:15.422]  It only helps humanity.
[01:35:16.483 --> 01:35:21.165]  And then once they went past the point of saying there's no sanctity of life, they could kill whoever they wanted to.
[01:35:22.825 --> 01:35:24.246]  They think it's a good thing they're doing.
[01:35:25.859 --> 01:35:29.382]  Now as for Ron Paul, I interviewed him Thursday.
[01:35:29.422 --> 01:35:30.563]  Here's a little clip of it.
[01:35:31.464 --> 01:35:32.785]  And this is what he had to say.
[01:35:34.827 --> 01:35:35.648]  This is Ron Paul.
[01:35:37.163 --> 01:35:37.523]  Thursday.
[01:35:37.864 --> 01:35:47.390]  Congressman, just out of the gate, Cindy Sheehan yesterday on my show, and further than anybody's ever gone, she said, distinct chance of staged terror attack, or the government allowing that to happen.
[01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:50.752]  Bush is saying he doesn't care what the people want, the war will continue.
[01:35:51.112 --> 01:35:59.838]  They've set up the Military Commissions Act, they've set up the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, he signed PDD 51, making himself literally dictator.
[01:36:01.199 --> 01:36:02.820]  He quote, gave himself that power.
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:07.765]  How much danger are we in now with the Homeland Security head feeling in his gut we're about to be hit?
[01:36:07.985 --> 01:36:13.850]  Republican memos saying they need terror attacks, they need Al-Qaeda to hit us to be able to continue the war.
[01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:16.233]  Top military strategists saying it.
[01:36:16.773 --> 01:36:20.457]  How much danger are we in of some new Gulf of Tonkin provocation?
[01:36:21.383 --> 01:36:22.923]  I think we're in great danger of it.
[01:36:22.963 --> 01:36:24.344]  We're in danger in many ways.
[01:36:24.384 --> 01:36:34.006]  The attack on our civil liberties here at home, the foreign policy that's in shambles, and our obligations overseas and commitment which endangers our troops and our national defense.
[01:36:35.047 --> 01:36:39.568]  So every day we're in worse shape and right now there's an orchestrated
[01:36:40.328 --> 01:36:43.089]  We're in a much greater danger than we've been even four or five years ago.
[01:37:03.650 --> 01:37:07.413]  And you can hear the whole 20 minute interview, it got picked up on Drudge and everywhere else.
[01:37:07.453 --> 01:37:15.438]  Now Fox had a ticker going, they played clips, and then said, Ron Paul believes the government may stage a terror attack.
[01:37:16.859 --> 01:37:22.963]  No, our headline was that Ron Paul believes there could be a massive staged terror provocation.
[01:37:23.824 --> 01:37:25.945]  And Gulf of Tonkin, they steamed our ships in there in 64.
[01:37:28.374 --> 01:37:33.738]  And the Vietnamese were smart enough not to fire on them, and then our government just claimed that we did.
[01:37:34.078 --> 01:37:36.799]  And those LBJ tapes have been released where him and McNamara are staging it.
[01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:43.544]  Now, Ron Paul had been on my show before and talked, without me prompting him, I think about a year ago.
[01:37:44.444 --> 01:37:48.747]  We pulled up the article about how they could stage a Gulf of Tonkin event.
[01:37:49.167 --> 01:37:52.169]  He also gave a speech in January of this year, saying out on the floor of the House.
[01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:53.930]  That's why I raised that question.
[01:37:54.190 --> 01:37:56.632]  And that's what we specifically talked about was the Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:37:57.285 --> 01:38:04.650]  And Fox tried to spin that, and then some of the little libertarian groups and other people who basically don't believe there's a new world order or any corruption.
[01:38:05.650 --> 01:38:08.132]  They've tried to even attack me and say, oh, Ron Paul didn't say that.
[01:38:08.892 --> 01:38:10.113]  He didn't even say Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:38:10.854 --> 01:38:15.056]  Yes, he did, and here's Ron Paul talking about the Gulf of Tonkin on January 7th of 2007.
[01:38:15.277 --> 01:38:15.957]  Here it is.
[01:38:18.439 --> 01:38:25.303]  Our inability to adapt to the tactics of fourth generation warfare compounds our military failure.
[01:38:26.639 --> 01:38:33.468]  Unless we understand this, even doubling our troop strength will not solve the problems created by our occupation.
[01:38:34.369 --> 01:38:42.419]  The talk of a troop surge and jobs program in Iraq only distracts Americans from the very real possibility of an attack on Iran.
[01:38:43.863 --> 01:38:48.866]  Our growing naval presence in the region and our harsh rhetoric toward Iran are unsettling.
[01:38:49.706 --> 01:38:57.350]  Securing the Horn of Africa and sending Ethiopian troops into Somalia do not bode well for world peace.
[01:38:57.990 --> 01:39:02.072]  Yet these developments are almost totally ignored by Congress.
[01:39:03.873 --> 01:39:10.077]  Rumors are flying about when, not if, Iran will be bombed by either Israel or the United States.
[01:39:10.377 --> 01:39:12.718]  Possibly with nuclear weapons.
[01:39:13.679 --> 01:39:20.745]  Our CIA says Iran is 10 years away from producing a nuclear bomb and has no delivery system.
[01:39:21.166 --> 01:39:26.530]  But this does not impede our plans to keep everything on the table when dealing with Iran.
[01:39:27.411 --> 01:39:32.716]  We should remember that Iran, like Iraq, is a third world nation without a significant military.
[01:39:33.396 --> 01:39:40.983]  Nothing in history hints that she is likely to invade a neighboring country, let alone do anything to America or Israel.
[01:39:41.861 --> 01:39:50.830]  I am concerned, however, that a contrived Gulf of Punkin-type incident may well occur to gain popular support for an attack on Iran.
[01:39:51.671 --> 01:39:55.135]  Even if such an attack is carried out by Israel over U.S.
[01:39:55.215 --> 01:40:03.003]  objections, we will be politically and morally culpable since we provided the weapons and the dollars to make it possible.
[01:40:04.056 --> 01:40:06.557]  Now, he's said a lot more on my show.
[01:40:06.577 --> 01:40:08.138]  He's said several times in the past.
[01:40:08.158 --> 01:40:09.859]  In fact, we're going to dig these up tomorrow.
[01:40:09.879 --> 01:40:14.881]  A couple of my best writers were off this weekend, and I've already instructed them.
[01:40:15.001 --> 01:40:22.364]  I want all the articles, all the clips dug out, were on my show in the past five, six years.
[01:40:22.424 --> 01:40:29.287]  He's talked about stage provocations, staged events, staged terror, and we're going to stick it down the throats of everybody, as usual.
[01:40:32.202 --> 01:40:36.448]  It is a contrivance to say that he's a 9-11 truther, and we have not said that.
[01:40:37.589 --> 01:40:43.076]  Now, I've got hundreds of pages here of New World Order quotes, and these are bibliographed.
[01:40:43.096 --> 01:40:44.899]  You can go get these for yourself.
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:47.282]  And there's just hundreds of them.
[01:40:49.845 --> 01:40:50.566]  There's hundreds of them.
[01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:56.393]  The world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.
[01:40:56.774 --> 01:40:58.535]  Prime Minister Benjamin Dressel of England.
[01:40:58.935 --> 01:41:06.320]  The Council on Foreign Relations is the American branch of the Society which originated in England and believes national boundaries should be obliterated for a one world rule established.
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:10.682]  Professor of History, Carol Quigley, Georgetown University, in his book, Tragedy and Hope, Bill Clinton's mentor.
[01:41:11.123 --> 01:41:11.803]  Woodrow Wilson.
[01:41:12.557 --> 01:41:14.198]  The New World Order cannot happen unless U.S.
[01:41:14.218 --> 01:41:14.658]  participation
[01:41:34.944 --> 01:41:36.986]  As we are the most significant single component.
[01:41:37.046 --> 01:41:40.668]  Yes, there will be a new world order, and it will force the United States to change its perceptions.
[01:41:41.008 --> 01:41:47.233]  Henry Kissinger, World Affairs Council Press Conference, Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, April 19th, 1994.
[01:41:47.413 --> 01:41:48.714]  These are public statements.
[01:41:49.214 --> 01:41:50.615]  I mean, I've got hundreds of them, folks.
[01:41:50.996 --> 01:41:56.900]  Let me see, there's like ten a page, and I've got... sixty-something pages of these.
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:02.724]  I don't know, hundreds and hundreds of... I mean, you can... And I mean, there's quotes in here about how they're going to kill us.
[01:42:02.764 --> 01:42:03.845]  That's not the really bad ones.
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:08.662]  I mean, I read that quote earlier about how we're a bunch of sheep and animals, they're gonna get us, and we're dumb.
[01:42:08.902 --> 01:42:10.743]  Let's take a call from Rick in Salado.
[01:42:10.763 --> 01:42:13.224]  He's been holding too long for me not to get to him.
[01:42:13.624 --> 01:42:16.225]  You got about a minute or two, Rick, then we're gonna wrap this thing up.
[01:42:16.245 --> 01:42:16.565]  Go ahead.
[01:42:17.386 --> 01:42:18.166]  Hey, thank you.
[01:42:18.566 --> 01:42:19.126]  Go ahead.
[01:42:19.607 --> 01:42:22.388]  And thank you, KLBJ, for putting Alex Jones on the air.
[01:42:23.108 --> 01:42:26.830]  Anyway, I was stopped for a routine traffic stop.
[01:42:27.410 --> 01:42:29.451]  I supposedly ran a stop sign.
[01:42:29.931 --> 01:42:32.953]  And the first thing the police officer... Just tell them you're an illegal alien, they'll let you go.
[01:42:32.993 --> 01:42:33.493]  That's admitted.
[01:42:34.346 --> 01:42:40.469]  Anyway, the officer asked me, do you have any drugs, guns, or any other terrorist items?
[01:42:40.529 --> 01:42:42.610]  And he had a smirk on his face when he said it.
[01:42:42.690 --> 01:42:44.191]  Oh yeah, everything's terrorism now.
[01:42:44.211 --> 01:42:46.792]  In the Patriot Act, any misdemeanor is terrorism.
[01:42:46.832 --> 01:42:47.332]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:42:47.872 --> 01:42:48.953]  And I said, no.
[01:42:48.973 --> 01:42:50.794]  And he said, do you mind if I have a look?
[01:42:51.474 --> 01:42:55.496]  And I have hair down to my shoulders, and I'm a musician.
[01:42:56.343 --> 01:43:02.928]  And I figured, you know, I like to play rock and roll, and I figured he just thought maybe I had some drugs or something, and so I just let him search.
[01:43:02.968 --> 01:43:03.968]  No, that's always worse.
[01:43:04.088 --> 01:43:10.333]  Even if you had something, sir, or if they planted it on you, which some do, then they couldn't send you to prison because they didn't have a warrant to do it.
[01:43:10.693 --> 01:43:13.855]  When you allow them to do that, you allow them to stab America directly in the heart.
[01:43:14.295 --> 01:43:17.197]  Now, again, type into Google, police... I wish I hadn't.
[01:43:17.597 --> 01:43:19.218]  Listen, I wish you wouldn't have had that.
[01:43:19.259 --> 01:43:20.980]  I bet something bad happened to you, but we're out of time.
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:24.302]  You can call me back here in the week or next Sunday if you want to finish your story, sir.
[01:43:25.474 --> 01:43:28.837]  But I heard you say you wish you hadn't.
[01:43:28.857 --> 01:43:32.680]  I was looking at the clock wrong.
[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:33.721]  He doesn't have time to call back.
[01:43:33.761 --> 01:43:34.761]  I wanted to hear the other story too.
[01:43:34.781 --> 01:43:35.842]  I don't know why I just hung up on him.
[01:43:36.382 --> 01:43:39.985]  It's just irritating to hear that you said, oh yeah, I'll let you search the car.
[01:43:40.265 --> 01:43:41.847]  See, you thought you'd be reasonable.
[01:43:42.207 --> 01:43:43.428]  You thought you'd be nice.
[01:43:43.468 --> 01:43:46.150]  See, I tell you, you've been conditioned from being as a child.
[01:43:47.591 --> 01:43:49.052]  He's there attacking America.
[01:43:50.012 --> 01:43:50.953]  To look for drugs.
[01:43:50.993 --> 01:43:51.653]  You pull you over.
[01:43:51.993 --> 01:43:53.454]  Mind if I randomly search?
[01:43:53.835 --> 01:44:07.203]  But it's in the newspapers that the illegal aliens... I see it every week, mainstream news, where the cops... I've got the mayor of one of the towns outside San Diego being griped at at a meeting by a bunch of illegal aliens.
[01:44:07.243 --> 01:44:10.405]  And he goes, well listen, the cops already told not to arrest you on your DWI.
[01:44:10.626 --> 01:44:11.586]  We let you do whatever you want.
[01:44:11.606 --> 01:44:12.427]  Why are you mad at me?
[01:44:14.728 --> 01:44:17.789]  I mean, I've had Austin cops tell me, they're told, don't arrest illegal aliens.
[01:44:18.249 --> 01:44:21.210]  For like, driver's license, and you know, or a few beers.
[01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:24.131]  But citizens, they throw the book at you, because we're the schmucks, folks.
[01:44:24.451 --> 01:44:25.251]  We're the target.
[01:44:25.491 --> 01:44:26.832]  Everybody knows we're the pushover.
[01:44:26.892 --> 01:44:33.834]  Because we think we're free, we're dumbed down, we're overweight, waddling around, just saying we're God, and we're not!
[01:44:34.094 --> 01:44:35.435]  We're not copper little people.
[01:44:35.715 --> 01:44:37.176]  Land of the coward, home of the slaves.
[01:44:37.436 --> 01:44:38.196]  God bless you all.
[01:44:42.466 --> 01:44:43.646]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:44:43.746 --> 01:44:48.567]  Over the years, Genesis Communications Network has grown by leaps and bounds, reaching millions of listeners.
[01:44:48.667 --> 01:44:51.548]  The impact on political and social issues have been enormous.
[01:44:51.708 --> 01:44:55.709]  Businesses associated with the network have grown to become valuable enterprises.
[01:44:56.029 --> 01:45:02.031]  If you are accredited and have an entrepreneurial spirit, national radio may be the opportunity you're looking for.
[01:45:02.211 --> 01:45:03.451]  Call me today at 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[01:45:03.491 --> 01:45:04.871]  For more information, that's 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[01:45:13.614 --> 01:45:14.614]  Looking for profits?
[01:45:14.694 --> 01:45:16.095]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:45:16.415 --> 01:45:19.636]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:45:19.656 --> 01:45:27.239]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[01:45:27.279 --> 01:45:30.701]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:45:30.781 --> 01:45:32.561]  Secure your position today.
[01:45:32.862 --> 01:45:34.102]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:45:34.122 --> 01:45:34.382]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
