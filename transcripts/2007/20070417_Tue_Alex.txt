[00:00:06.992 --> 00:00:07.672]  Big Brother.
[00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:09.393]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:10.073 --> 00:00:11.213]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.853 --> 00:00:12.654]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:15.335]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:18.616]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:19.156 --> 00:00:23.258]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.418 --> 00:00:34.940]  I had several guests lined up for the show today, and I've cancelled them.
[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.860]  They were lined up a few days ago.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:47.645]  Because I want to give you a chance to respond to the world news, the plunge of the dollar, what's happening with the stock market, what's happening with the build-up for war with Iran.
[00:00:48.445 --> 00:00:57.869]  Of course, the college shooting, the victim disarmament display of domestication and cowardice by the police and everyone else involved.
[00:00:59.613 --> 00:01:11.956]  The new horrible global drumbeat for victim disarmament and all the evidence does point towards some type of at least provocateur or black-op situation.
[00:01:12.636 --> 00:01:19.478]  With this, the total free number to join us on air and then we'll talk about any issue you want but obviously you're gonna want to be talking about the shooting.
[00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:22.319]  We will take a lot of your calls for the full three hours.
[00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:22.359]  1-800
[00:01:25.307 --> 00:01:25.948]  2-5-9-92-31-1-800-2-5-9-9-2-3-1.
[00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:34.354]  We need to get out ahead of the gun grabber propaganda.
[00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:39.719]  Paul Watson and Gunners of America and others have written excellent articles.
[00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:42.321]  I've contributed to, of course, the Prison Planet article.
[00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:44.582]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:45.343 --> 00:01:50.827]  You better fight for the Second Amendment's life and get up there and get those articles because they're hardcore.
[00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:51.848]  They spell out the facts.
[00:01:53.684 --> 00:01:59.228]  I also have, what, the 14 myths of gun control here in front of me as well.
[00:01:59.268 --> 00:02:00.148]  I want to go over those.
[00:02:00.168 --> 00:02:03.430]  You need to get them out to everybody.
[00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.871]  In fact, I'm on my MySpace account.
[00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:05.552]  Somebody posted those.
[00:02:05.572 --> 00:02:06.372]  They're pretty good.
[00:02:07.973 --> 00:02:10.615]  It's MySpace slash, I think, Infowarrior.
[00:02:10.635 --> 00:02:13.276]  There's a link to it up on Infowars.com if you can't find it.
[00:02:15.137 --> 00:02:19.000]  We better go on every message board, every mainstream message board, every MySpace account.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.761]  We better call into every talk radio show.
[00:02:21.613 --> 00:02:23.215]  Because I'm actually concerned.
[00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:25.016]  I think they're going in for the big one this time.
[00:02:26.117 --> 00:02:28.920]  I watched Fox News off and on for a couple hours yesterday.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.143]  I saw repeated calls for gun control on Fox.
[00:02:32.904 --> 00:02:34.385]  There was an FBI agent.
[00:02:35.306 --> 00:02:36.547]  Everybody was freaking out in the office.
[00:02:36.587 --> 00:02:37.148]  I walked in.
[00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:37.708]  I missed it.
[00:02:37.788 --> 00:02:38.789]  They all repeated that.
[00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.071]  They had an FBI agent on Wolf Blitzer.
[00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:41.732]  Did you see it?
[00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:48.016]  They would have re-aired Wolf Blitzer and I could have taped it, but it was live coverage into the wee hours, so they didn't re-air it.
[00:02:48.576 --> 00:02:52.377]  And the FBI agent was saying, well, we've got to give up our liberties now and get rid of the Second Amendment.
[00:02:52.997 --> 00:02:56.978]  And it was, ah, yes, just like with 9-11, we've got to get rid of the Bill of Rights now.
[00:02:57.018 --> 00:02:58.039]  The world has changed.
[00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:03.580]  It doesn't matter if many more people drowned or many more people died in automobile accidents.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.641]  It doesn't matter.
[00:03:04.821 --> 00:03:05.781]  They're going to hype this.
[00:03:06.624 --> 00:03:08.124]  They're going to milk it for everything it's worth.
[00:03:08.145 --> 00:03:09.245]  They're going to be copycats.
[00:03:09.545 --> 00:03:10.445]  They've shut down St.
[00:03:10.485 --> 00:03:12.446]  Edward's University, where my sister goes to college.
[00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:15.787]  She's 15 years younger than me, and she's already in college.
[00:03:17.047 --> 00:03:19.628]  And they've shut it down as a bomb threat.
[00:03:19.988 --> 00:03:21.149]  Copycats will call it in.
[00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:28.331]  You'll probably have real shooters now, but they won't be the government black-op type where they kill 35 people and injure another 20 or so.
[00:03:28.351 --> 00:03:29.971]  They'll be killed two or three a year.
[00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:32.832]  In fact, I would look for copycat shootings in the next week.
[00:03:33.993 --> 00:03:35.073]  There'll probably be three or four.
[00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.290]  And then in a month there'll be a bunch of copycat shootings.
[00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.510]  I mean, pretty much you can guarantee there'll be copycat shootings.
[00:03:43.011 --> 00:03:44.011]  Probably by the end of the day.
[00:03:44.711 --> 00:04:05.517]  It's... Americans have gone from being the most aggressive and the most intelligent people in the world, even foreign historians marveled at it, full of courage, full of vitality, electric in the eyes, electric sparks in the eyes, to... They lined up, just like at Columbine and everywhere else, and they let this piece of filth go down the line shooting them in the head.
[00:04:06.463 --> 00:04:09.225]  I mean, let me just give people, gun-wielding thugs, a little checklist.
[00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:11.766]  You pull on me and I'm not armed, I'm going to charge you.
[00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.028]  Or I'm going to, you know, try to jump through a window or run.
[00:04:15.048 --> 00:04:19.211]  I mean, I'll... But knowing the way I am, I'll just... I mean, I just can't help myself.
[00:04:19.911 --> 00:04:22.513]  You know, if something scares me, I immediately attack.
[00:04:22.573 --> 00:04:23.513]  It's almost a weakness.
[00:04:23.973 --> 00:04:25.114]  People know that's how I am.
[00:04:26.075 --> 00:04:34.760]  I had an individual close to me in my office, engaging in a bunch of stuff, and I'm going to have to sue him now and go after him.
[00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:37.677]  You know, that's just everything else.
[00:04:37.697 --> 00:04:38.758]  I mean, that's just who I am.
[00:04:38.818 --> 00:04:39.378]  It's what I am.
[00:04:39.418 --> 00:04:41.340]  You attack me, you will be attacked back.
[00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:46.365]  And I cannot believe that that's what's happened in this country.
[00:04:46.405 --> 00:04:47.386]  I'm going to go over all of it.
[00:04:47.646 --> 00:04:48.727]  We're going to take your calls.
[00:04:49.067 --> 00:04:49.968]  We're going to cover it all.
[00:04:50.268 --> 00:04:50.669]  Stay with us.
[00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:10.551]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:13.433]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:05:13.753 --> 00:05:22.019]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:05:22.359 --> 00:05:24.680]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:29.223]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:05:30.544 --> 00:05:32.165]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:05:32.545 --> 00:05:33.465]  Take action now!
[00:05:33.585 --> 00:05:34.506]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:05:38.388 --> 00:05:42.171]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:45.593]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:05:45.713 --> 00:05:52.177]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:05:52.458 --> 00:05:58.001]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:05:58.422 --> 00:06:00.523]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[00:06:00.743 --> 00:06:02.464]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:06:09.486 --> 00:06:13.988]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:14.328 --> 00:06:18.410]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.250]  We listened.
[00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.552]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:24.812 --> 00:06:25.292]  We listened.
[00:06:25.692 --> 00:06:28.714]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:29.175 --> 00:06:29.695]  We listened.
[00:06:30.155 --> 00:06:34.218]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:35.099]  We listened.
[00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:40.663]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:06:41.063 --> 00:06:42.444]  Again, we listened.
[00:06:42.805 --> 00:06:50.130]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.211]  Get the Berkey Lite at the American Water Purifier.
[00:06:53.411 --> 00:06:53.611]  Only $279.
[00:06:53.671 --> 00:06:54.252]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:54.292 --> 00:06:54.532]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:54.592 --> 00:06:56.212]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:06:56.252 --> 00:06:57.193]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:06.474 --> 00:07:10.537]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:07:10.737 --> 00:07:14.160]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.823]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:21.326]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:07:21.346 --> 00:07:26.810]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:33.956]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal form it's like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs.
[00:07:34.056 --> 00:07:36.457]  A few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:07:36.597 --> 00:07:37.878]  It's a well thought out formula.
[00:07:37.898 --> 00:07:43.420]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.322]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:49.743]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:07:49.923 --> 00:07:53.945]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:55.805]  That toll free number again?
[00:08:07.261 --> 00:08:07.921]  Big Brother.
[00:08:08.582 --> 00:08:09.662]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:10.343 --> 00:08:11.463]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:12.103 --> 00:08:12.924]  You want answers?
[00:08:13.684 --> 00:08:14.525]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:19.087]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.427 --> 00:08:23.549]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:42.885 --> 00:08:44.306]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:44.366 --> 00:08:45.046]  Welcome back.
[00:08:45.106 --> 00:08:50.387]  We are now into the first hour of this worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[00:08:51.247 --> 00:08:58.549]  Jeffrey, Skeo, Eric, Joe, Dave, everybody, we're going to be taking your calls throughout the broadcast at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:58.889 --> 00:09:03.230]  We'll get right into the shooting, the aftermath, the attack on the Second Amendment.
[00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:07.777]  Coming up, though, I've got to cover other news here, not just this one issue.
[00:09:08.598 --> 00:09:19.241]  They've now dropped, for now, the hearings against Alberto Gonzales, and it looks like this will now have that story received in the background, and he'll probably end up staying in power.
[00:09:20.442 --> 00:09:24.103]  Alberto, I love torture, Gonzales, Bush is above the law, Gonzales.
[00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:27.570]  Now it looks like it's going to skate free.
[00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.072]  Boy, I tell you, that shooting sure came at the right time, didn't it?
[00:09:30.412 --> 00:09:43.000]  With all the black-op drills and the loudspeakers just being put in, and two-plus hours before they put out the word that there'd been a shooting, and all the rest of it, and the cops sitting there for hours.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.921]  It's just the way it always works, isn't it?
[00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:51.945]  Right on time, coming up on the Columbine anniversary in a few days, coming up on the Waco anniversary and the Oklahoma City anniversary.
[00:09:54.364 --> 00:09:59.227]  And Rush Limbaugh has said, but we already know, that Hillary is going to be the next president.
[00:10:00.088 --> 00:10:05.091]  He said a quote, 80% chance that it's going to be Hillary as the next president.
[00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:12.236]  And he should know, his boss, who created him, Roger Ailes, the head of Fox News, is the chief strategist behind Hillary.
[00:10:12.916 --> 00:10:14.878]  And they've been having meetings secretly for four years.
[00:10:14.918 --> 00:10:16.719]  That came out in the New York Observer a couple years ago.
[00:10:17.598 --> 00:10:26.500]  And, uh, Rupert Murdoch is quietly behind her campaign, and you see the neocons only giving her attention, and now kind of puffing her up and pushing her and attacking the other Democrats.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:36.883]  So, the Clintons' vacation with the Bushes, folks, just like the Bushes' vacation with the Bin Ladens, in the words of FBI agent Robert Wright, as well as Judicial Watch head Larry Klinman.
[00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:45.185]  And, uh, Rush Limbaugh, the fake conservative, is there to give her the attention, and there to tell you that she's the woman.
[00:10:45.785 --> 00:10:46.865]  She's not the man, she's the woman.
[00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:49.883]  And, uh, we're in deep trouble.
[00:10:50.723 --> 00:10:51.983]  That's really all I can tell you.
[00:10:53.363 --> 00:11:13.489]  It doesn't matter if it's George Bush, Jeb Bush, it doesn't matter if it's, uh, any of these Rip, Mip, Romney, it doesn't matter if it's Barack Obama, it doesn't matter who it is, Newt Gingrich, it's just, they're all horrible, they're all elitists, they all work for the same people, and they all hang out together and go, and hang, and in the same golfing buddies, and they just laugh at us.
[00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:14.829]  It's a big, giant joke.
[00:11:16.417 --> 00:11:20.300]  And now the Republicans in Fox News and others are getting behind man-made global warming.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.802]  Newt Gingrich is supporting global taxation.
[00:11:23.202 --> 00:11:24.223]  Schwarzenegger is.
[00:11:24.423 --> 00:11:27.245]  It's just... It's total disaster.
[00:11:28.365 --> 00:11:29.606]  And they're making a move.
[00:11:29.626 --> 00:11:34.209]  You didn't just think we'd sit here... I just don't even know what to say anymore.
[00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:42.175]  You don't just think as a society we could just sit here and not be involved in politics and not be truly informed and live in a free society.
[00:11:43.448 --> 00:11:47.251]  So a British pound breaks through the $2 mark per pound.
[00:11:48.892 --> 00:11:54.696]  And the dollar is just continuing its spiral downward with inflation out of control and everything else.
[00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:57.998]  It's just absolutely horrible.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:10.047]  The Daily Texan reported on BYU physics professor that was at a UT event here over the weekend, Professor Stephen Jones.
[00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:32.018]  We've been so busy in the last two weeks since he broke the news here on this show about the particles he was able to get from Ground Zero remains that showed clear thermate residue in the little globules of melted steel that had turned into an alloy.
[00:12:35.001 --> 00:12:36.983]  And it's just unbelievable information.
[00:12:37.023 --> 00:12:42.367]  We haven't had time to write that article yet because they've been too busy writing three or four articles a piece a day on all the other breaking news.
[00:12:42.427 --> 00:12:46.910]  But somebody ought to go listen to that interview Stephen Jones did here two weeks ago.
[00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:53.235]  And because it's just more evidence of the thermate being used as one of the explosive elements.
[00:12:53.275 --> 00:12:54.696]  We're not saying that's all that was used.
[00:12:55.016 --> 00:13:00.440]  There was also some more conventional plastic explosives clearly being used as well.
[00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:07.474]  Also, we'll get more into the housing slump.
[00:13:07.494 --> 00:13:12.518]  There's a lot of freaking out by the New York Times and others that it's hurting the precious illegal aliens, not that it's hurting U.S.
[00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:12.998]  citizens.
[00:13:13.478 --> 00:13:16.741]  For illegal immigrants, housing slump takes toll.
[00:13:16.821 --> 00:13:21.345]  Also, another truck rolled over full of illegal aliens plowing through people.
[00:13:21.565 --> 00:13:22.445]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:13:24.087 --> 00:13:25.708]  And again, nothing even against these people.
[00:13:25.728 --> 00:13:31.953]  The point is they're above the law because the system wants to incentivize third-world population streaming here.
[00:13:32.725 --> 00:13:36.046]  By hook or by crook to destroy any middle class and destroy the wage base.
[00:13:36.627 --> 00:13:38.608]  Alright, I said I'd get into the shootings.
[00:13:38.628 --> 00:13:40.028]  That's just some of the news that's coming up.
[00:13:42.929 --> 00:13:44.350]  What do I say about this?
[00:13:46.711 --> 00:13:52.533]  Number one, we've got these clips we're going to play again today of the gun confiscation and some clips we haven't played before I found.
[00:13:53.494 --> 00:13:54.554]  The clips of where the U.S.
[00:13:54.614 --> 00:14:00.977]  Army led by the FBI came into the high and dry areas and confiscated the homeowner's guns and kicked them out of their houses.
[00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:12.769]  Uh, but the Bob Woodward piece that he did, he's sitting there for ABC News going, they were, the police and military weren't using force.
[00:14:13.349 --> 00:14:19.274]  And they showed them slamming them down into the concrete and handcuffing them in their homes, or on their front porches.
[00:14:20.699 --> 00:14:23.962]  It's just such semantical deception in everything.
[00:14:24.562 --> 00:14:33.190]  You can't even just talk about a report without having to stop the report every five seconds to analyze the twisting, the spin, the lies you just heard.
[00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:39.575]  But, uh, I guess Mr. Woodward then went off to Iraq after his gun confiscation piece and got his face blown off.
[00:14:42.057 --> 00:14:43.258]  Hey, at least he believes in it.
[00:14:43.298 --> 00:14:44.419]  Believes in his New World Order.
[00:14:44.579 --> 00:14:46.320]  So, you know, he put his money where his mouth was.
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.081]  You gotta respect that.
[00:14:49.543 --> 00:14:54.086]  But the troops you see on these videos are anathema to America.
[00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:55.887]  They are enemies of the Republic.
[00:14:56.307 --> 00:14:58.869]  They are traitors of the first degree.
[00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:11.137]  And if you don't know that, you haven't read the Founding Fathers, you haven't read the Federalists, the Anti-Federalists, you haven't read why this war started for liberty, how this country was born out of attempts to take our firearms.
[00:15:12.213 --> 00:15:28.958]  And I assure the scumbags in government and all the control freaks and all the king's horses and all the king's men that you will not get our guns and if 1% of us fight you when you come for them, that's over a million and a half combatants and we're gonna kick your butt.
[00:15:30.868 --> 00:15:32.249]  Of course, we know what cowards you are.
[00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:45.397]  You can't even go in and get one little punk while he's inside a dorm, shooting a bunch of kids that followed your orders to their death, just sat there like rabbits when a coyote comes up on them, just squealing and rolling around on their backs.
[00:15:46.593 --> 00:15:48.954]  Yeah, it's a good testament to what America's been turned into.
[00:15:49.314 --> 00:15:55.457]  I guarantee you, ladies and gentlemen, 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 50 years ago, somebody walked in there with a gun.
[00:15:55.937 --> 00:15:59.959]  Every man in that room would have charged him and run him over.
[00:16:00.239 --> 00:16:02.340]  He might have shot one or two in the chest, the shoulder.
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.181]  One person might have even died.
[00:16:04.781 --> 00:16:07.362]  But that person with that gun would have died, too.
[00:16:07.602 --> 00:16:08.983]  They'd have beat him to death.
[00:16:10.664 --> 00:16:13.885]  This wasn't back when Americans shot their mouths off and acted tough, either.
[00:16:14.185 --> 00:16:15.986]  It was back when we still had testosterone.
[00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:23.151]  Testosterone, it was back before men drank out all these plastics, which by the way have estrogen in them.
[00:16:23.551 --> 00:16:25.051]  Every man's got elevated estrogen.
[00:16:25.992 --> 00:16:27.592]  I'm not as manly as men used to be.
[00:16:27.672 --> 00:16:30.033]  We are being engineered into weaklings.
[00:16:30.973 --> 00:16:33.254]  Absolute pieces of effeminate filth.
[00:16:34.594 --> 00:16:35.794]  And I'm sick of it!
[00:16:38.175 --> 00:16:41.336]  In fact, there were people who tried to do mass shootings 30, 40, 50 years ago.
[00:16:42.076 --> 00:16:44.277]  And you'd get 4 or 5 people, man, but they'd rush you.
[00:16:45.445 --> 00:16:46.765]  And people wasn't even courage.
[00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:48.466]  People ran up against people.
[00:16:48.786 --> 00:16:50.046]  People were ready to get in a fight.
[00:16:50.066 --> 00:16:51.147]  It's like our founders.
[00:16:51.607 --> 00:16:59.409]  They were ready to take on... You know, there were battles where there'd be 60,000 British troops, ladies and gentlemen, against 9,000 American troops.
[00:17:00.209 --> 00:17:00.789]  And you know what?
[00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:02.690]  We lost almost every one of those battles.
[00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.270]  But in the end, we won!
[00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:10.892]  Because we were willing to put it on the line and just keep pounding their heads until they backed off!
[00:17:11.636 --> 00:17:14.019]  It's the willingness to die that gives you freedom.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.962]  It's the willingness to get in a fight.
[00:17:16.443 --> 00:17:20.188]  It's the willingness to take people on and be a man that makes you a man.
[00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:23.652]  Being a man is about your guts.
[00:17:24.333 --> 00:17:25.395]  It's about what's in you.
[00:17:26.437 --> 00:17:31.580]  You don't become a man by having a bunch of skull tattoos and strutting around sticking your chest out.
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:45.726]  You become a man because you love your family and you love your country and you've tuned in to the instincts to be a defender and a warrior who protects your tribe and to see my fellow Americans turn into jellyfish makes me sick!
[00:17:51.249 --> 00:17:53.190]  It makes me want to throw up!
[00:17:55.104 --> 00:17:56.850]  What have we turned into?
[00:17:59.158 --> 00:18:00.362]  What have we become?
[00:18:03.379 --> 00:18:06.800]  I'm gonna play some Johnny Cash, go out of a rake, come back, get into the news, take your calls.
[00:18:06.861 --> 00:18:07.901]  Lots of calls today.
[00:18:08.861 --> 00:18:10.822]  Just watching all those fat-bellied cops.
[00:18:10.842 --> 00:18:12.703]  They were just as cowardly as those students.
[00:18:13.663 --> 00:18:14.363]  Good God.
[00:18:14.603 --> 00:18:16.744]  Run on for a long time.
[00:18:17.244 --> 00:18:20.085]  Run on for a long time.
[00:18:20.205 --> 00:18:23.006]  Run on for a long time.
[00:18:23.046 --> 00:18:25.887]  Sooner or later, gonna cut you down.
[00:18:25.988 --> 00:18:28.368]  Sooner or later, gonna cut you down.
[00:18:30.699 --> 00:18:45.296]  Go tell that long-tongued liar Go and tell that midnight rider Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter Tell him that God's gonna cut him down Tell him that God's gonna cut him down
[00:18:50.462 --> 00:19:15.865]  Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news My head's been wet with the midnight dew I've been down on bended knee Talking to the man from Galilee He spoke to me with a voice so sweet I thought I heard the shuffle of angels sing He called my name and my heart stood still When he said John go do my will Go tell that long tongue liar
[00:19:16.545 --> 00:19:45.144]  Go and tell that midnight rider Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter Tell him that God's gonna cut him down Tell him that God's gonna cut him down You can run on for a long time Run on for a long time Run on for a long time Sooner or later, God'll cut you down Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
[00:19:47.166 --> 00:19:55.919]  Well, he may throw you a rock, hide your hand, workin' in the dark against your fellow man, but he sure as God made black and white.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.903]  What's done in the dark will be brought to the light.
[00:19:59.144 --> 00:20:01.708]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:09.455]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:20:09.655 --> 00:20:14.380]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.383]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:20:17.923 --> 00:20:21.267]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:20:22.086 --> 00:20:26.409]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:20:26.869 --> 00:20:30.031]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:20:30.651 --> 00:20:33.553]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:20:34.273 --> 00:20:36.415]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:20:36.455 --> 00:20:37.956]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:20:47.021 --> 00:20:47.321]  U.S.
[00:20:47.381 --> 00:20:50.603]  debt bubble red alert and real estate crash.
[00:20:50.943 --> 00:20:53.924]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:20:54.044 --> 00:20:58.446]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:20:58.847 --> 00:20:59.567]  Ask for George.
[00:21:02.404 --> 00:21:04.405]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:21:04.425 --> 00:21:07.286]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:21:07.586 --> 00:21:15.889]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:21:16.189 --> 00:21:19.030]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:23.071]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:21:24.391 --> 00:21:25.972]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:21:26.372 --> 00:21:27.293]  Take action now!

[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.442]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:21:39.562 --> 00:21:45.987]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:21:46.287 --> 00:21:48.449]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.

[00:23:10.111 --> 00:23:11.612]  The banks are defrauding you.

[00:24:30.372 --> 00:24:41.602]  33 dead at the hands of one of these foreigners who came here to suck off what's left of the corpse of this country.
[00:24:42.603 --> 00:24:44.165]  And I say, what's it matter?
[00:24:44.445 --> 00:24:47.568]  It's a degenerate, bygone nation anyways.
[00:24:50.007 --> 00:24:51.209]  A fallen titan.
[00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.532]  Overrun with scum everywhere.
[00:24:54.753 --> 00:24:58.297]  Yeah, it's shattered alright.
[00:24:58.617 --> 00:25:01.060]  Let's just play some of this.
[00:25:08.848 --> 00:25:09.688]  We're good.
[00:25:50.779 --> 00:25:51.820]  Welcome back.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:00.907]  I don't even know what to say about this shooting anymore.
[00:26:01.168 --> 00:26:01.388]  33 dead.
[00:26:02.068 --> 00:26:03.249]  Notice that.
[00:26:19.369 --> 00:26:23.972]  We had a shooting there last year with weird involvement of former military people.
[00:26:23.992 --> 00:26:27.094]  There's a big military training camp and ROTC there on the base.
[00:26:27.454 --> 00:26:31.957]  The SWAT teams had drills on that very building in the last week.
[00:26:32.117 --> 00:26:35.300]  Bomb threats, all the rest of it.
[00:26:36.741 --> 00:26:40.203]  They wait two hours before this guy
[00:26:41.721 --> 00:26:44.364]  Uh, supposedly goes on his second leg of his shooting spree.
[00:26:44.384 --> 00:26:48.310]  Then they tried to claim it might be two shooters or two separate events trying to spin that.
[00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.495]  This has every fiber of my gut.
[00:26:51.915 --> 00:26:52.416]  Just like on 9-11.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.281]  Tells me this is a black op.
[00:26:55.401 --> 00:26:59.404]  And frankly, I'm so sick of covering this stuff, I don't even want to walk through the reasons why.
[00:26:59.424 --> 00:27:02.306]  We're going to let you, the listeners, give us your take.
[00:27:02.726 --> 00:27:06.409]  And he might just be some... I guarantee you he's on some serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[00:27:06.729 --> 00:27:07.570]  There always are.
[00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:08.691]  I've never seen it where they're not.
[00:27:09.551 --> 00:27:13.494]  He probably played violent shoot-em-up video games five, six hours a day.
[00:27:14.054 --> 00:27:15.636]  You can bet your bottom dollar on that.
[00:27:15.676 --> 00:27:16.696]  That's always the same.
[00:27:18.117 --> 00:27:19.118]  Look at the past cases.
[00:27:19.158 --> 00:27:20.459]  I've been here many times covering this.
[00:27:20.479 --> 00:27:21.640]  This is always the same.
[00:27:22.483 --> 00:27:28.148]  They're always, uh, you know, 15 to 25, except maybe in the case of Buford Furrow or Larry Ashbrook.
[00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:32.552]  And, uh, he'll probably be under some weird government psychiatrist care.
[00:27:33.052 --> 00:27:34.974]  And, uh, he probably didn't do most of the shooting.
[00:27:36.355 --> 00:27:39.058]  And, of course, uh, the cops always hold back.
[00:27:39.078 --> 00:27:40.939]  You know, call them by in four hours, 15 minutes.
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.121]  This was only two hours and something here.
[00:27:43.542 --> 00:27:45.624]  But then they still ran around for a couple hours after that.
[00:27:45.704 --> 00:27:45.904]  I mean,
[00:27:47.049 --> 00:27:52.071]  Again, all of these cops who look like complete dunces in all of this Rambo outfits.
[00:27:52.392 --> 00:27:53.732]  But they're not men, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:53.752 --> 00:27:55.553]  I mean, you look at them, look at their eyes.
[00:27:56.233 --> 00:28:01.456]  Most of those cops were, I mean, I just wanted to literally wring their necks.
[00:28:01.916 --> 00:28:02.836]  I don't mean that literally.
[00:28:02.876 --> 00:28:04.277]  I just wanted to slap them around.
[00:28:05.351 --> 00:28:07.752]  And you say, I mean, but again, they're commanders.
[00:28:07.992 --> 00:28:08.292]  I knew it.
[00:28:08.312 --> 00:28:09.253]  There was the police chief.
[00:28:09.613 --> 00:28:18.816]  This effeminate bag of trash and that pathetic little sop spoken with all his Delphi technique, talking to us like we're five-year-olds.
[00:28:19.157 --> 00:28:20.297]  They go to school for that, folks.
[00:28:20.317 --> 00:28:21.898]  They openly talk about how they lied to us.
[00:28:22.338 --> 00:28:24.259]  Up there giving a line of bull.
[00:28:24.579 --> 00:28:27.840]  The governor calling in from Japan with a line of bull.
[00:28:29.527 --> 00:28:32.189]  Uh, sitting there about, you know, the school did a good job.
[00:28:32.629 --> 00:28:33.670]  Let me tell you something, folks.
[00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:47.981]  When they go find a couple dead bodies with their heads splattered all over the wall, and they didn't evacuate that dorm, and they didn't get police all over the place right then, when they'd already had a school shooting there, black op, black op, black op, black op.
[00:28:48.202 --> 00:28:49.743]  And they always hold the cops back.
[00:28:50.003 --> 00:28:51.224]  They don't let them in for hours.
[00:28:51.765 --> 00:28:53.486]  But again, in the past, you couldn't hold the police back.
[00:28:54.346 --> 00:28:57.550]  By the way, it was the same thing with the Texas Ranger.
[00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:00.974]  He was a police officer at the time, Mr. Martinez.
[00:29:02.235 --> 00:29:07.281]  Ranger Ray, Ray Martinez, and the janitor that helped him, the white janitor.
[00:29:07.682 --> 00:29:12.047]  When they went up and took that guy out, he just handed a shotgun to the janitor.
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:19.264]  When they went up there and took out the tower shooter, uh, the Marine Corps Sniper, which had mind control written all over it.
[00:29:19.284 --> 00:29:20.284]  Have you studied that one?
[00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:21.345]  Oh my God.
[00:29:21.365 --> 00:29:22.265]  I was one of your friends.
[00:29:22.285 --> 00:29:23.486]  They were real up in the program.
[00:29:23.506 --> 00:29:24.667]  I was really being studied then.
[00:29:25.727 --> 00:29:27.829]  Uh, I kept wondering why nobody called him.
[00:29:27.869 --> 00:29:29.530]  Nobody was on the radio saying respond.
[00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.131]  He drove from all the way in South Austin over there.
[00:29:32.591 --> 00:29:33.852]  He was at home having lunch.
[00:29:35.413 --> 00:29:36.894]  He drove all, he was off duty.
[00:29:36.934 --> 00:29:40.196]  He drove all the way over there, went up the tower and took that guy out.
[00:29:41.312 --> 00:29:44.896]  But see, I mean, you couldn't stop some of the police back then from doing it.
[00:29:45.497 --> 00:29:49.321]  Nowadays, they just sit around in all their combat gear, a bunch of pathetic cowards.
[00:29:53.345 --> 00:29:54.286]  We're on the march.
[00:29:54.727 --> 00:29:56.369]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.933]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.529 --> 00:30:06.791]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:30:07.051 --> 00:30:11.873]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:12.153 --> 00:30:13.574]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:30:13.654 --> 00:30:17.136]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Cal Bend Pure Soaps?
[00:30:17.256 --> 00:30:22.418]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[00:30:28.781 --> 00:30:31.262]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[00:30:37.443 --> 00:30:38.384]  No animal testing.
[00:30:38.624 --> 00:30:39.964]  I use them and love them.
[00:30:39.984 --> 00:30:41.544]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[00:30:41.845 --> 00:30:42.965]  And I say big time.
[00:30:43.265 --> 00:30:44.765]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:30:44.825 --> 00:30:45.105]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[00:30:54.748 --> 00:31:01.352]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[00:31:03.533 --> 00:31:09.196]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:31:09.316 --> 00:31:14.099]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:17.161]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:31:17.641 --> 00:31:20.983]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:31:21.807 --> 00:31:26.130]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:31:26.571 --> 00:31:29.753]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:31:30.373 --> 00:31:33.275]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:31:33.996 --> 00:31:36.138]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:31:36.178 --> 00:31:37.679]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:31:46.745 --> 00:31:47.066]  U.S.
[00:31:47.106 --> 00:31:50.330]  debt bubble red alert and real estate crash.
[00:31:50.671 --> 00:31:53.654]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:31:53.775 --> 00:31:58.200]  That's 1-888-8X-A-N-A-D-U.
[00:31:58.561 --> 00:31:59.302]  Ask for George.
[00:32:02.572 --> 00:32:04.613]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:32:05.253 --> 00:32:14.157]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:32:14.617 --> 00:32:21.839]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.000]  But now,
[00:32:25.967 --> 00:32:26.447]  I think so.
[00:32:49.875 --> 00:32:50.316]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:33:25.704 --> 00:33:32.350]  Fight the hordes!
[00:33:33.592 --> 00:33:35.053]  Sing and cry!
[00:33:40.478 --> 00:33:42.240]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:51.115]  Alright, we've got Jeffrey, Dave, Rick, a bunch of people hung up, Skeo, Eric, and others.
[00:33:51.215 --> 00:33:53.657]  I'm going to get to your calls here, but what do you expect me to do here?
[00:33:54.118 --> 00:33:54.759]  All this is happening.
[00:33:54.779 --> 00:33:56.040]  Well, I open phones throughout the show.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.365]  I will, you know what, I'll take calls, I'll settle down, and then I'll detail all this as calmly as I can.
[00:34:01.385 --> 00:34:01.445]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:01.465 --> 00:34:01.985]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:03.847]  The websites are prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:34:11.014 --> 00:34:14.335]  PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.net as well as JonesReport.com.
[00:34:14.736 --> 00:34:21.958]  All those sites have a lot of similar news, but each one every day has four or five things, sometimes ten, twenty things that are just on that site.
[00:34:22.459 --> 00:34:23.619]  So a reason to check them all out.
[00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:26.740]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeffrey in New Orleans.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.320]  You're on the air.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:27.761]  Go ahead.
[00:34:29.301 --> 00:34:29.701]  Thank you.
[00:34:29.861 --> 00:34:36.324]  While the shooting business has dominated the headlines, the Food and Drug Administration is throwing a double whammy at us.
[00:34:36.784 --> 00:34:38.545]  The regulation that is proposed is
[00:34:39.355 --> 00:34:43.718]  Number 246 Letter D-0480.
[00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:58.870]  It is a regulation that will shut down orange juice plants, apple juice plants, makers of vibrating massagers and other devices if they are used as proposed cures for diseases and declare all these materials to be drugs of all things.
[00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:23.797]  No, I know, they're moving ahead right now with the attack on the vitamins, mainline vitamins, and they'll use some example of quack cure-alls that are being, you know, going on, but the evil of the government taking control is a billion times worse than, you know, buyer beware with a few quack things that are out there that they use as case point examples, but then they want to literally, as they've done in Europe, start restricting vitamin C. That's correct, and of course, I called their 800 number, 888-463-6332,
[00:35:27.662 --> 00:35:30.403]  They referred me to a number with an area code 301.
[00:35:30.623 --> 00:35:42.365]  You dial that second number, and you put your opposition to this 246 letter D0480 on their voicemail, and let them know before April the 30th.
[00:35:43.065 --> 00:35:44.765]  That's the time we have to stop them.
[00:35:44.845 --> 00:35:47.726]  But the government just acts like they have the comment period.
[00:35:47.766 --> 00:35:51.187]  That's like a big joke, but I appreciate your call, Jeffrey.
[00:35:51.247 --> 00:35:53.407]  At least they know when you call, though, that you're not for it.
[00:35:54.242 --> 00:36:03.310]  That's really how they gauge the propaganda, to see what your feedback is, and they use that as data to then go have the PR firms decide how to attack us better.
[00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:12.237]  Every time you call for freedom and liberty and sovereignty, they just hire more police and paramilitary training in black uniforms to stomp around.
[00:36:12.557 --> 00:36:13.518]  More cameras go up.
[00:36:13.738 --> 00:36:14.759]  Hey, we don't like what you're doing!
[00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:16.481]  We may have to ban free speech!
[00:36:16.501 --> 00:36:17.501]  We're building FEMA camps!
[00:36:18.842 --> 00:36:22.085]  I mean, you know, the government's gone, the country's gone.
[00:36:22.465 --> 00:36:25.387]  We have to admit that to then set about getting it back.
[00:36:25.928 --> 00:36:27.349]  Some people get offended when I say that.
[00:36:27.609 --> 00:36:28.830]  The country's been gone since 1913.
[00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:32.413]  They've just been bringing us deeper and deeper into hell ever since.
[00:36:32.533 --> 00:36:36.776]  And until we realize just how bad it is, we can't set about getting it back, okay?
[00:36:37.296 --> 00:36:40.937]  Now, it lives in you, it lives in me, the republic is here, the liberty, the freedom.
[00:36:41.198 --> 00:36:46.300]  But we have to address that this giant superstructure all around us is a total fraud.
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:58.364]  And until people really get that burned in their head, I mean, you know the liberal and conservative thing's fake, you know it's a fraud, everybody knows that deep down, but you've got to really consciously get it and really put it into action.
[00:36:58.664 --> 00:36:59.665]  24 billion in fake news?
[00:36:59.705 --> 00:37:01.605]  I kept saying 1.6, 1.8, that was one package buy.
[00:37:04.035 --> 00:37:10.841]  I counted up, just the stuff I could find on Google, mainstream articles about different propaganda packages.
[00:37:11.141 --> 00:37:13.062]  You know how many reporters they can buy?
[00:37:13.543 --> 00:37:21.509]  I mean, the Defense Department, the CIA, the Justice Department approaches reporters and goes, here's a half mil, here's two hundred grand, here's three hundred grand.
[00:37:21.769 --> 00:37:24.871]  These are the type of packages, per reporter, per year!
[00:37:25.892 --> 00:37:27.133]  Sometimes per issue!
[00:37:27.393 --> 00:37:30.656]  There were some reporters that came out that were getting five, six paychecks.
[00:37:31.559 --> 00:37:34.040]  You realize how far gone it is, folks?
[00:37:36.641 --> 00:37:37.702]  It's unbelievable.
[00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:39.703]  Of course they're running black ops.
[00:37:39.763 --> 00:37:42.124]  Of course they're... I mean, this is how they operate.
[00:37:42.304 --> 00:37:43.785]  They're not playing games!
[00:37:46.326 --> 00:37:47.847]  Joe in West Virginia, you're on the air.
[00:37:47.887 --> 00:37:48.327]  Go ahead.
[00:37:52.369 --> 00:37:53.530]  I guess you're not there, Joe.
[00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:55.751]  Let's talk to Dave in New York.
[00:37:55.771 --> 00:37:56.211]  Go ahead, Dave.
[00:37:56.906 --> 00:37:57.807]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:37:58.007 --> 00:37:58.907]  Good, go ahead.
[00:37:58.927 --> 00:38:02.509]  Listen, about that shooting in Virginia, I think something they might have overlooked.
[00:38:02.529 --> 00:38:05.852]  They said the gunman only had two handguns, a 9mm and a .22.
[00:38:06.012 --> 00:38:15.798]  And I tell you what, it's very hard to even kill animals, let alone people with that kind of, and he had to fire 60 shots to kill 32 plus himself and wound 26.
[00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:19.780]  So I think you already know the story is bull.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.881]  It's total bull.
[00:38:22.761 --> 00:38:27.703]  I mean, I literally for the next week could just sit down and write a hundred page article and do nothing.
[00:38:27.723 --> 00:38:28.864]  But I've got to go make a film.
[00:38:29.284 --> 00:38:30.325]  I've got to litigate.
[00:38:30.445 --> 00:38:31.765]  I've got to do all these things.
[00:38:32.165 --> 00:38:35.087]  And I'm just sitting here literally wallowing in evidence.
[00:38:35.347 --> 00:38:36.787]  This thing is a black op.
[00:38:36.987 --> 00:38:37.808]  There is no doubt.
[00:38:38.048 --> 00:38:40.849]  Now I can't say publicly I know it's a black op.
[00:38:41.651 --> 00:38:48.676]  Because we haven't proven that in a court of law, but my gut, and it's never been wrong, this is a black op if there ever was one.
[00:38:49.297 --> 00:38:50.538]  I'm with you on that.
[00:38:50.558 --> 00:38:52.940]  I just want to let people know, just start looking at the evidence.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:57.803]  They're saying it right on TV, so pick up a gun and try knocking something down on a 9mm, let alone a .22.
[00:38:57.843 --> 00:38:58.323]  A .22 is a little pea.
[00:39:02.026 --> 00:39:04.410]  So you would have had to hit them right in the temple?
[00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:10.960]  The thing is they sat there literally like guinea pigs in a cage when you grab one and throw it in with a snake just shaking in the corner.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:15.827]  He'd line them up and he'd walk by and I mean as he was shooting each one no one would rush him.
[00:39:15.847 --> 00:39:17.189]  They would wait to be killed next.
[00:39:17.649 --> 00:39:24.694]  They have totally turned us into, and I'm not attacking the dead people, but I mean, they are cowards, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:24.934 --> 00:39:26.075]  Don't be a coward.
[00:39:26.315 --> 00:39:27.656]  This is going to get you killed.
[00:39:27.956 --> 00:39:30.778]  I mean, look, it's one thing, and you've got to assess it instantly.
[00:39:31.138 --> 00:39:38.323]  I mean, if somebody walks in and you're running a liquor store, and they're like, all right, I got a gun, put the money in the bag, and they seem calm.
[00:39:38.643 --> 00:39:39.544]  Now, they seem all wild.
[00:39:39.564 --> 00:39:40.625]  They're probably going to shoot you anyways.
[00:39:40.645 --> 00:39:41.425]  That happens a lot, too.
[00:39:41.465 --> 00:39:45.388]  He had to have time to reload, so I don't think that story is very accurate.
[00:39:45.428 --> 00:39:47.209]  I think black ops took those kids out.
[00:39:47.569 --> 00:39:51.413]  Because they left nobody alive to tell eyewitness accounts.
[00:39:52.894 --> 00:39:53.935]  I totally agree with you.
[00:39:53.955 --> 00:39:57.739]  And a .22, ladies and gentlemen, is illegal to hunt deer with.
[00:39:57.759 --> 00:39:59.300]  That's even a .22 long rifle.
[00:39:59.801 --> 00:40:08.769]  I mean, a .22, most of the time, a human skull is so thick, if you didn't shoot somebody dead on with a .22, it wouldn't even penetrate.
[00:40:08.789 --> 00:40:09.650]  It would graze off.
[00:40:10.522 --> 00:40:11.983]  And you'd get a big scalp tear.
[00:40:12.283 --> 00:40:14.264]  All I can tell is everybody, we need to fight back.
[00:40:14.424 --> 00:40:15.124]  I'm a Christian.
[00:40:15.184 --> 00:40:16.065]  I read the Bible.
[00:40:16.105 --> 00:40:18.646]  Everything that we're doing and everything that's been going on is in the Bible.
[00:40:18.686 --> 00:40:21.287]  Get your spiritual life in order, but we need to fight back.
[00:40:21.767 --> 00:40:22.768]  I agree with you.
[00:40:22.908 --> 00:40:24.929]  And we're going to go to a caller in Virginia Tech.
[00:40:25.249 --> 00:40:33.112]  Maybe our caller yesterday is 9-1-1 Truth or We Already Know, who was there on campus, gave us incredible reports, can call in as well.
[00:40:34.053 --> 00:40:36.374]  But Matt, maybe Matt can call in.
[00:40:37.134 --> 00:40:38.154]  But listen, folks.
[00:40:40.858 --> 00:40:43.280]  Me, five years old, six years old, in the deer stand, bored.
[00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:46.362]  And I would say, can I bring a .22 with me, too?
[00:40:46.402 --> 00:40:48.684]  And they'd be like, oh, Alex, don't be scaring the deer away.
[00:40:49.164 --> 00:40:50.885]  Just use your .243 and shoot deer.
[00:40:51.586 --> 00:40:54.148]  And I'd get bored, and I would just shoot armadillos, folks.
[00:40:55.028 --> 00:41:06.777]  And let me just tell you, with a .22 long rifle, at 50 yards away, repeatedly, I would shoot a armadillo, which is thin compared to your skull, and it would deflect.
[00:41:07.937 --> 00:41:08.238]  Okay?
[00:41:09.198 --> 00:41:10.079]  It would deflect.
[00:41:11.448 --> 00:41:12.729]  Okay, that's how that works.
[00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:14.509]  A .22 is pathetic.
[00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:18.711]  Now, it's a great assassination gun out of the point-blank range, because it bounces around.
[00:41:18.731 --> 00:41:19.772]  It'll penetrate the skull.
[00:41:20.072 --> 00:41:21.072]  Then it'll fragment.
[00:41:21.112 --> 00:41:22.113]  It'll push gas in.
[00:41:22.493 --> 00:41:24.194]  I mean, you don't even need a round with a .22.
[00:41:24.394 --> 00:41:25.934]  You can kill people with blanks.
[00:41:25.974 --> 00:41:26.995]  Did you know that?
[00:41:27.035 --> 00:41:29.216]  You can walk up, shoot somebody at point-blank range.
[00:41:29.296 --> 00:41:30.196]  It's a deadly weapon.
[00:41:30.396 --> 00:41:32.077]  It'll blow a chunk of their skull into their head.
[00:41:32.597 --> 00:41:40.401]  That's another thing the Mafia would use, but if they did that, they would usually capture you, tie you up, take you to a place they're being around, and shoot you with four or five
[00:41:41.798 --> 00:41:49.204]  Gas rounds and then your brain would literally be just slurpy in there.
[00:41:50.525 --> 00:41:54.828]  But I don't mean to get off into the whole forensics of it and how this works.
[00:41:55.449 --> 00:41:59.212]  But no, the reports are now, they sat there just like a columbine.
[00:41:59.232 --> 00:42:01.013]  Can you imagine he's right there?
[00:42:01.233 --> 00:42:04.196]  Supposedly a few feet away now it's coming out and people didn't rush.
[00:42:06.677 --> 00:42:08.719]  I mean, I just, oh my God.
[00:42:10.486 --> 00:42:15.579]  I mean, even the women I've known in my life would like claw the guy's eyes out.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.064]  I mean, I don't know what we're turning into.
[00:42:18.826 --> 00:42:19.606]  Here's the deal, though.
[00:42:19.626 --> 00:42:35.693]  They'd done drill, after drill, after drill, after drill, after drill, after drill, after drill, after drill at that school, and already had a mass shooting, and already had loudspeakers put up, and everyone was taught, stay where you are, submit it if anything happens.
[00:42:36.633 --> 00:42:37.353]  They were drilled.
[00:42:37.373 --> 00:42:38.274]  In fact, let's talk to somebody.
[00:42:38.654 --> 00:42:42.335]  Paul at Virginia Tech there in Blacksburg, Virginia.
[00:42:42.715 --> 00:42:43.816]  Thank you for coming on, Paul.
[00:42:44.446 --> 00:42:45.467]  Yeah, no problem, Alex.
[00:42:45.827 --> 00:42:50.871]  Um, I just, uh, would like to, you know, if I could have the floor for a minute or two.
[00:42:50.911 --> 00:42:51.592]  No, you got the floor.
[00:42:51.612 --> 00:42:52.232]  I'm going to shut up.
[00:42:52.252 --> 00:42:52.653]  Go ahead.
[00:42:53.073 --> 00:42:53.393]  Okay.
[00:42:53.633 --> 00:42:55.675]  Uh, you know, I have some facts here.
[00:42:56.015 --> 00:42:59.278]  Uh, first, uh, we received the email.
[00:42:59.418 --> 00:43:02.781]  First time we received the email was 9 26 AM.
[00:43:03.221 --> 00:43:05.063]  This all apparently started at 7 15.
[00:43:05.283 --> 00:43:09.146]  Uh, and it just said that a shooting incident occurred
[00:43:09.728 --> 00:43:16.632]  At West Danwood Johnson, which is the hall that police are on the scene and investigating.
[00:43:17.573 --> 00:43:22.936]  So no mention of anyone wounded or any casualties or anything like that.
[00:43:23.536 --> 00:43:28.899]  Next, a gunman was loose on campus at 9.50 a.m.
[00:43:29.279 --> 00:43:32.061]  Still no classes canceled or anything like that.
[00:43:32.681 --> 00:43:34.562]  And then finally,
[00:43:36.132 --> 00:43:43.756]  Well, actually, there was first a thing to stay put if you were on campus, and that was at 9 a.m.
[00:43:43.816 --> 00:43:45.697]  Oh yeah, you've got to stay put.
[00:43:45.737 --> 00:43:49.539]  They've got the schools ready where the toddlers aren't going to be able to get out of there.
[00:43:49.619 --> 00:43:51.120]  I mean, they're getting ready for babies.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:56.362]  You watch, folks, and they're going to sit there in a blood pit, shaking the steel doors as they die.
[00:43:56.583 --> 00:44:01.325]  And watch, when they do that, they're going to put even more locked-down doors in and go, no, it really works.
[00:44:01.345 --> 00:44:02.145]  We're going to do more of it.
[00:44:02.766 --> 00:44:02.946]  Yep.
[00:44:03.647 --> 00:44:09.151]  And, uh, finally, at 1016 a.m., classes were canceled.
[00:44:09.391 --> 00:44:24.581]  And I just want to draw a little bit of a comparison here, but I could see a 9-11 scenario where, you know, the building 1 has been hit, everything's fine, go back to work, and then, oh, building 2 is coming down, you know.
[00:44:24.861 --> 00:44:32.406]  Everything's fine, you know, we got the situation under control, go back to classes, go back to your life, and then he goes and kills 30 people.
[00:44:33.306 --> 00:44:53.800]  See, they only had to, exactly, they had to have select, look, again, it's an art form to be able to study this, but there's hundreds of indicators and pieces of data that feed into it, and I can give you basically a prime summation, and you know it, everybody instinctively knows it, even people that I know personally who used to disagree with me were in the halls of the TV station last night going, it's the government, it's the government!
[00:44:54.241 --> 00:44:57.643]  I mean, I remember the day they killed Diana, I was in San Francisco shooting
[00:44:59.657 --> 00:45:04.101]  Yeah, I mean, at first I didn't think it was, you know, the government, but as time went on, some more of these facts came out.
[00:45:27.648 --> 00:45:30.132]  Something was fishy, and don't you agree, Alex?
[00:45:30.172 --> 00:45:31.574]  Well, look, I didn't know what was going on.
[00:45:31.594 --> 00:45:34.760]  I got on air and people started... and John, who runs the show...
[00:45:35.626 --> 00:45:37.047]  I don't know what title John's got.
[00:45:37.067 --> 00:45:39.248]  He screens the calls, which, you know, he gets the calls online.
[00:45:39.268 --> 00:45:39.948]  We don't really screen them.
[00:45:40.308 --> 00:45:41.909]  He gets audio clips ready.
[00:45:41.949 --> 00:45:42.689]  He runs the show.
[00:45:42.709 --> 00:45:43.670]  He reads the news.
[00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:45.911]  He's just a real producer.
[00:45:46.571 --> 00:45:48.932]  And he just popped in and said there's been a shooting.
[00:45:48.952 --> 00:45:56.516]  And I just went on air and I said, let me guess, a whole bunch will be dead and there'll be a big time separation and there'll be drills.
[00:45:56.616 --> 00:45:57.956]  I mean, I just know.
[00:45:58.137 --> 00:46:00.258]  I mean, I've seen it too many times.
[00:46:00.298 --> 00:46:01.198]  It's always the same.
[00:46:01.618 --> 00:46:03.259]  I mean, folks, let me just give you a newsflash.
[00:46:03.679 --> 00:46:10.240]  The most mentally ill people in the past would shoot a few people and start getting nauseous and freaking out and couldn't follow through with it.
[00:46:11.141 --> 00:46:16.602]  I mean, to go around and be able to shoot close to, what is it, sixty-something people now total?
[00:46:16.962 --> 00:46:19.622]  Killing thirty-three, including himself?
[00:46:20.782 --> 00:46:22.583]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[00:46:22.683 --> 00:46:23.723]  This is unbelievable.
[00:46:24.363 --> 00:46:25.783]  I have a question for you.
[00:46:26.644 --> 00:46:29.864]  Why do you think they picked Virginia Tech to do this too?
[00:46:30.024 --> 00:46:33.105]  I mean, we're a small camp, well, not small, but
[00:46:33.519 --> 00:46:37.622]  Yeah, we're out in the middle of nowhere.
[00:46:37.743 --> 00:46:41.225]  It's easily managed because all they've got to do is infiltrate a town.
[00:46:41.566 --> 00:46:45.269]  You need to look at the history of the police chief, the history of the head of the university.
[00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:48.291]  It'll all come out, but in the next few months, it'll be on websites.
[00:46:48.571 --> 00:46:49.552]  Total proof.
[00:46:49.933 --> 00:46:52.275]  We have total proof Columbine's an inside job.
[00:46:52.535 --> 00:46:53.756]  I mean, I could spend hours on them.
[00:46:54.436 --> 00:46:55.717]  There's websites, I've covered it.
[00:46:56.637 --> 00:46:57.638]  It's total proof.
[00:46:58.278 --> 00:47:09.984]  We have total proof that the Jewish school shooting, we have almost total proof on Larry Ashbrook and the Baptist Church in Fort Worth.
[00:47:10.084 --> 00:47:17.147]  We have just, I mean, Sirhan Sirhan, that killed Bobby, just all of it.
[00:47:17.347 --> 00:47:19.248]  The person that shot Reagan, supposedly.
[00:47:19.268 --> 00:47:22.550]  The individual that shot John Lennon.
[00:47:23.234 --> 00:47:32.300]  Yeah, I mean, and then they work for the same weird, known CIA front, Christian charity, where they have these brainwashing camps, literally in the jungles, and then each one of them comes back.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:36.842]  One of them was the son of the head of World Vision, goes and shoots Reagan.
[00:47:37.243 --> 00:47:39.064]  The other guy was involved in World Vision.
[00:47:39.184 --> 00:47:44.667]  I mean, you cannot, in the same jungle camps, man, they go to jungle camps and they come back.
[00:47:45.588 --> 00:47:47.529]  Just, you cannot make this kind of stuff up!
[00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:51.652]  Now, I have one last fact to give you here.
[00:47:53.056 --> 00:47:54.637]  HB 1572.
[00:47:55.097 --> 00:48:07.706]  It was a bill that was just shot down in the state of Virginia, and this just happened Monday, and it's about allowed handguns on college campuses.
[00:48:08.266 --> 00:48:10.027]  So I thought you could just Google it.
[00:48:10.327 --> 00:48:11.108]  No, I saw it.
[00:48:11.188 --> 00:48:11.608]  I saw it.
[00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:15.330]  And again, this was a school, but thanks for telling us, because I may not have seen it.
[00:48:17.159 --> 00:48:28.825]  This is an example, because there was a big national fight, as you know, in 2005 and 2006 over the school saying, we don't care if there's a state law saying our young men and women can have guns in their own apartments to protect themselves.
[00:48:28.925 --> 00:48:30.766]  We say you can't have it, we're going to arrest you.
[00:48:31.547 --> 00:48:33.788]  You see, so there was a big national debate at your school.
[00:48:34.568 --> 00:48:39.391]  Yeah, I mean, I could see the point of not having them in the dorms because
[00:48:39.938 --> 00:48:47.004]  You know, it is a college campus, and people do drink, and they have a fight with their girlfriend, and you don't want domestic violence.
[00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:48.125]  Yeah, but here's the deal, man.
[00:48:48.145 --> 00:48:50.107]  We didn't have this stuff 50 years ago.
[00:48:51.408 --> 00:48:53.290]  I mean, people, this is incredibly rare.
[00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:54.811]  Something's happened to the people.
[00:48:55.191 --> 00:48:56.152]  That's more of a reason.
[00:48:56.192 --> 00:48:56.733]  Let me tell you something.
[00:48:57.033 --> 00:49:04.640]  My children are never going anywhere near one of these locked-down schools, whether it's... And watch, they're going to turn the universities now into mini-prisons.
[00:49:05.425 --> 00:49:08.269]  Okay, you're going to have metal detectors, you're going to be searched, you're going to be checked.
[00:49:08.289 --> 00:49:10.733]  Now they're going to have it on the buses, they're going to have it at the malls.
[00:49:11.073 --> 00:49:13.717]  Just Google FBI says they want metal detectors at malls.
[00:49:14.118 --> 00:49:15.520]  This is the new America, sir.
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:16.942]  And again...
[00:49:17.939 --> 00:49:27.689]  In every case, whether it's New Orleans or Columbine or this, when you need help, the police stand around ninnying for an hour and a half, putting gear on, and then they all just stand around.
[00:49:27.709 --> 00:49:28.650]  You look at these guys.
[00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:34.196]  I mean, men, I used to see old black and white films of men in war and, you know, cops and people.
[00:49:34.216 --> 00:49:35.437]  They were crazed looking, man.
[00:49:35.457 --> 00:49:36.658]  They had their eyes bulging out.
[00:49:36.858 --> 00:49:37.399]  They liked it.
[00:49:37.779 --> 00:49:41.422]  I mean, men, again, I'm not saying it's good to just go out and fight.
[00:49:41.702 --> 00:49:43.123]  It's good to fight when you're the good guys.
[00:49:43.143 --> 00:49:43.904]  That's your instinct.
[00:49:44.224 --> 00:49:48.467]  I mean, men used to like to, you know, get it on, man.
[00:49:48.668 --> 00:49:49.228]  Let's go!
[00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:53.311]  And I guarantee you, you couldn't stop cops 30 years ago, 40 years ago.
[00:49:53.331 --> 00:49:56.153]  I mean, that guy would have been caught.
[00:49:56.574 --> 00:50:00.737]  That guy would have been, I mean, let's say he got away with the first shootings and got to the second.
[00:50:01.037 --> 00:50:02.398]  They'd all be waiting for gunshots.
[00:50:02.418 --> 00:50:03.819]  When they heard him, they'd run in and kill him.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.802]  That guy had been dead so fast, he'd make your head spin.
[00:50:07.362 --> 00:50:13.764]  Yeah, I mean, he had chains on the door, but why didn't they just get a ram and just break right through it and just get in there, you know?
[00:50:13.784 --> 00:50:18.285]  Well, number one, they had that armored vehicle there, they're now reporting, within 45 minutes.
[00:50:18.745 --> 00:50:20.245]  Well, what good is a SWAT team?
[00:50:20.665 --> 00:50:26.347]  I guarantee you, cops in the old days would have seen a bulldozer or something, or would have commandeered a huge truck and rammed it down.
[00:50:26.887 --> 00:50:27.007]  Yeah.
[00:50:27.047 --> 00:50:33.629]  Now, you don't wait for orders from headquarters when a piece of trash is in an area blowing people's heads off.
[00:50:34.429 --> 00:50:35.349]  I agree.
[00:50:36.591 --> 00:50:38.132]  But then, it's not just the police.
[00:50:38.432 --> 00:50:39.472]  What about those students?
[00:50:39.492 --> 00:50:41.133]  I mean, let me ask you a question when we get back.
[00:50:41.753 --> 00:50:42.194]  Think about it.
[00:50:42.254 --> 00:50:47.056]  What would you do if a guy came in a room, you'd already been hearing shooting going on, and he told everybody to line up?
[00:50:47.536 --> 00:50:50.117]  I mean, I want to ask all of you this, but I want to ask you a student that was there.
[00:50:51.598 --> 00:50:54.739]  I mean, man, I mean, it's not some courage issue.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.861]  If somebody's coming down on you, you better fight them.
[00:50:58.481 --> 00:51:00.422]  I mean, I don't know how you can control yourself not to.
[00:51:05.388 --> 00:51:08.590]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.911 --> 00:51:10.872]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:11.232 --> 00:51:18.878]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.548 --> 00:51:26.613]  TerrorStorm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:27.013 --> 00:51:38.440]  TerrorStorm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.761 --> 00:51:42.263]  TerrorStorm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorists.
[00:51:42.683 --> 00:51:44.685]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.966 --> 00:51:49.150]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:02.269 --> 00:52:05.833]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:05.873 --> 00:52:06.393]  are located?
[00:52:06.593 --> 00:52:09.976]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:53:01.548 --> 00:53:03.390]  Summer is once again just around the corner.
[00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:06.051]  And as usual, so are higher gas prices.
[00:53:06.492 --> 00:53:09.694]  This year, stop taking it on the chin and start fighting back.
[00:53:10.134 --> 00:53:18.200]  Ethos FR, a product tested and found worthy by NBC and Fox News, can save you up to 19% on fuel and reduce emissions by up to 30%.
[00:53:19.141 --> 00:53:24.245]  Unlike other products and gadgets you've seen advertised, Ethos FR attacks the source of the problem.
[00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:29.894]  You see, exhaust is essentially unburned fuel that's expelled from your tailpipe.
[00:53:30.334 --> 00:53:35.179]  That equates to toxins being released into the environment and dollars being released from your wallet.
[00:53:35.599 --> 00:53:42.166]  But with Ethos FR, fuel burns more completely, helping your engine to deliver better mileage and helping you to save money.
[00:53:42.807 --> 00:53:44.348]  And, it's so easy to use.
[00:53:44.869 --> 00:53:50.816]  Simply pour a couple of ounces into your tank at every fill-up, and you're on your way to saving money and the environment.

[00:54:14.127 --> 00:54:17.531]  All right, major breaking news going up on JonesReport.com.
[00:54:18.311 --> 00:54:19.973]  It's a 99% match.
[00:54:19.993 --> 00:54:21.035]  I looked at the bone structure.
[00:54:21.075 --> 00:54:23.017]  It's got to be him or it's a family member.
[00:54:24.015 --> 00:54:32.879]  The shooter, we have listeners sent us a bonanza on a university chat board with this guy, with his family and everybody else.
[00:54:32.959 --> 00:54:34.259]  We believe it's him.
[00:54:34.279 --> 00:54:38.201]  We need to get it up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:54:38.501 --> 00:54:40.302]  But the key is the chat information.
[00:54:40.322 --> 00:54:48.605]  There's chat about the information and there's some guys making some scary looking faces on some of these photographs as well.
[00:54:49.446 --> 00:54:50.946]  We do not know if it is him.
[00:54:52.147 --> 00:54:52.747]  We are going
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.482]  We cannot say it's him, but I believe it is.
[00:54:57.002 --> 00:55:00.124]  And those will be up on JonesReport.com in the next 10 minutes.
[00:55:00.465 --> 00:55:01.666]  We just got these in.
[00:55:01.726 --> 00:55:02.646]  These just came in.
[00:55:02.906 --> 00:55:05.008]  There's only one photo of this Yahoo!
[00:55:05.388 --> 00:55:06.729]  Some student ID photo.
[00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:11.193]  And we've got a lot of listeners there at Virginia Tech.
[00:55:12.134 --> 00:55:14.695]  That'll be up on JonesReport.com in the next few minutes.
[00:55:15.776 --> 00:55:19.299]  Let's go ahead and go back to Paul at Virginia Tech.
[00:55:19.359 --> 00:55:19.999]  A student there.
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.022]  Did you ever run into the reported
[00:55:24.086 --> 00:55:24.406]  Shooter?
[00:55:25.107 --> 00:55:31.690]  No, but you know, Alex, I really am going to try to find out whether this guy was really a student or not.
[00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:44.716]  If anyone that I know had seen him before and, you know, confirmed that he was a student and not just a plant here that was, you know, here to carry out this tragic... Boy, he looks military.
[00:55:44.756 --> 00:55:47.997]  The guy I just saw looks military.
[00:55:50.968 --> 00:55:53.769]  How many listeners do I have at that university?
[00:56:09.939 --> 00:56:12.701]  Um, I really don't know, but I do.
[00:56:12.781 --> 00:56:18.623]  I have seen some people with the 9-11 Truth Movement t-shirt, uh, Loose Chains t-shirt.
[00:56:18.663 --> 00:56:19.624]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[00:56:19.664 --> 00:56:20.504]  I haven't counted it up.
[00:56:20.564 --> 00:56:29.769]  I've probably had 20 separate email addresses email me who are students, and people calling in, and people that live on campus, so it's really great that we have people in every community.
[00:56:30.367 --> 00:56:37.052]  Well, I mean, we might actually be located in the middle of nowhere, but we have a lot of people here from all over the country.
[00:56:37.092 --> 00:56:38.513]  A lot of people from D.C.
[00:56:38.573 --> 00:56:41.015]  and there, they can be pretty opinionated.
[00:56:42.717 --> 00:56:44.018]  Anything else we need to know about?
[00:56:44.038 --> 00:56:49.462]  Um, Alex, this isn't a fact, but I heard this word of mouth.
[00:56:49.906 --> 00:56:55.911]  I mean I thought about your question and you might as well go down fighting because he's probably going to kill you anyway.
[00:57:15.149 --> 00:57:15.749]  Absolutely.
[00:57:16.009 --> 00:57:17.350]  Look, I couldn't control myself.
[00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:20.391]  And I've actually had somebody pull a gun and a knife on me.
[00:57:23.291 --> 00:57:25.372]  One time, I don't want to get into stories.
[00:57:25.732 --> 00:57:27.173]  Actually, I've had knives several times.
[00:57:27.773 --> 00:57:30.453]  I don't know how I survived or why it was so rough.
[00:57:31.054 --> 00:57:34.335]  The people I ended up running with and the experience growing up.
[00:57:35.075 --> 00:57:36.175]  I'm just glad I live in Austin.
[00:57:36.215 --> 00:57:37.836]  It's not all rough and tumble like that.
[00:57:39.036 --> 00:57:39.756]  It's an instinct.
[00:57:39.796 --> 00:57:42.537]  Somebody pulls something on you, you take it away from them.
[00:57:44.993 --> 00:57:45.413]  I don't know.
[00:57:45.893 --> 00:57:48.095]  I just got this part of my brain that just attacks.
[00:57:48.456 --> 00:57:50.217]  Listen, good to have you call in.
[00:57:50.237 --> 00:57:51.118]  Anything else you want to add?
[00:57:51.919 --> 00:57:52.980]  No, that's it.
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:55.402]  Please call us if anything else develops.
[00:57:55.442 --> 00:57:57.804]  In fact, give him the hotline number, please, John.
[00:57:57.824 --> 00:58:02.528]  And please don't give that number to anybody else or people keep calling us on it and we can't use it as a hotline.
[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:08.522]  More students at Virginia Tech, or more people, the faculty, others that live on campus, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:08.562 --> 00:58:14.146]  I haven't even gotten into all the news on this yet, analyzed it, broken it down.
[00:58:14.466 --> 00:58:18.589]  I'm getting into my stride here, my second wind.
[00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:20.370]  We'll do that.
[00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:32.838]  Huge breaking news, thanks to a Virginia Tech student who has sent us dozens of photos of what appears, and I've looked at the bone structure, it's either him or his brother.
[00:58:33.884 --> 00:58:38.749]  Uh, this individual looks a year or two older than the mug shot, but it's him.
[00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:40.251]  I know it's him.
[00:58:40.411 --> 00:58:40.871]  We have him.

[01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:02.371]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:03.091 --> 01:00:04.272]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:04.852 --> 01:00:05.673]  You want answers?
[01:00:06.433 --> 01:00:07.334]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:07.994 --> 01:00:11.677]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.197 --> 01:00:16.300]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.754 --> 01:00:29.355]  Breaking exclusive news!
[01:00:29.455 --> 01:00:34.216]  Listeners have sent us chat room information off one of the sub-university sites.
[01:00:35.096 --> 01:00:41.539]  It is a spitting image of the supposed shooter with his family, with eating dinner.
[01:00:43.759 --> 01:00:50.621]  Again, if it isn't him, it is his first cousin, his brother, somebody from the same village in South Korea.
[01:00:50.721 --> 01:00:51.662]  I mean, this is him.
[01:00:53.642 --> 01:00:55.283]  Same bone structure, everything.
[01:00:56.614 --> 01:00:57.855]  We're asking, is it him?
[01:00:57.915 --> 01:00:58.715]  Looks like it's him.
[01:00:59.095 --> 01:01:01.076]  We're trying to go through all this chat room stuff.
[01:01:02.056 --> 01:01:03.596]  His name is in there, it looks like.
[01:01:03.616 --> 01:01:04.397]  We're going to find out.
[01:01:04.757 --> 01:01:06.317]  We're going to have that for you here.
[01:01:06.617 --> 01:01:11.959]  Continual coverage of the 33 dead, 20 plus wounded.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:17.261]  So this guy supposedly is just, you know, shooting almost 60 bullets.
[01:01:17.801 --> 01:01:18.441]  Reloading.
[01:01:18.501 --> 01:01:19.542]  The police can't go in.
[01:01:19.582 --> 01:01:20.482]  They can't stop him.
[01:01:21.542 --> 01:01:23.764]  And there's all this bull about how he chained the doors.
[01:01:23.824 --> 01:01:25.925]  I don't believe these police for 10 seconds.
[01:01:26.306 --> 01:01:29.728]  They sat there cowering for hours as they did with Columbine and the rest of it.
[01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:33.530]  And then they tried to claim it was another shooter and that's why it took them hours to respond.
[01:01:33.550 --> 01:01:34.871]  They're liars!
[01:01:35.031 --> 01:01:36.372]  They get on the stand every day.
[01:01:36.412 --> 01:01:38.033]  I've been there when cops lie on the stand.
[01:01:38.333 --> 01:01:39.354]  I've seen the lying.
[01:01:39.814 --> 01:01:41.535]  I know what this country's turned into.
[01:01:41.816 --> 01:01:43.337]  Trillions are missing from the Pentagon.
[01:01:43.677 --> 01:01:44.818]  Criminals run the government.
[01:01:46.377 --> 01:01:52.022]  And I'm not against the police themselves, but I know that it's a criminal system now, and the government is criminal, and many police are criminal.
[01:01:52.879 --> 01:01:53.539]  And cowardly.
[01:01:54.199 --> 01:01:54.939]  And disgusting.
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.080]  And pathetic.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:03.801]  And that's basically where I stand on that.
[01:02:03.821 --> 01:02:04.181]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:02:04.201 --> 01:02:04.881]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:09.082]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:02:09.122 --> 01:02:12.303]  Up on Prison Planet, we're going to have exclusive photos going up.
[01:02:12.443 --> 01:02:14.323]  Aaron just, I believe, just got one up.
[01:02:14.783 --> 01:02:17.444]  There's some that are spitting image up close photos of him.
[01:02:17.464 --> 01:02:18.744]  I don't think we've gotten those up yet.
[01:02:19.084 --> 01:02:20.705]  We're trying to wade through.
[01:02:20.785 --> 01:02:22.365]  I look like 50-something photos.
[01:02:23.398 --> 01:02:30.720]  We're debating whether to, you know, I mean this is a public website, so put them all up, put them all up, put them all up.
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:37.141]  This is, you know, that stuff was in public and we're going to get the message board stuff before they can take it down.
[01:02:37.182 --> 01:02:40.422]  They pulled a bunch of Columbine stuff that incriminated the government early on.
[01:02:40.482 --> 01:02:43.823]  Copy those websites, print hard copies, hit it, hit it hard.
[01:02:44.923 --> 01:02:47.284]  We are here covering this as it develops.
[01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:49.204]  The toll-free number to get to join us is 800-259-9931.
[01:02:52.242 --> 01:02:53.462]  We're about to break here in two minutes.
[01:02:53.502 --> 01:02:55.663]  I'm going to go get some of the print-offs of these message boards.
[01:02:55.683 --> 01:02:57.263]  I'm going to try to scan it for keywords.
[01:02:57.323 --> 01:02:59.724]  Guys, do a CTRL-F on those pages.
[01:02:59.744 --> 01:03:01.084]  There's like hundreds of pages.
[01:03:01.645 --> 01:03:03.505]  Do CTRL-Fs on each page.
[01:03:03.945 --> 01:03:06.746]  Type in his last name or his first name.
[01:03:07.126 --> 01:03:08.847]  Do CTRL-F word searches.
[01:03:09.167 --> 01:03:10.987]  Do it on all five computers.
[01:03:11.587 --> 01:03:12.347]  Engage.
[01:03:12.868 --> 01:03:15.068]  And then you can highlight out the key areas.
[01:03:15.488 --> 01:03:16.849]  Paste those and give those to me.
[01:03:20.007 --> 01:03:24.151]  I'm so busy I have to sit here and give orders while I'm on the air and I've got to run in there during the break and do that.
[01:03:24.171 --> 01:03:25.772]  It's an insane newsroom.
[01:03:25.792 --> 01:03:28.014]  We were here again until 2 o'clock in the morning last night.
[01:03:28.655 --> 01:03:30.996]  I left at 1.30 and then worked until about 2.30 at home.
[01:03:31.417 --> 01:03:33.619]  We are engaging the New World Order as best we can.
[01:03:33.639 --> 01:03:36.581]  And I was on Chicago Radio this morning.
[01:03:36.861 --> 01:03:37.522]  Oh man.
[01:03:38.563 --> 01:03:43.227]  But we are continuing to fight the globalists and we are not going to stop.
[01:03:44.803 --> 01:03:54.371]  Regardless if it's a black op or an inside job, and all the indicators point directly at that, unfortunately, as they almost always do, an inside job is like it always is, as Don Henley says.
[01:03:54.711 --> 01:04:06.481]  But regardless if it's an inside job, whether the government opted this, or with Virginia Tech having victim disarmament and letting everybody know that no one could be armed to protect themselves, and they already had a shooting less than a year ago there that killed several cops and others.
[01:04:07.259 --> 01:04:13.783]  And again, that was kept all real quiet as the Special Forces guy had come back to town as he and his brother were fleeing.
[01:04:13.803 --> 01:04:16.045]  And then it kind of just got swept under the rug.
[01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:18.887]  There's an ROTC facility there, an armory.
[01:04:19.107 --> 01:04:21.488]  It's a major brainwashing facility for the New World Order.
[01:04:21.868 --> 01:04:26.531]  With that, and it just stinks to high heaven.
[01:04:26.551 --> 01:04:33.276]  The bottom line, those cops didn't warn people for over an hour and a half, and then it was another hour and a half before they even engaged after that.
[01:04:33.676 --> 01:04:36.498]  We're talking, it looks like almost four hours before anything was done.
[01:04:37.779 --> 01:04:40.583]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is absolute cowardice of your government.
[01:04:40.603 --> 01:04:41.525]  It will never help you.
[01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:44.570]  I just want to train you how to be chicken-neck cowards like they are.
[01:04:55.257 --> 01:05:00.684]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:01.085 --> 01:05:08.695]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:09.409 --> 01:05:16.473]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:16.853 --> 01:05:28.279]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:28.599 --> 01:05:32.522]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:32.562 --> 01:05:34.503]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:34.823 --> 01:05:38.685]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:52.023 --> 01:05:52.783]  Terrorism!
[01:05:52.943 --> 01:05:53.684]  Terrorism!
[01:05:53.804 --> 01:05:59.846]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:06:00.106 --> 01:06:04.447]  Alarming words for our time, but how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:11.510]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne
[01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:12.531]  We're good to go.

[01:06:51.949 --> 01:06:53.690]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:06:53.811 --> 01:06:55.072]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:58.134]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:06:58.494 --> 01:07:01.276]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:07:01.797 --> 01:07:08.542]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:07:37.982 --> 01:07:38.282]  That's 877-873-9626.
[01:07:38.302 --> 01:07:42.823]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:42.843 --> 01:07:44.484]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:35.803]  We were sent by a Virginia Tech student on one of the University's sub-web pages with message boards, and in some of these photos of this Asian man, a young Asian man, the ear is identical, but the face
[01:08:37.898 --> 01:08:44.482]  It's like 98%, but obviously the person is a couple years younger in the student ID.
[01:08:46.163 --> 01:08:50.065]  We've got a side shot of him and another side shot, and we've zoomed in on the ear.
[01:08:51.466 --> 01:08:52.447]  The ear is the same.
[01:08:54.548 --> 01:09:00.952]  Paul Watson is looking at this right now, too, and I always get other people's opinions, even though I think I'm smart.
[01:09:01.492 --> 01:09:04.274]  We like to war game things around and get other people's opinions.
[01:09:05.465 --> 01:09:09.489]  I'm undecided on this at this time, and I'm glad that people are paranoid here at the office.
[01:09:09.529 --> 01:09:10.711]  We're not posting it yet.
[01:09:12.052 --> 01:09:18.719]  Again, there's only two known student IDs, side shot, front shot.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:27.468]  That is the only two photos known, and there is a shot of him with a bride, but it could be his sister.
[01:09:29.084 --> 01:09:36.507]  It could be someone else that he's standing with just because he's with a bride and this other guy wasn't married according to what we know.
[01:09:36.527 --> 01:09:37.367]  We're not sure really.
[01:09:37.807 --> 01:09:38.428]  We don't know.
[01:09:38.448 --> 01:09:43.089]  I hate sitting on something because I mean it is a public website.
[01:09:43.129 --> 01:09:45.630]  People think it's him on the university message board.
[01:09:46.971 --> 01:09:47.531]  The ear.
[01:09:48.671 --> 01:09:49.672]  The ear is the key.
[01:09:50.892 --> 01:09:53.173]  And if you look at the pattern of the cartilage
[01:09:54.145 --> 01:09:58.167]  Uh, inside the second ring of cartilage rings on the ear.
[01:09:58.187 --> 01:09:59.567]  I don't know what you call those wrinkles.
[01:10:00.328 --> 01:10:01.708]  It is the exact same pattern.
[01:10:01.728 --> 01:10:02.849]  It's like my wife's ears.
[01:10:03.429 --> 01:10:05.830]  My son has my wife's ears.
[01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:07.491]  My daughter has my wife's ears.
[01:10:07.951 --> 01:10:08.651]  Cute little ears.
[01:10:09.652 --> 01:10:13.153]  Um, but, uh, their ears look nothing like mine.
[01:10:13.213 --> 01:10:16.194]  It's the exact same shape and inner wrinkle.
[01:10:16.334 --> 01:10:17.715]  This guy's got the same ear.
[01:10:18.524 --> 01:10:21.426]  Now, I know it's a close genetic set with South Koreans.
[01:10:21.966 --> 01:10:23.787]  There's a lot of people, you know, who look similar.
[01:10:24.287 --> 01:10:26.508]  Just like certain areas of England, a lot of folks look similar.
[01:10:26.528 --> 01:10:33.352]  Uh, or, you know, certain areas of Africa, you know, the Pygmies pretty much look alike, compared to another, you know, black tribe across the river.
[01:10:34.032 --> 01:10:38.195]  But, uh, I, um, I don't know what to say about this.
[01:10:38.255 --> 01:10:39.315]  The ear has it.
[01:10:40.336 --> 01:10:42.837]  And, uh, I want my crew to go through the ears.
[01:10:43.497 --> 01:10:44.478]  Look at the ears.
[01:10:44.918 --> 01:10:46.219]  The nose is the same.
[01:10:47.308 --> 01:10:49.990]  Uh, the bottom lip is a full bottom lip.
[01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:51.571]  Look at teeth!
[01:10:52.651 --> 01:10:56.493]  Uh, the problem is, is that in his mug shots, we don't have, uh, the teeth.
[01:10:56.533 --> 01:10:57.654]  So I guess we can't do that.
[01:10:58.274 --> 01:11:03.217]  The hairline is similar, though in these photos he has a longer, more trendy hairstyle.
[01:11:04.318 --> 01:11:10.701]  Um, I just, I wish I could show it to you, the listeners, and let you decide, but I'm not gonna post these and have this be some innocent person.
[01:11:12.062 --> 01:11:13.383]  I'm pretty sure, uh...
[01:11:15.015 --> 01:11:16.817]  Man, I mean, it's gotta be a relation.
[01:11:17.017 --> 01:11:17.758]  Did he have a brother?
[01:11:17.778 --> 01:11:19.940]  I mean, this has gotta be his brother.
[01:11:20.381 --> 01:11:21.181]  What do you think, darling?
[01:11:24.084 --> 01:11:24.765]  What did you find?
[01:11:24.785 --> 01:11:32.693]  I don't, uh... Okay.
[01:11:34.235 --> 01:11:38.596]  I was brought this information Steiger name to Defense and Security Committee.
[01:11:38.656 --> 01:11:59.842]  President Charles Steiger was appointed to the Executive Committee of the Virginia Institute for Defense and Homeland Security where he will help oversee Institute policies and direction the IDHS's University and Industry Research Consortium dedicated to delivering solutions that support Homeland Security and Defense with an emphasis on telecommunications, biodefense, sensor systems, and risk management.
[01:12:03.803 --> 01:12:06.445]  I guess he was already part of Homeland Security.
[01:12:08.007 --> 01:12:09.108]  Or maybe this just happened.
[01:12:09.128 --> 01:12:16.994]  But how creepy they are, putting in all these loudspeakers the week before, that then waited hours to tell everybody that there was an attack underway.
[01:12:19.577 --> 01:12:21.839]  Oh man, there's so many points here.
[01:12:25.182 --> 01:12:29.705]  I'm sure people in the office see something important in this, and I guess it is important.
[01:12:29.725 --> 01:12:31.387]  I'll find out exactly what they mean later.
[01:12:32.474 --> 01:12:33.815]  Let's go to calls.
[01:12:34.096 --> 01:12:35.957]  Well, let's take calls here right now.
[01:12:35.977 --> 01:12:41.801]  And we're going to take a lot of your calls covering this issue and getting your take on everything that's happening.
[01:12:43.022 --> 01:12:45.784]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Florida.
[01:12:45.804 --> 01:12:46.705]  George, you're on the air.
[01:12:47.325 --> 01:12:48.246]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:12:48.426 --> 01:12:48.746]  Hi.
[01:12:49.627 --> 01:12:54.090]  Yes, I was sitting there thinking about it with the Virginia Tech students.
[01:12:54.370 --> 01:13:00.015]  Like I say, I just took my kids to school and I was talking to the school resource officer.
[01:13:00.954 --> 01:13:14.824]  Even the school resource officers said if I get these teachers to get their heads out of their rear ends and tell them it's okay to have teachers armed to protect the students because my sons are in elementary school and it is a private school.
[01:13:15.305 --> 01:13:17.366]  Well it needs to work like this, okay?
[01:13:17.386 --> 01:13:21.850]  I mean there needs to be some sensible action about it but it'll never happen unless we go completely ape.
[01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:24.672]  This happened because of victim disarmament in professors
[01:13:25.689 --> 01:13:32.336]  You have teachers, you have administrators, you know, basically don't have a criminal record.
[01:13:32.377 --> 01:13:34.439]  They shouldn't be with kids anyways if you can't trust them to be with them.
[01:13:35.363 --> 01:13:46.392]  They go simply take the concealed carry class and they have an instant access pistol safe in whatever teachers want to take the program and we stop teaching them fear and we teach people responsibility.
[01:13:46.812 --> 01:13:53.637]  Then I guarantee every three teachers would want a gun and when something happened they would be able to go for it and do something about it.
[01:13:53.977 --> 01:13:54.938]  And that is the answer.
[01:13:54.978 --> 01:13:56.339]  The answer is arming people.
[01:13:57.019 --> 01:13:58.701]  The answer is not doing that.
[01:13:58.721 --> 01:14:00.902]  And again, my dad's not that old folks.
[01:14:00.922 --> 01:14:01.343]  He's not even 60.
[01:14:02.316 --> 01:14:06.698]  And they took shotguns and whatever else they wanted to school, they stuck them right in their lockers, nobody cared.
[01:14:07.198 --> 01:14:12.401]  You walk down the street now in the country with a shotgun, cops pull over and ask you what you're doing, the country's gone.
[01:14:12.821 --> 01:14:19.504]  And you notice since we act like that, since we behave like that, since we've all been taught to ninny about guns, we have these mass shootings.
[01:14:20.624 --> 01:14:29.248]  Well, my dad is a retired police officer from Miami, and he says the gun control down there made the, the gun control laws made the city go bad.
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:33.542]  And yet only people who can get guns are drug dealers and drug cartels.
[01:14:33.582 --> 01:14:34.642]  Well, everybody knows that.
[01:14:34.702 --> 01:14:37.623]  I mean, the cities with the highest crime rate have the highest gun control.
[01:14:37.643 --> 01:14:44.927]  New York, Detroit, of course we've got Chicago, LA's got, by the way, just introduced total gun ban laws.
[01:14:45.507 --> 01:14:46.508]  And it's just going to happen.
[01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:50.810]  I mean, this is, you know, this is, I mean, look, Sarah Brady, I need a bigger actual quote out of it.
[01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:51.630]  It was in the newspaper.
[01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:56.052]  She said, before we can have total socialism in America, we've got to have gun confiscation.
[01:14:57.597 --> 01:15:08.221]  I mean, it's sad, like in L.A., you have these MS-13 gangs going into people's houses and shooting colored people at random, yet these people, these black people have no way to defend themselves.
[01:15:08.821 --> 01:15:10.802]  And the black leaders are calling for gun confiscation.
[01:15:11.082 --> 01:15:16.904]  Well, see, it's politically incorrect to talk about how there is a race war being implemented by the illegal aliens.
[01:15:16.944 --> 01:15:17.784]  This is just a fact, folks.
[01:15:17.804 --> 01:15:19.945]  I don't have a dog in the fight, as they say.
[01:15:19.965 --> 01:15:23.486]  I mean, it's just a fact that the illegal aliens will be given a green light to do whatever they want.
[01:15:24.298 --> 01:15:27.782]  And they are murdering blacks en masse all over the country, especially in Los Angeles.
[01:15:27.802 --> 01:15:28.322]  Thanks for the call.
[01:15:28.803 --> 01:15:29.123]  Thank you.
[01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:31.065]  And, uh, you know, I'm sick of it.
[01:15:32.066 --> 01:15:35.549]  And, uh, again, we're not here picking on the Latin Americans.
[01:15:35.569 --> 01:15:37.591]  They're the majority of these illegals pouring in.
[01:15:37.892 --> 01:15:38.793]  Thirty-plus million.
[01:15:38.833 --> 01:15:39.934]  Bush wants total amnesty.
[01:15:40.552 --> 01:15:42.053]  They don't have to have credit.
[01:15:42.173 --> 01:15:45.195]  They don't have to have ID to get a bank account.
[01:15:45.695 --> 01:15:49.118]  But the government wants to pull me over and search my car and search every other.
[01:15:49.138 --> 01:15:52.480]  I mean, they really... And the cops at the same time do kind of harass Hispanics.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:55.082]  I'll see Hispanics that are obviously American citizens.
[01:15:55.682 --> 01:15:58.424]  They're all like free game with the cops.
[01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:00.445]  And blacks and everybody else are free game.
[01:16:00.465 --> 01:16:03.888]  We know they pick on minorities a little bit more because they've always been green-lighted to be picked on.
[01:16:03.908 --> 01:16:05.549]  So it's kind of like grandfathered in.
[01:16:06.129 --> 01:16:07.290]  But now they're doing it to everybody.
[01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:10.332]  But you go out there and the illegal aliens are like God or something.
[01:16:11.357 --> 01:16:21.302]  I mean, I ought to change my name to Juan Garcia or something and literally just go get on five welfare checks and go get housing loans and everything and all this special treatment.
[01:16:21.842 --> 01:16:25.444]  I mean, they had banking chairman in the AP last year saying they get special treatment.
[01:16:27.105 --> 01:16:30.626]  Look, it's people, just, citizens are seen as dumb cattle.
[01:16:32.407 --> 01:16:34.088]  Brock in Canada, then Alex and others.
[01:16:34.128 --> 01:16:34.768]  Go ahead, Brock.
[01:16:35.388 --> 01:16:36.009]  Hi, Alex.
[01:16:36.529 --> 01:16:40.491]  You know, I went to the University of BC for four years.
[01:16:41.098 --> 01:16:46.419]  And I was just thinking yesterday, you know, with the report, the way it came in, and I was simulating it.
[01:16:47.019 --> 01:17:04.824]  And I'm saying, now, how could a guy kill two people in a dorm, and then take off, go back to his dorm, and then take about 20 minutes to go up to some hall, barricade the place with chains, and then shoot 60 people
[01:17:07.012 --> 01:17:09.653]  And supposedly that building had a whole bunch of doors.
[01:17:09.813 --> 01:17:11.494]  It's complete bull.
[01:17:11.694 --> 01:17:13.435]  It's complete bull.
[01:17:14.155 --> 01:17:21.438]  Yeah, well how, you know, you think about it, it just stinks of, say, Lee Harvey Oswald, I mean, trying to pull that by himself.
[01:17:21.518 --> 01:17:25.459]  I mean, I don't know how long you've been listening, but I recognize your voice.
[01:17:25.819 --> 01:17:28.780]  How many times have I said they're going to pull up a string of bees lawn massacres?
[01:17:30.141 --> 01:17:33.182]  And it's come out, mainstream Russian news, that the Russian government did that.
[01:17:34.088 --> 01:17:37.230]  They went in with black ops guys, special Spetsnaz types.
[01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:39.471]  They had a big media event.
[01:17:39.491 --> 01:17:44.154]  They pulled out the military, let them escape out the back, and the military opened fire on the building, killing a bunch of people.
[01:17:44.595 --> 01:17:46.336]  Same thing with the theater siege.
[01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:52.720]  Well, you know, we just do the simulation.
[01:17:54.561 --> 01:18:00.745]  I don't see how it's possible for a guy to tow the gun back to where his own dorm is, and then to walk
[01:18:01.708 --> 01:18:02.489]  I simulated it.
[01:18:02.609 --> 01:18:04.910]  It had to be about 15 to 20 minutes.
[01:18:05.471 --> 01:18:19.641]  And with the people flooding in the campus at the time, how can you tell me one guy could go immune, like you know, he's in a different dimension, and then chain the outside of many doors of a hall?
[01:18:20.171 --> 01:18:24.892]  I mean, that takes time and someone's going to say, what the dickens is this guy doing?
[01:18:25.172 --> 01:18:28.393]  Well, I mean, I agree it's suspicious, but you don't understand.
[01:18:29.014 --> 01:18:32.135]  When 9-11 happens, you notice you didn't see any cops for like a day on the street?
[01:18:32.395 --> 01:18:36.396]  They literally ran in fear to cower and have their captains tell them what to do.
[01:18:36.676 --> 01:18:38.096]  It's all about how to protect them.
[01:18:38.356 --> 01:18:42.518]  It's how to write tickets, raise money for the government, and how to protect themselves.
[01:18:43.538 --> 01:18:46.919]  Now, I mean, there are good cops out there, don't get me wrong, but that's what the system is.
[01:18:49.309 --> 01:18:50.750]  It's all about following orders, man.
[01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:57.515]  They got GPS on the cop cars, harassing them, tracking them, telling them what to do, micromanaging them, telling them to always follow orders.
[01:18:57.955 --> 01:19:00.177]  Used to, they just told the cops, get out there and get the bad guys.
[01:19:01.938 --> 01:19:02.819]  They've been neutered.
[01:19:02.979 --> 01:19:06.141]  They've had, they've literally been, been, uh, castrated.
[01:19:07.562 --> 01:19:08.423]  They've been gelded.
[01:19:09.864 --> 01:19:10.365]  Anything else?
[01:19:11.085 --> 01:19:13.487]  What's the grandiose scheme?
[01:19:13.567 --> 01:19:17.610]  I mean, to pull this off, is it to just enslave the people to terror?
[01:19:18.186 --> 01:19:23.870]  And to say, okay, now we have to employ another, you know, facility?
[01:19:23.890 --> 01:19:24.770]  Yeah, it's real simple.
[01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:31.275]  First you make the schools prisons, then you make the colleges prisons, then you make the workplace prisons.
[01:19:31.335 --> 01:19:36.478]  I saw Governor Ridge, Homeland Security, say you'll have ID cards, get in and out of your house, get in and out of work, to live.
[01:19:37.805 --> 01:19:39.327]  And there'll be even more shootings.
[01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:41.010]  Real and provocative.
[01:19:41.370 --> 01:19:42.732]  And again, a lot of these shootings are real.
[01:19:43.614 --> 01:19:46.117]  You know, when a guy kills four or five people or goes and kills his boss.
[01:19:46.518 --> 01:19:47.659]  This thing isn't real.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.362]  This thing is staged.
[01:19:52.648 --> 01:19:53.629]  How are you feeling today?
[01:19:53.849 --> 01:19:54.329]  Why ask?

[01:21:00.299 --> 01:21:05.142]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:21:05.343 --> 01:21:08.085]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:21:08.125 --> 01:21:09.225]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:21:10.586 --> 01:21:15.189]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:23.375]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:21:24.376 --> 01:21:27.418]  Midas Resources is offering the red buck and silver dollar for only $27.95.

[01:22:42.788 --> 01:22:43.929]  Now yet available in Iowa.
[01:22:53.416 --> 01:22:53.956]  Hey, Emily!
[01:22:54.256 --> 01:22:55.156]  Wow, you look great!
[01:22:55.497 --> 01:22:56.297]  I feel great!
[01:22:56.537 --> 01:22:58.477]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[01:22:58.837 --> 01:22:59.137]  Really?
[01:22:59.377 --> 01:22:59.798]  What is it?
[01:22:59.938 --> 01:23:00.398]  How does it work?
[01:23:00.518 --> 01:23:06.979]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[01:23:07.079 --> 01:23:09.360]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:14.641]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[01:23:14.961 --> 01:23:15.441]  That's it?
[01:23:15.682 --> 01:23:17.283]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[01:23:17.463 --> 01:23:18.183]  It is easy.
[01:23:18.364 --> 01:23:25.028]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:23:25.289 --> 01:23:26.630]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:27.630]  That's amazing!
[01:23:27.951 --> 01:23:33.295]  And, the benzenite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:23:33.555 --> 01:23:33.855]  Wow!
[01:23:34.055 --> 01:23:35.116]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[01:23:35.556 --> 01:23:38.578]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[01:23:38.658 --> 01:23:42.541]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.

[01:23:46.784 --> 01:23:48.325]  That's 800-317-9547.
[01:23:48.505 --> 01:23:57.112]  Alright, here's the deal.
[01:23:57.172 --> 01:24:00.994]  Wide open phones throughout the day, including students and others calling in.
[01:24:01.014 --> 01:24:04.277]  If you're a student, tell us, or we're nearby there in Blacksburg.
[01:24:06.218 --> 01:24:07.679]  You know, I've got a lot of affiliates.
[01:24:07.719 --> 01:24:13.723]  We're getting so many new affiliates and other folks you've had for years that I can't even keep track of it all, and I really should.
[01:24:14.524 --> 01:24:18.066]  But we've got callers call us and tell us that I'm on WKNV.
[01:24:18.106 --> 01:24:19.427]  I know I'm on a couple stations.
[01:24:20.248 --> 01:24:30.795]  I'm on a Sinclair station on Norfolk that's 50,000 watts, that covers like four states, but they carry the Sunday Show, because that's an Emma station.
[01:24:31.923 --> 01:24:32.704]  Sinclair Emmes.
[01:24:33.324 --> 01:24:35.045]  So it's Kelby J. Same thing as Austin.
[01:24:35.405 --> 01:24:36.086]  Kelby J.
[01:24:36.386 --> 01:24:36.086]  590.
[01:24:36.426 --> 01:24:38.207]  But WKNV 890.
[01:24:39.448 --> 01:24:40.488]  Joy AM.
[01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:44.331]  And I think that's a rebroadcast, though.
[01:24:44.511 --> 01:24:45.351]  I'm going to find out.
[01:24:45.511 --> 01:24:48.113]  But no wonder we're getting so many calls from Blacksburg.
[01:24:49.034 --> 01:24:52.876]  I mean, I said when I got on air, like 10-15 from students yesterday.
[01:24:52.896 --> 01:24:53.797]  That was when I was here yesterday.
[01:24:54.277 --> 01:24:57.359]  It's just filled with students and photos and documents.
[01:24:58.619 --> 01:25:00.360]  All sorts of things people saw.
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.162]  And again, I don't have a big team to track all this or follow all this.
[01:25:03.202 --> 01:25:03.883]  My head's spinning.
[01:25:04.964 --> 01:25:08.786]  I will recap the basic facts of this case and go over it when we start the next segment.
[01:25:08.806 --> 01:25:13.770]  Then I'm going to get into the gun confiscation in New Orleans, the worldwide call for gun bans here in the U.S.
[01:25:15.111 --> 01:25:19.073]  We're going to break down the history of gun control for you and just continue on out throughout the broadcast.
[01:25:19.474 --> 01:25:21.055]  Alex in New York, you're on the air.
[01:25:21.115 --> 01:25:21.735]  Thanks for holding.
[01:25:21.755 --> 01:25:26.879]  Okay, Alex is not there.
[01:25:27.688 --> 01:25:28.348]  Go ahead, Alex.
[01:25:28.928 --> 01:25:29.328]  Can you hear me?
[01:25:29.628 --> 01:25:30.129]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:31.269]  What's going on?
[01:25:31.289 --> 01:25:33.109]  First off, I want to say I support you 100%.
[01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:39.751]  You're not as well known out here in New York in a lot of circles, but I'm trying to get you known, trying to get the knowledge known.
[01:25:40.351 --> 01:25:51.353]  Let me start off by saying I have a friend, who actually has a friend who goes to that school, and he says, well, you were talking about already, how they issued the warning two hours after the first shooting incident.
[01:25:52.203 --> 01:25:59.449]  They didn't issue the warning after the second incident, they issued it before the second incident, which is really suspicious to me.
[01:25:59.789 --> 01:26:06.474]  I would think that maybe after the second shooting they would say, oh it wasn't an isolated incident, he's shooting again, we need to issue another warning.
[01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:10.798]  But then it happened before then, which shows that it wasn't an afterthought to
[01:26:12.708 --> 01:26:22.092]  Well, you have weird drills, you have the BATF being there, you have cops being killed there, and students last year with weird special forces people involved.
[01:26:22.112 --> 01:26:31.116]  I mean, I have the news articles, and they just end with the former Afghan fighter is a veteran, has disappeared, his brother is believed to have been the shooter.
[01:26:31.937 --> 01:26:38.887]  There's weird, and they put in loudspeakers to announce this, and have been having all these drills telling them how to act when the shooting started.
[01:26:38.907 --> 01:26:41.250]  I mean, let me tell you something, man.
[01:26:41.290 --> 01:26:42.432]  This thing stinks.
[01:26:42.812 --> 01:26:45.076]  And it's an anti-gun activist school.
[01:26:45.757 --> 01:26:46.438]  I mean, this is scary, man.
[01:26:49.192 --> 01:26:49.312]  Yeah.
[01:27:07.014 --> 01:27:18.444]  And next they attack the daycares, and next they attack the malls, and next they... And they've said this everywhere, and see the new economy, ITT Technical, all these little colleges and technical schools, it's all cops now.
[01:27:18.684 --> 01:27:20.345]  Come be a cop, come be a spy.
[01:27:20.565 --> 01:27:31.054]  There's ads in magazines on how to spy on your neighbors, and it's just the new economy is going to be cops everywhere, checkpoints everywhere, it has nothing to do with fighting shooters, and it won't stop shooters either!
[01:27:31.753 --> 01:27:32.594]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:27:32.654 --> 01:27:36.156]  And I take the subway every day, and I see all these new recruits.
[01:27:36.196 --> 01:27:38.458]  It just started happening, like, in the last four years.
[01:27:38.778 --> 01:27:41.740]  Every day, I see hundreds of recruits for the police department.
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:45.283]  They nearly doubled them, and now they're talking about doubling them again.
[01:27:46.215 --> 01:27:51.960]  Yeah, there's just more and more of them every day, and I shake my head every time I see them, because who do you think you're working for?
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:59.947]  And most of them are, you know, they're poor minorities like me, and they're selling out to the people who are trafficking drugs into our communities, you know?
[01:28:00.267 --> 01:28:00.888]  Absolutely.
[01:28:02.249 --> 01:28:10.516]  And then they'll arrest your minority people, they'll arrest our Americans, and put them in jails for the smallest amount of drugs when their bosses ship the poison in.
[01:28:11.343 --> 01:28:12.345]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:28:12.426 --> 01:28:20.382]  And every time, like every time I see a dude on the subway who, you know, he's obviously selling something, he look like a blood or something like that, I'll tell him, who do you think you're working for?
[01:28:20.642 --> 01:28:22.306]  Who do you think is giving you those drugs?
[01:28:22.972 --> 01:28:24.292]  You know, because they don't realize it.
[01:28:24.852 --> 01:28:27.493]  And they try to make us get into this culture.
[01:28:27.533 --> 01:28:32.274]  They show that filthy bling and try to make us all act like animals.
[01:28:32.874 --> 01:28:33.314]  Exactly.
[01:28:33.354 --> 01:28:34.355]  They try to degrade us.
[01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:35.775]  They try to make us into animals.
[01:28:36.235 --> 01:28:41.756]  They love showing black people those big grills and they love showing the white kids acting like that.
[01:28:42.436 --> 01:28:42.857]  Exactly.
[01:28:42.897 --> 01:28:44.017]  They're laughing at us, man.
[01:28:44.037 --> 01:28:44.817]  They're laughing at us.
[01:28:45.337 --> 01:28:45.757]  Exactly.
[01:28:45.777 --> 01:28:48.358]  And I tell them, don't let them turn us into animals, man.
[01:28:48.718 --> 01:28:48.958]  You know?
[01:28:50.778 --> 01:28:51.318]  Absolutely.
[01:28:51.358 --> 01:28:52.579]  God bless you.
[01:28:52.599 --> 01:28:53.360]  We're together brother.
[01:28:53.961 --> 01:28:56.983]  We're brothers in this fight against the New World Order.
[01:28:57.043 --> 01:28:57.904]  God bless you.
[01:28:57.944 --> 01:28:59.265]  Good to hear from you.
[01:29:00.106 --> 01:29:00.707]  Absolutely.
[01:29:00.727 --> 01:29:02.048]  You want to rebel out there folks.
[01:29:02.068 --> 01:29:03.449]  You don't do it with a funny haircut.
[01:29:03.969 --> 01:29:05.411]  I'm not saying you shouldn't have a funny haircut.
[01:29:05.431 --> 01:29:06.011]  Do what you want.
[01:29:06.812 --> 01:29:07.933]  I'm just telling you.
[01:29:08.033 --> 01:29:08.954]  That's not how you rebel.
[01:29:09.334 --> 01:29:12.317]  You don't rebel by selling drugs because they tell you it's the cool thing to do.
[01:29:13.050 --> 01:29:14.690]  Young people don't use their filth.
[01:29:15.011 --> 01:29:16.631]  And don't take their Prozac or Ritalin either.
[01:29:17.111 --> 01:29:17.631]  Be straight.
[01:29:17.691 --> 01:29:18.231]  Be strong.
[01:29:18.291 --> 01:29:18.851]  Be quiet.
[01:29:18.891 --> 01:29:19.812]  Get out of their system.
[01:29:20.172 --> 01:29:21.032]  Know they're the enemy.
[01:29:22.132 --> 01:29:23.192]  Just know they're the enemy.
[01:29:23.973 --> 01:29:25.073]  The government is your enemy.
[01:29:25.093 --> 01:29:26.053]  It is not our government.
[01:29:26.113 --> 01:29:27.153]  It is totally criminal.
[01:29:27.394 --> 01:29:29.334]  With social engineering, you destroy this country.
[01:29:30.114 --> 01:29:34.075]  The people running these attacks, running the... I mean, they staged terror attacks and shootings in Iraq.
[01:29:34.095 --> 01:29:34.775]  They've been caught!
[01:29:35.175 --> 01:29:39.276]  By that high-level CIA, you know, deputy... We'll be right back.
[01:29:39.296 --> 01:29:39.736]  Stay with us.
[01:29:42.555 --> 01:29:43.455]  We're on the march.
[01:29:43.955 --> 01:29:45.576]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:46.476 --> 01:29:49.257]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:52.297 --> 01:29:54.898]  Right now, 65% of Americans are overweight.
[01:29:55.038 --> 01:30:01.179]  Experts say by the year 2010, that number will increase to 75% and 35% will be obese.
[01:30:01.339 --> 01:30:10.482]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach, host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, has done extensive research and has found what he believes is the biggest breakthrough in weight loss in 50 years.

[01:30:52.057 --> 01:30:57.001]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:30:57.321 --> 01:30:59.202]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[01:30:59.403 --> 01:31:02.445]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:31:02.625 --> 01:31:05.767]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:31:06.068 --> 01:31:07.909]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:31:08.189 --> 01:31:11.891]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[01:31:12.171 --> 01:31:14.832]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[01:31:15.453 --> 01:31:19.735]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[01:31:19.955 --> 01:31:24.197]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[01:31:24.637 --> 01:31:28.959]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.

[01:31:52.921 --> 01:31:56.783]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[01:31:57.023 --> 01:32:00.905]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.

[01:32:40.419 --> 01:32:40.919]  I hurt myself
[01:33:08.021 --> 01:33:10.363]  Today.
[01:33:10.783 --> 01:33:15.648]  To see if I still feel.
[01:33:16.048 --> 01:33:21.192]  I focus on the pain.
[01:33:21.432 --> 01:33:25.936]  The only thing that's real.
[01:33:26.697 --> 01:33:31.481]  The needle tears the hole.
[01:33:32.081 --> 01:33:35.104]  The old familiar sting.
[01:33:36.878 --> 01:33:53.707]  Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become?
[01:33:54.168 --> 01:33:56.129]  My sweetest friend
[01:33:58.946 --> 01:34:07.771]  Everyone I know goes away in the end.
[01:34:09.092 --> 01:34:11.953]  And you could have it all.
[01:34:12.073 --> 01:34:17.136]  My empire of dirt, I will let you down.
[01:34:28.892 --> 01:34:30.274]  Alright, thank you Johnny Cash.
[01:34:30.414 --> 01:34:40.924]  Alright, let me lay it out right now, then we're going to go to George and Richard and Ted and Harold and Lucas and everybody else that is patiently holding right now.
[01:34:40.944 --> 01:34:51.014]  Let me just put this calmly, because I think if I calmly go over and don't get upset by it, because I feel totally threatened by it.
[01:34:51.074 --> 01:34:52.195]  I'm threatened by injustice.
[01:34:53.448 --> 01:34:59.972]  If they can CPS two-year-old children for no reason and take them away from their families and then rape them at their leisure, we're all in deep trouble.
[01:35:00.012 --> 01:35:00.693]  None of us are safe.
[01:35:01.253 --> 01:35:07.277]  If the government can take little black kids and feed them pesticide and experimental drugs until they die, none of us are safe.
[01:35:07.557 --> 01:35:08.237]  We're in deep trouble.
[01:35:09.978 --> 01:35:14.601]  And I consciously feel empathy and sadness for the little children.
[01:35:15.848 --> 01:35:18.229]  Or for those that were shot and killed at this college.
[01:35:18.589 --> 01:35:32.355]  But the reason I have that feeling is in my basic engineering, in my basic genes, in my programming, in my instincts, I know that when the people are being fed upon by a force that is over us, that we're all basically prey.
[01:35:32.995 --> 01:35:35.396]  And so see, then I seek to defend them.
[01:35:36.156 --> 01:35:38.457]  It is not some lofty thing.
[01:35:38.497 --> 01:35:40.238]  I want to explain that to you about me.
[01:35:40.918 --> 01:35:41.878]  And about yourself.
[01:35:42.659 --> 01:35:44.339]  It is our instincts, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:45.520]  It's very simple.
[01:35:46.821 --> 01:35:50.383]  It's very simple, and that's why I get so upset.
[01:35:50.443 --> 01:35:52.564]  I mean, I am in total war mode.
[01:35:53.844 --> 01:35:55.105]  I am tired of it.
[01:35:56.106 --> 01:35:58.027]  I know they've staged school shootings in the past.
[01:35:58.287 --> 01:35:59.527]  This one stinks to high heaven.
[01:36:00.188 --> 01:36:03.629]  And then I think about the reality of what we face as a society.
[01:36:03.889 --> 01:36:05.050]  So let's just talk about it right now.
[01:36:08.536 --> 01:36:33.747]  Since Columbine, they have turned almost every public school in the country into giant prison camps, and many of the private schools, where they frisk them, they search them, they search their lockers, they have cameras in the bathrooms, the school lunchrooms, the classrooms, you draw a picture of a gun, in your art class you're arrested, you carry a pixie knife, you know, the pixie forks, you know, the little box, the knives, the forks, to your after school party, you're arrested, valedictorian, they don't care.
[01:36:34.387 --> 01:36:38.350]  Zero tolerance is about getting everybody in the system training us that the world is a prison.
[01:36:38.370 --> 01:36:42.113]  You know, mass shooting to be used to turn America into a prison.
[01:36:43.134 --> 01:36:45.696]  And, bottom line, after that they said...
[01:36:48.484 --> 01:36:55.890]  We're going to turn them into prisons with barbed wire fences around them, with biometric IDs, thumb scanning, psychological testing, New Freedom Initiative.
[01:36:56.130 --> 01:37:09.261]  We get the New Freedom Initiative psychological testing manuals, and it says it's really about money, and they're going to put half the kids on drugs instead of 15% of the kids on the prescription drugs, that the molecules are more deadly than cocaine and heroin, major reports.
[01:37:09.841 --> 01:37:10.562]  See how they do it?
[01:37:10.582 --> 01:37:13.804]  They go, oh, psychiatric testing for everybody to stop shootings, and we get the
[01:37:14.785 --> 01:37:21.170]  The big pharmaceutical consortium documents, they're like, this is going to double our total profits worldwide.
[01:37:21.190 --> 01:37:22.491]  50% of the kids will be on our drugs.
[01:37:22.931 --> 01:37:24.913]  We're doing the same programs in England, Australia.
[01:37:25.413 --> 01:37:27.775]  It's always to stop school shootings and stop suicide.
[01:37:27.975 --> 01:37:29.536]  They have suicide training at the schools.
[01:37:29.556 --> 01:37:32.138]  It introduces the idea of suicide of the children.
[01:37:32.178 --> 01:37:33.759]  Numbers of suicides actually go up.
[01:37:33.979 --> 01:37:35.881]  They have more suicide training.
[01:37:36.895 --> 01:37:42.578]  More death education, more drugging, drugs linked to suicide, skyrocketing suicides, more training, more control.
[01:37:42.818 --> 01:37:50.382]  See, bigger drug war, more drugs shipped in, more people on drugs, bigger drug war, more drugs shipped in, bigger drug war.
[01:37:50.402 --> 01:37:52.463]  I mean, it just, it works like a charm!
[01:37:53.243 --> 01:38:05.109]  Iraq, they get us over there, they say we'll be there six months, their plan was to be there at least 30 years, build permanent bases, finance a civil war, carry out stage terror attacks to get the ball rolling, get the three sides fighting with each other, boom!
[01:38:06.235 --> 01:38:07.437]  Pentagon and Israeli plan.
[01:38:07.818 --> 01:38:08.960]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:09.882]  They're masters at it!
[01:38:12.366 --> 01:38:13.328]  And they do it over and over again.
[01:38:13.368 --> 01:38:14.470]  So what am I really mad about?
[01:38:17.481 --> 01:38:20.263]  Well, they've turned the schools into giant slave training centers.
[01:38:20.664 --> 01:38:25.888]  And I told you over and over again, they're going to have them in the buses, they're going to have them in the malls, because Governor Ridges announced it.
[01:38:25.928 --> 01:38:28.210]  Now they've got Viper teams in Miami and Dallas and Houston.
[01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:29.951]  That was just, what, a year ago now?
[01:38:30.391 --> 01:38:31.512]  Out randomly searching people.
[01:38:31.552 --> 01:38:34.094]  They just walk up on the side of the street and say, everybody line up, we're going to search you.
[01:38:34.254 --> 01:38:36.676]  They just walk on buses and randomly search.
[01:38:36.756 --> 01:38:38.178]  Life's going to be like the airport.
[01:38:38.818 --> 01:38:44.943]  GED people in black uniforms and armbands on huge power trips that are allowed to loot you and have their way with you.
[01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:47.271]  You think the cops are bad now, folks?
[01:38:47.531 --> 01:38:51.734]  You're going to live in like a Guatemalan-style Banana Republic.
[01:38:52.354 --> 01:38:52.635]  Okay?
[01:38:52.695 --> 01:39:02.541]  I want you all to understand, ladies and gentlemen, you're going to have those fat, cowardly slobs that wouldn't help those children, that wouldn't help those young people, ruling you.
[01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:06.293]  Wouldn't help those children at Columbine, wouldn't help those young adults there.
[01:39:06.633 --> 01:39:13.180]  They're going to run, and it's all going to be TV shows and dramas and news programs and fiction and non-fiction worshipping them.
[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:20.527]  This is, and now you're going to see all these TV shows about school shootings and dramas on 24, and it's going to introduce it into nuts minds.
[01:39:20.547 --> 01:39:22.789]  You'll have real copycats, not just provocative.
[01:39:22.969 --> 01:39:25.912]  It's like when they stage bombings in Iraq against one mosque.
[01:39:26.312 --> 01:39:33.495]  A Shia group against a Sunni, and then it gets them all fighting with each other, and then it's all copycat, and the fight starts.
[01:39:33.535 --> 01:39:34.095]  You don't have to.
[01:39:34.315 --> 01:39:38.417]  Every time it settles down, we'll get a bunch of reports of black ops, British, Israeli, U.S.
[01:39:38.437 --> 01:39:39.457]  group staging attacks.
[01:39:39.717 --> 01:39:40.958]  I mean, call it red-handed, folks.
[01:39:41.158 --> 01:39:42.978]  The guy that briefed Ronald Reagan and George Bush Jr.'
[01:39:42.958 --> 01:39:44.479]  's come on and tell you that's an inside job.
[01:39:44.979 --> 01:39:52.002]  I mean, you know, something like 80-something white guys you're seeing going in and planting a bomb for six hours, and the Golden Mosque blows up, and the Shiites and Sunnis go to war.
[01:39:53.812 --> 01:39:56.595]  Because they're just like us, dumb as dirt, and they'll buy into it, man.
[01:39:57.316 --> 01:40:00.919]  Some of them knew it was the U.S., but if they wrote about that in the newspapers, the U.S.
[01:40:00.939 --> 01:40:05.744]  would drop by and arrest everybody there and take them to Abu Ghraib for serious torture, rape torture with acid.
[01:40:06.304 --> 01:40:11.629]  A government that'll order people to rape folks with acid, folks, and that's in the Army Report, will carry out school shootings.
[01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:13.191]  You understand that?
[01:40:14.973 --> 01:40:17.155]  Now, I've set the table with that discussion.
[01:40:18.354 --> 01:40:27.358]  I remember going to school drills here in Austin where they would have the young students in there and the parents would come out later and find out the next day their kids were crying and screaming.
[01:40:27.638 --> 01:40:35.602]  We have video on Road to Tyranny of third graders crying and screaming as men in black uniforms point guns at them.
[01:40:35.742 --> 01:40:38.523]  In Minnesota there was a case, this is people I've interviewed,
[01:40:39.063 --> 01:40:42.406]  Uh, where they came into the portable buildings unannounced and said, get down.
[01:40:42.426 --> 01:40:45.728]  And they had one group of cops playing the part of terrorists saying, I'm gonna kill you.
[01:40:46.108 --> 01:40:48.410]  And children were defecating all over themselves.
[01:40:48.730 --> 01:40:53.093]  The school teacher actually passed out and had to quit teaching and is now a mental case.
[01:40:53.414 --> 01:40:54.594]  And I had her and her lawyer on.
[01:40:54.634 --> 01:40:55.475]  And this was in the paper.
[01:40:56.075 --> 01:40:59.838]  They took them, they marked her and the kids in the woods saying, we're not gonna kill you.
[01:41:00.879 --> 01:41:02.280]  Now that was in Minneapolis.
[01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:05.022]  I mean, you cannot make stuff up this evil.
[01:41:05.635 --> 01:41:13.522]  Then, remember two years ago, Associated Press, Michigan, was also in the Michigan papers, they pull in with buses, first period in the morning.
[01:41:14.403 --> 01:41:15.964]  They call out the 5th graders.
[01:41:17.545 --> 01:41:20.708]  And they have the 5th graders out there telling them it's a field trip.
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:31.630]  They get them out there and then they have dozens of people run up and start screaming, we are homeschooling parents against public education and they start throwing fake blood on them.
[01:41:33.793 --> 01:41:36.195]  The children begin totally freaking out.
[01:41:36.615 --> 01:41:38.077]  They detonate flashbangs.
[01:41:38.517 --> 01:41:58.580]  I got video of this stuff going on and wrote a tourney where the cars catch on fire and stuff and the mayor's announcing they've been hit and then a few hours later they go oh it's just a drill again it's Jim Jones Kool-Aid drills it's just training you constantly fear all these anti-terror drills it creates the perception it's real and it gets copycats to act and it demonized and now remember they just had the big article
[01:41:59.665 --> 01:42:00.106]  Where was it?
[01:42:00.146 --> 01:42:01.006]  The Carolinas?
[01:42:01.487 --> 01:42:02.668]  The parents were all real mad?
[01:42:02.708 --> 01:42:03.809]  Or was it Pennsylvania?
[01:42:04.170 --> 01:42:06.492]  Just type in conservatives mad at school drill.
[01:42:06.532 --> 01:42:07.172]  I can't remember.
[01:42:07.192 --> 01:42:08.974]  I covered it two weeks ago and now I can't remember.
[01:42:08.994 --> 01:42:09.975]  There's so many examples.
[01:42:10.476 --> 01:42:12.578]  And then they went into the school and said...
[01:42:13.691 --> 01:42:18.456]  That it was a pro-Second Amendment slash Christian group against Separation Church Estate.
[01:42:18.496 --> 01:42:21.839]  The cops are all drilled, the teachers are all drilled, the students are all drilled.
[01:42:21.939 --> 01:42:29.907]  Remember, eight months ago in Michigan Town, the school principal is a former colonel and he defended it.
[01:42:29.927 --> 01:42:30.408]  We called him.
[01:42:30.428 --> 01:42:31.689]  He was in the newspaper saying, this is good.
[01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:33.731]  And they came in unannounced.
[01:42:34.665 --> 01:42:36.026]  Screaming, we're going to kill you.
[01:42:36.486 --> 01:42:38.768]  The children, I mean a bunch of them, pooped their pants.
[01:42:39.448 --> 01:42:40.829]  Urinated all over themselves.
[01:42:41.490 --> 01:42:42.651]  It went on for hours.
[01:42:42.971 --> 01:42:45.533]  Sometimes they go in and have a drill where they tell the kids no lunch.
[01:42:45.613 --> 01:42:46.653]  Let you know what it's really like.
[01:42:46.873 --> 01:42:48.695]  The teachers make them go in the trash cans.
[01:42:48.915 --> 01:42:49.675]  Oh, don't believe me?
[01:42:49.695 --> 01:42:50.136]  Google it.
[01:42:50.356 --> 01:42:51.897]  Children going in trash cans.
[01:42:52.117 --> 01:42:53.978]  Children defecating all over themselves.
[01:42:54.038 --> 01:42:55.399]  Fake blood splattering.
[01:42:55.679 --> 01:42:57.821]  This is all, that is hardcore
[01:42:58.061 --> 01:42:59.161]  That's exactly what they do.
[01:43:25.211 --> 01:43:29.615]  And then they beat up other people in there and go, we'll beat you up next if you don't rat them out.
[01:43:29.835 --> 01:43:34.880]  And they train everybody to rat on each other and do all this and they kill all the strong and it's just scum.
[01:43:35.501 --> 01:43:37.583]  Oh my God, that's what they've turned us into.
[01:43:37.823 --> 01:43:39.945]  And now it's going to be mass re-education everywhere.
[01:43:39.985 --> 01:43:40.966]  It'll be in the colleges.
[01:43:41.266 --> 01:43:43.248]  They'll search you to go on the college campuses.
[01:43:43.528 --> 01:43:46.471]  It's just going to get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[01:43:46.771 --> 01:43:48.192]  And it's going to be at the shopping malls.
[01:43:48.252 --> 01:43:49.193]  It's going to be everywhere.
[01:43:50.354 --> 01:43:55.960]  Goon, fat-bellied, dumb cops everywhere thinking they're God's gift to mankind.
[01:43:56.340 --> 01:43:58.943]  Movie stars saying they're super sexy on TV.
[01:43:59.203 --> 01:44:01.246]  Your daughters will want to date these hogs.
[01:44:01.546 --> 01:44:04.409]  It'll just be like Nazi Germany worshipping them.
[01:44:05.790 --> 01:44:06.791]  Or we can stop them.
[01:44:07.111 --> 01:44:10.395]  Or we can say no to them and tell them that they're not going to get what they want.
[01:44:12.094 --> 01:44:13.495]  And again, those guys were hogs.
[01:44:13.595 --> 01:44:15.116]  Big, fat people.
[01:44:15.637 --> 01:44:16.477]  And another thing is fat people.
[01:44:16.497 --> 01:44:17.118]  I'm a little overweight.
[01:44:17.138 --> 01:44:19.179]  But I mean, just running around in commando gear.
[01:44:19.359 --> 01:44:20.920]  Waddling with machine guns.
[01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:21.941]  And you see how scared they are.
[01:44:21.961 --> 01:44:23.062]  They get behind cars and trees.
[01:44:23.102 --> 01:44:24.243]  And you can see them breathing.
[01:44:24.303 --> 01:44:27.205]  And they're making... I'm sorry, they're making a real effeminate face.
[01:44:27.225 --> 01:44:28.446]  They're like, oh, real Nelly.
[01:44:28.466 --> 01:44:30.407]  Oh, oh, oh, you see it?
[01:44:30.427 --> 01:44:31.868]  Oh, gosh, what's wrong with you?
[01:44:32.128 --> 01:44:33.049]  What's wrong with you?
[01:44:33.069 --> 01:44:33.910]  It's the same thing.
[01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:37.912]  I saw the same video of a bunch of Nellies out there at Columbine.
[01:44:38.273 --> 01:44:39.814]  Because you're just cowards!
[01:44:42.293 --> 01:44:43.874]  That's all you are is scum!
[01:44:44.754 --> 01:44:49.056]  Because anybody, I mean, real men don't want to go dress up in the little outfits you get in an act tough.
[01:44:50.577 --> 01:44:52.178]  You run all the real cops off.
[01:44:52.518 --> 01:44:53.778]  You're a bunch of control freaks.
[01:44:54.999 --> 01:45:00.722]  Who like to pull families over on the side of the road and order them around and search their vehicles looking for drugs your boss has brought in.
[01:45:00.742 --> 01:45:05.544]  Why don't you take those drugs and just... Just pound sand, man.
[01:45:05.584 --> 01:45:07.045]  Just get out of my way.
[01:45:07.365 --> 01:45:09.786]  Stop destroying my country, you parasites.
[01:45:11.121 --> 01:45:30.025]  You went in there and you wouldn't let anybody be armed, and if you'd let those people be armed, I guarantee you, those professors, that guy might have killed two or three people, or whoever really did the shooting, if you believe this, got sixty shots off or more, and then no one could ever stop him, and he hit all his targets, and could bolt all these doors next to the military compound, and I mean, give me a break.
[01:45:34.026 --> 01:45:35.266]  Give me a break.
[01:45:37.242 --> 01:45:39.367]  This is absolutely pathetic.
[01:45:39.687 --> 01:45:40.208]  And you know what?
[01:45:40.248 --> 01:45:41.351]  I'm seeing the news trends.
[01:45:41.731 --> 01:45:43.996]  All these governments are calling for gun bans.
[01:45:44.337 --> 01:45:48.526]  You know, the Australians, that was a total stage deal they did.
[01:45:49.659 --> 01:45:50.700]  Let me dig that out.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:46:00.086]  They had that stage thing where he shot 20, killed 20-something people, and it turned out he was in weird psychiatric care and under government control, and he'd been allowed to get in with guns.
[01:46:00.106 --> 01:46:01.007]  You ought to go read this.
[01:46:01.067 --> 01:46:02.408]  They just banned almost everything.
[01:46:02.728 --> 01:46:05.770]  Crocodile Dundee, the real Crocodile Dundee, wouldn't turn in his guns.
[01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:06.631]  This is something nobody knows.
[01:46:06.891 --> 01:46:08.172]  He looked just like the guy in the movie.
[01:46:08.432 --> 01:46:09.933]  They went to his house and gunned him down.
[01:46:09.973 --> 01:46:11.174]  Not before he got two of them, though.
[01:46:12.755 --> 01:46:18.279]  The real Crocodile Dundee was killed in his backwoods area, outback area, where he wouldn't turn his guns in.
[01:46:19.164 --> 01:46:19.684]  Did you know that?
[01:46:21.085 --> 01:46:23.566]  Yeah, they killed the real Crocodile Dundee folks.
[01:46:24.106 --> 01:46:26.067]  Look, just like the guy in the movies.
[01:46:26.447 --> 01:46:27.347]  That's who it was based on.
[01:46:28.388 --> 01:46:29.308]  Murdered him.
[01:46:29.328 --> 01:46:33.870]  I mean, that bar, everything from that movie is based on that real guy.
[01:46:34.330 --> 01:46:39.532]  Blonde hair, long blonde hair, the exact guy, really, you know, I mean, that Steve Irwin guy tried to copy him.
[01:46:39.552 --> 01:46:40.972]  The guy didn't even want to go to movie premieres.
[01:46:40.993 --> 01:46:41.953]  He didn't want to be involved.
[01:46:42.133 --> 01:46:44.054]  He literally lived in the Outback with the Aborigines.
[01:46:45.194 --> 01:46:47.275]  And then they came to take his guns and
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:49.981]  He didn't let them have him.
[01:46:50.641 --> 01:46:51.922]  And they killed him, folks.
[01:46:52.742 --> 01:46:54.483]  Took trophy photos of his dead body.
[01:46:54.543 --> 01:46:55.704]  That's how real men act.
[01:46:55.744 --> 01:46:57.144]  You go kill somebody like him.
[01:46:57.164 --> 01:46:58.665]  You know, you're scum.
[01:47:00.606 --> 01:47:01.907]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:47:03.307 --> 01:47:04.208]  Let me just tell you something.
[01:47:04.588 --> 01:47:08.050]  Don't you ever come get my children and dump fake blood on them and put guns to their heads.
[01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:08.610]  You understand?
[01:47:09.991 --> 01:47:11.752]  And again, the cops are being brainwashed, too.
[01:47:12.592 --> 01:47:13.713]  They're told to go do this?
[01:47:14.747 --> 01:47:18.055]  Go do these obscene drills and I've got all this drill news here in front of me.
[01:47:18.455 --> 01:47:22.485]  Emergency response exercise to be held at Blue Angels Elementary School Wednesday.
[01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:33.245]  Escamina County School District, this is in Florida, and the Escamina County Sheriff's Office will be conducting an emergency response exercise at the Blue Angels Elementary School, terrorizing those little kids.
[01:47:33.925 --> 01:47:35.226]  Keep your heads home, folks.
[01:47:35.266 --> 01:47:36.387]  Get them out of the government camp.
[01:47:36.767 --> 01:47:41.009]  The scenario for the exercise will provide a all-around and active shooter situation.
[01:47:41.029 --> 01:47:42.290]  It's scheduled to start at 1 p.m.
[01:47:42.610 --> 01:47:43.951]  and conclude at approximately 5 p.m.
[01:47:43.991 --> 01:47:46.612]  They're going to torture your kids for four hours.
[01:47:47.583 --> 01:47:52.065]  The exercise is intended to test the responsibilities of various public safety agencies.
[01:47:52.265 --> 01:47:56.226]  Will they shoot a kid in the face like they did in Detroit a few years ago?
[01:47:56.506 --> 01:47:59.827]  What about cop in the year you shot in the head during a drill in Fort Worth?
[01:48:00.567 --> 01:48:03.568]  Just type in cops, police shoot children and drill.
[01:48:03.608 --> 01:48:07.330]  There's been so many, I can't remember them all.
[01:48:08.130 --> 01:48:10.331]  Anybody with a brain won't go be one of these cops, man.
[01:48:10.351 --> 01:48:16.833]  These are just gun happy, weak people, probably bullies, beat up kids, five grades lower than them.
[01:48:17.825 --> 01:48:28.175]  You know, never were good at football, got run over at football, and now they're on steroids at 35, and they want to be tough, and they're going to pull you and your family over, and you're going to get to help them boss you around.
[01:48:28.195 --> 01:48:32.559]  And they're going to go into school, and they're going to shoot your kid right in the head while they're screaming at them.
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:36.483]  They're going to blow your kid's teeth all over the wall like they did that little black kid.
[01:48:36.503 --> 01:48:39.386]  Well, that's always a black kid, I don't know, it isn't real.
[01:48:39.827 --> 01:48:40.968]  And you're going to learn to love it.
[01:48:41.508 --> 01:48:42.109]  You understand?
[01:48:46.022 --> 01:48:48.163]  Okay, you can tell I'm hot today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:49.383 --> 01:48:54.465]  Bottom line, the scumbag government can't and won't help you and doesn't want to help you.
[01:48:54.945 --> 01:48:55.785]  I'm going to say it again.
[01:48:55.865 --> 01:48:57.426]  How could a government stage an event like this?
[01:48:57.466 --> 01:48:58.426]  We don't know if that's the case.
[01:48:58.506 --> 01:48:59.446]  Every indice shows it.
[01:48:59.846 --> 01:49:03.468]  Every indicator, my nose tells me that's it, but we've got to continue to check into it first.
[01:49:04.348 --> 01:49:05.668]  How many times have we been right in the past?
[01:49:05.688 --> 01:49:07.689]  This thing stinks to heaven.
[01:49:07.749 --> 01:49:08.369]  Past heaven.
[01:49:09.329 --> 01:49:13.331]  And again, Katrina, they didn't come with food and water to help you.
[01:49:13.351 --> 01:49:14.331]  They came to take your guns.
[01:49:15.006 --> 01:49:16.187]  And they will come to take your guns.
[01:49:16.207 --> 01:49:16.907]  That's their mission.
[01:49:17.087 --> 01:49:20.809]  One is to dominate the population, their cattle, that pay their salaries.
[01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:26.191]  We're the dumb hogs that are here to be milked and fed on by these people.
[01:49:27.092 --> 01:49:30.453]  We're the fat cows that are here to be milked by these people.
[01:49:30.793 --> 01:49:31.634]  That's how they see us.
[01:49:31.674 --> 01:49:36.556]  And they tell these dumb cops, you've got to write more tickets or we can't pay your $35,000 a year salary.
[01:49:37.016 --> 01:49:39.237]  And the average cop raises almost $300,000 a year.
[01:49:39.297 --> 01:49:40.778]  You people are complete ignoramuses.
[01:49:41.658 --> 01:50:01.058]  You go out and rack 15 tickets a day, 10 tickets a day, and look at how much you're actually, how much you actually, you just, it's just, they control you, they, they, they, and they're going to take everything you've got too, but don't worry, you'll still be able to live in your one room apartment and have your uniform, so at least when you strut around, people will give you respect, and if that's all you care about is some type of petty status, then great.
[01:50:01.799 --> 01:50:02.960]  Great, you helped kill your country.
[01:50:03.815 --> 01:50:18.240]  And again, I just, I don't have respect for cops anymore because I've seen them treat citizens rude, I've seen you act arrogant, I've seen you act like a bunch of punks, I've seen a lot of other nice cops, but the policy is to act like scum, and then when it comes down to protecting the people, you're a bunch of cowards.
[01:50:19.541 --> 01:50:24.543]  And then you always arrest some guy who sees a guy mugging somebody or shooting somebody who takes them out.
[01:50:25.383 --> 01:50:28.264]  And by the way, citizens many more times than police stop crime.
[01:50:29.349 --> 01:50:33.674]  Because the person that really you got to know is tough is the person that doesn't want to exercise power.
[01:50:34.174 --> 01:50:35.696]  It's the person who wants to be left alone.
[01:50:35.736 --> 01:50:36.657]  It's the quiet man.
[01:50:36.677 --> 01:50:38.158]  And everybody knows that.
[01:50:38.639 --> 01:50:40.220]  You just keep shoving us around.
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:41.482]  You keep pushing us around.
[01:50:41.902 --> 01:50:43.183]  You keep thinking you rule us.
[01:50:43.203 --> 01:50:44.805]  And let me give you the little news flash.
[01:50:45.265 --> 01:50:45.766]  You don't.
[01:50:46.226 --> 01:50:47.107]  You understand that?
[01:50:47.448 --> 01:50:50.571]  You've taken our... Restraint is weakness and you're wrong.
[01:50:55.373 --> 01:51:00.822]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:51:01.182 --> 01:51:08.814]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:09.511 --> 01:51:16.576]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:16.977 --> 01:51:28.405]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:51:28.705 --> 01:51:32.228]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:51:32.668 --> 01:51:34.610]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:51:34.930 --> 01:51:38.793]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:52.302 --> 01:51:55.464]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:51:55.504 --> 01:51:59.547]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:51:59.667 --> 01:52:02.229]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:52:02.289 --> 01:52:04.630]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:52:04.811 --> 01:52:13.256]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:52:13.336 --> 01:52:14.637]  The Brookie light is different.
[01:52:14.777 --> 01:52:18.780]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:19.280]  We're good to go!
[01:52:39.286 --> 01:52:44.131]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.

[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:53.741]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:52:53.961 --> 01:52:57.664]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:52:57.984 --> 01:53:00.205]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:53:00.726 --> 01:53:06.930]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:53:07.090 --> 01:53:11.993]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:53:12.193 --> 01:53:21.139]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[01:53:53.383 --> 01:53:55.084]  We're good.
[01:54:22.498 --> 01:54:24.499]  Alright, more of your calls are coming up.
[01:54:24.519 --> 01:54:25.680]  Continual coverage.
[01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:30.682]  I'm going to get into some other world news as well.
[01:54:30.702 --> 01:54:30.982]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:32.143 --> 01:54:35.964]  It's not just that the government or elements of the government are behind a lot of these shootings and terror attacks.
[01:54:36.004 --> 01:54:36.925]  They relish it.
[01:54:36.945 --> 01:54:37.745]  They love it.
[01:54:38.666 --> 01:54:42.747]  I mean, still, with school shootings, mass shootings have actually gone down in the last 20 years.
[01:54:42.767 --> 01:54:43.988]  You can just type that in.
[01:54:44.008 --> 01:54:46.149]  School shootings down in the last decade, last 20 years.
[01:54:46.169 --> 01:54:48.230]  These are different statistics, but they show the same thing.
[01:54:48.974 --> 01:54:54.340]  You have a much better chance of being struck by lightning, drowning, crawling and busting your head open and dying.
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:55:00.066]  Car wrecks, I mean, it's just unbelievably, hundreds and hundreds of times better chance of dying from that.
[01:55:02.208 --> 01:55:04.090]  Are they going to ban all the swimming pools?
[01:55:04.130 --> 01:55:05.771]  Are they going to ban all the lakes?
[01:55:05.791 --> 01:55:07.974]  Are they going to ban all the bathtubs, all the hot tubs?
[01:55:08.835 --> 01:55:09.055]  No!
[01:55:09.215 --> 01:55:10.096]  They're not going to do that.
[01:55:11.161 --> 01:55:22.791]  But they're going to make your life a living hell, living in a literal Nazi Germany, but the borders will be wide open, and those folks will all be in sanctuary cities, and they're not to be searched, and the local cops are told to leave them alone.
[01:55:23.291 --> 01:55:23.732]  On record!
[01:55:24.012 --> 01:55:25.633]  And again, I'm not bashing the illegals.
[01:55:26.114 --> 01:55:27.054]  Not even against these people.
[01:55:27.074 --> 01:55:29.056]  The point is, it just shows it's all a fraud.
[01:55:29.076 --> 01:55:33.540]  It's about us, the dumb idiots, that put up with anything and take anything.
[01:55:35.353 --> 01:55:41.440]  By the way, we're still trying to figure out if these photos are this guy, but now we've got a YouTube clip where he does say his name, does say who he is.
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:43.101]  It was posted on the 9th.
[01:55:43.802 --> 01:55:46.745]  That would be a full six days before this happened.
[01:55:47.166 --> 01:55:49.448]  And it looks like him, and he's playing heavy metal.
[01:55:49.508 --> 01:55:50.549]  I made a deal with the devil.
[01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:53.813]  And he's whispering something, and he's saying, see if you can tell what I'm saying.
[01:55:54.947 --> 01:56:01.270]  And it looks pretty cryptic, and Harris and Kleibal did the same thing, you know, with videos they posted and stuff, and audios.
[01:56:01.690 --> 01:56:03.531]  We're going to see what's going on with this.
[01:56:03.551 --> 01:56:06.052]  We're getting it up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:56:06.072 --> 01:56:08.713]  We'll just put the video up there and say, is this the guy?
[01:56:09.014 --> 01:56:09.834]  The name is the same.
[01:56:10.598 --> 01:56:14.679]  I'm going to get that up on PrisonPlanet.com right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:18.841]  We'll be getting that up there and also on JonesReport.com for you.
[01:56:18.901 --> 01:56:23.783]  I made the decision to go ahead and put this up because my wife's in there watching and she says it is the same name and it looks just like him.
[01:56:24.703 --> 01:56:34.446]  I mean, sorry, it's a guy that looks just like him with the same name, playing a thing about how he made a deal with the devil, and acting very bizarre, and so we're posting it.
[01:56:35.227 --> 01:56:38.748]  Thank you, bless you, keep sending us clues, keep sending us tips, keep sending us info.
[01:56:40.191 --> 01:56:49.774]  Also, if you would like to support us, we're going to start the next hour, go to your calls, recap all the news, what we know, the latest, the inside on this, and then get into some geopolitical news, some things with the dollar.
[01:56:50.554 --> 01:56:57.056]  Because of the shooting, Alberto Gonzales' hearing is off now, looks like he'll skate now for all his lying and criminality.
[01:56:57.356 --> 01:56:59.317]  Always, how these tragedies help these people.
[01:57:00.590 --> 01:57:24.778]  I hope that you will visit InfoWars.com, the safe, secure online video and bookstore shopping cart, and get William Rodriguez's new video he's put out, get my film Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, over three hours with the extras, 9-1-1 press for truth, they lied, they all died, Mind Control, a brave new world, enhancing human performance by Dr. Nick Baggage.
[01:57:24.818 --> 01:57:26.218]  This video is really important, right?
[01:57:26.558 --> 01:57:27.018]  You know what?
[01:57:27.058 --> 01:57:27.979]  That's who I want on.
[01:57:28.059 --> 01:57:29.419]  Call Dr. Nick Baggage.
[01:57:30.265 --> 01:57:31.626]  My producer was saying, do you want anybody on?
[01:57:31.646 --> 01:57:32.928]  I'm like, no, cancel the other guests.
[01:57:33.188 --> 01:57:35.150]  Let's try to get Nick Bagachon on in the last 30 minutes.
[01:57:35.170 --> 01:57:36.551]  Get his take just on mind control.
[01:57:36.852 --> 01:57:38.473]  Could they program a shooter to do this?
[01:57:38.493 --> 01:57:43.498]  Of course, it's all declassified, admitted, but it's always good to have... His dad was a former congressman.
[01:57:43.538 --> 01:57:46.040]  His brother is a mayor there.
[01:57:47.367 --> 01:57:54.372]  One of them's been a governor before, too, and he's got a bunch of degrees in this type of stuff, and written books, and made films on the subject of mind control.
[01:57:54.753 --> 01:58:07.423]  Mind Control, A Brave New World, or Enhancing Human Performance, Iraq Resell, The War Profiteers, America, Freedom from Fascism by Aaron Russo, the new video we're carrying, Riddles in Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C., absolutely amazing.
[01:58:07.743 --> 01:58:09.104]  Big discounts on all these.
[01:58:09.144 --> 01:58:14.288]  Some of these films as low as $5.95 at InfoWars.com when you get them as part of package deals.
[01:58:14.748 --> 01:58:19.249]  It's all about getting the info out.
[01:58:19.269 --> 01:58:25.711]  1-888-253-3139 is also the toll-free number to call and get the videos or books or t-shirts we carry.
[01:58:26.671 --> 01:58:28.411]  Alright, or don't forget prisonplanet.tv.
[01:58:28.431 --> 01:58:29.612]  We'll be right back with a third hour.
[01:58:32.172 --> 01:58:36.073]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:58:36.413 --> 01:58:37.273]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:58:48.359 --> 01:58:49.000]  Big Brother.
[01:58:49.661 --> 01:58:50.741]  Mainstream media.
[01:58:51.422 --> 01:58:52.563]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:53.203 --> 01:58:54.004]  You want answers?
[01:58:54.765 --> 01:58:55.685]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:56.326 --> 01:58:59.989]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:00.529 --> 01:59:04.613]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:59:23.518 --> 01:59:24.058]  Welcome back.
[01:59:24.098 --> 01:59:26.159]  We're now into the third hour.
[01:59:26.179 --> 01:59:29.120]  We're working on getting Dr. Nick Baggage, expert on mind control, on.
[01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:29.980]  I just thought to do that.
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:31.240]  If he's not on today, he'll be on tomorrow.
[01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:33.021]  He's got a talk show right here on Genesis.
[01:59:35.101 --> 01:59:41.203]  We have been covering the horrible mass shooting, 33 dead, close to 30 seriously wounded.
[01:59:44.784 --> 01:59:54.049]  And the bottom line is, gun control law helped the campus killer, yet disarmament lobby and establishment media exploit tragedy to disarm more potential victims.
[01:59:54.069 --> 01:59:57.831]  I want to go over this article, some of the latest news there.
[01:59:58.291 --> 01:59:59.632]  But right now, let's go to your calls.
[01:59:59.652 --> 02:00:00.252]  Who's up next?
[02:00:02.354 --> 02:00:04.054]  George in Canada, then Richard and others.
[02:00:04.094 --> 02:00:04.675]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:04.715 --> 02:00:05.035]  Go ahead.
[02:00:05.055 --> 02:00:06.456]  Well, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:00:06.716 --> 02:00:11.959]  There'll be a showing of Terror Storm at the University of Toronto this evening at University College at 7 p.m.
[02:00:11.979 --> 02:00:14.140]  for people that are in the Toronto area that would like to
[02:00:14.784 --> 02:00:17.405]  Mingle with people who know and see a good film.
[02:00:18.206 --> 02:00:22.028]  And you can still get under the university for now without going through barbaric checkpoints?
[02:00:22.588 --> 02:00:29.912]  Well, I'm a long-term university cop, Alex, and there's a few things that I'd like to bring forward.
[02:00:29.952 --> 02:00:31.373]  Oh my God, you've got the floor!
[02:00:31.453 --> 02:00:33.013]  Please give us your take on this.
[02:00:33.253 --> 02:00:34.654]  And I'm not trying to bash police.
[02:00:34.674 --> 02:00:36.035]  You're bashing the system.
[02:00:36.855 --> 02:00:39.297]  Well, I understand I was bashing the system for a long time.
[02:00:39.317 --> 02:00:40.337]  That's why I'm an ex-cop.
[02:00:41.138 --> 02:00:43.099]  I'm not too keen on being neutered.
[02:00:44.525 --> 02:00:59.097]  A university, a community, is a community within a community, and it's routine practice at every campus to seal it off, so that students can partake in various functions without having to worry about outside influences coming in to disturb them.
[02:00:59.117 --> 02:01:08.965]  So setting up a series of roadblocks, controlling access to very large pieces of property, is very much routine on any university campus in Canada and the United States.
[02:01:09.125 --> 02:01:09.986]  In second nature!
[02:01:10.506 --> 02:01:12.408]  Now, after a double homicide,
[02:01:12.887 --> 02:01:28.858]  Where you're looking for a dangerous felon with a firearm, I find it unfathomable that a series of roadblocks weren't set up, not so much to prevent the students from coming in because they couldn't anticipate what was going to happen, but to prevent the felon from escaping.
[02:01:29.519 --> 02:01:31.900]  And it's just beyond a belief.
[02:01:33.141 --> 02:01:38.205]  I've read university policy procedures handbooks from American universities,
[02:01:38.581 --> 02:01:45.926]  They have very serious plans, in effect, to use all county, state, and local law enforcement to come to the aid of the military.
[02:01:45.946 --> 02:01:48.468]  Now I know, within minutes, something weird is going on.
[02:01:48.508 --> 02:01:52.111]  I mean, if there's a bomb threat, I'm talking in five minutes, those things are locked down.
[02:01:52.531 --> 02:01:52.871]  Always.
[02:01:52.891 --> 02:01:53.832]  I mean, what's going on here?
[02:01:54.512 --> 02:02:01.637]  What's going on is, I think we know what's going on, is we have another coordinated, allowed event to happen.
[02:02:02.038 --> 02:02:03.939]  We can only hypothesize at this point.
[02:02:04.383 --> 02:02:25.272]  But one thing I would like to explain to people, I know you've said it and a lot of other radio hosts have talked about the availability of firearms on campus as a means to defend yourself, but also having taken a lot of specialist courses and things, sometimes you just have to fight with what's at hand, and you do have very, very powerful things at hand in any public building.
[02:02:25.673 --> 02:02:33.196]  I wrote a piece when we had the last Canadian massacre, it was posted on a Toronto website for a very long time, and it's called How to Defend Your School.
[02:02:33.887 --> 02:02:37.441]  And you have the firefighting equipment in your schools, a fire hose.
[02:02:38.331 --> 02:02:42.674]  And one knock, an average-sized man on his butt very, very quickly, but it makes the floor slippery.
[02:02:42.714 --> 02:02:43.295]  He can't run.
[02:02:43.635 --> 02:02:44.656]  He's going to slip and fall.
[02:02:44.756 --> 02:02:49.119]  Once he slips and falls and slides into the wall, you can easily tackle him and disarm him.
[02:02:49.459 --> 02:02:51.080]  The other thing is the fire extinguishers.
[02:02:51.461 --> 02:02:54.843]  Being a former university cop, I've been in a couple of fire extinguisher fights.
[02:02:55.223 --> 02:02:56.785]  You can't see anything.
[02:02:56.825 --> 02:03:01.568]  You deprive everyone within, you know, a good 50, 60 yards of sight.
[02:03:01.908 --> 02:03:05.511]  And you're breathing in this dry chemical powder, which makes it very uncomfortable.
[02:03:06.052 --> 02:03:13.868]  And if you can't see and you can't walk, you don't even have to be in the line of fire to wet down the floors adjacent to where this guy wants to move.
[02:03:14.238 --> 02:03:16.339]  And to make walls of smoke that he can't see.
[02:03:16.379 --> 02:03:17.200]  You know the buildings.
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:18.220]  You're in there every day.
[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:19.201]  He's helpless.
[02:03:19.641 --> 02:03:26.024]  Well, I'm not going to say I'm a tough guy, but I guarantee you I'd crouch down behind something and just wait for him to come by.
[02:03:26.064 --> 02:03:28.385]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:03:28.925 --> 02:03:30.666]  Sure, I know this too.
[02:03:30.726 --> 02:03:32.207]  I'd ram out those windows and get out.
[02:03:32.247 --> 02:03:33.267]  I agree with those kids.
[02:03:33.327 --> 02:03:34.468]  Jumping out and breaking their legs.
[02:03:34.508 --> 02:03:34.848]  So what?
[02:03:34.868 --> 02:03:35.409]  They got out.
[02:03:35.769 --> 02:03:36.189]  Stay there.
[02:03:36.269 --> 02:03:40.371]  Walk through this with us as a retired or former university police officer.
[02:03:40.731 --> 02:03:41.812]  On the other side, a police officer.
[02:03:41.832 --> 02:03:42.212]  Stay with us.
[02:03:47.330 --> 02:03:52.775]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:53.135 --> 02:04:00.742]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:01.471 --> 02:04:08.534]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:08.934 --> 02:04:20.379]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:20.659 --> 02:04:24.601]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:24.621 --> 02:04:26.562]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:26.882 --> 02:04:30.724]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:46.972 --> 02:04:49.753]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:04:50.033 --> 02:04:54.195]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:04:54.615 --> 02:04:55.456]  So what do you do?
[02:04:55.756 --> 02:05:00.318]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:05:00.798 --> 02:05:02.939]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:05:03.420 --> 02:05:18.128]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:05:43.911 --> 02:05:46.835]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:05:46.996 --> 02:05:52.223]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:05:52.544 --> 02:05:57.832]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:05:58.232 --> 02:05:59.334]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:59.714 --> 02:06:08.781]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:06:09.041 --> 02:06:10.642]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[02:06:44.511 --> 02:06:46.773]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:06:47.333 --> 02:06:50.136]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:00.188 --> 02:07:12.086]  Alright, we're talking to a former university police officer, George in Canada.
[02:07:12.126 --> 02:07:13.509]  We got a Richard Todd.
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:18.422]  Harold and many, many others that are patiently holding Lewis and others.
[02:07:19.243 --> 02:07:21.964]  But for those that just joined us, walk back through.
[02:07:21.984 --> 02:07:25.226]  We all know this isn't standard procedure.
[02:07:25.267 --> 02:07:31.110]  Just like 9-11 default was to shoot planes down, but then that was reprimanded, I mean that was blocked, countermanded.
[02:07:32.071 --> 02:07:34.052]  We know, I mean this is just insane.
[02:07:34.072 --> 02:07:38.435]  You've got almost two hours after, they've already found, already found, it happened before that, dead bodies.
[02:07:39.230 --> 02:07:40.692]  Nothing's locked down, nothing happens.
[02:07:40.752 --> 02:07:43.855]  It takes them almost two hours to even tell people something's going on.
[02:07:44.215 --> 02:07:46.778]  Sirens go on an hour and fifty-something minutes after.
[02:07:46.798 --> 02:07:50.341]  And then still it takes hours for the cops to even go in and help the bleeding.
[02:07:50.862 --> 02:07:52.183]  I've never seen anything like this.
[02:07:52.263 --> 02:07:55.627]  I mean, I guess Columbine actually, four hours, fifteen minutes there.
[02:07:57.188 --> 02:07:58.049]  Walk through it for us.
[02:07:59.050 --> 02:08:02.614]  That only tells us one thing, and that's pretty much that it's being allowed to happen.
[02:08:03.255 --> 02:08:15.409]  When they had the Montreal Massacre, the Ecole Polytechnique in Canada many, many long years ago with the infamous gunman Mark Lapine, the officers who were first on site were ordered not to intervene.
[02:08:15.469 --> 02:08:17.571]  They were told to stay outside and wait.
[02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:20.041]  And they were probably chomping at the bit.
[02:08:20.161 --> 02:08:21.742]  And I was just shocked myself.
[02:08:21.882 --> 02:08:23.282]  But I wouldn't follow that order.
[02:08:23.342 --> 02:08:25.743]  In fact, that order is unlawful.
[02:08:26.103 --> 02:08:27.644]  You've signed on to protect people.
[02:08:28.324 --> 02:08:30.765]  I mean, would you follow an order if they're in there shooting young people?
[02:08:31.546 --> 02:08:34.287]  That's why I'm a former university police officer, Alex.
[02:08:34.367 --> 02:08:37.488]  I don't obey orders that are like that.
[02:08:38.209 --> 02:08:40.391]  And you're going to catch a lot of heat for it.
[02:08:40.411 --> 02:08:47.196]  Now, do you think the person was just a complete ninny, and knew nothing about it, or do you think it was a black op then?
[02:08:47.696 --> 02:08:49.357]  I think it was a black op then.
[02:08:49.518 --> 02:08:52.400]  At the time I didn't realize that, I wasn't that politically aware.
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:59.385]  But as it stands now, the parallels are so common in each one of these shootings, you can write the script in advance.
[02:08:59.895 --> 02:09:04.417]  So I have no doubt in my mind that this... Well, that's how I went on air before I knew any details.
[02:09:05.077 --> 02:09:06.858]  That's why I went on air before I had any details.
[02:09:06.878 --> 02:09:11.039]  The network where I started the show told me, and I started talking, and it turned out to be exactly what it was.
[02:09:11.079 --> 02:09:11.960]  It's always a script!
[02:09:11.980 --> 02:09:13.220]  I mean, my God, it never stops!
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:14.120]  Exactly.
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:21.023]  One of the most important things to remember with these types of individuals is they need to have complete and total power and control.
[02:09:21.483 --> 02:09:29.146]  As soon as they start to lose power and control, they immediately revert to suicide mode, because they can't take the chance that they'll be wounded or captured.
[02:09:29.795 --> 02:09:36.080]  So the faster that you can take back something from them, that's why it's very important with using the firefighting equipment.
[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:37.541]  You take away the ability to see.
[02:09:37.561 --> 02:09:39.923]  You take away the ability to run or to move.
[02:09:40.284 --> 02:09:42.505]  Even if you pull the fire alarm, it makes a lot of noise.
[02:09:42.545 --> 02:09:44.227]  He can't hear who's coming up on him.
[02:09:44.627 --> 02:09:45.688]  He loses control.
[02:09:45.768 --> 02:09:48.450]  So he has to revert to suicide mode very, very quickly.
[02:09:48.730 --> 02:09:53.114]  And you're going to see these people come completely unglued and fall apart, which is what you want.
[02:09:53.550 --> 02:09:59.933]  We've been conditioned by administrations and governments to surrender to these people and allow them to have the power and control.
[02:10:00.633 --> 02:10:01.073]  Wrong, though.
[02:10:01.113 --> 02:10:02.454]  It's like you said at the very beginning.
[02:10:02.514 --> 02:10:05.515]  And that's what these drills are training us how to surrender.
[02:10:06.116 --> 02:10:06.536]  Exactly.
[02:10:06.596 --> 02:10:07.356]  Never surrender.
[02:10:07.396 --> 02:10:08.117]  Counterattack.
[02:10:08.177 --> 02:10:09.357]  That's what made your nation.
[02:10:09.677 --> 02:10:10.858]  That's what made my nation.
[02:10:10.898 --> 02:10:12.659]  My grandfather was a D-Day veteran.
[02:10:13.219 --> 02:10:17.841]  And even as a very old man, some guy tried to mug him on the streetcar in Toronto.
[02:10:18.582 --> 02:10:28.527]  In his seventies, he picked a guy up with two fingers and a carotid pinch, punched him in the face, broke his nose, knocked out all his front teeth, and it was probably so fast the guy didn't even know what happened.
[02:10:29.588 --> 02:10:34.851]  You know, the police were laughing so hard that, you know, here's a guy trying to go after a helpless senior citizen.
[02:10:34.871 --> 02:10:37.952]  Well, we see 80-year-old women fighting back, too, but not our young people.
[02:10:37.972 --> 02:10:38.793]  They're just jelly!
[02:10:39.406 --> 02:10:44.528]  They're jelly, and it's time that we have to train and condition ourselves to say we're citizens in a free country.
[02:10:44.868 --> 02:10:46.209]  We have the right to self-defense.
[02:10:46.229 --> 02:10:49.450]  But listen, I keep saying this because I can't understand it.
[02:10:50.010 --> 02:10:53.972]  My instinct is I can't control myself if somebody's trying to attack me.
[02:10:54.052 --> 02:10:56.253]  I want to attack them.
[02:10:56.573 --> 02:10:58.194]  It's like a gravity or something.
[02:10:58.254 --> 02:11:02.035]  I don't understand how people can just sit there and kneel down so you can get shot in the head.
[02:11:02.876 --> 02:11:08.498]  Well, you have to, even if you are afraid, you're going to be afraid, but you have to understand that
[02:11:09.099 --> 02:11:16.729]  If all these people counter-attacked at once, like you said, some would die, some would be wounded, but 95% would have walked away uninjured.
[02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:22.957]  And there's no way one person or even a small group of people can do that much to such a large number of people.
[02:11:23.607 --> 02:11:26.709]  Without their consent by just actively being passive.
[02:11:26.809 --> 02:11:40.496]  Well, every few months we hear about some 10-year-old girl or a 25-year-old woman who the guy grabs her, says, get in the car, she claws his face, he tries to drag her in, she kicks, she runs, he shoots, he misses, she gets away.
[02:11:40.876 --> 02:11:46.279]  But in every case, I mean almost every case, when you get in and go, they dig you up 10 years later in the back of a yard.
[02:11:47.072 --> 02:11:53.775]  And, you know, the cases of little kids that do do what their parents say, and they scream and yell and dodge and yell and run off.
[02:11:54.295 --> 02:11:56.716]  But a lot of little kids, you see them, they walk up, they tell them something.
[02:11:56.736 --> 02:12:00.418]  You've seen the surveillance camera that happened down here in Austin.
[02:12:00.438 --> 02:12:01.318]  They've shown video of it.
[02:12:01.518 --> 02:12:02.859]  We've all seen the video in other areas.
[02:12:03.119 --> 02:12:04.540]  And the person just gets in the car.
[02:12:04.700 --> 02:12:06.060]  Oh, it just tears my guts out.
[02:12:06.921 --> 02:12:12.283]  Well, another point I'd like to bring up that's been brought up on CNN yesterday when they interviewed the university administrators.
[02:12:12.814 --> 02:12:16.537]  They're a weird duck, these university administrators.
[02:12:16.817 --> 02:12:19.379]  They're the ultimate in spineless and gutless and manipulative.
[02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:21.781]  Oh, I know, did you hear how he talked real soft?
[02:12:21.861 --> 02:12:22.762]  It was all Delphi.
[02:12:23.002 --> 02:12:24.683]  For those who don't know, folks, they actually teach you.
[02:12:24.703 --> 02:12:33.530]  That's why when you go to these events, they'll talk, well, you know, what we're doing is trying with the policy.
[02:12:33.771 --> 02:12:35.472]  There's a whole cadence to it.
[02:12:36.805 --> 02:12:38.406]  Wasn't it sick watching that guy?
[02:12:38.846 --> 02:12:40.167]  Well, I've seen so many of them.
[02:12:40.227 --> 02:12:42.629]  I read between his lines very, very quickly.
[02:12:43.329 --> 02:12:44.970]  Universities are very political things.
[02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:53.416]  We had a murder at the university I worked at before I got there, and I was very familiar with the circumstances behind it because it was a fundamental one of our training processes.
[02:12:54.197 --> 02:12:57.639]  And when this girl went missing, they didn't report it.
[02:12:57.939 --> 02:12:59.881]  They let her stay missing for several days.
[02:13:00.361 --> 02:13:04.604]  Our police went out and started searching for her on their own without any orders or instruction.
[02:13:05.017 --> 02:13:07.799]  And they virtually covered 95% of the campus.
[02:13:07.819 --> 02:13:11.141]  So when it finally came up that the parents were screaming, where's my daughter?
[02:13:12.642 --> 02:13:15.263]  At least we could say, well, we've covered this much.
[02:13:15.383 --> 02:13:18.065]  There's only a few small pieces of real estate left.
[02:13:18.225 --> 02:13:20.607]  And that's exactly where her body was found.
[02:13:20.987 --> 02:13:25.310]  But they don't want any bad press or bad attention brought to their school.
[02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:31.673]  So they'll do things that are totally bizarre and not normal business or government practices to achieve these objectives.
[02:13:32.014 --> 02:13:34.075]  So I imagine when they had the first homicide,
[02:13:34.448 --> 02:13:35.108]  They didn't want it.
[02:13:35.248 --> 02:13:45.810]  It's bad enough that they've got some bad press, but they don't want to blow it out of proportion that they actually have to shut down the school or just put every radio and TV station on alert to close the school.
[02:13:46.110 --> 02:13:51.371]  If you had a snowstorm, the whole education system can be shut down with a few phone calls.
[02:13:51.771 --> 02:14:00.093]  I find it unfathomable that in a serious, life-threatening situation like this, that that same policy and procedure that exists to inform the media
[02:14:00.455 --> 02:14:13.980]  That any campus or public education facility is closed because of events of weather or whatever, that this couldn't be implemented to say the school is shut down because of a dangerous incident and everyone has to stay home.
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:18.181]  And with a series of 12 or 15 roadblocks, that school isn't that big.
[02:14:18.201 --> 02:14:18.942]  I looked at a map.
[02:14:19.262 --> 02:14:22.263]  There's only so many points of egress on the property.
[02:14:22.679 --> 02:14:26.240]  It was probably more than enough, which is the local law enforcement, never mind county.
[02:14:26.300 --> 02:14:27.560]  And then the cops show up.
[02:14:27.580 --> 02:14:30.921]  Did you see how the cops just showed up hours into it and just stood there?
[02:14:30.941 --> 02:14:31.741]  Yeah.
[02:14:31.801 --> 02:14:34.022]  Well, I pointed that out to my girlfriend.
[02:14:34.082 --> 02:14:37.503]  You know, I said, look at them cowering and hiding behind the car.
[02:14:37.543 --> 02:14:40.803]  If the building was on fire, the fire department is going to run in there.
[02:14:41.044 --> 02:14:41.884]  They're going to get burned.
[02:14:42.064 --> 02:14:43.044]  They're going to fall down.
[02:14:43.404 --> 02:14:44.824]  Some of the guys are going to have smoking.
[02:14:44.884 --> 02:14:46.885]  And that's why they're tough guys and people like them.
[02:14:47.609 --> 02:14:49.230]  I mean, they signed on for that.
[02:14:49.490 --> 02:14:50.851]  You signed on to save your life.
[02:14:51.131 --> 02:14:52.371]  Yeah, I mean, exactly.
[02:14:52.612 --> 02:14:54.973]  Some of the few public servants left are our firefighters.
[02:14:55.733 --> 02:15:00.836]  And they'll also go to these schools in advance, because our local fire department did that all the time.
[02:15:01.236 --> 02:15:05.018]  If it's a slow day, or they had some new guys in the station, they'd come by.
[02:15:05.258 --> 02:15:12.362]  We want to take out a set of keys and go wander around and get familiar with the layout of the buildings, because, of course, when they go into these buildings, they're full of smoke.
[02:15:12.762 --> 02:15:14.943]  So you have to know how to move around in very
[02:15:15.379 --> 02:15:18.041]  Dark or difficult circumstances.
[02:15:18.061 --> 02:15:19.161]  And they did this routinely.
[02:15:19.201 --> 02:15:20.722]  They never had to be told where to go.
[02:15:21.143 --> 02:15:24.105]  You'd never ever see the police coming in advance to take orders.
[02:15:24.125 --> 02:15:24.905]  Maybe that's the answer.
[02:15:24.945 --> 02:15:26.926]  Next time there's a school shooting, send in the firemen.
[02:15:27.647 --> 02:15:29.428]  Well, you can use that equipment yourself.
[02:15:29.508 --> 02:15:31.389]  I guarantee you can't run on a wet floor.
[02:15:31.709 --> 02:15:35.892]  And if you've never had an inhaled dry chemical fire extinguisher, you can't see.
[02:15:36.377 --> 02:15:46.800]  The only thing you travel to, how we arrested some of these characters, was to follow the noise, because you're just totally blinded, and you're breathing in material that's like talcum powder, so it's not very pleasant.
[02:15:47.260 --> 02:15:48.620]  Tell me the story.
[02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:51.101]  When did you use a fire extinguisher on someone?
[02:15:51.121 --> 02:15:53.041]  A lot of vandals would do that from time to time.
[02:15:53.061 --> 02:15:55.302]  They'd take the fire extinguishers and just spray them around.
[02:15:56.857 --> 02:16:00.318]  So you'd have to operate in circumstances that were very, very difficult.
[02:16:00.618 --> 02:16:01.939]  But these things are available.
[02:16:01.959 --> 02:16:03.159]  They're in every public building.
[02:16:03.459 --> 02:16:14.882]  And an assassin who can't see and can't run, because floors are slippery, or even better, if you guys on the football team blast him with a few heavy lines as he comes around the corner, it'll blow you right through a brick wall almost.
[02:16:15.323 --> 02:16:17.063]  There's amazing power in those hoses.
[02:16:17.563 --> 02:16:18.584]  And you're not helpless.
[02:16:18.984 --> 02:16:20.764]  But it turns the power away from him.
[02:16:20.824 --> 02:16:24.105]  Psychologically, he has to break down, because he no longer has power.
[02:16:24.145 --> 02:16:25.386]  He no longer has control.
[02:16:25.626 --> 02:16:26.686]  He's trapped like a rat.
[02:16:27.190 --> 02:16:30.752]  And he has to go either into suicide mode or roll up in a ball and start crying.
[02:16:30.772 --> 02:16:38.775]  Do you think that the school administrators, the head of the school who had this gun ban and had everybody stand down like this, do you think that Peg needs to be arrested?
[02:16:39.916 --> 02:16:52.582]  I would love to have the opportunity to go through all the secret files, whether it be in the government or that university, and find out exactly what really happened there because... Now we're learning he's had some tie-in with Homeland Security.
[02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:54.741]  Tell me I'm surprised.
[02:17:04.864 --> 02:17:08.845]  So I smell that this was a black ops from the get-go with the gun bill.
[02:17:08.885 --> 02:17:11.886]  Yeah, we need to have the listeners, because you've got the manpower, folks.
[02:17:11.906 --> 02:17:13.847]  We're trying it right now, but you always help us.
[02:17:13.867 --> 02:17:14.907]  You guys do most of it.
[02:17:15.408 --> 02:17:21.630]  Start searching all these school administrators' names, the police chief, the head of the university police, the local police chief.
[02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:25.831]  You're going to find that they're former FBI, former BATF, ADL people.
[02:17:26.311 --> 02:17:27.912]  I mean, it's just always the same story.
[02:17:28.752 --> 02:17:29.452]  Watch.
[02:17:29.973 --> 02:17:30.813]  Just watch.
[02:17:31.253 --> 02:17:31.673]  Go look.
[02:17:31.733 --> 02:17:33.534]  I mean, what do you want to bet, George?
[02:17:33.574 --> 02:17:34.274]  That's what we're going to find.
[02:17:35.109 --> 02:17:35.789]  I guarantee it.
[02:17:36.270 --> 02:17:45.535]  Another thing, if I have a few seconds to bring up a listener who sent me an email on a BBC documentary called The Power of Nightmares, is a must-see.
[02:17:46.336 --> 02:17:48.897]  It's a couple hours long, but it is incredibly powerful.
[02:17:48.917 --> 02:17:49.597]  Three hour, one hour parts.
[02:17:49.998 --> 02:17:57.262]  Should we be worried about the threat from organized terrorism, or is it simply a phantom menace being used to stop society from falling apart?
[02:17:57.762 --> 02:18:04.226]  And you can see how the neocons were trained in these tactics and procedures in the 1960s and their university days.
[02:18:04.798 --> 02:18:05.639]  It is a must-see.
[02:18:05.719 --> 02:18:06.179]  Google it.
[02:18:06.639 --> 02:18:07.640]  Find it however you can.
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:10.081]  It is on archive.org or something like that.
[02:18:10.121 --> 02:18:10.442]  I hear you.
[02:18:10.462 --> 02:18:11.062]  We got a job.
[02:18:11.102 --> 02:18:12.023]  Good to hear from you.
[02:18:12.063 --> 02:18:13.343]  Stuff develops in the next few days.
[02:18:13.363 --> 02:18:13.904]  Give us a call.
[02:18:13.924 --> 02:18:15.085]  Alright.
[02:18:15.125 --> 02:18:16.125]  Now, I said I'd get to your calls.
[02:18:16.145 --> 02:18:17.026]  We will get now.
[02:18:17.046 --> 02:18:18.267]  Richard was on for two seconds.
[02:18:18.287 --> 02:18:19.007]  He had a lot to add.
[02:18:19.067 --> 02:18:20.688]  Thank you, George.
[02:18:21.088 --> 02:18:24.370]  Next is Richard, then Ted, then a lot of other folks.
[02:18:24.391 --> 02:18:24.451]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:18:27.433 --> 02:18:29.735]  And, uh, I do have a bunch of other news I'm going to go over.
[02:18:29.755 --> 02:18:31.876]  I'm going to kind of recap the top issues with this.
[02:18:32.236 --> 02:18:35.018]  We've got to push now and point out this was victim disarmament.
[02:18:35.238 --> 02:18:37.079]  This is the fault of the gun grabbers.
[02:18:37.359 --> 02:18:38.280]  This is their fault.
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:39.360]  They're going to try to blame us.
[02:18:39.561 --> 02:18:41.782]  They're calling for gun control right now in Reuters.
[02:18:46.101 --> 02:18:50.603]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:18:50.943 --> 02:18:55.025]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:18:55.325 --> 02:18:55.865]  We listened.
[02:18:56.185 --> 02:19:01.148]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:19:01.448 --> 02:19:01.928]  We listened.
[02:19:02.308 --> 02:19:05.329]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:19:05.770 --> 02:19:06.310]  We listened.
[02:19:06.770 --> 02:19:08.791]  You asked us to include an emergency light for
[02:19:08.831 --> 02:19:09.592]  We're good to go.
[02:19:27.191 --> 02:19:29.812]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[02:19:30.032 --> 02:19:30.232]  Only $279.
[02:19:30.293 --> 02:19:30.873]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:19:30.913 --> 02:19:31.153]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:19:31.213 --> 02:19:32.834]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:19:32.854 --> 02:19:33.814]  Now yet available in Iowa.
[02:19:43.994 --> 02:19:45.915]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[02:19:46.175 --> 02:19:48.796]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[02:19:49.116 --> 02:19:57.420]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[02:19:57.720 --> 02:20:00.061]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[02:20:00.722 --> 02:20:04.604]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[02:20:05.924 --> 02:20:07.505]  How much are you willing to lose?
[02:20:07.905 --> 02:20:08.826]  Take action now!
[02:20:08.966 --> 02:20:12.869]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[02:20:13.789 --> 02:20:17.532]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[02:20:17.772 --> 02:20:20.974]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[02:20:21.094 --> 02:20:27.519]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[02:20:27.819 --> 02:20:33.364]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[02:20:33.785 --> 02:20:35.887]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[02:20:36.107 --> 02:20:41.332]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[02:20:43.354 --> 02:20:49.379]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:20:49.940 --> 02:20:51.081]  Globalists are concerned with
[02:20:57.688 --> 02:20:58.028]  We're good.
[02:21:16.733 --> 02:21:16.953]  We're good.
[02:21:45.140 --> 02:21:49.282]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:21:49.502 --> 02:21:51.263]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:21:51.523 --> 02:21:57.805]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:21:58.106 --> 02:22:04.228]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:22:04.468 --> 02:22:10.491]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[02:22:10.791 --> 02:22:17.194]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[02:22:17.334 --> 02:22:20.875]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[02:22:21.176 --> 02:22:24.897]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[02:22:25.077 --> 02:22:27.618]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:22:27.738 --> 02:22:28.799]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:22:28.999 --> 02:22:29.920]  This is not America
[02:22:59.576 --> 02:23:02.904]  A little piece of me
[02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:13.752]  Mike Rivero just popping in.
[02:23:13.772 --> 02:23:17.295]  I just wanted to get his quick take because he's been doing some great coverage of WhatReallyHappened.com.
[02:23:17.315 --> 02:23:19.357]  We know Columbine had Black Op written on it.
[02:23:19.717 --> 02:23:23.341]  We know the Buford-Furrow Jewish Center had it written all over it.
[02:23:23.821 --> 02:23:28.005]  We know some of this stuff's real, though, and it's just nuts, but Mike, it's just in two minutes.
[02:23:28.045 --> 02:23:28.926]  I won't take much of your time.
[02:23:28.966 --> 02:23:35.952]  I know you're busy on some big things, but real fast, just give us your take on the mass shooting.
[02:23:37.046 --> 02:23:41.213]  Well, taking it all at face value, I think there's a very obvious lesson here.
[02:23:41.874 --> 02:23:49.405]  There was a gun ban in effect at Virginia Tech, and it basically restricted the victims of their ability to defend themselves.
[02:23:49.966 --> 02:23:51.588]  The police couldn't defend them.
[02:23:51.628 --> 02:24:00.278]  The police were there for two hours following the morning shooting, standing around in their Nomex and carrying their M16, and still couldn't prevent the afternoon horror.
[02:24:01.119 --> 02:24:10.750]  And I think if you look at the Appalachian Law School shooting from 2002, where a runaway shooter was stopped by students using legally owned firearms,
[02:24:11.230 --> 02:24:29.563]  I think this really puts the nail in the coffin of the theory that gun bans are going to make anybody safer, because these 33 students at Virginia Tech are dead because of the gun ban, because they couldn't defend themselves, because they trusted the police to defend themselves, to defend them, and the police just failed miserably.
[02:24:29.603 --> 02:24:39.510]  So even if it isn't some type of foul play black op, it's still the government's fault that it was this wide for prohibiting self-defense, the most basic of rights?
[02:24:40.214 --> 02:24:42.476]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:24:42.496 --> 02:24:50.843]  This idea that gun bans are going to stop guns makes as much sense as the claim that heroin bans are going to stop the drug traffic or cocaine bans are going to stop crack.
[02:24:50.863 --> 02:24:51.624]  It doesn't work.
[02:24:51.804 --> 02:24:57.228]  All it does is make sure that only the criminals have to ban whatever it is, whether it's drugs or guns.
[02:24:57.689 --> 02:25:02.373]  Mike, I know I just had you on last week, but you're going to be popping in, visiting with us later in the week.
[02:25:02.753 --> 02:25:04.955]  I really appreciate you joining us.
[02:25:05.035 --> 02:25:06.276]  Mike Rivera, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:25:07.003 --> 02:25:07.704]  Thanks a lot, pal.
[02:25:18.300 --> 02:25:19.081]  Hi, Alex.
[02:25:19.381 --> 02:25:32.011]  It is amazing how convenient the timing of this is for so many different issues for the government, whether it be the Gonzales thing, or promotion of gun control issues, or distraction from the other news that's going on.
[02:25:32.071 --> 02:25:33.572]  Yeah, I have the AP, for those that don't know.
[02:25:33.612 --> 02:25:35.253]  They've cancelled the Gonzales hearings.
[02:25:35.273 --> 02:25:36.114]  They've not reset them.
[02:25:36.434 --> 02:25:37.315]  They've just cancelled them.
[02:25:37.375 --> 02:25:38.676]  Oh, the whole world's changed!
[02:25:39.016 --> 02:25:40.637]  Oh my gosh, 33 people dead!
[02:25:41.077 --> 02:25:44.260]  Meanwhile, that many die in a major state every day on the highways.
[02:25:45.020 --> 02:25:49.204]  Well, we need Mr. Torture to stay up there and take full advantage of this, I suppose.
[02:25:49.584 --> 02:25:56.791]  Alex, there's also an article that's been posted by the Chicago Tribune that seems to be bearing out one of your prophecies about this.
[02:25:57.372 --> 02:25:58.773]  It's on the Rents site as well.
[02:25:59.654 --> 02:26:04.078]  It's titled on the Tribune, College Gunman Left Notes.
[02:26:04.538 --> 02:26:13.569]  And there is various vindictive comments in there about rich kids, debauchery on campus, deceitful charlatans, and that sort of thing.
[02:26:13.869 --> 02:26:18.995]  But it does go on to say that apparently he was a pretty disturbed, very quiet, unfriendly type.
[02:26:19.395 --> 02:26:22.317]  It was receiving some form of counseling at school.
[02:26:23.158 --> 02:26:27.000]  The next thing will be, you know, the antidepressants will come forward.
[02:26:27.020 --> 02:26:34.766]  And it'll be, oh, the psychiatrist he saw before he came to school a year ago was a former colonel in mind control operations.
[02:26:34.986 --> 02:26:36.147]  And I mean, I'm not kidding.
[02:26:36.187 --> 02:26:37.088]  It's always like that.
[02:26:37.888 --> 02:26:39.469]  Or he was in a special NASA program.
[02:26:39.489 --> 02:26:46.074]  It's amazing how they can continue to get away with this stuff when they pull it off in the same, you know, modus operandi for all these things.
[02:26:47.109 --> 02:26:48.410]  Well, it's the same thing at Columbine.
[02:26:48.450 --> 02:26:53.772]  They've got to contain it, let the shootings go on, tell the cops to wait while their black operators get out.
[02:26:53.812 --> 02:26:55.973]  The mental patient has shot a few people, generally.
[02:26:56.513 --> 02:26:58.014]  They'll have some surveillance tape of him.
[02:26:58.034 --> 02:27:01.315]  I don't have time to go over it.
[02:27:01.355 --> 02:27:02.095]  We will tomorrow.
[02:27:02.115 --> 02:27:03.736]  I'm going to pull it all, make some notes, do it.
[02:27:04.638 --> 02:27:07.721]  But we'll do a column by an hour and go over it.
[02:27:07.761 --> 02:27:09.682]  I mean, it's just off the charts, my friend.
[02:27:09.862 --> 02:27:24.154]  On this tribute site, they also show two cops on a video there that are lurking behind a tree, you know, waiting for some possible shot at this killer, which, you know, that's clearly ridiculous in terms of trying to really think you're going to have an impact on stopping this thing.
[02:27:24.174 --> 02:27:27.957]  Well, even a great shot, if they were laying up on top of a building, a sniper,
[02:27:28.717 --> 02:27:32.438]  You know, it's hard to shoot through windows and get people and even know who you're getting if you're the best shot.
[02:27:32.799 --> 02:27:34.239]  Now, this calls for manhood.
[02:27:35.099 --> 02:27:40.181]  It calls for driving the armored vehicle through the door and going in there and killing the guy.
[02:27:41.061 --> 02:27:45.783]  Well, I sure hope we've got some of those folks that are on our side that think that way, Alex, because it's all coming down.
[02:27:46.643 --> 02:27:51.825]  There's a lot of good cops, but I mean, even a good cop who follows bad orders is a cowardly piece of filth.
[02:27:52.375 --> 02:28:01.603]  Well, I'm just talking about the people on the right side of this, you know, truth issues and all the rest of the anti-corruption stuff are going to stand up when the time comes and be brave about it.
[02:28:03.064 --> 02:28:04.665]  Well, we are going to be brave.
[02:28:04.685 --> 02:28:07.888]  We have been brave and our numbers are growing and we're going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:28:07.948 --> 02:28:08.669]  Thanks for the call.
[02:28:09.549 --> 02:28:13.152]  I'll keep blitzing through calls, cover some international news as well, kind of recap this.
[02:28:14.580 --> 02:28:21.682]  Tomorrow I am going to do some, I've done all the research, I've done 50 shows probably on it, back when it happened, but I'm going to go recodify.
[02:28:21.702 --> 02:28:28.424]  The problem is there's so much evidence of call-a-bye being an inside job that you can't do justice just saying it and mentioning a few reasons.
[02:28:28.924 --> 02:28:30.144]  Wait until you hear a couple hundred.
[02:28:30.724 --> 02:28:33.765]  See?
[02:28:34.725 --> 02:28:35.665]  We're on the march.
[02:28:36.126 --> 02:28:37.746]  The empire's on the run.
[02:28:38.646 --> 02:28:41.327]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:44.694 --> 02:28:45.515]  Attention gardeners!
[02:28:45.595 --> 02:28:47.956]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[02:28:48.176 --> 02:28:52.519]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[02:28:52.720 --> 02:29:00.585]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[02:29:00.905 --> 02:29:03.749]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[02:29:04.030 --> 02:29:11.581]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[02:29:11.681 --> 02:29:17.249]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[02:29:17.469 --> 02:29:23.032]  ProtoGro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[02:29:23.312 --> 02:29:26.634]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[02:29:26.874 --> 02:29:30.235]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[02:29:30.455 --> 02:29:35.498]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dervsheet superfoods should visit the ProtoGro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[02:29:35.518 --> 02:29:38.399]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:29:38.439 --> 02:29:38.639]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:29:44.935 --> 02:29:47.637]  Automakers in the oil industry are in a fuel fight.
[02:29:48.018 --> 02:29:51.020]  Automakers claim gasoline quality doesn't measure up.
[02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:53.362]  Is your vehicle performing like it should?
[02:29:53.702 --> 02:29:58.066]  Now there's SFR Green, performance technologies for a clean planet.
[02:29:58.326 --> 02:30:04.631]  SFR Green's Protector reduces emissions and improves fuel economy, meeting automakers' new standards.
[02:30:04.651 --> 02:30:05.712]  So do something green.
[02:30:05.932 --> 02:30:10.016]  For a special offer with free shipping, go to GreenGasAdditive.com.
[02:30:10.316 --> 02:30:13.439]  Or to locate a retailer, go to GreenGasAdditive.com.
[02:30:15.427 --> 02:30:17.908]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[02:30:18.368 --> 02:30:20.269]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[02:30:20.989 --> 02:30:24.171]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:30:24.811 --> 02:30:31.293]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[02:30:32.074 --> 02:30:34.275]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[02:30:34.655 --> 02:30:35.075]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:30:35.175 --> 02:30:36.556]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:30:44.557 --> 02:30:48.599]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:30:48.819 --> 02:30:52.221]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:30:52.381 --> 02:30:55.882]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:30:56.122 --> 02:30:59.344]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:30:59.364 --> 02:31:04.886]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:31:04.906 --> 02:31:10.069]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal form it's like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[02:31:10.769 --> 02:31:11.170]  Thank you!
[02:31:27.992 --> 02:31:31.854]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:31:31.914 --> 02:31:32.654]  That toll free number again?
[02:31:32.674 --> 02:31:32.734]  1-877-928-8822.
[02:31:47.943 --> 02:31:49.084]  Get your arms!
[02:31:49.164 --> 02:31:51.846]  Get down on the ground!
[02:31:51.946 --> 02:31:54.607]  We have to put a protest in a building!
[02:32:24.853 --> 02:32:31.239]  I see a message from the government like every day.
[02:32:31.519 --> 02:32:34.082]  I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[02:32:34.362 --> 02:32:36.444]  They're warning me about Osama or whatever.
[02:32:36.684 --> 02:32:38.345]  Picture me buying the scam.
[02:32:38.385 --> 02:32:39.186]  I said never.
[02:32:39.606 --> 02:32:42.049]  You in tune to a hard truth soldier spitting.
[02:32:42.269 --> 02:32:43.390]  I say commit it, give it to me.
[02:32:43.690 --> 02:32:45.230]  Why don't you do it, dude?
[02:33:24.637 --> 02:33:25.158]  I think so.
[02:33:31.776 --> 02:33:34.238]  Now ask yourself, who's the one with the most to gain?
[02:33:34.438 --> 02:33:36.840]  On 9-11, most people couldn't stand his name.
[02:33:36.940 --> 02:33:39.603]  Now even now, he's waving flags like they lost their mind.
[02:33:39.823 --> 02:33:42.085]  Everybody got opinions, but don't know the time.
[02:33:42.345 --> 02:33:44.787]  Cause America's been took, it's plain to see.
[02:33:44.827 --> 02:33:47.129]  The oldest trick in the book is make your enemy.
[02:33:47.469 --> 02:33:49.811]  A phony evil, so the government can do its dirt.
[02:33:50.091 --> 02:33:52.413]  And take away your freedom, lock and load, beat and search.
[02:33:52.553 --> 02:33:55.156]  Ain't nothing changed, but more colored people locked in prison.
[02:33:55.176 --> 02:33:57.738]  These pigs still beat us, but it seems we forgetting.
[02:33:57.898 --> 02:34:00.260]  But I remember 4 September, how these devils do it.
[02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:03.681]  Alright, we're back live and I'm down to play the whole song.
[02:34:29.446 --> 02:34:30.768]  It's Paris, what would you do?
[02:34:30.788 --> 02:34:35.654]  Uh, let's, uh, well, let's continue with your calls for a little while.
[02:34:35.674 --> 02:34:40.660]  I'm gonna get into all the calls for gun control and... When is it not bad enough?
[02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:42.823]  Take them, save us!
[02:34:44.765 --> 02:34:46.746]  Again, I'm going to put a call out to the listeners right now.
[02:34:46.806 --> 02:34:47.567]  I know you're smart.
[02:34:47.627 --> 02:34:48.487]  I know you're intelligent.
[02:34:48.547 --> 02:34:49.787]  We need to get all the points out.
[02:34:50.168 --> 02:34:51.408]  My writers can't do it all.
[02:34:51.468 --> 02:34:55.030]  I want you to write articles up with the facts, short ones, comments, whatever.
[02:34:55.050 --> 02:34:57.431]  E-mail them to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:57.451 --> 02:34:59.631]  We'll post them on JonesReport.com.
[02:35:00.352 --> 02:35:02.613]  E-mail them to Watson at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:35:03.533 --> 02:35:09.215]  Get them to us here at the office because it is so important.
[02:35:09.235 --> 02:35:12.897]  We'll get them posted where millions can read it so we can get it out there to make every point, every angle.
[02:35:14.342 --> 02:35:20.604]  Plus, let's just point out here, all the points that people have been making here today.
[02:35:20.664 --> 02:35:28.147]  I mean, I need that former police officer, you know, former university police officer, all those points he was making, it needs to be written down and given to us.
[02:35:29.127 --> 02:35:38.711]  Or we need to make the point about, you can go dig up the articles where, you know, a Japanese man goes into a school and kills fifteen five-year-olds with a butcher knife.
[02:35:41.312 --> 02:35:49.298]  Or, you know, German man stabs 20, or woman stabs, you know, 12 on... I'm just throwing out numbers.
[02:35:49.338 --> 02:35:52.980]  I've seen all these articles with similar numbers, you know, on bus in Israel.
[02:35:54.321 --> 02:35:56.422]  Or man beats 5 to death with a baseball bat.
[02:35:56.442 --> 02:35:57.623]  You're not going to stop it!
[02:35:58.083 --> 02:36:01.466]  And they've had plenty of shootings in places where there's almost total gun bans.
[02:36:02.006 --> 02:36:06.309]  In France, another place, they had one big mass shooting in Switzerland at a...
[02:36:09.978 --> 02:36:12.479]  Town Council, that was a really suspicious deal.
[02:36:13.060 --> 02:36:15.881]  Now they're calling for gun control there, where they've got the lowest crime rate in Europe.
[02:36:16.702 --> 02:36:18.323]  Lowest crime rate in the industrialized world, by the way.
[02:36:18.343 --> 02:36:20.744]  Everybody has their automatic weapons, hand grenades, machine guns.
[02:36:21.164 --> 02:36:22.145]  You have to have them all hidden.
[02:36:22.685 --> 02:36:26.327]  So the government does inspections to make sure they can't find them in case there's an invasion.
[02:36:28.728 --> 02:36:29.649]  That's how they get left alone.
[02:36:29.669 --> 02:36:30.749]  They don't have weapons everywhere.
[02:36:30.769 --> 02:36:34.832]  And then they're peaceful, genteel, you know, very cultured people.
[02:36:35.892 --> 02:36:37.973]  But they don't mess around, folks.
[02:36:38.233 --> 02:36:39.094]  They don't mess around.
[02:36:40.037 --> 02:36:40.978]  And they're ready to go to war.
[02:36:59.150 --> 02:37:00.351]  They're all over the place around here.
[02:37:00.691 --> 02:37:01.631]  You just don't mess with them.
[02:37:01.651 --> 02:37:02.752]  Red on yellow kills a fella.
[02:37:03.252 --> 02:37:04.853]  Just leave us alone.
[02:37:05.273 --> 02:37:06.274]  Go about your business.
[02:37:06.394 --> 02:37:12.317]  It's a bunch of lazy scum that want power and don't want to work to build anything where people actually want to be their friends.
[02:37:12.557 --> 02:37:14.198]  They want to strut around and rule us.
[02:37:14.999 --> 02:37:15.679]  That's government.
[02:37:15.699 --> 02:37:16.539]  A bunch of trash.
[02:37:16.579 --> 02:37:19.861]  A bunch of scum who want to attach our wealth with their taxes.
[02:37:20.301 --> 02:37:21.262]  Do you understand?
[02:37:22.907 --> 02:37:24.227]  So we need an article about that.
[02:37:24.267 --> 02:37:33.770]  We need an article about how everybody's been trained to be a coward, and trained to lay down when they're attacked, and trained to call the cops and wait for help, and trained not to defend yourselves.
[02:37:34.251 --> 02:37:51.876]  Every day there's some article where somebody sees somebody getting mugged, or a store being robbed, and somebody comes out of their car and shoots them, and then the police come and arrest them, or it was the case of the 80-something-year-old man, World War II vet, retired railway worker, these guys came in, were trying to rob him, he shot two of them, so the cops went ahead and arrested him.
[02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:55.552]  I mean, you know, they just, they hate our guns, they hate our freedom!
[02:37:56.754 --> 02:37:58.175]  And they want us to be dependent on them.
[02:37:58.295 --> 02:38:02.679]  Bunch of gang members in uniforms, working for big mob bosses, that's all it is.
[02:38:02.699 --> 02:38:06.683]  And I'm not saying there's not good police, but the system's rotten and everybody knows it.
[02:38:09.906 --> 02:38:15.431]  Again, I had the cops right out front of my office arrest one of my employees because he had an expired license.
[02:38:15.711 --> 02:38:18.614]  They just pulled him over, he pulled in, they thought it was suspicious he pulled in here.
[02:38:19.531 --> 02:38:20.071]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:38:41.883 --> 02:38:43.184]  And I just said, my God!
[02:38:43.604 --> 02:38:44.665]  My God!
[02:38:44.685 --> 02:38:47.848]  Vicente Fox came in here almost four years ago.
[02:38:48.448 --> 02:38:50.050]  We bullhorned him and shut down his speech.
[02:38:50.090 --> 02:38:51.751]  That's on PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[02:38:52.712 --> 02:38:57.315]  And he came in here and we shut down his speech out at the Governor's Mansion.
[02:38:57.656 --> 02:39:00.178]  He had to quit giving that for ten seconds because I was bullhorning so loud.
[02:39:00.418 --> 02:39:01.399]  We still had a First Amendment.
[02:39:01.699 --> 02:39:02.840]  We had to sue the state police.
[02:39:02.860 --> 02:39:04.902]  They used to arrest you for bullhorning over there without a permit.
[02:39:05.202 --> 02:39:05.902]  We sued.
[02:39:05.942 --> 02:39:07.343]  They lost a whole bunch of your $100,000.
[02:39:07.384 --> 02:39:07.764]  Each count was $100,000.
[02:39:11.341 --> 02:39:16.643]  And when I say we sued him, a group I was involved with sued him.
[02:39:17.444 --> 02:39:23.086]  We even had a girl go out there with a sign saying, I like Bush, and they wouldn't arrest her when he was governor, but they did other people.
[02:39:24.146 --> 02:39:28.428]  And the jury didn't like him arresting much people in wheelchairs, saying they couldn't protest without a permit.
[02:39:28.468 --> 02:39:33.070]  So they lost about, again, each person they arrested, it was like 20 something, a hundred grand a piece.
[02:39:34.050 --> 02:39:37.832]  And so I got to sit there out up against the gate and bullhorn him and shut that piece of trash down.
[02:39:38.883 --> 02:39:42.667]  But he was there giving awards to the Austin Police Department for not arresting illegals.
[02:39:43.408 --> 02:39:45.411]  I mean, you know, it's just how it works here.
[02:39:45.671 --> 02:39:49.595]  And I'll only illustrate that to show you that this is not, again, to keep you safe.
[02:39:49.615 --> 02:39:51.157]  This is not to do any of this.
[02:39:51.317 --> 02:39:55.242]  They want to tell us we don't have free speech, but they want to tell us the illegal alien can break the law.
[02:39:56.463 --> 02:39:58.005]  And doesn't have to have an ID to get a bank account.
[02:39:58.125 --> 02:39:59.527]  I'm not going to put up with it anymore!
[02:40:00.322 --> 02:40:01.965]  Stop shipping your drugs in, government!
[02:40:02.246 --> 02:40:03.668]  Stop CPSing the kids!
[02:40:04.029 --> 02:40:05.652]  Stop putting mercury in the vaccines!
[02:40:05.933 --> 02:40:06.934]  Stop doing your evil!
[02:40:07.335 --> 02:40:09.700]  Stop carrying out terror attacks, you murderers!
[02:40:10.620 --> 02:40:13.202]  And our government admits they killed our own troops in thousands of experiments.
[02:40:13.663 --> 02:40:20.809]  They admit that the dying Cory Halliburton runs giant child kidnapping rings, and nothing's even being done about it.
[02:40:20.930 --> 02:40:21.750]  Chicago Tribune.
[02:40:22.571 --> 02:40:25.454]  And they've got lobbyists up on Capitol Hill, and trillions are missing from the Pentagon.
[02:40:25.514 --> 02:40:26.375]  It's just totally criminal.
[02:40:26.615 --> 02:40:29.598]  You're illegitimate, you're not real, you don't have authority to tell me jack!
[02:40:30.258 --> 02:40:31.820]  Just shut your filthy mouths!
[02:40:32.200 --> 02:40:33.141]  You're not my government!
[02:40:33.161 --> 02:40:35.043]  It's called the Declaration of Independence!
[02:40:35.063 --> 02:40:36.364]  Have you figured it out yet?
[02:40:38.354 --> 02:40:40.275]  Alright, I said I'd go to your calls and get to all this news.
[02:40:40.455 --> 02:40:41.455]  Let's move quickly here.
[02:40:41.496 --> 02:40:41.856]  Todd?
[02:40:42.516 --> 02:40:43.136]  Is Todd next?
[02:40:44.537 --> 02:40:45.978]  And Harold, Arkansas, Lucas, and others?
[02:40:45.998 --> 02:40:51.460]  I think I already talked to Richard in Texas.
[02:40:52.761 --> 02:40:53.801]  I don't know who I'm going to.
[02:40:53.821 --> 02:40:54.902]  We'll just go to the next caller.
[02:40:55.222 --> 02:40:56.402]  Whoever you are, you are.
[02:40:56.502 --> 02:40:57.263]  Caller, you're on the air.
[02:40:57.303 --> 02:40:57.763]  Who are you?
[02:40:59.464 --> 02:41:00.544]  Fred and Philly, you're on the air.
[02:41:00.604 --> 02:41:00.964]  Go ahead.
[02:41:00.984 --> 02:41:04.146]  Yeah, I'm not really disagreeing, but I do have some
[02:41:05.138 --> 02:41:10.081]  Uh, information about the shooter that contradicts the, uh, the person you mentioned earlier.
[02:41:10.101 --> 02:41:11.121]  Well, you're allowed to disagree.
[02:41:11.141 --> 02:41:12.242]  That's why I went to the head of the line.
[02:41:12.262 --> 02:41:12.702]  Go ahead.
[02:41:13.002 --> 02:41:17.765]  But I'm not, uh, I'm not, uh, you know, trying to, uh, undermine your show.
[02:41:18.685 --> 02:41:22.347]  Um, did you say the guy's name was Chow Hui Sung?
[02:41:23.088 --> 02:41:25.509]  Yeah, that's what's in, uh, all the newspapers.
[02:41:25.889 --> 02:41:26.310]  Okay.
[02:41:26.670 --> 02:41:32.633]  Uh, on MS, on MSNBC last night, late, uh, investigative reporter lady,
[02:41:33.471 --> 02:41:40.717]  Uh, said that law enforcement had given her reports to indicate that it was a Chinese national.
[02:41:40.737 --> 02:41:44.740]  2425, who got to San Francisco.
[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:46.081]  Yeah, that's the same thing.
[02:41:46.121 --> 02:41:52.046]  The guy that has the same name, uh, is on YouTube and he says he's Chinese.
[02:41:52.366 --> 02:41:53.447]  But it looks just like him.
[02:41:53.467 --> 02:41:54.087]  This is weird.
[02:41:54.107 --> 02:42:00.973]  This is weird, and also if you look at the language for a second, it is different.
[02:42:01.857 --> 02:42:05.178]  When you say Chow Wee Soong, that's definitely a Chinese name.
[02:42:05.578 --> 02:42:10.319]  The one that this morning on all the three networks, they said something completely different.
[02:42:10.359 --> 02:42:13.060]  They said Soong Hoi Cho.
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:14.720]  Now that's Korean.
[02:42:15.721 --> 02:42:18.621]  You can't really have both names.
[02:42:19.521 --> 02:42:20.442]  Let me dig it out here.
[02:42:23.643 --> 02:42:25.443]  And they spelled it different.
[02:42:26.821 --> 02:42:27.722]  I don't know what's going on.
[02:42:27.742 --> 02:42:29.042]  Look, you can't believe anything they're saying.
[02:42:29.062 --> 02:42:29.683]  That's my point.
[02:42:29.743 --> 02:42:32.844]  No, I do have something to say about this whole process.
[02:42:33.284 --> 02:42:38.207]  I think it's a counter-intelligence domination of the investigative process.
[02:42:38.267 --> 02:42:40.368]  That explains the clamp-down on facts.
[02:42:40.968 --> 02:42:46.271]  That explains the simultaneous release of information to the networks this morning.
[02:42:47.131 --> 02:42:54.175]  That explains no question and answer at the second press conference, and it explains
[02:42:57.009 --> 02:43:04.537]  Making things palatable, making all the facts about this person palatable to us.
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:15.729]  So I think you've got that counterintelligence domination of this process where they want to determine how it sounds
[02:43:16.986 --> 02:43:20.111]  In advance, and then they'll go forward and filter the facts.
[02:43:20.591 --> 02:43:21.152]  Sure, sure.
[02:43:21.192 --> 02:43:22.955]  No, I mean, the thing reeks to high heaven.
[02:43:23.015 --> 02:43:24.277]  It stinks of black op.
[02:43:24.637 --> 02:43:25.639]  I appreciate your call.
[02:43:25.659 --> 02:43:30.025]  It just totally reeks like nothing I've ever seen with a school shooting since Columbine.
[02:43:30.859 --> 02:43:31.980]  I said I was going to play these clips.
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:33.001]  I'm glad I remembered.
[02:43:33.021 --> 02:43:35.703]  Let's play the first one from ABC News with Bob Woodward.
[02:43:35.903 --> 02:43:39.286]  This is a week plus into New Orleans.
[02:43:39.626 --> 02:43:40.947]  They're in the high and dry areas.
[02:43:41.027 --> 02:43:42.708]  I mean in $10 million home areas.
[02:43:42.728 --> 02:43:44.029]  So imagine when it was in the poor areas.
[02:43:44.570 --> 02:43:46.892]  They were going into nice homes confiscating their guns.
[02:43:47.232 --> 02:43:49.734]  Traitorous troops are saying they don't like it, but they have to.
[02:43:50.174 --> 02:43:53.577]  Again, we can't bring you food and water, but in an emergency we've got to come take your guns.
[02:43:54.392 --> 02:43:57.814]  FBI leading the military and police in confiscating guns.
[02:43:58.115 --> 02:43:59.876]  Remember what it's all about.
[02:44:01.076 --> 02:44:02.037]  Remember the government.
[02:44:02.057 --> 02:44:05.679]  We ought to have an article about how the government does want to confiscate your guns.
[02:44:06.020 --> 02:44:07.080]  Gun confiscation is real.
[02:44:07.100 --> 02:44:09.402]  We need to rehash and re-release those articles.
[02:44:09.622 --> 02:44:10.783]  Listeners, you need to write articles.
[02:44:11.203 --> 02:44:18.568]  We need to promote PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, a clearinghouse of the truth about the Second Amendment, to get the materials, to counterattack the media,
[02:44:19.028 --> 02:44:21.709]  And then let's not... Second Amendment's been winning lately.
[02:44:21.729 --> 02:44:22.989]  We've been winning hearts and minds.
[02:44:23.369 --> 02:44:24.990]  We've been beating a lot of gun legislation.
[02:44:25.070 --> 02:44:27.110]  We need to not let them get the initiative on this.
[02:44:28.391 --> 02:44:30.071]  I'm dead serious, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:30.091 --> 02:44:31.652]  That's why I've been so mad I could barely do the show.
[02:44:32.812 --> 02:44:38.874]  Because it's just pure bull watching what they did and not defending those people and the students sitting there and just having it happen to them.
[02:44:39.734 --> 02:44:44.816]  I'm sorry they're dead, I'm sorry they're wounded, but my God, I commend the students who at least jumped out of the windows.
[02:44:46.423 --> 02:44:49.624]  You know, it's better to have a broken ankle than to have a bullet in your head, so good job.
[02:44:49.644 --> 02:44:52.385]  At least they took some initiative and didn't cower.
[02:44:52.765 --> 02:44:54.306]  At least they got out and jumped out of the window.
[02:44:55.666 --> 02:44:58.807]  But let's air the ABC one first.
[02:44:58.847 --> 02:44:59.227]  Here it is.
[02:44:59.988 --> 02:45:05.249]  That includes New Orleans, where today authorities stepped up their efforts to empty the city.
[02:45:05.790 --> 02:45:09.551]  Bob Woodruff is there again tonight with an extraordinary human drama unfolding.
[02:45:09.611 --> 02:45:09.811]  Bob?
[02:45:11.590 --> 02:45:13.412]  That's true, Elizabeth, and good evening from New Orleans.
[02:45:13.452 --> 02:45:23.460]  Here, the police and the National Guard find themselves in a very difficult position tonight to try to carry out an order to force people from the city without actually using force.
[02:45:28.124 --> 02:45:30.987]  Today in New Orleans, they got a lot tougher on the holdouts.
[02:45:33.168 --> 02:45:37.112]  Not only the flooded areas, but New Orleans' driest and wealthiest neighborhoods, too.
[02:45:40.836 --> 02:45:46.020]  The police and National Guard going street by street, house to house.
[02:45:46.620 --> 02:45:50.703]  We need to make sure, too, that whenever we knock on doors, people refuse to leave.
[02:45:50.743 --> 02:45:52.404]  We need to make a note, call again.
[02:45:53.645 --> 02:45:57.328]  They say there are no orders to use force, just strong persuasion.
[02:45:57.688 --> 02:46:03.873]  Sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn, and instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[02:46:04.984 --> 02:46:06.605]  You said guns will be taken?
[02:46:06.645 --> 02:46:07.865]  No one will be able to be armed.
[02:46:08.125 --> 02:46:09.126]  We will take all weapons.
[02:46:09.806 --> 02:46:14.788]  That happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed themselves to protect their mansions.
[02:46:16.689 --> 02:46:18.550]  Residents were handcuffed on the ground.
[02:46:19.010 --> 02:46:22.172]  In the end, police took their weapons but let them stay in their homes.
[02:46:22.672 --> 02:46:25.493]  They were a little bit threatened because our weapons were bigger than their weapons.
[02:46:27.234 --> 02:46:31.936]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[02:46:33.593 --> 02:46:35.754]  This guard unit searched, using it as a base camp.
[02:46:36.154 --> 02:46:39.735]  They had to leave a note because they could not get hold of the pastor to get permission.
[02:46:39.975 --> 02:46:41.155]  It is, it is surreal.
[02:46:41.895 --> 02:46:45.336]  Yeah, you just never, you never expect to do this in your own country.
[02:46:46.177 --> 02:46:50.618]  Chris Montgomery says he'd rather be in Iraq than patrolling American neighborhoods.
[02:46:50.938 --> 02:46:55.679]  Walking up and down these streets, you don't, you don't want to think about the stuff that you're gonna have to do.
[02:46:55.699 --> 02:46:58.340]  Somebody pops around the corner, and you shoot an American.
[02:47:00.228 --> 02:47:02.508]  Yeah, you shoot an American, you shoot an American.
[02:47:02.528 --> 02:47:03.409]  What would we like to do?
[02:47:03.509 --> 02:47:04.629]  Shoot an American.
[02:47:04.649 --> 02:47:07.049]  Oh, we're going to rule everyone, they say.
[02:47:07.069 --> 02:47:12.190]  They say no forces used, or slamming people down on the concrete in their homes and outside their homes.
[02:47:14.291 --> 02:47:16.671]  It was all lies, all twisting, all spin.
[02:47:17.671 --> 02:47:20.092]  They talk about shooting Americans, all the guns will be taken.
[02:47:20.112 --> 02:47:21.452]  They talk about, they go into open houses.
[02:47:21.472 --> 02:47:25.073]  No, they went into all the houses, and if you wouldn't leave, they would come and have the cops arrest you.
[02:47:26.087 --> 02:47:27.148]  Backed up by the military.
[02:47:27.688 --> 02:47:29.849]  Regular Army was there as well as National Guard.
[02:47:29.969 --> 02:47:30.990]  That was a big deception.
[02:47:32.691 --> 02:47:35.133]  FEMA held everybody back and wouldn't let aid come in.
[02:47:35.153 --> 02:47:39.535]  And this was a city-clearing, dry run for martial law.
[02:47:39.595 --> 02:47:40.096]  Huge test.
[02:47:40.296 --> 02:47:43.618]  Then FEMA claims they screw up, they get double funding, see?
[02:47:44.118 --> 02:47:46.199]  And then, oh, we screw up and they fire Brownie.
[02:47:48.038 --> 02:47:53.320]  Man, they know what they're doing, and now they're talking about it's all over the news, how they're going to turn the schools into big police states, the colleges.
[02:47:53.860 --> 02:48:05.603]  I told you they've already got the diagrams all drawn up, and it'll be Homeland Security-affiliated private companies, and Bush administration people that come in and cronyize it all, and big tuition increases.
[02:48:05.643 --> 02:48:10.725]  Your kids won't learn how to be engineers, or college professors, or scholars.
[02:48:10.745 --> 02:48:11.805]  They'll just learn how to be slaves.
[02:48:14.362 --> 02:48:16.004]  And so that's the bottom line on that.
[02:48:16.024 --> 02:48:17.005]  We have another clip.
[02:48:17.446 --> 02:48:20.029]  Start the one where they're grabbing the lady in her house.
[02:48:20.049 --> 02:48:21.070]  They ask her if she has any guns.
[02:48:21.090 --> 02:48:21.730]  She pulls it out.
[02:48:21.951 --> 02:48:23.693]  Then they tackle her and, oh lady, here it is.
[02:48:24.293 --> 02:48:27.136]  Ordered to remove people by force if necessary.
[02:48:27.316 --> 02:48:33.163]  KTVU's Ken Wayne rode along with a unit of the California Highway Patrol and witnessed some residents putting up a fight.
[02:48:33.183 --> 02:48:34.705]  He joins us now from New Orleans.
[02:48:34.805 --> 02:48:34.905]  Ken.
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:37.921]  Dennis, California... Stop right there.
[02:48:37.941 --> 02:48:38.901]  We're going to come back and play that.
[02:48:38.921 --> 02:48:39.642]  See the deception?
[02:48:40.102 --> 02:48:42.363]  Local news said they've been ordered to do it by force.
[02:48:42.723 --> 02:48:44.304]  The mayor and the police chief said it.
[02:48:44.584 --> 02:48:46.325]  But see, nationally, they don't want to scare people.
[02:48:46.365 --> 02:48:51.147]  So it's, oh, just if houses are open, we're not using force, ah, slam you down, take your guns.
[02:48:51.167 --> 02:48:52.128]  They never got their guns back.
[02:48:52.408 --> 02:48:54.989]  Some of these houses, you know, some of these rich guys have like a hundred guns.
[02:48:55.610 --> 02:48:57.511]  And the troops would just laugh.
[02:48:57.591 --> 02:48:58.791]  Oh my God, this is mine.
[02:48:58.831 --> 02:49:04.154]  The dirty cops would... I mean, you saw the cops looting Walmart for themselves, you know, Playstations.
[02:49:04.944 --> 02:49:06.606]  And telling cameramen to turn their cameras off.
[02:49:06.746 --> 02:49:08.488]  Big fat cops everywhere stealing.
[02:49:09.089 --> 02:49:10.270]  I mean, that's America, folks.
[02:49:10.290 --> 02:49:11.131]  You don't have a GED.
[02:49:11.331 --> 02:49:11.832]  You have nothing.
[02:49:11.852 --> 02:49:13.194]  You go be a big fat hog.
[02:49:13.214 --> 02:49:17.939]  And you get to go around and feed on everybody and boss people with degrees you've worked your butts off.
[02:49:18.380 --> 02:49:20.362]  That's what it's all about, being a big fat hog.
[02:49:22.284 --> 02:49:22.745]  Sick of it.
[02:49:24.547 --> 02:49:25.448]  Taking our guns.
[02:49:29.096 --> 02:49:29.897]  I'm in a bad mood.
[02:49:29.957 --> 02:49:30.658]  I'm gonna admit it.
[02:49:30.678 --> 02:49:32.040]  I'm just sick and tired of it.
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:33.282]  You're not our God.
[02:49:33.362 --> 02:49:34.283]  You're not our government.
[02:49:34.564 --> 02:49:35.585]  Good cops, we like you.
[02:49:35.625 --> 02:49:38.650]  But bad cops that follow these orders, you're traitorous trash.
[02:49:38.830 --> 02:49:39.931]  You're enemies of America.
[02:49:40.072 --> 02:49:40.773]  You're terrorists.
[02:49:41.053 --> 02:49:42.195]  You are the real terrorist.
[02:49:47.561 --> 02:49:50.744]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:49:51.085 --> 02:49:53.027]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:49:53.387 --> 02:50:01.015]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:50:01.713 --> 02:50:08.775]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:50:09.176 --> 02:50:20.599]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:50:20.899 --> 02:50:24.381]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:50:24.861 --> 02:50:26.801]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:50:27.122 --> 02:50:30.983]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:44.238 --> 02:50:49.322]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:50:49.382 --> 02:50:56.688]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:50:56.848 --> 02:51:07.137]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:51:07.677 --> 02:51:12.221]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:51:12.501 --> 02:51:17.484]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[02:51:17.704 --> 02:51:20.646]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:51:20.866 --> 02:51:30.691]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:51:44.358 --> 02:51:46.079]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:51:46.299 --> 02:51:50.002]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:51:50.322 --> 02:51:52.543]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[02:51:53.064 --> 02:51:59.268]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:51:59.408 --> 02:52:04.331]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[02:52:04.531 --> 02:52:13.477]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[02:52:44.617 --> 02:52:47.479]  Ordered to remove people by force if necessary.
[02:52:47.620 --> 02:52:53.484]  KTVU's Ken Wayne rode along with a unit of the California Highway Patrol and witnessed some residents putting up a fight.
[02:52:53.524 --> 02:52:55.026]  He joins us now from New Orleans.
[02:52:55.126 --> 02:52:55.286]  Ken.
[02:52:56.756 --> 02:53:02.178]  Dennis, the California Highway Patrol has about 100 officers here, including 20 of them from the Bay Area.
[02:53:02.578 --> 02:53:07.900]  And they were out on the streets of New Orleans today urging the few residents that remain to evacuate.
[02:53:08.221 --> 02:53:09.961]  But not everyone wanted to go.
[02:53:10.081 --> 02:53:12.822]  Officers found an elderly woman on Magazine Street.
[02:53:13.203 --> 02:53:16.344]  She had stayed behind with her two dogs and refused to come out.
[02:53:16.884 --> 02:53:21.666]  Officers finally got into the house and found the woman was armed with a handgun and a knife.
[02:53:22.479 --> 02:53:26.821]  You're going to have to shoot me because I'm not going to.
[02:53:26.841 --> 02:53:27.862]  I'm not going to do that.
[02:53:27.882 --> 02:53:29.643]  Well, I don't want you in here.
[02:53:29.663 --> 02:53:31.023]  Well, I'm not going to do that.
[02:53:31.164 --> 02:53:33.225]  I don't want you in here, period.
[02:53:33.425 --> 02:53:34.225]  We've got a gun.
[02:53:34.285 --> 02:53:35.346]  Relax, relax, relax.
[02:53:36.126 --> 02:53:38.247]  Relax now, relax now.
[02:53:38.367 --> 02:53:39.708]  You son of a...
[02:53:49.187 --> 02:53:49.927]  That's enough.
[02:53:50.328 --> 02:53:51.349]  It's their house, it's their home.
[02:53:51.709 --> 02:53:54.732]  They can't wait to attack you, they can't wait to take your guns.
[02:53:54.792 --> 02:53:58.395]  This is how they, the greedy scum of the earth, it's called tyranny.
[02:53:58.476 --> 02:54:03.240]  They come and they take the hard work and people's ideas, your families, your sons for war.
[02:54:03.681 --> 02:54:05.622]  This is slavery, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:05.943 --> 02:54:08.966]  I want to jam in some final calls from Todd, Harold, and Lucas.
[02:54:09.626 --> 02:54:10.888]  But I have a giant stack.
[02:54:10.948 --> 02:54:14.291]  Everybody's coming into the office saying all it is is total calls for gun control.
[02:54:14.832 --> 02:54:18.496]  FBI on CNN last night saying we need to start banning guns.
[02:54:18.536 --> 02:54:19.236]  Second Amendment.
[02:54:20.177 --> 02:54:20.438]  U.S.
[02:54:20.478 --> 02:54:23.180]  churches call for gun control following university shootings.
[02:54:23.561 --> 02:54:26.184]  Rampage prompts calls for tougher gun control.
[02:54:26.924 --> 02:54:27.204]  U.S.
[02:54:27.265 --> 02:54:28.105]  University shootings.
[02:54:28.145 --> 02:54:29.446]  Call for tighter gun control.
[02:54:29.786 --> 02:54:32.588]  Senator Grassley says shooting will lead to calls for more gun control.
[02:54:33.129 --> 02:54:35.591]  Gun control calls following university killings.
[02:54:36.651 --> 02:54:37.572]  Gun tragedy.
[02:54:37.672 --> 02:54:39.053]  Screams need for gun control.
[02:54:39.333 --> 02:54:41.495]  Gun control back on agenda in Australia.
[02:54:41.795 --> 02:54:43.036]  See, they've already banned most guns there.
[02:54:43.056 --> 02:54:43.796]  Now they want to ban them all.
[02:54:43.816 --> 02:54:45.358]  It's going to be used worldwide for gun control.
[02:54:45.758 --> 02:54:47.899]  Gun control is tough sell in Congress.
[02:54:48.220 --> 02:54:50.461]  Rampage likely to stir debate on gun control.
[02:54:50.521 --> 02:54:51.282]  Orlando Sentinel.
[02:54:52.582 --> 02:54:55.905]  Uh, and, uh, one good article, more guns, not fewer, would have saved lives.
[02:54:56.405 --> 02:54:57.626]  Thank God there's a few of those.
[02:54:57.646 --> 02:55:00.869]  Uh, and, uh, we're in deep trouble, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:02.170 --> 02:55:07.074]  Uh, Rosie O'Donnell now feels tougher gun control is impossible.
[02:55:07.114 --> 02:55:08.335]  She's starting to come around, folks.
[02:55:09.396 --> 02:55:10.497]  Uh, it just goes on and on.
[02:55:10.517 --> 02:55:12.018]  Yeah, we've deprogrammed her pretty good.
[02:55:13.817 --> 02:55:18.279]  Now listen, I'm telling you right now, ladies and gentlemen, you go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:18.299 --> 02:55:21.081]  We got the most hard-hitting articles from everybody up there.
[02:55:21.121 --> 02:55:23.882]  You get them, and you spam the net, and you get aggressive.
[02:55:24.182 --> 02:55:26.904]  And I've been hearing scumbag Fox News calling for gun control.
[02:55:26.944 --> 02:55:28.204]  You call those scumbags.
[02:55:28.544 --> 02:55:29.345]  You call CNN.
[02:55:29.385 --> 02:55:30.165]  You call them all.
[02:55:30.505 --> 02:55:31.106]  And you tell them.
[02:55:31.126 --> 02:55:32.967]  And you call your filthy police chiefs, too.
[02:55:33.187 --> 02:55:34.808]  You tell them you drug-dealing scum.
[02:55:34.828 --> 02:55:36.608]  Alright, they're not all drug-dealing scum.
[02:55:37.069 --> 02:55:38.910]  You tell them we don't want gun control.
[02:55:38.930 --> 02:55:39.570]  Do you understand?
[02:55:40.282 --> 02:55:40.982]  You back off.
[02:55:41.002 --> 02:55:41.502]  We've had enough.
[02:55:41.542 --> 02:55:42.402]  We're not your slaves.
[02:55:42.903 --> 02:55:43.843]  Todd in Washington.
[02:55:43.863 --> 02:55:44.463]  You're on the air.
[02:55:44.503 --> 02:55:44.963]  Go ahead.
[02:55:45.423 --> 02:55:45.663]  Yes.
[02:55:46.883 --> 02:55:54.325]  Alex, I don't know if you reported on this, but last month there was a shooting at the University of Washington in Seattle.
[02:55:54.705 --> 02:55:54.965]  Yes.
[02:55:56.065 --> 02:55:59.726]  They pinned the guy down and he shot himself, I believe, is the way it went.
[02:56:00.166 --> 02:56:07.047]  And I think it was that same day or the following day there was almost the same scenario at the University of Idaho.
[02:56:07.674 --> 02:56:08.674]  The people have been stopped.
[02:56:08.694 --> 02:56:09.414]  Oh, that's a good point.
[02:56:09.434 --> 02:56:12.995]  See, write an article up in an email with hyperlinks, send it to us with a headline.
[02:56:13.275 --> 02:56:13.856]  We'll post it.
[02:56:13.896 --> 02:56:14.996]  We can't cover every angle.
[02:56:15.016 --> 02:56:16.656]  It's very, exactly, very suspicious.
[02:56:17.396 --> 02:56:20.837]  A week later, there's a kid in Oregon who took a gun to high school.
[02:56:21.317 --> 02:56:29.959]  He was going to take his whole class out, but they managed to subdue him and get the gun away from him without anybody dying.
[02:56:30.079 --> 02:56:32.200]  But they had drills at this school so much,
[02:56:33.277 --> 02:56:35.298]  That they all did what they were told in this case.
[02:56:35.318 --> 02:56:35.918]  We're out of time.
[02:56:36.038 --> 02:56:36.458]  Ride it up.
[02:56:36.518 --> 02:56:37.279]  I remember all those.
[02:56:37.339 --> 02:56:37.819]  Send them to us.
[02:56:37.859 --> 02:56:38.639]  Help us, listeners.
[02:56:39.239 --> 02:56:39.860]  I can go to Harold.
[02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:40.460]  Sorry to Lucas.
[02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:41.300]  Harold in Arkansas.
[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:41.780]  Last caller.
[02:56:41.820 --> 02:56:42.160]  Go ahead.
[02:56:42.941 --> 02:56:43.041]  Oh.
[02:56:44.321 --> 02:56:44.962]  Uh, yeah.
[02:56:45.002 --> 02:56:45.482]  Hi, Alex.
[02:56:45.842 --> 02:56:46.042]  Hi.
[02:56:46.062 --> 02:56:46.762]  We're almost out of time.
[02:56:47.202 --> 02:56:48.703]  First time caller, guy.
[02:56:48.863 --> 02:56:54.445]  But, uh, I could, uh, I couldn't keep listening without having to give some opinion of my own.
[02:56:54.685 --> 02:56:55.105]  Go ahead.
[02:56:55.526 --> 02:56:59.347]  Well, when you got the wolves, uh, guarding the hen house, you're gonna lose a lot of chickens.
[02:57:01.228 --> 02:57:01.808]  They, uh,
[02:57:02.557 --> 02:57:07.361]  This race has been slated for total destruction.
[02:57:10.363 --> 02:57:20.592]  We will be a source of food and spoils for 21 nations.
[02:57:20.952 --> 02:57:22.373]  I tell you what, call in to Mark!
