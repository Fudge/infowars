[00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:06.470]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.210]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.891 --> 00:00:10.031]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.671 --> 00:00:11.491]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.232 --> 00:00:13.212]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:17.573]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.993 --> 00:00:22.075]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:34.879]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.680]  It is the 12th day of June 2007 and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.501]  The news I have is so important today
[00:01:00.956 --> 00:01:11.806]  Of such massive import, of such importance, that I am not even going to begin to cover the main news for 30 minutes.
[00:01:13.927 --> 00:01:17.871]  I know I put the call out for you to help spread the word about this broadcast.
[00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:26.939]  I know I asked you to tell your email list, your MySpace friends, your Yahoo groups, your co-workers inside your office about the show.
[00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:33.058]  I'm telling you right now, we need to cause a chain reaction today.
[00:01:33.998 --> 00:01:37.519]  In the next 30 minutes, I don't care if you're driving down the highway in a truck.
[00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.740]  I don't care if you are working in an office cubicle.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.120]  I don't care if you're at lunch and you are a school teacher.
[00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:50.761]  I don't care if you're a police officer.
[00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:54.522]  I want you to call everyone you know.
[00:01:56.636 --> 00:02:00.937]  In the next 30 minutes and tell them to tune in to what we're going to cover today.
[00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:12.241]  Now, if you can't do it in the next 30 minutes, you can simply tell your friends, your family, your neighbors, your email list, whatever, that it's in the middle of the first hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:14.181]  They can listen to it at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:21.664]  There is a free podcast there you can subscribe to that we serve out each day when the show ends to, I don't know, it's over 40,000 people.
[00:02:21.684 --> 00:02:21.984]  I know that.
[00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.120]  And we also restream the show 24 hours a day.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.001]  21 hours out of the day it is a retransmission.
[00:02:32.021 --> 00:02:36.802]  We're live 11 to 2 and it just consecutively streams at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:39.403 --> 00:02:40.904]  And it's available right now.
[00:02:42.084 --> 00:02:43.244]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:52.747]  I, even being submerged in this movement, even studying it constantly, literally living it, breathing it,
[00:02:53.593 --> 00:02:58.556]  Eating it, sleeping it, and yes, even crapping it.
[00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:02.978]  Look folks, I'm just going to get totally real today with you.
[00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:19.287]  I literally last night, it was like, this is happening to me every year or so I guess, got knocked off my horse like Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus and really saw it for what it was.
[00:03:21.337 --> 00:03:27.479]  Just everything coming together, and I already knew it intellectually, but it hit me in the pit of my stomach.
[00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:35.261]  And it hit me right in the frontal lobes of my brain, right in my cerebral cortex, and then it hit me right down in my brain stem, right down in my animal center.
[00:03:37.101 --> 00:03:44.263]  Just how real this is, and that the people running things are just as evil as we've always said they are, and more.
[00:03:44.403 --> 00:03:46.124]  It is unfathomable.
[00:03:47.104 --> 00:03:48.104]  It is unspeakable.
[00:03:48.244 --> 00:03:49.785]  Frankly, people who aren't wicked
[00:03:51.596 --> 00:03:57.739]  Those of us that aren't given over to evil wantonly, we're all evil, by the way, but many of us try not to be.
[00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:20.949]  Those of us that are not wantonly wicked and dark cannot even begin to grasp the edges of what we're facing, but we can see the piles of dead bodies from Communist China, Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, Stasi Germany, and I'm telling you, we're in for the fight of our lives, and they're going to do it all.
[00:04:21.917 --> 00:04:24.279]  You better be absolutely assured of that.
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:36.388]  And for everybody in government, everybody who thinks this is going to be a cakewalk, and all of you out there that think this is going to be a piece of cake, I want the servants of this to know it's going to be a rougher ride for you than most of us.
[00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:42.093]  You've signed on to something, and I want you to know what you've signed on to.
[00:04:42.113 --> 00:04:50.019]  So I'm going to attempt, in 25 minutes from now, like I've never done before,
[00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:53.090]  to really lay out what we're facing.
[00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.051]  Call everybody you know, tell them to tune in right now.
[00:04:57.071 --> 00:05:10.097]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.457 --> 00:05:18.060]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.795 --> 00:05:25.859]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:37.667]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.987 --> 00:05:41.489]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:43.890]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.053]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.503 --> 00:06:06.726]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:14.971]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:06:15.211 --> 00:06:22.275]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:06:22.455 --> 00:06:23.736]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:29.701]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:34.985]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:06:35.105 --> 00:06:43.993]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:06:44.253 --> 00:06:47.535]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:06:49.637 --> 00:06:49.978]  We're good.
[00:07:01.295 --> 00:07:05.558]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:10.642]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:10.902 --> 00:07:12.243]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:12.424 --> 00:07:15.806]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[00:07:16.026 --> 00:07:21.210]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[00:07:27.535 --> 00:07:29.956]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[00:07:30.056 --> 00:07:32.377]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.

[00:07:36.198 --> 00:07:37.139]  No animal testing.
[00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:38.719]  I use them and love them.
[00:07:38.739 --> 00:07:40.340]  Knowing they're all naturally safe.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.741]  And I say big time.
[00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:43.261]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:43.501]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[00:08:01.307 --> 00:08:06.348]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.708 --> 00:08:09.049]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:14.810]  Dildo diligent.
[00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.691]  Almost perpetual continual study.
[00:08:19.891 --> 00:08:22.732]  More pieces fell together in my investigation.
[00:08:23.622 --> 00:08:25.883]  Of the New World Order last night.
[00:08:30.065 --> 00:08:41.569]  And I already consciously knew everything that came together for me, but literally, literally, I wouldn't even call it being freaked out or nauseated like I've been in the past.
[00:08:43.542 --> 00:08:47.844]  It was more just a realization to a higher level.
[00:08:47.965 --> 00:08:53.488]  I wouldn't call it total realization of the New World Order, because no one can grasp that but God.
[00:08:54.248 --> 00:08:58.130]  Not even Beelzebub can grasp the entire handiwork that we're witnessing here.
[00:09:00.892 --> 00:09:08.676]  I mean, in the past, when I've been reading the Chicago Tribune, where they openly announce that the Halliburton and Nine Corps alone
[00:09:09.568 --> 00:09:18.971]  Run giant child kidnapping rings with over a million two children total out of Eastern Europe, Central Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia.
[00:09:19.551 --> 00:09:24.652]  That they're shipped to slave camps, slave factories, and to sex slave camps, to slave brothels.
[00:09:26.593 --> 00:09:33.755]  And then when I read in the Chicago Tribune, there have been a lot of national articles now about it, a handful, but still that's quite a bit for something like this.
[00:09:33.775 --> 00:09:38.076]  I don't know, 10, 15 or so over the years here in the U.S.
[00:09:38.923 --> 00:09:52.968]  That they have lobbyists, full-time lobbyists on Capitol Hill, lobbying members of Congress so that the Defense Department won't enforce laws, where this is mainly going on a military basis.
[00:09:53.008 --> 00:09:56.149]  They mainly have the holding centers, the slave holding centers.
[00:09:56.789 --> 00:10:02.751]  I mean, literally, we're talking hostile movies like that, but this is for real, where they distribute them out.
[00:10:03.892 --> 00:10:05.132]  I mean, this is real, folks.
[00:10:05.753 --> 00:10:06.153]  You understand?
[00:10:06.193 --> 00:10:06.933]  That stuff's real.
[00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:14.603]  But only a small percentage are actually sent to facilities where people pay high dollar to rip them to shreds and blow their heads off and do other things.
[00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:17.285]  But that, nonetheless, does go on.
[00:10:18.106 --> 00:10:19.747]  And you want sources on that?
[00:10:19.767 --> 00:10:26.892]  I mean, I remember when, what was it, five years ago, four and a half years ago, national Italian TV producers gave the go-ahead.
[00:10:26.932 --> 00:10:29.654]  The head of the network gave the go-ahead to show
[00:10:31.278 --> 00:10:38.043]  A report, and they didn't show the killing, they just showed the video of Russian toddlers before they were raped and had their heads blown off.
[00:10:39.644 --> 00:10:52.693]  And of course, in the report they reported about how this stuff was shipped to Hollywood to a well-known film producer who was distributing it and said for $20,000 per dub of that particular tape.
[00:10:53.213 --> 00:10:54.674]  That means there's a big market for this.
[00:10:54.694 --> 00:10:59.558]  Of course, the police here in this country don't bust the people blowing toddlers' heads off.
[00:11:00.507 --> 00:11:09.792]  No, they, uh, they'll go grab somebody's computer and, you know, claim something-something and then grandstand about how good they are.
[00:11:11.113 --> 00:11:13.054]  And by the way, cops, don't roll your eyes.
[00:11:13.134 --> 00:11:14.215]  Go do a Google search.
[00:11:14.495 --> 00:11:15.856]  Go do a LexisNexis search.
[00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:16.756]  You're investigators.
[00:11:17.096 --> 00:11:19.038]  Go pull up National Italian News.
[00:11:20.498 --> 00:11:23.180]  It said this particular Russian ring had grabbed thousands.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:28.543]  This was just one report about little, was it two and a three-year-old getting their heads blown off.
[00:11:32.386 --> 00:11:33.847]  This is America, okay?
[00:11:35.068 --> 00:11:37.029]  And, uh, I just want you to know that.
[00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:47.596]  I want you, as you sit there smugly and make your excuses for the power structure you work for, I want you to consciously realize what you're part of.
[00:11:51.041 --> 00:11:57.044]  But, you know, I like to rationalize the tyranny I see and think, well, it's not as bad as I think it is.
[00:11:57.124 --> 00:11:59.486]  It's not as bad as my analysis is.
[00:11:59.546 --> 00:12:06.550]  It's kind of like the analogy of the old-fashioned computer and the card pops out with a number on it and I go, no, no, that can't be right.
[00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:08.351]  That's got to be a mistake.
[00:12:09.531 --> 00:12:15.655]  That's why I don't get too mad at people I see on message boards and emails I get and going, oh, Alex, you're exaggerating.
[00:12:15.695 --> 00:12:16.935]  It's not as bad as you say.
[00:12:16.955 --> 00:12:18.736]  I kind of like those emails.
[00:12:18.796 --> 00:12:19.857]  I go, yeah, maybe
[00:12:20.578 --> 00:12:21.478]  Maybe they're right.
[00:12:22.739 --> 00:12:24.140]  Literally, I lay in bed at night.
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:25.640]  I can be exhausted.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:34.204]  It can be 2 a.m., 3 a.m., and I still sit there, you know, in the dead of night, in the quiet of the night, and it's not even fear, it's a sadness.
[00:12:34.324 --> 00:12:46.629]  I just think, well, maybe it's not as bad, and I go, but wait, that's confirmed, and that's confirmed, and this is confirmed, and all these thousands of things are confirmed, and I think, oh my God, it's true.
[00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:50.897]  It's as bad as I think it is, and I frankly know much worse.
[00:12:52.357 --> 00:12:54.858]  And then yesterday, it was a whole host of stories.
[00:12:54.938 --> 00:12:58.400]  Last night, from about 9 p.m.
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.221]  until about 1 in the morning, I was kind of an early evening.
[00:13:01.641 --> 00:13:07.584]  I was doing study on the new film, but I just kept coming across the news of the day.
[00:13:07.624 --> 00:13:09.445]  I mean, this wasn't the news of the week.
[00:13:09.745 --> 00:13:11.146]  This was the news of the day.
[00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:13.046]  And everywhere I looked, it was there.
[00:13:13.087 --> 00:13:16.288]  And I was thinking, my God, this is just off the chart.
[00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:23.071]  And I'm going to tell you the information, the analysis we've got, that literally brought me to my knees last night.
[00:13:29.033 --> 00:13:38.796]  Asking God what I should do, asking God what I... and the answer is stand and fight until the end, faithfully, and just do the right thing and God will do the rest.
[00:13:38.856 --> 00:13:40.316]  And I know many of you don't believe in God.
[00:13:40.356 --> 00:13:41.897]  Well, you sure better believe in the devil.
[00:13:42.463 --> 00:13:52.833]  Let's say there is no entity in this dark, cold universe that this little, warm, watery jewel rests in, in the vacuum of space.
[00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:56.476]  Let's just say there is no God.
[00:13:56.556 --> 00:13:57.857]  My God, there's a devil.
[00:13:59.919 --> 00:14:03.963]  I mean, and if it isn't an entity, it's us.
[00:14:05.104 --> 00:14:06.125]  It's our own people.
[00:14:06.225 --> 00:14:08.167]  My God, the things that go on.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:16.585]  And they coldly say to us, well, it's just all, we're animals and we might as well just think of ourselves and only care about ourselves and feed on the weak.
[00:14:16.625 --> 00:14:18.786]  And they call it some attribute, some strength.
[00:14:18.806 --> 00:14:20.607]  They actually believe it's a virtue.
[00:14:22.568 --> 00:14:31.273]  But they kind of enshrined an apocalypse now where he talks about the power, the beauty, the strength of hacking children's arms off.
[00:14:31.673 --> 00:14:32.874]  I don't think that's strength.
[00:14:33.454 --> 00:14:36.296]  And I've made the analogy, the parable, the example of
[00:14:37.216 --> 00:15:03.603]  If cancer had an intellect, if it had an intelligence, if it had a consciousness, bone cancer spreading through your organs and your brain and your skin, as you literally melt there in a bed, your very, all your life's memories, everything you've done, the love you've had, the pain you've had, the experiences melting away, burning away, that's real.
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.784]  And cancer, if it had an intelligence, would think, I am the elite!
[00:15:09.664 --> 00:15:10.625]  I am strong!
[00:15:10.945 --> 00:15:11.866]  I am taking over!
[00:15:12.246 --> 00:15:13.207]  I do what I want!
[00:15:13.327 --> 00:15:15.349]  I cram food in my face!
[00:15:15.449 --> 00:15:17.070]  I cram sex in my face!
[00:15:17.191 --> 00:15:19.252]  I cram power in my face!
[00:15:22.995 --> 00:15:24.797]  And it thinks that it is the elite!
[00:15:27.299 --> 00:15:28.920]  It says, I am the elite!
[00:15:29.441 --> 00:15:30.301]  I am the power!
[00:15:32.183 --> 00:15:33.384]  And I'm sorry you're not!
[00:15:34.085 --> 00:15:42.509]  You are aberrant, malfunctioning, and just everything in me says, resist you, deal with you, hunt you down, bring you to justice.
[00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:54.095]  And I try to ascribe humanity to the FBI, to the police, to the military, but everything I see them do tells me that there is a great spirit of wickedness upon us, and it is growing.
[00:15:55.470 --> 00:16:03.936]  And I want those who are very low-level in all this system, and who aren't conscious, but just who are attracted by that dark light.
[00:16:05.977 --> 00:16:08.018]  It is a darkness that puts off an aura.
[00:16:08.318 --> 00:16:13.562]  It has a pull to it, like a stench of rotten meat that attracts flies.
[00:16:14.022 --> 00:16:15.843]  And you don't know why you're attracted to it.
[00:16:15.903 --> 00:16:17.724]  You don't know why you're drawn towards it.
[00:16:18.085 --> 00:16:19.245]  You don't know why.
[00:16:19.265 --> 00:16:20.806]  I'll tell you why.
[00:16:20.826 --> 00:16:24.689]  It's because deep down you're afraid of it, and you think that if you embrace it,
[00:16:25.948 --> 00:16:30.894]  And then if you set up little rituals in your life around it, that somehow that's going to give you power over it.
[00:16:30.914 --> 00:16:36.140]  And I assure you, embracing this cancer will not protect you.
[00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:43.048]  The energy you feel emanating from it is the energy of destructive power and death.
[00:16:47.808 --> 00:17:07.238]  And because you're so empty and given so over to the flesh that your feelers have been burnt off, your probes have been burnt off, your antennas have been burnt off, your palate, your taste buds have been seared, your heart has been hardened, that it's the last thing that gives you any excitement.
[00:17:07.868 --> 00:17:15.916]  And when you merge with that, it is the ultimate sin, and you have wantonly decided to join the dark side.
[00:17:16.116 --> 00:17:20.060]  You have given up any shreds of humanity you've got left.
[00:17:20.321 --> 00:17:25.426]  And my God, it tears my guts out to see you join the New World Order.
[00:17:32.529 --> 00:17:37.752]  That's why the Globalists laugh and giggle and elbow each other and give each other awards and ritualize.
[00:17:37.772 --> 00:17:38.933]  We're going to go to Matt Kazee's.
[00:17:38.993 --> 00:17:40.514]  It was inside the Brown property.
[00:17:40.554 --> 00:17:42.555]  Huge developments there in a moment.
[00:17:49.499 --> 00:17:57.584]  But I just want you to know from the bottom of my heart that I don't want you to be destroyed.
[00:17:59.688 --> 00:18:06.534]  My pleasure in my whole life has always been seeing other people have a good time, other people have good lives, other people doing well.
[00:18:07.575 --> 00:18:19.465]  And I've never understood the attitude that frankly the majority of people have, and it's the beginning of evil, to think that for you to get ahead somebody else has got to fail.
[00:18:21.387 --> 00:18:25.010]  Or to revel in watching people fall.
[00:18:27.361 --> 00:18:30.770]  Whether they be some Hollywood person or even some politician.
[00:18:34.941 --> 00:18:35.984]  Because it is that
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.060]  It is that enjoyment.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:19:01.205]  I mean, that's why the Romans, they wrote books about it, the Roman elite, that they had the gladiatorial events to show the public spectacle of citizens and the public and people being torn limb from limb to habitualize it so the general public would feel like they were part of the oppressive apparatchik of the state so they would bond with it and accept it and have their delicate nature burned away.
[00:19:03.548 --> 00:19:09.031]  By the way, they sell it to you that Jack Bauer is manly because he tortures children to get answers.
[00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:11.732]  But really, they're just searing your conscience.
[00:19:12.073 --> 00:19:13.233]  They're blackening your heart.
[00:19:13.573 --> 00:19:30.102]  And they teach men that having the sickness of death on their bodies, trying to be aggressive and to be a death stalker, or at least to try to fit that mold, at least in semblance, which is the beginning of truly being evil,
[00:19:31.405 --> 00:19:34.807]  That which you idolize and model, if you truly seek it, you can become.
[00:19:36.368 --> 00:19:41.332]  And I just want men to know who have sought power, that when you stop seeking power, you will gain it.
[00:19:43.593 --> 00:19:53.500]  And when you stop trying to be powerful and wicked, you will truly find the real strength that flows like living waters out of the soul of God.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:59.384]  When we get back, we'll talk to Matt Kazee, and I'll break down news so shocking,
[00:20:00.387 --> 00:20:01.447]  It's blown me away.
[00:20:02.047 --> 00:20:04.928]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:20:05.268 --> 00:20:08.149]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:20:08.369 --> 00:20:14.570]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:22.252]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.

[00:21:02.379 --> 00:21:06.463]  Hi, this is Tom Andrew with Midas Resources, your source for gold and silver.
[00:21:07.084 --> 00:21:11.949]  Friday, June 1st, gold closed up $10 per ounce and silver closed up 32 cents per ounce.
[00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:16.294]  Significant daily gains in precious metals are not uncommon during volatile times.
[00:21:16.946 --> 00:21:19.067]  Don't get caught on the wrong side of this market.

[00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:36.913]  Precious Metals has always preserved purchasing power during times of confiscatory taxation and rampant inflation.
[00:21:37.513 --> 00:21:44.075]  Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan predicts a recession of alarming magnitude due to increasing budget and trade deficits.
[00:21:44.719 --> 00:21:49.766]  Listen folks, the current economic system is like a game of financial musical chairs.
[00:21:49.786 --> 00:21:49.966]  1-800-606-1294.
[00:21:50.086 --> 00:21:55.893]  Don't get caught standing without precious metals when the music stops.

[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.601]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:14.165]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.605 --> 00:22:21.808]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:22.521 --> 00:22:28.026]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:01.764 --> 00:23:03.505]  Government is best which governs least.
[00:23:03.645 --> 00:23:04.966]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:23:05.126 --> 00:23:07.947]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:23:08.307 --> 00:23:11.068]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:23:11.609 --> 00:23:18.332]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:24:09.984 --> 00:24:18.906]  Paul, everybody you know, coming up in the next segment, I'm going to lay out some news so incredible, it'll blow your mind.
[00:24:39.131 --> 00:24:41.233]  I've got to put it all together simply and succinctly.
[00:24:41.253 --> 00:24:44.336]  It's so important that people hear this, that they know about this.
[00:24:44.857 --> 00:24:53.144]  Matt Kazee was there for a couple days at the Brown property in New Hampshire.
[00:24:54.486 --> 00:24:58.149]  They have cut the phone and the power off and the internet off last night.
[00:24:58.249 --> 00:24:59.170]  They did call.
[00:25:00.071 --> 00:25:02.033]  We're putting this all in an article Steve Watson's doing.
[00:25:03.012 --> 00:25:08.081]  They did call the internet company and they said, yes, the authorities, the officials, the gods, not the servants.
[00:25:08.581 --> 00:25:09.443]  So everything's changed.
[00:25:09.844 --> 00:25:10.945]  Have cut your internet.
[00:25:12.448 --> 00:25:16.314]  And now it's out in the news today that there are armed men again in the woods.
[00:25:18.046 --> 00:25:23.788]  There's some other, Matt learned some other things from some local people, but I don't know how much we can say.
[00:25:23.848 --> 00:25:25.489]  We've got some pretty big breaking news here.
[00:25:25.989 --> 00:25:37.753]  Of course, yesterday, Mr. Brown was on and told you that this fellow posing as a quote, hillbilly came in, as we're talking about white supremacy, so they could later, you know, demonize the Browns if they agreed with it, which of course they didn't.
[00:25:38.653 --> 00:25:40.514]  They just demonize them before they go after them.
[00:25:41.894 --> 00:25:44.575]  And just to finish up,
[00:25:46.025 --> 00:25:52.468]  He then went and called them on the phone minutes before they cut the power off and just said, you guys are all wimps.
[00:25:52.688 --> 00:25:54.168]  He basically admitted he was a fad.
[00:25:55.609 --> 00:25:57.390]  But Matt Kazee, thanks for joining us.
[00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:59.450]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:02.492]  I mean, you can't tell us the new development you were told.
[00:26:02.532 --> 00:26:03.492]  That's pretty big news.
[00:26:03.672 --> 00:26:07.434]  I mean, frankly, I think people need to know that even if they are going to be going there.
[00:26:08.689 --> 00:26:16.896]  Well, I would, but I was asked by the family not to say anything until at least until tonight or tomorrow until we see what's going on.
[00:26:17.276 --> 00:26:19.758]  We have lost complete contact with the Browns.
[00:26:20.359 --> 00:26:26.384]  Anybody who is in the area who has a little courage, that's all you need is just a little because once you start, you'll be fine.
[00:26:27.154 --> 00:26:30.456]  Uh, anybody who is in the area needs to get up there as quick as possible.
[00:26:30.716 --> 00:26:32.437]  You need to call the local sheriff's office.
[00:26:32.717 --> 00:26:35.999]  You need to call the paper, I think it's the Union Star, maybe.
[00:26:36.039 --> 00:26:36.379]  I'm not sure.
[00:26:36.399 --> 00:26:37.379]  It's the Union something.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.500]  Union Ledger.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.501]  That's it.
[00:26:40.081 --> 00:26:41.702]  You need to call them and get them up there.
[00:26:41.722 --> 00:26:42.622]  They were there yesterday.
[00:26:42.662 --> 00:26:43.503]  They came in the house.
[00:26:44.543 --> 00:26:45.644]  Well, here's the problem.
[00:26:46.326 --> 00:26:47.706]  They are in the woods again.
[00:26:47.746 --> 00:26:50.847]  They have cut the power and the phones and the internet off.
[00:26:51.227 --> 00:26:52.468]  And then they just keep denying.
[00:26:52.628 --> 00:26:53.428]  Nothing's going on.
[00:26:53.488 --> 00:26:54.208]  Nothing's happening.
[00:26:54.708 --> 00:26:58.229]  And again, it's all part of just the government does nothing but lie now.
[00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:01.430]  Well, that's the absolute truth.
[00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.851]  I mean, that's all they can do because they can't say the truth because the truth is winning.
[00:27:05.291 --> 00:27:07.692]  And their whole empire is built on lies.
[00:27:09.212 --> 00:27:10.352]  I was there for two days.
[00:27:10.832 --> 00:27:12.633]  This is the sweetest family I've ever met.
[00:27:13.332 --> 00:27:18.717]  Ed and Elaine Brown are completely gracious, completely kind, and completely righteous.
[00:27:20.198 --> 00:27:22.620]  They're going to try and demonize them, but they're not going to be able to.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.802]  And, you know, Ed's a smart man.
[00:27:24.862 --> 00:27:28.024]  He saw that fed coming a mile away and realized what was going on.
[00:27:30.606 --> 00:27:31.367]  Absolutely.
[00:27:31.787 --> 00:27:33.429]  Now, we've got press reports here.
[00:27:33.469 --> 00:27:40.815]  They're up on PrisonPlanet.com, but there are reports now, before we totally lost contact with the Browns, of people walking around in the woods.
[00:27:40.955 --> 00:27:41.956]  The reporters, of course,
[00:27:43.188 --> 00:27:57.333]  We're reporting that they heard people in the woods walking around and talking and imagine just being stopped for quote not paying your income tax even if you believe all of this you believe you need to pay to the private federal reserve.
[00:27:58.114 --> 00:28:07.657]  The point here is is that this literally the illegal aliens are being given five-year tax amnesty and an amnesty for felonies and aggravated felonies that's in the bill.
[00:28:07.717 --> 00:28:11.819]  Bush is on the hill right now at the hill lobbying for all this
[00:28:12.645 --> 00:28:14.807]  Remember last week they said it was dead, gone forever?
[00:28:15.047 --> 00:28:16.869]  They do that to make everybody stand down, folks.
[00:28:17.289 --> 00:28:19.651]  Just like they're doing here with the Browns, all military tactics.
[00:28:21.072 --> 00:28:22.333]  Where do you see this going, Matt?
[00:28:22.353 --> 00:28:28.799]  You told me last night, I was on the phone with you as you drove off the property in case they arrested you, which they didn't.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:34.804]  I guess it was about 10 o'clock, 10.30 last night, Central, 11.30 your time, Eastern.
[00:28:34.824 --> 00:28:36.666]  I mean, where is all this going?
[00:28:37.432 --> 00:28:38.753]  Well, they're definitely in the woods.
[00:28:38.993 --> 00:28:40.573]  I was there when the reporters came in.
[00:28:40.593 --> 00:28:43.655]  That was the union ledger who came in and said that they heard people in the woods.
[00:28:44.495 --> 00:28:46.896]  I went out with somebody from in the house.
[00:28:47.396 --> 00:28:48.516]  We went driving.
[00:28:48.577 --> 00:28:50.957]  I videotaped this as we drove around looking for them.
[00:28:50.977 --> 00:28:53.358]  Now, these people are in gurney suits.
[00:28:53.659 --> 00:28:57.360]  And the way the terrain is out there, it would be hard to spot anybody.
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.501]  So we drove to the closest neighbor and they're all gone.
[00:29:01.102 --> 00:29:04.643]  Either they're telling the neighbors to leave or the neighbors are gone.
[00:29:04.683 --> 00:29:06.484]  They may have garrisoned the neighbor's house.
[00:29:06.524 --> 00:29:07.044]  We don't know.
[00:29:07.754 --> 00:29:12.159]  Um, there is one close neighbor who's got a trail that leads right up to the Browns' house.
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:17.906]  That's where they saw the sniper, uh, who was, I mean, a hundred yards away from their home.
[00:29:20.164 --> 00:29:21.665]  It's heating up big time.
[00:29:22.525 --> 00:29:25.347]  Somebody needs to get up there right now and see if they can establish contact.
[00:29:25.567 --> 00:29:29.748]  My only hope is that they're jamming the cell phones, because they can jam the cell phones that will.
[00:29:30.249 --> 00:29:34.271]  Yesterday, you know, the Fed had called right after they got off the phone.
[00:29:34.291 --> 00:29:35.251]  They shut off everything.
[00:29:35.291 --> 00:29:37.472]  They jammed all the cell phones, including mine.
[00:29:37.752 --> 00:29:38.733]  Couldn't do anything.
[00:29:38.753 --> 00:29:45.816]  Then right before your show starts, Alex, they knew that radio interviews were coming up, so they allowed the Browns to do multiple radio interviews.
[00:29:45.836 --> 00:29:46.056]  Stay there.
[00:29:46.076 --> 00:29:48.537]  Let's do a minute or two on the other side, then I'll get into the big news.
[00:29:51.872 --> 00:29:52.772]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.273 --> 00:29:54.893]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.773 --> 00:29:58.535]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.056 --> 00:30:04.557]  Do you know that you can go solar for under 1200 bucks now?
[00:30:05.077 --> 00:30:06.197]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[00:30:06.397 --> 00:30:10.519]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:30:11.152 --> 00:30:16.035]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[00:30:16.536 --> 00:30:22.960]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more!
[00:30:23.721 --> 00:30:26.422]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[00:30:26.582 --> 00:30:36.547]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[00:30:36.807 --> 00:30:40.509]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[00:30:40.569 --> 00:30:47.072]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[00:30:47.252 --> 00:30:48.293]  Are you ready to go solar?
[00:30:48.493 --> 00:30:49.433]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.

[00:31:00.818 --> 00:31:05.759]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[00:31:06.079 --> 00:31:07.960]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.201]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:31:11.381 --> 00:31:14.522]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:31:14.822 --> 00:31:16.663]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[00:31:16.943 --> 00:31:20.644]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:31:20.924 --> 00:31:23.585]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[00:31:24.205 --> 00:31:28.507]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:31:28.707 --> 00:31:32.948]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:31:33.388 --> 00:31:37.731]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.

[00:32:00.834 --> 00:32:03.556]  Are you lacking energy on a daily basis?

[00:33:23.966 --> 00:33:24.606]  Welcome back.
[00:33:26.007 --> 00:33:31.630]  We've got Randy Weaver from the Rivier Ridge siege.
[00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:34.632]  He lost his wife and some of his family.
[00:33:35.692 --> 00:33:38.974]  He'll be joining us coming up in the third hour.
[00:33:41.936 --> 00:33:49.260]  Finishing up with Matt Kaziz, who was reporting for us as an independent journalist up there at the Brown property.
[00:33:49.975 --> 00:33:53.476]  They have shut off everything and there are people in the woods.
[00:33:54.216 --> 00:33:58.857]  And meanwhile they're telling you there's no stalking, no assault, nothing planned.
[00:33:59.278 --> 00:34:00.158]  The government loves you.
[00:34:00.238 --> 00:34:01.378]  It's totally legitimate.
[00:34:01.778 --> 00:34:05.659]  Just hand over your firearms and the men in black uniforms will take good care of you and your family.
[00:34:06.199 --> 00:34:09.300]  They have really good prizes for everyone just waiting for you.
[00:34:10.361 --> 00:34:11.481]  Matt, finish up what you were saying.
[00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:17.994]  I was saying that I'm hoping that they just jammed the cell phones because they can jam the cell phones at will.
[00:34:18.615 --> 00:34:19.816]  They did jam our cell phones.
[00:34:19.996 --> 00:34:31.025]  I personally believe the Feds allowed Ed and Elaine Brown to do radio interviews because as soon as it was time to do the scheduled interviews, everything or the cell phones started working again.
[00:34:32.086 --> 00:34:34.207]  Well, that's because they want to hear what they have to say.
[00:34:34.368 --> 00:34:35.288]  Exactly.
[00:34:35.528 --> 00:34:36.009]  Exactly.
[00:34:36.502 --> 00:34:42.044]  So I'm hoping that they've just cut off all communications, that they had just activated the track phone last night.
[00:34:42.144 --> 00:34:43.565]  I've been trying to call and call.
[00:34:43.585 --> 00:34:45.366]  Have you tried the phone since the show started?
[00:34:46.306 --> 00:34:46.866]  I've tried.
[00:34:47.407 --> 00:34:48.107]  Nobody's answering.
[00:34:48.907 --> 00:34:49.747]  I've left messages.
[00:34:49.788 --> 00:34:50.608]  Nobody's calling back.
[00:34:51.548 --> 00:34:58.111]  Now, the landline's still dead, but there's a cell phone inside and it's not working.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:07.046]  They have got, yeah, they've got a few cell phones, a few track phones, I believe that they haven't activated, but if they don't have one working, they can't even activate it.
[00:35:08.587 --> 00:35:11.369]  And the problem is, as soon as they activate something, they start jamming it.
[00:35:12.309 --> 00:35:12.870]  Absolutely.
[00:35:16.112 --> 00:35:23.637]  We've got their supposed current track phone number they're using, and they're not answering, so it sounds like it's just being jammed.
[00:35:24.804 --> 00:35:25.384]  I hope so.
[00:35:25.424 --> 00:35:26.184]  I hope that's it.
[00:35:26.264 --> 00:35:33.146]  But all I'm saying is I got a message last time I talked to them was last night about 2.30 a.m.
[00:35:33.186 --> 00:35:34.086]  maybe, maybe 3.
[00:35:34.746 --> 00:35:37.227]  And they had gotten some information from locals.
[00:35:37.647 --> 00:35:42.748]  I do not want to say what it is right now, but they may be going in very soon.
[00:35:42.768 --> 00:35:45.348]  I hope they didn't go in last night.
[00:35:45.368 --> 00:35:52.650]  My gut is telling me that they didn't, that they're still using their feelers, and that they... Oh God, I hate to say this, but they might go in tonight.
[00:35:54.708 --> 00:36:02.394]  Well, they'll certainly keep doing this until we all get worn out talking about it, and then a month from now, nobody's talking about it and sick of hearing about it, they'll do it.
[00:36:02.974 --> 00:36:03.754]  Well, guess what, Alex?
[00:36:03.774 --> 00:36:06.797]  Stay underestimated, because we're not going to get tired from this.
[00:36:07.537 --> 00:36:09.458]  Nobody's going to quit talking about this.
[00:36:09.478 --> 00:36:10.539]  This isn't going to go away.
[00:36:10.559 --> 00:36:13.021]  This is going to blow up in their face one way or the other.
[00:36:14.522 --> 00:36:15.563]  I agree with you, my friend.
[00:36:15.623 --> 00:36:16.764]  God bless you, Matt Kazee.
[00:36:16.844 --> 00:36:19.546]  We appreciate your courage going in there to cover what's happening.
[00:36:20.186 --> 00:36:20.526]  You bet.
[00:36:20.566 --> 00:36:21.387]  Thank you so much.
[00:36:23.078 --> 00:36:25.539]  Okay, I thank everyone for tuning in.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.562]  This is very, very important, the information that I'm about to cover.
[00:36:32.203 --> 00:36:38.686]  And I'm going to do this as succinctly and calmly as I possibly can.
[00:36:41.547 --> 00:36:43.768]  The government is completely illegitimate.
[00:36:43.868 --> 00:36:45.249]  It is completely lawless.
[00:36:45.889 --> 00:36:48.491]  It does whatever it wants, whenever it wants.
[00:36:48.571 --> 00:36:49.271]  Case in point.
[00:36:50.541 --> 00:36:56.424]  The Legislature of Texas has said no federally funded red light speed cameras in Texas.
[00:36:57.985 --> 00:37:04.388]  And I have the Texas Department of Transportation's own documents here in front of me.
[00:37:04.448 --> 00:37:08.209]  Text dot to install federally funded highway speed cameras.
[00:37:08.249 --> 00:37:09.190]  They just don't care.
[00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:13.252]  The same text dot told last year
[00:37:14.301 --> 00:37:22.308]  The state legislature, actually since 2005, but last year again, that they are not allowed to see any agreements TxDOT makes with foreign companies.
[00:37:22.868 --> 00:37:33.937]  But copies of the document, the agreement did leak, and it is the total handover of the entire freeway infrastructure to foreign interest for no money to put tolls on it for pure international profit.
[00:37:34.477 --> 00:37:35.738]  Total third world looting.
[00:37:36.239 --> 00:37:42.544]  Only in third world nations has this happened in the past, where they just come in, buy out the politicians, and they just hand over the lakes, the roads, the
[00:37:43.445 --> 00:37:43.805]  Everything.
[00:37:43.945 --> 00:37:44.666]  It's just been done.
[00:37:45.046 --> 00:37:49.869]  Now, I've got literally stacks of nightmare news in front of me, just out of control government.
[00:37:50.229 --> 00:37:54.071]  But I go with that first, just to illustrate how they just don't care.
[00:37:55.432 --> 00:38:01.775]  In major polls, 90 plus percent of Americans in 1993 were against NAFTA.
[00:38:02.596 --> 00:38:04.837]  Didn't matter, both parties were for it and they passed it.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:14.605]  90 plus percent in a major Gallup poll, one of the most respected this year, 91 percent, are against the amnesty plan.
[00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.747]  Republicans and Democrats don't care.
[00:38:17.188 --> 00:38:20.030]  They're going to continue to bring it up for re-votes until they pass it.
[00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:26.355]  And each time it doesn't pass, they say, that's it, you'll never see it again, you won, making everybody go to sleep.
[00:38:26.475 --> 00:38:30.519]  I'm getting emails saying that it was defeated, it doesn't exist, I'm a liar.
[00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:37.413]  I told you this last week, the Bush is at the Capitol right now, lobbying for total amnesty.
[00:38:38.173 --> 00:38:44.576]  It's more than amnesty, but again, I said I've got all this huge news, I don't even have ways to describe it to you.
[00:38:47.098 --> 00:38:51.960]  Coast to coast, police are now arresting citizens who hold up video cameras on them.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:39:00.124]  When the cops start wanting to search their cars, the cops arrest you and call it eavesdropping, while they have microphones on their chest, wired back to the camera in the car.
[00:39:01.812 --> 00:39:09.956]  By the way, there's no expectation of privacy when you're in public places.
[00:39:10.516 --> 00:39:14.038]  All of these have been thrown out of court when people fight them, but they just don't care now, you see.
[00:39:14.859 --> 00:39:15.579]  It's criminal.
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:23.163]  It's just wanton wiretapping, sneaking into your girlfriend's house when she breaks up with you, and putting a recorder in there.
[00:39:23.723 --> 00:39:27.425]  Now, those are real cases, and they use that as an example in this latest case.
[00:39:27.905 --> 00:39:30.046]  That's wiretapping, or the government illegally doing it.
[00:39:30.066 --> 00:39:31.447]  Of course, when they do it, they don't get in trouble.
[00:39:32.418 --> 00:39:34.358]  It's not having a camera in your car.
[00:39:37.439 --> 00:39:38.519]  But see, I'm digressing.
[00:39:38.539 --> 00:39:39.819]  You're saying, Alex, we tuned in.
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.280]  What is the big news?
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:53.682]  Last night, I'm sitting there and I'm reading the Associated Press with the headline, Bush, sure, amnesty bill will pass.
[00:39:54.942 --> 00:39:57.223]  Bush, sure, immigration reform will pass.
[00:40:00.541 --> 00:40:02.002]  And it was just everything together.
[00:40:02.042 --> 00:40:11.227]  I mean, the way they keep calling it in the media, immigration reform, and the people want things fixed, and the people want Congress to work well.
[00:40:11.848 --> 00:40:15.010]  Well, when it's in gridlock, and the government's small, that is working well.
[00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:24.795]  When it's government's exploding in size, and there's thousands of new laws a year just federally, and we're losing all our freedoms, and the feds are taking over the states, that's government working badly.
[00:40:26.296 --> 00:40:26.977]  But, oh no!
[00:40:27.777 --> 00:40:28.978]  They put on the masks, folks,
[00:40:31.019 --> 00:40:51.364]  All the Republican leaders and Democrat leaders together, they put on the hoax that it isn't an amnesty, then they put on the hoax that we beat it every week, and that it's never coming back, and then two days later announce, oh yeah, it is coming back, and they get more votes each time, and every time Bush has gone to Capitol Hill in twisted arms.
[00:40:52.784 --> 00:40:59.206]  By the way, they're just doing this to make you think there's a process, to make you think there's a fight.
[00:40:59.804 --> 00:41:01.626]  To at least put on a show.
[00:41:01.706 --> 00:41:03.068]  Believe me, I've seen this enough.
[00:41:04.449 --> 00:41:07.153]  They've got 99 Senators.
[00:41:07.593 --> 00:41:10.857]  When they want something like a Patriot Act or Patriot Act 2 passed, it happens.
[00:41:11.878 --> 00:41:14.161]  When they want an Iraq War Resolution, it happens.
[00:41:16.163 --> 00:41:17.645]  80 plus percent don't want the war.
[00:41:18.185 --> 00:41:20.568]  They do it and it isn't going to stop for a long time.
[00:41:23.559 --> 00:41:35.051]  And that's really the realization I came to, that it is completely lawless, it is completely criminal, and it's getting bigger, and it's getting more aggressive, and it isn't going to stop.
[00:41:36.413 --> 00:41:41.478]  Now, what's the big news that pushed me over the edge last night to really realize how dire the straits are?
[00:41:44.218 --> 00:41:48.139]  Well, first is this story that Steve Watson put together that's a compilation of all the mainstream news.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.341]  This story needs to be gotten out to everyone, and I mean now.
[00:41:52.861 --> 00:42:00.424]  We can post some article about some politician picking their nose.
[00:42:00.744 --> 00:42:01.724]  That's hypothetical.
[00:42:01.744 --> 00:42:03.385]  We don't put out such fluff, but you know what I mean.
[00:42:03.705 --> 00:42:08.066]  And it'll get 5,000 digs, and it'll get a million readers, and it'll have an effect.
[00:42:08.567 --> 00:42:12.448]  We can write earth-shattering articles of the greatest import.
[00:42:13.132 --> 00:42:16.174]  Literally, this is America-killing legislation.
[00:42:16.655 --> 00:42:21.278]  If they get this gun, this is ramming open the gates, literally in the siege.
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.241]  This is the Alamo falling, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:27.042 --> 00:42:30.504]  It doesn't mean that we still can't turn it around, but it means it's that much harder.
[00:42:30.784 --> 00:42:36.088]  I mean, we're that many more points down in the Super Bowl of life.
[00:42:41.591 --> 00:42:43.673]  Amnesty bill alive and well.
[00:42:44.313 --> 00:42:46.595]  Bush, sure, immigration reform bill will pass.
[00:42:46.635 --> 00:42:48.136]  Tax amnesty provision remains.
[00:42:48.696 --> 00:42:53.040]  Remember when he said, oh, I'm not going to lose in 2004, right before the election?
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.221]  Oh, I'm not going to lose.
[00:42:54.741 --> 00:42:55.802]  Oh, no, I'm going to win, no problem.
[00:42:56.122 --> 00:43:05.429]  That's because he knew it was going to be a rigged election nationwide, and the candidate he was running against was his cousin, his fraternity mate, and it was going to take a fall.
[00:43:06.667 --> 00:43:13.969]  See, it was rigged in that the Democrats are controlled, it was rigged in that the machines were rigged, and it was rigged in the candidate was going to take a dive.
[00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:18.811]  They had the triumphant, as they say, the trifecta.
[00:43:24.533 --> 00:43:27.294]  And then we spent a few days going, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[00:43:28.095 --> 00:43:41.618]  I mean, that's just like the enemy saying, OK, we're going to stop firing at you, we'll have a ceasefire, and the minute you, you know, your guys go and take a nap on the front lines in trench warfare, the minute you go take a nap, they launch the Tet Offensive during the ceasefire.
[00:43:42.899 --> 00:43:53.021]  You know, you go get drunk, you go smoke some pot, you go lay up in your hammock in your bunker, you go play gin rummy, and they hit the line.
[00:43:53.281 --> 00:43:55.562]  Their troops pour over the picket wire.
[00:43:57.606 --> 00:44:04.352]  And you buy it every single time, and I get slack-jawed emails going, Alex, you're being a little negative.
[00:44:04.392 --> 00:44:05.573]  Now, they did say we won.
[00:44:05.954 --> 00:44:07.975]  Why don't you go ahead and take off a little time?
[00:44:08.035 --> 00:44:10.738]  And I'm like, no, no, it's enemy tactic.
[00:44:11.398 --> 00:44:13.040]  I mean, we know how they operate.
[00:44:17.614 --> 00:44:21.275]  But still, I mean, the Feds tell us there's no planned assault on the Browns.
[00:44:21.655 --> 00:44:23.256]  The Feds say the FBI isn't involved.
[00:44:23.456 --> 00:44:25.376]  The Feds say they never had armored vehicles out there.
[00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:27.797]  And people, we're our own people, believe it!
[00:44:30.018 --> 00:44:31.338]  But let me tell the FBI something.
[00:44:31.598 --> 00:44:35.299]  You believe the propaganda about the value of the dollar and about your house and about your future.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.381]  You believe your own bull, too.
[00:44:42.121 --> 00:44:43.682]  You believe that vaccine's good for you.
[00:44:44.318 --> 00:44:46.879]  Because Alex Jones is a liar and you're going to trust the government.
[00:44:46.919 --> 00:44:48.120]  Well, go ahead then, cop!
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.141]  Curse yourself!
[00:44:50.181 --> 00:44:52.922]  See, you punish yourselves.
[00:44:53.102 --> 00:44:54.323]  I don't have to do anything to you.
[00:44:59.926 --> 00:45:01.827]  Amnesty bill alive and well.
[00:45:03.267 --> 00:45:05.248]  Bush, sure immigration reform bill will pass.
[00:45:05.648 --> 00:45:07.029]  And then I read this article.
[00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:10.011]  And then I read all the hyperlinks to it.
[00:45:10.451 --> 00:45:11.691]  I probably read 15 stories.
[00:45:12.172 --> 00:45:12.712]  Sped read them.
[00:45:13.533 --> 00:45:15.394]  And then I went over and I read the newest article.
[00:45:17.714 --> 00:45:18.034]  U.S.
[00:45:18.174 --> 00:45:28.798]  Army Pushes for Amnesty Bill Fast Track So It Can Recruit Illegal Aliens Treasonous Army Failed to Reach Recruitment Targets for May Turns to Illegals.
[00:45:30.718 --> 00:45:32.739]  Now when I say treason, I mean it.
[00:45:33.279 --> 00:45:35.520]  This is not our military officially.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.721]  This is not our government officially.
[00:45:41.787 --> 00:45:49.450]  Over 20% a year ago, the Army Ground Force in Iraq, headline, Mexico, US's secret weapon in Iraq.
[00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:50.231]  Go pull it up.
[00:45:52.652 --> 00:45:55.113]  We're talking AP, Boston Globe, Reuters.
[00:45:57.374 --> 00:45:59.975]  20 plus percent was already Mexican nationals.
[00:46:00.455 --> 00:46:00.795]  Okay?
[00:46:04.557 --> 00:46:07.858]  They expanded recruiting stations from Manila to Mexico City.
[00:46:09.622 --> 00:46:11.583]  All over the Pacific, all over Eastern Europe.
[00:46:12.643 --> 00:46:14.263]  They don't need to bring in spitsnats.
[00:46:14.363 --> 00:46:15.403]  Folks, they're hiring them.
[00:46:17.964 --> 00:46:22.325]  You know, I got footage from 95 when they've got spitsnats trying to take your guns.
[00:46:24.786 --> 00:46:27.286]  But they hire them and they pay them bonus money and they're here.
[00:46:28.087 --> 00:46:29.087]  And let me tell you something.
[00:46:30.547 --> 00:46:35.409]  They'll line you and your family up and they'll blow your heads off all day long.
[00:46:35.709 --> 00:46:36.889]  And they'll last for seconds.
[00:46:38.323 --> 00:46:39.743]  And these Mexicans will too.
[00:46:42.664 --> 00:47:02.769]  But to see the criminals in the government, to see the Army Brass, the head of NORTHCOM, that guy's pure evil, to know that they really are doing it, they really are destroying the dollar by design, they really are getting rid of the sovereignty by design, they really are destroying our
[00:47:03.897 --> 00:47:08.279]  Military, and all of its free decor, and all of its illustrious history.
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:17.343]  I mean, Caesar really is bringing in the foreign hordes to police Rome, which many Caesars did, in its final decline.
[00:47:18.003 --> 00:47:21.084]  Foreign tribes to suppress the Roman citizens and start looting them.
[00:47:21.404 --> 00:47:23.265]  In the final decline, that's what happened.
[00:47:24.686 --> 00:47:26.066]  They started stealing from each other.
[00:47:26.386 --> 00:47:27.967]  Senators started stealing from each other.
[00:47:28.727 --> 00:47:30.648]  You foolish FBI and the rest of you.
[00:47:31.377 --> 00:47:34.159]  I mean, prima facie evidence of high treason.
[00:47:34.179 --> 00:47:40.063]  I mean, we knew it was high treason when Bush signed the SPP, North American Union Agreement, in secret.
[00:47:40.284 --> 00:47:50.631]  Then they said the agreement was secret, but we got drafts of it that were circulated at the SPP meeting a year later in Banff, Banff, however you pronounce it, Canada.
[00:47:52.492 --> 00:47:55.314]  And it shows they're going to use foreign troops on our streets and foreign police.
[00:47:57.996 --> 00:47:59.377]  And it says we're a North American Union.
[00:47:59.417 --> 00:48:00.278]  You know, that's treason.
[00:48:01.699 --> 00:48:25.599]  But to learn that the Pentagon used its lobbying arm, which is even bigger than Israel's, it's the biggest lobbying arm, the government lobbies itself, and then learn that the Pentagon is lobbying and using defense contractors to lobby, and that hundreds of millions are being spent, it's all mainstream news right here in front of me, that the Pentagon is lobbying to end
[00:48:26.918 --> 00:48:36.383]  Our borders, to end our sovereignty, to legalize 30 million illegal aliens and allow them to bring in 11 of their family members and it legalizes them all for 12 years.
[00:48:36.403 --> 00:48:38.204]  They're instantly given social security cards.
[00:48:38.665 --> 00:48:42.307]  On average, they get triple the welfare of any tax they pay.
[00:48:44.228 --> 00:48:45.569]  Let me say it to you slowly.
[00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:49.151]  The so-called U.S.
[00:48:49.331 --> 00:48:54.914]  Army and Pentagon and the defense contractors, who by the way are all moving offshore,
[00:48:57.791 --> 00:49:01.092]  Are literally gutting America like a fat hog right now.
[00:49:01.712 --> 00:49:04.873]  And let me tell you something, you stupid yuppies in your million dollar houses.
[00:49:05.593 --> 00:49:14.736]  Let me tell you something, right now, you dumb fools, you are not part of the elite, and this is all being done so they can take everything you've got, you jackasses!
[00:49:15.997 --> 00:49:26.760]  If you just wake up and say no to all this, and quit feeling like you are members of the elite, because some congressman had dinner with you at the country club once, and patted you on the head, that's called statescraft,
[00:49:28.337 --> 00:49:34.762]  If you get mad and make phone calls, then you're the people they actually listen to, because you gave $50,000 last year in political contributions.
[00:49:35.703 --> 00:49:38.885]  If you would stand up for America now, we could save it.
[00:49:39.085 --> 00:49:42.308]  But I've had dinner with you two, and I've talked to you, and I've read the crap you write.
[00:49:42.988 --> 00:49:45.090]  And I know that you go, oh, it's part of globalism.
[00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:46.451]  Yeah, we need these workers.
[00:49:46.931 --> 00:49:47.812]  Yeah, it's good.
[00:49:47.892 --> 00:49:48.953]  I'm a corporate chief.
[00:49:49.053 --> 00:49:52.736]  I run a little company, you know, a billion-dollar company, which is small, by the way.
[00:49:54.077 --> 00:49:57.039]  And I'm an elitist, and this is just how we do things.
[00:49:57.179 --> 00:49:57.920]  You idiot!
[00:49:58.678 --> 00:50:01.480]  You are blowing out what's left of old Rome!
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:07.163]  Even if you're just evil and want to sit up on top of an empire, do you realize we've been triple-crossed?
[00:50:07.683 --> 00:50:08.744]  Quadruple-crossed?
[00:50:09.304 --> 00:50:11.105]  And that we're totally being blown out?
[00:50:11.726 --> 00:50:19.390]  This isn't Andrew Jackson's America, and the guy did kill a bunch of natives and did do a bunch of things that could be called bad today, but think of the world he was in.
[00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:24.633]  He did at least owe allegiance to the U.S., and he did think about the actual people of the country.
[00:50:28.457 --> 00:50:32.080]  He at least had allegiance because he knew where the power came from.
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:33.081]  He was tribal.
[00:50:35.002 --> 00:50:36.423]  These people running America aren't.
[00:50:36.463 --> 00:50:37.924]  They're cold mechanical.
[00:50:39.425 --> 00:50:41.587]  And it's just unbelievable.
[00:50:42.528 --> 00:50:43.068]  Think about it.
[00:50:44.395 --> 00:50:46.456]  The military is lobbying to end America.
[00:50:46.736 --> 00:50:47.296]  The U.S.
[00:50:47.336 --> 00:50:49.417]  military is attacking America.
[00:50:49.637 --> 00:50:54.540]  They all, every high-level officer, they all need to be arrested right now.
[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:55.860]  Bush, all of them.
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.382]  You are all enemies of the Republic.
[00:50:58.822 --> 00:50:59.122]  Boom!
[00:51:04.731 --> 00:51:10.214]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.575 --> 00:51:18.219]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.914 --> 00:51:25.978]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.378 --> 00:51:37.804]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.104 --> 00:51:41.686]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.067 --> 00:51:44.008]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.328 --> 00:51:48.170]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:03.078 --> 00:52:04.118]  The war on terrorism.
[00:52:04.439 --> 00:52:07.220]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.643]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:52:12.083 --> 00:52:12.903]  So what do you do?
[00:52:13.223 --> 00:52:17.786]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:52:18.266 --> 00:52:20.388]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:52:20.888 --> 00:52:21.789]  Sheltering in Place!
[00:52:22.189 --> 00:52:35.599]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:53:01.331 --> 00:53:03.052]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:03.273 --> 00:53:06.975]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:07.296 --> 00:53:16.243]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:16.383 --> 00:53:21.306]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.507 --> 00:53:23.268]  Every time you walk away from your computer,
[00:53:23.268 --> 00:53:23.548]  I don't know.
[00:53:38.573 --> 00:53:39.213]  I think so.
[00:54:09.768 --> 00:54:13.651]  Henson works pretty much full-time, but really part-time here in the office.
[00:54:13.671 --> 00:54:18.395]  He's also going to be a well-known country singer, country gold here in town.
[00:54:19.236 --> 00:54:31.586]  And he just got out of the Air Force a while back, and he was in there listening to the show during the last segment, and he goes, yeah, on the bass, they've got their own areas, their own basic training.
[00:54:31.786 --> 00:54:37.451]  Well, instead of me just putting it in my words, Weldon, tell folks about it.
[00:54:38.548 --> 00:54:48.474]  Well, basically, you know, I won't say the exact basis of where I saw it, but, you know, they'd bring over Mexican recruits or whatever and they would put them through their own little special basic training.
[00:54:48.494 --> 00:54:49.955]  They have their own special programs.
[00:54:50.375 --> 00:55:02.983]  They've got instructors that are, you know, basically from our military that teach them English, teach them the American ways, and get them prepared to go through our actual, you know, basic trainings.
[00:55:03.868 --> 00:55:05.173]  So it's a pre-basic training?
[00:55:05.253 --> 00:55:06.317]  Yeah, they put them through.
[00:55:06.337 --> 00:55:08.505]  And this is the Air Force?
[00:55:09.213 --> 00:55:11.115]  Air Force, yeah, and Army.
[00:55:11.315 --> 00:55:12.676]  I've seen it for the Air Force and Army.
[00:55:12.716 --> 00:55:14.617]  I didn't see the Navy or Marines.
[00:55:14.717 --> 00:55:17.759]  So when you were in the Air Force, you were next to Army bases, I guess, or in them?
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:21.142]  Well, you know, on bases, a lot of bases have all of them, yeah.
[00:55:21.162 --> 00:55:25.125]  They have all the branches on a base sometimes, you know, different little divisions.
[00:55:25.605 --> 00:55:35.132]  And they've opened huge recruiting centers in the Philippines, Mexico, over 20% of the Army now in Iraq was illegal alien or foreigner.
[00:55:35.872 --> 00:55:37.934]  Does that sound like freedom to you?
[00:55:38.909 --> 00:55:41.611]  No, I personally think you should be a U.S.
[00:55:41.631 --> 00:55:52.397]  citizen to serve this country, but I saw it all the time, you know, guys from our military, they're trained to go train, you know, people that aren't U.S.
[00:55:52.437 --> 00:55:53.738]  citizens to be in the military.
[00:55:54.545 --> 00:55:55.025]  Kind of weird.
[00:55:55.225 --> 00:56:07.448]  What do you think about the Army and the Pentagon spending all this money to lobby, again, our military involved lobbying our government to block the will of 90 plus percent of the American people and legalize 30 million illegal aliens?
[00:56:07.848 --> 00:56:08.649]  That's ludicrous.
[00:56:09.509 --> 00:56:10.029]  Absolutely.
[00:56:10.829 --> 00:56:12.090]  I didn't know it was that crazy.
[00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:16.251]  We see it done every day in the military, but we don't think nothing of it.
[00:56:16.851 --> 00:56:21.452]  Basically, you just kind of go about your business and it's totally crazy, I think.
[00:56:22.034 --> 00:56:22.554]  It's amazing.
[00:56:22.594 --> 00:56:23.575]  Thanks for talking to us, Weldon.
[00:56:24.215 --> 00:56:24.935]  I appreciate it, man.
[00:56:25.756 --> 00:56:28.097]  Folks, this is high treason, period.
[00:56:28.137 --> 00:56:29.437]  There's no debating.
[00:56:29.457 --> 00:56:32.719]  And I want you to go up to PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:56:33.699 --> 00:56:35.860]  I want you to go up to PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:37.741]  And I want you to read, U.S.
[00:56:37.841 --> 00:56:41.322]  Army Pushes for Amnesty Bill Fast Track So It Can Recruit Illegal Aliens.
[00:56:41.743 --> 00:56:45.444]  Treasonous Army Failed to Reach Recruitment Targets in May, Turns to Illegals.
[00:56:45.744 --> 00:56:47.605]  That's the media spinning that they just turned to them.
[00:56:47.865 --> 00:56:49.606]  It's already over 20% in the Army, okay?
[00:56:49.626 --> 00:56:50.446]  That's a year-old number.
[00:56:50.767 --> 00:56:51.567]  It's accelerating.
[00:56:52.443 --> 00:56:59.128]  There have been some projections, in fact there was testimony earlier this year in front of the Armed Services Committee, where they talked about half the Army being illegal alien.
[00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:03.271]  And by the way, they're recruiting aggravated felons.
[00:57:04.372 --> 00:57:14.419]  The development of relief and education for alien minors, their dream provision in the immigration bill, was expected to help boost military recruiting by allowing illegal aliens to enlist as a way to obtain citizenship.
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:15.460]  They're already doing it.
[00:57:16.175 --> 00:57:16.956]  A senior U.S.
[00:57:16.976 --> 00:57:23.961]  defense official today urged the Congress to fast-track the section of the stalled immigration bill that would allow the military to recruit illegal aliens.
[00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:25.081]  They're already doing it.
[00:57:26.062 --> 00:57:26.382]  Okay?
[00:57:26.402 --> 00:57:27.283]  They're already doing it.
[00:57:27.903 --> 00:57:29.164]  See, this is how they do it in the media.
[00:57:29.484 --> 00:57:30.925]  They report it after it's being done.
[00:57:31.726 --> 00:57:35.889]  After recruiting failures released by the Pentagon show the Army failed to reach its targets for May.
[00:57:36.528 --> 00:57:47.113]  In other words, and by the way, we knew this, I remember Special Forces retired commanders on air 10 years ago, Alex, their secret program was to use Latin Americans to oppress the American people.
[00:57:47.654 --> 00:57:48.774]  Remember Celica Stilub?
[00:57:50.755 --> 00:57:59.800]  Army sniper, Vietnam, police officer, border patrol guard, then DEA, then the highest level DEA agent for all of Latin America.
[00:58:00.487 --> 00:58:05.109]  Of course, there were only 20 or 30 of them, but the point is he was the commander, and he saw the government shipping the cocaine in.
[00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:15.335]  Well, he'll tell you that the Los Zetas, the former paramilitary Mexicans, have been hired by the CIA, and they're training in South Texas, and they go around doing CIA hits all over America.
[00:58:16.755 --> 00:58:23.299]  By the way, he told you a year before it was in the news that our government's using former Latin American death squads in Iraq to run death squad ops.
[00:58:23.699 --> 00:58:27.661]  They're going to use Latin American death squads in America, commanded by traitors.
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:33.021]  Led by FBI squads, just like you saw in Katrina.
[00:58:33.602 --> 00:58:34.502]  It's high treason.
[00:58:35.082 --> 00:58:36.723]  Our military has turned against us.
[00:58:37.023 --> 00:58:37.843]  This is war.
[00:58:38.103 --> 00:58:40.284]  The military has declared war on the American people.
[00:58:41.984 --> 00:58:46.206]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:58.004 --> 00:59:02.167]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.828 --> 00:59:03.648]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.409 --> 00:59:05.309]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.329 --> 00:59:09.933]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.153 --> 00:59:14.276]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.016 --> 00:59:24.183]  Randy Weaver is going to join us for 30 minutes of the next hour to talk about the escalating siege of the Brown property going on up in New Hampshire.
[00:59:25.046 --> 00:59:33.372]  Kevin Woods going to join us talking about this new phenomenon of police videotaping them, arresting you, as they mount cameras everywhere to track us.
[00:59:34.533 --> 00:59:35.434]  It's totally criminal.
[00:59:36.294 --> 00:59:38.496]  Raymond Schwab was rescheduled twice.
[00:59:38.576 --> 00:59:42.199]  He had his son seized by CPS for being involved in 9-11 Truth.
[00:59:42.219 --> 00:59:44.801]  We'll be joining us for a segment or two in the next segment.
[00:59:44.821 --> 00:59:47.102]  I'm going to get back into our top story.
[00:59:47.803 --> 00:59:51.646]  Not only is over 20% of the ground force in the Army in Iraq,
[00:59:52.481 --> 00:59:53.242]  That is in the Army.
[00:59:53.282 --> 00:59:54.383]  We've got the numbers on the Marines.
[00:59:54.423 --> 00:59:54.923]  It's a little over 15%.
[00:59:55.003 --> 00:59:57.786]  Illegal alien that were legalized.
[00:59:59.327 --> 01:00:01.069]  Now they're trying to increase that number.
[01:00:01.569 --> 01:00:04.112]  And the Pentagon is lobbying and asking Congress.
[01:00:04.132 --> 01:00:07.615]  They're lobbying today with President Bush, saying it's a patriotic duty.
[01:00:07.795 --> 01:00:11.979]  See, you're not patriotic now if you don't want to legalize 30 million illegals and recruit illegal aliens.
[01:00:13.143 --> 01:00:14.504]  And they're saying they need these recruits.
[01:00:14.524 --> 01:00:15.925]  They've already got the recruiting stations.
[01:00:16.165 --> 01:00:17.246]  They're lying to Congress.
[01:00:17.266 --> 01:00:26.994]  The Congressmen are so dumb or so busy with their mistresses that most of them probably don't even know they've had recruiting stations for six years in Mexico City and all over the world.
[01:00:28.777 --> 01:00:32.379]  And they're saying, it's your patriotic duty!
[01:00:32.459 --> 01:00:33.519]  That's literally how they talk.
[01:00:33.799 --> 01:00:36.001]  And then it just, it's like mind control with the good ol' boys.
[01:00:36.041 --> 01:00:39.122]  They just go, I gotta have foreign troops from America.
[01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:40.343]  It's the Patriot!
[01:00:40.363 --> 01:00:42.824]  I mean, literally, it's mind control, you idiots.
[01:00:44.845 --> 01:00:45.885]  It's literally in the news.
[01:00:45.925 --> 01:00:47.066]  There's headlines.
[01:00:47.486 --> 01:00:49.047]  It's the patriotic thing to do.
[01:00:49.447 --> 01:00:50.948]  We don't have enough troops.
[01:00:51.788 --> 01:00:54.630]  We need total immigration legalization.
[01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:57.491]  We need the amnesty bill.
[01:00:58.334 --> 01:01:01.396]  Which again, they told you in Military Tactics last week, was dead.
[01:01:01.756 --> 01:01:02.397]  It's not dead.
[01:01:02.657 --> 01:01:05.018]  Bush is on Capitol Hill right now.
[01:01:06.379 --> 01:01:09.621]  And he says it will pass and snickered to the cameras.
[01:01:10.822 --> 01:01:13.583]  Just like he did before the 2004 election.
[01:01:13.823 --> 01:01:15.184]  Because he knows the fix is in.
[01:01:15.524 --> 01:01:17.506]  And I just want you to prepare for this to pass.
[01:01:18.546 --> 01:01:19.467]  I want you to prepare.
[01:01:20.716 --> 01:01:28.041]  And by the way, folks, I mean, if half the population of Austin was illegal aliens a year ago, it's got to be 75% now.
[01:01:28.341 --> 01:01:34.524]  You can go to North Austin, West Austin, East Austin, South Austin, it'll be 10 to 1 illegal aliens to American citizens.
[01:01:34.564 --> 01:01:35.785]  I mean, they're just everywhere.
[01:01:36.786 --> 01:01:39.027]  I think 30 million is below numbers.
[01:01:39.467 --> 01:01:47.292]  The Mexican census is 100 million Mexicans, and that was six years ago, the last census, and they admit that about 30% of them, the Mexican government says, live here.
[01:01:48.721 --> 01:01:49.843]  Okay, so that's 30 million.
[01:01:49.883 --> 01:01:50.805]  That's the Mexican numbers.
[01:01:50.825 --> 01:01:51.806]  That's where we get those numbers.
[01:01:52.147 --> 01:01:53.929]  Our media license is 14 mil.
[01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:55.572]  It's over 30 mil.
[01:01:56.093 --> 01:01:57.034]  And that was last year.
[01:01:57.515 --> 01:01:59.178]  It's got to have increased massively.
[01:01:59.518 --> 01:02:00.560]  I've never seen anything like it.
[01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:05.111]  I've never seen anything like it, and it's economic warfare to blow up.
[01:02:05.211 --> 01:02:09.433]  I mean, I just heard today, Derry Brownfield was reading an AP article.
[01:02:09.773 --> 01:02:13.235]  Hershey's is leaving Hershey, Pennsylvania to Mexico.
[01:02:13.535 --> 01:02:15.316]  We can't even make candy bars here.
[01:02:15.776 --> 01:02:22.559]  Thousands of McDonald's have started where you give your order at the window to a satellite link to somebody in India.
[01:02:22.999 --> 01:02:26.920]  We always joked that pretty soon they'd make the hamburgers in India or China.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.722]  Well, if they could teleport stuff, they would.
[01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:40.010]  It's economic warfare, it's risk, economic risk game, where it's about blowing out economies, blowing out competition, it's not free market.
[01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:47.718]  It's about using governments and slave wages and regulations in the Western world to drive out any industry to get full control.
[01:02:47.778 --> 01:02:51.001]  The West is the enemy of the elite because the elite
[01:02:51.938 --> 01:02:52.979]  Rose out of the West
[01:03:21.718 --> 01:03:23.520]  We're good to go.
[01:03:42.965 --> 01:03:46.266]  And, uh, they are openly waging war against the borders and the sovereignty.
[01:03:46.567 --> 01:03:47.987]  The military's turned against us.
[01:03:48.247 --> 01:03:49.588]  It's happened many times in the past.
[01:03:49.808 --> 01:03:50.928]  They are treasonous traitors.
[01:03:51.088 --> 01:03:52.309]  They are attacking the Republic.
[01:03:52.449 --> 01:03:53.069]  They are enemies.
[01:03:53.169 --> 01:03:53.649]  Tell everybody!
[01:03:53.669 --> 01:03:59.912]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:00.252 --> 01:04:02.213]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.573 --> 01:04:10.196]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.908 --> 01:04:17.952]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.373 --> 01:04:29.820]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:34.042]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.062 --> 01:04:35.983]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.323 --> 01:04:40.106]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:06.597 --> 01:05:10.079]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria
[01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:14.561]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:05:14.841 --> 01:05:18.782]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:05:19.022 --> 01:05:25.525]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:05:25.765 --> 01:05:31.247]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:31.487 --> 01:05:36.069]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system.
[01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:38.412]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[01:05:43.158 --> 01:05:44.100]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:55.228 --> 01:05:59.350]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:05:59.571 --> 01:06:01.332]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:06:01.592 --> 01:06:07.895]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:06:08.175 --> 01:06:14.299]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:06:14.539 --> 01:06:16.340]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:17.480]  We're good to go.
[01:06:39.165 --> 01:06:40.605]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:08.651 --> 01:07:18.717]  See, everybody thinks Pat Buchanan and Lou Dobbs, and I'm not attacking them, I'm just saying, everybody thinks, ooh, they're hardcore.
[01:07:19.978 --> 01:07:27.984]  With articles out today about this amnesty deal being for the New World Order and how Bush is going to pass it and keep trying to pass it no matter what we do.
[01:07:28.004 --> 01:07:31.546]  Everybody thinks it's so hardcore, and ooh, they're telling the truth.
[01:07:32.126 --> 01:07:34.348]  Folks, it is 50 times worse, okay?
[01:07:36.036 --> 01:07:41.721]  The military designed the cameras, the tracking grids, the highways, everything they put in.
[01:07:42.982 --> 01:08:03.878]  The military is controlled and lobbied by now foreign offshore defense contractors that hate the United States, that have moved offshore and are doing everything they can to lobby even down to small city governments to pay the majority of the tax money in to private investment funds.
[01:08:05.026 --> 01:08:07.188]  It's called the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
[01:08:07.228 --> 01:08:10.632]  That's the documents that are with every county, city, water district.
[01:08:11.693 --> 01:08:15.837]  They've gotten over 75% of the economy now offshore just in investments.
[01:08:16.337 --> 01:08:18.640]  They've gotten over 80% of the industry offshore.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:22.604]  Now, it took 20-30 years for that to happen.
[01:08:22.664 --> 01:08:26.728]  Now, more offshore movements happened in the last year than happened in the previous 10.
[01:08:27.048 --> 01:08:27.929]  I've looked up the numbers.
[01:08:27.989 --> 01:08:28.990]  I mean, it's massive.
[01:08:29.511 --> 01:08:30.651]  And I'm just generalizing here.
[01:08:30.691 --> 01:08:33.232]  It's just total acceleration.
[01:08:33.632 --> 01:08:34.492]  Everything's leaving.
[01:08:34.792 --> 01:08:38.433]  From Hershey to Halliburton to defense contractors.
[01:08:38.953 --> 01:08:43.334]  I mean, it is a mad, screaming dash out of the country.
[01:08:44.454 --> 01:08:46.434]  And they just wrap themselves in the flag.
[01:08:46.454 --> 01:08:48.015]  Any time you question them, they go, flag!
[01:08:48.335 --> 01:08:49.215]  Flag, America!
[01:08:49.235 --> 01:08:52.456]  You go, hey, you're selling out America.
[01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:53.696]  Oh, we're for America!
[01:08:54.654 --> 01:09:00.116]  And all these fake neocon talk shows constantly, you're a good American, you're a great American, you're a great American.
[01:09:00.576 --> 01:09:02.156]  They know what they're doing.
[01:09:02.176 --> 01:09:04.097]  And I just want you to know who did all this to you.
[01:09:04.657 --> 01:09:14.319]  As things get worse and worse, as it all falls apart, the very people that did it are going to be up there grandstanding and you'll have to hear people at church parrot what they said and who they blame it on.
[01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:15.280]  It'll be some 35 year old
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:19.802]  You know, account executive in Malaysia or something.
[01:09:20.162 --> 01:09:23.565]  It's some British company who made a trade and it caused a trigger reaction.
[01:09:23.585 --> 01:09:26.126]  You know, they've always got some bull story for you.
[01:09:26.146 --> 01:09:29.729]  They'll claim a cow kicked over a lantern or something.
[01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:31.230]  I mean, you know how they do.
[01:09:33.651 --> 01:09:43.818]  And I just want you to know that it is high treason, I mean high treason, to sign the North American Union two years and three months ago in secret.
[01:09:44.178 --> 01:09:45.599]  It's even bigger treason.
[01:09:46.704 --> 01:09:47.724]  Let me state this to you again.
[01:09:49.445 --> 01:09:51.106]  And again, I missed the forest for the trees.
[01:09:51.246 --> 01:09:53.887]  I knew over 20% of our army was foreigners, mainly Mexican.
[01:09:54.427 --> 01:09:55.407]  Illegal aliens legalized.
[01:09:55.747 --> 01:09:57.388]  I knew they were hiring aggravated felons.
[01:09:58.048 --> 01:09:59.108]  I learned that five years ago.
[01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:05.010]  Now this new amnesty legalizes aggravated felons for recruitment.
[01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:12.553]  They're not just going to recruit and change our military over to drone aircraft that the globalists can control without somebody bucking orders.
[01:10:13.707 --> 01:10:19.492]  But the manpower is going to be illegal aliens who are being trained for gun confiscation, and I got video of it.
[01:10:19.932 --> 01:10:26.577]  I mean, this is the classic deal, where they bring in foreigners and train them for house-to-house searches, checkpoints, gun confiscation.
[01:10:26.797 --> 01:10:35.164]  They'll get live-action training in Iraq or Macedonia or 130-something other countries that the foreign military that occupies us is occupying.
[01:10:35.384 --> 01:10:36.345]  This is not our military.
[01:10:36.855 --> 01:10:39.636]  They got our flag on their arms, but that's it.
[01:10:40.136 --> 01:10:41.057]  They are traitors.
[01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:42.777]  They are enemies of America.
[01:10:43.218 --> 01:10:49.560]  And I'm going to tell you just right now that I don't want to get your email saying, well, my son's in there, and that's a little too harsh.
[01:10:51.601 --> 01:10:58.564]  This would be like 1940 and being in the Nazi military, being in the German military.
[01:10:59.704 --> 01:11:01.105]  This is not the German military.
[01:11:01.745 --> 01:11:02.945]  This is the Nazi military.
[01:11:03.345 --> 01:11:04.326]  And this is not the U.S.
[01:11:04.346 --> 01:11:04.766]  military.
[01:11:05.564 --> 01:11:07.625]  Folks, they're already under UN control.
[01:11:07.645 --> 01:11:09.226]  They're already under international agreements.
[01:11:09.306 --> 01:11:10.407]  It's all come home to roost.
[01:11:10.747 --> 01:11:13.469]  Everything the old-timers warned us about is now happening.
[01:11:13.489 --> 01:11:14.649]  Let me give you a little newsflash.
[01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:15.410]  Mayday!
[01:11:15.670 --> 01:11:16.811]  Mayday!
[01:11:17.071 --> 01:11:17.511]  Mayday!
[01:11:17.771 --> 01:11:18.231]  Mayday!
[01:11:18.512 --> 01:11:18.972]  Mayday!
[01:11:19.232 --> 01:11:19.672]  Mayday!
[01:11:19.932 --> 01:11:20.373]  Mayday!
[01:11:20.653 --> 01:11:21.093]  Mayday!
[01:11:21.373 --> 01:11:21.833]  Mayday!
[01:11:21.914 --> 01:11:22.934]  This is real.
[01:11:23.234 --> 01:11:24.455]  This is happening.
[01:11:25.776 --> 01:11:34.741]  But when I opened it up and I saw the newspaper last night and they were admitting that the military is lobbying and spending money and defense contractors are spending money.
[01:11:35.842 --> 01:11:50.763]  They take our tax money to pay for overpriced weapons systems so they can spend the very money we pay in taxes to then go lobby the government to end America.
[01:11:51.003 --> 01:11:51.885]  And that's what this is!
[01:11:52.751 --> 01:11:57.835]  Our own government for 60 years has been paying the Mexicans to put out textbooks saying this is Mexico.
[01:11:58.336 --> 01:12:01.678]  Public schools from California to Texas have been in the newspaper teaching it.
[01:12:02.159 --> 01:12:05.541]  The illegal aliens are chomping at the bit, full of their brainwashing.
[01:12:05.561 --> 01:12:08.864]  They're taking down American flags at post offices and schools nationwide.
[01:12:09.204 --> 01:12:09.925]  If an American
[01:12:10.965 --> 01:12:14.366]  One case, a Hispanic young man went and takes it down and puts up the American flag.
[01:12:14.406 --> 01:12:16.846]  They're arrested by the punk cops.
[01:12:17.426 --> 01:12:19.247]  The illegal aliens don't have to have IDs.
[01:12:19.507 --> 01:12:20.587]  They get to drunk drive.
[01:12:20.807 --> 01:12:23.788]  They don't get arrested, but American citizens do for petty reasons.
[01:12:24.188 --> 01:12:29.289]  I'm telling you folks, the Browns don't get tax amnesty, but the illegal aliens do.
[01:12:29.309 --> 01:12:30.669]  Do you got it?
[01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:32.629]  They're gutting us like a fat hog.
[01:12:34.330 --> 01:12:39.991]  And using Mexico as a rook in a chess game against our underbelly is the key to what they're doing.
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:44.281]  They are destroying America right now.
[01:12:44.601 --> 01:12:46.442]  The country is going down right now.
[01:12:46.842 --> 01:12:49.003]  This is high treason.
[01:12:50.384 --> 01:12:50.624]  U.S.
[01:12:50.704 --> 01:12:54.946]  Army pushes for amnesty bill, fast track so it can recruit illegal aliens.
[01:12:55.486 --> 01:12:59.347]  Treasonous Army failed to reach recruitment targets for May, turns to illegals.
[01:12:59.888 --> 01:13:00.548]  A senior U.S.
[01:13:00.568 --> 01:13:02.649]  defense official today, it's not U.S.
[01:13:02.689 --> 01:13:02.969]  defense.
[01:13:02.989 --> 01:13:04.530]  We need to stop using their terms.
[01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:07.411]  That's just as big a lie as saying this is an amnesty.
[01:13:08.286 --> 01:13:09.366]  Calling it a reform bill.
[01:13:09.626 --> 01:13:11.927]  It's just as big a lie as saying the Browns weren't under siege.
[01:13:12.167 --> 01:13:14.587]  It's just as big a lie as saying Mercury's good for you.
[01:13:14.847 --> 01:13:17.468]  They've learned to just bald-faced lie and you buy it.
[01:13:18.448 --> 01:13:20.848]  It is a lie to call it our military.
[01:13:21.529 --> 01:13:22.829]  I'm not going to call it that anymore.
[01:13:22.869 --> 01:13:26.089]  We have to totally re-change our language now.
[01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:34.231]  The only law enforcement in this country that was pro-America and engaged in defense of this country was our Border Patrol.
[01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:44.874]  And what did they do to the only real defenders of the country, by the way, who get some of the lowest pay and the toughest job?
[01:13:45.455 --> 01:13:46.835]  They demonize them on the news.
[01:13:48.056 --> 01:13:51.318]  Tommy Lee Jones makes movies putting down the Border Patrol.
[01:13:51.718 --> 01:13:52.519]  They sue them.
[01:13:52.859 --> 01:13:55.281]  When they get shot at or they shoot back, they go to prison.
[01:13:55.461 --> 01:13:57.002]  They're not allowed to chase vehicles.
[01:13:58.522 --> 01:14:00.444]  If they shoot a fleeing car, they go to prison.
[01:14:00.644 --> 01:14:04.226]  But you can gun down a toddler in the street and it's fine if you're a cop doing it to an American.
[01:14:06.855 --> 01:14:21.270]  They tell them you can sit here in your truck and you can look one direction, whichever direction we tell you, north, south, east or west, but if you see illegals on the other points of the compass, the other three points of the compass or anywhere between, you're not allowed to even call it in.
[01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:23.492]  By the way, that's been a policy for five years.
[01:14:24.921 --> 01:14:35.063]  By the way, you've got to spend half your time in 110 degree brush, filled with rattlesnakes, copperheads and coral snakes, picking up trash left by the illegals.
[01:14:35.543 --> 01:14:37.024]  That's just to burn up the rest of their time.
[01:14:38.064 --> 01:14:46.486]  And then, oh by the way, we'll give you $100,000 a year extra to go serve in Iraq and control their border, where they built fences, or Afghanistan.
[01:14:46.786 --> 01:14:53.147]  Or by the way, we'll give you $24,000 increase starting a year on what you're getting to go be an air marshal and sit there on planes.
[01:14:54.139 --> 01:14:55.419]  We have 2,000 less.
[01:14:55.719 --> 01:14:57.020]  That was the last numbers I got.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.000]  I'm told it's worse than we did a few years ago.
[01:14:59.020 --> 01:14:59.900]  I'm about to go to our guest.
[01:15:04.141 --> 01:15:07.162]  It's his bad fortune that this happened to him during the biggest news cycle ever.
[01:15:10.762 --> 01:15:10.902]  U.S.
[01:15:10.982 --> 01:15:15.783]  Army pushes for amnesty bill fast track so it can't recruit illegal aliens.
[01:15:17.644 --> 01:15:18.884]  All of this is going on
[01:15:20.695 --> 01:15:24.720]  And they go build a couple miles of fence and say it's 700 and Homeland Security blocks it.
[01:15:27.624 --> 01:15:32.190]  And they do everything they can, ladies and gentlemen, because they gotta bring this country down.
[01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:34.653]  To use it as an engine of world government.
[01:15:35.485 --> 01:16:03.386]  ...and to destroy the economy, and they're setting up, Denver's setting up living, breathing taxes, whole new levels of taxes that are going to make the income tax and sales tax look tame, total brainwashing in the schools, taking children to teach them about homosexualities in the news today, I mean young'uns, taking them to Planned Parenthood to teach them how to have sex and have abortions when it's a eugenics center, just wall-to-wall evil, frothing government everywhere, arresting people for no reason everywhere, two-tiered justice system,
[01:16:04.878 --> 01:16:13.091]  CPS grabbing children coast-to-coast, publicly caught flying them out to Saudi Arabia, footnote in the newspaper, I mean evil so wicked!
[01:16:15.834 --> 01:16:18.575]  I can't believe... I mean, all I want to do is reach people.
[01:16:18.675 --> 01:16:20.436]  I literally got a headache last night.
[01:16:20.496 --> 01:16:21.697]  I literally cried last night.
[01:16:21.777 --> 01:16:22.837]  I just want to reach people.
[01:16:23.317 --> 01:16:24.418]  I don't know what I've got to do.
[01:16:24.518 --> 01:16:32.301]  I don't know what I've got to say to you, the listeners, to go to PrisonPlanet.com right now, to the News and Focus section on the right-hand side, and to get the article about U.S.
[01:16:32.361 --> 01:16:35.543]  Army Pushes for Amnesty Bill, Fast Track So It Can Recruit Illegal Aliens.
[01:16:36.083 --> 01:16:37.364]  And it gets into the high treason.
[01:16:37.784 --> 01:16:40.965]  I don't know how a hundred of you aren't writing your own articles for your own websites.
[01:16:41.426 --> 01:16:42.206]  I don't understand
[01:16:43.251 --> 01:16:52.775]  How all I've tried to do is network with this Patriot Movement and 9-11 Movement and have all these people on my show and then all they do is not link to us and bad-mouth us behind our backs.
[01:16:53.455 --> 01:16:56.176]  I could care less about being some high-profile person.
[01:16:56.696 --> 01:16:57.997]  What I've done is dangerous.
[01:16:58.337 --> 01:16:59.377]  I know what's going on.
[01:16:59.437 --> 01:17:00.958]  I've got my head screwed on straight.
[01:17:01.198 --> 01:17:03.158]  And that's why we're the leaders in this movement.
[01:17:03.539 --> 01:17:08.160]  And that's why so many other people who are in this movement for the wrong reasons don't realize what they're involved in.
[01:17:08.981 --> 01:17:09.921]  Let me tell you something.
[01:17:10.661 --> 01:17:12.382]  Folks, this is life and death right now.
[01:17:13.507 --> 01:17:17.529]  And when I tell you a story is important and it needs to be put to the fore winds, I mean it.
[01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:20.911]  Now I want you to go to PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:17:21.832 --> 01:17:25.534]  And I want you to get this article and I want you to write up everything I've said.
[01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:26.455]  Make a transcript of it.
[01:17:26.515 --> 01:17:27.055]  Help me!
[01:17:27.916 --> 01:17:29.316]  All I want to do is reach people.
[01:17:30.577 --> 01:17:31.838]  Our government is criminal.
[01:17:31.878 --> 01:17:32.838]  It's not our government.
[01:17:33.459 --> 01:17:35.140]  The military is totally bankrupt.
[01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:40.263]  And I've been researching the head of NORTHCOM, the head of CENTCOM, the head of all of them.
[01:17:40.743 --> 01:17:42.024]  And I mean, these are evil men.
[01:17:44.617 --> 01:17:46.077]  These are very wicked people.
[01:17:46.158 --> 01:17:47.418]  They hate America.
[01:17:47.438 --> 01:17:49.419]  Do you understand, folks?
[01:17:49.919 --> 01:17:56.061]  Hitler was evil, but at least he was misguided in what he thought he was doing for Germany.
[01:17:56.081 --> 01:18:00.082]  He was very wicked, but he at least, from what I've read, really believed in his country.
[01:18:01.322 --> 01:18:02.863]  These people are worse than Hitler.
[01:18:03.323 --> 01:18:05.083]  They actually hate America.
[01:18:05.684 --> 01:18:10.645]  And then they got the nerve to wrap themselves in the flag and talk about how they love it.
[01:18:11.045 --> 01:18:13.486]  These people are sicko filth.
[01:18:15.115 --> 01:18:20.497]  Al Gore, Rudolph Giuliani, George Bush, Hillary Clinton, they're just puppets.
[01:18:21.157 --> 01:18:26.719]  And David Rockefeller, who runs the North American continent, openly wrote in his book that he's here to destroy America.
[01:18:26.759 --> 01:18:29.720]  Go read it for yourself, that son of a... that piece of filth.
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:36.042]  And I'm just so sick of you and your American flags and your support the drift garbage all over your car.
[01:18:36.282 --> 01:18:43.204]  You're a bunch of well-meaning yuppies, but you have no idea who you're working for, you have no idea who you're involved with, you idiots!
[01:18:44.324 --> 01:18:46.105]  What is it you don't understand about treason?
[01:18:46.565 --> 01:18:51.608]  Our military is working to destroy our borders and turn our military into foreign troops.
[01:18:51.868 --> 01:18:52.748]  That's treason!
[01:18:53.769 --> 01:18:56.490]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?

[01:19:46.775 --> 01:19:47.495]  Do it today!
[01:19:53.238 --> 01:19:54.219]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:19:54.299 --> 01:19:59.081]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:19:59.241 --> 01:20:07.045]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:20:07.325 --> 01:20:12.687]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:20:12.888 --> 01:20:19.871]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:20:20.171 --> 01:20:25.515]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:20:25.755 --> 01:20:30.498]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:20:30.839 --> 01:20:38.424]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:20:38.764 --> 01:20:39.385]  We're good to go!
[01:20:52.941 --> 01:20:56.505]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:20:56.545 --> 01:20:57.065]  are located?
[01:20:57.265 --> 01:21:00.669]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:05.595]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:21:05.875 --> 01:21:10.881]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[01:21:11.121 --> 01:21:11.701]  We're good to go.
[01:21:31.271 --> 01:21:31.611]  I think so.
[01:21:52.384 --> 01:21:56.669]  If you've ever wanted to grow the absolute best tasting fruits and vegetables imaginable, here's some exciting news.
[01:21:56.869 --> 01:21:59.553]  There's a new product designed to make growing delicious produce easy.
[01:21:59.753 --> 01:22:02.156]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's dynamite in the garden.
[01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:09.104]  Proto-Gro is a bioactive superfood for plants that works by providing true broad spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their full genetic expression.
[01:22:09.404 --> 01:22:10.524]  What does this mean in the garden?
[01:22:10.584 --> 01:22:21.887]  It means mouth-watering fruits and vegetables, brilliantly colored flowers, herbs that finally grow to medicinal strength, blue-ribbon garden produce jam-packed with bioavailable minerals and trace elements, giant pumpkins, even high-potency hybrid sweetgrass.
[01:22:21.987 --> 01:22:25.027]  Proto-Gro is a proprietary blend of full-spectrum nutrients from the sea.
[01:22:25.167 --> 01:22:27.748]  It literally contains the basic building blocks of life itself.
[01:22:27.968 --> 01:22:34.969]  In fact, Proto-Gro is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record time that it almost forces plants to grow even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[01:22:35.269 --> 01:22:37.890]  It's also perfect for growing your own survival foods and mice.
[01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:39.932]  Just be the ultimate hard times barter item.
[01:22:40.052 --> 01:22:43.816]  To grow tastier fruits and vegetables right now, go to growlikecrazy.com.
[01:22:44.036 --> 01:22:46.038]  That's growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:22:46.058 --> 01:22:46.098]  877-327-0365.
[01:23:09.648 --> 01:23:12.050]  We got Randy Weaver coming up in the next hour.
[01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:18.954]  He's talking about going up to be there with the Browns in New Hampshire.
[01:23:19.734 --> 01:23:20.995]  Right now, Raymond Schwab.
[01:23:22.796 --> 01:23:25.298]  Remember a few months ago, I had him and his friend on.
[01:23:25.338 --> 01:23:31.561]  They're two pastors, lay pastors, who were walking across the country from Colorado to, I guess, D.C.
[01:23:31.621 --> 01:23:39.126]  for 9-11 Truth, and literally every mile or two got stopped by police telling them cameras are illegal, signs against the war illegal, freedom's illegal.
[01:23:40.992 --> 01:23:47.995]  And then they went back to a wedding in Kansas and he had a stepson taken, you know, it's his wife's son from a previous marriage.
[01:23:48.496 --> 01:23:59.421]  And they said because he was out doing 9-11 Truth and during the summer they were, every few days she'd drive out and meet with him in an RV, which sounds like a great experience for a seven-year-old.
[01:23:59.641 --> 01:24:06.065]  But now it's been handed over, the child's been handed over to a grandmother, but the CPS is trying to make a move to Kansas.
[01:24:06.730 --> 01:24:10.633]  And the CPS is busy trying to now take the child even probably away from the grandmother.
[01:24:11.174 --> 01:24:14.516]  So this is just how these wicked creatures... But don't worry, you're an illegal alien, man.
[01:24:14.917 --> 01:24:16.198]  You can be an aggravated felon.
[01:24:16.698 --> 01:24:17.939]  I mean, that means child rapist.
[01:24:17.959 --> 01:24:18.740]  That's in the bill.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.561]  I can't believe it myself.
[01:24:20.902 --> 01:24:21.642]  You're A-OK.
[01:24:22.643 --> 01:24:23.944]  But you videotape cops.
[01:24:23.964 --> 01:24:24.464]  You're going to jail.
[01:24:24.484 --> 01:24:25.325]  They're going to take your kids.
[01:24:26.346 --> 01:24:27.807]  That's because we're the dumb Americans.
[01:24:27.847 --> 01:24:29.609]  We're here to be raped because we're a bunch of idiots.
[01:24:30.509 --> 01:24:32.311]  Raymond Schwab, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:24:33.493 --> 01:24:34.534]  Thanks for having me Alex.
[01:24:34.695 --> 01:24:37.738]  Sounds like there's a lot going on right now.
[01:24:38.058 --> 01:24:44.245]  I wanted to mention something about what you were talking about just to add my own two cents about what's happening in this country.
[01:24:44.265 --> 01:24:52.955]  I got a call from someone the other day that lives in the Missouri area to have family that's in law enforcement and they said that
[01:24:54.403 --> 01:25:19.592]  A while back, Homeland Security was training these deputies in riot control and crowd control, and his sister, being a fan of yours, listening, asked the Homeland Security guy why they were receiving all this intensive training, and he told her, you know, and this is all from this guy's sister, but apparently they told her that he couldn't tell her everything
[01:25:20.214 --> 01:25:24.675]  That he knew, but by 2010, this country was not going to be the same America.
[01:25:25.776 --> 01:25:29.177]  And, uh, it scared her so bad she went and got baptized.
[01:25:29.657 --> 01:25:32.257]  But, uh, you know, they're... Yeah, that's right.
[01:25:32.297 --> 01:25:33.678]  People better get concerned.
[01:25:33.698 --> 01:25:38.959]  Let me tell you, they're going to hand it all over to Latin Americans and it's going to be a giant third world cesspit.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:41.260]  And it's just sad.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:48.142]  A lot of people know what's going on and, you know, I've never been afraid of having my children taken because I know I'm a good father, but, uh,
[01:25:48.672 --> 01:25:56.879]  This new challenge that we have with this block in our ministry really has opened my eyes that this is across the board.
[01:25:56.899 --> 01:26:00.562]  The corruption, you can't find justice anywhere.
[01:26:01.142 --> 01:26:04.205]  You know, we had an emergency hearing with this situation.
[01:26:04.265 --> 01:26:06.747]  The judge sat up there and sighed and mocked.
[01:26:06.827 --> 01:26:10.189]  My wife told her she didn't have any sense in her head.
[01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:15.594]  I mean, you're talking a mother that just got her child taken away and he's sitting up there, you know, in his
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.281]  Stately robes mocking my wife.
[01:26:18.301 --> 01:26:18.582]  No, no, no.
[01:26:18.602 --> 01:26:19.542]  They enjoy it.
[01:26:19.562 --> 01:26:20.643]  See, that's the thing when you go.
[01:26:21.244 --> 01:26:26.528]  I've seen judges actually show their teeth and cackle like witches out of Hollywood movies, sir.
[01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:29.010]  I don't think you've seen the evil we witness.
[01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:34.354]  I mean, you've had your child grabbed, which is hell on earth, but I've seen stuff that's just unbelievable.
[01:26:35.234 --> 01:26:36.716]  I believe it, Alex.
[01:26:36.816 --> 01:26:38.357]  And so far, you know, God has been
[01:26:38.934 --> 01:26:45.256]  Gracious, we do have our son in a safe place, but they've subjected us to psychological testing.
[01:26:45.436 --> 01:26:49.417]  They've forced us to make decisions as parents that we weren't making before.
[01:26:49.797 --> 01:26:57.040]  No one has deemed my child a child in need of care or none of the allegations have been substantiated.
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:03.002]  As a matter of fact, we provided enough paperwork and other testimony.
[01:27:03.282 --> 01:27:07.303]  This is the third time we've had them show up since we've been doing this.
[01:27:07.941 --> 01:27:10.443]  The other two times... Now tell folks how it started.
[01:27:10.463 --> 01:27:15.207]  You go to a wedding, police surround it like Al-Qaeda's inside, and tell folks what happened.
[01:27:15.987 --> 01:27:16.288]  Sure.
[01:27:16.408 --> 01:27:24.234]  We went... Actually, before we went back to the wedding, two weeks before we went back to the wedding, police showed up at our RV with a social worker.
[01:27:25.117 --> 01:27:34.201]  Wanted to pull my kids aside and interrogate them, look at my RV, search everything, talk to us, and fortunately... Again, because, I mean, the cops, we're helping America.
[01:27:35.041 --> 01:27:38.803]  Al-Qaeda's attacking us, and these crazy people think 9-11's an inside job.
[01:27:38.843 --> 01:27:39.983]  We'll just take their kids.
[01:27:40.043 --> 01:27:41.024]  We're the good guys.
[01:27:42.144 --> 01:27:46.926]  Sure, and, you know, they just... Right then they said, we don't believe the allegations are unfounded.
[01:27:47.006 --> 01:27:51.168]  Big RV, it's summertime, you guys are homeschooling your kids, it's all good.
[01:27:52.113 --> 01:27:53.374]  So we think everything's fine.
[01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:54.314]  We get to Missouri.
[01:27:54.354 --> 01:27:55.135]  We have to backtrack.
[01:27:55.155 --> 01:27:55.855]  It's terrible!
[01:27:55.915 --> 01:27:57.576]  They were just laying the trap, you know.
[01:27:58.617 --> 01:28:00.238]  Yeah, it was pretty interesting.
[01:28:00.278 --> 01:28:03.480]  My wife... Remember, whatever they say, whatever they say, it's the opposite.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:06.141]  I'm starting to see that.
[01:28:06.321 --> 01:28:06.622]  No, no.
[01:28:06.662 --> 01:28:07.302]  Believe me, sir.
[01:28:07.322 --> 01:28:08.383]  They are pure demons.
[01:28:09.984 --> 01:28:10.504]  Okay.
[01:28:11.304 --> 01:28:12.465]  We go back for the wedding.
[01:28:12.505 --> 01:28:13.506]  My wife's the maid of honor.
[01:28:13.566 --> 01:28:15.767]  I bring the children because I'm watching the children.
[01:28:16.537 --> 01:28:20.239]  Fifteen minutes before the wedding, my wife comes down, she's looking beautiful, gives me a kiss.
[01:28:21.279 --> 01:28:25.181]  Police officer comes up, says, you know, you're Mr. Schwab, will you come over here and talk to me?
[01:28:26.161 --> 01:28:29.243]  I'm thinking, man, this Homeland Security or something, because of what we're doing.
[01:28:29.803 --> 01:28:34.065]  All of a sudden, three other plainclothes officers surround me and my wife and say, we're taking your son.
[01:28:34.745 --> 01:28:41.648]  And, you know, pretty much devastated the wedding, the bride comes... And of course, they were counting on you to resist, and they'd have blown you away right there.
[01:28:44.142 --> 01:28:47.148]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:50.754]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.911 --> 01:28:56.612]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[01:28:57.073 --> 01:28:59.354]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[01:28:59.654 --> 01:29:02.735]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[01:29:03.215 --> 01:29:05.356]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[01:29:05.537 --> 01:29:06.937]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[01:29:07.197 --> 01:29:11.299]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[01:29:11.639 --> 01:29:14.761]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[01:29:15.061 --> 01:29:17.142]  With more than 500 vital functions.
[01:29:17.522 --> 01:29:19.283]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs.
[01:29:19.623 --> 01:29:19.863]  I think so.
[01:29:36.876 --> 01:29:42.443]  To order LIV52 and for the best source of researched herbal products, visit research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482.
[01:29:42.463 --> 01:29:44.746]  That's research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:29:54.614 --> 01:29:58.397]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[01:29:58.777 --> 01:30:06.023]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[01:30:06.043 --> 01:30:11.487]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts,
[01:30:11.887 --> 01:30:17.494]  Now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[01:30:17.554 --> 01:30:18.014]  Central.
[01:30:18.375 --> 01:30:24.001]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated but never duplicated.
[01:30:24.322 --> 01:30:30.189]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[01:30:30.689 --> 01:30:35.430]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:40.611]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[01:30:41.051 --> 01:30:42.352]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[01:30:42.412 --> 01:30:42.832]  Central.
[01:30:43.412 --> 01:30:50.834]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetsmen.org.
[01:30:53.499 --> 01:30:57.540]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:01.142]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:04.843]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:31:05.063 --> 01:31:08.324]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:31:08.344 --> 01:31:13.806]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:31:13.846 --> 01:31:19.048]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal form it's like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[01:31:19.548 --> 01:31:23.469]  Well, going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:31:23.589 --> 01:31:24.970]  It's a well thought out formula.
[01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:30.432]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:31:30.872 --> 01:31:35.333]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:31:35.394 --> 01:31:36.674]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:31:36.934 --> 01:31:40.820]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[01:31:54.022 --> 01:32:08.911]  Way up north, to Alaska Way up north, to Alaska North to Alaska, go north for the rest of your song North to Alaska, go north for the rest of your song
[01:32:15.957 --> 01:32:20.843]  The military is publicly training for martial law and to put American citizens in FEMA camps.
[01:32:20.903 --> 01:32:26.369]  It's not a rumor anymore or video I shot at some urban warrior training drill in Oakland, California.
[01:32:27.290 --> 01:32:29.592]  It's the John Warren Defense Authorization Act.
[01:32:29.712 --> 01:32:30.233]  It's everything.
[01:32:30.891 --> 01:32:42.634]  And if they think they can get away with it, like Tommy Frank said, and Cigar Aficionado, it's real sad, but the American people want martial law and after the next attack we're going to have a military government.
[01:32:43.275 --> 01:32:46.075]  Generals just hate military governments.
[01:32:46.576 --> 01:32:51.317]  And we really hate it through history taking over and ruining things.
[01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:54.931]  I mean, this is so sick, folks.
[01:32:55.011 --> 01:32:56.312]  They're doing it to America.
[01:32:56.372 --> 01:32:59.173]  And don't worry, there will always be American flags wrapped around it.
[01:32:59.673 --> 01:33:04.275]  So you can still bow down and worship your American flag, but nothing will be left on the inside of the country.
[01:33:06.437 --> 01:33:08.017]  The military is guilty of high treason.
[01:33:08.037 --> 01:33:09.158]  We're going to finish up with Mr. Schwab.
[01:33:09.178 --> 01:33:11.139]  I'm going to get back into this and take some calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:11.199 --> 01:33:12.600]  I put the call out in the first hour.
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:14.160]  I told you folks, this is a big news item.
[01:33:18.746 --> 01:33:20.226]  I need you to call everybody you know.
[01:33:20.646 --> 01:33:25.007]  Don't just give in to this stuff and say they're trying to pass the amnesty bill again today.
[01:33:25.408 --> 01:33:38.430]  Bush is confident it's going to pass, and the Pentagon and defense contractors are criminally lobbying against the Constitution, the sovereignty of the country, the Bill of Rights, and giving money to the Senators to sell the country out.
[01:33:38.851 --> 01:33:40.491]  It is an America ending.
[01:33:40.731 --> 01:33:45.292]  Something Hitler, something Stalin, something Mao couldn't do, something the Redcoats couldn't do,
[01:33:46.338 --> 01:33:49.300]  Our own stinking military can do, because it's not our military.
[01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:52.063]  They are, and I'm not talking about the poor grunts, folks.
[01:33:52.163 --> 01:33:55.805]  I mean the scumbag CFR New World Order leaders.
[01:33:56.486 --> 01:34:08.215]  Before we go back to our guest, we need to be healthy to fight the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen, and Interfood is the way to go at interfood.com, E-N-E-R, food.com, or 866-762-9238.
[01:34:08.555 --> 01:34:09.816]  It's the best green food out there.
[01:34:09.956 --> 01:34:10.477]  I use it.
[01:34:11.037 --> 01:34:11.818]  My wife uses it.
[01:34:11.878 --> 01:34:13.259]  It's awesome, and they're patriots.
[01:34:14.111 --> 01:34:18.453]  Bad nutrition is a breeding ground for illness due to stress and anxiety, not to mention chemtrails.
[01:34:18.873 --> 01:34:21.174]  Ask yourself, what is your diet like?
[01:34:21.554 --> 01:34:26.116]  Processed foods and even good organics don't have the nutritional values that you need in today's world.
[01:34:26.376 --> 01:34:26.876]  Think about it.
[01:34:26.916 --> 01:34:31.278]  Have you forgotten that you're supposed to feel good and energetic all day long and if not,
[01:34:31.898 --> 01:34:33.619]  You aren't getting the nutrition you need.
[01:34:33.959 --> 01:34:58.656]  Stop wishing you had more energy and focus and make it happen today with one simple phone call to 866-762-9238 or visit them on the web at www.innerfood.com that's www.innerfood.com or 866-762-9232 ladies and gentlemen and then also as times get rough and I told you I'm going down with the ship I'm gonna stay here in the United States
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:02.542]  And I'm going to fight as they try to bring us down.
[01:35:02.622 --> 01:35:03.503]  This is a world government.
[01:35:03.523 --> 01:35:04.503]  There's really nowhere to run.
[01:35:04.523 --> 01:35:07.025]  I think we're going to win.
[01:35:07.065 --> 01:35:07.846]  This isn't Germany.
[01:35:07.866 --> 01:35:08.886]  This isn't Russia.
[01:35:08.906 --> 01:35:09.947]  They're not going to get away with it.
[01:35:12.109 --> 01:35:14.090]  You need to get storable foods, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:15.091 --> 01:35:16.572]  My friends, you need to listen very carefully.
[01:35:16.952 --> 01:35:20.255]  We have to store food for our families if we're going to stay free and stay alive.
[01:35:21.035 --> 01:35:21.776]  Look at Katrina.
[01:35:21.796 --> 01:35:25.979]  The high and dry areas, they came in and said, no power, no food until you hand over your guns.
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:29.021]  You've got to have food.
[01:35:31.747 --> 01:35:37.170]  And it goes on, the prime rule of power is that you control nations with oil and people with food.
[01:35:38.131 --> 01:35:44.614]  And ladies and gentlemen, that's exactly what's happening, and the UN Food Program has said they plan to use food as a weapon in this country.
[01:35:45.215 --> 01:35:52.218]  If countries with ethnic cleansing, they euthanize the elders and kill the young preferably before they're born, and starve everyone else in between.
[01:35:52.659 --> 01:35:56.241]  Bullets and the manpower to pull the triggers are too expensive and time-consuming.
[01:35:56.561 --> 01:36:00.303]  Starvation has always been the preferred method of eliminating undesirables.
[01:36:01.087 --> 01:36:06.232]  I want you to call eFoodsDirect, ladies and gentlemen, at eFoodsDirect.com or 1-800-409-5633.
[01:36:06.792 --> 01:36:11.116]  Steve Schenck is the name, the oldest continual company.
[01:36:11.536 --> 01:36:13.939]  I have a year's supply with them and it's of the highest quality.
[01:36:14.239 --> 01:36:16.561]  You're insane if you don't call and get a year's supply of food.
[01:36:17.293 --> 01:36:18.654]  Don't do the stupid vacation.
[01:36:18.694 --> 01:36:20.394]  Don't do the breast implants.
[01:36:20.874 --> 01:36:22.515]  Get food for your family, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:22.935 --> 01:36:25.396]  You don't need the big truck with the big tires to act manly.
[01:36:25.636 --> 01:36:26.897]  A man takes care of his family.
[01:36:26.917 --> 01:36:33.419]  1-800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com Give a call today.
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:37.901]  And let's go ahead and go back to Raymond Schwab.
[01:36:38.021 --> 01:36:38.341]  Raymond?
[01:36:39.193 --> 01:36:40.754]  So, they surround you.
[01:36:40.774 --> 01:36:42.255]  How are they behaving?
[01:36:42.295 --> 01:36:49.920]  What was it like to see your son, your wife's genetic son, your stepson, because obviously he's your son spiritually completely.
[01:36:50.921 --> 01:36:55.183]  What was it like to see your wife's son taken away?
[01:36:55.223 --> 01:36:55.644]  What happened?
[01:36:55.664 --> 01:36:56.624]  What did he do?
[01:36:57.425 --> 01:37:00.747]  Describe what it's like for the child, the trauma-based mind control.
[01:37:01.658 --> 01:37:03.160]  And it's still horrifying for him.
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.281]  He called me the other day.
[01:37:04.321 --> 01:37:12.748]  They were forcing him to visit with a family member he hadn't seen in years, a person that kidnapped him many years ago, drug user.
[01:37:12.909 --> 01:37:17.873]  I mean, a bad, bad person calls me up telling me, Dad, you know, come and get me.
[01:37:18.393 --> 01:37:19.835]  And it's a feeling of powerlessness.
[01:37:19.955 --> 01:37:20.555]  You know what I mean?
[01:37:20.776 --> 01:37:21.897]  You want to fight.
[01:37:22.777 --> 01:37:25.460]  You want to take it on in a different manner than we have so far.
[01:37:26.313 --> 01:37:30.238]  Because I feel like I'm going to take my time.
[01:37:30.439 --> 01:37:32.381]  God is going to have his way with these people.
[01:37:33.943 --> 01:37:39.049]  Statistically, there are more drug abuse, more heart attacks, more family violence, more of them go to prison.
[01:37:39.069 --> 01:37:43.395]  These CPS workers wonder why their kids die in car accidents.
[01:37:44.455 --> 01:37:44.976]  It's God.
[01:37:45.096 --> 01:37:46.716]  I mean, I'm not trying to be mean here, folks.
[01:37:46.776 --> 01:37:47.917]  I mean, you're cursing yourselves.
[01:37:48.877 --> 01:37:51.338]  Listen, people say fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.
[01:37:51.638 --> 01:37:54.419]  You ignorant worldly people think nothing's ever going to catch up with you.
[01:37:54.439 --> 01:37:56.580]  In fact, get Johnny Cash going to cut you down already.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:57.160]  I want to play it.
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.841]  I want you to know, folks, I've experienced it.
[01:37:59.901 --> 01:38:01.762]  I've had experiences I won't even talk about on air.
[01:38:02.042 --> 01:38:03.343]  There is a spiritual realm.
[01:38:03.443 --> 01:38:04.083]  It is real.
[01:38:04.343 --> 01:38:08.985]  And I'm telling you, folks, I'm telling you, when you do evil, it comes back on you sevenfold.
[01:38:09.245 --> 01:38:11.626]  And I don't know how any of you could wantonly hurt people.
[01:38:12.166 --> 01:38:13.227]  I am scared of God.
[01:38:13.247 --> 01:38:17.530]  I love God, but I know God is just God and will punish me if I'm evil.
[01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:19.431]  Do you have any comments on that, Pastor?
[01:38:20.952 --> 01:38:26.737]  I agree, Brother, and I know that God is going to fight this battle for us, and that's why we continue to walk in.
[01:38:27.377 --> 01:38:29.939]  We have to go back to 28th for a court hearing, you know.
[01:38:31.050 --> 01:38:43.038]  Each time I've been facing these people with the fact that what they're doing is not only unjust, it's wrong, that they're answerable to a higher order, and they kind of laugh and scorn, but I see it in their eyes.
[01:38:43.078 --> 01:38:43.719]  There's some fear.
[01:38:44.201 --> 01:38:47.803]  In their eyes that they know, you know, they told me the other day, well, we got a court injunction.
[01:38:47.843 --> 01:38:48.964]  I told them, I don't care.
[01:38:49.384 --> 01:38:51.105]  It's an unlawful court injunction.
[01:38:51.145 --> 01:38:58.170]  You guys know this is all based on perjury and lies, yet you're still abusing my family and subjecting my child.
[01:38:58.190 --> 01:39:05.034]  You know, they ripped my child screaming from his mother's arms saying that if she don't relinquish him, uh, you know, they're going to bring in armed.
[01:39:05.254 --> 01:39:09.116]  They had, you know, their foot soldiers outside waiting to storm the wedding.
[01:39:09.697 --> 01:39:09.777]  Um,
[01:39:10.988 --> 01:39:20.114]  All on false allegations, you know, the bride comes down a mess, she's 15 minutes from the most joyous time of her life, it's her nephew, she's crying, why are you breaking up my wedding?
[01:39:20.615 --> 01:39:26.199]  You know, and, you know, they were apologetic, we're sorry, we're sorry, but it's a fact they were too cowardly.
[01:39:26.219 --> 01:39:29.101]  We're sorry, we're sorry, but we've got to load you on these trains.
[01:39:29.841 --> 01:39:33.944]  Sure, absolutely, and it was a travesty, and it was sickening.
[01:39:35.029 --> 01:39:35.970]  It was the grace of God.
[01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:46.435]  You know, my wife looked me right in my face and she said, they're not taking my son and she grabbed him and she was going to do something crazy and I just started praying with her and told her, you know, we got to trust in God.
[01:39:46.475 --> 01:39:47.155]  We're going to get through this.
[01:39:47.175 --> 01:39:49.497]  Now what happened is, thank God, they had the child.
[01:39:49.517 --> 01:39:53.399]  They usually do things where they don't feed them to try to get them to say bad things about the parents.
[01:39:53.519 --> 01:39:58.121]  They were unable to do that because your child was old enough to not be confused into saying something that wasn't true.
[01:39:58.221 --> 01:40:03.244]  Seven, now a grandmother has a child but CPS is even coming around now trying to do something there.
[01:40:04.457 --> 01:40:08.358]  Yeah, I mean, they're going over there wanting to sit and observe my wife and the child.
[01:40:08.378 --> 01:40:12.139]  They've run us through psychological testing that I've been refusing to tell them they are correct.
[01:40:12.179 --> 01:40:15.460]  Which is their people, which worked for them to set you up.
[01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:17.300]  You go bear false witness against yourself.
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:18.921]  You go violate your own Fifth Amendment.
[01:40:18.941 --> 01:40:19.861]  It's not even real courts.
[01:40:20.241 --> 01:40:22.582]  Tell us where this happened, where the scum is located.
[01:40:22.942 --> 01:40:23.822]  Tell us their names.
[01:40:23.882 --> 01:40:24.742]  Tell us the phone numbers.
[01:40:25.802 --> 01:40:27.443]  It's in Riley County, Kansas.
[01:40:28.883 --> 01:40:29.623]  The phone number is 785-537-7000.
[01:40:32.728 --> 01:40:43.597]  6364 is the courthouse, and the company that's doing this is a subcontracted private corporation working for the state, another outsourced tyranny.
[01:40:44.218 --> 01:40:45.539]  They're called the KVC.
[01:40:45.919 --> 01:40:48.261]  Well they do that because then it's a revolving door.
[01:40:48.521 --> 01:40:50.763]  The politicians get to fund their buddies that way.
[01:40:51.584 --> 01:40:55.707]  Well it also tries to keep them from liability in their corruption.
[01:40:56.309 --> 01:40:59.631]  And so they can pass the buck, and that's what they've been doing, is passing the buck.
[01:40:59.911 --> 01:41:04.675]  Every time we try to get something done, it's, you gotta call these people, and those people say, you gotta call these people.
[01:41:04.695 --> 01:41:06.796]  You know, we're fighting 28th.
[01:41:07.036 --> 01:41:13.220]  If they deem my child that has been neglected, I have to stay in Kansas, indefinitely, and fight this.
[01:41:13.921 --> 01:41:17.023]  When I'm not even a resident of the state, they pretty much just said, quit your job.
[01:41:17.663 --> 01:41:21.646]  They told me I was irresponsible to continue on our walk, even though we put
[01:41:22.355 --> 01:41:25.637]  I sold my business to do this because I believe we're losing this country.
[01:41:25.677 --> 01:41:28.259]  I believe the church is at the forefront of this deception.
[01:41:28.279 --> 01:41:44.229]  That's why we're walking across the country trying to wake up people in the church, trying to tell them what they're doing is wrong, to stop supporting the New World Order, to stop puppeting and parodying Fox News and that Bush is a good Christian man and, you know, they pretty much just said, we don't care what you're doing.
[01:41:44.249 --> 01:41:46.250]  If you keep walking, it's going to show you don't love your son.
[01:41:46.290 --> 01:41:47.771]  Quit everything you're doing and come back here.
[01:41:47.791 --> 01:41:50.233]  And I'm like, you people are not going to destroy our lives.
[01:41:50.731 --> 01:41:51.671]  We're not going to allow this to happen.
[01:41:51.691 --> 01:41:52.632]  But they always lie.
[01:41:52.912 --> 01:41:54.112]  They always lie, too.
[01:41:54.132 --> 01:41:57.573]  Oh, and they've been lying to my wife non-stop.
[01:41:57.613 --> 01:41:59.114]  But they're called the KVC.
[01:41:59.154 --> 01:42:02.595]  Their number is 785-537-9144.
[01:42:03.015 --> 01:42:04.615]  Case manager, her name is Suzanne.
[01:42:05.916 --> 01:42:13.258]  And, you know, we're just praying that people... And by the way, their textbooks at colleges call the family a disease.
[01:42:15.331 --> 01:42:20.893]  But these caseworkers are five times more likely than any other group in the population to be abusers of children.
[01:42:21.513 --> 01:42:24.314]  And so it's just, this is the new America.
[01:42:25.534 --> 01:42:27.715]  But we're dangerous because we homeschool our children.
[01:42:27.835 --> 01:42:29.656]  You know, we control our children's education.
[01:42:29.696 --> 01:42:31.856]  Don't let the state brainwash them in the schools.
[01:42:31.956 --> 01:42:33.617]  We are dangerous because
[01:42:34.042 --> 01:42:37.445]  You know, they won't look at any of our information, but they'll sit and scoff and frown.
[01:42:37.765 --> 01:42:39.427]  But, you know, I do want to say one thing.
[01:42:39.527 --> 01:42:41.128]  It's not only these people.
[01:42:41.488 --> 01:42:50.836]  It's the people in this country that we meet every day that don't listen, that just walk and drive by with their heads in the air, thinking we're a bunch of kooks that won't look at the evidence.
[01:42:51.217 --> 01:42:52.698]  The people in the churches that
[01:42:53.371 --> 01:42:56.614]  want to be blind, they're building this police state.
[01:42:56.754 --> 01:43:05.502]  The people that have called the police on us to help contribute to this process because they think it's unhealthy, we homeschool our children, they're building the scaffolding that's going to hang them.
[01:43:05.942 --> 01:43:08.604]  They're helping the New World Order do what they're doing.
[01:43:08.845 --> 01:43:10.626]  And, you know, it's a shame on them.
[01:43:11.026 --> 01:43:16.131]  And I just hope more and more people start waking up and fighting this.
[01:43:16.211 --> 01:43:17.272]  It's across the board.
[01:43:17.901 --> 01:43:22.803]  Whether they're going after our children or our liberties or the fact that we get harassed every time we pull out a camera.
[01:43:22.823 --> 01:43:26.785]  These cops look like they're going to have a heart attack because they're filming us.
[01:43:27.386 --> 01:43:28.286]  And we just had another one.
[01:43:28.306 --> 01:43:30.687]  They're filming us and saying, OK, fine, I'm filming you too.
[01:43:30.707 --> 01:43:32.548]  And we're like, OK, why are you getting all mad?
[01:43:32.828 --> 01:43:33.468]  You're filming us.
[01:43:33.508 --> 01:43:34.289]  We're filming you.
[01:43:34.849 --> 01:43:35.549]  What's the problem?
[01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:36.230]  You know what I mean?
[01:43:36.970 --> 01:43:37.610]  They just hate it.
[01:43:37.871 --> 01:43:40.872]  Now they arrest people ghost to ghost and say it's illegal to film them.
[01:43:41.610 --> 01:43:47.694]  Well, you may be getting a phone call before we're finished that one of us is in jail for... I don't know, we're not going to stop, Alex.
[01:43:47.754 --> 01:43:57.899]  But the illegal aliens, it's in the bill Bush is trying to pass right now, child molesters, aggravated child molesters, people who've never paid taxes, it's all forgiven.
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:01.221]  But you, they're going to take your child.
[01:44:02.202 --> 01:44:09.186]  Sure, people that are peace-loving, we declare we're peace-loving people that preach the gospel, that
[01:44:09.827 --> 01:44:11.748]  We are just trying to bring truth and light.
[01:44:11.808 --> 01:44:13.248]  We're moral people.
[01:44:13.408 --> 01:44:15.589]  You know, we don't do drugs.
[01:44:15.609 --> 01:44:16.849]  But that's who they go after.
[01:44:16.929 --> 01:44:17.970]  That's who they go after.
[01:44:19.210 --> 01:44:21.151]  I'm telling you, they know we're the enemy.
[01:44:21.211 --> 01:44:24.572]  Listen, give out your website, give out your contact for folks that want to help you.
[01:44:25.372 --> 01:44:28.594]  Sure, our website is www.bateshaloministries.org.
[01:44:28.654 --> 01:44:30.774]  You can get it off www.infowars.com.
[01:44:30.834 --> 01:44:32.055]  I saw the link was up there.
[01:44:32.755 --> 01:44:35.576]  You can Google our Denver to DC walk for truth.
[01:44:36.272 --> 01:44:39.514]  Um, our phone numbers on the website, all our contact information.
[01:44:39.534 --> 01:44:48.398]  We have video on there of all our police contacts and some documentaries that we made as well as an update we just did about what happened with my wife telling her story.
[01:44:48.638 --> 01:44:53.680]  Can you imagine the town where they put the call in to the CPS and ran your place and did some detective work?
[01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:54.840]  I'll show them!
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:56.061]  We'll get that kid!
[01:44:56.081 --> 01:45:00.323]  I mean, can you imagine being that person?
[01:45:01.243 --> 01:45:02.104]  They're not going to get them.
[01:45:02.164 --> 01:45:17.434]  I can't imagine how half these people sleep at night, Alex, and I just pray that the Lord leads some of these people to repentance so that they can start fighting for the truth and stop selling out their country and causing this massive destruction of everything that we hold valuable in America.
[01:45:19.315 --> 01:45:30.503]  Well, you know, yesterday the point was made by Jack McClam that, and I mean literally, scores of Roman and Greek historians and others that were there witnessing it, wrote about it,
[01:45:31.673 --> 01:45:36.036]  From about 100 right through to 300 A.D.
[01:45:36.076 --> 01:45:37.436]  or what they now call Common Era.
[01:45:37.456 --> 01:45:39.257]  They're even getting a Christ's name out of there.
[01:45:40.058 --> 01:45:42.519]  That they'd feed one Christian and a hundred would convert.
[01:45:42.539 --> 01:45:44.481]  They'd feed ten Christians, a thousand would convert.
[01:45:44.941 --> 01:45:47.782]  They'd kill off fifty Christians and ten thousand would convert.
[01:45:48.943 --> 01:45:50.024]  It just isn't going to work.
[01:45:51.244 --> 01:45:52.485]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:45:52.965 --> 01:45:56.688]  There's all these listeners that hate Christians because they judge us by Jerry Falwell and the rest of them.
[01:45:56.708 --> 01:45:57.508]  That's not who we are.
[01:45:58.128 --> 01:46:00.730]  Real Christians helped end slavery in this country.
[01:46:01.943 --> 01:46:04.364]  Real Christians are the light and salt of the world.
[01:46:04.905 --> 01:46:05.925]  And my friend, God bless you.
[01:46:05.965 --> 01:46:06.826]  We're praying for you.
[01:46:06.846 --> 01:46:07.926]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:46:07.946 --> 01:46:10.568]  And I think you're going to end up being blessed in the end by all of this.
[01:46:11.388 --> 01:46:13.870]  And we're just all here with you, my friend.
[01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:18.552]  And just continue to give us updates, call anytime you want, and we appreciate you.
[01:46:19.353 --> 01:46:19.913]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:46:19.973 --> 01:46:30.079]  And we'll keep sending you videos so you can, all our stuff is for use for people, because like you, we want to get it out to everybody, aside from cost, aside from whatever they can, and you seem to
[01:46:30.794 --> 01:46:34.638]  We'll get the information out the best, so hopefully we'll have some more police state stuff for you soon.
[01:46:34.918 --> 01:46:41.585]  Hopefully not actually, I don't know, these guys, they seem to be getting bitterer and more bitterer as we get closer to the East Coast.
[01:46:41.665 --> 01:46:43.127]  That's because you make them feel bad.
[01:46:43.527 --> 01:46:45.569]  Listen, I appreciate you my friend.
[01:46:45.589 --> 01:46:46.250]  We're going to go to break.
[01:46:46.290 --> 01:46:46.871]  God bless you.
[01:46:47.311 --> 01:46:49.293]  Yeah, bitterer and bitterer as you get towards the East Coast.
[01:46:49.313 --> 01:46:50.434]  We'll follow you as you go there.
[01:46:51.495 --> 01:46:53.057]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:46:53.077 --> 01:46:53.958]  This is Raymond Schwab.
[01:46:55.046 --> 01:47:00.250]  His wife's son, her blood son, his stepson taken by CPS because of 9-11.
[01:47:02.172 --> 01:47:03.213]  Here is Johnny Cash.
[01:47:03.233 --> 01:47:04.314]  We'll lead out of the break with this.
[01:47:04.334 --> 01:47:06.696]  We'll come back and get into a bunch of other key news.
[01:47:19.196 --> 01:47:22.277]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:47:22.878 --> 01:47:25.179]  Run on for a long time.
[01:47:25.199 --> 01:47:27.960]  Run on for a long time.
[01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:31.081]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[01:47:31.642 --> 01:47:34.023]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[01:47:36.252 --> 01:47:50.998]  Go tell that long-tongued liar Go and tell that midnight rider Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter Tell him that God's gonna cut him down Tell him that God's gonna cut him down
[01:47:56.111 --> 01:48:21.494]  Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news My head's been wet with the midnight dew I've been down on bended knee Talking to the man from Galilee He spoke to me with a voice so sweet I thought I heard the shuffle of angels sing He called my name and my heart stood still When he said John go do my will Go tell that long tongue liar
[01:48:21.934 --> 01:48:24.535]  Go and tell that midnight rider.
[01:48:25.136 --> 01:48:28.217]  Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter.
[01:48:28.558 --> 01:48:31.179]  Tell him that God's gonna cut him down.
[01:48:31.499 --> 01:48:34.241]  Tell him that God's gonna cut him down.
[01:48:36.302 --> 01:48:38.923]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:48:39.523 --> 01:48:41.845]  Run on for a long time.
[01:48:42.465 --> 01:48:44.626]  Run on for a long time.
[01:48:45.367 --> 01:48:47.788]  Sooner or later, God'll cut you down.
[01:48:48.308 --> 01:48:50.750]  Sooner or later, God'll cut you down.
[01:48:52.894 --> 01:48:58.660]  Well, he may throw you a rock, hide your hand, workin' in the dark against your fellow man.
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:04.445]  But as sure as God made black and white, what's done in the dark will be brought to the light.
[01:49:04.785 --> 01:49:07.348]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:49:08.048 --> 01:49:13.071]  Run on for a long time, run on for a long time.
[01:49:13.791 --> 01:49:19.313]  Sooner or later it's gonna cut you down, sooner or later it's gonna cut you down.
[01:49:21.454 --> 01:49:26.577]  Go tell that long-tongued liar, go and tell that midnight rider,
[01:49:27.197 --> 01:49:33.199]  Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter, tell them that God's gonna cut you down.
[01:49:33.539 --> 01:49:36.220]  Tell them that God's gonna cut you down.
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:41.441]  Tell them that God's gonna cut you down.
[01:49:44.382 --> 01:49:46.182]  Baby, I'm gonna leave you.
[01:49:56.946 --> 01:49:57.407]  It's here!
[01:49:57.607 --> 01:50:02.396]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.757 --> 01:50:10.350]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave the world.
[01:50:11.098 --> 01:50:18.142]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.542 --> 01:50:29.988]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.288 --> 01:50:34.191]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.231 --> 01:50:36.172]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.512 --> 01:50:40.354]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.524 --> 01:51:01.766]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking a hot shower than when you drink the water?
[01:51:02.026 --> 01:51:06.387]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.688 --> 01:51:15.590]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:15.790 --> 01:51:19.411]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[01:51:19.711 --> 01:51:24.756]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:25.037 --> 01:51:31.783]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:32.264 --> 01:51:32.805]  What about you?
[01:51:33.550 --> 01:51:38.452]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.

[01:51:53.453 --> 01:51:55.174]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:55.394 --> 01:51:59.096]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:59.416 --> 01:52:01.617]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:52:02.137 --> 01:52:08.360]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:13.403]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.623 --> 01:52:22.567]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[01:52:22.947 --> 01:52:28.951]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[01:53:15.194 --> 01:53:17.095]  Things have gone bad.
[01:53:17.175 --> 01:53:19.016]  America's gone bad.
[01:53:19.137 --> 01:53:27.962]  And once you start going bad, once a country goes bad, it goes right to the bottom.
[01:53:44.458 --> 01:53:47.501]  Until people finally realize that they've got to stand up.
[01:53:48.442 --> 01:53:59.591]  You realize there's no bottom to this pit until you decide to start reversing the gains that the enemy has made.
[01:54:02.214 --> 01:54:03.575]  High treason has been committed.
[01:54:04.736 --> 01:54:06.597]  High treason has been committed.
[01:54:06.618 --> 01:54:07.738]  The U.S.
[01:54:07.779 --> 01:54:08.179]  military
[01:54:09.441 --> 01:54:16.246]  Is lobbying for the Blanket Amnesty Bill and admitting it's because they want to convert the majority of the military over to foreign, over to illegal aliens.
[01:54:16.486 --> 01:54:17.427]  That's mainstream news.
[01:54:17.527 --> 01:54:18.748]  It's off the charts huge.
[01:54:20.049 --> 01:54:23.472]  Our military working against the will of the people, the Constitution, the sovereignty.
[01:54:23.692 --> 01:54:24.752]  This is not our military.
[01:54:24.792 --> 01:54:26.774]  I don't want to ever hear you call it our military again.
[01:54:27.094 --> 01:54:28.695]  I'm not going to let myself call it military.
[01:54:29.036 --> 01:54:34.800]  It's the military force that was taken over by the New World Order that's now actively attacking America.
[01:54:35.612 --> 01:54:37.233]  Our military is not our military.
[01:54:37.554 --> 01:54:39.495]  The leadership is enemy combatants.
[01:54:39.935 --> 01:54:40.796]  You want to use that term?
[01:54:40.856 --> 01:54:41.236]  I mean it.
[01:54:41.296 --> 01:54:42.657]  They are enemies of America.
[01:54:42.918 --> 01:54:46.841]  They are combatants in the catbird seat trying to destroy things.
[01:54:46.901 --> 01:54:51.164]  Matt Kazee is an independent journalist who has been reporting for Infowars.com.
[01:54:51.724 --> 01:54:53.946]  Finally, he left last night at about 11.30.
[01:54:55.567 --> 01:55:04.873]  Eastern from the Brown property where the police have been stalking and firing at people and then saying nothing's going on with all the APCs and Crips and the media just buys it.
[01:55:04.973 --> 01:55:05.994]  Okay, nothing going on here.
[01:55:06.955 --> 01:55:08.236]  He was able to talk to him today.
[01:55:08.256 --> 01:55:09.376]  We talked to him in the first hour.
[01:55:09.396 --> 01:55:10.297]  He was unable to speak with him.
[01:55:10.577 --> 01:55:11.698]  He's been able to get through to them.
[01:55:12.018 --> 01:55:13.179]  How were you able to get through, Matt?
[01:55:13.939 --> 01:55:16.081]  I've been calling him just non-stop, Alex.
[01:55:16.341 --> 01:55:17.562]  That's on one of their cell phones.
[01:55:17.842 --> 01:55:19.643]  Again, the power in the regular phone's been cut.
[01:55:20.143 --> 01:55:20.844]  Yes, yes.
[01:55:20.944 --> 01:55:22.525]  I finally got through to the cell phone.
[01:55:23.383 --> 01:55:24.584]  I talked to Elaine Brown.
[01:55:24.604 --> 01:55:26.586]  I'm very happy to say that I talked to Elaine Brown.
[01:55:26.606 --> 01:55:28.567]  She's one of the sweetest women of all time.
[01:55:28.627 --> 01:55:29.788]  Sure, but tell us the info.
[01:55:29.808 --> 01:55:30.469]  Tell us the info.
[01:55:30.809 --> 01:55:39.876]  Bottom line, they got a call today from a federal marshal who called the house line and his name is Gary DeMartino.
[01:55:40.936 --> 01:55:41.757]  I've heard that name.
[01:55:42.257 --> 01:55:44.679]  Yes, he told them that they are coming in.
[01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:46.741]  But not tonight.
[01:55:47.461 --> 01:55:48.382]  Not tomorrow night.
[01:55:49.403 --> 01:55:50.904]  And probably not this week.
[01:55:51.494 --> 01:55:57.036]  And they're not coming in to kill him, and he claims that the feds did not shoot at that kid whatsoever.
[01:55:59.257 --> 01:56:01.977]  So he would just... I mean, I know that guy.
[01:56:02.018 --> 01:56:03.978]  He's shaking and freaking out on the phone off-air.
[01:56:04.038 --> 01:56:04.958]  I need to get him on.
[01:56:05.399 --> 01:56:08.120]  Again, he knows some other stuff he wouldn't let me tell you yesterday.
[01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:14.402]  I mean, he's scared to death, and then they did fire at him, and they did taser him, and they did tell him to go lie to the media.
[01:56:14.682 --> 01:56:16.662]  It's admitted now that they tasered him and tackled him.
[01:56:17.062 --> 01:56:17.903]  I mean, they're just such liars.
[01:56:19.298 --> 01:56:19.818]  Absolutely.
[01:56:19.859 --> 01:56:22.480]  Well, DeMartino is claiming that that did not happen.
[01:56:25.522 --> 01:56:29.365]  Just like there weren't any APCs and they weren't on the property and nothing happened.
[01:56:30.106 --> 01:56:47.698]  Okay, and the other thing is I think it's safe to say that the news I heard last night that I didn't want to say now, now that they're okay, I think it's safe to say the head of their security got a phone call from a local saying that he heard on the police scanner that they had two robots that they were going to use to go in there.
[01:56:50.123 --> 01:56:56.928]  Again, the Hunter Killers, and you laugh at them with their little treads and their shotguns now, that's 20-year-old stuff the local cops have got.
[01:56:57.188 --> 01:56:59.690]  They've got big combat mech, I mean, they've got them.
[01:56:59.970 --> 01:57:10.818]  Honolulu Advertiser, what, six years ago, they're the size of, like, a big Chevy Dually, but they're armored and they got treads, and literally, like, it was like a cartoon weapon.
[01:57:11.118 --> 01:57:14.661]  It had just guns all over the front of it, and that's what we're going to be facing.
[01:57:15.316 --> 01:57:17.999]  And of course, they'll all be remotely controlled by the Globalist.
[01:57:18.059 --> 01:57:20.100]  That cuts out the trips, so they won't even be needed soon.
[01:57:20.721 --> 01:57:29.809]  And what happens is an 18-wheeler pulls up, offloads one of these out of the back, and it just comes in your house and nerve-gases you, machine-guns you, rams right in.
[01:57:30.230 --> 01:57:31.271]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[01:57:33.913 --> 01:57:38.957]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.078 --> 01:57:50.718]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.398 --> 01:57:52.439]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.159 --> 01:57:54.319]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.919 --> 01:57:55.740]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:57.400]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.060 --> 01:58:02.022]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.242 --> 01:58:06.363]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.024 --> 01:58:10.445]  I was just talking to Weldon during the break, who again just got out of the Air Force.
[01:58:11.852 --> 01:58:15.177]  And then, not just Weldon, I mean, I trust Weldon, but I've seen the mainstream news articles.
[01:58:15.678 --> 01:58:18.543]  They usually show you the little swords they're using in Pelagia.
[01:58:19.837 --> 01:58:32.062]  And, uh, if you don't hold up your ID card that's got the tracker chip in it, this is admitted, that machine gun you, uh, Tom Brokaw, from his last broadcast, talked about how great it was, how they were killing anybody who didn't have it, and the Swords are going around killing everyone.
[01:58:32.523 --> 01:58:34.003]  But, but, but those are the little ones.
[01:58:34.243 --> 01:58:37.265]  The big ones come out of the back of an 18-wheeler or dropped by a helicopter.
[01:58:37.285 --> 01:58:37.965]  They got treads.
[01:58:38.225 --> 01:58:39.265]  They're like a mini-tank.
[01:58:39.726 --> 01:58:41.667]  They got big metal arms, tear open doors.
[01:58:41.707 --> 01:58:43.907]  They spray you with either knockout gas or nerve gas.
[01:58:44.168 --> 01:58:47.209]  They got machine guns, uh, small, uh, artillery.
[01:58:49.202 --> 01:58:52.290]  Uh, incendiary devices, you name it.
[01:58:52.891 --> 01:58:56.040]  And they've also got drones that can launch out of the top and fly up and look at you.
[01:58:56.972 --> 01:59:00.656]  And he was like, oh yeah, the Air Force, they did some drills where they had these big things.
[01:59:00.756 --> 01:59:02.837]  We've got a bomb threat, so this robot's going to come in.
[01:59:02.877 --> 01:59:05.360]  Yeah, it was like ripping open doors and doing everything else.
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:07.742]  See, they show you on the news, the little robots.
[01:59:07.802 --> 01:59:09.343]  No, no, they've got the big ones, folks.
[01:59:09.784 --> 01:59:10.664]  And they are robots.
[01:59:11.165 --> 01:59:14.528]  And half the Air Force is going to be shifted over this by 2011.
[01:59:14.948 --> 01:59:21.054]  And by 2014, they want half the ground force to be combat mechanized forces.
[01:59:21.847 --> 01:59:26.251]  Or, I mean, it's not like a Terminator robot in the classical, you know, term they use.
[01:59:26.291 --> 01:59:28.313]  They call them combat mechs.
[01:59:29.193 --> 01:59:30.895]  And, uh, this is what we're gonna be facing.
[01:59:31.408 --> 01:59:32.849]  That's why they're so arrogant right now.
[01:59:32.929 --> 01:59:33.970]  That and Mexican troops.
[01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:37.192]  And we got Randy Weaver on the line with us.
[01:59:38.032 --> 01:59:42.135]  Rick Kazee, Infowars.com, up there reporting for Infowars.com, left last night.
[01:59:43.135 --> 01:59:45.777]  He knew all this last night from the Browns, but now he can talk about it.
[01:59:45.957 --> 01:59:51.320]  They got a call from the Federal Marshal, Gary DeMartino, and they also talked to local government people.
[01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:52.081]  We're going to leave it at that.
[01:59:52.381 --> 01:59:53.602]  They're sending in robots!
[01:59:55.171 --> 01:59:56.712]  This is really scary, Alex.
[02:00:22.796 --> 02:00:26.278]  We're going to have to buck up and get some courage and be ready to stand against these guys.
[02:00:26.839 --> 02:00:28.900]  I'm really worried for the Browns out there.
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:35.644]  I was in contact with Gary Spence's office this morning.
[02:00:35.664 --> 02:00:39.326]  Of course, Gary's retired and he's not in the office and Kent was in court.
[02:00:39.887 --> 02:00:44.910]  But I talked to another attorney there and they took a bunch of information.
[02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:50.653]  Now again, he's your lawyer and he wanted a judgment for you and the wrongful death of some of your family.
[02:00:51.314 --> 02:00:51.614]  Yes.
[02:00:52.661 --> 02:00:55.983]  He's what they call a cowboy lawyer out of Wyoming.
[02:00:56.843 --> 02:01:10.729]  Anyway, they're aware of the situation and they did not tell me, you know, that they definitely wouldn't get involved in anything, but I think they're going to wait for Kent to get back to the office from court and discuss all this stuff.
[02:01:11.089 --> 02:01:13.630]  So, I'm just waiting to see what happens there.
[02:01:14.811 --> 02:01:20.013]  And I, personally, I would like to be out there and stand with these people.
[02:01:21.061 --> 02:01:21.421]  I don't know.
[02:01:21.481 --> 02:01:28.423]  I suppose they got the road blocked off now and all that, but if they had a bunch of people out there, that's what helped save us up at Ruby Ridge.
[02:01:28.563 --> 02:01:30.843]  Those of us that survived anyway.
[02:01:31.843 --> 02:01:36.184]  Well, there are some people in the house, but not quite enough.
[02:01:36.204 --> 02:01:38.145]  I don't know if we can bring up that other issue.
[02:01:38.465 --> 02:01:39.525]  Randy just mentioned it.
[02:01:39.745 --> 02:01:41.845]  Let's bring up Matt Kazee.
[02:01:41.965 --> 02:01:45.106]  Matt, can we talk about the other issue of the roads?
[02:01:46.136 --> 02:01:46.897]  Well, you know what?
[02:01:46.997 --> 02:01:49.278]  I can assure you anybody, they've got security out there.
[02:01:49.818 --> 02:01:50.699]  The Browns have security.
[02:01:50.819 --> 02:01:53.840]  Anybody who wants to come out there, the Browns are going to let you into their home.
[02:01:54.661 --> 02:01:58.263]  If you're righteous, they can smell somebody who's not righteous a mile away.
[02:01:59.203 --> 02:02:01.765]  But the bigger issue is roadblocks, what Randy just mentioned.
[02:02:02.505 --> 02:02:04.046]  You know what?
[02:02:04.626 --> 02:02:08.308]  Before you get to the house, the Browns have a couple of cars blocked there.
[02:02:10.436 --> 02:02:13.597]  I don't think the police have a roadblock up as of this yet.
[02:02:13.697 --> 02:02:15.577]  They have backed off and they've gone into the shadows.
[02:02:15.637 --> 02:02:17.477]  They're out there, but they're in the shadows.
[02:02:17.498 --> 02:02:19.018]  The local reporters did report that.
[02:02:19.078 --> 02:02:22.779]  Randy Weaver, Matt Kazee, stay there both of you.
[02:02:22.799 --> 02:02:29.340]  I want to come back and talk to Randy Weaver, one of the few people who's actually experienced this type of thing and lived to talk about it, lived to tell about it.
[02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:31.660]  We really appreciate him joining us today.
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:35.141]  We're going to come back and we're going to take some calls too.
[02:02:35.161 --> 02:02:37.822]  The toll free number to join us on this issue or any other big issues, 1-800
[02:02:39.988 --> 02:02:40.308]  2-5-9-9-2-3-1.
[02:02:41.789 --> 02:02:43.469]  PrisonPlanet.com is the website.
[02:02:45.970 --> 02:02:49.431]  It's here.
[02:02:49.611 --> 02:02:54.393]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.773 --> 02:03:02.395]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:03.112 --> 02:03:10.156]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.556 --> 02:03:22.022]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.282 --> 02:03:25.864]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.265 --> 02:03:28.206]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.506 --> 02:03:32.368]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:47.483 --> 02:03:51.985]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:52.326 --> 02:03:56.428]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:56.708 --> 02:03:57.248]  We listened.
[02:03:57.568 --> 02:04:02.531]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:02.831 --> 02:04:03.311]  We listened.
[02:04:03.692 --> 02:04:06.733]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:07.153 --> 02:04:07.694]  We listened.
[02:04:08.154 --> 02:04:12.076]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:04:12.176 --> 02:04:12.576]  Yes.
[02:04:12.596 --> 02:04:13.077]  We listened.
[02:04:13.417 --> 02:04:18.662]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:04:19.082 --> 02:04:20.423]  Again, we listened.
[02:04:20.803 --> 02:04:28.110]  Introducing the Perky Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:04:28.570 --> 02:04:31.211]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[02:04:31.411 --> 02:04:31.611]  Only $279.
[02:04:31.671 --> 02:04:36.133]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:36.193 --> 02:04:38.534]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:38.954 --> 02:04:42.255]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:42.375 --> 02:04:43.636]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:46.677 --> 02:04:48.638]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer.
[02:04:49.118 --> 02:04:51.699]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[02:04:52.543 --> 02:04:53.664]  For a while, anyway.
[02:04:54.185 --> 02:04:57.368]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[02:04:57.968 --> 02:05:00.310]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[02:05:00.611 --> 02:05:04.114]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[02:05:04.474 --> 02:05:06.716]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[02:05:07.277 --> 02:05:07.998]  What's the name again?
[02:05:08.018 --> 02:05:09.379]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[02:05:09.779 --> 02:05:10.600]  It's CalX.
[02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:11.121]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[02:05:13.439 --> 02:05:15.120]  What makes Kallax Ointment so different?
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:23.645]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[02:05:24.686 --> 02:05:29.249]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Kallax Ointment.
[02:05:29.469 --> 02:05:38.575]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[02:05:39.275 --> 02:05:40.396]  Hey, there's a drug store.
[02:05:40.436 --> 02:05:41.096]  I'll be right back.
[02:05:41.356 --> 02:05:42.297]  I'm getting some Kallax.
[02:05:43.806 --> 02:05:45.893]  Oh no!
[02:05:50.439 --> 02:05:51.119]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:52.820]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.521 --> 02:05:54.642]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.282 --> 02:05:56.102]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.863 --> 02:05:57.723]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.424 --> 02:06:02.386]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.606 --> 02:06:06.729]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.509 --> 02:06:18.656]  Randy Weaver was in a different position than the Browns in New Hampshire, outside Plainfield.
[02:06:19.518 --> 02:06:23.659]  He had a baby and he had children that already killed one child and killed his wife.
[02:06:25.179 --> 02:06:27.360]  Just in cold blood out of the clear blue sky.
[02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:30.621]  And they bragged about it later.
[02:06:31.201 --> 02:06:33.882]  But other than that, you can really parallel these two.
[02:06:33.922 --> 02:06:37.402]  But back in that day, hundreds of people showed up to stop the siege.
[02:06:37.682 --> 02:06:39.003]  But they already killed people.
[02:06:39.483 --> 02:06:44.024]  They did shoot at one gentleman who was walking his dog and kidnapping him and tell him to lie about it.
[02:06:44.961 --> 02:06:46.542]  They're now threatening him more.
[02:06:46.562 --> 02:06:49.364]  You ought to hear the stuff he's told me, but I'm not at liberty to talk about it on air.
[02:06:50.164 --> 02:06:51.505]  Maybe if he wants to call in, he can.
[02:06:51.925 --> 02:06:59.550]  Randy Weaver being in the same position, frankly a worse position than the Browns have been in, so you can definitely walk a mile in their shoes.
[02:06:59.570 --> 02:07:05.213]  You've walked a thousand miles in their shoes, having a wife and of course child attacked by these people.
[02:07:05.933 --> 02:07:06.854]  What do you think they're thinking?
[02:07:06.874 --> 02:07:07.854]  What's going through their mind?
[02:07:07.914 --> 02:07:08.935]  What advice can you give them?
[02:07:12.357 --> 02:07:13.357]  What's going through their mind?
[02:07:14.702 --> 02:07:30.054]  A zillion things at once and all the emotions and everything, but as long as they're still allowing outside people to go in to their place, I don't think they're planning an imminent, what do they call it, dynamic entry.
[02:07:32.896 --> 02:07:35.478]  They might be leaving that open right now.
[02:07:35.518 --> 02:07:40.722]  They might still be trying to get snitches in there to figure out what's going on and get the lay out of the place and all that.
[02:07:42.208 --> 02:07:49.711]  But once they block the roads off and keep people away, at least a mile or two miles away, that's when you know that it's going to come down hard on them.
[02:07:51.072 --> 02:07:53.853]  So, that's my thinking anyway.
[02:07:53.873 --> 02:07:58.055]  Are you there, Alex?
[02:07:58.095 --> 02:07:59.376]  Yeah, no, I'm just thinking.
[02:07:59.596 --> 02:08:00.836]  I'm just thinking, Randy.
[02:08:01.797 --> 02:08:03.758]  I know it's rare for me to be at a loss at words.
[02:08:04.298 --> 02:08:05.118]  Loss for words.
[02:08:05.878 --> 02:08:08.340]  I mean, what more advice would you give them?
[02:08:10.200 --> 02:08:11.481]  Just to be real cool.
[02:08:12.575 --> 02:08:23.537]  And let them fire first, because if they go in, they'll be coming in hard and heavy and real fast, and stand up and do what's right.
[02:08:25.998 --> 02:08:31.179]  But the thing is, it don't matter who fires first, they're going to blame them anyway if it gets into that situation.
[02:08:32.779 --> 02:08:35.980]  When it's all said and done, it's most likely
[02:08:37.307 --> 02:08:44.134]  Might be real lucky if there's anybody left on their side to defend him, but the feds will just claim it's all their fault and leave it at that and get away with it.
[02:08:46.996 --> 02:08:53.002]  Now you talked of course to the Browns yesterday and you've been discussing going there?
[02:08:53.022 --> 02:08:57.146]  Yes, but I can't afford to right now.
[02:08:58.425 --> 02:09:00.086]  And I refuse to fly.
[02:09:00.266 --> 02:09:03.727]  I'm not going to take my boots off these foreigners that tell you that they want to search and all that.
[02:09:04.387 --> 02:09:05.927]  You don't like foreigners jabbing you?
[02:09:06.227 --> 02:09:07.047]  Well, I mean, did you hear?
[02:09:07.107 --> 02:09:14.209]  They're going to... The Pentagon's lobbying for the End of America Amnesty Bill so they can make the majority of the troops illegal alien.
[02:09:14.250 --> 02:09:14.830]  Did you hear that?
[02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:18.091]  Oh, really?
[02:09:18.351 --> 02:09:18.951]  I'm not kidding.
[02:09:18.971 --> 02:09:19.991]  They're right out in the open.
[02:09:20.011 --> 02:09:20.251]  Yes.
[02:09:20.891 --> 02:09:21.352]  Oh, wow.
[02:09:22.372 --> 02:09:26.433]  Well, all I've got to say is you better keep your thoughts right, people of this country.
[02:09:27.518 --> 02:09:28.998]  It's coming down the pike.
[02:09:29.899 --> 02:09:36.480]  I'm not a religious man, but I know there's a lot of religious folks out there that think that the big beast is going to take over the one world government.
[02:09:38.521 --> 02:09:42.602]  Whether that's true the way they're saying it, I believe it's going to happen.
[02:09:42.842 --> 02:09:44.142]  They want a one world government.
[02:09:45.042 --> 02:09:47.083]  This country, they've got to destroy us.
[02:09:48.163 --> 02:09:51.204]  Khrushchev said he's going to destroy us from within, and that's what they're doing.
[02:09:53.204 --> 02:09:54.424]  Well, they're not playing games.
[02:09:54.464 --> 02:09:56.185]  That much is clear.
[02:09:58.540 --> 02:10:01.382]  I guarantee, well, Randy, I mean, what would it cost?
[02:10:01.442 --> 02:10:05.164]  A few thousand to be able to get you a rental car to drive out there?
[02:10:05.824 --> 02:10:11.147]  All I want is expenses and I could probably get there on a thousand bucks and have money left over.
[02:10:11.167 --> 02:10:13.988]  I can drive my pickup.
[02:10:14.108 --> 02:10:15.689]  It's kind of tough on gas.
[02:10:16.009 --> 02:10:23.994]  Well, I mean, again, I don't want to put you in a position you've been through enough as an accessory to any of this which they're trying to claim.
[02:10:24.014 --> 02:10:26.515]  So I would just say that go there as a reporter
[02:10:27.667 --> 02:10:38.710]  Go there to bring attention to this as a negotiator to try to keep the feds from coming in and killing them and I think I can definitely try to fund sending you up there.
[02:10:38.730 --> 02:10:40.310]  I mean, Randy, that's really what you want to do.
[02:10:41.010 --> 02:10:44.531]  Well, get me a press badge and I'll stick it on my chest and wait.
[02:10:45.331 --> 02:10:51.792]  I can't leave until after about Thursday morning, about 8.30 in the morning.
[02:10:51.852 --> 02:10:54.533]  I've got to be at the airport to sign my
[02:10:55.109 --> 02:10:57.090]  Signed papers so my daughter will have a guardian.
[02:10:57.130 --> 02:11:05.894]  My youngest daughter is with me and she's flying to Montana to be with her sisters for the summer and I have to be there to sign it over so they can get on the plane and go.
[02:11:06.134 --> 02:11:08.815]  Now I understand at the same time that we got to really think this through.
[02:11:08.835 --> 02:11:13.398]  If we start sending you and there's any delay that might make them rush the raid.
[02:11:13.418 --> 02:11:18.480]  So let's uh let's let's talk about it over the next day but I think adding
[02:11:20.094 --> 02:11:26.019]  Randy Weaver to this, will give it the national attention it deserves, and may defuse this.
[02:11:26.059 --> 02:11:26.619]  What do you think?
[02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:30.182]  Yeah, if it helps, I mean, I'm more than willing to do it.
[02:11:31.803 --> 02:11:47.474]  I talked to Ed and Elaine on the phone, they sound just like really nice people, and I'm sure they are, and they've worked hard all their lives, and he's a dentist, and he's a building contractor, they're not stupid people, and they're serious, they're doing this out of principle.
[02:11:49.805 --> 02:11:55.787]  Well, the Federal Marshal, Gary DeMartino, didn't call him and he said, it's all threats, of course.
[02:11:55.807 --> 02:11:56.807]  We're not coming in tonight.
[02:11:57.268 --> 02:11:58.668]  We're probably not coming in tomorrow.
[02:11:58.968 --> 02:12:00.309]  But we're coming in after that.
[02:12:00.809 --> 02:12:03.390]  Let's bring up Matt Kazee.
[02:12:03.470 --> 02:12:07.531]  Matt, specifically, word for word, what did Ed and Elaine Brown tell you today when you finally got a call in to them?
[02:12:08.611 --> 02:12:15.374]  Well, they said that they were safe and that everything was quiet, but that they did get the call from the Marshal this morning, just like I said.
[02:12:15.414 --> 02:12:19.075]  I wanted to tell Randy, Randy, it's good to talk to you, but I wanted to tell you about the layout of the house.
[02:12:19.434 --> 02:12:20.754]  They have already raided the house.
[02:12:21.094 --> 02:12:23.095]  Okay, they arrested Ed and they raided the house.
[02:12:23.135 --> 02:12:24.495]  They videotaped the whole thing.
[02:12:24.815 --> 02:12:27.216]  They've got the whole layout in their hands right now.
[02:12:28.116 --> 02:12:30.356]  Oh, when did you, uh, they got Ed now?
[02:12:30.936 --> 02:12:31.357]  No, no, no, no.
[02:12:31.377 --> 02:12:32.377]  This was a few years ago.
[02:12:32.777 --> 02:12:33.037]  Right.
[02:12:33.157 --> 02:12:34.057]  Oh, okay.
[02:12:34.297 --> 02:12:34.637]  Okay.
[02:12:36.097 --> 02:12:47.680]  Well, I don't know, uh, you know, they, they... I suppose they've changed tactics and they're planning all the time and... Uh, I don't know what to say, but, uh,
[02:12:49.057 --> 02:12:56.540]  I still say that if they're allowing people, until they block them off, as soon as they block that road, it sounds to me like when they're going to make their move.
[02:12:56.560 --> 02:13:00.161]  Well, yeah, they already did that last Thursday, but then when they got caught, they pulled back.
[02:13:00.201 --> 02:13:00.962]  But they're in the woods.
[02:13:00.982 --> 02:13:02.322]  The reporters confirmed that yesterday.
[02:13:02.342 --> 02:13:03.282]  They're sneaking around.
[02:13:03.923 --> 02:13:06.283]  When you talk to the Browns, though, they don't have a way of knowing, Danny.
[02:13:07.344 --> 02:13:09.345]  We've got Denny Riley on the line about to go to him.
[02:13:09.385 --> 02:13:12.926]  Matt, when you talk to them, they don't have any way of knowing if the roads are blocked, do they?
[02:13:13.764 --> 02:13:17.009]  No, they do have some outside sources that can call.
[02:13:17.389 --> 02:13:19.893]  But you know, Alex, hey, they had already blocked off the road.
[02:13:19.933 --> 02:13:21.795]  They did that two mile quarantine type thing.
[02:13:21.835 --> 02:13:22.837]  They evacuated neighbors.
[02:13:23.097 --> 02:13:25.841]  Bottom line is, Alex, you're breaking this thing wide open.
[02:13:26.602 --> 02:13:28.905]  Just like we've done the whole truth movement.
[02:13:28.945 --> 02:13:30.107]  This is the summer of truth.
[02:13:30.526 --> 02:13:34.227]  Their whole thing's falling apart, and I'm telling you, you're saving the day.
[02:13:34.287 --> 02:13:37.488]  We need to push this thing to the top, because we're going to win this.
[02:13:37.508 --> 02:13:39.889]  The one last thing I want to say, and I'll get off here and let y'all finish.
[02:13:40.249 --> 02:13:44.450]  I just got a call, and there have been two police officers sitting outside my house since I got there.
[02:13:46.091 --> 02:13:46.491]  Really?
[02:13:47.151 --> 02:13:47.431]  Yep.
[02:13:50.332 --> 02:13:51.653]  What are they going to do?
[02:13:51.713 --> 02:13:56.654]  Arrest you for trying to take some people, trying to stop mudsheds?
[02:13:57.435 --> 02:13:58.475]  I have no idea.
[02:13:58.976 --> 02:14:04.639]  But, I mean, clearly, as soon as I got to Plainville, they showed up and they've been sitting outside my house since.
[02:14:04.919 --> 02:14:09.502]  Well, listen, I want you to go, you ought to go on your cell phone and walk out to them right now.
[02:14:10.062 --> 02:14:12.944]  Well, no, I'm in Scranton, Pennsylvania, heading home.
[02:14:13.384 --> 02:14:14.745]  Oh, they're waiting for you.
[02:14:15.725 --> 02:14:16.766]  I hope they're not waiting.
[02:14:16.886 --> 02:14:18.207]  When I get there, I hope they're gone.
[02:14:18.927 --> 02:14:19.967]  How long have they been there?
[02:14:20.468 --> 02:14:21.188]  For two days.
[02:14:22.049 --> 02:14:23.529]  Well, on and off for two days.
[02:14:25.290 --> 02:14:26.271]  Are they local cops?
[02:14:26.815 --> 02:14:27.015]  Yes.
[02:14:27.395 --> 02:14:28.595]  Now, you live on the University.
[02:14:28.615 --> 02:14:29.556]  Are they University cops?
[02:14:30.216 --> 02:14:33.096]  No, from what I gather, it was Blacksburg City Police.
[02:14:34.157 --> 02:14:42.819]  Okay, well I'm going to call and ask why a freelance reporter has police at his house.
[02:14:42.839 --> 02:14:46.780]  This is Blacksburg, where they definitely ran that black off of that shooting a few months ago.
[02:14:47.220 --> 02:14:49.000]  Big mine control facility nearby there.
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:50.400]  That's a whole other subject.
[02:14:51.361 --> 02:14:52.821]  But boy, this is freedom, isn't it?
[02:14:53.564 --> 02:14:57.767]  Yeah, well, it's because you're winning, Alex, and I'm telling you, it's the summer of truth.
[02:14:58.067 --> 02:14:59.108]  We're breaking this thing wide.
[02:14:59.128 --> 02:15:00.149]  This is just the beginning.
[02:15:00.449 --> 02:15:02.370]  This house of cards is coming tumbling down.
[02:15:03.991 --> 02:15:08.475]  So you're on your way home after reporting there for a day, and they've got police at your house.
[02:15:09.395 --> 02:15:09.776]  They did.
[02:15:09.796 --> 02:15:12.898]  The last conversation I had was last night before I went to bed.
[02:15:12.938 --> 02:15:18.842]  I got a call about it, and they had stayed out there on and off for the past two days.
[02:15:20.834 --> 02:15:22.215]  So I haven't talked to anybody today.
[02:15:22.255 --> 02:15:23.575]  I'm getting ready to call and find out.
[02:15:23.615 --> 02:15:24.796]  I just wanted to let you know though.
[02:15:24.836 --> 02:15:27.757]  No, you need to call immediately so we know by the end of the show.
[02:15:28.197 --> 02:15:28.737]  Okay.
[02:15:28.777 --> 02:15:33.359]  You need to call the Blacksburg Police Department and say, listen, I'm told the police are out front my house.
[02:15:33.379 --> 02:15:39.321]  Can I have a detective or can you find out why, you know, uh, why there are people outside my house?
[02:15:39.942 --> 02:15:42.363]  Well, let me call a neighbor first and see if they're out there.
[02:15:42.543 --> 02:15:45.784]  And, uh, you know, if, if they're gone at this point and they haven't been there all day,
[02:15:46.540 --> 02:15:50.722]  Um, I'm probably going to take my chances, but as I get closer... No, don't take your chances!
[02:15:51.362 --> 02:15:51.583]  Okay.
[02:15:51.623 --> 02:15:52.883]  Let me tell you, not with Blacksburg.
[02:15:52.923 --> 02:15:54.284]  That's known CIA, buddy.
[02:15:54.324 --> 02:15:58.686]  They'll grease you right out in the street and claim you were Popeye the Sailor Man.
[02:15:59.326 --> 02:16:03.449]  You know, Alex, I don't know if you have heard this yet, but we found that underground DARPA base.
[02:16:03.789 --> 02:16:05.309]  I know, but it came up in documents.
[02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:08.551]  Yes, yes, that may be why they're out there.
[02:16:08.571 --> 02:16:11.132]  It may not be the other reason.
[02:16:11.312 --> 02:16:14.334]  Do you know a guy named Steve Elliott from Blacksburg?
[02:16:15.436 --> 02:16:16.857]  It sounds really familiar.
[02:16:17.338 --> 02:16:19.760]  He runs C&E Gun Shows?
[02:16:21.882 --> 02:16:23.544]  It sounds familiar, but I don't know him.
[02:16:24.264 --> 02:16:25.686]  Pretty big town.
[02:16:26.346 --> 02:16:31.671]  He's a really good guy, and I'm going to give him a call and see if he's heard anything through the grapevine or anything going on.
[02:16:31.691 --> 02:16:33.053]  That would be great, Randy.
[02:16:33.613 --> 02:16:33.853]  Much.
[02:16:34.014 --> 02:16:34.274]  Alright.
[02:16:35.174 --> 02:16:37.455]  All right, Matt, you go ahead and call right now.
[02:16:37.495 --> 02:16:38.595]  Let's find out what's going on.
[02:16:38.615 --> 02:16:39.956]  Let's go ahead and go to Danny Riley.
[02:16:39.996 --> 02:16:42.217]  I don't know how much Danny wants to say about what he's been going through.
[02:16:42.237 --> 02:16:46.899]  He's the fellow shot at and tasered for no reason and told a lot of the media what you refuse to do.
[02:16:46.959 --> 02:16:47.799]  Danny, what's going on?
[02:16:49.159 --> 02:16:50.660]  Uh, no, no, I'm just a nervous wreck.
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:53.481]  Uh, uh, just a nervous wreck.
[02:16:54.241 --> 02:17:00.224]  But, um, they got my Google account blocked, so I can't upload any more videos on YouTube.
[02:17:01.124 --> 02:17:02.044]  Well, you just created a new identity.
[02:17:05.339 --> 02:17:06.660]  Yeah, well I haven't tried anything.
[02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:07.361]  I just found out.
[02:17:07.381 --> 02:17:10.284]  I just got in from doing a job and turned on the radio and heard you guys talking.
[02:17:10.565 --> 02:17:11.986]  I heard you say call in, so I did.
[02:17:12.006 --> 02:17:14.929]  How much did they say about what they've been saying to you?
[02:17:15.790 --> 02:17:17.232]  Uh, they contacted me again.
[02:17:17.252 --> 02:17:24.860]  Uh, and uh, basically, uh, hanging stuff over my head to get me to try to do things they want me to do.
[02:17:26.232 --> 02:17:29.535]  And I told him I'm not going to be, you know, the Benedict Arnold of my generation.
[02:17:29.575 --> 02:17:31.636]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:17:31.656 --> 02:17:33.158]  Well, Randy wouldn't do that either.
[02:17:33.178 --> 02:17:34.258]  You know what he did to his wife.
[02:17:34.859 --> 02:17:35.840]  Real nice people.
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:39.162]  Come back with Randy Weaver, Danny Reilly.
[02:17:39.923 --> 02:17:40.724]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:17:40.764 --> 02:17:42.445]  This is the Fall of the Republic.
[02:17:46.667 --> 02:17:54.632]  Attention women over 40, if you want to look as much as 20 years younger in less than one minute, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:17:54.832 --> 02:17:55.432]  Here's why.
[02:17:55.552 --> 02:17:59.835]  There's a brand new cosmetic product that makes wrinkles almost invisible to the naked eye.
[02:17:59.995 --> 02:18:05.138]  In fact, the new product allows some women to look so young so fast that it makes them feel like they're cheating.
[02:18:05.398 --> 02:18:07.119]  They are in a way, but it works.
[02:18:07.459 --> 02:18:11.041]  By the way, it's also a jealously guarded secret used by professional models.
[02:18:11.261 --> 02:18:16.225]  You see, these women often have to look much younger than they really are, or else they lose their jobs.
[02:18:16.445 --> 02:18:23.610]  The product uses something like a magician's trick to actually de-age the appearance of human skin, and it's now available to listeners of this station.
[02:18:23.810 --> 02:18:28.153]  Want to take years off your appearance and don't want cosmetic surgery or painful injections?
[02:18:28.353 --> 02:18:33.257]  There is now a very real chance you can do it with this new cream called Simply Magician's Formula 987.
[02:18:33.317 --> 02:18:34.537]  Just go to 987magic.com.
[02:18:34.557 --> 02:18:34.938]  That's 987magic.com.

[02:18:52.791 --> 02:18:57.615]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:57.815 --> 02:19:00.557]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:19:00.597 --> 02:19:01.718]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:19:03.059 --> 02:19:07.582]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:08.567 --> 02:19:15.831]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.

[02:21:46.727 --> 02:21:51.870]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:54.831]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:56.261 --> 02:22:10.451]  Well, I can't think of a better reporter to send in to the Brown property, at least buy him some more time before the feds come in and kill him, than former Green Beret and Patriot Randy Weaver from the Ruby Ridge Seed, one of the survivors.
[02:22:12.553 --> 02:22:22.940]  Going back to Danny Riley, who got shot at and all this happened, Randy Weaver, it's just amazing just to see the level of lying, but you've experienced this before, haven't you?
[02:22:23.567 --> 02:22:28.989]  Yes, that's all they did to us, before and after Ruby Ridge.
[02:22:29.269 --> 02:22:31.050]  After the results had been, go to court.
[02:22:31.770 --> 02:22:34.851]  Those guys lied to the grand jury and then they lied in court.
[02:22:35.171 --> 02:22:39.053]  They had two or three different stories by the time they got in to court when we were in there.
[02:22:40.493 --> 02:22:50.497]  And, you know, the courts have recognized and admitted that cops lie under oath, and the Supreme Court has said that that's alright.
[02:22:51.758 --> 02:22:51.978]  So,
[02:22:53.149 --> 02:22:53.689]  There you go.
[02:22:54.429 --> 02:22:56.010]  But juries aren't supposed to know that.
[02:22:57.070 --> 02:22:57.490]  Well, no.
[02:22:57.550 --> 02:23:07.133]  I don't get how cops all the time, I see videos of it, know people, they'll beat you up, and then you don't even resist, and they charge you with felonies for assaulting them when they beat you up.
[02:23:07.413 --> 02:23:08.613]  I mean, how do they sleep at night?
[02:23:08.733 --> 02:23:10.054]  Whatever happened to them?
[02:23:10.774 --> 02:23:11.474]  They're criminals!
[02:23:12.194 --> 02:23:14.455]  They have no morals or principles anymore.
[02:23:14.535 --> 02:23:15.835]  They are paid mercenaries.
[02:23:15.855 --> 02:23:16.736]  They're there for a buck.
[02:23:16.836 --> 02:23:17.576]  That's why they do it.
[02:23:19.836 --> 02:23:21.557]  No other answers for butts about it.
[02:23:24.548 --> 02:23:25.869]  Danny, what else is happening?
[02:23:25.909 --> 02:23:31.330]  I mean, if you want to talk about it, I don't know how much you can say, but... I think it's just a matter of time before I'm in jail.
[02:23:32.151 --> 02:23:33.251]  That's all I have, you know.
[02:23:33.611 --> 02:23:35.772]  I think it's just a matter of time before they come and take me.
[02:23:36.072 --> 02:23:37.072]  I mean, I got a lawyer.
[02:23:37.673 --> 02:23:41.194]  My lawyer called the Boston field office yesterday.
[02:23:43.575 --> 02:23:47.996]  Opened the lines of communication to have them call him instead of calling me.
[02:23:48.016 --> 02:23:49.097]  And, uh...
[02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:55.813]  They keep warning me to stop telling people that the FBI is involved.
[02:23:58.454 --> 02:24:19.627]  And the FBI guy who called me and gave me one of them deals I couldn't refuse, and I turned it down, and then I turn on Ed Brown's show, between two and three, and he talks about this infiltrator and all that, and describes the guy's features and looks, and I'm like, that's the FBI guy who's been calling me!
[02:24:20.319 --> 02:24:21.920]  Now, he's got a beard.
[02:24:23.941 --> 02:24:24.841]  Describe what he looks like.
[02:24:27.443 --> 02:24:31.185]  This is just digging my hole deeper, but I guess I'll take one for the country.
[02:24:31.205 --> 02:24:31.965]  That's what I told him.
[02:24:32.025 --> 02:24:32.485]  I don't care.
[02:24:32.525 --> 02:24:33.666]  I'll go down for the country.
[02:24:33.706 --> 02:24:35.467]  You haven't done anything wrong, sir.
[02:24:35.507 --> 02:24:36.047]  Don't worry about it.
[02:24:36.067 --> 02:24:36.407]  He's about 5'7", 5'6".
[02:24:36.647 --> 02:24:37.468]  All black hair, black beard.
[02:24:37.488 --> 02:24:38.368]  Nice and groomed.
[02:24:46.607 --> 02:24:57.652]  Well, Stocky Bill, he was grabbing his beer and grooming it, and that's what touched me off when I said he kept grooming his beard and that, and I was like, that's the guy who was questioning me and, you know, has been calling me.
[02:24:58.712 --> 02:25:00.073]  So that's my opinion.
[02:25:00.173 --> 02:25:01.654]  And what's his first name go by?
[02:25:03.275 --> 02:25:05.556]  Um, should I say that on the air, Alex?
[02:25:05.656 --> 02:25:06.076]  I don't know.
[02:25:06.096 --> 02:25:09.317]  Yeah, come on!
[02:25:09.337 --> 02:25:10.938]  He tells me his first name's Phil.
[02:25:11.458 --> 02:25:13.159]  Yeah, that's the one, you've already said his name before.
[02:25:13.179 --> 02:25:15.360]  I don't know who that is.
[02:25:17.491 --> 02:25:22.533]  I'm sure for my life, both ways of being killed and just being locked away for good.
[02:25:23.174 --> 02:25:25.695]  Well, all you did was go on the property to see what was going on.
[02:25:26.375 --> 02:25:27.835]  Randy, you were about to say something?
[02:25:27.855 --> 02:25:30.196]  Yeah, but they don't make you feel like that, you know what I'm saying?
[02:25:30.316 --> 02:25:30.736]  I understand.
[02:25:30.756 --> 02:25:32.657]  Well, that's what they live in, fear, because they live in fear.
[02:25:33.297 --> 02:25:34.358]  Randy, comments?
[02:25:35.058 --> 02:25:41.700]  Well, I guess that if I was in that position, I mean, I'd be so darn mad at them.
[02:25:41.780 --> 02:25:42.841]  I wouldn't talk to them.
[02:25:47.148 --> 02:25:48.008]  You know, there's two words.
[02:25:48.048 --> 02:25:48.568]  Don't talk.
[02:25:48.608 --> 02:25:49.309]  You don't have to.
[02:25:49.809 --> 02:25:53.490]  And just tell them they can converse with you through your attorney and that's it.
[02:25:53.550 --> 02:25:53.910]  Period.
[02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:59.452]  That's what I... I hope they don't call me anymore and that's why I'm kind of trying to get this on the air to stop calling me.
[02:25:59.472 --> 02:26:01.213]  I'm not going to do any of your deals.
[02:26:01.773 --> 02:26:04.014]  Well, it's going to make it hard for them to charge you.
[02:26:04.054 --> 02:26:08.215]  The fact that they tried to make you an informant and tried to put you through your paces.
[02:26:09.086 --> 02:26:11.867]  And then threatened you with jail time if you didn't serve them.
[02:26:12.687 --> 02:26:14.107]  That's extortion.
[02:26:14.167 --> 02:26:14.827]  That's criminal.
[02:26:15.188 --> 02:26:16.248]  That's official oppression.
[02:26:16.288 --> 02:26:17.368]  Then you just leave you alone.
[02:26:17.388 --> 02:26:20.949]  And another thing, I'd like to give you a piece of advice.
[02:26:21.469 --> 02:26:24.090]  If you've got a tape recorder, tape record anything.
[02:26:24.110 --> 02:26:27.190]  Anytime they call you, tape record every conversation.
[02:26:27.430 --> 02:26:28.791]  How do you tape record a cell phone?
[02:26:29.511 --> 02:26:30.531]  I put it on speaker phone.
[02:26:30.571 --> 02:26:33.132]  I got my little hand-held recorder right here.
[02:26:33.292 --> 02:26:34.192]  Oh, you've been recording it?
[02:26:34.955 --> 02:26:35.895]  No, I didn't this time.
[02:26:35.935 --> 02:26:39.096]  He just called me out of the blue, you know, and I didn't have my recorder ready.
[02:26:39.116 --> 02:26:41.017]  How many times has he called you since you got back?
[02:26:42.057 --> 02:26:42.237]  Once.
[02:26:42.558 --> 02:26:45.559]  He told me I wasn't through out of the woods, and, you know, he had my cell phone.
[02:26:45.599 --> 02:26:51.661]  He took my number, and, uh, sure enough, he called me, you know, and gave me an offer I can't refuse.
[02:26:51.701 --> 02:26:54.582]  You're looking at this time in jail if you don't do this.
[02:26:54.602 --> 02:26:58.523]  I mean... You know, Alex, they've got those recorders that, uh,
[02:26:59.406 --> 02:27:07.770]  They've got a little suction cup microphone on them and you can suction cup that to your cell phone or any phone and it'll pick up both conversations.
[02:27:08.570 --> 02:27:11.511]  It's just a matter of time before I'm picked up and taken away.
[02:27:11.552 --> 02:27:12.152]  I know that.
[02:27:12.592 --> 02:27:12.872]  You know?
[02:27:13.572 --> 02:27:14.713]  It's just a matter of time.
[02:27:14.753 --> 02:27:16.394]  They're just after the big fish right now.
[02:27:19.555 --> 02:27:22.216]  Well, destroying America is quite a fun job.
[02:27:22.256 --> 02:27:23.297]  I really enjoy it.
[02:27:23.317 --> 02:27:26.358]  Of course, they'll have nothing at the end of it either, but I don't care.
[02:27:26.378 --> 02:27:27.979]  It's all part of the fun.
[02:27:28.983 --> 02:27:29.664]  Stay there, gentlemen.
[02:27:29.684 --> 02:27:31.865]  I want to do one more little segment with both of you.
[02:27:36.328 --> 02:27:37.229]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.729 --> 02:27:39.330]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.251 --> 02:27:42.933]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.852 --> 02:27:57.835]  JLS Research, the makers of all-natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[02:27:58.055 --> 02:28:04.537]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[02:28:04.717 --> 02:28:12.399]  By using organics and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[02:28:12.599 --> 02:28:13.299]  As it responds,
[02:28:13.579 --> 02:28:15.601]  Body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[02:28:15.881 --> 02:28:17.722]  First Responder is the first of its kind.
[02:28:17.802 --> 02:28:19.383]  Comprised of only four organics.
[02:28:19.684 --> 02:28:22.966]  Grape seed skim, grape seed, grapefruit seed, and garlic.
[02:28:23.346 --> 02:28:27.830]  It's so effective you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[02:28:28.130 --> 02:28:30.672]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.
[02:28:30.932 --> 02:28:34.414]  Go online and order First Responder at no-bo.com.
[02:28:34.615 --> 02:28:37.977]  Visit no-bo.com or call JLS Research at 850-723-8599.
[02:28:40.879 --> 02:28:41.060]  That's 850-723-8599.
[02:28:45.777 --> 02:28:47.417]  Not making the money you were expecting?

[02:28:49.658 --> 02:28:51.598]  It's not that that business is not performing.
[02:28:51.818 --> 02:28:54.139]  It's simply that you don't have the proper tools to succeed.
[02:28:54.339 --> 02:28:57.700]  Take it from me, Craig Walcott, producer of Exercise is Suicide.

[02:29:48.754 --> 02:29:53.318]  You nurture it, giving up your time and energy just to make sure it grows and stays healthy.
[02:29:53.598 --> 02:29:56.820]  You sacrifice yourself to give it every chance at success.
[02:29:57.221 --> 02:29:58.622]  But if you haven't incorporated yet,
[02:29:59.585 --> 02:30:01.286]  It could all disappear in an instant.

[02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:24.040]  Call 1-800-497-5991.
[02:30:28.343 --> 02:30:31.585]  One of the things that made me see red last night was reading a story out of Pennsylvania.
[02:30:58.163 --> 02:31:02.710]  When the cops pull these people over, the cop starts yelling at them, so the guy pulls a camera and starts videotaping.
[02:31:03.231 --> 02:31:09.041]  And he arrests him, and then points out that he's videotaping and recording them off a lapel microphone.
[02:31:11.390 --> 02:31:16.296]  Wiretapping is sneaking into somebody's house or recording something in a business you're not authorized to.
[02:31:16.857 --> 02:31:18.679]  Wiretapping is not videotaping cops.
[02:31:18.699 --> 02:31:21.282]  I've had cops walk up and we're not allowed to videotape me, that's wiretapping.
[02:31:21.583 --> 02:31:23.685]  I go ahead and arrest me, you know that's a false charge.
[02:31:24.005 --> 02:31:29.152]  That'd be like arresting somebody for arson because they were grilling hamburgers in their backyard.
[02:31:30.266 --> 02:31:35.189]  Or that would be like convicting someone of manslaughter because they stepped on a cockroach.
[02:31:35.690 --> 02:31:37.211]  It isn't a true charge.
[02:31:37.751 --> 02:31:38.191]  Doesn't matter.
[02:31:38.231 --> 02:31:42.194]  District Attorney's going ahead with felony charges against an 18-year-old.
[02:31:42.234 --> 02:31:43.655]  And I got cases all over the country.
[02:31:43.675 --> 02:31:45.676]  We got a man on the line who beat it in federal court.
[02:31:47.277 --> 02:31:49.238]  And I want to just give everybody a news flash here.
[02:31:50.299 --> 02:31:52.300]  But see, that just shows the tyranny.
[02:31:53.381 --> 02:31:54.542]  We're about to go back to Randy Weaver.
[02:31:54.922 --> 02:31:56.123]  We appreciate him coming on with us.
[02:31:56.183 --> 02:31:57.224]  And I'll call him later today.
[02:31:57.244 --> 02:31:59.145]  We'll see about maybe him going up to the property.
[02:32:01.121 --> 02:32:03.742]  God only knows, I'll probably charge him as El Cado if he does that.
[02:32:04.382 --> 02:32:09.883]  Before we go any further, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to tell you about researchedherbs.com.

[02:32:51.022 --> 02:32:52.544]  That's researchtoherbs.com or 1-800-845-3841.
[02:32:52.584 --> 02:32:53.865]  That's just one of the products.
[02:32:53.885 --> 02:32:54.906]  They've got hundreds.
[02:32:55.266 --> 02:32:56.708]  It's the well-researched, well-documented ones.
[02:33:05.516 --> 02:33:08.637]  Another fine company we have is Blacklistedherbs.com.
[02:33:09.078 --> 02:33:15.841]  Blacklistedherbs.com has the stuff that Big Brother doesn't want you to have.
[02:33:15.861 --> 02:33:18.882]  I looked into this ionic form of mineral.
[02:33:19.342 --> 02:33:20.363]  Very, very popular.
[02:33:20.383 --> 02:33:22.343]  A lot of big write-ups, a lot of big studies.
[02:33:22.364 --> 02:33:24.925]  You can read about it at Blacklistedherbs.com.
[02:33:24.965 --> 02:33:28.406]  Their particular preparation of this is patented and called Shilicene.
[02:33:28.926 --> 02:33:32.448]  Solutions from Science in Thomas, Illinois has made it as easy as you can imagine.
[02:33:33.622 --> 02:33:34.862]  No credit card numbers, nothing.
[02:33:34.882 --> 02:33:38.163]  They just send you an invoice with a three-month supply you get.
[02:33:38.923 --> 02:33:42.124]  And then if you like it and you want to pay for it, pay for it and get some more.
[02:33:42.844 --> 02:33:43.124]  That's it.
[02:33:43.144 --> 02:33:44.565]  You just give them your name and they send it to you.
[02:33:44.985 --> 02:33:46.005]  And they send you an invoice.
[02:33:46.125 --> 02:33:48.126]  And you don't have to pay for it if you don't like it.
[02:33:48.826 --> 02:33:54.627]  I mean, that's not the deal where you give them the credit card number and then if you remember to send it back, you get it back.
[02:33:55.268 --> 02:33:56.868]  No, this is just they want you to try it.
[02:33:58.165 --> 02:34:07.828]  So give them a call 1-877-327-0365 877-327-0365 or blacklistedherb.com.
[02:34:07.888 --> 02:34:13.470]  Now, I have been so busy today, I haven't even plugged my films in two hours and 36 minutes.
[02:34:14.550 --> 02:34:15.650]  I've made 15 films.
[02:34:15.750 --> 02:34:16.811]  Terror Storm is sold out.
[02:34:17.371 --> 02:34:18.611]  We can't sell it individually.
[02:34:19.111 --> 02:34:24.453]  With the Everything Special and a few combo specials, we've got like, I think, 30 copies left now, or less.
[02:34:25.166 --> 02:34:29.128]  When those are gone in a couple days, there won't be any more available of Terror Storm First Edition ever.
[02:34:29.468 --> 02:34:30.888]  Final Cut comes out next month.
[02:34:31.608 --> 02:34:31.929]  Okay?
[02:34:32.389 --> 02:34:34.009]  We'll start pre-orders for that next week.
[02:34:34.990 --> 02:34:40.492]  But, uh, I don't know what to do with all the other combo orders that still have Terror Storm in it, because I don't want to get those out to you.
[02:34:41.232 --> 02:34:42.653]  Because we'll be out of it in a few days.
[02:34:42.753 --> 02:34:46.874]  But Sale IV, I think I may be able, from the distributor, to get like 50 more or something.
[02:34:46.894 --> 02:34:50.295]  We may be able to keep the sale going until next week, because it's just with the combos.
[02:34:50.796 --> 02:34:54.097]  But that's available at InfoWars.com for a super, you know, uh,
[02:34:55.114 --> 02:35:16.724]  A small period of time, but you can still get American Freedom from Fascism, Loose Change, Second Edition, 9-11, Demolitions, all the other films we carry, and my 14 other films, like my three police state films that are 45% off, Infowars.com, and it is your purchase of the films that allows us to, you know, have reporters and write news articles and do what we do and cover what we're covering.
[02:35:17.404 --> 02:35:20.105]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, it is so important
[02:35:20.856 --> 02:35:31.686]  For you, go to Infowars.com and get the videos or call toll-free 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:32.647 --> 02:35:36.971]  Randy Weaver, I want to thank you for coming on with us today.
[02:35:39.333 --> 02:35:47.340]  It's such an important decision that I can't sit here and egg you on and tell you to go over to the Brown family's home up there.
[02:35:48.411 --> 02:36:01.861]  But, you know, if you talked to him yesterday and you want to go, and that's something you want to do, I mean, obviously, I would just go to try to keep people from getting killed, as you said, and as long as that's your public position, I can't see the Feds trying to concoct something on you.
[02:36:02.281 --> 02:36:04.603]  And that would force this into national attention.
[02:36:05.223 --> 02:36:14.970]  Randy Weaver of the Ruby Ridge Massacre and Siege, you know, putting himself back in that position again, that's an amazing story alone.
[02:36:16.046 --> 02:36:21.050]  But we'll definitely get a headline out there that you're ready and willing to go.
[02:36:21.751 --> 02:36:25.654]  And as soon as you're done with your daughter this Thursday, well, let's see what you want to do then, my friend.
[02:36:26.514 --> 02:36:26.855]  Okay.
[02:36:26.875 --> 02:36:29.617]  I appreciate you having me on the show and I'll talk to you after a while.
[02:36:29.957 --> 02:36:44.208]  Now, I know you didn't come on for this, but since you talk about, you know, after everything you've been through, not even having the finances to go up there, why don't you give people out an address or some way they can get your book.
[02:36:44.228 --> 02:36:45.309]  There's two books, actually.
[02:36:46.025 --> 02:36:48.868]  And then, uh, and your address or any websites or anything else?
[02:36:49.668 --> 02:37:08.165]  Okay, uh, the Federal Seizure of Ruby Ridge, in our own words, uh, by myself and my daughter, Sarah, they can get that book through GOA, Larry Pratchett, Gun Owners of America, and also through Deldapress.com.
[02:37:08.605 --> 02:37:10.747]  That's out of El Dorado, Arkansas.
[02:37:11.889 --> 02:37:13.070]  El Dorado, Arkansas.
[02:37:13.691 --> 02:37:16.194]  You can get it there from that, give that website out again?
[02:37:16.834 --> 02:37:18.075]  DeltaPress.com.
[02:37:18.276 --> 02:37:18.896]  Delta Press.
[02:37:19.177 --> 02:37:22.200]  And then of course, GunOwners.org, folks.
[02:37:22.220 --> 02:37:25.003]  We have them on routinely, or what is it?
[02:37:25.023 --> 02:37:25.623]  1-888-6GUNS?
[02:37:26.924 --> 02:37:28.046]  I'm not sure.
[02:37:28.106 --> 02:37:28.927]  I'm going from memory.
[02:37:28.987 --> 02:37:29.827]  I think that's it.
[02:37:29.847 --> 02:37:30.128]  888-6GUNS.
[02:37:31.089 --> 02:37:34.052]  Well, any advice you've got in closing for Danny?
[02:37:35.131 --> 02:37:37.433]  Riley, who they're trying to turn into their minion.
[02:37:37.653 --> 02:37:40.996]  They did that with you, too, and you refused, and they did do what they promised.
[02:37:41.016 --> 02:37:43.318]  They came out there and guns your people down.
[02:37:44.879 --> 02:37:54.187]  Yes, well, just to stay firm and try to draw some courage up from deep down inside and stand for what's right.
[02:37:54.887 --> 02:37:58.931]  That's what everybody in this country is going to have to do if they don't want to be in total enslavement.
[02:38:00.152 --> 02:38:00.332]  Yep.
[02:38:01.072 --> 02:38:01.853]  Liberty and for sale.
[02:38:03.812 --> 02:38:09.041]  Well, my gosh, I mean, in closing, I want you both to comment on this, and we're all going to pray for you, Danny Reilly.
[02:38:09.061 --> 02:38:10.002]  I think you're going to be fine.
[02:38:10.022 --> 02:38:10.784]  You haven't done anything wrong.
[02:38:10.804 --> 02:38:11.705]  You need to just remember that.
[02:38:12.747 --> 02:38:17.915]  They've tried to now get you to do criminal things for them, you know, so they should just leave you alone.
[02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:26.487]  But the point here is, for those that just joined us, up on PrisonPlanet.com, on the right-hand side, there's a story so huge, it's mind-blowing.
[02:38:26.787 --> 02:38:27.268]  The U.S.
[02:38:27.308 --> 02:38:41.240]  military is actively lobbying the government, with our taxpayer money, to end the borders and legalize 30 million illegals, and it legalizes aggravated child molesters, aggravated rapists, aggravated robbers.
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:43.062]  I mean, this is violent felons.
[02:38:43.662 --> 02:38:50.505]  To be part of the military, and they're telling Congress that this is patriotic, because they need these illegals to join the military.
[02:38:50.525 --> 02:38:56.768]  I mean, my God, if that isn't treason by our military, at the highest levels, trying to kill America.
[02:38:57.949 --> 02:38:59.510]  How can the FBI not wake up?
[02:38:59.550 --> 02:39:00.910]  How can the police not wake up?
[02:39:01.251 --> 02:39:03.031]  How can you spin that in your brains?
[02:39:03.932 --> 02:39:07.493]  Randy Weaver, I mean, you were a Green Beret, you know, fought for this country.
[02:39:07.534 --> 02:39:10.095]  I mean, what is it like to just see it get this bad?
[02:39:10.135 --> 02:39:12.636]  Everything the old-timers told us is happening.
[02:39:13.251 --> 02:39:14.351]  I mean, it's all happening.
[02:39:15.292 --> 02:39:24.175]  Yeah, it's hard for me to believe sometimes, Alex, but it's... I don't know how they're brainwashed, these people.
[02:39:25.835 --> 02:39:27.436]  Actually, I go back.
[02:39:27.556 --> 02:39:29.496]  I think what it is is strictly mercenaries.
[02:39:29.556 --> 02:39:31.097]  Mercenaries don't do anything for a dollar.
[02:39:31.917 --> 02:39:35.998]  I saw an interview guy on National Network this morning.
[02:39:36.579 --> 02:39:37.559]  He's a Navy SEAL.
[02:39:38.459 --> 02:39:41.581]  And, uh, telling the story they were doing over there in Afghanistan.
[02:39:41.601 --> 02:39:47.185]  This guy was totally wrong in what, uh, he said that they should have done.
[02:39:47.205 --> 02:39:50.007]  And he's feeling bad because he didn't do it at the time.
[02:39:50.027 --> 02:39:57.491]  Uh, just to shoot a couple of goat herders so that they wouldn't get snitched on for the fact, you know, that it wouldn't blow the cover.
[02:39:58.412 --> 02:39:59.953]  And that the fact they were in the area.
[02:40:00.513 --> 02:40:01.994]  I mean, that's the thing.
[02:40:02.675 --> 02:40:06.037]  I'll never forget this, uh, private Gruckheimer.
[02:40:07.383 --> 02:40:17.791]  In 2002, it was in the Ithaca Journal, and I'll never forget, he was bragging, he said, we go into villages and we kill every woman and every child in Afghanistan, in these sectors.
[02:40:19.012 --> 02:40:23.575]  And then the Pentagon went on Fox News and said, well, let us clarify, we do in certain areas kill everyone.
[02:40:24.179 --> 02:40:34.927]  I mean, my God, folks, when they're on the news saying we killed the babies, and then, yeah, I saw a text report about that where, well, I made a mistake not killing some goat people.
[02:40:35.067 --> 02:40:39.750]  I mean, you know, my God, folks, when you just start... Do you think our country's safe?
[02:40:39.770 --> 02:40:41.711]  Do you think your children are safe?
[02:40:41.912 --> 02:40:44.653]  When the number one TV show, they torture people every episode?
[02:40:44.673 --> 02:40:47.636]  I mean, they're doing this to sell us on evil.
[02:40:47.696 --> 02:40:48.176]  This is being...
[02:40:49.053 --> 02:40:50.154]  God help us, Randy.
[02:40:50.635 --> 02:40:56.760]  Don't they understand that freedom breeds a place where you can own your home and own your business and safety and have a life?
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:40:58.882]  Freedom isn't just some sappy thing.
[02:40:58.942 --> 02:41:00.263]  It's about living your life!
[02:41:00.583 --> 02:41:04.427]  When you let the evil in, folks, things get bad real fast!
[02:41:06.388 --> 02:41:08.290]  We're losing the country quick.
[02:41:08.350 --> 02:41:11.373]  People better keep their powder dry and get ready to use it.
[02:41:12.102 --> 02:41:12.822]  Well, there's no doubt.
[02:41:12.862 --> 02:41:15.383]  I mean, Ron Paul said it in his 30 years of fighting this thing.
[02:41:15.423 --> 02:41:19.824]  He said, the life and death struggle, I mean, mortal combat.
[02:41:20.344 --> 02:41:21.984]  Folks, I mean, the U.S.
[02:41:22.064 --> 02:41:22.724]  is in a fight.
[02:41:23.084 --> 02:41:24.004]  It has no armor.
[02:41:24.065 --> 02:41:25.025]  It's got a short sword.
[02:41:25.065 --> 02:41:32.546]  The enemy's got a big old trident and a shield and has already stabbed us quite a few times, but America's still strong.
[02:41:32.886 --> 02:41:35.787]  We're bleeding bad, but if we really get in there and get fired up,
[02:41:36.327 --> 02:41:37.468]  Well, you're right on target, Alex.
[02:42:05.455 --> 02:42:23.848]  I'm just hoping that enough people in the area out there, from all over the country, whatever they can get there, will go out there and just stand at the end of their driveway, if nothing else, and let them really suited monsters out there in the woods know that Ed and Elaine got some backup.
[02:42:24.588 --> 02:42:30.773]  Now you've been around these guys, you faced down Horiyuchi in trial, and he was all pleasurably talking about killing your wife and how he'd do it again.
[02:42:31.053 --> 02:42:33.214]  Do you think, Randy, they just flat out enjoy it?
[02:42:33.534 --> 02:42:34.175]  I mean, what is it?
[02:42:35.147 --> 02:42:41.470]  Uh, well, Haruki admitted in court, uh, Gary Spence asked him if he enjoyed doing his job, and he said yes.
[02:42:43.430 --> 02:42:43.670]  Yeah.
[02:42:46.271 --> 02:42:50.893]  You know, I mean, I can see enjoying some bully starting a fight with you and hitting you first, and then you beat him.
[02:42:50.913 --> 02:42:56.155]  I mean, that's a normal enjoyment of doing the right thing, but I don't understand getting off on killing children and women.
[02:42:56.835 --> 02:42:59.757]  Well, I've always been against snipers.
[02:43:00.017 --> 02:43:02.358]  I think snipers haven't got any courage either.
[02:43:02.938 --> 02:43:03.418]  I was always
[02:43:03.797 --> 02:43:05.017]  I heard you guys saying that earlier.
[02:43:05.298 --> 02:43:06.138]  Well I didn't hear that.
[02:43:25.870 --> 02:43:28.091]  Oh yes, you didn't know about that?
[02:43:28.151 --> 02:43:35.152]  He just, he walked up to the front gate and they yelled freeze, he turned around and they just shot twice at him and then jumped up in front of him and tasered him.
[02:43:37.293 --> 02:43:38.973]  Their story is they didn't shoot at me, right?
[02:43:39.033 --> 02:43:39.834]  That's what I've been hearing.
[02:43:40.614 --> 02:43:41.574]  I know what I feel, you know.
[02:43:41.634 --> 02:43:45.395]  Well, they tried to keep the first person they killed secret, didn't they, Randy?
[02:43:47.156 --> 02:43:48.016]  The first person?
[02:43:48.976 --> 02:43:52.957]  I mean, going back from memory to Ruby Ridge, didn't they try to keep somebody's murder quiet?
[02:43:53.818 --> 02:43:56.520]  Oh yeah, they never did admit that they knew Sam was dead.
[02:43:56.540 --> 02:43:59.322]  They shot him right within 40 or 50 feet of him.
[02:44:00.142 --> 02:44:04.385]  He laid there right in the road and Vicky and I went down and picked him up off the road shortly thereafter.
[02:44:05.165 --> 02:44:09.728]  We sat there holding, I was holding him in my arms for a couple minutes just screaming and cussing.
[02:44:10.348 --> 02:44:11.509]  And they were sitting there watching us.
[02:44:11.549 --> 02:44:12.850]  We didn't realize they were still there.
[02:44:12.870 --> 02:44:16.152]  Yeah, they had more fun later.
[02:44:16.352 --> 02:44:18.153]  They wanted to do the laboratory first.
[02:44:18.173 --> 02:44:19.214]  They could have got you right there.
[02:44:19.614 --> 02:44:20.875]  I think that they were totally
[02:44:22.052 --> 02:44:26.136]  Uh, they didn't know what to think because they shot their own man, the U.S.
[02:44:26.216 --> 02:44:27.977]  Marshal, and shot the kid.
[02:44:27.997 --> 02:44:30.499]  They had strict orders not to mess with my kids or my wife.
[02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:31.780]  What'd they do?
[02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:33.281]  They ended up killing the kids and the wife.
[02:44:34.522 --> 02:44:35.483]  Or my son.
[02:44:35.503 --> 02:44:46.632]  And, uh, at that very moment, though, after they shot their own man, it was such a screw-up on their part that they just, they were flabbergasted.
[02:44:47.469 --> 02:44:52.553]  And I think if we'd have gone down an hour later to get Sam, they'd have figured out they had to kill us, too.
[02:44:54.895 --> 02:44:55.655]  Ah, Jesus.
[02:44:57.477 --> 02:45:00.139]  Does anybody think they're safe when the government's this bad?
[02:45:00.519 --> 02:45:02.561]  It's the government that always abuses people.
[02:45:02.621 --> 02:45:15.471]  It's the biggest, baddest thing, and now it's out of control, and all these fools are empowering it, and now I don't think they can get... I've been talking to a lot of sources, enough evil FBI, enough bad federal marshals, enough evil people,
[02:45:16.389 --> 02:45:18.650]  And so that's why they're going to bring in the foreigners to do it, Randy?
[02:45:19.410 --> 02:45:19.750]  Yes.
[02:45:20.510 --> 02:45:22.211]  I think that's probably right.
[02:45:22.691 --> 02:45:24.231]  We're in a lot of trouble, folks.
[02:45:24.871 --> 02:45:27.172]  God isn't going to let us get away with 50 million abortions.
[02:45:28.852 --> 02:45:30.413]  The universe isn't going to let us get away with it.
[02:45:30.433 --> 02:45:33.574]  Well, Randy Weaver and Danny Riley, we're going to get a big write-up on this.
[02:45:33.714 --> 02:45:34.534]  Randy, I'll talk to you later.
[02:45:34.554 --> 02:45:36.655]  Are you going to be there in about an hour?
[02:45:36.675 --> 02:45:38.275]  Yeah, I have to run to town.
[02:45:38.315 --> 02:45:40.176]  I've got a whole bunch of errands to run.
[02:45:40.196 --> 02:45:41.336]  I've been on the phone for two days.
[02:45:42.382 --> 02:45:43.462]  Uh, I'll have my cell phone.
[02:45:43.682 --> 02:45:45.003]  That's this number you called.
[02:45:45.023 --> 02:45:46.263]  Okay, well I'm going to call you, sir.
[02:45:46.283 --> 02:45:46.803]  God bless you.
[02:45:47.164 --> 02:45:47.944]  Okay, same to you.
[02:45:47.964 --> 02:45:48.324]  Thank you.
[02:45:48.344 --> 02:45:48.424]  Bye.
[02:45:48.584 --> 02:45:49.324]  Thank you, Randy.
[02:45:49.364 --> 02:45:50.004]  Thank you, Danny.
[02:45:50.044 --> 02:45:51.665]  Okay, Danny, you stay in contact with us.
[02:45:51.685 --> 02:45:54.266]  Should I get my lawyer's phone number out in the air?
[02:45:55.106 --> 02:45:56.667]  No, he'll get bombarded with people.
[02:45:57.167 --> 02:45:57.567]  Alright.
[02:45:57.907 --> 02:45:59.567]  Just, uh, I'll talk to you during the break.
[02:45:59.607 --> 02:46:00.248]  Hold on one moment.
[02:46:00.548 --> 02:46:02.828]  I've had this guy holding for 20 minutes and I appreciate it.
[02:46:03.769 --> 02:46:07.890]  Motion to dismiss the state of Florida versus Kevin Wood case, ACLU.
[02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:10.631]  He has beaten us in the past.
[02:46:11.648 --> 02:46:16.309]  We talked about the article where the cops were yelling at these people in a car, so they started videotaping.
[02:46:16.749 --> 02:46:20.130]  The cops arrested them and then laughed and said, look, we're videotaping and recording you.
[02:46:20.610 --> 02:46:21.370]  We're exempt.
[02:46:22.071 --> 02:46:26.972]  Wiretapping is if you plant something in somebody's house or record something secretly that's in a private setting.
[02:46:28.312 --> 02:46:40.775]  If there is no presumption of privacy, if there's no expectation of privacy, and this is well known at a football stadium or on the road or in somebody else's car,
[02:46:41.531 --> 02:46:42.733]  You can videotape these cops.
[02:46:42.853 --> 02:46:44.935]  They're counting on you dumb and then plea bargaining.
[02:46:46.157 --> 02:46:50.342]  And I'm trying to call to get the 18-year-old man on who's facing seven years in prison.
[02:46:50.963 --> 02:46:53.466]  They're throwing him, and this district attorney stands behind it.
[02:46:54.187 --> 02:46:57.852]  This happened in the Patriot News reported, once Patriot Pennsylvania.
[02:46:59.412 --> 02:47:03.355]  And it was in Pennsylvania where somebody yelled at a police dog.
[02:47:03.395 --> 02:47:09.659]  He was walking through a parking lot, a grocery store parking lot, and the window was down and the German Shepherd lunged out and almost bit him.
[02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:11.621]  And the guy just yelled in fear.
[02:47:11.981 --> 02:47:13.902]  The cop said, you just yelled at an officer.
[02:47:14.323 --> 02:47:15.744]  He served two years in prison.
[02:47:16.264 --> 02:47:19.026]  Talking to their dogs is bad now.
[02:47:19.753 --> 02:47:24.596]  You don't talk back to their dogs, and you don't videotape them while they put cameras up everywhere on you.
[02:47:25.176 --> 02:47:26.157]  You dumb police!
[02:47:26.177 --> 02:47:28.538]  You think you're going to have any freedom acting and living like this?
[02:47:29.839 --> 02:47:30.519]  God help you!
[02:47:31.639 --> 02:47:32.860]  Let's go ahead and go to Mr. Wood.
[02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:33.480]  We're about to break.
[02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:34.661]  We'll have the final segment with him.
[02:47:35.041 --> 02:47:37.503]  Mr. Wood, you've seen us before, haven't you?
[02:47:38.183 --> 02:47:39.484]  Oh, I've been there, done that.
[02:47:40.884 --> 02:47:41.825]  What did they try with you?
[02:47:41.865 --> 02:47:42.425]  What happened with you?
[02:47:44.073 --> 02:47:46.235]  For the last decade I've been fighting this issue.
[02:47:46.855 --> 02:47:54.881]  I had a situation where I recorded the cops where they wanted to interview my minor daughter that I had custody of in a McDonald's restaurant.
[02:47:54.941 --> 02:47:59.144]  I met in McDonald's so we could at least have some place of safety for the interview to occur.
[02:47:59.764 --> 02:48:07.830]  Put my tape recorder on the table and finally a sergeant comes in and during the interview says turn the tape off and I say no.
[02:48:08.390 --> 02:48:10.912]  I'm arrested and taken to jail in front of my minor daughter.
[02:48:11.516 --> 02:48:16.178]  But later on, the state dropped the charges because it is not illegal to record the cops.
[02:48:16.519 --> 02:48:17.679]  Well, that's what they say though.
[02:48:17.699 --> 02:48:21.801]  They go, we're allowed to have cameras, but you're not, because we say so.
[02:48:21.821 --> 02:48:23.822]  Because we work for the foreign banks.
[02:48:24.363 --> 02:48:27.845]  Yeah, it's a matter of due process and equal protection.
[02:48:29.325 --> 02:48:29.926]  Well, listen.
[02:48:30.086 --> 02:48:31.606]  I mean, I got news for the cops.
[02:48:31.667 --> 02:48:32.447]  I carry a camera.
[02:48:32.787 --> 02:48:33.988]  I'll be out driving around today.
[02:48:34.008 --> 02:48:36.229]  You want to get into a lawsuit, just pull me over.
[02:48:37.490 --> 02:48:38.250]  Just come up.
[02:48:39.395 --> 02:48:39.935]  Just come on!
[02:48:40.035 --> 02:48:42.736]  You already told me I couldn't condemn the First Amendment last week here in Austin.
[02:48:43.256 --> 02:48:45.097]  And I told you, scum, get out of my face!
[02:48:45.117 --> 02:48:52.459]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.799 --> 02:48:54.740]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:55.100 --> 02:49:02.702]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.433 --> 02:49:10.497]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.897 --> 02:49:22.323]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.623 --> 02:49:26.125]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.606 --> 02:49:28.527]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.847 --> 02:49:32.709]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:48.783 --> 02:51:54.806]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:55.406 --> 02:51:58.388]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:59.188 --> 02:52:03.251]  Listen, it isn't that I can't personally have men in uniforms come out and boss me around.
[02:52:03.271 --> 02:52:06.172]  I know it's America dying when that happens.
[02:52:06.953 --> 02:52:08.454]  I mean, we're out there on the sidewalk.
[02:52:08.494 --> 02:52:09.754]  We're Bullhorn and Rick Perry.
[02:52:10.415 --> 02:52:11.815]  And here come a bunch of Austin cops.
[02:52:11.836 --> 02:52:12.736]  State police know better.
[02:52:12.776 --> 02:52:14.297]  They've once lost so many lawsuits.
[02:52:15.163 --> 02:52:17.124]  And they just said, you need to go, you're all going to be arrested.
[02:52:17.144 --> 02:52:18.224]  And I said, but it's the First Amendment.
[02:52:18.284 --> 02:52:19.825]  And he goes, this is an unauthorized protest.
[02:52:19.865 --> 02:52:22.426]  I said, well that's been tried out in the courts, you know it.
[02:52:23.146 --> 02:52:26.747]  And then he went and lied to the media and said, I'm not saying I'm going to arrest him, he's a liar.
[02:52:27.207 --> 02:52:31.349]  Not only do you lie, but then you call me a liar!
[02:52:32.349 --> 02:52:35.451]  And I went up and I said, you're a degenerate piece of scum!
[02:52:37.371 --> 02:52:40.612]  And then they started admitting on tape, alright, we're arresting all of you.
[02:52:40.832 --> 02:52:44.794]  They had their riot cops ready and I said, go ahead, bring it on, I'm going to sue all of you.
[02:52:45.464 --> 02:52:48.586]  And you'll probably beat it in court with your corrupt system, but you're going to have to pay for lawyers.
[02:52:49.107 --> 02:52:51.729]  And they got so mad, literally turned Reverend, just ARGH!
[02:52:52.870 --> 02:52:56.052]  And then a few cops showed up and spoke some sense into them, too.
[02:52:57.973 --> 02:53:00.015]  But let me tell you, those cops won't be there soon, folks.
[02:53:00.075 --> 02:53:01.296]  It'll be foreigners.
[02:53:02.477 --> 02:53:03.918]  And I'm not kidding, that's in the news now.
[02:53:05.059 --> 02:53:07.060]  This country has gone to hell in a handbasket.
[02:53:07.140 --> 02:53:12.084]  I mean, I treated you with respect until you tried to kill my country.
[02:53:12.967 --> 02:53:22.912]  And let me tell you something, all over the nation, every day I see articles where there was one cop kept speeding up and down the road so they put a camera out there and the cops arrested him, but then that got dropped.
[02:53:23.112 --> 02:53:30.215]  You want to put cameras on us, cameras in the school bathrooms, you got microphones on recording us, you don't, but then, and you're pulling us over.
[02:53:30.355 --> 02:53:33.477]  You're in our car and you don't want us to videotape you, you criminal.
[02:53:33.777 --> 02:53:34.117]  Now sir,
[02:53:35.555 --> 02:53:36.915]  You really are an expert on this case.
[02:53:36.975 --> 02:53:43.877]  Any other points that Steve Watson should add to the great article he's written about this man facing seven years sentence under wiretapping law for filming police?
[02:53:44.377 --> 02:53:45.398]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:53:47.458 --> 02:53:48.138]  Oh, you're talking to me?
[02:53:48.298 --> 02:53:48.959]  Yes, Kevin Wood.
[02:53:49.059 --> 02:53:49.939]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:53:50.039 --> 02:53:54.120]  I mean, Brian Kelly, he did what any other reasonable citizen would do.
[02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:56.981]  He wanted a record of his communications with police officers.
[02:53:58.741 --> 02:54:04.783]  And we need to find a courageous attorney out there somewhere in this country that'll take this into federal court
[02:54:05.316 --> 02:54:12.223]  and challenge the interception and recording laws under due process and equal protection grounds.
[02:54:12.723 --> 02:54:16.367]  We need to get the federal courts and the Supreme Court to rule on this issue.
[02:54:17.020 --> 02:54:20.583]  But there are a lot of other rulings in the past, and state rulings.
[02:54:20.643 --> 02:54:26.006]  I mean, if you're at a sports stadium, and you're videotaping the police, they can't run up and arrest you saying you're wiretapping.
[02:54:26.927 --> 02:54:33.011]  In fact, the cop in the article is going, well I've arrested somebody for recording his girlfriend in her house before.
[02:54:33.152 --> 02:54:34.893]  That's sneaking in and planting something.
[02:54:34.913 --> 02:54:35.873]  Yeah, that's a felony.
[02:54:36.274 --> 02:54:36.854]  Absolutely.
[02:54:36.894 --> 02:54:43.679]  But I mean, being in your car, and the cop pulls you over to raise some money, and he's got cameras all over him, but you're not supposed to videotape him?
[02:54:43.919 --> 02:54:44.900]  You people are nuts!
[02:54:45.320 --> 02:54:47.761]  Well, it's a denial of due process and equal protection.
[02:54:47.801 --> 02:54:52.782]  We should have the equal right to record the police or government officials as they have the right to record us.
[02:54:52.842 --> 02:54:56.063]  I've had them walk up to me before and say, turn it off or I'll arrest you for wiretapping.
[02:54:56.103 --> 02:54:57.163]  And I go, go ahead, criminal.
[02:54:57.684 --> 02:54:59.524]  I call them criminals, too, because they are criminals.
[02:54:59.844 --> 02:55:05.266]  Yeah, before the commercial, I said, you know, these people wanted to interview my minor daughter in a McDonald's restaurant.
[02:55:05.886 --> 02:55:07.146]  And I wanted to record it at.
[02:55:07.166 --> 02:55:07.286]  Why?
[02:55:07.846 --> 02:55:08.166]  Do what?
[02:55:08.446 --> 02:55:08.767]  Why?
[02:55:09.267 --> 02:55:13.668]  Because my daughter had a boyfriend who was involved in a car accident, and she was
[02:55:14.096 --> 02:55:16.518]  Kind of covering up for him, but they wanted to interview her.
[02:55:17.038 --> 02:55:18.119]  And I said, hey, that's fine.
[02:55:18.139 --> 02:55:20.921]  And so as a father, you said, I'll let you meet, which you shouldn't even have done.
[02:55:20.941 --> 02:55:21.501]  You just left.
[02:55:22.081 --> 02:55:23.442]  And I'll record.
[02:55:23.462 --> 02:55:25.304]  And they said, no, we rule America, scum.
[02:55:25.644 --> 02:55:28.025]  Yeah, the sergeant walks in and says, turn off the tape recorder.
[02:55:28.085 --> 02:55:28.906]  I said, hell no.
[02:55:29.286 --> 02:55:30.967]  I was arrested and taken to jail.
[02:55:31.188 --> 02:55:34.530]  But the charges were later dropped because it is not illegal to do so.
[02:55:35.786 --> 02:55:37.287]  Did you get him for false imprisonment?
[02:55:37.767 --> 02:55:38.348]  No, no.
[02:55:38.828 --> 02:55:40.769]  It's hard to do that because... No, no.
[02:55:40.809 --> 02:55:41.469]  They say that.
[02:55:41.829 --> 02:55:43.650]  You've got to sue them in their private capacity.
[02:55:44.131 --> 02:55:48.873]  In their private capacity and also you have to overcome a thing called judicial immunity.
[02:55:49.294 --> 02:55:51.155]  That's not real.
[02:55:51.475 --> 02:55:52.856]  Anybody that acts like that is a crook.
[02:55:53.256 --> 02:55:55.877]  You just start following them around with video cameras and put a P.I.
[02:55:55.977 --> 02:55:56.157]  on them.
[02:55:56.377 --> 02:55:57.858]  Then you deliver the photos to their wife.
[02:55:58.078 --> 02:55:59.479]  That's how you play hardball.
[02:55:59.959 --> 02:56:00.820]  You know what?
[02:56:00.840 --> 02:56:01.360]  I'll tell you what.
[02:56:01.380 --> 02:56:01.620]  Stay there.
[02:56:03.749 --> 02:56:05.110]  Because I want to talk to you after the break, sir.
[02:56:05.130 --> 02:56:06.851]  I want to get you up for a full 30 minutes tomorrow.
[02:56:07.191 --> 02:56:08.552]  I apologize for cutting you short.
[02:56:08.592 --> 02:56:09.373]  Okay, Mr. Wood?
[02:56:09.713 --> 02:56:10.694]  Uh-huh.
[02:56:10.794 --> 02:56:12.114]  Uh, you're game to come back on tomorrow?
[02:56:13.235 --> 02:56:14.336]  I'll... you tell me when.
[02:56:14.516 --> 02:56:15.136]  Fantastic.
[02:56:15.196 --> 02:56:15.497]  All right.
[02:56:15.517 --> 02:56:17.238]  Yeah, he's been involved in some big cases.
[02:56:17.918 --> 02:56:19.659]  Seriously, just stop pushing us around.
[02:56:19.699 --> 02:56:20.580]  I'm not your slave.
[02:56:20.820 --> 02:56:21.781]  Get off my back.
[02:56:22.021 --> 02:56:22.601]  You got it?
[02:56:22.961 --> 02:56:24.022]  God bless you all.
