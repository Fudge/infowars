[00:00:05.728 --> 00:00:06.368]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:08.089]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:09.910]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.370]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.111]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:17.632]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:21.993]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:25.434]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:26.114]  Welcome.
[00:00:26.274 --> 00:00:27.775]  It is Monday.
[00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:33.072]  March 19, 2007.
[00:00:34.312 --> 00:00:38.995]  I was going to say, you know, I do a Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:41.276]  Central, live every Sunday.
[00:00:41.316 --> 00:00:43.437]  So really, Sunday is like my Monday.
[00:00:44.218 --> 00:00:45.459]  I just take off Saturdays.
[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.561]  But I was about to make the point that it really doesn't matter.
[00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:51.282]  You don't tune in to hear about my life.
[00:00:52.337 --> 00:00:56.461]  I certainly don't get up here on the air to talk about my life, so that was the pregnant pause there.
[00:00:57.021 --> 00:01:05.628]  Coming up in the third hour, we're scheduled to have Stephen Marshall, the founder and the head honcho of Guerrilla News Network, on.
[00:01:06.228 --> 00:01:15.176]  He made an excellent 9-11 film that we carry in the InfoWars video bookstore online, Aftermath, Unanswered Questions from 9-11.
[00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:20.300]  Prolific filmmaker joining us coming up.
[00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:23.243]  for part of the third hour.
[00:01:23.403 --> 00:01:48.037]  Mark Gregory Kornkein, just an amazing American and one of the main engines behind the explosion of the militia movement in this country back in the 1990s, who was set up on charges, and I have the police squad car video, they set him up and sent to prison for seven years, much of it in maximum security.
[00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:50.652]  For a police car ramming his car.
[00:01:51.072 --> 00:01:53.813]  He had his children with him.
[00:01:53.853 --> 00:01:55.913]  He was trying to get them to a safe place, a public place.
[00:01:55.953 --> 00:01:56.853]  He knew it was a set up.
[00:01:56.873 --> 00:02:05.376]  It turned out to be that one of the police cars rammed him and so he went to prison for seven years and then again spent much of it in maximum security.
[00:02:06.996 --> 00:02:08.737]  Talk about a strong person.
[00:02:08.857 --> 00:02:11.278]  I talked to him for an hour and a half Saturday night.
[00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:14.959]  I played phone tag with he and his wife and family.
[00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:16.489]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:46.153]  And to get to talk to Mark, and he took seven years in prison, has great training, and says he wrote, I think, three books while he was in there, and one of them is about to be published.
[00:02:46.213 --> 00:02:48.514]  I hope to get a copy of it and carry it here.
[00:02:48.554 --> 00:02:49.855]  It's, I think, Battle for the Republic.
[00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:53.137]  He'd been talking about that before he was sent off to the Gulag.
[00:02:53.617 --> 00:02:57.900]  And this book was written, at least three books, were written behind the wire.
[00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:05.549]  And so he is scheduled to join us coming up in the second hour.
[00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.874]  I want to talk to Stephen Marshall, but I don't know if an hour is going to be enough with Mark Corenkey.
[00:03:12.894 --> 00:03:15.696]  Maybe he'll ride shotgun with us when Stephen Marshall joins us.
[00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:20.319]  Because Stephen Marshall was set up a few weeks ago.
[00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:24.342]  I mean, 45 minutes of air time, 45 minutes of talk time in an hour.
[00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.693]  We have a light commercial load compared to most talk shows, but that's still quite a few.
[00:03:30.713 --> 00:03:33.435]  It's just not enough time to talk to him.
[00:03:33.575 --> 00:03:33.955]  Okay.
[00:03:35.376 --> 00:03:37.197]  Big news across the spectrum.
[00:03:38.758 --> 00:03:48.786]  Today, new Khalid Sheikh Mohammed news as the entire public, I mean it's like 97% in polls now, thinking it's a complete fraud and a lie.
[00:03:48.826 --> 00:03:52.188]  Day one, 74% thought so in a CNN poll.
[00:03:52.228 --> 00:03:52.969]  Now it's in the mid-90s.
[00:03:54.813 --> 00:03:59.977]  Depending on which poll you look at, this has completely backfired, blown up in the Pentagon's face.
[00:04:00.498 --> 00:04:03.500]  We said that last Thursday.
[00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:12.708]  Now the mainstream news is using terms like blew up in face, backfired, completely, utterly, and totally.
[00:04:12.808 --> 00:04:20.674]  I was on a neoconservant show, Man Cow this morning, Man Joe Mueller, and he was even saying it was totally fake.
[00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:24.117]  Of course, he had me on about Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.467]  And that leads me to one of our top stories I will cover first today.
[00:04:30.948 --> 00:04:37.611]  Last Tuesday, I was emailed... Well, I'll tell ya... I'll tell ya the details on the other side.
[00:04:38.751 --> 00:04:41.492]  And I'm really ashamed of 9-11 Truth right now.
[00:04:41.512 --> 00:04:45.374]  Don't think I've ever really talked like that, but I am right now.
[00:04:46.895 --> 00:04:52.177]  And, uh, I mean, I expected this from the mainstream media, but I'm just really ashamed of, uh...
[00:04:54.312 --> 00:04:58.855]  of just the alternative press on this, you have dropped the ball miserably!
[00:04:58.875 --> 00:05:10.021]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.402 --> 00:05:18.026]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.726 --> 00:05:25.790]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:37.616]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.916 --> 00:05:41.498]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:43.820]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.922]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:07.203]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.209 --> 00:08:18.091]  Alright, let me make it clear here.
[00:08:18.855 --> 00:08:20.817]  I'm not a fan of Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:08:21.858 --> 00:08:27.662]  In fact, I've now learned that she does tune into the radio program.
[00:08:27.702 --> 00:08:28.263]  She's heard it.
[00:08:29.284 --> 00:08:31.045]  She is aware of the news we cover.
[00:08:31.065 --> 00:08:39.352]  I have talked to some of her friends and she's been aware of the New World Order the last couple years.
[00:08:39.792 --> 00:08:46.118]  And I'm not a fan of the big liberal Rosie O'Donnell who was for basically gun bans and
[00:08:47.506 --> 00:08:49.848]  Having Kmart and others shut down gun sales.
[00:08:51.289 --> 00:08:53.911]  But that was a Rosie O'Donnell of 7, 8, 9 years ago.
[00:08:54.031 --> 00:08:55.012]  People change.
[00:08:57.254 --> 00:09:02.578]  And she's used every opportunity the last month to go on and just start saying 9-11's an inside job.
[00:09:02.598 --> 00:09:10.864]  9-11's an inside job when she's talking about John Connor, a host here on Genesis, whose own
[00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:26.758]  ...website is extremely conservative, and then she showed great knowledge of the site and said he's a non-conformist, and then I later learned behind the scenes that, indeed, Rosie O'Donnell visits his site, my site, other sites, and reads all the stuff we're saying, and it's okay with her.
[00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:27.960]  Conservative!
[00:09:29.855 --> 00:09:31.917]  Because it's not fake conservative, you see.
[00:09:32.177 --> 00:09:53.455]  People like O'Donnell get more entrenched into fake liberalism because they look at the system telling us that a George Bush Senior or a George Bush Junior is good and anti-corruption and pro-America, and anybody with half a brain knows that's a fraud, so they get caught up in the false left-right paradigm and then run back to the left and get more entrenched in it.
[00:09:54.838 --> 00:10:00.339]  That's why, by being honest here, we're able to wake liberals up all day that, well, why should you not have guns?
[00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:04.780]  If you have a corrupt state and a dangerous government, that's an insurance policy for defense.
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.161]  Isn't it okay for a Native American to have a Winchester to defend themselves?
[00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:12.401]  Oh, yes, they were under oppression.
[00:10:13.001 --> 00:10:17.162]  Well, is it okay for some black African fighting oppressors to have a gun?
[00:10:17.342 --> 00:10:17.942]  Oh, yes.
[00:10:18.843 --> 00:10:20.983]  But it's not okay for you to.
[00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.890]  Don't you see?
[00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.591]  And they go, oh, I see.
[00:10:24.911 --> 00:10:32.712]  You get outside the staid, controlled debates that they set out for us to follow.
[00:10:34.933 --> 00:10:48.496]  The New World Order basically lays out three or four different outfits, different costumes, different genres, different, oh, what's the word, different suits we can put on.
[00:10:51.005 --> 00:10:52.867]  But it isn't individualistic.
[00:10:52.907 --> 00:10:54.709]  It isn't what really springs from the people.
[00:10:55.229 --> 00:10:59.233]  It's what Madison Avenue and the big PR firms have put out.
[00:10:59.313 --> 00:11:02.116]  And I just say, say no to their false choices.
[00:11:02.176 --> 00:11:04.919]  But I'm digressing here from the news.
[00:11:06.581 --> 00:11:12.747]  The point is, I've had a chance to be out in Hollywood and meet a lot of really famous people, and I'm not going to name names here, because a lot of them don't want to go public.
[00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:15.681]  But they know all about vaccines.
[00:11:15.701 --> 00:11:17.062]  They know all about the New World Order.
[00:11:17.282 --> 00:11:18.924]  They know all about the North American Union.
[00:11:19.244 --> 00:11:21.466]  They've got safes full of guns.
[00:11:23.188 --> 00:11:25.970]  They are aware of what the government's up to.
[00:11:26.351 --> 00:11:27.552]  They are not liberal.
[00:11:27.852 --> 00:11:29.914]  And they might have been liberal five, ten years ago.
[00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:34.158]  But they're not liberal now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:34.498 --> 00:11:36.820]  By liberal, I mean establishment liberal.
[00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:42.292]  They know the UN's controlled, they know the left's controlled, they now understand.
[00:11:42.312 --> 00:11:45.973]  There's been a paradigm shift, just like there has the general public.
[00:11:46.893 --> 00:11:58.737]  Just ten years ago, if you looked at major polls, one party would be in power, the other party would be out, one party would have 60% approval ratings, the other would have 40% approval ratings, and I'm averaging that.
[00:12:00.498 --> 00:12:03.839]  One might be 57 and the other 43, but it was right around there.
[00:12:04.773 --> 00:12:05.973]  And then they could double-team us.
[00:12:06.053 --> 00:12:17.157]  One party goes in, and everybody wakes up to their corrupt, then they put in new faces from the other party, and then five years, six years, eight years later, you figure out they're corrupt, and now, you know, the other party with new faces is back in.
[00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:27.140]  Folks now, across the board, see that both parties are owned by the same multinational foreign corporations that are nothing more than giant mafia armies.
[00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:32.002]  They're not free market, and they've shifted their understanding.
[00:12:32.646 --> 00:12:37.470]  Cheney with a 12% approval rating, and we've got literally dozens of polls, dozens and dozens on this.
[00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.253]  Congress keeps coming up with 13 to 16% approval ratings.
[00:12:42.134 --> 00:12:44.315]  Most of them come out to 14% approval ratings.
[00:12:44.756 --> 00:12:47.978]  That number comes up over and over again, depending on which poll.
[00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:51.021]  Finally, it's happened, okay?
[00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:53.963]  Everything we've pushed for, we are shattering it.
[00:12:54.824 --> 00:12:56.425]  So let's get past all the labels.
[00:12:57.626 --> 00:13:00.908]  The point is, Rosie O'Donnell has gone public on 9-11 truth.
[00:13:04.309 --> 00:13:07.911]  And the next comment will be, well, so what?
[00:13:07.951 --> 00:13:08.711]  She's a celebrity.
[00:13:08.751 --> 00:13:09.752]  What does her opinion matter?
[00:13:09.992 --> 00:13:15.474]  I mean, even some 9-11 troopers I've talked to have said this, or, well, man, she's not that credible.
[00:13:17.955 --> 00:13:31.642]  What matters is that if Rosie O'Donnell has a crooked toenail, or burps, or, you know, just acts silly, and the Political Correct crowd tries to throttle her down just for talking gibberish,
[00:13:32.338 --> 00:13:34.079]  You know, ching chow, ching chow, whatever.
[00:13:34.719 --> 00:13:35.959]  She wasn't making fun of Asians.
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.840]  They make a huge deal out of it.
[00:13:39.421 --> 00:13:43.702]  Just a massive spectacle is made out of it, and oh my gosh, she's bad.
[00:13:44.422 --> 00:13:46.143]  And I've noticed this the last two months.
[00:13:46.523 --> 00:13:48.404]  The demonization of her has really heated up.
[00:13:48.764 --> 00:13:56.107]  And now I've learned that's because they know she was talking about 9-11 truth behind the scenes at major networks.
[00:13:56.207 --> 00:13:59.388]  She was talking to it in circles in Hollywood and New York.
[00:14:00.894 --> 00:14:05.097]  This was really a preparatory demonization of Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:08.299]  Now, anything she does is international headlines.
[00:14:08.739 --> 00:14:14.883]  One of the biggest news cycle stories, non-stories, was her and Donald Trump fighting with each other, as you know, the last two months.
[00:14:16.444 --> 00:14:22.848]  Rosie O'Donnell stuck her toe in the water last Tuesday, and I got the email from a listener who saw it.
[00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:23.929]  I went to her blog.
[00:14:23.989 --> 00:14:28.592]  Sure enough, she's saying that 9-11 looks like a cover-up, and she doesn't believe the official story.
[00:14:31.062 --> 00:14:44.527]  Then, Friday, she comes out and lists a giant laundry list of Building 7 evidence and how clearly it was blown up, and there were controlled demolitions, and Silverstein says he blew it up, and she gave all these hyperlinks to every statement she made.
[00:14:44.948 --> 00:14:48.209]  Very cogent, very focused, excellent piece.
[00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:56.912]  She spent some time on it, and she told her readers to go research it for themselves and to go check it out.
[00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:05.324]  Within hours of her doing this, Rush Limbaugh just mentioned her.
[00:15:05.904 --> 00:15:07.605]  She wasn't known for 9-11 truth.
[00:15:08.386 --> 00:15:13.269]  Within hours of her posting this, Limbaugh was already aware of it, already saying she's a 9-11 truther.
[00:15:17.711 --> 00:15:22.333]  Now, we have posted, we got a story out Friday and another one out Saturday.
[00:15:22.373 --> 00:15:23.754]  She posted more Saturday.
[00:15:24.374 --> 00:15:26.495]  I thought it would be all over the 9-11 truth sites.
[00:15:27.196 --> 00:15:29.277]  I thought it would be all over the alternative media.
[00:15:29.697 --> 00:15:32.979]  I thought other sites would link to it or at least write their own stories.
[00:15:33.379 --> 00:15:33.839]  They didn't.
[00:15:34.439 --> 00:15:37.681]  They completely and totally ignored it.
[00:15:39.091 --> 00:15:42.373]  On InfoWars.com and on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:15:43.154 --> 00:15:45.735]  And the national media almost completely ignored it.
[00:15:45.836 --> 00:15:47.116]  Man Cow called this morning.
[00:15:47.156 --> 00:15:48.277]  He's on a couple hundred stations.
[00:15:49.398 --> 00:15:51.639]  And he called up and wanted me to come on.
[00:15:51.699 --> 00:15:55.802]  He basically ridiculed me and said, you've got another kook now, Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:15:56.542 --> 00:15:57.763]  And, you know, she's an idiot.
[00:15:58.224 --> 00:16:01.846]  But at least he mentioned that she had gone public.
[00:16:03.627 --> 00:16:06.549]  Now the mainstream media took the bait on Charlie Sheen.
[00:16:08.002 --> 00:16:09.783]  And we talked about it behind the scenes.
[00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:11.184]  You know, what's the attack going to be?
[00:16:11.244 --> 00:16:13.805]  Well, they're probably going to attack you instead of ignoring you.
[00:16:13.825 --> 00:16:18.588]  I told him, thinking that because of a few things in your past, you're going to be weak.
[00:16:19.308 --> 00:16:25.712]  I said, I think the public's going to resonate with your courage, and I think you're going to be extremely popular in this.
[00:16:26.562 --> 00:16:28.743]  Well, my analysis turned out to be correct.
[00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:35.765]  That led to a chain reaction that took 9-11 truth to a whole new level, and then since then it's moved on several more levels.
[00:16:36.145 --> 00:16:39.306]  By the way, Charlie Sheen went public one year ago tomorrow.
[00:16:39.806 --> 00:16:41.086]  It's a historical date.
[00:16:42.606 --> 00:16:44.407]  Because it did lead to a chain reaction.
[00:16:44.427 --> 00:16:47.368]  You never know for sure what will, but I had a feeling there.
[00:16:47.608 --> 00:16:51.409]  Now let me tell you, this Rosie O'Donnell thing could shatter all of that.
[00:16:52.225 --> 00:17:00.556]  I mean, the Sheen thing will be minute, because we're at this next level, several levels above it now, if we can force the mainstream media to cover it.
[00:17:00.797 --> 00:17:04.702]  But despite all of her, quote, baggage, they're not biting.
[00:17:05.102 --> 00:17:06.965]  Not page six of the New York Post.
[00:17:07.971 --> 00:17:16.698]  Which whenever Saul went public on Genesis Communications a month and a half ago, within 24 hours it was front page of the gossip columns all over the country.
[00:17:16.738 --> 00:17:17.859]  Drudge was attacking her.
[00:17:18.159 --> 00:17:19.360]  They were foaming at the mouth.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:20.801]  Not now!
[00:17:21.101 --> 00:17:25.404]  Because O'Donnell is so big, coming off all these other controversies with Trump.
[00:17:25.885 --> 00:17:29.167]  If this breaks, it's going to cause a huge debate about 9-11.
[00:17:29.387 --> 00:17:32.450]  It's going to cause all these liberal and feminist women to look at it.
[00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.031]  And it's over, folks.
[00:17:34.571 --> 00:17:35.072]  It's over.
[00:17:35.432 --> 00:17:40.579]  We are literate, and that's why the mainstream media is dead silent on this.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.201]  They are running silent.
[00:17:42.221 --> 00:17:43.142]  They are running deep.
[00:17:44.139 --> 00:17:48.901]  And we've got to force this out into the mainstream news to cause the giant debate.
[00:17:49.281 --> 00:17:52.202]  And for those that say, well, Rosie O'Donnell isn't the perfect poster child.
[00:17:52.562 --> 00:17:53.303]  It doesn't matter.
[00:17:53.383 --> 00:17:54.063]  It's news.
[00:17:54.243 --> 00:17:54.923]  It's real.
[00:17:55.223 --> 00:17:55.844]  It happened.
[00:17:56.044 --> 00:17:57.224]  She has the courage.
[00:17:57.464 --> 00:17:59.325]  She must be saluted!
[00:17:59.785 --> 00:18:01.926]  She's found out about the New World Order, okay?
[00:18:01.986 --> 00:18:04.087]  I know multiple people that know her.
[00:18:04.367 --> 00:18:06.007]  This is all she talks about now.
[00:18:06.808 --> 00:18:07.228]  Alright?
[00:18:07.968 --> 00:18:09.849]  The New World Order has used her in the past.
[00:18:10.269 --> 00:18:11.530]  I don't think she's an operative.
[00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:12.670]  She's been ignorant.
[00:18:13.524 --> 00:18:19.028]  She's got a lot of courage to go public on Building 7 on her website, thinking she'd get attacked.
[00:18:19.488 --> 00:18:24.292]  She hasn't been, because they know if they take the bait, it's going to blow up in their face.
[00:18:24.692 --> 00:18:33.358]  We've got to force them to take the bait, we've got to force them to cover it, and we've got to force them to swallow this hand grenade, because it's going to blow them sky high.
[00:18:33.698 --> 00:18:34.099]  Okay?
[00:18:34.299 --> 00:18:35.399]  So here it is, folks.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.781]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:38.301 --> 00:18:40.583]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:18:41.083 --> 00:18:42.204]  Go to JonesReport.com.
[00:18:43.946 --> 00:18:51.956]  And get those stories, put them in email, MySpace, message boards, every TV station, radio station, neocon station.
[00:18:53.746 --> 00:18:59.651]  Before they get their talking points, and it looks like they're already getting them, but some of the mid-sized stations don't get talking points.
[00:18:59.971 --> 00:19:02.954]  They just regurgitate what the higher levels say as repeaters.
[00:19:03.214 --> 00:19:05.436]  They don't even know there's a talking point level to this.
[00:19:05.896 --> 00:19:08.598]  So they won't be able to shut their fat mouths.
[00:19:09.038 --> 00:19:11.220]  They're going to go on the attack on O'Donnell.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.321]  She's perfect bait.
[00:19:12.661 --> 00:19:13.842]  She's tailor-made.
[00:19:14.022 --> 00:19:14.823]  What are you talking about?
[00:19:15.023 --> 00:19:17.765]  I've talked to some 9-11 troopers who go, she's not credible, we're not going to cover it.
[00:19:18.006 --> 00:19:18.606]  It's news!
[00:19:18.646 --> 00:19:19.567]  You must cover it!
[00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:20.628]  You fools!
[00:19:20.948 --> 00:19:22.649]  It's perfect that she's got problems!
[00:19:22.869 --> 00:19:23.530]  It's perfect!
[00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:27.132]  It'll blow up ten times bigger!
[00:19:28.213 --> 00:19:31.475]  Don't you understand we're trying to expose the people that carried out 9-11?
[00:19:31.735 --> 00:19:35.178]  If we don't expose the people that carried out 9-11, they're going to keep carrying out attacks?
[00:19:36.319 --> 00:19:37.980]  I don't care how the news gets out!
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.001]  This is God-given!
[00:19:40.622 --> 00:19:42.643]  Thank you, Rosie O'Donnell, for your courage.
[00:19:42.943 --> 00:19:45.905]  She obviously knows with all her baggage she's fair game.
[00:19:46.366 --> 00:19:47.486]  She's got a lot of courage.
[00:19:47.546 --> 00:19:48.207]  It's perfect!
[00:19:49.269 --> 00:19:50.690]  It's absolutely perfect!
[00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:51.891]  Now listen!
[00:19:52.011 --> 00:19:53.191]  Get it out to everybody!
[00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:54.412]  Get it out now!
[00:19:54.752 --> 00:19:58.755]  We'll come back to talk more about this and the latest in Khalid Sheikh Mohammed!
[00:20:01.597 --> 00:20:06.560]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.121]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating.
[00:20:09.181 --> 00:20:12.303]  Our Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:20:12.343 --> 00:20:16.626]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:19.987]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:20:20.287 --> 00:20:23.728]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[00:20:24.048 --> 00:20:33.410]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:37.171]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:20:37.411 --> 00:20:44.513]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[00:20:44.753 --> 00:20:46.134]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.00.

[00:21:00.874 --> 00:21:02.896]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:21:02.996 --> 00:21:03.417]  It's March 19, 2007.
[00:21:03.477 --> 00:21:04.078]  Gold is at $652.40.
[00:21:04.378 --> 00:21:07.822]  And one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $675.65, $334.72 for half, $170.19 for quarter ounce coins at $675.75, $334.72, and $170.19.
[00:21:20.476 --> 00:21:24.118]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[00:21:24.178 --> 00:21:27.179]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:36.424]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[00:21:36.724 --> 00:21:42.067]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[00:21:42.527 --> 00:21:44.849]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[00:21:44.889 --> 00:21:47.351]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[00:21:47.731 --> 00:21:51.014]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:21:51.094 --> 00:21:54.817]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[00:21:54.857 --> 00:21:55.137]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:55.157 --> 00:21:55.337]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:12.551]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:22:13.512 --> 00:22:26.755]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution, your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[00:22:27.535 --> 00:22:32.817]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[00:22:33.726 --> 00:22:40.988]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:41.768 --> 00:22:42.289]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:42.309 --> 00:22:42.629]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:42.649 --> 00:22:44.409]  It's absolutely free.
[00:22:44.429 --> 00:22:48.410]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:49.031]  Just call right now.
[00:23:02.518 --> 00:23:04.560]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:05.181 --> 00:23:14.111]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:14.552 --> 00:23:21.760]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:22.466 --> 00:23:27.968]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:23:28.448 --> 00:23:39.312]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:23:40.032 --> 00:23:42.113]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:23:42.613 --> 00:23:44.034]  For more information, call 702-953-0268.
[00:23:49.804 --> 00:23:50.785]  We're good.
[00:24:24.518 --> 00:24:26.860]  Alright, welcome back.
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:41.131]  Steve Watson has put up another report on InfoWars.net covering the fact that the media hasn't gotten into this.
[00:24:51.494 --> 00:25:07.329]  We need to make the point that Rush Limbaugh knew about it, he mentioned it Friday very briefly, showing that they're on top of this, and we need to lay out also in this article, I think it needs to be added, the reasons why this is so important, what I just laid out earlier.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.302]  O'Donnell comments garner no media coverage.
[00:25:11.342 --> 00:25:13.884]  Talk show host, 9-11 rant ignored.
[00:25:13.984 --> 00:25:24.352]  Monday, March 19, 2007, Rosie O'Donnell's blog comments last week in which she stated some of the facts surrounding the controlled demolition of Building 7 on 9-11 have garnered no media attention.
[00:25:24.392 --> 00:25:29.155]  O'Donnell wrote, the fires in WTC 7 were not evenly distributed, so a perfect collapse was impossible.
[00:25:29.515 --> 00:25:32.898]  Silverstein said to the fire department commander, the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[00:25:33.418 --> 00:25:37.141]  Firefighters withdrawing from the area stated the building was going to blow up.
[00:25:38.064 --> 00:25:43.448]  The roof of the WTC-7 visibly crumpled and the building collapsed perfectly into its own footprint.
[00:25:43.528 --> 00:25:47.351]  Molten steel and partially evaporated steel members were found in the debris.
[00:25:47.871 --> 00:25:56.858]  After going public with the skepticism over the official story on 9-11, O'Donnell then continued to address the issues in a Q&A with her readers on her website.
[00:25:57.398 --> 00:26:05.404]  And she went on with a bunch of responses and saying clearly, you know, that Bush knew when he was at the school and the government stood to gain.
[00:26:05.444 --> 00:26:06.185]  I mean, this is huge.
[00:26:07.586 --> 00:26:18.413]  Despite our efforts to alert readers to this information, the mainstream media has not touched the issue, despite the fact that they seem very willing to hype O'Donnell, respectively, meaningless public tiff with Donald Trump.
[00:26:18.873 --> 00:26:23.776]  A clip from the Rush Limbaugh show last week confirms the media have actively chosen to ignore the story.
[00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:30.194]  Limbaugh typically advocates rehab for 9-11 truthers and refers to O'Donnell under the umbrella.
[00:26:30.735 --> 00:26:38.160]  Clearly the establishment media knows about the story and has chosen the blackout option rather than the discrediting method of debunking.
[00:26:38.781 --> 00:26:50.389]  Charlie Shooting, who went public with his views almost exactly a year ago now, was the first high-profile celebrity to put his reputation on the line in the name of 9-11 truth and garnered major attention from outlets such as CNN at the time.
[00:26:53.246 --> 00:26:54.388]  Let's play Rush Limbaugh.
[00:26:54.408 --> 00:26:57.614]  This is Rush Limbaugh last Friday in his third hour.
[00:26:57.774 --> 00:26:58.656]  Open line Friday.
[00:26:58.716 --> 00:26:59.517]  Here's Rush Limbaugh.
[00:27:07.014 --> 00:27:12.818]  And I personally believe that the government passed these simply because there's overwhelming evidence to indicate that September 11th was an inside job.
[00:27:13.158 --> 00:27:16.240]  Government used explosives to blow up World Trade Center 7 and Twin Towers.
[00:27:37.463 --> 00:27:54.774]  And if you're going to talk about 9-11 being an inside job, and that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, if you're going to start agreeing with Rosie O'Donnell, I would suggest rehab and treatment, counseling and so forth, because unlike Rosie, you've probably got really deep issues from your childhood that need to be resolved.
[00:27:55.574 --> 00:28:00.758]  Because you, sir, are a glittering jewel of colossal ignorance, and I simply am intolerant of it.
[00:28:00.878 --> 00:28:02.739]  I don't care what day of the week.
[00:28:02.819 --> 00:28:04.240]  Montgomery, Alabama, this is Maura.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.701]  Welcome to the show.
[00:28:06.701 --> 00:28:09.762]  This is somebody who has to be literally sedated.
[00:28:10.323 --> 00:28:15.145]  It's a very dangerous form of rehab where they sedate you for two to three days.
[00:28:15.205 --> 00:28:16.526]  You are actually under.
[00:28:16.926 --> 00:28:26.010]  They use one narcotic to literally sedate you because the convulsions are so violent from going off for 100 Oxycontins a day.
[00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:30.492]  This is an individual, I'm not going to get into bashing Rush Limbaugh.
[00:28:30.612 --> 00:28:31.752]  He's really a sad person.
[00:28:32.413 --> 00:28:34.554]  But all the things in his past, the women,
[00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:40.999]  The drug-arrested airports, all of it.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.042]  I don't believe in drug criminalization.
[00:28:44.122 --> 00:28:45.964]  It is a disease, it is an addiction.
[00:28:46.785 --> 00:28:50.529]  That's what's so ridiculous about it, arresting people that are addicted to drugs.
[00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:57.277]  When those drugs were sold out of the backs of trailers by snake oil salesmen, and at every drugstore in this country until the late 20s.
[00:28:59.384 --> 00:29:07.368]  That's how the addiction started, and then they started arresting and SWAT teaming trying to stop it, and of course it just puts money into it, so there's more cops and more drugs on the streets.
[00:29:08.428 --> 00:29:11.450]  Yes, police, there's more drugs on the streets, and more people in prison.
[00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:12.450]  He quote, doesn't work.
[00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.311]  Your war on drugs is a joke, but I'm digressing.
[00:29:15.792 --> 00:29:22.695]  To say she needs to go to rehab, and he means this like a re-education center, where, and oh, it's not your fault.
[00:29:22.735 --> 00:29:25.656]  See, oh, you're a mental patient caller, it's not your fault.
[00:29:26.276 --> 00:29:27.497]  You're like Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:29:28.772 --> 00:29:31.654]  And, uh, Man Cow and others know about it and are freaking out.
[00:29:32.615 --> 00:29:35.697]  But, you notice that it's not getting national coverage.
[00:29:35.878 --> 00:29:37.919]  It's not being covered in the newspapers.
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.322]  It's because they're scared to death of it, and they should be.
[00:29:41.862 --> 00:29:43.423]  We need to push this over the edge.
[00:29:43.463 --> 00:29:45.105]  We need to have this go supernova.
[00:29:45.685 --> 00:29:47.847]  And we'll go to the next level in 9-11 truth.
[00:29:47.907 --> 00:29:49.108]  Let's use O'Donnell.
[00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:52.610]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.071 --> 00:29:54.652]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.672 --> 00:29:58.255]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.481 --> 00:30:04.883]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:30:05.403 --> 00:30:08.685]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:30:09.085 --> 00:30:12.047]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:30:12.307 --> 00:30:18.691]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:30:18.751 --> 00:30:23.154]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:30:23.394 --> 00:30:27.737]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:30:27.917 --> 00:30:30.519]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[00:30:30.539 --> 00:30:33.321]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:30:33.782 --> 00:30:36.323]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:30:36.363 --> 00:30:40.607]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:30:40.667 --> 00:30:41.527]  Treasury bonds.
[00:30:41.807 --> 00:30:46.431]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:48.452]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-7111.
[00:30:49.953 --> 00:30:51.393]  8-9-2-62-38.
[00:30:51.493 --> 00:31:00.015]  That's 1-8888-Xanadu, or 1-8888-X-A-N-A-D-U, and ask for George.
[00:31:01.295 --> 00:31:06.236]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[00:31:06.556 --> 00:31:08.456]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[00:31:08.636 --> 00:31:11.677]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:31:11.857 --> 00:31:14.998]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:31:15.298 --> 00:31:17.158]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[00:31:17.438 --> 00:31:21.143]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:31:21.424 --> 00:31:24.087]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible!
[00:31:24.708 --> 00:31:28.994]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:31:29.214 --> 00:31:33.460]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:38.223]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[00:31:38.523 --> 00:31:42.786]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[00:31:43.106 --> 00:31:48.990]  You will receive information regarding America in prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[00:31:49.291 --> 00:31:51.712]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[00:31:51.932 --> 00:31:52.753]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:31:52.773 --> 00:31:54.114]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[00:32:01.946 --> 00:32:02.347]  Attention!
[00:32:02.467 --> 00:32:05.271]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[00:32:05.572 --> 00:32:09.878]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:32:10.199 --> 00:32:10.880]  Listen closely.
[00:32:11.541 --> 00:32:16.869]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product considered to be the single most
[00:32:16.869 --> 00:32:17.209]  I'm good.
[00:32:34.153 --> 00:32:43.620]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:49.444]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[00:32:49.644 --> 00:32:53.207]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[00:32:53.447 --> 00:32:56.790]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:33:09.642 --> 00:33:11.423]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:11.483 --> 00:33:12.223]  until 2 p.m.
[00:33:12.263 --> 00:33:13.204]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:13.224 --> 00:33:13.964]  We're here live.
[00:33:14.504 --> 00:33:18.926]  A couple of important program notes before I continue into the KSM News and a lot more.
[00:33:20.987 --> 00:33:25.850]  Number one, we have a free podcast, The Radio Show, for Internet listeners every day at 2 p.m.
[00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:26.630]  Central Time.
[00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:32.873]  Over that next hour, it serves out for free to your MP3 or iPod players.
[00:33:33.173 --> 00:33:34.794]  You just go to InfoWars.com.
[00:33:34.814 --> 00:33:38.776]  You click on the button on the right-hand corner that says Podcast.
[00:33:39.336 --> 00:33:43.258]  And then you just select the type of free podcast that you'd like to download.
[00:33:43.638 --> 00:33:53.644]  And if you already have a different podcasting program installed on your MP3 device, it will just download daily to your player.
[00:33:53.724 --> 00:33:55.945]  You can listen to it when you want, how you want.
[00:33:56.405 --> 00:33:57.506]  You can save the shows.
[00:33:57.706 --> 00:33:59.267]  When you're done listening, you can dump them off.
[00:34:01.348 --> 00:34:06.811]  Well, obviously, for iPod listeners, you don't need to be told how it works, but I get lots of questions about how it does work.
[00:34:08.316 --> 00:34:09.397]  It's just up there for free.
[00:34:09.417 --> 00:34:19.748]  We're using a couple terabytes a month now serving this out, so it's something like 30,000 people now are using this and we've just been offering it for about five, six months.
[00:34:20.308 --> 00:34:21.810]  So it's exponentially growing.
[00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:28.497]  So go sign up for the free podcast at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:29.984 --> 00:34:34.686]  Also, we re-stream the show 21 hours a day, from 11 to 2 Central.
[00:34:34.706 --> 00:34:44.689]  We're live, and then the three-hour show is re-aired consecutively via the internet at InfoWars.com on our own streams for you, so you can listen to when you want.
[00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:57.553]  Whether it's from 8 in the morning until 11 when we go live, or 10 at night, or you work at 2 in the morning, tune in when you want, how you want, via podcasting or the streams at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:57.693 --> 00:34:58.853]  Please spread the word about that.
[00:35:00.879 --> 00:35:14.646]  We also are encouraging all the listeners to get PrisonPlanet.tv memberships, 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month, the equivalent of about two and a half cups of Starbucks coffee is the price.
[00:35:15.287 --> 00:35:26.753]  All 15 of my films, hundreds of weekly TV reports, scores and scores of other films have been authorized to post, hundreds and hundreds of our best audio interviews, all in sections, all with the dates,
[00:35:27.433 --> 00:35:27.814]  Yes, we are.
[00:35:44.017 --> 00:35:45.597]  Then it's a wonderful activist tool.
[00:35:45.637 --> 00:35:55.139]  You can burn all of my films from super high bandwidth down to low bandwidth, to disc or to CD, and it's a factory of the information war, a great place to get involved.
[00:35:55.499 --> 00:36:01.100]  Make copies of Terror Storm, Road to Tyranny, Martial Law, burn them to disc, really high quality, and distribute them that way.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.141]  Again, that's PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:04.081 --> 00:36:04.821]  One more comment.
[00:36:05.781 --> 00:36:07.621]  I believe in high quality films and books.
[00:36:07.702 --> 00:36:09.962]  I believe in high quality Made in America water filters.
[00:36:10.848 --> 00:36:12.830]  I believe in high quality shortwave radios.
[00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:14.271]  Things that get the word out.
[00:36:15.512 --> 00:36:17.814]  T-shirts that say 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:36:17.854 --> 00:36:18.635]  Baseball caps.
[00:36:19.135 --> 00:36:20.176]  It's all about the message.
[00:36:20.296 --> 00:36:23.919]  Anything that I'm pushing or selling, it's about having an effect.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.321]  It's about continuing our operations here.
[00:36:26.342 --> 00:36:27.583]  It's about waking others up.
[00:36:27.943 --> 00:36:29.144]  Because we're not going to survive.
[00:36:29.164 --> 00:36:29.985]  We're not going to be free.
[00:36:30.005 --> 00:36:33.668]  We're not going to have any type of future if we don't turn this around.
[00:36:35.482 --> 00:36:43.926]  I do, though, want to say that just because we're patriots and truth-tellers doesn't mean everything in the truth movement is perfect, doesn't mean you can trust everybody in the truth movement.
[00:36:44.566 --> 00:36:55.030]  Just because the government lies and global corporations lie doesn't mean then you can automatically trust everybody in the patriot movement, and that includes me.
[00:36:56.311 --> 00:36:59.112]  I want you to trust but verify, as Ronald Reagan said,
[00:37:00.135 --> 00:37:07.360]  I want you to go and actually look at what we claim, research what we say, and do that with other people as well.
[00:37:08.461 --> 00:37:16.707]  I just morally have to say it, if you don't hear me endorsing a product, that means that I'm neutral on it or I don't endorse it.
[00:37:17.548 --> 00:37:25.594]  Because there's so much, and you know it's like this on mainstream radio too, the Magic Cures, the Snake Oil, the
[00:37:27.077 --> 00:37:42.166]  Just all of it and I care about my listeners and I just want you to have discernment and you know remember that anybody who claims they have an absolute cure for something or anybody that claims they've got and I'm certainly for supplements and things like that and there is a lot of stuff being suppressed that really helps you.
[00:37:42.527 --> 00:37:48.510]  I'm just saying I care about you and just watch yourselves not you know just all all across talk radio itself.
[00:37:50.031 --> 00:37:52.553]  I just have to say that from time to time because it's just
[00:37:54.342 --> 00:37:56.464]  I couldn't sleep with myself at night.
[00:37:57.725 --> 00:38:05.271]  I couldn't get to bed if I didn't tell you that.
[00:38:05.411 --> 00:38:08.013]  Let me go ahead now and get back into the news here.
[00:38:08.033 --> 00:38:11.356]  9-11 news.
[00:38:11.436 --> 00:38:15.319]  Bloomberg kills sensitive 9-11 probe.
[00:38:15.519 --> 00:38:16.620]  That's the mayor of New York.
[00:38:17.657 --> 00:38:30.926]  Mayor Bloomberg held a study on the city's response to the 9-11 attacks after his lawyers said they did not want a report that cited any missteps or dealt with environmental or respirator issues, says a former city official.
[00:38:30.986 --> 00:38:31.666]  Well, of course.
[00:38:32.307 --> 00:38:36.610]  They ordered Giuliani, the feds did, to claim the air was safe a day after.
[00:38:38.591 --> 00:38:45.696]  And tell folks that breathing apparatchik wasn't even needed when they knew it was pure asbestos and concrete and mercury floating around.
[00:38:46.599 --> 00:38:50.168]  And glass particula, aerosolized glass.
[00:38:51.684 --> 00:39:00.671]  City lawyers raised fears that the proposal after action report, which the US Department of Justice had offered to fund, could lead to criticism and fuel lawsuits.
[00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:06.435]  David Longshore, former director of special programs for the city's office of emergency management, told the Post.
[00:39:06.915 --> 00:39:17.583]  The Bloomberg administration acted to sweep any potential problems under the rug, said Longshore, who was trapped in a loading dock outside the WTC while the boat towers collapsed.
[00:39:17.923 --> 00:39:18.804]  He later developed
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.321]  Let's just stop right there.
[00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:22.521]  I'm no rocket scientist, okay?
[00:39:22.541 --> 00:39:24.242]  I'm not a rocket scientist.
[00:39:50.103 --> 00:39:51.204]  And that's what freaks me out.
[00:39:52.445 --> 00:40:11.503]  I remember being on Genesis when 9-11 happened and hearing some of the other shows who were into WMD training, who had degrees in it, saying that this is going to have asbestos, aerosolized glass, concrete, huge
[00:40:12.737 --> 00:40:15.379]  Pyroclastic flows, like a volcano.
[00:40:17.301 --> 00:40:18.982]  They don't need money and food down there.
[00:40:19.022 --> 00:40:20.584]  That's going to be stacked up to the ceiling.
[00:40:20.964 --> 00:40:22.065]  They need respirators.
[00:40:22.285 --> 00:40:23.927]  And for a week, you can see them without them.
[00:40:25.768 --> 00:40:32.133]  Well, I got on air, and others did, and we picked a few local churches, and we had hundreds of respirators.
[00:40:32.854 --> 00:40:35.256]  I even went and bought some and put them in the mail and mailed them there.
[00:40:37.078 --> 00:40:40.901]  I personally, but of course, the media said, just go send money to
[00:40:42.029 --> 00:40:46.272]  Red Cross, United Way, who then gave it to gun control groups and kept most of the money.
[00:40:46.532 --> 00:40:48.813]  As we told you, I had stations actually kick me off the air.
[00:40:48.833 --> 00:40:51.515]  A couple of them going, how dare you knock the Red Cross!
[00:40:51.935 --> 00:40:55.878]  Two of them, of the three that kicked me off, called up and said, I apologize.
[00:40:56.338 --> 00:40:58.339]  Six months later when it came out, it was all true.
[00:40:58.379 --> 00:40:59.060]  How'd you know?
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.781]  Well, the Red Cross and United Way do it every time.
[00:41:02.022 --> 00:41:03.062]  That's how we knew.
[00:41:03.082 --> 00:41:05.884]  I mean, it's not very hard.
[00:41:06.424 --> 00:41:07.905]  I mean, we're not that smart.
[00:41:07.985 --> 00:41:08.946]  We just got memories.
[00:41:09.919 --> 00:41:11.479]  We understand past M.O.
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:15.640]  Past things that have been perpetrated by these people.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.300]  They're perps.
[00:41:16.921 --> 00:41:18.181]  We know who the perpetrators are.
[00:41:18.641 --> 00:41:20.481]  Over and over again, it's the same clowns.
[00:41:22.442 --> 00:41:25.442]  Now, I'm already digressing.
[00:41:25.482 --> 00:41:30.423]  The point is, they knew and they decided to then not give treatment.
[00:41:30.804 --> 00:41:35.124]  The EPA said, oh my God, these firefighters and police and rescue workers are going to be walking dead.
[00:41:35.425 --> 00:41:37.425]  They need massive medical care right now.
[00:41:39.511 --> 00:41:43.334]  And the White House wrote memos and said, this has all come out.
[00:41:43.374 --> 00:41:45.455]  It's been in the New York Papers, but never on national news.
[00:41:45.935 --> 00:41:46.576]  Not that I've seen.
[00:41:47.076 --> 00:41:48.197]  And said, we've got to cover this up.
[00:41:48.237 --> 00:41:50.458]  We don't want to pay out the insurance on this.
[00:41:51.419 --> 00:41:52.620]  We don't want to take care of these people.
[00:41:53.681 --> 00:41:54.721]  And then the story got killed.
[00:41:54.781 --> 00:41:55.562]  And we learned of that.
[00:41:55.802 --> 00:41:56.863]  That came out a year after 9-11.
[00:41:58.183 --> 00:41:58.784]  Less than a year.
[00:41:59.344 --> 00:42:02.566]  And I would talk about it on national shows and be called a conspiracy theorist.
[00:42:02.606 --> 00:42:03.807]  Why, I never heard of that.
[00:42:04.127 --> 00:42:05.108]  You're a liar.
[00:42:05.508 --> 00:42:07.690]  Well, now it is national news.
[00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:12.994]  And again, I was called a conspiracy theory on that.
[00:42:13.354 --> 00:42:14.455]  A conspiracy theorist.
[00:42:15.635 --> 00:42:18.417]  The urban legend sites and places said it wasn't true.
[00:42:18.478 --> 00:42:22.420]  I mean, they say everything that we put out is a lie.
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:22.741]  No, no.
[00:42:22.781 --> 00:42:23.681]  We're telling the truth.
[00:42:23.821 --> 00:42:24.482]  You're lying.
[00:42:25.563 --> 00:42:26.103]  You're lying.
[00:42:28.033 --> 00:42:31.517]  And we're just going to cost the city a lot more money now.
[00:42:32.418 --> 00:42:33.119]  A lot more money.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:38.666]  Because if they would have given proper treatment to those firefighters and police, it would have been a couple billion dollars.
[00:42:41.048 --> 00:42:43.832]  But instead now, it's going to be tens of billions in lawsuits.
[00:42:44.796 --> 00:42:56.120]  But see, they wanted to open Wall Street instantly, and instead of saying, go at your own risk, wear a mask when you're not inside the buildings, you know, warning people, which they could have done day one.
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:57.081]  They knew, the government.
[00:42:57.601 --> 00:43:09.205]  They decided to lie, and then, I mean, I remember the EPA reports later when they were told to lie, weeks after going, we've had detectors out there, national news pieces, the air is clean, it's as clean as any big city.
[00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:10.346]  Remember those quotes?
[00:43:11.593 --> 00:43:12.734]  The air is clean!
[00:43:13.034 --> 00:43:22.661]  They knew it was full of asbestos and aerosolized glass and concrete, microparticles, and they did absolutely nothing.
[00:43:26.363 --> 00:43:30.386]  And you serve them with dog-like devotion, people in government.
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:33.221]  Now, why is this important?
[00:43:33.541 --> 00:43:42.789]  The government claimed in these memos that they didn't want to spend money on EMS, firemen, police, and others, and volunteers, National Guard, military, citizens.
[00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:45.291]  They didn't want to spend money.
[00:43:47.012 --> 00:43:52.877]  But, they will spend a hundred plus billion a year in Iraq on no-bid contracts.
[00:43:53.769 --> 00:44:04.134]  A hundred plus billion a year, and then good old boys will get on radio and go, it's just the way it is, Albertans pro-America company, and they need it.
[00:44:04.855 --> 00:44:06.015]  Oh, they're pro-America, huh?
[00:44:06.055 --> 00:44:07.436]  That's why they just moved to Dubai?
[00:44:07.836 --> 00:44:09.057]  And I've heard them on talk radio.
[00:44:09.077 --> 00:44:10.398]  Well, that's just business, too.
[00:44:12.459 --> 00:44:17.901]  And they're still going to get no-bid contracts being based in Dubai, and paying taxes in Dubai to the Arabs.
[00:44:19.222 --> 00:44:20.643]  You see, America's been took.
[00:44:21.103 --> 00:44:22.804]  It's the oldest game, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:24.202 --> 00:44:27.263]  Everything's leaving by design to bring you to your knees.
[00:44:27.363 --> 00:44:28.223]  You are the target.
[00:44:28.424 --> 00:44:29.884]  The middle class is the target.
[00:44:30.164 --> 00:44:33.765]  That's why illegal aliens don't have to show IDs to get bank accounts or housing loans.
[00:44:34.226 --> 00:44:40.328]  That's why the cops in 800 plus sanctuary cities don't look for ID with illegals and have been ordered to let them go.
[00:44:40.848 --> 00:44:42.549]  Mainstream news, but I've talked to cops.
[00:44:42.949 --> 00:44:44.349]  They have been told they'll be fired.
[00:44:45.089 --> 00:44:46.510]  But you're going to be treated like cattle.
[00:44:47.606 --> 00:44:51.689]  Because it's designed to bring down the middle class.
[00:44:52.129 --> 00:44:53.610]  It's designed to consolidate.
[00:44:54.231 --> 00:44:56.652]  Look, I want to make it clear.
[00:44:56.832 --> 00:45:00.955]  I'm not against these immigrant populations trying to flee total oppression and serfdom.
[00:45:01.435 --> 00:45:07.360]  But it's like America's a lifeboat that can only hold 100 people, and they're trying to swamp the boat with 10,000.
[00:45:09.457 --> 00:45:09.917]  You understand?
[00:45:09.957 --> 00:45:11.238]  It's very, very simple.
[00:45:11.398 --> 00:45:16.099]  I'm not against the people in the North Atlantic frozen waters trying to climb into my lifeboat.
[00:45:16.459 --> 00:45:20.080]  But the lifeboat's already got so many people in it that it's about to go under the waves.
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:23.501]  You cannot help them by bringing them in here.
[00:45:24.081 --> 00:45:31.043]  I'm not against some poor family from Venezuela, or Nicaragua, or El Salvador, or Russia, or China.
[00:45:32.366 --> 00:45:34.107]  But I am against our government.
[00:45:34.547 --> 00:45:58.514]  Now, I read a report last week that over 50,000 South Koreans came in last year, and most of them fly in, in the third trimester, in the last month of the trimester, in the ninth month, when the ninth month is about to kick off, I guess the middle of the eighth, and they come in for anchor babies, jackpot babies, casino babies,
[00:46:00.103 --> 00:46:01.204]  Slot machine babies.
[00:46:01.404 --> 00:46:02.505]  Then they hit the jackpot!
[00:46:03.165 --> 00:46:06.167]  Average birth, $9,000 in California.
[00:46:06.827 --> 00:46:08.368]  It's only $7,000 in Texas.
[00:46:10.429 --> 00:46:11.190]  It had all the numbers.
[00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:12.090]  It was in the newspaper.
[00:46:13.011 --> 00:46:14.012]  I meant to bring that in.
[00:46:14.032 --> 00:46:15.192]  I was reading it in a restaurant.
[00:46:17.314 --> 00:46:18.635]  I couldn't believe it was in the newspaper.
[00:46:19.335 --> 00:46:22.437]  I didn't know Koreans were flooding in doing the jackpot baby deal.
[00:46:23.539 --> 00:46:24.159]  But why not?
[00:46:24.199 --> 00:46:25.140]  You get on an airplane.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.320]  You say you're a tourist.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.220]  You come stay in a hotel for three weeks.
[00:46:28.501 --> 00:46:29.261]  Your water breaks.
[00:46:29.281 --> 00:46:30.281]  You drive into the hospital.
[00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:30.781]  I'm here!
[00:46:30.801 --> 00:46:32.622]  And man, it's the hospital.
[00:46:32.642 --> 00:46:34.562]  Listen, my finger was chopped off.
[00:46:38.183 --> 00:46:40.284]  And I went to the hospital on a Sunday.
[00:46:42.285 --> 00:46:46.426]  And literally, I sat there downtown at the city hospital.
[00:46:48.547 --> 00:46:49.587]  That's where the ambulance took me.
[00:46:52.751 --> 00:46:54.893]  And I'm there.
[00:46:57.396 --> 00:47:03.421]  And after about 45 minutes, I'm noticing the illegal aliens are just going right in the door.
[00:47:03.442 --> 00:47:04.102]  They're not bleeding.
[00:47:04.122 --> 00:47:04.743]  They're not hurt.
[00:47:05.303 --> 00:47:06.104]  They're not anything.
[00:47:06.144 --> 00:47:07.205]  They can't speak English.
[00:47:08.667 --> 00:47:10.428]  Please don't tell me I don't know they were immigrants.
[00:47:10.468 --> 00:47:17.155]  The cowboy hats, the wrangler jeans, the whole family's police.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:26.325]  And because the hospital knows, they've been told to take care of them first, because they're not going to have any insurance, no payment, they don't even ask their names, man, they just go right in.
[00:47:26.585 --> 00:47:37.433]  I'm up there with my hand wrapped up, with my finger dangling by a piece of skin, and I got my wallet out, and I'm standing there going, here, here's my insurance, 90% coverage, here's all this stuff, let me in.
[00:47:38.293 --> 00:47:38.794]  Let me in.
[00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:40.355]  After about 45 minutes, I said, listen,
[00:47:40.979 --> 00:47:42.320]  And I never play this card.
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:43.961]  But I said, you know who I am.
[00:47:44.001 --> 00:47:44.841]  Yes, we know who you are.
[00:47:45.262 --> 00:47:50.585]  I'm going to go absolutely crazy on the radio, and I'm going to attack, I'm going to sue, whatever.
[00:47:50.645 --> 00:47:51.926]  You will attach my finger.
[00:47:52.886 --> 00:47:56.769]  Because my dad had gotten there, and you know, he's in the medical field, a dentist and oral surgeon.
[00:47:56.809 --> 00:47:58.330]  He said, yeah, you need to get that attached fast.
[00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:00.011]  And I didn't want to lose my finger.
[00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:01.872]  It's numb right now is this.
[00:48:01.892 --> 00:48:08.336]  A lot of that's because it took him about an hour and a half to get, you know, get to sewing the thing up.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.421]  So thank you, illegal aliens.
[00:48:11.441 --> 00:48:13.862]  That would have been an illegal alien man right in the door.
[00:48:14.743 --> 00:48:15.663]  Just boom.
[00:48:15.803 --> 00:48:20.406]  I mean, you know, this is the type of stuff, and again, I'm not against these people.
[00:48:21.787 --> 00:48:24.248]  But the point is, they're a weapon pointed at America.
[00:48:26.016 --> 00:48:38.441]  Bottom line, look at how they pull out all the stops, have two sets of rules, and frankly, I'm not going to put up with some idiot state police pulling me over and giving me the big line about, you were five miles over the speed limit, I gotta give you a ticket.
[00:48:38.881 --> 00:48:39.841]  The law is the law.
[00:48:40.141 --> 00:48:42.702]  Then I just look at them and go, you don't arrest illegal aliens.
[00:48:42.822 --> 00:48:47.344]  Well, most of the time we don't, but that's a separate issue.
[00:48:48.264 --> 00:48:49.565]  The judges let them go.
[00:48:49.645 --> 00:48:50.625]  I'm not going to talk about it.
[00:48:54.446 --> 00:48:57.387]  Well, still then, don't give me a... Well, we need the revenue.
[00:48:57.767 --> 00:49:01.729]  You don't... They tell you that when they keep you at a subsistence level.
[00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:11.313]  When they take... The average cop's generating almost $300,000 for whatever municipal system or state system they pay into.
[00:49:12.833 --> 00:49:15.014]  And you're getting on average $35,000.
[00:49:15.314 --> 00:49:16.135]  You are dumb.
[00:49:16.595 --> 00:49:21.717]  And they're always telling you, there's budget cuts, there's budget cuts to scare you to go out and be more abusive.
[00:49:22.717 --> 00:49:23.918]  And then they fire you
[00:49:25.166 --> 00:49:29.968]  By giving you demerits and bad reviews if you don't go out and write a bunch of them.
[00:49:30.388 --> 00:49:31.588]  You're crooks, okay?
[00:49:31.928 --> 00:49:33.549]  Bottom line, you're crooks.
[00:49:34.289 --> 00:49:35.530]  You go, well, why am I a crook?
[00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:37.470]  You let illegal aliens go.
[00:49:38.691 --> 00:49:42.172]  You don't throw the book at them, but you throw the book at American families.
[00:49:43.112 --> 00:49:45.713]  Whether they're Hispanic, black, white, Asian, it doesn't matter.
[00:49:46.353 --> 00:49:47.934]  We are the fat hogs.
[00:49:48.014 --> 00:49:48.954]  We are the targets.
[00:49:49.875 --> 00:49:51.015]  And I, for one, am sick of it.
[00:49:51.375 --> 00:49:52.335]  Alright, I'm already digressing.
[00:49:52.375 --> 00:49:53.696]  I'm already almost out of time here.
[00:49:56.016 --> 00:49:58.438]  The point is, is that everything's moving offshore.
[00:49:58.458 --> 00:50:02.302]  Boeing has moved to China, you know, 10 years ago.
[00:50:02.782 --> 00:50:05.805]  Now they're going to shut down some of their final factories here in the U.S.
[00:50:05.825 --> 00:50:07.867]  and even move their executive branch there.
[00:50:09.189 --> 00:50:11.351]  Most of their actual, you know, command base there.
[00:50:12.352 --> 00:50:15.995]  China has now reverse engineered it and is going to come out with their Boeing clones.
[00:50:17.096 --> 00:50:20.980]  That's the Financial Times of London trying to challenge Boeing and Airbus.
[00:50:22.984 --> 00:50:25.025]  Meanwhile, good stuff's happening.
[00:50:25.065 --> 00:50:35.847]  The state legislature voted a hundred and something to, I don't know, I've got the vote here in the stack, to say no to Perry claiming you've got to take shots.
[00:50:35.907 --> 00:50:37.808]  But meanwhile, U.S.
[00:50:37.848 --> 00:50:40.968]  soldiers' vaccination left young son in deep trouble.
[00:50:41.409 --> 00:50:43.249]  We'll cover this when we get back.
[00:50:43.889 --> 00:50:45.350]  Try to get into Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
[00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:47.570]  Got a special guest scheduled the next hour.
[00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:51.151]  And we'll also be taking your phone calls as well.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.778]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com are the websites.

[00:52:10.556 --> 00:52:18.183]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:52:18.897 --> 00:52:25.961]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:52:26.341 --> 00:52:37.767]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:52:38.087 --> 00:52:41.669]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:43.971]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:52:44.311 --> 00:52:48.153]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:07.982]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.662 --> 00:54:10.983]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:11.563 --> 00:54:19.445]  Seven years behind the wire, Mark Gregory Kornke, attacked by Nightline, you name it, will be joining us.
[00:54:19.485 --> 00:54:24.267]  They tried to pin Oklahoma City on him because they were exposing day one, it was an inside job.
[00:54:25.847 --> 00:54:29.288]  Mark Kornke joining us on air from Michigan in the next hour.
[00:54:30.282 --> 00:54:32.104]  We'll go over a bunch of news, what we can get his take on it.
[00:54:32.664 --> 00:54:37.209]  Toddler contracts rare infection from smallpox vaccination.
[00:54:37.569 --> 00:54:39.331]  Now, notice the AP calls this rare.
[00:54:39.751 --> 00:54:49.120]  Then the doctors later say, well the last time it happened was when the military tried to give smallpox shots in the early 1990s and then again right after 9-11 when they tried it.
[00:54:51.276 --> 00:55:03.399]  And large percentages of those that took it, who were adults, have autoimmune responses in their vascular system and have heart attacks, arrhythmia, all sorts of palpitations, problems.
[00:55:04.279 --> 00:55:08.541]  And many people have autoimmune responses and die.
[00:55:08.561 --> 00:55:12.402]  And they go, it's not smallpox, but it's a cousin of it.
[00:55:14.736 --> 00:55:20.858]  And that's why when they told the medical workers in 2002, remember to take it, and the police and firemen, they almost unanimously said no.
[00:55:21.198 --> 00:55:25.660]  They ordered 14,000 medical workers and police and EMS first responders to take it.
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:27.620]  Let's say 14,000, 14 million.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.961]  And only 400 said yes.
[00:55:31.681 --> 00:55:36.763]  A toddler contracts rare infection from smallpox vaccination.
[00:55:36.803 --> 00:55:42.365]  A two-year-old Indiana boy and his mother, both of them, contracted a rare and life-threatening infection from his mother's
[00:55:43.269 --> 00:55:46.834]  From his father's smallpox vaccination according to a published report.
[00:55:46.895 --> 00:55:58.131]  Again, a two-year-old Indiana boy and his mother contracted a rare and life-threatening infection from his soldier father's smallpox vaccination according to a published report.
[00:55:59.682 --> 00:56:00.943]  They've now got him on lockdown.
[00:56:01.143 --> 00:56:07.127]  The boy and his mother were being treated in a specially ventilated room at the University of Chicago's Comer Children's Hospital.
[00:56:07.528 --> 00:56:09.309]  The Chicago Tribune reported Saturday.
[00:56:09.729 --> 00:56:12.711]  The family's name and hometown were not released at their request.
[00:56:13.231 --> 00:56:23.979]  The boy developed a virulent rash over 80% of his body earlier this month after becoming in contact with his father, who had recently been vaccinated for smallpox before he was to be deployed overseas by the Army.
[00:56:24.619 --> 00:56:27.141]  By the way, that's an illegal, unauthorized vaccine.
[00:56:27.181 --> 00:56:28.222]  That's why it got shut down.
[00:56:29.375 --> 00:56:35.637]  Physicians stress that the boy was not suffered from smallpox, but from related virus which is used to convey immunity.
[00:56:36.498 --> 00:56:37.498]  It's cowpox, folks.
[00:56:37.578 --> 00:56:39.699]  It is smallpox, okay?
[00:56:39.739 --> 00:56:54.105]  To a much deadlier disease, they said the infection was a rare condition caused by eczema vaccinentum, which has not been reported since at least 1990 when the military ended a previous program for smallpox vaccination.
[00:56:54.125 --> 00:56:54.685]  That's not true.
[00:56:54.705 --> 00:56:56.146]  It popped up in 2002 and 3 when they tried it again.
[00:56:58.516 --> 00:57:02.717]  The military began smallpox vaccinations again in 2002 because of bioterrorism fears.
[00:57:03.118 --> 00:57:05.478]  Doctors said the child suffered from eczema.
[00:57:06.439 --> 00:57:14.321]  We've had the fathers on and mothers on of soldiers who take this stuff and have autoimmune diseases that are like Ebola as every orifice bleeds out.
[00:57:14.341 --> 00:57:16.162]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[00:57:16.182 --> 00:57:20.063]  I mean, it just never ends here.
[00:57:21.384 --> 00:57:22.764]  It absolutely never ends.
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:41.913]  Al Gore is in deep trouble as everybody dissects his film and finds out that ice core samples show that carbon dioxide comes roughly 200 years after a temperature spike and that we've been heating for the last 250 years from the ice cores.
[00:57:43.135 --> 00:57:44.836]  And that yes, we do have global warming.
[00:57:44.856 --> 00:57:45.877]  Let's be clear about this.
[00:57:46.337 --> 00:57:48.219]  There is climate change, there is global warming.
[00:57:48.931 --> 00:57:57.073]  And I'm not going to say fossil fuels are good because of how they refine them, using deadly chemicals and compounds like fluoride to crack the molecules.
[00:57:57.873 --> 00:58:00.414]  I'm not saying that we shouldn't try to have a better environment.
[00:58:01.034 --> 00:58:02.814]  Hell, the honeybees are dying all over the planet.
[00:58:04.295 --> 00:58:14.577]  But the hype about man causing global warming, even being a small contributing factors of fraud, and there's solutions in even bigger fraud.
[00:58:15.097 --> 00:58:17.898]  Global taxation, which the UN has announced.
[00:58:20.905 --> 00:58:39.996]  I hope that you'll visit InfoWars.com, the secure online shopping cart, and get my new film, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, America, Freedom to Fascism, and the four new films we're covering, Carrying, Aftermath, Unanswered Questions from 9-11, American Blackout, 9-11 Press for Truth, and Iraq for Sale, The War Profiteers, all on big discount.

[00:59:02.609 --> 00:59:03.430]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:05.091]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.751 --> 00:59:09.734]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.934 --> 00:59:14.057]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.999 --> 00:59:25.246]  Mark Kornke, or Mark from Michigan, has done legendary feats in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:59:26.671 --> 00:59:32.432]  In mobilizing the population and teaching the population how to go out and mobilize others in the information war.
[00:59:33.533 --> 00:59:52.297]  I woke up kind of on my own many many years ago and then discovered Mark Quarante and he was saying all the things that I had observed and more and I did learn quite a bit from Mark and then of course I interviewed him I guess back in like 1997 and he had just fired up a radio network
[00:59:53.195 --> 01:00:19.294]  uh... with other parties and uh... they picked up my local show and we were off to the races and he was set up several times i don't think we need to spend all day on that but they tried to set him up with bank robbery which they later admitted he wasn't involved with he'd never been involved in any crimes in his life his family was uh... in the sheriff department of course he had a distinguished uh... service in the army and intelligence and uh... they basically ran him off the road
[01:00:20.046 --> 01:00:23.527]  And then charged him with that and put him in maximum security for seven years.
[01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:25.647]  And I have the squad car video.
[01:00:25.687 --> 01:00:28.368]  We aired it many times on the local television show.
[01:00:29.448 --> 01:00:37.050]  And he spent seven years in prison in Michigan, the entire sentence, and just witnessed unbelievable things.
[01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:38.730]  And before he leaves us today, we'll get into that.
[01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:41.791]  But I want to... He's been working on the inside.
[01:00:43.459 --> 01:00:50.762]  And talking to him, I think he's sharper and more focused than when I knew him 7, 10, 12, 13 years ago.
[01:00:52.302 --> 01:00:59.084]  He is just really, really informed and has been following the show from prison.
[01:00:59.104 --> 01:01:00.165]  I was flattered to hear that.
[01:01:00.485 --> 01:01:04.406]  And he's written several books while he's been in there and I can't wait to see him.
[01:01:04.446 --> 01:01:09.368]  I know it's going to be great work and I definitely want to carry them in our online video bookstore and system.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.740]  But we're about to break in just a few minutes.
[01:01:12.481 --> 01:01:17.522]  I want to get Mark to talk about 9-11, talk about any issues that he just wanted to discuss while he was in prison.
[01:01:18.562 --> 01:01:20.903]  I want to get him to talk about how the people are waking up.
[01:01:21.423 --> 01:01:28.025]  I love how he shatters the illusion that we're a minority, we're really the majority, we just don't know that.
[01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:33.346]  And where he sees all this going, I agree with Mark, 9-11 was an act of desperation.
[01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:42.181]  Well, we talked for an hour and a half the other night, and just so many points, and I should have taken notes to go over all those points.
[01:01:42.542 --> 01:01:44.723]  Mark, it's great to have you back on air.
[01:01:45.023 --> 01:01:45.823]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:01:45.903 --> 01:01:47.064]  It's good to hear your voice, too.
[01:01:49.185 --> 01:01:56.128]  Again, I talked to you, and you seem to have been buoyed by your tribulation in the concentration camp.
[01:01:57.285 --> 01:01:59.147]  Well, the thing is, you gotta stay busy.
[01:01:59.467 --> 01:02:03.230]  First of all, it's treating it like a monastery rather than a prison.
[01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:14.719]  I'll bet a rather vicious monastery in some ways, but nonetheless, an example is, one thing I didn't do was purchase a television for the entire time that I was there.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:26.709]  And a lot of people always wondered about that, and I had more than ample opportunity to do it over and over again, but that becomes a mind-sucking tool, especially when you're dealing with nothing but cable stations that are designed to give you okra wimpy,
[01:02:27.509 --> 01:02:29.971]  And horrendous revolver, so I'm sorry.
[01:02:31.012 --> 01:02:32.673]  Now it is a mind-sucking tool.
[01:02:33.293 --> 01:02:34.254]  It's interesting to watch.
[01:02:34.314 --> 01:02:44.721]  I call it the tombs at night because if you don't have the television and you're paying attention to your surroundings, it was like a series of flashing gray orbs.
[01:02:45.405 --> 01:02:47.967]  Over the walls or through the cellar.
[01:02:48.087 --> 01:02:49.028]  I say that all the time.
[01:02:49.088 --> 01:02:52.930]  I walk the dog at like 10 o'clock at night and all the houses are glowing blue.
[01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:55.112]  You see it flashing the mind control box.
[01:02:55.392 --> 01:02:56.052]  And flickering.
[01:02:56.232 --> 01:02:57.113]  That's the fascinating thing.
[01:02:57.153 --> 01:03:02.276]  Watching the sequence of flickers and flashes that come off the screen when you're not looking at the screen.
[01:03:02.316 --> 01:03:05.659]  Especially when you have say three, four hundred of them in close proximity.
[01:03:06.359 --> 01:03:09.081]  And it's almost like watching some form of disco lighting system.
[01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:15.693]  Anyway, the thing is that rather than watching the television, of course, it's the same thing outside.
[01:03:15.733 --> 01:03:17.534]  I never had any time really to watch much television.
[01:03:17.554 --> 01:03:19.795]  When I did, it was kind of in concentrated form.
[01:03:20.435 --> 01:03:24.816]  Otherwise, we were busy 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
[01:03:25.657 --> 01:03:27.377]  Well, the same thing basically inside.
[01:03:27.477 --> 01:03:28.338]  Stayed very busy.
[01:03:29.558 --> 01:03:30.638]  Helped with a lot of legal work.
[01:03:30.678 --> 01:03:33.259]  I've been doing pro se work before I went in myself.
[01:03:33.379 --> 01:03:37.701]  In fact, we were pretty successful in the courts where we didn't let the bar members get involved.
[01:03:38.933 --> 01:03:40.515]  Stay there, stay there Mark Cornkey.
[01:03:40.535 --> 01:03:49.288]  We're going to be back in three minutes and go through just your view on the planet, where you see things going in the future with the battle for the Republic.
[01:03:49.629 --> 01:03:50.450]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:51.391]  It's Genesis.
[01:03:53.348 --> 01:03:58.430]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:03:58.490 --> 01:04:05.793]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:04:05.953 --> 01:04:16.578]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:04:16.778 --> 01:04:21.320]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:26.604]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:04:26.804 --> 01:04:29.747]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:39.795]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:05:02.039 --> 01:05:09.661]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.382 --> 01:05:17.444]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.824 --> 01:05:29.388]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.568 --> 01:05:33.129]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.509 --> 01:05:35.470]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:39.631]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:52.859 --> 01:05:55.460]  Right now, 65% of Americans are overweight.
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:06:01.743]  Experts say by the year 2010, that number will increase to 75% and 35% will be obese.
[01:06:01.903 --> 01:06:11.047]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach, host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, has done extensive research and has found what he believes is the biggest breakthrough in weight loss in 50 years.
[01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:12.108]  It's called Slender FX.

[01:06:22.277 --> 01:06:24.319]  Finally, a weight loss breakthrough you can trust.

[01:06:53.146 --> 01:06:58.191]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.571 --> 01:07:00.813]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:30.564]  You know, I really don't have words to describe how thankful I am to Mark Kornke for all the work he's done for this country.
[01:07:31.404 --> 01:07:42.550]  And when he made America in Peril 1 and 2, I remember in the mid-1990s, late 1990s, watching those two and airing them over and over again on local AXA television when I started out.
[01:07:43.371 --> 01:07:57.017]  And what Mark's good at, and this is what folks have always said that I'm pretty good at, is connecting the dots, showing people how these different integrated systems merge together for a big picture or threat assessment.
[01:07:57.977 --> 01:08:00.418]  And I tell you, Mark, you probably don't
[01:08:01.432 --> 01:08:15.496]  It's hard to see yourself grow because it's incremental, because you're with yourself every day, but it's like seeing somebody you haven't seen in years, or seeing a 10-year-old, and then you see them next, they're a 15-year-old, my, they've grown.
[01:08:16.016 --> 01:08:18.537]  And of course, in that analogy, I don't mean you were like a 10-year-old.
[01:08:18.557 --> 01:08:23.139]  I'm saying in time, it's like seeing a tree that's grown, a tree you haven't seen in seven years.
[01:08:23.619 --> 01:08:30.761]  Talking to you for an hour and a half the other night, you seemed even more focused than you'd been seven years ago when I knew you.
[01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:34.722]  I mean, do you think you grew while you were in prison?
[01:08:35.402 --> 01:08:41.064]  Well, I think the advantage we had is dealing with... First of all, before I went into prison, I've dealt with millions of people.
[01:08:41.665 --> 01:08:43.725]  A great example is he brought up American Peril.
[01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:45.926]  Remember, American Peril came out in 1993.
[01:08:47.046 --> 01:08:59.991]  American Peril 2 comes out in 1994, and American Peril 3, which of course overlaps and covers basically the short window just before the Oklahoma City bombing,
[01:09:00.635 --> 01:09:05.981]  Covered the, for instance, the Omnibus Crime Package slash the Patriot Act as it was originally proposed.
[01:09:06.561 --> 01:09:12.467]  One of the things that has happened is I've been, I've actually in a way got arrest.
[01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:21.637]  One of the things that happened before, it's not so much that it in any way shapes lower, but the biggest problem is dealing with 48 states non-stop, 24 hours a day.
[01:09:24.108 --> 01:09:30.352]  And working as a response unit because we went around the country and helped to negotiate or deal with people.
[01:09:30.372 --> 01:09:32.574]  So basically you've had a nice rest in a way.
[01:09:33.014 --> 01:09:38.297]  Yeah, in some ways it's an aggressive rest because the environment you're in, you had to pay attention constantly.
[01:09:38.337 --> 01:09:44.401]  Anybody who's listening right now who's behind the wire or behind the walls knows exactly how it is.
[01:09:44.461 --> 01:09:47.483]  You've got to be paying attention constantly, but people are listening.
[01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:53.934]  There's two states that people get into when they're in a situation like that.
[01:09:53.994 --> 01:10:00.880]  They either get off into the flippant and they get into a lot of problems, especially because gambling and things like that are always an enticement for certain people.
[01:10:01.761 --> 01:10:03.462]  Or they treat it like a monastery.
[01:10:03.502 --> 01:10:05.224]  They get into the subject matter.
[01:10:05.244 --> 01:10:07.426]  They get into the process of learning.
[01:10:08.026 --> 01:10:13.391]  Now for myself, I had already decided what I was going to do in a situation like that anyway.
[01:10:14.032 --> 01:10:16.734]  So what I did is practice what I preached.
[01:10:17.661 --> 01:10:23.786]  The good thing about that is that it gave me an opportunity to finish a lot of other things that otherwise I would have had to have shared time with.
[01:10:24.527 --> 01:10:32.654]  In a way, I think the other side is going to probably regret this because I had a chance to focus in the written word, which I've always been immersed in.
[01:10:32.694 --> 01:10:39.059]  If you've ever been to my house, anybody who's ever visited, people that are listening right now know I have tens of thousands of books.
[01:10:39.619 --> 01:10:40.940]  The walls are lined with books.
[01:10:41.741 --> 01:10:44.003]  Everything under the table has books.
[01:10:44.123 --> 01:10:45.204]  If you go through my house,
[01:10:45.879 --> 01:10:50.344]  I can pretty well cover any subject that you'd like to cover, and my books don't require batteries.
[01:10:50.844 --> 01:10:57.932]  What they do require is, you know, attaching the gray matter and, you know, using the eyes to track those symbols that are on that funny piece of white paper.
[01:10:59.033 --> 01:11:08.043]  The advantage, of course, in the situation I was in is, if you treat the environment as a monastery, you can be absolutely focused on whatever task you wish to perform.
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:17.683]  So again, I got heavily into the law, which I've been doing outside work with Justice Pro Se and many other organizations around the country.
[01:11:18.184 --> 01:11:29.468]  That was exciting because we actually helped, as in teams, I helped with a case that not only was reviewed by the Supreme Court, but was actually heard by the Supreme Court.
[01:11:30.128 --> 01:11:35.370]  And if you remember how long it takes to get to the Supreme Court, this process was quite extensive.
[01:11:35.410 --> 01:11:38.151]  And it's one of virtually hundreds of cases that I helped with.
[01:11:38.792 --> 01:11:45.436]  Now, in the process, of course, I also instructed many, many people or helped at least put people on a certain path.
[01:11:45.497 --> 01:12:00.667]  Mark, we also talked the other night about how you also were able to wake up a lot of the jail guards, the prison people, and that you got moved around every few months or every year or so, depending on which move it was, and that a lot of times you had friends in the system.
[01:12:02.448 --> 01:12:04.169]  As you said, we've got people everywhere.
[01:12:04.429 --> 01:12:24.940]  Yes, one of the things to remember is that we have people on both sides of the line, so to speak, and in that respect, if you're in that situation, it's interesting that everybody has heard something, and now as things have gotten more serious, and especially with the risk, you know, the threat to jobs that they thought were untouchable,
[01:12:25.832 --> 01:12:33.737]  For instance, the guards thought that they were always going to be at the level of pay that they're at, but the states, of course, now want a cheaper prison guard system.
[01:12:34.757 --> 01:12:43.122]  In the same breath, this affected the prisoners, because they make only pennies a day, and, Alex, they're trying to take even some of that, or half of that, from them.
[01:12:44.062 --> 01:12:53.347]  And I could go on a multitude of stories about some of the things that the state had done, just with prisoners who already only make like 79 cents a day, or, say, a dollar a day,
[01:12:54.778 --> 01:12:56.820]  Being told that they were going to cut their pay by 50%.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.863]  And then good old boys out there go, good, make them prisoners work.
[01:13:01.464 --> 01:13:13.133]  We're talking about working 8-10 hours a day for 75 cents a dollar a day, which you then use to buy toothpaste, toothbrushes, combs, everything.
[01:13:13.274 --> 01:13:23.262]  You have to buy all of your toiletries, you have to buy all your personal items, and it's interesting that, again, let's say that you expect to do that, the problem is that for a lot of these guys,
[01:13:23.769 --> 01:13:28.873]  There are so many supplemental costs that they really can't keep up with it.
[01:13:28.893 --> 01:13:30.834]  And there are more prisoners than there are jobs.
[01:13:31.074 --> 01:13:32.615]  The prison population is going up.
[01:13:32.655 --> 01:13:39.099]  So like the Soviet system, which is really what this country is emulating right now, what you're seeing is rack them and stack them.
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:48.466]  And there are no more urinals or toilets or bathrooms than there were when they started, but they're doubling or tripling the number of prisoners into the same space.
[01:13:49.031 --> 01:13:52.013]  They know that this is going to cause problems.
[01:13:52.073 --> 01:13:54.574]  What was high security prison like?
[01:13:55.515 --> 01:13:57.056]  Well, actually, I was at different levels.
[01:13:57.296 --> 01:14:01.839]  It's interesting at the upper end, as we know, it's a little more aggressive.
[01:14:01.939 --> 01:14:05.821]  But on the other hand, I mean, as far as a little more aggressive, it's a lot more aggressive.
[01:14:06.382 --> 01:14:09.764]  But there are a lot of people that were listening, a lot of people that were thinking.
[01:14:10.484 --> 01:14:17.949]  And you actually find that the people there are very focused, especially when it comes to working with law, because their lives depend upon it.
[01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:24.536]  I met some young men who, of course, became students in other ways because we were teaching a number of different subjects.
[01:14:24.616 --> 01:14:32.223]  I was working on a number of subjects that were very specific and would point them in another direction with regard to the law.
[01:14:32.923 --> 01:14:43.233]  And these young men, in some cases, one young man was 16 years old, came in with 11 life sentences, but they hadn't killed anybody and hadn't injured anybody.
[01:14:43.894 --> 01:14:44.995]  It was under the drug laws.
[01:14:45.435 --> 01:14:47.916]  And again, he was in the wrong place, right time.
[01:14:48.076 --> 01:14:49.717]  I've read all of his cases.
[01:14:50.258 --> 01:14:51.878]  Well, he came in at 16.
[01:14:52.019 --> 01:14:53.900]  He was in his 20s when I met him.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:58.422]  And he had taken and knocked down 10 out of 11 life sentences.
[01:14:58.442 --> 01:15:00.443]  In other words, gone all the way to the high courts.
[01:15:00.923 --> 01:15:02.204]  They had upheld his arguments.
[01:15:02.885 --> 01:15:05.346]  And he was working his way down, so to speak.
[01:15:06.292 --> 01:15:14.376]  As far as the level of interest... By the way, have you noticed now the feds are moving to block jailhouse lawyers?
[01:15:14.916 --> 01:15:17.477]  Oh, I can believe that.
[01:15:18.117 --> 01:15:19.698]  We saw this from the inside.
[01:15:20.939 --> 01:15:23.680]  One of the reasons is that bar members are bought and paid for.
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:26.441]  They are bought and paid for royalty.
[01:15:26.941 --> 01:15:30.423]  They're going to do whatever it takes to streamline the business.
[01:15:30.523 --> 01:15:32.804]  And if the business is to put more people in prison,
[01:15:33.263 --> 01:15:41.707]  And of course we've seen that number grow for the last three years by the millions, literally by one million to two million to now almost three million people in prisons in America.
[01:15:42.547 --> 01:15:46.569]  The Bar Association's job is to make the business grow.
[01:15:47.149 --> 01:15:53.612]  Well, when you hear any slob talking about streamlining, that means taking away from your constitutional rights
[01:15:54.111 --> 01:15:56.652]  Or streamlining your constitutional rights.
[01:15:56.712 --> 01:15:59.153]  It means railroading you right into the camp.
[01:15:59.333 --> 01:15:59.873]  That's right.
[01:15:59.913 --> 01:16:04.135]  He puts his little paw on your shoulder and surrenders you as property over to the state.
[01:16:04.895 --> 01:16:07.876]  And that's really what they're trying to do is they're trying to stack more people up.
[01:16:07.936 --> 01:16:10.957]  Now here's the key to this and this is important Alex.
[01:16:11.497 --> 01:16:15.379]  The key to this and why they're putting more people in prison is because of the penal bonds.
[01:16:16.299 --> 01:16:21.401]  Penal bonds are generated just like any other bridge bond or whatever because prisoners
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:28.683]  Under the American Constitution and under the state constitutions, indentured servitude is authorized.
[01:16:29.683 --> 01:16:32.344]  So it's literally being sold as chattel?
[01:16:32.744 --> 01:16:32.984]  Right.
[01:16:33.044 --> 01:16:37.706]  Go to your state constitution and read through the body of it and then look at state laws.
[01:16:38.266 --> 01:16:40.727]  Indentured servitude means you become a piece of property.
[01:16:40.747 --> 01:16:42.368]  The property can then be bonded.
[01:16:42.908 --> 01:16:45.949]  These bonds are generated by the federal government.
[01:16:46.491 --> 01:16:52.132]  And authorized by each of the states, of course, I should say verified by each of the states.
[01:16:52.192 --> 01:16:56.933]  When you're surrendered as a piece of property, these bonds then go into the trade market.
[01:16:57.033 --> 01:17:00.574]  Their average price is about 27 cents on the dollar.
[01:17:00.634 --> 01:17:03.394]  And you were able to get copies of these from some of the big brokerage houses?
[01:17:03.714 --> 01:17:04.614]  Actually, yes, we did.
[01:17:04.634 --> 01:17:09.555]  In fact, we know that Merrill Lynch, for instance, had one and has more than one.
[01:17:09.575 --> 01:17:12.656]  They have God knows how many hundreds of thousands of these bonds.
[01:17:13.001 --> 01:17:13.842]  They're not the only one.
[01:17:13.882 --> 01:17:16.584]  They're traded all over the United States and all over the world.
[01:17:16.664 --> 01:17:18.225]  So, summing it up, we're about to break.
[01:17:19.026 --> 01:17:20.087]  We know it's a big business.
[01:17:20.127 --> 01:17:23.130]  I've tracked back the big banks that own a lot of the private prison companies.
[01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:24.911]  Clear drug cartels.
[01:17:24.931 --> 01:17:25.512]  You've got to love it.
[01:17:25.732 --> 01:17:27.593]  They ship in heroin and cocaine.
[01:17:27.633 --> 01:17:33.078]  People are dumb enough to use it and they put you in their prisons working for 15, 20 cents an hour for them.
[01:17:33.538 --> 01:17:34.039]  Exactly.
[01:17:34.079 --> 01:17:37.882]  And you know, the sad part about it is that this is right out in the open where you can find it.
[01:17:38.022 --> 01:17:40.164]  Merle Lynch acknowledged it, but they said initially
[01:17:40.524 --> 01:17:45.752]  Because we weren't stockholders, because the person wasn't a stockholder, was checking on his number, they couldn't divulge it.
[01:17:45.913 --> 01:17:54.126]  So we had his agent outside, buy some stock, and then access the specific information because they had to surrender it once he was a stockholder.
[01:17:54.805 --> 01:17:55.185]  Amazing.
[01:17:55.225 --> 01:17:58.628]  Mark, the President is super interesting, but I want to get into 9-11.
[01:17:58.948 --> 01:18:11.758]  I want to get into where you see the battle for the Republic, as you term it, going and what you think some of the strategies in the Info War, from your unique perspective, should be.
[01:18:12.896 --> 01:18:16.179]  Ladies and gentlemen, back from the dead, but he was never dead.
[01:18:16.239 --> 01:18:17.940]  He was in there writing several books.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.122]  He was in there getting a lot of material out.
[01:18:20.142 --> 01:18:23.264]  He even wrote me a letter that I've got on the wall at my home office.
[01:18:23.905 --> 01:18:26.847]  And it's just great to have Mark Kornke back out.
[01:18:27.187 --> 01:18:29.469]  You know they're going to try to plant guns on him or set him up.
[01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:31.551]  I know he's watching his six.
[01:18:33.878 --> 01:18:46.847]  If I was Mark, this is my advice, I would not lay low, but physically lay low, and then I would just basically communicate via the electronic grid and fight him inside the Matrix so they can't get his physical person.
[01:18:47.507 --> 01:18:51.370]  I'll just hook Mark's brain directly into the computer system.
[01:18:51.730 --> 01:18:52.491]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.476 --> 01:18:56.479]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:18:56.799 --> 01:19:01.723]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:19:01.983 --> 01:19:06.346]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:19:06.627 --> 01:19:15.534]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:19:15.754 --> 01:19:19.357]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:19:19.657 --> 01:19:24.704]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:19:24.985 --> 01:19:31.674]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:19:32.190 --> 01:19:32.851]  What about you?
[01:19:33.491 --> 01:19:38.855]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:19:42.078 --> 01:19:44.540]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:20:00.282 --> 01:20:05.125]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:20:05.325 --> 01:20:08.067]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:20:08.107 --> 01:20:09.207]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:20:10.568 --> 01:20:15.171]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:20:16.091 --> 01:20:23.356]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:20:24.356 --> 01:20:27.398]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Buck and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.

[01:20:53.723 --> 01:20:55.504]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:20:55.604 --> 01:20:56.865]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:59.927]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:03.050]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?

[01:21:53.397 --> 01:21:59.900]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:04.141]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[01:22:04.401 --> 01:22:06.542]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[01:22:06.902 --> 01:22:13.945]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[01:22:14.265 --> 01:22:16.866]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[01:22:17.127 --> 01:22:20.608]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[01:22:20.908 --> 01:22:28.798]  Nonex Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:22:29.179 --> 01:22:30.661]  It's also money back guarantee.
[01:22:30.961 --> 01:22:36.749]  You'll find Nonex Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid.
[01:22:37.089 --> 01:22:42.873]  Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[01:22:43.354 --> 01:22:45.635]  Or online at drugstore.com.
[01:22:46.056 --> 01:22:51.460]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[01:22:54.782 --> 01:23:05.490]  Ooh, I really should have built a wall.
[01:23:06.477 --> 01:23:07.678]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:07.698 --> 01:23:08.859]  Mark Coren, he's our guest.
[01:23:09.959 --> 01:23:21.727]  Mark, let's shift gears into the big picture, the overview, while you studied the press and the media and tuned into radio while you were behind the wire for seven years.
[01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:25.089]  I want to get into the books you've written while you were there and when those are going to be available.
[01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:27.411]  But just the big overview
[01:23:28.371 --> 01:23:31.312]  Why did the globalists, why did the New World Order carry out 9-11?
[01:23:32.993 --> 01:23:37.575]  What's the position with your take on the public and resistance and the awakening?
[01:23:37.895 --> 01:23:39.816]  What do you see the elite doing in the near future?
[01:23:39.856 --> 01:23:45.558]  Because everything they do now, instead of having a Midas touch, everything they touch turns to dog poo.
[01:23:46.038 --> 01:23:46.939]  I mean, literally, this
[01:23:48.619 --> 01:23:55.541]  Colleen Sheikh Mohammed thing, 95% in major polls, it was 74 last week, believe it's a lie and a cover-up.
[01:23:56.321 --> 01:23:58.421]  The public is believing nothing they say.
[01:23:58.761 --> 01:24:00.742]  Both parties are completely discredited now.
[01:24:01.442 --> 01:24:06.363]  We have seen the major shift that dwarfs the awakening that we saw in the early 1990s.
[01:24:06.803 --> 01:24:10.144]  Clearly the government carried out Oklahoma City to try to demonize the Patriot movement.
[01:24:10.624 --> 01:24:11.285]  Well, it's interesting.
[01:24:11.305 --> 01:24:14.767]  First of all, when you bring up the whole thing about September 11th,
[01:24:35.174 --> 01:24:38.535]  Just as we said, it was not a response.
[01:24:38.715 --> 01:24:40.315]  It was a reaction formula.
[01:24:40.895 --> 01:24:42.656]  Reaction implies knee-jerk.
[01:24:43.636 --> 01:24:51.118]  It was, in other words, damage-controlled because of a specific series of situations that were developing both inside and outside the United States.
[01:24:51.958 --> 01:24:58.159]  From inside, the communications base and the fact that they've been retarded in where they wanted to be by the year 2001, let alone 2007,
[01:25:01.992 --> 01:25:03.472]  That created a great crisis for them.
[01:25:03.492 --> 01:25:04.653]  They were behind schedule.
[01:25:04.673 --> 01:25:06.293]  This was an emergency jump start.
[01:25:06.353 --> 01:25:07.733]  Electricity directly to the heart.
[01:25:08.193 --> 01:25:08.674]  Exactly.
[01:25:08.774 --> 01:25:13.735]  In the past, or the normal policy, they obviously have set up a schedule many, many years ago.
[01:25:14.435 --> 01:25:23.017]  This schedule allowed for a specific Fabian-type response, which remember is gradualism, step-by-step, until you reach your goal.
[01:25:23.755 --> 01:25:28.556]  The problem is, and this is the basic rule, is nobody remembers second best.
[01:25:28.696 --> 01:25:30.177]  Nobody remembers number two.
[01:25:30.257 --> 01:25:39.059]  Nobody remembers the guy that's there before, or a couple of guys before they say the big kahuna, the big cheese, takes the golden ring.
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:41.280]  Somebody else wanted to do that.
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:49.382]  I believe that number one, the biggest problem you've got is that most of the regime, first of all, failed to surrender their catbird seat to the next generation.
[01:25:49.663 --> 01:25:51.023]  Most of them are getting very old.
[01:25:51.721 --> 01:25:53.022]  They can see the writing.
[01:25:53.042 --> 01:25:56.526]  They can see the possibility of getting what they want.
[01:25:57.807 --> 01:26:04.874]  But to do it, they have to still relax a bit and let somebody else take credit for what they've spent most of their lives doing.
[01:26:04.934 --> 01:26:11.120]  Now, they're not the only ones that were involved in this long chain of affairs that have developed this New World Order scam.
[01:26:12.021 --> 01:26:16.225]  But, again, they only make statues for the ones who perform the task.
[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:18.861]  Not for the number two, not for number three.
[01:26:19.161 --> 01:26:30.686]  The guy that's up there that has the ring in hand, when the time comes, if he can collapse the country, surrender us to the global plantation, plug the rest of the mechanism in, that's the one that's going to be remembered.
[01:26:31.326 --> 01:26:36.128]  On the other hand, outside, the other consideration is because the Patriot Movement bought time.
[01:26:37.209 --> 01:26:42.331]  The other side also had a series of issues and has a series of issues with alternatives because
[01:26:43.126 --> 01:26:49.211]  These windows of opportunity bring force and bring resource to a specific fixed point in time.
[01:26:49.231 --> 01:26:51.012]  And that's what we always tried to do.
[01:26:51.072 --> 01:26:56.997]  We always said we don't have to win right now, we have to block them, hold them back, frustrate them until they bog down.
[01:26:57.337 --> 01:27:10.987]  That's right, because the longer we stretch out the event, the more time that you have, the more likely a series of events will develop that will demonstrate exactly what's going on, or at least expose key elements.
[01:27:11.007 --> 01:27:11.868]  The unraveling.
[01:27:12.338 --> 01:27:18.739]  That's right, and what we're seeing right now especially, look what happened with September 11th as far as the after-the-fact collection of data.
[01:27:19.559 --> 01:27:37.883]  The one reason, the key reason that this type of fiasco, this type of skullduggery would fail, and especially in more modern times, is because you have a series of experts and trained professionals in a series of trades that demand absolute excellence.
[01:27:38.908 --> 01:27:43.291]  The three groups that you have the hardest time with are A. Air Traffic Controllers.
[01:27:43.691 --> 01:27:46.834]  They all know the truth and there's some of them listening right now.
[01:27:47.574 --> 01:27:48.675]  They know the truth.
[01:27:49.295 --> 01:27:57.141]  It is impossible for that scenario to have been played out unless absolute treason was involved and it had to be coming from Command and Control.
[01:27:57.861 --> 01:28:00.023]  I believe the Air Traffic Controllers did their job.
[01:28:00.663 --> 01:28:04.206]  I believe that the manager of the Air Traffic Controllers tried to do their job.
[01:28:04.795 --> 01:28:19.081]  But because of the nature of the creature that is right now, the creatures that are occupying Washington, there was a terror action by the government against their own people immediately after the fact, when it didn't go quite the way it was supposed to.
[01:28:19.101 --> 01:28:20.001]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:28:20.101 --> 01:28:22.142]  Let's continue with your take on this.
[01:28:22.582 --> 01:28:25.624]  Mark Cornyn, seven years behind the wire.
[01:28:26.124 --> 01:28:31.546]  Seven years in different state prisons, from maximum security down to medium security.
[01:28:32.370 --> 01:28:40.215]  The crime being run off the road by police and they were trying to set him up for a bank robbery, which was of course a complete lie.
[01:28:40.275 --> 01:28:40.975]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.657 --> 01:28:46.659]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.559 --> 01:28:50.341]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.583 --> 01:28:59.587]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:29:00.147 --> 01:29:01.388]  Globalists are concerned with what
[01:29:07.469 --> 01:29:09.631]  Poison of globalism is nationalism.

[01:29:57.303 --> 01:29:59.464]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:29:59.745 --> 01:30:09.834]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?

[01:31:01.764 --> 01:31:08.052]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[01:31:08.633 --> 01:31:18.541]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, You are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[01:31:19.022 --> 01:31:25.487]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness, and you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.

[01:32:05.203 --> 01:32:07.604]  Yeah, they build the airplanes.
[01:32:09.524 --> 01:32:11.485]  Yeah, they build all the bombs.
[01:32:13.865 --> 01:32:16.286]  Yeah, they hide behind walls.
[01:32:17.126 --> 01:32:20.147]  Yeah, they hide behind desks.
[01:32:22.428 --> 01:32:26.429]  I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
[01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:33.523]  Mark Cornkey is our guest.
[01:32:33.743 --> 01:32:37.889]  For those that don't know who he is, I'm going to give him a recap, a short bio.
[01:32:38.270 --> 01:32:45.300]  Before we go back to him, we're carrying four new films, Aftermath, Unanswered Questions from 9-11, by Guerrilla News Network.
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:48.462]  American Blackout, also by Grill News Network.
[01:32:48.502 --> 01:32:50.944]  Just focusing in on how blacks are blocked from voting.
[01:32:50.964 --> 01:32:51.904]  There's definitely no doubt.
[01:32:52.005 --> 01:32:52.685]  Very well done.
[01:32:53.105 --> 01:32:56.067]  Iraq for Sale, The War Profiteers by Robert Greenwald.
[01:32:56.508 --> 01:33:02.152]  Amazing film documenting how it's a war for profit for the New World Order and a lot more.
[01:33:03.172 --> 01:33:06.214]  Also, we're carrying America, Freedom to Fascism by Aaron Russo.
[01:33:06.715 --> 01:33:08.196]  My new film, Terror Storm.
[01:33:09.213 --> 01:33:12.855]  A history of government-sponsored terror really is the best film out there, bar none.
[01:33:13.255 --> 01:33:18.777]  Documenting government-sponsored terror, not just 9-11, but 7-7, and all the declassified admissions were criminals.
[01:33:19.337 --> 01:33:26.020]  Criminal elements in our government, criminal compartments, staged terror attacks worldwide as a pretext for their New World Order system.
[01:33:27.626 --> 01:33:36.371]  All of these videos are on discount at InfoWars.com via the safe secure online video and bookstore shopping cart or you can call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:33:38.552 --> 01:33:45.636]  You not only get great films that inform you, you can make copies of all the films I've made.
[01:33:45.656 --> 01:33:48.958]  Aaron Russo wants you to make copies of his film, Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[01:33:49.979 --> 01:33:52.280]  All of this is very very effective
[01:33:53.326 --> 01:33:56.887]  And you can make copies and force multiply that.
[01:33:57.807 --> 01:33:59.567]  And that's why 9-11 has been exposed.
[01:33:59.887 --> 01:34:01.488]  That's why the globalists are on the run.
[01:34:01.808 --> 01:34:04.948]  That's why everything they touch is turning to trash.
[01:34:05.468 --> 01:34:08.029]  Everything they touch is turning to dirt, to ashes.
[01:34:08.409 --> 01:34:12.130]  It's because you have taken action and all the glory goes to God.
[01:34:12.410 --> 01:34:21.752]  So I'm telling you out there who haven't gotten involved in the fight or those of you who've been in the fight but maybe think you made a hundred copies of Terror Storm or a hundred copies of Freedom to Fascism, you're done.
[01:34:21.852 --> 01:34:22.052]  No!
[01:34:22.372 --> 01:34:22.892]  Redouble!
[01:34:23.112 --> 01:34:24.133]  Then redouble again.
[01:34:24.173 --> 01:34:26.875]  Listen, I'm not tooting my horn.
[01:34:26.915 --> 01:34:30.438]  I'm doing this because I love my family, and I know it's about survival now.
[01:34:30.458 --> 01:34:33.080]  I mean, I've gotten pretty close to the tip of the spear on this.
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:34.201]  I've gotten deep into this.
[01:34:34.261 --> 01:34:35.482]  I'm past the point of no return.
[01:34:35.802 --> 01:34:37.984]  And we're all past that point, whether you realize it or not.
[01:34:38.444 --> 01:34:40.006]  The question is, will you face the truth?
[01:34:41.327 --> 01:34:48.873]  I mean, yesterday was kind of my day off, so I only worked about 11 hours yesterday.
[01:34:49.714 --> 01:34:52.095]  Saturday I worked close to 18.
[01:34:53.593 --> 01:34:55.294]  Friday I worked only about 15.
[01:34:56.255 --> 01:34:56.835]  And you know what?
[01:34:56.955 --> 01:34:57.756]  I enjoy it.
[01:34:57.816 --> 01:35:02.058]  I have to make myself go to bed at 1, 2 o'clock in the morning to get up at 7 in the morning.
[01:35:02.519 --> 01:35:07.682]  I have to do that because it is a total war, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:10.224]  These people put cancer viruses in vaccines.
[01:35:10.244 --> 01:35:11.965]  They run giant child kidnapping rings.
[01:35:12.285 --> 01:35:13.526]  It's now mainstream news.
[01:35:14.046 --> 01:35:16.027]  Mark and others told you about it 15 years ago, 20 years ago.
[01:35:18.178 --> 01:35:22.662]  I mean, we're fighting... Mark, I want to go through the experts in the system.
[01:35:22.682 --> 01:35:25.724]  We aren't going to go along with a lie, but also just the nature of evil.
[01:35:26.305 --> 01:35:36.733]  For the average person who doesn't want to kidnap and kill children, or who doesn't want to put cancer viruses in vaccines, you know, getting into the mindset of the elite and why they do this, but please continue.
[01:35:37.294 --> 01:35:38.695]  Okay, I want to take a second.
[01:35:38.755 --> 01:35:40.496]  I'll finish up on our last train of thought.
[01:35:41.017 --> 01:35:42.598]  I would like to qualify something.
[01:35:42.838 --> 01:35:45.941]  Remember this about these three particular fields.
[01:35:46.696 --> 01:35:49.597]  They do not measure time, per se, in hours.
[01:35:50.137 --> 01:35:55.439]  They measure time in tenths of a second, in seconds, and at the most, in minutes.
[01:35:56.219 --> 01:35:59.640]  Air traffic controllers are dealing with thousands of people's lives.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:01.841]  What's the one thing we know about air traffic controllers?
[01:36:02.381 --> 01:36:05.822]  That they are one of the most stressful jobs in the United States.
[01:36:06.382 --> 01:36:07.763]  They take their job seriously.
[01:36:07.863 --> 01:36:13.004]  They don't sell Starbucks coffee on the side and then come over and play air traffic controller for two hours a day.
[01:36:13.704 --> 01:36:15.745]  These men are immersed in their job.
[01:36:16.328 --> 01:36:20.329]  The FAA has what is called Standard Operating Procedure.
[01:36:20.429 --> 01:36:22.330]  They cannot deviate from.
[01:36:23.130 --> 01:36:25.871]  When they operate, there is a specific set pattern.
[01:36:26.271 --> 01:36:37.414]  They must follow through a page of operational procedures if they get into a specific crisis and they do not, they can't fall to the next page until they complete all of the tasks.
[01:36:38.074 --> 01:36:40.375]  Again, this is something that has been drilled into them.
[01:36:40.435 --> 01:36:42.115]  It's part of their regimented process.
[01:36:42.476 --> 01:36:43.876]  They are trained professionals.
[01:36:44.488 --> 01:36:46.009]  They deal in tenths of a second.
[01:36:46.069 --> 01:36:46.809]  Think about this.
[01:36:47.309 --> 01:36:48.570]  They know very quickly.
[01:36:48.610 --> 01:36:49.870]  They must know very quickly.
[01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:54.252]  There are 300 to 500 lives at stake if they make a mistake.
[01:36:54.692 --> 01:36:55.312]  If they fail.
[01:36:56.132 --> 01:36:59.173]  Now with that being the case, is there anybody?
[01:36:59.614 --> 01:37:06.516]  I would have to laugh, and in fact I would say you're a sorry soul to believe that for up to 20 minutes, excuse me.
[01:37:06.616 --> 01:37:07.957]  It was an hour and 20 minutes.
[01:37:08.057 --> 01:37:13.919]  An hour and 20 minutes, but let's say even for 10 minutes or 20 minutes, you're dealing in tenths of a second.
[01:37:14.582 --> 01:37:17.143]  In seconds, and in fact, even hundreds in some cases.
[01:37:17.183 --> 01:37:19.703]  Depends on what clock, who's running what clock.
[01:37:20.184 --> 01:37:23.625]  But the bottom line is, take a look at the timelines and how they're measured.
[01:37:24.285 --> 01:37:36.148]  Now, with that being the case... No, I've talked to on-air four or five air traffic controllers, and probably 15 or 20 at different events and places who are current and former, and they just say, total inside job, total bull.
[01:37:36.528 --> 01:37:39.389]  And they all know this, no matter who that professional is.
[01:37:39.409 --> 01:37:40.829]  There's one profession right there.
[01:37:40.849 --> 01:37:43.290]  Now, let's go to the next profession that's tied into this also.
[01:37:43.976 --> 01:37:46.436]  Pilots who fly the same aircraft.
[01:37:47.297 --> 01:37:49.817]  If you've ever flown... Alex, you've flown all over the place.
[01:37:49.837 --> 01:37:54.418]  How many times have you had a man who's a pilot sit next to you or somewhere near you on a plane?
[01:37:55.498 --> 01:37:57.298]  That's piggybacking to another location.
[01:37:58.959 --> 01:38:00.059]  A few times, not many.
[01:38:00.299 --> 01:38:00.679]  Man, okay.
[01:38:00.719 --> 01:38:07.160]  In my case, I've used this... Maybe you don't see as much because they're being more picky about them having the manuals out where people can see them.
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:10.561]  But if you're flying, say, or trying to get into flying a 757 or a 767,
[01:38:12.907 --> 01:38:14.968]  You are immersing yourself in the technology.
[01:38:14.988 --> 01:38:20.149]  Oh yeah, I've seen pilots lots of times sitting out in the lobbies with their computers out, their papers totally immersed, yeah.
[01:38:20.169 --> 01:38:23.230]  Victor, that's right, because they have to know a standard operating procedure.
[01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:27.292]  Thousands of, hundreds of switches with multiple positions, so thousands of choices.
[01:38:27.692 --> 01:38:41.436]  And the very thing that that air traffic controller does with many planes, that pilot and the co-pilot and possibly the navigator engineer, if the third man's on board, all have to deal and be of the same professional caliber.
[01:38:42.028 --> 01:38:43.809]  Now, I'm going to talk right into the radio again.
[01:38:43.889 --> 01:38:49.312]  How many of you pilots out there have been honest and acknowledged that you've seen the mistake here?
[01:38:49.832 --> 01:38:51.693]  That you understand that they're lying?
[01:38:52.133 --> 01:38:53.914]  Now, there's two professions right there.
[01:38:54.394 --> 01:38:58.916]  But now I'm going to go to the third one, because the third one is tied into those two, and that's the Air Force.
[01:38:59.777 --> 01:39:04.759]  There are virtually tens of thousands of pilots out there that are combat pilots.
[01:39:04.779 --> 01:39:10.002]  They're either combat experienced, or at the very least, they have been trained to fly sortes, missions,
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:13.722]  To engage or deal with specific threats to the United States.
[01:39:14.663 --> 01:39:21.328]  They know, just like these other two sets of professionals know, whether or not somebody is lying about a process.
[01:39:21.788 --> 01:39:24.590]  And they know that it is virtually impossible
[01:39:25.157 --> 01:39:26.398]  You don't even have to get into the other details.
[01:39:26.418 --> 01:39:37.842]  Well, Dr. Bob Bowman, the former head of the Star Wars program, fighter intercept pilot, fighter bomber, Vietnam, hundreds of missions, what, 103 missions, he said that it's a lie when they say nothing was done on 9-11.
[01:39:37.962 --> 01:39:47.547]  He says if nothing would have been done, the default position would have been in place, those planes would have been shot down, and 3,000 Americans would still be alive.
[01:39:47.827 --> 01:39:48.287]  Exactly.
[01:39:48.827 --> 01:40:06.387]  So the default position was removed and then lo and behold we even have the document June 3rd 2001 where Dick Cheney orders the Secretary of Defense to take NORAD's shoot down powers away but then we know that a general and we've got the award ceremony video by the way
[01:40:06.847 --> 01:40:07.447]  Refused.
[01:40:07.467 --> 01:40:20.915]  The Happy Hooligans were actually on maneuvers in Virginia then, but they got the order to put two AIM-9s, two Sidewinders, into that aircraft, and that's what the state police and others said was a big explosion, an 8.5 mile debris field.
[01:40:21.336 --> 01:40:21.816]  Exactly.
[01:40:21.836 --> 01:40:30.141]  The thing about it with these pilots is, remember, they know that in the last 30 days to 40 days, think about what happened just before September 11th.
[01:40:30.721 --> 01:40:34.703]  Remember that kid that tried to land his single-engine aircraft on the lawn of the White House?
[01:40:35.384 --> 01:40:35.624]  Yes.
[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:38.041]  That was only shortly before this.
[01:40:38.101 --> 01:40:41.964]  They even publicly acknowledged that because of that, they had reviewed.
[01:40:42.024 --> 01:41:00.517]  Now, we don't need to go into the details, but the people who are the professionals in the Air Force, and those who are in military or national defense, understand and know that there was a heightened state of preparedness because they had to evaluate and then strengthen specific issues, and perhaps even let this happen for that reason.
[01:41:01.075 --> 01:41:05.216]  The excuse was then to actually mobilize and improve the defense systems.
[01:41:05.596 --> 01:41:18.040]  Yet we're supposed to believe that all of a sudden, after an incident like that, and because of the fact that this is the capital of these United States, that all of a sudden somebody decided, I'm not going to be paying any attention to the radar.
[01:41:18.955 --> 01:41:20.276]  I'm not going to defend the country.
[01:41:20.436 --> 01:41:24.318]  I've got a second job at Starbucks in the next 25 minutes I've got to get to.
[01:41:24.599 --> 01:41:25.899]  Hey, let me know how things turn out.
[01:41:25.919 --> 01:41:26.940]  Well, we have the facts.
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.381]  We know that the government ran drills to confuse them.
[01:41:29.401 --> 01:41:36.586]  We have the air traffic controllers saying, I've never seen so much exercise going on during real world activities.
[01:41:37.186 --> 01:41:38.687]  They're going, what's going on?
[01:41:38.767 --> 01:41:40.108]  Is this part of the exercise?
[01:41:40.469 --> 01:41:45.473]  An exercise of flying hijacked jets into the very same targets at the exact same time.
[01:41:45.713 --> 01:41:46.693]  And the same thing on 7-7.
[01:41:47.254 --> 01:41:48.155]  They're running a drill.
[01:41:48.215 --> 01:41:53.519]  The government with a private consultancy of the exact same trains and bus being bombed at the exact same time.
[01:41:53.859 --> 01:41:57.702]  And we had a actuary of folks at an insurance company do it.
[01:41:58.102 --> 01:42:00.964]  It was something like 40-something trectogillion.
[01:42:01.965 --> 01:42:04.167]  That's 40-something zeros, folks.
[01:42:04.567 --> 01:42:05.548]  Yes, to one.
[01:42:06.774 --> 01:42:13.633]  I mean, that's many billions of times all the grains of sand in all the world, and of course they bootleg the attacks through this.
[01:42:15.066 --> 01:42:20.750]  Shifting gears into a wider view, give us your take on where the Globalists are now.
[01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:30.216]  We know from their own public documents they are now at least seven years behind, but it seems like since they got behind they just accelerated their program.
[01:42:30.456 --> 01:42:34.879]  They're kind of like a NASCAR who three laps towards the end is in second place.
[01:42:34.899 --> 01:42:40.483]  They want the pole position, but their tires are bald, their engines rattling, they're afraid to press the accelerator.
[01:42:40.703 --> 01:42:44.165]  Well look at it this way, does an addict ever admit to his addiction?
[01:42:44.245 --> 01:42:44.385]  No.
[01:42:44.425 --> 01:42:49.348]  Okay, we're dealing with the same types of types of sycophants as far as these people go.
[01:43:04.406 --> 01:43:14.254]  Their power trip, what they've committed to, how they've sold their souls, what it is that they worship and who they worship, as far as the dark side of the force, if we want to call it that.
[01:43:14.814 --> 01:43:20.699]  But the demons that they worship, they have embraced completely and they cannot turn away from.
[01:43:20.759 --> 01:43:27.804]  In their minds, I kind of like Faust, remember what he said, what the demon kept saying every time Faust came up with a, I think I want to break the deal.
[01:43:28.305 --> 01:43:32.568]  The demon would step forward and he would threaten him constantly, threaten him over and over again.
[01:43:33.010 --> 01:43:35.631]  And at the end, when he went to hell, the demon laughed at him.
[01:43:35.671 --> 01:43:37.652]  He said, at any time, you could have left us.
[01:43:38.532 --> 01:43:43.174]  At any time, you could have escaped us by calling on the authority of Jesus Christ.
[01:43:43.655 --> 01:43:44.615]  And you didn't do it.
[01:43:44.735 --> 01:43:46.236]  And now your soul is mine.
[01:43:46.456 --> 01:43:55.820]  Oh, by the way, at Bohemian Grove, when we snuck in there in 2000, they mix some Babylonian, and they mix some Canaanite stuff in, and some Druidic.
[01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:58.221]  But in it, it's from Faust.
[01:43:58.761 --> 01:44:23.476]  Where the one thing the demon couldn't lock in the box was false care, and he's always trying to kill care, lock it up, in that, in a Faustian ritual, they take the image of a child, they burn it, and that's care, and they kind of put their hoodoo on it, like a sacrifice, they're putting all the bad things they've done on, to not care, and not have the bad they do come back on them.
[01:44:23.496 --> 01:44:27.118]  And then I discovered, watching videos of Anton LaVey on YouTube,
[01:44:28.058 --> 01:44:37.665]  That the Church of Satan did mock sacrifices of children, but they said it was just as good because they imaged it as a child, and they put all their, you know, bad stuff on the child.
[01:44:37.945 --> 01:44:40.848]  I mean, this is sick, and George Bush and others go there, Mark.
[01:44:41.528 --> 01:44:41.968]  Exactly.
[01:44:42.089 --> 01:44:46.752]  One of the things to remember is, in their mind's eye, they don't care if you believe.
[01:44:47.653 --> 01:44:57.340]  If you go through the motions, if you follow practices, you are strengthening their environment, you are strengthening their persona.
[01:44:58.251 --> 01:45:01.833]  It's the same for them, you know, it's kind of like, okay, look at it this way.
[01:45:02.033 --> 01:45:06.094]  You're on the big sacrificial altar, the guy comes up with the obsidian knife.
[01:45:06.715 --> 01:45:09.416]  You scream out, but I don't believe in your religion!
[01:45:09.516 --> 01:45:13.978]  And the last thing you hear as he plunges it into your chest and rips out your heart is, I don't care.
[01:45:13.998 --> 01:45:19.180]  Exactly, they don't, and then they've convinced everybody to be atheists.
[01:45:20.383 --> 01:45:24.426]  You know, saying, well this doesn't matter, we don't want to hear about devil worship, it doesn't exist.
[01:45:24.866 --> 01:45:27.928]  Even if you don't believe in God and the devil, folks, the elite does.
[01:45:27.948 --> 01:45:29.409]  This is what makes the world go round.
[01:45:29.529 --> 01:45:31.590]  That's one of the problems and what they've been counting on.
[01:45:31.650 --> 01:45:36.033]  It's just like, there are two things that basically are part of the overall strategic formula.
[01:45:36.193 --> 01:45:45.079]  Number one, you're not supposed to, and the average person, and what you said earlier, it's absolutely true, the average person would not go out of his way
[01:45:45.942 --> 01:45:46.182]  Do you
[01:46:06.397 --> 01:46:08.979]  Even if that guy does have a problem, it doesn't affect me.
[01:46:08.999 --> 01:46:20.205]  In other words, if they're attacking a certain group of people, or if they're going through the motions to undermine the liberties of one person, I'm not supposed to worry about that, because it's that guy, not me, and it's not going to affect me.
[01:46:20.946 --> 01:46:28.711]  In reality, if you'll notice, they've always complained when we've demonstrated that there is an interlocking action that's taking place with all of society.
[01:46:29.471 --> 01:46:33.673]  That it doesn't just affect one strata, but it affects all stratas in the process.
[01:46:35.793 --> 01:46:38.235]  You've heard this repeated over and over again.
[01:46:38.255 --> 01:46:41.536]  You know, ignore the man behind the curtain is what we always joke about.
[01:46:41.996 --> 01:46:47.779]  But The Wizard of Oz perfectly portrays how they wanted to separate each person into one track.
[01:46:47.919 --> 01:46:50.920]  Each one had their own area of interest where their heart was born.
[01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:53.301]  With Dorothy it was going someplace.
[01:46:53.421 --> 01:46:56.522]  With the scarecrow, he wanted to have a mind.
[01:46:56.602 --> 01:47:00.204]  Each one, if you'll notice, was isolated, separated, and segregated.
[01:47:01.283 --> 01:47:08.008]  Now, what happened is, when the four of them came together and worked together, they were so much stronger than their aggressor.
[01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:11.211]  In fact, they overcame the great and powerful Oz.
[01:47:11.551 --> 01:47:15.534]  And by the way, Toto was the kicker to the whole thing, because as we know, he took Curtin out of the way.
[01:47:16.317 --> 01:47:18.458]  The little dog damages everything else.
[01:47:18.518 --> 01:47:18.978]  That's right.
[01:47:19.038 --> 01:47:21.239]  And everything was there, but it was integrated.
[01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:32.965]  It was a combined force, a combined arms team, so to speak, that actually faced off against what they perceived to be the ultimate strength, when in reality... Now, the globalists are arrogant.
[01:47:33.005 --> 01:47:44.651]  The phenomenon of shelf-made documentaries like Road to Tyranny, Terror Storm, you, Mark, of course, pioneered with those talks you gave, America in Peril, but the burgeoning where you can make a film
[01:47:45.171 --> 01:47:49.113]  Put it out on the web for free, something the globalists would never do, because they're all about money and power.
[01:47:49.493 --> 01:47:53.755]  Have 30, 50, 100 million people watch one film.
[01:47:54.255 --> 01:47:56.436]  That is bringing them to their knees.
[01:47:56.556 --> 01:48:02.759]  Now, I wish they still were filled with the hubris, but I do now see fear in their eyes, Mark.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:12.644]  Well, I think that's one of the things, when you ask where would this go, okay, and again, you guys out there, while we were inside, I think everybody came to the same conclusion, if we've been doing this for some time.
[01:48:13.455 --> 01:48:16.378]  Is they have to fabricate another crisis, but how do we do this?
[01:48:16.558 --> 01:48:20.021]  The old Wicked Witch said, these things must be done delicately.
[01:48:20.041 --> 01:48:21.783]  Well, that's exactly the case.
[01:48:21.943 --> 01:48:29.690]  And so now the problem is, it has to be so catastrophic that there will be no time to respond.
[01:48:29.710 --> 01:48:32.733]  Now, it's not true that that would be the case.
[01:48:33.454 --> 01:48:36.837]  Even if, and this is the most likely scenario, everybody's painted it out,
[01:48:37.563 --> 01:48:40.224]  But a nuclear strike, and not a missile strike.
[01:48:40.244 --> 01:48:43.165]  It'll be walked in, and it won't be walked in necessarily over the border.
[01:48:43.285 --> 01:48:45.386]  I think it'll come in probably by container ship.
[01:48:46.206 --> 01:48:52.808]  The reason for that, or a simple freighter of some kind, but a container, a lesser container freighter.
[01:48:52.848 --> 01:48:54.129]  It doesn't even have to make it in.
[01:48:54.149 --> 01:48:56.689]  A ship can just get within a mile of New York.
[01:48:56.750 --> 01:48:59.991]  Right, it's got, well, I know, okay, let's go through this.
[01:49:00.211 --> 01:49:02.031]  I've worked as, you know, you've mentioned backgrounds.
[01:49:02.171 --> 01:49:04.832]  I worked as a 94B20 intelligence analyst.
[01:49:04.912 --> 01:49:06.693]  I was also a counterintelligence NCO.
[01:49:07.569 --> 01:49:12.831]  And I worked as a security officer with the G2 Shop.
[01:49:13.972 --> 01:49:15.012]  I was school-trained.
[01:49:15.553 --> 01:49:24.296]  I was 13th out of a class of 33 and the second highest to graduate in my particular MOS at USECS, United States Army Centers and Schools.
[01:49:25.337 --> 01:49:27.258]  I'm a school-trained USECS, by the way.
[01:49:27.298 --> 01:49:32.220]  I'm a school-trained intelligence analyst, which is kind of rare.
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:36.902]  It's not super rare, but the average person who is put into an intelligence post
[01:49:37.757 --> 01:49:43.464]  Typically, in middle and upper management even, are people who are looking for retirement points.
[01:49:44.004 --> 01:49:44.605]  Stay there, Mark.
[01:49:44.625 --> 01:49:45.126]  We got a break.
[01:49:45.166 --> 01:49:46.387]  We'll come back and explain all this.
[01:49:46.828 --> 01:49:51.393]  Get into the globalist next move, which will be some type of bio or nuclear attack.

[01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:59.682]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:51:00.022 --> 01:51:01.964]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:51:02.324 --> 01:51:09.969]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:10.672 --> 01:51:17.716]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:18.116 --> 01:51:29.542]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:51:29.862 --> 01:51:33.464]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:51:33.804 --> 01:51:35.745]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:51:36.085 --> 01:51:39.927]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:29.138]  Yeah, we shot the sheriff, but we didn't get the deputy.
[01:53:29.718 --> 01:53:30.418]  We're not done.
[01:53:30.438 --> 01:53:31.559]  This battle goes on.
[01:53:32.239 --> 01:53:33.520]  But we are having an effect.
[01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:36.862]  Eighty-four percent of Americans believe they're being lied to about 9-11.
[01:53:36.902 --> 01:53:40.784]  In an earlier poll, thirty-six percent believe total inside job with eighty
[01:53:41.484 --> 01:53:46.507]  Excuse me, with 68% of those respondents believing there's a cover-up in the Scripps Howard News Service poll.
[01:53:46.807 --> 01:53:57.472]  And if you study polling science, most people will get a phone call saying, this is Scripps Howard News Service with the Ohio Poll Survey, Ohio University Poll Survey.
[01:53:58.572 --> 01:54:00.253]  You believe the government carried out the attacks.
[01:54:00.974 --> 01:54:04.935]  With controversial questions, most people will answer with the non-controversial.
[01:54:05.976 --> 01:54:08.057]  Okay, so it's probably double that number.
[01:54:09.146 --> 01:54:10.107]  We are winning.
[01:54:10.147 --> 01:54:15.010]  We are having an effect, ladies and gentlemen, and we're not going to stop.
[01:54:15.831 --> 01:54:27.418]  Mark, we were talking during the break, and it's an important point to add that by exposing government-sponsored terror, I remember when it happened, the day it happened, I went on air and laid it out, and that
[01:54:28.956 --> 01:54:38.742]  It took a lot of nerve to do, but we had to do it because, I mean, when I first said it, it was like I had five heads from Mars, but it had to be done.
[01:54:39.283 --> 01:54:44.666]  And of course, you know, months before, we laid out the fact they'd probably attack the World Trade Center, use their asset bin Laden to take the blame.
[01:54:45.567 --> 01:54:47.008]  Let's talk about that.
[01:54:47.448 --> 01:54:51.330]  By exposing government-sponsored terror, more eyes are open, aren't they, Mark?
[01:54:51.731 --> 01:54:55.053]  Yes, the biggest problem they've got, and everybody needs to think this way,
[01:54:56.491 --> 01:55:02.855]  The more people you have observing, the harder it is for, and the description I would use is, the pickpocket or the magician.
[01:55:03.516 --> 01:55:05.737]  It's harder for them to maintain the illusion.
[01:55:06.317 --> 01:55:14.202]  Now, here's the biggest problem, is not only do you have to deal with everybody, but you have to deal with many trained professionals in many different professions.
[01:55:14.863 --> 01:55:23.648]  The more intricate an action, especially in modern times, where you involve specific technologies, the more you're going to have difficulty in
[01:55:24.301 --> 01:55:34.049]  In baffling somebody with BS, if they're in the field or if they're affiliated with the field and have a working knowledge of it in some way, now there will always be shills.
[01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:44.378]  There will always be some group of shysters who will be willing to sell their soul and will provide whatever words are needed to try and do damage control.
[01:55:44.518 --> 01:55:45.179]  Think about that.
[01:55:45.219 --> 01:55:47.100]  You've already seen this in the printing industry.
[01:55:47.581 --> 01:55:51.544]  We see this with key individuals who have large government contracts
[01:55:52.102 --> 01:55:56.277]  But even there, you have a lot of people, even though they've had large government contracts...
[01:55:56.721 --> 01:55:59.862]  They've openly said that they've seen through the charade.
[01:56:00.282 --> 01:56:05.764]  Because from their professional perspective, they understand how the technology and the business work.
[01:56:05.785 --> 01:56:06.985]  Let me add a point here, Mark.
[01:56:07.825 --> 01:56:12.127]  First, they had Khalid Sheikh Mohammed confess to carrying out the 93 bombing.
[01:56:12.167 --> 01:56:13.447]  It's now admitted he had nothing to do with it.
[01:56:13.748 --> 01:56:18.009]  To bombing, trying to bomb a bank that didn't even exist until three years after he was arrested.
[01:56:18.029 --> 01:56:22.471]  To being behind everything, you know, except for the Kennedy assassination.
[01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:31.350]  Secret arrest, secret torture, you can't believe any confession, you know, A, that's garnered under those circumstances in that atmosphere.
[01:56:31.731 --> 01:56:36.056]  Then you have the neocons caught lying about WMDs, everything else.
[01:56:36.496 --> 01:56:38.659]  Well, that didn't work, so now, just out.
[01:56:38.759 --> 01:56:41.623]  Detainee confesses to USS Cole bombing.
[01:56:42.441 --> 01:56:49.344]  Associated Press, Waleed bin Attasha, a suspected key Al-Qaeda operative, confessed to plotting the bombings of the USS Cole.
[01:56:50.004 --> 01:57:00.769]  They must be getting really desperate now that people they've been holding for four or five years are suddenly spilling, or they're releasing the spilled guts from inside these tortured black hole camps.
[01:57:01.029 --> 01:57:05.271]  I mean, if they grab me and put me in a secret camp, folks, and four years later they march me out,
[01:57:05.991 --> 01:57:09.434]  Uh, you know, with a shaved head to say, you know, that I stole the Lindbergh baby.
[01:57:09.694 --> 01:57:10.795]  Folks, it ain't true.
[01:57:11.095 --> 01:57:16.079]  You can't, I mean, Mark, when we get back, let's talk about just, it's prima facie.
[01:57:16.139 --> 01:57:18.301]  You can't believe anything a government does that tortures.
[01:57:18.321 --> 01:57:18.881]  Can you, Mark?
[01:57:19.081 --> 01:57:20.262]  Okay, let me explain something.
[01:57:20.302 --> 01:57:22.985]  I, when I worked as an intel analyst... Well, stay there.
[01:57:23.025 --> 01:57:26.147]  Let's finish up with the intel analyst stuff you were talking about before the last break.
[01:57:26.327 --> 01:57:31.071]  We'll be back in 70 seconds with the third hour with Mark Kornke and your calls.
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:37.962]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.678 --> 01:57:50.318]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.979 --> 01:57:52.059]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:53.901]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.521 --> 01:57:55.342]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.083 --> 01:57:56.963]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.983 --> 01:58:01.567]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.847 --> 01:58:05.931]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.538 --> 01:58:17.920]  Alright, I have Steven Marshall from Gorilla News Network coming on this hour.
[01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:18.760]  We just cancelled him.
[01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:19.521]  I appreciate him.
[01:58:20.001 --> 01:58:21.362]  Rescheduling to Wednesday.
[01:58:21.862 --> 01:58:23.483]  We carry two of his films.
[01:58:24.714 --> 01:58:35.099]  But it's just so great to be talking to Mark again, and I hope Mark will stay with us for the rest of the show, because I want to open the phones up this hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:35.199 --> 01:58:38.860]  Mark Kornkeep, again for the stations that just joined us, some just carried the third hour.
[01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:43.362]  Recap who you are, you just got out from behind the lines, and then we were talking about torture.
[01:58:43.422 --> 01:58:47.704]  How on the face of it can you believe any confession of people who've been in secret
[01:58:48.905 --> 01:58:50.026]  We're good to go.
[01:59:05.104 --> 01:59:05.564]  No, I don't.
[01:59:23.829 --> 01:59:26.832]  And said, we will torture your children.
[01:59:27.132 --> 01:59:29.794]  How in the world have we turned into this?
[01:59:29.814 --> 01:59:37.019]  And again, shows like Jack Bauer 24, they're introducing us to evil, conditioning us, the psychopaths are asking us to join them.
[01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:38.481]  Mark Kornke, lead into this.
[01:59:39.081 --> 01:59:52.872]  Exactly, you know, interesting reason I brought up the fact, when I was at USECS, I was associated with people who were counterintelligence personnel, and we also worked with the interrogators, and we received a certain number of classes on interrogation.
[01:59:53.961 --> 02:00:01.735]  One of the first things that was emphasized by men of quality who knew what they were doing... Is to be nice to people, not to torture them.
[02:00:01.855 --> 02:00:06.063]  Well, the first rule is, if you resort to violence, you have failed.
[02:00:07.188 --> 02:00:08.168]  That was their words.
[02:00:08.429 --> 02:00:12.771]  If you resort, think about this, if you resort to violence, you have failed.
[02:00:13.331 --> 02:00:16.552]  But that's if you want a real confession or real intel.
[02:00:16.812 --> 02:00:20.594]  If you just want somebody to spill the beans with bull, the torture works.
[02:00:20.694 --> 02:00:21.755]  Well, that's there again.
[02:00:21.775 --> 02:00:23.115]  Okay, what is the purpose?
[02:00:23.155 --> 02:00:33.540]  First of all, what is the purpose behind an intelligence gathering mechanism is to come up with viable material that can be used by your combat arm to execute a more efficient action so that they survive the action.
[02:00:34.585 --> 02:00:41.450]  On the other hand, if again you're trying to baffle everybody with BS, and you know the term that would be used, then exactly that's the point.
[02:00:41.870 --> 02:00:46.634]  You're going to get whatever that person thinks you want to hear to end the pain.
[02:00:47.094 --> 02:00:57.202]  If you continue to induce pain, they are going to rattle off things that they, and it won't be factual, it'll be whatever they feel by their physiological response observing you.
[02:00:58.243 --> 02:01:00.885]  That they're going to decide what they're going to decide to say.
[02:01:00.965 --> 02:01:01.865]  Keep that in mind.
[02:01:02.325 --> 02:01:05.507]  That's one of the basic rules about torture is they're going to be... That's 101!
[02:01:06.248 --> 02:01:06.408]  That's 101!
[02:01:07.448 --> 02:01:09.689]  Despite what everybody thinks, you're not shut off.
[02:01:09.749 --> 02:01:10.390]  Just the reverse.
[02:01:10.410 --> 02:01:12.971]  You're completely cognizant of your surroundings.
[02:01:12.991 --> 02:01:17.054]  You can see exactly what kind of evil is in the eyes of the people that are doing this.
[02:01:17.494 --> 02:01:22.937]  And I don't care which side they claim they're on, the bottom line is that if you look throughout our history,
[02:01:23.484 --> 02:01:27.968]  We have argued and we have fought vigorously to maintain the high ground.
[02:01:28.188 --> 02:01:28.909]  Against torture?
[02:01:29.229 --> 02:01:37.977]  Against torture and against, and again, that doesn't mean you can't control people every second, every minute, every moment of every day or every second of every minute.
[02:01:38.638 --> 02:01:44.143]  But the point is that as a standard, we maintain the high ground.
[02:01:44.750 --> 02:01:53.993]  What has happened is these creatures have dragged our country, have dragged... Well, people who truly were genuinely concerned about this country... They've taken us to incredible depths!
[02:01:54.093 --> 02:01:56.094]  They've taken us beyond the toilet, that's right.
[02:01:56.134 --> 02:01:57.794]  They've taken us through the septic field.
[02:01:57.815 --> 02:01:59.255]  We're down into the dark dungeons.
[02:01:59.275 --> 02:01:59.775]  And the problem is...
[02:02:02.396 --> 02:02:02.957]  They don't know!
[02:02:02.977 --> 02:02:03.337]  That's the thing!
[02:02:03.357 --> 02:02:04.437]  They're a bunch of chicken-necked, old, grimy
[02:02:20.828 --> 02:02:31.553]  Again, and it's like Richard Perle, it was in a news article, saddled up to some good-looking female reporter, I think it was the Washington Post, and bragged to her about how he has power to bomb people.
[02:02:32.053 --> 02:02:36.575]  I mean, folks who've really, you know, done things, it's not enjoyable.
[02:02:36.616 --> 02:02:43.499]  But again, exactly, they're a bunch of chicken-necked, cowardly, weak people who think it's tough to kill innocents and torture.
[02:02:45.769 --> 02:02:50.991]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:02:51.151 --> 02:02:59.235]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:02:59.495 --> 02:03:06.538]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:03:06.718 --> 02:03:07.999]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:03:08.079 --> 02:03:13.984]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:03:14.184 --> 02:03:19.268]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:03:19.388 --> 02:03:28.256]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:03:28.516 --> 02:03:31.818]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:03:42.545 --> 02:03:53.872]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:54.232 --> 02:04:01.797]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.563 --> 02:04:09.608]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:10.028 --> 02:04:21.455]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.755 --> 02:04:25.278]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.718 --> 02:04:27.679]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.979 --> 02:04:31.762]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:47.256 --> 02:04:51.399]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:04:51.620 --> 02:04:53.381]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:04:53.641 --> 02:04:59.926]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:05:00.226 --> 02:05:06.351]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:05:06.592 --> 02:05:08.353]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:05:08.393 --> 02:05:08.713]  I think so.

[02:05:49.141 --> 02:05:52.003]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:54.944 --> 02:05:59.266]  Coming up in about 10 minutes, we're going to open the phones up, the balance of the hour, with Mark Cornky.
[02:05:59.306 --> 02:06:03.248]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, here Monday through Friday, 11 to 2, Central Standard Time.
[02:06:03.288 --> 02:06:05.129]  Don't forget the free podcast we offer.
[02:06:05.569 --> 02:06:09.391]  Every day it serves up free to your MP3 or iPod device.
[02:06:09.471 --> 02:06:12.152]  Just go click subscribe and tell folks!
[02:06:12.592 --> 02:06:13.193]  We're good to go.
[02:06:42.692 --> 02:06:50.177]  Mark, I know that while you were in prison you probably read about it and heard about it, and I bring this up every other day on the show because it's such a big news item, I'll never shut up.
[02:06:51.217 --> 02:07:11.470]  Well actually, you'd be amazed, and you're seeing it, but it's interesting that for an isolated population, everybody has their opinion, and everybody is pretty much up to speed, and I'm talking about some pretty unique individuals here, but also a lot of people that if they're behind the wire or behind the wall, actually they're pretty sharp,
[02:07:12.239 --> 02:07:31.465]  They eyeball people, they pay attention to physiology, the way people respond just like anybody else does, and they read the bodies, they read the body language of the characters that are actually... And by the way, everybody's got the instinctive understanding of body language, just most people aren't conscious to your... I mean, 90% of communication is non-verbal.
[02:07:31.945 --> 02:07:37.707]  But Mark, going back, just finishing up the statement I was making, I bring this up continually,
[02:07:38.544 --> 02:07:48.297]  Because it's such a big deal that the current Attorney General, his Chief Counsel, and his deputy John Yoo, Alberto Gonzalez and John Yoo, in trouble for illegal spying and telling U.S.
[02:07:48.357 --> 02:07:53.104]  Attorneys to prosecute people who were innocent and all the rest of it, for political gain.
[02:07:54.201 --> 02:08:02.323]  would write a memo saying the president is above the law and would write a memo saying they can torture children with pliers sexually.
[02:08:02.823 --> 02:08:08.345]  I mean, when they write stuff, I mean, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, they never wrote stuff like that on paper, they just did it.
[02:08:08.865 --> 02:08:13.906]  Why did they think they could get away with that, or was that an attempt to lower the bar so low
[02:08:15.227 --> 02:08:18.430]  I mean, that just reeks of psychological warfare.
[02:08:18.450 --> 02:08:21.753]  If they can take us to hell, there's no way we can climb out of it.
[02:08:21.773 --> 02:08:34.806]  I mean, how do they write memos that are public, saying that they like to torture children with pliers, then it comes out in the Army's own report from Abu Ghraib, it comes out on the CIA base, inside X-Ray, a camp within a camp,
[02:08:35.346 --> 02:08:37.547]  Well, I think, number one, in the past we saw refinement.
[02:08:37.567 --> 02:08:46.510]  One of the things to remember is that there are key players here who in the past, mostly in the Fabian Socialist circles, you've got a combination of groups here, but you saw refinement and the concept of subtlety.
[02:09:04.306 --> 02:09:09.309]  What you have is a crudeness based upon the ineptness of those who are in charge.
[02:09:09.869 --> 02:09:20.095]  This is the kind of skullduggery, but also the kind of blatant propaganda to terrorize the population that the American colonial population saw in 1765 through 1775.
[02:09:21.275 --> 02:09:29.780]  In fact, even during the American Revolution, you know, they were giving the Hessian soldiers pamphlets that said that everybody over here they were fighting were werewolves.
[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:31.781]  I don't know if you've probably seen some of it.
[02:09:31.821 --> 02:09:32.702]  Take a look at some of it.
[02:09:32.722 --> 02:09:33.302]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:09:34.381 --> 02:09:38.344]  Again, anybody, well of course, their thought was, well maybe they're telling the truth!
[02:09:38.865 --> 02:09:41.107]  You know, at least get them to fight for a little bit.
[02:09:41.147 --> 02:09:56.382]  The problem is, when you have to face the human beings that they're trying to vilify, and you find out that everything, you know, again, the lies only work so far, but when they realize the lie, you will never be fooled again, and the actions will not be the same.
[02:09:56.422 --> 02:09:58.284]  They might try to cow you along for a bit,
[02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:05.271]  But now, you know, the curtains are already pulled away, the glasses are on, and you can see that the aliens are there, you know, they lived.
[02:10:05.291 --> 02:10:07.434]  You know, they live, it works the same way.
[02:10:08.996 --> 02:10:21.600]  The mistake now is, and again it's a desperation, the drowning man trying to drag somebody down along with him because he knows he can't swim and chances are in his case, or in this case with these characters, nobody's going to go out of their way to save them now.
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:33.483]  I think it's also an attempt to terrorize, that they know people who still have a moral compass will be frightened by attorney generals saying that sexually torturing children is good.
[02:10:34.327 --> 02:10:35.649]  And folks, that's what they've done!
[02:10:35.689 --> 02:10:36.609]  I mean, that's real!
[02:10:37.010 --> 02:10:38.892]  That's mainstream news!
[02:10:38.952 --> 02:10:39.973]  I mean, what's next?
[02:10:40.313 --> 02:10:47.080]  You're talking about a term, really, this is what they used to call in Western Civ, when you used to take the course, it used to be called the Byzantine Corruption.
[02:10:48.101 --> 02:10:49.082]  That is what you're seeing.
[02:10:49.122 --> 02:10:50.443]  This is not new to history.
[02:10:50.903 --> 02:10:55.528]  It's just new to America that we would have these types of scurrilous creatures coming in,
[02:10:56.169 --> 02:11:01.352]  And destroying the foundation of our form, our forms that existed here in the United States.
[02:11:01.692 --> 02:11:16.719]  But it's not an accident, because again, they have vilified the core morals, they've attacked the fact that, you know, the foundational mechanism that our nation is based upon, and that was intentional, that's all part of this pressure from within, pressure from without, as we know.
[02:11:17.679 --> 02:11:24.783]  Right now, the very fact that they're as petty as they are in making these public statements, or allowing them to be made,
[02:11:25.362 --> 02:11:27.863]  Should tell us something about where they're going.
[02:11:27.943 --> 02:11:36.967]  In other words, if this is as far as they'll go right now, that they'll admit to, I argue that they're already around the corner, and they're around the corner so far they can't see it anymore.
[02:11:37.688 --> 02:11:48.553]  I believe that, again, remember, just like Abu Ghraib, remember what they said, there's a hundred videos that we never saw, that they thought, that they even admitted, if the American people saw this,
[02:11:52.677 --> 02:12:16.224]  We got the mild stuff they decided to release, because CBS and total black ops folks learned this stuff was about to come out, so they put out the light stuff, but in the Army report, the Filipino American General's report to Gumbo, it says, raping children, raping women, in front of their husbands, with devices gripping with acid.
[02:12:17.051 --> 02:12:24.975]  Well, and the problem I have with this is, is what did they hope to gain other than, and this is what I, when you said, this is what we call the plan for failure scenario.
[02:12:25.856 --> 02:12:40.924]  The only people that are going to really get hurt, well obviously the people being tortured, but for everybody out there who has a son or a daughter that's over in Iraq, you tell me what that's going to create other than a whole bunch of people that are really, really, really going to want to kill Americans.
[02:12:41.826 --> 02:12:49.770]  That's the bottom line to what they're doing because if any of those people, and again remember, they still have family over there, they still have that family unit concept.
[02:12:50.190 --> 02:12:51.951]  Americans have been sovietized.
[02:12:52.131 --> 02:12:54.833]  Let me expand on that because you just hit the nail on the head.
[02:12:55.993 --> 02:13:01.796]  The CIA section chief over the Afghanistan operation went public two years ago.
[02:13:01.917 --> 02:13:02.917]  We already knew this.
[02:13:04.158 --> 02:13:10.181]  It had been in some German and British and Iranian papers, but it's now MSNBC admitted
[02:13:11.288 --> 02:13:24.718]  Tens of thousands, because there's camps in Poland, camps in Saudi Arabia, camps in Afghanistan, camps of course over in Egypt and Jordan and just all over the place, Hungary.
[02:13:26.139 --> 02:13:34.846]  Tens of thousands, they would tell whole tribes of literal goat herders, come down, there's a free roasting of a calf, and they love beef, they never get it.
[02:13:35.538 --> 02:13:59.331]  And they would come down to eat it, and then there would be C-130s at a nearby airport, they would just load whole families, all the men, ages 9 and up, totally innocent, and our government knowingly tortured innocents, then they let them go to go tell the story, and it's meant to make Iraq and Afghanistan break down, so they can then say, oh see, it's falling apart, we've got to stay there.
[02:13:59.731 --> 02:13:59.891]  Right.
[02:13:59.931 --> 02:14:02.373]  It would make the situation totally intangible.
[02:14:02.413 --> 02:14:03.293]  And here's the problem.
[02:14:03.313 --> 02:14:07.075]  We've already seen where they were capturing personnel who disguised themselves as Shiites.
[02:14:07.576 --> 02:14:10.938]  We can assume that they've also been doing this, disguising themselves as Sunnis.
[02:14:11.478 --> 02:14:14.960]  We know that there are other foreign assets that have been doing this for a number of years.
[02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:15.621]  They've caught U.S.
[02:14:15.661 --> 02:14:21.744]  Marines dressed up as Arabs, SAS, British Special Forces, and Israelis, even shooting our own Marines.
[02:14:21.924 --> 02:14:22.405]  Exactly.
[02:14:22.625 --> 02:14:27.988]  And here's the problem is, all your listeners out there, everybody right now that's got their ear to that radio,
[02:14:28.709 --> 02:14:35.354]  Your son, your daughter, your grandson, your granddaughter are being intentionally put into a shooting gallery.
[02:14:36.375 --> 02:14:40.278]  Colonel Hackworth, remember, warned everybody about this, what was going to happen years ago.
[02:14:40.298 --> 02:14:45.022]  We're going to a country like this, we're going to drive around in circles until somebody shoots at us.
[02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:49.191]  Everybody jumps out of the vehicle and kills everybody else but the person who pulled the trigger.
[02:14:49.671 --> 02:14:51.632]  Or at least beats the snot out of them.
[02:14:51.672 --> 02:14:53.353]  They keep screaming, Where's Osama?
[02:14:53.413 --> 02:14:54.133]  Where's Osama?
[02:14:54.173 --> 02:14:55.013]  We know what you're doing.
[02:14:55.033 --> 02:14:55.714]  Where's Osama?
[02:14:55.734 --> 02:15:13.902]  Well, they don't understand any English, but they heard the word Osama, and as soon as you jump back in your Humvees and run back to headquarters because you're terrified of getting shot at again, well, that guy, as soon as you let go of his collar, he's going to run back into the neighborhood or run back into the hills, look for that guy Osama, if that's who it is, and he's going to join him.
[02:15:14.784 --> 02:15:15.424]  It's that simple.
[02:15:15.524 --> 02:15:16.344]  So then what happens?
[02:15:16.384 --> 02:15:27.586]  You all hide back in your fire base, you wait a little bit, you run back out, you drive around in circles until you get shot at by a whole bunch of people again, and you grab a whole bunch of other people that have absolutely nothing to do with it.
[02:15:27.986 --> 02:15:32.247]  We have a combat force in a situation that should be a policing operation.
[02:15:32.507 --> 02:15:42.029]  And by the way, the first thing, and the generals said don't do this, and Bush would just relieve them of command, what like eight different generals, they said get the power and water on,
[02:15:43.268 --> 02:15:46.971]  Pull out in six weeks and they loved us, but no, they said, uh-uh.
[02:15:47.432 --> 02:15:54.437]  And they made the generals disband the entire state apparatchik by design.
[02:15:54.578 --> 02:15:59.942]  Then the CIA and others, the Israelis, started carrying out targeted attacks on Sunni against Shiite.
[02:16:00.583 --> 02:16:05.407]  Shiite against Sunni to get the ball rolling, blowing up mosques, caught red-handed.
[02:16:05.647 --> 02:16:07.268]  I mean, this is so diabolical.
[02:16:08.009 --> 02:16:10.391]  And the biggest problem that we have is this.
[02:16:10.411 --> 02:16:11.772]  The populations themselves
[02:16:12.482 --> 02:16:24.990]  And I really do believe, even for all the skullduggery that took place in the ten years that we've been waging war on Iraq, there are a lot of people there who still had the attitude that, okay, we'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
[02:16:25.410 --> 02:16:29.113]  Now, there is a picture that's painted differently from reality.
[02:16:29.173 --> 02:16:37.138]  I tell you what, if you get a chance, take a look at some of the combat footage that was covered by the Canadians in their interviews with this invasion that took place when we went into Iraq.
[02:16:37.799 --> 02:16:46.765]  The whole of the population was armed, and even if they didn't really have a great love for Saddam, and we could argue that I think there's a lot of people who really appreciated Hussein for what he was.
[02:16:46.785 --> 02:16:56.031]  You know, for what he was able to do to keep the country together, which is, as we see now, has been almost impossible and will not take place.
[02:16:56.051 --> 02:17:01.655]  There's going to be three countries, or at least three states separate there, that are divided, and they're divided naturally.
[02:17:02.335 --> 02:17:03.196]  Because of that,
[02:17:03.689 --> 02:17:10.293]  Hussein held the situation together, and he did it with a government that was more like ours than any other government in the Middle East.
[02:17:11.074 --> 02:17:11.874]  Everybody knows that.
[02:17:11.914 --> 02:17:14.396]  And that's what the globalists didn't like.
[02:17:14.476 --> 02:17:16.117]  They didn't want a strong Arab leader.
[02:17:16.537 --> 02:17:16.777]  Right.
[02:17:16.837 --> 02:17:18.838]  In fact, everybody claims he was secular.
[02:17:18.898 --> 02:17:27.664]  He was an individual who actually had... He had Jewish people, he had Christian people, he had Shias and he had Shiites throughout his government.
[02:17:28.470 --> 02:17:29.993]  There's no other country like that.
[02:17:30.053 --> 02:17:35.603]  Go any, turn anywhere direction, north, south, east, or west, and show me where anybody else is like that, that we're sucking up to.
[02:17:35.723 --> 02:17:37.105]  And that's why they set him up.
[02:17:37.406 --> 02:17:41.333]  That's why they set him up to attack Iran and then pull the rug out from under him.
[02:17:45.655 --> 02:17:48.536]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:17:48.876 --> 02:17:51.757]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:17:51.977 --> 02:17:58.179]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:18:45.052 --> 02:18:47.034]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:18:47.134 --> 02:18:47.574]  It's March 19, 2007.
[02:18:47.634 --> 02:18:48.214]  Gold is at $652.40.
[02:18:48.534 --> 02:18:51.976]  And one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $675.65, $334.72 for half, $170.19 for quarter ounce coins at $675.75, $334.72, and $170.19.
[02:19:04.623 --> 02:19:08.244]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[02:19:08.304 --> 02:19:11.326]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[02:19:11.426 --> 02:19:20.549]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[02:19:20.869 --> 02:19:26.191]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[02:19:26.671 --> 02:19:28.973]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[02:19:29.033 --> 02:19:31.475]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[02:19:31.875 --> 02:19:35.157]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:19:35.237 --> 02:19:38.960]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:39.280]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:39.300 --> 02:19:39.480]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.899 --> 02:19:48.341]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.901 --> 02:19:55.927]  Did you know that Bible prophecy talks about the United States, British Commonwealth, Russia, China, and the communist world in the last days?
[02:19:56.867 --> 02:20:02.492]  Did you know that it predicts the confrontation between atheistic communism and the western world of Christianity?
[02:20:02.932 --> 02:20:03.392]  We're good to go.
[02:20:17.751 --> 02:20:19.552]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:19.692 --> 02:20:20.112]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:20.132 --> 02:20:23.333]  Call for a one-year free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:20:23.353 --> 02:20:23.933]  It's free.
[02:20:24.053 --> 02:20:26.934]  Call now while our operators are standing by to take your call.
[02:20:47.372 --> 02:20:49.473]  Does this sound bring on a sudden onset of fear?
[02:20:49.933 --> 02:20:51.853]  A fear of not knowing who's on the other end?
[02:20:52.133 --> 02:20:56.594]  Do you avoid picking up the phone knowing it's just going to be another harassing phone call from a debt collector?
[02:20:56.754 --> 02:21:01.196]  Do you resent your daily trips to the mailbox knowing it will be flooded with notices from creditors?
[02:21:01.516 --> 02:21:04.456]  Over 1 million credit card holders will declare bankruptcy this year.
[02:21:04.696 --> 02:21:07.057]  Learn how to legally eliminate your credit card debt.
[02:21:07.217 --> 02:21:07.817]  Want to know more?
[02:21:08.017 --> 02:21:08.237]  Call 920-293-8024.
[02:21:08.257 --> 02:21:08.537]  That's 920-293-8024.
[02:21:16.098 --> 02:21:18.578]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[02:21:19.059 --> 02:21:20.959]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[02:21:21.659 --> 02:21:24.860]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:31.961]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[02:21:32.741 --> 02:21:34.941]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[02:21:35.322 --> 02:21:35.762]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:35.822 --> 02:21:37.242]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:54.128 --> 02:21:55.689]  Mark Cornkey is our guest.
[02:21:58.552 --> 02:22:00.434]  We have loaded phone lines here.
[02:22:00.514 --> 02:22:02.415]  Mark, I want to go to some calls right now.
[02:22:02.796 --> 02:22:15.827]  And then, before you leave us, in the next 15 minutes or so, before we get near the end of the show, I want you to spend five minutes on what you see happening in the future, projecting the lines forward off of past global crime syndicate
[02:22:16.620 --> 02:22:27.303]  Allied crime syndicate activities and to talk about when you think that nuke attack will take place or how we stop it or if that bioweapon will be released and then walk through a few other key points.
[02:22:27.343 --> 02:22:28.223]  So that's coming up.
[02:22:28.243 --> 02:22:31.004]  We'll get Mark's take on it right now.
[02:22:31.024 --> 02:22:36.505]  And Mark, before we go any further, are there any websites you want to plug or anything you want to get out of the people?
[02:22:36.866 --> 02:22:39.686]  We can give out an address real quick and also our website.
[02:22:40.327 --> 02:22:42.747]  First of all, the address is PBN.
[02:22:43.227 --> 02:22:45.508]  That's Papa Bravo November PBN.
[02:22:46.724 --> 02:22:47.184]  P.O.
[02:22:47.264 --> 02:22:51.708]  Box 194, Dexter, that's D-E-X-T-E-R, Michigan, 48130.
[02:22:51.748 --> 02:22:52.468]  Again, PBN, P.O.
[02:22:52.608 --> 02:22:54.610]  Box 194, Dexter, Michigan, 48130.
[02:22:55.450 --> 02:22:59.993]  And then you can, of course, go to our website at www.pbn.4mg.com.
[02:23:00.013 --> 02:23:00.854]  That's www.pbn.4mg.com.
[02:23:18.984 --> 02:23:23.685]  That's the Patriot Broadcasting Network.
[02:23:23.805 --> 02:23:24.286]  That's right.
[02:23:24.466 --> 02:23:26.827]  And of course, we'll have information up about the books.
[02:23:27.407 --> 02:23:29.748]  That's a project that I just immersed myself in.
[02:23:30.128 --> 02:23:32.128]  It was an ongoing effort.
[02:23:32.408 --> 02:23:33.089]  Two series.
[02:23:33.329 --> 02:23:37.310]  The first series is The Dagger War, which is 12 books.
[02:23:38.471 --> 02:23:43.412]  Each book, of course, covers a different perspective, but there's a little write-up about each one.
[02:23:43.993 --> 02:23:45.013]  I should be on the site by now.
[02:23:45.615 --> 02:23:53.037]  But these books were, of course, these lead up to the actual jumping off of a conflict here inside the United States.
[02:23:53.057 --> 02:23:54.637]  And that's called Battle for the Republic.
[02:23:54.677 --> 02:24:02.339]  So in the first series, you talk about all the things that have happened, and then it shifts kind of into a forward perspective with Battle for the Republic?
[02:24:02.719 --> 02:24:03.199]  That's right.
[02:24:03.279 --> 02:24:05.979]  And in Battle for the Republic... Now, what are you going to publish first?
[02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:08.320]  Well, actually, we've already been printing.
[02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:12.701]  It was just kind of a fun thing because people don't realize this, and the system didn't, and I'm out of it now.
[02:24:13.422 --> 02:24:22.308]  But, uh, we were actually producing the book internally, and so several of your listeners who are out there right now have courtesy copies of the books in hand.
[02:24:22.508 --> 02:24:25.090]  No, I understand, Mark, but when are you going to get it to a printer and mass-produce?
[02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:26.591]  Oh, it's already to go, right now.
[02:24:26.871 --> 02:24:31.775]  Uh, in fact, book two will be coming out of the, off the press here very shortly, like within the next two days.
[02:24:31.795 --> 02:24:33.056]  Sorry, it's kind of like Star Wars.
[02:24:33.076 --> 02:24:36.338]  You're jumping ahead to the middle with Battle of the Republic first.
[02:24:37.026 --> 02:24:38.687]  Well, actually it will probably be okay.
[02:24:38.727 --> 02:24:41.989]  Dance of Swords is going to come out at the same time.
[02:24:42.009 --> 02:24:42.829]  That's the first book.
[02:24:42.889 --> 02:24:44.430]  Battle for the Republic, Dance of Swords.
[02:24:44.930 --> 02:24:47.251]  And then Battle for the Republic, The Winter War.
[02:24:47.592 --> 02:24:50.493]  The third book is Battle for the Republic, A Dark Anniversary.
[02:24:51.414 --> 02:24:54.895]  And it'll probably go on to 12 volumes of this also.
[02:24:56.416 --> 02:25:00.238]  But 1 and 2 are coming out almost as quickly as we're talking here.
[02:25:00.258 --> 02:25:01.379]  It'll be within the next 2 to 3 weeks.
[02:25:02.409 --> 02:25:03.810]  We'll have copies.
[02:25:03.891 --> 02:25:05.732]  And this was made behind enemy lines?
[02:25:06.153 --> 02:25:14.061]  Oh, not only was it made behind enemy lines, but some of your listeners out there have leather-bound, case-bound editions that I personally built while I was in the system.
[02:25:14.781 --> 02:25:16.303]  Well, I need one of those!
[02:25:17.904 --> 02:25:25.372]  Well, the thing was, out here I could do it quickly, but you gotta remember, doing it in there, that took a lot of creative work, and it was because we had a
[02:25:25.982 --> 02:25:29.603]  I had typists, I had skilled people that were, I mean, who worked as a proofreader.
[02:25:30.003 --> 02:25:32.424]  I had skilled individuals who wanted to proofread also.
[02:25:32.444 --> 02:25:35.105]  They got excited because they enjoyed reading the book as they went.
[02:25:35.925 --> 02:25:40.287]  On books, actually, because they were proofreaders for quite some time, you know, depending on which facility.
[02:25:40.967 --> 02:25:44.448]  And I also, we have artwork right now, and I cannot stress this enough.
[02:25:44.468 --> 02:25:49.810]  We have artwork completed that is like nothing to date done for the Patriot Movement.
[02:25:50.390 --> 02:25:52.691]  And I just had a little sampling the day I came out.
[02:25:52.711 --> 02:25:53.691]  We had a little get-together.
[02:25:54.190 --> 02:25:55.811]  I gave a little art show.
[02:25:55.891 --> 02:26:02.773]  It was just some of the items, but the illustrations and the support technology for the posters are all done.
[02:26:02.973 --> 02:26:04.233]  Well, Mark, I want to make it clear.
[02:26:04.614 --> 02:26:06.354]  You know, I've got an online video in Bookstore.
[02:26:06.534 --> 02:26:10.996]  I need to get a copy of it and read it, and I need to carry it as soon as possible.
[02:26:11.496 --> 02:26:13.517]  We're about to break, but let's jam a call in right now.
[02:26:13.537 --> 02:26:14.537]  Let's start getting these calls.
[02:26:14.617 --> 02:26:16.377]  Luke in New York, you're on the air.
[02:26:16.397 --> 02:26:17.018]  Thanks for holding.
[02:26:19.058 --> 02:26:19.559]  Hello, Alex?
[02:26:19.779 --> 02:26:20.239]  Yes, Luke.
[02:26:20.259 --> 02:26:20.639]  Go ahead.
[02:26:21.232 --> 02:26:21.973]  Hey, how you doing buddy?
[02:26:22.553 --> 02:26:25.717]  You were talking about Rosie last night, Sunday, and I just wanted to say... Hey, wait a minute.
[02:26:25.757 --> 02:26:30.341]  This is Luke, who helps lead 9-11 Truth in New York.
[02:26:30.381 --> 02:26:31.543]  He's a twenty-something year old.
[02:26:31.563 --> 02:26:32.824]  How old are you, Luke?
[02:26:32.844 --> 02:26:33.765]  Twenty, man.
[02:26:34.392 --> 02:26:45.956]  You're 20, and you helped me lead a big march with the Loose Chains crew up there in New York on the anniversary, and in the first hour we talked about Rosie O'Donnell, who I haven't liked in the past, but I know people that know her.
[02:26:46.196 --> 02:26:47.816]  She's waking up to the New World Order.
[02:26:48.116 --> 02:26:50.277]  Like Mark said, it's never too late to turn around.
[02:26:50.297 --> 02:26:51.818]  That's what the demon laughed at Faust.
[02:26:52.178 --> 02:27:01.461]  She's gone public on 9-11 Truth, and the 9-11 Truth movement is not covering it, and the mainstream media is not covering it, because it'll blow up big time.
[02:27:01.481 --> 02:27:02.101]  But go ahead.
[02:27:02.748 --> 02:27:03.048]  Exactly.
[02:27:03.088 --> 02:27:03.989]  Nobody's supporting her.
[02:27:04.029 --> 02:27:05.251]  Nobody's saying thank you to her.
[02:27:05.311 --> 02:27:07.913]  And that's why, that's what we're doing here this Wednesday.
[02:27:07.933 --> 02:27:13.319]  We're going to do a demonstration of support for Rosie O'Donnell because they do the show here in New York City.
[02:27:13.812 --> 02:27:19.413]  And this March 21st, Wednesday, 9.30 a.m., we're going to be outside ABC Studios' Tribute Studios.
[02:27:19.653 --> 02:27:20.133]  Stay there!
[02:27:20.213 --> 02:27:21.533]  I want you to shoot video of that.
[02:27:21.553 --> 02:27:22.754]  We've got to get that up on the web.
[02:27:22.774 --> 02:27:23.974]  That's going to be a major report.
[02:27:24.234 --> 02:27:26.454]  I need to talk to you Wednesday to get a text report out on it.
[02:27:26.894 --> 02:27:29.395]  And again, there's a blackout on this because they're scared of it.
[02:27:29.575 --> 02:27:32.795]  We'll get Mark Cornky's take on it, let you finish up, Luke, on the other side.
[02:27:35.696 --> 02:27:36.656]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.096 --> 02:27:38.696]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.716 --> 02:27:42.297]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:27:49.817 --> 02:27:50.677]  Look no further!

[02:28:20.222 --> 02:28:20.762]  I think so.
[02:28:45.658 --> 02:28:52.325]  Thus says Yahweh, if you will not keep my commandments by violating my covenant, I will bring upon you sudden terror!
[02:28:56.187 --> 02:28:59.348]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[02:28:59.588 --> 02:29:03.269]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[02:29:03.549 --> 02:29:11.491]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.
[02:29:11.871 --> 02:29:14.612]  Get to Witness Ministries' next shocking revelation.
[02:29:14.872 --> 02:29:18.113]  The Rider of the White Horse, George W. Bush in Prophecy.

[02:29:21.536 --> 02:29:25.959]  King George II beats the war drums for his next invasion, Iran and Syria.
[02:29:26.300 --> 02:29:29.362]  More nations are to follow, including the draft of your children.
[02:29:29.643 --> 02:29:39.291]  With a $25 love offering to Two Witness Ministries, get the book, The Rider of the White Horse, at Box 2453, Abilene, Texas, 79604.
[02:29:39.671 --> 02:29:43.615]  Unless she repents, America will not survive the Red Horse of World War III.
[02:29:45.951 --> 02:29:48.612]  The future of our world is very uncertain.
[02:29:49.052 --> 02:29:54.874]  Hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, and acts of terrorism are a fact of life.
[02:29:55.655 --> 02:29:58.836]  Natural or man-made disasters can strike at any time.
[02:29:59.497 --> 02:30:06.119]  You and your family should be prepared for the inevitable disaster with an ample stock of food, water, shelter, and supplies.
[02:30:06.480 --> 02:30:13.302]  FortSamsurplus.com offers a full line of disaster and emergency preparedness kits and MRE type prepared foods.
[02:30:13.742 --> 02:30:18.524]  FortSamsurplus.com also offers a full line of survival, tactical, and care kits.
[02:30:21.220 --> 02:30:22.460]  We don't need no education
[02:31:01.418 --> 02:31:02.979]  Okay, Luke in New York.
[02:31:03.020 --> 02:31:04.401]  Finish up with your comments, my friend.
[02:31:04.821 --> 02:31:07.804]  Yeah, Rosie has been ignored by the truth movement and the mass media.
[02:31:07.844 --> 02:31:08.965]  Enough is enough.
[02:31:09.005 --> 02:31:13.569]  So we're going to be out there outside the studios this Wednesday with our 9-11 with an inside banner.
[02:31:14.050 --> 02:31:15.351]  And thank you, Rosie Signs.
[02:31:15.551 --> 02:31:17.593]  And to get more information go to WeAreChange.org.
[02:31:17.613 --> 02:31:19.194]  Information is going to be on there in a little bit.
[02:31:19.214 --> 02:31:20.115]  WeAreChange.org.
[02:31:20.135 --> 02:31:20.776]  Do me a favor.
[02:31:21.437 --> 02:31:21.557]  Yes.
[02:31:21.737 --> 02:31:24.300]  The minute you get that video, get it uploaded.
[02:31:24.340 --> 02:31:25.420]  We want to do a story on it.
[02:31:26.301 --> 02:31:28.883]  Kevin, my producer, needs to talk to you.
[02:31:28.923 --> 02:31:35.569]  I want to set you up that day for the show so you can come on and give us a report so we can get an article out on it.
[02:31:35.589 --> 02:31:39.993]  But I tell you, this is very suspect and I know key signs.
[02:31:40.713 --> 02:31:42.275]  Rosie, I know is a loose cannon.
[02:31:42.395 --> 02:31:43.636]  I've really assessed her.
[02:31:44.317 --> 02:31:45.498]  I've talked to people that know her.
[02:31:46.258 --> 02:31:47.539]  You know, she is a liberal.
[02:31:47.639 --> 02:31:50.482]  She means what she says, but she's been changing.
[02:31:50.562 --> 02:31:52.784]  She now learned about the New World Order in the last year.
[02:31:53.244 --> 02:31:55.246]  That has accelerated in the last two months.
[02:31:56.087 --> 02:31:57.908]  I've talked to folks who directly are talking to her.
[02:31:58.228 --> 02:31:59.209]  I'm trying to get her on.
[02:31:59.850 --> 02:32:01.911]  She now has had her whole paradigm shifted.
[02:32:02.312 --> 02:32:08.437]  She went public and said they blew up 7, named Larry Silverstein and the whole mafia he's involved with.
[02:32:08.457 --> 02:32:10.038]  You put it on a blog?
[02:32:10.939 --> 02:32:15.482]  Well I think because number one it's had kickback already with individuals who are considered to be middle of the road.
[02:32:41.229 --> 02:32:49.611]  Now you're talking about somebody who's in a totally different camp that's understanding the nature of what's going on because this... I'm liking this.
[02:32:49.731 --> 02:32:54.593]  Okay, you know, the Dawn of the Dead movie, the new one, is more in line with where they've headed.
[02:32:54.613 --> 02:33:00.154]  You know, we used to have Dawn of the Dead, blah, they'd slowly be charging, you know, chasing you around and you'd get away from them.
[02:33:01.375 --> 02:33:05.776]  The other side has pushed the high-speed button and everybody can see it.
[02:33:06.640 --> 02:33:12.426]  The only thing that's happening here is how much more denial you're going to put up with certain individuals.
[02:33:25.858 --> 02:33:31.900]  And they're scared to death because they know the type of media hysteria she's caused everywhere she's been involved.
[02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:35.241]  Can you imagine if this thing starts getting covered?
[02:33:35.681 --> 02:33:47.064]  Luke, how suspicious is it that we're now seven days into this breaking, four days into it breaking big, and no mainstream media, and no 9-11 truth?
[02:33:47.084 --> 02:33:50.465]  I know, the suspicious thing is 9-11 truth.
[02:33:50.505 --> 02:33:52.946]  That could be because some of the ego is in a truth moment.
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:34:06.012]  The media is what's run by the corporations, but the media here in New York City, they don't only cover Rosie O'Donnell, they don't even cover the rescue workers and family members asking for a new investigation.
[02:34:07.343 --> 02:34:30.764]  Well, they always say the rescue workers and family members hate us, but then I have Bill Doyle, the head of the Biggest Victims of 9-11 group, over 8,000 members now, and he says it's a total inside job, and most of our members know it's an inside job, and he lost his son, Joey Doyle, and I've been down at Ground Zero, the firefighters wouldn't stop slapping us on the back, most of the police agreed with us, but again, Mark, you always bring it up, and it's key!
[02:34:31.384 --> 02:34:33.724]  There's still the illusion that we're the minority.
[02:34:33.804 --> 02:34:35.745]  It's like Ceaușescu in Romania.
[02:34:35.765 --> 02:34:36.865]  Why don't you tell folks about that?
[02:34:37.385 --> 02:34:37.925]  Good point.
[02:34:38.565 --> 02:34:44.186]  Ceaușescu, of course, understood the use of terror and its supreme claw.
[02:34:44.746 --> 02:34:52.248]  And one of the things to remember is the same tactics that we're describing were used by most of the Eastern Warsaw Pact nations in one form or another.
[02:34:52.308 --> 02:34:56.408]  In Poland, they've got basements full of records still from people who were made to disappear.
[02:34:56.748 --> 02:34:59.769]  Nobody knows what to do with even the records now because they don't want to destroy them.
[02:35:00.290 --> 02:35:02.451]  But they're scared to find out where the bodies are.
[02:35:03.211 --> 02:35:11.075]  Now, in this situation here, what eventually happened is people realizing, you know, realizing they had nothing to lose and everything to gain, eventually just stepped up.
[02:35:11.335 --> 02:35:18.279]  The enforcement arm, of course, either A, swung off into the shadows and had its hidey-hole somewhere overseas or in another country,
[02:35:18.843 --> 02:35:23.926]  And then a percentage lined up with the people because they realized that the power shift had taken place.
[02:35:24.567 --> 02:35:32.272]  We're in a similar situation here, but this is a much more dangerous game in that all of you... We're now going at the heart of the empire here.
[02:35:32.292 --> 02:35:33.793]  We're not going after its satellites.
[02:35:33.853 --> 02:35:37.215]  We are going right up against the fortress of Mordor.
[02:35:37.436 --> 02:35:38.276]  Right, exactly.
[02:35:38.336 --> 02:35:39.317]  This is the dark side.
[02:35:39.357 --> 02:35:45.161]  And with that being the case, everybody needs to have physical preparedness in place first, right now.
[02:35:45.908 --> 02:35:54.878]  Better of a couple hundred pounds of poor rolled oats from the feed mill than to be, you know, eating the rear end out of a possum later on because it's the best you can do.
[02:35:56.961 --> 02:35:57.802]  Hold on just a second.
[02:35:57.822 --> 02:35:58.743]  Luke, you want to finish up?
[02:35:58.763 --> 02:36:00.745]  Tell folks when that demonstration is again.
[02:36:00.765 --> 02:36:04.830]  The demonstration is March 21st, Wednesday, 930 a.m.
[02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:06.772]  outside ABC's The View Studios.
[02:36:07.390 --> 02:36:11.111]  32 West 66th Street just past West End Avenue.
[02:36:11.271 --> 02:36:15.913]  Get me a one page press release and email it to Kevin at InfoWars.com.
[02:36:15.953 --> 02:36:17.193]  I want to get that up on all the sites.
[02:36:18.293 --> 02:36:24.015]  Write it right now and spell out why you're doing it and we'll post it and get you a few million readers.
[02:36:26.056 --> 02:36:27.196]  They've got to be scared though.
[02:36:27.216 --> 02:36:29.797]  They thought Charlie Sheen, because he had a little bit of baggage,
[02:36:30.914 --> 02:36:33.917]  Womanizing a decade ago, that they could demonize him.
[02:36:33.937 --> 02:36:36.040]  When it blew up in their face, they suddenly shut it down.
[02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:38.142]  I talked to CNN execs and said, yeah, we were told.
[02:36:39.344 --> 02:36:41.485]  Shut it down by the way, we're fans, you know, we're with you.
[02:36:42.026 --> 02:36:48.970]  I mean, that happens so much now, Mark, where I'll be, and I mean, it's real, it's genuine, with pretty high-powered people that are going, I wish I could tell the truth.
[02:36:49.190 --> 02:36:50.471]  We're trying to sneak it through.
[02:36:50.491 --> 02:36:56.375]  I mean, I don't, do you think the system realizes that they are so close to Ceausescu level?
[02:36:56.495 --> 02:36:58.436]  I mean, it's just, it's so close, Mark.
[02:36:58.696 --> 02:37:03.940]  Well, the thing that they're worried about, and this is where the knee-jerk reaction comes in, is that, well, we have to be prepared.
[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:05.861]  The reason I said physical preparedness is this.
[02:37:06.488 --> 02:37:09.511]  The system demonstrated its lack of response with Katrina.
[02:37:10.051 --> 02:37:16.457]  With that being the case, imagine if you will, and again, let's just ask one simple question before going farther.
[02:37:16.857 --> 02:37:21.821]  What one country has an illegal and unregistered nuclear arsenal in the Middle East?
[02:37:22.862 --> 02:37:28.687]  Israel with 400 to 600 weapons, cruise missiles, long-range missiles, German Dolphin subs.
[02:37:28.927 --> 02:37:31.910]  How did they get a nuclear arsenal without stealing it?
[02:37:33.072 --> 02:37:34.753]  They were given it.
[02:37:34.934 --> 02:37:35.114]  Right.
[02:37:35.814 --> 02:37:37.476]  Between different countries and parties.
[02:37:37.536 --> 02:37:39.738]  I've read some fascinating stories by FBI.
[02:37:39.858 --> 02:37:47.564]  I mean, these are documented that are texts where people are talking about their reports about the material literally being given away.
[02:37:47.644 --> 02:37:50.106]  You know who runs security on all U.S.
[02:37:50.126 --> 02:37:51.267]  nuclear weapons facilities?
[02:37:51.888 --> 02:37:54.370]  An Israeli government-controlled firm.
[02:37:54.610 --> 02:37:55.711]  And remember, just after 9-11.
[02:37:59.011 --> 02:38:05.592]  You had three different incidents where Israelis were caught with, in one case, fuel rods from the Oak Ridge facility.
[02:38:05.632 --> 02:38:07.633]  That was in the AP, but never got picked up.
[02:38:07.773 --> 02:38:13.074]  That's right, and in fact it was covered locally, but it was not covered nationally, other than just as a blurb.
[02:38:13.514 --> 02:38:22.516]  You had several other teams of Israelis that were picked up, they were arrested, and then they were immediately whisked out of the country and shot back overseas.
[02:38:23.056 --> 02:38:26.977]  Now, what's most likely, this is why you asked, where would they go with this?
[02:38:27.077 --> 02:38:28.497]  Well, because of the situation,
[02:38:29.031 --> 02:38:30.773]  The crisis will be on the East Coast.
[02:38:31.194 --> 02:38:33.616]  I do not believe New York, although that is possible.
[02:38:33.676 --> 02:38:35.058]  It's one of the optional targets.
[02:38:35.118 --> 02:38:37.401]  But you need the globalists to have more personnel in place.
[02:38:37.641 --> 02:38:43.668]  I think what they're more interested in, remember, they need crisis, but they can't, excuse me, they can't urinate in the pool too much.
[02:38:44.252 --> 02:38:47.615]  So the West Coast, well again, even that would be a throw of the dice.
[02:38:47.635 --> 02:38:52.299]  It depends on how crazy, you know, whoever is in charge of planning this, what they're willing to do.
[02:38:52.820 --> 02:38:57.223]  But remember, an East Coast strike means that the majority of the heavy fallout lands in the Atlantic.
[02:38:57.784 --> 02:39:01.147]  They have to pick a metropolitan area that can be sacrificed easily.
[02:39:01.667 --> 02:39:10.235]  The New York metropolitan area ties in a lot of resources that would agitate a lot of co-conspirators, or whatever you want to call them, cooperation personnel.
[02:39:10.771 --> 02:39:12.933]  So for that reason, go farther down the coast.
[02:39:12.993 --> 02:39:14.835]  You guys covered Charleston before.
[02:39:14.855 --> 02:39:22.501]  I would look at also the fact that Jacksonville is a high probability target because two things usually tie into this.
[02:39:22.561 --> 02:39:28.907]  They need to get rid of old infrastructure that they would lose money on because they would have to spend money to tear it down.
[02:39:29.631 --> 02:39:30.731]  Right now we have a P.O.L.
[02:39:30.791 --> 02:39:31.292]  point.
[02:39:31.472 --> 02:39:38.094]  That's right, they always do a benefit analysis across the board for targets and it has to help them at every level.
[02:39:38.334 --> 02:39:38.854]  Exactly.
[02:39:38.874 --> 02:39:43.535]  So you're thinking a low yield or do you think they'll detonate a weapons grade?
[02:39:43.795 --> 02:39:49.317]  All it has to do is be something enough to damage the area critically and of course create crisis.
[02:39:49.815 --> 02:39:54.717]  What we need to watch, everybody out there listening, is to pay attention to all of the government agencies.
[02:39:54.737 --> 02:39:55.938]  Hey, I'll tell you what, hold on a second.
[02:39:55.958 --> 02:39:58.419]  Hey, get that Shattered Union piece queued up, John.
[02:39:59.159 --> 02:40:00.760]  Go ahead, Mark.
[02:40:01.020 --> 02:40:05.662]  Pay attention to the ADL and pay attention to other government agencies.
[02:40:05.682 --> 02:40:13.025]  Because they'll do pre-programming before the event in the preparatory phase, which shot up the alarm bells for me months before 9-11.
[02:40:13.225 --> 02:40:17.707]  And the next thing that they will do is they will evacuate their people before the strike.
[02:40:18.908 --> 02:40:22.356]  They will evacuate and warn their people before the strike.
[02:40:22.957 --> 02:40:24.220]  You need to pay attention.
[02:40:24.300 --> 02:40:25.744]  Treat them as canaries.
[02:40:26.303 --> 02:40:30.865]  Miners took canaries into the tunnels because they fell first, and that way the miners could get out.
[02:40:31.285 --> 02:40:32.065]  Absolutely.
[02:40:32.425 --> 02:40:38.067]  In this case, these canaries are going to leave en masse before the strike.
[02:40:38.087 --> 02:40:39.767]  The CFR likes to brag.
[02:40:40.468 --> 02:40:48.810]  They did a year before 9-11 saying this was going to happen, and then all 51 of the recommendations got implemented by the CFR board, the Hart-Rubin Commission.
[02:40:49.111 --> 02:40:53.232]  The Hart-Rubin Commission has been saying Dallas, Cleveland, Denver,
[02:40:53.932 --> 02:41:00.216]  And Dallas, Cleveland, Denver, and one other, Chicago, are the targets for a nuke.
[02:41:00.316 --> 02:41:02.217]  And they said it will happen.
[02:41:02.257 --> 02:41:03.718]  You don't see those as main targets?
[02:41:04.118 --> 02:41:10.062]  Well, the reason, okay, consider this, they could successfully operate with fewer targets and still end up with the same...
[02:41:11.043 --> 02:41:14.105]  The Chicago metropolitan area would go into an absolute meltdown.
[02:41:14.205 --> 02:41:17.447]  Any of the large metropolitan areas don't have the infrastructure to support themselves.
[02:41:17.467 --> 02:41:19.668]  So you don't think they want to go super extreme?
[02:41:19.688 --> 02:41:23.591]  You think they want to do kind of a, in an isolated area like an OKC?
[02:41:23.611 --> 02:41:24.792]  That's why you say Jacksonville.
[02:41:24.912 --> 02:41:32.217]  Well, I say Austin is a prime target because it's a million people, but it's not connected to other big cities that would cause a domino.
[02:41:32.477 --> 02:41:33.317]  Well, it's an option.
[02:41:33.377 --> 02:41:40.002]  But again, remember, the idea is that you can get the same result without doing as much damage to the infrastructure that's going to be taken over.
[02:41:40.635 --> 02:41:45.960]  By doing the East Coast, remember your float over, you're going to go to 80,000 feet with whatever you set off.
[02:41:46.521 --> 02:41:47.622]  It's going to go downrange.
[02:41:48.042 --> 02:41:51.165]  This means with planetary spin combined with wind variance,
[02:41:51.550 --> 02:41:55.312]  You're going to have the stuff floating out over the Atlantic and dropping into a neutral area.
[02:41:55.332 --> 02:41:56.292]  There's two advantages.
[02:41:56.472 --> 02:41:58.033]  A, you get what you want in the United States.
[02:41:58.493 --> 02:42:00.114]  B, you don't agitate the neighbors.
[02:42:00.134 --> 02:42:06.117]  Well, that is the problem with a ground detonation and not an airburst, is it will radically increase the fallout.
[02:42:06.437 --> 02:42:06.618]  Right.
[02:42:06.698 --> 02:42:08.098]  No matter what, you're going to have some.
[02:42:08.238 --> 02:42:13.141]  So with that being the case, you don't want to also agitate the people downrange that might be part of the program.
[02:42:14.101 --> 02:42:17.043]  That's why, again, the probability is East Coast.
[02:42:17.083 --> 02:42:19.544]  Now here, again, there's still, it's a percentage issue.
[02:42:20.439 --> 02:42:22.281]  We don't know what's in their devious evil minds.
[02:42:22.361 --> 02:42:24.723]  We don't know how crazy in the head these people have gotten.
[02:42:24.743 --> 02:42:26.304]  But we've seen their preparatory.
[02:42:26.384 --> 02:42:31.489]  We've seen their preparatory and it's nuke, nuke, nuke, dirty bomb, bioweapon, bird flu, nuke, dirty bomb.
[02:42:31.729 --> 02:42:32.190]  Exactly.
[02:42:32.550 --> 02:42:40.577]  And again, in some cases, remember, they could do even a radiological weapon that could have low devastating effect.
[02:42:40.597 --> 02:42:42.519]  In other words, they could go a tactical device
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:51.925]  It would be damaging, but they could keep it dirty, or they could actually fracture it to make it more of a nastier device with regard to longevity.
[02:42:51.965 --> 02:42:53.346]  Like a jacket in cobalt.
[02:42:53.726 --> 02:42:54.106]  That's right.
[02:42:54.126 --> 02:42:55.847]  There's a number of different options that they have.
[02:42:55.907 --> 02:42:58.189]  Now again, there's unlimited spending from the other end.
[02:42:58.229 --> 02:43:07.374]  But remember, the people who have that big, unauthorized, illegal arsenal in the Middle East, they have to keep it within certain means, because
[02:43:07.975 --> 02:43:09.736]  You gotta make it look like the other guys.
[02:43:09.796 --> 02:43:14.879]  Now this doesn't mean, first of all, I don't trust anybody in the Middle East when it comes to strategic potential.
[02:43:15.559 --> 02:43:15.959]  Nobody.
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:18.221]  But I don't trust the Israelis at all.
[02:43:18.741 --> 02:43:24.044]  Because the Israelis have another agenda and they want to use us as the stunt dummy.
[02:43:24.484 --> 02:43:26.925]  With that being the case, that means turn and look left and right.
[02:43:26.985 --> 02:43:33.349]  The people sitting to your left, the guy sitting across the table from you, are their purported proposed casualties.
[02:43:34.443 --> 02:43:39.966]  If they're talking to us now, okay, for all this stuff about we're going to protect our country by keeping it away from the nation, really?
[02:43:40.426 --> 02:43:41.947]  Look at what happened with September 11th.
[02:43:41.987 --> 02:43:44.349]  They dragged it right into the United States.
[02:43:44.889 --> 02:43:46.730]  And they could have stopped every step of that.
[02:43:46.890 --> 02:43:49.251]  I argue again, the trained professionals all know this.
[02:43:49.351 --> 02:43:49.672]  I agree.
[02:43:49.692 --> 02:43:52.313]  Mark, I want to play this two-minute clip and I want to jam in calls.
[02:43:52.353 --> 02:43:53.334]  We've got to move quick.
[02:43:53.354 --> 02:43:55.035]  We've got to get some calls in.
[02:43:55.095 --> 02:43:59.977]  But this is just an ad for a video game, but this is part of the whole preparatory mindset.
[02:44:00.258 --> 02:44:02.119]  This is the exact type of thing they're planning.
[02:44:02.159 --> 02:44:02.499]  Here it is.
[02:44:03.396 --> 02:44:06.839]  Following a disputed election and a tie vote, the U.S.
[02:44:06.899 --> 02:44:09.962]  Congress installs the most unpopular president in U.S.
[02:44:09.982 --> 02:44:15.207]  history as David Jefferson Adams becomes the 44th president of the United States.
[02:44:15.808 --> 02:44:24.836]  Shortly after the election, increased unrest, rioting, and a growing number of militias have given rise to ever-increasing domestic terrorism.
[02:44:25.677 --> 02:44:28.660]  In response, the president invokes the Homeland Security Act.
[02:44:29.289 --> 02:44:32.770]  ...and declares martial law on the West Coast and other areas of the country.
[02:44:33.370 --> 02:44:41.572]  Though highly contested, a Supreme Court ruling sidesteps the electoral process, disqualifying popular presidential candidates from several states.
[02:44:42.732 --> 02:44:49.693]  Public outrage explodes when a sham election leads to incumbent David Adams accepting a second term in office.
[02:44:51.874 --> 02:44:55.734]  During the 57th Inauguration Day ceremonies, Washington D.C.
[02:44:55.834 --> 02:44:58.315]  is struck by a low-yield nuclear weapon
[02:44:58.874 --> 02:45:01.275]  ...killing David Adams and most of the U.S.
[02:45:01.336 --> 02:45:02.136]  Congress.
[02:45:03.817 --> 02:45:05.858]  The destruction of Washington, D.C.
[02:45:06.299 --> 02:45:10.161]  effectively breaks the chain of succession, sending the nation into chaos.
[02:45:10.881 --> 02:45:16.064]  In an emergency vote, the European Union deploys peacekeepers in the greater D.C.
[02:45:16.184 --> 02:45:18.606]  area to secure international interest.
[02:45:20.060 --> 02:45:27.446]  With separatist sentiment rising, California's governor declares home rule and secedes from the Union.
[02:45:28.266 --> 02:45:37.273]  Texas follows quickly and declares sovereignty, taking neighboring states with them and forming the Republic of Texas.
[02:45:37.313 --> 02:45:44.179]  Now, the once United States of America lie in ruin.
[02:45:45.359 --> 02:45:47.121]  The time for words has passed.
[02:45:48.095 --> 02:45:53.903]  And the Second American Civil War now erupts as seven factions wage war across the land.
[02:45:55.485 --> 02:45:58.169]  They battle one another to reclaim a nation.
[02:45:59.471 --> 02:46:00.593]  To restore peace.
[02:46:01.934 --> 02:46:04.919]  To rebuild this shattered union.
[02:46:05.982 --> 02:46:13.548]  Now let's be clear, this type scenario, which they've actually written up, comes two or three attacks later, not the next phase.
[02:46:13.608 --> 02:46:15.950]  But Mark, I tell you, they're really throwing it in our face with that one.
[02:46:16.371 --> 02:46:21.795]  Yes, as a matter of fact, remember that there are a number of different think tanks, including Rand, that have walked through this formula.
[02:46:22.796 --> 02:46:26.879]  You can go back as far as the original book done by H.G.
[02:46:26.940 --> 02:46:27.320]  Wells,
[02:46:28.253 --> 02:46:31.516]  The Open Conspiracy.
[02:46:31.716 --> 02:46:32.776]  That's another one.
[02:46:32.816 --> 02:46:35.758]  It's hard-bound, very small, very concise.
[02:46:35.819 --> 02:46:40.061]  Talks about the use of national crisis to create the international market.
[02:46:40.081 --> 02:46:42.943]  Of course, who used to be one of the sub-directors of the Rand Corporation?
[02:46:42.983 --> 02:46:43.844]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:46:43.984 --> 02:46:44.384]  Exactly.
[02:46:44.404 --> 02:46:46.266]  Let's jam in another call here quickly.
[02:46:46.606 --> 02:46:48.607]  Let's talk to, who's up next here in order?
[02:46:49.628 --> 02:46:50.949]  Weston in Texas, go ahead.
[02:46:51.736 --> 02:46:53.237]  Hey, Alex, what's going on, man?
[02:46:53.737 --> 02:46:55.439]  Commander-in-Chief of the Resistance.
[02:46:55.479 --> 02:46:56.799]  Pleasure to share a line with you.
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:58.901]  No, we're all together on the slide, my friend.
[02:46:59.741 --> 02:47:04.444]  No, seriously, though, I got a little list here of things I wanted to talk about.
[02:47:04.484 --> 02:47:07.286]  First of all, I bought three DVDs straight off the bat.
[02:47:07.306 --> 02:47:09.108]  A hundred InfoWars stickers.
[02:47:09.128 --> 02:47:10.428]  They're going up all over Dallas.
[02:47:10.609 --> 02:47:10.909]  Good.
[02:47:11.749 --> 02:47:14.551]  I wanted to call and talk about the Truth Lifestyle, man.
[02:47:14.791 --> 02:47:16.392]  I just got my Sport Berkey.
[02:47:16.432 --> 02:47:17.313]  Been using it every day.
[02:47:17.333 --> 02:47:20.215]  You know, it's working out, staying away from the vaccines.
[02:47:20.970 --> 02:47:21.951]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:47:21.991 --> 02:47:28.016]  In fact, it's the tactical area where we're going to win because the people organized individually
[02:47:46.811 --> 02:47:50.693]  Small teams can always be organized into larger, 5-10, 5-10, remember that.
[02:47:50.873 --> 02:47:54.435]  A squad, so many squads make up a platoon, platoons make up companies.
[02:47:54.895 --> 02:47:59.237]  It's the same with civil defense, it's the same with actual industrial organization.
[02:47:59.758 --> 02:48:10.363]  No matter what it is, it's the local area, the tactical preparedness that's going to keep the country strong and will probably make the people on the other side think before they act.
[02:48:11.497 --> 02:48:23.727]  Well, there's no doubt they haven't moved more physically against us because they know, as you said when we were talking on the phone the other day, they're waiting for the person to run down the street with the hair burning and yelling and screaming.
[02:48:24.528 --> 02:48:30.853]  When we come back, Mark, describe that and then real fast, Weston, finish up and then we'll go to Mike, Adam and Mark.
[02:48:30.893 --> 02:48:31.674]  We've got to move quick.
[02:48:32.014 --> 02:48:34.617]  Each caller about 40 seconds with Mark Kornke on the other side.
[02:48:35.357 --> 02:48:38.801]  We've got to get Mark back in the near future to do a few more hours so we can take your calls.
[02:48:39.281 --> 02:48:40.042]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:48:40.102 --> 02:48:41.583]  PrisonPlanet.com is the website.
[02:48:45.936 --> 02:48:53.879]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[02:48:54.340 --> 02:48:57.481]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[02:49:48.667 --> 02:49:54.096]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:49:54.496 --> 02:50:02.108]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:50:02.839 --> 02:50:09.882]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:50:10.282 --> 02:50:21.707]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:50:22.007 --> 02:50:25.949]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:50:25.969 --> 02:50:27.890]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:50:28.250 --> 02:50:32.012]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:45.208 --> 02:50:50.289]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:50:50.369 --> 02:50:57.671]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:50:57.811 --> 02:51:08.433]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:51:08.653 --> 02:51:13.194]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:51:13.474 --> 02:51:18.477]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[02:51:18.677 --> 02:51:21.619]  Yes, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:51:21.839 --> 02:51:31.524]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[02:51:31.544 --> 02:51:34.225]  Okay, I wanted to say with the DVT that Dick Cheney has, the deep vein thrombosis,
[02:51:59.207 --> 02:52:07.369]  I had one of those when I was 20, and if it's going to be as hard on him as it was on me, with four heart attacks and all those surgeries, I don't think he can make it through it anyway.
[02:52:07.389 --> 02:52:10.810]  You know, they're not going to be able to fight us this long.
[02:52:20.948 --> 02:52:24.830]  I don't know if you... No, I don't call myself the T-Rex.
[02:52:24.890 --> 02:52:31.093]  Years ago, about 20 liners got written up, some by me, some by the network, and somebody said, the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:52:31.153 --> 02:52:34.395]  It just means aggressive on top of it.
[02:52:34.435 --> 02:52:35.356]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:52:35.976 --> 02:52:37.597]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike.
[02:52:37.737 --> 02:52:39.478]  Mike, where are you calling us from?
[02:52:40.418 --> 02:52:41.899]  New Iberia, Louisiana.
[02:52:42.099 --> 02:52:42.379]  Welcome.
[02:52:42.399 --> 02:52:42.900]  You're on the air.
[02:52:42.940 --> 02:52:43.340]  Go ahead.
[02:52:43.940 --> 02:52:44.641]  Hello, Mark.
[02:52:44.841 --> 02:52:45.321]  We got you.
[02:52:45.361 --> 02:52:45.701]  Go ahead.
[02:52:47.382 --> 02:52:48.242]  I'm just calling to...
[02:52:50.259 --> 02:52:52.980]  To welcome Mark back out from the belly of the beast.
[02:52:53.660 --> 02:52:55.600]  And uh... Praise God he's okay.
[02:52:56.300 --> 02:52:57.100]  Amen brother.
[02:52:57.420 --> 02:53:00.801]  He's been reforged stronger in the fires of hell.
[02:53:02.622 --> 02:53:04.242]  You said it word for word brother.
[02:53:06.062 --> 02:53:11.463]  I know Mark has been in the Patriot movement for a long time.
[02:53:11.483 --> 02:53:14.444]  I used to listen to him every night.
[02:53:14.984 --> 02:53:17.025]  Just like I listen to you daily.
[02:53:17.725 --> 02:53:19.185]  And at night and uh...
[02:53:20.086 --> 02:53:25.168]  There's been myself and so many more waiting for his return.
[02:53:25.188 --> 02:53:30.829]  Well, I talked to Ted and I think we're going to get Mark on the air here on Genesis and I'm sure he'll be doing other things as well.
[02:53:30.849 --> 02:53:32.850]  I'm definitely going to carry his new book.
[02:53:33.330 --> 02:53:34.410]  Well, I sure hope so.
[02:53:34.430 --> 02:53:43.173]  You keep up the good work and Mark, I'm just proud to have you out.
[02:53:44.113 --> 02:53:49.655]  I know you redoubled your efforts when they locked you down and you never stopped.
[02:53:50.194 --> 02:53:52.835]  And you will never stop, and I commend you for that.
[02:53:53.556 --> 02:53:59.699]  Not that I'm someone who can commend anybody, but... The incredible thing is, they set him up on video.
[02:53:59.739 --> 02:54:02.680]  They ran him off the road and put him in jail for seven years.
[02:54:03.281 --> 02:54:03.581]  Yeah.
[02:54:04.781 --> 02:54:06.022]  They can't break that guy.
[02:54:07.002 --> 02:54:15.867]  Well, I think he got... Mark, I gotta tell you, I mean, you've gotten stronger since you... I mean, you're... I mean, I think... Because I think a lot of the people out there like that gentleman were...
[02:54:16.573 --> 02:54:22.038]  Presenting their prayers, and I believe just as you said, give all the glory to God because He's the one we have to answer to.
[02:54:22.418 --> 02:54:23.039]  Absolutely.
[02:54:23.099 --> 02:54:24.680]  Thank you for the call, Mike.
[02:54:25.201 --> 02:54:27.403]  Adam in, uh, where are you calling from?
[02:54:29.584 --> 02:54:30.445]  Adam, go ahead, sir.
[02:54:30.545 --> 02:54:31.086]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:54:31.126 --> 02:54:32.727]  Where are you calling from, Adam?
[02:54:33.848 --> 02:54:34.148]  Andrew.
[02:54:34.569 --> 02:54:35.089]  Okay, Andrew.
[02:54:35.109 --> 02:54:36.110]  Where are you calling from, Andrew?
[02:54:36.290 --> 02:54:36.731]  Missouri.
[02:54:36.851 --> 02:54:37.491]  Missouri, go ahead.
[02:54:37.972 --> 02:54:41.555]  I was wondering how bad the suppression of Ron Paul is.
[02:54:43.522 --> 02:54:45.023]  It's almost complete.
[02:54:45.083 --> 02:54:52.404]  He keeps winning all the big scientific polls online and straw polls, but the national media is ignoring him.
[02:54:52.444 --> 02:54:58.345]  And every time he keeps winning the polls, the poll companies decide that people are cheating, so they pull him off.
[02:54:58.665 --> 02:55:00.185]  They don't understand how popular he is.
[02:55:00.205 --> 02:55:00.846]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:01.106 --> 02:55:04.006]  Mark Kornke, what do you think of the Ron Paul running for president?
[02:55:04.166 --> 02:55:06.327]  Okay, we don't care whether or not they're going to cover him.
[02:55:06.407 --> 02:55:08.187]  We need to shout from the rooftops.
[02:55:08.786 --> 02:55:14.508]  Everybody needs to shout from the rooftops that if they're going to motivate for someone, try to motivate for someone who's always been there for us.
[02:55:14.588 --> 02:55:17.869]  And Ron Paul has stayed the course absolutely.
[02:55:17.889 --> 02:55:19.290]  He's founding father material.
[02:55:19.530 --> 02:55:19.990]  That's right.
[02:55:20.470 --> 02:55:23.851]  He's the person right now who cares whether or not ABC NBC or CBS.
[02:55:23.891 --> 02:55:29.473]  And notice at this very time, God's given us somebody like Ron Paul and he's decided to run when both parties are weak.
[02:55:29.873 --> 02:55:30.313]  That's right.
[02:55:30.373 --> 02:55:31.314]  We have the tools.
[02:55:31.414 --> 02:55:32.314]  We have the people.
[02:55:32.374 --> 02:55:33.394]  We have the resources.
[02:55:33.454 --> 02:55:34.615]  We shall prevail!
[02:55:35.295 --> 02:55:36.035]  Mark in Michigan.
[02:55:36.055 --> 02:55:37.056]  You're on with Mark in Michigan.
[02:55:37.096 --> 02:55:37.356]  Go ahead.
[02:55:37.376 --> 02:55:37.676]  Hurry.
[02:55:37.896 --> 02:55:38.376]  Go, go, go.
[02:55:38.636 --> 02:55:39.016]  Hey, Alex.
[02:55:39.056 --> 02:55:39.576]  How you doing?
[02:55:39.596 --> 02:55:40.677]  It's great to be on the show.
[02:55:41.197 --> 02:55:41.397]  Good.
[02:55:41.437 --> 02:55:41.797]  Go ahead.
[02:55:42.537 --> 02:55:43.118]  Hey, Alex.
[02:55:43.138 --> 02:55:45.038]  I want to congratulate you on your fine show.
[02:55:45.078 --> 02:55:47.499]  I want to welcome Mark back to the good side of the razor wire.
[02:55:47.819 --> 02:55:48.139]  Thank you, sir.
[02:55:48.159 --> 02:55:51.861]  You guys have been doing a great job between you, and I want to tell you that we're all praying for you.
[02:55:52.761 --> 02:55:55.322]  I pray to Yahweh daily to keep you strong.
[02:55:55.482 --> 02:55:55.862]  I need it.
[02:55:55.882 --> 02:55:56.062]  Safe.
[02:55:59.133 --> 02:56:09.158]  My question is, what I saw was Ron Paul on your Infowars website, and I think you guys ought to be dressed in colonial style attire and standing right next to him.
[02:56:10.559 --> 02:56:11.319]  We'll do what we can.
[02:56:12.120 --> 02:56:14.541]  Well, we've got big links on all the sites.
[02:56:14.561 --> 02:56:17.382]  We're promoting his presidency as best we can to support us.
[02:56:17.483 --> 02:56:18.883]  Mark Cornkeep, it was great having you on.
[02:56:18.903 --> 02:56:20.564]  We'll have you on very soon, my friend.
[02:56:20.824 --> 02:56:21.965]  Thank you for having me on too, Alex.
[02:56:22.885 --> 02:56:23.986]  We'll be right back tomorrow.
