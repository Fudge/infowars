[00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:06.293]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:08.014]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:09.836]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:11.277]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:12.958]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.598 --> 00:00:17.220]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:21.923]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.023 --> 00:00:23.324]  Music
[00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:55.686]  Campaign to crack down on every American and every person of every faith and every nation and to bring them to justice.
[00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:03.175]  All missions are being executed according to plan, without warning or provocation.
[00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:07.699]  Americans are being swept up in an international dragnet.
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.503]  Thousands of FBI agents are on the trail of other citizens here in America.
[00:01:13.704 --> 00:01:18.007]  It has everything to do with hate and evil and murder and prejudice.
[00:01:18.087 --> 00:01:18.768]  America is strong.
[00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:27.248]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[00:01:27.288 --> 00:01:29.630]  Would you stand up for truth?
[00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.571]  Or would you turn away too?
[00:01:33.032 --> 00:01:38.015]  And then what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:40.076]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[00:01:40.674 --> 00:01:41.754]  We're good to go.
[00:02:01.553 --> 00:02:02.114]  We're good.
[00:02:18.548 --> 00:02:19.208]  We're good to go.
[00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:00.728]  We're good to go.
[00:03:06.648 --> 00:03:09.089]  Now ask yourself, who's the one with the most to gain?
[00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.711]  4911 Martin couldn't stand his name.
[00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:14.412]  Not even waving flags like they lost their mind.
[00:03:14.673 --> 00:03:16.914]  Everybody got opinions, but don't know the time.
[00:03:17.214 --> 00:03:19.655]  Cause America's been took, it's plain to see.
[00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:22.017]  The oldest trick in the book is make an enemy.
[00:03:22.317 --> 00:03:24.638]  A phony evil so the government can do it dirt.
[00:03:24.918 --> 00:03:27.340]  And take away your freedom, lock and load, beat and search.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.001]  Ain't nothing changed, but more colored people locked in prison.
[00:03:30.121 --> 00:03:32.602]  These pigs still beat us, but it seems we forgetting.
[00:03:32.743 --> 00:03:35.104]  But I remember 4 September, how these devils do it.
[00:03:35.744 --> 00:03:36.945]  We're good to go.
[00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:37.846]  We're good to go.
[00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:38.987]  We're good to go.
[00:03:39.007 --> 00:03:39.727]  We're good to go.
[00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.178]  You suck.
[00:04:11.198 --> 00:04:11.743]  You suck.
[00:04:19.588 --> 00:04:22.229]  So now you askin' why my records always come the same?
[00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.929]  Keep it real, ain't no fillers that keep me slingin'.
[00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:27.230]  Might not have seen the glory of the coming of the beast.
[00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.790]  So every story, every word I'm sayin' is a beast.
[00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.551]  See you could witness the Illuminati body count.
[00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:35.231]  Don't be surprised, these is devils that I'm talkin' bout.
[00:04:35.271 --> 00:04:37.712]  You think a couple thousand lies mean they're the killers?
[00:04:37.732 --> 00:04:40.392]  Nigga, I swear to God, we the ones, ain't no villains.
[00:04:40.632 --> 00:04:43.053]  Or any other word they think to demonize the country.
[00:04:43.293 --> 00:04:45.653]  Ain't no terror threat unless approval rate is slumpin'.
[00:04:45.793 --> 00:04:48.494]  So I'ma say it for the record, we the ones that planned it.
[00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:49.414]  Ain't no other country
[00:04:54.397 --> 00:04:57.099]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:07.726]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:10.027]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.387 --> 00:05:18.012]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.726 --> 00:05:25.768]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.168 --> 00:05:37.571]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House probing to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.911 --> 00:05:41.392]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.872 --> 00:05:43.793]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.133 --> 00:05:47.974]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:06.343]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[00:06:06.563 --> 00:06:08.644]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[00:06:08.884 --> 00:06:15.986]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:27.630]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:28.771]  We're good to go.
[00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.810]  803-4438
[00:07:03.058 --> 00:07:07.179]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:09.160]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.722]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:22.124]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:07:22.384 --> 00:07:28.406]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:28.706 --> 00:07:35.092]  With no side effects, the 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[00:07:35.252 --> 00:07:38.796]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[00:07:39.096 --> 00:07:42.799]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:45.522]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:07:45.662 --> 00:07:46.703]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:48.425]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:48.445 --> 00:07:49.726]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.548 --> 00:08:22.849]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the second segment of this Friday edition.
[00:08:23.109 --> 00:08:25.090]  It is the second day of February 2007.
[00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:33.493]  We'll be live here for the next two hours, 51 minutes and a few seconds.
[00:08:34.053 --> 00:08:35.793]  And we're going to have wide open phones today.
[00:08:35.833 --> 00:08:37.494]  We do have a guest for 30 minutes.
[00:08:37.634 --> 00:08:41.395]  She is the president of the Texas Eagle Forum.
[00:08:42.128 --> 00:08:44.770]  Now, what an honest headline from the Associated Press.
[00:09:06.278 --> 00:09:12.540]  It is the drug makers who come in and lobby the state legislatures that lobby the federal government.
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:26.825]  It is the drug makers that make gigantic contributions to the American Medical Association, the American Pediatric Association, the Association of Nurses, the Association of on and on and on.
[00:09:29.215 --> 00:09:29.816]  We're good to go.
[00:09:45.382 --> 00:09:45.742]  We're good to go.
[00:10:07.327 --> 00:10:13.008]  What, 15 years ago it was roughly 18 shots they tried to push.
[00:10:13.308 --> 00:10:18.429]  A decade before that it was just 5 or 6 shots that they tried to claim were mandatory when they weren't.
[00:10:20.189 --> 00:10:23.470]  It was 25 vaccines just a few years ago.
[00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.111]  Now it's 35 vaccines.
[00:10:26.931 --> 00:10:32.772]  And with the new, quote, recommended, which they then intimidate and claim is the law, shots, it's over 40.
[00:10:34.465 --> 00:10:34.605]  I think.
[00:10:34.625 --> 00:10:34.786]  I think.
[00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:48.947]  And to call these vaccines really is a misnomer.
[00:10:48.987 --> 00:10:50.428]  They are filled with mercury.
[00:10:50.468 --> 00:10:55.890]  They are filled with all sorts of deadly byproducts from their manufacture.
[00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:09.455]  Chemicals, poisons, metals, and of course DNA fragments from the different tissues and cultures that they are grown in from dead babies, fetal tissue, right into bovine.
[00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:16.777]  Monkey parts all mixed in and injected into the population.
[00:11:17.517 --> 00:11:26.885]  So remember, every year, in the few months before school starts, they will announce that it's the law all over TV, all over radio, all over print.
[00:11:27.886 --> 00:11:30.569]  You've got to take your shots or you'll be kicked out of school.
[00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.594]  But in reality, the schools just claim it's their policy, then they claim that you violated policy.
[00:11:37.817 --> 00:11:38.938]  We're good to go.
[00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.619]  We're good to go.
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.644]  ABC News reports China's space weapon test could endanger astronauts and satellites.
[00:12:13.664 --> 00:12:19.348]  Engineers say ring of debris is forming an orbit and a marble-sized piece could be dangerous.
[00:12:19.388 --> 00:12:22.210]  We'll get into all the different space weapons, directed energy weapons.
[00:12:22.911 --> 00:12:23.791]  Also, U.S.
[00:12:23.851 --> 00:12:27.034]  issues guidelines in case of flu pandemic.
[00:12:27.474 --> 00:12:28.815]  It's called martial law.
[00:12:29.736 --> 00:12:33.358]  I have a huge stack of hype concerning global warming.
[00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:36.581]  I've been speaking about that in some detail the last few days, but I want to go over it.
[00:12:37.542 --> 00:12:44.089]  In a little bit broader context today, at the bottom of this hour coming up in about 20 minutes.
[00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:58.104]  But first off, I want to announce to you that in the third hour, we're going to play about 20 minutes of questions and answers that I took last night at the UT Union Ballroom.
[00:12:59.273 --> 00:13:05.096]  There beneath the UT Tower, it was an incredible success.
[00:13:05.937 --> 00:13:09.879]  The UT group that sponsored it, we started promoting it on Monday.
[00:13:09.899 --> 00:13:14.141]  And they put out 500 chairs.
[00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:19.664]  Those filled long before 730 when it was supposed to kick off.
[00:13:21.215 --> 00:13:21.716]  We're good to go.
[00:13:36.821 --> 00:13:41.985]  But it did happen, and so I'm sorry that that happened.
[00:13:42.005 --> 00:13:47.470]  900 people there at the UT ballroom with four days promotion.
[00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:53.635]  I tell you, that is really exciting to see those types of numbers of people coming in.
[00:13:53.675 --> 00:13:54.756]  A lot of them were students.
[00:13:55.317 --> 00:13:57.539]  A lot of them were Austinites, old, young.
[00:13:57.579 --> 00:14:00.721]  There were the entire back rows filled with professors.
[00:14:02.263 --> 00:14:05.145]  And I had a chance to go out for Dr. Pianca, the eugenics professor,
[00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:06.851]  Climatologist.
[00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:12.361]  I got a chance to expose the UT Permanent Fund, the 36 plus billion.
[00:14:12.381 --> 00:14:15.747]  That's just one of their big funds that's completely off budget and record.
[00:14:17.196 --> 00:14:17.756]  We're good to go.
[00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:18.297]  We're good to go.
[00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:49.915]  We had to turn away close to 1,000 people at our LA conference that held 1,200.
[00:14:51.596 --> 00:14:53.618]  We had over 1,000 requests for tickets.
[00:14:53.858 --> 00:14:55.159]  We sold out a week before.
[00:14:55.499 --> 00:15:00.643]  We had over 1,000 requests by email and phone for tickets, and then we turned away a couple hundred there.
[00:15:00.663 --> 00:15:08.689]  But we did have several overflow rooms that had TVs with the conference going, so folks got to go in there first.
[00:15:09.554 --> 00:15:22.259]  I tell you, it's just really exciting when every event we have is busting at the seams, whether it's in Chicago or New York City or Los Angeles or Austin, Texas.
[00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:34.443]  We'll see what happens out in a suburb of Phoenix the 23rd, 4th, and 5th of this month with a huge 9-11 conference that I'm going to be the keynote speaker at.
[00:15:35.664 --> 00:15:36.944]  So I hope to see you all there.
[00:15:37.024 --> 00:15:38.725]  But I tell you...
[00:15:39.366 --> 00:15:44.227]  A lot of people would be buoyed, and I was buoyed by the fact that people were involved and awake.
[00:15:45.087 --> 00:15:55.310]  But I am actually humbled and just hope that I do a good job when I'm speaking to such large crowds.
[00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:58.050]  But I have to remember I speak to millions each and every day.
[00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:05.352]  But still, it is heartwarming and humbling to realize that so many people
[00:16:06.978 --> 00:16:12.102]  Are taking seriously, as they should, the issues that we discuss here.
[00:16:13.062 --> 00:16:22.050]  My only frustration is that my limited intellect cannot even articulate the mass of corruption that we are facing.
[00:16:23.257 --> 00:16:29.198]  But again, the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:37.400]  When I launched into an attack against the University of Texas, I was heartened to see there wasn't any booing from the audience.
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:47.983]  And I wasn't attacking UT, the institution, the historical largest university in the world, wealthiest university now in the last few years.
[00:16:48.023 --> 00:16:51.404]  It overtook several other European and U.S.
[00:16:51.464 --> 00:16:52.024]  universities.
[00:16:52.825 --> 00:16:57.387]  The fact is, the university was completely free in the past.
[00:16:58.108 --> 00:17:04.271]  The university owns giant pieces of land all over the state of Texas with natural gas and oil.
[00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:10.554]  They are paid billions and billions of dollars each year out of the Texas Treasury.
[00:17:11.355 --> 00:17:12.896]  And out of the federal treasury.
[00:17:13.896 --> 00:17:17.478]  And on budget, they run giant surpluses.
[00:17:17.518 --> 00:17:38.228]  But they have their comprehensive annual financial reports where they have scores of off-budget funds and investments in toll road companies, in professional sports teams, in a wide, diverse variety of stocks and bonds.
[00:17:39.085 --> 00:17:44.366]  And the regents literally sit in this cathedral-like structure in gold thrones.
[00:17:45.146 --> 00:17:46.887]  And most of them are former CEOs.
[00:17:46.927 --> 00:17:48.107]  It's a revolving door.
[00:17:48.427 --> 00:17:52.208]  Then they leave and become CEOs of other companies that they've invested.
[00:17:53.188 --> 00:17:54.168]  Texans' money.
[00:17:54.888 --> 00:17:55.949]  Texans' tuition.
[00:17:57.289 --> 00:18:01.330]  And to see how they constantly are cutting services to the students.
[00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:02.930]  This is happening everywhere.
[00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.391]  Cities, counties, other universities.
[00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:06.711]  Every institution is doing this.
[00:18:07.775 --> 00:18:19.240]  to see how they are cutting the pay of the librarians to see how they are reducing the pay of the professors and the instructors and their assistants
[00:18:20.262 --> 00:18:28.909]  To see how they're increasing the price of the dorms and increasing the price of parking, just greedily squeezing everyone.
[00:18:29.229 --> 00:18:30.650]  Take St.
[00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.992]  Edwards right here in Austin.
[00:18:33.253 --> 00:18:35.174]  Old, wealthy, small university.
[00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:36.875]  Huge parking lot, free.
[00:18:37.476 --> 00:18:39.578]  They just close it and start charging.
[00:18:40.278 --> 00:18:44.522]  And you go look at their numbers, they've got billions and billions in surplus.
[00:18:44.982 --> 00:18:49.726]  State of Texas, over $400 billion in investments every year.
[00:18:50.643 --> 00:18:51.123]  We're good to go.
[00:18:51.143 --> 00:18:51.423]  I think?
[00:19:07.586 --> 00:19:09.767]  They will not even buy books, do nothing.
[00:19:09.807 --> 00:19:12.028]  They will always claim that they've got a shortfall.
[00:19:12.128 --> 00:19:14.309]  They will always then push more bond proposals.
[00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:25.614]  They will always cut everybody's pay to make the people in the institution think there's no money to support the tax increases and the bonds.
[00:19:26.695 --> 00:19:28.036]  And I'm tired of the scam.
[00:19:28.756 --> 00:19:35.119]  And my film, Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports, exposed, details all of that.
[00:19:36.986 --> 00:19:42.551]  The University of Texas has been turned into a globalist vehicle to destroy the United States.
[00:19:43.671 --> 00:19:44.872]  It has been turned into a vehicle.
[00:19:45.313 --> 00:19:49.536]  Some of their heads of departments are Open Bilderberg Group members and CFR members.
[00:19:49.996 --> 00:19:56.381]  I'll briefly continue with this on the other side, and then we'll go to your calls and cover news around the globe.
[00:19:56.442 --> 00:19:56.862]  Stay with me.
[00:19:59.534 --> 00:19:59.814]  I think.
[00:20:23.397 --> 00:20:33.145]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:20:33.245 --> 00:20:42.153]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:20:42.393 --> 00:20:45.695]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:20:47.777 --> 00:20:50.397]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:20:50.418 --> 00:20:54.718]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:20:54.778 --> 00:20:56.899]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:20:56.959 --> 00:20:58.099]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:16.477 --> 00:21:21.081]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:22.001 --> 00:21:29.267]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:30.268 --> 00:21:33.330]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:38.934]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:21:39.915 --> 00:21:41.196]  Call for your copy today.
[00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:41.416]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:44.694 --> 00:21:53.976]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:21:54.096 --> 00:21:54.796]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.936 --> 00:21:57.296]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:59.717 --> 00:22:02.277]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:02.897 --> 00:22:12.459]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[00:22:13.553 --> 00:22:23.100]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that will let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[00:22:24.121 --> 00:22:29.626]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.
[00:22:30.406 --> 00:22:38.132]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch magazine.
[00:22:38.813 --> 00:22:40.714]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-
[00:22:42.381 --> 00:22:43.062]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:43.082 --> 00:22:43.302]  Call now.
[00:22:43.322 --> 00:22:47.144]  Operators are standing by to take your order for a free subscription.
[00:22:59.193 --> 00:23:01.875]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN news bulletin.
[00:23:02.175 --> 00:23:04.237]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:23:04.477 --> 00:23:06.999]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:23:07.439 --> 00:23:11.822]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[00:23:11.922 --> 00:23:12.503]  Here's why.
[00:23:12.523 --> 00:23:19.167]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:23:19.448 --> 00:23:25.572]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[00:23:25.572 --> 00:23:25.912]  We're not.
[00:23:26.053 --> 00:23:29.797]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[00:23:30.017 --> 00:23:34.261]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[00:23:34.722 --> 00:23:41.890]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:43.051]  Get control.
[00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:43.772]  Get relief.
[00:23:43.973 --> 00:23:44.734]  Get some sleep.
[00:23:45.014 --> 00:23:48.038]  Go to www.outin90.com That's www.outin90.com Or call 877-327-0365 That's 877-327-0365
[00:24:00.247 --> 00:24:05.390]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.452]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:11.033 --> 00:24:17.797]  Every major institution in this nation has been compromised and predominantly taken over.
[00:24:17.877 --> 00:24:21.720]  But predominantly, I mean, there are still remnants of what was good about them left.
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:27.083]  Like big events and public speaking and students being able to bring in whoever they wish to speak.
[00:24:29.227 --> 00:24:34.329]  But you go to the classes and most of the professors or their assistants don't even speak English.
[00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:39.971]  The majority of the engineering students and computer science students aren't even from this country.
[00:24:40.451 --> 00:24:48.594]  And of course they're all being financed and paid by corporate funds to come in and get these educations.
[00:24:49.392 --> 00:24:50.553]  To get this education.
[00:24:50.853 --> 00:24:53.514]  And it's just despicable.
[00:24:53.594 --> 00:25:01.819]  People need to know what your universities, what your governmental institutions, what your quasi-governmental institutions are doing.
[00:25:01.899 --> 00:25:09.624]  They have worked together to set up a climate to take control of the government and to take the taxing mechanisms to fund themselves.
[00:25:09.684 --> 00:25:18.269]  And now they're in the final phase of giving themselves governmental power while at the same time reducing all of the services that you and I
[00:25:18.849 --> 00:25:21.370]  And our ancestors paid to build.
[00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:24.251]  And that's the bottom line.
[00:25:24.271 --> 00:25:27.972]  And they give you some symbol of your pride at a university.
[00:25:28.272 --> 00:25:35.975]  A football game you can go pay tons of money for and sit and watch and then that becomes the pride of your university.
[00:25:36.495 --> 00:25:37.975]  And I'm not knocking the football.
[00:25:38.015 --> 00:25:46.378]  I'm just saying it becomes a replacement and it becomes the center of everything as you lose everything that really matters and everything you're really paying for.
[00:25:47.978 --> 00:25:49.418]  Okay, I'm done talking about that.
[00:25:49.438 --> 00:25:51.239]  I'm going to get into the drug maker.
[00:25:51.259 --> 00:25:54.219]  Wants a law to require STD shot.
[00:25:55.839 --> 00:25:56.740]  We'll be breaking that down.
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:01.280]  Also, a big section on global warming as this thing hits fever pitch.
[00:26:02.721 --> 00:26:08.142]  The Bush administration seeks $245 billion for additional war funding.
[00:26:08.222 --> 00:26:10.902]  I mean, it goes from a couple hundred billion to $245 billion.
[00:26:10.962 --> 00:26:12.322]  This is a supplemental package.
[00:26:12.762 --> 00:26:14.963]  When previous supplemental packages were around $70 billion.
[00:26:16.744 --> 00:26:21.508]  And we'll also get into several other reports concerning the war drums with Iran.
[00:26:21.928 --> 00:26:23.309]  Right now, let's go to your calls.
[00:26:23.409 --> 00:26:25.150]  Peter in New York, you're on the air.
[00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:25.871]  Thanks for holding.
[00:26:27.552 --> 00:26:28.753]  Alex, this is Peter from New York.
[00:26:28.993 --> 00:26:29.293]  Yes, sir.
[00:26:29.333 --> 00:26:29.693]  Go ahead.
[00:26:29.993 --> 00:26:30.414]  How are you?
[00:26:30.614 --> 00:26:30.834]  Good.
[00:26:31.575 --> 00:26:33.996]  Long-time fan, first-time caller.
[00:26:34.917 --> 00:26:39.140]  I have big-time concerns about the direction that the 9-11 truth movement is going in.
[00:26:40.541 --> 00:26:46.145]  I think we've done a great job at exposing the lies, the anomalies, the inconsistencies, but...
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:56.484]  We don't have much time before they launch another attack upon us, and we really need to get to the facts to who was behind these attacks.
[00:26:57.364 --> 00:26:58.284]  Who are the people?
[00:26:58.364 --> 00:26:59.285]  Who are the principals?
[00:26:59.365 --> 00:27:00.165]  Who was involved?
[00:27:00.785 --> 00:27:02.246]  It's time to start naming names.
[00:27:04.967 --> 00:27:05.527]  Well, go ahead.
[00:27:05.547 --> 00:27:06.508]  Who do you think is behind it?
[00:27:06.548 --> 00:27:06.988]  Name names.
[00:27:07.668 --> 00:27:09.769]  Well, I mean, let's think about it here.
[00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:14.310]  The Bush administration was only in office for about nine months at that point.
[00:27:14.591 --> 00:27:14.851]  Yes.
[00:27:15.231 --> 00:27:15.571]  Okay?
[00:27:16.551 --> 00:27:24.343]  Nobody that I can really point to who's prominent in the movement right now has talked about involvement by the Clinton administration.
[00:27:25.085 --> 00:27:31.595]  Namely, people like John Deutch, the traitor who sold the Al-Qaeda database to industry.
[00:27:32.929 --> 00:27:36.930]  Well, there's no separation between the Clinton administration and the Bushes.
[00:27:37.391 --> 00:27:39.211]  That's another illusion.
[00:27:39.271 --> 00:27:42.352]  It's the same exact technicians and individuals.
[00:27:42.772 --> 00:27:47.854]  They just put on this good cop, bad cop, carnival barker sideshow.
[00:27:48.434 --> 00:27:50.415]  Right, and I agree with that.
[00:27:52.415 --> 00:27:57.577]  Can you point to any resources, whether they're online or publications or journals?
[00:27:57.972 --> 00:28:02.954]  That have really touched on naming names and trying to get the ball rolling legally here.
[00:28:03.114 --> 00:28:03.894]  Sure.
[00:28:04.074 --> 00:28:10.436]  We have 9-11 archives on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with whole sections.
[00:28:10.976 --> 00:28:11.937]  We're talking 20, 30 articles apiece.
[00:28:13.437 --> 00:28:14.057]  We're good to go.
[00:28:32.003 --> 00:28:34.385]  And so, I mean, that's ongoing there.
[00:28:34.505 --> 00:28:41.569]  Whenever Sudan and Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia wanted to arrest Bin Laden and hand him over, Clinton said no.
[00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.151]  That's all on record.
[00:28:43.191 --> 00:28:46.193]  It's just exact same policies were continued.
[00:28:47.093 --> 00:28:48.554]  And I appreciate your call.
[00:28:48.574 --> 00:28:50.576]  I mean, we're talking about who's involved in 9-11.
[00:28:51.856 --> 00:28:57.360]  Clearly, you've got U.S., British, Israeli intelligence agencies' fingerprints all over.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.521]  And they always work together.
[00:28:58.561 --> 00:29:00.102]  It's really one intelligence agency.
[00:29:00.928 --> 00:29:08.630]  And then you've clearly got private defense contractors who are basically the backbone of the infrastructure clearly involved.
[00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:20.092]  You've got Dick Cheney in June, a couple months before 9-11, taking the shoot-down powers that the generals and admirals and their designate colonels and majors who had shoot-down power.
[00:29:20.112 --> 00:29:22.212]  We have that shoot-down power being taken away.
[00:29:22.252 --> 00:29:26.193]  We have Cheney in the White House bunker, later leaving the side R in complete control.
[00:29:26.989 --> 00:29:30.031]  Clearly ordering the stand down, so he's clearly involved.
[00:29:30.631 --> 00:29:31.272]  And so we know.
[00:29:31.292 --> 00:29:36.135]  I mean, it's the shadow government, which isn't even shadow anymore.
[00:29:36.155 --> 00:29:37.336]  They call it the shadow government.
[00:29:39.037 --> 00:29:42.759]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:29:42.979 --> 00:29:46.802]  With more of your calls, stay with us.
[00:29:49.324 --> 00:29:50.244]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.724 --> 00:29:52.325]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.246 --> 00:29:55.928]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.332 --> 00:30:00.373]  How are you feeling today?
[00:30:29.392 --> 00:30:30.413]  We'll see you next time.
[00:30:59.364 --> 00:31:02.947]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:31:03.207 --> 00:31:04.068]  Look no further.
[00:31:04.368 --> 00:31:06.950]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:15.877]  Hundreds of titles from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:31:16.037 --> 00:31:17.738]  You can order everything you need on the web.
[00:31:18.018 --> 00:31:18.639]  We're good to go.
[00:31:33.561 --> 00:31:33.961]  We're good to go.
[00:31:34.001 --> 00:31:34.441]  We're good to go.
[00:31:34.461 --> 00:31:34.821]  We're good to go.
[00:32:00.197 --> 00:32:02.239]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:11.808]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:32:12.249 --> 00:32:19.456]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:32:20.163 --> 00:32:24.024]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with Lace-Med Inc.'
[00:32:23.984 --> 00:32:25.665]  's patented methodology.
[00:32:26.145 --> 00:32:36.988]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:32:37.728 --> 00:32:39.789]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:32:40.289 --> 00:32:41.709]  For more information, call 702-953-0222
[00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:48.772]  Call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:32:48.792 --> 00:32:49.653]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:32:49.673 --> 00:32:52.134]  Oh, I really should have built a wall
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.743]  Mother, should I run for president?
[00:33:18.843 --> 00:33:24.647]  Mother, should I trust the government?
[00:33:52.765 --> 00:34:08.810]  Is it just a waste of time?
[00:34:14.898 --> 00:34:23.221]  Hush now baby, baby, don't you cry.
[00:34:23.322 --> 00:34:28.804]  Mama's gonna make all of your nightmares come true.
[00:34:30.012 --> 00:34:30.773]  Welcome back.
[00:34:57.183 --> 00:35:00.584]  Glad you joined us on this Friday edition, continuing with your phone calls.
[00:35:03.404 --> 00:35:10.167]  Let's go ahead and speak with Daz in the UK, then Scott, Rodney, CH, Tim and others.
[00:35:10.247 --> 00:35:11.147]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:35:11.167 --> 00:35:13.508]  Hello, what's going on, Alex?
[00:35:13.688 --> 00:35:20.870]  I just wanted to get your opinions on the increase of atheists in the media and the blasphemy challenge.
[00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:24.831]  Did you say the increase in atheists?
[00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:26.091]  Yeah.
[00:35:27.092 --> 00:35:30.416]  And the Blasphemy Challenge, fill me in on what that is.
[00:35:31.537 --> 00:35:33.859]  Basically, where people denounce God on YouTube.
[00:35:33.879 --> 00:35:38.444]  I was wondering whether you thought there was any underlying plan behind this stuff.
[00:35:40.025 --> 00:35:45.991]  Well, there really is, because if you don't believe in a higher power, and if you don't believe in a higher moral...
[00:35:48.271 --> 00:36:06.175]  Benchmark, then really it makes man God, and that makes the people who are in control God, because the people certainly don't have the power and control to the level we need to, and so hence, that makes the New World Order controllers God.
[00:36:07.035 --> 00:36:15.017]  And they've told people in the universities for 150 years that religion's caused all the wars, and that's not true.
[00:36:15.857 --> 00:36:16.817]  It's been corrupt religion
[00:36:17.319 --> 00:36:18.259]  We're good to go.
[00:36:40.775 --> 00:36:41.235]  Of this.
[00:36:41.255 --> 00:36:46.036]  And you have to look at a tree's fruits to be able to gauge it.
[00:36:46.736 --> 00:36:48.617]  But it's the trendy, cool thing to do.
[00:36:48.637 --> 00:36:50.597]  You know, Nietzsche, God is dead.
[00:36:50.617 --> 00:36:52.637]  Of course, he was totally insane.
[00:36:52.657 --> 00:36:55.318]  And that's what they're into.
[00:36:55.378 --> 00:37:05.840]  But if you can't look at the hundreds of billions of galaxies photographed by Hubble, if you can't look at the night sky, if you can't look at a tree, if you can't look at the design in the human hand, the human eye,
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.400]  We're good to go.
[00:37:28.306 --> 00:37:29.467]  We're good to go.
[00:37:29.487 --> 00:37:30.869]  We're good to go.
[00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:50.531]  We're good to go.
[00:38:02.049 --> 00:38:02.790]  We're good to go.
[00:38:24.293 --> 00:38:32.137]  And so those pushing the atheist agenda, I don't mean they're low-level minions, but those above it promulgating it, are very wicked indeed.
[00:38:32.537 --> 00:38:38.780]  And so I would simply also point that out to people that have said, as fools, that there is no God.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.621]  Okay.
[00:38:40.741 --> 00:38:41.901]  Thanks for your opinions there, Alex.
[00:38:42.842 --> 00:38:43.542]  Anything else, sir?
[00:38:43.562 --> 00:38:51.546]  Yeah, I'd just like to ask what you think of some of the 9-11 sites that claim...
[00:38:57.732 --> 00:39:01.193]  Well, let me try to answer that and I appreciate your call.
[00:39:01.313 --> 00:39:03.695]  In the interest of time I can't spend too much time on it.
[00:39:05.395 --> 00:39:12.399]  I would imagine, I should have asked, you're talking about some of the sites that claim to dissect
[00:39:13.571 --> 00:39:23.099]  The fact that we're saying 9-11 was orchestrated by criminal elements of the military-industrial complex, and what I have found they do, well, there's now sites debunking them.
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:30.724]  And what they count on is that people aren't going to do research on what they're saying, the claims they're making.
[00:39:32.786 --> 00:39:34.247]  And they do this over and over again.
[00:39:34.267 --> 00:39:37.770]  And they do several different things.
[00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:40.111]  Well, they do a bunch of things, but two or three main things.
[00:39:40.191 --> 00:39:40.752]  Number one...
[00:39:42.287 --> 00:39:42.647]  I don't know.
[00:40:08.647 --> 00:40:11.748]  Those that promulgate that no planes hit the towers.
[00:40:12.108 --> 00:40:18.731]  You notice the people that say that are on TV every single week, whereas I might get on national television once every two years.
[00:40:21.092 --> 00:40:29.595]  So they will attribute any kooky theory out there to the entire 9-11 truth movement.
[00:40:30.055 --> 00:40:31.356]  That's number one.
[00:40:32.076 --> 00:40:36.418]  And they will many times, as popular mechanics did, attribute bad research
[00:40:37.168 --> 00:40:46.533]  Or things that are patently disprovable to myself or other prominent, serious, credible researchers.
[00:40:46.573 --> 00:40:50.976]  They will not attempt to debunk that the hijackers were trained at U.S.
[00:40:51.016 --> 00:40:51.816]  military bases.
[00:40:52.036 --> 00:40:55.298]  Publicly available, in triplicate, absolute fact.
[00:40:56.255 --> 00:40:56.896]  We're good to go.
[00:41:15.191 --> 00:41:18.013]  They won't get me on national TV and say, Alex, you're a liar!
[00:41:18.093 --> 00:41:19.654]  Gulf of Tonkin wasn't staged!
[00:41:20.034 --> 00:41:21.955]  Because Gulf of Tonkin is now admitted to be staged.
[00:41:22.296 --> 00:41:26.198]  Or they won't get me on national TV and say, Alex, because first I proved they've done it before.
[00:41:26.898 --> 00:41:33.382]  Alex, you know, our government didn't stage terror attacks in Iran to overthrow Mohammad Mosaddegh.
[00:41:33.422 --> 00:41:35.203]  No, it's declassified, admitted they did.
[00:41:35.284 --> 00:41:37.165]  The guy that ran the op wrote a book in 99.
[00:41:37.445 --> 00:41:39.466]  It was declassified shortly after.
[00:41:40.046 --> 00:41:41.187]  The After Action Reports.
[00:41:42.748 --> 00:41:43.248]  They don't...
[00:41:44.924 --> 00:41:49.946]  They don't go after us on the real evidence we've put out.
[00:41:50.286 --> 00:41:52.847]  There's over 600 pieces, 600 smoking guns.
[00:41:54.487 --> 00:42:00.749]  Years ago, I did whole three-hour programs where I would just quickly read one smoking gun and move to the next and couldn't get all 600 in.
[00:42:00.809 --> 00:42:08.192]  I mean, I would have like four or five big files busting open, four inches thick of just news articles and documents each file.
[00:42:09.752 --> 00:42:11.993]  Can't cover it all in one show.
[00:42:14.202 --> 00:42:16.483]  Also, they will then just flat out lie.
[00:42:17.163 --> 00:42:19.604]  And there's many examples of this.
[00:42:21.685 --> 00:42:24.846]  But first off, you have to look who the chief debunkers are.
[00:42:27.548 --> 00:42:30.289]  Two years ago, I get a call.
[00:42:31.049 --> 00:42:32.890]  Hey, it's Popular Mechanics.
[00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:36.471]  I'm Ben Chertoff.
[00:42:37.472 --> 00:42:40.593]  I'm the managing editor of this story.
[00:42:41.448 --> 00:42:43.489]  And these are the reporters I want you to talk to.
[00:42:44.009 --> 00:42:45.530]  And I said, is this a hit piece?
[00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:46.510]  Even if it is, it's fine.
[00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:47.111]  I'll do the interview.
[00:42:47.131 --> 00:42:47.911]  I'd just like to know.
[00:42:48.331 --> 00:42:49.532]  No, I'll give you my word.
[00:42:49.992 --> 00:42:51.253]  This is not a hit piece.
[00:42:52.093 --> 00:42:53.734]  And then I get to talk to the reporters.
[00:42:54.554 --> 00:42:56.015]  And they would say, well, what about this?
[00:42:56.075 --> 00:42:56.515]  What about that?
[00:42:56.535 --> 00:43:00.037]  And they would always bring up things that were disproven or you couldn't prove or that were kooky.
[00:43:00.057 --> 00:43:01.718]  And I'd say, well, this is your theory.
[00:43:01.738 --> 00:43:03.038]  And I'd say, no, that's not mine.
[00:43:03.638 --> 00:43:07.100]  I want to talk about the crimp and the squibs in Building 7 not hit by a plane.
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:08.901]  I want to talk about steel temperatures.
[00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:11.331]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:43:11.771 --> 00:43:16.855]  And it was so bad, I thought it was for the first time out of hundreds of interviews I'd done for print, I thought it was fake.
[00:43:16.935 --> 00:43:21.759]  I thought it was some group of lawyers posing as reporters.
[00:43:21.839 --> 00:43:22.660]  Something was going on.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:33.009]  So I called Megs, the head of Popular Mechanics, who'd just gotten in at that time, and I put a message in saying, is this a real story?
[00:43:33.749 --> 00:43:37.552]  And I got a call back, yes, indeed, this is a real story, and you have our word, it's not a hit piece.
[00:43:37.893 --> 00:43:39.134]  We're just looking at both sides.
[00:43:40.532 --> 00:43:41.333]  And then it came out.
[00:43:43.275 --> 00:43:53.684]  And they were going to put in there, attributing an article I didn't write that we linked to on Prison Planet as something I'd written, and I threatened them.
[00:43:53.744 --> 00:43:55.746]  I said, you're going to get litigated against if you do that.
[00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:56.987]  So they did take that out of the story.
[00:43:57.027 --> 00:43:58.649]  But here's a backside example.
[00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:04.774]  There was a report about seismographs picking up clear evidence of explosions.
[00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:06.096]  And that's real evidence.
[00:44:07.819 --> 00:44:10.021]  That that's a real piece of evidence.
[00:44:10.521 --> 00:44:15.625]  But instead of debunking the piece of evidence, that was written by another reporter for American Free Press.
[00:44:16.686 --> 00:44:26.573]  So what they did is they called me, said that I wrote it, and said we called the people at this university and at the U.S.
[00:44:26.593 --> 00:44:30.175]  Geological Survey, two different groups, and they said you never interviewed them.
[00:44:31.116 --> 00:44:32.837]  And I went, of course not.
[00:44:33.998 --> 00:44:34.979]  Did you read the story?
[00:44:37.047 --> 00:44:39.630]  We just posted it in our format.
[00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:41.453]  That's a newspaper.
[00:44:42.173 --> 00:44:43.215]  Did you call them?
[00:44:43.956 --> 00:44:44.537]  No.
[00:44:44.557 --> 00:44:49.403]  But they didn't do that with me, but with other people they played that trick.
[00:44:51.526 --> 00:44:53.449]  And then in the article they say...
[00:44:54.597 --> 00:45:12.862]  In the subsequent book they wrote last year, they said, and contrary to what they say, no jet was ever intercepted in the years that NORAD was set up, since 57 on until 2000 with Payne Stewart.
[00:45:15.703 --> 00:45:21.865]  And the 9-11 kooks, they say that hundreds and hundreds were intercepted.
[00:45:22.489 --> 00:45:31.919]  And they then quoted some major, the NORAD spokesman, at a press conference after 9-11 saying they'd never intercepted planes except for Payne Stewart.
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:40.829]  But then we did a Google search and pulled up articles from 2000 with him bragging about how they intercepted, what, 168 times in the year before that.
[00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:44.433]  The very same person in Reuters.
[00:45:45.885 --> 00:45:46.906]  And we wrote an article about it.
[00:45:47.666 --> 00:45:49.447]  So that's the type of things they do.
[00:45:50.468 --> 00:45:58.132]  But more than just breaking down their lies, why not look at Hearst Publishing, which I continue to talk about on air.
[00:45:58.372 --> 00:46:00.413]  I want to do a big expose on.
[00:46:02.214 --> 00:46:12.960]  You know how Horson Wells, who was a rising superstar in Hollywood, you know how he got blackballed.
[00:46:13.781 --> 00:46:15.582]  It's the famous movie Citizen Kane.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.322]  It's about Hearst Publishing and William Randolph Hearst.
[00:46:22.743 --> 00:46:41.012]  And I remember in college, just in the first textbook in basic radio, television, and film, there were chapters about yellow journalism was attributed, and it got its name for Hearst Publishing, with 500 and something newspapers and book publishing in this country.
[00:46:42.919 --> 00:46:55.022]  And in the Spanish-American War in 1898, Hearst bragged that he helped start that war with the government and helped put out the law that they blew up the main, the battleship, the main.
[00:46:58.602 --> 00:47:02.343]  He just literally helped run this country.
[00:47:02.363 --> 00:47:04.724]  He helped get the Federal Reserve put into place.
[00:47:04.764 --> 00:47:19.950]  He would do things like print that the bankers were against the Federal Reserve Act, and people were fooled and thought, well, if the bankers were against the Federal Reserve Act, which they were actually financing and paying Hirsch to publish, then everybody ran out and supported it and got passed.
[00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:22.511]  Please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[00:47:24.258 --> 00:47:27.340]  And then Hearst has been involved in yellow journalism ever since.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.802]  They are the original Fox News on steroids.
[00:47:31.162 --> 00:47:33.943]  They make Rupert Murdoch look like a choir boy.
[00:47:34.764 --> 00:47:41.708]  It's been a government amalgamation with industry ever since it got started.
[00:47:44.389 --> 00:47:45.630]  That's how they operate.
[00:47:47.259 --> 00:47:55.046]  And so, Hearst Publishing comes out and attacks me and others and lies about us and builds straw men.
[00:47:56.087 --> 00:48:00.851]  Again, they make false claims about what we've said and then attack those false claims.
[00:48:00.871 --> 00:48:01.532]  It's a straw man.
[00:48:01.872 --> 00:48:03.133]  You don't attack the real man.
[00:48:03.153 --> 00:48:04.054]  You attack the straw man.
[00:48:04.274 --> 00:48:07.997]  You build something you claim is the person and then you attack that.
[00:48:09.238 --> 00:48:10.440]  They didn't just have to do straw man.
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:14.163]  They did attack kooks and disinfo people and folks that just haven't done their research.
[00:48:15.436 --> 00:48:18.998]  And then by guilt, by association, try to demonize the entire movement.
[00:48:20.759 --> 00:48:32.446]  But then we learned that Benjamin Chertoff, the managing editor, was a close family member of Homeland Security Director Michael Chertoff.
[00:48:34.187 --> 00:48:40.651]  And he got calls by reporters and lied and said, I'm not related to him, I don't know him.
[00:48:41.091 --> 00:48:43.673]  But then reporters called his mommy,
[00:48:45.675 --> 00:48:48.456]  Benjamin Chertoff's mommy, and she said, of course we're family.
[00:48:49.096 --> 00:48:51.857]  Of course, he's first cousins, and he comes over for dinner.
[00:48:53.857 --> 00:48:54.497]  Oh, yes.
[00:48:55.357 --> 00:49:00.259]  And then later, they had to backtrack and say, okay, we're related, and yeah, we've met, and yeah, okay.
[00:49:01.999 --> 00:49:03.059]  I mean, that's how these things work.
[00:49:03.079 --> 00:49:04.260]  This is all hereditary.
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:08.221]  Norman Schwarzkopf, dad, carries out the terror attacks on Iran.
[00:49:08.561 --> 00:49:12.282]  Norman Schwarzkopf ends up being the head of the military operations over there.
[00:49:12.442 --> 00:49:13.202]  He grew up over there.
[00:49:13.222 --> 00:49:13.802]  He speaks Arabic.
[00:49:14.938 --> 00:49:16.599]  The Bushes, three generations of them.
[00:49:16.679 --> 00:49:17.539]  Now it's going to be four.
[00:49:18.919 --> 00:49:21.360]  It's the same thing with the Chertoffs.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:29.382]  Chertoff's grandfather and grandmother were founders of Mossad.
[00:49:29.402 --> 00:49:32.403]  He's an Israeli citizen.
[00:49:34.204 --> 00:49:35.784]  I mean, this is just how it works.
[00:49:37.004 --> 00:49:42.346]  And I tell you, it's a little scary to have the Chertoff family writing hit pieces on me.
[00:49:43.471 --> 00:49:44.272]  We're good to go.
[00:49:44.712 --> 00:49:45.513]  We're good to go.
[00:49:46.254 --> 00:49:46.954]  We're good to go.
[00:50:05.561 --> 00:50:08.363]  Hearst Publishing, William Randolph Hearst.
[00:50:08.603 --> 00:50:13.486]  You know, you always make the joke that next to ugly in the dictionary, it's your picture.
[00:50:13.586 --> 00:50:18.048]  Or next to, you know, stupid in the encyclopedia, it's your name.
[00:50:18.709 --> 00:50:28.274]  Well, literally, literally, when you say yellow journalism, literally, it says Hearst Publishing.
[00:50:32.557 --> 00:50:32.797]  So...
[00:50:34.497 --> 00:50:35.297]  Long answer.
[00:50:35.417 --> 00:50:37.839]  I could talk for hours about it, but that really is a short answer.
[00:50:37.859 --> 00:50:41.460]  But in the time we've got, it's got to be as much as I say about it.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:47.823]  Scott, Rodney, C.H., Tim, I'm going to accelerate through your calls.
[00:50:47.843 --> 00:50:49.223]  We've got a guest coming on for 30 minutes.
[00:50:49.544 --> 00:50:50.744]  Then I'll get into global warming.
[00:50:51.404 --> 00:50:52.405]  We really need to talk about this.
[00:50:52.425 --> 00:50:53.926]  There's a full court press right now.

[00:52:23.915 --> 00:52:35.421]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.

[00:54:28.056 --> 00:54:32.818]  Welcome back.
[00:54:34.539 --> 00:54:38.421]  You know, Rodney is a long-time caller here in Austin.
[00:54:39.282 --> 00:54:41.002]  And I hadn't talked to him in three or four months.
[00:54:41.022 --> 00:54:43.183]  I think he hadn't called in longer than that.
[00:54:43.223 --> 00:54:44.364]  I was going to him next.
[00:54:45.224 --> 00:54:47.185]  And Rodney, you turkey, you just hung up.
[00:54:47.225 --> 00:54:48.126]  You called back in!
[00:54:48.146 --> 00:54:48.186]  Ha!
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:52.982]  You get addicted to old-time callers.
[00:54:53.042 --> 00:54:54.043]  You like talking to them.
[00:54:54.503 --> 00:54:59.327]  Let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Colorado.
[00:54:59.347 --> 00:55:00.027]  You're on the air.
[00:55:00.067 --> 00:55:00.428]  Welcome.
[00:55:00.888 --> 00:55:01.508]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:55:01.769 --> 00:55:02.129]  Good, sir.
[00:55:02.149 --> 00:55:04.731]  I have a question about the Federal Reserve.
[00:55:07.213 --> 00:55:14.538]  Is it true that they supposedly refund the taxes all but a 6% dividend to the Treasury, or how does that work?
[00:55:15.851 --> 00:55:32.846]  Well, it depends, because they've made a lot of that secret, but basically, and Ronald Reagan commissioned a big report on this in 1981, a congressional report, not one cent of federal income tax goes to pay for the federal government's operation.
[00:55:33.559 --> 00:55:34.320]  We're good to go.
[00:55:48.550 --> 00:55:48.831]  Thank you.
[00:56:04.051 --> 00:56:11.095]  And so all the other zeros and ones that are in these computers, that is issued and controlled by the Federal Reserve.
[00:56:11.175 --> 00:56:21.440]  And they tell the other banks, which aren't part of the actual Federal Reserve stockholders, but are under the Federal Reserve system, how much they can loan out under the fractional reserve banking system.
[00:56:21.761 --> 00:56:24.122]  And usually it's at about 1 to 10 ratio.
[00:56:24.382 --> 00:56:25.302]  That is when you deposit $1.
[00:56:26.623 --> 00:56:30.145]  I heard it was $7, but I guess $10 is not that big of a difference.
[00:56:30.505 --> 00:56:36.127]  That just means that there's just all this money that doesn't really exist.
[00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:51.542]  Yes.
[00:56:51.722 --> 00:56:57.167]  If there was a run on the bank, let's say you got $50,000 in there for college funds, and you tried to go get that.
[00:56:57.227 --> 00:57:00.830]  Now, if you went and got it when nobody was there, and there wasn't a run, you'd have no problem.
[00:57:01.471 --> 00:57:05.234]  But a few years ago, it was 3% actual currency.
[00:57:05.575 --> 00:57:08.077]  But then they doubled the money supply, so it was 1.5%.
[00:57:08.938 --> 00:57:13.362]  And then almost a year ago, the new Fed chief, Edward Bernanke, came in.
[00:57:13.422 --> 00:57:13.983]  He said, well...
[00:57:14.703 --> 00:57:16.983]  Greenspan doubled the money supply in the last six years.
[00:57:17.003 --> 00:57:18.424]  I'm going to double it in the next two.
[00:57:18.824 --> 00:57:22.724]  Then he made the money supply number secret for the first time since 1913.
[00:57:23.225 --> 00:57:24.225]  So now we don't know.
[00:57:25.045 --> 00:57:27.645]  But it's probably below 1% now.
[00:57:28.025 --> 00:57:29.126]  The last number we have is 1.5.
[00:57:29.226 --> 00:57:31.206]  One more question on that.
[00:57:31.626 --> 00:57:40.588]  Is it true that, and this would be another way they'd make a lot of money, is it true that they actually just, the Fed has the cost of printing the money and then lends it to the U.S.
[00:57:40.628 --> 00:57:42.528]  at face value, or is that inaccurate?
[00:57:44.151 --> 00:57:50.014]  No, what happens is, it only costs, what is it, like four cents to print a dollar?
[00:57:50.455 --> 00:57:52.776]  And they lend it at face value, or true or not true?
[00:57:53.556 --> 00:58:11.506]  No, how it works is, to be able to issue the money, debt is created, and then bonds and different types of notes are then sold on the international market, and the debt is bought, then the income tax is used to pay those people back on their bonds.
[00:58:13.823 --> 00:58:14.063]  All right.
[00:58:14.484 --> 00:58:14.824]  Thank you.
[00:58:15.104 --> 00:58:16.085]  Does that make sense?
[00:58:16.886 --> 00:58:20.169]  Yeah, I mean, it may be a little bit more clear, but yeah.
[00:58:20.189 --> 00:58:24.113]  Maybe I should do a whole show on the Federal Reserve and then get a bunch of experts and guests on about it.
[00:58:24.833 --> 00:58:27.355]  Basically, it's designed to get societies in debt.
[00:58:27.436 --> 00:58:30.358]  It's made where a nation will go into debt.
[00:58:30.839 --> 00:58:32.200]  It is a law of mathematics.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:35.743]  It is designed to bankrupt you and make you dependent.
[00:58:36.043 --> 00:58:37.545]  It is financial matrix.
[00:58:39.565 --> 00:58:39.685]  Dad!
[00:58:39.705 --> 00:58:39.785]  Dad!
[00:58:55.831 --> 00:59:00.013]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:59:00.673 --> 00:59:01.494]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.234 --> 00:59:03.134]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:03.154 --> 00:59:07.756]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:07.996 --> 00:59:12.118]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:13.699 --> 00:59:21.362]  Targeting New World Order infrastructure, blasting through their lives, waking up indigenous populations globally.
[00:59:22.023 --> 00:59:25.264]  Resistance is mounting, exponentially growing.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.121]  The final collision is on course.
[00:59:30.922 --> 00:59:32.342]  Increase acceleration.
[00:59:33.483 --> 00:59:34.763]  Pull out all the stops.
[00:59:34.883 --> 00:59:36.284]  Scream from the rooftops.
[00:59:36.864 --> 00:59:38.225]  Talk to everybody you know.
[00:59:38.405 --> 00:59:39.385]  Intensify.
[00:59:39.726 --> 00:59:40.966]  We're at the crossroads.
[00:59:41.006 --> 00:59:42.087]  We're at flashpoint.
[00:59:42.347 --> 00:59:43.287]  We're going in.
[00:59:43.487 --> 00:59:44.928]  Prepare for impact!
[00:59:47.589 --> 00:59:48.549]  We're going to win!
[00:59:48.569 --> 00:59:52.631]  It isn't a fight we want, but it's a fight we're in.
[00:59:52.651 --> 00:59:53.912]  And it's a fight we've got to...
[00:59:55.231 --> 00:59:57.432]  Engage in, so we might as well take them down.
[01:00:01.795 --> 01:00:02.796]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:00:03.136 --> 01:00:18.886]  We are getting a guest on here in a few minutes, the president of the Texas Eagle Forum, Kathy Adams, to discuss a recent attempt by pharmacological company Merck to write a Texas law that requires girls as young as 11 to receive the company's new cervical cancer vaccine.
[01:00:19.406 --> 01:00:22.388]  Now, there is nowhere in the nation, they've also tried to get it passed in Texas,
[01:00:23.405 --> 01:00:29.889]  District of Criminals, District of Columbia, D.C., to actually make a law.
[01:00:29.909 --> 01:00:32.431]  Because, see, they're always having to prance around and claim it's the law.
[01:00:32.451 --> 01:00:33.171]  There is no law.
[01:00:34.272 --> 01:00:36.654]  And they want to make hundreds of vaccines mandatory.
[01:00:37.114 --> 01:00:45.599]  Now it's gone from just a few you took 20 years ago, as we talked about earlier, to now they want you to take 44, 45, and they tell you it's the law.
[01:00:45.759 --> 01:00:46.540]  It is not the law.
[01:00:48.132 --> 01:00:48.552]  We're good to go.
[01:00:48.592 --> 01:00:48.792]  I think?
[01:01:11.847 --> 01:01:19.952]  Over my dead body will you inject your bioweapons and your sterilization compounds and your cancer viruses.
[01:01:20.012 --> 01:01:22.253]  And this is a live cancer virus, by the way.
[01:01:23.094 --> 01:01:25.375]  We're always telling you they put cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[01:01:25.836 --> 01:01:34.681]  Now they give you a cancer virus that's had its DNA chain manipulated inside its protein envelope.
[01:01:37.382 --> 01:01:43.764]  And they want to give that to every girl, and all over the country they're going to the legislatures to try to pass a law.
[01:01:44.124 --> 01:01:44.904]  Let me say it again.
[01:01:46.004 --> 01:01:50.265]  When hell freezes over, will this happen?
[01:01:50.846 --> 01:01:53.746]  When I am six feet under, this will happen.
[01:01:54.266 --> 01:01:55.907]  And I hope you have the same attitude.
[01:01:55.947 --> 01:01:56.607]  But you know what?
[01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:04.169]  Even if they're not able to pass this law, they'll still say it's the law, and your daughters will line up,
[01:02:05.023 --> 01:02:05.363]  We're good to go.
[01:02:05.383 --> 01:02:05.824]  We're good to go.
[01:02:30.217 --> 01:02:30.877]  Fantastic.
[01:02:30.917 --> 01:02:32.258]  Let's go ahead and go to Kathy Adams.
[01:02:32.278 --> 01:02:32.878]  We're about to break.
[01:02:32.918 --> 01:02:33.399]  We'll come back.
[01:02:33.459 --> 01:02:36.020]  Just do one 15-minute segment with her and let her go.
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:36.801]  She's got to dive.
[01:02:36.861 --> 01:02:37.401]  She's going on.
[01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:38.181]  I'm very envious.
[01:02:38.541 --> 01:02:39.942]  The beautiful waters of Cozumel.
[01:02:40.903 --> 01:02:43.264]  You might see some hammerheads down there, Kathy.
[01:02:45.742 --> 01:02:46.543]  I just may.
[01:02:46.823 --> 01:02:59.308]  But I think that what's going on in the United States, especially right now in Texas with this Merck vaccine, this HPV vaccine, that is not even recommended by the American College of Pediatricians, is unreal.
[01:02:59.348 --> 01:03:03.650]  And yet our governor is comparing it to a polio vaccine.
[01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:04.830]  No way!
[01:03:05.851 --> 01:03:09.392]  Well, what do you expect from open border, toll road, New World Order, Perry?
[01:03:10.253 --> 01:03:13.654]  Well, I think that the fact that this HPV vaccine...
[01:03:15.012 --> 01:03:28.659]  That between 1955 and 1992 cervical cancer deaths in American women dropped by 74% due to pap smears says that this is absolutely unnecessary and all you have to do is follow the money.
[01:03:29.568 --> 01:03:38.852]  Let's talk about the money and how this is happening and why it's happening after this quick three-minute break with Kathy Adams, president of the Texas Eagle Forum.
[01:03:39.252 --> 01:03:39.992]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:40.052 --> 01:03:44.794]  Infowars.com, jonesreport.com, prisonplanet.com are the websites.
[01:03:44.834 --> 01:03:48.495]  Then we'll have open phones, get into the global warming hoax and a lot more.

[01:05:55.788 --> 01:05:58.710]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:05:59.031 --> 01:06:01.592]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:06:01.953 --> 01:06:06.776]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:06:07.156 --> 01:06:12.540]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:15.802]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[01:06:15.982 --> 01:06:17.142]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[01:06:39.389 --> 01:06:44.731]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:44.951]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:06:44.991 --> 01:06:48.132]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:48.152 --> 01:06:49.252]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:10.852 --> 01:07:11.652]  Welcome back.
[01:07:12.333 --> 01:07:15.474]  Now, how this works is, you can go look the numbers up.
[01:07:15.914 --> 01:07:19.516]  Twenty-something years ago, there were only four or five vaccines they tried to claim were mandatory.
[01:07:19.876 --> 01:07:20.956]  It's not even a law.
[01:07:21.937 --> 01:07:23.057]  It's just color of law.
[01:07:23.117 --> 01:07:26.819]  They have waivers through the health department or through your schools by federal and state law.
[01:07:28.393 --> 01:07:32.896]  But now they're aggressively trying to pass laws to make you take vaccines.
[01:07:32.936 --> 01:07:35.757]  And they've done this in several countries around the world.
[01:07:36.158 --> 01:07:37.218]  It's very, very dangerous.
[01:07:37.699 --> 01:07:38.659]  Of course, there's mercury.
[01:07:38.679 --> 01:07:40.740]  There's all sorts of other problems, DNA fragments.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:47.424]  But this new vaccine is a live virus that they've just basically chopped the DNA up and taken it out.
[01:07:48.125 --> 01:07:56.070]  And so your body creates an immunity so that your young girl supposedly won't get cervical cancer.
[01:07:56.810 --> 01:08:06.296]  Which, again, if you just get pap smears, they can deal with it, and it's a very easy cancer of caught early to deal with, and it's extreme promiscuity that normally causes this.
[01:08:07.056 --> 01:08:11.158]  And so why would they want to give it to 7, 8, 9, 10-year-old, 11-year-old girls?
[01:08:11.699 --> 01:08:19.043]  And it's also, again, as you heard, not recommended even by the different medical institutions, but after they're lobbied, I'm sure they will.
[01:08:19.443 --> 01:08:23.205]  Going to Kathy Adams, who's on vacation, joining us from Cozumel, Mexico.
[01:08:23.225 --> 01:08:24.046]  Again, I'm very envious.
[01:08:24.887 --> 01:08:27.109]  She is the president of the Texas Eagle Forum.
[01:08:27.129 --> 01:08:28.590]  You know that, run by Phyllis Schlafly.
[01:08:29.130 --> 01:08:30.992]  And she is on with us today.
[01:08:31.052 --> 01:08:35.797]  She's on the front lines fighting this and was quoted by the Associated Press in an article.
[01:08:36.117 --> 01:08:41.021]  Drug maker wants law to require STD shot girls as young as 11.
[01:08:41.061 --> 01:08:46.206]  And I've seen them talking about giving it to 6-7 year old girls to be immunized against cervical cancer.
[01:08:46.967 --> 01:08:50.110]  Tell us what's really going on here, Mrs. Adams.
[01:08:50.595 --> 01:08:53.477]  Well, there are two things that I really want your listeners to hear.
[01:08:53.657 --> 01:09:10.509]  One is that in Dallas, pardon me, in Austin, Texas, right there in our hub, in our own state, we have already three bills filed in order to require this human papillomavirus education and immunization.
[01:09:11.489 --> 01:09:17.313]  And these bills have already been filed, as I say, House Bill 146, House Bill 215, and Senate Bill 110.
[01:09:20.242 --> 01:09:31.147]  And when you've got the governor pushing it, and I will tell you, I've already gotten a call from the governor's office, and they're already asking me to get on board, and I've already told them that I'm gonna do everything I can to defeat it.
[01:09:31.687 --> 01:09:43.152]  The second thing I want your listeners to hear is that I received a call from a grandmother in Pennsylvania just yesterday, because her granddaughter did receive this vaccine.
[01:09:43.172 --> 01:09:49.675]  21 days later, she acquired an autoimmune dysfunction.
[01:09:50.407 --> 01:09:59.104]  And now the poor little girl was a cheerleader, and now she has bleeding under the skin and an autoimmune disease.
[01:09:59.765 --> 01:10:04.770]  And she cannot participate anymore in the social activities in her own class.
[01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:06.691]  Oh, there's an agenda behind this.
[01:10:06.751 --> 01:10:08.713]  I don't think that's any accident.
[01:10:09.154 --> 01:10:10.535]  Hundreds of new vaccines a year.
[01:10:10.595 --> 01:10:11.956]  They want to force everybody to take them.
[01:10:12.356 --> 01:10:17.481]  Specifically, let's get into the law, because they claim you've got to take all these other vaccines, put them on the mandatory list.
[01:10:17.741 --> 01:10:20.063]  They're trying to even now beef up these laws.
[01:10:20.103 --> 01:10:20.804]  Let's talk about that.
[01:10:21.838 --> 01:10:23.220]  They are trying to beef them up.
[01:10:23.841 --> 01:10:26.824]  And if you don't get these, they want them to be mandated.
[01:10:26.925 --> 01:10:34.254]  And see, if you make a vaccine mandated, then the insurance companies in the state have to provide the money for it.
[01:10:34.714 --> 01:10:36.196]  That's what Merck is after.
[01:10:36.617 --> 01:10:40.041]  They're not after health, because this is only a four-year test.
[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:43.521]  From 16 to 26-year-old women.
[01:10:43.941 --> 01:10:52.023]  No one knows what kind of birth defects that this could cause when that 10-year-old gets that vaccine and has a baby when she's 22.
[01:10:52.683 --> 01:10:56.144]  No one is talking about long-term effects because they don't know.
[01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:59.805]  But we do know that short-term effects are exactly what I just said.
[01:11:00.205 --> 01:11:08.708]  A young girl now with an acquired autoimmune disease and bleeding under the skin and cannot participate even in her school activities.
[01:11:09.784 --> 01:11:12.207]  And let's be specific here about this.
[01:11:12.287 --> 01:11:27.624]  This is a live, cultured virus, and even if you can trust these companies and the government, which you can't with the vaccine eugenics passed in history, of course when you culture up hundreds of millions of viruses or more per batch...
[01:11:28.044 --> 01:11:41.855]  You're going to get malfunctions in this engineered virus and get the full virus, and hence give girls not just this cancer-causing original variant, but other autoimmune disease problems.
[01:11:41.895 --> 01:11:43.917]  Lord knows what this is going to cause.
[01:11:44.497 --> 01:11:45.418]  That's right.
[01:11:45.518 --> 01:11:48.380]  We're giving girls a live virus.
[01:11:48.961 --> 01:11:52.704]  And, you know, if there was a virus that could be cured, why not the cold?
[01:11:53.314 --> 01:12:06.472]  And besides that, they're going now after a virus that they're only in the entire country annually 9,800 new cases, which represents .007% only of all of the cancer cases.
[01:12:06.833 --> 01:12:08.856]  So they're going after something very minor.
[01:12:09.415 --> 01:12:15.120]  In numbers, not that it's not to be dreaded or prevented, but that's the good news.
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:18.962]  It is preventable by just having a pap smear and they cure it themselves.
[01:12:19.303 --> 01:12:24.026]  And the shot costs $360 for the three-shot regimen.
[01:12:24.787 --> 01:12:32.893]  So we're talking about tens of billions in profit a year if they force the tens of millions of young girls and women to take this.
[01:12:33.354 --> 01:12:34.114]  Follow the money.
[01:12:34.534 --> 01:12:39.038]  Every legislator in Texas ought to be listening.
[01:12:39.423 --> 01:12:40.444]  Follow the money.
[01:12:40.844 --> 01:12:46.346]  Because if you're looking at really what is at stake here, this is not a cure.
[01:12:46.727 --> 01:12:47.967]  This could be a cause.
[01:12:48.387 --> 01:12:49.768]  This is going to have a fallout.
[01:12:49.808 --> 01:12:56.231]  The state will be accountable to, if indeed they do mandate this, this is all about money.
[01:12:56.591 --> 01:13:01.374]  The Merck Company is the same company that created Vioxx and is lost in the courts now.
[01:13:01.954 --> 01:13:03.295]  Merck is after the money.
[01:13:03.515 --> 01:13:08.157]  Legislators cannot sacrifice our children, replace parental rights,
[01:13:08.797 --> 01:13:15.227]  In order to put the state in charge instead of that mom and dad who will make a good decision for their daughter.
[01:13:16.218 --> 01:13:23.284]  Well, as you said, a little over 9,000 cases a year with this country having 150 million women.
[01:13:23.304 --> 01:13:25.286]  9,000 cases a year.
[01:13:25.326 --> 01:13:28.069]  This is ridiculous, even if you could trust the vaccine.
[01:13:28.429 --> 01:13:30.911]  And again, it's this new wave of live virus.
[01:13:30.951 --> 01:13:34.795]  This is a cancer virus that has been manipulated.
[01:13:35.796 --> 01:13:39.039]  But the AP is reporting that there is massive resistance to this.
[01:13:39.079 --> 01:13:40.280]  Can you detail that for us?
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.341]  Oh, I am so happy about it.
[01:13:42.441 --> 01:13:54.024]  As a matter of fact, a legislator from Michigan has already fought it off after it passed their Senate like 36 to 1, and then he was able to kill it in their house, but he's coming back.
[01:13:54.565 --> 01:13:58.846]  When there is money behind an idea, it is very, very difficult to stop.
[01:13:58.946 --> 01:14:04.988]  And Merck has got... I mean, why do we have a new Freedom Commission with the mandatory universal mental health screening
[01:14:05.436 --> 01:14:06.637]  In an executive order.
[01:14:06.997 --> 01:14:07.658]  Follow the money.
[01:14:08.018 --> 01:14:10.140]  Who got President Bush elected?
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.721]  I mean, let's look.
[01:14:11.801 --> 01:14:14.884]  It's not just the grassroots who heard him say Jesus in a debate.
[01:14:15.244 --> 01:14:22.890]  We're talking about a man who's taking lots of money from the pharmaceutical company, and they are very public about now it's time for payback.
[01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:30.676]  That's what we don't want our children to be sacrificed at an altar of anybody's political agenda, whether it is giving them psychotropic drugs,
[01:14:31.044 --> 01:14:31.665]  Thank you very much.
[01:14:38.603 --> 01:14:41.245]  Very unlikely that they'll ever be able to prevent.
[01:14:41.345 --> 01:14:45.448]  There is no study out there adequate now to show that this is a healthy move.
[01:14:45.788 --> 01:14:48.730]  This is medical and governmental tyranny.
[01:14:49.071 --> 01:15:02.160]  This is a new form of slavery where financial bodies and medical institutions for profit lobby and take over our state and federal government to foist all of this upon us.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:04.922]  This should have everyone seeing red right now.
[01:15:05.461 --> 01:15:05.981]  That's right.
[01:15:06.421 --> 01:15:09.983]  And I certainly do hope that parents will not give up their parental rights.
[01:15:10.503 --> 01:15:14.644]  And the governor's office is saying, well, if we have an opt-out... No, no, no, no.
[01:15:14.964 --> 01:15:16.085]  We need an opt-in.
[01:15:16.485 --> 01:15:20.926]  If a mom and dad want that virus for their daughter, then that's their decision with their doctor.
[01:15:21.326 --> 01:15:26.708]  It is not the state's business to mandate this and then require insurance companies to have to recover it.
[01:15:27.349 --> 01:15:32.310]  And one other thing we haven't touched on is the fact that these vaccines have lots of aluminum in them.
[01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:34.211]  Aluminum is also...
[01:15:34.873 --> 01:15:36.855]  As we know, related to Alzheimer's.
[01:15:36.895 --> 01:15:37.675]  No, absolutely.
[01:15:38.076 --> 01:15:39.757]  The plaques form in the brain.
[01:15:40.197 --> 01:15:40.498]  Yes.
[01:15:40.758 --> 01:15:43.760]  And so we don't want to be injecting young children with this.
[01:15:44.141 --> 01:15:49.265]  And then when they're 50, 60 years old, we start seeing the results of these kinds of vaccines.
[01:15:49.445 --> 01:15:52.888]  Kathy Adams, they've clearly, I don't want to get your take on this, gone too far.
[01:15:53.368 --> 01:15:57.912]  Because, you know, 25, 35, now 45 vaccines they're trying to claim you've got to take.
[01:15:58.232 --> 01:15:59.813]  More and more being added each year.
[01:16:00.113 --> 01:16:08.198]  By pushing this so far in live cancer viruses, you already see masses of people refusing to vaccinate, period.
[01:16:08.338 --> 01:16:11.420]  I think this is going to accelerate people resisting.
[01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:19.605]  So maybe this type of hubris and wanton abandon by these corrupt institutions and companies is going to actually force the debate to widen.
[01:16:20.265 --> 01:16:20.906]  I hope so.
[01:16:21.006 --> 01:16:24.248]  And I do know a lot of parents who are not vaccinating their children.
[01:16:24.308 --> 01:16:27.670]  And I thank God that my three grandchildren have not been vaccinated.
[01:16:28.123 --> 01:16:33.570]  But those parents, my son and daughter-in-law, are looking and listening to the doctor's advice.
[01:16:34.111 --> 01:16:35.192]  They are praying about it.
[01:16:35.372 --> 01:16:36.494]  They are thinking it through.
[01:16:36.554 --> 01:16:38.396]  They are looking at the pros and the cons.
[01:16:38.777 --> 01:16:40.218]  And they're making that decision.
[01:16:40.599 --> 01:16:42.260]  That's where this needs to stay.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.422]  And even the Medical Association is against it.
[01:16:45.583 --> 01:16:46.203]  Final question.
[01:16:46.223 --> 01:16:52.228]  You talked about this lady, the grandmother in Pennsylvania, and I've already got reports here about the autoimmune problems.
[01:16:52.248 --> 01:16:54.670]  The experimental shots they're giving the troops are doing the same things.
[01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:55.671]  A lot of them are dying.
[01:16:56.352 --> 01:17:01.536]  I'd like to, when you get back, maybe get in touch, or if you have her number, get in touch with that grandmother.
[01:17:01.596 --> 01:17:05.179]  I'd like people to hear firsthand what this can do to our girls.
[01:17:05.259 --> 01:17:05.519]  Absolutely.
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:08.661]  I do have her number, and I have her father's number as well.
[01:17:09.121 --> 01:17:13.322]  Well, I've got a daughter, and I said earlier before you got on, over my dead body.
[01:17:13.642 --> 01:17:16.563]  Hell will freeze over before they give this to my little girl.
[01:17:16.883 --> 01:17:18.543]  Well, stick next to your daughter.
[01:17:19.023 --> 01:17:25.165]  You're the one who's been given that responsibility and that right, not only constitutionally, but it is a God-given right.
[01:17:25.625 --> 01:17:28.446]  And I thank you for standing next to your daughter and protecting her.
[01:17:29.887 --> 01:17:31.787]  Well, I thank you for what you're doing.
[01:17:31.867 --> 01:17:36.088]  Any websites or any other information you think that people should know about in the last minute we've got?
[01:17:36.789 --> 01:17:37.069]  Sure.
[01:17:37.309 --> 01:17:39.809]  Our website is TexasEagle.org.
[01:17:39.849 --> 01:17:43.110]  It's spelled out T-E-X-A-S-E-A-G-L-E.org.
[01:17:43.650 --> 01:17:47.031]  And we welcome you to look there at some other issues that we're dealing in.
[01:17:47.391 --> 01:17:51.432]  I also am the Global Governance Chairman for the National Eagle Forum and have traveled to
[01:17:52.173 --> 01:17:55.357]  Kathy Adams, it's clear I need to get you on for a full hour when you return.
[01:17:55.437 --> 01:17:56.378]  When are you getting back?
[01:17:56.739 --> 01:17:57.379]  On next Friday.
[01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:12.492]  Okay, well, we'll talk to you in a week and a half or so.
[01:18:12.552 --> 01:18:14.253]  I'd like to put you on hold now.
[01:18:14.293 --> 01:18:18.275]  If you have that lady's name and number, I'd like to contact her and get her on next week.
[01:18:18.335 --> 01:18:18.916]  Is that okay?
[01:18:19.576 --> 01:18:22.638]  Yes, but I have that actually at home, and I don't have it with me.
[01:18:22.818 --> 01:18:23.359]  That's okay.
[01:18:23.379 --> 01:18:35.726]  We'll just mark a note down, and then perhaps we'll get you and her on next week or two weeks from now and do 30 minutes on the vaccines and then 30 minutes on some of the global governance meetings you've been to.
[01:18:36.207 --> 01:18:36.527]  Perfect.
[01:18:37.176 --> 01:18:38.277]  Thank you, Kathy Adams.
[01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:38.677]  Thank you.
[01:18:38.737 --> 01:18:39.617]  Have a good week.
[01:18:39.797 --> 01:18:40.878]  Have a great vacation.
[01:18:41.618 --> 01:18:48.901]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break with your calls, tons of news, and later, a special treat.
[01:18:51.676 --> 01:18:52.437]  Terrorism.
[01:18:52.597 --> 01:18:53.337]  Terrorism.
[01:18:53.437 --> 01:18:54.278]  Chemical attacks.
[01:18:54.358 --> 01:18:55.018]  Dirty bombs.
[01:18:55.118 --> 01:18:55.539]  Fallout.
[01:18:55.599 --> 01:18:56.599]  Biological attack.
[01:18:56.779 --> 01:18:57.320]  Anthrax.
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.501]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:18:59.761 --> 01:19:01.363]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:19:01.603 --> 01:19:04.084]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:19:04.465 --> 01:19:19.034]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:19:19.074 --> 01:19:19.375]  government.
[01:19:19.575 --> 01:19:21.376]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:19:21.736 --> 01:19:27.658]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:19:27.778 --> 01:19:32.280]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:39.262]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:19:39.322 --> 01:19:41.963]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:19:51.010 --> 01:19:52.031]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[01:19:52.092 --> 01:19:52.833]  February 2nd, 2007.
[01:19:53.033 --> 01:19:53.373]  Gold 655.
[01:19:53.413 --> 01:19:55.817]  Ounce gold coins are 676.36, 340.73 per half, 170.37 for quarter ounce.
[01:19:55.837 --> 01:19:56.217]  That's 676.36, 340.73, and 170.37.
[01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:07.891]  1971, Nixon closes the gold window.
[01:20:07.951 --> 01:20:08.831]  Fiat currency.
[01:20:09.592 --> 01:20:13.454]  1920s, the German mark explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[01:20:13.774 --> 01:20:15.655]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[01:20:16.375 --> 01:20:19.577]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[01:20:19.597 --> 01:20:23.099]  1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[01:20:23.299 --> 01:20:26.040]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:31.483]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[01:20:31.643 --> 01:20:32.924]  Could government let this happen?
[01:20:33.064 --> 01:20:35.045]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[01:20:35.305 --> 01:20:42.390]  Midas has Nick Bereshev's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat-tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:44.171]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[01:20:44.231 --> 01:20:45.172]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[01:20:45.192 --> 01:20:45.432]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:45.452 --> 01:20:46.473]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:54.813 --> 01:21:01.480]  Did you know that one goal of international communism was to get our young people's mind off religion by getting on to sex?
[01:21:02.341 --> 01:21:12.112]  By destroying the morals of the younger generation, America would eventually become ripe for revolution without understanding why communism wanted to make young people soft and easily controlled.
[01:21:13.237 --> 01:21:14.198]  Five, one, six, eight, seven, three, six.
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:41.985]  That's 1-800-516-8736 to request your subscription.
[01:21:42.645 --> 01:21:43.246]  Call now.
[01:21:43.426 --> 01:21:46.087]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:21:49.221 --> 01:21:53.204]  I found this company online, and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[01:21:53.424 --> 01:21:56.986]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:21:57.247 --> 01:22:01.329]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:02.550]  I was so amazed.
[01:22:02.791 --> 01:22:05.632]  I put it in the baby's room, and it made a perfect nightlight.
[01:22:05.833 --> 01:22:07.694]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:22:08.094 --> 01:22:13.278]  Soleilwellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[01:22:13.758 --> 01:22:19.662]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[01:22:19.942 --> 01:22:21.663]  I figured it would clean really well.
[01:22:21.923 --> 01:22:25.105]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[01:22:25.285 --> 01:22:29.188]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[01:22:29.468 --> 01:22:30.909]  Plus, the service was great.
[01:22:31.249 --> 01:22:36.393]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit SolayWellness.com.
[01:22:36.433 --> 01:22:39.575]  That's S-O-L-A-Y Wellness.com.
[01:22:39.755 --> 01:22:40.216]  Or call 312-224-2710.
[01:22:40.236 --> 01:22:40.276]  312-224-2710.
[01:22:56.207 --> 01:22:58.107]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:22:58.587 --> 01:23:01.428]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:04.228 --> 01:23:11.010]  All right, let's go back to your calls, and I'm going to get into a little info section on global warming, try to put all the pieces together.
[01:23:12.610 --> 01:23:14.410]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:14.990]  Who's up next?
[01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:16.210]  Is it CH in Florida?
[01:23:17.071 --> 01:23:18.511]  CH in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:23:18.551 --> 01:23:19.011]  Go ahead.
[01:23:21.471 --> 01:23:23.652]  And he is listening to his radio.
[01:23:23.672 --> 01:23:23.712]  CH.
[01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:28.067]  Okay, we'll move on.
[01:23:28.527 --> 01:23:30.308]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:23:30.328 --> 01:23:30.788]  Go ahead.
[01:23:33.809 --> 01:23:35.249]  This happens when I keep calling.
[01:23:35.529 --> 01:23:36.169]  Alex, are you there?
[01:23:36.269 --> 01:23:37.409]  Yeah, go ahead, sir.
[01:23:37.489 --> 01:23:38.049]  I'm sorry about that.
[01:23:38.209 --> 01:23:38.790]  It doesn't matter.
[01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:41.810]  I know it's next Sunday, but I want to be the first to wish you a happy birthday this month.
[01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:43.150]  Well, thank you.
[01:23:43.271 --> 01:23:43.951]  You're quite welcome.
[01:23:44.811 --> 01:23:45.891]  I bless the day that you were born.
[01:23:46.351 --> 01:23:47.491]  Oh, come on.
[01:23:47.511 --> 01:23:53.333]  I wanted to share with all the listeners a little conversation I had today with the terrorists over at the IRS.
[01:23:54.073 --> 01:23:54.753]  I received a...
[01:23:55.839 --> 01:24:01.280]  A little flyer in my gas bill that had information about earned income tax credits.
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:05.141]  And it had an 800 number there that said you can call the IRS.
[01:24:05.241 --> 01:24:07.281]  It's 1-800-829-1040.
[01:24:09.102 --> 01:24:17.183]  And I cross-referenced that number to the telephone book, which is also the toll-free number listed in most phone books for the IRS.
[01:24:17.783 --> 01:24:19.744]  Yet the person I spoke to
[01:24:21.405 --> 01:24:27.028]  Which, it took me three different people to get to the Advanced Tax Law Department.
[01:24:27.988 --> 01:24:32.811]  And I was asking them questions about the definitions of income, person, taxpayer, shall, and must.
[01:24:33.571 --> 01:24:35.352]  I asked if there was a direct or indirect tax.
[01:24:35.892 --> 01:24:38.934]  I asked him what statute makes me liable and what form is required.
[01:24:39.314 --> 01:24:40.555]  He took all the information down.
[01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:42.576]  He kept me on hold for like 20 minutes.
[01:24:43.076 --> 01:24:50.820]  And then he came back and he stated that I would go and have to contact a tax professional to answer all of my questions if they weren't
[01:24:52.345 --> 01:24:53.946]  They didn't have the ability to do so.
[01:24:54.426 --> 01:24:59.890]  And to boil it down, you can call up the IRS and ask where the law is and how it works and where it's paid, and they won't tell you.
[01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:01.091]  It was just incredible.
[01:25:02.011 --> 01:25:02.772]  It was incredible.
[01:25:02.792 --> 01:25:05.454]  And I would encourage everybody to do that just to tie up their phone lines.
[01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:11.291]  And ask those questions.
[01:25:11.311 --> 01:25:12.132]  You're absolutely right.
[01:25:12.852 --> 01:25:17.575]  They will not answer those questions because they know that they're going to be caught.
[01:25:17.595 --> 01:25:20.557]  Now, once again, there's a term that you use in a lot of your films.
[01:25:20.837 --> 01:25:29.362]  They're either willfully ignorant or they're flat out fabricating the truth, which in all of our cases is unacceptable.
[01:25:30.359 --> 01:25:31.160]  It is, my friend.
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:32.241]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:32.301 --> 01:25:33.582]  And it doesn't go to run the country.
[01:25:33.602 --> 01:25:34.843]  It goes right to the private banks.
[01:25:35.403 --> 01:25:36.804]  Let's talk to Mike in Texas.
[01:25:36.844 --> 01:25:37.645]  Mike, thanks for holding.
[01:25:37.685 --> 01:25:38.265]  You're on the air.
[01:25:38.506 --> 01:25:39.647]  Hey there, Alex.
[01:25:39.927 --> 01:25:40.587]  Happy birthday to you.
[01:25:40.627 --> 01:25:41.468]  I didn't know it was this weekend.
[01:25:41.688 --> 01:25:42.829]  Oh, please, please.
[01:25:43.129 --> 01:25:43.770]  No, it's not.
[01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:47.313]  It's later this month, but thank you for all the kind words.
[01:25:47.553 --> 01:25:48.133]  Oh, you're very welcome.
[01:25:48.153 --> 01:25:49.755]  This is the second time I called in.
[01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:51.516]  I was looking through Google Video.
[01:25:51.556 --> 01:25:54.418]  I go through every now and then and look at all the new 9-11 truth stuff.
[01:25:55.965 --> 01:26:02.451]  One of the things I ran across was a video put out by this guy named Mark Aradian called Screw Loose Change.
[01:26:02.952 --> 01:26:04.953]  And I went through and I kind of just looked at this guy.
[01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.155]  He subtitled everything.
[01:26:06.755 --> 01:26:14.903]  And I started writing him an email that was probably a good 14 pages long just describing how much of an idiot he is going through every comment that he made.
[01:26:14.923 --> 01:26:19.567]  I was just wondering if you happen to see that yet or if you happen to deal with that guy yet.
[01:26:20.419 --> 01:26:27.050]  Yes, I've seen it, and I've seen him prancing around at ground zero, and he is a real piece of work, let me tell you, and it's...
[01:26:28.425 --> 01:26:31.127]  Most of what he says is disinfo or straw man.
[01:26:31.227 --> 01:26:34.109]  Some of what he says is true, because there are mistakes out there.
[01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:41.714]  Nobody's perfect, and the 9-11 Truth Movement just knows that we've been lied to, and the official story is the most ridiculous conspiracy theory of them all.
[01:26:42.154 --> 01:26:42.714]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:43.435 --> 01:26:47.117]  When I watched that video, I was amazed at how much disinfo he put in there.
[01:26:47.137 --> 01:26:50.279]  There were some things that I saw that I was like, okay, well, you know, those guys weren't correct.
[01:26:50.299 --> 01:26:51.800]  That's why they're doing yet another edition.
[01:26:53.014 --> 01:26:58.859]  Well, I mean, the first one had a few mistakes, and the next one had less, and I mean, no one's perfect.
[01:26:59.379 --> 01:27:08.606]  Every time I put a film out, and like a year later, when millions of people have watched it online and thousands on DVD, I find two or three things that are wrong, and then I put out a second edition.
[01:27:08.666 --> 01:27:10.928]  Generally, sometimes people don't even know I put out a second edition.
[01:27:10.968 --> 01:27:14.670]  They just, you know, the mistakes are corrected and it's put back out.
[01:27:14.710 --> 01:27:16.412]  We never claim to be infallible.
[01:27:16.432 --> 01:27:22.116]  Exactly, but that thing, I just, you know, I wanted to see if you can get a comment on there, because
[01:27:22.458 --> 01:27:45.070]  You know, people that will watch that, you know, a lot of people that are easily duped, they're going to go through and go, oh, okay, well, you know, I believe... Yeah, but there's been analysis that's been done of that, and really the best thing I can do is just ignore it and continue to put the facts out instead of sending, you know, people to view it, because it's really, we need to just, you know, they're trying to start World War III, they lied us into war, there's all these declassified examples.
[01:27:45.370 --> 01:27:51.554]  Like, notice, you don't see a bunch of debunking a terror storm because the thing had really one mistake in it,
[01:27:52.214 --> 01:27:55.857]  And it's a very small mistake, and it doesn't even matter.
[01:27:56.098 --> 01:27:58.700]  The point is, it's admitted government-sponsored terror.
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:04.224]  It's admitted openly, and so they don't ever want to debate that stuff.
[01:28:04.264 --> 01:28:06.046]  I appreciate your call, Mike.
[01:28:06.846 --> 01:28:09.829]  They don't want to talk about all the admissions of terror.
[01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:12.619]  They don't want to talk about CIA insider trading.
[01:28:12.639 --> 01:28:13.720]  They don't want to talk about Building 7.
[01:28:14.421 --> 01:28:16.382]  They don't want to talk about the hundreds and hundreds of points.
[01:28:16.762 --> 01:28:19.024]  And you've got millions of people involved in 9-11 Truth.
[01:28:19.084 --> 01:28:20.405]  Of course there's going to be screwballs.
[01:28:20.985 --> 01:28:22.446]  Of course there's going to be people making mistakes.
[01:28:22.847 --> 01:28:25.409]  The point is we know we've been lied to on the official story.
[01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:27.010]  We're trying to get at the truth.
[01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:29.271]  We're all running different investigations here.
[01:28:29.531 --> 01:28:31.633]  And we've gotten a pretty darn clear picture of what happened.
[01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:33.234]  It was an inside job.
[01:28:33.254 --> 01:28:36.777]  84% of Americans in the scientific poll believe they've been lied to.
[01:28:36.797 --> 01:28:39.118]  36% believe total inside job.
[01:28:39.438 --> 01:28:39.919]  We're winning.
[01:28:41.869 --> 01:28:42.772]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.274 --> 01:28:44.879]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.802 --> 01:28:48.490]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:51.522 --> 01:28:56.284]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[01:28:56.525 --> 01:29:00.507]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[01:29:00.767 --> 01:29:07.070]  As you may have heard by now, Ken Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:11.692]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.
[01:29:11.872 --> 01:29:17.155]  For a lot less than you'd expect, this portable system can chop up nearly a third of your electric bill.

[01:29:51.621 --> 01:29:52.201]  Hi, Michelle.
[01:29:52.241 --> 01:29:53.581]  I haven't seen you on the bus for a while.
[01:29:53.882 --> 01:29:54.902]  Did they change your shift?
[01:29:55.082 --> 01:29:55.602]  No, Lori.
[01:29:55.862 --> 01:29:57.102]  I finally quit my job.
[01:29:57.382 --> 01:29:59.543]  I'm working at home now, and I love it.
[01:29:59.943 --> 01:30:00.843]  No more commuting.
[01:30:01.323 --> 01:30:03.524]  And I'm home when the kids get out of school.
[01:30:03.684 --> 01:30:04.564]  Working at home?
[01:30:04.964 --> 01:30:05.564]  Doing what?
[01:30:05.864 --> 01:30:06.804]  It's a long story.
[01:30:07.105 --> 01:30:10.205]  It all started when I discovered the website EarnMoneyAtHome123.com.
[01:30:10.465 --> 01:30:15.506]  Oh, Michelle, you didn't fall for one of those Internet deals, did you?
[01:30:15.747 --> 01:30:17.727]  Well, I looked into several, and this one...
[01:30:18.007 --> 01:30:18.707]  It's for real.
[01:30:19.008 --> 01:30:19.948]  Are you sure?
[01:30:20.128 --> 01:30:25.231]  I didn't quit my job until I was sure, and now I'm making way more money working at home.
[01:30:25.452 --> 01:30:25.812]  Really?
[01:30:26.012 --> 01:30:29.554]  I've joined the Success Team and their major advertising co-op.
[01:30:29.814 --> 01:30:34.277]  Our business is fully automated, which gives me more money and the time to enjoy it.
[01:30:34.557 --> 01:30:36.638]  I'll be earning money while we're skiing this winter.
[01:30:36.778 --> 01:30:37.939]  What was that website again?
[01:30:38.119 --> 01:30:40.761]  EarnMoneyAtHome123.com.
[01:30:40.841 --> 01:30:41.841]  Here, write it down.
[01:30:41.922 --> 01:30:42.422]  Good idea!
[01:30:42.882 --> 01:30:45.083]  EarnMoneyAtHome123.com.
[01:30:45.363 --> 01:30:47.104]  Maybe we can go skiing this winter, too.
[01:30:47.364 --> 01:30:50.325]  EarnMoneyAtHome123.com is a global opportunity.
[01:30:51.106 --> 01:30:52.587]  What is the secret of the sea?
[01:30:52.927 --> 01:30:58.569]  It's the exciting food from the sea, and it can be yours with nature's original superfood from Wachter's.
[01:30:58.789 --> 01:31:05.432]  This excellent, exclusive blend of Wachter's sea vegetation is bursting with over 65 trace minerals and vitamins.
[01:31:05.633 --> 01:31:10.835]  Our sea vegetation contains 40 times more nutrients than any land-grown vegetation.
[01:31:11.035 --> 01:31:11.375]  We're good to go.
[01:31:30.521 --> 01:31:33.524]  Call Wachters today to order your bottle of sea vegetation.
[01:31:33.664 --> 01:31:36.286]  Join us on a business associate call to learn more at 800-682-7100.
[01:31:36.326 --> 01:31:36.547]  That's 800-682-7100.
[01:31:36.567 --> 01:31:38.128]  Or visit our website at Wachters.com.
[01:31:38.148 --> 01:31:39.029]  That's W-A-C-H-T-E-R-S dot com.
[01:31:56.385 --> 01:32:02.087]  We'll have some time to take calls and cover news in the third hour, but I'm going to air 28 minutes of my question and answer.
[01:32:03.447 --> 01:32:15.131]  Now, we had a camera on the stage in the lectern there at the UT Union Ballroom where upwards of 1,000 people showed up last night.
[01:32:15.171 --> 01:32:16.491]  Well, 900 seats.
[01:32:16.511 --> 01:32:17.932]  They turned away over 100 people.
[01:32:17.992 --> 01:32:21.233]  It was just a huge, overwhelming success for 9-11 Truth.
[01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:24.842]  But I think the questions and answers were really interesting.
[01:32:24.882 --> 01:32:29.164]  And so we're going to play, not all of it, because there's about 40 minutes of it.
[01:32:29.184 --> 01:32:30.545]  We're going to play about 28 minutes of it.
[01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:38.651]  And so that will give us about another 12 minutes or so of time to cover news and take a few calls in the next hour.
[01:32:38.671 --> 01:32:40.452]  Continue with your phone calls right now.
[01:32:40.472 --> 01:32:44.775]  I also want to spend about five minutes on some of the new developments with the global warming hype.
[01:32:45.175 --> 01:32:49.438]  But before we do that, you know I've made 15 films.
[01:32:52.964 --> 01:32:55.085]  Documentary I produced is Terror Storm.
[01:32:56.165 --> 01:33:00.067]  And it really is a powerful documentary.
[01:33:00.127 --> 01:33:02.148]  It covers the history of government sponsored terror.
[01:33:02.188 --> 01:33:06.309]  Then we look at 9-11, 7-7, all the latest developments.
[01:33:07.149 --> 01:33:13.412]  Then we get into the torture, the secret arrests, the fake news, the propaganda, what the NSA is doing.
[01:33:13.832 --> 01:33:18.434]  We look at propaganda and how they admit that they're creating a world government.
[01:33:18.734 --> 01:33:21.475]  How they admit they're brainwashing the public from their own documents.
[01:33:23.198 --> 01:33:28.645]  We go out to Crawford and show you the idiot pro-war people who are just unbelievably off their rockers.
[01:33:29.165 --> 01:33:30.427]  It is an amazing film.
[01:33:30.487 --> 01:33:33.470]  It's also very entertaining to watch.
[01:33:33.490 --> 01:33:35.813]  I don't even want to say entertaining.
[01:33:35.893 --> 01:33:36.874]  It's engaging.
[01:33:37.475 --> 01:33:38.616]  Extremely engaging.
[01:33:39.157 --> 01:33:43.122]  And a lot of big film critics, without me even requesting a review, have said it's the best out there.
[01:33:43.966 --> 01:33:46.388]  And it's gone as high as number 8 on Amazon.com.
[01:33:46.408 --> 01:33:52.653]  You can get it on Amazon.com or you can get it at Infowars.com because only Terror Storm is available on Amazon.com.
[01:33:52.933 --> 01:33:55.695]  My other 14 films are available at Infowars.com.
[01:33:56.035 --> 01:33:59.078]  You can get America, Freedom to Fascism at Infowars.com.
[01:33:59.478 --> 01:34:01.179]  And when you get it, you can get Terror Storm for $9.95.
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:07.805]  When you get America, Freedom to Fascism for $19.95, you can get Terror Storm half price, 50% off, $9.95.
[01:34:07.885 --> 01:34:08.045]  So for $29.95.
[01:34:12.097 --> 01:34:13.817]  95.
[01:34:12.217 --> 01:34:13.817]  You can get both of these films.
[01:34:14.118 --> 01:34:20.799]  Terror Storm also has 68 minutes of extras from the famous and historical 9-11 neocontagionist symposium.
[01:34:20.819 --> 01:34:25.920]  The highlights of that out in Los Angeles, California.
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:33.521]  So again, I hope that everyone out there who hasn't gotten the films, get them as tools.
[01:34:33.581 --> 01:34:36.742]  Even if you know all about New World Order and 9-11, get them.
[01:34:37.162 --> 01:34:38.322]  Give them to other people.
[01:34:39.074 --> 01:34:41.456]  Also, my first seven films were never on DVD.
[01:34:41.476 --> 01:34:42.837]  I never had time to get them on DVD.
[01:34:43.077 --> 01:34:46.359]  To have the menus made and then code it and make it and mass produce them.
[01:34:46.779 --> 01:34:48.140]  We finally got that done.
[01:34:49.221 --> 01:34:56.085]  The fellows down at Brave New Books, Mr. Connor and, of course, Mr. Freeman, they put it together.
[01:34:56.145 --> 01:34:57.326]  They did it because I was so busy.
[01:34:57.726 --> 01:34:59.828]  I now have those professionally mass produced.
[01:35:00.268 --> 01:35:06.592]  And I have my first three Police State films in one case, three different DVDs, Police State
[01:35:07.808 --> 01:35:10.769]  2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:35:11.170 --> 01:35:12.910]  Now available $34.95.
[01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:16.132]  That is 45% off if you bought them individually.
[01:35:16.752 --> 01:35:18.693]  The only way you can get them on DVD is in the box set.
[01:35:19.033 --> 01:35:20.774]  You can also get them individually in VHS.
[01:35:21.354 --> 01:35:23.174]  Someday we'll have them individually on DVD.
[01:35:23.194 --> 01:35:26.456]  It's just we're so busy, don't have the capital to make them.
[01:35:27.516 --> 01:35:28.837]  We're just busy making the new films.
[01:35:30.177 --> 01:35:31.778]  Matrix of Evil now on DVD.
[01:35:31.818 --> 01:35:33.439]  Amazing film with Ron Paul and others.
[01:35:34.139 --> 01:35:36.180]  My first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:36.820]  Excellent.
[01:35:37.333 --> 01:35:40.756]  About the biometric slave grid, the UN taking over the parks, Oklahoma City.
[01:35:42.418 --> 01:35:45.801]  Comprehensive annual financial reports exposed about the secret accounts in government.
[01:35:46.281 --> 01:35:46.942]  Very important.
[01:35:48.061 --> 01:35:48.942]  I think we're good to go.
[01:35:48.962 --> 01:35:50.263]  I think we're good to go.
[01:36:09.426 --> 01:36:16.491]  I mean, we just slashed everything down to the lowest possible price so we can fund our operation but still get you more materials.
[01:36:17.072 --> 01:36:19.293]  So because stuff is less expensive, just buy more.
[01:36:19.453 --> 01:36:19.934]  Get more.
[01:36:20.334 --> 01:36:21.054]  This is a fight.
[01:36:21.174 --> 01:36:23.476]  And you make what we're doing here possible.
[01:36:23.496 --> 01:36:28.460]  And because of your support, we're able to do so much more and get more people on the team and expand our operations.
[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:30.401]  Here is the toll-free number again.
[01:36:30.401 --> 01:36:34.845]  888-253-3139, or you can write to me, I'm Alex Jones, at 3001-3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:36:34.905 --> 01:36:35.165]  All right.
[01:36:51.835 --> 01:36:53.396]  Oh, and don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:53.416 --> 01:37:01.640]  You get a monthly membership, $5.95, all 15 of my films, hundreds of weekly TV reports, special reports, exclusive Aaron Ruscio interview we just did, hour and a half.
[01:37:02.061 --> 01:37:02.801]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:37:02.821 --> 01:37:04.302]  We're doing three, four reports a week now.
[01:37:04.322 --> 01:37:05.222]  It just gets better and better.
[01:37:05.663 --> 01:37:08.104]  I've got three people working on PrisonPlanet.tv full-time.
[01:37:08.824 --> 01:37:10.385]  And it just gets better and better.
[01:37:10.425 --> 01:37:13.747]  Three-year anniversary coming up in April that we've had PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:13.768 --> 01:37:17.130]  We just doubled the bandwidth because that Aaron Russo interview went so crazy.
[01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:18.371]  It slowed down for a day.
[01:37:18.411 --> 01:37:24.575]  We doubled the bandwidth, doubled the cost, and I'm putting into it so we keep it as good as we can for you.
[01:37:24.955 --> 01:37:25.995]  Great activist tool.
[01:37:26.016 --> 01:37:37.283]  You can go there and download all 15 of my films, my weekly TV reports, whatever you think is the most important, and burn them to disk in super high quality down to dial-up quality, whatever you like to burn onto your CDs or DVDs.
[01:37:37.683 --> 01:37:39.124]  Just an amazing activist tool.
[01:37:39.324 --> 01:37:42.366]  And please make copies of all my films when you get them and distribute them.
[01:37:42.386 --> 01:37:43.947]  That's how we're having the biggest effect.
[01:37:44.027 --> 01:37:45.327]  Please air them on AXS TV.
[01:37:45.587 --> 01:37:48.229]  And for all those that have done that, I want to thank you and commend you.
[01:37:48.489 --> 01:37:49.790]  It's really having a huge effect.
[01:37:52.031 --> 01:37:57.374]  In fact, getting back to the UT ballroom last night and 900 people turning away.
[01:37:57.394 --> 01:37:58.735]  I talked to the staff there.
[01:37:58.755 --> 01:38:00.015]  They said they turned away at least 100.
[01:38:00.075 --> 01:38:00.776]  I don't like that.
[01:38:01.536 --> 01:38:05.979]  But with four days promotion, just on this show, and with Infowars.com,
[01:38:08.607 --> 01:38:09.887]  Well, I started promoting it on Monday.
[01:38:09.947 --> 01:38:11.388]  Others, I guess, were promoting it for a few weeks.
[01:38:11.808 --> 01:38:16.091]  To have that many people there on a Thursday night.
[01:38:16.651 --> 01:38:23.675]  And George Shumpert, former city council member, documentary filmmaker, author, good friend of mine, he got up and pointed out, I think he was wrong in a way.
[01:38:23.715 --> 01:38:26.877]  He said, you know, five years ago there'd be 50 people here.
[01:38:28.137 --> 01:38:30.118]  Well, five years ago there'd been 200, 300 people there.
[01:38:30.138 --> 01:38:30.198]  But...
[01:38:35.524 --> 01:38:42.647]  Now, yeah, I mean, it's a thousand people trying to get in and really almost no promotion.
[01:38:43.147 --> 01:38:47.049]  I mean, if the statesman had a big conference there, which they have, you might have 200 people.
[01:38:47.529 --> 01:38:52.292]  When some big neocons comes in with months of promotion, there might be 200 people.
[01:38:53.612 --> 01:38:56.313]  And it's because the population is sick of them.
[01:38:57.594 --> 01:38:58.995]  And the people know what's happening.
[01:39:00.215 --> 01:39:01.496]  And they're aware of what's happening.
[01:39:02.776 --> 01:39:04.197]  And it was despicable...
[01:39:05.231 --> 01:39:08.593]  But I actually wanted them to get in, but they didn't heckle for some reason.
[01:39:10.193 --> 01:39:18.377]  And that was because, I don't know, like 20 anarchists showed up in their black masks and stuff, and they had neocons trying to hand out tenfold hats to everybody that was coming in.
[01:39:18.417 --> 01:39:19.378]  Everybody just ignored them.
[01:39:20.918 --> 01:39:29.062]  They were trying to get disruptive, and some type of squabble broke out, and the head of security was going, listen, we're not going to let them in.
[01:39:29.643 --> 01:39:31.203]  And I said, no, please let them in.
[01:39:31.243 --> 01:39:32.684]  But by the time they showed up late...
[01:39:33.365 --> 01:39:34.467]  We had to start 20 minutes late.
[01:39:34.507 --> 01:39:35.709]  Some people were having trouble getting in.
[01:39:35.729 --> 01:39:41.660]  It was already shut, so the 20 anarchists got shut out with the rest of the people.
[01:39:42.703 --> 01:39:44.624]  Because they got there late.
[01:39:45.524 --> 01:39:47.525]  And I was kind of let down last night.
[01:39:47.905 --> 01:39:50.247]  When they attacked me, I was going to have a debate with them.
[01:39:50.307 --> 01:39:51.987]  I was going to be entertaining and informative.
[01:39:52.247 --> 01:39:58.310]  I had a big list of things about how the anarchists were funded by Big Ford Foundation and others, how they were bust into sabotage.
[01:39:58.330 --> 01:40:10.776]  And I don't mean all the anarchists, but this particular sub-derivation, this particular strain, this particular group of folks, are just incredible.
[01:40:11.596 --> 01:40:13.642]  And they go around trying to destabilize everything.
[01:40:13.682 --> 01:40:16.691]  And in Seattle, they were hired by the police, brought in by the government publicly.
[01:40:16.711 --> 01:40:17.112]  I have it all.
[01:40:17.132 --> 01:40:18.216]  The police state do the takeover.
[01:40:19.153 --> 01:40:21.254]  And that's just 30 minutes of the two-hour film.
[01:40:21.974 --> 01:40:30.038]  And they were there to cause a problem and attack the police and burn things down and knock out windows to then have them pull back after a day.
[01:40:30.558 --> 01:40:32.459]  And the news media going, why don't the police do anything?
[01:40:32.479 --> 01:40:35.200]  And the police attack 60-plus thousand peaceful demonstrators.
[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:36.721]  So I was all ready for them.
[01:40:37.321 --> 01:40:38.882]  See, I like people who disagree with me.
[01:40:38.962 --> 01:40:43.644]  And I like people who illustrate how ignorant they are.
[01:40:44.785 --> 01:40:45.705]  I really enjoy it.
[01:40:46.653 --> 01:41:05.727]  And so it was kind of a letdown that they were so busy basically harassing everybody that was coming in and yelling all of their mindless slogans like drunken parrots that by the time they tried to get in, like 80 other poor folks, they were unable to.
[01:41:05.747 --> 01:41:10.090]  And where else would you see it?
[01:41:10.757 --> 01:41:11.457]  We're good to go.
[01:41:11.477 --> 01:41:12.298]  We're good to go.
[01:41:36.730 --> 01:41:41.293]  They always claim they're anarchists, but they're all wearing communist shirts and red stars and then saying they're anarchists.
[01:41:41.833 --> 01:41:43.014]  That's the opposite, twits.
[01:41:43.634 --> 01:41:46.836]  And they're all prancing around, and people were just laughing at them.
[01:41:49.157 --> 01:41:53.440]  I mean, you literally converted no one with your stupidity.
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:55.401]  All right, I'm already digressing.
[01:41:56.761 --> 01:42:04.786]  But, yeah, I mean, it's just so wonderful to see our society waking up.
[01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:10.963]  But it's important for you that are out there that are waking up to not follow Alex Jones or somebody else, that you be leaders.
[01:42:10.983 --> 01:42:14.925]  You start a local newspaper, a local newsletter, a print paper, a website.
[01:42:15.245 --> 01:42:16.546]  Go get a local radio show.
[01:42:16.606 --> 01:42:17.166]  Just try.
[01:42:17.186 --> 01:42:18.107]  It's not as hard as you think.
[01:42:18.127 --> 01:42:19.308]  Get an Axis TV show.
[01:42:19.688 --> 01:42:20.928]  There's so many things you can do.
[01:42:20.948 --> 01:42:25.591]  Or sponsor local radio shows.
[01:42:25.611 --> 01:42:27.632]  You hear something you support and believe in, support it.
[01:42:28.353 --> 01:42:29.393]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[01:42:29.753 --> 01:42:30.714]  Let's blitz through some calls.
[01:42:30.754 --> 01:42:31.935]  I'm going to get into global warming here.
[01:42:32.675 --> 01:42:34.116]  Chris in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:42:34.156 --> 01:42:34.476]  Welcome.
[01:42:35.376 --> 01:42:37.698]  Thanks, Alex, for helping me in my pursuit of happiness.
[01:42:38.859 --> 01:42:49.047]  I wanted to let you know that I called Neil Bortz a couple times recently, and just to give you a summary of how the conversation went, he's afraid to talk about Ron Paul and you.
[01:42:50.048 --> 01:42:58.354]  Two weeks ago today, I started out telling him, I doubt that you support libertarian principles because you haven't supported Ron Paul, who announced he's running.
[01:42:59.175 --> 01:43:00.576]  And Neil asked if he's running.
[01:43:00.636 --> 01:43:02.838]  I answered that he just announced his candidacy.
[01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:09.954]  And he said he doesn't agree with Ron Paul on everything, but he's certainly a better candidate than any Democrat.
[01:43:10.574 --> 01:43:16.777]  I asked on what doesn't he agree with Ron Paul, so he asked me if I agreed with him on everything.
[01:43:17.218 --> 01:43:26.583]  I answered, I can't find anything on which we disagree, and asked him again on what doesn't he like about, or what doesn't he agree with, or what doesn't he like about Ron Paul.
[01:43:27.589 --> 01:43:30.512]  And Neil answered that Ron Paul is too much of an isolationist.
[01:43:30.592 --> 01:43:32.114]  So I said that he is an isolationist.
[01:43:32.134 --> 01:43:32.735]  So there you go.
[01:43:32.775 --> 01:43:34.436]  He's not for the North American Union.
[01:43:34.456 --> 01:43:34.737]  Right.
[01:43:34.857 --> 01:43:37.379]  He's not for the fake Republican gun grabbers.
[01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:42.605]  And I said, yes, he's an isolationist, but what makes him an isolationist?
[01:43:43.226 --> 01:43:49.948]  So Neil answered that he wouldn't go into libertarian principles right now, maybe some other time.
[01:43:49.988 --> 01:43:50.568]  Yeah, he couldn't.
[01:43:50.608 --> 01:43:50.928]  He couldn't.
[01:43:51.068 --> 01:43:59.491]  Listen, he came to TalkFest Saturday for KLBJ, and I was on for an hour with George Norrie there, and he spent a large portion of his two hours savaging me.
[01:44:00.111 --> 01:44:02.812]  He spent a lot of time saying that I'm the leftovers of a fruitcake.
[01:44:03.072 --> 01:44:05.313]  And again, it's all flying saucers, fruitcakes.
[01:44:05.633 --> 01:44:07.733]  He can't address any meat and potatoes.
[01:44:08.013 --> 01:44:09.634]  He can't come after me on facts.
[01:44:10.274 --> 01:44:10.915]  Yeah, I saw that.
[01:44:32.734 --> 01:44:35.756]  Well, I thought I saw where you had confronted him at Ground Zero.
[01:44:36.296 --> 01:44:36.776]  I guess I did.
[01:44:36.796 --> 01:44:38.757]  That was in the RNC convention.
[01:44:39.037 --> 01:44:40.058]  I guess I forgot about that.
[01:44:40.078 --> 01:44:43.639]  I guess one of my guys put it up on the web.
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:45:00.608]  So he said he would get into libertarian principle some other time, and I answered, well, since he had already complimented Ron Paul as being better than any Democrat, I told him that there are two areas I think he would disagree with Ron Paul on, and that those are that he questioned the official story of 9-11,
[01:45:01.659 --> 01:45:04.681]  And Alex Jones does support him, at which point he dumped my call.
[01:45:05.741 --> 01:45:14.346]  Two weeks before that, I called him and asked him, what did Alex Jones say and when did he say it that would make you call him a nutjob?
[01:45:14.386 --> 01:45:15.767]  Because he's been saying that on the show.
[01:45:16.308 --> 01:45:17.788]  So he cut me off.
[01:45:17.828 --> 01:45:25.453]  He refused to comment and said, of course, that you accused Bush of causing 9-11, which is not at all surprising considering that's a talking point.
[01:45:26.253 --> 01:45:26.333]  And...
[01:45:28.970 --> 01:45:36.774]  Before that, I had called him and let him know about Rumsfeld's incompetence, the $3 trillion that Cynthia McKinney asked about the Pentagon losing.
[01:45:36.854 --> 01:45:38.035]  And it's now almost $4 trillion.
[01:45:38.695 --> 01:45:39.075]  Oh, right.
[01:45:39.816 --> 01:45:42.557]  And Dynacourt and Halliburton's white slave trade.
[01:45:42.597 --> 01:45:47.120]  So he immediately done my call and said, once you say white slave ring, I have to cut you off.
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:50.522]  Oh, even when it's in the Chicago Tribune?
[01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:52.059]  Sure, sure.
[01:45:52.579 --> 01:45:55.762]  He said, well, I'd argue with you, but you don't sound like you're a very fun caller.
[01:45:55.802 --> 01:45:56.762]  That's his excuse.
[01:45:57.523 --> 01:46:02.607]  Last week, Neil asked what president is most responsible for inflaming the terrorists.
[01:46:03.327 --> 01:46:12.054]  Someone knowledgeable on Project Ajax called to tell him that it happened under Eisenhower, and Neil said he hadn't heard about it, and he would look into it.
[01:46:12.915 --> 01:46:15.016]  So I'm just letting you know what Neil is aware of.
[01:46:15.036 --> 01:46:19.680]  Oh, that guy's an establishment bootlicker posing as a libertarian.
[01:46:20.387 --> 01:46:20.927]  I know, I know.
[01:46:20.987 --> 01:46:31.633]  I just wanted to let you know that someone has called him on it, and I'd encourage somebody else to ask him, where did you or anybody claim that George Bush is responsible for 9-11?
[01:46:32.213 --> 01:46:34.935]  The people that control Bush carried out the attacks.
[01:46:34.995 --> 01:46:39.697]  Bush is a gibbering, obviously brain-damaged twit.
[01:46:39.737 --> 01:46:40.477]  Thank you for the call.
[01:46:40.978 --> 01:46:41.878]  I appreciate that.
[01:46:42.518 --> 01:46:47.041]  Let's go ahead and talk to Anthony in Nebraska.
[01:46:47.081 --> 01:46:47.641]  You're on the air.
[01:46:47.701 --> 01:46:48.101]  Go ahead.
[01:46:48.121 --> 01:46:49.342]  Hey, Alex.
[01:46:50.225 --> 01:46:50.645]  Hello sir.
[01:46:51.106 --> 01:47:00.192]  I would just like to ask you how can we seriously win this when no matter how many people we got in a protest it would just take one neutron bomb or a carpet bombing run to take us all out?
[01:47:01.135 --> 01:47:09.097]  Well, they have to have Air Force or Army pilots or Marine pilots that are willing to drop those bombs, and they're not willing to do that.
[01:47:09.137 --> 01:47:16.318]  That's why they have now moved towards making a large portion of our ground forces foreign-born illegal aliens who they legalize.
[01:47:16.498 --> 01:47:19.399]  AP, Boston Globe, Neil Bortz, of course, will deny it.
[01:47:19.899 --> 01:47:26.760]  That's why they're opening up giant or expanding existing recruiting stations from Manila to the Ukraine to Mexico City, the city.
[01:47:27.641 --> 01:47:27.781]  And...
[01:47:30.117 --> 01:47:37.882]  Again, that's why by 2011, half the Air Force fleet will be drone, remote control, so elites can do that in a compartmentalized fashion.
[01:47:38.162 --> 01:47:44.286]  That's what's the problem with the mechanized robotic forces that they're moving towards and phasing out human-controlled.
[01:47:44.787 --> 01:47:47.388]  So it can be centralized, and we're heading into dark times.
[01:47:47.408 --> 01:47:51.191]  That's why the Air Force Secretary says they should test out microwave guns.
[01:47:51.491 --> 01:47:52.151]  I hope you're right, man.
[01:48:14.588 --> 01:48:16.409]  Well, that's pretty much all I was calling for.
[01:48:16.429 --> 01:48:17.570]  Thank you.
[01:48:17.610 --> 01:48:19.451]  We're fighting very serious individuals here.
[01:48:19.912 --> 01:48:22.213]  John in California, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:48:22.233 --> 01:48:23.934]  Hi, Alex.
[01:48:24.294 --> 01:48:32.260]  I'd like to start off by saying I'm a long-time listener, and I want to thank you for doing your part in this information war we're in.
[01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:34.621]  Thank you.
[01:48:34.961 --> 01:48:36.362]  Well, I have two things.
[01:48:36.422 --> 01:48:37.543]  I want a recommendation.
[01:48:37.563 --> 01:48:41.686]  I want to agree with a certain part of your tactics.
[01:48:42.541 --> 01:48:50.227]  My recommendation is, not too long ago I had a little player on my MySpace page that played your radio program every day.
[01:48:50.668 --> 01:48:58.975]  My recommendation would be on either InfoWars or presentplanet.com to put a little line of code for people to copy so they can do the same thing.
[01:48:58.995 --> 01:49:02.678]  There's a lot of stuff we need to do.
[01:49:02.718 --> 01:49:03.939]  We need all your recommendations.
[01:49:04.299 --> 01:49:06.961]  Write the code for us, send it to us, and we'll do it.
[01:49:06.981 --> 01:49:07.802]  All right.
[01:49:08.202 --> 01:49:10.264]  And my disagreement is,
[01:49:11.508 --> 01:49:14.390]  You personally have a lot of power, Alex.
[01:49:14.410 --> 01:49:16.292]  Oh, please.
[01:49:16.753 --> 01:49:29.185]  A while ago, not too long ago, you were talking about Google Video and the very same day you were talking about Terror Storm on Google Video, that video hit Google Video's top 100.
[01:49:30.370 --> 01:49:34.495]  Same thing happened with Amazon.com's Terror Storm copy.
[01:49:35.115 --> 01:49:36.156]  I don't have the power.
[01:49:36.376 --> 01:49:37.017]  You did it.
[01:49:37.237 --> 01:49:38.138]  You have the power.
[01:49:38.218 --> 01:49:38.939]  Look in the mirror.
[01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:39.740]  Stay there.
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:41.582]  I'll find out what you disagree about.
[01:49:42.583 --> 01:49:43.124]  Stay with us.
[01:49:43.224 --> 01:49:49.651]  PrisonPlanet.com Infowars.com JonesReport.com Infowars.net MartialLaw911.info Stay with us.
[01:49:51.736 --> 01:49:59.659]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:03.321]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[01:50:03.681 --> 01:50:06.742]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.
[01:50:07.123 --> 01:50:11.925]  Just visit HerbalHealer.com and shop online or request a free catalog.
[01:50:12.365 --> 01:50:14.706]  You're bound to find the alternative you're looking for.

[01:50:20.639 --> 01:50:26.525]  You can also count on Herbal Healer for the largest selection of safe and natural supplements just for children.
[01:50:26.826 --> 01:50:27.967]  And don't forget your pets.
[01:50:28.447 --> 01:50:34.114]  Herbal Healer even has natural mineral supplements for all your animals, including horses, cows, and birds.
[01:50:34.574 --> 01:50:35.134]  We're good to go.
[01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:57.564]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:57.924 --> 01:50:59.825]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:51:00.206 --> 01:51:07.852]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:08.556 --> 01:51:15.599]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:15.999 --> 01:51:27.404]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:51:27.744 --> 01:51:31.665]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:51:31.705 --> 01:51:33.646]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:51:33.966 --> 01:51:37.808]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:51:38.408 --> 01:51:45.401]  Get your copy today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:51:50.925 --> 01:51:56.029]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:51:56.089 --> 01:52:03.395]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:52:03.535 --> 01:52:14.184]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:52:14.384 --> 01:52:18.928]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:52:19.188 --> 01:52:24.191]  Unbelievably, they even remove small microparticulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:52:24.391 --> 01:52:27.332]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:52:27.552 --> 01:52:37.377]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[01:52:37.517 --> 01:52:39.438]  We don't need no education We don't need no thought control
[01:53:24.009 --> 01:53:24.949]  This just in.
[01:53:26.190 --> 01:53:29.592]  U.S.-Iraq surge could total 50,000 troops.
[01:53:29.632 --> 01:53:32.133]  Congressional report from Defense News.
[01:53:33.094 --> 01:53:34.855]  We already told you that months ago.
[01:53:35.495 --> 01:53:37.737]  Chinese Army harvesting body parts.
[01:53:38.669 --> 01:53:39.410]  We'll cover that.
[01:53:39.450 --> 01:53:41.311]  This is from the agency French Press.
[01:53:41.331 --> 01:53:44.794]  And we're going to continue with phone calls coming up.
[01:53:44.834 --> 01:53:50.099]  I'm going to air some of my questions and answers from last night's huge success event at UT.
[01:53:50.159 --> 01:53:54.662]  I've got two callers here that disagree, so I've got to go to Jeff at the head of the line here in a minute, then Raphael.
[01:53:54.682 --> 01:53:57.545]  But finish up what you disagree with, John, in California.
[01:53:57.585 --> 01:53:57.985]  Go ahead.
[01:53:58.265 --> 01:53:58.546]  Yes.
[01:53:58.986 --> 01:54:06.012]  The reason I brought up the terror storm recommendations and telling people it hits the top of the list
[01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:16.123]  I always hear you do that, but for us to really win this information war, we need people not to use the electronic voting machines in 2008.
[01:54:17.384 --> 01:54:22.531]  My disagreement is that I never hear you bring up that issue and I'd like to hear you
[01:54:23.032 --> 01:54:26.214]  We must be missing the show, because I talk about it two or three times a month.
[01:54:26.595 --> 01:54:28.816]  We have guests on when elections heat up.
[01:54:28.856 --> 01:54:30.137]  We constantly talk about it.
[01:54:30.497 --> 01:54:32.178]  We're trying to stop World War III.
[01:54:32.198 --> 01:54:33.920]  We're trying to expose government-sponsored terror.
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:38.543]  We're trying to stop them making little girls take live cancer viruses.
[01:54:39.223 --> 01:54:41.305]  That's Associated Press.
[01:54:41.505 --> 01:54:45.928]  I'm trying to hit every issue to get everybody informed on all the basics.
[01:54:46.168 --> 01:54:52.473]  Well, a lot of people that listen to your show don't listen every day.
[01:54:53.093 --> 01:54:54.574]  And those two times a month?
[01:54:54.694 --> 01:55:00.496]  It's something like 85% of the American people don't like these new no-record electronic voting machines.
[01:55:00.536 --> 01:55:07.158]  Listen, I appreciate your call, and we do do reports on that, and the governor of Florida is now moving to ban these machines.
[01:55:07.198 --> 01:55:10.719]  Good stuff's happening, and so I agree it's a central issue.
[01:55:10.759 --> 01:55:11.159]  Thank you.
[01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:13.700]  Let's talk to Jeff in Pennsylvania.
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:14.541]  You go ahead, sir.
[01:55:15.521 --> 01:55:16.081]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:16.161 --> 01:55:20.983]  If I can make a couple points about a couple issues, and you could respond to me off-air, please.
[01:55:22.145 --> 01:55:22.705]  Off air?
[01:55:23.946 --> 01:55:24.306]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:24.646 --> 01:55:25.647]  Oh, you mean once you're gone?
[01:55:26.247 --> 01:55:26.527]  Yes.
[01:55:26.787 --> 01:55:27.368]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:55:27.388 --> 01:55:32.950]  All right, you've said that cell phones pose a risk and are dangerous to our health.
[01:55:33.071 --> 01:55:40.154]  I'm surprised you haven't covered a story that has come out in Yahoo News and other outlets about a Danish study that was conducted.
[01:55:40.214 --> 01:55:42.075]  Now, this study tracked 420,000 cell phone users
[01:55:44.358 --> 01:55:47.839]  Including 52,000 people who had used the phones for 10 years or more.
[01:55:48.039 --> 01:55:56.662]  And it found that you have a 40 plus percent chance of developing a tumor just where Johnny Cochran got one?
[01:55:57.703 --> 01:56:04.245]  Well now in Denmark every citizen at birth has a health record that's created that tracks the diseases and cancers they get.
[01:56:04.585 --> 01:56:10.907]  Now the study cross-referenced the cell phone users with their health records and it compared it to the rest of the population and
[01:56:11.525 --> 01:56:17.156]  Out of 420,000 users, only 14,269 were diagnosed with cancer.
[01:56:17.556 --> 01:56:21.083]  And this doesn't specify whether it was brain related or caused by cell phones, but
[01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:24.552]  That's fewer than the 15,000 that was predicted.
[01:56:25.533 --> 01:56:25.733]  Sure.
[01:56:25.773 --> 01:56:28.875]  I think it must be another report out of the same country you're talking about.
[01:56:29.335 --> 01:56:30.576]  It was in the Associated Press.
[01:56:30.596 --> 01:56:32.678]  It was in a bunch of publications earlier this week.
[01:56:33.378 --> 01:56:38.322]  Other big scientific studies using medical records showing a huge increase in brain tumors.
[01:56:39.323 --> 01:56:48.869]  All I know is it is a microwave relay system, and it does, a scientific fact, heat the brain over one degree after a 30-minute call.
[01:56:48.889 --> 01:56:49.650]  I forget the exact date.
[01:56:56.294 --> 01:57:05.439]  Well, this study is saying that the cancer rates in the rest of the population and the cancer rates of cell phone users, at least in this study, seems to be about the same.
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:08.501]  Okay, well, I'll have to look at that, so please send it to me.
[01:57:08.942 --> 01:57:09.502]  We've got a break.
[01:57:09.522 --> 01:57:10.563]  What's the other thing you disagree with?
[01:57:11.643 --> 01:57:15.906]  Privacy issues and some things about 9-11, but I'll go over it really quick.
[01:57:16.781 --> 01:57:22.647]  Yeah, we've got to move quick because I've got other calls, and I want to get a little bit into global warming, and I've got to air these questions from last night.
[01:57:22.667 --> 01:57:23.488]  So just stay there.
[01:57:24.049 --> 01:57:29.294]  We're going to have a 70-second break with a network ID, and we'll come right back to you.
[01:57:31.677 --> 01:57:35.581]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:35.901 --> 01:57:36.702]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:47.925 --> 01:57:48.566]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.226 --> 01:57:50.306]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.006 --> 01:57:52.086]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:52.767 --> 01:57:53.567]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.327 --> 01:57:55.247]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.907 --> 01:57:59.628]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.068 --> 01:58:04.189]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:05.250 --> 01:58:08.631]  We had some great questions last night at the UT Union Ballroom.
[01:58:08.651 --> 01:58:11.751]  I'm going to play about 28 minutes of that and the rest of the shower.
[01:58:11.771 --> 01:58:14.052]  I also wanted to get a little bit into global warming.
[01:58:15.695 --> 01:58:16.855]  Some of the new developments there.
[01:58:16.875 --> 01:58:19.616]  I'll also be on the radio Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:58:19.676 --> 01:58:19.996]  Central.
[01:58:20.016 --> 01:58:25.498]  You can listen over the Internet at InfoWars.com or any of the great affiliates that are turning us on.
[01:58:27.299 --> 01:58:29.339]  Jeff in Pennsylvania said he disagreed about a few things.
[01:58:29.599 --> 01:58:30.500]  And now I remember.
[01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:32.200]  It was actually about a week or two ago.
[01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:34.021]  A big study came out of Europe.
[01:58:34.061 --> 01:58:40.623]  Another big study came out of the same country about how it did increase the frequency of that specific case.
[01:58:41.337 --> 01:58:45.559]  But I do remember saying it didn't show an increase in cancers in another study.
[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:53.563]  But there are just literally hundreds of these studies, and we know that the cell phone does heat the brain.
[01:58:55.363 --> 01:59:01.646]  One big study said that it actually increases intelligence while it's heating the brain.
[01:59:01.666 --> 01:59:08.889]  It also had that effect in tests they did where when people had it up against their head, somehow it increased brain activity.
[01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:10.090]  Really bizarre.
[01:59:11.127 --> 01:59:11.607]  We're good to go.
[01:59:31.005 --> 01:59:35.066]  Because you can get RF burns, I mean physical burns, on your skin.
[01:59:35.786 --> 01:59:39.288]  And so I'm trying to really understand what the caller was saying.
[01:59:39.448 --> 01:59:41.268]  But getting into his other issues, we don't have much time.
[01:59:41.708 --> 01:59:43.209]  You said you disagreed about a couple other things.
[01:59:43.269 --> 01:59:43.629]  Go ahead.
[01:59:44.929 --> 01:59:53.292]  Well, I know you've covered a couple stories lately about the FBI wiretapping, our leader opening mail.
[01:59:53.552 --> 02:00:00.634]  And when I hear critics of our president talking about supposed privacy violations,
[02:00:01.776 --> 02:00:08.518]  I laugh and I remind them that not only are we fighting a war on terror, but if you have nothing to hide, why are you complaining?
[02:00:08.678 --> 02:00:11.358]  And it pretty much leaves them speechless every time.
[02:00:11.538 --> 02:00:12.918]  Is this called a joke?
[02:00:13.499 --> 02:00:14.439]  I mean, is this a joke?
[02:00:15.079 --> 02:00:19.620]  We have a Fourth Amendment, and if you say you have nothing to hide, why are you complaining?
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:26.722]  Historically, you can't trust governments to do these type of things, and every time they do, it gets abusive and out of control and bad.
[02:00:26.742 --> 02:00:27.482]  You know, the...
[02:00:29.382 --> 02:00:47.817]  USA Today, four years ago, reported in a headline, something like, scofflaws get caught ordering pizzas, that the big three pizza companies run you through a private company in Dallas that hooks into the federal and state governments, so when you call to order a pizza, there's a warrant, they flag it and send the police, because now they know your real address.
[02:00:48.338 --> 02:00:49.839]  I mean, you've got to be kidding.
[02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:54.863]  First Bush said they weren't going to use the Patriot Act on citizens, now they are.
[02:00:54.883 --> 02:00:56.864]  I mean, what are you saying?
[02:00:59.406 --> 02:01:05.888]  Historically, we've never had a 9-11 either, and our defenses are still weak since 9-11.
[02:01:05.948 --> 02:01:14.931]  So you really buy into the fact that Al-Qaeda really hit us, and the war in Iraq's good, and George Bush has told us the truth, and George Bush is good?
[02:01:15.885 --> 02:01:22.688]  Well, 911myths.com and debunking 911.com do a pretty good job of it.
[02:01:22.928 --> 02:01:25.329]  And there's sites debunking that.
[02:01:25.349 --> 02:01:29.490]  They either build straw men, or they do attack legitimate cooks, or they make things up.
[02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:33.251]  So, I mean, sir, do you think the North American Union exists?
[02:01:33.271 --> 02:01:34.132]  Do you think we're going into that?
[02:01:35.232 --> 02:01:42.655]  Well, look, I mean, there was NAFTA, and it created a lot of good opportunities, and it really helped the economy out.
[02:01:43.499 --> 02:01:50.403]  But, I mean, to the extent of some kind of European Union, you know, the European countries are still sovereign.
[02:01:51.323 --> 02:01:51.904]  No, they're not.
[02:01:52.024 --> 02:01:58.027]  In fact, they've lost many of their rights and liberties, and the people are trying to vote themselves out of it, and the government isn't letting them do that.
[02:01:58.347 --> 02:02:00.369]  I mean, is it good to not let the people have what they want?
[02:02:01.829 --> 02:02:09.174]  Well, if it's for the greater good and everybody can agree on something peaceful, I don't see that there's anything wrong with it.
[02:02:09.254 --> 02:02:10.234]  Hey, what do you do?
[02:02:10.294 --> 02:02:10.814]  I'm just curious.
[02:02:10.835 --> 02:02:11.615]  What do you do for a living?
[02:02:12.629 --> 02:02:13.850]  I called him before.
[02:02:13.950 --> 02:02:17.191]  I'm a social worker with CBS.
[02:02:19.072 --> 02:02:19.953]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:20.013 --> 02:02:20.933]  I really appreciate it.
[02:02:21.013 --> 02:02:22.874]  It's always nice to hear from folks like you.
[02:02:24.175 --> 02:02:24.715]  Really nice.
[02:02:25.515 --> 02:02:27.256]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[02:02:27.456 --> 02:02:31.699]  I'm going to hit a little bit of global warming, a few more calls, and then I've got to get to the speech.
[02:02:32.079 --> 02:02:32.439]  Stay with me.
[02:02:41.915 --> 02:02:45.096]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:45.437 --> 02:02:47.337]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:47.738 --> 02:02:55.361]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:02:56.061 --> 02:03:03.125]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:03.525 --> 02:03:14.931]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:15.251 --> 02:03:18.733]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:19.234 --> 02:03:21.155]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:21.475 --> 02:03:25.317]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[02:03:25.917 --> 02:03:37.862]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:03:40.182 --> 02:03:41.223]  The war on terrorism.
[02:03:41.543 --> 02:03:44.324]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:44.604 --> 02:03:48.746]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:49.186 --> 02:03:50.026]  So what do you do?
[02:03:50.326 --> 02:03:54.888]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:03:55.388 --> 02:03:57.509]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:03:57.989 --> 02:04:12.696]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:12.736 --> 02:04:19.800]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:20.380]  That's 888-803-4438.

[02:04:38.874 --> 02:04:41.216]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:04:41.476 --> 02:04:43.518]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:04:43.638 --> 02:04:50.725]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:04:50.965 --> 02:04:59.493]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:36.930]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:41.471]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:42.031 --> 02:05:44.871]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:46.732 --> 02:05:47.872]  Now we have two cameras...
[02:05:49.355 --> 02:05:49.715]  We're good to go.
[02:06:16.033 --> 02:06:19.194]  Ten minutes, we'll start playing it and play it out to the end of the show.
[02:06:21.555 --> 02:06:23.656]  Let me go over some of the new news that came out.
[02:06:23.716 --> 02:06:27.118]  I remember Bush saying 20,000 troops, and he said 40,000 more.
[02:06:28.878 --> 02:06:32.200]  And then I saw discussions by Congress of 50,000 to 80,000 more troops.
[02:06:33.020 --> 02:06:35.181]  So first they condition you to accept a surge.
[02:06:36.601 --> 02:06:39.483]  Then that surge expands from 21,600 to 50,000 and then to 80,000.
[02:06:44.286 --> 02:06:47.188]  So the American people, 70 plus percent, want us out of the war.
[02:06:47.668 --> 02:06:49.629]  The troops, 70 plus percent, want us out of there.
[02:06:51.150 --> 02:06:53.972]  Their answer is, no.
[02:06:55.533 --> 02:06:57.274]  In fact, we're going to increase the troops.
[02:06:57.294 --> 02:06:58.055]  They're never leaving.
[02:06:58.075 --> 02:06:59.296]  They've built permanent bases.
[02:06:59.716 --> 02:07:03.298]  They're going to widen the revolution, the destabilization, and it's World War III.
[02:07:04.619 --> 02:07:08.842]  Unless we somehow take this government over and take the criminals in it down.
[02:07:09.861 --> 02:07:10.942]  Defense news today.
[02:07:11.322 --> 02:07:14.064]  U.S.-Iraq surge could total 50,000 troops.
[02:07:16.186 --> 02:07:17.406]  Congressional report.
[02:07:18.727 --> 02:07:19.368]  A new U.S.
[02:07:19.408 --> 02:07:30.656]  congressional report says the increase of 21,500, I thought it was 21,600, combat troops for Iraq proposed by the Bush administration could result in up to 50,000 troops actually being deployed to the region.
[02:07:31.348 --> 02:07:45.294]  The report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office based that projection on the fact that the Bush plan is unclear about whether 21,500 troops needed to quell violence or all combat troops, or if that number already increased means support forces.
[02:07:45.594 --> 02:07:47.795]  And then it goes on to why the President is saying that.
[02:07:50.706 --> 02:07:54.367]  Also, the news of Australia picking up a French news agency report.
[02:07:54.927 --> 02:07:56.928]  Chinese army harvesting body parts.
[02:07:56.988 --> 02:07:58.228]  We told you this ten years ago.
[02:07:58.848 --> 02:08:10.671]  China's military is harvesting organs from unwilling live prison inmates, mostly Falun Gong practitioners, from transplants on large scale, including to foreign recipients, according to the study.
[02:08:11.512 --> 02:08:13.972]  They put them on dry ice and fly them into Europe.
[02:08:14.312 --> 02:08:15.493]  They try to fly them to the U.S.
[02:08:15.533 --> 02:08:16.773]  That's really, they don't stay fresh.
[02:08:17.533 --> 02:08:19.774]  Most people just go to China to private and governmental...
[02:08:20.976 --> 02:08:22.456]  Medical institutions to have it done.
[02:08:23.377 --> 02:08:25.297]  They also take dead babies.
[02:08:25.337 --> 02:08:26.157]  They also kill.
[02:08:26.217 --> 02:08:29.358]  If somebody has over three children, two, they will just take the child.
[02:08:30.678 --> 02:08:31.498]  Sometimes they kill them.
[02:08:32.438 --> 02:08:33.639]  But again, Americans don't want to admit that.
[02:08:33.679 --> 02:08:34.779]  So they'll just say, oh, it's not true.
[02:08:34.799 --> 02:08:35.199]  It's not true.
[02:08:35.219 --> 02:08:42.101]  For all these years, the State Department comes out and says, we're exposing disinformation two years ago and says there's no organ harvesting in China.
[02:08:43.421 --> 02:08:48.702]  And then you can find on the State Department a report from two or three years before that detailing the organ harvesting.
[02:08:48.802 --> 02:08:48.842]  Ha!
[02:08:50.996 --> 02:08:58.812]  China's military is harvesting organs from unwilling live prison inmates, mostly Falun Gong practitioners, for large-scale transplants, including foreign recipients.
[02:08:59.674 --> 02:09:01.437]  The report's authors, Canada's former...
[02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:11.877]  Secretary of State in the Asia Pacific region, David Kilgore, and human rights lawyer David Mattis implicated dozens of hospitals and jails throughout China in July.
[02:09:12.197 --> 02:09:16.220]  After a two-month investigation, Chinese officials denied the allegations.
[02:09:16.941 --> 02:09:23.366]  The official government puts out press releases and full-color catalogs advertising it.
[02:09:23.746 --> 02:09:25.448]  They have mobile execution vans.
[02:09:26.733 --> 02:09:27.294]  And it goes on.
[02:09:27.634 --> 02:09:32.257]  These are being posted on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com and jonesreport.com.
[02:09:32.277 --> 02:09:33.058]  We just gave it to them.
[02:09:33.358 --> 02:09:34.279]  It's going up right now.
[02:09:36.780 --> 02:09:39.983]  I wanted to get into global warming, but we're just running out of time here.
[02:09:40.003 --> 02:09:46.748]  I don't know if I can really do justice to this, but let me just say this.
[02:09:50.268 --> 02:09:52.790]  I'm not saying there isn't climate change.
[02:09:53.011 --> 02:09:54.652]  There's always been climate change.
[02:09:54.732 --> 02:09:57.274]  I'm not saying humans don't contribute in a small way to it.
[02:09:57.535 --> 02:10:03.680]  Because I've actually spent many days put together, all the time I've spent looking at this, interviewing top experts.
[02:10:04.641 --> 02:10:06.723]  Clearly it's not good to burn down a rainforest.
[02:10:06.803 --> 02:10:10.466]  Clearly it's not good to dump toxic waste in the oceans.
[02:10:10.526 --> 02:10:15.111]  Clearly the genetic engineering is leaking into the biosphere, causing major problems.
[02:10:15.551 --> 02:10:16.672]  But most of that gets ignored.
[02:10:18.018 --> 02:10:35.261]  Their solution to climate change is a global tax on fossil fuels and western industry, further de-industrializing us and transferring that to the third world, which the globalists control, and then use the slave goods to further leverage out any pockets of capital that they don't control and any industry they don't control.
[02:10:36.557 --> 02:10:44.281]  NASA, the European Space Agency, the Japanese Space Agency, every major university, these are hardcore scientific numbers.
[02:10:44.301 --> 02:10:46.042]  I had a physicist on yesterday talking about it.
[02:10:46.362 --> 02:10:50.284]  It's in all the major journals, not in these propaganda pieces you hear about in the news.
[02:10:50.705 --> 02:10:55.347]  The sun hit its biggest cycle the last 12 years.
[02:10:55.447 --> 02:10:56.808]  It's right under 12 years.
[02:10:56.868 --> 02:10:58.589]  It's like 11 and a half years.
[02:10:59.209 --> 02:11:01.010]  And they're saying that it didn't cool down.
[02:11:01.130 --> 02:11:03.932]  It's just increasing its total emissions.
[02:11:04.705 --> 02:11:14.070]  And they're saying if it continues to grow and continues to expand its emissions through the next 12-year cycle, the sun will double in brightness.
[02:11:15.991 --> 02:11:19.132]  This report came out last year by NASA and others, a bunch of reports.
[02:11:19.572 --> 02:11:22.674]  It will double in brightness in the next 10 years.
[02:11:24.935 --> 02:11:27.836]  Now, let's just hope it reverses itself, because things aren't going to be pretty.
[02:11:30.137 --> 02:11:30.538]  All right?
[02:11:31.938 --> 02:11:32.919]  And the sun does this.
[02:11:35.222 --> 02:11:37.783]  They've only been registering and metering it for 100 years.
[02:11:38.703 --> 02:11:40.743]  The entire solar system is warming.
[02:11:41.063 --> 02:11:43.984]  Moons that are ice around Jupiter and Saturn are melting.
[02:11:44.004 --> 02:11:45.444]  They now have liquid oceans.
[02:11:49.225 --> 02:11:51.125]  Liquid methane oceans.
[02:11:51.925 --> 02:11:53.906]  Liquid saltwater oceans.
[02:11:54.666 --> 02:11:55.706]  It's happening.
[02:11:57.067 --> 02:12:01.087]  SUVs have nothing to do with it.
[02:12:01.588 --> 02:12:03.728]  Absolutely zero.
[02:12:06.035 --> 02:12:07.036]  Total zero.
[02:12:07.896 --> 02:12:08.237]  Nothing.
[02:12:08.297 --> 02:12:08.977]  It's the sun.
[02:12:09.738 --> 02:12:19.184]  And you look at the studies, depending on which study, even the Human Zone Report says humans, and this came out a month ago, they go, it's not as bad as we thought, but humans, you know, it is 3-6%.
[02:12:20.485 --> 02:12:21.366]  And that's the tipping.
[02:12:21.406 --> 02:12:23.207]  That's causing it to accelerate.
[02:12:24.388 --> 02:12:28.130]  So, you know, the increases, let's look at it as a chart of 1-100, 6% of that is human.
[02:12:31.348 --> 02:12:35.490]  If you add in the cow's flatulence, there's always been bovine in large numbers.
[02:12:35.890 --> 02:12:39.632]  And if you add in the burning and you add in the fossil fuels and the factories, 6%.
[02:12:40.052 --> 02:12:45.555]  Ice shelves are always contracting and expanding.
[02:12:46.475 --> 02:12:50.357]  Polar bears are always, sometimes swimming 200 miles, they've always been on ice floes.
[02:12:52.646 --> 02:12:55.289]  But they show you a polar bear like a bald eagle and say it's dying.
[02:12:55.589 --> 02:12:56.971]  It's the new poster boy for this.
[02:12:57.471 --> 02:12:58.532]  And they have stunts.
[02:12:58.592 --> 02:13:01.035]  They have stunts that push this global tax.
[02:13:01.075 --> 02:13:11.345]  I just read to you four releases from the North American summit last year in September in Canada where they said we need to use this as a pretext for a North American union.
[02:13:11.366 --> 02:13:12.687]  It has nothing to do with it.
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:16.620]  And they have all these stunts.
[02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:18.561]  Oh, turn the lights off on the Eiffel Tower.
[02:13:18.801 --> 02:13:23.523]  Prince Charles isn't going to fly on his private jet to one meeting and then he's going to publicize it.
[02:13:25.543 --> 02:13:28.064]  Oh, the NFL is going to plant some trees at the Super Bowl.
[02:13:30.525 --> 02:13:35.947]  See, this is corporate America wanting a global tax that will then extract the wealth of the nations and put it into their coffers.
[02:13:35.967 --> 02:13:36.947]  They control the UN.
[02:13:37.187 --> 02:13:38.727]  They control the IMF and World Bank.
[02:13:40.528 --> 02:13:41.828]  The World Trade Organization.
[02:13:42.669 --> 02:13:43.469]  The XM Bank.
[02:13:44.051 --> 02:13:45.192]  The World Health Organization.
[02:13:45.232 --> 02:13:47.013]  It's all about control, consolidation.
[02:13:47.033 --> 02:13:47.873]  They're monopoly men.
[02:13:49.534 --> 02:13:51.595]  And so, here's the Associated Press.
[02:13:51.615 --> 02:13:52.275]  This is big news.
[02:13:52.575 --> 02:13:57.598]  British scientist, chimp cry, wakes up Paris climate talks.
[02:13:58.238 --> 02:13:59.399]  See, it's all stunts.
[02:13:59.839 --> 02:14:04.001]  Oh my gosh, the climate must be totally destroyed, because she can go... I mean, come on!
[02:14:11.522 --> 02:14:12.962]  It's turning off Eiffel Towers.
[02:14:13.022 --> 02:14:16.223]  It's showing you polar bears in a cute pose.
[02:14:16.463 --> 02:14:18.703]  It's a woman doing a chimpanzee call.
[02:14:21.804 --> 02:14:22.664]  I'm sick of it!
[02:14:25.785 --> 02:14:28.665]  It's stunt after stunt.
[02:14:29.026 --> 02:14:30.086]  I've got my blood pressure up.
[02:14:30.566 --> 02:14:34.507]  After stunt, after stunt, after stunt.
[02:14:36.047 --> 02:14:37.727]  Can't you see six months ago?
[02:14:37.747 --> 02:14:41.108]  This was kicked off a year ago with the Inconvenient Truth.
[02:14:43.308 --> 02:14:46.410]  They kick it off and the panicking and the hysteria starts.
[02:14:51.553 --> 02:14:52.534]  France tells U.S.
[02:14:52.574 --> 02:14:54.535]  to sign climate pacts or face tax.
[02:14:54.555 --> 02:14:57.117]  They're just going to tax us with goods that go over there anyway, see?
[02:14:58.537 --> 02:14:59.378]  Economic warfare.
[02:14:59.798 --> 02:15:02.080]  Scientists offer cash to dispute climate study.
[02:15:05.582 --> 02:15:08.684]  Global warming sees polar bears stranded on melting ice.
[02:15:09.444 --> 02:15:12.206]  Queen's growing concern over Ica warrior Charles.
[02:15:13.286 --> 02:15:15.229]  Her husband says we should basically all be killed.
[02:15:15.829 --> 02:15:17.872]  Al Gore nominated for Nobel Peace Prize.
[02:15:18.312 --> 02:15:25.681]  And if you don't think that's funny, Landmark Legal Foundation nominates Rush Limbaugh for Nobel Peace Prize.
[02:15:25.701 --> 02:15:31.107]  They ought to nominate him for supporting their drug companies.
[02:15:31.147 --> 02:15:32.188]  You could take 100 Oxycontin a day.
[02:15:35.043 --> 02:15:38.505]  Walmart boss says he'll press suppliers in race to go green.
[02:15:38.885 --> 02:15:41.947]  See, Walmart got adopted the universal product code.
[02:15:42.227 --> 02:15:44.688]  Now they're forcing adoption of RFID in all products.
[02:15:45.108 --> 02:15:46.129]  See, it's a government op.
[02:15:47.630 --> 02:15:50.591]  The Army and Walmart, they're always together, are demanding this.
[02:15:51.312 --> 02:15:59.436]  The chief executive of the world's biggest retailer yesterday stepped up the pace in the race to be green with a series of initiatives to cut its own giant carbon footprint.
[02:15:59.836 --> 02:16:02.738]  But they moved most of their factories to China where there's no control.
[02:16:03.388 --> 02:16:05.410]  And those of its suppliers, customers, and staff.
[02:16:06.170 --> 02:16:07.271]  Just totally made up.
[02:16:08.532 --> 02:16:12.896]  Oh, we've all got to pay more tax and be regulated and be controlled and have less for the earth.
[02:16:14.197 --> 02:16:15.558]  It's neo-feudalism, folks.
[02:16:15.979 --> 02:16:18.000]  Global warming man-made will continue.
[02:16:18.020 --> 02:16:21.163]  I mean, this is the type of stuff I have here in front of me.
[02:16:23.525 --> 02:16:24.746]  And it's neo-feudalism.
[02:16:25.882 --> 02:16:31.326]  The global government has its excuse to regulate and control every facet, and the biggest news here is France tells the U.S.
[02:16:31.346 --> 02:16:33.427]  to sign climate PAC or face tax.
[02:16:33.688 --> 02:16:35.929]  President Jacques Chirac has demanded that the U.S.
[02:16:35.969 --> 02:16:41.533]  sign both the Kyoto Protocol and a future agreement that will take effect when Kyoto Accords runs out in 2012.
[02:16:41.974 --> 02:16:52.921]  He said he welcomes last week's State of the Union address in which President Bush described climate change as a serious challenge and acknowledged that a growing number of American politicians now favor emissions cuts, which is just an emissions tax.
[02:16:52.981 --> 02:16:53.602]  It's not cuts.
[02:16:54.258 --> 02:17:03.355]  But he warned if the United States did not sign the agreements, a carbon tax across Europe on imports from nations that have not signed the Kyoto Treaty could be imposed to try to force compliance.
[02:17:03.655 --> 02:17:06.461]  The European Union is the largest export market for American goods.
[02:17:07.077 --> 02:17:10.519]  A carbon tax is inevitable, so they just say you can't resist, it's going to happen.
[02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:12.440]  The board, you will be assimilated.
[02:17:13.041 --> 02:17:25.088]  If it is European, and I believe it will be European, then it will be all the same and have a certain influence because it means that all the countries that do not accept minimum obligations will be obliged to pay.
[02:17:25.729 --> 02:17:31.132]  You see, forcing us into global tax, leveraging the EU against the American Union.
[02:17:31.792 --> 02:17:32.573]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:32.613 --> 02:17:35.915]  We'll go straight into the speech, or straight into the question and answer.
[02:17:39.207 --> 02:17:39.867]  Hello, folks.

[02:18:27.338 --> 02:18:30.020]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:34.223]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:34.243 --> 02:18:36.345]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:36.385 --> 02:18:40.988]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:18:55.931 --> 02:19:00.535]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:01.455 --> 02:19:08.721]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:19:09.722 --> 02:19:12.784]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[02:19:12.844 --> 02:19:18.408]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[02:19:24.148 --> 02:19:29.972]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:19:30.613 --> 02:19:30.753]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.773 --> 02:19:31.073]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:39.412 --> 02:19:41.813]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:07.345 --> 02:20:08.866]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.

[02:20:13.810 --> 02:20:14.350]  It's free.
[02:20:14.450 --> 02:20:16.532]  Call now while operators are standing by to take your call.
[02:20:38.769 --> 02:20:40.514]  Shelley, you look exactly... Oh, wait.
[02:20:40.634 --> 02:20:41.676]  Why did you turn that down?
[02:20:42.125 --> 02:20:44.307]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[02:20:44.807 --> 02:20:49.311]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[02:20:49.471 --> 02:20:51.933]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[02:20:52.173 --> 02:20:53.374]  I could use something like that.
[02:20:53.474 --> 02:20:58.839]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night, and you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[02:20:58.879 --> 02:21:00.700]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:03.042]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[02:21:03.443 --> 02:21:04.063]  I guess you're right.
[02:21:04.443 --> 02:21:05.124]  Why don't we try it?
[02:21:05.304 --> 02:21:07.266]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[02:21:07.685 --> 02:21:12.088]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[02:21:12.388 --> 02:21:13.729]  I know where we can get some more information.
[02:21:14.169 --> 02:21:18.492]  Sleep disorder centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[02:21:18.732 --> 02:21:22.035]  The bed fan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.
[02:21:22.275 --> 02:21:25.417]  With our 30-day, 100% guarantee, you risk nothing.
[02:21:25.797 --> 02:21:26.658]  Are you a hot sleeper?
[02:21:26.878 --> 02:21:28.159]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[02:21:28.359 --> 02:21:29.640]  The bed fan is the answer.
[02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:33.182]  Visit us today at www.bedfan.com.
[02:21:33.522 --> 02:21:36.283]  That's www.bedfan.com.
[02:21:36.383 --> 02:21:38.343]  That's bedfan.com.
[02:21:40.104 --> 02:21:40.884]  All right, folks.
[02:21:41.504 --> 02:21:42.664]  We're back live here.
[02:21:42.864 --> 02:21:53.286]  Here's about 20 minutes or so from the 40 minutes or so of questions we took last night at the end of my speech at a packed house of almost 1,000 people.
[02:21:53.546 --> 02:21:54.387]  Well, 900 were there.
[02:21:54.467 --> 02:21:55.507]  100 got turned away at UT.
[02:21:56.684 --> 02:22:03.366]  I was going to play about 30 minutes of it, but now I learned Limbaugh talked about Bohemian Grove.
[02:22:03.506 --> 02:22:04.266]  I got mentioned.
[02:22:04.286 --> 02:22:07.987]  So we're going to play that in the last five minutes of the show today.
[02:22:08.367 --> 02:22:09.648]  So that's coming up.
[02:22:10.248 --> 02:22:10.828]  Stay with us.
[02:22:11.128 --> 02:22:11.948]  We'll be right back.
[02:22:12.008 --> 02:22:14.729]  Here is excerpts of the questions last night.
[02:22:16.602 --> 02:22:19.123]  Um, you've said two words here that I think are important.
[02:22:19.403 --> 02:22:22.024]  They are parasites, okay, and they're bullies, okay?
[02:22:22.044 --> 02:22:29.726]  And I think there's a perfect opportunity going on right now in America, because the last couple of weeks you've been on the radio, so I wonder what you think of this idea.
[02:22:29.746 --> 02:22:36.588]  There's a chance to put up a symbol to take down one of the biggest bullies, the biggest parasites in the world, the IRS, okay?
[02:22:36.789 --> 02:22:41.690]  When they form up and do another label around Ed Brown, what are 10,000 of us around them?
[02:22:41.710 --> 02:22:43.591]  Absolutely!
[02:22:45.745 --> 02:22:46.628]  We'll go up there.
[02:22:46.768 --> 02:22:47.831]  We'll go up in circles.
[02:22:47.851 --> 02:22:48.614]  I don't know where.
[02:22:48.654 --> 02:22:49.155]  We'll stop.
[02:22:49.737 --> 02:22:50.158]  Welding.
[02:22:50.820 --> 02:22:51.482]  And ground.
[02:22:53.086 --> 02:22:54.487]  The Federal Reserve is private.
[02:22:54.927 --> 02:22:56.468]  The income tax is paid to them.
[02:22:56.488 --> 02:22:59.110]  There's lots of constitutional taxes.
[02:22:59.210 --> 02:23:01.711]  Not one red cent of the income tax goes to private government.
[02:23:01.871 --> 02:23:06.414]  It's just like the private institutions merging with government institutions.
[02:23:06.494 --> 02:23:07.154]  It's incredible.
[02:23:07.855 --> 02:23:16.340]  When he's saying, we need to go ahead and start a Lexington or Concord, what will happen is if you go up to Edgar on A, which I'm trying to support, and people should go there up in New Hampshire,
[02:23:17.562 --> 02:23:19.808]  What they'll do is they'll just ignore him and move on.
[02:23:19.868 --> 02:23:23.718]  They don't want that confrontation showing that they're afraid of us.
[02:23:28.888 --> 02:23:32.749]  I want to commend y'all for what you're doing.
[02:23:33.049 --> 02:23:33.829]  I ran for U.S.
[02:23:33.889 --> 02:23:34.329]  Congress.
[02:23:34.529 --> 02:23:35.870]  My name is Grant Bostick.
[02:23:36.390 --> 02:23:37.650]  I was a grassroots candidate.
[02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:45.212]  And I can tell you that I learned firsthand how the media elites absolutely will stop a candidate.
[02:23:45.872 --> 02:23:47.653]  Now, I ran as a Republican.
[02:23:48.033 --> 02:23:51.293]  So I figured, well, at least the media will have to cover me just a little bit.
[02:23:51.373 --> 02:23:53.454]  Now, I'm a Liberty Republican and a Ron Paul Republican.
[02:23:54.054 --> 02:23:58.299]  But the media absolutely crushed and made silence my campaign.
[02:23:58.319 --> 02:24:00.562]  The national media hasn't mentioned Ron Paul.
[02:24:00.602 --> 02:24:01.063]  Exactly.
[02:24:01.463 --> 02:24:08.732]  That's why they're losing all their viewers, all their readers, and their dinosaurs, and they're just now starting to figure that out.
[02:24:08.792 --> 02:24:13.397]  So I think we ought to ignore them, just turn to them, and build the alternative media.
[02:24:19.713 --> 02:24:24.915]  This meeting has been great, and it has inspired people to do emails and do telephones.
[02:24:25.315 --> 02:24:42.360]  But if you'd like to get involved at a grassroots level here, in peacefully lobbying, this is the people in Austin, and our Congress people here, and our Senators, I formed an organization called the Liberty Bell, and you can look that up in Yahoo groups or Google groups and find out more about it.
[02:24:42.380 --> 02:24:42.900]  Fantastic.
[02:24:42.920 --> 02:24:44.061]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:24:45.782 --> 02:24:46.043]  Yes.
[02:25:06.218 --> 02:25:12.840]  My question is particularly directed toward Mr. Humphries who brought up the subject.
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:28.844]  Why do you think the Anglo-American elite are engaged in this very strange relationship with China in which on the one hand they're encouraging China to take over our economy and become stronger and stronger and stronger.
[02:25:29.204 --> 02:25:34.566]  At the same time they're kind of pulling the tiger by the tail and tweaking it at all times.
[02:25:35.266 --> 02:25:45.331]  Do you believe that they are arrogant enough to feel that eventually they will defeat China through military might?
[02:25:45.731 --> 02:25:49.273]  Or is it possible they're working together at some very, very deep level?
[02:25:49.293 --> 02:25:53.855]  No, that's really, you laid it out right there.
[02:25:53.875 --> 02:25:56.957]  Again, I have read this in books by scholars.
[02:25:56.977 --> 02:25:58.138]  I have confirmed it.
[02:25:58.798 --> 02:26:00.779]  But I've told this story many times already.
[02:26:00.839 --> 02:26:02.660]  I published it six, seven years ago now.
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:04.541]  I was watching the History Channel.
[02:26:06.012 --> 02:26:11.686]  And they had the former CIA section chief from 1949 in China.
[02:26:13.466 --> 02:26:21.431]  We thought Mao was a stabilizing, good influence, and we actually didn't support the Nationalists.
[02:26:21.631 --> 02:26:23.993]  We actually put Mao Zedong into power.
[02:26:24.413 --> 02:26:28.436]  Now, I don't already do that, but to see it on the History Channel was incredible.
[02:26:28.796 --> 02:26:36.721]  And the Communist Chinese admitted that Mao, under the Great Leap Forward Cultural Revolution, those two programs, 60 million people died.
[02:26:38.322 --> 02:26:40.424]  And then when Mao died in 1976,
[02:26:42.463 --> 02:26:56.850]  When I had this in my book, Set the Tyranny, but I had the actual New York Times article, David Rockefeller wrote an obituary about how wonderful communism is, and how wonderful Mao was, and how he was a stabilizing force.
[02:26:57.290 --> 02:26:58.631]  Now, look at me straight.
[02:26:58.651 --> 02:27:02.072]  I don't think there's some communist international conspiracy.
[02:27:02.493 --> 02:27:02.913]  Okay?
[02:27:04.034 --> 02:27:04.954]  We're on the march.
[02:27:04.994 --> 02:27:06.095]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:33.090 --> 02:27:35.792]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[02:27:52.995 --> 02:27:53.515]  We're good to go.
[02:28:11.488 --> 02:28:13.510]  That's The Nationalist Times, PO Box 426, Allison Park, PA 15101.

[02:28:39.048 --> 02:28:40.829]  Government is best which governs least.
[02:28:40.929 --> 02:28:42.230]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:28:42.411 --> 02:28:45.233]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:28:45.613 --> 02:28:48.335]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:28:48.906 --> 02:28:55.651]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:29:38.095 --> 02:29:42.137]  People who use Cardavite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:42.358 --> 02:29:45.759]  For over five years, Cardavite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:45.940 --> 02:29:49.442]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardavite.
[02:29:49.682 --> 02:29:52.884]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:29:52.904 --> 02:29:58.427]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:29:58.447 --> 02:30:04.050]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now
[02:30:04.470 --> 02:30:09.573]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:30:09.593 --> 02:30:15.036]  I mean, the idea of it working on the east end metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:30:15.496 --> 02:30:19.938]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:20.018 --> 02:30:21.319]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:21.527 --> 02:30:22.007]  We're good to go.
[02:30:22.047 --> 02:30:22.748]  We're good to go.
[02:30:42.423 --> 02:30:45.105]  I don't think there's some communist international conspiracy.
[02:30:45.805 --> 02:30:46.285]  Okay?
[02:30:46.946 --> 02:30:58.853]  But I do know that the big central bank, since Carroll Quigley wrote in 1969, that had a political science in Georgetown, Bill Clinton's mentor, who he thanked at his first State of the Union, he was one of the locals.
[02:30:58.893 --> 02:31:01.855]  He wrote a 900-some page book called Tragedy in O.
[02:31:03.007 --> 02:31:17.796]  And he said, the one world government round table groups that have their shadow government, CFR, Royal Institute of International Affairs in England, these are the real governments they put over each system, wants fascism, wants communism, wants anything centralized.
[02:31:18.977 --> 02:31:21.038]  You can't call these local corporations free market.
[02:31:21.238 --> 02:31:24.961]  They can lobby your government to give them concessions and pay their corporate welfare.
[02:31:25.521 --> 02:31:28.523]  And then they dance around and call themselves, what are we concerned with a free market?
[02:31:28.903 --> 02:31:29.724]  It is a free market.
[02:31:30.244 --> 02:31:31.585]  They want command and control.
[02:31:32.868 --> 02:31:43.291]  So the deal was really made back in the late 1940s for China to play the part of a boogeyman, to build itself up.
[02:31:43.331 --> 02:31:56.375]  It was like the Soviet Union the whole time, a home of plants owned by the Rockefellers, arm and hammer, giving them all the weapons, during Vietnam, shipping the weapons and the raw materials to Russia, who then shipped them to China and Vietnam.
[02:31:57.215 --> 02:31:57.996]  It's a business.
[02:31:59.356 --> 02:32:00.937]  This is part of the record.
[02:32:01.097 --> 02:32:02.297]  This is not my opinion.
[02:32:02.742 --> 02:32:03.783]  You go research this.
[02:32:04.503 --> 02:32:09.528]  And so what happened was, they went and they said, well, China, you're too backward.
[02:32:09.588 --> 02:32:18.014]  Build yourself up, get people off the land, destroy private property, get rid of the small middle class you have, then we'll talk.
[02:32:18.134 --> 02:32:22.018]  And China, 23 years later or so, really built itself up.
[02:32:22.498 --> 02:32:25.080]  So Nixon goes to China.
[02:32:25.100 --> 02:32:29.183]  Well, he already had Bush as the ambassador and the CIA director.
[02:32:29.844 --> 02:32:31.826]  And they set it up and they make a deal
[02:32:32.682 --> 02:32:36.844]  That select corporations will go there for neo-mercantilism.
[02:32:36.884 --> 02:32:37.985]  Look up mercantilism.
[02:32:38.625 --> 02:32:43.808]  This is where you can make these finished goods at prices so cheap you go and destroy your competition.
[02:32:44.489 --> 02:32:59.077]  Or to go to the more primitive type of mercantilism, it's where you take raw materials and you don't allow those subject nations to develop any finished goods or any durable goods and they ship that back to a central place like Paris or London
[02:32:59.457 --> 02:33:03.601]  To then be finished, and then you have to control because the industry is based there.
[02:33:03.882 --> 02:33:05.463]  This is kind of the reverse of that.
[02:33:05.623 --> 02:33:17.396]  You're destroying the middle class for independent industry for entrepreneurial programs in Western Europe, in the US, in Canada, and in even other areas of Asia that globalists don't control, or the Middle East.
[02:33:17.916 --> 02:33:28.861]  They go to China with a billion people, at that time 800 million, and they set up a program where they'll make the products to militarily, in an economic way, destroy our economy.
[02:33:29.321 --> 02:33:30.401]  And they've done that indeed.
[02:33:30.962 --> 02:33:33.683]  And so that's why China's been given all the weapons and built up.
[02:33:34.303 --> 02:33:46.188]  And that's how these bloc- China gets all the UN awards for the one-child policies, and the forced sterilizations, and the mobile execution bans, and the national ID cards, and the censored internet,
[02:33:46.843 --> 02:33:47.943]  This is their system.
[02:33:48.303 --> 02:33:49.584]  China is the model.
[02:33:49.884 --> 02:33:59.327]  Just like Dr. Pianka at UT said, we need a worldwide police state like China has so we can start getting rid of the people.
[02:34:00.727 --> 02:34:04.088]  Go read the text.
[02:34:04.108 --> 02:34:05.288]  This is what they're into.
[02:34:05.648 --> 02:34:07.869]  The globalists love China.
[02:34:08.089 --> 02:34:10.470]  A managed, controlled economy.
[02:34:10.810 --> 02:34:11.330]  Go ahead.
[02:34:12.651 --> 02:34:18.114]  I'm a freshman here at UT and I wonder if you have any advice for someone who wants to change the system.
[02:34:18.214 --> 02:34:23.857]  Is the best way to infiltrate it and change it or drop out and try to change it from the outside?
[02:34:24.297 --> 02:34:28.099]  You know, me and the system, reality system, I think both is important.
[02:34:28.199 --> 02:34:30.941]  I don't know your particular circumstances or what you're into.
[02:34:31.881 --> 02:34:36.304]  Life is so complex, you never know whether you can do more good in the system or outside the system.
[02:34:36.324 --> 02:34:37.485]  I would do both.
[02:34:37.885 --> 02:34:45.690]  Outside, I would start a website or a radio show or who knows what it is that your mind comes up with that you think should work.
[02:34:46.170 --> 02:34:47.311]  I like that true diversity.
[02:34:47.551 --> 02:34:51.414]  That can't be stopped, it can't be charted, it can't be controlled, it can't be contained.
[02:34:51.694 --> 02:34:54.596]  And then simultaneously, go work in the system if you want.
[02:34:55.670 --> 02:35:02.115]  Okay, and I also had an example of the UT business system that we've got going on at the business school.
[02:35:02.275 --> 02:35:12.882]  But I currently have a $500 library fine for 15 CDs, and they will not allow me to work it off for any way for the school because they say that it's through the system.
[02:35:13.002 --> 02:35:16.204]  Well, that's because the people that head up UT are on a revolving door.
[02:35:16.244 --> 02:35:21.167]  They've got to invest it in certain stocks so they can go be a chairman later and be paid off that way.
[02:35:21.888 --> 02:35:24.209]  They take your money, and none of it goes to the school.
[02:35:24.449 --> 02:35:25.030]  Total scam.
[02:35:25.671 --> 02:35:27.815]  They're just squeezing and squeezing and squeezing.
[02:35:28.136 --> 02:35:28.817]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:35:30.260 --> 02:35:32.144]  I've got a very classic question.
[02:35:33.309 --> 02:35:44.961]  When I say to people about the truth of 9-11 and the situation that we're living in today, a lot of people who respond will say, well, I'm not doing anything wrong.
[02:35:45.041 --> 02:35:47.563]  Why should I care that there's a GPS in my cell phone?
[02:35:47.583 --> 02:35:48.564]  I'm not doing anything wrong.
[02:35:48.644 --> 02:35:51.827]  Why should I care that there's a camera on every intersection stoplight?
[02:35:52.248 --> 02:35:53.529]  What do you say to people like that?
[02:35:53.729 --> 02:35:55.611]  How do you make them turn the corner?
[02:35:57.032 --> 02:35:58.393]  That's a really important question.
[02:35:58.493 --> 02:36:02.195]  I want people to say, so what if they're putting transponders in our inspection stickers?
[02:36:02.215 --> 02:36:04.657]  And so what if they've got GPS followings?
[02:36:04.677 --> 02:36:09.660]  And so what if all the cell phones by federal law track you and they can dial in and listen to you?
[02:36:09.700 --> 02:36:13.823]  And so what if Google's announcing they're going to use their built-in cameras and microphones to listen to you?
[02:36:14.223 --> 02:36:14.823]  And so what?
[02:36:14.843 --> 02:36:15.824]  What do I have to hide?
[02:36:16.857 --> 02:36:18.418]  It's not you that has to have to hide.
[02:36:18.819 --> 02:36:28.167]  It's the fact that throughout history, centralized groups are usually run by very sadistic, ruthless people who crave control.
[02:36:28.847 --> 02:36:33.932]  A normal person wants to have good friends, be happy, be successful, but at a certain point you get fat and happy.
[02:36:34.252 --> 02:36:36.273]  You're not going to stomp on people, screw people.
[02:36:36.593 --> 02:36:37.813]  You don't get into the fight.
[02:36:38.053 --> 02:36:41.534]  You don't get into the subterfuge of what it takes to climb the rooms.
[02:36:41.834 --> 02:36:53.158]  So it isn't survival of the fittest where the most evil and degenerate, cunning and slick get to the top of that pyramidal power structure and then we're all compartmentalized in it trying to get out.
[02:36:53.914 --> 02:36:58.895]  And so, you know, he raises the question of, you know, what do you say to people to stay out of the night?
[02:36:58.935 --> 02:37:04.337]  He explained to them that government is the most destructive and dangerous thing in history.
[02:37:04.997 --> 02:37:13.980]  Whether it be a phony religious government or a secular government, the point is government can do more harm to you than any individual thug or group of thugs.
[02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:20.163]  And it's better that ten guilty men go free, as they say, than one innocent go to prison.
[02:37:20.624 --> 02:37:25.166]  And we have a criminal elite posing as our government.
[02:37:25.507 --> 02:37:27.568]  They are destroying our regressive grievances.
[02:37:27.848 --> 02:37:29.669]  They are destroying our due process.
[02:37:29.929 --> 02:37:31.510]  They are annihilating our courts.
[02:37:31.930 --> 02:37:35.853]  And this awakening is taking place as part of a natural process.
[02:37:36.153 --> 02:37:39.515]  They're trying to use this high-tech control grid to suppress that.
[02:37:40.015 --> 02:37:41.496]  We've got about 15 minutes left.
[02:37:41.516 --> 02:37:43.698]  Let's rapid fire through the questions again.
[02:37:43.778 --> 02:37:53.107]  It's awesome to see all of you out here and to hear us rap right here.
[02:38:00.332 --> 02:38:00.632]  Sure.
[02:38:00.672 --> 02:38:02.634]  That's a complex issue.
[02:38:02.714 --> 02:38:02.874]  Look.
[02:38:02.954 --> 02:38:05.597]  You need to look at history as a process.
[02:38:24.662 --> 02:38:31.790]  Whereas, basically, 90% of people were slaves in every society throughout history.
[02:38:34.853 --> 02:38:42.300]  Ideas of liberty and freedom developed, say, with the Magna Carta in 1215 in England, where
[02:38:43.522 --> 02:38:49.207]  A developed middle class said, okay, these people can all be slaves, but we're not going to be.
[02:38:49.687 --> 02:38:57.073]  And so they got rules and laws written up where at least a larger portion of the population had liberty and freedom.
[02:38:57.293 --> 02:39:01.497]  And then others come along and say, you know what, I deserve that liberty and freedom.
[02:39:02.153 --> 02:39:08.698]  So you've got this pyramid where only the top has freedom, and so the Magna Carta, a bigger group, gets freedom.
[02:39:08.818 --> 02:39:11.240]  In 1776, a larger group takes freedom.
[02:39:11.580 --> 02:39:23.728]  And then you have black slaves and whites who were abolitionists in 1800, with only a few percent of the public being against it, saying this is wrong, and going out and revolutionizing the world and changing that.
[02:39:24.509 --> 02:39:29.332]  So, go study, you know, King George III,
[02:39:31.033 --> 02:39:34.814]  Versus the Founding Fathers, and these guys are heads above them.
[02:39:36.014 --> 02:39:44.937]  And you know, you look at the control-dominant media today, spending so much time demonizing Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, you have to ask yourselves why.
[02:39:45.257 --> 02:39:46.357]  Yes, they weren't perfect.
[02:39:46.818 --> 02:39:48.318]  Yes, they did a lot of bad things.
[02:39:48.898 --> 02:39:57.260]  The point is, the elites of Europe wrote books, gave speeches, saying it's horrible, they're getting freedom over there!
[02:39:57.280 --> 02:39:58.821]  This will spread!
[02:40:00.212 --> 02:40:01.157]  And it is spread!
[02:40:01.946 --> 02:40:06.970]  And then you've got black people 40, 50 years later saying, I'm not going to be a slave either.
[02:40:07.590 --> 02:40:12.654]  And you've got whites going, well look, the Constitution of the United States says this, all men are created equal.
[02:40:13.014 --> 02:40:14.835]  The point is, the documents are beautiful.
[02:40:15.396 --> 02:40:16.056]  The system.
[02:40:16.076 --> 02:40:30.647]  I mean, these guys speak three or four languages, they study history, and they were thinking about how to tie government's hands, tie the hands of the king and his governors, so they could engage in commerce and become wealthy.
[02:40:31.860 --> 02:40:34.481]  So they were doing it greedily for themselves.
[02:40:35.157 --> 02:40:45.925]  But they created a system that let 4% of the world's population, that's the American people, have half the wealth, and we became decadent and wicked because of it.
[02:40:46.265 --> 02:40:57.674]  But the point is that the establishment hated what's been set up here, and George Bush and Bill Clinton and all of them have done everything they can to abolish the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:40:58.014 --> 02:41:02.378]  So even if you hate George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and Sam Adams,
[02:41:03.078 --> 02:41:07.517]  You should love that Bill of Rights and Constitution because it's something that so many
[02:41:16.633 --> 02:41:20.676]  Yeah, I guess I just want to kind of maybe like play devil's advocate for a second.
[02:41:20.736 --> 02:41:22.877]  It's probably about to get really unpopular.
[02:41:23.117 --> 02:41:28.101]  I'm just curious, what exactly, like, what exactly do you propose?
[02:41:28.121 --> 02:41:31.283]  Do you want to, I guess, not have the government in place?
[02:41:31.363 --> 02:41:33.444]  I think governments are probably, on the whole, evil.
[02:41:33.544 --> 02:41:37.347]  Like, every government throughout history has killed thousands and thousands of people.
[02:41:37.367 --> 02:41:38.468]  That's how they function.
[02:41:38.488 --> 02:41:40.869]  But, like, what are you proposing instead?
[02:41:40.930 --> 02:41:42.170]  Like, I don't get it.
[02:41:42.190 --> 02:41:42.731]  I mean, like...
[02:41:43.451 --> 02:41:53.136]  I'm proposing a constitutional society, a liberty culture, getting back to the more nobler and better aspects of humankind.
[02:41:53.216 --> 02:42:00.039]  I'm proposing not being cynical and having an aggressive attitude to defend our liberties and defend other people's liberties.
[02:42:00.519 --> 02:42:05.220]  Because a lot of youngies and individuals think that if you don't care about anybody else, you get a headline.
[02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:10.601]  Actually, when nobody cares about each other, you end up in a destructive climate where the predators can pick us off one by one.
[02:42:10.661 --> 02:42:11.422]  We stand together.
[02:42:11.442 --> 02:42:12.622]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:42:12.642 --> 02:42:17.663]  I'm proposing getting back to those rights and constitutions.
[02:42:18.283 --> 02:42:26.145]  I'm proposing hunting down war criminals and arresting George Floyd and getting back...
[02:42:37.296 --> 02:42:55.140]  I'm proposing the grand jury call for the indictment!
[02:43:20.586 --> 02:43:29.793]  It's cool, like, I don't know, like... I guess, like, the Illuminati tonight, like, the top tier of...
[02:43:30.393 --> 02:43:36.638]  The Illuminati is owned in the name of a 235-year-old private intelligence agency.
[02:43:36.878 --> 02:43:40.140]  That's all secret societies are.
[02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:43.663]  Pre-1900, they were called secret services or secret societies.
[02:43:43.763 --> 02:43:47.305]  Our secret service still has the old name for the president.
[02:43:47.445 --> 02:43:51.649]  But secret societies are nothing more than intelligence agencies.
[02:43:52.589 --> 02:43:57.732]  Yes, the majority of the taxes are paid to them, to the elites.
[02:43:58.192 --> 02:44:02.494]  They literally just suck off everything.
[02:44:02.915 --> 02:44:05.316]  They're not free market, they're mafia.
[02:44:05.616 --> 02:44:09.578]  I'm for going after the global mafia.
[02:44:09.678 --> 02:44:12.920]  The global mafia has taken over our society.
[02:44:19.023 --> 02:44:29.075]  And it's driving us out of a police state to neutralize resistance they know would have borne and is forming at a greater level than they ever expected!
[02:44:37.446 --> 02:44:41.469]  I've got a problem with that.
[02:44:41.669 --> 02:44:44.892]  I'm very encouraged to hear Jack Black and yourself, Alex.
[02:44:45.552 --> 02:44:50.256]  When I look at this, I don't look at this as a partisan issue.
[02:44:51.397 --> 02:44:53.699]  There are Democrats that would be on your side.
[02:44:53.719 --> 02:44:55.080]  There are Republicans on your side.
[02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:56.381]  This is not partisan.
[02:44:56.401 --> 02:44:58.302]  This is about humanity.
[02:44:58.322 --> 02:45:05.127]  And I think our job as a citizen is to get the truth and to figure out how we can do that.
[02:45:06.839 --> 02:45:14.342]  My question for you, Alex, and don't answer just yet, but my question for everyone, too, is what is the criteria for really getting to what the evil person is?
[02:45:14.523 --> 02:45:18.424]  And this would be my suggestion and my hypothesis on this.
[02:45:18.504 --> 02:45:19.165]  There are two things.
[02:45:19.285 --> 02:45:21.105]  One is the love of money.
[02:45:21.185 --> 02:45:23.346]  When there's a true love of money.
[02:45:23.506 --> 02:45:24.347]  The Bible says that.
[02:45:24.647 --> 02:45:27.068]  When there's a love of money, it gets you stashed.
[02:45:27.348 --> 02:45:31.570]  That love of status and love of money, and also, number two, the addiction to winning.
[02:45:31.830 --> 02:45:33.631]  These people have such an addiction to winning.
[02:45:33.711 --> 02:45:44.777]  I just want to be careful about generalizing and say that, you know what, all people at home that are on top of a corporation are bad, all Democrats are bad, all Republicans are bad, whatever it is, I think you're going to find good people throughout all different facets.
[02:45:44.857 --> 02:45:50.419]  I'm glad you brought up the nature of it, because that's really important.
[02:45:50.439 --> 02:45:51.320]  To me, evil
[02:45:53.087 --> 02:46:00.921]  It's the willingness to hurt someone innocent who hasn't done anything to you so you can get ahead.
[02:46:08.835 --> 02:46:20.640]  When somebody does something bad to you and is trying to hurt you, not to go after vengeance, but if you don't stand up for yourself and for others, then that's evil as well.
[02:46:20.660 --> 02:46:24.802]  That is corrupt, sluggish, and weedy, and it's a bad thing.
[02:46:25.002 --> 02:46:32.205]  But true evil is trying to dumb down and mutate and hurt people just so they're more easy to manage.
[02:46:32.365 --> 02:46:35.807]  And it's about setting up societies where there aren't opportunities
[02:46:36.707 --> 02:46:40.769]  Just so you can control them and have sway over them.
[02:46:40.789 --> 02:46:41.829]  To me, that is pure evil.
[02:46:42.269 --> 02:46:53.473]  Pure evil is just cynically, you know, a new government forms in some African nation that's really helping their people, but it cuts into your monopoly of some type of mineral.
[02:46:53.493 --> 02:47:01.076]  So you go in and overthrow them, put a thug in, just so the thug will oppress the population and keep giving you the raw materials.
[02:47:01.596 --> 02:47:02.617]  Alright.
[02:47:02.637 --> 02:47:03.558]  Okay, folks.
[02:47:27.577 --> 02:47:28.497]  That's all I'm going to play today.
[02:47:28.557 --> 02:47:33.819]  Monday I'll play the last ten minutes of it because I just learned, it just went up, there is a clip of Rush Limbaugh.
[02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:47.764]  There is a clip of Rush Limbaugh when John Connor calls in and brings up Bohemian Grove, making a joke about it, but then admitting that he actually knows every facet of it and then poo-pooing it.
[02:47:48.004 --> 02:47:49.325]  And he's lying up there.
[02:47:50.326 --> 02:47:53.469]  And the way he behaves, I think he's been there.
[02:47:54.049 --> 02:47:57.632]  And John Connor put some great images from some of my films to the video.
[02:47:57.672 --> 02:48:04.517]  It's going up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[02:48:04.577 --> 02:48:06.218]  Paul Lawson's going to write an article about it.
[02:48:07.239 --> 02:48:18.327]  So when we come back, out of break, we'll play this four-minute clip concerning the bizarre behaviors of the elite Skull & Bones Bohemian Grove, Rush Limbaugh,
[02:48:19.361 --> 02:48:23.585]  And then we will wrap up this Friday edition, and I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:48:24.085 --> 02:48:28.429]  Central Time, out of the studios of NewsRadio 590-KLBJ.
[02:48:29.470 --> 02:48:33.153]  And we'll basically leave it at that.
[02:48:33.713 --> 02:48:36.836]  All right, Rush Limbaugh talking about Bohemian Grove straight ahead.
[02:48:42.216 --> 02:48:45.380]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:47.662]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:48.063 --> 02:48:55.691]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:56.385 --> 02:49:03.449]  TerrorStorm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:03.849 --> 02:49:15.256]  TerrorStorm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:15.576 --> 02:49:19.498]  TerrorStorm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:19.538 --> 02:49:21.499]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:21.800 --> 02:49:25.582]  TerrorStorm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:11.276 --> 02:50:14.778]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[02:51:57.552 --> 02:52:01.757]  Limbaugh also claims that they don't even urinate on trees at the Grove, which I've witnessed.
[02:52:02.097 --> 02:52:05.020]  But he takes the most petty issue and then even denies that.
[02:52:05.341 --> 02:52:10.226]  Here it is, John Connor, ResistantsManifesto.com, calling in to Lord Limbaugh, being very effective.
[02:52:10.386 --> 02:52:10.826]  Here it is.
[02:52:11.247 --> 02:52:13.710]  John in San Diego, you're next on the EIB Network.
[02:52:13.730 --> 02:52:13.890]  Hello.
[02:52:14.637 --> 02:52:23.000]  Since I had you on the line, Rush, have you seen the video of the Bohemian Grove ceremony that Alex Jones produced that's on Google Video?
[02:52:24.081 --> 02:52:27.402]  No, I've been invited to Bohemian Grove, but I've never been there.
[02:52:27.842 --> 02:52:29.223]  And I've not seen the video.
[02:52:29.643 --> 02:52:32.204]  Do you know about the activities within the Grove?
[02:52:32.224 --> 02:52:33.144]  Can you talk about that?
[02:52:33.344 --> 02:52:37.906]  No, because I've never been there.
[02:52:38.186 --> 02:52:40.687]  All I know is that it's a bunch of elitists.
[02:52:41.875 --> 02:52:46.538]  And power brokers, who conduct secret meetings to take over the world, and they run around nude.
[02:52:46.978 --> 02:52:48.699]  It's all men, no women are allowed.
[02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:55.023]  And they run around, and you can find them going to the bathroom on the side of trees and so forth, and they have people come out and make speeches to them and all that.
[02:52:56.224 --> 02:53:08.432]  And I know it was started by members of the San Francisco Symphony, way, way, way back, who were shunned from San Francisco society, so they formed their own little club there, up in Northern California.
[02:53:13.782 --> 02:53:15.743]  Where do you find these people?
[02:53:17.964 --> 02:53:19.364]  Have you ever heard of the Bohemian Grove?
[02:53:19.944 --> 02:53:20.564]  Oh, you haven't?
[02:53:22.025 --> 02:53:25.266]  He believes the Bohemian Grove is the CFR in the woods.
[02:53:26.736 --> 02:53:35.745]  The Bohemian Grove was started by members of the San Francisco Symphony or some orchestra way, way back, many, many, many years ago, shunned by San Francisco society.
[02:53:36.106 --> 02:53:36.946]  They have camps.
[02:53:37.387 --> 02:53:41.171]  It goes on for three or four weeks up in the Russian River area of Northern California.
[02:53:42.098 --> 02:53:44.901]  And there are members from all over the world, and they can take guests.
[02:53:45.261 --> 02:53:47.002]  There are people that come out and speak to them.
[02:53:47.443 --> 02:53:48.724]  It's rustic living.
[02:53:49.925 --> 02:53:51.005]  It's great food.
[02:53:51.066 --> 02:53:52.427]  It's great cooking.
[02:53:52.487 --> 02:54:03.856]  But people believe that it is nothing more than a secret meeting of world conspiracists who are out to take over the world's money supply and all these other things.
[02:54:05.520 --> 02:54:09.981]  I've been asked to speak at the Bohemian Grove, and I'll guarantee you this.
[02:54:10.421 --> 02:54:13.362]  Who was this guy's name?
[02:54:14.002 --> 02:54:14.282]  John?
[02:54:14.302 --> 02:54:17.903]  John in San Diego.
[02:54:18.003 --> 02:54:30.565]  John, I guarantee you, if the Bohemian Grove is what you think it is, I would never have been invited there as many times, nor would I have been invited to go out and make... Some of my best golf buddies are members of the place, and they go out there and do it.
[02:54:30.645 --> 02:54:31.866]  It's just a social thing.
[02:54:32.066 --> 02:54:32.866]  It's just a pure...
[02:54:33.704 --> 02:54:36.946]  Social thing, and they do bring in entertainment and speakers.
[02:54:39.348 --> 02:54:42.850]  And it's rustic living out on the Russian River.
[02:54:43.151 --> 02:54:49.055]  And everybody has these fearful conspiracies and theories about it.
[02:54:50.255 --> 02:54:59.682]  One of the myths that always goes around about the Bohemian Grove is that if you do go, since it's all men, you can walk around nude if you want.
[02:54:59.702 --> 02:55:01.083]  You don't have to get dressed or any of that.
[02:55:01.103 --> 02:55:02.684]  You might even see George Shultz
[02:55:03.816 --> 02:55:05.297]  Relieving himself on the side of a tree.
[02:55:06.358 --> 02:55:11.922]  So one night, some years ago, I was invited to a dinner in Washington of the American Spectator.
[02:55:13.003 --> 02:55:15.785]  Bob Terrell's fantastic, fabulous magazine and website.
[02:55:15.825 --> 02:55:19.128]  I was seated next to the former Treasury Secretary, the late, great William Simon.
[02:55:19.968 --> 02:55:21.810]  And he said, you've got to get out to the Grove.
[02:55:22.290 --> 02:55:24.752]  And I said, you know, I probably had a sense of humor.
[02:55:24.792 --> 02:55:30.696]  I said, I'd love to get out there because I would love to see George Shultz relieving himself on the side of a tree.
[02:55:30.796 --> 02:55:31.737]  And he looked...
[02:55:32.566 --> 02:55:34.147]  Who told you that?
[02:55:34.407 --> 02:55:34.707]  Why?
[02:55:35.027 --> 02:55:38.908]  That would never... I can't believe it!
[02:55:39.208 --> 02:55:49.412]  I'm shrinking in my seat, because I thought he'd understand the humor, because I thought this was something everybody... And he was profoundly offended that that's what the reputation of growth was.
[02:55:49.752 --> 02:55:51.613]  And I'm talking about George Shultz, the former secretary.
[02:55:52.012 --> 02:55:53.433]  All right, have a great weekend.
[02:55:53.473 --> 02:55:54.094]  God bless you all.
[02:56:18.712 --> 02:56:19.173]  We're good.
