[00:00:04.191 --> 00:00:04.851]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.492 --> 00:00:06.592]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:08.373]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.034 --> 00:00:09.854]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:12.115]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.155 --> 00:00:16.017]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.357 --> 00:00:20.439]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.871]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:32.091]  Welcome.
[00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:32.991]  It is the fourth day of October 2007.
[00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:34.512]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:34.532 --> 00:00:35.213]  We have no guests today.
[00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:38.895]  I have wiped the slate clean so that we have time to cover the news and take your phone calls.
[00:01:01.508 --> 00:01:03.168]  Headline, Secret U.S.
[00:01:03.268 --> 00:01:06.849]  Endorsement of Severe Interrogations.
[00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.310]  That means burning people, waterboarding them, pliers, drills.
[00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:15.011]  That's in the handbooks.
[00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:31.094]  Remember, Abu Ghraib is just one of hundreds of these sites, more than 30 in Iraq, black sites all over the world, where a special breed of sicko
[00:01:33.584 --> 00:01:43.007]  Is being forged to be turned loose on the American people, who are the main target of all of this barbarism and ultra-evil.
[00:01:45.748 --> 00:01:47.488]  I don't think this is big news today.
[00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:50.969]  They're freaking out all over television, freaking out all over radio.
[00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.131]  The President signed an order saying torture people.
[00:01:56.951 --> 00:02:00.452]  What do you think his Chief Counsel's memos were to the Pentagon?
[00:02:01.474 --> 00:02:03.595]  What do you think John Hughes memos were?
[00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:12.117]  I've seen Rumsfeld when he was Defense Secretary on television saying they were torturing people.
[00:02:13.797 --> 00:02:19.018]  Do you just think they secretly arrested people all over the world and took them to torture camps?
[00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.239]  To give them pedicures?
[00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.660]  But that's the American people, you just tell them.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.241]  Yeah, the Army Report says they rape people in front of their
[00:02:31.272 --> 00:02:33.033]  Mothers and fathers and husbands.
[00:02:34.794 --> 00:02:37.496]  And yeah, they do satanic rituals with blood.
[00:02:38.036 --> 00:02:38.877]  That's come out.
[00:02:39.217 --> 00:02:42.499]  They say to freak them out at Camp X-Ray.
[00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:46.141]  I can't say on air.
[00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:47.362]  It's sexual blood rituals.
[00:02:47.402 --> 00:02:48.242]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:02:50.964 --> 00:02:53.546]  And don't email me saying, I want to see your proof.
[00:02:53.686 --> 00:02:57.548]  Hey lazy, if you don't know how to Google and search and find out about
[00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:03.523]  The torture at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo, I'm not, I mean I've covered it many times.
[00:03:03.904 --> 00:03:05.224]  So don't just say it's not true.
[00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:13.366]  I go through message boards, I go through posting areas, I've got good links and documents and news stories.
[00:03:15.047 --> 00:03:16.627]  But I also see a lot of the detritus.
[00:03:18.067 --> 00:03:25.810]  And there are people out there saying that there's no army report, the Togumbo report, that says that they rape people.
[00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.930]  They just say it's not true.
[00:03:28.462 --> 00:03:43.182]  Or neocons get up on air and say I made up that Oregon law with Senator Menace, no pun intended, that's his name, that almost passed that said if you download music live in prison for 25 years in a forest work camp,
[00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:52.933]  It says, in a work camp, and then they take some hour-long rant and have me call it a labor camp, that is what a work camp is, work, labor, same thing.
[00:03:53.273 --> 00:03:56.175]  They go, he's lying, it's a work camp, not a labor camp.
[00:03:56.515 --> 00:03:59.296]  See, that's the type of games they play.
[00:04:00.577 --> 00:04:02.177]  Anything to weasel around.
[00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:13.663]  They're on the web saying the dollar's strong, and that it's an Al-Qaeda sympathizing lie to say that it's being destroyed.
[00:04:16.258 --> 00:04:18.860]  And it is a wanton, willful ignorance.
[00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:22.383]  A wanton, willful love of corruption.
[00:04:24.945 --> 00:04:29.648]  By the way, they tried to censor our story yesterday on Digg, the Digg Berry Brigade.
[00:04:31.329 --> 00:04:32.130]  Tried to stop it.
[00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.151]  It didn't work.
[00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:36.273]  It has thousands upon thousands now of Diggs.
[00:04:37.774 --> 00:04:38.995]  We beat the Berry Brigade.
[00:04:39.015 --> 00:04:42.258]  And I commend everybody out there for doing that.
[00:04:42.278 --> 00:04:43.098]  We beat them last week.
[00:04:43.118 --> 00:04:43.799]  We beat them this week.
[00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:47.568]  And hundreds of thousands of people have seen the truth.
[00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.933]  So we'll give you Part 2 in the development of the Veteran Removing Illegal Mexican Flag.
[00:04:54.734 --> 00:04:55.735]  May be charged.
[00:04:56.335 --> 00:04:56.796]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:04.348]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:05:04.408 --> 00:05:11.730]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:22.533]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:05:22.714 --> 00:05:27.255]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:32.521]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[00:05:32.742 --> 00:05:35.665]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:45.657]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black murky elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:05:45.777 --> 00:05:50.642]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.690]  It's here!
[00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.713]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:08.073 --> 00:06:15.737]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:23.441]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:30.005]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:06:31.238 --> 00:06:35.260]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:35.581 --> 00:06:39.183]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:39.543 --> 00:06:41.724]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:41.764 --> 00:06:45.567]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.703]  Where do you think one of the most toxic places on earth is?
[00:07:01.983 --> 00:07:03.224]  The answer may surprise you.
[00:07:03.404 --> 00:07:04.385]  It's in your body.
[00:07:04.645 --> 00:07:08.489]  The colon is a natural breeding ground for disease-producing germs.
[00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:12.873]  It may not sound like a very appealing subject, but it should not go ignored.
[00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:16.296]  For over a decade now, natural health expert Dr. Lauren Ritter
[00:07:16.576 --> 00:07:20.220]  That's educated people everywhere about the benefits of internal cleansing.
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:27.266]  Now these benefits include higher energy levels, more comfortable digestion, high immune support, and healthier looking skin.
[00:07:27.566 --> 00:07:32.171]  Now you can try Dr. Ritter's Colon Cleansing Program from the privacy of your own home.
[00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:36.855]  It's safe and natural and it gently cleanses the entire digestive tract.
[00:07:37.055 --> 00:07:39.698]  Don't let your body be the most toxic place on earth.
[00:07:40.038 --> 00:07:42.899]  Take care of your health by cleansing your colon and body.
[00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:43.099]  Dial 1-800-890-2014.
[00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:43.320]  That's 1-800-890-2014.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.321]  Call now to find out how you can get the colon and body cleanse risk-free for 30 days.
[00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:46.501]  Dial 1-800-890-2014.
[00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:46.701]  Call now.
[00:07:59.088 --> 00:08:04.110]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.810]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:15.353 --> 00:08:19.534]  The Pentagon has arrested scores of people.
[00:08:19.554 --> 00:08:21.375]  I know it's more than 30.
[00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:27.297]  They have sent quite a few to prison for many years.
[00:08:29.568 --> 00:08:30.969]  For torturing people!
[00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:35.213]  Now, there's multiple layers to the spin in this.
[00:08:36.314 --> 00:08:43.240]  CBS Broadcast Center in Manhattan, going back more than 50 years, is still the core propaganda bureau.
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:49.565]  ABC, CBS, and Fox are all produced out of there.
[00:08:49.645 --> 00:08:51.987]  It's the news gathering center.
[00:08:53.286 --> 00:08:59.547]  And then all over the country, they then send out the little packaged news feeds via satellite, and now T1.
[00:09:01.468 --> 00:09:08.289]  And then your local reporters read the teleprompter over the video to give it local flair, local taste.
[00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:15.470]  So that's a big part of the military-industrial combines system of information control.
[00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.751]  That's a very large part of it.
[00:09:20.584 --> 00:09:45.191]  And when CBS released people in pyramids naked, and people being beaten, and even a dog growling and snapping at them, I instinctively, and it turned out to be exactly the case, said, you know what, it's going to be a lot worse than that, because they admit there's thousands of photos and videos, and this is what was, quote, leaked to
[00:09:46.412 --> 00:09:57.478]  CBS and compared to and then the Army report came out and it was hundreds of times worse what indeed was than what was in those photos.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:05.402]  But now neocons go, oh some naked people in a pile.
[00:10:06.603 --> 00:10:10.585]  Oh, the troops were just blowing off steam.
[00:10:11.346 --> 00:10:13.447]  They were just having a good time.
[00:10:13.547 --> 00:10:15.568]  Don't you ever need to just blow off some steam?
[00:10:16.323 --> 00:10:18.204]  In fact, I haven't played that in about two years.
[00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:19.985]  Can you dig that out of computer?
[00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:22.887]  Limbossing or just having fun blowing off steam?
[00:10:24.348 --> 00:10:24.648]  Thanks.
[00:10:25.128 --> 00:10:29.611]  And if it sounds like I'm drunk today, my allergies have hit me.
[00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:35.975]  Please don't call with allergy remedies.
[00:10:36.095 --> 00:10:37.576]  Please don't call.
[00:10:37.676 --> 00:10:39.517]  I don't want to sound like a hypochondriac.
[00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:42.919]  I just know people are going to notice.
[00:10:44.498 --> 00:10:47.700]  And that I'm kind of stumbling about a bit.
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.060]  I'm going to get going here in a minute.
[00:10:50.841 --> 00:10:53.703]  And I just didn't want you to speculate.
[00:10:55.343 --> 00:10:56.844]  And think, oh, he's depressed.
[00:10:56.924 --> 00:10:59.686]  Last time I had an allergy a few months ago was, are you depressed?
[00:10:59.726 --> 00:11:00.426]  You sound down.
[00:11:01.046 --> 00:11:07.269]  No, I just feel like somebody's got a balloon in my sinus pumping it up with a bicycle pump.
[00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.950]  That's all.
[00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:09.790]  That's all.
[00:11:10.851 --> 00:11:12.792]  Here is Rush Limbaugh.
[00:11:15.618 --> 00:11:17.219]  There's nothing psychologically wrong with that.
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.741]  It's not the act so much.
[00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:24.806]  It was like a college fraternity prank to stack up naked... Exactly!
[00:11:25.527 --> 00:11:27.148]  Exactly my point!
[00:11:27.468 --> 00:11:38.298]  This is no different than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives with it, and we're going to hurt their own military with it, and then we're going to really hammer them because they had a good time.
[00:11:41.417 --> 00:11:43.499]  These people are being fired at every day.
[00:11:43.579 --> 00:11:45.040]  I'm talking about the people having a good time.
[00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:47.823]  These people... You ever heard of emotional release?
[00:11:48.884 --> 00:11:50.826]  You ever heard of nudiblosis, Phenolph?
[00:11:53.769 --> 00:11:59.414]  Now, at the time he said that, it had been out for many months.
[00:11:59.854 --> 00:12:07.261]  It had been all over the news that they were raping them with large objects dripping with battery acid.
[00:12:10.026 --> 00:12:11.187]  It's in the Army Report.
[00:12:12.167 --> 00:12:15.049]  That they were raping women in front of their husbands.
[00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.231]  That they were brutalizing children.
[00:12:21.392 --> 00:12:35.641]  Now, everybody gets up in a tizzy when some degenerate killer grabs some four-year-old out of a backyard, takes him to some shack, rapes him for five days, and then slits their throat and buries them in a shallow grave.
[00:12:37.602 --> 00:12:38.202]  That's normal.
[00:12:39.597 --> 00:12:40.557]  To get upset about that.
[00:12:40.617 --> 00:12:41.898]  You should get upset about that.
[00:12:42.258 --> 00:12:44.499]  You should feel threatened by people like that.
[00:12:44.899 --> 00:12:49.741]  You should feel hatred for them and a wanton desire to crush their skulls.
[00:12:51.361 --> 00:12:56.463]  Because when you let evil like that run wild, it only grows and feeds on our innocence.
[00:12:57.423 --> 00:13:02.625]  It is a normal mammalian instinct to want to attack those that try to attack your tribe.
[00:13:02.645 --> 00:13:06.967]  And the instinct to defend is even greater.
[00:13:08.078 --> 00:13:12.981]  When that attack is against innocents, or the defenseless of our species.
[00:13:14.722 --> 00:13:35.273]  And to have all these TV shows, all these movies, all these talk show hosts, all these different politicians, for the last six years, telling us torture is good, and to have official White House memos saying we can beat someone till they die, and if we didn't mean to kill them, it's not even torture to kill them.
[00:13:36.431 --> 00:13:41.757]  I mean, beating someone to death is torture of the most extreme type.
[00:13:43.059 --> 00:13:53.170]  But according to White House memos, and remember, Karl Roves told the White House press corps when they were at a cocktail party, he told a whole gaggle of them,
[00:13:54.233 --> 00:14:07.178]  Washington Post, New York Times reporters, that we control reality, we can say one thing today, something completely opposite tomorrow, and you will go along with it, because you are history's spectators, we are history's actors.
[00:14:08.758 --> 00:14:13.380]  And so they stand up, and quite frankly, with most of the general public, it's actually true.
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:20.122]  You can tell them that a Shiite is a Sunni, that Iran is Al-Qaeda, when that is a complete lie.
[00:14:21.002 --> 00:14:23.003]  Ten seconds of research will verify that.
[00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:31.383]  That's like saying Hulk Hogan is Andre the Giant, or that Count Dracula is Snoopy.
[00:14:32.824 --> 00:14:34.745]  It's two separate things.
[00:14:35.365 --> 00:14:37.527]  Two separate creatures.
[00:14:38.708 --> 00:14:43.631]  It's like saying red is blue, that black is white, that up is down, that left is right.
[00:14:44.131 --> 00:14:46.493]  It is a ball face on its face line.
[00:14:47.233 --> 00:14:47.933]  It doesn't matter.
[00:14:47.953 --> 00:14:49.934]  I watched a video of a D.C.
[00:14:49.994 --> 00:14:51.255]  pro-war rally with Iran.
[00:14:51.295 --> 00:14:52.956]  As they said, Iran is al-Qaeda.
[00:14:53.316 --> 00:14:54.176]  It's fronting al-Qaeda.
[00:14:54.196 --> 00:14:56.717]  We must go to Iran to get the WMDs and al-Qaeda.
[00:14:57.398 --> 00:14:59.118]  And the public just cheered mindlessly.
[00:14:59.618 --> 00:15:01.079]  They all had their short haircuts.
[00:15:01.119 --> 00:15:02.600]  They're all conservatives.
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.481]  They're all, oh yeah, they're good.
[00:15:05.981 --> 00:15:08.122]  They understand what America needs.
[00:15:09.003 --> 00:15:14.385]  They don't do anything about the BATF expanding, the gun control, the open borders, the destruction of the dollar.
[00:15:15.129 --> 00:15:18.150]  They don't care if there's gay porn stars in the White House every night.
[00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.031]  They don't care if it's going on a bohemian grove.
[00:15:21.071 --> 00:15:22.812]  They don't care if governments exploded in size.
[00:15:23.152 --> 00:15:25.393]  They just want to feel good and have short haircuts.
[00:15:25.953 --> 00:15:29.094]  And talk about killing somebody in a country they can't find on a map.
[00:15:31.155 --> 00:15:36.277]  And that's why they can write a memo saying, we can torture somebody until they die and it's not torture.
[00:15:36.377 --> 00:15:40.198]  We can't torture small children with pliers sexually.
[00:15:42.481 --> 00:15:46.985]  And I talk a lot about this when Torker's in the news, because, I mean, this is how far we've fallen!
[00:15:47.005 --> 00:15:48.586]  There's not much further to fall!
[00:15:50.207 --> 00:16:08.082]  And then, it turns out they're torturing people to death at an airbase, there in Afghanistan, but the one in Kabul, in the one particular case, or Kabul, and
[00:16:12.799 --> 00:16:14.500]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.520]  It's unspeakable.
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.501]  They're torturing people to death, and then it gets out.
[00:16:18.541 --> 00:16:22.203]  They decide to burn the head contractor who's over the torture team.
[00:16:22.223 --> 00:16:25.564]  I mean, what do you think when you're a torturer?
[00:16:25.584 --> 00:16:27.545]  You think your masters are going to be sweet to you?
[00:16:28.425 --> 00:16:33.047]  They always kill the torturers, or enslave the torturers, or imprison the torturers later.
[00:16:33.728 --> 00:16:35.288]  That's how the game's played, dummy.
[00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:38.490]  So he said, hey, I was ordered to do it.
[00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.490]  I've got my orders.
[00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:41.211]  This is when he was out on bail.
[00:16:42.449 --> 00:16:48.232]  They grabbed him, charged him under Patriot Act, and that was almost three years ago.
[00:16:48.252 --> 00:16:49.912]  He's never been seen since.
[00:16:51.293 --> 00:16:52.454]  And he's a white guy.
[00:16:53.614 --> 00:16:55.115]  And you'll never see him again.
[00:16:56.195 --> 00:16:58.316]  That guy is in a black sight.
[00:16:59.317 --> 00:17:03.939]  And if they ever let him go, he'll just be a grueling catatonic mess.
[00:17:07.921 --> 00:17:09.501]  Because they don't care if it's one of their own.
[00:17:09.541 --> 00:17:10.582]  They like to torture.
[00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:14.605]  Can you imagine him after those people he tortured to death?
[00:17:16.306 --> 00:17:18.867]  Under orders, and now he's in the hands of others?
[00:17:19.468 --> 00:17:23.870]  No news articles, no updates, I've searched his name, he's gone!
[00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:24.830]  U.S.
[00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:29.832]  citizen, carrying out death torture, murder torture, hardcore!
[00:17:31.853 --> 00:17:33.054]  Homicidal killing!
[00:17:35.703 --> 00:17:36.824]  Torture Chamber stuff.
[00:17:37.244 --> 00:17:43.489]  I remember one of the number one video games, it was a review for it in what, PC World or something, in 99.
[00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:44.650]  I made a big deal out of it.
[00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.411]  It was called Dungeon Keeper.
[00:17:48.633 --> 00:17:55.879]  And I just so happened to be, I think I was getting a haircut, doesn't matter, I picked up the magazine and I opened it up and it was a great review for Dungeon Keeper.
[00:17:56.059 --> 00:18:01.043]  And I tore the page out and took it home and covered it on air and it's a big red demon on the cover.
[00:18:02.506 --> 00:18:08.632]  And you're in underground pits, and you emerge and kidnap children for the highest bonus points, and you torture the children.
[00:18:09.212 --> 00:18:16.019]  And the more pain you cause for the demons that suck the energy out, the bigger the underground army you built.
[00:18:16.039 --> 00:18:26.068]  And then finally, you march out with your armies, and it says you crush and you knock the smiles off the shining faces of the good people on the surface.
[00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:34.530]  And you stomp off into the little towns and cities and murder and torture.
[00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.011]  And then you take them down in your torture pit and torture them.
[00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:42.112]  And then you get to invade even larger cities the better you torture.
[00:18:43.833 --> 00:18:49.614]  And they've got those different car games where you rape the woman and then kill her.
[00:18:50.115 --> 00:18:51.355]  And you get the bonus money.
[00:18:52.155 --> 00:18:53.275]  The more heinous the act.
[00:18:55.456 --> 00:18:57.057]  Kids have been playing those for 10 years.
[00:18:57.097 --> 00:18:58.417]  They're in black ops right now.
[00:18:59.497 --> 00:19:01.418]  Right now they've got pliers on somebody's teeth.
[00:19:01.438 --> 00:19:02.679]  They're just ripping them out.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.142]  And of course it has nothing to do with fighting Al Qaeda.
[00:19:06.162 --> 00:19:07.603]  They are Al Qaeda.
[00:19:11.426 --> 00:19:12.747]  Don't you understand that?
[00:19:13.787 --> 00:19:18.391]  And don't neo-con your fat head and shake your head driving down the road right now.
[00:19:18.471 --> 00:19:20.072]  Don't you make excuses.
[00:19:20.712 --> 00:19:21.073]  Listen.
[00:19:21.773 --> 00:19:25.536]  You either call me out as a liar and you bring the proof or
[00:19:26.315 --> 00:19:33.079]  You go Google and you go research and you find mainstream documents, mainstream publications saying everything I'm saying.
[00:19:33.799 --> 00:19:34.719]  White House memos.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.362]  But don't you dare just say I'm lying.
[00:19:40.022 --> 00:19:42.684]  I demand you face this evil.
[00:19:44.585 --> 00:19:46.225]  We'll come back into this in a lot more.
[00:19:46.245 --> 00:19:47.426]  There's a ton of news today.
[00:19:47.866 --> 00:19:50.208]  And we'll be taking your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:55.497 --> 00:19:56.101]  Yeah.
[00:19:59.344 --> 00:20:02.366]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:20:02.686 --> 00:20:07.609]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:12.212]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:20:12.513 --> 00:20:21.418]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:20:21.639 --> 00:20:25.241]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:20:25.541 --> 00:20:30.564]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:20:30.844 --> 00:20:37.568]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:20:38.078 --> 00:20:38.719]  What about you?
[00:20:39.379 --> 00:20:44.724]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:20:59.449 --> 00:21:03.350]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:15.833]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:16.253 --> 00:21:16.673]  The U.S.
[00:21:16.713 --> 00:21:22.295]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:22.695 --> 00:21:24.896]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:26.776 --> 00:21:27.816]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:21:27.856 --> 00:21:30.717]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:21:30.817 --> 00:21:36.859]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.621]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[00:21:51.948 --> 00:21:52.148]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.208 --> 00:22:02.270]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:02.891 --> 00:22:11.821]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:12.282 --> 00:22:19.490]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:20.186 --> 00:22:25.689]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:24:13.224 --> 00:24:15.266]  Alright, thanks for joining us.
[00:24:20.832 --> 00:24:22.754]  Secret U.S.
[00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:27.319]  endorsement of severe interrogations.
[00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:28.840]  We don't torture you.
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.424]  And I've heard national talk show hosts and politicians say this.
[00:24:32.524 --> 00:24:34.106]  Waterboarding isn't torture.
[00:24:35.399 --> 00:24:41.344]  By the way, they keep showing on television that it's putting a bag over somebody's head or cloth and then pouring water on their face.
[00:24:42.005 --> 00:24:44.046]  That's not the classical waterboarding.
[00:24:44.587 --> 00:24:50.472]  It's called boarding because they put you on a board that they can slide down into water.
[00:24:52.073 --> 00:24:54.876]  Have you seen Conspiracy Theory with Mel Gibson?
[00:24:54.936 --> 00:24:55.957]  That's waterboarding.
[00:24:57.058 --> 00:24:59.740]  Where they have him in the chair.
[00:25:01.062 --> 00:25:05.264]  Trap down to a chair and they hoist the chair up and put him into the water.
[00:25:05.724 --> 00:25:07.025]  That's waterboarding.
[00:25:08.865 --> 00:25:18.109]  Now classically the French, it was one of their favorite tactics, would do it by just having you on a board and then you could just have a bucket and slide the head into the bucket.
[00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:25.952]  And it causes hysteria, it causes panic, it is psychological and physical.
[00:25:27.393 --> 00:25:29.794]  And they just do that over and over again until you break.
[00:25:31.401 --> 00:25:41.848]  And our own army handbooks, back before all this was legitimized, said that it didn't really work because it would generally give you false info and that people would just tell you whatever they wanted you to hear.
[00:25:42.008 --> 00:25:48.572]  But it works if you want people to incriminate themselves, if you want to break them down psychologically.
[00:25:48.632 --> 00:25:52.294]  Some people just in a few sessions of torture, others in a few months.
[00:25:52.874 --> 00:25:55.136]  This happened to our airmen in Vietnam and Korea.
[00:25:55.616 --> 00:25:56.777]  They'll say whatever you want!
[00:25:59.076 --> 00:26:05.402]  And you can notice that the few people they've taken to trial, that later came out they were tortured, are just complete basket cases.
[00:26:05.442 --> 00:26:06.303]  They can hardly talk.
[00:26:06.984 --> 00:26:08.185]  And they're just shaking.
[00:26:08.746 --> 00:26:09.827]  And completely drugged out.
[00:26:10.548 --> 00:26:14.491]  Because they have been tortured to lengths unimaginable.
[00:26:14.972 --> 00:26:18.075]  See, you can't trust a government that tortures.
[00:26:18.115 --> 00:26:22.960]  You can't trust a government that has secret police and secretly arrests people.
[00:26:24.085 --> 00:26:26.868]  Just like Ron Paul has always been for the death penalty, I've always been for it.
[00:26:27.369 --> 00:26:30.833]  And I thought he was still for it, and the last few years I've been saying I'm against it now.
[00:26:32.234 --> 00:26:36.159]  And then I was pleasantly surprised last week during the debate when he said I'm now against it.
[00:26:36.579 --> 00:26:39.983]  Because this government is so corrupt
[00:26:40.603 --> 00:26:46.146]  See, that was one of the few issues I disagree with Ron Paul on, is I have told you the last few years I'm against the death penalty.
[00:26:46.626 --> 00:26:53.409]  Because the government's so corrupt and frames so many people, and has been caught doing it the majority of the time.
[00:26:53.629 --> 00:26:55.750]  It's not like there's rare cases, it's just everywhere.
[00:26:56.411 --> 00:27:00.793]  So, you can't trust them to administer the death penalty.
[00:27:02.072 --> 00:27:03.573]  Oh, I say kill Jeffrey Dahmer.
[00:27:03.633 --> 00:27:05.795]  I say kill John Wayne Gacy.
[00:27:05.855 --> 00:27:06.515]  I say kill him.
[00:27:06.555 --> 00:27:15.021]  I mean, if you find 20 bodies under the house and they've got photos of what they did, I think in very special cases at the state level, they should still be executed.
[00:27:16.222 --> 00:27:17.243]  But wait a minute.
[00:27:17.303 --> 00:27:18.884]  They've framed so many people.
[00:27:18.984 --> 00:27:26.550]  I think if they just claim they've got some blood, they've been caught planting that hundreds of times just in Texas, just in Houston alone, thousands, 4,000 times.
[00:27:27.831 --> 00:27:29.752]  That was a few years ago, Houston Chronicle.
[00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:32.251]  That you can't believe them.
[00:27:32.331 --> 00:27:34.072]  So, I mean, I'm conflicted.
[00:27:34.092 --> 00:27:36.054]  There's a few things that I find are an enigma.
[00:27:37.014 --> 00:27:41.217]  Because, you know, somebody gets caught with a dead kid in the back of their trunk, they should be executed.
[00:27:42.118 --> 00:27:42.778]  But wait a minute.
[00:27:43.278 --> 00:27:54.266]  If we execute that piece of trash, what about the 30 plus percent of people on death row nationwide, it's even higher in Texas, who have now been proven to be innocent?
[00:27:54.806 --> 00:27:57.008]  They either catch the person later that really did it,
[00:27:58.166 --> 00:28:03.070]  And they admit to it, and they have all the evidence, and DNA on top of it, then they're forced to release them.
[00:28:03.831 --> 00:28:05.352]  And you know, there's been a bunch of those cases.
[00:28:05.732 --> 00:28:07.794]  Do we want innocent men and women to die?
[00:28:09.615 --> 00:28:18.242]  I say for people caught red-handed, I mean, with a really high standard of evidence, put them on a deserted island.
[00:28:19.764 --> 00:28:27.590]  I mean, that has no substance, where they're going to die in a few months, where they might be able to eke out an existence for a few months, with their fellow kind.
[00:28:29.292 --> 00:28:31.354]  I really more and more believe in that.
[00:28:32.915 --> 00:28:41.422]  I just think having a corrupt state trap somebody down to a gurney and run poison into them is a fraud.
[00:28:42.443 --> 00:28:47.507]  And people say, oh well, you know, all these death row people say they're innocent.
[00:28:47.867 --> 00:28:49.669]  It's being proven all the time!
[00:28:49.689 --> 00:28:52.871]  And when you're talking about over 30% nationally, 30 plus percent,
[00:28:59.873 --> 00:29:06.958]  How can you kill close to a third of the people who you know are innocent?
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.442]  Because, well, at least we got some of the other bad guys.
[00:29:11.862 --> 00:29:19.408]  And then the corrupt fascist states argument is always, well, usually whoever we're killing already had a couple other convictions.
[00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:26.373]  Yeah, well, how many of you did things when you were a teenager you didn't get caught for?
[00:29:27.563 --> 00:29:28.703]  That would have had you with a record.
[00:29:28.963 --> 00:29:30.024]  I want to ask cops that.
[00:29:30.644 --> 00:29:37.045]  How many of you take young teenagers to jail every day for things you did?
[00:29:38.645 --> 00:29:38.845]  See?
[00:29:38.865 --> 00:29:44.887]  Alright, we'll be back again in this big news, because Bush is caught red-handed.
[00:29:44.907 --> 00:29:46.387]  He needs to be indicted right now.
[00:29:49.748 --> 00:29:50.708]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.148 --> 00:29:52.748]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.668 --> 00:29:56.369]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:02.673]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:30:02.833 --> 00:30:07.998]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:30:08.358 --> 00:30:13.623]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:14.064 --> 00:30:15.205]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:15.545 --> 00:30:24.414]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:30:24.854 --> 00:30:26.475]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:30:26.695 --> 00:30:30.877]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:30:59.622 --> 00:31:03.064]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:31:03.304 --> 00:31:05.425]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:31:05.565 --> 00:31:08.026]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:31:08.286 --> 00:31:12.649]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[00:31:12.689 --> 00:31:13.369]  Here's why.
[00:31:13.769 --> 00:31:19.712]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:31:19.952 --> 00:31:25.935]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[00:31:26.175 --> 00:31:27.096]  But they're not cheating.
[00:31:27.336 --> 00:31:31.321]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[00:31:31.521 --> 00:31:35.866]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[00:31:35.966 --> 00:31:43.474]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[00:31:43.514 --> 00:31:44.055]  Get control.
[00:31:44.335 --> 00:31:44.896]  Get relief.
[00:31:44.956 --> 00:31:45.657]  Get some sleep.
[00:31:45.777 --> 00:31:48.981]  Go to www.OutIn90.com.
[00:31:49.101 --> 00:31:52.466]  That's www.OutIn90.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:31:52.506 --> 00:31:52.746]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:01.890]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:07.211]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:32:07.371 --> 00:32:08.712]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:32:08.992 --> 00:32:17.153]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:32:17.373 --> 00:32:23.154]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:32:23.174 --> 00:32:25.035]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:32:25.135 --> 00:32:27.215]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:32:27.435 --> 00:32:31.682]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:32:31.843 --> 00:32:33.986]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:32:34.066 --> 00:32:40.818]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular
[00:32:43.046 --> 00:32:43.646]  We're good to go.
[00:33:12.633 --> 00:33:36.976]  I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole
[00:33:39.255 --> 00:33:58.351]  The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become?
[00:34:01.374 --> 00:34:03.395]  My sweetest friend
[00:34:06.179 --> 00:34:16.090]  Everyone I know goes away in the end.
[00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:21.435]  And you could have it all, my empire of dirt.
[00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:43.333]  Dan in New Zealand, Jason in Ohio, Grim in New York, Laura in Boston, Fred in Arkansas.
[00:34:44.453 --> 00:34:46.154]  Your calls are coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:34:48.856 --> 00:34:53.598]  I think about the establishment lapdogs.
[00:34:54.779 --> 00:34:57.600]  All the desperate, insecure, pretty faces.
[00:34:59.241 --> 00:35:02.223]  How they miss the majesty, the beauty, the enchantment.
[00:35:03.152 --> 00:35:05.613]  Of everything that's around us and how they feel inadequate.
[00:35:06.154 --> 00:35:08.595]  How Madison Avenue rules their psyches.
[00:35:10.016 --> 00:35:14.498]  How they buy into the globalist corporate culture of serfdom and enslavement.
[00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:23.243]  A culture that is there to literally sap your ingenuity, destroy your mind, and wreck your future.
[00:35:23.883 --> 00:35:24.564]  The globalist
[00:35:25.703 --> 00:35:26.804]  Are almost blind.
[00:35:26.844 --> 00:35:28.745]  All they see is power structures.
[00:35:29.185 --> 00:35:34.808]  All they see is power structures they don't control as resistance to them.
[00:35:35.208 --> 00:35:37.610]  And so they seek to destroy any sovereign nations.
[00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:39.451]  They seek to destroy the family.
[00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:47.115]  They seek any institution or body that is not under their complete control and hegemony.
[00:35:49.406 --> 00:36:02.171]  Before I get back into the torture and finish up with it, and it is big news to have it now admitted, what we already know, but now in triplicate, that Bush ordered it all, and that they're sending people to prison that followed his orders.
[00:36:02.211 --> 00:36:05.812]  That is a special level of corruption, is it not?
[00:36:06.372 --> 00:36:08.893]  But one that we see in the corrupt empires.
[00:36:09.034 --> 00:36:10.494]  It's the norm, not the exception.
[00:36:11.214 --> 00:36:13.715]  But I played this at the very end of the show yesterday.
[00:36:13.735 --> 00:36:16.977]  If you go to InfoWars.com,
[00:36:19.264 --> 00:36:20.685]  It is up on the main page.
[00:36:21.425 --> 00:36:24.906]  You can find all four of the trailers now from Endgame.
[00:36:24.926 --> 00:36:29.688]  The two little sneak peeks, the intro from the film, and then this is the official trailer.
[00:36:29.708 --> 00:36:32.109]  This is the best one yet.
[00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:35.650]  And if you go to InfoWars.com, it's the best place to find it.
[00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:36.851]  It's right at the top.
[00:36:36.911 --> 00:36:41.392]  It says, New Official Endgame Trailer.
[00:36:43.553 --> 00:36:47.855]  Again, New Official Endgame Trailer.
[00:36:49.538 --> 00:36:56.023]  And we ask you to spread the word on the trailer and get it out to everybody because this really does cover the globalist big picture.
[00:36:57.344 --> 00:37:00.327]  The globalist master plan, I think it's going to be the film.
[00:37:01.808 --> 00:37:10.835]  People that have seen it at the four or five showings here in Austin and in New York have said that it wasn't hype when I said it was my best work and really extremely powerful.
[00:37:12.319 --> 00:37:28.347]  It goes to the past, the globalist empires, how they operate, the present at Bilderberg Group meetings, and what their current agenda is, and then why they want world government, so they can veto and block any country, any state, any individual, any group, from resisting them as they carry out their extermination op.
[00:37:29.085 --> 00:37:37.150]  So here's the two minute new trailer, the audio from it, you gotta go see the video at InfoWars.com and I'll finish up with the torture news and I promise we'll start taking your calls.
[00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:49.938]  But here is the new official, and this is the final by the way, we're gonna have one more sneak peek we released today before the film comes out in a few weeks, but this is the official trailer, this is the last trailer, this is the new official in-game trailer.
[00:37:51.559 --> 00:37:53.020]  It is a big idea.
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.101]  A new world order.
[00:37:59.483 --> 00:38:05.666]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:38:05.706 --> 00:38:07.506]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:38:07.526 --> 00:38:10.808]  Wouldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:38:12.969 --> 00:38:15.470]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:23.813]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:38:30.507 --> 00:38:35.530]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:41.112]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:38:41.132 --> 00:38:45.094]  The Americans are making great progress toward a world without them.
[00:38:45.214 --> 00:38:48.756]  Only an educated and informed population can stop them in their tracks.
[00:38:49.116 --> 00:38:51.697]  Alex, shut up, will you?
[00:38:51.777 --> 00:38:54.859]  For the first time, all the pieces have been put together.
[00:38:55.519 --> 00:38:58.761]  The dots have been connected, and the picture is crystal clear.
[00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:01.931]  The New World Order is the Old World Order.
[00:39:01.951 --> 00:39:04.713]  I mean, it's just the names have changed, the appearances have changed.
[00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:27.911]  Most people have no idea.
[00:39:27.931 --> 00:39:28.711]  They're not after money.
[00:39:28.751 --> 00:39:29.812]  They have all the money they need.
[00:39:30.072 --> 00:39:30.813]  They're after power.
[00:39:31.773 --> 00:39:32.694]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:39:33.394 --> 00:39:36.296]  I was pulled off a plane.
[00:39:36.356 --> 00:39:38.017]  I knew when they could be interrogated in four hours.
[00:39:38.077 --> 00:39:39.098]  Some shots were fired.
[00:39:39.158 --> 00:39:40.478]  I need you to move off the front.
[00:39:41.479 --> 00:39:49.764]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:39:50.024 --> 00:39:50.384]  MJ.
[00:39:50.725 --> 00:39:52.466]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:39:52.786 --> 00:39:53.967]  You have been warned.
[00:39:58.681 --> 00:40:01.523]  That's right, my friends, you have been warned.
[00:40:02.423 --> 00:40:04.965]  We have laid it out like no one else has ever done.
[00:40:05.065 --> 00:40:06.686]  It is hard core.
[00:40:09.708 --> 00:40:12.149]  And I want this film out to the four wins.
[00:40:12.469 --> 00:40:19.153]  Launch date on the web, October 26 for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:40:20.314 --> 00:40:25.297]  And we've got it hooked up to a content distribution network and three other servers as backups.
[00:40:26.357 --> 00:40:27.198]  And I'm launching
[00:40:28.448 --> 00:40:31.370]  A whole nother PrisonPlanet.tv membership system.
[00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:34.151]  It'll be a clone, just new members can join there if you want.
[00:40:34.171 --> 00:40:40.595]  It'll be the exact same thing on PrisonPlanet.tv, just as another redundancy with its own backup systems.
[00:40:41.535 --> 00:40:47.538]  As we know, hard times are coming up and there's going to be big shake-ups in the Internet, big shake-ups in companies and backbones.
[00:40:48.099 --> 00:40:54.382]  That's why we're trying to get as many servers across as many systems as possible as Internet 2 starts blasting out the old web.
[00:40:56.155 --> 00:40:58.676]  I don't want to get too technical into it, but we're in trouble, folks.
[00:40:58.716 --> 00:41:02.497]  The enemy's moving big time right now against free humanity.
[00:41:04.858 --> 00:41:05.978]  But we're fighting back.
[00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:14.081]  And there was a film crew here in town interviewing me for a table TV production.
[00:41:14.581 --> 00:41:15.901]  I'll just leave it at that, yesterday.
[00:41:15.921 --> 00:41:23.924]  They interviewed me in this big hall at the Hyatt, and then they took me to dinner afterwards,
[00:41:25.598 --> 00:41:29.380]  And I have never had this many people come up to me, even in Austin.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.601]  I mean, it was just, it was like everybody that walked by.
[00:41:33.522 --> 00:41:38.664]  To the point of I couldn't, and they were all really nice people too, to the point of where I couldn't even hardly eat.
[00:41:41.946 --> 00:41:47.549]  And I use that as a gauge of how many people we've woken up.
[00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:53.952]  I had people come up to me all over Ottawa when I was in Canada last year.
[00:41:55.256 --> 00:41:57.497]  When I was in England, I only had three people come up to me.
[00:41:58.878 --> 00:41:59.998]  But still, that's in London.
[00:42:00.759 --> 00:42:01.779]  And that was two years ago.
[00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:02.640]  It's exponential.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.021]  When I'm in LA, people all over the place come up to me.
[00:42:05.501 --> 00:42:08.123]  All over New York, on subways, hey, you're Alex Jones.
[00:42:08.563 --> 00:42:13.825]  And again, I'm just one person in this movement, but I use that as a sonar ping.
[00:42:14.526 --> 00:42:17.947]  When they talk to me and respond, it means they know what's going on.
[00:42:19.668 --> 00:42:20.469]  It's a gauge.
[00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:24.831]  And people really are waking up, so that's the exciting news.
[00:42:29.039 --> 00:42:41.771]  By the way, for PrisonPlanet.TV members, I'm sure you've noticed that usually the downloads were pretty fast, unless it was like 7, 8, 9 at night when people were really getting in there en masse or when we had a new video out.
[00:42:42.872 --> 00:42:44.313]  Not a problem anymore, folks.
[00:42:44.433 --> 00:42:45.114]  It's fast.
[00:42:45.234 --> 00:42:48.837]  I mean, it's four times KeyOne's download speeds if you've got a fast connection.
[00:42:49.538 --> 00:42:53.842]  With this content distribution network we've got where it's on hundreds of servers across the world,
[00:42:55.327 --> 00:42:56.047]  We're good to go.
[00:43:19.154 --> 00:43:19.534]  All of it.
[00:43:20.094 --> 00:43:24.837]  So that you can burn them to disk and they really look good when you give them to friends and family.
[00:43:25.358 --> 00:43:29.861]  Okay, I want to go to Dan, Jason, all the other people that are holding Dan's in New Zealand, so I want to go to him first.
[00:43:30.601 --> 00:43:37.706]  Before we do that, I kind of did the history of torture again and the hypocrisy and the unbelievable spinning that we're seeing.
[00:43:40.448 --> 00:43:42.489]  New York Times today, more spin.
[00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:46.372]  Secret US endorsement of severe interrogation.
[00:43:48.018 --> 00:43:57.084]  Next time you get drunk at a bar and get in a fist fight and you break somebody's jaw, and the cops are arresting you, say, I didn't assault him.
[00:43:57.264 --> 00:43:59.765]  I sternly talked to him.
[00:43:59.785 --> 00:44:03.928]  Or I gave him a hug.
[00:44:03.988 --> 00:44:07.750]  I mean, again, they just change the way words are used.
[00:44:08.691 --> 00:44:09.391]  Secret U.S.
[00:44:10.112 --> 00:44:11.973]  endorsement of severe interrogation.
[00:44:13.126 --> 00:44:36.350]  When the Justice Department publicly declared torture abhorrent in a legal opinion in December 2004, that's after they got caught writing the most thing that could kill people, the Bush administration appeared to have abandoned its assertion of nearly unlimited, they didn't say nearly, they said unlimited, presidential authority to order brutal interrogations.
[00:44:36.931 --> 00:44:38.811]  We don't call it torture, we call it brutal.
[00:44:39.665 --> 00:44:44.508]  Drilling kneecaps, pulling teeth out, electro-shocking people, stopping their hearts.
[00:44:45.229 --> 00:45:00.778]  Because, by the way, at these black sites, these are laboratories, and they've admitted that they, instead of waterboarding, they got a system where they just turn your heart on and off with electro-shocks, with defibrillators, and you're sitting there gasping dead, and they go, did you like dying?
[00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:03.220]  Of course, you die a lot of the time.
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:05.962]  They can't get you going again, especially if you're over 40.
[00:45:07.999 --> 00:45:08.780]  But they don't care.
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:12.602]  It's all real funny and these sickos on Fox News lickin' their lips when they talk about it.
[00:45:14.302 --> 00:45:21.105]  But soon after Alberto R. Gonzalez's arrival as Attorney General in February of 2005, the Justice Department issued another opinion.
[00:45:22.246 --> 00:45:23.406]  This one in secret.
[00:45:24.767 --> 00:45:28.929]  Kind of like your amnesty bill was in secret, but you said, just trust us, it's not amnesty.
[00:45:29.409 --> 00:45:31.350]  Then it turned out it was worse than amnesty.
[00:45:32.592 --> 00:45:44.435]  It was a very different document, according to officials briefed on it, an expansive endorsement of the harshest interrogation techniques ever used by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:45:47.075 --> 00:45:49.236]  And, uh, do I need to go through it again?
[00:45:49.256 --> 00:45:55.197]  See, they had basic torture at Camp X-Ray, just kind of a public camp.
[00:45:55.237 --> 00:45:57.397]  That was the public camp to introduce you to it.
[00:45:57.597 --> 00:46:00.218]  Then they had a CIA-controlled camp within X-Ray.
[00:46:01.664 --> 00:46:05.748]  And they would beat people and electrocute them and torture them and do all these things to them.
[00:46:06.228 --> 00:46:14.775]  But also they would send in prostitutes who were having their female time of the month.
[00:46:14.895 --> 00:46:18.238]  And if you have children listening, I can't get into all of them with adults.
[00:46:18.919 --> 00:46:20.761]  But I mean, we need to know what they're doing, don't we?
[00:46:20.801 --> 00:46:21.801]  This needs to be on record.
[00:46:23.022 --> 00:46:29.108]  The point is, these devout Muslims really got freaked out by this.
[00:46:30.817 --> 00:46:33.501]  By the women and the blood and the little devil chants.
[00:46:34.442 --> 00:46:36.344]  These guys, you know, did not enjoy it.
[00:46:36.404 --> 00:46:38.848]  Because they think they're going to go to hell if they're unclean like that.
[00:46:41.992 --> 00:46:43.754]  I mean, again, it's all real sick.
[00:46:44.895 --> 00:46:47.198]  Because the people devising all this are sickos.
[00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:54.382]  Bolton, all the stuff he admittedly in the news has been caught doing with S&M and prostitutes and all this.
[00:46:54.722 --> 00:46:56.203]  And hey, that's his business, okay?
[00:46:56.243 --> 00:47:02.386]  I know he's a Christian conservative leader and a right winger and the fake churches all love him, but why then is brutal S&M okay?
[00:47:02.406 --> 00:47:08.609]  You know, his wife filed that in the divorce proceedings.
[00:47:08.649 --> 00:47:09.430]  He didn't even deny it.
[00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:10.130]  He said, so what?
[00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:14.236]  I mean, the point is, is that they're all into this, folks.
[00:47:14.796 --> 00:47:20.098]  And if you want to go into some dungeon and have somebody beat you upside the head with a bullwhip, that's your business.
[00:47:21.358 --> 00:47:24.739]  But let me tell you, you don't go grab people off the streets and go do that because you like it.
[00:47:24.759 --> 00:47:25.339]  You understand?
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:28.080]  And that's what these guys are into.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:29.441]  They are freaks, folks!
[00:47:29.761 --> 00:47:31.842]  They want all this torture because they like it!
[00:47:32.342 --> 00:47:33.202]  You understand that?
[00:47:36.184 --> 00:47:41.325]  By the way, the White House, it's been in the news, one of the snuff films delivered to them and they screened them along with Congress.
[00:47:41.365 --> 00:47:42.665]  I mean, these are sickos, folks.
[00:47:46.566 --> 00:47:47.967]  They like watching snuff films.
[00:47:52.028 --> 00:47:55.048]  That's another thing they do in the torture is they show them video of killing other people.
[00:47:55.908 --> 00:48:03.210]  I mean, this is the blackest, most wicked stuff directly out of the deepest, darkest, stinkiest pit of hell.
[00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:10.954]  And we got all these snickering pundits everywhere thinking we're so dumb that we're going to embrace this!
[00:48:11.014 --> 00:48:30.969]  And let me tell you, a lot of these soft people who've never gone without food, who've never been in a bad car wreck, who've never been in combat, who've never been in a fish fight, who've had soft lives their whole life, who've never really seen the dark side, that's another thing, they just sit there softly
[00:48:31.747 --> 00:48:35.311]  You know, in their soft little cushy lives, going, oh yes, I'm for it.
[00:48:35.631 --> 00:48:38.274]  Don't you understand what that means, you fools?
[00:48:38.534 --> 00:48:41.358]  Once you release this hell, it's uncontrollable!
[00:48:42.999 --> 00:48:47.084]  Don't you understand the seething black power that's rising?
[00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:52.610]  Literal hell being released?
[00:48:58.863 --> 00:49:03.106]  Hitler didn't go in public and say they tortured people.
[00:49:03.546 --> 00:49:09.611]  Joseph Mingala, the angel of death, didn't go and publicly talk about all this stuff.
[00:49:12.613 --> 00:49:21.099]  We have reached a new low in this country, where our leaders publicly talk about torturing small children.
[00:49:24.181 --> 00:49:27.784]  Even in the depths of Rome's depravity, they didn't do that.
[00:49:30.379 --> 00:49:33.301]  Only the Aztecs have sunk that low.
[00:49:34.902 --> 00:49:39.825]  And they were ignorant, primitive savages, drugged out on hallucinogens.
[00:49:42.747 --> 00:49:59.979]  This is a modern, civilized nation, completely hijacked by the New World Order, and they're putting all this torture news out on purpose to demonize our good name, while domestically shelling you fools on being tortured yourself.
[00:50:04.361 --> 00:50:08.742]  So that woman at the airport, now top forensic experts are all on record saying they killed her.
[00:50:09.282 --> 00:50:11.463]  You can't choke yourself with your own handcuffs.
[00:50:12.263 --> 00:50:14.784]  Witnesses, they were jumping all over and stomping her.
[00:50:15.804 --> 00:50:17.104]  The little lady died.
[00:50:17.765 --> 00:50:18.485]  You killed her.
[00:50:19.685 --> 00:50:21.646]  That little black girl whose arm you broke.
[00:50:22.046 --> 00:50:23.446]  And then the police put out the report.
[00:50:23.486 --> 00:50:23.986]  It's public.
[00:50:24.046 --> 00:50:25.247]  It's in the Daily News.
[00:50:26.747 --> 00:50:33.609]  It said she didn't resist, but the officer, the security guard was in his rights because he felt like he needed to control her.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.102]  You didn't resist, but I'm gonna break your arm, little girl.
[00:50:38.902 --> 00:50:42.645]  And then I'm gonna arrest everybody that videotapes it.
[00:50:44.186 --> 00:50:44.626]  You see?
[00:50:46.547 --> 00:50:49.129]  You thought it was for the Arabs that we're gonna get tortured.
[00:50:50.009 --> 00:50:51.690]  It's for you, fool.
[00:50:52.611 --> 00:50:55.713]  We'll go directly to New Zealand on the other side of this break.
[00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:05.591]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:05.951 --> 00:51:07.871]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:08.251 --> 00:51:15.912]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:16.572 --> 00:51:23.634]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:30.975]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:31.403 --> 00:51:35.407]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:35.747 --> 00:51:39.690]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:41.672]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:41.992 --> 00:51:45.916]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:05.588]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:52:05.928 --> 00:52:10.012]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:52:10.312 --> 00:52:10.853]  We listened.
[00:52:11.173 --> 00:52:16.157]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:52:16.438 --> 00:52:16.918]  We listened.
[00:52:17.298 --> 00:52:20.341]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:52:20.761 --> 00:52:21.282]  We listened.
[00:52:21.742 --> 00:52:25.803]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:52:26.204 --> 00:52:26.664]  We listened.
[00:52:27.024 --> 00:52:32.266]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:52:32.666 --> 00:52:34.046]  Again, we listened.
[00:52:34.386 --> 00:52:36.647]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity
[00:52:36.767 --> 00:52:37.207]  We're good to go.
[00:52:58.197 --> 00:52:58.737]  Hey, Emily!
[00:52:59.018 --> 00:52:59.878]  Wow, you look great!
[00:53:00.098 --> 00:53:00.919]  I feel great!
[00:53:01.159 --> 00:53:02.940]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:03.540]  Really?
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:04.161]  What is it?
[00:53:04.381 --> 00:53:04.861]  How does it work?
[00:53:05.041 --> 00:53:11.645]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[00:53:11.785 --> 00:53:14.067]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[00:53:14.287 --> 00:53:19.590]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:20.410]  That's it?
[00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:22.211]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[00:53:22.471 --> 00:53:23.191]  It is easy.
[00:53:23.391 --> 00:53:30.094]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:53:30.374 --> 00:53:31.874]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[00:53:32.195 --> 00:53:32.915]  That's amazing!
[00:53:33.315 --> 00:53:38.657]  And, the bentonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:53:38.997 --> 00:53:39.317]  Wow!
[00:53:39.538 --> 00:53:40.638]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[00:53:40.919 --> 00:53:43.761]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[00:53:43.861 --> 00:53:47.043]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[00:53:47.183 --> 00:53:50.606]  For only $22.95 plus shipping, MediCleanse is shipped directly to you.

[00:53:51.527 --> 00:53:51.807]  That's 1-800-317-9547.
[00:53:51.847 --> 00:53:52.207]  Call today.
[00:53:52.227 --> 00:53:52.988]  I was a highway man.
[00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:30.951]  Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
[00:54:33.453 --> 00:54:41.241]  Welcome back.
[00:54:41.441 --> 00:54:46.606]  Let's go to New Zealand and talk to Dan, who's been holding patiently.
[00:54:46.887 --> 00:54:47.567]  Dan, welcome.
[00:54:48.428 --> 00:54:49.309]  Hi, Alex.
[00:54:49.369 --> 00:54:49.789]  How are you?
[00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:50.650]  Thanks for calling.
[00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:51.231]  What's on your mind?
[00:54:52.388 --> 00:54:59.712]  Well, I just wanted to first say thanks for the opportunity to call and I know you've got a busy show and you've got other callers that are wanting to come through.
[00:54:59.732 --> 00:55:10.638]  I just wanted to first ask whether or not it's possible after your program to have my details passed on so I can be contacted.
[00:55:10.938 --> 00:55:20.463]  I've just got a whole lot of information and possible evidence and documents that I would like to share with you and your staff.
[00:55:21.477 --> 00:55:31.787]  Well, I mean, it's a catch-22 like everything is, because we are wallowing in documents and information, but at the same time, I don't want to tell people don't send them.
[00:55:33.168 --> 00:55:43.498]  It's just that... I have like 25 phone calls I have to make when I get off the air today, and I would love to be able to talk to you in New Zealand.
[00:55:43.518 --> 00:55:45.921]  Can you just send me an email with a synopsis of what it is?
[00:55:47.251 --> 00:55:47.891]  Yeah, for sure.
[00:55:48.231 --> 00:55:52.173]  I'd actually sent a couple through, but I hadn't received a reply.
[00:55:52.193 --> 00:55:56.454]  I think I sent them to Aaron and Steve, not directly to you.
[00:55:56.754 --> 00:55:58.614]  I mean, what does the information pertain to?
[00:56:00.095 --> 00:56:03.956]  The events on September 11th and the direct collapse of the two towers.
[00:56:04.536 --> 00:56:05.196]  Video evidence.
[00:56:07.517 --> 00:56:09.338]  Well, there's quite a few people looking at that.
[00:56:09.378 --> 00:56:10.258]  What did you discover?
[00:56:12.679 --> 00:56:13.699]  I'd rather not say on air.
[00:56:16.214 --> 00:56:21.038]  If it's what I think it is, then it's pretty important.
[00:56:21.939 --> 00:56:23.400]  I bet it is.
[00:56:23.581 --> 00:56:25.402]  I'm looking at Aaron out the window right now.
[00:56:25.903 --> 00:56:28.145]  Send it again and I'll have a look at it during a break, my friend.
[00:56:28.365 --> 00:56:29.786]  Where are you in New Zealand?
[00:56:30.907 --> 00:56:32.328]  Capital City, Wellington.
[00:56:33.629 --> 00:56:35.091]  Is it a nice weather there right now?
[00:56:36.091 --> 00:56:39.194]  It's pretty dark.
[00:56:39.254 --> 00:56:39.694]  It's cool.
[00:56:42.239 --> 00:56:45.701]  There's two main islands, New Zealand and Asia.
[00:56:45.781 --> 00:56:46.942]  You may well know.
[00:56:47.102 --> 00:56:48.523]  I've never been there.
[00:56:48.923 --> 00:56:49.723]  It looks pretty to me.
[00:56:49.743 --> 00:56:51.344]  You've got to come over.
[00:56:52.405 --> 00:56:53.406]  I wish I had time.
[00:56:53.426 --> 00:56:54.186]  I wish I had the money.
[00:56:54.206 --> 00:56:59.689]  I'm just stuck here like I'm a slave down a mine or something.
[00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:04.272]  There's more important things to be doing than holidaying.
[00:57:04.572 --> 00:57:10.636]  As times do get better, which I personally and I know that you and all your team do,
[00:57:11.309 --> 00:57:20.535]  And many people around the world do pray and hope for better times, then definitely make your way down here.
[00:57:21.395 --> 00:57:32.742]  I first became sort of awoken to everything that was going on by someone passing me a disc with your specific production for them.
[00:57:33.142 --> 00:57:33.562]  Good!
[00:57:34.203 --> 00:57:37.225]  Yeah, and I sat through each one.
[00:57:41.425 --> 00:57:57.616]  I actually missed the whole event of the two hours of the attacks because I was in New Zealand and I was sleeping and I woke up right at the beginning of the attacks but didn't turn the television on.
[00:57:57.696 --> 00:57:59.037]  I just was doing something else.
[00:57:59.217 --> 00:58:00.798]  So I wake up in the middle of the night.
[00:58:01.218 --> 00:58:02.159]  I hear you my friend.
[00:58:02.419 --> 00:58:03.159]  We got a jump.
[00:58:03.179 --> 00:58:04.260]  Good to hear from you Dan.
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.101]  Send me that info.
[00:58:05.481 --> 00:58:07.182]  We're going to break for 70 seconds.
[00:58:07.222 --> 00:58:08.403]  We'll come back and go to Jason.
[00:58:09.506 --> 00:58:14.129]  Grim, Laura, Fred, and others.
[00:58:14.149 --> 00:58:14.349]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:14.369 --> 00:58:15.770]  Have your questions, your comments ready.
[00:58:17.211 --> 00:58:23.115]  Coming up, oh, there's a lot of other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[00:58:25.517 --> 00:58:29.399]  And we'll also get into some more news.
[00:58:29.419 --> 00:58:33.062]  I'm going to build up for war with Iran, the economy, a lot more.
[00:58:33.162 --> 00:58:34.743]  Second and third hour, straight ahead.
[00:58:39.193 --> 00:58:43.274]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:43.294 --> 00:58:43.474]  Hello!
[00:58:43.494 --> 00:58:43.794]  Big Brother.
[00:58:43.814 --> 00:58:44.334]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:44.994]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:45.014 --> 00:58:45.434]  You want answers?
[00:59:01.568 --> 00:59:02.448]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:02.488 --> 00:59:07.110]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:13.832]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.112 --> 00:59:20.875]  Coming up, man executed after court refuses to remain open for extra 20 minutes to hear appeal.
[00:59:22.535 --> 00:59:29.578]  The CIA says that only two dozen al-Qaeda left in the world, but we've still got to give up all of our rights or they'll attack us.
[00:59:30.643 --> 00:59:33.084]  I want to take a lot of calls here in this hour.
[00:59:33.124 --> 00:59:34.124]  We're doing it right now.
[00:59:34.525 --> 00:59:36.465]  Jason in Ohio, you're on the air.
[00:59:36.545 --> 00:59:36.965]  Go ahead.
[00:59:38.526 --> 00:59:39.707]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:59:39.727 --> 00:59:39.987]  Good.
[00:59:40.767 --> 00:59:41.347]  Good.
[00:59:41.627 --> 00:59:48.190]  You're not going to have a lot of time to promote your materials if it's like any other broadcast, so I just want to promote them for you.
[00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:56.493]  Anyone out there who's listening, sign up for PrisonPlanet.tv and you know Ron Paul just
[00:59:57.003 --> 00:59:59.044]  Raise $5,000,000 this quarter.
[00:59:59.144 --> 01:00:01.705]  He's got to raise $15,000,000 this quarter.
[01:00:02.386 --> 01:00:13.591]  And I just want to encourage anyone to take $59, sign up for PrisonPlanet.tv and take the other $40 out of $100, donate it to the Ron Paul campaign and support the man
[01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:20.652]  Who has turned us all on to Ron Paul and who's opened our eyes and minds up to what's really going on in the New World Order.
[01:00:21.032 --> 01:00:21.932]  Well, it's exciting.
[01:00:21.972 --> 01:00:25.814]  Las Vegas has now got Paul 6-1 to win the presidency.
[01:00:26.174 --> 01:00:28.054]  He was 25-1, 15-1, 10-1.
[01:00:30.235 --> 01:00:35.156]  With his trajectory, he could win despite the media trying to sabotage him.
[01:00:35.456 --> 01:00:39.218]  Then people argue and they say, well Alex, you said the electronic voting machines are a fraud.
[01:00:39.778 --> 01:00:40.058]  Yes.
[01:00:40.978 --> 01:00:46.042]  More than a third of the country has them in, but we're discrediting them, we're exposing them.
[01:00:46.362 --> 01:00:59.531]  We've still got to attempt this, and regardless, Ron Paul is injecting at the national level real issues about the private fellow reserve, the inflation tax, the fraudulent war, the police state.
[01:01:00.431 --> 01:01:03.673]  I mean, just overall, it is a good thing that's happening.
[01:01:04.254 --> 01:01:07.636]  Yeah, definitely, and you know, I mean, I just think
[01:01:08.311 --> 01:01:13.476]  You know, my generation, I've never fought in a war, but we're in a war, and we've got to sacrifice.
[01:01:13.797 --> 01:01:22.525]  And if we've got to sacrifice not buying a $2 coffee a day to change the course of the country, then that's no sacrifice.
[01:01:22.625 --> 01:01:28.972]  We can all find ways to contribute to people like you, contribute to people like Ron Paul, to spread the word out where we're at.
[01:01:29.072 --> 01:01:31.114]  So I just want to charge people to do that.
[01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:32.235]  The hour is late.
[01:01:32.595 --> 01:01:33.236]  You're awesome.
[01:01:33.296 --> 01:01:34.818]  I appreciate your call, Jason.
[01:01:35.239 --> 01:01:36.621]  That's great advice, yes.
[01:01:37.182 --> 01:01:44.712]  The support we get is absolutely vital, and the more support we get, the more we can do, the more people we can hire full-time, the more action we can take.
[01:01:45.353 --> 01:01:47.075]  Let's talk to Laura in Boston.
[01:01:47.095 --> 01:01:47.916]  You're on the air, Laura.
[01:01:47.956 --> 01:01:48.497]  Thanks for holding.
[01:01:52.461 --> 01:01:53.301]  Yeah, Laura, go ahead.
[01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:53.882]  You're on the air.
[01:01:54.422 --> 01:01:54.982]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:55.002 --> 01:01:55.042]  Hi.
[01:01:55.423 --> 01:01:58.985]  I just want to thank you, first of all, for your incredible heroism.
[01:01:59.165 --> 01:02:00.505]  You don't need to thank me, please.
[01:02:00.545 --> 01:02:01.246]  I'm just getting the news out.
[01:02:01.266 --> 01:02:02.607]  I know, but I just want to say it.
[01:02:03.447 --> 01:02:12.152]  My question is regarding the New World Order, eugenics, you know, and your endgame.
[01:02:12.312 --> 01:02:12.552]  Yes.
[01:02:12.572 --> 01:02:15.273]  I haven't seen that, but I have this question.
[01:02:15.333 --> 01:02:19.696]  I cannot jive with the whole thing.
[01:02:20.473 --> 01:02:22.334]  About the giant corporations.
[01:02:22.854 --> 01:02:38.279]  Why would the giant corporations that are spread all over the world, like Coke, and you know, even Mobile, and all those big companies that have businesses everywhere, why would they stand by and let their consumer base be destroyed?
[01:02:39.879 --> 01:02:40.559]  What is that?
[01:02:40.919 --> 01:02:45.861]  Every time I get interviewed on a radio show, or TV like I was last night,
[01:02:47.397 --> 01:03:01.326]  On the in-game subject, on a population reduction subject, they bring up that very question and I can't answer it in the 60 seconds we've got right now, but go ahead and ask any other questions you've got and I'll come back and answer it.
[01:03:02.027 --> 01:03:07.390]  No, that's the main thing that I really want to know because I just keep coming up against it.
[01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:13.995]  I cannot understand why they would destroy, especially when you say they're trying to destroy the middle class.
[01:03:14.574 --> 01:03:17.877]  Now this is the biggest consumer nation in the world, right?
[01:03:18.358 --> 01:03:22.481]  I mean, we have incredible buying power still.
[01:03:23.282 --> 01:03:28.807]  Why would these corporations not have their own way to stop what's happening if that's going to happen?
[01:03:29.728 --> 01:03:30.729]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:03:30.769 --> 01:03:32.711]  I'm going to come back and try to answer your question.
[01:03:32.731 --> 01:03:38.136]  Then I'm going to go back to you, Laura, and see if you've got any other points or questions that you'd like to pose.
[01:03:38.863 --> 01:03:41.448]  And then we'll go to Fred, Jeff, and others.
[01:03:41.849 --> 01:03:47.479]  This is a very, very important question, and I'll try to answer it as succinctly as I can.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:04:01.143]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:04:01.403 --> 01:04:12.627]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:04:12.947 --> 01:04:17.989]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are
[01:04:18.029 --> 01:04:18.169]  I think?
[01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:38.655]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[01:04:38.695 --> 01:04:39.556]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[01:04:39.596 --> 01:04:39.936]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:04:39.956 --> 01:04:41.338]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:59.427]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:59.788 --> 01:05:07.398]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:08.109 --> 01:05:15.171]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:15.572 --> 01:05:26.975]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:27.295 --> 01:05:30.877]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:31.257 --> 01:05:33.217]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:33.538 --> 01:05:37.379]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:05:37.959 --> 01:05:44.971]  Get your copy today on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:05:51.354 --> 01:05:59.397]  Hi, this is Jeff Rents, and if you're interested in suppressed natural cures and rare exotic remedies, this may be the most important message you'll hear for a long time.
[01:05:59.797 --> 01:06:09.100]  There's an opportunity right now for a limited number of listeners to acquire an amazing, blacklisted, naturally occurring compound with very unusual ionic properties.
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:13.782]  In fact, it's considered the single most important remedy in all of Ayurvedic medicine.
[01:06:14.262 --> 01:06:26.350]  Medical studies have been conducted abroad on the effects this rare mineral-like compound has on energy, diabetes, tumors, ulcers, memory, and brain function, not to mention reproductive health, exercise recovery, and arthritis.
[01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:31.593]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made.
[01:06:31.974 --> 01:06:35.316]  However, it's still quite legal to own this compound, and the best part?
[01:06:35.696 --> 01:06:37.197]  My listeners pay nothing down.
[01:06:37.277 --> 01:06:39.659]  Simply go to blacklistedherb.com.
[01:06:39.679 --> 01:06:41.620]  That's blacklistedherb.com.
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:42.380]  Or call 815-259-4552.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.441]  That's 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:06:43.481 --> 01:06:44.401]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:44.521 --> 01:06:45.882]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:45.902 --> 01:06:46.402]  We're live.
[01:06:46.422 --> 01:06:46.782]  It's Thursday.
[01:07:12.984 --> 01:07:14.946]  The fourth day of October, 2007.
[01:07:14.986 --> 01:07:18.169]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:07:18.189 --> 01:07:20.651]  I want to thank all of our AM and FM affiliates.
[01:07:21.532 --> 01:07:24.715]  The Global Shortwave Affiliate, WWCR, doing a great job.
[01:07:26.577 --> 01:07:37.928]  Also, all the fine folks that make our internet streaming possible at InfoWars.com, TruthNews.us, JonesReport.com,
[01:07:39.562 --> 01:07:54.929]  I also want to thank all of my webmasters and everybody in the office from people that do bookkeeping, to the folks that ship the videos and books out, to my producer, everybody, I want to thank you for the great job you do and the courage you have working here.
[01:07:56.790 --> 01:08:01.512]  Just everything that everybody does, I want everybody to know I'm very thankful.
[01:08:03.757 --> 01:08:05.478]  For the support the listeners give us.
[01:08:05.518 --> 01:08:07.419]  We couldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[01:08:07.499 --> 01:08:12.302]  That's obvious, but I just want to state that again on record, that I am thankful.
[01:08:12.762 --> 01:08:14.423]  I'm thankful for my daily bread.
[01:08:14.443 --> 01:08:17.724]  I'm thankful for the air I breathe into my lungs.
[01:08:20.166 --> 01:08:25.689]  I can't say I'm thankful for having really bad ragweed allergies right now, but you know what?
[01:08:26.089 --> 01:08:28.130]  That is a small thing.
[01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:32.067]  We're good to go!
[01:08:55.658 --> 01:09:10.571]  MySpace friends your email list about the free podcast that serves up every day when the show ends in the hour after the show it serves out to I don't know it's got to be like 60-something thousand people now last time I looked at it that are taking it and
[01:09:11.371 --> 01:09:14.954]  Please, 60,000 of you out there listening, tell others about the podcast.
[01:09:15.255 --> 01:09:16.616]  That's how we reach more people.
[01:09:17.136 --> 01:09:21.060]  And don't forget, we also restream the show 24 hours a day.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:25.283]  We're live 11 to 2 Central, but then consecutively for 21 hours after.
[01:09:25.323 --> 01:09:32.350]  If you miss the first hour, the second hour, the third hour, you can tune in and listen to the streams consecutively at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:38.113]  I get emails all the time saying, I hear some other show, and I click on that.
[01:09:38.133 --> 01:09:39.734]  You've got to go to InfoWars.com.
[01:09:40.094 --> 01:09:43.557]  That's where my streams go out 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[01:09:43.897 --> 01:09:50.122]  Okay, I want to hurry up and go to Laura, Fred, Jeff, Joshua, John, and others that are holding.
[01:09:50.142 --> 01:09:53.445]  But let me try to answer Laura's really important question.
[01:09:55.447 --> 01:09:56.828]  Because I get this constantly.
[01:09:57.148 --> 01:09:59.490]  Okay, you claim the global elite.
[01:10:01.818 --> 01:10:05.922]  Want to reduce the world's population by 80% at least?
[01:10:07.102 --> 01:10:09.965]  Why would the global corporations want to do that?
[01:10:10.345 --> 01:10:15.609]  They quote, make so much money off of us, we're consumers that buy things.
[01:10:18.932 --> 01:10:22.995]  Similarly, people ask me, well why would the criminal government stage 9-11?
[01:10:23.035 --> 01:10:23.776]  What's the point?
[01:10:24.713 --> 01:10:33.775]  Well, the neocons have written memos saying we need terror attacks to galvanize the people to accept us invading all these nations and taking the oil.
[01:10:34.835 --> 01:10:37.756]  And having no-bid weapons contracts and getting the opium.
[01:10:38.676 --> 01:10:40.537]  Now flowing out of Afghanistan at record levels.
[01:10:40.557 --> 01:10:46.458]  I mean, that's why they've had national columnists and writers come out and say 9-11 was good, we need another one.
[01:10:47.651 --> 01:11:03.418]  That's why we have Republican memos people didn't believe two years ago, now confirmed to be real memos, with Republican party heads talking about it, and senators and former senators, I mean, saying, yeah, 9-11 was good, and there's gonna be another one, and then all you people that don't want a police state are gonna have to shut up!
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:09.741]  Why did Hitler fire bombers on Reichstag?
[01:11:10.081 --> 01:11:13.623]  Why did he attack his own radio station and blame them on the Poles?
[01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:16.804]  Because the Germans weren't going to attack Poland without some excuse.
[01:11:17.245 --> 01:11:18.985]  They had to sell the general public.
[01:11:22.187 --> 01:11:23.547]  Now, that's a simple answer.
[01:11:23.767 --> 01:11:36.413]  Her question, if you just look at the official economic theorem, geopolitical economic theorem, from any of the major camps, doesn't matter if it's McKinsey or
[01:11:37.998 --> 01:11:38.738]  It just doesn't matter.
[01:11:39.539 --> 01:11:44.000]  Or the Von Mies type Austrian school.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.521]  They all say, yeah, markets are dominant.
[01:11:46.581 --> 01:11:47.581]  Markets run everything.
[01:11:47.661 --> 01:11:49.142]  Markets control everything.
[01:11:49.802 --> 01:11:51.282]  Markets are unstoppable.
[01:11:51.362 --> 01:11:54.683]  You can't get in the way of markets.
[01:11:57.764 --> 01:11:59.505]  And to a certain extent, that's true.
[01:12:01.705 --> 01:12:06.607]  Unless you have cartels, which is another way of saying oligopolies.
[01:12:07.712 --> 01:12:25.237]  Groups of people, could be three, could be twenty, could be ten, companies, corporations, that get together and fix prices, or that get together and lobby government for laws that blocks any new competition from rising.
[01:12:28.938 --> 01:12:31.599]  The elite of the planet are monopoly men.
[01:12:31.799 --> 01:12:35.940]  Everything they do is about how to get a monopoly control
[01:12:36.904 --> 01:12:45.469]  Over construction, over technology, over sciences, over military power, over hydrogen weapons, over neutron weapons.
[01:12:46.829 --> 01:13:00.456]  Because if they can get a monopoly and use governmental control to enforce that monopoly, and regulation to enforce that monopoly, they don't have to worry about new elites challenging them, coming up for the middle class.
[01:13:00.777 --> 01:13:05.119]  They don't have to worry about being supplanted by revolutionary competition.
[01:13:07.637 --> 01:13:30.793]  Because they're monopoly men, and the ultimate expression of that, the ultimate monopoly, is to not just break up the family, and is to not just break up the nation-state so no nation can challenge the global body, or so no army or individual can challenge them.
[01:13:33.712 --> 01:13:44.019]  But the ultimate final expression is literally removing your competition, wiping them out, killing everyone who isn't part of your tribe.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.402]  And many tribes throughout history have practiced this.
[01:13:48.462 --> 01:13:55.807]  The Israelites, in the Old Testament, would go into an area and they would kill everyone.
[01:13:56.007 --> 01:13:58.128]  Every man, woman, and child.
[01:13:58.769 --> 01:13:59.649]  Every oxen.
[01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:02.271]  Every fowl.
[01:14:04.145 --> 01:14:10.268]  They would kill everyone, and then they never had to worry about fighting that tribe again.
[01:14:12.028 --> 01:14:17.151]  And they actually learned that from other tribes in the Middle East that practiced the same thing.
[01:14:19.072 --> 01:14:28.596]  And generally it was religiously driven, because the Africans generally didn't wipe out other tribes, they merged with other tribes, took them over, so they would be bigger and more powerful.
[01:14:29.296 --> 01:14:31.637]  Which is really historically a more reasonable system.
[01:14:33.337 --> 01:14:35.157]  That is not what the Middle Easterners did.
[01:14:35.418 --> 01:14:36.638]  They would kill everyone.
[01:14:37.018 --> 01:14:40.399]  And the Romans, if you resisted them, would kill your entire village.
[01:14:41.339 --> 01:14:53.042]  Whether it be in Gaul, or whether it be in Persia, whether it be in Albion, or when Jerusalem resisted them, they went in and killed everyone and tore down every building.
[01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:59.263]  So, it is the ultimate monopoly.
[01:14:59.981 --> 01:15:03.403]  It is the instinct of the elite to create monopolies.
[01:15:03.703 --> 01:15:08.245]  And if they get a world government, that is a monopoly of government where nothing can challenge it.
[01:15:08.626 --> 01:15:11.267]  They have a monopoly over oil through the OPEC cartel.
[01:15:12.248 --> 01:15:15.009]  They have monopolies now of force.
[01:15:15.609 --> 01:15:17.870]  That's what it's about, keeping other people from getting nukes.
[01:15:20.112 --> 01:15:25.314]  They have a monopoly over almost every nation in the world's issuance of currency and credit.
[01:15:25.595 --> 01:15:28.196]  And the private families own those shares.
[01:15:30.109 --> 01:15:48.358]  Now, that aside, it's also important to understand that even if you can't grasp why the elite want to kill the majority of the world's population, regardless, that's not where you start from in the debate.
[01:15:50.079 --> 01:15:59.064]  You say, okay, Alex claims in this UN document they say it will be the world government's policy to reduce the world population by at least eight-tenths.
[01:15:59.807 --> 01:16:05.792]  And you go to the Biological Diversity Assessment, codified in the International Treaty and Law, and you will read it.
[01:16:08.555 --> 01:16:15.801]  Or you go read the Autobahn Society Dated, where Ted Turner says he wants to get rid of 95% of people, and you will find it.
[01:16:16.682 --> 01:16:21.506]  Or you go and you look at what the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with over $70 billion in it now,
[01:16:23.519 --> 01:16:29.664]  From them, Warren Buffett, and others, is carrying out sterilization eugenics policies worldwide.
[01:16:30.705 --> 01:16:36.890]  See, then you find out that eugenics took over and started most of the modern sciences we see.
[01:16:38.051 --> 01:16:47.720]  So it's about, I make this incredible claim, and then it is presented in the film, the books, the publications, where they said it, and it's only a fraction.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.563]  We can't even put it more than maybe
[01:16:52.530 --> 01:16:54.671]  10% of the evidence I came across is in the film.
[01:16:56.993 --> 01:16:58.574]  That's why it'll no doubt be in Endgame 2.
[01:17:03.296 --> 01:17:11.561]  So, from a purely economic perspective though, trying to address your question, let me explain.
[01:17:12.942 --> 01:17:15.543]  Just as the father of Reaganomics explained last week,
[01:17:18.928 --> 01:17:23.110]  Chief Economist of the Treasury during Ronald Reagan's administration, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:17:23.531 --> 01:17:25.292]  We are not trading with China.
[01:17:27.073 --> 01:17:27.393]  U.S.
[01:17:27.453 --> 01:17:35.217]  companies left the U.S., they went to China, they built the factories there, and they know it's going to destroy this market in the end.
[01:17:35.638 --> 01:17:42.401]  That is the whole point, was it was about getting a oligopoly, the elite cartels in China,
[01:17:45.845 --> 01:17:56.569]  So it would knock out the middle class in Europe and the United States and destroy those factory bases, moving power out of the first world into the second world.
[01:17:58.089 --> 01:18:05.252]  And this is all stated in Carnegie and Murray Strong documents and UN documents and Rockefeller... I mean, this is all public!
[01:18:06.832 --> 01:18:08.813]  They said 30 years ago they were going to do this.
[01:18:10.793 --> 01:18:11.754]  More than 30 years.
[01:18:11.774 --> 01:18:13.054]  34 years ago.
[01:18:14.415 --> 01:18:15.175]  Man, I'm getting old.
[01:18:16.266 --> 01:18:17.867]  Hard to believe this much time has flown by.
[01:18:21.869 --> 01:18:22.690]  It's on record.
[01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:24.831]  It's to hurt you.
[01:18:25.391 --> 01:18:30.314]  They don't care if you take money they issue out of nothing and can buy some goods.
[01:18:32.035 --> 01:18:36.717]  All of this cheap Chinese goods was part of a process of bringing the U.S.
[01:18:36.757 --> 01:18:37.638]  to its knees.
[01:18:39.218 --> 01:18:41.039]  You ask, why would they want to break up the family?
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:45.702]  That's the stated policy of any command and control government.
[01:18:46.343 --> 01:18:49.464]  They want you to have allegiance to the state, not your family.
[01:18:51.045 --> 01:18:56.266]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:18:56.426 --> 01:19:04.509]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:19:04.769 --> 01:19:11.811]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:19:11.971 --> 01:19:12.911]  We're good to go!
[01:19:39.179 --> 01:19:40.840]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:19:42.261 --> 01:19:43.201]  Ted Anders from Midas.
[01:19:43.221 --> 01:19:43.861]  October 4th, 2007.
[01:19:44.041 --> 01:19:47.483]  Gold 723 10 ounce gold coins can be purchased for 745.72, 367.75 for half, 183.88 for quarter.
[01:19:47.523 --> 01:19:48.283]  That's 745.72, 367.75, and 183.88.
[01:20:07.072 --> 01:20:09.194]  The dollar has fallen to 65% of the euro.
[01:20:09.294 --> 01:20:10.295]  Erosion accelerates.
[01:20:10.375 --> 01:20:17.500]  Mainline talk show hosts are trying to hold on to the support of the conservative movement, keeping focus on the Republican agenda and playing into the hand of the globalists.
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.903]  Dr. Corsi interviewed Robert Pastor of the American University.
[01:20:21.043 --> 01:20:27.368]  With the sleight of hand and incremental implementation, Pastor admits to the North American Union is being forced upon us.
[01:20:27.828 --> 01:20:32.313]  Corsi uncovers the CFR's plan to build a North American community similar to the EU.
[01:20:32.633 --> 01:20:37.638]  In his report, the North American Union isn't going away, Corsi exposes the deception of trickery.
[01:20:37.758 --> 01:20:41.342]  Call for your report today, 800-686-2237.
[01:20:41.422 --> 01:20:44.565]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[01:20:44.686 --> 01:20:44.946]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:44.966 --> 01:20:45.146]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:50.803 --> 01:20:52.924]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[01:20:53.284 --> 01:20:56.345]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:20:56.605 --> 01:21:01.167]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:21:01.547 --> 01:21:04.168]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:21:04.688 --> 01:21:11.370]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:17.052]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:21:17.532 --> 01:21:19.152]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:21:19.693 --> 01:21:22.974]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:21:23.534 --> 01:21:26.895]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[01:21:26.935 --> 01:21:33.917]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[01:21:34.257 --> 01:21:39.659]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and shipping.
[01:21:39.999 --> 01:21:40.879]  Share the oil company
[01:21:40.879 --> 01:21:41.320]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:41.961]  That's 888-873-7371 today!
[01:21:50.729 --> 01:21:55.013]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:21:55.253 --> 01:22:00.157]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:22:00.358 --> 01:22:01.699]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:22:01.859 --> 01:22:05.262]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Cal Bend Pure Soaps?

[01:22:16.992 --> 01:22:19.414]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[01:22:19.494 --> 01:22:21.815]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.

[01:22:25.658 --> 01:22:26.598]  No animal testing.
[01:22:26.838 --> 01:22:27.899]  I use them and love them.
[01:22:28.179 --> 01:22:29.780]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.

[01:22:42.948 --> 01:22:49.471]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:03.076]  I've tried as best I can to answer your question, Laura.
[01:23:03.956 --> 01:23:06.177]  They don't care about making money.
[01:23:06.237 --> 01:23:07.097]  They print the money.
[01:23:07.597 --> 01:23:08.958]  They control the central banks.
[01:23:09.771 --> 01:23:12.272]  Everything they do is about global domination.
[01:23:12.312 --> 01:23:13.913]  It's about destroying competition.
[01:23:14.653 --> 01:23:18.415]  It's about going into China and making things cheaper than anybody in the world can make them.
[01:23:18.855 --> 01:23:25.698]  To knock out tens of thousands of factories owned by nouveau riche or new wealth.
[01:23:27.278 --> 01:23:35.502]  The elite has always waged war on the middle class because that's where threats to its hegemon or its domination come from.
[01:23:38.454 --> 01:23:46.858]  And the elite, of course, are extremely selfish, greedy, grasping.
[01:23:48.199 --> 01:23:56.363]  And it's the ultimate expression of a control freak that they're not drinking the fluoride water.
[01:23:57.063 --> 01:23:59.464]  They're not giving their children the mercury shots.
[01:24:01.685 --> 01:24:02.165]  We are.
[01:24:04.367 --> 01:24:05.187]  It's feudalism.
[01:24:06.337 --> 01:24:07.538]  No research that word.
[01:24:07.698 --> 01:24:08.178]  Serfdom.
[01:24:09.238 --> 01:24:12.640]  They are systems of control by the elite.
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:14.921]  Does that answer your question, Laura?
[01:24:15.521 --> 01:24:16.082]  Um, not.
[01:24:16.402 --> 01:24:16.842]  Not really.
[01:24:18.675 --> 01:24:35.008]  So I just stated to you that the elite openly say, in State Department Memorandum 200, that it is their policy to massively reduce the third world, and to pay off governments to do it, and to pay off China to have a one-child policy, to have less people.
[01:24:35.088 --> 01:24:36.209]  Yeah, the third world.
[01:24:36.829 --> 01:24:38.811]  But you're talking about here.
[01:24:39.887 --> 01:24:43.949]  And other places where there are large economies in the Western world.
[01:24:44.069 --> 01:24:48.551]  Well, have you heard the announcements about how they want to penalize people for having more than one child?
[01:24:48.931 --> 01:24:52.133]  About how they want to tax us for our carbon footprints?
[01:24:52.733 --> 01:24:54.274]  Let me just rephrase this, okay?
[01:24:55.335 --> 01:24:56.975]  I'm talking about the big picture.
[01:24:57.035 --> 01:24:59.076]  Even the banks that rule the world.
[01:25:00.037 --> 01:25:02.238]  They have to lend to make money.
[01:25:03.209 --> 01:25:05.631]  You're not listening.
[01:25:05.671 --> 01:25:06.231]  You're not listening.
[01:25:06.672 --> 01:25:10.335]  They have to lend in the past when they didn't have total monopoly.
[01:25:11.235 --> 01:25:12.977]  They only lend to get property.
[01:25:13.017 --> 01:25:14.998]  They only lend so you default.
[01:25:15.459 --> 01:25:16.920]  That's where they get their profits.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:18.701]  It's about control.
[01:25:19.522 --> 01:25:23.085]  Listen, IMF World Bank documents got released in 2002.
[01:25:23.665 --> 01:25:28.509]  And it was all about how they wanted to wreck economies so they could consolidate everything.
[01:25:28.529 --> 01:25:29.269]  Do you understand that?
[01:25:29.329 --> 01:25:31.131]  It's about total control.
[01:25:32.495 --> 01:25:37.397]  I know the government is doing that, and all the governments that are related to this government, okay?
[01:25:38.077 --> 01:25:43.240]  But where are they going to... Where's the opposing force to all this?
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.660]  There has to be one.
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.521]  Yeah, it's called UNI.
[01:25:47.181 --> 01:26:00.067]  No, I think there has to be a big economic, you know, opposition to, like, all these... These companies that are all over the world dealing with everything, you know?
[01:26:00.866 --> 01:26:03.287]  And there's a whole bunch of specialized companies.
[01:26:03.307 --> 01:26:08.328]  There's not like a monopoly on these things, and it would take a very long time for that to happen.
[01:26:08.348 --> 01:26:11.729]  No, there are monopolies over... I know there are monopolies, okay?
[01:26:11.789 --> 01:26:12.309]  I know that.
[01:26:12.509 --> 01:26:15.410]  Listen, if you control energy, you control the entire equation.
[01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:19.171]  Yeah, but this is the government you're still talking about, you know?
[01:26:19.531 --> 01:26:22.892]  I'm talking about... The government that says they... These companies, they're not part of the government.
[01:26:23.532 --> 01:26:24.472]  They need to make money.
[01:26:25.236 --> 01:26:27.077]  That's more important to them than anything.
[01:26:27.097 --> 01:26:28.357]  They're profits, as we know.
[01:26:28.678 --> 01:26:31.819]  Most of their, quote, profits are government contracts, and that's expanding.
[01:26:31.899 --> 01:26:35.241]  By the industrial, you know, what is it called?
[01:26:35.281 --> 01:26:36.621]  You know, this is what I'm telling you.
[01:26:36.962 --> 01:26:38.862]  The elite have stated what their plan is.
[01:26:38.922 --> 01:26:40.103]  They are doing this.
[01:26:40.923 --> 01:26:41.844]  Now, are you saying that?
[01:26:41.904 --> 01:26:43.525]  Is it true, or what are you saying?
[01:26:43.925 --> 01:26:49.988]  No, I believe that the elite have that exact idea.
[01:26:50.228 --> 01:26:52.709]  You know, I mean, they want to destroy the third world.
[01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:54.630]  They want to destroy all the Muslims.
[01:26:55.191 --> 01:26:55.711]  They do.
[01:26:56.591 --> 01:27:02.593]  But what about the opposing force of the, you know, rich economies around the world?
[01:27:03.033 --> 01:27:06.874]  And what about the federal income tax, where they get so much money from?
[01:27:06.894 --> 01:27:08.135]  Do you understand?
[01:27:09.335 --> 01:27:12.876]  Not one red cent of that income tax goes to run anything in the government.
[01:27:12.916 --> 01:27:14.436]  It's only on interest on the debt.
[01:27:14.777 --> 01:27:16.077]  It's a control mechanism.
[01:27:16.946 --> 01:27:26.208]  Yeah, everything is controlled, but you said that the banks don't make their money from interest, and I'm telling you, I can't, they have, they've always had total control over us.
[01:27:27.148 --> 01:27:29.789]  Listen, listen, ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[01:27:30.349 --> 01:27:32.649]  It sounds like I'm not going to be able to explain this to you.
[01:27:34.570 --> 01:27:36.610]  This is about total monopoly.
[01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:39.211]  Total centralization.
[01:27:40.851 --> 01:27:44.412]  The money the bank loans you is a fractional reserve equation.
[01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:45.392]  It isn't real.
[01:27:47.486 --> 01:27:51.547]  Okay, so when you pay them back interest, it isn't real.
[01:27:52.028 --> 01:27:59.650]  It's all meant to create economic conditions where they can then blow out whole economies and consolidate.
[01:27:59.970 --> 01:28:03.952]  And where they can get governments into debt where they are beholden under their control.
[01:28:04.312 --> 01:28:14.495]  We're going out of a phase of where they needed to use some free market systems to consolidate into a phase where they have almost total centralization and total control.
[01:28:16.036 --> 01:28:16.336]  Okay?
[01:28:17.722 --> 01:28:23.523]  And we have a global government that is already staging massive terror attacks and killing thousands of us at a pop.
[01:28:24.443 --> 01:28:29.864]  And we have top professors at every major university saying 80 plus percent of the public need to die.
[01:28:30.364 --> 01:28:32.505]  And that bio-weapons need to be released on us.
[01:28:33.385 --> 01:28:35.465]  And I'm just telling you we're in grave danger.
[01:28:36.185 --> 01:28:38.206]  And I'm sorry that it doesn't make sense to you.
[01:28:41.566 --> 01:28:42.527]  We're on the march.
[01:28:42.967 --> 01:28:44.467]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.462 --> 01:28:48.283]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:51.284 --> 01:28:51.564]  Hemp.
[01:28:51.784 --> 01:28:53.825]  The superfood for you and your family.
[01:28:54.225 --> 01:28:57.507]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[01:28:57.987 --> 01:28:58.247]  Hemp.
[01:28:58.647 --> 01:29:01.408]  Used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[01:29:01.768 --> 01:29:02.048]  Hemp.
[01:29:02.389 --> 01:29:08.831]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[01:29:09.191 --> 01:29:12.455]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[01:29:12.715 --> 01:29:16.579]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[01:29:16.919 --> 01:29:21.244]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments.
[01:29:21.604 --> 01:29:28.011]  Loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.
[01:29:28.311 --> 01:29:32.633]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[01:29:32.833 --> 01:29:34.694]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?
[01:29:34.954 --> 01:29:41.197]  Call today at 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[01:29:41.557 --> 01:29:44.859]  Learn, help, shop at hempusa.org.
[01:29:45.039 --> 01:29:46.120]  We do not charge for shipping.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:47.320]  That's 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[01:29:51.531 --> 01:29:53.913]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[01:29:54.433 --> 01:29:55.914]  After a pedicure they look great.
[01:29:56.275 --> 01:30:00.098]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[01:30:00.538 --> 01:30:02.740]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:06.503]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:30:06.903 --> 01:30:09.365]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:30:09.865 --> 01:30:10.906]  What's that name again?
[01:30:11.306 --> 01:30:12.487]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:30:12.888 --> 01:30:14.048]  It's CalX.
[01:30:14.449 --> 01:30:16.290]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:30:16.630 --> 01:30:18.472]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[01:30:19.272 --> 01:30:27.875]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:30:28.315 --> 01:30:34.018]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:30:34.418 --> 01:30:45.542]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, HEB grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:30:46.201 --> 01:30:47.302]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[01:30:47.643 --> 01:30:48.303]  I'll be right back.
[01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:50.185]  I'm getting some Calix for my heels.
[01:30:51.347 --> 01:30:56.632]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:30:57.073 --> 01:31:01.297]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:31:01.717 --> 01:31:08.585]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:09.005 --> 01:31:15.710]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:16.050 --> 01:31:17.651]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:31:17.952 --> 01:31:21.134]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:21.414 --> 01:31:23.876]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:31:24.176 --> 01:31:30.901]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:31.341 --> 01:31:34.022]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:31:34.282 --> 01:31:37.664]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll-free at 866-885-6625.
[01:31:37.704 --> 01:31:38.064]  That's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:38.124 --> 01:31:40.305]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[01:32:01.326 --> 01:32:11.413]  I'm also going to take some questions out of the live questions section of the Prison Planet Forum.
[01:32:12.434 --> 01:32:16.637]  And I just gave that lady 25 minutes trying to explain it to her.
[01:32:18.838 --> 01:32:20.059]  And hey, you're on the right path.
[01:32:20.079 --> 01:32:20.940]  You're looking for the truth.
[01:32:24.042 --> 01:32:28.645]  I mean, you at least understand that it's the Globalist's plan to do this.
[01:32:30.254 --> 01:32:34.337]  And they are targeting our population with eugenics programs.
[01:32:35.138 --> 01:32:37.219]  They've been doing it in this country for a long time.
[01:32:37.259 --> 01:32:41.242]  They sterilized more than 400,000 women in this country.
[01:32:41.743 --> 01:32:45.666]  Then they sterilized tens of thousands of Native American women after that in the 70s.
[01:32:46.527 --> 01:32:49.509]  There's been hundreds of other programs and other secret tests.
[01:32:50.710 --> 01:32:52.411]  They will just go on the New York subway.
[01:32:52.671 --> 01:32:54.332]  I use that case because everybody knows about it.
[01:32:54.372 --> 01:32:54.833]  It's famous.
[01:32:54.893 --> 01:32:56.234]  It's one of thousands that are admitted.
[01:32:57.254 --> 01:32:59.755]  In 1968, you just killed a bunch of people on the subway.
[01:32:59.795 --> 01:33:00.975]  Details remain classified.
[01:33:03.476 --> 01:33:04.837]  I mean, that's what they think of you.
[01:33:04.877 --> 01:33:06.217]  They're on power trips.
[01:33:06.237 --> 01:33:07.037]  You understand that?
[01:33:09.098 --> 01:33:22.823]  And Bill Joy, who's a multi-billionaire, co-founder and co-owner of Sun Microsystems, a $100 billion company, went to an elite meeting in 2000
[01:33:24.255 --> 01:33:33.238]  With over 200 top technology company owners and engineers, and they were there talking about how the elite planned to exterminate the public.
[01:33:34.178 --> 01:33:35.538]  So he went and wrote an article about it.
[01:33:35.759 --> 01:33:38.679]  This is all over the place when you start researching it, dear.
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:41.920]  I know it's crazy.
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:42.781]  It is nuts.
[01:33:44.601 --> 01:33:45.802]  But this is what they're doing.
[01:33:45.822 --> 01:33:46.622]  They have robotics.
[01:33:46.642 --> 01:33:48.362]  They have all this mechanization.
[01:33:48.822 --> 01:33:50.343]  They don't need us anymore.
[01:33:51.914 --> 01:33:52.755]  You understand that?
[01:33:53.095 --> 01:33:54.356]  Life has always been cheap.
[01:33:55.017 --> 01:33:58.860]  Now it is a negative to these people.
[01:34:00.181 --> 01:34:01.822]  They call it culling the herd.
[01:34:05.145 --> 01:34:09.148]  You know, Hitler planned to go all over the world and kill all the inferior races.
[01:34:09.188 --> 01:34:09.889]  You know that, right?
[01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:13.432]  He got that from British planners and U.S.
[01:34:13.472 --> 01:34:13.852]  planners.
[01:34:14.593 --> 01:34:16.434]  His guidebook was U.S.
[01:34:16.494 --> 01:34:19.677]  and British eugenicists publications.
[01:34:20.422 --> 01:34:23.284]  He says that in Mein Kampf, my struggle.
[01:34:25.706 --> 01:34:27.448]  Adolf A. Louis Hitler.
[01:34:30.590 --> 01:34:37.315]  And now we have people like Arnold A. Louis Schwarzenegger as our gubernator, our Gruppenfuhrer.
[01:34:41.359 --> 01:34:42.259]  Oh, heaven help us.
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:45.262]  Alright, Fred in Arkansas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:34:47.321 --> 01:34:50.325]  Thanks Alex, really looking forward to seeing Endgame.
[01:34:50.705 --> 01:34:53.308]  I'll be calling back tomorrow to place my advance order.
[01:34:53.328 --> 01:35:03.361]  I was watching TV and a couple of times I saw a new commercial for a movie, Rendition, which goes back to the torture.
[01:35:04.299 --> 01:35:27.926]  And I went to the renditionmovie.com site and if you click on the film info and then go to world view, it gives you the opportunity to watch an interview of Matt Lauer interviewing President Bush about his interrogation techniques, a speech by Condoleezza Rice on how rendition saves lives.
[01:35:30.897 --> 01:35:35.720]  A lot of information there in one spot to people that want to learn more about it.
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:45.765]  Now, by the way, rendition is you're walking down the street, a van pulls up, they throw a bag over your head and take you to Bulgaria and torture you for five years.
[01:35:46.426 --> 01:35:47.226]  Absolutely right.
[01:35:48.827 --> 01:35:50.268]  Well, that's what Christians do.
[01:35:51.048 --> 01:35:56.371]  And once you start doing that, why not torture children, which they do.
[01:35:57.312 --> 01:35:57.832]  I believe you.
[01:35:58.493 --> 01:36:00.154]  Oh, that's in the official government documents.
[01:36:00.174 --> 01:36:01.875]  See, that's the real target of these people.
[01:36:02.315 --> 01:36:08.298]  I've done my own research, and I don't believe you, because I've read it myself, because I didn't just take your word for it.
[01:36:08.458 --> 01:36:13.340]  I did what you told me, and I went and I researched it, and I found out you're exactly telling the truth.
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:15.721]  Have you read the Army Zone report on it?
[01:36:16.281 --> 01:36:17.422]  Now, that I have to say, no.
[01:36:17.442 --> 01:36:19.843]  There's type Army Report on Torture.
[01:36:20.786 --> 01:36:25.307]  And then Chigumbu, because he's a... Neocons make fun of that name.
[01:36:25.347 --> 01:36:27.248]  He's a Filipino-American two-star general.
[01:36:27.748 --> 01:36:32.850]  He ran the finding, and it's even a whitewash, but admits they killed people and tortured them to death.
[01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:37.991]  And then they admit 95% of those taken to the camps in Iraq totally innocent.
[01:36:38.371 --> 01:36:40.332]  They just randomly scooped the males up.
[01:36:41.132 --> 01:36:45.393]  And then they give them no rights to legal counsel of any type.
[01:36:45.493 --> 01:36:49.015]  They don't tell anybody where they are, where they're being held.
[01:36:49.575 --> 01:36:50.355]  It's totally wrong.
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:54.601]  Well, they also pose with the dead bodies like it's a trophy.
[01:36:57.162 --> 01:36:58.202]  Scary stuff, Alex.
[01:36:59.182 --> 01:37:02.103]  Well, they can't wait to have their way with us here domestically.
[01:37:02.744 --> 01:37:05.925]  Well, I'm not going to go down easy.
[01:37:09.386 --> 01:37:09.866]  I hear you.
[01:37:09.926 --> 01:37:10.466]  Anything else?
[01:37:10.946 --> 01:37:11.286]  No, sir.
[01:37:11.306 --> 01:37:12.247]  Keep up the good work.
[01:37:12.727 --> 01:37:13.767]  I appreciate your call.
[01:37:14.807 --> 01:37:19.509]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in San Francisco.
[01:37:19.569 --> 01:37:19.869]  Welcome.
[01:37:21.167 --> 01:37:22.107]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:37:22.167 --> 01:37:22.387]  Good.
[01:37:23.407 --> 01:37:29.309]  Okay, have you seen the new propaganda they're putting out trying to say how Blackwater's helping out now in Iraq?
[01:37:31.269 --> 01:37:34.490]  Yeah, I mean Blackwater has gotten 700 million dollars.
[01:37:35.110 --> 01:37:44.892]  Blackwater is a total neocon operation and they're in trouble for reportedly smuggling weapons to the insurgency.
[01:37:45.832 --> 01:37:46.612]  They're in trouble.
[01:37:47.992 --> 01:37:50.353]  For all sorts of things, but they're the future of warfare.
[01:37:50.393 --> 01:37:55.894]  Just open mercenaries who get 30 grand a month when the soldiers get 30 grand a year if they're lucky.
[01:37:56.874 --> 01:38:00.175]  And even when the Iraqi president says leave, our government says no.
[01:38:00.375 --> 01:38:02.935]  Again, showing that it's a total puppet government.
[01:38:03.615 --> 01:38:10.657]  And even when they finally say you gotta get rid of them, the other contractors say they're bad, the military says they're bad, they're getting our soldiers killed.
[01:38:11.597 --> 01:38:15.198]  But they use black water in New Orleans, and they're gonna use it in America.
[01:38:16.190 --> 01:38:28.277]  And, uh, I mean, yeah, I've seen the propaganda about how sweet and loving Blackwater is, and really, they're a bunch of fat guys with goatees, strutting around acting tough, who are so afraid they just fired anything and everything.
[01:38:29.017 --> 01:38:29.898]  Yeah, totally.
[01:38:30.358 --> 01:38:39.703]  Um, another thing I wanted to ask you, um, I listen to your show a lot, and, um, I like the bumpers that you guys play, um, the music, and I know a lot of it's, uh, has a message in it.
[01:38:40.363 --> 01:38:45.126]  I was wondering if, um, I don't know if you maybe could, like, put together, like, a,
[01:38:46.690 --> 01:39:00.017]  Maybe a CD where you play the music and then explain what the artist was trying to explain and maybe that way would be a good way we could download that stuff and print it out and give it to people as a gateway to wanting to learn the truth.
[01:39:00.217 --> 01:39:00.778]  That kind of thing.
[01:39:02.399 --> 01:39:03.539]  That's a really good idea.
[01:39:03.559 --> 01:39:05.000]  I just wish I had time to do it.
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:06.981]  I didn't have time to floss this morning.
[01:39:07.001 --> 01:39:09.422]  I appreciate your call.
[01:39:12.423 --> 01:39:13.883]  You know, it's hard to say no to things.
[01:39:13.903 --> 01:39:15.784]  You know, it's hard to say no to radio interviews.
[01:39:16.364 --> 01:39:19.424]  It's hard to say no to TV interviews and you're there for three and a half hours.
[01:39:20.284 --> 01:39:21.385]  It's hard to say no.
[01:39:23.325 --> 01:39:24.585]  But I have to learn to say no.
[01:39:26.866 --> 01:39:35.887]  What I like is what people like who have the YouTube channel, the fella, or maybe a woman, I don't know who it is, The Gatekeeper Invasion.
[01:39:37.788 --> 01:39:38.568]  That's the name
[01:39:39.569 --> 01:39:44.433]  Of his YouTube channel, and that guy is a great video editor, great artist, really smart.
[01:39:45.054 --> 01:39:58.045]  There's so much hard work, must be three or four hours of work a day, putting videos together with our material, and I want to thank he or she, and salute them for the work they're doing, and there's literally hundreds of other people doing great work on YouTube.
[01:39:59.166 --> 01:40:05.372]  I mean, if you think there's a message to that music we play, grab the little bumpers, make your own comments, and put it out, folks.
[01:40:07.225 --> 01:40:09.647]  I'm not whining, I just can't do anymore.
[01:40:10.287 --> 01:40:16.212]  And I like your ideas, I like the recommendations you give me, and the way you put it was in a nice spirit.
[01:40:16.692 --> 01:40:23.198]  A lot of other folks call me and say, I want, or email me, I want you to document everything you've gotten in game.
[01:40:24.399 --> 01:40:31.624]  I want every document, every photo, and every quote you've got documented, and I want it on the web right now.
[01:40:34.486 --> 01:40:35.107]  I demand it!
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:41.602]  I could barely finish Endgame, financially and time and energy.
[01:40:42.923 --> 01:40:44.204]  It was a Herculean effort.
[01:40:45.644 --> 01:40:50.967]  Three people principally worked on that film, and then a few others did some other work.
[01:40:51.808 --> 01:40:52.748]  The graphics and things.
[01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:56.630]  And guess what?
[01:40:57.231 --> 01:41:04.795]  You gotta take my enjoyment, my pleasure, in presenting something, but we are creating a bibliography for the film.
[01:41:05.635 --> 01:41:07.056]  We've been doing that for the last month.
[01:41:07.722 --> 01:41:12.244]  I'm looking at Aaron Dykes out the window trying to do five other duties and that right now.
[01:41:12.444 --> 01:41:24.788]  I don't have the money and I don't have the people and if I did have the money you can't find enough people that actually are into research and they want to drink coffee and talk about conspiracies and be part of some rock and roll band.
[01:41:25.028 --> 01:41:26.289]  This isn't a rock and roll band.
[01:41:26.509 --> 01:41:28.749]  This is very hard work.
[01:41:35.632 --> 01:41:35.852]  So
[01:41:36.792 --> 01:41:37.612]  We are doing that.
[01:41:38.332 --> 01:41:46.875]  We are putting together for EndgameMovie.com, WhatIsTheEndgame.com, that's the two different URLs, goes to the same site.
[01:41:47.275 --> 01:41:48.055]  We are doing that.
[01:41:49.075 --> 01:41:57.738]  But that was done with martial law by a wonderful listener who offered to do it and did an incredible job.
[01:41:58.258 --> 01:42:05.400]  And that website sits there with every article, every document, every claim we make with the time code second.
[01:42:05.962 --> 01:42:09.723]  With the exact document or article or photo for you.
[01:42:10.684 --> 01:42:12.224]  It took him months to do it.
[01:42:12.644 --> 01:42:13.845]  I didn't have the money to do it.
[01:42:13.945 --> 01:42:14.745]  He just did it.
[01:42:16.986 --> 01:42:20.067]  So, I mean, think about if you were trying to do all of this.
[01:42:21.367 --> 01:42:23.628]  People seem to think I'm like in some ivory tower.
[01:42:23.728 --> 01:42:30.850]  I'm literally in a converted old auto repair garage that has been here since the twenties.
[01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:33.051]  I'm in a cinder block building.
[01:42:37.034 --> 01:42:38.955]  That bugs and mice get into.
[01:42:38.975 --> 01:42:47.358]  I haven't changed the oil in my car for probably 10,000, 15,000 miles because I hadn't had time.
[01:42:53.540 --> 01:42:54.221]  It doesn't matter.
[01:42:56.842 --> 01:42:59.903]  What I like is those that are out there taking action themselves.
[01:43:03.112 --> 01:43:04.873]  And I literally know this is life and death.
[01:43:04.913 --> 01:43:07.635]  I mean, I do this because I know these are hardcore killers we're fighting.
[01:43:08.395 --> 01:43:11.777]  I work hard because I know the time is short and the enemy's moving against us right now.
[01:43:15.839 --> 01:43:20.982]  And I see all these other lazy patriots and truthers who just, they want to be rock stars, a lot of them.
[01:43:21.682 --> 01:43:27.445]  And they just sit around for all the wrong reasons and they whine and they hate whoever's successful and whoever gets the word out.
[01:43:27.646 --> 01:43:30.187]  Believe me, I wish you weren't lazy.
[01:43:31.448 --> 01:43:33.109]  I wish you were truly taking action.
[01:43:35.130 --> 01:43:36.891]  Because we need to stop these people.
[01:43:37.711 --> 01:43:38.131]  Badly.
[01:43:39.112 --> 01:43:41.093]  We need to take action.
[01:43:42.613 --> 01:43:44.374]  We need to defeat the New World Order.
[01:43:50.997 --> 01:43:51.677]  Who's up next?
[01:43:54.819 --> 01:43:56.520]  Joshua, North Carolina, go ahead.
[01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:58.040]  Hey!
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:43:59.021]  Hey, Alex.
[01:43:59.762 --> 01:44:02.963]  I just wanted to first, of course, thank you for all your effort.
[01:44:03.063 --> 01:44:09.846]  I am an internet listener and I do tell all my family and everyone I can about you and that sort of stuff.
[01:44:09.946 --> 01:44:27.294]  But what I wanted to bring up specifically was a little bit of history that is less discussed these days about the Civil War and the fact that before the North came up with their idea to free their slaves with, you know, the whole 8 to 1 thing,
[01:44:27.694 --> 01:44:35.598]  There was a push by the South to free them with a one-to-one electoral vote that got voted down because the North controlled the Senate.
[01:44:35.918 --> 01:44:43.422]  Look, I've got the essays, the letters, the publications that he wrote for newspapers on Lincoln.
[01:44:43.502 --> 01:44:44.922]  It was never about slavery.
[01:44:44.942 --> 01:44:47.163]  It had nothing to do with slavery.
[01:44:47.503 --> 01:44:50.525]  He kept saying he'd put the Union back together and keep slavery.
[01:44:51.267 --> 01:44:51.688]  Exactly.
[01:44:51.708 --> 01:44:55.897]  It was about who was going to control Western representatives and the government.
[01:44:56.738 --> 01:45:02.890]  Who was going to control, exactly, trade laws, who was going to control the Electoral College, and the British.
[01:45:03.849 --> 01:45:19.773]  had tried, when Andrew Jackson was president, they had tried at the end of his second term to foment the South over a tax on tobacco and cotton to foment it, and Jackson found out the British were funding it and stopped it, and he was a Southerner, by the way.
[01:45:20.594 --> 01:45:23.794]  But he said, after I'm dead, the British are going to do this again.
[01:45:23.814 --> 01:45:28.276]  And he begged everybody, even on his deathbed, he said, they're going to start a war with the South.
[01:45:28.416 --> 01:45:32.797]  So I had family in the South, what you'd call a Texas Southerner,
[01:45:33.317 --> 01:45:45.349]  That family killed during Reconstruction, but the Southerners don't like to hear that they were rooked, they were scammed, they were taken by the good old Union Jackboys and their black-op intelligence.
[01:45:45.790 --> 01:45:48.052]  A little too sophisticated for the hayseeds down here.
[01:45:48.072 --> 01:45:54.979]  And it doesn't matter if the Southerners killed 301 in their fights, and it isn't taken away from their valiance and all this.
[01:45:55.659 --> 01:45:57.081]  The point is, it was a big scam.
[01:45:58.402 --> 01:46:16.238]  Totally and I completely agree with you and that's the thing that you know a lot of people these days don't know and since they wrote the history books isn't taught in the schools and it bugs me so I mean you can go out there and you can go to libraries and universities and read this stuff for yourselves and find out about it and it's all true but
[01:46:17.290 --> 01:46:19.832]  They've been doing this for a very long time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:19.892 --> 01:46:21.073]  This is not a new thing.
[01:46:21.393 --> 01:46:26.137]  They may call it a new world order, but this has been going on, and it's more like an old world order.
[01:46:26.537 --> 01:46:30.621]  It's just never been so public, but I mean, you know, the human race evolves.
[01:46:30.801 --> 01:46:34.824]  They've had all this time, and it's obviously evolved into a very nasty, evil beast.
[01:46:36.265 --> 01:46:36.845]  I agree with you.
[01:46:36.925 --> 01:46:37.826]  Very elegant.
[01:46:37.866 --> 01:46:38.667]  I appreciate your call.
[01:46:38.707 --> 01:46:39.187]  Anything else?
[01:46:40.188 --> 01:46:40.809]  Um, nope.
[01:46:40.909 --> 01:46:46.353]  That's all I'd like to say, except keep up the good fight, and I'll continue to do my best, and vote Ron Paul.
[01:46:46.875 --> 01:46:47.816]  Thank you so much.
[01:46:48.636 --> 01:46:50.517]  John in South Dakota, go ahead.
[01:46:53.799 --> 01:46:54.579]  San Diego.
[01:46:54.599 --> 01:46:56.200]  Okay, I saw SD on the screen.
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:58.061]  I'm out of it today, folks.
[01:46:58.081 --> 01:46:59.702]  Go ahead in San Diego.
[01:47:00.122 --> 01:47:08.006]  Yeah, let me, first I want to congratulate you on the graphics and music that are coming together on your website are great.
[01:47:08.746 --> 01:47:09.467]  I really enjoy
[01:47:10.427 --> 01:47:14.669]  Like a little introduction before you get in here, like weekly reports and stuff.
[01:47:14.729 --> 01:47:18.671]  So just from an artistic standpoint, it's just great to see that happening.
[01:47:21.253 --> 01:47:23.934]  The other thing I'd like to talk about is Blackwater here in San Diego.
[01:47:23.994 --> 01:47:35.880]  There is a 800 acre site in East San Diego, about two or three miles from the border in Mexico, that they are looking to make into a new training station.
[01:47:37.021 --> 01:47:37.401]  And this
[01:47:38.464 --> 01:47:43.347]  This weekend, there's going to be some protests from the San Diego Coalition for Peace and Justice.
[01:47:43.367 --> 01:47:47.330]  You can go to their website and check out the activities October 6th and 7th.
[01:47:49.071 --> 01:47:52.994]  Bob Filner, the representative, will be there to speak.
[01:47:53.194 --> 01:47:58.057]  He's the direct opposite of Duncan Hunter, who pretty much supports Blackwater.
[01:47:58.978 --> 01:48:03.101]  I took a ride out there, and it's just a beautiful country.
[01:48:03.481 --> 01:48:06.023]  To see it just be destroyed by
[01:48:06.792 --> 01:48:15.059]  I've seen a lot of video of them and mainly, and I'm not knocking them, I'm overweight too, but they're about 50 pounds overweight, devil goatees, stomping around acting tough.
[01:48:30.695 --> 01:48:32.416]  And, A, a real warrior doesn't do that.
[01:48:32.576 --> 01:48:37.439]  Thugs who want to act tough and scare people act like that, and they're into being tough.
[01:48:37.459 --> 01:48:40.321]  But I've seen video of them when their guts are blown out and they're crying for mama.
[01:48:41.482 --> 01:48:47.646]  Yeah, well, anything to get that type of activity out of any neighborhood here.
[01:48:47.666 --> 01:48:49.087]  It scares me if we have another wildfire.
[01:48:49.127 --> 01:48:53.089]  Well, they've got another one of those, you know, fake right-wing Christians.
[01:48:53.149 --> 01:48:54.450]  They're not right-wing.
[01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:55.331]  They're not Christian.
[01:48:55.811 --> 01:48:57.172]  It's all fake that runs it.
[01:48:58.155 --> 01:49:25.969]  and uh... it's it's just that that's uh... a country in total decline huge merc armies uh... the uh... military is going is already a massive percentage is illegal aliens or aggravated felons and that's what we're going to have illegal alien aggravated felons commanded by guys with devil tattoos running around with devil goatees led by a fruit loop christian zionist alright Alex, thanks, take care you got anything else?
[01:49:27.367 --> 01:49:30.150]  Just, I'm an architect for 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:49:30.210 --> 01:49:32.953]  I've had a few phone calls from people asking me to take them to lunch.
[01:49:32.973 --> 01:49:35.876]  So, I just tell them, just stay local.
[01:49:36.256 --> 01:49:38.579]  Take care of your family and friends and neighborhood first.
[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:40.001]  That's most important.
[01:49:40.021 --> 01:49:40.401]  I hear you.
[01:49:40.441 --> 01:49:43.625]  More calls straight ahead from Mike in Wyoming and others.
[01:49:43.705 --> 01:49:44.185]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.656 --> 01:49:56.838]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:57.178 --> 01:49:59.119]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:49:59.479 --> 01:50:07.143]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:07.823 --> 01:50:14.866]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:15.267 --> 01:50:22.190]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:22.651 --> 01:50:26.652]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:26.992 --> 01:50:30.693]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:30.973 --> 01:50:32.873]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:33.213 --> 01:50:37.134]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:57.941 --> 01:52:05.849]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[01:52:06.349 --> 01:52:13.951]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs, two books that combined are over a thousand pages and other information.
[01:52:14.251 --> 01:52:17.372]  Order now at our website mostholyfamilymonastery.com.
[01:52:17.572 --> 01:52:21.553]  That's mostholyfamilymonastery.com.
[01:52:21.814 --> 01:52:25.715]  The last word monastery is spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y.
[01:52:26.035 --> 01:52:26.495]  Or call us at 1-800-275-1126.
[01:52:26.515 --> 01:52:26.715]  That's 1-800-275-1126.
[01:52:33.957 --> 01:52:34.397]  Bottom Line!
[01:53:06.227 --> 01:53:08.729]  We have a criminal elite in control of our nation.
[01:53:08.769 --> 01:53:10.070]  They say it's terror attacks.
[01:53:10.831 --> 01:53:13.073]  They talk about how human life is completely worthless.
[01:53:14.153 --> 01:53:17.656]  They're setting up a world government to blot out any resistance.
[01:53:18.337 --> 01:53:26.223]  But the good news is people across the globe at an accelerated rate are waking up to the true threat to humanity.
[01:53:27.664 --> 01:53:32.508]  And I'm just honored, blessed beyond belief, to be at the very tip of the spear.
[01:53:33.274 --> 01:53:38.358]  In the fight against the New World Order, and I ask God every day to lead, guide, and direct me in the work I do.
[01:53:38.378 --> 01:53:44.043]  All right, let's continue with the phone calls, as promised today.
[01:53:44.944 --> 01:53:46.465]  Mike in Wyoming, you're on the air.
[01:53:46.525 --> 01:53:46.885]  Welcome.
[01:53:48.126 --> 01:53:48.667]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:49.067 --> 01:53:49.387]  Hi.
[01:53:50.488 --> 01:53:53.110]  A little more on the topic of Blackwater.
[01:53:53.130 --> 01:54:01.157]  I was watching, or kind of half-watching TV the other day, and there was a kind of ticker tape
[01:54:01.690 --> 01:54:05.153]  Well, it does, and I've got stacks of news here today.
[01:54:05.173 --> 01:54:08.016]  I think it's to the point where I don't even cover most of it.
[01:54:08.036 --> 01:54:08.717]  It's on the websites.
[01:54:25.012 --> 01:54:35.082]  Where people who are in investigations in the military keep riding home saying, look, they say they're going to kill me if I died in suicide, and a day later they blow their own head off.
[01:54:35.823 --> 01:54:37.765]  I mean, they've killed a whole bunch of investigators.
[01:54:37.845 --> 01:54:46.173]  And yeah, notice that the FBI, I saw that, has to be protected from Blackwater, from the mercenaries.
[01:54:49.564 --> 01:54:53.585]  Follow up on the lady that you spent quite a bit of time with.
[01:54:54.005 --> 01:54:55.846]  It seemed like you all weren't on the same wavelength.
[01:54:57.106 --> 01:55:00.207]  Her question is basically, why aren't there more Bill Joys?
[01:55:01.147 --> 01:55:12.370]  At some point, as you go down the Forbes 500, you're bound to find some people who find the New World Order more of a minus than a plus.
[01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:16.271]  And why aren't these guys getting organized and doing something?
[01:55:18.183 --> 01:55:23.267]  Well, that's why the elite spend so much time trying to get people who are in the power structure to join them.
[01:55:24.167 --> 01:55:31.052]  And, you know, the CFR has got 4,000 members now in the U.S., and only the inner committees have a bigger, you know, piece of the picture.
[01:55:31.713 --> 01:55:37.297]  And they kind of have laudable goals on the surface, and that's to keep people kind of in their huddle.
[01:55:38.024 --> 01:55:43.287]  I wouldn't say that the whole Fortune 500 leadership knows about this game plan.
[01:55:44.188 --> 01:55:48.151]  More and more of them are waking up to it, but I guess it's up to us to educate them.
[01:55:49.852 --> 01:55:53.814]  I mean, this is certainly something that cannot stand exposure.
[01:55:53.834 --> 01:55:56.176]  I mean, look, we have the SPP documents.
[01:55:56.216 --> 01:55:58.257]  We know the North American Union is merging right now.
[01:55:58.297 --> 01:55:58.957]  It's all happening.
[01:55:59.538 --> 01:56:01.899]  And you still get the establishment saying it doesn't exist.
[01:56:01.939 --> 01:56:02.520]  You see what I mean?
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:03.020]  Right.
[01:56:06.488 --> 01:56:18.158]  Yeah, you talk to a lot of these CEOs, they're experts on their company and their type of computer chip or whatever they sell, but then you ask them, they're between a Wahhabist and a Shiite, they don't know.
[01:56:18.298 --> 01:56:19.959]  So, you see what I mean?
[01:56:19.999 --> 01:56:21.561]  A lot of these rich people are specialized.
[01:56:22.742 --> 01:56:26.245]  And you think a Fortune 500 list, you know, I think that's big.
[01:56:27.005 --> 01:56:33.771]  Well, we know that the Fortune 500, that's a whole tier below the true elite who've had their money secret for a hundred years.
[01:56:34.676 --> 01:56:35.756]  Yeah, you remember H.G.
[01:56:35.856 --> 01:56:50.699]  Wells wrote The Open Conspiracy, and he expected that a couple decades ago, they'd be at the point where they wouldn't even have to issue denials or pretend that they were doing something other than what they were actually doing.
[01:56:50.739 --> 01:56:57.900]  And I think in their demented minds, some of them actually believe that this is all somehow for the best.
[01:56:58.481 --> 01:56:59.121]  Oh no, they do!
[01:56:59.141 --> 01:57:00.201]  They think they're saving the earth!
[01:57:01.861 --> 01:57:05.163]  Hey, Mike, you used to be in Arizona, didn't you?
[01:57:05.444 --> 01:57:05.624]  Right.
[01:57:06.224 --> 01:57:07.425]  So you've moved to Wyoming?
[01:57:07.725 --> 01:57:08.666]  Yeah, a small town.
[01:57:08.866 --> 01:57:13.069]  I've got a newspaper here that will actually publish my editorials.
[01:57:13.870 --> 01:57:15.431]  And you're a medical doctor, too, aren't you?
[01:57:15.911 --> 01:57:16.091]  Right.
[01:57:16.572 --> 01:57:18.453]  You've been calling for about, what, eight, nine years, I think?
[01:57:18.813 --> 01:57:19.053]  Uh-huh.
[01:57:19.274 --> 01:57:20.074]  Well, stay there.
[01:57:20.094 --> 01:57:25.058]  I'm going to come back in 60 seconds and then let you finish up your statement about H.G.
[01:57:25.098 --> 01:57:26.639]  Wells and the elites you've been in mind.
[01:57:26.939 --> 01:57:27.539]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:28.400]  Third hour, straight ahead.
[01:57:30.313 --> 01:57:35.157]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:35.197 --> 01:57:35.657]  Big Brother.
[01:57:35.677 --> 01:57:36.578]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:36.798 --> 01:57:38.700]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:41.242]  You want answers?
[01:57:53.587 --> 01:57:54.508]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:54.528 --> 01:57:58.770]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:59.331 --> 01:58:03.433]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:05.515 --> 01:58:14.200]  Coming up in this hour, I'm going to play a few minutes of excerpts from The Shooter, a film six months ago that Paul Watson wrote a review of.
[01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:21.765]  It's a total anti-New World Order movie with Mark Wahlberg becoming quite a distinguished actor.
[01:58:23.972 --> 01:58:28.395]  And, uh, we're also gonna get into that veteran who pulled down the Mexican flag.
[01:58:29.136 --> 01:58:36.220]  And I noticed that on the Digg comments, 80% or more of people were like, That veteran's horrible!
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:37.161]  He's evil!
[01:58:37.401 --> 01:58:39.182]  He's violating the First Amendment!
[01:58:39.582 --> 01:58:42.604]  So what if they flew a Mexican flag above the American flag?
[01:58:44.506 --> 01:58:45.747]  He needs to be arrested!
[01:58:46.687 --> 01:58:47.708]  That's not the issue.
[01:58:49.469 --> 01:58:52.351]  Obviously, you know, I said that I wouldn't have pulled it down.
[01:58:53.530 --> 01:58:56.592]  And I wouldn't have been out there with a knife saying, come on out here, I want to fight you.
[01:58:57.852 --> 01:58:59.693]  But I understand the anger.
[01:59:01.534 --> 01:59:13.960]  The illegal aliens have been running all over the country, pulling down American flags, stomping on them at government buildings, post offices, public schools, and running up the Mexican flag.
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:18.142]  And it was done militarily to say, this is Mexico, we've conquered you.
[01:59:19.642 --> 01:59:25.024]  It isn't that it's just some cloth and some dye, some color, as people said.
[01:59:25.965 --> 01:59:28.546]  It's that it's a complete and total affront.
[01:59:28.826 --> 01:59:31.187]  It's saying, we've captured you, we've dominated you.
[01:59:31.607 --> 01:59:33.027]  It's what it symbolizes.
[01:59:33.608 --> 01:59:39.490]  Now, I would have just had protest of it and shown video of it and leave it up there all you want.
[01:59:39.510 --> 01:59:45.152]  In fact, I tell the LaRica on Keystone that I hate this country, go ahead, fly your Mexican flags above the American flag.
[01:59:45.812 --> 01:59:47.013]  Show us what you're all about.
[01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:50.701]  All right, I digress.
[01:59:50.781 --> 02:00:00.168]  Mike in Wyoming was talking about a lady in the last hour who couldn't understand why the elite would want to get rid of the majority of the population if, quote, we buy their goods.
[02:00:01.108 --> 02:00:04.170]  Buying their goods is a very small piece of all of this.
[02:00:04.811 --> 02:00:07.273]  And regardless, the elites say they want to do this.
[02:00:07.653 --> 02:00:09.154]  Top professors in every major
[02:00:10.849 --> 02:00:12.590]  Yeah, I think these people are just self-absorbed.
[02:00:36.567 --> 02:00:47.092]  They've sold themselves on their own great plans that they can't imagine any of us not wanting to go along with it.
[02:00:48.252 --> 02:00:50.873]  You remember about Bob Bearer's book, See No Evil?
[02:00:52.574 --> 02:00:53.655]  The former CIA guy?
[02:00:53.915 --> 02:00:54.195]  Yes.
[02:00:54.635 --> 02:00:56.336]  By the way, he is a 9-11 truther.
[02:00:56.816 --> 02:01:00.758]  The folks that put out my films now publish his book, but he's scared to come on.
[02:01:01.898 --> 02:01:02.839]  In the foreword to his book,
[02:01:04.213 --> 02:01:18.516]  Tells a little story about talking to a journalist friend of his who had interviewed, off the record, a very high CIA guy, well above Bayer, which probably means a deputy director or director.
[02:01:19.256 --> 02:01:32.118]  And this person told the journalist that, you know, people in the future, you know, 9-11 will be seen as a great victory and not a failure.
[02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:37.421]  So, you know, these people just don't think like us.
[02:01:37.441 --> 02:01:44.962]  I mean, I don't know what's gone wrong with their circuitry, but... Did you see the... Well, they're drunk on power.
[02:01:45.263 --> 02:01:45.843]  Yeah.
[02:01:46.003 --> 02:01:47.063]  And they're in love with themselves.
[02:01:47.663 --> 02:02:01.626]  Did you see, which is when you really start getting stupid, when you think you know everything, did you see the letter last week, the chilling letter from Gary Hart, where he just basically spells out, hey, we staged terror, Iran, don't think the people won't get behind a war?
[02:02:02.529 --> 02:02:06.451]  Yeah, that was about as subtle as a lead balloon.
[02:02:08.452 --> 02:02:09.013]  That's helpful.
[02:02:09.193 --> 02:02:09.853]  And you're right.
[02:02:09.893 --> 02:02:12.895]  The cockiness of these people is our best ally.
[02:02:12.915 --> 02:02:14.716]  Well, Mike, have you noticed... Stay there.
[02:02:14.736 --> 02:02:15.936]  I want to talk with you some more about this.
[02:02:16.237 --> 02:02:21.479]  And I promise we're going to get to Joe and Bill and Sean and Joe and everybody else.
[02:02:21.539 --> 02:02:25.942]  But have you noticed now that... Well, I'm going to make this point when we get back.
[02:02:25.962 --> 02:02:27.903]  This is a really important point.
[02:02:28.502 --> 02:02:29.983]  And then I'll start accelerating your calls.
[02:02:30.023 --> 02:02:31.424]  I just always like it when Mike calls.
[02:02:31.444 --> 02:02:32.664]  He only calls about three times a year.
[02:02:33.465 --> 02:02:37.227]  Alright, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWorks.net are some of the websites.
[02:02:37.287 --> 02:02:39.268]  The new one is TruthNews.us.
[02:02:42.481 --> 02:02:43.262]  Terrorism!
[02:02:43.402 --> 02:02:44.162]  Terrorism!
[02:02:44.262 --> 02:02:50.326]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:02:50.586 --> 02:02:52.167]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:02:52.427 --> 02:02:54.888]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:02:55.268 --> 02:03:09.857]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:03:09.897 --> 02:03:10.217]  government.
[02:03:10.377 --> 02:03:12.158]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:03:12.558 --> 02:03:18.461]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:03:18.601 --> 02:03:23.104]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[02:03:45.659 --> 02:03:50.448]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:50.809 --> 02:03:58.422]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:59.133 --> 02:04:06.176]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:06.596 --> 02:04:17.981]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:18.321 --> 02:04:21.883]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:22.263 --> 02:04:24.184]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:24.544 --> 02:04:28.386]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:05:59.015 --> 02:06:03.156]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.256 --> 02:06:14.138]  The New World Order Control Freak crowd are extremely arrogant.
[02:06:16.758 --> 02:06:28.683]  And so when you've got scientific polls with 84% telling Angus and Reed for the Wall Street Journal and ABC News that they believe the government's lying about what really happened on 9-11.
[02:06:30.364 --> 02:06:41.288]  And in scores of other Mason Dictions, there's been like 7 or 8, I quit counting, Zogby, all these other countless scientific, non-scientific,
[02:06:41.923 --> 02:06:50.430]  They all are above 65% believing inside job or cover-up, or 80 plus percent saying they're being lied to.
[02:06:50.450 --> 02:06:57.016]  Then they have unscientific polls on CNN, 83%.
[02:06:57.576 --> 02:06:59.378]  MSNBC, 87% unscientific.
[02:06:59.598 --> 02:07:02.621]  So the unscientific are showing the same numbers as the scientific.
[02:07:03.541 --> 02:07:07.485]  I mean, it just polls every month for the last three or four years, and they grow.
[02:07:10.203 --> 02:07:26.534]  And so the establishment just comes out and says, Gary Hart comes out and says, we have staged terror attacks before, you better look into that, and don't think that the American people are against this war right now, that if there is a big catalyzing event, they won't be for it.
[02:07:26.994 --> 02:07:29.636]  So you better ask yourself, does our government stage attacks?
[02:07:31.277 --> 02:07:32.738]  I mean, it's not even veiled.
[02:07:34.582 --> 02:07:43.048]  And Zbigniew Brzezinski goes in front of the Senate in February of this year and says, well, we can stage provocations, like the Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:07:46.230 --> 02:07:50.032]  And they're just throwing the gauntlet down.
[02:07:50.052 --> 02:07:55.616]  When Santorum comes out and says, former Senator Bigniocom, we're going to have terror attacks and you're all going to shut up.
[02:07:55.636 --> 02:07:57.317]  You're going to know the war on terror was right.
[02:07:57.357 --> 02:08:00.439]  And Republican memos say we've got to have another terror attack.
[02:08:02.106 --> 02:08:08.388]  Their editorial writers come out and say, 9-11 was good, we need another 9-11, because it's going to unify us.
[02:08:11.209 --> 02:08:17.771]  They're saying, okay, alright, you know we did it, we'll do it again, and the dumb people will follow us.
[02:08:18.491 --> 02:08:20.972]  Mike, do you agree that that's basically what they're saying?
[02:08:20.992 --> 02:08:22.813]  Uh, yes, I do.
[02:08:24.493 --> 02:08:25.954]  Man, that is arrogant, is it not?
[02:08:26.014 --> 02:08:27.354]  I mean, they're just out in the open now!
[02:08:28.727 --> 02:08:29.548]  Uh, yeah.
[02:08:30.088 --> 02:08:46.078]  You know, when the drop lines on the TV start saying, uh, this guy's from CFR, uh, whereas, you know, not too many years ago, you know, they denied the existence of the organization, uh, this is what I think Alice Bailey called the externalization of the hierarchy.
[02:08:46.198 --> 02:08:52.462]  These people are coming out, uh, coming out of their closets, uh, and they're, uh, unembarrassed.
[02:08:54.179 --> 02:09:00.485]  Now the question is, are they doing that because we were exposing them and by them stonewalling it made it look even worse?
[02:09:01.085 --> 02:09:03.047]  Or are they doing that just to throw down the gauntlet?
[02:09:04.428 --> 02:09:05.309]  It's probably a little of both.
[02:09:07.531 --> 02:09:17.319]  Yeah, I think they're just very arrogant and they think that their plan is so neatly tied up that there's nothing we can do about it now.
[02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:21.703]  Or at least they want us to see that facade.
[02:09:26.206 --> 02:09:38.455]  I'm actually more and more on this show speechless, Mike, because to have a criminal elite, mad dog running around, I know I keep saying it because I can't get over it, writing memos saying they can sexually torture toddlers.
[02:09:39.195 --> 02:09:42.337]  I mean, that isn't real to me, and I know how evil they are.
[02:09:42.938 --> 02:09:47.661]  I mean, you've been around, you've seen some things, you're a medical doctor, you've been fighting the old order for decades.
[02:09:48.323 --> 02:09:52.144]  I mean, why do you think they would write memos like that and then release them?
[02:09:52.164 --> 02:09:58.986]  Is that all part of the externalization of the method, the psychological inoculation for even greater horrors to come?
[02:10:00.567 --> 02:10:01.227]  I think so.
[02:10:02.627 --> 02:10:15.511]  You know, it's really hard to get into the minds of these preachers, but yeah, I think they get some kind of additional power from telegraphing their punches.
[02:10:16.618 --> 02:10:18.799]  Being very open about what they're doing.
[02:10:22.822 --> 02:10:26.744]  My wife and I moved up here to a pretty small town.
[02:10:27.464 --> 02:10:31.586]  I didn't want to be in the big city when the crackdown occurred.
[02:10:33.247 --> 02:10:35.929]  It's had some benefits that I didn't even anticipate.
[02:10:35.969 --> 02:10:43.333]  The newspapers around here have literally printed everything unedited that I've written.
[02:10:46.010 --> 02:11:02.481]  Not one of the papers, I think they got some heat from someone, probably the Sheriff's Department, and they changed their policy to, you know, you can't submit an opinion piece more often than once every six weeks, which definitely slowed me down because I was printing at the rate of about one a week.
[02:11:03.141 --> 02:11:14.749]  But consider, for you folks that can't move, or at least not that quickly, if you have friends in small towns, if you can talk them into submitting pieces on your behalf,
[02:11:15.428 --> 02:11:25.400]  Just mail them something and have them send it in to the local paper, even if it's only to say the media is tightly controlled and check out this website.
[02:11:26.185 --> 02:11:31.928]  Oh yeah, they are desperate for content, the small family or small corporation on papers.
[02:11:32.348 --> 02:11:38.832]  Hey, Mike, you want to write articles for PrisonPlanet.com or Infowars.com, and you can do it under a pseudonym if you like.
[02:11:39.232 --> 02:11:40.372]  We need that content.
[02:11:40.413 --> 02:11:46.996]  It won't be a thousand people that read it, it'll be ten thousand, a hundred thousand, sometimes a million people read our articles, it depends which one's hit.
[02:11:47.586 --> 02:11:48.706]  That's what we're trying to do.
[02:11:48.726 --> 02:11:54.108]  Mike, where do you see all this fleshing out in the next year, two years, three years, five years, ten years?
[02:12:13.903 --> 02:12:14.504]  I don't know.
[02:12:15.044 --> 02:12:17.226]  These people have so many different ways that they could go.
[02:12:17.286 --> 02:12:22.270]  They could have a phony terrorist incident.
[02:12:22.730 --> 02:12:27.534]  They've already set that up with the Iranian money being left along the border.
[02:12:28.855 --> 02:12:31.618]  So they could use that as a pretext to go into Iran.
[02:12:32.959 --> 02:12:37.262]  Or they could turn it around and just go ahead and attack Iran.
[02:12:38.655 --> 02:12:52.328]  And then down the road, we'll have the phony terrorist attack, and they'll say, oh, this was an obvious retaliation for... Or Iran might actually blow up three aircraft carriers with cruise missiles, and then we really are in World War III.
[02:12:52.388 --> 02:12:53.990]  I mean, they might actually fight back.
[02:12:56.071 --> 02:12:57.193]  I doubt it.
[02:12:57.693 --> 02:13:00.996]  I don't think they want to go one-on-one with... and it won't be one-on-one.
[02:13:01.056 --> 02:13:02.778]  I mean, Israel will pile on, I'm sure.
[02:13:04.063 --> 02:13:04.763]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:13:04.803 --> 02:13:08.525]  I mean, Iran has been told that thousands of targets are going to be hit.
[02:13:08.685 --> 02:13:12.007]  Power plants, water plants, entire infrastructure destruction.
[02:13:12.287 --> 02:13:21.932]  This is an unbelievable crime, and the average pot-bellied American doesn't know our government overthrew their government, set up torture police for 20-plus years.
[02:13:21.992 --> 02:13:23.112]  What, from 53 to 79?
[02:13:23.172 --> 02:13:24.973]  That's 30-plus years.
[02:13:25.533 --> 02:13:33.057]  You know, all of this stuff going on, and it's just an absolute... We are so evil.
[02:13:33.869 --> 02:13:36.492]  And then the Iranians just sit there and take it?
[02:13:36.813 --> 02:13:41.298]  And then our government funded Saddam to attack them and killed over a million three?
[02:13:42.606 --> 02:13:43.666]  And they still take it?
[02:13:43.727 --> 02:13:46.628]  And then we've blown up two of their airliners trying to get them to fight?
[02:13:46.928 --> 02:13:52.530]  It's like the old westerns where the bad guy has already shot the daddy who was coming into the shop to sell his gold.
[02:13:52.930 --> 02:13:54.191]  These are based on true stories.
[02:13:54.491 --> 02:13:57.532]  And then he throws the gun down in front of the 12-year-old and says, pick it up, son.
[02:13:57.872 --> 02:13:58.212]  Pick it up.
[02:13:58.232 --> 02:14:03.495]  And then he makes fun of the kid's dad and the kid goes to pick it up and he shoots him and he says, you saw it, he had a gun.
[02:14:03.875 --> 02:14:06.176]  I mean, I'm embarrassed of what we've done to Iran.
[02:14:06.796 --> 02:14:07.296]  In our name.
[02:14:07.836 --> 02:14:11.458]  Yeah, and Iraq and Lebanon and, you know, the list is
[02:14:11.977 --> 02:14:19.161]  Well, what do you think about how they have convinced the public that Shiites are Al-Qaeda?
[02:14:20.802 --> 02:14:23.644]  Well, you know, that's a sad statement.
[02:14:23.684 --> 02:14:35.832]  I mean, when you go out on the street and interview people and they can't find Africa on a map, obviously their education program set up by the Rockefellers has been a tremendous success.
[02:14:37.352 --> 02:14:38.693]  You were going to say something, go ahead.
[02:14:38.933 --> 02:14:49.598]  Yeah, I just want to point out, I know you've got to get on to other callers, Bernadine Smith runs an organization called the Second Amendment Committee, I think it is.
[02:14:49.718 --> 02:14:51.158]  Yeah, she's in California, great lady.
[02:14:51.499 --> 02:15:02.804]  Right, your website covers the events of the last few years and you get a lot of documents on various topics, but she's got a lot of the old
[02:15:03.904 --> 02:15:04.985]  historical documents.
[02:15:05.485 --> 02:15:13.908]  Oh, she's got New York Times articles from 1937 where they said they were going to have ten regions in the world government and ten regions in the U.S.
[02:15:13.968 --> 02:15:17.390]  and how they were going to incrementally hire foreigners for the police and military.
[02:15:18.010 --> 02:15:19.371]  I mean, she sent me a binder.
[02:15:19.391 --> 02:15:24.433]  It's somewhere in my office that's like six inches thick of just news articles.
[02:15:24.573 --> 02:15:28.935]  Oh yeah, I've got boxes of stuff from her, but she's got a great website.
[02:15:28.975 --> 02:15:31.256]  I guess she revamped it.
[02:15:31.897 --> 02:15:33.719]  It's libertygunrights.com.
[02:15:34.019 --> 02:15:34.980]  I'm going to get her on that set.
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:35.561]  I keep forgetting.
[02:15:35.581 --> 02:15:36.221]  Yeah, you should.
[02:15:36.501 --> 02:15:56.020]  She's championing the cause of this Tennessee police chief who lost his peace officer certification because he was fighting the, you know, he was exposing the anti-gun agenda of the New World Order and they just, they trumped up phony charges against him.
[02:15:56.969 --> 02:16:01.832]  And eventually they got something to stick, I guess, or they just decertified him just out of the blue.
[02:16:02.373 --> 02:16:05.175]  Well, that's the sad part is they go after the good cops.
[02:16:05.495 --> 02:16:07.216]  LibertyGunRights.com.
[02:16:07.256 --> 02:16:08.237]  I'm going to get Bernadine on.
[02:16:08.637 --> 02:16:08.817]  Yeah.
[02:16:09.758 --> 02:16:10.058]  Thanks.
[02:16:10.478 --> 02:16:11.519]  Good talking to you, Alex.
[02:16:11.739 --> 02:16:12.140]  Yeah, Mike.
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:13.461]  Submit some of those articles to us.
[02:16:13.921 --> 02:16:14.341]  Okay.
[02:16:14.361 --> 02:16:14.761]  God bless.
[02:16:14.902 --> 02:16:15.282]  You bet.
[02:16:15.442 --> 02:16:15.782]  Okay.
[02:16:16.042 --> 02:16:18.944]  I had Mike on for 20 minutes, but he's a really good guy.
[02:16:18.964 --> 02:16:19.625]  I wanted to hear from him.
[02:16:20.065 --> 02:16:21.146]  Let's jam him in right now.
[02:16:21.186 --> 02:16:22.127]  Hold him over if need be.
[02:16:22.207 --> 02:16:23.167]  Joe in California.
[02:16:23.207 --> 02:16:23.568]  Go ahead.
[02:16:23.588 --> 02:16:24.768]  Hello.
[02:16:26.542 --> 02:16:27.683]  Yes, Jim in Northern California.
[02:16:28.263 --> 02:16:32.684]  Anyway, thanks a lot for what you and your guys do for this Republic.
[02:16:33.445 --> 02:16:36.226]  There's something I want to run past, it's just your opinion.
[02:16:36.886 --> 02:16:51.671]  A lot of people say there's no sleeper cells in the United States, but I think they're letting them in through the southern borders and all we have to do is attack Iran and they can rise up and raise you know what.
[02:16:52.611 --> 02:16:54.692]  And as soon as that happens,
[02:16:55.692 --> 02:16:57.333]  Everything's going to come unglued here.
[02:16:58.754 --> 02:17:13.525]  Well, it is true that there's no doubt that there are Iranians who won't need orders from headquarters, who will probably shoot some people, burn some things, do some things, if war with Iran gets kicked off.
[02:17:13.565 --> 02:17:14.745]  Stay there, let's talk about it when we get back.
[02:17:15.486 --> 02:17:24.172]  But the real sleeper cells are 5,000 Iraqis, Pentagon CIA trained, in every city in the United States.
[02:17:25.103 --> 02:17:26.145]  Waiting with weapons.
[02:17:26.185 --> 02:17:27.527]  And they don't work for Saddam.
[02:17:28.028 --> 02:17:29.550]  They don't work for Ahmadinejad.
[02:17:29.590 --> 02:17:33.696]  They work for the New World Order.
[02:17:34.057 --> 02:17:38.704]  And 5,000 Special Forces troops can bring this country to a standstill within 24 hours.
[02:17:44.250 --> 02:17:55.522]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[02:17:55.742 --> 02:18:03.370]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable
[02:18:03.370 --> 02:18:04.010]  I think so.
[02:18:25.447 --> 02:18:27.529]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[02:18:27.609 --> 02:18:29.590]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[02:18:29.650 --> 02:18:30.191]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.
[02:18:30.211 --> 02:18:30.531]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:30.651 --> 02:18:32.252]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:18:32.292 --> 02:18:33.233]  Now yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:42.262 --> 02:18:42.722]  Gold.
[02:18:43.042 --> 02:18:44.323]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:18:44.563 --> 02:18:50.667]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:18:50.867 --> 02:18:54.669]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:18:55.029 --> 02:18:56.930]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:18:56.970 --> 02:18:59.271]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:18:59.411 --> 02:19:06.715]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every
[02:19:06.815 --> 02:19:07.757]  We're good to go.
[02:19:22.279 --> 02:19:27.902]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[02:19:28.222 --> 02:19:30.763]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.783 --> 02:19:37.146]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[02:19:37.166 --> 02:19:38.327]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:19:41.648 --> 02:19:46.209]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:49.570]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:19:49.870 --> 02:19:52.431]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:19:52.811 --> 02:19:57.612]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:19:58.013 --> 02:20:03.374]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:20:03.674 --> 02:20:06.635]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[02:20:06.835 --> 02:20:07.395]  We're good to go.
[02:20:30.246 --> 02:20:30.467]  We're good.
[02:20:42.055 --> 02:20:43.896]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:20:44.036 --> 02:20:49.219]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:20:49.379 --> 02:20:50.740]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:59.184]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:20:59.384 --> 02:21:05.127]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:21:05.427 --> 02:21:05.727]  I think so.
[02:21:25.247 --> 02:21:25.787]  I think so.
[02:21:54.588 --> 02:21:56.149]  Don't want no shackles.
[02:21:58.111 --> 02:22:03.656]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[02:22:03.897 --> 02:22:06.519]  Don't want no shackles.
[02:22:06.719 --> 02:22:12.865]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[02:22:13.225 --> 02:22:16.088]  I sit down with Big Brother.
[02:22:16.468 --> 02:22:17.429]  Don't like those RFIs.
[02:22:22.402 --> 02:22:30.367]  Ah, Jimmy Vaughn, blues legend.
[02:22:30.407 --> 02:22:32.308]  Good friend of mine right here in Austin, Texas.
[02:22:32.508 --> 02:22:38.232]  Say hi to Jimmy and Robin and his fine family.
[02:22:53.626 --> 02:23:02.211]  That's a good point that Jim in California, Northern California, brings up.
[02:23:03.532 --> 02:23:10.015]  That what's going to happen economically if Iran gets attacked, it's going to cause oil to at least triple in prices for a while.
[02:23:11.436 --> 02:23:16.899]  It's going to cause even more countries to dump the dollar, they've all said they will, which is exactly what the globalists want.
[02:23:17.552 --> 02:23:20.673]  Got the head of the Federal Reserve and the former head running around bad-mouthing the dollar.
[02:23:21.354 --> 02:23:25.375]  It'll further destroy our name, but then we hear that there's all these Iranian sleeper cells.
[02:23:26.376 --> 02:23:32.979]  But what about the 3,500 Iraqi Republican Guard brought here and trained by the U.S.
[02:23:33.379 --> 02:23:36.860]  before the war in 1991 and after?
[02:23:37.260 --> 02:23:39.281]  And then brought here after, and then Bill Clinton brought in another 2,000.
[02:23:39.641 --> 02:23:40.782]  So it's more than 5,000.
[02:23:41.282 --> 02:23:43.103]  And just guess what?
[02:23:43.483 --> 02:23:45.844]  Those are the guys involved in Oklahoma City, documented.
[02:23:47.620 --> 02:23:49.081]  And they're protected by the U.S.
[02:23:49.121 --> 02:23:53.382]  government, just like the supposed hijackers out of Saudi Arabia were trained at all these U.S.
[02:23:53.402 --> 02:23:55.183]  military bases.
[02:23:55.203 --> 02:23:56.824]  They're the perfect double agents.
[02:23:56.844 --> 02:23:59.305]  They're the perfect people to go out and carry out the terror.
[02:24:01.586 --> 02:24:05.547]  But you say you're worried, Jim, specifically about Iranians, huh?
[02:24:06.168 --> 02:24:08.349]  Well, not necessarily just about Iranians.
[02:24:08.369 --> 02:24:10.129]  They're just here.
[02:24:12.128 --> 02:24:12.628]  I don't think.
[02:24:12.928 --> 02:24:28.972]  If America is ready to go, if our government is ready to put us under martial law, they don't need a pretext because if they attack Iran and all these people rise up, there's going to be just chaos everywhere and it would be a perfect opportunity for them to bring in martial law.
[02:24:28.992 --> 02:24:32.613]  Well, most Iranians are going to run around and wave flags.
[02:24:33.133 --> 02:24:37.034]  I'm not saying that it's just Iranians.
[02:24:37.354 --> 02:24:41.515]  It's people that our government is letting come in here.
[02:24:42.222 --> 02:24:42.802]  To do this.
[02:24:43.463 --> 02:24:58.835]  I think they're getting ready to declare martial law, and what they'll do is when we attack Iran, they'll get things going in all the cities, and then they'll be able to declare martial law and do whatever they want at that point.
[02:24:59.595 --> 02:25:02.497]  And if they're ready to take America down, they could sure do it that way.
[02:25:02.537 --> 02:25:04.119]  Well, that's why they want to have the war.
[02:25:04.159 --> 02:25:06.360]  It will bring us into deeper tyranny, and I appreciate your call.
[02:25:06.380 --> 02:25:07.241]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:25:08.338 --> 02:25:11.240]  Yeah, we're in a war on terror, but the border stays wide open.
[02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:12.560]  It's just such a sick joke.
[02:25:13.220 --> 02:25:16.202]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bill in Iowa.
[02:25:16.242 --> 02:25:16.802]  Bill, go ahead.
[02:25:16.822 --> 02:25:21.224]  Yes, Alex, you're talking about sleeper cells.
[02:25:21.965 --> 02:25:23.565]  Yeah, try talking right into your telephone.
[02:25:24.826 --> 02:25:26.447]  Okay, can you hear me now?
[02:25:26.727 --> 02:25:26.967]  Yes.
[02:25:27.887 --> 02:25:35.191]  Okay, I think we've got more sleeper cells here than they've got fire ants in South Texas.
[02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:45.383]  Talking about, that's not the reason I called, but anyway, I have two other things, but sleeper cells.
[02:25:46.543 --> 02:25:53.106]  Okay, on September the 11th, 2001, we had Flight 11, Flight 77, Flight 175, and Flight 93.
[02:25:53.226 --> 02:25:54.587]  Were there sleeper cells here then?
[02:25:54.707 --> 02:25:55.987]  Oh, there definitely were.
[02:25:56.007 --> 02:25:56.367]  Well, okay.
[02:26:06.676 --> 02:26:09.217]  What, how do you define sleeper cells?
[02:26:09.897 --> 02:26:12.017]  Well, they're guys publicly trained at U.S.
[02:26:12.057 --> 02:26:13.577]  military bases and given U.S.
[02:26:13.617 --> 02:26:17.298]  government high anti-terror clearances to go and come from the country.
[02:26:17.658 --> 02:26:18.659]  All mainstream news.
[02:26:20.059 --> 02:26:31.561]  Yeah, well, uh, who, uh, are they in cahoots with our, you know, the, the, the... Listen, you're not talking into your telephone.
[02:26:31.581 --> 02:26:32.821]  You're covering your phone up in there.
[02:26:32.841 --> 02:26:35.122]  Are they in the sleeper cells?
[02:26:35.683 --> 02:26:38.025]  Are they in with our establishment?
[02:26:39.026 --> 02:26:39.927]  Absolutely, yes.
[02:26:40.208 --> 02:26:41.168]  Okay, thank you.
[02:26:43.371 --> 02:26:43.911]  Are you still there?
[02:26:46.954 --> 02:26:51.078]  Are they editing your website?
[02:26:53.340 --> 02:26:54.161]  What does that mean?
[02:26:57.504 --> 02:27:00.087]  Is somebody editing your website?
[02:27:01.273 --> 02:27:03.854]  Yeah, my employees are, yeah.
[02:27:04.135 --> 02:27:21.723]  Okay, well the reason I ask, you had a story on a couple of days ago about we were going to attack Iran on October the 10th and it was first going to be Israel and then the U.S.
[02:27:21.763 --> 02:27:23.404]  was going to do the second wave.
[02:27:24.304 --> 02:27:25.625]  Oh, you're saying we took it down?
[02:27:27.285 --> 02:27:28.646]  I can't find it anywhere.
[02:27:28.666 --> 02:27:28.746]  Yeah.
[02:27:30.006 --> 02:27:31.227]  Must be a conspiracy.
[02:27:32.488 --> 02:27:33.448]  We're on the march.
[02:27:33.888 --> 02:27:35.529]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:28:43.428 --> 02:28:44.589]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD.
[02:28:44.609 --> 02:28:46.991]  I'm the Nuclear Medical Report here on Genesis.
[02:28:47.131 --> 02:28:50.114]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nucleosidicals U.S.
[02:28:50.174 --> 02:28:50.854]  is a real thing.
[02:28:50.934 --> 02:28:57.760]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial, antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[02:28:58.601 --> 02:28:59.082]  We're good to go.

[02:29:34.213 --> 02:29:36.775]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[02:29:42.794 --> 02:29:48.798]  How would you like to have a tool to use at home that you can use anytime that helps reduce back pain, sciatica, hip pain, and more?
[02:29:49.018 --> 02:29:51.780]  A tool that helps relieve the pain and doesn't just treat the symptoms.
[02:29:52.020 --> 02:29:54.302]  You need the SacroEggie Sacral Stabilizer.
[02:29:54.582 --> 02:29:58.184]  One satisfied user states, I don't believe in gadgets, but this is a miracle.
[02:29:58.325 --> 02:29:59.125]  Yes, that's right.
[02:29:59.185 --> 02:30:04.188]  Just relax 20 minutes daily or when needed to help correct the muscle imbalance that creates many of these symptoms.
[02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:08.051]  Gravity does the work with the SacroEggie under the sacrum and support under your neck.
[02:30:08.251 --> 02:30:10.313]  Help correct posture to help relieve the pain.
[02:30:10.913 --> 02:30:11.133]  I think so.
[02:30:39.487 --> 02:30:53.175]  Sean in Brooklyn.
[02:30:53.716 --> 02:30:54.516]  Joe in England.
[02:30:55.817 --> 02:30:57.398]  Derek and Dave.
[02:30:57.478 --> 02:30:59.299]  That'll be the last four calls we take.
[02:30:59.579 --> 02:31:03.361]  I'm gonna play some clips from the film Shooter as well.
[02:31:03.762 --> 02:31:06.363]  But right now, let's hear a little bit of Hank Williams Jr.
[02:31:06.843 --> 02:31:07.704]  You want a solution?
[02:31:08.664 --> 02:31:09.985]  Get back to the land!
[02:31:10.005 --> 02:31:12.225]  Don't be dependent on government!
[02:31:33.477 --> 02:31:36.219]  I can plow a field all day long.
[02:31:36.319 --> 02:31:40.741]  I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn.
[02:31:42.322 --> 02:31:47.505]  We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too.
[02:31:47.585 --> 02:31:52.368]  Ain't too many things these old boys can't do.
[02:31:54.889 --> 02:32:01.053]  We grow good old tomatoes and homemade wine and country boy can survive.
[02:32:08.499 --> 02:32:10.520]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:14.441]  Thank you again for tuning in today.
[02:32:38.471 --> 02:32:43.975]  And we can skin a bus, we can run a trot line, and a country boy can survive.
[02:32:45.156 --> 02:32:52.421]  Country folks can survive!
[02:32:53.061 --> 02:32:55.963]  I had a good friend in New York City.
[02:32:56.183 --> 02:32:59.125]  He never called me by my name, just Hillbilly.
[02:33:04.145 --> 02:33:10.671]  My grandpa taught me how to live off the land, and he taught him to be a businessman.
[02:33:11.131 --> 02:33:21.680]  He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights, and I'd send him some homemade wine.
[02:33:26.082 --> 02:33:29.445]  But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife.
[02:33:29.865 --> 02:33:36.270]  For $43 my friend lost his life.
[02:33:37.631 --> 02:33:40.853]  I'd love to spit some beech nut in that dude's eyes.
[02:33:40.973 --> 02:33:43.155]  And shoot him with my old .45.
[02:33:43.255 --> 02:33:46.197]  Cause a country boy can survive.
[02:33:46.277 --> 02:33:48.078]  Country folks can survive.
[02:34:07.371 --> 02:34:10.692]  Alright, let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[02:34:11.892 --> 02:34:13.573]  Well, first off, I promised to do this.
[02:34:13.613 --> 02:34:18.775]  I played it once yesterday, once earlier, and I'm going to play it one more time, and then right before it comes out in a few weeks, I'm going to play it again.
[02:34:19.155 --> 02:34:22.976]  These go on sale tomorrow, and we'll package your order up.
[02:34:23.016 --> 02:34:26.697]  We've got them, and we'll ship them out to you coming up at the end of this month.
[02:34:28.386 --> 02:34:30.987]  And it is the Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:34:31.007 --> 02:34:34.509]  You've got to go to InfoWars.com, right up at the top of the page.
[02:34:36.290 --> 02:34:39.192]  One of the four top stories is a link to the new trailer.
[02:34:39.232 --> 02:34:40.452]  This is the official trailer.
[02:34:40.932 --> 02:34:47.156]  Aaron did a great job on the other three trailers, and Rob has now done the fourth and final official trailer.
[02:34:47.576 --> 02:34:53.679]  You can watch all four of the trailers at WhatIsTheEndgame.com or at EndgameTheMovie.com.
[02:34:54.463 --> 02:34:59.045]  But if you go up to Infowars.com right now, you can watch the official trailer.
[02:34:59.285 --> 02:35:00.606]  Here's the audio from it.
[02:35:02.246 --> 02:35:03.707]  It is a big idea.
[02:35:04.788 --> 02:35:05.828]  A new world order.
[02:35:10.170 --> 02:35:16.333]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:35:16.413 --> 02:35:18.173]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:35:19.274 --> 02:35:21.455]  Both their objective being world domination,
[02:35:23.672 --> 02:35:26.155]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:35:27.036 --> 02:35:34.505]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:35:41.204 --> 02:35:46.266]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:35:47.306 --> 02:35:52.508]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:35:52.788 --> 02:35:59.490]  Dillberg is making great progress toward a world government, and only an educated form of it can stop them in their tracks.
[02:35:59.810 --> 02:36:00.010]  Alex!
[02:36:02.470 --> 02:36:06.171]  For the first time, all the pieces have been put together.
[02:36:06.211 --> 02:36:09.532]  The dots have been connected, and the picture is crystal clear.
[02:36:10.112 --> 02:36:14.252]  Earth's ruling elite believe they have discovered the fountain.
[02:36:15.033 --> 02:36:19.273]  But before they can attain it, 80% of us must die.
[02:36:19.293 --> 02:36:26.755]  A psychopathic technocracy is establishing world government so there can be no escape from their plan.
[02:36:32.216 --> 02:36:34.457]  The new world order is the old world order.
[02:36:34.497 --> 02:36:37.219]  I mean, it's just the names have changed, the appearances have changed.
[02:36:37.479 --> 02:36:38.620]  Most people have no idea.
[02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:39.420]  They're not after money.
[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:40.521]  They have all the money they need.
[02:36:40.761 --> 02:36:41.502]  They're after power.
[02:36:42.482 --> 02:36:43.383]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[02:36:44.984 --> 02:36:48.826]  I would pull up a plane and you and I could be interrogated for four hours.
[02:36:48.846 --> 02:36:49.786]  Some shots were fired.
[02:36:49.806 --> 02:36:52.148]  We need you to move off the province.
[02:36:52.188 --> 02:36:55.770]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:37:00.655 --> 02:37:01.115]  Endgame.
[02:37:01.396 --> 02:37:03.217]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:37:03.477 --> 02:37:05.078]  You have been warned.
[02:37:09.241 --> 02:37:13.744]  Coming to the Info War October 26 at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:37:13.764 --> 02:37:17.267]  You'll also be able to see it at WhatIsTheEndgame.com.
[02:37:18.528 --> 02:37:21.290]  And then it'll ship out to you November 1st on DVD.
[02:37:25.140 --> 02:37:28.002]  Let's go ahead and go to Sean in Brooklyn and Joe in England.
[02:37:28.022 --> 02:37:29.003]  He's been holding patiently.
[02:37:29.163 --> 02:37:30.084]  Joe, I know you're on your own.
[02:37:30.104 --> 02:37:30.964]  Don, we'll get to you soon.
[02:37:30.984 --> 02:37:31.565]  Go ahead, John.
[02:37:32.345 --> 02:37:32.745]  Hey, Alex.
[02:37:32.785 --> 02:37:33.266]  How's it going?
[02:37:33.446 --> 02:37:33.826]  Good, sir.
[02:37:34.967 --> 02:37:38.209]  Yeah, I had a chance to see Endgame when you were here in New York.
[02:37:38.970 --> 02:37:39.810]  It was very good.
[02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:42.852]  It was very professional, very cinematic.
[02:37:44.173 --> 02:37:46.035]  It's definitely the best thing you've done.
[02:37:47.516 --> 02:37:49.177]  I've heard you say that it's long.
[02:37:49.756 --> 02:37:52.157]  I actually wanted more, to be honest with you.
[02:37:52.277 --> 02:37:57.780]  Well, New York was great, but that was a little bitty screen with like 800 people or whatever watching it.
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:00.041]  You ought to see it on a really big screen or on the television.
[02:38:01.522 --> 02:38:12.167]  Yeah, I had a question about the movie and I also wanted to speak to you about the police officers.
[02:38:12.227 --> 02:38:18.210]  In the movie, when you're talking about the meetings that they're having,
[02:38:19.964 --> 02:38:25.609]  I seem to remember you showed a picture of Hillary, but was she actually on the list for that meeting?
[02:38:26.850 --> 02:38:27.370]  Uh, no.
[02:38:27.670 --> 02:38:31.693]  I mean, are you saying... What's your exact question?
[02:38:31.713 --> 02:38:33.375]  I'm trying to decipher what you're getting at.
[02:38:34.676 --> 02:38:39.139]  Um, when you were talking about the meeting in the movie, the Bilderberg meeting?
[02:38:39.619 --> 02:38:39.880]  Yes.
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:48.026]  Yeah, um... A picture of Hillary flashed on the screen, something to the effect of anybody could be there.
[02:38:48.980 --> 02:38:57.382]  Oh no, uh, we, we... I was just wondering if she was on the list for that meeting because I don't remember that being... Yeah, let me, let me, let me answer your question.
[02:38:57.622 --> 02:38:58.603]  And I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:38:59.383 --> 02:39:13.726]  Um, we say that we were told by people that worked at the hotel, and we also made calls to her office and they got very upset about it, uh, and that it looks like she was in Canada at the time, and then we showed the big vehicles unloading.
[02:39:13.786 --> 02:39:15.727]  You must have been in the bathroom at that part in the film.
[02:39:16.603 --> 02:39:19.744]  Uh, that we were told Hillary was there, but was not on the list.
[02:39:20.464 --> 02:39:24.285]  And then we gave examples of people that attend, but are not on the list.
[02:39:25.066 --> 02:39:28.627]  Okay, so Bill Clinton's been to Bilderberg, Hillary's been before.
[02:39:29.607 --> 02:39:36.229]  But they're not supposed to go because of a violation of the Logan Act, uh, but they still went in the past.
[02:39:36.469 --> 02:39:39.290]  So we cannot confirm she was there, but we know she was there.
[02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:43.811]  Uh, Rick Perrin, on the other hand, has decided to publicly announce he was going and went.
[02:39:44.540 --> 02:39:46.441]  So, I hope that answers your question.
[02:39:46.461 --> 02:39:47.801]  I've got to move quick here, folks.
[02:39:47.821 --> 02:39:48.701]  I've got a clip I want to play.
[02:39:49.081 --> 02:39:50.342]  Joe in England, you're on the air.
[02:39:51.962 --> 02:39:52.563]  Hi, Alex.
[02:39:52.703 --> 02:39:54.283]  Yeah, just something I wanted to mention.
[02:39:54.343 --> 02:39:55.483]  I thought it might cheer you up.
[02:39:55.644 --> 02:40:02.766]  We're having a demo in London for the anniversary of 9-11 last month, and we're getting a lot of support from the public.
[02:40:03.466 --> 02:40:06.527]  And a bus driver actually drove past and he shouted out,
[02:40:07.051 --> 02:40:08.331]  Go Alex Jones!
[02:40:08.351 --> 02:40:10.212]  That was brilliant.
[02:40:10.232 --> 02:40:15.053]  So, that kind of proves that your work is, you know, pretty much recognised internationally, you know.
[02:40:15.693 --> 02:40:18.033]  But, yeah, just one quick thing I wanted to mention.
[02:40:18.053 --> 02:40:22.154]  There's been a lot of spin in the mainstream media lately about the Princess Diana thing.
[02:40:22.594 --> 02:40:30.976]  And one of the points that I'd just like to bring across is, they're basically saying that because, if they can prove she wasn't pregnant, that proves she wasn't murdered, basically.
[02:40:31.276 --> 02:40:31.896]  The point is,
[02:40:32.665 --> 02:40:34.286]  He's believed that she was pregnant.
[02:40:34.326 --> 02:40:34.986]  That we can prove.
[02:40:35.006 --> 02:40:45.712]  I mean, we've got people out there... Well, the point is, too, she told all these people and wrote a letter and made a video saying Prince Charles told me he's going to kill me and make it look like a staged auto accident.
[02:40:46.553 --> 02:40:49.094]  And then the cameras all turned off right before she wrecked.
[02:40:49.134 --> 02:40:50.875]  They kept her in the car for 30, 40 minutes.
[02:40:51.175 --> 02:40:52.116]  Then drove her slow.
[02:40:52.176 --> 02:40:53.757]  I mean, it's just, it's very, it's incredible.
[02:40:54.097 --> 02:40:54.617]  Well, what?
[02:40:54.938 --> 02:40:57.419]  Almost 90% of Brits believe the government killed her, so...
[02:40:58.208 --> 02:41:02.450]  Well, I do the Cremation of Care website, and there's a lot of stuff on there, Diana, on there.
[02:41:02.690 --> 02:41:06.471]  And I actually printed some of it out and took it into work, and some of the people were just amazed.
[02:41:06.491 --> 02:41:14.614]  I actually took a copy of the letter in, where she basically says, you know, my husband is going to, um, is planning on killing me in a car accident, in inverted commas.
[02:41:15.074 --> 02:41:21.236]  So I guess if it's disrespectful to make conspiracy theories about her death, then I guess she was being disrespectful as well.
[02:41:21.716 --> 02:41:22.397]  Absolutely.
[02:41:22.597 --> 02:41:23.477]  Plug your website.
[02:41:24.217 --> 02:41:25.778]  Cremationofcare.com
[02:41:26.611 --> 02:41:28.072]  It's been going for a couple of years now.
[02:41:28.352 --> 02:41:29.273]  Yeah, you do a great job.
[02:41:29.293 --> 02:41:30.133]  Good to hear from you, man.
[02:41:30.513 --> 02:41:31.034]  No problem.
[02:41:31.614 --> 02:41:32.214]  God bless you.
[02:41:32.595 --> 02:41:35.857]  Okay, I wanted to hurry up so I could get to this six-minute clip from the shooter.
[02:41:36.557 --> 02:41:48.144]  The Gatekeeper Invasion, the fella who puts together a lot of great stuff with our work up on YouTube, introed one of my radio shows with these clips from the shooter where they hire him
[02:41:49.998 --> 02:41:59.124]  As a former special forces sniper who they'd already set up once to go back in and simulate trying to figure out where a sniper might take a shot at the president.
[02:41:59.464 --> 02:42:01.265]  Turns out that the whole thing's a black op.
[02:42:01.325 --> 02:42:01.966]  It's staged.
[02:42:02.286 --> 02:42:03.567]  They plan to frame him.
[02:42:04.708 --> 02:42:06.229]  And then he finds out it's all a big scam.
[02:42:06.249 --> 02:42:06.569]  Here it is.
[02:42:06.589 --> 02:42:10.531]  I don't see what lies to try to sell us today.
[02:42:14.254 --> 02:42:17.376]  This is a man with a history of duty and patriotism.
[02:42:18.542 --> 02:42:20.923]  Not as punchlines, but as core beliefs.
[02:42:22.304 --> 02:42:25.105]  Some people don't know what to do when their belief system collapses.
[02:42:26.386 --> 02:42:27.546]  Bob Lee is one of those.
[02:42:27.606 --> 02:42:28.807]  We need you to do this.
[02:42:29.327 --> 02:42:30.728]  Don't really like the President much.
[02:42:30.748 --> 02:42:33.129]  Didn't like the one before that much either.
[02:42:33.409 --> 02:42:34.749]  You like the idea of the President?
[02:42:35.690 --> 02:42:36.750]  Living in a free country?
[02:42:37.170 --> 02:42:39.752]  Do we allow America to be ruled by thugs?
[02:42:39.772 --> 02:42:40.972]  Sure, some years we do.
[02:42:42.773 --> 02:42:47.115]  I believe you stood before a flag that solemnly swore
[02:42:48.280 --> 02:42:55.364]  That you support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:42:55.404 --> 02:42:57.025]  I'll take your five minutes as well.
[02:42:57.165 --> 02:42:58.065]  Listen to me, son.
[02:43:00.827 --> 02:43:08.571]  I don't want you to turn on the TV next week and see the President there and know you could have done something about it.
[02:43:10.031 --> 02:43:11.132]  Don't do that to yourself.
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:19.640]  I'm going to talk to Timmons.
[02:43:19.780 --> 02:43:20.000]  Why?
[02:43:20.161 --> 02:43:22.381]  Because you're going to fire me if I do?
[02:43:22.441 --> 02:43:24.901]  Timmons was killed by a mugger in an alley last night.
[02:43:24.981 --> 02:43:26.122]  In a conspiracy, who sends a friend?
[02:43:26.162 --> 02:43:27.262]  Jack Ruby shoots Oswald?
[02:43:44.750 --> 02:43:46.772]  Bad things happen to good people.
[02:43:46.792 --> 02:43:48.052]  Yeah, not that quick, they don't.
[02:43:48.112 --> 02:43:49.594]  These are contractors.
[02:43:49.654 --> 02:43:50.674]  I can't tell what this is.
[02:43:50.714 --> 02:43:50.894]  Hey!
[02:43:50.954 --> 02:43:51.575]  Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[02:44:12.791 --> 02:44:16.233]  Seems I heard about a shot like that being made not too long ago.
[02:44:17.014 --> 02:44:19.676]  Said the guy's name was Bob Lee Swagger.
[02:44:20.316 --> 02:44:22.158]  Never met the man, so I wouldn't know.
[02:44:22.838 --> 02:44:23.779]  Yeah, they said that, alright.
[02:44:24.159 --> 02:44:33.585]  They also said that artificial sweeteners were safe, and WMDs were in Iraq, and Anna Nicole married for love!
[02:44:36.287 --> 02:44:37.948]  Would've been a bad job to take, though.
[02:44:37.968 --> 02:44:38.309]  Okay.
[02:44:39.272 --> 02:44:41.412]  Whoever took that shot is probably dead now.
[02:44:41.973 --> 02:44:43.293]  That's how conspiracy works.
[02:44:43.953 --> 02:44:47.114]  Them boys on the grass in the hole, they were dead within three hours.
[02:44:47.714 --> 02:44:51.334]  Buried in the damn desert, unmarked graves out past Turlingua.
[02:44:51.734 --> 02:44:52.675]  And you know this for a fact?
[02:44:53.295 --> 02:44:54.335]  Still got the shovel.
[02:44:55.415 --> 02:45:00.696]  Yeah, the world ain't what it seems, is it Gunny?
[02:45:02.017 --> 02:45:02.677]  No, sir.
[02:45:03.237 --> 02:45:04.297]  You keep that in mind.
[02:45:04.915 --> 02:45:07.516]  The moment you think you've got it figured, you're wrong.
[02:45:07.536 --> 02:45:10.017]  Take all suspicions away when you shoot someone.
[02:45:10.998 --> 02:45:13.039]  Wait till he's standing next to the president.
[02:45:13.379 --> 02:45:15.620]  What was he gonna say?
[02:45:17.161 --> 02:45:17.661]  The truth.
[02:45:18.721 --> 02:45:25.244]  That nothing, no matter how horrible, ever really happens without the approval of the government.
[02:45:26.024 --> 02:45:27.705]  Over there and here.
[02:45:30.086 --> 02:45:31.447]  The problem isn't the doing.
[02:45:33.371 --> 02:45:36.633]  It's the people in power having to admit that they knew.
[02:45:38.915 --> 02:45:40.976]  The prisoners are tortured at Abbey Grape.
[02:45:41.816 --> 02:45:43.698]  And only the underlings go to jail.
[02:45:44.678 --> 02:45:45.519]  Their boss is new.
[02:45:46.319 --> 02:45:47.780]  We know their boss is new.
[02:45:48.601 --> 02:45:53.424]  But you don't say?
[02:45:54.044 --> 02:45:54.845]  Who runs Johnson?
[02:45:55.385 --> 02:45:55.825]  Sillerton.
[02:45:56.266 --> 02:45:57.486]  From Montana, I think.
[02:45:59.648 --> 02:46:00.088]  Don't get it.
[02:46:01.331 --> 02:46:03.071]  There is no head to cut off.
[02:46:04.612 --> 02:46:06.592]  It's a conglomerate.
[02:46:07.033 --> 02:46:15.695]  If one of them betrays the principles of the accrual of money and power, the others betray him.
[02:46:17.395 --> 02:46:22.877]  What it is, is human weakness.
[02:46:24.897 --> 02:46:27.598]  You can't kill that with a gun.
[02:46:28.518 --> 02:46:30.459]  You got any plans after this?
[02:46:31.644 --> 02:46:33.545]  You have a rather unique skill set.
[02:46:33.565 --> 02:46:35.665]  I'd be interested in offering you a job.
[02:46:36.206 --> 02:46:36.486]  Work.
[02:46:37.566 --> 02:46:37.946]  For you.
[02:46:38.506 --> 02:46:40.147]  It's not really as bad as it seems.
[02:46:40.607 --> 02:46:41.608]  It's all gonna be done.
[02:46:41.628 --> 02:46:45.589]  In any case, you might as well be on the side that gets you well-paid for your efforts.
[02:46:46.029 --> 02:46:47.110]  And what side are you on?
[02:46:48.290 --> 02:46:49.310]  There are no sides.
[02:46:49.350 --> 02:46:51.071]  There's no Sunnis and Shiites.
[02:46:51.091 --> 02:46:52.491]  There's no Democrats and Republicans.
[02:46:52.532 --> 02:46:54.572]  There's only haves and have-nots.
[02:46:54.612 --> 02:46:59.354]  This is a country where the Secretary of Defense
[02:47:01.815 --> 02:47:08.177]  Can go on TV and tell the American public, oh, that this is about freedom.
[02:47:08.237 --> 02:47:09.437]  It's not about oil.
[02:47:09.457 --> 02:47:14.978]  And nobody questions him because they don't want to hear the answer because it's a lie.
[02:47:17.879 --> 02:47:21.060]  There's only so many places at the table, Gunny.
[02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:25.441]  Now, are you on the inside or are you on the out?
[02:47:26.941 --> 02:47:28.662]  Regardless of how I feel about this,
[02:47:30.057 --> 02:47:32.518]  These events occurred in another country, outside of our laws.
[02:47:33.058 --> 02:47:33.558]  So that's it?
[02:47:34.419 --> 02:47:35.339]  That's the best you can do?
[02:47:35.699 --> 02:47:37.100]  This isn't the world court, Sergeant.
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:43.182]  And I don't have the jurisdiction to detain the Colonel for crimes he may or may not have committed on another continent.
[02:47:43.802 --> 02:47:45.183]  Sir, I urge you to reconsider.
[02:47:45.203 --> 02:47:46.824]  There's nothing to reconsider, son.
[02:47:50.925 --> 02:47:51.285]  I win.
[02:47:52.586 --> 02:47:53.246]  You lose.
[02:47:54.647 --> 02:47:55.007]  Again.
[02:47:58.832 --> 02:48:02.693]  For the record, I don't like the way this turned out any more than you do.
[02:48:03.053 --> 02:48:04.354]  But this is the world we live in.
[02:48:05.194 --> 02:48:07.775]  And justice does not always prevail.
[02:48:07.795 --> 02:48:10.636]  It's not the Wild West where you can clean up the streets with a gun.
[02:48:13.037 --> 02:48:14.877]  Even though sometimes that's exactly what's needed.
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:26.181]  We've got to first identify who the New World Order is.
[02:48:26.561 --> 02:48:28.082]  We have to expose them.
[02:48:29.073 --> 02:48:33.141]  We have to educate everyone on the planet about who their real enemy is.
[02:48:33.962 --> 02:48:35.505]  Then they can be brought to justice.
[02:48:36.667 --> 02:48:38.230]  It's the only hope we've got.
[02:48:39.493 --> 02:48:41.516]  But don't forget, God's on our side.
[02:48:45.698 --> 02:48:51.147]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling the distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:51.508 --> 02:48:59.121]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:59.833 --> 02:49:06.897]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:07.277 --> 02:49:18.683]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:19.023 --> 02:49:22.705]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:22.985 --> 02:49:24.786]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:25.266 --> 02:49:29.028]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:45.832 --> 02:49:48.694]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:49:48.934 --> 02:49:55.119]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:50:43.030 --> 02:50:54.435]  A new cancer study conducted on 500 mice shows when they consumed MRET-activated water that it was nearly equal in effectiveness to chemotherapy, yet without toxic side effects.
[02:50:54.715 --> 02:51:07.741]  Another study done on mice intentionally infected with staphylococcal bacteria showed that 30% of those who drank regular water died from the infection, while 100% of the mice that drank MRET-activated water lived.
[02:51:07.961 --> 02:51:09.122]  The secret of MRET
[02:51:09.482 --> 02:51:10.263]  We're good to go.

[02:51:36.600 --> 02:51:40.023]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:51:40.543 --> 02:51:44.086]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[02:51:44.566 --> 02:51:45.727]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[02:51:46.327 --> 02:51:47.088]  It's a depression.
[02:51:48.269 --> 02:51:51.151]  Everybody's out of work, or scared of losing their job.
[02:51:52.563 --> 02:51:54.085]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[02:51:54.545 --> 02:51:55.566]  Banks are going bust.
[02:51:55.626 --> 02:51:57.569]  Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
[02:51:58.209 --> 02:52:02.414]  Punks are running wild in the street and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it!
[02:52:04.035 --> 02:52:04.416]  We know.
[02:52:04.876 --> 02:52:06.418]  The air is unfit to breathe.
[02:52:06.558 --> 02:52:07.960]  Our food is unfit to eat.
[02:52:08.686 --> 02:52:17.252]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
[02:52:17.552 --> 02:52:19.613]  We know things are bad, worse than bad.
[02:52:20.194 --> 02:52:20.934]  They're crazy.
[02:52:21.174 --> 02:52:24.176]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[02:52:24.557 --> 02:52:31.461]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[02:52:31.501 --> 02:52:35.864]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radios and I won't say anything.
[02:52:36.084 --> 02:52:36.885]  Just leave us alone.
[02:52:37.145 --> 02:52:38.506]  Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone.
[02:52:39.366 --> 02:52:40.527]  I want you to get mad!
[02:52:41.388 --> 02:52:42.628]  I don't want you to protest.
[02:52:42.748 --> 02:52:43.769]  I don't want you to riot.
[02:52:43.789 --> 02:52:46.730]  I don't want you to write to your congressmen because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[02:52:47.091 --> 02:52:51.393]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
[02:52:51.753 --> 02:52:54.255]  All I know is that first, you've got to get mad!
[02:52:54.715 --> 02:52:56.616]  You've got to say, I'm a human being!
[02:52:56.836 --> 02:52:58.037]  My life has value!
[02:52:59.658 --> 02:53:00.058]  I want you...
[02:53:01.033 --> 02:53:03.134]  I want you to get up now.
[02:53:03.154 --> 02:53:05.174]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[02:53:06.495 --> 02:53:16.658]  I want you to get up right now, and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'm as tired as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[02:53:16.738 --> 02:53:18.078]  Alright ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53:18.098 --> 02:53:19.498]  I want you to get up right now.
[02:53:20.239 --> 02:53:22.179]  Get up, go to your window.
[02:53:22.219 --> 02:53:23.540]  We got three minutes left.
[02:53:27.126 --> 02:53:29.248]  I want you to take action, folks.
[02:53:30.709 --> 02:53:36.132]  I want you to go to Infowars.com and get this in-game trailer and cram it out there to the four corners of the earth.
[02:53:36.773 --> 02:53:39.354]  I want you to get aggressive in the Info War.
[02:53:41.816 --> 02:53:43.937]  Alright, let's jam two final calls in here.
[02:53:44.198 --> 02:53:46.139]  I'll give you each about a minute and a half, Derek and Dave.
[02:53:46.559 --> 02:53:47.540]  Derek in St.
[02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:48.761]  Louis, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:53:49.521 --> 02:53:50.982]  Hello Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:53:51.723 --> 02:53:52.043]  Welcome.
[02:53:52.941 --> 02:53:57.327]  I would like to discuss real quickly about our young man, our young martyr, Brett Darrow here in St.
[02:53:57.347 --> 02:53:57.628]  Louis.
[02:53:58.829 --> 02:54:02.214]  That man is literally facing some serious times ahead of him.
[02:54:02.514 --> 02:54:05.619]  He is dealing with the most powerful police department in this state.
[02:54:07.168 --> 02:54:08.349]  These people are no joke.
[02:54:08.829 --> 02:54:16.055]  No, I know, and he's been documenting and videotaping the cops and now they're saying on their own message boards they want to kill him and give it out the map and now they're at his house.
[02:54:16.175 --> 02:54:16.775]  That's correct.
[02:54:17.315 --> 02:54:24.161]  I am personally trying to put together a committee of young citizens here with surveillance in their cars to follow around the Metropolitan Police Department.
[02:54:25.562 --> 02:54:26.642]  And I hope I'm successful.
[02:54:27.223 --> 02:54:30.025]  Maybe that'll stop some of the nonsense of them threatening this young man.
[02:54:31.943 --> 02:54:32.383]  I hear you.
[02:54:32.423 --> 02:54:33.104]  Good luck, my friend.
[02:54:33.124 --> 02:54:33.824]  What else is on your mind?
[02:54:34.084 --> 02:54:34.645]  Not too much.
[02:54:34.825 --> 02:54:41.008]  I mean, we're really trying to focus on him right now because he's a three-year-old kid and the police do not need to be threatening him.
[02:54:41.849 --> 02:54:43.770]  We're really going to try to do everything we can here in St.
[02:54:43.790 --> 02:54:44.510]  Louis to help him.
[02:54:45.611 --> 02:54:46.912]  You know, I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:54:47.112 --> 02:54:50.794]  We're really trying to fight... Well, I mean, you know, the establishment wants to surveil us.
[02:54:50.834 --> 02:54:51.935]  We're going to surveil them.
[02:54:52.255 --> 02:54:53.035]  We have to, Alex.
[02:54:53.055 --> 02:54:53.696]  That's the only way.
[02:54:54.861 --> 02:54:55.341]  The only way.
[02:54:55.382 --> 02:55:01.107]  I mean, here we are stuck and having to deal with their power struggles and them trying to take us over constantly.
[02:55:01.167 --> 02:55:02.888]  Eighty percent of the population, we all know.
[02:55:02.908 --> 02:55:04.229]  I mean, it's... I hear you.
[02:55:04.250 --> 02:55:04.990]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:55:05.010 --> 02:55:06.151]  Tell me more about what's happening in St.
[02:55:06.191 --> 02:55:06.451]  Louis.
[02:55:06.472 --> 02:55:07.112]  Good job there.
[02:55:07.773 --> 02:55:09.114]  Let's talk to Dave in Canada.
[02:55:09.134 --> 02:55:10.315]  Last caller, take us out of here.
[02:55:13.738 --> 02:55:14.098]  You there?
[02:55:14.259 --> 02:55:14.799]  Dave in Canada?
[02:55:14.819 --> 02:55:15.440]  Dave in Canada?
[02:55:16.501 --> 02:55:17.041]  I'm gonna drop him.
[02:55:17.061 --> 02:55:18.162]  He's got feedback on his line.
[02:55:18.182 --> 02:55:18.883]  Okay, we're out of time.
[02:55:18.903 --> 02:55:19.844]  I'm sorry to all the other callers.
[02:55:19.864 --> 02:55:20.844]  We don't have time to get to you.
[02:55:20.864 --> 02:55:21.245]  We're out of here.
[02:55:22.364 --> 02:55:24.085]  I want to thank all the MFM affiliates.
[02:55:24.105 --> 02:55:25.085]  I want to thank you, the listeners.
[02:55:25.746 --> 02:55:29.247]  I want to thank my family, the great folks here at my office in Austin, Texas.
[02:55:29.707 --> 02:55:31.948]  Deep in the heart of Texas, the fine folks at the Genesis Network.
[02:55:32.408 --> 02:55:39.011]  In the first hour I got into the New York Times, Bush signed a secret executive order ordering all the torture.
[02:55:40.032 --> 02:55:41.332]  He is absolutely culpable.
[02:55:42.053 --> 02:55:47.135]  They're sending people that followed orders to prison, gagging them with the Patriot Act so they can't defend themselves.
[02:55:48.217 --> 02:55:52.949]  And I'm not defending their torture, but imagine ordering the torture and then sending them to prison about it.
[02:55:54.015 --> 02:56:06.521]  This is big news, and when the show restarts on the web in 60 seconds after this show ends, you can tune in at InfoWars.com and miss that first hour while I walk through all this and a bunch of other news at InfoWars.com.

[02:56:18.066 --> 02:56:19.267]  See you back tomorrow!
