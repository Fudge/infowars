[00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:06.525]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:08.226]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.947 --> 00:00:10.067]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.707 --> 00:00:11.528]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.288 --> 00:00:13.169]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.651]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:22.113]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:36.996]  Well, it's been making headlines for the last three or four months.
[00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:39.837]  One of the biggest stories in the country.
[00:00:40.517 --> 00:00:46.819]  And that is a, well in her words, an escort service, in the media's words, a call girl operation.
[00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:48.799]  Much smaller in D.C.
[00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:52.080]  than the mail operations, which the politicians really like.
[00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:55.641]  But they've gone after her.
[00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:58.842]  And so she's standing up and saying, I'm releasing this phone list.
[00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.972]  Because this is extremely hypocritical, and she joins us to spend a full hour with us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:01:06.352 --> 00:01:09.953]  We'll take 30 minutes of calls on this subject.
[00:01:11.094 --> 00:01:13.675]  Jean, thank you so much for having the courage to come on the radio.
[00:01:17.937 --> 00:01:26.100]  We're going to break here in about three minutes, but in this short segment, just for those that don't know your story or your side of it, just in a nutshell, tell us basically what's happened.
[00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:57.019]  Well, from what I gather, and I'll try to compress it as much as I possibly can because it's a very convoluted and detailed story, but from what I gather, I was under investigation more or less, and it could have been prior to this, but more or less from March or so of 2004 until last October 4th of 2006 when there was a raid conducted on my home, a search warrant executed upon my home.
[00:01:57.634 --> 00:02:03.296]  Now, I'm going to use, I'm using the word investigated or investigation rather loosely here.
[00:02:04.036 --> 00:02:13.399]  It does not appear to have been an investigation into prostitution-related services or activities, since, oh by the way, prostitution is not a federal crime.
[00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:22.002]  It is left for the state, states in the lower state courts, I might say, to adjudicate.
[00:02:22.717 --> 00:02:26.280]  However, it's a local vice issue.
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.301]  It's a local vice issue, absolutely.
[00:02:29.462 --> 00:02:39.589]  What appears to have taken place, however, is some sort of a gathering of evidence on Deborah Jean Palfrey, sort of a la J. Edgar Hoover style.
[00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.752]  Personal information, financial information, and the like.
[00:02:44.192 --> 00:02:50.016]  There does not appear to have been any sort of actual investigation, from what I gather,
[00:02:50.427 --> 00:02:55.790]  And I am 10 months into this now, and I've gone through a civil process, now I'm into a criminal process.
[00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:07.635]  Well, I'll tell you from what I've seen in the past, and just instinctively I've seen this before, they may have been tracking what was going on with your business to use that without your knowledge for higher-ups to actually blackmail people.
[00:03:08.796 --> 00:03:12.638]  That's kind of my thinking, or something as nefarious as that.
[00:03:14.156 --> 00:03:15.838]  Or something as nefarious as that.
[00:03:15.898 --> 00:03:16.138]  Absolutely.
[00:03:16.158 --> 00:03:18.300]  That's exactly what we believe has occurred.
[00:03:18.861 --> 00:03:18.961]  Ah.
[00:03:19.682 --> 00:03:21.003]  You don't see that in the media.
[00:03:21.023 --> 00:03:21.724]  Please continue.
[00:03:22.384 --> 00:03:23.666]  No, you sure don't.
[00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:27.590]  And you're very on point with that observation.
[00:03:31.608 --> 00:03:34.410]  Why did they pull the trigger on October 4 last year?
[00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:44.558]  I mean, I could still be ongoing here, except I did a couple of unusual things last year, which I think whoever they are that were watching me became very concerned.
[00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:49.462]  Last July, I put my house of 15-16 years on the market.
[00:03:49.562 --> 00:04:00.791]  Simultaneously, within a few weeks, early August of last year, I closed my business, the one in question, Pamela Martin & Associates, which I had operated non-stop for 13 years.
[00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:05.559]  In some people's eyes, it would have been perceived as an unexpected move.
[00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:11.603]  So they thought maybe you were planning to kind of leave the Mafia, and they don't ever let you leave, kind of?
[00:04:11.683 --> 00:04:14.084]  You know, that's another very good observation.
[00:04:14.124 --> 00:04:24.871]  You know, as long as the status quo was ongoing, because I was so reliable, I was so dependable, I ran such a nice service, sort of in the style of the Mayflower Madam from New York from back in the 1980s.
[00:04:25.611 --> 00:04:28.933]  No drugs, we paid our taxes every year, believe it or not.
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.443]  Uh, everything was just so nicely done, and then I, all of a sudden, quit.
[00:04:34.523 --> 00:04:46.030]  Yeah, they got paranoid, and then, uh, the wicked flee when none pursueth, uh, basically because they were paranoid, now they've triggered what they were worried about.
[00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:56.577]  Or, perhaps they were trying to trigger a chain of events, because they had assessed you to cause you to stand up and fight back against them, because they had assessed you psychologically to run, now, a massive blackmailing operation.
[00:04:56.937 --> 00:04:57.377]  Stay with us.
[00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:58.398]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[00:05:04.608 --> 00:05:07.790]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.072]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.432 --> 00:05:18.097]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:25.821]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.222 --> 00:05:33.146]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.632]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.953 --> 00:05:41.535]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.915 --> 00:05:43.596]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.176 --> 00:05:48.119]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.391 --> 00:06:02.172]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.312 --> 00:06:03.052]  Terrorism!
[00:06:03.152 --> 00:06:09.237]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:06:09.477 --> 00:06:11.078]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:06:11.318 --> 00:06:13.820]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:20.265]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed
[00:06:20.305 --> 00:06:21.186]  We're good to go.

[00:07:01.027 --> 00:07:05.070]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.693]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:07:08.853 --> 00:07:12.376]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:07:12.616 --> 00:07:15.859]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:21.343]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[00:07:21.383 --> 00:07:26.608]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[00:07:27.008 --> 00:07:27.709]  We're good to go.
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.903]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:07:42.923 --> 00:07:44.304]  It'll work on other problems as well.

[00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.730]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:08.431]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.152 --> 00:08:10.273]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.953 --> 00:08:11.753]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.494 --> 00:08:13.374]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.394 --> 00:08:17.697]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.237 --> 00:08:22.360]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.862 --> 00:08:34.507]  Back in late 2001, when Fox News did a three-part series on Israeli spy rings in connection with 9-11,
[00:08:35.928 --> 00:08:37.049]  That was done for a reason.
[00:08:37.089 --> 00:08:37.930]  That was a threat.
[00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:44.494]  Whether it was Fox saying, give me more licenses, or get off my back, or don't audit me, as they were being at the time.
[00:08:45.175 --> 00:08:47.697]  Or whether that was the Bush administration saying something to Israel.
[00:08:48.057 --> 00:08:59.285]  When you see the New York Post come out and say that, what, three years ago that the Bohemian Grove busses in $2,000 an hour gay porn stars to service our Christian conservative leaders.
[00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:00.306]  We're good to go.
[00:09:11.132 --> 00:09:11.972]  We're good to go!
[00:09:37.806 --> 00:09:39.407]  Gene Palfrey is our guest.
[00:09:39.427 --> 00:09:40.468]  She's the big D.C.
[00:09:40.608 --> 00:09:43.390]  madam, ladies and gentlemen, and you've got the floor.
[00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:44.111]  Please continue.
[00:09:45.172 --> 00:09:48.154]  Well, you know, I wasn't part of the boys crowd here.
[00:09:49.175 --> 00:09:51.437]  If I was a member, I didn't know I was a member.
[00:09:51.697 --> 00:09:52.598]  Let me clarify that.
[00:09:52.618 --> 00:09:59.704]  That's what I mean, but once you've done business, once you become a fixture, they get real scared once they see you leave.
[00:10:00.535 --> 00:10:15.521]  You know, and I think that's exactly what happened, because not only did I put my house on the market in late July, unexpectedly closed the business in early August, a few months later I wired $70,000 on September 28th to Germany to buy a small retirement flat, a €100,000 flat, which is about $125,000.
[00:10:22.336 --> 00:10:45.702]  And this wire transfer was picked up on this Bush terrorist tracking program, all wires going into and out of the country, because the next day what appeared to have been, and again I use the word investigation very loosely, what appeared to have been some sort of two and a half plus year, 31 month investigation at this point in time, the next day on September 29th, the feds went into warp mode
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:46.900]  We're good to go.
[00:11:16.215 --> 00:11:22.179]  They were not identifying themselves as postal agents from the United States Postal Inspector's Office.
[00:11:22.459 --> 00:11:31.845]  They were identifying themselves as Joe and Maria, a couple... Yeah, that's extremely illegal for the Feds, without a warrant, to use some trick like calling your realtor to get in your house.
[00:11:33.168 --> 00:11:38.873]  They were identifying themselves as Joe and Maria, a couple being transferred from Washington D.C.
[00:11:38.913 --> 00:11:39.894]  to San Francisco.
[00:11:39.954 --> 00:11:40.994]  They loved my neighborhood.
[00:11:41.035 --> 00:11:43.757]  They loved my house because they see the house that afternoon.
[00:11:43.777 --> 00:11:45.338]  They had to see it that afternoon.
[00:11:45.658 --> 00:11:55.846]  Well, my agent had to tell them that her client was in Europe for another week and that, two, her client would not allow the house to be seen without being present and she did not have a key.
[00:11:56.607 --> 00:12:00.790]  At this point in time, I surmise that these two postal inspections
[00:12:01.363 --> 00:12:01.623]  Thank you
[00:12:31.553 --> 00:12:50.878]  Now, for your listening audience who may not understand, the probable cause that's necessary time-wise for a warrant, rarely are warrants issued on information any older than six months anywhere in this country in any type of situation.
[00:12:51.278 --> 00:12:54.979]  They went to this magistrate, they got a warrant based upon information
[00:12:55.492 --> 00:12:59.673]  Three to five years old, written in third person by Agent Maria Kuvion.
[00:12:59.733 --> 00:13:02.214]  And that's all because of the new anti-terror paradigm.
[00:13:02.254 --> 00:13:07.135]  That's how you originally had your wire transfer intercepted, was their own terror system.
[00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.076]  That's right, that's right.
[00:13:09.336 --> 00:13:10.216]  There's no question.
[00:13:10.516 --> 00:13:15.338]  There was no, in other words, there was no warrant at my bank, which was the Wells Fargo Bank at the time,
[00:13:16.088 --> 00:13:22.609]  Uh, uh, where I made the wire transfer from, from a money market account to an escrow agent over in Germany, the $70,000.
[00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.950]  There wasn't a probable cause.
[00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:31.171]  And by the way, anybody in two seconds could have gone and looked at that file and known that it was for a house, that it was an escrow agent.
[00:13:32.251 --> 00:13:33.772]  You would think, you would think.
[00:13:34.352 --> 00:13:40.673]  Nonetheless, nonetheless, they were able to obtain this warrant, this search warrant from this magistrate in Sacramento.
[00:13:41.193 --> 00:13:44.134]  They came in the next morning, they executed it.
[00:13:44.875 --> 00:13:54.443]  On Wednesday, October 4th, apparently from what I understand, because again I was not here, there were a dozen plus agents swarming all over this property.
[00:13:54.563 --> 00:13:58.887]  I can only assume with dogs it was quite the sight to see from what I understand.
[00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:06.654]  And in fact, didn't your security company call you and they said that when they called there was an agent on the phone?
[00:14:06.674 --> 00:14:07.254]  Tell that story.
[00:14:07.735 --> 00:14:10.837]  Oh yeah, that's kind of funny because you know when I realized
[00:14:12.202 --> 00:14:19.206]  What might be going on, I immediately checked my messages and my messages said that there was a phone call from ADT Security.
[00:14:19.246 --> 00:14:24.670]  So I immediately contacted ADT Security and I said to them, what's happening?
[00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:31.394]  And they said, well we just called and when the person picked up the phone, it was a man, it wasn't a woman, it wasn't you Ms.
[00:14:31.414 --> 00:14:32.294]  Palfrey, it was a man.
[00:14:32.754 --> 00:14:40.159]  And the man, when we asked the man for your password and what he was doing in the property, he could not give us your password or code.
[00:14:40.738 --> 00:14:48.163]  And we said we are calling the police and it's at that point that the man who was Agent Joe Clark, I believe, said, don't bother.
[00:14:48.604 --> 00:14:49.584]  We are the police.
[00:14:50.665 --> 00:14:53.187]  Now, how many different agencies were there?
[00:14:53.247 --> 00:14:54.588]  How many different federal departments?
[00:14:55.468 --> 00:14:57.350]  There were at least two that I know of.
[00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.292]  There were the Postal Inspectors and there was the IRS.
[00:15:01.873 --> 00:15:05.815]  And let me state for the record here, this is not a tax evasion case.
[00:15:05.855 --> 00:15:07.036]  This is not a tax case.
[00:15:07.076 --> 00:15:09.538]  I'm not being charged with tax evasion or
[00:15:09.989 --> 00:15:11.691]  Any sort of tax violation.
[00:15:12.152 --> 00:15:14.434]  I paid my taxes every March, April.
[00:15:15.556 --> 00:15:17.498]  Never once audited, never once questioned.
[00:15:17.518 --> 00:15:20.982]  Well, they have some of the most unconstitutional powers, so they're regularly used.
[00:15:21.563 --> 00:15:22.704]  Yes, that's correct.
[00:15:22.945 --> 00:15:23.565]  That's correct.
[00:15:24.947 --> 00:15:28.091]  Now, they've set the precedent to basically ignore the Bill of Rights, so where did it go from there?
[00:15:29.463 --> 00:15:32.287]  Well, they of course pulled the trigger.
[00:15:33.689 --> 00:15:40.478]  They froze all my property, all my assets, real estate, bank accounts, retirement accounts, brokerage accounts.
[00:15:40.538 --> 00:15:41.599]  They wiped me out.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.622]  They left me basically indigent.
[00:15:44.804 --> 00:15:47.906]  At this point in time, I get back to the United States.
[00:15:48.027 --> 00:15:51.469]  Long story short, I get back to the United States about a week later as scheduled.
[00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:53.410]  I had no idea what was going on.
[00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:58.193]  I thought when I actually landed at Dulles, of all places, in Washington, D.C.
[00:15:58.233 --> 00:16:01.775]  to clear customs, I was going to be arrested and taken into custody.
[00:16:02.156 --> 00:16:05.358]  At this point in time, it was only my property which had been arrested.
[00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.679]  Nonetheless, I got back to the United States.
[00:16:08.059 --> 00:16:10.381]  I was able to hire an attorney within a week or so.
[00:16:10.421 --> 00:16:13.143]  Mr. Sibley, I'm sure you've seen and heard of him in the news.
[00:16:14.831 --> 00:16:16.092]  He came to my rescue.
[00:16:16.112 --> 00:16:18.953]  He's one of the leading civil asset forfeiture attorneys in the country.
[00:16:18.973 --> 00:16:20.753]  He explained to me what I was being charged with.
[00:16:20.793 --> 00:16:21.574]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:16:21.594 --> 00:16:23.615]  I couldn't believe the government could do something like this.
[00:16:23.635 --> 00:16:24.475]  Now let's make this clear though.
[00:16:24.495 --> 00:16:31.177]  They grab everything you've got so you can't even defend yourself before you've ever even been in a court of law facing a jury.
[00:16:31.517 --> 00:16:35.079]  So they take everything you've got first, guilty until proven innocent.
[00:16:35.679 --> 00:16:36.639]  Oh that's absolutely right.
[00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:38.600]  And if you have any money left over
[00:16:39.244 --> 00:16:54.362]  Most attorneys, almost all attorneys, and this is why I think Mr. Sibley is just an angel who came to my rescue, most attorneys will not touch your case because if you ultimately lose, the government can take back that money from the attorney who you gave it to.
[00:16:54.402 --> 00:16:58.367]  So if they missed anything, and you give an attorney the missed money,
[00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:03.324]  Uh, the attorney may have to ultimately forfeit that if the case is lost.
[00:17:03.464 --> 00:17:11.087]  Now, by the way, the way this works is it started with British law and admiralty being able to seize enemy ships or other neutral ships aiding the enemy.
[00:17:11.107 --> 00:17:12.308]  Absolutely right.
[00:17:12.488 --> 00:17:13.449]  Then they brought it here.
[00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:15.169]  It's not constitutional.
[00:17:15.489 --> 00:17:16.290]  They just do it.
[00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.570]  They just do it.
[00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:20.312]  And it's getting worse and worse and worse.
[00:17:20.332 --> 00:17:20.892]  Go ahead, please.
[00:17:21.912 --> 00:17:23.873]  So, I hired Mr. Sibley.
[00:17:24.053 --> 00:17:25.214]  He comes to my rescue.
[00:17:25.234 --> 00:17:26.675]  He says, calm down, Gene.
[00:17:26.695 --> 00:17:27.876]  You have a great case here.
[00:17:27.896 --> 00:17:29.317]  I don't understand what's going on.
[00:17:29.617 --> 00:17:30.738]  He tries to get discovery.
[00:17:30.778 --> 00:17:32.619]  He tries to get the government to talk to him.
[00:17:32.959 --> 00:17:34.180]  The government won't speak to him.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.661]  The government won't give him discovery.
[00:17:36.162 --> 00:17:38.183]  The government even stood him up for an appointment.
[00:17:39.144 --> 00:17:43.446]  One of the first things he says to me is, Gene, I've been in this business for 25 years.
[00:17:43.486 --> 00:17:45.388]  I'm an expert in civil asset forfeiture.
[00:17:45.448 --> 00:17:46.829]  I have never seen a case like this.
[00:17:47.209 --> 00:17:51.632]  He said, usually the government is so anxious to tell you what they've got against
[00:17:52.393 --> 00:17:52.954]  The client.
[00:17:53.494 --> 00:17:55.155]  They practically throw it in your face.
[00:17:55.816 --> 00:17:59.158]  Here, they won't tell me anything, they won't speak to me, they won't do anything.
[00:17:59.798 --> 00:18:05.022]  We go back and forth, back and forth, trying to get them to talk to us, trying to submit motions to the court.
[00:18:05.402 --> 00:18:07.644]  We go through this process for five months.
[00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:12.287]  It's getting more and more profound as the weeks and months are going by.
[00:18:12.447 --> 00:18:18.031]  Finally, the government seeing that we are not going to bend, and I am not going to deal in any way, shape, or form.
[00:18:18.371 --> 00:18:20.873]  Because we're going to the government saying, look, what is it that you want?
[00:18:21.113 --> 00:18:22.434]  Do you want her to be queen for the day?
[00:18:22.674 --> 00:18:25.296]  Does she have some sort of information that you need?
[00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:28.099]  Say, uh, something about terrorism?
[00:18:28.139 --> 00:18:30.020]  Maybe terrorists who might have used her service?
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:30.781]  She'll come forward.
[00:18:30.821 --> 00:18:32.842]  You don't have to do this, uh, to her.
[00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:34.944]  She'll come forward of her own free will and volition.
[00:18:35.524 --> 00:18:38.166]  But the government wouldn't take our offers.
[00:18:38.206 --> 00:18:39.427]  We came to them three times.
[00:18:39.487 --> 00:18:43.090]  We came to them, we went to them in late October, early November.
[00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.872]  We went back to them in mid-January.
[00:18:44.892 --> 00:18:45.832]  Well, to break this down, folks.
[00:18:45.852 --> 00:18:46.713]  And then in February.
[00:18:46.873 --> 00:18:47.053]  Sure.
[00:18:49.867 --> 00:18:57.070]  Uh, your main line topless bars are basically, you know, their real business, most of them is prostitution, but the owners aren't even involved in it.
[00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:01.512]  They've got the girls, the girls are there because if they want to, they can go sleep with somebody for money.
[00:19:01.972 --> 00:19:05.374]  And I mean, is that a fair way of boiling down really what these escort services are as well?
[00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:12.197]  Uh, no, I wouldn't necessarily say that, but what I would say to the question of here is
[00:19:14.248 --> 00:19:17.970]  It doesn't even matter if prostitution is legal or illegal.
[00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.872]  Because the feds are involved and that's not even their purview, why did this happen?
[00:19:21.552 --> 00:19:22.072]  Exactly.
[00:19:22.132 --> 00:19:24.094]  I mean, this is not even of relevance.
[00:19:24.614 --> 00:19:26.715]  This is almost a smoke and mirrors game.
[00:19:26.735 --> 00:19:27.856]  No, I understand.
[00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:28.676]  So that's my question.
[00:19:28.776 --> 00:19:30.937]  Why are they so interested in you?
[00:19:31.057 --> 00:19:33.479]  Why did they do this?
[00:19:33.759 --> 00:19:36.160]  It's a riddle, but I think we can unravel it.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:36.960]  Stay there, Jean.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.244]  On the other side, I want to continue to go through this with you, and I want to talk about why you've gone public, why you've released the phone numbers,
[00:19:44.145 --> 00:19:49.350]  And where you think this is going in the future, we'll also open the phones up for our guests.
[00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:53.394]  We've got a link up to our website as well at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:53.554 --> 00:19:53.995]  Stay with us.

[00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:32.650]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals

[00:21:01.545 --> 00:21:02.506]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[00:21:02.526 --> 00:21:02.787]  July 23, 2007.
[00:21:03.087 --> 00:21:03.267]  Gold 682.50.
[00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:05.811]  Announced full coins can be purchased for $704.31, $347.45 for half, $173.73 for quarter.
[00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:06.211]  That's $704.31, $347.45, and $173.73.
[00:21:16.665 --> 00:21:22.371]  50% of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[00:21:22.471 --> 00:21:26.135]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels switching dollar to yen.
[00:21:26.195 --> 00:21:27.637]  Bad news for US currency.
[00:21:27.877 --> 00:21:30.039]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[00:21:30.199 --> 00:21:31.581]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[00:21:31.881 --> 00:21:32.121]  Call 800-686-2237
[00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.971]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:12.274]  Did you know that one of the 45 objectives of international communism was to have America become involved in free trade?
[00:22:12.834 --> 00:22:22.757]  Without tariffs on cheaply produced foreign goods, our manufacturing base, which would not be able to compete, would be forced to move their manufacturing plants overseas or to Mexico.
[00:22:23.458 --> 00:22:29.640]  This would throw millions of workers out of work and completely destroy the middle class that has made America great.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:38.007]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:05.376 --> 00:23:07.097]  So that you could wake up feeling renewed.
[00:23:07.638 --> 00:23:10.020]  But wouldn't it be nice to also wake up looking younger?

[00:23:25.812 --> 00:23:31.036]  It has real ingredients that have been shown to reduce the signs of aging and fight natural sun damage.
[00:23:31.697 --> 00:23:33.278]  All while you get a good night's sleep.

[00:23:52.235 --> 00:23:52.495]  Call 1-800-894-3418.
[00:23:52.515 --> 00:23:52.775]  That's 1-800-894-3418.
[00:24:14.111 --> 00:24:19.654]  Alright, so we've got the neocon government, the liberal government, they're all the same.
[00:24:22.615 --> 00:24:28.258]  Just mainline hookers are more common than water fountains as they've said in Washington D.C.
[00:24:28.298 --> 00:24:29.218]  and across the country.
[00:24:29.979 --> 00:24:31.099]  Especially with the elites.
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.461]  I mean, it's come out about the CIA director, remember?
[00:24:35.246 --> 00:24:37.847]  Gosh, up there at the Watergate with a whole floor.
[00:24:37.967 --> 00:24:41.848]  One floor was the women, the next floor was the gambling and the booze and the drugs.
[00:24:42.988 --> 00:24:49.609]  I mean, what Deborah Jean Palfrey was doing paled in significance.
[00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:52.690]  So why the bizarre activities here?
[00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:57.271]  And I have to tell you, and I'm not sure of this, but probability-wise, it fits the MO
[00:24:58.335 --> 00:25:10.183]  Some intelligence group, some substratum, there's a bunch of different mafias that all are within the system, kind of nexus at the top though, that are using this as a massive fleshing exercise.
[00:25:10.223 --> 00:25:17.688]  I think probably arresting her with some shot across, or going after her, seizing her assets with some shot across the bow at somebody.
[00:25:18.168 --> 00:25:20.070]  And now it looks like it's gotten out of control.
[00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.852]  And sometimes it's the smallest bungles that bring systems down.
[00:25:23.872 --> 00:25:25.453]  This could be like the Watergate burglary.
[00:25:25.934 --> 00:25:27.755]  I could have just been some overzealous
[00:25:29.202 --> 00:25:34.626]  Government agents, postal inspectors wanting a terrorism collar and bumping into the big DC madam.
[00:25:35.967 --> 00:25:37.248]  We've got links up to her website.
[00:25:37.268 --> 00:25:42.131]  We can learn more, see the phone numbers and also try to help her in her defense.
[00:25:43.132 --> 00:25:49.977]  She's certainly having her rights violated and you can do that at Deborah Jean Palfrey, P-A-L-F-E.
[00:25:51.418 --> 00:25:56.341]  That's Deborah Jean Palfrey, P-A-L-F-R-E-Y.com or just go to InfoWorks.com.
[00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:58.583]  We've got a big link right there underneath her picture.
[00:25:59.335 --> 00:25:59.836]  I don't think so.
[00:26:16.337 --> 00:26:17.498]  I'll make you have an accident.
[00:26:18.098 --> 00:26:25.924]  Now, in the words of Jennifer Flowers, Bill Clinton's girlfriend, or bimbo, she went on Larry King Live and Hardball and said, they're killing people.
[00:26:25.964 --> 00:26:26.985]  And they said, why are you saying that?
[00:26:27.005 --> 00:26:27.506]  They'll kill you.
[00:26:27.546 --> 00:26:29.367]  And she said, no, I'm going public.
[00:26:29.407 --> 00:26:30.888]  I'm putting all my cards on the table.
[00:26:31.188 --> 00:26:31.909]  That protects me.
[00:26:31.949 --> 00:26:34.631]  Which, in my experience, it actually is a safer course.
[00:26:34.651 --> 00:26:36.973]  But let me ask you, why did you decide to go public?
[00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:40.772]  Well, I decided to go public for two reasons.
[00:26:40.892 --> 00:26:47.717]  One, the hypocrisy aspect, and that's been played out with Senator Vitter and certainly was played out with Randall Tobias a couple of months ago.
[00:26:48.258 --> 00:27:00.167]  And for all the very things that you are alleging right now, you are saying everything that my attorney and I and others behind the scenes have been saying for quite a while now.
[00:27:01.028 --> 00:27:04.691]  The two reasons, the hypocrisy and the susceptibility to blackmail.
[00:27:06.698 --> 00:27:11.400]  I mean, you could be blackmailed forever, and then there's all these powerful people that are afraid of what info's coming out.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.502]  You're the only one that can really confirm if that number was accurate.
[00:27:14.882 --> 00:27:15.922]  You had to go public.
[00:27:17.423 --> 00:27:18.644]  In some respects, I did.
[00:27:18.664 --> 00:27:22.065]  I have not feared for my life.
[00:27:22.866 --> 00:27:28.068]  I feel that I'm being protected somehow, someway here, either by God or by somebody.
[00:27:29.289 --> 00:27:33.211]  Thus far, I'm fine, but you're absolutely right by putting the numbers out there.
[00:27:34.215 --> 00:27:35.436]  That's it.
[00:27:35.716 --> 00:27:39.137]  There's nothing more that they could take from me or get from me.
[00:27:40.457 --> 00:27:44.439]  Did you ever see any evidence that somebody high up was trying to get the pressure off of you?
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.000]  No.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.360]  Nobody has come to my rescue.
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.561]  Absolutely no one.
[00:27:48.861 --> 00:27:52.242]  So they use the service, but then they're more than happy to flush you down the toilet.
[00:27:53.182 --> 00:27:53.983]  It seems that way.
[00:27:55.663 --> 00:27:56.664]  It sure seems that way.
[00:27:56.744 --> 00:27:58.184]  I had about 10,000 or so clients who
[00:28:00.063 --> 00:28:05.088]  It's estimated to use my service in 133 or so women who apparently worked for me over the years.
[00:28:05.508 --> 00:28:10.713]  Not one, except for a gal who worked for me in the mid-nineties, has come forward to say, I want to help you.
[00:28:10.913 --> 00:28:18.120]  Now why don't they arrest Fox News reporter, uh, why don't they, Jeff Gannon, why don't they go get him?
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.522]  I mean, he was bringing male prostitutes in.
[00:28:20.562 --> 00:28:22.544]  He's a, he does gay video.
[00:28:22.824 --> 00:28:25.787]  He's he, he was, he was running a string of, uh,
[00:28:26.494 --> 00:28:28.995]  String of horses under him.
[00:28:29.655 --> 00:28:31.516]  Why haven't they arrested the Fox News reporter?
[00:28:32.036 --> 00:28:45.241]  Well, you know, why haven't they arrested the hundreds and hundreds of other escort services that have been in operation all along from the onset of my debacle last October until now and on all the ones that were in operation prior to this.
[00:28:45.701 --> 00:28:47.782]  You know, they haven't gone after anyone but me.
[00:28:48.663 --> 00:28:49.743]  They haven't gone after the clients.
[00:28:50.345 --> 00:28:58.087]  They haven't gone after the girls, and they haven't gone after the hundreds of other agencies, services, businesses, independents in the Washington and D.C.
[00:28:58.107 --> 00:28:58.967]  Baltimore area.
[00:29:00.667 --> 00:29:01.407]  Just a question.
[00:29:01.487 --> 00:29:13.190]  I know you ran women, but it just seems from my study and what we keep seeing pop up that Republicans tend to be more on the gay side than Democrats.
[00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:14.290]  I don't know about that.
[00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:17.931]  I seem to think that as well by reading news reports.
[00:29:18.519 --> 00:29:22.403]  But my agency was strictly a heterosexual agency.
[00:29:22.764 --> 00:29:23.825]  Women for men.
[00:29:24.045 --> 00:29:25.186]  Well, that may be the problem.
[00:29:25.226 --> 00:29:28.009]  That probably upsets some people high up in the administration.
[00:29:28.349 --> 00:29:30.011]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:29:30.051 --> 00:29:31.753]  Maybe you weren't providing what they liked.
[00:29:31.773 --> 00:29:34.396]  Alright, I'm gonna... That's just unbelievable.
[00:29:34.816 --> 00:29:37.557]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side.
[00:29:37.577 --> 00:29:40.597]  But the lady's got a lot of courage, whether she knows it or not.
[00:29:41.017 --> 00:29:42.098]  She's Jean Palfrey.
[00:29:42.538 --> 00:29:45.378]  And you can simply go to Infowars.com and link to her site.
[00:29:45.638 --> 00:29:46.118]  Stay with us.
[00:29:46.318 --> 00:29:49.319]  Lots of other key questions and answers straight ahead in your phone calls.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.580]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:54.620]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.221]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.156 --> 00:30:08.972]  You want to lose weight, but there's no way you want to resort to pills or shakes that are full of chemicals or drugs with harmful side effects.
[00:30:09.457 --> 00:30:10.738]  We know diets don't work.
[00:30:11.018 --> 00:30:12.899]  That's why there's the Fat Loss Patch.
[00:30:13.079 --> 00:30:20.103]  The Fat Loss Patch is a self-adhesive dietary aid worn daily that slowly releases all natural ingredients into the skin.
[00:30:20.304 --> 00:30:27.808]  The result is a safe and easy way for you to increase your energy levels, maintain a healthy body weight, and curb those horrible sugar cravings.
[00:30:28.188 --> 00:30:30.950]  All without irritating side effects or loss of muscle.
[00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:34.072]  Just peel it off, stick it on, and live your life!
[00:30:34.532 --> 00:30:37.373]  The Patch is safe, effective, and clinically tested.
[00:30:37.513 --> 00:30:42.354]  Also, the Fat Loss Patch is the most unique product and business opportunity to ever hit the U.S.
[00:30:42.494 --> 00:30:43.675]  and international markets.
[00:30:44.135 --> 00:30:45.035]  Join as a U.S.
[00:30:45.135 --> 00:30:49.497]  or European customer or distributor in this much-needed and fast-growing business.
[00:30:49.817 --> 00:30:53.838]  For more information, visit PatchMeeting.com or call Judy at 800-766-2133.
[00:30:53.958 --> 00:30:54.178]  That's 800-766-2133.
[00:31:01.425 --> 00:31:05.987]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:31:06.387 --> 00:31:09.329]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:12.230]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:17.392]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:31:17.772 --> 00:31:23.155]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:31:23.455 --> 00:31:26.416]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[00:31:26.596 --> 00:31:27.176]  We're good to go.
[00:31:50.001 --> 00:31:55.205]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your free books and a free DVD call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:31:55.225 --> 00:31:55.566]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:32:02.273 --> 00:32:06.115]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[00:32:06.375 --> 00:32:10.237]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[00:32:10.598 --> 00:32:15.621]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[00:32:15.901 --> 00:32:27.087]  Electrolyzed Plus Water will alkalize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens, become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.
[00:32:27.427 --> 00:32:31.769]  Electrolyzed water is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and environmentally safe for humans and animals.
[00:32:32.009 --> 00:32:41.333]  Alkaline water is available as a concentrate to be mixed with good, filtered, purified RO water but not tap water, micro-structured alkaline antioxidant water for consumption.
[00:32:41.493 --> 00:32:49.376]  Call for your Electrolyzed Plus Alkalinizing Miracle Rejuvenating Water Concentrate or other remarkable RPA Biotech products like Ultimate Fuel,
[00:32:49.736 --> 00:32:51.239]  Sport Performance Drink at 888-212-8871.
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:51.640]  That's 888-212-8871.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:52.863]  Or go to Nutramedical.com.
[00:32:52.903 --> 00:32:54.526]  That's N-U-T-R-I with an I, medical.com.
[00:33:04.847 --> 00:33:13.496]  Our guest has agreed to stay with us for about 20 minutes into the next hour so we have more time to take your calls.
[00:33:13.857 --> 00:33:24.348]  Your calls are coming up in about 10-15 minutes specifically on the DC Madam case and just overall espionage using sex as their main mode.
[00:33:25.205 --> 00:33:32.789]  But I tell you, the stuff going on here is extremely tame compared to what's going on right now at Bohemian Grove in Northern California.
[00:33:32.809 --> 00:33:39.874]  So it's a mystery as to why this all happened, but it has the marks of espionage and blackmail all over it.
[00:33:41.595 --> 00:33:48.499]  Now, before we go back to our guest, I want to tell all the listeners about Storable Foods.
[00:33:48.639 --> 00:33:51.540]  Now, it's not that you're living in fear that you do this.
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.261]  You do this because you're in charge.
[00:33:53.361 --> 00:33:54.402]  You're taking control of your life.
[00:33:55.449 --> 00:33:59.473]  I have three separate purchases of food I've made in the last eight, nine years.
[00:34:00.053 --> 00:34:01.294]  One of them is only a few months old.
[00:34:01.334 --> 00:34:02.556]  The other is about eight years old.
[00:34:03.336 --> 00:34:04.577]  It may last more than ten years.
[00:34:05.158 --> 00:34:06.219]  High quality, storable foods.
[00:34:06.239 --> 00:34:12.344]  If there's a hurricane, or a depression, or a breakdown of society, all the things we hear about, I can eat my investment.
[00:34:12.584 --> 00:34:16.768]  In fact, some of my stuff got to be about five years old.
[00:34:16.788 --> 00:34:22.593]  I just gave it away to family, and they're going to use it when they're camping out and eating, or for another four or five years if they have an emergency.
[00:34:23.203 --> 00:34:25.166]  I mean, this is the type of insurance you can eat.
[00:34:25.186 --> 00:34:30.295]  It's the highest quality, the oldest continual company in the United States, the J. Michael Stevens Group.
[00:34:31.383 --> 00:34:33.465]  And I certainly hope that you'll give them a call.
[00:34:33.505 --> 00:34:34.585]  I mean, look at the Superdome.
[00:34:34.625 --> 00:34:35.666]  Look at what happened in New Orleans.
[00:34:36.107 --> 00:34:40.049]  If you don't have food, the government can bring in total control over you and your family.
[00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:42.611]  And they're openly talking about using food as a weapon.
[00:34:42.831 --> 00:34:45.433]  They're talking about really cracking down on this country.
[00:34:45.513 --> 00:34:46.334]  I hope it doesn't happen.
[00:34:46.354 --> 00:34:48.315]  The point is, if it does, I'm ready.
[00:34:48.876 --> 00:34:50.157]  And you need to give them a call.
[00:34:50.197 --> 00:34:52.559]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:34:52.579 --> 00:34:55.861]  You'll never have to turn your guns in to get food if you have the terrible foods.
[00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:57.831]  And it's 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[00:34:57.891 --> 00:34:59.252]  Again, that's efoodsdirect.com, or 1-800-409-5633.
[00:34:59.272 --> 00:35:01.713]  And you can call up, get a catalog, food samples, things like that.
[00:35:01.733 --> 00:35:03.574]  It's so important.
[00:35:03.654 --> 00:35:08.837]  Also, it's just going crazy at the bookstore right now at infowars.com.
[00:35:22.446 --> 00:35:24.427]  And I'm glad because we need to get this information out.
[00:35:24.547 --> 00:35:28.170]  The late great USA, the coming merger with Mexico and Canada.
[00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:29.971]  We have it for $19.95.
[00:35:30.551 --> 00:35:32.132]  I heard it being sold on the radio this morning for $28.
[00:35:32.432 --> 00:35:35.114]  It's $26 in stores.
[00:35:35.134 --> 00:35:37.856]  $19.95 at Infowars.com.
[00:35:38.676 --> 00:35:43.219]  The late great USA, the coming merger with Mexico and Canada.
[00:35:43.639 --> 00:35:47.422]  The European Union was put into place incrementally over 50 years and now
[00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:53.692]  It's happening here with a North American Union, not by the citizens of the member states.
[00:35:53.712 --> 00:35:58.753]  It's being done by stealth, and Dr. Jerome Corsi's done a fabulous job putting all this together.
[00:35:58.773 --> 00:36:06.296]  The late, great USA, the coming merger with Mexico and Canada, available at a discounted price, out of the gates, at InfoWars.com.
[00:36:06.676 --> 00:36:12.718]  Also, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, final cut, the special edition I put out one year after the first release.
[00:36:13.298 --> 00:36:20.104]  is available at InfoWars.com and now shipping, ladies and gentlemen, now shipping, and your orders are going out within 24 hours.
[00:36:20.204 --> 00:36:21.865]  We've got a great shipping department here.
[00:36:22.305 --> 00:36:30.812]  Terror Storm now available, Loose Chain 2nd Edition, America Freedom to Fascism discounted massively, all at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:36:30.952 --> 00:36:40.059]  Alright, Paul and Texas and many others that are holding, we're going to get to your calls in a few minutes, but I want to go back to our guests.
[00:36:41.131 --> 00:36:47.433]  Jean, any other facets or areas I haven't brought up or important points or parts of the story that people should know about?
[00:36:47.453 --> 00:36:49.334]  Oh, well, there are many.
[00:36:50.234 --> 00:36:59.037]  But I think you're hitting on the main aspects here of how truly twisted and puzzling and bizarre this situation is.
[00:36:59.337 --> 00:37:01.538]  This is not a case about prostitution.
[00:37:01.578 --> 00:37:03.959]  It never was, it isn't now, and it never will be.
[00:37:04.299 --> 00:37:06.420]  There's something very rotten at the core of all this.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.641]  And yes, there is something that comes to mind.
[00:37:09.261 --> 00:37:09.581]  Why
[00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:13.170]  Hasn't this case really come to light?
[00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:16.031]  And it still hasn't come to light, even as we speak.
[00:37:16.492 --> 00:37:19.333]  The mainstream media pays no attention to this.
[00:37:19.773 --> 00:37:26.776]  My attorney, Mr. Sibley, my civil attorney, Mr. Sibley and I have persisted for months and months and months trying to get this story out.
[00:37:27.217 --> 00:37:29.838]  Nobody wants to listen to us in the mainstream media.
[00:37:30.478 --> 00:37:39.382]  Interestingly, when we put the records out for availability the other week, the Washington Post nor the New York Times came to us.
[00:37:39.895 --> 00:37:44.877]  Very few of the main media outlets or the press came to us.
[00:37:44.957 --> 00:37:48.979]  That's because half of them use similar services and that's what's so hypocritical.
[00:37:49.019 --> 00:37:57.763]  They'll stand by while you that just ran an escort service, and again we're not debating the moral things here folks, we're just putting it out there.
[00:37:58.123 --> 00:38:03.626]  They can all use it and they can all be involved and they're not going to say a word while you're being ruined.
[00:38:04.562 --> 00:38:16.434]  I don't understand why they are not coming forward, because we keep telling them that there is more to this story than prostitution, that this is a very peculiar situation that involves constitutional and civil rights abuses.
[00:38:17.245 --> 00:38:18.106]  Please look at it.
[00:38:18.346 --> 00:38:19.626]  They just don't seem to be interested.
[00:38:19.646 --> 00:38:25.169]  Well, I mean, they're bought and paid for by the same military industrial complex that runs brothels right there at the Watergate right now, 24-7.
[00:38:25.189 --> 00:38:30.192]  So, I mean, we know why they're not doing this, and they know it goes all the way to the top.
[00:38:30.592 --> 00:38:34.935]  The question is, why did they initiate this and force you to then defend yourself?
[00:38:35.455 --> 00:38:44.740]  Well, you know, your point a little while ago about how this should never have come out, that this was something bungled, like the Watergate burglary was bungled years ago.
[00:38:45.273 --> 00:38:50.096]  And if it wasn't for the bungled burglary, perhaps Watergate never would have surfaced.
[00:38:50.616 --> 00:38:52.718]  This may be a very similar situation.
[00:38:52.738 --> 00:39:06.586]  But I still contend, and I will continue to contend forever, most likely, that Joe and Maria came out here only on a fishing expedition, and when they couldn't gain access to my property, because I was in Germany, the realtor couldn't let them in,
[00:39:07.068 --> 00:39:07.428]  That's amazing!
[00:39:20.552 --> 00:39:24.474]  I mean, I know you're not here talking about names or ratting out.
[00:39:24.915 --> 00:39:28.677]  You're just putting out the phone numbers that were brought into the court case.
[00:39:29.557 --> 00:39:38.142]  But I mean, how high, or any other little tidbits you can give us you haven't yet talked about, how high does this go or any other facets?
[00:39:39.102 --> 00:39:41.184]  Well, you know, I don't know how high it goes.
[00:39:41.624 --> 00:39:47.087]  I'm learning more about my clients through the media than I probably knew about them during the 13 years that I actually knew them.
[00:39:47.854 --> 00:39:51.337]  But we now know it goes as high as at least a United States Senator.
[00:39:51.777 --> 00:40:00.384]  I'm hearing rumors of similar from other people, that there are other possibilities in that stratosphere, so to speak, on that level.
[00:40:00.404 --> 00:40:01.925]  I don't know.
[00:40:01.945 --> 00:40:04.547]  I do know that there are a tremendous amount of lobbyists.
[00:40:05.047 --> 00:40:16.436]  There are all sorts of people, I think, here who, and I estimate anywhere between a couple of dozen to a hundred or so people, who will be noteworthy individuals exposed before this is all over.
[00:40:17.032 --> 00:40:21.614]  Most of these people are sort of like a Harlan Ullman or Randall Tobias.
[00:40:21.674 --> 00:40:26.456]  Harlan Ullman was Mr. Shock and Awe, and Randall Tobias was the former Deputy Secretary of State.
[00:40:26.937 --> 00:40:28.197]  Not household names.
[00:40:28.517 --> 00:40:29.258]  Not household names.
[00:40:29.558 --> 00:40:31.879]  But the people who are really the movers and shakers.
[00:40:31.899 --> 00:40:35.641]  Yeah, the actual technocrats that are really pulling the string, setting the policy.
[00:40:35.961 --> 00:40:36.501]  That's right.
[00:40:36.561 --> 00:40:39.803]  And I anticipate anywhere between a few dozen to a hundred or so.
[00:40:40.123 --> 00:40:42.424]  Are there going to be some big names that come out of this?
[00:40:43.364 --> 00:40:44.045]  I wouldn't doubt it.
[00:40:44.185 --> 00:40:45.205]  I really wouldn't doubt it.
[00:40:45.385 --> 00:40:46.666]  You know, we also have
[00:40:47.168 --> 00:40:53.630]  You know, off to the side here, we have Mr. Larry Flint, who has his own little operation going on.
[00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:56.031]  He's trying to out various hypocrites.
[00:40:56.871 --> 00:41:00.813]  He is not connected to me, except through a mutual acquaintance.
[00:41:01.333 --> 00:41:05.354]  Other than that, Mr. Flint is off doing more or less his own thing here.
[00:41:05.895 --> 00:41:15.818]  And he claims, according to his statement on Larry Flint the other night, he claims that there are approximately, he has approximately 30 or so individuals
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.560]  Who he is going to be bringing forward.
[00:41:18.961 --> 00:41:23.942]  This is coming from that Washington Post ad that he put out all about a month and a half or so ago.
[00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:29.703]  He started with 300 solid leads and he is down to about 30 or so.
[00:41:29.723 --> 00:41:33.363]  300 leads and he's down to about 30 or so solid leads now.
[00:41:33.743 --> 00:41:35.544]  Well, I've known a lot of young women.
[00:41:35.564 --> 00:41:39.745]  I grew up around in Dallas and Austin, Texas who moved to D.C.
[00:41:39.865 --> 00:41:40.845]  or ended up in D.C.
[00:41:41.645 --> 00:41:44.746]  and they said they were propositioned repeatedly to join, you know, these things.
[00:41:44.766 --> 00:41:45.986]  It's such a big industry.
[00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:56.193]  What is it about Washington that they seem to have, kind of like New Orleans is known for this as well, but also the biggest consumers of alcohol.
[00:41:56.653 --> 00:42:01.595]  Why does he see such a big consumer of the sex trade?
[00:42:02.395 --> 00:42:04.316]  Well, you know, I don't know if it is or if it isn't.
[00:42:05.496 --> 00:42:09.938]  I don't know if it's any different from Atlanta or any other city or town in this country.
[00:42:10.318 --> 00:42:12.499]  Although, perhaps it might be because of power.
[00:42:13.119 --> 00:42:15.320]  Because of the power, because there is the money there.
[00:42:16.844 --> 00:42:19.346]  You know, Randall Tobias, you know, the arrogance also.
[00:42:19.606 --> 00:42:22.987]  He made the statement, ordering an escort is like ordering a pizza.
[00:42:23.068 --> 00:42:24.068]  It's no more difficult.
[00:42:24.788 --> 00:42:28.010]  I mean, there's a certain amount of arrogance and power with some of these folks.
[00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:35.274]  So maybe there's a point that, you know, it may be a more active city in this regard.
[00:42:35.294 --> 00:42:38.356]  Well, obviously, I think you hit the nail on the head.
[00:42:38.396 --> 00:42:39.056]  It's the money.
[00:42:39.216 --> 00:42:40.417]  It's the power.
[00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:43.940]  Where does it go from here?
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.681]  I mean, what are you hoping to see resolved?
[00:42:47.741 --> 00:42:51.082]  What would you, I mean, in a perfect world, how would things remedy themselves?
[00:42:51.262 --> 00:42:52.562]  Well, I have an excellent case.
[00:42:52.662 --> 00:43:02.445]  You know, I really have an excellent case on so many levels and in so many ways, and I have numerous motions before the court right now, any one of which could kill this case quickly.
[00:43:02.945 --> 00:43:06.546]  It's before, all these motions are before Judge Glass-Kessler.
[00:43:06.606 --> 00:43:10.087]  Judge Kessler is a 70-ish year old woman about to retire.
[00:43:10.595 --> 00:43:17.762]  She's the protege of Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Ginsburg, Justice Ginsburg.
[00:43:18.402 --> 00:43:19.823]  She comes from that old school.
[00:43:19.883 --> 00:43:26.950]  She's a Clinton appointee, Harvard grad, brilliant woman, a very patient and methodical woman.
[00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:32.775]  I have a great deal of faith in this woman that she is going to infuse some sanity in this situation.
[00:43:33.195 --> 00:43:35.558]  She is the lady who did lift the injunction on the
[00:43:36.331 --> 00:43:42.233]  The phone records, and that was a mighty brave move on her part, and she understood what the ramifications of that move would be.
[00:43:42.253 --> 00:43:46.335]  Total, total, how many, I mean, what's the dollar amount on the assets they've stolen from you?
[00:43:47.576 --> 00:43:52.578]  About a million and a half, perhaps a little bit more, a million and three quarters, depending upon market value.
[00:43:53.538 --> 00:43:56.179]  So we're talking a million and a half plus here.
[00:43:56.779 --> 00:43:58.080]  How's your legal defense fund going?
[00:43:59.156 --> 00:44:01.238]  Well, I'm not accepting any money from that.
[00:44:01.818 --> 00:44:06.642]  We're redoing the site as we speak, and we're taking the legal defense part off of there.
[00:44:06.842 --> 00:44:19.752]  I took some monies for the first month or so, and after taking some $5 and $10 donations from people who you knew, who I knew, $5 and $10 meant a lot to, I just decided, you know, I can't do this in good conscience.
[00:44:20.433 --> 00:44:29.081]  However, the court has appointed, because I am an indigent person, the court has appointed a first-rate attorney to me, Preston Burton, a criminal attorney.
[00:44:29.502 --> 00:44:33.365]  He represented Monica Lewinsky during the Bill Clinton impeachment.
[00:44:33.746 --> 00:44:43.315]  He also represented Robert Hanson, the fellow, the FBI bad actor, the recent movie breach, and he also represented Aldrich James back in the 90s.
[00:44:44.347 --> 00:44:47.588]  So, this woman has been very, very good to me, Judge Kessler.
[00:44:47.908 --> 00:44:51.790]  She's appointed... Sounds like she appointed you a pretty high-powered... She sure did.
[00:44:51.890 --> 00:45:03.114]  She appointed about as good an attorney as I could get to get me, I hope, get me the representation that I need to give her, I hope, the tools that she needs to help us all get out of this.
[00:45:03.154 --> 00:45:05.295]  Well, sounds like that lawyer's got some big connections.
[00:45:05.315 --> 00:45:08.236]  You're going to find out real quick if the establishment wants this to go away.
[00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:15.291]  I think that Judge Kessler, more than anything, is a very fair woman.
[00:45:15.771 --> 00:45:19.332]  Again, she did lift the injunction on the court record, or on the phone record.
[00:45:19.472 --> 00:45:21.433]  That was a big statement right then and there.
[00:45:22.033 --> 00:45:26.674]  And Mr. Burton has written some fabulous legal motions.
[00:45:26.774 --> 00:45:27.554]  Have you been in court?
[00:45:27.574 --> 00:45:31.195]  Have you seen these different government federal agents?
[00:45:31.215 --> 00:45:31.975]  Have you talked to them?
[00:45:32.335 --> 00:45:33.776]  Oh yeah, oh sure, sure.
[00:45:33.916 --> 00:45:35.756]  I've put faces to names.
[00:45:36.292 --> 00:45:40.795]  A long ago, and they're all about 30 years of age, give or take.
[00:45:40.815 --> 00:45:44.717]  Now they've got a huge crop of really young agents out there, don't they?
[00:45:44.977 --> 00:45:46.338]  They sure do, they sure do.
[00:45:46.398 --> 00:45:59.425]  And that's what amazed me, because when I kept seeing these names, Troy Burroughs from the IRS, and Maria Kubion from the Postal Inspector's Office, I mean, I was imagining in my mind 35, 40 plus year old men and women.
[00:46:00.926 --> 00:46:02.987]  And when I met them, they were about 28 years of age.
[00:46:06.278 --> 00:46:08.659]  If they are any older, I mean, I would be floored.
[00:46:08.939 --> 00:46:10.079]  I mean, they look 21.
[00:46:10.179 --> 00:46:12.540]  Well, I'm not knocking young people, I mean, I'm pretty young.
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.120]  I'm not either, but you don't have, you need some expertise.
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:15.640]  Oh, no, I agree.
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.981]  You need some experience for this kind of a situation.
[00:46:18.041 --> 00:46:25.583]  The image of an FBI agent or a high-level IRS criminal investigator is, you know, 55-year-old man or woman, gray hair, real serious.
[00:46:26.023 --> 00:46:28.163]  And, no, I've been out at events and covered things and seen it.
[00:46:28.223 --> 00:46:30.784]  I mean, Secret Service that look like babies.
[00:46:31.324 --> 00:46:32.744]  And FBI that look like babies.
[00:46:32.784 --> 00:46:35.005]  And they're literally, you know, gum chewing,
[00:46:35.752 --> 00:46:37.433]  Almost nose-picking adolescents.
[00:46:37.733 --> 00:46:41.494]  I mean, I don't know the shift that's taken place, but it's frightening.
[00:46:42.255 --> 00:46:49.517]  It is frightening, and when I saw them, I thought, oh my God, this is why you jumped the gun and went up to Sacramento and got that search warrant.
[00:46:49.978 --> 00:46:51.838]  They made a very foolish mistake.
[00:46:52.799 --> 00:46:58.401]  Well, they're using all these anti-terror powers just in routine cases that, as you said, aren't even federal.
[00:46:59.125 --> 00:47:01.606]  That's correct, and you have to think about it for just a second.
[00:47:01.646 --> 00:47:08.009]  Let's say these folks are not 28, but they're 30 or 31, and they've spent the last five or six years under this administration.
[00:47:08.349 --> 00:47:17.653]  They've been working under this administration their entire career, for all intents and purposes, since they got out of college or graduate school in their mid-twenties or so.
[00:47:18.013 --> 00:47:19.074]  They know no other way.
[00:47:19.334 --> 00:47:27.157]  And, of course, you couple that with the arrogance, and we were all 28 and 30 at one time or another, the arrogance of your average 28 or 30-year-old with power.
[00:47:28.883 --> 00:47:30.424]  My God, it's a scary thought.
[00:47:31.766 --> 00:47:36.590]  It doesn't take much to realize that you can get to the point where I'm at right now.
[00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:38.231]  Muddled mistakes.
[00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:40.273]  With great power comes great responsibility.
[00:47:40.333 --> 00:47:43.015]  David in California, you're our first caller for our guest.
[00:47:43.035 --> 00:47:43.435]  Go ahead.
[00:47:43.455 --> 00:47:46.398]  I've been waiting to talk to you for a long time.
[00:47:47.496 --> 00:47:56.098]  Sandra Day O'Connor was talking today about those terror things and people being able to search without the warrants and what they have done to you.
[00:47:56.118 --> 00:47:57.339]  And you're very brave.
[00:47:57.739 --> 00:48:02.480]  And I hope your lawyer gets as much publicity as he did when he was with Monica Lewinsky.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.281]  Oh, I'm sure he is.
[00:48:06.341 --> 00:48:08.461]  But you know, Mr. Burton is a very modest man.
[00:48:08.481 --> 00:48:10.742]  Believe it or not, he shies away from the press.
[00:48:11.289 --> 00:48:15.211]  I believe, and that's probably the smarter way to do it, especially right now with the press, what they're doing.
[00:48:15.251 --> 00:48:17.212]  In fact, you see how young these kids are.
[00:48:17.612 --> 00:48:20.854]  They're easily, you can mold them that young.
[00:48:21.154 --> 00:48:25.637]  In fact, if you notice how they're doing the campaign on CNN through YouTube.
[00:48:26.517 --> 00:48:30.739]  I actually watch them talk to these kids and they treat them like little kids that don't know anything.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:37.183]  They're supposed to be a man or a woman by the time you're 18, and people were 100 years ago, but now I meet a lot of 30 year old children.
[00:48:37.945 --> 00:49:06.149]  and uh... it's it's it's it's like a rest of development but uh... you have a question specifically for our guest actually i just got a question as far as uh... how we're going to fix the whole problem uh... we need to just band together i'm going through my neighborhood just in case something does happen and they do try to implement martial law and we're going to get together and we're going to make sure that they can't come and take us away that's important god bless you it's going to be more of an incremental martial law i think fred in philadelphia you're on the air with our guest go ahead the DC madam
[00:49:09.003 --> 00:49:25.884]  I want to talk about the guise of terrorism or the pretext of terrorism to really have financial control and prevent basically any accumulation of capital.
[00:49:26.474 --> 00:49:36.801]  Well, Bush just signed an executive order, and I've talked to top lawyers just over the weekend, and my interpretation was correct, so was Dr. Roberts, that they can start seizing property if you protest the war.
[00:49:37.101 --> 00:49:48.028]  Now, let's see them try that, but the point is... Well, what I meant is that when your guest had the wire transfer, that apparently
[00:49:50.489 --> 00:49:53.910]  It was a motivation to then move into action.
[00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:55.371]  And notice it was warrantless.
[00:49:55.391 --> 00:49:57.692]  They're just looking at everything.
[00:49:58.272 --> 00:49:59.192]  Comments on that, Jean?
[00:50:00.453 --> 00:50:07.795]  Oh yeah, there's no question that the wire transfer was the trigger because for two and a half years, 31 months prior to that, they did absolutely nothing.
[00:50:08.195 --> 00:50:11.736]  And I think when I wired the money, it was the straw that broke the camel's back.
[00:50:11.816 --> 00:50:16.858]  And they sort of panicked and wondered, what was I possibly doing out here in California?
[00:50:17.098 --> 00:50:19.419]  That's when they made the plane reservations and came out here.
[00:50:20.071 --> 00:50:21.552]  So they thought you were getting ready to leave?
[00:50:22.293 --> 00:50:25.956]  I don't know what they thought I was about to do, but they wanted to find out.
[00:50:26.296 --> 00:50:34.903]  I rather suspect that they wanted to get in here and pretend to be a potential buyer, talk to me, chat me up, take a look around, and figure it out for themselves.
[00:50:37.465 --> 00:50:37.905]  Amazing!
[00:50:37.965 --> 00:50:43.890]  Our borders are wide open, the dollar is being devalued, our society is falling apart,
[00:50:45.111 --> 00:50:50.520]  And there are giant teams of feds running around going after escort service owners.
[00:50:51.962 --> 00:50:54.486]  Yeah, that's what's going on in our country.
[00:50:55.247 --> 00:50:55.668]  Stay there.
[00:50:55.708 --> 00:50:56.649]  Thanks for the call, Fred.
[00:50:56.689 --> 00:50:57.871]  More calls for our guests at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:51:04.887 --> 00:51:10.329]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:18.353]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.065 --> 00:51:26.109]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:37.937]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.257 --> 00:51:41.779]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.219 --> 00:51:44.180]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:48.323]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:51:48.903 --> 00:51:55.907]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:52:02.725 --> 00:52:11.790]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:23.277]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:23.617 --> 00:52:28.640]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:28.820]  I think?
[00:52:47.662 --> 00:52:50.785]  Just get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[00:52:51.585 --> 00:52:52.446]  Call New Millennium 888-03-4438.
[00:52:52.526 --> 00:52:53.006]  That's 888-03-4438.
[00:52:53.026 --> 00:52:54.628]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:53:02.455 --> 00:53:04.697]  Oh, those summer nights and those summer electric bills.
[00:53:04.898 --> 00:53:08.201]  How would you like to save money this summer on your electric bill and sleep better than ever?
[00:53:08.441 --> 00:53:11.044]  Well, now you can with the BedFan personal cooling system.
[00:53:11.164 --> 00:53:14.747]  The BedFan will allow you to raise your thermostat several degrees and still sleep cool.
[00:53:15.008 --> 00:53:19.592]  This works by delivering a gentle breeze between your sheets, thus keeping your body cool and comfortable.
[00:53:19.893 --> 00:53:21.214]  Doug from Austin, Texas writes,
[00:53:21.594 --> 00:53:23.335]  I like it to be very cold while sleeping.
[00:53:23.415 --> 00:53:29.397]  Since purchasing the BedFan, I've been able to turn the thermostat up from 68 to 78 degrees, and I've never been more comfortable.
[00:53:29.557 --> 00:53:33.518]  My electric bill this month compared to the same month last year is over 27% lower.
[00:53:33.718 --> 00:53:35.139]  I couldn't be happier with your product.
[00:53:35.379 --> 00:53:38.680]  Maybe it is time you started thinking about trying the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:40.261]  If you're a hot sleeper, you will love it.
[00:53:40.422 --> 00:53:42.584]  If you want to lower your electric bill, you will love it too.
[00:53:42.784 --> 00:53:45.767]  Go to BedFan.com and try the remarkable BedFan yourself.
[00:53:45.907 --> 00:53:47.989]  That's BedFan.com or call 210-632-8280.
[00:53:48.149 --> 00:53:48.410]  That's 210-632-8280.
[00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:51.873]  The BedFan is on sale for a limited time, so don't delay.
[00:53:52.033 --> 00:53:52.834]  Remember, BedFan.com or 210-632-8280.
[00:54:12.486 --> 00:54:12.867]  I think so.
[00:54:42.475 --> 00:54:49.418]  Welcome back.
[00:54:49.718 --> 00:54:53.280]  This world is ruled!
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:55.201]  Alright, Deborah.
[00:55:08.929 --> 00:55:11.571]  Jean Palfrey, our guest, goes by Jean Palfrey.
[00:55:11.611 --> 00:55:12.552]  She's a big D.C.
[00:55:12.572 --> 00:55:12.872]  madam.
[00:55:12.892 --> 00:55:14.854]  Made all these headlines.
[00:55:15.214 --> 00:55:24.342]  And again, this is the feds going after somebody for something that they're in the large portion of the leadership publicly engages in.
[00:55:24.382 --> 00:55:30.647]  I mean, Barney Frank, ladies and gentlemen, in the late 90s was caught in Maryland running underage male prostitutes.
[00:55:31.107 --> 00:55:32.748]  We're talking hardcore felonies.
[00:55:33.169 --> 00:55:34.430]  Stuff he should be in trouble for.
[00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:38.093]  Out of his three-story townhouse.
[00:55:39.213 --> 00:55:41.814]  Now, now, that is serious business.
[00:55:41.894 --> 00:55:48.297]  But, oh, he came out at a press conference, he said, if this doesn't drop right now, the government's going down.
[00:55:48.497 --> 00:55:54.059]  And they went, oh, because, you know, we all know about the true leadership, what they're really into.
[00:55:54.539 --> 00:56:00.741]  In fact, this list that Palfrey has would be the who's who if she ran a mail brothel.
[00:56:01.081 --> 00:56:01.622]  But it's not.
[00:56:02.822 --> 00:56:07.704]  So it's, I guess, more the functionaries that were, and some senators that were involved in this.
[00:56:08.808 --> 00:56:11.610]  But it's just off the charts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:13.171]  Now, we have a call that disagrees.
[00:56:13.191 --> 00:56:16.613]  I have a rule, people that disagree go to the head of the line as long as they're nice.
[00:56:16.633 --> 00:56:21.255]  But before we go to Jeff, Mike, DJ, and many others that are holding, our guest will be with us 20 minutes to the next hour.
[00:56:21.275 --> 00:56:35.283]  Gene, we were talking during the break and you were saying that finally you're starting to get in contact with media that doesn't censor you and you're finally now able to talk about what's really going on here and not just the watch list of who's going to be outed next.
[00:56:36.212 --> 00:56:36.632]  That's true.
[00:56:36.712 --> 00:56:42.194]  Finally, the tide is turning that people are starting to ask, why is this happening?
[00:56:42.234 --> 00:56:43.214]  What's going on here?
[00:56:43.314 --> 00:56:45.334]  Why is it this woman and this woman alone?
[00:56:45.835 --> 00:56:46.755]  Why no one else?
[00:56:47.215 --> 00:57:02.639]  Do you know that my federal public defender, who was my criminal attorney before I was appointed, Mr. Preston Burton, told me that in his 16 years, and he is the chief federal public defender for the District of Columbia, 16 years in Washington at that office,
[00:57:03.092 --> 00:57:06.755]  He has never seen a case like mine, nor have any of his colleagues.
[00:57:07.855 --> 00:57:09.256]  There's something going on here.
[00:57:09.397 --> 00:57:10.737]  Well, let me just ask you in your gut.
[00:57:11.178 --> 00:57:18.263]  My gut, and by my gut, the history I've studied, and you can never be sure, tells me there's some type of black op going on here.
[00:57:18.743 --> 00:57:20.945]  You were saying your lawyers and others do believe that as well?
[00:57:21.725 --> 00:57:23.867]  Or do you think, I mean, what's the chance?
[00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:27.109]  Fifty-fifty, it's a black op versus young idiots?
[00:57:27.609 --> 00:57:31.312]  Or did the young idiots do this and then trigger a black op?
[00:57:31.332 --> 00:57:32.513]  What do you think's going on?
[00:57:33.333 --> 00:57:35.434]  I think there was something going on.
[00:57:35.574 --> 00:57:39.656]  There was a very good reason why I was being watched and not touched for quite a while.
[00:57:40.216 --> 00:57:41.196]  I think they panicked.
[00:57:41.296 --> 00:57:43.437]  They came out here to find out what was going on.
[00:57:43.537 --> 00:57:46.379]  I don't think that they expected to do what they did.
[00:57:46.399 --> 00:57:53.221]  Then we had the stupidity of these young kids come in and they triggered this entire mess.
[00:57:53.401 --> 00:57:56.183]  I think there is something serious at the core of all of this.
[00:57:56.723 --> 00:57:59.564]  What that is, I don't know at this point in time, but something happened
[00:57:59.989 --> 00:58:02.898]  And something was going on behind my back with this agency.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:07.633]  And when I made all these aberrant moves, selling my house, closing the business, wiring the money...
[00:58:08.089 --> 00:58:12.910]  That's when they panicked a little and came out here to find out what was going on.
[00:58:13.331 --> 00:58:15.511]  So, something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
[00:58:15.791 --> 00:58:16.311]  Oh, you bet.
[00:58:16.792 --> 00:58:18.312]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:18.372 --> 00:58:20.993]  I'm going to go directly to Jeff in Canada, who disagrees with something.
[00:58:21.373 --> 00:58:31.796]  You go to the head of the line, then Mike in Rhode Island, DJ in Illinois, and many, many others, 1-800-259-9231, specifically on this subject.
[00:58:32.676 --> 00:58:36.838]  And it's a wide subject, and a very important subject, as we turn over the rocks.
[00:58:37.158 --> 00:58:37.618]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:46.184]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.224 --> 00:58:46.484]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.304 --> 00:59:00.345]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.065 --> 00:59:02.186]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.827 --> 00:59:03.647]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.408 --> 00:59:05.329]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.969 --> 00:59:09.632]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.152 --> 00:59:14.295]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.741 --> 00:59:24.422]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:24.482 --> 00:59:26.224]  Now into the third and final hour.
[00:59:27.382 --> 00:59:30.543]  Our guest will be leaving us in about 20 minutes, and I'm going to continue with calls.
[00:59:30.563 --> 00:59:32.324]  I'm going to get more into the international news.
[00:59:32.704 --> 00:59:34.304]  Some economic news is taking place.
[00:59:34.364 --> 00:59:45.448]  These daily, sometimes three or four times daily, announcements on different fronts of the presidency being supposedly above the law, it's never before been seen.
[00:59:45.808 --> 00:59:48.569]  Even during the Civil War, the president didn't say it was above the law.
[00:59:50.329 --> 00:59:52.690]  So we are definitely in the twilight zone here.
[00:59:53.765 --> 00:59:54.966]  Gene Palfrey, the D.C.
[00:59:55.046 --> 00:59:57.227]  Madam, one of the biggest stories of the last 10 months.
[00:59:57.608 --> 00:59:58.108]  He's our guest.
[00:59:58.128 --> 00:59:59.089]  We're honored to have her.
[00:59:59.829 --> 01:00:03.991]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in Canada, who I'm told disagrees with something.
[01:00:04.031 --> 01:00:04.552]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:00:05.052 --> 01:00:05.813]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:00:05.893 --> 01:00:06.593]  Good afternoon, Gene.
[01:00:07.333 --> 01:00:07.894]  Good afternoon.
[01:00:09.215 --> 01:00:10.435]  I have two points.
[01:00:10.475 --> 01:00:11.356]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:17.079]  The first point is, the world's going to hell in a handbasket, as we all know, and we're talking about prostitution in politics.
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:21.742]  These are the oldest institutions in the world.
[01:00:23.714 --> 01:00:24.694]  Hold on, let me stop you.
[01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:26.455]  We haven't made it clear here.
[01:00:26.515 --> 01:00:27.835]  That's the whole point of this.
[01:00:28.215 --> 01:00:29.996]  They have violated her constitutional rights.
[01:00:30.216 --> 01:00:31.536]  They've grabbed her assets.
[01:00:32.016 --> 01:00:34.177]  They've done it through anti-terror auspices.
[01:00:34.477 --> 01:00:37.797]  This can affect anybody, whether you're running a car dealership or a restaurant.
[01:00:38.498 --> 01:00:40.078]  This stuff's going on everywhere.
[01:00:40.558 --> 01:00:44.319]  And that's the whole point, is they're a pack of hypocrites.
[01:00:45.979 --> 01:00:51.701]  This is a story, just like we do every day here, about what's happening to individuals.
[01:00:51.741 --> 01:00:52.201]  Keep going.
[01:00:52.776 --> 01:00:53.796]  Let me finish my point, please.
[01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:54.496]  Thank you very much.
[01:00:55.537 --> 01:01:00.118]  I totally disagree with you and your call that the mob shakes down businesses all the time, as do the police.
[01:01:00.178 --> 01:01:01.078]  This is no different.
[01:01:01.678 --> 01:01:02.818]  I think that Ms.
[01:01:02.858 --> 01:01:05.879]  Palfrey needs to go back to Thomas Jefferson and finish her law degree.
[01:01:06.159 --> 01:01:10.780]  I'm disturbed that you would openly recruit female students from local universities for your business.
[01:01:11.621 --> 01:01:13.341]  And you've had prior legal problems, Ms.
[01:01:13.361 --> 01:01:17.862]  Palfrey, including a restraining order from her former boyfriend in 1989 and a 1990 arrest for prostitution.
[01:01:21.832 --> 01:01:34.582]  When you're involved in these types of businesses, this is the type of activity that mobsters and gangsters in the government will be attracted to, and they will try to shake you down, obviously, and this is what's obviously going on.
[01:01:34.982 --> 01:01:37.024]  I don't think this should surprise anybody.
[01:01:37.664 --> 01:01:39.205]  Well, let me talk.
[01:01:39.245 --> 01:01:42.947]  We're not saying that this surprises anybody.
[01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:56.415]  We're here because it's a big national case, and the government is being hypocritical, and so the attitude of just accepting that gangsters run the society, and so that somehow we're wrong to be talking about this, you know, really shows a nihilistic view.
[01:01:56.695 --> 01:01:58.757]  Now, you sound like an articulate person.
[01:01:58.817 --> 01:02:00.698]  Boil down what your particular
[01:02:01.178 --> 01:02:09.542]  Well, there's nothing like that at all, but I appreciate the attempt to try and misalign... The fact of the matter remains that your guest has spent a number of years trying to complete a law degree.
[01:02:10.122 --> 01:02:11.983]  I would suggest that she go and complete that degree.
[01:02:30.431 --> 01:02:36.194]  on somebody implying and trying to impeach her, claiming that she is a wash-up or somehow a failure.
[01:02:36.214 --> 01:02:36.434]  Not at all.
[01:02:36.454 --> 01:02:36.734]  Not at all.
[01:02:36.774 --> 01:02:37.354]  Not at all.

[01:02:57.804 --> 01:02:58.244]  Not at all.
[01:02:58.829 --> 01:02:59.950]  I didn't call you a wash up.
[01:03:00.070 --> 01:03:01.430]  I didn't call you a wash up.
[01:03:01.631 --> 01:03:04.332]  Put him on hold.
[01:03:04.372 --> 01:03:05.012]  Put him on hold.
[01:03:05.212 --> 01:03:13.097]  He condescendingly, like the snake in the jungle book, went, I suggest you continue.
[01:03:13.437 --> 01:03:14.918]  I suggest you try.
[01:03:15.138 --> 01:03:18.980]  I mean, don't cast those stones and claim you didn't throw them.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:19.280]  Go ahead.
[01:03:19.853 --> 01:03:27.258]  Well, also, regarding the age of the women that I hired, I hired women ages 23 to 25 years of age and up.
[01:03:27.338 --> 01:03:31.621]  I did not solicit young girls specifically for the very reason he's implying.
[01:03:31.961 --> 01:03:36.704]  And most of the women actually were in their mid to late 20s, 30s, and some even into their 40s.
[01:03:36.804 --> 01:03:40.626]  I'm gonna give Snake Man the final word on the other side on this and then take more calls.
[01:03:40.666 --> 01:03:42.628]  Gene, stay with us.
[01:03:42.668 --> 01:03:43.448]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:44.008 --> 01:03:46.650]  Baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you.
[01:03:56.790 --> 01:04:02.256]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.617 --> 01:04:10.265]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.962 --> 01:04:18.006]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.406 --> 01:04:29.872]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.152 --> 01:04:33.634]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.115 --> 01:04:36.036]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.376 --> 01:04:40.218]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:56.569 --> 01:04:59.351]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.632 --> 01:05:03.774]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.215 --> 01:05:05.035]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.356 --> 01:05:09.919]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.399 --> 01:05:12.521]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:13.022 --> 01:05:13.923]  Sheltering in Place.
[01:05:14.303 --> 01:05:18.047]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[01:05:18.347 --> 01:05:27.716]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:27.756 --> 01:05:28.156]  government.
[01:05:28.397 --> 01:05:34.823]  Gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:35.163 --> 01:05:39.548]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:05:40.009 --> 01:05:41.791]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.811 --> 01:05:42.031]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:42.111 --> 01:05:43.593]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:05:53.328 --> 01:05:57.411]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[01:05:57.671 --> 01:06:02.754]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[01:06:03.054 --> 01:06:07.697]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[01:06:08.037 --> 01:06:09.998]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:16.162]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[01:06:16.522 --> 01:06:17.303]  And it works!
[01:06:17.723 --> 01:06:19.184]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[01:06:19.564 --> 01:06:20.565]  Now it's your turn.
[01:06:20.845 --> 01:06:23.187]  Today you can get a full bottle of Tautenol.
[01:06:23.347 --> 01:06:27.630]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:31.033]  See what Tautenol can do for you and your confidence.
[01:06:31.393 --> 01:06:33.615]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[01:06:33.795 --> 01:06:36.156]  For your risk-free bottle of Tautenol, call 1-800-894-5152.
[01:06:36.196 --> 01:06:36.477]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[01:06:36.497 --> 01:06:39.098]  Tautenol is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[01:06:45.643 --> 01:06:46.303]  Guaranteed.
[01:06:46.523 --> 01:06:49.284]  Call 1-800-894-5152.
[01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:51.105]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[01:06:51.265 --> 01:07:01.009]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.609 --> 01:07:04.650]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:08.712]  We're talking with Gene Palfrey.
[01:07:11.233 --> 01:07:12.553]  And we're taking your calls right now.
[01:07:12.573 --> 01:07:14.214]  We're about to go to Mike and
[01:07:15.046 --> 01:07:16.808]  DJ Rodney Clayton and others.
[01:07:16.828 --> 01:07:19.612]  We've only got about 15 more minutes here or less.
[01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:24.693]  Will Fest, Jeff in Canada, finish up your operation there.
[01:07:24.993 --> 01:07:25.294]  Thanks, Al.
[01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:31.218]  Name calling won't dissuade me or distract me from my point, referring to me as Snake Man as you went out to the break there.
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:36.761]  Dirty politicians and prostitutes need to get right with God.
[01:07:36.781 --> 01:07:38.303]  Your moral compass is all over the place.
[01:07:38.543 --> 01:07:48.830]  Second point, Alex, don't tell your callers to buy food, because the first thing the spooks do is they go to the database where all these people buy food, and they determine where people have stored food,
[01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:57.453]  And the first thing when they declare martial law, they go out to these houses that have weapons and caches of food, and they seize them, and they make public examples of these people.
[01:07:57.754 --> 01:07:58.214]  That's it.
[01:07:58.654 --> 01:08:00.315]  And by the way, you have a great show.
[01:08:00.335 --> 01:08:01.195]  I have enjoyed your show.
[01:08:01.215 --> 01:08:02.496]  You woke me up to the New World Order.
[01:08:02.536 --> 01:08:04.476]  I just think this is a major distraction.
[01:08:04.696 --> 01:08:05.857]  And that's it, Alex.
[01:08:05.977 --> 01:08:08.298]  Listen, I appreciate, sir, I appreciate your call.
[01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:10.179]  You know, that's ridiculous.
[01:08:11.639 --> 01:08:18.142]  I told my listeners, and we're going to run back to Gene in a minute, I told my listeners five, six, seven years ago to do what I do.
[01:08:18.909 --> 01:08:23.251]  Whatever I say to people that I think they should do is what I believe they should do.
[01:08:23.872 --> 01:08:25.873]  Get a small piece of property out in the country.
[01:08:26.253 --> 01:08:27.434]  I don't care if it's in the desert.
[01:08:28.034 --> 01:08:28.954]  As insurance.
[01:08:28.994 --> 01:08:30.475]  And I also have regular insurance, too.
[01:08:31.436 --> 01:08:32.576]  Have some storable food.
[01:08:33.037 --> 01:08:34.137]  Have some firearms.
[01:08:34.397 --> 01:08:35.218]  Know how to use them.
[01:08:35.258 --> 01:08:37.539]  I tell women, go out and take a gun course.
[01:08:37.979 --> 01:08:39.200]  Protect yourself from predators.
[01:08:40.429 --> 01:08:43.030]  I tell people to buy gold at $300 an ounce.
[01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.770]  It's gone over $700.
[01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:45.491]  It's at six something right now.
[01:08:45.771 --> 01:08:48.191]  And the dollar's been devalued by 57% since then.
[01:08:48.511 --> 01:08:51.192]  I mean, the stuff I come up with is no brainer.
[01:08:51.792 --> 01:08:52.032]  Okay?
[01:08:52.052 --> 01:08:55.013]  And if you start giving in to don't own guns, you'll be in a database.
[01:08:55.133 --> 01:08:57.474]  Or don't have storable foods, they'll come get it from you.
[01:08:57.894 --> 01:09:00.655]  No, the government doesn't have the power to go get everybody's guns and food.
[01:09:01.055 --> 01:09:05.076]  They shut off the food and water, like New Orleans, and they make you come in for help.
[01:09:05.695 --> 01:09:06.135]  Okay.
[01:09:06.776 --> 01:09:11.159]  So, I mean, that is totally wrong in your philosophy there too, sir.
[01:09:11.179 --> 01:09:13.601]  Jean, do you want to comment on anything he was saying?
[01:09:15.343 --> 01:09:34.678]  Well, you know, I see these kinds of comments on the Internet from time to time, and I tend to believe you didn't hit the nail on the head when you said that this really has more to do with him and his, perhaps, insecurities about whatever in life, women, whatever, than it has to do with me and my particular situation.
[01:09:35.441 --> 01:09:40.848]  Many of the things he said have been greatly skewed and greatly taken out of proportion.
[01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:52.804]  The example here about the women in the Diamondback newspaper, that is a University of Maryland college newspaper, and I, for a very short period of time, advertised for graduate-level age and above.
[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:55.241]  Which is 22, 23 and above.
[01:09:55.581 --> 01:10:12.730]  Well look, regardless, we're having a discussion here about the police state and about hypocrisy, and you know, I'm a Christian, and I'm tired of people that get so pious and so worshipful of themselves that they won't even talk to tax collectors or prostitutes, but that's all that Jesus hung around with.
[01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:15.032]  So, I mean, I've just had enough of it.
[01:10:15.133 --> 01:10:16.915]  Enough of the holier-than-thou.
[01:10:18.036 --> 01:10:19.077]  All of us have got problems.
[01:10:19.438 --> 01:10:20.319]  None of us are perfect.
[01:10:20.539 --> 01:10:22.281]  The point is we're talking about hypocrisy here.
[01:10:22.701 --> 01:10:23.262]  That's correct.
[01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:23.682]  That's correct.
[01:10:23.703 --> 01:10:29.069]  There's not one of us who can't have their life if examined under a microscope just ripped apart.
[01:10:30.184 --> 01:10:31.184]  In one fashion or another.
[01:10:31.404 --> 01:10:31.824]  Exactly.
[01:10:31.844 --> 01:10:33.125]  That's why I'm not here judging.
[01:10:33.145 --> 01:10:36.846]  In fact, I mean, I don't think people should go to jail for using drugs.
[01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:38.246]  Not that I think drugs are good.
[01:10:38.286 --> 01:10:39.246]  I say don't use them.
[01:10:39.266 --> 01:10:39.786]  They're bad.
[01:10:40.186 --> 01:10:42.547]  But, I mean, then Limbaugh says send everybody to prison.
[01:10:42.587 --> 01:10:43.367]  He uses drugs.
[01:10:43.427 --> 01:10:44.768]  It turns out he's on drugs.
[01:10:44.788 --> 01:10:45.628]  He doesn't go to prison.
[01:10:45.948 --> 01:10:48.909]  You know, I mean, I want people to live by the standards they put out.
[01:10:49.349 --> 01:10:50.469]  That's the whole point here.
[01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:53.610]  Let's go to Mike in Rhode Island.
[01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:54.210]  You're on the air.
[01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:54.590]  Go ahead.
[01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:55.970]  Hey, Alex.
[01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:56.970]  How are we doing today?
[01:10:57.090 --> 01:10:57.210]  Good.
[01:10:57.230 --> 01:10:59.211]  I've been hoping to hear from you in a while, buddy.
[01:11:01.552 --> 01:11:03.773]  Does this go to the Grove, you figure?
[01:11:05.494 --> 01:11:09.937]  Well, I mean, we know they bring male prostitutes in there.
[01:11:09.977 --> 01:11:11.859]  It's going on right now in Northern California, but no.
[01:11:12.779 --> 01:11:14.500]  Have you ever heard of the Bohemian Grove?
[01:11:16.001 --> 01:11:16.262]  Me?
[01:11:16.362 --> 01:11:16.562]  No.
[01:11:16.642 --> 01:11:18.063]  No, I have not.
[01:11:18.283 --> 01:11:18.803]  No, I have not.
[01:11:19.044 --> 01:11:20.505]  That's north of San Francisco.
[01:11:20.585 --> 01:11:24.407]  It's an elite retreat where the mainly Republican leadership goes to frolic.
[01:11:25.168 --> 01:11:26.669]  Well, maybe that's why I haven't heard of it.
[01:11:27.569 --> 01:11:28.290]  Mike, anything else?
[01:11:29.185 --> 01:11:31.088]  Uh, yeah, just, uh, one more thing.
[01:11:31.108 --> 01:11:32.851]  It's a little different subject.
[01:11:33.452 --> 01:11:36.757]  Uh, did you see the, uh, alert that Hal Turner put out?
[01:11:38.219 --> 01:11:38.720]  No, I didn't.
[01:11:39.661 --> 01:11:43.267]  Uh, basically, somebody gave a document that they say came from the military.
[01:11:43.803 --> 01:11:47.905]  Talks about preparing for an insurgency in this country.
[01:11:48.646 --> 01:11:50.126]  Well, sir, that's admitted.
[01:11:50.166 --> 01:11:54.509]  I mean, we have a big article up on PrisonPlanet.com about that right now.
[01:11:54.529 --> 01:11:57.210]  I mean, that was in PDD 51.
[01:11:57.250 --> 01:11:59.411]  That was in John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[01:11:59.472 --> 01:12:02.753]  I mean, that's coming up later in the show.
[01:12:02.793 --> 01:12:04.514]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:12:05.095 --> 01:12:08.416]  Let's talk to DJ in Illinois.
[01:12:08.436 --> 01:12:09.297]  You're on the air, DJ.
[01:12:10.197 --> 01:12:10.517]  Okay.
[01:12:10.658 --> 01:12:13.159]  Number one, I come pretty much from the same
[01:12:14.162 --> 01:12:16.204]  Point of view that you are, Alex.
[01:12:17.165 --> 01:12:37.081]  I don't have anything good to say about prostitution and many other things, but something comes to mind about someone named Hitler going after those classified as undesirables to set precedent.
[01:12:38.702 --> 01:12:42.866]  And a court precedent completely obliterating
[01:12:43.567 --> 01:12:54.774]  Due process, where the average person would say, well I'm not going to do anything about it, is one of the things that comes to mind.
[01:12:55.174 --> 01:12:59.697]  Yeah, they're using anti-terror provisions on her when she has nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:13:00.837 --> 01:13:08.722]  And I'm also wondering if originally they were either looking for somebody amongst clans or whatever,
[01:13:09.642 --> 01:13:10.984]  Do you think
[01:13:27.262 --> 01:13:31.044]  And in such a big business, they even have PIs doing it and giving the data to the agencies.
[01:13:31.304 --> 01:13:34.727]  Defense Intelligence, CIA, and 50 others you haven't heard of, folks.
[01:13:35.207 --> 01:13:40.351]  And they shadow, you know, these normal operations and then are collecting the data there.
[01:13:40.391 --> 01:13:42.493]  That's just basic blackmail intelligence.
[01:13:43.093 --> 01:13:45.795]  Yes, a couple of things that popped in my head.
[01:13:46.656 --> 01:13:48.177]  And I don't think... This is kind of...
[01:13:49.363 --> 01:13:51.083]  You know, all you have to do is think.
[01:13:51.424 --> 01:13:54.204]  By the way, Jean, pop in any time with comments, but go ahead.
[01:13:54.224 --> 01:13:58.185]  Oh, no, I think the points that are being made are absolutely correct.
[01:13:58.546 --> 01:14:00.866]  Well, a couple other ones that have popped into my head.
[01:14:00.906 --> 01:14:03.547]  This idea of dragging all of this out.
[01:14:06.268 --> 01:14:10.849]  These people are not only power-mad, they are insane.
[01:14:11.249 --> 01:14:12.269]  They're paranoid.
[01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:14.430]  They're schizophrenic.
[01:14:18.057 --> 01:14:19.698]  I got to jump, I appreciate your call.
[01:14:19.778 --> 01:14:22.440]  Rodney in Texas, you're on the air with our guest, go ahead.
[01:14:23.481 --> 01:14:34.649]  Yeah, Saturday I was reading in the Washington Post that one of the young ladies that was involved, one of the professional ladies of leisure there, Ms.
[01:14:34.710 --> 01:14:34.990]  Jean,
[01:14:35.802 --> 01:14:37.764]  That she turned up dead.
[01:14:37.844 --> 01:14:52.795]  They claim that she committed suicide, but based on what I heard Jean say about the profile that she used to recruit her girls, these ladies are very, very stable, very strong-minded individuals.
[01:14:52.835 --> 01:15:00.181]  So I just don't believe that this young lady named Brandy Britton committed suicide.
[01:15:00.241 --> 01:15:01.482]  And I agree with you, Alex.
[01:15:01.582 --> 01:15:03.944]  It sounds to me like this was a
[01:15:04.895 --> 01:15:07.936]  A black operation that turned sour.
[01:15:08.076 --> 01:15:12.576]  Well, remember right before 9-11 how they found the young aides' bones in the woods?
[01:15:13.517 --> 01:15:16.477]  Yeah, but I'd like to hear what Jean has to say about this, girl.
[01:15:16.497 --> 01:15:18.458]  I don't believe she committed suicide.
[01:15:18.578 --> 01:15:22.498]  What else can you tell us about her situation?
[01:15:22.538 --> 01:15:26.539]  Because they're saying she committed suicide, but I don't believe that.
[01:15:27.339 --> 01:15:28.479]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:15:28.499 --> 01:15:31.820]  There's a lot of speculation whether or not it was suicide or homicide.
[01:15:32.267 --> 01:15:40.195]  Brandy worked for me a few years back when she committed suicide or was murdered, whatever the case may be.
[01:15:40.595 --> 01:15:44.319]  She was not in my employ and had not been for a year or so.
[01:15:44.339 --> 01:15:46.521]  So would you say she was stable?
[01:15:48.123 --> 01:15:49.905]  Yeah, I do remember her.
[01:15:50.605 --> 01:15:51.947]  She was a college professor.
[01:15:51.967 --> 01:15:52.848]  She had a Ph.D.
[01:15:52.888 --> 01:15:53.748]  in sociology.
[01:15:53.788 --> 01:15:55.190]  Yes, of course she was stable.
[01:15:55.658 --> 01:15:57.519]  Yeah, she was in her early 40s.
[01:15:57.559 --> 01:15:58.340]  She was a mother.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:03.303]  She had a couple of minor children, perhaps teenage, junior high, high school age.
[01:16:04.123 --> 01:16:05.064]  They came after her.
[01:16:05.144 --> 01:16:07.926]  They destroyed her life on a simple prostitution bust.
[01:16:08.366 --> 01:16:09.467]  This was a state charge.
[01:16:09.487 --> 01:16:10.868]  This was not a federal charge.
[01:16:11.588 --> 01:16:13.169]  And they humiliated her.
[01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:14.950]  They just ruined her life.
[01:16:15.451 --> 01:16:20.274]  And frankly, it was just, I think, more than she could take, if indeed she did commit suicide.
[01:16:20.314 --> 01:16:22.135]  Now, there are many, many family members
[01:16:22.671 --> 01:16:29.281]  Of course saying that this is not the case, that she was too strong a person, that she was a fighter and that she would never have committed suicide.
[01:16:29.301 --> 01:16:31.384]  So that is very much up in the air.
[01:16:32.293 --> 01:16:44.180]  And I just want to say this, finally, I'm glad that you're exposing these two-faced people in Washington, D.C., like David Vitter and Randall Tobias, and probably the list goes on and on.
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:52.065]  And I just hope that you don't let these people pay you off and go ahead and expose them for what they really are.
[01:16:52.505 --> 01:16:53.926]  And thank you for your time, Ms.
[01:16:53.946 --> 01:16:55.927]  Jean, and you too, Alex.
[01:16:56.047 --> 01:16:56.667]  You bet, Rodney.
[01:16:56.687 --> 01:16:57.248]  Good to hear from you.
[01:16:57.288 --> 01:17:00.550]  Well, look, I mean, she's already dropped the atomic bomb on him.
[01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:02.411]  She's already released the numbers.
[01:17:03.892 --> 01:17:04.773]  Yeah, yeah, I have.
[01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:13.078]  And not to be concerned, I have no intention of letting anyone buy me off or make any kind of a deal with me.
[01:17:13.419 --> 01:17:15.040]  And you're not planning to commit suicide?
[01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:17.181]  And I'm not planning to commit suicide either.
[01:17:18.362 --> 01:17:20.624]  Well, it's definitely crazy times right now.
[01:17:21.064 --> 01:17:24.146]  Clayton in Texas, last call that we have time for with our guest.
[01:17:24.887 --> 01:17:26.609]  Alex, thank you so much for the job that you do.
[01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:32.655]  I just want to say, Gene, man, my heart goes out to you.
[01:17:32.675 --> 01:17:36.900]  Moral arguments set aside, you have a right to due process.
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:37.821]  All of us do.
[01:17:37.841 --> 01:17:39.723]  You have a right to know what you're being charged for.
[01:17:40.063 --> 01:17:41.865]  You have a right for evidence to be presented.
[01:17:42.205 --> 01:17:46.270]  You have a right to not have your assets freeze so you can defend yourself.
[01:17:47.210 --> 01:17:48.251]  I run my own business.
[01:17:49.192 --> 01:17:50.393]  I pay my taxes.
[01:17:50.473 --> 01:17:51.034]  I've got 940, 941's.
[01:17:51.334 --> 01:17:53.536]  I've got stuff out the wazoo.
[01:17:53.576 --> 01:17:55.057]  I can't even hardly keep up with it all.
[01:17:55.638 --> 01:17:57.860]  And I do everything that I can to do the right thing.
[01:17:57.900 --> 01:17:59.461]  But I know when I go to my P.O.
[01:17:59.521 --> 01:18:02.724]  Box, I just wonder when I'm going to get the letter that I missed something.
[01:18:03.144 --> 01:18:05.826]  And they're going to come take everything I've worked my whole life.
[01:18:05.846 --> 01:18:07.047]  They're the mafia.
[01:18:07.107 --> 01:18:07.968]  It's insane.
[01:18:08.068 --> 01:18:13.552]  It is out of control and we need to start standing up for our rights and for our Constitution.
[01:18:13.852 --> 01:18:14.312]  I agree.
[01:18:14.412 --> 01:18:15.593]  Clayton, we're out of time.
[01:18:16.614 --> 01:18:18.415]  I want to get you back up as this develops.
[01:18:18.495 --> 01:18:21.017]  Thank you, Jean Palfrey, for spending time with us.
[01:18:21.037 --> 01:18:23.659]  There's a link to your website with more details and the phone numbers.
[01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:27.162]  Everybody can help investigate on this, on your website.
[01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:30.504]  So again, thank you so much for your courage and coming on the show.
[01:18:32.382 --> 01:18:34.804]  Should we be looking for any big news to be breaking in the next few weeks?
[01:18:35.624 --> 01:18:36.945]  There's a distinct possibility.
[01:18:37.565 --> 01:18:38.966]  There's a distinct possibility.
[01:18:40.207 --> 01:18:42.168]  We'll just have to see how it rolls out.
[01:18:42.528 --> 01:18:42.808]  All right.
[01:18:42.848 --> 01:18:44.529]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:18:44.569 --> 01:18:45.570]  Well, thank you very much.
[01:18:46.230 --> 01:18:47.571]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:47.591 --> 01:18:47.951]  Stay with me.
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:00.264]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:19:00.604 --> 01:19:04.688]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:19:04.988 --> 01:19:05.529]  We listened.
[01:19:05.849 --> 01:19:10.833]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:19:11.094 --> 01:19:11.594]  We listened.
[01:19:11.974 --> 01:19:14.997]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:19:15.437 --> 01:19:15.958]  We listened.
[01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:20.480]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:21.340]  We listened.
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:26.923]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:19:27.343 --> 01:19:28.704]  Again, we listened.
[01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:30.644]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[01:19:30.824 --> 01:19:36.387]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:19:36.847 --> 01:19:39.489]  Get the Berkey Light at the American Water Purifier.
[01:19:39.689 --> 01:19:39.890]  Only $279.
[01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:40.530]  Call New Millennium 888-03-4438.
[01:19:40.570 --> 01:19:40.810]  That's 888-03-4438.

[01:19:42.512 --> 01:19:43.472]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:53.186 --> 01:19:57.087]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:19:57.307 --> 01:20:09.590]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:10.410]  The U.S.
[01:20:10.450 --> 01:20:16.032]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:20:16.432 --> 01:20:18.633]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:20:20.513 --> 01:20:21.554]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:20:21.594 --> 01:20:24.455]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:20:24.555 --> 01:20:30.577]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:20:31.017 --> 01:20:34.358]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:20:34.438 --> 01:20:40.781]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:20:41.341 --> 01:20:46.265]  You must understand how recession and oppression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:48.046]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:48.426 --> 01:20:51.088]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:55.051]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:20:55.191 --> 01:20:56.452]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:20:56.692 --> 01:20:59.534]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:20:59.875 --> 01:21:02.637]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:21:03.177 --> 01:21:09.902]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:21:52.392 --> 01:21:55.113]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[01:21:55.553 --> 01:21:57.834]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[01:21:58.134 --> 01:22:01.215]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[01:22:01.715 --> 01:22:03.855]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[01:22:04.015 --> 01:22:05.416]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[01:22:05.676 --> 01:22:09.777]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[01:22:10.117 --> 01:22:13.238]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[01:22:13.518 --> 01:22:14.759]  With more than 500 vital functions.
[01:22:15.999 --> 01:22:24.266]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with Live52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.

[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.223]  That's research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:23:02.205 --> 01:23:06.328]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[01:23:08.037 --> 01:23:09.779]  So long, Texas!
[01:23:32.066 --> 01:23:33.647]  You get your guts kicked in.
[01:23:34.108 --> 01:23:40.513]  You know, that's the incredible thing about Mexico.
[01:23:40.533 --> 01:23:41.914]  100 million and growing.
[01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:44.877]  30% of their population living here.
[01:23:59.662 --> 01:24:00.883]  Highly nationalistic.
[01:24:00.923 --> 01:24:01.423]  Don't blame them.
[01:24:01.463 --> 01:24:01.883]  That's fine.
[01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:03.704]  That's normal.
[01:24:03.724 --> 01:24:04.524]  That's what you should be.
[01:24:05.685 --> 01:24:12.308]  And if you go down there, when you're not supposed to be there, they will beat the daylights out of you, suck any money out of you, steal your car.
[01:24:12.348 --> 01:24:13.488]  The government will, publicly.
[01:24:14.869 --> 01:24:18.810]  Call your family up and demand money out of you, and then you'll be lucky if you ever get out of there alive.
[01:24:20.151 --> 01:24:26.814]  And if you come into Mexico out of Guatemala, they put you in a concentration camp for at least six months to work off the cost of arresting you.
[01:24:29.244 --> 01:24:32.845]  And you do anything wrong in Mexico, they will hang you out to dry.
[01:24:34.865 --> 01:24:45.368]  But then there's all this whining, and the cops in major cities don't give them DWIs or arrest them, but the citizens, because again, we're the dumb idiots.
[01:24:46.108 --> 01:24:49.089]  The government looks at us and goes, look, there's the morons.
[01:24:49.629 --> 01:24:52.349]  There's the people that think they're free and giggle and snicker to themselves.
[01:24:52.649 --> 01:24:53.250]  Well, not me.
[01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:55.230]  I want my real freedom, and I'm going to get it.
[01:24:55.774 --> 01:24:58.779]  And I'm not going to be living under martial law, and I'm not going along with this baloney.
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.843]  At least I'm not going to go down without a fight, I know that.
[01:25:03.507 --> 01:25:08.756]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, you know, we had a couple calls saying basically she was an evil demon because she ran an escort service.
[01:25:12.230 --> 01:25:26.101]  Yes, that's not really a good thing, folks, but my point is that it's hypocritical for the government leadership to be involved in stuff far worse than enforcing against this lady, and then violating her due process and Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:25:26.622 --> 01:25:26.962]  That's it!
[01:25:27.683 --> 01:25:28.924]  It's a real simple equation.
[01:25:30.024 --> 01:25:40.192]  I mean, we get up here, I mean, you know, I remember interviewing Christopher Boleyn when he worked for American Free Press many times.
[01:25:41.542 --> 01:25:48.905]  Until I, I don't know, under pressure or whatever, he just got on with some weird people and just horrible things were written about me and other things.
[01:25:49.305 --> 01:25:49.745]  I don't care.
[01:25:49.765 --> 01:25:51.186]  I mean, really, I don't.
[01:25:51.266 --> 01:25:53.087]  I just send people to listen to the show.
[01:25:53.327 --> 01:25:55.648]  That's what the people that attack me in the government and others don't realize.
[01:25:55.668 --> 01:25:56.648]  Because I love it.
[01:25:57.428 --> 01:25:58.969]  When you're over the target, you get flack.
[01:25:58.989 --> 01:26:00.850]  I mean, if they're not attacking you, you're not doing your job.
[01:26:02.050 --> 01:26:08.072]  But even when the cops did violate his rights up in Illinois, up in Chicago, I mean, they did.
[01:26:08.092 --> 01:26:09.513]  It was in their own report.
[01:26:10.535 --> 01:26:18.898]  Frankly, I didn't believe a word he was saying by that point until I read their own report, and I was like, they say they tackled him in his own front yard, and they call that assaulting them.
[01:26:19.959 --> 01:26:21.219]  I went on there and I said it was wrong.
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:29.842]  So, uh, you know, I mean, it doesn't matter who it is out there, I try to stand up for people's rights.
[01:26:31.823 --> 01:26:34.904]  And more often than not, get bit in the hind end for it, but I mean, I don't care.
[01:26:35.584 --> 01:26:37.665]  Folks, either we all hang together or we hang separate.
[01:26:39.186 --> 01:26:39.806]  It's that simple.
[01:26:41.673 --> 01:26:46.397]  And I see it in so many squad car videos on YouTube and on television and in my own life.
[01:26:47.038 --> 01:26:55.525]  I've been to trials of friends where the cops grab you out of the car, slam you to the ground, you don't even resist them, and they charge you with assaulting them.
[01:26:55.625 --> 01:26:56.746]  Watch the Abbey Newman video.
[01:26:57.694 --> 01:27:01.015]  It's a naval veteran, no criminal record, buying canning supplies in town.
[01:27:01.275 --> 01:27:02.455]  Doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.
[01:27:02.655 --> 01:27:04.576]  She comes to a checkpoint or search everybody's car.
[01:27:04.856 --> 01:27:05.576]  They want to search her.
[01:27:05.616 --> 01:27:06.276]  She says no.
[01:27:06.817 --> 01:27:09.817]  They jerk her out of the car and go, what are we going to charge you with?
[01:27:10.218 --> 01:27:11.318]  A saltinose?
[01:27:12.538 --> 01:27:17.480]  And they went home that night and went to sleep and felt good because she's not a human being to them.
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:19.920]  They become psychopathic and they don't even know it.
[01:27:20.741 --> 01:27:22.081]  I mean folks, it's psychopathic.
[01:27:23.092 --> 01:27:29.715]  You know how bad I would feel if I was a cop and I was about to ruin somebody's life and have them on probation or prison time?
[01:27:30.155 --> 01:27:32.016]  She was facing two counts of three years each.
[01:27:33.896 --> 01:27:39.439]  How bad I would feel if I was a cop if I was about to send some woman to prison for something she hadn't done?
[01:27:39.519 --> 01:27:41.079]  I mean, I would not be able to sleep.
[01:27:41.579 --> 01:27:42.980]  I would be racked with guilt.
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:46.201]  Because let me tell you something, my head is screwed on straight, folks.
[01:27:47.122 --> 01:27:52.784]  Because instinctively, in my very programming, I know that if I did bad stuff to people, that's going to come back on me.
[01:27:54.261 --> 01:27:57.842]  Now, at the conscious level, it's not a self-serving attitude that keeps you from being evil.
[01:27:58.682 --> 01:28:01.342]  At a conscious level, you know, it has the feeling of a moral.
[01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:04.883]  And, you know, I do the right thing because it feels good to me.
[01:28:05.903 --> 01:28:07.244]  The establishment calls that sappy.
[01:28:07.584 --> 01:28:10.104]  But really, it's just my ingrained self-preservation.
[01:28:10.504 --> 01:28:15.825]  I don't want to be in a tribe with a bunch of backstabbing, tattling, snitch scum all over the place.
[01:28:18.106 --> 01:28:18.846]  That's what we've become.
[01:28:18.986 --> 01:28:20.546]  Just a pack of evil.
[01:28:20.826 --> 01:28:21.787]  Not just our police.
[01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:23.407]  We're evil, folks.
[01:28:24.036 --> 01:28:25.237]  Have you watched our television?
[01:28:25.557 --> 01:28:26.998]  You've seen the 50 million abortions?
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:29.940]  You've seen what's going on?
[01:28:31.842 --> 01:28:33.803]  I mean, we are mooey wicked.
[01:28:35.505 --> 01:28:36.786]  We're some evil hombres.
[01:28:37.826 --> 01:28:40.088]  We've got to turn it around, folks, or we're going to be judged.
[01:28:40.448 --> 01:28:41.289]  It's the way it works.
[01:28:43.951 --> 01:28:44.872]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.352 --> 01:28:46.953]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.874 --> 01:28:50.556]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.369 --> 01:28:54.769]  Attention!
[01:28:54.889 --> 01:28:57.691]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[01:28:57.991 --> 01:29:02.294]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:29:02.614 --> 01:29:03.294]  Listen closely.
[01:29:03.955 --> 01:29:09.718]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product considered to be the single most powerful
[01:29:09.718 --> 01:29:09.938]  I think so.
[01:29:26.576 --> 01:29:36.038]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[01:29:36.238 --> 01:29:41.859]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[01:29:42.059 --> 01:29:45.620]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:49.200]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:29:53.729 --> 01:29:56.131]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:29:56.672 --> 01:30:06.301]  Did you know that in 1975, 32 senators and 92 representatives signed the Declaration of Interdependence, which stated that we must bring about a new world order?
[01:30:06.341 --> 01:30:11.045]  It called for the surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizations.
[01:30:11.065 --> 01:30:16.451]  It called for the redistribution of the wealth from America to third and fourth world countries.
[01:30:17.251 --> 01:30:27.495]  This is the same New World Order call for by former President George Herbert Walter Bush 210 times at the start of the Iraqi War 1990-1991.
[01:30:28.455 --> 01:30:36.198]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:30:36.838 --> 01:30:38.299]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:30:38.319 --> 01:30:38.700]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:39.160]  Call now.
[01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:41.822]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:30:53.797 --> 01:30:56.739]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:30:56.900 --> 01:31:02.144]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:31:02.424 --> 01:31:07.688]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:09.249]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:09.610 --> 01:31:18.517]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:31:18.917 --> 01:31:20.539]  Now compare a cowbend pure soap.
[01:31:20.759 --> 01:31:24.924]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:31:24.985 --> 01:31:29.610]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:31:29.991 --> 01:31:32.093]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:31:33.835 --> 01:31:34.596]  Keep it natural.
[01:31:34.896 --> 01:31:43.081]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[01:31:43.322 --> 01:31:47.464]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[01:31:47.484 --> 01:31:48.425]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:32:23.166 --> 01:32:29.148]  Monday through Friday, Defending Liberty, Resisting Tyranny from 11am until 2pm.
[01:32:30.169 --> 01:32:33.510]  Back on the Big Bird and the network 9 to midnight.
[01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:34.590]  Central Standard Time.
[01:32:34.630 --> 01:32:37.491]  You can listen on the internet whenever you wish.
[01:32:39.335 --> 01:32:41.538]  At Infowars.com.
[01:32:41.718 --> 01:32:42.319]  21 hours a day.
[01:32:42.359 --> 01:32:46.525]  We restream the show after the live program from 2 back until it starts again at 11 a.m.
[01:32:46.545 --> 01:32:51.391]  You can listen at 9 in the morning, 10 at night, doesn't matter, 3 a.m.
[01:32:51.411 --> 01:32:53.754]  You can also tune in via the podcast.
[01:32:54.295 --> 01:32:55.516]  At InfoWars.com.
[01:32:55.976 --> 01:32:57.036]  Free to subscribers.
[01:32:57.056 --> 01:33:00.898]  You just go click on it, and it goes right to your MP3 player, or iPod, or iPhone.
[01:33:01.438 --> 01:33:02.898]  I know a lot of you already use that.
[01:33:03.059 --> 01:33:04.379]  I hope you'll spread the word about it.
[01:33:04.419 --> 01:33:05.760]  That's how we reach new people.
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:10.602]  That's how, you know, instead of talking to yourself, blowing the face, which I think is also important, get my films.
[01:33:10.662 --> 01:33:11.462]  Make copies of them.
[01:33:11.502 --> 01:33:14.303]  Or the other Patriot documentaries that we carry, you're allowed to make copies of.
[01:33:16.324 --> 01:33:18.425]  Go get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:33:18.465 --> 01:33:19.325]  Print off 20, 30 copies of America.
[01:33:22.908 --> 01:33:23.889]  Destroyed by Design.
[01:33:24.230 --> 01:33:27.593]  Go print off copies of all of my films that are up there.
[01:33:27.614 --> 01:33:29.015]  Print off my books.
[01:33:29.896 --> 01:33:30.657]  The book I wrote.
[01:33:30.677 --> 01:33:32.679]  9-11, Dissent, and the Tyranny.
[01:33:32.719 --> 01:33:33.640]  Burn it onto disk.
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:34.741]  Put the file on a disk.
[01:33:35.042 --> 01:33:35.983]  Print out hard copies.
[01:33:36.043 --> 01:33:39.106]  Print out Order Out of Chaos, A Leech Monster, Terror, and the New World Order.
[01:33:39.387 --> 01:33:40.308]  No longer in print.
[01:33:40.688 --> 01:33:42.470]  I frankly don't have the money to print 5,000 more copies of it.
[01:33:43.797 --> 01:33:44.958]  It's probably never even sell that.
[01:33:45.038 --> 01:33:45.699]  It's a great book.
[01:33:45.739 --> 01:33:49.221]  We're getting a lot of requests for it, but we get to the point where we can't even print stuff again.
[01:33:49.241 --> 01:33:59.109]  Well, it's there at PrisonPlanet.tv, along with all my films, including the new Terror Storm special edition, and weekly TV reports, and just all this material.
[01:33:59.149 --> 01:34:00.290]  Thousands of pieces of media.
[01:34:00.690 --> 01:34:01.831]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:01.911 --> 01:34:02.791]  It is a foundry.
[01:34:03.272 --> 01:34:04.953]  It is an armory.
[01:34:05.133 --> 01:34:08.816]  It is an arsenal of resistance against the New World Order.
[01:34:10.808 --> 01:34:13.731]  And it is literally you, the listeners, that allow us to reach new people.
[01:34:14.651 --> 01:34:34.849]  And I think that it's safe to say that when you point people in the direction of this radio show, or my films, or the materials we offer, much of it free, that you're putting them in touch with some of the best information out there, bar none, because we cover it all, we've done our homework, we understand the New World Order's operations, and we're here fighting them toe-to-toe.
[01:34:36.264 --> 01:34:42.088]  Now, before I go to a loaded bank of calls, I'm going to take five calls in a row and that's going to be it for those holding the longest.
[01:34:43.029 --> 01:34:47.592]  And then I'm going to hit some news I haven't gotten to yet and recap some martial law news as well.
[01:34:49.002 --> 01:34:51.564]  Let me tell you about a couple of our sponsors.
[01:34:51.704 --> 01:34:57.850]  One of them is Shellicate, and the company that puts it out gives it the name of Shellocene.
[01:34:58.230 --> 01:35:04.636]  And really it's just 84 different types of minerals in ionic form mined out of the Himalayas.
[01:35:04.656 --> 01:35:07.119]  There's also one area in Scandinavia where you can find it.
[01:35:07.739 --> 01:35:10.602]  And it is an alluvial deposit of minerals.
[01:35:12.092 --> 01:35:14.695]  And it's powerful stuff.
[01:35:15.175 --> 01:35:17.898]  And minerals, more and more I learn and research, are the key.
[01:35:18.538 --> 01:35:20.280]  And they've got a deal until the end of this week.
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:21.901]  It's only until the end of the month.
[01:35:22.402 --> 01:35:23.723]  So I guess a few days into next week.
[01:35:24.123 --> 01:35:35.614]  And then he's going to stop offering this deal, where you can order it just with your name and address, no credit card number, and if you like it in three months, pay for the first order, they'll send you a second.
[01:35:36.172 --> 01:35:37.893]  I mean, you talk about try it before you buy it.
[01:35:38.174 --> 01:35:40.035]  This is literally try it before you buy it.
[01:35:40.375 --> 01:35:45.079]  It's not some gimmick where you give the credit card number and then can reverse it if you want and spend an hour doing that.
[01:35:45.359 --> 01:35:47.401]  This is if you like it, want to order more, you pay for it.
[01:35:47.921 --> 01:35:49.082]  You cannot beat that deal.
[01:35:49.102 --> 01:35:49.442]  877-327-0365.
[01:35:49.462 --> 01:35:49.582]  877-327-0365.
[01:35:49.602 --> 01:35:50.703]  Or blacklistedherb.com.
[01:35:50.723 --> 01:35:51.424]  Blacklistedherb.com.
[01:35:59.438 --> 01:36:08.189]  Also, you can check out all our sponsors including the one I'm about to tell you about at presentplanet.com there in the banner section there on the right hand side.
[01:36:10.492 --> 01:36:12.855]  There's also Researched Herbs at researchedherbs.com.
[01:36:14.611 --> 01:36:17.432]  And they've got hundreds of the well-documented, mainline stuff.
[01:36:17.452 --> 01:36:28.515]  By mainline, most of you, probably including myself, didn't know about them, that for hundreds of years have been known for their nutritive and healing effects for different problems, both preventative and once you have a problem.
[01:36:28.875 --> 01:36:31.736]  LIV52 is the world's best-selling liver support formula.
[01:36:32.016 --> 01:36:35.217]  Go find out about that one particular product there on their website.

[01:36:45.258 --> 01:36:54.606]  Or check out, not just Live52, but all their great products at researchedherbs.com.
[01:36:55.827 --> 01:36:57.789]  Let's go ahead, and I'm going to go fast here through your calls.
[01:36:58.109 --> 01:36:59.431]  Paul in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:36:59.471 --> 01:36:59.791]  Go ahead.
[01:37:00.399 --> 01:37:00.860]  Hi, Alex.
[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:02.121]  Many of us are grateful to Ms.
[01:37:02.181 --> 01:37:02.621]  Palfrey.
[01:37:02.681 --> 01:37:11.290]  She has done the unthinkable, and it's the only strategy when you've been targeted by these weakling cowards who, as you say, are in all these mafias within the system.
[01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:12.691]  People have to understand this.
[01:37:13.132 --> 01:37:20.179]  When you have a target on you, when they've targeted you, the only solution, the only way you're going to survive is to paint an even bigger target on your front.
[01:37:20.589 --> 01:37:22.370]  On your back and make a big noise.
[01:37:22.450 --> 01:37:24.091]  We have a circumstance in our family.
[01:37:24.131 --> 01:37:24.792]  It's ongoing.
[01:37:24.932 --> 01:37:28.454]  The court system shook us down for millions of dollars.
[01:37:28.474 --> 01:37:30.735]  There are people in our family who have been murdered over this.
[01:37:30.835 --> 01:37:32.356]  I can verify everything I say.
[01:37:32.776 --> 01:37:39.280]  And what stopped these bums, these no-good cowards in Naples, Florida and Providence, Rhode Island who frequent the courthouse
[01:37:39.716 --> 01:37:47.742]  What stopped them dead in their tracks, Alex, is when I went out to the internet and started writing about them, and now they're just tearing out their hair and they're beside themselves.
[01:37:47.762 --> 01:37:52.406]  They're threatening libel suits, and we say, good, go ahead, it'll be their undoing.
[01:37:52.806 --> 01:38:02.454]  These people are cowards, Alex, and like insects, you shine light on them, they wither, shrivel, and blow away in the wind like dried-up cow manure that they are.
[01:38:03.334 --> 01:38:04.315]  Well, absolutely.
[01:38:04.575 --> 01:38:11.242]  And some people are like, well, that woman doesn't have a right to defense or a right to her due process because of what she did and basically attacked her.
[01:38:11.622 --> 01:38:12.703]  It doesn't matter who you are.
[01:38:12.743 --> 01:38:14.005]  You deserve due process.
[01:38:14.165 --> 01:38:16.307]  People always say, let's get the globalists and string them up.
[01:38:16.667 --> 01:38:17.548]  No, let's have trials.
[01:38:18.869 --> 01:38:23.571]  We need to maintain our rule of law and our system, you know, number one.
[01:38:23.691 --> 01:38:24.911]  And it is going to see.
[01:38:24.951 --> 01:38:34.114]  That's what happened in Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany and China, is that these elites just get so abusive and their minions get so abusive that they start just wrecking the society.
[01:38:34.174 --> 01:38:37.115]  And right now, who can deny the bureaucrats aren't out of control?
[01:38:37.734 --> 01:38:43.880]  They're completely out of control and such sanctimony, such hypocrisy from these people criticizing Ms.
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:44.440]  Palfrey.
[01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:46.182]  What about her clients?
[01:38:46.422 --> 01:39:03.557]  And even worse, the scum, the human garbage that calls itself government agents, that harass this woman for committing absolutely no crime, for doing nothing wrong, other than the fact somebody might spill the beans on these bums and they'll be in trouble when they come home to their boyfriend at night.
[01:39:04.045 --> 01:39:04.625]  Absolutely.
[01:39:04.685 --> 01:39:06.246]  Go Mrs. Palfrey.
[01:39:06.286 --> 01:39:07.367]  Keep publicizing.
[01:39:07.827 --> 01:39:09.448]  These people hate publicity.
[01:39:09.508 --> 01:39:10.709]  It frightens them to death.
[01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:12.910]  And that's what she's saying.
[01:39:12.970 --> 01:39:15.432]  She's saying, why aren't you going after any of the Johns?
[01:39:15.472 --> 01:39:15.832]  That's it.
[01:39:15.872 --> 01:39:16.553]  I'm releasing it.
[01:39:17.273 --> 01:39:19.795]  And that'll certainly teach them next time.
[01:39:19.855 --> 01:39:20.795]  I appreciate your call.
[01:39:21.396 --> 01:39:22.836]  Let's talk to Phillip in Florida.
[01:39:22.876 --> 01:39:23.717]  Phillip, you're on the air.
[01:39:23.757 --> 01:39:24.177]  Go ahead.
[01:39:27.859 --> 01:39:28.680]  Going once, Phillip.
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:30.261]  Going twice, Phillip.
[01:39:30.896 --> 01:39:32.096]  Gone.
[01:39:32.236 --> 01:39:34.117]  Sean in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:39:34.137 --> 01:39:35.857]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:39:35.877 --> 01:39:36.217]  Good, sir.
[01:39:37.317 --> 01:39:50.580]  Well, I'm in Brooklyn, I've been here basically all my life, and I can tell you that from the time that I've been a kid up until now, I've been here all my life, you can see the intensity of the police department growing.
[01:39:51.460 --> 01:40:00.002]  Well, they've doubled the numbers, and I mean, they literally run up and just scream at people for no reason, and they've been told to let everybody know that they're the boss.
[01:40:01.629 --> 01:40:06.235]  I had an idea for the people going around with video cameras in New York.
[01:40:06.855 --> 01:40:13.323]  Perhaps they should take a laptop and maybe one of those wireless cards for Sprint or whoever.
[01:40:13.343 --> 01:40:14.424]  That's what people are already doing.
[01:40:14.465 --> 01:40:16.307]  WeAreChange.org does that all the time.
[01:40:16.727 --> 01:40:19.188]  Yeah, because they should stream it and archive it.
[01:40:19.228 --> 01:40:21.509]  That way, even if they take the camera, it's out there.
[01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:32.272]  Well, that's what happened when our reporters, when we are changed for InfoWars.com, just a month or so ago, were at the RNC debate, and they arrested them.
[01:40:32.332 --> 01:40:33.953]  They were wirelessly sending it out.
[01:40:34.133 --> 01:40:41.976]  I saw it live as it happened, and the technology is still a little bit shaky, but as it gets better, it's just going to be amazing.
[01:40:42.576 --> 01:40:43.016]  Anything else?
[01:40:43.496 --> 01:40:49.658]  Yeah, I had a comment on the eugenics that's going on, especially over in Africa.
[01:40:50.998 --> 01:41:04.081]  Basically, it seems like they're trying to wipe out the human DNA, and if you believe in evolution, that everybody came out of Africa, it's like they're trying to wipe out the original DNA so that it can't be rebuilt at some time in the future.
[01:41:05.922 --> 01:41:06.902]  Well, I know this.
[01:41:06.922 --> 01:41:07.542]  The elite
[01:41:08.957 --> 01:41:11.838]  are completely insane and they're schizophrenic at the same time.
[01:41:11.898 --> 01:41:12.798]  I appreciate your call.
[01:41:13.238 --> 01:41:25.822]  They openly have policies to end, you know, the white sub-race or the Anglo variety, Nordic variety.
[01:41:25.842 --> 01:41:28.963]  I mean, those policies have been declassified.
[01:41:28.983 --> 01:41:30.463]  These people are nuts.
[01:41:30.483 --> 01:41:32.784]  They have a policy to make sure white people
[01:41:34.267 --> 01:41:38.468]  At any cost, the media, the hype, end any of their diversity.
[01:41:38.508 --> 01:41:39.688]  People can marry whoever they want.
[01:41:39.728 --> 01:41:40.729]  It doesn't matter to me.
[01:41:40.749 --> 01:41:43.229]  My point is, why is the media aggressively pushing it?
[01:41:43.249 --> 01:41:44.049]  The point is, they are.
[01:41:44.490 --> 01:41:45.690]  So we're just reporting on that fact.
[01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:49.951]  At the same time, they have an agenda to tell blacks to intermarry, too.
[01:41:49.971 --> 01:41:57.953]  They don't want blacks staying cohesive or having any type of care about their group or any pride in their history.
[01:41:59.795 --> 01:42:04.057]  And then they certainly are carrying out more aggressively against Africans than any other group.
[01:42:04.097 --> 01:42:06.178]  And the New World Order has it out for Africa.
[01:42:06.338 --> 01:42:07.758]  See, we're just reporting the facts here.
[01:42:08.739 --> 01:42:10.460]  And that's what I mean by schizophrenic policy.
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:15.061]  The same elites have got it out for white people, the general, you know, whites.
[01:42:15.722 --> 01:42:18.843]  And a lot of evidence shows it's because they believe they're going to get competition from that group.
[01:42:18.863 --> 01:42:19.583]  In fact, they say that.
[01:42:20.003 --> 01:42:20.763]  I say a lot of evidence.
[01:42:20.783 --> 01:42:21.244]  They state it.
[01:42:21.284 --> 01:42:22.504]  So I just answered my own question.
[01:42:22.864 --> 01:42:24.545]  But it's important to ask those questions of yourselves.
[01:42:24.565 --> 01:42:25.845]  You'll come up with different angles of it.
[01:42:28.422 --> 01:42:29.763]  They really have it out for blacks.
[01:42:31.263 --> 01:42:34.725]  And then, secondarily, they have it out for Latin Americans.
[01:42:35.405 --> 01:42:37.106]  And then after that, they have it out for Asians.
[01:42:38.347 --> 01:42:51.793]  And, uh, I mean, the stuff they've done... I mean, I've got... I've got 1995 articles here out of the Times of London front page where top scientists in the government admitted that they were putting AIDS in smallpox shots in Africa.
[01:42:52.193 --> 01:42:55.435]  Like, I just came across that again today and was reminded of seeing it years ago.
[01:42:56.338 --> 01:42:59.020]  The media just says, oh, the conspiracy theorists say that.
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:01.942]  It's absolutely proven.
[01:43:02.362 --> 01:43:03.843]  It's not like it's our opinion.
[01:43:05.084 --> 01:43:10.747]  And that's what's so frustrating about this, is that they're doing this.
[01:43:10.767 --> 01:43:11.928]  These people are nuts, man.
[01:43:13.049 --> 01:43:16.511]  They say over and over again, they want to dumb down the mass of humanity.
[01:43:16.551 --> 01:43:19.273]  They want to dumb down their competition, which they're very racist.
[01:43:19.313 --> 01:43:21.194]  They see whites as their main competition.
[01:43:22.483 --> 01:43:25.865]  And so the elite at one level are waging war on the number of whites.
[01:43:27.306 --> 01:43:28.868]  And again, I'm not saying that's legitimate.
[01:43:28.888 --> 01:43:30.208]  What I'm saying is what the elite believes.
[01:43:30.228 --> 01:43:45.179]  They believe, specifically Nordics, blonde-haired, blue-eyed types, with the high cheekbones, they believe that that is the super-race and that they're actively trying to cull back the numbers of those because that's a competition for them.
[01:43:45.740 --> 01:44:03.594]  And at the same time, because they believe the non-dominant variant of Homo sapiens sapiens, the Anglo, since it's so precious, and since blacks have the original DNA code, and it just tends to be more dominant, that they need to be exterminated first and foremost.
[01:44:03.634 --> 01:44:04.054]  So yes.
[01:44:04.915 --> 01:44:06.456]  A, they're knocking out their competition.
[01:44:07.277 --> 01:44:08.698]  B, they want to kill the blacks.
[01:44:08.718 --> 01:44:11.100]  That's their near and dear heart to do that.
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:13.842]  And kill everybody else for that matter.
[01:44:14.569 --> 01:44:17.290]  I mean, it's so incredible when you read book after book.
[01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:23.513]  I mean, I was up here last night finishing the final voiceover for Endgame, and I just didn't know... I had to cut it down.
[01:44:23.533 --> 01:44:26.994]  It took me days because I couldn't make the film five hours long.
[01:44:27.554 --> 01:44:33.136]  It's already 130 plus minutes long, and I've already cut about as much as I can cut.
[01:44:34.937 --> 01:44:35.897]  I'm already digressing.
[01:44:35.917 --> 01:44:36.217]  What is it?
[01:44:36.578 --> 01:44:40.139]  It's just... It's just so incredible.
[01:44:41.903 --> 01:44:49.867]  And then to have these Live Aid concerts, and Earth Aid, and Live Earth, and, oh, we're helping the Africans, is so cynical!
[01:44:51.668 --> 01:44:59.431]  I mean, Planned Parenthood's helping the blacks, and the Gates, and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Warren Buffett are helping them.
[01:45:00.152 --> 01:45:04.754]  Meanwhile, we got quotes from Ted Turner, you know, giving a billion to do it, calling them all sorts of names.
[01:45:06.013 --> 01:45:12.317]  I mean, I cannot imagine being a multi-billionaire and wanting to give my money away to sterilize black people.
[01:45:14.219 --> 01:45:15.660]  I mean, can you imagine that?
[01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:17.361]  When, by the way, that won't work.
[01:45:17.841 --> 01:45:20.783]  It just shows that those that aren't sterilized just end up having the five children.
[01:45:22.084 --> 01:45:25.387]  What works is going and lifting those people up and industrializing them.
[01:45:25.987 --> 01:45:27.848]  And people say, well, blacks can't be industrialized.
[01:45:27.868 --> 01:45:30.050]  They always, you know, descend into butchery.
[01:45:31.952 --> 01:45:34.094]  Well, most primitive societies do that.
[01:45:34.154 --> 01:45:37.817]  It's very rare that you get a society, a free society, where it's able to build.
[01:45:38.317 --> 01:45:39.438]  You're able to get a renaissance.
[01:45:40.319 --> 01:45:49.926]  I mean, the Germanic tribes were killing each other for thousands of years and could never build up a civilization, even though they were very smart, because they were too busy killing each other and enslaving each other, just like the Africans.
[01:45:50.327 --> 01:46:00.255]  So I've actually studied sociology and ancient sociology, archaeology, and the ancient cultures, and so a lot of the stereotypes you see put on black civilization
[01:46:01.295 --> 01:46:02.555]  aren't particularly accurate.
[01:46:02.775 --> 01:46:06.136]  Or let's say they're taking data and then mis-extrapolating it.
[01:46:06.436 --> 01:46:12.577]  Like, I know for a fact that they'll go finance one tribe to kill another every time they build a city or a civilization.
[01:46:12.817 --> 01:46:15.298]  Or every time blacks get some resources.
[01:46:16.938 --> 01:46:23.279]  Blacks actually do organize themselves into operating societies in many cases thousands of years ago.
[01:46:25.939 --> 01:46:28.660]  And then climate change and other things knock those civilizations out.
[01:46:29.688 --> 01:46:34.031]  Uh... but uh... I mean regardless folks, regardless.
[01:46:34.071 --> 01:46:35.752]  Let's say you're a racist and you don't like black people.
[01:46:36.772 --> 01:46:38.513]  I just want to give you a little news tip.
[01:46:38.633 --> 01:46:40.514]  You're not going to be safe with this elite running things.
[01:46:40.554 --> 01:46:41.915]  By the way, you're in the crosshairs too.
[01:46:42.796 --> 01:46:44.657]  And we all just have to come to that realization.
[01:46:44.677 --> 01:46:48.319]  I mean that's what I tell these radical racist Mexicans in La Reconquista.
[01:46:49.130 --> 01:46:51.512]  I'm like, what do you think you're doing with your Raza and all this?
[01:46:51.952 --> 01:46:53.593]  And, oh yeah, you're going to bring down America.
[01:46:53.933 --> 01:47:04.180]  Don't you know the globalists are using you and opening the door for you and literally greasing the skids and telling the police that you live by two sets of rules and that you're above the law?
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:06.461]  I mean, why do you think the door is open?
[01:47:07.002 --> 01:47:08.883]  Why do you think you're getting VIP status?
[01:47:08.963 --> 01:47:11.044]  It's not to help you and your people.
[01:47:11.184 --> 01:47:13.266]  I mean, let me give you a newsflash here.
[01:47:14.006 --> 01:47:16.027]  You're being used to bring this country down.
[01:47:16.328 --> 01:47:16.808]  Period.
[01:47:17.552 --> 01:47:20.993]  And the same thing for the radical black groups like Khalid Mohammed.
[01:47:22.273 --> 01:47:24.114]  We never played that clip of him.
[01:47:24.594 --> 01:47:26.875]  Do you have the one where all the GDs and stuff were cut out of it?
[01:47:28.955 --> 01:47:30.756]  I despair the moment I told John to find that.
[01:47:30.796 --> 01:47:31.836]  We never heard it a few weeks ago.
[01:47:31.856 --> 01:47:33.037]  You know, we kill the women?
[01:47:33.057 --> 01:47:34.977]  Why don't we kill the white babies?
[01:47:35.077 --> 01:47:37.598]  Beautiful, blue-eyed, blonde-haired babies.
[01:47:38.198 --> 01:47:39.358]  Why don't we kill the woman?
[01:47:39.419 --> 01:47:44.380]  Because when the white woman lays down on her back every nine months, the reinforcements roll out.
[01:47:45.293 --> 01:47:47.515]  Well, see, that's the elite's attitude, Mr. Muhammad.
[01:47:47.735 --> 01:47:48.456]  That's what he says!
[01:47:49.076 --> 01:47:52.039]  He said, well, they've been killing us, we're gonna kill them!
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:55.101]  That's what the New World Order said.
[01:47:56.822 --> 01:47:57.543]  That's what they say.
[01:47:57.603 --> 01:47:58.624]  They say it's whoever can kill.
[01:47:58.644 --> 01:47:59.945]  It's whoever can take over.
[01:48:01.186 --> 01:48:03.047]  Let me tell the black leadership something.
[01:48:03.288 --> 01:48:08.732]  The New World Order can snap its fingers and kill every black person on the planet in a matter of weeks.
[01:48:09.693 --> 01:48:12.115]  Those that aren't living below ground in pressurized facilities.
[01:48:12.873 --> 01:48:17.798]  They got stuff on the shelf that will kill people by specific genose subtypes.
[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:22.703]  They got stuff that will kill a Belgian, but won't kill your average German.
[01:48:23.124 --> 01:48:26.367]  But if that German's mama was a Belgian, he's gonna be dead.
[01:48:27.754 --> 01:48:36.461]  They got stuff that will kill Arabs, but won't kill a Jew unless they've got more than half Semitic blood in them.
[01:48:36.501 --> 01:48:38.483]  So 80 plus percent of the Jews would live and survive.
[01:48:38.963 --> 01:48:40.525]  80 plus percent are not truly Semitic.
[01:48:41.005 --> 01:48:42.366]  And then they openly talk about this.
[01:48:42.426 --> 01:48:45.569]  I mean, we're here at the edge of total destruction.
[01:48:45.769 --> 01:48:47.391]  And I don't mean some fake Cold War
[01:48:51.167 --> 01:48:53.290]  Mumbo-jumbo about the Russians are going to nuke us.
[01:48:53.370 --> 01:48:54.071]  It was all staged.
[01:48:54.492 --> 01:48:59.919]  I mean, they got real bioweapons and they're openly discussing and considering when they're going to use them on us.
[01:49:03.043 --> 01:49:08.390]  And I just want people to know as this stuff happens, frankly, most of us right now are dead.
[01:49:09.133 --> 01:49:11.235]  We're dead already, and you just better realize that.
[01:49:11.595 --> 01:49:14.357]  There's a small chance God would give us some reprieve.
[01:49:14.397 --> 01:49:20.461]  Even if you're secular, there's a small chance that the elite will back off and stop it, but I don't see that.
[01:49:20.481 --> 01:49:28.346]  These people, most of them are 75 years old with heart problems, who are completely decadent and love death, and they're just total scum.
[01:49:29.707 --> 01:49:30.728]  And they're nuts.
[01:49:31.529 --> 01:49:32.870]  They're absolutely nuts.
[01:49:36.565 --> 01:49:40.692]  My God, folks, if you've studied what I've studied, you'd understand why I can't even tell you.
[01:49:41.133 --> 01:49:42.835]  I can't even explain it, it's so big and bad.
[01:49:42.855 --> 01:49:45.500]  I mean, it's just off the charts.
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:47.202]  That's the word, off the charts.
[01:49:47.863 --> 01:49:48.785]  It's off the charts.
[01:49:56.977 --> 01:50:02.463]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.824 --> 01:50:10.452]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.167 --> 01:50:18.210]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.610 --> 01:50:30.055]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.355 --> 01:50:33.856]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.316 --> 01:50:36.257]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.577 --> 01:50:40.419]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:56.763 --> 01:50:59.544]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:50:59.804 --> 01:51:03.965]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:51:04.385 --> 01:51:05.186]  So what do you do?
[01:51:05.206 --> 01:51:10.107]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:51:10.587 --> 01:51:12.708]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:51:13.208 --> 01:51:14.089]  Sheltering in Place!
[01:51:14.509 --> 01:51:18.210]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[01:51:18.531 --> 01:51:27.895]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:51:53.863 --> 01:52:05.794]  JLS Research, the makers of the all-natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates that those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[01:52:05.954 --> 01:52:12.500]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:20.186]  By using organic and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[01:52:20.526 --> 01:52:23.589]  As it responds, body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[01:52:23.869 --> 01:52:27.512]  First Responder is the first of its kind, comprised of only four organics.
[01:52:27.812 --> 01:52:31.195]  Grape seed skins, grape seed, grapefruit seed, and garlic.
[01:52:31.475 --> 01:52:36.059]  It's so effective you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[01:52:36.399 --> 01:52:37.600]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.
[01:52:39.301 --> 01:52:41.462]  Go online and order First Responder at no-bo.com.
[01:52:41.502 --> 01:52:43.983]  Visit no-bo.com or call JLS Research at 850-723-8599.
[01:52:44.023 --> 01:52:44.263]  That's 850-723-8599.
[01:52:44.363 --> 01:52:45.723]  All I've tried to do is tell you the truth.
[01:53:10.490 --> 01:53:14.792]  All I attempted to do was research as best I could and find out the truth.
[01:53:16.433 --> 01:53:18.114]  And I get deeper into the truth every day.
[01:53:18.134 --> 01:53:21.635]  We weren't wrong about our analysis in the past.
[01:53:21.655 --> 01:53:24.717]  We just underestimated just how dire things are.
[01:53:24.837 --> 01:53:26.238]  Just how far along they are.
[01:53:27.258 --> 01:53:29.639]  Just how serious they are.
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:33.021]  And I'm going to tell you something right now.
[01:53:34.321 --> 01:53:35.822]  And I can tell you this with all certainty.
[01:53:37.063 --> 01:53:39.664]  The gravy train is ending.
[01:53:41.807 --> 01:53:50.935]  And if you don't get involved now, if you don't speak up now, if you don't fight the new old order now, we don't have any hope.
[01:53:53.377 --> 01:53:54.598]  I know that much.
[01:53:55.598 --> 01:54:05.667]  I know we've got loaded phones lined with Josh and Brandon and many others that are patiently holding here.
[01:54:06.932 --> 01:54:08.673]  I just look at the articles of the last week.
[01:54:08.753 --> 01:54:12.555]  Proof Bin Laden tape is five years old, re-release footage, documented, admitted.
[01:54:13.716 --> 01:54:17.458]  Bush administration officials thought WC2 towers were charged, his biographer.
[01:54:18.358 --> 01:54:21.640]  Former Reagan official, Bush may stage false flag terror, reinstate the draft.
[01:54:22.561 --> 01:54:34.527]  And now Bush has told Congress that, told Congress, that they're not allowed to see the continuity of government martial law plans.
[01:54:34.607 --> 01:54:36.108]  And that's mainstream news.
[01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:38.121]  That is martial law.
[01:54:39.081 --> 01:54:40.022]  Then I've got another article here.
[01:54:40.062 --> 01:54:46.306]  Bush signed an executive order when Congress passed a law saying no more mercury in vaccines.
[01:54:46.767 --> 01:54:49.829]  First off, remember five years ago they told you they took the mercury out?
[01:54:50.309 --> 01:54:51.510]  First they said there was no mercury.
[01:54:51.530 --> 01:54:52.631]  Remember six, seven years ago.
[01:54:52.871 --> 01:54:54.552]  You can plot and chronicle all this.
[01:54:55.073 --> 01:54:56.273]  You can chart it.
[01:54:56.854 --> 01:54:58.515]  First they said there was no mercury.
[01:54:59.306 --> 01:55:01.728]  Then they said there was mercury and it was good for you.
[01:55:02.148 --> 01:55:03.789]  Then they said they took the mercury out.
[01:55:04.109 --> 01:55:06.050]  Now they said mercury was good for you again.
[01:55:06.511 --> 01:55:09.993]  Then they said they took it out again, and you notice it's in every major vaccine.
[01:55:10.513 --> 01:55:23.281]  What the federal regulators said was that companies should, if they want, that they're encouraged to, there's not even a strong regulation, to create lots available that don't have thimerosal in them.
[01:55:23.301 --> 01:55:23.702]  Eli Lilly.
[01:55:25.583 --> 01:55:26.564]  Where is it in my stack?
[01:55:26.604 --> 01:55:27.104]  I had it here.
[01:55:29.542 --> 01:55:32.965]  And so, I should have spent all day on this article alone.
[01:55:33.045 --> 01:55:34.446]  It was over the weekend.
[01:55:34.466 --> 01:55:36.108]  It's up on Infowars.net.
[01:55:38.009 --> 01:55:39.270]  And the great work of Steve Watson.
[01:55:42.593 --> 01:55:46.236]  And Bush just comes right out and says, no, we're going to keep the mercury in.
[01:55:47.357 --> 01:55:51.941]  Folks, they know full well that has brain damaged millions and millions of our boys.
[01:55:53.562 --> 01:55:55.824]  And then the media goes, but see, it's genetic.
[01:55:57.009 --> 01:56:04.294]  Boys, ladies and gentlemen, those boys don't have the gene, or it's inactive, that allows it to pass the blood-brain barrier.
[01:56:05.354 --> 01:56:08.516]  It is a gene sequence that's off in many males.
[01:56:09.257 --> 01:56:11.458]  And it also correlates to the age of the male.
[01:56:11.738 --> 01:56:16.701]  The truth is it's a problem with sperm, generally in men over 40 years of age or men who have used drugs.
[01:56:17.081 --> 01:56:19.122]  But that only adds to it.
[01:56:19.182 --> 01:56:24.946]  That is some of the cases, but the vast majority are caused by the mercury.
[01:56:26.989 --> 01:56:33.710]  And it usually expresses in boys that already have the absorption problem, who absorb too much of it.
[01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:39.671]  And it's the same gene that affects tissues in the gut that block out toxins.
[01:56:39.691 --> 01:56:41.472]  I don't know, it gets real complex.
[01:56:41.512 --> 01:56:43.652]  I've spent many, many days studying it over the years.
[01:56:44.992 --> 01:56:53.214]  We've got that story, and of course the big one of the day, and this one really upset me this weekend.
[01:56:53.234 --> 01:56:54.134]  I mean, this is serious.
[01:56:55.029 --> 01:57:00.132]  Bush-Marshall Law Plan is so shocking, even Congress can't see it.
[01:57:01.473 --> 01:57:05.095]  Now, now, that's the biggin' and I hope you get it out to everybody.
[01:57:05.155 --> 01:57:07.576]  It's oninforwarriors.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:57:07.977 --> 01:57:13.039]  Big report coming out on one of the FEMA Deputy Directors being confronted by We Are Change.
[01:57:13.059 --> 01:57:14.040]  Just incredible folks.
[01:57:16.101 --> 01:57:17.382]  Just amazing job they're doing.
[01:57:17.402 --> 01:57:18.142]  They're on fire.
[01:57:18.202 --> 01:57:20.724]  That's the type of leadership we need to see from all of you right now.
[01:57:22.036 --> 01:57:25.537]  They're just on fire, confronting FEMA on the camps and Building 7.
[01:57:26.077 --> 01:57:27.818]  That'll be up on Jones Report in the next few hours.
[01:57:28.578 --> 01:57:29.438]  God bless you all!
[01:57:33.859 --> 01:57:37.760]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:38.880]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.131 --> 01:57:50.772]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.452 --> 01:57:52.473]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.213 --> 01:57:54.314]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.995 --> 01:57:55.775]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.556 --> 01:57:57.457]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.117 --> 01:58:01.900]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.301 --> 01:58:06.424]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.107 --> 01:58:16.171]  I've been on national television, I don't know, 60, 70 times over the years.
[01:58:17.152 --> 01:58:18.133]  On different programs.
[01:58:20.069 --> 01:58:27.854]  Some of those programs have aired 20, 30 times a piece, like the Trio Network Masters of the Universe piece that I was in, that John Ronson did.
[01:58:28.374 --> 01:58:31.416]  So a lot of times I don't even tune in when I'm on television.
[01:58:31.476 --> 01:58:32.576]  I really don't watch a lot of TV.
[01:58:32.636 --> 01:58:33.997]  I don't like watching myself.
[01:58:36.139 --> 01:58:41.722]  But last night I sat down and I did watch the History Channel piece.
[01:58:42.469 --> 01:58:56.578]  And I have to tell you, it has won quite a distinction with me as the worst hit piece, the most multi-faceted, multi-layered hit piece I have ever seen in my life.
[01:58:57.358 --> 01:59:04.523]  And I don't mean a hit piece towards myself, the worst of any hit piece I've been the victim of, or that I've had directed at me.
[01:59:05.343 --> 01:59:09.846]  This is the worst hit piece I have ever seen on any subject with any individual.
[01:59:11.224 --> 01:59:24.652]  Brad Davis, the producer and the director of the piece, an NBC producer, we learned after the fact, with deep searching on the internet, I did confirm with him that it was the case, is a specialist in deception.
[01:59:25.492 --> 01:59:35.418]  He's the guy that got the big Dateline NBC piece on Michael Jackson, who snuck up to him, who got into his confidence, and got the crews to be able to follow him around, only to drop the boom on him.
[01:59:36.018 --> 01:59:36.658]  And that's fine.
[01:59:36.678 --> 01:59:39.220]  You're a snake, and you go after other snakes like Michael Jackson.
[01:59:39.804 --> 01:59:44.165]  The difference is, I am not a snake buddy, and you are a liar.
[01:59:44.245 --> 01:59:58.109]  Brad Davis is a liar, and I know he's listening right now, and he is a coward, and he knows his film is a fraud and a lie, and you have destroyed your name forever.
[01:59:58.169 --> 01:59:58.589]  Not me.
[01:59:59.310 --> 02:00:00.410]  You tried to destroy me.
[02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:01.990]  I'm the main target of the piece.
[02:00:02.671 --> 02:00:03.651]  You tried to destroy me.
[02:00:04.634 --> 02:00:05.855]  And you've destroyed yourself.
[02:00:05.915 --> 02:00:08.077]  You will be known now as the Yellow Journalist Forever.
[02:00:08.538 --> 02:00:14.143]  Your name will go down in history, if anybody ever checks it, as working for Hearst Publishing, NBC.
[02:00:15.044 --> 02:00:18.107]  You will be known as putting out a fraud and a lie.
[02:00:19.288 --> 02:00:21.330]  And we're going to have piece after piece on this.
[02:00:22.536 --> 02:00:26.499]  We're going to have the clips of the video to analyze each lie.
[02:00:27.339 --> 02:00:32.262]  We're going to go over every bit of it in the months to come, and we're going to be talking about you five years from now.
[02:00:32.622 --> 02:00:36.364]  You're going to have your little History Channel piece that five million people watched last night.
[02:00:37.145 --> 02:00:38.125]  I checked out the ratings.
[02:00:38.185 --> 02:00:42.148]  That's in that slot, generally four and a half to five and a half million.
[02:00:42.808 --> 02:00:51.193]  I haven't seen the ratings yet for that particular two-hour period, but we know that Monday nights, eight to ten central, nine to eleven eastern,
[02:00:51.834 --> 02:00:57.094]  Is the absolute prime time for History Channel, routinely audiences of four and a half to five and a half mil.
[02:00:58.291 --> 02:01:00.012]  It's going to air again tonight at midnight.
[02:01:00.072 --> 02:01:02.272]  It's going to air this Saturday at 8 o'clock at night.
[02:01:02.312 --> 02:01:03.933]  It's going to air Sunday in the evening.
[02:01:03.993 --> 02:01:06.694]  It's going to air over and over and over again.
[02:01:06.754 --> 02:01:09.934]  I've looked at this particular series, that time slot.
[02:01:10.255 --> 02:01:17.097]  They will generally air it 15 times this year alone and then air it another 10 times next year.
[02:01:17.437 --> 02:01:18.657]  You know, they air stuff over and over again.
[02:01:19.377 --> 02:01:22.158]  Over the years it will probably air 30, 40 times.
[02:01:23.358 --> 02:01:24.879]  Tens of millions tuning in.
[02:01:26.451 --> 02:01:30.254]  Just last night and tonight, tens of millions will be seeing it.
[02:01:30.734 --> 02:01:40.442]  A tissue of lies, a manifest fraud of slander, of defamation, of libel.
[02:01:42.464 --> 02:01:44.465]  It is off the charts.
[02:01:44.645 --> 02:01:48.668]  I have never seen anything even approaching this.
[02:01:50.126 --> 02:01:51.767]  And I told 9-11 truthers.
[02:01:52.288 --> 02:01:53.308]  I said, this is a hit piece.
[02:01:53.388 --> 02:01:54.969]  Once he showed up, I said, he's lying.
[02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:56.270]  I told the Austinites.
[02:01:56.330 --> 02:01:57.651]  I said, this is a hit piece from hell.
[02:01:57.971 --> 02:01:58.832]  No, it's not.
[02:01:59.092 --> 02:02:01.254]  Brad Davis is nice.
[02:02:02.374 --> 02:02:05.016]  And I told other people who were in this piece being attacked.
[02:02:05.036 --> 02:02:05.997]  I said, it's a hit piece.
[02:02:06.417 --> 02:02:08.158]  Oh, I think it's too soon to say that.
[02:02:08.859 --> 02:02:11.981]  Well, hey, it ain't too soon to say it now, is it?
[02:02:14.983 --> 02:02:19.106]  You know, I got a pretty good brain inside my skull.
[02:02:20.535 --> 02:02:22.658]  Did any of you predict 9-11 before it happened?
[02:02:25.181 --> 02:02:27.004]  Any of you reach as many people as I have?
[02:02:29.787 --> 02:02:37.678]  And all I'm saying is, I don't want to command people, I don't want to be your leader, but at least you ought to listen to my advice.
[02:02:46.284 --> 02:02:51.249]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:02:51.549 --> 02:02:53.791]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[02:02:53.851 --> 02:02:56.994]  Our Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:02:57.034 --> 02:03:01.318]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[02:03:01.678 --> 02:03:04.681]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:03:05.001 --> 02:03:08.424]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:03:08.744 --> 02:03:18.109]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:03:18.369 --> 02:03:21.850]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[02:03:48.564 --> 02:03:54.009]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:54.389 --> 02:04:02.036]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.717 --> 02:04:09.759]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:10.179 --> 02:04:21.603]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.903 --> 02:04:25.424]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.884 --> 02:04:27.805]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:28.125 --> 02:04:31.986]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:47.621]  Want to know my little secret?
[02:04:48.181 --> 02:04:52.623]  I have rich, delicious chocolate as much as I want, every single day.
[02:04:53.084 --> 02:04:54.725]  And I never feel bad about it.
[02:04:55.205 --> 02:05:00.028]  Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea gives you real, natural cocoa, without any fat or sugar.
[02:05:00.788 --> 02:05:07.712]  Even better, Cocoa Pure is made with nutrients that keep my heart healthy, my energy levels up, and my body looking great.
[02:05:08.292 --> 02:05:13.355]  I'm having smooth, tasty chocolate every single day, and it's helping me stay healthier than ever.
[02:05:14.055 --> 02:05:18.238]  You can give yourself the gift of health by calling for a bottle of Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea.
[02:05:18.779 --> 02:05:21.521]  The only thing better than chocolate is healthy chocolate.
[02:05:21.961 --> 02:05:25.564]  Here's how you can get a bottle of delicious Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea.
[02:05:26.425 --> 02:05:30.028]  For your wrist-free bottle of Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea, call 1-800-894-3596.
[02:05:30.048 --> 02:05:37.113]  And if you call now, you can find out how to get a free bottle of Cocoa Pure with your order.
[02:05:37.253 --> 02:05:37.513]  Call 1-800-894-3596.
[02:05:37.533 --> 02:05:37.814]  That's 1-800-894-3596.
[02:05:46.679 --> 02:05:52.303]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.383 --> 02:06:00.367]  Alright, in the future we'll play clips of this Hearst Publishing yellow journalism abomination.
[02:06:02.229 --> 02:06:12.715]  But we've just now gotten back into work today and have the video, so we'll be doing that over the next few days and we'll take our time dissecting each technical lie and each technical fraud
[02:06:13.849 --> 02:06:21.252]  But that's not where the main body of the of the lying sets.
[02:06:23.933 --> 02:06:27.234]  Paul Watson, I had about a 45 minute discussion with him today.
[02:06:27.254 --> 02:06:38.858]  In the next hour up on PrisonPlanet.com we are going to post the definitive article out of the gates about this hit piece.
[02:06:39.691 --> 02:06:45.134]  My behind-the-scenes discussions with the director and producer Brad the Deceptive Davis.
[02:06:46.754 --> 02:06:51.117]  We are going to be going over all of the information.
[02:06:51.417 --> 02:07:02.422]  It will be in there and it's important that you get this particular article and that you forewind it to every MySpace account, every Yahoo account, every email list that you posted on every message board.
[02:07:02.962 --> 02:07:13.788]  Because whenever somebody types in, by the way, notice they kept the name secret, because last time a copy of the Popular Mechanics hit piece got out a month before it hit print, and it was totally debunked before it came out.
[02:07:14.088 --> 02:07:20.491]  So notice they were calling it 9-11 Conspiracies, but the real name was 9-11 Conspiracies Fact or Fiction.
[02:07:21.091 --> 02:07:23.052]  Even on their own website they didn't show the full name.
[02:07:23.432 --> 02:07:24.553]  Now they've got a bigger page up.
[02:07:25.934 --> 02:07:30.696]  And by the way, Neocons on Dig, a few weeks ago it was going to be showing on the 9th,
[02:07:33.394 --> 02:07:34.115]  I don't know.
[02:07:55.313 --> 02:07:56.093]  They took it down!
[02:07:56.153 --> 02:07:57.854]  And then we pointed out, oh look, they took it down!
[02:07:58.135 --> 02:08:01.276]  And neocons wrote articles saying, look at these delusional liars!
[02:08:01.716 --> 02:08:03.317]  They took it down!
[02:08:03.337 --> 02:08:09.240]  No, they're saying they took it down because of them with just some broken link on the History Channel website!
[02:08:09.661 --> 02:08:12.182]  Look how nuts the twofers are, as they call us!
[02:08:13.663 --> 02:08:17.105]  That's what the different quote-quote debunking websites said.
[02:08:20.686 --> 02:08:21.347]  No, we
[02:08:22.481 --> 02:08:28.565]  Have Brad Davis, in shorthand, everything he said in that conversation, on speakerphone, Aaron Dykes, writing it all down.
[02:08:30.286 --> 02:08:35.570]  We have it all written down, and yes, you're going to see articles, and you're going to see the information, and it's all going to come out.
[02:08:36.411 --> 02:08:36.731]  Okay?
[02:08:37.351 --> 02:08:42.895]  And he was gulping and begging for me... Well, let me just go through this step-by-step.
[02:08:43.832 --> 02:08:45.753]  Let me just go through this step-by-step, okay?
[02:08:46.093 --> 02:08:47.973]  And this isn't because it's about Alex Jones.
[02:08:48.434 --> 02:08:52.015]  It's because it's about 9-11 truth, and it's about dishonest media.
[02:08:52.475 --> 02:08:56.036]  This is why mainstream corporate media is losing many of its viewers.
[02:08:56.416 --> 02:08:57.857]  It's why they're in rapid decline.
[02:08:58.317 --> 02:09:04.119]  It's why even cable television has lost 20 to 30 percent of its viewers in the last five years, depending on which channel it is.
[02:09:04.479 --> 02:09:06.740]  It's why that acceleration is intensifying.
[02:09:07.435 --> 02:09:10.036]  Because people know you've got an agenda.
[02:09:10.517 --> 02:09:15.859]  They know you're a pack of twisters and spinners and, in this case, outright fabricators and liars.
[02:09:18.361 --> 02:09:20.882]  So you can pull all the tricks you want all day long.
[02:09:22.143 --> 02:09:22.783]  It's not going to work.
[02:09:23.063 --> 02:09:24.824]  First off, let's talk about dishonesty.
[02:09:26.125 --> 02:09:28.526]  Popular Mechanics called me two years ago.
[02:09:30.507 --> 02:09:37.572]  Months before the piece came out, and the person was stuttering and gibbering on the phone so bad that I didn't believe it was Popular Mechanics.
[02:09:38.513 --> 02:09:47.659]  So I called and asked to speak to Benjamin Chertoff, who was the editor over the piece, and he said, Mr. Jones, I swear to you it's not a hit piece.
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:50.001]  I swear to you it's not a debunking piece.
[02:09:50.041 --> 02:09:50.962]  I haven't used that term.
[02:09:50.982 --> 02:09:53.443]  I said, is this a debunking piece?
[02:09:53.483 --> 02:09:54.324]  He said, no, no, no.
[02:09:54.624 --> 02:09:55.625]  We're just showing both sides.
[02:09:55.645 --> 02:09:56.265]  It's about your movement.
[02:09:56.285 --> 02:09:58.167]  He goes, I give you my word.
[02:09:58.607 --> 02:09:59.628]  There's no agenda here.
[02:10:01.977 --> 02:10:10.002]  And I had been interviewed hundreds of times by newspapers, fifty-something times by TV by then, and I had never called to see if it was fake.
[02:10:10.082 --> 02:10:15.326]  I mean, I thought it was maybe a high school student for a newspaper doing a prank interview or something, you know.
[02:10:16.046 --> 02:10:21.269]  Or I thought it might have been some radio talk show, because some of those comedy shows do it where they act like they're fake reporters.
[02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:26.973]  I mean, I thought it was because it was like, what you think about the seismography?
[02:10:27.353 --> 02:10:28.414]  And I was like, excuse me?
[02:10:29.314 --> 02:10:32.917]  And then the reporter would bring up a point.
[02:10:32.937 --> 02:10:34.158]  He sounded like he was about 13.
[02:10:34.538 --> 02:10:35.819]  I'm not joking when I say that.
[02:10:35.839 --> 02:10:38.260]  That's not a figure of speech or hyperbole.
[02:10:39.761 --> 02:10:41.262]  And I would bring up a fact.
[02:10:41.322 --> 02:10:49.068]  He'd say, you wrote this article saying that the seismograph showed this.
[02:10:49.208 --> 02:10:52.009]  I called the seismograph people.
[02:10:52.330 --> 02:10:53.891]  They say they not talk to you.
[02:10:55.372 --> 02:10:57.133]  And I said, well, tell me the headline.
[02:10:57.153 --> 02:10:58.694]  I pulled it up and I said, I didn't even write that.
[02:10:59.736 --> 02:11:03.497]  I said, that's another article written by American Free Press.
[02:11:03.977 --> 02:11:05.557]  And I said, and yeah, we posted the story.
[02:11:05.797 --> 02:11:08.678]  Can't you see it says Christopher Bolin?
[02:11:08.958 --> 02:11:10.598]  Can't you see it says his name?
[02:11:10.858 --> 02:11:13.959]  OK, let's move on to something else now.
[02:11:14.879 --> 02:11:15.979]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[02:11:16.579 --> 02:11:17.640]  So I said, hold on a minute.
[02:11:17.660 --> 02:11:18.920]  I said, I'll have to call you back tomorrow.
[02:11:19.140 --> 02:11:20.340]  So I call.
[02:11:20.380 --> 02:11:21.300]  I get the number to Hearst.
[02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:22.761]  I asked for the editor.
[02:11:22.781 --> 02:11:24.641]  And then they called back like an hour later.
[02:11:24.981 --> 02:11:27.102]  Hello, this is Michael Chertoff.
[02:11:27.762 --> 02:11:29.422]  I mean, this is Benjamin Chertoff.
[02:11:31.161 --> 02:11:33.061]  Oh, Alex, we promise you!
[02:11:33.362 --> 02:11:34.542]  Oh, no!
[02:11:34.902 --> 02:11:35.962]  Oh, no!
[02:11:38.923 --> 02:11:39.683]  So they lined there.
[02:11:40.583 --> 02:11:42.224]  Then this Brad Davis calls up here.
[02:11:42.344 --> 02:11:44.124]  I'm really busy working on ten other things.
[02:11:44.144 --> 02:11:48.465]  You know, I'm told, oh, this is a nice fella.
[02:11:48.485 --> 02:11:49.825]  You ought to, you know, talk to him.
[02:11:49.905 --> 02:11:51.066]  I'm like, oh, yeah, right.
[02:11:51.086 --> 02:11:53.446]  And I said, just tell the guy I know it's a hit piece, but I'll do it.
[02:11:53.786 --> 02:11:55.147]  You know, I don't shrink from a debate.
[02:11:55.767 --> 02:11:59.048]  By the way, unlike popular mechanics, they've been invited on the show.
[02:11:59.088 --> 02:12:00.068]  I've called in when
[02:12:01.267 --> 02:12:12.017]  Megs, the editor of Popper Mechanics, used to edit the video review TV Guide, he's the expert, was on another show here on the network with Jack Blood, and I called in and said, you won't debate me.
[02:12:12.037 --> 02:12:17.161]  He said, that's right, I won't debate you, because it's no point debating you, you disagree with me.
[02:12:17.702 --> 02:12:21.925]  And I said, well you're with Hearst Publishing, Yellow Journalism, CIA, he didn't rebut that.
[02:12:23.867 --> 02:12:24.968]  So, that's another point.
[02:12:25.188 --> 02:12:28.131]  I will face them on the field, they will not face me on the field.
[02:12:29.893 --> 02:12:34.438]  They will not face me on the field where it's one-on-one and a live debate.
[02:12:34.838 --> 02:12:39.883]  They've got to have it, which by the way, someone who's honest craves a live format.
[02:12:41.104 --> 02:12:45.108]  I love going on CNN a few times I have live, or Good Morning America Live.
[02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:50.614]  Now they delay those even slightly, like ten seconds, but I'm already digressing here.
[02:12:51.502 --> 02:12:58.108]  And we've got big North American Union, SPP Summit news in the next hour with Dr. Corsi and other reporters on the ground.
[02:12:58.208 --> 02:12:59.489]  Quite a few big developments there.
[02:12:59.729 --> 02:13:02.031]  But I've got to walk through all of this right now.
[02:13:04.112 --> 02:13:04.613]  Let me do this.
[02:13:04.633 --> 02:13:08.556]  Let me just state the basic facts as simply as I can and then go back through them.
[02:13:09.537 --> 02:13:11.579]  A popular mechanic lied and said it wasn't a hit piece.
[02:13:11.599 --> 02:13:12.179]  We know it was.
[02:13:13.580 --> 02:13:15.342]  And it was dishonest and it's been debunked.
[02:13:16.242 --> 02:13:20.386]  This guy calls up and I didn't do the searching to check, hey, who owns History Channel?
[02:13:21.229 --> 02:13:23.951]  After I did, after he came to town, I figured out it was a hit piece.
[02:13:24.292 --> 02:13:28.495]  Oh my gosh, Hearst Publishing owns a controlling interest and directs operations.
[02:13:29.536 --> 02:13:33.539]  Okay, because they're a news organization, so they're in the catbird seat.
[02:13:34.079 --> 02:13:38.363]  And they use it for infomercials for their books and other trinkets and things they put out.
[02:13:39.363 --> 02:13:41.085]  So it's a product placement vehicle for them too.
[02:13:42.788 --> 02:13:55.961]  And then I learned this guy is a master hit piece artist who does hit pieces on people and sneaks around in the background, highly respected at NBC, and he did the big famous hit piece where they tricked Michael Jackson to let them follow him around.
[02:13:56.242 --> 02:13:58.304]  He's the one that tricked Michael Jackson to trust him.
[02:13:59.945 --> 02:14:04.470]  And man, when I brought that up to him a few weeks ago, we saw it on the History Channel saying,
[02:14:05.242 --> 02:14:07.563]  You know, these people are basically nuts.
[02:14:07.663 --> 02:14:09.504]  We debunk them.
[02:14:09.544 --> 02:14:11.285]  We disprove them with experts.
[02:14:11.325 --> 02:14:12.866]  I said, that's a Popper Mechanics single.
[02:14:13.166 --> 02:14:14.827]  And by the way, you're owned by Popper Mechanics.
[02:14:14.847 --> 02:14:15.907]  You're owned by Hearst Publishing.
[02:14:17.848 --> 02:14:23.591]  And he said, well, he said, I know that does say that, you know, it's biased.
[02:14:23.611 --> 02:14:25.152]  So I'm having them take that down.
[02:14:25.172 --> 02:14:26.472]  We're working on it right now.
[02:14:26.492 --> 02:14:28.693]  And I said, you know, you did the Michael Jackson hit piece.
[02:14:28.733 --> 02:14:29.774]  And he literally went, huh.
[02:14:31.255 --> 02:14:31.855]  And I went, is that true?
[02:14:31.875 --> 02:14:32.695]  And he goes, yes.
[02:14:32.875 --> 02:14:33.816]  How did you know that?
[02:14:34.577 --> 02:14:38.039]  Literally, he's going, and I know you're listening right now, buddy.
[02:14:38.059 --> 02:14:42.702]  I mean, they think they're just going to assault us?
[02:14:42.742 --> 02:14:43.862]  Because wait until I get into the lies.
[02:14:44.282 --> 02:14:47.144]  You think you're just going to broadside us to tens of millions of people?
[02:14:47.784 --> 02:14:49.105]  Five million in a pop?
[02:14:49.685 --> 02:14:52.087]  Over and over again, and we're not going to fight back?
[02:14:53.407 --> 02:14:54.808]  Wait until I get into what they did!
[02:14:55.028 --> 02:14:57.370]  I've never seen anything like it!
[02:14:59.411 --> 02:14:59.811]  Nothing!
[02:15:00.598 --> 02:15:02.038]  This was the dirtiest pool!
[02:15:02.499 --> 02:15:04.619]  Editing tricks!
[02:15:04.959 --> 02:15:06.740]  It's unbelievable!
[02:15:10.061 --> 02:15:12.221]  This makes Fox News look fair and balanced, folks.
[02:15:12.261 --> 02:15:15.422]  This makes... Here's the analogy.
[02:15:15.482 --> 02:15:19.003]  Fox News is a one-month-old baby that can't swim or even sit up.
[02:15:19.903 --> 02:15:26.845]  And this Brad Davis is an Olympic swimmer who can swim across the English Channel in winter and back.
[02:15:28.126 --> 02:15:29.146]  By the way, nobody can do that.
[02:15:30.345 --> 02:15:33.366]  I mean, that's the level of this.
[02:15:33.426 --> 02:15:39.827]  I mean, that's the separate... I mean, this is... The entire thing was a giant abomination.
[02:15:40.067 --> 02:15:40.548]  And guess what?
[02:15:40.588 --> 02:15:44.949]  They had Lester Holt, NBC Nightly News anchor.
[02:15:45.629 --> 02:15:51.850]  He anchors the weekdays when somebody's on vacation, and he is the weekend anchor for NBC News Saturday and Sunday nights.
[02:15:51.890 --> 02:15:58.292]  I mean, a national broadcast anchor narrates it and is in it attacking us.
[02:16:01.284 --> 02:16:06.085]  And I mean, folks, they make decorative statements how we've been debunked, how it's been disproven.
[02:16:06.365 --> 02:16:09.625]  They, they, they, it is, I have never seen anything like it.
[02:16:13.126 --> 02:16:16.367]  So, A, he lies and says it isn't a hit piece.
[02:16:17.307 --> 02:16:21.868]  And promises and cajoles and says I'm going to show both sides in equal time.
[02:16:27.348 --> 02:16:30.409]  He conceals the fact that he's a hit piece expert.
[02:16:33.795 --> 02:16:35.356]  Now, let's just get into the basics.
[02:16:35.736 --> 02:16:36.277]  Trick edits.
[02:16:37.278 --> 02:16:41.901]  They had the 9-11 Symposium here in Austin and I think it held about 500 people.
[02:16:42.161 --> 02:16:44.843]  When I spoke, 99% of the seats were filled.
[02:16:45.343 --> 02:16:47.545]  I mean, any seats that weren't filled were a few people at the bathroom.
[02:16:47.565 --> 02:16:50.567]  I mean, there might have been one or two seats open, because I've got the video of it.
[02:16:51.267 --> 02:16:52.969]  When I spoke, completely jam-packed.
[02:16:52.989 --> 02:16:53.909]  That was a two-day event.
[02:16:54.590 --> 02:16:57.692]  There were times when they would have hour-long, 30-minute breaks, things like that.
[02:16:59.233 --> 02:17:03.678]  They have kind of third string speakers up there where you might have a hundred people in the stands.
[02:17:04.799 --> 02:17:10.144]  In this show, they show a hundred people in the stands, and then they cut to me.
[02:17:10.624 --> 02:17:11.625]  Total dishonesty.
[02:17:11.665 --> 02:17:12.106]  Trick at it.
[02:17:12.987 --> 02:17:16.490]  Also, they got video.
[02:17:16.690 --> 02:17:17.791]  Well, wait until you hear about this.
[02:17:19.153 --> 02:17:23.437]  I'm just going to go into the messing with the video part first.
[02:17:24.409 --> 02:17:28.951]  And then I'm going to go into all the technical lies, and all the tricks they played, and all the disinfo they put out.
[02:17:29.331 --> 02:17:33.954]  It goes on, and on, and on, and on.
[02:17:34.194 --> 02:17:34.774]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.061 --> 02:17:50.665]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.

[02:18:47.975 --> 02:18:49.136]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:49.516 --> 02:18:51.537]  Here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:18:52.717 --> 02:18:57.560]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:57.740 --> 02:19:00.481]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:19:00.521 --> 02:19:01.642]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:19:02.983 --> 02:19:07.565]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:08.485 --> 02:19:15.749]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:19:16.749 --> 02:19:19.811]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[02:19:20.051 --> 02:19:25.413]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:19:26.394 --> 02:19:27.694]  Call for your copy today.

[02:19:31.196 --> 02:19:37.039]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:19:37.725 --> 02:19:40.186]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:40.266 --> 02:19:41.286]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:41.586 --> 02:19:48.808]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[02:19:49.408 --> 02:19:58.350]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[02:19:58.790 --> 02:20:05.992]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[02:20:06.718 --> 02:20:12.199]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[02:20:45.612 --> 02:20:47.593]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[02:20:47.853 --> 02:20:50.914]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[02:20:51.194 --> 02:20:56.036]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[02:20:56.336 --> 02:20:59.117]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[02:20:59.357 --> 02:21:06.340]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:12.722]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology, and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings.
[02:21:12.722 --> 02:21:13.243]  I think so.
[02:21:30.660 --> 02:21:32.461]  We'll even refund the shipping charge!
[02:21:32.801 --> 02:21:34.402]  Share the oil company's secret!
[02:21:34.542 --> 02:21:35.942]  And get SFR now!
[02:21:36.142 --> 02:21:37.063]  What are you waiting for?
[02:21:37.243 --> 02:21:37.563]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[02:21:37.743 --> 02:21:38.183]  That's 1-888-873-7971.
[02:21:38.203 --> 02:21:38.323]  Today!
[02:21:38.343 --> 02:21:42.185]  The country man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a gold drive.
[02:21:59.594 --> 02:22:27.377]  The interest is up and the stock market's down And you're only getting mugged if you go downtown I live back in the woods, you see A woman and the kids and the dogs and me I got a shotgun, a rifle and a four-wheel drive And a country boy can survive
[02:22:28.610 --> 02:22:32.773]  Country folks can fly.
[02:22:34.154 --> 02:22:39.459]  I can plow a field all day long.
[02:22:39.559 --> 02:22:43.922]  I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn.
[02:22:45.103 --> 02:22:50.708]  We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too.
[02:22:50.828 --> 02:22:53.730]  Ain't too many things these old boys can do.
[02:22:58.379 --> 02:22:59.299]  We're good to go.
[02:23:25.723 --> 02:23:27.644]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:23:27.704 --> 02:23:31.467]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:23:31.507 --> 02:23:36.050]  That's right, Hurst Publishing and you carpet-bagging New World Order types.
[02:23:36.090 --> 02:23:41.013]  We're going to be around a long time after your propaganda has been debunked.
[02:23:42.334 --> 02:23:44.676]  We're going to be here years from now exposing you.
[02:23:45.336 --> 02:23:50.420]  When somebody Googles the name Brad Davis, they're going to find out what a big fat snake you are, boy.
[02:23:52.788 --> 02:23:55.510]  We're more than happy for you to assault us and lie about us.
[02:23:57.852 --> 02:23:59.714]  That's why you've been exposed.
[02:23:59.754 --> 02:24:01.475]  That's why the mainstream media is plunging.
[02:24:01.515 --> 02:24:02.817]  That's why you have no credit.
[02:24:05.138 --> 02:24:06.700]  Nobody trusts you anymore.
[02:24:08.241 --> 02:24:16.208]  It's the same thing with your great granddaddy, the founder of Hearst Publishing, that cold baron, robber baron, William Randolph Hearst.
[02:24:17.529 --> 02:24:21.251]  That's why all of your publishing arms, all of it, are a big joke.
[02:24:21.291 --> 02:24:23.933]  And we're going to tell everybody about it.
[02:24:24.594 --> 02:24:26.495]  As if you weren't already mistrusted.
[02:24:26.575 --> 02:24:30.277]  As if Fox News wasn't already anathema and a joke.
[02:24:30.778 --> 02:24:33.279]  Well, you're an even bigger joke, Hearst Publishing.
[02:24:34.860 --> 02:24:37.082]  And the History Channel and A&E and all of it.
[02:24:40.744 --> 02:24:41.845]  Let me just run down through it.
[02:24:42.125 --> 02:24:46.708]  Alright, they do stuff like trick edits where they would show me giving a speech.
[02:24:47.811 --> 02:24:50.333]  And they wouldn't show the crowd when it was completely jam-packed.
[02:24:50.353 --> 02:24:52.595]  They'd show when it was during a bathroom break.
[02:24:53.016 --> 02:24:54.457]  A 10, 20 minute, 30 minute break.
[02:24:54.777 --> 02:24:56.339]  They had some hour-long breaks for lunch.
[02:24:56.759 --> 02:24:58.100]  They'd just show it when it's on break.
[02:24:58.501 --> 02:25:03.325]  And then even zoom in for like 10 seconds on empty chairs while myself and others are speaking.
[02:25:03.886 --> 02:25:05.247]  Like, oh look, they don't have any people.
[02:25:06.383 --> 02:25:11.324]  I saw Dylan Avery on the video of Luce Chains and he suddenly looked like he'd gained about 8 million pounds.
[02:25:12.945 --> 02:25:26.188]  And again, I've been on all these TV shows, I've been in these newspieces, I've made 16 films, I know what it looks like with the Avid system or with whatever other system, it looks like Avid editing that they used.
[02:25:26.828 --> 02:25:31.029]  They took the video of Dylan Avery and they blew it up.
[02:25:32.344 --> 02:25:34.185]  And they blew it up where he looks like Frankenstein.
[02:25:34.205 --> 02:25:35.325]  It's a close-up of his face.
[02:25:35.645 --> 02:25:37.646]  And then they stretched the video.
[02:25:39.186 --> 02:25:42.327]  I mean, you could take a bean pole and make him look like they weigh 800 pounds.
[02:25:42.687 --> 02:25:44.608]  And it's a really disconcerting look.
[02:25:44.788 --> 02:25:51.130]  I mean, it makes it, you know, the person be irritating to look at because it's like a funhouse look.
[02:25:51.390 --> 02:25:53.831]  They stretched his face out.
[02:25:54.551 --> 02:25:56.992]  And then made it look real creamy white.
[02:25:58.472 --> 02:26:00.713]  And then with me, they put a, uh,
[02:26:01.707 --> 02:26:06.530]  Liver failure look, you know, when you got hepatitis, that real yellow look.
[02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:08.131]  And my wife goes, that doesn't look like you.
[02:26:08.691 --> 02:26:09.891]  And I said, look at the stretching.
[02:26:10.712 --> 02:26:14.034]  And with me, they went into the video and they stretched it out.
[02:26:14.394 --> 02:26:21.278]  And then there's this part with video of people at Ground Zero on the 5th anniversary.
[02:26:22.058 --> 02:26:23.679]  And folks, that's our video.
[02:26:23.739 --> 02:26:25.140]  That's from Terror Storm.
[02:26:25.340 --> 02:26:25.720]  I know it.
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:26.881]  It's shot high def.
[02:26:27.521 --> 02:26:28.662]  They took that video.
[02:26:29.942 --> 02:26:31.203]  It's from Terror Storm 2nd Edition.
[02:26:31.872 --> 02:26:39.461]  Crystal clear and they blew it up to make okay and they and they took a clip from it where the crowd looks like 10 people not 2,000.
[02:26:39.521 --> 02:26:44.566]  That's a conservative folks are saying 3,000 it wasn't 3,000 it was 2,000 and they blow it up and then they
[02:26:50.376 --> 02:27:02.605]  Just turn the blacks all the way up till it looks like blown out 1970s VHS or something and have my head glowing red and then just hammered video and hammered audio.
[02:27:04.326 --> 02:27:10.451]  So, I mean, every trick in the book, they started with, this is Alex Jones, bleh, red face.
[02:27:10.551 --> 02:27:14.834]  I mean, so, so, so that's just the visuals and it went on and on.
[02:27:14.874 --> 02:27:17.056]  My mouth was hanging open during this.
[02:27:17.756 --> 02:27:19.698]  Because I know what they did with these computers.
[02:27:21.918 --> 02:27:36.110]  And then they would cut the popular mechanics, glistening marble, stainless steel makeup, double-breasted $5,000 suits, and compare that to blown-out, ripped video, glowing yellow heads!
[02:27:36.330 --> 02:27:37.231]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.731 --> 02:27:39.333]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.253 --> 02:27:42.936]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.545 --> 02:27:48.386]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:27:48.526 --> 02:27:53.708]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:27:53.888 --> 02:27:55.229]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:27:55.489 --> 02:28:03.672]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:28:03.892 --> 02:28:09.615]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:28:09.795 --> 02:28:11.556]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:28:11.636 --> 02:28:13.778]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:28:13.938 --> 02:28:18.181]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:28:18.361 --> 02:28:20.502]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:28:20.582 --> 02:28:27.927]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:28:29.434 --> 02:28:30.035]  We're good.
[02:28:46.091 --> 02:28:46.511]  Attention!
[02:28:46.651 --> 02:28:48.612]  This is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[02:28:48.812 --> 02:28:53.074]  Honeybees are now mysteriously vanishing at an astonishing pace across the entire country.
[02:28:53.234 --> 02:28:56.155]  Why is this urgent message about honeybees so desperately important?
[02:28:56.395 --> 02:28:57.335]  The answer is easy.
[02:28:57.475 --> 02:29:03.697]  You see, honeybees produce a unique compound, fed only to the queen, that makes her live six times longer than other bees in the hive.
[02:29:03.918 --> 02:29:07.959]  Some researchers now believe the compound may have miraculous effects on humans as well.
[02:29:08.139 --> 02:29:10.640]  The compound is called Royal Jelly and is now available
[02:29:10.660 --> 02:29:10.980]  I think so.
[02:29:29.065 --> 02:29:29.806]  We're good to go.
[02:29:46.107 --> 02:29:50.371]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:29:50.631 --> 02:29:55.475]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:29:55.736 --> 02:29:57.057]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:29:57.237 --> 02:30:00.740]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:30:12.350 --> 02:30:14.772]  Now, CalBin soaps are available to you and me.

[02:30:21.017 --> 02:30:21.958]  No animal testing.
[02:30:22.218 --> 02:30:23.539]  I use them and love them.
[02:30:23.559 --> 02:30:25.141]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:30:25.421 --> 02:30:26.562]  And I say it big time.
[02:30:26.842 --> 02:30:28.443]  Call CalBin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:30:28.563 --> 02:30:28.904]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[02:30:38.311 --> 02:30:44.873]  Again, that number 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:30:46.134 --> 02:31:02.339]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving.
[02:31:02.719 --> 02:31:06.161]  I won't even turn my head.
[02:31:08.659 --> 02:31:12.722]  Don't send your kin folks to give me no talkin'.
[02:31:14.263 --> 02:31:16.484]  I'll be gone like I said.
[02:31:19.086 --> 02:31:24.049]  You'd say the same old thing that you've been sayin' all along.
[02:31:24.089 --> 02:31:28.311]  Lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[02:31:28.371 --> 02:31:33.314]  Don't give me that old familiar cryin' cussin' mawn.
[02:31:35.016 --> 02:31:36.517]  Understand your man.
[02:31:36.697 --> 02:31:40.440]  I'm tired of your bad mouth.
[02:31:40.500 --> 02:31:42.642]  Understand your man.
[02:31:49.128 --> 02:31:52.010]  Come on, let's hear one more verse.
[02:32:11.105 --> 02:32:34.954]  You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army And everything else I leave behind
[02:32:37.417 --> 02:33:01.980]  I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin' While I'm untangled in my mind I ain't gonna repeat what I said anymore While I'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before I'll be as gone as a wild goose in winter
[02:33:03.241 --> 02:33:07.805]  I'll tell you, I just love that song.
[02:33:09.927 --> 02:33:15.031]  Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[02:33:15.611 --> 02:33:20.075]  Oh, man.
[02:33:21.196 --> 02:33:22.197]  Welcome back, folks.
[02:33:22.697 --> 02:33:23.318]  More shocks.
[02:33:23.598 --> 02:33:30.924]  I've been told that John Gibson on the national radio show of the, I call him the albino vampire of Fox News,
[02:33:31.995 --> 02:33:35.838]  He is, he is attacking me on a daily basis, I've been told.
[02:33:35.858 --> 02:33:36.539]  I haven't heard it.
[02:33:36.959 --> 02:33:41.943]  Now, during the break, it was on YouTube, him attacking me and playing clips of me getting upset and mad.
[02:33:43.284 --> 02:34:01.558]  To have Popper Mechanics, because I'm the supposed demon leader in all this, in the program, and to have him attacking me in nail boards, and... You gotta know I'm under surveillance, and you gotta know that they're really getting worried about me, and, uh, because I'm reaching a lot of people, and they think they can just destroy my name, and that'll slow us down, and it won't!
[02:34:02.389 --> 02:34:03.750]  Because I've never made this about me.
[02:34:04.310 --> 02:34:07.973]  I've just tried to wake up as many people as I can, as fast as I can, with the truth.
[02:34:09.574 --> 02:34:19.401]  But it is a little bit daunting sometimes to just know these people are evil, they know what they're a part of, and to understand they've made the decision to be evil because they think they're on the winning side.
[02:34:20.342 --> 02:34:22.023]  And it's just disgusting.
[02:34:22.083 --> 02:34:23.264]  It's depressing is what it is.
[02:34:23.324 --> 02:34:25.005]  I'm not even afraid of them.
[02:34:25.365 --> 02:34:27.387]  Let me walk through the rest of the hit piece.
[02:34:27.407 --> 02:34:31.930]  It'll be up on PrisonPlanet.com in the next hour, detailed by Paul Watson.
[02:34:34.469 --> 02:34:37.892]  Everything I'm telling you now, I've told him and written for him and he's putting it all together.
[02:34:37.952 --> 02:34:41.375]  This is a very important article that is coming up.
[02:34:41.795 --> 02:34:44.397]  So start your engines and get ready to dig it to the front page.
[02:34:44.818 --> 02:34:46.679]  Try to go over there Barry Brigade.
[02:34:47.099 --> 02:34:51.643]  Try to get past their censors and just ram it through the whole lab.
[02:34:51.863 --> 02:34:57.588]  And I think we're going to be next week giving up the number of Hearst Publishing and History Channel and just giving them another dose of their own medicine.
[02:35:01.405 --> 02:35:06.567]  All right, and I've also noticed the COINTELPRO outfits all attacking me in unison now.
[02:35:07.928 --> 02:35:12.210]  I mean, I am just under massive attack, and it's good.
[02:35:12.230 --> 02:35:17.652]  I mean, I'm really actually pleased to be knowing we're having this big of an effect.
[02:35:17.712 --> 02:35:21.474]  I mean, we're definitely over main targets, and we're getting this much flack shot up at us.
[02:35:22.214 --> 02:35:26.176]  My only concern is that I'd like my own personal life a little bit.
[02:35:27.168 --> 02:35:28.729]  Selah V as they say.
[02:35:28.809 --> 02:35:54.780]  I've got to persevere and as I said I passed the point of return a long time ago and it is in God's hands Yahweh Jesus Jehovah hey we're talking about the man upstairs folks we all know who we're talking about and that's that's who I put all my faith in and just ask God to help me be a good vessel in all of this and to do his will that's all I try to do is follow the will of God all right so
[02:35:56.585 --> 02:35:58.686]  I was watching the video.
[02:35:59.527 --> 02:36:16.217]  They were cutting the foreheads off and blowing and stretching the video up and manipulating the color levels and the brightness and sharpness levels on Jason Bermas, on Dylan Avery, on Cory Rubb.
[02:36:18.538 --> 02:36:19.839]  They did it to me real bad.
[02:36:19.879 --> 02:36:24.822]  They did real unflattering shots from down at the floor, like up at my belly while I was in the radio studio.
[02:36:27.049 --> 02:36:35.611]  They would, at Ground Zero and other places, only show two or three people, or they would show video of the end of a line of people and show like two or three people in black shirts.
[02:36:36.111 --> 02:36:39.291]  They would also show people at Ground Zero yelling and screaming.
[02:36:39.311 --> 02:36:42.392]  There had been an argument, but just the person on the other side.
[02:36:42.412 --> 02:36:51.614]  They also showed a video from like three years ago of an interesting individual who's like an auxiliary fireman.
[02:36:52.862 --> 02:36:59.306]  He claims kind of like a, it's like a, and he would show up and yell at people and they say, oh, see the firemen are mad, but isn't even a fireman.
[02:36:59.846 --> 02:37:03.308]  And they showed like two, three year old footage of loose change, which said it was just a few months ago.
[02:37:03.328 --> 02:37:05.649]  Uh, that was a mistake they made.
[02:37:05.809 --> 02:37:06.790]  I'm sure it was on purpose.
[02:37:08.130 --> 02:37:09.811]  It was off loose changes, own extras.
[02:37:10.452 --> 02:37:11.452]  That's how they even had it.
[02:37:12.933 --> 02:37:19.897]  Um, and it just went on and on and on and on.
[02:37:22.851 --> 02:37:33.374]  They would also do things like call James Meggs, who was the editor of a video rental review magazine.
[02:37:37.156 --> 02:37:43.218]  I mean, they would call him an expert, and they would show Professor Jones would say one line.
[02:37:44.338 --> 02:37:50.300]  And they would show one hesitant line, like part of a sentence cut out where it made no sense, and then they'd cut to
[02:37:52.023 --> 02:37:52.944]  The quote, expert.
[02:37:53.024 --> 02:37:54.305]  And it would say, expert.
[02:37:54.746 --> 02:37:57.288]  The expert responds, it's false, it's debunked.
[02:37:57.568 --> 02:37:58.890]  And the expert would be James Maggs.
[02:37:59.610 --> 02:38:01.933]  Just sitting there going, he's the expert!
[02:38:02.393 --> 02:38:04.075]  Editor of Popular Mechanics, yellow journalist.
[02:38:04.996 --> 02:38:07.358]  He would just say, oh it's not true, this is why it happened.
[02:38:08.763 --> 02:38:19.911]  And it was all like, how sad we are, and how pathetic we are, and how delusional we are, and how we're afraid of Al Qaeda, so we want to say it's the government, because that brings some order and closure to it.
[02:38:19.991 --> 02:38:23.133]  No, it doesn't bring closure to it, thinking there's criminals running our government.
[02:38:23.153 --> 02:38:25.014]  Believe me, I wish it was some people in a cave.
[02:38:26.415 --> 02:38:30.498]  And, and... So they pull that out.
[02:38:30.618 --> 02:38:32.840]  And I've got all these notes here.
[02:38:34.429 --> 02:38:36.651]  They would also show the authors of the U.S.
[02:38:36.691 --> 02:38:44.576]  government reports, who it turns out are on defense contractor payrolls, themselves have all been individually debunked.
[02:38:44.656 --> 02:38:48.258]  They claim that NIST says fuel oil tanks brought it down.
[02:38:48.278 --> 02:38:50.220]  NIST says they didn't.
[02:38:51.781 --> 02:38:55.803]  They then claim that NIST says the building fell into it, made it come down.
[02:38:56.104 --> 02:38:57.064]  That's been withdrawn.
[02:38:57.084 --> 02:39:00.787]  It was incredible!
[02:39:00.867 --> 02:39:02.348]  I mean, I can't even describe
[02:39:03.596 --> 02:39:23.812]  Oh, and then they've got one of the Popper Mechanics hacks up there saying that they've got David Ray Griffin on there reporting that some of the, and he's neurotic about documenting everything, that some of the phone calls were made from cell phones, not air phones, from above 40,000 feet.
[02:39:23.832 --> 02:39:24.533]  That's impossible!
[02:39:25.126 --> 02:39:31.008]  And they just have one of the popper mechanics guys, looks like he's about 15 years old in a fancy suit, says, well that's not true.
[02:39:31.628 --> 02:39:36.210]  Phones work, and they have Megs echo it, phones work from 50,000 feet.
[02:39:37.270 --> 02:39:40.691]  At that time, they say, quote, at that time, phones worked at 50,000 feet.
[02:39:41.231 --> 02:39:46.633]  Well, they just announced last year they want to try to make them work to 20,000, and that's going to take special cell phones you buy.
[02:39:46.653 --> 02:39:48.694]  They're not even sure it'll work.
[02:39:49.134 --> 02:39:51.555]  I mean, your cell phone won't even work in your own house half the time.
[02:39:52.135 --> 02:39:54.476]  I have done it over and over again on takeoff and landing.
[02:39:55.854 --> 02:39:57.475]  I've never gotten above 2,000 feet.
[02:39:57.836 --> 02:39:58.356]  How do I know?
[02:39:58.396 --> 02:40:03.920]  There are 2,000 foot radio towers a few miles from the airport, and I can look and see one in parallel with them.
[02:40:05.421 --> 02:40:11.945]  There's some mega towers around here, and you'll be at the same level of the tower, and that cell phone went out when you were at 1,000 feet, and now you're at 2,000.
[02:40:12.066 --> 02:40:20.251]  Oh, you know, you call your wife, you call your friends, okay, I'm going to see how long this phone stays connected, okay, and then you just set it in your lap so the stewardess doesn't see, and whoop!
[02:40:21.792 --> 02:40:23.574]  Once you're at 2,000 feet, you go, hello baby, hello, you there?
[02:40:24.134 --> 02:40:25.275]  Or, hey Bob, you there?
[02:40:26.164 --> 02:40:27.505]  Whoever you're calling, and it's gone.
[02:40:27.525 --> 02:40:28.145]  It's disconnected.
[02:40:29.005 --> 02:40:31.467]  Oh no, they work at 50,000 now!
[02:40:31.767 --> 02:40:32.847]  No facts, no documents.
[02:40:32.887 --> 02:40:34.568]  I mean, they just say, expert analysis.
[02:40:35.349 --> 02:40:36.849]  In big black screen, white letters.
[02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:39.851]  And then it cuts to them and they say, oh, phones work at 50,000 feet.
[02:40:40.671 --> 02:40:41.112]  At that time.
[02:40:41.592 --> 02:40:42.132]  Boom, done.
[02:40:42.352 --> 02:40:43.253]  Doesn't matter they don't work at 2,000.
[02:40:45.134 --> 02:40:45.674]  Doesn't matter.
[02:40:45.774 --> 02:40:46.574]  Boom, they work it.
[02:40:46.774 --> 02:40:51.677]  And then they said, well, out of 40 plus phone calls, only two were from cell phones anyways.
[02:40:52.538 --> 02:40:53.618]  It's the reverse of that.
[02:40:53.658 --> 02:40:57.119]  A minority of the calls, and that's in the news, were from air phones.
[02:40:58.859 --> 02:41:02.860]  The AT&T records, the records that are out there, the phone records are public.
[02:41:02.900 --> 02:41:04.980]  It was their personal cell phones calling.
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:09.141]  Because people said, hey, those are fake calls.
[02:41:11.481 --> 02:41:16.802]  And because they say they're fake calls, they went and said, no, no, look, we have the phone records.
[02:41:16.842 --> 02:41:17.963]  It was their cell phones.
[02:41:18.023 --> 02:41:18.323]  See?
[02:41:18.603 --> 02:41:20.343]  Their personal cell phones.
[02:41:23.264 --> 02:41:28.629]  And Professor Jones, I've talked to him about the show even before it aired.
[02:41:29.029 --> 02:41:30.710]  All he talked about was Thermate.
[02:41:31.571 --> 02:41:34.694]  All he talked about was these little iron balls.
[02:41:35.154 --> 02:41:36.495]  All he talked about was the samples.
[02:41:36.895 --> 02:41:38.897]  All he talked about was the video of the metal pouring out.
[02:41:39.337 --> 02:41:43.041]  They literally had like four clips of him for ten seconds a piece saying nothing.
[02:41:43.721 --> 02:41:44.682]  It's the same thing with me.
[02:41:45.523 --> 02:41:50.827]  They just edited and edited and edited to where I'm basically saying nothing.
[02:41:55.831 --> 02:42:00.732]  Also, I gave like an hour speech and only ranted and raved right at the end, and of course that was the part they put in the film.
[02:42:02.012 --> 02:42:05.053]  But the biggest thing they do, there's two things.
[02:42:05.313 --> 02:42:06.093]  Here are the big ones.
[02:42:07.054 --> 02:42:09.494]  There's about literally 50 other notes.
[02:42:09.514 --> 02:42:16.656]  I mean, I've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 pages of handwritten notes.
[02:42:16.676 --> 02:42:19.277]  Okay?
[02:42:19.297 --> 02:42:20.357]  10 pages of these.
[02:42:20.417 --> 02:42:21.857]  I've covered maybe one page.
[02:42:23.478 --> 02:42:25.238]  But let me tell you the worst things they did.
[02:42:27.785 --> 02:42:43.751]  You've seen at the end of Braveheart, true story, where Longshanks is having the drawn and quartered, the guts torn out of William Wallace, played by Mel Gibson, to recant his rebellion and just call for mercy and say he's guilty.
[02:42:44.572 --> 02:42:48.193]  And they'll chop his head off and let him get out of pain instead of burning his entrails in front of him.
[02:42:49.033 --> 02:42:55.596]  They take your guts out and wheel them around a stick and then burn them in front of you in medieval type torture.
[02:42:56.545 --> 02:43:00.966]  That's how Wallace went down and they stuck his head on the London Bridge.
[02:43:01.126 --> 02:43:01.646]  I've been there.
[02:43:01.686 --> 02:43:02.986]  British are real proud of it.
[02:43:03.006 --> 02:43:04.727]  The government's got a huge spike there.
[02:43:05.007 --> 02:43:13.989]  And they brag and talk garbage about him at the... I've taken two different tours there and they just brag about the enemy and how he was killed and how good Benedict Arnold was.
[02:43:14.069 --> 02:43:15.149]  It's just disgusting.
[02:43:15.429 --> 02:43:17.190]  But anyways, I'm digressing.
[02:43:17.230 --> 02:43:22.931]  The point is, is they whisper over him, say, mercy, admit your guilty.
[02:43:24.591 --> 02:43:26.653]  And this is what I've seen Fox News and others do.
[02:43:26.693 --> 02:43:30.356]  They will claim we've recanted when we haven't recanted.
[02:43:31.978 --> 02:43:37.022]  Like, I told the Loose Change guys, you know, because they were taking a long time getting the film done, which is fine, I told them to take their time.
[02:43:37.042 --> 02:43:40.065]  You know, Charlie Sheen had said he'd narrate it after he saw it.
[02:43:40.905 --> 02:43:44.409]  So the press spun that and said, Charlie Sheen's not doing it anymore.
[02:43:46.130 --> 02:43:48.232]  No, Charlie said, yeah, I'm probably gonna do it.
[02:43:48.252 --> 02:43:49.673]  I gotta shine on to it.
[02:43:49.693 --> 02:43:51.455]  You know, I gotta see it first.
[02:43:54.252 --> 02:43:56.954]  Well, they took that and Fox News, Charlie Sheen backs out.
[02:43:56.974 --> 02:43:58.835]  Charlie Sheen has recanted.
[02:43:58.855 --> 02:43:59.335]  They said that.
[02:43:59.596 --> 02:44:01.917]  Charlie Sheen doesn't believe in 9-11 truth anymore.
[02:44:02.257 --> 02:44:03.698]  Hundreds of news articles were written.
[02:44:03.918 --> 02:44:06.120]  Charlie Sheen's backed off and admitted he was wrong.
[02:44:06.140 --> 02:44:07.701]  Totally made up!
[02:44:08.521 --> 02:44:10.383]  That's what this piece did last night.
[02:44:13.645 --> 02:44:18.208]  They were around Dylan and Corey and Jason for days in L.A.
[02:44:18.228 --> 02:44:19.889]  when they were out there and days at their home.
[02:44:23.143 --> 02:44:27.344]  By the way, they brought cops, they brought, you know, victims there, trying to get them to be interviewed.
[02:44:27.445 --> 02:44:30.205]  No, they didn't want to talk to them.
[02:44:30.225 --> 02:44:32.526]  The BBC didn't want to talk to them when they were there doing a hit piece.
[02:44:33.427 --> 02:44:34.167]  We'll get to that later.
[02:44:34.207 --> 02:44:34.827]  That's the next thing.
[02:44:37.928 --> 02:44:39.329]  And this guy convinced them, folks.
[02:44:39.369 --> 02:44:40.709]  He told them, oh, I'm your friend.
[02:44:40.789 --> 02:44:41.949]  Oh, no, this is a fair piece.
[02:44:42.510 --> 02:44:45.611]  And remember a few weeks ago, I was arguing with the one on there.
[02:44:45.631 --> 02:44:46.691]  I was like, dude, it's a hit piece.
[02:44:48.612 --> 02:44:50.833]  I mean, tell you, Brad Davis would lie right to your face.
[02:44:50.853 --> 02:44:51.993]  You've got to learn how they are.
[02:44:52.688 --> 02:44:53.989]  I mean, I had to learn this years ago.
[02:44:54.589 --> 02:44:56.171]  When I was 24, I had to believe his lies.
[02:44:56.651 --> 02:44:58.332]  Because he just, oh, I promise it's a fair piece.
[02:44:58.372 --> 02:45:00.694]  No, no, we want to know about your movement and who you are.
[02:45:01.114 --> 02:45:02.075]  This is a phenomenon.
[02:45:02.115 --> 02:45:03.716]  No, no, no, we'll have people on the other side.
[02:45:03.736 --> 02:45:06.017]  But no, no, this is not an attack piece.
[02:45:06.158 --> 02:45:07.138]  Oh, no, we promise.
[02:45:08.359 --> 02:45:10.381]  See, that's how bad his lying was.
[02:45:10.901 --> 02:45:15.204]  I mean, he fooled Michael Jackson, folks, into letting him in.
[02:45:16.205 --> 02:45:17.085]  This guy's a snake!
[02:45:20.167 --> 02:45:22.149]  And I only bring that up to illustrate the deception.
[02:45:23.448 --> 02:45:29.231]  And so in the piece, they say that Dylan and them have recanted controlled demolitions in Tower 1 and 2.
[02:45:29.671 --> 02:45:36.274]  Now all they really said, as I've heard them say it on their own show and here on this show, is, well, we focused on controlled demolitions mainly in the last film.
[02:45:36.514 --> 02:45:40.856]  We're still going to cover that, but we can prove it's a demolition, but then they can argue and debate all day.
[02:45:41.077 --> 02:45:43.158]  What we're going to focus in on is how the hijackers were U.S.
[02:45:43.198 --> 02:45:44.658]  government agents, trained at U.S.
[02:45:44.678 --> 02:45:46.839]  military bases, Mohammed Atta getting $100,000 from
[02:45:48.740 --> 02:45:51.961]  General Mahmoud Ahmed, the head of Pakistani intelligence and the U.S.
[02:45:51.981 --> 02:45:57.342]  troops, Mass in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and the 9-11 drills, because people don't know about that.
[02:46:00.002 --> 02:46:01.622]  Which I think is smart to do.
[02:46:04.143 --> 02:46:14.825]  Well, they just took Dylan and Corey and them out of context and strung three sentences with the three of them, going, yeah, well, you know, we focused on that in the last show, now we're going to focus on other things.
[02:46:15.896 --> 02:46:25.544]  Cut it into another one of the three saying, well, you know, we just cover a lot of the views and ideas out there in the first film or in the second edition.
[02:46:25.985 --> 02:46:27.366]  Now we're really honing it down.
[02:46:28.107 --> 02:46:29.027]  But see, they cut that.
[02:46:29.087 --> 02:46:30.088]  They cut the end off that.
[02:46:30.108 --> 02:46:33.711]  And then they stuck it with somebody else saying, yeah, yeah, we're not doing that now.
[02:46:34.052 --> 02:46:35.893]  And they made it look like they said we were wrong.
[02:46:35.913 --> 02:46:40.878]  And then they say, they admit they were wrong, but others still don't.
[02:46:41.418 --> 02:46:42.339]  And it cuts to me.
[02:46:43.456 --> 02:46:45.017]  Horrible side angle shot.
[02:46:45.518 --> 02:46:46.078]  Yelling.
[02:46:47.939 --> 02:46:48.520]  Blown out.
[02:46:48.620 --> 02:46:49.140]  Blown up.
[02:46:49.180 --> 02:46:50.862]  Deformed, stretched video.
[02:46:52.463 --> 02:46:53.644]  I saw the cameras they were using.
[02:46:53.684 --> 02:46:54.404]  I know what they did.
[02:46:55.946 --> 02:46:57.507]  And they cut right into me.
[02:47:00.929 --> 02:47:02.150]  They cut right into me.
[02:47:05.333 --> 02:47:05.513]  See?
[02:47:05.813 --> 02:47:06.874]  Oh, it's been disproven.
[02:47:06.914 --> 02:47:09.416]  It's been... And then you hear Lester Holt.
[02:47:09.476 --> 02:47:11.117]  The NBC anchor.
[02:47:11.257 --> 02:47:12.078]  National anchor.
[02:47:12.990 --> 02:47:13.911]  Oh, so trusted!
[02:47:14.611 --> 02:47:18.613]  Sit up there and go, now that they've been debunked, they still don't stop.
[02:47:18.974 --> 02:47:20.434]  Because it's a cult religion.
[02:47:22.556 --> 02:47:24.076]  And it went on and on and on.
[02:47:26.518 --> 02:47:29.379]  Then they say the firemen and police hate us, that we bring up the pain.
[02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:30.960]  They say the families hate us.
[02:47:32.341 --> 02:47:35.403]  They cut to this individual.
[02:47:38.999 --> 02:47:43.122]  And then they cut to this one woman saying, Every time they bring it up, it makes me think of losing my family member.
[02:47:43.462 --> 02:47:44.363]  It makes... I hate them!
[02:47:44.583 --> 02:47:48.926]  And then it cuts to the popular mechanic's young punk, Mr. Corbin.
[02:47:49.466 --> 02:47:51.368]  And he goes, This is the part that makes me sick.
[02:47:51.408 --> 02:47:53.149]  As a journalist, I try to not get emotional.
[02:47:53.389 --> 02:47:54.870]  But these people are despicable!
[02:47:54.890 --> 02:47:55.971]  And it cuts back to me.
[02:47:57.117 --> 02:47:57.638]  Oh yeah!
[02:47:57.998 --> 02:47:59.159]  I gave them the names.
[02:47:59.259 --> 02:48:11.647]  I gave them dozens of phone numbers to victims' families and Bill Doyle, the head of the biggest group, 7,000 plus members, admitted biggest group, who says the majority of their members think inside job and he thinks it too.
[02:48:12.087 --> 02:48:13.067]  Lost his son Joey.
[02:48:14.668 --> 02:48:16.129]  I remember him going, what do you think about the families?
[02:48:16.149 --> 02:48:16.830]  Saw him get mad.
[02:48:16.850 --> 02:48:18.251]  And I went, really?
[02:48:18.271 --> 02:48:21.413]  The majority agree with us.
[02:48:22.173 --> 02:48:24.735]  And wanted another investigation and say that it's an inside job.
[02:48:25.766 --> 02:48:26.446]  None of that in there.
[02:48:26.806 --> 02:48:29.687]  Just, the families hate the 9-11 truthers.
[02:48:30.287 --> 02:48:36.429]  See, that's the most despicable thing is you set them against us and demonize us to a national audience.
[02:48:36.989 --> 02:48:39.710]  And that's where you defamed me.
[02:48:40.210 --> 02:48:42.551]  That's where you're in big trouble.
[02:48:49.287 --> 02:48:54.729]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:55.110 --> 02:49:02.753]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.433 --> 02:49:10.496]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.896 --> 02:49:22.321]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.621 --> 02:49:26.123]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.583 --> 02:49:28.504]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.844 --> 02:49:32.626]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:46.016 --> 02:49:49.037]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:49:49.358 --> 02:49:54.280]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:54.540 --> 02:49:58.882]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:59.182 --> 02:50:08.106]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:50:08.306 --> 02:50:11.928]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:50:12.208 --> 02:50:17.252]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:50:17.532 --> 02:50:24.237]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:50:24.750 --> 02:50:25.411]  What about you?
[02:50:26.051 --> 02:50:31.415]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:50:46.354 --> 02:50:48.135]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:50:48.235 --> 02:50:49.495]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:50:49.715 --> 02:50:52.556]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:50:52.916 --> 02:50:55.677]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:50:56.218 --> 02:51:02.940]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:51:48.254 --> 02:51:53.356]  We've got Michael Medved attacking me yesterday for whole segments.
[02:51:53.496 --> 02:51:55.757]  We've got John Gibson attacking me for whole segments.
[02:51:56.377 --> 02:51:58.978]  Other reports pouring in of how I'm being attacked.
[02:51:59.338 --> 02:52:02.659]  Again, they get talking points memos, ladies and gentlemen, many of these guys.
[02:52:04.380 --> 02:52:06.220]  And they're going after me something fierce.
[02:52:06.320 --> 02:52:07.641]  I have really made them mad.
[02:52:08.605 --> 02:52:15.267]  And the History Channel is hitting on all cylinders with the most slickly packaged, because it's so multivariate.
[02:52:15.287 --> 02:52:36.495]  I mean, from blowing out the video, to sneaky edits, to claiming the families all hate us, and literally having people cry, and you know, now I'm like the devil, I'm making them cry, and Dylan Avery and them have recanted, and when they didn't recant, so they literally edited it to where like, they made a mistake, and they're bad, and they admit they were wrong.
[02:52:37.731 --> 02:52:44.514]  And they've backed off, and lying to get the interview and saying it wasn't a hit piece, and then all the technical stuff.
[02:52:45.315 --> 02:53:01.282]  I mean, I've got page after page after page right here of just the technical lies, and we're going to mention some of those in the new article that's coming out on PrisonPlanet.com, but it's going to be the next article
[02:53:02.322 --> 02:53:12.208]  The next story that Paul does in the next few days, as he himself and others have time to analyze, it's a two-hour program, a lot to digest, but my mouth was hanging open.
[02:53:12.248 --> 02:53:14.089]  I mean, it was all lies.
[02:53:14.649 --> 02:53:18.251]  Cell phones work at 50,000 feet in 2001?
[02:53:18.592 --> 02:53:25.776]  I mean, that is just... They say, Popular Mechanic says, well everybody knows cell phones work at 50,000 feet, it's documented.
[02:53:28.527 --> 02:53:34.172]  Now, I'm not talking about the article that Paul wrote that says viewers see History Channel 9-11 piece as straw man hit piece.
[02:53:34.192 --> 02:53:38.735]  He just took your comments and quotes and what Steven Jones said and other things put together.
[02:53:38.996 --> 02:53:39.936]  That's an important story.
[02:53:40.297 --> 02:53:50.945]  But the one that's coming out next hour, that is the important one that you've got to get out to everybody.
[02:53:51.125 --> 02:53:55.389]  Because we are just... Listen, five million saw this last night.
[02:53:56.241 --> 02:53:59.602]  About 2 million will see it tonight when they air it later in the evening.
[02:53:59.962 --> 02:54:03.043]  When it airs Saturday, another 5 million.
[02:54:03.063 --> 02:54:06.724]  They go above 5 million many Saturdays on History Channel.
[02:54:06.944 --> 02:54:07.684]  I pulled their numbers.
[02:54:08.164 --> 02:54:10.125]  Then they're going to air it again two more times after that.
[02:54:10.145 --> 02:54:14.186]  I mean just over and over and over again.
[02:54:14.206 --> 02:54:18.247]  5 million each prime time viewing, a couple mil each off prime time.
[02:54:19.073 --> 02:54:27.737]  And these people just sit there on their backs, these are the TV heads, and they see women crying about their dead son, and I'm the one that did it, I'm the one that makes her cry.
[02:54:27.757 --> 02:54:48.466]  And then you realize this is being produced and run by NBC, owned by General Electric, that makes the bombs and the weapons and the spy systems, and by Hearst Publishing, and by the way, there were sleeping pill ads, serotonin reuptake inhibitor ads, there were Marine Corps ads throughout the piece,
[02:54:49.352 --> 02:54:50.573]  I don't normally see this many.
[02:54:50.613 --> 02:54:52.093]  This is like specially produced.
[02:54:52.133 --> 02:54:54.895]  I mean, it was jam-packed with high-dollar ads.
[02:54:55.955 --> 02:55:00.657]  And then they had weird... I can do a story about that.
[02:55:01.178 --> 02:55:02.618]  Anti-cash ad.
[02:55:03.699 --> 02:55:05.980]  Showing people with cash how they hold up the lines.
[02:55:06.300 --> 02:55:08.481]  Actually, cash is quicker, studies have shown.
[02:55:08.701 --> 02:55:09.342]  Plus, you know that.
[02:55:09.402 --> 02:55:11.183]  You know, give them a twenty, give them a change back, and then it's quicker.
[02:55:11.503 --> 02:55:13.944]  Swiping and waiting and putting your code in and then signing.
[02:55:15.231 --> 02:55:18.093]  About how cash is dirty and evil and bad from Visa?
[02:55:18.474 --> 02:55:19.955]  I mean, this was just wall-to-wall.
[02:55:20.155 --> 02:55:29.122]  Marine Corps ads, Get Rid of the Cash, Mark of the Beast ads, drug ads, Navy ads, Air Force.
[02:55:29.182 --> 02:55:30.823]  I mean, I've never seen anything like it!
[02:55:34.626 --> 02:55:37.028]  I have never seen anything like it.
[02:55:38.507 --> 02:55:41.728]  And it was just, it was hitting on all cylinders.
[02:55:41.748 --> 02:55:45.949]  And by that, it wasn't hitting with one angle or two angles or three angles or four angles or five angles.
[02:55:46.489 --> 02:55:57.291]  And I mean, and then to have Lester Holt, NBC News anchor, nightly news anchor, introduce it on camera and then voice the whole thing.
[02:56:01.012 --> 02:56:02.912]  Unbelievable.
[02:56:05.333 --> 02:56:06.993]  Brought to you by the Marine Corps.
[02:56:08.448 --> 02:56:10.189]  Brought to you by Prozac.
[02:56:10.830 --> 02:56:12.691]  Brought to you by Let's Get Rid of the Cash.
[02:56:13.972 --> 02:56:15.753]  And see, these guys love being on the winning team.
[02:56:15.813 --> 02:56:18.855]  Lester Holt and this punk producer.
[02:56:19.195 --> 02:56:19.995]  They love it, man.
[02:56:20.035 --> 02:56:23.177]  They love being up in New York looking down on us little people.
