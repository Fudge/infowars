[00:00:01.596 --> 00:00:08.200]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio interview.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.521]  Scrap yourselves in.
[00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:10.161]  Hold on.
[00:00:11.182 --> 00:00:12.502]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:13.943 --> 00:00:15.784]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:19.507]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:19.587 --> 00:00:21.908]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.750]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.891]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.712 --> 00:00:44.433]  Well, look out on the roads across the United States this weekend.
[00:00:45.294 --> 00:00:54.877]  Look out for all the drunk illegal aliens and the state police dodging them, not stopping them, not arresting them, letting them go if they don't have IDs or insurance.
[00:00:55.618 --> 00:01:09.837]  Look out because the state police will be jumping highway ramps, sliding all over the grass, chasing down families going three miles over the speed limit, searching your vehicles, throwing your goods all over the streets while the illegal aliens swarm 30 plus million all over us.
[00:01:11.086 --> 00:01:15.567]  You can type into Google, police are ordered not to stop illegals, police are ordered not to arrest illegals.
[00:01:15.907 --> 00:01:21.048]  Hundreds of articles will pop up where they announce, because you see the illegal aliens are here to bring down the U.S.
[00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.089]  They're here to bring us into the new world order.
[00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.970]  They're here to make us like Mexico or Russia or China.
[00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.410]  And so they're precious and dear and special.
[00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.311]  American citizens are the marks.
[00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:35.932]  We are the marks that the system sees, trained from birth to be slaves.
[00:01:36.452 --> 00:01:36.992]  We're good to go.
[00:01:55.218 --> 00:02:04.101]  Also, understand you need to have a video camera on your speedometer showing you're going to speed limit because they claim they're calibrating their equipment.
[00:02:04.121 --> 00:02:04.701]  I don't believe it.
[00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:07.622]  I've seen them pull people over that are doing below the speed limit and give them tickets.
[00:02:08.202 --> 00:02:11.963]  Just be careful when you're out there on the roads in this police state cesspit that we live in.
[00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:13.543]  That's all I have to say to you.
[00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:14.403]  Watch out for the drunks.
[00:02:14.443 --> 00:02:15.304]  Watch out for the police.
[00:02:15.584 --> 00:02:16.384]  Watch out for them all.
[00:02:17.853 --> 00:02:20.015]  You can tell I'm a little bit angry today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:26.460]  I always am angry, and I promised myself I had a very reflective Friday night, a very reflective evening last night.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.904]  I'm so worried about the country and so upset by what I see that I can even work till 2 a.m.
[00:02:30.924 --> 00:02:36.028]  in the morning on my new film, Endgame, and still not be able to go to sleep, this without the aid of coffee.
[00:02:36.108 --> 00:02:42.994]  I am that upset, ladies and gentlemen, to see our country destroyed right in front of me and to see the decadent masses totally unaware of it.
[00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:44.790]  Now, it is painful.
[00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.691]  They are moving to pass complete total amnesty, as you know.
[00:02:48.372 --> 00:02:55.156]  The media has been trying to lie and claim that this is not the case, though we have the legislation, though supposedly they tried to keep it secret.
[00:02:56.316 --> 00:02:59.979]  We just have it all here in front of us today, so let me control myself for a moment.
[00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.799]  Reset.
[00:03:03.027 --> 00:03:04.768]  And get into the news.
[00:03:04.888 --> 00:03:05.728]  What is coming up?
[00:03:05.788 --> 00:03:16.673]  Vicente Fox, the former Mexican President, has been traveling the United States this week on a whirlwind trip throughout the Southwest and even as far north as Arkansas.
[00:03:17.853 --> 00:03:21.795]  Speaking to legislatures and media, telling us that we need to have total amnesty.
[00:03:22.575 --> 00:03:26.717]  Meddling in our affairs, the narco-terrorist leader of a narco-terrorist state.
[00:03:27.337 --> 00:03:29.558]  So we'll be going over that today.
[00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.872]  Also, Bush publicly sanctions black ops against Iran.
[00:03:34.313 --> 00:03:35.774]  Now, we've known for two and a half years.
[00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:45.340]  Well, we've known for three, but it's been admitted for two and a half, that terror bombings, attacks on dams, attacks on schools, attacks on government buildings have been carried out by U.S.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.785]  Special Forces, British Special Forces, and Israeli Special Forces leading Al-Qaeda attacks in the west of Iran.
[00:03:52.805 --> 00:03:54.066]  This is all over the foreign press.
[00:03:54.086 --> 00:04:00.070]  This is now publicly admitted by our government, with the Al-Qaeda shock troops hitting Iran, and hitting Iran hard.
[00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:02.476]  This is out of the London Telegraph.
[00:04:02.516 --> 00:04:03.777]  We'll be covering U.S.
[00:04:03.817 --> 00:04:06.420]  forces with Al-Qaeda hitting Iran hard.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.063]  If Iran dares strike back, it will be called Al-Qaeda terrorism.
[00:04:10.364 --> 00:04:12.386]  The general public, again, cannot find Iran.
[00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:14.127]  They think Iranians are Persians.
[00:04:14.248 --> 00:04:16.350]  I mean, are Arabs, not Persians.
[00:04:17.271 --> 00:04:22.916]  The head of the Armed Services Committee cannot tell the difference between a Shiite or a Sunni.
[00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:37.629]  And so again, our government, commanding Al-Qaeda as usual, as they did in Serbia in 1998-99, as they did against the Russians in the eight-year war against the Soviets in Afghanistan, as they commanded them in their black ops in London and on 9-11,
[00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.596]  They are running serious black ops in Iran, this time publicly, running Al-Qaeda attacks against the Iranians.
[00:04:44.896 --> 00:04:47.219]  If the Iranians fight back, they will be called Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:52.564]  You've got a public, ladies and gentlemen, who is so dumbed down that they will not even understand that when they hear it.
[00:04:53.545 --> 00:04:56.148]  I will break it down for you if you don't understand this.
[00:04:56.668 --> 00:05:02.394]  The sheer magnitude, the word isn't hypocrisy, it's so in our face
[00:05:02.894 --> 00:05:08.817]  That Al-Qaeda publicly is attacking Iran, and when Iran fights back on their border, they are called Al-Qaeda.
[00:05:10.338 --> 00:05:12.479]  I mean, it's so incredible!
[00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:19.242]  It's so incredible that it's admitted, and that still the people can't understand this.
[00:05:19.302 --> 00:05:27.886]  I know it's easier to go get a plastic bumper sticker made by Chinese slaves, and to stick it on your car that has an American flag symbol on it, than to actually know what the flag symbolizes.
[00:05:27.946 --> 00:05:28.387]  I understand.
[00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:31.268]  Alright, see, I said I wouldn't be cynical, and I'm doing it.
[00:05:31.804 --> 00:05:34.065]  Because, frankly, I'm disgusted and I'm sick of it.
[00:05:35.266 --> 00:05:37.948]  So, Bush sanctions black ops against Iran.
[00:05:39.168 --> 00:05:40.749]  We will go over that also.
[00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:42.810]  This is conservative Jerome Corsi.
[00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.312]  You know, he's the swift boat head guy.
[00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:57.915]  I've been a big supporter of Bush in the past until I convinced him that yes, Muslim extremists are a threat, but that there is a group above our government controlling the terrorists, and he now publicly has spoken about that and believes 9-11 could be an inside job.
[00:05:58.335 --> 00:06:04.538]  He also read, we talked about a few weeks ago, Presidential Decision Directive 51 that makes Bush officially a dictator.
[00:06:04.978 --> 00:06:09.140]  Now, don't worry, he'll hand that power over to Hillary, but we'll be going over.
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.522]  Bush is officially the first emperor of the United States.
[00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:14.763]  Now, I don't mean that jokingly.
[00:06:15.223 --> 00:06:24.668]  When Mexico got independence from Spain in 1822, their first leader called himself emperor of Mexico, and after that they had a king of the Americas and other things.
[00:06:24.868 --> 00:06:27.529]  So when you turn into a third world cesspit, you have dictators.
[00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.171]  And Bush has actually become the first
[00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:34.120]  Emperor of America and its holdings.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:41.324]  This is like Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, or the Fuhrer, the Emperor of Greater Germania, Hitler, as he was called.
[00:06:41.745 --> 00:06:43.586]  We now officially have an Emperor!
[00:06:44.266 --> 00:06:53.832]  And he will, of course, probably pass those Imperial powers over to Hillary or whoever else comes, and it's just all part of the Imperial government itself.
[00:06:53.993 --> 00:06:54.433]  By the way,
[00:06:55.657 --> 00:06:56.697]  There have been a few articles.
[00:06:56.737 --> 00:06:57.778]  There was an AP article.
[00:06:57.818 --> 00:06:59.198]  There was a blurb in the Washington Post.
[00:06:59.258 --> 00:07:00.959]  And they just announced it like it was good.
[00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:03.979]  They said, yes, the shadow government is now in complete control.
[00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:05.660]  This is for your safety.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.320]  So we'll be going over that.
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.421]  That's one of the main articles, main stories.
[00:07:10.741 --> 00:07:14.842]  But we're going to cover that first when we get back after this break.
[00:07:14.862 --> 00:07:22.764]  So the meddling in our affairs by the Mexican government, the massive media hoax and government hoax that the new legislation will stop illegal aliens,
[00:07:23.413 --> 00:07:24.734]  Well, it's like legalizing murder.
[00:07:24.774 --> 00:07:27.016]  I guess that would end murder if you just said it's not murder anymore.
[00:07:27.036 --> 00:07:30.139]  I guess it does legalize illegal, so there won't be any more illegal alien problem.
[00:07:31.572 --> 00:07:34.093]  Also, we have Judicial Watch here.
[00:07:34.113 --> 00:07:39.114]  Judicial Watch uncovers 3 deaths from the human papillomavirus vaccine.
[00:07:39.134 --> 00:07:41.354]  1,637 adverse reactions.
[00:07:41.374 --> 00:07:50.516]  By the way, they report that only 1 in 10 adverse reactions get reported with already developed drugs that are used nationwide.
[00:07:50.916 --> 00:07:55.497]  Generally, it's less than 1 in 100 with new drugs or vaccines.
[00:07:55.537 --> 00:07:56.317]  So, 1 in 100, 1,637.
[00:08:00.527 --> 00:08:08.600]  If 1 out of 100 or less get reported, and we have 1,637, we're talking about over 100,000 adverse reactions.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.943]  We're talking about Ebola-like things.
[00:08:10.963 --> 00:08:13.768]  You want to bleed out with pus coming out of every orifice?
[00:08:14.432 --> 00:08:16.713]  Well, we've got the actual documents.
[00:08:17.073 --> 00:08:19.293]  Enjoy your live cancer virus injection.
[00:08:20.134 --> 00:08:21.294]  We'll be going over that.
[00:08:21.954 --> 00:08:24.355]  Also, that's Judicial Watch.
[00:08:24.395 --> 00:08:25.515]  This is London Guardian.
[00:08:25.815 --> 00:08:28.276]  Government knew of HIV risk from imported blood.
[00:08:28.336 --> 00:08:28.916]  Continued it.
[00:08:29.516 --> 00:08:30.377]  The government loves you.
[00:08:30.857 --> 00:08:31.817]  This is LA Times.
[00:08:31.897 --> 00:08:34.638]  Common chemicals pose danger for fetuses, scientists warn.
[00:08:36.298 --> 00:08:38.781]  Medical experiments to be done without patient's consent.
[00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:42.625]  This is the Houston Chronicle, chairing a Washington Post article.
[00:08:42.745 --> 00:08:44.546]  Oh, everything's changing, see?
[00:08:44.907 --> 00:08:46.128]  It isn't about Al-Qaeda, folks.
[00:08:46.148 --> 00:08:48.971]  It's about medical experiments on you and your family without telling you.
[00:08:49.411 --> 00:08:50.693]  You see, that's what tyranny's all about.
[00:08:50.713 --> 00:08:52.975]  It's about taking that bank account without due process.
[00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:54.476]  It's about the IRS doing what they want.
[00:08:54.496 --> 00:08:56.799]  It's about CPS taking your children without due process.
[00:08:58.718 --> 00:09:00.560]  And the illegal aliens being above the law.
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:12.910]  I thought I'd re-pull the refinery documents from 1995-96 that were released in lawsuits by the AP in 2001, since oil prices are so high that everybody acts like it's a big mystery.
[00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:21.036]  They bought up all the refineries that were privately owned and shut them down to create an artificial bottleneck, and we have the actual oil company documents, their own memo, saying it.
[00:09:21.057 --> 00:09:21.637]  There's no debate.
[00:09:21.957 --> 00:09:23.238]  Just absolute fact.
[00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:27.342]  And they tell you it's because the environmentalists protest refineries.
[00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:29.483]  They fund those people.
[00:09:29.743 --> 00:09:31.284]  They fund those monkeys.
[00:09:31.624 --> 00:09:32.604]  They don't even know it.
[00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:34.385]  This is the A-game.
[00:09:34.605 --> 00:09:35.906]  This is the real world.
[00:09:35.926 --> 00:09:37.847]  This is where you get the info war.
[00:09:37.927 --> 00:09:40.588]  This is where you learn how the planet really operates.
[00:09:40.908 --> 00:09:44.290]  When we get back, the official dictatorship is launched.
[00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.451]  Will the arrest and concentration camps follow?
[00:09:47.772 --> 00:09:48.412]  We'll be right back.
[00:09:54.007 --> 00:10:09.119]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:10:09.479 --> 00:10:17.125]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:10:17.805 --> 00:10:24.849]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:36.755]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:10:36.995 --> 00:10:40.497]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.919]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:10:43.219 --> 00:10:47.061]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:10:55.448 --> 00:11:01.173]  Ted Anderson reminds us that May 25, 2007, gold 6.53 ounce gold coins could be purchased for 6.74.22, 3.32.70 for half and 1.66.35 for quarter.
[00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:01.573]  That's 6.74.22, 3.32.70 and 1.66.35.
[00:11:15.626 --> 00:11:21.593]  70% of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[00:11:21.693 --> 00:11:25.258]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[00:11:25.338 --> 00:11:26.279]  Bad news for U.S.
[00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:26.740]  currency.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.123]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[00:11:29.283 --> 00:11:30.685]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[00:11:30.925 --> 00:11:32.967]  Dollar has fallen to 65% of euro.
[00:11:33.108 --> 00:11:34.129]  Erosion accelerates.
[00:11:34.329 --> 00:11:36.850]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of U.S.
[00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.851]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[00:11:39.051 --> 00:11:41.492]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[00:11:41.712 --> 00:11:42.633]  Why attack Iran?
[00:11:42.773 --> 00:11:45.714]  Jerome O'Coursey's Iran leads attack against the U.S.
[00:11:45.754 --> 00:11:47.195]  dollar document spells it out.
[00:11:47.295 --> 00:11:49.316]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:11:49.776 --> 00:11:53.177]  The value of your hard-earned money is being destroyed in a global game of chess.
[00:11:53.357 --> 00:11:54.998]  Call 800-686-2237 for Coursey's report today.
[00:11:55.018 --> 00:11:55.298]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:04.212]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[00:12:04.512 --> 00:12:07.353]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[00:12:07.853 --> 00:12:10.054]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[00:12:10.694 --> 00:12:18.978]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[00:12:19.458 --> 00:12:20.018]  An example?
[00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:23.340]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:27.007]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[00:12:27.407 --> 00:12:30.710]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:36.636]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[00:12:37.276 --> 00:12:38.758]  Money is not the problem.
[00:12:38.978 --> 00:12:39.959]  Availability is.
[00:12:40.499 --> 00:12:40.960]  Be careful.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.225]  When food supplies get short, with no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:50.089]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com 800-409-5633
[00:13:00.641 --> 00:13:04.225]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:13:04.486 --> 00:13:05.346]  Look no further!
[00:13:05.647 --> 00:13:08.210]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:17.139]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.042]  You can order everything you need on the web.
[00:13:19.462 --> 00:13:19.902]  We're good to go.

[00:13:55.593 --> 00:13:57.713]  Box 281, Wildwood, PA 15091.
[00:13:57.753 --> 00:14:02.015]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:14:02.035 --> 00:14:03.335]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:05.176]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:22.715 --> 00:14:41.206]  Alright, we've got calls from France, and Ann Arbor, New York, Austin, Texas, listeners all across the country listening on the AM and FM dial, the internet at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, and we're also on WWCR, Worldwide Service with the Big Shortwave.
[00:14:43.467 --> 00:14:49.031]  Alright, let me just get into martial law, and I thought before I did this I would play just the intro.
[00:14:49.753 --> 00:14:56.377]  To a film I made three years ago, that I made in 2004, late 2004.
[00:14:57.138 --> 00:15:01.340]  It was released actually early 2005, so about two and a half years ago.
[00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:06.443]  And this is Martial Law, Rise of the Police State.
[00:15:06.483 --> 00:15:15.969]  I made a whole film about the preparations for Martial Law, and I think this sums up what we're facing now that the President is officially, I mean officially, there's no ifs, ands, or buts.
[00:15:16.229 --> 00:15:19.111]  Go to the White House website, it's all announced in black and white.
[00:15:19.611 --> 00:15:20.012]  We're good to go.
[00:15:38.167 --> 00:15:39.508]  Hell, let's be slaves!
[00:15:39.548 --> 00:15:40.749]  I mean, let's go ahead and play.
[00:15:40.849 --> 00:15:42.370]  Now, this isn't the best audio, because I just thought of this.
[00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:47.374]  We're playing this off YouTube, but there's a clip of it, so it's still pretty good audio, but it's a lot better on DVD.
[00:15:47.954 --> 00:15:52.477]  But here is the intro to my film, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[00:15:54.219 --> 00:16:02.645]  In the early years of the 21st century, terrorism was used by governments across the world as a pretext to scare their populations into submission.
[00:16:06.884 --> 00:16:13.989]  Life became a surveillance grid nightmare, with every individual's actions ruthlessly catalogued and recorded by the state.
[00:16:15.831 --> 00:16:19.874]  Secret arrests, checkpoints, and warrantless searches spread.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.123]  The final incremental march of the police state culminating in open martial law.
[00:16:29.344 --> 00:16:41.111]  This is the story of how the elite sold their people into slavery and scared the once proud and brave people of the West into submitting to being cannon fodder in wars for world domination.
[00:16:42.731 --> 00:16:44.352]  Our enemies have made clear
[00:16:49.606 --> 00:16:51.626]  The danger they pose to our security.
[00:16:55.147 --> 00:17:00.088]  We're just right outside the security perimeter at this national security event in New York City.
[00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:02.589]  It's a few hundred yards away from Madison Square Garden.
[00:17:02.769 --> 00:17:03.009]  Alright.
[00:17:03.029 --> 00:17:04.569]  For at least 10,000 policemen.
[00:17:04.749 --> 00:17:06.950]  That's the beginning of the intro into martial law.
[00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:08.070]  Three hour film I made.
[00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.770]  It's free on Google Video out there.
[00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.831]  You can buy the DVD at Infowars.com if you want.
[00:17:11.851 --> 00:17:12.851]  I frankly could care less.
[00:17:12.891 --> 00:17:16.592]  I can't even enjoy the little bit of money I got in the bank because all I do is work to fight this stuff.
[00:17:17.032 --> 00:17:17.772]  So I don't even care about
[00:17:18.667 --> 00:17:19.588]  Any of it anymore, folks.
[00:17:19.948 --> 00:17:21.349]  We're so far down the rattle.
[00:17:21.929 --> 00:17:24.810]  My children's futures are in such grave peril.
[00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.432]  Yours are, too, but people aren't very receptive anymore.
[00:17:28.472 --> 00:17:38.378]  We've become dulled by the culture, the entertainment, the materialism, to the point of where people are completely blind to what's going on around them.
[00:17:38.778 --> 00:17:43.120]  People don't see the more subtle things, the incrementalism.
[00:17:43.941 --> 00:17:44.581]  This weekend,
[00:17:46.568 --> 00:18:11.332]  I was doing some research on Nazi Germany and their incremental march to power, and I was reminded by Milton Mayer of the University of Chicago Press, who put out the book, They Thought They Were Free, about his life in Germany in 1933 and 1945, and there's a quote in here by people who were in Germany during the time about how it incrementally built up.
[00:18:11.372 --> 00:18:13.093]  Let me just read some of this now.
[00:18:13.113 --> 00:18:15.213]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.com and read seven pages.
[00:18:16.134 --> 00:18:19.117]  I'm just going to read a few paragraphs.
[00:18:19.778 --> 00:18:21.199]  But then it was too late.
[00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:30.469]  What no one seemed to notice, said a colleague of mine, was the ever-widening gap after 1933 between the government and the people.
[00:18:31.184 --> 00:18:34.586]  Just think how very wide the gap was to begin with here in Germany.
[00:18:34.986 --> 00:18:36.907]  And it became always wider, you know.
[00:18:36.987 --> 00:18:46.211]  It doesn't make people close to their government to be told that this is a people's government, a true democracy, or to be enrolled in a civilian defense, or even to vote.
[00:18:46.671 --> 00:18:50.954]  All this has little, really nothing, to do with knowing one is governing.
[00:18:51.934 --> 00:18:58.097]  What happened here was the gradual habituation, or habitualization, of the people, little by little,
[00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:12.735]  To being governed by surprise, to receiving decisions deliberated on in secret, to believing that the situation was so complicated that the government had to act on information which the people could not understand.
[00:19:13.255 --> 00:19:20.483]  Or so dangerous that even if the people could not understand it, it could not be released because of national security.
[00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:30.626]  After their sense of identification with Hitler, their trust in him made it easier to widen this gap and reassured those who would otherwise have worried about it.
[00:19:31.667 --> 00:19:49.977]  And it goes on to say, the separation of government from the people, this widening of the gap took place so gradually and so slowly, each step designed, perhaps not even intentionally, as a temporary emergency measure or associated with true patriotic allegiance or with real social purposes and all that
[00:19:50.703 --> 00:20:03.129]  The crisis and the reforms, real reforms too, so occupied the people that they did not see the slow motion underneath of the whole process of government growing remoter and remoter.
[00:20:03.649 --> 00:20:07.731]  And then it goes into how they woke up suddenly and they were in deep, dark tyranny.
[00:20:10.813 --> 00:20:17.056]  A poor slave knew a thousand years ago that the guardians, the inquisitors, the torturers, the enforcers wore black.
[00:20:18.872 --> 00:20:21.293]  Today, the public doesn't even know that, my friends.
[00:20:21.453 --> 00:20:28.195]  Every trapping, every signal, every sign, the government knows that subconsciously you understand this, so they do it all to intimidate you.
[00:20:28.815 --> 00:20:31.836]  The government is bought and paid for by foreign interest, my friends.
[00:20:32.696 --> 00:20:33.457]  And it's real simple.
[00:20:33.557 --> 00:20:34.697]  America went bad.
[00:20:35.717 --> 00:20:40.519]  That's not saying you're bad, or I'm bad, or Ron Paul's bad, or Pat Buchanan's bad.
[00:20:41.374 --> 00:20:48.099]  It's not saying we individually are bad, or that Trey Kincaid in there, or Paul in there running the show right now are bad.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.881]  It means, I mean, it's like take the average Mexican people.
[00:20:51.382 --> 00:21:05.213]  They're good, smart, family people, but they have a corrupt government, and their last five presidents had to flee, stealing billions apiece, to New York, or to Spain, to Madrid, or to Switzerland.
[00:21:05.713 --> 00:21:09.496]  Fox is the first one to not leave Mexico, and he probably will as more and more corruption comes out.
[00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:12.826]  I mean, it's a corrupt country where the people can't ever get ahead.
[00:21:12.906 --> 00:21:14.549]  Corruption ties them down.
[00:21:14.949 --> 00:21:19.617]  They have the richest elite in the world per capita and one of the poorest populations in the world, by the way.
[00:21:20.979 --> 00:21:25.326]  They have triple the resources that America has, but everybody knows Mexico's corrupt.
[00:21:25.825 --> 00:21:27.466]  Because they gave in to corruption.
[00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:29.106]  Oh, it's just a little corruption.
[00:21:29.146 --> 00:21:30.386]  Oh, it's a little payoff.
[00:21:30.907 --> 00:21:32.447]  Because they were born out of corruption.
[00:21:32.887 --> 00:21:35.828]  The Aztec and Mayan culture's corruption, incredibly wicked.
[00:21:36.188 --> 00:21:39.649]  Then the Spanish came and kind of melded those two corruptions together.
[00:21:39.929 --> 00:21:41.310]  The Spanish imperial corruption.
[00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:42.750]  And they've never had freedom.
[00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.071]  They'll never have freedom.
[00:21:44.111 --> 00:21:45.371]  It's so ingrained in the culture.
[00:21:45.731 --> 00:21:48.192]  Freedom and liberty was so special, so rare.
[00:21:48.272 --> 00:21:49.573]  Russia will never have real freedom.
[00:21:49.853 --> 00:21:52.014]  They've given into corruption thousands of years ago.
[00:21:52.354 --> 00:21:53.794]  China will never have real freedom.
[00:21:54.095 --> 00:21:55.615]  India will never have real freedom.
[00:21:55.715 --> 00:21:56.575]  It's in the culture.
[00:21:58.136 --> 00:22:03.338]  Western culture that came really out of Mount Sinai and the Levitical Law
[00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:12.472]  Those thousands of laws then grew into the Magna Carta in 1215 and into our Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution.
[00:22:14.172 --> 00:22:18.273]  It's all gone, folks, and it will probably never be brought back again.
[00:22:18.293 --> 00:22:23.935]  I have to tell you, the only chance we've got is realizing how far we've slipped.
[00:22:24.655 --> 00:22:25.375]  America's dead.
[00:22:26.235 --> 00:22:28.336]  The last vestiges are all I'm trying to save.
[00:22:29.336 --> 00:22:31.076]  And believe me, you're going to be in bondage now.
[00:22:31.096 --> 00:22:31.997]  You're going to be a peon.
[00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.037]  You're going to be shoved around.
[00:22:33.999 --> 00:22:35.461]  You're gonna have to pay police off.
[00:22:35.501 --> 00:22:36.503]  You're gonna live in tyranny.
[00:22:37.704 --> 00:22:38.746]  Unless you wake up.
[00:22:38.766 --> 00:22:41.229]  There's just some tiny chance.
[00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.413]  We'll be right back after this break.
[00:22:43.633 --> 00:22:45.355]  Get into the true martial law we're now under.
[00:22:45.776 --> 00:22:47.759]  And take your calls and get into a host of other issues.
[00:22:47.779 --> 00:22:48.540]  Stay with me.
[00:23:00.546 --> 00:23:03.267]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[00:23:03.707 --> 00:23:06.008]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[00:23:06.308 --> 00:23:09.389]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[00:23:09.869 --> 00:23:12.009]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[00:23:12.189 --> 00:23:13.570]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.951]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[00:23:18.271 --> 00:23:21.392]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[00:23:21.692 --> 00:23:22.933]  With more than 500 vital functions.
[00:23:24.153 --> 00:23:32.438]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with Live52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.
[00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:35.480]  And it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.

[00:23:50.108 --> 00:23:51.388]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:24:00.814 --> 00:24:01.574]  Terrorism!
[00:24:01.735 --> 00:24:02.475]  Terrorism!
[00:24:02.595 --> 00:24:08.658]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:24:08.918 --> 00:24:10.499]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:24:10.759 --> 00:24:13.220]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:28.188]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:24:28.228 --> 00:24:28.528]  government.
[00:24:28.708 --> 00:24:30.509]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:24:30.889 --> 00:24:36.793]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:24:36.933 --> 00:24:41.436]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:25:00.518 --> 00:25:02.239]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.641]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:25:03.861 --> 00:25:06.703]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:25:07.063 --> 00:25:09.825]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:25:10.366 --> 00:25:17.111]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[00:25:17.671 --> 00:25:25.317]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers, from humorous to serious, at LibertyStickers.com.
[00:25:26.298 --> 00:25:26.679]  I think so.
[00:25:41.015 --> 00:25:41.175]  Call 877-873-9626
[00:25:59.249 --> 00:26:01.971]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?

[00:26:52.953 --> 00:26:54.634]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:26:54.734 --> 00:26:56.215]  Home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[00:27:11.536 --> 00:27:14.118]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:17.901]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:27:20.383 --> 00:27:23.346]  Okay, I'm looking at these calls, and they look great.
[00:27:23.366 --> 00:27:29.370]  I mean, we've got people wanting to talk about the police state from New York.
[00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:33.514]  A lady from Ann Arbor, Michigan, wanting to talk about black ops.
[00:27:33.914 --> 00:27:37.557]  Cheryl in France, as the UN is screwing up children's rights over there.
[00:27:37.577 --> 00:27:39.679]  Tim in Chicago, Carlisle.
[00:27:39.819 --> 00:27:41.040]  I'm going to go with Cheryl in France.
[00:27:41.744 --> 00:27:45.647]  First, that's over there with the European Union.
[00:27:46.948 --> 00:27:49.690]  But let me just right now get into the Marshall Law.
[00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:52.572]  Let me just give you the history.
[00:27:52.792 --> 00:27:59.256]  In 1913, private banks took over our banking system and the issuance and coining of money directing the Treasury.
[00:27:59.557 --> 00:28:03.940]  With that, they were able to buy up most of the government, buy up most of the newspapers and media.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.483]  In 1933, three years into the Depression, they had engineered, that's now mainstream history,
[00:28:09.063 --> 00:28:09.324]  I think so.
[00:28:26.281 --> 00:28:28.323]  Or they were around during the thirties, they'll remember that.
[00:28:28.603 --> 00:28:33.427]  They sent police around trying to, at gunpoint, order people to give their gold up or they did raids on houses.
[00:28:33.467 --> 00:28:34.427]  We hear you've got gold.
[00:28:34.647 --> 00:28:35.508]  That was what it was all about.
[00:28:35.728 --> 00:28:38.791]  But the government wasn't big enough at that time, so they started expanding it.
[00:28:39.391 --> 00:28:46.076]  Then with the 1947 National Security Act, the shadow government was fully formed and got massive funding.
[00:28:46.456 --> 00:28:50.740]  We're talking trillions of dollars overall in the aggregate since it was set up in 1947.
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.003]  Then the CIA started importing the narcotics or controlling
[00:28:55.243 --> 00:28:55.743]  We're good to go.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:26.731]  And so then from that point on we see the expansion of the War Powers Act and every year they have some new crisis and the government always is operating year from year under a crisis.
[00:29:27.692 --> 00:29:29.934]  And if you just type in Presidential Directive 51
[00:29:32.802 --> 00:29:33.762]  I mean, don't believe me.
[00:29:33.822 --> 00:29:36.403]  Just type in Presidential Decision Directive.
[00:29:36.603 --> 00:29:40.664]  Well, if you type in Presidential Decision Directive, the proper name, it won't come up first link.
[00:29:40.684 --> 00:29:43.045]  Type in Presidential Directive 51.
[00:29:43.385 --> 00:29:51.987]  First link, at least a few minutes ago when I checked, is on Google, or on Scroogle, or Dogpile, or Yahoo, is thewhitehouse.gov.
[00:29:52.428 --> 00:29:54.588]  I want you to go read it there for yourself.
[00:29:55.188 --> 00:29:57.349]  I know you've been conditioned, preconditioned, not to listen to me.
[00:29:58.585 --> 00:30:05.113]  And it says that for any environmental reason, economic reason, government functions, population infrastructure...
[00:30:06.904 --> 00:30:13.187]  Anything that the President now can circumvent the entire Congress, the judicial branch, the governors.
[00:30:13.727 --> 00:30:20.249]  You see, in the past, under continuity of government, there were still designates in the Congress, and it was still bad enough.
[00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:20.810]  No, no, no.
[00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:23.391]  He's even taken the power away from Homeland Security.
[00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:29.033]  It's a continual centralization, directly to the hands of the President.
[00:30:30.514 --> 00:30:35.536]  So the President's been a puppet, really, off and on for the last hundred years, but totally since 1963.
[00:30:36.869 --> 00:30:38.570]  This is kind of the reverse of that.
[00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:48.375]  We have the elite, I guess, showing trust in the President and actually secreting power that was in the shadow government directly into his hands, as if they don't even trust the Congress now.
[00:30:49.536 --> 00:30:51.057]  Folks, this is so scary.
[00:30:52.398 --> 00:30:55.179]  In fact, I would tell Congress they better worry about the presidency.
[00:30:55.199 --> 00:31:01.743]  And by the way, history shows that with the Caesars and Third World and Russia and what's happening in Latin America right now with Chavez.
[00:31:02.564 --> 00:31:22.312]  I mean, when the President takes full authority away from the legislative and judicial, and starts talking about massive decapitations of the legislative, historically it is executives, it is emperors, who launch attacks on any vestiges or any remnants of power that could rival them.
[00:31:23.542 --> 00:31:32.646]  And then they start talking about they've done this because they think there will be an attempted decapitation of the legislative and judicial and gubernatorial.
[00:31:33.806 --> 00:31:34.606]  But let's go back.
[00:31:34.666 --> 00:31:36.727]  With Patriot Act, they made all U.S.
[00:31:36.747 --> 00:31:39.028]  citizens terrorists under Section 802.
[00:31:39.228 --> 00:31:45.671]  Any threat or any, even if they believe you've committed a misdemeanor, secret arrest, secret execution.
[00:31:46.371 --> 00:31:51.413]  And I wrote the analysis of that back in 2001 and won the Project Censored award for that, by the way.
[00:31:52.657 --> 00:31:54.698]  We had university scholars and lawyers look at my analysis.
[00:31:54.918 --> 00:31:55.858]  People couldn't believe it at the time.
[00:31:55.878 --> 00:31:57.138]  They actually did find it was in the U.S.
[00:31:57.178 --> 00:31:57.438]  Code.
[00:31:57.838 --> 00:31:58.578]  It's not just a bill.
[00:31:58.598 --> 00:31:59.239]  You have to go to the U.S.
[00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:00.539]  Code to learn how to read U.S.
[00:32:00.579 --> 00:32:00.839]  Code.
[00:32:01.359 --> 00:32:03.740]  Not very hard when you actually just spend five or six hours doing it.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.941]  Again, I know American Idol is on, so you can't learn about the FEMA camps.
[00:32:08.001 --> 00:32:08.481]  I understand.
[00:32:09.181 --> 00:32:16.463]  It's important to wear stylish clothes and act powerful and strut around or to actually be a man and actually defend your country.
[00:32:16.483 --> 00:32:16.903]  I understand.
[00:32:17.623 --> 00:32:20.744]  But I'm going to your calls in the next segment, folks, but I've got to cover this now.
[00:32:22.452 --> 00:32:24.673]  And so, things got worse and worse with Patriot Act 1.5.
[00:32:24.713 --> 00:32:27.134]  They didn't get the full Patriot Act 2.
[00:32:27.294 --> 00:32:35.438]  Then, they did get Patriot Act 2, what they'd asked for, last year with the Military Commissions Act, which with slight of hand said we secretly strip U.S.
[00:32:35.478 --> 00:32:36.819]  citizens of citizenship.
[00:32:38.239 --> 00:32:44.002]  Under Section 802, it tied back in and coupled with the Patriot Act, H.R.
[00:32:44.022 --> 00:32:44.342]  3162, passed October 27, 2001.
[00:32:48.761 --> 00:33:04.047]  And it it it last year they passed that and it coupled with it the Military Commissions Act and so they can secretly arrest citizens, secretly torture citizens, use torture in secret tribunals, even if the tribunals find you not guilty they can still secretly execute you, it's all in there
[00:33:05.257 --> 00:33:08.419]  Take over the media, run FEMA camps, it's all in there.
[00:33:08.839 --> 00:33:14.242]  Then they announced the Houston Chronicle, they are building giant one million man camps all over the country for American citizens.
[00:33:14.562 --> 00:33:26.409]  But they followed the 1980-60 classification, or leak, of Rex 84, that they would claim it was for illegal aliens, shut them up, run a few illegals through them for deportation, but then use it on citizens after a staged event.
[00:33:26.729 --> 00:33:34.473]  And hence, they've got the camp just north of Austin, the UN was just out there, again, playing the part of the good cop, more sophisticated propaganda when they're all part of the same mechanism.
[00:33:35.043 --> 00:33:38.464]  But giving you the illusion that it is the group you go to to save you from this tyranny.
[00:33:39.344 --> 00:33:41.584]  They do that with the EU, and it's tyrannizing people.
[00:33:41.604 --> 00:33:44.305]  Then people run to the UN, and the EU does what the UN says.
[00:33:44.585 --> 00:33:46.265]  Again, setting precedent that they're the authority.
[00:33:47.005 --> 00:33:49.866]  But again, I'm digressing on this martial law question here.
[00:33:51.026 --> 00:34:00.528]  Conservative, liberal commentators, lawyers, professors of law, and of jurisprudence, philosophy, anyone who's looked at this, of law philosophy, the philosophy of law, we've interviewed them all.
[00:34:01.483 --> 00:34:02.944]  On this subject, Military Commissions Act.
[00:34:03.444 --> 00:34:14.588]  And even more dangerous was the funding last year for the fiscal year announcement that Bush just made with the signing of the Presidential Decision Directive 51.
[00:34:16.529 --> 00:34:30.275]  And under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007, it erases all governors, and it erases the state and national guards fully, any local control, under the federal control, or under the President's designate's control.
[00:34:32.009 --> 00:34:37.111]  And it allows the importation of foreign militaries to, quote, deal with American terrorists.
[00:34:37.131 --> 00:34:38.091]  That's the Army Times.
[00:34:38.471 --> 00:34:43.133]  And we now have the new NORTHCOM operating, which was operating before 9-11, announced after 9-11.
[00:34:43.153 --> 00:34:46.534]  Because they've always got to have it... Homeland Security was set up in 93.
[00:34:46.954 --> 00:34:47.855]  Declassified in 98.
[00:34:49.413 --> 00:34:50.774]  We have news clips admitting that.
[00:34:51.695 --> 00:34:55.278]  But again, this is all administration after administration.
[00:34:55.298 --> 00:34:56.679]  They're all working with the same people.
[00:34:56.979 --> 00:34:58.561]  It's all an intelligence operation.
[00:34:58.881 --> 00:35:01.943]  It's all a military operation for the private banks that own America.
[00:35:02.824 --> 00:35:05.486]  And now to have the president for the first time in U.S.
[00:35:05.506 --> 00:35:11.351]  history, because even Lincoln didn't announce these powers when he briefly did take dictatorial powers, but he didn't announce himself emperor.
[00:35:11.791 --> 00:35:15.975]  Bush has said that he, it says in the document, he grants himself
[00:35:17.665 --> 00:35:19.166]  It's kind of like if I granted myself.
[00:35:19.206 --> 00:35:20.747]  I just said, oh, I'm allowed to rob the bank.
[00:35:21.607 --> 00:35:22.968]  I grant myself that power.
[00:35:23.028 --> 00:35:25.730]  Or, I grant myself the power to eat cyanide and live.
[00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:27.271]  You really can't do that.
[00:35:28.231 --> 00:35:31.733]  And you can go read where the President says, the President grants himself the power.
[00:35:32.033 --> 00:35:34.835]  That'd be like an egg coming before the chicken.
[00:35:34.895 --> 00:35:37.276]  An egg just appears and a chicken hatches out of it.
[00:35:38.097 --> 00:35:39.878]  As if an egg created a chicken.
[00:35:41.699 --> 00:35:44.441]  The President can't say, I give myself this power.
[00:35:45.421 --> 00:35:46.902]  I give myself this new power.
[00:35:48.562 --> 00:35:54.606]  You can't do that under the Bill of Rights, under the Constitution, under common sense, under Levitical law, under any of it.
[00:35:55.627 --> 00:35:56.448]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:35:57.288 --> 00:36:04.113]  That doesn't matter one iota under the Magna Carta Bill of Rights, any of it, because Napoleon said, you are guilty until proven innocent.
[00:36:04.873 --> 00:36:05.654]  I am a dictator.
[00:36:05.894 --> 00:36:06.715]  I am the Emperor.
[00:36:07.355 --> 00:36:08.316]  I am the Grand Emperor.
[00:36:09.997 --> 00:36:14.380]  Just like Maximilian did down in 1822 in Mexico, declaring himself Emperor.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.442]  First it was Emperor of Mexico, then it was Emperor of the Americas.
[00:36:19.031 --> 00:36:20.012]  And that's just what they do.
[00:36:21.113 --> 00:36:24.976]  And this is official, mainstream news, but they just, but they announce it like it's good.
[00:36:24.996 --> 00:36:26.717]  They go, oh yes, he's now a dictator.
[00:36:27.358 --> 00:36:27.578]  Uh-huh.
[00:36:28.058 --> 00:36:29.980]  For any environmental reason, any reason.
[00:36:31.301 --> 00:36:38.727]  So, uh, we'll come back, I promise, go to France, go to New York, go to Ann Arbor, go to Chicago, go to Liberty Hill, Austin, Texas.
[00:36:39.627 --> 00:36:40.568]  Good idea to give the number out, 877-595-525.
[00:36:43.539 --> 00:36:45.103]  PrisonPlanet.com is the website.
[00:36:45.123 --> 00:36:46.807]  On the right-hand side, we have News in Focus.
[00:36:46.827 --> 00:36:49.655]  We have the news stories covering Howard Allender, a dictatorship.
[00:36:49.935 --> 00:36:50.537]  We'll be right back.
[00:37:01.471 --> 00:37:12.475]  JLS Research, the makers of all-natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[00:37:12.695 --> 00:37:19.197]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[00:37:19.357 --> 00:37:27.040]  By using organics and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:27.940]  As it responds,
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.242]  Body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[00:37:30.522 --> 00:37:32.363]  First Responder is a purse of its kind.
[00:37:32.443 --> 00:37:34.024]  Comprised of only four organics.
[00:37:34.325 --> 00:37:37.607]  Grape seed skins, grape seeds, grape fruit seed, and garlic.
[00:37:37.967 --> 00:37:42.451]  It's so effective you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[00:37:42.771 --> 00:37:45.293]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.
[00:37:45.553 --> 00:37:47.675]  Go online and order First Responder at No-BO.com.
[00:37:47.715 --> 00:37:49.456]  Visit No-BO.com or call JLS Research.
[00:37:52.478 --> 00:37:53.019]  At 850-723-8599 That's 850-723-8599
[00:38:01.525 --> 00:38:03.306]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[00:38:03.586 --> 00:38:06.428]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[00:38:06.928 --> 00:38:09.129]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[00:38:09.769 --> 00:38:18.054]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[00:38:18.534 --> 00:38:19.094]  An example?
[00:38:19.615 --> 00:38:22.456]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[00:38:23.337 --> 00:38:26.098]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[00:38:26.478 --> 00:38:29.740]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[00:38:30.515 --> 00:38:35.699]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[00:38:36.339 --> 00:38:37.821]  Money is not the problem.
[00:38:38.041 --> 00:38:39.042]  Availability is.
[00:38:39.562 --> 00:38:41.423]  Be careful when food supplies get short.
[00:38:41.664 --> 00:38:45.346]  With no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[00:38:45.967 --> 00:38:49.169]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633
[00:39:01.708 --> 00:39:10.796]  Now, you could upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:39:11.036 --> 00:39:22.266]  Black quirky elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:39:22.606 --> 00:39:23.407]  Nitrates, nitrites,

[00:41:05.979 --> 00:41:08.161]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:41:12.483 --> 00:41:14.725]  Coming to you from the capital of Texas,
[00:41:15.413 --> 00:41:27.264]  Broadcasting the truth coast to coast and worldwide, this is the Alex Jones Show!
[00:41:27.304 --> 00:41:30.327]  The last ditch defense of the republic, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:30.367 --> 00:41:35.412]  I know a lot of you haven't got the word yet, but we're in dire straits, and I'm not pulling any punches.
[00:41:35.792 --> 00:41:36.793]  I've done my homework.
[00:41:37.634 --> 00:41:38.395]  I know my history.
[00:41:39.179 --> 00:41:45.742]  And let me tell you, I've never seen any setup for tyranny this methodical, this big, this dangerous.
[00:41:46.403 --> 00:41:51.465]  I literally have the hair standing up on the back of my neck five or six times a day as I study this stuff.
[00:41:52.005 --> 00:41:53.686]  They're setting up something monstrous.
[00:41:54.227 --> 00:41:55.787]  And I'm giving you the warning right now.
[00:41:56.528 --> 00:41:56.928]  Look out!
[00:41:57.754 --> 00:42:01.817]  The New World Order is making their move to the United States, and they're not playing games.
[00:42:02.218 --> 00:42:06.281]  They've got 21st century propaganda to brainwash you, and it's working like a charm.
[00:42:06.641 --> 00:42:07.202]  Well, the U.S.
[00:42:07.242 --> 00:42:09.784]  government's working with Al-Qaeda to attack Iran.
[00:42:10.284 --> 00:42:12.266]  It's mainstream news, hidden in plain view.
[00:42:12.386 --> 00:42:14.507]  It's in major British and foreign newspapers.
[00:42:14.828 --> 00:42:16.429]  Other foreign newspapers will be covering that.
[00:42:16.669 --> 00:42:20.252]  But right now, let's get through a bunch of your calls for everybody that's been patiently holding.
[00:42:21.293 --> 00:42:23.874]  Let's go ahead and talk to Cheryl in France.
[00:42:24.734 --> 00:42:26.955]  Cheryl, I appreciate you holding.
[00:42:27.275 --> 00:42:28.636]  You are on the air.
[00:42:28.696 --> 00:42:29.036]  Welcome.
[00:42:29.796 --> 00:42:30.197]  Okay.
[00:42:31.077 --> 00:42:35.439]  I just want to thank you for what you're doing because you're waking up a lot of people.
[00:42:36.919 --> 00:42:41.941]  I've been aware of what's going on for about the last five years.
[00:42:42.481 --> 00:42:44.222]  One day my kids came home from school.
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:56.725]  And I corrected one of my sons who told me that he had a right to have a lawyer and that if I was going to touch him that I could get in trouble.
[00:42:57.566 --> 00:43:00.667]  And I said, what is this business you're talking about?
[00:43:01.503 --> 00:43:07.168]  And at school, they have been teaching to the children in the little, you know, primary... The same thing here.
[00:43:07.208 --> 00:43:14.393]  All they do is teach rebellion against the family because the enemy knows that their main enemy is the family.
[00:43:14.693 --> 00:43:19.797]  And this is in actual government textbooks that for world government to be set up, they've got to destroy the family.
[00:43:20.058 --> 00:43:23.460]  They've gone from like 10% illegitimacy... That's what they did in Russia.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.042]  That's what they've done in China.
[00:43:25.162 --> 00:43:25.402]  Yes.
[00:43:25.442 --> 00:43:26.963]  That's what they do everywhere.
[00:43:27.143 --> 00:43:29.265]  And we as, well,
[00:43:30.345 --> 00:43:30.906]  How can I say?
[00:43:30.946 --> 00:43:31.666]  Patriots?
[00:43:32.026 --> 00:43:33.027]  Me, as a Christian?
[00:43:33.047 --> 00:43:35.848]  I mean, we can't let this... What are you doing in France?
[00:43:35.888 --> 00:43:36.608]  I'm just curious.
[00:43:37.469 --> 00:43:37.769]  Pardon?
[00:43:37.789 --> 00:43:38.889]  What are you doing in France?
[00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:42.731]  Oh, I've been in France for, like, 20 years.
[00:43:42.951 --> 00:43:44.312]  I fell in love with a Frenchman.
[00:43:44.892 --> 00:43:47.293]  And so, I'm from, you know, I'm American.
[00:43:47.313 --> 00:43:49.114]  So does your children go to a government?
[00:43:49.134 --> 00:43:52.596]  I feel like I'm more American than a lot of Americans, because they're just...
[00:43:53.248 --> 00:43:54.529]  You know, they don't care.
[00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:55.910]  They just don't care.
[00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:59.471]  You can never have these things if they think you're crazy, and you're not, you know?
[00:43:59.532 --> 00:44:01.933]  Do your children go to a re-education center or government school?
[00:44:02.793 --> 00:44:09.257]  Well, they were in government school, but what I figured the most important thing was for them to see what I lived at home.
[00:44:09.918 --> 00:44:10.958]  They had to see it.
[00:44:11.438 --> 00:44:30.883]  If they can see me living the way, how can I say, having the love, the patience, the discernment, the firmity, just being a good parent and being there for them and listening to them and showing them all the garbage they're getting.
[00:44:31.503 --> 00:44:42.309]  Because when the eldest, when they got to high school, they go through a philosophy class that is aimed at absolutely breaking down anything they've ever believed in, ever.
[00:44:42.389 --> 00:44:43.430]  No, I know, absolutely.
[00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:44.671]  Good to hear from you from France.
[00:44:45.371 --> 00:44:58.839]  Yeah, I mean, when I read, it was about six years ago, the official University of Texas textbook put out by Calhoun, and I showed it on television, but it was actually Bob Dacey's son came across it in college.
[00:44:59.443 --> 00:45:06.368]  And it's used all over the country and it's called the family of disease and taught social workers to go and take everybody's children.
[00:45:06.388 --> 00:45:10.491]  Of course, his son was taking some of those classes to be a policeman.
[00:45:10.511 --> 00:45:12.393]  He's a policeman now, but he wanted the full degree.
[00:45:12.753 --> 00:45:14.234]  So he was taking some of the same courses.
[00:45:15.326 --> 00:45:17.147]  But I need to dig that up.
[00:45:17.187 --> 00:45:21.409]  He made me a scanned copy, a photocopy of the pages, and I was unable to find it.
[00:45:21.429 --> 00:45:26.451]  In fact, whoever's got that major textbook, I know they're all over the place, remind me of the exact name.
[00:45:26.471 --> 00:45:28.992]  I know it was a Calhoun, published by Calhoun.
[00:45:29.012 --> 00:45:29.853]  I forget the exact name.
[00:45:29.893 --> 00:45:30.813]  It was a big textbook.
[00:45:31.093 --> 00:45:33.174]  I want to find that again and do a whole story on it.
[00:45:33.194 --> 00:45:35.215]  I mean, it says the family is a disease.
[00:45:36.216 --> 00:45:36.876]  It's backwards.
[00:45:36.916 --> 00:45:37.756]  It must be eliminated.
[00:45:37.776 --> 00:45:38.837]  It's your job to eliminate it.
[00:45:39.057 --> 00:45:40.918]  I mean, there's no bones about it, okay?
[00:45:41.258 --> 00:45:43.139]  There's no bones about this.
[00:45:44.506 --> 00:45:46.849]  And yeah, of course, in Russia and China it's the same thing.
[00:45:46.869 --> 00:45:55.357]  And that's why Russia and China have those huge, all the famous videos and films that have been shot in the orphanages of the kids with lice, with their hair all falling out, running around naked.
[00:45:55.557 --> 00:45:58.160]  They can't even speak, throwing feces at each other.
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:02.084]  And the government just locks them up in pens, anything to destroy the family.
[00:46:02.524 --> 00:46:04.687]  You understand it's cold-blooded, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:05.007 --> 00:46:06.109]  Cold-blooded is what it is.
[00:46:06.149 --> 00:46:13.478]  And all the news and announcements are out there, they're looking out for you and they're watching you and you better be good like you're a child and there's Santa Claus.
[00:46:13.498 --> 00:46:15.720]  You know, he's making a list, they're checking it twice.
[00:46:15.921 --> 00:46:19.365]  The filthy degenerate scumbag government's gonna know who's naughty and nice.
[00:46:20.635 --> 00:46:21.556]  I mean, take CPS.
[00:46:21.696 --> 00:46:26.138]  Five times more likely federal numbers to abuse children or children to die in their custody.
[00:46:26.439 --> 00:46:27.860]  But then they're the people over the children.
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:28.480]  See?
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:35.624]  Everybody knows the government runs the smack and the cocaine and all of it, but they're gonna search your house to see if you've got any of it.
[00:46:35.804 --> 00:46:38.766]  They ship it in, then they turn their dogs loose on us.
[00:46:38.926 --> 00:46:40.167]  Well, I don't use your filth.
[00:46:40.467 --> 00:46:43.149]  I'd never use the degenerate scum you put out.
[00:46:43.489 --> 00:46:46.271]  I'd never use your Ritalin or Prozac you spew at the young people.
[00:46:46.491 --> 00:46:52.674]  Your legal drugs whose molecules are each more deadly than methamphetamine and cocaine and heroin combined.
[00:46:53.334 --> 00:46:54.115]  Major studies.
[00:46:54.155 --> 00:46:57.476]  Go read the molecular chart on the drug insert.
[00:46:57.517 --> 00:46:59.678]  You don't even know what that means, do you?
[00:46:59.858 --> 00:47:06.521]  You just know how to kick down doors and destroy families who are dumb enough to use the addictive crap your bosses ship in here.
[00:47:07.421 --> 00:47:07.942]  Excuse me.
[00:47:09.442 --> 00:47:12.604]  I'm getting madder and madder, folks, because when they declare martial law,
[00:47:13.445 --> 00:47:15.030]  Again, they set it up, they're doing it.
[00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:22.269]  I mean, folks, when the Senate says, we're going to have a secret bill and vote on it in secret and you can't see it, but trust us, it's going to fix the illegals.
[00:47:23.484 --> 00:47:27.106]  Then they have a few illegals go protest who've been told it's against them.
[00:47:27.366 --> 00:47:28.967]  But Vicente Fox is up here lobbying.
[00:47:29.327 --> 00:47:31.768]  We've gotten sub-sections from the few good Senators left.
[00:47:32.028 --> 00:47:33.189]  We know about the Z-Visa.
[00:47:33.389 --> 00:47:35.390]  It's the same thing Kennedy wrote five years ago.
[00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:36.651]  It's total amnesty.
[00:47:36.911 --> 00:47:38.472]  But the government says, no, no, no.
[00:47:38.732 --> 00:47:39.652]  Just trust us.
[00:47:39.812 --> 00:47:41.994]  Right here in Texas, oh, we're TxDOT.
[00:47:42.234 --> 00:47:46.576]  We say the legislature isn't allowed to see our agreement with a Spanish company.
[00:47:47.596 --> 00:47:48.497]  You're not allowed to.
[00:47:49.119 --> 00:47:56.327]  And then they sue the state and they sue members individually, the legislature, that put in requests to get the documents?
[00:47:56.888 --> 00:48:00.812]  I mean, folks, the legislature can't see the agreements?
[00:48:01.593 --> 00:48:03.996]  It's called Mexico or Russia.
[00:48:04.316 --> 00:48:06.959]  It's called things went bad, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:07.657 --> 00:48:11.418]  And I know we've got good firemen and good police and good people in the CIA and the FBI.
[00:48:11.579 --> 00:48:12.679]  You're not all corrupt yet.
[00:48:12.859 --> 00:48:16.140]  But the system is corrupt and they have you doing things that are corrupt.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:21.102]  And they brainwash you and tell you you're doing one thing for one reason when you're really doing it for another.
[00:48:21.462 --> 00:48:26.144]  And they tell you that you're supposed to manage us and run us and oversee us like we're children.
[00:48:26.524 --> 00:48:29.145]  And that you've all got to stick together.
[00:48:29.786 --> 00:48:31.986]  They don't tell you not to take those mercury filled shots.
[00:48:32.026 --> 00:48:35.268]  They don't tell you not to drink aspartame laden drinks.
[00:48:35.308 --> 00:48:36.068]  They don't tell you
[00:48:37.582 --> 00:48:39.804]  They tell you to give your children the HPV shot.
[00:48:40.024 --> 00:48:41.805]  They give you all this experimental bull.
[00:48:42.766 --> 00:48:44.887]  They don't care about you, you fools.
[00:48:45.627 --> 00:48:46.828]  And I'm talking to everybody out there.
[00:48:46.848 --> 00:48:49.390]  You need to be talked straight to for a change.
[00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:50.510]  I've read the documents.
[00:48:50.791 --> 00:48:51.811]  I know what's going on.
[00:48:52.151 --> 00:48:57.695]  I've got mainstream news and the government admitting they're using Al-Qaeda to attack Iran right now.
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:09.827]  And I know full well, it doesn't matter how many documents and how many admissions I've got, most of you out there who love this New World Order, because you think it's patriotic because they fooled you, they bait and switched you.
[00:49:09.867 --> 00:49:11.708]  Don't you understand it's camouflage?
[00:49:12.129 --> 00:49:15.191]  They tell you they're for you, they tell you they're patriotic.
[00:49:15.391 --> 00:49:20.214]  The people attacking Iraq are the same ones getting rid of our border and bringing in the North American Union.
[00:49:20.414 --> 00:49:21.995]  They're the ones killing America!
[00:49:22.676 --> 00:49:24.297]  They're the ones destroying our country!
[00:49:25.382 --> 00:49:26.123]  I gotta go quick here.
[00:49:26.143 --> 00:49:27.764]  I know we've had loaded phones since the start of the show.
[00:49:27.784 --> 00:49:29.065]  I don't know who's been holding the longest.
[00:49:29.105 --> 00:49:31.427]  I like that new phone system they got that told me how long they've been holding.
[00:49:31.507 --> 00:49:34.169]  I guess that one had a little bug or something.
[00:49:34.189 --> 00:49:35.129]  We're back to the old one here.
[00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:39.112]  Let's go ahead and talk to Laura in Ann Arbor.
[00:49:39.512 --> 00:49:40.433]  You're on the air.
[00:49:40.473 --> 00:49:40.954]  Go ahead.
[00:49:41.854 --> 00:49:42.395]  Hello, Alex.
[00:49:42.515 --> 00:49:42.735]  Hi.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:44.461]  Yeah, hi.
[00:49:44.601 --> 00:49:48.924]  I called because I wanted to report a black op exercise that took place in Ann Arbor.
[00:49:49.024 --> 00:49:49.785]  Sure, tell me about it.
[00:49:50.485 --> 00:49:52.487]  It happened about a week before Virginia Tech.
[00:49:52.587 --> 00:49:53.548]  I was on vacation.
[00:49:53.608 --> 00:49:55.389]  My colleague at work informed me.
[00:49:55.409 --> 00:49:58.892]  She's an independent... Oh yeah, Virginia was a total black op.
[00:49:59.552 --> 00:50:01.093]  It's got so many earmarks.
[00:50:01.334 --> 00:50:02.174]  I can't even get into it.
[00:50:02.214 --> 00:50:04.396]  It's just... Just don't believe me, folks.
[00:50:04.436 --> 00:50:04.996]  Trust the government.
[00:50:05.017 --> 00:50:05.517]  Everything's fine.
[00:50:06.232 --> 00:50:20.397]  Well, what happened was, she was coming home from work in Ann Arbor here, along a main street called Packard Road, where a lot of us, you know, drive around here, and she saw some operatives from, I guess, the ROTC.
[00:50:20.417 --> 00:50:22.038]  We found out they were from outside.
[00:50:22.098 --> 00:50:24.238]  They were having ROTC drills the week before.
[00:50:24.278 --> 00:50:32.781]  They put in cameras, had shooting drills, like, every week for six months before, and they were told to stand down for over three hours by the feds, who were, oh my God.
[00:50:33.001 --> 00:50:34.142]  But that's Virginia Tech.
[00:50:34.162 --> 00:50:34.402]  Go ahead.
[00:50:35.407 --> 00:50:37.130]  So, the rats had a black SUV.
[00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:40.937]  They had live automatic weapons, according to her.
[00:50:40.957 --> 00:50:43.802]  Yeah, they're using a lot of the teenagers because they don't know any better.
[00:50:44.435 --> 00:50:49.598]  She was so frightened by the whole thing, so rattled, that she called the AAPD.
[00:50:50.479 --> 00:50:51.319]  They sort of blew it off.
[00:50:51.339 --> 00:50:52.580]  They said, oh yeah, there they are.
[00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:53.781]  But see, that's what they're meant to do.
[00:50:53.801 --> 00:51:03.287]  You see, before they invaded Panama, they had drills for six months over and over again of black ops until finally the Panamanian Defense Force got used to it and thought it was another drill.
[00:51:03.327 --> 00:51:08.350]  And we've gotten Pentagon documents where they admit all of this is to acclimate us to the end of Posse Comitatus.
[00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:17.856]  That's why you go to the Kentucky Derby, you go to an NFL game, there's army troops, illegally, it's illegal, but they don't care, boys are now dictators who says they can, searching bags, but see, not the border.
[00:51:18.276 --> 00:51:20.978]  You see, it's all about acclimating and setting the precedent.
[00:51:21.278 --> 00:51:21.859]  What else happened?
[00:51:23.019 --> 00:51:29.023]  So, after she was blown off by the AAPD, she called the mayor, because she was just so freaked out.
[00:51:29.043 --> 00:51:30.684]  Tell you what, I want to hear how this ended, okay?
[00:51:30.924 --> 00:51:37.869]  Stay there, put you on hold, we'll come right back to you, and I'm going to blitz through all the other calls, and I'm going to get into Al-Qaeda.
[00:51:39.028 --> 00:51:39.689]  Al Qaeda!
[00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:42.091]  Running black ops for the U.S.
[00:51:42.111 --> 00:51:43.252]  government publicly.
[00:51:44.032 --> 00:51:45.874]  And I guess if you're not for Al Qaeda, you're not patriotic.
[00:51:45.894 --> 00:51:46.875]  Well, then I'm not patriotic.
[00:51:47.155 --> 00:51:48.336]  I will not serve Al Qaeda.
[00:51:50.899 --> 00:51:55.120]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.041]  Now you can do even more to hear Genesis shows in your area.

[00:52:24.649 --> 00:52:27.751]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[00:52:27.971 --> 00:52:35.556]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[00:52:35.616 --> 00:52:39.118]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.

[00:52:59.888 --> 00:53:00.449]  Hold on.
[00:53:01.449 --> 00:53:02.830]  He stands for truth.
[00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:06.051]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:07.412 --> 00:53:09.012]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:09.453 --> 00:53:12.194]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:13.154 --> 00:53:14.215]  Call Alex now.
[00:53:14.395 --> 00:53:16.015]  Toll free at 877-422-4222.
[00:53:17.646 --> 00:53:35.029]  Everything I'm going to tell you was top secret, but it's now public information.
[00:53:35.949 --> 00:53:44.791]  We're about to go to your calls, but later I'm going to get into the People's Mujahideen and other Al-Qaeda groups attacking the Iranians.
[00:53:46.224 --> 00:53:48.445]  And when Iran fights back, they're called Al-Qaeda.
[00:53:49.625 --> 00:53:56.666]  Remember, major committee chairmen of the war don't know the difference between Shia and Sunni or Kurd.
[00:53:58.147 --> 00:54:00.867]  I have spent years studying it and get confused by all of it.
[00:54:01.567 --> 00:54:03.488]  So that's why the Pentagon knows they can lie to us.
[00:54:05.428 --> 00:54:06.749]  It's unbelievable, folks.
[00:54:06.869 --> 00:54:08.109]  It's unbelievable.
[00:54:09.289 --> 00:54:12.230]  Al-Qaeda is the name of the CIA operation.
[00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:13.110]  It means the base.
[00:54:13.954 --> 00:54:17.622]  Because Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote about this in his new book that just came out last year.
[00:54:17.642 --> 00:54:22.954]  National Security Advisor, co-founder of the Trilateral Commission with David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger.
[00:54:26.435 --> 00:54:30.498]  In 1979, they actually had a plan to lure the Soviets into a war.
[00:54:31.039 --> 00:54:40.766]  People think the Soviets came in and the Mujahideen just popped up out of nowhere, who, by the way, follow the same Wahhabist ideas that Al-Qaeda does, and then Al-Qaeda was born out of that.
[00:54:41.186 --> 00:54:45.750]  So the CIA computer system and files were called Al-Qaeda.
[00:54:46.971 --> 00:54:52.875]  Now, the big joke was that means the outhouse, or the outdoor toilet, is the Arabic slang for that.
[00:54:53.527 --> 00:54:57.789]  I mean, if you were walking down the street and you said, I gotta go Al-Qaeda, they would understand.
[00:54:57.809 --> 00:55:04.571]  So it was also kind of a CIA joke with their linguist and different interpreters.
[00:55:05.192 --> 00:55:08.913]  But the original name was The Base, or The Foundation.
[00:55:10.146 --> 00:55:32.833]  Al-Qaeda is a CIA filename for radical Wahhabist fighters recruited in the 50s previously in anti-communist crusades to overthrow even pro-West governments like Mohammad Mozadek and Iran, but if they wouldn't give British Petroleum, then Anglo-American Oil, or Exxon Mobil or others, Exxon and Mobil separate at the time, wouldn't give them control.
[00:55:32.853 --> 00:55:33.334]  That was it.
[00:55:33.374 --> 00:55:34.374]  I mean, here comes Al-Qaeda.
[00:55:36.115 --> 00:55:39.478]  Calcutta, of course, then was funded by British intelligence arms.
[00:55:39.538 --> 00:55:41.999]  The Bin Laden family, the wealthiest family.
[00:55:42.019 --> 00:55:45.802]  They're more wealthy than the royalty in the House of Saad in Saudi Arabia.
[00:55:46.803 --> 00:55:49.165]  They, of course, go back to Lawrence of Arabia.
[00:55:49.185 --> 00:55:51.527]  I mean, these people are incredibly powerful.
[00:55:51.547 --> 00:55:53.048]  That's why they built every U.S.
[00:55:53.468 --> 00:55:54.689]  base in the Mideast.
[00:55:55.547 --> 00:56:00.971]  Because, and even into North Africa, some of the bases they had previously were built by the Bin Laden family.
[00:56:01.431 --> 00:56:03.412]  Very important British intelligence family.
[00:56:03.732 --> 00:56:08.335]  Going back to Lawrence of Arabia and strategic alliances made there.
[00:56:08.355 --> 00:56:09.196]  And everybody knows this.
[00:56:09.396 --> 00:56:15.220]  You've heard that Al-Qaeda's blowback and Al-Qaeda, you know, and Ron Paul saying Al-Qaeda's blowback and all that stuff.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:17.001]  It's a little bit worse than that.
[00:56:17.521 --> 00:56:20.824]  There's a Senate report in 1999 by the Republicans about how Bill Clinton sent 44
[00:56:22.236 --> 00:56:27.540]  Million plus dollars in one payment to Al Qaeda, to the Wahhabis to launch attacks in Serbia.
[00:56:27.921 --> 00:56:31.944]  When the Serbs fought back, they were called terrorists and said they were attacking innocent Muslims.
[00:56:32.524 --> 00:56:33.385]  Remember that?
[00:56:34.826 --> 00:56:37.688]  And those documents came out, and they're used over and over again.
[00:56:38.289 --> 00:56:45.695]  And so I thought I would go over the fact that this is mainstream AFP, French News Agency, BBC, but they report it dryly like it's... Well, I said I'd get into this later.
[00:56:45.955 --> 00:56:46.956]  Let's go to your calls right now.
[00:56:47.831 --> 00:56:50.432]  It's just that we knew this three years ago.
[00:56:50.452 --> 00:56:51.832]  They tried to overthrow Iran.
[00:56:51.852 --> 00:56:59.234]  There have been dams blown up, churches, mosques bombed, people shot all over the west of Iran and into the heartland of Iran.
[00:57:00.875 --> 00:57:02.315]  And also into the east of Iran.
[00:57:02.335 --> 00:57:06.157]  They've been attacking them from the north, the west, and the east.
[00:57:06.357 --> 00:57:07.337]  They're completely surrounded.
[00:57:09.045 --> 00:57:12.808]  And Cy Hirsch, of course, reported on this for New Yorker Magazine.
[00:57:13.108 --> 00:57:16.931]  It's now confirmed, London Telegraph, Bush sanctions black ops against Iran.
[00:57:17.411 --> 00:57:18.272]  And who are they using?
[00:57:18.432 --> 00:57:19.553]  Real live al-Qaeda.
[00:57:20.573 --> 00:57:23.375]  With our allies, the Saudis, who are the Wahhabis.
[00:57:24.216 --> 00:57:26.177]  So, there you go, that's how it works.
[00:57:26.698 --> 00:57:30.621]  But you try to tell that to the average American, who, folks, doesn't know anything.
[00:57:30.741 --> 00:57:30.961]  I mean,
[00:57:32.014 --> 00:57:33.035]  I'm not trying to be mean here.
[00:57:33.155 --> 00:57:41.881]  I talk to people who are specialized in computer programming, or engineering, or lobbying, or doctors, medical doctors.
[00:57:42.301 --> 00:57:51.528]  They know all about how to do a surgery, or how to look at a spreadsheet, but literally the public knows nothing!
[00:57:52.609 --> 00:57:54.350]  And they're just told this fantasy land!
[00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:55.831]  I'm going to get into it later.
[00:57:56.952 --> 00:58:00.814]  I mean, they've raided an Al-Qaeda base, and you read it's not even an Al-Qaeda group.
[00:58:02.364 --> 00:58:05.727]  I mean, it just never ends, folks, but they know you don't know.
[00:58:05.747 --> 00:58:07.428]  And they laugh at you.
[00:58:08.369 --> 00:58:09.290]  They laugh at you.
[00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:12.092]  Al-Qaeda is very real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:12.532 --> 00:58:18.917]  It's the name of a computer program, a computer database of Muslim provocateurs and government agents of the New World Order.
[00:58:19.598 --> 00:58:21.580]  And Al-Qaeda is attacking the world.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:22.580]  It is true.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.522]  And Al-Qaeda is the New World Order.
[00:58:25.211 --> 00:58:32.478]  They are just one little tentacle, ladies and gentlemen, of the people that are getting rid of our borders, destroying our dollar, and bringing in their one world government.
[00:58:32.859 --> 00:58:34.801]  Alright, let's just rampage through your calls real fast.
[00:58:35.161 --> 00:58:42.108]  Laura Ann Arbor, finish up your comment about you said black ops going on with ROTC and black suburbans running around with machine guns.
[00:58:42.348 --> 00:58:43.730]  They do this to condition the public.
[00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:44.851]  They don't even know why they're doing it.
[00:58:45.211 --> 00:59:01.967]  They're just told, go out and practice your taking over the post office, and the post office is pre-told, and then the public sees troops running around screaming, and a few role players screaming, I'm an American, please don't execute me, just so the public sees that, so when it really happens, every town, every city does it, the police will go, oh yeah, we heard about that until it's too late.
[00:59:02.487 --> 00:59:05.649]  Okay, this is for the Emperor, who now announced that he's a dictator.
[00:59:05.669 --> 00:59:06.770]  This is now official.
[00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:09.152]  If they decide to go with this, everyone's been conditioned.
[00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:10.432]  It's very scientifically done.
[00:59:10.452 --> 00:59:17.017]  It's called Pavlovian conditioning, operant conditioning, pre-conditioning, in a preparatory phase.
[00:59:17.737 --> 00:59:18.097]  Alright?
[00:59:19.939 --> 00:59:22.160]  Let me give you a simple analogy of that, or a simple example.
[00:59:23.241 --> 00:59:31.166]  Before the Nazis invaded Poland for over a year, every day they did drills on the border, and threatened to invade, and sent false radio signals that they were going to invade.
[00:59:31.658 --> 00:59:35.022]  They did the same thing when they broke the Maginot Line and smashed into France.
[00:59:35.342 --> 00:59:41.308]  Even after they knew the war was on, they kept telling them they were going to attack the main point in the line, in the traditional area where it was flat.
[00:59:41.328 --> 00:59:45.893]  Instead, he went through the Ardennes Forest.
[00:59:46.955 --> 00:59:48.076]  I'm sorry, it's just history.
[00:59:48.897 --> 00:59:49.858]  Tactician information.
[00:59:50.138 --> 00:59:51.078]  You might want to learn about it.
[00:59:51.318 --> 01:00:04.265]  We're having military programming launch status, and I have to sit here and see through it every day because I just so happened to get into history books when I was growing up instead of Pulp Fiction because I found out history was incredibly entertaining.
[01:00:04.725 --> 01:00:08.187]  I didn't know it meant it gave you those that don't know history doomed to repeat it.
[01:00:08.327 --> 01:00:10.028]  Well, if you know history, you know what's going to happen.
[01:00:10.808 --> 01:00:12.148]  And you can see what they're doing.
[01:00:12.188 --> 01:00:14.149]  We are under military attack!
[01:00:14.709 --> 01:00:18.090]  And the head of the Naval War College admits our military doesn't work for us.
[01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:19.391]  The troops think they do.
[01:00:20.091 --> 01:00:24.092]  But the generals are all CFR and they know, folks, they work for the foreign banks.
[01:00:24.272 --> 01:00:24.752]  Period!
[01:00:24.912 --> 01:00:25.813]  The country's gone!
[01:00:26.033 --> 01:00:26.493]  Mayday!
[01:00:26.693 --> 01:00:27.053]  Mayday!
[01:00:27.073 --> 01:00:27.873]  Do you understand me?
[01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:30.254]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:00:31.114 --> 01:00:31.775]  Let's go to them.
[01:00:32.055 --> 01:00:32.775]  Then we've got to go to Brighton.
[01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:33.575]  I'll come back and take more.
[01:00:33.935 --> 01:00:35.956]  Laura, finish up what you were saying from Ann Arbor, Michigan.
[01:00:35.976 --> 01:00:36.316]  Go ahead.
[01:00:37.245 --> 01:00:50.756]  Yeah, well what happened was when she called the mayor to report that these goons were down there on Packard with live weapons, they didn't even have that orange tape that said that they're fake arms or whatever, I don't know that much.
[01:00:50.776 --> 01:00:55.340]  You're lucky you didn't have Delta Force blowing up a police station next to you, but go ahead.
[01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:56.461]  I've got video of that, I'm sorry.
[01:00:57.060 --> 01:01:06.428]  He called her up two hours later to report that he found out it was an ROTC exercise, that he read them the riot act, told them they could never do that again in the city.
[01:01:06.989 --> 01:01:07.629]  Pure bull.
[01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:08.070]  Pure bull.
[01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:08.770]  He knew the whole time.
[01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:09.251]  They always do.
[01:01:10.204 --> 01:01:13.326]  Let me tell you what they did in Kingsville, and they do this all over.
[01:01:13.826 --> 01:01:20.749]  Back when Delta Force and the Night Stalkers out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky used to do this, and Delta Force out of Bragg, and of course the troops didn't know this.
[01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:24.952]  Now I've talked to a lot of Delta Force guys and guys that have gotten out, now they apologize and say they know I was right.
[01:01:24.992 --> 01:01:27.713]  They later saw PDD 25 declassified for them.
[01:01:27.753 --> 01:01:28.573]  It's for martial law.
[01:01:28.953 --> 01:01:29.834]  Now it's all public.
[01:01:30.174 --> 01:01:36.664]  But in Kingsville, next to Casa Ricarta Nursing Home, by the way, there was a heart attack and a lady had to go to the hospital and almost died from it.
[01:01:36.684 --> 01:01:37.966]  300 feet from Casa Ricarta.
[01:01:38.006 --> 01:01:38.387]  It's less than 300.
[01:01:38.547 --> 01:01:40.631]  It's like 200-something.
[01:01:40.671 --> 01:01:41.552]  It's in my film, Police State 2000.
[01:01:43.064 --> 01:01:49.089]  They come in, and the police had moved out the day before, done a secret deal to lease the police station because they wanted to do the test.
[01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:52.372]  They had army psychiatrists there doing tests with the public.
[01:01:52.612 --> 01:01:53.213]  They're observing.
[01:01:53.233 --> 01:01:56.275]  They tapped the phones locally to see what kind of fear it would create.
[01:01:56.596 --> 01:01:59.979]  And then Delta Force hit, blew up the old police station.
[01:02:00.019 --> 01:02:03.041]  I mean, fire, explosions, troops running around screaming.
[01:02:03.602 --> 01:02:05.423]  And right next to a nursing home.
[01:02:05.784 --> 01:02:09.487]  All done to do psychological testing to see how we'd respond, ma'am.
[01:02:10.342 --> 01:02:11.443]  I appreciate your call.
[01:02:11.964 --> 01:02:13.385]  This is what we're facing.
[01:02:13.825 --> 01:02:15.347]  I've been to the FEMA camps.
[01:02:15.787 --> 01:02:16.888]  I've seen the documents.
[01:02:16.908 --> 01:02:17.769]  They're now public.
[01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:19.690]  Bush has announced himself dictator.
[01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:22.953]  They'll probably just hand power over to Hillary and they'll move forward.
[01:02:22.993 --> 01:02:24.755]  Then the Democrats will love Marshall Long.
[01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:27.132]  You want tyranny, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:02:27.392 --> 01:02:28.052]  You're gonna get it.
[01:02:28.693 --> 01:02:31.895]  Unless you wake up now and get angry and get serious.
[01:02:32.356 --> 01:02:33.457]  This show is real.
[01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:34.958]  These issues are real.
[01:02:35.258 --> 01:02:39.081]  Your calls and our government controlling Al-Qaeda on the other side.
[01:02:39.281 --> 01:02:40.422]  Because it's not our government.
[01:02:54.907 --> 01:03:00.414]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:00.775 --> 01:03:08.404]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:03:09.099 --> 01:03:16.162]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:03:16.562 --> 01:03:27.947]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:03:28.287 --> 01:03:31.889]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:03:32.249 --> 01:03:34.190]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:38.372]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:03:51.653 --> 01:03:55.556]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:03:55.776 --> 01:04:08.066]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:04:08.487 --> 01:04:08.887]  The U.S.
[01:04:08.927 --> 01:04:14.512]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:04:14.912 --> 01:04:17.134]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:04:18.995 --> 01:04:20.056]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:04:20.076 --> 01:04:22.917]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:04:23.037 --> 01:04:29.080]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.842]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:04:32.922 --> 01:04:39.265]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:04:39.805 --> 01:04:44.726]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:04:45.387 --> 01:04:46.507]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:04:46.907 --> 01:04:47.447]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:57.770]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[01:04:58.270 --> 01:05:00.051]  Sure, you've got a mortgage and credit cards.
[01:05:00.351 --> 01:05:03.512]  Your debt creation is probably the smartest thing you've ever done.
[01:05:03.932 --> 01:05:05.552]  How would it be to find $75,000, $150,000, $200,000 or more you never knew you had?
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:13.363]  Now the task force has strategies to make these debts into virtual savings accounts.
[01:05:13.903 --> 01:05:16.225]  Ben Franklin said, a penny saved is a penny earned.
[01:05:16.865 --> 01:05:25.331]  By doing nothing more than you're doing right now, because you've used your credit, the right strategies can make the debt part of your financial life the smartest thing you've ever done.
[01:05:25.851 --> 01:05:28.573]  Oh, by the way, your strategies cost you nothing out of pocket.
[01:05:29.214 --> 01:05:31.996]  Go ahead and check out the debt elimination scams if you'd like to.
[01:05:32.536 --> 01:05:36.999]  You wouldn't take money from a loan shark, so you may not want to give your money to a debt shark.

[01:05:51.673 --> 01:05:54.415]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[01:05:54.855 --> 01:05:57.157]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[01:05:57.437 --> 01:06:00.519]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[01:06:00.999 --> 01:06:03.140]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.701]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[01:06:04.962 --> 01:06:09.084]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:12.526]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[01:06:12.827 --> 01:06:14.067]  With more than 500 vital functions.
[01:06:15.288 --> 01:06:23.551]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.

[01:06:41.239 --> 01:06:42.761]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:46.364]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:07:02.808 --> 01:07:04.170]  Raging for the truth.
[01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:06.051]  Exposing corruption.
[01:07:06.792 --> 01:07:09.996]  Dismantling the false left-right paradigm.
[01:07:10.456 --> 01:07:12.018]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:07:13.079 --> 01:07:14.460]  Alright, let's blast through your calls.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:18.304]  I've got to get into how Al-Qaeda, working with the globalists, are attacking the Iranians.
[01:07:18.644 --> 01:07:20.767]  Give the Iranians fight back, they'll be called Al-Qaeda.
[01:07:21.427 --> 01:07:21.988]  Not joking.
[01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:27.174]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Tim in Chicago.
[01:07:27.754 --> 01:07:28.615]  Tim, thanks for holding.
[01:07:28.635 --> 01:07:29.255]  You're on the air.
[01:07:29.335 --> 01:07:29.736]  Go ahead.
[01:07:30.216 --> 01:07:30.636]  Hey, Alex.
[01:07:30.676 --> 01:07:31.317]  Happy holidays.
[01:07:31.677 --> 01:07:33.018]  Happy holidays to you, my friend.
[01:07:33.298 --> 01:07:34.580]  I am actually taking off tomorrow.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.961]  I have a rare day off, but go ahead.
[01:07:36.261 --> 01:07:36.501]  Nice.
[01:07:36.681 --> 01:07:44.928]  I just want to let you know about a film I saw the other day called Bug, which makes numerous references to New World Order and other conspiracy theories like Bilderberg.
[01:07:46.087 --> 01:07:49.451]  Well, I mean, I don't watch TV, per se, but I do watch all the clips.
[01:07:49.611 --> 01:07:50.712]  People aggregate it for me.
[01:07:50.752 --> 01:07:51.372]  I'm really lucky.
[01:07:51.733 --> 01:07:56.277]  I guess, you know, that's what's great about the web, but, like, The Family Guy and then The Simpsons.
[01:07:56.297 --> 01:08:00.722]  Like, every episode, it's all about the Bilderbergs and the New World Order, but it's all a big joke, kind of an acclamation.
[01:08:01.576 --> 01:08:02.716]  Yeah, this is actually in theaters.
[01:08:02.816 --> 01:08:06.417]  It's got a sandwich between Shrek 3 and Pirates of the Caribbean.
[01:08:06.477 --> 01:08:07.157]  Well, tell me about it.
[01:08:07.197 --> 01:08:07.637]  What's it about?
[01:08:08.598 --> 01:08:25.862]  It's essentially this guy is an escapee from a hospital in Groom Lake and believes he has a mental implant in his head and he says he was also a partner of Timothy McVeigh and he finds Ashley Judd and they slowly go crazy believing that they have bugs all over them.
[01:08:26.142 --> 01:08:27.402]  And so what happens in the end?
[01:08:28.312 --> 01:08:30.153]  Uh, they light themselves on fire at gasoline.
[01:08:30.594 --> 01:08:32.575]  And they're crazy and it doesn't exist, right?
[01:08:32.655 --> 01:08:32.895]  Right.
[01:08:33.295 --> 01:08:35.076]  Yeah, well, I mean, that's just government propaganda.
[01:08:35.877 --> 01:08:39.139]  See, now, if you go, oh, go to the White House website, Bush is now a dictator.
[01:08:39.299 --> 01:08:41.260]  They go, oh, set yourself on fire, huh?
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.081]  Hey, uh, the government's saying everything's secret now.
[01:08:44.122 --> 01:08:48.764]  They're handing over the infrastructure, the water, the roads to foreign companies without them even having to pay any money.
[01:08:48.984 --> 01:08:49.745]  We've been sold out.
[01:08:50.025 --> 01:08:53.767]  Oh, and next you'll tell me Bigfoot was at your bar mitzvah.
[01:08:54.207 --> 01:08:56.669]  You know, I mean, it's just, this is how they operate.
[01:08:57.493 --> 01:08:59.935]  And, uh, it's just, we're in a lot of trouble.
[01:08:59.955 --> 01:09:02.617]  It's, look, it's Pentagon warfare operations.
[01:09:02.937 --> 01:09:03.377]  Period.
[01:09:05.019 --> 01:09:06.600]  So you believe this whole film's a psyop?
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.301]  I haven't seen it, so I don't know, sir.
[01:09:08.341 --> 01:09:10.262]  I'm telling you from your description of it.
[01:09:11.083 --> 01:09:12.984]  That sounds like a complete and total psyop.
[01:09:13.725 --> 01:09:15.907]  But a lot of it is, people don't even have to be in the psyop.
[01:09:15.947 --> 01:09:17.668]  They just know, a lot of people are smart.
[01:09:17.688 --> 01:09:19.849]  A lot of people know about the New World Order now, and they've told me.
[01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:21.010]  Hey, I decided to join it.
[01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:22.491]  Yeah, you're right, Alex, it's all evil.
[01:09:22.832 --> 01:09:23.992]  And I'm deciding to work for them.
[01:09:24.693 --> 01:09:26.154]  I'm just like, oh my God.
[01:09:26.855 --> 01:09:30.876]  I can't tell you how many times I've had the former Speaker of the House walk up to me on the Greenbelt and I was like, oh I know you.
[01:09:31.277 --> 01:09:33.837]  He's like, this is like six or seven years ago, he goes, why don't you just join us Alex?
[01:09:34.077 --> 01:09:38.819]  The public doesn't care, they want to be slaves, they're dumb, you're not going to be able to help them.
[01:09:39.559 --> 01:09:40.860]  Compromise, join us.
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:47.082]  Compromise, and then you can do a little bit of good in the power structure, or you can have no input.
[01:09:47.602 --> 01:09:50.303]  See, and that's the devilish way they twist things.
[01:09:51.047 --> 01:09:58.488]  And I've repeatedly, when they've come to me to sell out, and I've had one of the biggest radio networks in the country years ago approach me and want me to sell out.
[01:09:59.709 --> 01:10:01.549]  And I mean, it's right out in the open, folks.
[01:10:01.609 --> 01:10:03.429]  I mean, we want you to sell out.
[01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:06.750]  And they don't even make bones about it.
[01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:16.012]  And of course, before you even talk to them, you've got to sign agreements not to talk about what you... Plus, I'm not going to sit there and burn a bunch of people that have said that, because, you know, later things may change and things, you know, I don't burn bridges.
[01:10:17.190 --> 01:10:19.674]  I'm just telling you folks, the New World Order is real, okay?
[01:10:19.754 --> 01:10:22.017]  I mean, I've been threatened, hey, we're gonna kill you if you don't shut up.
[01:10:22.057 --> 01:10:25.602]  I've been approached, hey, here's over a million dollar contract a year, we want you to shut up.
[01:10:26.394 --> 01:10:27.455]  No more New World Order.
[01:10:27.475 --> 01:10:28.636]  No more black helicopters.
[01:10:28.676 --> 01:10:29.637]  No more Federal Reserve.
[01:10:29.897 --> 01:10:31.679]  We want you to be kind of a mainline conservative.
[01:10:31.739 --> 01:10:33.580]  You really come across on the radio.
[01:10:33.821 --> 01:10:35.362]  We want to give you a national TV show.
[01:10:35.562 --> 01:10:42.168]  Oh, I've also been approached multiple times by, not just the TV developers, but by vice presidents, okay?
[01:10:42.548 --> 01:10:44.030]  Or by the heads of development.
[01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:45.671]  The heads of... I never talk about this stuff.
[01:10:46.011 --> 01:10:46.972]  And it's just point blank.
[01:10:47.773 --> 01:10:50.515]  Hey man, you know, there's a lot of problems in government.
[01:10:50.535 --> 01:10:51.136]  It's not perfect.
[01:10:51.156 --> 01:10:52.117]  We've got to manage things.
[01:10:52.397 --> 01:10:53.478]  You know how dumb they are.
[01:10:54.756 --> 01:10:59.039]  And see, they talk to people who understand what they're doing, like, okay, you're one of us, so you understand.
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:00.961]  And see, they don't care about your health.
[01:11:01.281 --> 01:11:02.262]  They don't even understand you.
[01:11:02.682 --> 01:11:03.643]  Well, see, I'm not that smart.
[01:11:03.663 --> 01:11:07.866]  I'm not a sardonic, up on a high and mighty, you know, view of myself.
[01:11:09.272 --> 01:11:13.015]  And yeah, I know there's a lot of dumb people and a lot of people who... But you know what?
[01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:15.157]  There's a lot of good innocent people being hurt by this system.
[01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:21.102]  But they know that people who are aware of things get sick of being treated badly by the general public.
[01:11:21.302 --> 01:11:23.584]  And so they come to me and they say, don't they laugh at you?
[01:11:24.004 --> 01:11:25.645]  They don't appreciate what you're saying.
[01:11:26.005 --> 01:11:27.967]  See, they don't want your help, Mr. Jones.
[01:11:29.088 --> 01:11:30.829]  I mean, it's so devilish, folks.
[01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:31.770]  So devilish.
[01:11:32.731 --> 01:11:34.612]  To be approached, to be offered the deals.
[01:11:35.253 --> 01:11:37.755]  I mean, it's happened... I forget how many times now.
[01:11:38.889 --> 01:11:54.921]  But, you know, a long time ago, I would go get on the airplane and fly and meet in the big, you know, top of the big office building, you know, there in the giant office with the, you know, the rest of them would go to the cocktail parties or, you know, have them go, hey, you like these young ladies?
[01:11:54.941 --> 01:11:55.902]  Why don't you go have a good time?
[01:11:55.922 --> 01:12:00.465]  I mean, folks, I've been there when the new old order is trying to put whores on me, okay?
[01:12:00.745 --> 01:12:03.327]  And I mean, I'm talking women that are tens.
[01:12:04.025 --> 01:12:06.286]  Alright, folks, it's real, okay?
[01:12:06.906 --> 01:12:10.207]  Okay, I've had meetings with the devil, as they say, repeatedly.
[01:12:10.867 --> 01:12:12.687]  This stuff is not a joke, okay?
[01:12:13.167 --> 01:12:15.248]  It's one thing to visit her and tell you all this stuff goes on.
[01:12:15.488 --> 01:12:16.868]  Let me just tell you how the world really works.
[01:12:16.988 --> 01:12:17.709]  It's real, folks.
[01:12:17.969 --> 01:12:19.969]  I've been approached repeatedly by them.
[01:12:21.169 --> 01:12:21.490]  Okay?
[01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:26.751]  And, uh, so many people cannot say no.
[01:12:26.831 --> 01:12:30.752]  To me, you know, uh, my wife and family are what matters.
[01:12:31.778 --> 01:12:35.385]  And bimbos don't, and fancy cars.
[01:12:35.946 --> 01:12:43.238]  What does a Lamborghini and a $10 million house mean if you're not free and you don't help people and you don't do good things?
[01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:44.561]  And they go, well, you're a sap.
[01:12:45.718 --> 01:12:57.266]  No, I'm somebody who is into building things, and creating, and writing, and loving, and swimming, and looking at the stars at night, and walking in the woods.
[01:12:57.326 --> 01:12:58.847]  That's valuable to me.
[01:12:59.087 --> 01:13:00.248]  That's treasure to me.
[01:13:00.808 --> 01:13:02.930]  Okay, and not selling out, and being strong.
[01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:05.191]  That's important to me, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:09.374]  But to the rest of the world, they're into the transitory things of the flesh.
[01:13:09.921 --> 01:13:11.602]  And I'm not saying the flesh is bad.
[01:13:11.642 --> 01:13:12.483]  I mean, there's a place for it.
[01:13:12.783 --> 01:13:17.105]  I'm not saying that having a nice car is bad, or having a nice house is bad.
[01:13:17.266 --> 01:13:21.208]  But when that goes first, when that comes first, that's all you can think about.
[01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:27.752]  I mean, frankly, it's sick!
[01:13:29.113 --> 01:13:34.276]  And when you'll sell out your country, and you'll sell out, you've got to stand for something or fall for anything, as the old country song goes.
[01:13:34.316 --> 01:13:35.297]  We ought to add that into the lineup.
[01:13:35.317 --> 01:13:37.958]  You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything.
[01:13:38.279 --> 01:13:38.759]  It's true!
[01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:50.710]  And by the way, when you're in a society where you only care about yourself, when you're in a society where you don't help your neighbor because, well, how does that help you get ahead?
[01:13:50.730 --> 01:13:51.411]  You're cold-blooded.
[01:13:51.731 --> 01:13:55.014]  That actually makes your life a terrible place to live.
[01:13:55.454 --> 01:13:57.035]  That makes the world a worse place to live.
[01:13:57.275 --> 01:13:58.897]  Because then your neighbor is going to have the same attitude.
[01:13:58.917 --> 01:14:00.378]  They're not going to help you when you need help.
[01:14:01.639 --> 01:14:07.203]  Every few days I hear about some old man mugged and shot and left to bleed to death for three hours in the street in Detroit.
[01:14:08.132 --> 01:14:15.861]  I remember years ago at Austin, a cop got run over at the corner of William Cannon and I-35, up there by that Tiger Mart, and he was there for almost an hour.
[01:14:15.941 --> 01:14:16.682]  Nobody helped him.
[01:14:16.983 --> 01:14:18.064]  And fire ants killed him.
[01:14:19.926 --> 01:14:24.652]  I mean, frankly, I don't like the fact that cops think they're God and think I'm their slave and they're brainwashed.
[01:14:24.712 --> 01:14:25.773]  I feel sorry for most of them.
[01:14:25.793 --> 01:14:26.574]  I know a lot of them are good.
[01:14:27.034 --> 01:14:28.136]  But I mean, I'd help them.
[01:14:31.468 --> 01:14:33.309]  You know, I mean, what's happened to us?
[01:14:34.149 --> 01:15:01.180]  I saw a story a few years ago up in Toronto, these are just some of the worst stories, where this young woman was beaten to the head by the pipe, they thought it was a lead pipe, they thought it did it, raped, and she was on a major street, I mean a major boulevard, with just a shirt on, raped, bleeding, she went into a coma, last time I heard it looked like she was going to die, I need to look back into that, but it said that the CEO of a major telecommunications company on the fifth floor above was looking at her and laughing, and called his office in to look, and he said, let's call the cops, he said, oh no, we don't need the trouble, get back to work.
[01:15:03.192 --> 01:15:06.996]  A woman is bleeding with her head beat in naked on a major sidewalk.
[01:15:07.016 --> 01:15:08.177]  People just walk right past her.
[01:15:08.638 --> 01:15:12.562]  Folks, I went to a swim meet this weekend with my children.
[01:15:13.483 --> 01:15:14.444]  And I watched the children.
[01:15:15.144 --> 01:15:18.408]  None of them hardly were talking to each other or playing Cowboys and Indians.
[01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:21.451]  They were playing Game Boys or they were text messaging each other.
[01:15:21.651 --> 01:15:23.493]  They're already interfacing the false reality.
[01:15:24.914 --> 01:15:25.235]  You see?
[01:15:26.124 --> 01:15:30.225]  And all this evil is breeding around you while you're busy worrying about yourself, thinking about yourself.
[01:15:30.405 --> 01:15:32.146]  You're going to end up losing everything you've got.
[01:15:32.186 --> 01:15:33.546]  Your house, your car, everything.
[01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:35.787]  Because you didn't care about anything but it.
[01:15:36.687 --> 01:15:38.967]  Those that were willing to give up their lives, gained their lives.
[01:15:39.007 --> 01:15:41.808]  Those that tried to save their lives, lost their lives.
[01:15:42.308 --> 01:15:43.509]  Think Jesus told us that.
[01:15:43.829 --> 01:15:46.189]  Your calls and the news straight ahead.
[01:15:51.972 --> 01:15:54.914]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:15:55.074 --> 01:16:00.238]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:05.942]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:16:06.322 --> 01:16:07.403]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:16:07.783 --> 01:16:16.588]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[01:17:57.850 --> 01:18:00.171]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[01:18:00.451 --> 01:18:03.712]  That's why you need SFR's Protect-A synthetic oil treatments.

[01:18:33.814 --> 01:18:34.274]  I think so.
[01:18:53.402 --> 01:18:57.505]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:18:57.745 --> 01:18:59.507]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:18:59.767 --> 01:19:06.051]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:19:06.352 --> 01:19:12.476]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:19:12.716 --> 01:19:14.838]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses
[01:19:14.838 --> 01:19:15.258]  I think so.
[01:19:37.325 --> 01:19:39.287]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:20:10.861 --> 01:20:14.682]  Alright, this is out of control.
[01:20:14.702 --> 01:20:15.663]  Let's get to your calls.
[01:20:16.783 --> 01:20:26.107]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Memphis and Carl, Laura, TJ, David, that's spelled right, Rand, and others.
[01:20:26.187 --> 01:20:27.768]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Memphis.
[01:20:27.988 --> 01:20:29.128]  You're on the air, Chris, go ahead.
[01:20:29.709 --> 01:20:30.689]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:20:30.769 --> 01:20:30.989]  Good.
[01:20:31.029 --> 01:20:32.050]  Happy holiday to you.
[01:20:32.210 --> 01:20:32.530]  Thank you.
[01:20:33.135 --> 01:20:42.186]  I just wanted to let you know I'm a first time caller and I have been watching all of your videos, listening to every radio show that you do and I think you are just awesome man.
[01:20:42.806 --> 01:20:51.677]  My concern that I was talking about with some friends of mine about the 9-11 truth movement is that I'm trying to reach a lot of minority people and they seem to have
[01:20:52.407 --> 01:20:55.888]  Still a slave mentality to be blind as to what the truth is.
[01:20:56.428 --> 01:21:00.429]  You know, and I'm working on creating my own blog to get this information out.
[01:21:00.749 --> 01:21:02.689]  But how do I get through to them even harder?
[01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:18.073]  I gotta tell you, I have found 9-11 Truths to be received across the communities, particularly by black Americans because they've seen Tuskegee and the experiments and just a few years ago it came out in New York City, testing pesticides on black children until death.
[01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:21.534]  That was New York Daily News even reported on that, strapping them down, killing them.
[01:21:22.274 --> 01:21:24.737]  By the way, before you roll your eyes, listeners, go look it up.
[01:21:24.937 --> 01:21:25.697]  Believe me, it's true.
[01:21:25.737 --> 01:21:26.338]  I wish it wasn't.
[01:21:27.339 --> 01:21:34.785]  There are certain areas, you are right in the belly of the South, and folks get scared sometimes.
[01:21:34.806 --> 01:21:36.487]  There's also a lot of courage.
[01:21:36.807 --> 01:21:38.369]  Also have the yin and yang of that, the fear.
[01:21:39.089 --> 01:21:42.430]  And, uh, you know, it's kind of fun to be afraid of Al-Qaeda, the boogeyman.
[01:21:42.891 --> 01:21:52.794]  And so you just got to reach out to those folks and, uh, you know, and also their preachers are probably teaching them that right out of their World Council of Churches, right down to the local denominations to go along with the fantasy.
[01:21:53.094 --> 01:21:56.235]  See, they're listening to neocon fake Christian talk radio.
[01:21:56.456 --> 01:21:57.596]  It's probably the folks you're talking to.
[01:21:58.351 --> 01:21:59.373]  Uh huh, exactly.
[01:22:11.684 --> 01:22:12.824]  Mm-hmm, exactly.
[01:22:13.225 --> 01:22:13.665]  Exactly.
[01:22:13.705 --> 01:22:15.665]  That's why I pass out flyers every day.
[01:22:15.765 --> 01:22:18.346]  That's why I send out emails to people I know.
[01:22:18.386 --> 01:22:23.128]  Listen, we already stopped the New World Order from carrying out more terror attacks in the last six years.
[01:22:23.188 --> 01:22:27.129]  If we don't get the word out now, they're going to go ahead and go a nuke.
[01:22:27.169 --> 01:22:28.310]  They said a nuke will go off.
[01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:29.770]  I mean, they could do anything right now.
[01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:31.771]  This is life and death, my friend, so good job.
[01:22:32.251 --> 01:22:32.672]  Thank you.
[01:22:32.812 --> 01:22:33.272]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:22:33.612 --> 01:22:33.893]  You bet.
[01:22:33.913 --> 01:22:34.393]  Thank you, sir.
[01:22:34.413 --> 01:22:35.134]  Good to hear from you.
[01:22:35.534 --> 01:22:38.056]  Okay, I'd love to talk to all of you for hours, but I've got to get to everybody here.
[01:22:38.717 --> 01:22:41.939]  Let's go ahead and talk to Daveed in New York.
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:43.601]  You are on the air.
[01:22:43.781 --> 01:22:44.882]  Welcome to the airwaves.
[01:22:44.902 --> 01:22:46.683]  Hey, this is Daveed.
[01:22:46.883 --> 01:22:47.764]  Okay, Daveed.
[01:22:47.784 --> 01:22:48.565]  They told me Daveed.
[01:22:48.645 --> 01:22:49.346]  Go ahead, Daveed.
[01:22:50.086 --> 01:22:51.627]  Yeah, I want to talk about the Internet Zone.
[01:22:52.748 --> 01:22:59.334]  My brother who's in Iraq right now, he's a soldier, they sent me two screenshots of a video game magazine promoting the Internet Zone.
[01:23:00.675 --> 01:23:01.075]  Yeah, I know.
[01:23:01.135 --> 01:23:04.838]  Internet phones, voice over IPs are a pretty neat thing.
[01:23:05.518 --> 01:23:06.219]  What's going on?
[01:23:07.319 --> 01:23:08.660]  What, have you heard of the Internet Phone?
[01:23:10.041 --> 01:23:12.022]  Internet Phone, yeah.
[01:23:12.182 --> 01:23:13.223]  Internet Phone, number 4.
[01:23:13.964 --> 01:23:14.844]  Oh, Internet 2.
[01:23:14.944 --> 01:23:18.326]  Yeah, that's a private network set up with the government and private industry.
[01:23:18.386 --> 01:23:23.349]  They're going to shut down the old hubs and get rid of the mainline internet and claim it failed.
[01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:25.131]  That's their official corporate minutes.
[01:23:25.391 --> 01:23:27.052]  They had an Internet 2 meeting in Austin.
[01:23:27.772 --> 01:23:30.234]  A year ago, they had one in London three years ago.
[01:23:30.534 --> 01:23:32.155]  Type in the internet is dead.
[01:23:32.355 --> 01:23:33.936]  That's always the press release they put out.
[01:23:34.156 --> 01:23:43.321]  So the way they're going to hijack the existing web is shut off the main hubs, not upgraded, then have peer-to-peer data transfer disputes.
[01:23:43.521 --> 01:23:45.963]  Telecommunications companies spent $150 million plus dollars
[01:23:48.624 --> 01:23:55.312]  In 2006 alone, trying to lobby to quote, end internet net neutrality, that will officially kill the web.
[01:23:55.532 --> 01:24:01.339]  They failed only by just a few votes, because the committee chairman pushing it, literally knew nothing about the internet.
[01:24:01.359 --> 01:24:06.665]  Remember, talk about the group of tubes, the collection of tubes, you dump things on it.
[01:24:07.425 --> 01:24:13.207]  Uh, of course he's now enrolled in a big corruption scandal, as they all should be, except for Ron Paul and a few others.
[01:24:13.267 --> 01:24:14.268]  But, uh, go ahead.
[01:24:14.328 --> 01:24:15.408]  So he loves Internet, too.
[01:24:15.448 --> 01:24:19.970]  Yeah, they're trying to get the Tribs on a contained net, so they can't learn the truth, but it's already too late.
[01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:26.313]  Yeah, well, then Video Game Magazine is promoting Internet to, you know, to people who play video games.
[01:24:26.333 --> 01:24:27.393]  Well, of course the government is.
[01:24:27.433 --> 01:24:30.974]  Yeah, oh yeah, and of course the Internet, uh, of course the video game companies are.
[01:24:31.335 --> 01:24:32.175]  They want to get you, look,
[01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:35.259]  There's 50 universities, 50 corporations.
[01:24:35.299 --> 01:24:35.961]  They're going to run it.
[01:24:35.981 --> 01:24:37.848]  They're already starting to kill the net right now.
[01:24:38.610 --> 01:24:41.892]  And then they'll tell you they're trying to save it when they shift you over to this thing.
[01:24:42.012 --> 01:24:44.894]  You'll have to register, you'll have to pay, you'll have IP tracking.
[01:24:45.255 --> 01:24:51.018]  That's why they're busy demon... Look, the newspapers are all dying, radio and TV are imploding, unless they're shows like this.
[01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:53.720]  Literally, that's the only one still growing, or even holding.
[01:24:54.681 --> 01:24:55.381]  They're panicking!
[01:24:55.401 --> 01:25:00.345]  You think they're going to let people like me come in and eat their lunch with the truth?
[01:25:00.465 --> 01:25:00.685]  No!
[01:25:00.705 --> 01:25:06.749]  They want a bunch of these candy-butted fakes sitting there, lying the American people into hell on earth!
[01:25:07.699 --> 01:25:09.441]  They're not playing it, but let me tell you something, New World Order.
[01:25:09.461 --> 01:25:09.962]  It's too late.
[01:25:09.982 --> 01:25:11.184]  You can kill people like me.
[01:25:11.424 --> 01:25:12.225]  You can shut us down.
[01:25:12.245 --> 01:25:13.066]  You can put us in prison.
[01:25:13.226 --> 01:25:14.328]  You can shut the web off.
[01:25:14.508 --> 01:25:15.870]  The people got a taste of truth.
[01:25:16.251 --> 01:25:21.618]  It's too late, and there's nothing on earth you can do to stop this information warfare migration.
[01:25:22.018 --> 01:25:22.599]  There is nothing
[01:25:22.619 --> 01:25:24.461]  Nothing on earth you can do to stop it.
[01:25:24.741 --> 01:25:28.264]  All you can do is run on a little bit further, like Johnny Cash said.
[01:25:28.284 --> 01:25:29.185]  We ought to add that to the music.
[01:25:29.385 --> 01:25:31.427]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:25:31.587 --> 01:25:36.112]  You can run on for a long time, but sooner or later, they're going to cut you down.
[01:25:36.432 --> 01:25:38.894]  Sooner or later, God's going to cut you down.
[01:25:39.275 --> 01:25:46.862]  Remember it, and know it, and bank it, because I know in my soul, in my heart, in my mind, in my intellect, that tyranny will fall.
[01:25:47.282 --> 01:25:58.688]  Humanity's too good, the human spirit's too strong, God's shining light energizing us is too powerful, and the New World Order was destined from the foundations of Earth to FAIL!
[01:25:58.708 --> 01:26:04.972]  Let's go ahead and jam in some more calls where I come in with a final segment news blitz.
[01:26:05.572 --> 01:26:08.634]  Let's talk to TJ in New York, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:26:09.074 --> 01:26:10.034]  How you doing today, Alec?
[01:26:10.094 --> 01:26:11.935]  I'm fired up, born again hard.
[01:26:11.955 --> 01:26:12.956]  I hear ya.
[01:26:13.016 --> 01:26:16.538]  I gave you a call to give you an update on the ever-growing martial law and police state in New York.
[01:26:17.409 --> 01:26:22.400]  Now, military will be stationed in over 13 pad stations between New York and New Jersey.
[01:26:23.141 --> 01:26:27.651]  And very soon, New Yorkers can look forward to riding the subway along with the National Guard.
[01:26:28.405 --> 01:26:31.886]  Yeah, and they got to search you, all for training, but the border stays wide open.
[01:26:31.906 --> 01:26:42.329]  And I saw an article in New York State, where the New York City Police don't arrest illegals for not having driver's licenses or insurance, but they arrest citizens that have been told to have maximum zero tolerance, because we're the dumb cattle.
[01:26:42.529 --> 01:26:45.370]  We're the American people, the schlubs that think we're free.
[01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:48.331]  None were so enslaved as those that thought they were free.
[01:26:48.811 --> 01:26:49.371]  And we're not.
[01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:51.906]  It's time people start waking up, Alex.
[01:26:51.946 --> 01:26:53.626]  They're slowly moving the control grid in.
[01:26:53.706 --> 01:26:54.266]  Hey, don't worry.
[01:26:54.286 --> 01:26:57.087]  When they take all their bank accounts and everything they got, they're gonna wake up.
[01:26:57.107 --> 01:27:00.148]  That's why they want the police state in place first, to try to suppress that.
[01:27:01.068 --> 01:27:01.729]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:04.189]  So when everyone gets up and rolling, they're already there to take control.
[01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:05.650]  That's right, boys and girls.
[01:27:06.030 --> 01:27:07.871]  And a lot of you have done this through your life.
[01:27:07.911 --> 01:27:10.792]  You go suck up to the system, thinking that's how you get ahead.
[01:27:11.672 --> 01:27:15.113]  It's fine to suck up to the system if it isn't evil, and if it isn't immoral.
[01:27:16.095 --> 01:27:19.017]  But once you start compromising, that way leads into destruction.
[01:27:19.197 --> 01:27:26.001]  What do you think is going to happen to a nation of sheep that always say yes, and always go along, and don't have a rule of law, and let corruption run rampant?
[01:27:26.161 --> 01:27:27.181]  You think you're really safe?
[01:27:27.401 --> 01:27:28.622]  You think your children are safe?
[01:27:28.802 --> 01:27:30.283]  You think your grandchildren are safe?
[01:27:32.484 --> 01:27:36.646]  I'm having to strongly consider evacuating this country, at least evacuating my family.
[01:27:37.027 --> 01:27:38.187]  Now I've said I'll stay and fight.
[01:27:38.547 --> 01:27:40.569]  And I see people waking up and taking action, so I am.
[01:27:41.129 --> 01:27:44.891]  But if I see much more out of this dictator, I will evacuate my family.
[01:27:45.549 --> 01:27:47.196]  You understand folks, it's that bad.
[01:27:47.537 --> 01:27:47.839]  Okay?
[01:27:47.979 --> 01:27:49.987]  We've reached evacuation point level.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.341]  This is not a joke.
[01:27:52.561 --> 01:27:53.642]  This is not a game.
[01:27:53.842 --> 01:27:54.863]  This is not a drill.
[01:27:55.184 --> 01:27:55.984]  This is tyranny.
[01:27:56.325 --> 01:27:58.627]  Hardcore mortal combat against America.
[01:27:58.867 --> 01:27:59.488]  The U.S.
[01:27:59.568 --> 01:28:02.410]  is being divided and sliced up right now in front of me.
[01:28:02.631 --> 01:28:06.574]  And watching America be butchered like a Christmas hog makes me angry.
[01:28:07.055 --> 01:28:08.636]  That's why I'm here and focused.
[01:28:08.856 --> 01:28:09.777]  No more games.
[01:28:09.977 --> 01:28:10.738]  No more jokes.
[01:28:10.878 --> 01:28:13.080]  This is my declaration of re-independence.
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:16.083]  To redouble my efforts in this fight against the globalists.
[01:28:18.081 --> 01:28:20.042]  Let's go ahead and talk to Carl in Liberty Hill.
[01:28:20.082 --> 01:28:21.242]  You're on the air, Carl.
[01:28:22.162 --> 01:28:22.862]  Hey, Alex.
[01:28:22.922 --> 01:28:23.503]  God bless you.
[01:28:23.523 --> 01:28:26.903]  Jesus said you will know the truth and the truth will make you free.
[01:28:26.923 --> 01:28:29.964]  You're a frontline battle commander in the information wars.
[01:28:30.124 --> 01:28:35.946]  And by the way, when this whole thing gets locked down, all the people that are sleeping now, they will wake up.
[01:28:36.006 --> 01:28:37.546]  They woke up in Nazi Germany.
[01:28:37.987 --> 01:28:40.387]  They'll wake up either willingly or unwillingly.
[01:28:40.827 --> 01:28:46.869]  And the same people that are giving you heat right now are going to thank God for Alex Jones on that day.
[01:28:47.309 --> 01:28:48.750]  Listen, it's not me, okay?
[01:28:48.970 --> 01:28:53.432]  I'm just a person that was dumb enough to be early and on the front line of this fight because I don't like bullies.
[01:28:53.472 --> 01:28:54.192]  Let me tell you something.
[01:28:54.853 --> 01:28:57.354]  Let me just tell you something about this though.
[01:28:57.414 --> 01:28:58.774]  It was a key point I was going to make and I lost it.
[01:28:58.794 --> 01:28:59.515]  Go ahead and make your point.
[01:28:59.735 --> 01:29:06.818]  Well, I'll just say, since a lot of the broadcasts, including yours, are international nowadays via the internet, you're reaching a lot of people.
[01:29:06.838 --> 01:29:15.482]  You're a major recruiting tool to bring people on board and recruit for the cause and bring people on the team, so never underestimate the power of what you're doing.
[01:29:16.002 --> 01:29:24.888]  And just the only comment was, aren't we being used nowadays, the United States, to project power internationally the same way the British did during the Victorian era?
[01:29:24.928 --> 01:29:25.748]  That's all that happened.
[01:29:25.788 --> 01:29:27.409]  We merged with the British banks.
[01:29:27.469 --> 01:29:29.630]  That's who owns the majority of the Federal Reserve stock.
[01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:30.891]  You hit the nail on the head.
[01:29:30.911 --> 01:29:33.373]  By the way, they write books about it bragging.
[01:29:34.133 --> 01:29:35.454]  When we get back, I'll get into it.
[01:29:35.514 --> 01:29:37.955]  Everybody knows deep down instinctively something's wrong.
[01:29:38.256 --> 01:29:39.596]  People know instinctively listening.
[01:29:39.636 --> 01:29:40.997]  You know I'm telling you the truth, folks.
[01:29:41.217 --> 01:29:42.798]  You know, you feel the darkness.
[01:29:43.479 --> 01:29:44.259]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:45.340]  Stay with me.
[01:29:52.023 --> 01:29:56.328]  If you've ever wanted to grow the absolute best tasting fruits and vegetables imaginable, here's some exciting news.
[01:29:56.528 --> 01:29:59.210]  There's a new product designed to make growing delicious produce easy.
[01:29:59.391 --> 01:30:01.793]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's dynamite in the garden.
[01:30:02.033 --> 01:30:08.780]  Proto-Gro is a bioactive superfood for plants that works by providing true broad spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their full genetic expression.
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:10.161]  What does this mean in the garden?
[01:30:10.241 --> 01:30:21.549]  It needs mouth-watering fruits and vegetables, brilliantly colored flowers, herbs that finally grow to medicinal strength, blue ribbon garden produce jam-packed with bioavailable minerals and trace elements, giant pumpkins, even high-potency high-bricks wheatgrass.
[01:30:21.629 --> 01:30:24.671]  Proto-Gro is a proprietary blend of full-spectrum nutrients from the sea.
[01:30:24.811 --> 01:30:27.413]  It literally contains the basic building blocks of life itself.
[01:30:27.633 --> 01:30:34.638]  In fact, Proto-Gro is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record time that it almost forces plants to grow even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[01:30:34.918 --> 01:30:37.500]  It's also perfect for growing your own survival foods and mice.
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:40.322]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:40.362 --> 01:30:44.445]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:44.465 --> 01:30:45.686]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:45.766 --> 01:30:48.548]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:07.162 --> 01:31:07.622]  I don't know.
[01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:25.510]  I think so.
[01:31:53.797 --> 01:31:54.837]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:31:55.158 --> 01:31:57.959]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:31:58.219 --> 01:32:02.360]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:32:02.801 --> 01:32:03.621]  So what do you do?
[01:32:03.941 --> 01:32:08.503]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:32:09.003 --> 01:32:11.104]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:32:11.604 --> 01:32:26.307]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:32:26.347 --> 01:32:33.409]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:32:33.769 --> 01:32:38.171]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:32:38.611 --> 01:32:42.653]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[01:32:42.933 --> 01:32:46.074]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:32:46.214 --> 01:32:49.915]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:32:53.757 --> 01:32:55.718]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer!
[01:32:56.198 --> 01:32:58.839]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[01:32:59.642 --> 01:33:00.743]  For a while anyway.
[01:33:00.763 --> 01:33:04.446]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[01:33:05.066 --> 01:33:07.388]  Listen, haven't you heard about Cal-X ointment?
[01:33:07.688 --> 01:33:11.191]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:33:11.551 --> 01:33:13.713]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:33:14.352 --> 01:33:15.093]  What's the name again?
[01:33:15.453 --> 01:33:16.454]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:33:16.834 --> 01:33:17.675]  It's Calex.
[01:33:17.955 --> 01:33:19.697]  C-A-L-E-X.
[01:33:20.518 --> 01:33:22.199]  What makes Calex ointment so different?
[01:33:22.399 --> 01:33:30.687]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:36.311]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing CalX ointment.
[01:33:36.511 --> 01:33:45.632]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B Grocery Stores, Medicine Shot Pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:33:46.353 --> 01:33:47.433]  Hey, there's a drug store.
[01:33:47.513 --> 01:33:48.153]  I'll be right back.
[01:33:48.433 --> 01:33:49.433]  I'm getting some CalX.
[01:33:52.134 --> 01:33:55.974]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:33:56.914 --> 01:33:59.215]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:34:01.311 --> 01:34:03.852]  Through the lies and disinformation.
[01:34:06.533 --> 01:34:07.633]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:09.474 --> 01:34:10.734]  Alright, final segment.
[01:34:10.794 --> 01:34:12.915]  Boy, I wish I had more time today.
[01:34:12.935 --> 01:34:14.536]  This is a lot to cover.
[01:34:14.576 --> 01:34:16.556]  We're going to jam in four or five more calls here at the end.
[01:34:16.576 --> 01:34:18.697]  Let me just go through a news blitz here for you.
[01:34:19.817 --> 01:34:26.300]  Okay, every couple days you hear about him raiding an Al Qaeda stronghold and then most of the time I read deeper and it says that it's Shiite.
[01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:30.261]  Shiite's the opposite of Sunni.
[01:34:31.408 --> 01:34:39.031]  And then when it's even a Sunni group, I'll go look up the group and really look up the State Department, the CIA, and what other major think tanks say, and they'll admit it's not Al-Qaeda.
[01:34:39.551 --> 01:34:48.254]  Al-Qaeda is the name of a CIA computer database set up in 79 for managing extreme Wahhabist Arab fighters, extreme Sunnis worldwide.
[01:34:49.234 --> 01:34:50.615]  Okay, and then you read an article, U.S.
[01:34:50.695 --> 01:34:53.356]  military rescues 42 Iraqis from Al-Qaeda prison.
[01:34:54.176 --> 01:34:57.517]  And sure enough, I mean, it is... They're not even clear.
[01:34:57.537 --> 01:34:59.378]  It looks like it's not even a Sunni group.
[01:34:59.418 --> 01:35:00.098]  It looks like it may be...
[01:35:01.202 --> 01:35:04.223]  In with Al Sadr and the Shiite, but they know that doesn't matter.
[01:35:04.243 --> 01:35:05.243]  They just call it Al Qaeda.
[01:35:05.623 --> 01:35:10.304]  I heard an article about them attacking in a whole separate country, a whole other area.
[01:35:10.884 --> 01:35:15.366]  You know, in Lebanon, and they were calling it Al Qaeda fighters, and I know that it's the Iran-backed group.
[01:35:15.646 --> 01:35:18.066]  Iran's mortal enemies with Al Qaeda, folks!
[01:35:19.106 --> 01:35:19.947]  You understand that?
[01:35:20.227 --> 01:35:21.407]  It's two different groups!
[01:35:22.007 --> 01:35:25.388]  This is like if they said the Dallas Cowboys were
[01:35:28.101 --> 01:35:29.502]  Really, the Washington Redskins?
[01:35:29.542 --> 01:35:32.344]  I mean, it's just, it's just, it's unbelievable how they treat you.
[01:35:33.545 --> 01:35:37.609]  I mean, they talk to you like you're completely stupid, but I understand why they do, because you buy it!
[01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:38.910]  I mean, they just laugh at you!
[01:35:38.930 --> 01:35:46.256]  And they go, oh my gosh, there may have been torture, and they might have been secretly holding people for six months, but then we knew that, and it's good, oh!
[01:35:46.576 --> 01:35:49.698]  It's all put out, and they put out some fake al-Qaeda torture manual.
[01:35:49.998 --> 01:35:51.800]  I saw, I looked at it, you could just tell it was fake.
[01:35:52.355 --> 01:35:53.976]  But it's not just me telling it's fake.
[01:35:54.356 --> 01:35:57.318]  They put out fake beheading videos that get traced back to the government before.
[01:35:57.578 --> 01:35:59.199]  And fat Bin Ladens that aren't real.
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:00.720]  Now listen to this.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:02.501]  Bush sanctions black ops against Iran.
[01:36:02.521 --> 01:36:09.786]  London Telegraph President Bush has given the CIA approval to launch covert black operations to achieve regime change in Iran.
[01:36:09.826 --> 01:36:10.946]  Intelligence sources reveal.
[01:36:11.166 --> 01:36:11.907]  And it says the U.S.
[01:36:11.947 --> 01:36:12.707]  government admits it.
[01:36:12.907 --> 01:36:15.269]  Here's French news agency NBBC reporting.
[01:36:15.729 --> 01:36:22.013]  Iran rebels say U.S.-led coalition has granted them protection status inside Iran to launch a military attack.
[01:36:22.702 --> 01:36:41.772]  I've got several articles on this, and it says it is the People's Mujahideen Fighters, which, by the way, ladies and gentlemen, are, quote, Al-Qaeda affiliated, and there's three other groups, excuse me, four other groups, of the five groups, four of them are Sunni, four of them are Wahhabist, four of them are what you'd call Al-Qaeda.
[01:36:41.792 --> 01:36:43.033]  I mean, they're the group!
[01:36:43.653 --> 01:36:45.534]  And they're in the West attacking the Iranians!
[01:36:46.833 --> 01:36:51.223]  To bring the nation down for the globalists who, quote, we call the United States.
[01:36:51.464 --> 01:36:56.815]  Now we're just another hegemon, another doppelganger, another clone, another army they use.
[01:36:58.627 --> 01:37:00.649]  I mean, just go research.
[01:37:00.769 --> 01:37:02.951]  Just go do the keyword searches in mainstream news.
[01:37:03.291 --> 01:37:04.052]  It's all in there.
[01:37:04.452 --> 01:37:09.336]  I mean, even the government's own propaganda has to admit deeper in it that they're using Wahhabis.
[01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:10.737]  They're using real Al-Qaeda.
[01:37:11.097 --> 01:37:13.740]  Saudi Arabia and Iran are big enemies, folks.
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:16.322]  Saudi Arabia is funding Wahhabis to attack.
[01:37:16.622 --> 01:37:17.623]  Our government's training them.
[01:37:18.704 --> 01:37:24.689]  British generals have been on record saying, no, there's really no Iranian weapons coming in when they resign.
[01:37:25.652 --> 01:37:28.933]  Everything that the globalists are accusing Iran of, the globalists are doing to them.
[01:37:29.053 --> 01:37:31.834]  They claim Iran has Al-Qaeda attacking us.
[01:37:32.354 --> 01:37:35.435]  Folks, Al-Qaeda is attacking Iran!
[01:37:35.455 --> 01:37:39.297]  I just cannot... Trey, am I making sense on this?
[01:37:39.577 --> 01:37:41.737]  Sometimes the most simple thing, it's hard to explain.
[01:37:42.157 --> 01:37:44.198]  I mean, the lie is so amazing.
[01:37:44.838 --> 01:37:45.098]  Trey?
[01:37:46.799 --> 01:37:49.080]  It makes sense, but it's just such a complicated thing.
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:49.700]  It just takes...
[01:37:50.319 --> 01:37:56.483]  I mean, in order for anyone to understand it, they're just going to have to get out there and read the articles like anyone needs to do it.
[01:37:56.503 --> 01:37:57.323]  I mean, it's real simple.
[01:37:57.383 --> 01:37:59.264]  The groups attacking Iran under U.S.
[01:37:59.304 --> 01:38:03.426]  backing in the West, over the eastern border of Iraq, are Al-Qaeda groups.
[01:38:04.047 --> 01:38:05.428]  Which were started by the U.S.
[01:38:06.048 --> 01:38:07.669]  And being funded right now by them.
[01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:07.969]  Correct.
[01:38:09.053 --> 01:38:13.176]  I mean, to say started, it's kind of like, you know, they went out and recruited these groups.
[01:38:13.196 --> 01:38:14.777]  Well, yeah, I didn't mean started, but... No, no, you're right.
[01:38:14.837 --> 01:38:15.457]  I was saying started.
[01:38:15.958 --> 01:38:18.999]  It's more like they were encouraged and... They nurtured them, exactly.
[01:38:19.019 --> 01:38:19.380]  Exactly.
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:22.121]  I mean, they grew a mighty oak grows from an acorn.
[01:38:22.161 --> 01:38:23.102]  It was acorn-sized.
[01:38:23.122 --> 01:38:24.763]  Now it's the world record-sized oak.
[01:38:25.023 --> 01:38:29.966]  And it's clearly open that most of these groups were used by the U.S.
[01:38:30.006 --> 01:38:35.609]  government to take out communist groups in Russia and all through, you know, Uzbekistan and all that.
[01:38:35.690 --> 01:38:36.090]  Everywhere.
[01:38:36.190 --> 01:38:36.570]  Everywhere.
[01:38:37.591 --> 01:38:38.011]  Exactly.
[01:38:38.894 --> 01:38:39.975]  That's all there is to it.
[01:38:40.015 --> 01:38:40.775]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:38:42.036 --> 01:38:45.518]  That fact right there should be enough to make the people just question.
[01:38:46.178 --> 01:38:50.200]  You know, Conrad, Joseph Conrad, wrote Rob Roy and much other famous books.
[01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:51.801]  And he was a famous British captain.
[01:38:51.821 --> 01:38:52.581]  He was really Polish.
[01:38:53.522 --> 01:38:56.523]  But his parents died and he moved to England and became pretty famous.
[01:38:56.563 --> 01:39:01.086]  But he wrote books in fiction that were really about real things that happened with the names changing.
[01:39:01.146 --> 01:39:02.606]  I haven't read it yet, but I read the synopsis.
[01:39:02.887 --> 01:39:05.928]  My dad said he read The Secret Agent, written like 150 years ago.
[01:39:06.248 --> 01:39:07.349]  It's called The Secret Agent.
[01:39:08.219 --> 01:39:09.684]  By Joseph Conrad.
[01:39:09.724 --> 01:39:10.246]  People ought to read it.
[01:39:10.266 --> 01:39:10.707]  I'm going to read it.
[01:39:11.028 --> 01:39:14.881]  But it's all about the British... Well, the French staged terror attacks.
[01:39:16.688 --> 01:39:21.852]  In England, to then have the British government over-respond to destabilize England.
[01:39:22.152 --> 01:39:24.495]  And it's, of course, like everything else, based on real stuff.
[01:39:24.795 --> 01:39:28.258]  My dad's like, my God, people knew all this back then!
[01:39:28.418 --> 01:39:33.623]  And by the way, my dad was like, I didn't know there were communists 150 years ago, before they announced it with Marx and Engels.
[01:39:33.883 --> 01:39:36.485]  And he didn't know they were having international roundtable meetings.
[01:39:36.725 --> 01:39:39.468]  That was in this book, written by Joseph Conrad.
[01:39:40.209 --> 01:39:52.926]  And again, after lunch today I ran in and pulled up the synopsis of The Secret Agent by Joseph Conrad, and sure enough it said all that, but I mean... Oh my God, folks, we're in so much trouble.
[01:39:53.186 --> 01:39:54.508]  This is called Black Ops, okay?
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:08.285]  The Black Ops article even clearly states that one of the purposes for the Black Ops is actually to destabilize Iran, and why do we need to go around destabilizing other governments?
[01:40:08.305 --> 01:40:15.968]  Oh, it says that they're trying to overthrow the country economically and militarily, they're launching military... I mean, our government has publicly announced they're attacking Iran right now!
[01:40:16.088 --> 01:40:21.950]  It's all over, I mean... They've been doing it for three years, and Iran sits there and takes it because they know it's a war provocation!
[01:40:23.630 --> 01:40:27.492]  And the media's like, if we drop nukes on them, they might fight back.
[01:40:27.512 --> 01:40:29.252]  And the media's like, how dare them!
[01:40:29.272 --> 01:40:36.295]  I mean, imagine, if you fight back when we drop tactical nukes on you, we will hit your major cities with nukes.
[01:40:36.975 --> 01:40:40.516]  And you got people who can't even find it on a map driving around going, parking lot!
[01:40:40.817 --> 01:40:42.577]  Nukem grass parking lot!
[01:40:42.857 --> 01:40:44.598]  Can't even find these people on a map!
[01:40:45.539 --> 01:40:46.440]  Oh my God, folks.
[01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:58.913]  Hey, you think a government that'll drop nukes on a country cares about you, you idiot, driving around in your truck right now with your W sticker on or your Hillary... Listen to this.
[01:40:58.953 --> 01:41:02.176]  Judicial Watch uncovers three deaths relating to HPV vaccine.
[01:41:02.196 --> 01:41:03.657]  They've only been given it for nine months.
[01:41:03.677 --> 01:41:04.678]  1,637 adverse reactions.
[01:41:08.524 --> 01:41:09.905]  And only a fraction are reported.
[01:41:10.105 --> 01:41:10.925]  Three deaths.
[01:41:11.005 --> 01:41:12.025]  Judicial Watch found that.
[01:41:12.045 --> 01:41:13.246]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:41:13.606 --> 01:41:15.847]  Government knew of HIV risk from imported blood.
[01:41:16.487 --> 01:41:18.548]  It caused over 200,000 deaths worldwide.
[01:41:19.008 --> 01:41:20.448]  Close to 2,000 in England.
[01:41:20.528 --> 01:41:24.029]  And they knew it had HIV and hepatitis in it and didn't care.
[01:41:24.450 --> 01:41:26.210]  Because there was a eugenics decision made.
[01:41:26.250 --> 01:41:27.231]  This is London Guardian.
[01:41:27.631 --> 01:41:32.352]  A eugenicist decision made that the hemophiliacs didn't deserve to be taken care of.
[01:41:32.372 --> 01:41:35.694]  I would think your government wouldn't kill you on 9-11 though, would they?
[01:41:35.934 --> 01:41:36.854]  It's not your government.
[01:41:37.418 --> 01:41:38.799]  Common household chemicals.
[01:41:38.819 --> 01:41:39.839]  That's why all these cancers are up.
[01:41:39.879 --> 01:41:44.962]  One of the cocktail of reasons is that when a tiny fetus gets hit with these, it's causing massive problems.
[01:41:45.102 --> 01:41:45.262]  L.A.
[01:41:45.302 --> 01:41:45.602]  Times.
[01:41:45.902 --> 01:41:46.763]  Big report on that.
[01:41:46.823 --> 01:41:47.904]  You want to do something environmental?
[01:41:47.924 --> 01:41:48.944]  Let's control these toxins.
[01:41:49.324 --> 01:41:52.026]  Not have a global tax on carbon dioxide emissions.
[01:41:52.286 --> 01:41:53.006]  What a scam.
[01:41:54.127 --> 01:41:56.928]  Medical experiments to be done without patient's consent.
[01:41:57.028 --> 01:41:58.929]  Big Washington Post article.
[01:41:58.949 --> 01:42:03.492]  Says five-year project aims to improve car crash, cardiac, and other treatments.
[01:42:03.512 --> 01:42:04.192]  But here's the problem.
[01:42:04.798 --> 01:42:06.119]  Why did they ever do this in the past?
[01:42:06.219 --> 01:42:07.519]  Why before didn't we do this?
[01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:13.923]  They're already taking corneas and livers and killing people in a lot of these hospitals if they don't think they can save you so they can sell your goods.
[01:42:14.543 --> 01:42:16.704]  We're talking 200 plus grand per person they murder.
[01:42:17.544 --> 01:42:24.428]  And so now they want to, oh it's a federal government's decided we're going to do medical experiments for your own good without your consent.
[01:42:25.468 --> 01:42:26.489]  But see it won't stop there.
[01:42:26.729 --> 01:42:29.330]  And see they have all these reasons for it, but why wasn't it done in the past?
[01:42:30.351 --> 01:42:30.591]  You see?
[01:42:32.052 --> 01:42:36.599]  Or, why didn't they say, oh, sign a card or have a bracelet on saying we can experiment on you?
[01:42:37.199 --> 01:42:37.340]  Uh-uh.
[01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:41.405]  They just say, oh, things change by the way, we experiment on you now if we want.
[01:42:41.866 --> 01:42:42.647]  You ought to look at U.S.
[01:42:42.687 --> 01:42:44.509]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Paragraph B.
[01:42:47.413 --> 01:42:47.873]  That's U.S.
[01:42:47.913 --> 01:42:54.535]  Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A, Paragraph B. You know why I memorized U.S.
[01:42:54.575 --> 01:42:55.155]  Code Chapter 50?
[01:42:55.795 --> 01:42:56.235]  No, U.S.
[01:42:56.275 --> 01:43:03.516]  Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A, Paragraph B, authorizes the killing of American citizens with chemical, biological, and radiological weapons for any research purpose.
[01:43:03.536 --> 01:43:04.397]  So they're just announcing to you
[01:43:16.537 --> 01:43:18.639]  An executive order put into U.S.
[01:43:18.719 --> 01:43:20.900]  Code over a decade ago.
[01:43:21.701 --> 01:43:22.362]  Oh, you don't believe me?
[01:43:22.562 --> 01:43:24.603]  It's in Cornell Laws, the first link that comes up.
[01:43:25.164 --> 01:43:25.384]  U.S.
[01:43:25.424 --> 01:43:32.850]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Paragraph B. So this is just a little announcement for you.
[01:43:33.150 --> 01:43:34.131]  You go, oh, it's good?
[01:43:34.391 --> 01:43:34.771]  Oh, really?
[01:43:34.791 --> 01:43:35.772]  Why did they do it before?
[01:43:36.052 --> 01:43:37.133]  We used to be normal.
[01:43:37.253 --> 01:43:38.254]  We used to have freedom.
[01:43:38.454 --> 01:43:42.417]  We used to have a little boss hog corruption, but overall, this was a place that had due process.
[01:43:43.212 --> 01:43:46.075]  And a sharecropper had as much rights as David Rockefeller.
[01:43:46.416 --> 01:43:48.518]  Well, it ain't that way anymore, America!
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:51.461]  Okay, I have that for you.
[01:43:51.862 --> 01:43:53.223]  That's all from PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:43:54.985 --> 01:43:56.026]  No new refineries in the U.S.
[01:43:56.046 --> 01:43:56.907]  for 29 years.
[01:43:57.107 --> 01:44:00.151]  It is not because of the environmental front people they use, they blame it on.
[01:44:00.431 --> 01:44:02.954]  We have the corporate documents where they bought them all up and shut them down.
[01:44:04.306 --> 01:44:05.506]  All right, I don't have time to go to your calls.
[01:44:05.546 --> 01:44:05.987]  I'm out of time.
[01:44:06.047 --> 01:44:07.207]  I apologize to everybody else.
[01:44:07.247 --> 01:44:07.787]  Call me back.
[01:44:07.907 --> 01:44:08.727]  Chris in Toronto.
[01:44:08.967 --> 01:44:09.668]  Will in Philadelphia.
[01:44:09.688 --> 01:44:10.208]  Everybody else.
[01:44:10.268 --> 01:44:11.948]  Mark in Southwest Austin.
[01:44:12.649 --> 01:44:13.269]  Everybody else.
[01:44:13.309 --> 01:44:13.929]  God bless you!
[01:44:14.469 --> 01:44:15.369]  We tried our best.
[01:44:15.930 --> 01:44:16.950]  I've given you the facts.
[01:44:18.851 --> 01:44:20.171]  I've tried to warn you.
[01:44:21.331 --> 01:44:22.852]  Bush is now an official dictator.
[01:44:22.872 --> 01:44:24.312]  Don't worry, Hillary will get those powers.
[01:44:25.113 --> 01:44:25.913]  Don't worry, liberals.
[01:44:25.933 --> 01:44:26.953]  You'll get what you want soon enough.
[01:44:26.973 --> 01:44:28.734]  The death of America, along with the fake conservatives.
[01:44:29.174 --> 01:44:32.835]  You can all merge together and be a bunch of chicken-belly worshippers of tyranny.
[01:44:33.844 --> 01:44:35.486]  Alright, PrisonPlanet.com is the website.
[01:44:35.566 --> 01:44:38.249]  Google TerrorStorm, my newest film, and watch it today.
[01:44:38.289 --> 01:44:38.629]  God bless.
[01:44:42.100 --> 01:44:43.021]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[01:44:43.061 --> 01:44:50.204]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[01:44:50.465 --> 01:44:53.366]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[01:44:53.546 --> 01:44:59.209]  If you have a business product or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.

[01:45:13.308 --> 01:45:15.809]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:45:16.269 --> 01:45:18.170]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:45:18.871 --> 01:45:22.052]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:45:22.712 --> 01:45:29.175]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
