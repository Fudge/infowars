[00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.030]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:07.751]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.452 --> 00:00:09.572]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.213 --> 00:00:11.033]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.794 --> 00:00:12.674]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.694 --> 00:00:17.197]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.537 --> 00:00:21.619]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.106 --> 00:00:36.627]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:36.747 --> 00:00:37.247]  Welcome.
[00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:38.127]  We're live.
[00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:43.750]  It is the seventh day already.
[00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.311]  The seventh day of September 2007.
[00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:52.673]  Aaron Russo's memorial is going to be happening today.
[00:00:54.614 --> 00:00:55.995]  Out in California.
[00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:57.875]  So happy trails, my friend.
[00:00:58.636 --> 00:01:01.097]  I'll be in New York tomorrow morning.
[00:01:01.337 --> 00:01:02.257]  Tomorrow afternoon.
[00:01:02.317 --> 00:01:03.358]  I'll be there through Tuesday.
[00:01:03.398 --> 00:01:04.018]  Fly back in.
[00:01:04.807 --> 00:01:08.109]  Wednesday morning, Bob Dacey will be sitting in Monday and Tuesday.
[00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:26.120]  I'll be doing live reports as well as other people there on the scene with live reports throughout the two days that Bob Dacey, local television host, good friend of mine, and writer for the New American Magazine, will be sitting in here coming up on Monday and Tuesday.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.882]  Richard Reeves is coming up in about an hour and a half.
[00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:32.544]  He's a local activist and talk show host in his own right.
[00:01:32.944 --> 00:01:34.225]  He went to the Strophold
[00:01:35.143 --> 00:01:42.727]  With Ron Paul, and he's got eyewitness reports of a military-style PSYOP that was run on the delegates.
[00:01:43.688 --> 00:01:45.749]  And this has been confirmed by others that were there.
[00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.451]  This is extremely, extremely newsworthy.
[00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:50.031]  I know some people were videotaping this.
[00:01:50.051 --> 00:01:52.573]  We need to get a videotape of it to show people.
[00:01:53.528 --> 00:02:01.432]  But saying that Al-Qaeda was going to attack, and 9-11 isn't an inside job, and there's nukes all over America, and big screens.
[00:02:01.712 --> 00:02:03.333]  Nothing to do with the delegate meeting.
[00:02:03.853 --> 00:02:05.234]  This is happening all over the country.
[00:02:07.015 --> 00:02:11.057]  Luke Radowsky, of course, is going to be joining us as well to pop in.
[00:02:11.217 --> 00:02:18.960]  Last interview before what kicks off this weekend for the sixth anniversary of the 9-11 attacks.
[00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:22.302]  Sherry Hall
[00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:25.339]  She's going to be joining us for about 15 minutes.
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:51.726]  She's a local Austinite who came to see Endgame Tuesday night when I showed it and I brought up the point that tetanus shots for women in UN programs all over the world had hormones added to them bound to the tetanus to then sterilize the women and it caused autoimmune responses and killed quite a few but 100% of the time sterilized the women.
[00:02:53.613 --> 00:03:01.898]  And she started talking about that, and there was another lady who popped up and said it happened to her, and another lady, and they were there separately and didn't even know about this.
[00:03:02.638 --> 00:03:03.939]  People were pretty freaked out about it.
[00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:05.420]  Yeah, this is real!
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:17.287]  And then I had Rick, one of Rick Perry's, I'll just leave it at that, high-level staff members, I've seen the guy on television, I knew it was one of Rick Perry's people when I saw him, and he said, yeah, I've been a listener the last few years, and
[00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.020]  He even showed me his gubernatorial boots, because I know the governor's giving people those very boots.
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.861]  Gotta come and take it.
[00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:24.861]  Flag on them.
[00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:46.669]  And he went into how, when he was a medic, when I told the story yesterday, they sent six people down to Fort Sam Houston, the medical facility, quote, to give them their tetanus shot from Fort Sill, not their tetanus, their meningitis, and all six died, and then they told them to pull everything out in the bunk area and scrub them.
[00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:52.850]  In the entire facility they were in, and then they later got word it was some type of bio-weapons test.
[00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.471]  I mean, they just killed them!
[00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:59.792]  Kids say, here are these troops, give them these shots, bye-bye!
[00:04:00.652 --> 00:04:02.692]  And they die pretty grisly deaths, too.
[00:04:05.353 --> 00:04:09.454]  We have eugenicists running things who openly say they want to kill us.
[00:04:10.394 --> 00:04:10.734]  Okay?
[00:04:11.234 --> 00:04:14.055]  Then it becomes very easy to understand why they carried out 9-11.
[00:04:15.925 --> 00:04:20.266]  This is very simple, and if we don't grow up, it's going to get worse and worse.
[00:04:20.366 --> 00:04:22.387]  Then the question is, well, why aren't you dead?
[00:04:23.227 --> 00:04:24.828]  Well, number one, the good Lord above.
[00:04:27.109 --> 00:04:29.509]  Not before, I mean, even before I started fighting the New World Order.
[00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.591]  I don't think I would be here if it wasn't for God's intervention.
[00:04:34.311 --> 00:04:37.752]  But secondarily, they don't want to make me a martyr, at least not yet.
[00:04:39.597 --> 00:04:43.479]  And they know if they kill me, it's only going to spread my information farther.
[00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.640]  And they know my information is accurate and dangerous.
[00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:49.042]  And they don't want to validate it that way.
[00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:53.464]  You see, the blood of patriots waters the tree of liberty.
[00:04:54.084 --> 00:04:54.784]  And they know that.
[00:04:55.465 --> 00:04:56.125]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:02.822 --> 00:05:03.862]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:05:04.202 --> 00:05:06.983]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:05:07.243 --> 00:05:11.405]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:05:11.825 --> 00:05:12.665]  So what do you do?
[00:05:12.965 --> 00:05:17.527]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:05:18.027 --> 00:05:20.168]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:05:20.648 --> 00:05:35.352]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:05:35.392 --> 00:05:42.434]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:05:42.794 --> 00:05:47.197]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:05:47.637 --> 00:05:49.418]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:05:49.438 --> 00:05:49.658]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:05:49.738 --> 00:05:51.219]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:06:03.937 --> 00:06:09.423]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:09.784 --> 00:06:17.412]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.109 --> 00:06:25.173]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.553 --> 00:06:36.979]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:40.841]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.242 --> 00:06:43.203]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.523 --> 00:06:47.365]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:01.798 --> 00:07:02.998]  Want to know my little secret?
[00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:10.081]  I have rich, delicious chocolate as much as I want, every single day, and I never feel bad about it.
[00:07:10.561 --> 00:07:15.383]  Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea gives you real, natural cocoa, without any fat or sugar.
[00:07:16.143 --> 00:07:23.085]  Even better, Cocoa Pure is made with nutrients that keep my heart healthy, my energy levels up, and my body looking great.
[00:07:23.665 --> 00:07:28.727]  I'm having smooth, tasty chocolate every single day, and it's helping me stay healthier than ever.
[00:07:29.447 --> 00:07:33.610]  You can give yourself the gift of health by calling for a bottle of Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea.
[00:07:34.151 --> 00:07:36.852]  The only thing better than chocolate is healthy chocolate.
[00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:40.935]  Here's how you can get a bottle of delicious Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea.
[00:07:41.796 --> 00:07:45.398]  For your wrist-free bottle of Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea, call 1-800-894-3596.
[00:07:45.418 --> 00:07:52.483]  And if you call now, you can find out how to get a free bottle of Cocoa Pure with your order.
[00:07:52.624 --> 00:07:52.884]  Call 1-800-894-3596.
[00:07:52.904 --> 00:07:53.164]  That's 1-800-894-3596.
[00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:08.249]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.910]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.411 --> 00:08:18.912]  Top stories today.
[00:08:21.332 --> 00:08:27.194]  John Edwards is calling for a global anti-terror force, a global police force.
[00:08:27.234 --> 00:08:28.534]  Of course, that's been in the UN
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.842]  Plans for 50 plus years, now they're announcing it again.
[00:08:32.882 --> 00:08:35.544]  World government in the name of fighting terror.
[00:08:35.624 --> 00:08:38.425]  North American Union in the name of fighting terror.
[00:08:38.505 --> 00:08:45.609]  Militarized police banning free speech, banning demonstrations, banning America in the name of saving America.
[00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.912]  We'll get into that, and it's becoming so ridiculous.
[00:08:50.472 --> 00:08:56.095]  I get addicted to message boards and postings, not even message boards, but reading people's comments.
[00:08:57.116 --> 00:08:58.177]  And I probably spent 20 minutes
[00:08:59.847 --> 00:09:05.031]  I did have, earlier this morning, reading the ABC News story as they show the new Bin Laden.
[00:09:05.651 --> 00:09:08.973]  They announce it's him, he's alive, he's gonna kill us.
[00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:12.836]  He's released this video for September 11th.
[00:09:14.677 --> 00:09:18.560]  And it looks like one of those animated video games where they have the animated people.
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.462]  It doesn't even look like a good Bin Laden, a good fake.
[00:09:23.023 --> 00:09:25.104]  He looks like it's Bin Laden from 1985.
[00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:30.710]  In 2000, he had sunken in eyes and a gray beard.
[00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.432]  Now he's plump and got a big black beard.
[00:09:34.452 --> 00:09:38.455]  He's gained weight, but it's the very same Photoshop background.
[00:09:38.515 --> 00:09:41.738]  I mean, you can tell it's been altered.
[00:09:41.778 --> 00:09:45.060]  Now, Intel Center's been caught altering video.
[00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:46.522]  Wire Magazine broke that.
[00:09:48.483 --> 00:09:51.425]  They're run by several former top CIA officials.
[00:09:51.525 --> 00:09:52.246]  That's admitted.
[00:09:53.863 --> 00:09:58.328]  We've caught other Bin Laden tapes being uploaded by other government-controlled groups.
[00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.412]  It's just totally fake.
[00:10:01.452 --> 00:10:06.117]  But the good news is, there are hundreds and hundreds of posts on ABC's site.
[00:10:07.552 --> 00:10:21.038]  And I have to say, for every 30 or 40 saying it's totally fake, this is a joke, come on, it's photoshopped, he's been dead for years of kidney failure, on and on and on, look at how they're bringing him out at this convenient time.
[00:10:21.379 --> 00:10:29.162]  I mean, literally, I'd read 30 or 40 posts, and this is ABC News readers, and they're all saying it's fake.
[00:10:30.703 --> 00:10:34.945]  Literally, I had to read for like 15 minutes to find one.
[00:10:37.685 --> 00:10:39.826]  And then I can't tell if that one's a joke or not.
[00:10:39.866 --> 00:10:40.827]  It sounds like a joke.
[00:10:41.927 --> 00:10:43.548]  You can go up to Drudge Report right now.
[00:10:43.588 --> 00:10:43.848]  I don't know.
[00:10:43.908 --> 00:10:47.450]  I think we put a link to it on PrisonPlanet.com and they've got a link to Bin Laden's back.
[00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.811]  And you go to it and say, I've got it here in front of me.
[00:10:51.232 --> 00:10:51.972]  And just go read.
[00:10:52.012 --> 00:10:52.992]  I mean, there's the proof.
[00:10:53.113 --> 00:10:56.634]  Your bull isn't shelling anymore.
[00:10:58.775 --> 00:11:00.136]  It doesn't work anymore.
[00:11:01.653 --> 00:11:04.754]  And this new Bin Laden, it's like they're trying to get caught.
[00:11:04.814 --> 00:11:07.236]  Because I know they can make better fake videos than this.
[00:11:07.296 --> 00:11:09.477]  I mean, this is a computer generation.
[00:11:09.497 --> 00:11:15.639]  I don't even need to study the layers or put it into a computer program and break it down, which, by the way, we're doing.
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.201]  I can look at that and I can tell you that is a bad fake.
[00:11:25.864 --> 00:11:28.145]  There is just literally no end to these people.
[00:11:30.174 --> 00:11:40.476]  But then I realized that they're targeting the mass of people that don't know how to get on a computer or don't know how to message or post on an ABC News story.
[00:11:40.516 --> 00:11:44.998]  See, that's already a limited select group that even surf the web and read news.
[00:11:45.638 --> 00:11:55.000]  The people that'll buy this, hearing Bin Laden's back, but they had a national poll a few months ago where, what was it, 68% of 40 and above, for some reason, 68% of 40 years old and older,
[00:12:01.045 --> 00:12:04.447]  Don't know what year 9-11 happened.
[00:12:04.907 --> 00:12:08.188]  And one-fifth of high school seniors don't know where the U.S.
[00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:09.509]  is on a globe.
[00:12:09.609 --> 00:12:12.090]  I mean, this is really happening.
[00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.431]  So see, they're targeting them.
[00:12:16.592 --> 00:12:21.694]  Like the Republican memo that's now been leaked out and now been confirmed to be accurate in New York Magazine, New Yorker Magazine.
[00:12:22.461 --> 00:12:23.582]  And then you can see the results.
[00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:25.424]  It broke last week and see the results now.
[00:12:25.484 --> 00:12:27.645]  The Pell-Mell push for war with Iran.
[00:12:28.006 --> 00:12:31.409]  And they said, look, we don't have most of the public, but all we need is 35%.
[00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:34.491]  And that's all they need.
[00:12:34.812 --> 00:12:38.895]  They need the 35% that are the cops and the military and the bureaucrats.
[00:12:39.015 --> 00:12:39.596]  And that's it.
[00:12:40.076 --> 00:12:42.278]  And that's why they hire people now with below 100 IQs.
[00:12:43.962 --> 00:12:49.527]  That's why they get them into gang mentality, cult-like cultures where everyone enforces the fraud.
[00:12:49.947 --> 00:12:55.112]  But I'm telling you folks, when they're putting out fake cartoons, I've been lying now.
[00:12:55.172 --> 00:13:03.099]  Now don't forget that a year and a half ago, Steve Watson pointed out something that was hidden in plain view and ended up being one of the biggest stories we ever put out.
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:09.105]  I mean, tens and tens and tens of millions read it alone on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.net.
[00:13:11.474 --> 00:13:16.277]  Just on our sites, not to mention where it got posted everywhere else, and people checked it out and found that it was crude.
[00:13:17.998 --> 00:13:31.686]  Remember they showed on television, Mohammed Adda, one of the lead hijackers and one of the other supposed hijackers, taking credit and doing their little confessional before they left Afghanistan to go back and carry out 9-11.
[00:13:34.835 --> 00:13:54.322]  And then it got pointed out, and then we simply put it all together and posted it, but it got pointed out by TV stations in Europe that, wait a minute, that's from a 2002 computer-generated television show that aired on Channel 4 and in the United States.
[00:13:54.362 --> 00:13:57.523]  Channel 4 is a big national network in England, for those that don't know.
[00:13:58.403 --> 00:13:58.923]  And it was!
[00:13:59.023 --> 00:14:03.725]  It was literally a TV show, computer generation, admitted
[00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:05.658]  Understand me.
[00:14:06.198 --> 00:14:07.780]  Admitted fake!
[00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:09.442]  And the U.S.
[00:14:09.482 --> 00:14:14.927]  government took it and put it on the news and said, there's Muhammad Atta admitting he's going to carry out the attacks.
[00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:20.934]  Because they know you've got a public that literally doesn't know anything.
[00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:24.658]  I talk to adults now, I go, do you know what the atmosphere is?
[00:14:25.498 --> 00:14:27.621]  And one of them said, is that the thing in space?
[00:14:30.653 --> 00:14:32.894]  I mean, I don't think people were this dumb five years ago.
[00:14:33.314 --> 00:14:34.815]  They just don't know anything!
[00:14:35.095 --> 00:14:37.876]  So they can put out fake stuff that's admittedly fake!
[00:14:39.797 --> 00:14:45.660]  I mean, that will make you go completely insane just to watch this happen.
[00:14:49.161 --> 00:14:53.383]  They post fake, made-for-TV videos.
[00:14:55.344 --> 00:14:58.986]  And then they re-release them two and a half years later
[00:15:00.504 --> 00:15:01.665]  And say they're real.
[00:15:03.886 --> 00:15:11.031]  And then we point out it's fake, and then it's admittedly fake, and it's big on the internet, but on national news they never retract the story.
[00:15:11.312 --> 00:15:12.493]  They never say it's fake.
[00:15:13.653 --> 00:15:24.621]  Then you've got the other fake Bin Laden video, where he suddenly gained a hundred pounds, his facial features changed, his nose got literally half an inch wider and longer.
[00:15:26.482 --> 00:15:30.005]  They did face scans, it wasn't the same person, French, British,
[00:15:31.371 --> 00:15:32.491]  Canadian and U.S.
[00:15:33.812 --> 00:15:37.473]  universities did scans, said it doesn't pass a face key.
[00:15:37.954 --> 00:15:40.835]  You can scan the real bin Laden's face and try to make a face key off the new one.
[00:15:40.855 --> 00:15:41.255]  It didn't work.
[00:15:41.515 --> 00:15:43.436]  Then they did voice print.
[00:15:43.456 --> 00:15:44.076]  100% accuracy.
[00:15:44.676 --> 00:15:45.997]  Wasn't the same voice.
[00:15:46.337 --> 00:15:50.299]  Then they had linguists listen on top of it and they said, yeah, that's not even bin Laden.
[00:15:50.319 --> 00:15:51.479]  That's a different dialect.
[00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:53.200]  Someone raised in the West.
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:55.961]  Not a Saudi Arabian.
[00:15:57.321 --> 00:15:58.342]  The video was fake.
[00:15:59.402 --> 00:16:01.043]  It doesn't pass voice key.
[00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:03.256]  Voice print, identification.
[00:16:03.957 --> 00:16:08.581]  Understand they take a real Bin Laden, make a voice key with it, run this other Bin Laden through it, doesn't work.
[00:16:08.861 --> 00:16:10.122]  It isn't the same person!
[00:16:10.342 --> 00:16:11.283]  It's a fake!
[00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:14.426]  It's a fake, but that one isn't a computer fake!
[00:16:14.706 --> 00:16:16.768]  It's a fat guy in a dark room!
[00:16:21.532 --> 00:16:25.595]  But again, they don't care about us that are awake and know they're liars now.
[00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:28.338]  They're building FEMA camps, militarizing police for us.
[00:16:29.344 --> 00:16:39.794]  They're just trying to sell 35% of the public to go along with it, because they literally need them to man the McDonald's, and man the FEMA camps, and man the prisons, and put on police uniforms.
[00:16:40.054 --> 00:16:44.838]  And I'm sure you've seen the billboards all over the country, TV, radio ads, join the police force.
[00:16:45.239 --> 00:16:51.645]  They've gone from 300,000 cops 15 years ago, to over a million two, and they say they want to double that in the next year.
[00:16:51.745 --> 00:16:54.908]  I mean, we're knee-deep in it, folks, and it's going to get worse.
[00:16:57.503 --> 00:17:08.025]  And it's going to be about 35% of the public that literally will buy anything literally ruling over us with weapons.
[00:17:09.745 --> 00:17:11.425]  That's what tyranny is, boys and girls.
[00:17:12.846 --> 00:17:17.387]  And they can put fake videos out all day, and these people, they don't know where the U.S.
[00:17:17.507 --> 00:17:21.467]  is, they don't know where Iraq is, they don't know anything.
[00:17:21.507 --> 00:17:25.568]  They just know they got badges, they got guns, and
[00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:27.771]  Martial law's good.
[00:17:31.394 --> 00:17:34.877]  And for the cops that are smart and good Americans, they're all getting off the force.
[00:17:34.897 --> 00:17:36.178]  They've been getting off for 10 years.
[00:17:37.399 --> 00:17:40.741]  Good people in the military don't like serving with nothing but foreigners.
[00:17:41.922 --> 00:17:47.346]  By the way, in Endgame, I say over 100,000, because that was the number I had from like two years ago, the latest I could find.
[00:17:47.647 --> 00:17:49.248]  Now the numbers just came out last week.
[00:17:49.328 --> 00:17:51.530]  It's 400,000 of our troops are foreigners now.
[00:17:54.836 --> 00:18:01.941]  In two years it's gone from 150,000 to 400,000 and that's last year's number!
[00:18:02.301 --> 00:18:03.542]  We always get it a year late.
[00:18:06.063 --> 00:18:10.066]  I saw that in AP last week and I went and pulled it up and actually found the Pentagon source.
[00:18:10.486 --> 00:18:12.407]  I mean, heaven help us!
[00:18:15.129 --> 00:18:18.591]  And they're putting out fake bin Laden videos.
[00:18:19.443 --> 00:18:25.386]  They're putting out videos that are admittedly computer-generated, but then recycling them for the proletariat.
[00:18:28.188 --> 00:18:28.969]  It's off the chart!
[00:18:29.629 --> 00:18:33.091]  I mean, I keep saying off the chart because this stuff has gotten so insane!
[00:18:33.851 --> 00:18:37.033]  And then it turns out the Pentagon admits they're releasing fake stuff!
[00:18:37.433 --> 00:18:43.397]  Paul Watson's got an incredible article up on PrisonPlanet.com and it's up on Infowars.com right now as well.
[00:18:44.671 --> 00:18:48.832]  Neocons enlist Bin Laden's help to counter 9-11 truth.
[00:18:48.932 --> 00:18:50.213]  And that's exactly what it is.
[00:18:50.833 --> 00:18:52.454]  Right on cue, he pops up.
[00:18:53.274 --> 00:18:58.656]  Discredited Pentagon-affiliated intel center to release another dubious tape right when Bush needs it most.
[00:18:59.276 --> 00:19:05.258]  Osama pops up hours after new Zogby poll shows Americans want new 9-11 investigation for second time running.
[00:19:05.771 --> 00:19:06.051]  The U.S.
[00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:21.996]  government via its closely affiliated intel center front is to release a new tape of Osama Bin Laden on the sixth anniversary of 9-11 in a desperate ploy to counter 9-11 truth as a new Zogby poll that again proves the majority of Americans are highly suspect of the official story.
[00:19:24.236 --> 00:19:29.858]  And then he gets later into the key information that the Pentagon admits they release fake reports.
[00:19:30.498 --> 00:19:34.339]  A pre-released image shows an apparently older looking Bin Laden with a
[00:19:35.726 --> 00:19:50.449]  Dyed dark brown beard, meaning the individual with tape is either a body double or the Tarab Master has been using Grecian Formula 16 in between his dashing from cave to cave across the mountainous Pakistani border region.
[00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:54.330]  When we get back, I'll get into the real meat and potatoes on this.
[00:19:56.091 --> 00:19:57.371]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:20:02.808 --> 00:20:07.312]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:07.652 --> 00:20:11.736]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:12.036 --> 00:20:12.577]  We listened.
[00:20:12.897 --> 00:20:17.881]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:18.142 --> 00:20:18.642]  We listened.
[00:20:19.022 --> 00:20:22.065]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:22.485 --> 00:20:23.006]  We listened.
[00:20:23.466 --> 00:20:27.528]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:20:27.908 --> 00:20:28.388]  We listened.
[00:20:28.748 --> 00:20:33.991]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:20:34.391 --> 00:20:35.752]  Again, we listened.
[00:20:36.112 --> 00:20:37.692]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:20:37.872 --> 00:20:43.435]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:20:43.895 --> 00:20:46.537]  Get the Berkey Light at the American Water Purifier.
[00:20:46.737 --> 00:20:46.938]  Only $279.
[00:20:46.998 --> 00:20:47.578]  Call New Millennium 888-03-4438.
[00:20:47.618 --> 00:20:47.858]  That's 888-03-4438.
[00:20:47.918 --> 00:20:49.540]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.540]  Now yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:00.376 --> 00:21:04.041]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:04.442 --> 00:21:09.870]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:10.331 --> 00:21:11.412]  It makes me wonder if a U.S.
[00:21:11.453 --> 00:21:15.499]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:16.139 --> 00:21:29.452]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:29.952 --> 00:21:35.277]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:35.557 --> 00:21:41.443]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:21:42.204 --> 00:21:43.445]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:43.465 --> 00:21:45.167]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:21:45.187 --> 00:21:45.608]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:45.628 --> 00:21:47.651]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:21:47.671 --> 00:21:47.731]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:59.708 --> 00:22:01.670]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[00:22:01.931 --> 00:22:04.974]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:22:05.254 --> 00:22:10.019]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:22:10.339 --> 00:22:13.082]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:22:13.323 --> 00:22:18.008]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[00:22:18.288 --> 00:22:20.190]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:30.594]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[00:22:30.974 --> 00:22:35.676]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[00:22:36.037 --> 00:22:39.558]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[00:22:39.798 --> 00:22:41.939]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[00:22:42.259 --> 00:22:44.400]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings,
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.382]  We'll even refund the shipping charge.
[00:22:46.682 --> 00:22:49.785]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[00:22:50.026 --> 00:22:50.907]  What are you waiting for?
[00:22:51.087 --> 00:22:51.787]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[00:22:52.008 --> 00:22:52.208]  That's 1-888-873-7371.
[00:22:52.228 --> 00:22:52.388]  Today!
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.782]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:03.423 --> 00:23:12.353]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:12.794 --> 00:23:20.002]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:20.712 --> 00:23:26.217]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:23:26.697 --> 00:23:37.526]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:23:38.287 --> 00:23:40.309]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:23:40.849 --> 00:23:43.691]  For more information call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:24:10.371 --> 00:24:15.837]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[00:24:15.857 --> 00:24:21.262]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[00:24:21.302 --> 00:24:23.784]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[00:24:24.004 --> 00:24:26.427]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[00:24:26.707 --> 00:24:29.210]  We fired once more and they'd forget to run it.
[00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.852]  On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:24:31.932 --> 00:24:32.473]  Welcome back!
[00:24:34.588 --> 00:24:40.030]  We look down the river and we see the British come, and there must have been a hundred of them beatin' on the drum.
[00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:42.731]  They step so high and then the bugles ring.
[00:24:42.751 --> 00:24:47.153]  Alright, getting back into neo-cons and what's been lauded as helping counter 9-11 truth.
[00:24:47.513 --> 00:24:48.474]  Very important story.
[00:24:48.494 --> 00:24:58.117]  I'm gonna get into endgame and really what the film encompasses and play the audio from the trailer that's now up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the next segment.
[00:24:59.978 --> 00:25:04.100]  Continuing here with this new, clearly fake Bin Laden tape, just on its face.
[00:25:08.436 --> 00:25:11.779]  But whether you think it's Bin Laden or not, it's really beside the point.
[00:25:11.839 --> 00:25:16.083]  If Bin Laden was dead, it would be necessary to perpetuate the myth anyway.
[00:25:16.623 --> 00:25:23.869]  The thing to bear in mind here is that Osama has never failed in ensuring his tapes get released at the most politically opportune times.
[00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:28.573]  Not for Al-Qaeda, but for the neocons and the Bush administration.
[00:25:28.613 --> 00:25:35.219]  In addition, the security services and intel center have been caught on numerous occasions doctoring Bin Laden tapes.
[00:25:35.259 --> 00:25:36.020]  That's admitted now.
[00:25:37.384 --> 00:25:41.525]  And passing the footage off they filmed or as originating from Al-Qaeda.
[00:25:43.726 --> 00:25:52.569]  Again, Bin Laden tapes and passing off footage they filmed as originating from Al-Qaeda as well as claiming that six-year-old footage is new material.
[00:25:52.829 --> 00:25:53.670]  They do that all the time.
[00:25:54.550 --> 00:26:06.834]  Their credibility on this issue has been shot to pieces again and again and again and only the supremely naive or the winning dupe would lend any credence to the authenticity of the new tape.
[00:26:07.797 --> 00:26:16.285]  And think about it, they release, it's gotta be 15-20 times every few months, re-edited 2000-2001 videos.
[00:26:16.385 --> 00:26:20.588]  And then it's big national news, ABC, CNN, Fox, they all know it's fake.
[00:26:20.929 --> 00:26:24.772]  And then a day later, there's a very quiet retraction, oh, we believe that was an old take.
[00:26:26.272 --> 00:26:41.270]  You can look at it, it's always the same tape, always the cave in the background, always the green background, always those two tapes, always re-edited, always the same thing he's saying, and they know it, but again, the people that aren't paying attention are just halfway watching, so, oh, it's Bin Laden again!
[00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:43.973]  It's amazing propaganda!
[00:26:45.993 --> 00:27:03.520]  First and foremost, in the same vein as the History Channel hit piece, the tape is an attempt to rescue the tattered and torn credibility of the official 9-11 fairy tale, as well as providing a media distraction to obfuscate 9-11 truth events that kick off today at Ground Zero and continue on to next week's anniversary.
[00:27:04.142 --> 00:27:14.285]  A new Zogby poll, released yesterday, shows that 51% of Americans, up from 45% last year, want Bush and Cheney to be directly investigated for their actions on 9-11.
[00:27:15.105 --> 00:27:21.327]  And 67% fault the 9-11 Commission for the failure to probe the anomalies and the collapse of WTC7.
[00:27:23.588 --> 00:27:25.708]  That's in a mainline, highly respected poll.
[00:27:25.768 --> 00:27:28.749]  It's actually far worse, because most people getting calls aren't going to answer truthfully.
[00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:29.970]  It's, you know, did the government do it?
[00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.430]  Oh no, thank you, bye bye.
[00:27:32.848 --> 00:27:38.429]  Hours after the release of the poll, Bin Laden pops up and promises us a new editorial comment.
[00:27:38.729 --> 00:27:39.429]  Coincidence!
[00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.430]  Precisely the same thing happened last year.
[00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:49.071]  On May 23rd, 2006, a Zogby poll was released showing nearly half of Americans wanted a new 9-11 investigation.
[00:27:49.251 --> 00:27:54.032]  The very next day, Bin Laden popped up to reinforce the official version and threaten new attacks.
[00:27:54.893 --> 00:27:56.973]  Can lightning strike twice in the same place?
[00:27:57.553 --> 00:28:01.034]  The Osama tapes are about as genuine as a used car salesman's
[00:28:03.314 --> 00:28:07.898]  And it goes on, and have been proven fraudulent on countless occasions.
[00:28:09.179 --> 00:28:16.806]  They are nothing more than crude propaganda unleashed in a desperate move to put the genie of what really happened on 9-11 back in the bottle.
[00:28:17.186 --> 00:28:20.570]  But remember, it's crude propaganda for a crude public.
[00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:21.330]  You understand that?
[00:28:22.591 --> 00:28:24.953]  They've got higher-grade propaganda for the intelligentsia.
[00:28:25.174 --> 00:28:26.655]  There's many different flavors of it.
[00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:30.362]  But for the general public, man, just here is the Batman!
[00:28:30.662 --> 00:28:32.164]  Ooh, booga booga!
[00:28:32.524 --> 00:28:34.606]  Ooh, ooh, ooh!
[00:28:34.966 --> 00:28:37.249]  He's gonna get you, he's in the closet!
[00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:41.933]  But this new one is not a re-edited tape that I've ever seen.
[00:28:41.953 --> 00:28:43.695]  It is a clear fake.
[00:28:43.715 --> 00:28:48.299]  It is, it's not even a... It looks like Final Fantasy graphics.
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.902]  I mean, it is a clear video fake.
[00:28:50.922 --> 00:28:52.143]  It is, it is a cartoon.
[00:28:54.193 --> 00:28:55.513]  I mean, it's like it's obvious.
[00:28:55.553 --> 00:28:57.014]  It's like it's a sick joke to them!
[00:28:57.694 --> 00:28:58.534]  I can't believe it!
[00:28:58.874 --> 00:29:00.054]  They could make it look real!
[00:29:00.734 --> 00:29:02.535]  They've chosen to make it look like a cartoon!
[00:29:03.035 --> 00:29:03.675]  I've blown it up.
[00:29:03.735 --> 00:29:05.215]  I've looked at it very closely, folks.
[00:29:05.975 --> 00:29:06.916]  And it's a cartoon!
[00:29:08.316 --> 00:29:11.056]  Oh, man, we're in trouble, folks, when they're showing cartoons.
[00:29:11.197 --> 00:29:12.397]  I mean, come on!
[00:29:12.837 --> 00:29:16.778]  They admit they show the computer generation and said it was real two years ago!
[00:29:16.798 --> 00:29:18.998]  Of Muhammad Ata?!
[00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:21.899]  Case closed!
[00:29:22.099 --> 00:29:22.619]  Documented!
[00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:23.119]  Proven!
[00:29:25.248 --> 00:29:40.436]  For those who still scoff at the notion the neocons would be behind the release of new tips, consider the fact that the Pentagon admitted that they undertook a propaganda campaign, that's a quote, to magnify the role the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, al-Zaqqari, which was the target of a U.S.
[00:29:40.456 --> 00:29:41.017]  home audience.
[00:29:41.037 --> 00:29:41.697]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.482 --> 00:29:52.423]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.883 --> 00:29:54.384]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.376 --> 00:29:58.157]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:02.199]  Hey, Emily.
[00:30:02.499 --> 00:30:03.400]  Wow, you look great.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:04.840]  I feel great.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.001]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[00:30:07.381 --> 00:30:07.702]  Really?
[00:30:07.882 --> 00:30:08.362]  What is it?
[00:30:08.482 --> 00:30:08.942]  How does it work?
[00:30:09.062 --> 00:30:16.005]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[00:30:16.325 --> 00:30:18.606]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[00:30:18.987 --> 00:30:24.089]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[00:30:24.629 --> 00:30:25.090]  That's it?
[00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:26.912]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[00:30:27.212 --> 00:30:27.913]  It is easy.
[00:30:28.213 --> 00:30:34.880]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.482]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[00:30:36.682 --> 00:30:37.463]  That's amazing!
[00:30:37.803 --> 00:30:43.149]  And, the bentonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:30:43.429 --> 00:30:43.710]  Wow!
[00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:44.971]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[00:30:45.391 --> 00:30:48.393]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:52.376]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[00:30:52.596 --> 00:30:53.076]  Or call 1-800-317-9547.
[00:30:53.096 --> 00:30:53.336]  That's 800-317-9547.
[00:31:01.451 --> 00:31:03.292]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:31:03.432 --> 00:31:08.596]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:31:08.796 --> 00:31:10.137]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:31:10.397 --> 00:31:18.582]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:31:18.782 --> 00:31:24.586]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:31:24.606 --> 00:31:26.468]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:31:26.548 --> 00:31:28.669]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:31:28.729 --> 00:31:28.989]  I think so.
[00:31:44.394 --> 00:31:45.715]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.
[00:31:45.915 --> 00:31:50.977]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:31:51.017 --> 00:31:54.959]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened.
[00:32:12.686 --> 00:32:13.227]  We're good to go.
[00:32:32.602 --> 00:32:37.304]  The last word monastery spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y or call us at 1-800-275-1126.
[00:32:37.324 --> 00:32:39.686]  That's 1-800-275-1126 or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, New York 14735.
[00:32:39.746 --> 00:32:42.648]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:32:42.688 --> 00:32:44.889]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:33:06.886 --> 00:33:14.992]  Alright, I'm going to get back into the latest fake Bin Laden video and the evidence of how all the others have been fakes or re-edits or computer generations.
[00:33:15.092 --> 00:33:16.173]  It's a whole mix of them.
[00:33:17.594 --> 00:33:20.076]  And what it means that they're putting out this type of propaganda.
[00:33:20.096 --> 00:33:22.778]  What it means, what that says about the American people.
[00:33:23.679 --> 00:33:24.920]  What it says about humanity.
[00:33:26.019 --> 00:33:27.140]  Then I'm going to get into Endgame.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.501]  I'm going to play the audio from the new trailer.
[00:33:29.541 --> 00:33:30.562]  It's a lot more powerful.
[00:33:31.162 --> 00:33:34.985]  Up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:33:35.005 --> 00:33:36.606]  And I'd ask you to get that trailer out.
[00:33:37.046 --> 00:33:37.947]  It's the first trailer.
[00:33:37.987 --> 00:33:39.248]  It's really just the intro of the film.
[00:33:39.268 --> 00:33:42.550]  We've got two other shorter, more highly produced trailers coming out next week.
[00:33:44.051 --> 00:33:48.334]  But it's right now up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:33:49.545 --> 00:34:01.781]  You know, you can get my books and videos and materials we carry at InfoWars.com, but there's another place if you live around the Central Texas area to physically buy my books and videos and hundreds of other videos and books.
[00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:03.884]  Really the best selection I've seen anywhere.
[00:34:04.898 --> 00:34:14.382]  And ladies and gentlemen, that's Brave New Books, based right here in Austin, Texas, but they've got an online video and bookstore that is bar none huge.
[00:34:14.902 --> 00:34:23.225]  It's bravenewbookstore.com, bravenewbookstore.com, with a secure online shopping cart right there for you at bravenewbookstore.com.
[00:34:25.266 --> 00:34:35.568]  Or you can simply give them a call and ask about any titles you're interested in or any videos or book titles you're interested in.
[00:34:35.588 --> 00:34:36.868]  1-866-516-6623.
[00:34:36.888 --> 00:34:37.148]  866-516-6623.
[00:34:37.188 --> 00:34:40.629]  Just really great folks and great sponsors of this broadcast.
[00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:49.450]  Right now they're carrying a great 9-11 video, Towers of Deception, the media cover-up of 9-11 by Barry Zwicker, and Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.191]  Normally $15, now only $10 by John Perkins.
[00:34:53.978 --> 00:34:55.479]  Towers of Deception, by the way, is normally $25.
[00:34:55.519 --> 00:34:56.099]  It's $19.95 right now.
[00:34:56.159 --> 00:35:01.982]  So that's just a few of the things you'll find at www.bravenewbookstore.com.
[00:35:02.002 --> 00:35:05.343]  And right down on the UT Drag, you can't miss them if you're here locally and want to go there.
[00:35:07.014 --> 00:35:10.936]  Also, you need to get Terror Storm Final Cut.
[00:35:11.036 --> 00:35:24.363]  They've got it at Brave New Books, but you can also get that at Infowars.com and get big discounts when you get it with Loose Change 2nd Edition, or 9-11 Mysteries Demolitions, or America Freedom to Fascism.
[00:35:24.663 --> 00:35:27.244]  You can get some of my films as low as $4.95, like American Dictators.
[00:35:30.064 --> 00:35:34.686]  4.95, it's an excellent film exposing the false left-right paradigm, showing how they stage elections.
[00:35:35.206 --> 00:35:37.087]  And we've got them priced to move.
[00:35:37.107 --> 00:35:38.988]  4.95 when you get it with one of my other videos.
[00:35:39.649 --> 00:35:46.792]  I've got all the best titles, all the best books that I found out there at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or simply call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:35:46.812 --> 00:35:47.072]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:35:47.092 --> 00:35:50.093]  You know, I want to get back into all the bin Laden news.
[00:35:59.531 --> 00:36:04.253]  And not just that it's a new fake tape, but what that means that they're releasing fake tapes.
[00:36:10.155 --> 00:36:11.975]  I want to play the trailer, though.
[00:36:11.995 --> 00:36:14.036]  And again, this is just the new long-form trailer.
[00:36:14.056 --> 00:36:15.097]  We've got to get something out there.
[00:36:15.117 --> 00:36:18.938]  We've been so busy with other things, we're not done doing the teaser trailer.
[00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:21.859]  There's a 60-second trailer and a minute-and-a-half trailer that will be released in the next few weeks.
[00:36:23.142 --> 00:36:25.324]  But this is the long-form trailer.
[00:36:25.344 --> 00:36:26.946]  Really, this is the intro from the film.
[00:36:27.206 --> 00:36:29.168]  And the film intros with an H.G.
[00:36:29.188 --> 00:36:38.336]  Wells quote from his book, The New World Order, where he says that countless people will hate the New World Order and will die protesting against it.
[00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:39.777]  So it starts in darkness with that.
[00:36:40.157 --> 00:36:47.624]  Then it cuts to Smedley Butler and the Marine Corps General, Brigadier General, speaking out against how the fascists tried to overthrow things here in the U.S.
[00:36:47.884 --> 00:36:48.705]  with the Bush family.
[00:36:49.651 --> 00:36:55.416]  Then it goes into, you'll hear Eisenhower speaking, then Kennedy, then Bush Sr., and then it just goes right through.
[00:36:55.456 --> 00:37:01.802]  And you'll hear music, and in the background it's showing news articles about the Rockefellers funding the eugenics in Germany.
[00:37:03.504 --> 00:37:06.046]  But let's just go ahead and play the in-game trailer.
[00:37:25.595 --> 00:37:33.460]  I appeared before the Congressional Committee to tell what I knew of activities which might lead to an attempt to set up a fascist dictatorship.
[00:37:34.401 --> 00:37:39.624]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[00:37:40.225 --> 00:37:44.547]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
[00:37:45.528 --> 00:37:54.774]  And we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[00:37:55.695 --> 00:37:59.757]  President Bush signed a formal agreement that will end the United States as we know it.
[00:38:00.518 --> 00:38:03.239]  And he took the step without approval from either the U.S.
[00:38:03.279 --> 00:38:05.941]  Congress or the people of the United States.
[00:38:06.541 --> 00:38:10.604]  The secret organizations of the world power elite are no longer secret.
[00:38:10.624 --> 00:38:13.425]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:38:14.046 --> 00:38:16.307]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:38:19.009 --> 00:38:19.929]  I'm Jim Tucker.
[00:38:19.949 --> 00:38:22.911]  I've chased Bilderberg for 30 years.
[00:38:23.872 --> 00:38:26.013]  I'll never give up the chase.
[00:38:27.534 --> 00:38:33.298]  Bilderberg planned for the whole world as nothing less than world government.
[00:38:34.299 --> 00:38:36.140]  I'm not comfortable with that at all.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.861]  Who elected these guys to run the planet?
[00:38:39.582 --> 00:38:40.563]  They are the elitists.
[00:38:41.504 --> 00:38:45.126]  They feel they should run the world for their own selfish interests.
[00:38:46.967 --> 00:38:49.649]  Now we can see a new world coming into view.
[00:38:50.882 --> 00:38:54.803]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[00:38:55.764 --> 00:39:02.526]  Bloomberg is making great progress toward a world government, and only an educated and informed public can stop them in their tracks.
[00:39:02.746 --> 00:39:09.188]  David Rockefeller admits in his own memoirs that he wants to destroy the United States!
[00:39:09.588 --> 00:39:10.128]  He's a traitor!
[00:39:11.325 --> 00:39:13.908]  It's good to be back at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:39:14.048 --> 00:39:19.995]  As Pete mentioned, I've been a member for a long time and was actually a director for some period of time.
[00:39:20.735 --> 00:39:24.239]  I never mentioned that when I was campaigning for re-election back home in Wyoming.
[00:39:25.439 --> 00:39:28.481]  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories.
[00:39:28.621 --> 00:39:32.424]  I need you to move off the property, please.
[00:39:32.584 --> 00:39:33.345]  Some shots worth five.
[00:39:33.365 --> 00:39:36.247]  There's Mildenberger's right there.
[00:39:48.815 --> 00:39:52.318]  The Trans-Texas Corridor is a battle part because we stopped here in Texas.
[00:39:52.378 --> 00:39:56.501]  We stopped the New World Order riot here in Texas.
[00:39:57.562 --> 00:39:58.883]  This thing started here.
[00:40:00.904 --> 00:40:04.166]  And to save this country, we kill this damn thing here.
[00:40:16.559 --> 00:40:29.272]  There is a chance for the President of the United States to carry out a phrase his father used, and that is a New World Order.
[00:40:31.946 --> 00:40:34.468]  Your New World Order will fall!
[00:40:35.049 --> 00:40:37.251]  Humanity will defeat him!
[00:40:37.611 --> 00:40:38.532]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:09.336]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, that is the audio from the trailer that really is just the intro to the film.
[00:41:11.538 --> 00:41:12.999]  And it really is my best documentary.
[00:41:13.299 --> 00:41:17.003]  Each one gets better, but now we're having exponential quality increases.
[00:41:17.023 --> 00:41:21.487]  The difference between Martial Law and the film before that is huge.
[00:41:22.007 --> 00:41:25.230]  And the gulf between Martial Law and Terror Storm is even more massive.
[00:41:25.842 --> 00:41:30.766]  And now this film is, um, Terraform really is the definitive work on government-sponsored terror.
[00:41:30.806 --> 00:41:35.009]  The wide view and all the admitted examples is how it begins.
[00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:38.091]  So we found it to be the most effective at waking people up.
[00:41:38.111 --> 00:41:38.972]  So it's a great film.
[00:41:39.512 --> 00:41:44.456]  But it's different from this film in the production quality, the skills we've learned, everything we've done.
[00:41:44.476 --> 00:41:46.297]  I mean, this was shot in Istanbul, Turkey.
[00:41:46.317 --> 00:41:51.341]  This was shot in Canada, shot in Texas, shot in New York, shot all over the place.
[00:41:52.165 --> 00:41:53.586]  And it's shot in high-definition.
[00:41:54.207 --> 00:42:00.531]  Most people don't have high-definition players, so we're going to wait for the second edition to come out in a few years and have it in high-definition for folks.
[00:42:00.551 --> 00:42:01.632]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:42:01.652 --> 00:42:02.732]  It has a high-def look.
[00:42:02.772 --> 00:42:06.435]  The color is just the quality of the film.
[00:42:06.535 --> 00:42:08.476]  And I'm not even going to say how much I spent on this movie.
[00:42:09.357 --> 00:42:10.938]  You know I spent around $100,000.
[00:42:10.978 --> 00:42:11.979]  That's a lot of money for me.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.961]  Assumably that's nothing, but that's a lot for me.
[00:42:17.463 --> 00:42:20.565]  On the Terror Storm, and I'm not even going to say how much the game cost.
[00:42:21.721 --> 00:42:27.846]  Actually licensing the footage and actually going out and just flying everywhere and working on it.
[00:42:27.866 --> 00:42:30.908]  Just paying a couple people to work on it with myself for a year.
[00:42:30.928 --> 00:42:32.549]  I keep saying 14 months.
[00:42:32.609 --> 00:42:34.030]  I mean intensely for 14 months.
[00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:40.695]  We've been working really for about... We've been working on this film about 16, 17 months.
[00:42:40.755 --> 00:42:42.236]  Not quite a year and a half.
[00:42:45.158 --> 00:42:46.219]  I'm still working on it.
[00:42:46.239 --> 00:42:47.540]  I've got the cover done a week ago.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:50.042]  I'm trying to write the text for it and make the trailers but
[00:42:51.608 --> 00:42:52.528]  Actual production.
[00:42:53.669 --> 00:42:54.389]  Sixteen months.
[00:42:58.671 --> 00:42:59.791]  And what does the film cover?
[00:43:00.151 --> 00:43:01.672]  The film is really a quest.
[00:43:01.892 --> 00:43:04.493]  It's the sum of what I've learned in my life.
[00:43:05.213 --> 00:43:09.355]  The sum of what I've learned in my quest to investigate the New World Order.
[00:43:10.435 --> 00:43:13.916]  And the film is really three films in one, like all my films.
[00:43:14.416 --> 00:43:14.796]  It's long.
[00:43:14.836 --> 00:43:16.097]  It's two hours, twenty minutes long.
[00:43:18.757 --> 00:43:24.839]  But everybody we talked to, and I interrogated them when they left the last three showings, said it was the best they'd ever seen me do, that they were shaken.
[00:43:25.519 --> 00:43:31.681]  My father was speechless, very depressed looking, but said it was an excellent film, but that it really shook him up.
[00:43:31.741 --> 00:43:42.984]  My lawyer, who is listed as one of the top ten lawyers in Texas Monthly, I mean he's a big high-powered litigator, really a friend of the family's while I'm blessed to know him, was shaken up after it and very upset.
[00:43:43.384 --> 00:43:44.044]  He's a smart guy.
[00:43:46.494 --> 00:43:48.935]  And, uh, my mother was really freaked out by it.
[00:43:48.995 --> 00:43:56.136]  Everybody... And they'd seen other films, like, yeah, that's interesting, yeah, that's kind of scary, or yeah... My mom didn't like my films I was making five, six, seven years ago.
[00:43:56.416 --> 00:43:59.017]  They're good information, but, you know, kind of obnoxious how I presented them.
[00:43:59.497 --> 00:44:02.097]  This one, everybody's shaking up after they see Endgame.
[00:44:02.897 --> 00:44:06.058]  All I've gotten is good reviews, but that it's also very upsetting.
[00:44:06.298 --> 00:44:07.438]  Hey, it has to be told.
[00:44:07.718 --> 00:44:09.019]  The evil has to be exposed.
[00:44:09.719 --> 00:44:13.540]  And it is probably one of the most... I'm not going to mince words.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:15.300]  It's the darkest film ever made.
[00:44:17.006 --> 00:44:19.788]  But it isn't dark in a fake horror movie angle.
[00:44:20.009 --> 00:44:32.919]  I mean, it's dark in that this is the truth, this is what you face, and this film, if it gets out to people, if you get it, if you spread it, if you show it to people, will make history.
[00:44:33.639 --> 00:44:39.664]  Because the globalists have been quite public about their master plan to kill 80 plus percent of us and bring in a one world government to do it.
[00:44:41.426 --> 00:44:45.389]  Their aim to build a new world order is so they can carry out their great work, which is
[00:44:46.289 --> 00:44:56.515]  The control freak's ultimate expression of selfishness and wickedness and that is to kill 80% of the world population so the elite can have a corner on the future.
[00:44:56.795 --> 00:44:59.957]  So the elite can for sure dominate the future.
[00:45:01.568 --> 00:45:13.794]  So that the elite will never have to struggle with a middle class or a new renaissance or a new elite that could overthrow them and displace them because they know all elites get decadent, get inbred, get lazy, and get overthrown.
[00:45:14.094 --> 00:45:20.337]  And this elite's cold-bloodedly doing what the Romans would do on a smaller scale when Hannibal resisted them.
[00:45:21.918 --> 00:45:22.598]  Was it Carthage?
[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:27.122]  Going from memory here, Watson, when you're doing an article on this, look it up please.
[00:45:27.763 --> 00:45:39.950]  Went in and salted the earth, killed every man, woman, and child, and then put salt, brought in tons of sea salt, which was very valuable then, and dumped it into their fields, so that for hundreds of years they couldn't grow crops.
[00:45:41.351 --> 00:45:42.052]  Salt the earth.
[00:45:44.654 --> 00:45:49.877]  And that's what the Israelites were commanded to do with particularly wicked tribes when they were taking over their land.
[00:45:50.532 --> 00:45:51.973]  You know, God would tell them, kill everybody.
[00:45:51.993 --> 00:45:53.754]  Well, that's what the elite are doing.
[00:45:53.774 --> 00:45:56.196]  They're saying, we are going to kill all of you.
[00:45:56.837 --> 00:45:57.717]  We're only going to leave about 400.
[00:45:57.998 --> 00:46:03.942]  And by the way, now, that was the view 10, 20 years ago, and that was their public statements.
[00:46:04.322 --> 00:46:08.705]  Now they're saying, actually, we plan on killing almost everyone.
[00:46:08.765 --> 00:46:10.947]  We're probably going to reduce things down to less than a million.
[00:46:12.388 --> 00:46:14.750]  And then now the new school of thought is saying, no, no, no, no.
[00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:16.071]  Everyone dies.
[00:46:18.965 --> 00:46:31.953]  And you talk to these professors and sociologists and psychologists and anthropologists and their followers, their graduate students, and they write papers defending Pianca and Singer and other evil New World Order pushers of this dehumanization.
[00:46:32.653 --> 00:46:34.374]  They say, well, we have to, we can't die.
[00:46:34.394 --> 00:46:39.558]  We have to stay here and oversee it all, but then we'll kill ourselves.
[00:46:41.058 --> 00:46:41.899]  And it's sad, but
[00:46:43.101 --> 00:46:44.022]  We're willing to do it.
[00:46:45.262 --> 00:46:49.125]  They post things and they write articles about, I'll kill my family when the time comes.
[00:46:50.846 --> 00:46:53.568]  It's sad that my children will have to go, but we're ready.
[00:46:53.648 --> 00:46:58.691]  I mean, these are the sickest... But by the way, Tuesday night we premiered it in Austin.
[00:47:00.192 --> 00:47:04.175]  Rob Jacobson left at about 10 when the first one showed.
[00:47:04.335 --> 00:47:07.497]  We showed a double feature, a Terror Storm final cut on that first showing.
[00:47:08.524 --> 00:47:18.608]  And he went home and he called me in the morning and he said, oh my God, he said, I was just watching Jon Stewart and they had an author on there who just said, let's get this out of the way.
[00:47:18.969 --> 00:47:23.991]  We're going to be better off when we're all dead and all humans are gone and it's going to happen.
[00:47:24.711 --> 00:47:31.654]  And then he went into the book and I heard it on NPR and I forgot his name, never wrote it down, didn't try to get him on.
[00:47:32.643 --> 00:47:37.767]  Then Michael McWhorter came in here about a month ago and said, I heard this guy on the radio, and he played me an audio file.
[00:47:37.787 --> 00:47:39.829]  I think we gave it to Aaron, but Aaron isn't back in.
[00:47:39.849 --> 00:47:42.230]  Oh, we're so busy.
[00:47:42.271 --> 00:47:44.252]  I mentioned it to Aaron yesterday, and he didn't respond.
[00:47:45.433 --> 00:47:46.294]  What's the guy's name?
[00:47:46.314 --> 00:47:47.214]  Can somebody call in?
[00:47:47.234 --> 00:47:55.301]  Or can somebody email trey at InfoWars.com or Mike at InfoWars, or post it in the message board, and I'll give it to the network.
[00:47:55.661 --> 00:47:59.183]  Because, I mean, that Jon Stewart was Tuesday night, so it's got to be out there.
[00:47:59.203 --> 00:48:01.045]  I've been too busy to go find it or do anything with it.
[00:48:01.525 --> 00:48:02.366]  I just thought of that.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:04.415]  Paul Watson's listening right now.
[00:48:04.455 --> 00:48:05.235]  Paul, you can go find it.
[00:48:05.255 --> 00:48:06.855]  It was Tuesday night's Jon Stewart.
[00:48:07.696 --> 00:48:09.436]  And this author's all over the place.
[00:48:09.476 --> 00:48:10.577]  He's saying, kill everyone.
[00:48:11.177 --> 00:48:17.740]  But see, Rob Jacobson went home from the film, my editor, my main editor, and he turns on television.
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:23.762]  He turned it on and Jon Stewart was introducing the guy and basically agreeing with it and saying it was great.
[00:48:25.365 --> 00:48:36.191]  And then Colbert, two weeks ago, made fun of the former Forbes writer, who quit, over the fact they wouldn't let him write a story about the Global Master Plan to exterminate the majority of us.
[00:48:37.171 --> 00:48:39.372]  See, Colbert, they're not good, folks.
[00:48:39.392 --> 00:48:48.737]  As much as you like Colbert laughing at Bush, or as much as you like Stewart doing it, and I know that some of their producers listen to the show, and it's still, though, their instinct is to go with the elite.
[00:48:51.172 --> 00:48:53.113]  That's why you notice they're talking about Oberman.
[00:48:53.473 --> 00:48:59.616]  He's no good to attack Hillary once she's in, so he's kind of announcing he's looking at leaving and just doing football and baseball now.
[00:48:59.796 --> 00:49:01.357]  Which, by the way, he used to do a great job of.
[00:49:01.757 --> 00:49:02.158]  Baseball.
[00:49:02.338 --> 00:49:03.638]  One of the best out there I've ever seen.
[00:49:03.958 --> 00:49:05.779]  Yes, I used to watch sports, folks.
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.160]  I know why you like it.
[00:49:08.281 --> 00:49:10.602]  It's fun to be mindless and sit there and drink a beer and watch it.
[00:49:10.822 --> 00:49:15.164]  But the point is, that's why he's going bye-bye in the next year.
[00:49:16.545 --> 00:49:17.465]  Leaving countdown.
[00:49:18.185 --> 00:49:19.246]  Number two show on cable.
[00:49:21.135 --> 00:49:24.856]  Cable News, and rising, by the way, to be number one, because there's no need.
[00:49:24.896 --> 00:49:27.497]  He can't attack Democrats once it's in that paradigm.
[00:49:28.638 --> 00:49:29.738]  But see, it's everywhere.
[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:40.562]  You don't know where you heard it, but you have the idea that we've got to reduce the world's population.
[00:49:40.622 --> 00:49:42.263]  It's been co-located into you.
[00:49:43.783 --> 00:49:59.098]  And so, Endgame goes through the history of the New World Order, going back about 250 years, right through Napoleon, the Rothschilds, the rise of the Central Banks, how the CFR took over the United States, the Roundtable Group, how this British model of hidden empire runs the planet.
[00:50:01.067 --> 00:50:02.528]  The Anglo-American establishment.
[00:50:02.568 --> 00:50:04.029]  Then we go, hey, we're going to Bilderberg.
[00:50:04.049 --> 00:50:05.230]  We're going to show you the elite.
[00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:06.351]  We show you their documents.
[00:50:06.371 --> 00:50:18.740]  We show you how they set up the EU, how they're setting up the American Union, how they're going to use the roads as the main taxing mechanism, how their own internal documents from SPP meetings say they're going to set up a carbon tax in a police state.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.862]  Then we spend the second half of the film
[00:50:23.183 --> 00:50:25.385]  Getting into the history of government extermination.
[00:50:25.745 --> 00:50:30.129]  How the number one cause of death, of unnatural death, is governments killing you.
[00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:32.411]  We say 150 million in the film.
[00:50:32.471 --> 00:50:34.293]  It's really over 200 million, but we're conservative.
[00:50:34.613 --> 00:50:35.274]  Last century.
[00:50:35.634 --> 00:50:41.679]  And we walk right through the history of eugenics, right in to the transhumanist and the future.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:50.087]  You now know with this film, which isn't even available yet on DVD, you now know what their master plan is.
[00:50:51.181 --> 00:50:52.281]  No one has put it together.
[00:50:52.862 --> 00:50:55.282]  I wish others had done it before if we'd have a better chance of beating them.
[00:50:56.022 --> 00:51:00.084]  But it was left to this... this dumb Texan to do it, and I've done it.
[00:51:00.104 --> 00:51:07.646]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.066 --> 00:51:10.007]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.387 --> 00:51:17.989]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.706 --> 00:51:25.750]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:37.596]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.896 --> 00:51:41.398]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.859 --> 00:51:43.800]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:47.982]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:04.662]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:04.702 --> 00:52:08.744]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:08.864 --> 00:52:11.426]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:11.486 --> 00:52:13.807]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:14.007 --> 00:52:22.452]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:22.512 --> 00:52:23.833]  The Brookie Light is different.
[00:52:23.973 --> 00:52:27.995]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:28.015 --> 00:52:28.475]  We're good to go!
[00:52:48.387 --> 00:52:53.073]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium, 888-03-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:53.093 --> 00:52:54.054]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:01.025 --> 00:53:03.529]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:53:03.749 --> 00:53:08.015]  Honeybees are now mysteriously vanishing at an astonishing pace across the entire country.
[00:53:08.175 --> 00:53:11.099]  Why is this urgent message about honeybees so desperately important?
[00:53:11.319 --> 00:53:12.280]  The answer is easy.
[00:53:12.421 --> 00:53:18.569]  You see, honeybees produce a unique compound, fed only to the queen, that makes her live six times longer than other bees in the hive.
[00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:22.871]  Some researchers now believe the compound may have miraculous effects on humans as well.
[00:53:23.071 --> 00:53:29.013]  The compound is called Royal Jelly, and is now available in an all-new, ultra-purified form called Gelosene Gold.
[00:53:29.193 --> 00:53:34.595]  The product has been designed for purity-conscious Americans who are concerned about contaminated Royal Jelly entering the U.S.
[00:53:34.615 --> 00:53:35.096]  from Asia.
[00:53:35.296 --> 00:53:39.657]  Solutions from Science is the only company authorized to sell Gelosene Gold in the U.S.
[00:53:39.878 --> 00:53:43.439]  They believe it to be the purest, most potent, and safest form of Royal Jelly in the world.
[00:53:43.439 --> 00:53:43.639]  I think so.
[00:54:10.001 --> 00:54:16.285]  I was sittin' in traffic, listenin' to the radio.
[00:54:16.706 --> 00:54:22.449]  George Strait was sayin', the seashores of old Mexico.
[00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:28.012]  It sounded so good, I got an idea.
[00:54:28.112 --> 00:54:31.935]  I'm gonna go there since they're all over here.
[00:54:32.235 --> 00:54:36.658]  The Lost Star State should be renamed Texico.
[00:54:37.258 --> 00:54:38.559]  So long, Texas!
[00:54:40.483 --> 00:54:43.866]  Endgame really is an amazing film.
[00:54:45.086 --> 00:54:47.328]  It's so important.
[00:54:47.408 --> 00:54:51.611]  We all instinctively know that the elite hate us.
[00:54:51.631 --> 00:54:52.972]  We know they're poisoning us.
[00:55:09.551 --> 00:55:11.652]  You talk to anybody, they say, oh, population control.
[00:55:11.692 --> 00:55:12.813]  That's the goal of global government.
[00:55:12.833 --> 00:55:16.274]  People who don't even believe in global government will say, everybody knows they want to kill us.
[00:55:16.734 --> 00:55:21.777]  That's because they've heard about the Prince Philip quotes and the Ted Turner quotes and all these books that have been written about it.
[00:55:22.457 --> 00:55:26.579]  And it pops up here and there, and it's really a big undertone to everything.
[00:55:27.119 --> 00:55:29.200]  But I know when I was going to college right here in Austin...
[00:55:30.922 --> 00:55:38.489]  That I would, it didn't matter if it was math class, it didn't matter if it was psychology, it didn't matter if it was anthropology.
[00:55:38.529 --> 00:55:46.657]  I remember teachers, instructors, professors just stopping in the middle of a talk about calculus and going, you know, there's too many people, we've got to get rid of some people.
[00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:48.439]  I mean, this is their religion.
[00:55:49.259 --> 00:55:52.903]  This is what, frankly, the majority of people, even though they're in line to be killed,
[00:55:53.787 --> 00:55:54.268]  Uh, want.
[00:55:54.668 --> 00:56:10.343]  And that's, and it gets into the one-child policy, how they're setting those up in the West now, and claiming it'll be a tax on more than one child, and it gets into the global warming fraud, and how they're going, that it's man-made, and that carbon dioxide is bad, and the fact that it's really the sun that's causing it.
[00:56:11.858 --> 00:56:17.323]  It just starts with the history of the New World Order, how they set things up, how they took control of the banks, how they got control of the U.S.
[00:56:17.363 --> 00:56:29.353]  and most other nations, and how they're setting up a total world government without a Bill of Rights or Constitution, with no due process, so that they can then come in with draconian social workers and all of these surveillance systems
[00:56:30.353 --> 00:56:32.195]  Already in England and some U.S.
[00:56:32.215 --> 00:56:39.819]  states, they have children at two enrolled automatically on probation, watched by social workers because they have crime genes.
[00:56:40.099 --> 00:56:48.764]  We have the news articles, we have people testifying before the legislature in Texas that kids have bad genes, that's why they're on two-thirds of the foster kids are on drugs.
[00:56:49.164 --> 00:56:51.586]  I mean, it just goes through all of it and gives you the proof!
[00:56:52.327 --> 00:57:00.034]  And it shows how our government financed China to kill all those people, and how they supported Pol Pot, and how they're following the eugenics.
[00:57:01.956 --> 00:57:03.137]  It's an unbelievable film.
[00:57:04.058 --> 00:57:16.910]  And it goes right through how the eugenicists in the 50s, after World War II, founded transhumanism, and how transhumanism openly calls for one world government, and says that the elite are going to exterminate the vast majority of us.
[00:57:18.203 --> 00:57:19.364]  And some of them are against it.
[00:57:19.404 --> 00:57:23.448]  Bill Joyce says it's bad, and others say it's okay, and others say it's wonderful.
[00:57:23.988 --> 00:57:26.250]  And it's just, this is what the elite's talking about.
[00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:27.591]  This is what they discuss.
[00:57:27.871 --> 00:57:28.932]  This is what they're into.
[00:57:29.152 --> 00:57:30.494]  This is what's governing the world.
[00:57:30.694 --> 00:57:34.337]  This is the ideology that drives our entire society.
[00:57:37.128 --> 00:57:40.190]  And unfortunately, the average American doesn't even know what eugenics is.
[00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:43.632]  And then if they do, it's a limited idea of, isn't that what Hitler did?
[00:57:43.652 --> 00:57:46.334]  Or isn't eugenics, you know, the study of race?
[00:57:46.534 --> 00:57:46.934]  No, no, no, no.
[00:57:47.254 --> 00:57:50.556]  The public view of eugenics is to make the race better.
[00:57:51.257 --> 00:57:56.400]  And then they use fraudulent means to do that and make false claims about different subgroups of humanity.
[00:57:57.181 --> 00:57:59.382]  Different varieties of homo sapien sapien.
[00:58:00.443 --> 00:58:04.325]  Will eugenics states, we're going to dumb down everybody and exterminate people?
[00:58:05.467 --> 00:58:07.549]  And we want to make people dumb to serve us.
[00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:09.971]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:58:11.412 --> 00:58:13.033]  This is just unbelievable.
[00:58:13.914 --> 00:58:16.616]  IBM, Microsoft, all of them are fronts for this.
[00:58:17.337 --> 00:58:18.177]  They mean business.
[00:58:18.658 --> 00:58:21.580]  And they're going to make what Hitler did look like child's play.
[00:58:22.221 --> 00:58:23.181]  Look like a warm-up.
[00:58:23.201 --> 00:58:24.362]  Look like a dress rehearsal.
[00:58:26.124 --> 00:58:27.125]  This is it, folks.
[00:58:27.225 --> 00:58:28.045]  We're going in.
[00:58:28.366 --> 00:58:29.667]  We're going in full front.
[00:58:30.407 --> 00:58:33.370]  And I just wanted you to know out there what Endgame really is.
[00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:35.011]  Because we're all in it.
[00:58:35.811 --> 00:58:37.332]  And it's a game of life and death.
[00:58:37.972 --> 00:58:38.973]  You're on the board.
[00:58:41.234 --> 00:58:45.156]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.476 --> 00:58:46.297]  Or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.337 --> 00:58:46.637]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.653 --> 00:58:59.714]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.414 --> 00:59:01.515]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.175 --> 00:59:03.015]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.756 --> 00:59:04.656]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.317 --> 00:59:09.019]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.499 --> 00:59:13.581]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:31.853 --> 00:59:33.974]  Last hour I was talking about the endgame.
[00:59:34.994 --> 00:59:35.854]  The big issue.
[00:59:35.874 --> 00:59:48.538]  A psychopathic global elite in almost complete control, setting up a world government so no independent nations can rally against them, and so they can have a world army to literally wage war.
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:52.341]  Against independent free humanity.
[00:59:52.601 --> 00:59:57.343]  The elite are building a world army, a world government to wage war on you.
[00:59:57.883 --> 00:59:59.684]  They do not expect you to submit to them.
[00:59:59.704 --> 01:00:00.944]  They do not expect you to talk.
[01:00:00.984 --> 01:00:02.505]  They do not expect you to be their slaves.
[01:00:02.905 --> 01:00:04.446]  They expect you to die.
[01:00:07.667 --> 01:00:08.807]  And that's the facts.
[01:00:08.947 --> 01:00:11.388]  And I'm sorry that it is so unbelievable.
[01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:13.109]  But that's the documentation.
[01:00:13.809 --> 01:00:17.311]  And when I showed Endgame here Tuesday night, Cheryl Hall
[01:00:18.863 --> 01:00:21.905]  The early nice lady manages a construction company here in Austin.
[01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:26.149]  I just mentioned some of the things we didn't put in the film because of time constraints.
[01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:32.033]  And one of those was the tetanus shots to sterilize women.
[01:00:32.414 --> 01:00:34.676]  And what's added to them that was in the mainstream news in the mid-90s.
[01:00:36.002 --> 01:00:37.243]  And so she's going to be in studio.
[01:00:37.303 --> 01:00:39.705]  Another lady popped up, then another lady it happened to.
[01:00:40.246 --> 01:00:41.847]  And some of these people have been brought there by friends.
[01:00:41.867 --> 01:00:42.768]  They were freaked out.
[01:00:43.208 --> 01:00:43.949]  They were like, what?
[01:00:44.369 --> 01:00:45.250]  How did you know?
[01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:49.893]  How did you know I had this autoimmune response from the tetanus shot in women?
[01:00:50.414 --> 01:00:52.135]  And I'm like, no, no, that's the sign of the report.
[01:00:52.195 --> 01:00:53.456]  She's like, but how did you know that?
[01:00:53.977 --> 01:00:54.697]  These are other women.
[01:00:55.117 --> 01:00:57.900]  And I was like, well, because that's what it does.
[01:01:00.122 --> 01:01:04.325]  I mean, they're they're they're waging war against us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:06.226 --> 01:01:08.428]  They're waging war against us everywhere.
[01:01:10.449 --> 01:01:22.078]  And the sooner we start coming to grips with that, and I'll tell the police, I'll tell the military, you serve this New World Order, they still shoot you up with those shots, even though you're a lapdog.
[01:01:24.419 --> 01:01:32.125]  They still have your children shot up with it, they still give you aspartame and 9,000 foods, they still put thousands and thousands of toxins in your water.
[01:01:33.506 --> 01:01:34.487]  They're not your friends!
[01:01:35.902 --> 01:01:36.562]  I don't hate you.
[01:01:37.223 --> 01:01:37.803]  I get angry.
[01:01:38.043 --> 01:01:39.324]  I get threatened by your ignorance.
[01:01:42.605 --> 01:01:46.247]  Back when Bill Clinton was in power, I didn't get mad at people with Bill Clinton stickers on their cars.
[01:01:46.567 --> 01:01:47.387]  I knew they meant well.
[01:01:49.648 --> 01:01:50.488]  Just like George Bush.
[01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:52.209]  I don't even get mad at you.
[01:01:52.229 --> 01:01:53.050]  I know you mean well.
[01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:54.790]  You'd be a nice person to go to a barbecue with.
[01:01:54.830 --> 01:01:55.891]  Good conservative.
[01:01:56.311 --> 01:01:57.932]  Think you're pro-Second Amendment.
[01:01:58.332 --> 01:01:59.913]  Think the war's pro-America.
[01:02:00.073 --> 01:02:01.393]  But you'd better wake up.
[01:02:01.973 --> 01:02:02.694]  You've been conned.
[01:02:02.714 --> 01:02:03.894]  You've been taken for a ride.
[01:02:04.475 --> 01:02:05.435]  You've been bamboozled.
[01:02:08.976 --> 01:02:13.557]  Look, you're not going to have to wait that long to see the things we've talked about come true if you don't listen to us real close.
[01:02:15.878 --> 01:02:19.059]  Later, we got Richard Reeves, who is a local reporter here in Austin.
[01:02:19.139 --> 01:02:20.899]  He was at the Straw Poll last weekend.
[01:02:20.939 --> 01:02:22.700]  I heard a bunch of other people, but I didn't know them.
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:23.460]  I couldn't confirm it.
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:26.721]  But he said it was a huge military psyop brainwashing fest.
[01:02:27.361 --> 01:02:29.962]  And Richard usually plays things down.
[01:02:30.002 --> 01:02:31.002]  He was saying it was bad.
[01:02:31.362 --> 01:02:32.862]  So he's going to be joining us from New York.
[01:02:32.883 --> 01:02:34.523]  He's already flown to New York to cover things there.
[01:02:35.083 --> 01:02:37.384]  He's in Austinite, coming up in about 20-30 minutes.
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:40.141]  Let me get Luke Radowsky popping in.
[01:02:41.741 --> 01:02:45.203]  Earlier in the last hour I got into the new incredible fake Bin Laden tape.
[01:02:45.223 --> 01:02:46.824]  You can look at it and tell it's a cartoon.
[01:02:47.224 --> 01:02:58.929]  But then we have the incredible development that the Pentagon admits that they have in the past released fake videos of al-Zaqqari.
[01:03:02.350 --> 01:03:08.193]  It's a quote from the Pentagon saying, quote, a propaganda campaign to magnify the role of the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:14.330]  Musab al-Zaqqari, which was target of the U.S.
[01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:23.533]  home audience, and that the discovery of the program was followed by the release of a videotape featuring, you guessed it, al-Zaqqari.
[01:03:25.353 --> 01:03:39.217]  Then they released a made-for-TV computer generation of Muhammad Atta, not real, a dramatization of him at an al-Qaeda camp, and then two years later, they release it saying it's real!
[01:03:40.839 --> 01:03:42.083]  But then admitting later it's fake.
[01:03:42.865 --> 01:03:44.710]  They treat you like you're a complete idiot.
[01:03:45.512 --> 01:03:46.134]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:53.266 --> 01:03:58.210]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:03.974]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:04:04.014 --> 01:04:08.297]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[01:04:08.638 --> 01:04:11.660]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:15.403]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[01:04:15.723 --> 01:04:25.069]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:04:25.329 --> 01:04:28.831]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:04:53.066 --> 01:05:01.011]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:01.371 --> 01:05:08.996]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:09.696 --> 01:05:16.759]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.159 --> 01:05:28.544]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:28.884 --> 01:05:32.426]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:32.826 --> 01:05:34.807]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.107 --> 01:05:38.889]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:06:21.027 --> 01:06:25.189]  You can give yourself the gift of health by calling for a bottle of Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea.
[01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:28.451]  The only thing better than chocolate is healthy chocolate.
[01:06:28.932 --> 01:06:32.434]  Here's how you can get a bottle of delicious Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea.
[01:06:33.371 --> 01:06:39.334]  For your risk-free bottle of Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea, call 1-800-894-3596.
[01:06:39.615 --> 01:06:44.057]  And if you call now, you can find out how to get a free bottle of Cocoa Pure with your order.
[01:06:44.197 --> 01:06:44.457]  Call 1-800-894-3596.
[01:06:44.477 --> 01:06:44.737]  That's 1-800-894-3596.
[01:06:44.757 --> 01:06:46.738]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:23.618 --> 01:07:33.821]  I premiered Endgame in Austin at the Alamo Draft House on South Lamar this last Tuesday, and I was going through, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:07:34.776 --> 01:07:41.938]  Some of the things that we had to cut out of the film, because it was over 3 hours long, and now it's 2 hours and 20 minutes, really still too long, but people say it's fast-moving.
[01:07:43.799 --> 01:07:48.580]  There's so much proof that we're not overstating what you see in the film, we're actually understating it.
[01:07:49.061 --> 01:07:56.523]  And I remember in the mid-1990s, it was in major African papers, major British papers, major French and Indian papers in India.
[01:07:57.370 --> 01:07:57.950]  That the U.N.
[01:07:57.990 --> 01:08:11.417]  had been caught in a program only for women, because it wouldn't have hurt men, adding a very expensive female hormone, synthetic, to tetanus, because when you bind something to tetanus, the body has an autoimmune response to whatever it was bound to.
[01:08:12.398 --> 01:08:17.621]  And that it was basically sterilizing women all over the world, and they'd been caught doing this.
[01:08:17.941 --> 01:08:20.122]  And it really freaked people out.
[01:08:20.831 --> 01:08:28.800]  And then later when we were taking questions, Cheryl Hall, a local Austinite, told her story about how she got really sick from it, really ill from it.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:30.762]  And then afterwards, two other women came up.
[01:08:31.743 --> 01:08:37.690]  These are nice, middle class, middle-aged ladies saying that years ago they'd taken the tetanus and that that had happened to them.
[01:08:38.487 --> 01:08:42.788]  And then there were people freaking out and some of the waitresses were going, oh my God, I just took it.
[01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:50.491]  And then a father came over and talked about how his 18-month-old baby, he gave it the third round of shots like he'd heard, and then it had seizures and was autistic.
[01:08:51.751 --> 01:09:03.315]  And then somebody I'd seen on television, high-level Governor Rick Perry's campaign, walks over and says, I'm with Rick Perry's campaign, and I learned about you a few years ago, but I was here to see what was in the film, and he calls me aside.
[01:09:04.412 --> 01:09:25.566]  He gave me his card, I think I gave it to Aaron, and he said that before I joined the Governor's team, back when he was in the legislature, he said I was a medic at Fort San Houston down in San Antonio, and they sent six guys in from Fort Sill, and they said give them these meningitis shots that came with them.
[01:09:25.586 --> 01:09:28.168]  And we gave them the shots, and in two days they all died horrible deaths.
[01:09:28.726 --> 01:09:32.189]  Then they told us scrub everything and basically we got the word it was a bioweapons test.
[01:09:32.529 --> 01:09:40.656]  Well I've just shown in the film all these documents where they march our troops in, nerve gas them, march them in, shoot them up, women go into hospitals, hit them with plutonium shots, kill them.
[01:09:41.136 --> 01:09:43.058]  I mean this is just thousands and it's admitted!
[01:09:43.658 --> 01:09:50.864]  And then I'm in a room with 250 people and they're all over the place from the governor's office coming up and women coming up and all of this is going on.
[01:09:51.945 --> 01:09:53.826]  And so I wanted to get Cheryl in studio.
[01:09:53.846 --> 01:09:54.747]  Cheryl, thank you for coming in.
[01:09:54.767 --> 01:09:55.728]  Thank you for having me.
[01:09:57.235 --> 01:10:07.843]  Just to break down just in a nutshell who you are, how old you were when this happened, and then now you've got a bunch of folders and documentation there, basically what you researched on your own and discovered.
[01:10:08.784 --> 01:10:10.605]  Okay, I was 36 at the time.
[01:10:10.685 --> 01:10:12.106]  I'm 40 now.
[01:10:12.126 --> 01:10:14.148]  It was December of 2003.
[01:10:15.069 --> 01:10:21.574]  I worked at a vet clinic at the time and I had cut myself between my fingers and fractured my hand at the same time.
[01:10:21.594 --> 01:10:22.635]  I went into the ER.
[01:10:22.655 --> 01:10:24.596]  While in the ER,
[01:10:26.397 --> 01:10:27.818]  They told me that I needed a tetanus shot.
[01:10:28.018 --> 01:10:28.538]  It was at St.
[01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:31.180]  David's Northwest, Austin, off of Mopac.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:35.302]  And I told them, I said, if you look in your records, I've already had a tetanus shot five years ago here.
[01:10:35.803 --> 01:10:36.923]  And they said, well, what was it for?
[01:10:36.963 --> 01:10:40.245]  And I explained it to them, and they said, well, it's a different kind of cut, so you need another one.
[01:10:40.826 --> 01:10:41.606]  I refused to stop.
[01:10:41.626 --> 01:10:43.667]  Which, by the way, my dad's a dentist, so I grew up around this.
[01:10:43.767 --> 01:10:46.429]  Used to, they said it lasted 12, then 10, now they say 7.
[01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:47.970]  That is a total lie.
[01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:49.591]  The same tetanus is the same tetanus.
[01:10:49.631 --> 01:10:49.891]  Go ahead.
[01:10:50.945 --> 01:10:55.488]  Anyways, um, so I refused, I refused to sign for the shot.
[01:10:55.648 --> 01:10:57.670]  By the way, I cut my finger almost completely off.
[01:10:57.690 --> 01:10:58.650]  They tried to make me take one.
[01:10:58.710 --> 01:11:00.372]  I just said no, but go ahead.
[01:11:00.592 --> 01:11:00.812]  I know.
[01:11:00.852 --> 01:11:04.274]  Well, I, that's what I kept saying to her and she was arguing with me and fighting with me.
[01:11:05.215 --> 01:11:10.759]  It was on my right hand that they were doing the x-rays and they were going to have to, you know, put a cast on.
[01:11:11.483 --> 01:11:12.644]  Because of the fracture.
[01:11:13.165 --> 01:11:14.967]  And I said, you know, I don't want this.
[01:11:15.047 --> 01:11:16.248]  And she goes, oh no, it's mandatory.
[01:11:16.268 --> 01:11:17.509]  You absolutely have to have it.
[01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:20.312]  Now, my husband at the time was sitting there and he says, she doesn't want it.
[01:11:20.372 --> 01:11:21.713]  She's already had one five years ago.
[01:11:21.814 --> 01:11:22.995]  Why are you doing this to us?
[01:11:23.355 --> 01:11:24.556]  By the way, it's not mandatory.
[01:11:24.817 --> 01:11:26.298]  Well, the x-ray machine was coming in.
[01:11:26.338 --> 01:11:28.260]  I was watching them bring the x-ray machine in.
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:32.124]  As I turned my head, she grabbed my arm and stuck me with the shot.
[01:11:32.284 --> 01:11:33.645]  My God, it gets worse.
[01:11:33.746 --> 01:11:33.906]  Okay.
[01:11:34.406 --> 01:11:35.807]  Oh, it gets even worse than that.
[01:11:35.867 --> 01:11:37.308]  I've had them try to inject my children.
[01:11:37.328 --> 01:11:38.489]  You have to watch them every second.
[01:11:38.949 --> 01:11:45.254]  Well, come to find out she didn't do it in the muscle where it was supposed to be done because of her abruptness and it went into my central nervous system.
[01:11:46.394 --> 01:11:53.479]  And with that, of course, I had the regular reactions where everything swells up, fever and whatnot for the first seven days.
[01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:56.822]  Well, after that, I started having severe seizures and convulsions.
[01:11:57.402 --> 01:11:58.783]  I was admitted into the hospital.
[01:11:58.803 --> 01:12:02.886]  I was in the hospital for four weeks at that point.
[01:12:03.812 --> 01:12:08.858]  And they OD'd me while I was in the hospital and I went into cardiac arrest and ended up in ICU.
[01:12:09.218 --> 01:12:10.419]  And they did this in front of my daughter.
[01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:20.971]  After that, I was released, paralyzed on my right side, blind in my right eye, halfway blind in my left, no feeling in my face, no feeling down the right side of my body.
[01:12:20.991 --> 01:12:22.673]  What did they say to you when you said it was the shot?
[01:12:22.693 --> 01:12:24.575]  That you were a conspiracy theorist?
[01:12:25.282 --> 01:12:25.642]  Well, no.
[01:12:25.662 --> 01:12:28.565]  What they said was that there's no possible way that it was the tetanus shot.
[01:12:28.605 --> 01:12:30.026]  It's all in your head, number one.
[01:12:30.366 --> 01:12:33.488]  Then I went through, you know, numerous... Of course, they're liable for malpractice.
[01:12:33.508 --> 01:12:34.429]  They're always going to say that.
[01:12:34.609 --> 01:12:38.412]  And the crazy thing is, all my paperwork was lost from the ER visit.
[01:12:38.432 --> 01:12:39.353]  They couldn't find it.
[01:12:39.433 --> 01:12:41.894]  The nurse was no longer at the hospital that did it to me.
[01:12:41.914 --> 01:12:43.075]  They lie and say that to you.
[01:12:43.416 --> 01:12:54.664]  But I did actually get a doctor in the ER when I was admitted, when I was having the seizures and convulsions, and she actually filled out an adverse report.
[01:12:55.353 --> 01:12:58.736]  For me to put in with the vaccination company.
[01:12:59.156 --> 01:12:59.856]  Adverse Reaction Report.
[01:12:59.916 --> 01:13:01.137]  Adverse Reaction Report.
[01:13:01.538 --> 01:13:02.178]  She signed it.
[01:13:02.278 --> 01:13:04.660]  She went through my symptoms and everything.
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.581]  They rejected it.
[01:13:06.862 --> 01:13:08.263]  They sent it back to me with a rejection.
[01:13:08.323 --> 01:13:14.267]  And that's why they say that about one in a hundred actual adverse reactions gets reported because they try to block those.
[01:13:14.307 --> 01:13:14.687]  Well they did.
[01:13:14.727 --> 01:13:15.528]  That's exactly what they did.
[01:13:15.548 --> 01:13:16.369]  We got all the paperwork in.
[01:13:16.409 --> 01:13:18.850]  We got letters from the company saying there's no possible way.
[01:13:19.131 --> 01:13:23.734]  Well then I started getting... Isn't it funny though that I mentioned tetanus and then all these women were freaking out in the audience.
[01:13:23.914 --> 01:13:24.995]  Yeah, it is amazing.
[01:13:25.175 --> 01:13:26.736]  It just so happens to hurt women, by the way.
[01:13:26.756 --> 01:13:27.756]  We're not seeing this with men.
[01:13:28.036 --> 01:13:28.677]  No, it's not.
[01:13:28.697 --> 01:13:31.358]  As a matter of fact, I started researching it on the internet.
[01:13:31.678 --> 01:13:35.200]  I finally got my eyesight back and a little bit of mobility in my right hand.
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.581]  So, I was home from work.
[01:13:36.601 --> 01:13:37.161]  I couldn't work.
[01:13:37.721 --> 01:13:39.082]  I was basically paralyzed.
[01:13:39.122 --> 01:13:40.123]  I had leg braces on.
[01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:42.984]  So, I sat in front of my computer and I did research on my own.
[01:13:43.404 --> 01:13:52.089]  Come to find out, this thing that never happens to people with tetanus, I was contacting almost 15,000 people worldwide that had the same exact
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:53.680]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:14:18.467 --> 01:14:20.828]  I had a seizure that was so severe it paralyzed my stomach.
[01:14:21.288 --> 01:14:26.210]  I was on a feeding tube for five weeks and they basically sent me home to die with a feeding tube.
[01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:28.451]  They released me from the hospital.
[01:14:28.471 --> 01:14:32.312]  They said you can go with a feeding tube or you can go without, but you're going home to die.
[01:14:33.493 --> 01:14:34.533]  And I was determined to live.
[01:14:34.573 --> 01:14:37.514]  I was determined to fight it because I knew it was very hard.
[01:14:37.614 --> 01:14:38.755]  Well, you look healthy now.
[01:14:38.775 --> 01:14:39.495]  Well, I'm doing good.
[01:14:39.535 --> 01:14:44.357]  I mean, my last seizure that I had was a year ago, Easter Sunday.
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:47.202]  And you've never thought about filing suit against them for that?
[01:14:47.342 --> 01:14:47.482]  I did.
[01:14:47.662 --> 01:14:49.904]  I hired six different lawyers, six different times.
[01:14:49.924 --> 01:14:52.306]  You know, once you sign up with one lawyer, they have to take your case.
[01:14:52.326 --> 01:14:54.568]  You can't go to a different lawyer and say, will you look into this for me?
[01:14:54.988 --> 01:14:57.510]  So they would hold my case for two to three months at a time.
[01:14:57.530 --> 01:15:04.616]  And they'd take the retainer, and then you know... They'd take the retainer, and then they'd hand all my paperwork back, and all my stuff, and this is the exact words out of their mouth.
[01:15:05.017 --> 01:15:07.619]  We can't fight this, because we'd be fighting the government.
[01:15:08.522 --> 01:15:10.363]  Exact words out of every one of them.
[01:15:10.403 --> 01:15:14.644]  And of course then you learned about the Vaccine Damage Fund and how secretive it is and how there's millions of people.
[01:15:14.704 --> 01:15:15.824]  Oh, millions of people.
[01:15:16.004 --> 01:15:20.666]  And there's very few... We've had babies die on our street after they get their shots.
[01:15:20.706 --> 01:15:27.248]  We have neighbors dying and it's just death everywhere and the injections continue and the media and there's billboards how good the shots are.
[01:15:27.268 --> 01:15:31.209]  Just the autism alone that is coming out of our children.
[01:15:32.029 --> 01:15:32.610]  Vaccinations.
[01:15:32.690 --> 01:15:33.410]  It's proven.
[01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:35.972]  They were never here 20 years ago.
[01:15:35.992 --> 01:15:41.115]  It's gone from 1 in 25,000 20 plus years ago to now, a few years ago it was 1 in 168.
[01:15:41.695 --> 01:15:42.616]  Now it's less than 1 in 76.
[01:15:42.656 --> 01:15:45.898]  And then they said it's over diagnosis.
[01:15:45.938 --> 01:15:52.022]  Now I go to see Ratatouille with my children and there's a whole front row of autistic children and autistic children in the back.
[01:15:52.082 --> 01:15:53.763]  I mean soon it will all be autistic.
[01:15:53.863 --> 01:15:54.663]  Exactly.
[01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:56.724]  Yeah, it's just crazy how they're doing that.
[01:15:56.744 --> 01:15:58.205]  They just keep saying everything's fine.
[01:15:58.245 --> 01:15:59.026]  Just keep injecting.
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:01.140]  Just tell her everything's wonderful.
[01:16:01.401 --> 01:16:01.941]  Absolutely.
[01:16:02.121 --> 01:16:07.143]  Also, I wanted to tell you, I got in touch with National Vaccination Reaction.
[01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:09.704]  She had emailed me.
[01:16:09.724 --> 01:16:12.946]  I left message with her numerous times.
[01:16:13.553 --> 01:16:14.834]  Giving a little piece of my story.
[01:16:15.194 --> 01:16:16.895]  I left messages numerous times.
[01:16:17.315 --> 01:16:18.216]  Never got back with me.
[01:16:18.516 --> 01:16:19.497]  Now, what is that group?
[01:16:19.777 --> 01:16:21.878]  This is the National Vaccination Reaction.
[01:16:22.178 --> 01:16:22.859]  Sure.
[01:16:22.979 --> 01:16:25.120]  So the national level where they're supposed to take the reports?
[01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:26.100]  Right, exactly.
[01:16:26.341 --> 01:16:33.025]  And, you know, like I said, I had hired lawyers all the way through the two-year, because you have a two-year cap in Texas, for them to fight it.
[01:16:33.305 --> 01:16:35.286]  The last lawyer that took my case was out of California.
[01:16:35.979 --> 01:16:39.922]  And he was an up-and-coming lawyer, so he figured, oh, I'll go ahead and take this case and we'll work on it.
[01:16:40.222 --> 01:16:46.186]  He had my case for almost six months, I'm wanting to say, and he came back saying, well, we could do it.
[01:16:46.346 --> 01:16:47.667]  We would be fighting the government.
[01:16:48.653 --> 01:16:56.679]  But what your bills accumulated to and what we'd be fighting for and what we would get out of it, it wouldn't be worth my time because it would be a 15 year process.
[01:16:56.759 --> 01:17:01.422]  90% of lawyers just collect and then talk you down and then get you to do a plea bargain if it's criminal.
[01:17:01.782 --> 01:17:03.743]  And if it's a civil matter, you're trying to defend yourself.
[01:17:03.783 --> 01:17:04.924]  They don't litigate.
[01:17:05.184 --> 01:17:09.467]  You have to actually, usually it has to be a family friend, and you have to have people who like to fight.
[01:17:10.148 --> 01:17:11.609]  And there's not many litigators out there.
[01:17:12.269 --> 01:17:12.690]  Right.
[01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:16.192]  It was very disheartening because... And then real litigators can only take a few cases a year.
[01:17:16.633 --> 01:17:17.073]  Exactly.
[01:17:17.313 --> 01:17:20.095]  Because, you know, all their time is on that.
[01:17:20.676 --> 01:17:22.677]  So, yeah, I was nothing to them.
[01:17:22.737 --> 01:17:25.640]  And if they had to fight the government for it, they didn't want to have anything to do with it.
[01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:27.982]  My bills accumulated to be over a million dollars.
[01:17:28.282 --> 01:17:29.743]  Now, unbelievable.
[01:17:29.823 --> 01:17:29.883]  Wow.
[01:17:30.083 --> 01:17:30.664]  In nine months.
[01:17:30.964 --> 01:17:34.547]  With the testing and the therapy and everything that I went through.
[01:17:34.887 --> 01:17:35.688]  Oh, it's incredible.
[01:17:35.708 --> 01:17:38.790]  I mean, you go get fingers stitched up and it's thousands of dollars.
[01:17:39.330 --> 01:17:40.111]  I broke my finger last week.
[01:17:41.132 --> 01:17:48.997]  Last year, $3,700 at the ER because I don't have, oh that's another thing, insurance companies will not cover me now because of what I went through.
[01:17:49.678 --> 01:17:55.482]  I could be covered for about $1,000 a month and that's what my bills come back as, to be covered.
[01:17:55.602 --> 01:18:02.047]  Well the tetanus injection keeps popping up, so do the hepatitis shots, so do the MMRs, measles, mumps, rubella.
[01:18:02.908 --> 01:18:09.773]  And there's no doubt, seeing Endgame, did you learn anything from Endgame, or did that change your view of how the stuff's going, how it's operating?
[01:18:09.793 --> 01:18:10.573]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:18:10.614 --> 01:18:12.475]  I mean, I knew a little bit about you.
[01:18:12.615 --> 01:18:17.458]  My fiancé is a big fan of yours, and he's introduced me to your Infant Wars site and that kind of thing.
[01:18:17.879 --> 01:18:21.101]  And, you know, I have it on my favorites, and I look it up, and I listen to you at work and stuff.
[01:18:21.761 --> 01:18:31.128]  But what amazes me, well, Build-A-Burger, the whole group, and who is behind all of this, and what they are trying to do to us,
[01:18:32.409 --> 01:18:37.373]  People need to wake up and realize that our government's not for us.
[01:18:38.274 --> 01:18:38.794]  Not anymore.
[01:18:39.235 --> 01:18:44.018]  What happened to our Founding Fathers is... I went to Washington last year to tour Washington D.C.
[01:18:44.238 --> 01:18:50.003]  and what I read from statements of our Founding Fathers, they'd be rolling over in their graves right now.
[01:18:50.023 --> 01:18:50.803]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:50.823 --> 01:18:51.244]  Stay with us.

[01:19:45.205 --> 01:19:48.948]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:19:49.549 --> 01:19:51.030]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:52.471 --> 01:19:54.753]  This is a market alert from Midas Resources.
[01:19:55.133 --> 01:20:05.122]  Since August 9th, the Fed has created and injected $200 billion into the financial markets to keep them afloat, ignoring the hyperinflationary hangover that is the sure result.
[01:20:05.602 --> 01:20:11.146]  Data released by the New York Federal Reserve shows that foreign central banks have cut their stash of U.S.
[01:20:11.187 --> 01:20:12.608]  Treasuries by $48 billion since late July.
[01:20:14.821 --> 01:20:17.863]  With falls of 32 billion in the last two weeks alone.
[01:20:18.363 --> 01:20:20.404]  Could China be quietly dumping the dollar?
[01:20:21.325 --> 01:20:24.287]  The quality of your life depends on the quality of your currency.
[01:20:24.527 --> 01:20:26.488]  And the quality of the dollar is poor.
[01:20:26.688 --> 01:20:28.449]  Because the quantity is so high.
[01:20:28.810 --> 01:20:31.631]  Printing money out of thin air has disastrous results.
[01:20:31.791 --> 01:20:34.593]  Victimizing middle class citizens and discouraging savings.
[01:20:35.153 --> 01:20:39.656]  If you have been considering precious metals as a hedge against inflation, you need to act now.
[01:20:40.076 --> 01:20:42.618]  Procrastination is the mother of lost opportunities.
[01:20:43.078 --> 01:20:44.699]  Call me, Tom Andrew at 1-800-606-1294.
[01:20:44.779 --> 01:20:44.999]  That's 1-800-606-1294.
[01:20:52.766 --> 01:20:54.628]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:20:54.748 --> 01:20:59.952]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:21:00.112 --> 01:21:01.453]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:21:01.733 --> 01:21:09.899]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:15.844]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:21:16.004 --> 01:21:17.785]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:21:17.865 --> 01:21:20.005]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:21:20.145 --> 01:21:24.387]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:21:24.567 --> 01:21:26.727]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:21:26.807 --> 01:21:34.550]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:21:34.670 --> 01:21:34.970]  We're good.
[01:21:52.837 --> 01:21:54.778]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach!
[01:21:55.218 --> 01:21:55.478]  Look!
[01:21:55.899 --> 01:21:56.959]  Up there in the sky!
[01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:58.660]  It's Non-X-Man!
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.241]  He's in a dive!
[01:22:00.521 --> 01:22:02.522]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach!
[01:22:02.822 --> 01:22:03.603]  Let's go look!
[01:22:05.824 --> 01:22:09.006]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel!
[01:22:09.426 --> 01:22:10.767]  Stop hiding them in the sand!
[01:22:10.967 --> 01:22:11.387]  Take them out!
[01:22:12.023 --> 01:22:12.723]  Let's see.
[01:22:12.743 --> 01:22:17.245]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[01:22:17.646 --> 01:22:18.126]  Don't worry.
[01:22:18.586 --> 01:22:20.107]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:22:20.727 --> 01:22:25.149]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:27.730]  Oh, I will, Non-X Man.
[01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:30.611]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[01:22:32.712 --> 01:22:35.354]  Don't let Non-X Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[01:22:35.814 --> 01:22:39.295]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:22:39.816 --> 01:22:40.756]  It's in the foot care aisle
[01:22:44.596 --> 01:23:03.985]  I don't want to just glaze over this, folks.
[01:23:05.225 --> 01:23:11.168]  One of Rick Perry's chief people, I'll just leave it at that, because I didn't make, I didn't get it clear if he wanted to talk about it on air.
[01:23:12.296 --> 01:23:13.476]  I've seen on television.
[01:23:15.217 --> 01:23:16.057]  Walked up to me.
[01:23:16.077 --> 01:23:19.358]  He was there with four members of Rick Perry's staff with him.
[01:23:20.179 --> 01:23:22.439]  He said, I want you to know I really appreciate what you're doing.
[01:23:22.459 --> 01:23:27.161]  If you don't know who I am, you know, I met your wife, blah, blah, blah.
[01:23:29.482 --> 01:23:30.182]  I was a medic.
[01:23:30.222 --> 01:23:31.723]  They told us give these guys these shots.
[01:23:31.883 --> 01:23:33.363]  All six of them we gave died.
[01:23:33.563 --> 01:23:38.865]  They were sent there under orders to be given the shots and they died right in front of them.
[01:23:40.268 --> 01:23:41.110]  They know what they're doing.
[01:23:41.751 --> 01:23:51.168]  And, Cheryl, you were just talking about how it rotted a huge hole in your arm, but they're saying, oh no, it's not the shot, that's not the reason you went from being paralyzed to wheelchair to walker to crutches.
[01:23:52.077 --> 01:23:56.101]  And you were just telling me during the break that you got a divorce over all this.
[01:23:56.261 --> 01:24:01.706]  I don't want to say devastating as you've come back, thanks to the grace of God, but this is just amazing.
[01:24:02.267 --> 01:24:13.457]  Yeah, like I said, I went through so many different things from being blind, and I still don't have feeling in this part of my face on my right side, and there's a part of my right foot that I still don't have feeling in.
[01:24:14.258 --> 01:24:15.079]  You know, just that kind of thing.
[01:24:15.119 --> 01:24:16.980]  But I went to a dermatologist.
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:18.021]  They tested my arm.
[01:24:18.061 --> 01:24:19.322]  They would do skin grafts on it.
[01:24:19.742 --> 01:24:20.643]  And it was just oozing.
[01:24:20.663 --> 01:24:24.866]  I mean, for a year and a half after the shot, my arm would just be open and oozing.
[01:24:24.906 --> 01:24:26.247]  But your body was able to beat it.
[01:24:26.707 --> 01:24:29.289]  Well, what they were saying was my body was trying to reject it.
[01:24:29.349 --> 01:24:30.190]  And that's why it was oozing.
[01:24:30.230 --> 01:24:31.010]  It was pushing it out.
[01:24:31.351 --> 01:24:35.274]  But there was one point where when they looked at it, they said, we just need to take a chunk of your arm out.
[01:24:35.614 --> 01:24:36.354]  So this will stop.
[01:24:36.675 --> 01:24:38.816]  And I said, no, you're not taking a chunk of my arm out.
[01:24:38.856 --> 01:24:40.978]  I mean, I'm already paralyzed from all of this.
[01:24:41.518 --> 01:24:42.439]  You're not going to do that.
[01:24:43.152 --> 01:24:47.056]  Now, somewhere in there you got a report that it was an autoimmune response?
[01:24:48.078 --> 01:24:53.023]  From being in my central nervous system?
[01:24:53.504 --> 01:24:53.684]  Yes.
[01:24:54.845 --> 01:24:56.927]  Because that's what we've got in the reports.
[01:24:57.208 --> 01:24:59.270]  Now, I'm not trying to scare you further, but
[01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:08.758]  I mean, who knows if you're going to be able to have children now, because that, I mean, if it was that particular 9-11 attack and you just had a larger response, that's what the U.N.
[01:25:08.798 --> 01:25:09.318]  program is.
[01:25:09.578 --> 01:25:11.140]  I know they're carrying those out here as well.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:11.901]  Yeah.
[01:25:11.941 --> 01:25:15.644]  See, I don't know, because I had my teeth tied after I had my child, and she's 16 now.
[01:25:16.045 --> 01:25:20.309]  But what about the younger women that are having these shots?
[01:25:20.911 --> 01:25:24.412]  Well, what about the HPV shot that's a live virus?
[01:25:25.092 --> 01:25:27.333]  I was telling women that and they didn't believe me at the event.
[01:25:27.813 --> 01:25:31.934]  It's a live virus, ladies, and it's been killing a bunch of the girls that take it.
[01:25:32.314 --> 01:25:37.235]  And we've had them on where it's like they're bleeding out of every orifice, things are swelling up, they're getting paralyzed.
[01:25:37.735 --> 01:25:38.095]  Same thing.
[01:25:42.168 --> 01:25:46.531]  OB-GYN was pushing it on us to have her get it.
[01:25:47.152 --> 01:25:49.634]  And I didn't know anything about it when it first came out.
[01:25:50.134 --> 01:25:52.076]  So I gave her the, there's a three series.
[01:25:52.236 --> 01:25:54.317]  You get one and then you wait two months and you get another.
[01:25:54.578 --> 01:26:00.002]  So I went ahead and let her have that first one because I had cervical cancer when I was 20, 18 or 20, somewhere in there.
[01:26:00.502 --> 01:26:02.744]  Anyways, um, I started reading about it.
[01:26:04.025 --> 01:26:06.467]  You've already been paralyzed though, but you still are trusting the system or?
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.301]  Well, you know, it was one of those things where... I understand.
[01:26:09.321 --> 01:26:10.161]  You want to protect your daughter.
[01:26:10.461 --> 01:26:11.202]  The way they bill it.
[01:26:11.242 --> 01:26:13.582]  But, like, I haven't let her have a tetanus shot.
[01:26:13.622 --> 01:26:18.044]  As a matter of fact, I had to get waivers done for her to go to school.
[01:26:18.064 --> 01:26:18.864]  No, no.
[01:26:18.904 --> 01:26:19.865]  I'm not saying you're bad.
[01:26:19.905 --> 01:26:25.367]  I'm just saying because you're a nice person, you don't expect it to be... And again, the nurses pushing this, they believe in it, too.
[01:26:25.667 --> 01:26:28.448]  That's the beauty of the New World Order system, is it's compartmentalized.
[01:26:28.468 --> 01:26:31.589]  They put it in the vaccines, and then the doctors and nurses think it's good.
[01:26:31.969 --> 01:26:32.869]  Right, exactly.
[01:26:32.929 --> 01:26:40.473]  But after she had the first one, I also noticed mood swing changes and a bunch of different things that was going on with her that wasn't normal.
[01:26:41.073 --> 01:26:45.675]  And so when I started reading up on it, I was doing research on it, I decided that I'm not letting her have the series.
[01:26:46.175 --> 01:26:51.278]  Well, when we went back to the doctor's office, they're like, well, do you realize she's going to have to start this series all over again?
[01:26:51.298 --> 01:26:52.718]  I said, no, because we're not doing it.
[01:26:53.999 --> 01:26:57.120]  Well, thank God you didn't take the other two shots because it's in the same family.
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:00.622]  Have you heard about the shots that give you the, quote, cure you of cigarette smoking?
[01:27:01.650 --> 01:27:03.131]  Yeah, I've heard something about that.
[01:27:03.151 --> 01:27:21.897]  Okay, what they do is they go in with live viruses and actually attack the brain and actually kill the neuroreceptors and kill whole ganglia of nerve bundles and actually causes a virus-induced lobotomy to where you do not have the same endorphin uptake levels.
[01:27:22.532 --> 01:27:22.852]  Wow.
[01:27:23.192 --> 01:27:24.593]  No, I didn't hear it.
[01:27:24.633 --> 01:27:34.778]  See, it's the most blasphemous, massive evil you can imagine that actually attacks the brain, and the average people aren't even aware of it, and they're trying to make it mandatory in England and the U.S.
[01:27:35.699 --> 01:27:36.399]  That's crazy.
[01:27:36.579 --> 01:27:38.040]  That's absolutely nuts.
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:39.061]  But I'm not kidding.
[01:27:39.081 --> 01:27:40.361]  You can't make this type of stuff up.
[01:27:40.501 --> 01:27:43.503]  It is a virus that literally attacks the brain.
[01:27:45.362 --> 01:27:46.463]  I just don't get that.
[01:27:46.583 --> 01:27:55.330]  I mean, no, I understand what you're saying, but it's hard for me to fathom the government doing this stuff.
[01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.950]  It's hard for me.
[01:27:55.970 --> 01:28:06.678]  Did you see all the reports in Endgame about the admissions of spraying all of England repeatedly with deadly bioweapons, killing people on the New York subway, sterilizing 42% of Native American women?
[01:28:07.699 --> 01:28:09.160]  You know why they're doing that.
[01:28:10.573 --> 01:28:11.474]  Native American women.
[01:28:11.674 --> 01:28:13.075]  Because they're racist.
[01:28:13.115 --> 01:28:16.698]  Well, they don't want them to produce anymore because, you know, it was their country.
[01:28:17.078 --> 01:28:17.478]  Exactly.
[01:28:17.538 --> 01:28:23.162]  And they want their land, and if they have more offspring, then we're just constantly having to supply to them.
[01:28:23.703 --> 01:28:24.243]  The government.
[01:28:24.263 --> 01:28:25.204]  That's it.
[01:28:25.224 --> 01:28:26.024]  Kill them.
[01:28:26.585 --> 01:28:28.626]  But the government wouldn't hurt us on 9-11, though.
[01:28:28.726 --> 01:28:30.528]  They'd kill everybody else, but they're not going to hurt us.
[01:28:30.908 --> 01:28:31.448]  They care about us.
[01:28:31.729 --> 01:28:37.553]  We'll be right back on the other side, final segment with our guest, Richard Reeves from New York, with Ron Polnish.
[01:28:43.425 --> 01:28:46.433]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.356 --> 01:28:50.063]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.254 --> 01:28:57.538]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:28:57.778 --> 01:29:02.623]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:29:02.883 --> 01:29:04.224]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[01:32:09.983 --> 01:32:10.723]  We're here live.
[01:32:10.744 --> 01:32:20.011]  The GCN Radio Network retransmits us over the satellites, the internet, and we're on global shortwave and a lot of AM and FM's from 9 to midnight yet again.

[01:32:55.531 --> 01:33:00.535]  when you're at the graveyard shift there at the factory or on the military base.
[01:33:00.735 --> 01:33:02.337]  We have listeners in Antarctica,
[01:33:04.098 --> 01:33:05.598]  Down there at weather bases.
[01:33:05.618 --> 01:33:07.920]  I've been getting emails and letters for 10 years.
[01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:09.400]  We've got people listening in China.
[01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:16.384]  We've got people listening off satellites in Africa, in missionary bases, on shortwave satellite internet.
[01:33:16.464 --> 01:33:18.144]  It is just so great to have you tuned in.
[01:33:18.164 --> 01:33:19.085]  Let me tell you about a couple of sponsors.
[01:33:19.105 --> 01:33:25.228]  We're going to go back to our guest, and there's so much in her story, I wish I could have scheduled her for a full hour, but we've got stacked up guests here.
[01:33:26.148 --> 01:33:28.029]  There's the RonPaulDollar.net.
[01:33:28.089 --> 01:33:29.370]  RonPaulDollar.net.
[01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:31.731]  I remember seeing these a couple of months ago, these beautiful
[01:33:32.839 --> 01:33:38.668]  Gold, silver, and of course, bronze, Ron Paul, Liberty Dollars.
[01:33:39.406 --> 01:33:43.588]  You know, they look like the silver dollars or the gold dollars, and just absolutely beautiful.
[01:33:43.628 --> 01:33:47.969]  And I have now gotten one for myself, just as a collector's item, in gold of Ron Paul.
[01:33:47.989 --> 01:33:49.330]  They have them in different sizes, too.
[01:33:49.810 --> 01:33:57.433]  And it's ronpauldollar.net or 888libdollar, 888libdollar, and tell them Alex Jones sent you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:58.053 --> 01:34:07.817]  The Ron Paul dollar, the Liberty dollar, a private voluntary barter currency, but for me it's just a collector's item, and plus it has the numismatic value for the collector and also the precious metals.
[01:34:08.397 --> 01:34:10.799]  The Federal Reserve creates inflation when it issues U.S.
[01:34:10.819 --> 01:34:20.868]  dollars backed by government debt, and Ron Paul is an enemy of that system, so why not have a Liberty Dollar with his vistage stamped on it since 1913 when the Federal Reserve was created by Congress?
[01:34:21.649 --> 01:34:23.531]  Your money has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[01:34:25.623 --> 01:34:36.612]  We now have the Liberty Dollar, ladies and gentlemen, available for you at RonPaulDollar.net or 888-421-6181.
[01:34:37.052 --> 01:34:40.615]  You can also just call and they can answer your question, but be sure and go to the website and check it out.
[01:34:40.635 --> 01:34:42.076]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:42.377 --> 01:34:46.500]  We have a big fat banner right on the right-hand side if you missed that web address.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:52.545]  Going back to Cheryl Hall, who manages a little construction company here in town and came to see Endgame Tuesday night.
[01:34:53.641 --> 01:34:59.244]  Just recapping, there were two other women who said the same thing that happened to them.
[01:34:59.344 --> 01:35:06.949]  There were men there who got the third round of shots and their children had gone from blowing out the birthday cake candles at one to being in the corner autistic.
[01:35:08.130 --> 01:35:10.991]  There was a high-level guy from Governor Rick Perry's campaign.
[01:35:11.051 --> 01:35:11.331]  I know him.
[01:35:11.351 --> 01:35:13.693]  I've seen him on television saying, yeah, I was a medic ten years ago.
[01:35:14.798 --> 01:35:16.842]  We were told to give shots to six guys and they all died.
[01:35:17.403 --> 01:35:19.487]  Later it came out with some kind of bioweapons program.
[01:35:19.867 --> 01:35:21.190]  I mean, that's just, it's everywhere!
[01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:23.033]  In a group of 250, that was the stories right there!
[01:35:25.672 --> 01:35:29.673]  I mean, this is massive, but because they don't make it a big issue, it isn't a big issue.
[01:35:30.233 --> 01:35:36.835]  And just in closing, Cheryl, any other facets or areas we haven't covered in this, or any of the other, you've got big stacks of documents there.
[01:35:36.855 --> 01:35:42.896]  We were talking during the break about today, this happened to you a few years ago, but you were going back through your notes and you said it made you cry.
[01:35:42.916 --> 01:35:44.797]  I mean, go back over any points you haven't covered.
[01:35:45.277 --> 01:35:47.179]  Well, I mean, I was just getting my stuff together.
[01:35:47.199 --> 01:35:49.180]  I didn't know what kind of questions I was going to be asked today.
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:54.484]  So, dealing with going through the folders and the files and just the different things.
[01:35:55.124 --> 01:35:58.867]  And I wrote, I had to document everything for lawyers' purposes.
[01:35:59.147 --> 01:36:01.448]  I had to document every day everything that I went through.
[01:36:01.929 --> 01:36:08.273]  And I broke down reading some of the stuff that I had gone through because, you know, you put it behind you.
[01:36:08.293 --> 01:36:11.375]  You know that there's, you know, what can you do at this point?
[01:36:11.395 --> 01:36:12.376]  I mean, that was back in
[01:36:12.996 --> 01:36:36.716]  You know 2003 December of I've struggled with it for you know a good year and a half to get back on my feet and walk again and you put that kind of stuff behind you and when I started reading through my notes and what I went through on a daily basis of I had a bell by my bed and I had to ring the bell to have somebody come and help me this is when I was at home when I wasn't being hospitalized to have somebody come get me to go to the bathroom.
[01:36:36.896 --> 01:36:37.757]  It's very humiliating.
[01:36:38.317 --> 01:36:48.707]  It's, you know, it's one of those things where, I mean, and I remember times where I hurt so bad that I would have to soak in cold water in a tub for an hour just to relieve the pain.
[01:36:48.727 --> 01:36:50.168]  Your body was fighting for its life.
[01:36:50.429 --> 01:36:53.912]  It was, and now I have rheumatoid arthritis.
[01:36:54.472 --> 01:36:55.914]  That's associated with autoimmune responses.
[01:36:55.934 --> 01:36:58.316]  Right, it's in my lower spine and it's in my hands.
[01:36:59.383 --> 01:37:01.166]  There are alternative ways to get rid of that.
[01:37:01.587 --> 01:37:09.243]  Now, let me just, in closing here, walk through a few issues for people out there watching this on the web later or listening to the radio right now, because this is very important.
[01:37:13.015 --> 01:37:18.899]  I would like to think, okay, 50 years ago they gave the vaccine makers immunity.
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:22.862]  And people say, well wait a minute, I heard Bush gave them immunity a few years ago and that got reversed.
[01:37:22.902 --> 01:37:25.564]  No, he gave them total immunity out of the gates, period.
[01:37:26.145 --> 01:37:42.377]  The way it works now is, for the last 50 plus years, is, since the whole polio vaccine controversy, and I believe that was a bioweapon test, and I've got evidence to that, but the point is, that's another story, is that
[01:37:44.309 --> 01:37:46.471]  The vaccine makers never have to pay for liability.
[01:37:46.491 --> 01:38:01.882]  The federal government, if you can ever jump through all the hoops and spend millions of dollars in lawsuits, then you can go to a federal board who has, last time I checked it was more than two billion dollars, just sitting there and they hardly ever pay out, and then they'll give you a few million to shut up.
[01:38:02.503 --> 01:38:03.844]  And very few of those are paid out.
[01:38:03.904 --> 01:38:08.447]  So they basically have almost complete liability protection right now.
[01:38:08.567 --> 01:38:10.509]  And so all we can do to fight them is warn people.
[01:38:11.167 --> 01:38:16.754]  Now I want to be clear, I'm not saying in a perfect world that vaccines don't have uses and they couldn't be clean and couldn't help people.
[01:38:17.295 --> 01:38:20.079]  But that's a 300 year old controversy since they started in England.
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:23.662]  And a lot of top scientists then said, no, it was actually a bad idea.
[01:38:24.143 --> 01:38:25.984]  But people like Benjamin Franklin before it.
[01:38:26.264 --> 01:38:27.825]  I mean, you can debate it either way.
[01:38:27.905 --> 01:38:32.428]  I'm not saying that medicine and science couldn't be good, but when it's in the hands of eugenicists, it's not.
[01:38:32.849 --> 01:38:34.830]  So people can argue, well, maybe they're just screwing up.
[01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:36.151]  Maybe it's bad manufacturers.
[01:38:36.171 --> 01:38:41.635]  Maybe Cheryl is just the one out of a million example.
[01:38:42.293 --> 01:38:43.054]  Let me explain something.
[01:38:43.395 --> 01:38:49.563]  This isn't just where the government gives them liability protection so they put out shoddy vaccines and that's a recipe for disaster.
[01:38:49.783 --> 01:38:55.811]  If you've got an industry where for 50 plus years, well they've had vaccine protection for I think 54 years now.
[01:38:56.732 --> 01:38:58.614]  I know they've had them since the mid-50s.
[01:39:01.335 --> 01:39:12.612]  If they have total liability protection, that is a recipe to put out horrible, dangerous products that are bred in these tissues and animal tissues and fetal tissues and produced and are so dangerous.
[01:39:13.499 --> 01:39:24.347]  That right there is bad enough, but then when you add to it that we've got government documents, thousands of them, saying they're going to use vaccines to sterilize and kill and euthanize people, and then they've been caught doing it.
[01:39:24.687 --> 01:39:34.294]  And then you're in a movie theater of 250 people, and you've got people from the governor's office going, you know, we gave shots to people and they all died, and women are all over saying, I was paralyzed, I was paralyzed.
[01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:35.695]  I mean, this is big.
[01:39:36.456 --> 01:39:37.237]  This is big.
[01:39:37.277 --> 01:39:38.778]  That's just anecdotal right there.
[01:39:39.839 --> 01:39:41.660]  With that, Cheryl, comments to that
[01:39:42.293 --> 01:39:43.654]  I mean, the information I was just putting out?
[01:39:44.054 --> 01:39:49.558]  Well, like you said, you know, they'll give you a little bit of money to shut you up kind of thing and walk away.
[01:39:50.219 --> 01:39:54.402]  I wasn't quite that lucky, and when I say that, I mean, my bills were over a million dollars.
[01:39:55.703 --> 01:40:06.090]  My out-of-pocket was $379,000, which I fought against and ended up using my daughter's college fund of $27,000 to pay off my medical bills.
[01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:09.232]  And like I said, there's not an insurance company out there that'll take me now.
[01:40:09.532 --> 01:40:10.193]  I'm a high risk.
[01:40:11.101 --> 01:40:12.642]  So, you know, and it's not just me.
[01:40:13.142 --> 01:40:14.403]  Go on the internet.
[01:40:14.943 --> 01:40:18.685]  Research, not just tetanus, but vaccination reactions all together.
[01:40:19.085 --> 01:40:22.147]  It's amazing the stories that you will find and hear.
[01:40:22.167 --> 01:40:23.368]  And it's not just with children.
[01:40:23.868 --> 01:40:24.588]  It is with adults.
[01:40:25.169 --> 01:40:27.710]  It's, you know, it's amazing to me.
[01:40:28.090 --> 01:40:29.291]  Cheryl, I'm here to tell you.
[01:40:30.572 --> 01:40:40.437]  The Rockefellers in the 20s, and I've read the university studies from MIT, the top studies from UT, medical schools all over the country, biology departments.
[01:40:41.434 --> 01:40:46.948]  They learned that most cancers are virally transmitted, which most Americans still don't even know.
[01:40:47.893 --> 01:41:00.824]  And they learned and they literally bought up the market in the hospitals through foundations and they control the cancer market where a bag of pesticide that's worth a dollar, literal raid, is then sold for thousands of dollars in chemo.
[01:41:01.245 --> 01:41:05.588]  And they went out and they put in the vaccines, cancer viruses.
[01:41:06.049 --> 01:41:11.754]  And they've done it all over the world, thousands of different types of cancer viruses and it is a scourge now upon us.
[01:41:12.569 --> 01:41:30.160]  With cancer up several thousand percentage points on average depending on which cancer it is all over the world from what it was in the twenties when they launched that and we found the original research where they studied cancer viruses and how to make communicable viruses and we have CIA studies from the sixties where they did it again in seventies
[01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:37.667]  And they can walk up and just have a little plastic glove on their finger, just tap you on the shoulder, and you're going to die six months later of cancer.
[01:41:38.088 --> 01:41:40.270]  They have got such diabolical systems.
[01:41:40.650 --> 01:41:47.097]  But the main cancers they're putting in are these DNA fragments that lay dormant until there's been a certain number of cell divisions.
[01:41:47.377 --> 01:41:48.438]  Then they activate.
[01:41:48.778 --> 01:41:51.361]  It's literally like Logan's Run and Carousel.
[01:41:51.802 --> 01:41:53.964]  Once you get past that retired level,
[01:41:54.444 --> 01:41:56.448]  Then they get your whole life's retirement.
[01:41:56.949 --> 01:42:01.659]  You saved a million bucks and you die and they get that whole million bucks in that six months while they kill you.
[01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:04.504]  And you try to tell people this, they just can't believe it.
[01:42:04.545 --> 01:42:06.088]  And until we expose this,
[01:42:07.014 --> 01:42:09.195]  It's going to continue to happen, and it's the big issue.
[01:42:09.215 --> 01:42:10.495]  That's why I want to make another film.
[01:42:10.535 --> 01:42:18.617]  I'm going to have an in-game too, because as much as this isn't an in-game, we didn't show one one-hundredth of the evidence we've got, and it had a lot of information.
[01:42:18.657 --> 01:42:19.617]  Can I add something real quick?
[01:42:19.637 --> 01:42:20.078]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:42:20.198 --> 01:42:23.859]  It's not just in our vaccinations and that kind of thing either.
[01:42:24.099 --> 01:42:24.939]  It's in our foods.
[01:42:25.359 --> 01:42:32.761]  If you research the FDA and how they are approving what we're eating and what we're putting in our bodies,
[01:42:34.241 --> 01:42:40.548]  It just floors me to see not just cancer, but hormonal type situations.
[01:42:40.568 --> 01:42:41.650]  The plastics we drink out of.
[01:42:41.930 --> 01:42:42.370]  Exactly.
[01:42:42.811 --> 01:42:46.435]  It makes our women hyper feminine and it makes our men feminine.
[01:42:46.856 --> 01:42:48.698]  It's by design, they even brag about that.
[01:42:48.718 --> 01:42:51.621]  It's the type of plastics they use by design, leach.
[01:42:51.981 --> 01:42:54.825]  And it's all around us to where we just can't, it's like we can't stop.
[01:42:55.185 --> 01:42:55.365]  Right.
[01:42:55.885 --> 01:42:56.165]  Exactly.
[01:42:56.185 --> 01:43:05.768]  As a matter of fact, there was something that I read just the other day, and this has nothing to do with vaccinations and I'm sorry, but they were talking about how they are not going to be actually selling whole nuts anymore.
[01:43:06.328 --> 01:43:09.509]  Even if the label says whole nuts, they're still going to be pasteurized.
[01:43:10.669 --> 01:43:12.610]  So you won't be able to get raw food.
[01:43:12.630 --> 01:43:14.250]  It won't be available.
[01:43:14.330 --> 01:43:15.530]  Everything's got to be radiated.
[01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:16.831]  Everything's got to be through their hands.
[01:43:16.891 --> 01:43:18.071]  Everything's got to be controlled.
[01:43:19.562 --> 01:43:22.783]  And just in closing, I've had Nobel Prize winners on the show.
[01:43:22.803 --> 01:43:31.926]  I mean, I've had top scientists who were making millions and millions a year, top research scientists, you know, living in the big house on the hill, and they would, and they believed in eugenic engineering.
[01:43:31.946 --> 01:43:33.986]  This was 20 years ago with one of the famous guys out of England.
[01:43:34.006 --> 01:43:36.507]  I'm going to interview him again because now he's been proven right.
[01:43:37.501 --> 01:43:44.190]  And he found that half the rats were dying just after a few weeks being given this particular potato that had been engineered.
[01:43:44.210 --> 01:43:45.371]  It had one gene change.
[01:43:45.412 --> 01:43:50.678]  But he said you could change that one trait and it would randomly change thousands each time, each generation of the potato.
[01:43:51.099 --> 01:43:55.665]  And he said it was creating new amino acids and new carcinogens that had never existed in the life chain.
[01:43:56.371 --> 01:43:57.552]  And he said, we can't approve this.
[01:43:57.572 --> 01:43:58.633]  And they said, shut up.
[01:43:58.913 --> 01:43:59.593]  We're going to do this.
[01:43:59.613 --> 01:44:02.316]  And then he basically got run out of there.
[01:44:02.336 --> 01:44:03.136]  And then he spoke out.
[01:44:03.356 --> 01:44:04.577]  But it's all these other scientists.
[01:44:04.617 --> 01:44:05.838]  And now most foods have it.
[01:44:06.038 --> 01:44:09.381]  That's what I mean, folks, the level of the crises.
[01:44:10.274 --> 01:44:10.874]  That's right.
[01:44:31.884 --> 01:44:41.526]  I might want to get you back in studio sometime, or we're about to start the new season on the TV show, maybe have you on the television show in a better setting, because you can show your documents and go over it.
[01:44:42.086 --> 01:44:49.548]  But thank you for coming on the air, because I think doing this, you're going to save, probably just from this interview alone, tens of thousands of people aren't going to vaccinate.
[01:44:49.588 --> 01:44:55.889]  Now, the BBC admitted a few years ago, we almost put this in in-game but didn't have time to, that they've admitted
[01:44:56.738 --> 01:45:03.684]  That in Pakistan and several other areas they were refusing to take polio shots because the imams were saying it's feralizing, because they were noticing women that took it couldn't have babies.
[01:45:04.864 --> 01:45:11.009]  And of course then it came out in the news, and so then there was the first ever, you know, after decades, release of polio.
[01:45:11.370 --> 01:45:12.771]  And it was all over the place suddenly.
[01:45:13.571 --> 01:45:19.356]  And so don't think they're not going to hit us with bioweapons because we won't take the shots, and then say, see, you wouldn't take the shot.
[01:45:20.417 --> 01:45:22.058]  I mean, they're diabolical folks.
[01:45:22.651 --> 01:45:36.022]  Well, another thing, I know you've got things going on, but another thing they're doing is giving that live virus so it shows that we are coming down with these diseases and it makes people want to go out and get those vaccinations.
[01:45:36.142 --> 01:45:43.187]  Exactly, they give the papillomavirus and they admit now that it's causing it and so then it causes more.
[01:45:43.227 --> 01:45:49.012]  More, because then more people say, oh my gosh, it is, it's rampant, so we have to get these vaccinations now to stop it.
[01:45:49.192 --> 01:45:57.698]  I mean, I'm not saying that it isn't a big deal, but with 300 million people, there were only 9,000 cases in 2005.
[01:45:57.738 --> 01:46:00.600]  That's the latest numbers we have, and 4,000 deaths.
[01:46:00.941 --> 01:46:01.721]  Now, that's a big deal.
[01:46:02.122 --> 01:46:04.383]  But there were hundreds of thousands of car accident deaths.
[01:46:05.344 --> 01:46:09.327]  But then they admit the shot doesn't even cover you, but for six strains, and there's over 300.
[01:46:09.427 --> 01:46:09.887]  Right.
[01:46:10.628 --> 01:46:11.008]  Exactly.
[01:46:11.028 --> 01:46:12.209]  So you could still come down with it.
[01:46:13.001 --> 01:46:17.827]  Well, and did they tell you whenever they were trying to give it to your daughter that it has live virus in it?
[01:46:18.167 --> 01:46:18.367]  No.
[01:46:18.647 --> 01:46:19.428]  Oh, absolutely not.
[01:46:19.488 --> 01:46:22.672]  It's the first popularized live virus, but it's the whole new wave.
[01:46:22.872 --> 01:46:23.092]  Oh, right.
[01:46:23.112 --> 01:46:23.813]  Exactly.
[01:46:23.853 --> 01:46:28.759]  What are you going to do, folks, when they try to tell you your son or daughter has to take one that fixes their brain?
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.161]  And you better go read right now.
[01:46:31.262 --> 01:46:33.184]  It's admittedly attacks the brain.
[01:46:34.728 --> 01:46:36.830]  Cheryl Hall, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:46:36.850 --> 01:46:37.611]  Thank you for having me.
[01:46:37.631 --> 01:46:38.132]  No, thank you.
[01:46:38.152 --> 01:46:42.096]  I hope that I, I mean, if anything, my story is heard and I save at least one person.
[01:46:42.677 --> 01:46:44.639]  Make sure while you're back that they give you a terastorm or something.
[01:46:45.199 --> 01:46:46.541]  Anna, say hi to your fiancé for me.
[01:46:46.561 --> 01:46:46.901]  Alright.
[01:46:47.442 --> 01:46:47.762]  Take care.
[01:46:47.802 --> 01:46:48.263]  Nice to meet you.
[01:46:48.283 --> 01:46:48.623]  Nice to meet you.
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:50.741]  Okay, folks.
[01:46:51.301 --> 01:46:51.902]  Really nice lady.
[01:46:51.922 --> 01:46:55.845]  I appreciate Richard Reeves holding for the last 10 minutes, but this is really important information.
[01:46:55.885 --> 01:46:58.367]  I'll hold him over in the next hour, then we'll get Luke Rodowski on with him.
[01:46:58.827 --> 01:47:01.390]  Richard is hosting his own talk show host here in Austin, Texas.
[01:47:01.650 --> 01:47:06.294]  He's currently doing a local TV show, and we appreciate Richard.
[01:47:06.334 --> 01:47:08.596]  He popped by the office this week.
[01:47:09.356 --> 01:47:12.758]  And he said that what we talked about on air was true.
[01:47:12.818 --> 01:47:19.561]  Callers were calling in saying they had big screens, and they're telling us there were nukes, and that Bin Laden's gonna get us, and 9-11 truth is a lie.
[01:47:19.581 --> 01:47:22.983]  Then I got reports all over the country this is happening at big Republican events.
[01:47:23.223 --> 01:47:25.104]  They had this colonel up there fear-mongering.
[01:47:25.484 --> 01:47:32.948]  And Richard, who normally is very conservative in what he claims, said this was a psy-op at the Ron Paul straw poll, that it was the Republican straw poll.
[01:47:33.508 --> 01:47:37.531]  And we've got witnesses saying they blocked buses that were coming in for Paul.
[01:47:37.571 --> 01:47:41.753]  They did let buses in that had people for the other folks.
[01:47:41.933 --> 01:47:44.615]  I mean, but that's a side issue to the PSYOP.
[01:47:44.975 --> 01:47:46.536]  Richard, set the table for us.
[01:47:46.556 --> 01:47:49.038]  Then we're going to go to break and come back and you can tell us what happened.
[01:47:49.058 --> 01:47:53.180]  In your words, you're saying there was a PSYOP at the Scrawl Poll in Texas.
[01:47:53.941 --> 01:47:54.681]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:47:54.741 --> 01:47:55.642]  And thank you for having me on.
[01:47:55.682 --> 01:47:59.084]  And I just arrived in New York here about 20 minutes ago in a hotel room.
[01:47:59.631 --> 01:48:02.553]  And I'm looking forward to seeing an endgame up here in New York for the first time.
[01:48:02.593 --> 01:48:04.213]  That's why I didn't go to the Alamo Draft House.
[01:48:04.233 --> 01:48:06.354]  That's why I wanted to see it up here in New York with this audience.
[01:48:06.875 --> 01:48:08.696]  But, yes, they did do a PSYOP.
[01:48:08.836 --> 01:48:20.762]  And, you know, I want to start off with the conclusion to all this because I know we're going to be pressed for time, but I have never been more excited about the Ron Paul campaign, never been more excited than right now about the Ron Paul campaign.
[01:48:20.802 --> 01:48:21.342]  I'm telling you.
[01:48:21.822 --> 01:48:23.563]  Let me start off with a football analogy.
[01:48:23.603 --> 01:48:26.665]  You watched that UT game I heard you mention earlier in the week, right?
[01:48:28.382 --> 01:48:36.031]  Yes, well, you know, the score was 21-13, but that didn't tell the whole story because UT won very ugly.
[01:48:36.431 --> 01:48:38.734]  I mean, Arkansas State was in the red zone six times.
[01:48:38.754 --> 01:48:41.837]  They could have scored 25, 30, 40, 42 points.
[01:48:42.598 --> 01:48:45.682]  And that's how this straw poll in Fort Worth worked.
[01:48:46.267 --> 01:48:58.331]  Is that those numbers that they came out with do not tell the complete story because they tweaked and played with these results, not just possibly with the vote counts, but absolutely in that ballroom where these speakers were speaking.
[01:48:58.711 --> 01:49:03.892]  I mean, you had Rick Perry come on there with a video which, by the way, was greeted very unwarmly.
[01:49:03.932 --> 01:49:12.235]  There was little or no applause and, frankly, he got a mild boo when he got on that video screen and even said, even though there's no Texan on the ballot,
[01:49:13.092 --> 01:49:18.514]  And the folks can see that if they just go to YouTube and search Texas Straw Poll Propaganda, and you'll see a clip of that video.
[01:49:18.874 --> 01:49:22.816]  I want to thank Houston911Truth.org for putting that video up.
[01:49:22.876 --> 01:49:24.957]  Yeah, we're going to do a story on it, so run through the elements.
[01:49:24.977 --> 01:49:26.017]  That's awesome.
[01:49:26.057 --> 01:49:39.803]  Well, okay, they came on there with these speakers, and not only did they threaten these delegates with, oh, the terrorists are going to get you, they're going to come here and kill you if we don't go over there and make glass parking lots all over the Middle East and other parts of the world,
[01:49:40.168 --> 01:49:43.709]  But they're going to come here and get you in Texas, in your bedroom, and in your home.
[01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:46.630]  And also, the Ralph Reed... Stay there.
[01:49:46.650 --> 01:49:47.291]  Take your time.
[01:49:47.311 --> 01:49:47.851]  I want to get back.
[01:49:47.891 --> 01:49:51.292]  I want to walk through this, because you called it an official sigh-off.
[01:49:51.352 --> 01:49:52.453]  I want to hear about the sigh-off.
[01:49:55.374 --> 01:49:56.634]  It's here.
[01:49:56.834 --> 01:50:01.596]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:01.976 --> 01:50:09.599]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:17.334]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.754 --> 01:50:29.180]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:33.002]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.443 --> 01:50:35.384]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.724 --> 01:50:39.566]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:52.839 --> 01:50:57.923]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:57.983 --> 01:51:05.309]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:05.449 --> 01:51:16.118]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:16.298 --> 01:51:20.822]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:21.102 --> 01:51:26.087]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:51:26.308 --> 01:51:29.251]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:29.471 --> 01:51:39.241]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:51:52.737 --> 01:51:57.299]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:00.661]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:52:00.961 --> 01:52:03.543]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:52:03.903 --> 01:52:08.725]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:52:09.106 --> 01:52:14.468]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:52:14.768 --> 01:52:17.750]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[01:52:17.930 --> 01:52:18.490]  We're good to go.
[01:52:41.338 --> 01:52:46.539]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:52:46.559 --> 01:52:46.879]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:22.138]  Okay Richard, you were there, at the strophole, and you described it to me, you said it was a complete sigh-off.
[01:53:22.578 --> 01:53:31.586]  And everybody else called saying it's that 9-11 crew is evil, it's not true, a plane did hit the Pentagon, big screens, they've got nukes in America, they're gonna nuke you.
[01:53:31.826 --> 01:53:33.828]  This is what they show you before you vote.
[01:53:35.129 --> 01:53:37.311]  I mean, how obvious and skewing is that?
[01:53:38.024 --> 01:53:39.965]  On top of it, and then I've got all these reports.
[01:53:40.025 --> 01:53:41.545]  I mean, I've had like 15 people call me.
[01:53:41.745 --> 01:53:50.767]  People I know have called me and said, listen, they weren't letting Ron Paul people in who had their, you know, their delegate passes, but then they would let buses pull up for Hunter and let them in.
[01:53:51.007 --> 01:53:53.348]  But tell me about the PsyOps though.
[01:53:53.368 --> 01:53:59.109]  It shows just how desperate the New World Order is to maintain this left-right paradigm.
[01:53:59.129 --> 01:54:00.310]  They are desperate.
[01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:03.171]  And they skewed these numbers probably at least three ways.
[01:54:03.371 --> 01:54:04.931]  One is they restricted who could vote
[01:54:05.616 --> 01:54:06.537]  You had to be a delegate.
[01:54:06.577 --> 01:54:07.578]  It wasn't an open vote.
[01:54:07.618 --> 01:54:08.559]  Everybody could not vote.
[01:54:08.999 --> 01:54:16.386]  We had at least 600 plus Ron Paul supporters in that ballroom that weren't able to vote.
[01:54:16.706 --> 01:54:19.609]  With the Mind Control Psy-Op, let me lay out the way the ballroom was.
[01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:22.952]  The ballroom held between 1,500 and 2,000 people, roughly.
[01:54:23.673 --> 01:54:28.757]  They had these two big giant video projection screens on the left and right side.
[01:54:28.937 --> 01:54:30.619]  In the middle, they had the speaker's podium.
[01:54:31.328 --> 01:54:37.101]  And they'd had these big talking heads on these video screens like Rick Perry and then they had a Ralph Reed video.
[01:54:37.597 --> 01:54:43.020]  They went beyond just threatening you with Osama and terrorists from the Middle East and terrorists from whatever other country.
[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:48.583]  They actually did big hit pieces on Democrats saying how evil Democrats want to kill Republicans.
[01:54:48.603 --> 01:54:57.387]  They showed these historical caricatures and artist renderings and videos of Democrats actually stalking and hunting Republicans because they were bad and evil.
[01:54:57.847 --> 01:55:04.991]  And another nasty rumor that they had floating around is all these Ron Paul supporters wearing t-shirts and buttons and labels and
[01:55:05.567 --> 01:55:09.268]  And, uh, carrying around signs, they're actually Democrats in disguise!
[01:55:10.489 --> 01:55:12.649]  So that's how they propagandized.
[01:55:13.150 --> 01:55:23.073]  That's how they did the... that was the big... Meanwhile, it's the Bushes vacationing with the Clintons, and Mary Madeline's married to Carville, and it's all staged, but... Oh my goodness.
[01:55:23.433 --> 01:55:24.954]  So that's how desperate they are.
[01:55:24.994 --> 01:55:26.734]  Meanwhile, Fox News is behind Hillary.
[01:55:27.154 --> 01:55:28.035]  I'm so sick of them.
[01:55:28.055 --> 01:55:29.015]  I'm so sick of them.
[01:55:29.791 --> 01:55:33.355]  I mean, they've got to propagandize their own delegates to keep them in the corral.
[01:55:33.395 --> 01:55:37.879]  And the good news is, is that Boat Rescue's numbers are a little bit different.
[01:55:37.999 --> 01:55:41.823]  Ron Paul might have gotten as high as upper 20s in percentage numbers.
[01:55:43.044 --> 01:55:45.206]  But, you know, at the very least... He got 17, didn't he?
[01:55:45.746 --> 01:55:50.211]  Well, just for the sake of discussion, let's just use their official numbers that Ron Paul got 16.7%.
[01:55:50.251 --> 01:55:51.192]  Well, that 100 monkey theory
[01:55:54.150 --> 01:55:58.412]  Says you only need about eight out of a hundred to really start taking over.
[01:55:58.873 --> 01:56:05.556]  All those delegates in that room got a taste of constitutional filet mignon speech when Ron Paul spoke.
[01:56:05.996 --> 01:56:08.017]  So they got some truth in them.
[01:56:08.137 --> 01:56:12.840]  I understand that, but they care more about putting little elephant pens on their shirts than actually saving America.
[01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:20.144]  But I mean, expanding on that, what about this colonel that got up and said they had nukes and 9-11 truths, idiots, and I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:56:21.105 --> 01:56:21.345]  Right.
[01:56:21.426 --> 01:56:23.147]  I mean, they just harped on it the whole time.
[01:56:23.787 --> 01:56:24.528]  Tell us his name.
[01:56:24.548 --> 01:56:25.168]  Give us details.
[01:56:25.188 --> 01:56:26.089]  We're doing a story on this.
[01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:28.811]  Well, on this Colonel, I don't remember his name in particular.
[01:56:29.171 --> 01:56:30.232]  I was in and out of the room.
[01:56:30.292 --> 01:56:33.515]  I caught most of what was going on, but I wasn't in the room 100% of the time.
[01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:42.825]  I don't recall the colonel's name, but I just know that you had Duncan Hunter and Ron Paul spoke, and then you had Michael Richards, the railroad commissioner from Texas.
[01:56:43.225 --> 01:56:52.731]  But one of the other things that I'd like to mention is how Duncan Hunter, I do believe he did win this race, but there's key things that he did is he played retail politics.
[01:56:53.252 --> 01:56:55.053]  And retail politics, he came in on Friday.
[01:56:55.623 --> 01:57:02.808]  And he shook every delegate's hand that he possibly could, he looked them in the eye, they introduced each other, and he answered questions for them and all that.
[01:57:03.289 --> 01:57:11.575]  And one of the key things that we've succeeded in, and it's very important, it just really, the light bulb went off in my head this past weekend, is we are almost eliminated
[01:57:12.085 --> 01:57:18.988]  These big guys like Giuliani, McCain, Romney, we've almost eliminated them from participating in retail politics.
[01:57:19.028 --> 01:57:28.192]  And when it comes to these straw polls, and states like New Hampshire, where the state of New Hampshire has roughly the population of the Austin metropolitan area... Bob Paul won!
[01:57:28.252 --> 01:57:30.673]  Stay there, we'll be right back in 70 seconds.
[01:57:32.794 --> 01:57:37.456]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.303 --> 01:57:49.964]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.624 --> 01:57:51.705]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.386 --> 01:57:53.507]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.147 --> 01:57:54.988]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.728 --> 01:57:57.249]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.289 --> 01:58:01.112]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.472 --> 01:58:05.616]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.436 --> 01:58:09.538]  Top story up on PresidentPlanet.com, InfoWars.com,
[01:58:11.499 --> 01:58:12.960]  His neocons have enlisted.
[01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:14.922]  Bin Laden has helped to counter 9-11 truth.
[01:58:14.942 --> 01:58:18.826]  Putting out a new fake video with a younger Bin Laden with no gray.
[01:58:19.447 --> 01:58:21.488]  It is literally a cartoon computer generated.
[01:58:21.508 --> 01:58:22.730]  You can even look at it and tell.
[01:58:23.010 --> 01:58:25.252]  We've got the history of all the other fake videos they put out.
[01:58:25.752 --> 01:58:27.334]  Very important you go read this story.
[01:58:27.374 --> 01:58:28.295]  Get it out to everybody.
[01:58:29.576 --> 01:58:31.117]  Also the trailer for Endgame.
[01:58:31.198 --> 01:58:32.659]  It's really just the intro from the film.
[01:58:32.719 --> 01:58:33.620]  It's a five minute trailer.
[01:58:34.477 --> 01:58:35.097]  We're good to go.
[01:58:57.128 --> 01:59:00.993]  Rumors, legends always have their roots in reality, at least to some extent.
[01:59:01.033 --> 01:59:03.216]  Well, this is worse than the rumors you've heard.
[01:59:03.557 --> 01:59:04.137]  This is worse.
[01:59:04.178 --> 01:59:05.059]  This is documented.
[01:59:06.122 --> 01:59:11.728]  And the elite think they've found the fountain of youth, but to attain it, they want to kill 80% of us.
[01:59:11.748 --> 01:59:13.350]  They're a bunch of sicko control freaks.
[01:59:13.710 --> 01:59:15.032]  Richard Reeves is up in New York.
[01:59:15.072 --> 01:59:15.893]  He's normally in Austin.
[01:59:15.973 --> 01:59:17.354]  I host a TV show here locally.
[01:59:17.695 --> 01:59:22.480]  He was at the Ron Paul Republican straw poll, and Ron Paul got third place there.
[01:59:23.421 --> 01:59:26.965]  But we saw all forms of manipulation and cheating and rigging.
[01:59:27.942 --> 01:59:31.247]  Uh, but, uh, the big deal here is that there was a PSYOP.
[01:59:31.628 --> 01:59:34.392]  Now, Richard, did you see this, what everybody else said they saw?
[01:59:34.833 --> 01:59:43.045]  That buses coming in for Duncan Hunter were allowed to offload their people and get them in, but people that showed up, who were delegates, who were there for Ron Paul, weren't being allowed in?
[01:59:43.897 --> 01:59:50.024]  I didn't see that personally, but I was up in the room and heard reports of it, and you can see clips of that on YouTube.
[01:59:50.184 --> 02:00:01.157]  And that same guy that you see on YouTube, that same security guy, I went down there post the event and was asking if they knew anything about this where Ron Paul delegates were not allowed in.
[02:00:01.597 --> 02:00:03.898]  And the same guy denied that he knew anything about it.
[02:00:03.978 --> 02:00:04.579]  It was a shame.
[02:00:04.619 --> 02:00:07.260]  So, ah, he denied the video.
[02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:09.261]  But thank God the video's out there.
[02:00:09.281 --> 02:00:12.503]  See, used to we didn't have YouTube to prove them liars.
[02:00:12.883 --> 02:00:13.423]  Right, right.
[02:00:13.503 --> 02:00:16.245]  And see, I didn't even know that that was the guy that was involved.
[02:00:16.945 --> 02:00:18.066]  At that moment, I didn't know.
[02:00:18.126 --> 02:00:24.029]  I didn't find out until two or three days later when I'm looking on YouTube to find out about that story about delegates disallowed coming in.
[02:00:24.369 --> 02:00:30.212]  I mean, you even had David and Linda Stahl from CorridorWatch.org were barely allowed in, and that was only because
[02:00:30.754 --> 02:00:40.209]  They had a couple other NEACON delegates that they were allowing in at the same time and so they saw them going in and so they kind of pushed the issue and enforced the issue and were able to get in.
[02:00:40.249 --> 02:00:43.754]  But they were telling me that they'd gotten there like three minutes after 10 a.m.
[02:00:44.215 --> 02:00:45.357]  and they weren't allowing them in.
[02:00:46.238 --> 02:00:48.319]  But they were allowing all the neocons in.
[02:00:48.799 --> 02:00:49.639]  That's what they were saying.
[02:00:49.759 --> 02:00:52.901]  Now David Starling, he's a city manager, former police officer.
[02:00:53.161 --> 02:00:55.942]  He's got the majority of counties to sign on for Corridor Watch.
[02:00:56.182 --> 02:00:57.662]  He's a very credible witness.
[02:00:58.003 --> 02:00:58.263]  Absolutely.
[02:00:58.283 --> 02:01:03.004]  As a matter of fact, he might be a good one to call and get up on the air about that issue of how that went down.
[02:01:03.124 --> 02:01:05.025]  Well, we've got you now confirming that he said that.
[02:01:05.045 --> 02:01:05.805]  We'll put that in the article.
[02:01:05.825 --> 02:01:07.126]  Look, I've talked to people I know.
[02:01:07.426 --> 02:01:09.607]  Richard, you're just the icing on the cake.
[02:01:09.967 --> 02:01:11.908]  And now with Stahl, that's the cherry on top.
[02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:19.274]  We're going to get a report out on this, confirmed though, that you walked and talked to that security guard and he claimed he didn't block any Ron Paul delegates.
[02:01:19.734 --> 02:01:20.675]  That's right, that's right.
[02:01:20.715 --> 02:01:24.978]  Later on during the event, I had no idea he was the one involved.
[02:01:25.158 --> 02:01:32.623]  I was just at that door and that's where the delegates were supposed to come in and I asked those people there and they were all denying any knowledge of that occurring.
[02:01:33.183 --> 02:01:35.165]  It was really pretty hilarious.
[02:01:35.345 --> 02:01:37.286]  In closing, what did they say about 9-11 Truth?
[02:01:37.366 --> 02:01:38.207]  Sum that up for us.
[02:01:39.272 --> 02:01:44.438]  Well, basically they're just saying that the 9-11 truthers are just liberal Democrats just coming in to crash the Republican Party.
[02:01:44.778 --> 02:01:46.480]  That's kind of the sum it up.
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:47.241]  And on top of that...
[02:01:47.645 --> 02:01:55.411]  These evil Democrats in the past, in the 1800s, actually killed Republicans for liking to free the slaves.
[02:01:55.811 --> 02:01:59.794]  So it's just been boiled down to just mindless inter-party warfare.
[02:01:59.854 --> 02:02:11.202]  And again, the leadership of the Republicans and the hacks controlling this know that they're all on the same team, but they use that left-right to keep you in two false brigades so that you're under their control.
[02:02:11.522 --> 02:02:12.843]  Richard, I'll see you in New York.
[02:02:12.883 --> 02:02:13.724]  Thanks for the report.
[02:02:13.984 --> 02:02:14.885]  Okay, thanks to 963 and 90.1.
[02:02:14.985 --> 02:02:15.765]  I appreciate you guys.
[02:02:16.986 --> 02:02:17.366]  You bet.
[02:02:17.426 --> 02:02:18.607]  Take care, my friend.
[02:02:19.208 --> 02:02:19.728]  All right.
[02:02:21.769 --> 02:02:28.354]  I always plug those stations, 100.1 and 90.1, but then the day after I plugged it, I got griped up for not plugging it, so it kind of ruins me plugging them.
[02:02:28.934 --> 02:02:32.097]  So you can listen to me on 1330 a.m.
[02:02:33.558 --> 02:02:41.603]  from North Austin up to Waco, and then on the weekend on Sunday, you can hear me on NewsRadio 590K LBJ, on affiliates all over the country.
[02:02:41.623 --> 02:02:42.504]  I want to thank all of you.
[02:02:44.881 --> 02:02:49.982]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:02:50.042 --> 02:02:57.344]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:02:57.504 --> 02:03:08.146]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:03:08.326 --> 02:03:12.867]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:03:13.167 --> 02:03:18.152]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[02:03:18.352 --> 02:03:21.295]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:03:21.515 --> 02:03:31.305]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[02:03:31.445 --> 02:03:35.608]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:35.628 --> 02:03:41.912]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:08.945]  TerrorStorm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.346 --> 02:04:12.288]  TerrorStorm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:04:12.668 --> 02:04:15.010]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:04:15.410 --> 02:04:16.191]  NSA Spy.
[02:04:16.710 --> 02:04:20.753]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.073 --> 02:04:24.556]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.036 --> 02:04:26.997]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.297 --> 02:04:31.240]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:44.443 --> 02:04:47.364]  Where do you think one of the most toxic places on earth is?
[02:04:47.664 --> 02:04:48.904]  The answer may surprise you.
[02:04:49.084 --> 02:04:50.064]  It's in your body.
[02:04:50.324 --> 02:04:54.165]  The colon is a natural breeding ground for disease-producing germs.
[02:04:54.425 --> 02:04:58.547]  It may not sound like a very appealing subject, but it should not go ignored.
[02:04:58.707 --> 02:05:05.908]  For over a decade now, natural health expert Dr. Lauren Ritter has educated people everywhere about the benefits of internal cleansing.
[02:05:06.148 --> 02:05:08.389]  Now these benefits include higher energy levels,
[02:05:08.669 --> 02:05:12.934]  More comfortable digestion, high immune support, and healthier looking skin.
[02:05:13.254 --> 02:05:17.860]  Now you can try Dr. Ritter's colon cleansing program from the privacy of your own home.
[02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:22.545]  It's safe and natural, and it gently cleanses the entire digestive tract.
[02:05:22.725 --> 02:05:25.408]  Don't let your body be the most toxic place on earth.
[02:05:25.729 --> 02:05:28.592]  Take care of your health by cleansing your colon and body.
[02:05:28.872 --> 02:05:29.292]  Dial 1-800-890-2014.
[02:05:29.312 --> 02:05:29.552]  That's 1-800-890-2014.
[02:05:29.592 --> 02:05:32.834]  Call now to find out how you can get the colon and body cleanse risk-free for 30 days.
[02:05:32.874 --> 02:05:33.194]  Dial 1-800-890-2014.
[02:05:33.274 --> 02:05:33.615]  Call now.
[02:05:33.635 --> 02:05:37.317]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:37.337 --> 02:05:39.158]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:54.071 --> 02:06:08.837]  We're going to get one final report from Luke Radowsky and then the kickoff of resistance to the 9-11 hoax starts as we demonstrate and have actions and have events the next four days, five days in New York City.
[02:06:08.857 --> 02:06:13.199]  Luke Radowsky popping in in just a moment and I'm going to run through some news we haven't gotten to yet today.
[02:06:13.219 --> 02:06:15.920]  There's quite a bit of that so be sure and stay with us.
[02:06:18.081 --> 02:06:19.202]  Before I go any further
[02:06:20.347 --> 02:06:25.510]  I want to tell you about somebody I want to get back on the show and just what an excellent magazine it is.
[02:06:25.530 --> 02:06:31.774]  I remember about four years ago I told him he ought to sponsor the Genesis Network and he has been a sponsor since then.
[02:06:32.855 --> 02:06:37.838]  And I was just thinking about what a good faithful sponsor he's been and how good his magazine is.
[02:06:38.218 --> 02:06:45.723]  It's newswatchmagazine.org newswatchmagazine.org and the number is 1-800-516-8736
[02:06:50.496 --> 02:06:51.277]  David J. Smith.
[02:06:51.317 --> 02:06:52.818]  I mean, it looks like Time Magazine.
[02:06:52.838 --> 02:06:54.839]  It is a glossy, nice magazine.
[02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:58.081]  He's got a great church up in Waxahachie, Texas.
[02:06:58.221 --> 02:06:59.843]  There's very few good churches left out there.
[02:06:59.883 --> 02:07:01.944]  And I lived up in Waxahachie, just south of Dallas.
[02:07:02.204 --> 02:07:04.686]  If you live in Dallas, it's worth the 30-minute drive to go to.
[02:07:05.587 --> 02:07:08.208]  He is just right outside Waxahachie.
[02:07:09.189 --> 02:07:10.070]  Wonderful pastor.
[02:07:10.090 --> 02:07:10.150]  1-800-516-8736.

[02:07:35.547 --> 02:07:37.868]  They've got great books and films and things as well.
[02:07:37.888 --> 02:07:39.789]  But you'll find out about those in the magazine.

[02:07:41.110 --> 02:07:41.951]  It's an easy call.

[02:07:45.615 --> 02:07:48.197]  36.
[02:07:45.675 --> 02:07:48.197]  David J. Smith has published Newswatch Magazine since August 1980.
[02:07:48.337 --> 02:07:53.040]  Newswatch Magazine is currently running a series about the history of the rise of world government.
[02:07:53.501 --> 02:07:54.281]  The New World Order.
[02:07:54.301 --> 02:07:56.943]  The series is entitled History That Must Be Told.
[02:07:57.003 --> 02:08:00.286]  It starts with over 300 years ago and brings up the current time.
[02:08:00.366 --> 02:08:02.108]  That's why it's such an important publication.
[02:08:02.368 --> 02:08:03.809]  His knowledge is very deep.
[02:08:04.469 --> 02:08:08.913]  My uncle was listening to David J. Smith before I even got on the air, folks.
[02:08:11.314 --> 02:08:16.016]  My uncle told me about David J. Smith, and he's one of the people that helped wake me up, okay?
[02:08:17.797 --> 02:08:24.580]  NewsWatch is offering an introductory one-year free subscription to all who call the toll-free number between 8 and 4 p.m.
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:26.061]  Central Time, 800-516-8736.
[02:08:26.141 --> 02:08:31.944]  Give them a call, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:33.265 --> 02:08:33.605]  Okay.
[02:08:34.965 --> 02:08:35.846]  Luke Radowski.
[02:08:36.006 --> 02:08:39.888]  Luke, I am looking forward to shaking your hand tomorrow, my friend.
[02:08:40.883 --> 02:08:44.584]  And I look forward to seeing you.
[02:08:44.964 --> 02:08:46.024]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[02:08:46.384 --> 02:08:47.365]  Nah man, thanks for having me.
[02:08:47.385 --> 02:08:49.005]  I can't wait to see you tomorrow too, brother.
[02:08:49.905 --> 02:08:56.647]  This is really shaping up to be huge, and I wanted to dwarf the 2,000 people that we had out there at Ground Zero last year.
[02:08:57.827 --> 02:09:01.988]  Conservatively, 3,000 total in a couple days of events, but about 2,000 at any one time.
[02:09:02.908 --> 02:09:05.429]  Folks, this is historic, and I've got this V for Vendetta clip.
[02:09:05.449 --> 02:09:06.689]  I don't know if we have time to play it, but
[02:09:08.688 --> 02:09:24.194]  They have a statement about, if you feel as I feel, if you believe the crimes of this government have gone on too long and be on the streets on September 11th between 7 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon right out there at Ground Zero in your black 9-11 Truth t-shirt preferably.
[02:09:24.914 --> 02:09:26.655]  But there's a lot of other events aren't there Luke?
[02:09:26.695 --> 02:09:27.535]  Run through them for us.
[02:09:27.815 --> 02:09:30.436]  Well today we start off, we start off making history today.
[02:09:30.456 --> 02:09:34.618]  We're going to be outside the Pratt House, CFR headquarters today, 4 o'clock.
[02:09:35.038 --> 02:09:48.349]  We're going to be out there with our Not-11-Wizard inside job signs, with our DVDs, with our flyers, and we're going to let the CFR know, we're going to let the scum inside the Council on Foreign Relations know that Not-11 was sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, and we're going to be out there.
[02:09:48.369 --> 02:09:50.490]  We're going to start off our street actions today.
[02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:59.978]  I hope everybody in the Tri-State area joins us here in New York City, and if people aren't in the Tri-State area, they could actually see the street action live on WeAreChange.org.
[02:10:00.598 --> 02:10:06.149]  And we start off today outside the Council on Foreign Relations, the Pride House, today at 4 o'clock.
[02:10:06.189 --> 02:10:08.674]  And I hope people join us today out in the street action.
[02:10:10.086 --> 02:10:10.647]  Absolutely.
[02:10:10.727 --> 02:10:11.707]  Run through the gamut.
[02:10:11.787 --> 02:10:16.051]  Run through the different events that you're going to have the next four or five days.
[02:10:16.411 --> 02:10:20.134]  Well, of course, today we have street action outside the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:10:20.154 --> 02:10:27.980]  We're going to go all over upper Manhattan and march throughout all of Manhattan and educate as many people as we can about the New World Order and 9-11.
[02:10:28.340 --> 02:10:34.164]  After that's finished, next Saturday we're going to be doing a street action at Ground Zero from about 12-4.
[02:10:34.645 --> 02:10:38.448]  After we're done with that, we're going to gather at Times Square.
[02:10:39.125 --> 02:10:41.307]  From 6 all the way up to the night.
[02:10:41.648 --> 02:10:43.109]  And again, it's all about outreach.
[02:10:43.129 --> 02:10:44.410]  It's all about doing street action.
[02:10:44.430 --> 02:10:48.694]  It's all about talking to an individual and changing their world and educating them for the better.
[02:10:49.195 --> 02:10:54.900]  And after that, Sunday, we're going to do street action outside Union Square from 12 to about 3 o'clock.
[02:10:55.441 --> 02:11:00.346]  4 o'clock, our venue starts at Webster Hall, which is right down, right here in Lower Manhattan.
[02:11:00.846 --> 02:11:02.747]  It's one of the best nightclubs here in New York City.
[02:11:03.127 --> 02:11:04.608]  It fits about 3,000 people.
[02:11:04.948 --> 02:11:05.949]  We want to fill the place.
[02:11:05.969 --> 02:11:13.053]  We have great people like Richard Gage, family members, rescue workers, Christina Ebersole, Daniel Sanjada, The Loose Change.
[02:11:13.413 --> 02:11:14.394]  Of course, we're going to have you.
[02:11:14.414 --> 02:11:15.614]  We're going to be Premier Endgame.
[02:11:15.875 --> 02:11:18.816]  We're going to have M1, Bedouin, and Immortal Technique.
[02:11:18.936 --> 02:11:19.937]  It's a huge venue.
[02:11:19.977 --> 02:11:20.917]  It's a huge event.
[02:11:21.218 --> 02:11:25.640]  It's going to be one of the biggest not-unlimited events in history, and I hope people can make it out there.
[02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:28.662]  After that day is over, we're all going to meet in Manhattan.
[02:11:29.444 --> 02:11:29.884]  I think so.
[02:11:52.513 --> 02:11:53.894]  In 9-11 truth history ever.
[02:11:54.154 --> 02:12:02.677]  When that day is over, 9-11 07 is going to come around and we're going to have a peaceful vigil, a silent vigil in memory for all the ones that were lost in 9-11.
[02:12:03.137 --> 02:12:07.778]  And we're going to be there with family members, rescue workers, with black t-shirts, and we're going to make a statement.
[02:12:07.858 --> 02:12:09.799]  And this makes the New World Order so mad.
[02:12:09.819 --> 02:12:11.039]  It makes them so mad.
[02:12:11.439 --> 02:12:18.642]  They've talked about not even having memorials anymore because it's hard for the media to cover up when there's a couple thousand 9-11 truthers out there.
[02:12:19.202 --> 02:12:23.266]  Because they want to use the murder they committed to get more police state and kill the country further.
[02:12:23.286 --> 02:12:25.588]  And it makes them so mad that we're there, folks.
[02:12:26.029 --> 02:12:26.569]  It really does.
[02:12:26.589 --> 02:12:31.054]  I mean, even the New York Times released an article a couple weeks ago saying how we should forget about 9-11.
[02:12:31.294 --> 02:12:34.197]  And not even have a memorial day at Ground Zero.
[02:12:34.577 --> 02:12:36.820]  And we have to remember, we can't forget 9-11.
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:38.241]  We can't never forget.
[02:12:38.261 --> 02:12:39.643]  We have to investigate 9-11.
[02:12:39.683 --> 02:12:40.844]  We can't forget 9-11.
[02:12:40.864 --> 02:12:42.766]  9-11 is the key to basically everything.
[02:12:42.786 --> 02:12:44.928]  To, you know, saving this country.
[02:12:44.988 --> 02:12:47.892]  Taking back our country from the criminal elite, which have taken it back.
[02:12:48.212 --> 02:12:51.896]  We have to show these criminal elite... See, the criminals come back to the crime scene.
[02:12:52.236 --> 02:13:00.718]  We have Giuliani, we have George Bush, we have Pataki, all these criminals coming back to the crime scene on 9-11 and being praised as heroes.
[02:13:01.018 --> 02:13:01.878]  We can't have that.
[02:13:01.918 --> 02:13:02.779]  We can't allow that.
[02:13:03.099 --> 02:13:07.160]  Even the family members here in New York City are outraged that Giuliani is going to be a part of the memorial.
[02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:16.822]  In fact, the news reported, TV and the paper reported, that the majority of families, I forget the number, like 90-something percent, don't want Giuliani to be there.
[02:13:17.495 --> 02:13:18.836]  What was that report?
[02:13:18.876 --> 02:13:19.476]  I gotta dig that.
[02:13:19.496 --> 02:13:20.237]  It was like a week ago?
[02:13:20.757 --> 02:13:22.579]  Yeah, the family members, they're outraged.
[02:13:22.599 --> 02:13:24.120]  The family members are on our side.
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:28.683]  The family members will be speaking at our events about how outraged they are.
[02:13:29.063 --> 02:13:35.948]  About how the administration, how the government is using their family's debts to justify a New World Order.
[02:13:36.308 --> 02:13:37.529]  And that's not what it's about.
[02:13:37.549 --> 02:13:38.850]  It's about taking this country back.
[02:13:38.890 --> 02:13:40.972]  It's about honoring the people who were lost.
[02:13:41.032 --> 02:13:44.995]  And it's about doing the right thing and making a general statement that we will not stand up for this.
[02:13:45.635 --> 02:13:47.376]  We will do what's right.
[02:13:47.457 --> 02:13:48.337]  We will be there.
[02:13:48.397 --> 02:13:49.898]  We will not be scared.
[02:13:50.159 --> 02:13:54.762]  And we will do the right things instead of backing down or letting these criminals be there.
[02:13:57.064 --> 02:13:58.185]  Absolutely, my friend.
[02:13:58.505 --> 02:14:02.048]  Luke Hrodowski, tell people to line up specifically on Saturday.
[02:14:02.108 --> 02:14:03.449]  I fly in in the afternoon.
[02:14:04.207 --> 02:14:12.215]  I'm hooking up with you in the evening for a big meet-up because we want to see a demonstration of the Oakland There's No First Amendment come after us.
[02:14:12.235 --> 02:14:15.298]  I want to see everybody out there tomorrow night specifically.
[02:14:15.638 --> 02:14:17.019]  Where are we hooking up tomorrow night?
[02:14:17.279 --> 02:14:23.926]  Tomorrow night we're going to meet outside Times Square right outside the recruiting station on 42nd Street here in Times Square.
[02:14:24.486 --> 02:14:27.028]  And, uh, the police department have been very hard-headed with us.
[02:14:27.068 --> 02:14:28.709]  They have not been issuing us permits.
[02:14:28.969 --> 02:14:30.230]  But we will still be out there.
[02:14:30.250 --> 02:14:30.970]  Now let's be clear.
[02:14:31.030 --> 02:14:32.371]  See, that's how it was in Australia.
[02:14:32.631 --> 02:14:35.093]  First they say you gotta have a permit, and they say no permit's issued.
[02:14:35.393 --> 02:14:38.034]  It's just like they say you gotta have a permit for a gun, and no permit's issued.
[02:14:38.415 --> 02:14:44.598]  We don't have to have a permit to be out there on the street in America, and let those little criminal goons try what they want.
[02:14:44.958 --> 02:14:46.059]  Yeah, I wanna put this on record.
[02:14:46.079 --> 02:14:47.400]  The New York Mayor's office,
[02:14:47.944 --> 02:14:53.127]  And the NYPD have not been giving us any permits, even though we have properly asked for them.
[02:14:53.187 --> 02:14:55.589]  I want to put this on record, they have not given us anything.
[02:14:55.889 --> 02:14:59.812]  And no matter what, we still have the First Amendment and we will be there legally.
[02:15:00.152 --> 02:15:06.896]  Look folks, if they win and chill, in Canada, Australia, England, the United States, Germany, the Netherlands it's happening.
[02:15:07.236 --> 02:15:10.638]  People wear shirts, they say you can't walk around in the Netherlands with a 9-11 proof shirt.
[02:15:11.199 --> 02:15:13.000]  If they win, the next step's camps.
[02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:14.120]  This is what they know.
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:14.921]  It's a formula.
[02:15:15.241 --> 02:15:19.542]  And if they're able to chill demonstration, chill you being able to be on the streets, stop that.
[02:15:19.622 --> 02:15:20.382]  It's over, folks.
[02:15:20.662 --> 02:15:25.284]  We have to go down there, and I want to see people there for the first test tomorrow night.
[02:15:25.724 --> 02:15:31.666]  I'm going to be there, and I probably won't get down there until about 7 o'clock or so, or 8 o'clock, Luke, and I'll see you there.
[02:15:32.441 --> 02:15:33.642]  I mean, I'll see you there, too.
[02:15:34.042 --> 02:15:36.463]  And people have to stand up for their rights.
[02:15:36.603 --> 02:15:37.983]  See, when does that kick off?
[02:15:38.023 --> 02:15:48.807]  Because, see, I heard it was starting about the time I'm landing, but I need time to, you know, get there and get set up and everything, so I think it's better that everybody converge at one time instead of straggling it out.
[02:15:49.388 --> 02:15:50.488]  When is it supposed to kick off?
[02:15:50.708 --> 02:15:52.269]  It's supposed to kick off 6 o'clock.
[02:15:52.889 --> 02:15:55.070]  6 o'clock at Times Square, right by the recruitment station.
[02:15:56.602 --> 02:16:01.964]  Okay, well we'll go for that, but if you get problems, folks, wander off, and then come back and reconverge.
[02:16:02.084 --> 02:16:05.385]  I think 8 o'clock is the key time to make sure everybody can get there.
[02:16:05.805 --> 02:16:07.206]  Alright, 8 o'clock times square then.
[02:16:07.486 --> 02:16:08.706]  I guess that's cool then.
[02:16:08.926 --> 02:16:20.230]  Well, I've also got Discovery Channel telling me, you know, they're following me from the airport over there, and then I'm going to meet with you there, and by the time I get from the airport, let's say the plane's late, and I'm worried about things like that, Luke.
[02:16:20.771 --> 02:16:25.873]  Yeah, you never know what's going to happen, but we're going to be out there no matter what, and we're going to be standing up for our rights.
[02:16:26.334 --> 02:16:30.635]  And we have to assert our rights, because if we don't use our rights, we're not going to have any rights left.
[02:16:30.936 --> 02:16:37.038]  And we have to use them, we have to stand up for them, we have to make sure our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, is in place.
[02:16:37.098 --> 02:16:41.120]  Think about it in the United States, though, that they tell you you can't have a 9-11 truth shirt.
[02:16:41.620 --> 02:16:42.821]  Think about doing it in Australia.
[02:16:42.841 --> 02:16:44.622]  I mean, that's how far we've slid.
[02:16:45.122 --> 02:16:46.563]  That's how far we've gone.
[02:16:46.643 --> 02:16:47.303]  And in Austin,
[02:16:47.958 --> 02:16:55.703]  When, you know, a hundred of us are standing on a sidewalk, they say, you can't do that, and they threaten to arrest us, and we have to literally have brinksmanship and play chicken with them.
[02:16:56.463 --> 02:16:58.665]  I mean, that's how far this country's gone.
[02:16:58.685 --> 02:17:05.909]  And cops, when they take your pension fund, and you're out trying to protest, and other cops are breaking your skull in, just remember it.
[02:17:06.488 --> 02:17:12.791]  Yeah, I mean, even here in New York City, they called in a false bomb threat on us because we had a political message outside of Ivory Service Team's office.
[02:17:13.172 --> 02:17:14.052]  That's how bad it gets.
[02:17:14.292 --> 02:17:16.073]  But we have to stand up like we did.
[02:17:16.673 --> 02:17:17.834]  We can't stop filming.
[02:17:17.854 --> 02:17:18.995]  We have to put everything on record.
[02:17:19.015 --> 02:17:22.516]  That's all the more reason I want to do the first test tomorrow night.
[02:17:22.937 --> 02:17:25.858]  I want to see a bunch of people get there about 7, 7.30, 8 o'clock.
[02:17:26.198 --> 02:17:28.119]  Converge, get there earlier if you can.
[02:17:28.139 --> 02:17:29.540]  I want to see you there.
[02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:30.601]  Luke, I'll see you.
[02:17:31.662 --> 02:17:40.491]  Right there in the big head of Babylon, right there in evil central, right there in Times Square in front of that giant recruiting abomination.
[02:17:40.851 --> 02:17:41.392]  We'll be there.
[02:17:41.432 --> 02:17:42.573]  God bless you, Luke Rudowsky.
[02:17:45.268 --> 02:17:48.269]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:17:48.589 --> 02:17:53.511]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:17:53.771 --> 02:17:58.132]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:17:58.413 --> 02:18:07.336]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:18:07.536 --> 02:18:11.157]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:18:11.457 --> 02:18:16.482]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:18:16.782 --> 02:18:23.469]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:18:23.979 --> 02:18:24.640]  What about you?
[02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:30.645]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:18:30.705 --> 02:18:31.786]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:18:31.866 --> 02:18:33.768]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:18:44.901 --> 02:18:46.443]  Ted Anderson for Minus Resources.
[02:18:46.503 --> 02:18:46.944]  September 7, 2007.
[02:18:47.124 --> 02:18:47.445]  Gold 702.70.
[02:18:47.605 --> 02:18:50.049]  Else gold coins can be purchased for $724.91, $357.55 per half, $178.78 per quarter.
[02:18:50.089 --> 02:18:50.489]  That's $702.91, $357.55, and $178.78.
[02:19:00.524 --> 02:19:03.145]  Hedge funds caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[02:19:03.185 --> 02:19:04.945]  The bond market continues to slump.
[02:19:05.125 --> 02:19:05.405]  J.P.
[02:19:05.465 --> 02:19:08.366]  Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[02:19:08.406 --> 02:19:10.567]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[02:19:10.647 --> 02:19:15.408]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[02:19:15.468 --> 02:19:17.829]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[02:19:17.969 --> 02:19:22.290]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[02:19:22.610 --> 02:19:23.030]  The U.S.
[02:19:23.070 --> 02:19:27.331]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[02:19:27.431 --> 02:19:29.152]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[02:19:29.592 --> 02:19:32.273]  Economist Rudy Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[02:19:32.553 --> 02:19:33.713]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[02:19:33.853 --> 02:19:39.315]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[02:19:39.395 --> 02:19:39.635]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:39.655 --> 02:19:39.835]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.003 --> 02:19:49.046]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:19:49.266 --> 02:19:52.668]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:19:52.828 --> 02:19:56.331]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:19:56.571 --> 02:19:59.913]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:19:59.973 --> 02:20:05.317]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:20:05.357 --> 02:20:10.521]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[02:20:11.221 --> 02:20:11.602]  Thank you!
[02:20:28.436 --> 02:20:31.881]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:20:31.921 --> 02:20:32.823]  That toll free number again?
[02:20:32.843 --> 02:20:32.903]  1-877-928-8822.
[02:20:46.536 --> 02:20:50.598]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[02:20:51.358 --> 02:20:59.162]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[02:20:59.182 --> 02:21:11.808]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[02:21:11.888 --> 02:21:12.388]  Central.
[02:21:12.768 --> 02:21:14.669]  Formidable Alex Jones says,
[02:21:15.425 --> 02:21:19.126]  This is a network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[02:21:19.826 --> 02:21:26.148]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[02:21:26.688 --> 02:21:31.790]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[02:21:32.530 --> 02:21:38.012]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[02:21:38.412 --> 02:21:39.812]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[02:21:39.892 --> 02:21:41.933]  Central with The Divided Kingdom.
[02:22:10.851 --> 02:22:13.694]  Coming up, we found the author, Alan Wiseman, getting all this attention.
[02:22:13.754 --> 02:22:15.776]  We should play about a minute of it when we get back in the next segment.
[02:22:16.356 --> 02:22:18.178]  Saying, let's just get this straightened over with.
[02:22:18.198 --> 02:22:19.038]  We're going to get rid of everybody.
[02:22:19.058 --> 02:22:20.880]  We're going to be better off when there's no humans.
[02:22:22.201 --> 02:22:23.743]  That's the elite wanting to get rid of us.
[02:22:24.723 --> 02:22:29.508]  Now, in the land of the free, home of the brave, from Austin, Texas to Manhattan, New York.
[02:22:31.930 --> 02:22:33.131]  I talked to the Discovery Channel.
[02:22:34.147 --> 02:22:36.768]  By the way, this is a famous filmmaker doing it for Discovery Channel.
[02:22:36.788 --> 02:22:38.929]  The only reason I'm doing it, because I know it's all hit pieces.
[02:22:38.949 --> 02:22:40.310]  This one, they claim, isn't.
[02:22:40.410 --> 02:22:42.271]  I knew the history was.
[02:22:42.311 --> 02:22:44.532]  This one, I think, is going to be just straight down the middle.
[02:22:46.653 --> 02:22:52.296]  They did big Metallica documentaries and documentaries like Brother's Keeper and Grey Matter.
[02:22:54.217 --> 02:22:57.598]  What's the famous one about the people getting set up for murder up in Arkansas?
[02:23:02.305 --> 02:23:05.408]  They've told Discovery Channel, and now they have to buy permits.
[02:23:06.328 --> 02:23:13.774]  I mean, just to film me getting off the plane, just to film with a camera, me walking out to get in a car, is thousands of dollars for them.
[02:23:13.814 --> 02:23:15.976]  That's how the system works, with a permit.
[02:23:16.236 --> 02:23:17.678]  See, not First Amendment, it's a permit.
[02:23:18.278 --> 02:23:19.939]  And they've told them, no permits for the city.
[02:23:20.139 --> 02:23:21.020]  You don't get permits.
[02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:28.326]  They've told Discovery Channel that on 9-11 and for any of these events, anywhere in the state, you don't have a permit.
[02:23:28.766 --> 02:23:30.548]  And Discovery Channel says they've never seen anything like it.
[02:23:31.104 --> 02:23:36.008]  And now the Film Commission has ordered that no one film in the city.
[02:23:36.028 --> 02:23:40.851]  Now imagine in America, with them cramming cameras down our throats, they just declare this power.
[02:23:42.212 --> 02:23:42.793]  They're criminals!
[02:23:43.533 --> 02:23:51.579]  And believe me folks, you're going to see slack-jawed, pot-bellied, America-hating cops walking over with pleasure going, let me tell you something.
[02:23:52.199 --> 02:23:57.043]  You turns it off, so you leaves it now, or you goes to the prisons.
[02:23:58.455 --> 02:24:00.637]  I mean, it's right out of Goodfellas, folks.
[02:24:00.677 --> 02:24:01.478]  It's worse than that.
[02:24:02.539 --> 02:24:03.860]  It's right out of Clockwork Orange.
[02:24:04.100 --> 02:24:07.003]  They'll have other cops saying, hey, thank you, good job, but it won't matter.
[02:24:07.023 --> 02:24:08.164]  They got the nasty ones.
[02:24:08.825 --> 02:24:10.646]  And listen, you need to experience this.
[02:24:10.706 --> 02:24:12.168]  America is dying, folks.
[02:24:12.508 --> 02:24:14.450]  This is the direct murder of the country.
[02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:16.752]  Luke, you went in to try to get permits.
[02:24:16.812 --> 02:24:19.074]  See, go get a permit for anywhere in the city.
[02:24:19.094 --> 02:24:19.715]  What did they tell you?
[02:24:19.975 --> 02:24:21.317]  We try to do everything illegally.
[02:24:21.357 --> 02:24:22.678]  We try to apply for a permit.
[02:24:22.878 --> 02:24:23.378]  I don't know.
[02:24:40.166 --> 02:24:52.742]  In lower Manhattan, on the day of 9-11, that means no sound identification permits, no film shooting permits, and the people from Discovery have called me and told me, no, we can't shoot you at ground zero, we can't film you at ground zero.
[02:24:52.762 --> 02:24:54.384]  Now again, let's be clear about this, though.
[02:24:54.584 --> 02:24:56.046]  In Australia, no protest.
[02:24:56.486 --> 02:24:57.006]  No shirt!
[02:24:58.027 --> 02:25:02.409]  But understand, see, first they trick you, just like, how did churches go under IRS regulation?
[02:25:02.429 --> 02:25:12.155]  They just said, oh, you got your First Amendment, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, but just sign this form, and then we don't issue the form no more.
[02:25:12.655 --> 02:25:17.858]  You got your Second Amendment, just get the permit, and then we don't offer that no more.
[02:25:17.978 --> 02:25:18.198]  No more.
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:22.644]  And see, he's not allowed to demonstrate.
[02:25:22.684 --> 02:25:24.386]  Not allowed to stand on the street corner.
[02:25:24.586 --> 02:25:26.008]  Not allowed to have a sign.
[02:25:26.228 --> 02:25:28.190]  Not allowed to stand on a soapbox.
[02:25:28.470 --> 02:25:30.132]  You know, I got machine guns.
[02:25:31.174 --> 02:25:32.335]  You got a bomb on you?
[02:25:32.515 --> 02:25:34.518]  I know you don't got a bomb, but I'll say you do.
[02:25:35.524 --> 02:25:38.607]  See, committing crime right there on video and they don't care.
[02:25:38.847 --> 02:25:39.688]  Don't be intimidated.
[02:25:39.728 --> 02:25:42.790]  I want everybody in mass today at 4 o'clock at the CFR.
[02:25:43.210 --> 02:25:49.095]  I want everybody in mass tomorrow night out there in front of that recruiting office to the New World Order.
[02:25:49.496 --> 02:25:50.436]  And I want everybody there on 9-11.
[02:25:50.456 --> 02:25:50.917]  Tell them, Luke!
[02:25:52.478 --> 02:25:53.359]  I mean, be out there.
[02:25:53.379 --> 02:25:54.780]  I mean, it's either now or never.
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:56.442]  It's either we make history now or never.
[02:25:56.842 --> 02:25:57.944]  First, they issue permits.
[02:25:58.164 --> 02:25:59.445]  So we apply for these permits.
[02:25:59.505 --> 02:26:00.466]  And they turn us down.
[02:26:00.506 --> 02:26:02.788]  They turn us down because we're doing the right thing.
[02:26:03.069 --> 02:26:04.310]  We're going after their system.
[02:26:04.590 --> 02:26:06.332]  It's our First Amendment right to be there.
[02:26:06.552 --> 02:26:08.354]  Let's exercise that First Amendment right.
[02:26:08.374 --> 02:26:09.555]  Let's make sure we're there.
[02:26:09.915 --> 02:26:11.837]  You know, there's no way they could shut us down.
[02:26:11.857 --> 02:26:15.561]  There's no way they could arrest our family members and rescue workers.
[02:26:15.581 --> 02:26:17.883]  There's no way they could arrest family members and rescue workers.
[02:26:17.903 --> 02:26:19.004]  Oh, by the way, you told the cops!
[02:26:19.304 --> 02:26:22.948]  You told the cops that it was for mainline police and firemen groups.
[02:26:22.968 --> 02:26:24.990]  I mean, these are the big foundations you've got coming.
[02:26:25.010 --> 02:26:28.574]  I mean, these are mainline groups, and they just said, we don't care if it's for us!
[02:26:28.734 --> 02:26:30.175]  We like the poison dust!
[02:26:30.395 --> 02:26:31.597]  Now get out of here!
[02:26:32.057 --> 02:26:32.697]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:26:32.757 --> 02:26:36.178]  I told them we're doing everything for the police officers, for the firefighters.
[02:26:36.198 --> 02:26:37.919]  We're doing everything- We like dying, Luke!
[02:26:38.139 --> 02:26:39.259]  We like the vaccines!
[02:26:39.299 --> 02:26:40.560]  We like to die of coke!
[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:48.402]  These people are sick and disgusting because they'd rather keep their own jobs than help out their own brothers and support the real people in America that want to save this country.
[02:26:48.642 --> 02:26:51.063]  And we have to stand up for what's right no matter what.
[02:26:51.363 --> 02:26:53.864]  We are doing a fundraiser for the first responders.
[02:26:54.184 --> 02:26:57.505]  And the NYPD, whose first responders are dying in it,
[02:26:57.885 --> 02:26:58.305]  And sick?
[02:26:58.385 --> 02:26:59.406]  Don't even want to help us!
[02:26:59.446 --> 02:27:01.247]  That's how sick and disgusting it gets, man!
[02:27:01.467 --> 02:27:01.987]  They love it!
[02:27:02.027 --> 02:27:02.907]  They love it!
[02:27:03.187 --> 02:27:07.089]  And they take their kids in and inject them and they go into seizures and the cops go, yeah!
[02:27:07.489 --> 02:27:09.130]  More injections in my child!
[02:27:09.210 --> 02:27:10.251]  I love the government!
[02:27:10.691 --> 02:27:11.331]  Just fine!
[02:27:11.391 --> 02:27:11.891]  Believe it!
[02:27:11.991 --> 02:27:12.872]  Be cursed by it!
[02:27:13.232 --> 02:27:13.572]  Love it!
[02:27:13.752 --> 02:27:15.393]  It isn't us hurting you, it's your masters!
[02:27:15.793 --> 02:27:17.234]  Good job, Luke Rodowski!
[02:27:17.514 --> 02:27:22.936]  I'll see you there on the front line of the Info War tomorrow in Times Square!
[02:27:23.216 --> 02:27:24.457]  We're gonna make history, brother!
[02:27:24.597 --> 02:27:25.057]  We are!
[02:27:25.117 --> 02:27:26.117]  I'll see you there!
[02:27:26.137 --> 02:27:27.038]  Alright, brother.
[02:27:35.157 --> 02:27:38.163]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.085 --> 02:27:41.769]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.846 --> 02:27:48.387]  What's better than a tiny tiger in your tank?
[02:27:48.707 --> 02:27:50.267]  A tornado under your hood!
[02:27:50.467 --> 02:27:56.209]  The Tornado is an easy to install, maintenance-free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[02:27:56.509 --> 02:28:03.590]  I personally commissioned an independent test to verify results in six vehicles, and all of them gained MPG with Tornado.
[02:28:03.730 --> 02:28:08.512]  With today's gas prices, it makes sense to cage the gas-saving power of a Tornado.
[02:28:08.692 --> 02:28:14.213]  Visit TornadoAir.com or pick up your Tornado at Checkers, Shucks, and Cragen today!
[02:28:16.196 --> 02:28:19.938]  In today's world of discord and disappointment, one thing's for sure.
[02:28:20.198 --> 02:28:25.000]  Car cover owners are so satisfied, they buy their car covers all over again.
[02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:26.760]  Think car covers are a hassle?
[02:28:27.021 --> 02:28:27.241]  No.
[02:28:27.581 --> 02:28:31.342]  Research shows owners find covers easy to put on and take off.
[02:28:31.743 --> 02:28:33.103]  Are all covers the same?
[02:28:33.343 --> 02:28:33.583]  No.
[02:28:33.863 --> 02:28:37.525]  The standard in car cover fabric is Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:28:37.925 --> 02:28:40.066]  Don't let sun and dust damage your car.
[02:28:40.346 --> 02:28:42.867]  Kimberly Clark's Block-It fabrics got you covered.
[02:28:43.147 --> 02:28:44.928]  That's Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:28:45.448 --> 02:28:50.934]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:28:51.375 --> 02:28:55.600]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:28:56.020 --> 02:29:02.888]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:29:03.328 --> 02:29:10.032]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:29:10.352 --> 02:29:11.953]  There are no reported side effects.
[02:29:12.253 --> 02:29:15.455]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:29:15.715 --> 02:29:18.176]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[02:29:18.477 --> 02:29:25.260]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:29:25.661 --> 02:29:28.362]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:29:28.602 --> 02:29:31.424]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll-free.
[02:29:31.764 --> 02:29:31.964]  At 866-885-6625.
[02:29:32.024 --> 02:29:32.385]  That's 866-885-6625.
[02:29:32.425 --> 02:29:35.428]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[02:29:35.608 --> 02:29:39.873]  Babies spend up to 15 hours a day sleeping and playing on a crib mattress.
[02:29:51.161 --> 02:29:55.547]  Standard baby mattresses are suspected of containing potentially harmful chemicals.
[02:29:56.087 --> 02:30:02.616]  The primary ingredient in most mattresses is polyurethane foam, a highly flammable petroleum product.
[02:30:03.016 --> 02:30:07.422]  At Naturepedic, we believe that your baby's health and safety are not negotiable.
[02:30:07.802 --> 02:30:12.745]  An organic cotton mattress is the first step toward a healthy and natural crib environment.
[02:30:13.046 --> 02:30:23.393]  At Naturepedic, the no-compromise organic baby crib mattress features organic cotton filling and a waterproof surface so pure that it meets food contact standards.
[02:30:23.833 --> 02:30:29.957]  A Naturepedic mattress provides a healthy sleep environment for your baby and a peace of mind for you.
[02:30:30.317 --> 02:30:31.998]  Go to Naturepedic.com.
[02:30:32.298 --> 02:30:34.580]  That's Naturepedic.com.
[02:30:35.020 --> 02:30:35.761]  Or call 1-800-91-PEDIC.
[02:30:37.962 --> 02:30:39.624]  That's 1-800-9-1-P-E-D-I-C.
[02:30:42.486 --> 02:30:43.207]  Call today.
[02:30:44.888 --> 02:30:45.829]  Thank you for being here.
[02:30:46.189 --> 02:30:54.857]  The book is called The World Without Us, and it is a scientific look at what would happen if we disappeared.
[02:30:55.577 --> 02:30:55.898]  People.
[02:30:56.698 --> 02:30:56.858]  Mm-hmm.
[02:30:57.219 --> 02:30:57.639]  That's it.
[02:31:00.361 --> 02:31:01.402]  Of course, a hypothetical.
[02:31:01.442 --> 02:31:02.423]  This is a hypothetical.
[02:31:03.464 --> 02:31:04.405]  It's a hypothetical.
[02:31:05.057 --> 02:31:11.662]  The problem with a lot of environmental writing these days is that a lot of people don't want to read it because they're all scared that we're going to die.
[02:31:12.483 --> 02:31:14.404]  So I killed everybody off in the first couple pages.
[02:31:16.626 --> 02:31:18.968]  But we get to stick around and see what the future looks like.
[02:31:19.528 --> 02:31:22.551]  And that seems to disarm the fear factor.
[02:31:23.111 --> 02:31:28.896]  What's amazing to me is how quickly everything we've built is reclaimed.
[02:31:30.357 --> 02:31:33.399]  A lot of stuff goes down rather fast.
[02:31:35.177 --> 02:31:36.397]  Our big infrastructure.
[02:31:36.537 --> 02:31:39.118]  Cities will start to crumble faster than we would imagine.
[02:31:40.299 --> 02:31:42.139]  This city is a really good example.
[02:31:42.179 --> 02:31:51.362]  The subways, as we already know, would flood in New York rather quickly.
[02:31:51.422 --> 02:31:53.003]  And he says everybody needs to die.
[02:31:53.023 --> 02:31:57.864]  And that's exactly what the elite are pushing.
[02:31:57.884 --> 02:32:00.245]  It's their excuse to kill us, do whatever they want with us.
[02:32:00.625 --> 02:32:01.985]  And I'm telling you, they're planning it.
[02:32:02.426 --> 02:32:03.386]  Endgame proves it.
[02:32:05.333 --> 02:32:28.131]  Now I had him up a month ago and I invited him back on today because you know I told you get precious metals and I told you this oh six seven years ago and you doubled your money I'm telling you now folks get into them I'm telling you have firearms I'm telling you if you can't live in a rural area at least buy a few acres somewhere so you can get a retreat out to it I don't care if it's a shack or a tent
[02:32:28.914 --> 02:32:31.315]  But the biggest thing is water and food.
[02:32:31.796 --> 02:32:35.117]  And Steve Schenck's got you covered on all of those fronts.
[02:32:35.197 --> 02:32:36.738]  It's the J. Michael Stevens Group.
[02:32:36.758 --> 02:32:38.859]  26 plus years in operation.
[02:32:38.879 --> 02:32:42.441]  The longest continually operating prepared and storable foods company.
[02:32:42.901 --> 02:32:45.082]  I bought food from them years and years ago.
[02:32:45.142 --> 02:32:46.723]  I just got food from them again.
[02:32:48.104 --> 02:32:50.205]  My staff has been buying food from them.
[02:32:50.265 --> 02:32:52.086]  They've got a great two month package.
[02:32:53.230 --> 02:32:55.372]  For one person that everyone must have.
[02:32:55.412 --> 02:32:57.033]  I mean, you don't care if you don't have any money.
[02:32:57.313 --> 02:32:58.393]  This is very inexpensive.
[02:32:58.454 --> 02:32:59.354]  This is the basics.
[02:32:59.694 --> 02:33:00.395]  You've got to have it.
[02:33:00.435 --> 02:33:04.157]  It could supplement other food and you could survive four months with it if you had some supplements.
[02:33:04.617 --> 02:33:08.520]  The meals are all about half, again, bigger than they need to be.
[02:33:08.940 --> 02:33:10.161]  They're high quality.
[02:33:10.781 --> 02:33:12.502]  We found the big sponsor.
[02:33:12.562 --> 02:33:13.723]  We found the good sponsor.
[02:33:13.763 --> 02:33:15.044]  We bring you the good folks.
[02:33:15.764 --> 02:33:21.168]  And I'm telling you that I believe passionately in this and it's a hedge.
[02:33:22.333 --> 02:33:24.074]  I'm not saying all these bad things are going to happen.
[02:33:24.354 --> 02:33:25.494]  The government, the media are.
[02:33:26.055 --> 02:33:26.775]  But I know this.
[02:33:27.175 --> 02:33:30.276]  If something does bad happen, I am prepared to take care of my family.
[02:33:30.616 --> 02:33:31.797]  It's insurance you can eat.
[02:33:31.897 --> 02:33:33.197]  It's insurance that you need.
[02:33:33.938 --> 02:33:37.819]  It's insurance that is guaranteed to pay off because you can use it one way or the other.
[02:33:37.919 --> 02:33:41.581]  It lasts more than 10 years when stored properly.
[02:33:43.021 --> 02:33:44.662]  But even in your attic, it'll last 10 years.
[02:33:44.702 --> 02:33:45.502]  And that's where I got mine.
[02:33:48.135 --> 02:33:48.776]  I just had some food.
[02:33:48.816 --> 02:33:50.037]  I'd be about 5 or 6 years old.
[02:33:50.077 --> 02:33:51.399]  Still good for 4 or 5 more years.
[02:33:51.459 --> 02:33:52.360]  I gave it to family.
[02:33:54.625 --> 02:34:02.192]  Listen, I don't know how to tell you how important this call is, and they've got great catalogs, great material, great information.
[02:34:02.232 --> 02:34:04.334]  They've got experts that'll talk to you.
[02:34:04.354 --> 02:34:11.861]  If you go to PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, you can see the big banner there at the top, so that makes it easy for web folks to get there.
[02:34:11.901 --> 02:34:15.464]  It's eFoodsDirect.com, just the letter E in FoodsDirect.com.
[02:34:15.805 --> 02:34:17.646]  But Steve Shank is the man behind it there, 26 years.
[02:34:18.827 --> 02:34:26.034]  And he's got the name and quality, the name and delivery, the name and dependability, and we're just honored to have high quality sponsors like this.
[02:34:26.334 --> 02:34:27.455]  Steve, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:34:27.956 --> 02:34:29.457]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:34:29.537 --> 02:34:42.590]  It's just absolutely a delight every time we match up because you're just carrying the spirit out there and leading the thrust to help people understand that this thing is absolutely serious.
[02:34:44.771 --> 02:34:49.953]  This is not a marketing ploy to get people scared like Y2K turned out to be for many organizations.
[02:34:50.813 --> 02:34:57.995]  What we're dealing with, we had another thing happen just this last week.
[02:34:58.695 --> 02:35:04.396]  It seems like every single week we've got a recall on meat from Oregon.
[02:35:04.456 --> 02:35:08.557]  We've got sandals that the Chinese are shipping over here.
[02:35:09.097 --> 02:35:11.458]  It's getting to the point, on my radio program,
[02:35:12.415 --> 02:35:33.744]  We're just about every time I lead off, Alex, I'm telling people, remember back four years ago when we here, between you and I, we've been telling people that at some point in time, and back then four years ago, we said in the near future, if you didn't grow it yourself, or if you didn't store it before it was contaminated, you wouldn't dare eat it.
[02:35:34.104 --> 02:35:34.905]  We are there!
[02:35:36.828 --> 02:35:46.136]  The stuff that's in the grocery stores with the genetic alterations and things that will make you glow in the dark, walk sideways, and one eye travel to the other side of your head are absolutely right there.
[02:35:47.157 --> 02:36:02.409]  And so what we're telling people, I have people call me all the time and say, well, we're hearing you counsel us to get any equity out of any property that we have before everything goes down and all real estate goes to pot.
[02:36:03.350 --> 02:36:05.392]  And they're talking about having that happen.
[02:36:06.309 --> 02:36:08.391]  But what should we do with it?
[02:36:08.411 --> 02:36:09.592]  Should we put in gold and silver?
[02:36:09.632 --> 02:36:10.273]  I say, yeah.
[02:36:10.633 --> 02:36:18.780]  But before you do that, get in your five or seven or three or four or whatever your conscience allows of food, because that's going to disappear.
[02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:21.662]  That's going to disappear before anything else does.
[02:36:21.822 --> 02:36:28.929]  Alex, right now, the last time we talked was probably about a month, maybe a month and a half ago.
[02:36:28.949 --> 02:36:31.231]  Food prices have gone up 10% in the last month. 10%?
[02:36:33.487 --> 02:36:38.150]  Hey, let me tell you, don't worry about the food that you buy in the grocery store.
[02:36:38.491 --> 02:36:39.792]  That's just the result.
[02:36:40.572 --> 02:36:42.654]  Look at the cattle feed.
[02:36:43.254 --> 02:36:52.261]  They are burning up so much of the corn, which is the basic cattle feed in this country, that we just about lost all dairy products three weeks ago.
[02:36:52.901 --> 02:36:54.142]  Just about lost all of them.
[02:36:54.682 --> 02:36:55.403]  They went from
[02:36:56.825 --> 02:37:02.988]  50 bucks for a 50 pound bag of the powdered milk that we have a can for the food supplies.
[02:37:03.649 --> 02:37:10.252]  It went from 50 bucks a bag up to $144 a bag and you couldn't buy it at that price.
[02:37:10.272 --> 02:37:20.697]  Now, the fact that it goes up in price is not significant because people will come up with whatever they have to.
[02:37:20.757 --> 02:37:22.238]  It's food, for crying out loud.
[02:37:23.083 --> 02:37:26.227]  But the fact that you can't get it, that's the real key.
[02:37:39.500 --> 02:37:50.603]  We've got our suppliers right now going out putting together additional canning operations, but the people are responding and you folks out there are calling us.
[02:37:50.643 --> 02:38:01.146]  You're getting in touch with us either at 800-409-5633 or on the web like Alex is telling you to do, but the fact is the orders are coming in like crazy.
[02:38:01.186 --> 02:38:04.467]  We're covered up with that, but the main thing that we're stressed over
[02:38:05.234 --> 02:38:09.338]  Is being able to get the food for you to have your shipments come out there.
[02:38:10.219 --> 02:38:29.117]  And so, my counsel, and this is not self-serving, let me tell you this Alex, whatever, I've got investors running around putting together funds to try and buy in raw materials into the warehouse in terms of millions of dollars worth.
[02:38:30.029 --> 02:38:32.011]  There is no end like there was in 1999.
[02:38:32.231 --> 02:38:34.173]  There's no other side to this.
[02:38:34.754 --> 02:38:42.561]  Whatever food that we can get into those warehouses while we can still get it, not necessarily afford it, but get it, that will go.
[02:38:42.581 --> 02:38:47.286]  So it's not a question, folks, of whether we're going to ship everything we can get our hands on.
[02:38:48.186 --> 02:38:56.094]  It's the question of you getting your tail in gear and getting some orders in so we can get them out there while we still have food.
[02:38:56.174 --> 02:38:57.916]  That's the bottom line, Alex.
[02:39:06.804 --> 02:39:13.929]  Plumbing, and your house, and cold weather gear, and wood-burning stoves, and gardening.
[02:39:13.969 --> 02:39:29.860]  I mean, I listen to the show almost every weekend because it's on Genesis when I'm driving into KLBJ to do my Sunday show, and so I can hear it on 100.1, I can hear it on 90.1, the little FM's around here, and then doing a great job, and then I can, you know, go do my own show.
[02:39:29.900 --> 02:39:33.503]  So I listen to it almost every week, at least 30-40 minutes as I drive into work.
[02:39:33.983 --> 02:39:36.844]  And I learn stuff every week and I know quite a bit.
[02:39:37.164 --> 02:39:40.204]  Tell folks about the showtimes here on Genesis.
[02:39:41.084 --> 02:39:47.946]  Well, on Genesis, we're right the two hours right after your program on Sunday evening.
[02:39:48.086 --> 02:39:50.206]  So I guess the micros are looping you before.
[02:39:50.226 --> 02:39:52.047]  They're airing the show from the week before.
[02:39:52.207 --> 02:39:55.527]  Yeah, they're picking up the one before and looping it around.
[02:39:55.947 --> 02:39:59.188]  But the two hours right after you and we go out on the same
[02:39:59.768 --> 02:40:05.193]  No, no, it's excellent information, but Steve, let me just put it to the listeners this way.
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:26.842]  You're a great sponsor.
[02:40:26.902 --> 02:40:28.304]  You're an old name in this.
[02:40:28.665 --> 02:40:29.526]  It's high quality.
[02:40:29.746 --> 02:40:32.050]  I go out and get the sponsors where I choose to buy stuff.
[02:40:32.511 --> 02:40:35.175]  I've chosen twice to get materials of foods through you.
[02:40:36.298 --> 02:40:41.382]  And whatever happens, they say the economy could implode, World War III could start, all these reasons.
[02:40:41.442 --> 02:40:43.004]  I mean, I'm worried about it.
[02:40:43.264 --> 02:40:43.724]  I have it.
[02:40:44.265 --> 02:40:49.870]  And I'm just telling you, listeners, that you can get food much less expensively through Steve Schenck.
[02:40:50.230 --> 02:40:53.733]  You can get prepared, and you just really need to do it.
[02:40:53.833 --> 02:40:57.656]  And when I opened up the newspaper and it says in one month food prices went up 10%,
[02:40:59.197 --> 02:41:04.880]  Because the dollar has been devalued by more than 50%, almost 60% in the last six years.
[02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:07.461]  Now, people are just learning about that.
[02:41:07.861 --> 02:41:10.463]  There have been supply problems, but let's say none of that happens.
[02:41:10.743 --> 02:41:12.224]  Then you've got the economy problems.
[02:41:12.244 --> 02:41:12.884]  You've got all of it.
[02:41:13.144 --> 02:41:14.745]  Bottom line, it lasts 10 years.
[02:41:15.085 --> 02:41:17.806]  Bottom line, you get it, and then you're not worried anymore.
[02:41:18.286 --> 02:41:21.288]  I'm trying to get people to be empowered, and I'm telling you.
[02:41:22.256 --> 02:41:30.954]  It feels good to have a gun safe you can get in in five seconds that's got a semi-automatic rifle with a 30-round clip and a shotgun and a handgun to defend your family.
[02:41:31.475 --> 02:41:31.976]  It feels good!
[02:41:33.228 --> 02:41:34.289]  We've had a little bit of gold.
[02:41:34.989 --> 02:41:36.730]  So if everything goes to pot, you'll be able to barter.
[02:41:36.870 --> 02:41:39.572]  It feels good to have an attic full of food.
[02:41:40.252 --> 02:41:47.877]  It feels good to be able to have a little, you know, I've got four acres outside town by Johnson City I can run to.
[02:41:47.897 --> 02:41:51.059]  And then I've got other family land in East Texas if I can make it that far.
[02:41:51.079 --> 02:41:54.881]  I mean, if Marshall Lobb, Total Clampdown, I can get out of here.
[02:41:54.901 --> 02:41:56.902]  And I've got a map in the car with the back roads.
[02:41:57.122 --> 02:42:01.866]  And it's four-wheel drive, and I got a shotgun rifle and a four-wheel drive, and I can skin a buck, folks.
[02:42:02.107 --> 02:42:03.208]  I can run a trot line.
[02:42:03.588 --> 02:42:11.395]  And I'm telling you, if you don't know how to skin a buck and run a trot line, just in case, I mean, if it's even a 10% chance, you need to be prepared.
[02:42:11.735 --> 02:42:13.597]  Bottom line, Steve, give them your number.
[02:42:13.797 --> 02:42:14.197]  800-409-5633.
[02:42:14.257 --> 02:42:14.458]  That's 800-409-5633.
[02:42:14.478 --> 02:42:20.082]  And we're taking a lot of calls right now, Alex, so they will probably talk to one of our operators.
[02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:32.842]  Just give them the information and we'll get back to you.
[02:42:33.022 --> 02:42:42.126]  We'll fill out any needs that you have in terms of... Yeah, you guys are great because you love to talk and even if you call them back two days later, you'll spend a lot of time with them.
[02:42:42.146 --> 02:42:45.108]  A lot of times you're talking to Steve or the great ladies in his office.
[02:42:45.348 --> 02:42:46.649]  Give them that number out slowly.
[02:42:46.669 --> 02:42:46.709]  1-800-409.
[02:42:51.775 --> 02:42:53.996]  Five, six, three, three.
[02:43:11.448 --> 02:43:14.590]  Okay, and so I'm not out buying shiny things with Steve's sponsorship.
[02:43:14.610 --> 02:43:15.190]  You know what I did?
[02:43:15.650 --> 02:43:25.315]  I signed a contract, it's a two-year when they make you do that, for the biggest, best company out there for video and audio distribution and delivery.
[02:43:25.355 --> 02:43:29.097]  So my information will be on hundreds of servers, very hard to bring down.
[02:43:29.517 --> 02:43:31.838]  We're going to the next level thanks to Steve's help.
[02:43:32.199 --> 02:43:34.840]  So literally, with his sponsorship,
[02:43:35.320 --> 02:43:36.801]  Which then, of course, we believe in.
[02:43:36.841 --> 02:43:38.022]  So it's a win-win-win.
[02:43:38.382 --> 02:43:49.548]  We are going to bring you even better video at PrisonPlanet.tv and with all the free audio and video we put out as well because we want to give you the best medium available.
[02:43:49.588 --> 02:43:52.250]  So again, Steve is also supporting this broadcast.
[02:43:52.470 --> 02:43:55.912]  Tell them about that two-month supply because I know some people here at my office got that
[02:43:56.352 --> 02:43:58.952]  And I even have a couple of the two-month supplies here at the office.
[02:43:59.673 --> 02:44:06.554]  How do people, and we've got the Berkeys in there and everything else, how do people, and you've also got a preparedness kit you've got, how do people get that two-month supply?
[02:44:07.094 --> 02:44:15.835]  All they do is either call 800-409-5633 or go up on the web, efoodsdirect.com and... What do you call that?
[02:44:15.875 --> 02:44:17.176]  What do you call that two-month supply?
[02:44:17.716 --> 02:44:18.396]  I don't have it in front of me.
[02:44:18.416 --> 02:44:20.396]  I mean, that's a lot of food in those two little boxes.
[02:44:20.636 --> 02:44:21.716]  Well, yeah, you've got two cases.
[02:44:21.776 --> 02:44:22.937]  It's got 200 meals in it.
[02:44:25.669 --> 02:44:29.690]  It's a two-month supply, and it runs for $3.49.
[02:44:30.851 --> 02:44:43.555]  Generally, we don't quote prices on the air just because we don't want to make it sound like we're hucking food, but I'm telling you folks, this thing comes out to roughly $1.73 a meal, and these are 150% meals, and the reason we put that out, Alex,
[02:44:49.222 --> 02:44:52.904]  Is that your regular food supplies, you need food that you cook with you normally.
[02:44:53.304 --> 02:44:54.965]  With this, you can grab and run with it.
[02:44:55.005 --> 02:45:02.289]  You can send it to a student, disabled veterans and elderly people are using this because all you do is add water and cook it and it's ready to run.
[02:45:02.329 --> 02:45:03.270]  And these are high quality.
[02:45:03.310 --> 02:45:04.410]  We've tested them.
[02:45:04.450 --> 02:45:05.091]  We've eaten them.
[02:45:05.331 --> 02:45:07.372]  It's even better quality than what I got from you years ago.
[02:45:07.392 --> 02:45:08.692]  And that was high quality.
[02:45:09.073 --> 02:45:10.433]  And this blows MREs away.
[02:45:10.493 --> 02:45:12.975]  All you need really is a little
[02:45:14.915 --> 02:45:21.257]  Well, what we've got, what we've put together is what we call an accessory kit.
[02:45:21.737 --> 02:45:38.502]  It has a water purifier, a portable water purifier, so you've got the water, and then you just get some little LP fuel cells, and it's got a stove in it, and anybody that picks up three of these, we just send it to them, or they can pick up the accessory kit for their
[02:45:39.660 --> 02:45:53.949]  For their two-month supply, for about $96, but anything that you get through the J. Michael Stevens Group or the task force here, you're going to end up with more of a better quality for less money than anything else you can do out there.
[02:45:53.989 --> 02:45:55.270]  We just absolutely guarantee it.
[02:45:55.290 --> 02:45:57.031]  Well, that's why you've been around 26 years.
[02:45:57.111 --> 02:45:59.853]  It's a very competitive market out there, and that's why you're number one.
[02:45:59.933 --> 02:46:01.414]  Give them the number slowly.
[02:46:01.434 --> 02:46:01.494]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:46:11.113 --> 02:46:16.437]  1-800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[02:46:17.577 --> 02:46:23.221]  I'll tell you right now, it's the good feeling of knowing I'm prepared.
[02:46:24.342 --> 02:46:33.687]  It's the feeling of, if the New World Order decides to go to martial law, nuke cities, start their extermination operations, or if there's a depression, whatever happens.
[02:46:34.208 --> 02:46:36.749]  I've got a couple years food supply for my entire family.
[02:46:37.470 --> 02:46:38.650]  And that doesn't mean I'm 100% secure.
[02:46:40.406 --> 02:46:41.847]  Uh, but it means I'm a lot more secure.
[02:46:41.867 --> 02:46:44.648]  Can you imagine these yuppies that have got a week of food in their refrigerator?
[02:46:44.928 --> 02:46:47.549]  And when there's a little hurricane, there's no food in 24 hours.
[02:46:47.829 --> 02:46:50.430]  Can you imagine them, Steve, in a Great Depression situation?
[02:46:50.650 --> 02:46:52.591]  Back then, 80% of people lived in the country.
[02:46:52.811 --> 02:46:54.091]  People in the city had gardens.
[02:46:54.111 --> 02:46:55.052]  People weren't criminals.
[02:46:55.292 --> 02:46:58.233]  Can you imagine how things will unravel if things fall apart here now?
[02:46:58.573 --> 02:46:59.633]  It'll be complete bad luck!
[02:46:59.893 --> 02:47:03.855]  I'll tell you what, one of the things with families, one of the objectives that we have, Alex,
[02:47:04.675 --> 02:47:05.336]  We're good to go.
[02:47:35.297 --> 02:47:40.222]  And that was when there were only 30% of the jobs lost as a result of the depression.
[02:47:40.542 --> 02:47:44.746]  And that was when still 80% of the population was tied to the family farm.
[02:47:45.386 --> 02:47:50.491]  Right now we have less than 1% of the families tied to any kind of farming at all.
[02:47:51.184 --> 02:47:54.925]  People are living in these urban areas, and they have no food.
[02:47:54.985 --> 02:47:56.466]  They even shop.
[02:47:56.866 --> 02:48:00.567]  They shop sometimes every other day for the meals they need.
[02:48:00.587 --> 02:48:02.328]  They have nothing in their home to reserve.
[02:48:02.588 --> 02:48:07.590]  They can get a two-month supply, which is the bare minimum, and then throw it under the bed for that day they may need it.
[02:48:07.890 --> 02:48:10.891]  Or five, six years down the road, oh, nothing ever happened.
[02:48:10.911 --> 02:48:11.711]  Thank God.
[02:48:11.791 --> 02:48:12.711]  I hope that's the case.
[02:48:12.771 --> 02:48:13.592]  Believe me, folks.
[02:48:13.632 --> 02:48:14.352]  I like my life.
[02:48:14.412 --> 02:48:20.414]  And going to the shop, and going to a movie every few weeks, and going to dinner and eating enchiladas, I don't... Believe me.
[02:48:21.054 --> 02:48:30.456]  But there's a good chance things could unravel, and you're nuts if you don't know how to use a gun, too.
[02:48:30.476 --> 02:48:31.477]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:48:31.817 --> 02:48:32.237]  Stay there.
[02:48:32.257 --> 02:48:38.778]  I've got a few more questions for our guest, Steve Schenck, J. Michael Stevens Group, eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:48:39.338 --> 02:48:41.259]  I'm Alex Jones, and I hope you get prepared.
[02:48:48.445 --> 02:48:51.648]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:51.988 --> 02:48:53.930]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.290 --> 02:49:01.917]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.634 --> 02:49:09.677]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.077 --> 02:49:21.502]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.802 --> 02:49:25.504]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.764 --> 02:49:27.685]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.045 --> 02:49:31.887]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:45.567 --> 02:49:50.529]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:49:50.849 --> 02:49:56.271]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.

[02:50:04.274 --> 02:50:07.695]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:50:08.035 --> 02:50:17.380]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:21.142]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:50:21.382 --> 02:50:28.486]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:50:45.462 --> 02:50:47.704]  Oh, those summer nights and those summer electric bills.
[02:50:47.904 --> 02:50:51.227]  How would you like to save money this summer on your electric bill and sleep better than ever?
[02:50:51.447 --> 02:50:54.049]  Well, now you can with the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[02:50:54.169 --> 02:50:57.752]  The BedFan will allow you to raise your thermostat several degrees and still sleep cool.
[02:50:58.012 --> 02:51:02.596]  This works by delivering a gentle breeze between your sheets, thus keeping your body cool and comfortable.
[02:51:02.896 --> 02:51:04.237]  Doug from Austin, Texas writes,
[02:51:04.617 --> 02:51:06.360]  I like it to be very cold while sleeping.
[02:51:06.420 --> 02:51:12.408]  Since purchasing the BedFan, I've been able to turn the thermostat up from 68 to 78 degrees, and I've never been more comfortable.
[02:51:12.588 --> 02:51:16.553]  My electric bill this month compared to the same month last year is over 27% lower.
[02:51:16.733 --> 02:51:18.175]  I couldn't be happier with your product.
[02:51:18.416 --> 02:51:21.720]  Maybe it is time you started thinking about trying the BedFan Personal Cooling System.

[02:51:23.440 --> 02:51:25.601]  If you want to lower your electric bill, you will love it too.

[02:51:56.724 --> 02:51:58.145]  Is it getting better?
[02:52:01.587 --> 02:52:06.070]  Or do you feel the same?
[02:52:06.910 --> 02:52:09.332]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[02:52:10.553 --> 02:52:17.317]  You've got someone to blame You said one love
[02:52:19.091 --> 02:52:25.940]  You know, it's hard to cut off man in black, Johnny Cash.
[02:52:26.841 --> 02:52:34.570]  Oh, it leaves you, baby, if you don't care about it.
[02:52:35.752 --> 02:52:37.314]  Alright, we're back live here, folks.
[02:52:39.327 --> 02:52:40.968]  Look, I love getting our listeners prepared.
[02:52:40.988 --> 02:52:45.271]  I was just talking to Steve Shanker in the break and I said, man, that's all going to, you know what, in a hand basket.
[02:52:45.291 --> 02:52:51.375]  He said, yeah, but the more people we've got prepared, the more people we've got to put it back in place after things degenerate.
[02:52:51.855 --> 02:52:52.376]  And that's true.
[02:52:52.416 --> 02:52:55.378]  It's my job to take care of my wife, my children, and my family.
[02:52:56.038 --> 02:53:00.221]  And if my family won't buy water filters, I buy them and I go over and harangue them and try to make them use them.
[02:53:00.862 --> 02:53:02.843]  And I try to buy family storable foods.
[02:53:02.903 --> 02:53:06.284]  I mean, that's what I do around here with my disposable income.
[02:53:06.885 --> 02:53:08.906]  Because that's what you're supposed to do is be a provider.
[02:53:08.946 --> 02:53:10.446]  It was normal 50 years ago.
[02:53:10.967 --> 02:53:12.047]  Now it's not normal.
[02:53:12.767 --> 02:53:14.488]  Well, I'm trying to get us back to what we were.
[02:53:14.928 --> 02:53:17.670]  And the new order won't make a play for us if we're prepared.
[02:53:17.710 --> 02:53:18.370]  That's another thing.
[02:53:19.190 --> 02:53:19.650]  Believe me.
[02:53:20.511 --> 02:53:25.173]  And by the way, the last year, the SWAT teams, the sheriff's departments, they've all been getting storable foods and getting ready.
[02:53:26.090 --> 02:53:27.872]  They're all gonna hoard it during an emergency.
[02:53:28.353 --> 02:53:30.976]  Steve, bottom line, they need to give you a call.
[02:53:32.397 --> 02:53:32.958]  How do they do it?
[02:53:33.879 --> 02:53:34.340]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:53:37.919 --> 02:53:42.563]  And the whole objective, Alex, is the more people we can make bulletproof.
[02:53:42.663 --> 02:53:44.585]  I'm not talking about bullet-like bullets.
[02:53:45.006 --> 02:54:03.182]  I'm talking about when the dollar crashes and it will, and when the economy goes to pot, our people that are prepared can truly be fearless, because if they are not dependent for food, if they're not dependent, if they get themselves healthy, if they're not dependent and get out of debt,
[02:54:04.093 --> 02:54:15.798]  Then, the only thing that can control us, the only thing that can have power over us, if we become dependent on someone or something, then we give them power to control us.
[02:54:15.938 --> 02:54:17.919]  And so, independence is the answer.
[02:54:17.939 --> 02:54:21.500]  That's what the old-timers always did, and that's what we need to do.
[02:54:21.520 --> 02:54:22.181]  Absolutely.
[02:54:22.521 --> 02:54:23.061]  Absolutely.
[02:54:23.081 --> 02:54:27.783]  Steve Shank will talk to you again, hopefully next month, and everybody can visit you at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:54:27.803 --> 02:54:28.684]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:54:29.064 --> 02:54:29.604]  Take care, buddy.
[02:54:30.217 --> 02:54:35.801]  Steve Shank is a wonderful person and great products and frankly I hope the dollar doesn't crash.
[02:54:35.861 --> 02:54:38.423]  It's already been hurt pretty bad and I hope none of this stuff happens.
[02:54:38.883 --> 02:54:42.966]  But there's a good chance and all I know is common sense.
[02:54:43.447 --> 02:54:44.527]  They use food as a weapon.
[02:54:44.547 --> 02:54:48.190]  I got State Department Memorandum 200 and you need to give them a call.
[02:54:48.470 --> 02:54:50.492]  And I was thinking also it's good to have vitamins.
[02:54:50.552 --> 02:54:53.173]  It's good to be able to have a supplement too during these emergencies.
[02:54:53.634 --> 02:54:57.997]  And a great thing to supplement your eFoods direct packages is the inner food.
[02:54:58.437 --> 02:55:03.341]  If you go to PrisonPlanet.com and link through to their site, you get 10% off and 20% off on bulk orders.

[02:55:30.782 --> 02:55:31.462]  I'm out of time.
[02:55:32.622 --> 02:55:35.643]  And, again, we could not do this show without the sponsors.
[02:55:35.683 --> 02:55:37.444]  We could not do it without the AMF affiliates.
[02:55:37.744 --> 02:55:40.925]  We could not do it without the listeners who support us and support the sponsors.
[02:55:41.225 --> 02:55:43.686]  So I thank all of you for your support out there.
[02:55:43.706 --> 02:55:45.327]  And I thank you for your prayers.
[02:55:46.307 --> 02:55:50.789]  And I hope to see you in this historical resistance to tyranny in New York.
[02:55:50.849 --> 02:55:51.529]  I'm going to be there.
[02:55:52.759 --> 02:55:58.445]  And I just pray that God will move the hearts of those cops to realize they're killing America when they try to violate the First Amendment.
[02:55:59.025 --> 02:56:01.928]  And I want to see everybody out there at the CFR at 4 o'clock this afternoon.
[02:56:01.968 --> 02:56:02.469]  I won't be there.
[02:56:02.489 --> 02:56:03.169]  I've been there before.
[02:56:03.670 --> 02:56:05.912]  But I'll see you tomorrow night in New York City, God willing.
[02:56:06.152 --> 02:56:07.914]  Pray for safe travel there for me and my crew.
[02:56:09.253 --> 02:56:13.076]  At around 7, 8 o'clock, whenever we can get there, Times Square at the recruiting office.
[02:56:13.476 --> 02:56:14.317]  So pray for us, folks.
[02:56:14.497 --> 02:56:15.298]  We'll be praying for you.
[02:56:15.318 --> 02:56:21.222]  Alright, I want to thank the Genesis Network as well, John Harmer for running the show, Craig NK for producing, and everybody else out there.
[02:56:21.262 --> 02:56:23.344]  God bless you all, I'll see you in New York!
