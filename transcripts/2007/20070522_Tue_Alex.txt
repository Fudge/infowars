[00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:06.099]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.801]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:09.662]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:11.123]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.863 --> 00:00:12.784]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:17.046]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.606 --> 00:00:21.769]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.512 --> 00:00:30.694]  Got a big broadcast for you today, Aaron Russo.
[00:00:31.775 --> 00:00:34.757]  He'll be joining us for the full third hour today.
[00:00:37.523 --> 00:00:38.604]  I don't want to wear him out.
[00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:42.647]  He is battling cancer now and needs our prayers.
[00:00:42.687 --> 00:00:44.169]  But he wants to come on.
[00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:45.109]  We want to have him on.
[00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.010]  Good friend of mine.
[00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.752]  Great mind against the New World Order.
[00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:48.492]  A great soul.
[00:00:48.512 --> 00:00:49.873]  A good person.
[00:00:49.893 --> 00:01:02.224]  He'll be joining us to talk about the Ron Paul campaign, the New World Order, the North American Union, the IRS, the collection agency, the private run for profit, Federal Reserve.
[00:01:02.264 --> 00:01:03.765]  That is in the third hour today.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.066]  Coming up in the second hour in studio, Bob Dacey is going to be joining us.
[00:01:12.246 --> 00:01:15.890]  Bob Dacey writes for the New American Magazine.
[00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:16.811]  He's a good friend of mine.
[00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:19.213]  I've known him for about, I don't know, 7, 8, 9, 10 years.
[00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:20.514]  I guess it's about 98.
[00:01:22.156 --> 00:01:25.018]  And he hosts a local TV show for 5 or 6 years.
[00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.763]  And he'll be breaking down the North American Union because
[00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:37.134]  And I'm going to cover this before he even joins us, and then dovetail it with his analysis.
[00:01:38.595 --> 00:01:40.296]  The story that was written by the St.
[00:01:40.336 --> 00:01:53.201]  Louis Post-Dispatch and carried by hundreds of newspapers across the country, syndicated by McClatchy, Urban Legend of North American Union Feeds on Fears.
[00:01:54.202 --> 00:01:55.442]  And this is the mantra.
[00:01:55.462 --> 00:01:56.683]  There have been literally
[00:01:57.768 --> 00:02:01.749]  Scores of articles written that have the term urban legend in their headline.
[00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:15.574]  They say there's no plan to get rid of the dollar, there's no plan to build superhighways for NAFTA, there is no security and prosperity partnership, there is no North American Union, there is no nothing!
[00:02:16.915 --> 00:02:23.077]  And so I thought we would spend the second hour on that today and dovetail it with the Council on Foreign Relations announcement.
[00:02:23.832 --> 00:02:50.008]  uh... from uh... two weeks ago the end of national currencies because according to uh... philip dine mcclatchy tribune there is no such thing and so i thought we would uh... go over that also we aired most of ron paul's speech that he gave this weekend here in austin texas but there's three or four minutes left of it we're going to air that coming up in the next segment
[00:02:50.618 --> 00:02:52.620]  Then I wanted to play a Fox News piece.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.682]  They have that new Sunday night comedy program.
[00:02:54.702 --> 00:02:57.204]  I don't think it's very funny what they were saying about 9-11.
[00:02:57.464 --> 00:02:58.365]  We'll play that.
[00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:12.376]  Also, they've got a shill on C-SPAN pushing their propaganda about how anybody who questions the government is basically a tinfoil hat brigade.
[00:03:12.397 --> 00:03:14.839]  So we'll be playing that.
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.662]  Also, we're going to go over
[00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:43.250]  The new paper that came out last week with Dr. Stephen Jones that Codified Research has been doing the last two years, and these new metal spheres they found, these globulates of molten metal that congealed and froze in the air and came to the ground, crystallizing and saving in an intact fashion.
[00:03:44.362 --> 00:03:44.963]  I think?
[00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.933]  PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com right now.
[00:04:08.953 --> 00:04:16.599]  911 debunkers hide, and they are hiding, from slam-dunk evidence of controlled demolition.
[00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.101]  And Professor Jones is joining us for a full hour tomorrow.
[00:04:20.862 --> 00:04:32.471]  Electron microscope analysis of steel spheres from WTC site proves thermate, proves collapse of Twin Towers was an act of deliberate arson.
[00:04:35.518 --> 00:04:36.919]  We'll also get into the U.S.
[00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:43.425]  Senate saying they're backing off for at least a few weeks on the amnesty bill.
[00:04:43.925 --> 00:04:52.332]  That means we're in even greater danger because they say they're going to introduce it out of the clear blue sky and try to sneak attack us.
[00:04:53.113 --> 00:04:55.375]  They'll probably start denying there was ever even a bill.
[00:04:56.175 --> 00:05:00.639]  And once they pass it, they'll deny they passed it or that police are wearing black masks.
[00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:09.811]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.191 --> 00:05:17.838]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.522 --> 00:05:25.566]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.987 --> 00:05:37.414]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.714 --> 00:05:41.176]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.676 --> 00:05:43.597]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.937 --> 00:05:47.780]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:05.458]  Hello folks Nick Begich here from the great fishing state of Alaska.
[00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:09.880]  Sometimes fishermen get a little upset when we throw back the biggest fish they've ever caught.
[00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:12.722]  We have to explain to them that you don't want to keep the babies.
[00:06:13.222 --> 00:06:18.465]  There's something else you don't want to keep and that's the parasites and pathogenic bacteria in the water.
[00:06:18.605 --> 00:06:21.327]  One drink from the wrong pool of water can ruin a great trip.
[00:06:21.767 --> 00:06:24.330]  That's why we recommend Berkey Light Water Purifiers.
[00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:32.517]  So powerful, they purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and ponds by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites.

[00:07:01.962 --> 00:07:04.504]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:13.071]  Did you know the syndicated columnist Charlie Reese once wrote a stinging indictment against the internationalists who have captured our federal government for their own purposes?
[00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:18.855]  He reported that the present government of the United States is systematically undoing our independence.
[00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:27.033]  He said that agreeing to belong to the World Trade Organization and taking orders from it was a deliberate sacrifice of our national sovereignty.
[00:07:27.874 --> 00:07:31.598]  He said the United Nations represents the same threat to our sovereignty.
[00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:35.702]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass.
[00:07:36.683 --> 00:07:41.608]  And offer you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.

[00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.050]  Call now.
[00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.872]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:08:01.242 --> 00:08:06.864]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:17.609]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:17.709 --> 00:08:18.389]  Welcome back.
[00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:20.090]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:34.985]  First off, let's finish up just the very end of Congressman Ron Paul's speech he gave here Saturday to an overflow crowd at a fundraiser in Austin, Texas.
[00:08:35.951 --> 00:08:41.974]  This is just the last couple minutes from that speech that we ran out of time attempting to air yesterday.
[00:08:41.994 --> 00:08:54.021]  We'll go ahead and roll that, and then I'm going to plunge into the latest war news in Lebanon, new 9-11 information that the debunkers are literally hiding from.
[00:08:54.041 --> 00:09:04.347]  Then we've got Bob Dacey joining us in studio in the next hour to talk about the North American Union and how the debunkers are denying it even exists, and of course Aaron Russo
[00:09:05.088 --> 00:09:07.035]  End of the third hour today.
[00:09:07.978 --> 00:09:09.684]  Right now, here is Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:09:13.328 --> 00:09:19.751]  I think what's happened in this country is we've lost respect for the rule of law, but we've lost respect and confidence in how liberty works.
[00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:34.279]  We're always frightened that if the government doesn't provide the safety net, there's going to be more poverty, no housing, and all the things that happened over the last several decades.
[00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:38.081]  But this is not necessary.
[00:09:38.181 --> 00:09:39.221]  It is so unnecessary.
[00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:40.562]  Freedom works!
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.285]  We have lost that confidence where we know and understand that it will work.
[00:09:45.826 --> 00:09:53.316]  But there is one admonition that John Adams gave, and he said, for freedom really to work, you have to have a moral society.
[00:09:59.074 --> 00:10:14.728]  So, we can come down very hard on our government, and I do, all three branches of the government, but quite frankly, even our candidacy here, if we're successful, it still requires an endorsement from the people.
[00:10:15.169 --> 00:10:16.991]  And that's where I have been reluctant.
[00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:19.433]  I did not know where the numbers would be.
[00:10:19.873 --> 00:10:21.953]  I did not know whether the money would be there.
[00:10:22.033 --> 00:10:26.954]  I did not understand the Internet, but I have been educated in the last few weeks.
[00:10:36.676 --> 00:10:45.358]  And we do know that truth wins out in the end, but I didn't know that there were so many so ready to receive the truth about what's going on in this country.
[00:10:55.398 --> 00:10:58.979]  But it truly gives me hope and that's what we need.
[00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:03.700]  We have lived and been blessed to live in a country that has been really great.
[00:11:04.281 --> 00:11:09.522]  We are fortunate that we have the founders that we did that understood what personal liberty was all about.
[00:11:09.542 --> 00:11:15.924]  They even understood what habeas corpus meant and unfortunately
[00:11:17.518 --> 00:11:26.826]  Unfortunately, we moved into this era where they're endorsing torture and getting rid of habeas corpus, warrantless searches, national ID cards.
[00:11:27.007 --> 00:11:29.369]  And I think the American people are catching on.
[00:11:29.489 --> 00:11:38.197]  You know, the national ID card was voted on overwhelmingly, but now do you know, I'll bet you do, that a lot of states are now condemning it, won't participate.
[00:11:38.237 --> 00:11:38.997]  They're waking up!
[00:11:50.652 --> 00:11:52.453]  You know, I don't know how this will end.
[00:11:52.534 --> 00:11:53.274]  That is the truth.
[00:11:53.354 --> 00:11:57.317]  I could come up here and say, I absolutely know how it's going to turn out.
[00:11:57.457 --> 00:12:01.401]  I don't know, and you don't know, but I do know that the message is good.
[00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:03.182]  The message of liberty is good.
[00:12:03.202 --> 00:12:04.463]  We've lived in a great country.
[00:12:04.583 --> 00:12:10.288]  We need to fall back on the traditions of our Constitution and the traditions of America.
[00:12:10.848 --> 00:12:12.149]  And we will do well.
[00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:18.294]  But I am quite confident now that the numbers are larger than I ever believed.
[00:12:18.394 --> 00:12:19.515]  I think we're moving in the right direction.
[00:12:31.145 --> 00:12:49.800]  Very, very reluctant at the beginning and you know in some ways I think that not being overly eager to be the president is not necessarily bad because I think too often they're overly eager and they shouldn't be there.
[00:12:52.109 --> 00:12:59.531]  All I can tell you is that it's moving faster and more furiously than I ever dreamed.
[00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:11.915]  I do promise that I will continue to deliver the message, I will continue to be as consistent as possible, and I will continue to stay in there as long as our numbers keep growing.
[00:13:11.935 --> 00:13:12.855]  Thank you very much!
[00:13:26.383 --> 00:13:30.447]  From right here in Texas, gave a Saturday night.
[00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:35.512]  Now, let me just go ahead and get these clips out of the way because they're important.
[00:13:35.553 --> 00:13:38.856]  This is the new propaganda comedy show they have on Fox.
[00:13:40.758 --> 00:13:49.687]  And they talk about the wildest conspiracy theory of them all, and it turns out that the wildest conspiracy theory of them all is the official story.
[00:13:50.934 --> 00:13:57.337]  So in a way they try to usurp our own little catchphrase here and turn it back around on us.
[00:13:59.738 --> 00:14:04.700]  And so here is a little snippet from the new Fox propaganda program.
[00:14:05.481 --> 00:14:09.322]  Tonight we introduce a new feature to the program, Conspiracy Corner.
[00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:12.524]  Please welcome our conspiracy analyst, Jack McCraney.
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.082]  Welcome to Conspiracy Corner.
[00:14:23.482 --> 00:14:24.844]  Tonight's topic, 9-11.
[00:14:24.944 --> 00:14:35.496]  Here to present his theory about what actually transpired that terrible day, actor, activist, father, singer, you got so many titles, Lorenzo Lamas.
[00:14:35.516 --> 00:14:36.637]  Thanks for being here, big guy.
[00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:39.400]  Thank you.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.241]  Thanks, Jack.
[00:14:40.361 --> 00:14:41.162]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[00:14:42.952 --> 00:14:46.497]  Now, I have to tell you folks, hold on to your seats.
[00:14:46.557 --> 00:14:53.666]  I've heard many imaginative theories during the course of my long career, but this one beats them all.
[00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:55.488]  You've been forewarned.
[00:14:55.909 --> 00:14:57.571]  Go on, Lorenzo, tell us about your theory.
[00:14:58.709 --> 00:15:10.995]  Well, Jack, it is my belief that the attacks on the World Trade Center were perpetrated by 19 Middle Eastern Muslims who hijacked four jets and flew them into the Trade Towers and the Pentagon.
[00:15:11.315 --> 00:15:12.436]  Whoa!
[00:15:13.056 --> 00:15:15.797]  Okay, let's back up there, big guy, okay?
[00:15:16.638 --> 00:15:18.358]  Walk us through this.
[00:15:19.359 --> 00:15:21.380]  These 19 Muslims know Dick Cheney.
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:21.680]  How?
[00:15:24.121 --> 00:15:24.481]  They don't.
[00:15:24.661 --> 00:15:25.762]  Dick Cheney wasn't involved.
[00:15:26.557 --> 00:15:27.038]  Okay.
[00:15:27.558 --> 00:15:30.942]  Dick Cheney, not involved in 9-11.
[00:15:31.282 --> 00:15:31.763]  Okay.
[00:15:32.243 --> 00:15:32.603]  Go on.
[00:15:34.105 --> 00:15:39.210]  Well, the 19 Muslims were acting as part of a conspiracy by the Al-Qaeda.
[00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:41.933]  Al-Qaeda, that's code for the Bush White House, correct?
[00:15:43.266 --> 00:15:45.607]  No, actually, it's a terrorist organization.
[00:15:45.867 --> 00:15:48.087]  Yes, we know the White House is a terrorist organization.
[00:15:48.947 --> 00:15:49.887]  No, no, Al-Qaeda.
[00:15:50.888 --> 00:15:53.048]  You're talking in circles here, Lorenzo.
[00:15:53.708 --> 00:15:54.528]  What are you saying?
[00:15:55.168 --> 00:15:59.169]  I'm saying Al-Qaeda planned and financed the attacks.
[00:15:59.849 --> 00:16:03.010]  Why would Jewish bankers bankroll Muslim terrorists?
[00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:06.971]  I seem to recall a little animosity between those two groups.
[00:16:08.291 --> 00:16:09.811]  Who said anything about Jewish bankers?
[00:16:09.931 --> 00:16:12.912]  I'm saying that Muslim terrorists destroyed the Trade Center.
[00:16:13.593 --> 00:16:20.097]  Okay, then please explain to me how jet planes can fly into the World Trade Towers causing steel buildings to collapse.
[00:16:21.278 --> 00:16:25.400]  Because the heat of the jet fuel caused the metal to melt and buckle.
[00:16:26.381 --> 00:16:29.903]  Are you trying to say fire, melt, steel?
[00:16:32.945 --> 00:16:34.246]  Uh, why yes, Jack.
[00:16:34.446 --> 00:16:35.727]  That's actually how they make steel.
[00:16:37.436 --> 00:16:39.879]  Oh, so they make steel.
[00:16:42.441 --> 00:16:45.204]  Lorenzo, you're a funny, funny man.
[00:16:46.044 --> 00:17:02.639]  Why don't you just admit you're trying to salvage your career with this pathetic and insane theory when the truth is 9-11 was obviously a vast conspiracy between Washington neocons and Jewish Zionists to justify Halliburton invading Iraq!
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.120]  Admit it!
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:07.244]  Admit it or I swear I'll hit you in the solar plexus so hard you'll squeal like a kitten!
[00:17:15.208 --> 00:17:16.089]  Come on, Lorenzo.
[00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.210]  Talk to me, man.
[00:17:21.432 --> 00:17:21.912]  You're right.
[00:17:22.113 --> 00:17:22.593]  I'm sorry.
[00:17:22.613 --> 00:17:23.333]  I'm so sorry.
[00:17:23.373 --> 00:17:23.774]  You're right.
[00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:25.455]  I made the whole thing up.
[00:17:25.475 --> 00:17:27.616]  It's okay, Lorenzo.
[00:17:27.656 --> 00:17:28.297]  It's okay.
[00:17:28.797 --> 00:17:34.020]  My publicist said that I had to make up some crazy 9-11 theory or do a sex tape with Star Jones.
[00:17:35.401 --> 00:17:36.922]  I couldn't do it.
[00:17:36.942 --> 00:17:37.683]  I understand.
[00:17:37.743 --> 00:17:39.804]  I mean, it's tough out there, brother.
[00:17:41.105 --> 00:17:42.146]  I'm so sorry.
[00:17:44.139 --> 00:17:44.659]  It's okay.
[00:17:44.899 --> 00:17:45.580]  It's okay.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.061]  Kurt, Jen, back to you.
[00:17:54.084 --> 00:18:13.133]  Okay, all you do is type into a search engine the process of making steel or how to make steel and it'll come up and it will explain that they have huge furnaces with bellows where they would inject hot air into huge
[00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:28.882]  Preparations of white hot charcoal and it wasn't until just what the last 175 years or so they learned how to make real steel and then structural steel in mass.
[00:18:28.902 --> 00:18:33.605]  Before it was all iron so it wasn't strong enough to make the type of tall buildings you see.
[00:18:33.625 --> 00:18:40.809]  You can go read about the whole history of that at major universities and engineering websites for yourself.
[00:18:44.497 --> 00:18:49.019]  Ladies and gentlemen, fire does not melt steel.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.482]  That is on the classical term, fire, the temperatures that you see in fire.
[00:18:55.583 --> 00:18:56.463]  Do not do that.
[00:18:57.344 --> 00:19:05.748]  It takes an acetylene torch turned on high a long time to even cut through a three or four inch piece of structural steel.
[00:19:06.848 --> 00:19:11.751]  And large steel columns, four foot around, are huge, amazing heat sinks.
[00:19:12.603 --> 00:19:18.127]  I mean, they absorb so much heat before they even begin to start going up in temperature.
[00:19:19.628 --> 00:19:21.289]  I wonder if I should just read.
[00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.271]  I've got a page here in front of me.
[00:19:27.914 --> 00:19:32.017]  This site's 42explorer.com forward slash ironsteel.htm.
[00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:34.499]  It goes through the whole history of steel.
[00:19:37.581 --> 00:19:38.401]  But what's the point?
[00:19:40.163 --> 00:19:41.944]  Why not just believe Fox News?
[00:19:43.383 --> 00:19:50.706]  This must be a big joke to the globalists, though, that they can sit around and snicker and teach the public that, yeah, fire melted the steel.
[00:19:50.786 --> 00:19:53.047]  It didn't melt the people standing in the gaping holes.
[00:19:53.968 --> 00:19:59.410]  But it turned that steel into molten slag, thousands of degrees hotter than jet fuel can even burn.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.081]  Not making the money you were expecting?
[00:20:03.221 --> 00:20:05.062]  Signing into the hottest new MLM business?

[00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:05.312]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:05.512 --> 00:21:17.794]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:18.214 --> 00:21:18.614]  The U.S.
[00:21:18.654 --> 00:21:24.255]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:24.635 --> 00:21:26.836]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:28.716 --> 00:21:29.777]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:21:29.817 --> 00:21:32.658]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:21:32.778 --> 00:21:38.821]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:21:39.221 --> 00:21:42.583]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:21:42.663 --> 00:21:49.006]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:21:49.566 --> 00:21:53.571]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:21:53.691 --> 00:21:53.951]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.971 --> 00:21:54.211]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.428 --> 00:22:04.992]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:22:05.032 --> 00:22:05.532]  are located?
[00:22:05.753 --> 00:22:09.137]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:22:09.357 --> 00:22:14.062]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:22:14.343 --> 00:22:21.311]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas, brewing environmental catastrophes,
[00:22:21.531 --> 00:22:25.635]  The safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.
[00:22:25.895 --> 00:22:37.926]  Complete with three gigabytes of detailed information on each of 3,000 plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis
[00:22:38.246 --> 00:22:38.767]  I think so.
[00:23:02.876 --> 00:23:04.837]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer.
[00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:07.978]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:09.879]  For a while, anyway.
[00:23:10.399 --> 00:23:13.561]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[00:23:14.181 --> 00:23:16.502]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[00:23:16.822 --> 00:23:20.324]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[00:23:20.684 --> 00:23:22.945]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:24.206]  What's the name again?
[00:23:24.586 --> 00:23:25.586]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[00:23:25.967 --> 00:23:26.787]  It's CalX.
[00:23:27.007 --> 00:23:27.307]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.321]  What makes Cal-X ointment so different?
[00:23:31.521 --> 00:23:39.843]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[00:23:40.884 --> 00:23:45.445]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[00:23:45.665 --> 00:23:54.768]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[00:23:55.468 --> 00:23:56.568]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[00:23:56.628 --> 00:23:57.289]  I'll be right back.
[00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:58.489]  I'm getting some Cal-X.
[00:24:09.589 --> 00:24:37.199]  During the break I've been sitting here reading, just refreshing my memory about what I learned in high school and college about steel construction.
[00:24:37.219 --> 00:24:38.159]  I've also watched a few
[00:24:39.071 --> 00:24:39.912]  Television programs.
[00:24:39.952 --> 00:24:41.493]  I think one on PBS over the years.
[00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:42.674]  I've seen a few shows about it.
[00:24:45.077 --> 00:24:49.060]  But I guess they're going to have to teach something completely new in school and in college.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.082]  And they're teaching it on Fox News.
[00:24:51.102 --> 00:24:52.163]  They're teaching it everywhere.
[00:24:52.183 --> 00:24:57.128]  I hear them with this mantra that fire does melt structural steel.
[00:24:58.309 --> 00:25:04.595]  Well, even your iron cookstove can get 1800 degree fires in it and it turns red hot, but it doesn't melt.
[00:25:05.313 --> 00:25:13.333]  But see they got to turn all this on its head now to teach you that kerosene that burns around 1200 usually with air injected can burn at 1800.
[00:25:15.201 --> 00:25:23.943]  10 melt structural steel that doesn't even begin to get soft until 2750 plus degrees.
[00:25:24.463 --> 00:25:26.703]  Doesn't start melting until around 3000.
[00:25:27.363 --> 00:25:36.325]  And some of the harder structural steels that have these special processes that are done, I'm just reading it here on a major foundry website.
[00:25:36.725 --> 00:25:37.886]  We're talking about 3300 degrees.
[00:25:40.464 --> 00:25:47.669]  There were pools of 24 to 2600 degree molten steel for three weeks after, for a month after, 2000 degrees.
[00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:55.555]  Hundreds and hundreds of degrees hotter than the jet fuel can burn, or paper can burn, or anything else for that matter.
[00:25:56.015 --> 00:25:59.378]  We have temperatures much hotter than the hottest house fires.
[00:25:59.418 --> 00:26:00.238]  Do you understand this?
[00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:03.921]  I know we've talked about this forever, but when they start
[00:26:05.091 --> 00:26:11.599]  It'd be kind of like Fox News saying I could sprout wings, or you could sprout wings, and fly to the moon, or that pigs fly.
[00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:15.503]  I mean, they're really orbs saying there's no North American Union.
[00:26:16.624 --> 00:26:19.287]  I mean, the lying is just getting amazing.
[00:26:20.429 --> 00:26:22.010]  How iron and steel work.
[00:26:23.252 --> 00:26:24.934]  This is from the website How Stuff Works.
[00:26:26.262 --> 00:26:29.765]  Science.HowStuffWorks.com forward slash iron dot htm.
[00:26:30.286 --> 00:26:32.888]  Have you ever wondered how people refine iron and steel?
[00:26:33.268 --> 00:26:37.211]  You probably have heard of iron ore, but how is it that you extract the metal from rock?
[00:26:37.531 --> 00:26:39.393]  Here you can learn about iron and steel.
[00:26:40.253 --> 00:26:45.378]  Then it goes iron and steel making industries from science, technology, and engineering.
[00:26:45.938 --> 00:26:49.781]  And it says the 18th century used coke instead of wood.
[00:26:49.821 --> 00:26:52.904]  That was a purified, almost explosive type of
[00:26:54.585 --> 00:27:02.751]  Highly refined, powdered coal dust, which basically is explosive.
[00:27:03.312 --> 00:27:06.074]  It really gets hot, burns quickly, but I'm digressing.
[00:27:06.494 --> 00:27:18.864]  The 18th century use of coke instead of wood, as charcoal, as the fuel marked the beginning of iron and steel making industry that became so important over the next two centuries.
[00:27:20.023 --> 00:27:21.344]  Then it goes into related sections.
[00:27:21.364 --> 00:27:23.004]  This is actually a college course I'm looking at.
[00:27:23.424 --> 00:27:25.265]  It's science, technology, and engineering.
[00:27:25.685 --> 00:27:26.626]  Casting metal.
[00:27:27.206 --> 00:27:28.126]  From ore to metal.
[00:27:28.166 --> 00:27:29.287]  From ore to metal 2.
[00:27:29.387 --> 00:27:29.607]  Part 3.
[00:27:29.767 --> 00:27:32.688]  Let me just... I actually lost my place here.
[00:27:32.788 --> 00:27:34.849]  It's got the whole... How they do it.
[00:27:34.889 --> 00:27:40.651]  How they have these huge, huge ports that inject air explosively into these chambers.
[00:27:41.131 --> 00:27:42.472]  How they have the coke in there.
[00:27:43.472 --> 00:27:46.994]  That brings the temperatures up to 3500 degrees.
[00:27:50.228 --> 00:27:52.391]  It just goes on and on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:52.611 --> 00:28:01.281]  But again, most people are not going to go to these websites that have a whole history of steel making.
[00:28:01.621 --> 00:28:05.886]  Again, they couldn't even make steel until the last 200 years.
[00:28:07.128 --> 00:28:10.709]  In fact, really in the last 170, 160, you've got Carnegie.
[00:28:11.089 --> 00:28:13.209]  You hear about the Carnegie Endowment, all the Carnegie money.
[00:28:13.609 --> 00:28:21.011]  He's one of the guys that pioneered coke and larger steel mills to mass-produce structural steel.
[00:28:21.631 --> 00:28:26.572]  I know we're not talking about Coca-Cola here, but I'm already digressing.
[00:28:26.592 --> 00:28:27.572]  I have a lot of stuff to cover.
[00:28:28.353 --> 00:28:34.394]  It's just so amazing to have, and Fox News doesn't just do it on their comedy show.
[00:28:35.012 --> 00:28:43.977]  I've seen Gibson on the show he does during the day say repeatedly, fire does melt steel, the fire melted the steel.
[00:28:44.877 --> 00:28:52.501]  Now they know the government's official story is that the fire weakened the steel and caused it to pancake.
[00:28:52.521 --> 00:28:54.322]  When you look at the pancake theory, that's impossible.
[00:28:54.342 --> 00:29:01.686]  It would have taken over 40 seconds to fall, according to all the physicists and engineers that have looked at it, instead of 10 seconds at literal free-fall speeds.
[00:29:04.286 --> 00:29:04.987]  But they don't care.
[00:29:05.767 --> 00:29:09.209]  Instead of just saying it weakened it, they go even further and say, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.652]  Molten steel pools because of kerosene.
[00:29:13.673 --> 00:29:18.656]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can take structural steel, or even iron, and you can put it in a lake of fire.
[00:29:19.316 --> 00:29:22.819]  You could have a billion gallon lake of kerosene.
[00:29:23.019 --> 00:29:23.900]  That's what jet fuel is.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:32.626]  And you could build a big metal structure out in the middle of it, sticking up, and you could light that lake, and it could burn for a thousand years.
[00:29:34.358 --> 00:29:37.920]  A thousand years, and it would never melt.
[00:29:39.421 --> 00:29:42.563]  But, science doesn't matter, facts of life don't matter.
[00:29:42.883 --> 00:29:48.867]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:54.551]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.451 --> 00:29:58.133]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.409 --> 00:30:04.450]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:14.012]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:30:14.452 --> 00:30:21.654]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:30:22.367 --> 00:30:27.873]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:30:28.354 --> 00:30:39.187]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:30:39.947 --> 00:30:41.950]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:31:01.112 --> 00:31:05.695]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:31:06.095 --> 00:31:09.036]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:31:09.357 --> 00:31:11.918]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:31:12.278 --> 00:31:17.101]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:31:17.481 --> 00:31:22.844]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:31:23.144 --> 00:31:26.106]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[00:31:26.306 --> 00:31:26.986]  We're good to go.
[00:31:49.697 --> 00:31:57.561]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.

[00:32:00.122 --> 00:32:05.464]  If you've ever wanted to grow the absolute best tasting fruits and vegetables imaginable, here's some exciting news.
[00:32:05.664 --> 00:32:08.346]  There's a new product designed to make growing delicious produce easy.
[00:32:08.526 --> 00:32:10.927]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's dynamite in the garden.
[00:32:11.147 --> 00:32:17.910]  Proto-Gro is a bioactive superfood for plants that works by providing true broad spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their full genetic expression.
[00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:19.290]  What does this mean in the garden?
[00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:30.673]  It needs mouth-watering fruits and vegetables, brilliantly colored flowers, herbs that finally grow to medicinal strength, blue-ribbon garden produce jam-packed with bioavailable minerals and trace elements, giant pumpkins, even high-potency, high-bricks wheatgrass.
[00:32:30.753 --> 00:32:33.794]  Proto-Gro is a proprietary blend of full-spectrum nutrients from the sea.
[00:32:33.954 --> 00:32:36.534]  It literally contains the basic building blocks of life itself.
[00:32:36.754 --> 00:32:43.736]  In fact, Proto-Gro is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record time that it almost forces plants to grow even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[00:32:44.036 --> 00:32:48.717]  It's also perfect for growing your own survival foods and might just be the ultimate hard times barter item.

[00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:54.879]  877-327-0365.
[00:33:05.608 --> 00:33:08.309]  Riders on the storm.
[00:33:10.229 --> 00:33:13.630]  Riders on the storm.
[00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:18.592]  Into this house we're born.
[00:33:19.292 --> 00:33:22.593]  Into this world we're thrown.
[00:33:23.573 --> 00:33:28.195]  Like a dog without a bone, an actor out of role.
[00:33:28.915 --> 00:33:30.676]  Riders on the storm.
[00:33:33.032 --> 00:33:49.326]  There's a killer on the road His brain is squirming like a toad Take a long holiday Let your children play
[00:33:52.015 --> 00:34:00.207]  If you give this man a ride Sweet memory will die Killer on the road Yeah!
[00:34:11.391 --> 00:34:14.393]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:14.453 --> 00:34:15.694]  In studio, Bob Dacey.
[00:34:15.714 --> 00:34:25.819]  Next hour, as we get into the details, the nuts and bolts of the North American Union, integration by stealth, as the secret government meeting documents have shown.
[00:34:25.859 --> 00:34:28.521]  They talk about how to keep it secret and how it must be kept secret.
[00:34:29.321 --> 00:34:31.582]  And then we have the documents where they're saying they're going to keep it secret.
[00:34:33.943 --> 00:34:38.506]  And they write major news articles across the country and TV shows saying we're liars and it doesn't exist.
[00:34:39.542 --> 00:34:40.262]  So that's coming up.
[00:34:40.282 --> 00:34:41.663]  In fact, I'm going to get into that right now.
[00:34:41.683 --> 00:34:51.649]  I am now on the web and during the break I just can't control myself now.
[00:34:51.689 --> 00:34:53.931]  I was on three or four different university websites.
[00:34:54.931 --> 00:35:00.475]  I'm on a major university out of Australia with a U.S.
[00:35:00.615 --> 00:35:03.677]  government PDF, I guess, exporting
[00:35:07.254 --> 00:35:07.594]  U.S.
[00:35:07.634 --> 00:35:26.640]  developed technologies and some document created in 1945 to the world on steel making secrets and it gets into why Andrew Carnegie developed integrated iron and steel works and it talks about how the Japanese would spend literally months trying to make one sword.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.441]  You could make steel even a thousand years ago.
[00:35:34.028 --> 00:35:40.530]  Again, it was so labor-intensive, it was so hard to purify the iron, get the carbon out of it.
[00:35:43.771 --> 00:35:45.011]  But why even talk about it?
[00:35:45.031 --> 00:36:00.116]  Why am I here arguing and arguing with Fox News that kerosene fires don't melt steel and that you've got people standing in the wounds in the buildings and it isn't melting
[00:36:01.084 --> 00:36:01.744]  Their skin.
[00:36:02.185 --> 00:36:07.588]  And the firefighters are reporting two tiny fires that two lines of firefighters can knock it all down.
[00:36:07.968 --> 00:36:09.429]  And it's black smoke coming out.
[00:36:09.469 --> 00:36:15.292]  Almost all the jet fuel is expended when the plane's impacted and the fiery plumes out the backsides.
[00:36:18.574 --> 00:36:19.795]  It just doesn't matter, though.
[00:36:19.835 --> 00:36:25.438]  They're going to say... Well, they say there's no North American Union.
[00:36:25.498 --> 00:36:25.858]  It's like
[00:36:27.134 --> 00:36:31.137]  For the last six years, Bush has been trying to pass total blanket amnesty.
[00:36:31.157 --> 00:36:32.477]  He was doing it right before 9-11.
[00:36:32.497 --> 00:36:36.340]  He was doing it this week, last week, with the Democrats.
[00:36:38.381 --> 00:36:41.423]  We got some of the subsections of the quote secret bill.
[00:36:41.463 --> 00:36:42.484]  Now, that's not a secret.
[00:36:42.524 --> 00:36:43.945]  It's been in the news.
[00:36:43.985 --> 00:36:45.746]  Oh, it's secret, but it's for your own good.
[00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:54.171]  And then they have a national propaganda putsch
[00:36:55.161 --> 00:37:02.729]  Uh, a huge hoax saying that it gets tough on the illegal aliens and they parade a few of the illegals around complaining about the amnesty plan.
[00:37:03.369 --> 00:37:17.163]  And then it fooled, it did fool a lot of conservatives to think that, think that it really was getting tough on illegals, but the White House and Congress did say, but the agreement's secret and that did make a few people go, wait a minute, why is it secret if it gets tough on the illegals?
[00:37:20.023 --> 00:37:20.463]  That's right.
[00:37:20.864 --> 00:37:24.007]  The government openly says we're going to bring something up to a vote.
[00:37:24.407 --> 00:37:26.949]  No one's going to be allowed to read it except for a few committee chairmen.
[00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:29.011]  And then we're going to bring it out and vote on it.
[00:37:29.451 --> 00:37:30.673]  And it's secret until then.
[00:37:33.535 --> 00:37:35.997]  That's not a free country, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:36.858 --> 00:37:38.660]  And it's the same thing with the North American Union.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.681]  It's the same thing with all of it.
[00:37:40.221 --> 00:37:42.223]  On my TV show last night, I talked about this.
[00:37:43.977 --> 00:37:52.604]  Just a year and a half ago, it was all over the newspapers, it was all over TV, it was all over radio, using Central Texas as a microcosm of the rest of the country, and we are the front line of this fight.
[00:37:54.165 --> 00:38:10.278]  And they announced that it was an urban legend, they even used that term, they said it was a lie, it was a conspiracy theory, that 290 and 183 and Mopac Expressway, that none of these roads, 14 different roads all together, we're talking
[00:38:11.067 --> 00:38:18.070]  William Cannon, which is just a side street, a cut-through street, running across the southern area of Austin.
[00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:21.271]  They said, we are not putting toll roads on any of these roads.
[00:38:21.311 --> 00:38:22.191]  It's a complete lie!
[00:38:23.112 --> 00:38:37.277]  Now, of course, previously they had announced, three years ago they were, and they had the public plans, and they were announcing how great it would be, and people backlashed, and so they went ahead with the plans, literally starting to put in the toll road readers,
[00:38:38.254 --> 00:38:41.595]  While simultaneously telling the public it doesn't exist, it's not happening.
[00:38:42.936 --> 00:38:46.177]  Now, two months ago, they finally were honest and said, you know what?
[00:38:46.497 --> 00:38:51.339]  We are putting toll roads on Mopac on the existing roads in 290, and that's just the way it is.
[00:38:51.359 --> 00:38:55.961]  And they're going to take existing lanes and shut them down and make them toll roads.
[00:38:56.101 --> 00:38:56.461]  Period.
[00:38:57.901 --> 00:39:02.243]  Now, see, that is a military tactic.
[00:39:04.913 --> 00:39:11.054]  Everything we face is military propaganda tactics, but refined to a 21st century state-of-the-art.
[00:39:11.795 --> 00:39:14.815]  You saw it, Waco, in an armored Bradley fighting vehicle.
[00:39:15.835 --> 00:39:19.896]  It tore down at least a third of the back of the building, a third of the total structure.
[00:39:20.436 --> 00:39:31.919]  There is clear photos in the different documentaries, and the government has now had to admit most of this, where it shows the bodies run over, it shows men with machine guns firing with the flare footage shot by the overhead aircraft.
[00:39:33.718 --> 00:39:36.379]  By the Cessna's with Ford Infrared looking radar.
[00:39:37.579 --> 00:39:49.384]  And we know that the Delta Force documents have been released through Congress where they went in in a seek and destroy operation into the building killing people with breathing apparatuses on, apparature.
[00:39:51.284 --> 00:39:58.347]  And as they were ramming that building they said for hours, this is not an assault, this is not an assault, this is not an assault.
[00:39:59.324 --> 00:40:01.585]  They were mad that BATF came in and opened fire.
[00:40:01.645 --> 00:40:03.726]  They thought they'd slaughtered some, quote, cult members.
[00:40:06.607 --> 00:40:10.189]  And then they fired back, but when the BATF put their hands up, they did let them retreat.
[00:40:10.929 --> 00:40:14.751]  And then they encircled them, and they brought in Russian and Israeli psych warfare experts.
[00:40:14.791 --> 00:40:16.592]  That was Time Magazine, Newsweek.
[00:40:17.279 --> 00:40:18.759]  Fort Worth Star-Telegram, that's admitted.
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:24.441]  And it was just a huge kind of black ops barbecue on how to run psychological warfare.
[00:40:24.501 --> 00:40:34.824]  They used ultra-low frequency and different sound weapons and the sound of dead and dying rabbits being torn apart by coyotes with Gregorian monks chanting 24 hours a day.
[00:40:34.844 --> 00:40:36.545]  And they went in and slaughtered.
[00:40:37.045 --> 00:40:42.567]  They put a shape charge on top of the church records building, the only part that was concrete that they hid in from CS gas.
[00:40:44.887 --> 00:40:49.648]  They had Lon Horiyuchi opening fire across the street on them continually of Ruby Ridge fame.
[00:40:49.948 --> 00:40:50.569]  It didn't matter.
[00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:52.329]  The public heard this is not an assault.
[00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:57.950]  That, of course, was for the cameras on the front of the building, which they did allow the government, not the back or the sides.
[00:40:59.711 --> 00:41:04.152]  And that, of course, was for everybody else's... And, of course, the Davidian zone.
[00:41:04.172 --> 00:41:07.173]  Because it'll make you hesitate if you hear this is not an assault.
[00:41:07.953 --> 00:41:10.054]  You know, it's scary to go fight men in a tank.
[00:41:10.114 --> 00:41:11.254]  It's scary to try to get out.
[00:41:12.196 --> 00:41:24.263]  And so, to hear them saying, this is not an assault, we're coming to save you, made people just go ahead and lay down in piles with their clogged gas masks they were trying to put on newborn babies and the towels they were trying to put over them.
[00:41:25.203 --> 00:41:29.866]  And it made them just kind of lay there hoping everything would be okay until Delta Force could kill them.
[00:41:35.129 --> 00:41:37.610]  And that's how it works, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:38.937 --> 00:41:40.759]  And Benton K. Parton, of course, got the photos.
[00:41:41.119 --> 00:41:45.924]  They later bulldozed the whole structure, scraped off a couple feet of topsoil, and buried it in a landfill.
[00:41:45.964 --> 00:41:56.293]  I talked to multiple concrete truck drivers, deliverers, because we built a memorial church out there.
[00:41:57.274 --> 00:42:02.980]  And, uh, I don't know, five or six loads of concrete came out for the foundation piers.
[00:42:03.986 --> 00:42:13.753]  And I talked to one and I talked to the others after the first one told me about, oh yeah, we came and they scooped it all off and then took it to a landfill and for weeks we were there dumping concrete into it.
[00:42:14.113 --> 00:42:15.675]  He said they buried it 20 feet down.
[00:42:15.695 --> 00:42:22.079]  They dug a 20 foot pit, the landfill, and then poured concrete in and mixed it in with all the chunks.
[00:42:26.022 --> 00:42:27.003]  Covering up the crime scene.
[00:42:27.063 --> 00:42:28.624]  I mean, it was that important.
[00:42:28.644 --> 00:42:32.607]  That's how you get rid of Jimmy Hoffa's, you know, the concrete tomb.
[00:42:34.582 --> 00:42:37.928]  They did the same thing at Oklahoma City a few years later when the Feds bombed that.
[00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:47.786]  They blew up the remnants of the building, close to two-thirds of it standing, and then they hauled it off to a Wackenhut private landfill, and then they poured concrete in with the chunks.
[00:42:49.461 --> 00:42:52.282]  They destroyed it, broke them up into smaller pieces, and mixed in with concrete.
[00:42:52.722 --> 00:43:08.745]  And last time I checked, a year ago, they still have armed guards there, 24 hours a day, with a huge barbed wire fence, with razor wire, and at least two guards, 24 hours a day, with MP5s, guarding a huge pit, mixed with concrete.
[00:43:08.765 --> 00:43:15.707]  I wonder why they're doing that, because there's absolute proof of controlled demolition STILL
[00:43:16.602 --> 00:43:23.505]  Archaeologists will be able to go in and get into that concrete and go in and forensically show the blast residue.
[00:43:27.307 --> 00:43:28.687]  But it does make it a lot harder.
[00:43:28.787 --> 00:43:35.310]  I mean, they're ready for that to be exhumed 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, 50 years after the fact.
[00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:36.931]  We're already 12 years after.
[00:43:37.451 --> 00:43:38.891]  They don't play games!
[00:43:41.492 --> 00:43:42.873]  And I've already completely digressed here.
[00:43:42.893 --> 00:43:44.274]  Let me get into North American Union.
[00:43:44.294 --> 00:43:44.914]  My point is,
[00:43:45.626 --> 00:43:47.207]  They tell you it's not an assault.
[00:43:49.929 --> 00:43:51.610]  They say it's not an amnesty program.
[00:43:52.550 --> 00:44:01.655]  And they have illegals parade around and who really believe that it's going to restrict their access when it is completely the end of America and total amnesty.
[00:44:03.636 --> 00:44:04.497]  With the Z Visa.
[00:44:05.257 --> 00:44:06.758]  Just one facet of it.
[00:44:06.778 --> 00:44:08.519]  It's amnesty and worse.
[00:44:11.041 --> 00:44:13.262]  And when they're ramming your church they say it's not an assault.
[00:44:14.838 --> 00:44:23.740]  And when they tell you, go ahead and come out and negotiate with us at Ruby Ridge, and the mother walks out with the baby in her arms, you know, trying to get some money into the house, and they just shoot her in the head.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:27.501]  Pieces of her skull flying into the baby's face.
[00:44:31.202 --> 00:44:36.983]  And they tell you, when the CPS comes to take your children, they don't have any judge, any jury, any due process.
[00:44:37.763 --> 00:44:39.163]  They just get bounties on every child.
[00:44:39.183 --> 00:44:41.404]  They just say, sign here, and we won't take your child.
[00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:48.275]  And if you do read it, it says you're giving custody over to them, and they'll just scream at you and say, sign it or I take them.
[00:44:48.295 --> 00:44:52.218]  And most parents buckle and sign, and then they grab the child and laugh and run off.
[00:44:52.238 --> 00:45:00.485]  And they tell you, everything's fine, just sign, everything's alright, we're not going to take your child, just comply, and then they do.
[00:45:01.145 --> 00:45:02.587]  See, this is not an assault.
[00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:05.169]  Lay down, just lower your defenses.
[00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:17.002]  Just lower your sword, lower your shield, let me walk in up close to you with my sword, and let me raise it above your head just to show you trust me, and then I'm going to be nice to you.
[00:45:17.523 --> 00:45:21.387]  You lower your sword, you lower your shield, and they bring the sword right down on your neck.
[00:45:23.743 --> 00:45:26.365]  And I watched this basic military tactic over and over again.
[00:45:26.686 --> 00:45:30.529]  Going back to World War I, the Germans would do it, the British, the French would do it, the Americans would do it.
[00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:36.334]  Because in that four-year war, they really brought it up to more of an art form by the last year.
[00:45:36.354 --> 00:45:43.520]  And they had loudspeakers saying, just lay down, we'll be nice to you, we'll feed you well, don't fight, this is not an assault, we're not attacking you.
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:48.805]  Of course, they were just firing at them with howitzers and
[00:45:49.694 --> 00:45:50.435]  I don't know.
[00:46:08.453 --> 00:46:10.014]  And this is how a lot of kids get snatched.
[00:46:10.054 --> 00:46:15.398]  A woman's at a salon and she's got a bruise on her where she, you know, fell down on her knee or something.
[00:46:15.418 --> 00:46:17.940]  And they now got the salon workers nationwide.
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:20.582]  I just thought of this again because I heard them announce it on the local radio.
[00:46:21.503 --> 00:46:23.964]  And, you know, any bruise is proof of abuse.
[00:46:24.024 --> 00:46:27.807]  And then they don't really have a bureaucracy for women being abused.
[00:46:27.827 --> 00:46:30.269]  They send out CPS to the house if there's any kids.
[00:46:30.911 --> 00:46:34.413]  They just decided that's proof of abuse and you just wonder why your kids are snatched.
[00:46:34.693 --> 00:46:36.394]  You never even see the file of the reason.
[00:46:36.774 --> 00:46:37.975]  You just know they're at your door.
[00:46:38.255 --> 00:46:39.356]  The real target's the children.
[00:46:39.596 --> 00:46:40.997]  These dumb women don't know that.
[00:46:43.318 --> 00:46:45.979]  They just hear, oh my God, there's all these men beating women.
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.342]  And so they look for bruises on other women.
[00:46:51.342 --> 00:46:55.765]  And then they, it's the same thing with doctors and the nurses and everybody else now.
[00:46:56.225 --> 00:46:59.547]  I mean, you can go to the hospital and tell the doctor, my son fell off the
[00:47:00.347 --> 00:47:01.908]  Young old Jammer, my daughter, did.
[00:47:01.968 --> 00:47:06.793]  I mean, literally, folks, I know middle class people every month that I hear about this happening to.
[00:47:06.813 --> 00:47:12.778]  And my point is, with middle class, it's so bad with the poor who the government knows can't defend themselves, it's just mind-boggling.
[00:47:13.518 --> 00:47:15.360]  But with middle class folks, they don't know.
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:21.305]  Dog bites the child, neighbor's dog bites them, they get scared, it's a little bite, take them, kids are gone.
[00:47:22.046 --> 00:47:25.949]  You fall off the monkey bars, break a finger, something happened to pretty much everybody I know.
[00:47:27.071 --> 00:47:30.755]  Uh, fall off the swing, you know, they're at least going to try to take them.
[00:47:31.456 --> 00:47:33.018]  Doesn't matter how many witnesses you got.
[00:47:33.038 --> 00:47:42.290]  These are family-hating, middle-class-hating, pedophiles most of them, and they just want new kids to rape, folks.
[00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:44.192]  I mean, it's really quite simple.
[00:47:44.807 --> 00:47:46.507]  It's just you can't get your mind around it.
[00:47:46.667 --> 00:47:54.489]  Maybe you can now with the Texas Youth Commission news and the fact that it came out in the news, the top three heads of CPS in Florida were convicted child rapists.
[00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:58.290]  I mean, maybe you can handle the truth if you think you can really go research it and face it.
[00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:04.911]  I mean, frankly, the truth is so horrible, ladies and gentlemen, that I don't even have ways to describe it to you.
[00:48:06.271 --> 00:48:10.252]  But they continue to tell you that this is not an assault and you're not under attack.
[00:48:18.524 --> 00:48:26.246]  And so, they put out news reports every week now saying there is no North American Union.
[00:48:28.806 --> 00:48:36.168]  Every time there's opposition to something they're doing, which they've already announced a thousand times previous, they'll say, oh no, there's no such thing.
[00:48:36.488 --> 00:48:43.169]  Folks, I remember hearing Rush Limbaugh, this is when I, I mean, I remember listening to Rush 15, 20 years ago.
[00:48:43.469 --> 00:48:44.470]  Time has really flown by.
[00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:44.790]  What is it?
[00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:46.430]  Yeah, it's got to be
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:51.261]  My gosh!
[00:48:51.281 --> 00:48:51.681]  20 years?
[00:48:51.701 --> 00:48:53.921]  18, 19 years I've been listening to that guy?
[00:48:54.402 --> 00:48:59.823]  I think 3, 10, 7, oh my gosh!
[00:49:01.864 --> 00:49:04.564]  Amazing, like 18, 17 years, yeah.
[00:49:04.584 --> 00:49:13.907]  I remember hearing him in high school and believing him, but then I remember hearing him say the Council on Foreign Relations doesn't exist about 15 years ago.
[00:49:15.965 --> 00:49:32.052]  And I went, wait a minute, they're teaching Council on Foreign Relations at the college I go to and saying world government's good, and there's Council on Foreign Relations publications in the political science classes, and I watch C-SPAN and it's on there.
[00:49:33.033 --> 00:49:35.014]  Why is Limbaugh saying it doesn't exist?
[00:49:35.034 --> 00:49:37.995]  Then I found out he's been published by a CFR imprint.
[00:49:39.216 --> 00:49:41.077]  And I was like, oh my God.
[00:49:41.777 --> 00:49:44.018]  Wait a minute, the Republicans are controlled too.
[00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:46.956]  They just act like they're fighting globalization.
[00:49:47.096 --> 00:49:48.056]  Oh my gosh!
[00:49:50.057 --> 00:49:58.701]  Then I find out they get even more done in their agendas under Republicans consistently, because it neutralizes the main enemy of the New World Order, which is mainline paleo-conservatives.
[00:49:59.401 --> 00:50:00.562]  The Ron Paul variety.
[00:50:04.383 --> 00:50:06.604]  So, you know, that was a big wake-up call to me.
[00:50:07.585 --> 00:50:10.326]  And so I read where they come out in a
[00:50:12.049 --> 00:50:15.470]  Newspaper story that was in hundreds of papers.
[00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:18.331]  Urban legend of the North American Union feeds on fears.
[00:50:19.652 --> 00:50:26.414]  They said there's no NAFTA highways, no call for a North American currency, no integration of the economies, no integration by stealth.
[00:50:26.695 --> 00:50:28.495]  We're all just insane liars.
[00:50:29.216 --> 00:50:39.439]  And it goes on for page, after page, after page, after page, after page.
[00:50:43.383 --> 00:50:46.608]  It's just like Waco with the tank saying this is not an assault.
[00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:50.594]  Where they said, we promise, there's never been a plan, there'll never be toll roads on mopeds.
[00:50:51.556 --> 00:50:53.759]  I mean, the deals were already signed, they were already building them.
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.523]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:50:56.964 --> 00:50:58.586]  By the time you wake up, it's too late, see?
[00:51:04.588 --> 00:51:10.034]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.435 --> 00:51:18.063]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:25.823]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.203 --> 00:51:37.648]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.948 --> 00:51:41.430]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:43.851]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.171 --> 00:51:47.953]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:05.263]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:05.303 --> 00:52:05.824]  are located?
[00:52:06.024 --> 00:52:09.407]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:52:09.627 --> 00:52:14.351]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:19.635]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:52:19.875 --> 00:52:25.900]  Brewing environmental catastrophes, the safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:39.971]  Complete with three gigabytes of detailed information on each of 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis to help you zero in on the best places
[00:52:40.011 --> 00:52:40.371]  I think so.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.161]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:03.381 --> 00:53:07.083]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:07.403 --> 00:53:09.625]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:53:10.125 --> 00:53:16.328]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:16.488 --> 00:53:21.351]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.591 --> 00:53:30.620]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:36.967]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[00:54:04.255 --> 00:54:04.695]  Don't worry.
[00:54:05.215 --> 00:54:06.776]  This show is documented.
[00:54:07.276 --> 00:54:13.919]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:14.699 --> 00:54:16.119]  That's right!
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.780]  You don't have to trust me.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:25.783]  You can go check out my claims and things I say and find out that we have the truth and that's why you don't have to worry because evil in the end always falls.
[00:54:26.583 --> 00:54:30.965]  The Globalists, the New World Order could kill everybody down to the very last minion.
[00:54:31.833 --> 00:54:40.463]  of this devilish system and that globalist by themselves in some cathedral-like throne room would probably commit suicide just out of their lust to kill.
[00:54:43.566 --> 00:54:55.214]  I do want to just remind you that Bob Dacey is coming up in the next segment, and he will be going into great detail on the, quote, urban legend of the North American Union feeds on fears.
[00:54:55.234 --> 00:55:03.579]  This latest article, and we'll actually walk through it, and how they're spending on the different games that they are indeed playing.
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:12.405]  But before I do that, my friends, I wanted to tell you about some of the new sponsors
[00:55:13.264 --> 00:55:14.265]  that we have.
[00:55:17.026 --> 00:55:23.690]  Well, before I do that, let me just encourage everybody to go up to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:30.894]  You can check out all the sponsors that are there, including the sponsor that I'm about to tell you about, and that's BlackListedHerbs.com.
[00:55:31.255 --> 00:55:34.617]  Just one word, BlackListedHerbs.com.
[00:55:36.438 --> 00:55:42.061]  It's Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois, and they made this offer as easy
[00:55:43.079 --> 00:55:57.824]  For you as possible, all you got to do is give them a call and they will send you a three-month supply of some of their hottest herbal products just to try them out.
[00:55:57.844 --> 00:56:05.306]  And if you don't want them, ladies and gentlemen, then you can simply send the remainder back to them.
[00:56:05.666 --> 00:56:10.787]  And so we'll be telling you a little bit more about that coming up in the next hour.
[00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:20.303]  I think that everybody needs to think about the fight that we're waging against the globalists.
[00:56:21.364 --> 00:56:27.967]  Everybody needs to think about where we stand in all of this, in the information war.
[00:56:28.567 --> 00:56:30.408]  We are having an effect.
[00:56:32.429 --> 00:56:34.150]  We are having a big effect.
[00:56:35.911 --> 00:56:41.754]  And it's clear, as Aaron Russo said a few days ago when he popped in on the show, but with us the entire third hour today,
[00:56:42.972 --> 00:56:45.753]  That we're in a race against time.
[00:56:46.974 --> 00:56:52.117]  And that the New World Order knows that, and they are racing towards the finish line right now.
[00:56:52.737 --> 00:56:56.779]  They are racing towards the finish line in a big way because they know the world is waking up to them.
[00:56:57.299 --> 00:57:00.241]  And now is the time to get involved in the fight against these people.
[00:57:00.701 --> 00:57:02.462]  Now is the time to get the word out.
[00:57:02.542 --> 00:57:05.924]  Now is the time to strike when the iron is hot, as they say.
[00:57:06.464 --> 00:57:09.225]  My film, The Order of Death, it's about 44 minutes long.
[00:57:09.305 --> 00:57:12.607]  It's the extra, really, on the re-edited, remastered
[00:57:14.162 --> 00:57:17.445]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove that we released about a year and a half ago.
[00:57:18.506 --> 00:57:28.075]  It's an amazing film and you get both the films together on the same DVD, The Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove Order of Death Combo.
[00:57:28.756 --> 00:57:34.801]  Did you know that that was the number one video on Google's top 100 videos yesterday?
[00:57:35.402 --> 00:57:35.642]  It got 300,000
[00:57:37.432 --> 00:57:38.913]  I mean, literally, I didn't even promote it.
[00:57:38.933 --> 00:57:43.316]  It just came from nowhere and suddenly got 300,000 plus views in one day.
[00:57:43.336 --> 00:57:44.657]  It's like number 11 today.
[00:57:45.538 --> 00:57:53.203]  And so I would also encourage everybody to go watch the film for free up there on the Google Video Top 100.
[00:57:55.384 --> 00:57:56.305]  And you're saying, well, wait a minute.
[00:57:56.365 --> 00:57:57.526]  One minute you're saying buy the DVD.
[00:57:57.546 --> 00:57:59.027]  The next minute you're saying watch it for free.
[00:57:59.727 --> 00:58:00.388]  Well, yeah.
[00:58:00.608 --> 00:58:03.290]  I mean, that's why I make these films is to expose these people.
[00:58:04.541 --> 00:58:10.306]  And really making a profit is secondary, but that's what we need to make further and future films.
[00:58:10.986 --> 00:58:24.296]  So I do want to encourage everybody who is out there to go to InfoWars.com and buy the Order of Death, have the high quality DVD, and support the folks that made it.
[00:58:24.377 --> 00:58:24.757]  That's us.
[00:58:25.749 --> 00:58:34.655]  But also pass that link around because you may not know all about the Luciferianism and who runs the world and Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove, but most people still don't.
[00:58:35.355 --> 00:58:36.376]  So it's in the top Google 100.
[00:58:36.476 --> 00:58:40.018]  We've got a story out on it at Infowars.com.
[00:58:40.038 --> 00:58:40.658]  Get it and spread it.
[00:58:41.018 --> 00:58:45.901]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.530 --> 00:58:58.170]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.850 --> 00:58:59.910]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.611 --> 00:59:01.751]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.371 --> 00:59:03.172]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.932 --> 00:59:04.852]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.512 --> 00:59:09.454]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.694 --> 00:59:13.815]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.736 --> 00:59:23.179]  I have in my hand the Council on Foreign Relations press release and news article they put out a few weeks ago.
[00:59:24.526 --> 00:59:26.889]  The end of national currencies.
[00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:40.207]  And in this story they say that we need to get rid of national currencies for block currencies over the North American Union, the Asian Union, and the European Union.
[00:59:41.423 --> 00:59:48.747]  The Council on Foreign Relations also wrote different policy papers in the last 30 years, calling for a North American community.
[00:59:49.247 --> 01:00:07.658]  A few years ago, Robert Pasture, one of their front men, a professor, wrote up the latest plan that was integrated into secret treaty on March 23, 2005 in Waco, Texas, between then-Mexican President Vicente Fox, and of course, Paul Martin of Canada, their Prime Minister at the time, and President Bush.
[01:00:09.364 --> 01:00:13.985]  And since then, Lou Dobbs, myself, many others have covered this.
[01:00:14.045 --> 01:00:18.346]  Bob Daisy writing for the New American Magazine and his local TV show have covered it.
[01:00:18.786 --> 01:00:20.087]  We've done endless research.
[01:00:20.407 --> 01:00:23.367]  We got SPP documents from the Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[01:00:23.687 --> 01:00:30.809]  The merger of these three governments in this quote, stealth integration, as they openly call it, secret integration, that's what it means.
[01:00:32.174 --> 01:00:45.500]  And we got the four-year documents earlier this year from last September's meeting in 2006 in Banff, Canada, where the first agenda was how to keep it secret, how to get a regional North American carbon tax, how to merge our militaries, everything!
[01:00:46.281 --> 01:00:50.823]  And then you get articles that was put out by McClatchy Tribune, first appeared in the St.
[01:00:50.843 --> 01:00:52.804]  Louis Post-Dispatch, it was in hundreds of papers.
[01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:55.171]  Papers that aren't even part of the same syndicates.
[01:00:55.191 --> 01:01:00.274]  This was really pushed last week with the headline, Urban Legend of North American Union Feeds on Fears.
[01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:08.859]  They say there's no Napa superhighways, there's no trans-Texas corridors, there's no plan for an Amaro, even MSNBC and CNBC have admitted that.
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.041]  But none of it exists.
[01:01:12.842 --> 01:01:14.323]  And Bob Dacey joins us.
[01:01:14.383 --> 01:01:19.606]  Bob is really an expert on this and has done a lot of, and he's also very cautious
[01:01:20.402 --> 01:01:23.384]  About having documentation in their own words on everything.
[01:01:23.825 --> 01:01:26.207]  And so, Bob, it's good to have you here with us.
[01:01:26.227 --> 01:01:33.372]  But isn't this really just the same military tactic of denying you're attacking someone just so they'll lower their guard and hesitate?
[01:01:33.813 --> 01:01:34.753]  Alex, thank you for having me.
[01:01:34.773 --> 01:01:36.234]  I appreciate coming on today.
[01:01:36.615 --> 01:01:41.699]  Actually, you know, you talk about urban legends, whether the North American Union is an urban legend.
[01:01:42.559 --> 01:01:44.721]  The Easter Bunny is an urban legend.
[01:01:45.239 --> 01:02:01.654]  You know, the North American Union is a solid, concrete, readily documentable goal of the New World Order crowd and to deny it, to be in the mainstream press and to deny the existence of this plan to create a North American Union
[01:02:02.441 --> 01:02:07.307]  Is to either be a complete fool or to be lying in your teeth.
[01:02:07.728 --> 01:02:08.409]  Take your pick.
[01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:15.778]  There are no other options in regard to the North American Union because the documentation is so vast.
[01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:28.198]  When we get back, we're going to walk through some of that, but in the minute or so left we've got in this segment, just break down the basics of what a North American Union will mean and how far along in that stealth integration we are.
[01:02:28.318 --> 01:02:33.042]  Well, the North American Union will mean that we no longer have a United States of America.
[01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:35.904]  I mean, all it is, it's a regional step to global government.
[01:02:36.474 --> 01:02:49.705]  That's been touted by the CFR for decades, and if they succeed in merging United States, Canada, and Mexico into one country, that will effectively take out the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:51.707]  So we won't have a country anymore.
[01:02:51.747 --> 01:02:55.110]  We'll be a very important sub-state
[01:02:55.922 --> 01:03:07.131]  Of a three country region which no longer has the protections in the Constitution, no longer has the protections in the Bill of Rights.
[01:03:07.191 --> 01:03:09.273]  In a short word, we will be toast.
[01:03:11.415 --> 01:03:18.080]  And really that's a big reason the globalists want world government and regional bodies, administrative bodies doing that.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:24.325]  It's not just for their administrative convenience, but also when they set up something new, they get to set the rules.
[01:03:24.947 --> 01:03:29.750]  And under this new system, there is no due process, there is no private property rights for the average person.
[01:03:30.491 --> 01:03:34.793]  There's only stakeholders, which means minion groups of the establishment.
[01:03:35.053 --> 01:03:39.496]  So we'll talk about all that and more with Bob Dacey when we get back on the other side.
[01:03:39.836 --> 01:03:41.297]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:03:41.778 --> 01:03:42.558]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:03:56.443 --> 01:04:01.892]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.273 --> 01:04:09.886]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.603 --> 01:04:17.647]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.047 --> 01:04:29.473]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.773 --> 01:04:33.455]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:35.677]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.017 --> 01:04:39.859]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:54.955 --> 01:04:59.477]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:59.817 --> 01:05:03.898]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:04.198 --> 01:05:04.758]  We listened.
[01:05:05.058 --> 01:05:10.040]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:10.800]  We listened.
[01:05:11.181 --> 01:05:14.222]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:14.642 --> 01:05:15.162]  We listened.
[01:05:15.622 --> 01:05:19.706]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:05:20.086 --> 01:05:20.566]  We listened.
[01:05:20.907 --> 01:05:26.151]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:05:26.571 --> 01:05:27.932]  Again, we listened.
[01:05:28.293 --> 01:05:29.874]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[01:05:30.054 --> 01:05:35.619]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:05:36.059 --> 01:05:38.701]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[01:05:38.901 --> 01:05:39.102]  Only $279.

[01:05:54.036 --> 01:05:56.336]  on the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[01:05:56.456 --> 01:05:59.437]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[01:05:59.497 --> 01:06:00.198]  is a real thing.
[01:06:00.258 --> 01:06:07.120]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:12.522]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:13.443]  We're good to go!
[01:06:39.525 --> 01:06:43.226]  Secure online ordering is available at NutraMedical.com or call 888-212-8871.

[01:06:48.448 --> 01:06:51.249]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:57.992]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.372 --> 01:07:00.653]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:04.129 --> 01:07:11.952]  New American writer, television host, good friend of mine, fellow Austinite, Bob Jacey, is joining us in studio.
[01:07:12.692 --> 01:07:23.657]  For those that just tuned in, we're talking about the mainstream media, who has to know their line, they're not stupid, saying it's an urban legend of a North American union that we're feeding on fears as the headline.
[01:07:24.057 --> 01:07:25.818]  Forget the conspiracy theorist about
[01:07:26.511 --> 01:07:30.059]  JFK assassination, black helicopters, September 11th, or any others.
[01:07:30.099 --> 01:07:30.861]  This is the big one.
[01:07:31.282 --> 01:07:33.708]  As big as, in fact, as the entire continent.
[01:07:34.461 --> 01:07:48.325]  Now, Bob, let's just walk through the evidence of the North American Union and the Security and Prosperity Partnership and why they want global government, and then address the fact that they use the tactic on this and many other subjects of just denying that it even exists.
[01:07:48.405 --> 01:07:50.625]  Where do you start with the evidence?
[01:07:50.725 --> 01:07:59.348]  I mean, you've got this free trade area of the Americas, which they were touting a couple of years ago, and President Bush said he wanted to have it accomplished by 2005.
[01:08:00.948 --> 01:08:06.792]  That was the union, the political and economic and cultural union of the entire Western Hemisphere.
[01:08:08.754 --> 01:08:12.316]  Public statements, on tape, Bush said it.
[01:08:12.556 --> 01:08:19.581]  And so we got a hold of him, we started to pressure him, and of course for other reasons, some of the people in South America didn't care too much for it.
[01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:24.883]  And so they backed off and said, okay, well, we'll take a smaller chunk, we'll take a smaller bite.
[01:08:25.343 --> 01:08:36.832]  I mean, I was at that conference in Waco, the second conference, in 2005 at Baylor, where they were discussing the free trade area of the Americas.
[01:08:37.252 --> 01:08:38.053]  March 23rd.
[01:08:38.313 --> 01:08:39.974]  No, that was the first one.
[01:08:40.014 --> 01:08:43.277]  I was at the second one in October, the follow-up conference.
[01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:58.904]  And the keynote speaker there was Dr. Supachai Panajpati, who was the former head of the World Trade Organization of the United Nations, and he was the current head of the United Nations Trade and Development Council.
[01:08:59.445 --> 01:09:09.970]  He's the keynote speaker, and he said point-blank that in order to accomplish this free trade area of the Americas, we have to have the infrastructure in place in order to do it.
[01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:20.697]  He said he was referring to a project in Southeast Asia where you have to have the infrastructure in place in order to have a free trade area where everyone could participate.
[01:09:21.237 --> 01:09:26.501]  And of course I immediately thanked him privately for saying that in front of my microphone.
[01:09:27.242 --> 01:09:28.624]  That I had a little tape recorder going.
[01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:30.326]  I said, okay, well now we know what it's all about.
[01:09:30.346 --> 01:09:31.427]  Of course, we already did know.
[01:09:31.948 --> 01:09:40.278]  This Trans-Texas Corridor NAFTA Superhighway thing is nothing but a necessary piece of the pie.
[01:09:40.599 --> 01:09:41.980]  It's an infrastructure project.
[01:09:42.241 --> 01:09:43.242]  You cannot link
[01:09:44.125 --> 01:10:06.481]  countries together into one happy country if they don't have unified infrastructure and so you know what's the proof I mean look at this trans-texas corridor NAFTA superhighway thing you know the urban legend you ought to talk to those two ranchers out east of Austin see what kind of legend it is when the state of Texas took their entire ranch from north to south and split it down the middle
[01:10:07.565 --> 01:10:13.469]  Kelly Taylor, who's also a writer for the New American, and I went out there a couple of months ago and talked to these guys.
[01:10:14.029 --> 01:10:24.456]  They took a six million dollar property and split it straight down the middle with the Texas 130 extension, which is nothing more than the Central Texas chunk.
[01:10:25.169 --> 01:10:26.791]  Of this trans-Texas corridor.
[01:10:27.171 --> 01:10:31.256]  Paid him two million dollars for a six million dollar property and ruined their whole business.
[01:10:31.596 --> 01:10:37.163]  Yeah, tell those guys it's an urban legend while the bulldozers are behind him building the thing.
[01:10:38.027 --> 01:10:45.030]  Well, that's the amazing part about this is that we have the text documents, we have the federal documents, they say North American integration.
[01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:47.071]  It's integral to have these roads.
[01:10:47.091 --> 01:10:52.093]  They're going to use the tolls off the roads to fund the North American Union bureaucracy.
[01:10:52.853 --> 01:10:55.734]  That's how the Romans unified their empire was with roads.
[01:10:56.174 --> 01:11:01.896]  By linking them up, they're giving the trademark, the inland port in Kansas City, the Mexicans.
[01:11:01.956 --> 01:11:03.317]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[01:11:04.057 --> 01:11:06.838]  And then in this article they just say it doesn't exist, Bob.
[01:11:07.158 --> 01:11:15.902]  Well, you know, they need to, as you know, you introduced me as someone who really fact-checks and I really like to solidly document everything I say.
[01:11:16.262 --> 01:11:21.664]  Well, is it an urban legend that in 2005 the federal government signed a law, H.R. 3,
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:33.887]  Section 1604, it's the law right now, setting up six pilot programs to start tolling the interstate system to fund this North American Union.
[01:11:34.248 --> 01:11:35.348]  Is that alleged?
[01:11:35.468 --> 01:11:37.250]  No, it's in the Federal Register.
[01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:37.890]  It's the books.
[01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.871]  It's the law.
[01:11:39.351 --> 01:11:42.994]  The federal government is now setting up programs to toll
[01:11:43.929 --> 01:11:48.311]  Existing paid-for infrastructure, and that is undeniable.
[01:11:48.411 --> 01:11:52.472]  Go to the Federal Highway Administration website and read it if you don't believe me.
[01:11:52.732 --> 01:11:56.534]  How can that be something we made up under our tinfoil hats?
[01:11:57.474 --> 01:12:01.056]  But again, it's just a military tactic to say it's camouflage.
[01:12:01.096 --> 01:12:02.716]  Of course they're going to say we're not doing this.
[01:12:03.096 --> 01:12:04.877]  I mean, here's a microcosm example.
[01:12:05.572 --> 01:12:28.330]  Two years ago, we were reporting, because we got the text out documents, that they planned to take 14 different roads, or really, it was 10 different roads, but in several cases they were going to put multiple tolls on different sections, from Mopac to 290 to 183, and put toll roads on it, and then they said, no, no, no, we're not going to put them on Mopac or any roads, that's a lie, tinfoil hat conspiracy theories,
[01:12:29.344 --> 01:12:34.888]  The unelected boards all said it, and now they announced a few months ago, yeah, we're going to put toll roads on Mopac, the existing highway.
[01:12:35.288 --> 01:12:42.733]  Yeah, well, the Mopac thing is a really interesting local macrocosm of the whole problem, because we scared them off.
[01:12:42.813 --> 01:12:44.414]  We actually backed them off of tolling 71, 290, 183.
[01:12:46.475 --> 01:12:51.078]  I mean, we backed them off back in January.
[01:12:51.118 --> 01:12:51.999]  Well, we're saying that.
[01:12:52.619 --> 01:12:53.359]  We're going to do a piecemeal.
[01:13:15.627 --> 01:13:18.469]  In the middle of the existing infrastructure.
[01:13:18.489 --> 01:13:20.270]  Yeah, but they say they're going to take one of the lanes.
[01:13:20.331 --> 01:13:25.814]  Nah, they actually say they're going to put two new roads in there, squeeze the other ones together.
[01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:27.776]  Yeah, take a lane.
[01:13:28.016 --> 01:13:35.061]  And only toll the new roads, which for some reason is supposed to be okay, even though the dirt that they're on we already paid for.
[01:13:35.941 --> 01:13:45.784]  And they think that's just fine, but what's interesting about that project is I came up against the director of the project on a local radio show a couple of months ago.
[01:13:45.804 --> 01:13:46.804]  His name is John Kelly.
[01:13:47.065 --> 01:13:51.546]  He's the chief engineer from Dim Jim Harris, the guys that designed this thing.
[01:13:52.526 --> 01:13:56.488]  And the thing is, the Feds are mandating that it be tolled.
[01:13:56.928 --> 01:14:11.255]  So when you have a mandate for tolled roads and mandates from the local neighborhood associations not to go up, not to go down, and not to go out, what they've done is they have created a project which is doomed to failure.
[01:14:12.416 --> 01:14:17.198]  It's a safety hazard and the only way it's going to work is if
[01:14:17.956 --> 01:14:20.378]  The toll road doesn't get off anywhere.
[01:14:20.418 --> 01:14:38.673]  You can get off on at the north end and get off at the south end, but the exits will not be available to the people on the toll road if you want to go into Austin, because at Rush Hour... Well, they also have the agreement where they can, quote, shut down other roads if they're not profitable.
[01:14:38.894 --> 01:14:43.778]  They are going... Understand, folks, they can shut down other side roads to make the toll road profitable also,
[01:14:44.398 --> 01:14:52.069]  Two Christmases ago, right before Christmas, remember the statesman came out, McCracken, got the documents from TxDOT where they had $6 billion in surplus money.
[01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:57.497]  They have more money and they're telling people they're broke, so they have to give the roads over to the toll companies.
[01:14:57.737 --> 01:15:00.321]  Then it turns out the toll companies really aren't even putting any money in, Bob.
[01:15:00.461 --> 01:15:10.227]  Well, if you go to the Federal Highway Administration website, they actually have it published up there that the Mopac Toll Road Project is one of their projects.
[01:15:10.608 --> 01:15:17.212]  And I confronted John Kelly about this, and he either played dumb or didn't know, I'm not sure which.
[01:15:17.845 --> 01:15:19.826]  But he said, we heard about something about that a year ago.
[01:15:19.846 --> 01:15:30.870]  I said, no, I'm looking at a December update where they're going to give you the money to help to manage tolling these people if you'll do what the federal mandate is on H.R.
[01:15:31.190 --> 01:15:35.352]  3 Section 1604, the bill that I publicized on your show last year.
[01:15:35.372 --> 01:15:38.313]  Which again, will be used to fund the North American Union.
[01:15:38.473 --> 01:15:44.622]  Well, there's the Feds coming in, forcing the federalization and internationalization of our already paid-for infrastructure.
[01:15:44.642 --> 01:15:50.050]  And in this particular case, in the MOPAC case, it's a case where they are forcing the project
[01:15:50.689 --> 01:15:51.349]  We're good to go!
[01:16:13.054 --> 01:16:20.781]  And the physical impossibility of exiting in the middle of the toll road across the three peon lanes.
[01:16:20.801 --> 01:16:22.583]  That's a word I coined, the peon lanes.
[01:16:22.803 --> 01:16:24.285]  The guys that, just the peons.
[01:16:24.565 --> 01:16:26.226]  They're still going to be clogged up at rush hour.
[01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:29.309]  The guys on the toll roads supposed to get off in the middle of this thing?
[01:16:29.730 --> 01:16:32.152]  Absolutely physically impossible!
[01:16:32.752 --> 01:16:33.454]  Impossible!
[01:16:33.834 --> 01:16:36.518]  Someone's going to stop... So there's no way to get off... No!
[01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:37.379]  ...to go where you need?
[01:16:37.439 --> 01:16:37.620]  Right.
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:40.484]  You've got to travel, what, 20 miles to the other end?
[01:16:41.145 --> 01:16:42.988]  If you try to get off at 35th Street...
[01:16:43.817 --> 01:16:46.958]  Or at Mopac, I mean, or at 183 during rush hour.
[01:16:47.458 --> 01:16:50.779]  You are either going to die or you are not going to get off.
[01:16:51.159 --> 01:16:55.120]  And people are going to die on this thing because of the way it's designed.
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:55.980]  Well, Bob, they don't care.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:00.081]  I mean, it causes massive deaths when they shorten the yellow lights to make more money on red light cameras.
[01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:03.742]  It wouldn't be so bad, I guess, if the two new roads were just
[01:17:04.282 --> 01:17:05.443]  More roads, more lanes.
[01:17:05.503 --> 01:17:08.844]  You know, instead of having three lanes going each way, have four lanes going each way.
[01:17:09.184 --> 01:17:12.766]  That way traffic can do what it wants to do and you'd have 25% more capacity.
[01:17:12.986 --> 01:17:13.606]  But no!
[01:17:13.966 --> 01:17:20.189]  The toll roads are going to be on the inside with barriers with little gaps to get off onto the other, you know, where you want to go.
[01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:24.991]  And can you imagine how people are when they're driving and they see some guy zipping along on the other lane?
[01:17:25.211 --> 01:17:26.132]  They're not going to let him in.
[01:17:26.532 --> 01:17:27.693]  They can't let him in.
[01:17:27.713 --> 01:17:28.613]  They're bumper to bumper.
[01:17:28.933 --> 01:17:30.474]  And so people are going to die
[01:17:31.261 --> 01:17:34.142]  And the federal government is what's pushing the toll aspect about this.
[01:17:34.242 --> 01:17:39.183]  Okay, now we've gotten way into a microcosm here in Austin, Texas.
[01:17:39.223 --> 01:17:41.804]  And the media and people did sound record there were going to be no toll roads.
[01:17:42.164 --> 01:17:49.286]  And so it's kind of a semantical deception that they're just going to tear up and basically take a lane and then add some down the middle there.
[01:17:50.046 --> 01:17:56.627]  But I want to get back into the North American Union itself, their own documents, Robert Pasture, the SPP documents.
[01:17:56.667 --> 01:17:57.728]  I have them all here in front of me.
[01:17:57.748 --> 01:17:58.768]  And then this announcement
[01:17:59.168 --> 01:18:02.015]  In this new article written by Philip Dine, we've got to look into him.
[01:18:02.095 --> 01:18:03.117]  I guarantee he's a globalist.
[01:18:10.462 --> 01:18:16.185]  Right here, they need to talk to Robert Pasture, the guy who was the chief guy riding the building in North America.
[01:18:16.205 --> 01:18:20.066]  Well, he's in here saying it's on North American Union, but then he calls for one in the documents.
[01:18:20.086 --> 01:18:30.251]  Well, he talks about the MRO all the time, so I don't understand how they can say there's no move toward that when it's coming out of their own mouths constantly.
[01:18:30.651 --> 01:18:32.812]  Again, I don't... This Lyon stuff...
[01:18:33.493 --> 01:18:34.674]  It's gotten real old.
[01:18:35.054 --> 01:18:35.294]  You know?
[01:18:35.595 --> 01:18:36.175]  It really has.
[01:18:36.275 --> 01:18:37.516]  It's just, it's not working.
[01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:43.300]  Tell the 2,000 people that marched up Congress Avenue last March demanding no Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:46.342]  Tell the farmers, the ranchers... They're delusional.
[01:18:46.382 --> 01:18:49.204]  They all must be a bunch of tinfoil hats wearing suits.
[01:18:49.584 --> 01:18:50.065]  They're nuts.
[01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:51.306]  Lou Dobbs is crazy too.
[01:18:51.326 --> 01:18:51.706]  Stay there.
[01:18:51.726 --> 01:18:53.267]  Tell the entire state legislature.
[01:18:54.033 --> 01:19:02.377]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing Prudent Places USA, an interactive CD book that is your premier resource for hard-to-find information.

[01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:58.211]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us up the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:19:58.231 --> 01:19:59.491]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:19:59.651 --> 01:20:03.232]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:20:03.512 --> 01:20:06.032]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[01:20:06.432 --> 01:20:08.192]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:20:08.492 --> 01:20:10.793]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:17.436]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:20:17.476 --> 01:20:19.977]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:20:20.057 --> 01:20:21.478]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[01:20:29.642 --> 01:20:32.103]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.

[01:20:35.904 --> 01:20:38.605]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[01:20:38.625 --> 01:20:39.245]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[01:20:53.587 --> 01:20:57.172]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[01:20:57.433 --> 01:20:58.294]  Look no further!
[01:20:58.594 --> 01:21:01.158]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[01:21:01.599 --> 01:21:10.031]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[01:21:10.291 --> 01:21:10.572]  I think so.
[01:21:27.773 --> 01:21:28.273]  We're good to go.
[01:21:53.402 --> 01:21:56.345]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:21:56.505 --> 01:22:01.771]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:22:02.032 --> 01:22:07.297]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:22:07.738 --> 01:22:08.839]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:22:09.199 --> 01:22:18.285]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:22:18.525 --> 01:22:20.126]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:22:20.366 --> 01:22:29.212]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:22:29.592 --> 01:22:31.693]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:22:33.414 --> 01:22:34.195]  Keep it natural.
[01:22:34.515 --> 01:22:42.663]  Call Cal Bend Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[01:22:42.923 --> 01:22:46.927]  Try Cal Bend Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[01:22:46.967 --> 01:22:48.168]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:23:12.838 --> 01:23:17.322]  It's all part of a larger integrated program of control.
[01:23:18.703 --> 01:23:25.689]  You've got the minimalization of the borders, legalizing the flow of quote, immigrants,
[01:23:27.097 --> 01:23:30.263]  Or migrations, as the CFR and others term it.
[01:23:30.303 --> 01:23:34.430]  It's all a global plan, implemented through the UN, through treaties.
[01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:46.555]  This whole Senate plan for blanket amnesty, which they tried to hoax and claim was an amnesty, now they've said, okay, we'll bring it up the next few weeks again, but the bill, the new version, is still secret from you.
[01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:52.717]  But just trust us, we're keeping it secret for a good reason, and we'll be passing that unannounced here in the next few weeks.
[01:23:53.277 --> 01:24:04.222]  So this is not really a victory, it just means that they've had to submerge, like a submarine for now, only to resurface and fire torpedoes, now they said sometime in early June, or in the next couple weeks,
[01:24:05.151 --> 01:24:07.452]  Bob Dacey, I want to get your perspective.
[01:24:07.472 --> 01:24:08.972]  I mean, they tell us how they're doing it.
[01:24:09.813 --> 01:24:12.554]  They're paying Social Security to Mexicans and Canadians now.
[01:24:13.154 --> 01:24:18.416]  They're menializing the agriculture laws, the regulations, law enforcement, military.
[01:24:18.456 --> 01:24:19.316]  It's all admitted.
[01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:26.772]  And they're saying that, oh, the Euro's getting so strong, as the Trilateral Commission said 25 years ago.
[01:24:27.513 --> 01:24:31.796]  Once the Euro got strong, they would then say, oh, see, we need an Amaro to counter it.
[01:24:32.096 --> 01:24:38.460]  Then they're going to have currency battles between that, and say, if we just unified it all, we wouldn't have these speculatory problems.
[01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:49.030]  The same way they got the Federal Reserve Act here, claiming they wanted to stop runs on banks and a few problems that happened before, only to give us a giant depression right after they'd done it.
[01:24:49.330 --> 01:24:54.015]  I mean, the process they promised to give us 30 years ago, 25 years ago, they're following, Bob.
[01:24:54.595 --> 01:25:03.577]  Well absolutely and you know people that say that the North American Union is a big conspiracy theory and the NAFTA superhighway doesn't exist and these toll roads aren't coming.
[01:25:03.597 --> 01:25:20.240]  Well they need to ask Rudy Giuliani's law firm then why he is representing Concesiones Infraestructuras de Transporte of Spain, the toll road builder, which just built the part of the Trans-Texas Corridor east of Austin and is going further south and of course is definitely going to be in the bidding process for
[01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:33.591]  For more of it, I don't understand why is Rudy Giuliani representing a non-existent company building a non-existent road as he runs for President of the United States with a strong national security policy?
[01:25:33.911 --> 01:25:37.695]  And of course, Centra literally comes in and buys the legislatures publicly.
[01:25:38.195 --> 01:25:50.724]  And then TxDOT two years ago, this is the agency that's non-elected, it told the Legislature and the Attorney General, we're not going to show you our agreement, it's secret, with a foreign Spanish company.
[01:25:50.884 --> 01:25:54.727]  Yeah, and then of course, that's the leading Republican candidate for President, right?
[01:25:55.027 --> 01:26:01.392]  Well, you switch over to the Democrats, Hillary for example, look what she did, was it two or three weeks ago?
[01:26:01.952 --> 01:26:05.638]  She appoints Raul Izaguirre to be her campaign manager.
[01:26:06.099 --> 01:26:08.463]  Raul is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:26:08.863 --> 01:26:12.589]  He's one of the guys that wrote Building a North American Community.
[01:26:12.650 --> 01:26:14.052]  His signature is on it.
[01:26:14.767 --> 01:26:19.831]  For many, many years, he was the president of the National Council of La Raza Unida.
[01:26:20.071 --> 01:26:20.972]  That means the race.
[01:26:21.032 --> 01:26:21.572]  The race.
[01:26:22.093 --> 01:26:26.216]  And he is currently a professor at Arizona State University.
[01:26:26.236 --> 01:26:34.823]  I wrote an article a couple of months ago for you, for InfoWars.com, Treason 101, Arizona State University.
[01:26:36.865 --> 01:26:46.299]  By the way, I've had his students and the students contact me and challenge me and say it's all lies, he's a great man, and what's wrong with the North American Union?
[01:26:46.319 --> 01:26:47.220]  They're not even denying it.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:51.967]  Well, they're trying to teach these poor students in Arizona, they have a whole course
[01:26:52.754 --> 01:26:57.597]  Well, you know, they take all the best and brightest and have modeled you in for 30 years, 40 years.
[01:26:57.957 --> 01:26:59.838]  Now they've got model North American Union.
[01:26:59.918 --> 01:27:04.040]  Well, you know, I think you mentioned to me earlier that one of those students wanted to contact me.
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:08.902]  Well, if they did, they didn't try very hard because they never did contact me.
[01:27:08.922 --> 01:27:10.383]  I think they're afraid of coming up to me.
[01:27:10.403 --> 01:27:11.624]  It was this, yeah, we gave him your contact.
[01:27:11.644 --> 01:27:14.905]  It was this challenging, you need to prove that he's a traitor.
[01:27:14.966 --> 01:27:15.626]  How dare you?
[01:27:15.786 --> 01:27:21.489]  Well, I got to admit, the headline I gave it, Treason 101 is inflammatory.
[01:27:21.969 --> 01:27:23.811]  But it's also factual.
[01:27:24.031 --> 01:27:30.856]  When you teach the destruction of the United States of America in an American university, you are teaching treason.
[01:27:31.257 --> 01:27:31.717]  Period.
[01:27:32.578 --> 01:27:33.619]  Look up the definition.
[01:27:33.639 --> 01:27:45.809]  You know, so don't tell me it's not treason 101 to teach the students all across America, and especially at Arizona State University, that merging the United States of America with a narco state is cool,
[01:27:47.034 --> 01:27:47.915]  That's insane!
[01:27:48.535 --> 01:27:49.536]  It's absolutely insane!
[01:27:49.556 --> 01:27:52.478]  Of course, it's only insane if you believe in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:27:52.498 --> 01:27:59.142]  Well, when we get back, I want to talk about hiring Mexican police to police America, hiring foreign military to police America, and to be in the military, and that's all mainstream news.
[01:27:59.562 --> 01:28:00.823]  But again, they'll deny that's happening.
[01:28:01.283 --> 01:28:05.986]  Like, on one side, they announce it and say it's good, but then if you criticize it, they say you're crazy, it doesn't exist.
[01:28:06.366 --> 01:28:08.628]  And they've always done that with everything, but the key here is,
[01:28:09.713 --> 01:28:12.558]  They've sold to the young people that, oh, it's just the next phase.
[01:28:12.618 --> 01:28:20.111]  First we had hunter-gatherer, then agrarian, then nation-state, city-state, nation-state, and now empires, and now world government.
[01:28:20.766 --> 01:28:25.850]  The problem here is, this is not the next step, like it's Star Trek or something, where they teach you this.
[01:28:27.071 --> 01:28:34.976]  This is where they abolish the old forms of jurisprudence, due process, common law, and they're replacing it with a whole new system.
[01:28:34.996 --> 01:28:40.801]  So let's talk about the UN International Declaration of Human Rights, where Article 29 and 30 say you have no rights.
[01:28:41.121 --> 01:28:42.322]  Let's get into the foreign troops.
[01:28:43.763 --> 01:28:44.703]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.144 --> 01:28:46.665]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.650 --> 01:28:50.343]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.583 --> 01:28:59.725]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:28:59.946 --> 01:29:01.707]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:29:01.967 --> 01:29:08.250]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:29:08.551 --> 01:29:14.674]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:29:14.914 --> 01:29:20.938]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[01:29:21.238 --> 01:29:27.641]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:29:27.781 --> 01:29:31.322]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:29:31.623 --> 01:29:35.324]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:29:35.524 --> 01:29:38.065]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:29:38.185 --> 01:29:39.246]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:39.326 --> 01:29:39.526]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:39.546 --> 01:29:39.606]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:54.190 --> 01:29:57.972]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[01:29:58.353 --> 01:30:05.677]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[01:30:06.118 --> 01:30:17.065]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:17.585]  Central.
[01:30:17.965 --> 01:30:23.549]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[01:30:23.889 --> 01:30:29.771]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[01:30:30.271 --> 01:30:35.012]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[01:30:35.392 --> 01:30:40.193]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[01:30:40.633 --> 01:30:41.934]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[01:30:41.994 --> 01:30:42.414]  Central.
[01:30:42.994 --> 01:30:50.416]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetsmen.org.
[01:30:52.998 --> 01:31:01.647]  David J. Smith, did you know that a plan was laid down in the 1870s to conquer the world for world government that has not been deviated from since its inception?
[01:31:02.428 --> 01:31:07.413]  These conspirators said that they must have many revolutionary wars and three world wars.
[01:31:08.134 --> 01:31:13.039]  Have we witnessed these wars of liberation since the 1920s and then World War I and World War II?
[01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:23.428]  The Illuminati, who are worshippers of Lucifer, are now preparing for the final conflict, the Third World War, to produce their One World Government.
[01:31:24.008 --> 01:31:31.655]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming about by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:31:32.435 --> 01:31:33.857]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[01:31:33.877 --> 01:31:34.177]  That's 1-800.
[01:31:42.402 --> 01:31:42.803]  516-8736.
[01:31:45.306 --> 01:31:48.249]  Call now to request your subscription.
[01:31:48.269 --> 01:31:51.253]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:31:59.737 --> 01:32:02.799]  Folks, I've got a great deal for our listeners.
[01:32:02.819 --> 01:32:05.920]  It's Schilocene, and in one of the foreign languages, it's what?
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:06.621]  Schilajet?
[01:32:29.887 --> 01:32:38.209]  And it is found on mountains around the world from the Himalayas and in Afghanistan, China, Nepal, Pakistan, Tibet, Norway.
[01:32:39.269 --> 01:32:43.070]  And it's just an amazing herbal remedy and treatment.
[01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:47.731]  I've done quite a bit of research on this stuff and it's just one of the products.
[01:32:47.751 --> 01:32:48.831]  They've got it blacklisted.
[01:32:49.431 --> 01:32:50.511]  Herbs.com.
[01:32:50.531 --> 01:32:53.112]  We have a banner up on Infowars.com.
[01:32:53.952 --> 01:32:59.373]  Solutions from Science in Thomas, Illinois made this offer as easy to swallow as possible.
[01:33:00.083 --> 01:33:09.773]  So I have asked Lucie's from Science to send you a three month supply of their product called Shilicene and open a special line of credit for my listeners so you don't have to pay up front.
[01:33:10.093 --> 01:33:12.676]  It's pretty easy to have some sent to you.
[01:33:13.037 --> 01:33:14.838]  Just go to their website and get some.
[01:33:14.938 --> 01:33:16.640]  Of course, don't pay anything right now.
[01:33:17.121 --> 01:33:18.462]  Just go to blacklistedherbs.com
[01:33:19.901 --> 01:33:21.442]  And you don't have to give them a credit card or anything.
[01:33:21.462 --> 01:33:24.664]  They'll just send it to you for three months, and if you don't like it, send it back.
[01:33:25.164 --> 01:33:26.605]  Here's what they mean by that.
[01:33:26.665 --> 01:33:29.767]  Solutions from Science won't even let you pay with your credit card if you don't want to.
[01:33:30.107 --> 01:33:31.387]  They don't want you to run up your credit card.
[01:33:31.447 --> 01:33:31.628]  Nope.
[01:33:32.068 --> 01:33:32.688]  And it goes on.
[01:33:32.768 --> 01:33:42.874]  So they've offered to send all my great listeners a 90-day supply of Shilocine with just an invoice to pay later if you find that it's everything that they've said it is.
[01:33:43.534 --> 01:33:44.194]  No money down.
[01:33:44.254 --> 01:33:45.555]  No credit cards needed to order.
[01:33:46.035 --> 01:33:50.096]  I told Solutions to trust my listeners completely and to give them a great deal.
[01:33:50.116 --> 01:33:50.736]  That's what they've done.
[01:33:51.197 --> 01:33:53.337]  Order some online or call 877-327-0365.
[01:33:58.799 --> 01:34:05.104]  And tell whoever takes your call that you want the Chelicene Nothing Down Pack from Alex.
[01:34:05.485 --> 01:34:05.925]  That's it.
[01:34:06.065 --> 01:34:07.146]  It's easy.
[01:34:07.166 --> 01:34:07.506]  877-327-0365.
[01:34:08.187 --> 01:34:14.672]  Or again, ladies and gentlemen, our great sponsor's website, blacklistedherbs.com.
[01:34:14.752 --> 01:34:18.695]  You can learn a lot more on our website, not just about Chelicene, but a lot of other great products.
[01:34:19.276 --> 01:34:25.781]  Also, I would encourage all of you, the listeners, to go to Google Video today.
[01:34:25.981 --> 01:34:27.422]  It was a nice surprise.
[01:34:28.991 --> 01:34:33.473]  Terror Storm's gotten up into the top five of Google Video.
[01:34:33.573 --> 01:34:35.534]  It has never hit number one.
[01:34:36.635 --> 01:34:37.695]  My memory says it has.
[01:34:37.735 --> 01:34:38.816]  I may have a screen shot of that.
[01:34:38.836 --> 01:34:42.457]  I know it's gotten to the top five, but I don't think it's ever gotten to number one.
[01:34:42.478 --> 01:34:47.120]  I mean, you're talking about upwards of a million a day on a big traffic day.
[01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:49.661]  A million views if you're at number one.
[01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:54.291]  It might have been a slow day yesterday on Google Video, so we had over 300,000 views.
[01:34:54.311 --> 01:34:59.312]  You have to watch the whole film, by the way, on there for it to count as a view.
[01:34:59.873 --> 01:35:06.994]  Over 300,000 people watched the film I made almost two years ago, The Order of Death, for free, on Google Video yesterday.
[01:35:08.135 --> 01:35:11.476]  And in one day, it just somehow got out there, went viral.
[01:35:11.936 --> 01:35:13.676]  You never know what's going to go viral.
[01:35:15.377 --> 01:35:16.137]  And it went viral.
[01:35:17.387 --> 01:35:22.988]  It sunk today to number 11, which is still going to be hundreds of thousands of people watching it.
[01:35:23.508 --> 01:35:34.350]  But I would encourage everybody out there to go to Infowars.com, where we have a story about it, PrisonPundit.com, to get that story, to email it out, to blog it, so that more people will watch the film.
[01:35:34.410 --> 01:35:42.852]  Now, it took me, and that was only about a 44 minute film, so it only took me about, I don't know, four or five months to make it.
[01:35:43.935 --> 01:35:52.199]  Also, we had a new infiltrator who worked there who got video in 2005 of the ritual and of the cremation of Kare and the Luciferian activities.
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:58.483]  We integrated that with Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove footage that we shot years ago when we first infiltrated in 2000.
[01:35:59.083 --> 01:36:06.447]  And on the same DVD is the original Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove updated, re-edited, remastered.
[01:36:06.927 --> 01:36:08.728]  Because I made Dark Secrets in three weeks.
[01:36:08.848 --> 01:36:10.389]  I got back in 2000 in July.
[01:36:10.409 --> 01:36:11.730]  I was getting death threats.
[01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:22.833]  Because they knew I'd gotten footage, it had been in the news, and I remember first airing the footage like the day I got back on Bob Dacey's show, because for my life I wanted to rush and get it on.
[01:36:22.893 --> 01:36:24.173]  In fact, Bob just reminded me of that.
[01:36:24.534 --> 01:36:28.855]  He was mouthing, and remember you came on my show, and I do remember that.
[01:36:28.895 --> 01:36:29.575]  Bob, you want to talk about it?
[01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:31.270]  Yeah, that was kind of neat.
[01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:34.613]  You had just gotten back, it was what, July of 2000, I think it was?
[01:36:34.633 --> 01:36:35.954]  Yeah, I got back on July 20th.
[01:36:36.094 --> 01:36:45.421]  And my show, The Simple Truth, was the one that was kind of next up in the local cable access TV sequence, and I called you up and I said, hey Alex, you want to come on and show us some of that stuff?
[01:36:45.722 --> 01:36:48.564]  And you said, quote, yeah, I got to get to something before they kill me.
[01:36:49.205 --> 01:36:51.486]  And so you came on the show, and I remember I
[01:36:52.427 --> 01:36:53.748]  Tongue-in-cheeked it a little bit.
[01:36:53.828 --> 01:36:57.150]  I named that show Alex Jones and the Temple of Doom.
[01:36:57.770 --> 01:37:02.633]  And you put some of that footage on that show, and we were the first TV show ever to show that.
[01:37:02.653 --> 01:37:05.335]  And I consider that to be an honor.
[01:37:05.595 --> 01:37:06.115]  I really do.
[01:37:06.315 --> 01:37:07.676]  You know, do you have a tape of that show?
[01:37:07.716 --> 01:37:09.877]  We ought to get that and put it up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:09.897 --> 01:37:12.238]  Somewhere in my junk pile, yes sir.
[01:37:12.298 --> 01:37:13.939]  Bob, I told you this about six months ago.
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:17.942]  Give me some of your top shows, some of your classics, and I want to put them on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:18.862 --> 01:37:19.663]  Well, I will try.
[01:37:19.943 --> 01:37:20.564]  Bring them over here.
[01:37:20.584 --> 01:37:22.385]  We'll encode them and upload them for the members.
[01:37:23.065 --> 01:37:25.307]  Because that stuff needs to be seen.
[01:37:26.007 --> 01:37:26.948]  Bring that classic, though.
[01:37:27.568 --> 01:37:29.630]  I'd forgotten about that, but to make a long story short...
[01:37:30.453 --> 01:37:37.958]  You can get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, cut down to an hour and a half, plus the 44, 45 minute film, Order of Death, on the same DVD.
[01:37:37.999 --> 01:37:42.162]  Two films, 1995, Infowars.com, or 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones.
[01:37:50.007 --> 01:37:50.387]  That's right.
[01:38:11.336 --> 01:38:13.797]  That's number one on Google yesterday, number 11 today.
[01:38:14.797 --> 01:38:21.320]  Get a PrisonPlanet.tv 15 cent a day membership and it's encoded a lot clearer up on the site for members.
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.700]  That's another reason to be a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:30.203]  Get America, Freedom to Fascism, Loose Change 2nd Edition, 9-11 Mysteries, Demolitions, Riddles in Stone, my new film Terror Storm.
[01:38:30.303 --> 01:38:35.744]  Only a few hundred left now and I'm signing each copy that goes out before the 2nd edition comes out in July.
[01:38:35.784 --> 01:38:37.345]  We will definitely sell out of this.
[01:38:38.075 --> 01:38:41.418]  It looks like for like a month before the new one is available.
[01:38:41.458 --> 01:38:45.261]  So if you want an original Terror Storm, get it at Infowars.com now.
[01:38:45.641 --> 01:38:51.125]  We're going to hold back a few too when we discontinue it in a week or so, or two weeks.
[01:38:51.145 --> 01:38:52.086]  I don't know how long it will take.
[01:38:52.886 --> 01:38:58.971]  In case your mail orders come in, we'll get those out to you at 3001 Champlain, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:39:00.713 --> 01:39:03.074]  But Bob, seriously, I forgot that Temple of Doom special.
[01:39:03.495 --> 01:39:05.116]  I think that was the day after I got back.
[01:39:05.786 --> 01:39:08.849]  I was getting threatening emails and threatening calls, and we're going to kill you.
[01:39:09.869 --> 01:39:12.872]  The British media had made dubs that night before we left.
[01:39:13.693 --> 01:39:15.314]  They literally tore out the next morning.
[01:39:15.334 --> 01:39:16.074]  We stayed a few more days.
[01:39:16.094 --> 01:39:17.496]  They were scared in Northern California.
[01:39:17.516 --> 01:39:17.936]  They left.
[01:39:18.717 --> 01:39:23.801]  Then they tried to mail it to BBC, and they made the copies, and it never got there.
[01:39:24.301 --> 01:39:26.683]  Then we made another copy and sent it to World of Wonder in L.A.
[01:39:26.803 --> 01:39:27.624]  Those were erased.
[01:39:28.331 --> 01:39:29.472]  Then they really got spooked.
[01:39:29.492 --> 01:39:31.994]  I had to send it under a fake name to another address to get it.
[01:39:32.274 --> 01:39:35.717]  So they had black ops, spooks, spies getting the tapes.
[01:39:36.157 --> 01:39:38.819]  And we were getting threats, so I got back and we dumped it on TV.
[01:39:38.859 --> 01:39:40.761]  But we got it on the Simple Truth, didn't we Alex?
[01:39:40.821 --> 01:39:41.861]  I remember that show now.
[01:39:42.282 --> 01:39:44.263]  Local Cable Access TV.
[01:39:44.403 --> 01:39:46.605]  They couldn't stop the Local Cable Access TV.
[01:39:46.625 --> 01:39:47.886]  They couldn't stop the Simple Truth.
[01:39:48.046 --> 01:39:51.629]  You know, by the way Bob, for the first time in 13 years I'm not doing a show this season.
[01:39:52.229 --> 01:39:58.073]  That gives me the opportunity to announce to the local version of your crowd, we've been off the air for four months due to unrelated things.
[01:40:16.423 --> 01:40:18.965]  But the simple truth, it's been on the air for eight years.
[01:40:19.045 --> 01:40:21.746]  We will be back again next month.
[01:40:22.547 --> 01:40:24.068]  Same bat time, same bat channel.
[01:40:24.108 --> 01:40:26.109]  I don't know exactly what you know how it is.
[01:40:26.129 --> 01:40:27.650]  You never know until they give you your assignment.
[01:40:28.090 --> 01:40:35.595]  But we've been off the air for four months, but we will return next month for all you local Austin Time Warner Cable Access viewers.
[01:40:35.675 --> 01:40:37.636]  We will be back.
[01:40:37.696 --> 01:40:43.640]  Of course, we had to sue the city and send the director to prison and everything else just to make it survive.
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:45.941]  And now we're having to battle other stuff down there.
[01:40:46.261 --> 01:40:51.865]  Yeah, it's kind of like, well, I don't know, they keep making it more difficult to jump through their hoops.
[01:40:52.265 --> 01:40:59.530]  Literally, that's why I'm just like, you know, I just am too busy to go jump through 50 hoops this time.
[01:40:59.650 --> 01:41:03.253]  I'm still going to shoot shows here and we're still going to air them on tape down there.
[01:41:03.473 --> 01:41:04.414]  Well, you know, simple truth.
[01:41:05.254 --> 01:41:06.755]  They've been white-gloving me when I'm down there.
[01:41:06.795 --> 01:41:07.876]  You know, I do the simple truth.
[01:41:07.956 --> 01:41:13.480]  I'm the host, but, you know, Jeff Kantoff is a good friend of yours and a good friend of mine is one of their producers.
[01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:24.450]  Kelly Taylor is the other producer and of course Kelly Taylor is now the spokesperson really for the John Birch Society on the NAFTA superhighway.
[01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:26.833]  I just saw her in a newspaper article speaking in Midland was it?
[01:41:26.913 --> 01:41:28.434]  Yeah, she was just in Midland.
[01:41:28.775 --> 01:41:30.837]  She's on the JBS Speakers Tour.
[01:41:31.617 --> 01:41:36.539]  Uh, you know, you want to go hear Kelly Taylor talk about the North American Union and the NAFTA Superhighway?
[01:41:36.779 --> 01:41:38.180]  I mean, that's going on.
[01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:41.341]  We have really, really done a lot of work here.
[01:41:41.361 --> 01:41:42.681]  Well, that's how it works, Bob.
[01:41:42.721 --> 01:41:43.682]  I mean, I woke you up.
[01:41:43.722 --> 01:41:44.722]  You woke up a bunch of people.
[01:41:45.062 --> 01:41:47.203]  You got her and many others involved, but just mushrooms.
[01:41:47.503 --> 01:41:55.172]  Yeah, and of course, Kelly, I think the Birch Society prefers her to me because I'm in the Alex Jones wing of the Birch Society, and she's not.
[01:41:55.272 --> 01:42:01.300]  She's a lifelong Bircher, and she's more controlled than I am, I suppose.
[01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:03.182]  I don't know what the word is.
[01:42:03.402 --> 01:42:03.982]  Conservative.
[01:42:04.002 --> 01:42:07.265]  Conservative that I am, because every once in a while I stray off the reservation.
[01:42:07.705 --> 01:42:10.647]  Like sitting here right now, it's an awesome reservation to be strayed off of.
[01:42:10.687 --> 01:42:12.248]  I'll tell you, I'm very proud to be sitting here.
[01:42:12.348 --> 01:42:13.529]  Okay, Bob, let's get into this.
[01:42:13.549 --> 01:42:15.770]  But anyway, we're talking about the North American Union.
[01:42:15.991 --> 01:42:20.013]  Yeah, yeah, let's, because we've only got about 15 minutes left here of air time.
[01:42:20.033 --> 01:42:23.736]  I'll give you about five in the next hour before Aaron Russo gets here so we can really go through this.
[01:42:24.778 --> 01:42:29.241]  The reason we have Bob here today is they're saying that the North American Union doesn't exist.
[01:42:29.401 --> 01:42:41.529]  Okay, now they've got SPP, they've got the CFRs openly calling for the Amaro, CNBC, MSNBC are reporting it, but they say that Lou Dobbs and everybody else in other articles, say myself and others, are we are liars.
[01:42:42.170 --> 01:42:43.371]  We are insane.
[01:42:43.811 --> 01:42:44.972]  This doesn't exist, Bob.
[01:42:45.032 --> 01:42:47.854]  And Judicial Watch, the conservative watchdog group that
[01:42:48.334 --> 01:42:53.598]  Made them release the minutes of the BAMF Alberta meeting from late last year.
[01:42:53.938 --> 01:42:55.679]  There must be a bunch of nuts, too.
[01:42:55.739 --> 01:43:00.122]  I mean, it's getting really old, Alex.
[01:43:00.202 --> 01:43:11.430]  I mean, again, if you are a member of the mainstream press, if you're listening, and you are spouting this nonsense that the North American Union Plan doesn't exist, you are a prostitute.
[01:43:12.173 --> 01:43:18.899]  You have sold out your integrity for your paycheck.
[01:43:19.239 --> 01:43:24.584]  You are a prostitute and there is no other, I don't think there's a better word to describe that Alex.
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:31.524]  Well, I have this Wall Street Journal here saying the changing global architecture and how we need global government.
[01:43:31.624 --> 01:43:34.426]  I have Foreign Affairs saying the end of national currency.
[01:43:34.686 --> 01:43:36.527]  We need to get rid of the dollar for the Amaro.
[01:43:36.707 --> 01:43:38.589]  Yeah, what's the architecture, Alex?
[01:43:38.829 --> 01:43:39.809]  What is the architecture?
[01:43:39.829 --> 01:43:40.370]  Here's another one.
[01:43:40.410 --> 01:43:42.291]  Is the Euro the next global currency?
[01:43:42.691 --> 01:43:43.412]  And then you've got the
[01:43:43.972 --> 01:43:48.455]  You've got, this is out of the Houston Chronicle, Urban Legend of the North American Union Feeds on Fears.
[01:43:48.895 --> 01:44:01.083]  Let's specifically talk more about really Giuliani's involvement, but let's get into how this integrates with the illegal aliens, with the social security, with the merger of the regulations.
[01:44:01.103 --> 01:44:02.463]  I mean, go through your key facts.
[01:44:02.543 --> 01:44:08.127]  One of the first things I ever learned when I got into this back around, I don't know, nine or so years ago
[01:44:09.027 --> 01:44:27.100]  It's kind of like New World Order 101 is that in order to accomplish this totalitarian super state with their boot on your face forever, they have to take the United States down a few pegs in order to comfortably merge it with the rest of the P.I.
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:33.745]  By the way, I've heard them say this as if it's some wonderful liberal attribute that America is going to be brought down a standard.
[01:44:34.085 --> 01:44:36.387]  We've had it too well, but all that means is
[01:44:37.331 --> 01:44:41.236]  Getting us where we're controllable as serfs, paying into a global tax.
[01:44:41.296 --> 01:44:42.858]  It doesn't mean helping the poor.
[01:44:42.918 --> 01:44:49.705]  So they've sold the liberals that hurting America, planned economies, socialism for the elite, is how we're going to help the third world.
[01:44:49.725 --> 01:44:52.108]  When in truth it's the globalists waging war on the third world.
[01:44:52.148 --> 01:44:57.091]  And of course, what you need to do to take America down is a direct assault on the middle class.
[01:44:57.531 --> 01:45:03.834]  And again, Lou Dobbs has had this series forever about the assault on the middle class on CNN.
[01:45:04.034 --> 01:45:07.116]  Quite frankly, I don't know why they let that man run off at the mouth.
[01:45:07.376 --> 01:45:09.897]  Because he's telling the truth about the assault on the middle class.
[01:45:10.197 --> 01:45:12.118]  They've been shipping the jobs overseas.
[01:45:12.138 --> 01:45:15.420]  They've been bringing foreigners into this country to depress our wage scales.
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:20.202]  They've been bringing educated foreigners into this country to depress the higher-end wage scales.
[01:45:21.961 --> 01:45:24.322]  There's no conspiracy theory about this.
[01:45:24.422 --> 01:45:27.384]  Public, private and corporate debt is at all-time records.
[01:45:27.764 --> 01:45:31.666]  It's debasing every indicator of society, shows the standards plunging.
[01:45:31.926 --> 01:45:35.267]  And their answer is more globalization, more New World Order.
[01:45:35.327 --> 01:45:42.691]  And if you want to talk about just financial motive alone, just take that as a segment of these international banker types and these multinational corporations.
[01:45:43.111 --> 01:45:49.734]  Look at the destination of the NAFTA superhighway in the port of Lazaro Cardenas in Mexico.
[01:45:50.174 --> 01:46:11.827]  They're expanding that port to 20 times its current capacity so that Walmart, with their communist Chinese slaves, can avoid the American longshoremen, avoid the American teamsters, and get their stuff offloaded by Mexicans, and driven up into the middle of the United States by Mexican drivers, without having to touch a disgusting American who actually has a standard of living and a job?
[01:46:12.367 --> 01:46:13.888]  That's not conspiracy theory!
[01:46:13.908 --> 01:46:15.889]  That's in all the financial publications!
[01:46:16.309 --> 01:46:20.012]  Wal-Mart, Hutchison Port Holdings, the big deal down at Lazaro Cardenas.
[01:46:20.452 --> 01:46:21.733]  And you think it's a conspiracy theory?
[01:46:21.793 --> 01:46:22.433]  And there's something bigger.
[01:46:22.453 --> 01:46:27.037]  First we learned it was six ports to be given to the United Arab Emirates, UAE.
[01:46:27.077 --> 01:46:36.063]  Then we learned it was 21 ports, and then 37, and then it was basically, I mean it was every port on the major Texas coast, Florida, East Coast, it was everything!
[01:46:36.343 --> 01:46:41.711]  Yeah, but Lazaro Cardenas, this Mexican port is kind of like the poster child for this thing because it's been the most publicized.
[01:46:41.951 --> 01:46:49.982]  And of course, you know, you're watching right now Senator John Cornyn from Texas having this little pillow fight with John McCain.
[01:46:50.162 --> 01:46:51.124]  Total failure.
[01:46:51.324 --> 01:46:53.147]  It's complete garbage.
[01:46:53.727 --> 01:47:07.800]  Go look at Senate Bill 3622 that Cornyn introduced in the Congress last year, calling for American taxpayers to build the Mexican portion of this non-existent trans-Texas corridor.
[01:47:08.041 --> 01:47:08.521]  Senate Bill 3622!
[01:47:08.581 --> 01:47:09.062]  He got caught
[01:47:11.412 --> 01:47:15.496]  The language in his bill was exactly the language that's going on in our community.
[01:47:16.457 --> 01:47:24.723]  When they claim that they're cussing at each other and having fights, and, oh, because the bill's too tough on immigrants, then that fools conservatives who think it's really good, but notice the bill's secret.
[01:47:25.024 --> 01:47:26.165]  Yeah, you want to talk about it.
[01:47:26.185 --> 01:47:27.346]  Finish up what you said about Cornyn, though.
[01:47:27.506 --> 01:47:30.869]  Well, you know, Cornyn versus McCain, it's nothing but a WWF
[01:47:35.615 --> 01:47:36.376]  We're good to go.
[01:47:55.289 --> 01:47:58.250]  And people better realize the left and right are working together against the people.
[01:47:58.510 --> 01:48:03.711]  There is no left and right when you get to the higher levels of this entire government structure, and that's the key.
[01:48:03.731 --> 01:48:13.752]  Now, getting back to what I mentioned before the break, the UN article 2930, it gives you all these great rights for the global government, but then takes them all away in 2930.
[01:48:13.933 --> 01:48:18.853]  Yeah, look, this is kind of, again, it's New World Order 101.
[01:48:20.054 --> 01:48:21.834]  Go to the UN website.
[01:48:22.782 --> 01:48:24.084]  Go to the part that talks about
[01:48:35.888 --> 01:48:40.650]  Human Rights, and download, read, print out the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
[01:48:41.010 --> 01:48:45.913]  All you got to do is read it and you will realize it is nothing but sugar-coated slavery.
[01:48:46.113 --> 01:48:52.255]  This one world government they want to create is not constitutional democracy.
[01:48:52.355 --> 01:48:53.456]  It's not a republic.
[01:48:53.516 --> 01:48:55.817]  It's not limited rights for the government.
[01:48:56.137 --> 01:48:57.978]  There are no human rights
[01:48:58.038 --> 01:49:01.099]  It's a corporate wonderland to literally rape and rob and feed on the people.
[01:49:01.179 --> 01:49:04.100]  Yeah, but it sounds so good until you actually read it.
[01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:18.045]  And if you actually read it, you will find out, and again, Article 29, Section 3 is my favorite one, because the articles above, they list tons of human rights that you have under their glorious system, and then Article 29, Section 3 says, well, unless you disagree with me.
[01:49:18.812 --> 01:49:21.212]  In which case, you can't exercise those rights.
[01:49:21.413 --> 01:49:29.774]  It says, quote, these rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
[01:49:30.574 --> 01:49:34.615]  If you disagree with the U.N., you may in no case exercise your human rights.
[01:49:36.695 --> 01:49:37.276]  But the U.N.
[01:49:37.296 --> 01:49:38.016]  doesn't exist.
[01:49:38.036 --> 01:49:44.357]  Neither does the North American Union, and they're not putting toll roads on Mopac, and the tanks crashing into the Waco church was not an assault.
[01:49:45.311 --> 01:49:48.574]  And, uh, the bill is secret, but it's not an amnesty bill.
[01:49:49.495 --> 01:49:51.096]  But it will legalize all the illegal aliens.
[01:49:51.596 --> 01:49:52.257]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:59.803]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.143 --> 01:50:02.085]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.445 --> 01:50:10.071]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.774 --> 01:50:17.837]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.857 --> 01:50:29.662]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.962 --> 01:50:33.644]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.924 --> 01:50:35.885]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.185 --> 01:50:40.047]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:50:40.627 --> 01:50:48.078]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:50:54.384 --> 01:51:03.451]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:51:03.691 --> 01:51:14.919]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:15.260 --> 01:51:20.984]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:51:21.124 --> 01:51:21.564]  I don't know.
[01:51:39.138 --> 01:51:40.960]  Let's get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:41.861]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.

[01:51:42.261 --> 01:51:43.642]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:51:53.573 --> 01:51:55.294]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:55.514 --> 01:51:59.217]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:59.537 --> 01:52:01.759]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:52:02.279 --> 01:52:08.483]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:08.644 --> 01:52:13.507]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.727 --> 01:52:22.752]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[01:52:23.093 --> 01:52:29.096]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[01:52:47.515 --> 01:52:52.581]  That's NET, the number 7, tech.com, and start protecting yourself today!
[01:52:56.445 --> 01:53:11.141]  We're going to have Bob Dacey with us until the next segment and then about 8 after we're going to have Aaron Russo on for the balance of that hour.
[01:53:11.161 --> 01:53:16.347]  Getting into Ron Paul, the New World Order, the war, the amnesty plan, all of it.
[01:53:17.981 --> 01:53:27.745]  I was reading this North American Union Feeds on Fears, it's an urban legend, and it talks about Robert Pasture who says it's xenophobic to criticize immigration and globalization.
[01:53:28.546 --> 01:53:31.847]  Not that he doesn't think cooperation, sort of a merger, is a good idea.
[01:53:31.887 --> 01:53:34.949]  He testifies before Congress on improving coordination with North America.
[01:53:36.821 --> 01:53:37.701]  I keep going back to this.
[01:53:37.741 --> 01:53:41.323]  We have the SPP's first official meeting secretly in Banff.
[01:53:41.363 --> 01:53:52.307]  I mean, a secret meeting with the heads of the three governments, all the heads of the bureaucracies and agencies, and you read it, and it's corporate chieftains there telling them how to set up their agencies.
[01:53:52.887 --> 01:53:58.589]  And again, microcosm, Texas Department of Transportation tells the legislature, you can't see our agreement.
[01:53:58.829 --> 01:54:00.670]  This is high treason!
[01:54:00.710 --> 01:54:04.211]  They're involved in treason, and of course these bastards, excuse my
[01:54:04.969 --> 01:54:06.452]  I'm not using that term, but they are bastards.
[01:54:07.213 --> 01:54:09.236]  I don't mean that spiritually.
[01:54:09.256 --> 01:54:13.062]  Of course they're lying about their treason.
[01:54:13.663 --> 01:54:15.366]  Because they know if we find out, we're going to stop them.
[01:54:15.959 --> 01:54:20.022]  Well, you know, Robert Pastor meets the classic definition of a traitor.
[01:54:20.082 --> 01:54:24.326]  I'm sorry, Professor Pastor, you are a traitor to your country.
[01:54:25.287 --> 01:54:26.107]  You should be arrested.
[01:54:26.127 --> 01:54:27.028]  You should be arrested.
[01:54:27.909 --> 01:54:36.836]  All the evidence against you for selling out the United States of America to try to merge us with a narco state, on the face of it is insane.
[01:54:37.117 --> 01:54:44.923]  But since you promote it so readily, and since you were the chief author of Building a North American Community, you should be arrested, sir, because you are a traitor.
[01:54:45.003 --> 01:54:45.303]  I think so.
[01:55:02.114 --> 01:55:07.698]  And you've got to love it, you know, they say that when we're against a war, or we're against the Federal Reserve, we're traitors, you're not supposed to criticize... No!
[01:55:08.159 --> 01:55:23.350]  Americans are supposed to criticize the government, and Americans have free speech, but when you try to write stuff up, and you organize secret meetings with governments to, without the people's input or Congress's input, destroy the country, that is high treason, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:27.073]  You know, back in 2005, I... By the way, high treason is different from treason.
[01:55:27.742 --> 01:55:28.883]  It's higher than regular treason.
[01:55:29.623 --> 01:55:34.207]  It's punishable by very serious issues if you're found guilty of that.
[01:55:34.427 --> 01:55:38.189]  And that's because high treason is actually trying to imperil the nation itself.
[01:55:38.389 --> 01:55:39.330]  Well, that's what he's doing.
[01:55:40.191 --> 01:55:45.054]  When you try to dismantle the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, you are imperiling the nation.
[01:55:45.074 --> 01:55:45.855]  It's prima facie.
[01:55:45.975 --> 01:55:47.216]  He is guilty of high treason.
[01:55:47.256 --> 01:55:51.058]  You know, when I attended that conference at Baylor back in 2005,
[01:55:52.603 --> 01:55:56.626]  There was a press conference there, and I was one of the only two reporters that showed up.
[01:55:57.087 --> 01:55:59.789]  One was a board person from the Houston Chronicle, and the other one was me.
[01:55:59.809 --> 01:56:13.719]  And I got to ask Dr. Supachai Panachpakhne of the WTO about this free trade of the Americas, and what about the American Constitution, and what about Article 1, Section 8, that only Congress can regulate all this for you?
[01:56:13.739 --> 01:56:15.100]  Article 1, Section 8 doesn't exist.
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:16.381]  The Constitution doesn't exist.
[01:56:16.401 --> 01:56:17.562]  You're a liar.
[01:56:17.602 --> 01:56:18.063]  None of it exists.
[01:56:18.083 --> 01:56:21.005]  I asked him if it was in the way of his North American Union,
[01:56:21.585 --> 01:56:28.930]  His Free Trade of the Americas, and after he bumbled around a little while, he said, no, it's not in our way.
[01:56:29.250 --> 01:56:31.312]  And at the time, I didn't realize what he meant.
[01:56:31.552 --> 01:56:33.813]  But what he meant is, look what's going on.
[01:56:33.973 --> 01:56:38.236]  They're completely bypassing the United States Congress in this North American Union.
[01:56:38.276 --> 01:56:39.257]  They just ordered the Barack.
[01:56:39.277 --> 01:56:40.498]  Well, the legislatures.
[01:56:40.838 --> 01:56:41.438]  Just forget it.
[01:56:41.559 --> 01:56:46.142]  In Indiana, in Kansas, in New York, the legislatures aren't for it.
[01:56:46.162 --> 01:56:47.983]  They just go, you're not allowed to see the agreement.
[01:56:48.743 --> 01:56:49.704]  This is the government.
[01:56:50.285 --> 01:56:52.409]  I mean, do the police understand what they're hearing?
[01:56:52.869 --> 01:56:53.030]  Yeah.
[01:56:53.050 --> 01:56:54.071]  I mean, you don't have to believe me.
[01:56:54.111 --> 01:56:58.218]  Just type in, Centra Text-Out Agreement Secret from State into Google.
[01:56:58.238 --> 01:56:59.260]  You'll get hundreds of articles.
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:02.946]  But when we get back in the final segment, Bob, I want to talk about solutions and
[01:57:04.048 --> 01:57:07.651]  Santa Fe Police Department looking into hiring Mexican nationals.
[01:57:07.671 --> 01:57:08.832]  That's the Associated Press.
[01:57:08.872 --> 01:57:09.593]  And then I have this.
[01:57:09.693 --> 01:57:09.873]  U.S.
[01:57:09.913 --> 01:57:16.618]  military may recruit foreigners, but then the next thing says, struggling to fill its ranks, it may recruit more non-U.S.
[01:57:16.638 --> 01:57:17.019]  citizens.
[01:57:17.059 --> 01:57:18.360]  They've already been doing it for years.
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:22.143]  Well, there is one advantage to that article about hiring Mexican police people.
[01:57:22.363 --> 01:57:23.484]  There is one advantage to that.
[01:57:23.604 --> 01:57:25.285]  Oh, we'll learn about the advantage when we get back.
[01:57:25.426 --> 01:57:25.726]  Alright.
[01:57:25.766 --> 01:57:27.427]  But I've got an email saying I'm a liar.
[01:57:27.467 --> 01:57:28.448]  This article isn't real.
[01:57:28.768 --> 01:57:30.209]  People can't even face this, Bob.
[01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.770]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:33.869 --> 01:57:38.092]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.873 --> 01:57:50.493]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.173 --> 01:57:52.234]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.934 --> 01:57:54.054]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.694 --> 01:57:55.515]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.255 --> 01:57:57.255]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.836 --> 01:58:01.457]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.017 --> 01:58:06.139]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.119 --> 01:58:13.862]  Well, Robert Pastor is guilty of high treason against the United States, trying to overthrow America, actively doing it.
[01:58:13.922 --> 01:58:14.942]  That is high treason.
[01:58:15.891 --> 01:58:19.253]  And now, Santa Fe Police Department looking into hiring Mexican nationals.
[01:58:19.553 --> 01:58:21.534]  Associated Press, they say the military's doing it.
[01:58:21.974 --> 01:58:22.495]  Why not?
[01:58:22.855 --> 01:58:27.417]  And then we have the articles, right here, where it says, struggling to fill its depleted ranks, the U.S.
[01:58:27.997 --> 01:58:29.238]  American citizenry, the U.S.
[01:58:29.278 --> 01:58:30.999]  military, is considering recruiting more.
[01:58:31.779 --> 01:58:34.861]  20 plus percent of the troops in the Army and Iraq are illegal aliens, now legal.
[01:58:35.741 --> 01:58:36.802]  More non-U.S.
[01:58:36.822 --> 01:58:38.563]  citizens, according to Pentagon officials.
[01:58:39.766 --> 01:58:42.489]  You see, it's all happening.
[01:58:42.829 --> 01:58:45.171]  This integration by stealth is happening.
[01:58:45.411 --> 01:58:53.439]  But Bob, in the last segment you were around the time to say that you were saying there's an advantage to having Mexican police on the streets of America.
[01:58:53.579 --> 01:58:54.059]  Absolutely.
[01:58:54.099 --> 01:58:58.023]  There is one advantage to having Mexican police on the streets of America.
[01:58:58.579 --> 01:59:05.785]  Especially on the highways, because if you get pulled over for speeding by a Mexican cop, all you gotta do is take out 50 bucks and the ticket goes away.
[01:59:05.805 --> 01:59:10.028]  I mean, everybody knows everything in Mexico is paid for with a bribe.
[01:59:11.009 --> 01:59:12.931]  And by the way, you're not supposed to say that.
[01:59:13.331 --> 01:59:15.333]  That's just people trying to neutralize our free speech.
[01:59:15.833 --> 01:59:23.199]  I have seen my father, when we would be on trips in Mexico, where they would pull you over and just walk over and say, I need a tip.
[01:59:23.937 --> 01:59:28.418]  Okay, and I mean, I have personally, my shelf, paid off Mexican police.
[01:59:28.618 --> 01:59:35.720]  Several years ago, there was a guy at the gun show that made the mistake of crossing the border into Mexico with a box of 22 shells on his truck.
[01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:36.160]  Oh, I remember that.
[01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:36.780]  Remember that?
[01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:38.100]  They sucked his family dry.
[01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:47.382]  I called up my congressman, Lloyd Doggett at the time, and spoke to his representative about what do we do to get this guy out of this Mexican jail, and Lloyd Doggett's
[01:59:47.962 --> 01:59:51.406]  A man told me, you know what you have to do to get him out of Mexican jail.
[01:59:51.426 --> 01:59:52.788]  You gotta pay off people.
[01:59:53.388 --> 01:59:54.570]  Everybody knows it!
[01:59:55.191 --> 01:59:55.831]  Everybody knows it.
[01:59:56.051 --> 02:00:02.533]  What they do now is if they find you with a big truck or nice stuff, they'll find under the seat a 22 case.
[02:00:02.833 --> 02:00:08.795]  In one case they sucked over a hundred grand out of a family because they run credit checks on you now when they get you.
[02:00:09.835 --> 02:00:17.937]  I mean, listen folks, it's not unusual in Mexico to literally see cops drunk with whiskey bottles in their hands just walking around grabbing on women.
[02:00:18.397 --> 02:00:20.158]  I mean, I guess this is the new America.
[02:00:20.638 --> 02:00:23.859]  Everybody knows that Mexico is a crookocracy.
[02:00:24.668 --> 02:00:25.788]  A kleptocracy, yeah.
[02:00:25.889 --> 02:00:28.229]  A crookocracy, kleptocracy, whatever you want to call it.
[02:00:28.449 --> 02:00:31.090]  And Robert Pastor thinks we should merge with that.
[02:00:31.391 --> 02:00:32.491]  Hey, brilliant guy.
[02:00:33.471 --> 02:00:34.392]  Absolutely brilliant.
[02:00:34.952 --> 02:00:36.012]  Well, it's perfect for them.
[02:00:36.032 --> 02:00:37.493]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[02:00:37.513 --> 02:00:38.493]  This is the new world order.
[02:00:38.993 --> 02:00:40.574]  Six plus billion third world people.
[02:00:40.794 --> 02:00:44.555]  I mean, nothing against them, but it's more like a lifeboat that can take 20 people.
[02:00:44.576 --> 02:00:45.116]  We already got 100 in it.
[02:00:46.267 --> 02:00:48.048]  And basically, America's already bankrupt.
[02:00:48.069 --> 02:00:53.873]  You know, an illegal takes close to three times in social services what they pay in taxes.
[02:00:54.033 --> 02:00:54.994]  And that's federal numbers.
[02:00:55.494 --> 02:00:57.616]  But they keep saying, we need them, we need them for the economy.
[02:00:58.196 --> 02:00:59.477]  The states are already bankrupt!
[02:00:59.877 --> 02:01:02.499]  Alex, I would like to know, I'm confused.
[02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:09.124]  I want to know how, in 1954, American lawns got mowed and roofs got put on houses.
[02:01:09.204 --> 02:01:10.485]  How did that happen?
[02:01:10.505 --> 02:01:13.808]  The conventional wisdom now is
[02:01:14.486 --> 02:01:16.227]  Americans cannot do these things.
[02:01:16.267 --> 02:01:17.428]  No, no, Easter bunnies did it.
[02:01:17.828 --> 02:01:25.392]  Oh, I was wondering because apparently America did manage to get along with American workers for many, many, many decades.
[02:01:25.432 --> 02:01:34.497]  But back then, you could put a family through college and live pretty good, run a roofing company.
[02:01:34.617 --> 02:01:35.277]  Now you can't.
[02:01:35.377 --> 02:01:38.259]  The wage scale wasn't artificially depressed by
[02:01:39.339 --> 02:01:42.181]  Slave labor coming in from across another border?
[02:01:42.261 --> 02:01:44.142]  Is that the way it worked back then?
[02:01:44.262 --> 02:01:44.963]  Oh, it's wonderful.
[02:01:44.983 --> 02:01:46.123]  We have to have more illegals.
[02:01:46.203 --> 02:01:52.707]  What can we do without having to pay the average of $12,000 per baby and then the three welfare checks per person on average?
[02:01:53.068 --> 02:01:55.129]  I love the way that they set up that situation.
[02:01:55.149 --> 02:01:58.371]  They say they do jobs Americans won't do.
[02:01:58.611 --> 02:02:03.554]  No, they do jobs for a pay scale that Americans can't afford to do.
[02:02:03.614 --> 02:02:04.435]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[02:02:04.475 --> 02:02:05.395]  Keep calling the Senate.
[02:02:05.415 --> 02:02:06.296]  Keep calling the House.
[02:02:06.836 --> 02:02:15.203]  They have announced today that they're withdrawing it, but for only a week to two weeks, admitting they're going to try to sneak it through, and we'll just wake up one day and hear they passed it.
[02:02:15.663 --> 02:02:16.224]  Get ready.
[02:02:16.544 --> 02:02:17.224]  They're traitors.
[02:02:17.324 --> 02:02:20.947]  It's a secret bill, like everything else is secret, with these traitors.
[02:02:21.448 --> 02:02:23.329]  Marlon Specter's guilty of high treason.
[02:02:23.770 --> 02:02:25.411]  Ted Kennedy's guilty of high treason.
[02:02:25.731 --> 02:02:27.492]  George Bush is guilty of high treason.
[02:02:27.773 --> 02:02:29.494]  Robert Pastor's guilty of high treason.
[02:02:29.994 --> 02:02:33.077]  Every single one of them trying to destroy America, period.
[02:02:33.695 --> 02:02:36.576]  He's guilty of high treason, and that's just the way it is.
[02:02:37.517 --> 02:02:41.879]  In fact, that's what the British Prime Minister said back when the Bilderberg Group wanted to get rid of England's sovereignty.
[02:02:42.259 --> 02:02:43.299]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:53.984]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.345 --> 02:03:01.948]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.668 --> 02:03:09.730]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.111 --> 02:03:21.534]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.854 --> 02:03:25.416]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.816 --> 02:03:27.756]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.077 --> 02:03:31.918]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:06:25.666 --> 02:06:41.731]  Aaron Russo is our guest for the rest of the hour, and Bob Dacey is going to ride shotgun for just a couple more segments with us, as well as we talk about Ron Paul, how they're trying to censor him, how they're trying to block him, the victories, by the grace of God, and your action that we've had.
[02:06:43.101 --> 02:06:49.124]  The open calls for more of our troops to be made up of foreigners who are legalized to join the military.
[02:06:49.744 --> 02:06:52.925]  Now open talk of hiring Mexican police to patrol the United States.
[02:06:52.945 --> 02:06:55.746]  They've had these interchange programs, exchange programs for a long time.
[02:06:56.187 --> 02:06:58.468]  Now they're officially talking about doing it.
[02:06:59.108 --> 02:07:00.468]  What's happening with the war.
[02:07:01.009 --> 02:07:06.051]  Also the Senate saying they're going to drop the amnesty for a week or two and then secretly try to pass it.
[02:07:06.431 --> 02:07:06.971]  Hey, thanks Alex.
[02:07:06.991 --> 02:07:08.732]  It's a pleasure to be here, and let me tell you something.
[02:07:33.966 --> 02:07:36.682]  Chance is a cakewalk, that's what we gotta face with the government.
[02:07:37.483 --> 02:07:37.923]  Okay.
[02:07:38.043 --> 02:07:39.204]  I mean, hell with the cancer.
[02:07:39.224 --> 02:07:40.665]  What we have to face is the government.
[02:07:41.025 --> 02:07:43.126]  I know, but I just want folks to know that you're a real trooper.
[02:07:43.667 --> 02:07:47.369]  And I appreciate Heidi letting you do these interviews.
[02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:51.911]  Well, it is a little bit of a struggle, honestly, with her.
[02:07:53.032 --> 02:07:53.993]  How's your family doing?
[02:07:54.593 --> 02:07:55.373]  My family's great.
[02:07:55.413 --> 02:07:56.954]  You know, they love me and I love them.
[02:07:56.994 --> 02:07:58.275]  I have a wonderful family.
[02:07:58.335 --> 02:07:59.856]  And how's Shockey the dog?
[02:08:00.536 --> 02:08:01.517]  Ah, you remember Shockey?
[02:08:01.557 --> 02:08:03.558]  Shockey's the coolest little dog.
[02:08:04.058 --> 02:08:05.079]  My family is great.
[02:08:05.119 --> 02:08:06.180]  I have a great family life.
[02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:06.760]  The problem
[02:08:07.515 --> 02:08:15.379]  We all face the problem of this government going wild, going crazy, destroying our lives, and the future is really bleak.
[02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:19.342]  I want to hear what you have to say about the victory we had.
[02:08:19.402 --> 02:08:25.505]  Elaborate on that, because that's a big deal, how they tried to ban and bar Ron Paul, and where you see this campaign going.
[02:08:25.545 --> 02:08:27.326]  And then Bob Dacey's here.
[02:08:27.366 --> 02:08:32.649]  He wanted to also comment on the solution and Ron Paul, and how big a piece of the puzzle that is.
[02:08:32.669 --> 02:08:34.210]  But Aaron, you've got the floor.
[02:08:34.470 --> 02:08:36.271]  Lay out what we're facing here with Ron Paul.
[02:08:37.102 --> 02:08:43.764]  Well, with Ron Paul, I think we have a hero in our corner that mostly everybody who has any sense will get behind.
[02:08:44.624 --> 02:08:46.485]  And so that's a big plus for us.
[02:08:46.525 --> 02:08:47.305]  We haven't had that.
[02:08:47.365 --> 02:08:50.106]  We've not had anybody in the debates before.
[02:08:50.586 --> 02:08:58.408]  And so having that is something that for people who believe in the freedom movement, as you and I both do, is unique.
[02:08:59.129 --> 02:09:00.229]  And we can't lose that.
[02:09:00.409 --> 02:09:06.831]  And they saw the effect that it had on the debates the other night, because we won those polls.
[02:09:07.729 --> 02:09:12.731]  And the fact of the matter happens to be whether they were accurate or not doesn't matter.
[02:09:12.771 --> 02:09:18.033]  What matters is they see that there's a groundswell for Ron Paul and that it can build.
[02:09:18.593 --> 02:09:24.275]  And that the light that Ron Paul shines on America is a light that's going to attract a lot of people.
[02:09:24.896 --> 02:09:27.097]  And so we have to make sure that he stays on the base.
[02:09:27.157 --> 02:09:29.878]  And I think the other day we did a very good job of doing that.
[02:09:30.758 --> 02:09:36.080]  And at this point, I mean, I said I spoke to Ron.
[02:09:36.938 --> 02:09:42.520]  And I think what Ron has to do right now is go after Rudy Giuliani.
[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:53.343]  I think the way the press played what happened in the last debate is they made it out to be as if Ron Paul gave Rudy Giuliani the election.
[02:09:54.183 --> 02:09:55.264]  And they handed him a gift.
[02:09:56.184 --> 02:09:58.525]  And that's the spin they chose to put on it.
[02:09:59.165 --> 02:10:03.326]  But if you understand the press and how things really work in this country, it's the other way around.
[02:10:03.866 --> 02:10:05.807]  Giuliani gave Ron Paul a gift.
[02:10:06.494 --> 02:10:10.536]  And if Ron Paul, um, that's what he has to do now.
[02:10:10.556 --> 02:10:17.378]  See, what, what, what, what, what Rudy Giuliani did is he put Ron Paul's name on the list of people who never heard of Ron Paul before.
[02:10:18.159 --> 02:10:21.120]  He gave him tremendous, uh, uh, awareness.
[02:10:21.826 --> 02:10:23.606]  I mean, they're even talking about him on their view, right?
[02:10:23.626 --> 02:10:25.547]  I heard it again yesterday, I heard it last week.
[02:10:26.007 --> 02:10:28.147]  He's going to be back on Bill Maher this Friday night?
[02:10:28.647 --> 02:10:30.628]  He's going to be back on Bill Maher, all that.
[02:10:30.668 --> 02:10:33.148]  He's getting tremendous press out of it.
[02:10:33.488 --> 02:10:37.949]  What he's got to do now is, in the next debate, he has to go after Rudy Giuliani.
[02:10:38.509 --> 02:10:42.190]  Because Rudy opened the door for Ron to go after him now.
[02:10:42.210 --> 02:10:43.470]  I agree with you.
[02:10:43.490 --> 02:10:49.211]  I think he needs to go after Rudolph Giuliani even before the debate to grab those headlines again.
[02:10:49.231 --> 02:10:51.572]  He's not going to get the headlines unless he's on the debate.
[02:10:52.661 --> 02:10:58.407]  You see, him going after Rudy Giuliani and putting out a press release or whatever, they're not going to write about that.
[02:10:58.467 --> 02:11:02.290]  But if it's on the national debates, that everywhere in the world is watching.
[02:11:02.630 --> 02:11:06.014]  Now obviously he's a smart guy, Dr. Paul's smart, but so are you politically.
[02:11:06.434 --> 02:11:07.575]  Did you give him that advice?
[02:11:07.855 --> 02:11:08.116]  Yes.
[02:11:09.076 --> 02:11:18.125]  And the point is that by going after Rudy Giuliani in the next debates, that's going to be the flashpoint that the press is going to write about the next day.
[02:11:18.965 --> 02:11:33.314]  In other words, except for my talking on the air now and giving them the strategy, but the fact is that when people walk away from that debate, if one attacks Rudy properly in a smart way, the press is going to be all about it.
[02:11:33.354 --> 02:11:36.116]  In other words, it's not just Rudy Giuliani attacking Ron Paul.
[02:11:36.496 --> 02:11:39.038]  Ron Paul can speak at a turn and attack Giuliani.
[02:11:39.719 --> 02:11:42.542]  I think you should go after Giuliani on how he's profiteered off 9-11.
[02:11:42.562 --> 02:11:47.767]  I would come out and say, you know, you helped cover up the toxic dust, and that's now been documented, and you give an example.
[02:11:59.589 --> 02:12:06.851]  And you have made over 50 million dollars, you can get the numbers, it's actually more than that, off of out pimping yourself as a hero on 9-11.
[02:12:07.631 --> 02:12:09.452]  Why have you profiteered from 9-11?
[02:12:09.512 --> 02:12:12.032]  My gosh, that'll explode like a supernova.
[02:12:12.933 --> 02:12:16.914]  That's a decision Roy has to make, what he's comfortable talking about, you know?
[02:12:17.594 --> 02:12:20.495]  I know he's not a nasty, mean person, but this is war.
[02:12:20.755 --> 02:12:22.595]  He needs to go directly for Giuliani's throat.
[02:12:22.815 --> 02:12:25.216]  Exactly, and only Giuliani.
[02:12:25.576 --> 02:12:28.377]  Because the truth of the matter happens to be,
[02:12:29.042 --> 02:12:31.304]  There's no one there and no one cares about McCain.
[02:12:31.744 --> 02:12:33.165]  Romney's getting some press.
[02:12:33.525 --> 02:12:36.347]  But the fact is, if you get rid of Giuliani and Rom does that...
[02:12:36.980 --> 02:12:43.684]  Then why 12 on everybody's list as a possible contender that will actually be taken seriously for the first time.
[02:12:43.724 --> 02:12:48.587]  Bob Dasing, Alex and Aaron, nice to meet you even if it's over the radio waves here.
[02:12:48.867 --> 02:12:49.447]  Hello Bob.
[02:12:50.308 --> 02:12:52.689]  I'm honored to be on the same show with you at the same time.
[02:12:52.789 --> 02:13:00.414]  Listen, another thing I think he needs to do to go after Giuliani is to show the conservatives of America that Giuliani is not a Republican.
[02:13:00.934 --> 02:13:04.696]  He's a flaming liberal in so-called Republican guise.
[02:13:04.856 --> 02:13:07.038]  But that's been done so many times already.
[02:13:07.058 --> 02:13:07.898]  There's nothing new there.
[02:13:09.159 --> 02:13:10.860]  A lot of Republicans don't know it.
[02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:13.821]  The press has written that.
[02:13:13.841 --> 02:13:14.922]  You have so many issues.
[02:13:15.002 --> 02:13:17.363]  The abortion issue, the immigration issue.
[02:13:17.423 --> 02:13:18.284]  You have so many issues.
[02:13:18.804 --> 02:13:23.148]  Well, he's not been strictly a Republican conservative, but it's been written about so much already.
[02:13:23.288 --> 02:13:26.170]  Yeah, but they've also... You can't keep beating the same horse.
[02:13:26.190 --> 02:13:32.295]  They've also said that Ron Paul has left the reservation on the Republican Party when the fact of the matter is it's the other way around.
[02:13:32.336 --> 02:13:35.598]  The Republican elites have left the mainstream.
[02:13:36.379 --> 02:13:41.163]  I agree with that, but I'm just trying to tell you the first time, you can only make a first impression the first time.
[02:13:41.852 --> 02:13:51.196]  Well, they've had polls in New York where over 75% of the firefighters and police hate Giuliani for the dust and everything else he did.
[02:13:51.216 --> 02:13:55.618]  I think hitting him with that's good, but also another volley, you know, that he's not a real conservative.
[02:13:56.918 --> 02:14:03.901]  Because bottom line, and what Aaron's saying is the key, he's got to go for the juggler and I told him the same thing.
[02:14:05.371 --> 02:14:06.191]  His campaign is the same thing.
[02:14:06.211 --> 02:14:10.292]  He's coming on next Tuesday after the holiday with us here in the second hour.
[02:14:10.812 --> 02:14:11.572]  The Congressman is.
[02:14:13.093 --> 02:14:16.453]  But looking at this, it's just like Ross Perot.
[02:14:16.853 --> 02:14:18.654]  But he was nothing compared to Ron Paul.
[02:14:18.674 --> 02:14:21.014]  I mean, Ron Paul is literally founding father material.
[02:14:21.074 --> 02:14:29.436]  He is just a last hope at a presidential campaign level to save this and to really try to keep this from going into a bloody revolution as Aaron said a few days ago here.
[02:14:31.673 --> 02:14:40.558]  Ron Paul is the only candidate who can really beat Hillary, and he does have popular appeal across the board, and Ron Paul is gaining momentum, and they're scared to death.
[02:14:40.578 --> 02:14:43.540]  We're dealing with nitroglycerin here, my friends.
[02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:54.727]  Ron Paul is one step away from being able to actually be catapulted in, and he's one of the number one search terms on the internet for now over a week running, and he could end up being the Republican nominee.
[02:14:55.027 --> 02:14:56.248]  Let's jump ahead, Aaron.
[02:14:56.268 --> 02:14:59.630]  There's no question, but I think an awful lot.
[02:15:00.256 --> 02:15:01.616]  Depends upon the next debate.
[02:15:02.457 --> 02:15:04.377]  And what Ron does in the next debate.
[02:15:05.037 --> 02:15:08.918]  And it's my opinion they're going to try and bury him in the next debate and not give him much time.
[02:15:08.958 --> 02:15:12.139]  Yeah, they're going to attack, they're going to swarm him with questions, but that backfires too.
[02:15:12.419 --> 02:15:21.922]  And don't think for a minute that just because the Republicans said they're not trying to ban him now, with the head of GOPAC and the head of Michigan and Michelle Malkin saying banning, they could still try something as well.
[02:15:22.598 --> 02:15:27.240]  Listen, you're dealing with the worst people on the face of the earth, okay?
[02:15:27.260 --> 02:15:29.681]  So I have no doubt what they're willing to do.
[02:15:29.761 --> 02:15:32.762]  It's up to us to make sure it doesn't happen.
[02:15:32.782 --> 02:15:39.244]  Well, I'll bet you a damn good donut that that Giuliani Fox News thing was a set-up from... Oh, you can tell it was scripted.
[02:15:39.264 --> 02:15:39.584]  Absolutely.
[02:15:40.585 --> 02:15:42.347]  I wouldn't doubt that.
[02:15:42.387 --> 02:15:43.928]  He's the attorney.
[02:15:44.249 --> 02:15:46.331]  He was the attorney for them, wasn't he?
[02:15:46.431 --> 02:15:48.714]  Yeah, he had that question all ready to go.
[02:15:48.734 --> 02:15:50.275]  That's right, he works for Fox News.
[02:15:50.596 --> 02:15:55.841]  And then he launched on with that false indignation thing.
[02:15:55.902 --> 02:15:57.323]  It was fake from the beginning.
[02:15:58.865 --> 02:15:59.686]  Yeah, but that's the game.
[02:15:59.766 --> 02:16:00.466]  They're all actors.
[02:16:01.195 --> 02:16:05.376]  But we have a series of liars and cheats and thieves in government.
[02:16:05.596 --> 02:16:07.396]  And that's why Ron Paul is so refreshing.
[02:16:07.436 --> 02:16:08.376]  People can see it.
[02:16:08.416 --> 02:16:09.837]  He's the real deal.
[02:16:10.077 --> 02:16:11.117]  There's no actor there.
[02:16:11.397 --> 02:16:13.057]  That's a constitutionalist.
[02:16:13.077 --> 02:16:13.937]  That's an American.
[02:16:14.317 --> 02:16:16.338]  And the rest of them are a bunch of posers.
[02:16:16.438 --> 02:16:23.659]  He's a servant, not an official or an authority who calls us civilians with martial law nomenclature.
[02:16:24.219 --> 02:16:24.799]  Exactly.
[02:16:25.279 --> 02:16:27.920]  When we get back, Bob Dacey and Aaron Morris, I want to ask you both.
[02:16:28.650 --> 02:16:29.611]  Let's shoot ahead here.
[02:16:29.631 --> 02:16:31.453]  Let's say he wins this next debate.
[02:16:31.494 --> 02:16:34.037]  He becomes even more of a prominent candidate.
[02:16:34.337 --> 02:16:37.280]  Of course, they're blocking him out of most of the national polls.
[02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:41.505]  That's why they say he doesn't show up in the polls, because he's been in five polls out of thirty-something.
[02:16:42.066 --> 02:16:48.454]  If we're able to force him now into the polls by contacting these polling agencies, let's say he is poised to win New Hampshire or Ohio.
[02:16:49.054 --> 02:16:50.515]  Well, I happen to be a Jewish guy myself.
[02:17:12.802 --> 02:17:16.264]  I'll go anywhere in the world to back Ron Paul from being an anti-Semite.
[02:17:16.484 --> 02:17:18.185]  They call me an anti-Semite, okay?
[02:17:18.805 --> 02:17:19.985]  I mean, to be a Jew.
[02:17:20.045 --> 02:17:25.448]  But, beside the point, I think what they're going to try and do is something different.
[02:17:25.468 --> 02:17:28.649]  I think what they're going to try and do is move the debate up.
[02:17:28.730 --> 02:17:32.611]  In other words, let's say Ron Paul starts winning, you know, Hampshire, Iowa, things like that.
[02:17:32.631 --> 02:17:33.052]  Stay there.
[02:17:33.092 --> 02:17:34.012]  Stay there with the analysis.
[02:17:34.052 --> 02:17:39.254]  On the other side, with Aaron Russo, the Director of America Freedom to Fascism, and Bob Basie.
[02:17:39.575 --> 02:17:40.375]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:17:45.709 --> 02:17:50.013]  If you've ever wanted to grow the absolute best tasting fruits and vegetables imaginable, here's some exciting news.
[02:17:50.214 --> 02:17:52.896]  There's a new product designed to make growing delicious produce easy.
[02:17:53.077 --> 02:17:55.479]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's dynamite in the garden.
[02:17:55.699 --> 02:18:02.466]  Proto-Gro is a bioactive superfood for plants that works by providing true broad-spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their full genetic expression.
[02:18:02.726 --> 02:18:03.846]  What does this mean in the garden?
[02:18:03.926 --> 02:18:15.229]  It means mouth-watering fruits and vegetables, brilliantly colored flowers, herbs that finally grow to medicinal strength, blue ribbon garden produce jam-packed with bioavailable minerals and trace elements, giant pumpkins, even high-potency hybrids wheatgrass.
[02:18:15.309 --> 02:18:18.350]  Proto-Gro is a proprietary blend of full-spectrum nutrients from the sea.
[02:18:18.490 --> 02:18:21.091]  It literally contains the basic building blocks of life itself.
[02:18:21.311 --> 02:18:28.293]  In fact, Proto-Gro is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record time that it almost forces plants to grow even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[02:18:28.593 --> 02:18:33.256]  It's also perfect for growing your own survival foods and might just be the ultimate hard times barter item.

[02:18:45.433 --> 02:18:45.873]  Gold.
[02:18:46.213 --> 02:18:47.494]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:18:47.754 --> 02:18:53.836]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:18:54.036 --> 02:18:57.837]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:18:58.197 --> 02:19:00.078]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:19:00.138 --> 02:19:02.419]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:19:02.579 --> 02:19:09.221]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weak
[02:19:09.241 --> 02:19:09.681]  We're good.

[02:19:45.097 --> 02:19:48.259]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:19:48.299 --> 02:19:52.342]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:19:52.462 --> 02:19:55.044]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:19:55.104 --> 02:19:57.426]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:19:57.606 --> 02:20:06.052]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:20:06.132 --> 02:20:07.433]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:20:07.573 --> 02:20:11.596]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:20:11.616 --> 02:20:12.076]  We're good to go!

[02:21:37.901 --> 02:21:38.922]  Do it today!
[02:21:38.962 --> 02:21:43.104]  We're looking at the strategy to attack Ron Paul.
[02:21:43.144 --> 02:21:47.787]  It was a foregone conclusion, mudslinging, lying.
[02:21:56.620 --> 02:22:00.444]  As he continues to rise, which is inevitable, you can see the momentum.
[02:22:02.025 --> 02:22:06.349]  He's been all over NPR, ABC Nightly News, everywhere they're talking about him.
[02:22:08.351 --> 02:22:14.636]  Just three, four weeks ago, no one was even discussing the possibility that he could get the Republican nomination.
[02:22:15.257 --> 02:22:19.641]  Aaron Russo, if he continues to win the debates, and if he takes your advice, there's no doubt he will,
[02:22:21.185 --> 02:22:23.406]  Well, in my view what's going to happen is real simple.
[02:22:41.081 --> 02:22:41.841]  Is what they're going to do.
[02:22:41.862 --> 02:22:48.725]  If he starts emerging further and further, you're going to see more of the big states pushing their primaries up earlier in the year.
[02:22:48.745 --> 02:22:52.027]  So there's no time to raise money for Ron Paul to compete.
[02:22:52.388 --> 02:22:54.309]  He has no money compared to the other guys.
[02:22:54.929 --> 02:23:02.593]  And so, if what happens happens, as we hope, they're going to start moving their primaries way up earlier in the year.
[02:23:02.613 --> 02:23:07.016]  And so that Ron won't have the money to compete with them in those primaries.
[02:23:07.728 --> 02:23:10.955]  And that's a tactic they'll use first and foremost.
[02:23:12.212 --> 02:23:15.653]  Because then you can't go have fights in each state for listeners that don't understand that.
[02:23:15.933 --> 02:23:21.874]  Then it's all at once, so that is better for the big money candidates like Giuliani with hundreds of millions.
[02:23:22.214 --> 02:23:29.915]  Yeah, I mean, if you've got hundreds of millions of dollars put away, as opposed to having a million or two million dollars, he can't run ad campaigns all across the country.
[02:23:29.975 --> 02:23:35.316]  You just run punk piece ad campaigns that... And he can't hire the staff he needs everywhere.
[02:23:35.336 --> 02:23:38.437]  He can't put the organization up that he needs everywhere.
[02:23:39.236 --> 02:23:42.138]  And so the problem is going to be that they're going to get him on the money.
[02:23:42.398 --> 02:23:45.179]  Okay, so what does that mean now to all the listeners of Alex Jones?
[02:23:45.219 --> 02:23:46.000]  What does that mean?
[02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:47.721]  Ron Paul needs money now, right?
[02:23:47.741 --> 02:23:48.361]  Oh yeah, of course.
[02:23:48.441 --> 02:23:48.981]  Absolutely.
[02:23:49.001 --> 02:23:49.802]  You hear that, everybody?
[02:23:49.862 --> 02:23:51.683]  Ron Paul needs money now, not later.
[02:23:51.883 --> 02:23:52.103]  Now.
[02:23:52.143 --> 02:23:52.503]  That's right.
[02:23:52.523 --> 02:23:53.364]  He needs money now.
[02:23:53.404 --> 02:23:54.905]  We need to build him up a war chest.
[02:23:54.985 --> 02:23:55.365]  That's right.
[02:23:55.385 --> 02:23:58.366]  Because that's going to be what they use to get him out of there.
[02:23:58.406 --> 02:24:02.809]  Besides, of course, all the derogatory articles, but right, all the other things are right.
[02:24:02.829 --> 02:24:03.889]  1-800-RON-PAUL.
[02:24:03.929 --> 02:24:06.831]  And even if you don't think he has a snowball's chance in Helladown and he's put
[02:24:07.406 --> 02:24:14.893]  Because his soul, his treasure, his blood, where his mouth is, he's out on the arena and we need to be out there with him.
[02:24:14.913 --> 02:24:16.454]  1-800-RonPaul, 1-800-RonPaul.
[02:24:17.075 --> 02:24:17.455]  Exactly.
[02:24:17.475 --> 02:24:18.797]  We have to stand behind the guy.
[02:24:19.037 --> 02:24:22.840]  We have somebody standing up for us, you know, and we have to stand behind him.
[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:28.365]  I mean, the truth is, in my mind, and I'm pretty good at these things, it's now or never.
[02:24:28.806 --> 02:24:29.767]  We're facing it, folks.
[02:24:29.847 --> 02:24:31.148]  It's staring us right in the face.
[02:24:31.741 --> 02:24:34.162]  We're about to lose America if we haven't lost it yet.
[02:24:34.202 --> 02:24:41.205]  We're so close to the edge of this country being changing from the most wonderful country in the world, the greatest government in the world.
[02:24:41.445 --> 02:24:42.526]  And isn't it poignant?
[02:24:42.586 --> 02:24:44.307]  I mean, really spiritual.
[02:24:44.967 --> 02:24:55.351]  It's, you know, like the two opposing forces that at this critical time that the movement was big enough and the internet had gotten large enough and that Ron Paul was ready and he said he didn't think it would be this big.
[02:24:55.611 --> 02:25:01.034]  He thought he would just be able to inject some debate into things that now he really does have a chance.
[02:25:01.694 --> 02:25:09.977]  Yes, he does have a chance, because we know that the Republican Party... It's the strategy you and I talked about a while back, actually, when you and I talked on the phone.
[02:25:10.017 --> 02:25:11.417]  I said to you... Four months ago.
[02:25:11.437 --> 02:25:16.499]  Yeah, some of these guys are going to the Republican Party, and when the Republicans win, they have nobody.
[02:25:16.519 --> 02:25:20.320]  Nobody cares about McCain, nobody really cares about Giuliani.
[02:25:20.540 --> 02:25:22.741]  They're all manufactured by the press.
[02:25:23.439 --> 02:25:23.799]  Okay?
[02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:26.642]  And so, now Ron Paul's gone and hasn't done it.
[02:25:27.002 --> 02:25:38.111]  And by the way, the globalist strategy was to have a bunch of weak candidates, real Republicans, and by, I don't mean good guy Republicans, but I mean real first-tier, that could've won, didn't run, they're gonna sit out and wait for the next round.
[02:25:38.511 --> 02:25:47.138]  It's been decided to pass the baton to Hillary, to the Democrat seat, so basically you had a weak field, perfect for us, the Constitutionalists, to exploit that.
[02:25:47.748 --> 02:25:48.269]  Exactly.
[02:25:48.889 --> 02:25:51.891]  And again, the point is, send the money now.
[02:25:52.031 --> 02:25:57.896]  All you guys listening out there, when the Alex Jones Show is over, don't just go back and say, boy, that was a great show.
[02:25:58.416 --> 02:25:59.157]  Get active.
[02:25:59.337 --> 02:26:00.118]  Do something.
[02:26:00.278 --> 02:26:01.139]  Call your friends.
[02:26:01.399 --> 02:26:03.000]  Send the money now.
[02:26:03.060 --> 02:26:08.524]  And if you don't have money, get a hold of their campaign and say, send me some yard signs, send me some bumper stickers, or go make them yourselves.
[02:26:08.744 --> 02:26:09.185]  And you know what?
[02:26:09.205 --> 02:26:10.206]  Go out and get some money.
[02:26:10.266 --> 02:26:11.346]  Go get a job for a week.
[02:26:11.707 --> 02:26:12.347]  Go get a job.
[02:26:12.387 --> 02:26:12.928]  Get some money.
[02:26:13.208 --> 02:26:14.829]  You can get money together for Ron Paul.
[02:26:14.849 --> 02:26:15.550]  It's that important.
[02:26:16.110 --> 02:26:18.352]  Look what our forefathers did to give us this country.
[02:26:18.552 --> 02:26:31.164]  And by the way, by the way, going and taking a third job or a second job for a month, you'll feel better sending that money to Ron Paul than you would going out and buying some Chinese made slave junk which will mean nothing to you.
[02:26:31.465 --> 02:26:37.030]  Let me tell you, it's giving money to causes like this and making sacrifices is a blessing to the people that give it.
[02:26:37.791 --> 02:26:38.351]  Absolutely.
[02:26:38.772 --> 02:26:39.612]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:26:39.632 --> 02:26:41.274]  I mean, that's why I made the movie I made.
[02:26:41.693 --> 02:26:44.414]  It was never about making money, it was about getting the word out there.
[02:26:44.734 --> 02:26:47.435]  And thank God, look, Ron Paul is the whole second half of my movie.
[02:26:47.815 --> 02:26:48.875]  Look how that worked out.
[02:26:49.736 --> 02:26:50.496]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:26:50.696 --> 02:26:54.157]  I mean, somehow things work in our favor.
[02:26:54.697 --> 02:26:57.098]  We have to be in spirit, you know?
[02:26:57.118 --> 02:27:05.961]  Too many people, I find, you know, talk about stuff, they want to say they want to be free, but people really, for the most part, aren't willing to do what's necessary.
[02:27:06.681 --> 02:27:09.922]  And I find it within my own organization, you know?
[02:27:10.438 --> 02:27:17.800]  Everybody talks a great game, but to get out there and actually do the labor and do the work, you know, people aren't willing to do it for the most part.
[02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:19.800]  And so we're going to end up getting what we deserve.
[02:27:20.220 --> 02:27:21.480]  But they're willing to on this.
[02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:27.582]  We're seeing a lot of movement, a lot of buzz, a lot of excitement like I have never seen before.
[02:27:27.602 --> 02:27:29.662]  Now is the time to move.
[02:27:30.382 --> 02:27:31.242]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:31.262 --> 02:27:31.782]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.863 --> 02:27:37.084]  We're on the march.

[02:28:55.600 --> 02:28:59.544]  Our own ambassador to the United Nations in 1982 admitted such.

[02:31:03.433 --> 02:31:21.824]  We're going to have some shows this week where it's open funds.
[02:31:22.004 --> 02:31:26.407]  We've got Jim Tucker popping in Friday to give us a report on Bilderberg with some new developments.
[02:31:26.867 --> 02:31:30.349]  He's going to be traveling over to the capital of Turkey
[02:31:31.721 --> 02:31:32.701]  Talk about dangerous.
[02:31:33.301 --> 02:31:38.483]  To cover it the next week, Bilderberg is already swinging back around, orbiting back through.
[02:31:39.443 --> 02:31:42.004]  This time to be in Turkey, in Istanbul.
[02:31:43.324 --> 02:31:47.005]  So we're going to have him on, and def student Daniel Estolano, on that next Friday.
[02:31:47.045 --> 02:31:48.125]  Not this Friday, but the next Friday.
[02:31:48.145 --> 02:31:48.965]  He'll be on this Friday, too.
[02:31:49.765 --> 02:31:55.907]  From the Bilderberg Group, giving us reports, I guess, at like 9, 10 o'clock at night, our time, or their time.
[02:31:56.903 --> 02:31:59.184]  So that's coming up, but we will have some open phones this week.
[02:31:59.224 --> 02:32:07.526]  Professor Stephen Jones is on with us tomorrow with his new paper, even more proof of thermite, thermate in the buildings and the samples they were able to get.
[02:32:08.507 --> 02:32:19.410]  Aaron Russo, the director, the producer of America, Freedom to Fascism is with us, along with Bob Dacey, writer of Shotgun, local Austinite, writer for the New American Magazine, local TV host.
[02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:21.731]  I want to put a plug in for Aaron Russo's video.
[02:32:22.458 --> 02:32:37.726]  Aaron has told me on-air and off-air that he's more proud of that film than making movies with Eddie Mercy and Bette Midler, some of them blockbusters, and bringing in huge rock bands like Led Zeppelin to America, and just all the famous things he's done.
[02:32:38.566 --> 02:32:38.786]  U.S.
[02:32:38.806 --> 02:32:39.927]  champion arm wrestler.
[02:32:40.387 --> 02:32:45.410]  He invented the more modern ladies' underwear, quite devilish of him.
[02:32:45.910 --> 02:32:49.031]  I mean, Aaron has done quite a bit.
[02:32:49.492 --> 02:32:50.452]  No, I'm serious, that's not a joke.
[02:32:52.806 --> 02:32:54.387]  With me snorting there, attempting not to laugh.
[02:32:54.447 --> 02:32:54.927]  No, I'm serious.
[02:32:55.007 --> 02:32:57.628]  Aaron is definitely a trailblazer.
[02:32:57.648 --> 02:33:00.789]  A lot of people don't know all the things he has done, but he's more proud of that.
[02:33:01.729 --> 02:33:04.070]  And I know why, because I've experienced the things I'm proud of.
[02:33:04.130 --> 02:33:08.211]  Doing a good job, standing up against evil, telling the truth, fighting these people.
[02:33:08.231 --> 02:33:12.593]  I'm either going to be wearing the white hat or the black hat, folks, and I'm glad I'm a good guy.
[02:33:13.373 --> 02:33:21.456]  I mean, you know, growing up as a, you know, 10 years old or something, I'd watch cartoons and stuff and kind of like the bad guy because they were cool, but by the time I was about 15, I didn't even like the bad guys on television.
[02:33:22.210 --> 02:33:35.080]  Folks, you need to be part of the good guys out there, and a great way to do that is to get America freedom to fascism, and we offer it at Infowars.com.
[02:33:35.100 --> 02:33:38.462]  When you get it for $19.95, you can get Terror Storm for half price for $9.95.
[02:33:38.662 --> 02:33:41.905]  My new film, A History of Government-Sponsored Terror.
[02:33:42.305 --> 02:33:43.526]  Go to Infowars.com.
[02:33:44.748 --> 02:33:46.129]  Support the filmmaker Aaron Russo.
[02:33:46.170 --> 02:33:48.111]  It also supports us when you do that.
[02:33:48.512 --> 02:33:50.474]  He put it out for free on Google Video and it's there.
[02:33:50.494 --> 02:33:54.237]  It's just not in super high quality but it's a great way.
[02:33:54.297 --> 02:33:55.198]  Pass that link around.
[02:33:56.119 --> 02:34:00.443]  My film, Order of Death, was number one on Google Video yesterday.
[02:34:00.883 --> 02:34:01.424]  Over 300,000 views in one day.
[02:34:03.291 --> 02:34:04.372]  I mean, that's exciting.
[02:34:04.412 --> 02:34:04.933]  Promote that.
[02:34:04.973 --> 02:34:05.754]  Help get the film out.
[02:34:05.774 --> 02:34:12.261]  But also support the filmmaker himself and have this amazing film in your library.
[02:34:12.601 --> 02:34:13.522]  Have the original.
[02:34:13.562 --> 02:34:19.088]  Have the high quality digital original instead of some download off the internet.
[02:34:19.108 --> 02:34:20.750]  America, Freedom to Fascism available.
[02:34:21.150 --> 02:34:23.632]  I know over at your bookstore slash hardware store slash gun shop
[02:34:42.503 --> 02:34:49.265]  Well, I actually attended that showing of it here in Austin at, where is that on South, what's the name of that place?
[02:34:49.285 --> 02:34:50.085]  Alamo Draft House.
[02:34:50.105 --> 02:34:50.825]  Alamo Draft House downtown.
[02:34:50.845 --> 02:34:52.406]  I attended that thing and I sat right there in the front row.
[02:35:07.501 --> 02:35:08.302]  Oh, Aaron was at that.
[02:35:08.382 --> 02:35:09.343]  And Aaron was at that.
[02:35:09.724 --> 02:35:15.731]  And, uh, I, you know, the thing that was fascinating to me about it is this, everything was true.
[02:35:15.891 --> 02:35:17.973]  You know, it's a documentary.
[02:35:18.093 --> 02:35:19.475]  It's a provable documentary.
[02:35:19.495 --> 02:35:23.600]  And I just, I love the interview with the former IRS commissioner.
[02:35:23.660 --> 02:35:24.381]  I just loved it.
[02:35:24.881 --> 02:35:27.743]  That was one of my favorite things I did.
[02:35:27.783 --> 02:35:28.984]  That was awesome.
[02:35:29.024 --> 02:35:30.865]  You asked the guy, well, you know, where's the law?
[02:35:30.885 --> 02:35:32.366]  And he says, hey, this is over, buddy.
[02:35:32.446 --> 02:35:32.866]  Shut up.
[02:35:33.446 --> 02:35:35.988]  Well, he said in Yiddish that there's no hope for you.
[02:35:36.008 --> 02:35:37.529]  Basically, you're doomed.
[02:35:37.649 --> 02:35:37.989]  Oh, man.
[02:35:38.029 --> 02:35:38.689]  What's that word?
[02:35:39.550 --> 02:35:40.551]  Gunnars von Helfen.
[02:35:41.671 --> 02:35:47.215]  Gunnars von Helfen means basically that there's nothing you can do about it.
[02:35:47.315 --> 02:35:49.336]  You can't escape it, you know.
[02:35:49.636 --> 02:35:51.017]  You know, it's over.
[02:35:52.017 --> 02:35:54.439]  You know, because he had nothing left to say.
[02:35:55.137 --> 02:35:57.759]  You know, so you had to give yourself a threat, you know?
[02:35:58.139 --> 02:36:00.220]  But getting that on film is great.
[02:36:00.561 --> 02:36:05.884]  My other favorite part of that documentary was the enthusiasm of that juror.
[02:36:06.124 --> 02:36:06.905]  That was awesome.
[02:36:06.925 --> 02:36:07.845]  Yeah, it was fantastic.
[02:36:07.865 --> 02:36:09.286]  Marcy Brooks, yes, she's brilliant.
[02:36:10.247 --> 02:36:10.807]  Great lady.
[02:36:10.867 --> 02:36:11.568]  I love that woman.
[02:36:11.588 --> 02:36:13.909]  She's such a wonderful person, you know?
[02:36:14.170 --> 02:36:18.612]  But the point is, my movie aside, you know, I made my movie to educate people.
[02:36:19.053 --> 02:36:21.634]  If you don't have a copy, I wish you'd go out and get one, folks.
[02:36:21.714 --> 02:36:23.816]  Call Allison, buy a copy, and get it done.
[02:36:24.457 --> 02:36:27.218]  You know, spread them around to everybody you can spread them to.
[02:36:27.738 --> 02:36:30.259]  But, you know, we got to get Ron Paul elected.
[02:36:30.299 --> 02:36:32.160]  That's what this is really about now, I mean.
[02:36:32.380 --> 02:36:35.341]  But I tell you, the film is a great campaign ad for Ron Paul.
[02:36:35.721 --> 02:36:39.362]  It's a fabulous campaign ad for Ron Paul, and that's why I want to get them spread everywhere.
[02:36:39.382 --> 02:36:42.463]  You know, I just want them passed out everywhere.
[02:36:42.503 --> 02:36:44.064]  Everybody knows who Ron Paul is.
[02:36:45.184 --> 02:36:47.525]  He's on the movie for quite a long time.
[02:36:48.386 --> 02:36:55.171]  I mean, how great is it though, in this key juncture in time, that everywhere our message is number one.
[02:36:55.251 --> 02:37:05.338]  I mean, every other day the number one video on YouTube or Google or all of them is a Patriot film, my film, Aaron's film, Loose Change, 9-11 Mysteries, some of the other films.
[02:37:05.919 --> 02:37:10.242]  I mean, to see that happening, I mean, it lets us know we're number one now!
[02:37:10.902 --> 02:37:13.864]  Well, it lets you know that they realize what's going on.
[02:37:13.944 --> 02:37:14.765]  They know there's a
[02:37:15.425 --> 02:37:19.628]  A spirit embracing the country and a movement happening that they want to squash.
[02:37:20.349 --> 02:37:21.790]  And they have to move very quickly.
[02:37:21.810 --> 02:37:26.394]  You've got to remember, there's a worldwide globalist movement happening now.
[02:37:26.414 --> 02:37:31.538]  In their minds, they're in the beginning of the third act, okay?
[02:37:31.958 --> 02:37:33.299]  This is the beginning of the end.
[02:37:33.459 --> 02:37:33.959]  Lay it out!
[02:37:34.580 --> 02:37:35.681]  Hold on, Eric.
[02:37:35.701 --> 02:37:38.263]  Give us the first and second act so people understand.
[02:37:38.343 --> 02:37:39.924]  Some people may not know what a play is.
[02:37:39.944 --> 02:37:42.286]  I mean, they know what a play is, but they don't know what acts are.
[02:37:42.853 --> 02:37:55.924]  Well, when you set up a movie or a show or something, and you have the first act, you introduce all the characters, the plot of the movie, you know, the middle is where everything sort of unfolds, and then the last act is where everything comes to its conclusion.
[02:37:56.785 --> 02:37:58.586]  And, uh, the finale.
[02:37:58.686 --> 02:38:00.728]  And right now, we're at the beginning of the last act.
[02:38:00.828 --> 02:38:11.097]  Everything they've put into place, putting the Federal Reserve into place, you know, putting all these government agencies there, passing all these horrific laws, everything's in place.
[02:38:11.704 --> 02:38:13.125]  First and second acts are done.
[02:38:14.046 --> 02:38:18.408]  Now the third act is the act of executing everything and bringing it all together.
[02:38:18.889 --> 02:38:29.536]  And what people don't realize is that this is a worldwide event going on, and that it's all these industrialized nations working together through the banking systems that are bringing this about.
[02:38:29.576 --> 02:38:37.661]  You know, what's real interesting is, I don't know if you people know about this, but China just bought into the Blackstone Group.
[02:38:38.647 --> 02:38:49.754]  Okay, they just spent three billion dollars buying into the Blackstone Group, which is an American company that's a private equity firm that's going to go public very shortly.
[02:38:50.715 --> 02:38:53.716]  And by buying into it, they spent three billion dollars.
[02:38:54.757 --> 02:39:02.542]  But Blackstone Group is also the group, and I started doing the research on this last night, and I'm pretty sure what I'm saying is accurate.
[02:39:03.582 --> 02:39:05.304]  The Blackstone Group is
[02:39:07.273 --> 02:39:13.217]  Uh, is the group that owned World Trade Building Number 7 that Larry Silverstein worked for.
[02:39:14.558 --> 02:39:24.484]  And isn't it interesting that this Building 7, uh, all the steel was shipped to China after the building came down.
[02:39:24.504 --> 02:39:26.366]  It was not treated as a crime scene.
[02:39:27.386 --> 02:39:35.852]  And now all of a sudden they're taking all the, they sent all the steel over to China, and now the Blackstone Group comes in and the Chinese Bank
[02:39:36.661 --> 02:39:42.105]  He comes in and spends three billion dollars to buy a small percentage of the stock of the company.
[02:39:42.166 --> 02:39:45.348]  Well, we know Silverstein in many ways was just a front for a holding company.
[02:39:45.368 --> 02:39:46.829]  He originally only owned seven.
[02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:48.631]  Blackstone is the holding company.
[02:39:49.171 --> 02:39:49.612]  Pardon me?
[02:39:49.872 --> 02:39:52.754]  I said Blackstone is the holding company for building seven.
[02:39:53.395 --> 02:39:54.155]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:39:54.435 --> 02:39:54.636]  Yeah.
[02:39:54.996 --> 02:40:02.522]  And so, now all of a sudden China comes in and buys a percentage, three billion dollars, of the Blackstone company.
[02:40:03.122 --> 02:40:05.965]  And that's the same, and that's where we sent the steel to.
[02:40:06.813 --> 02:40:10.099]  Uh, from the building that was never analyzed here for the thermite.
[02:40:18.092 --> 02:40:19.133]  This is the third act.
[02:40:19.173 --> 02:40:22.955]  I mean, all the dominoes are lined up, all the preparations, everything they've done.
[02:40:22.995 --> 02:40:23.875]  They're even saying this.
[02:40:23.895 --> 02:40:25.996]  They're even saying that they're four or five years behind.
[02:40:26.356 --> 02:40:27.497]  Their resistance is mounting.
[02:40:27.517 --> 02:40:30.378]  They're saying they're in danger of not getting it through.
[02:40:30.838 --> 02:40:34.940]  And I've always likened it to the Indy 500, the last lap.
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:38.622]  They're in the lead, but they didn't stop the last two pit stops.
[02:40:39.022 --> 02:40:45.045]  Their tires are bald, their engine's on fire, and I don't think they're going to make it.
[02:40:45.065 --> 02:40:46.186]  I think their engine's going to blow.
[02:40:46.646 --> 02:40:48.228]  Here's the problem, Alex.
[02:40:48.268 --> 02:40:49.549]  This is what's good about all this.
[02:40:49.929 --> 02:40:52.511]  You talk about this third act of this movie or this play.
[02:40:52.731 --> 02:40:56.914]  Well, this is one of these modern movies where there's an alternate ending, and it's the one we want.
[02:40:57.254 --> 02:40:59.516]  And we're going to push the button for the alternate ending.
[02:40:59.776 --> 02:41:00.517]  And I want to tell you something.
[02:41:00.557 --> 02:41:05.501]  I've been in this fight for a long time, and I felt like for all these years we're doing a delaying action.
[02:41:05.841 --> 02:41:07.702]  Slowly retreating, slowly retreating.
[02:41:08.103 --> 02:41:10.585]  A little sword fight where we're backing up, backing up, backing up.
[02:41:10.825 --> 02:41:12.406]  But now I don't feel like we're backing up.
[02:41:12.506 --> 02:41:14.307]  But that's what happened with the Alamo.
[02:41:14.327 --> 02:41:14.888]  That's what happened.
[02:41:15.728 --> 02:41:33.315]  If you study the Revolutionary War in 1776 to 1783 or 1784, they lost almost every battle except for Trenton and a couple others because it would be like 60,000 British troops to 7,000 American troops, Continental troops, but it was the fact that they were willing to keep fighting.
[02:41:33.815 --> 02:41:41.742]  I mean I've been in a few fights against somebody who's really mean back growing up, and as long as you kept fighting and hurting them, a lot of times they'd go ahead and end up walking off.
[02:41:41.802 --> 02:41:47.686]  Well what I'm saying is, for the first time in a long time, I'm actually feeling like we got them pushing back.
[02:41:48.087 --> 02:41:49.868]  They're the ones that are having a problem right now.
[02:41:49.948 --> 02:41:50.829]  We are advancing.
[02:41:51.089 --> 02:41:52.770]  It's a very positive thing.
[02:41:52.811 --> 02:41:57.414]  So this so-called third act of theirs, we're going to go for the alternate ending.
[02:41:57.534 --> 02:41:58.155]  That's what we're going to do.
[02:41:58.175 --> 02:41:58.595]  You know what?
[02:41:58.715 --> 02:41:59.516]  Bob just said it.
[02:42:00.396 --> 02:42:03.539]  And of course, I customarily interrupted the middle of it, but that's the signature here.
[02:42:04.620 --> 02:42:06.802]  And the self-deprecation is also my signature.
[02:42:06.842 --> 02:42:11.267]  But seriously, humor aside, Bob just said it all right there, Aaron.
[02:42:11.667 --> 02:42:18.173]  It is like we were always holding them like we did at the Alamo until the reserves got there, and now I wouldn't say we're pushing them back.
[02:42:18.514 --> 02:42:22.317]  I would say it's like fluctuating back and forth, like two sumo wrestlers.
[02:42:22.578 --> 02:42:24.059]  We don't know which way it's going to go.
[02:42:24.119 --> 02:42:24.860]  We've got to gut up.
[02:42:25.240 --> 02:42:28.162]  Well, I agree to a point with both of you, but I see it as, for the first time, as seeing resistance.
[02:42:28.182 --> 02:42:31.024]  I don't think they've really seen resistance before.
[02:42:31.044 --> 02:42:32.305]  We were like a mosquito before.
[02:42:32.365 --> 02:42:33.325]  Now we're like a horsefly.
[02:42:54.026 --> 02:42:56.907]  You know, a horse fly on a horse's ass, right?
[02:42:57.087 --> 02:43:00.649]  Yeah, well, the point is, you know, people are waking up.
[02:43:00.769 --> 02:43:01.809]  Bob, you're out of control today.
[02:43:01.829 --> 02:43:02.490]  Sorry about that.
[02:43:02.550 --> 02:43:02.990]  I'm sorry.
[02:43:03.030 --> 02:43:04.671]  Go ahead, Aaron.
[02:43:04.691 --> 02:43:11.474]  They know people are waking up, and they know that as people wake up more and more, the resistance is just going to build.
[02:43:12.154 --> 02:43:16.697]  And so they've got to get, you know, like this thing with the Immigration Act they're trying to pass, you know?
[02:43:17.157 --> 02:43:21.259]  It's really about the ID card and everybody carrying an ID card.
[02:43:22.783 --> 02:43:23.363]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:43:23.403 --> 02:43:44.709]  In fact, I mean, they can see the exponential growth curve of the movement, and you try to explain to the public, hey, this isn't just an amnesty, this means, yeah, they're going to federalize every worker in America, what Ridge called for three years ago on C-SPAN, and check your biometric Real ID Act card, and then enforce it on the American people, while selectively enforcing and leaving the illegal aliens alone!
[02:43:45.270 --> 02:43:46.190]  That's it in a nutshell!
[02:43:46.750 --> 02:43:49.951]  I think I once told you, I think I said this to you, I'm not sure,
[02:43:50.683 --> 02:43:53.424]  But when I was hanging out with Ms.
[02:43:53.464 --> 02:44:02.706]  Rockefeller, one of them said to me, when you give out the ID card, you get stopped by a cop, you show them your ID card, and your card will say KMA on it.
[02:44:03.726 --> 02:44:05.286]  Which means kiss my behind, yeah.
[02:44:05.546 --> 02:44:06.167]  Exactly.
[02:44:06.187 --> 02:44:06.947]  My platoon, yeah.
[02:44:07.327 --> 02:44:09.928]  Yeah, and so that's the point.
[02:44:09.968 --> 02:44:11.048]  They know what they're doing.
[02:44:12.267 --> 02:44:15.731]  The fact is, this immigration thing is all about us getting ID cards.
[02:44:15.791 --> 02:44:18.814]  They're going to find someone, you can't get a job without it.
[02:44:19.335 --> 02:44:23.359]  You know, uh, this thing that... Well, that's what they're saying under Real ID Act by itself.
[02:44:23.379 --> 02:44:26.482]  They're just integrating it into the Guest Worker Program for citizens anyways.
[02:44:26.502 --> 02:44:30.627]  They're saying, we're going to have to have federal ID checks just to have jobs.
[02:44:30.987 --> 02:44:34.191]  Exactly, and now they're passing a law spec.
[02:44:34.771 --> 02:44:57.757]  Well, did you see the other, I mean during the debate, every other candidate, it was like they were not talking to the American people, they were showing off in a beauty contest for David Rockefeller and Kissinger and the Rothschilds, they were all up there going, we need a national ID card, we need this to stop the illegals.
[02:44:57.917 --> 02:44:59.138]  That was mostly Giuliani doing that.
[02:45:00.979 --> 02:45:09.284]  Yeah, if you look at building a North American community and Mr. Dr. Professor Trader Robert Pastor and the CFR, I mean, look what they want.
[02:45:09.364 --> 02:45:12.806]  They want total labor mobility between the three countries.
[02:45:13.146 --> 02:45:17.089]  That will, in effect, make all this immigration stuff go away anyway.
[02:45:17.169 --> 02:45:18.950]  So, obviously, what's the real reason for that?
[02:45:18.970 --> 02:45:22.832]  Yeah, they're saying, we're going to end murder because we're going to stop calling it murder and legalize it.
[02:45:24.253 --> 02:45:27.456]  Exactly.
[02:45:27.936 --> 02:45:29.177]  We could sit and talk about it.
[02:45:29.417 --> 02:45:37.624]  The truth of the matter is, I don't know how to make the American public, I try so hard to make them understand how serious this is.
[02:45:38.144 --> 02:45:41.146]  You know, when I talked about revolution the other day, you know, I mean it.
[02:45:41.206 --> 02:45:42.888]  I mean, what's happening here?
[02:45:43.759 --> 02:45:44.720]  It's beyond the pale!
[02:46:14.259 --> 02:46:16.581]  Well, it's globalization.
[02:46:16.621 --> 02:46:26.866]  What's happened is they've destroyed the American worker to create a global environment for all these big corporations to exist in and screw the American worker.
[02:46:26.886 --> 02:46:27.806]  They don't mean anything.
[02:46:28.527 --> 02:46:29.907]  They don't care about America.
[02:46:29.947 --> 02:46:33.209]  America's being sold out for China, for other countries.
[02:46:33.809 --> 02:46:34.690]  That's all it's about.
[02:46:34.710 --> 02:46:36.771]  It's about where the money's going to flow from.
[02:46:36.891 --> 02:46:40.253]  Capital, where's the capital going to flow from?
[02:46:40.273 --> 02:46:40.713]  Who to who?
[02:46:41.328 --> 02:46:43.188]  They don't care about the people of America.
[02:46:43.208 --> 02:46:44.609]  There's no loyalty to America.
[02:46:44.649 --> 02:46:46.189]  And they're listening to nothing we say.
[02:46:46.369 --> 02:46:56.371]  Even the legislatures of Indiana, Texas, and others say, may we please see the agreement between the Departments of Transportation, local, and the foreigners, and they say no.
[02:46:56.491 --> 02:46:56.771]  No.
[02:46:57.051 --> 02:46:57.711]  Exactly.
[02:46:58.971 --> 02:47:00.572]  And how are we putting up with this?
[02:47:01.112 --> 02:47:02.452]  I mean, it's just on its face.
[02:47:02.492 --> 02:47:04.973]  Somehow, Alex, we've got to get together.
[02:47:05.133 --> 02:47:07.053]  I'm not sure I know how to do this exactly.
[02:47:07.711 --> 02:47:13.874]  We've all got to get together and have a meeting or something to find a way to balance things back.
[02:47:13.954 --> 02:47:16.556]  I mean, you can sit on the radio all day long and I can make movies.
[02:47:16.576 --> 02:47:18.597]  There's all kinds of things we can do.
[02:47:18.617 --> 02:47:25.321]  Now, when we met about four months ago, you talked about you and I and Ron Paul and a few other people meeting and trying to come up with a strategy.
[02:47:25.741 --> 02:47:30.003]  And I just think what we're seeing is, it was funny, everything you strategize is exactly what Ron Paul is doing.
[02:47:30.363 --> 02:47:32.985]  I think our type of minds do think alike.
[02:47:34.205 --> 02:47:35.606]  There's no question about it.
[02:47:36.026 --> 02:47:39.967]  But somehow we've got to reach into them, into their spirit, to understand how serious this is.
[02:47:56.775 --> 02:48:04.520]  Sometimes when you talk about something, it ceases to carry the same gravity, the same weight that you want it to carry, because you talk about it so much.
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:05.420]  I'll tell you something, Alex.
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:06.861]  I'll tell you what's going to happen in Texas.
[02:48:07.141 --> 02:48:19.628]  Once all this trans-Texas corridor moratorium stuff settles out, we're going to find out who tried to stop the moratorium, who got in the way, and we're going to make sure they can't elect a dog catcher for the next election.
[02:48:20.849 --> 02:48:22.730]  Well, I don't know if that's enough either.
[02:48:22.970 --> 02:48:24.251]  It's not enough, but it's something.
[02:48:25.564 --> 02:48:27.346]  Alex, you and I never discussed.
[02:48:27.366 --> 02:48:28.708]  I have an idea for Louie.
[02:48:29.289 --> 02:48:29.930]  Well, stay there.
[02:48:30.010 --> 02:48:30.530]  Stay there.
[02:48:30.590 --> 02:48:32.633]  Final segment with Aaron Russo and Bob Dacey.
[02:48:34.115 --> 02:48:34.996]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:48:35.136 --> 02:48:38.761]  InfoWars.com JonesReport.com InfoWars.net
[02:48:48.377 --> 02:48:51.583]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:51.903 --> 02:48:53.867]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.227 --> 02:49:01.800]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.566 --> 02:49:09.610]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.010 --> 02:49:21.456]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.736 --> 02:49:25.679]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.699 --> 02:49:27.620]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:31.822]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:46.812 --> 02:49:50.975]  The war on terrorism, will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:51.236 --> 02:49:55.418]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:55.819 --> 02:49:56.659]  So what do you do?
[02:49:56.980 --> 02:50:01.543]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:50:02.023 --> 02:50:04.145]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:50:04.626 --> 02:50:05.527]  Sheltering in Place!
[02:50:05.927 --> 02:50:19.340]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:50:45.086 --> 02:50:46.807]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:47.027 --> 02:50:50.728]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:50:51.048 --> 02:50:53.249]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[02:50:53.769 --> 02:50:59.992]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:51:00.132 --> 02:51:05.053]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:05.254 --> 02:51:14.197]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[02:51:49.875 --> 02:51:52.236]  Giuliani has opened the door for Ron Paul.
[02:51:53.056 --> 02:51:54.577]  He is the Goliath.
[02:51:55.637 --> 02:51:56.758]  Ron Paul is David.
[02:51:57.718 --> 02:52:04.481]  And if Ron Paul savages him and goes at the jugular, you're talking about real contender status.
[02:52:04.521 --> 02:52:05.901]  He's already rising exponentially.
[02:52:05.921 --> 02:52:07.242]  They're trying to claim he's a fad.
[02:52:07.582 --> 02:52:09.182]  They're already announcing, oh, he'll blow over.
[02:52:09.222 --> 02:52:10.143]  He's already blowing over.
[02:52:10.703 --> 02:52:11.864]  They're trying to set the agenda.
[02:52:11.884 --> 02:52:12.484]  It's not going to work.
[02:52:12.504 --> 02:52:14.044]  We're going to write articles about all of this.
[02:52:14.525 --> 02:52:15.545]  Get this out to the people.
[02:52:16.631 --> 02:52:19.713]  And make sure that all of you take action on this.
[02:52:19.733 --> 02:52:21.114]  Just keep pushing on Ron Paul.
[02:52:21.174 --> 02:52:21.754]  Don't stop.
[02:52:22.674 --> 02:52:25.096]  In closing, I want to thank both of you gentlemen for being on today.
[02:52:25.136 --> 02:52:27.817]  And Aaron, thank your wife for coming on.
[02:52:27.837 --> 02:52:30.519]  I know that she's there trying to take care of you.
[02:52:30.559 --> 02:52:32.140]  Make sure you make it through this fight.
[02:52:32.460 --> 02:52:33.400]  We will be praying for you.
[02:52:33.420 --> 02:52:35.802]  I know you say you don't care about yourself, but we do need to pray for you.
[02:52:36.162 --> 02:52:38.483]  We need you there as a great asset in liberty and freedom.
[02:52:39.344 --> 02:52:41.765]  Any closing comments just about everything we face?
[02:52:42.926 --> 02:52:46.248]  I mean, look at the Democrats, totally pro-war, with that smoke and mirrors.
[02:52:46.928 --> 02:52:49.550]  You know, the war just goes on and on.
[02:52:49.930 --> 02:52:54.352]  Where do you see all this going if Ron Paul doesn't win, or if Ron Paul doesn't get the nomination?
[02:52:54.852 --> 02:53:02.716]  If Ron Paul doesn't get the nomination, what's happening is we're heading into everything George Orwell was afraid of.
[02:53:02.736 --> 02:53:06.778]  You know, it's all coming to pass, unless there's a revolution in this country.
[02:53:07.419 --> 02:53:11.401]  Unless there actually becomes a violent revolution of some sort, then nothing's going to change it.
[02:53:12.473 --> 02:53:14.695]  Other than that, at this point in the game, in my opinion.
[02:53:14.715 --> 02:53:18.078]  You know, I just... It is like a Twilight Zone episode, dude.
[02:53:18.118 --> 02:53:20.800]  Have the AP saying they're gonna have Mexican police on our streets.
[02:53:20.980 --> 02:53:22.321]  Oh, man, think about it.
[02:53:22.781 --> 02:53:23.682]  Mexican police...
[02:53:24.435 --> 02:53:25.796]  I mean, foreign armies here.
[02:53:25.856 --> 02:53:26.616]  I mean, what are we doing?
[02:53:26.636 --> 02:53:27.737]  We don't have America anymore.
[02:53:27.797 --> 02:53:30.538]  And it doesn't have anything to do with the American people.
[02:53:30.558 --> 02:53:31.899]  It has a lot to do with the bankers.
[02:53:32.139 --> 02:53:33.699]  Well, you know, what comes around goes around.
[02:53:33.740 --> 02:53:36.541]  We've been over there for, actually, 16 years in Iraq.
[02:53:36.621 --> 02:53:37.701]  Over 3 million dead.
[02:53:37.721 --> 02:53:40.903]  Uh, 650,000 the first three years of occupation.
[02:53:40.923 --> 02:53:42.444]  Now over a million conservative numbers.
[02:53:43.304 --> 02:53:44.825]  And they're occupied and they don't like it.
[02:53:44.865 --> 02:53:46.926]  Well, you're going to get to be occupied, America.
[02:53:46.946 --> 02:53:48.266]  Exactly.
[02:53:48.767 --> 02:53:50.407]  And they don't care.
[02:53:50.548 --> 02:53:51.948]  Here's the thing.
[02:53:52.008 --> 02:53:53.429]  For some reason, people can't
[02:53:53.891 --> 02:53:57.633]  Get past the fact that it's not the government running things.
[02:53:58.313 --> 02:54:00.474]  It's the elite bankers that are running things.
[02:54:00.694 --> 02:54:04.616]  And they can't get past the fact that the government doesn't care about us.
[02:54:05.536 --> 02:54:07.597]  They don't care about us.
[02:54:07.637 --> 02:54:09.278]  They don't even think about us.
[02:54:09.338 --> 02:54:10.498]  It's a complete joke.
[02:54:10.538 --> 02:54:13.960]  I mean, there's not even a discussion of what you want or what you say.
[02:54:14.280 --> 02:54:16.501]  It's all about how to lie and scam you, Bob Dasing.
[02:54:18.374 --> 02:54:24.697]  That is exactly why Ron Paul is resonating all across the political spectrum in America right now.
[02:54:24.897 --> 02:54:28.299]  They see the man and they see all these shills and put up
[02:54:28.866 --> 02:54:29.767]  That's a good question.
[02:54:29.787 --> 02:54:30.768]  That really is a good question.
[02:54:30.788 --> 02:54:31.368]  I think it's because
[02:54:55.247 --> 02:54:57.689]  They didn't have anything to come out of Ron Paul.
[02:54:57.949 --> 02:54:59.830]  They had to have ten people in a debate.
[02:55:00.391 --> 02:55:06.214]  If it was Romney, Giuliani, and McCain, and just Ron Paul, they would never have allowed that.
[02:55:06.395 --> 02:55:09.016]  Again, it's designed to make Hillary look good, yeah.
[02:55:09.036 --> 02:55:11.138]  Yeah, but there's ten people up there, you know what I'm saying?
[02:55:11.158 --> 02:55:14.420]  They didn't think anybody was going to emerge in that standpoint.
[02:55:14.460 --> 02:55:16.641]  And they're controlling so much of the questions and stuff.
[02:55:17.062 --> 02:55:19.143]  And they thought it might be a good idea to bury Ron.
[02:55:19.639 --> 02:55:31.791]  But you know, I do have, I've said this a few times on this show, I've never discussed it with you, but I have an idea for a movie that I believe might change a lot of things in this country.
[02:55:32.312 --> 02:55:33.713]  And you and I gotta talk about it.
[02:55:33.733 --> 02:55:36.196]  You and I have to have a conversation about this movie.
[02:55:36.636 --> 02:55:38.138]  When do you want me to give you a call, Aaron?
[02:55:38.718 --> 02:55:39.579]  At your convenience.
[02:55:39.659 --> 02:55:41.541]  It's not a documentary.
[02:55:42.502 --> 02:55:43.563]  It's a movie, but it's...
[02:55:44.202 --> 02:55:46.403]  Everything we talk about is in this movie.
[02:55:47.364 --> 02:55:49.185]  Is it a good time for me to call you in like 30 minutes?
[02:55:50.045 --> 02:55:50.986]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:55:51.246 --> 02:55:53.387]  Aaron Russo, director of American Freedom from Fascism.
[02:55:53.727 --> 02:55:55.008]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:55.048 --> 02:55:56.128]  Thanks for being on with us, my friend.
[02:55:56.468 --> 02:55:57.549]  Thanks.
[02:55:57.629 --> 02:56:01.311]  Anything you have... I have such tremendous respect and admiration for you, Alex.
[02:56:01.811 --> 02:56:02.712]  You have no idea.
[02:56:02.732 --> 02:56:03.672]  You really don't know.
[02:56:03.712 --> 02:56:06.373]  I have nothing but love in my heart for you.
[02:56:06.533 --> 02:56:07.994]  Well, you know I love you too, Aaron.
[02:56:08.054 --> 02:56:10.015]  It's all right back at you, my friend.
[02:56:10.075 --> 02:56:10.475]  Take care.
[02:56:10.496 --> 02:56:11.236]  Thank you.
[02:56:11.972 --> 02:56:15.115]  Here goes Aaron Russo, and Bob Dacey, I want to thank you, my friend, for being here.
[02:56:15.355 --> 02:56:16.677]  Well, I want to appreciate it, Alex.
[02:56:16.737 --> 02:56:17.357]  Anytime.
[02:56:17.397 --> 02:56:18.658]  Anytime you want me here, I'm here.
[02:56:18.719 --> 02:56:19.039]  You bet.
[02:56:19.079 --> 02:56:22.842]  Great analysis of the North American Union that they deny exist, like they deny the sun exists.
[02:56:23.083 --> 02:56:23.783]  God bless you all.
