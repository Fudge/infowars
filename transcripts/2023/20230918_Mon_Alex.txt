[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:08.372]  After everything you've seen these criminals do, do you think you're going to be safer and healthier and wealthier and wiser if you roll over and go along with them?
[00:00:09.712 --> 00:00:13.813]  Or are you going to fully educate yourself on this and start educating others?
[00:00:14.774 --> 00:00:16.474]  Because sunlight is the disinfectant.
[00:00:17.314 --> 00:00:29.323]   We've got to spotlight these cockroaches, like Ted Nugent says, and we've got to reach out to God And pray to God to lead God and direct us.
[00:00:30.104 --> 00:00:30.864]  Because without God...
[00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:32.680]  We don't have a hope.
[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.322]  If we have God, no one can stand against us.
[00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:36.623]  But this is true evil.
[00:00:36.663 --> 00:00:38.184]  We have to admit true evil exists.
[00:00:38.744 --> 00:00:40.586]  We have to understand this is not the legitimate government.
[00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:48.632]  This is the military industrial complex controlled by a small technological corporate scientific elite that Eisenhower warned us about.
[00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:52.215]  Most people only talk about his military industrial complex comment.
[00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:56.178]  He said controlled by a technological elite.
[00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:58.220]  And that was in 1961.
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.761]  He was aware of what was going on.
[00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:01.603]  And he was warning people about it.
[00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.804]  So, these people think everybody else are animals, they think we're all stupid, and they think we deserve to die.
[00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:10.449]  They're eugenics-based.
[00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:11.850]  He goes back to Plato.
[00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:18.115]  They're, quote, aristocrats who are not trying to empower and hold up society and build libraries and educate children.
[00:01:18.816 --> 00:01:25.161]  They're going against all that and trying to dumb us down so that we're more easily processed and gotten rid of.
[00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:29.304]  What did the head of the Club of Rome famously say just a few years ago?
[00:01:29.324 --> 00:01:30.365]  We played the clip last week.
[00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:32.166]  In fact, Owen's coming up.
[00:01:32.206 --> 00:01:32.907]  We should play it again.
[00:01:32.927 --> 00:01:34.688]  In fact, we'll come out of break and play it.
[00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:40.380]   He said, I hope we can Depopulate the planet in a civil way.
[00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:42.863]  But he goes, but we're going to depopulate you.
[00:01:44.414 --> 00:01:46.975]  And again, the average white liberal goes, yo, there are too many people.
[00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:49.336]  Hey, dumbass, you're being fed the bugs.
[00:01:49.396 --> 00:01:50.616]  You're having your energy cut off.
[00:01:51.096 --> 00:01:52.597]  You're being sprayed with this stuff as well.
[00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:56.678]  It's the left that's targeted the most, that takes all the shots, that buys into it.
[00:01:57.598 --> 00:02:00.399]  So they believe they're promoting a utopia, they're promoting a dystopia.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.680]  This is a war against humanity.
[00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:06.301]  This is the end of the world as we know it.
[00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:08.482]  Everything previous to this has been a buildup.
[00:02:08.842 --> 00:02:10.563]  We're going into the permanent emergency.
[00:02:11.383 --> 00:02:14.325]  So I'm going to ask listeners again to realize the power you've got right now.
[00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:17.547]  Take the live link to the show, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:02:17.927 --> 00:02:19.328]  Take the links off Bandai Video.
[00:02:19.568 --> 00:02:23.791]  When this report's archived at Bandai Video, share it like your life depends on it, because it does.
[00:02:28.293 --> 00:02:33.276]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:02:33.316 --> 00:02:34.857]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:48.647]  If you think what's happening to Alex Jones is bad, or if you think what's happening to Owen Schreier is bad, or what's happening to Russell Brand is bad, just wait till you see what they do to your neighbor!
[00:02:49.428 --> 00:02:52.030]  Because they start with the influencers, to set an example.
[00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.475]  They get real frustrated when Alex says something more than when your neighbor says something, because Alex has millions upon millions of listeners, so they're gonna go after him first.
[00:02:58.695 --> 00:03:00.237]  But it's not gonna stop there, folks.
[00:03:00.877 --> 00:03:11.384]  When Trump said, it's not me they're after, it's you, I'm just in the way, that was perhaps the most true political statement, political slogan in the history of political slogans in the United States of America.
[00:03:11.884 --> 00:03:13.185]  And they are coming after you.
[00:03:13.766 --> 00:03:19.830]  And that's why it's more important than ever to fight back and to speak out because cowardice is exploited.
[00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.111]  So don't be a coward.
[00:03:22.131 --> 00:03:25.133]  The first step to non-compliance is speaking out.
[00:03:25.614 --> 00:03:30.014]  Visit InfoWars.com/show and share the link today.
[00:03:30.014 --> 00:03:40.414]  It's Monday.
[00:03:40.414 --> 00:03:50.414]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:41.548 --> 00:03:42.629]  September 18th, 2023.
[00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:55.118]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and what you just saw and heard Chase Geyser say last night on the Sunday broadcast is absolutely central to saving our country and the world right now.
[00:03:56.118 --> 00:04:01.402]  It's the fact that the globalists aren't coming after Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump and Russell Brand and Alex Jones.
[00:04:02.903 --> 00:04:04.544]  They're coming after you.
[00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:10.350]  They're coming after your rights, your freedoms, your wealth.
[00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:20.574]  They're closing the door on upper mobility in the first world because they can't have an example of an open, free society to the rest of the world that they've already enslaved.
[00:04:20.955 --> 00:04:24.376]  They can't have the communist Chinese aspire to get out of that system.
[00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:27.757]  They can't have poor Africans aspire to own a car of air conditioning.
[00:04:28.197 --> 00:04:29.738]  Obama told them that before he left office.
[00:04:30.058 --> 00:04:31.439]  You can't have cars of air conditioning.
[00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:33.120]  You can't have children.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.881]  The world will overeat.
[00:04:35.522 --> 00:04:36.043]  You're bad.
[00:04:36.683 --> 00:04:43.489]  But Obama can have his big oceanfront property and his mansions in Hawaii and Massachusetts and his private jets.
[00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.275]  So, it's central to understanding the situation we're into to admit we're in a war.
[00:04:51.195 --> 00:05:08.060]  And that war, that deindustrialization program, that rewilding program, that post-enlightenment system has gone from its testing phases to its operational phase, I've said many times.
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:20.671]   And that's why it's very important to understand that a lot of really smart analysts that I respect I concur with my own breakdown, and that's that they're bringing in a permanent emergency.
[00:05:21.493 --> 00:05:22.755]  The COVID emergency.
[00:05:22.795 --> 00:05:31.995]   the climate emergency, the violence, crime emergency, gun emergency, that the system
[00:05:31.995 --> 00:05:38.694]   exacerbates in every way they can every day with the Soros DAs here in the U.S., but also
[00:05:38.694 --> 00:05:44.994]   similarly in Europe that don't prosecute rapists and murderers, not to mention people looting
[00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:46.395]  stores.
[00:05:46.395 --> 00:05:52.834]   All this is designed to create a feeling of desperation and hopelessness and demoralization
[00:05:52.834 --> 00:05:57.675]   to make us lay down and roll over and accept the Great Reset and the Build Back Better
[00:05:57.675 --> 00:06:01.275]  program where they erase the old economy.
[00:06:01.275 --> 00:06:02.535]  (sniffles)
[00:06:02.551 --> 00:06:19.158]  In a giant cloud pivot exercise of demolition, and then they bring in the world social credit score, the central bank digital currencies, the programmable money, in their own words, that is here and being rolled out this year and next year around the world.
[00:06:19.678 --> 00:06:23.680]  And then if you behave yourself, you get a universal basic income.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.381]  But again, you can only buy with that what they want.
[00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:30.583]  Can't buy a car, but you can ride a bus for now.
[00:06:31.503 --> 00:06:36.950]  Can't get steak, can't get chicken, can't get fish, but you can get cricket protein.
[00:06:37.511 --> 00:06:44.780]  This is a totally managed technocracy economy in their own words where they control every aspect of your life.
[00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:51.548]   This is dystopia being sold as the solution To the hell they're creating.
[00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:59.214]  But the artificial dystopia they're making can be easily reversed and fixed as long as too much of the infrastructure isn't destroyed.
[00:06:59.894 --> 00:07:18.147]  But that's why, through devaluation of currencies, and through open borders, and human smuggling, and regulations to cut off the energy, and all the mysterious fires in the Western world, and explosions destroying infrastructure, destroying food processing plants, and all the arson where they catch leftist environmentalists setting it all over the Western world.
[00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.852]  All of that is bringing in the perfect storm of control.
[00:07:21.872 --> 00:07:24.393]  So when we come back, I'm going to break it all down.
[00:07:24.413 --> 00:07:25.554]  This is beyond critical.
[00:07:25.834 --> 00:07:26.655]  Please spread the word.
[00:07:26.855 --> 00:07:29.036]  Infowars.com is tomorrow.
[00:07:29.056 --> 00:07:31.278]  As soon as today, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:35.621]  It's Monday, September 18th, 2023.
[00:07:39.048 --> 00:07:46.875]  And Fox News is now reporting on a story that could bring down the entire New World Order globalist system.
[00:07:47.936 --> 00:07:54.242]  It's on national Fox News, but it first broke on local Fox News in Missouri.
[00:07:55.123 --> 00:08:00.748]  We're going to be playing these newscasts coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:04.711]  Now, the first thing I want to say about this is very important.
[00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:13.348]  We already reported on this in my earlier documentaries more than 20 years ago.
[00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:24.451]  But it's just now, 50 plus years later, that they are declassifying the full extent of what they've done.
[00:08:25.412 --> 00:08:31.754]  And now investigative reporters are digging into the National Archives in different cities around the country.
[00:08:33.246 --> 00:09:01.263]  And discovering that in every major city, in the predominantly black but also poor white neighborhoods, they would hit areas in the Appalachians as well, they didn't care as long as you were poor, with radioactive dust and other deadly chemicals sprayed by airplanes, sprayed by trucks, and sprayed out of exhausts.
[00:09:02.586 --> 00:09:20.056]  Systems set up on the roofs of buildings that look like it's just the exhaust from a furnace or something like that and instead it sprays deadly radioactive isotope on you that gives you lung and bone cancer within just a few years.
[00:09:20.917 --> 00:09:25.479]  Now this is only one project that's been declassified.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.762]  They released bio weapons in the New York subway.
[00:09:30.281 --> 00:09:34.441]  in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, that's been declassified.
[00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:36.281]  The CIA did.
[00:09:36.281 --> 00:09:43.880]   There are literally thousands of these programs that I personally know about from the National Archives
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.841]  that I've seen reported on over the years.
[00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:47.521]  And it's not just in the US.
[00:09:47.521 --> 00:09:52.561]   They did it in the UK, they did it in Israel, they did it in the continent of Europe.
[00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:59.761]   Anywhere that the Bilderberg Group, Anglo-American globalist power block is in control,
[00:10:00.561 --> 00:10:09.121]   they've tested everything from anthrax on the public, radioactive isotopes, syphilis, weaponized syphilis,
[00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:17.841]   of course, the souped up version of Lyme's disease developed at Plum Island off the coast of New York
[00:10:18.295 --> 00:10:18.816]  military.
[00:10:19.296 --> 00:10:20.737]  That was released against the public.
[00:10:21.357 --> 00:10:30.935]   But let's just drill into the one case Over a decade they're declassifying in the 1950s in St.
[00:10:33.876 --> 00:10:34.636]  Louis, Missouri.
[00:10:36.497 --> 00:10:41.258]  Because as Stalin said, one man dies is a tragedy, 10,000 dies is a statistic.
[00:10:41.978 --> 00:10:51.280]  But there is no doubt that every one of you listening today, whether you're black, white, Hispanic, old, young, you had family members, or perhaps even you, that were hit by this.
[00:10:52.681 --> 00:10:53.781]  Now why is this so important?
[00:10:55.239 --> 00:10:56.519]  Congress didn't know about this.
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.480]  The Senate didn't know about this.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.261]  This was all hidden under the National Security Act of 1947.
[00:11:02.501 --> 00:11:14.845]  This is a mad scientist eugenics cult that has been in control of our main universities and in control of the leadership of the intelligence agencies and shadow government at least since 1947.
[00:11:14.945 --> 00:11:20.927]  And they believe there's too many people and they want to be able to play God.
[00:11:22.162 --> 00:11:42.335]  And they want to be able to also do these tests everywhere, to have larger and larger teams of people that work for the system, who will then go out and carry out these lethal, murderous operations against the people, so they have a larger army in the future that's been compromised that they can trust.
[00:11:42.395 --> 00:11:46.518]  And that's what the poison prion COVID shot is about.
[00:11:47.558 --> 00:11:56.962]  It's about getting a wider group now of doctors and scientists and lawyers and nurses and people that went along with it, the rollout of the lies.
[00:11:57.042 --> 00:12:02.044]  Then they discover it's a fraud and still defend the fraud they believe to cover their butts.
[00:12:02.964 --> 00:12:07.246]  And now you've corrupted a larger concentric ring.
[00:12:08.697 --> 00:12:16.777]   around that and expanded the base of people that will carry out any operation you want at any time.
[00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:22.937]   And that's how this system operates. I've told you this many times, I'm explaining again.
[00:12:22.937 --> 00:12:28.375]   My father was top of his class when he was 14. He got recruited, he thought into NASA,
[00:12:28.375 --> 00:12:37.895]   and he was at UT at Plan 2. This is in the mid-1960s, and then discovered very quickly that
[00:12:38.456 --> 00:12:42.856]   They were basically training people to carry out mad scientist operations.
[00:12:43.003 --> 00:12:54.850]  He was 15 years old at the cancer research facility in Houston, MD Anderson, there when they were doing all sorts of secret experiments on people that had cancer that was lethal, okay?
[00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:56.391]  Now, that's when my dad's 15.
[00:12:57.651 --> 00:12:58.812]  He got out of it by the time he was 20.
[00:13:00.193 --> 00:13:03.655]  But just to understand, ladies and gentlemen, that's how big this is.
[00:13:04.295 --> 00:13:07.557]  They've recruited millions and millions and millions of people into it.
[00:13:08.278 --> 00:13:14.341]  Remember Fauci giving mainly little black kids deadly HIV drugs in the 80s and 90s?
[00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:15.302]  Used to be a big story.
[00:13:17.048 --> 00:13:20.489]  These people mean business, and they want to be able to play God.
[00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:27.051]  So right now, let's go to the local Fox newscast talking about this.
[00:13:27.111 --> 00:13:30.052]  The full story is on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:30.072 --> 00:13:36.574]  Then I'm going to come back and tie it into the globalist going from beta, because you think all this mass murder is bad.
[00:13:36.614 --> 00:13:38.975]  This is just a test, into operational.
[00:13:39.855 --> 00:13:45.344]  The geoengineering, the 5G, the poison shots, the GMO food, the nanotech, it's all here.
[00:13:45.725 --> 00:13:47.247]  Here's the local report from Local Fox.
[00:13:49.215 --> 00:13:53.617]  This next story is so unbelievable, we didn't think it could possibly be true.
[00:13:53.797 --> 00:14:06.063]  But after receiving thousands of records and declassified reports from the Army, it's confirmed that during the Cold War, the United States military conducted secret tests on unsuspecting people in the city of St.
[00:14:06.103 --> 00:14:06.403]  Louis.
[00:14:07.003 --> 00:14:12.966]  A local sociologist will make her findings public tomorrow, but she spoke first to the I-team's Lisa Zignan.
[00:14:14.933 --> 00:14:22.599]  Lisa Martino-Taylor's life work has been to uncover details of the Army's ultra-secret military experiments carried out in St.
[00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:25.822]  Louis and other cities during the 1950s and 60s.
[00:14:26.202 --> 00:14:28.184]  This study was secretive for a reason.
[00:14:28.204 --> 00:14:36.711]  They didn't have volunteers stepping up and saying, yeah, I'll breathe zinc cadmium sulfide with radioactive particles.
[00:14:37.091 --> 00:14:42.874]  These Army archive pictures show how the tests were done in Corpus Christi, Texas in the 1960s.
[00:14:43.454 --> 00:14:45.535]  In Texas, planes were used to drop the chemical.
[00:14:45.835 --> 00:14:46.315]  But in St.
[00:14:46.355 --> 00:14:50.337]  Louis, the Army placed chemical sprayers on buildings and station wagons.
[00:14:50.857 --> 00:14:53.479]  City officials were kept in the dark about the tests.
[00:14:53.999 --> 00:15:00.222]  The Cold War cover story was that the Army was testing smoke screens to protect cities from a Russian attack.
[00:15:01.022 --> 00:15:04.764]  The truth, according to Martino Taylor, was much more sinister.
[00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:05.905]  It's pretty shocking.
[00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:09.707]  The level of duplicity and secrecy.
[00:15:12.008 --> 00:15:14.950]  Clearly they went to great lengths to deceive people.
[00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:24.455]  By making hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests, she uncovered once classified documents that confirmed the spraying of zinc cadmium sulfide.
[00:15:25.055 --> 00:15:30.977]  The greatest concentration of this compound was sprayed near the Pruitt-Igoe housing complex, just south of downtown St.
[00:15:31.017 --> 00:15:31.377]  Louis.
[00:15:31.937 --> 00:15:38.600]  It was home to 10,000 low-income people, and an estimated 70% were under the age of 12.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:48.623]  Martina Taylor claims they all unknowingly inhaled this compound morning, noon, and night, so the government could measure its effects on their lungs.
[00:15:48.923 --> 00:15:55.207]   So this is in violation of all medical ethics, All international codes and military zone policy at that time.
[00:15:55.968 --> 00:16:01.812]  In 1994, then-Congressman Richard Gephardt asked the Army to open its records and explain the St.
[00:16:01.852 --> 00:16:02.573]  Louis testing.
[00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:09.178]  We want to make very sure that nothing went on that would harm anyone and that all the facts are out on the table.
[00:16:09.679 --> 00:16:16.824]  Documents released in the 90s show the Army placed sprayers on this former Knights of Columbus building on Lindell and in Forest Park.
[00:16:17.545 --> 00:16:20.688]  The Army always insisted the chemical compound was safe.
[00:16:21.428 --> 00:16:24.450]  Martino-Taylor believes documents prove otherwise.
[00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:28.292]  There's a lot of evidence that indicates that people in St.
[00:16:28.312 --> 00:16:40.838]  Louis, in the city, particularly in minority communities, were subjected to military tests that was connected to a larger radiological weapons development and testing project.
[00:16:41.258 --> 00:16:43.619]  For the first time, she links the St.
[00:16:43.659 --> 00:16:46.019]  Louis testing to a company called U.S.
[00:16:46.099 --> 00:16:52.440]  Radium, a company notorious for lawsuits involving radioactive contamination of its workers.
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:17:10.104]  United States Radium had this reputation where they had been legally liable, found legally liable decades prior for producing a radioactive powdered paint that killed many young women who painted fluorescent watch tiles.
[00:17:10.731 --> 00:17:19.236]  While the Army admits it added a fluorescent substance to the zinc-cadmium compound, details of whether it was radioactive remain secret.
[00:17:20.037 --> 00:17:28.462]  Documents uncovered to date indicate the Army never conducted follow-up studies to see whether the compound caused long-term health issues.
[00:17:29.422 --> 00:17:38.428]  In 1972, after years of crime, poverty and decline, the government destroyed the Pruitt-Igoe housing complex.
[00:17:39.645 --> 00:17:41.191]  Lisa Zigman, News Channel 5, ITEAM.
[00:17:43.376 --> 00:17:44.376]  Now the company, U.S.
[00:17:44.436 --> 00:17:45.977]  Radium, no longer exists.
[00:17:46.137 --> 00:17:54.401]  Martino Taylor has placed all of her research, including the declassified documents, online and will link you to that data at ksdk.com.
[00:17:54.441 --> 00:17:57.502]  Now she will make all of her findings public tomorrow at St.
[00:17:57.542 --> 00:17:59.563]  Louis Community College Merrimack Campus.
[00:18:00.043 --> 00:18:05.185]  In the meantime, if you remember the spring, the I-Team's Lisa Zigman would like to hear from you.
[00:18:05.245 --> 00:18:08.266]  You can email her at lzigman at ksdk.com.
[00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:14.353]  Now remember, this is just a local news report.
[00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:17.975]  There's also a national Fox News report.
[00:18:19.895 --> 00:18:26.918]  And when you read the report, they are basically giving you nothing more than a whitewash.
[00:18:26.998 --> 00:18:28.178]  It's far worse than this.
[00:18:29.138 --> 00:18:34.140]  Oh, they told local officials that they were just, you know, blowing a smoke.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.120]  It's no big deal.
[00:18:36.141 --> 00:18:38.441]  The local officials told them it was just trucks that were doing it.
[00:18:40.606 --> 00:18:53.959]  A young lady remembers out on the baseball field, playing baseball, and over her flew a squadron of six green jets that sprayed them with a powder.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.301]  She went in and washed it off.
[00:18:57.963 --> 00:19:02.047]  And of course she then got cancer four times and most of her siblings died of cancer.
[00:19:03.388 --> 00:19:04.870]  And her daddy died as well.
[00:19:06.366 --> 00:19:13.486]   right after she was born. This is just one family. This is who the psychotics are that are basically
[00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:18.125]   in full control of our government at this point. So when they tell you they're giving you a quote
[00:19:18.125 --> 00:19:22.846]   shot so you don't get COVID, and then now they tell you a few years later actually you've had
[00:19:22.846 --> 00:19:27.646]   the shot, you're not protected, you need more shots, they're just hoping you don't go read
[00:19:27.646 --> 00:19:33.086]   the mainline studies showing that if you've had the shot you're more likely to get sick and die,
[00:19:33.086 --> 00:19:36.126]  not just of COVID, but of any other virus.
[00:19:36.242 --> 00:19:37.142]  So they've done it to us.
[00:19:37.803 --> 00:19:39.083]  They've rolled their operation out.
[00:19:39.824 --> 00:19:41.325]  And what does that really signify?
[00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:45.627]  These people are at war with us and they're going all the way.
[00:19:46.888 --> 00:19:53.152]  But the most important thing to understand is they're not just going to kill poor white people or black people, which is bad.
[00:19:54.634 --> 00:20:01.796]  Anyone serving this system should be smart enough to know you're not going to be exempt from something this massive.
[00:20:02.916 --> 00:20:10.819]  And of course, now they can use drones, drone helicopters, you name it, to deliver these compounds onto the population.
[00:20:11.579 --> 00:20:16.640]  And the people running the show are the Bill Gates's and Anthony Fauci's of the world.
[00:20:17.441 --> 00:20:18.121]  That's the reality.
[00:20:19.671 --> 00:20:25.234]  And so I'm glad this report came out because it just reminded me that what's old is new.
[00:20:25.294 --> 00:20:44.049]   We should really every week go back and just look at the different partially declassified admissions of this being done in Dallas, Texas or Albuquerque, New Mexico, or Los Angeles, California, or Miami, Florida, or New York City, or you name it.
[00:20:44.269 --> 00:20:50.456]  Every major town, every major city, many rural areas, this has been done everywhere.
[00:20:51.117 --> 00:20:54.201]  And not just with these poison chemicals and radioactive powders.
[00:20:55.442 --> 00:20:57.163]  God knows what they're doing now.
[00:20:57.383 --> 00:20:58.404]  We've got a good idea.
[00:20:59.084 --> 00:21:00.605]  We see life expectancy dropping.
[00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:01.985]  We see all the new diseases.
[00:21:02.526 --> 00:21:04.227]  Now they're saying young people get Alzheimer's.
[00:21:04.767 --> 00:21:07.388]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we're being soft killed.
[00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.769]  It's happening.
[00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:10.610]  We're living inside the New World Order.
[00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:20.577]  Now let's look at how this very establishment that's done all this is about to bring in the permanent emergency and how we can hopefully stop it if we admit the full horror of what we're facing.
[00:21:20.617 --> 00:21:25.581]  But please, once this live report is archived, it banned on video, which will be just a few hours.
[00:21:25.981 --> 00:21:28.443]  Share it like your life depends on it, because it does.
[00:21:30.484 --> 00:21:33.727]  Remember how we began this first hour today.
[00:21:35.478 --> 00:21:38.356]   The statement that Trump has made a thousand times is totally true.
[00:21:38.356 --> 00:21:40.478]  They're not coming after him.
[00:21:40.478 --> 00:21:42.837]  He's just in the way they're coming after you.
[00:21:42.837 --> 00:21:45.478]  They're coming after everybody.
[00:21:45.478 --> 00:21:51.397]   They don't want there to be an upwardly mobile, empowered country that can be an
[00:21:51.397 --> 00:21:52.997]  example to others living under tyranny.
[00:21:52.997 --> 00:21:57.398]   For the new world order to be able to take over, our Republic and the
[00:21:57.398 --> 00:21:58.958]  Western world must be destroyed.
[00:21:59.605 --> 00:22:05.952]  And that's why there's an organized corporate military intelligence agency attack on that.
[00:22:06.974 --> 00:22:09.236]  Now, talking to a lot of people I really respect.
[00:22:10.296 --> 00:22:14.637]  Like Jack Pasovic, one of the smartest people out there when it comes to analyzing the big picture.
[00:22:15.178 --> 00:22:16.238]  And I totally agree with him.
[00:22:16.978 --> 00:22:30.903]  The globalists are preparing us for a permanent emergency, not just a climate emergency, not just a gun violence emergency, not just an open border emergency, not just a defund the police crime explosion emergency, but a currency emergency.
[00:22:30.923 --> 00:22:32.584]  They have to bring down the old system.
[00:22:32.624 --> 00:22:39.546]  They have to pose as a savior to bring in the new world currency that tracks and controls everything we do.
[00:22:40.066 --> 00:22:44.007]  And this isn't Patriots telling us about this coming 20 years ago, who were right.
[00:22:44.727 --> 00:22:46.427]  This is happening now.
[00:22:47.507 --> 00:22:56.029]  And they're getting us ready with this escalation with Russia next year to perhaps even cancel the election.
[00:22:56.069 --> 00:23:01.910]  I think that clearly that's in the cards, but regardless, assassinations of Trump are on the table by the deep state.
[00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.991]  Assassinations of Biden are on the table again to blame.
[00:23:05.993 --> 00:23:07.213]  The populist movement.
[00:23:08.614 --> 00:23:10.174]  Massive false flag attacks.
[00:23:10.934 --> 00:23:12.375]  Racial false flag attacks.
[00:23:12.615 --> 00:23:14.935]  They're activating their fed-controlled Nazi groups.
[00:23:14.955 --> 00:23:15.875]  You see them everywhere.
[00:23:16.796 --> 00:23:19.096]  This is the time to be absolutely focused.
[00:23:19.776 --> 00:23:23.057]  Because all the previous evil we've seen is just the prep.
[00:23:23.397 --> 00:23:24.318]  But here's the good news.
[00:23:25.098 --> 00:23:29.379]  Over a month ago, I got the intel they were planning to roll back out the COVID hysteria.
[00:23:30.299 --> 00:23:32.901]  And now they've begun to roll it out.
[00:23:33.061 --> 00:23:34.963]  It's formed a massive opposition to it.
[00:23:35.664 --> 00:23:41.969]  So if we can get ahead of this and really get people aware of what's happening, the globalists won't be able to pull it off.
[00:23:42.009 --> 00:23:46.253]  They need the general public and most of Congress, who isn't part of it, to be unaware.
[00:23:47.173 --> 00:24:00.712]   But we're seeing more and more senators, more and more governors, more and more attorney generals come out against the globalists and point out they're setting up a dictatorship, a one-party Not just oligarchy, but more of a plutocracy.
[00:24:01.812 --> 00:24:09.358]  And later in the broadcast and over the next few days, I'll explain the different definitions that the globalists under their philosophy operate under.
[00:24:09.738 --> 00:24:21.807]  You have the tyrant system, you have the aristocracy system, you have plutocracy, and then of course you have mad rule of the mob, which they call pure democracy.
[00:24:22.247 --> 00:24:24.208]  And these are their definitions.
[00:24:24.989 --> 00:24:27.291]   We'll be laying it All out.
[00:24:27.391 --> 00:24:31.054]  But we see huge opposition to their new COVID rollout.
[00:24:32.075 --> 00:24:34.218]  And that's because we got ahead of it.
[00:24:34.898 --> 00:24:36.900]  And we've got to get ahead of this.
[00:24:37.481 --> 00:24:45.749]  We also see the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military saying they're going to launch terror attacks all over the world against anybody that's anti-World War III.
[00:24:45.949 --> 00:24:46.750]  But now U.S.
[00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.192]  senators are calling for major investigations.
[00:24:50.546 --> 00:25:01.855]  Including criminal investigation to see if national security information is being given to the Ukrainians and if indeed it's being used to target people that are dissidents not just here but around the world.
[00:25:01.935 --> 00:25:11.923]  But they're definitely preparing Ukrainian sleeper cells to stage false flags here and in Europe to be blamed on their political enemies.
[00:25:12.743 --> 00:25:18.228]  Now continuing, this whole thing has been set in motion.
[00:25:19.366 --> 00:25:23.834]  And the only way they can get away with this is if we don't realize that we're in a war.
[00:25:24.916 --> 00:25:26.479]  But if we realize that we're in a war...
[00:25:28.047 --> 00:25:40.354]  And if we mobilize and organize against it, and people understand the type of war we're facing, we have a very good chance of stopping this because they can, again, only get away with it if the public is politically ignorant to how this operates.
[00:25:40.994 --> 00:25:48.278]  Now, Owen Schroer is going to be sitting in in the next few days, but I'll be here following audio and video reports as well.
[00:25:48.338 --> 00:25:51.580]  He's got a ton of critical info he's going to be laying out.
[00:25:53.081 --> 00:26:01.123]  Without me even hammering it, and we have been talking about it a lot, but without me even hammering it, a lot of other major influencers who are very smart...
[00:26:02.528 --> 00:26:06.568]   Jack Basovic and Steve Bannon and many others are warning that they're planning to try to
[00:26:06.568 --> 00:26:07.568]  cancel the election.
[00:26:07.568 --> 00:26:11.169]  They're planning to outlaw their political opposition.
[00:26:11.169 --> 00:26:14.929]   They are really, really mobilizing because they know their old system is coming down
[00:26:14.929 --> 00:26:17.608]  now and they can't prop it up anymore.
[00:26:17.608 --> 00:26:22.867]   It was designed to collapse, but now the bubble's gotten so big they can't even keep it going.
[00:26:22.867 --> 00:26:25.407]  So that's why they're basically been painted into a corner.
[00:26:25.407 --> 00:26:28.887]   That's why we've got to be politically engaged so that instead of them getting more power
[00:26:28.887 --> 00:26:34.808]   out of this tyranny, this can be their political cultural waterloo and we can foreglow massive
[00:26:34.808 --> 00:26:36.808]  violence that they're planning.
[00:26:36.808 --> 00:26:39.489]  Separately, please remember we're literally supported.

[00:27:29.676 --> 00:27:36.459]  But in closing, in this segment, I want to just talk directly to all of you listening out there and ask you a question.
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:45.684]  After everything you've seen these criminals do, do you think you're going to be safer and healthier and wealthier and wiser if you roll over and go along with them?
[00:27:47.024 --> 00:27:51.126]  Or are you going to fully educate yourself on this and start educating others?
[00:27:52.087 --> 00:27:53.768]  Because sunlight is the disinfectant.
[00:27:54.622 --> 00:28:06.631]  We've got to spotlight these cockroaches, like Ted Nugent says, and we've got to reach out to God and pray to God to lead God and direct us.
[00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:09.983]   Because without God, We don't have hope.
[00:28:10.883 --> 00:28:12.624]  If we have God, no one can stand against us.
[00:28:12.664 --> 00:28:13.864]  But this is true evil.
[00:28:13.884 --> 00:28:15.485]  And we have to admit true evil exists.
[00:28:16.045 --> 00:28:17.886]  We have to understand this is not the legitimate government.
[00:28:18.666 --> 00:28:25.928]  This is the military-industrial complex controlled by a small technological corporate scientific elite that Eisenhower warned us about.
[00:28:26.928 --> 00:28:29.529]  Most people only talk about his military-industrial complex comment.
[00:28:30.069 --> 00:28:33.470]  He said, controlled by a technological elite.
[00:28:34.211 --> 00:28:35.511]  And that was in 1961.
[00:28:35.591 --> 00:28:37.051]  He was aware of what was going on.
[00:28:37.672 --> 00:28:38.892]  And he was warning people about it.
[00:28:40.214 --> 00:28:45.128]  So, these people think everybody else are animals, they think we're all stupid, they think we deserve to die.
[00:28:46.371 --> 00:28:47.752]  They are eugenics-based.
[00:28:48.072 --> 00:28:49.153]  It goes back to Plato.
[00:28:49.653 --> 00:28:55.437]  They're, quote, aristocrats who are not trying to empower and hold up society and build libraries and educate children.
[00:28:56.117 --> 00:29:02.441]  They're going against all that and trying to dumb us down so that we're more easily processed and gotten rid of.
[00:29:02.841 --> 00:29:06.603]  What did the head of the Club of Rome famously say just a few years ago?
[00:29:06.623 --> 00:29:07.684]  We played the club last week.
[00:29:08.504 --> 00:29:09.485]  In fact, Owen's coming up.
[00:29:09.505 --> 00:29:10.205]  We should play it again.
[00:29:10.225 --> 00:29:12.006]  In fact, we'll come out of break and play it.
[00:29:12.927 --> 00:29:17.693]   He said, I hope we can Depopulate the planet in a civil way.
[00:29:18.437 --> 00:29:20.185]  But he goes, but we're going to depopulate you.
[00:29:21.738 --> 00:29:24.279]  And again, the average white liberal goes, yo, there are too many people.
[00:29:24.699 --> 00:29:26.620]  Hey, dumbass, you're being fed the bugs.
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.941]  You're having your energy cut off.
[00:29:28.401 --> 00:29:29.901]  You're being sprayed with this stuff as well.
[00:29:30.221 --> 00:29:34.003]  It's the left that's targeted the most, that takes all the shots, that buys into it.
[00:29:34.903 --> 00:29:37.705]  So they believe they're promoting a utopia, they're promoting a dystopia.
[00:29:38.265 --> 00:29:40.986]  This is a war against humanity.
[00:29:41.286 --> 00:29:43.607]  This is the end of the world as we know it.
[00:29:44.047 --> 00:29:45.808]  Everything previous to this has been a buildup.
[00:29:46.148 --> 00:29:47.869]  We're going into the permanent emergency.
[00:29:48.669 --> 00:29:51.630]  So I'm going to ask listeners again to realize the power you've got right now.
[00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.851]  Take the live link to the show, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:29:55.231 --> 00:29:56.651]  Take the links off Bandai Video.
[00:29:56.851 --> 00:30:01.073]  When this report is archived at Bandai Video, share it like your life depends on it because it does.
[00:30:01.413 --> 00:30:02.293]  Take action now.
[00:30:02.613 --> 00:30:03.794]  Don't roll over and die.
[00:30:03.874 --> 00:30:05.874]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:05.874 --> 00:30:16.874]  [Music]
[00:30:16.874 --> 00:30:21.874]  And we are back live on this Monday edition.
[00:30:21.972 --> 00:30:28.997]  Here is Sir Dennis Meadows, one of the top tacticians and brains of the Globalists, one of the founders of the Club of Rome.
[00:30:30.097 --> 00:30:35.759]  Openly saying just a few years ago on national television that he hopes we can be depopulated in a civil way.
[00:30:35.779 --> 00:30:37.700]  What he's saying is don't fight back.
[00:30:38.501 --> 00:30:39.161]  Don't struggle.
[00:30:39.301 --> 00:30:41.782]  Just let us slowly poison you and kill you and get rid of you.
[00:30:42.302 --> 00:30:45.163]  Let us euthanize you and just give us the planet.
[00:30:45.944 --> 00:30:50.366]  It's not like the Borg showing up in a fictional Star Trek and saying you will be assimilated.
[00:30:50.926 --> 00:30:51.986]  Resistance is futile.
[00:30:52.347 --> 00:30:52.747]  No, no, no.
[00:30:52.767 --> 00:30:53.587]  You won't be assimilated.
[00:30:53.967 --> 00:30:54.848]  You'll be killed.
[00:30:55.868 --> 00:31:06.553]  And you just saw local Fox News, we have national Fox News, with the government spraying across the country, masses of people, with deadly compounds to give them cancer.
[00:31:07.634 --> 00:31:08.794]  And this was in the 50s.
[00:31:09.435 --> 00:31:10.355]  That was just the test.
[00:31:11.075 --> 00:31:13.236]  We're now living in the full operation.
[00:31:14.517 --> 00:31:16.638]  And so here he is saying, roll over and die.
[00:31:16.738 --> 00:31:19.520]  As for me and Infowars, I'm not rolling over and I'm not dying.
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:24.022]  Here is the wicked, wicked, in-your-face statement.
[00:31:27.797 --> 00:31:37.468]  So far, globally, you are so far above the population and the consumption levels which can be supported by this planet that I know in one way or another it's going to come back down.
[00:31:37.488 --> 00:31:39.390]  So I don't hope to avoid that.
[00:31:41.713 --> 00:31:55.625]   I hope that it can occur in a A civil way, and I mean civil in a special way, peaceful.
[00:31:56.546 --> 00:32:09.235]  Peace doesn't mean that everybody's happy, but it means that conflict isn't solved through violence, through force, but rather in other ways.
[00:32:09.436 --> 00:32:23.594]   And so that's what I hope for, that we can, I mean, The planet can support something like a billion people.
[00:32:25.895 --> 00:32:31.836]  Maybe two billion, depending on how much liberty and how much material consumption you want to have.
[00:32:31.856 --> 00:32:37.457]  If you want more liberty and more consumption, you have to have fewer people.
[00:32:38.097 --> 00:32:40.538]  And conversely, you can have more people.
[00:32:40.558 --> 00:32:48.641]   I mean, we could even have Eight or nine billion, probably, if we have a very strong dictatorship, which is smart.
[00:32:49.181 --> 00:32:51.603]  Unfortunately, you never have smart dictatorships.
[00:32:51.623 --> 00:32:52.644]  They're always stupid.
[00:32:52.905 --> 00:32:56.988]  But if you had a smart dictatorship and a low standard of living, you could have it.
[00:32:57.509 --> 00:33:00.151]  But we want to have freedom and we want to have a high sense.
[00:33:00.491 --> 00:33:01.793]  So we're going to have a billion people.
[00:33:02.233 --> 00:33:03.094]  And we're now at seven.
[00:33:03.734 --> 00:33:04.775]  So we have to get back down.
[00:33:05.536 --> 00:33:08.058]  I hope that this can be slow, relatively slow.
[00:33:09.136 --> 00:33:22.664]  And that it can be done in a way which is relatively equal, you know, so that people share the experience and you don't have a few rich, you know, trying to force everybody else to deal with it.
[00:33:22.724 --> 00:33:23.624]  So those are my hopes.
[00:33:23.684 --> 00:33:38.453]  I mean, these are pretty pessimistic hopes, you know, but that's... All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are now live inside the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:33:39.946 --> 00:33:51.722]  Now, I've got to respond to that video, and I'll try to summarize my response in the five minutes we have remaining in this segment.
[00:33:53.285 --> 00:33:54.606]  There's a lot of breaking news right now.
[00:33:54.646 --> 00:34:08.376]  We are going to be covering the continued resolution vote, government shutdown vote, the infighting inside the Republican Party for those that want to go along and get along, and then the others like Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert saying, no, enough is enough.
[00:34:08.736 --> 00:34:10.858]  Let's just stop the government spending.
[00:34:11.018 --> 00:34:14.100]  It's better than continuing it just to play politics.
[00:34:15.741 --> 00:34:19.004]  The panic inside the Democrat Party because Trump is surging.
[00:34:19.044 --> 00:34:21.906]  We got all that, but let's respond to what we just heard on that video.
[00:34:22.859 --> 00:34:34.225]  And to put it simply is to just say that is what intellectualism without God sounds like.
[00:34:36.166 --> 00:34:44.230]  That is philosophical intellectualism without the belief in creation sounds like.
[00:34:46.671 --> 00:35:13.474]   Because if you don't believe or know That we are a divine creation of God, and that this consciousness, this gift of life, is something beyond our understanding, perhaps even, outside of the subtle clues that the Creator has given us, or the not-so-subtle clues that these individuals don't seem to pick up on.
[00:35:13.894 --> 00:35:15.415]  That's what it sounds like.
[00:35:17.296 --> 00:35:26.412]   It's just Like trying to ration out food or water.
[00:35:26.613 --> 00:35:45.627]  Let's say if you're stranded on the ocean in a lifeboat and you've got X amount of people and X amount of supplies and now you have to intellectually come to terms and say this is how we're rationing this, this is how we're going to survive, this is the best path forward.
[00:35:47.025 --> 00:35:51.851]  And so that's how these globalists look at the world.
[00:35:52.752 --> 00:36:01.844]  We're essentially on a survival raft, floating through deep space, and so we have to ration what we have left on this planet.
[00:36:02.365 --> 00:36:05.128]  And that's what the man-made climate change hoax is all about.
[00:36:06.175 --> 00:36:12.659]  That's what the medical tyranny, World Health Organization, COVID, biological weapons, everything else, that's what it's all about.
[00:36:12.879 --> 00:36:17.202]  That's what all the agenda is really all about, exactly what he just said right there.
[00:36:17.602 --> 00:36:21.825]  And they believe they're intellectually and philosophically superior to you.
[00:36:22.165 --> 00:36:30.311]  But of course, if you can't see that we are living in a divine creation, then you really go back down to zero, don't you?
[00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:44.802]  So all that philosophy, all that intellectualism, you think you're smarter than everybody else, you figured out we're on a life raft in deep space and so you're going to be the stewards of humanity, rationing off goods and services and resources.
[00:36:44.842 --> 00:36:48.803]  Well actually you go back down to zero that you don't realize this is a divine creation.
[00:36:49.304 --> 00:36:59.248]  And so there's two elements I would say that are the most important to getting ahead of this in our own understanding.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:04.763]  That is, the theory of evolution is a lie.
[00:37:05.843 --> 00:37:07.905]  The theory of evolution is a lie.
[00:37:07.985 --> 00:37:11.047]  Now, I'm not saying evolution is a lie.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.981]  But as it's presented to us, it is a complete fabrication.
[00:37:16.741 --> 00:37:26.864]  And in fact, we do have historical, archaeological, and all kinds of data, research, and analysis that proves the theory of evolution.
[00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:31.766]  It's just that a theory actually now has been disproven.
[00:37:33.226 --> 00:37:45.830]   One of the greatest individuals to Do the work in disproving this, and Graham Hancock didn't invest all of his time and life to disproving the theory of evolution.
[00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:56.136]  Graham Hancock did all this research in his life just because he genuinely was curious about the history of this planet and human life on it.
[00:37:57.156 --> 00:38:02.919]  But in that process, with all the work he's done in his decades of research, he has completely disproven the theory of evolution.
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:21.446]   And in fact, we know That there have been civilizations on this planet that were either as advanced technologically as we are now, as advanced in their intellect as we are now, or even more so.
[00:38:22.946 --> 00:38:36.804]   Now, the individuals that believe it's their job to ration resources on this planet, and as he explained in the clip, get humanity down to a survivable population level, Do they even know about this stuff?
[00:38:36.824 --> 00:38:37.905]  Do they care about this stuff?
[00:38:38.665 --> 00:38:39.886]  Maybe they do, maybe they don't.
[00:38:41.248 --> 00:38:49.034]  But this is why, this is why, and let's bring it home now, this is why the Bill of Rights, the U.S.
[00:38:49.074 --> 00:38:54.118]  Constitution, and the Free Market Republic must stand.
[00:38:54.679 --> 00:38:57.161]  Because it's the only thing that stands in their way, folks.
[00:38:57.881 --> 00:38:58.422]  What did he say?
[00:38:58.462 --> 00:39:00.243]  Well, peace doesn't always mean happiness.
[00:39:01.164 --> 00:39:24.678]   Well, I don't know if I completely agree with that, but If I have a birthright to be free, and you have a birthright to be free, and we have an entire country of people that have a birthright to be free working to form a better republic, a better union, well then they can't ration our lives, they can't dictate our future, and they can't murder our lineage.
[00:39:25.519 --> 00:39:29.920]  Which is what they want to do, and that's why they have to destroy the United States of America.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.261]  Did I do it in five minutes?
[00:39:31.481 --> 00:39:32.021]  Not so bad!
[00:39:33.024 --> 00:39:47.935]  Imagine being so cold and heartless and out of touch with the deeper spirituality that is this human consciousness, this experience we call life.
[00:39:50.097 --> 00:39:59.684]  Imagine being so cold and out of touch with that, that you just get up there and callously say, yeah, we need to get eight billion people down to one.
[00:40:00.905 --> 00:40:02.286]  Hope we can do it slow, but you know.
[00:40:05.188 --> 00:40:05.528]  Wow.
[00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:09.231]  You really have no clue, do ya?
[00:40:11.052 --> 00:40:12.973]  You think you've got it figured out, you don't.
[00:40:16.195 --> 00:40:18.897]  But that's where we're at.
[00:40:20.598 --> 00:40:31.065]  And I guess being that cold, being that dispiritual, is the only way you could land on those conclusions.
[00:40:32.246 --> 00:40:46.112]   Or be such An arrogant control freak to believe that you should now be the ones to make decisions for 8 billion people on the planet and turn them into slaves.
[00:40:46.472 --> 00:41:00.585]  You know, maybe ultimately if we had a deeper understanding of our history, maybe that's what's always been driving these factors of human sacrifice and torment and enslavement.
[00:41:02.867 --> 00:41:10.692]  That same cold callous intellectual philosophy that there's limited resources on this planet and they're mine.
[00:41:15.575 --> 00:41:21.819]  I guess in a way, I guess in a way it's really just raw survivalism.
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:28.523]  But again, it's cold and it's out of touch with the deeper meaning.
[00:41:30.452 --> 00:41:39.634]  That I suppose these globalists, like Bill Gates, the Club of Rome, and so many others, I suppose they've completely lost.
[00:41:41.455 --> 00:41:43.795]  They've completely lost that divine spirituality.
[00:41:43.835 --> 00:41:57.179]  But I don't want to wax on that for the rest of the show, because there is a lot of big breaking news today, including an ongoing battle right now in Washington, D.C.
[00:41:59.346 --> 00:42:17.980]  When it comes to this continued resolution bill, and you have a small handful of Republicans, and it's the same Freedom Caucus group, with a little bit of a difference than, say, when they were trying to keep McCarthy out as the Speaker.
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.042]  But essentially, it's the same group.
[00:42:21.863 --> 00:42:22.904]  And they're saying, you know what?
[00:42:24.105 --> 00:42:25.106]  We're done with this.
[00:42:26.006 --> 00:42:27.948]  It's time to just cut this government funding.
[00:42:29.648 --> 00:42:34.890]  And if we don't want to engage in serious negotiations, then what are we even doing here?
[00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:53.218]   If we don't want to use, this is Republicans under the House leadership of Kevin McCarthy, or lack thereof I should say, The lack of leadership from Kevin McCarthy saying, if we're not going to use the power of the purse, then what are we even doing here?
[00:42:54.019 --> 00:43:13.007]  If we're going to go up there and flap our gums about how corrupt the Biden administration and how out of control the Democrats are with their policies, the open borders, the showing the children porn and everything else, but we're not going to actually leverage the power we have right now with the control of the House, then what are we even doing here?
[00:43:14.633 --> 00:43:17.675]  But see, this is the exposure.
[00:43:19.177 --> 00:43:20.558]  This is the answer to that question.
[00:43:20.618 --> 00:43:21.719]  What are we actually doing here?
[00:43:21.919 --> 00:43:24.200]  Well, most Republicans aren't really doing a damn thing.
[00:43:25.001 --> 00:43:27.083]  They're showing up, and that's about it.
[00:43:28.364 --> 00:43:30.045]  They're going along to get along.
[00:43:30.325 --> 00:43:34.589]  But that brand of Republican is dying.
[00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:53.748]   And I think right now you're looking at, I believe, if there's going to be any hope Inside the Republican Party, to try to save or conserve what we have here in the United States of America, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, a border?
[00:43:54.569 --> 00:43:55.469]  Common sense?
[00:43:58.491 --> 00:44:12.217]  I don't know if this is going to be the final battle, but this is certainly a major one happening right now, and Matt Gaetz, what he's doing, what he's saying, and how it resonates and populates the Americans is going to be essential.
[00:44:14.673 --> 00:44:18.876]  House GOP fights to win over members on StopGap to prevent shutdown.
[00:44:20.297 --> 00:44:26.481]  And so they propose these bills and Kevin McCarthy wants to have his cake and eat it too.
[00:44:28.442 --> 00:44:32.885]  He's saying, look, we can get this deal done and we can cut into the government spending.
[00:44:33.665 --> 00:44:41.570]  Well, if you have cancer and your doctor comes up to you and says, you have terminal cancer, you're going to be dead in two years.
[00:44:42.711 --> 00:44:45.353]  And you say, well, okay, Doc, what are my options?
[00:44:46.213 --> 00:44:52.157]  And he says, well, we can either stop the cancer 100% or here's my proposal.
[00:44:52.297 --> 00:44:54.199]  I say we stop 8% of the cancer.
[00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:54.779]  How about that?
[00:44:55.099 --> 00:44:56.260]  I think 8% is good, right?
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.121]  We'll just cut 8% of the cancer.
[00:44:58.381 --> 00:45:01.143]  You're going to sit there and you're going to say, I need to get a new doctor.
[00:45:03.325 --> 00:45:05.206]  That's essentially Kevin McCarthy today.
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.581]  And the majority of the Republicans in the House.
[00:45:08.921 --> 00:45:15.665]  Now granted, I believe most of those Republicans, if they had real leadership, they would support whatever the leader was doing.
[00:45:16.265 --> 00:45:18.467]  So they just support McCarthy to go along to get along.
[00:45:18.747 --> 00:45:25.270]  But Kevin McCarthy knows this country has cancer, and Kevin McCarthy's proposal is to cut out 8% of the cancer.
[00:45:26.911 --> 00:45:33.215]  Again, if your doctor told you you got cancer but he only wants to get rid of 8% of it, you'd go find a new doctor.
[00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:36.591]  So I think it's time for us to find a new doctor.
[00:45:40.093 --> 00:45:43.054]  We've given Kevin McCarthy far too many chances.
[00:45:43.454 --> 00:45:50.618]  Now, my two... You could argue it's too little too late at this point to do any changes of House leadership, and that's perfectly fine.
[00:45:52.691 --> 00:46:05.620]  But we should take this as a lesson into the next round of Congress, hoping Republicans maintain the House and say, no, no more Kevin McCarthy, no more squish Republican House leadership.
[00:46:05.901 --> 00:46:07.382]  We want somebody who's the real deal.
[00:46:07.422 --> 00:46:13.646]  And right now it's Matt Gaetz who's leading that charge, who I think is vying for that position of leadership.
[00:46:15.548 --> 00:46:16.388]  Now, here are the 15 names.
[00:46:20.532 --> 00:46:22.914]  Saying no to cutting out 8% of the cancer.
[00:46:24.876 --> 00:46:26.657]  And this is an ongoing development here.
[00:46:27.158 --> 00:46:30.381]  This is a constantly changing and updating development.
[00:46:30.861 --> 00:46:36.085]  So this is just the latest list that I have from an hour or two ago.
[00:46:36.266 --> 00:46:37.567]  Things are constantly changing.
[00:46:38.848 --> 00:46:42.791]  Here's the list of no's on only cut out 8% of the cancer.
[00:46:45.575 --> 00:46:47.957]  Andy Biggs, Dan Bishop, Lauren Boebert.
[00:46:48.077 --> 00:46:48.997]  Oh, there's that name.
[00:46:49.558 --> 00:46:51.019]  We might have to talk about that name.
[00:46:51.619 --> 00:46:55.842]  Lauren Boebert voted for it, but oh, oh, oh, I'm a big, I'm a big conservative.
[00:46:55.982 --> 00:46:59.945]  I need to get Lauren Boebert out because she smoked a vape and she got groped at Beetlejuice.
[00:47:00.225 --> 00:47:01.326]  Hehehehehehehe!
[00:47:02.447 --> 00:47:04.568]  I'm so much smarter and intellectual.
[00:47:04.909 --> 00:47:08.311]  I'm more conservative than you because I'm coming for Lauren Boebert.
[00:47:08.391 --> 00:47:09.252]  Ooh, look at me.
[00:47:10.811 --> 00:47:13.091]  Oh, and there she is voting for us yet again.
[00:47:13.452 --> 00:47:15.172]  So let's just get rid of that vote, right?
[00:47:16.272 --> 00:47:17.192]  So sick of this crap.
[00:47:17.212 --> 00:47:18.032]  We'll have more on that later.
[00:47:18.312 --> 00:47:28.794]  Ken Buck, Tim Burchett, Eli Crane, Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Corey Mills, Ralph Norman, Andy Ogles, Matt Rosendale, Victoria Spartz, Anna Paulina Luna.
[00:47:29.275 --> 00:47:41.177]   Anna Paulina Luna, who just gave birth, has more fight in her Then 90% of Republicans in Congress, and then Paul Gosar.
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:52.268]  I mean, you, let me just tell you, when Anna Paulina gives birth and then is fighting for this country right afterwards, I mean, tip of the cap.
[00:47:53.649 --> 00:47:54.390]  Tip of the cap.
[00:47:55.171 --> 00:47:59.935]  More fighting her than the average Republican man in Congress, and she just had a baby.
[00:48:01.637 --> 00:48:02.578]  It's just crazy.
[00:48:03.936 --> 00:48:15.681]  But that's, I mean, I don't know if that's more a testament to how awesome Anna Paulina Luna is, or more of a testament on how pathetic the average Republican representative is.
[00:48:17.102 --> 00:48:24.345]  Now you didn't hear Byron Donald's name on that list, and he eventually did give in to the House leadership of Kevin McCarthy during the vote, and now again today.
[00:48:24.385 --> 00:48:26.146]  And I still like Byron Donald, just to be clear.
[00:48:26.186 --> 00:48:27.427]  I still think he's one of the good ones.
[00:48:28.467 --> 00:48:34.594]   But he's for this continued resolution to keep the government spending, and look, Because we're getting a little politically wonky here.
[00:48:35.674 --> 00:48:39.395]  And conservatives and Republicans have a major messaging problem.
[00:48:39.695 --> 00:48:41.496]  And that's part of the problems that we face.
[00:48:42.096 --> 00:48:43.797]  Is that we do have a messaging problem.
[00:48:44.437 --> 00:48:47.258]  And most common sense conservatives are just common sense Americans.
[00:48:47.878 --> 00:48:52.360]  They don't even know what's going on because Republicans don't even know how to message them.
[00:48:54.921 --> 00:48:58.042]  The House of Representatives controls the government purse.
[00:49:00.037 --> 00:49:06.360]  So, if the Republican Party controls the House of Representatives, they can cut that funding off at any minute!
[00:49:07.821 --> 00:49:12.363]  Now, you explain that power to the average American, that's going to resonate.
[00:49:12.383 --> 00:49:18.106]  They're going to say, oh, you mean, like Democrats think it's this thing, oh, shutting down the government is a negative thing.
[00:49:18.146 --> 00:49:20.087]  Shutting down the government, Americans don't like that.
[00:49:20.247 --> 00:49:21.108]  Uh, yeah they do!
[00:49:22.429 --> 00:49:25.030]  You think Americans like government?
[00:49:29.457 --> 00:49:33.360]  It's in our blood to despise government.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.182]  It's in the founding of this country.
[00:49:36.562 --> 00:49:43.507]  It's in our founding documents to have contempt for tyrannical governments.
[00:49:46.429 --> 00:49:49.551]  I've gone long, but I'm going to come back and explain what's going on here.
[00:49:51.232 --> 00:49:55.495]  On the other side of this break, it's the Alex Jones Show, brought to you by Infowarsstore.com.

[00:51:25.869 --> 00:51:29.510]  You know, I wonder.
[00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:39.510]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:35.123]  If you just ask the average American, hey, do you think we should shut down the U.S.
[00:51:35.183 --> 00:51:35.603]  government?
[00:51:36.263 --> 00:51:36.944]  Do you think the U.S.
[00:51:36.984 --> 00:51:39.546]  government is out of control and their spending is out of control?
[00:51:41.187 --> 00:51:43.148]  I wonder what the average American would say.
[00:51:43.369 --> 00:51:51.294]  I think that they would probably, maybe by a small margin, but I think most would support that, as long as the messaging was correct.
[00:51:51.334 --> 00:51:53.155]  But see, the Republicans have horrible messaging.
[00:51:54.116 --> 00:51:56.998]  By the way, where is Ronna Romney McDaniel during any of this?
[00:51:57.098 --> 00:51:57.818]  Nowhere to be found.
[00:51:57.858 --> 00:51:58.299]  What's new?
[00:51:58.939 --> 00:51:59.980]  She's great at that.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.082]  I gotta tell ya, she is great at disappearing.
[00:52:04.042 --> 00:52:05.643]  Man, isn't that amazing?
[00:52:05.703 --> 00:52:07.444]  Don't you love that out of a leader too?
[00:52:07.685 --> 00:52:11.127]  You're always thinking, man, I just wish I had a leader that knew how to disappear.
[00:52:12.426 --> 00:52:19.351]  I just wish I had a leader that knew how to completely disappear when we needed that leader the most, when the most important times were ahead of us.
[00:52:19.431 --> 00:52:23.234]  I just wish we had somebody that could just vanish and be nowhere to be found.
[00:52:23.534 --> 00:52:29.018]  That's Ronna Romney McDaniel for you.
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:36.064]  So here's the continued resolution proposed by the Republicans, and they think this is some kind of a victory.
[00:52:36.144 --> 00:52:41.588]  I mean, yeah, I mean, I guess it's a victory if you just want to slow your death.
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.961]  The 30-day continued resolution.
[00:52:45.021 --> 00:52:46.722]  And see, here's another problem.
[00:52:46.742 --> 00:52:49.703]  Again, I just don't... There's no leadership here.
[00:52:50.464 --> 00:52:52.184]  The Republicans have a messaging problem.
[00:52:53.645 --> 00:52:59.228]  They don't even know how to communicate in basic communication skills.
[00:52:59.268 --> 00:53:01.929]  I mean, folks, this is communication 101.
[00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:04.690]  This is communication 101.
[00:53:09.417 --> 00:53:15.420]  When they say the 30-day CR does two things, how many people in this audience know what CR means?
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:16.920]  I'm not trying to be rude.
[00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:19.361]  This is political wonk.
[00:53:21.282 --> 00:53:24.143]  How many people know what CR means?
[00:53:25.004 --> 00:53:27.184]  Less than half.
[00:53:27.385 --> 00:53:27.705]  If even 10%!
[00:53:29.445 --> 00:53:32.347]  Why are you tweeting out the 30-day CR does two things?
[00:53:32.787 --> 00:53:34.588]  Nobody knows what you're talking about.
[00:53:34.868 --> 00:53:37.409]  Why don't we have clear, basic communication skills?
[00:53:38.476 --> 00:53:41.118]  This goes beyond just Republicans in Congress.
[00:53:41.138 --> 00:53:43.559]  I mean, it's basically our language is being destroyed.
[00:53:43.779 --> 00:53:45.700]  We don't even know how to properly communicate anymore.
[00:53:48.182 --> 00:53:50.763]  The 30-day continued resolution.
[00:53:52.084 --> 00:53:53.765]  Continued resolution.
[00:53:54.845 --> 00:53:59.928]  Meaning, we're not going to shut down the government, and this is the bill that's going to do it.
[00:54:00.028 --> 00:54:04.211]  This is the continued resolution, and then here are the agreements.
[00:54:07.193 --> 00:54:09.715]  We ought to learn how to communicate better.
[00:54:11.416 --> 00:54:12.718]  Secure the southern border.
[00:54:13.078 --> 00:54:13.919]  You really believe that?
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:22.265]  Who here, who here really believes that this continued resolution is going to secure the southern border?
[00:54:23.126 --> 00:54:23.887]  Yeah, right.
[00:54:24.647 --> 00:54:25.568]  Yeah, sure it will.
[00:54:25.748 --> 00:54:26.989]  Hell yeah.
[00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:32.674]  The Biden administration is making it illegal to have border walls.
[00:54:32.954 --> 00:54:35.757]  They're making it illegal to have a barrier whatsoever.
[00:54:37.489 --> 00:54:39.129]  So Arizona tried to get creative.
[00:54:39.149 --> 00:54:44.531]  They said, well, let's just use these old shipping crates and we'll just turn that into a makeshift wall.
[00:54:44.571 --> 00:54:46.431]  And then, you know, technically it's not a wall.
[00:54:46.491 --> 00:54:47.552]  It's just trash at the border.
[00:54:48.052 --> 00:54:50.712]  The Biden administration doesn't clean up any of the other trash at the border.
[00:54:50.752 --> 00:54:53.733]  So let's just go put these crates down there as a makeshift wall.
[00:54:53.773 --> 00:54:54.633]  And it'll just be like trash.
[00:54:54.974 --> 00:54:56.514]  And the Biden administration banned it.
[00:54:58.738 --> 00:55:01.600]  Okay, so then Texas said, well, we'll get a little creative.
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:03.040]  We'll do something here at a state level.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.521]  We'll put floating barriers out in the water.
[00:55:06.222 --> 00:55:08.383]  And maybe that can deter some of the illegal immigration.
[00:55:09.423 --> 00:55:11.124]  And the Biden administration banned it.
[00:55:11.144 --> 00:55:12.165]  Now they're fighting in court.
[00:55:13.305 --> 00:55:15.326]  They tried to put up barbed wire at the border.
[00:55:15.366 --> 00:55:16.347]  Just a basic barrier.
[00:55:16.387 --> 00:55:17.587]  Biden administration banned it.
[00:55:17.627 --> 00:55:19.128]  Sent Border Patrol down there to clean it up.
[00:55:19.508 --> 00:55:21.149]  So they don't clean up any of the trash.
[00:55:21.289 --> 00:55:21.990]  I mean, I've been down there.
[00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.810]  There's trash everywhere.
[00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:23.610]  They don't clean that up.
[00:55:23.871 --> 00:55:26.432]  They clean up the barriers and say, we need to clean up this trash.
[00:55:28.167 --> 00:55:38.218]  And I'm going to sit here like a fool and believe that this continued resolution is going to stop the invasion of the southern border?
[00:55:38.558 --> 00:55:40.541]  How dumb do you think I am?
[00:55:40.941 --> 00:55:46.247]  And then it says it's going to cut government spending by 8% and there's going to be no Ukraine money.
[00:55:49.022 --> 00:55:52.303]  This is a losing bill up one side and down the other.
[00:55:52.984 --> 00:55:58.366]  And the fact that Republicans in Congress are trying to convince you otherwise is pathetic.
[00:55:58.886 --> 00:56:00.147]  And I like Byron Donalds.
[00:56:00.787 --> 00:56:02.027]  I think he's a great representative.
[00:56:02.067 --> 00:56:04.408]  But Byron, you're not fooling me.
[00:56:05.369 --> 00:56:06.549]  You're not fooling anybody.
[00:56:06.569 --> 00:56:10.431]  Alright, we're into hour number two here of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:10.851 --> 00:56:11.812]  Owen Schroer filling in.
[00:56:12.072 --> 00:56:20.439]   I'm getting a little politically wonky today, only because I'm not going to be sitting here I'm not going to sit here and be made a fool of.
[00:56:20.559 --> 00:56:23.481]  I'm not going to sit here because here's the thing.
[00:56:23.561 --> 00:56:25.882]  We have made end roads.
[00:56:25.942 --> 00:56:37.931]  We have a beachhead in the Republican Party where we can actually peacefully, politically, legally, lawfully try to save our country, which is the goal.
[00:56:39.732 --> 00:56:58.392]   So yeah, if we can take control of the Republican Party with people that actually have common sense And have basic conservative political values, then yeah, absolutely we should support that movement.
[00:56:59.012 --> 00:57:08.840]  And what's going on today with this continued resolution and the threat of a government shutdown is the perfect example of when it's time to get politically involved.
[00:57:10.762 --> 00:57:24.134]   Now, I understand There are things called pyrrhic victories, or sometimes you have to take the loss to get the greater win.
[00:57:25.555 --> 00:57:29.637]  All kinds of examples of this throughout human history.
[00:57:32.419 --> 00:57:34.760]  It's kind of like, you know, it's one of my favorite movies.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:35.640]  Have you ever seen the movie 300?
[00:57:37.605 --> 00:57:45.447]  Where King Leonidas takes his 300 men and he says, well, if they assassinate the king, then they'll have an entire army to deal with.
[00:57:45.667 --> 00:57:50.629]  So he knew, he knew he was going to go in there and take a loss, but ultimately that was going to mean a victory for his people.
[00:57:51.889 --> 00:57:52.890]  So, so I get that.
[00:57:55.150 --> 00:58:00.592]  And I, but I don't know if this is the time to be doing that right now with the House Republicans.
[00:58:01.792 --> 00:58:06.594]  So if you want to take that strategy, you'd say, okay, fine.
[00:58:08.706 --> 00:58:20.570]  Okay, fine, as Byron Donalds is selling us this today, that the continued resolution will secure the southern border, cut government spending by 8%, and no money will go to Ukraine.
[00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:21.991]  I'd say, okay, fine.
[00:58:22.151 --> 00:58:22.771]  Fine, Byron.
[00:58:23.952 --> 00:58:24.272]  Fine.
[00:58:25.052 --> 00:58:35.116]  We'll accept your continued resolution, and I guarantee you, hell, it'll even happen within the 30 days, and they claim, well, it's not going to happen within 30 days.
[00:58:35.136 --> 00:58:35.536]  Oh, it will.
[00:58:37.461 --> 00:58:56.886]  I guarantee you, I guarantee you, if you take, if the Republicans in the House take the continued resolution, there will still be hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants pouring over the southern border, and the Biden administration will find a way to send more money to Ukraine.
[00:58:58.126 --> 00:58:58.426]  Okay?
[00:59:01.243 --> 00:59:01.823]  100% guarantee.
[00:59:02.624 --> 00:59:07.185]  I will 100% guarantee that for you right here today.
[00:59:08.505 --> 00:59:10.666]  And Byron Donalds has to know that.
[00:59:12.026 --> 00:59:13.506]  He has to know that that's the truth.
[00:59:15.087 --> 00:59:18.247]  So why he's playing politics with this, I don't know.
[00:59:19.428 --> 00:59:20.408]  But come on, Byron.
[00:59:21.528 --> 00:59:22.448]  Everybody knows that.
[00:59:24.229 --> 00:59:25.149]  Everybody knows that.
[00:59:26.786 --> 00:59:30.750]  There is nothing you can do to stop the southern border invasion right now.
[00:59:31.411 --> 00:59:35.596]  And there's nothing you can do to stop the Biden administration from sending more money to Ukraine.
[00:59:36.836 --> 00:59:42.197]   And so the only strategy you have to take is win-at-all-cost strategy.
[00:59:42.197 --> 00:59:51.157]  Now this is an ongoing situation.
[00:59:51.291 --> 00:59:54.372]  Matt Gaetz is taking the leadership role that we need.
[00:59:54.432 --> 01:00:01.454]  Matt Gaetz is taking the leadership role that Kevin McCarthy claimed he wanted to take, but then just became a swamp creature.
[01:00:03.435 --> 01:00:06.536]  Gaetz tweeting out, Kevin McCarthy opposition is growing.
[01:00:08.416 --> 01:00:14.298]  Victoria Spartz issues a statement opposing lack of leadership by Kevin McCarthy.
[01:00:15.523 --> 01:00:21.449]  Victoria Sparks issued the following statement on her opposition to the proposed continued resolution deal.
[01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:28.036]  Unfortunately, real leadership takes courage and willingness to fight for the country, not for power and a picture on a wall.
[01:00:28.477 --> 01:00:28.637]  Ooh!
[01:00:29.858 --> 01:00:36.526]  The Republican House is failing the American people again and pursuing a path of gamesmanship and circus.
[01:00:36.746 --> 01:00:37.627]  Oh, she's nailing it.
[01:00:38.467 --> 01:00:44.328]  Neither Republicans nor Democrats have the backbone to challenge the corrupt swamp that is bankrupting our children and grandchildren.
[01:00:44.768 --> 01:00:52.429]  It is a shame that our weak speaker cannot even commit to having a commission to discuss our looming fiscal catastrophe.
[01:00:53.130 --> 01:01:06.092]  Our founding fathers would be rolling over in their graves to see how this institution is betraying our republic, her personal political ambitions, and our children will be ashamed of another worthless Congress.
[01:01:07.202 --> 01:01:09.723]  Representative Victoria Sparks, Indiana District 5.
[01:01:11.624 --> 01:01:14.866]  Well, that sums it up pretty well, doesn't it?
[01:01:16.947 --> 01:01:20.529]  And she was one of the 15 no votes on this continued resolution.
[01:01:20.569 --> 01:01:22.050]  And it is a small margin in the House.
[01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:26.832]  I think it's like 11 or 12 that as long as they stay in opposition, they can't get anything through.
[01:01:26.852 --> 01:01:33.293]   It's just like the Freedom Caucus during McCarthy's Battle and vote to become the Speaker.
[01:01:34.613 --> 01:01:40.815]  And what a phony, what a phony, bag of fluff, empty suit Kevin McCarthy ends up being.
[01:01:42.036 --> 01:01:48.138]  He fought tooth and nail, he scratched and clawed to be the Speaker of the House, and now he is, and he's doing what?
[01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:49.418]  Nothing.
[01:01:50.719 --> 01:01:51.139]  Nothing.
[01:01:52.519 --> 01:01:56.361]  So, to me there's two theories of thought here.
[01:01:58.413 --> 01:02:03.418]  You say, OK, and maybe this is how Matt Gaetz could play it if he feels he's going to lose these votes.
[01:02:04.719 --> 01:02:05.780]  You say, OK, fine.
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.121]  Fine, McCarthy.
[01:02:08.623 --> 01:02:10.484]  We'll give you your continued resolution.
[01:02:11.746 --> 01:02:14.648]  But I'm going to come out and I'm going to make a guarantee right now.
[01:02:15.689 --> 01:02:16.810]  And you could even, I mean.
[01:02:18.832 --> 01:02:22.276]  You could really throw some weight around and say, hey, Kevin.
[01:02:23.536 --> 01:02:29.219]  You can have my vote, and I'll convince all the other Republicans in the House to vote for your continued resolution bill.
[01:02:29.479 --> 01:02:29.799]  But!
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:30.980]  But!
[01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:41.526]  If in the next 30 days, the Biden administration sends more money to Ukraine, and another illegal immigrant crosses the southern border, you have to step down as Speaker.
[01:02:42.773 --> 01:03:01.841]  Well that's one way to get rid of Kevin McCarthy because you know and I know and Kevin McCarthy knows and everybody inside the Republican House knows that this continued resolution will not stop a single illegal immigrant and it will not stop a single dime from being sent to Ukraine by the Biden administration.
[01:03:02.141 --> 01:03:03.742]  Who do you think you're kidding?
[01:03:05.663 --> 01:03:08.064]  Who do you think you're kidding?
[01:03:12.148 --> 01:03:16.371]  And you know, maybe I should use this opportunity to address this Lauren Boebert situation here.
[01:03:19.434 --> 01:03:22.597]  Because you notice how she's always voting the right way?
[01:03:23.597 --> 01:03:26.340]  She's got a really good voting record, actually.
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:31.544]  She's probably top... She's top 10% of Republicans in Congress, as far as her voting record is concerned.
[01:03:31.904 --> 01:03:38.349]  And now I have to sit here, and I have to watch 20-nothing-year-old conservative influencers dump on her?
[01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:54.343]  And then I have to watch the same conservatives that have been in the media for decades and watched conservative values in politics and in culture go down the drain year after year after year and now those people are going to come after Lauren Boebert?
[01:03:54.743 --> 01:04:01.229]  The same people that have been in conservative politics for decades are now dumping on Boebert saying she's the problem?
[01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:02.430]  You're the problem!
[01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:10.632]  Twenty nothing year olds with barely any life experience dumping on Lauren Boebert saying she's the problem, you're the problem.
[01:04:13.173 --> 01:04:18.174]  Don't forget what the Democrats tried to do just to get Lauren Boebert out of office.
[01:04:18.534 --> 01:04:22.295]  They fought for months after the election was over to remove her.
[01:04:23.816 --> 01:04:30.557]  Then it turns out that this guy she's on a date with is a, he owns a gay bar and is a big Democrat.
[01:04:30.957 --> 01:04:32.578]  What if the whole thing was a setup?
[01:04:34.452 --> 01:04:36.614]  Now you're doing the Democrats' work for them?
[01:04:38.255 --> 01:04:41.497]  Now you have been tricked and duped by liberals!
[01:04:42.358 --> 01:04:44.579]  Conservatives getting tricked and duped by liberals.
[01:04:44.799 --> 01:04:45.199]  Wow!
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:46.480]  You must not be very bright.
[01:04:47.581 --> 01:04:50.683]  What if the whole thing was a setup to take Lauren Boebert out from the very beginning?
[01:04:52.865 --> 01:04:58.489]  Look, Lauren Boebert's private life, quite frankly, is none of my business to this extent.
[01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:05.402]  With her divorce and her kids and everything, but maybe she's vulnerable or maybe she's behaving like other divorced single mothers.
[01:05:06.463 --> 01:05:07.023]  Very common.
[01:05:09.945 --> 01:05:17.891]  And so maybe she did get set up and now you're gonna do the Democrats dirty work for them by trying to get her out and have her primaried?
[01:05:18.672 --> 01:05:24.256]  And probably cost Republicans another seat and one of our best, strongest, most consistent votes?
[01:05:25.417 --> 01:05:27.319]  And not bad for the culture either?
[01:05:28.857 --> 01:05:34.781]  Oh my gosh, oh she was vaping, oh she got groped out of the... You know what, maybe she made a mistake and maybe she can do better.
[01:05:35.021 --> 01:05:37.543]  But really, this is the hill to die on?
[01:05:38.983 --> 01:05:43.546]  And she's up there still voting for us the right way, again today, when most of the other Republicans will not?
[01:05:44.227 --> 01:05:46.788]  And it's the same people saying, this is what's wrong with Republicans!
[01:05:46.848 --> 01:05:47.329]  No, it's you.
[01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:55.754]  Alright, I'm gonna move on and cover some other news, including why the Democrats are in an absolute panic right now, and all their behavior shows that.
[01:05:56.294 --> 01:06:00.512]   But first, This special message from Alex Jones.

[01:08:57.709 --> 01:09:02.168]   about a gut-wrenching story here
[01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:08.049]  Man, our... The political persecution is out of control.
[01:09:11.190 --> 01:09:14.152]  The double standard for justice is criminal.
[01:09:16.213 --> 01:09:19.035]  A DC jury... DC jury...
[01:09:20.339 --> 01:09:24.243]  Just convicted two 70-plus-year-old pro-life activists, and a D.C.
[01:09:24.283 --> 01:09:26.765]  judge immediately ordered them into custody.
[01:09:29.027 --> 01:09:29.487]  My God.
[01:09:32.370 --> 01:09:33.191]  Announced by D.C.
[01:09:33.271 --> 01:09:33.471]  U.S.
[01:09:33.491 --> 01:09:38.235]  Attorney Matthew Graves, whose wife is a radical pro-abortion activist.
[01:09:38.255 --> 01:09:40.778]  Julie Kelly has the story here.
[01:09:44.693 --> 01:09:50.358]  Three defendants convicted of federal civil rights conspiracy and freedom of access to clinic entrances.
[01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:56.944]  Oh, the Justice Department is now concerned about civil rights and making sure you get access?
[01:09:58.405 --> 01:10:00.006]  Unless, of course, you're a Trump supporter.
[01:10:00.086 --> 01:10:02.649]  Then, you know, then your civil rights are criminal.
[01:10:04.571 --> 01:10:08.812]  For obstructing access to a reproductive health services facility because they're outside protesting.
[01:10:09.632 --> 01:10:12.033]  So let's take a look at these violent criminals.
[01:10:12.093 --> 01:10:12.733]  Look at that!
[01:10:12.793 --> 01:10:15.994]  Aren't you so glad these violent, raging criminals are off the streets?
[01:10:18.114 --> 01:10:21.295]  Are they like the Democrat attorneys that firebombed a police car?
[01:10:21.915 --> 01:10:27.737]  Are they like the Democrat George Floyd, Black Lives Matter, Antifa rioters that burnt entire cities to the ground?
[01:10:27.917 --> 01:10:32.438]  Billions in property damage, hundreds of hospitalizations, dozens of deaths.
[01:10:34.022 --> 01:10:35.963]  No, no, they're much worse.
[01:10:38.584 --> 01:10:42.326]  So they'll be taken into custody immediately.
[01:10:42.486 --> 01:10:46.087]  Two, I mean, these could be great grandmothers.
[01:10:47.528 --> 01:10:56.412]  If you're an audio audience member today, on the screen we have the 73 and 74 year old ladies.
[01:10:58.953 --> 01:11:03.135]  I mean, I just, this country is out of control.
[01:11:04.366 --> 01:11:13.095]  And I gotta tell you, because I am a firm believer that America is worth fighting for, freedom is worth fighting for, and that, I mean, I don't know where else you go, really.
[01:11:13.115 --> 01:11:29.522]   I mean, even if there are some countries that come up and might want to preserve freedom and independence for their people, like El Salvador, we'll see what happens with the most right-wing candidate Internationally right now, in Argentina.
[01:11:30.222 --> 01:11:35.904]  But it's just like, at this point, when people tell me, Owen, I gotta get out of this country.
[01:11:35.924 --> 01:11:37.224]  This is an authoritarian state.
[01:11:37.424 --> 01:11:40.624]  We have an out-of-control rogue government that's weaponized against the people.
[01:11:40.884 --> 01:11:49.406]  Yeah, when they're putting grannies in jail for being pro-life activists, you know, I get it.
[01:11:50.485 --> 01:11:54.485]  I'd say, I'd say, you know what, not my stance.
[01:11:54.485 --> 01:12:01.485]  I believe America is worth fighting for.
[01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:02.819]  But you know what?
[01:12:02.879 --> 01:12:10.083]  Yeah, this government is so criminal and out of control that they'll put grandmothers and they'll goose step them into the gulags right after their court date.
[01:12:10.523 --> 01:12:11.904]  Yeah, I get it.
[01:12:12.284 --> 01:12:12.624]  I get it.
[01:12:12.543 --> 01:12:15.104]   This is the most dangerous government on the planet now. I mean...
[01:12:15.104 --> 01:12:16.083]  Huh.
[01:12:16.083 --> 01:12:20.943]  What is this, Russia?
[01:12:21.151 --> 01:12:22.431]  I thought Russia was the bad guy.
[01:12:22.612 --> 01:12:27.594]  I thought Russia were the authoritarians that arrested grannies for free speech, speaking out against the government.
[01:12:27.614 --> 01:12:28.575]  I thought that was China!
[01:12:28.595 --> 01:12:29.395]  I thought that was Russia!
[01:12:29.575 --> 01:12:30.676]  I thought that was North Korea!
[01:12:30.936 --> 01:12:32.797]  No, that's the United States of America!
[01:12:35.458 --> 01:12:36.799]  That's the Democrats!
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:51.621]   So all the jokes, which weren't really jokes, but all the political references, To, oh, what is this, Russia?
[01:12:51.781 --> 01:12:53.221]  Oh, what is this, Communist China?
[01:12:53.361 --> 01:12:54.742]  Oh, what is this, North Korea?
[01:12:54.802 --> 01:12:56.222]  No, this is America!
[01:12:56.662 --> 01:13:05.745]  This is Democrat Party-run America, where grandmothers get goose-stepped into the gulag for being pro-life protesters!
[01:13:07.226 --> 01:13:07.606]  Gee!
[01:13:08.786 --> 01:13:09.647]  Gee, Grandma!
[01:13:10.805 --> 01:13:12.846]  I guess you made the wrong decision, Grandma.
[01:13:13.406 --> 01:13:20.449]  You should have been a liberal pro-choice activist and you should have burned down a Catholic church.
[01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:23.371]  Or you should have burned down a birthing center.
[01:13:24.251 --> 01:13:26.832]  Or you should have burned down a pro-life facility.
[01:13:27.072 --> 01:13:28.953]  Then you'd be released on the streets.
[01:13:29.694 --> 01:13:32.075]  Then the Democrats would do a fundraiser for you.
[01:13:32.835 --> 01:13:38.918]  But because these grandmas decided to protest for life and be a pro-life protester, they get goose-stepped into the gulag.
[01:13:41.007 --> 01:13:56.773]  And how sick, how sick do you have to be to be that individual that throws cuffs on a gray-haired granny and marches her into a jail cell?
[01:13:58.453 --> 01:13:59.353]  How sick?
[01:14:00.314 --> 01:14:03.355]  So I get it, you know, I gotta tell ya, I get it folks.
[01:14:04.858 --> 01:14:14.743]  I mean, if you haven't thought about your own survival instinct, and just having any semblance of freedom, which would mean for you to leave this country, I mean, I get it.
[01:14:15.363 --> 01:14:15.703]  I get it.
[01:14:15.743 --> 01:14:18.885]  When you see stories like that, I get it.
[01:14:19.085 --> 01:14:19.625]  Believe me.
[01:14:20.386 --> 01:14:20.826]  I get it.
[01:14:20.846 --> 01:14:26.108]  Alright, we got so much going on right now, it's hard to focus on anything.
[01:14:26.168 --> 01:14:33.112]  It's like a merry-go-round, except the lever is broken, and now it's at max speed.
[01:14:34.990 --> 01:15:19.214]   So you can try to jump off without breaking a leg, but it's hard to get focused on anything So let's talk about the panicked Democrats right now and Sometimes their media mouthpieces are the greatest indicator of what they're feeling on the inside Now I'll get into the news stories and the developments that that lead us here, but here's Nicole Wallace With MSNBC freaking out over the weekend at Trump's rise in popularity and just listen to the panic in her voice and her presentation here over the weekend discovering that Trump is popular and that their propaganda isn't working in clip 16.
[01:15:20.949 --> 01:15:27.035]  People say privately all the time and not on TV all very often, something really bad is gonna happen.
[01:15:27.535 --> 01:15:27.796]  Okay?
[01:15:28.096 --> 01:15:29.777]  Shit's about to hit the fan in this country.
[01:15:30.078 --> 01:15:37.484]  Fox News had to veer away from a lunatic spewing hatred and death threats for Democratic officials in New York because of the migrant caucus.
[01:15:38.105 --> 01:15:42.646]   Everyone is on, uh, I don't even know the word.
[01:15:43.066 --> 01:15:47.048]  Everyone knows that we're walking into something hideous and no one will do anything.
[01:15:47.348 --> 01:15:49.709]  I refuse to believe that nothing can be done.
[01:15:50.409 --> 01:15:57.571]  These are people getting their information in part because of the vacuum being created by people with, I don't even know if we call it a spine anymore.
[01:15:57.611 --> 01:15:59.292]  That might be an insult to spines.
[01:15:59.812 --> 01:16:03.593]  But there are still people out there with following people.
[01:16:04.013 --> 01:16:05.574]  Here's what I want to ask you.
[01:16:05.994 --> 01:16:10.196]  When something happens, what do you want to be able to tell your kids and grandkids you did?
[01:16:10.216 --> 01:16:11.116]  You're good with nothing?
[01:16:11.756 --> 01:16:14.117]  I didn't do anything because I didn't think anyone would.
[01:16:14.137 --> 01:16:15.418]  What are you calling for?
[01:16:15.498 --> 01:16:16.939]  Is that a call for violence?
[01:16:16.959 --> 01:16:18.219]  Because you did something.
[01:16:18.679 --> 01:16:19.700]  I tried to do something.
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.281]  Should she be criminally charged?
[01:16:22.301 --> 01:16:26.423]  I still have little slivers of a following in the cesspool that is the MAGA base.
[01:16:27.323 --> 01:16:28.144]  Oh, we're the cesspool.
[01:16:28.244 --> 01:16:29.424]  Okay, okay, that's good guys.
[01:16:29.464 --> 01:16:29.784]  That's good.
[01:16:30.145 --> 01:16:32.086]  We're the cesspool, not Washington DC.
[01:16:33.399 --> 01:16:35.360]  No, the American people are the cesspool.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.781]  Not the American media.
[01:16:37.221 --> 01:16:38.262]  The American people.
[01:16:39.002 --> 01:16:39.722]  Not Congress.
[01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:40.423]  Not politics.
[01:16:40.483 --> 01:16:41.704]  It's you, the people.
[01:16:44.145 --> 01:16:49.608]  But, let's give an analogy for what Nicole Wallace is so freaked out about.
[01:16:52.249 --> 01:16:56.071]  Imagine you're sitting at home on a Friday night with your family.
[01:16:58.453 --> 01:16:59.433]  Popcorn's fresh.
[01:17:00.294 --> 01:17:00.834]  Sit down.
[01:17:01.694 --> 01:17:02.575]  Movie's about to start.
[01:17:04.326 --> 01:17:06.767]  You and your family, just trying to enjoy a nice night in.
[01:17:08.428 --> 01:17:11.190]  And all of a sudden, somebody kicks in your door.
[01:17:13.151 --> 01:17:15.633]  And wants to rob you and is threatening you.
[01:17:17.994 --> 01:17:24.058]  And then... Somebody stands up, the man of the house, whatever, stands up, grabs their gun and says, Hey!
[01:17:25.099 --> 01:17:26.880]  You better get the hell out of here right now!
[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:32.323]  And then the thief and the criminal that broke into your house says, Hey, whoa!
[01:17:32.923 --> 01:17:33.764]  Whoa!
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.081]  Whoa!
[01:17:36.181 --> 01:17:37.941]  Things are about to hit the fan here!
[01:17:38.961 --> 01:17:39.222]  Yay!
[01:17:39.302 --> 01:17:39.562]  Whoa!
[01:17:39.622 --> 01:17:40.882]  Calm down!
[01:17:41.482 --> 01:17:43.863]  We don't want things getting out of hand here!
[01:17:46.224 --> 01:17:47.224]  What is going on?
[01:17:47.264 --> 01:17:48.325]  This is madness!
[01:17:48.545 --> 01:17:49.785]  This is insanity!
[01:17:50.045 --> 01:17:51.346]  You're out of control!
[01:17:52.086 --> 01:17:53.266]  What is wrong with you?
[01:17:53.286 --> 01:17:56.567]  Well of course that's insane!
[01:17:57.648 --> 01:17:58.548]  But that's what this is!
[01:18:00.933 --> 01:18:02.494]  That's exactly what this is.
[01:18:03.015 --> 01:18:10.242]  They have opened up our southern border and millions of people have come into this country at your expense.
[01:18:12.023 --> 01:18:14.005]  They have funded a war in Ukraine.
[01:18:14.986 --> 01:18:17.168]  The high estimate is hundreds of thousands have died.
[01:18:17.568 --> 01:18:20.351]  The low estimate is about 70-80 thousand have died.
[01:18:21.011 --> 01:18:22.453]  And that's on your dime.
[01:18:24.975 --> 01:18:26.136]  Gas prices are up.
[01:18:26.456 --> 01:18:27.497]  Inflation is up.
[01:18:27.837 --> 01:18:28.958]  Taxes is up.
[01:18:29.378 --> 01:18:30.259]  Energy bills is up.
[01:18:30.559 --> 01:18:31.580]  Grocery bills is up.
[01:18:34.582 --> 01:18:37.324]  And you're supposed to sit there and quietly take it.
[01:18:38.224 --> 01:18:42.047]  And because you're upset, Nicole Wallace has the issue with you.
[01:18:44.569 --> 01:18:46.010]  But no, that's exactly what this is.
[01:18:46.410 --> 01:18:49.793]  You're sitting at home on a Friday night trying to mind your own business with your family.
[01:18:50.928 --> 01:18:58.653]  A criminal breaks into your house and threatens to rob you, and you get up and protect your house and your family with a gun, and the criminal says, Hey!
[01:18:58.814 --> 01:18:59.814]  Whoa-ho-ho-ho!
[01:19:00.114 --> 01:19:01.936]  We don't need stuff to get out of hand here!
[01:19:01.996 --> 01:19:02.656]  Calm down!
[01:19:02.796 --> 01:19:03.857]  Sit back down!
[01:19:04.337 --> 01:19:07.019]  Sit down and calm down, or things are gonna get bad!
[01:19:09.981 --> 01:19:11.963]  Who's supposed to be in control of that situation?
[01:19:15.665 --> 01:19:18.928]  No, see, the Democrats are panicked.
[01:19:19.881 --> 01:19:23.002]  Because they know their propaganda isn't working.
[01:19:24.222 --> 01:19:27.624]  They know Americans are realizing what Bidenomics actually is.
[01:19:28.884 --> 01:19:56.467]   Higher gas prices, higher energy prices, higher grocery bills, higher taxes, total illegal immigration, all the money for Ukraine, no money for Hawaii, no money for East Palestine, a president that can't even do a press conference, and Biden's poll numbers are tanking, Trump's poll numbers are up, and up, and up, By the way, here's just a quick update from the Biden administration.
[01:19:57.948 --> 01:19:59.549]  Biden took a vacation this weekend.
[01:20:00.690 --> 01:20:02.511]  He went to his B's front mansion in Delaware.
[01:20:03.752 --> 01:20:08.857]  He has now spent 384 days of his presidency on vacation.
[01:20:08.897 --> 01:20:13.240]  That's 40% of his presidency on vacation.
[01:20:14.621 --> 01:20:15.302]  Must be nice.
[01:20:16.222 --> 01:20:16.963]  Must be nice.
[01:20:17.003 --> 01:20:20.146]  And Nicole Wallace says, sit down and shut up.
[01:20:21.209 --> 01:20:23.250]  What in the hell is wrong with you complaining about Joe Biden?
[01:20:23.370 --> 01:20:24.251]  You're the problem.
[01:20:26.172 --> 01:20:29.734]  A panicked Nicole Wallace says as her propaganda fails.
[01:20:31.175 --> 01:20:32.656]  Then he tried to go to dinner with his family.
[01:20:32.696 --> 01:20:33.457]  He couldn't even walk.
[01:20:33.937 --> 01:20:37.719]  Joe Biden needs help walking upstairs with his daughter Ashley.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:43.023]  I guess it's probably more appropriate than what we saw or heard about them doing in the shower.
[01:20:45.384 --> 01:20:49.507]  It's nice for Ashley to forgive Joe for the inappropriate behavior in the shower though, you have to say.
[01:20:52.924 --> 01:20:54.225]  And then there's Kamala Harris.
[01:20:55.266 --> 01:20:59.169]  Kamala Harris lectures on racist criminal justice system.
[01:20:59.189 --> 01:21:00.510]  Uh-huh.
[01:21:01.271 --> 01:21:02.231]  Which she knows all about.
[01:21:02.292 --> 01:21:02.972]  She was part of it.
[01:21:03.533 --> 01:21:09.958]  Because remember, she kept black men in prison past their release dates so that she could take advantage of the cheap state labor.
[01:21:11.314 --> 01:21:13.235]  So everybody knows Biden's a total fraud.
[01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:15.435]  Everybody knows Kamala Harris is a total fraud.
[01:21:15.935 --> 01:21:19.276]  The MSNBC Nicole Wallace propaganda machine is not working.
[01:21:19.896 --> 01:21:30.219]  And maybe that's why she's so concerned because maybe she's going to lose her cushy job that she doesn't deserve with that massive paycheck that she never earned because nobody buys her propaganda.
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:36.901]  Donald Trump leads Joe Biden nationally in the head-to-head presidential race.
[01:21:38.621 --> 01:21:44.763]  Almost every poll now is returning with Donald Trump beating Joe Biden head to head, just like it was before.
[01:21:46.003 --> 01:21:59.547]  And Reuters released a map of their polls statewide, or rather state by state, showing what would happen if the election was held tomorrow.
[01:21:59.587 --> 01:22:01.568]  Now here's what's funny about this.
[01:22:02.952 --> 01:22:08.076]  This is probably most likely... Uh-oh, I'm about to engage in criminal free speech.
[01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:09.457]  Don't tell the feds.
[01:22:11.119 --> 01:22:17.684]  This is most likely, more closely, a representation of how the 2020 presidential race actually finished.
[01:22:18.125 --> 01:22:19.005]  Right there on the screen.
[01:22:20.847 --> 01:22:36.775]   So... What's gonna happen when, for the next 420 or 330 odd days, All the national polling indicates that this is our electoral map heading into the 2024 election.
[01:22:38.891 --> 01:22:40.972]  And then what's going to happen on election night?
[01:22:41.393 --> 01:22:51.460]  Magically, Arizona will be blue, Nevada will be blue, Georgia will be blue, Wisconsin will be blue, Michigan will be blue, Pennsylvania will be blue.
[01:22:52.620 --> 01:23:05.209]  Even though every single poll and every single indicator has Trump winning those states, just like he was 95% of the time during the 2020 election, and then magically at 3.30 in the morning, it flipped blue.
[01:23:07.244 --> 01:23:09.104]  Because I'm going to tell you right now, that's what pace we're on.
[01:23:10.885 --> 01:23:24.509]  From where we stand right now, and keep in mind there's going to be a lot of changes that happen between now and the election, obviously, but I'm just telling you that the path that we're on right now is that this is going to be how all the polling indicates the 2024 election will go.
[01:23:26.195 --> 01:23:33.729]  And it'll go just like it did in 2020, and then those same five states will flip blue at 3 o'clock in the morning, just like they did in 2020.
[01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:38.578]  This is the path we're on, and so I guess we have to relive it for the American people to see again.
[01:23:39.591 --> 01:23:59.176]  This is a train headed north from Mexico to the United States, a train... I mean, if you're just, if you're an audience member today, audio audience member today, folks, we are reaching levels of insanity with this illegal immigration, the likes of which you can't even believe.
[01:24:00.276 --> 01:24:10.662]   We're talking about hundreds of train cars not filled with coal, Not filled with anything like that, not filled with any resources or goods or anything, but illegal immigrants.
[01:24:14.085 --> 01:24:29.455]  So, train loads, literal train loads of illegal immigrants coming across the border, and you really believe this continued resolution is going to stop the illegal immigration?
[01:24:29.595 --> 01:24:31.696]  Please, Byron Donalds, you're better than that.
[01:24:33.677 --> 01:24:34.458]  You're better than that.
[01:24:35.933 --> 01:24:53.003]  By the way, I have been chomping at the bit with the crew here to get a couple individuals that are covering the open southern border on the air, and they're so busy documenting the illegal immigration, there's not a moment to rest that we can't even get them on.
[01:24:54.083 --> 01:25:04.750]  They're like, yeah, I'd love to schedule a time to come on, but the illegal immigration issue is so insane and I've got to be available to document it at all times, so they just can't even commit to coming on the show.
[01:25:05.851 --> 01:25:13.053]  Because it's a 24-7 stream pipeline of illegal immigrants!
[01:25:15.814 --> 01:25:17.194]  Now it's by the trainload!
[01:25:18.674 --> 01:25:21.515]  You think that this is going to be... Oh, you think this is the only trainload?
[01:25:21.575 --> 01:25:22.615]  Let me tell you how this goes.
[01:25:23.416 --> 01:25:27.157]  Because Fox News got this footage, and I know how this goes.
[01:25:28.237 --> 01:25:47.905]   So this means that this was probably the second, third, fourth, maybe fifth trainload And whoever has access to that security camera at that train stop contacted somebody in the media and said, hey, I've got footage for you that nobody's seen.
[01:25:51.013 --> 01:25:56.157]  Of a literal trainload of illegal immigrants coming into the country.
[01:25:56.197 --> 01:25:56.757]  They say, what?
[01:25:56.838 --> 01:25:57.458]  A trainload?
[01:25:57.498 --> 01:25:58.479]  They say, yeah.
[01:25:58.839 --> 01:25:59.980]  Let me send you the footage.
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:01.301]  We've been watching it for months.
[01:26:01.321 --> 01:26:11.469]  It's kind of like, how do you think we got all that footage of the plane loads, the bus loads, the taxi cabs, and everything else that we got?
[01:26:12.089 --> 01:26:13.971]  We get contacted by whistleblowers.
[01:26:15.384 --> 01:26:22.328]  They tell us where to go, they tell us where the illegal immigrants are coming across, we go to the spots, we film it.
[01:26:22.988 --> 01:26:24.009]  That's how this works.
[01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:29.892]  So that is not the first train load, and I will bet you right now it won't be the last.
[01:26:30.433 --> 01:26:35.576]  Even if they pass this continued resolution, nobody's stopping this illegal immigration.
[01:26:37.810 --> 01:26:39.333]  Footage shows migrants cheering.
[01:26:39.433 --> 01:26:39.814]  Migrants.
[01:26:39.914 --> 01:26:40.735]  Illegal immigrants.
[01:26:40.755 --> 01:26:41.497]  Let's call them what they are.
[01:26:41.937 --> 01:26:43.039]  Illegal immigrants.
[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:46.005]  Because we have an immigration process in this country.
[01:26:48.910 --> 01:26:50.933]  So no, you are an illegal immigrant.
[01:26:52.452 --> 01:26:56.194]  Hell, I'm not even allowed to speak freely in my own country.
[01:26:56.534 --> 01:26:58.416]  I'm not even allowed to be anywhere near the U.S.
[01:26:58.456 --> 01:26:59.656]  Capitol in my own country.
[01:26:59.996 --> 01:27:10.563]  But you can hop on a train and come here illegally and get thousands, if not tens of thousands of dollars in value of free handouts from our government.
[01:27:14.745 --> 01:27:15.566]  Insanity.
[01:27:18.487 --> 01:27:32.487]   insanity so it's not the first train load it's not the last
[01:27:33.408 --> 01:27:42.771]  And you now have judges that are blocking fundraising groups from funding Border Patrol.
[01:27:43.531 --> 01:27:46.512]  Remember there was the group that tried to independently fund the wall.
[01:27:46.972 --> 01:27:49.953]  They got investigated, they got shut down by the IRS.
[01:27:54.525 --> 01:28:05.213]  And now you've got a judge in Brownsville who is blocking financial donations to law enforcement that are trying to stop the illegal immigrants from coming in.
[01:28:07.835 --> 01:28:22.825]  And so here he is giving a Border Patrol officer a hard time because he wants to accept these funds to try to do his job and stop the illegal immigrants, and a liberal judge makes sure that those funds get blocked, and here he is explaining it in clip 12.
[01:28:24.393 --> 01:28:26.515]  This appeared to be a political event.
[01:28:26.855 --> 01:28:28.217]  Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[01:28:28.237 --> 01:28:28.477]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:28.557 --> 01:28:33.221]  But I'm very curious why you were the only one selected or given an opportunity to fund it.
[01:28:33.321 --> 01:28:35.343]  So pause it real quick for a little more context here.
[01:28:36.164 --> 01:28:39.026]  He says, oh, it's political.
[01:28:40.628 --> 01:28:51.037]  It's political to take fundraising efforts from private citizens to support Border Patrol.
[01:28:52.802 --> 01:29:10.035]  So, okay, if I go down to Brownsville, Texas right now, and I go to one of these hot border areas, and there's 30 Border Patrol agents around, and I decide to have a barbecue, and I say, hey, I want to support Border Patrol.
[01:29:10.256 --> 01:29:11.376]  I'm going to have a barbecue.
[01:29:11.697 --> 01:29:13.538]  You guys like brisket?
[01:29:13.558 --> 01:29:15.019]  You guys like pulled pork sandwiches?
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:16.540]  We're going to have a barbecue here.
[01:29:16.981 --> 01:29:17.381]  And then what?
[01:29:17.421 --> 01:29:19.563]  A liberal judge is going to say, that's political.
[01:29:20.862 --> 01:29:21.803]  Well, what is he really saying?
[01:29:21.903 --> 01:29:25.205]  Folks, he's telling you the whole story.
[01:29:25.585 --> 01:29:29.728]  That only conservatives and Republicans support stopping illegal immigration.
[01:29:30.109 --> 01:29:42.838]  And any action taken or any support to try to stop the illegal immigration is considered a Republican Party activity and therefore judges rule that it must be shut down.
[01:29:44.659 --> 01:29:45.320]  So think about that.
[01:29:47.108 --> 01:29:50.691]  Wanting to have a border is now considered Republican Party politics.
[01:29:50.891 --> 01:29:52.412]  So in other words, what's the opposition?
[01:29:52.692 --> 01:29:55.174]  Democrat Party politics want an open border.
[01:29:55.414 --> 01:29:55.775]  Continue.
[01:29:57.755 --> 01:30:00.056]  This appeared to be a political event.
[01:30:00.196 --> 01:30:01.556]  Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[01:30:01.576 --> 01:30:01.897]  Yes, sir.
[01:30:01.937 --> 01:30:10.240]  But I'm very curious why you were the only one selected or given an opportunity to fund it or to support it and you don't want to share any of the money with any of the other constables.
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:12.100]  Because he's a border town.
[01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:14.181]  We didn't contact anybody about this.
[01:30:14.501 --> 01:30:16.202]  They contacted our department.
[01:30:16.342 --> 01:30:16.822]  Who's they?
[01:30:17.222 --> 01:30:18.262]  We fund the Blue Foundation.
[01:30:18.282 --> 01:30:18.883]  Where are they from?
[01:30:19.103 --> 01:30:19.723]  They're from Florida.
[01:30:20.143 --> 01:30:20.543]  Florida?
[01:30:20.663 --> 01:30:20.963]  Yes, sir.
[01:30:21.003 --> 01:30:29.046]  They contacted me, so what they do... Do they support giving money to democratically elected, to Democrats that are elected law enforcement?
[01:30:29.086 --> 01:30:30.046]  Or just Republicans?
[01:30:30.247 --> 01:30:31.527]  The previous two, they did.
[01:30:31.547 --> 01:30:32.167]  Yeah, they were Democrats.
[01:30:32.187 --> 01:30:35.348]  Between sheriffs, which was in Del Rio and El Paso.
[01:30:35.428 --> 01:30:35.548]  Oh.
[01:30:35.568 --> 01:30:36.609]  Sorry, liberal judge, wrong.
[01:30:36.769 --> 01:30:39.530]  Are they donating money to the sheriff's department here?
[01:30:40.387 --> 01:30:41.747]  They, like I said, they did not choose.
[01:30:41.787 --> 01:30:42.808]  They chose my department.
[01:30:42.928 --> 01:30:43.728]  I got contacted.
[01:30:43.748 --> 01:30:44.648]  Because he's in a border town.
[01:30:44.668 --> 01:30:46.469]  I can help out with this event.
[01:30:47.849 --> 01:30:52.671]  But yeah, as far as it being politically directed, on my part it was not.
[01:30:52.771 --> 01:30:56.852]  In the flyer it said that they were going to clean up the mess that the Biden administration had left.
[01:30:57.052 --> 01:30:58.612]  That was part of the announcement.
[01:30:59.133 --> 01:31:00.593]  I did not see that on the flyer, sir.
[01:31:00.673 --> 01:31:01.213]  You didn't see that?
[01:31:01.373 --> 01:31:03.494]  No sir, I didn't say that on the flyer about the Biden administration.
[01:31:05.713 --> 01:31:16.377]  I think this is a political event, Constable, and to put it under the guise of helping out or cleaning up without getting other parties involved, it's very concerning to me.
[01:31:16.797 --> 01:31:17.018]  Yes, sir.
[01:31:17.038 --> 01:31:20.879]  This is unreal.
[01:31:20.899 --> 01:31:22.080]  By the way, nobody's covering this.
[01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:25.421]  The only news outlet that's covered this is the Post Millennial.
[01:31:25.861 --> 01:31:28.102]  So if you try to find any news on this, you can't.
[01:31:29.582 --> 01:31:37.528]  Guys, see if you can pull it up before the break on the post-millennial, if you just search, like, uh, back the blue or whatever it's called, fund the blue, or, I forget what he said there.
[01:31:37.768 --> 01:31:39.189]  Post-millennial, only place covering it.
[01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:52.899]  So, so, the liberal judge thinks he catches the Sheriff's Department by saying, well, this group only funds Republicans, and he says, nope, they funded the last two sheriffs, they were both Democrats.
[01:31:53.519 --> 01:31:53.719]  Oops!
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:55.520]  Oops!
[01:31:56.821 --> 01:31:57.102]  There it is.
[01:31:58.166 --> 01:31:58.686]  Good job, guys.
[01:31:59.547 --> 01:32:06.329]  Democrat judge blocks $15,000 donation to Texas border town law enforcement as Biden border crisis rages on.
[01:32:06.349 --> 01:32:08.350]  He says, well, why do they only give the money to you?
[01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:10.671]  Because it's a border town.
[01:32:12.032 --> 01:32:13.972]  It's for border security.
[01:32:14.493 --> 01:32:20.375]  So if I had a border security fund, am I going to give that to Iowa?
[01:32:24.717 --> 01:32:26.077]  They're so disingenuous.
[01:32:26.517 --> 01:32:27.598]  They're such liars.
[01:32:29.417 --> 01:32:32.979]  Why didn't you share that Border Patrol fund with Iowa?
[01:32:33.139 --> 01:32:36.381]  Now, I'm reaching because this is obviously Texas, but that'd be like, oh, okay.
[01:32:36.581 --> 01:32:39.623]  Why didn't you share that Border Patrol fund with Dallas?
[01:32:41.143 --> 01:32:43.365]  Because Dallas isn't a border area?
[01:32:45.926 --> 01:32:48.207]  Why didn't you give that money to Travis County?
[01:32:48.387 --> 01:32:50.028]  Because Travis County isn't at the border?
[01:32:51.869 --> 01:32:53.130]  So we fund the blue.
[01:32:53.150 --> 01:32:55.051]  $15,000, folks!
[01:32:58.174 --> 01:33:03.956]  I'm not, I mean, again, like, hey, that's a great effort and those groups doing that, good for them.
[01:33:04.736 --> 01:33:08.217]  But $15,000 is barely anything.
[01:33:08.557 --> 01:33:10.977]  And by the way, I know some of the groups there that help fund that.
[01:33:11.558 --> 01:33:15.319]  Water filter groups, gun rights groups.
[01:33:15.819 --> 01:33:18.239]  $15,000 is kind of just like a pat on the back.
[01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:20.000]  Again, that's great!
[01:33:22.121 --> 01:33:30.145]   Democrat judges won't even allow you to walk up to a Border Patrol agent and just give them a little A little pat on the back.
[01:33:30.405 --> 01:33:35.408]  Again, if I go down and I say, hey, I'm going to have a barbecue for Border Patrol agents, are they going to shut that down too?
[01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:36.970]  Say, you need to do that for Texas.
[01:33:37.410 --> 01:33:40.012]  You need to do that for Dallas and Austin and everywhere else too.
[01:33:40.212 --> 01:33:41.052]  Well, it's a border fund.
[01:33:41.112 --> 01:33:41.713]  I don't care.
[01:33:41.533 --> 01:33:48.533]   I mean, Democrats at every level are doing everything they can to destroy this country.
[01:33:48.533 --> 01:34:04.533]  [Music]

[01:34:34.696 --> 01:34:35.957]  I've been called a liar.
[01:34:36.717 --> 01:34:40.138]  I've been silenced on virtually every platform created by man.
[01:34:40.838 --> 01:34:43.138]  My life has been threatened, repeatedly.
[01:34:43.758 --> 01:34:46.319]  They've tried to destroy me, but I've survived.
[01:34:47.479 --> 01:34:49.900]  And that's why I'm joining Mug Club.
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:53.941]  The re-platforming begins now!
[01:34:54.161 --> 01:35:11.528]   Join Mug Club and get one month free with promo code ALEX at jonescrowder.com In case you haven't noticed, the Democrats are completely emboldened because Republicans have no spine, no backbone, no courage, no tenacity.
[01:35:12.029 --> 01:35:14.791]  So Democrat judges will now block funding.
[01:35:15.552 --> 01:35:20.596]  They will block funding, private funding, to Border Patrol groups.
[01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:29.224]  And they sit up there and they just say, well, you can't do this.
[01:35:31.522 --> 01:35:32.982]  Because they only give it to Republicans.
[01:35:33.723 --> 01:35:41.464]  And the Sheriff's Department representative says, no, actually, the last two sheriffs were Democrats.
[01:35:43.065 --> 01:35:46.185]  And then he says, well, yo, gotcha there, liberal.
[01:35:46.986 --> 01:35:50.607]  Well, but they said it was to stop Biden's border disaster.
[01:35:51.727 --> 01:35:54.467]  Well, what do you call six million illegal immigrants since Biden took office?
[01:35:54.487 --> 01:35:56.768]  I mean, Biden's the president.
[01:35:59.128 --> 01:36:00.889]  They did it when Trump was president too.
[01:36:00.889 --> 01:36:14.568]   I mean, you got, they're throwing grandmothers in jail for being pro-life activists.
[01:36:14.568 --> 01:36:24.568]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:36:18.672 --> 01:36:24.136]  They're throwing 73- and 74-year-old grandmothers in jail for being a pro-life activist.
[01:36:25.757 --> 01:36:29.037]  I'll go ahead and get ahead of another story right now.
[01:36:29.037 --> 01:36:41.877]   And in fact, let me just preface it by saying this.
[01:36:41.877 --> 01:36:51.877]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:36:43.110 --> 01:36:51.437]  The Department of Justice and the federal government is watching me and my lawyer even more intently now than they ever have before.
[01:36:51.457 --> 01:36:52.338]  Okay.
[01:36:53.419 --> 01:36:54.299]  I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[01:36:56.641 --> 01:36:57.522]  I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[01:37:00.405 --> 01:37:04.168]  Folks, it's worse than just me being sentenced to jail for my free speech.
[01:37:07.841 --> 01:37:08.822]  I'm going to leave it at that for now.
[01:37:10.762 --> 01:37:17.762]  But I'll go ahead and get ahead of another story.
[01:37:17.762 --> 01:37:20.762]  There's going to be another case very soon.
[01:37:20.762 --> 01:37:24.762]  This story's going to break in January.
[01:37:24.762 --> 01:37:34.762]   Where individuals who were filming, filming on January 6th, are now going to start going to jail.
[01:37:34.762 --> 01:37:41.762]  Okay.
[01:37:42.598 --> 01:37:49.944]  And you're going to see things in the next year that you can't even believe.
[01:37:51.985 --> 01:38:05.575]  You're going to see levels of corruption from the Democrat Party and the Biden Justice Department that are even going to make my case look like nothing.
[01:38:07.216 --> 01:38:08.457]  My case is the test case.
[01:38:11.752 --> 01:38:14.153]  I'm going to tell you that right now.
[01:38:14.173 --> 01:38:15.334]  My case is the test case.
[01:38:19.135 --> 01:38:28.340]  And the Department of Justice, if they can arrest Owen Schroer for his speech, then they have thousands of arrests following.
[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:30.221]  I'm just going to tell you.
[01:38:33.782 --> 01:38:34.923]  I don't want to get too out ahead of this.
[01:38:36.854 --> 01:38:38.035]  We've got a legal strategy.
[01:38:38.755 --> 01:38:39.656]  We've said our piece.
[01:38:40.316 --> 01:38:41.557]  The legal fight is ongoing.
[01:38:41.757 --> 01:38:52.284]  I can't thank the audience enough for supporting it at DefendOwen.com, but I'm just telling you right now, they were watching me heavily before.
[01:38:52.584 --> 01:38:56.566]  Now it's like 10 times, and it's everything my lawyer is doing.
[01:38:59.148 --> 01:39:02.950]  And it's my case that is the test case that's the first domino to fall.
[01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.711]  I'm gonna tell you right now.
[01:39:05.871 --> 01:39:21.541]  So if Owen Schroer gets incarcerated and this unbelievable overreach by the federal government and Department of Justice for my speech, if they're successful with that, thousands of other individuals and journalists are going to be arrested next.
[01:39:21.561 --> 01:39:23.022]  Okay?
[01:39:24.497 --> 01:39:26.118]  That's what's going on.
[01:39:26.138 --> 01:39:31.782]  I mean, you think it's just one liberal judge trying to block $15,000 from getting to Border Patrol?
[01:39:32.182 --> 01:39:38.966]  Folks, these Democrats on every level of this government are just berserking to try to destroy our country.
[01:39:39.826 --> 01:39:41.808]  Support for Trump stronger than ever.
[01:39:41.828 --> 01:39:46.290]  300 plus car motorcade spotted on Long Island in New York.
[01:39:48.372 --> 01:39:50.013]  Yeah, show me a Biden motorcade.
[01:39:50.053 --> 01:39:51.314]  Show me a Biden boat parade.
[01:39:51.354 --> 01:39:52.274]  Show me a Biden hat.
[01:39:52.314 --> 01:39:53.355]  Show me a Biden rally.
[01:39:55.455 --> 01:39:56.276]  There are none.
[01:39:57.297 --> 01:39:58.979]  But he has the most votes of all time.
[01:39:59.479 --> 01:39:59.920]  Duh!
[01:40:01.902 --> 01:40:02.322]  Stupid.
[01:40:04.965 --> 01:40:16.577]  That's like, uh... It's like if... Let's say, uh... Mike Trout, Major League Baseball player...
[01:40:18.584 --> 01:40:21.345]  Mike Trout has the most home runs in Major League history.
[01:40:21.885 --> 01:40:22.425]  You say, really?
[01:40:22.665 --> 01:40:23.565]  Well, show me the home runs.
[01:40:23.585 --> 01:40:26.366]  Well, he doesn't have the most home runs in Major League history.
[01:40:26.606 --> 01:40:29.147]  They just said he did and he just has the numbers on a sheet somehow.
[01:40:32.668 --> 01:40:33.508]  So it's insanity.
[01:40:37.169 --> 01:40:38.049]  Maybe I'll get into this.
[01:40:38.129 --> 01:40:39.390]  No, no, let me just get into this now.
[01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:58.122]   Let me just get into this now because From all the election coverage that I've done here at InfoWars, the 2016 presidential, the 2018 midterms, the 2020 presidential, the 2022 midterms, and now we're heading into the 2024 presidential, I've learned a lot.
[01:40:59.522 --> 01:41:15.861]   And I will tell you, research, when it comes to data and analytics and statistics, Has always been a strong field of mine, because when you come up in sports media and as a sports writer, that's a major thrust of your work.
[01:41:17.022 --> 01:41:20.825]  So I've always been good at that, and that translated well to elections.
[01:41:22.466 --> 01:41:34.256]  And so there was a major trend that, if you follow my coverage, you knew about this, but you don't even have to follow my coverage, this is all publicly available data.
[01:41:35.506 --> 01:41:36.426]  When it comes to elections.
[01:41:36.526 --> 01:41:39.827]  And now others are starting to pick up on it.
[01:41:41.808 --> 01:41:43.708]  What is the analogy that I've always made?
[01:41:47.409 --> 01:41:57.712]  The Biden 2020 election victory is like nobody in Major League Baseball hit 60 home runs for 60 years and now all of a sudden multiple players are doing it.
[01:41:58.832 --> 01:42:00.373]  Well, something wasn't organic.
[01:42:00.913 --> 01:42:01.833]  It was steroids.
[01:42:03.689 --> 01:42:06.791]  So you find out those numbers were inflated by steroids.
[01:42:07.832 --> 01:42:11.834]  But now the same thing happens with votes!
[01:42:14.676 --> 01:42:19.559]  So Carrie Lake's people are analyzing this and they're using it as part of their appeal in her lawsuit.
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:32.109]   Did you know, this is Tyler Boyer reporting, Did you know the Arizona population only increased about 9% from 2014 to 2022?
[01:42:32.769 --> 01:42:37.670]  But its voter participation in the same time period increased over 70%!
[01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:44.912]  Carrie Lake received more than 50% increased votes than Doug Ducey's first election.
[01:42:45.252 --> 01:42:47.812]  Hobbs received twice as many as Duvall.
[01:42:49.073 --> 01:42:50.253]  The left's game.
[01:42:50.353 --> 01:42:53.014]  Now again folks, this is all publicly available data.
[01:42:53.094 --> 01:43:05.035]   Looks like they're pulling this This looks like Wikipedia pages here, but Wikipedia does have good election data, but this stuff is verifiable everywhere, and it's, I mean, 99.8% of the time it all lines up.
[01:43:06.056 --> 01:43:10.237]  You might find different numbers depending on what sites you go to, but it's overall usually the same picture.
[01:43:11.738 --> 01:43:13.218]  So let me explain this phenomenon.
[01:43:14.919 --> 01:43:22.062]  What happened, 2020 is the best example of this because it's the most obvious.
[01:43:23.349 --> 01:43:32.573]  2020 is the 1998 Major League Baseball season, where nobody hit 60 home runs for 60 years, and now multiple players are hitting 60-plus home runs.
[01:43:36.455 --> 01:43:50.141]  Losers, typically Republicans, losers, like Donald Trump, in the 2020 election, set records for getting the most votes of all time.
[01:43:52.549 --> 01:43:54.810]  Yeah, it wasn't just Donald Trump.
[01:43:55.451 --> 01:44:10.980]  It was all across the country that the losers in dozens, if not hundreds of major political races, losers were setting records for the most votes of all time.
[01:44:15.143 --> 01:44:17.064]  Now you tell me how that's possible.
[01:44:21.986 --> 01:44:22.606]  You tell me.
[01:44:25.907 --> 01:44:27.988]  But see, it was the same thing with steroids in baseball.
[01:44:29.549 --> 01:44:32.029]  Sammy Sosa hit 66 home runs in 1998.
[01:44:32.410 --> 01:44:36.731]  It was more home runs than anybody of all time, but he was still the loser in the home run chase.
[01:44:39.232 --> 01:44:39.972]  But it was the same thing.
[01:44:40.512 --> 01:44:42.933]  Everybody knew it wasn't natural.
[01:44:43.893 --> 01:44:48.335]  Everybody knew steroids were in baseball.
[01:44:50.131 --> 01:44:54.853]  But we just ignored it for the time being and then years later made a big fuss of it and called it corruption.
[01:44:54.993 --> 01:44:56.134]  But everybody knew it at the time.
[01:44:57.474 --> 01:45:00.596]  It's the same thing happening with our elections.
[01:45:03.097 --> 01:45:17.083]  Any honest evaluator of this data, auditor, forensics auditor, data analysis, anybody looking at this would obviously see this and say there is a giant anomaly here, something is not natural.
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:25.821]  It's not just Kerry Lake losing the governor's race in Arizona with a record number of votes.
[01:45:26.261 --> 01:45:30.622]  It's not just Donald Trump losing the presidency with a record number of votes.
[01:45:30.962 --> 01:45:34.983]  This happened across the entire country.
[01:45:36.864 --> 01:45:43.864]  Now you tell me how that happens.
[01:45:43.864 --> 01:45:54.819]   Folks, in some of these areas we're talking about 40, 50% increase in voter turnout.
[01:45:57.581 --> 01:46:00.382]  We're talking obscene numbers here.
[01:46:01.482 --> 01:46:02.743]  Impossible, even.
[01:46:04.763 --> 01:46:15.648]  But my speech is criminalized by the Justice Department because I doubt that those results are fair.
[01:46:17.128 --> 01:46:27.090]   I doubt that those results represented what actually happened?
[01:46:27.090 --> 01:46:27.590]  Come on.
[01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:37.590]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:46:29.618 --> 01:46:30.038]  Come on.
[01:46:32.621 --> 01:46:34.802]  Do we really have to play this game?
[01:46:36.224 --> 01:46:41.188]  Do we really have to pretend like Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds are not using steroids?
[01:46:44.755 --> 01:46:55.240]  Do we really have to pretend that hundreds of races across the country in 2020 and 2022, the losers got record voter turnout?
[01:46:57.941 --> 01:47:04.585]  Are you really going to argue me that Joe Biden got 15 million more votes than Barack Obama?
[01:47:05.845 --> 01:47:06.165]  Really?
[01:47:07.946 --> 01:47:08.507]  You believe that?
[01:47:11.128 --> 01:47:13.309]  And so you see, that's, that's the frustration here.
[01:47:15.506 --> 01:47:24.748]  When I have the Justice Department, which is corrupt, but then the attorneys that get put on these cases that probably are not corrupt people, they're just doing their job.
[01:47:27.029 --> 01:47:28.889]  But they're the ones that are going to criminally charge me.
[01:47:28.969 --> 01:47:32.210]  They're the ones that are going to write sentencing memos, criminalizing my free speech.
[01:47:34.330 --> 01:47:37.791]  And I just sit here and I say, really?
[01:47:40.822 --> 01:47:43.723]  You believe Joe Biden got 15 million more votes than Barack Obama?
[01:47:43.743 --> 01:47:44.663]  Show me a Biden rally.
[01:47:44.843 --> 01:47:45.704]  Show me a Biden hat.
[01:47:45.924 --> 01:47:47.084]  Show me a Biden boat parade.
[01:47:47.304 --> 01:47:49.225]  Show me a Biden car caravan.
[01:47:52.786 --> 01:47:53.046]  Really?
[01:47:53.986 --> 01:47:55.747]  I'm not allowed to question an election?
[01:47:55.867 --> 01:48:01.088]  I'm not allowed to question whether Mark McGuire, Barry Bonds, and Sammy Sosa use steroids?
[01:48:01.388 --> 01:48:05.830]  I'm not allowed to question Barry Bonds, whose head grew five sizes?
[01:48:07.810 --> 01:48:09.051]  Looks like a damn bobblehead?
[01:48:10.325 --> 01:48:11.445]  I'm not allowed to question that?
[01:48:12.226 --> 01:48:13.686]  I mean, are you serious?
[01:48:15.726 --> 01:48:18.827]  And so it's beyond just criminalizing my free speech.
[01:48:18.947 --> 01:48:26.249]  It's that you're criminalizing speech about an issue that you clearly have no idea about.
[01:48:26.649 --> 01:48:30.791]  That you clearly have not investigated for yourself because this is your country too!
[01:48:32.711 --> 01:48:33.791]  This is your country too!
[01:48:34.131 --> 01:48:35.792]  This is where your kids are gonna have to grow up too!
[01:48:37.889 --> 01:48:42.693]  But I'm not allowed to question how Joe Biden gets 15 million more votes than Barack Obama.
[01:48:42.773 --> 01:48:47.176]  I'm not allowed to question how hundreds of losers have record-setting voter turnout.
[01:48:47.236 --> 01:48:48.017]  I'm not allowed to question that.
[01:48:50.198 --> 01:48:52.159]  Barry Bonds never used steroids.
[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:54.441]  His hat didn't grow ten sizes.
[01:48:55.722 --> 01:48:59.184]  And Joe Biden got 15 million more votes than Barack Obama.
[01:48:59.365 --> 01:49:02.507]  And Donald Trump, who got a record number of votes, lost the election to Joe Biden.
[01:49:02.527 --> 01:49:03.487]  That's all very real.
[01:49:04.328 --> 01:49:11.900]   And Democrats have never stoked Or tried to incite violence with their rhetoric ever.
[01:49:12.761 --> 01:49:22.390]  And so this video here in clip 11 is completely meaningless, doesn't prove any of that, and certainly doesn't show the double standard applied in the justice system here in clip 11.
[01:49:24.121 --> 01:49:27.944]  I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all over the country, and maybe there will be.
[01:49:28.544 --> 01:49:30.606]  People need to start taking to the streets.
[01:49:30.666 --> 01:49:32.227]  This is a detainer.
[01:49:32.467 --> 01:49:36.110]  You know, there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there is unrest in our lives.
[01:49:36.571 --> 01:49:37.972]  Enemies of the state.
[01:49:38.392 --> 01:49:41.955]  Show me where it says that protests are supposed to be polite and peaceful.
[01:49:42.628 --> 01:49:46.191]  Do something about your dad's immigration practices, you feckless.
[01:49:46.371 --> 01:49:47.712]  They go low, we kick them.
[01:49:47.972 --> 01:49:50.874]  How do you resist the temptation to run up and wring her neck?
[01:49:50.954 --> 01:49:57.879]  The biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right.
[01:49:58.059 --> 01:49:59.380]  I thought he should have punched him in the face.
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:01.462]  I said, even if you lost, he insulted your wife.
[01:50:01.482 --> 01:50:03.984]  He came down the escalator and called Mexicans rapists and murderers.
[01:50:04.024 --> 01:50:05.145]  He said, well, what do you think I should have done?
[01:50:05.165 --> 01:50:07.346]  I said, I think you should have punched him in the face and then gotten out of the race.
[01:50:07.366 --> 01:50:08.027]  You would have been a hero.
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:10.101]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[01:50:10.561 --> 01:50:14.043]  I said if we were in high school I'd take you behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.
[01:50:14.063 --> 01:50:16.324]  PUNCH SOME PEOPLE IN THE FACE!
[01:50:16.484 --> 01:50:19.825]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[01:50:20.085 --> 01:50:22.446]  They're still gonna have to go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump.
[01:50:22.587 --> 01:50:23.187]  And that's a fact.
[01:50:26.491 --> 01:50:28.852]  Look as his character is stabbed to death.
[01:50:29.492 --> 01:50:32.273]  Where is John Wilkes Booth when you need him?
[01:50:32.733 --> 01:50:37.394]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[01:50:38.134 --> 01:50:45.596]  A Missouri State Senator is under investigation by the Secret Service after saying she hopes President Trump is assassinated.
[01:50:45.976 --> 01:50:48.517]  I will go and take Trump out tonight.
[01:50:48.617 --> 01:50:57.479]   And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant in a department store, at a gasoline station.
[01:50:57.479 --> 01:51:00.719]  You get out and you create a crowd.
[01:51:00.719 --> 01:51:02.838]  And you push back on them.
[01:51:02.838 --> 01:51:07.759]  And you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.
[01:51:07.759 --> 01:51:14.399]   -And sadly, the domestic enemies to our voting system and our honoring our Constitution
[01:51:14.399 --> 01:51:17.399]  are right at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
[01:51:17.356 --> 01:51:21.778]  They're not going to stop before Election Day in November and they're not going to stop after Election Day.
[01:51:22.258 --> 01:51:28.161]   And that should be everyone should take note of that on both levels that They're not going to let up, and they should not.
[01:51:28.521 --> 01:51:31.961]  If you think we're rallying now, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:51:31.961 --> 01:51:33.400]  [SIREN]
[01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:35.360]  [GUNSHOTS]
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:35.921]  That's right.
[01:51:35.921 --> 01:51:40.582]   And then we saw, of course, the riots take place all across the United States of America, billions of
[01:51:40.582 --> 01:51:43.280]   dollars of property damage, multiple murders,
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:47.162]  hundreds of police officers and citizens hospitalized.
[01:51:47.162 --> 01:51:54.641]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:51:53.501 --> 01:51:53.881]  Why?
[01:51:54.422 --> 01:51:55.462]  Why do you lie to yourselves?
[01:51:55.522 --> 01:51:56.483]  Why do you lie to the people?
[01:51:57.283 --> 01:51:58.464]  Just come out and be honest.
[01:51:58.944 --> 01:52:01.006]  Democrats are allowed to do whatever the hell they want.
[01:52:02.586 --> 01:52:04.648]  Republicans, everything you do is criminalized.
[01:52:06.349 --> 01:52:08.750]  If you were honest about it, I'd have a little more respect for you.
[01:52:09.351 --> 01:52:15.814]  So I think Merrick Garland should release a statement saying, yes, Democrats are allowed to riot, Republicans are not.
[01:52:17.075 --> 01:52:19.797]  And of course, that's not even fair because Republicans don't riot.
[01:52:22.247 --> 01:52:25.809]  We'll even let them lie a little bit in their statements, because they can't be fully honest.
[01:52:25.869 --> 01:52:27.890]  It's impossible for a Democrat to be fully honest.
[01:52:29.832 --> 01:52:42.699]  So no, Merrick Garland should come out and say, liberals, Democrats, progressives, we're allowed to do violence and riots and deny elections and we can do whatever the hell they want, but our opposition, if they do it, they will be criminalized.
[01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:44.360]  Just come out and say it!
[01:52:45.201 --> 01:52:47.882]  Just be honest about the state of things in this country.
[01:52:47.903 --> 01:52:49.063]  Stop lying to us.
[01:52:48.922 --> 01:52:55.322]  we know the truth.
[01:52:55.322 --> 01:52:59.122]   If Democrats call for violence because Trump is president, that's legal.
[01:52:59.149 --> 01:53:03.913]  If Owen Schroer and Alex Jones try to stop people from committing violent acts, that's criminal!
[01:53:05.174 --> 01:53:05.635]  Okay?
[01:53:05.715 --> 01:53:07.136]  That's the country we're in.
[01:53:07.176 --> 01:53:08.717]  That's Democrat Party rule.
[01:53:08.777 --> 01:53:09.498]  Just say it.
[01:53:09.558 --> 01:53:10.679]  Just be honest.
[01:53:12.201 --> 01:53:21.870]   And I'm sure that the Biden administration denying Secret Service protection for RFK Jr.
[01:53:21.930 --> 01:53:29.013]  wasn't strategic, and now it looked like maybe somebody tried to make an attempt on his life.
[01:53:29.614 --> 01:53:37.018]  An armed man with loaded guns arrested impersonating RFK's security team during an event in California.
[01:53:37.978 --> 01:53:40.860]  He was impersonating a security officer.
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:46.203]  RFK's security team was on the ball and said, hey, this guy's not with us, so let's investigate him.
[01:53:46.243 --> 01:53:48.224]  They detained him and then he was arrested.
[01:53:50.742 --> 01:53:59.486]  For impersonating an officer and falsely claiming to be a member of Kennedy's security team when he wasn't.
[01:54:03.647 --> 01:54:09.090]  By the way, there was a powerful C-SPAN segment with RFK Jr.
[01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:09.970]  and a caller.
[01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:12.431]  I'm going to be covering that later on The War Room.
[01:54:14.329 --> 01:54:15.410]  But so, so there you go.
[01:54:16.190 --> 01:54:21.653]  So Democrats can call for violence and engage in violence and that's all perfectly fine.
[01:54:22.073 --> 01:54:26.235]  But if a conservative calls for peace, that's inciting a riot and you're going to jail.
[01:54:26.515 --> 01:54:28.216]  That's how they operate.
[01:54:30.697 --> 01:54:33.038]  Alright, and it couldn't be more obvious really at this point.
[01:54:33.098 --> 01:54:38.381]  Alright, let's go quickly here before we get into the latest news with this continued resolution vote.
[01:54:38.801 --> 01:54:42.801]  Let's go to a special message from Alex Jones.
[01:54:42.801 --> 01:54:47.801]  [Music]

[01:54:53.759 --> 01:55:01.983]  But our three best selling products over the years are not always available because they're so hard to source and get the actual super high quality ingredients.
[01:55:02.723 --> 01:55:06.065]  But after more than two years, we finally have all three of these great products.

[01:55:52.110 --> 01:55:52.930]  Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:55:53.050 --> 01:55:55.351]  Then we have Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:55:55.611 --> 01:55:57.351]  The strongest turmeric on the market.
[01:55:58.732 --> 01:56:00.672]  95% curcuminoid.
[01:56:01.232 --> 01:56:02.593]  The average competitor is 5%.
[01:56:02.653 --> 01:56:03.993]  You still get a great response.
[01:56:04.333 --> 01:56:05.093]  Turmeric is incredible.
[01:56:05.553 --> 01:56:07.114]  All three of these are 25% off individually.
[01:56:08.454 --> 01:56:16.418]  But right now if you get all three, the trifecta, you get 40% off and it keeps us on air and it funds the operation.
[01:56:16.618 --> 01:56:17.758]  Look, these are already great sellers.

[01:56:41.163 --> 01:57:11.003]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are being monitored.
[01:57:11.003 --> 01:57:13.003]  You are the resistance.
[01:57:13.388 --> 01:57:15.128]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:57:18.090 --> 01:57:30.596]  Alright, we've got more here from Matt Gaetz on this continued resolution.
[01:57:30.676 --> 01:57:32.376]  Let me just quickly recap.
[01:57:32.376 --> 01:57:41.576]  You have 15 Republicans.
[01:57:41.768 --> 01:57:43.750]  This was the last update.
[01:57:44.150 --> 01:57:46.252]  I haven't seen a new update.
[01:57:46.272 --> 01:57:49.936]  15 Republicans refusing to vote for this continued resolution.
[01:57:52.218 --> 01:57:53.279]  Many familiar names.
[01:57:53.319 --> 01:57:55.121]  They're usually on the right side of these issues.
[01:57:55.382 --> 01:57:57.604]  Andy Biggs, Dan Bishop, Lauren Boebert.
[01:57:59.335 --> 01:58:00.856]  Yeah, there's that name, Lauren Boebert.
[01:58:01.497 --> 01:58:04.840]  And now conservatives are doing the Democrats' work of trying to get her out of Congress.
[01:58:04.900 --> 01:58:05.660]  Way to go, guys.
[01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:06.060]  Nice.
[01:58:06.381 --> 01:58:06.861]  Real good idea.
[01:58:07.281 --> 01:58:19.151]  Ken Buck, Kim Burchett, Eli Crane, Matt Gaetz, MTG, Corey Mills, Ralph Norman, Andy Ogles, Matt Rosendale, Victoria Spartz, Ana Paulina Luna, Paul Gosar.
[01:58:20.112 --> 01:58:24.756]  We've seen some pretty good statements from Matt Gaetz, Andy Ogles, Victoria Spartz.
[01:58:27.578 --> 01:58:28.599]  We've got more on it now.
[01:58:30.148 --> 01:58:34.471]  From Matt Gaetz, the 8% cut is only for 30 days.
[01:58:34.651 --> 01:58:37.213]  The border policy will be ignored by Biden.
[01:58:37.874 --> 01:58:41.797]  This continued resolution funds the election interference of Jack Smith.
[01:58:42.457 --> 01:58:47.962]  This is a terrible bill, lumping the funding of disparate agencies of government into one bad vote.
[01:58:48.102 --> 01:58:50.003]  This isn't what we fought for in January.
[01:58:50.223 --> 01:58:53.226]  It is the opposite and it doesn't have the votes.
[01:58:54.778 --> 01:59:00.442]  Congressman Ogles, with exactly the right answer, single subject spending bills.
[01:59:01.502 --> 01:59:06.245]  It is unfortunate that due to poor leadership, there will be a shutdown during this process.
[01:59:06.366 --> 01:59:09.908]  It will be painful and the leaders who blew this deadline must be dealt with.
[01:59:12.403 --> 01:59:24.430]  But what is more painful is an immediate future with 2 trillion annual deficits, a top of 32 trillion dollar debt, no more games, no more continued resolutions, single subject spending bills, or bust.
[01:59:26.291 --> 01:59:40.280]  Now, I really don't know what the out here is for these 15 Republicans, because McCarthy's not going to budge, and obviously the Democrats are going to try to ram through whatever spending bill Biden wants.
[01:59:42.455 --> 01:59:47.258]  So you gotta start thinking outside the box, and you gotta start finding a way to get a victory.
[01:59:48.539 --> 01:59:59.126]  And if I'm these 15 Republicans, I'm thinking you either have two options, and really this is I think what it comes down to.
[01:59:59.166 --> 02:00:07.571]  You either have two options, and that's that you form this voter bloc that will stop the House from moving anything forward and shut down the government.
[02:00:09.032 --> 02:00:10.073]  I'm perfectly fine with that.
[02:00:11.641 --> 02:00:13.702]  Shut it down indefinitely, for all I care.
[02:00:13.722 --> 02:00:20.923]  Huh, I mean, the government's only trying to put my ass in jail and keep me on probation for ten years, so I mean, hell!
[02:00:24.104 --> 02:00:33.546]  Yeah, the government that wants to arrest me and incarcerate me for my speech, uh, oh no, it's gonna be shut down, oh my gosh, oh I'm heartbroken, oh I'm crying.
[02:00:36.207 --> 02:00:54.983]   Uh, but aside from that, So either you decide you're going to be a voting bloc that's going to stall anything and shut down the government, or you decide it's time to bring the political long knives out against Kevin McCarthy.
[02:00:55.204 --> 02:01:05.249]  And you say, okay, I'll tell you what, McCarthy, if you want our votes on this continued resolution, then you put your career on the line.
[02:01:07.822 --> 02:01:13.989]  You say that this continued resolution will protect the southern border.
[02:01:15.931 --> 02:01:20.156]  You say that this continued resolution will block all funding to Ukraine.
[02:01:20.236 --> 02:01:38.639]   So then, put your money where your mouth is, if a single illegal immigrant crosses the border after this continued resolution, If a single penny is sent to Ukraine after this continued resolution, then Kevin McCarthy must resign as Speaker of the House.
[02:01:39.299 --> 02:01:41.140]  So then you know you're at least going to get that.
[02:01:44.223 --> 02:01:46.004]  Now, would McCarthy ever agree to that?
[02:01:46.404 --> 02:01:48.786]  Of course not, and that's the point.
[02:01:50.043 --> 02:01:57.469]  You're proving Kevin McCarthy is lying when he says this bill will stop the illegal immigration and stop the funding to Ukraine.
[02:01:57.749 --> 02:01:59.611]  Then put your money where your mouth is, bud!
[02:02:00.391 --> 02:02:02.373]  But he won't do it because he knows it's a lie.
[02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:10.205]  I mean, hell, if you wanted to even go after Byron Donalds, who I think is one of the good guys, you'd say the same thing to Byron Donalds.
[02:02:10.225 --> 02:02:25.537]  Say, Byron, if you really believe this is going to secure the southern border and stop funding the war in Ukraine, then you put your money where your mouth is and you'll resign the minute an illegal immigrant comes across this border and the minute a penny is sent to Ukraine after this continued resolution is voted for.
[02:02:27.919 --> 02:02:28.960]  But they're smarter than that.
[02:02:31.702 --> 02:02:32.603]  They're smarter than that.
[02:02:35.762 --> 02:02:37.202]  It's all illegal already anyway!
[02:02:38.403 --> 02:02:41.663]  Crossing... All the illegal immigration is already illegal immigrant.
[02:02:42.924 --> 02:02:51.566]  It's already illegal anyway, and now we have to have... We have to have negotiations in the House to decide whether we're going to keep allowing illegal immigrants or not.
[02:02:51.606 --> 02:02:52.926]  I mean, this thing is a joke.
[02:02:54.947 --> 02:02:56.307]  This whole Congress is a joke.
[02:02:59.208 --> 02:03:00.628]  Kevin McCarthy's an empty suit.
[02:03:04.929 --> 02:03:11.594]  And McCarthy at least has enough political wherewithal to support Donald Trump, but even that's probably fake.
[02:03:13.836 --> 02:03:14.896]  I wouldn't trust him, Donald.
[02:03:18.759 --> 02:03:26.925]  Federal judge again declares that DACA is illegal, so this thing has been declared illegal multiple times, but it just keeps happening.
[02:03:28.066 --> 02:03:29.427]  It just keeps happening.
[02:03:31.314 --> 02:03:37.958]  Los Angeles spends $44,000 per temporary tent in homeless village.
[02:03:39.479 --> 02:03:39.860]  Yeah.
[02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:42.561]  You know, I always wondered who's paying for these tents.
[02:03:42.841 --> 02:03:45.123]  We've got these massive tent cities in Austin, Texas.
[02:03:45.163 --> 02:03:45.943]  Very nice tents.
[02:03:45.963 --> 02:03:49.266]  We're talking, like, some of these tents, multiple hundreds of dollars, even $1,000.
[02:03:49.346 --> 02:03:50.226]  Very nice tents.
[02:03:51.827 --> 02:03:56.390]  Where do the homeless get the money to afford these $1,000 tents that they live in?
[02:03:56.410 --> 02:03:56.871]  Hmm.
[02:03:58.391 --> 02:03:58.892]  Interesting.
[02:04:00.222 --> 02:04:07.345]  Catering services and 24-7 staffing cost an additional $3 million per year, the Los Angeles Times is reporting.
[02:04:08.986 --> 02:04:09.806]  They get catering?
[02:04:12.327 --> 02:04:12.927]  Catering!
[02:04:16.069 --> 02:04:16.469]  Oh!
[02:04:16.909 --> 02:04:17.369]  Woo!
[02:04:18.410 --> 02:04:26.053]   So, we, oh, oh, and people will say, well, We can't send all the illegal immigrants home.
[02:04:26.093 --> 02:04:26.853]  There's just too many.
[02:04:26.893 --> 02:04:27.734]  We don't know what to do with them.
[02:04:28.154 --> 02:04:30.436]  But we know how to feed them all right, don't we?
[02:04:30.997 --> 02:04:38.983]  We know how to make sure that they're fed, and we know how to make sure they're accommodated as far as travel and lodging is concerned, but we certainly have no clue how to get them out of here, though.
[02:04:39.003 --> 02:04:39.924]  That's just impossible.
[02:04:39.964 --> 02:04:40.764]  We don't know.
[02:04:40.804 --> 02:04:47.270]  But they're well-fed, and they've got a house to stay in if it's a tent, and they've got catering 24-7 and everything else, but we have no idea!
[02:04:47.490 --> 02:04:48.591]  There's no way we can get them out!
[02:04:50.928 --> 02:04:56.250]  Stunning videos from Mexico, open train, cars taking hordes of migrants to Biden's open U.S.
[02:04:56.290 --> 02:04:56.550]  border.
[02:04:56.590 --> 02:04:58.091]  Anything on that, Kevin McCarthy?
[02:04:59.292 --> 02:05:00.512]  You think you're gonna stop that?
[02:05:00.532 --> 02:05:03.073]  Oh, it's just laughable.
[02:05:03.774 --> 02:05:04.434]  What a clown.
[02:05:06.715 --> 02:05:13.838]  UK health authorities erect biohazard tents following influx of sick migrants sparks fears of deadly virus outbreak.
[02:05:18.516 --> 02:05:20.458]  But you need to take a vaccine.
[02:05:20.738 --> 02:05:22.200]  You need to wear a mask.
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:26.164]  And then hordes of illegal immigrants with all kinds of diseases pour across the southern border.
[02:05:26.184 --> 02:05:28.827]  And you're supposed to just ignore that.
[02:05:30.969 --> 02:05:34.413]  Oh yeah, I'm sure Biden will stop sending money to Ukraine.
[02:05:36.363 --> 02:05:41.388]  Zelensky fires six deputy defense ministers as corruption scandals surge in Ukraine.
[02:05:41.908 --> 02:05:46.793]  Yeah, Zelensky's firing all the people that are saying, hey, maybe we should reach a peace deal.
[02:05:46.933 --> 02:05:50.217]  We're losing hundreds of thousands of our citizens now.
[02:05:51.438 --> 02:05:53.019]  And, oh, you said that?
[02:05:53.179 --> 02:05:53.520]  Fired.
[02:05:55.495 --> 02:05:56.515]  Senator J.D.
[02:05:56.555 --> 02:06:01.616]  Vance demands Biden administration reveal of transgender spokesperson for Ukraine military has U.S.
[02:06:01.656 --> 02:06:05.177]  intelligence ties after threats to hunt down Russian propaganda.
[02:06:05.217 --> 02:06:06.217]  Folks, you can't make this up.
[02:06:06.517 --> 02:06:07.638]  This is not satire.
[02:06:08.178 --> 02:06:12.218]  This is not mad TV or In Living Color or Saturday Night Live.
[02:06:12.559 --> 02:06:20.440]  There is literally an American transgender individual that is the Ukrainian military spokesperson.
[02:06:22.581 --> 02:06:24.361]  You cannot make this up.
[02:06:25.694 --> 02:06:27.636]  This is clown world.
[02:06:28.858 --> 02:06:31.841]  We are in fully blown clown world.
[02:06:31.881 --> 02:06:33.984]  I mean, folks, it's like they don't even try to fake it.
[02:06:34.004 --> 02:06:39.790]  It'd be like me up here in a wig and a beard telling you I'm, you know, a female athlete.
[02:06:39.850 --> 02:06:40.631]  Nobody would buy that.
[02:06:41.806 --> 02:06:46.430]  So in case you haven't noticed, our country is under attack, and Joe Biden is facilitating all of it.
[02:06:47.130 --> 02:06:49.832]  That was the entire purpose of getting him in office, actually.
[02:06:49.872 --> 02:06:54.076]  Compromised by the Chinese, compromised by the Russians, compromised by Ukraine.
[02:06:54.556 --> 02:06:55.937]  That's the Biden crime family.
[02:06:57.198 --> 02:06:59.880]  And so this story is wild.
[02:07:00.441 --> 02:07:04.464]  And, you know, really, I probably should have made a bigger deal of this today.
[02:07:05.954 --> 02:07:22.172]  Uh, but there's just so many other news stories, it's hard to, like I said, we're on a merry-go-round, except the lever's broken, the brakes are broken, the governor's off, there's no getting off, you can't even focus on anything, it's spinning so fast, and there's all kinds of clown horns going off all around you, so the noise interference is a bit of an issue.
[02:07:23.823 --> 02:07:26.506]  How do you lose an F-35?
[02:07:27.367 --> 02:07:27.627]  U.S.
[02:07:27.667 --> 02:07:30.611]  military can't find stealth jet after mishap.
[02:07:31.451 --> 02:07:37.939]  Pilot ejected safely from F-35B Lightning II, but there were no immediate crash reports.
[02:07:37.979 --> 02:07:42.123]  Military expert says the F-35 could likely travel hundreds of miles without its pilot.
[02:07:43.058 --> 02:07:47.403]  South Carolina Republican representative made a statement saying, how in the hell do you use an F-35?
[02:07:47.683 --> 02:07:49.245]  How is there not a tracking device?
[02:07:49.525 --> 02:07:53.610]  And we're asking the public to find, what, the jet and turn it in?
[02:07:55.352 --> 02:08:05.812]   Now look, I'm not somebody that has the military background to Answer the obvious question, which is, how does it not have a tracking device on it?
[02:08:06.332 --> 02:08:07.573]  Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
[02:08:07.593 --> 02:08:11.233]  Maybe we really make these things stealth so that we can't even track our own pilots.
[02:08:11.814 --> 02:08:12.734]  I don't know that.
[02:08:13.454 --> 02:08:16.095]  Maybe we'll take calls on that later this afternoon.
[02:08:16.115 --> 02:08:17.275]  I will be hosting the War Room.
[02:08:17.675 --> 02:08:22.736]  But now, this story gets a lot worse and more interesting.
[02:08:23.197 --> 02:08:26.977]  And now it reeks of intentional sabotage.
[02:08:27.618 --> 02:08:33.017]   It's being reported That this jet has landed in Cuba.
[02:08:36.299 --> 02:08:37.780]  This is the latest report.
[02:08:39.542 --> 02:08:42.003]  Is that it has apparently landed in Cuba.
[02:08:42.664 --> 02:08:43.945]  Now this whole thing is wild.
[02:08:44.005 --> 02:08:48.668]  The story could change ten times before I even sign off the air today later at six o'clock.
[02:08:51.210 --> 02:08:53.471]  But let's think about the ramifications of this.
[02:08:58.374 --> 02:09:03.960]   China has military installments and bases in Cuba.
[02:09:06.121 --> 02:09:17.905]  The F-35 is one of our most important aircraft technologies that we possess.
[02:09:19.965 --> 02:09:33.598]   Now you tell me how an F-35 goes rogue And then potentially lands where there is a Chinese military installment?
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:39.802]  And I'm supposed to believe that this is all organic and the U.S.
[02:09:39.822 --> 02:09:41.423]  government doesn't even know what the hell is going on?
[02:09:45.646 --> 02:09:46.326]  This is nuts.
[02:09:46.145 --> 02:09:55.305]   This is nuts. This is nuts. So again, I can't leap to any conclusions because I don't have the military intelligence
[02:09:55.305 --> 02:10:04.375]   to say, "Oh, we can absolutely track that plane and knew it all along," or, "No, we can't track that plane and really
[02:10:04.375 --> 02:10:07.145]  it probably is off our radar."
[02:10:07.145 --> 02:10:17.145]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:10:08.721 --> 02:10:09.421]  I don't know.
[02:10:12.863 --> 02:10:20.938]   And maybe we will just open up the phone lines on the war room for people that Have that military intelligence, or maybe even try to get a military guest on.
[02:10:20.978 --> 02:10:26.304]  I know I do have some other guests coming up, and there's a bunch of other news to cover, but I mean, folks, I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[02:10:26.944 --> 02:10:28.866]  Our country is being attacked.
[02:10:30.368 --> 02:10:35.314]  It's, it's, I mean, the First Amendment under attack, the Second Amendment under attack.
[02:10:36.886 --> 02:10:41.873]  Joe Biden attacking the American people with inflation and high energy prices and high taxes.
[02:10:42.213 --> 02:10:43.855]  The wide open southern border.
[02:10:44.376 --> 02:10:49.944]  Our military is run by sexually confused, deranged, liberal progressives.
[02:10:52.507 --> 02:10:54.510]  I mean, I'd love to chalk this up to incompetence.
[02:10:56.061 --> 02:11:00.745]  I'd love to talk this missing F-35 up to incompetence and just say, yeah, you know what?
[02:11:01.085 --> 02:11:10.113]  We got a military that's more concerned about dressing up as dogs for a sex kink that they have and making sure the government funds chopping off their balls.
[02:11:11.554 --> 02:11:19.461]  And so, yeah, an F-35 goes missing because our military is thinking about how to chop up balls and dress like Leather Daddy dog kink.
[02:11:21.314 --> 02:11:26.498]  I mean, oh yeah, I'd love to chalk that up to incompetence, and certainly there's a level of it, but no.
[02:11:27.059 --> 02:11:36.327]  This, this, this... You know that Clinton sold nuclear secrets to the Chinese, right?
[02:11:40.010 --> 02:11:45.935]  You know Joe Biden left a bunch of technology and bio-met- and bio-data in Afghanistan, right?
[02:11:50.816 --> 02:11:54.278]  You know Barack Obama gave Iran our drone technology, right?
[02:11:54.498 --> 02:12:01.498]  which Russia and China now also have access to.
[02:12:01.498 --> 02:12:06.058]   And now, and now it appears
[02:12:06.058 --> 02:12:10.738]   that China has made off with a US F-13.
[02:12:10.606 --> 02:12:20.926]   35 I mean I shouldn't be laughing but this is gallows humor at this point I
[02:12:20.926 --> 02:12:38.873]   mean I want to see it Honestly, maybe we should just go full SNL at this point, and I should just come on the war room today, and I should just be, I'll dress up as a leather daddy dog kink military general, and I've been neutered.
[02:12:40.455 --> 02:12:45.860]  Yeah, hi, I'm, uh, I'm General Spike.
[02:12:47.603 --> 02:12:52.744]  I'm General Sparky Spike from the leather dog kink branch of the U.S.
[02:12:52.784 --> 02:12:56.885]  military, happy here to tell you I am agender neutered.
[02:12:58.106 --> 02:13:03.327]  And we are missing an F-35, and we have no idea where it is, but I have no balls!
[02:13:03.607 --> 02:13:04.907]  Look at my dog mask!
[02:13:05.807 --> 02:13:07.408]  I'm the leader of the military.
[02:13:07.408 --> 02:13:15.807]  Joe Biden also gave Iran $6 billion today.
[02:13:16.708 --> 02:13:19.669]  Five Americans freed from Iranian prison as U.S.
[02:13:19.689 --> 02:13:22.730]  hands $6 billion over in controversial deal.
[02:13:23.010 --> 02:13:35.134]  You know, I'll be honest here, this is difficult because part of me says we gotta bring prisoners abroad home at all costs.
[02:13:35.154 --> 02:13:42.100]   I don't know if at all costs is fair to say, but I mean, I think it's fair to say this.
[02:13:42.860 --> 02:13:43.861]  We should have got a better deal.
[02:13:46.022 --> 02:13:49.184]  Now, I'm not going to complain that the Biden administration brought prisoners home.
[02:13:50.305 --> 02:13:50.965]  Not going to do that.
[02:13:53.006 --> 02:13:55.928]  I can't even imagine for them and their families how important this is.
[02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.990]  These dual citizens.
[02:14:00.511 --> 02:14:11.186]   But, you know, you just get the feeling that five prisoners For two and six billion dollars should have been a better deal for the U.S.
[02:14:11.226 --> 02:14:11.606]  somehow.
[02:14:12.646 --> 02:14:14.127]  But we just get raked over the coals.
[02:14:14.247 --> 02:14:15.927]  Every deal Biden makes is bad for us.
[02:14:17.288 --> 02:14:20.568]  But hey, I'm not going to not celebrate bringing American prisoners home.
[02:14:21.048 --> 02:14:25.270]  But again, it seems that our president has no negotiating skills whatsoever.
[02:14:25.730 --> 02:14:26.990]  And now there's an F-35 missing.
[02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:32.571]   And then Tom Cotton, who's been One of the good ones.
[02:14:33.131 --> 02:14:34.912]  People are wondering what happened to him.
[02:14:34.973 --> 02:14:37.274]  All of a sudden he's flopped on the Ukraine issue.
[02:14:38.635 --> 02:14:46.021]  I wrote to President Biden with my colleagues and urged him to provide Ukraine with the missiles its military needs to win.
[02:14:47.382 --> 02:14:49.083]  You can give them all the missiles in the world, they won't win.
[02:14:49.463 --> 02:14:52.306]  Not doing so will only prolong the war and cost lives.
[02:14:52.326 --> 02:14:53.727]  I mean that's just completely inaccurate.
[02:14:53.747 --> 02:14:54.267]  He knows that.
[02:14:54.287 --> 02:14:56.289]  So now people think Tom Cotton's been blackmailed.
[02:14:57.301 --> 02:15:00.968]  Because of this flip-flop and now voting with Lindsey Graham on war.
[02:15:01.088 --> 02:15:03.112]  Everybody assumes Lindsey Graham has, um...
[02:15:06.909 --> 02:15:12.431]  Maybe spent some time intimately with other men or something, and that's why he's blackmailed into all this stuff.
[02:15:13.231 --> 02:15:14.411]  I don't know.
[02:15:14.471 --> 02:15:17.192]  The flip-flop from Tom Cotton has people asking these questions.
[02:15:18.152 --> 02:15:26.835]  And no, Tom, you can give the Ukrainian military every missile that we have in our arsenal, and it still will not win them the war.
[02:15:26.975 --> 02:15:29.015]  It will not get any closer to ending the war.
[02:15:29.115 --> 02:15:30.576]  It will only prolonging the war.
[02:15:30.676 --> 02:15:38.619]   And because of your outright misrepresentation of this, Now people think you're blackmailed and maybe in a Lindsey Graham type situation.
[02:15:39.420 --> 02:15:45.643]  Does he spend the night there at... What's that house, that apartment in D.C.
[02:15:45.663 --> 02:15:48.764]  that they all like to snuggle up under the covers in?
[02:15:50.985 --> 02:15:53.206]  With that Democrat pollster Frank Luntz?
[02:15:57.096 --> 02:16:04.521]  They all get nice and huddled up around a fire with Frank Luntz, maybe Tom Cotton, maybe he's going to be joining them.
[02:16:05.722 --> 02:16:06.082]  All right.
[02:16:07.663 --> 02:16:11.025]  The Alex Jones Show rolls on.
[02:16:12.426 --> 02:16:18.991]  The other side of this break with the great Gerald Salente, the great trends forecaster, the great American.
[02:16:20.197 --> 02:16:21.258]  Always fired up.
[02:16:22.499 --> 02:16:25.301]  I will be returning to host the War Room.
[02:16:25.381 --> 02:16:41.133]  We've got a couple guests coming up, and I may have to call an audible because I had a ton of news already scheduled on the Paxton impeachment and some other big news and video clips, but this situation with the F-35 jet might need to be addressed head-on.
[02:16:42.719 --> 02:16:47.944]  And so we may just end up taking calls from the military because I just don't have the experience.
[02:16:47.984 --> 02:16:50.606]  I mean, could the F-35 literally be untrackable and traceable?
[02:16:50.726 --> 02:16:51.306]  It might be.
[02:16:51.366 --> 02:16:53.048]  It's hard to believe, but that could be the case.
[02:16:54.509 --> 02:16:59.213]  But then it apparently lands in Cuba right next to a Chinese military installment.
[02:16:59.693 --> 02:17:00.254]  Oh, OK.
[02:17:00.874 --> 02:17:01.815]  But don't say anything.
[02:17:01.875 --> 02:17:03.657]  Joe Biden, best president ever.
[02:17:03.697 --> 02:17:04.458]  We're so safe.
[02:17:04.478 --> 02:17:05.839]  We're so secure under Joe Biden.
[02:17:05.658 --> 02:17:12.658]   and he just gives our military secrets to every country that asks for them.
[02:17:12.658 --> 02:17:23.658]  [Music]
[02:17:23.658 --> 02:17:29.658]   My fellow patriots, the Trafecta has not been in stock for years.

[02:18:23.747 --> 02:18:35.837]  Hey, it's great being on the Alex Jones Show, and it's terrible what they're doing to Owen and anybody that speaks out against the crime syndicate that people call the government.
[02:18:37.298 --> 02:18:38.779]  And it's really, really terrible.
[02:18:38.919 --> 02:18:45.505]  And as I said, you better do everything you can to support InfoWars, because they're going to try to get rid of everybody they can.
[02:18:46.278 --> 02:18:48.880]  I'm wondering what they're going to come up with with me, you know?
[02:18:48.900 --> 02:19:02.551]  I mean, you get these things, you know, somebody says sexual harassment that happened, you know, a decade ago, and they believe what the woman says.
[02:19:03.332 --> 02:19:09.016]  But whether there's no proof or anything and the guys get chastised for it.
[02:19:10.097 --> 02:19:13.000]  You know, it's it's terrible.
[02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:15.662]  Yeah, there's crazy guys that abuse women.
[02:19:17.119 --> 02:19:21.262]  Well, you know, there's two sides to a lot of stories.
[02:19:23.324 --> 02:19:30.570]  And so they'll do anything they can to get rid of the people that are making the news and changing it.
[02:19:31.110 --> 02:19:33.532]  That's out of the mainstream gauntlet.
[02:19:34.072 --> 02:19:34.553]  So who knows?
[02:19:35.093 --> 02:19:37.055]  I'm telling you, women try to get in touch with me.
[02:19:37.075 --> 02:19:38.616]  You know, Mr. Slenty, we see you a lot.
[02:19:39.437 --> 02:19:40.577]  I am concerned.
[02:19:41.558 --> 02:19:45.761]  I'm totally concerned about meeting somebody that I don't know.
[02:19:46.870 --> 02:19:53.394]  You meet somebody that you don't know, and, um, and, uh, being accused of something.
[02:19:56.156 --> 02:19:59.918]  And so, uh, it's, it's very, very, very disturbing.
[02:20:00.398 --> 02:20:02.519]  Like what's going on with this Russell Brand.
[02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:08.823]  You know, they're branding him this because he's come out against the establishment so deeply.
[02:20:09.944 --> 02:20:12.065]  Like I've said, I've never raised my hand to a woman.
[02:20:12.085 --> 02:20:14.046]  Unless you want to be spanked.
[02:20:14.266 --> 02:20:15.847]  All right, take it easy, it's a joke, all right?
[02:20:18.539 --> 02:20:20.040]  Oh, no woman ever wants to be speaking.
[02:20:20.340 --> 02:20:21.000]  Take it easy.
[02:20:22.261 --> 02:20:25.522]  You know, I go to InfoWars all the time.
[02:20:27.362 --> 02:20:31.464]  And the stories that they're running about like RFK Jr., what he's saying.
[02:20:32.164 --> 02:20:33.505]  And I said this in the beginning.
[02:20:33.545 --> 02:20:34.665]  It was Alex Jones.
[02:20:34.965 --> 02:20:37.646]  I think I believe I said it in January.
[02:20:38.587 --> 02:20:42.468]  That the best candidate for president would be RFK Jr.
[02:20:44.068 --> 02:20:45.349]  and Judge Napolitano.
[02:20:46.923 --> 02:20:47.744]  For vice president.
[02:20:47.984 --> 02:20:48.604]  RFK Jr.
[02:20:48.624 --> 02:20:49.185]  for president.
[02:20:49.805 --> 02:20:53.028]  And I've been saying he should run on the libertarian ticket.
[02:20:53.729 --> 02:20:57.152]  Because much of what he says is in the libertarian consciousness.
[02:20:57.952 --> 02:20:59.193]  And I'm a political atheist.
[02:20:59.234 --> 02:21:00.435]  I don't belong to a party.
[02:21:00.975 --> 02:21:01.676]  It's not a party.
[02:21:01.696 --> 02:21:03.817]  It's a crime syndicate.
[02:21:04.278 --> 02:21:06.320]  Look at the slime balls that are in charge.
[02:21:06.820 --> 02:21:08.682]  Look at the slime balls that are in charge.
[02:21:09.002 --> 02:21:10.783]  How can you be so damn stupid?
[02:21:11.144 --> 02:21:12.625]  How can you be so stupid?
[02:21:15.603 --> 02:21:21.245]  How can you be so stupid to look up to a little, out of his mind, Mitch McConnell?
[02:21:22.785 --> 02:21:24.886]  Oh no, he didn't freeze, he didn't have a seizure.
[02:21:25.386 --> 02:21:27.007]  Oh, was he like that normally?
[02:21:27.247 --> 02:21:28.667]  Yeah, he's like that normally!
[02:21:28.948 --> 02:21:30.368]  The guy's out of his mind!
[02:21:31.428 --> 02:21:33.269]  Biden?
[02:21:33.309 --> 02:21:35.710]  Can't finish a sentence, doesn't know what he's talking about?
[02:21:35.730 --> 02:21:41.592]  Oh, he just BS'd that he was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania?
[02:21:42.535 --> 02:21:43.555]  And he didn't teach?
[02:21:43.936 --> 02:21:45.116]  Oh, he misspoke?
[02:21:45.336 --> 02:21:47.317]  He lied, or he's out of his mind!
[02:21:48.817 --> 02:21:50.018]  It's a freak show!
[02:21:51.618 --> 02:21:55.540]  So anyway, what they have on InfoWars, they're giving you all this great information.
[02:21:56.520 --> 02:21:58.261]  And it's very important that you support them.
[02:21:59.041 --> 02:22:00.202]  And they got great products.
[02:22:00.242 --> 02:22:02.923]  When you support them, you're supporting yourself.
[02:22:03.003 --> 02:22:04.523]  Again, it's that 360 win.
[02:22:05.564 --> 02:22:07.925]  You know, we're going to get into a lot of things that are going on.
[02:22:09.265 --> 02:22:11.646]  And this economy, man, it's over.
[02:22:12.404 --> 02:22:13.204]  It's over.
[02:22:14.244 --> 02:22:15.325]  The facts are there.
[02:22:15.465 --> 02:22:16.865]  We're reporting them weekly.
[02:22:17.345 --> 02:22:20.245]  We've been ahead of the trends beyond anybody.
[02:22:21.066 --> 02:22:24.386]  Nobody's talking about the office building bust.
[02:22:24.746 --> 02:22:30.807]  47 percent, 47 percent office occupancy rate in the 10 largest cities in America.
[02:22:31.047 --> 02:22:34.268]  That's according to Castle Systems with a K, not making it up.
[02:22:36.829 --> 02:22:41.130]   All the businesses that depended on commuters, Going out of business.
[02:22:41.810 --> 02:22:43.952]  And yeah, and all those vacant offices.
[02:22:45.073 --> 02:22:46.013]  It's going to be fine.
[02:22:46.534 --> 02:22:50.236]  The banking crisis that's coming is going to be the worst in American history.
[02:22:50.997 --> 02:22:51.617]  Stay tuned.
[02:22:51.977 --> 02:22:52.758]  Much more to come.
[02:22:53.599 --> 02:22:55.460]  Hello, everybody.
[02:22:55.580 --> 02:22:55.720]  Hello.
[02:22:55.740 --> 02:23:01.024]  All right, we're going to talk about what in the world is going on and what's next.
[02:23:01.164 --> 02:23:04.646]  Is this from the toilet paper record, the New York Times?
[02:23:05.367 --> 02:23:06.948]  They call themselves the paper record.
[02:23:06.988 --> 02:23:08.349]  For me, it's just a piece of crap.
[02:23:09.793 --> 02:23:11.333]  The big story in the front, right?
[02:23:13.634 --> 02:23:14.994]  Calling for climate pivot.
[02:23:16.335 --> 02:23:23.897]  New York's, thousands of New York City start demanding that the world leaders stop fossil fuel drilling.
[02:23:24.377 --> 02:23:28.978]  Hey, how come all you clowns don't show up for our peace rallies?
[02:23:29.499 --> 02:23:30.599]  What do you got, Lockjaw?
[02:23:31.317 --> 02:23:32.738]  You worried about climate change?
[02:23:33.038 --> 02:23:40.381]  Hey, I know you love that depleted uranium that the United States is sending to Ukraine.
[02:23:40.761 --> 02:23:43.423]  Oh, you just love to swallow it.
[02:23:44.863 --> 02:23:47.945]  How about those cluster bombs, you cluster Fs?
[02:23:48.985 --> 02:23:50.366]  You like them, don't you?
[02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:52.611]  Oh yeah!
[02:23:52.931 --> 02:23:58.975]  The war going on in Ukraine, all the bombs exploding, all the poison in the world.
[02:23:59.396 --> 02:24:01.617]  Oh, but you got Lockjaw about that!
[02:24:01.877 --> 02:24:02.638]  You know why?
[02:24:02.958 --> 02:24:05.220]  Because you're a bunch of cowards!
[02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:08.222]  You're a bunch of little cowards!
[02:24:08.662 --> 02:24:09.683]  Climate change?
[02:24:10.549 --> 02:24:16.293]  Hey, you like those other chemicals that the big companies put in our everything?
[02:24:16.973 --> 02:24:17.513]  I know.
[02:24:18.214 --> 02:24:22.156]  All the obesity in America with your ultra-processed foods.
[02:24:22.636 --> 02:24:23.277]  There you go.
[02:24:23.657 --> 02:24:25.038]  Worried about climate change?
[02:24:25.378 --> 02:24:25.978]  Don't worry.
[02:24:26.519 --> 02:24:28.100]  Nuclear war is coming.
[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:30.121]  Nuclear war is coming.
[02:24:31.061 --> 02:24:32.903]  You got freaks in charge.
[02:24:33.183 --> 02:24:35.044]  You got freaks in charge.
[02:24:35.744 --> 02:24:36.185]  You ready?
[02:24:37.565 --> 02:24:38.426]  Not making this up.
[02:24:39.580 --> 02:24:40.621]  Nuclear war's coming!
[02:24:41.401 --> 02:24:42.462]  And the freak in charge?
[02:24:42.762 --> 02:24:43.762]  And I gotta be careful.
[02:24:44.122 --> 02:24:50.266]  You know, they may try to kill me because of what I say and how I say it.
[02:24:50.646 --> 02:24:56.569]  There's this article over here, again, in the toilet paper record.
[02:24:57.970 --> 02:25:02.152]  How Biden's view of presidential military authority has broadened.
[02:25:03.214 --> 02:25:07.216]  Biden's view of presidential military authorities.
[02:25:07.697 --> 02:25:10.919]  To Joe Biden, I got five draft deferments.
[02:25:11.979 --> 02:25:14.321]  Biden's only three years older than me.
[02:25:15.121 --> 02:25:19.084]  I was that part of that thing when the Vietnam War was going on.
[02:25:20.244 --> 02:25:22.506]  And as I said, I was too stupid.
[02:25:22.706 --> 02:25:31.271]  I swallowed the crap and believed the baloney, just like the people believe it now with Russia, that if we don't stop them Russians, they're going to be all over Europe.
[02:25:31.883 --> 02:25:33.584]  They said the same thing with Vietnam.
[02:25:33.624 --> 02:25:38.645]  If we don't stop those commies, those dominoes are going to keep falling.
[02:25:39.365 --> 02:25:43.246]  And all of Asia will become communist, and those dominoes will hit the shores of California.
[02:25:43.266 --> 02:25:44.427]  I'm not making that up.
[02:25:45.567 --> 02:25:46.327]  So I believed it.
[02:25:47.027 --> 02:25:49.068]  But I did everything I could to avoid the drift.
[02:25:49.108 --> 02:25:50.008]  I didn't want to get shot.
[02:25:50.608 --> 02:25:57.510]  I'm seeing these guys walking to water this high, gowns over their head, 50, 60 pounds of weight on their back, and getting shot.
[02:25:57.530 --> 02:25:58.471]  I said, I don't want to do this.
[02:25:59.291 --> 02:25:59.951]  So I admit it.
[02:26:01.258 --> 02:26:03.478]  I did everything I could to stay out of the draft.
[02:26:03.999 --> 02:26:05.119]  I didn't want to go to college.
[02:26:06.679 --> 02:26:10.080]  Out of college, I want to open up a delegate test in the Parkchester in the Bronx.
[02:26:11.220 --> 02:26:12.900]  I go to my father, I said, Dad, what should I do?
[02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:14.021]  They're drafting everybody.
[02:26:14.041 --> 02:26:16.241]  He said to me, listen, I got my own problems.
[02:26:16.281 --> 02:26:17.801]  I taught you enough, you figure it out.
[02:26:18.642 --> 02:26:21.662]  I got the second stupidest school in America, the only place I could get into.
[02:26:21.682 --> 02:26:24.443]  I barely got out of high school to avoid the draft.
[02:26:24.843 --> 02:26:28.443]  But Biden, five draft deferments.
[02:26:29.364 --> 02:26:33.733]   And then when they ran out, He got another one.
[02:26:33.773 --> 02:26:34.294]  You know what?
[02:26:35.734 --> 02:26:38.055]  He had asthma as a teenager.
[02:26:39.255 --> 02:26:42.477]  Oh, this is the guy that bragged what a great athlete he was in college?
[02:26:43.137 --> 02:26:44.777]  But he can't go fight in Vietnam?
[02:26:46.158 --> 02:26:46.398]  Yeah.
[02:26:46.978 --> 02:26:47.959]  So here's the article.
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:27:13.689]   If elected to a second term, President Biden pledged He would go to Congress to start any major war, but said he believed he, he, the guy that's out of his mind, was empowered to, quote, to direct limited US military operations abroad.
[02:27:13.709 --> 02:27:16.530]  Boy, that's sexist, abroad.
[02:27:16.970 --> 02:27:17.510]  Oh, no.
[02:27:17.871 --> 02:27:21.432]  Abroad, end quote, without such approval.
[02:27:24.079 --> 02:27:30.043]  When such strikes served critical American interests.
[02:27:30.463 --> 02:27:33.025]  You mean like stealing oil out of Syria?
[02:27:33.585 --> 02:27:34.066]  No, no.
[02:27:34.146 --> 02:27:35.887]  How about getting it out of Libya?
[02:27:36.327 --> 02:27:37.688]  I forgot Iraq!
[02:27:38.108 --> 02:27:39.269]  Oh, Halliburton?
[02:27:39.669 --> 02:27:42.972]  Oh, the one that slimeball was on?
[02:27:43.212 --> 02:27:44.432]  I can't say the word.
[02:27:44.853 --> 02:27:46.174]  I don't want to be censored.
[02:27:46.754 --> 02:27:47.995]  Penis Cheney?
[02:27:48.976 --> 02:27:50.997]  You can't call him Dick Cheney.
[02:27:52.308 --> 02:27:53.249]  On Halliburton?
[02:27:53.529 --> 02:27:57.053]  You think we would have went into Iraq if their major export was broccoli?
[02:27:57.533 --> 02:27:59.094]  That's America's interests?
[02:27:59.655 --> 02:28:00.536]  No, Biden!
[02:28:01.136 --> 02:28:05.220]  America only goes to war when we are threatened directly.
[02:28:06.862 --> 02:28:10.125]  As the Founding Fathers had made clear.
[02:28:11.506 --> 02:28:12.006]  Goes on.
[02:28:13.328 --> 02:28:13.608]  Quote.
[02:28:14.924 --> 02:28:25.610]  As President, I have taken great care to ensure that military actions carried out under my command... UNDER MY COMMAND?!
[02:28:26.050 --> 02:28:26.990]  HEIL HITLER!
[02:28:27.251 --> 02:28:29.932]  YOU ARE JUST A LITTLE SLAVE OF AMERICA!
[02:28:30.472 --> 02:28:31.533]  I AM IN COMMAND!
[02:28:31.973 --> 02:28:33.174]  I WILL TAKE YOU TO WAR!
[02:28:33.194 --> 02:28:35.555]  I WILL KILL ANYBODY THAT I WANT!
[02:28:38.656 --> 02:28:51.493]   ...carried out under my command comply with this constitutional framework And that my administration consults with Congress to the greatest extent possible, he wrote in response to the New York Times survey.
[02:28:52.414 --> 02:28:59.036]  I will continue to rigorously apply this framework to any potential actions in the future.
[02:29:00.256 --> 02:29:00.636]  You ready?
[02:29:01.716 --> 02:29:08.459]  The reply stood in contrast to his answer in 2007 when he was running for president.
[02:29:08.799 --> 02:29:12.800]  Like they all do, they lie their way into office if they can get in.
[02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:16.011]  When he was also running for president.
[02:29:17.152 --> 02:29:34.220]  Quote, the Constitution is clear, except in response to an attack or the imminent threat of attack, only Congress may authorize war and the use of force.
[02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:35.821]  End quote.
[02:29:38.978 --> 02:29:42.700]  One little clown taking us out to war after another.
[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:44.121]  One little clown.
[02:29:44.521 --> 02:29:45.081]  I forgot.
[02:29:45.361 --> 02:29:48.343]  The Nobel Piece of Crap Prize winner.
[02:29:49.123 --> 02:29:50.684]  Barack Obama!
[02:29:51.064 --> 02:29:53.185]  Hey, you see what's going on in Syria?
[02:29:53.765 --> 02:29:57.327]  Oh, only about 11,000 people have died from the floods?
[02:29:58.347 --> 02:29:58.868]  Oh yeah.
[02:29:59.508 --> 02:29:59.628]  Oh.
[02:30:00.328 --> 02:30:01.489]  Toilet paper record.
[02:30:01.529 --> 02:30:02.129]  Here it is.
[02:30:02.149 --> 02:30:02.870]  Here's the flood.
[02:30:02.910 --> 02:30:03.350]  You ready?
[02:30:04.150 --> 02:30:06.871]  Libya ignored dire warnings about its dams.
[02:30:07.472 --> 02:30:07.832]  Dammit.
[02:30:08.433 --> 02:30:09.013]  You know why?
[02:30:09.433 --> 02:30:13.094]  Because they slaughtered Gaddafi.
[02:30:13.914 --> 02:30:17.134]  Libya was the most, the richest country in Africa.
[02:30:17.695 --> 02:30:23.336]  The people had more rights and benefits than anybody in Africa and in a lot of parts of the world.
[02:30:24.056 --> 02:30:32.637]  But then, when the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, Barack Obama, hey, Gaddafi has to go.
[02:30:33.197 --> 02:30:35.078]  Oh no, only an Italian would say that.
[02:30:35.338 --> 02:30:36.798]  You have to be proper, sir, don't you?
[02:30:37.098 --> 02:30:40.650]   Folks, Folks, he was always folks, folks, folksing us.
[02:30:41.530 --> 02:30:42.631]  Qaddafi has to go.
[02:30:44.192 --> 02:30:45.413]  Oh, and Hillary Clinton?
[02:30:45.433 --> 02:30:48.395]  On CBS News?
[02:30:49.476 --> 02:30:51.858]  How did she feel when they found out Qaddafi was killed?
[02:30:52.878 --> 02:30:56.261]  We came, we saw, he died, hee hee hee.
[02:30:56.681 --> 02:30:57.482]  Not making it up.
[02:30:57.862 --> 02:30:58.482]  Google it up.
[02:30:59.883 --> 02:31:00.904]  Look what they did to Libya.
[02:31:01.765 --> 02:31:03.566]  Look what they're doing to one country after another.
[02:31:04.588 --> 02:31:05.689]  All these little clown heads.
[02:31:05.789 --> 02:31:06.489]  Climate change?
[02:31:07.089 --> 02:31:07.789]  Climate change?
[02:31:07.809 --> 02:31:10.611]  Hey, did you get rid of the PCPs in Hudson River over here yet?
[02:31:11.211 --> 02:31:12.672]  What are you talking about climate change?
[02:31:14.592 --> 02:31:16.613]  You're killing us in a thousand different ways.
[02:31:17.614 --> 02:31:19.094]  Nobody coming out for peace.
[02:31:19.635 --> 02:31:20.495]  Hardly anybody.
[02:31:20.915 --> 02:31:22.236]  I launched Occupy Peace.
[02:31:22.656 --> 02:31:24.697]  I do everything I can to push a peace.
[02:31:25.657 --> 02:31:29.319]  I had almost 1,500 people here in May.
[02:31:30.139 --> 02:31:32.220]  Not one piece of coverage.
[02:31:32.924 --> 02:31:34.805]  Not even a local stupid newspaper.
[02:31:35.865 --> 02:31:36.946]  But hey!
[02:31:37.426 --> 02:31:38.666]  Climate change!
[02:31:39.106 --> 02:31:40.307]  Worried about climate change?
[02:31:41.087 --> 02:31:43.548]  Nuclear war is on the near horizon.
[02:31:43.948 --> 02:31:45.789]  You got the maniacs in charge.
[02:31:45.809 --> 02:31:47.390]  Hey!
[02:31:47.490 --> 02:31:48.890]  I'll tell you what to do!
[02:31:49.951 --> 02:31:54.212]  Democracy, we're bringing freedom and democracy to other countries as we steal it from you.
[02:31:55.333 --> 02:31:56.353]  Yeah, that's America.
[02:31:56.813 --> 02:31:58.254]  A-M-E-R-I-K-A.
[02:31:59.454 --> 02:32:02.795]  The U.S.S.A., the United Soviet States of America.
[02:32:03.155 --> 02:32:04.916]  And throw fascism in there, too.
[02:32:05.236 --> 02:32:07.157]  The merger of state and corporate powers.
[02:32:09.898 --> 02:32:16.540]  Again, do everything you can to support InfoWars, because InfoWars is doing everything they can to support you.
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:20.601]  It's a freak show out there, and the freaks are running the show.
[02:32:21.182 --> 02:32:22.082]  We have to stop it.
[02:32:22.102 --> 02:32:24.563]  I hate being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:25.722 --> 02:32:30.206]  And, as I keep saying, do everything you can to support Infowars.
[02:32:30.366 --> 02:32:31.747]  Journalism is dead.
[02:32:32.508 --> 02:32:33.268]  It's finished.
[02:32:34.369 --> 02:32:35.050]  They've killed it.
[02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:37.932]  The bigs have taken over all the companies.
[02:32:37.952 --> 02:32:39.613]  They're firing people like crazy.
[02:32:39.633 --> 02:32:41.475]  There's hardly anyone there.
[02:32:46.018 --> 02:32:46.318]  Ready?
[02:32:47.459 --> 02:32:53.284]  After layoff, Gannett is hiring Taylor Swift and Beyoncé journalists.
[02:32:54.557 --> 02:32:55.717]  Hey, hey, Katsum.
[02:32:56.198 --> 02:33:06.981]  There's no such thing as calling somebody to follow Taylor Swift and Beyonce a journalist.
[02:33:07.762 --> 02:33:08.242]  All right?
[02:33:11.623 --> 02:33:13.904]  That's not journalism, jerks!
[02:33:17.985 --> 02:33:19.746]  This is reported by the Washington Post.
[02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:34.068]  Months after ordering layoffs to shrink local newsrooms, the country's largest newspaper chain is hiring journalists to exclusively cover two people, Taylor Swift and Beyoncé, Noel's daughter.
[02:33:37.490 --> 02:33:39.491]  Gannett posted two want ads.
[02:33:42.593 --> 02:33:50.156]   One for a multi-hypernate writer, photographer, And social media expert.
[02:33:50.176 --> 02:33:51.597]  I thought you were talking about journalism.
[02:33:53.479 --> 02:33:58.944]  With quote, an undeniable thirst for all things Taylor Swift.
[02:34:00.665 --> 02:34:05.309]  And another reporter to quote, tap into stories about Beyonce.
[02:34:07.611 --> 02:34:08.732]  That's journalism?
[02:34:09.813 --> 02:34:12.655]  It shows you how low this country has fallen.
[02:34:16.198 --> 02:34:17.019]  It's a joke.
[02:34:18.154 --> 02:34:19.395]  There is no journalism.
[02:34:21.035 --> 02:34:27.859]  What InfoWars is giving you and what we're giving you with the Trends Journal, you're not going to find anywhere else.
[02:34:28.699 --> 02:34:29.359]  It's gone.
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:45.467]  And again, when you get out there and you challenge the system too much, you get branded, like Russell branded.
[02:34:46.288 --> 02:34:46.808]  That's right.
[02:34:48.587 --> 02:34:53.048]  Oh, people hate me because they don't like my language and I'm angry.
[02:34:54.048 --> 02:34:57.569]  You have to speak properly when somebody's trying to kill you.
[02:34:57.929 --> 02:34:58.409]  Oh, please.
[02:34:58.429 --> 02:34:59.930]  Oh, don't shoot me.
[02:35:00.270 --> 02:35:01.310]  I'll be a good boy.
[02:35:01.330 --> 02:35:02.970]  Oh, please.
[02:35:03.411 --> 02:35:04.751]  Don't break into my home.
[02:35:06.051 --> 02:35:08.152]  As you're robbing me and killing me.
[02:35:08.712 --> 02:35:09.272]  Trying to.
[02:35:11.593 --> 02:35:12.313]  They're killing us.
[02:35:12.333 --> 02:35:15.894]  They're destroying this country in front of our eyes.
[02:35:16.794 --> 02:35:17.534]  You bet I'm angry.
[02:35:18.706 --> 02:35:21.407]  As you all know, I quote St.
[02:35:21.447 --> 02:35:32.553]  Thomas Aquinas, who said that it is moral to be angry when there's injustice.
[02:35:34.493 --> 02:35:41.693]  And it's immoral not to be angry when there's injustice.
[02:35:41.693 --> 02:35:48.733]  They call this journalism?
[02:35:48.823 --> 02:35:49.183]  You ready?
[02:35:49.203 --> 02:35:51.504]  It gets even dumber than that.
[02:35:55.585 --> 02:36:02.388]  Taylor Swift is an artist and businesswoman whose work has tremendous economic, cultural, and societal significance.
[02:36:02.828 --> 02:36:12.351]  Kristen Roberts, Gannett's chief content author, said in a statement, she is shaping a generation and is relevant, influential, and innovative.
[02:36:14.190 --> 02:36:21.374]  And she called Beyonce a force in the world of business, music, fashion, and our culture.
[02:36:22.894 --> 02:36:25.956]  Our role is to cover the newsmakers, you ready?
[02:36:26.736 --> 02:36:28.277]  Who run the world.
[02:36:31.078 --> 02:36:37.441]  Influence our society, impact our lives, and create positive change.
[02:36:38.242 --> 02:36:40.123]  You think this is positive change?
[02:36:41.743 --> 02:36:42.884]  What are you talking about?
[02:36:44.056 --> 02:36:45.156]  What are you talking about?
[02:36:48.977 --> 02:36:50.318]  I put on a concert.
[02:36:52.918 --> 02:36:55.159]  It was 1977 or 78, I forgot.
[02:36:57.979 --> 02:36:59.620]  With Ella Fitzgerald.
[02:37:04.281 --> 02:37:06.121]  At the Atlanta Convention Center.
[02:37:08.162 --> 02:37:15.646]   And we went backstage, she said that my former wife Reminded her of a goddaughter Carmen.
[02:37:15.666 --> 02:37:17.107]  This is Ella Fitzgerald.
[02:37:18.788 --> 02:37:20.609]  Not this, not this show.
[02:37:21.710 --> 02:37:22.251]  Nothings.
[02:37:23.391 --> 02:37:24.752]  I put on a concert.
[02:37:25.353 --> 02:37:26.254]  The Superdome.
[02:37:27.715 --> 02:37:28.775]  With Don Warwick.
[02:37:29.756 --> 02:37:33.039]  After we had the trade show, I was the number two guy running a major trade association.
[02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:42.886]  After the trade show, we put on a dinner and an event for the people that participated in the trade show.
[02:37:45.285 --> 02:37:47.166]  This is what America's sunk down to.
[02:37:50.448 --> 02:37:54.871]  Going back to Biden, CBS poll just came out.
[02:37:55.651 --> 02:37:59.133]  Only 34% of voters think Biden would complete second term.
[02:38:00.234 --> 02:38:01.715]  The guy can't complete the first term.
[02:38:01.735 --> 02:38:03.056]  What are you talking about?
[02:38:04.857 --> 02:38:05.998]  So here's my forecast.
[02:38:06.078 --> 02:38:07.078]  Biden is not going to run.
[02:38:08.359 --> 02:38:13.122]  Biden will not run in the 2024 presidential reality show.
[02:38:14.815 --> 02:38:16.115]  And it won't be Kamala Harris.
[02:38:16.135 --> 02:38:16.996]  She won't win either.
[02:38:18.516 --> 02:38:21.197]  Maybe that got some Gavin Newsom over there, the arrogant.
[02:38:21.557 --> 02:38:24.158]  My daddy worked for the Getty family.
[02:38:24.218 --> 02:38:25.118]  He was a lawyer.
[02:38:25.498 --> 02:38:26.858]  And I'm a daddy's boy.
[02:38:27.418 --> 02:38:33.060]  And I went up to the French Laundry and had dinner while I told everybody to lock down Gavin Newsom.
[02:38:34.940 --> 02:38:37.041]  My forecast is Biden's not going to run.
[02:38:38.581 --> 02:38:39.082]  He's done.
[02:38:39.102 --> 02:38:40.662]  And they know it.
[02:38:42.364 --> 02:38:46.768]  And the polls that come out and say that Trump would beat Biden, you got to look at the other polls.
[02:38:47.128 --> 02:38:48.409]  The people don't want either of them.
[02:38:50.791 --> 02:38:52.572]  And I believe if RFK Jr.
[02:38:52.612 --> 02:38:56.635]  runs on a libertarian ticket, he has a shot.
[02:38:59.357 --> 02:39:01.819]  The people are tired of the crime syndicate.
[02:39:01.839 --> 02:39:02.620]  You look at the data.
[02:39:03.541 --> 02:39:04.281]  You look at the data.
[02:39:04.301 --> 02:39:05.542]  They have no faith in Congress.
[02:39:06.783 --> 02:39:08.865]  They rank Congress near used car salesmen.
[02:39:09.986 --> 02:39:11.487]  Oh, that's being sexist.
[02:39:12.062 --> 02:39:16.105]  Huge car sales people can't save salesmen.
[02:39:16.965 --> 02:39:21.088]  So the only men are lousy used car dealers, sellers.
[02:39:22.149 --> 02:39:23.089]  Let's stay stupid.
[02:39:24.810 --> 02:39:27.152]  And we come back, we're going to talk about the economy.
[02:39:28.713 --> 02:39:30.454]  This just came out on CNBC.
[02:39:31.395 --> 02:39:36.118]  Americans plan to keep cutting back on spending throughout the holidays.
[02:39:36.198 --> 02:39:37.439]  New survey shows.
[02:39:39.634 --> 02:39:42.636]  How long ago did we warn about this in the Trends Journal?
[02:39:43.337 --> 02:39:48.700]  We said the economy's gonna look good during the summer, cause it's summertime and the livin' is easy.
[02:39:49.881 --> 02:39:52.963]  You spread your wings and you make to the sky.
[02:39:53.444 --> 02:39:55.725]  Summertime, summertime, sum-sum-summertime.
[02:39:56.045 --> 02:39:57.667]  Oh, there's no those happy songs anymore.
[02:39:57.947 --> 02:39:59.508]  No, we got Beyoncé and I forgot.
[02:39:59.928 --> 02:40:00.328]  Anyway.
[02:40:01.890 --> 02:40:03.511]  The summer state of mind's over now.
[02:40:04.031 --> 02:40:05.232]  Reality's setting in.
[02:40:05.811 --> 02:40:06.711]  Oh, gas prices?
[02:40:07.292 --> 02:40:07.912]  Brent crude?
[02:40:08.292 --> 02:40:10.433]  Oh, it's only at $94 a barrel.
[02:40:10.453 --> 02:40:11.473]  Don't worry about it.
[02:40:11.893 --> 02:40:12.793]  Don't worry about it.
[02:40:12.833 --> 02:40:14.394]  We're worried about core inflation.
[02:40:17.055 --> 02:40:17.755]  This is real.
[02:40:18.195 --> 02:40:19.076]  It's going to get worse.
[02:40:19.576 --> 02:40:22.737]  You better prepare and prevail to prosper.
[02:40:24.057 --> 02:40:29.019]  We're going to go through a system of economic decline globally like we've never seen before.
[02:40:29.399 --> 02:40:32.100]  Oh, the ECB raised interest rates last week.
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:33.681]  What will that, what does that mean?
[02:40:34.361 --> 02:40:34.521]  Yeah.
[02:40:35.197 --> 02:40:36.238]  A lot more's coming up.
[02:40:36.518 --> 02:40:36.998]  Stay tuned.
[02:40:37.699 --> 02:40:40.021]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:40:40.621 --> 02:40:46.665]  And do what you can to support them, because InfoWars is doing everything they can to support you.
[02:40:47.386 --> 02:40:49.527]  And you can see what's happening one after another.
[02:40:50.348 --> 02:41:00.995]  Once you start getting out there and giving an alternative to the lies and loss of freedom, they go after you.
[02:41:01.856 --> 02:41:02.937]  No question about it.
[02:41:04.355 --> 02:41:05.956]  You don't want to take that COVID jib?
[02:41:06.016 --> 02:41:07.898]  Well, then you believe in misinformation.
[02:41:08.478 --> 02:41:11.080]  Which I find sexist calling it misinformation.
[02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:13.862]  Let's call it gender information.
[02:41:15.823 --> 02:41:16.203]  Anyway.
[02:41:17.844 --> 02:41:18.685]  So do what you can.
[02:41:18.725 --> 02:41:21.667]  You know, as I said, I go to InfoWars every day.
[02:41:21.687 --> 02:41:23.628]  I want to see what they're reporting on.
[02:41:24.229 --> 02:41:27.651]  And one of the articles they have up is about the homeless problem.
[02:41:28.412 --> 02:41:30.253]  They're spending, like, all this money.
[02:41:31.194 --> 02:41:32.675]  Millions and millions of dollars.
[02:41:33.891 --> 02:41:39.214]  To build these tent things, you know, in cities.
[02:41:39.234 --> 02:41:40.815]  I mean, you got to check out the article there.
[02:41:44.298 --> 02:41:54.624]  And this year, one of our top trends for 2023 is the homeless solution.
[02:41:56.785 --> 02:41:58.867]  But it's being totally ignored.
[02:41:58.907 --> 02:41:59.387]  There you go.
[02:41:59.467 --> 02:42:06.710]   Los Angeles spends $44,000 For temporary tent for homeless villagers.
[02:42:06.730 --> 02:42:06.710]  $44,000.
[02:42:06.770 --> 02:42:08.432]  This is only a beginning.
[02:42:09.293 --> 02:42:12.155]  All the money that they put quote putting people in quote shelters.
[02:42:13.016 --> 02:42:22.324]  And these quote shelters are nothing more than deals they make with people that give a lot of money to the politicians and cities to put them in these places and charge ridiculous prices.
[02:42:22.945 --> 02:42:24.186]  So there's our top trend.
[02:42:26.167 --> 02:42:27.108]  The homeless solution.
[02:42:27.849 --> 02:42:28.970]  So here's the homeless solution.
[02:42:31.733 --> 02:42:35.915]  I'm up here in Kingston, New York, the foothills of the Catskill Mountains.
[02:42:37.076 --> 02:42:43.098]  Once upon a time, this used to be called this area, a little northwest of here, the Borscht Belt.
[02:42:44.439 --> 02:43:00.847]  Because the people used to come up from New York City, a lot of the Jewish people, and they had Grosingers up here, they had Brown, they had all these great resorts where the top, top comedians and entertainers used to play.
[02:43:03.024 --> 02:43:05.966]  And then what happened was, the jets set.
[02:43:07.708 --> 02:43:12.511]  And this is like, starts happening in the mid-1960s.
[02:43:14.313 --> 02:43:16.654]  So by the 80s, these places went out.
[02:43:16.915 --> 02:43:19.657]  Come on down, Eastern Airlines!
[02:43:19.737 --> 02:43:20.557]  Come on down!
[02:43:20.577 --> 02:43:22.739]  You know, you take a trip to Florida, people flying jets.
[02:43:23.159 --> 02:43:25.641]  They're not coming up to the country anymore.
[02:43:27.042 --> 02:43:29.024]  This beautiful, beautiful land.
[02:43:31.112 --> 02:43:40.836]  Turn these into homeless, it was Boys Town, when they took these kids and put them in Boys Town, like that old movie used to talk about.
[02:43:41.436 --> 02:43:43.017]  Let's create homeless towns.
[02:43:43.857 --> 02:43:45.638]  Get the people out of the cities.
[02:43:48.039 --> 02:44:00.439]   We're spending, by this time, as it keeps getting worse, it's going to be trillions of dollars throughout the United States Taking care of the homeless.
[02:44:00.779 --> 02:44:02.260]  Get them out of the cities.
[02:44:03.801 --> 02:44:05.301]  You want to go to San Francisco?
[02:44:05.322 --> 02:44:06.702]  You want to have a lousy time?
[02:44:08.623 --> 02:44:09.004]  LA?
[02:44:09.124 --> 02:44:10.304]  One place after another?
[02:44:10.364 --> 02:44:10.925]  New York?
[02:44:12.406 --> 02:44:13.886]  Get them out of the cities.
[02:44:16.388 --> 02:44:19.129]  And put them in, let's create homeless towns.
[02:44:21.871 --> 02:44:23.432]  Teach them how to, skills.
[02:44:24.973 --> 02:44:28.515]  Whether it's woodworking, how to paint.
[02:44:29.844 --> 02:44:30.464]  How to cook.
[02:44:33.565 --> 02:44:37.407]  In the warm weather months, farming, growing their own food.
[02:44:39.468 --> 02:44:41.788]  Creating these beautiful homeless towns.
[02:44:42.469 --> 02:44:44.089]  And you can do it all over America.
[02:44:45.010 --> 02:44:50.051]  Because once you get out of the cities, once you get out of the suburbs, you got a lot of empty land everywhere.
[02:44:51.792 --> 02:44:55.413]  To take over these buildings all over the place, they're doing it in Kingston too.
[02:44:56.294 --> 02:45:05.080]   And put in homeless people, and they're walking the streets all over the place, Peeing, pooping, throwing garbage, doing crazy stuff out of there might get him out of here.
[02:45:08.921 --> 02:45:10.102]  Build homeless towns.
[02:45:11.542 --> 02:45:16.923]  And the other article up on InfoWars is about Fetterman.
[02:45:19.864 --> 02:45:29.607]  The guy, the stroke guy, out of his mind, that's the senator from Pennsylvania.
[02:45:31.983 --> 02:45:38.568]  And now, the article on InfoWars, about how they changed the dress code.
[02:45:40.529 --> 02:45:47.275]  And now, Senate ends dress code so Fetterman could dress like a slob.
[02:45:48.696 --> 02:45:50.077]  Look how disgusting this looks.
[02:45:51.438 --> 02:45:53.459]  It's the slobbing down of America.
[02:45:54.060 --> 02:45:57.282]  This country's going down in front of our eyes.
[02:45:58.363 --> 02:46:01.105]  This was not the United States that I grew up in.
[02:46:02.443 --> 02:46:10.305]  This was not the United States that the immigrants all over the world wanted to come to.
[02:46:11.466 --> 02:46:13.146]  Like my parents' generation.
[02:46:14.367 --> 02:46:15.907]  May their soul rest in peace.
[02:46:18.248 --> 02:46:20.829]  This picture of my parents' wedding.
[02:46:20.849 --> 02:46:20.829]  1934.
[02:46:22.708 --> 02:46:24.708]  1934.
[02:46:24.708 --> 02:46:28.728]  See it?
[02:46:28.728 --> 02:46:33.748]  Get that picture?
[02:46:33.748 --> 02:46:34.748]  Bye.
[02:46:34.748 --> 02:46:34.748]  Bye.
[02:46:34.748 --> 02:46:36.288]  [CLICK]
[02:46:35.852 --> 02:46:36.312]  Look at them.
[02:46:37.853 --> 02:46:38.274]  Look at them.
[02:46:39.274 --> 02:46:41.256]  Look at the dignity and grace.
[02:46:42.637 --> 02:46:44.378]  My father worked in a fish store.
[02:46:45.899 --> 02:46:47.260]  My mother was a secretary.
[02:46:48.601 --> 02:46:50.442]  My Aunt Zinzi right next to her.
[02:46:51.683 --> 02:46:54.705]  She used to package things in a warehouse.
[02:46:56.947 --> 02:46:58.408]  They were construction workers.
[02:47:00.009 --> 02:47:01.270]  This was America!
[02:47:03.041 --> 02:47:07.601]  34 at the height of the Great Depression.
[02:47:07.601 --> 02:47:14.800]  And look how low it's gone.
[02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:24.801]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:47:15.885 --> 02:47:17.926]  And you listen to the music back then.
[02:47:19.166 --> 02:47:20.466]  Upbeat and lifting.
[02:47:20.486 --> 02:47:24.047]  Grab your coat and take your hat.
[02:47:24.807 --> 02:47:26.868]  Leave your worries by the doorstep.
[02:47:27.548 --> 02:47:31.669]  Life could be so sweet on the sunny side of the street.
[02:47:33.357 --> 02:47:36.058]  I used to walk in the shade with the blues on parade.
[02:47:37.178 --> 02:47:37.398]  Yep.
[02:47:38.718 --> 02:47:41.779]  But not anymore, you know, I got to be happier than Rockefeller.
[02:47:42.439 --> 02:47:43.519]  That was America.
[02:47:44.859 --> 02:47:49.440]  And it's gone from this to dressing like a slob.
[02:47:50.100 --> 02:47:57.162]  But Thederman, or Chuckie Schumer, it was the guy, you know, you could dress like that, according to that article.
[02:47:58.282 --> 02:48:03.103]  He exemplifies how low America has fallen.
[02:48:03.991 --> 02:48:05.272]  That's our Senate.
[02:48:05.752 --> 02:48:07.572]  A Senate of slobs.
[02:48:09.233 --> 02:48:12.935]  This is the fall of the Roman Empire right in front of our eyes.
[02:48:13.755 --> 02:48:19.397]  When you watch those movies about, you read the books about how deranged everybody became.
[02:48:21.258 --> 02:48:23.038]  And why did the Roman Empire go down?
[02:48:24.779 --> 02:48:26.700]  Same reason one after another goes down.
[02:48:27.461 --> 02:48:28.321]  They didn't have enough.
[02:48:28.381 --> 02:48:29.742]  They kept starting wars.
[02:48:30.402 --> 02:48:32.302]  The world gotta do what we want them to do.
[02:48:32.902 --> 02:48:34.062]  We're in charge.
[02:48:36.003 --> 02:48:36.303]  Yeah.
[02:48:40.264 --> 02:48:43.084]  Again, united we stand, divided we die.
[02:48:43.665 --> 02:48:44.625]  We must unite.
[02:48:45.665 --> 02:48:49.566]  The 2024 elections may be our last chance.
[02:48:50.646 --> 02:48:54.467]  That's if they don't annihilate us with a nuclear war before then.
[02:48:55.225 --> 02:49:00.208]  Because as I say, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:49:00.608 --> 02:49:11.135]  Could you imagine that comedian who used to play the piano with his penis, who became the President of Ukraine, is now coming back to the United States?
[02:49:12.896 --> 02:49:23.423]  Oh, he's spending all that money for homeless people, 61% of the people living paycheck to paycheck, and over $130 billion of our money going over there?
[02:49:24.810 --> 02:49:25.230]  For what?
[02:49:27.011 --> 02:49:28.572]  To keep bloodying the killing fields?
[02:49:28.672 --> 02:49:28.952]  No!
[02:49:29.373 --> 02:49:37.937]  To enrich the military-industrial complex that Dwight D. Eisenhower, five-star General, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, and two-term President warned us about.
[02:49:37.957 --> 02:49:45.842]  That the military-industrial complex is robbing the nation of the genius of scientists, the sweat of the laborers, and the future of the children.
[02:49:47.143 --> 02:49:48.744]  So unite with InfoWars.

[02:51:40.719 --> 02:51:41.160]  All right.
[02:51:42.501 --> 02:51:46.484]  You know, now we're going to go on to what in the world is going on in the economy.
[02:51:48.180 --> 02:51:52.063]  You know, there's an article that came out this past Friday in the Wall Street Journal.
[02:51:52.143 --> 02:51:53.885]  Store workers face more danger.
[02:51:55.386 --> 02:51:59.089]  Retailers say organized theft and violent incidents are on the rise.
[02:52:01.110 --> 02:52:14.941]  Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell said last month that the retailer recorded 120% increase in theft incidents involving violence or threats of violence during the first five months of the year.
[02:52:16.222 --> 02:52:22.962]   I'm noting this Because none of this happened before they launched the COVID war.
[02:52:23.663 --> 02:52:32.813]  And as I noted to you, everyone listening and everyone that subscribes to the Trends Journal knows it, the politicians called it a war.
[02:52:34.094 --> 02:52:34.555]  That's right.
[02:52:35.055 --> 02:52:35.976]  From Trump on down.
[02:52:36.817 --> 02:52:37.658]  They called it a war.
[02:52:37.698 --> 02:52:38.519]  We're fighting a war.
[02:52:38.539 --> 02:52:39.240]  We're fighting a war.
[02:52:39.260 --> 02:52:40.141]  Globally they did this.
[02:52:41.838 --> 02:53:01.333]  So when they say they're fighting a war, they're spreading fear and hysteria and people march off to war, just like over 80% marched off to the Afghan war, and believe the crap spewing out of the mouth of a little ignorant nobody of a clown boy with a pair of cojones, small and a mothball, and about that dick the rest of it.
[02:53:02.754 --> 02:53:03.895]  George W. Bush.
[02:53:03.955 --> 02:53:07.597]   My daddy was George H.W.
[02:53:07.637 --> 02:53:11.660]  Bush and my granddaddy was Prescott Bush and I'm a member of the club.
[02:53:12.641 --> 02:53:13.862]  They swallowed that crap.
[02:53:13.902 --> 02:53:15.623]  They swallowed the COVID war crap.
[02:53:16.604 --> 02:53:19.506]  The world has changed dramatically since the COVID war.
[02:53:20.306 --> 02:53:22.308]  This was not going on like this before.
[02:53:22.888 --> 02:53:26.351]  The homeless situation you have wasn't this bad before.
[02:53:26.371 --> 02:53:29.473]  The crime rates weren't like this.
[02:53:30.314 --> 02:53:33.976]  All the cars that are being stolen, this wasn't going on before that.
[02:53:35.337 --> 02:53:36.418]  The COVID war did it.
[02:53:37.483 --> 02:53:50.428]  Now, I mentioned that we're going to watch the economy go down, because what you have to look at are the numbers in the manufacturing index.
[02:53:51.888 --> 02:54:04.633]  So, as the economy was going up, they said the economy was going up in the last, you know, several weeks, several months, the last quarter, because as we said, people are traveling.
[02:54:07.705 --> 02:54:17.788]  They're not sending them on products because your manufacturing rates in Europe, in Germany, in China, they're below 50%.
[02:54:20.729 --> 02:54:23.050]  And anything below 50% is contraction.
[02:54:23.790 --> 02:54:25.310]  So people aren't buying anything.
[02:54:25.630 --> 02:54:26.671]  They're not buying anything.
[02:54:26.771 --> 02:54:30.352]  They're buying a lot less because they can't afford it because of inflation.
[02:54:31.052 --> 02:54:44.246]   As I mentioned, gasoline prices now, bread crude, here in Kingston, In this area, Dutchess County, regular gas is sold for $4 a gallon.
[02:54:47.848 --> 02:54:54.430]  So, what we're talking about is that people can't afford to buy things.
[02:54:55.591 --> 02:54:58.712]  When they show, like for example, they'll say that retail sales went up.
[02:54:58.752 --> 02:54:59.192]  No, they didn't.
[02:54:59.232 --> 02:55:00.572]  Not when you put inflation into it.
[02:55:00.953 --> 02:55:01.453]  They're down.
[02:55:03.033 --> 02:55:08.875]   So now, with the holiday season coming, you're going to start seeing A big decline.
[02:55:09.395 --> 02:55:12.136]  And we're saying this because we want you to prepare for the worst.
[02:55:12.677 --> 02:55:13.457]  Gold prices.
[02:55:13.356 --> 02:55:15.996]  Well, gold's like in 1922 is when we're on the air.
[02:55:15.996 --> 02:55:25.356]   Gold prices are only going to go up when interest rates go down.
[02:55:25.356 --> 02:55:35.356]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:55:26.561 --> 02:55:30.002]  And the guests on the street is they're going to raise them one more time in America.
[02:55:30.742 --> 02:55:33.563]  Probably not on Wednesday when the Fed meets again.
[02:55:34.263 --> 02:55:36.404]  But they just raised them again over there in Europe.
[02:55:37.688 --> 02:55:39.890]  And this is going to bring the European economy down.
[02:55:40.510 --> 02:55:42.352]  Germany is already in a recession.
[02:55:42.392 --> 02:55:44.734]  It's the fourth largest economy in the world.
[02:55:47.316 --> 02:55:48.557]  And the largest in Europe.
[02:55:50.119 --> 02:55:52.481]  And their manufacturing index is negative.
[02:55:53.401 --> 02:55:56.504]  And now with the higher interest rates, the bad situation is going to get worse.
[02:55:56.884 --> 02:55:58.746]  And now the travel season is over in Europe.
[02:56:00.027 --> 02:56:01.688]  We're going back to spending less.
[02:56:01.708 --> 02:56:02.069]  You ready?
[02:56:04.791 --> 02:56:05.051]  U.S.
[02:56:05.091 --> 02:56:08.463]   retailers Listen carefully.
[02:56:10.244 --> 02:56:19.270]  We'll hire the lowest number of seasonal workers for this holiday season since, take a guess, 2008.
[02:56:22.612 --> 02:56:25.614]  The panic of 08.
[02:56:26.354 --> 02:56:30.193]  I took that domain name out in 2007.
[02:56:30.193 --> 02:56:41.594]   According to a report by Challenger Gray and Christmas, provided exclusively to Reuters,
[02:56:41.594 --> 02:56:49.154]   retailers are expected to add just 410,000 seasonal jobs this season.
[02:56:49.154 --> 02:56:59.154]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:56:54.765 --> 02:57:08.211]   To an analysis of non-seasonally adjusted data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics by the Global Outplacement of Obama, That is just slightly above the 324,900 workers they added in the last quarter of 2008.
[02:57:08.271 --> 02:57:11.313]  Now, again, 410,000 new seasonal jobs now, about 325,000 back in 2008.
[02:57:11.353 --> 02:57:12.954]  Look how much the population has grown since then.
[02:57:12.853 --> 02:57:25.013]   Now, again, 410,000 new seasonal jobs now, about 325,000 back in 2008.
[02:57:25.013 --> 02:57:30.893]  Look how much the population has grown since then.
[02:57:30.893 --> 02:57:33.974]  And look how much inflation has gone up since then.
[02:57:33.974 --> 02:57:38.572]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:57:38.466 --> 02:57:38.726]  U.S.
[02:57:38.806 --> 02:57:40.946]  retailers added 519,400 jobs in the last quarter of 2022.
[02:57:40.986 --> 02:57:42.587]  A 26% decline from the same period 2021.
[02:57:42.466 --> 02:57:45.226]  jobs in the last quarter of 2022.
[02:57:45.226 --> 02:57:57.225]  Never 2022, a 26% decline from the same period 2021.
[02:57:57.225 --> 02:58:00.106]  And now it's gonna get worse than that.
[02:58:00.106 --> 02:58:09.466]   The COVID war has destroyed the lives and livelihoods of billions of people across the planet.
[02:58:09.466 --> 02:58:19.466]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:58:12.690 --> 02:58:19.330]   We have never gone in, we have never gone this far into September and not had big hiring
[02:58:19.330 --> 02:58:24.609]   predictions from retailers, said Andrew Challenger, Senior Vice President of Challenger Gray and Christmas.
[02:58:24.609 --> 02:58:31.889]  You ready?
[02:58:32.012 --> 02:58:52.821]  US-based companies have so far announced just 8,000 planned hires for the holiday season compared with 258,201 planned hires announced by employers by this point in 2022.
[02:58:53.101 --> 02:58:56.843]  Again, according to Challenger Greg Christmas tracking.
[02:59:00.044 --> 02:59:01.325]  It's hurting people everywhere.
[02:59:02.150 --> 02:59:07.953]  Inflation, driving up consumer credit card debt by billions of dollars.
[02:59:10.634 --> 02:59:14.036]  Drivers are skipping car insurance after premiums increase.
[02:59:15.816 --> 02:59:16.657]  Very important.
[02:59:17.557 --> 02:59:25.541]  Money funds attract $1 trillion in funds so far in 2023.
[02:59:25.821 --> 02:59:26.321]  You know why?
[02:59:27.362 --> 02:59:29.303]  Because interest rates are going up.
[02:59:29.363 --> 02:59:30.323]  It's going to go wider.
[02:59:30.363 --> 02:59:31.464]  Markets are going to go down.
[02:59:32.788 --> 02:59:38.273]  You buy money market funds, treasuries, and you're getting like 5% on your money.
[02:59:38.333 --> 02:59:39.293]  Why are you going to gamble?
[02:59:41.735 --> 02:59:44.918]  This, this, and a lot, lot, lot, lot more.
[02:59:44.958 --> 02:59:48.020]  Last week's Trends Journal is over 180 pages.
[02:59:48.060 --> 02:59:49.081]  You read what you want.
[02:59:50.082 --> 02:59:51.483]  And you can listen to it too.
[02:59:53.105 --> 02:59:54.946]  We cover the world like nobody else.

[03:00:10.588 --> 03:00:11.108]  You know why?
[03:00:11.868 --> 03:00:13.909]  Because we are American patriots.

[03:00:21.173 --> 03:00:25.015]  I'm only me because I'm a Napolitano, born in the Bronx, born to be free.
[03:00:25.035 --> 03:00:28.537]  If I was born in Alta Vila or Pino di Caquenza, it wouldn't be me.
[03:00:29.375 --> 03:00:32.557]  And that's why we're giving you everything we can, as InfoWars is.
