[00:00:07.512 --> 00:00:13.474]  The genetic editing of plants to contain edible vaccines is well underway.
[00:00:13.474 --> 00:00:22.097]  Work is being done with bananas, potatoes, tomatoes, lettuce, rice, wheat, soybeans, and corn.
[00:00:22.097 --> 00:00:29.399]  Companies like Medicago are using gene editing to turn plants into mini bioreactors.
[00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:38.263]  Medicago's manufacturing facility looks like a nursery, but inside these plants they're growing a new kind of vaccine.
[00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:41.764]  The technology is called a virus-like particle.
[00:00:41.764 --> 00:00:49.948]  At Medicago, we use a careful step-by-step process to develop vaccines using our plants as mini bioreactors.
[00:00:49.948 --> 00:00:50.808]  We start with the gene
[00:00:50.828 --> 00:00:51.608]  We're good to go!
[00:01:08.615 --> 00:01:14.762]  We submerge the plants in a bath with the bacteria that carries the information into the plant cells.
[00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:20.328]  And using a vacuum, we suck out the air between the plant cells and replace it with the liquid.
[00:01:20.328 --> 00:01:21.890]  The plants absorb it like a sponge.
[00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:32.603]  At the end of their bacterial bath, we return our plants to a carefully controlled greenhouse to let them get on with their natural growing business for at least four days.
[00:01:32.603 --> 00:01:38.727]  Now the plants will start producing the most important ingredient of our vaccines, virus-like particles.
[00:01:39.247 --> 00:01:43.850]  Gene editing is now officially in our meat industry.
[00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:54.655]  Lobbyists for the Cattlemen and Pork Associations in several states have confirmed that they will be using the mRNA COVID vaccines on their livestock.
[00:01:54.655 --> 00:02:03.140]  Attorney Tom Renz has been warning that there is no law requiring anyone to give informed consent for vaccine food.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.283]  There are no laws requiring anyone to tell you the food you are buying has been vaxxed with the spike protein clotshot.
[00:02:12.283 --> 00:02:18.365]  The UK recently passed into law the Genetic Technology Precision Breeding Bill.
[00:02:18.365 --> 00:02:29.108]  The bill amends the Environmental Protection Act of 1990 to exclude references to precision-bred organisms so far as they relate to marketing.
[00:02:29.828 --> 00:02:34.471]  Precision-bred organism is another term for gene-edited.
[00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:41.856]  So now in the UK, food that's been gene-edited can be legally marketed as non-GMO.
[00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:49.901]  And if this UK gene-edited meat makes its way to America, it can be labeled non-GMO here as well.
[00:02:49.901 --> 00:02:54.884]  And so long as it's butchered in America, it can be labeled product of USA.
[00:02:56.107 --> 00:03:03.649]  The fake alternative meat being pushed by Bill Gates and others is made of immortal cell lines.
[00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:07.010]  In other words, cancerous tumor cells.
[00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.591]  Real meat is being blamed for climate change.
[00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:16.153]  And a recent independent study suggests that most of our meat is already contaminated.
[00:03:17.353 --> 00:03:29.262]  Using infrared spectroscopy and electron microscopy, Dr. Ana Maria Mialcia has been studying the blood of the vaxed and the unvaxed for over a year now.
[00:03:29.262 --> 00:03:35.126]  And at first, she was finding the same contamination in only the blood of the vaxed.
[00:03:35.126 --> 00:03:43.493]  A contamination that she describes as ribbon-like structures, much like the mysterious blood clots being found by coroners.
[00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:50.898]  But lately, she's been finding these ribbon-like structures in the blood of the unvaxed as well.
[00:03:50.898 --> 00:04:02.266]  By measuring the frequency of one of these mysterious rubbery blood clots, Dr. David Jenigan has developed a way of detecting the same frequency in the vaxed.
[00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:08.551]  Recently, he's found this unique frequency in the meat being sold in his local grocery store.
[00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:13.036]  And asked Dr. Mielsia to confirm his findings.
[00:04:13.036 --> 00:04:23.970]  Her microscopy showed that the blood samples taken from products in the grocery store were all contaminated with the similar ribbon-like structures found in the blood of the vaxxed.
[00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:42.005]  Most of the meat in the grocery store is from overseas, and if we want to eat uncontaminated meat, we'll have to start buying direct from farms in America that still produce all-natural organic protein and take back control of our democidal government.
[00:04:42.005 --> 00:04:45.667]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:48.490]  Bill Gates always promised to contaminate the food supply.
[00:04:50.106 --> 00:04:51.968]  There is no regulation, no control.
[00:04:51.968 --> 00:04:54.389]  We are all under total attack.
[00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.731]  The illnesses, the infertility will only explode.
[00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:57.272]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:57.272 --> 00:05:01.835]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:08.060]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[00:05:11.485 --> 00:05:17.387]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for President 2024 shirt.
[00:05:17.387 --> 00:05:19.807]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[00:05:19.807 --> 00:05:23.788]  This is an idea the crew had to have a triggering shirt, kind of next level.
[00:05:23.788 --> 00:05:25.049]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:29.390]  There's InfoWars.com on the back, Alex Jones for President 2024 on the front.
[00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.430]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.711]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:33.051]  It's high quality.
[00:05:33.051 --> 00:05:36.452]  And it is a exclusive shirt to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:36.452 --> 00:05:38.292]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[00:05:38.292 --> 00:05:39.413]  We're doing one run.
[00:05:40.313 --> 00:05:40.633]  No way.
[00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:40.814]  No way.
[00:05:40.814 --> 00:05:42.055]  That's a bridge too far.
[00:05:42.055 --> 00:05:42.556]  No, it can't be.
[00:05:42.556 --> 00:05:46.340]  And I said on national television that he was going to win.
[00:06:11.184 --> 00:06:15.568]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:15.568 --> 00:06:18.350]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.551]  It's Friday, April 7th, 2023.
[00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:24.695]  I'm your host Alex Jones, one of the original founding members of the Black Panther Party.
[00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.830]  Thank you so much for joining us here today.
[00:06:59.136 --> 00:07:11.826]  Alright, I've got all this war news, economy news, Democrat storming Capitol news, trans cult promising more violence, being caught planning more mass shootings.
[00:07:11.826 --> 00:07:21.794]  We've got a lot here, but it's important to go to the foundation of what's happening, to go to the very root cause of the situation.
[00:07:21.794 --> 00:07:27.479]  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the transhumanist movement.
[00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:36.074]  And the whole trans agenda is only a small part of that.
[00:07:36.074 --> 00:07:44.019]  And so again, here today, I'm gonna be laying out what the future is going to look like.
[00:07:44.019 --> 00:07:54.064]  Now, a lot of people are finding shows I did 20 years ago, 15 years ago, five years ago,
[00:07:56.533 --> 00:08:01.794]  And they're saying, how did Jones predict all of this?
[00:08:01.794 --> 00:08:03.275]  And it's not about me being right.
[00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:22.539]  It's about understanding that the globalists that beta test this at think tanks and research facilities and universities and public schools and private schools on young children have been building the new world they're now rolling out in beta and now they're going operational.
[00:08:22.539 --> 00:08:25.240]  So the general public is now discovering trends
[00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:38.211]  Abled movement where you cut your arms and legs off or pour Drano in your eyes and the government helps you do it and then pays for you to be blind.
[00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:49.315]  People are now discovering a huge movement of adults not working and saying their babies and crapping their diapers and living in large playpens.
[00:08:49.315 --> 00:08:56.418]  But if you go back 20 years ago, this was being pushed as an official mental illness to be adopted by the people.
[00:08:58.934 --> 00:09:06.798]  So now it's all over the place and people are adopting it because they're told, this is your career move.
[00:09:06.798 --> 00:09:08.019]  This is what you should do.
[00:09:08.019 --> 00:09:10.380]  This is a fun thing for you to do.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:18.244]  And again, it's all designed to destroy society, but it's not coming from the innate mental illness of these people.
[00:09:18.244 --> 00:09:22.526]  It's coming from a system that promotes it and offers it as an option.
[00:09:22.526 --> 00:09:24.847]  First time I saw it was about 20 years ago.
[00:09:24.847 --> 00:09:27.429]  And back then it wasn't on the news.
[00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:39.655]  Listeners sent me reports and even photos of it, of all places at a university I remember in Kansas City.
[00:09:39.655 --> 00:09:52.661]  And when conservative Tea Party people came to protest, even before it was called the Tea Party, it was a pro-gun rally, the school handed out coloring books and Play-Doh and Crayolas.
[00:09:53.607 --> 00:10:01.309]  And brought out little benches, little tables that would be for about a three-year-old that are about a foot off the ground.
[00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:07.771]  And the people were told, sit down and play with Play-Doh because you're scared.
[00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:17.714]  Then later we saw cases of someone handed out in Oregon at a university, if I remember correctly, pocket constitutions.
[00:10:17.714 --> 00:10:19.074]  And oh, they were so upset.
[00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:26.469]  That the college rolled out that it had waiting in a warehouse.
[00:10:26.469 --> 00:10:37.056]  Barbie houses and blocks and Play-Doh and TV monitors playing The Little Mermaid.
[00:10:37.056 --> 00:10:39.057]  This is all CIA run.
[00:10:41.111 --> 00:10:48.634]  30 years ago, maybe 1,000s of the population liked to dress up in dresses if they were men.
[00:10:48.634 --> 00:10:54.756]  And if somebody likes to do that, knock yourself out, it don't hurt anybody.
[00:10:54.756 --> 00:11:00.917]  But it's being superimposed and forced to bring down society.
[00:11:00.917 --> 00:11:08.360]  And so I'm going to show you clips today, then I'll hit all the other news on AI and more, big developments there, examples of this.
[00:11:10.455 --> 00:11:28.805]  But then we've also got clips in places like the Netherlands where they show a high-functioning Down syndrome man who has a job, and there the trendy reporters, three of them, say, you cost three times more for society, you should just kill yourself.
[00:11:28.805 --> 00:11:30.266]  He says, well, I don't want to kill myself.
[00:11:34.187 --> 00:11:37.570]  Sad to have to tell them he doesn't want to die, but he's very sorry.
[00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:38.291]  He's a burden.
[00:11:38.291 --> 00:11:49.020]  So, on one hand they're promoting euthanasia, government-sponsored, pushing it, telling people to commit suicide, infanticide, all the rest of it.
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:59.669]  But they're over here saying the government will pay for you to have your penis cut off, or your testicles cut off, or your breasts cut off, and will pay welfare to you to live in a house as a baby, because you identify as that.
[00:12:01.089 --> 00:12:05.930]  They're even talking about social workers that will come down and change the diapers.
[00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:24.054]  And they're putting, in Michigan, this was confirmed two years ago, people didn't believe it, cat boxes for children to urinate and defecate in without telling the parents in elementary schools because they told the kids, the new gang, the new clique isn't the jocks or the
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:41.246]  Crap kickers, as we would call ourselves that wore boots and stuff, or the greasers like back in the 50s, or the pibs, you know, the kids that wear black, the rockers.
[00:12:41.246 --> 00:12:44.207]  No, it's you now defecate the cat box.
[00:12:44.207 --> 00:12:53.310]  And they keep files in the schools, this came out in Fox News two days ago, came out years ago, but it's back in the news, on what parents aren't going along with it and what parents are.
[00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.411]  And our siblings in the school that might tell the parents.
[00:12:56.624 --> 00:13:00.868]  They had hearings in Colorado and California in this last few days.
[00:13:00.868 --> 00:13:04.671]  I have the clips here today.
[00:13:04.671 --> 00:13:12.618]  Like in Glendale Unified School District, where they keep secret files on the parents.
[00:13:12.618 --> 00:13:15.241]  And this is brought up from the documents.
[00:13:15.241 --> 00:13:19.685]  And the school board person says, you're not allowed to talk about that.
[00:13:19.685 --> 00:13:21.586]  I'm not letting you speak.
[00:13:21.586 --> 00:13:22.788]  And just shuts him down.
[00:13:25.313 --> 00:13:37.298]  So this is an organized takedown of society, and I know you know this, but we have to understand how serious this is.
[00:13:37.298 --> 00:13:41.320]  Every major corporation is pushing it.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:48.283]  They're bringing in the social credit score that if you don't comply, you'll be attacked.
[00:13:48.283 --> 00:13:52.265]  And more importantly, the sperm counts down close to 90% in the Western world.
[00:13:55.012 --> 00:14:00.913]  IQs are plummeting, life expectancy is plummeting, we are being killed.
[00:14:00.913 --> 00:14:08.274]  We have more statistics and numbers on that today for major insurance companies and congressional hearings.
[00:14:08.274 --> 00:14:23.357]  And then, I remember covering it 25 years ago, it was on the drawing board, and in the last 5-10 they were testing it, now they've rolled out, there's no regulations, no one's blocking it, they're not even having congressional hearings, that they are injecting
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:44.193]  Self-replicating bacteria that produce nanosynthetic nanobot viruses for behavioral modification, the list goes on and on, that actually attack areas of the cerebral cortex and give you a type of lobotomy.
[00:14:45.165 --> 00:14:49.369]  They call them anti-stress, anti-depression vaccines.
[00:14:49.369 --> 00:15:01.262]  And if you think government proposals to keep fluoride in the water to dumb you down are bad, or major governments around the world proposing putting lithium in the water to make you behave yourself, which has been tested, an anti-psychotic,
[00:15:04.514 --> 00:15:10.841]  If you think that's bad, ladies and gentlemen, we are living in the equivalent of an alien invasion.
[00:15:10.841 --> 00:15:15.767]  And I'm not saying aliens are running this, but the globalists see themselves as building a new world.
[00:15:15.767 --> 00:15:17.509]  They say the future isn't human.
[00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:24.177]  So for all intents and purposes, they are aliens, because what they're building is so anti-human and so alien and will kill most of us.
[00:15:26.172 --> 00:15:36.261]  And so I want the message to go out to people that serve the system, the mercenaries, and the media, and the corporations, and the government, and the military, and everywhere else, and the controlled churches.
[00:15:36.261 --> 00:15:45.209]  You are going to be destroyed by this, so don't pretend because you just go, I don't give a damn, it's not going to be affecting you.
[00:15:45.209 --> 00:15:52.476]  And I'm telling you, God is real, and the fact that you don't resist this, you will be cut off from God forever.
[00:15:53.891 --> 00:15:54.991]  This is a test.
[00:15:54.991 --> 00:15:56.612]  The devil's making his move.
[00:15:56.612 --> 00:15:59.833]  Stay with us.
[00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:06.495]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[00:16:06.495 --> 00:16:08.436]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:16:08.436 --> 00:16:09.936]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:12.737]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[00:16:12.737 --> 00:16:14.738]  And it says political prisoner.
[00:16:15.538 --> 00:16:17.499]  With an image of President Trump.
[00:16:17.499 --> 00:16:19.941]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:22.082]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:16:22.082 --> 00:16:27.465]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[00:16:27.465 --> 00:16:28.666]  Jail background.
[00:16:28.666 --> 00:16:29.726]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:16:29.726 --> 00:16:33.849]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:16:33.849 --> 00:16:35.450]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:36.470]  No, I'm not running for President.
[00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.032]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[00:16:39.032 --> 00:16:39.812]  Red, white, and blue.
[00:16:39.812 --> 00:16:40.673]  Alex Jones for President.
[00:16:41.013 --> 00:16:43.455]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:16:43.455 --> 00:16:44.876]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:16:44.876 --> 00:16:49.259]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:17:10.091 --> 00:17:19.037]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:26.822]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:17:27.842 --> 00:17:30.725]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:17:30.725 --> 00:17:37.271]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:17:37.271 --> 00:17:40.314]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:17:40.314 --> 00:17:48.562]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:17:49.222 --> 00:17:53.547]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at M4Short.com.
[00:17:53.547 --> 00:17:58.493]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to M4Short.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:17:58.493 --> 00:17:59.274]  Please take action now.
[00:18:01.329 --> 00:18:11.038]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[00:18:11.038 --> 00:18:14.701]  We can't stay on air without your help, and I want to thank you all for your past support.
[00:18:14.701 --> 00:18:21.648]  And I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products at InfoWarsStore.com to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[00:18:22.188 --> 00:18:26.450]  Ultimate Bone Broth, finally sold out for over two years, back in stock.
[00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:29.191]  Real Red Pill Plus, simply amazing.
[00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:31.452]  Nitric, boosts what it does for your heart.
[00:18:31.452 --> 00:18:33.173]  Cardiovascular, critical.
[00:18:33.173 --> 00:18:41.237]  All these products, like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Supermelt Vitality, they're all available and in stock, ready to ship to you, right now on InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:18:41.237 --> 00:18:50.161]  And the final 1,200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, and I'm not gonna sign anymore after that, are exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com as well.
[00:18:50.401 --> 00:18:52.802]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[00:18:52.802 --> 00:18:53.662]  We didn't have them for sale.
[00:18:53.662 --> 00:18:55.443]  But now, I signed the last books.
[00:18:55.443 --> 00:18:59.925]  You can get them right now.
[00:18:59.925 --> 00:19:04.067]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[00:19:04.067 --> 00:19:07.809]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[00:19:07.809 --> 00:19:10.190]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.591]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:19:12.591 --> 00:19:15.132]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:19:15.892 --> 00:19:20.379]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[00:19:20.379 --> 00:19:23.784]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[00:19:23.784 --> 00:19:27.829]  They took the babies out of anti-marriage and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:19:27.829 --> 00:19:30.193]  It was almost as if there were a plan in motion.
[00:19:30.193 --> 00:19:31.234]  It just happened.
[00:19:31.875 --> 00:19:35.717]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:37.819]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:19:37.819 --> 00:19:39.460]  They are nothing but distraction.
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.661]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[00:19:41.661 --> 00:19:44.142]  You silenced those voices.
[00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:47.905]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[00:19:47.905 --> 00:19:54.329]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[00:20:01.505 --> 00:20:06.107]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:06.107 --> 00:20:19.592]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:19.592 --> 00:20:27.756]  Alright, I want to explain something here.
[00:20:27.756 --> 00:20:30.157]  This is absolutely central, critical, paramount.
[00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:39.479]  We're beyond central.
[00:20:39.479 --> 00:20:44.583]  I've been on the air 29 years in about two weeks.
[00:20:44.583 --> 00:20:55.031]  And I knew all this 29 years ago because I was reading the books by the hundreds of patriots that had studied the New World Order.
[00:20:55.031 --> 00:20:58.654]  People like G. Edward Grimpen, the list went on and on.
[00:20:58.654 --> 00:20:59.515]  People like Steve Quayle.
[00:21:00.914 --> 00:21:04.515]  Everything they talked about has come true.
[00:21:04.515 --> 00:21:08.696]  And the reason I give credit to them is it's not about the credit.
[00:21:08.696 --> 00:21:10.237]  Countless incredible minds.
[00:21:10.237 --> 00:21:17.079]  It's that I was reading all this 30 years ago, 35 years ago, and found it hard to believe.
[00:21:17.079 --> 00:21:23.481]  So I would go to the library and I would actually get the books that they were sourcing.
[00:21:23.481 --> 00:21:25.222]  And it was all true.
[00:21:25.222 --> 00:21:25.822]  I'm getting chills.
[00:21:26.715 --> 00:21:31.719]  I'm going to say this again, and finally Glenn Beck's talking about it, and so is Tucker Carlson, and so is Joe Rogan.
[00:21:31.719 --> 00:21:33.440]  It's great.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:40.286]  A few weeks ago, Tucker did a whole two segments on Aldous Huxley, and Julian Huxley, and the plan for transhumanism.
[00:21:40.286 --> 00:21:41.006]  It's all there.
[00:21:41.006 --> 00:21:46.731]  He wrote the damn book in 31, published it in 32, read the book, it all happened!
[00:21:46.731 --> 00:21:52.155]  And again, before he died in 61, he wrote another book, Brave New World Revisited, non-fiction, saying this is a real plan!
[00:21:53.362 --> 00:21:59.826]  So you read that book written in 1931 and 95% of it has been done!
[00:21:59.826 --> 00:22:00.866]  That's how I know!
[00:22:00.866 --> 00:22:05.469]  I'm getting massive chills right now.
[00:22:05.469 --> 00:22:13.973]  They are spiking the food, they are spiking the air, the water, the atmosphere, electromagnetic radiation.
[00:22:13.973 --> 00:22:16.895]  They are literally killing us.
[00:22:19.352 --> 00:22:28.499]  And if we sit here and take it, and let this be done to us, then, I mean, I really guess that we are this weak scum that has to be gotten rid of.
[00:22:28.499 --> 00:22:33.944]  But that's not the case, and we're here to stand for the children.
[00:22:33.944 --> 00:22:38.988]  So the leading edge of the cult is the minions that have been depressed, made autistic,
[00:22:39.724 --> 00:22:42.965]  Who are told, you're special, you're in a cool club now.
[00:22:42.965 --> 00:22:53.167]  You guys that were the nerds, or you guys that have, you know, the mental problems from all the chemicals and biologicals and radiologicals and electromagnetic pollution.
[00:22:53.167 --> 00:22:58.448]  You are now the cool club because you are one of 200 plus different things now.
[00:22:58.448 --> 00:23:00.949]  It was 50 something a couple years ago.
[00:23:02.256 --> 00:23:12.339]  And then when these miserable people are unhappy on all these hormones and chemicals and drugs, they say the reason you're committing suicide is you've not been loved and celebrated.
[00:23:12.339 --> 00:23:18.841]  The reason as sex workers you're getting shot and killed is because conservatives didn't embrace you.
[00:23:18.841 --> 00:23:21.602]  And so they're out there violently attacking people every day.
[00:23:21.602 --> 00:23:24.203]  I see videos killing, stabbing, beating.
[00:23:24.203 --> 00:23:25.784]  I've got a whole bunch of them today.
[00:23:25.784 --> 00:23:28.104]  And they're like, you're attacking us!
[00:23:28.104 --> 00:23:29.945]  As they break a bottle over somebody's head.
[00:23:31.823 --> 00:23:38.926]  So that's why I don't even hate these people, because I'm very sad for them.
[00:23:38.926 --> 00:23:42.708]  They are crazed, brainwashed maniacs.
[00:23:42.708 --> 00:23:49.431]  So, this clip is 12, 13 years old we're about to play.
[00:23:49.431 --> 00:24:01.136]  And I remember right before I saw this news piece, and I forget the name of it, there was a documentary of South by Southwest, back when I really did have a lot of interesting films to watch, and I went and saw it, and it was about gay men's fetish,
[00:24:02.739 --> 00:24:03.219]  We're good to go.
[00:24:22.779 --> 00:24:26.342]  It usually starts with a finger, but you're not really cool until you start cutting arms and legs off.
[00:24:26.342 --> 00:24:29.865]  And the coolest people have their arms and legs cut off.
[00:24:29.865 --> 00:24:33.969]  Back when this documentary was made, there were thousands of nuggets in Mexico.
[00:24:33.969 --> 00:24:36.311]  Thousands in the U.S.
[00:24:36.311 --> 00:24:39.874]  People can laugh at this, it's not, you ought to cry.
[00:24:39.874 --> 00:24:43.778]  So it's taking mental illness, it's celebrating a form of human sacrifice piece by piece.
[00:24:45.959 --> 00:25:10.066]  And then in the UK and the US and in the Netherlands and in Germany and in France, starting about 20 years ago, psychologists and psychiatrists would come because someone felt like they were blind and we should go along with your mental illness and we should help you pour Drano in your eyes and burn the surface of your eye off so all you see is gray.
[00:25:10.066 --> 00:25:14.807]  And I have countless reports, countless articles that are like, should we be doing this?
[00:25:15.695 --> 00:25:16.175]  I don't know.
[00:25:16.175 --> 00:25:19.456]  Should you be promoting pedophilia to five-year-olds?
[00:25:19.456 --> 00:25:20.716]  There's no end to it.
[00:25:20.716 --> 00:25:24.957]  It's the authority figures promoting absolute, pure, total evil.
[00:25:24.957 --> 00:25:30.798]  So I'm going to show you MMA fighters breaking women's skulls and jaws.
[00:25:30.798 --> 00:25:32.439]  They say that's loving.
[00:25:32.439 --> 00:25:35.920]  Men dominating golf, swimming, cycling.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.860]  Every women's sports now, it's all men winning.
[00:25:40.708 --> 00:25:48.673]  But is that anything compared to brainwashing autistic children that really love their sex so you can cut their sexual organs out of them?
[00:25:48.673 --> 00:26:06.104]  This is beyond Joseph Mingala on a mass scale and we're so politically intimidated to not want to talk about this and to not want to discuss this that we just let them do whatever they want.
[00:26:06.104 --> 00:26:07.425]  So now it's euthanasia.
[00:26:10.523 --> 00:26:19.151]  Now it's state-sponsored killing where they basically force you to kill yourself or the state's your ward and it decides to kill you in Canada and other places.
[00:26:19.151 --> 00:26:22.694]  The bottom has fallen out.
[00:26:22.694 --> 00:26:35.767]  And this is all being done because as we become more poisoned, as we live less and less, as we become more infertile, this dystopia is going to be celebrated.
[00:26:38.103 --> 00:26:40.184]  People that kill themselves are being celebrated.
[00:26:40.184 --> 00:26:42.606]  People that sterilize themselves are being celebrated.
[00:26:42.606 --> 00:26:46.509]  And they're targeting our children and then the schools aren't telling the parents.
[00:26:46.509 --> 00:26:48.590]  That's on record worldwide.
[00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:50.592]  Wherever the global corporations are in charge.
[00:26:50.592 --> 00:26:52.033]  This is their evil plan.
[00:26:52.033 --> 00:26:55.895]  To depopulate us from a world they've taken control of through fraud.
[00:26:55.895 --> 00:27:01.119]  They see us as cockroaches that broke into the pantry and are eating their food.
[00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:06.483]  Let's play a few minutes of a young woman having Drano dumped in her eyes and how beautiful it is.
[00:27:08.897 --> 00:27:12.358]  I felt imprisoned by my sight.
[00:27:12.358 --> 00:27:17.879]  I really felt the need to be blind.
[00:27:17.879 --> 00:27:23.000]  People believe that blindness is a disability.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.741]  I think of being empowered and being free when I think of being blind.
[00:27:29.741 --> 00:27:33.762]  I met a psychologist on the online group that I was a part of.
[00:27:34.202 --> 00:27:38.925]  I started telling him that I wanted to go blind permanently.
[00:27:38.925 --> 00:27:45.768]  He told me to do the research to show that I was serious, and then he would help me.
[00:27:45.768 --> 00:27:52.212]  I put all my time and effort into researching how to go blind.
[00:27:52.212 --> 00:28:00.517]  You find this psychologist in a chat room.
[00:28:00.517 --> 00:28:01.037]  In a...
[00:28:01.994 --> 00:28:05.857]  Online message board.
[00:28:05.857 --> 00:28:09.840]  I was having trouble coping with the need to go blind.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:15.985]  But there came a point where you decided to go see him.
[00:28:15.985 --> 00:28:22.270]  I spent the two weeks and then the third week we did the procedure.
[00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.651]  You say you didn't check this person out at all?
[00:28:24.651 --> 00:28:25.372]  I didn't.
[00:28:25.372 --> 00:28:26.793]  I trusted him.
[00:28:26.793 --> 00:28:28.895]  And then tell me how this worked.
[00:28:28.895 --> 00:28:29.715]  Did you lie down?
[00:28:31.115 --> 00:28:44.778]  I lied down on his couch, and he sat next to me, and after the numbing drops took effect, he put two drops of the drink cleaner in each eye.
[00:28:44.778 --> 00:28:45.558]  How did it feel?
[00:28:45.558 --> 00:28:46.598]  Let's stop here.
[00:28:46.598 --> 00:28:53.099]  By the way, there's actual footage of her doing it, but the point is, this is 12, 13 years ago, it seems crazy.
[00:28:53.099 --> 00:28:55.800]  Today, they're not saying it's good.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.520]  See how that works?
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.040]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:59.793 --> 00:29:03.415]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:29:03.415 --> 00:29:11.259]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[00:29:11.259 --> 00:29:14.820]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.742]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:29:17.742 --> 00:29:23.685]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down, Alex Jones was right.
[00:29:24.365 --> 00:29:27.887]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:29:27.887 --> 00:29:31.609]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:29:31.609 --> 00:29:34.491]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:29:34.491 --> 00:29:35.511]  Years ago.
[00:29:35.511 --> 00:29:37.612]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[00:29:37.612 --> 00:29:39.593]  Not for a second.
[00:29:39.593 --> 00:29:42.115]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:29:42.115 --> 00:29:44.576]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:29:44.576 --> 00:29:47.697]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:29:47.697 --> 00:29:52.360]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:30:01.024 --> 00:30:04.146]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:30:04.146 --> 00:30:06.447]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:30:06.447 --> 00:30:10.389]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:19.334]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:30:19.334 --> 00:30:26.217]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroeder and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[00:30:26.217 --> 00:30:27.098]  It's really just incredible.
[00:30:28.132 --> 00:30:31.014]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:30:31.014 --> 00:30:37.560]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.602]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:30:40.602 --> 00:30:49.530]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:53.113]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:53.813 --> 00:30:58.779]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:30:58.779 --> 00:31:00.701]  Please take action now.
[00:31:00.701 --> 00:31:08.890]  I intend to take the InfoWars armored truck out, or the InfoWars tank as it's so lovingly called.
[00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:13.355]  You came through yesterday and shopped at InfoWarsTore.com, so I'm going to be able to take the truck out.
[00:32:00.168 --> 00:32:08.370]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:09.830]  That is the hellish future.
[00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:19.232]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarshore.com.
[00:32:19.232 --> 00:32:24.833]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:32:24.833 --> 00:32:26.793]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:32:27.393 --> 00:32:32.780]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHore.com.
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:36.725]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:32:36.725 --> 00:32:42.633]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:32:42.633 --> 00:32:44.715]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[00:32:45.476 --> 00:32:46.496]  Or unsigned copies.
[00:32:46.496 --> 00:32:56.880]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWareStore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.960]  This is an InfoWare.
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.542]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[00:33:01.542 --> 00:33:06.143]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:06.143 --> 00:33:07.444]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:12.473 --> 00:33:24.361]  They're normalizing mass death, mass mental illness.
[00:33:24.361 --> 00:33:29.525]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.514 --> 00:33:41.062]  Alright, let me really now try to accelerate through the stack because I have about 15 different clips here.
[00:33:41.062 --> 00:33:47.830]  I just showed you part of one clip of a woman who's trans-abled and had Drano dumped in her eyes by a psychologist.
[00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:49.933]  Now, what's interesting is...
[00:33:51.721 --> 00:34:06.391]  That's a few years after she went on British TV and said how much she loved being blind and how great it was, and the psychologist went on the show and reapplied it because her eyes had healed some, so we wanted to make sure she was completely blind.
[00:34:06.391 --> 00:34:13.255]  Once she talked to Dr. Phil and he got her on, she kind of decided she'd been set up and it was wrong.
[00:34:13.255 --> 00:34:18.819]  Wow, you had a nice person that didn't lead you over an edge of a cliff who helped you understand you were wrong.
[00:34:20.333 --> 00:34:29.361]  But imagine small children being led by this death cult of transhumanists that want to see what they can get away with and they get off on it.
[00:34:29.361 --> 00:34:31.022]  And that's what she later learned.
[00:34:31.022 --> 00:34:42.232]  The person got off on abusing people and having them sign the forms because of free association to do it as an adult.
[00:34:42.232 --> 00:34:43.533]  And that's what happens
[00:34:45.814 --> 00:34:49.476]  With the children in the schools when they keep this information away from the parents.
[00:34:49.476 --> 00:34:55.240]  And this trans-abled movement is very, very big.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.201]  So that's an update on her story.
[00:34:57.201 --> 00:35:02.724]  We ought to try to get that lady on and see if she's fully woken up yet.
[00:35:02.724 --> 00:35:10.649]  So they abuse these people and then tell them you're not happy because the world hasn't accepted you.
[00:35:10.649 --> 00:35:12.510]  So when you see these other movements,
[00:35:16.909 --> 00:35:19.030]  Which they call trans age.
[00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:22.791]  I told you about this 20 years ago and I'm going to give you the rest of the story.
[00:35:22.791 --> 00:35:29.433]  All these articles are out there saying here's the new thing, tens of thousands are doing it in the U.S.
[00:35:29.433 --> 00:35:32.054]  alone, all over Europe.
[00:35:32.054 --> 00:35:40.697]  Welfare systems are paying for it, saying it's your right, we must pay, just like sex changes, which aren't really sex changes, they're mutilations.
[00:35:40.697 --> 00:35:42.297]  They're barbarous crimes.
[00:35:42.297 --> 00:35:44.558]  We need to pay so you can live as a baby
[00:35:45.359 --> 00:35:48.901]  In a pen, and have people wipe your ass.
[00:35:48.901 --> 00:36:01.970]  You can also eat 400 Twinkies a week, and 100 pizzas, and 14 buckets of fried chicken, and 10 gallons of ice cream, and weigh 800 pounds.
[00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:04.732]  And we're going to wipe your ass.
[00:36:04.732 --> 00:36:09.495]  Maybe some people who got their asses wiped were babies, and the King of England, and the King of France.
[00:36:10.814 --> 00:36:13.977]  Yes, Queen Elizabeth did not abolish the Room of the Stool.
[00:36:13.977 --> 00:36:23.888]  When she wanted to, she had a special toilet where normally a deputy in the government, a top minister, would wipe their ass.
[00:36:23.888 --> 00:36:25.270]  Folks, you think I'm lying.
[00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:26.231]  I know I'm not.
[00:36:26.231 --> 00:36:27.532]  It doesn't sound real.
[00:36:27.532 --> 00:36:28.734]  I understand that.
[00:36:28.734 --> 00:36:31.697]  The point is, is that that's what's going on here.
[00:36:33.444 --> 00:36:48.067]  So concerns raised over raised over trans movement called trans age condition as social media accounts go viral.
[00:36:48.067 --> 00:36:50.308]  This has been going on for a while.
[00:36:50.308 --> 00:36:55.149]  Then we've got this woman that even talks like she's from Africa.
[00:36:55.149 --> 00:36:59.310]  And she's going to have surgeries to put black pigment into her face.
[00:37:02.737 --> 00:37:11.044]  And she's gone and in a stereotypical Aunt Jemima look and I've just gotten what?
[00:37:11.044 --> 00:37:13.145]  15X triple D quadruple D breast?
[00:37:13.145 --> 00:37:15.327]  I don't know what you call those.
[00:37:15.327 --> 00:37:28.337]  It's like the trans guy with the rubber breast look like two basketballs in his t-shirt running around the shop class.
[00:37:28.337 --> 00:37:30.559]  So that's that's where we are.
[00:37:33.191 --> 00:37:39.075]  Let's go ahead and play the clip of the 800-pound baby.
[00:37:39.075 --> 00:37:41.217]  Babies can't drink coffee.
[00:37:41.217 --> 00:37:45.700]  I have my juice.
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:45.960]  Yay!
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.581]  Heddy Manny is on!
[00:37:47.581 --> 00:37:49.443]  It's my favorite show.
[00:37:49.443 --> 00:37:53.385]  Yeah!
[00:37:53.385 --> 00:37:59.170]  I like coloring because it's just relaxing to color stuff, man.
[00:38:00.127 --> 00:38:03.826]  You don't really have to follow the rules because you can color it whatever you want.
[00:38:19.443 --> 00:38:26.428]  An adult baby is somebody who enjoys dressing up and acting like a baby.
[00:38:26.428 --> 00:38:34.394]  And it could be as young as, you know, you want to be a six month old or you can go up to two or three years old.
[00:38:34.394 --> 00:38:36.375]  It's whatever that feels right for you.
[00:38:36.375 --> 00:38:41.679]  I associate most with being two years old because I think it's the best of both worlds.
[00:38:42.239 --> 00:38:54.446]  You're young enough to still be able to use a crib and a bottle and diapers and all that stuff, but you're also still old enough that you can get around on your own and talk and tell people what you want.
[00:38:54.446 --> 00:38:56.907]  Ah, refreshing.
[00:38:56.907 --> 00:38:58.468]  You want a drink?
[00:38:58.468 --> 00:39:02.290]  Not very many adult babies get a chance to have... Alright, turn it off.
[00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:02.911]  ...new furniture.
[00:39:04.107 --> 00:39:06.568]  This is while tens of millions are starving to death every year.
[00:39:06.568 --> 00:39:08.870]  This is why giant wars are starting.
[00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:13.512]  And while veterans litter the streets committing suicide, not getting their benefits.
[00:39:13.512 --> 00:39:18.936]  But don't worry, he'll get his benefits because they want to normalize and push all of this.
[00:39:18.936 --> 00:39:24.319]  This is total weaponization.
[00:39:24.319 --> 00:39:25.740]  Now let's go to another lunatic.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:31.643]  This is a new clip of a white woman who now talks like she's from some African country that's made up.
[00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:41.853]  And is about to have surgeries to, I guess, have brown pigment tattooed over her entire body.
[00:39:41.853 --> 00:39:49.998]  And again, you're not a black person, you're not from Africa, you're not a baby, you're a 30-year-old giant lazy fat man.
[00:39:49.998 --> 00:39:58.843]  And if you're a man who cuts your testicles off, you're a man that cut his testicles off, you're not a woman, you don't have the chromosomes, you don't have a uterus.
[00:39:58.843 --> 00:40:00.004]  Do I hate you?
[00:40:00.004 --> 00:40:01.385]  No.
[00:40:01.385 --> 00:40:02.446]  Are you mentally ill?
[00:40:02.446 --> 00:40:02.926]  Hell yeah.
[00:40:08.925 --> 00:40:11.926]  Let's go to the next clip.
[00:40:11.926 --> 00:40:31.171]  The one controversial aspect here, because, you know, we interview people all the time who want to change their appearance, people who see their bodies as ongoing artwork, all well and good, that's absolutely fine, but you have stepped into the realms of controversy by saying that you now identify as black.
[00:40:31.171 --> 00:40:32.652]  Now, what do you mean by that?
[00:40:34.289 --> 00:40:42.231]  Yeah, not only my whole body, not only the appearance changed, also my feelings and my, um, beauty idols.
[00:40:42.231 --> 00:40:49.733]  I understand that people will, obviously, they're going to react, but it's the fact that you say you identify as black.
[00:40:49.733 --> 00:40:51.853]  I don't want to fight the black people.
[00:40:51.853 --> 00:40:52.853]  I do it for myself.
[00:40:52.853 --> 00:40:54.894]  It is not a media attention.
[00:40:54.894 --> 00:40:57.815]  I'm just, um... Mother, hit pause.
[00:40:57.815 --> 00:41:02.776]  What do you see with this woman and the fat baby and the Drano lady?
[00:41:02.776 --> 00:41:03.696]  Mentally ill clowns.
[00:41:05.885 --> 00:41:07.646]  Now what do you see with the trans men?
[00:41:07.646 --> 00:41:11.048]  They don't really look like a woman, 99% of them.
[00:41:11.048 --> 00:41:17.951]  They're obese, they're horrific looking, they are dressed like clowns, and they're saying, we're coming for your children.
[00:41:17.951 --> 00:41:23.715]  And that's the last key part on the trans age movement.
[00:41:23.715 --> 00:41:31.479]  The left is saying that children can identify as adults, adults, and have sex with adults.
[00:41:32.304 --> 00:41:38.565]  And that they have their own rights to take an experimental shot, to take drugs, to drink alcohol.
[00:41:38.565 --> 00:41:44.986]  Can't join the military, can't get a gun, can't drink alcohol, but you can because you identify.
[00:41:44.986 --> 00:41:47.247]  This is all pedophilic.
[00:41:47.247 --> 00:41:49.307]  It's all about confusing the natural order.
[00:41:49.307 --> 00:41:56.388]  It's all about sabotaging society.
[00:41:56.388 --> 00:42:01.389]  And they've been promised access to our children because they are under demonic control.
[00:42:02.665 --> 00:42:07.287]  And they want access.
[00:42:07.287 --> 00:42:11.348]  Oh, they're committing suicide because no one's worshipping them.
[00:42:11.348 --> 00:42:18.271]  So bring your children like you bring it to the statue of Moloch and throw your child in the fires of this destructive lifestyle.
[00:42:18.271 --> 00:42:19.792]  And it's all a detailed plan.
[00:42:19.792 --> 00:42:22.713]  We come back.
[00:42:22.713 --> 00:42:23.253]  We've got more.
[00:42:27.677 --> 00:42:39.563]  Two weeks after the mass shooter killed a bunch of children and adults at a school in Tennessee, the left is everywhere, including the White House Press Secretary, saying they're going to get violent.
[00:42:39.563 --> 00:42:42.385]  And they're storming capitals.
[00:42:42.385 --> 00:42:47.127]  Because we're not going to give them access to our children unfettered.
[00:42:47.127 --> 00:42:49.908]  They can't abort them in the womb, they're going to abort them outside.
[00:42:49.908 --> 00:42:52.710]  With a toxic culture.
[00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:54.191]  This is the enemy's main attack.
[00:42:54.191 --> 00:42:54.671]  Stay with us.
[00:43:00.413 --> 00:43:06.643]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:15.992]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for President 2024 shirt.
[00:43:15.992 --> 00:43:18.393]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[00:43:18.393 --> 00:43:19.714]  This is an idea the crew had.
[00:43:19.714 --> 00:43:22.375]  To have a triggering shirt, kind of next level.
[00:43:22.375 --> 00:43:23.636]  Alex Jones is right.
[00:43:23.636 --> 00:43:27.998]  There's Infowars.com on the back, Alex Jones for President 2024 on the front.
[00:43:27.998 --> 00:43:29.038]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:43:29.038 --> 00:43:30.299]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[00:43:30.299 --> 00:43:31.640]  It's high quality.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.041]  And it is a exclusive shirt to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:35.041 --> 00:43:36.902]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[00:43:36.902 --> 00:43:38.003]  We're doing one run.
[00:43:38.983 --> 00:43:49.690]  Of Alex Jones for President, 2024 shirts, and we'll have a historic memento, be able to spread the word, meet a lot of like-minded people, and you'll be able to keep us on the air.
[00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:50.811]  No way.
[00:43:50.811 --> 00:43:51.091]  No way.
[00:43:51.091 --> 00:43:52.392]  That's a bridge too far.
[00:43:52.392 --> 00:43:54.133]  That's no, it can't be.
[00:43:54.133 --> 00:43:56.855]  And I said on national television that he was gonna win.
[00:43:56.855 --> 00:44:00.557]  At InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:44:00.557 --> 00:44:01.938]  InfoWars.
[00:44:01.938 --> 00:44:03.119]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:44:03.119 --> 00:44:03.959]  Today.
[00:44:03.959 --> 00:44:04.780]  This is their big move.
[00:44:05.706 --> 00:44:09.510]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:11.212]  He doesn't care.
[00:44:11.212 --> 00:44:12.453]  That's not his job.
[00:44:12.453 --> 00:44:14.215]  He's not the president of the United States.
[00:44:14.215 --> 00:44:18.079]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[00:44:18.079 --> 00:44:22.584]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[00:44:22.584 --> 00:44:23.685]  They must be opposed.
[00:44:24.438 --> 00:44:27.720]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:28.901]  No.
[00:44:28.901 --> 00:44:29.741]  No.
[00:44:29.741 --> 00:44:30.522]  No.
[00:44:30.522 --> 00:44:31.402]  Exactly.
[00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:34.964]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[00:44:34.964 --> 00:44:38.066]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[00:44:38.066 --> 00:44:40.548]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[00:44:40.548 --> 00:44:43.049]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[00:44:43.049 --> 00:44:46.671]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[00:44:46.671 --> 00:44:49.193]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[00:44:49.193 --> 00:44:49.593]  You're right.
[00:44:49.873 --> 00:44:54.634]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[00:44:54.634 --> 00:44:56.175]  And we say no to your war!
[00:45:16.121 --> 00:45:18.923]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[00:45:18.923 --> 00:45:20.644]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[00:45:20.644 --> 00:45:23.165]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[00:45:23.165 --> 00:45:27.528]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[00:45:27.528 --> 00:45:33.231]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[00:45:33.231 --> 00:45:38.214]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[00:45:38.214 --> 00:45:41.296]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the
[00:45:41.596 --> 00:45:43.417]  I intend to take the InfoWars
[00:46:04.853 --> 00:46:08.362]  Armored truck out, or the InfoWars tank as it's so lovingly called.
[00:46:08.362 --> 00:46:12.833]  You came through yesterday and shopped at InfoWarsStore.com so I'm gonna be able to take the truck out.
[00:47:01.181 --> 00:47:05.805]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:05.805 --> 00:47:23.862]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:23.862 --> 00:47:27.405]  If you notice, economy's falling apart, crime's exploding.
[00:47:29.121 --> 00:47:31.382]  They're not even denying it now.
[00:47:31.382 --> 00:47:32.502]  And they're just getting started.
[00:47:32.502 --> 00:47:37.625]  And the deeper you get in the New World Order, the worse things are gonna get.
[00:47:37.625 --> 00:47:45.928]  So at some point, all of you people out there pretending you're part of the system, are gonna have to make a decision which side you're on.
[00:47:45.928 --> 00:47:47.289]  The one of self-preservation?
[00:47:47.289 --> 00:47:49.469]  The one that empowers you?
[00:47:49.469 --> 00:47:52.971]  The one you were designed to be?
[00:47:52.971 --> 00:47:55.212]  The maker made you to be?
[00:47:58.994 --> 00:48:02.036]  Are you going to follow God's plan?
[00:48:02.036 --> 00:48:05.698]  Or are you going to follow Satan's plan?
[00:48:05.698 --> 00:48:07.359]  Reach out to God.
[00:48:07.359 --> 00:48:10.781]  Say, God, show me how real you are.
[00:48:10.781 --> 00:48:12.863]  I open the door to the Holy Spirit.
[00:48:12.863 --> 00:48:13.503]  Save me.
[00:48:13.503 --> 00:48:15.404]  In the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.863]  You have to make the decision.
[00:48:35.863 --> 00:48:38.365]  Please join us now.
[00:48:38.365 --> 00:48:41.627]  Please make the decision.
[00:48:41.627 --> 00:48:46.671]  Only you can make it.
[00:48:46.671 --> 00:48:55.017]  So you can pull up the unified FBI crime statistics and trans people in the United States
[00:48:56.138 --> 00:49:02.260]  At the highest rate of suicide, the highest rate of HIV, the highest rate of being murdered.
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:07.782]  And when you look at the statistics and drill in, it is that over half of them are sex workers.
[00:49:07.782 --> 00:49:09.443]  What population is half sex workers?
[00:49:09.443 --> 00:49:10.984]  Nobody.
[00:49:10.984 --> 00:49:15.285]  That's what they're put into by the system.
[00:49:15.285 --> 00:49:22.408]  They are under psychiatric care more than any other group, where they're fostering their mental illness and super turbocharging it.
[00:49:23.601 --> 00:49:28.925]  And they are in super abusive, destructive societies.
[00:49:28.925 --> 00:49:42.754]  I have nothing against homosexuals, but no one can lie, historically, about the statistics of how destructive that lifestyle is for someone that is in the middle of that lifestyle.
[00:49:42.754 --> 00:49:47.338]  And how alone those people are, and how shallow it all is.
[00:49:48.789 --> 00:49:50.949]  And it's not about hating those people.
[00:49:50.949 --> 00:50:04.792]  It's saying, if you thought the gay lifestyle was destructive, can you imagine what it's like for someone put into this at age 5 or 6, whose genitals are gone by 10 or 11, and they are whacked out of their brain on all sorts of drugs and puberty blockers?
[00:50:04.792 --> 00:50:06.932]  My gosh!
[00:50:06.932 --> 00:50:08.933]  You've ever been around a menopausal woman?
[00:50:08.933 --> 00:50:15.354]  The reports are, these people going through transitions, it's 5 to 10 times worse than menopause.
[00:50:19.491 --> 00:50:21.513]  And that's male to female.
[00:50:21.513 --> 00:50:26.577]  Female to male is incredibly destructive.
[00:50:26.577 --> 00:50:28.438]  Anybody knows about female bodybuilders.
[00:50:28.438 --> 00:50:30.560]  They've got Netflix shows about it, you name it.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.501]  They are beating the hell out of their family.
[00:50:32.501 --> 00:50:33.962]  They're murdering their husbands.
[00:50:33.962 --> 00:50:36.865]  They are just psychotic as hell.
[00:50:36.865 --> 00:50:41.488]  Because they're taking ten times the testosterone that a man would have.
[00:50:41.488 --> 00:50:45.752]  And then you wonder why they've got such a high statistical rate of ended up in prison.
[00:50:46.912 --> 00:50:52.073]  Women aren't supposed to be taking ten times the hormones a man's got.
[00:50:52.073 --> 00:50:54.233]  Men aren't supposed to be taking women's hormones.
[00:50:54.233 --> 00:50:57.134]  It's incredibly destructive.
[00:50:57.134 --> 00:51:01.214]  We know this.
[00:51:01.214 --> 00:51:09.996]  The entire family of serotonin reuptake inhibitors has had warnings on it since the early nineties.
[00:51:09.996 --> 00:51:12.176]  Massive increase in suicide.
[00:51:12.176 --> 00:51:14.397]  Massive increase in psychotic breaks.
[00:51:14.397 --> 00:51:15.057]  Incredible
[00:51:16.238 --> 00:51:22.040]  Increase in megalomania, delusions of grandeur, and murder.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:25.662]  Suicide.
[00:51:25.662 --> 00:51:30.923]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:30.923 --> 00:51:35.305]  I've probably only taken Adderall 20 times in my life.
[00:51:35.305 --> 00:51:42.628]  And the first few times I'd be at rallies or events like 10 years ago, and tired, and I'd be around military people, and they'd say, take half of one of these.
[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:46.602]  And boy, I feel so horrible the next day.
[00:51:46.602 --> 00:51:51.064]  But I mean, the few times I've taken Adderall, I want to kill people.
[00:51:51.064 --> 00:52:09.654]  And then I learned what the general public, that the regular dose, I was taking a quarter dose the times I did it, that people that are prescribed it take, that children take.
[00:52:09.654 --> 00:52:12.095]  I've taken methamphetamine two or three times in high school.
[00:52:13.703 --> 00:52:15.885]  And the Adderall was about half as strong as that.
[00:52:15.885 --> 00:52:17.126]  It's the same thing.
[00:52:17.126 --> 00:52:22.051]  And when I, a few times, took methamphetamine, snorted it, I wanted to kill people.
[00:52:22.051 --> 00:52:29.458]  I didn't want to go out and immediately do it, but I mean, I was like... I mean, imagine the people that are on this stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:30.816 --> 00:52:33.598]  And then we wonder why they go to school and kill a bunch of people.
[00:52:33.598 --> 00:52:41.263]  And the psychologists and the psychiatrists and the systems that develop this know exactly what they're doing to bring down society.
[00:52:41.263 --> 00:52:43.084]  To bring in their new world order.
[00:52:43.084 --> 00:52:49.308]  They know when they get online and bring a young woman and it wants to be blinded that they're getting off on that.
[00:52:49.308 --> 00:52:54.031]  Not the woman, these psychos.
[00:52:54.031 --> 00:52:58.434]  So, and the reason I, you know, tell those stories is it's all the cards are on the table, folks.
[00:52:59.718 --> 00:53:10.426]  That I'm not just telling you what I've read about this stuff, I don't know how anybody can take it!
[00:53:10.426 --> 00:53:15.469]  So, that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:15.469 --> 00:53:19.252]  And that's where this society has gone.
[00:53:19.252 --> 00:53:20.653]  And it's a plan.
[00:53:20.653 --> 00:53:24.976]  Now here is the Press Secretary saying the LBJ
[00:53:25.982 --> 00:53:33.929]  G-T-Q-X-Y-Z kids are resilient, they are fierce, and they fight back.
[00:53:33.929 --> 00:53:35.911]  You mean not letting anybody have a speech?
[00:53:35.911 --> 00:53:36.932]  You mean shooting people?
[00:53:36.932 --> 00:53:38.113]  Shooting little kids?
[00:53:38.113 --> 00:53:39.894]  Yeah, they sure as hell fight back.
[00:53:39.894 --> 00:53:40.855]  Killing nine-year-olds?
[00:53:40.855 --> 00:53:41.736]  Blowing their heads off?
[00:53:41.736 --> 00:53:44.138]  Yeah, man, none of them apologized.
[00:53:44.138 --> 00:53:45.860]  None of the left said violence is wrong.
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:50.644]  None of them said it was all, well, you shouldn't have messed with him, who was a her.
[00:53:52.881 --> 00:54:00.124]  So they can push their terrorism, they can push their violence, and then turn around and call us terrorists.
[00:54:00.124 --> 00:54:01.885]  Here is another clown.
[00:54:01.885 --> 00:54:17.573]  More than 50% of transgender youth in the U.S., which is estimated to be more than 150,000 kids, live in states in which transgender youth have lost access to, or at risk of losing access to, gender-affirming care.
[00:54:17.573 --> 00:54:18.793]  Look, this is awful news.
[00:54:18.793 --> 00:54:20.394]  Let's be very clear about that.
[00:54:22.026 --> 00:54:26.728]  LGBTQI plus kids are resilient.
[00:54:26.728 --> 00:54:27.988]  They are fierce.
[00:54:27.988 --> 00:54:29.348]  They fight back.
[00:54:29.348 --> 00:54:32.149]  They're not going anywhere.
[00:54:32.149 --> 00:54:33.890]  And we have their back.
[00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:37.691]  This administration has their back.
[00:54:37.691 --> 00:54:38.511]  Yeah, we know.
[00:54:38.511 --> 00:54:44.053]  You wouldn't decry one of your people that killed all those kids.
[00:54:44.053 --> 00:54:47.314]  By the way, I have not gotten one third into the stack.
[00:54:48.558 --> 00:54:52.641]  But I'm going to continue next hour with all of this.
[00:54:52.641 --> 00:54:54.062]  Effing bitch.
[00:54:54.062 --> 00:55:02.870]  Former NCAA champion swimmer Riley Gaines assaulted by a mob of people that wouldn't let her speak in San Francisco University.
[00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:13.478]  Then they followed her to her hotel and started breaking down the door and attacking her and the police wouldn't help.
[00:55:13.478 --> 00:55:15.460]  Or the dorm they had for her to be at the university.
[00:55:17.409 --> 00:55:21.850]  And it goes on and on and on and on.
[00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:26.911]  A bunch of other clips of school boards admitting they're keeping it secret from the parents what they're doing.
[00:55:26.911 --> 00:55:28.491]  Yeah, that's what pedos do.
[00:55:28.491 --> 00:55:34.972]  And then leftist trans people all over the internet, look at this clip, saying we want to kill J.K.
[00:55:34.972 --> 00:55:39.053]  Rowling because she says biological women are biological women.
[00:55:39.053 --> 00:55:45.894]  And then you got the men in the MMA breaking women's jaws, creating sub...
[00:55:47.059 --> 00:55:49.240]  Dermal hematomas.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:51.261]  Look at this.
[00:55:51.261 --> 00:55:53.183]  Beating up biological women.
[00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:56.805]  And it's like, oh, now when a man beats up a woman, it's liberal.
[00:55:56.805 --> 00:55:58.005]  It's trendy.
[00:55:58.005 --> 00:55:59.106]  But don't worry.
[00:55:59.106 --> 00:56:01.888]  The new movement is saying they're babies.
[00:56:01.888 --> 00:56:06.190]  And that the children can be adults and then have sex with the babies.
[00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:09.472]  That's not something out of a Rob Zombie horror movie.
[00:56:09.472 --> 00:56:11.773]  No, that's the future.
[00:56:11.773 --> 00:56:12.834]  That's the future.
[00:56:14.622 --> 00:56:19.327]  Trans activists now claim age is a social construct just like we predicted would happen.
[00:56:19.327 --> 00:56:23.011]  They say it's for children as well.
[00:56:23.011 --> 00:56:27.816]  You finally become a left-winger.
[00:56:27.816 --> 00:56:35.524]  And the CMA Awards and Budweiser and Jack Daniels all say woman of the year is a man.
[00:56:37.691 --> 00:56:38.732]  It's all weaponized.
[00:56:38.732 --> 00:56:41.614]  They're all kamikaze operations to bring down civilization.
[00:56:41.614 --> 00:56:43.356]  It's all part of a larger plan.
[00:56:43.356 --> 00:56:47.439]  Recognize it for what it is from the establishment against the people.
[00:56:47.439 --> 00:56:48.260]  We're going to go to break.
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:51.222]  Don't forget we've got two limited edition t-shirts out right now.
[00:56:51.222 --> 00:56:53.604]  And when they're gone, they're gone.
[00:56:53.604 --> 00:57:00.490]  Alex Jones for President shirt and Trump political prisoner mugshot shirt are both excellent shirts.
[00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:04.153]  We just got in the new shipment of Alex Jones for President.
[00:57:04.153 --> 00:57:05.434]  We sold out of the first shipment.
[00:57:06.209 --> 00:57:07.230]  But BAM!
[00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:08.171]  Made right here in Texas.
[00:57:08.171 --> 00:57:09.132]  Got them in within a week.
[00:57:09.132 --> 00:57:10.853]  So those are shipping out right now.
[00:57:10.853 --> 00:57:13.275]  It'll take another week or so because they're making them right now.
[00:57:13.275 --> 00:57:17.900]  The Mugshot Trump T-shirts with Infowars.com on the back.
[00:57:19.141 --> 00:57:23.723]  So get your order in now, in pre-order, and it will ship out to you very, very quickly.
[00:57:23.723 --> 00:57:27.205]  And it is a fundraiser shirt, so I appreciate your support.
[00:57:27.205 --> 00:57:29.226]  Man, a really nice, high-quality fabric.
[00:57:29.226 --> 00:57:31.667]  You know, these shirts we make, they're out of high-quality fabric.
[00:57:31.667 --> 00:57:33.207]  I wear it hundreds of times.
[00:57:33.207 --> 00:57:34.388]  Don't disintegrate.
[00:57:34.388 --> 00:57:38.410]  The cheap t-shirts out there that are the same price fall apart after you wash them three times.
[00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:39.850]  These are high-quality.
[00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:40.871]  InfowarStore.com.
[00:57:40.871 --> 00:57:42.592]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:57:42.592 --> 00:57:44.152]  And DNA Force Plus is selling out.
[00:57:44.152 --> 00:57:45.013]  Despite that, still 40% off.
[00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:53.101]  Most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[00:57:57.864 --> 00:57:59.205]  I want you all to know something.
[00:57:59.205 --> 00:58:01.167]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:58:01.167 --> 00:58:04.709]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[00:58:04.709 --> 00:58:07.812]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:58:07.812 --> 00:58:12.075]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[00:58:12.075 --> 00:58:14.297]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:58:14.297 --> 00:58:17.819]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:58:17.819 --> 00:58:21.262]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:58:21.522 --> 00:58:24.403]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:58:24.403 --> 00:58:25.424]  Years ago.
[00:58:25.424 --> 00:58:29.506]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[00:58:29.506 --> 00:58:32.027]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:58:32.027 --> 00:58:34.488]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:58:34.488 --> 00:58:37.610]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:58:37.610 --> 00:58:42.272]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:58:51.548 --> 00:59:01.259]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[00:59:01.259 --> 00:59:04.944]  We can't stay on air without your help, and I want to thank you all for your past support.
[00:59:04.944 --> 00:59:11.892]  And I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products at InfoWarsTore.com to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[00:59:12.412 --> 00:59:16.675]  Ultimate Bone Broth, finally sold out for over two years, back in stock.

[00:59:19.417 --> 00:59:21.679]  Nitric, boosts what it does for your heart.
[00:59:21.679 --> 00:59:23.420]  Cardiovascular, critical.
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:31.466]  All these products, like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Supermelt Vitality, they're all available and in stock, ready to ship to you, right down at infowarestore.com.
[00:59:31.466 --> 00:59:40.392]  And the final 1,200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, and I'm not gonna sign anymore after that, are exclusively available at infowarestore.com as well.
[00:59:40.592 --> 00:59:43.015]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[00:59:43.015 --> 00:59:43.916]  We didn't have them for sale.
[00:59:43.916 --> 00:59:45.457]  But now, I signed the last books.
[00:59:45.457 --> 00:59:51.284]  You can get them right now.
[00:59:51.284 --> 00:59:57.191]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:07.688 --> 01:00:21.073]  We're continuing to break down the globalist power grab, take away parental rights on every front, and promote the sterilization and the mutilation of our children.
[01:00:21.073 --> 01:00:34.498]  And there's an important video by Jordan Henry, who was at the Glendale Unified School District and was being shut down by the school board when he was simply exposing what the superintendent said publicly about putting
[01:00:35.177 --> 01:00:38.481]  Girls in boys showers.
[01:00:38.481 --> 01:00:39.723]  Here is the video.
[01:00:40.947 --> 01:00:44.210]  Thank you for letting me speak here today.
[01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:46.672]  I'm here to talk as a parent.
[01:00:46.672 --> 01:00:48.794]  I've got two young boys.
[01:00:48.794 --> 01:00:50.495]  We live in Glendale.
[01:00:50.495 --> 01:00:57.261]  And when they come of age, I am deeply concerned about their educational prospects in this city.
[01:00:57.261 --> 01:00:58.702]  I'm also a taxpayer.
[01:00:58.702 --> 01:01:02.826]  I pay a lot of taxes in this city, many of which go to this district.
[01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:05.888]  And I'm deeply concerned about how that money is being spent, particularly
[01:01:06.983 --> 01:01:15.487]  I'm going to single out a person in the school district named Dr. Kelly King, who's sitting right here to my left.
[01:01:15.487 --> 01:01:19.469]  Dr. Kelly King makes over $250,000 a year.
[01:01:19.469 --> 01:01:22.051]  Every four years we give her a million dollars.
[01:01:22.051 --> 01:01:28.194]  We'll be paying for her pension for the duration of her life after she retires.
[01:01:28.194 --> 01:01:34.097]  And she's doing things that I completely disagree with, and I think many members of the community would also disagree with.
[01:01:35.267 --> 01:01:40.450]  Previous speakers have mentioned the number of Armenians who live in Glendale.
[01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:42.552]  How many Armenians would support what she does?
[01:01:42.552 --> 01:01:45.373]  Let me discuss what she's doing.
[01:01:45.373 --> 01:02:01.884]  In a recent video in 2017, she reflected Glendale Unified Policy when she stated, and I'm going to quote, we have a lot of resistance from male coaches who are horrified at the thought of having a biological girl
[01:02:03.672 --> 01:02:07.034]  Changing clothes in front of them.
[01:02:07.034 --> 01:02:11.497]  Which biological girls are changing clothes in front of coaches in Glendale Unified?
[01:02:11.497 --> 01:02:14.019]  That's a question I'm genuinely asking.
[01:02:14.019 --> 01:02:16.900]  She continued, It's not a girl.
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.401]  It's not a girl.
[01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:20.343]  It's not a girl.
[01:02:20.343 --> 01:02:22.784]  You only have boys in the boys' locker room.
[01:02:24.205 --> 01:02:25.767]  She just said it was a biological girl.
[01:02:25.767 --> 01:02:27.969]  Can I just stop for a moment?
[01:02:27.969 --> 01:02:28.630]  No, I'm speaking.
[01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:30.171]  This is interrupting my time.
[01:02:30.171 --> 01:02:31.853]  Well, we can pause the time.
[01:02:31.853 --> 01:02:33.254]  Can you pause the time for a minute?
[01:02:33.254 --> 01:02:37.018]  I only wanted to say that to refrain from personal attacks.
[01:02:37.018 --> 01:02:38.739]  She is a government official.
[01:02:38.739 --> 01:02:39.760]  She's a government employee.
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.282]  This is not a personal attack.
[01:02:41.282 --> 01:02:42.363]  I pay her salary.
[01:02:43.934 --> 01:02:44.574]  With my tax dollars.
[01:02:44.574 --> 01:02:53.378]  So, again, please talk towards the policies that you are against and refrain from personal attacks and your time will continue.
[01:02:53.378 --> 01:02:54.278]  Please go ahead.
[01:02:54.278 --> 01:02:57.079]  In what way have I personally attacked Dr. King?
[01:02:57.079 --> 01:03:02.382]  She is acting within her official role as Assistant Superintendent at Glendale Unified.
[01:03:02.382 --> 01:03:04.062]  How is that a personal attack?
[01:03:04.062 --> 01:03:07.544]  I'm talking about tax dollars being used in a way that I disagree with.
[01:03:08.854 --> 01:03:09.815]  I'm going to continue.
[01:03:09.815 --> 01:03:12.416]  Continue talking about the policy that you disagree with.
[01:03:12.416 --> 01:03:25.024]  Dr. King quoted to say that biological girls were changing in front of male coaches and then so she knows it's a biological girl and then proceeded to say it's not a girl three times.
[01:03:25.024 --> 01:03:26.285]  You know it's a girl.
[01:03:26.285 --> 01:03:27.106]  You know it's a girl.
[01:03:27.106 --> 01:03:33.830]  Okay, so she's an employee of ours and if you wouldn't mind telling us what policy you dislike
[01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:44.497]  Why am I being interrupted for speaking about an official member of superintendent at Glendale Unified speaking in an official manner?
[01:03:44.497 --> 01:03:45.658]  You cannot interrupt me for that.
[01:03:45.658 --> 01:03:47.459]  You have no ability to do that.
[01:03:47.459 --> 01:03:50.681]  And furthermore, the rules stated you won't debate.
[01:03:50.681 --> 01:03:51.742]  You're debating me right now.
[01:03:53.646 --> 01:03:54.146]  Correct?
[01:03:54.146 --> 01:03:56.108]  I'm going to continue.
[01:03:56.108 --> 01:04:07.577]  In discussing permanent records, she states that she keeps permanent records for a handful of trans students literally next to her in her room.
[01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:15.524]  She does not indicate that person's gender identity for fear that the parent might find out.
[01:04:15.524 --> 01:04:17.705]  Why is she concealing this from parents?
[01:04:17.705 --> 01:04:18.086]  She says,
[01:04:19.198 --> 01:04:22.741]  We kind of go out on a limb, and we know that's controversial to some people.
[01:04:22.741 --> 01:04:24.062]  Which people?
[01:04:24.062 --> 01:04:24.723]  Which parents?
[01:04:24.723 --> 01:04:26.084]  Armenian parents?
[01:04:26.084 --> 01:04:27.365]  Christian parents?
[01:04:27.365 --> 01:04:32.030]  Tell you what, back to something about 30 seconds.
[01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:38.175]  Back in about 30 seconds, I want the part where, because we have the clip of the superintendent saying it on television.
[01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:39.797]  Then they say, you can't say what she said.
[01:04:41.528 --> 01:04:43.150]  And then it goes into the documents.
[01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:46.755]  They are keeping the secret from the parents.
[01:04:46.755 --> 01:04:48.657]  So there's this controversy even going on.
[01:04:48.657 --> 01:04:50.399]  It's called grooming.
[01:04:50.399 --> 01:04:53.163]  And they can form the sexual views of your child and their identity.
[01:04:53.163 --> 01:04:55.085]  They can dominate them for life.
[01:04:55.085 --> 01:04:56.227]  It's all scientifically run.
[01:05:00.134 --> 01:05:06.800]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.722]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:05:08.722 --> 01:05:10.243]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[01:05:10.243 --> 01:05:13.046]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:05:13.046 --> 01:05:15.047]  And it says political prisoner.
[01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:17.789]  With an image of President Trump.
[01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:20.230]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:22.370]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:28.973]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[01:05:28.973 --> 01:05:30.013]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:05:30.013 --> 01:05:34.134]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:05:34.134 --> 01:05:35.735]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[01:05:35.735 --> 01:05:36.755]  No, I'm not running for President.
[01:05:36.755 --> 01:05:39.316]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[01:05:39.316 --> 01:05:40.097]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:05:40.097 --> 01:05:40.977]  Alex Jones for President.
[01:05:41.677 --> 01:05:44.518]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[01:05:44.518 --> 01:05:46.399]  Great way to fund the operation.
[01:05:46.399 --> 01:05:55.664]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:06:16.582 --> 01:06:22.707]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:22.707 --> 01:06:44.403]  So not just in the United States, not just in Canada, not just in Europe, not just in Australia, not just in New Zealand, but everywhere globalist corporations are in control, they are keeping it from parents in elementary, middle school, and high school, that they've convinced the child in the role-playing games that we've showed you videos of, that they are a different sex or a different creature.
[01:06:45.063 --> 01:06:50.107]  First they go, oh, maybe you're a monkey, maybe you're a tiger, maybe you're an ostrich, maybe you're an eagle.
[01:06:50.107 --> 01:06:54.049]  And the next, maybe you're a boy, maybe you're a girl, maybe you're this, maybe you're that.
[01:06:54.049 --> 01:06:57.732]  Several hundred new designations.
[01:06:57.732 --> 01:07:04.937]  And so I already played a lot of this, some stations just joined us, but this is Glendale Schools out in, I guess, California.
[01:07:04.937 --> 01:07:07.739]  And the parent is sitting there talking to us, two sons.
[01:07:08.715 --> 01:07:09.035]  We're good to go.
[01:07:30.851 --> 01:07:33.732]  The school board head saying, you're not allowed to read those quotes.
[01:07:33.732 --> 01:07:38.033]  You're not allowed to talk about the superintendent in public statements the superintendent's made.
[01:07:38.033 --> 01:07:43.955]  We'll play those statements that you just read the text of, the transcript of, with video of her saying it.
[01:07:43.955 --> 01:07:49.297]  So since when have you watched a city council or county commission or school board where they cut you off?
[01:07:49.297 --> 01:07:51.358]  Well, they do it all the time now.
[01:07:51.358 --> 01:07:53.719]  Oh, you're not going to single out the superintendent.
[01:07:53.719 --> 01:07:55.319]  You can't talk about individuals.
[01:07:55.319 --> 01:07:57.140]  If there's a policy you don't like, tell us.
[01:07:58.336 --> 01:07:59.978]  So he goes, yeah, I don't like the policy.
[01:07:59.978 --> 01:08:02.402]  Well, guess what?
[01:08:02.402 --> 01:08:04.605]  We have the power and we set the policy.
[01:08:04.605 --> 01:08:10.753]  Ha ha, piss up a rope, jump in the lake, go fly a kite, play in traffic.
[01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:14.238]  And it's a unified criminal group.
[01:08:14.238 --> 01:08:15.921]  So let's finish up the clip.
[01:08:17.237 --> 01:08:18.458]  Jordan Henry, the father.
[01:08:18.458 --> 01:08:23.462]  Then we'll play Kelly King, the assistant superintendent in Glendale, California.
[01:08:23.462 --> 01:08:24.342]  Here it is.
[01:08:24.342 --> 01:08:31.588]  Dr. King quoted to say that biological girls were changing in front of male coaches.
[01:08:31.588 --> 01:08:36.971]  So she knows it's a biological girl, and then proceeded to say it's not a girl three times.
[01:08:36.971 --> 01:08:38.232]  You know it's a girl.
[01:08:38.232 --> 01:08:39.073]  You know it's a girl.
[01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:45.778]  She's an employee of ours, and if you wouldn't mind telling us what policy you dislike,
[01:08:46.658 --> 01:08:56.425]  Why am I being interrupted for speaking about an official member, a superintendent at Glendale Unified, speaking in an official manner?
[01:08:56.425 --> 01:08:57.586]  You cannot interrupt me for that.
[01:08:57.586 --> 01:08:59.387]  You have no ability to do that.
[01:08:59.387 --> 01:09:02.629]  And furthermore, the rules stated you won't debate.
[01:09:02.629 --> 01:09:03.690]  You're debating me right now.
[01:09:05.592 --> 01:09:06.072]  Correct?
[01:09:06.072 --> 01:09:08.054]  I'm going to continue.
[01:09:08.054 --> 01:09:19.525]  In discussing permanent records, she states that she keeps permanent records for a handful of trans students literally next to her in her room.
[01:09:19.525 --> 01:09:27.472]  She does not indicate that person's gender identity for fear that the parent might find out.
[01:09:27.472 --> 01:09:29.634]  Why is she concealing this from parents?
[01:09:29.634 --> 01:09:30.015]  She says,
[01:09:31.124 --> 01:09:34.687]  We kind of go out on a limb, and we know that's controversial to some people.
[01:09:34.687 --> 01:09:36.009]  Which people?
[01:09:36.009 --> 01:09:36.649]  Which parents?
[01:09:36.649 --> 01:09:38.011]  Armenian parents?
[01:09:38.011 --> 01:09:39.532]  Christian parents?
[01:09:39.532 --> 01:09:48.120]  Are those the ones who are being excluded from knowledge on their own children and their own identity in Glendale's Unified School District?
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:54.686]  And you preach inclusive policies, we can talk about that policy, yet she's excluding parents!
[01:09:55.527 --> 01:09:56.948]  He's excluding parents.
[01:09:56.948 --> 01:09:57.869]  I'm going to continue.
[01:09:57.869 --> 01:09:58.390]  I'm going to continue.
[01:09:58.390 --> 01:10:02.734]  And I might just ask for a pause and ask for information.
[01:10:02.734 --> 01:10:04.055]  Maybe I'm mistaken.
[01:10:04.055 --> 01:10:07.859]  Can you pause the time for a moment, Mr. Sahakian?
[01:10:07.859 --> 01:10:08.119]  Thanks.
[01:10:10.703 --> 01:10:28.731]  So I wouldn't mind getting input in terms of... So my understanding, again, is that we are the arbiters of policy, that is our decision, and so our employees are operating based off of our direction.
[01:10:28.731 --> 01:10:31.292]  So yeah, we're doing this, and we're in charge.
[01:10:31.292 --> 01:10:33.212]  Piss up a rope.
[01:10:33.212 --> 01:10:34.393]  So here's the clip.
[01:10:34.393 --> 01:10:36.434]  If you just joined us, I played most of it last segment.
[01:10:37.389 --> 01:10:47.756]  Where the superintendent of the Glendale Unified, I'm talking about middle school here particularly, makes the statements in public that he's quoting that they say he can't quote.
[01:10:47.756 --> 01:10:48.877]  Boy, that's free speech, isn't it?
[01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:50.278]  Here it is.
[01:10:50.278 --> 01:10:59.044]  So this one family, it was a matter of, well, we have other schools, which one would your child like to transfer to?
[01:10:59.044 --> 01:11:02.507]  So, and eventually the home school, which understandably.
[01:11:04.926 --> 01:11:14.298]  The where I've seen the most resistance is with our coaches and it's interesting because for them
[01:11:16.147 --> 01:11:23.749]  I think once they interact with a student who's gender expansive or transgender, it takes the mystique away.
[01:11:23.749 --> 01:11:27.051]  And then they realize, oh, it's just a kid.
[01:11:27.051 --> 01:11:28.351]  Oh, it's just a boy.
[01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:29.391]  It's just a girl.
[01:11:29.391 --> 01:11:30.872]  I get it now.
[01:11:30.872 --> 01:11:43.556]  But until they have that personal interaction, you know, we have male coaches who are horrified at the thought of having a biological girl changing clothes in front of them.
[01:11:45.246 --> 01:12:00.158]  The stigma attached to abuse and just having a male teacher around any female student in that circumstance is just scary for them.
[01:12:00.158 --> 01:12:05.822]  And it's one thing for me to keep saying, it's not a girl.
[01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:06.843]  It's not a girl.
[01:12:06.843 --> 01:12:08.744]  It's not a girl.
[01:12:08.744 --> 01:12:13.147]  You only have boys in the boys' locker room until they
[01:12:14.258 --> 01:12:21.540]  Until you arrive at the mind control to say a naked girl with breasts and a vagina is a boy!
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.340]  Now you're in the cult!
[01:12:35.962 --> 01:12:41.685]  When O'Brien is torturing Winston in 1984, he says, I don't want you to say the number I want.
[01:12:41.685 --> 01:12:43.566]  I want you to believe whatever I tell you.
[01:12:43.566 --> 01:12:44.887]  That 2 plus 2 equals 10, 20, 100.
[01:12:44.887 --> 01:12:47.629]  We can suspend gravity if we want to.
[01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:49.650]  I want to control your mind and your soul.
[01:12:49.650 --> 01:12:50.530]  Is that clear?
[01:12:50.530 --> 01:12:52.952]  And at the end, he totally breaks and he's mentally ill.
[01:12:52.952 --> 01:13:00.476]  Winston Smith arrives at a total psychotic break under a police state.
[01:13:01.658 --> 01:13:03.639]  And what did the White House Press Secretary say?
[01:13:03.639 --> 01:13:04.999]  I played it last hour.
[01:13:04.999 --> 01:13:11.941]  LGBTQXYZ kids are resilient, they're fierce, and they fight back.
[01:13:11.941 --> 01:13:15.803]  Won't decry the mass murder of the children in Tennessee.
[01:13:15.803 --> 01:13:17.583]  None of the big corporations will.
[01:13:17.583 --> 01:13:21.384]  In fact, they've all doubled down because this is what they want to turn you into.
[01:13:21.384 --> 01:13:29.087]  A big, fat man with pink hair, promoting books about killing J.K.
[01:13:29.087 --> 01:13:29.487]  Rowling,
[01:13:30.646 --> 01:13:32.548]  Because you're killing us.
[01:13:32.548 --> 01:13:35.391]  No, the New World Order is killing you.
[01:13:35.391 --> 01:13:42.640]  And you're being brought up as a lazy slob that wants to be in a cool club, that wants to make us bow and give you access to our children.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.101]  No, you're the problem.
[01:13:44.101 --> 01:13:47.746]  Listen to this violent rhetoric of this blob.
[01:13:50.768 --> 01:13:51.889]  And people like J.K.
[01:13:51.889 --> 01:13:56.593]  Rowling need to f***ing stop because my people are dying because of her.
[01:13:56.593 --> 01:13:58.475]  She is killing us.
[01:13:58.475 --> 01:14:00.737]  Oh, but there's one more good thing about this book.
[01:14:00.737 --> 01:14:01.218]  J.K.
[01:14:01.218 --> 01:14:03.640]  Rowling f***ing dies.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:04.140]  Yeah.
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:08.584]  Gretchen had the nerve to kill off the queen of the TERFs and it is glorious.
[01:14:08.584 --> 01:14:12.668]  I only wish that scene could have been even more brutal.
[01:14:12.668 --> 01:14:16.592]  And TERFs are biological women that want to be left alone by men.
[01:14:18.075 --> 01:14:19.595]  Invading their space.
[01:14:19.595 --> 01:14:21.976]  But hey, the men are invading.
[01:14:21.976 --> 01:14:27.257]  Fallon Fox, a transgender MMA fighter, has now broken two female opponents' skulls.
[01:14:27.257 --> 01:14:31.699]  A man beating on women and named Bravest Athlete 2020.
[01:14:31.699 --> 01:14:34.639]  The hate for women is real.
[01:14:34.639 --> 01:14:40.861]  The globalists hate all of us, but the feminist movement was about isolating women from the family so they could be taken out.
[01:14:41.994 --> 01:14:50.099]  A dude pretending to be a woman, knocked out a woman, fracturing her skull in the process, and then bragged about how he was going to beat other women's asses too.
[01:14:50.099 --> 01:14:51.200]  Listen to his voice.
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.021]  Another proud moment in women's athletics.
[01:14:54.021 --> 01:14:54.462]  Yeah.
[01:14:54.462 --> 01:14:55.482]  Crank up the audio.
[01:14:55.482 --> 01:14:57.143]  Play it.
[01:14:57.143 --> 01:14:57.784]  Fox.
[01:14:57.784 --> 01:14:58.084]  Oh!
[01:14:58.084 --> 01:14:59.044]  That's it!
[01:14:59.044 --> 01:14:59.985]  Fallen Fox!
[01:14:59.985 --> 01:15:02.086]  Holy cow!
[01:15:02.086 --> 01:15:03.767]  Game over.
[01:15:03.767 --> 01:15:04.468]  Wow.
[01:15:04.468 --> 01:15:06.389]  And a quick finish to our first
[01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:12.232]  Our first win in this $20,000 Championship Tournament fight.
[01:15:12.232 --> 01:15:17.815]  Your winner in one more battle, Alessa Prince of Hearts!
[01:15:17.815 --> 01:15:19.016]  How you feeling right now?
[01:15:19.016 --> 01:15:19.957]  I'm feeling excellent.
[01:15:19.957 --> 01:15:21.557]  That was sweet, huh?
[01:15:21.557 --> 01:15:23.419]  Did you like that?
[01:15:23.419 --> 01:15:25.119]  Yeah!
[01:15:25.119 --> 01:15:28.021]  And I want to tell everyone else, I'm coming in this tournament.
[01:15:28.021 --> 01:15:30.522]  Every woman in this tournament better look out.
[01:15:30.522 --> 01:15:31.803]  I'm freaking coming.
[01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:36.110]  I'm frickin' coming!
[01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:37.471]  I'm a man!
[01:15:37.471 --> 01:15:39.191]  I'm gonna beat your ass!
[01:15:39.191 --> 01:15:39.651]  Woo!
[01:15:39.651 --> 01:15:43.172]  The bravest woman!
[01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:48.333]  So next time some man breaks his wife's jaws, when the cops show up and say, I'm a woman, they'll go, well, you're brave!
[01:15:48.333 --> 01:15:50.134]  Here's a gold medal, son!
[01:15:50.134 --> 01:15:59.376]  We got stuff even more evil when we come back.
[01:15:59.376 --> 01:16:02.837]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party,
[01:16:03.994 --> 01:16:05.609]  He has a chance of winning.
[01:16:09.045 --> 01:16:14.948]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for President 2024 shirt.
[01:16:14.948 --> 01:16:17.369]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[01:16:17.369 --> 01:16:18.710]  This is an idea the crew had.
[01:16:18.710 --> 01:16:21.351]  I have a triggering shirt, kind of next level.
[01:16:21.351 --> 01:16:22.612]  Alex Jones is right.
[01:16:22.612 --> 01:16:26.974]  There's InfoWars.com on the back, Alex Jones for President 2024 on the front.
[01:16:26.974 --> 01:16:27.994]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:16:27.994 --> 01:16:29.275]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[01:16:29.275 --> 01:16:30.616]  It's high quality.
[01:16:30.616 --> 01:16:34.017]  And it is a exclusive shirt to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:16:34.017 --> 01:16:35.858]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[01:16:35.858 --> 01:16:36.979]  We're doing one run.
[01:16:37.939 --> 01:16:41.542]  ...of Alex Jones for President 2024 shirts.
[01:16:41.542 --> 01:16:48.668]  And we'll have a historic memento, be able to spread the word, meet a lot of like-minded people, and you'll be able to keep us on the air.
[01:16:48.668 --> 01:16:49.789]  No way.
[01:16:49.789 --> 01:16:50.069]  No way.
[01:16:50.069 --> 01:16:51.350]  That's a bridge too far.
[01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:53.112]  That's no, it can't be.
[01:16:53.112 --> 01:16:55.133]  And I said on national television that he was gonna win.
[01:16:59.778 --> 01:17:02.920]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:05.201]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:17:05.201 --> 01:17:09.143]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:17:09.143 --> 01:17:18.088]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:17:18.088 --> 01:17:24.971]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[01:17:24.971 --> 01:17:25.872]  It's really just incredible.
[01:17:26.889 --> 01:17:29.771]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:17:29.771 --> 01:17:36.337]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:17:36.337 --> 01:17:39.359]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:17:39.359 --> 01:17:47.586]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:17:48.286 --> 01:17:52.590]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:57.534]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:17:57.534 --> 01:17:59.455]  Please take action now.
[01:17:59.455 --> 01:18:07.642]  I intend to take the InfoWars armored truck out, or the InfoWars tank as it's so lovingly called.
[01:18:07.642 --> 01:18:12.106]  You came through yesterday and shopped at InfoWarsTore.com, so I'm going to be able to take the truck out.
[01:18:58.692 --> 01:19:01.396]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:19:01.396 --> 01:19:06.282]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[01:19:06.282 --> 01:19:11.589]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[01:19:11.589 --> 01:19:13.452]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully...
[01:19:13.652 --> 01:19:22.315]  To go to InfoWarStore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[01:19:22.315 --> 01:19:28.558]  InfoWarStore.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World.
[01:19:28.558 --> 01:19:30.478]  Ultimate Bone Broth, back in stock.
[01:19:30.478 --> 01:19:37.581]  Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[01:19:38.181 --> 01:19:40.402]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:40.402 --> 01:19:42.222]  Some of the very best products.
[01:19:42.222 --> 01:19:44.343]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWarsTore.
[01:19:44.343 --> 01:19:49.684]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWarsTore.
[01:19:49.684 --> 01:19:52.545]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[01:19:52.545 --> 01:19:53.905]  Plus, they keep us on air.
[01:19:53.905 --> 01:19:55.426]  So again, please take action.
[01:19:55.426 --> 01:20:00.567]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com today, and I thank you.
[01:20:00.567 --> 01:20:06.469]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:13.534 --> 01:20:14.795]  But here's another clip.
[01:20:14.795 --> 01:20:18.477]  This is Columbia Gender Identity Program from their own website.
[01:20:18.477 --> 01:20:24.419]  And all the major universities are involved in this now, except for some of the Christian ones that are still quasi-Christian.
[01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:25.220]  And they've all been on
[01:20:44.087 --> 01:20:48.650]  Speaking engagements where they say, we get $40,000 cut the woman's breast off.
[01:20:48.650 --> 01:20:49.991]  Well, the breast job's $10,000.
[01:20:49.991 --> 01:20:53.973]  So they jack up the price too to cut your breast completely off.
[01:20:53.973 --> 01:20:58.056]  And we get, you know, $30,000 to cut your penis off, your testicles off.
[01:20:58.056 --> 01:20:59.337]  And we've got to affirm this.
[01:20:59.337 --> 01:21:02.099]  So they're also making money while they do it.
[01:21:02.099 --> 01:21:05.481]  This guy is like the Nellie Klaus Schwab.
[01:21:05.481 --> 01:21:07.542]  You can make an appointment for this.
[01:21:07.542 --> 01:21:12.926]  And the children's hospitals are being converted to giant meat grinders to sterilize our boys and girls.
[01:21:12.926 --> 01:21:13.366]  Here's the clip.
[01:21:16.158 --> 01:21:28.602]  The Columbia Gender Identity Program provides evidence-based clinical care to children, adolescents, and adults who identify as transgender, gender non-binary, or gender non-conforming.
[01:21:28.602 --> 01:21:33.923]  Transgender, gender non-conforming people typically face two sources of stress.
[01:21:33.923 --> 01:21:40.545]  The one source of stress is related to the fact that society still is unfamiliar with their gender identity.
[01:21:40.545 --> 01:21:41.205]  Hey, pause it again.
[01:21:41.205 --> 01:21:42.646]  We're going to start this over.
[01:21:43.362 --> 01:21:53.869]  The problem is, Joseph Mingler, 2.0, is the society is not familiar and does not want us to sterilize the children.
[01:21:53.869 --> 01:21:59.093]  But once we get rid of the pee-pees and the breasts and the ovaries, everything is fine.
[01:21:59.093 --> 01:22:00.854]  Of course it's not.
[01:22:00.854 --> 01:22:05.497]  It is because you do not give us access to other children that these people commit suicide.
[01:22:05.497 --> 01:22:07.759]  You see how easy it is?
[01:22:07.759 --> 01:22:12.082]  Just give me the money and give me the pee-pees.
[01:22:12.082 --> 01:22:12.462]  Here it is.
[01:22:15.305 --> 01:22:27.754]  The Columbia Gender Identity Program provides evidence-based clinical care to children, adolescents, and adults who identify as transgender, gender non-binary, or gender non-conforming.
[01:22:27.754 --> 01:22:32.598]  Transgender, gender non-conforming people typically face two sources of stress.
[01:22:33.058 --> 01:22:41.440]  The one source of stress is related to the fact that society still is unfamiliar with their gender identity and gender expression.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:56.863]  The second source of stress is related to the incongruence that they may feel between their self-perceived gender identity, the sense of being a boy, girl, man, woman, or other gender, and their current gender role or the sex characteristics of their body.
[01:22:56.863 --> 01:23:02.544]  And so our program is equipped to help young people and their families with both sources of stress.
[01:23:03.174 --> 01:23:10.616]  In our clinic, one of the things that we emphasize is creating an affirming space where we respect and celebrate gender diversity.
[01:23:10.616 --> 01:23:11.276]  Hit pause again.
[01:23:11.276 --> 01:23:13.477]  Back up 10 seconds.
[01:23:13.477 --> 01:23:20.658]  An affirming atmosphere to not say you're mentally ill or gonna put on a fast track in your elementary school and middle school.
[01:23:20.658 --> 01:23:21.258]  No, no, no.
[01:23:21.258 --> 01:23:22.899]  We're gonna affirm this.
[01:23:24.431 --> 01:23:27.453]  You're a boy, you're a girl, or other gender.
[01:23:27.453 --> 01:23:31.175]  Now it's not just you could be girl of your boy, or boy of your girl.
[01:23:31.175 --> 01:23:35.857]  No, no, now there are hundreds of new things, you see.
[01:23:35.857 --> 01:23:38.098]  We could blind you.
[01:23:38.098 --> 01:23:42.160]  We could, um, we could put horns on your head.
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:46.863]  There is so much we can do, and the taxpayer pays.
[01:23:47.864 --> 01:23:57.646]  They give us some money to do it, and now your testicles get shipped off for medical experiments, and you never have more pesky people.
[01:23:57.646 --> 01:24:00.407]  See how we made it trendy?
[01:24:00.407 --> 01:24:04.067]  See how we made it fun to do?
[01:24:04.067 --> 01:24:06.428]  You will eat some bugs!
[01:24:06.428 --> 01:24:08.168]  You will owns nothings!
[01:24:08.168 --> 01:24:10.129]  You will haves nothings!
[01:24:10.129 --> 01:24:11.849]  You will like it!
[01:24:11.849 --> 01:24:16.590]  You will de-spike protein, starting next month, in the beef.
[01:24:17.290 --> 01:24:19.311]  There's no reason to give the shots.
[01:24:19.311 --> 01:24:31.239]  It does nothing to help the cows, but it creates spike protein in the meat, and then you eat it, and it is a prion, and then you have neurological disorder.
[01:24:31.239 --> 01:24:34.582]  Your brain is becoming trans.
[01:24:34.582 --> 01:24:37.544]  Transitioning into death.
[01:24:38.875 --> 01:24:41.956]  So liberal, huh?
[01:24:41.956 --> 01:24:43.676]  Gives us your children.
[01:24:43.676 --> 01:24:52.018]  Here, let us, American farmers who inject livestock with mRNA, shot this month.
[01:24:52.018 --> 01:24:55.599]  You will, you will, you will.
[01:24:55.599 --> 01:25:01.261]  You will do what we say for you to do.
[01:25:01.261 --> 01:25:02.381]  Let's go back to this monster.
[01:25:03.257 --> 01:25:09.559]  And so our program is equipped to help young people and their families with both sources of stress.
[01:25:09.559 --> 01:25:19.161]  In our clinic, one of the things that we emphasize is creating an affirming space where we respect and celebrate gender diversity and gender minorities.
[01:25:19.161 --> 01:25:28.824]  We know, especially in the case of youth who identify as transgender, gender non-binary, or gender non-conforming, that family acceptance is incredibly important.
[01:25:29.284 --> 01:25:31.585]  When we involve families in treatment.
[01:25:31.585 --> 01:25:33.166]  So we're going to take your kids away from you.
[01:25:33.166 --> 01:25:34.607]  We're going to bully you to submit.
[01:25:34.607 --> 01:25:37.789]  If you don't submit, we've got bills introduced to take your children from you.
[01:25:37.789 --> 01:25:38.590]  You're in a cult.
[01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:39.450]  Don't ask questions.
[01:25:39.450 --> 01:25:40.511]  Affirm what we're doing.
[01:25:40.511 --> 01:25:44.213]  It's a psychological CIA, Tavistock, MI6 operation.
[01:25:44.213 --> 01:25:46.035]  You must submit right now or you're abusive.
[01:25:46.035 --> 01:25:46.695]  Just do it.
[01:25:46.695 --> 01:25:47.596]  I'm a loving woman.
[01:25:47.596 --> 01:25:49.097]  I'm going to invite your children in.
[01:25:49.097 --> 01:25:50.477]  It's so good what you're doing.
[01:25:50.477 --> 01:25:51.618]  We're such heroes.
[01:25:51.618 --> 01:25:53.800]  We're so liberal.
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:54.120]  Here we go.
[01:25:57.352 --> 01:26:04.416]  who may be slaying with complicated feelings around their child.
[01:26:04.416 --> 01:26:10.079]  The family members may be struggling with cutting their son's testicles and penises off.
[01:26:10.079 --> 01:26:15.041]  You may be struggling with having your breast cut off or your uterus removed.
[01:26:15.041 --> 01:26:19.504]  Believe me, you'll not be depressed anymore once we chop it all off!
[01:26:20.124 --> 01:26:24.886]  Several years, your boy will have to wear a cone up in a bloody hole in his body.
[01:26:24.886 --> 01:26:32.368]  It will bleed, it will stink, it will pass, but maybe it will heal over, and now he will have an open wound to urinate out of!
[01:26:32.368 --> 01:26:34.689]  This is not a Hellraiser nightmare!
[01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:36.050]  This is a loving woman!
[01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:37.030]  Listen to her!
[01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:39.871]  We're good to... You are struggling?
[01:26:39.871 --> 01:26:41.872]  You are feeling bad?
[01:26:41.872 --> 01:26:45.293]  You are not wanting to cut your son's peepee off?
[01:26:46.093 --> 01:26:47.633]  Well, don't worry.
[01:26:47.633 --> 01:26:50.814]  We're a government institution.
[01:26:50.814 --> 01:26:52.794]  We're a university.
[01:26:52.794 --> 01:26:58.256]  We will make you feel good about joining the Stockholm Syndrome victim.
[01:26:58.256 --> 01:26:59.936]  We're going to kill all of you!
[01:26:59.936 --> 01:27:02.096]  Total power murder!
[01:27:02.096 --> 01:27:03.517]  Oh, sorry!
[01:27:03.517 --> 01:27:05.397]  Oh, I did not mean to say that.
[01:27:05.397 --> 01:27:06.517]  Listen to her.
[01:27:06.517 --> 01:27:08.778]  She has Stockholm Syndrome, not me.
[01:27:08.778 --> 01:27:11.198]  She actually believes she is a hero!
[01:27:11.198 --> 01:27:12.239]  Ha ha ha!
[01:27:12.239 --> 01:27:13.439]  Here, finish the clip!
[01:27:14.369 --> 01:27:25.672]  Families in treatment were able to provide support for family members who may be struggling with complicated feelings around their child or their family member's transition.
[01:27:25.672 --> 01:27:33.993]  And by providing support to help through that process, we're then able to help them refocus on strengthening and building that relationship.
[01:27:33.993 --> 01:27:34.794]  Hit pause again!
[01:27:34.794 --> 01:27:34.954]  Good!
[01:27:34.954 --> 01:27:35.894]  Tell them!
[01:27:35.894 --> 01:27:36.434]  Rewind it!
[01:27:37.728 --> 01:27:41.169]  Help them focus on helping your child?
[01:27:41.169 --> 01:27:44.029]  Good, yes, help them!
[01:27:44.029 --> 01:27:46.870]  Bring out the scalpel!
[01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:49.331]  No going back now!
[01:27:49.331 --> 01:27:50.011]  Here we go!
[01:27:50.011 --> 01:27:58.173]  Support for family members who may be struggling with complicated feelings around their child or their family member's transition.
[01:27:58.973 --> 01:28:08.760]  And by providing support to help through that process, we're then able to help them refocus on strengthening and building that relationship with their child or family member.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.922]  The relationship that they have with the state and the evil mad scientist.
[01:28:11.922 --> 01:28:23.850]  We're going to come back and finish this and move on to other topics, but this is the total normalization of evil completely out in the open.
[01:28:23.850 --> 01:28:25.812]  And these people mean business.
[01:28:28.194 --> 01:28:32.296]  So don't struggle, we are the establishment.
[01:28:32.296 --> 01:28:41.581]  If a mother or father 20 years ago went in and said, I want to cut my son's Johnson off, they'd put you in a mental institution.
[01:28:41.581 --> 01:28:45.042]  If you cut your child's penis off, you'd go to jail.
[01:28:45.042 --> 01:28:53.487]  But because it is the system and the authority, people cannot believe they're living in a nightmare, so they convince themselves to submit to us.
[01:28:53.487 --> 01:28:56.008]  And once they have done that, we have full control!
[01:28:58.703 --> 01:29:02.116]  Most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:08.181]  I want you all to know something.
[01:29:08.181 --> 01:29:10.142]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:29:10.142 --> 01:29:13.684]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[01:29:13.684 --> 01:29:16.806]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:29:16.806 --> 01:29:21.049]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[01:29:21.049 --> 01:29:23.270]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:26.793]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:29:26.793 --> 01:29:30.255]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:29:30.515 --> 01:29:33.377]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[01:29:33.377 --> 01:29:34.417]  Years ago.
[01:29:34.417 --> 01:29:38.480]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:41.002]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:29:41.002 --> 01:29:43.463]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:29:43.463 --> 01:29:46.585]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:29:46.585 --> 01:29:51.248]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:29:58.854 --> 01:30:05.520]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.442]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:30:07.442 --> 01:30:08.963]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[01:30:08.963 --> 01:30:11.746]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:30:11.746 --> 01:30:13.767]  And it says political prisoner.
[01:30:14.548 --> 01:30:16.510]  With an image of President Trump.
[01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:18.952]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:30:18.952 --> 01:30:21.093]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:30:21.093 --> 01:30:27.679]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[01:30:27.679 --> 01:30:28.740]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:32.863]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:30:32.863 --> 01:30:34.465]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[01:30:34.465 --> 01:30:35.485]  No, I'm not running for President.
[01:30:35.485 --> 01:30:38.047]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[01:30:38.047 --> 01:30:38.828]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:30:38.828 --> 01:30:39.689]  Alex Jones for President.
[01:30:40.389 --> 01:30:43.230]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[01:30:43.230 --> 01:30:45.111]  Great way to fund the operation.
[01:30:45.111 --> 01:30:54.673]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling toll-free AAA at 253-3139.
[01:30:54.673 --> 01:30:55.253]  Right now,
[01:31:00.854 --> 01:31:11.286]  I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarshaw.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[01:31:11.286 --> 01:31:15.612]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in
[01:31:16.172 --> 01:31:19.613]  Many of you for years have never gone to InfoWarshaw.com.
[01:31:19.613 --> 01:31:28.416]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarshaw.com and never experience these great products and never fund the operation.
[01:31:28.416 --> 01:31:31.477]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[01:31:31.477 --> 01:31:32.837]  That's great and I thank you.
[01:31:32.837 --> 01:31:34.358]  But we need funds to operate.
[01:31:34.358 --> 01:31:43.220]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil and our Fizzy Magnesium and our SleepAid and our Nitric Oxide and our Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:44.681]  All of these are really great products.
[01:31:44.881 --> 01:31:45.882]  This is their big move.
[01:31:45.882 --> 01:31:48.144]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:31:48.144 --> 01:31:48.845]  He doesn't care.
[01:32:10.171 --> 01:32:11.413]  That's not his job.
[01:32:11.413 --> 01:32:13.176]  He's not the President of the United States.
[01:32:13.176 --> 01:32:17.042]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:32:17.042 --> 01:32:21.530]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:22.651]  They must be opposed.
[01:32:23.274 --> 01:32:26.696]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[01:32:26.696 --> 01:32:27.876]  No.
[01:32:27.876 --> 01:32:28.717]  No.
[01:32:28.717 --> 01:32:29.477]  No.
[01:32:29.477 --> 01:32:30.357]  Exactly.
[01:32:30.357 --> 01:32:33.939]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:32:33.939 --> 01:32:37.040]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:39.522]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:32:39.522 --> 01:32:42.023]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:45.645]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:32:45.645 --> 01:32:48.166]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[01:32:48.166 --> 01:32:48.566]  You're right.
[01:32:48.846 --> 01:32:53.589]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[01:32:53.589 --> 01:33:00.394]  And we say no to your war!
[01:33:00.394 --> 01:33:05.017]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:05.017 --> 01:33:06.298]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.938 --> 01:33:24.702]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:24.702 --> 01:33:32.827]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.827 --> 01:33:45.096]  We know you're feeling bad about bringing your nine-year-old in to have his testicles and penis cut off, or your daughter's breasts or uterus removed.
[01:33:45.096 --> 01:33:48.798]  It is like abortion, once you do it and believe it is okay.
[01:33:49.793 --> 01:33:53.236]  You will now defend it forever after we have you commit the crime.
[01:33:53.236 --> 01:33:58.060]  Just like we released the poison shot and paid off the medical system to cover it up.
[01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:00.442]  Now they're committed to the lie.
[01:34:00.442 --> 01:34:08.369]  Now they will help commit all the new crimes that we are going to bring forward against humanity.
[01:34:08.369 --> 01:34:11.032]  We have the full backing of the system.
[01:34:11.032 --> 01:34:14.415]  It is part of the tip of the spear of our depopulation operation.
[01:34:16.283 --> 01:34:21.567]  Of course there'll be a certain nostalgia for your daughter or your son's body parts.
[01:34:21.567 --> 01:34:23.829]  Maybe you wanted grandchildren.
[01:34:23.829 --> 01:34:31.335]  But you affirmed their identity that we taught them in the school and confused them like they were going to be a superhero.
[01:34:31.335 --> 01:34:34.437]  When they had their testicles cut off.
[01:34:34.437 --> 01:34:36.419]  When their penis was removed.
[01:34:36.419 --> 01:34:37.780]  Or when they took the shot.
[01:34:39.517 --> 01:34:44.319]  But the pain will continue on, and we will medicalize them and control them.
[01:34:44.319 --> 01:35:01.525]  That is why the CIA, when it occupied Germany in 1945 until 1990, took over a million children, up to 30,000 per town, from Christians, and placed them with what we call the New Family!
[01:35:02.677 --> 01:35:08.999]  Convicted pedophiles who would rape the babies from age six months on.
[01:35:08.999 --> 01:35:19.563]  We give the girls to the lesbians, we give the boys to the quote gay men who have sex with them, and then we use them to recruit new children.
[01:35:19.563 --> 01:35:21.744]  But our program was exposed.
[01:35:21.744 --> 01:35:25.926]  So our friends in MI6 developed the transgender program.
[01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:30.593]  In 1967, we launched operational in 1981.
[01:35:30.593 --> 01:35:36.238]  We have gone full operational in the year 2015.
[01:35:36.238 --> 01:35:39.962]  And now you'll see the great success of our operation.
[01:35:39.962 --> 01:35:41.844]  They are completely confused.
[01:35:41.844 --> 01:35:45.427]  They cannot believe we're attacking them, and they are submitting well.
[01:35:45.427 --> 01:35:48.390]  Our program is a resounding success!
[01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:49.251]  Hail Lucifer!
[01:35:53.407 --> 01:36:07.572]  We also have useful idiots like this woman with me on stage, who feel so good how she gives you an offering environment when you're having feelings and questions about mutilating your children.
[01:36:07.572 --> 01:36:11.613]  Oh, they'll be so happy once they've been chopped.
[01:36:11.613 --> 01:36:19.836]  And then, when they get depressed and upset, we will tell them it's because we're not being given access to more children.
[01:36:21.479 --> 01:36:25.401]  But when we are given more access, you see how the snowball rolls.
[01:36:25.401 --> 01:36:42.967]  And of course we know that many of the children we mutilate and destroy as part of the depopulation societal breakdown operation will sue us, but we will control that because we will have such a wide group of the abused.
[01:36:42.967 --> 01:36:49.110]  Most of them under Stockholm Syndrome will join us and believe they are victims not of us, but those who try to protect them.
[01:36:50.245 --> 01:36:57.210]  And we will march forward with armies to begin killing anyone that does not submit to our program!
[01:36:57.210 --> 01:37:10.839]  Example, two weeks ago, no one in the establishment corporate press, not the White House Press Secretary, not ABC, not CNN, not CNBC, would decry the murder of children!
[01:37:10.839 --> 01:37:14.682]  We have achieved full mind control!
[01:37:16.223 --> 01:37:18.865]  This is our greatest success!
[01:37:18.865 --> 01:37:30.056]  And as they begin to die from the chemicals, radiologicals, and electromagnetic frequencies, we will tell them you are depressed because you do not know who you are!
[01:37:30.056 --> 01:37:36.642]  Chopping parts of your body off as a ghost dance of sorts will protect you.
[01:37:37.881 --> 01:37:40.427]  Yes, look at our slaves.
[01:37:40.427 --> 01:37:45.919]  Look at how they defend Big Pharma, and love the establishment, and love nuclear war!
[01:37:47.150 --> 01:37:56.297]  And we will give them all of this for our father Satan has promised us dominion once we have killed them down to 500 million.
[01:37:56.297 --> 01:38:07.106]  Then those of us that have experimented upon their bodies will be given the knowledge of the transformation and will ascend into the Evermind forever in the name of Lucifer!
[01:38:07.106 --> 01:38:09.708]  So liberal!
[01:38:09.708 --> 01:38:11.910]  Liberate us, O great Lucifer!
[01:38:17.202 --> 01:38:17.702]  There's the clip.
[01:38:17.702 --> 01:38:29.332]  The Columbia Gender Ethnicity Program is housed in the Department of Psychiatry, and that is in part because we believe transgender cares about more than hormones and surgery.
[01:38:29.332 --> 01:38:37.718]  It's really about living your life as a transgender person, or as the gender that you perceive yourself to be, and helping the family.
[01:38:37.718 --> 01:38:38.179]  Hit pause, please.
[01:38:38.179 --> 01:38:38.519]  Five seconds.
[01:38:38.519 --> 01:38:39.500]  Back up.
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:44.424]  Living the life, the dream of the biomedical combine.
[01:38:45.683 --> 01:39:05.775]  Living the life of depression and pain with the other victims, but we will be there explaining, you are so unhappy because you do not, you do not accept it by the evil ones that did not want us to liberate you by cutting off parts of your body.
[01:39:05.775 --> 01:39:09.397]  We must liberate them, and we will.
[01:39:11.061 --> 01:39:13.482]  Yes, AR-15.
[01:39:13.482 --> 01:39:20.445]  Good, and they just caught a big liberal's son who is transitioning.
[01:39:20.445 --> 01:39:21.565]  They went to his house.
[01:39:21.565 --> 01:39:25.527]  The neighbors warned he was planning to liberate a school.
[01:39:25.527 --> 01:39:28.288]  He was abused.
[01:39:28.288 --> 01:39:30.009]  There's a new story in Colorado.
[01:39:30.009 --> 01:39:35.451]  They were mean to him, so he got the rifle.
[01:39:37.372 --> 01:39:47.976]  And he was going to do transgender surgery on the school by firing those beautiful 2,000 mile-per-hour bullets into them.
[01:39:47.976 --> 01:39:48.996]  Oh!
[01:39:48.996 --> 01:39:53.858]  And as we... Oh, we could do it so easy like that, but we do it slowly.
[01:39:53.858 --> 01:39:58.560]  Pee-pee today, they kill themselves tomorrow.
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:00.541]  Oh, let's finish up now.
[01:40:01.670 --> 01:40:13.538]  It's really about living your life as a transgender person or as the gender that you perceive yourself to be and helping the family and the environment to adjust to that.
[01:40:13.538 --> 01:40:20.143]  But from the Department of Psychiatry, we provide access to all the other specialties at Columbia.
[01:40:20.143 --> 01:40:29.570]  People come to us at different points in their life and at different places in their journey with a varying understanding of who they are themselves and their gender.
[01:40:30.370 --> 01:40:42.202]  Our main goal at the Columbia Gender Identity Program is to meet each person wherever they are on that path and to help as they become the unique individual that they've always known themselves to be.
[01:40:42.202 --> 01:40:51.432]  We recognize that there's no one way to be transgender, but rather that there is a whole diverse range of gender identities and gender expressions.
[01:40:52.092 --> 01:40:56.296]  And you will get that from the Department of Psychiatry and Surgeries!
[01:40:56.296 --> 01:41:01.921]  You're finally going to be who you need to be under our scalpel!
[01:41:01.921 --> 01:41:09.027]  You've all seen the Hollywood women that get, beautiful women, get hundreds of surgeries until they look like monsters.
[01:41:09.027 --> 01:41:13.892]  But that is a beautiful thing, and all the money goes to us!
[01:41:13.892 --> 01:41:17.135]  But it's not enough to chop up women's faces and bodies.
[01:41:18.595 --> 01:41:24.520]  We're going to chop up, and we are chopping up, and there's nothing you're going to do!
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:30.466]  Because after all, we speak in an NPR Klaus Schwab voice.
[01:41:30.466 --> 01:41:31.847]  My final comments now.
[01:41:31.847 --> 01:41:44.679]  The program really wants to help every young person and every adult in their family to find what is comfortable for them and support them in that effort.
[01:41:45.831 --> 01:41:51.795]  Oh, we want to help every family and every child?
[01:41:51.795 --> 01:41:55.837]  Please give us access to children in the ancient times!
[01:41:55.837 --> 01:42:01.340]  We threw you on fires to Moloch and flames and pyramids of death!
[01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:06.483]  But now... Now we use more sophisticated models!
[01:42:06.483 --> 01:42:08.725]  Give us our children now!
[01:42:12.017 --> 01:42:14.941]  You are having bad feelings about me.
[01:42:14.941 --> 01:42:18.567]  Do not listen to your conscience.
[01:42:18.567 --> 01:42:24.355]  Give me your child now!
[01:42:24.355 --> 01:42:26.638]  Give me a child now!
[01:42:26.638 --> 01:42:27.960]  I'm a liberal!
[01:42:28.972 --> 01:42:31.294]  Let me cut them up!
[01:42:31.294 --> 01:42:35.476]  We've set this up so we can kill you people legally!
[01:42:35.476 --> 01:42:38.498]  And how dare you people try to stop us!
[01:42:38.498 --> 01:42:41.279]  You're gonna give us access to your children!
[01:42:41.279 --> 01:42:42.960]  Nuclear war!
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:44.141]  And death!
[01:42:44.141 --> 01:42:44.782]  Yes!
[01:42:44.782 --> 01:42:45.042]  5G!
[01:42:45.042 --> 01:42:47.883]  Give them a chance!
[01:42:47.883 --> 01:42:48.984]  Oh, Satan!
[01:42:48.984 --> 01:42:50.605]  We love you!
[01:42:50.605 --> 01:42:52.266]  Kill everyone!
[01:42:52.266 --> 01:42:55.308]  Kill them!
[01:42:55.308 --> 01:42:56.569]  Kill them!
[01:42:56.569 --> 01:42:57.129]  Kill them!
[01:42:59.932 --> 01:43:03.075]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:43:03.075 --> 01:43:05.357]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:43:05.357 --> 01:43:09.301]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:43:09.301 --> 01:43:17.388]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:43:17.388 --> 01:43:26.016]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:30.663]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:43:30.663 --> 01:43:36.469]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:43:36.469 --> 01:43:39.511]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:43:39.511 --> 01:43:48.439]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:43:48.439 --> 01:43:52.023]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:52.703 --> 01:43:57.688]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to m4store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:43:57.688 --> 01:43:59.089]  Please take action now.
[01:43:59.089 --> 01:44:03.233]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:44:03.233 --> 01:44:06.977]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[01:44:06.977 --> 01:44:09.379]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[01:44:09.379 --> 01:44:11.761]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:44:11.761 --> 01:44:14.284]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:44:15.084 --> 01:44:19.528]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[01:44:19.528 --> 01:44:22.930]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[01:44:22.930 --> 01:44:26.993]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:44:26.993 --> 01:44:30.656]  It was almost as if it were a plan, in quotes, it just can't end.
[01:44:31.036 --> 01:44:34.880]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:37.002]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:44:37.002 --> 01:44:38.624]  They are nothing but distractions.
[01:44:38.624 --> 01:44:40.866]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[01:44:40.866 --> 01:44:43.309]  You silenced those voices.
[01:44:43.309 --> 01:44:47.073]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[01:44:47.073 --> 01:44:53.500]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[01:45:02.246 --> 01:45:04.847]  This is their big move.
[01:45:04.847 --> 01:45:08.650]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:45:08.650 --> 01:45:10.351]  He doesn't care.
[01:45:10.351 --> 01:45:11.612]  That's not his job.
[01:45:11.612 --> 01:45:13.353]  He's not the president of the United States.
[01:45:13.353 --> 01:45:17.216]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:45:17.216 --> 01:45:21.719]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:45:21.719 --> 01:45:22.820]  They must be opposed.
[01:45:23.584 --> 01:45:26.867]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[01:45:26.867 --> 01:45:28.048]  No.
[01:45:28.048 --> 01:45:28.889]  No.
[01:45:28.889 --> 01:45:29.649]  No.
[01:45:29.649 --> 01:45:30.550]  Exactly.
[01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:34.113]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:45:34.113 --> 01:45:37.215]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:45:37.215 --> 01:45:39.697]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:45:39.697 --> 01:45:42.199]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:45:42.199 --> 01:45:45.822]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:45:45.822 --> 01:45:48.344]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[01:45:48.344 --> 01:45:48.745]  You're right.
[01:45:49.025 --> 01:45:53.767]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[01:45:53.767 --> 01:45:59.130]  And we say no to your war!
[01:45:59.130 --> 01:46:07.333]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the global, in their own words, plan for our future.
[01:46:07.333 --> 01:46:08.774]  That is the hellish future.
[01:46:08.774 --> 01:46:17.698]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarshore.com.
[01:46:18.178 --> 01:46:23.763]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:46:23.763 --> 01:46:26.365]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:46:26.365 --> 01:46:31.730]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHorror.com.
[01:46:31.730 --> 01:46:35.694]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:46:35.694 --> 01:46:41.218]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:46:41.218 --> 01:46:43.660]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[01:46:44.421 --> 01:46:45.421]  Or unsigned copies.
[01:46:45.421 --> 01:46:55.846]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[01:46:55.846 --> 01:46:56.886]  This is an Infowar.
[01:46:56.886 --> 01:47:00.347]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[01:47:00.347 --> 01:47:06.250]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:13.753 --> 01:47:20.661]  Every major TV program, every corporate show, every major magazine, every major sports team.
[01:47:20.661 --> 01:47:23.324]  Transgender, transgender, transgender.
[01:47:23.324 --> 01:47:24.765]  To annihilate us.
[01:47:24.765 --> 01:47:30.832]  And so to make it cool that most people are sterile, most people are totally poisoned by all the chemicals.
[01:47:30.832 --> 01:47:33.014]  And it's like, hey, it's liberal.
[01:47:33.014 --> 01:47:35.297]  And then they organize the victims into their army.
[01:47:37.136 --> 01:47:52.178]  You saw in Tennessee and other legislatures where they're passing laws saying, hey, you're not going to cut five-year-olds' penises off, the schools aren't going to keep it a secret from parents, you're not going to run this cult run by psychiatrists and big think tanks and big scientific institutions with limited funding.
[01:47:52.178 --> 01:47:52.499]  They're like,
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:54.600]  Well, we're going to get violent then.
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:58.201]  We're going to storm capitals and beat up state police and attack people.
[01:47:58.201 --> 01:48:00.302]  And the liberals are like, well, this is good what they did.
[01:48:00.302 --> 01:48:03.923]  How dare you expel members of the Tennessee legislature?
[01:48:03.923 --> 01:48:08.144]  There weren't Republicans there on January 6th saying attack the Capitol.
[01:48:08.144 --> 01:48:09.284]  But they wanted to expel them.
[01:48:09.284 --> 01:48:11.525]  Well, they actually attacked the Capitol.
[01:48:11.525 --> 01:48:16.486]  It's like, well, I mean, they're stepping on the toes of trans rights.
[01:48:16.486 --> 01:48:19.387]  And they're not giving their guns up when one of our people
[01:48:20.265 --> 01:48:26.896]  A poor young woman, brainwashed, put on drugs by a psychiatrist, wound up, goes and does this.
[01:48:26.896 --> 01:48:30.481]  And I love that photo you found of our little Deutsch friend.
[01:48:31.618 --> 01:48:34.799]  I know you're feeling bad about what you're about to do to your daughter or son.
[01:48:51.027 --> 01:48:51.928]  But listen to me.
[01:48:51.928 --> 01:48:53.349]  I'm a doctor.
[01:48:53.349 --> 01:48:55.670]  You may have heard of Joseph Mingler.
[01:48:55.670 --> 01:48:57.051]  He was a doctor.
[01:48:57.051 --> 01:49:02.155]  Trust the science of what we are about to do.
[01:49:02.155 --> 01:49:03.116]  Look at me.
[01:49:03.116 --> 01:49:04.597]  How cool I am.
[01:49:04.597 --> 01:49:06.278]  Yes.
[01:49:06.278 --> 01:49:07.539]  Yes, yes.
[01:49:07.539 --> 01:49:09.800]  Have you seen the Dark Crystal?
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:12.102]  The Skeksis are beautiful.
[01:49:12.102 --> 01:49:14.303]  It is the young's energy we take.
[01:49:14.303 --> 01:49:19.927]  Our god demands it and he delivers power in this realm for what we do.
[01:49:22.219 --> 01:49:33.264]  Alright, listen, I have just spent, this is actually old-fashioned Alex Jones, because I'm always trying to get to a whole bunch of news, but the old days, sometimes I'd do a whole 3-4 hour show on one topic.
[01:49:33.264 --> 01:49:36.845]  I just actually hit a stack.
[01:49:36.845 --> 01:49:45.709]  Most days I come in here and say, I've got all these stacks, and I kind of just skim the surface, but you notice, this whole stack, I watched, I read, I looked at, all this.
[01:49:47.386 --> 01:49:51.949]  That's just, that's just one of these things.
[01:49:51.949 --> 01:49:53.409]  One of these nightmares.
[01:49:53.409 --> 01:49:57.071]  Every one of them, incredible admissions of just crime against humanity.
[01:49:57.071 --> 01:49:58.352]  That's just one.
[01:49:58.352 --> 01:50:00.713]  Oh, would you like more?
[01:50:00.713 --> 01:50:12.040]  Stack upon stack upon stack upon stack upon stack upon stack upon stack upon stack.
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:13.961]  Oh, how about the AI stack?
[01:50:17.734 --> 01:50:23.297]  It's only an inch thick, about 10 articles.
[01:50:23.297 --> 01:50:25.458]  Oh, it's pretty important too.
[01:50:25.458 --> 01:50:26.979]  It's all part of the same plan.
[01:50:26.979 --> 01:50:33.283]  Think you might want to know a little bit about that?
[01:50:33.283 --> 01:50:37.565]  Think you might want to know what's going on a little bit there?
[01:50:37.565 --> 01:50:38.506]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:50:41.531 --> 01:50:45.713]  If you're aware of the enemy operation, it can't work.
[01:50:45.713 --> 01:50:53.636]  But if you don't admit how scientific, how premeditated, how beyond evil it is...
[01:50:56.636 --> 01:51:08.405]  You don't have a hope in hell of beating these people, but the minute you realize there's God and there's the devil, the minute you realize there's good and there's evil, the minute you realize their operation and know that... Get this clip ready.
[01:51:08.405 --> 01:51:09.947]  You know, people say, well, everybody knows this.
[01:51:09.947 --> 01:51:12.829]  No, the general public doesn't know this.
[01:51:12.829 --> 01:51:20.495]  The reason O-Tip Jesus is a great communicator is he gets into complex, deep stuff all the time, but he also keeps restating the basics every day.
[01:51:20.495 --> 01:51:22.897]  That's why I watch his show almost every day.
[01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:32.372]  And what's he tell the public?
[01:51:32.372 --> 01:51:37.255]  He tells them, the whole media is taking over and is your enemy.
[01:51:37.255 --> 01:51:44.461]  The whole thing's weaponized against you and you better get that through your brain and into your soul.
[01:51:46.636 --> 01:51:51.137]  You can't reason with it, you can't play games with it, it doesn't go away, it doesn't stop.
[01:51:51.137 --> 01:51:57.519]  It comes after you, and it comes after you, and it comes after you because you're made in the image of God, and this thing does not like you.
[01:51:57.519 --> 01:52:05.501]  Because if you think we've already built some incredible stuff they've tried to twist, can you imagine what it is we're about to do?
[01:52:05.501 --> 01:52:11.182]  Not just in this dimension, that our bodies are a manifestation of the higher dimensions, a signature of what we are.
[01:52:14.448 --> 01:52:17.450]  These are the losers that have gone along with the system.
[01:52:17.450 --> 01:52:20.011]  So I know our general audience knows the media is the enemy.
[01:52:20.011 --> 01:52:21.792]  I know you know that.
[01:52:21.792 --> 01:52:24.233]  But we've got to reach out to everybody else and explain to them.
[01:52:24.233 --> 01:52:30.077]  When you watch mainstream media, and I tell my family this, I say, and you know, it used to be so fun.
[01:52:30.077 --> 01:52:35.039]  I haven't been able to suspend disbelief in 20 years.
[01:52:35.039 --> 01:52:40.702]  But I remember when I was, until about 20 years ago, when I was a kid, I would always suspend disbelief.
[01:52:40.702 --> 01:52:41.283]  It was a good movie.
[01:52:42.048 --> 01:52:47.193]  It was the godfather or alien or you know the thing or whatever it was.
[01:52:47.193 --> 01:52:55.301]  I could go and have this incredible experience where I was there and it was real because I decided to accept it in my subconscious and my conscious is real.
[01:52:55.301 --> 01:52:56.643]  It merges the conscious and subconscious.
[01:52:56.643 --> 01:52:58.124]  You go into a form of mind control.
[01:52:58.124 --> 01:53:01.688]  Big giant screen and you just decide this is real and you're having this experience.
[01:53:03.567 --> 01:53:08.276]  About 30 years ago I got where I could maybe suspend disbelief every once in a while.
[01:53:08.276 --> 01:53:11.802]  You could, I can't suspend disbelief even if I drink 10 vodkas.
[01:53:12.631 --> 01:53:13.071]  I've tried.
[01:53:13.071 --> 01:53:16.493]  I've gone to a movie and said, let me try to suspend disbelief.
[01:53:16.493 --> 01:53:17.474]  Alcohol helps me do it.
[01:53:17.474 --> 01:53:18.695]  Let me, I can't even do it there.
[01:53:18.695 --> 01:53:20.956]  You cannot get me to suspend disbelief.
[01:53:20.956 --> 01:53:23.658]  I sit there and I see all the propaganda, every bit of it.
[01:53:23.658 --> 01:53:26.519]  It's like a giant exam to see a movie or a show.
[01:53:26.519 --> 01:53:28.460]  Gives me a freaking headache.
[01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:29.741]  But I'll go with family.
[01:53:29.741 --> 01:53:30.421]  I'll watch it.
[01:53:30.421 --> 01:53:31.342]  I'll do it.
[01:53:31.342 --> 01:53:32.263]  And I'm just sitting there.
[01:53:32.263 --> 01:53:34.524]  You know, the good news is my whole family is the same now.
[01:53:34.524 --> 01:53:36.285]  Everybody I know is the same.
[01:53:36.285 --> 01:53:37.806]  That's why Hollywood's dead.
[01:53:37.806 --> 01:53:39.187]  They mean their spell is dead.
[01:53:40.083 --> 01:53:44.706]  So now they've got to target children because that's the only group that still suspends disbelief.
[01:53:44.706 --> 01:53:45.946]  We've broken with them.
[01:53:45.946 --> 01:53:47.127]  They've already lost.
[01:53:47.127 --> 01:53:49.548]  Their only hope is to get our children.
[01:53:49.548 --> 01:53:59.014]  So as bad as all this is, do you, did you just hear what I, I just gave you the giant 10 trillion pound key of victory!
[01:53:59.014 --> 01:54:00.715]  We've already won!
[01:54:02.807 --> 01:54:04.668]  There's an exponential awakening!
[01:54:04.668 --> 01:54:07.589]  People aren't having suspended disbelief anymore!
[01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:15.553]  They're actually listening and thinking and analyzing in a conscious way, connected to God!
[01:54:15.553 --> 01:54:16.594]  Skynet's blown!
[01:54:16.594 --> 01:54:25.718]  So all they can do is go back to the future, our children, who aren't the future yet but are about to be, they're going back to the future.
[01:54:27.537 --> 01:54:33.520]  To destroy our children, and they're in a mechanized, scientific attack to do it.
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:35.701]  Will you let them do it?
[01:54:35.701 --> 01:54:40.564]  Because if you do this, God is one trillion percent real.
[01:54:40.564 --> 01:54:43.265]  Look at those stars, the Earth, all the beauty.
[01:54:43.265 --> 01:54:45.907]  This thing's a million trillion percent real.
[01:54:45.907 --> 01:54:49.669]  I have literally interfaced in the third heaven on a nightly basis.
[01:54:50.689 --> 01:54:54.090]  I am 100% now completely jacked in!
[01:54:54.090 --> 01:55:01.111]  And I can tell you, God and the angels are real as everything as the sun setting and sun rising!
[01:55:01.111 --> 01:55:03.092]  And so is Satan!
[01:55:03.092 --> 01:55:08.733]  And if you don't stand up for the children, God is gonna cut your ass off!
[01:55:08.733 --> 01:55:14.254]  And that means from Him.
[01:55:14.254 --> 01:55:19.115]  And the Bible and everything tells us the whole universe is locks and keys.
[01:55:19.115 --> 01:55:20.015]  God is male.
[01:55:21.547 --> 01:55:25.189]  But God gives us the universe that is female and procreative.
[01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:28.111]  The universe is God's womb and is the female.
[01:55:28.111 --> 01:55:31.793]  And God is the progenitor and the master and the director of it all.
[01:55:31.793 --> 01:55:34.335]  And Christ is the groom and we are the bride.
[01:55:34.335 --> 01:55:38.258]  If you don't decide to marry Jesus Christ, you will marry Satan.
[01:55:38.258 --> 01:55:42.280]  And I'm asking you now, men and women, do you marry Jesus Christ?
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:43.901]  Or do you marry Satan?
[01:55:43.901 --> 01:55:47.804]  You better choose who you're getting in bed with.
[01:55:47.804 --> 01:55:48.344]  Spiritually.
[01:55:50.509 --> 01:56:03.435]  And it is sexual, not in like sex, but in procreation, the future, the ideas, the things we build, those are our children!
[01:56:03.435 --> 01:56:04.256]  Play Hotel Jesus.
[01:56:05.393 --> 01:56:06.373]  Stop watching TV.
[01:56:06.373 --> 01:56:07.094]  You got to turn it off.
[01:56:07.094 --> 01:56:08.595]  There's nothing on that TV.
[01:56:08.595 --> 01:56:11.196]  The TV has been completely compromised.
[01:56:11.196 --> 01:56:14.497]  Everything that comes out of that TV has been compromised.
[01:56:14.497 --> 01:56:17.439]  The TV is for conscious folk only.
[01:56:17.439 --> 01:56:30.805]  If you are not conscious and you are not watching TV with a conscious mind, meaning you're not seeing the propaganda and agendas in your TV shows and your TV content and Netflix, whatever it is, put it down because you're probably being brainwashed.
[01:56:30.805 --> 01:56:34.107]  When you look at TV, you need to be able to pick it apart.
[01:56:34.787 --> 01:56:41.272]  Look at the shows you're watching and try to figure out what type of conditioning are they trying to promote?
[01:56:41.272 --> 01:56:44.595]  What type of conditioning are they pushing on my children?
[01:56:44.595 --> 01:56:47.457]  What type of conditioning are they pushing on my family?
[01:56:47.457 --> 01:56:48.338]  What's their agenda?
[01:56:48.338 --> 01:56:50.280]  Because there's an agenda in all these shows.
[01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:51.260]  Stop watching TV.
[01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:52.001]  You got to turn it off.
[01:56:52.001 --> 01:56:53.482]  There's nothing on that TV.
[01:56:53.482 --> 01:56:56.084]  The TV has been completely compromised.
[01:56:56.084 --> 01:56:57.826]  Everything that comes out of that TV.
[01:56:57.826 --> 01:56:58.967]  It's a very short clip.
[01:56:58.967 --> 01:56:59.707]  It says it all.
[01:56:59.707 --> 01:57:00.348]  Share it.
[01:57:00.348 --> 01:57:00.628]  All right.
[01:57:03.126 --> 01:57:05.246]  I didn't get to China to inspect ships in Taiwan Strait.
[01:57:05.246 --> 01:57:06.527]  Taiwan says it won't cooperate.
[01:57:06.527 --> 01:57:07.907]  War's about to start.
[01:57:07.907 --> 01:57:10.408]  I won't get into Saudi Arabia saying we're done with the United States.
[01:57:10.408 --> 01:57:11.908]  The Crown Prince saying it's all over.
[01:57:11.908 --> 01:57:12.628]  He's leaving the dollar.
[01:57:12.628 --> 01:57:14.188]  That should have been the whole show!
[01:57:14.188 --> 01:57:16.989]  That's so massive!
[01:57:16.989 --> 01:57:19.650]  On and on and on and on!
[01:57:19.650 --> 01:57:25.071]  Biden to now sign an executive order banning all new gas cars, just like California just did.
[01:57:25.071 --> 01:57:25.431]  Boom!
[01:57:25.431 --> 01:57:27.291]  Massive!
[01:57:27.291 --> 01:57:28.592]  Massive!
[01:57:28.592 --> 01:57:30.252]  There's a whole damn stamp right there!
[01:57:33.789 --> 01:57:36.990]  I don't put these stacks up here to make it look like I got a bunch of news.
[01:57:36.990 --> 01:57:41.731]  You just saw an hour and 45 minutes of one stack, brother!
[01:57:41.731 --> 01:57:43.971]  And I didn't even hit it off!
[01:57:43.971 --> 01:57:44.712]  They'll be right back.
[01:57:44.712 --> 01:57:49.313]  Stay with us!
[01:57:49.313 --> 01:57:55.534]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[01:57:58.959 --> 01:58:04.880]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for President 2024 shirt.
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:07.301]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[01:58:07.301 --> 01:58:11.282]  This is an idea the crew had to have a triggering shirt, kind of next level.
[01:58:11.282 --> 01:58:12.522]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:58:12.522 --> 01:58:16.883]  There's Infowars.com on the back, Alex Jones for President 2024 on the front.
[01:58:16.883 --> 01:58:17.923]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:58:17.923 --> 01:58:19.183]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[01:58:19.183 --> 01:58:20.524]  It's high quality.
[01:58:20.524 --> 01:58:23.944]  And it is a exclusive shirt to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:23.944 --> 01:58:25.785]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[01:58:25.785 --> 01:58:26.905]  We're doing one run.
[01:58:27.785 --> 01:58:28.665]  I intend to take the InfoWars
[01:58:54.056 --> 01:58:57.703]  Armored truck out, or the InfoWars tank as it's so lovingly called.
[01:58:57.703 --> 01:59:02.031]  You came through yesterday and shopped at InfoWarsStore.com, so I'm gonna be able to take the truck out.
[01:59:50.191 --> 01:59:56.096]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[02:00:04.830 --> 02:00:10.812]  The genetic editing of plants to contain edible vaccines is well underway.
[02:00:10.812 --> 02:00:19.435]  Work is being done with bananas, potatoes, tomatoes, lettuce, rice, wheat, soybeans, and corn.
[02:00:19.435 --> 02:00:26.737]  Companies like Medicago are using gene editing to turn plants into mini bioreactors.
[02:00:27.097 --> 02:00:35.606]  Medicago's manufacturing facility looks like a nursery, but inside these plants, they're growing a new kind of vaccine.
[02:00:35.606 --> 02:00:39.110]  The technology is called a virus-like particle.
[02:00:39.110 --> 02:00:47.299]  At Medicago, we use a careful step-by-step process to develop vaccines, using our plants as mini bioreactors.
[02:00:47.299 --> 02:00:47.679]  We start
[02:00:49.244 --> 02:00:49.745]  We're good to go.
[02:01:05.948 --> 02:01:12.116]  We submerge the plants in a bath with the bacteria that carries the information into the plant cells.
[02:01:12.116 --> 02:01:17.663]  And using a vacuum, we suck out the air between the plant cells and replace it with the liquid.
[02:01:17.663 --> 02:01:19.245]  The plants absorb it like a sponge.
[02:01:20.416 --> 02:01:29.940]  At the end of their bacterial bath, we return our plants to a carefully controlled greenhouse to let them get on with their natural growing business for at least four days.
[02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:36.062]  Now the plants will start producing the most important ingredient of our vaccines, virus-like particles.
[02:01:36.582 --> 02:01:41.185]  Gene editing is now officially in our meat industry.
[02:01:41.185 --> 02:01:51.992]  Lobbyists for the Cattlemen and Pork Associations in several states have confirmed that they will be using the mRNA COVID vaccines on their livestock.
[02:01:51.992 --> 02:02:00.478]  Attorney Tom Renz has been warning that there is no law requiring anyone to give informed consent for vaccine food.
[02:02:01.258 --> 02:02:09.623]  There are no laws requiring anyone to tell you the food you are buying has been vaxxed with the spike protein clot shot.
[02:02:09.623 --> 02:02:15.706]  The UK recently passed into law the Genetic Technology Precision Breeding Bill.
[02:02:15.706 --> 02:02:26.452]  The bill amends the Environmental Protection Act of 1990 to exclude references to precision bred organisms so far as they relate to marketing.
[02:02:27.172 --> 02:02:31.815]  Precision-bred organism is another term for gene-edited.
[02:02:31.815 --> 02:02:39.198]  So now in the UK, food that's been gene-edited can be legally marketed as non-GMO.
[02:02:39.198 --> 02:02:47.222]  And if this UK gene-edited meat makes its way to America, it can be labeled non-GMO here as well.
[02:02:47.222 --> 02:02:52.205]  And so long as it's butchered in America, it can be labeled product of USA.
[02:02:53.447 --> 02:03:00.954]  The fake alternative meat being pushed by Bill Gates and others is made of immortal cell lines.
[02:03:00.954 --> 02:03:04.317]  In other words, cancerous tumor cells.
[02:03:04.317 --> 02:03:07.901]  Real meat is being blamed for climate change.
[02:03:07.901 --> 02:03:13.466]  And a recent independent study suggests that most of our meat is already contaminated.
[02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:26.564]  Using infrared spectroscopy and electron microscopy, Dr. Ana Maria Mialcia has been studying the blood of the vaxed and the unvaxed for over a year now.
[02:03:26.564 --> 02:03:32.425]  And at first, she was finding the same contamination in only the blood of the vaxed.
[02:03:32.425 --> 02:03:40.768]  A contamination that she describes as ribbon-like structures, much like the mysterious blood clots being found by coroners.
[02:03:41.628 --> 02:03:48.215]  But lately, she's been finding these ribbon-like structures in the blood of the unvaxed as well.
[02:03:48.215 --> 02:03:59.586]  By measuring the frequency of one of these mysterious rubbery blood clots, Dr. David Jenigan has developed a way of detecting the same frequency in the vaxed.
[02:03:59.586 --> 02:04:05.852]  Recently, he's found this unique frequency in the meat being sold in his local grocery store.
[02:04:06.332 --> 02:04:10.333]  And asked Dr. Mielcia to confirm his findings.
[02:04:10.333 --> 02:04:21.277]  Her microscopy showed that the blood samples taken from products in the grocery store were all contaminated with the similar ribbon-like structures found in the blood of the vaxxed.
[02:04:22.117 --> 02:04:39.314]  Most of the meat in the grocery store is from overseas, and if we want to eat uncontaminated meat, we'll have to start buying direct from farms in America that still produce all-natural organic protein and take back control of our democidal government.
[02:04:39.314 --> 02:04:41.677]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[02:04:42.867 --> 02:04:44.548]  Could not be a more important article.
[02:04:44.548 --> 02:04:48.150]  It's at man.video on the post of the live show feed at infowares.com.
[02:04:48.150 --> 02:04:51.792]  American farmers have been injecting livestock with mRNA shots this month.
[02:04:51.792 --> 02:04:54.854]  Does nothing to help the cows, doesn't do anything except poison you.
[02:04:54.854 --> 02:04:55.794]  This is total war.
[02:04:55.794 --> 02:04:57.155]  This is Joseph Mingala, Next Level.
[02:04:58.939 --> 02:05:05.588]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[02:05:05.588 --> 02:05:07.531]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[02:05:07.531 --> 02:05:09.033]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[02:05:09.033 --> 02:05:11.836]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[02:05:11.836 --> 02:05:13.839]  And it says, political prisoner.
[02:05:14.620 --> 02:05:16.581]  With an image of President Trump.
[02:05:16.581 --> 02:05:19.022]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[02:05:19.022 --> 02:05:21.162]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[02:05:21.162 --> 02:05:26.544]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[02:05:26.544 --> 02:05:27.765]  Jail background.
[02:05:27.765 --> 02:05:28.805]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[02:05:28.805 --> 02:05:32.927]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[02:05:32.927 --> 02:05:34.547]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[02:05:34.547 --> 02:05:35.547]  No, I'm not running for President.
[02:05:35.547 --> 02:05:38.108]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[02:05:38.108 --> 02:05:38.889]  Red, white, and blue.
[02:05:38.889 --> 02:05:39.769]  Alex Jones for President.
[02:05:40.449 --> 02:05:43.290]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[02:05:43.290 --> 02:05:45.190]  Great way to fund the operation.
[02:05:45.190 --> 02:05:55.272]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:05:55.272 --> 02:06:09.675]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:16.423 --> 02:06:27.546]  I saw a report we aired yesterday where a top scientist said if Hitler had figured out how to have done everything covertly, how they're doing now, he'd have won.
[02:06:27.546 --> 02:06:40.749]  And Hitler was super evil and a horrible person, but he is a lightweight, like Floyd Waymother compared to Mike Tyson is prime.
[02:06:40.749 --> 02:06:42.290]  There's not even a comparison
[02:06:43.263 --> 02:06:45.927]  To the new world order we got today, to what we were dealing with before.
[02:06:45.927 --> 02:06:51.195]  But if we wake up, it's a mind war, and see it, it's game over.
[02:06:51.195 --> 02:06:54.059]  It's power is that it's hidden.
[02:06:54.059 --> 02:06:56.663]  It's power is that it's somewhat cloaked.
[02:06:57.625 --> 02:07:01.588]  And that's why they have to censor us is because the truth will set us free.
[02:07:01.588 --> 02:07:04.830]  Now, I'm not going to go into his pedigree, but Larry Pinckney is an amazing person.
[02:07:04.830 --> 02:07:13.896]  One of the founding members of the Black Panther Party that really sought to bring people together and stand up and empower communities and was anti-racist.
[02:07:13.896 --> 02:07:16.797]  The New Black Panther Party is just a black KKK group funded by the left.
[02:07:16.797 --> 02:07:18.398]  We all know that.
[02:07:18.398 --> 02:07:21.881]  But he's one of the best read researchers and authors out there.
[02:07:23.151 --> 02:07:27.852]  He's been a former political president, so he knows what President Trump and Roger Stone and myself are facing.
[02:07:27.852 --> 02:07:31.713]  They're trying to put me in jail right now, too.
[02:07:31.713 --> 02:07:34.114]  BlackactivistWG.org.
[02:07:34.114 --> 02:07:41.415]  He's been on my show for 20 years and never once plugged his book or plugged his site or plugged what he did.
[02:07:41.415 --> 02:07:44.136]  I wish this guy had big sponsors.
[02:07:44.136 --> 02:07:48.477]  I wish this guy had millions of dollars to form an organization and go out.
[02:07:48.477 --> 02:07:51.198]  He does interviews all the time, but our best people
[02:07:53.490 --> 02:07:57.852]  Like our prophets, like the Bible says, a prophet's not going to own his own country.
[02:07:57.852 --> 02:07:59.373]  Don't get the support they need.
[02:07:59.373 --> 02:08:02.555]  And he didn't ask for it today, but I just felt led by the Holy Spirit.
[02:08:02.555 --> 02:08:08.158]  I mean, to ask for support for Larry Pinckney, blackactivistwg.org.
[02:08:08.158 --> 02:08:09.058]  He has a little link there.
[02:08:09.058 --> 02:08:11.880]  You got to find it to make a donation.
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:16.962]  And he's there taking care of family and so much where he lives.
[02:08:16.962 --> 02:08:18.863]  But we really appreciate him joining us.
[02:08:18.863 --> 02:08:19.764]  I love Larry Pinckney.
[02:08:20.618 --> 02:08:21.558]  We're all in this together.
[02:08:21.558 --> 02:08:29.461]  So Larry, you want to get into the political assassination of Trump and the five evil tactics they're using.
[02:08:29.461 --> 02:08:36.324]  I want to talk about Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a beautiful soul and who they murdered his father when he was one of the primaries.
[02:08:37.813 --> 02:08:40.816]  And it means so much to me that he's throwing his hat in.
[02:08:40.816 --> 02:08:44.521]  And it's the time for the men and women to stand at this point.
[02:08:44.521 --> 02:08:45.922]  And you better be heard now, folks.
[02:08:45.922 --> 02:08:47.324]  There's no more time later.
[02:08:47.324 --> 02:08:48.465]  You better stand up now.
[02:08:48.465 --> 02:08:49.847]  That doesn't mean go out and be violent.
[02:08:49.847 --> 02:08:51.349]  That doesn't mean you've got all the answers.
[02:08:51.349 --> 02:08:52.650]  But you've got to pray.
[02:08:52.650 --> 02:08:53.751]  You've got to get engaged.
[02:08:53.751 --> 02:08:54.652]  You've got to speak out.
[02:08:55.580 --> 02:09:12.507]  And all of us together, many hands make light work, but my spirit, Larry, feels, and I can see it, politically, not just spiritually, not at a gut level, but also, they're launching all these attacks, they're doing all these evil things, they're doing all these things that are unpopular, the only way they get away with it is false flags, and I feel it in my gut.
[02:09:12.927 --> 02:09:19.212]  They're preparing massive terror attacks to blame the loyal American opposition, the Make America Great Again movement.
[02:09:19.212 --> 02:09:20.053]  And Trump's not perfect.
[02:09:20.053 --> 02:09:20.453]  I'm not perfect.
[02:09:20.453 --> 02:09:21.354]  You're not perfect.
[02:09:21.354 --> 02:09:26.378]  But the movement is beautiful and is unifying and is the opposite of racist.
[02:09:26.378 --> 02:09:31.041]  And that's why you've got triple the number of blacks and Hispanics voting for Trump that were before.
[02:09:31.041 --> 02:09:32.102]  The system is scared.
[02:09:32.102 --> 02:09:33.523]  They know they're dying.
[02:09:33.523 --> 02:09:35.205]  So as negative as things are, brother,
[02:09:35.925 --> 02:09:36.925]  I don't know your view.
[02:09:36.925 --> 02:09:37.545]  I respect your view.
[02:09:37.545 --> 02:09:37.905]  I want to hear it.
[02:09:37.905 --> 02:09:39.026]  But I believe we're winning.
[02:09:39.026 --> 02:09:40.106]  I see we're winning.
[02:09:40.106 --> 02:09:41.806]  But that's why we're at such a dangerous point.
[02:09:41.806 --> 02:09:43.887]  Because the enemy is so dangerous right now.
[02:09:43.887 --> 02:09:50.548]  So as negative as all this is, I want to give people hope that our ancestors have come through so much together.
[02:09:50.548 --> 02:09:51.788]  We've made so many changes.
[02:09:51.788 --> 02:09:53.228]  We've come so far.
[02:09:53.228 --> 02:09:55.669]  And they are trying to dump all that in the toilet.
[02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:56.849]  And it's not going to work.
[02:09:56.849 --> 02:09:57.569]  So I love you, brother.
[02:09:57.569 --> 02:10:01.370]  I'm going to try to shut up and give you the floor to go through all this stuff, my friend Larry Pinkney.
[02:10:03.300 --> 02:10:07.801]  My brother, first and foremost, as always, you know that I love you.
[02:10:07.801 --> 02:10:16.283]  You know that it is an honor and a privilege to be interviewed, to be supportive of InfoWars.
[02:10:16.283 --> 02:10:22.524]  I want to give my greetings, my love and my strength as well to the entire crew.
[02:10:22.524 --> 02:10:27.105]  I always try to make that point because it's very important.
[02:10:27.105 --> 02:10:31.766]  I want to give my greetings and love and strength to Owen,
[02:10:32.972 --> 02:10:38.993]  To Harrison, to Daria, to Darren McBrain, to Kellen.
[02:10:38.993 --> 02:10:48.355]  It's an endless list, and I want every last one of you all to know that you are deeply appreciated and needed.
[02:10:48.355 --> 02:10:59.658]  Now, having said that, I want to, if I may, Brother Alex, move quickly into a couple of areas that I hope people will pay close attention to.
[02:11:01.984 --> 02:11:30.318]  One, I want to begin with the five points of what I consider to be the five points, the five signs, the five tools that the Democrat in collusion with the Deep State, in fact the leadership of the Democrat Party is part of the Deep State, but in any event, number one, and not necessarily in this order, but here's the first one.
[02:11:30.318 --> 02:11:31.299]  Censorship.
[02:11:32.037 --> 02:11:35.499]  Surprise, surprise, as Goma Pau would say.
[02:11:35.499 --> 02:11:38.161]  I'm sure you're not surprised.
[02:11:38.161 --> 02:11:40.702]  Heavy censorship.
[02:11:40.702 --> 02:11:46.025]  Number two, instilling fear in the people.
[02:11:46.025 --> 02:11:48.267]  The people should not be in fear.
[02:11:48.267 --> 02:11:54.851]  We everyday ordinary black, white, brown, red, and yellow people, citizens of this country, should not be in fear.
[02:11:54.851 --> 02:11:57.172]  If anything, it's the government
[02:11:57.961 --> 02:12:02.648]  Okay, be in fear for their wrongdoing.
[02:12:02.648 --> 02:12:06.694]  Number three, disinformation.
[02:12:07.515 --> 02:12:09.776]  We get it constantly.
[02:12:09.776 --> 02:12:20.803]  Constant disinformation from this diabolical, lamestream, despicable so-called mainstream media.
[02:12:20.803 --> 02:12:24.485]  We don't have a mainstream media in this country.
[02:12:24.485 --> 02:12:30.689]  All we have is a propaganda machine media in this country.
[02:12:30.689 --> 02:12:32.510]  Number four.
[02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:33.471]  Distraction.
[02:12:34.366 --> 02:12:35.707]  Oh yes!
[02:12:35.707 --> 02:12:36.428]  They'll do it.
[02:12:36.428 --> 02:12:43.292]  When I say they, the Democrats in Deep State, and by the way, that includes RINO Republicans.
[02:12:43.292 --> 02:12:45.394]  Let us make no mistake about that.
[02:12:45.394 --> 02:12:54.180]  But distraction, distraction is a tactic that they constantly, constantly employ.
[02:12:54.180 --> 02:12:59.323]  They utilize this to try and keep us off-center, off-balance.
[02:12:59.323 --> 02:13:02.926]  Number five, false flag.
[02:13:03.809 --> 02:13:06.770]  Alex, you just mentioned that earlier.
[02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:08.230]  False flags.
[02:13:08.230 --> 02:13:16.432]  Now, you good brothers and sisters out there, you put these five elements, if you will, any way you want.
[02:13:16.432 --> 02:13:26.935]  But under these five topics, I think you will find virtually every kind of tool that they use.
[02:13:26.935 --> 02:13:31.336]  They pull from their diabolical box.
[02:13:32.133 --> 02:13:47.364]  So the other thing I want to quickly move into, because I know time is of the essence, is the political, or what I refer to as the political assassination of President Donald J. Trump.
[02:13:47.364 --> 02:13:48.285]  Okay?
[02:13:48.285 --> 02:13:56.031]  It's an assassination, or let me put it this way, it is an attempted assassination.
[02:13:56.031 --> 02:13:58.873]  That's what the deep state is all about.
[02:13:59.853 --> 02:14:09.698]  Politically discrediting and economically and politically assassinating President Trump.
[02:14:09.698 --> 02:14:10.279]  Okay?
[02:14:10.279 --> 02:14:27.388]  Nothing about Hunter Biden, nothing about Hillary Clinton, nothing about these terrible, terrible people who do and have done and continue to be protected, but who do and have done diabolical.
[02:14:28.078 --> 02:14:33.241]  We are now entering a phase of what I call COINTELPRO on steroids.
[02:14:33.241 --> 02:14:36.042]  In other words, COINTELPRO 2.0, where they
[02:14:54.085 --> 02:14:57.066]  They frame you, they discredit you, okay?
[02:14:57.066 --> 02:14:58.247]  They imprison you.
[02:14:58.247 --> 02:14:59.827]  And by the way, you're an expert on that.
[02:14:59.827 --> 02:15:02.568]  Even in congressional hearings, you're one of the main targets of this.
[02:15:02.568 --> 02:15:04.929]  So you're an expert on this.
[02:15:04.929 --> 02:15:09.891]  Yes, I do know, unfortunately, from direct personal experience.
[02:15:09.891 --> 02:15:17.614]  But I also know that if we stand together, Alex, as you said, they want us to lose hope.
[02:15:17.614 --> 02:15:20.375]  We will not lose hope.
[02:15:20.375 --> 02:15:22.576]  And not only will we not lose hope,
[02:15:23.306 --> 02:15:25.407]  We will get even stronger.
[02:15:25.407 --> 02:15:32.592]  They have used the divide and conquer tactic against us for years now.
[02:15:32.592 --> 02:15:34.193]  Enough of this.
[02:15:34.193 --> 02:15:38.196]  Any differences that we have, we will settle between ourselves.
[02:15:38.835 --> 02:15:40.775]  And this is what it's all about.
[02:15:40.775 --> 02:15:42.236]  We're going to come together.
[02:15:42.236 --> 02:15:44.176]  We're going to get our republic back.
[02:15:44.176 --> 02:15:50.638]  We're going to get it back because we have to for this republic and indeed for the entire world.
[02:15:50.638 --> 02:15:54.079]  Larry Pinkney, you're on fire as always, particularly today.
[02:15:54.079 --> 02:15:55.259]  Stay with us, my friend.
[02:15:55.259 --> 02:16:02.721]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[02:16:02.721 --> 02:16:05.001]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:16:05.001 --> 02:16:08.002]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:16:08.914 --> 02:16:17.847]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:16:17.847 --> 02:16:25.657]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:16:26.681 --> 02:16:30.283]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:16:30.283 --> 02:16:36.105]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:16:36.105 --> 02:16:38.566]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[02:16:38.566 --> 02:16:39.126]  Keep doing it.
[02:16:39.126 --> 02:16:46.189]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsTour.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[02:16:46.189 --> 02:16:47.370]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[02:16:48.010 --> 02:16:52.371]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[02:16:52.371 --> 02:16:57.313]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsaw.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:16:57.313 --> 02:16:58.713]  Please take action now.
[02:16:58.713 --> 02:17:02.875]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[02:17:02.875 --> 02:17:06.596]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[02:17:06.596 --> 02:17:08.996]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[02:17:08.996 --> 02:17:10.617]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[02:17:11.837 --> 02:17:14.738]  This is a different kind of war.
[02:17:14.738 --> 02:17:19.180]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[02:17:19.180 --> 02:17:22.562]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[02:17:22.562 --> 02:17:26.623]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[02:17:26.623 --> 02:17:29.205]  It was almost as if there were a plan in motion.
[02:17:29.205 --> 02:17:30.265]  It just can't end.
[02:17:34.503 --> 02:17:36.643]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[02:17:36.643 --> 02:17:38.243]  They are nothing but distractions.
[02:17:38.243 --> 02:17:40.464]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[02:17:40.464 --> 02:17:42.945]  You silenced those voices.
[02:17:42.945 --> 02:17:46.705]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[02:17:46.705 --> 02:17:53.067]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:09.911]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[02:18:09.911 --> 02:18:13.576]  We can't stay on air without your help, and I want to thank you all for your past support.
[02:18:13.576 --> 02:18:20.523]  And I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products at InfoWarsStore.com to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[02:18:21.064 --> 02:18:25.327]  Ultimate Bone Broth, finally sold out for over two years, back in stock.

[02:18:49.244 --> 02:18:51.665]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[02:18:51.665 --> 02:18:52.545]  We didn't have them for sale.
[02:18:52.545 --> 02:18:54.106]  But now, I signed the last books.

[02:20:12.177 --> 02:20:16.977]  Rallying patriots worldwide!
[02:20:31.727 --> 02:20:43.640]  You know, I'm bringing up the racial issue, not because Larry Pinkney's a black man, but because that's one of their main attack profiles, the transgenderism, the open borders, the collapse of the dollar, the cutting off of the energy.
[02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:45.963]  But the good news is, despite their attempt,
[02:20:47.062 --> 02:20:52.367]  With Obama betraying his pledge to create unification, create division for divide and conquer.
[02:20:52.367 --> 02:21:03.398]  We see the polls in reality show people perceive racism as worse than ever, but people are more together than ever when it comes to wanting freedom and believing in America.
[02:21:03.398 --> 02:21:06.021]  So Larry Pitney, we're getting into the political assassination of Trump.
[02:21:08.683 --> 02:21:10.144]  That this is going to fail.
[02:21:10.144 --> 02:21:14.146]  I believe they're going to try to assassinate him, which is a historical reality to deal with.
[02:21:14.146 --> 02:21:15.366]  Look at Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:21:15.366 --> 02:21:17.887]  running that killed his dad when he was winning the primaries.
[02:21:17.887 --> 02:21:23.190]  So can you speak to the political assassination of President Trump?
[02:21:23.190 --> 02:21:24.230]  Thank you, my brother.
[02:21:24.230 --> 02:21:30.053]  The political assassination of President Trump has long been in the making.
[02:21:30.053 --> 02:21:31.054]  Okay?
[02:21:31.054 --> 02:21:35.356]  Let's remember, Russiagate I, Russiagate II,
[02:21:36.503 --> 02:21:37.605]  Et cetera, et cetera.
[02:21:37.605 --> 02:21:39.788]  I use those as examples.
[02:21:39.788 --> 02:21:44.916]  All of this was about politically assassinating President Trump.
[02:21:44.916 --> 02:21:49.884]  And I pray to God that he is not physically assassinated.
[02:21:49.884 --> 02:21:50.665]  I pray to God.
[02:21:51.377 --> 02:21:52.017]  All right?
[02:21:52.017 --> 02:21:58.559]  But politically, this is why I refer to what I call COINTELPRO on steroids.
[02:21:58.559 --> 02:22:05.462]  The counterintelligence program to frame, discredit, imprison, and in many cases, to murder.
[02:22:05.462 --> 02:22:06.422]  Okay?
[02:22:06.422 --> 02:22:07.842]  And we got plenty of time, sir.
[02:22:07.842 --> 02:22:09.083]  This is a historic thing.
[02:22:09.083 --> 02:22:09.623]  It's illegal.
[02:22:09.623 --> 02:22:10.143]  It's admitted.
[02:22:10.143 --> 02:22:15.185]  I interviewed the head of the program who apologized for what he did to Martin Luther King before he died when he was dying of cancer.
[02:22:16.125 --> 02:22:17.526]  So it's a very real thing.
[02:22:17.526 --> 02:22:18.706]  Frank Church Committee hearing.
[02:22:18.706 --> 02:22:21.407]  Describe what it is, because like you said, it's on steroids.
[02:22:21.407 --> 02:22:24.468]  It's not 2.0, it's like 10.0.
[02:22:24.468 --> 02:22:25.488]  Exactly.
[02:22:25.488 --> 02:22:26.028]  Exactly.
[02:22:26.028 --> 02:22:30.030]  I'm glad you said that, because you're precisely correct.
[02:22:30.030 --> 02:22:31.070]  Okay?
[02:22:31.070 --> 02:22:35.672]  The COINTELPRO was a program that was set up by the U.S.
[02:22:35.672 --> 02:22:42.954]  government, and the aim of COINTELPRO, and please, I hope my brothers and sisters out there will listen closely.
[02:22:43.504 --> 02:22:45.666]  Because COINTELPRO still goes on.
[02:22:45.666 --> 02:22:48.148]  I don't care what name they might call it.
[02:22:48.148 --> 02:22:55.094]  The aim of COINTELPRO, okay, was to, number one, to discredit you.
[02:22:55.094 --> 02:22:56.695]  Discredit you.
[02:22:56.695 --> 02:22:59.457]  Two, to frame you.
[02:22:59.457 --> 02:23:01.699]  Three, to imprison you.
[02:23:01.699 --> 02:23:03.080]  And four,
[02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:08.132]  In many cases, to outright murder you.
[02:23:08.132 --> 02:23:10.713]  And of course, what did they say?
[02:23:10.713 --> 02:23:13.775]  Oh, well this is for the good of our country.
[02:23:13.775 --> 02:23:20.639]  No, it was a part of the destruction, the hollowing out of our country.
[02:23:20.639 --> 02:23:23.320]  And this is what we're in, you're right Alex.
[02:23:23.320 --> 02:23:26.622]  It's actually COINTELPRO 10.0.
[02:23:26.622 --> 02:23:30.344]  We, when people say, and think of this brothers and sisters,
[02:23:30.876 --> 02:23:35.460]  When people say, but we have a democracy!
[02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:37.121]  Bullcrap!
[02:23:37.121 --> 02:23:43.185]  What we have is a subversion and hypocrisy of democracy.
[02:23:43.185 --> 02:23:50.431]  I repeat, we have a subversion and hypocrisy of democracy.
[02:23:50.431 --> 02:23:52.813]  And this is what this is all about.
[02:23:52.813 --> 02:23:59.598]  Now, the assassination, political assassination of Donald J. Trump
[02:24:00.456 --> 02:24:08.585]  Of all of the, essentially, the political enemies of the deep state.
[02:24:08.585 --> 02:24:19.558]  And by the way, Alex, please let me cut off for a minute and just say I commend you for that incredible, informative interview that you did with Scott Ritter.
[02:24:20.490 --> 02:24:24.254]  He's an amazing person and his presence in person is even more.
[02:24:24.254 --> 02:24:25.255]  He's a great man.
[02:24:36.943 --> 02:24:39.704]  Great, and I thank you, I thank you for that.
[02:24:39.704 --> 02:24:43.885]  I watched it and re-watched it, and I'm sure I'm going to be watching it again.
[02:24:43.885 --> 02:25:02.852]  Anyway, getting back to what I've been trying to get across, we have, and I'm just going to be blunt about it, we have a sadistically female so-called president
[02:25:03.746 --> 02:25:04.707]  Alright?
[02:25:04.707 --> 02:25:07.328]  A part of a sadistic system.
[02:25:07.328 --> 02:25:09.049]  And I'm not exaggerating.
[02:25:09.049 --> 02:25:10.330]  You know it's true.
[02:25:10.330 --> 02:25:12.011]  So what do we do?
[02:25:12.011 --> 02:25:14.952]  When I say you, I mean all of you out there.
[02:25:14.952 --> 02:25:19.014]  And if there are folks out there that don't like what I'm saying, tough!
[02:25:19.014 --> 02:25:21.836]  Because you too are on the grinder.
[02:25:21.836 --> 02:25:29.840]  You might think you're down with it now, but in due time, if you don't stand up, you'll just be plain down.
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:30.581]  Alright?
[02:25:30.581 --> 02:25:30.701]  So,
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:35.821]  We are dealing with the fact... By the way, I don't mean to interrupt you because I want to hear what you have to say.
[02:25:35.821 --> 02:25:37.181]  You have the floor and I love you.
[02:25:37.181 --> 02:25:39.342]  But yeah, what about people that serve the system?
[02:25:39.342 --> 02:25:42.123]  I think they're getting away with it because they're working with the man.
[02:25:42.123 --> 02:25:44.823]  They are the biggest idiots ever.
[02:25:44.823 --> 02:25:45.663]  They are.
[02:25:45.663 --> 02:25:52.505]  And the fact of the matter is, is that, you know, I was I was looking at some international programs, right?
[02:25:52.505 --> 02:26:00.927]  And there's an adage or saying now that goes something and I'm paraphrasing that goes something like they don't know if it's
[02:26:01.673 --> 02:26:06.396]  Worse to be an ally of the U.S.
[02:26:06.396 --> 02:26:07.357]  or an enemy.
[02:26:07.357 --> 02:26:21.387]  In other words, working for a country that really hates its own people and other people throughout the globe and saying that we are allies
[02:26:22.709 --> 02:26:25.031]  Wow, think about that!
[02:26:25.031 --> 02:26:28.653]  What's the expression with friends like that?
[02:26:28.653 --> 02:26:30.114]  Who needs enemies?
[02:26:30.114 --> 02:26:35.077]  And that's what I would say to people who are working with the system.
[02:26:35.077 --> 02:26:36.298]  They know they are!
[02:26:36.298 --> 02:26:38.259]  They know they are, okay?
[02:26:38.259 --> 02:26:40.721]  They somehow think they will be spared.
[02:26:40.721 --> 02:26:44.303]  No, they will be among the first to go.
[02:26:44.303 --> 02:26:46.605]  Believe me, I've seen it before.
[02:26:46.605 --> 02:26:49.527]  That's right, the globalists are setting up the people that are doing this right now.
[02:26:50.751 --> 02:26:51.552]  That's right.
[02:26:51.552 --> 02:26:52.253]  That's right.
[02:26:52.253 --> 02:26:56.600]  And that's always been their game plan.
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:26:58.323]  That's what they do.
[02:26:58.323 --> 02:27:05.855]  I'm going to use the expression that people I'm sure have heard many times, but these folks are useful idiots!
[02:27:06.832 --> 02:27:12.876]  And it's time for them to wake the freak up and stop being useful idiots!
[02:27:12.876 --> 02:27:16.198]  We're dealing with de facto fascism.
[02:27:16.198 --> 02:27:19.661]  And I don't use the word fascism lightly, believe me.
[02:27:19.661 --> 02:27:20.541]  All right?
[02:27:20.541 --> 02:27:23.924]  We are dealing with de facto fascism.
[02:27:23.924 --> 02:27:33.270]  I'll give you an example of what I mean when the sadistic, hypocritical, Ku Klux Klan-loving Joe Biden
[02:27:34.212 --> 02:27:39.766]  And I quote, you ain't black if you don't vote for me, unquote.
[02:27:39.766 --> 02:27:40.507]  What was that?
[02:27:41.218 --> 02:27:44.400]  That was a fascistic statement!
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:51.965]  A statement that you would expect to hear from Benito Mussolini, or from Adolf Hitler, etc.
[02:27:51.965 --> 02:27:52.565]  Okay?
[02:27:52.565 --> 02:27:56.788]  So let's understand this, and it wasn't just about black people.
[02:27:56.788 --> 02:28:08.515]  Let me tell you, it was about dehumanizing and vilifying anyone of any color who did not agree with what?
[02:28:09.249 --> 02:28:12.973]  Joe Biden or the Deep State Democrat.
[02:28:12.973 --> 02:28:15.255]  We've got to understand this.
[02:28:15.255 --> 02:28:17.117]  We must understand it.
[02:28:17.117 --> 02:28:21.882]  And if we understand it, then we can effectively deal with it.
[02:28:21.882 --> 02:28:23.484]  And let me be clear.
[02:28:23.484 --> 02:28:25.446]  I'm not talking about violence.
[02:28:25.446 --> 02:28:26.968]  Let me repeat that.
[02:28:26.968 --> 02:28:31.052]  I'm not talking about violence because they are the violent ones.
[02:28:31.698 --> 02:28:32.498]  All right?
[02:28:32.498 --> 02:28:41.522]  Straight out of the book entitled, or titled, Reveille for Radicals, Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky.
[02:28:41.522 --> 02:28:51.446]  Straight out of that book where he says, to the left, make sure you blame them, the people, for everything that you're doing.
[02:28:51.446 --> 02:28:53.227]  Stay there, Larry Pinckney is incredible.
[02:28:53.227 --> 02:28:53.807]  Stay there, Larry.
[02:28:57.901 --> 02:29:01.354]  most banned man in America Alex Jones
[02:29:06.075 --> 02:29:07.416]  I want you all to know something.
[02:29:07.416 --> 02:29:09.378]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:29:09.378 --> 02:29:12.920]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[02:29:12.920 --> 02:29:15.863]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:29:15.863 --> 02:29:20.286]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:29:20.286 --> 02:29:22.488]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:29:22.488 --> 02:29:26.030]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:29.473]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:29:29.733 --> 02:29:32.614]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:29:32.614 --> 02:29:33.634]  Years ago.
[02:29:33.634 --> 02:29:35.715]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[02:29:35.715 --> 02:29:37.716]  Not for a second.
[02:29:37.716 --> 02:29:40.237]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:29:40.237 --> 02:29:42.697]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:29:42.697 --> 02:29:45.818]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:29:45.818 --> 02:29:50.460]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:29:58.064 --> 02:30:00.768]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[02:30:00.768 --> 02:30:05.654]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[02:30:05.654 --> 02:30:10.961]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[02:30:10.961 --> 02:30:12.824]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully...

[02:30:41.903 --> 02:30:43.224]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:30:43.224 --> 02:30:44.425]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:30:44.425 --> 02:30:46.247]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:31:08.556 --> 02:31:17.481]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:31:17.481 --> 02:31:25.265]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:31:26.309 --> 02:31:29.913]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:31:29.913 --> 02:31:35.738]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:31:35.738 --> 02:31:38.761]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:31:38.761 --> 02:31:47.709]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keep us on air.
[02:31:47.709 --> 02:31:51.093]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:51.953 --> 02:31:56.936]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to m4store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:31:56.936 --> 02:31:57.877]  Please take action now.
[02:31:57.877 --> 02:32:10.544]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border, exposing the cartels, and like coming under fire, or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals, and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[02:32:10.544 --> 02:32:12.305]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[02:32:12.305 --> 02:32:14.086]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[02:32:14.486 --> 02:32:17.287]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[02:32:17.287 --> 02:32:18.988]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[02:32:18.988 --> 02:32:21.509]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[02:32:21.509 --> 02:32:25.871]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[02:32:25.871 --> 02:32:31.574]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[02:32:31.574 --> 02:32:36.556]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[02:32:36.556 --> 02:32:39.698]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the
[02:32:39.858 --> 02:32:44.382]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.164 --> 02:33:31.282]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance rallying patriots worldwide.
[02:33:31.282 --> 02:33:33.925]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:36.835 --> 02:33:42.438]  All right, historian and author and former political president Larry Pinckney is our guest.
[02:33:42.438 --> 02:33:45.059]  Blackactivistwg.org.
[02:33:45.059 --> 02:33:45.819]  Great friend of mine.
[02:33:45.819 --> 02:33:48.581]  One of my favorite guests.
[02:33:48.581 --> 02:33:56.865]  Larry, I want you to continue for the rest of the hour and have the floor and talk about the waterfront, but you agreed with me when you came on 30 minutes ago that we are winning.
[02:33:58.021 --> 02:33:59.581]  And I know you wouldn't disagree with me.
[02:33:59.581 --> 02:34:06.963]  I want you to elaborate on that, because as serious and scary as things are, I want people to know that the real indicators are not just here, but worldwide.
[02:34:06.963 --> 02:34:08.423]  Humanity's waking up.
[02:34:08.423 --> 02:34:08.943]  And I'll say it.
[02:34:08.943 --> 02:34:11.244]  The American empire is evil.
[02:34:11.244 --> 02:34:12.924]  It's exploited us.
[02:34:12.924 --> 02:34:13.844]  It's enslaved us.
[02:34:13.844 --> 02:34:15.204]  I'll talk about that more in a moment.
[02:34:15.204 --> 02:34:19.105]  But Saudi Arabia's leader said, I don't care about the US.
[02:34:19.105 --> 02:34:20.506]  I'm going with China and Russia.
[02:34:20.506 --> 02:34:23.946]  Everybody's leaving the dollar.
[02:34:23.946 --> 02:34:27.587]  As bad as that is, at some point, somebody's got to call the bluff.
[02:34:29.153 --> 02:34:32.736]  Of the people pushing World War 3.
[02:34:32.736 --> 02:34:36.319]  And so, folks need to know though, the Deep State's not going to give up now.
[02:34:36.319 --> 02:34:37.140]  They're going to double down.
[02:34:37.140 --> 02:34:43.304]  So I want you to speak to, like a football coach, or like Steve Madden, once he wasn't a coach.
[02:34:43.304 --> 02:34:45.166]  You're up there in the box at the Super Bowl.
[02:34:45.166 --> 02:34:47.508]  You're calling the game at halftime.
[02:34:47.508 --> 02:34:49.109]  How'd the game go in the first half?
[02:34:49.109 --> 02:34:51.291]  What do you think is about to happen in the next half?
[02:34:51.291 --> 02:34:53.012]  Because I want to get your 35,000 foot view.
[02:34:56.232 --> 02:35:03.295]  What I think, my brother, what I know will happen in the second half is that we will double down.
[02:35:03.295 --> 02:35:04.776]  We, the people.
[02:35:04.776 --> 02:35:07.957]  How do I know that we are in fact winning?
[02:35:07.957 --> 02:35:10.238]  How do I know that?
[02:35:10.238 --> 02:35:20.483]  I know this because if we were not winning, they wouldn't be, the Deep State, the Democrats, the Rhino Republicans, they wouldn't be doubling down.
[02:35:21.320 --> 02:35:27.001]  Because there'd be no reason, no incentive, no motive for them to double down.
[02:35:27.001 --> 02:35:36.363]  We are not only winning, we are getting ready and in the process of what I call flipping the script.
[02:35:36.363 --> 02:35:42.344]  In other words, the narrative is sort of like the Russiagate narrative.
[02:35:42.344 --> 02:35:44.964]  Oh, Trump is a Russian spy!
[02:35:44.964 --> 02:35:50.625]  These narratives are going to be flipped on their head by us.
[02:35:51.485 --> 02:36:03.537]  And the so-called media, what I call the propaganda machine, and when I say media I'm talking about the so-called mainstream media, alright?
[02:36:03.537 --> 02:36:10.804]  They are going to be, and in fact are being, exposed!
[02:36:10.804 --> 02:36:13.967]  Now, this is not happening by osmosis.
[02:36:14.853 --> 02:36:19.397]  This is a serious, serious political movement.
[02:36:19.397 --> 02:36:30.546]  And each and every one of you, all my brothers and sisters in that audience, are a part of this movement.
[02:36:30.546 --> 02:36:37.372]  What they want to do to us is to basically make us feel that we are alone.
[02:36:37.372 --> 02:36:40.915]  I've said this before, I will say it again.
[02:36:40.915 --> 02:36:42.957]  We are not alone.
[02:36:43.903 --> 02:36:52.867]  We are in the massive majority, and it's time for us to understand that, and link up together, and work together.
[02:36:52.867 --> 02:36:59.610]  And this is where our power lies, and you better damn well believe that the Deep State
[02:37:01.883 --> 02:37:05.646]  I agree.
[02:37:05.646 --> 02:37:08.728]  Let me add this point.
[02:37:08.728 --> 02:37:10.890]  Say Elon's good, bad, whatever.
[02:37:10.890 --> 02:37:14.893]  He sounds like Larry Payton or Alex Jones or Tucker Carlson now.
[02:37:14.893 --> 02:37:16.935]  He knows where it's going, whether he's good or bad.
[02:37:18.564 --> 02:37:23.207]  I don't want to be over optimistic because I'm actually concerned what the deep state will do because they know they're losing.
[02:37:23.207 --> 02:37:25.068]  They are getting their asses kicked.
[02:37:25.068 --> 02:37:32.072]  I mean, it's all stuff we battled, you 40, 50 years ago, me in the last 29 years, that nobody knew.
[02:37:32.072 --> 02:37:34.073]  I read your stuff you wrote 30 years ago.
[02:37:34.073 --> 02:37:36.454]  You've been more visionary than I have been.
[02:37:36.454 --> 02:37:38.095]  It's all mainstream now.
[02:37:38.095 --> 02:37:41.117]  I mean, we don't really, I don't think we recognize how far we've come.
[02:37:42.918 --> 02:37:44.038]  That's true.
[02:37:44.038 --> 02:37:53.321]  And the fact is that we must make sure that everyone, or as many as possible, recognizes.
[02:37:53.321 --> 02:38:04.805]  We have struggled and struggled and struggled, but we're now reaching a line where there absolutely is no turning back.
[02:38:04.805 --> 02:38:07.286]  These deep state liars
[02:38:08.246 --> 02:38:10.968]  These, these, these, I don't even want to go there.
[02:38:10.968 --> 02:38:13.349]  They want to kill us!
[02:38:13.349 --> 02:38:15.591]  There's no ifs, ands, and buts about it.
[02:38:15.591 --> 02:38:21.875]  They want to kill us mentally, spiritually, and physically.
[02:38:21.875 --> 02:38:31.922]  And once we understand that, then we know how to deal with these, and I'm going to use the S-C-U-M word, SCUM!
[02:38:32.785 --> 02:38:34.766]  Because that is what they are.
[02:38:34.766 --> 02:38:36.666]  And we recognize them.
[02:38:36.666 --> 02:38:43.309]  What they're trying to do to our families, to our children, to our loved ones.
[02:38:43.309 --> 02:38:45.090]  Only scum does that.
[02:38:45.090 --> 02:38:53.993]  And they do that in the name of democracy, which is, as I said, nothing more than a hypocrisy of democracy.
[02:38:53.993 --> 02:38:55.353]  That's what we're living in.
[02:38:55.353 --> 02:38:58.575]  A hypocrisy of democracy.
[02:38:58.575 --> 02:39:01.856]  So, the more people wake up to that,
[02:39:02.463 --> 02:39:09.328]  And the more people resist that, and I mean seriously resist that, the stronger we become.
[02:39:09.328 --> 02:39:11.009]  I was about to say, it's plain resistance.
[02:39:11.009 --> 02:39:13.671]  It's like jogging or hiking or lifting.
[02:39:13.671 --> 02:39:18.274]  As long as we keep resisting like the Vietnamese, we get stronger.
[02:39:18.274 --> 02:39:18.975]  We can't be stopped.
[02:39:20.222 --> 02:39:21.622]  That's right, that's right.
[02:39:21.622 --> 02:39:25.944]  And resistance is not futile, huh?
[02:39:25.944 --> 02:39:27.904]  It is not futile.
[02:39:27.904 --> 02:39:32.325]  I've heard the sci-fi expression, resistance is futile.
[02:39:32.325 --> 02:39:37.187]  To the contrary, resistance is essential.
[02:39:37.187 --> 02:39:46.609]  Resistance is the only thing that will, in fact, stop this outright repression.
[02:39:46.609 --> 02:39:48.870]  Look, if you had told me Alex
[02:39:49.637 --> 02:39:51.598]  Oh, even ten years ago.
[02:39:51.598 --> 02:40:04.522]  Even just ten years ago, that we would wreak in this country such a fascistic state, I would have scratched my head and said, I hope not.
[02:40:04.522 --> 02:40:09.384]  But the reality is, we are in the thick of defacto fascism.
[02:40:09.384 --> 02:40:15.226]  But it's what you said, we forced them to take the mask off, and what you just said, resistance is victory.
[02:40:16.653 --> 02:40:17.653]  That's right.
[02:40:17.653 --> 02:40:20.414]  Resistance is victory.
[02:40:20.414 --> 02:40:29.938]  And if we understand that, that in and of itself gives us that necessary strength to continue, to push, to continue.
[02:40:29.938 --> 02:40:34.079]  They have taken the mask off because they had no choice.
[02:40:34.079 --> 02:40:38.521]  And that's thanks to you, Alex, and so many others.
[02:40:38.521 --> 02:40:41.022]  And I give you your kudos, my brother.
[02:40:41.022 --> 02:40:42.562]  I give you your kudos.
[02:40:42.562 --> 02:40:44.683]  And I give the brothers and sisters out there
[02:40:45.365 --> 02:40:47.367]  We're listening to us!
[02:40:47.367 --> 02:40:49.108]  I give them their kudos.
[02:40:49.108 --> 02:40:52.290]  And I say, let's gird our hips!
[02:40:52.290 --> 02:40:54.752]  Let's reinvigorate ourselves!
[02:40:54.752 --> 02:40:57.594]  Let's fight for this republic!
[02:40:57.594 --> 02:40:58.114]  So I agree.
[02:40:58.114 --> 02:41:00.596]  So it's like George Foreman and Muhammad Ali.
[02:41:00.596 --> 02:41:05.019]  It's evenly matched, but Muhammad Ali in the last couple rounds is winning.
[02:41:05.019 --> 02:41:08.141]  We have to know that this is time to like totally commit.
[02:41:08.141 --> 02:41:08.742]  How do we commit?
[02:41:10.934 --> 02:41:16.697]  One of the things that we must do, and this may sound, I don't know how it will sound, I'll just say it.
[02:41:16.697 --> 02:41:23.020]  One of the things that we must do is we must not be afraid to speak out.
[02:41:23.020 --> 02:41:23.580]  Speak out!
[02:41:24.932 --> 02:41:28.613]  You know, with each other, do not be afraid.
[02:41:28.613 --> 02:41:41.636]  We must stop accepting... I saw an ad just a few minutes ago that you have out, that InfoWars has out, and the young man was saying, do not leave this television.
[02:41:41.636 --> 02:41:43.316]  Well, that's the whole point!
[02:41:43.316 --> 02:41:44.777]  Turn it off!
[02:41:44.777 --> 02:41:45.917]  Turn it off!
[02:41:45.917 --> 02:41:50.358]  Learn to live in such a way that you have a freedom to think!
[02:41:51.212 --> 02:41:53.533]  Think for God's sake, alright?
[02:41:53.533 --> 02:41:55.534]  Be a critical thinker.
[02:41:55.534 --> 02:41:56.734]  Come together.
[02:41:56.734 --> 02:42:01.176]  Stop going for the ghost, as we used to say back in the day in the 60s.
[02:42:01.176 --> 02:42:05.437]  Stop going for the ghost!
[02:42:05.437 --> 02:42:09.099]  99.9% of what the government tells you is a lie!
[02:42:09.099 --> 02:42:10.859]  I don't care how they wrap it.
[02:42:10.859 --> 02:42:15.781]  And once we understand that, we become invincible.
[02:42:15.781 --> 02:42:18.202]  And invincible we must become.
[02:42:19.318 --> 02:42:21.261]  And I don't want to sit there and lie to the listeners.
[02:42:21.261 --> 02:42:26.007]  We're in deep trouble and the enemy's bad, but I got to be honest, we are kicking ass.
[02:42:26.007 --> 02:42:27.429]  All of you are kicking ass.
[02:42:27.429 --> 02:42:28.210]  I love you all.
[02:42:28.210 --> 02:42:29.252]  You're an amazing moment.
[02:42:29.252 --> 02:42:31.334]  Larry Pinckney, final segment, 11 minutes long.
[02:42:31.334 --> 02:42:36.802]  I want to give you the floor, talk about solutions, the world, any other topics you want to talk about, World War III, all of Larry Pinckney.
[02:42:37.282 --> 02:42:40.765]  Everybody should go to blackactivistwg.org.
[02:42:40.765 --> 02:42:44.368]  He didn't ask for this, but man, this guy needs support.
[02:42:44.368 --> 02:42:45.849]  He used to be traveling the country.
[02:42:45.849 --> 02:42:48.491]  Go to that website, give him a donation, blackactivistwg.org.
[02:42:48.491 --> 02:42:58.199]  We'll be right back, final segment.
[02:42:58.199 --> 02:43:01.502]  Most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[02:43:06.363 --> 02:43:07.704]  I want you all to know something.
[02:43:07.704 --> 02:43:09.665]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:43:09.665 --> 02:43:13.188]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[02:43:13.188 --> 02:43:16.130]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:43:16.130 --> 02:43:20.573]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:43:20.573 --> 02:43:22.775]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:43:22.775 --> 02:43:26.317]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:43:26.317 --> 02:43:29.760]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:43:30.020 --> 02:43:32.901]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:43:32.901 --> 02:43:33.921]  Years ago.
[02:43:33.921 --> 02:43:38.003]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[02:43:38.003 --> 02:43:40.524]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:43:40.524 --> 02:43:42.984]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:43:42.984 --> 02:43:46.105]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:43:46.105 --> 02:43:50.747]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:04.342]  This is their big move.
[02:44:04.342 --> 02:44:08.125]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[02:44:08.125 --> 02:44:09.827]  He doesn't care.
[02:44:09.827 --> 02:44:11.088]  That's not his job.
[02:44:11.088 --> 02:44:12.829]  He's not the President of the United States.
[02:44:12.829 --> 02:44:16.692]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[02:44:16.692 --> 02:44:21.196]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[02:44:21.196 --> 02:44:22.317]  They must be opposed.
[02:44:22.915 --> 02:44:26.336]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[02:44:26.336 --> 02:44:27.536]  No.
[02:44:27.536 --> 02:44:28.357]  No.
[02:44:28.357 --> 02:44:29.137]  No.
[02:44:29.137 --> 02:44:30.017]  Exactly.
[02:44:30.017 --> 02:44:33.598]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[02:44:33.598 --> 02:44:36.699]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[02:44:36.699 --> 02:44:39.179]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[02:44:39.179 --> 02:44:41.680]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[02:44:41.680 --> 02:44:45.281]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[02:44:45.281 --> 02:44:47.802]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[02:44:47.802 --> 02:44:48.222]  You're right!
[02:44:48.502 --> 02:44:53.244]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[02:44:53.244 --> 02:44:58.967]  And we say no to your war!
[02:44:58.967 --> 02:44:59.428]  Right now.
[02:45:00.563 --> 02:45:10.970]  I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to mfullerstore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[02:45:10.970 --> 02:45:19.335]  I am humbly, hand-in-hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of you for years, and never gone to mfullerstore.com.
[02:45:19.335 --> 02:45:27.821]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to mfullerstore.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[02:45:28.101 --> 02:45:31.163]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[02:45:31.163 --> 02:45:32.544]  That's great, and I thank you.
[02:45:32.544 --> 02:45:34.064]  But we need funds to operate.
[02:45:34.064 --> 02:45:42.429]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our Fizzy Magnesium, and our Sleep Aid, and our Nitric Oxide, and our Real Red Pill.
[02:45:42.429 --> 02:45:45.371]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[02:45:45.371 --> 02:45:47.152]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[02:45:47.152 --> 02:45:56.057]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:45:58.935 --> 02:46:07.126]  I intend to take the InfoWars armored truck out, or the InfoWars tank as it's so lovingly called.
[02:46:07.126 --> 02:46:11.572]  You came through yesterday and shopped at InfoWarsStore.com, so I'm going to be able to take the truck out.
[02:46:58.570 --> 02:47:03.214]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:03.214 --> 02:47:13.923]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:13.923 --> 02:47:22.490]  At the end of the last hour, I aired a short, minute-long clip of Ho-Tip Tease, a very popular talk show host.
[02:47:24.285 --> 02:47:29.648]  A businessman talking about breaking with mainstream TV, and we all get that in this main audience.
[02:47:29.648 --> 02:47:31.169]  But new people are tuning in every minute.
[02:47:31.169 --> 02:47:35.151]  And you've really got to understand, you shouldn't watch it unless you know it's a weapon.
[02:47:35.151 --> 02:47:38.053]  Then you can watch it and analyze it and it's still very depressing.
[02:47:38.053 --> 02:47:42.036]  I would suggest watch independent media and share clips to your own research to do that.
[02:47:42.036 --> 02:47:44.918]  But since Larry Pinckney mentioned it, here's this short hoax up Jesus clip.
[02:47:45.819 --> 02:47:46.799]  Stop watching TV.
[02:47:46.799 --> 02:47:47.519]  You got to turn it off.
[02:47:47.519 --> 02:47:49.000]  There's nothing on that TV.
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.620]  The TV has been completely compromised.
[02:47:51.620 --> 02:47:54.921]  Everything that comes out of that TV has been compromised.
[02:47:54.921 --> 02:47:57.862]  The TV is for conscious folk only.
[02:47:57.862 --> 02:48:08.444]  If you are not conscious and you're not watching TV with a conscious mind, meaning you're not seeing the propaganda and agendas in your TV shows and your TV content and Netflix, whatever it is,
[02:48:09.184 --> 02:48:11.204]  Put it down because you're probably being brainwashed.
[02:48:11.204 --> 02:48:15.205]  When you look at TV, you need to be able to pick it apart.
[02:48:15.205 --> 02:48:21.686]  Look at the shows you're watching and try to figure out what type of conditioning are they trying to promote?
[02:48:21.686 --> 02:48:25.007]  What type of conditioning are they pushing on my children?
[02:48:25.007 --> 02:48:27.868]  What type of conditioning are they pushing on my family?
[02:48:27.868 --> 02:48:28.748]  What's their agenda?
[02:48:28.748 --> 02:48:31.488]  Because there's an agenda in all these shows.
[02:48:31.488 --> 02:48:34.989]  All right, so Larry Pinckney, I want to give you the floor in the final 10 minutes, but I want to just say this first.
[02:48:35.851 --> 02:48:36.793]  I respect your view.
[02:48:36.793 --> 02:48:41.500]  You're one of the people I really know is in the zeitgeist.
[02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:47.810]  You like to look forward and be positive, but let's talk about negative and then get into anything else you want to cover.
[02:48:47.810 --> 02:48:49.333]  If we don't defeat these people,
[02:48:50.347 --> 02:48:51.528]  It's pretty clear what they're going to do.
[02:48:51.528 --> 02:48:54.750]  I mean, this is genocidal.
[02:48:54.750 --> 02:48:56.130]  There was two global sluts in a room.
[02:48:56.130 --> 02:48:57.011]  They tried to kill each other.
[02:48:57.011 --> 02:49:04.115]  I mean, we have a responsibility, but it's also we've been given consciousness and have been made alive by God.
[02:49:04.115 --> 02:49:05.536]  This is really what we're meant to do.
[02:49:05.536 --> 02:49:06.776]  This is our mission.
[02:49:06.776 --> 02:49:09.738]  And if we don't do it, then we're obsolete.
[02:49:09.738 --> 02:49:11.819]  What is the enemy going to do if we don't stand against them?
[02:49:11.819 --> 02:49:12.780]  And then how do we stand against them?
[02:49:14.195 --> 02:49:18.377]  Well, first and foremost, yes, I totally concur with you, my brother.
[02:49:18.377 --> 02:49:26.861]  The enemy has but one thing to do, and that is to destroy, destroy, destroy.
[02:49:26.861 --> 02:49:39.206]  And I'm talking about, it's like the five points that I mentioned at the beginning of the segment, and that is, we have to, if once we understand what we're up against,
[02:49:39.821 --> 02:49:49.264]  And stop fooling ourselves, and stop sticking our heads in the sand, then as difficult and dangerous as it may be,
[02:49:50.425 --> 02:49:52.086]  We can and will succeed.
[02:49:52.086 --> 02:49:53.566]  Now this is not easy!
[02:49:53.566 --> 02:50:01.849]  Look at what they're doing to the people who were engaging in their constitutional rights on January 6th, huh?
[02:50:01.849 --> 02:50:04.010]  What happened to the Constitution?
[02:50:04.010 --> 02:50:04.791]  What happened?
[02:50:04.791 --> 02:50:10.013]  So I'm not sitting here trying to be Pollyanna, saying, oh, it's just fine.
[02:50:10.013 --> 02:50:12.193]  No, it is dangerous.
[02:50:12.193 --> 02:50:13.094]  It is hard.
[02:50:13.094 --> 02:50:14.654]  But guess what?
[02:50:14.654 --> 02:50:18.536]  It's going to get worse if we don't do something about it now.
[02:50:18.536 --> 02:50:18.836]  Right now.
[02:50:19.847 --> 02:50:27.854]  So, I want to be both positive and pragmatic.
[02:50:27.854 --> 02:50:32.057]  The two P's, positive and pragmatic.
[02:50:32.057 --> 02:50:37.341]  Pragmatically speaking, we have to know what we're up against!
[02:50:37.341 --> 02:50:43.967]  And these are, I keep saying this, people will probably shake their head and, uh, he's going off on the deep end, but I keep saying it.
[02:50:44.784 --> 02:50:51.788]  We are dealing with 21st century de facto fascists!
[02:50:51.788 --> 02:50:53.769]  For crying out loud!
[02:50:53.769 --> 02:50:55.951]  I don't care how they decorate it.
[02:50:55.951 --> 02:50:57.592]  They are fascists!
[02:50:57.592 --> 02:50:59.333]  We don't have a democracy!
[02:50:59.333 --> 02:51:06.137]  Once we understand that... It's a corporate alliance with government for consolidation and control, censorship and persecution.
[02:51:06.137 --> 02:51:07.718]  It's fascism.
[02:51:07.718 --> 02:51:09.098]  That's fascism!
[02:51:09.098 --> 02:51:11.100]  That's exactly what fascism is!
[02:51:12.307 --> 02:51:20.807]  So once we understand it, but let me, let me, once we understand it, we are, we have the incentive, no matter what.
[02:51:21.556 --> 02:51:26.378]  Because there's no way out but resisting.
[02:51:26.378 --> 02:51:27.479]  They're not going to go away.
[02:51:27.479 --> 02:51:28.819]  We don't have a choice.
[02:51:28.819 --> 02:51:29.700]  That's right.
[02:51:29.700 --> 02:51:30.640]  That's right.
[02:51:30.640 --> 02:51:34.422]  And you know, it's sort of like what's happening right now.
[02:51:34.422 --> 02:51:39.804]  We're moving second by second to nuclear holocaust.
[02:51:39.804 --> 02:51:41.965]  I did not say nuclear war.
[02:51:41.965 --> 02:51:45.587]  Because if there's a nuclear exchange, it won't be a war.
[02:51:45.587 --> 02:51:48.828]  It will be a planetary holocaust.
[02:51:49.836 --> 02:52:01.104]  And in the sense that we, citizens of this republic, citizens of this republic, are facing the same thing, parenthetically!
[02:52:01.104 --> 02:52:04.066]  We're facing the same thing!
[02:52:04.066 --> 02:52:12.152]  Only this holocaust is a holocaust prior to any nuclear, which, God knows, I hope we don't.
[02:52:12.152 --> 02:52:16.015]  I hope we don't reach the point where we destroy our planet.
[02:52:16.613 --> 02:52:17.133]  All right?
[02:52:17.133 --> 02:52:35.121]  But I'm saying to everyone out there listening, we have already reached the point, that point, in a parenthetical sense, here in this republic, because that's all these demonic, diabolical, lying pieces of scum know!
[02:52:35.121 --> 02:52:36.322]  They know nothing else!
[02:52:37.150 --> 02:53:01.548]  So, we must do everything we can, one, to stop the Holocaust that's happening right now and right here in this Republic, and two, okay, to make sure that our planet, alright, is not led to nuclear holocaust by these blood-sucking lunatic liars.
[02:53:01.548 --> 02:53:04.831]  I mean, please, I'm asking you to stand up
[02:53:05.461 --> 02:53:08.047]  Stand up while there's still time.
[02:53:08.047 --> 02:53:14.743]  And I want to commend and thank all of you, all right, who are doing this.
[02:53:15.706 --> 02:53:18.247]  Get others to do the same thing.
[02:53:18.247 --> 02:53:26.231]  Remind them that it's not just their lives at stake, it's the lives of their children, their grandchildren, their spouse, their family members.
[02:53:26.231 --> 02:53:26.591]  That's right.
[02:53:26.591 --> 02:53:29.533]  We're not just watching TV and responding to that.
[02:53:29.533 --> 02:53:30.373]  We are active.
[02:53:30.373 --> 02:53:31.734]  We are powerful.
[02:53:31.734 --> 02:53:33.575]  We have an effect on this world.
[02:53:33.575 --> 02:53:35.416]  Let me ask you this then.
[02:53:35.416 --> 02:53:38.417]  What would the world look like if the enemy has its way?
[02:53:38.417 --> 02:53:39.478]  I think you said it.
[02:53:39.478 --> 02:53:40.278]  Nuclear holocaust.
[02:53:40.278 --> 02:53:41.019]  They love death.
[02:53:41.019 --> 02:53:41.939]  They love destruction.
[02:53:41.939 --> 02:53:43.160]  It's like a moth to flame.
[02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:46.923]  And you go back to Trump, say what you want about him.
[02:53:46.923 --> 02:53:51.967]  They hate him because he actually tried to be the president and take the power from them.
[02:53:51.967 --> 02:53:54.709]  What is your advice to Trump?
[02:53:54.709 --> 02:53:55.830]  My advice to Trump?
[02:53:55.830 --> 02:53:59.333]  First, let me salute President Trump.
[02:53:59.333 --> 02:54:04.137]  I don't necessarily agree with everything, but I don't necessarily, you know, I grow.
[02:54:04.137 --> 02:54:05.739]  We all evolve.
[02:54:05.739 --> 02:54:06.660]  All right?
[02:54:06.660 --> 02:54:09.182]  And I salute you, Mr. Trump.
[02:54:09.779 --> 02:54:14.283]  I salute you for all that you have done and what you have tried to do.
[02:54:14.283 --> 02:54:17.766]  You have my salutations for what it's worth.
[02:54:17.766 --> 02:54:18.907]  All right?
[02:54:18.907 --> 02:54:26.233]  My advice is to continue to fight, but to bring in, bring in as many people as you can.
[02:54:26.233 --> 02:54:34.480]  My advice is, as far as the whole COVID thing, come on!
[02:54:34.480 --> 02:54:35.841]  Say what has to be said!
[02:54:35.841 --> 02:54:37.022]  Be honest about it!
[02:54:37.956 --> 02:54:47.264]  And I believe in my heart of hearts that you, Mr. Trump, are, in a very basic sense, extremely honest.
[02:54:47.264 --> 02:54:51.168]  Which is also one of the reasons that these fascists hate you.
[02:54:51.168 --> 02:55:01.177]  They hate you because you were going to take away, as Dr. Paul Craig Roberts said, you were going to take away their boogeyman, Russia!
[02:55:01.177 --> 02:55:02.738]  You were saying, wait a minute!
[02:55:03.314 --> 02:55:09.836]  Whether we like each other or not, there's gotta be a way that we can peacefully coexist.
[02:55:09.836 --> 02:55:22.141]  So what I say to you, Mr. Trump, President Trump, the real president, is keep on fighting, keep on struggling, keep on standing up.
[02:55:23.015 --> 02:55:26.257]  Alright, they're going to attack you every way they can.
[02:55:26.257 --> 02:55:31.780]  But you're going to have such an army, and I'm not talking about violent.
[02:55:31.780 --> 02:55:32.141]  No, I agree.
[02:55:32.141 --> 02:55:33.501]  That was my next question.
[02:55:33.501 --> 02:55:34.642]  I agree, he's stronger than ever.
[02:55:34.642 --> 02:55:35.503]  He's not backing down.
[02:55:35.503 --> 02:55:37.424]  Why would they make such a reckless move?
[02:55:37.424 --> 02:55:40.205]  What do you expect to happen now?
[02:55:40.205 --> 02:55:44.288]  You know, at this point, I really, and I hate to say this,
[02:55:45.157 --> 02:55:55.905]  But I really would not be surprised if these deep state lunatic actually tried to physically move on President Trump.
[02:55:55.905 --> 02:55:56.666]  I agree.
[02:55:56.666 --> 02:55:59.268]  It wouldn't surprise me.
[02:55:59.268 --> 02:56:06.373]  They killed Robert Kennedy Jr., they killed Martin Luther King, they killed Malcolm X. When they can't push a man to bow, they kill him.
[02:56:06.373 --> 02:56:06.914]  Right.
[02:56:06.914 --> 02:56:11.117]  So, you know, and remember, it's all of us.
[02:56:11.117 --> 02:56:12.798]  Not just President Trump.
[02:56:12.798 --> 02:56:13.579]  It's all of us.
[02:56:15.643 --> 02:56:18.846]  We will not allow that to happen.
[02:56:18.846 --> 02:56:23.269]  And God knows, I hope that President Trump continues strong.
[02:56:23.269 --> 02:56:24.770]  Let me ask this question.
[02:56:24.770 --> 02:56:27.712]  If they're dumb enough to kill him, what happens then?
[02:56:27.712 --> 02:56:29.834]  Oh my God.
[02:56:29.834 --> 02:56:32.596]  All bets are off, my brother.
[02:56:32.596 --> 02:56:34.137]  All bets are off.
[02:56:34.137 --> 02:56:37.260]  Because these are desperate, desperate people.
[02:56:37.260 --> 02:56:39.181]  But you know what?
[02:56:39.181 --> 02:56:43.724]  You never want to bring about the rage and anger of
[02:56:44.990 --> 02:56:45.551]  Thank you.
[02:56:45.551 --> 02:56:47.472]  I love you too, my brother.
[02:57:13.755 --> 02:57:15.376]  You don't get any shredder than that.
[02:57:15.376 --> 02:57:16.877]  Larry Pinckney, a true American.
[02:57:16.877 --> 02:57:20.239]  The real deal, folks.
[02:57:20.239 --> 02:57:23.822]  That's what this show's all about, is the real deal.
[02:57:23.822 --> 02:57:26.523]  You only want authenticity.
[02:57:26.523 --> 02:57:28.765]  I hate Bill Gates, but he's authentic evil.
[02:57:28.765 --> 02:57:31.687]  Larry Pinckney's authentic good, and so are you, the listeners.
[02:57:31.687 --> 02:57:33.548]  All right, Jay Dyer's taking over.
[02:57:33.548 --> 02:57:35.249]  I'll do five more minutes before he takes over.
[02:57:35.249 --> 02:57:37.651]  That was a powerful hour.
[02:57:38.624 --> 02:57:40.285]  Millions just saw it and heard it.
[02:57:40.285 --> 02:57:48.508]  But it's only up to you to go to VanDawgVideo and share it once it's posted.
[02:57:48.508 --> 02:57:54.751]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[02:57:58.157 --> 02:58:04.080]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for President 2024 shirt.
[02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:06.501]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[02:58:06.501 --> 02:58:07.842]  This is an idea the crew had.
[02:58:07.842 --> 02:58:10.483]  I have a triggering shirt, kind of next level.
[02:58:10.483 --> 02:58:11.724]  Alex Jones is right.
[02:58:11.724 --> 02:58:16.086]  There's Infowars.com on the back, Alex Jones for President 2024 on the front.
[02:58:16.086 --> 02:58:17.127]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[02:58:17.127 --> 02:58:18.408]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[02:58:18.408 --> 02:58:19.748]  It's high quality.
[02:58:19.748 --> 02:58:23.150]  And it is a exclusive shirt to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:23.150 --> 02:58:24.991]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[02:58:24.991 --> 02:58:26.112]  We're doing one run.
[02:58:27.072 --> 02:58:37.801]  ...of Alex Jones for President 2024 shirts and we'll have a historic memento, be able to spread the word, meet a lot of like-minded people, and you'll be able to keep us on the air.
[02:58:37.801 --> 02:58:38.922]  No way!
[02:58:38.922 --> 02:58:39.182]  No way!
[02:58:39.182 --> 02:58:40.483]  That's a bridge too far!
[02:58:40.483 --> 02:58:42.245]  That's no, it can't be!
[02:58:42.245 --> 02:58:44.246]  And I said on national television that he was gonna win.
[02:58:48.891 --> 02:58:52.032]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:58:52.032 --> 02:58:54.332]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:58:54.332 --> 02:58:58.273]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:58:58.273 --> 02:59:07.196]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:59:07.196 --> 02:59:14.978]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:59:16.016 --> 02:59:18.898]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:59:18.898 --> 02:59:25.441]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:59:25.441 --> 02:59:28.482]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:59:28.482 --> 02:59:36.707]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:59:37.347 --> 02:59:41.709]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[02:59:41.709 --> 02:59:46.651]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsaw.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:59:46.651 --> 02:59:50.673]  Please take action now.
[02:59:50.673 --> 02:59:54.595]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:07.702 --> 03:00:10.703]  Here we are on Friday, April 7th, 2023.
[03:00:10.703 --> 03:00:16.744]  I'm about to hand the baton to the great researcher and author, Jay Dyer.
[03:00:16.744 --> 03:00:20.745]  Tell us what's coming up here in a moment.
[03:00:20.745 --> 03:00:25.366]  But as I've said a thousand times, we're not in beta anymore.
[03:00:25.366 --> 03:00:28.167]  We're in operational New World Order.
[03:00:29.830 --> 03:00:31.913]  And they want the future.
[03:00:31.913 --> 03:00:33.935]  They want the technology humans are able to build.
[03:00:33.935 --> 03:00:36.137]  They want to get rid of most of us.
[03:00:36.137 --> 03:00:40.682]  And you've just got to understand this isn't one of the thousand flavors of political movements.
[03:00:41.601 --> 03:00:48.264]  This show and what we do is under attack because we know what we're talking about and we're on target.
[03:00:48.264 --> 03:00:53.246]  And that means all our guests, the millions of listeners, all of us are a family.
[03:00:53.246 --> 03:00:57.988]  Black, white, old, young, Hispanic, Asian, doesn't matter.
[03:00:57.988 --> 03:01:09.233]  We are all under attack and we have to understand that and know that and be aware of that and realize that a really evil force that wants to control the future
[03:01:10.819 --> 03:01:15.402]  It's not in full control, but it's trying to get full control right now.
[03:01:15.402 --> 03:01:19.966]  So I cannot stress to you enough how precious this time is.
[03:01:19.966 --> 03:01:29.073]  Now the good news is, 10 years ago, I could count on one hand prominent people that had a big audience talking about this.
[03:01:29.073 --> 03:01:34.677]  Now I try to think about it, it's thousands of people that have prominent, huge million person audiences.
[03:01:34.677 --> 03:01:37.199]  And there are millions of people that have audiences, hundreds of thousands.
[03:01:38.363 --> 03:01:41.946]  And what we're talking about is now the mainstream discussion.
[03:01:41.946 --> 03:01:48.232]  So we've moved the ball a long way, but we haven't won yet.
[03:01:48.232 --> 03:01:58.521]  We have to build an alternative future and an alternative plan for humanity that people need to then accept and dial into.
[03:01:58.521 --> 03:02:01.024]  We can't just oppose the New World Order.
[03:02:01.024 --> 03:02:02.265]  We've got to have a plan
[03:02:03.561 --> 03:02:07.644]  That the people can see that they can join or hear what their plan is.
[03:02:07.644 --> 03:02:09.185]  And that's really what my job is.
[03:02:09.185 --> 03:02:18.352]  So I want to go to Jay Dyer here and ask him what is about to come up in the next hour and in about 58 minutes.
[03:02:18.352 --> 03:02:23.076]  Owen Schroeder is going to be taking over with the war room.
[03:02:23.076 --> 03:02:25.178]  But people ask, who's going to fight?
[03:02:25.178 --> 03:02:26.038]  Who's going to stand up?
[03:02:26.038 --> 03:02:26.859]  Who's going to resist?
[03:02:26.859 --> 03:02:27.760]  Well, we're here.
[03:02:28.715 --> 03:02:34.339]  And you, watching or listening, this isn't some pat on the head or patronizing thing.
[03:02:34.339 --> 03:02:35.680]  Oh, you're important.
[03:02:35.680 --> 03:02:38.282]  No, you're all important.
[03:02:38.282 --> 03:02:39.223]  You're everything.
[03:02:39.223 --> 03:02:40.624]  You are who are tuned in.
[03:02:40.624 --> 03:02:43.086]  You are the people that actually care.
[03:02:43.086 --> 03:02:45.408]  You're the people that want to be part of the future.
[03:02:45.408 --> 03:02:46.989]  You want to chart your own destiny.
[03:02:46.989 --> 03:02:48.070]  You don't want to be a slave.
[03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:50.740]  And you are what they fear.
[03:02:50.740 --> 03:02:52.841]  When Trump says it all the time, it's totally true.
[03:02:52.841 --> 03:02:55.222]  They're not coming after me, they're coming after you.
[03:02:55.222 --> 03:02:56.722]  They've got to get through me.
[03:02:56.722 --> 03:03:12.227]  So I want to bring Jay Dyer in right now, show that he can give us a little hors d'oeuvre or prelude or little trailer, first look or synopsis of what we're about to hear in the next hour.
[03:03:12.227 --> 03:03:13.707]  Jay Dyer, we're going to break in a minute and a half.
[03:03:13.707 --> 03:03:15.588]  You've got the floor.
[03:03:15.588 --> 03:03:16.348]  Jay's analysis.
[03:03:16.348 --> 03:03:16.768]  Thank you, sir.
[03:03:19.275 --> 03:03:19.635]  Absolutely.
[03:03:19.635 --> 03:03:21.137]  Thank you for bringing me back.
[03:03:21.137 --> 03:03:22.778]  Always love hosting the fourth hour.
[03:03:22.778 --> 03:03:32.646]  Be sure and support InfoWars by going to the InfoWars store and getting those products and keeping the tip of the spear on the air in the midst of all these attacks.
[03:03:32.646 --> 03:03:35.849]  And I thought today what we talk about is a little more of the history of
[03:03:36.787 --> 03:03:48.055]  Dr. John Coleman's book, The Conspirator's Hierarchy, the story of Commedia 300, which Alex has referenced quite a bit in the last few weeks, and we did a podcast on that recently.
[03:03:48.055 --> 03:03:51.838]  And I got to look back at this book, which I haven't looked at many, many years, and I forgot how good it was.
[03:03:51.838 --> 03:04:05.227]  I forgot how much information, how predictive it was, and how it ties into a lot of the other texts that I've been lecturing through and covering lately, such as this excellent history of Gladio by Paul Williams, which I finished.
[03:04:06.039 --> 03:04:09.521]  And you might think, well, what does the Cold War and Gladio have to do with right now?
[03:04:09.521 --> 03:04:10.781]  It seems disconnected.
[03:04:10.781 --> 03:04:25.568]  It doesn't have anything to do with people self-mutilating and people... No, it actually has a lot to do with it, because the entities behind the operations in the Cold War are the same entities that you see involved in the Ukraine operation.
[03:04:26.129 --> 03:04:35.497]  Because NATO and these, you know, groups that supported what amount to the SS, these kinds of things, that was all part of Gladio.
[03:04:35.497 --> 03:04:41.222]  The reason that there are tiny mustache man followers in the Ukraine goes back to Operation Gladio.
[03:04:41.222 --> 03:04:45.966]  And a lot of that also ties into this, the Tavistock Institute.
[03:04:47.111 --> 03:04:54.096]  And so we're going to be talking about Tavistock, which Dr. John Colvin wrote a lot about, which was mind control, psychological warfare, and don't go anywhere.
[03:04:54.096 --> 03:04:55.277]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:55.277 --> 03:04:57.359]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:04:58.757 --> 03:05:06.961]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[03:05:06.961 --> 03:05:08.422]  That is a hellish future.
[03:05:08.422 --> 03:05:17.827]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarshore.com.
[03:05:17.827 --> 03:05:23.430]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:05:23.430 --> 03:05:25.391]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:05:25.991 --> 03:05:31.375]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHore.com.
[03:05:31.375 --> 03:05:35.318]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:05:35.318 --> 03:05:41.203]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:05:41.203 --> 03:05:43.305]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[03:05:44.065 --> 03:05:45.125]  Or unsigned copies.
[03:05:45.125 --> 03:05:55.489]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[03:05:55.489 --> 03:05:56.510]  This is an Infowar.
[03:05:56.510 --> 03:05:57.210]  I'm counting on you.
[03:06:03.570 --> 03:06:04.652]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:04.652 --> 03:06:07.557]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of jaysandalezos.com.
[03:06:07.557 --> 03:06:08.619]  I'm also on YouTube.
[03:06:08.619 --> 03:06:09.660]  I'm also on Rockfin.
[03:06:09.660 --> 03:06:10.502]  I'm also on Twitter.
[03:06:10.502 --> 03:06:11.503]  I'm also on Instagram.
[03:06:11.503 --> 03:06:12.465]  All those different outlets.
[03:06:12.465 --> 03:06:15.350]  Be sure and follow me on all of those.
[03:06:15.350 --> 03:06:16.071]  Rumble as well.
[03:06:17.552 --> 03:06:31.305]  I've been reading all these great Cold War texts and going back and looking at some of those writers that were writing in the 80s and 90s, warning us about what was coming in this New World Order, this technocratic agenda that they had planned.
[03:06:31.305 --> 03:06:39.112]  We've lectured through tons of books, Anthony Sutton, Carol Quigley, all of these academics that have been saying what would come, some pro, some con.
[03:06:39.952 --> 03:06:47.799]  And one of those books that was more of a critique was by the alleged former MI6, MI5, spymaster John Coleman.
[03:06:47.799 --> 03:06:50.362]  And he wrote the book, The Committee of 300.
[03:06:50.362 --> 03:06:56.448]  So a little bit about that book, because it was published, I think, in the early 90s, 1992.
[03:06:56.448 --> 03:07:00.251]  And he said, look, I was in a lot of these meetings.
[03:07:00.251 --> 03:07:05.216]  And in these meetings, we have people who were planning a future technocratic world government.
[03:07:05.856 --> 03:07:25.621]  And he said, you know, I didn't realize that when I was recruited into intelligence work that what was really going on behind the scenes at places like Cambridge and Oxford and Harvard, Yale, the Eastern Seaboard Elite, the Anglo-American establishment, what they were planning was actually a completely different style of living.
[03:07:25.621 --> 03:07:27.982]  That all of life would change.
[03:07:27.982 --> 03:07:34.544]  That we would undergo tumultuous, crazy changes in the coming decades that would lead us out of
[03:07:35.239 --> 03:07:39.081]  What we consider normal, healthy, traditional ways of living.
[03:07:39.081 --> 03:07:45.345]  Having families, going to church, running a business, passing on your inheritance.
[03:07:45.345 --> 03:07:58.213]  Literally everything would be changed because there was a coterie of groups, including entities like the Club of Rome, which planned the future global revolution known as the Green Revolution.
[03:07:58.213 --> 03:08:03.436]  And in their documents that they published back in the 70s all the way up to the 90s,
[03:08:04.784 --> 03:08:15.731]  They argued that we would have an austerity future, a future where it would not be based on production, but on limited resources, resource scarcity.
[03:08:15.731 --> 03:08:18.453]  And I want to get to that agenda because that's what's rolling out right now.
[03:08:18.453 --> 03:08:27.438]  We are right now living in the era of what Dr. John Coleman talked about in regard to these documents of the Club of Rome.
[03:08:27.438 --> 03:08:33.202]  And he says that the people behind the scenes were precisely people like Dr. Henry Kissinger.
[03:08:34.155 --> 03:09:01.669]  At the beginning of Dr. John Coleman's book he talks about an operation that was run by all these same people including Henry Kissinger in Italy and that was known as at that time he said it was just the secret operation where the CIA together with organized crime Sicilian mafia had concocted a plan to fund their black ops through drug money and he says that this was a discovered
[03:09:02.708 --> 03:09:10.045]  By many secret society members being leaked throughout the 70s and 80s in Italy and throughout Europe.
[03:09:10.669 --> 03:09:13.751]  We now know today that this was Operation Gladio.
[03:09:13.751 --> 03:09:19.836]  Because Gladio wasn't known until about 1990 in terms of what it really was and what it was about.
[03:09:19.836 --> 03:09:23.439]  Now, the auspices of Gladio seem plausible, they seem sensible.
[03:09:23.439 --> 03:09:34.167]  Hey, why don't we have a secret army, a bunch of cells, a few thousand people trained throughout Europe and other countries to stave off a future potential Soviet invasion.
[03:09:34.167 --> 03:09:39.771]  So maybe Stalin, maybe Khrushchev, maybe later Soviet leaders are going to try to invade
[03:09:40.700 --> 03:09:44.888]  and establish a Soviet government, we better have a stay-behind unit.
[03:09:44.888 --> 03:09:53.384]  And the means and methods that they use were the recruitment of certain organized crime figures in certain Masonic societies, namely the P2 Lodge in Italy.
[03:09:55.091 --> 03:10:01.457]  The P2 in Italy and the CIA used the Vatican Bank as their chief operation for money laundering.
[03:10:01.457 --> 03:10:02.778]  They had other banks as well.
[03:10:02.778 --> 03:10:05.961]  They set up numerous shell companies, numerous shell banks.
[03:10:05.961 --> 03:10:07.683]  And again, that's a big part of Gladio.
[03:10:07.683 --> 03:10:11.987]  Of course, Paul Williams covers it in his book, Operation Gladio.
[03:10:11.987 --> 03:10:13.989]  Now, why are we talking about, again, all this Cold War stuff?
[03:10:13.989 --> 03:10:19.214]  Because you can't understand where we are now without understanding the real architecture and breakdown of the Cold War.
[03:10:20.405 --> 03:10:36.248]  And while it's true that there's a potential or some kind of danger that might have come about through the popularity of communism, we know in Italy at this time that the Christian Democratic Party was beginning to lose adherence and communism was on the rise.
[03:10:36.248 --> 03:10:41.569]  And not only does Paul Williams talk about that, Dr. John Coleman talks about that in the late 70s, early 80s.
[03:10:41.569 --> 03:10:46.790]  And so we had these operations that Kissinger and other entities basically ran.
[03:10:48.032 --> 03:10:53.636]  In Italy, where they staged the kidnapping of Aldo Moro.
[03:10:53.636 --> 03:10:56.318]  They did all these operations to make communism look bad.
[03:10:56.318 --> 03:10:57.258]  Now, communism was bad.
[03:10:57.258 --> 03:10:58.859]  I'm not saying it was good.
[03:10:58.859 --> 03:11:05.403]  But we have these entities that are basically big crime syndicates, right?
[03:11:05.403 --> 03:11:08.125]  It's two different organized crime syndicates, you could say.
[03:11:08.125 --> 03:11:13.729]  You could say the communist crime syndicate versus the Gladio crime syndicate, NATO crime syndicate.
[03:11:13.729 --> 03:11:16.791]  And one thing that we know is that the people behind Gladio, the people behind
[03:11:17.785 --> 03:11:26.692]  The so-called right wing were also all of these Club of Rome people pushing for a future Great Reset, a future austerity.
[03:11:26.692 --> 03:11:37.981]  For example, John Coleman says, the Club of Rome conspired through umbrella organizations and they achieved a marriage between the Anglo-American establishment and the old black nobility families of Europe.
[03:11:37.981 --> 03:11:41.884]  So this would be like, you know, the King of England and all these groups, right?
[03:11:41.884 --> 03:11:44.846]  The so-called nobility in London, Venice, Genoa.
[03:11:44.846 --> 03:11:47.448]  The key to their successful control was to create and manage
[03:11:51.114 --> 03:12:07.343]  And he says that the Committee of 300, which he's just calling that, if you know about David Rothkopf, he wrote a book about the rulers of the world.
[03:12:07.343 --> 03:12:09.164]  He's from the Kissinger Group.
[03:12:09.164 --> 03:12:10.925]  He wrote another book about running the world.
[03:12:10.925 --> 03:12:15.668]  And it's basically, he talks about a 6,000 people managerial class that runs the planet.
[03:12:16.417 --> 03:12:20.841]  That's a mainline academic, again, coming from under the Kissinger group.
[03:12:20.841 --> 03:12:28.667]  Then above that, Dr. John Coleman posits there's another 300 people that kind of tell these people what to do.
[03:12:28.667 --> 03:12:30.769]  And amongst that group, you could figure out who it is.
[03:12:30.769 --> 03:12:36.114]  It would be people like, you know, Prince Charles, the Queen of England, Lord Rothschild.
[03:12:36.114 --> 03:12:41.118]  It would be, you know, people like Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[03:12:41.118 --> 03:12:44.681]  So that's that coterie of the top controllers.
[03:12:45.552 --> 03:12:54.422]  And these are the people that all have similar positions in groups like the CFR, Trilateral Commission, Club of Rome, Rand Corporation, Sanford Research.
[03:12:54.422 --> 03:12:57.225]  They sort of go in and out of all of these entities.
[03:12:57.225 --> 03:12:59.848]  And that's publicly on record.
[03:12:59.848 --> 03:13:04.674]  That's why the members of Bilderberg are the same people in Trilateral, the same people in CFR.
[03:13:04.674 --> 03:13:05.515]  That's who runs the planet.
[03:13:07.495 --> 03:13:10.636]  So we're talking about the top CEOs of the Fortune 100.
[03:13:10.636 --> 03:13:14.556]  We're talking about the top think tank planners and social engineers.
[03:13:14.556 --> 03:13:16.457]  We're talking about the Kissingers, the Brzezinski's.
[03:13:16.457 --> 03:13:20.277]  We're talking about the Jacques Attali's, the David Rockefeller's.
[03:13:20.277 --> 03:13:24.318]  These are the top people, top men, right?
[03:13:24.318 --> 03:13:27.819]  Healing our planet.
[03:13:27.819 --> 03:13:33.760]  And we know that they have the same plan because they all openly say they have the same plan.
[03:13:33.760 --> 03:13:35.540]  This is not a theory.
[03:13:35.540 --> 03:13:36.180]  This is a fact.
[03:13:37.111 --> 03:13:42.133]  A theory is something that you theorize about that you have perhaps some evidence for.
[03:13:42.133 --> 03:13:44.374]  Maybe a little bit of evidence, maybe a lot.
[03:13:44.374 --> 03:13:49.456]  That is not a fact, because a fact is something that is objectively the case.
[03:13:49.456 --> 03:13:54.378]  And all the people that are involved in this have written countless books, which we've lectured through.
[03:13:54.378 --> 03:13:56.379]  Sixty, seventy of them now.
[03:13:56.379 --> 03:13:56.939]  Many of them.
[03:13:56.939 --> 03:14:03.721]  White papers, think tank documents, actual big geopolitical texts.
[03:14:03.721 --> 03:14:04.902]  We've lectured through many of these.
[03:14:05.603 --> 03:14:11.824]  And there's absolutely no doubt that there is this overall overarching plan.
[03:14:11.824 --> 03:14:15.805]  And we've talked about all the different groups because they're also all public.
[03:14:15.805 --> 03:14:27.548]  And one reason we know this, the same guy running the Gladio operations, for example, basically at the tip top, I'm talking about the Kissinger people up at the top of that, State Department Memorandum 200.
[03:14:27.548 --> 03:14:31.689]  We need to bring in austerity to bring down the population of the third world.
[03:14:33.874 --> 03:14:37.276]  And under the Nixon administration, that's not the only instance.
[03:14:37.276 --> 03:14:54.866]  In fact, under the Nixon administration, Kissinger was promoting and pushing all of these papers and memorandums for population reduction because he works for the Rockefeller Foundation, just like everybody else that pushes population control works for these same entities publicly.
[03:14:54.866 --> 03:15:01.029]  State Department Memorandum 200, reducing global population.
[03:15:01.029 --> 03:15:02.590]  Now, that doesn't mean they're going to get it done that year.
[03:15:03.655 --> 03:15:05.436]  These are long-term plans.
[03:15:05.436 --> 03:15:08.659]  Long-term actuary plans.
[03:15:08.659 --> 03:15:09.359]  Right?
[03:15:09.359 --> 03:15:12.061]  About how to achieve these events.
[03:15:12.061 --> 03:15:19.166]  And he says that a lot of these people consider themselves to be the wise men of the West or the Olympians.
[03:15:19.166 --> 03:15:21.088]  In other words, comparing themselves to
[03:15:21.792 --> 03:15:23.653]  We're talking about the Gods of Olympus, right?
[03:15:23.653 --> 03:15:24.654]  We're talking about the Kissingers.
[03:15:24.654 --> 03:15:29.017]  We're talking about the George McGundy, McGeorge Bundy's.
[03:15:29.017 --> 03:15:30.598]  We're talking about the George Keenan's.
[03:15:30.598 --> 03:15:31.739]  We're talking about the Henry Kissinger's.
[03:15:31.739 --> 03:15:32.940]  We're talking about the Brzezinski's.
[03:15:32.940 --> 03:15:34.841]  We're talking about John McCloy.
[03:15:34.841 --> 03:15:40.945]  We're talking about all of these high-level CFR planners and strategists.
[03:15:40.945 --> 03:15:41.785]  Cyrus Vance.
[03:15:41.785 --> 03:15:45.268]  We're talking about all these kind of people, right?
[03:15:45.268 --> 03:15:49.671]  With a single plan to bring in a single technocratic world government.
[03:15:50.909 --> 03:15:52.130]  Don't go anywhere when we come back.
[03:15:52.130 --> 03:15:56.833]  We're gonna figure out how all those plans manifest and what is going on in the real world.
[03:15:56.833 --> 03:16:09.482]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[03:16:09.482 --> 03:16:11.264]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[03:16:11.264 --> 03:16:13.025]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[03:16:13.419 --> 03:16:16.221]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[03:16:16.221 --> 03:16:17.942]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[03:16:17.942 --> 03:16:20.464]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[03:16:20.464 --> 03:16:24.807]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[03:16:24.807 --> 03:16:30.531]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[03:16:30.531 --> 03:16:35.535]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[03:16:35.535 --> 03:16:38.657]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the
[03:16:38.877 --> 03:16:40.719]  I intend to take the InfoWars
[03:17:02.347 --> 03:17:05.869]  Armored truck out or the Info Wars tank as it's so lovingly called.
[03:17:05.869 --> 03:17:10.312]  You came through yesterday and shopped at InfoWarsStore.com so I'm gonna be able to take the truck out.
[03:17:58.619 --> 03:18:08.322]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life and InfoWars for decades has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.

[03:18:47.654 --> 03:18:50.104]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[03:18:50.104 --> 03:18:50.988]  We didn't have them for sale.
[03:18:50.988 --> 03:18:52.554]  But now, I signed the last books.

[03:19:04.535 --> 03:19:09.859]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.

[03:19:40.981 --> 03:19:44.043]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:20:12.901 --> 03:20:14.102]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.102 --> 03:20:19.486]  I'm just rifling through all of these old foreign affairs magazine or journal texts.
[03:20:19.486 --> 03:20:29.134]  And here's an old one from 1972, which features a really interesting article by old Zbig himself.
[03:20:29.134 --> 03:20:32.196]  How the Cold War was played by Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[03:20:32.196 --> 03:20:37.580]  And this was in 1972 when he was laying out the strategies up till that time.
[03:20:37.580 --> 03:20:39.662]  And the amazing part is that, you know,
[03:20:40.729 --> 03:20:53.351]  Zbigniew Brzezinski then took over Cold War machinations and operations and recruited the Mujahideen, what would later become Al Qaeda, to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan.
[03:20:53.351 --> 03:21:00.993]  And we know that the focal point of Afghanistan is not just a geostrategic area, but it's also a drug poppy region.
[03:21:00.993 --> 03:21:07.574]  And after the U.S., post 9-11 invasion of Afghanistan, we have the explosion of heroin production.
[03:21:08.260 --> 03:21:12.363]  From 200, 300 tons a year to something like 5,000.
[03:21:12.363 --> 03:21:15.745]  Remember Geraldo interviewing troops.
[03:21:15.745 --> 03:21:17.126]  Those clips are still on YouTube.
[03:21:17.126 --> 03:21:19.688]  You can find them from Fox News.
[03:21:19.688 --> 03:21:19.928]  U.S.
[03:21:19.928 --> 03:21:21.629]  troops guarding the opium.
[03:21:21.629 --> 03:21:27.373]  And you listen to the troops and they say, well, we're going to burn all this opium, this billion-dollar crop.
[03:21:27.373 --> 03:21:29.715]  We're going to plant cucumbers.
[03:21:29.715 --> 03:21:31.296]  Give me a break.
[03:21:31.296 --> 03:21:31.936]  Cucumbers.
[03:21:31.936 --> 03:21:33.257]  Who believes that?
[03:21:33.257 --> 03:21:35.499]  What is the plan of these Olympians, these
[03:21:36.167 --> 03:21:39.989]  These titans, these technocrats, what do they want to set up?
[03:21:39.989 --> 03:21:45.231]  Well, Dr. Coleman says, here's a helpful list of the things that you will see.
[03:21:45.231 --> 03:21:46.191]  Again, this is written in 1992.
[03:21:46.191 --> 03:21:56.375]  He says, based on the plans of these elite, he says that they will eventually, number one, create a one world government, where there will be a unified church and a unified monetary system.
[03:21:56.375 --> 03:22:01.737]  So, Dr. Coleman is one of the few people who understands the importance of this one world religion that they're pushing and promoting.
[03:22:01.737 --> 03:22:03.978]  Something that we've talked about for many years, and in fact,
[03:22:05.577 --> 03:22:23.110]  Pope Francis has just inaugurated his multi-faith center in Abu Dhabi, where the three world great monotheistic religions, as he says, Judaism, Islam, Christianity, will now merge into some kind of new hybrid thing.
[03:22:23.110 --> 03:22:31.316]  A new hybrid world religion, where all the world religions are basically tools of the super state, the world technocratic order.
[03:22:32.839 --> 03:22:37.384]  Number two, the utter destruction of all national identity and national movements and pride.
[03:22:37.384 --> 03:22:41.929]  That, of course, is a huge move that's been pushed for the last several decades.
[03:22:41.929 --> 03:22:49.618]  The anti-American movement, the idea that any form of patriotism is itself evil, racist, right?
[03:22:49.618 --> 03:22:50.659]  The destruction of religion.
[03:23:17.833 --> 03:23:31.997]  We're going through the list of Dr. John Coleman and after there being a new world religion with no dogmas, we're told that Rosensky says, quote, we will enter into a new age of technotronics, the technotronic technocratic era.
[03:23:31.997 --> 03:23:34.078]  And he says that this will basically create
[03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:39.191]  Androids, cyborgs, and a version of humans that we've never seen before.
[03:23:39.191 --> 03:23:40.972]  In other words, transhumanism.
[03:23:40.972 --> 03:23:44.853]  Again, from Brzezinski's famous book, Between Two Ages.
[03:23:44.853 --> 03:23:54.656]  There will be an end to all industrialization and the production of nuclear energy into what they call a zero population, zero growth society.
[03:23:54.656 --> 03:23:56.336]  So this is that austerity I'm talking about.
[03:23:56.336 --> 03:23:59.797]  This is that agenda for total energy control to put everybody in
[03:24:00.564 --> 03:24:06.449]  A communal living, everybody in a coffin apartment, everybody in a coom pod.
[03:24:06.449 --> 03:24:11.753]  And that's part of a larger agenda that we'll talk about here in a minute, which is the complete shutting down of everything.
[03:24:11.753 --> 03:24:14.535]  That's the eventual goal.
[03:24:14.535 --> 03:24:20.059]  So, this deindustrialization will send all the production off to other countries.
[03:24:20.059 --> 03:24:23.341]  And of course, remember NAFTA, remember GATT, remember TPP, all that stuff.
[03:24:23.341 --> 03:24:24.322]  That was part of this.
[03:24:24.322 --> 03:24:25.403]  That was pushing all of this.
[03:24:26.109 --> 03:24:30.372]  We will see the complete legalization of all drugs and all forms of pornography.
[03:24:30.372 --> 03:24:31.233]  That's already begun.
[03:24:31.233 --> 03:24:40.200]  We will see the movement of people out of wild areas and into large cities, ultimately for the goal of population control.
[03:24:40.200 --> 03:24:42.121]  So he's actually talking about the 15 minute cities.
[03:24:42.121 --> 03:24:46.085]  He's talking about the, you know, basically running.
[03:24:46.085 --> 03:24:47.305]  It's living in an A.I.
[03:24:47.305 --> 03:24:51.729]  technocratic grid that you are controlled and tracked in these smart cities.
[03:24:52.756 --> 03:24:59.439]  There will be a suppression of all scientific development, except for scientific developments deemed beneficial by the Committee of 300.
[03:24:59.439 --> 03:25:14.785]  Now, this we see in the book Brave New World, which I just lectured through that entire book, chapter by chapter, for my members, if you want to go listen to the full breakdown, because this is... I hadn't gone through Brave New World in probably six years.
[03:25:14.785 --> 03:25:17.146]  Going through it again, I was amazed at how much I missed.
[03:25:17.146 --> 03:25:21.828]  There's so much stuff in there that Huxley, an insider to all of this, he put in the book and said,
[03:25:22.475 --> 03:25:24.317]  This is a real story.
[03:25:24.317 --> 03:25:26.599]  This is not fiction, this is real.
[03:25:26.599 --> 03:25:33.164]  This is what they're going to roll out, and that's exactly what we see rolling out.
[03:25:33.164 --> 03:25:41.071]  And in regard to the suppression of real science, the suppression of actual, you know, health developments and all this kind of stuff, that's actually in Brave New World as well.
[03:25:41.071 --> 03:25:43.233]  The World Socialist Controller, Massaf Aman, says,
[03:25:44.053 --> 03:25:46.536]  That we can't give everybody, you know, the truth.
[03:25:46.536 --> 03:25:49.218]  Everybody can't handle these real scientific developments.
[03:25:49.218 --> 03:25:52.502]  We have to suppress this, and we have to dumb down the population.
[03:25:52.502 --> 03:25:53.443]  Right?
[03:25:53.443 --> 03:25:54.964]  It's, again, real world.
[03:25:54.964 --> 03:25:55.545]  It's not fiction.
[03:25:56.926 --> 03:26:12.637]  There will be strategic operations of an arc of crisis and strategy of tension, he says, throughout various countries, eventually leading to so much chaos that we can have means by which there will be an eventual depopulation by the year 2050.
[03:26:12.637 --> 03:26:17.140]  So they'll reduce the world population to 500 million and then down to 100 million by 2050.
[03:26:18.340 --> 03:26:25.304]  And that will be achieved through continual war, continual bio-releases, continual everything you can think of.
[03:26:25.304 --> 03:26:27.766]  This is the Global 2000 Report.
[03:26:27.766 --> 03:26:34.750]  And this was, you can look to high-level people like Cyrus Vance, who were involved in the production of these kinds of documents.
[03:26:34.750 --> 03:26:40.053]  We should probably cover this Global 2000 Report, since we haven't done that one yet.
[03:26:40.911 --> 03:26:47.995]  The moral fiber of the nation must be demoralized and must be destroyed through toxic culture.
[03:26:47.995 --> 03:26:49.776]  Now this is where Tavistock comes into play.
[03:26:49.776 --> 03:27:06.444]  You heard me talk about Tavistock and I've mentioned and analyzed the Daniel Esselstyn book on Tavistock so many times because it goes into the actual strategies of the various doctors, the various, even people from the Frankfurt School, Marcuse,
[03:27:07.354 --> 03:27:13.715]  You know, these weirdo figures that were really degenerate philosophers who engineered where we are now.
[03:27:13.715 --> 03:27:16.416]  We're talking about the 1960s counterculture, right?
[03:27:16.416 --> 03:27:19.896]  That's Esalen Institute, that's Tavistock Institute.
[03:27:19.896 --> 03:27:25.657]  It's engineering these ideas that Alvin Toffler, another one of the global elite, writes about.
[03:27:25.657 --> 03:27:32.659]  He wrote about in the 1970s and 80s, not just in Powership, but also in books like Future Shock.
[03:27:32.659 --> 03:27:33.519]  Future Shock is a
[03:27:34.352 --> 03:27:35.392]  Tavistock idea.
[03:27:35.392 --> 03:27:47.915]  It's a Tavistock terminology whereby they talk about shocking the population with such crazy, overblown information, so much, so much change that you can't process it.
[03:27:47.915 --> 03:27:54.457]  And this creates a apathetic, malleable, pliable population.
[03:27:54.457 --> 03:27:58.638]  That's the purpose of the psychological warfare that Tavistock puts out.
[03:27:58.638 --> 03:28:00.358]  That's what this book is about.
[03:28:00.358 --> 03:28:03.159]  What is Tavistock published and what have they been involved in?
[03:28:03.908 --> 03:28:11.394]  Psychological operations, the promotion of scientism, the promotion of feminism, the Phoenix Program.
[03:28:11.394 --> 03:28:13.296]  They were all involved in all of these things.
[03:28:13.296 --> 03:28:19.021]  MKUltra, studying shell shock dissociation, studying and promoting groupthink.
[03:28:19.021 --> 03:28:24.025]  Groupthink is a Tavistock operation.
[03:28:24.025 --> 03:28:28.328]  They also were involved in pushing and creating, promoting the vegan movement.
[03:28:28.328 --> 03:28:30.990]  Veganism is a Tavistock thing.
[03:28:30.990 --> 03:28:32.712]  Coming out of Stanford Research.
[03:28:33.562 --> 03:28:37.665]  Again, all covered in this book.
[03:28:37.665 --> 03:28:46.772]  But that's what Dr. John Coleman is talking about, is that these manuals, these books, Changing Images of Man, by Harmon, right?
[03:28:46.772 --> 03:28:50.875]  The Aquarian Conspiracy, Marilyn Ferguson.
[03:28:50.875 --> 03:28:51.836]  Coleman talks about these.
[03:28:51.836 --> 03:28:54.798]  Don't go anywhere, we'll get more into the Aquarian Conspiracy when we come back.
[03:28:57.970 --> 03:29:01.093]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:29:01.093 --> 03:29:03.415]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:29:03.415 --> 03:29:07.338]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:29:07.338 --> 03:29:15.425]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:29:15.425 --> 03:29:24.072]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroeder and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:29:25.077 --> 03:29:28.701]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:29:28.701 --> 03:29:34.507]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:29:34.507 --> 03:29:37.551]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:29:37.551 --> 03:29:45.800]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keep us on air.
[03:29:46.440 --> 03:29:48.142]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[03:29:48.142 --> 03:29:51.606]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[03:29:51.606 --> 03:29:55.169]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[03:30:09.764 --> 03:30:20.488]  That's why I asked listeners respectively to go to InfoWarStore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[03:30:20.488 --> 03:30:22.489]  InfoWarStore.com.
[03:30:22.489 --> 03:30:35.755]  To get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World, Ultimate Bone Broth, Back and Stock, Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[03:30:36.355 --> 03:30:38.577]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:30:38.577 --> 03:30:40.419]  Some of the very best products.
[03:30:40.419 --> 03:30:42.541]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWarsTore.
[03:30:42.541 --> 03:30:47.866]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWarsTore.
[03:30:47.866 --> 03:30:50.728]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[03:30:50.728 --> 03:30:52.090]  Plus, they keep us on air.
[03:30:52.090 --> 03:30:53.611]  So again, please take action.
[03:30:53.611 --> 03:30:57.555]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com today, and I thank you.
[03:30:57.555 --> 03:30:58.035]  Right now,
[03:30:59.116 --> 03:31:09.527]  I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to info or store.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body and keep us on air.
[03:31:09.527 --> 03:31:13.771]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in
[03:31:14.432 --> 03:31:17.856]  Many of you for years have never gone to InfoWarshaw.com.
[03:31:17.856 --> 03:31:26.665]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarshaw.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[03:31:26.665 --> 03:31:29.728]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[03:31:29.728 --> 03:31:30.669]  That's great and I thank you.
[03:31:31.089 --> 03:31:32.610]  But we need funds to operate.
[03:31:32.610 --> 03:31:40.975]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil, and our fizzy magnesium, and our sleep aid, and our nitric oxide, and our real red pill.
[03:31:40.975 --> 03:31:43.937]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[03:31:43.937 --> 03:31:45.698]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[03:31:45.698 --> 03:31:47.018]  So get off the bench.
[03:31:47.018 --> 03:31:47.859]  Get in the game.
[03:31:47.859 --> 03:31:48.859]  Step to the plate.
[03:31:48.859 --> 03:31:54.603]  And go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:56.960 --> 03:32:03.630]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:32:03.630 --> 03:32:05.553]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:32:05.553 --> 03:32:07.075]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[03:32:07.075 --> 03:32:09.859]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[03:32:09.859 --> 03:32:11.882]  And it says political prisoner.
[03:32:12.643 --> 03:32:14.625]  With an image of President Trump.
[03:32:14.625 --> 03:32:17.067]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:32:17.067 --> 03:32:19.209]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:32:19.209 --> 03:32:24.574]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[03:32:24.574 --> 03:32:25.795]  Jail background.
[03:32:25.795 --> 03:32:26.836]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:32:26.836 --> 03:32:30.980]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:32:30.980 --> 03:32:32.581]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[03:32:32.581 --> 03:32:33.602]  No, I'm not running for President.
[03:32:33.602 --> 03:32:36.144]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[03:32:36.144 --> 03:32:36.925]  Red, white, and blue.
[03:32:36.925 --> 03:32:37.806]  Alex Jones for President.
[03:32:38.706 --> 03:32:41.348]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[03:32:41.348 --> 03:32:43.209]  Great way to fund the operation.
[03:32:43.209 --> 03:32:58.560]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at infowarestore.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:32:58.560 --> 03:33:04.444]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:14.594 --> 03:33:15.655]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.655 --> 03:33:23.599]  I want to remind you that if you want to see me live, you can do so by going to my website there, and you'll notice there's a post at the top about two new live events that we have coming up.
[03:33:23.599 --> 03:33:26.240]  You can get tickets there, including June 3rd and 4th.
[03:33:26.240 --> 03:33:34.904]  Owen Schroeder will be present at that event, so that's going to be a lot of fun, as well as a host of other excellent researchers, artists, musicians, and comedians.
[03:33:34.904 --> 03:33:43.589]  And we're going through this discussion of the Tauzog Institute preparing what's called the Aquarian Conspiracy, and this was
[03:33:44.509 --> 03:33:46.150]  A book that was written in the 1980s.
[03:33:46.150 --> 03:33:49.031]  I think this was 1980.
[03:33:49.031 --> 03:33:50.092]  We have the documents, folks.
[03:33:50.092 --> 03:33:51.392]  We have the documents.
[03:33:51.392 --> 03:33:56.054]  Eighty-two, three, somewhere in there.
[03:33:56.054 --> 03:33:56.235]  Eighty.
[03:33:56.235 --> 03:33:57.115]  1980 by Marilyn Ferguson.
[03:33:57.837 --> 03:34:02.719]  And although this book is titled The Aquarian Conspiracy, it's not actually a conspiracy text.
[03:34:02.719 --> 03:34:14.885]  In fact, she is a proponent of this completely new revamping and new way of doing all of life, where she says that everything's got to change.
[03:34:14.885 --> 03:34:17.927]  For example, women have got to be put into leadership roles.
[03:34:17.927 --> 03:34:20.028]  Men have got to become more feminine.
[03:34:20.028 --> 03:34:22.449]  We've got to have more New Age stuff.
[03:34:22.449 --> 03:34:23.850]  We've got to change the churches.
[03:34:23.850 --> 03:34:25.210]  Values have to be inverted.
[03:34:25.210 --> 03:34:25.991]  Everything flips.
[03:34:27.236 --> 03:34:32.038]  Or what she calls value transformation.
[03:34:32.038 --> 03:34:37.861]  Instead of thinking of yourself as an individual who, you know, has a job and starts a business or whatever.
[03:34:37.861 --> 03:34:41.963]  No, you're part of a collective and you're going to be living in a communal style of life.
[03:34:41.963 --> 03:34:47.546]  You're going to be part and parcel of a whole earth global transformation.
[03:34:47.546 --> 03:34:48.647]  The whole earth conspiracy.
[03:34:48.647 --> 03:34:52.628]  Now, again, this is not a conspiracy book.
[03:34:52.628 --> 03:34:53.309]  This is her.
[03:34:54.201 --> 03:34:58.062]  Promotion, and she's saying what we're doing is a conspiracy.
[03:34:58.062 --> 03:35:01.403]  But it's an open conspiracy in the words of HG Wells.
[03:35:01.403 --> 03:35:03.244]  It's the same plan.
[03:35:03.244 --> 03:35:16.708]  So that plan comes out of Tavistock, and Tavistock planned all of the promotion of the trans and skittles stuff that you see today.
[03:35:16.708 --> 03:35:20.129]  Literally, look up the news the last five or six years.
[03:35:20.129 --> 03:35:22.710]  Spearheading this movement is the Tavistock Institute.
[03:35:23.559 --> 03:35:24.259]  Why?
[03:35:24.259 --> 03:35:26.881]  Why do they care so much about that?
[03:35:26.881 --> 03:35:33.344]  Because it promotes sterilization and the inability to have offspring.
[03:35:33.344 --> 03:35:35.966]  And it destroys families.
[03:35:35.966 --> 03:35:38.907]  Reducing families reduces population.
[03:35:38.907 --> 03:35:40.668]  That's all this is about.
[03:35:40.668 --> 03:35:41.989]  Everything is that.
[03:35:41.989 --> 03:35:44.491]  That's it.
[03:35:44.491 --> 03:35:47.632]  It's not hard to figure out what's going on.
[03:35:47.632 --> 03:35:48.913]  It's in all of these books.
[03:35:50.768 --> 03:35:53.731]  But I was seeing some statistics the other day.
[03:35:53.731 --> 03:35:54.411]  I was blown away.
[03:35:54.411 --> 03:35:55.112]  I couldn't believe it.
[03:35:55.112 --> 03:35:55.772]  But now I can.
[03:35:55.772 --> 03:36:01.958]  I think something like 60% of students, like high school students, they can't even read.
[03:36:01.958 --> 03:36:03.319]  And they've never read a book.
[03:36:03.319 --> 03:36:08.384]  So we're at like totally, you know, Eloy Morlock situation almost from H.G.
[03:36:08.384 --> 03:36:13.168]  Wells, where it's like we're dealing with people who have never read a book and probably can't even read.
[03:36:13.168 --> 03:36:14.109]  I'm not trying to be mean.
[03:36:14.109 --> 03:36:17.512]  I'm saying literally that's what the statistics show.
[03:36:17.512 --> 03:36:17.752]  So
[03:36:19.685 --> 03:36:28.013]  I mean, even though this is in a hundred different books that I can look at right now on my shelf, people are never going to figure this out, and they don't care, and they don't want to.
[03:36:28.013 --> 03:36:31.076]  And that's part of the point of the apology, right?
[03:36:31.076 --> 03:36:38.122]  When the philosopher tries to enlighten the people, they get mad, they want to stone him.
[03:36:38.122 --> 03:36:40.524]  Stop taking away our shadows on the wall.
[03:36:40.524 --> 03:36:41.265]  We don't want to know that.
[03:36:43.829 --> 03:37:00.977]  Dr. Coleman says that Tavistock was instrumental in engineering not just the sexual revolution, but the 60s countercultural revolution because sex, drugs, and rock and roll were discovered to be amazingly effective means of social change.
[03:37:00.977 --> 03:37:12.222]  Not for the positive, but to degenerate and destroy and toxify culture to make people more malleable for the technocratic global collective.
[03:37:13.174 --> 03:37:16.496]  That doesn't mean that everybody who's a 60s counterculture musician was a bad guy.
[03:37:16.496 --> 03:37:17.497]  No, no, no.
[03:37:17.497 --> 03:37:23.101]  There were a lot of people who had good ideas and were authentic, organic musicians.
[03:37:23.101 --> 03:37:28.104]  But that got taken over and steered into the degenerate, controlled pop culture that you see today.
[03:37:28.104 --> 03:37:29.946]  Everybody making the all-seeing eye image.
[03:37:29.946 --> 03:37:32.167]  You're like, why are they all doing that?
[03:37:32.167 --> 03:37:34.769]  Because they're all part of the same club.
[03:37:36.121 --> 03:37:38.283]  Or they want to be members of this club.
[03:37:38.283 --> 03:37:42.986]  These are all the just pop stars thinking that they're being social climbers or whatever.
[03:37:42.986 --> 03:37:48.850]  When in reality, what's the first rule of all the revolutionary takeovers?
[03:37:48.850 --> 03:37:51.272]  It's amazing that people don't know this.
[03:37:51.272 --> 03:37:53.533]  Or that people that do know it.
[03:37:53.533 --> 03:38:04.401]  And if you heard my lecture that I did on the famous NKVD interrogation of Khrushchev Murkowski, the Bulgarian socialist Trotskyite, when he was interrogated by
[03:38:06.863 --> 03:38:12.127]  So Collins in KBD, they told him, you're going to die or you're going to tell us what's really going on.
[03:38:12.127 --> 03:38:15.010]  And he said, all right, I'll tell you what's going on because I know you're probably going to kill me anyway.
[03:38:15.010 --> 03:38:18.913]  And he said that basically this is all a scam.
[03:38:18.913 --> 03:38:25.118]  The capitalist, communist, monopoly capitalist, communist dialectic is run by the same people.
[03:38:25.118 --> 03:38:32.784]  And the ultimate goal is to allow monopoly capitalism to build the infrastructure, which will then be taken over by the revolutionaries.
[03:38:32.784 --> 03:38:35.867]  The true Trotskyite, true
[03:38:36.624 --> 03:38:38.725]  Luciferian revolutionaries.
[03:38:38.725 --> 03:38:43.287]  And they will get rid of their revolutionary guard.
[03:38:43.287 --> 03:38:47.509]  They will get rid of their dupes.
[03:38:47.509 --> 03:38:50.831]  Amazing.
[03:38:50.831 --> 03:38:52.692]  And then Stalin did the same thing.
[03:38:52.692 --> 03:38:55.533]  Stalin purged all of his immediate underlings.
[03:38:55.533 --> 03:38:56.213]  Why?
[03:38:56.213 --> 03:38:59.515]  Because you can't allow the people that participate in
[03:39:00.663 --> 03:39:06.326]  The selling out and destruction of the culture to go into the new power structure.
[03:39:06.326 --> 03:39:08.207]  Because they just sold everybody out.
[03:39:08.207 --> 03:39:10.548]  So they're not reliable.
[03:39:10.548 --> 03:39:17.411]  So the more devious and cunning technocratically know that their underlings are the first people that go.
[03:39:18.584 --> 03:39:22.628]  And if you're familiar with the history of the French Revolution, you know that that's exactly what happened.
[03:39:22.628 --> 03:39:28.173]  French revolutionaries, they would all just purge the ones right underneath them when they came to power.
[03:39:28.173 --> 03:39:33.538]  Because they knew how devious and wicked the underlings were.
[03:39:33.538 --> 03:39:35.079]  John Coleman is basically saying that.
[03:39:36.280 --> 03:39:41.124]  This will lead to eventually the introduction of this technocratic order.
[03:39:41.124 --> 03:39:42.705]  Now, there's a lot of madmen out there.
[03:39:42.705 --> 03:39:48.991]  There's a lot of people in insane, you know, in the government and the Biden and, you know, these level people.
[03:39:48.991 --> 03:39:51.032]  But these level people, they're not really running things.
[03:39:51.032 --> 03:39:56.797]  And I think I would think that the whole Biden thing shows us that Biden isn't really running things.
[03:39:56.797 --> 03:39:57.638]  It's people like this.
[03:39:58.484 --> 03:39:59.805]  The Kissingers, the Brzezinskis, right?
[03:39:59.805 --> 03:40:14.051]  Now, Brzezinski's gone, Kissinger's very advanced in age, but the people at that level, that holdover sort of boomer power structure that's still holding the reins of power, they are still calling the shots.
[03:40:14.051 --> 03:40:17.193]  They still have the majority of the world's wealth, right?
[03:40:17.193 --> 03:40:21.355]  Blackrock, Vanguard-type people.
[03:40:21.355 --> 03:40:27.818]  And he says that as we move through the plan of this high-level group, trilaterals and the CFR and all that,
[03:40:28.556 --> 03:40:31.599]  They have decided to manage all of these crises.
[03:40:31.599 --> 03:40:36.243]  This is where the model of Gladio, so we're not under Gladio, it's just the model of Gladio.
[03:40:36.243 --> 03:40:47.954]  What they did in the Cold War with Gladio, and by the way I'm not just going from so-called quote conspiracy texts, this is actually just a PhD thesis, Daniel Ganser's book, Gladio, Secret Armies.
[03:40:49.235 --> 03:40:53.616]  So it's not like we're under the threat of some giant global right-wing Gladio thing.
[03:40:53.616 --> 03:40:54.696]  That's not what I'm saying.
[03:40:54.696 --> 03:41:06.379]  I'm saying that the structures and techniques that Gladio perfected are the structures and techniques for how it's run today.
[03:41:06.379 --> 03:41:14.560]  So the Gladio secret armies are the same pattern and model for the radical ISIS Al Qaeda models.
[03:41:14.560 --> 03:41:15.681]  You see, that's what I'm saying.
[03:41:15.681 --> 03:41:17.181]  The strategy of tension
[03:41:17.918 --> 03:41:24.441]  That was previously Gladio is now that kind of stuff.
[03:41:24.441 --> 03:41:29.182]  Now, we haven't heard a whole lot of ISIS Al Qaeda in the news lately.
[03:41:29.182 --> 03:41:32.384]  But of course, any of that can come back at any moment.
[03:41:32.384 --> 03:41:42.948]  Because those are all hybrid warfare, proxy warfare strategies and techniques that can be used by the establishment when they need to roll them out.
[03:41:42.948 --> 03:41:43.488]  Likewise,
[03:41:45.643 --> 03:41:51.725]  We can see the strategy of tension, as I said, involved in the groups that are run in the Ukraine.
[03:41:51.725 --> 03:42:08.451]  And some of the people like the Galen Network, the Reinhard Galen Network, which is actually the origin of German intelligence, the BND, comes from the Galen Org, the Galen Network, who was recruited into working for the CIA after World War II by Dulles and Donovan.
[03:42:08.451 --> 03:42:09.632]  Very famous, very well known.
[03:42:09.632 --> 03:42:10.412]  And guess what?
[03:42:10.412 --> 03:42:12.513]  Galen, Otto Skorzeny, they train
[03:42:13.809 --> 03:42:18.212]  Groups in the Ukraine, which are still there.
[03:42:18.212 --> 03:42:22.955]  That's why we have tiny mustache men, people, followers in the Ukraine.
[03:42:22.955 --> 03:42:23.415]  There you go.
[03:42:23.415 --> 03:42:29.840]  That's the holdovers, the descendants of Gladio right there.
[03:42:29.840 --> 03:42:32.421]  That's how to make sense of all this.
[03:42:32.421 --> 03:42:36.244]  Doesn't mean that we're being run by Italian Gladio.
[03:42:37.887 --> 03:42:39.589]  World Cold War mobsters.
[03:42:39.589 --> 03:42:40.830]  That's not what's going on now.
[03:42:40.830 --> 03:42:48.378]  It's the technique, the plan, the strategy, the model is the same that's used in these groups.
[03:42:48.378 --> 03:42:54.223]  And if you don't understand that, then you're not going to understand how all of this stuff is controlled and run and works.
[03:42:54.223 --> 03:42:55.164]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:55.164 --> 03:42:55.625]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:55.625 --> 03:42:56.446]  This is Jay Dyer.
[03:42:56.977 --> 03:43:03.646]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:43:03.646 --> 03:43:05.568]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:43:05.568 --> 03:43:07.090]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[03:43:07.090 --> 03:43:09.874]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[03:43:09.874 --> 03:43:11.896]  And it says political prisoner.
[03:43:12.679 --> 03:43:14.641]  With an image of President Trump.
[03:43:14.641 --> 03:43:17.082]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:43:17.082 --> 03:43:19.224]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:43:19.224 --> 03:43:24.608]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[03:43:24.608 --> 03:43:25.809]  Jail background.
[03:43:25.809 --> 03:43:26.850]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:43:26.850 --> 03:43:30.993]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:43:30.993 --> 03:43:32.594]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[03:43:32.594 --> 03:43:33.615]  No, I'm not running for President.
[03:43:33.615 --> 03:43:36.157]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[03:43:36.157 --> 03:43:36.937]  Red, white, and blue.
[03:43:36.937 --> 03:43:37.818]  Alex Jones for President.
[03:43:38.499 --> 03:43:41.363]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[03:43:41.363 --> 03:43:43.245]  Great way to fund the operation.
[03:43:43.245 --> 03:43:52.498]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:43:57.037 --> 03:44:01.202]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[03:44:01.202 --> 03:44:04.947]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[03:44:04.947 --> 03:44:07.329]  There is a bulletin from PBS News.
[03:44:07.329 --> 03:44:10.193]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[03:44:10.193 --> 03:44:12.255]  This is a different kind of war.
[03:44:13.056 --> 03:44:17.499]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[03:44:17.499 --> 03:44:20.921]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[03:44:20.921 --> 03:44:24.944]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[03:44:24.944 --> 03:44:26.905]  It was almost as if it were a plan in quotes.
[03:44:26.905 --> 03:44:28.606]  It got packed and loaded.
[03:44:29.006 --> 03:44:30.407]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[03:44:30.407 --> 03:44:30.767]  Stop!
[03:44:30.767 --> 03:44:30.948]  Stop!
[03:44:30.948 --> 03:44:32.849]  Stop!
[03:44:32.849 --> 03:44:34.971]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[03:44:34.971 --> 03:44:36.612]  They are nothing but distraction.
[03:44:36.612 --> 03:44:39.754]  You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors.
[03:44:39.754 --> 03:44:41.275]  You silenced those voices.
[03:44:41.275 --> 03:44:45.038]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[03:44:45.038 --> 03:44:51.463]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[03:44:56.601 --> 03:45:00.152]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[03:45:04.898 --> 03:45:06.219]  I want you all to know something.
[03:45:06.219 --> 03:45:08.181]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:45:08.181 --> 03:45:11.723]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[03:45:11.723 --> 03:45:14.665]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:45:14.665 --> 03:45:19.109]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[03:45:19.109 --> 03:45:21.311]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:45:21.311 --> 03:45:24.833]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:45:24.833 --> 03:45:28.296]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[03:45:28.556 --> 03:45:31.417]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[03:45:31.417 --> 03:45:32.458]  Years ago.
[03:45:32.458 --> 03:45:34.539]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[03:45:34.539 --> 03:45:36.519]  Not for a second.
[03:45:36.519 --> 03:45:39.041]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:45:39.041 --> 03:45:41.502]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:45:41.502 --> 03:45:44.643]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[03:45:44.643 --> 03:45:46.184]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[03:45:46.184 --> 03:45:49.285]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:45:56.977 --> 03:46:05.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[03:46:05.140 --> 03:46:06.601]  That is a hellish future.
[03:46:06.601 --> 03:46:15.505]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarshore.com.
[03:46:16.005 --> 03:46:21.586]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:46:21.586 --> 03:46:24.167]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:46:24.167 --> 03:46:29.548]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHore.com.
[03:46:29.548 --> 03:46:33.488]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:46:33.488 --> 03:46:39.369]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you helped keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:46:39.369 --> 03:46:41.450]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[03:46:42.250 --> 03:46:43.310]  Or unsigned copies.
[03:46:43.310 --> 03:46:53.654]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWars4.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[03:46:53.654 --> 03:46:54.694]  This is an InfoWar.
[03:46:54.694 --> 03:46:58.436]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[03:46:58.436 --> 03:47:04.338]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:12.777 --> 03:47:13.977]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.977 --> 03:47:15.238]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:47:15.238 --> 03:47:30.082]  Today in the house we are talking about Gladio and we're talking about how that's a pattern, a technique, a technology for social, disrupting social cohesion through false flags, through terror, through assassinations.
[03:47:30.948 --> 03:47:34.670]  And that was exactly what Gladio did throughout the Cold War.
[03:47:34.670 --> 03:47:37.292]  And we might think, well, yeah, but I mean, it was a Cold War.
[03:47:37.292 --> 03:47:39.213]  So, you know, you got to fight the bad guys.
[03:47:39.213 --> 03:47:42.194]  But it's like, wait a minute, this is all running black market stuff.
[03:47:42.194 --> 03:47:44.816]  It's all funded by heroin, global heroin trade.
[03:47:44.816 --> 03:47:46.117]  So wait, who's the bad guy?
[03:47:47.372 --> 03:47:49.313]  Well, we got to do all that because the bad guys will do it.
[03:47:49.313 --> 03:47:50.614]  Okay, whatever.
[03:47:50.614 --> 03:47:57.997]  I mean, that's the thing is that this whole world order was structured on drug money, money laundering, giant fake banks.
[03:47:57.997 --> 03:48:05.321]  And this model is what the CIA took from the older British model, opium trade, right?
[03:48:05.321 --> 03:48:06.782]  Controlling the sea power.
[03:48:07.887 --> 03:48:09.788]  British Navy, these kinds of things.
[03:48:09.788 --> 03:48:19.294]  The Anglo-American establishment just adopted that same older model of fiat banking, drug warfare, and that's exactly what explains where we are now.
[03:48:19.294 --> 03:48:22.275]  And now they want to seize and control the reins of tech.
[03:48:22.275 --> 03:48:32.421]  That's their key thing, because if we read in Kissinger's World Order, it's absolutely imperative that we control the technology to create the transhumanist future.
[03:48:32.421 --> 03:48:33.822]  So basically that's what Kissinger says.
[03:48:33.822 --> 03:48:37.104]  He says whoever controls the tech will control and run the world in the future.
[03:48:38.470 --> 03:48:40.211]  In other words, technocracy.
[03:48:40.211 --> 03:48:57.517]  So I've been reading through other books about this, like Patrick Wood's book that he wrote with Professor Anthony Sutton, Trilaterals Over Washington, which is about how the same group, that's the same as this, the same group, it's not different, erecting a technocratic global government.
[03:48:57.517 --> 03:48:58.117]  That's the plan.
[03:48:58.117 --> 03:49:07.220]  Now we're going through this step-by-step plan of Dr. Coleman, and the next one he says is that they will induce and create new cults.
[03:49:08.402 --> 03:49:10.643]  Well, that's something we've talked about for so many years.
[03:49:10.643 --> 03:49:17.546]  I wrote two books on all of these cults and how it plays out in Hollywood and all these movies.
[03:49:17.546 --> 03:49:19.787]  Go get my two books at my website.
[03:49:19.787 --> 03:49:20.467]  Go to the shop.
[03:49:20.467 --> 03:49:21.488]  You get signed copies.
[03:49:21.488 --> 03:49:22.728]  Esoteric Hollywood 1 and 2.
[03:49:22.728 --> 03:49:24.789]  I wrote two whole books on this.
[03:49:24.789 --> 03:49:26.630]  And I'm working on a third book on that.
[03:49:26.630 --> 03:49:30.132]  Go get those at Jay's analysis shop.
[03:49:30.132 --> 03:49:33.213]  And he says that these cults will be run by and promoted by
[03:49:34.255 --> 03:49:35.736]  A lot of the counterculture, right?
[03:49:35.736 --> 03:49:46.564]  Oh yeah, let's get into the counterculture, let's get into meditation, and let's get into... And all that is, is funnel people into all these cults, which are run by the same power structure.
[03:49:46.564 --> 03:49:48.865]  Not every cult, but many of the cults, right?
[03:49:48.865 --> 03:49:59.253]  And this is why when we look at Jonestown, we see these odd patterns of, you know, CIA popping up there, and mind control, and all this kind of stuff at Jonestown, and the shady background that Jim Jones has.
[03:50:01.215 --> 03:50:01.896]  Go to my YouTube channel.
[03:50:01.896 --> 03:50:07.479]  I just did an interview with a guy who wrote a big piece on the history of Jonestown, Uncovering New Information.
[03:50:07.479 --> 03:50:08.999]  That's on the top of my YouTube channel.
[03:50:08.999 --> 03:50:10.140]  Go watch that.
[03:50:10.140 --> 03:50:11.641]  We went really deep into that.
[03:50:11.641 --> 03:50:19.345]  And he says that we will build up the cult of aberrant versions of Christianity.
[03:50:19.345 --> 03:50:27.209]  He says that the establishment will promote aberrant versions of Christianity to change it, to move Christianity into the global government.
[03:50:27.882 --> 03:50:31.544]  Along with the other groups that they control, such as the Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:50:31.544 --> 03:50:51.457]  He says that even at this time, that weird mind control cults like Muslim Brotherhood, like ISIS, Al Qaeda, these kinds of things, he says that they are modeled like Jim Jones style cults and like Son of Sam type cults to create assassins, to create crazy patsies that will go out and do crazy things.
[03:50:52.157 --> 03:51:09.772]  Those are great breeding grounds for recruiting these creeps and weirdos and, you know, basically mentally deficient people who are in cults that are then unstable and manipulated them to do radical actions or terror actions or assassinations, right?
[03:51:09.772 --> 03:51:12.815]  And we see the same thing with the recent shooting in Nashville, right?
[03:51:12.815 --> 03:51:15.397]  People who have mental problems, mental instability.
[03:51:15.397 --> 03:51:18.540]  I don't know if that person was in a cult, but you could say that the whole thing is basically a cult.
[03:51:19.051 --> 03:51:23.574]  I mean, essentially the whole normie world, the NPC world, is a giant cult.
[03:51:23.574 --> 03:51:26.396]  Just look at the last three years of KOOF.
[03:51:26.396 --> 03:51:37.844]  Trust the science, put your mask on, take your mask off, put it on, take it off, off, on, off, on, off, on, take it off, put it on, put it on, take it off.
[03:51:37.844 --> 03:51:40.185]  Trust the science, I am sorry.
[03:51:40.185 --> 03:51:43.708]  What a foul she did, literally just gaslighting everybody every day.
[03:51:43.708 --> 03:51:45.409]  Changing it, contradicting himself.
[03:51:47.469 --> 03:51:49.810]  That's cult mentality.
[03:51:49.810 --> 03:51:54.951]  Export liberation theology and liberation feminist movements across the world.
[03:51:54.951 --> 03:51:57.452]  Oh, we got to go to all these countries to help the women.
[03:51:57.452 --> 03:52:00.513]  Oh, we're there to help free the women from oppression.
[03:52:00.513 --> 03:52:07.215]  Meanwhile, this power structure is intent on destroying women and destroying their identity.
[03:52:08.129 --> 03:52:11.450]  And destroying populations, destroying children, which is what women do.
[03:52:11.450 --> 03:52:12.630]  Women birth children.
[03:52:12.630 --> 03:52:14.430]  I know it's a revolutionary statement, right?
[03:52:14.430 --> 03:52:19.351]  Like Brave New World says, that in the future you can't say women give birth to kids.
[03:52:19.351 --> 03:52:20.332]  But here we are.
[03:52:20.332 --> 03:52:23.212]  16.
[03:52:23.212 --> 03:52:32.414]  Collapse the existing world economies to engender political chaos and then to integrate it into this CBDC global fiat Fedcoin.
[03:52:33.715 --> 03:52:36.258]  Now, he says that they would push this cashless stuff.
[03:52:36.258 --> 03:52:39.501]  He was writing this back in the 80s and 90s, so he was way ahead of time, right?
[03:52:39.501 --> 03:52:40.202]  Absolutely.
[03:52:40.202 --> 03:52:44.406]  Here we are, BIS, FedCoin, all coming now.
[03:52:44.406 --> 03:52:53.035]  Bank for National Settlements, the giant triple chin dude said that we will have FedCoin and we'll shut your wallet off when you're a bad boy.
[03:52:53.035 --> 03:52:53.796]  Take control of
[03:52:54.929 --> 03:53:07.257]  Domestic policies in the US, that is the CFR and the elite controlling all domestic policies, including at the state level, so they want to undermine the state firewall.
[03:53:07.257 --> 03:53:13.881]  Give full support to international bodies such as the UN, International Monetary Fund, BIS, and the World Court.
[03:53:13.881 --> 03:53:16.623]  And that's exactly what we saw in the last three years.
[03:53:16.623 --> 03:53:17.723]  Oh, we got to listen to the UN.
[03:53:17.723 --> 03:53:21.346]  The CDC is going to pass on and hand off.
[03:53:21.346 --> 03:53:23.167]  Oh, we just do whatever the UN tells us.
[03:53:23.877 --> 03:53:25.059]  And who tells them what to do?
[03:53:25.059 --> 03:53:26.761]  Oh, the Rockefeller Foundation and Bill Gates.
[03:53:26.761 --> 03:53:28.283]  So we do what they say.
[03:53:28.283 --> 03:53:28.664]  Why?
[03:53:28.664 --> 03:53:30.486]  Because they say so.
[03:53:30.486 --> 03:53:31.107]  Says who?
[03:53:31.107 --> 03:53:32.269]  Them.
[03:53:32.269 --> 03:53:33.030]  Why do we follow them?
[03:53:33.030 --> 03:53:33.591]  Because they say so.
[03:53:34.624 --> 03:53:37.686]  Penetrate and subvert all the governments.
[03:53:37.686 --> 03:53:41.347]  Now this sounds, oh that's conspiracy theory, that's so conspiratorial.
[03:53:41.347 --> 03:53:45.309]  How is Dr. Coleman saying that they plan to penetrate and subvert all the world governments?
[03:53:45.309 --> 03:53:47.430]  Oh and what did Klaus say last year?
[03:53:47.430 --> 03:53:49.591]  We will penetrate the continents of the world.
[03:53:49.591 --> 03:53:51.452]  We will penetrate them all.
[03:53:51.452 --> 03:53:57.876]  We will have our minions in all of the world's governments and parliaments.
[03:53:57.876 --> 03:54:02.118]  And didn't he say, oh and we now already control most of the world's parliaments?
[03:54:02.118 --> 03:54:02.858]  Remember he said that.
[03:54:04.065 --> 03:54:05.006]  Hello.
[03:54:05.006 --> 03:54:06.607]  So this wasn't a conspiracy theory.
[03:54:06.607 --> 03:54:09.029]  This was a plan.
[03:54:09.029 --> 03:54:24.721]  Organize and control worldwide terror groups, including entities like Red Brigade, entities like ISIS, Al Qaeda, all these crazed, crazy, radical cult groups that then become terror groups.
[03:54:24.721 --> 03:54:27.002]  And that's exactly the purpose of Gladio.
[03:54:27.002 --> 03:54:31.646]  So now remember, they didn't know the name of Gladio when this book was written.
[03:54:32.466 --> 03:54:47.371]  And yet, Dr. Coleman talks about, for example, P2 being involved in the death of Grace Kelly, the actress, who married King Rainier, Prince Rainier of Monaco.
[03:54:47.371 --> 03:54:48.031]  And why did that?
[03:54:48.031 --> 03:55:00.716]  Well, Prince Rainier made the Illuminate Confirm mad because there was a dirty deal that went down in regard to P2 having, and Gladio, moving heroin into Monaco.
[03:55:02.145 --> 03:55:06.326]  And that was organized and run, according to Dr. Coleman, by Kissinger.
[03:55:06.326 --> 03:55:13.827]  And I guess Prince Rainier didn't do exactly what he was supposed to do, and so that's what, according to Dr. Coleman, led to the demise of Grace Kelly.
[03:55:13.827 --> 03:55:15.447]  Now, that's a theory, right?
[03:55:15.447 --> 03:55:16.608]  That's a theory.
[03:55:16.608 --> 03:55:22.549]  However, that this was going on in Monaco and there was P2 and all this, that is not theory.
[03:55:22.549 --> 03:55:29.930]  In fact, one of the famous books that was considered wild conspiracy theory back in 1985 when it was written is the famous
[03:55:30.712 --> 03:55:43.115]  David Yalop book in God's name, which is a book investigating the Vatican Bank, the P2, the CIA, and the suspicious death of Pope John Paul I, who was Pope for 33 days.
[03:55:43.115 --> 03:55:46.935]  And then he mysteriously died of what they call a heart attack, but appears to have been probably a poisoning.
[03:55:46.935 --> 03:56:00.258]  Now, what's interesting about this is that he talks about all these figures that in his research, such as Opus Dei, such as the Bologna bombing, the involvement of these criminal organizations,
[03:56:01.303 --> 03:56:07.044]  And the only thing he leaves out is the name, because he wrote this prior to anyone knowing the name of Gladio.
[03:56:07.044 --> 03:56:10.025]  Well, it turns out that wasn't all conspiracy there.
[03:56:10.025 --> 03:56:11.285]  It was true.
[03:56:11.285 --> 03:56:15.026]  PhD thesis, NATO secret armies.
[03:56:15.026 --> 03:56:15.526]  It's all true.
[03:56:15.526 --> 03:56:17.626]  It was called Gladio.
[03:56:17.626 --> 03:56:20.347]  Operation Gladio.
[03:56:20.347 --> 03:56:21.727]  That's what Dr. Coleman's talking about.
[03:56:21.727 --> 03:56:23.587]  They just didn't know the name of the operation.
[03:56:23.587 --> 03:56:26.128]  They had all the information.
[03:56:26.128 --> 03:56:28.128]  And then, oh, it turns out, yes, it was called Gladio.
[03:56:29.016 --> 03:56:34.139]  Now, we're not being run by right-wing Christians.
[03:56:34.139 --> 03:56:38.502]  This crazy conspiracy theory that, oh, it's the right-wing Christians running everything.
[03:56:38.502 --> 03:56:39.963]  No, no, no.
[03:56:39.963 --> 03:56:40.984]  It's not right-wing Christians.
[03:56:40.984 --> 03:56:48.989]  It's technocrats above any of these kind of ideologies, and they use ideologies to control people.
[03:56:48.989 --> 03:56:56.634]  And so the last plan that he says is that ultimately take control of education in America to promote all forms of sexual deviancy.
[03:56:57.566 --> 03:57:06.189]  So that the Malthusian agenda of overpopulation and energy control and scarcity can be normalized.
[03:57:06.189 --> 03:57:08.370]  And here's the crux of it all.
[03:57:08.370 --> 03:57:18.994]  The overall agenda is the control of all energy and population, meaning not just getting the numbers down, but controlling and managing everything, every day, all day long by everybody.
[03:57:18.994 --> 03:57:26.057]  Banning the cars, banning the stoves, euthanasia, death care, banning the meat, banning travel, banning families, banning men,
[03:57:26.966 --> 03:57:28.207]  I intend to take the InfoWars
[03:57:52.401 --> 03:57:56.031]  Armored truck out, or the InfoWars tank as it's so lovingly called.
[03:57:56.031 --> 03:58:00.362]  You came through yesterday and shopped at InfoWarsStore.com, so I'm gonna be able to take the truck out.
[03:58:46.749 --> 03:58:59.415]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[03:58:59.415 --> 03:59:01.176]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[03:59:01.176 --> 03:59:02.957]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[03:59:03.351 --> 03:59:06.153]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[03:59:06.153 --> 03:59:07.875]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[03:59:07.875 --> 03:59:10.377]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[03:59:10.377 --> 03:59:14.740]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[03:59:14.740 --> 03:59:20.465]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[03:59:20.465 --> 03:59:25.449]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[03:59:25.449 --> 03:59:28.592]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the
[03:59:28.732 --> 03:59:33.254]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
