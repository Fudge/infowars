[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]  [Music]
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.360]  It's Saturday, March 4th.
[00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:10.667]  We've got a very special broadcast today.
[00:00:11.248 --> 00:00:13.329]  Very special guest in the studio.
[00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.209]  InfoWars.
[00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.370]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.850]   Well I've been talking to her on the phone for years but never met her.
[00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.048]  She's a ballot texan who lives outside Austin.
[00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:29.609]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:29.198 --> 00:00:29.999]  Rosie and Barb.
[00:00:31.547 --> 00:00:36.269]  Lenny has a lot of courage, she's really interesting, and she's going to be with us in studio in the second hour today.
[00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:40.611]  It's high noon in 45 seconds, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:47.374]  We've got a big first hour of masses of breaking news and big developments in the Great Awakening that's here.
[00:00:48.254 --> 00:00:58.219]  But before we go any further, I want to air a very special Gregg Reese report that documents where we're going and how to stop the New World Order's neo-feudalistic technocracy.
[00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:02.376]   Safety committees of the revolution.
[00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:09.052]  Here's that report and a little bit of Roseanne Barr's latest comedy and then we will kick off the main transmission.
[00:01:09.092 --> 00:01:09.873]  We are live.
[00:01:14.295 --> 00:01:18.058]  We Americans are under attack by our own government.
[00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:23.282]  We, the people, have no choice but to once again defend our freedom.
[00:01:23.943 --> 00:01:28.406]  This has all happened before, and we can learn much from the American Revolution.
[00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:38.534]  Starting in 1763, to pay for debts incurred from a war with France, the British began enforcing new taxes on the American colonies.
[00:01:39.395 --> 00:01:49.462]  In response to this, the colonies set up their own parallel government based on a simple structure of three committees delegated to voice the will of the people.
[00:01:50.062 --> 00:01:53.224]  A committee of correspondence to disseminate information.
[00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:57.927]  A committee of inspection to enforce Continental Congress decisions.
[00:01:58.588 --> 00:02:06.133]  And the most important of the three, a committee of safety to act as general executive in the absence of legal authority.
[00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:19.736]  These committees stemmed from each community of all the colonies and each and every local committee of safety had two missions to provide military support and monitor political affairs.
[00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:28.761]  Each community delegated its own representatives to speak on their behalf at the county level and then at the state level.
[00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:38.345]  Where state legislatures are thereby formed and senators are elected to represent the overall interests of the people in that state.
[00:02:38.965 --> 00:02:47.189]  With these committees, the 13 colonies honorably created a parallel government that lawfully nullified British rule.
[00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:57.054]  This compelled the Crown to take it back by force, which was met by an honorable and lawful defense of the colonies, known as the American Revolution.
[00:02:57.794 --> 00:03:02.699]  The three-committee structure that made up this parallel government inspired our U.S.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.064]  Constitution, a concept of government based upon delegation.
[00:03:07.725 --> 00:03:09.747]  Individuals were not elected to rule.
[00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:14.011]  Their only purpose was to facilitate and implement the will of the people.
[00:03:14.612 --> 00:03:18.756]  It was a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[00:03:19.597 --> 00:03:27.705]  Each state was considered to be its own country, which was freely subordinating aspects of its own authority to a federal government.
[00:03:28.225 --> 00:03:39.535]  Lawfully speaking, this has never changed, but the federal government of the United States has become bloated with loyalists to the City of London and enemies of We The People.
[00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:53.801]  For well over a century, we the people have been coerced into becoming voluntary slaves to a multinational corporate power structure, which has increasingly dumbed us down more and more with each generation.
[00:03:54.681 --> 00:03:57.402]  Unconstitutional amendments have been enacted.
[00:03:57.982 --> 00:04:01.463]  Constitutional limits of representation have been ignored.
[00:04:01.984 --> 00:04:07.906]  And by accepting Federal Reserve banknotes, we have made ourselves a dishonorable nation of debtors.
[00:04:08.926 --> 00:04:11.967]  By continually contracting with the corporate U.S.
[00:04:12.188 --> 00:04:15.549]  being operated out of the Washington, D.C.
[00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:23.973]  city-state, Americans are perpetually surrendering their constitutional sovereignty in return for corporate benefits.
[00:04:24.993 --> 00:04:28.096]  We share a common enemy with our founding fathers.
[00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:30.237]  Today we call them globalists.
[00:04:30.698 --> 00:04:32.639]  Back then, they called them British.
[00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.343]  A foreign power exploiting the will and destiny of Americans.
[00:04:37.983 --> 00:04:41.126]  And back then, their remedy was the Committee of Safety.
[00:04:41.977 --> 00:04:43.437]  This is happening again today.
[00:04:43.938 --> 00:04:47.019]  Communities are forming their own committees of safety.
[00:04:47.539 --> 00:05:04.224]  An excellent example is Santa Rosa County, Florida, where the Recall Florida movement sprang from, which seeks to empower the citizens of Florida with the ability to recall county commissioners for corruption, malfeasance, and neglect of duty.
[00:05:05.194 --> 00:05:10.558]  The county sheriff is charged with upholding the supreme law of the Constitution.
[00:05:11.038 --> 00:05:23.767]  And with your county government in line with your county sheriff, citizens of that county will have the lawful parallel government they need to liberate themselves from contracts made with the corporate U.S.
[00:05:24.167 --> 00:05:31.412]  Because the powers held by the sheriff supersede those of any government official when in the jurisdiction of that county.
[00:05:32.353 --> 00:05:37.396]  The PSYOP today is meant to make you feel dependent upon the federal government.
[00:05:37.956 --> 00:05:40.137]  But that has always been your choice.
[00:05:40.737 --> 00:05:42.038]  And it's not the only choice.
[00:05:42.618 --> 00:05:47.961]  You can contact your local sheriff and ask him about his oath to uphold the Constitution.
[00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:50.663]  You can form committees of safety.
[00:05:51.323 --> 00:05:54.685]  And you can lawfully purge your local government of corruption.
[00:05:55.485 --> 00:05:58.527]  But it requires action, and time is quickly running out.
[00:05:59.405 --> 00:06:02.405]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:06:02.405 --> 00:06:27.905]  How many of you has got the backs?
[00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:29.905]  [laughter]
[00:06:29.905 --> 00:06:30.905]  [applause]
[00:06:30.905 --> 00:06:31.905]  [cheering]
[00:06:31.923 --> 00:06:34.264]  A few of yous, you probably had to get it right.
[00:06:34.464 --> 00:06:36.025]  Were you forced to get the vacs?
[00:06:36.445 --> 00:06:36.805]  Yeah.
[00:06:37.265 --> 00:06:41.007]  Boy, what a... That makes me mad they forced people to get the vacs.
[00:06:41.327 --> 00:06:44.568]  I hope they have to pay for that, what they did to us.
[00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:52.732]  Did you get any of that myocarditis or the facial paralysis or, you know, the adult dropping dead syndrome or any of that sh**?
[00:06:53.852 --> 00:06:54.693]  Did any of that?
[00:06:55.593 --> 00:06:56.854]  What happened to people?
[00:06:58.362 --> 00:07:04.686]  That they start believing, for some reason, that this government had their best interest at heart?
[00:07:04.706 --> 00:07:05.867]  Ha ha ha!
[00:07:06.007 --> 00:07:08.488]  Ha ha ha!
[00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:12.011]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:07:12.811 --> 00:07:13.311]  What?
[00:07:13.311 --> 00:07:16.150]  [APPLAUSE]
[00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.171]  What?
[00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:22.650]  (audience laughing)
[00:07:22.871 --> 00:07:32.718]  My whole family's a bunch of libtards, you know, as I said, and they always called me a conspiracy theorist the whole time, but everything I said turned out to be true.
[00:07:33.059 --> 00:07:34.500]  Did they apologize?
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.081]  Hell no!
[00:07:38.223 --> 00:07:39.564]  They never apologize.
[00:07:41.225 --> 00:07:42.706]  They never admit they're wrong, do they?
[00:07:43.286 --> 00:07:47.830]  Now, my whole family is sick, what, with blood clots and this and that and the other.
[00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:48.910]  They're all sick.
[00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.512]  I'm the only healthy one.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.800]  I'm gonna miss them.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.800]  [laughter]
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.800]  [applause]
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.800]  [laughter]
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:18.591]   What happened to people that are How can they line up to take these shots from this government, knowing that this government gave smallpox-infested blankets to the First Nations people, gave syphilis to black prisoners in Tuskegee,
[00:08:19.591 --> 00:08:26.337]  Told us there was weapons of mass destruction before they leveled Iraq and destroyed Libya.
[00:08:26.938 --> 00:08:31.202]  Told us Fen-Phen was safe and then all the fucking fat people died.
[00:08:35.266 --> 00:08:36.147]  What happened?
[00:08:36.957 --> 00:08:39.718]  And they're like, hey, can I get that booster?
[00:08:40.058 --> 00:08:43.240]  Can I get that shot and those 15 boosters?
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.582]  Would you mind giving my daughter here that shot right in her eyeball after she's born?
[00:08:48.942 --> 00:08:51.243]  Could you give her 10 of those right in the eyeball?
[00:08:51.543 --> 00:08:54.765]  Could you give her a shot right in her little baby clitoris?
[00:08:54.845 --> 00:08:57.526]  Could you do that for me, Mr. Biden?
[00:08:58.005 --> 00:09:00.005]  What's wrong with PayPal?
[00:09:00.005 --> 00:09:19.005]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:09:20.005 --> 00:09:23.005]  The war is over.
[00:09:23.005 --> 00:09:27.005]  The war is over.
[00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:48.005]  [Music]
[00:09:48.276 --> 00:09:51.907]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:54.435]  It's Saturday, March 4, 2023.
[00:09:56.528 --> 00:10:04.994]  It is 12.10 exactly Central Standard Time, and I have been gone for close to a week, though I did host about half of the shows.
[00:10:05.794 --> 00:10:18.723]  I have dedicated myself to spending more time with family, with my parents, and with my children and others, because I've just been working seven days a week for 28 years, and I've just been committed to do that.
[00:10:19.343 --> 00:10:22.905]  I'm doing some catching up, even though the world's in a more intense, insane place than ever.
[00:10:23.465 --> 00:10:32.590]  I've committed to take off at least five, six days, purely, every month to spend it exclusively with my family, because that is so important to do.
[00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.813]  Who knows how long we'll even be here with the looming threat of nuclear war.
[00:10:36.853 --> 00:10:43.496]  But I also commit to you to do more special broadcasts that actually increase the overall amount of time we're on air.
[00:10:43.516 --> 00:10:47.759]  We're going to be here live today for several hours, commercial free, on this Saturday.
[00:10:48.539 --> 00:10:52.144]  And then I'll be back tomorrow night 4 to 8 p.m.
[00:10:52.204 --> 00:10:57.893]  with my show and then Sunday live here on the InfoWars radio slash TV network.
[00:10:58.393 --> 00:11:03.861]  Okay, we got a big live transmission that's going to go for at least the next two hours.
[00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:04.803]  We can go as long as we want.
[00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:12.368]  We are scheduled to have Roseanne Barr, who's going to arrive at the studio here very soon, in studio with us.
[00:11:12.608 --> 00:11:14.389]  Very funny lady, very smart lady.
[00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.650]  Eccentric, but who isn't?
[00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.091]  Who's interesting and smart.
[00:11:18.731 --> 00:11:21.373]  And she's coming here with her family, so I look forward to meeting her in person.
[00:11:21.773 --> 00:11:26.855]  I've talked to her over the phone for many, many years, but we never got it set up for her to come on the show.
[00:11:26.896 --> 00:11:29.017]  But she doesn't just live in Hawaii now.
[00:11:29.797 --> 00:11:31.758]  She lives outside Austin part of the year.
[00:11:34.099 --> 00:11:35.480]  She's going to be in studio with us.
[00:11:35.681 --> 00:11:37.462]  I really, really look forward to that.
[00:11:37.502 --> 00:11:39.504]  She's invited me many times out to her place in Fredericksburg.
[00:11:39.924 --> 00:11:41.766]  I'm just always working so much, I haven't been able to do it.
[00:11:42.547 --> 00:11:46.650]  But we do really look forward to her because she has a lot of courage and has been standing up for the system.
[00:11:47.111 --> 00:11:50.314]  And back when I got cancelled four years ago, they cancelled her.
[00:11:52.136 --> 00:11:53.337]  Right along with me.
[00:11:53.658 --> 00:11:58.042]  Okay, the theme of this transmission today is the Great Awakening is here.
[00:11:58.182 --> 00:11:59.583]  The chain reaction is taking place.
[00:12:00.164 --> 00:12:03.867]  Humanity, a large segment of it, is waking up at an explosive rate.
[00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:08.432]  But how is that going to affect the globalists and how are they going to strike back?
[00:12:08.592 --> 00:12:17.125]   So let me again give you An anecdotal example, and you can see all the real world examples yourself around you, and describe what happened.
[00:12:17.625 --> 00:12:28.712]  I went for about six days with my family to a vacation destination in Mexico, and I got mobbed at the Texas airport in Austin.
[00:12:29.553 --> 00:12:31.694]  I got mobbed continually in Mexico.
[00:12:31.714 --> 00:12:33.796]  I was kind of hiding out just on the beach.
[00:12:35.377 --> 00:12:43.721]   I got mobbed everywhere, and flying back out of Cancun yesterday, We got to the airport about two hours before the flight.
[00:12:43.741 --> 00:12:45.023]  We got through security really quickly.
[00:12:45.744 --> 00:12:54.718]  And so I went and sat in a corner of a restaurant that was probably only a third full.
[00:12:56.099 --> 00:13:02.466]  And basically everyone in the restaurant came over and shook my hand and said, we know about the New World Order.
[00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:04.428]  The Great Awakening's here.
[00:13:04.448 --> 00:13:05.289]  We're going to beat them together.
[00:13:05.309 --> 00:13:06.350]  It was like Fight Club.
[00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.734]  Because I was sitting there for about an hour with my family, just ordering some food, hamburgers and things.
[00:13:11.535 --> 00:13:18.411]   And the Mexican waiters We're all fans, and we're talking about what I had done on the show a few days before.
[00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:23.092]  Like, we noticed you were live Monday and Tuesday, but now you're going back to Texas today.
[00:13:23.152 --> 00:13:25.153]  We're going to be tuning in Sunday.
[00:13:25.193 --> 00:13:27.033]  Are you going to be doing a special show Saturday?
[00:13:27.754 --> 00:13:29.334]  I mean, that's the Mexican waiter.
[00:13:30.094 --> 00:13:33.855]  Then Mexican nationals who were visiting from Mexico City came over.
[00:13:34.635 --> 00:13:40.377]  Then people from Germany, people from Wales, England, people from South Korea.
[00:13:41.753 --> 00:14:07.003]   I mean on and on and on and I'm sitting there for an hour getting up taking pictures and we're looking around the restaurant and I'm like wait a minute we're sitting here in the corner in the back the place is two-thirds empty most of the tables are open and my wife goes yeah everyone has come over and is a listener and folks it would be like this we're at this you know little It's a big hotel.
[00:14:07.103 --> 00:14:08.303]  They got those palapas.
[00:14:08.343 --> 00:14:10.324]  You gotta pay like 100 bucks a day or 200 bucks a day for work.
[00:14:10.705 --> 00:14:11.525]  We weren't getting those.
[00:14:11.865 --> 00:14:13.646]  We were just out in the sun throwing football, doing that.
[00:14:14.227 --> 00:14:17.048]  And like, the Mexicans are like, oh, we love your work, Mr. Jones.
[00:14:17.489 --> 00:14:19.029]  You just get a free palapa every day.
[00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.152]  And oh, here, would you like, we'd order dinner.
[00:14:23.492 --> 00:14:25.333]  They go, would you like some free lobster?
[00:14:26.534 --> 00:14:27.934]  Would you like some free tequila?
[00:14:27.974 --> 00:14:28.675]  And I'm like, stop.
[00:14:29.875 --> 00:14:32.257]  And again, it's not me bragging, oh, I'm famous, oh, I'm successful.
[00:14:33.424 --> 00:14:37.647]  The enemy has tried to destroy me with everything they've got.
[00:14:39.088 --> 00:14:42.170]  They have thrown every lie, every twisted disinformation piece.
[00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.511]  They have tried to make me Satan.
[00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:46.733]  And it's not that I'm that good as a talk show host.
[00:14:47.673 --> 00:14:49.354]  Our information's powerful, our guests are powerful.
[00:14:49.795 --> 00:14:56.099]  It's that people hate the system so much that they then just go, well, if the system's attacking you, you must be good.
[00:14:56.559 --> 00:15:00.562]  And I got told that by so many Mexicans.
[00:15:02.981 --> 00:15:08.467]  We took the ferry over to Isla Mujeres and spent a couple days over there on a little beautiful island.
[00:15:08.947 --> 00:15:10.789]  I've been going since I was a kid when there was basically nothing on it.
[00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:11.590]  Now it's built up.
[00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:15.073]  And it was insane.
[00:15:15.393 --> 00:15:16.455]  Oh, your drink's free.
[00:15:17.335 --> 00:15:17.576]  Why?
[00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:18.416]  We love your work.
[00:15:19.357 --> 00:15:21.640]  Oh, that bag of chips your daughter wants, just, it's free.
[00:15:23.976 --> 00:15:27.218]  And then the Mexicans are trying to give us beer, give us tequila, everywhere.
[00:15:27.658 --> 00:15:28.058]  I'm like, why?
[00:15:28.098 --> 00:15:29.259]  They go, sir, we love you.
[00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:32.060]  We know when the system comes after somebody, they are good.
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:32.841]  We are with you.
[00:15:33.221 --> 00:15:33.821]  We love you.
[00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:37.383]  I mean, it was so intense, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:37.483 --> 00:15:40.164]  It was insane, the level of support.
[00:15:41.245 --> 00:15:42.165]  Because I don't get out a lot.
[00:15:42.565 --> 00:15:45.367]  I might go to dinner every two weeks with my wife.
[00:15:46.007 --> 00:15:47.588]  I might go see a movie every three, four weeks.
[00:15:48.488 --> 00:15:51.130]  I just work, go home, cook dinner, hang out.
[00:15:52.116 --> 00:15:52.937]  Read books to my daughter.
[00:15:53.297 --> 00:15:56.540]  She goes to bed at like nine o'clock, maybe watch a TV show or something until 10, go to bed.
[00:15:58.341 --> 00:16:00.323]  My R&R is like two hours a day.
[00:16:01.824 --> 00:16:02.665]  And so I don't get out.
[00:16:04.706 --> 00:16:05.647]  All I'm getting is love.
[00:16:06.828 --> 00:16:17.197]  Now, since Trump got elected six plus years ago, I, again, I would shake, if I went downtown or anywhere, I would shake a hundred hands.
[00:16:18.274 --> 00:16:22.396]  But I would get a couple FUs, Russian agent, we're going to put you in prison, you're going to die, blah, blah, blah.
[00:16:24.236 --> 00:16:24.757]  None of that.
[00:16:25.757 --> 00:16:40.260]   And I've taken three or four trips on business and on family leisure in the last three, four months, and I've not had one person Get in my face or tell me F you.
[00:16:40.841 --> 00:16:46.185]  I see a few lepers looking at me just going with their mouths over there and they just don't even know what to say and they kind of just keep looking at me.
[00:16:46.845 --> 00:16:51.188]  I just smile at them but they're not coming up getting in my face because they know they got screwed.
[00:16:51.448 --> 00:16:52.890]  They know they got lied to with the poison shots.
[00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.011]  They know I'm right in the main.
[00:16:55.331 --> 00:16:56.192]  They know I'm real.
[00:16:56.232 --> 00:16:57.473]  They know I'm not out to get people.
[00:16:57.713 --> 00:16:58.834]  They know I'm not this villain.
[00:16:58.894 --> 00:17:01.296]  So I'm gonna give you the good news here.
[00:17:01.316 --> 00:17:02.717]  This isn't me talking about myself.
[00:17:03.137 --> 00:17:05.299]  Again, I've said this a hundred times because it's so critical to understand.
[00:17:06.147 --> 00:17:15.895]  You are blessed if you're a school teacher, or a farmer, or a bus driver, or a police officer, or a doctor, or you work at a bank.
[00:17:16.475 --> 00:17:18.137]  You got your life, you got your family.
[00:17:18.657 --> 00:17:19.838]  You want to go speak at city council?
[00:17:19.878 --> 00:17:20.719]  You can, you should.
[00:17:20.739 --> 00:17:21.880]  You want to go to the school board?
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.681]  Great, you speak out.
[00:17:23.021 --> 00:17:24.602]  But you're not a public person.
[00:17:24.702 --> 00:17:25.763]  You get to be private.
[00:17:27.164 --> 00:17:30.387]  And the enemies of freedom have tried to make my life a living hell.
[00:17:31.688 --> 00:17:32.649]  They've tried to destroy me.
[00:17:33.502 --> 00:17:51.051]  Anybody else has stuck their head up or resisted them, and I can tell you as a gauge, kind of like you get a turkey for Christmas or Thanksgiving and you buy the metal thermometer, you know, because the old one broke or whatever, and you stick the thermometer in the turkey every hour or so to see if you've gotten the middle of it cooked.
[00:17:52.292 --> 00:17:53.772]  And that's all I am is a thermometer.
[00:17:54.653 --> 00:17:56.214]  I'm a gauge because I'm well known.
[00:17:56.254 --> 00:17:57.114]  My face is out there.
[00:17:57.935 --> 00:17:58.695]  And let me explain something.
[00:17:58.715 --> 00:18:02.497]  These aren't just people interested to take a photo with me and say they like me.
[00:18:04.229 --> 00:18:04.409]  No.
[00:18:06.229 --> 00:18:07.890]  I would ask the people, I'd say, oh, really?
[00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:09.490]  What's the last time you tuned in?
[00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:10.870]  Two days ago, you were talking about this.
[00:18:11.751 --> 00:18:15.271]  Or they'll start telling you, oh, I was tuned in last few days to Owen.
[00:18:15.711 --> 00:18:17.112]  We love Owen, but when are you back?
[00:18:17.392 --> 00:18:17.892]  When are you back?
[00:18:17.912 --> 00:18:19.312]  I'm like, well, I'm back tomorrow.
[00:18:19.352 --> 00:18:19.672]  We thought so.
[00:18:19.692 --> 00:18:19.992]  We thought so.
[00:18:20.012 --> 00:18:20.252]  What time?
[00:18:20.272 --> 00:18:20.572]  What time?
[00:18:21.232 --> 00:18:25.133]  I got asked at least 10 times in the Cancun airport when I was live again.
[00:18:26.013 --> 00:18:28.394]  And before I could get out of my mouth a couple of times, they go, noon?
[00:18:28.454 --> 00:18:28.654]  Noon?
[00:18:28.473 --> 00:18:30.473]  or will it be two o'clock?
[00:18:30.473 --> 00:18:40.114]   So your word of mouth, you spread the word about the broadcast, all of you, has caused a chain reaction.
[00:18:40.114 --> 00:18:50.114]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:47.182]  Almost all the other big talk show hosts, members of Congress, governors, foreign leaders, they're all talking about the New World Order.
[00:18:48.542 --> 00:18:55.384]  I want to just salute the audience and say you are the heart of the resistance worldwide to this evil tyranny, and you have done an incredible job.
[00:18:56.304 --> 00:18:57.264]  And I just want to let you know that.
[00:18:57.284 --> 00:19:03.906]  So despite all the attacks, all the persecution, and all the lies, they just intensify by the day, and they're trying to set me up, put me in prison right now.
[00:19:04.671 --> 00:19:10.494]  But at the end of the day, I wouldn't really do anything differently because I did it from the heart and did it from a place of truth.
[00:19:10.914 --> 00:19:13.955]  Even the few times I've been wrong about things, I wasn't wrong on purpose.
[00:19:13.975 --> 00:19:14.596]  I was mistaken.
[00:19:16.076 --> 00:19:21.098]  And it's not about me getting praise that, oh, I feel good about things because I'm getting praise.
[00:19:21.138 --> 00:19:21.399]  No, no.
[00:19:21.939 --> 00:19:26.541]  It's knowing that I'm supposedly Satan in the mainstream media.
[00:19:27.081 --> 00:19:28.482]  Hundreds of articles a day.
[00:19:29.841 --> 00:19:32.062]  Thousands and thousands of TV programs a month.
[00:19:32.102 --> 00:19:32.522]  Thousands!
[00:19:33.242 --> 00:19:34.663]  On local news, national, foreign.
[00:19:35.043 --> 00:19:37.684]  Lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying.
[00:19:38.745 --> 00:19:43.667]  And you've got that old great song by Alice Cooper, No More Mr. Nice Guy.
[00:19:44.007 --> 00:19:49.049]  And if you listen to No More Mr. Nice Guy, will you guys print me the lyrics to No More Mr. Nice Guy?
[00:19:49.069 --> 00:19:49.929]  I'm running real quick, thanks.
[00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.231]  He says, I got no friends because they read the papers.
[00:19:54.042 --> 00:19:55.584]  They can't be seen with me.
[00:19:56.305 --> 00:19:59.669]  And I'm feeling real shot down and I'm feeling mean.
[00:20:01.672 --> 00:20:02.032]  I'm not.
[00:20:02.873 --> 00:20:05.597]  Back when Alice Cooper wrote that 35, 40 years ago, this is 40 years ago now.
[00:20:07.034 --> 00:20:10.617]  If the newspapers attacked you, man, you were Posada Non Grata.
[00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:13.058]  That was the unofficial social credit score.
[00:20:13.839 --> 00:20:22.245]  Now those newspapers have less than an 8% approval rating in national polls, so does mainstream corporate broadcast media and all the cable media.
[00:20:22.605 --> 00:20:32.913]  They are so universally or almost universally reviled that the only thing that would hurt me would be if the newspapers started endorsing me.
[00:20:33.666 --> 00:20:37.008]  But see, the arrogant deep state still pretends they've got all the power.
[00:20:37.288 --> 00:20:39.069]  Yeah, they got the power to start World War III.
[00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:49.256]  Yeah, they got the power to do a really horrible stuff and get rid of the borders and allow the fentanyl to be shipped in and promote pedophilia.
[00:20:49.276 --> 00:20:51.638]  But that's their nasty death rattle.
[00:20:52.638 --> 00:20:59.803]  That's their nasty fit-throwing that they are involved in because they know we're winning.
[00:21:00.503 --> 00:21:02.064]  So again, I'm a public figure.
[00:21:02.284 --> 00:21:02.845]  I'm a gauge.
[00:21:04.226 --> 00:21:05.507]  It's like a speedometer on your car.
[00:21:07.208 --> 00:21:10.269]  So I get to know what the real sense of the public is.
[00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.951]  And I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:21:14.952 --> 00:21:16.613]  I'm going to leave it at that because I don't want to get anybody in trouble.
[00:21:18.614 --> 00:21:21.275]  But it's like Fight Club.
[00:21:22.616 --> 00:21:24.097]  I mean, I came back through customs yesterday.
[00:21:26.038 --> 00:21:35.847]   And, uh, They just basically apologized the last time I went through customs that I was even asking questions.
[00:21:36.528 --> 00:21:41.338]  And again, that's the level of awakening and the Fight Club position of this.
[00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:49.375]  That I'm like some gladiator that won the championship or something, and then everything in Rome was basically free for the next year.
[00:21:49.395 --> 00:21:52.578]  And I'm not, again, saying, oh, aren't I cool?
[00:21:53.038 --> 00:21:53.939]  You're the gladiators.
[00:21:54.019 --> 00:21:54.959]  You kept me in the arena.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.421]  This is a composite.
[00:21:56.461 --> 00:21:59.223]  This is a colony organization.
[00:21:59.703 --> 00:22:05.107]  We are individuals, but we're directed by God, and we really are a collective, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:05.708 --> 00:22:09.771]  Not their fake satanic collective, but the collective of Christ energy.
[00:22:12.179 --> 00:22:12.739]  Here's the song.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.881]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing till they got a hold of me.
[00:22:17.901 --> 00:22:26.345]  I opened doors for little old ladies.
[00:22:27.065 --> 00:22:28.566]  I helped the blind to see.
[00:22:28.586 --> 00:22:33.988]  I got no friends cause they read the papers.
[00:22:34.929 --> 00:22:38.130]  They can't be seen with me.
[00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:43.934]  Feeling mean!
[00:22:48.336 --> 00:22:49.156]  No more Mr. Nice Guy!
[00:22:49.176 --> 00:22:52.137]  No more Mr. Clean!
[00:22:53.037 --> 00:22:54.558]  No more Mr. Clean!
[00:22:54.618 --> 00:22:55.298]  No more Mr. Nice Guy!
[00:22:56.698 --> 00:22:57.399]  He's sick!
[00:22:57.939 --> 00:22:59.219]  He's obscene!
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:07.562]  I got no friends cause they read the papers!
[00:23:07.602 --> 00:23:08.862]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:23:10.462 --> 00:23:11.462]  Woo!
[00:23:11.462 --> 00:23:23.462]  [Music]
[00:23:23.462 --> 00:23:27.462]  And I'm feeling real shot down, you know.
[00:23:27.443 --> 00:23:28.724]  I'm getting me.
[00:23:28.864 --> 00:23:39.789]  You know, the last few times I had leftists scream at me and yell at me was months ago.
[00:23:39.809 --> 00:23:42.190]  And they said the same thing in the grocery store.
[00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.450]  They said the same thing in restaurants.
[00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:45.391]  They said the same thing.
[00:23:47.438 --> 00:23:48.258]  At the shopping mall.
[00:23:50.299 --> 00:23:58.323]  They walk over and they go, I can't believe you're even showing your face in public after all the bad things you've done.
[00:23:58.343 --> 00:24:01.225]  I just look at them and I say, I love you.
[00:24:02.646 --> 00:24:04.406]  I hope you didn't take the poison injections.
[00:24:06.688 --> 00:24:08.248]  Or I tell them, you guys are losing.
[00:24:09.069 --> 00:24:09.869]  People are waking up.
[00:24:10.329 --> 00:24:17.589]   So I wanted to give you that report because it's a frontline report from the very Tip of the spear in the fight.
[00:24:17.849 --> 00:24:18.989]  That is this whole organization.
[00:24:19.009 --> 00:24:22.051]  That means you tuning in as well, or just as important as I am or anybody else is.
[00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:27.274]  And yeah, bad things are happening and we've still got a very rough road to go down.
[00:24:29.295 --> 00:24:37.840]  But in the final equation, ladies and gentlemen, the awakening is accelerating and exploding very, very quickly.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.862]  Now, I want to hit their ace in the hole.
[00:24:42.062 --> 00:24:47.408]   And the fact that the central bank digital currencies Aren't coming, they're here.
[00:24:47.428 --> 00:24:54.692]  They're just turning on the new function in your phone, the new function in your thermostat, all this smart stuff.
[00:24:56.633 --> 00:25:05.317]  And I want to get to their face in the hole if we don't say no to it and repudiate it and just let it become the background environment we live in, this artificial environment.
[00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:08.459]  We have to reject this poisonous prison being built around us.
[00:25:08.499 --> 00:25:09.139]  So we've got that.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.542]  Also, we figured this out very, very early.
[00:25:15.185 --> 00:25:19.507]  Three years ago, and we said this is an offensive bioweapon made by Obama.
[00:25:20.127 --> 00:25:36.053]  When he got caught doing it, they moved it to an international controlled firm, EcoHealth Alliance, in China, so they could have plausible deniability about where it came from, but use it against the general population of the world, and let governments use it against the population.
[00:25:36.353 --> 00:25:42.796]  But then if China got too uppity, they would then say that China had done it, and I'm no friend of Xi Jinping and the Chai Kans, believe me.
[00:25:43.658 --> 00:25:46.600]  But this thing was made by Obama in the U.S.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.321]  and deployed.
[00:25:48.001 --> 00:25:50.363]  And so now you have a State Department that was censoring everybody.
[00:25:50.383 --> 00:25:53.965]  They said China was behind it three years ago, two years ago, a year ago.
[00:25:54.346 --> 00:26:00.030]  Now they're saying, yes, the Energy Department and the Department of Defense and the Justice Department have all found it was made.
[00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:00.870]  It's man-made.
[00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:05.694]  Well, you can look at the damn virus under an electron microscope and they can see it's five viruses combined.
[00:26:06.234 --> 00:26:07.335]  They can scan the damn thing.
[00:26:07.355 --> 00:26:07.795]  They've done that.
[00:26:07.815 --> 00:26:08.856]  They know every piece of it.
[00:26:11.098 --> 00:26:25.970]   So, China played along with the deep state leftists to shut down the world, but now because the fights intensify between the globalists and the chi-coms, now they're blaming China as a pretext, again, for war.
[00:26:26.943 --> 00:26:29.245]  And for plausible liability about where the virus came from.
[00:26:29.285 --> 00:26:29.406]  No.
[00:26:29.746 --> 00:26:34.891]  The same people that already had the poison mRNA shots ready, which is admitted, are the ones that created the virus.
[00:26:35.111 --> 00:26:36.012]  It's not our government.
[00:26:36.352 --> 00:26:39.135]  It's the criminal globalists that set up communist China.
[00:26:39.355 --> 00:26:40.817]  They're the ones that set up the poison shot.
[00:26:41.077 --> 00:26:42.338]  They're the ones that set up the UN.
[00:26:42.538 --> 00:26:43.399]  They're the Rockefellers.
[00:26:43.419 --> 00:26:44.160]  They're the Rothschilds.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:45.521]  They're the New World Order.
[00:26:45.781 --> 00:26:49.105]  They're the George Soros puppet masters that play the countries off against each other.
[00:26:49.625 --> 00:26:50.865]  So I'm not anti-government.
[00:26:50.945 --> 00:26:55.527]  I don't want war with the FBI and the police any more than I want war with the fire department.
[00:26:55.787 --> 00:27:02.149]  I want control of our police and military, and our fire department, and our universities, and our banks for the American way.
[00:27:02.689 --> 00:27:18.435]   If a hijacker hijacks the planes and says, I got 20 pounds of bombs on me and a gun, do what I say, you don't go, oh, that's the pilot, American Airlines, or Southwest is to blame, or LL, or Lufthansa, you go, no, we got a hijacker on the plane.
[00:27:18.995 --> 00:27:22.936]  Hijackers have taken over the corporations, the governments, all of it.
[00:27:22.976 --> 00:27:23.976]  They're a globalist cult.
[00:27:24.296 --> 00:27:25.256]  They're the Davos Group.
[00:27:25.336 --> 00:27:26.057]  They're the Bilderberg.
[00:27:26.177 --> 00:27:26.797]  It's the same group.
[00:27:26.917 --> 00:27:27.317]  New World Order.
[00:27:28.817 --> 00:27:29.658]  They're unpopular.
[00:27:30.238 --> 00:27:30.938]  They're horrible.
[00:27:31.418 --> 00:27:32.438]  They're running all this.
[00:27:33.058 --> 00:27:40.463]   And if you want to beat their worldwide cashless society control grid, the social credit score, the carbon taxes, universal basic income, All of it.
[00:27:40.523 --> 00:27:49.587]  We better do it now because they got the handcuffs out and in many countries the handcuffs are going on, sweetheart, like China and Australia and Italy of all places.
[00:27:50.427 --> 00:27:51.308]  So it's going on.
[00:27:54.009 --> 00:27:54.869]  So we got that stuck.
[00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:59.932]  Biden vows to ban all semi-autos including semi-automatic shotguns for bird hunting.
[00:27:59.972 --> 00:28:00.672]  Can't make that up.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:11.284]  Over 30 mayors in the last five years, 20-something in the last two, have been caught either distributing child porn, making child porn, or raping children.
[00:28:12.865 --> 00:28:15.526]  And Booty Judge's best buddy now has been arrested.
[00:28:15.546 --> 00:28:17.547]  Democrat mayor arrested on child porn charges.
[00:28:18.168 --> 00:28:21.089]  Visited Biden Winehouse several times, called Booty Judge his mentor.
[00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:29.373]  Meanwhile, we got all these videos of pastors being arrested to peacefully protest pedophile drag queen time in Canada.
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:31.320]  And so much more.
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.280]  We got that in the stack.
[00:28:32.841 --> 00:28:38.022]  Tucker Carlson says he's got January 6th news coming out next week and that they are lying.
[00:28:38.582 --> 00:28:41.623]  He's only done a preliminary scanning of the 40 plus thousand hours of footage.
[00:28:42.103 --> 00:28:43.083]  This is only part one.
[00:28:43.443 --> 00:28:48.144]  And part one is just going to establish, I can tell you, I talked to him, is going to establish that they're lying.
[00:28:48.764 --> 00:28:49.344]  They're lying here.
[00:28:49.385 --> 00:28:50.045]  They're lying there.
[00:28:50.085 --> 00:28:52.045]  They're lying here, here, here, there, there, there, everywhere.
[00:28:52.605 --> 00:29:02.497]   And then the big juicies are going to come out the next week that they've gotten into now, but they've only ferreted through Some of the footage.
[00:29:03.719 --> 00:29:05.542]  So look for that.
[00:29:07.585 --> 00:29:08.846]  We got to talk about Andrew Tate.
[00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:11.510]  Now have three of the six women saying that was made up.
[00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:12.431]  The media just made it up.
[00:29:13.273 --> 00:29:14.394]  And it was all consensual.
[00:29:15.616 --> 00:29:21.691]   And He now has lost 30 pounds, and now they're saying he has cancer.
[00:29:22.111 --> 00:29:24.472]  And if you look at the photos of him, he looks like absolute hell.
[00:29:25.172 --> 00:29:31.455]  We should pray for him, because whether he was guilty or not, which it looks like he's not, he doesn't deserve to be put in a gulag and just held for three or four months.
[00:29:31.475 --> 00:29:40.659]  They're now saying indefinitely, being tortured basically, being like two bologna sandwiches a day is the word, and in solitary confinement.
[00:29:41.879 --> 00:29:42.900]  So that's all coming up.
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:51.222]   And tying into the whole central bank digital currency, PNC Bank has debanked Donald Trump Jr.
[00:29:52.503 --> 00:29:53.643]  We know where this is all going.
[00:29:53.723 --> 00:29:58.445]  That is where it is going in Royal Triplicate.
[00:29:59.386 --> 00:30:03.087]  That's just some of the news today.
[00:30:04.808 --> 00:30:05.028]  U.S.
[00:30:05.048 --> 00:30:08.330]  develops AI-powered facial recognition tech for military robots.
[00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.711]  Hunter killers that scan your face and then kill you.
[00:30:11.291 --> 00:30:12.411]  I said that 25 years ago.
[00:30:12.431 --> 00:30:13.412]  You can find a video of it.
[00:30:14.893 --> 00:30:17.154]  Only NATO or nukes can save Ukraine.
[00:30:18.155 --> 00:30:20.076]  That's what Zelensky and his minions are saying.
[00:30:20.576 --> 00:30:22.057]  So they're saying, well, just give us the nukes.
[00:30:22.077 --> 00:30:22.857]  We'll use them on Russia.
[00:30:24.438 --> 00:30:25.839]  Man, it'll probably happen.
[00:30:27.479 --> 00:30:30.941]  Sitting in battle tanks, that'll cause World War III, Biden said eight months ago.
[00:30:31.882 --> 00:30:34.963]  Seven months later, oh, of course we're sitting in frontline battle tanks.
[00:30:36.844 --> 00:30:39.385]  Sleepwalking our way into thermal nuclear war.
[00:30:39.405 --> 00:30:42.027]  All right, here's what I'm going to do.
[00:30:42.087 --> 00:30:43.888]  I'm going to air an important John Bowne report.
[00:30:44.616 --> 00:30:48.177]  We're gonna come back in about four minutes and I'm gonna plow through all this news that I just mentioned.
[00:30:49.338 --> 00:31:01.401]  And then as soon as Roseanne Barr gets here, she's scheduled to be here in about 30 minutes, we'll air a couple promos and special reports, get her in the studio and cover the waterfront with her.
[00:31:01.962 --> 00:31:26.993]   But I want to play This John Bowne report, high treason as World Health Organization subjugates the USA, and that ties right into the global government power grab that whatever you see going on is created by corporate boards, the Carnegie Endowment, Rockefeller Endowment and others, transgenderism, all the stuff, central bank digital currencies, carbon taxes, and then they give them to the government officials, they put in power, and they implement it.
[00:31:28.866 --> 00:31:29.968]  And your U.S.
[00:31:30.028 --> 00:31:30.930]  ID will look like a U.S.
[00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:31.190]  ID.
[00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:32.934]  Your Australian ID will look like an Australian ID.
[00:31:32.954 --> 00:31:34.276]  Your German ID will look like a German ID.
[00:31:35.238 --> 00:31:37.321]  But it's all globally standardized by the U.N.
[00:31:38.305 --> 00:31:48.909]  We're going to be looking at the digital chains that are going on, the control grid and how it operates and the new developments of it publicly rolling out when we come back from this extremely important special report.
[00:31:48.949 --> 00:31:56.372]  Remember, you can find all these special reports at band.video and of course at conspiracyfact.info.
[00:31:57.052 --> 00:32:03.074]  They're now blocking the last URL we had, theinfowar.tv, which takes you to a full index of band.video.
[00:32:03.414 --> 00:32:04.695]  We have a new site.
[00:32:05.175 --> 00:32:07.396]  They'll probably ban that soon, but we'll have a new URL.
[00:32:07.836 --> 00:32:10.777]  And that is conspiracyfact.info.
[00:32:11.158 --> 00:32:14.199]  It now takes you to Band.Video with a full index of all the links.
[00:32:14.559 --> 00:32:24.543]  By going to Band.Video off the link conspiracyfact.info, it then gives you a full index of all the links in live time to the exact same videos.
[00:32:25.762 --> 00:32:32.869]  So you can send out a link that's not being blocked by places like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google, even a lot of your emails are blocking stuff.
[00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:35.931]  A lot of the text messages you'll notice, it's InfoWars.com.
[00:32:35.971 --> 00:32:39.655]  You can't send it through on Yahoo Messenger or even, you know, all these apps.
[00:32:40.255 --> 00:32:41.316]  So you got to get around that.
[00:32:41.356 --> 00:32:42.517]  Don't let the enemy win.
[00:32:42.738 --> 00:32:44.219]  They don't want the medicine getting out there.
[00:32:44.279 --> 00:32:48.363]  So you are the white blood cells that can get the medicine out to the rest of the bloodstream.
[00:32:48.743 --> 00:32:50.603]  And it's your decision whether you want to take this mission.
[00:32:50.863 --> 00:32:52.444]  ConspiracyFact.info.
[00:32:52.784 --> 00:32:54.804]  Then just click right there on whatever show's live.
[00:32:54.824 --> 00:32:57.464]  And right now it's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:57.484 --> 00:32:58.425]  And you can share that link.
[00:32:58.765 --> 00:32:59.385]  Find that link.
[00:32:59.425 --> 00:33:01.505]  It makes it simpler for people that have never been to the site.
[00:33:01.525 --> 00:33:04.126]  Just go there and again, scroll down a little bit.
[00:33:04.566 --> 00:33:06.506]  Or you can see right there on the left-hand side, the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:07.026 --> 00:33:07.646]  Click on that.
[00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:10.347]  And you can then send that out.
[00:33:10.607 --> 00:33:15.388]  And you can find all the other archived shows and all the live shows and so much more.
[00:33:15.888 --> 00:33:17.488]  So there it is.
[00:33:18.308 --> 00:33:25.915]  Ladies and gentlemen, get that all at conspiracyfact.info if you want to stand for the New World Order and win big time.
[00:33:26.336 --> 00:33:27.457]  All right, here's that special report.
[00:33:27.477 --> 00:33:32.181]  We'll come back, plow through the news, and then Roseanne Barr for her maiden visit with us.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:49.880]  I'm very excited.
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.202]  The eugenics is just getting started.
[00:33:52.362 --> 00:33:58.449]  The elites managed to eliminate a fraction of the populace they must destroy through the virus and vaccines.
[00:33:58.889 --> 00:34:01.570]  Surpassing the genocide of Nazi Germany.
[00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:07.072]  All over the Western world we are seeing very large measurable increases in unexplained deaths.
[00:34:07.092 --> 00:34:12.653]  The BBC in Great Britain for example just reported that quote excess deaths in 2022 are among the worst in 50 years.
[00:34:12.793 --> 00:34:13.854]  And does it damage the brain?
[00:34:13.874 --> 00:34:14.534]  You bet it does.
[00:34:14.694 --> 00:34:15.654]  Does it damage the heart?
[00:34:15.854 --> 00:34:16.095]  Yes.
[00:34:16.315 --> 00:34:16.715]  The liver?
[00:34:16.915 --> 00:34:17.195]  Yes.
[00:34:17.435 --> 00:34:18.035]  The bone marrow?
[00:34:18.115 --> 00:34:18.355]  Yes.
[00:34:19.276 --> 00:34:21.636]  It causes all sorts of harm in the human body.
[00:34:22.016 --> 00:34:25.199]   We should have stopped this Before it ever started.
[00:34:25.319 --> 00:34:26.861]  I'm seeing tremendous apathy.
[00:34:26.921 --> 00:34:30.426]  I'm seeing deaths, as you've mentioned, but no one seems to care.
[00:34:30.446 --> 00:34:33.510]  The family expresses no outrage.
[00:34:34.171 --> 00:34:37.435]  The obituaries don't mention the cause of death.
[00:34:37.555 --> 00:34:39.358]  It's just that, you know, a 24-year-old died.
[00:34:40.715 --> 00:34:41.175]  And that's it.
[00:34:41.236 --> 00:34:42.957]  The clinical trials were never ordered.
[00:34:45.218 --> 00:34:47.940]  The good manufacturing practice compliance was never ordered.
[00:34:48.761 --> 00:34:58.108]  And legally speaking, there were never even clinical trial subjects or investigators, because if you cannot have an investigational product, then there is no investigation.
[00:34:58.768 --> 00:35:05.673]  So FDA leadership and then global regulatory leadership, what they did, they impersonated the regulators.
[00:35:06.684 --> 00:35:09.986]  So that you fall for this lie and go get injected.
[00:35:10.106 --> 00:35:16.871]  Pfizer already, in court, stated that, please dismiss this case, Judge.
[00:35:17.672 --> 00:35:19.213]  We did not defraud the government.
[00:35:19.573 --> 00:35:22.295]  We delivered the fraud that the government ordered.
[00:35:22.695 --> 00:35:32.321]  However, their common goal is to reduce humans from nearly 8 billion people to a manageable slave populace of 500 million.
[00:35:32.502 --> 00:35:35.804]  We cannot hide away from human population growth.
[00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:39.857]  Because, you know, it underlies so many of the other problems.
[00:35:39.897 --> 00:35:46.711]  All these things we talk about wouldn't be a problem if there was the size of population that there was 500 years ago.
[00:35:48.109 --> 00:36:02.919]  And so, even though the pandemic has been largely exposed as a manufactured event, the elitists push forward, hedging their bets on more genocide as their silent kill strategy stumbles through its engineered propaganda.
[00:36:03.279 --> 00:36:08.022]  Countries will begin negotiations on a zero draft of the new pandemic accord.
[00:36:09.343 --> 00:36:15.047]  These discussions will be crucial for building a more effective health security architecture for the future.
[00:36:15.956 --> 00:36:22.701]  Grounded in international law, equity, and the fundamental right to health for all people.
[00:36:22.941 --> 00:36:34.368]   A public health emergency of international concern, or a FAKE, is defined by the IHR as an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states, It's a global treaty.
[00:36:34.188 --> 00:36:37.788]   to the international spread of disease and to potentially require
[00:36:37.788 --> 00:36:40.067]  a coordinated international response.
[00:36:40.067 --> 00:36:45.307]   This year in 2023, we may still be in a pandemic for quite some time because this virus
[00:36:45.307 --> 00:36:48.947]   is here with us to stay, which means we have to take measured action.
[00:36:48.947 --> 00:36:53.588]   We have to improve all of our system to be able to reduce the impact of COVID-19
[00:36:53.588 --> 00:36:54.588]  as we go forward.
[00:36:54.588 --> 00:36:56.347]  It's a global treaty.
[00:36:56.347 --> 00:37:03.088]   They want 127 nations to sign it and basically does hand over kind of our sovereignty.
[00:37:03.088 --> 00:37:07.227]   There's no other way to put it to what will be a kind of a global health police
[00:37:07.227 --> 00:37:12.148]   and giving all of the decision-making to the World Health Organization,
[00:37:12.148 --> 00:37:16.668]   which of course is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation disproportionately
[00:37:16.668 --> 00:37:19.387]  and their best friends, the Chinese Communist Party.
[00:37:19.387 --> 00:37:27.465]   The contract of the new draft ...is against the Constitution of America, against the laws and protection of human rights of America, etc., etc., etc.
[00:37:27.885 --> 00:37:42.429]  The law in America says whoever conspires to aim or work towards the goal to undermine the security, the dignity, or the integrity of the Constitution of the United States of America is committing high treason.
[00:37:42.929 --> 00:37:46.470]  Find out who from your government worked on that draft.
[00:37:47.475 --> 00:37:50.496]  And then go for high treason, then you have the army behind you.
[00:37:50.616 --> 00:37:54.638]  The World Health Organization pandemic treaty is deeply concerning.
[00:37:54.998 --> 00:37:59.960]  It seeks to give the discredited WHO huge powers over this country and our people.
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:07.023]  Powers to call pandemics, enforce lockdowns, enforce vaccinations, and decide when any pandemic is over.
[00:38:07.143 --> 00:38:14.866]  We know from the pandemic, and we know from other outbreaks such as Ebola, that these diseases know no borders.
[00:38:15.226 --> 00:38:26.009]  And it is only through international cooperation and collaboration together that we will arrive at the solutions to ensure we do not have a repeat of the last few years.
[00:38:26.229 --> 00:38:39.392]  How long before those who know someone who has died suddenly or those injured by the vaccines strike back once the war on humanity is completely 100% out in the open?
[00:38:39.532 --> 00:38:46.532]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:38:46.532 --> 00:38:50.279]   I treason as the WHO subjugates the U.S.A.
[00:38:50.979 --> 00:38:53.761]  and the world, but the enemy has been revealed.
[00:38:53.881 --> 00:38:54.822]  They're out in the open.
[00:38:55.343 --> 00:39:00.627]  Again, thank you for joining us on this live Saturday, March 4th, 2023 transmission.
[00:39:01.888 --> 00:39:03.789]  Roseanne Barr scheduled to be arriving any minute now.
[00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.671]  Be with us in the next hour.
[00:39:06.892 --> 00:39:08.333]  Now, I mentioned a lot of the news here.
[00:39:08.373 --> 00:39:10.575]  Let's start plowing through it after I make this key point.
[00:39:11.416 --> 00:39:12.757]  Yes, the Great Awakening is happening.
[00:39:12.837 --> 00:39:13.978]  It's the answer to the Great Reset.
[00:39:15.236 --> 00:39:18.299]  Yes, we see the numbers and the facts and anecdotal evidence everywhere.
[00:39:18.759 --> 00:39:20.481]  We have to keep pressing harder than ever.
[00:39:20.501 --> 00:39:29.148]  Because the enemy is going to pull out all the stops, try to scare us back into submission to complete their program.
[00:39:30.089 --> 00:39:36.114]  But we also have to talk about the solutions and the better world we want to build, not just oppose the world that the globalists are building.
[00:39:36.675 --> 00:39:40.919]  We'll talk about that with Roseanne Barr and more coming up.
[00:39:42.045 --> 00:39:55.291]  The UN, run by a bunch of big corporations and the Communist Chinese, funded by Bill Gates and others, have deployed, in the last three years, the World ID Standardization Database System.
[00:39:56.191 --> 00:40:09.266]   And the Australian government, the US government, the EU, more than a hundred governments are getting in line and are being given grant money, in some cases hundreds of millions per government, Like Italy, to then implement this.
[00:40:09.586 --> 00:40:12.428]  And you see it where, well, you can't have a job if you don't have this ID.
[00:40:12.989 --> 00:40:13.829]  We haven't had the shot.
[00:40:13.909 --> 00:40:19.434]  We have the head of the EU, video of her saying, you know, you've got to take shots or you can't have this ID.
[00:40:19.814 --> 00:40:28.982]  But it's really about making you have this ID and making you give them control over your body to them to have access to that ID.
[00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:31.135]  Digital ID, U.S.
[00:40:31.175 --> 00:40:39.801]  government poised for national rollout, the Federal Reserve announced, while Australia finds its North Star to harmonize standards, Global Government Forum.
[00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:42.643]  That's from the GlobalGovernmentForum.com.
[00:40:43.823 --> 00:40:48.406]  And they just had the Global Government Forum put on by the Davos Group three weeks ago announcing all this as well.
[00:40:49.687 --> 00:41:00.797]   London Mayor Sadiq Khan says far-right vaccine deniers, same folks that are being murdered by shots, Behind bid-to-block expansion of carbon tax green zones all over the country.
[00:41:01.157 --> 00:41:07.840]  So we always told you they're going to lock down parts of cities, have carbon taxes, make you have apps to even live in the area, lock everybody else out.
[00:41:08.721 --> 00:41:15.685]  They're admitting it now, but they're saying it's the people that didn't want to take the shots that they lied about that hurt so many and killed so many.
[00:41:16.125 --> 00:41:17.926]  We're the same ones fighting this.
[00:41:17.966 --> 00:41:19.347]  Yeah, it's called the awake people.
[00:41:20.587 --> 00:41:22.128]  Oh, the same ones that were right about the shots.
[00:41:22.188 --> 00:41:23.269]  Now they don't want you to have this.
[00:41:25.745 --> 00:41:26.706]  I want to play this clip.
[00:41:26.866 --> 00:41:31.329]  Chinese government propaganda warning citizens to maintain their social credit score.
[00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:47.322]  If you are on the blacklist, you can't purchase train, plane tickets, book hotel room, get a bank loan, and your face and ID number will display on a giant screen for everyone to shame you on the streets and in the business while you're there.
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:56.327]  And China openly shows the Communist Party, people trying to get a plane ticket with their young daughter, a husband and a wife, sorry, you can't fly.
[00:41:58.448 --> 00:42:00.890]  And they hand him a scan saying he's been banned from travel.
[00:42:01.391 --> 00:42:10.579]  The Chinese government said last year, you will not be able to travel one foot outside your home if you do not have the authorization by the system.
[00:42:11.667 --> 00:42:22.514]  We have the videos of people scrambling, holding up that they've got a green pass, and they should be able to travel, begging to just get on buses, because when the systems can immediately go down, nobody can travel.
[00:42:22.994 --> 00:42:27.437]  This is turning everything into a giant open-air prison.
[00:42:27.637 --> 00:42:32.436]   Now radio listeners obviously won't be able to see this, so I'll try to narrate some of it,
[00:42:32.436 --> 00:42:34.997]  but go ahead and roll the short minute clip with audio.
[00:42:34.997 --> 00:42:46.196]  By the way, hit pause and start it over.
[00:42:46.427 --> 00:42:58.894]  It starts, if you're a radio listener, we're on a lot of radio stations right now, with a mother and a father going to the airport, and they don't show the innocent child, so there's a bunny rabbit, a cartoon bunny rabbit is seen walking with the parents, but that's their child.
[00:42:59.815 --> 00:43:02.096]  Because the child's innocent, we're not going to show her face.
[00:43:02.556 --> 00:43:07.599]  It's obviously a little girl, shows her little girl's bag, being dragged behind the animated bunny rabbit.
[00:43:07.979 --> 00:43:09.140]  But she is being punished.
[00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:11.651]  And she's not allowed to go places.
[00:43:11.911 --> 00:43:13.913]  And that's the message, is we're holding your children hostage.
[00:43:14.193 --> 00:43:23.481]  And once you give in to what the CCP wants, or what Bill Gates wants, or what the New World Order wants, once you eat the bugs, once you drink the sewage water, once you owe nothing, have nothing, and like it, there'll always be more demands.
[00:43:24.342 --> 00:43:27.284]  What fool would ever want to be under the control of this?
[00:43:27.645 --> 00:43:30.067]  What idiot would submit to this?
[00:43:30.447 --> 00:43:32.769]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is terrorizing the public.
[00:43:33.249 --> 00:43:33.990]  And this has been done.
[00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:39.334]   We showed you years ago in China, people trying to get on trains, people trying to Go anywhere, try to buy groceries.
[00:43:39.354 --> 00:43:41.516]  You can't, because the government's mad at you.
[00:43:41.876 --> 00:43:43.417]  No judge, no jury, it just happens.
[00:43:44.058 --> 00:43:45.278]  Four corporations are mad at you.
[00:43:45.919 --> 00:43:48.060]  And in the West, it'll be run by the corporations, not the government.
[00:43:49.702 --> 00:43:50.762]  That's what de-platforming is.
[00:43:51.143 --> 00:43:51.963]  That's what all this is.
[00:43:52.484 --> 00:43:53.404]  Start it over, please.
[00:43:53.424 --> 00:43:59.128]  Sorry, you are an unauthorized passenger.
[00:43:59.148 --> 00:44:04.852]  You cannot board the plane.
[00:44:07.739 --> 00:44:11.221]  They put their hand up to you and say, sorry, you are not allowed to travel.
[00:44:14.182 --> 00:44:15.923]  Now the same guy tries to go do something else.
[00:44:16.984 --> 00:44:18.565]  He wants to book into a hotel.
[00:44:18.585 --> 00:44:19.745]  You can't have a hotel room.
[00:44:19.785 --> 00:44:20.245]  Hit pause again.
[00:44:23.227 --> 00:44:27.227]   Sorry, you are a private user and you are restricted to pay high bills in a hotel.
[00:44:27.227 --> 00:44:29.227]  You can't have a hotel room.
[00:44:29.227 --> 00:44:30.227]  Huh?
[00:44:30.227 --> 00:44:32.627]  Hit pause again.
[00:44:32.627 --> 00:44:37.267]   And under these new systems, whether it's Australia or China or Europe, now coming here,
[00:44:37.267 --> 00:44:42.746]   Canada, mom and pops have to implement all this as well and they could be penalizing
[00:44:42.746 --> 00:44:43.746]  things, see?
[00:44:43.801 --> 00:44:49.565]  So it's also about getting rid of the low-level infrastructure, only having big box store, big corporations.
[00:44:50.065 --> 00:44:51.345]  So continue.
[00:44:51.345 --> 00:44:58.784]  How's it gonna bank load?
[00:44:58.791 --> 00:44:59.791]  Sorry.
[00:44:59.791 --> 00:45:12.390]  Then he goes out on the street.
[00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:14.791]  They see his face up there.
[00:45:14.791 --> 00:45:16.791]  And they won't even talk to him.
[00:45:16.791 --> 00:45:26.791]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:45:18.854 --> 00:45:31.520]   Now under the Cultural Revolution, and Mao Zedong's great leap forward, They would just have the young people go stone you or beat you up or burn down your house because they handed out flyers saying you were the bad guy.
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:33.080]  No need for the state to do it.
[00:45:33.621 --> 00:45:34.921]  And then they would get brownie points for doing it.
[00:45:34.961 --> 00:45:45.344]  Now, it's just digital everywhere, like you saw in Minority Report 20 years ago with Tom Cruise, where once he's on the run, suddenly all the jumbotrons and all the high tech.
[00:45:46.224 --> 00:45:50.726]  Well, California is going to come out with digital license plates, they're saying, that also flash images.
[00:45:51.792 --> 00:45:53.214]  Of who's in trouble and who's bad.
[00:45:53.334 --> 00:45:56.797]  I mean, this is the holy grail of their control.
[00:45:57.118 --> 00:45:58.499]  And here's an example here in the United States.
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:04.365]   PNC Bank abruptly cuts off Donald Trump Jr.' 's news site, MXM News.
[00:46:05.506 --> 00:46:12.254]  It's being reported, saying we are not going to support your political activities, so you are banned from having a bank account with us.
[00:46:13.666 --> 00:46:14.226]  Here's another one.
[00:46:14.246 --> 00:46:15.327]  It's only a two-and-a-half-minute report.
[00:46:15.347 --> 00:46:17.588]  And remember, this is Sky News.
[00:46:17.948 --> 00:46:22.627]   initiatives will bring a new dark age upon us. Daniel Wild and Alan Jones out
[00:46:22.627 --> 00:46:27.748]   of Australia. And remember, this is Sky News, everything happening there is the
[00:46:27.748 --> 00:46:34.987]   exact same program against us. So it's the same people say, "Why do you care about
[00:46:35.471 --> 00:46:38.393]  There's this built-in, why do we care about what's happening in North Korea?
[00:46:38.433 --> 00:46:39.474]  Why do we care about what's happening in China?
[00:46:39.494 --> 00:46:40.915]  Why do we care about what's happening in Mexico?
[00:46:41.255 --> 00:46:47.018]  Because the new world order is trying their initiatives everywhere, and like dominoes, when one country falls, it falls on us.
[00:46:47.319 --> 00:46:49.060]  Plus, these are fellow humans we've got to fight for.
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:51.301]  Here's a blast from the past.
[00:46:51.421 --> 00:46:53.943]  EU should consider mandatory vaccination.
[00:46:54.983 --> 00:46:57.285]  Ursula van der Linde, head of the EU.
[00:46:58.715 --> 00:47:06.146]  Here's another one with her saying we're going to censor you and ban anybody and arrest anybody that disagrees with the shots or says they don't work.
[00:47:06.166 --> 00:47:08.149]  I mean, they're just lying, psychotic criminals.
[00:47:09.212 --> 00:47:12.454]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:47:12.474 --> 00:47:20.698]  And then we've got Kevin O'Leary dumps on Newsom's California and says it's unlivable and no business will be able to operate there soon.
[00:47:21.139 --> 00:47:22.219]  That's the plan.
[00:47:22.419 --> 00:47:24.821]  Only the megacorporations will be able to operate.
[00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:26.521]  But first they've got to collapse everything.
[00:47:27.242 --> 00:47:29.463]  So let's play those clips back to back.
[00:47:29.523 --> 00:47:32.685]  Let's play Alan Jones in Australia.
[00:47:33.225 --> 00:47:35.726]  And then let's play the Kevin O'Leary clip on CNN.
[00:47:38.669 --> 00:47:42.935]  Because this just illustrates what the plan is, a post-industrial world.
[00:47:43.335 --> 00:47:45.819]  It's warfare, but not with tanks and planes.
[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:47.561]  That's only if they need them.
[00:47:47.661 --> 00:47:49.263]  It's economic, it's cultural.
[00:47:49.744 --> 00:47:50.344]  Here are the clips.
[00:47:51.269 --> 00:47:51.389]  I know.
[00:47:51.469 --> 00:47:55.091]  I mean, I have said for years this is a national economic suicide note.
[00:47:55.131 --> 00:47:57.332]  Well, the economy is about to commit suicide.
[00:47:57.632 --> 00:48:01.394]  I mean, unless someone changes direction, Daniel, we are facing the dark ages.
[00:48:01.694 --> 00:48:04.055]  I mean, these net zero goals are ludicrous.
[00:48:04.736 --> 00:48:20.504]  As the Spectator magazine editorialised, Daniel, this week, and I quote this, this stupidity has manifested itself in perfectly good coal-fired power stations literally being blown to smithereens to the applause of fools and shysters.
[00:48:21.204 --> 00:48:33.969]  It says, the last decade has seen our energy infrastructure dismantled at breathtaking speed, accompanied by a blizzard of false promises about new technologies and to the tune of ever-soaring household bills.
[00:48:34.429 --> 00:48:34.809]  Unquote.
[00:48:35.049 --> 00:48:39.551]  Daniel, there was a time when the Coalition held out against this madness.
[00:48:39.831 --> 00:48:41.252]  Tony Abbott once called it crap.
[00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:51.481]  But you've said the top ten, your research, New South Wales Legislative Assembly seats with the most jobs at risk are in rural or regional areas.
[00:48:54.143 --> 00:48:55.204]  That's exactly right.
[00:48:55.384 --> 00:49:02.235]   It's those in the regions that don't have a voice because both sides of politics Backed in these destructive policies.
[00:49:02.936 --> 00:49:05.739]  In 2013, you referred to Tony Abbott.
[00:49:05.759 --> 00:49:15.250]  Well, he won that election in a landslide against all of the predictions of the elite media people and the aficionados on his promise to axe the carbon tax.
[00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:29.126]   And he brought with him a great majority of the Australian people who knew It was all environmental, all economic pain for no environmental gain, yet we continue to pursue these policies.
[00:49:29.466 --> 00:49:30.507]  Prices have already gone up.
[00:49:30.547 --> 00:49:33.628]  You look at the energy bills of households and small businesses.
[00:49:33.848 --> 00:49:35.629]  They've gone up by thousands of dollars.
[00:49:35.649 --> 00:49:51.773]   The government itself in the budget has acknowledged it's going to go up by 50% at least over the next two years, yet under the policy of net zero, at least six more, six more large coal-fired power stations are going to close down.
[00:49:51.973 --> 00:49:54.896]  This is going to get a lot worse before it gets better, Alan.
[00:49:54.916 --> 00:49:57.337]  Well, just let's amplify this and be specific.
[00:49:57.377 --> 00:50:07.385]  Now, what the research of the IPA has said, Daniel's research, 63,765 jobs to go in agriculture.
[00:50:07.425 --> 00:50:09.006]  Let's just take that point quickly, Daniel.
[00:50:11.883 --> 00:50:18.946]  Well, Alan, we last week toured through some of these areas, Tamworth, Narrabri, Gunnedah, Armidale, Muzzlebrook.
[00:50:19.326 --> 00:50:22.687]  These are the communities that are going to feel it.
[00:50:23.127 --> 00:50:29.429]  And when those jobs go, it's not just the direct jobs, it's all of the other jobs that rely on that primary production.
[00:50:29.709 --> 00:50:39.473]  If you walk down the main streets of these towns, cafes, hospitality, chemists, pharmacies, they all rely on the income that's generated from farming or from mining.
[00:50:40.769 --> 00:50:47.934]  Just in terms of your point about farming, we've already had the Federal Government say they want to impose a methane tax, which is a tax on cattle.
[00:50:48.294 --> 00:50:51.616]  Not only is that critical for our own food supply, we export it.
[00:50:51.856 --> 00:50:54.998]  Because we have such high quality produce here, we export it.
[00:50:55.298 --> 00:50:58.600]  It provides nutrition around the world and it earns export revenue.
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:50:59.761]  Where does that revenue go?
[00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:03.813]  When you go, it goes into schools, roads and hospitals and more affordably.
[00:51:03.833 --> 00:51:05.154]  That benefits the entire community.
[00:51:05.574 --> 00:51:11.018]  But this clipboard class with triplicate forms, they don't get how wealth's created and how it's spread around the community.
[00:51:11.458 --> 00:51:13.039]  It's the state where I grew my kids.
[00:51:13.099 --> 00:51:15.501]  I mean, our family grew up in Boston, Massachusetts.
[00:51:15.921 --> 00:51:22.426]  We left there to move to Florida, like everybody else is, because it's such a tough place to... You know, this is a tough message.
[00:51:22.486 --> 00:51:25.769]  People really are critical about this, but somebody has to call it out.
[00:51:26.249 --> 00:51:30.790]  Because this is a competition of states now, and we don't put money there anymore.
[00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:33.591]  We put it in other places, and jobs are created elsewhere.
[00:51:33.971 --> 00:51:40.933]  Over time, this is going to diminish New Jersey, diminish New York, diminish Massachusetts, and California, out of business.
[00:51:41.233 --> 00:51:41.773]  Out of business.
[00:51:42.053 --> 00:51:42.654]  El Morte.
[00:51:42.914 --> 00:51:43.574]  No business there.
[00:51:43.974 --> 00:51:44.854]  You can't do business there.
[00:51:45.474 --> 00:51:46.975]  I don't know what that place is going to turn into.
[00:51:47.015 --> 00:51:47.935]  Maybe a tourist zone.
[00:51:48.395 --> 00:51:49.055]  But no business.
[00:51:49.355 --> 00:51:50.596]  Imagine San Francisco.
[00:51:50.736 --> 00:51:52.616]  You can't even walk at night out in the street.
[00:51:54.037 --> 00:51:54.357]  Sorry.
[00:51:56.681 --> 00:52:02.365]  Today I want to take the opportunity to talk about an important piece of legislation that may or may not yet be on your radar.
[00:52:03.106 --> 00:52:12.673]  Last week I introduced the Central Bank Digital Currency Anti-Surveillance State Act to halt the efforts of unelected bureaucrats here in Washington, D.C.
[00:52:13.073 --> 00:52:16.536]  from stripping Americans of their right to financial privacy.
[00:52:17.625 --> 00:52:28.762]  Digital assets and the digital economy are the future, but the Federal Reserve should play no role in developing a central bank digital currency, or otherwise known as a CBDC.
[00:52:29.342 --> 00:52:32.527]  The consequences, if we get it wrong, are far too serious.
[00:52:33.228 --> 00:52:43.134]  The Biden administration is currently itching to create a digital, authoritarian-style, surveillance-style digital dollar.
[00:52:43.875 --> 00:52:51.380]  And through an executive order, they are pursuing analysis on a retail CBDC that would not be open, permissionless, or private.
[00:52:53.661 --> 00:53:02.167]  In fact, it would be ridden with significant risk to Americans' privacy, security, financial inclusion, and a whole lot more.
[00:53:02.687 --> 00:53:11.653]  This kind of digital currency would give the federal government access to and control over literally every financial transaction conducted by Americans.
[00:53:12.293 --> 00:53:17.576]  That's why I, along with a number of my colleagues, introduced the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act.
[00:53:18.017 --> 00:53:22.820]  It's going to prohibit the Fed from issuing a CBDC directly to anyone.
[00:53:23.815 --> 00:53:29.564]  It's going to bar the Fed from using the CBDC to implement monetary policy and control our economy.
[00:53:30.165 --> 00:53:38.297]  And it's going to require the Fed's CBDC projects to be transparent if they get to go forward, to be transparent to Congress and the American people.
[00:53:38.357 --> 00:53:50.590]   We need These common sense guardrails to prevent unelected bureaucrats here in Washington from sacrificing Americans' right to financial privacy is, I think Mike Gallagher's committee is going to show us tonight.
[00:53:51.051 --> 00:53:54.434]  We do not want to emulate the CCP.
[00:53:54.514 --> 00:54:00.320]  We should not be taking our direction from the Communist Party of China.
[00:54:01.141 --> 00:54:02.963]  Developing a digital version of the U.S.
[00:54:03.003 --> 00:54:14.316]  dollar that makes transactions more efficient, extends financial inclusion, and does not compromise American sovereignty or privacy will send us into the next several generations of the digital economy.
[00:54:14.156 --> 00:54:35.515]  We can't afford to get this wrong.
[00:54:36.269 --> 00:54:37.370]  The holy grail of control.
[00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:49.639]  If you think the no-fly list that I told you 20 years ago would be used on patriots, which they now admit it is used against millions of innocent people, remember the IRS got legislation introduced eight years ago under Obama, and it didn't pass.
[00:54:50.552 --> 00:54:56.794]  That if you were behind on your taxes, no judge, no jury, hadn't been found, they just said it, you couldn't fly on an airplane.
[00:54:59.255 --> 00:55:00.836]  You couldn't be on an Amtrak.
[00:55:01.876 --> 00:55:04.877]  They said later you won't be able to pay for a hotel.
[00:55:05.457 --> 00:55:09.399]  Everything the Chai-coms have done has been designed here in America.
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:14.601]  It's not the American government, it's the criminal globalist corporations.
[00:55:15.581 --> 00:55:21.020]   And now, the government of the Netherlands Holland.
[00:55:22.041 --> 00:55:23.763]  It's the third biggest food producer in the world.
[00:55:23.803 --> 00:55:25.104]  They have the best farmers in the world.
[00:55:25.164 --> 00:55:25.965]  Nobody can deny it.
[00:55:27.106 --> 00:55:28.767]  The Dutch have a green thumb.
[00:55:29.548 --> 00:55:31.269]  They got green hands.
[00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:37.655]  And they've announced that up to a third of their farms are being forcibly taken.
[00:55:38.976 --> 00:55:39.476]  Right now.
[00:55:39.916 --> 00:55:46.077]  And the government doubled down and they made the minister that did it all, the head of the UN program, to quote, stop the carbon of farming.
[00:55:46.257 --> 00:55:50.098]  And they say, farming, growing plants, cows, pigs, everything's bad.
[00:55:50.358 --> 00:55:50.998]  Life is bad.
[00:55:51.198 --> 00:55:54.939]  I told you, carbon dioxide coming out of a full power plant, they say is poison.
[00:55:55.219 --> 00:55:57.219]  But what do you think, what do you think we exhale, boys and girls?
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:00.160]  It's outrageous.
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:05.801]  And what was the problem with the clip out of Australia, and the clip out of California, and the clip from Congress?
[00:56:07.128 --> 00:56:09.389]  They say it's wrong what the globalists are doing.
[00:56:09.989 --> 00:56:11.310]  They say it'll destroy things.
[00:56:12.911 --> 00:56:18.433]  And they say the left and the social engineers don't know what they're doing.
[00:56:19.134 --> 00:56:22.095]  What, when they give you a poison shot that erases your immune system, gives you blood clots?
[00:56:22.495 --> 00:56:24.736]  When it was in the studies, when they did it in rats years before?
[00:56:26.157 --> 00:56:27.237]  They don't know what they're doing.
[00:56:27.257 --> 00:56:36.210]   I mean, if I walk up to you with a 12-gauge shotgun and put it up to your face and blow your head off, And I go, oh, I didn't know it would do that.
[00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:39.071]  I'm still going to prison, folks, because I knew damn well what it would do.
[00:56:41.152 --> 00:56:46.275]  Your neighbor comes over with a meat cleaver and chops your wife's hand off.
[00:56:46.815 --> 00:56:48.696]  She opens the door and he just hacks her hand off.
[00:56:49.417 --> 00:56:50.977]  Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know what I was doing.
[00:56:51.258 --> 00:56:55.139]  We sit here and keep pretending like this isn't by design.
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:56.800]  Every damn bit of this.
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:57.641]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:56:58.781 --> 00:56:59.922]  I covered the numbers a month ago.
[00:57:01.499 --> 00:57:07.844]  When Biden first got in, he directed the IRS and the small portion of agents going after millionaires and billionaires.
[00:57:07.924 --> 00:57:10.766]  Whether you believe the IRS, income taxes, obviously it's a fraud.
[00:57:10.786 --> 00:57:13.928]  1913, 16th Amendment, we know that.
[00:57:13.948 --> 00:57:15.649]  17th Amendment, all that stuff.
[00:57:15.669 --> 00:57:16.750]  Same year the Federal Reserve came in.
[00:57:21.734 --> 00:57:22.754]  I'm not debating the income tax.
[00:57:22.814 --> 00:57:25.136]  I'm saying if you're going to have it, you should go after the producers.
[00:57:27.418 --> 00:57:27.538]  No.
[00:57:28.649 --> 00:57:37.451]  He hired then last year 87,000 more IRS agents to target $41,000 or less a year when they don't even bring in 6% of the revenue.
[00:57:37.851 --> 00:57:44.433]  Why would you have the majority, 95% of your agents, go after the poor working public?
[00:57:45.353 --> 00:57:46.254]  The blue collar people?
[00:57:48.194 --> 00:57:49.955]  Because you want to drive them into submission.
[00:57:49.975 --> 00:57:50.675]  You want to make them give up.
[00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:55.231]  That's war on the people.
[00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:57.852]  There's a checklist of what you do to destroy society.
[00:57:58.112 --> 00:57:59.173]  Attack the nuclear family.
[00:57:59.453 --> 00:58:00.153]  Attack men.
[00:58:01.574 --> 00:58:02.635]  Sexualize children.
[00:58:03.775 --> 00:58:07.537]  They are going down a checklist in this entire plan.
[00:58:07.577 --> 00:58:08.698]  Yeah, here's the IRS.
[00:58:09.918 --> 00:58:19.583]  They have one-day training seminars and then sign these people up to be armed agents and they practice going and arresting people at their houses.
[00:58:21.344 --> 00:58:22.024]  It's just insane.
[00:58:24.107 --> 00:58:26.588]  Remember it came out the IRS has billions of bullets?
[00:58:27.048 --> 00:58:27.708]  What is this?
[00:58:30.249 --> 00:58:32.009]  Google pays zero tax.
[00:58:33.209 --> 00:58:34.610]  Bill Gates pays zero tax.
[00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:36.230]  He puts his money in a tax-free foundation.
[00:58:37.191 --> 00:58:40.491]  Elon Musk got targeted and bitched at, so he's paying us like 3% tax.
[00:58:41.852 --> 00:58:51.794]  The ultra-rich have written the laws where they don't pay taxes, but they write the laws that you do, not because they even need the money.
[00:58:51.814 --> 00:58:53.515]  The government just issues the currency and credit.
[00:58:55.076 --> 00:59:01.076]   But because they don't want you to do well, they want you poor under their control.
[00:59:01.076 --> 00:59:13.396]  And they are literally hiring IQ, low IQ morons.
[00:59:13.644 --> 00:59:17.685]  By the way, the footage finally came out and I'm sending it to the crew on Thursday.
[00:59:17.705 --> 00:59:19.746]  See if you can pull it up in my messages.
[00:59:20.846 --> 00:59:21.947]  I forgot to get on today's list.
[00:59:23.376 --> 00:59:26.757]  Remember the public schools around the country, federally funded with Black Lives Matter?
[00:59:27.498 --> 00:59:54.305]   Michigan, California, New York, came out two weeks ago that during Black History Month, they marched the white pupils in middle school Out to the parking lot, and then the black students, led by black teachers and leftists, scream at them and tell them they're bad in basically an open-air re-education camp.
[00:59:57.326 --> 01:00:03.128]  And then order them to sign up for extracurricular Black Lives Matter training after school hours.
[01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:07.190]  Yeah, they found the footage.
[01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:07.650]  Just some of it.
[01:00:11.454 --> 01:00:14.297]  And they induct them into a cult that's really just communist.
[01:00:15.137 --> 01:00:16.519]  You're not against black people, are you?
[01:00:16.539 --> 01:00:19.702]  Well then, you're in our communist cult to prove you're not bad.
[01:00:21.183 --> 01:00:22.904]  They're just using black people, folks.
[01:00:22.944 --> 01:00:26.227]  It's not black people that are running this or controlling this.
[01:00:26.247 --> 01:00:28.790]  This is total social engineering.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.281]  Let's listen to this moron.
[01:00:31.301 --> 01:00:32.182]  You can see the full interview.
[01:00:32.202 --> 01:00:33.303]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:00:33.944 --> 01:00:36.606]  It's on Dr. Simon Goddick's site on Twitter.
[01:00:37.187 --> 01:00:38.748]  I no longer wish to be part of this world.
[01:00:39.048 --> 01:00:40.670]  Here's a young man here in the U.S.
[01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:49.838]  saying that farming is the worst carbon producer, and since everything carbon is bad, you know, carbon-based life forms, we've got to ban all the farms.
[01:00:49.978 --> 01:00:52.741]  Where does this idiot think he gets the damn food?
[01:00:53.061 --> 01:00:55.403]  But that's the mindlessness of these people.
[01:00:55.423 --> 01:00:55.744]  Here it is.
[01:00:56.747 --> 01:00:57.769]  Farming needs to stop.
[01:00:57.989 --> 01:01:00.152]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[01:01:02.073 --> 01:01:03.073]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:03.513]  Farming needs to stop.
[01:01:03.533 --> 01:01:04.694]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[01:01:04.714 --> 01:01:05.374]  Farming needs to stop.
[01:01:05.594 --> 01:01:07.434]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[01:01:07.454 --> 01:01:07.955]  Farming needs to stop.
[01:01:07.975 --> 01:01:09.015]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[01:01:09.035 --> 01:01:09.495]  Farming needs to stop.
[01:01:09.515 --> 01:01:11.235]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[01:01:11.255 --> 01:01:11.796]  Farming needs to stop.
[01:01:11.816 --> 01:01:12.836]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[01:01:12.856 --> 01:01:13.296]  Farming needs to stop.
[01:01:13.316 --> 01:01:15.056]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[01:01:15.076 --> 01:01:15.597]  Farming needs to stop.
[01:01:15.617 --> 01:01:16.757]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[01:01:16.777 --> 01:01:17.257]  Farming needs to stop.
[01:01:17.277 --> 01:01:18.317]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[01:01:18.337 --> 01:01:18.797]  Farming needs to stop.
[01:01:18.817 --> 01:01:20.118]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[01:01:20.138 --> 01:01:20.638]  Farming needs to stop.
[01:01:20.658 --> 01:01:21.798]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[01:01:21.838 --> 01:01:22.478]  Farming needs to stop.
[01:01:22.498 --> 01:01:23.679]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[01:01:23.699 --> 01:01:24.439]  Farming needs to stop.
[01:01:24.459 --> 01:01:25.979]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[01:01:26.019 --> 01:01:26.619]  Farming needs to stop.
[01:01:26.639 --> 01:01:28.160]  That's the single biggest driver of climate change.
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:28.660]  Farming needs to stop.
[01:01:30.819 --> 01:01:32.660]  It's like space aliens took over or something.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:41.185]  Everything that's biological, everything that works, everything that's good, everything that's designed for us, by God, is being taken away in front of us.
[01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:51.170]  And whether you're in England, or the UK, or the Netherlands, or Germany, or Italy, or Australia, or New Zealand, everywhere, they are bringing out the new carbon taxes.
[01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:52.631]  Did you notice what happened a couple days ago?
[01:01:52.651 --> 01:01:54.192]  An update on your iPhones.
[01:01:54.392 --> 01:01:57.314]  And Apple's always ahead of it, so it'll be on Droid by next week, I predict.
[01:02:00.014 --> 01:02:01.275]  What happened, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:02:04.137 --> 01:02:06.880]  Well, well, welly, well, well.
[01:02:08.761 --> 01:02:09.281]  What happened?
[01:02:10.622 --> 01:02:14.986]  New iPhone charging feature turns itself on by default.
[01:02:15.466 --> 01:02:17.648]  What is it and how to disable it?
[01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:18.409]  For now.
[01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:24.373]  And the new iPhones have a carbon tax system on them.
[01:02:25.154 --> 01:02:27.076]  Clean energy charging on iPhone.
[01:02:27.116 --> 01:02:28.537]  What it means and how to turn it off.
[01:02:30.009 --> 01:02:30.430]  For now.
[01:02:31.813 --> 01:02:34.138]  Just like we have all the smart meters and the rest of it.
[01:02:34.158 --> 01:02:37.444]  In fact, I have a clip here of the smart meters.
[01:02:39.315 --> 01:02:47.498]  And how, oh, Australian, which is the beta test, their prices have exploded so bad, they've tripled the last five years under carbon regulations.
[01:02:47.898 --> 01:02:53.560]  But don't worry though, now the new smart thermostat, which all the new ones have been for a decade, it'll now control your house.
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:57.421]  Remember how big it was last year when people in Denver, thousands of them videotaped and put it online?
[01:02:57.821 --> 01:03:01.783]  It said, oh, for the carbon, for the earth, we're going to set your thermostat to 78.
[01:03:02.943 --> 01:03:04.664]  You can't set it below 78 to save the earth.
[01:03:06.104 --> 01:03:17.106]  It's all AI in your house, making you a prisoner, and all over the world, under this, they're banning space heaters, gas heaters, and fireplaces, and they're trying to ban gas stoves.
[01:03:17.387 --> 01:03:22.288]  And they went, well, yeah, it's a conspiracy theory to not like we're going to ban your gas stove, but yeah, it's a proposal.
[01:03:23.348 --> 01:03:25.528]  In the U.S., already been done in Europe.
[01:03:26.028 --> 01:03:26.408]  Look it up.
[01:03:27.929 --> 01:03:29.309]  Germany banned 10 years ago.
[01:03:30.068 --> 01:03:35.407]   by the year 2023, all new construction of single family homes.
[01:03:35.407 --> 01:03:39.427]  By law, you cannot build a new single family home.
[01:03:39.427 --> 01:03:45.907]   You can't live alone in your house, in the city or in the woods or on a farm or in a field.
[01:03:45.907 --> 01:03:47.528]  You can't go have that privacy.
[01:03:47.528 --> 01:03:53.628]   Every freedom, every decent thing, everything that people aspire to has to be destroyed
[01:03:53.628 --> 01:03:57.788]   'cause they're gonna make the whole planet poor so you can't have the general public doing well.
[01:03:57.346 --> 01:04:03.250]  Only a bunch of arrogant globalists flying the Bilderberg group on their private jets with their five, six kids and their four or five mistresses.
[01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:06.572]  Oh, they can have the biggest carbon footprint you ever wanted to see.
[01:04:07.827 --> 01:04:10.008]  Because they own the carbon footprint companies.
[01:04:10.548 --> 01:04:18.170]  And people like Al Gore, his company's already made several billion dollars off of idiots that opted in to carbon taxes at the airlines.
[01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:19.791]  Everywhere it says, here's your carbon footprint.
[01:04:19.951 --> 01:04:24.492]  Would you like to opt in and pay money to show that you're a bad person and to make it okay?
[01:04:24.732 --> 01:04:28.893]  As like an indulgence, like the Catholic Church would do 600, 700 years ago.
[01:04:29.213 --> 01:04:34.597]   They'd say, hey, your mother Is probably in purgatory because she did something wrong.
[01:04:34.858 --> 01:04:43.462]  But if you pay the church this many gold pieces, we will intercede to God and we will get your mother or father out of purgatory into heaven.
[01:04:44.182 --> 01:04:44.882]  What's the new thing?
[01:04:44.702 --> 01:04:49.501]   "Oh, well if you'll just pay some carbon taxes and put a bumper sticker on your car explaining you did it,
[01:04:49.501 --> 01:04:53.742]   and do all this with this app, we will absolve you of how you're bad."
[01:04:53.742 --> 01:05:00.141]  And then they pull crap like this.
[01:05:00.416 --> 01:05:01.017]  Look at this photo.
[01:05:01.057 --> 01:05:03.659]  It's all over Europe, all over the UK, and now in the US.
[01:05:04.219 --> 01:05:08.463]  They showed temperatures years ago, higher than they are now, but it was all green.
[01:05:09.784 --> 01:05:12.146]  Because the image from space would be a green background.
[01:05:12.526 --> 01:05:14.108]  When it shows the Sahara, it's a brown background.
[01:05:14.848 --> 01:05:19.072]  But now, a couple years later, everything's in red, even though the temperatures are lower.
[01:05:19.412 --> 01:05:21.574]  They want you to believe everything is hell.
[01:05:22.254 --> 01:05:23.315]  Everything is horrible.
[01:05:23.796 --> 01:05:25.457]  Oh my God, it's everywhere.
[01:05:25.577 --> 01:05:27.439]  It's total propaganda.
[01:05:29.571 --> 01:05:39.899]  The WHO, the IMF, and the World Bank will all work in conjunction with BlackRock and Vanguard to force one world corporate run government on an increasingly free people.
[01:05:39.939 --> 01:05:43.022]  Go watch that video as they all announce they're coordinating bringing this in.
[01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:44.835]  Good news!
[01:05:45.195 --> 01:05:45.976]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:05:46.036 --> 01:05:47.116]  will make a great president.
[01:05:47.376 --> 01:05:51.298]  Thinking about launching a Democratic challenge to Biden 2024 White House nomination.
[01:05:51.718 --> 01:05:53.519]  I would vote for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:05:53.579 --> 01:05:54.259]  as a Democrat.
[01:05:54.879 --> 01:05:57.040]  Instantly an amazing man of total courage.
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:57.821]  We love him.
[01:05:58.661 --> 01:06:01.162]  I will vote Democrat if he's the nominee.
[01:06:03.442 --> 01:06:04.123]  Absolutely.
[01:06:04.523 --> 01:06:06.105]  I'll vote for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:06:06.145 --> 01:06:08.488]  over DeSantis or over Trump any day.
[01:06:08.608 --> 01:06:12.092]  I will vote Democrat right now for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:06:12.173 --> 01:06:17.173]  That guy is 110% real all the way.
[01:06:17.173 --> 01:06:25.173]  I just knocked over this whole glass of ice water.
[01:06:25.135 --> 01:06:27.717]  So, not so excited about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:06:27.737 --> 01:06:29.998]  So when we go to break, here are a couple extra promos.
[01:06:30.018 --> 01:06:35.321]  We get Roseanne Barr in here, get this going and get the cleanup going here with this whole glass of ice water.
[01:06:35.361 --> 01:06:37.542]  I just knocked all the way over there where she's going to be at.
[01:06:37.562 --> 01:06:39.623]  All right.
[01:06:40.584 --> 01:06:43.826]  Incredible times, ladies and gentlemen, but humanity is waking up.
[01:06:44.586 --> 01:06:45.467]  So much excitement.
[01:06:46.167 --> 01:06:51.250]  I am so excited to have Roseanne Barr in studio with us to cover all these issues.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:52.580]  And more.
[01:06:53.381 --> 01:06:56.203]  We already aired a piece of her amazing comedy that she's been doing lately.
[01:06:56.223 --> 01:07:01.086]  A lot of courage earlier, but the last clip we'll play before she comes in is gonna be that clip.
[01:07:01.586 --> 01:07:03.748]  We're gonna air a few special reports, a few promos here.
[01:07:04.228 --> 01:07:06.930]  We're gonna get her in here and we're gonna come back and cover it all.
[01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:12.974]  And remember, this is not a spectator sport here in the InfoWarp.
[01:07:16.596 --> 01:07:20.719]  We have millions of viewers and listeners.
[01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:24.599]  This show will get millions of views.
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:33.323]  But whether you're watching it live or watching it taped later, at Band.Video or ConspiracyFact.Info, take clips out.
[01:07:33.503 --> 01:07:34.243]  Share it everywhere.
[01:07:35.023 --> 01:07:35.884]  Put the whole thing up.
[01:07:36.264 --> 01:07:36.704]  Promote it.
[01:07:36.744 --> 01:07:41.226]  Because they do everything they can to keep people like Roseanne Barr and others from being heard.
[01:07:41.586 --> 01:07:42.706]  So we're going to air this first.
[01:07:43.386 --> 01:07:50.049]  Clip 5 and Clip 6 is Joe Rogan and Russell Brand saying nice things about the broadcast and how I was right.
[01:07:50.289 --> 01:07:52.210]  And it's just interesting to show that they're really waking up.
[01:07:53.052 --> 01:07:54.935]  And Russell Brand has been wearing InfoWars shirts on air.
[01:07:54.975 --> 01:07:55.636]  We really like that.
[01:07:55.656 --> 01:07:57.319]  I want to get Russell back on the show soon.
[01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:58.480]  He's been on a few times before.
[01:07:59.362 --> 01:08:02.767]  And then we'll get into all the other clips that the guys and gals in there have ready.
[01:08:03.869 --> 01:08:07.895]  I'm going to go finally meet Roseanne in person, but first I've got to clean this mess up, so let's get that done.
[01:08:08.906 --> 01:08:12.249]  And then we are going to get her in here and cover it all today.
[01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:17.173]  We'll go at least an hour live, uncensored, unfiltered with her in studio.
[01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:18.314]  If she wants to take a break, she can.
[01:08:18.334 --> 01:08:19.475]  If she wants to go two hours, we will.
[01:08:19.495 --> 01:08:20.756]  If she wants to go an hour, we will.
[01:08:21.277 --> 01:08:24.620]  Whatever she wants to do, because this is live, unfiltered, uncensored.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.982]  Everybody you know, right now, to share the link.
[01:08:27.962 --> 01:08:31.962]   from info wars.com forward slash show band up video conspiracy fact
[01:08:31.962 --> 01:08:36.282]   dot info or just tell folks hey roseanne bar's live right now with alex jones
[01:08:36.282 --> 01:08:39.962]   and tell people you know how to find the forbidden site that's what causes
[01:08:39.962 --> 01:08:44.122]   the chain reaction special saturday broadcast alex jones host roseanne bar
[01:08:44.122 --> 01:08:50.362]   live in studio to discuss the great awakening and more
[01:08:50.362 --> 01:08:56.122]   so again ladies and gentlemen we'll go to break and we'll be right back
[01:08:56.681 --> 01:09:04.681]   so last year we published a report entitled evidence
[01:09:04.681 --> 01:09:11.641]   that u.s government targeted red states with deadly batch of vaccine
[01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:12.292]  A story that most outlets ignored.
[01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:19.637]  Private leaked documents from the CDC show a list of expiry dates and only certain lots are included.
[01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:24.440]  The very same lots found to be highly toxic in part of Cooper's database.
[01:09:25.362 --> 01:09:33.985]  This mode of deployment allows governments the ability to direct deadly batches into specific populations, such as red states.
[01:09:34.946 --> 01:09:44.490]  Analysis of the number of dying per 100,000 vaccinated in 50 states shows us that the overwhelming majority of vaccine deaths are happening in red states.
[01:09:45.570 --> 01:10:00.485]  Second smartest guy in the world on Substack also reported on it and has recently published an update writing that now we have a more robust and far more damning view of this carefully distributed depopulation scheme.
[01:10:01.601 --> 01:10:22.266]  Back in Ohio of 2021, the Exposé publishes a report on data found in the USA's VAERS, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which reveals that 100% of COVID-19 vaccine deaths had been caused by just 5% of the batches.
[01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:24.487]  Batches that can be identified.
[01:10:24.927 --> 01:10:28.228]  And these deadly batches were not distributed evenly.
[01:10:28.968 --> 01:10:42.997]  The top eight states with the highest vaccination death rate, Kentucky, Arkansas, West Virginia, Montana, Alaska, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Tennessee, are all red states.
[01:10:44.477 --> 01:10:47.739]  19 of the top 24 on the list are red states.
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:53.063]  And California has been the least affected by the deadly lots of COVID vaccine.
[01:10:53.863 --> 01:11:08.646]  The numbers show that Kentucky has a 1,900% worse vaccination death rate than California, suggesting that Kentucky received 20 times the amount of deadly batches than California did.
[01:11:09.429 --> 01:11:24.399]  Florida, number 20 on the list of most vaccine deaths per vaccination, received three times the amount of deadly batches than California, with its vaccination death rate at 200% higher than California's.
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:38.909]  The author points out that these deadly batches would be better classified as rapid kill lots and slow kill lots, as we are now seeing more evidence that they kill over time.
[01:11:40.407 --> 01:11:45.713]  And the evidence shows that red states were targeted with the rapid kill shots.
[01:11:46.614 --> 01:12:00.371]  This would go along with the United Nations Agenda 2030 plan, which seeks to move the entire population into crowded cities and federalize all of flyover country in the name of climate change.
[01:12:01.653 --> 01:12:06.897]  They have less than seven years to accomplish this, and they are deadly serious about it.
[01:12:07.838 --> 01:12:08.338]  The U.S.
[01:12:08.358 --> 01:12:17.925]  government is in lockstep with the United Nations, and they will resort to murder and democide to accomplish their goals of total control.
[01:12:18.766 --> 01:12:24.152]  Many are suggesting that this is what is happening in East Palestine, Ohio, right now.
[01:12:24.872 --> 01:12:33.381]  The people of America are under attack by their own government, who is never going to quit until they accomplish their goals, or unless they are stopped.
[01:12:34.122 --> 01:12:53.161]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.

[01:13:49.867 --> 01:13:51.709]  You really need to get vaccinated.
[01:13:51.989 --> 01:13:56.233]  You know, COVID vaccines are now available for children 5 years and older.
[01:13:56.594 --> 01:14:01.634]   and the more people who get them, the better we're going to be able to help stop the spread of COVID.
[01:14:01.634 --> 01:14:05.634]  [Music]
[01:14:05.634 --> 01:14:08.634]  Bill Gates ain't Willy Wonka.
[01:14:08.797 --> 01:14:10.798]  He ain't doing this for like a competition.
[01:14:10.818 --> 01:14:12.419]  There's no golden ticket at the end of this.
[01:14:12.739 --> 01:14:15.261]  It's like a not-for-profit organization's making profit.
[01:14:15.301 --> 01:14:17.562]  An incredible amount of influence in areas that he profits from.
[01:14:17.942 --> 01:14:27.708]  All sorts of peculiar business practices like in India and on the continent of Africa that have led to like palpable suffering and profit in his case.
[01:14:27.748 --> 01:14:32.851]  The Africa thing is wild and that's a big part of this The Real Anthony Fauci book.
[01:14:33.351 --> 01:14:41.135]  He talks about Bill Gates quite a bit, and one of the things he talks about is how they've always used Africa as a place where they test out medicines.
[01:14:41.676 --> 01:14:45.658]  They've used Africa as a place where they test out... This is another thing that I learned from Alex Jones.
[01:14:46.158 --> 01:14:54.683]  Alex Jones was saying that they were giving kids the polio vaccine in Africa, and that Bill Gates was involved in this, and they had to stop doing it because it was actually giving kids polio.
[01:14:54.983 --> 01:14:55.764]  And I was like, what?! !
[01:14:56.864 --> 01:14:58.827]  And they pull up an AP article.
[01:14:59.027 --> 01:15:08.398]  There was an AP story about this, and it shows this terrified little African baby, and they're dropping the polio vaccine in his mouth, like, squeezing his face, dropping his mouth.
[01:15:08.418 --> 01:15:10.180]  I'm like, what the fuck, man?
[01:15:10.681 --> 01:15:13.944]  They gave kids polio with a vaccine?
[01:15:15.077 --> 01:15:26.363]  Even when you accept everything that they say, at this late point when it appears impossible to do that, they wouldn't release patents so that African nations could recreate the vaccines over there.
[01:15:26.403 --> 01:15:27.883]  So clearly there's a profit motive.
[01:15:27.903 --> 01:15:30.324]  And I saw him publicly talk about that and say, oh no, it's not as simple as that.
[01:15:30.344 --> 01:15:31.785]  You can't just give people the patents and stuff like that.
[01:15:32.085 --> 01:15:43.351]  But it seems like if you recognize that what drives them always is power, finance, and dominion, if you always look at that and then track their actions, you hardly ever see a disruption in that pattern.
[01:15:43.891 --> 01:16:03.919]  These characters that have become so maligned and marginalised, even in my lifetime where I still worked in mainstream media, people like Alex Jones or David Icke, they were, like, even people that were sceptical about them, or even people that ridiculed them, didn't try to posit them as dangerous.
[01:16:04.499 --> 01:16:06.760]  And the same, I'm assuming, with Robert Kennedy.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:10.602]  Well, the David Icke one, they always made fun of him for lizard people.
[01:16:10.902 --> 01:16:15.827]  Because he always would say that they're shapeshifters and they're lizards and there was no evidence.
[01:16:15.887 --> 01:16:17.328]  It just seemed really preposterous.
[01:16:17.749 --> 01:16:23.714]  And then, in the beginning of the pandemic, he was trying to connect COVID with 5G.
[01:16:24.235 --> 01:16:25.716]  There was a lot of weird, like...
[01:16:26.537 --> 01:16:28.079]  He's got some squirrely ones.
[01:16:28.459 --> 01:16:37.968]  Believe it or not, it's hard to say to the general public, Alex Jones is way more reliable than David Icke, but he's way more reliable than David Icke.
[01:16:38.469 --> 01:16:46.316]  Alex made a tremendous mistake with Sandy Hook, and he did that in a time of his life where he's experiencing a psychotic break.
[01:16:47.017 --> 01:17:08.015]  He was drinking a lot and he was having a mental breakdown and he really believed that everything was a conspiracy and that the government is essentially run by these evil demons who are trying to depopulate America and ruin people and he thought they were trying to take away people's guns and he was convinced that someone had convinced him.
[01:17:08.035 --> 01:17:18.452]   I don't know how I don't know what documentaries or what videos he saw, but he was convinced that they were using crisis actors and that they were orchestrating a false flag.
[01:17:18.492 --> 01:17:19.774]  He was obviously very wrong.
[01:17:21.527 --> 01:17:26.068]  And he's admitted that he was wrong about that, but he's been right about a lot of things.
[01:17:26.488 --> 01:17:27.368]  So many things.
[01:17:27.908 --> 01:17:34.930]  And I've talked about this many times, but he was the guy who told me about Epstein's Island more than a decade ago, and I thought it was the craziest thing I'd ever heard.
[01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:36.490]  I was like, what are you saying?
[01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:37.930]  There's an island?
[01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:39.791]  Like, it sounds like a plot in a movie.
[01:17:40.051 --> 01:17:50.653]  There's an island where they fly famous, rich scientists and politicians, and they compromise them with underage girls and get it on film?
[01:17:51.053 --> 01:17:52.314]  So they could use it against them?
[01:17:52.374 --> 01:17:52.914]  Like, what?
[01:17:53.374 --> 01:17:54.154]  That sounds like horcrux.
[01:17:54.355 --> 01:17:55.515]  That sounds like lizard people.
[01:17:55.535 --> 01:17:57.996]  It sounds like, you know, 5G creates COVID.
[01:17:58.016 --> 01:17:58.496]  Same thing.
[01:17:58.957 --> 01:17:59.177]  Yeah.
[01:17:59.197 --> 01:18:00.898]  But turns out it was true.
[01:18:01.378 --> 01:18:02.938]  And it's one of many things.
[01:18:03.018 --> 01:18:05.980]  He was the first one to warn me about a social credit score system.
[01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:21.049]  He's like, they're going to try to implement a social credit score system, and your money is going to be tied, they'll have centralized digital currency, and your money will be tied to your social credit score system, and you step out of line, you won't be able to buy things, you won't be able to travel, you won't be able to do anything.
[01:18:21.109 --> 01:18:26.072]  They're going to try to keep you within a 15 minute radius of your home, and they're starting to do that in places.
[01:18:26.172 --> 01:18:26.812]  All of it's real.
[01:18:27.053 --> 01:18:31.675]  And in China, the social credit score system is 100% real and implemented.
[01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:33.957]  How many of you's got the backs?
[01:18:38.134 --> 01:18:38.974]  A few of yous.
[01:18:38.994 --> 01:18:40.495]  You probably had to get it right.
[01:18:40.695 --> 01:18:42.235]  Were you forced to get the backs?
[01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:43.016]  Yeah.
[01:18:43.496 --> 01:18:47.237]  Boy, what a... That makes me mad they forced people to get the backs.
[01:18:47.557 --> 01:18:50.798]  I hope they have to pay for that, what they did to us.
[01:18:51.459 --> 01:18:58.941]  Did you get any of that myocarditis or the facial paralysis or, you know, the adult dropping dead syndrome or any of that sh**?
[01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:00.902]  Did any of that?
[01:19:01.822 --> 01:19:03.423]  What happened to people?
[01:19:04.571 --> 01:19:10.918]  That they start believing, for some reason, that this government had their best interest at heart?
[01:19:10.938 --> 01:19:12.100]  Ha ha ha!
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:14.723]  Ha ha ha!
[01:19:15.924 --> 01:19:19.068]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:19:19.007 --> 01:19:21.007]  What?
[01:19:21.007 --> 01:19:26.846]  What?
[01:19:26.846 --> 01:19:36.846]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:19:29.102 --> 01:19:38.925]  My whole family's a bunch of libtards, you know, as I said, and they've called me a conspiracy theorist the whole time, but everything I said turned out to be true.
[01:19:39.285 --> 01:19:40.705]  Did they apologize?
[01:19:41.105 --> 01:19:42.286]  Hell no!
[01:19:44.426 --> 01:19:45.787]  They never apologize.
[01:19:47.447 --> 01:19:48.908]  They never admit they're wrong, do they?
[01:19:49.508 --> 01:19:54.049]  Now, my whole family is sick, what, with blood clots and this and that and the other.
[01:19:54.129 --> 01:19:55.109]  They're all sick.
[01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:56.710]  I'm the only healthy one.
[01:19:58.011 --> 01:20:00.011]  I'm gonna miss them.
[01:20:00.011 --> 01:20:02.011]  (laughter)
[01:20:02.011 --> 01:20:04.011]  (applause)
[01:20:04.011 --> 01:20:06.011]  (laughter)
[01:20:06.011 --> 01:20:08.011]  What happened to people though?
[01:20:07.495 --> 01:20:32.565]   How can they line up to take these shots from this government, knowing that this government gave smallpox-infested blankets to the First Nations people, gave syphilis to black prisoners in Tuskegee, Told us there was weapons of mass destruction before they leveled Iraq and destroyed Libya.
[01:20:33.145 --> 01:20:37.406]  Told us Fen-Phen was safe and then all the fucking fat people died.
[01:20:41.488 --> 01:20:42.348]  What happened?
[01:20:43.148 --> 01:20:45.930]  And they're like, hey, can I get that booster?
[01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:49.452]  Can I get that shot and those 15 boosters?
[01:20:49.732 --> 01:20:54.815]  Would you mind giving my daughter here that shot right in her eyeball after she's born?
[01:20:55.156 --> 01:20:57.457]  Could you give her 10 of those right in the eyeball?
[01:20:57.777 --> 01:21:00.979]  Could you give her a shot right in her little baby clitoris?
[01:21:01.059 --> 01:21:03.761]  Could you do that for me, Mr. Biden?
[01:21:04.221 --> 01:21:05.722]  What's wrong with people?
[01:21:07.243 --> 01:21:08.144]  Misinformation.
[01:21:09.571 --> 01:21:15.453]  The greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic has been the United States government.
[01:21:16.233 --> 01:21:25.116]  Misinformation that COVID was spread through surface transmission, that vaccinated immunity was far greater than natural immunity, that masks were effective.
[01:21:25.156 --> 01:21:27.316]  Now we have the definitive Cochrane Review.
[01:21:27.356 --> 01:21:28.417]  What do you do with that review?
[01:21:28.737 --> 01:21:34.398]  Cochrane is the most authoritative evidence body in all of medicine and has been for decades.
[01:21:34.438 --> 01:21:36.279]  Do you just ignore it, not talk about it?
[01:21:38.644 --> 01:21:42.890]  That myocarditis was more common after the infection than the vaccine.
[01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:43.571]  Not true.
[01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:48.599]  It's 4 to 28 times more common after the vaccine.
[01:21:48.739 --> 01:21:50.581]  The young people benefit from a booster.
[01:21:50.942 --> 01:21:51.843]  Misinformation.
[01:21:52.124 --> 01:21:54.908]  Our two top experts on vaccines quit.
[01:21:55.663 --> 01:22:03.851]  The FDA in protest over this particular issue, pushing boosters in young, healthy people.
[01:22:03.991 --> 01:22:05.292]  The data was never there.
[01:22:05.713 --> 01:22:10.858]  That's why the CDC never disclosed hospitalization rates among boosted Americans under age 50.
[01:22:12.439 --> 01:22:15.322]  The vaccine mandates would increase vaccination rates.
[01:22:15.382 --> 01:22:18.966]  The George Mason University study shows it didn't.
[01:22:20.086 --> 01:22:20.807]  It did one thing.
[01:22:21.467 --> 01:22:26.792]  It created never-vaxxers who are now not getting the childhood vaccines they need to get.
[01:22:29.854 --> 01:22:35.699]  Over and over again, we've seen something that goes far beyond using your best judgment with the information at hand.
[01:22:35.759 --> 01:22:44.227]  We've seen something which is unforgivable, and that is the weaponization of medical research itself.
[01:22:44.867 --> 01:22:55.716]  The CDC putting out their own shoddy studies, like their own study on natural immunity, looking at one state for two months, when they had data for years on all 50 states.
[01:22:55.816 --> 01:22:59.199]  Why did they only report that one sliver of data?
[01:22:59.239 --> 01:23:01.461]  Why did they salami slice the giant database?
[01:23:01.681 --> 01:23:03.442]  Because it gave them the result they wanted.
[01:23:03.542 --> 01:23:05.104]  Same with masking study.
[01:23:05.144 --> 01:23:08.947]  Well, the data has now caught up in giant systematic reviews.
[01:23:09.888 --> 01:23:13.231]  And the public health officials were intellectually dishonest.
[01:23:13.291 --> 01:23:13.731]  They lied.
[01:23:14.127 --> 01:23:14.987]  To the American people.
[01:23:15.347 --> 01:23:15.707]  Thank you.
[01:23:20.068 --> 01:23:23.509]  So first of all, this is pure member state competence.
[01:23:24.529 --> 01:23:29.130]  Therefore, in respect to that, it's not me to give any kind of recommendation.
[01:23:30.710 --> 01:23:47.241]   If you're asking me what my personal position is, two or three years ago, I would never have thought to witness What we see right now that we have this horrible pandemic.
[01:23:48.542 --> 01:23:56.765]  We have the vaccines, the lifesaving vaccines, but they are not being used adequately everywhere.
[01:23:58.186 --> 01:24:05.008]  And thus, this costs, of course, an enormous or this is an enormous health cost coming along.
[01:24:05.888 --> 01:24:11.490]  If you look at the numbers, we have now 77 percent of the adults in the European Union vaccinated.
[01:24:11.550 --> 01:24:15.090]   Or if you take the whole population, It's 66%.
[01:24:16.511 --> 01:24:20.833]  And this means one third of the European population is not vaccinated.
[01:24:21.333 --> 01:24:23.354]  These are 150 million people.
[01:24:23.935 --> 01:24:24.795]  This is a lot.
[01:24:26.256 --> 01:24:29.538]  And not each and everyone can be vaccinated.
[01:24:29.598 --> 01:24:34.260]  So there are very small children, for example, or people with special medical conditions.
[01:24:35.101 --> 01:24:36.722]  But the vast majority could.
[01:24:37.902 --> 01:24:43.484]   And therefore, I think It is understandable and appropriate to lead this
[01:24:43.484 --> 01:24:50.373]   discussion now, how we can encourage and potentially think about mandatory
[01:24:50.373 --> 01:24:53.244]  vaccination within the European Union.
[01:24:53.244 --> 01:25:02.363]   This needs discussion, this needs a common approach, but it is a discussion that I think has to be led.
[01:25:03.083 --> 01:25:04.604]  I have written to...
[01:25:04.604 --> 01:25:07.363]  Well, it's a special...
[01:25:07.363 --> 01:25:11.883]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:25:11.883 --> 01:25:19.364]   Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:25:19.397 --> 01:25:21.859]  Well, it's a special live Saturday broadcast.
[01:25:22.219 --> 01:25:24.781]  I'm your host Alex Jones, hosting the great Roseanne Barr.
[01:25:25.222 --> 01:25:27.584]  We may go an hour, we may go two hours, however long she wants to go.
[01:25:27.624 --> 01:25:29.765]  I've talked to her for years on the phone, followed her work.
[01:25:29.786 --> 01:25:31.847]  She got de-platformed back when I did four years ago.
[01:25:31.887 --> 01:25:33.709]  We were some of the first they went after.
[01:25:34.249 --> 01:25:55.941]   And she is a Peabody Award for Television Excellence, several Humanities Awards, Emmys, several Golden Globes, multiple People's Choice Awards, the Eleanor Roosevelt Freedom of Speech Award, a whole bunch of Nickelodeon Awards, a bunch of MTV Awards, and she's here With us to cover joy and how to not let them get us down and break our will you know, it's funny I was gonna try to bring that up had no idea.
[01:25:55.982 --> 01:26:22.921]   I didn't talk to her before the interview She's agreed last week to come in But I was gonna talk about how I've learned not let them get me down and the key is not letting them destroy our joy And and I swear she just said I want to talk about joy and I want to talk about the reality of where we are So it's so good to have her but let me just tell you something they ban our URLs every few months and So ConspiracyFact.info took you to Banned.video and the live feed of the show so you can promote it on Twitter, Facebook, email, you name it.
[01:26:23.241 --> 01:26:25.162]  All that stuff getting censored with the big tech companies.
[01:26:25.182 --> 01:26:25.922]  You're on Google Mail.
[01:26:27.122 --> 01:26:33.205]  Today, an hour and a half ago before we went live, I tested ConspiracyFact.info.
[01:26:33.545 --> 01:26:34.905]  You can post it on Twitter.
[01:26:36.186 --> 01:26:38.027]  Roseanne tried to put it out.
[01:26:38.367 --> 01:26:43.689]  They tried to tweet it out 30 minutes ago, and it will not let you tweet ConspiracyFact.info.
[01:26:44.029 --> 01:26:58.822]   So in live time, The controllers who lied about the shots, and lied about the origin of the virus, and who lied about masks, and lied about blocking vitamin C, and vitamin D3, and hydroxychloroquine, and all the rest of it.
[01:27:00.102 --> 01:27:13.366]  Those very same people are now watching us in live time, so scared of this woman, that they literally banned sharing conspiracyfact.info in the last hour.
[01:27:14.943 --> 01:27:15.883]  Confirmed, can't do it.
[01:27:16.524 --> 01:27:20.465]  But you can get around that to tell folks, hey, and we're not allowed to tell you where Alex Jones is, but everybody knows.
[01:27:21.145 --> 01:27:22.326]  Everybody share the link.
[01:27:22.646 --> 01:27:23.206]  Everybody share.
[01:27:23.226 --> 01:27:32.575]   Hey, Alex Jones is on Roseanne Barr right now to cover Bombshell Info and they censored Alex to a new level and Roseanne to a new level today because they're so scared.
[01:27:32.795 --> 01:27:34.257]  The power is in we the people.
[01:27:34.317 --> 01:27:38.903]  It's in you deciding on this special emergency Saturday broadcast that you won't be censored.
[01:27:39.163 --> 01:27:42.807]  But tell folks, hey, you're not allowed to share the link, but you know where Alex Jones is.
[01:27:43.308 --> 01:27:46.532]  Put spaces in InfoWars or whatever, however you can get it out.
[01:27:46.952 --> 01:27:48.853]  Your email list, your text message, your word of mouth.
[01:27:49.274 --> 01:27:50.955]  Everybody tells everybody to tune in right now.
[01:27:51.255 --> 01:27:53.036]  We'll get 20 million viewers, not a million viewers.
[01:27:53.437 --> 01:27:54.037]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:27:54.057 --> 01:27:56.138]  At the end of the day, we're going to win because The Great Awakening is here.
[01:27:56.519 --> 01:27:57.539]  Positive things are happening.
[01:27:57.559 --> 01:27:59.161]  Before we went live, Roseanne, it's great to have you here.
[01:27:59.621 --> 01:28:01.462]  I said, do you believe we're winning in The Awakening is here?
[01:28:01.502 --> 01:28:02.423]  You said, absolutely.
[01:28:02.443 --> 01:28:03.924]  That's what I came here to talk about.
[01:28:03.944 --> 01:28:05.705]  So I'm going to try to shut up and give you the floor.
[01:28:05.725 --> 01:28:08.387]  By the way, you look amazing in person.
[01:28:08.407 --> 01:28:08.747]  Thank you.
[01:28:09.268 --> 01:28:10.509]  Thank you very much.
[01:28:11.289 --> 01:28:12.710]  Well, I feel amazing.
[01:28:13.431 --> 01:28:16.353]  Um, uh, well, I better take these off.
[01:28:16.433 --> 01:28:22.878]  I just wanted to show, I got these in New York and they, they're this really cool color you can't see anywhere.
[01:28:23.518 --> 01:28:24.739]  I like, I like those glasses.
[01:28:24.939 --> 01:28:25.579]  Aren't they cool?
[01:28:25.599 --> 01:28:29.963]  And they kind of match my whole thing that I like, my outfit.
[01:28:30.103 --> 01:28:34.466]  I've been loving your very daring comedy, like just coming right out with a poison shot.
[01:28:34.786 --> 01:28:35.647]  And you're getting nothing but love.
[01:28:36.787 --> 01:28:38.788]  I am so overwhelmed with it.
[01:28:38.988 --> 01:28:41.429]  I mean, I never felt it before.
[01:28:41.509 --> 01:28:43.310]  Maybe I was afraid to feel it, you know.
[01:28:43.731 --> 01:28:51.415]  But once you get knocked real far down, you just start needing to feel love from people, you know.
[01:28:51.535 --> 01:28:52.595]  You know that, Alex, too.
[01:28:53.336 --> 01:28:55.617]  But yeah, I feel great love.
[01:28:55.657 --> 01:28:59.279]  And it made me, like, fill back up again.
[01:28:59.359 --> 01:29:06.337]   And remember, Hey, the joy of being together and the joy of me telling jokes that make people laugh.
[01:29:06.817 --> 01:29:09.539]  That's kind of the reason I'm alive.
[01:29:09.579 --> 01:29:25.253]   You know that that's whole reason I'm here on this planet that makes me so happy and I love seeing people laugh again and telling them real like The most offensively true things I could come up with.
[01:29:25.373 --> 01:29:37.158]  Like, you know, like telling people the truth, and seeing it hit them right before my eyes, and then seeing them laugh about it, is very healing and powerful.
[01:29:38.559 --> 01:29:56.573]  Yeah, so I wanted to be here on a very powerful day and to say things that are powerfully meaningful to me, and also to be with you, Alex, because you're a hero of mine, and you've been telling the truth for a long time, and when you're wrong, you admit it, and that's something very, very rare.
[01:29:57.313 --> 01:29:58.935]  You know, that is something really rare.
[01:29:58.995 --> 01:30:02.158]  I've seen you say, yeah, I'll admit it when I'm wrong.
[01:30:02.758 --> 01:30:05.101]  That makes you a human being.
[01:30:05.461 --> 01:30:09.485]  And a lot of these people that are on media, they never do that.
[01:30:10.005 --> 01:30:14.029]  Plus, they never say they're sorry for the people they've harmed when they are wrong.
[01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:16.311]  They aren't human.
[01:30:16.972 --> 01:30:19.794]  I think they're, are they cyborgs or robots?
[01:30:19.854 --> 01:30:20.214]  I don't know.
[01:30:20.234 --> 01:30:25.439]  But they, they don't display human characteristics like empathy or caring for their fellow human.
[01:30:26.199 --> 01:30:29.942]  It's like they've all bought into this thing and they are robotic.
[01:30:30.062 --> 01:30:31.583]  And anyway, I wanted to be here today.
[01:30:31.984 --> 01:30:33.705]  It's a powerful Jewish day.
[01:30:34.045 --> 01:30:42.092]  And I wanted to speak as a Jew because everybody's always talking about the Jews and some Jews are saying they're Jews, but I can tell they're not.
[01:30:42.532 --> 01:31:06.566]  But I'm a Jewie Jew and today is a very important Jewish day because it's the Shabbat before Purim and Purim is the boomerang and the boomerang is coming and I feel it because that's my religion and I do practice it and also I wanted to tell people some secret stuff that you know I figure this is the age of enlightenment so I'm going to share it.
[01:31:07.342 --> 01:31:14.367]  And today is Shabbat, so that means Satan does not exist today because he cannot exist on a holy day.
[01:31:14.447 --> 01:31:17.208]  He can't live anywhere in holy space.
[01:31:17.769 --> 01:31:20.811]  So that means that our prayers go straight to God today.
[01:31:20.871 --> 01:31:24.453]  He can't interfere or F with them or nothing else.
[01:31:24.873 --> 01:31:30.860]  And I'm here to pray with Alex today because I've seen Alex pray on this show and I believe his prayers.
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:33.443]  I believe he is a soul, has a living soul.
[01:31:34.124 --> 01:31:39.530]  And people who have living souls watch Alex and they are touched by his prayers as was I.
[01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:42.111]  And I'm somebody who prays, too.
[01:31:42.211 --> 01:31:57.075]  I used to have a talk show, and I asked people on that talk show, surrounded by 28 lawyers who were trying to prevent me from doing it, but I asked people to pray to send a storm away from the coast of Florida, and it actually moved.
[01:31:57.936 --> 01:32:00.156]  And so I believe in the power of prayer.
[01:32:00.937 --> 01:32:02.117]  I really, really do.
[01:32:02.597 --> 01:32:05.298]  And, you know, I want to pray with you today, Alex.
[01:32:05.862 --> 01:32:20.949]  I came here because I want people to pray with us that we can overcome all machinery that has ties to the satanic lower world of evil, that we break all those ties, all those satanic vows that people have taken.
[01:32:21.349 --> 01:32:55.248]   May they be cut today, may they not exist tomorrow, and may the souls of the human beings who care for other human beings And for this country and what it stands for, which is a melting pot of individual rights, not group rights where people are punished for things they didn't do, but for justice and equality, including women like me, who have the power to speak freely and to own property and to work it with the sweat of their brow.
[01:32:56.593 --> 01:32:57.274]  That's beautiful.
[01:32:57.294 --> 01:32:57.934]  Please pray.
[01:32:58.074 --> 01:33:06.460]  ...on their knees to a big elitist group who think of us as their slaves or their prey.
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:11.523]  May that end today, and I ask you, Alex, to say amen with me.
[01:33:11.763 --> 01:33:12.103]  Amen.
[01:33:12.263 --> 01:33:14.225]  Continue the prayer, Alex.
[01:33:14.845 --> 01:33:17.687]  I'm turning it over to you now, because I know you can do it.
[01:33:19.890 --> 01:33:27.033]  I know that no matter what group we come from or what our backgrounds are, there is a real God that created the universe and consciousness.
[01:33:27.833 --> 01:33:31.454]  And we think about the fact that what would there be if there was nothingness?
[01:33:31.995 --> 01:33:35.336]  No planets, no universe, no God, no humans, no nothing.
[01:33:35.956 --> 01:33:40.398]  In all of eternity, in all time, how could there be nothing?
[01:33:41.158 --> 01:33:46.180]  And then you ask the question, well, what could bring something out of nothing that is God?
[01:33:47.102 --> 01:34:10.006]   And so I know that being humble before God is essential, and realizing that we are really not God, but an expression of God's consciousness and will, and the fact that God wants to be able to commune with us forever, and God was basically lonely, so made creatures that have free will. But that's a gamble because God loves
[01:34:10.006 --> 01:34:15.855]   us so much and God knows some of us, because we're given free will, will join with things that
[01:34:15.855 --> 01:34:22.405]   are not good, that are bad. And so if God did anything wrong, and I'm not saying God did, it's
[01:34:22.405 --> 01:34:25.175]   the fact that God gave us freedom to do bad things.
[01:34:25.407 --> 01:34:27.647]  The Satanists always say, well, God allowed all this to go on.
[01:34:27.928 --> 01:34:28.688]  Your God does this.
[01:34:28.748 --> 01:34:31.949]  No, God gave us consciousness and creation.
[01:34:31.989 --> 01:34:41.892]  So in front of the Heavenly Father of the universe and all space and time and all dimensions that created this for us to experience incredible enlightenment and be able to interface with God.
[01:34:42.312 --> 01:34:43.872]  I just thank God for this moment.
[01:34:43.912 --> 01:34:45.753]  We're here together for eternity.
[01:34:45.913 --> 01:34:51.094]   And I ask that God move in people's hearts, souls and minds and bring us to the Amen.
[01:34:51.054 --> 01:34:54.413]   place the most high the King David talked about so that we can transcend
[01:34:54.413 --> 01:34:59.293]   this evil and make the right choice in eternity to join God and experience
[01:34:59.293 --> 01:35:03.413]   things the eye has not seen the ear has not heard and I'm just so blessed to be
[01:35:03.413 --> 01:35:06.614]   here with Roseanne Barr during the middle of this incredible awakening
[01:35:06.614 --> 01:35:19.974]   that's taking place right now amen amen and now a new prayer that that all those
[01:35:19.974 --> 01:35:29.773]   who do have the spark of a soul in them in a in the most high positions of power
[01:35:29.773 --> 01:35:40.373]   will feel that spark grow and they will remove themselves just simply by resigning
[01:35:40.244 --> 01:35:57.495]  For the sins they've committed against the children of this world, may they just grow enough soul to kindly remove themselves and may God guide a person of wisdom and ethics and morality to replace them.
[01:35:58.135 --> 01:36:00.557]  May that happen immediately.
[01:36:00.577 --> 01:36:22.238]   I was also going to talk about Mind control and how, and I want to say amen to that and end it, but I also want to talk about mind control that we have all been under in our country and we continue to be under, which I'm talking about in my act.
[01:36:22.298 --> 01:36:25.102]  Like, why are people just lining up to do?
[01:36:25.703 --> 01:36:45.022]  When I see how they're doing, like people with these German accents telling us to take these shots and they're using the Jewish people basically over there in Israel as the lab rats to do it on and they're lining up to do it, I know that this is the end of time.
[01:36:46.203 --> 01:36:47.984]  You know, I know that this is the end.
[01:36:48.104 --> 01:36:48.925]  It's so surreal.
[01:36:49.325 --> 01:36:51.266]  I mean, Yetnyahu, I'm not even against him.
[01:36:51.286 --> 01:36:51.726]  I'm not attacking him.
[01:36:51.746 --> 01:36:53.648]  He says, oh, Israel's so lucky.
[01:36:53.748 --> 01:36:54.868]  We've got rid of the laws.
[01:36:55.229 --> 01:36:58.571]  Now we can test on our people any drugs and find out what they do.
[01:36:58.591 --> 01:37:07.336]  And then it's weirdos with German accents, like Legrand and, and, and, and, and I can't even say his name, Klaus Schwab.
[01:37:07.496 --> 01:37:09.017]  He's going to take over your body.
[01:37:09.518 --> 01:37:10.578]  He's going to control you.
[01:37:10.638 --> 01:37:12.640]  I mean, it's, it's like, it's overtly satanic.
[01:37:13.422 --> 01:37:14.923]  It is overtly satanic.
[01:37:15.103 --> 01:37:19.885]  And it's like our task, if we have any intelligence or soul, to see it.
[01:37:19.985 --> 01:37:31.571]  But like, you look at the amount of people walking around that aren't even seeing what's in front of their face, but they see like what the Queen, they're interested in what the Queen of England's up to.
[01:37:31.992 --> 01:37:33.693]  That's because of mind control.
[01:37:34.113 --> 01:37:39.976]  Because what MKUltra Mind Control does is prevent you from seeing what's right in front of your face.
[01:37:40.456 --> 01:37:48.283]  And that's why I thought the quarantine had a good silver lining to it, because you were forced to stay in your own house with your own family and see what's right.
[01:37:48.303 --> 01:37:49.985]  I was about to say, I think it backfired.
[01:37:50.005 --> 01:37:51.326]  Their big power grab backfired.
[01:37:51.566 --> 01:37:52.747]  Can you speak to the Great Awakening?
[01:37:52.767 --> 01:37:56.691]  How do you think Team Humanity, Team Freedom versus Team Demon is doing right now?
[01:37:57.352 --> 01:38:05.540]  Well I think they can't fight us because one thing they don't know nothing about is the human soul and the human spirit so they don't even know how to fight it.
[01:38:05.901 --> 01:38:16.091]  All they can do is just blow up stuff and cause earthquakes with their earthquake and heart attack machines and stuff like that and they're just trying to kill everybody or kill as many people as they can.
[01:38:16.491 --> 01:38:17.852]  They don't like thinkers.
[01:38:17.912 --> 01:38:28.180]  They're trying to get rid of all the thinkers, especially thinkers like you and me, Alex, because we talk to people and they don't like communicators neither, or people who can receive information.
[01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:40.409]  They like people who can't receive information, just people who can take stuff in through their eyes, memes and stuff when they look at screens, and then live their lives trying to replicate that.
[01:38:40.549 --> 01:38:42.691]  They don't like anybody who can hear.
[01:38:43.271 --> 01:38:45.272]  And that's why I like that prayer here.
[01:38:45.692 --> 01:38:50.414]  Oh Israel, you know here that hearing is the most important thing.
[01:38:50.875 --> 01:39:00.719]  It's before seeing hearing the word is the most important thing and that's why the word that we're talking right now is very very important to wakening people up.
[01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:06.342]  Hearing wakes people up more than seeing because they can't see what's right in front of their face.
[01:39:06.702 --> 01:39:16.427]  Although a lot of more people can like the quarantine when they was trying to bust down, you know, our economy and make everybody who was a small business owner go broke.
[01:39:16.487 --> 01:39:17.867]  That was why they was doing it.
[01:39:18.507 --> 01:39:29.192]  But, you know, so then they can move in like, you know, Katrina, I think, was the first time they was just trying it out, you know, how they go and martial law, gun conversation, all of it.
[01:39:29.432 --> 01:39:34.135]  Well, destroying a city and then going in after, you know, that's rock bottom prices.
[01:39:34.295 --> 01:39:45.701]  But what you said about here, rather than see, studies show this, that watching stuff, that's all you do, causes brain neurons to die.
[01:39:45.881 --> 01:39:46.081]  Yeah.
[01:39:46.902 --> 01:39:48.323]  And Alzheimer's, neurological disorders.
[01:39:48.683 --> 01:39:55.407]  But if you read a book or you hear something, your brain is forced to access old memories and other things and build a composite.
[01:39:55.727 --> 01:39:57.228]  So your brain is creating the movie.
[01:39:58.305 --> 01:40:00.886]  That increases neurons, increases IQ, increases health.
[01:40:01.247 --> 01:40:08.050]  And there is that beautiful Jewish knowledge that people attack all day, but that's what Christianity and Islam and everything came out of.
[01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.731]  It's very special.
[01:40:09.031 --> 01:40:12.112]  It's all the same thing, it's just got different names on it.
[01:40:12.413 --> 01:40:16.135]  Absolutely, but they got kicked off by the Jews who were actually writing down and doing it.
[01:40:16.455 --> 01:40:19.036]  Because writing, let's talk about writing for a minute.
[01:40:19.516 --> 01:40:26.900]  It is about writing because when you deprogram yourself, as per Kathy O'Brien in her book, Time to Heal.
[01:40:28.536 --> 01:40:42.684]  And her husband was a CIA guy who was into mind sciences, and he taught her that when the act of writing out an experience makes your mind engage, and you begin to heal.
[01:40:43.044 --> 01:40:45.066]  And that's why they outlawed writing in the school.
[01:40:45.086 --> 01:40:46.506]  That's how they're going to deprogram, is to write it down.
[01:40:46.526 --> 01:40:49.488]  In the schools now, it's all... That's when they debrief somebody, they'll say, write it.
[01:40:49.528 --> 01:40:49.868]  Write it.
[01:40:50.389 --> 01:40:51.109]  Don't read it!
[01:40:51.129 --> 01:40:52.470]  Because that gets into the deeper, yeah.
[01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:59.874]  Don't read it through the eyes, just write it, because writing engages part of your brain that trigger critical thinking.
[01:40:59.894 --> 01:41:03.316]  And this is key, so exactly, listening and writing.
[01:41:03.456 --> 01:41:05.698]  And that's why people ask, why do I put up text?
[01:41:05.738 --> 01:41:07.279]  I tell the crew, I don't want to be on screen.
[01:41:08.277 --> 01:41:10.639]  Everything I say, pull up text, because that engages the brain.
[01:41:11.059 --> 01:41:12.961]  And I'm using mind science there.
[01:41:13.001 --> 01:41:14.302]  I didn't get trained at some university.
[01:41:14.362 --> 01:41:14.802]  I know that.
[01:41:15.203 --> 01:41:18.505]  So we're like, if we tell you something, we show you the clip for yourself.
[01:41:18.866 --> 01:41:19.927]  Or we show you an article.
[01:41:19.967 --> 01:41:20.927]  Or we show you a definition.
[01:41:21.248 --> 01:41:23.570]  We want you to go look at that to trigger your brain.
[01:41:23.850 --> 01:41:24.070]  Right.
[01:41:24.090 --> 01:41:26.332]  Because we don't want to program you with a pre-program.
[01:41:26.352 --> 01:41:27.373]  We want to unlock your brain.
[01:41:27.853 --> 01:41:28.514]  Right.
[01:41:28.554 --> 01:41:32.017]  So the most powerful programming is the stuff you hear, too.
[01:41:32.077 --> 01:41:34.058]  So we hear it all goddamn day long.
[01:41:34.459 --> 01:41:35.800]  Excuse my French.
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:39.183]  But, you know, all day long we hear it.
[01:41:39.383 --> 01:41:42.566]  And people leave their TV on to CNN in the airports.
[01:41:42.606 --> 01:41:45.569]  And by the way, when you see me on my phone, I'm not ignoring you.
[01:41:45.649 --> 01:41:47.251]  I'm sending them links to put up on screen.
[01:41:47.657 --> 01:41:48.498]  Good for you.
[01:41:48.538 --> 01:41:51.100]  Well, I see these comedians go, what are you doing on your phone?
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:57.505]  Or Gavin McGinnis was in the studio a few weeks ago with Alex Stein and the crews on their phones, he blows up.
[01:41:57.805 --> 01:41:58.646]  What are you doing on your phones?
[01:41:58.666 --> 01:41:59.346]  You're never screwing around.
[01:41:59.366 --> 01:42:01.548]  No, when I'm on my phone, I'm not screwing around.
[01:42:01.568 --> 01:42:02.729]  I'm saying put this up, put that up.
[01:42:03.209 --> 01:42:03.830]  Keep going, Roseanne.
[01:42:03.970 --> 01:42:05.351]  I know you're never screwing around.
[01:42:05.391 --> 01:42:07.513]  You're serious of a fucking heart attack.
[01:42:07.593 --> 01:42:08.173]  I know that.
[01:42:08.513 --> 01:42:09.134]  And so am I.
[01:42:09.514 --> 01:42:10.355]  Exactly, so keep going.
[01:42:10.375 --> 01:42:20.080]  But we are for God, isn't that weird that, like, I learned this in such a weird way because I want to talk about how I was shown this because I really want people to know this.
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:26.184]  The other thing they brainwashed us into, there's something very, very important that I want to share because I learned it myself.
[01:42:26.624 --> 01:42:30.206]  They keep on talking about love, love, love, love, love, love, love.
[01:42:30.246 --> 01:42:31.987]  Well, love is great, but you know what?
[01:42:32.047 --> 01:42:36.329]  The vast majority of little children on this earth, they don't know what that is.
[01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:38.371]  They don't even know what that feeling is.
[01:42:38.431 --> 01:42:45.935]  And I want people to hear that and know it and wake up to it because that is the truth.
[01:42:46.015 --> 01:42:49.857]  The vast majority of little children on this earth, they don't know what love is.
[01:42:50.818 --> 01:42:51.218]  Hello?
[01:42:52.679 --> 01:42:54.941]  That's what we're fighting for right now.
[01:42:55.001 --> 01:42:59.326]  That's what the information war is about right now, are those children.
[01:42:59.346 --> 01:43:00.427]  Am I right, Alex?
[01:43:01.828 --> 01:43:00.427]  110%.
[01:43:01.848 --> 01:43:03.550]  They want to catch them early.
[01:43:04.708 --> 01:43:15.130]  Isolate them, have the state take them over, and we're here to get people to not listen to what we say, not believe what we're saying, but to simply unlock their minds, and God has given us tools to do it.
[01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:19.311]  So talk about that, and this important holiday.
[01:43:19.331 --> 01:43:21.691]  People say, well, I don't follow this, I don't follow that.
[01:43:21.711 --> 01:43:21.991]  No, no.
[01:43:22.431 --> 01:43:31.473]   Saturday's a very important day, as you were saying, and people need to really open their minds up, and really be aware of the system, and be aware that we should really thank God The awakening is huge.
[01:43:31.553 --> 01:43:35.034]  I mean, I was in an airport yesterday and used to, I'd shake 20 hands.
[01:43:35.074 --> 01:43:36.395]  I'd get one FU for every 20.
[01:43:36.915 --> 01:43:38.035]  I got nothing but love.
[01:43:38.715 --> 01:43:41.036]  And again, people say, I'm not, again, I'm not saying, Oh, I'm so popular.
[01:43:41.056 --> 01:43:41.476]  No, no, no, no.
[01:43:42.056 --> 01:43:43.416]  I'm this demonized person.
[01:43:43.816 --> 01:43:48.578]  And the system is so hated and distrusted now that people go automatically, well, this guy must be good.
[01:43:48.618 --> 01:43:50.658]  That, that says how weak the power structure is.
[01:43:51.498 --> 01:43:52.619]  It absolutely does.
[01:43:52.679 --> 01:43:57.460]  But they forget like the power structure, this big pyramids all about pyramids.
[01:43:57.861 --> 01:44:03.491]  Well, this pyramid that they constructed, the money people, I'm talking about the people who own the world.
[01:44:04.152 --> 01:44:08.600]  They forgot that the big old base that holds them up.
[01:44:10.812 --> 01:44:14.234]  You know, it has to be composed of living human beings.
[01:44:14.854 --> 01:44:18.716]  I guess they're going to replace it with cyborgs or robots or something.
[01:44:18.796 --> 01:44:19.896]  I don't know what.
[01:44:21.517 --> 01:44:30.921]  Or maybe just clones of people who really don't have any ties to each other, who can't do anything but attack or work.
[01:44:31.061 --> 01:44:31.461]  I don't know.
[01:44:31.481 --> 01:44:32.522]  Is that what they're after?
[01:44:32.722 --> 01:44:33.482]  No, I totally agree.
[01:44:33.502 --> 01:44:35.823]  That's what they want, is they want us to be... That's the Nazis' dream.
[01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:43.205]  And they brought the Nazis over, they took over our government, you know, with the... Look, everybody, this is what I want everybody to know.
[01:44:43.625 --> 01:44:49.187]  Every penny on this earth is accounted for, and it all goes back to the Bank of International Settlements.
[01:44:49.627 --> 01:44:53.228]  Every penny on earth is accounted for in Bern, Switzerland.
[01:44:53.548 --> 01:44:57.129]  So the same people are getting the same money from the same guys.
[01:44:57.509 --> 01:44:59.049]  That's what people don't understand.
[01:44:59.149 --> 01:45:05.360]   Like, the same people, the cartel people, are getting paid by the same people that, you know, the
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:12.500]   cartel, the pharmas, the pharma, you know, big pharma, big military, they're all getting the
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:14.110]  money from the same guys.
[01:45:14.110 --> 01:45:18.989]   And that's what I want people to know. There's only one source of money on this earth and
[01:45:18.989 --> 01:45:22.829]  they're all getting paid by that same money. Am I right?
[01:45:22.955 --> 01:45:24.836]  I totally agree, and you're right, you're dead on.
[01:45:25.256 --> 01:45:30.858]  International Bank of Settlements, after World War II, and the Marshall Plan, is the global system.
[01:45:31.298 --> 01:45:38.221]  And it's running China, it's running all of it, and it's bringing out this new central bank digital currency that tracks and controls everything we're talking about.
[01:45:38.241 --> 01:45:39.741]  We're talking about literal market of the beast.
[01:45:41.082 --> 01:45:42.002]  What is your view on that?
[01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:51.033]  Well, if you look at them castles in Switzerland and where they came from, which was Babylon and Pharaoh, you see, this has never stopped.
[01:45:51.493 --> 01:46:02.737]  It's still those same people in control and those same beliefs that they held are still in control of everyone in power still has to take that same oath or they don't get into power.
[01:46:03.477 --> 01:46:04.457]  People say, why don't they change?
[01:46:04.477 --> 01:46:05.318]  People don't get that.
[01:46:05.678 --> 01:46:06.878]  People don't get that.
[01:46:07.519 --> 01:46:13.119]   People don't get that that all goes back to Bern, Switzerland, too, founded in 1291 to
[01:46:13.119 --> 01:46:19.319]   launder what they stole from my people's holy temple, all that gold, all those implements.
[01:46:19.319 --> 01:46:24.798]   They created Switzerland, the Templars, and the, you know, who became the Jesuits, to
[01:46:24.798 --> 01:46:31.557]   launder that money of all the wars they caused and start, and the BIS decides what wars are
[01:46:31.557 --> 01:46:33.639]  going to go and what they're going to fund.
[01:46:33.639 --> 01:46:38.238]  You know, they funded every war, and they continue to.
[01:46:38.238 --> 01:46:41.759]  But Putin, he's making a big stink on that, isn't he?
[01:46:41.759 --> 01:46:43.838]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:46:43.884 --> 01:46:55.065]  The Vatican admits that Switzerland actually runs the Vatican and has its paramilitary arm everywhere, and that they did, during the Crusades, using Christians, haul all the wealth of the Middle East back to them.
[01:46:55.902 --> 01:47:12.902]  Well, you can't get to Rome without passing through the Arch of Titus, it's called, and above which, if you have a picture, is the depiction of them sacking the Temple of Jerusalem, the Second Temple, and carrying the Jews to Rome as slaves.
[01:47:13.502 --> 01:47:19.666]   Most of the Jewish women who lived At that time in Jerusalem were carried away as sex slaves.
[01:47:19.686 --> 01:47:20.687]  They don't ever say that.
[01:47:20.767 --> 01:47:22.207]  And for those that don't know, that's 70 AD.
[01:47:22.627 --> 01:47:25.408]  70 AD, Titus sacks Rome.
[01:47:25.748 --> 01:47:28.990]  Guys, pull up the Titus Arch Vatican.
[01:47:29.330 --> 01:47:31.170]  General Titus Arch Rome.
[01:47:31.190 --> 01:47:32.051]  I've seen it myself.
[01:47:32.391 --> 01:47:33.151]  But you're dead on.
[01:47:33.311 --> 01:47:34.171]  That's another key thing.
[01:47:34.211 --> 01:47:35.572]  Explain the sacking of Jerusalem.
[01:47:36.368 --> 01:47:45.254]  Well, they destroyed the second temple, Rome, you know, after the Hellenist Greeks destroyed one, then they got the other one.
[01:47:45.894 --> 01:47:47.716]  And that was in Jesus' time.
[01:47:47.736 --> 01:47:51.878]  And that's our temple menorah there.
[01:47:52.879 --> 01:47:57.983]  And they carried it to Rome, where they say it sits in the Vatican, but the Vatican denies that it does.
[01:47:58.403 --> 01:48:05.817]   But there's big, I guess I'm here as a tribal emissary of the You know, history of the Jewish people.
[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:07.604]  I know a lot about that.
[01:48:08.166 --> 01:48:08.789]  But, uh...
[01:48:10.123 --> 01:48:22.374]  Yeah, they say in our tribal lore, our Jewish lore, that they're actually the tribe of Benjamin created two temple menorahs and hid one because they knew that the Romans would come and take it.
[01:48:22.755 --> 01:48:31.583]  So they say that tribe of Benjamin hid one and Esther was a member of the of the tribe of Benjamin and so was Mordecai, her uncle.
[01:48:32.083 --> 01:48:45.550]   So they say that they're actually the real one is What do you make of John the Revelator?
[01:48:45.610 --> 01:48:48.891]  If you really read Revelation, it describes everything perfectly.
[01:48:49.311 --> 01:48:50.312]  What was he jacked into?
[01:48:51.012 --> 01:48:52.112]  What do you mean jacked into?
[01:48:52.132 --> 01:48:55.413]  I mean, John the Revelator in the book of Revelation.
[01:48:55.653 --> 01:48:56.274]  Yeah.
[01:48:56.314 --> 01:49:00.175]  What's your view of Christianity and things that Jesus taught and all that?
[01:49:01.175 --> 01:49:03.116]  Well, I know everything about that, too.
[01:49:03.796 --> 01:49:17.564]  And I think that, here's what I think the times we're living in now, I'm just going to put it like this, well, it says, you know, it says in our holy books 2,000 years ago, it totally describes the times we're living in now.
[01:49:17.744 --> 01:49:25.388]  It also foretells a computer and an age of instant information and intelligence.
[01:49:25.876 --> 01:49:33.503]  And data that can't be denied, and that that would be the hallmark of this age, and that I believe we are living in.
[01:49:33.883 --> 01:49:37.907]  And that is also called the age of messianic thought.
[01:49:38.627 --> 01:49:46.695]  And that... There's a lot of other things to go into.
[01:49:46.715 --> 01:49:50.398]  So what you're saying is the Great Awakening, the evil's coming in to block the Great Awakening?
[01:49:51.323 --> 01:49:55.064]  Yeah, it always has been stepping up, but here's the fact.
[01:49:55.664 --> 01:49:56.784]  It's already fallen.
[01:49:56.884 --> 01:49:58.864]  Babylon has already fallen.
[01:49:59.284 --> 01:50:10.146]  I believe that it fell a long, long time ago, and we're just feeling its thud and the vibration of... I agree.
[01:50:10.286 --> 01:50:13.227]  All this control is an attempt for Satan to regain what he lost.
[01:50:13.587 --> 01:50:20.548]  But he's already... I just want people to know, he has already been defeated, and God has already won.
[01:50:21.662 --> 01:50:24.306]  It's just you have to pick your side now.
[01:50:25.808 --> 01:50:29.093]  This is all about picking the right side.
[01:50:29.173 --> 01:50:31.496]  It's all about you, if you have a soul.
[01:50:32.159 --> 01:50:33.960]  You have to pick your side.
[01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:35.581]  That's what it's all about, I think.
[01:50:36.202 --> 01:50:45.247]  And people, they've been mind-screwed into picking the wrong side and tricked because the Satan is a trickster.
[01:50:45.868 --> 01:50:53.872]  And, you know, that's why people are lining up to take a shot that, you know, like I'm talking about, what it does to people.
[01:50:54.053 --> 01:51:01.159]   And then, and then the news comes on and And says, Oh, well, they don't know why that guy died of a heart attack at age 18.
[01:51:02.201 --> 01:51:05.324]  I mean, come on, you've got to see what's right in front of your face.
[01:51:05.384 --> 01:51:16.356]  And you have to have the ability, the God given ability to look at fact and data and not be deceived.
[01:51:17.057 --> 01:51:32.451]   And I am that's why I'm so blown away today was watching your last segment about the data you have compiled about The red states and what vaccine was sent where.
[01:51:32.851 --> 01:51:37.995]  This is a campaign of cruelty and death and they did it on purpose.
[01:51:38.555 --> 01:51:42.138]  They did it on purpose to, you know, just like the Nazis did.
[01:51:42.538 --> 01:51:51.105]  They study and they decided what demographic didn't suit them because that demographic doesn't buy their bullshit.
[01:51:51.425 --> 01:51:53.487]  So that demographic has to go.
[01:51:53.627 --> 01:51:55.048]  And you know who they don't like?
[01:51:55.087 --> 01:51:57.407]  They don't like people of faith.
[01:51:57.407 --> 01:52:00.047]  They really don't like us.
[01:52:00.047 --> 01:52:05.926]   And their attack right now seems to be centered on Catholics, which is really weird since
[01:52:05.926 --> 01:52:07.807]  the Vatican's part of it.
[01:52:07.807 --> 01:52:11.907]   But they don't like Catholics and they really hate Christians.
[01:52:11.907 --> 01:52:13.966]  And I know they don't like us.
[01:52:13.966 --> 01:52:17.407]  Well, they don't like some of us.
[01:52:17.407 --> 01:52:23.047]   But you know, then we have to go real deep into what the Bible says about what happened
[01:52:23.047 --> 01:52:25.887]  in Egypt, which I want to talk about too.
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:34.886]  When these people who profess themselves to be Jews, but are actually anti-Jews, I really want to talk about that too.
[01:52:35.026 --> 01:52:35.566]  You got the floor.
[01:52:35.786 --> 01:52:36.047]  Boom.
[01:52:36.107 --> 01:52:36.327]  Tell us.
[01:52:37.045 --> 01:52:50.348]  Well, when Moses was leading the children of Israel, according to Genesis, I mean Exodus, when he was taking them out, you know, God told him, don't take out this certain class of people that serve Pharaoh.
[01:52:50.688 --> 01:52:53.729]  They were the black magicians and lawyers and servants.
[01:52:53.809 --> 01:52:57.610]  They were the lawyer class, the judges and such.
[01:52:58.310 --> 01:53:04.151]  They were the servant class, as we call them, like, I guess, politicians like we have right now.
[01:53:04.671 --> 01:53:06.292]  And they were Jewish.
[01:53:07.085 --> 01:53:09.125]  The managerial class for the elite.
[01:53:09.525 --> 01:53:18.767]  Yes, and there's a name that God gave them, and it was Erev Rav, which means good teachers of bad information.
[01:53:20.027 --> 01:53:21.908]  When you break it down, that's my interpretation.
[01:53:21.928 --> 01:53:24.768]  That's what we said, they're smart, they're good teachers, but they teach bad.
[01:53:25.268 --> 01:53:26.608]  That's my interpretation.
[01:53:26.708 --> 01:53:35.290]  Good teachers of bad information, and bad information is that which leads the human beings to death.
[01:53:36.030 --> 01:53:36.350]  Right?
[01:53:36.831 --> 01:53:42.254]  Which bullshits you to go on the trains and into the showers.
[01:53:42.294 --> 01:53:43.514]  And that's what the globalists can't help.
[01:53:43.614 --> 01:53:44.675]  Everything they do hurts people.
[01:53:44.735 --> 01:53:45.676]  Everything they teach is bad.
[01:53:45.736 --> 01:53:46.696]  They know the knowledge.
[01:53:46.956 --> 01:53:47.957]  They know how to empower people.
[01:53:47.997 --> 01:53:53.280]  Why would you want to hurt people unless an alien force, Satan, wants to hurt us because we're made in the image of God?
[01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:54.300]  He's jealous of us.
[01:53:54.641 --> 01:53:55.041]  Bingo.
[01:53:57.236 --> 01:54:05.959]  But I wrote this book called Rose Anarchy and, you know, of course nobody bought it even though I went on Oprah and sucked her ass.
[01:54:06.039 --> 01:54:08.440]  It only sold 5,000 copies.
[01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:10.561]  Well, we'll sell 50,000 copies.
[01:54:10.661 --> 01:54:12.542]  Well, anyways, thanks Alex.
[01:54:12.722 --> 01:54:14.063]  I appreciate your support.
[01:54:15.143 --> 01:54:21.888]  I try really hard to, uh, I wrote that book to help deprogram kids from the Harry Potter bullshit.
[01:54:22.368 --> 01:54:24.669]  But anyway, because my grandsons was into that.
[01:54:24.729 --> 01:54:30.873]  But anyways, at the end, I wrote this chapter called The End, wherein I kill Satan.
[01:54:31.474 --> 01:54:33.095]  And I tell you how to do it.
[01:54:33.695 --> 01:54:42.636]   And I'll just give you the, at the end, how you do it is when you feel empathy, He can't be there, because he hates that.
[01:54:42.656 --> 01:54:44.137]  That's what Christ did, exactly.
[01:54:44.397 --> 01:54:46.559]  Exactly, bingo, bingo, bingo.
[01:54:46.579 --> 01:54:46.919]  Explain it.
[01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:49.301]  I'm interrupting, explain it.
[01:54:49.661 --> 01:54:50.682]  No, you explain it.
[01:54:50.702 --> 01:54:52.483]  No, I need to shut up, you're dead on.
[01:54:52.703 --> 01:54:59.088]  Because my enemies, I've learned, as soon as I just forgive them, I still oppose them, but I don't hate them, and I feel sorry for them, it deactivates them.
[01:54:59.968 --> 01:55:03.030]  That is exactly right, and that is what Christ taught.
[01:55:03.551 --> 01:55:07.914]  He taught a bunch of stuff, and I'm going to start teaching what he taught.
[01:55:08.773 --> 01:55:11.114]  Because I believe the time is right.
[01:55:11.314 --> 01:55:13.014]  And here's what I think I wanted to say.
[01:55:13.354 --> 01:55:16.755]  What I think's happening, while they put us in the quarantine, what happened?
[01:55:16.815 --> 01:55:18.295]  We got closer with our family.
[01:55:18.355 --> 01:55:19.435]  They can't defeat us.
[01:55:19.895 --> 01:55:24.816]  Everything they come up with to us, it can't work because we're connected.
[01:55:25.316 --> 01:55:28.697]  Like we go and plug our soul into the wall socket.
[01:55:28.737 --> 01:55:30.237]  They can't do nothing about it.
[01:55:30.677 --> 01:55:37.259]   Whatever they devise for us, it can't defeat us because we have souls and because we We can jack into God anytime we want.
[01:55:37.599 --> 01:55:39.000]  Anytime, and we're always there.
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:40.601]  So they cannot defeat us.
[01:55:40.621 --> 01:55:43.663]  So whatever they're going to dream up for us next, it ain't going to work.
[01:55:43.743 --> 01:55:48.887]  If they got a machine that's going to, if they got bombs, none of that's going to work because you know why?
[01:55:49.367 --> 01:55:54.850]  We are, we are praying that it all fails, that it can't work, that it's mechanical.
[01:55:54.930 --> 01:56:03.776]  Anything created by their minds and their hands for the, for the express purpose of hurting any more children on this planet, it ain't going to work.
[01:56:03.996 --> 01:56:05.557]  No weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[01:56:05.837 --> 01:56:11.961]  That is exactly right, and may it all just blink off.
[01:56:13.066 --> 01:56:17.468]  Well, they can feel that they lost before, so Satan wants to claw us down to the pit with him.
[01:56:18.108 --> 01:56:22.149]  And so that's where, I mean, we see it, and the enemy knows they've lost.
[01:56:22.189 --> 01:56:23.950]  They're trying to take as many with us as they can.
[01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:25.371]  How do we reach out?
[01:56:25.391 --> 01:56:26.511]  Because, you know, the lost sheep.
[01:56:26.791 --> 01:56:27.251]  It was great.
[01:56:27.271 --> 01:56:28.072]  A lot of folks are awake.
[01:56:28.632 --> 01:56:30.432]  I think their main job is to be waking up others.
[01:56:30.993 --> 01:56:33.934]  But when people are already turned over to evil, when do you give up?
[01:56:33.994 --> 01:56:37.595]  Like, how do you decide, I'm going to try to wake this person up, but this person's too far gone?
[01:56:38.475 --> 01:56:39.856]  Or you try to wake them all up, or what do you do?
[01:56:40.523 --> 01:56:41.584]  Here's what you gotta know.
[01:56:42.144 --> 01:56:43.485]  Where's our effin' booze?
[01:56:44.366 --> 01:56:46.027]  I got exactly what you want right here.
[01:56:47.389 --> 01:56:48.249]  How?!
[01:56:49.070 --> 01:56:51.772]  Because you said on this Jewish holiday, people are supposed to drink, right?
[01:56:51.792 --> 01:56:54.614]  Yeah, because wine... Well, I mean, if it's a religious thing, I'll do it.
[01:56:54.634 --> 01:56:56.436]  Because wine... Talk me into it.
[01:56:57.466 --> 01:57:02.928]  Because wine and alcohol is, you know, in moderation.
[01:57:02.968 --> 01:57:05.029]  Don't go all crazy calculating.
[01:57:05.049 --> 01:57:05.569]  Always in moderation.
[01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:13.933]  Because joy, lifting our spirits and joy is a great weapon against the Satan, too, because he hates joy.
[01:57:13.973 --> 01:57:16.194]  He don't even know what that is.
[01:57:16.214 --> 01:57:16.654]  F him!
[01:57:17.034 --> 01:57:17.615]  F him!
[01:57:17.975 --> 01:57:18.855]  Here's F'ing Satan!
[01:57:18.975 --> 01:57:19.656]  Go to hell, Satan!
[01:57:20.056 --> 01:57:21.756]  Yep, go back to whence you came.
[01:57:21.776 --> 01:57:25.298]  But here's what people don't know about Satan, because they've been tricked.
[01:57:26.357 --> 01:57:28.219]  Okay, they've been tricked, people.
[01:57:28.459 --> 01:57:30.640]  Now give us the esoteric Jewish secrets.
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:32.782]  I certainly am, my friend.
[01:57:32.802 --> 01:57:33.683]  All right.
[01:57:33.723 --> 01:57:34.703]  Let me get my sip.
[01:57:34.723 --> 01:57:36.865]  Yes, ma'am, take your time.
[01:57:37.966 --> 01:57:45.412]  And asking, you know, asking for connection and the right words.
[01:57:46.392 --> 01:57:46.873]  Absolutely.
[01:57:50.916 --> 01:57:52.437]  God Almighty created him.
[01:57:56.926 --> 01:58:01.990]  Don't let nobody tell you that he's as powerful as God, because he ain't, and he never will be.
[01:58:02.130 --> 01:58:07.395]  Don't let nobody give you that trick, because that's a lot of how they control you.
[01:58:07.795 --> 01:58:11.158]  You know, all these satanic cults, that's what they tell the kids.
[01:58:12.219 --> 01:58:24.077]   That Satan has got this power and that power, and he's this and that, and they'll conjure him, and he'll come after you if you ever tell And I'm going to make you do this because you're under his spell.
[01:58:24.477 --> 01:58:25.397]  That's what they do.
[01:58:25.917 --> 01:58:26.798]  That's how they do it.
[01:58:26.858 --> 01:58:27.938]  He only has the power we give him.
[01:58:29.158 --> 01:58:30.238]  Absolutely correct.
[01:58:30.258 --> 01:58:33.239]  But he does have his own power and he feeds on our fear.
[01:58:34.319 --> 01:58:35.440]  He feeds on fear.
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:41.781]  And he feeds on our hatred towards each other too.
[01:58:42.842 --> 01:58:44.302]  The hate we have for each other.
[01:58:44.822 --> 01:58:48.103]  But I'm going to straighten all this out for people.
[01:58:49.847 --> 01:59:06.231]  Um, but God did create him and what people don't know is that there is a, he has a reason to exist and that is he has his followers and his hordes, you know, they've been set loose on people and what is that for?
[01:59:06.751 --> 01:59:17.334]  Because a lot of people here, while they ain't even people, Alex, a lot of people here, they don't, what looks like people, they don't even have souls.
[01:59:18.968 --> 01:59:19.649]  You know what I mean?
[01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:20.589]  Oh, I know, I know.
[01:59:21.210 --> 01:59:32.638]  They're like apparitions that we create with what I believe, with our own evil thoughts and deeds, we create an apparition that comes at us.
[01:59:33.199 --> 01:59:40.324]  It's called a golem that we create that later turns on us because of the evil thoughts and deeds that we do.
[01:59:40.384 --> 01:59:41.825]  We created those people.
[01:59:42.125 --> 01:59:42.886]  And J.R.R.
[01:59:43.006 --> 01:59:46.228]  Tolkien, Tolkien, describes that as golem.
[01:59:46.508 --> 01:59:47.089]  Exactly.
[01:59:48.063 --> 01:59:48.643]  They're telling you.
[01:59:49.344 --> 01:59:51.486]  That's our evil side that we've allowed to operate.
[01:59:52.026 --> 01:59:53.087]  It's in us, too.
[01:59:53.147 --> 01:59:55.849]  That's what we don't ever, ever look at.
[01:59:56.710 --> 02:00:02.074]  Oh, I realize it, because when I was growing up, I was a nice young child, and then I became a teenager.
[02:00:02.094 --> 02:00:07.498]  I never got into actual devil worship, but I could definitely start dialing into that energy.
[02:00:10.603 --> 02:00:12.866]  I had a lot of power, but it was only if I was hurting people.
[02:00:13.226 --> 02:00:14.928]  I never really got all the way into it.
[02:00:14.948 --> 02:00:22.295]  I kind of halfway got into it, but I see that was God using my own free will, because if I hadn't skated on the edge of that, I wouldn't have the understanding of it.
[02:00:23.477 --> 02:00:32.286]  It's so you can master it, and so you can exercise and get it out, like it says, you know, pluck it out.
[02:00:33.283 --> 02:00:37.805]  It's so you can learn to grow your soul, because the soul can grow.
[02:00:38.405 --> 02:00:46.148]  Someone who, and here's the thing, a lot of people don't know if they have a soul, but here's how you know.
[02:00:46.728 --> 02:00:48.009]  Can you change?
[02:00:49.789 --> 02:00:53.151]  Because only someone with a soul can change.
[02:00:53.471 --> 02:00:54.131]  That is so key.
[02:00:54.491 --> 02:00:56.192]  We have free will if you have a soul.
[02:00:56.212 --> 02:00:59.173]  We're not a robot, as the left tells us, you're just a robot.
[02:00:59.673 --> 02:01:01.194]  No, we're not, because the soul can grow.
[02:01:02.347 --> 02:01:06.351]  And people who cannot change, they are messengers.
[02:01:07.333 --> 02:01:08.434]  That's the word for them.
[02:01:08.774 --> 02:01:11.497]  Another word is angels, good and bad.
[02:01:13.059 --> 02:01:18.785]  But they're here to tempt the souls to choose which side they're going to go on.
[02:01:20.953 --> 02:01:22.974]  That's one way of looking at it, you know?
[02:01:23.214 --> 02:01:26.255]  So I think at an archetypal level, we all know this is a test.
[02:01:26.795 --> 02:01:29.756]  What is your description of this dimension where we are?
[02:01:29.817 --> 02:01:30.697]  Is it a purgatory?
[02:01:30.737 --> 02:01:31.397]  Is it a test?
[02:01:31.997 --> 02:01:32.898]  How would you quantify that?
[02:01:33.278 --> 02:01:34.438]  I always say it's hell.
[02:01:35.919 --> 02:01:38.560]  This is hell where we came to pay for something we did.
[02:01:40.543 --> 02:01:51.428]  But we have the sparks of God in us, as it says, that the sparks of soul are within us, and we're supposed to set them ablaze.
[02:01:51.968 --> 02:01:54.729]  We're supposed to make a big-ass fire out of them.
[02:01:55.189 --> 02:02:00.772]  That's why our holiest day is called Lag Bomer, and it's the day of bonfires.
[02:02:01.552 --> 02:02:06.178]  Because we're supposed to take those sparks and turn them into fires and let them rage.
[02:02:06.799 --> 02:02:09.942]  Let them overcome and burn away everything bad.
[02:02:10.323 --> 02:02:18.613]  We're supposed to turn this place into heaven on earth because we do have that power and that is what I wanted to talk about today.
[02:02:19.353 --> 02:02:20.715]  We have the power.
[02:02:21.936 --> 02:02:27.420]  To make this earth heaven for every child living on it.
[02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:28.660]  We have the power.
[02:02:29.020 --> 02:02:30.001]  We have the money.
[02:02:30.421 --> 02:02:31.802]  We have the resources.
[02:02:32.102 --> 02:02:33.683]  We have the intelligence.
[02:02:33.943 --> 02:02:35.264]  We have the machinery.
[02:02:35.744 --> 02:02:36.765]  We have the hope.
[02:02:37.205 --> 02:02:40.287]  We have the desire and we have the creativity.
[02:02:40.667 --> 02:02:41.668]  We have the love.
[02:02:41.808 --> 02:02:44.249]  We have everything we need to do it.
[02:02:44.430 --> 02:02:49.833]  All we need is to turn on the switch to plug the plug into the wall.
[02:02:50.253 --> 02:02:52.275]  We've got to have the will and the free will decision.
[02:02:53.095 --> 02:02:55.257]  We just have to know we can do it.
[02:02:55.958 --> 02:02:59.581]  We just have to walk over and stick it into the wall.
[02:03:00.081 --> 02:03:02.603]  And just like, let there be light.
[02:03:02.663 --> 02:03:06.206]  When you were talking about the void, that's what created it.
[02:03:06.607 --> 02:03:12.532]  The author of everything, the creator, he said, let there be light.
[02:03:12.772 --> 02:03:14.673]  And then there was no more void.
[02:03:14.833 --> 02:03:15.434]  And it was good.
[02:03:15.854 --> 02:03:16.495]  And it was good.
[02:03:16.935 --> 02:03:22.504]  So what I would say, I agree with you, is this third dimension is a jump point to decide heaven or hell.
[02:03:22.764 --> 02:03:23.245]  That's right.
[02:03:23.265 --> 02:03:24.326]  It's heaven and it's hell.
[02:03:25.769 --> 02:03:26.329]  And you know what?
[02:03:26.450 --> 02:03:33.833]   It says that they are not an equal measure because a lot of these religious folk will say there's Well, that's Illuminati.
[02:03:33.893 --> 02:03:35.674]  Oh, the evil's part of the good and all that?
[02:03:36.194 --> 02:03:36.754]  But no.
[02:03:37.655 --> 02:03:41.176]  As physics teaches us, it's all tipped to the good.
[02:03:42.297 --> 02:03:41.176]  51%.
[02:03:43.377 --> 02:03:44.778]  It's tipped to the good.
[02:03:44.838 --> 02:03:46.598]  That's what God... Martin Luther King said that.
[02:03:46.639 --> 02:03:48.799]  He said the universe bends towards justice.
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:49.460]  It does.
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:50.340]  It does.
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:53.502]  Of course it has to because it wants to keep living.
[02:03:54.382 --> 02:03:58.924]  Anything that wants to keep living is tipped to the good, like human beings.
[02:04:00.922 --> 02:04:06.786]  So why do people... What is the trick to get people to never be conscious and join evil without knowing it?
[02:04:07.646 --> 02:04:13.590]  That seems to be the devil's trick, because when you actually pull back, God gives us prosperity and freedom and happiness and family and all these good things.
[02:04:14.070 --> 02:04:17.192]  Everything evil gives us is destructive and is worthless.
[02:04:17.292 --> 02:04:18.293]  Why would you even join it?
[02:04:21.495 --> 02:04:24.637]  People think they have free will, but they don't.
[02:04:25.458 --> 02:04:25.998]  Really.
[02:04:26.138 --> 02:04:29.060]  You can only order what's on the menu, Alex.
[02:04:31.906 --> 02:04:34.307]  That's almost like a Calvinistic view, like predestination.
[02:04:35.127 --> 02:04:37.288]  Yeah, you can only get what's on the menu.
[02:04:37.588 --> 02:04:40.930]  When you think, you can only get what's on the menu, I guess.
[02:04:42.250 --> 02:04:43.311]  So why did God do that?
[02:04:43.371 --> 02:04:45.992]  Because people from particular families tend to go certain ways.
[02:04:46.492 --> 02:04:48.293]  People from evil families tend to go the other way.
[02:04:48.333 --> 02:04:55.156]  Sometimes there's different things, but it does seem like you have free will, but it's kind of pre-baked into the cake.
[02:04:55.296 --> 02:04:58.057]  There's free will, but it's kind of determined then.
[02:04:58.357 --> 02:05:00.178]  It's like, okay, you're free will, but you're going to do this.
[02:05:01.676 --> 02:05:03.978]  No, you just get what's on the menu.
[02:05:04.278 --> 02:05:05.159]  You can choose.
[02:05:05.839 --> 02:05:12.384]  Like it says that we have ten realities that, you know, our holy books say we have ten realities that we can choose.
[02:05:12.784 --> 02:05:17.568]  Like you go into a multiplex theater and there's ten movies playing.
[02:05:18.308 --> 02:05:23.112]  You can decide which, you can use your free will to decide which movie you're going to go see.
[02:05:24.232 --> 02:05:24.913]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:05:24.933 --> 02:05:25.673]  Choose your own adventure.
[02:05:25.914 --> 02:05:27.835]  Yeah, but God made all them movies.
[02:05:29.211 --> 02:05:31.852]  You aren't going to choose one that He didn't author.
[02:05:31.872 --> 02:05:34.192]  I mean, I totally agree.
[02:05:34.252 --> 02:05:35.533]  It all works towards God's plan.
[02:05:35.833 --> 02:05:36.613]  Yeah, all of it.
[02:05:37.593 --> 02:05:53.718]  Even when we think it's not, I think that we were put here to grow and to learn and to develop our skills to be God-like because He, of course, wants us to be infinite beings.
[02:05:54.637 --> 02:05:58.360]  I don't believe that he put us here just to die and shrivel up.
[02:05:58.981 --> 02:06:06.387]  I think he wants us to figure out how we can live forever, and I do believe science is on the verge of that now.
[02:06:06.968 --> 02:06:08.409]  That we would be immortal.
[02:06:09.550 --> 02:06:16.396]  Which, that is just a reflection of how powerful we are, that we can physically pull things together in the third dimension, when it's already been done in the higher dimensions.
[02:06:16.909 --> 02:06:24.496]  Yeah, and then we can, as Bill Hicks said, travel and study space together for all time and forever.
[02:06:24.957 --> 02:06:30.202]  We are so beyond this little planet that we're about to ruin, it seems.
[02:06:30.723 --> 02:06:37.749]  But we could, in the blink of an eye, change all that just by deciding to change it.
[02:06:38.430 --> 02:06:39.371]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:06:39.451 --> 02:06:40.372]  We have the power.
[02:06:40.854 --> 02:06:46.657]  To change everything with a decision to not do it anymore.
[02:06:47.278 --> 02:06:51.540]  To not hold up those structures of Babylon anymore.
[02:06:51.580 --> 02:06:52.701]  Just to let them fall.
[02:06:53.261 --> 02:06:54.682]  I mean, just to let them fall.
[02:06:54.742 --> 02:06:59.705]  You know, I ran for president in 2012 and I found out because I wanted to find out how it works, you know?
[02:07:00.165 --> 02:07:10.011]  And I did find out that if less than 30% of the people vote, and I'm not advocating this, but then they have to call it not an election.
[02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:13.270]  But they never tell us that.
[02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:18.090]   Well let me ask you a big picture, which is really the little picture, kind of the five
[02:07:18.090 --> 02:07:20.831]  foot view, so the 30,000 foot view.
[02:07:20.831 --> 02:07:27.630]   What do you expect with Ukraine, with Biden, with Trump, just where the world is right
[02:07:27.839 --> 02:07:30.681]  Because the world is waking up, but are they waking up fast enough?
[02:07:30.861 --> 02:07:34.805]  And gut level, Roseanne, what do you expect is going to unfold now?
[02:07:34.825 --> 02:07:36.186]  This is such an exciting time.
[02:07:36.626 --> 02:07:38.588]  Anybody that says they're bored is crazy.
[02:07:38.768 --> 02:07:39.729]  Yeah, they're crazy.
[02:07:39.849 --> 02:07:45.695]  And anybody who says I'm not into politics, well, politics is into you, so you better wake up.
[02:07:48.906 --> 02:07:50.207]  It could go one of two ways.
[02:07:50.347 --> 02:08:08.839]  It could go that, you know, they're they're so backed against the wall and they're so afraid that their stuff is going to be exposed because it's I think everything is about not exposing what we already all know, but they don't want the regular people to know what we know.
[02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:10.320]  So who knows?
[02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:11.621]  They might use a bomb.
[02:08:11.741 --> 02:08:12.962]  I don't know what they're going to do.
[02:08:13.162 --> 02:08:15.504]  I mean, look what they did in Ohio.
[02:08:15.904 --> 02:08:16.925]  That's our Chernobyl.
[02:08:17.606 --> 02:08:18.967]  I don't know what they're going to do.
[02:08:19.247 --> 02:08:20.248]  They could do anything.
[02:08:20.428 --> 02:08:23.991]  They certainly don't care about any of us.
[02:08:24.632 --> 02:08:25.753]  I mean, any of them.
[02:08:26.794 --> 02:08:30.036]  And so I don't know what they could do.
[02:08:30.257 --> 02:08:38.163]  But I do know that we have a 1% chance of winning.
[02:08:38.904 --> 02:08:41.266]  And I know that that's all we need.
[02:08:41.846 --> 02:08:42.767]  That's all we need.
[02:08:44.388 --> 02:08:45.349]  We have each other.
[02:08:47.130 --> 02:08:48.071]  That's all we need.
[02:08:48.811 --> 02:08:56.276]  And I was going to say how they always talk about love, love, love this, and a lot of people don't even know what love means, but a lot of people have hate.
[02:08:56.936 --> 02:09:00.098]  And in my book, I talked about the power of hate.
[02:09:01.587 --> 02:09:04.248]  And I always had a lot of hate.
[02:09:04.288 --> 02:09:12.072]  You was talking, you did too Alex, but I had this one teacher and he took me in his house and he said he he used to be a hateful person too.
[02:09:12.472 --> 02:09:33.139]   He was my rabbi and he had this dog and he didn't like his wife's dog and we were eating steak and he cut the heart out of the steak and He called the dog over, he gave it to the dog, and he said, he said, every dog, he said, is the reincarnation of a bad rabbi.
[02:09:33.159 --> 02:09:35.581]  And he said, I know who that dog is.
[02:09:35.881 --> 02:09:39.704]  That dog used to be a rabbi that turned me in.
[02:09:39.724 --> 02:09:45.710]  And when I give him the heart of the stake, it kills him because I'm so kind.
[02:09:48.377 --> 02:09:54.740]  And he said, we all have only one enemy and none of it is each other.
[02:09:55.861 --> 02:09:59.503]  We only have one enemy and that is the one below.
[02:10:00.623 --> 02:10:07.287]  The evil one, the trickster, the snake, that guy.
[02:10:08.027 --> 02:10:09.888]  That's the only enemy we have.
[02:10:10.028 --> 02:10:20.274]   And if we would harness all that hate that we've used on each other, If we would take it away from each other and harness it on evil...
[02:10:22.096 --> 02:10:25.358]  We could destroy evil in the blink of an eye.
[02:10:25.919 --> 02:10:38.909]  All that hate we have for the abusers who put us in jail when we were innocent, who've harmed our children, who've tortured us, who've stolen from us, who've killed our family.
[02:10:39.289 --> 02:10:46.114]  All of that hate that we feel and are supposed to, you know, drink ourselves to death or drug ourselves to death.
[02:10:46.654 --> 02:11:25.429]   To deny that we have because we're so loving which is all BS if we would focus that on hating evil and what is done to the children of this world by those people who enslave and murder them every day by the thousands and in vampiric satanic acts actually extract And drink their blood as they all like talk about right in front of our faces, but we don't hear it because we think it's a fantasy, but it's not a fantasy.
[02:11:27.020 --> 02:11:33.965]  If we would hate that evil with all the hate we have in us, it would go away and we could stop it.
[02:11:34.345 --> 02:11:37.688]  And that's what we're here to do is to stop that.
[02:11:38.268 --> 02:11:55.020]  And I want you all to like just know that we have the power to stop everything horrible on this planet if we just hate it enough and love God and each other enough to figure that out.
[02:11:55.822 --> 02:11:56.942]  And I pray we do.
[02:11:57.203 --> 02:11:59.183]  That reminds me of the Alexander Schultz edition quote.
[02:11:59.203 --> 02:12:00.424]  Maybe the crew can print it for me.
[02:12:01.004 --> 02:12:02.105]  Oh, how we burned in the camps.
[02:12:02.285 --> 02:12:03.285]  Print it off for me and bring it to me.
[02:12:03.305 --> 02:12:10.228]  It's a full quote, but he said, if we just would have cared enough and done something early on, we could have stopped it.
[02:12:10.308 --> 02:12:14.629]  And for somebody that, you know, your grandmother, I'm a father, I've got four children.
[02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:17.170]  I love my children so much.
[02:12:17.310 --> 02:12:19.011]  And I love my five and a half year old daughter.
[02:12:19.031 --> 02:12:20.732]  Well, we can have more, but we probably can't.
[02:12:21.659 --> 02:12:23.459]  So much, I would die for her immediately.
[02:12:23.639 --> 02:12:24.520]  I can see God in her.
[02:12:24.540 --> 02:12:26.240]  I can see the innocence, the purity, the goodness.
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:31.501]  I think about almost guilty, like I have this child in this evil world, but that's God creating us as well.
[02:12:31.541 --> 02:12:33.021]  God gives us examples of what God did.
[02:12:33.441 --> 02:12:34.241]  You have free will.
[02:12:34.321 --> 02:12:35.221]  God made my daughter.
[02:12:35.281 --> 02:12:38.462]  God made my son, made my other daughters, who I love so much.
[02:12:39.162 --> 02:12:47.623]  And it makes you then put skin in the game and say, because I love my family so much, because I love so much, I need to recognize evil.
[02:12:47.683 --> 02:12:50.764]  I need to reject it and say no to it and absolutely defeat it.
[02:12:51.825 --> 02:12:53.106]  That's what we're here for.
[02:12:53.667 --> 02:12:58.851]  And by doing that, we will create heaven on earth, as we were put here to do.
[02:12:58.891 --> 02:13:00.152]  That's what we were put here to do.
[02:13:00.172 --> 02:13:03.455]  Because we're individuals, but we're also a collective in our will.
[02:13:03.815 --> 02:13:05.757]  So nobody's going to be commanded by government.
[02:13:05.797 --> 02:13:06.918]  Nobody's going to be monitored.
[02:13:07.418 --> 02:13:10.060]  We will just recognize evil and won't allow it to happen.
[02:13:10.621 --> 02:13:11.041]  That's right.
[02:13:11.101 --> 02:13:21.769]   And I wanted to say that the real reason Satan was invented is because in the upper court of God, Guess who the prosecuting attorney turns out to be, Alex?
[02:13:22.370 --> 02:13:22.550]  Who?
[02:13:23.010 --> 02:13:23.471]  Satan.
[02:13:25.072 --> 02:13:27.413]  He goes to God and says, I need, these are bad, see?
[02:13:27.453 --> 02:13:28.314]  Let me go after them.
[02:13:28.594 --> 02:13:33.497]  That's why he wants us to do sins and create wicked dominions because he can only operate where he's got that going on.
[02:13:33.797 --> 02:13:40.562]  And then he brings us before the court of heaven and says, here were their sins and here's what I got them to do.
[02:13:40.922 --> 02:13:43.664]  So in effect, you don't get away with nothing.
[02:13:43.684 --> 02:13:47.166]  That's what's crazy is Satan is described as the prosecutor.
[02:13:47.446 --> 02:13:48.807]  That's right, he is the prosecutor.
[02:13:48.827 --> 02:13:49.527]  He's the accuser.
[02:13:49.847 --> 02:13:53.109]  He's the accuser and the prosecutor in the upper court.
[02:13:53.189 --> 02:14:00.972]  So, what that message says is, you also will be judged for what you allow and for what you're blind to.
[02:14:01.032 --> 02:14:03.833]  You also will be judged for what you allowed.
[02:14:04.393 --> 02:14:05.754]  I want people to know that.
[02:14:06.134 --> 02:14:09.956]  Because what you turned your blind eye to, you're going to be judged for that too.
[02:14:10.583 --> 02:14:29.132]  Tucker Carlson said this Friday, where are the big Christian churches, when we play the clip in a moment, where are the Christian churches when in the U.S., Canada, Europe, everywhere, they are arresting preachers that peacefully protest abortion clinics and peacefully protest drag queen pedophile time, and they are arresting them.
[02:14:29.592 --> 02:14:31.513]  Where is Joel Osteen?
[02:14:32.093 --> 02:14:33.514]  Where are they?
[02:14:34.054 --> 02:14:37.436]  Even if you're not a Christian, we should support their free speech.
[02:14:39.784 --> 02:14:43.166]  Well, I think that is what Jesus said, ain't it?
[02:14:43.726 --> 02:14:44.366]  To the Pharisees.
[02:14:44.386 --> 02:14:45.527]  He said, you're not really doing anything.
[02:14:45.767 --> 02:14:47.668]  Yeah, I think that's what he said.
[02:14:47.688 --> 02:14:48.248]  And they got mad.
[02:14:48.268 --> 02:14:50.209]  They said, why are you hanging around with tax collectors and prostitutes?
[02:14:50.230 --> 02:14:51.610]  He said, that's where the people need help.
[02:14:52.591 --> 02:14:55.712]  You're too high and mighty to even meet with these people.
[02:14:56.573 --> 02:15:06.418]  And he also took people up to a mountain and he said, hey, I'm going to feed 2000 people with, you know, just a little bit of fish and a little bit of wine.
[02:15:06.578 --> 02:15:07.458]  Remember that one?
[02:15:08.119 --> 02:15:08.299]  Yes.
[02:15:09.485 --> 02:15:10.285]  And what did he say?
[02:15:10.325 --> 02:15:16.067]  He was teaching people about metaphysics and common will.
[02:15:17.168 --> 02:15:29.932]  The will of the people united can change everything, including, I know this will get me in trouble, but I believe it, including matter itself.
[02:15:31.192 --> 02:15:50.425]   Well they know in quantum mechanics, For 100 years, 120, 150 years of Max Planck, but now they've got the big spectrometers and things, and they know that just a human observing something, when the microscopes are observing, they can't catch it.
[02:15:50.445 --> 02:15:53.627]  As soon as you turn it off, the particle slips across the time-space barrier.
[02:15:54.128 --> 02:15:55.589]  It can't be seen.
[02:15:55.689 --> 02:15:56.729]  It's not allowed to be seen.
[02:15:57.310 --> 02:15:58.250]  That's power.
[02:15:58.530 --> 02:16:05.955]  And the scientists who weren't even religious or spiritual, they go, whoa, something else is in control, because they're seeing it for themselves.
[02:16:06.263 --> 02:16:08.525]  Yeah, because consciousness affects matter.
[02:16:09.586 --> 02:16:11.067]  It absolutely does.
[02:16:11.487 --> 02:16:20.795]  So that's why I was thinking if we all put our heads together and like the will of the people united equals the work of God.
[02:16:21.155 --> 02:16:28.702]  And that's what the system fears is the will to wake up, the will to build a better world, the will to say we can have all the resources we need, which we've got.
[02:16:29.162 --> 02:16:32.661]   They've already photographed Trillions of galaxies now?
[02:16:33.462 --> 02:16:36.964]  With hundreds of millions of stars and planets per galaxy?
[02:16:37.024 --> 02:16:39.987]  I mean, folks, there's not... We're at an embryonic level.
[02:16:40.027 --> 02:16:41.088]  We're about to do something big.
[02:16:41.148 --> 02:16:46.051]  And there's a force that knows that, that is the tester, that is allowed, because that's free will.
[02:16:47.052 --> 02:16:49.634]  Doesn't mean God likes it, but God has to give us free will.
[02:16:50.054 --> 02:16:51.175]  And that's kind of the boot camp.
[02:16:51.235 --> 02:16:52.756]  And some make it through boot camp, some don't.
[02:16:53.417 --> 02:16:58.040]  Yeah, because after free will, you know, after free will, there's something else.
[02:16:58.301 --> 02:16:59.942]  That's called invention.
[02:17:02.873 --> 02:17:03.273]  Exactly.
[02:17:03.293 --> 02:17:04.014]  Innovation.
[02:17:04.094 --> 02:17:05.635]  Creativity.
[02:17:05.775 --> 02:17:07.036]  True creativity.
[02:17:07.276 --> 02:17:08.917]  God, we're made in the image of the Creator.
[02:17:09.258 --> 02:17:09.458]  Yeah.
[02:17:09.538 --> 02:17:10.959]  We create, and look what we've done.
[02:17:11.199 --> 02:17:14.201]  We envisioned spaceships on the moon 150 years ago.
[02:17:14.241 --> 02:17:14.621]  They're there.
[02:17:15.422 --> 02:17:19.905]  Max Planck envisioned 160, 130 years ago, atomic bombs in his mind.
[02:17:19.965 --> 02:17:20.445]  It was real.
[02:17:21.206 --> 02:17:22.107]  That's power.
[02:17:23.427 --> 02:17:33.678]   Our power is We could fix every single problem on earth if we just see it.
[02:17:33.938 --> 02:17:40.942]  When was the last time anybody, I always ask people, can you see, can you envision a perfect society?
[02:17:41.082 --> 02:17:42.343]  And nobody ever can.
[02:17:42.363 --> 02:17:47.946]  Because they haven't even thought to do, it hasn't even occurred to them to think to do it.
[02:17:48.307 --> 02:17:51.008]  But of course it can't exist until we see it.
[02:17:51.508 --> 02:17:55.271]  It can't exist until we see it and talk about it, think about it.
[02:17:55.690 --> 02:17:58.170]  You know, even think about it.
[02:17:58.170 --> 02:18:02.730]   And the perfect society is interfacing with God, with competition and ideas and openness.
[02:18:02.730 --> 02:18:06.730]   And the most intelligent and powerful become the leaders, but they scoop up those of the
[02:18:06.730 --> 02:18:10.090]   lowest and empower them, and it just makes it all so much stronger.
[02:18:10.090 --> 02:18:15.209]   Yeah, because that's why I moved to Hawaii, because I had in my mind this vision of a
[02:18:15.209 --> 02:18:21.770]   perfect society where everybody ate, everybody grew stuff in common.
[02:18:21.941 --> 02:18:25.483]  Food, because food is what's going to be scarce next.
[02:18:25.923 --> 02:18:27.124]  That's the next trick.
[02:18:27.144 --> 02:18:30.066]  Well, Thomas Jefferson said, farmers are the basis of any civilization.
[02:18:30.726 --> 02:18:34.888]  And I farm in Hawaii, organic farming, and we fought with Monsanto.
[02:18:35.949 --> 02:18:44.394]  That's why I ended up running for president, because in 2012, I helped to chase Monsanto's ass off the big island of Hawaii.
[02:18:44.974 --> 02:18:45.855]  And they were gone.
[02:18:46.893 --> 02:18:47.274]  No, not.
[02:18:47.454 --> 02:18:47.955]  Yeah, COTA.
[02:18:48.275 --> 02:18:48.435]  Yeah.
[02:18:48.515 --> 02:18:48.956]  Great job.
[02:18:49.196 --> 02:18:49.376]  Yeah.
[02:18:49.937 --> 02:18:52.239]  And, uh, you know, for organic farming.
[02:18:52.259 --> 02:18:55.963]  People who don't know that I'm in a helicopter, that is a big, giant farm.
[02:18:59.167 --> 02:18:59.447]  Yeah.
[02:18:59.928 --> 02:19:05.053]  And I grow pineapples, citrus, and I got like 2000 mackinac trees.
[02:19:05.233 --> 02:19:11.179]  And I'm glad to talk about this, too, because the macadamia nut is a gift of God.
[02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:15.084]  And I believe that might have been what manna was in the desert.
[02:19:15.884 --> 02:19:16.805]  I have it in my mind.
[02:19:16.845 --> 02:19:27.775]   It could have been because it was like That nut is the perfect protein that it has the exact amount of fats and protein to nourish the brain.
[02:19:28.516 --> 02:19:35.485]  And I have it all over the ground in Hawaii because it costs too much to shell it twice.
[02:19:35.844 --> 02:19:38.844]  And then, you know, that's why they're so expensive.
[02:19:38.844 --> 02:19:44.644]   But this is the most perfect food for the human being that, you know, I believe it's
[02:19:44.644 --> 02:19:49.125]   just the perfect food that could solve world hunger right now if they figure out a way
[02:19:49.125 --> 02:19:50.125]  to do it.
[02:19:50.125 --> 02:19:51.125]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:19:51.125 --> 02:19:54.284]   The globalists are openly creating as many problems as they can because they're scared
[02:19:54.284 --> 02:19:56.084]  of this jump point we're about to achieve.
[02:19:56.084 --> 02:20:00.484]   We'll have free energy, unlimited power, unlimited life, even the third dimension.
[02:20:00.788 --> 02:20:06.692]  God's given us so much power that our soul is eternal, but now it's about to be eternal even in this third dimension.
[02:20:06.732 --> 02:20:12.956]  That's the reflection of that eternity is so powerful, it's about to create immortality here now.
[02:20:13.796 --> 02:20:16.538]  That's the higher dimensions invading the lower dimensions.
[02:20:16.798 --> 02:20:29.892]  I'm seeing the 5th Dimension, which my friend wrote a book, Mary Daly, called Quintessence, about the 5th Dimension, where everything is telepathic and we're connectors to the past, the present, and the future, which we are anyway.
[02:20:29.932 --> 02:20:30.873]  We're wired for that.
[02:20:31.394 --> 02:20:37.340]  All at the same time, but we don't really notice it, because we have all these minds, all these walls.
[02:20:37.479 --> 02:20:42.039]   in our mind due to mind control and mass media and all these other distractions.
[02:20:42.039 --> 02:20:45.600]   But we do have the power to go into the past and see the future
[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:50.600]   and be in the now at the exact same time and we do it every day anyway but we don't
[02:20:50.600 --> 02:20:55.359]   Well let me tell you, it hasn't happened a lot in my life but I've had it happen ten times or so where I have an
[02:20:55.359 --> 02:20:59.079]   exact dream it can be the most simple thing but it can also be a very
[02:20:59.079 --> 02:21:02.079]   usually traumatic thing that comes true months or years later.
[02:21:02.124 --> 02:21:06.930]  I haven't even written down the stuff that happens exactly as I saw, so that's going into the future.
[02:21:07.090 --> 02:21:11.856]  And really, that's what the system fears, is that we have that capacity.
[02:21:11.876 --> 02:21:15.881]  And once you transcend and realize how powerful you are through God, you don't need them anymore.
[02:21:16.377 --> 02:21:38.647]  Well, the fifth dimension is where all of that stuff comes into play and how we can trigger ourselves into the fifth dimension, which I think we are in the doorway of, is by just imagining, I love the word imaging, imagining what it looks like to live in a perfect neighborhood or perfect, let's start with family.
[02:21:38.967 --> 02:21:43.149]   What does it look like to live in a perfect Neighborhood.
[02:21:43.489 --> 02:21:48.732]  What does it look like to live in a perfect community that works for all the people, where all the kids are safe?
[02:21:49.292 --> 02:21:50.933]  And I think about that all the time.
[02:21:50.993 --> 02:22:00.738]  So in Hawaii, it's a bunch of farms in common, and everybody grows the things that are needed for the community.
[02:22:01.741 --> 02:22:13.164]  And it works really well and I think it's a model and I think everybody should start thinking about that now because they are trying to manipulate our food.
[02:22:13.604 --> 02:22:15.784]  That's the next big thing and our water.
[02:22:16.124 --> 02:22:22.486]  So everybody should be looking into like how to get your community-based food and water.
[02:22:22.846 --> 02:22:34.218]   That's living with your neighbor and reaching out to them and working You know, together to make that happen without the government giving you anything, but doing the work yourselves.
[02:22:34.438 --> 02:22:36.659]  And again, that sounds over-simplistic, but it's not.
[02:22:37.059 --> 02:22:40.101]  The whole system is about making us dependent on them.
[02:22:41.261 --> 02:22:43.202]  Yeah, taking away our free will.
[02:22:44.303 --> 02:22:49.566]  Taking away any sort of free will, free thought, any kind of individuality.
[02:22:49.926 --> 02:22:52.027]  They don't want us to help each other either.
[02:22:53.868 --> 02:22:55.869]  They don't want us to educate each other.
[02:22:56.906 --> 02:23:01.148]  They don't want us to lift each other, they just want us all to fight, fight, fight and hate.
[02:23:03.709 --> 02:23:04.910]  How is it going for the New World Order?
[02:23:06.130 --> 02:23:09.351]  Well, they're over and they know they're over and they're desperate.
[02:23:09.412 --> 02:23:10.552]  Look how desperate they are.
[02:23:10.992 --> 02:23:20.975]   Would it come to a point where they're actually thinking about pushing Putin to You know, surrounding Putin on every single side.
[02:23:21.656 --> 02:23:22.956]  Look what they're doing over there.
[02:23:22.976 --> 02:23:24.017]  Look what we're doing.
[02:23:24.237 --> 02:23:25.137]  We're doing it.
[02:23:25.337 --> 02:23:27.518]  And again, it's because Russia is weak.
[02:23:28.058 --> 02:23:30.019]  I'm not saying Russians are weak themselves.
[02:23:30.039 --> 02:23:33.681]  I'm saying they're the smallest power of the three blocks.
[02:23:33.701 --> 02:23:34.341]  The U.S.
[02:23:34.361 --> 02:23:37.662]  globalist thing, the JCOMS ally, but that covertly.
[02:23:38.343 --> 02:23:45.729]   And Russia has this great landmass and all this, but they are They are weak compared to the globalists, and I think that's why they've chosen them.
[02:23:45.749 --> 02:23:48.893]  But at the end of the day, now they're forcing the Russians to fight.
[02:23:49.614 --> 02:23:50.575]  Where do you see this going?
[02:23:51.256 --> 02:23:55.101]  Well, you know, my family is from the Ukraine and from Russia.
[02:23:56.093 --> 02:24:04.498]  And I know that every single fight, that's why I'm talking to people today, every single fight is won through heart and will.
[02:24:04.958 --> 02:24:06.819]  You know, it's decided at that point.
[02:24:06.939 --> 02:24:07.680]  You know that.
[02:24:08.240 --> 02:24:09.441]  That's Machiavellian.
[02:24:09.601 --> 02:24:12.403]  It's decided at the point of will and heart.
[02:24:13.123 --> 02:24:16.905]  And so you can't take that away from the Russians.
[02:24:17.405 --> 02:24:22.128]  And I like how he said, well, go ahead anyway, because what is a world without Russia?
[02:24:22.568 --> 02:24:24.990]  And I mean, what is a world without Russia?
[02:24:26.539 --> 02:24:28.260]  So what are your gut level things about to happen?
[02:24:30.061 --> 02:24:35.565]  I think what's about to happen is because we prayed here today, all that shit's going to break down.
[02:24:35.645 --> 02:24:38.967]  And I think that nothing's going to happen.
[02:24:39.167 --> 02:24:40.788]  I think they're all going to get caught.
[02:24:41.008 --> 02:24:44.991]  I think that the whole Epstein thing is going to be exposed.
[02:24:45.491 --> 02:24:50.834]  I think that intelligence and the people and all the research they're doing is going to pay off.
[02:24:51.255 --> 02:24:59.130]   I think every one of them, as my friend said about 20 years ago, The children will speak the names of their abusers in public.
[02:24:59.611 --> 02:25:11.040]  I think it will crumble everything and these... So just like the communists and the Nazis, this tyranny seems invincible, it seems arrogant, it seems like it can't be stopped, but they act arrogant and all-powerful.
[02:25:11.060 --> 02:25:16.925]  You will eat bugs, you'll have nothing, to make us think, well they're so evil they're out in the open, they're doing that to make us think we're weak.
[02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:20.431]  They're doing it, yeah, to make us think we're helpless.
[02:25:20.491 --> 02:25:25.913]  But, you know, like I said, they don't know anything about the human spirit or the soul of God.
[02:25:25.933 --> 02:25:27.393]  Which shows how they're not human.
[02:25:27.733 --> 02:25:29.514]  You know, I saw an article... I don't believe that.
[02:25:29.594 --> 02:25:31.015]  I don't think they're human either.
[02:25:31.255 --> 02:25:31.675]  Exactly.
[02:25:31.695 --> 02:25:32.235]  It's like an avatar.
[02:25:32.255 --> 02:25:33.335]  I think they're messengers.
[02:25:33.515 --> 02:25:34.776]  They've turned their bodies over.
[02:25:34.836 --> 02:25:36.136]  They're negative angels.
[02:25:36.376 --> 02:25:40.778]  And they're like, they're putting fear into us because Satan feeds on fear.
[02:25:41.601 --> 02:25:47.865]  Well, I saw a New York Times article last week where they went, oh, we've done major polls in Russia and secret studies and talked about it.
[02:25:48.486 --> 02:25:50.487]  The more we kill Russians, the more they fight.
[02:25:51.127 --> 02:25:56.911]  Well, when Hitler started bombing London and civilian targets, it made the British go from being anti-war to pro-war.
[02:25:58.112 --> 02:26:00.993]  That's, like, you walk up and punch me in the face, you're gonna get a fight.
[02:26:01.293 --> 02:26:11.415]  I mean, how did they not know that starting a war nine years ago in Ukraine and then launching it and getting Putin to come in, how did they not know that, oh, the Russians are losing, now they're really ready to go to war?
[02:26:11.475 --> 02:26:13.955]  Like, how do you not know human nature?
[02:26:14.195 --> 02:26:15.176]  It's like, it's not human.
[02:26:15.416 --> 02:26:21.757]  I can tell you right now, I said it a year ago when it started, I said they're gonna beat the Russians up front, the Russians are gonna double down, it's gonna escalate.
[02:26:22.657 --> 02:26:26.818]  Well, they want an escalation because that's part of depopulation.
[02:26:26.918 --> 02:26:31.800]  Also, war is a great cover for stealing kids.
[02:26:31.940 --> 02:26:34.760]  Everything is about that.
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.161]  I called it the pedo-ponzi pyramid.
[02:26:37.181 --> 02:26:38.121]  Talk about it.
[02:26:38.161 --> 02:26:48.264]  Their currency is innocence of children, because children are connected to God, and if they can torture a child, that pisses God off and sticks a knife in God's leg.
[02:26:49.067 --> 02:26:53.125]  And that's what it is, is they want to torture God, and that's why they want to hurt children.
[02:26:53.185 --> 02:26:53.647]  Is that correct?
[02:26:55.270 --> 02:26:56.391]  They hate life.
[02:26:56.491 --> 02:26:57.711]  They're necrophilic.
[02:26:58.772 --> 02:27:00.273]  We are biophilic.
[02:27:00.373 --> 02:27:01.293]  We love life.
[02:27:01.433 --> 02:27:02.334]  And that's the difference.
[02:27:02.694 --> 02:27:03.875]  You can call it good or evil.
[02:27:03.915 --> 02:27:05.255]  You can call it God or Satan.
[02:27:05.295 --> 02:27:06.896]  But are you pro-life or pro-death?
[02:27:06.936 --> 02:27:07.336]  Exactly.
[02:27:07.557 --> 02:27:08.157]  Exactly.
[02:27:08.697 --> 02:27:23.185]  And that's funny, because look at how they say, like I said, oh, I went from domestic goddess to domestic terrorist, I guess, because I've never been somebody who's for killing.
[02:27:23.652 --> 02:27:25.535]  Kids in the womb or out, you know?
[02:27:26.396 --> 02:27:26.876]  It's funny.
[02:27:27.157 --> 02:27:28.298]  Well, let's talk about that.
[02:27:28.318 --> 02:27:29.760]  I don't want to interrupt you.
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.002]  That's all it's about.
[02:27:31.062 --> 02:27:32.964]  It's a pedo-ponzi scheme.
[02:27:33.685 --> 02:27:37.170]  A pedo-ponzi scheme.
[02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:39.353]  Yeah, currency is children.
[02:27:39.798 --> 02:27:40.939]  I want you to elaborate on that.
[02:27:40.959 --> 02:27:48.446]  I'm not trying to get you in trouble again, but you went on Joe Rogan like four years ago when you got deplatformed along with me, and I have the 60 Minutes clip.
[02:27:48.486 --> 02:27:49.107]  Guys, queue it up.
[02:27:49.147 --> 02:27:52.930]  If she doesn't say it, it's fine, because taking on Soros is a big deal, but she has a lot of courage.
[02:27:53.551 --> 02:28:03.240]  Soros went on 60 Minutes, he went on NPR, and he said, best part of my life was working for Hitler, and I don't have any guilt for myself because I was just filling a slot.
[02:28:03.540 --> 02:28:07.906]   Well, that's like saying I mean, he put a gun to my head and said, go kill people or I'm going to kill you.
[02:28:07.946 --> 02:28:09.468]  I'm going to say, pull the freaking trigger, dude.
[02:28:09.828 --> 02:28:14.454]  But the point is that idea of like, I give up responsibility because somebody else told me to do it.
[02:28:14.795 --> 02:28:17.458]  Well, that's like the Nazis following orders because Hitler told him to.
[02:28:17.799 --> 02:28:19.922]  That doesn't float the boat at Nuremberg.
[02:28:19.962 --> 02:28:20.903]  Their asses got hung.
[02:28:21.711 --> 02:28:27.630]   And rightfully so. And so I have this weird paradox where I don't live off them, but I have pride over it.
[02:28:27.630 --> 02:28:32.752]   Both my grandfathers were in the Army Air Corps. One was a hero, ran a bunch of missions. One only
[02:28:32.752 --> 02:28:38.832]   did a few, got his plane got damaged, crash landed, broke a bunch of bones, and you know, barely lived.
[02:28:38.832 --> 02:28:42.832]   But one of them was, you know, they were both great guys, but one of them was a real war hero.
[02:28:43.047 --> 02:28:44.668]  North Africa, Italy, Germany.
[02:28:45.028 --> 02:28:46.528]  Volunteered mission after mission.
[02:28:46.989 --> 02:28:48.109]  You know, all of it.
[02:28:48.589 --> 02:28:55.352]  And didn't have the media call me a Nazi when I almost don't exist, because both my grandfathers almost died in World War II.
[02:28:55.652 --> 02:28:58.293]  And then to see him saying, it was happy making time.
[02:28:58.613 --> 02:29:00.574]  It was the best time of my life.
[02:29:00.594 --> 02:29:04.476]  I have no guilt though, because I was just filling a slot, kind of like the market.
[02:29:05.556 --> 02:29:06.517]  Like you're a robot.
[02:29:06.557 --> 02:29:09.278]  Like, Hitler was in charge, so I did what he said.
[02:29:10.231 --> 02:29:14.474]  And then literally, I get to be called a Nazi by the ADL when I have nothing to do with this?
[02:29:15.175 --> 02:29:20.039]  It makes me angry that this is going on, and it disgusts me.
[02:29:20.079 --> 02:29:25.483]  And then you got deplatformed for daring to say George Soros said he worked for Hitler.
[02:29:25.843 --> 02:29:28.785]  George Soros said that on 60 Minutes.
[02:29:29.246 --> 02:29:34.470]  So I guess the bigger question is, why did he say it, and then why aren't you allowed to say he said it?
[02:29:35.578 --> 02:29:47.120]  Well, he said that he was 14 years old, so what I said was, well, you know, you can't hold a 14-year-old slave responsible for what the slave master does.
[02:29:47.201 --> 02:29:56.002]  But I said, okay, so we won't talk about that, but we will talk about everything you did as an adult, which was just as bad, if not worse.
[02:29:56.042 --> 02:30:02.824]  You collapsed whole societies, which led to, you know, death of people all over the planet.
[02:30:03.584 --> 02:30:08.746]  When you financially collapse an entire nation, that that leads to a lot of death.
[02:30:09.206 --> 02:30:11.167]  And you do it to make money.
[02:30:11.427 --> 02:30:15.708]  That's, you know, you did that as an adult and not as a Nazi slave.
[02:30:15.728 --> 02:30:18.529]  So let's just talk about what you did after.
[02:30:19.974 --> 02:30:25.815]  Because what he did after, you know, he didn't have, well, he still has, he still has puppet masters.
[02:30:25.835 --> 02:30:27.835]  You know, he's just a face in the window.
[02:30:28.276 --> 02:30:29.436]  Let's just really talk real.
[02:30:29.796 --> 02:30:31.816]  He's just the face they put in the window.
[02:30:32.156 --> 02:30:39.338]  You know, like all the rest of them, everybody we see, they're just the faces in the window that... He's just a compliant servant of the devil.
[02:30:39.558 --> 02:30:41.358]  By the way, the crew probably can't find it.
[02:30:41.378 --> 02:30:42.278]  Real power, Alex.
[02:30:42.378 --> 02:30:45.199]  We don't know their names and we never see their faces.
[02:30:45.699 --> 02:30:47.459]  They hide in Switzerland.
[02:30:48.530 --> 02:30:48.850]  They do.
[02:30:49.211 --> 02:30:50.251]  Guys, can you queue up?
[02:30:50.432 --> 02:30:53.234]  You probably can't find it, but two weeks ago I played Soros.
[02:30:53.274 --> 02:30:54.715]  He made an announcement in Germany.
[02:30:54.735 --> 02:30:59.779]  It's like an hour long, but he literally can't even talk now, but he doesn't know when to give up.
[02:30:59.899 --> 02:31:02.021]  He's just up there like bumbling around.
[02:31:02.041 --> 02:31:05.123]  Well, he doesn't have a soul, you can tell that.
[02:31:06.464 --> 02:31:06.865]  Can't you?
[02:31:07.145 --> 02:31:07.345]  Yeah.
[02:31:09.067 --> 02:31:09.527]  Exactly.
[02:31:09.587 --> 02:31:10.568]  So I want to say this.
[02:31:11.549 --> 02:31:12.850]  I don't hate George Soros.
[02:31:14.321 --> 02:31:14.981]  He's gone.
[02:31:15.682 --> 02:31:17.584]  Whatever happened, maybe he was a human at some point.
[02:31:17.744 --> 02:31:18.625]  I forgive him.
[02:31:18.645 --> 02:31:21.288]  Not because I'm even supporting what he did.
[02:31:21.308 --> 02:31:22.029]  I'm against what he did.
[02:31:22.389 --> 02:31:28.696]  But I think God does want us to just realize he's a fallen human that we couldn't save and he's a loss.
[02:31:29.212 --> 02:31:35.457]  Here's what I say to them, and I say it to all the billionaires there, because, you know, you can't be a billionaire without hurting a lot of people.
[02:31:36.397 --> 02:31:37.058]  There's no way.
[02:31:37.958 --> 02:31:45.504]  But to all the billionaires out there, you could, with your money, you could save every kid on this planet and help us turn it into heaven.
[02:31:45.584 --> 02:31:46.725]  You don't need all that money.
[02:31:47.345 --> 02:31:56.893]  And if you would do that and help people instead of hurt them, we would gladly welcome you back into the fold of human beings and you would be a hero too.
[02:31:57.333 --> 02:32:01.817]  And you would get so much love and acceptance and people would just marvel at you.
[02:32:02.477 --> 02:32:02.898]  Exactly!
[02:32:02.918 --> 02:32:04.079]  We're trying to give them amnesty.
[02:32:04.399 --> 02:32:05.280]  That's what you want.
[02:32:05.480 --> 02:32:09.843]  And so, you know, do the right thing and ask God to forgive you.
[02:32:10.043 --> 02:32:18.556]   And after that happens, You know, you will make amends to the human beings you've harmed, and you can come back with us and we'll have a lot of fun.
[02:32:19.817 --> 02:32:20.417]  No, I agree.
[02:32:20.597 --> 02:32:21.097]  I'm ready.
[02:32:21.117 --> 02:32:23.137]  And I'm not on some high horse.
[02:32:23.157 --> 02:32:24.078]  I admit what I've been wrong.
[02:32:24.158 --> 02:32:24.898]  It wasn't on purpose.
[02:32:25.498 --> 02:32:26.858]  We would love to see them.
[02:32:27.278 --> 02:32:32.879]  Well, where is, where is our Saul of Tarsus, you know, becoming Paul?
[02:32:33.380 --> 02:32:35.700]  Where, where are those defectors to our side?
[02:32:35.740 --> 02:32:36.860]  I mean, I'm starting to see some of it.
[02:32:36.880 --> 02:32:38.381]  Well, you saw Elon Musk.
[02:32:38.441 --> 02:32:40.181]  I think he's, he's one of them.
[02:32:41.010 --> 02:32:41.850]  Let's go to break.
[02:32:41.931 --> 02:32:42.551]  Let's go to break.
[02:32:43.571 --> 02:32:46.013]  Because you may not need a break, but I gotta go pee pee.
[02:32:46.213 --> 02:32:46.873]  Go for it.
[02:32:47.413 --> 02:32:49.094]  We're going to go to break for a couple minutes.
[02:32:49.114 --> 02:32:50.195]  You guys air whatever you want.
[02:32:50.215 --> 02:32:50.975]  We got a lot of great stuff.
[02:32:51.015 --> 02:32:51.796]  Roseanne Barr is on.
[02:32:51.956 --> 02:32:56.198]  I mean, I've seen a lot of your interviews, watched a lot of your podcasts you're doing, and it was all very informative.
[02:32:56.218 --> 02:32:57.459]  But I think this is a very special interview.
[02:32:58.184 --> 02:33:04.386]  I'm showing myself who I really am because I feel safe with you, Alex, and thank you for that opportunity.
[02:33:04.406 --> 02:33:12.768]  Well, I want to say I've always liked you, but in person you are way more, you're impressive on, very impressive in person.
[02:33:13.109 --> 02:33:13.929]  I can feel your aura.
[02:33:13.969 --> 02:33:14.969]  And so are you, Alex.
[02:33:15.029 --> 02:33:15.529]  Thank you.
[02:33:15.549 --> 02:33:17.570]  Appreciate you.
[02:33:17.590 --> 02:33:18.230]  All right.
[02:33:18.310 --> 02:33:23.692]  We'll, we'll, we'll go to tape here for a couple minutes and we're going to come back and just really go over this with Roseanne Barr.
[02:33:23.712 --> 02:33:24.432]  This is an amazing interview.
[02:33:24.452 --> 02:33:24.772]  Stay with us.
[02:33:26.283 --> 02:33:27.985]  Hello, Americans, I'm Paul Harvey.
[02:33:28.005 --> 02:33:29.947]  If I were the devil.
[02:33:30.828 --> 02:33:34.452]  If I were the prince of darkness, I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness.
[02:33:34.993 --> 02:33:41.580]  And I'd have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population, but I wouldn't be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree.
[02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:42.982]  Thee.
[02:33:44.483 --> 02:33:47.584]  So I'd set about however necessary to take over the United States.
[02:33:47.664 --> 02:33:51.144]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[02:33:51.404 --> 02:33:52.804]  I'd subvert the churches first.
[02:33:52.884 --> 02:33:54.605]  I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[02:33:55.005 --> 02:33:58.425]  With the wisdom of a serpent, I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve.
[02:33:58.645 --> 02:33:59.406]  Do as you please.
[02:33:59.866 --> 02:34:01.986]  To the young, I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[02:34:02.406 --> 02:34:05.887]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[02:34:06.287 --> 02:34:09.927]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[02:34:10.368 --> 02:34:12.568]  And the old, I would teach to pray after me.
[02:34:13.468 --> 02:34:15.810]  Our father, which art in Washington.
[02:34:16.731 --> 02:34:17.871]  And then I'd get organized.
[02:34:17.952 --> 02:34:23.936]  I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull or non-interesting.
[02:34:24.016 --> 02:34:27.118]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[02:34:27.419 --> 02:34:29.140]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[02:34:29.180 --> 02:34:32.182]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[02:34:32.482 --> 02:34:34.304]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[02:34:35.991 --> 02:34:46.038]  If I were the devil, I'd soon have families at war with themselves, churches at war with themselves, and nations at war with themselves, until each in its turn was consumed.
[02:34:46.498 --> 02:34:51.762]  And with promises of higher ratings, I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the flame.
[02:34:52.322 --> 02:34:54.644]  The President of the United States is racist.
[02:34:54.824 --> 02:35:01.971]  If I were the devil, I would encourage schools to refine young intellects, but neglect the disciplined emotions just on those one while.
[02:35:02.191 --> 02:35:07.416]  Within a decade, I'd have prisons overflowing, I'd have judges promoting pornography.
[02:35:07.536 --> 02:35:13.201]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then from the schoolhouse, and then from the houses of Congress.
[02:35:13.302 --> 02:35:16.384]  And in his own churches, I would substitute psychology for religion.
[02:35:18.388 --> 02:35:23.190]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[02:35:23.630 --> 02:35:30.993]  If I were the devil, I'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[02:35:32.654 --> 02:35:34.195]  I would caution against extremes.
[02:35:34.215 --> 02:35:35.455]  I'm here to warn people!
[02:35:35.475 --> 02:35:36.756]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[02:35:37.036 --> 02:35:37.896]  This isn't a game!
[02:35:38.117 --> 02:35:41.438]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct.
[02:35:42.148 --> 02:35:49.015]  I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned, that swinging is more fun, that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[02:35:49.675 --> 02:35:57.283]  And thus I could undress you in public, and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure.
[02:35:57.943 --> 02:36:01.943]   In other words, if I were the devil, I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[02:36:01.943 --> 02:36:24.943]  Now you know... the rest of the story.
[02:36:25.467 --> 02:36:27.608]  I want you to get up now.
[02:36:28.929 --> 02:36:31.011]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[02:36:31.031 --> 02:36:42.680]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[02:36:43.866 --> 02:36:45.327]  I want you to get up right now!
[02:36:45.567 --> 02:36:46.947]  Stick your head out of the window!
[02:36:47.067 --> 02:36:49.648]  Open it and stick your head out and keep yelling and yell!
[02:36:50.008 --> 02:36:51.468]  I'm as mad as hell!
[02:36:51.728 --> 02:36:53.289]  I'm not going to take this anymore!
[02:36:53.789 --> 02:36:56.210]  Just get up from your chairs right now!
[02:36:56.230 --> 02:36:57.150]  Go to the window!
[02:36:57.250 --> 02:36:57.830]  Where are you going?
[02:36:57.910 --> 02:36:59.551]  I don't want to see if anybody's yelling!
[02:36:59.591 --> 02:37:02.452]  Open it and stick your head out and yell and keep yelling!
[02:37:02.512 --> 02:37:02.872]  I'm mad as hell!
[02:37:02.912 --> 02:37:05.633]  I'm not going to take this anymore!
[02:37:06.133 --> 02:37:07.953]  I'm mad as hell!
[02:37:11.442 --> 02:37:12.703]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[02:37:15.824 --> 02:37:17.264]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[02:37:19.625 --> 02:37:21.426]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[02:37:23.747 --> 02:37:24.927]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[02:37:28.369 --> 02:37:31.250]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[02:37:31.270 --> 02:37:33.311]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[02:37:33.230 --> 02:37:40.230]  from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:37:40.230 --> 02:37:53.110]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak.
[02:37:53.496 --> 02:37:53.856]  We think.
[02:37:53.876 --> 02:37:54.456]  Just let me think.
[02:37:54.476 --> 02:37:59.958]  I suspect even now orders are being shouts into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[02:37:59.978 --> 02:38:01.799]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[02:38:01.819 --> 02:38:01.959]  Damn it!
[02:38:02.059 --> 02:38:02.499]  Why?
[02:38:03.139 --> 02:38:09.222]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[02:38:09.722 --> 02:38:12.883]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[02:38:15.685 --> 02:38:20.509]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[02:38:20.529 --> 02:38:21.489]  You designed it, sir.
[02:38:21.549 --> 02:38:22.470]  You wanted it foolproof.
[02:38:22.490 --> 02:38:23.931]  You taught me every television in London!
[02:38:24.131 --> 02:38:25.853]  Cruelty and injustice.
[02:38:26.253 --> 02:38:27.614]  Intolerance and oppression.
[02:38:28.035 --> 02:38:37.442]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and subduing your submissiveness.
[02:38:37.542 --> 02:38:37.842]  Cameras.
[02:38:37.862 --> 02:38:38.603]  We need cameras.
[02:38:38.883 --> 02:38:39.684]  How did this happen?
[02:38:40.364 --> 02:38:41.085]  Who's to blame?
[02:38:42.133 --> 02:38:44.718]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[02:38:44.738 --> 02:38:46.682]  They will be held accountable.
[02:38:47.082 --> 02:38:52.533]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[02:38:53.732 --> 02:38:55.213]  I know why you did it.
[02:38:55.713 --> 02:38:56.754]  I know you were afraid.
[02:38:56.774 --> 02:38:58.955]  Who would it be?
[02:38:58.975 --> 02:38:59.035]  War?
[02:38:59.215 --> 02:38:59.755]  Terror?
[02:38:59.855 --> 02:39:00.495]  Disease?
[02:39:00.515 --> 02:39:06.958]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[02:39:07.599 --> 02:39:13.381]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[02:39:13.761 --> 02:39:20.761]   He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[02:39:20.761 --> 02:39:27.761]  There is a war in the world.
[02:39:28.542 --> 02:39:29.543]  It's happening now.
[02:39:30.425 --> 02:39:32.247]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:39:32.808 --> 02:39:34.610]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:39:35.371 --> 02:39:36.833]  We are the Resistance.
[02:39:37.072 --> 02:39:39.072]  We are the InfoWar.
[02:39:39.072 --> 02:39:41.072]  [Explosion]
[02:39:41.072 --> 02:39:59.072]  [Music]
[02:39:59.288 --> 02:40:00.288]  Just keep rolling it.
[02:40:00.288 --> 02:40:01.288]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:40:01.288 --> 02:40:06.288]  (SINGING) We gotta fight the powers that be.
[02:40:06.288 --> 02:40:09.768]  Got so many voices.
[02:40:09.768 --> 02:40:13.768]  Say it on the stage.
[02:40:13.768 --> 02:40:17.768]  Giving up all around me.
[02:40:17.768 --> 02:40:18.768]  Faces full of pain.
[02:40:18.768 --> 02:40:21.268]  [INAUDIBLE]
[02:40:21.268 --> 02:40:23.807]  Roseanne, you're here.
[02:40:22.708 --> 02:40:24.208]  I've tried to get you here for years.
[02:40:24.228 --> 02:40:24.929]  We're live right now.
[02:40:25.369 --> 02:40:26.809]  Talk about anything you want.
[02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:32.692]  But I also want to talk about, you agree, there's no doubt a big awakening is here.
[02:40:33.333 --> 02:40:36.734]  The question is, the average person is saying, what do we do then?
[02:40:36.774 --> 02:40:37.515]  What's going to come next?
[02:40:37.535 --> 02:40:41.516]  I think what you said, jack in the Holy Spirit, jack in the God, and ask God what they should do.
[02:40:42.397 --> 02:40:42.797]  Okay.
[02:40:43.918 --> 02:40:44.658]  Here's what you do.
[02:40:45.546 --> 02:40:53.037]  You know, everybody's looking for a change from the top down, looking to our so-called leaders who are all just paid prostitutes of cartels.
[02:40:53.979 --> 02:40:56.643]  We're going to make the change happen from the bottom up.
[02:40:57.188 --> 02:40:59.710]  We have to make it happen at the grassroots.
[02:40:59.770 --> 02:41:02.493]  That means you've got to run for office.
[02:41:02.593 --> 02:41:05.555]  You've got to go in there to the school boards and sit.
[02:41:05.595 --> 02:41:07.637]  Like, people are actually doing it, too.
[02:41:08.177 --> 02:41:15.003]  People are taking this government into their own hands and realizing it is a government of, by, and for the people.
[02:41:15.023 --> 02:41:20.528]  And that scared the system two years ago when they sent the FBI to harass people that were protesting school boards peacefully.
[02:41:20.788 --> 02:41:21.869]  Yeah, the moms and dads.
[02:41:21.909 --> 02:41:23.930]  Calling them terrorists, because they're scared of that.
[02:41:24.310 --> 02:41:24.510]  Yeah.
[02:41:24.731 --> 02:41:25.751]  That's your community.
[02:41:25.831 --> 02:41:26.492]  You run that.
[02:41:26.552 --> 02:41:27.392]  That's your family.
[02:41:27.692 --> 02:41:31.215]  You pay those taxes, not some, you know, IMF, World Bank thing.
[02:41:31.455 --> 02:41:31.915]  That's right.
[02:41:31.975 --> 02:41:44.263]  And those taxes, everybody, and they've also, well, I won't go into that, but, you know, it's our, we pay taxes to get something back, like roads, schools, hospitals, and such.
[02:41:44.843 --> 02:41:53.572]   Instead, they're taking our taxes and going out and giving it to They're putting public money into private pockets, is what they're doing.
[02:41:54.093 --> 02:42:02.386]  And then they go and sell weapons to both sides of every skirmish across the seas, and they're all making money on all of it.
[02:42:03.959 --> 02:42:05.180]  I won't even go into that.
[02:42:05.260 --> 02:42:13.068]  How, you know, they start wars and arm both sides and pretty soon everything has a KFC and a Banana Republic.
[02:42:13.469 --> 02:42:14.169]  I mean, come on.
[02:42:14.690 --> 02:42:16.472]  It's just really sickening to me.
[02:42:16.852 --> 02:42:21.757]  That's our tax money and that means it belongs in our communities that pay those taxes.
[02:42:22.437 --> 02:42:26.941]  It belongs for roads, for police, for the people who pay those.
[02:42:27.041 --> 02:42:28.903]  And notice that's the things they're all defunding.
[02:42:28.943 --> 02:42:30.904]  The infrastructure, the police.
[02:42:30.964 --> 02:42:33.927]  Not the police are perfect, but they're defunding it to cause chaos.
[02:42:34.407 --> 02:42:37.790]  But they thought they would cause chaos and then blame America.
[02:42:38.130 --> 02:42:40.973]  The average American gets it's an outside force doing this.
[02:42:41.453 --> 02:42:43.695]  The globalists aren't very happy right now because they're getting the blame.
[02:42:45.236 --> 02:42:46.117]  Well, it's their fault.
[02:42:47.270 --> 02:42:55.935]  Like it's the billionaire's fault that, you know, you don't get a billion dollars without screwing over innumerable amounts of people.
[02:42:56.395 --> 02:42:57.236]  You just don't.
[02:42:58.597 --> 02:43:03.419]  You know, that's why I, one thing that bugs me about Kanye or Ye, whatever.
[02:43:03.439 --> 02:43:06.301]  Hey, talk about being a billionaire, Kanye.
[02:43:06.621 --> 02:43:09.643]  Where, where do the, are their children sewing them clothes?
[02:43:10.003 --> 02:43:10.643]  Come on, man.
[02:43:10.684 --> 02:43:13.085]  You, you've got a billion dollars or had.
[02:43:14.375 --> 02:43:17.158]  It isn't moral to have a billion dollars.
[02:43:17.218 --> 02:43:26.166]  Well, I'm not even attacking Ye over having money, but my issue was, I talked to him and I said, I want to come out and talk about love.
[02:43:26.206 --> 02:43:27.187]  He goes, yeah, I want to talk about love.
[02:43:27.707 --> 02:43:31.211]  And he got here in a mask and did this whole Hitler thing.
[02:43:31.251 --> 02:43:33.733]  And I went, hey, Hitler blew up Poland that did nothing.
[02:43:34.474 --> 02:43:37.376]  Let's just believe your postulation that Jews are evil and they're going to be killed.
[02:43:37.396 --> 02:43:38.037]  I don't agree with that.
[02:43:38.157 --> 02:43:38.577]  It's wrong.
[02:43:39.452 --> 02:43:41.174]  But what about Poland?
[02:43:41.314 --> 02:43:41.974]  Didn't have an answer.
[02:43:42.355 --> 02:43:43.636]  I said, what about my grandfather's?
[02:43:44.256 --> 02:43:47.940]  My dad's dad was in the Army Air Corps, flew a bunch of missions, volunteered for more.
[02:43:48.380 --> 02:43:51.843]  And then he was an officer in the invasion of Germany.
[02:43:51.963 --> 02:43:52.944]  And he saw the death camps.
[02:43:53.324 --> 02:43:54.405]  He would hardly talk about it.
[02:43:55.546 --> 02:44:00.551]  And he saw piles of dead bodies everywhere, black birds eating all these dead people.
[02:44:01.349 --> 02:44:05.010]  Literally bulldozers, piles of dead bodies, worse than anything you saw on TV.
[02:44:05.411 --> 02:44:06.511]  He told me that when I was a little kid.
[02:44:06.531 --> 02:44:07.191]  He told my dad that.
[02:44:07.571 --> 02:44:10.553]  And he said, yeah, like, you know, it's just your grandfather.
[02:44:11.253 --> 02:44:15.194]  And to me, it's like, I don't need to watch PBS and know Hitler was bad, killed a bunch of people.
[02:44:15.634 --> 02:44:17.895]  My grandfather saw it.
[02:44:18.376 --> 02:44:25.198]  And the thing to just disregard that as, you know, and I'm not even, I don't agree with his censorship either.
[02:44:25.858 --> 02:44:27.419]  I think things like that need to be heard.
[02:44:28.536 --> 02:44:33.800]  Well, it really pissed me off when he was talking to him and Dave Chappelle saying, the Jews, the Jews.
[02:44:33.860 --> 02:44:34.960]  That really pissed me off.
[02:44:35.281 --> 02:44:36.662]  Because, I mean, that was classic.
[02:44:36.682 --> 02:44:38.363]  It was like the left saying, the white people.
[02:44:38.403 --> 02:44:41.505]  Like, what is it my fault if some Jeffrey Dahmer eats people?
[02:44:41.525 --> 02:44:42.466]  Because he's white.
[02:44:42.566 --> 02:44:43.486]  Like, I didn't do that.
[02:44:44.067 --> 02:44:46.128]  Or, like, oh, a black guy killed a white person.
[02:44:46.168 --> 02:44:47.289]  That's not a black people's fault.
[02:44:47.549 --> 02:44:48.450]  That's what I was going to say.
[02:44:48.470 --> 02:44:51.251]  That'd be like me coming on here and saying, the blacks.
[02:44:51.732 --> 02:44:52.472]  I mean, come on.
[02:44:53.052 --> 02:44:56.815]  There's millions of kinds of Jewish people.
[02:44:57.335 --> 02:44:59.957]  That's what I was here to prove.
[02:45:00.337 --> 02:45:03.059]  There are lots of different kinds of Jewish people.
[02:45:03.359 --> 02:45:07.982]  The kind of Judaism I practice is based in, you know, North Africa.
[02:45:08.462 --> 02:45:09.443]  It's Iraqi.
[02:45:09.603 --> 02:45:10.643]  It's Sephardic.
[02:45:11.144 --> 02:45:13.145]  So, you know, to say that... Well, they can say.
[02:45:13.185 --> 02:45:15.346]  I've studied the anthropological angle of that.
[02:45:15.747 --> 02:45:18.188]  I believe Sephardic Judaism is probably the oldest, purest.
[02:45:18.608 --> 02:45:19.529]  Of course it is.
[02:45:19.729 --> 02:45:21.090]  And I was raised that way.
[02:45:21.150 --> 02:45:23.371]  And Aaron Russo was a Sephardic Jew and a beautiful soul.
[02:45:23.931 --> 02:45:25.512]  Oh my God, wasn't he?
[02:45:25.632 --> 02:45:26.713]  He was a prophet.
[02:45:26.733 --> 02:45:27.314]  Yeah, he was.
[02:45:27.394 --> 02:45:27.854]  Super smart.
[02:45:28.519 --> 02:45:29.800]  Oh my God, he really saw it.
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:30.481]  He loved people.
[02:45:30.521 --> 02:45:31.101]  You could feel it.
[02:45:31.462 --> 02:45:31.862]  Yeah.
[02:45:31.962 --> 02:45:33.603]  So it's like, it's this paradox.
[02:45:34.024 --> 02:45:38.007]  Any powerful group, and all humans have powerful groups, but the Jews are powerful.
[02:45:38.047 --> 02:45:38.568]  Let's admit it.
[02:45:38.588 --> 02:45:40.409]  The whole culture of the world is based on it.
[02:45:40.649 --> 02:45:50.838]  And so there's good ones and there's bad ones, but we never say, you know, if my father, who's a great guy, it's hypothetical, if he murdered somebody 50 years ago, I didn't do what my father did.
[02:45:51.098 --> 02:45:51.378]  Right.
[02:45:51.858 --> 02:45:55.480]  That's collective punishment, which is part of communism.
[02:45:55.680 --> 02:45:56.941]  Total communism.
[02:45:57.601 --> 02:45:59.322]  Which is reparations and all this crap.
[02:46:01.202 --> 02:46:02.923]  It's satanic.
[02:46:03.463 --> 02:46:05.444]  And Marx himself loved the devil.
[02:46:06.545 --> 02:46:07.345]  Talk about that.
[02:46:07.545 --> 02:46:08.265]  And so did Lenin.
[02:46:08.846 --> 02:46:09.506]  Yeah, they did.
[02:46:09.546 --> 02:46:10.446]  They loved the devil.
[02:46:11.427 --> 02:46:18.560]   Because they considered Lucifer to be the bearer of light, you know, the person that You know, they got it all backwards.
[02:46:18.760 --> 02:46:21.443]  But that's all coming up this week in Purim.
[02:46:22.424 --> 02:46:28.529]  Purim tells the whole story of how these people... Talk about this special Jewish holiday right now.
[02:46:28.549 --> 02:46:30.371]  You were going to give some Jewish secrets.
[02:46:30.411 --> 02:46:30.972]  Tell us.
[02:46:31.052 --> 02:46:31.612]  Well, I did.
[02:46:31.672 --> 02:46:33.034]  I told you about... No, you didn't.
[02:46:33.054 --> 02:46:33.994]  You haven't got the floor.
[02:46:34.495 --> 02:46:35.936]  Don't let me interrupt because I'm bad.
[02:46:36.217 --> 02:46:36.677]  You've got the floor.
[02:46:36.717 --> 02:46:37.358]  No, you're not bad.
[02:46:39.574 --> 02:46:42.437]  Well, it's just about unscrambling the scramble.
[02:46:42.817 --> 02:46:46.981]  That's what it's about, reversing the reversal, putting things right.
[02:46:48.102 --> 02:46:55.989]  And, you know, these people, these Satanists, what they did was reverse everything of power.
[02:46:56.470 --> 02:47:07.025]   I mean, in in this world right now, how it works, it looks like they got black magician, I'm talking about Power.
[02:47:08.066 --> 02:47:11.872]  There's black magic and white magic as they define it.
[02:47:12.874 --> 02:47:13.154]  Right?
[02:47:15.497 --> 02:47:18.762]  But that don't have nothing to do with God.
[02:47:20.605 --> 02:47:21.126]  Nothing to do.
[02:47:22.838 --> 02:47:27.898]   And what they did was take what was holy in the temple, I'm talking about that,
[02:47:27.898 --> 02:47:34.918]   because what was holy about the temple was that it was built on the human mind,
[02:47:34.918 --> 02:47:40.119]   the chambers of the human mind of meditation and the gates you have to go through
[02:47:40.119 --> 02:47:46.779]   to get to the clear space that you were talking about, the clear space, the still small voice,
[02:47:46.779 --> 02:47:51.619]   where you connect, where you plug it into the wall, you know what I mean?
[02:47:51.619 --> 02:47:57.018]   That's what they're really afraid of, is that we remember our connection to the divine,
[02:47:57.018 --> 02:48:00.338]  who we are, that we remember who we are.
[02:48:00.338 --> 02:48:07.679]   And, oh, they hate that so bad, because then that would,
[02:48:07.679 --> 02:48:12.179]  it's like in that movie "Moana."
[02:48:12.299 --> 02:48:13.279]  I love that movie.
[02:48:13.319 --> 02:48:21.885]  I've seen it so many times where she gives the heart back to Tafiti and suddenly everything dead blooms again and comes back to life.
[02:48:22.586 --> 02:48:23.646]  Did you see that movie?
[02:48:24.487 --> 02:48:25.308]  I love that movie.
[02:48:25.408 --> 02:48:27.009]  It's funny that Disney did it.
[02:48:27.249 --> 02:48:30.451]  It was creeped me out, really, that Disney did it.
[02:48:31.072 --> 02:48:33.753]  But that's a whole other subject.
[02:48:33.953 --> 02:48:35.074]  You know, I did work for Disney.
[02:48:36.335 --> 02:48:41.017]  Let's talk about the episode I wrote when Disney bought ABC later.
[02:48:41.457 --> 02:48:48.240]  But anyway, they're really afraid of people who are connected to God.
[02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:49.440]  They don't like that.
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:55.083]  They don't like it in Islam, in Christianity, in Judaism, anywhere, or Buddhism.
[02:48:55.103 --> 02:48:58.584]  They want us to go to the priest, which Christ was the opposite of.
[02:48:58.744 --> 02:49:00.405]  They want us to bow to man.
[02:49:02.361 --> 02:49:02.621]  Right?
[02:49:03.101 --> 02:49:03.561]  Absolutely.
[02:49:03.601 --> 02:49:05.982]  Well, I can tell you a story going back about three years ago.
[02:49:06.002 --> 02:49:11.504]  I was under major attack, but I always thought I was strong enough to do it.
[02:49:11.524 --> 02:49:14.144]  Yeah, God's there and God supports me, but I'm strong enough.
[02:49:14.745 --> 02:49:21.607]  And I went through a lot of stuff and I was having really deep experiences and like given knowledge I couldn't even understand and things.
[02:49:21.687 --> 02:49:24.970]   And I said, God, Give me peace to be strong.
[02:49:25.511 --> 02:49:26.892]  Let me really see what it is.
[02:49:26.912 --> 02:49:28.753]  I never really prayed for something.
[02:49:28.773 --> 02:49:30.175]  I always said, what's your will God?
[02:49:30.195 --> 02:49:31.216]  But I didn't say prayers.
[02:49:31.916 --> 02:49:35.599]  Will you show me what it is and give me the knowledge?
[02:49:35.639 --> 02:49:42.706]  And I remember a couple of weeks after saying that prayer every day, I had a series of dreams and I know the different feelings.
[02:49:42.726 --> 02:49:44.487]  It's like a different flavor you've never tasted.
[02:49:44.847 --> 02:49:45.908]  You finally taste a new flavor.
[02:49:45.928 --> 02:49:47.450]  You go, God, I've never had that new flavor.
[02:49:48.110 --> 02:49:51.930]   This was In this experience was 100% real.
[02:49:52.611 --> 02:49:53.653]  I couldn't even see the angel.
[02:49:53.733 --> 02:50:01.809]  It was like it was there behind me showing me the universe and other civilizations and things that happened and how it works and everything is total knowledge download and like.
[02:50:02.915 --> 02:50:04.236]  Feeling totally complete.
[02:50:04.737 --> 02:50:05.557]  Not ecstasy.
[02:50:06.198 --> 02:50:06.978]  It was beyond ecstasy.
[02:50:06.998 --> 02:50:08.159]  It was like timelessness.
[02:50:08.199 --> 02:50:09.280]  Like, I'm good forever.
[02:50:09.961 --> 02:50:11.242]  This is a good spot right here.
[02:50:11.762 --> 02:50:13.424]  But then, well, I got a curiosity.
[02:50:13.504 --> 02:50:14.825]  I want to look into what happened here.
[02:50:14.965 --> 02:50:15.585]  Why this happened.
[02:50:15.986 --> 02:50:19.208]  And I could see like civilizations that destroyed themselves and individuals that did.
[02:50:19.629 --> 02:50:21.210]  They were like walled up tombs.
[02:50:21.290 --> 02:50:22.111]  God gave what they wanted.
[02:50:22.131 --> 02:50:23.152]  They were their own little thing.
[02:50:24.858 --> 02:50:27.500]  It was like old men just sifting sand forever.
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.222]  Like they weren't even, they were cut off from God.
[02:50:30.262 --> 02:50:31.162]  They wanted to be God.
[02:50:31.182 --> 02:50:33.544]  And it was so powerful.
[02:50:33.584 --> 02:50:35.585]  And I said, can I just stay here?
[02:50:35.645 --> 02:50:37.947]  Can I know you've got stuff to do, but you're already here.
[02:50:38.447 --> 02:50:39.408]  And then it happened again.
[02:50:39.428 --> 02:50:45.532]  And I got a little touch of it again, but that feeling is undoubtedly outside my body.
[02:50:45.752 --> 02:50:50.655]  There's no connection to anything ever experienced like that because it's so intense.
[02:50:50.715 --> 02:50:52.516]  You can't even, it's so intense.
[02:50:52.536 --> 02:50:53.057]  You're done.
[02:50:53.117 --> 02:50:54.718]  It's like, you're just like, I am complete.
[02:50:54.637 --> 02:50:58.137]  this is absolute connection to everything.
[02:50:58.137 --> 02:50:59.776]  There's no time.
[02:50:59.776 --> 02:51:01.436]  It's like I'm here.
[02:51:01.436 --> 02:51:06.576]  And that is what the enemy knows they've cut off from.
[02:51:06.576 --> 02:51:08.117]  Yeah, they get to go against God.
[02:51:08.117 --> 02:51:09.257]  Yeah, they get to do bad things.
[02:51:09.257 --> 02:51:10.537]  Yeah, they get to play God.
[02:51:10.537 --> 02:51:13.457]  But they've been cut off from that.
[02:51:13.457 --> 02:51:15.537]  I know what you mean.
[02:51:15.537 --> 02:51:16.897]  Have you felt that?
[02:51:16.897 --> 02:51:21.976]   Yes, when I was three, I felt it first when I was three years old.
[02:51:21.342 --> 02:51:26.324]  I was in my grandmother's bathroom and I grew up in an apartment house.
[02:51:26.364 --> 02:51:32.746]  My grandparents in Salt Lake City, they owned an apartment house and they sponsored people to come over from Auschwitz.
[02:51:33.906 --> 02:51:36.527]  And the apartment house was filled with survivors.
[02:51:39.542 --> 02:51:48.890]  That's how I started comedy, too, because my grandma had a windowsill, and I used to like to go in there and sing and dance for the people every Shabbat.
[02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:56.117]  We had Shabbat dinner on Friday night, and I would do my Shirley Temple act, and those people lied to me, too.
[02:51:56.653 --> 02:51:59.675]  They told me I was better than Shirley Temple.
[02:52:00.376 --> 02:52:03.758]  They told me I was cuter than Shirley Temple, and I believed them.
[02:52:03.778 --> 02:52:04.618]  Maybe they weren't lying.
[02:52:05.119 --> 02:52:05.899]  No, they were lying.
[02:52:06.700 --> 02:52:12.484]  I realized later, but anyway, they would all retell stories.
[02:52:12.504 --> 02:52:17.627]  I was only three, and they were watching the Eichmann trial, too, on TV.
[02:52:19.188 --> 02:52:20.709]  I came in, they were watching TV.
[02:52:22.208 --> 02:52:34.192]  I saw on TV pictures of the Holocaust and they would tell stories and I remember they told, they'd point to me and they'd say, little girls like her, they hung them on a meat hook.
[02:52:35.072 --> 02:52:36.392]  That's the one I remember.
[02:52:37.793 --> 02:52:41.934]  And I, I was so scared and I thought we lived there.
[02:52:41.954 --> 02:52:49.416]  I went in my grandma's bathroom and I was barely tall enough to lock the doors, locking them out.
[02:52:50.766 --> 02:52:53.687]  And I was sitting there, and I was so afraid.
[02:52:53.747 --> 02:52:55.347]  I thought that was going to happen to us.
[02:52:55.447 --> 02:53:01.429]  And I saw something in the air right in front of me.
[02:53:01.909 --> 02:53:05.971]  It was a man on a horse, and he pointed to me.
[02:53:06.671 --> 02:53:09.892]  And he told me that I was going to live and that I was going to be okay.
[02:53:10.712 --> 02:53:41.898]   Okay, and he told me that he was always going to be with me and that someday I was going to have an answer for every question that was in my mind at that time and that I would always find my answers in books and that it would be it would I would find my answers in books and I never I never forgot or left that and I would be like in my life and You know, it's like they call it mental illness and stuff.
[02:53:42.258 --> 02:53:42.979]  They call it that.
[02:53:43.419 --> 02:53:52.202]  But in my life, I would get these feelings that, and I would go, I would go to a bookstore, and I would have a question in my mind.
[02:53:52.262 --> 02:53:55.644]  I'd find a book, I'd open it, and there would be the answer every time.
[02:53:56.444 --> 02:53:57.965]  All over the world, I've done that.
[02:53:58.425 --> 02:54:01.186]  When I get this certain feeling, I'm guided to a book.
[02:54:01.726 --> 02:54:02.667]  I always find it.
[02:54:03.367 --> 02:54:05.188]  And that happened to me just yesterday.
[02:54:05.208 --> 02:54:07.589]  They want to cut us off from the Divine.
[02:54:07.629 --> 02:54:08.309]  I'll tell you a story.
[02:54:08.909 --> 02:54:18.011]  I was afraid to tell anybody that I had that feeling because I knew always don't tell nobody because they'll try to take you away from God.
[02:54:18.411 --> 02:54:23.632]  They'll try to cut out parts of your brain and say you're schizophrenic and all this and that.
[02:54:23.972 --> 02:54:26.952]  But that is what they're trying to take from us.
[02:54:27.012 --> 02:54:37.914]  But I want to say when I got deplatformed and they took my life's work away from me and called me racist and all that stuff after being a lifetime of a civil rights worker.
[02:54:39.215 --> 02:54:46.019]  I had to remember back to that day so hard and go, are they going to take all my life?
[02:54:46.100 --> 02:54:50.943]  I fought from them taking me away from God when they put me through all that therapy.
[02:54:50.983 --> 02:54:57.508]  And I said to my therapist in the mental institutions I've been in, you're not going to take me away from God.
[02:54:57.787 --> 02:55:02.347]   you're not ever going to cut me away from thinking that I don't have connection to God,
[02:55:02.347 --> 02:55:04.827]  because I know what psychiatry is about and this and that.
[02:55:04.827 --> 02:55:14.826]   I had like a big old nervous breakdown when that happened to me.
[02:55:14.981 --> 02:55:21.527]  And... I... I asked why, why, why?
[02:55:22.628 --> 02:55:25.410]  Why have I been mischaracterized?
[02:55:25.711 --> 02:55:28.854]  Why did they not let me even explain myself?
[02:55:29.754 --> 02:55:31.156]  And uh... They were scared of you.
[02:55:32.632 --> 02:55:43.876]  And, uh, but the thing that's most remarkable to me, Alex, is I didn't lose my faith because I could have easily, the way they tortured me, I could have lost my faith.
[02:55:44.396 --> 02:55:47.398]  But I just am so happy that I didn't.
[02:55:48.278 --> 02:55:49.839]  They couldn't take it from me.
[02:55:50.739 --> 02:55:51.319]  That's beautiful.
[02:55:51.599 --> 02:55:53.540]  Well, I'll share some things that are on a percent.
[02:55:54.639 --> 02:55:58.642]  There's no doubt we're connected to the past, the present and infinity through God.
[02:55:59.422 --> 02:56:03.505]  And I won't tell all the stories, but I'll tell one and it's on record.
[02:56:04.066 --> 02:56:10.030]  People ask how I went on air on July 25th, 2001 and said they're going to blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on bin Laden.
[02:56:11.562 --> 02:56:13.704]  At the time I said, oh, I've looked at the news, I can tell it.
[02:56:13.744 --> 02:56:21.169]  No, I had recurring dreams every night starting in May of 2021 of the planes crashing.
[02:56:21.189 --> 02:56:23.170]  I told my ex-wife it, she knows that.
[02:56:23.731 --> 02:56:26.693]  And I went on air that morning and said, there's bombs in the building, they've blown it up.
[02:56:27.053 --> 02:56:31.196]  Because I was given that dream almost every night for three months before.
[02:56:31.676 --> 02:56:34.338]  And I went on air and I said, they're going to blow up the World Trade Center.
[02:56:34.798 --> 02:56:36.980]  I see them collapsing and they're going to launch all this war.
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.121]  They're going to take our rights away, which is in the future.
[02:56:39.161 --> 02:56:39.802]  And that was real.
[02:56:41.149 --> 02:56:43.351]  And it's that connection to the divine.
[02:56:43.951 --> 02:56:48.995]  We're able to jack into not just 5G and all this fake stuff, the tinker toys they've created.
[02:56:49.035 --> 02:56:50.236]  The whole universe is that.
[02:56:50.976 --> 02:56:57.601]  NASA put out last week a video admitting the sun has the exact heartbeat like a 45 year old resting person.
[02:56:57.701 --> 02:56:59.662]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:57:00.323 --> 02:57:02.765]  It's all as above, so below.
[02:57:03.825 --> 02:57:08.494]   And so anybody Trying to deny that's going on is a liar.
[02:57:08.754 --> 02:57:14.340]  The CIA, the KGB, all of them have been obsessed on Mind War for 60, 70, 80 years.
[02:57:14.500 --> 02:57:15.922]  They know it's the answer.
[02:57:16.022 --> 02:57:16.463]  They know.
[02:57:16.843 --> 02:57:17.323]  They know.
[02:57:17.784 --> 02:57:23.410]  And they don't want us to reach out to that infinite and realize it's there because then you don't care about movies.
[02:57:23.430 --> 02:57:25.392]  You don't care about people criticizing.
[02:57:25.612 --> 02:57:27.214]  You care about the infinite and the divine.
[02:57:27.735 --> 02:57:28.696]  And that's what you're connected to.
[02:57:29.133 --> 02:57:34.316]  They also don't want us to know, this is something I'll share, I just got it while you were talking.
[02:57:35.456 --> 02:57:39.218]  They don't want us to know how things work as above, so below.
[02:57:39.278 --> 02:57:50.364]  Here's how things work in meditation, in Jewish meditation, Sephardic meditation, that how we, and the book of Esther too, which is coming up.
[02:57:51.124 --> 02:58:03.732]  Because the prayer of Esther, she prayed to God to give me the words and the same words that she prayed to God are the same words she used on the king to get him to nullify the decree.
[02:58:04.612 --> 02:58:05.533]  He didn't nullify it.
[02:58:05.873 --> 02:58:07.074]  He just amended it.
[02:58:07.194 --> 02:58:17.360]  But anyway, what we what people don't know what's been kept from them is that it is the below that stimulates the above.
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:19.201]  That's what people don't know.
[02:58:19.221 --> 02:58:20.582]  They don't know.
[02:58:21.348 --> 02:58:29.177]  That when they tell us that the cries of the people were heard by the above, and so God moved.
[02:58:32.237 --> 02:58:43.306]  What happens is that the will of the people united stimulates the upper world to come down here and act on our behalf.
[02:58:43.686 --> 02:58:45.348]  It's an electrochemical connection.
[02:58:45.428 --> 02:58:45.708]  It is.
[02:58:45.728 --> 02:58:48.590]  Lightning doesn't, everybody thinks lightning goes down.
[02:58:48.610 --> 02:58:49.451]  No, it starts at the bottom.
[02:58:49.531 --> 02:58:51.113]  That's right, exactly.
[02:58:51.673 --> 02:58:53.975]  And so, that's why prayer works.
[02:58:54.997 --> 02:59:01.520]  That's why it works, because we stimulate the upper world, which, you know, God is... We're calling in the coordinates.
[02:59:02.680 --> 02:59:05.341]  Yeah, we're asking, we're praying.
[02:59:05.541 --> 02:59:07.922]  Yeah, we're calling in the coordinates is a good way of putting it.
[02:59:08.323 --> 02:59:22.861]   But to think that we have that power and all we have to do is just The power of words, and my boyfriend Johnny always says, everything is strung together with words, therefore everything can be undone with words.
[02:59:23.321 --> 02:59:25.082]  And when you think of the power of the people.
[02:59:25.102 --> 02:59:27.664]  And that's why they're attacking language, because they know through the word.
[02:59:27.684 --> 02:59:30.907]  Yeah, well, the word.
[02:59:32.496 --> 02:59:39.683]  You know, they all say in religion, in the beginning was the Word, but the truth is, in the beginning was the hearing.
[02:59:40.203 --> 02:59:44.006]  Because if you couldn't hear the Word, what would it matter?
[02:59:44.567 --> 02:59:45.267]  The hearing.
[02:59:46.048 --> 02:59:47.389]  And the people can hear.
[02:59:47.750 --> 02:59:49.151]  That's part of the awakening.
[02:59:49.771 --> 03:00:03.143]  And when the people can hear and when the people can speak, they'll speak and move mountains and the upper world will come in our defense.
[03:00:03.804 --> 03:00:04.544]  I totally agree.
[03:00:04.564 --> 03:00:05.205]  So let me say this.
[03:00:05.345 --> 03:00:06.526]  I don't say this to brag.
[03:00:06.546 --> 03:00:07.387]  I started the whole show with this.
[03:00:08.067 --> 03:00:11.932]   I went down to Mexico because I've been working, you know, 20 hours a day.
[03:00:11.952 --> 03:00:13.616]  15 hours a day forever.
[03:00:13.636 --> 03:00:15.941]  I promise to start taking off almost a week a month.
[03:00:16.362 --> 03:00:17.204]  Because I have to.
[03:00:17.244 --> 03:00:18.506]  My family, my parents are getting old.
[03:00:18.727 --> 03:00:19.569]  Kids are everything.
[03:00:19.589 --> 03:00:19.649]  And...
[03:00:21.897 --> 03:00:24.998]  I used to get attacked some, not a lot, mainly love, but some attacks.
[03:00:25.778 --> 03:00:31.979]  I'm in international airports, Texas, Mexico, everywhere, nothing but love, and I'm in a restaurant, everyone comes over like a movie.
[03:00:31.999 --> 03:00:32.779]  We didn't have a camera.
[03:00:32.799 --> 03:00:35.760]  You know, the camera guy, I took the camera with me, he was back at the gate.
[03:00:36.440 --> 03:00:48.302]  Literally, almost everyone in the restaurant, the servers, people from England, people from Russia, people from South Korea, people from Austin, people from Mexico, all came up, and it was just like, wait, my wife goes, this is the whole restaurant.
[03:00:48.802 --> 03:00:52.974]   Everyone just came over, they weren't just, they all knew about, It wasn't about me.
[03:00:53.274 --> 03:00:55.035]  It was that they knew they were awake.
[03:00:55.335 --> 03:00:56.575]  They said, we know you're under attack.
[03:00:56.615 --> 03:00:57.095]  We love you.
[03:00:57.135 --> 03:00:57.795]  Just keep fighting.
[03:00:58.236 --> 03:00:59.336]  And it was so magic.
[03:01:00.816 --> 03:01:02.877]  The average person isn't a public figure, which is a great thing.
[03:01:02.897 --> 03:01:04.077]  You're not public, you're left alone.
[03:01:04.477 --> 03:01:05.717]  But we're public figures.
[03:01:06.277 --> 03:01:07.438]  I don't know what you're seeing.
[03:01:07.458 --> 03:01:09.758]  I haven't asked you yet, but all I'm getting is love now.
[03:01:10.178 --> 03:01:12.639]  Like, I mean, knock on wood, because I don't like being attacked.
[03:01:12.679 --> 03:01:13.359]  It's happened a lot.
[03:01:13.759 --> 03:01:15.880]  It's not happening to any now.
[03:01:15.900 --> 03:01:17.780]  That looks to me like the enemy's in a lot of trouble.
[03:01:18.540 --> 03:01:20.861]  It's magnetism, isn't it?
[03:01:21.789 --> 03:01:22.049]  It is.
[03:01:22.369 --> 03:01:28.574]  It's our fellows and our sisters are attracted to our words.
[03:01:29.075 --> 03:01:29.835]  That's what it is.
[03:01:30.396 --> 03:01:31.657]  Because they think them too.
[03:01:32.958 --> 03:01:34.559]  It's like whatever it is.
[03:01:34.599 --> 03:01:35.380]  Yeah, we are them.
[03:01:35.400 --> 03:01:36.180]  It is.
[03:01:36.421 --> 03:01:38.002]  We're all thinking the same way.
[03:01:38.122 --> 03:01:39.443]  We're magnetizing.
[03:01:40.344 --> 03:01:41.424]  So what is the enemy going to do?
[03:01:41.444 --> 03:01:50.572]  Because there's a real poll is Alex Jones goes to airports, Alex Jones goes to Mexico, and literally the waiters would have to give us the food free all the time.
[03:01:51.516 --> 03:01:53.678]  I couldn't even speak Spanish, but they were like, we love you, we love you.
[03:01:54.679 --> 03:01:56.320]  I had a dilemma the other night.
[03:01:56.720 --> 03:01:59.263]  They was offering free non-kosher food.
[03:02:02.565 --> 03:02:03.046]  Absolutely.
[03:02:03.146 --> 03:02:04.307]  I bring that up as a paradox.
[03:02:04.407 --> 03:02:05.588]  They have really screwed up.
[03:02:05.788 --> 03:02:08.390]  I mean, like they thought they would demonize me.
[03:02:08.630 --> 03:02:09.531]  I'm not even perfect.
[03:02:09.551 --> 03:02:10.232]  I'm far from perfect.
[03:02:10.680 --> 03:02:13.381]  But that's what they do, because that's what evil does.
[03:02:13.722 --> 03:02:20.425]  Evil just eats everything around it, and when it's already killed everything good, there's nothing left to eat but itself.
[03:02:21.326 --> 03:02:22.146]  And so it does.
[03:02:22.446 --> 03:02:23.367]  And that's what they did.
[03:02:23.847 --> 03:02:26.749]  They gotta keep eating, and they gotta keep destroying.
[03:02:26.769 --> 03:02:27.229]  I agree.
[03:02:27.249 --> 03:02:28.830]  So what do you quantify that as?
[03:02:29.210 --> 03:02:30.891]  That I'm now getting nothing but love?
[03:02:32.032 --> 03:02:33.232]  I'm just a gauge, I'm nobody.
[03:02:33.573 --> 03:02:36.094]  But now that I'm getting nothing but love, what does that say about the system?
[03:02:36.528 --> 03:02:39.270]  It says that the system and evil is dead.
[03:02:39.330 --> 03:02:40.351]  They're out of our way.
[03:02:40.371 --> 03:02:42.252]  And that's what I came here today to say.
[03:02:42.352 --> 03:02:42.993]  God won.
[03:02:43.253 --> 03:02:44.074]  That's what I wanted to say.
[03:02:44.154 --> 03:02:44.494]  Exactly.
[03:02:44.554 --> 03:02:45.435]  I'm like, we're winning.
[03:02:45.515 --> 03:02:46.516]  All I'm getting is love.
[03:02:46.576 --> 03:02:47.296]  We already won.
[03:02:47.316 --> 03:02:50.839]  From the Mexican border police.
[03:02:50.879 --> 03:02:53.641]  From the Homeland Security when I got here.
[03:02:53.661 --> 03:02:54.462]  Hey, we love you, Alex.
[03:02:54.702 --> 03:02:56.523]  My passport was nothing but love.
[03:02:56.543 --> 03:02:59.285]  I mean, it's like, we think we're losing.
[03:02:59.505 --> 03:03:01.287]  We're starting World War III and all I'm getting is love.
[03:03:01.687 --> 03:03:05.928]  Because you're speaking the truth and the truth is the greatest.
[03:03:06.148 --> 03:03:06.988]  Truth is God.
[03:03:07.048 --> 03:03:08.429]  That's what God is, is truth.
[03:03:09.009 --> 03:03:12.870]  And so it's magnetizing and people hear it and they're like, what?
[03:03:13.190 --> 03:03:14.350]  Because they never hear it.
[03:03:14.891 --> 03:03:16.751]  You're speaking it and it's a magnet.
[03:03:16.851 --> 03:03:18.451]  It's the most powerful magnet.
[03:03:18.632 --> 03:03:19.012]  Exactly.
[03:03:19.032 --> 03:03:20.252]  So it shows the awakenings here.
[03:03:21.255 --> 03:03:22.016]  Everybody's awake.
[03:03:22.116 --> 03:03:24.138]  I mean the people that aren't awake.
[03:03:24.198 --> 03:03:47.364]   It's because they're not meant to be awake So just leave them you got to just leave them at a certain point because that's how God wants it if he if You know if they're not awake yet and after today I hope a whole lot more of them awaken, but if they don't then just leave them and Not everybody can go, Alex.
[03:03:47.504 --> 03:03:47.964]  I totally agree.
[03:03:47.984 --> 03:03:48.965]  Let me ask this question then.
[03:03:49.585 --> 03:04:05.033]  What happens, I'm worried about once this chain reaction goes complete, which is about halfway through right now, in my view, what do people, we don't want any violence, what do people, what happens when, which is happening in the next few months, when it tips totally towards us?
[03:04:05.954 --> 03:04:07.155]  What's the system going to do?
[03:04:07.535 --> 03:04:12.858]  What do we do once we know they killed us, they gave us poison shots, they attacked our children, they're child molesters?
[03:04:12.938 --> 03:04:14.979]  I mean, what do we do now?
[03:04:16.286 --> 03:04:20.970]  Well, a lot of people are talking about retribution, but I'd say we ain't got no time for that.
[03:04:21.070 --> 03:04:23.372]  What we have to do is rebuild immediately.
[03:04:23.852 --> 03:04:31.498]  And so I put a lot of thought into how we would rebuild so that we can save a lot of time, because we don't want a lot of our kids dying.
[03:04:31.538 --> 03:04:41.786]  And so I sort of did the work in 2012 of like reorganizing things around grandmas, because I figured out every grandma is pretty much responsible for about 100 people.
[03:04:44.224 --> 03:04:51.729]  And so, you know, we will have to reorganize our communities around, you know, every moral grandmother I'm talking about.
[03:04:51.749 --> 03:04:56.913]  Not some grandmas ain't good, you know, but grandparent is what I'm talking about.
[03:04:57.534 --> 03:04:57.894]  Elders.
[03:04:58.957 --> 03:05:06.804]  And we will have to organize our community first to take care of the children, make sure they're safe, that they're educated and fed.
[03:05:07.345 --> 03:05:09.567]  And that's, like, our priority, right?
[03:05:09.607 --> 03:05:10.267]  For this new world.
[03:05:10.287 --> 03:05:12.329]  Because the enemy's plan is to cut off the infrastructure.
[03:05:12.369 --> 03:05:13.190]  We've got to get ready now.
[03:05:13.450 --> 03:05:13.710]  Yeah.
[03:05:14.071 --> 03:05:14.711]  We have to have roads.
[03:05:16.820 --> 03:05:21.363]  We have to have muscle and we have a lot of teenage kids, a lot of boys.
[03:05:21.943 --> 03:05:25.105]  We have to have them as our muscle and they have to protect us.
[03:05:25.686 --> 03:05:27.687]  And we have to reinvent.
[03:05:27.707 --> 03:05:30.048]  So that's the attack on men.
[03:05:30.489 --> 03:05:37.453]  Yeah, they don't, they call it toxic masculinity, but that's the only thing that's ever saved us is masculinity.
[03:05:37.513 --> 03:05:38.354]  Are they kidding me?
[03:05:38.754 --> 03:05:41.916]  It really pisses me off that they're doing this to our boys.
[03:05:42.356 --> 03:05:52.519]   I have two sons and you know, It was hard to raise sons because you, you know, to see these women that they got a choice of is pretty bad.
[03:05:52.619 --> 03:06:02.521]  My one son that's here with me, he had, you know, some trouble with the women, you know, because, you know, we've got to raise women have to raise boys different.
[03:06:02.901 --> 03:06:07.842]  So I took my son over there to Jerusalem by the scruff of his effing neck.
[03:06:07.922 --> 03:06:10.423]  And I said, I want you to get over there for the wall there.
[03:06:11.286 --> 03:06:13.728]  I mean, I'm Jewish, so I'm just saying as a Jew, you know.
[03:06:14.148 --> 03:06:19.932]  So I says, you get over there to the wall and pray for a good Jewish wife to kick your ass into shape.
[03:06:20.513 --> 03:06:22.394]  That gets along with me, first of all.
[03:06:22.414 --> 03:06:23.115]  She's gorgeous.
[03:06:23.255 --> 03:06:24.215]  Great grandchild there.
[03:06:24.596 --> 03:06:31.821]  OK, so that's what he got, because I made him go over there and pray and get right with God and pray and ask for, you know, what he needed.
[03:06:31.941 --> 03:06:33.162]  Well, we come back.
[03:06:33.846 --> 03:06:35.227]  You know, I says, what'd you pray for?
[03:06:35.267 --> 03:06:37.429]  He goes, I pray for the Broncos to win.
[03:06:39.571 --> 03:06:41.092]  I said, it don't work like that.
[03:06:41.412 --> 03:06:42.794]  But anyway, we came back.
[03:06:43.314 --> 03:06:44.055]  Broncos lost.
[03:06:44.375 --> 03:06:46.797]  But we came back and look what happened.
[03:06:47.438 --> 03:06:52.882]   I mean, We have to raise our sons to get the right woman.
[03:06:53.602 --> 03:07:03.331]  And what they're doing to our boys is one thing, but what they're doing to our women, God Almighty, Alex, I'm so afraid for the women because look what they're out there doing.
[03:07:03.351 --> 03:07:04.112]  The women are the real power.
[03:07:04.232 --> 03:07:08.355]  The women, they got them so fucked up, Alex, they don't know what's coming or going.
[03:07:08.395 --> 03:07:09.616]  They're nothing but whores.
[03:07:10.017 --> 03:07:12.459]  They run out there- How about saying they take the system as their husband?
[03:07:13.081 --> 03:07:21.268]  Well, they're out there defending, to destroy the rights of women to bodily autonomy.
[03:07:21.728 --> 03:07:24.751]  That's what these young girls are out there going, no.
[03:07:25.512 --> 03:07:27.693]  We like men to come in our bathroom.
[03:07:27.854 --> 03:07:30.316]  I mean, that's what they got them brainwashed to that degree.
[03:07:30.716 --> 03:07:31.056]  Exactly.
[03:07:31.096 --> 03:07:36.281]  Their husband, I see Gillette ads where, pull up the Gillette ad, I guess it talks about selenity, three years ago.
[03:07:36.841 --> 03:07:40.885]  Gillette has ads where a guy asking a girl out at a movie theater is rape.
[03:07:41.545 --> 03:07:44.486]  But if a pedophile wants to come talk to your kids at school, that's good.
[03:07:45.006 --> 03:07:46.667]  I know, it's pedo law.
[03:07:47.047 --> 03:07:49.108]  That's what I defined it as a long time ago.
[03:07:49.168 --> 03:07:53.650]  When everything's run by pedophiles and they make the law, check it out.
[03:07:55.270 --> 03:08:07.155]  In the course of this country, if a woman accused her husband of being a pedophile, which a lot of them did for no reason and put a lot of good men in jail, we all know that because it's all effed.
[03:08:08.115 --> 03:08:10.696]  It's all screwed and they don't have the right data.
[03:08:10.716 --> 03:08:13.357]  They're not even going by data, they're going by emotion.
[03:08:13.898 --> 03:08:25.342]  But a lot of judges, if it was true, and they saw that it was true, and they saw the data on the kid being abused, they called the woman crazy and gave custody to the abusive father.
[03:08:25.382 --> 03:08:28.044]  There's a lot of those stories on both sides.
[03:08:28.444 --> 03:08:35.847]  So that proves to me that it's people who don't care and whatever money Greece, the pedos have a lot of money.
[03:08:37.453 --> 03:08:39.494]  You know that stuff about Boys Town.
[03:08:39.714 --> 03:08:40.854]  Oh yeah?
[03:08:40.974 --> 03:08:46.995]  They say that Boys Town and everything that happened there is the archetype for this whole government now.
[03:08:47.515 --> 03:08:48.876]  Well that's right, you're talking about Omaha, Nebraska.
[03:08:49.496 --> 03:08:49.676]  Yeah.
[03:08:49.696 --> 03:08:51.236]  And then you've got Penn State.
[03:08:52.436 --> 03:08:53.517]  Look at Penn State!
[03:08:55.797 --> 03:08:59.098]  That's where they brought the Nazis, Operation Paperclip.
[03:09:01.209 --> 03:09:04.352]  It's all like the same money, the same people.
[03:09:05.033 --> 03:09:05.673]  Few hands.
[03:09:06.013 --> 03:09:07.134]  Few hands.
[03:09:07.475 --> 03:09:09.216]  This spider spins the same web though.
[03:09:09.877 --> 03:09:10.878]  That's why we can beat it.
[03:09:11.656 --> 03:09:17.199]  That is right, because basically I figured out it's 2,500 people against, what, a billion?
[03:09:17.399 --> 03:09:18.659]  I agree with you.
[03:09:18.699 --> 03:09:20.560]  There's a couple hundred globalists and there are millions.
[03:09:20.580 --> 03:09:21.240]  A couple thousand.
[03:09:21.641 --> 03:09:23.261]  Well, you know, I had Henry Kissinger try to hire me.
[03:09:23.281 --> 03:09:23.962]  He tried to get me.
[03:09:24.482 --> 03:09:27.483]  It's the only time I've told a story, because he did it in front of my producer, John Harmon.
[03:09:28.123 --> 03:09:29.424]  Because I'll have meetings with these guys.
[03:09:29.464 --> 03:09:30.124]  They're off record.
[03:09:30.645 --> 03:09:31.805]  As a journalist, I've got to wear that hat.
[03:09:31.825 --> 03:09:34.566]  Unless it's criminal what they're saying, you know, it's off record.
[03:09:35.147 --> 03:09:40.523]   I had meetings with You know, Fox News people and, you know, all the rest of them.
[03:09:40.963 --> 03:09:44.685]  But with Kissinger, he said to have the Kissinger group talk to me.
[03:09:45.605 --> 03:09:48.467]  And they said, listen, you need to come join us.
[03:09:48.487 --> 03:09:49.467]  You get how it works.
[03:09:49.887 --> 03:09:50.808]  You'll have a seat at the table.
[03:09:50.848 --> 03:09:54.009]  You won't get all the power, but at least have your voice being heard.
[03:09:54.749 --> 03:09:56.890]  And that's basically what they told me.
[03:09:56.950 --> 03:10:07.682]   So that's why it's so frustrating for the general audience to understand It's not like some big bonus point I make this, but I mean, I could have worked for them, and most people do do that.
[03:10:08.142 --> 03:10:14.646]  But who would want to work for something, like you said it earlier, how does a billionaire spend their money when the civilization's collapsing?
[03:10:15.206 --> 03:10:20.149]  Why would you, like Henry Ford was a weirdo, and supported the Nazis, and was crazy.
[03:10:20.690 --> 03:10:27.854]  But he also was smart in ways, he said, they said, Henry Ford, why do you pay your factory workers in Detroit, Michigan, three times than anybody else does?
[03:10:27.874 --> 03:10:30.436]  He goes, there's not a market for my cars.
[03:10:31.198 --> 03:10:32.139]  Right, exactly.
[03:10:33.319 --> 03:10:35.521]  That's real capitalism, though.
[03:10:35.741 --> 03:10:37.442]  That's not crony capitalism.
[03:10:37.522 --> 03:10:37.662]  Exactly.
[03:10:37.682 --> 03:10:38.762]  That's what we got, right?
[03:10:39.183 --> 03:10:43.966]  We don't have real capitalism where there's like, what do they call it, supply and demand.
[03:10:44.006 --> 03:10:44.946]  They're none of that shit.
[03:10:44.986 --> 03:10:49.569]  That's why they'll make eight million little peanuts with a wind-up thing in it.
[03:10:49.969 --> 03:10:51.330]  It isn't supply and demand.
[03:10:51.390 --> 03:10:52.991]  It's crony capitalism.
[03:10:54.059 --> 03:10:58.561]  And that's what they, you know, then we can go talk about Marx and all that stuff.
[03:10:58.601 --> 03:11:02.323]  But anyway, you know, we'll spin out of control.
[03:11:02.343 --> 03:11:03.323]  No, do ten minutes more.
[03:11:03.343 --> 03:11:03.924]  I'm going to shut up.
[03:11:04.264 --> 03:11:05.544]  This is a historic interview.
[03:11:05.564 --> 03:11:06.605]  You made amazing points.
[03:11:06.625 --> 03:11:08.566]  I hope it's the first of many interviews.
[03:11:09.426 --> 03:11:10.046]  Oh, I love you.
[03:11:10.106 --> 03:11:10.827]  I'd love to come back.
[03:11:10.847 --> 03:11:12.167]  We were talking like three, four years ago.
[03:11:12.207 --> 03:11:12.708]  I know.
[03:11:12.968 --> 03:11:13.728]  You're going to come on.
[03:11:13.748 --> 03:11:14.468]  We're going to come on.
[03:11:14.589 --> 03:11:15.249]  I'm glad it happened.
[03:11:15.609 --> 03:11:16.109]  Why now?
[03:11:16.329 --> 03:11:17.530]  Is the planets aligned?
[03:11:18.311 --> 03:11:30.082]  Yeah, it was a great alignment last Wednesday where Jupiter, which I spelled J-E-W-P-I-T-E-R as a joke, but Jupiter aligned with Venus and just before Purim.
[03:11:30.302 --> 03:11:32.264]  So to me, that's a lot of stuff.
[03:11:32.324 --> 03:11:34.846]  That's a lot of female divine energy.
[03:11:35.424 --> 03:11:53.448]  And I think that's what we're entering into, a time where mothers are going to matter more than they ever have before, because they're going to realize that, you know, we have a lot to say, we have a lot to change, we have to raise our children better, and we have to be in a world where we're more protected instead of prey.
[03:11:53.468 --> 03:11:55.789]  By the way, let's talk paradox.
[03:11:56.229 --> 03:11:59.570]  The left claims they're empowering women because the women have the power, they want to control women.
[03:11:59.930 --> 03:12:01.090]  I agree, women are the answer.
[03:12:01.710 --> 03:12:03.171]  But not the way the system says.
[03:12:03.371 --> 03:12:07.114]  No, the way they're using women is against women.
[03:12:07.274 --> 03:12:11.417]  It's like women are the ultimate power against women in the wrong hands.
[03:12:12.097 --> 03:12:17.040]  When women aren't working for women and children, then that's a bad world.
[03:12:17.120 --> 03:12:20.743]  When women are working for women and children, that's a good world.
[03:12:20.763 --> 03:12:21.924]  Exactly, so I'm not an astronomer.
[03:12:22.504 --> 03:12:23.305]  I'm not an astronomer.
[03:12:24.322 --> 03:12:32.346]  Well, in Judaism, we look at the entire cosmos as God's creation to us that we are to honor.
[03:12:32.386 --> 03:12:34.627]  We don't look at it as like devil stuff.
[03:12:34.727 --> 03:12:35.367]  It's a clock.
[03:12:35.867 --> 03:12:36.608]  It is a clock.
[03:12:36.668 --> 03:12:40.189]  Have you been to Prague and seen that clock in Prague?
[03:12:40.269 --> 03:12:41.750]  The Jewish clock?
[03:12:41.830 --> 03:12:42.030]  I have.
[03:12:43.027 --> 03:12:43.587]  That's it.
[03:12:43.848 --> 03:12:44.288]  Exactly.
[03:12:44.308 --> 03:12:44.868]  That's what happened.
[03:12:45.489 --> 03:12:46.690]  I go to Cancun for a week.
[03:12:46.810 --> 03:12:49.332]  Spend time with my parents who are getting old and family because I haven't done it.
[03:12:49.712 --> 03:12:51.293]  I'm trying to like compress things that I haven't done.
[03:12:51.353 --> 03:12:51.773]  I'm guilty.
[03:12:51.833 --> 03:12:55.316]  I've been absent in many ways from my family for 20 something years.
[03:12:55.876 --> 03:12:59.039]  So at least four or five days a month now I take off to be with family.
[03:12:59.719 --> 03:13:02.001]  And so family goes to bed about 10 o'clock at night.
[03:13:02.141 --> 03:13:06.204]  I go on the balcony of this hotel and I look up and there's the moon.
[03:13:07.827 --> 03:13:09.308]  And I'm sitting there and I go, what's that?
[03:13:09.608 --> 03:13:11.130]  It's like a red light right next to it.
[03:13:11.610 --> 03:13:14.813]  There's another light and my eyes can look at it because I do have a telescope.
[03:13:14.833 --> 03:13:15.453]  I used to look at it.
[03:13:16.014 --> 03:13:16.574]  I go, wait a minute.
[03:13:16.794 --> 03:13:19.216]  So I look on my phone and it was all conjunct.
[03:13:19.697 --> 03:13:23.079]  It was like three planets around the moon lined up and I could see them.
[03:13:23.119 --> 03:13:25.001]  Like you were just saying, it was crazy.
[03:13:25.761 --> 03:13:27.743]  So much of it is about the planets.
[03:13:27.843 --> 03:13:30.886]  Like, you know, when they talk about the three wise men and that.
[03:13:30.946 --> 03:13:32.167]  Yeah, they were following that light.
[03:13:32.307 --> 03:13:32.607]  Right.
[03:13:33.127 --> 03:13:33.668]  It is about.
[03:13:36.053 --> 03:13:38.254]  So much of Revelations is about that, too.
[03:13:38.654 --> 03:13:43.836]  When they talk about the woman giving birth and the whole thing, that's the alignment we're in right now.
[03:13:44.356 --> 03:13:45.757]  So it is the end of... Well, roll with it.
[03:13:45.777 --> 03:13:46.277]  You got the floor.
[03:13:46.297 --> 03:13:46.737]  Tell us about it.
[03:13:47.278 --> 03:13:48.878]  Well, it is... You're a smart lady.
[03:13:48.918 --> 03:13:49.438]  Discourage it all.
[03:13:49.458 --> 03:13:49.899]  I'm going to shut up.
[03:13:50.179 --> 03:13:58.462]  Well, it is the end of times, and some people are saying, oh, that means the end of days, and that's what people are saying, oh, it's the end of the world.
[03:13:58.782 --> 03:14:00.243]  Well, it's not the end of the world.
[03:14:00.443 --> 03:14:05.365]   It's, to me, what it means is It's the end of the old.
[03:14:05.545 --> 03:14:10.886]  And the old has a lot of, you know, stuff that doesn't serve us anymore.
[03:14:10.926 --> 03:14:12.267]  A lot of it is... Exactly.
[03:14:12.287 --> 03:14:15.107]  So they're offering AI and all this BS because they're old.
[03:14:15.408 --> 03:14:16.748]  They're trying to act like they're the future.
[03:14:16.768 --> 03:14:17.148]  They're not.
[03:14:17.388 --> 03:14:22.870]  Well, they want to keep that Babylonian child sacrifice going because that's how they keep their power.
[03:14:22.990 --> 03:14:23.590]  Secrecy.
[03:14:24.090 --> 03:14:26.971]  You know, when you said secrets, that's how they keep it.
[03:14:27.171 --> 03:14:28.511]  Blackmail and secrets.
[03:14:28.912 --> 03:14:30.172]  That's how they keep their power.
[03:14:30.632 --> 03:14:31.513]  But I said I'd shut up.
[03:14:31.533 --> 03:14:31.974]  I interrupted.
[03:14:31.994 --> 03:14:32.374]  Start over.
[03:14:32.714 --> 03:14:36.619]  So you're, you're, you're, it's the old is ending, the new's coming in.
[03:14:36.639 --> 03:14:48.451]  Yeah, the old, including all the evil of, you know, the pyramid of child sacrifice and suffering of the people, the serfs, you know, what they're trying to do is bring back feudalism.
[03:14:48.532 --> 03:14:51.375]  That's what they're, that's what the one world thing is, feudalism.
[03:14:51.795 --> 03:14:55.076]  With the few at the top of the pyramid at the expense of the many.
[03:14:55.476 --> 03:15:07.499]  But see, the grand alignment is, that's God talking to us about, now you have the power because everything is on your side to not live in the pyramid at the bottom anymore.
[03:15:08.079 --> 03:15:16.061]  No, you don't need to do that because you have, you know, all you need to do is just, as I say, nothing.
[03:15:16.901 --> 03:15:20.524]  All's we need to do is nothing and this time it's going to serve us.
[03:15:20.944 --> 03:15:22.365]  It never served us before.
[03:15:22.385 --> 03:15:22.766]  I agree.
[03:15:22.786 --> 03:15:24.067]  We don't need military coups.
[03:15:24.087 --> 03:15:25.328]  We don't need violent action.
[03:15:25.348 --> 03:15:26.649]  Make it hurt the earth.
[03:15:28.277 --> 03:15:29.238]  That's what he meant.
[03:15:29.418 --> 03:15:32.240]  And this is the time that he said, you know, there's book.
[03:15:33.140 --> 03:15:35.082]  This is the thing that's going to happen, Alex.
[03:15:36.002 --> 03:15:39.184]  All the bullshit is going to fade and burn away.
[03:15:39.524 --> 03:15:40.045]  It is now.
[03:15:40.585 --> 03:15:41.105]  It is now.
[03:15:41.126 --> 03:15:42.586]  We're just now catching fire.
[03:15:42.767 --> 03:15:43.387]  Yes, it is.
[03:15:43.487 --> 03:15:46.109]  The sparks have caught fire and it's all burning away.
[03:15:46.449 --> 03:15:49.571]  The old is going to go and the new is just being born.
[03:15:49.671 --> 03:15:55.715]  And what's going to happen is that the writings of Jesus that people don't know about and they've tried to destroy for 2000 years.
[03:15:57.296 --> 03:15:58.457]  They tried to bury it.
[03:15:58.558 --> 03:15:59.959]  They tried to silence him.
[03:16:00.019 --> 03:16:02.442]  They tried to, you know, everything they've done to him.
[03:16:02.482 --> 03:16:05.705]  But people know in their hearts that what he spoke was true.
[03:16:06.085 --> 03:16:06.986]  It's going to come now.
[03:16:07.066 --> 03:16:07.887]  It's going to bloom.
[03:16:07.927 --> 03:16:10.430]  And everybody's going to read it and see it for themselves.
[03:16:11.090 --> 03:16:16.996]  And, you know, when I was three, I was told that I would be one who would talk about it.
[03:16:17.056 --> 03:16:20.260]  And I've studied it for 70 years, and I'm ready to do so.
[03:16:20.700 --> 03:16:27.805]  And so are a lot of other people, and it's time that people really knew who he was and what he did, but they don't know.
[03:16:28.445 --> 03:16:29.406]  They really don't know.
[03:16:29.426 --> 03:16:34.069]  What do the globalists do as they know they're losing?
[03:16:35.523 --> 03:16:40.624]  They step aside, make room for, you know, a soul, a real soul to take their place.
[03:16:41.104 --> 03:16:44.165]  And the people own the means of production of everything.
[03:16:44.565 --> 03:16:45.885]  Not the communist way.
[03:16:46.906 --> 03:16:47.886]  Not that crap.
[03:16:47.946 --> 03:16:51.867]  Because that's just, that's, that's still oppressive.
[03:16:51.887 --> 03:16:56.468]  Well notice how we have corporate using communism to seize control of production.
[03:16:56.548 --> 03:16:56.968]  It's a fraud.
[03:16:57.648 --> 03:17:05.270]  Corporatism and all that stuff is against tribal people's rights, and starting with the Jews in Jerusalem and Judea.
[03:17:05.751 --> 03:17:11.552]  They don't want nobody to live over their own sacred burial grounds and to be in touch with the past.
[03:17:11.712 --> 03:17:15.814]  They don't want ancestors, that whole... What about genetic memories?
[03:17:16.074 --> 03:17:17.554]  What about epigenetics exactly?
[03:17:17.574 --> 03:17:22.436]  It's not just instincts, we have the memories of our forebears, because they live on through us.
[03:17:23.018 --> 03:17:29.202]  We have it in our blood and our DNA, and that's what all their cloning and shit like that, their DNA studies is to alter.
[03:17:29.242 --> 03:17:30.003]  You know, the Nazis.
[03:17:30.023 --> 03:17:32.424]  That's why all the clones are retarded, because they don't have the spirit.
[03:17:32.744 --> 03:17:33.125]  That's right.
[03:17:33.145 --> 03:17:38.088]  They don't know nothing about the human soul or the human spirit, and they never will because they ain't got it.
[03:17:38.788 --> 03:17:40.329]  So that's our weapon, Alex.
[03:17:40.409 --> 03:17:42.651]  That and joy and the love for each other.
[03:17:43.131 --> 03:17:45.032]  And you started the interview with that before we went live.
[03:17:45.052 --> 03:17:45.392]  Talk about joy.
[03:17:45.432 --> 03:17:49.295]  And growing decent food to eat and share with our fellows.
[03:17:49.475 --> 03:17:50.636]  Talk about what Satan hates, joy.
[03:17:51.904 --> 03:17:55.901]  Oh yeah, that's the one thing he hates is, uh, well he hates us.
[03:17:56.917 --> 03:17:58.578]  Loving each other and loving God.
[03:17:58.678 --> 03:17:59.419]  He hates that.
[03:17:59.479 --> 03:18:00.980]  He hates when we are fearless.
[03:18:01.580 --> 03:18:03.021]  And he hates when we have joy.
[03:18:03.262 --> 03:18:05.143]  He recoils from joy.
[03:18:05.523 --> 03:18:12.028]  He recoils from love, joy, empathy, and faith in God.
[03:18:12.048 --> 03:18:14.790]  He can't exist nowhere where that does.
[03:18:15.150 --> 03:18:16.831]  He'll run like hell for the hills.
[03:18:17.572 --> 03:18:27.610]   And when he starved, we say, he starved through Good action towards our fellows and our sisters.
[03:18:28.131 --> 03:18:34.915]  He starved of his life force, which is fear, hatred, separatism, and division.
[03:18:35.156 --> 03:18:37.217]  That's what feeds him and makes him strong.
[03:18:37.277 --> 03:18:42.561]  Plus secrets and blackmail, you know, of the shit they make people do to get power.
[03:18:42.881 --> 03:18:44.382]  There's not a one of them sitting there.
[03:18:45.359 --> 03:18:47.540]  Well, I can think of two or three that I know.
[03:18:47.660 --> 03:18:48.961]  Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[03:18:49.041 --> 03:18:49.621]  I love her.
[03:18:49.641 --> 03:18:51.222]  She's a great lady.
[03:18:51.402 --> 03:18:52.983]  I believe that she's got a soul.
[03:18:53.003 --> 03:18:54.544]  A few of them do now.
[03:18:55.164 --> 03:18:59.687]  But anyway, it don't matter even if there was a hundred good ones.
[03:18:59.747 --> 03:19:10.533]  The system is so rotten, it needs to be flushed out and returned to its source, which is the great Constitution written by our forefathers.
[03:19:10.593 --> 03:19:12.474]  So will there be nuclear war or what happens in Russia?
[03:19:13.260 --> 03:19:15.661]  Well, they want that, I think.
[03:19:15.861 --> 03:19:28.645]  I think they want limited nuclear war, yeah, and they're all geared up for it, and that's why I'm praying that all that shit fails, and that God will move his hand among us, and that we, the people, will stimulate him.
[03:19:28.665 --> 03:19:30.265]  A few political questions.
[03:19:30.285 --> 03:19:31.226]  Do you like Trump or DeSantis?
[03:19:32.766 --> 03:19:34.467]  I don't like DeSantis at all.
[03:19:34.547 --> 03:19:37.748]  I think he's a Trojan horse for globalism.
[03:19:37.808 --> 03:19:38.648]  Soros loves him.
[03:19:39.892 --> 03:19:40.673]  Well, no, it's true.
[03:19:40.733 --> 03:19:43.094]  And like, they're trying to pass anti-free speech bills.
[03:19:45.296 --> 03:19:47.577]  I love what he did with Disney in Florida, though.
[03:19:48.258 --> 03:19:49.479]  He does some right things.
[03:19:49.799 --> 03:19:56.884]  He took away their special status where they can take, you know, they was taken, well, I shouldn't say, I don't want to get in trouble.
[03:19:57.064 --> 03:19:58.845]  No, they got their own little country going.
[03:19:58.905 --> 03:20:03.869]  So, no, I mean, at least Trump's anti-World War III.
[03:20:04.830 --> 03:20:10.132]  He's a peacemaker because he's intelligent, because anybody who's intelligent wants peace.
[03:20:10.592 --> 03:20:15.874]  This time on this planet ain't no time for effing around with lethal weapons.
[03:20:16.374 --> 03:20:17.555]  Everybody can see that.
[03:20:17.755 --> 03:20:22.377]  I mean, they could do something about birth control rather than trying to depopulate.
[03:20:22.497 --> 03:20:24.117]  What happens with Biden?
[03:20:24.577 --> 03:20:25.578]  Obviously, that guy's done.
[03:20:25.618 --> 03:20:26.258]  What do you think happens?
[03:20:26.818 --> 03:20:27.919]  Do you think that's Biden?
[03:20:28.839 --> 03:20:29.379]  No.
[03:20:29.959 --> 03:20:30.980]  What about the mayors?
[03:20:32.140 --> 03:20:33.941]  They ain't even the same guy, I don't think.
[03:20:34.961 --> 03:20:35.481]  I don't know.
[03:20:35.561 --> 03:20:36.521]  That's what people say.
[03:20:37.022 --> 03:20:40.623]  But I think Biden, this is Obama's third term.
[03:20:40.723 --> 03:20:42.223]  Obama's just the window puppet.
[03:20:42.243 --> 03:20:45.604]  But I mean, Biden's just the puppet of Obama.
[03:20:45.684 --> 03:20:50.045]  And as I say, Valerie Jarrett is Obama's brain.
[03:20:50.085 --> 03:20:51.465]  So this is her third term.
[03:20:51.505 --> 03:20:53.326]  And how you liking it, America?
[03:20:55.185 --> 03:20:55.425]  Wow.
[03:20:55.585 --> 03:20:57.907]  Well, Roseanne Barr, we've done a two-hour interview.
[03:20:57.987 --> 03:20:59.128]  It's been amazing.
[03:20:59.148 --> 03:21:04.471]  I want you to look inside your amazing mind in the last five minutes and have the floor.
[03:21:04.511 --> 03:21:06.112]  Anything else you want to add to the viewers and listeners?
[03:21:06.593 --> 03:21:07.773]  I said, how do people find you?
[03:21:07.894 --> 03:21:08.394]  I don't know.
[03:21:08.434 --> 03:21:08.774]  Whatever.
[03:21:09.254 --> 03:21:10.896]  Roseanne Barr, we're glad you're here.
[03:21:10.916 --> 03:21:12.517]  Anytime you want to come on here, we love you.
[03:21:12.537 --> 03:21:13.097]  Please come back.
[03:21:13.457 --> 03:21:14.298]  I love you, too.
[03:21:14.398 --> 03:21:15.399]  And I love all of you.
[03:21:15.419 --> 03:21:20.142]  And I guess I just want to say, don't give up now.
[03:21:20.202 --> 03:21:21.182]  We came this far.
[03:21:21.222 --> 03:21:21.903]  Don't give up.
[03:21:22.163 --> 03:21:22.904]  Get stronger.
[03:21:23.860 --> 03:21:29.106]  You know, nobody can stop you from getting better, from getting stronger in your body and your mind.
[03:21:29.126 --> 03:21:31.449]  No law, no government, nothing.
[03:21:31.769 --> 03:21:32.810]  That's what you need to do.
[03:21:33.251 --> 03:21:37.255]  And learn about growing your own food, your own vegetables.
[03:21:37.916 --> 03:21:39.778]  Do that as fast as possible.
[03:21:40.839 --> 03:21:41.560]  Well, you look great.
[03:21:41.580 --> 03:21:42.061]  You're doing good.
[03:21:43.194 --> 03:21:45.715]  You know, I really am.
[03:21:45.755 --> 03:22:03.764]  I'm a very lucky woman and, you know, I'm happy and I feel like, you know, I could use what time I have left in service of my beliefs.
[03:22:04.986 --> 03:22:05.947]  Hawaii's beautiful.
[03:22:06.048 --> 03:22:07.089]  I thought about trying to move there.
[03:22:07.169 --> 03:22:07.890]  I love Texas.
[03:22:07.910 --> 03:22:08.792]  You know I moved down there.
[03:22:08.852 --> 03:22:09.432]  I know what I'm saying.
[03:22:09.813 --> 03:22:10.254]  I love Hawaii.
[03:22:10.274 --> 03:22:11.115]  I don't have the money to move there.
[03:22:11.475 --> 03:22:13.158]  You moved outside of Austin to Texas.
[03:22:13.178 --> 03:22:13.779]  When did you do that?
[03:22:14.662 --> 03:22:16.124]  I did it about six months ago.
[03:22:16.224 --> 03:22:17.906]  By God, I just love it so much.
[03:22:18.346 --> 03:22:20.568]  I've never met nicer people in my life.
[03:22:21.269 --> 03:22:23.311]  Everywhere I go is nothing but love.
[03:22:23.632 --> 03:22:28.437]  And, you know, I just love everybody back so much.
[03:22:28.457 --> 03:22:32.622]  Well, I thought, paradoxically, growing up in Texas, everybody was like that going to other parts of the country.
[03:22:32.942 --> 03:22:35.685]  There's great folks all over, but man, real Texans are really good people.
[03:22:36.656 --> 03:22:39.718]  And they're strong, and they like liberty.
[03:22:41.780 --> 03:22:44.541]  I'll end with this quote from a friend of mine, Mary Daly.
[03:22:44.962 --> 03:22:48.004]  She said, there is no liberty without truth.
[03:22:49.365 --> 03:22:51.766]  I think I like to end on that all the time.
[03:22:51.906 --> 03:22:52.247]  Beautiful.
[03:22:52.267 --> 03:22:54.908]  Let me read an Alexander Solzhenitsyn quote I mentioned earlier.
[03:22:56.690 --> 03:23:16.271]   And how we burn to the camps later, thinking what would things have been like If every security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad,
[03:23:17.267 --> 03:23:59.379]   When they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, hauling with terror, every bang on the downstairs door and every step on the staircase, but understood that they had nothing left to lose, nothing left to lose, and had boldly set up with axes, hammers, pokers, whatever else they had, the organs would have quickly Have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the curse machine would have round to a halt if, if, if, if we didn't love freedom enough.
[03:24:01.081 --> 03:24:05.263]  And even more, we had no awareness of the real situation.
[03:24:05.784 --> 03:24:10.147]  It purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.
[03:24:10.981 --> 03:24:12.322]  It's time to make your choice.
[03:24:12.822 --> 03:24:19.208]  And I just pray for all the people who are going to make that choice and are going to be forced to make that choice.
[03:24:19.628 --> 03:24:23.351]  That you choose right and that you choose to be with the human beings.
[03:24:24.812 --> 03:24:25.793]  And I would close with that.
[03:24:25.833 --> 03:24:27.835]  That's so paradoxical, Roseanne.
[03:24:27.855 --> 03:24:28.495]  You're totally right.
[03:24:29.976 --> 03:24:34.000]  Going along with the New World Order will destroy you, will enslave you, will hurt your family.
[03:24:34.960 --> 03:24:39.322]  But you've got to have the moral courage to say no to it now and realize that and then we can stop this.
[03:24:39.822 --> 03:24:41.443]  We don't have to go down the same path.
[03:24:41.563 --> 03:24:49.607]  Albert Einstein said, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again with the same results but never stopping.
[03:24:50.147 --> 03:24:52.848]  To paraphrase it, we've got to say no now.
[03:24:53.309 --> 03:24:54.989]  We've got to stop complying.
[03:24:55.770 --> 03:24:57.350]  You're not going to save the world by yourself.
[03:24:57.411 --> 03:24:58.331]  Neither is Roseanne.
[03:24:58.391 --> 03:25:07.146]   Neither am I. But together, I like the thing when it occurred to me that all people have to do is nothing.
[03:25:07.967 --> 03:25:17.254]  That means when you've been agitated to take action, not just because they want to arrest you.
[03:25:18.570 --> 03:25:23.453]  It's because they are watching you and they are manipulating you and they are moving you.
[03:25:23.593 --> 03:25:24.553]  Everything they're doing.
[03:25:25.174 --> 03:25:28.876]  It's better just to take 10 deep breaths and do nothing.
[03:25:28.956 --> 03:25:29.936]  Don't be pushed.
[03:25:30.397 --> 03:25:33.759]  Just stay home and do nothing because it will fall faster.
[03:25:36.000 --> 03:25:36.460]  Powerful.
[03:25:37.160 --> 03:25:38.321]  Well, I'm going to end this interview.
[03:25:38.641 --> 03:25:39.782]  Two plus hour live.
[03:25:39.802 --> 03:25:40.883]  Anything else you want to add?
[03:25:41.623 --> 03:25:43.164]  Just God bless America.
[03:25:44.554 --> 03:25:44.814]  Wow.
[03:25:44.974 --> 03:25:46.535]  Well, God bless Roseanne.
[03:25:47.056 --> 03:25:48.857]  We really appreciate you being here with us.
[03:25:49.437 --> 03:25:51.899]  And God bless everybody else that's been fighting tyranny.
[03:25:53.280 --> 03:25:56.022]  Roseanne Barr, where should people go to find you?
[03:25:56.162 --> 03:25:56.783]  You got a website?
[03:25:57.443 --> 03:26:00.025]  Well, I'm over there on YouTube someplace.
[03:26:00.305 --> 03:26:02.627]  I'm on Twitter on these fake accounts.
[03:26:03.227 --> 03:26:04.848]  One of them's called Rosie Posey.
[03:26:04.868 --> 03:26:05.889]  All right.
[03:26:06.169 --> 03:26:09.411]  Because Elon hasn't reinstated you yet, because you talk about George Clooney.
[03:26:09.431 --> 03:26:12.894]  Well, because my kids are the ones that took it away, and they won't give me my password.
[03:26:15.069 --> 03:26:15.369]  Really?
[03:26:15.569 --> 03:26:16.110]  Yeah.
[03:26:16.130 --> 03:26:19.511]  Three of my kids are real liberals, and they won't give me my password.
[03:26:19.611 --> 03:26:20.632]  Wow, they were gonna protect you.
[03:26:21.372 --> 03:26:24.174]  They think so, but it's like, come on, y'all.
[03:26:24.943 --> 03:26:26.223]  Well, they're not soliciting you now.
[03:26:26.243 --> 03:26:27.824]  This is going to be a big interview.
[03:26:28.284 --> 03:26:29.484]  I hope listeners will take this.
[03:26:29.564 --> 03:26:34.505]  My family sees that I went on Alex Jones, the liberals, because my family is nothing but libtards.
[03:26:35.005 --> 03:26:38.566]  My brother's a professor at Berkeley, for Christ's sake.
[03:26:39.086 --> 03:26:39.986]  That's a liberal.
[03:26:40.066 --> 03:26:41.847]  Well, while you're here, we're going to get a late lunch.
[03:26:41.867 --> 03:26:43.687]  They're going to shit theirself.
[03:26:44.307 --> 03:26:47.568]  Give us a little bit of your new comedy routine and talk to your family.
[03:26:47.628 --> 03:26:48.048]  Hit them hard.
[03:26:49.288 --> 03:26:50.609]  You know, I told you so.
[03:26:50.769 --> 03:26:56.032]  I told you so for 20 effing years and I was right every time and you know it.
[03:26:56.512 --> 03:26:57.773]  You know everything I say.
[03:26:57.873 --> 03:26:58.753]  I don't lie.
[03:26:58.773 --> 03:27:01.514]  You know, I have a disorder.
[03:27:01.955 --> 03:27:04.056]  I have multiple personality disorder.
[03:27:04.356 --> 03:27:07.498]  So the only way I can deal with it is by absolute truth.
[03:27:07.918 --> 03:27:10.079]  I can't lie because I'll forget, you know?
[03:27:10.856 --> 03:27:13.638]  You know, I can't bullshit, because I won't remember.
[03:27:14.138 --> 03:27:16.519]  All's I can do is talk the truth.
[03:27:16.759 --> 03:27:17.880]  And sometimes I'm wrong.
[03:27:17.920 --> 03:27:18.800]  I'm not saying I'm wrong.
[03:27:19.221 --> 03:27:23.183]  But also, because I have multiple personality disorder.
[03:27:23.203 --> 03:27:24.684]  Well, that's their false definition, though.
[03:27:25.104 --> 03:27:25.524]  I know.
[03:27:25.624 --> 03:27:26.585]  They're all full of shit.
[03:27:27.245 --> 03:27:28.166]  But I'm always right.
[03:27:28.366 --> 03:27:31.707]  And, you know, they'll sometimes go, you called that one right.
[03:27:32.048 --> 03:27:33.769]  How about I called all of it right?
[03:27:33.909 --> 03:27:37.811]  But anyway, part of having MPD is you do have foresight.
[03:27:39.505 --> 03:27:44.750]  Like you were saying, you see things... Well, in every culture, they always thought the lunatic was the shaman.
[03:27:45.210 --> 03:27:47.873]  Well, you know what Judaism says?
[03:27:47.893 --> 03:27:50.976]  This is a good one.
[03:27:51.356 --> 03:28:01.365]  In these days, which is called the age of Aquarius, in the age of Aquarius, only the voice of the insane and the drunkard can be trusted.
[03:28:01.765 --> 03:28:03.067]  And luckily, I'm bald.
[03:28:05.737 --> 03:28:07.318]  All right, well, powerful interview.
[03:28:07.338 --> 03:28:08.099]  Will you come back soon?
[03:28:08.339 --> 03:28:09.160]  I love it, Alex.
[03:28:09.240 --> 03:28:09.740]  I loved it.
[03:28:09.760 --> 03:28:10.581]  This is going to go viral.
[03:28:10.601 --> 03:28:11.782]  This is going to be all over the news.
[03:28:13.463 --> 03:28:16.025]  Well, Godspeed from your voice to God's ear.
[03:28:16.086 --> 03:28:17.347]  May it wake the people.
[03:28:17.747 --> 03:28:21.890]  May the people realize how much we love them and how much we do for them.
[03:28:22.391 --> 03:28:25.673]  And may comedy be king.
[03:28:25.733 --> 03:28:28.736]  And all the comics out there, keep on doing it.
[03:28:29.793 --> 03:28:30.113]  I agree.
[03:28:30.433 --> 03:28:31.474]  We get emails every day.
[03:28:31.534 --> 03:28:33.014]  Can we play your show?
[03:28:33.074 --> 03:28:33.914]  Can we take clips out?
[03:28:34.014 --> 03:28:34.995]  It's all free to air.
[03:28:35.015 --> 03:28:36.115]  Whatever you want with it.
[03:28:36.155 --> 03:28:36.996]  It's copyright free.
[03:28:37.396 --> 03:28:38.136]  Get this out, folks.
[03:28:38.176 --> 03:28:39.416]  I forgot to say one thing.
[03:28:39.456 --> 03:28:40.057]  Don't take your time.
[03:28:40.077 --> 03:28:40.277]  Go ahead.
[03:28:40.297 --> 03:28:40.937]  We're live still.
[03:28:40.977 --> 03:28:41.557]  Go for hours.
[03:28:41.717 --> 03:28:43.358]  You are funnier than shit.
[03:28:43.518 --> 03:28:45.578]  I just wanted to say how funny you are.
[03:28:45.598 --> 03:28:46.799]  What did you think was funny?
[03:28:47.399 --> 03:28:55.786]  Everything you do when you have... Some of the things you do when you're like... When you get hysterical, I love it so much.
[03:28:56.306 --> 03:28:59.308]  All the stuff they turn into memes is hilarious.
[03:28:59.789 --> 03:29:06.654]  And you're making your point with comedy and you don't... Nobody's really saying, what a great comic you are.
[03:29:06.874 --> 03:29:07.595]  Well, you're very sweet.
[03:29:08.235 --> 03:29:10.196]  What's a piece of, you like the Goblin comedy?
[03:29:10.897 --> 03:29:11.858]  I just like it all!
[03:29:12.338 --> 03:29:23.566]  I like it when you like go for broken, like, what do you call it, rant on a thing, and it's like so ridiculously brilliant that all you can do is just roar.
[03:29:23.786 --> 03:29:25.467]  You really have a comic's mind.
[03:29:26.068 --> 03:29:26.968]  Well, you're very sweet.
[03:29:27.409 --> 03:29:28.970]  Roseanne Barr, we really appreciate you.
[03:29:28.990 --> 03:29:29.850]  It's been an epic interview.
[03:29:30.151 --> 03:29:33.493]  I think we've gone two hours and ten minutes.
[03:29:33.513 --> 03:29:33.873]  Thank you.
[03:29:34.053 --> 03:29:34.694]  Thank you, honey.
[03:29:36.107 --> 03:29:38.088]  She'll be back soon, hopefully, fellow Texan.
[03:29:38.509 --> 03:29:39.329]  Great job, crew.
[03:29:39.849 --> 03:29:49.976]  Re-air this over and over again until... Until we find out that all the bombs and shit, for some reason, they just malfunctioned.
[03:29:50.296 --> 03:29:51.097]  Hopefully that's the case.
[03:29:51.117 --> 03:29:52.037]  4 p.m.
[03:29:52.057 --> 03:29:53.098]  tomorrow, Sunday show.
[03:29:52.938 --> 03:29:54.938]  I'll see you then.
[03:29:54.938 --> 03:29:58.417]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[03:29:58.417 --> 03:30:19.538]  I don't know, guys.
[03:30:19.483 --> 03:30:21.683]  Do you think the beard is intimidating?
[03:30:21.703 --> 03:30:23.104]  Do you think it's too much?
[03:30:24.524 --> 03:30:28.526]  Yeah, I mean, it looks pretty good, but... I don't know, it's just a beard.
[03:30:30.572 --> 03:30:32.253]  It's just not that intimidating, dude.
[03:30:32.813 --> 03:30:33.173]  Hmm.
[03:30:36.754 --> 03:30:37.735]  Just a beard, huh?
[03:30:38.675 --> 03:30:46.518]  What about... I gotta go to the bathroom.
[03:30:48.598 --> 03:30:49.939]  Dude, that's intimidating, man.
[03:30:50.799 --> 03:30:51.820]  That's frickin' awesome.
[03:30:52.240 --> 03:30:52.900]  You're on in five.
[03:30:57.455 --> 03:31:02.244]  Get your hair and beard formula at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:02.525 --> 03:31:03.366]  Sexy!
[03:31:03.727 --> 03:31:05.470]  And intimidating!
