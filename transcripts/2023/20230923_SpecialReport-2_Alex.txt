[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.170]  It's now mainstream news.
[00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.091]  Google has always been CIA.
[00:00:03.611 --> 00:00:04.992]  Set up by In-Q-Tel.
[00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.454]  IBM is a government front.
[00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:09.074]  Even pre-OSS.
[00:00:09.795 --> 00:00:11.336]  Microsoft is a government front.
[00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:16.639]  All these major corporations, the Fortune 100, are government fronts.
[00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:18.220]  Just like Hughes.
[00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:23.043]  Space and Aeronautics, it later came out, was a complete government front.
[00:00:23.603 --> 00:00:26.165]  It's all a government front.
[00:00:30.382 --> 00:00:33.624]  Michigan considers law to licensed journalist.
[00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:37.386]  This is in the Associated Press, Reuters, and Fox News.
[00:00:37.826 --> 00:00:40.948]  And what's scary is the media is reporting it like it's reasonable.
[00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.431]  And other states are moving as well to where I won't be able to be on the air.
[00:00:45.551 --> 00:00:47.132]  Now I have to have a government license.
[00:00:47.712 --> 00:00:48.813]  They have to approve.
[00:00:49.113 --> 00:00:55.237]  And that's what the New York Times and also many members of the White House, Obama czars, are saying.
[00:00:55.697 --> 00:00:56.738]  You have to be vetted.
[00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:06.784]  We have to decide, or we're going to put messages up on your website, government pop-ups, that say stuff isn't true, or that directs you to government or other media.
[00:01:07.765 --> 00:01:09.085]  Of course, that was in the news last week.
[00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:10.966]  We're kicking their hind ends.
[00:01:11.507 --> 00:01:15.729]  They are going to try this, so you better enjoy the internet while it's here.
[00:01:16.673 --> 00:01:29.500]  A new Chrome extension called NewsGuard claims to restore trust and accountability by telling you what websites are lying to you and which ones are telling the truth.
[00:01:30.828 --> 00:01:46.496]  They provide a NewsGuard shield displayed in the top of your Chrome browser that signals green if a website is trying to get it right, and red if it has an agenda or knowingly publishes falsehoods or propaganda.
[00:01:47.196 --> 00:01:54.780]  Interestingly enough, the NewsGuard shield shows red on every website that questions the establishment narrative.
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.505]  And shows green on every website that supports the establishment narrative.
[00:02:01.446 --> 00:02:12.278]  For example, establishment news site Forbes praises NewsGuard, saying, NewsGuard gets a leg up in the war on real fake news.
[00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.523]  And Forbes gets a green shield from NewsGuard.
[00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:25.984]  RT, a website that often questions the establishment narrative, posts an article that is critical of NewsGuard.
[00:02:27.104 --> 00:02:30.426]  And RT gets a red shield from NewsGuard.
[00:02:31.747 --> 00:02:42.674]  This is so extreme, so naked in its tyranny and its illegality, that it boggles the mind that this is being done out in the open.
[00:02:43.857 --> 00:02:52.799]  Remember just three and a half years ago, Bush was getting up at press conferences saying, I promise we're not spying on American people without warrants.
[00:02:53.399 --> 00:03:06.702]  And then just a month later it came out that the NSA had giant snooping hubs in every major telecommunications facility and that all communications are being run through these different forms of keyword software.
[00:03:07.657 --> 00:03:32.654]  And that these different files and algorithms and relationship actuaries of how different groups of people interact with each other, how corporations interact with each other, to really be able to understand trends in society so that the insiders literally have a crystal ball type effect to be able to manipulate and control society.
[00:03:33.094 --> 00:03:37.157]  And it's an unfair trade advantage against competitors to the globalist.
[00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:39.859]  Whether it's private, corporate, or government.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.981]  And of course, it's all completely illegal.
[00:03:43.782 --> 00:03:52.008]  And it's the same thing with InfraGard and the Total Information Awareness Network, known as the Top Secret USA Report.
[00:03:52.829 --> 00:04:14.413]   And they have come out and admitted that private contractors by the hundreds of thousands in IT alone have been given total power to violate all of your privacy and all of your rights and to hack people's computers and to dial into the computer networks and to control everything.
[00:04:15.334 --> 00:04:26.741]  And the media is spinning this like, oh, they're these great little heroes and we hope they don't get in trouble from the government when they go on to admit that the former director of the NSA runs this program.
[00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:32.754]  Remember when the Total Information Awareness Network was exposed in 2002?
[00:04:33.834 --> 00:04:41.376]  That a government agency was data mining all of your data and surveilling everything you do with the convicted felon, Admiral Poindexter.
[00:04:43.596 --> 00:04:52.138]  And then it came out in the news that, oh, now they've moved into private offices around the country and they're using private contractors to do it.
[00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:54.979]  That's the key here.
[00:04:56.283 --> 00:05:04.149]  It's the unelected, corporate infiltrated and controlled private bureaucracy being given government power.
[00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:16.878]  And you've got all these yuppies and people on incredible power trips as the Pentagon admits they are converting massive resources over to quote cyber war.
[00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:23.757]  And Cass Sunstein at the White House and others, the Pentagon admits, it is war against the American people.
[00:05:23.857 --> 00:05:27.259]  It is info war using lies and deception.
[00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:30.980]  So here is Forbes today.
[00:05:32.361 --> 00:05:36.442]  Stealthy government contractor monitors U.S.
[00:05:36.562 --> 00:05:39.003]  internet providers worked with WikiLeaks.
[00:05:40.704 --> 00:05:50.169]   And the article is tailored, total psyop, Andy Greenberg is who wrote this to just come out and make it sound like they're heroes.
[00:05:52.523 --> 00:06:20.424]   And it says a semi-secret government contractor that calls itself Project Vigilant surfaced, we've covered it before, at the DEF CON Security Conference Sunday with a series of revelations that it monitors the traffic of twelve regional internet service providers, the main hubs, hands much of the information to federal agencies, and encourages one of its volunteers, researchers, they always say that for, you know, these are spies for A membrane between them and the government of separation.
[00:06:20.785 --> 00:06:33.592]  Researcher Adrian Lamo to inform the federal government about the alleged source of the controversial video of civilian deaths in Iraq leaked a whistleblower site WikiLeaks in April.
[00:06:33.933 --> 00:06:34.693]  And what does it say?
[00:06:35.153 --> 00:06:52.982]   This private group created by the NSA and headed up by the former head of the NSA, that's at the end of the article, you know later they tell you that, It says it's tracking all of our IPs, 250 million a day, in the US, live time, everything you're doing.
[00:06:53.082 --> 00:06:56.787]  854,000 security clearances just in this area alone.
[00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:57.849]  Highest level.
[00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.451]  Totally illegal.
[00:07:02.253 --> 00:07:06.518]  And these are the type of people that were able to get into our YouTube account and take down the Obama deception.
[00:07:06.578 --> 00:07:09.061]  These are the type of people that take our videos off the front page.
[00:07:09.542 --> 00:07:17.431]  I mean, YouTube last year admitted that they follow the orders of Senator Lieberman's office, this was in the news, of what videos he says to take down.
[00:07:17.847 --> 00:07:21.429]  Listen to this, the ninth installment of the Twitter files have been released.
[00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:27.133]  This time, detailing how several government agencies interacted with the platform.
[00:07:27.553 --> 00:07:41.542]  Matt Taibbi saying, quote, the files show the FBI acting as doormen to a vast program of social media surveillance and censorship, encompassing agencies across the federal government from the State Department to the Pentagon to the CIA.
[00:07:42.543 --> 00:07:48.888]  Why do you think you or anyone else at Twitter had the medical expertise to censor a doctor's expert opinion?
[00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:56.934]  Our policies regarding COVID were designed to protect individuals.
[00:07:57.014 --> 00:08:07.662]  We were seeing... You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors, Stanford-educated doctors, doctors that are educated in the best places in the world, and you silenced those voices!
[00:08:08.602 --> 00:08:13.165]  I have another tweet by someone with a following of a full 18,000 followers.
[00:08:13.245 --> 00:08:17.428]  This person put a chart from the CDC on Twitter.
[00:08:17.588 --> 00:08:21.551]  It's the CDC's own data, so it's accurate by your standards.
[00:08:22.031 --> 00:08:24.313]  And you all labeled this as misleading.
[00:08:24.853 --> 00:08:26.114]  You're not a doctor, right Miss Gatti?
[00:08:27.952 --> 00:08:28.432]  No, I'm not.
[00:08:28.693 --> 00:08:28.993]  Okay.
[00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:36.699]  What makes you think you or anyone else at Twitter have the medical expertise to censor actual, accurate CDC data?
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.443]  There was a corrupt revolving door at the highest levels between the FBI and Twitter.
[00:08:41.944 --> 00:08:49.450]  Look no further than Jim Baker, former general counsel at the FBI who helped unlawfully investigate Donald Trump in the 2016 election.
[00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:55.195]  Or look at Jim Comey's deputy chief of staff who became the director of strategy at Twitter.
[00:08:55.795 --> 00:08:59.755]   Isn't it true according to the Twitter files that there were so many FBI
[00:08:59.755 --> 00:09:05.694]   officials who then went to work at Twitter that they created their own Slack channel and crib sheet
[00:09:05.694 --> 00:09:06.675]  for onboarding.
[00:09:06.675 --> 00:09:08.915]  The Twitter files confirm that, correct?
[00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:09.415]  Correct.
[00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:14.915]   Are you aware, as the American people are aware, that according to polling,
[00:09:14.915 --> 00:09:19.955]   of the people that were made aware of the Hunter Biden laptop story,
[00:09:19.955 --> 00:09:25.714]   53 percent would have changed their vote, including 61 percent of Democrats.
[00:09:26.577 --> 00:09:36.725]  This is the definition of election meddling, and it's the definition of election meddling by the FBI, on behalf of Democrats, paid for by the U.S.
[00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:37.485]  taxpayers.
[00:09:37.965 --> 00:09:41.488]  It's collusion, it's corruption, and it's unconstitutional.
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.881]  That Microsoft runs their censorship.
[00:09:46.181 --> 00:09:47.501]  Bill Gates a week and a half ago.
[00:09:47.541 --> 00:09:48.802]  Remember, in fact, pull this up.
[00:09:49.182 --> 00:09:51.562]  Bill Gates supports Chinese censorship.
[00:09:51.622 --> 00:09:52.142]  Pull that up.
[00:09:52.423 --> 00:09:54.423]  Bill Gates says Chinese censorship, good.
[00:09:55.423 --> 00:09:56.404]  They built the grid.
[00:09:56.424 --> 00:10:03.286]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, they are coming after the web in a big way all over the world in the last two weeks.
[00:10:03.346 --> 00:10:04.486]  It isn't just China.
[00:10:05.816 --> 00:10:09.778]  The White House in cyber security bill calls for a net ID.
[00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:16.262]  Notice for four years all the new Microsoft operating systems have built in a thumb scanner to be able to get online.
[00:10:17.063 --> 00:10:22.506]  Web censorship in China, not a problem says Bill Gates, London Guardian.
[00:10:22.786 --> 00:10:23.987]  See what I'm saying here?
[00:10:24.608 --> 00:10:26.109]  You say it can't happen here?
[00:10:26.629 --> 00:10:27.710]  It is happening here.
[00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.113]   Google, Yahoo, Microsoft!
[00:10:31.314 --> 00:10:33.255]  They've all helped China censor!
[00:10:33.695 --> 00:10:34.775]  It's now mainstream news.
[00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:36.676]  Google has always been CIA.
[00:10:37.217 --> 00:10:38.577]  Set up by In-Q-Tel.
[00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:41.039]  IBM is a government front.
[00:10:41.459 --> 00:10:42.620]  Even pre-OSS.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.941]  Microsoft is a government front.
[00:10:45.521 --> 00:10:50.164]  All these major corporations, the Fortune 100, are government fronts.
[00:10:50.604 --> 00:10:51.805]  Just like Hughes.
[00:10:53.485 --> 00:10:56.647]  Space and Aeronautics, it later came out, was a complete government front.
[00:10:57.006 --> 00:11:07.525]  It's all a government front.
[00:11:07.592 --> 00:11:09.432]  I've not been this excited ever!
[00:11:09.712 --> 00:11:12.013]  Yeah, Mud Club, baby!
[00:11:12.173 --> 00:11:12.994]  Wow!
[00:11:13.094 --> 00:11:15.595]  You know that you're part of history, bucking the system.
[00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:20.897]  Everybody needs to tell your friends, your family, your neighbors, hey, you want a second American Revolution?
[00:11:20.917 --> 00:11:21.897]  You don't like what's happening?
[00:11:22.117 --> 00:11:25.378]  Well, this is the group, this is the organization that is the best there is.
[00:11:25.458 --> 00:11:26.479]  And hey, tune in to my show!
[00:11:27.439 --> 00:11:32.386]  You're going to get hardcore analysis and over-the-horizon information on what the Globals are planning next.

[00:11:33.648 --> 00:11:38.554]  It's hardcore because our business is prosperity and freedom and justice and Americana 1776 worldwide!
[00:11:40.976 --> 00:11:41.817]  I've been shadowbanned.
[00:11:42.798 --> 00:11:44.079]  I've been called a liar.
[00:11:44.819 --> 00:11:48.282]  I've been silenced on virtually every platform created by man.
[00:11:48.963 --> 00:11:51.285]  My life has been threatened, repeatedly.
[00:11:51.865 --> 00:11:54.488]  They've tried to destroy me, but I've survived.
[00:11:55.088 --> 00:11:57.310]  That's why I decided to join Mug Club.
