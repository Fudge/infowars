[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:06.774]  El Salvador, like the police in the U.S., had been overrun and defeated, and so the country had collapsed.
[00:00:06.854 --> 00:00:12.778]  They finally had to get ramped up tough, and then go in against them, and they'd beaten them decisively and quickly.
[00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:14.719]  But people say, well, this looks dangerous.
[00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.164]  Well, these people, of many thousands, they report, of police have been killed in the last three years, bringing things to this point in the military.
[00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:22.514]  They're in a war.
[00:00:22.674 --> 00:00:23.274]  They're committed.
[00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:23.995]  They're winning.
[00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:25.055]  Prosperity came back.
[00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:37.699]  And as long as it doesn't get used against political opponents or other groups that are citizens, this is the response we should be seeing to the drug cartels on our border that are doing many of the same things and working with MS-13.
[00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:44.018]   It's time to start arresting them and trying them with speedy trials and to start hanging
[00:00:44.018 --> 00:00:49.577]   their asses and to start hanging the leftists that launder the money and help run this because
[00:00:49.577 --> 00:00:52.738]  that's why Nancy Pelosi is allied with this.
[00:00:52.738 --> 00:00:56.539]   And they know that if they have a criminal gang that can commit, I've been told this
[00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.417]   by high level people in Army Special Operations, you name it, five, six years ago.
[00:01:01.417 --> 00:01:06.338]   And then later it came out in the news that the globalists are using MS-13 to commit assassinations.
[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.302]  The MS-13 15-year-old that does the assassination doesn't even know who gave him the order.
[00:01:10.943 --> 00:01:18.308]  It's total plausible deniability, just like the CIA used Mafia to help kill JFK, was one of the three teams they had there, plausible deniability.
[00:01:18.648 --> 00:01:20.710]  The old Italian Mafia, which is nothing compared to these people.
[00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.252]  And so, this is what they're doing.
[00:01:23.632 --> 00:01:28.696]  So, MS-13 is an arm of the deep state, and Bukele understands that.
[00:01:33.424 --> 00:01:37.834]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:38.155 --> 00:01:40.155]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:50.155]  [Music]
[00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:56.784]   Last year we published a report entitled "Evidence that U.S. Government Targeted Red States with
[00:01:56.784 --> 00:01:58.635]  Deadly Batch of Vaccine."
[00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:01.167]  A story that most outlets ignored.
[00:02:01.607 --> 00:02:08.512]  Private leaked documents from the CDC show a list of expiry dates and only certain lots are included.
[00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:13.316]  The very same lots found to be highly toxic in part of Cooper's database.
[00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:22.864]  This mode of deployment allows governments the ability to direct deadly batches into specific populations, such as red states.
[00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:33.374]  Analysis of the number of dying per 100,000 vaccinated in 50 states shows us that the overwhelming majority of vaccine deaths are happening in red states.
[00:02:34.455 --> 00:02:49.374]  SecondSmartestGuyInTheWorld on Substack also reported on it, and has recently published an update, writing that, now we have a more robust and far more damning view of this carefully distributed depopulation scheme.
[00:02:50.475 --> 00:03:11.160]  Back in Ohio of 2021, the ExposÃ© publishes a report on data found in the USA's VAERS, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which reveals that 100% of COVID-19 vaccine deaths had been caused by just 5% of the batches.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.361]  Batches that can be identified.
[00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:17.102]  And these deadly batches were not distributed evenly.
[00:03:17.842 --> 00:03:31.858]  The top eight states with the highest vaccination death rate, Kentucky, Arkansas, West Virginia, Montana, Alaska, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Tennessee, are all red states.
[00:03:33.337 --> 00:03:42.005]  19 of the top 24 on the list are red states, and California has been the least affected by the deadly lots of COVID vaccine.
[00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:57.519]  The numbers show that Kentucky has a 1,900% worse vaccination death rate than California, suggesting that Kentucky received 20 times the amount of deadly batches than California did.
[00:03:58.303 --> 00:04:13.266]  Florida, number 20 on the list of most vaccine deaths per vaccination, received three times the amount of deadly batches than California, with its vaccination death rate at 200% higher than California's.
[00:04:14.686 --> 00:04:34.581]   The author points out that these deadly batches would be better classified as rapid kill lots and slow kill lots, as we are now seeing more evidence that they kill over time, And the evidence shows that red states were targeted with the rapid kill shots.
[00:04:35.502 --> 00:04:49.251]  This would go along with the United Nations Agenda 2030 plan, which seeks to move the entire population into crowded cities and federalize all of flyover country in the name of climate change.
[00:04:50.526 --> 00:04:55.791]  They have less than seven years to accomplish this, and they are deadly serious about it.
[00:04:56.712 --> 00:05:06.802]  The US government is in lockstep with the United Nations, and they will resort to murder and democide to accomplish their goals of total control.
[00:05:07.643 --> 00:05:13.026]  Many are suggesting that this is what is happening in East Palestine, Ohio, right now.
[00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:22.251]  The people of America are under attack by their own government, who is never going to quit until they accomplish their goals, or unless they are stopped.
[00:05:22.992 --> 00:05:25.792]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:38.792]  [Music]
[00:05:38.792 --> 00:05:43.792]  Well, it's already the last day of the second month of...
[00:05:44.055 --> 00:05:46.998]  Wow, we're really racing into the future, aren't we?
[00:05:47.018 --> 00:05:52.583]  Thank you for joining us on this live Tuesday, February 28th, 2023 transmission.
[00:05:52.603 --> 00:05:58.248]  We've got masses of absolute critical news, the good, the bad, the ugly to be covering with you here today.
[00:05:58.968 --> 00:06:02.632]  And then Mike Adams is coming in to co-host in the second, third hour.
[00:06:03.337 --> 00:06:05.858]  With very special guests as well.
[00:06:06.378 --> 00:06:14.562]  Some very hard-hitting, massive breaking news in the second and third hour as well, and on into the fourth today here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:14.962 --> 00:06:16.143]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:06:17.563 --> 00:06:22.726]  All right, I talked a lot Sunday and Monday about the chain reaction of Global Awakening that's happening.
[00:06:23.626 --> 00:06:28.448]  Now the enemy's going to strike back at that by cutting off resources and crashing economies.
[00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:46.164]   And we've seen some major developments Give us a window into how the New World Order plans to bring down civilization using organized crime gangs that they basically steer, protect, and at the top, control.
[00:06:46.845 --> 00:06:59.733]  And of course, I'm talking about MS-13 that is originally based out of El Salvador, but that started in the U.S.
[00:06:59.873 --> 00:07:00.714]  prison system.
[00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:01.274]  And the U.S.
[00:07:01.314 --> 00:07:15.150]   prison system And for over a hundred years, how they've controlled the prison system is by segregating people into different groups and then playing those groups off against each other with a divide and conquer strategy.
[00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:21.835]  So Naib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, only got in about a year ago.
[00:07:22.655 --> 00:07:25.317]  Crime has dropped about 97 percent.
[00:07:25.917 --> 00:07:27.118]  Violent crime about 99 percent.
[00:07:29.163 --> 00:07:40.908]  Since he got in because most of the crime is committed by the hundred thousand strong or so MS-13 that are one of the most murderous vicious death cults in the world.
[00:07:40.948 --> 00:07:43.989]  They do satanic rituals when they torture people to death.
[00:07:44.649 --> 00:07:45.210]  You name it.
[00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:58.893]   They literally worship Satan and they have been a scourge not just in the US and El Salvador, but in Mexico and in Mexico The Army just basically goes in and slaughters them all.
[00:07:59.753 --> 00:08:04.255]  And then they'll send in their people into places like Cancun and other areas just to randomly shoot people.
[00:08:04.775 --> 00:08:06.696]  That's the MS-13.
[00:08:07.336 --> 00:08:11.998]  Now, if you'll remember Nancy Pelosi, what, three or four years ago?
[00:08:12.018 --> 00:08:13.258]  In fact, I forgot to tell the crew.
[00:08:13.398 --> 00:08:15.899]  Find that clip for when Harrison Smith comes on in 30 minutes to talk about this.
[00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:20.721]  I'm just giving you a prelude right now, where she says, we shouldn't be mean to MS-13.
[00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:22.602]  We're all God's children.
[00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:38.761]  That's because it's well known that MS-13 and other Latin gangs, but they're the most vicious, launder money to the Democratic Party, help run the smuggling, and take a big cut to their lawyers and others of the narcotics, money for methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, the list goes on and on.
[00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:52.391]  So MS-13 takes young street children about age 10, basically trains them, puts them through hell, makes them by age 13 start committing major crimes, by about 14 to 15 committing murders, to become fully made members of the gang.
[00:08:53.152 --> 00:08:56.453]  So when you have those particular tattoos, that is their uniform.
[00:08:57.913 --> 00:08:59.173]  It's like a Nazi uniform.
[00:08:59.213 --> 00:09:00.413]  It's like a communist uniform.
[00:09:01.234 --> 00:09:03.254]  You don't get those unless you're in the gang.
[00:09:03.274 --> 00:09:05.874]  And if you have those and don't have them, the gang kills you.
[00:09:06.835 --> 00:09:07.135]  Okay?
[00:09:08.375 --> 00:09:24.067]   So when Naib Bukele started arresting upwards of 40,000 of these people for being known members of a terrorist organization, Basically take over and murder and slaughter and do whatever they want.
[00:09:24.527 --> 00:09:25.968]  Arguably the worst gang on the planet.
[00:09:25.988 --> 00:09:31.412]  It's not run by the Globals completely, but it's definitely partially protected by them.
[00:09:32.853 --> 00:09:37.276]  It's going to take a military action to deal with that, or you let that military group that is MS-13 win.
[00:09:38.117 --> 00:09:38.938]  And that's all this is.
[00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:41.259]  So I don't like a police state.
[00:09:41.299 --> 00:09:47.484]  You can run some of the B-roll of the videos that the President's put out of all the troops and formations out there, and he talks about honor and will and courage.
[00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:49.285]  We'll be playing some of those clips coming up.
[00:09:50.366 --> 00:09:55.369]  I know that the President is a listener, and I know he's a supporter of Infowars.
[00:09:55.409 --> 00:09:59.311]  I know he's retweeted often on Infowars reports and videos.
[00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:03.634]  We did have an invite by Bolsonaro to go down to Brazil and interview him a few years ago.
[00:10:03.654 --> 00:10:04.514]  We just couldn't do it.
[00:10:05.755 --> 00:10:07.376]  We really wanted to go, but we were just tied down here.
[00:10:07.396 --> 00:10:13.539]  Never got to that, but it looks like we're probably going to be able to go out and interview this guy, and it looks like we probably will do it.
[00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:19.335]  I understand that people are concerned about this, and I'm not even defending it.
[00:10:19.755 --> 00:10:22.116]  But when you have cancer, what are you going to do about it?
[00:10:22.876 --> 00:10:25.737]  And so they protected these gangs here in the U.S.
[00:10:25.957 --> 00:10:31.238]  The Soros DAs let them out of prison all across the United States when they commit seriously violent crimes.
[00:10:31.558 --> 00:10:34.419]  They're working with the globalist Soros Democratic Party.
[00:10:35.327 --> 00:10:35.987]  Crime axis.
[00:10:36.047 --> 00:10:47.751]  So now the CIA control Washington Post, New York Times are basically calling for Naib Bukele to be removed from office, even though he was elected with about 60% of the vote.
[00:10:47.831 --> 00:10:52.312]  He has the most popular polling numbers ever seen in Latin America, not just in El Salvador.
[00:10:52.633 --> 00:10:58.214]  He has a 95% positive rating in one year in El Salvador.
[00:10:58.554 --> 00:11:02.556]  He has over a 80% approval rating in Latin America.
[00:11:02.736 --> 00:11:06.983]   So he's Above and beyond even the popularity of Bolsonaro.
[00:11:08.103 --> 00:11:13.325]  And of course, Bolsonaro had his hands tied because he didn't control the Congress.
[00:11:13.345 --> 00:11:15.165]  He didn't control the Supreme Court that are communist.
[00:11:15.585 --> 00:11:17.026]  So, as you saw, they stole the election.
[00:11:17.046 --> 00:11:18.186]  The State Department ran that and removed him.
[00:11:19.046 --> 00:11:27.169]  So, what is Bukele supposed to do when there were tens of thousands of murders a month?
[00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.890]  By MS-13.
[00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.551]  Shaking down, kidnappings, businesses, everything under their control.
[00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:34.152]  Police officers being shot every day.
[00:11:34.832 --> 00:11:37.073]  What are you supposed to do when they're wearing a military uniform?
[00:11:37.793 --> 00:11:43.074]  That's what those tattoos are, of how many murders they've committed, what team they work with, what they did.
[00:11:43.475 --> 00:11:45.895]  One tattoo is when they're 10, they rob somebody.
[00:11:46.615 --> 00:11:49.756]  When they're 11, they start doing more robberies.
[00:11:49.776 --> 00:11:51.817]  When they're 12, 13, they start murdering people.
[00:11:52.794 --> 00:11:56.875]  And so, some of these guys have committed hundreds of murders apiece, and those are the kingpins.
[00:11:56.895 --> 00:12:03.278]  And those are the 90 MS-13 leaders that the military and police bashed their brains out in the prison.
[00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:10.040]  So, before they took them out of all the smaller prisons, this one big giant one they built for 40,000 of them, they went in and beat the leaders to death.
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.561]  So, they're not going to be running their prison inside there the way the U.S.
[00:12:13.601 --> 00:12:15.082]  lets gang leaders run things.
[00:12:15.102 --> 00:12:23.138]   They're isolated, and they're not going to be running their gangs from inside, and they're basically in a Supermax Prison.
[00:12:23.979 --> 00:12:25.639]  And so it's very, very harsh.
[00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:27.640]  It's very, very serious.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:35.622]  And I'm not saying that I don't think it couldn't turn into its own tyranny once this police state deals with what they have.
[00:12:35.702 --> 00:12:53.542]   But once you have lawlessness and defund the police and gangs taking over, once the police get pushed back like you see all over the U.S., Things collapse into lawlessness, and then the deep state can bring in its own leftist tyranny that controls the police, that will then arrest political dissidents and go after conservatives.
[00:12:53.822 --> 00:12:57.603]  Like the New York Times wants people for their speech arrested, but they want MS-13 let out of jail.
[00:12:57.623 --> 00:12:58.143]  See how it works?
[00:12:58.584 --> 00:13:09.428]  So the leftists like this model of lawlessness and collapse to a certain extent if it brings in a Hugo Chavez for them, or if it brings in an Adolf Hitler for them.
[00:13:09.868 --> 00:13:15.015]   Hitler used major street wars and crime exploding And the promised peace come to power.
[00:13:15.055 --> 00:13:16.375]  So it's a double-edged sword.
[00:13:16.435 --> 00:13:19.277]  Will Bukele use this to become a dictator?
[00:13:19.317 --> 00:13:22.798]  Will he use this to go after his opposition that isn't MS-13?
[00:13:23.619 --> 00:13:28.541]  Normally, historically, especially in Latin America, but most places as well, it ends up happening.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.841]   We're run by the security apparatus here in the United States at the top.
[00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:36.201]   It's waging war against the local police by putting in their own Soros prosecutors,
[00:13:36.201 --> 00:13:39.560]   people who are not prosecuted, and then attacking police when they make minor
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.240]   mistakes or even when they don't make mistakes to bully and control them and
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.240]  come in and socialize them under the new communist way.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.880]   And then the police will be more brutal than ever once the communists are in
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.081]  control.
[00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:53.680]  Bukele is a big Bitcoiner.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.721]  He's a big anti-New World Order.
[00:13:55.721 --> 00:13:56.760]  He's a fan of Infowars.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:02.820]   So that makes the scales tip towards him to understanding, you want to be ruled by MS-13 or you want to let us take
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.600]  these guys out?
[00:14:04.018 --> 00:14:15.245]  And again, anybody that's a citizen under our law or the other laws around the world modeled after ours has due process, has rights, should be tried, and their accomplices should be jailed with them.
[00:14:15.966 --> 00:14:29.950]   But when you have an outside military force trained in the U.S., MS-13, Let's come back into El Salvador that has military markings all over them and that basically just like generals and admirals and colonels have fruit salad on them telling you their campaigns and what they did.
[00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:34.493]  MS-13 is a military operation and those are all of their campaigns.
[00:14:35.237 --> 00:14:35.937]  And what they've done.
[00:14:36.017 --> 00:14:44.142]  So they're in military uniforms, robbing, killing, stealing, kidnapping, creating horrible drugs, just absolutely out of control behavior.
[00:14:44.622 --> 00:14:50.165]  They make all the other gangs, all the other gangsters, all the other groups look like sweetie pies that maintain order compared to them.
[00:14:50.885 --> 00:14:52.946]  And so it remains to be seen.
[00:14:52.966 --> 00:14:54.027]  We're going to look at this closely.
[00:14:54.047 --> 00:14:58.389]  But also the biggest news first, when we come back, we'll revisit MS-13 in about 15 minutes.
[00:14:58.609 --> 00:14:59.990]  But first, the big news.
[00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.491]  The government now admits COVID-19 was made in a lab.
[00:15:02.531 --> 00:15:03.412]  We told you three years ago.
[00:15:03.612 --> 00:15:03.992]  Stay with us.
[00:15:05.618 --> 00:15:07.960]  And we are live on this Tuesday broadcast.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.501]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:15:09.521 --> 00:15:16.626]  Harrison Smith will be in the Austin, Texas studios, joining me coming up on this very important issue of El Salvador and the globalist response to it.
[00:15:17.066 --> 00:15:22.911]  But I want to get into something very important and even bigger than what's happening with MS-13 and the example it shows us.
[00:15:23.531 --> 00:15:24.092]  And that's this.
[00:15:25.553 --> 00:15:42.213]   Three years ago, plus in January, late January, February, March and April of 2020, I went to the top experts in the world on bioweapons and the history of them and laboratories and what's happening.
[00:15:42.753 --> 00:15:48.896]  And I checked with what experts in the US, Europe, India, Australia, Russia were saying.
[00:15:49.736 --> 00:15:59.800]  And the first was a major Indian university is the only Indian university that bought the CRISPR software.
[00:16:00.644 --> 00:16:05.226]  And has other very high-tech computer systems that can scan viruses.
[00:16:06.047 --> 00:16:09.768]  And they looked at COVID-19 and they said, it's got the p-shuttle gene, a bunch of other things.
[00:16:09.848 --> 00:16:16.712]  And basically, it's like in Blade Runner, where he takes the scale to the, you know, cloning market.
[00:16:17.212 --> 00:16:19.533]  And asks the lady under an electron microscope, what is this?
[00:16:19.573 --> 00:16:19.933]  A fish?
[00:16:19.953 --> 00:16:20.333]  A snake?
[00:16:20.394 --> 00:16:20.794]  What is it?
[00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:21.834]  And who made it?
[00:16:21.854 --> 00:16:22.995]  And she says, yeah, it's a snake.
[00:16:23.635 --> 00:16:24.956]  And it was made by this company.
[00:16:25.556 --> 00:16:27.877]  Superior craftsmanship, blah, blah, blah.
[00:16:27.917 --> 00:16:29.218]  That's a science fiction movie from the 80s.
[00:16:29.258 --> 00:16:29.718]  This is real.
[00:16:30.666 --> 00:16:34.128]  And in the movie, there's a serial number on the cells.
[00:16:35.209 --> 00:16:41.593]  In the real world, there are injection sites where they smash the viruses together.
[00:16:42.494 --> 00:16:46.276]  And you think, man, they've got scalpels and things they can put a virus together.
[00:16:46.336 --> 00:16:48.398]  No, they have these big gene guns.
[00:16:49.398 --> 00:16:50.339]  There's different ways they do it.
[00:16:50.359 --> 00:16:55.242]  They just fire millions and millions of cells of the types they want together.
[00:16:55.783 --> 00:16:59.465]  And then under electron microscopes, they divide out the viruses that are what they want.
[00:17:00.188 --> 00:17:02.930]  Then they put those into pigs or other animals and have them get sick.
[00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.272]  Then they drain the blood out of that and then put it into other animals and other things.
[00:17:06.292 --> 00:17:14.356]  There's a lot of different ways to do it, but we know what Bill Gates and all these different globals were doing at Chapel Hill, North Carolina and the Wuhan lab.
[00:17:14.396 --> 00:17:19.359]  And there were big scandals in 2015 that Obama was funding the gain of function of a SARS COVID virus.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:25.124]   And so we specifically, exactly, Because of Dr. Francis Boyle, who wrote the U.S.
[00:17:25.144 --> 00:17:35.490]  chemical biological weapons laws, the law, the guy that was the head UN prosecutor after that for war crimes, he came on and said, this is what happened.
[00:17:36.451 --> 00:17:40.754]  He was 100% dead on, should get 15 Pulitzer Prizes.
[00:17:41.635 --> 00:17:42.535]  I mean, it's just insane.
[00:17:42.915 --> 00:17:44.296]  Nothing is, I've never seen anything so dead on.
[00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:47.799]  He was saying in early, no, late January 2020.
[00:17:48.712 --> 00:17:52.155]  And then we went and looked at what the Indians said, and boy, they got attacked.
[00:17:52.355 --> 00:18:04.203]  And the Indians said, well, we're having all our funding threatened, so we're not going to say we're wrong, but we're going to withdraw our paper with the electron microscope scans, and we're going to say we've withdrawn it under pressure.
[00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:14.851]  Then a bunch of other governments, including in France, and the discovery of HIV, he went public, taught virologists the world and said, it is five viruses, it's a chimera.
[00:18:15.672 --> 00:18:16.993]  And it was made in a frickin' lab.
[00:18:17.613 --> 00:18:23.575]  In a trillion years, a virus wouldn't evolve to be five different viruses from different families, including an HIV spike protein.
[00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:25.536]  Okay, that's the delivery system.
[00:18:25.816 --> 00:18:26.837]  It's highly toxic as well.
[00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:30.278]  So, we knew that early on.
[00:18:30.698 --> 00:18:36.160]  And in vaccine trials for regular vaccines for COVID, people would say they were HIV positive.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.901]  That happened in Australia, the U.S., everywhere.
[00:18:37.921 --> 00:18:39.562]  They said, oh, don't worry, you don't really have HIV.
[00:18:39.902 --> 00:18:43.003]  The vaccine just gives us a false positive.
[00:18:43.797 --> 00:18:46.399]  Because it sees the spike protein in the HIV test.
[00:18:46.419 --> 00:18:47.219]  That's what it tests for.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.361]  So we knew they made this.
[00:18:50.161 --> 00:19:02.050]  And now, three years later, three years and a month later, so that's 25 months later, the Pentagon comes out, the Justice Department comes out, they say, okay, it was made in the lab, it's man-made.
[00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:03.891]  Well, we knew it was man-made.
[00:19:04.594 --> 00:19:05.756]  The issue is who made it.
[00:19:05.796 --> 00:19:07.158]  And I'd love to blame the CHICOMs.
[00:19:07.198 --> 00:19:07.719]  They're terrible.
[00:19:07.739 --> 00:19:08.561]  They're horrible.
[00:19:08.841 --> 00:19:13.649]  They're involved doing the whole police state rollout and the lockdowns and working with the whole CHICOM element in our government.
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.902]  But there's a rip between the shy comms and their buddies in the U.S.
[00:19:16.942 --> 00:19:20.244]  government now, so they're letting this come out and trying to blame the Chinese.
[00:19:20.624 --> 00:19:32.751]  Well, the Chinese were involved, but the main virus was made in 2014, did a big scandal in 2015, major news articles, and was then shipped to China where they could illegally keep working on gain-of-function.
[00:19:33.092 --> 00:19:43.438]   So in the last 48 hours, Fauci and the rest of them have gone from saying there was no gain-of-function, I have the clips right here, To Kirby at the Pentagon and others saying, well, we should be proud we're doing gain-of-function.
[00:19:43.858 --> 00:19:46.420]  It's a good thing to keep you safe, make weaponized viruses.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:52.064]  So if somebody else just makes this magic virus that would never have existed, they'd have no idea how to make it, that the U.S.
[00:19:52.084 --> 00:19:54.645]  government made, well, we'll be able to counter it.
[00:19:54.665 --> 00:19:55.706]  We'll be able to respond to it.
[00:19:56.286 --> 00:20:01.930]  So they think you're so stupid that, A, they told you it wasn't a man-made when they knew it was because they made it.
[00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.811]  They had the receipts.
[00:20:03.291 --> 00:20:07.374]  We have all the emails going back and forth how they made it, had the so-called vaccines ready before it even got rolled out.
[00:20:08.157 --> 00:20:12.778]  For their whole plan to do this, the World ID, the Castle Society, the vaccine passports, everything.
[00:20:14.078 --> 00:20:16.078]  And now they're saying, oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:20:16.118 --> 00:20:17.339]  Gain of function's good.
[00:20:17.499 --> 00:20:18.859]  We always told you we were doing that.
[00:20:19.339 --> 00:20:20.099]  And we have the clips.
[00:20:20.139 --> 00:20:21.039]  Do I even need to play the clips?
[00:20:21.079 --> 00:20:21.739]  It's all over the news.
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.280]  You want to hear Kirby?
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.960]  Do you want to hear Fauci?
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.040]  Do you want to hear Biden?
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.140]  Do you want to hear this?
[00:20:27.921 --> 00:20:29.761]  Where three years later, they're like, oh, yeah.
[00:20:29.981 --> 00:20:31.141]  And remember the cherry on top.
[00:20:33.042 --> 00:20:41.840]   Thousands of doctors and scientists and virologists Including the discoverer of HIV got censored and banned off of Twitter and Facebook and places.
[00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:49.506]  And Dr. Malone, the discoverer and developer of mRNA technology, he got banned and so did Dr. Michael Yedon and everybody else.
[00:20:50.387 --> 00:20:56.192]  And still Dr. Yedon is still banned, former chief scientist at Pfizer, who said all the same stuff two and a half years ago.
[00:20:56.232 --> 00:20:59.014]  He was like five months after Boyle.
[00:21:01.232 --> 00:21:07.394]  So, at InfoWars, we created the roadmap of reality, total vindication, with real hardcore research.
[00:21:07.754 --> 00:21:12.656]  It's not about the credit, it's about why the enemy hates us, why InfoWars is critical, and must stay on the air.
[00:21:12.816 --> 00:21:18.198]  We were 100% on target.
[00:21:18.598 --> 00:21:30.562]  Where it came from, how they did it, and then what the shot would do, on average, a Pfizer shot, on average, is about six, seven times worse than catching one of the earlier variants of COVID, because it gets a little less bad as it mutates.
[00:21:31.815 --> 00:21:32.696]  That's just a guesstimation.
[00:21:33.758 --> 00:21:42.410]  But if you look at the Moderna shot, it's got to be like 15, 20 times worse because it's four Pfizer shots.
[00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.991]  It's the same thing.
[00:21:44.093 --> 00:22:02.317]  It was developed by criminal elements, run by the globalists, the military-industrial complex, yet the Pentagon, that's all come out, fenced through North Carolina, Chapel Hill, fenced into China, so there'd be plausible deniability when Fauci and Bill Gates and the New World Order release their virus to roll out the Great Reset, the Castle Society, and to take over our bodies.
[00:22:03.248 --> 00:22:07.609]  That's what they've done, and that's why exposing them and bringing them to justice isn't about vindictiveness.
[00:22:07.649 --> 00:22:09.149]  It's not even about justice for the victims.
[00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:10.110]  That's the big part of it.
[00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:23.073]  But we've got to stop them from doing it again, because now they're getting weaponized Marburg and weaponized mousepox and weaponized bird flu ready and are pre-programming the same way they did before COVID to launch the next phase of Disease X.
[00:22:24.031 --> 00:22:33.498]  Disease Y. Disease Z. So they're bringing in, with the UN and the World Treaty, public being prepared to take over our medical systems of every major nation and to take over our bodies.
[00:22:33.738 --> 00:22:36.380]  And Biden says he doesn't care if Congress doesn't ratify the UN Treaty.
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.163]  He has said that they're going to follow the United Nations Treaty.
[00:22:40.623 --> 00:22:42.164]  And who helped write the UN Treaty?
[00:22:42.464 --> 00:22:48.949]  The CIA, the Carnegie Endowment, and Biden's new chief of staff that was the head of the COVID response.
[00:22:50.911 --> 00:22:51.471]  Now you get it.
[00:22:51.792 --> 00:22:55.154]  Their main attack is going to be using viruses very soon.
[00:22:55.394 --> 00:23:08.142]  And if folks want to lay there and let them kill you, or let them take over your body and give you poison shots and maim you or kill you, and if people want to be locked down again, and if you want to be in a destroyed civilization, then by all means, folks, you go ahead and you attack InfoWars and you don't support us.
[00:23:08.422 --> 00:23:24.474]   And I'm telling you, all the corporate press people, all the lawyers, all the people that serve the system, that think you're safe joining the New World Order, because you're such losers and such followers, that you think By groveling under the dark wings of Satan, you're going to be protected.
[00:23:24.514 --> 00:23:24.894]  You're not.
[00:23:25.134 --> 00:23:26.995]  You're destroying yourself, fools.
[00:23:27.235 --> 00:23:28.516]  You're destroying us with you.
[00:23:28.736 --> 00:23:38.923]  We all need to go public and complete the chain reaction and say no more gain of function, no more bioweapons, and bring those that did this to justice before they do it again and kill all of us.
[00:23:38.903 --> 00:23:39.903]  We'll be back.
[00:23:39.903 --> 00:24:06.903]  [Music]
[00:24:06.903 --> 00:24:16.903]   For TV viewers, you are witnessing scenes in El Salvador over the highest crime rate in Latin America.
[00:24:16.903 --> 00:24:23.913]   Hundreds of thousands of murders committed by MS-13, a paramilitary group whose tattoos are the military uniform
[00:24:23.913 --> 00:24:30.903]   of how many murders and crimes and extortions and kidnappings they have committed.
[00:24:31.565 --> 00:24:37.630]  And so they don't have the normal rights, citizens in due process, when you're an outside trained in the U.S.
[00:24:38.071 --> 00:24:43.318]   by globalist crime syndicates operatives, but it's a very dangerous slippery slope where
[00:24:43.318 --> 00:24:45.278]   then it could be used against the general public.
[00:24:45.278 --> 00:24:46.519]  That's what the Patriot Act was.
[00:24:46.519 --> 00:24:49.639]   They said, "Oh, this is just for radical Muslims who aren't citizens."
[00:24:49.639 --> 00:24:54.439]   But it was written for citizens and now today we're told the main terror threat is the American
[00:24:54.439 --> 00:24:55.439]  people.
[00:24:55.439 --> 00:25:00.039]   So we like to see crime dropping by 95% or more in El Salvador in one year since Naib
[00:25:00.039 --> 00:25:04.438]  Boukhele got elected.
[00:25:05.379 --> 00:25:06.620]  He's an InfoWars listener.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.161]  He's a Tucker Carlson fan.
[00:25:08.561 --> 00:25:09.522]  He tweets out our show.
[00:25:09.542 --> 00:25:10.662]  He tweets out Harrison Smith.
[00:25:11.883 --> 00:25:13.164]  And so it looks good.
[00:25:13.284 --> 00:25:20.389]  And what are you supposed to do when MS-13 is running around killing thousands of people a month on average and totally lawless and as a paramilitary group?
[00:25:21.389 --> 00:25:22.170]  Well, that's what you do.
[00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.992]  That's what the military is for when an army is attacking somebody.
[00:25:26.453 --> 00:25:30.776]  But historically, once the army defeats that problem, they will then become that problem.
[00:25:31.196 --> 00:25:32.737]  Now, is it a lesser of two evils?
[00:25:35.464 --> 00:25:38.965]  The new leader is good.
[00:25:40.145 --> 00:25:46.166]  The military can assassinate him a year from now, five years from now, and then they're in control.
[00:25:47.006 --> 00:25:49.046]  And that's the problem with centralization.
[00:25:49.126 --> 00:25:52.007]  Even if it does good for a while, it's like the Ring of Mordor.
[00:25:52.047 --> 00:25:53.307]  It ends up causing a big problem.
[00:25:53.647 --> 00:25:54.627]  I want to go to Harrison Smith.
[00:25:54.647 --> 00:25:56.148]  He's been doing a great job covering this.
[00:25:56.188 --> 00:25:58.448]  He's really been peeling the onion on it.
[00:25:58.468 --> 00:26:02.769]  I want to get his take on this, but let's play a clip here.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:09.864]  From Harrison's show a few days ago that's gone viral that the president of El Salvador retweeted on his official Twitter.
[00:26:10.504 --> 00:26:12.165]  That's clip 10, I believe.
[00:26:12.325 --> 00:26:13.366]  Here is Harrison Smith.
[00:26:14.807 --> 00:26:17.509]  In fact, we have this homicide chart.
[00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:19.070]  El Salvador homicide rate from 2010 to 2022.
[00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.332]  You can see that the murders reached a zenith in 2015 with nearly 7,000.
[00:26:22.172 --> 00:26:32.572]   The murders reached a zenith in 2015 with nearly 7,000, 6,656 murders in a single year
[00:26:32.572 --> 00:26:34.812]  for a daily homicide rate of 18.
[00:26:34.822 --> 00:26:36.964]  As of 2022, the total homicides have gone from nearly 7,000 to under 600.
[00:26:36.803 --> 00:26:40.563]  three homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.
[00:26:40.563 --> 00:26:47.363]   As of 2022, the total homicides have gone from nearly 7,000 to under 600.
[00:26:47.363 --> 00:26:52.242]  The daily homicide rate has gone from 18.2 to 1.8.
[00:26:52.242 --> 00:26:57.923]   And the homicides per 100,000 inhabitants has gone from 103 to 10.3,
[00:26:57.923 --> 00:27:01.482]  literally one-tenth of the former amount.
[00:27:01.523 --> 00:27:07.544]  And you can see the precipitous drop beginning in 2019, continuing through 2020, 2021, and into 2022, where it has gone down to, yeah, 600 total homicides or less this entire year.
[00:27:07.364 --> 00:27:17.364]   and into 2022 where it has gone down to 600 total homicides or less this entire year.
[00:27:17.364 --> 00:27:22.004]  6,600 to under 600.
[00:27:22.004 --> 00:27:22.883]  All thanks to this guy.
[00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:27.402]  Of course, what do you think the powers that be think about this guy?
[00:27:27.882 --> 00:27:30.323]  How do you think this guy's portrayed in the mainstream media?
[00:27:30.343 --> 00:27:34.544]  Well, all you have to do is search his name, Nayib Bukele, and you can see.
[00:27:34.684 --> 00:27:40.566]  And it's like, even if you don't know anything about this guy, search his name, read the headlines, come up to yourself whether he's a good guy or not.
[00:27:40.586 --> 00:27:41.366]  Because here's the headlines.
[00:27:42.086 --> 00:27:45.428]  El Salvador's war on itself, the siege of Soyopango.
[00:27:45.448 --> 00:27:46.928]  And we'll talk about what that is exactly.
[00:27:47.488 --> 00:27:49.429]  Bitfinex goes full fascist.
[00:27:50.109 --> 00:27:53.813]  Report on Salvadorian gang crackdown details killings, other abuses.
[00:27:54.394 --> 00:27:56.997]  Thousands of troops surround city in gang crackdown.
[00:27:58.038 --> 00:28:01.041]  State Department Salvadorians tried to directly influence US election.
[00:28:01.402 --> 00:28:05.586]  Trolls, propaganda and fear stoke Bukele's media machine in El Salvador.
[00:28:06.687 --> 00:28:06.887]  Right?
[00:28:07.107 --> 00:28:07.848]  They hate this guy.
[00:28:07.888 --> 00:28:08.988]  They despise this guy.
[00:28:09.489 --> 00:28:11.890]  Because he's showing that there is another way.
[00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.692]  He's showing that you can actually fix problems.
[00:28:15.232 --> 00:28:18.334]  Yeah, he's going to war with the criminal elements in his country.
[00:28:18.414 --> 00:28:25.338]  Of course, this is infuriating to the otherwise totally authoritarian mainstream media in this country.
[00:28:26.815 --> 00:28:30.979]  Rise of Nayah Bukele, El Salvador's authoritarian president from the New Yorker.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:37.927]  The budding strongman has ridden Bitcoin shemes in a repressive crackdown on gangs to become Latin America's most popular leader.
[00:28:39.648 --> 00:28:43.272]  Most popular leader in South America because he's cracking down on the gang.
[00:28:43.512 --> 00:28:46.455]  They're literally like, how dare this guy crack down on gangs?
[00:28:46.896 --> 00:28:48.037]  He's repressing gangs.
[00:28:48.097 --> 00:28:48.637]  How dare he?
[00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:57.414]  He's repressing the murderous cartels that have made life in El Salvador unbearable in the past.
[00:28:57.514 --> 00:28:58.555]  How dare he do that?
[00:28:58.815 --> 00:29:03.518]  So we're going to go to a speech now that he gave to his troops right before they embarked on this mission.
[00:29:05.179 --> 00:29:08.961]  He says, for eight months we have been fighting the war against these gangs.
[00:29:10.242 --> 00:29:12.123]  And thank God we're winning.
[00:29:13.869 --> 00:29:18.075]  This is a very surprising victory that is nearly within our grasp.
[00:29:18.155 --> 00:29:23.442]  Let it be clear that the glory is for God, and it's in God's glory.
[00:29:23.983 --> 00:29:25.325]  And it is God's glory.
[00:29:25.345 --> 00:29:29.411]  We humans are lucky to be instruments of God.
[00:29:30.732 --> 00:29:38.039]  To bring peace, liberty and happiness to the Salvadorian people.
[00:29:38.499 --> 00:29:41.982]  We are the instrument to heal this land.
[00:29:42.062 --> 00:29:45.205]  Each of you is an instrument of God to do this.
[00:29:45.405 --> 00:29:51.251]  Peace is not reached through agreements signed between corrupt sharing power amongst killers.
[00:29:52.572 --> 00:29:53.853]  Peace is built with hard work.
[00:29:55.594 --> 00:30:01.157]  With sweat, with effort, and with the bravery that you and your brothers in the police have.
[00:30:01.837 --> 00:30:06.100]  You must have something to be able to know that you are part of something greater than yourself.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:11.222]  And that it's worth risking your life for that purpose that is more important than yourself alone.
[00:30:12.403 --> 00:30:13.023]  It's values.
[00:30:14.944 --> 00:30:19.347]  Values such as bravery, such as courage, such as strength, discipline.
[00:30:21.159 --> 00:30:27.248]  Patriotism, honor, loyalty, and love for your fellow man.
[00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:32.897]  These are fundamental values for human society, but these values are increasingly scarce in the world.
[00:30:33.773 --> 00:30:48.481]  If you watch the international news, you'll see how the most important values for human beings, such as honor, loyal, bravery, courage, and love for your fellow man, are precisely the values that we are losing with each passing day.
[00:30:49.802 --> 00:30:57.245]  And that's why you can see how societies that seem to have won, now are degrading, as they are losing the values that made them great.
[00:30:57.205 --> 00:31:04.205]   Those values were probably not strong in this land and were strong in other lands.
[00:31:04.205 --> 00:31:06.205]  And that's why those lands grew and became great.
[00:31:06.991 --> 00:31:10.172]  They're losing those values now.
[00:31:10.232 --> 00:31:17.275]  On the other hand, in El Salvador, those values that were precisely degraded in our country are now the most important ones.
[00:31:17.615 --> 00:31:19.135]  Just take a look at yourselves.
[00:31:19.215 --> 00:31:21.876]  Young men and women who embody all these values.
[00:31:22.557 --> 00:31:25.858]  How could a nation not rise up with values such as these?
[00:31:25.898 --> 00:31:32.080]  How could a nation not rise up when it puts God first and then puts in the hard work and effort with these kinds of values?
[00:31:34.708 --> 00:31:36.169]  All right, we're going to go to Harrison.
[00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:37.930]  Really good speech.
[00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:42.213]  We're going to go to Harrison here in just a moment, respond to this, but I want to be clear.
[00:31:43.194 --> 00:31:49.659]  Um, who Kelly, I guess, got in a three years ago, but he didn't get control of the Congress and things behind him until about a year ago.
[00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:54.282]  And in less than a year, crime rates gone down, depending on the crime, 90 to 95%.
[00:31:55.002 --> 00:32:01.427]  Uh, and it's one of the safest countries now, not just in Latin America, but in this whole hemisphere.
[00:32:02.333 --> 00:32:08.698]  And he did go on Tucker Carlson and say, America's the greatest country ever because of God and free market and hard work and good people.
[00:32:09.118 --> 00:32:13.581]  Now look at you, you're being destroyed from within by the globalists, by the New World Order, and you've got to get control.
[00:32:13.601 --> 00:32:17.784]  You've got to stop the crime wave or you're going to fall like Latin American countries.
[00:32:17.824 --> 00:32:18.765]  That's why the globalists do this.
[00:32:19.365 --> 00:32:21.327]  So I believe he's coming from a good place.
[00:32:21.907 --> 00:32:26.150]  And now he's got a 95% approval rating, but there's still some slippery slopes here.
[00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:32.035]  And what if the globalists assassinate him and then put in a new guy that controls this paramilitary force?
[00:32:32.055 --> 00:32:33.216]  Harrison, what's your take on this?
[00:32:33.976 --> 00:32:46.429]  Well, I definitely think that it's a possibility, but you can tell from that speech that he seems to have a very good grounding and it's the values that he's promoting that give people the loyalty to him.
[00:32:46.729 --> 00:32:53.396]  It seems like if somebody came in with a different set of values, maybe they wouldn't have the same response from the troops that they're leading.
[00:32:53.636 --> 00:32:56.620]   It really seems like The people of El Salvador are responding to this.
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:04.670]  Every call we've gotten on American Journal, all of the comments I've seen on Twitter, since that video has gotten 1.5 million views at this point, they've all been totally positive.
[00:33:05.311 --> 00:33:08.335]  So, so far so good, but I totally get your point for sure.
[00:33:09.955 --> 00:33:10.656]  All right, stay there.
[00:33:10.696 --> 00:33:14.779]  I want to get into this more and why the globalists are so scared of Bukele.
[00:33:14.919 --> 00:33:17.101]  On the other side, InfoWars.com.
[00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:19.723]  Tomorrow's news today, spread the word about the live show, folks.
[00:33:19.763 --> 00:33:21.404]  Remember, you're the real power of the broadcast.
[00:33:21.725 --> 00:33:23.626]  Welcome back to this Live Tuesday broadcast.
[00:33:23.726 --> 00:33:33.935]  Mike Adams, out of his new amazing studios, is going to be hosting right outside Austin, dialed into our system with several big guests joining him in the second and third hour.
[00:33:34.615 --> 00:33:36.778]  Again, I'm getting back to Austin on Friday.
[00:33:36.798 --> 00:33:42.965]  I want to thank Harrison Smith and Troy and the rest of the crew for doing a superlative job as well, and all the great listeners and viewers that are tuned in.
[00:33:43.646 --> 00:33:45.909]  So going back to Harrison Smith, you're right.
[00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:55.293]  I've seen nothing on Twitter and Instagram and Facebook and in my email and on the street but support for the President of El Salvador.
[00:33:56.294 --> 00:33:57.074]  He is a listener.
[00:33:57.115 --> 00:33:59.116]  He is an anti-new world order person.
[00:33:59.136 --> 00:34:03.160]  He did an hour interview with Tucker Carlson out of his Florida studios, blew me away.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:07.204]  We're obviously wanting to get him on the show as soon as possible.
[00:34:07.865 --> 00:34:09.466]  Latin America wants to be Christian.
[00:34:09.486 --> 00:34:10.147]  They want to be free.
[00:34:10.791 --> 00:34:12.132]  People think Latin America is a failure.
[00:34:12.172 --> 00:34:14.234]  That was the IMF and World Bank the last 60 years.
[00:34:14.755 --> 00:34:17.557]  Latin America had two countries per capita richer than the U.S.
[00:34:19.059 --> 00:34:32.811]  and now places were incredibly wealthy like Argentina and then of course Venezuela had a higher per capita income in the 50s, 60s, and 70s than the U.S.
[00:34:33.532 --> 00:34:34.653]  We had the highest in the 50s.
[00:34:36.275 --> 00:34:41.355]   And then again, in the 90s, but we haven't since 'cause our jobs were sent to China.
[00:34:41.355 --> 00:34:46.355]  So Latin America could be a jewel and a destination.
[00:34:46.355 --> 00:34:51.155]   And I'd love to have it where they're successful, we're successful, we live there, they live here.
[00:34:51.155 --> 00:34:53.914]   They can come here, we can go there, but we can't have them implode.
[00:34:54.016 --> 00:34:55.816]  And then we bring all that here and we implode.
[00:34:55.836 --> 00:34:56.976]  And that's the globalist model.
[00:34:57.936 --> 00:35:04.898]  And when you have crime completely out of control, people don't go to dinner, people don't get their hair done, people don't get their car fixed, shops close, societies collapse.
[00:35:04.998 --> 00:35:10.519]  And that's what the globalists want with viruses and crime and homeless people everywhere.
[00:35:10.839 --> 00:35:11.639]  That's their plan.
[00:35:11.899 --> 00:35:14.800]  And that's why law and order is so incredibly important.
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:21.634]   And it's key to notice, Harrison, Look at the Washington Post articles, the New York Times, I know you've covered because I've watched the show.
[00:35:22.474 --> 00:35:26.457]  They are literally saying, we need to be arresting right-wingers and doing this for our thoughts.
[00:35:27.057 --> 00:35:28.878]  We need to be censoring and arresting people.
[00:35:28.918 --> 00:35:31.380]  I mean, that's the next level, but leaving MS-13 alone.
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:38.164]  I don't know if the crew was able to find that Nancy Pelosi clip saying that MS-13 are all God's children, but it's on record.
[00:35:38.244 --> 00:35:39.085]  Guys, did you find that?
[00:35:39.765 --> 00:35:40.666]  I forgot to ask during the break.
[00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:44.468]  You did find it.
[00:35:44.708 --> 00:35:45.329]  How long is the clip?
[00:35:45.369 --> 00:35:45.909]  I want to play that.
[00:35:50.316 --> 00:35:52.479]  Okay, the show's live.
[00:35:52.659 --> 00:35:56.383]  Add it in post just for continuity once we post the Bandai video.
[00:35:56.403 --> 00:35:57.384]  We don't have time to get to it.
[00:35:57.665 --> 00:35:58.205]  It's on record.
[00:35:58.245 --> 00:35:58.646]  She said it.
[00:35:59.667 --> 00:36:00.167]  Maybe do this.
[00:36:00.207 --> 00:36:02.010]  Maybe just cut down to like 30 seconds.
[00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.871]  I want to play a two-minute clip.
[00:36:04.648 --> 00:36:12.473]  In Harrison, I mean, this really is the solution if it's only targeted at a paramilitary group that doesn't follow the law and are terrorists.
[00:36:12.914 --> 00:36:21.899]  That's what you've got to do with people like this when they have tattoos of how many people they've killed and how proud they are that they're murderers and they're never going to be reformed and they're never going to stop.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.480]  I'm sorry, this is war.
[00:36:23.921 --> 00:36:30.445]  All you can do when it's an outside group destroying your country is kill the leadership and lock up their people till the cult is dead.
[00:36:30.905 --> 00:36:31.726]  What is your view on that?
[00:36:32.455 --> 00:36:33.496]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:36:33.816 --> 00:36:37.860]  And again, we had a great caller yesterday on American Journal who had tons of experience.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:43.265]  He'd gone down to El Salvador, talked to the people, and I mean, he was talking about just the transformation that's happened.
[00:36:43.325 --> 00:36:50.070]  Children running around on the street in neighborhoods where a couple years ago children would literally be killed for just being in the wrong neighborhood.
[00:36:51.291 --> 00:36:55.655]  It's a total transformation, and I think it's beyond just the crime crackdown.
[00:36:55.975 --> 00:37:00.338]  In fact, there was a guy on Twitter that was saying that he was blown away by El Salvador.
[00:37:00.378 --> 00:37:10.306]  He reaches out to lots of countries and their leadership, and the thing that he said about El Salvador was that it's all run now by family men in their prime age, from 35 to 50.
[00:37:10.746 --> 00:37:19.173]   And he basically, he talks about how, you know, he'd never experienced or never sensed such a Caring from the, from a national government.
[00:37:19.213 --> 00:37:21.915]  He says, I deal with people, you know, powerful people all the time.
[00:37:21.955 --> 00:37:22.956]  None of them seem to really care.
[00:37:23.256 --> 00:37:24.497]  These guys seem to really care.
[00:37:24.577 --> 00:37:32.383]  And he ends by saying, if you want to fix the world, elect fathers of integrity in their prime age, give them the latitude to make change, and that's it.
[00:37:32.443 --> 00:37:35.185]  They'll take responsibility for making the hard, unpopular calls.
[00:37:35.585 --> 00:37:38.267]  Anybody can open the money printers and say comforting lies.
[00:37:38.588 --> 00:37:41.370]  So it seems like this is a real transformation that's happening in El Salvador.
[00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.472]  And again, I've gotten nothing but positive response.
[00:37:44.492 --> 00:37:46.113]  1.5 million views on that video at this point.
[00:37:46.293 --> 00:37:48.934]  It was also retweeted by General Flynn on his official Twitter.
[00:37:49.414 --> 00:37:59.680]  And everybody that I've talked to from El Salvador has reached out just to say thank you for saying this because the mainstream media with Bukele has finally found an authoritarian that they don't like, right?
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:05.043]  They're all for all the authoritarian measures in the Western world regardless of who they're targeting or what they're about.
[00:38:05.844 --> 00:38:07.445]  They're all for Xi Jinping.
[00:38:07.465 --> 00:38:09.787]  They're all for the New World Order.
[00:38:09.927 --> 00:38:15.311]  But when somebody actually targets a criminal group that our criminal government's been working with, they totally freak out.
[00:38:15.331 --> 00:38:15.911]  You're absolutely right.
[00:38:15.951 --> 00:38:16.712]  Notice they're targeting.
[00:38:17.225 --> 00:38:20.648]  Working-age men who are supposed to put themselves in the way of tyrants.
[00:38:21.129 --> 00:38:24.672]  Working-age men that are supposed to know that they're the heart of the country to protect the women and children.
[00:38:25.092 --> 00:38:28.835]  That's why the globalists target masculinity in all the TV shows and all the movies.
[00:38:29.656 --> 00:38:30.897]  Not just here, but all over the world.
[00:38:30.957 --> 00:38:37.846]   That's what Hollywood does because they don't want men to know their mission to be hard-working, Guardians of the Civilization.
[00:38:37.886 --> 00:38:41.789]  And that's what scares them in just a few years, what this guy has been able to do.
[00:38:42.029 --> 00:38:53.556]  And let's not forget, Max Keiser, when this guy first got elected like three years ago, was going down there and they were setting up, you know, a Bitcoin energy, thermal energy from volcanoes around Bitcoin mining.
[00:38:53.957 --> 00:38:55.438]  He was saying, you got to go interview this guy.
[00:38:55.498 --> 00:38:57.299]  The future is El Salvador.
[00:38:58.079 --> 00:38:59.682]  Wait until you see what happens.
[00:39:00.122 --> 00:39:02.726]  And I wasn't rolling my eyes at Kaiser, but he is a trailblazer.
[00:39:02.746 --> 00:39:03.827]  We need to get him back on the show.
[00:39:04.108 --> 00:39:06.851]  But Kaiser is the guy's main financial advisor.
[00:39:07.212 --> 00:39:09.154]  Think how much that scares the New World Order, Harrison.
[00:39:09.595 --> 00:39:10.676]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:10.717 --> 00:39:18.404]   And you know, actually the clip that we retweeted out and that you just played, That was from December, early December of last year.
[00:39:18.544 --> 00:39:24.545]  So, you know, now all this video of the prison is going viral and people are seeing, which it is sort of horrifying, right?
[00:39:24.665 --> 00:39:27.025]  All of these guys with the tattoos, the way they're cowed.
[00:39:27.065 --> 00:39:29.186]  I mean, it's, it's sort of stunning footage.
[00:39:29.486 --> 00:39:42.650]   And so I wanted to go back and show that not only InfoWars is tomorrow's news today, we've been covering this guy for a while, even though a lot of people are just now finding out about him, but sort of lay the groundwork and show that speech that shows this isn't like a A punitive power grab.
[00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:44.952]  It really seems to come from something positive.
[00:39:45.413 --> 00:39:49.457]  And yeah, maybe the outcome of it, it looks crazy.
[00:39:49.497 --> 00:39:50.939]  I mean, we're seeing it on screen right now.
[00:39:51.179 --> 00:39:51.920]  It's a crazy thing.
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.483]  Well, imagine that's only 2,000 of the 40,000 they've arrested.
[00:39:55.563 --> 00:39:58.046]  And remember, he got in, what, three years ago?
[00:39:58.086 --> 00:39:59.327]  And I said, he really got in a year ago.
[00:39:59.347 --> 00:40:01.870]  They saw real success the first two years.
[00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:27.624]   So then the Congress finally Got elected that was for him and now that he's actually got a unified government 95% approval rating look it up folks and the crime rates down over 90% the economy's coming back It's so good and that's scaring the new world order folks because literally MS-13 was trained and created in US prisons Yes, it's a El Salvador gang, but it was created and what formed in Los Angeles and
[00:40:28.404 --> 00:40:29.445]  Well, 30-something years ago.
[00:40:29.485 --> 00:40:55.518]  It's a fascinating history, and how vicious they are, and how the media covers up the Satanism and the human sacrifices that if a business owner in New York City, or Los Angeles, California, or San Antonio, Texas, or in El Salvador doesn't pay them the money, doesn't let them put their 14-year-old daughter into prostitution, they come and butcher the family and sacrifice them to Satan.
[00:40:56.816 --> 00:41:00.199]  MS-13 literally is a satanic cult.
[00:41:00.739 --> 00:41:01.540]  Think about that, Harrison.
[00:41:02.146 --> 00:41:04.267]  Oh no, yeah, 100%.
[00:41:04.907 --> 00:41:18.012]  And that's the thing that Bukele said about the video where you see the 2,000 people, you know, it might seem like a lot of people in prison, but behind every one of those is dozens, you know, maybe hundreds of these horrific crimes, horrendous crimes.
[00:41:18.032 --> 00:41:20.212]  I don't even like getting into the details, but you're exactly right.
[00:41:20.232 --> 00:41:24.714]  I mean, they use brutality as a psychological lever to get people to submit to them.
[00:41:24.754 --> 00:41:26.975]  They're terrorists, they're Satanists, they're evil.
[00:41:28.368 --> 00:41:35.612]  And El Salvador, like the police in the U.S., had been overrun and defeated, and so the country had collapsed.
[00:41:35.692 --> 00:41:41.616]  They finally had to get ramped up tough, and then go in against them, and they've beaten them decisively and quickly.
[00:41:41.636 --> 00:41:43.557]  But people say, well, this looks dangerous.
[00:41:43.597 --> 00:41:50.001]  Well, of many thousands, they report, of police have been killed in the last three years, bringing things to this point in the military.
[00:41:50.714 --> 00:42:06.544]  They're in a war, they're committed, they're winning, prosperity came back, and as long as it doesn't get used against political opponents or other groups that are citizens, this is the response we should be seeing to the drug cartels on our border that are doing many of the same things and working with MS-13.
[00:42:06.583 --> 00:42:12.864]   It's time to start arresting them and trying them with speedy trials and to start hanging
[00:42:12.864 --> 00:42:18.422]   their asses and to start hanging the leftists that launder the money and help run this because
[00:42:18.422 --> 00:42:23.282]   that's why Nancy Pelosi is allied with this and they know that if they have a criminal
[00:42:23.282 --> 00:42:28.543]   gang that can commit, I've been told this by high level people in Army Special Operations,
[00:42:28.543 --> 00:42:30.282]  you name it, five, six years ago.
[00:42:30.282 --> 00:42:35.143]   And then later it came out in the news that the globalists are using MS-13 to commit assassinations
[00:42:35.518 --> 00:42:39.139]  The MS-13 15-year-old that does the assassination doesn't even know who gave him the order.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:47.123]  It's total plausible deniability, just like the CIA used Mafia to help kill JFK, was one of the three teams they had there, plausible deniability.
[00:42:47.483 --> 00:42:49.544]  The old Italian Mafia, which is nothing compared to these people.
[00:42:50.004 --> 00:42:52.085]  And so, this is what they're doing.
[00:42:52.466 --> 00:42:57.508]  So, MS-13 is an arm of the deep state, and Bukele understands that.
[00:42:58.666 --> 00:43:09.434]  Absolutely, and we've heard Kamala Harris say that the correct response to the crisis at the southern border is to basically send money in unlimited amounts to the countries south of the border.
[00:43:09.674 --> 00:43:22.143]  Well, if you want to stop the flood of people from the south into America, maybe more Bukeles need to take the reins in Latin America and South America and stop the violence that's driving people out of those countries and towards America.
[00:43:22.423 --> 00:43:22.903]  Well, that's right.
[00:43:23.383 --> 00:43:23.924]  Exactly.
[00:43:24.364 --> 00:43:24.724]  Exactly.
[00:43:24.744 --> 00:43:25.664]  We're going to break, folks.
[00:43:25.684 --> 00:43:26.485]  Didn't block this hour.
[00:43:26.525 --> 00:43:27.265]  We need your support.

[00:43:34.087 --> 00:43:34.968]  We need your support.

[00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:40.510]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:41.230]  Please go there now.
[00:43:41.310 --> 00:44:00.910]  Keep this type of powerful information on the air.
[00:44:00.969 --> 00:44:01.910]  That is a hellish future.
[00:44:02.431 --> 00:44:11.419]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsware.com.
[00:44:11.839 --> 00:44:17.304]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:44:17.444 --> 00:44:19.406]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:44:19.986 --> 00:44:25.132]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHore.com.
[00:44:25.372 --> 00:44:29.017]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:44:29.317 --> 00:44:34.863]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:44:35.204 --> 00:44:37.286]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[00:44:38.067 --> 00:44:42.369]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, final segment with the great Harrison Smith.
[00:44:42.189 --> 00:44:46.309]   Go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:49.528]   and donate them to the library or get them to the local school.
[00:44:49.528 --> 00:44:52.368]   This is an InfoWar, I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[00:44:52.368 --> 00:44:56.208]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, final segment with the great Harrison Smith.
[00:44:56.208 --> 00:44:59.189]   When I say the great Harrison Smith, he's always been a smart guy,
[00:44:59.189 --> 00:45:04.289]   worked for us many years as a reporter and a host, but the show gets better and better
[00:45:04.289 --> 00:45:10.489]   and the production crew that produces the show with the guests and all the information
[00:45:10.489 --> 00:45:12.329]  is just over the top great.
[00:45:12.262 --> 00:45:13.082]  8 a.m.
[00:45:13.163 --> 00:45:14.163]  Central, every morning.
[00:45:14.683 --> 00:45:16.885]  Infowars.com, Ford's last show and Bandai Video.
[00:45:17.205 --> 00:45:35.500]   Harrison, there's another wrinkle to this, or another layer to this onion, and that's Biden comes out two years ago and says the number one threat in America and the official terrorism plan of the executive branch It's not the Russians, not the CHICOMS, not MS-13, not the Mexican Mafia.
[00:45:36.621 --> 00:45:39.284]  No, it is the American people and white supremacy.
[00:45:39.324 --> 00:45:41.806]  If you actually go to the real crime statistics, it basically doesn't even exist.
[00:45:41.866 --> 00:45:43.727]  It's like super rare, okay?
[00:45:43.767 --> 00:45:56.438]  I mean, maybe white supremacists kill like 10 people a year or something, but they hype the living hell out of it and then say anyone that is against lockdowns or open borders or forced injections or talks about election fraud is a terrorist.
[00:45:57.184 --> 00:45:59.184]  and needs to be shut down, needs to be silenced.
[00:45:59.184 --> 00:46:04.004]   And then we have an article on Infowars.com about the whole rigged trial of Joe Biggs and the Proud
[00:46:04.004 --> 00:46:07.184]   Boys, who when the police opened the barricades, they went in.
[00:46:07.184 --> 00:46:09.184]  They even tried to stop some people being violent.
[00:46:09.184 --> 00:46:13.184]   Here they are in solitary confinement for two plus years, or now over two years,
[00:46:13.184 --> 00:46:17.184]   and they're being railroaded by a corrupt judiciary that we know DC's in.
[00:46:17.065 --> 00:46:17.765]  's famous for.
[00:46:17.786 --> 00:46:20.989]  And so there's the left wanting to keep people.
[00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:24.393]  When the left burns down buildings, Kamala Harris bells them out of jail.
[00:46:24.413 --> 00:46:28.839]  When the left shoots cops, Kamala Harris bells them out of jail when she was a vice presidential candidate.
[00:46:29.443 --> 00:46:34.611]  That's all sweet and wonderful, hundreds of millions of dollars, you know, raised for the Summer of Rage in 2000.
[00:46:35.051 --> 00:46:45.246]  But oh no, don't lock up an MS-13 guy that has been arrested more than a dozen times and spent years in prison and committed multiple murders that he admits to and has all over his tattoos saying he did it.
[00:46:45.686 --> 00:46:46.988]  And they know them as 13.
[00:46:47.929 --> 00:46:50.872]  That's approved by the head guys when you get those tattoos.
[00:46:51.313 --> 00:46:52.935]  That's your stripes, your sergeant stripes.
[00:46:52.955 --> 00:46:54.336]  That's a record.
[00:46:54.377 --> 00:46:56.920]  That's your rap sheet that they tattoo on their bodies.
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:58.882]  Oh, these portable God's children.
[00:46:58.922 --> 00:46:59.783]  Let's be nice to them.
[00:46:59.903 --> 00:47:05.998]   But the American people Oh, they all need to be locked up for January 6th.
[00:47:06.058 --> 00:47:07.298]  It's the biggest terror threat ever.
[00:47:07.578 --> 00:47:09.719]  And then all Trump supporters are all populist.
[00:47:09.739 --> 00:47:11.960]  You're all terrorists, too, because of this.
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.240]  It's so transparent, Harrison.
[00:47:13.721 --> 00:47:17.902]  Yeah, and not only is the mainstream media celebrating what's going on in this country, they're demanding more of it.
[00:47:17.942 --> 00:47:20.603]  They want more Trump supporters to be thrown into prison.
[00:47:21.244 --> 00:47:22.465]  It almost goes even beyond that.
[00:47:22.505 --> 00:47:28.930]  We showed a video yesterday sort of in conjunction with talking about El Salvador, which was a Safeway in California somewhere, right?
[00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:33.935]  A grocery store that had, you know, bars on the window and you can't just check out and leave.
[00:47:33.975 --> 00:47:37.998]  You have to get, you know, there's a gate there and you have to show your receipt for the gate to go up.
[00:47:38.038 --> 00:47:44.024]  So, you know, essentially we're dealing with the situation where we can either put the criminals in prison or we're all gonna live in prison.
[00:47:44.364 --> 00:47:44.564]  Right?
[00:47:44.624 --> 00:47:52.050]  Either we put the bad people away and separate them from society or the whole society has to have bars around it and has to become a prison planet.
[00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:52.931]  You just hit the key.
[00:47:53.111 --> 00:47:53.971]  You just hit the key.
[00:47:53.991 --> 00:47:56.974]  In a speech, I forget where he can pull it up online, of Eisenhower.
[00:47:56.994 --> 00:47:58.695]  He was president in 1960.
[00:47:59.215 --> 00:48:03.739]  He said, I can give you total safety, but I got to lock you in a tiny, you know, 200 square foot cell.
[00:48:04.728 --> 00:48:23.297]  And so now the new smart cities are 200-foot coffin apartments, and you've all got to be scanned and tracked everywhere you go, but the illegal aliens aren't scanned, the criminals aren't scanned, so they use that outside threat to get us to then be herded into, quote, safety zones where the good people are in prisons, and the globalist criminals and the low-level criminals work together to keep us under their control.
[00:48:23.597 --> 00:48:24.317]  You just nailed it.
[00:48:24.617 --> 00:48:39.907]  Well, and to go back to your point about the tattoos, to expand on that a little bit, because I saw, I think it was CNN or some mainstream media, you know, corporation said these alleged gang members, well, in El Salvador, if you have a gang tattoo and you're not in the gang, they will kill you for that.
[00:48:39.987 --> 00:48:43.590]  So to have these tattoos is proof that they were part of the gang.
[00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:46.352]  So they're not locking up just random people with tattoos.
[00:48:46.372 --> 00:48:47.392]  They're locking up criminals.
[00:48:47.432 --> 00:48:48.473]  They all went through a judicial process.
[00:48:48.313 --> 00:48:52.353]   process according, I guess, and we can have some skepticism about that
[00:48:52.353 --> 00:48:56.192]   because we do want to be on our toes for authoritarianism, but as far as I can
[00:48:56.192 --> 00:48:59.751]   tell it all seems totally legit. The criminals that are in jail now deserve
[00:48:59.751 --> 00:49:03.273]   to be there for the horrific or horrific crimes that they've committed.
[00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:08.032]   Exactly. And on the subject of tattoos, you know, all those different Aboriginal groups do
[00:49:08.032 --> 00:49:11.913]   tattoos when they do rites of passage or they get married or they kill their
[00:49:11.913 --> 00:49:14.992]  first warrior or whatever.
[00:49:13.148 --> 00:49:14.308]  And it's the same thing.
[00:49:14.388 --> 00:49:16.610]  Nobody until the 70s had tattoos.
[00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:21.433]  It wasn't in a motorcycle gang or wasn't a special military unit or hadn't done something special.
[00:49:21.473 --> 00:49:24.175]  You didn't get those unless you'd been part of that.
[00:49:24.355 --> 00:49:29.962]   And If you go back hundreds of years ago, sailors would get a special tattoo when they crossed the equator for the first time.
[00:49:30.382 --> 00:49:32.505]  Or when they circumnavigated the world, you get another tattoo.
[00:49:32.805 --> 00:49:35.729]  These are a rap sheet of your good or bad things you've done.
[00:49:35.989 --> 00:49:36.790]  You're 100% right.
[00:49:37.151 --> 00:49:39.914]  Harrison Smith, 8 a.m., weekdays, Infowars.com.
[00:49:39.934 --> 00:49:40.295]  Stay with us.
[00:49:41.676 --> 00:49:47.281]  And we are now into hour number two on this final day of February, the 28th day of February, 2023.
[00:49:48.021 --> 00:49:54.747]  The great health ranger, Mike Adams, is loaded for bear from his new studios in Central Texas, beaming into our studios.
[00:49:55.127 --> 00:49:56.528]  He's got a bunch of big guests lined up.
[00:49:56.568 --> 00:49:57.629]  He takes over in two minutes.
[00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:09.479]  But last hour, I got so hot and heavy on them admitting gain of function, that the COVID virus was lab made, vindicating everything, what's happening in El Salvador, all the other issues that I did not plug.
[00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:15.695]  One of the biggest enemies of InfoWars is actually Alex Jones, because when I plug at least once an hour, we can fund the operation.
[00:50:15.715 --> 00:50:17.456]  When I forget and don't do it, we can't fund it.
[00:50:17.796 --> 00:50:19.218]  Plus, we've got great products you need.
[00:50:19.618 --> 00:50:37.128]   If you want to continue to see hardcore, game-changing, tip of the spear, 98% accuracy that just is setting brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere, Stay with InfoWars, pray for InfoWars, spread the word about InfoWars, and buy product at InfoWars.
[00:50:37.548 --> 00:50:40.528]  And I can tell you how many outside groups go and test the products we sell.
[00:50:40.889 --> 00:50:45.449]  Like Mike Adams is famous for his big testing lab, where he tests all sorts of products, plus his supplements.
[00:50:46.349 --> 00:50:48.050]  And he, I didn't even know this happened with a family member.
[00:50:48.370 --> 00:51:00.432]  He was given, a family member that had some neurological issues, CBD oil, there's all the studies, it's really good CBD oil, it really helps all sorts of neurological things, Parkinson's, epilepsy, narcolepsy, the list goes on and on, joint pain, you name it.
[00:51:01.761 --> 00:51:07.143]  And he went and tested ours in his testing lab, checked it as degrees, and said, this is the highest quality we've seen.
[00:51:07.583 --> 00:51:10.163]  We've seen another brand that's good, but this is the very top.
[00:51:10.484 --> 00:51:14.365]  This should be $160 a bottle for the 1,000 milligram that he puts out.
[00:51:14.785 --> 00:51:15.425]  And that's true.
[00:51:15.465 --> 00:51:16.805]  They recommended we sell it for $150.
[00:51:16.965 --> 00:51:22.747]  I went to these folks that own a big company that's one of the top distributors in the country of wide-spectrum CBD.
[00:51:23.647 --> 00:51:26.188]  And they said, we recommend $150 retail, then discount it $100.
[00:51:27.909 --> 00:51:32.792]   Well, I'm not going to do I'm not going to do 200% markup.
[00:51:34.033 --> 00:51:38.176]  So, at $67, there's a 100% markup to fund ourselves.
[00:51:38.416 --> 00:51:46.983]  You're getting the best CBD, 1000mg, 25mg, and 10mg, depending on the one you want, at over 50% what you're going to get just anywhere else.
[00:51:47.043 --> 00:51:48.064]  That's with a discount.
[00:51:48.824 --> 00:51:55.969]   It's about 35% After the discount.
[00:51:55.989 --> 00:51:58.510]  So I bet if you look at retail, it's like a 70% discount.
[00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:03.093]  The point is, is that point blank, everybody knows CBD is great.
[00:52:03.153 --> 00:52:05.294]  Doctors are prescribing it everywhere, even though it's not prescription.
[00:52:05.715 --> 00:52:06.755]  This is the best you're going to get.
[00:52:06.955 --> 00:52:10.618]  InfowarStore.com and it funds the Infowar, a total 360 win.
[00:52:10.718 --> 00:52:12.739]  Only way we fail is we don't take action.
[00:52:12.759 --> 00:52:16.461]  And I know less than 1% of the viewers who I love and I think, I'm not bitching, buy the product.
[00:52:16.861 --> 00:52:20.023]  If just one more percent would just do it, we wouldn't just be good.
[00:52:20.364 --> 00:52:21.184]  We could expand.
[00:52:21.624 --> 00:52:22.465]  So we're not going anywhere.
[00:52:23.419 --> 00:52:25.060]  Those of you that have bought the products, you know who you are.
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:27.582]  Those who haven't, hey, keep spreading the word, keep praying for us.
[00:52:27.722 --> 00:52:30.564]  And if you want to experience great CBD, try it out, get a bottle.
[00:52:30.584 --> 00:52:31.985]  And I think you're going to be a repeat customer.
[00:52:32.406 --> 00:52:41.032]  Also, our prebiotics sold out for over a year that creates all these great enzymes and amino acids in the gut that are anti-cancer and so good and for regularity.
[00:52:41.632 --> 00:52:42.473]  It's back in stock.
[00:52:42.593 --> 00:52:50.938]   Our bone broth is the best bone broth out there because the other ones don't have bee pollen, chaga mushroom, and magnesium and Two more, it goes on and on.
[00:52:51.358 --> 00:52:52.759]  It's back in stock, 40% off.
[00:52:53.199 --> 00:52:56.700]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:03.801]  And that's what makes this broadcast possible.
[00:53:04.161 --> 00:53:05.762]  Check out the other products while you're there.
[00:53:06.142 --> 00:53:07.602]  We're about to run out of the signed books.
[00:53:08.142 --> 00:53:10.123]  It's a fundraiser, unsigned, we got plenty of.
[00:53:10.503 --> 00:53:12.943]  Great reset, World of the World, it was number one for several months last year.
[00:53:13.284 --> 00:53:15.164]  Thanks to all the viewers and listeners.
[00:53:16.149 --> 00:53:16.989]  The Awakening is here.
[00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:18.310]  The Chain Reaction is here.
[00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:21.591]  It's a very exciting time, but we've got more work to do.
[00:53:21.651 --> 00:53:22.852]  We can't rest on our laurels.
[00:53:23.112 --> 00:53:26.633]  We're a team, and I thank you and I salute you for your honor and your will and your courage.
[00:53:26.853 --> 00:53:29.214]  The great Mike Adams, the next two hours takes over.
[00:53:31.621 --> 00:53:31.801]  All right.
[00:53:31.821 --> 00:53:32.302]  Well, thank you.
[00:53:32.722 --> 00:53:33.303]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:53:33.683 --> 00:53:34.965]  It's great to be on the show here today.
[00:53:35.265 --> 00:53:37.648]  We've got an incredible lineup right here, straight ahead.
[00:53:37.728 --> 00:53:45.396]  Jeffrey Prather coming up at the bottom of this hour to talk about fifth generation warfare, sabotage of infrastructure and so much more.
[00:53:45.957 --> 00:53:48.740]  We're also going to be joined at the bottom of this hour.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:49.581]  I'm sorry.
[00:53:49.921 --> 00:53:51.662]  Yeah, Jeffrey Prather's coming on here shortly.
[00:53:51.882 --> 00:53:58.164]  And then at the bottom of this hour, Eric Coppolino joining us to talk about the East Palestine train wreck chemical bomb.
[00:53:58.504 --> 00:54:04.927]  We've got new information there that's come to light about the EPA's actions and also the diversion of the toxic chemicals.
[00:54:05.447 --> 00:54:07.488]  They were supposed to be sent to Texas.
[00:54:07.568 --> 00:54:11.350]  Reportedly 500,000 gallons were already received in Texas.
[00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:22.074]  Some of that has been diverted to Indiana now, and there are lawsuits flying all over the place, and a lot of people experiencing new injuries now when they return to East Palestine.
[00:54:22.514 --> 00:54:26.416]  So again, Eric Coppolino will be joining us for a full hour to cover that.
[00:54:26.476 --> 00:54:30.098]  And then we have Brian Festa, attorney for We the Patriots.
[00:54:30.738 --> 00:54:55.268]  USA is going to be joining us at the bottom of the third hour here on the Alex Jones Show about a lawsuit that is being filed with lots of victims with exposure to these toxic chemicals and seemingly the inability of Norfolk Southern to move quickly in evacuating people who were exposed and many other issues coming up in that lawsuit.
[00:54:55.768 --> 00:55:01.951]   So all of that is coming straight ahead, but our first guest coming up here shortly We'll be Jeffrey Prather.
[00:55:02.591 --> 00:55:23.420]  And he is, of course, a former DEA, former top operations guy, certain kinds of... I don't know how much we can say about Jeffrey Prather, but he's been in the thick of it, and he's been blowing the whistle, and he's working to help America save itself from the takedown that is taking place right now.
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:31.705]   Now, one thing I want to bring your attention to, folks, is a story From the Wall Street Journal, S.O.S.
[00:55:31.925 --> 00:55:32.625]  for the U.S.
[00:55:32.766 --> 00:55:33.726]  Electric Grid.
[00:55:34.227 --> 00:55:40.872]  Wall Street Journal article showed up yesterday, and it's authored by the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:55:41.412 --> 00:55:48.578]  And this story confirms exactly what myself and Alex Jones and others have been warning about for a number of years.
[00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:52.702]  It confirms that there is a deliberate takedown of the power grid.
[00:55:53.675 --> 00:56:03.862]  Affecting the United States, but especially in this case the eastern states, that as coal-fired power plants are taken offline, there are no sufficient replacements.
[00:56:04.303 --> 00:56:09.907]  There's no real effort to bring back any kind of capacity that could keep the system running for people.
[00:56:10.627 --> 00:56:19.474]  And so unless something changes, we're looking at rolling blackouts across eastern states, that's 13 states, affecting 65 million people.
[00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:24.151]  The Wall Street Journal, now, confirming this.
[00:56:24.572 --> 00:56:32.676]  Again, InfoWars, tomorrow's news today, because Alex and others have been talking about this for many years, and now here it is confirmed by the Wall Street Journal.
[00:56:33.196 --> 00:56:42.682]  The point is, the green cult takedown of the US power grid is attempting to thrust the United States into a third world existence.
[00:56:43.342 --> 00:56:55.933]  Where you will have no reliable power grid, which means you'll have no reliable industry, no employers that can stay online, and you won't even be able to have power in your own home reliably.
[00:56:56.033 --> 00:56:56.634]  And guess what?
[00:56:57.074 --> 00:57:00.397]  If you went out and bought an electric vehicle, good luck charging it.
[00:57:01.198 --> 00:57:05.603]  You won't be able to charge it when the power grid is down, obviously, and that's all by design.
[00:57:06.204 --> 00:57:09.908]  So just one more example of how we nailed it here.
[00:57:10.348 --> 00:57:13.112]  You all, the supporters of InfoWars, you nailed it.
[00:57:13.692 --> 00:57:15.314]  And by the way, thank you for your support.
[00:57:15.594 --> 00:57:18.978]  Alex mentioned the CBD oil at the beginning of this segment.
[00:57:19.904 --> 00:57:20.865]  I have to concur.
[00:57:21.345 --> 00:57:24.748]  The CBD product from Infowarsstore.com is truly outstanding.
[00:57:25.288 --> 00:57:29.231]  I've got one of my family members on it, and it's working wonders.
[00:57:29.431 --> 00:57:30.512]  It is highly potent.
[00:57:30.572 --> 00:57:31.373]  It's very effective.
[00:57:31.453 --> 00:57:35.396]  We've tested it in the laboratory, and it's an extraordinary value.
[00:57:35.836 --> 00:57:37.537]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:37.898 --> 00:57:39.179]  Check out the CBD oil.
[00:57:39.199 --> 00:57:45.584]  I think that's the 1,000 milligram bottle that I'm referring to there, but there are some other formats that are available as well.
[00:57:46.204 --> 00:58:05.379]  Now, what we're going to be talking about here coming up shortly, again, Jeffrey Prather will be joining us, we're going to be talking about what I call molecular terrorism, which is the new form of asymmetrical terrorism that unleashes cheap toxic chemicals to cause massive economic and medical damage across the population at large.
[00:58:06.019 --> 00:58:16.287]   Also, we're seeing people getting sick as they return to East Palestine, even when they felt better, After leaving, so they were there during the toxic event.
[00:58:16.807 --> 00:58:17.528]  They got sick.
[00:58:17.568 --> 00:58:22.932]  They got weird rashes and symptoms and bronchial effects and difficulty breathing.
[00:58:22.992 --> 00:58:24.213]  Some people were coughing up blood.
[00:58:24.613 --> 00:58:25.333]  Animals were dying.
[00:58:25.934 --> 00:58:29.136]  Many of these people evacuated and then they got better.
[00:58:29.797 --> 00:58:32.939]  And then as they returned to the town, their symptoms are coming back.
[00:58:33.419 --> 00:58:33.659]  Why?
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:37.022]  Because there's something still in the air, folks.
[00:58:37.462 --> 00:58:38.863]  Because the chemicals are still there.
[00:58:39.503 --> 00:58:45.026]  And this is something that's not being talked about by the EPA, nor by Ohio state officials.
[00:58:45.487 --> 00:58:47.408]  But we're going to talk about it here on this show.
[00:58:47.748 --> 00:58:54.332]  We're also going to cover how the EPA can actually fake the tests for dioxins and other chemicals.
[00:58:54.992 --> 00:58:58.293]  How do we know the EPA even wants to conduct an accurate test?
[00:58:58.733 --> 00:58:59.854]  My guess is they don't.
[00:59:00.334 --> 00:59:10.397]  Actually, my guess is the EPA has already conducted dioxin testing and they're sitting on the results, but they just don't want you to know what those results really are.
[00:59:11.197 --> 00:59:14.098]  So we're going to talk about that later on in the show as well.
[00:59:14.698 --> 00:59:20.518]   And then how Law enforcement uses fake lab tests as well.
[00:59:20.338 --> 00:59:26.177]   Well, I want to do a segment on that to explain how all across America, even though we support
[00:59:26.177 --> 00:59:30.738]   law enforcement, we support the men and women in blue, we want safe societies.
[00:59:30.738 --> 00:59:36.737]  [MUSIC]
[00:59:36.737 --> 00:59:41.458]   Last year, we published a report entitled evidence that US government
[00:59:41.458 --> 00:59:45.298]  targeted red states with deadly batch of vaccine.
[00:59:45.502 --> 00:59:47.803]  A story that most outlets ignored.
[00:59:48.264 --> 00:59:55.148]  Private leaked documents from the CDC show a list of expiry dates and only certain lots are included.
[00:59:55.888 --> 00:59:59.971]  The very same lots found to be highly toxic in part of Cooper's database.
[01:00:00.891 --> 01:00:09.521]  This mode of deployment allows governments the ability to direct deadly batches into specific populations, such as red states.
[01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:20.033]  Analysis of the number of dying per 100,000 vaccinated in 50 states shows us that the overwhelming majority of vaccine deaths are happening in red states.
[01:00:21.094 --> 01:00:36.014]  Second smartest guy in the world on Substack also reported on it and has recently published an update writing that now we have a more robust and far more damning view of this carefully distributed depopulation scheme.
[01:00:37.115 --> 01:00:57.809]  Back in Ohio of 2021, the ExposÃ© publishes a report on data found in the USA's VAERS, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which reveals that 100% of COVID-19 vaccine deaths had been caused by just 5% of the batches.
[01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:00.031]  Batches that can be identified.
[01:01:00.451 --> 01:01:03.754]  And these deadly batches were not distributed evenly.
[01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:18.527]  The top eight states with the highest vaccination death rate, Kentucky, Arkansas, West Virginia, Montana, Alaska, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Tennessee, are all red states.
[01:01:20.008 --> 01:01:23.271]  19 of the top 24 on the list are red states.
[01:01:23.731 --> 01:01:28.616]  And California has been the least affected by the deadly lots of COVID vaccine.
[01:01:29.384 --> 01:01:44.213]  The numbers show that Kentucky has a 1,900% worse vaccination death rate than California, suggesting that Kentucky received 20 times the amount of deadly batches than California did.
[01:01:44.953 --> 01:01:54.259]  Florida, number 20 on the list of most vaccine deaths per vaccination, received three times the amount of deadly batches than California.
[01:01:54.759 --> 01:01:59.943]  With its vaccination death rate at 200% higher than California's.
[01:02:01.344 --> 01:02:10.090]  The author points out that these deadly batches would be better classified as rapid kill lots and slow kill lots.
[01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:14.473]  As we are now seeing more evidence that they kill over time.
[01:02:15.954 --> 01:02:21.238]  And the evidence shows that red states were targeted with the rapid kill shots.
[01:02:22.139 --> 01:02:35.897]  This would go along with the United Nations Agenda 2030 plan, which seeks to move the entire population into crowded cities and federalize all of flyover country in the name of climate change.
[01:02:37.179 --> 01:02:42.426]  They have less than seven years to accomplish this, and they are deadly serious about it.
[01:02:43.367 --> 01:02:53.460]  The US government is in lockstep with the United Nations, and they will resort to murder and democide to accomplish their goals of total control.
[01:02:54.301 --> 01:02:59.685]  Many are suggesting that this is what is happening in East Palestine, Ohio, right now.
[01:03:00.405 --> 01:03:08.911]  The people of America are under attack by their own government, who is never going to quit until they accomplish their goals, or unless they are stopped.
[01:03:09.632 --> 01:03:12.432]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:21.032]  [Music]
[01:03:21.032 --> 01:03:31.032]  [No audio]
[01:03:31.032 --> 01:03:51.030]  [No audio]
[01:03:51.030 --> 01:03:58.030]   ...rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like, at least in government.
[01:03:58.443 --> 01:04:04.145]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[01:04:04.245 --> 01:04:06.385]  The left have wised up to this.
[01:04:06.585 --> 01:04:11.967]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it.
[01:04:11.987 --> 01:04:13.068]  The social media giants.
[01:04:13.348 --> 01:04:13.708]  And they are.
[01:04:14.088 --> 01:04:19.713]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[01:04:19.813 --> 01:04:24.537]  So far the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[01:04:24.657 --> 01:04:32.343]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[01:04:32.483 --> 01:04:38.226]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[01:04:38.466 --> 01:04:45.149]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[01:04:45.509 --> 01:04:55.274]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press working with big tech.
[01:04:55.919 --> 01:04:57.200]  People know what's true.
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:58.220]  They can smell it.
[01:04:58.721 --> 01:05:03.623]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:05:04.164 --> 01:05:06.165]  In a free country, everyone can be heard.
[01:05:06.205 --> 01:05:09.787]  In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be heard.
[01:05:09.687 --> 01:05:16.687]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:05:16.687 --> 01:05:25.687]  [Music]
[01:05:25.687 --> 01:05:30.687]  InfoWars has been banned.
[01:05:30.663 --> 01:05:31.323]  Arrested.
[01:05:34.585 --> 01:05:35.886]  Attacked and threatened.
[01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:39.028]  Because we are effective.
[01:05:39.088 --> 01:05:42.169]  The Great Awakening is here.
[01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:44.151]  Go to Banned.Video.
[01:05:44.851 --> 01:05:46.992]  Download the videos and share.
[01:05:48.913 --> 01:05:58.028]   Support the Information War at InfoWarsStore.com And never give up the fight.
[01:05:58.388 --> 01:06:19.999]  InfoWars.com Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.641]  InfoWars.com, yeah.
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:30.082]  If you don't watch it, you're gonna end up like Jason Adderley's boy.
[01:06:31.663 --> 01:06:33.084]  Deal me out this hand, Jason.
[01:06:34.245 --> 01:06:35.245]  I'm about to bust.
[01:06:36.106 --> 01:06:36.786]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:06:36.846 --> 01:06:38.067]  I thought this was the bathroom.
[01:06:38.247 --> 01:06:39.328]  Oh, good lord!
[01:06:41.469 --> 01:06:41.909]  Scanning.
[01:06:42.830 --> 01:06:44.091]  Control.
[01:06:44.271 --> 01:06:46.372]  Manipulate scientific data.
[01:06:46.392 --> 01:06:46.792]  Takeover.
[01:06:46.933 --> 01:06:47.293]  Blast.
[01:06:47.333 --> 01:06:47.793]  Control.
[01:06:47.853 --> 01:06:48.914]  World government.
[01:06:49.054 --> 01:06:50.175]  Shut down infrastructure.
[01:06:50.295 --> 01:06:51.936]  Shiver everything to China.
[01:06:52.016 --> 01:06:53.617]  Look at this person.
[01:06:57.582 --> 01:07:04.582]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:07:04.582 --> 01:07:16.182]   The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[01:07:16.192 --> 01:07:29.998]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[01:07:30.138 --> 01:07:34.180]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum through full space.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:38.642]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[01:07:38.883 --> 01:07:42.825]  What we envisioned a hundred years ago, twenty years ago, is now reality.
[01:07:43.665 --> 01:07:59.775]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[01:08:00.655 --> 01:08:01.676]  All right, welcome back, folks.
[01:08:01.716 --> 01:08:13.345]  Mike Adams here on the Alex Jones Show, and we're going to be joined by Jeffrey Prather here in just a minute to talk about the sabotage of the infrastructure, what's happening in America, fifth generational warfare, and a little bit more.
[01:08:13.365 --> 01:08:14.185]  I just want to apologize.
[01:08:14.546 --> 01:08:16.868]  We had a couple of video synchronization glitches there.
[01:08:16.888 --> 01:08:17.668]  Got it all worked out.
[01:08:17.988 --> 01:08:19.149]  Happy to be joining you today.
[01:08:19.409 --> 01:08:34.027]   And remember, we've got Eric Capolino coming up, too, in the next segment to talk about dioxins and other toxic chemicals that are falling out from the whole train wreck, literal train wreck Wreck-It-Ohio. So we're joined by Jeffrey Prather right now.
[01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:39.618]   Mr. Prather, sir, welcome to the show. It's great to have you on.
[01:08:39.618 --> 01:08:45.958]   Good to be with you again, Mike. It's always good to have you on.
[01:08:44.223 --> 01:09:08.852]  I'm glad you're doing well, and you do excellent analysis on so many subjects, but I wanted to ask you, starting with, what is your take on the food infrastructure takedowns, now the energy infrastructure takedowns, and we even have the Wall Street Journal openly admitting that, you know, putting out an SOS now saying that 13 eastern states are not going to have a reliable power grid because they're not replacing, you know, the fossil fuel systems that are taken offline.
[01:09:09.172 --> 01:09:10.612]  What do you make of all of this, Jeffrey?
[01:09:10.793 --> 01:09:11.793]  Give us your best analysis.
[01:09:14.284 --> 01:09:29.178]  Well, the covert war by our government against us, and unfortunately, the military that I served in, is comprehensive and encompassing, very similar to the overt proxy war in Ukraine.
[01:09:29.939 --> 01:09:33.863]  But in East Palestine, Ohio, it is particularly bad.
[01:09:33.883 --> 01:09:36.125]  Team America, Ohio was there on the ground.
[01:09:37.125 --> 01:09:40.787]  My friend, Lieutenant Colonel Doc Pete Chambers was there as well.
[01:09:40.807 --> 01:09:48.289]  And it looks like that the vinyl chloride is not even the worst element there.
[01:09:49.089 --> 01:09:59.393]  It's also 17 injection wells that are getting radioactive heavy water from Kentucky, West Virginia.
[01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:03.995]  Pennsylvania injected in there and coming back up to the surface.
[01:10:04.755 --> 01:10:10.878]  And that's part of the destruction on top of the food processing plants and the chickens being destroyed.
[01:10:10.898 --> 01:10:24.763]  And this is a complete resource siege happening globally, but simultaneously happening in America while it is happening in Ukraine as well.
[01:10:25.224 --> 01:10:28.045]  So it's much worse than people have thought.
[01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:39.539]  Jeffrey, don't you wonder why, I mean, surely the people carrying this out realize that the American people will notice when they have rolling blackouts, right?
[01:10:39.999 --> 01:10:46.423]  They will notice as more and more food scarcity emerges in the grocery stores over the next year or so.
[01:10:47.704 --> 01:10:54.529]  How do you think that the people in charge of this obvious sabotage, these takedowns, how do they think they're going to get away with it?
[01:10:55.129 --> 01:10:55.630]  Any ideas?
[01:10:58.246 --> 01:11:02.969]  Well, they don't study history, they don't study scripture, they haven't looked at Sri Lanka.
[01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:04.710]  It's an echo chamber.
[01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:07.371]  They think they're really smart, but they're just really ambitious.
[01:11:07.391 --> 01:11:13.275]  They just talk at their Davos conferences, and they're not aware of really what's happening at all.
[01:11:13.955 --> 01:11:18.418]  The perfect example of that is Ukraine, where Bakhmut is about to fold.
[01:11:18.498 --> 01:11:25.542]  Wagner Group has encircled that, even in the midst of Rasputin's Caesar, which is broken roads.
[01:11:26.262 --> 01:11:30.083]  And once that happens, that they will be able to move across there.
[01:11:30.583 --> 01:11:35.605]  And they're not noticing that the American people has turned against them completely.
[01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:38.366]  And no one will be able to carry this out.
[01:11:38.386 --> 01:11:41.227]  But things are still too easy in America.
[01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:48.429]  The American population is still unfortunately very soft, very drugged up, fattened up, dumbed down.
[01:11:49.289 --> 01:11:51.130]  And things just aren't that bad yet.
[01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.550]  Okay.
[01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:53.231]  All right.
[01:11:53.371 --> 01:11:54.511]  Well, that's kind of scary.
[01:11:54.571 --> 01:11:58.153]  What's your take on the situation with Russia and Ukraine?
[01:11:59.234 --> 01:12:08.679]  Also specifically about Nord Stream, because it seems like the Nord Stream pipeline destruction fits that pattern of infrastructure destruction that we are witnessing and suffering under in the United States.
[01:12:08.999 --> 01:12:14.061]   But in that case, Nord Stream Take the taking out of that pipeline really harmed Germany.
[01:12:14.761 --> 01:12:20.783]  It hurt Russia a little bit, but it really hurt Western Europe in terms of their industry shutdowns and their energy problems.
[01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:23.304]  What's your take on that whole situation?
[01:12:25.865 --> 01:12:30.467]  Well, I assessed 100% certainty that we sabotaged that.
[01:12:30.527 --> 01:12:32.647]  It's since come out through Seymour Hersh.
[01:12:32.988 --> 01:12:56.930]   I actually know some of the Special Warfare Navy hardhat divers that have placed all of that, but that fits perfectly with what's happening with the food processing, with what's happening in Palestine, all of that resource, and what they are trying to do is support the Global Cabal, the World Economic Forum, but also their Chinese masters as well.
[01:12:57.030 --> 01:13:02.600]   What's happening in Ukraine is that Putin and Russia, who are our allies, not our
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:07.630]   friends, but the enemy of our enemy, which is our own government, is our ally, is showing that
[01:13:07.630 --> 01:13:13.140]   third-generation kinetic warfare defeats fifth-generation information influence operations
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:15.130]  warfare, and that is about to collapse.
[01:13:15.130 --> 01:13:18.110]  So that's another huge inflection point.
[01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:24.211]   All that masquerade of us supporting Ukrainian Nazis is about to fall apart.
[01:13:24.211 --> 01:13:25.211]  And that's why China is not even a sign.
[01:13:25.211 --> 01:13:26.211]  So that's a really critical point.
[01:13:26.211 --> 01:13:26.711]  Bye.
[01:13:26.711 --> 01:13:29.411]  Yeah, critical point you just made there, Jeffrey.
[01:13:29.429 --> 01:13:39.397]  So you're saying that third-generation kinetic warfare, you're saying artillery beats BS press releases from the NATO countries, basically, right?
[01:13:39.678 --> 01:14:06.093]   So Russia's actually launching artillery while the West is launching press releases and just putting out propaganda that says Russia's losing and being destroyed and so on, but Russia's actually You know, they've got the industry, they've got the munitions, regardless of what people watching, whether you are pro-Russia or anti-Russia, you can't argue with the fact that Russia has more military industry and domestic industry than does the United States, or any European country at this point.
[01:14:06.153 --> 01:14:17.098]  So, I don't know, are the Western leaders like Victoria Nuland, are they so delusional that they think they can win this war with press releases and just fake news?
[01:14:17.338 --> 01:14:19.379]  I mean, what are they thinking, Jeffrey?
[01:14:21.781 --> 01:14:33.128]  Well, if you go back to the end of World War II, when the Office of Strategic Services goes away, CIA comes out, Special Forces comes out, and they decide that they have to destroy morals.
[01:14:33.768 --> 01:14:38.871]  And in Russia, it's the Orthodox Russian Church is Christianity, is the connection to God.
[01:14:38.931 --> 01:14:40.212]  So that has been targeted.
[01:14:40.272 --> 01:14:41.353]  That's why Russia.
[01:14:41.632 --> 01:14:48.632]   Communist China has never really been, there is a Christian church there, but it's never really been a real force.
[01:14:48.632 --> 01:14:56.132]   So the focus of that, for government to be God, for these now oligarchs in America, not Ukraine and Russia,
[01:14:56.132 --> 01:15:03.132]   oligarchs in America and the WEF to control everything, that's why they have to target and destroy Russia.
[01:15:03.132 --> 01:15:06.632]  And that's the obsession that they have with that.
[01:15:06.756 --> 01:15:12.624]  But it's not even the third generation war of World War Two, because they're doing standoff drone attacks.
[01:15:13.266 --> 01:15:16.787]  and they're basically grinding down Ukrainian forces.
[01:15:16.787 --> 01:15:22.266]   So the military-industrial complex is getting to supply more weaponry, and that's fine,
[01:15:22.266 --> 01:15:29.826]   but it's really also the biological intelligence complex of the 46 biolabs there that is being
[01:15:29.826 --> 01:15:30.826]  defeated there.
[01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:37.386]   So the defeat in Ukraine is a big wake-up call to WEF that this doesn't work.
[01:15:37.386 --> 01:15:43.666]   But unfortunately, no one is really aware of the sabotaging of the water and the land.
[01:15:43.666 --> 01:15:47.525]   They are aware of the food processing and chicken and egg kills in America, but not
[01:15:47.525 --> 01:15:51.845]  of the sabotaging of the land that's happening as well.
[01:15:51.845 --> 01:15:53.706]  But it all fits the same pattern.
[01:15:54.558 --> 01:16:02.444]  Okay, Jeffrey, I want to give out your website is JeffreyPrather.com and that's J-E-F-F-R-E-Y JeffreyPrather.com.
[01:16:03.204 --> 01:16:07.547]  Tell us about your site and your show and anything else you want to plug here as we wrap up segment with you.
[01:16:10.426 --> 01:16:31.293]  Well, I'm a retired SOCOM soldier, ex-DIA Defense Intelligence Agency intelligence officer, and I was a Drug Enforcement Administration Special Agent for 19 years until I blew the whistle that the DEA had to deal with a similar cartel to run drugs north in exchange for Fast and Furious guns going south.
[01:16:31.913 --> 01:16:38.938]  And since then, I've been trying to show the public what our government has turned against us.
[01:16:38.998 --> 01:16:56.870]  And it's sad to see that, but that's what I'm doing and supporting your efforts as well, your great efforts to get out the truth as America wakes up and we build the resistance legally, morally, ethically, and nonviolently against our corrupt government in our own country.
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:00.222]  Thank you, Jeffrey, for joining us.
[01:17:01.323 --> 01:17:06.408]  We're really glad to hear that you're out there analyzing all this and sharing this with all of us.
[01:17:06.808 --> 01:17:08.730]  JeffreyPrather.com is the website, folks.
[01:17:09.711 --> 01:17:10.011]  Visit it.
[01:17:10.031 --> 01:17:11.072]  You're going to learn a lot there.
[01:17:11.612 --> 01:17:17.338]  We continue here on the Alex Jones Show in the next segment with Eric Coppolino and other news coming up.
[01:17:17.458 --> 01:17:18.719]  Stay tuned.
[01:17:18.559 --> 01:17:37.719]  We'll be right back after this short break here on Infowars.com.
[01:17:37.719 --> 01:17:44.438]   For decades I have warned you over and over and over again that powerful multinational
[01:17:44.438 --> 01:17:49.918]   corporations are establishing a world government to cut off your resources, drive you into
[01:17:49.918 --> 01:17:53.359]  poverty and then dehumanize you and finally kill you.
[01:17:54.175 --> 01:17:57.618]  And we've been absolutely, totally vindicated in that fact.
[01:17:57.678 --> 01:18:00.261]  Now it's mainstream news and the world is awakening.
[01:18:01.002 --> 01:18:04.165]  But InfoWars wasn't just right about what was going to happen in the past.
[01:18:04.705 --> 01:18:10.491]  We're now breaking down what's going to happen in the future and now people are really listening and we can stop it together.
[01:18:11.872 --> 01:18:13.234]  So our information is paramount.
[01:18:13.274 --> 01:18:18.539]  We are literally creating the talking points and the opposition to the New World Order.
[01:18:19.631 --> 01:18:28.600]  It's not just myself that is getting the credit here, it's the listeners, the viewers, the guests, the callers, the brain trust that is InfoWars and everything we do.

[01:18:54.759 --> 01:18:55.339]  It's incredible.

[01:19:08.702 --> 01:19:14.462]   This stuff sells for 60, 70, 80% in stores, more than what we're selling it for.
[01:19:14.462 --> 01:19:18.021]   We've got it in 1000 milligram, 25 milligram, and 10 milligram,

[01:19:37.791 --> 01:19:40.033]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:40.093 --> 01:19:44.376]  I'm Mike Adams here, and we're going to be joined in a minute by Eric Coppolino.
[01:19:44.797 --> 01:19:52.082]  First, I want to bring your attention to something really important to share with you here, something that I've got even on my desk.
[01:19:52.363 --> 01:19:53.483]  Can you show the cameras here?
[01:19:54.324 --> 01:20:04.829]  The Satellite Phone Store is one of the sponsors of InfoWars, and if you go to InfoWarsPhone.com, you're going to see these products that I travel with that are absolutely critical.
[01:20:05.209 --> 01:20:37.766]   We've got the NMARSAT satellite phone there, we've got the IridiumSAT phone in the middle, and then the BivyStick, which is the small item, it's the size of kind of an ice cream sandwich there, and that gives you two-way satellite text messaging For when the power grid is down or the cell towers don't work and then this guy right here is a bandwidth device so it gives you actual satellite bandwidth you can use practically anywhere on the planet and it creates a Wi-Fi spot so you can have your laptop and phone join up with that connect to the Wi-Fi and have bandwidth.
[01:20:38.246 --> 01:20:42.129]  You can get all of this at InfoWarsPhone.com.
[01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:58.863]  And again, I do not travel without these because I don't trust the reliability of the power grid, nor the cell towers, and we've had all kinds of situations and storms and fires and hurricanes and, you know, whatever, freezing weather that shut down the power grid in Texas, you know, a year ago, a couple years ago.
[01:20:59.203 --> 01:21:05.288]  So, check this out, support the broadcast, get yourself some backup comms, and travel with this.
[01:21:05.788 --> 01:21:07.849]  So you can always keep in touch with your loved ones.
[01:21:07.889 --> 01:21:10.569]  Again, InfoWarsPhone.com.
[01:21:11.149 --> 01:21:15.230]  Now, we're going to be joined by Eric Coppolino here from PlanetWaves.fm.
[01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:18.471]  And Eric Coppolino is an expert in dioxins.
[01:21:18.551 --> 01:21:20.972]  He's been covering it for actual decades.
[01:21:21.612 --> 01:21:29.774]  And he joins us now to cover the latest developments in East Palestine in the train wreck chemical bomb, I guess, situation you could call it.
[01:21:30.594 --> 01:21:32.555]  Mr. Coppolino, thank you for joining me today.
[01:21:32.575 --> 01:21:33.875]  It's great to have you back on.
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:36.301]  Mike, thank you very much for having me.
[01:21:37.962 --> 01:21:39.003]  You're coming in loud and clear.
[01:21:39.023 --> 01:21:40.123]  That's awesome, Eric.
[01:21:40.484 --> 01:21:42.205]  So give us your latest assessment.
[01:21:42.225 --> 01:21:46.247]  We've had a lot happen since you and I talked, I guess, a week ago or so.
[01:21:46.708 --> 01:21:50.250]  What are the latest updates that you think are relevant for the audience to know?
[01:21:51.671 --> 01:21:58.055]  Well, there are now repeated calls for dioxin testing in the East Palestine area and the surroundings.
[01:21:58.095 --> 01:22:03.819]  But what I have been hearing talking to residents who are calling me is that people are sick.
[01:22:05.243 --> 01:22:12.730]  I spoke to one woman yesterday where she and her children were down with what they were describing as flu-like symptoms.
[01:22:13.251 --> 01:22:18.075]  Her brother a few miles away was also down with the same thing and both of his kids were down.
[01:22:18.096 --> 01:22:26.464]  And then she said that in a nearby school district, a quarter of the kids are out and they're calling it a stomach bug.
[01:22:27.501 --> 01:22:29.762]  So we're now starting to see the influence.
[01:22:30.182 --> 01:22:43.847]  I believe there was also a piece on Rents describing, I'm pretty sure that it was Rents, describing a wide diversity of illnesses associated with, you know, timed with this incident.
[01:22:44.688 --> 01:22:59.090]  People previously healthy and I've been talking to farms in Pennsylvania these kind of grass-fed and Amish type farms where they are worried because they've taken care of the land for years and now they are dealing with this pestilence.
[01:23:00.143 --> 01:23:03.406]  Yeah, we saw there was even a story in Breitbart kind of buried within the story.
[01:23:03.426 --> 01:23:08.650]  It said that people who had left East Palestine, they'd evacuated and then they felt better.
[01:23:08.670 --> 01:23:20.999]  The minute they came back to the town, they started to re-experience the same symptoms again, which would seemingly indicate that there are still toxins floating around or somehow people are still being exposed to these toxins.
[01:23:21.039 --> 01:23:34.412]   But you and I know, Eric, that these dioxins, which are created by the burning of chlorinated compounds such as vinyl chloride and PVC, These dioxins are toxic at insanely low concentrations.
[01:23:34.452 --> 01:23:39.919]  We're talking, you know, parts per quadrillion or femtograms or picograms.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:44.364]  I mean, it doesn't take much at all in order to make people sick.
[01:23:44.405 --> 01:23:46.387]  So maybe that's an explanation of what's going on.
[01:23:46.427 --> 01:23:46.848]  What do you think?
[01:23:48.061 --> 01:24:09.307]  Well, it doesn't take much dioxin to make people sick, but we have to also remember, I saw a photograph in the EPA complaint with an aerial photo of all the wrecked tanker cars, and with a little line pointing to each car saying what was in the car.
[01:24:10.067 --> 01:24:23.191]  And so there were probably 15 different substances released, including things that are not considered hazardous material, but certainly become hazardous in the middle of a situation like this.
[01:24:23.871 --> 01:24:26.192]  And there are synergistic effects of these chemicals.
[01:24:26.552 --> 01:24:37.516]  It's one thing to be exposed to one chemical, and it's another thing to be exposed to 10 chemicals, partially burned, and then blended together in the middle of this partial burn.
[01:24:37.556 --> 01:24:38.836]  It's absolute insanity.
[01:24:39.778 --> 01:24:41.059]  Yeah, that is a sound.
[01:24:41.099 --> 01:24:51.284]  I was able to get my hands on this book right here, The Dioxin War, Robert Allen, and this was a little bit difficult to find, but it says truth and lies about a perfect poison.
[01:24:51.884 --> 01:24:59.588]  And you know, Eric, that this is called the perfect poison because it's almost impossible to destroy once it's created.
[01:24:59.648 --> 01:25:04.270]  It's very difficult, you know, to dismantle this and it persists.
[01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:08.435]  For you know what, centuries or even possibly millennia.
[01:25:08.816 --> 01:25:11.400]  So tell us what you know about- Well, Carroll says billions of years.
[01:25:12.181 --> 01:25:12.741]  Billions of years?
[01:25:12.761 --> 01:25:13.462]  Billions of years.
[01:25:14.204 --> 01:25:14.384]  Yeah.
[01:25:14.424 --> 01:25:18.950]  Yeah, we're talking about it'll still be here when the sun turns into a red giant.
[01:25:19.989 --> 01:25:34.217]  So when they inject this underground, as they were already doing in Texas and now apparently in Indiana, because I guess the EPA has diverted some of this toxic firefighting water waste to Indiana, and they're injecting it in these deep wells.
[01:25:34.858 --> 01:25:36.138]  I mean, that doesn't make it go away.
[01:25:36.158 --> 01:25:40.081]  It just puts it underneath all our aquifers and underneath our farms.
[01:25:40.141 --> 01:25:42.342]  And, you know, things can move around, obviously.
[01:25:42.362 --> 01:25:44.203]  They do.
[01:25:44.243 --> 01:25:45.744]  There's no aquifer that's contained.
[01:25:46.936 --> 01:25:48.539]  This will contaminate the groundwater.
[01:25:48.579 --> 01:25:54.006]  That is equally insane as putting it in a pit and burning it.
[01:25:54.446 --> 01:25:59.333]  This stuff has got to be stored above the ground in contained tanks until they figure out what to do with it.
[01:25:59.433 --> 01:26:08.081]   I have never in my entire life Heard of disposing of dioxin waste or any chemical waste by injecting it into a well.
[01:26:08.521 --> 01:26:12.364]  This is the kind of thing that would result in an enforcement action if you did this.
[01:26:12.444 --> 01:26:17.248]  If you poured it down your toilet you would find yourself in handcuffs.
[01:26:18.342 --> 01:26:28.164]  Well, yeah, but I mean, just to be clear, they are claiming, and there's a company in Texas called Texas Molecular, and they are licensed to handle hazardous waste, apparently.
[01:26:28.204 --> 01:26:29.084]  I just learned about them.
[01:26:29.644 --> 01:26:34.425]  And apparently, they can handle vinyl chloride, or they can, you know, drop it down a deep hole.
[01:26:34.625 --> 01:26:40.126]  But they say, oh, it's so deep that this won't come to the surface of the Earth.
[01:26:40.246 --> 01:26:42.966]  It's so deep that it won't interact with the aquifers and so on.
[01:26:42.986 --> 01:26:43.747]  This is what they say.
[01:26:43.767 --> 01:26:45.987]  It's so deep, you can forget about it.
[01:26:47.007 --> 01:26:47.968]  I'm not sure I'm buying that.
[01:26:48.088 --> 01:26:48.568]  What do you think?
[01:26:49.209 --> 01:26:50.930]  I wouldn't buy it for a penny.
[01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:53.172]  It is absolutely rank insanity.
[01:26:53.532 --> 01:26:56.434]  This is not how dioxin waste is supposed to be disposed of.
[01:26:56.935 --> 01:27:01.818]  It's supposed to be put in an incinerator and burned to what's called six nines.
[01:27:01.838 --> 01:27:11.045]  99.9999% disposal with consumption by the incinerator, which is itself a lie because you can't ever get it that clean.
[01:27:11.745 --> 01:27:17.370]  Because of the cool-down phases and warm-up phases of the incineration process?
[01:27:17.991 --> 01:27:24.697]  But I have never in my entire life anywhere once read or heard of throwing it down a well.
[01:27:25.718 --> 01:27:27.799]  I'm absolutely astonished by this.
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:35.666]  Alright, I'm holding up a diagram of the molecule and maybe the control guys can actually find a better molecule there for dioxin.
[01:27:36.107 --> 01:27:36.487]  This is 2378-TCDD.
[01:27:38.922 --> 01:27:39.602]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:27:39.943 --> 01:27:48.647]  So, I can tell you though, the actual solution for sure, I know because we have this in our lab, we have a plasma torch on one of our mass spec instruments, well, a couple of them.
[01:27:49.168 --> 01:27:54.130]  Plasma torches will disintegrate these molecules, but they use a massive amount of electricity.
[01:27:54.831 --> 01:28:06.537]  So, no, seriously, you gotta run, you gotta take all this water, you nebulize it, you run it through a plasma torch, and you get nothing but carbon and hydrogen and chlorine atoms all kind of dismantled.
[01:28:06.577 --> 01:28:07.597]  That's the solution.
[01:28:07.818 --> 01:28:08.198]  Seriously.
[01:28:09.625 --> 01:28:11.985]  Well, that's a lot better than dumping it down a well.
[01:28:12.466 --> 01:28:14.286]  Yeah, but it was speechless.
[01:28:15.626 --> 01:28:18.767]  Well, but the thing is, of course, it would cost a fortune to do that.
[01:28:18.827 --> 01:28:20.227]  So this is the thing.
[01:28:20.747 --> 01:28:24.808]  They took vinyl chloride, which wasn't worth much, right?
[01:28:24.908 --> 01:28:26.788]  I mean, kind of dirt cheap as a bulk material.
[01:28:27.088 --> 01:28:30.349]  And PVC, you know, kind of dirt cheap as a bulk material.
[01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:45.573]   And then through what I'm calling asymmetrical chemical terrorism, They then created who knows how many tens of billions or hundreds of billions of dollars in damage to farms and people and homes and family and animals and rivers and crops and everything.
[01:28:45.593 --> 01:28:47.474]  I mean, you talk about asymmetrical warfare.
[01:28:47.734 --> 01:28:49.155]  What do you think about that, Eric?
[01:28:49.515 --> 01:28:51.895]  I mean, the damage is incalculable.
[01:28:52.996 --> 01:28:56.737]  Look, I mean, let's go back to some of the early history of dioxin.
[01:28:56.757 --> 01:29:00.858]  It was a component of a chemical weapon, Agent Orange.
[01:29:00.958 --> 01:29:08.928]   Most people know of dioxin From their parents and grandparents, dad and their grandfather who were exposed to it during the Vietnam War.
[01:29:09.828 --> 01:29:18.971]  And so it is a component of a chemical weapon that was used for years in Vietnam and then it was dumped on the Pacific Northwest in Oregon.
[01:29:19.871 --> 01:29:21.552]  So it is a warfare agent.
[01:29:23.530 --> 01:29:26.975]  Well, absolutely, and we're in a war, right?
[01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:28.517]  We are being attacked.
[01:29:28.557 --> 01:29:35.747]  Now, do you think that this... Even if the initial accident wasn't intentional, they intentionally set it on fire.
[01:29:35.927 --> 01:29:37.189]  They intentionally spread it.
[01:29:37.229 --> 01:29:39.452]  They intentionally injected it deep underground.
[01:29:39.733 --> 01:29:40.233]  Things like that.
[01:29:41.634 --> 01:29:42.475]  We've got to go to break, Eric.
[01:29:42.675 --> 01:29:47.357]  I'm sorry, but hold your answer to that question and we'll be right back after this break.
[01:29:47.817 --> 01:29:54.701]  We're going to continue with Eric Coppolino here from planetwaves.org if you want to see his Substack page, planetwaves.org.
[01:29:55.061 --> 01:29:58.843]  We'll be back with Eric Coppolino and much more straight ahead here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:59.283 --> 01:29:59.943]  I'm Mike Adams.
[01:29:59.983 --> 01:30:06.066]  We continue through the entire next hour, including with Attorney Brian Festa filing a lawsuit.
[01:30:06.306 --> 01:30:07.467]  We'll be right back after this break.
[01:30:08.624 --> 01:30:09.505]  All right, welcome back, folks.
[01:30:09.545 --> 01:30:18.072]  We're continuing here with Eric Coppolino for this hour and also going to be joined by Brian Fessa from We the Patriots USA at the bottom of this hour.
[01:30:18.593 --> 01:30:22.456]  Now, continuing with Mr. Coppolino, I've got a question for you, Eric.
[01:30:23.377 --> 01:30:29.002]  I had supposed that the EPA has already conducted dioxin tests secretly.
[01:30:30.363 --> 01:30:39.250]  I think, in my mind at least, there's no doubt they already have these tests and they're probably freaking out over it and figuring out, you know, trying to scheme, you know, how do we keep this from the public?
[01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:40.431]  What's your take?
[01:30:40.451 --> 01:30:42.953]  Do you think the EPA knows that dioxins are out there?
[01:30:44.014 --> 01:30:45.375]  I would bet a lot of money that you're right.
[01:30:45.415 --> 01:30:46.776]  I've been saying the same exact thing.
[01:30:46.796 --> 01:30:47.997]  We're on the same page on this.
[01:30:48.337 --> 01:30:49.799]  Of course they're testing for dioxin.
[01:30:50.699 --> 01:30:52.381]  How could they not be testing for dioxin?
[01:30:53.001 --> 01:31:06.772]   But the problem is that once that becomes public, once there's a single Dioxin test result that says that they've got this chemical in that situation, then the conversation goes to two things.
[01:31:07.332 --> 01:31:08.913]  One, it goes to evacuation.
[01:31:09.453 --> 01:31:13.394]  And then the second thing it does is it goes to how far did this spread?
[01:31:13.914 --> 01:31:15.515]  I want my area tested.
[01:31:16.055 --> 01:31:25.138]  And so they know that they are really opening up Pandora's box by even admitting that there's any dioxin.
[01:31:26.334 --> 01:31:30.017]  Yeah, but how long do you think they can keep this charade going?
[01:31:30.077 --> 01:31:37.122]  Because at some point you would think that even a lot of environmental groups are going to conduct testing.
[01:31:37.163 --> 01:31:39.184]  Maybe some universities are going to conduct testing.
[01:31:39.204 --> 01:31:42.927]  I mean, eventually we're going to have the dioxin testing equipment in place.
[01:31:42.967 --> 01:31:45.449]  It's a few months out, but we're going to be doing testing.
[01:31:45.489 --> 01:31:47.731]  I mean, they can't keep this up forever.
[01:31:48.271 --> 01:31:51.334]  So what do you think their plan is here?
[01:31:53.208 --> 01:31:54.809]  Well, I don't know.
[01:31:54.909 --> 01:31:59.393]  But look, I mean, they're trying to keep, you know, it's 100 pounds of poo in a 50 pound sack right now.
[01:32:00.133 --> 01:32:02.835]  And they are being asked about it every time they turn around.
[01:32:02.935 --> 01:32:09.680]  We've got the senators from Ohio demanding testing and the pressure is on them.
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:18.747]  And I think they know the extent of the problem they have the minute they admit that there's dioxin in this situation.
[01:32:19.087 --> 01:32:22.490]  And they've managed to keep it quiet for nearly a month.
[01:32:23.769 --> 01:32:27.774]  And you know they're going to try to downplay the results or they're going to try to confuse them.
[01:32:28.555 --> 01:32:42.731]  They have a whole playbook of things that they do from fake studies to losing test results and I can only imagine that it's really a crisis situation at the EPA right now.
[01:32:43.362 --> 01:32:54.146]  Well, just to be clear, I want our audience to know that the actual test here only takes, it's about a 24 minute run on a triple quad mass spec with a GC interface.
[01:32:54.767 --> 01:33:07.252]  So in 24 minutes, they can have, they can run water, or if you have to do sample prep for like a meat sample or a dairy sample or something, you know, give yourself another half hour for the sample prep.
[01:33:08.092 --> 01:33:10.214]  And so within an hour they could have results.
[01:33:10.255 --> 01:33:14.499]  So there is no excuse for the EPA to not have these results.
[01:33:14.859 --> 01:33:21.687]  In fact, it's got to be, Eric, that if they had the results and the results were zero, they would have already shared that publicly.
[01:33:21.727 --> 01:33:24.169]  They would have said, oh, we found no dioxin whatsoever.
[01:33:25.034 --> 01:33:25.494]  Exactly.
[01:33:26.014 --> 01:33:26.495]  Your thoughts?
[01:33:26.735 --> 01:33:28.996]  But the thing is, we don't need just dioxin.
[01:33:29.036 --> 01:33:50.444]   We need a full-spectrum dioxin and full-spectrum dibenzofuran, and then that results in one result called a TEQ, a toxic equivalency, or a 2378-TCDD equivalency, and that number is a kind of a weighted composite of all of the different dioxins and furans That were found in the situation.
[01:33:50.504 --> 01:33:52.324]  So it's not merely a yes or no.
[01:33:52.944 --> 01:33:56.185]  We want to know the distribution of these chemicals.
[01:33:56.225 --> 01:34:02.067]  In other words, how much 2, 3, 7, 8 of each and then how much of the other isomers and congeners.
[01:34:02.987 --> 01:34:05.568]  And it has to be done at the point source.
[01:34:06.248 --> 01:34:10.369]  And then it has to be done on rooftops all throughout East Palestine.
[01:34:10.930 --> 01:34:15.431]  And then we have to get our first fingerprint of the plume and how it spread.
[01:34:16.337 --> 01:34:19.452]  But the most important is what is actually in the burn pit.
[01:34:20.492 --> 01:34:20.852]  Exactly.
[01:34:20.892 --> 01:34:35.940]  Right, so we're talking about they're really going to have to take probably tens of thousands of samples across, you know, how many thousands of square miles ultimately in order to determine where the fallout took place and exactly what's there.
[01:34:36.461 --> 01:34:40.043]  So, you know, good thing the EPA has a multi-billion dollar budget, huh?
[01:34:40.223 --> 01:34:43.424]  Because they're going to need it to do all this testing.
[01:34:43.444 --> 01:34:44.505]  Well, it's a thousand dollars.
[01:34:44.585 --> 01:34:45.565]  It's not a cheap test.
[01:34:45.646 --> 01:34:49.968]   I mean, even when they do it in-house, the process is not Eric, we've got to cut the break.
[01:34:49.988 --> 01:34:50.829]  We'll be right back.
[01:34:50.909 --> 01:34:52.490]  Just stay with us one minute away.
[01:34:52.530 --> 01:34:53.991]  We'll be right back with Eric Coppolino.
[01:34:54.051 --> 01:34:55.852]  More about dioxin testing straight ahead.
[01:34:57.011 --> 01:34:57.771]  All right, we're back.
[01:34:57.831 --> 01:35:00.252]  Welcome to the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:00.372 --> 01:35:04.653]  I'm Mike Adams, joining you from the remote studio today.
[01:35:05.373 --> 01:35:11.254]  So thank you for all your support of InfoWarsStore.com, and don't forget about InfoWarsPhone.com as well.
[01:35:11.274 --> 01:35:17.516]  That's a great product lineup for backup remote communications, satellite comms when the cell towers go down.
[01:35:17.896 --> 01:35:24.918]  Now we're joined by Eric Coppolino from PlanetWaves.fm, and his Substack site can be reached at PlanetWaves.org.
[01:35:26.338 --> 01:35:28.360]  And Eric, I have a question for you here.
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:34.267]  Since we're going to be joined by an attorney at the bottom of this hour, Brian Festa, I want your take.
[01:35:34.487 --> 01:35:38.632]  I know you've worked with a lot of attorneys on toxins and environmental contamination.
[01:35:39.393 --> 01:35:42.075]  What's your take on the legal theories that can be invoked here?
[01:35:42.176 --> 01:35:46.439]   And do you think that there is a criminal element That might be invoked here.
[01:35:46.459 --> 01:35:49.001]  For example, a criminal cover-up on the part of the EPA.
[01:35:49.041 --> 01:35:52.002]  What if they know about this and they're withholding it from people?
[01:35:52.542 --> 01:35:55.884]  Or a criminal cover-up, perhaps, on the part of other parties involved.
[01:35:56.224 --> 01:35:57.164]  What's your take on it, Eric?
[01:35:57.964 --> 01:36:02.206]  Well, though it would be challenging, I think there is plenty of criminal exposure.
[01:36:02.726 --> 01:36:10.290]  But we could go first to toxic torts and what a cause of action might be.
[01:36:10.770 --> 01:36:23.182]   And the most interesting, and I think Potentially effective cause of action I've ever heard is to bring a battery case against people batteries another word for assault and assault
[01:36:24.039 --> 01:36:30.761]  Based on case law, it can be as little as an unwanted kiss or tapping a person's cane can be counted as battery.
[01:36:30.841 --> 01:36:41.025]  Battery is harmful or potentially offensive touching, and this is certainly harmful or potentially offensive touching, and I think a very strong case could be made for battery.
[01:36:41.545 --> 01:36:43.246]  Battery is an intentional tort.
[01:36:43.666 --> 01:36:53.269]  In other words, it is not necessarily an act of desire, but it means that the person who did it knew or should have known about the outcome that they would have had.
[01:36:54.069 --> 01:37:06.198]  And all of the environmental agencies have volumes and volumes of records talking about the creation of dioxins from vinyl chloride and from polyvinyl chloride.
[01:37:06.599 --> 01:37:10.001]  This is a known issue going back many, many decades.
[01:37:10.922 --> 01:37:16.166]  So are you saying then, I mean, who would potentially be responsible for the battery?
[01:37:16.446 --> 01:37:18.447]  The railroad company that set fire to it?
[01:37:18.547 --> 01:37:20.048]  Or the responders?
[01:37:20.369 --> 01:37:22.010]  Who exactly are you referring to?
[01:37:23.032 --> 01:37:26.974]  I would say that a proper complaint would go all the way up and down the line.
[01:37:26.994 --> 01:37:29.956]  It would include litigating the manufacturers.
[01:37:30.636 --> 01:37:33.778]  We still do not know who owned that vinyl chloride.
[01:37:34.078 --> 01:37:36.840]  We don't know who was the buyer of that vinyl chloride.
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:41.583]  I'm sure now that nobody wants to be known as the buyer of that vinyl chloride.
[01:37:42.023 --> 01:37:50.328]  But I've seen litigation that basically sues every single potentially responsible party, as they're called in EPA language, a PRP.
[01:37:51.457 --> 01:38:01.744]  In all fairness, though, Eric, I mean, the company that makes the vinyl chloride or the company that purchased it, I don't see how it could be their fault.
[01:38:01.764 --> 01:38:05.206]  I mean, didn't they hand it over to the railroad for safe transportation?
[01:38:05.246 --> 01:38:06.167]  That's the railroad's job.
[01:38:06.567 --> 01:38:09.389]  You know, transport this from A to B. Don't spill it.
[01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:10.490]  Don't lose it.
[01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:11.130]  Right?
[01:38:11.771 --> 01:38:16.134]  And that, you know, the manufacturer, they didn't say, you know, tip it over and set it on fire.
[01:38:16.454 --> 01:38:16.634]  Right?
[01:38:19.015 --> 01:38:20.816]  No, they didn't.
[01:38:20.936 --> 01:38:23.196]  But we need to have discovery with these people.
[01:38:23.276 --> 01:38:28.658]  We need to know exactly who they are and what they knew, and we need to know their accountability.
[01:38:28.738 --> 01:38:31.438]  We need to know the terms of the shipping.
[01:38:31.898 --> 01:38:44.061]  So I'm only basing this on experience from lawsuits that I've seen, where even the people who manufacture the components of the vinyl chloride could be on the liability chain.
[01:38:44.321 --> 01:38:47.502]  Everyone has to be held accountable, every last person involved, Mike.
[01:38:47.898 --> 01:38:59.207]  Well, I do see a point where if, for example, if the owner of this material did not, for example, have proper filing of the hazardous status with the railroad, right?
[01:38:59.928 --> 01:39:07.874]  So potentially maybe the railroad didn't know that that's exactly, or maybe perhaps it wasn't labeled correctly, or perhaps hazardous handling information.
[01:39:08.394 --> 01:39:09.936]  But I get your point.
[01:39:10.076 --> 01:39:12.498]  We've got to go up and down the chain and dig into this.
[01:39:13.058 --> 01:39:17.659]  Probably attorneys will do this and find out, was it documented correctly?
[01:39:17.699 --> 01:39:18.960]  Was it safely handled correctly?
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:24.001]  Did the people at the railroad understand how to handle this in case of an accident?
[01:39:24.281 --> 01:39:26.722]  Did they receive proper training or did they ignore their training?
[01:39:27.002 --> 01:39:28.402]  Because somebody screwed up big time.
[01:39:28.802 --> 01:39:29.182]  Somebody.
[01:39:29.663 --> 01:39:34.444]  And we're talking, I think, maybe tens of billions of dollars in damage here.
[01:39:35.459 --> 01:39:36.561]  Oh, I mean, by far.
[01:39:36.641 --> 01:39:44.134]  I mean, a relatively minor spill on a college campus in New York cost more than $50 million to clean up in the 1990s.
[01:39:45.855 --> 01:39:59.740]  A single building in Binghamton, New York, called the Binghamton State Office Building, cost $50 million in 1980s dollars to clean, quote-unquote, clean one building, and they didn't even get all the dioxin and PCBs out of that building.
[01:40:00.141 --> 01:40:08.884]  There's ultimately no remediating this, but from a liability standpoint, the thing we want now is we want discovery.
[01:40:09.631 --> 01:40:13.554]  We need to see, they all need to purge their files.
[01:40:13.614 --> 01:40:17.197]  We need to know exactly what is in their files.
[01:40:17.237 --> 01:40:19.919]  We need the emails, we need everything.
[01:40:20.079 --> 01:40:28.945]  That's how documents like this that I put on the program last week, we were on a different platform, come out in the wash.
[01:40:29.065 --> 01:40:36.845]   And this document gives the internal history of dioxin known by Monsanto up
[01:40:36.845 --> 01:40:42.145]   until 1956 where they admit they've got a dioxin problem in all of their chlorinated
[01:40:42.145 --> 01:40:43.664]  phenol products.
[01:40:43.664 --> 01:40:47.945]   But when they were dumping it on people in Vietnam and on American troops in Vietnam
[01:40:47.945 --> 01:40:52.905]   and then dumping it on the forests in the Pacific Northwest, they were denying that
[01:40:52.905 --> 01:40:58.945]   they had any early knowledge of the contamination by dioxin until this document came out and
[01:40:58.945 --> 01:41:01.945]  prove it.
[01:41:00.041 --> 01:41:01.441]  This is the kind of thing we need.
[01:41:02.170 --> 01:41:03.171]  Thank you for getting me that document.
[01:41:03.191 --> 01:41:05.033]  Let me just summarize one of the key findings here.
[01:41:05.113 --> 01:41:08.377]  So there are, I think, four companies mentioned in this document.
[01:41:08.477 --> 01:41:12.141]  It's Bayer, Dow, Monsanto and BASF.
[01:41:12.861 --> 01:41:19.148]  And by the way, two of those four companies were part of IG Farben, which was found guilty of Nazi war crimes against humanity.
[01:41:19.969 --> 01:41:26.469]   My understanding is in the late 1940s and the early 1950s, they had an accident, an industrial accident,
[01:41:26.469 --> 01:41:31.668]   that accidentally created these dioxins, killed or I should say injured a lot of people,
[01:41:31.668 --> 01:41:36.807]   and then in one of these accident rooms, they cleaned it out, they cleared it out,
[01:41:36.807 --> 01:41:41.109]   washed it out, waited 10 days, and then they put rabbits in cages
[01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:45.708]   and just left the rabbits in the room for one day, and all those rabbits died.
[01:41:45.708 --> 01:41:47.648]  And this is 10 days later, okay?
[01:41:47.648 --> 01:41:50.868]  So we're talking about, yes, go ahead.
[01:41:50.868 --> 01:41:54.868]   Even worse, they removed the cages, they put new rabbits in the cages,
[01:41:54.868 --> 01:42:00.708]   and they died outside of that building where the accident happened.
[01:42:01.627 --> 01:42:06.251]  See, to me, this reminds me of the fact that people are coming back to East Palestine and they're getting sick again.
[01:42:06.891 --> 01:42:13.937]  Because there's something about dioxins that lingers forever, potentially, but extremely low concentrations.
[01:42:14.217 --> 01:42:24.185]  Those rabbits kept dying and dying and they found out that the toxic dose on a rabbit is so small, I think it ended up being five parts per billion of some small amount put on a rabbit.
[01:42:24.525 --> 01:42:25.106]  Killed a rabbit.
[01:42:25.706 --> 01:42:26.107]  Every time.
[01:42:27.521 --> 01:42:31.642]  Well, we need to be asking people about their pets, their bunny rabbits and their guinea pigs.
[01:42:32.202 --> 01:42:37.144]  Guinea pigs are even more sensitive to dioxin contamination, and they will be the first to die.
[01:42:38.324 --> 01:42:38.864]  Right, right.
[01:42:38.985 --> 01:42:49.188]  And we've already seen stories documenting what, 43,000 animals have died in the area, mostly a lot of fish is what they're counting, but surely there are millions more that they haven't counted.
[01:42:49.228 --> 01:42:51.608]  I mean, is anybody standing there in the creek counting fish?
[01:42:51.888 --> 01:42:52.609]  You know, give me a break.
[01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:54.569]  Or is that an EPA job?
[01:42:57.836 --> 01:43:10.746]  People are going to be harmed for, you know, the other thing that came out of this is that some people didn't develop chloracne, which is, you know, their face all exploding in postules because of the dioxin exposure, getting infections and everything all in their face.
[01:43:11.246 --> 01:43:15.889]  It didn't show up for 10 to 12 months later, after the exposure, right?
[01:43:16.970 --> 01:43:21.373]  Well, yeah, and that's because chloracne is evidence of systemic poisoning.
[01:43:21.814 --> 01:43:24.436]  The skin, as you know, is an excretion gland, right?
[01:43:24.896 --> 01:43:26.117]  Perspiration is excretion.
[01:43:26.804 --> 01:43:27.004]  Right?
[01:43:27.664 --> 01:43:36.627]  And so the dioxin is going to work its way through the body and the body will use every means it can possibly use to get rid of the stuff.
[01:43:36.747 --> 01:43:41.249]  And so the chloracne is evidence of systemic poisoning.
[01:43:41.269 --> 01:43:43.109]  And they knew this in the 1930s.
[01:43:43.770 --> 01:43:52.240]   They knew this with something called the Drinker Study conducted by a Harvard professor for a company called Swan Chemical that
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:54.190]  eventually became Monsanto in the 1930s.
[01:43:54.190 --> 01:43:58.911]   And they taught, I'm sure you read that part in this document where they say,
[01:43:58.911 --> 01:44:03.150]   "Oh, now we understand what was making the people sick in previous decades."
[01:44:03.150 --> 01:44:07.951]   Yeah, so the whole thing is how can we commercialize that and turn it into a chemical
[01:44:07.951 --> 01:44:10.030]  weapon and make a lot of money off of it, right?
[01:44:10.269 --> 01:44:15.770]  Instead of saying, oh, this is the most dangerous chemical in the world, we should shut this down, they said, oh, how do we make money off this?
[01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:17.070]  Right?
[01:44:17.211 --> 01:44:18.951]  I mean, essentially, that's... And they made plenty.
[01:44:19.711 --> 01:44:23.492]  They did, yeah, and that became Agent Orange and other toxins.
[01:44:24.152 --> 01:44:26.193]  So, okay, stay with us, Eric.
[01:44:27.611 --> 01:44:28.251]  No, stay with us, Eric.
[01:44:28.272 --> 01:44:29.052]  We're going to go to break here.
[01:44:29.152 --> 01:44:30.573]  We'll be right back after this break, folks.
[01:44:30.713 --> 01:44:32.234]  More with Eric Coppolino.
[01:44:32.815 --> 01:44:37.818]  And we're going to talk about faked lab testing, potentially by the EPA, when we return.
[01:44:37.858 --> 01:44:40.280]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:41.401]  We'll be right back after this break.
[01:44:43.257 --> 01:44:45.118]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:44:45.138 --> 01:44:50.820]  I'm Mike Adams here giving you a look at our new studios, our Brighteon Studios I'm broadcasting from today.
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:45:02.083]  And I'll tell you what, building out this studio has given me so much appreciation for the InfoWars studios, which the people there running InfoWars are truly amazing.
[01:45:02.103 --> 01:45:03.764]  They have mastered this art.
[01:45:04.164 --> 01:45:07.645]  They are light years ahead of what we're pulling off here.
[01:45:07.664 --> 01:45:13.265]   We're just covering the basics, but thumbs up to all the InfoWars guys and gals there who are making it work.
[01:45:13.265 --> 01:45:17.864]   You guys and gals are awesome, and thank you for having me on today, Alex.
[01:45:17.864 --> 01:45:20.264]  So, okay, we're continuing with Eric Coppolino.
[01:45:20.264 --> 01:45:28.314]   Now, I want to shift gears just slightly, Eric, and I want to tell you that I believe the EPA also knows how to fake a
[01:45:28.314 --> 01:45:33.515]   lot of the testing, and I believe that this is happening across law enforcement
[01:45:33.515 --> 01:45:35.265]  labs across America.
[01:45:35.779 --> 01:45:38.361]  Let me just set this up, and I'll let you respond to this, Eric.
[01:45:39.802 --> 01:45:40.682]  I'm sorry to throw you a curveball.
[01:45:40.702 --> 01:45:42.864]  I don't know where you stand on this, but here's the thing.
[01:45:43.885 --> 01:45:47.087]  You know, I'm pro-law enforcement because I don't want criminals running loose in the cities.
[01:45:47.447 --> 01:45:57.053]  But I also know, because I run an ISO-accredited lab and I talk to lab people, I know labs have been shut down for faking lab results all the time for law enforcement.
[01:45:57.614 --> 01:46:01.797]  You know, a cop hands them, here's a bag of a white powdery substance and what is it?
[01:46:02.337 --> 01:46:04.078]  And they will fake like it's cocaine.
[01:46:04.418 --> 01:46:05.579]  They won't even run the test.
[01:46:05.819 --> 01:46:08.941]  And there are innocent people convicted all across this country.
[01:46:09.121 --> 01:46:11.363]  And there are innocent people on death row, believe me.
[01:46:11.943 --> 01:46:18.465]  Who have been convicted by faked law enforcement lab results from labs that are just making it all up.
[01:46:18.885 --> 01:46:21.366]  Literally making it up, not even doing the science.
[01:46:21.426 --> 01:46:24.286]  And I think the EPA right now is involved in a cover-up.
[01:46:24.646 --> 01:46:30.428]  But what are your thoughts, Eric, about lab testing and law enforcement, if you don't mind me asking about that topic?
[01:46:31.607 --> 01:46:31.747]  Yep.
[01:46:32.308 --> 01:46:35.532]  So first, there have been one lab scandal after the next.
[01:46:36.393 --> 01:46:49.990]  In terms of chemical companies, the most famous was Industrial Biotest Labs, which was busted by the FDA in the late 1970s for putting out thousands of falsified tests on chemical products.
[01:46:50.868 --> 01:46:54.969]  Including a lot of pesticides and food additives and deodorants and things like that.
[01:46:55.489 --> 01:47:03.871]  And most of those chemicals which were approved by the FDA and the EPA with phony tests are still on the market.
[01:47:04.431 --> 01:47:10.453]  But second, I've spent approximately the last like 1067 days on the COVID story.
[01:47:11.113 --> 01:47:16.094]  And at the very center of the COVID story is a molecular test called the polymerase chain reaction.
[01:47:17.455 --> 01:47:21.877]  And what the whole COVID story boils down to is testing fraud.
[01:47:22.397 --> 01:47:26.818]  They have no original of SARS-CoV-2 to prime the test with.
[01:47:27.318 --> 01:47:31.800]  You know, if you're testing for wine components, you have wine components to prime the test.
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:37.282]  And at the end of this, I, you know, I'm not quite at the end, but it's been a while.
[01:47:37.942 --> 01:47:49.006]   It has occurred to me many times through the process of doing this story That there is very likely to be a problem with DNA testing out of these criminal cases.
[01:47:50.007 --> 01:47:51.827]  This is a critical point.
[01:47:52.328 --> 01:47:57.230]  The PCR testing fraud, a lot of people are aware of how fraudulent that was when it came to COVID, right?
[01:47:57.270 --> 01:48:04.993]  So they do a swab, they stick it in a machine, and then they crank up the cycle thresholds to insane levels until they get, quote, a signal.
[01:48:05.553 --> 01:48:13.037]   The problem is, and I know this as a lab tech, you know, a published lab scientist, Their signal-to-noise ratio doesn't compute.
[01:48:13.197 --> 01:48:14.017]  It's all noise.
[01:48:14.397 --> 01:48:18.399]  So you can get any kind of a signal if you just crank up the noise high enough, right?
[01:48:18.439 --> 01:48:23.721]  You can find a peak, quote, you know, a peak if you just crank up the noise, which is what they're doing with PCR.
[01:48:24.062 --> 01:48:42.995]   So the question is, when they say, oh, this guy, his DNA was found at the scene of this murder, And it's a 99.99999% match, and I'm thinking, well wait a second, you did that with PCR, so you just cranked that up until you found a guilty signal in the noise, basically, is what's going on.
[01:48:43.295 --> 01:48:47.779]  But a lot of people don't even, they don't have the knowledge to be able to fight back against that.
[01:48:47.819 --> 01:48:51.202]  Even attorneys don't have necessarily the knowledge to say, wait a minute, that's bogus.
[01:48:51.562 --> 01:48:55.445]  You can't identify that person's DNA by just cranking up the PCR test.
[01:48:55.466 --> 01:48:56.606]  But they do it all the time.
[01:48:56.626 --> 01:48:56.947]  Go ahead.
[01:48:58.041 --> 01:49:03.182]  Yeah, and the problem with the COVID PCR was they never had a crime scene sample.
[01:49:03.763 --> 01:49:05.723]  They made up their crime scene sample.
[01:49:06.623 --> 01:49:20.147]  This is just like average perpetrator sample and then they take the, then they run the accused person's DNA and they create a match, but they never even had an original to work from.
[01:49:20.831 --> 01:49:26.856]  And so the testing scandals take every possible shape, size, and color.
[01:49:27.297 --> 01:49:29.278]  I've seen many, many, many of them.
[01:49:29.679 --> 01:49:32.581]  And I think that all of these DNA cases have to be rerun.
[01:49:33.021 --> 01:49:35.924]  We need to be checking on the integrity of the original samples.
[01:49:36.423 --> 01:49:41.663]   We need to be checking the cycle threshold because the PCR is used in all of this molecular
[01:49:41.663 --> 01:49:43.182]  and genetic testing.
[01:49:43.182 --> 01:49:46.543]  And we've got to figure out what's going on inside the box.
[01:49:46.543 --> 01:49:53.643]   You know, people just accept that there's just this like miracle truth machine, you know, DNA testing,
[01:49:53.643 --> 01:49:56.443]  but it's not, there's not any miracle truth machine.
[01:49:56.443 --> 01:50:01.103]   No, I'm so glad you said it that way because even in the courtrooms,
[01:50:01.103 --> 01:50:03.344]  they refer to quote, the science.
[01:50:03.431 --> 01:50:04.752]  Oh, it's the science.
[01:50:04.812 --> 01:50:05.813]  It has to be truthful.
[01:50:05.873 --> 01:50:11.177]  And the scientist is speaking in language that nobody else can decode, so therefore, it must be truth.
[01:50:11.517 --> 01:50:12.058]  No, it's not.
[01:50:12.658 --> 01:50:14.040]  It's a lot of hokum.
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:19.964]  Just hogwash and, you know, protein fraud, basically, is what we're talking about here.
[01:50:20.105 --> 01:50:20.645]  Protein fraud?
[01:50:20.685 --> 01:50:22.386]  Yeah, it's protein fraud.
[01:50:22.567 --> 01:50:23.587]  Oh, we found these proteins.
[01:50:23.728 --> 01:50:24.388]  Okay, whatever.
[01:50:25.609 --> 01:50:28.770]  You're creating all kinds of protein strands.
[01:50:29.130 --> 01:50:31.951]  You don't even know what you're replicating in your PCR machine.
[01:50:31.971 --> 01:50:33.171]  No, they have no idea what they're replicating.
[01:50:33.191 --> 01:50:33.851]  Background noise.
[01:50:34.451 --> 01:50:34.651]  Right.
[01:50:34.911 --> 01:50:36.672]  And then, oh, you found a match of this sequence.
[01:50:36.752 --> 01:50:37.832]  Well, so what?
[01:50:38.232 --> 01:50:40.373]  I mean, you didn't find a little person in there, did you?
[01:50:40.473 --> 01:50:41.813]  You didn't find a little tiny person.
[01:50:41.833 --> 01:50:45.634]  I mean, what did you find of this sequence that you say is a match?
[01:50:45.654 --> 01:50:46.094]  No, it's ridiculous.
[01:50:47.153 --> 01:50:47.593]  It's ridiculous.
[01:50:47.613 --> 01:50:47.954]  It is ridiculous.
[01:50:47.974 --> 01:50:50.956]  But with the chemical companies, I mean, it was completely insane.
[01:50:50.976 --> 01:50:52.677]  I mean, look this up.
[01:50:52.717 --> 01:50:57.360]  I mean, if you search industrial biotest labs in my name, it'll come up.
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:08.648]  And I will push, actually, at the top of Planet Waves FM, there's an interview with a guy named Peter von Stackelberg, who broke this story in the early 1980s single-handedly.
[01:51:08.768 --> 01:51:11.730]  And I'm honored to know this person and count him as a friend.
[01:51:12.311 --> 01:51:27.665]   And it is absolutely astounding the extent of the laboratory fraud And IVT Labs was only one of many, many labs that were busted, and three of its executives were convicted of federal mail-in wire fraud for this.
[01:51:28.735 --> 01:51:30.876]  Well, let me add something else here that's highly relevant.
[01:51:31.456 --> 01:51:33.736]  I call it the not detected fraud.
[01:51:34.096 --> 01:51:40.738]  Because any lab can, if they wish, if they are so motivated, they can tune their machines to not detect something.
[01:51:40.798 --> 01:51:43.739]  You can always decrease the sensitivity of your instruments.
[01:51:43.999 --> 01:51:45.779]  The hard part is increasing sensitivity.
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:49.361]   And we spend all kinds of time Increasing sensitivity.
[01:51:49.381 --> 01:51:58.468]  You know, you have to have the nebulizer, the flow rates have to be correct, the access has to be correct, you know, all the plumbing has to work correctly to get the sensitivity.
[01:51:58.708 --> 01:52:08.175]  So if the EPA is taking dioxin samples, and if they put out a report, I'm just going to say this ahead of time, if the EPA puts out a report and says not detected, that's nonsense.
[01:52:08.515 --> 01:52:13.219]  Because there's so much dioxin out there right now, they should always detect it, even without the train crash.
[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:14.240]  Correct?
[01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:15.862]  This is part of their problem right now.
[01:52:16.222 --> 01:52:17.384]  This is part of their problem.
[01:52:17.824 --> 01:52:25.513]  People are well enough informed now that they can't just come out and say, whoa, we're good, non-detect, we didn't find any, it's all good, ring the bell, everyone go home.
[01:52:25.774 --> 01:52:26.575]  They can't do that.
[01:52:26.955 --> 01:52:28.337]  Too many people are paying attention.
[01:52:28.717 --> 01:52:33.443]  This will cause a firestorm, another firestorm, if they do this.
[01:52:34.386 --> 01:52:34.947]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:52:34.967 --> 01:52:37.369]  I mean, EPA, we're putting you on notice right here.
[01:52:37.389 --> 01:52:38.409]  Putting you on notice.
[01:52:38.429 --> 01:52:42.373]  Alex Jones Show, Mike Adams, Health Ranger, Eric Coppolino, we're putting you on notice.
[01:52:43.033 --> 01:52:44.735]  If you lie, you're going to get caught.
[01:52:45.315 --> 01:52:45.856]  You're going to get caught.
[01:52:46.216 --> 01:52:47.697]  If you cover this up, you're going to get caught.
[01:52:47.737 --> 01:52:50.900]  And eventually, we're going to test for dioxin, even if you don't do it.
[01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:52.741]  And the truth is going to come out.
[01:52:52.861 --> 01:52:58.386]  So all you can do, EPA, you can run and hide and cover, but you can't stop the truth from coming out.
[01:52:58.526 --> 01:52:58.786]  OK?
[01:52:59.727 --> 01:53:01.569]  Final thoughts here, Eric, before we go to break.
[01:53:02.731 --> 01:53:04.952]  Yeah, they're not going to be able to hide this for long.
[01:53:05.472 --> 01:53:06.973]  They're just not going to be able to do it.
[01:53:07.013 --> 01:53:08.133]  People are too savvy now.
[01:53:08.193 --> 01:53:10.094]  They know the issue is out.
[01:53:10.134 --> 01:53:14.396]  Their best defense was keep it secret, but it's out.
[01:53:14.416 --> 01:53:14.676]  All right.
[01:53:15.356 --> 01:53:16.097]  Stand by, Eric.
[01:53:16.117 --> 01:53:21.879]  I'm going to see if we can bring you in on the next segment with Brian Festa, but we'll be right back after this break here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:21.939 --> 01:53:22.559]  I'm Mike Adams.
[01:53:22.959 --> 01:53:23.400]  Stay with us.
[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:24.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:53:25.046 --> 01:53:26.047]  All right, folks, welcome back.
[01:53:26.247 --> 01:53:32.430]  This is Mike Adams here, Alex Jones Show at Infowars.com and ConspiracyFact.info.
[01:53:33.110 --> 01:53:49.739]  And we're going to be joined now in this segment, well, the next two segments, by Brian Festa with We the Patriots USA and also Eric Coppolino, who we've been speaking with here about dioxins and the EPA and the PCR cover-up and many other topics.
[01:53:50.427 --> 01:53:57.133]  So we're going to actually bring in Brian Festa here because his group has filed a lawsuit or is in the process.
[01:53:57.613 --> 01:53:58.474]  He'll give us the information.
[01:53:59.254 --> 01:54:00.916]  Mr. Festa, thank you for joining me today.
[01:54:00.936 --> 01:54:12.245]  Can you give us a brief, please, about exactly what you're filing, what are the allegations of this lawsuit, and how many people have been harmed in your view by the events that have taken place?
[01:54:12.285 --> 01:54:12.666]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:15.741]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:54:15.841 --> 01:54:16.862]  Thank you for having me on.
[01:54:16.923 --> 01:54:20.686]  Yeah, we filed a lawsuit actually just yesterday in federal courts.
[01:54:20.706 --> 01:54:23.689]  This is the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.
[01:54:24.150 --> 01:54:25.291]  We filed that just yesterday.
[01:54:25.311 --> 01:54:27.674]  We had a press conference in Akron to announce that.
[01:54:28.902 --> 01:54:50.731]   But yes, this is a lawsuit against the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, as well as the Ohio EPA and the Governor of Ohio, as well as EPA and local public health officials who did not take The proper steps in our view to protect the public health.
[01:54:51.271 --> 01:54:54.232]  There was a lot that wasn't done that should have been done.
[01:54:54.252 --> 01:55:00.193]  I know you've been all over this, Mike, talking about asking people to send, you know, samples and testing.
[01:55:00.913 --> 01:55:06.174]  And that's absolutely the right thing to do because people are being harmed.
[01:55:06.254 --> 01:55:21.881]   We have expert witnesses that we intend to bring forward that have years of experience in environmental Testing environmental safety that are going to be able to testify specifically to what the federal government did wrong here.
[01:55:21.901 --> 01:55:28.605]  The federal government has an affirmative duty under the 14th Amendment.
[01:55:29.545 --> 01:55:31.446]  This is a substantive due process claim.
[01:55:31.466 --> 01:55:42.153]  So without getting too technical, the federal government cannot in any way take away or harm or do harm to someone's life, liberty or property without due process of law.
[01:55:42.993 --> 01:56:06.799]  And here, by not giving truthful information about these toxins and toxicants that were actually released into the environment, this chemical plume that was released, by not providing accurate data and not doing accurate testing, may have placed the public in harm's way, their life and their property in harm's way, and we intend to hold them accountable.
[01:56:07.478 --> 01:56:13.120]  Okay, Mr. Festa, I want to get Eric's response to that in a second, but what about the railroad?
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:20.323]  Does your lawsuit name Norfolk Southern, or is that not part of this lawsuit, or is that a separate action, or what's your take?
[01:56:21.698 --> 01:56:23.660]  Yes, so that is not part of this lawsuit.
[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:28.383]  There are other organizations and individuals that have already brought suit against Norfolk Southern.
[01:56:28.984 --> 01:56:32.126]  And in fact, that was one criticism we had when we first announced the lawsuit.
[01:56:32.166 --> 01:56:35.049]  Some people were saying, well, you know, isn't it the railroad's fault?
[01:56:35.089 --> 01:56:37.531]  Why are you, you know, going after the government in this?
[01:56:37.831 --> 01:56:39.012]  Shouldn't you be suing the railroad?
[01:56:39.392 --> 01:56:46.998]  Well, in the mass tort action that we do believe is coming, and we are certain is coming, absolutely, Norfolk Southern will be named.
[01:56:47.299 --> 01:56:48.900]  This is not a mass tort action, though.
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:57:00.150]   This is trying to protect The life and the health of the individuals living in East Palestine and the immediate surrounding area now, because there are people that are still in harm's way.
[01:57:00.171 --> 01:57:14.579]  They're being told, because by and large, and I don't know why, but after what we've seen the last three years, but by and large, the general public still relies on the federal government and their state government officials to give them accurate information.
[01:57:14.639 --> 01:57:15.399]  They're the only ones.
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:17.761]  Norfolk Southern can't order an evacuation.
[01:57:19.032 --> 01:57:21.073]  They can't do the proper testing.
[01:57:21.994 --> 01:57:22.974]  You make a critical point there.
[01:57:23.014 --> 01:57:24.115]  So now I want to bring in Eric.
[01:57:24.175 --> 01:57:31.439]  Now, I don't know if you two have ever met, but Eric Coppolino has a lot of experience working with litigators on this subject for many decades.
[01:57:31.459 --> 01:57:37.502]  So Eric, give us your take on what Brian Fessler just said and the lawsuit from what you know about so far.
[01:57:38.422 --> 01:57:39.483]  Brian, first a question.
[01:57:39.523 --> 01:57:45.166]  I'm asking if you have filed for injunctive relief demanding dioxin testing and furan testing.
[01:57:49.278 --> 01:58:15.708]  We have filed for injunctive relief, so what we're asking for in our lawsuit is a declaratory judgment, finding that they've engaged in conduct that is what's known as a state-created danger to the plaintiffs and all similarly situated residents of that area, and also a writ of mandamus ordering the defendants to conduct an industry-standard occupational contaminant testing, which would include, I believe, I'm not a scientist and I'll leave that to our expert witnesses, but that would include the testing that you just mentioned.
[01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:22.160]  Okay, I mean, that's very important because they're going to test for the wrong thing in the wrong place.
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:27.451]  I mean, that's the MO of the EPA, is to, you know, test the air for vinyl chloride and say that it's safe.
[01:58:28.194 --> 01:58:33.118]  And so these are not ordinary, you know, these are not ordinary chemicals we need to be looking for here.
[01:58:33.158 --> 01:58:38.782]  And let me add too, Brian, relay this message because, you know, I'm a lab scientist.
[01:58:38.802 --> 01:58:40.863]  We specialize in food contamination.
[01:58:41.444 --> 01:58:49.270]  I own six mass spec instruments and we're adding dioxin testing interface, a GC interface, to one of our triple quad mass spec instruments.
[01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:53.373]  But watch out for them saying not detected.
[01:58:53.994 --> 01:58:58.618]  If they test samples for dioxin and they say not detected, that's a fraud.
[01:58:58.919 --> 01:59:06.646]  It means that they're probably tuning their instruments so that it doesn't have the limit of detection, as it's called, or LOD, that is able to see those chemicals.
[01:59:06.906 --> 01:59:14.952]   Because these chemicals are in all the You know, the dairy products and meat right now, at some tiny, tiny level, it is detectable.
[01:59:15.272 --> 01:59:16.793]  If they say not detected, they're lying.
[01:59:16.953 --> 01:59:18.514]  I just want to get that on the record.
[01:59:18.674 --> 01:59:23.277]  And Eric and I have talked about that, but go ahead, Brian, your thoughts on what's next.
[01:59:25.017 --> 01:59:27.158]  Well, I absolutely agree with you.
[01:59:27.198 --> 01:59:30.439]  The testing they've done is woefully inadequate and inaccurate.
[01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:38.983]  Because Kristen Megyn Kelly, who's one of the experts, she actually hosts a podcast for us called Vets and Visionaries here at We the Patriots USA.
[01:59:39.243 --> 01:59:41.424]  She's an industrial hygienist with years of experience.
[01:59:41.444 --> 01:59:46.984]   She's government trained, worked while she was in the Air Force for many years, and she
[01:59:46.984 --> 01:59:53.724]   has talked at length about these exact compounds that you're mentioning now and why the testing
[01:59:53.724 --> 01:59:55.363]  they're doing is not accurate.
[01:59:55.363 --> 01:59:59.364]   For instance, just doing spot testing rather than testing over an eight-hour period.
[01:59:59.364 --> 02:00:04.803]   For instance, just testing a foot above the ground level for air quality instead of five
[02:00:04.803 --> 02:00:06.803]  feet, six feet where most people are breathing.
[02:00:07.204 --> 02:00:10.187]  Just testing at the surface of the water rather than going down into the sludge.
[02:00:10.227 --> 02:00:12.109]  I mean, I could go on and on and on and on about it.
[02:00:12.169 --> 02:00:14.051]  I'm not even a scientist.
[02:00:14.572 --> 02:00:19.451]   All the things they're doing wrong, we intend to expose that in excruciating detail.
[02:00:19.451 --> 02:00:20.451]  Because it's not just Christian.
[02:00:20.451 --> 02:00:25.731]   We have other experts as well who have come forward and are going to be providing testimony
[02:00:25.731 --> 02:00:30.091]   and evidence to say this is how it should be done and this is how it's not being done.
[02:00:30.091 --> 02:00:35.851]   And we intend to hold them accountable because if we can't go to a court of law, Mike, to
[02:00:35.851 --> 02:00:40.572]   address these things, to redress these wrongs, where else can we go?
[02:00:40.603 --> 02:00:45.626]  So, you know, that's why we filed this federal lawsuit and we do need support for it.
[02:00:46.166 --> 02:00:51.268]  Anyone who wants to support the lawsuit and support our efforts, we are still in great need of funding for it.
[02:00:51.309 --> 02:00:53.410]  So that's at wethepatriotsusa.org.
[02:00:54.330 --> 02:01:01.294]   I understand, you know, times are tough and but, you know, for the people of East Palestine, Really, times couldn't be any tougher right now.
[02:01:01.414 --> 02:01:03.655]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[02:01:04.035 --> 02:01:15.162]  We the Patriots is one of the top groups that even my listeners told us that they wanted us to support, and we actually gave a donation to your group, as you know, a couple months ago.
[02:01:17.543 --> 02:01:18.564]  Got some money your way.
[02:01:18.584 --> 02:01:23.708]  It wasn't a huge donation, but folks, wethepatriotsusa.org if you want to support this effort.
[02:01:23.748 --> 02:01:29.032]  Now, we're going to be donating lab testing time, instrument time.
[02:01:29.553 --> 02:01:36.918]  And Eric, you had said earlier, what is the current market rate of a dioxin test right now in a commercial lab?
[02:01:37.059 --> 02:01:37.379]  Any idea?
[02:01:38.159 --> 02:01:43.304]  It usually goes for over $1,000 per test, which is pretty high.
[02:01:44.345 --> 02:01:47.548]  But look, they're not going to find dioxin in the air.
[02:01:48.428 --> 02:01:50.630]  They're unlikely to find it in water right now.
[02:01:51.011 --> 02:01:52.352]  They've got to have soot samples.
[02:01:52.372 --> 02:01:53.453]  They have to be compelled.
[02:01:54.194 --> 02:01:56.756]  They've destroyed evidence by backfilling that pit.
[02:01:56.796 --> 02:02:04.783]  They have to go into that pit and take samples and run those samples for dioxins and furans and produce a point source level.
[02:02:05.962 --> 02:02:08.303]  We need to know exactly what was in that fire.
[02:02:08.323 --> 02:02:16.948]  And we need thousands of samples basically just in an expanding radius around Ground Zero right there.
[02:02:16.968 --> 02:02:19.249]  So we're talking many thousands of samples.
[02:02:19.289 --> 02:02:26.293]  And if you keep finding elevated levels of dioxins, then you have to keep going farther and farther away from Ground Zero.
[02:02:26.693 --> 02:02:36.060]   And I can tell you, the instrument, just the instrument to do this, $600,000 for the triple quad mass spec and a GC interface.
[02:02:36.580 --> 02:02:42.423]  Not to mention the lab, the fume hoods, the sample prep, the audits, the inspections, the personnel.
[02:02:42.443 --> 02:02:45.485]  You have to have, you know, trained chemists and analysts to run all of this.
[02:02:45.825 --> 02:02:49.848]  So this is, it's a multi-million dollar effort to even run one test.
[02:02:49.888 --> 02:02:52.669]  We'll be right back with Brian Festa and Eric Coppolino.
[02:02:52.689 --> 02:02:54.530]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:02:54.590 --> 02:02:55.171]  I'm Mike Adams.
[02:02:56.058 --> 02:02:57.459]  Okay, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:02:57.479 --> 02:02:58.119]  Mike Adams here.
[02:02:58.139 --> 02:03:05.523]  We're joined by Attorney Brian Fessa from We the Patriots USA and also Eric Coppolino from PlanetWaves.org, a dioxin expert.
[02:03:05.983 --> 02:03:12.426]  And we also understand we have breaking news from Kristen Megan, who is, I believe, in East Ohio right now.
[02:03:12.986 --> 02:03:16.688]  And to the producers, as soon as you have her on the phone, let me know.
[02:03:16.728 --> 02:03:18.429]  We'll bring her in immediately.
[02:03:18.969 --> 02:03:22.271]  Brian, do you know what breaking news Kristen is going to bring us here?
[02:03:23.856 --> 02:03:29.861]  I do not, but she is the one, or actually Tammy Clark, who's with her as well, is the one that just texted me.
[02:03:29.922 --> 02:03:34.926]  She's there with Kristen and just texted me and said they have some breaking news to report and they'd like to call in.
[02:03:35.006 --> 02:03:38.569]  So I texted your producer and hopefully we're going to make this work.
[02:03:39.378 --> 02:03:39.918]  Okay, all right.
[02:03:40.018 --> 02:03:41.379]  We will break for that.
[02:03:41.419 --> 02:03:44.621]  I mean, we'll jump right to that as soon as we have a connection with Kristen.
[02:03:45.642 --> 02:03:49.284]  But Eric, and thank you for staying with us, Eric, for this segment.
[02:03:49.884 --> 02:03:53.987]  You know, at some point, the dam of the cover-up breaks wide open, doesn't it?
[02:03:54.107 --> 02:03:59.490]  Are you still calling for an evacuation as a precautionary principle until we know more?
[02:04:00.706 --> 02:04:01.246]  Yeah, of course.
[02:04:01.266 --> 02:04:13.389]  It doesn't make any sense to have a release where there's certain to be dioxin and then you wait for the testing and you leave the people there to build up, you know, to accumulate higher body burdens.
[02:04:14.009 --> 02:04:28.610]   The pregnant women have to get out immediately, the children have to be removed immediately, and then in order, kind of like on the Titanic, you know, girls and women who plan to have babies and everyone. I mean, there's no reason for anyone to be
[02:04:28.610 --> 02:04:31.110]  there right now while this mystery is hanging over.
[02:04:31.110 --> 02:04:35.010]   It's like if you're in a hotel, we've all had this happen, you're in a hotel
[02:04:35.010 --> 02:04:41.010]   and the alarm goes off at 3 o'clock in the morning, you don't wait until you smell smoke,
[02:04:41.010 --> 02:04:46.010]   you're standing out there in your bathrobe along with everybody else out in the parking lot.
[02:04:46.042 --> 02:04:46.503]  Exactly.
[02:04:46.703 --> 02:04:48.184]  Eric, sorry to cut you off.
[02:04:48.324 --> 02:04:51.927]  We've got now joining us by phone with some breaking news from East Ohio.
[02:04:51.967 --> 02:04:54.750]  I believe it's Kristen Megan who is an industrial hygienist.
[02:04:55.770 --> 02:04:57.992]  Kristen, if you can hear me, welcome to the show.
[02:04:58.012 --> 02:04:59.794]  Yes, thank you.
[02:04:59.854 --> 02:05:09.362]  So we are actually traveling and I was listening and I want to tell you something that I figured out yesterday and it's blowing my mind that not a single person that I know of has addressed this.
[02:05:09.850 --> 02:05:12.851]  So my colleague Tammy Clark and I were on the ground.
[02:05:12.871 --> 02:05:24.756]  We dealt with a lot of coughing, a lot of issues, and it brought me back to my Air Force days where I worked at a depot maintenance base and they would stand C5, C1, and guess what they were containing?
[02:05:25.336 --> 02:05:31.278]  Cadmium, chromium, chrome 6, all these what OSHA considers expanded standards.
[02:05:32.258 --> 02:05:39.021]  Nobody is paying attention to the airborne hazards now from burning the actual rail cars.
[02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:51.306]  So I think, actually, a massive exposure that's being ignored is these exposures to these carcinogenic metals and everyone talking about the metallic taste, which we had, and it made my tongue tingle and go numb.
[02:05:51.746 --> 02:05:56.068]  That is what happens when you're exposed to cadmium chromate, strontium chromate.
[02:05:56.649 --> 02:06:04.373]  So this is not only just the metals from the cars, but whatever the corrosion control coatings and paints that existed on those cars.
[02:06:04.873 --> 02:06:11.478]   So these are things that also need to be part of the demanded testing, and it explains There's so much that I saw on the ground.
[02:06:12.258 --> 02:06:12.818]  Okay, okay.
[02:06:12.918 --> 02:06:14.498]  Very important point, Kristen.
[02:06:14.798 --> 02:06:16.199]  And stay on the phone with us now.
[02:06:17.939 --> 02:06:20.820]  The cadmium is a cancer-causing heavy metal.
[02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:22.860]  That's something that we can test for right now, by the way.
[02:06:22.921 --> 02:06:31.343]  So if you can get samples from that area, we can run ICP-MS testing using MassSpec for the elemental analysis and look at cadmium.
[02:06:32.583 --> 02:06:34.404]  I think you mentioned hexavalent chromium.
[02:06:35.085 --> 02:06:36.866]  That is a different test.
[02:06:37.626 --> 02:06:42.750]  We can test for chromium as an element, but not the molecule known as hexavalent chromium.
[02:06:43.190 --> 02:06:46.012]  That's a different test, but get samples while you can there.
[02:06:46.072 --> 02:06:47.513]  Now, Kristen, one more question.
[02:06:48.153 --> 02:06:49.234]  You mentioned some of the reports.
[02:06:49.574 --> 02:06:55.778]  What are the symptoms that people are telling you they're experiencing on the ground right now as they return to East Palestine?
[02:06:57.479 --> 02:07:06.403]   Headache, fatigue, and I guess the best way to explain it, because I felt it, It's like having full mild acid reflux all the way down your airway.
[02:07:07.724 --> 02:07:15.609]  It's a very, I know this sounds silly, but I can't think of a name that reminds me of those candies from the 80s that are hard-shelled and when you bite into them they fizz.
[02:07:16.089 --> 02:07:18.291]  That's what the back of your tongue starts to feel like.
[02:07:18.791 --> 02:07:28.693]   So when I'm thinking of synergistic toxicity and all these different exposures with the same target organs, I'm thinking, oh my gosh, this reminds me of a time I was in the military and people were wearing the wrong Okay.
[02:07:28.533 --> 02:07:31.213]  PPE and they were being exposed to these metals.
[02:07:31.213 --> 02:07:34.893]   But one thing I wanted to point out real quick, Mike, is I understand this
[02:07:34.893 --> 02:07:38.372]   doesn't happen in the environment, but I'm sure you are aware of in my field.
[02:07:38.372 --> 02:07:41.892]   Um, when we have these types of expanded standards, whether it's
[02:07:41.892 --> 02:07:45.993]   lead abatement, asbestos abatement, um, they're called regulated areas when
[02:07:45.993 --> 02:07:48.912]  we're cleaning up the space of exposure.
[02:07:48.921 --> 02:07:52.342]  So you see how friable asbestos is a regulated area, and guess what?
[02:07:52.462 --> 02:07:53.602]  No employees can go in there.
[02:07:54.002 --> 02:08:00.644]  So what they need to do is they need to stop with the absolute negligent and purposely wrongful testing.
[02:08:00.964 --> 02:08:12.168]  They need to do swipe sampling, which will only provide presence abscess, but someone needs to go in there with a HAB site, a hazardous pollutant on-site device, that's GCMS, that can really catch the unknown.
[02:08:12.308 --> 02:08:23.575]   Because They are not doing an all-hazard approach, and they are blowing air into the water of the creek, and they're using aerating devices, and it's going back up into the breathing zone.
[02:08:23.595 --> 02:08:30.219]  So when they're using these PID detectors, which are, you know, it's laughable to say that that's any form of air sampling.
[02:08:31.099 --> 02:08:34.441]  Again, it's more presence-absence, and it's not contaminant-specific.
[02:08:34.822 --> 02:08:36.723]  All of this is going back into the breathing zone.
[02:08:37.059 --> 02:08:38.380]  They need to sample surfaces.
[02:08:38.420 --> 02:08:40.982]  We use something called ghost wipes in the lab.
[02:08:41.382 --> 02:08:50.128]  By the way, a ghost wipe is something that wipes a surface, gathers material, and then the ghost wipe vanishes or dissolves into the sample prep solution.
[02:08:50.628 --> 02:08:51.749]  Let's go to Brian Festa.
[02:08:51.829 --> 02:08:54.751]  By the way, thank you, Kristen, for your report on the ground there.
[02:08:54.791 --> 02:08:55.432]  Let's go to Brian.
[02:08:56.232 --> 02:09:03.798]  Talk to us about the long-term medical costs that are likely to emerge from this and who is going to pay those medical costs.
[02:09:05.526 --> 02:09:11.791]  Well, in my opinion, and again, I am not a scientist like you all are who are on with me today.
[02:09:12.532 --> 02:09:20.159]  But in my opinion, this is the worst chemical disaster on American soil in our lifetimes, at the very least, if not ever.
[02:09:21.139 --> 02:09:29.446]  You know, people compare, you know, I was on a Twitter space recently and people are trying to talk about, oh, well, no, there's the Exxon Valdez and other things.
[02:09:29.486 --> 02:09:36.835]   But as far as the human cost, Across human lives, I think this could be the greatest disaster we've ever seen.
[02:09:36.855 --> 02:09:43.781]  And it will be years that we'll continue seeing, if not decades, that we'll continue seeing the effects of this.
[02:09:44.802 --> 02:09:52.029]  I think you could be talking, Mike, I mean, if you're talking about mass tort action, I wouldn't be surprised if you saw, you know, a billion dollars.
[02:09:53.210 --> 02:09:57.332]  Somewhere in that range, as some kind of a settlement or an award.
[02:09:57.733 --> 02:10:04.277]  If there's an award, that would not surprise me because of the loss of life and the devastation to public health.
[02:10:04.357 --> 02:10:05.118]  Let me jump in here, Brian.
[02:10:05.138 --> 02:10:05.958]  I'm sorry to cut you off.
[02:10:06.699 --> 02:10:09.420]  I just got confirmation, and Eric, you're going to love this.
[02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:14.364]  I just got confirmation by text that we have, I'm going to be interviewing an EPA whistleblower.
[02:10:14.904 --> 02:10:18.947]  So there's an EPA whistleblower that's stepping forward that's going to do an interview with me.
[02:10:18.987 --> 02:10:21.409]  It looks like that's getting set up for next week.
[02:10:22.070 --> 02:10:23.971]  I'll bring you more details about that.
[02:10:24.352 --> 02:10:26.954]  And of course, we'll post that on band.video as well.
[02:10:27.955 --> 02:10:33.759]  Eric, your thoughts, Eric, about the long-term health care costs associated with this?
[02:10:33.819 --> 02:10:42.666]  Because that can easily run, you know, I mean, just depending on how widespread the damage is, there may never be enough money to compensate people for the long-term health complications.
[02:10:42.686 --> 02:10:43.267]  Your thoughts, Eric?
[02:10:43.940 --> 02:10:52.770]  No, this is completely unprecedented, and it should have been planned for, but it was not, and nothing like this has ever happened before.
[02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:57.455]  But we're talking about medical monitoring for 20, 30 years, basically indefinitely.
[02:10:58.356 --> 02:11:03.121]  If we're just talking dioxin, it's at least a three-generation poison.
[02:11:06.564 --> 02:11:14.690]  Lawsuits for glyphosate, even in individual people, are bringing in $250 million or more.
[02:11:14.710 --> 02:11:20.634]  A billion here is absolutely nothing in terms of being able to take care of people.
[02:11:20.754 --> 02:11:27.640]  Plus, we've got a problem of needing to monitor food throughout the entire region because there's 125,000 farms in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
[02:11:31.082 --> 02:11:33.263]  And many of them are very small family farms.
[02:11:33.283 --> 02:11:42.786]  They're the kind of grass-fed farms you depend upon when you go to a health food store and you buy like grass-fed bison or organic chicken.
[02:11:42.806 --> 02:11:49.368]  They're coming from these small farms in this area and they are very concerned and they do not know what to tell their customers.
[02:11:50.528 --> 02:11:54.029]  And they want to be honest with their customers but they don't know what to say.
[02:11:55.225 --> 02:11:55.906]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:11:56.006 --> 02:12:03.173]  And the EPA is actually causing economic damage to all those farmers by not doing the dioxin testing and not releasing the results of that.
[02:12:03.333 --> 02:12:10.461]  If, indeed, there are no dioxins in that area, why wouldn't they share the test results and announce that, you know, and clear the farms?
[02:12:10.481 --> 02:12:11.502]  There's zero chance of that.
[02:12:11.622 --> 02:12:12.603]  There's zero chance of that.
[02:12:12.623 --> 02:12:13.324]  Yeah, I know, I know.
[02:12:14.204 --> 02:12:17.668]  Because of cause and effect and molecules and the table of elements as well.
[02:12:17.688 --> 02:12:18.389]  But yeah, go ahead, Brian.
[02:12:20.090 --> 02:12:20.630]  Thank you, Mike.
[02:12:20.710 --> 02:12:30.559]  And if that EPA whistleblower is willing to speak with us, please, please do connect him or her to us because that person could be very, very useful in our lawsuit.
[02:12:30.599 --> 02:12:33.001]  And Eric, also, I believe I have your email.
[02:12:33.061 --> 02:12:36.845]  I'm going to be reaching out to you if you're willing to lend some of your expertise.
[02:12:37.305 --> 02:12:40.268]  We may be able to use that as well in our suit.
[02:12:40.988 --> 02:12:43.691]  And I've been qualified as an expert witness in these cases, so yes.
[02:12:44.995 --> 02:12:46.496]  Let me thank all of you for joining me.
[02:12:46.516 --> 02:12:48.139]  I want to thank Chris and Megan on the phone.

[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:12.321]  This is major breaking news that you just saw here today.
[02:13:12.801 --> 02:13:14.142]  Share this video everywhere.

[02:13:23.847 --> 02:13:24.487]  I'm Mike Adams.
[02:13:24.547 --> 02:13:25.188]  God bless you all.
[02:13:41.448 --> 02:13:47.488]   Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to mfullworldstore.com
[02:13:47.488 --> 02:13:52.168]   and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body,

[02:13:53.367 --> 02:13:59.728]   I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of you for years,
[02:13:59.728 --> 02:14:01.728]  and never gone to mfullworldstore.com.
[02:14:01.728 --> 02:14:07.408]   We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to mfullworldstore.com
[02:14:07.408 --> 02:14:10.608]   and never experience these great products and never found the operation.
[02:14:10.608 --> 02:14:13.648]   I'm sure you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[02:14:13.648 --> 02:14:15.008]  That's great, and I thank you.
[02:14:15.008 --> 02:14:16.567]  But we need funds to operate.
[02:14:16.486 --> 02:14:25.168]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our Fizzy Magnesium, and our Sleep Aid, and our Nitric Oxide, and our Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:14:25.348 --> 02:14:27.749]  All of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[02:14:27.809 --> 02:14:29.489]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[02:14:29.589 --> 02:14:30.629]  So get off the bench.
[02:14:30.869 --> 02:14:31.529]  Get in the game.
[02:14:31.750 --> 02:14:38.491]  Step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:14:40.874 --> 02:14:45.538]  Owen Schroer now hosting the fourth hour here of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:14:46.759 --> 02:14:50.903]  And I was watching Mike Adams host with the great guests.
[02:14:53.925 --> 02:14:58.449]  And as Mike said before he signed off, this is breaking news, this is huge news, and I'm reacting to it.
[02:14:58.469 --> 02:14:59.490]  I'm like, yeah, okay.
[02:15:00.311 --> 02:15:04.894]  You can't really... How do you not go back to that subject?
[02:15:05.970 --> 02:15:28.260]  But what I like to do, and this is why InfoWars is so important, and we've done this with so many other stories, it's the human intelligence angle, and the human intelligence aspect of what we do here, to have the experts on, and then break a news story, and then call and have people on the ground confirm it.
[02:15:29.198 --> 02:15:31.739]  And so that's what we're going to do here in the fourth hour.
[02:15:31.819 --> 02:15:50.843]  So if you are in the East Palestine, Ohio area, or an area affected by this, because we just saw a report yesterday where dead deer are popping up all along these creeks and riverbanks around East Palestine now.
[02:15:50.943 --> 02:15:52.944]  No gunshot wounds, no nothing, just dead.
[02:15:53.124 --> 02:15:56.725]  I mean, who knows as to why, but that was being reported yesterday.
[02:15:56.765 --> 02:15:57.485]  We played that clip.
[02:15:59.045 --> 02:16:07.308]  So, the situation doesn't seem to be getting better other than just time is passing.
[02:16:09.489 --> 02:16:18.872]  And some of the reporters that went there said that they could tell it just felt different in the air, their skin felt a little different after being there and then leaving and coming home.
[02:16:21.893 --> 02:16:46.645]   But you can only imagine what it's like Last month in East Palestine, the month of February, 2023, from a train derailment to a chemical bombing, essentially, you get napalm, you get chemical napalm, done by Norfolk Southern.
[02:16:49.526 --> 02:16:53.687]  And now, in the aftermath, you realize that that was like the worst decision they could have made.
[02:16:54.167 --> 02:16:56.748]  Of all the decisions, they chose the worst!
[02:17:01.078 --> 02:17:02.179]  It really makes you wonder.
[02:17:07.002 --> 02:17:12.767]  But is the town just going to be devastated by this forever?
[02:17:13.707 --> 02:17:14.428]  In their water?
[02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:18.571]  How long is it going to take for them to recover?
[02:17:19.898 --> 02:17:21.879]  Or is everything just fine?
[02:17:21.899 --> 02:17:25.200]  In fact, you know, I'm sure it's no big deal.
[02:17:25.521 --> 02:17:31.003]  Oh, you see, because you're actually in the year 3,023.
[02:17:31.083 --> 02:17:31.963]  You think it's the year 2023?
[02:17:32.404 --> 02:17:32.924]  No.
[02:17:33.264 --> 02:17:48.131]  It's the year 3,023, and you're getting hit with weather weapons, and you're getting hit with chemical explosions, and infrastructure collapse, and biological weapons, and chemical weapons, and poisoned mandatory injections, population control.
[02:17:49.091 --> 02:17:50.792]  No, that's just the world that you're in now.
[02:17:52.093 --> 02:17:55.876]  And I think people are finally starting to get it and look around like, what is going on?
[02:17:55.956 --> 02:17:56.756]  All these disasters.
[02:17:56.776 --> 02:18:01.960]  So, I want to take calls from people in Ohio or that area if you have friends and family and you're talking to them.
[02:18:02.980 --> 02:18:05.602]  Do they have any hope for the future?
[02:18:05.742 --> 02:18:09.685]  Are they seeing the effects in the water and the food still?
[02:18:09.765 --> 02:18:10.485]  Are they concerned?
[02:18:10.766 --> 02:18:11.786]  Have we heard from the Amish?
[02:18:11.826 --> 02:18:13.367]  I'm not hearing anything about that angle.
[02:18:14.128 --> 02:18:16.149]  What about all the Amish farmers in the area?
[02:18:16.730 --> 02:18:18.251]  Are they going to be feeling the impact of this?
[02:18:19.591 --> 02:18:30.279]  So I'm going to give out the number now, I'll give it back out on the other side as well, just because a lot of radio stations don't pick up this first five minutes.
[02:18:30.299 --> 02:18:30.839]  877-789-2539.
[02:18:30.859 --> 02:18:31.220]  877-789-2539.
[02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:42.308]  So, if you're in the Ohio area, the East Palestine area, and you want to respond to that, or just tell us what it's been like, please give us a call.
[02:18:42.368 --> 02:18:48.979]   And this is just, I just want to You're not going to see this story, and you have to wonder, what was the big story?
[02:18:49.099 --> 02:18:55.922]  Even CNN and MSNBC last night talking about COVID coming from a Chinese laboratory.
[02:18:57.643 --> 02:18:57.783]  Oh.
[02:18:58.903 --> 02:18:59.023]  Oh.
[02:19:00.564 --> 02:19:02.485]  Three years later, they're going to tell you that.
[02:19:02.705 --> 02:19:03.605]  What is that about?
[02:19:06.807 --> 02:19:07.567]  What is that about?
[02:19:10.578 --> 02:19:20.945]  Remember, Tucker Carlson played a compilation last night of maybe 1% of what he could have played, of all the news and everybody telling you it's fake news, fake news that it came out of Wuhan lab, conspiracy theory.
[02:19:21.025 --> 02:19:22.386]  Oh, now they want you to think that.
[02:19:22.546 --> 02:19:22.886]  Why?
[02:19:22.906 --> 02:19:29.110]  Alright, the calls are already pouring in from Ohio right now.
[02:19:30.351 --> 02:19:39.965]   We gave out the phone number after all that incredible Reporting from Mike Adams and his guests on the situation in East Palestine.
[02:19:40.445 --> 02:19:51.510]  I wanted to go to Ground Zero in Ohio or Pennsylvania or anybody in the surrounding areas that's seeing the effects of this and the callers are already lining up.
[02:19:51.911 --> 02:19:52.711]  The number to get in 877-789-2539.
[02:19:57.577 --> 02:20:09.123]  And this is part of the important aspects of InfoWars is the human intelligence, this mothership of communication of a lot of people that are banned.
[02:20:09.323 --> 02:20:12.844]  Not just the people here on the air, but the crew, the audience.
[02:20:14.765 --> 02:20:16.066]  So how do we communicate?
[02:20:16.106 --> 02:20:16.966]  How do we get the truth out?
[02:20:16.986 --> 02:20:18.427]  We know it's being hidden from us.
[02:20:18.467 --> 02:20:19.768]  We know the mainstream media lies.
[02:20:19.808 --> 02:20:20.788]  We know our government lies.
[02:20:21.388 --> 02:20:22.609]  How do we communicate?
[02:20:22.649 --> 02:20:26.571]  Well, this is one of the big platforms right here, and that's why they want to take it down.
[02:20:28.422 --> 02:20:30.925]  The good news is we are listener supported.
[02:20:31.245 --> 02:20:33.088]  So they can't go after big corporate sponsors.
[02:20:33.108 --> 02:20:38.014]  They can't threaten us with big corporate sponsors pulling out or telling us what we can and can't report on.
[02:20:38.034 --> 02:20:39.275]  That's the beauty of things around here.
[02:20:40.196 --> 02:20:51.017]   Listener supported with your support at InfoWarsStore.com And of course we have the great supplements, all the great products, and Alex's new book.
[02:20:51.897 --> 02:20:54.598]  The final signed copies on sale right now.
[02:20:55.038 --> 02:20:55.698]  Alex's new book.
[02:20:55.778 --> 02:20:56.758]  Final signed copies.
[02:20:56.778 --> 02:20:57.639]  He's done signing them.
[02:20:58.379 --> 02:21:00.399]  I would imagine he's probably sick of it by now.
[02:21:01.179 --> 02:21:02.140]  So this is it.
[02:21:02.380 --> 02:21:03.400]  Final signed copies.
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:04.240]  Alex Jones.
[02:21:04.940 --> 02:21:08.221]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:21:09.421 --> 02:21:10.381]  And we're listener supported.
[02:21:10.421 --> 02:21:11.461]  You make it all possible.
[02:21:12.062 --> 02:21:13.022]  So we thank you for that.
[02:21:14.727 --> 02:21:15.948]  I'm only doing this hour today.
[02:21:16.008 --> 02:21:17.928]  I've got legal stuff going on in and out of court.
[02:21:19.109 --> 02:21:24.631]  And so I just give a big shout out to the audience that has also supported me through that.
[02:21:24.991 --> 02:21:32.154]  And let's just remember that I am fortunate of many of these defendants to not be rotting in a jail cell.
[02:21:33.055 --> 02:21:33.655]  And many are.
[02:21:34.475 --> 02:21:35.796]  And so let's not forget about them.
[02:21:36.816 --> 02:21:48.409]   And let's not forget about the Lack of humanity that we have from the current Democrat Party to be holding political prisoners for political stunts per their agenda.
[02:21:49.569 --> 02:21:50.930]  Mostly against Donald Trump.
[02:21:52.851 --> 02:21:58.953]  And of course to, well, turn America into whatever diabolical hellhole they have in mind.
[02:22:00.153 --> 02:22:04.274]  But hell, you know, these are the people that celebrate abortion.
[02:22:05.535 --> 02:22:06.295]  That's what they do.
[02:22:07.836 --> 02:22:08.556]  So what do you expect?
[02:22:09.821 --> 02:22:13.844]  If you don't want to buy a product at InfoWareStore.com, you can also go right there and click the donate tab.
[02:22:14.385 --> 02:22:16.867]  And that's how everything we do here is possible.
[02:22:16.987 --> 02:22:17.747]  We thank you for that.
[02:22:18.308 --> 02:22:19.929]  Okay, guys, we're ready to go.
[02:22:19.969 --> 02:22:24.953]  We've already got a bunch of callers from even East Palestine on the line.
[02:22:25.894 --> 02:22:29.857]  And so let's start with Julie, who's from East Palestine in Ohio.
[02:22:29.917 --> 02:22:32.019]  Julie, you are on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:32.059 --> 02:22:32.399]  Go ahead.
[02:22:32.419 --> 02:22:35.602]  Taking my call.
[02:22:36.935 --> 02:22:39.636]  Um, so I, I grew up in East Palestine.
[02:22:39.656 --> 02:22:45.178]  I live just outside of town now, but my parents, my family all still live there.
[02:22:45.198 --> 02:22:47.479]  Um, and it's just a mess.
[02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:52.622]  We just, we don't know what to believe and we don't know what's going to happen long term.
[02:22:53.602 --> 02:22:57.544]  Now, is your family still there or have they, have they left?
[02:22:58.764 --> 02:23:00.325]  They evacuated initially.
[02:23:00.505 --> 02:23:05.607]  So my father is about a quarter mile from ground zero of the actual derailment.
[02:23:06.232 --> 02:23:12.623]  So he was evacuated that Friday on the 3rd, and he was gone for about a week to 10 days.
[02:23:13.404 --> 02:23:19.893]   Then the EPA came in, they told him it was safe, and so he did go home because he was Sick of not being at home.
[02:23:20.854 --> 02:23:25.257]  He's 72, he has one lung, and he's already survived cancer.
[02:23:25.697 --> 02:23:29.760]  So I'm extremely concerned about what this is doing to him.
[02:23:29.860 --> 02:23:33.002]  I've begged him to leave, to come closer to where I am.
[02:23:33.062 --> 02:23:37.505]  I'm about 30 miles away, but he's lived there his whole life.
[02:23:37.926 --> 02:23:38.967]  This town is deep-rooted.
[02:23:39.687 --> 02:23:42.169]  People have lived there for generations and they don't want to leave.
[02:23:44.491 --> 02:23:56.558]  Man, one lung and still toughing it out after the chemical fire that just engulfed a large land mass right outside of your town and he goes back in.
[02:23:56.578 --> 02:24:01.581]  And is he telling you that he's having any problems breathing or anything like that?
[02:24:02.521 --> 02:24:04.583]  He's telling me everything is fine.
[02:24:05.423 --> 02:24:07.905]  But I can hear in his voice labored breathing.
[02:24:08.365 --> 02:24:10.346]  Yesterday when I talked to him he was coughing.
[02:24:10.859 --> 02:24:13.501]  And I questioned him, what's going on?
[02:24:13.541 --> 02:24:14.302]  Why are you coughing?
[02:24:14.322 --> 02:24:16.604]  And he said, he's got the cold that's going around town.
[02:24:16.624 --> 02:24:21.228]  The cold that's going around town?
[02:24:22.209 --> 02:24:23.190]  That's reassuring.
[02:24:23.890 --> 02:24:25.832]  Everyone has flu-like symptoms right now.
[02:24:26.593 --> 02:24:30.596]  And a lot of people are having nosebleeds.
[02:24:30.616 --> 02:24:35.080]  A couple of the girls I went to high school with, they work right downtown, right behind the railroad tracks.
[02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:38.153]   I mean, the tracks run straight through the middle of town.
[02:24:38.153 --> 02:24:41.672]   So all of the businesses in town, they're right there by the track.
[02:24:41.672 --> 02:24:45.473]  So they're all having no sleet issues, rashes on their skin.
[02:24:45.473 --> 02:24:48.913]  A lot of my friends have hair falling out.
[02:24:48.913 --> 02:24:51.753]  It's it's just I don't even know what to do.
[02:24:51.753 --> 02:24:53.713]  Gosh. Yeah.
[02:24:53.713 --> 02:25:00.272]   Are they hearing about any other any other news with like pets and animals?
[02:25:00.292 --> 02:25:04.115]  Because we saw a bunch of animals dying right after this.
[02:25:04.155 --> 02:25:07.418]  Now we're seeing dead deer along riverbanks and creek banks.
[02:25:08.079 --> 02:25:10.881]  We are seeing dead deer right outside of town.
[02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:20.814]  Um, not so much in town, it's mostly smaller animals, wildlife, like, you know, the minnows in the creek immediately were just floating dead within 24 hours.
[02:25:20.854 --> 02:25:30.058]  Yeah, I mean, that basically, that getting into the water basically nuked whatever was in that water and probably any deer that drank it are probably just on, you know, a timer at this point, I guess.
[02:25:30.677 --> 02:25:30.857]  Right.
[02:25:30.917 --> 02:25:38.623]  But the good news is we are starting to see, for the first few days after they did that, quote unquote, controlled burn, there was no bird song.
[02:25:38.943 --> 02:25:41.805]  There were no little critters like squirrels and chipmunks running around.
[02:25:41.845 --> 02:25:46.148]  But we're starting, my dad's saying, the past few days, he's been woken up by the birds chirping.
[02:25:46.628 --> 02:25:50.331]  So that's positive to me, because we did see a lot of dead birds in the area.
[02:25:50.671 --> 02:25:55.534]  And as far as bigger animals, the dogs, the cats, my friend is a cattle farmer.
[02:25:55.614 --> 02:26:04.177]   Her cattle, her goats, They all seem to be okay, but their water sources on their pasture had to be fenced off because they're all covered in a film.
[02:26:04.197 --> 02:26:10.242]  So they're having to bring in, you know, bottled water for their cows, for their bigger animals.
[02:26:10.362 --> 02:26:12.544]  It's not sustainable long term at all.
[02:26:12.644 --> 02:26:14.926]  Yeah, that's, that's tough.
[02:26:14.946 --> 02:26:16.047]  I don't know how you do that.
[02:26:16.067 --> 02:26:21.693]  And we get a lot of a lot of plastic gallon of water coming in to that.
[02:26:21.753 --> 02:26:23.034]  Well, President Trump.
[02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:24.381]  A lot of water.
[02:26:24.401 --> 02:26:28.404]  That was, you know, we got water from Trump, but we haven't gotten anything from Biden.
[02:26:29.225 --> 02:26:30.085]  Oh yeah, Biden.
[02:26:30.165 --> 02:26:31.366]  Yeah, he's not interested.
[02:26:31.827 --> 02:26:32.407]  No, no, no.
[02:26:32.608 --> 02:26:33.548]  You don't bring Biden up.
[02:26:34.329 --> 02:26:34.529]  No.
[02:26:34.829 --> 02:26:36.611]  But Booty Judge gave him a visit.
[02:26:36.651 --> 02:26:38.392]  He stopped by for a camera moment.
[02:26:38.773 --> 02:26:39.954]  You know, he had a Kodak moment.
[02:26:39.994 --> 02:26:41.595]  He had his photo op and he left.
[02:26:42.436 --> 02:26:42.656]  Yep.
[02:26:42.836 --> 02:26:43.897]  Yeah, he didn't do anything.
[02:26:45.398 --> 02:26:47.140]  Well now, Booty Judge...
[02:26:47.995 --> 02:26:54.224]  Now Buttigieg is Inspector General to audit Pete Buttigieg's use of FAA planes.
[02:26:54.785 --> 02:26:57.909]  This is like Sam Brinton stealing luggage.
[02:26:57.949 --> 02:27:00.452]  Pete Buttigieg just flies around on the government's jets.
[02:27:01.153 --> 02:27:01.674]  And he says...
[02:27:02.645 --> 02:27:16.708]  I don't know if he used one to fly to East Palestine, but he says, I mostly fly on commercial flights in economy class, and when I do use our agency's aircraft, it's usually a situation where doing so saves taxpayer money.
[02:27:17.148 --> 02:27:22.289]  I'm not sure how flying private would ever save taxpayer money, but that's his excuse.
[02:27:24.330 --> 02:27:29.111]  Well, he just needs to send more black construction workers to East Palestine, and then we'll be fine.
[02:27:29.841 --> 02:27:30.081]  Hmm.
[02:27:30.642 --> 02:27:31.462]  That's his solution.
[02:27:31.943 --> 02:27:33.704]  Alright, Julie, thank you so much for that report.
[02:27:35.465 --> 02:27:37.707]  From what you hear from your family in East Palestine.
[02:27:37.727 --> 02:27:38.627]  Let's go to Casey.
[02:27:38.667 --> 02:27:40.449]  Same situation with family in East Palestine.
[02:27:40.469 --> 02:27:41.169]  Casey, go ahead.
[02:27:41.189 --> 02:27:45.713]  Hello?
[02:27:46.093 --> 02:27:46.693]  Yes, Casey.
[02:27:47.914 --> 02:27:49.395]  Yeah, hey Owen.
[02:27:51.117 --> 02:27:52.478]  I don't even know what to say right now.
[02:27:52.518 --> 02:27:55.820]  I'm just so curious over the whole situation.
[02:27:56.220 --> 02:28:02.832]   I have family I have my parents, I have children, all living in East Palestine.
[02:28:04.934 --> 02:28:08.197]  You know, my son goes to work every day, directly across the street from the drill.
[02:28:08.377 --> 02:28:11.780]  Yeah, there's a school.
[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:15.002]  I mean, how far is it from the site?
[02:28:16.363 --> 02:28:19.586]  Well, the business, no, my son, he's grown.
[02:28:19.826 --> 02:28:20.247]  He's grown.
[02:28:20.327 --> 02:28:22.168]  I'm 45 years old.
[02:28:24.284 --> 02:28:29.709]  My son goes to work directly across the street, directly across the street from the derailment.
[02:28:33.473 --> 02:28:34.574]  Yeah, he's got a newborn.
[02:28:35.935 --> 02:28:37.176]  You know, he's still working.
[02:28:37.276 --> 02:28:38.798]  You know, he's got a support family.
[02:28:38.818 --> 02:28:39.599]  He just bought a house.
[02:28:40.620 --> 02:28:42.661]  You know, it's on the other end of town, the house is.
[02:28:44.443 --> 02:28:47.266]  And then my parents own a small farm up the road.
[02:28:48.459 --> 02:28:56.764]  Well, you said how angry you were, so let me just put you on hold here through the break and you can tell us your frustrations, but I think we can probably imagine, folks.
[02:28:57.684 --> 02:29:00.085]  I think we can probably imagine the frustrations of the people there.
[02:29:01.146 --> 02:29:02.667]  Alright, this is breaking right now.
[02:29:03.147 --> 02:29:07.169]  Train derails in Manatee County near Sarasota Bradenton Airport.
[02:29:08.750 --> 02:29:17.195]  Hazmat crews are responding after a train came partially off the tracks in Manatee County this morning.
[02:29:19.454 --> 02:29:21.954]  A train derailed and six cars tipped over.
[02:29:22.935 --> 02:29:27.335]  One of the cars contains about 30,000 gallons of propane.
[02:29:28.276 --> 02:29:32.937]  Fire and hazmat crews are monitoring the propane car for leaks until it can be righted.
[02:29:34.177 --> 02:29:34.517]  Righted.
[02:29:36.177 --> 02:29:38.818]  So, you know, why don't we just go in there and blow it up?
[02:29:39.598 --> 02:29:39.938]  You know?
[02:29:41.698 --> 02:29:43.098]  That seems to be the idea.
[02:29:44.799 --> 02:29:46.219]  Worked in East Palestine, right?
[02:29:48.787 --> 02:30:01.198]  This one does not appear to be nearly as bad, however, but seems to be every day there's some sort of a train derailment or plant that blows up or a large fire.
[02:30:01.218 --> 02:30:02.559]  I mean, this is just the trend.
[02:30:03.660 --> 02:30:04.801]  This is just the future.
[02:30:05.782 --> 02:30:06.983]  The future you were promised.
[02:30:08.384 --> 02:30:10.206]  We've got more calls from Ohio.
[02:30:10.246 --> 02:30:13.929]  I want to get to talking about finishing up with this East Palestine story.
[02:30:15.040 --> 02:30:17.122]  And let's go to Jason now.
[02:30:17.882 --> 02:30:19.343]  Jason, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:19.363 --> 02:30:19.744]  Go ahead.
[02:30:21.345 --> 02:30:22.266]  What's up, Owen?
[02:30:22.406 --> 02:30:23.526]  Long time listener.
[02:30:23.747 --> 02:30:27.489]  I'm about 24 miles west of the thing.
[02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:29.711]  I work about 12 miles from it.
[02:30:30.432 --> 02:30:34.335]  Every day you can see there's like fallout clouds still floating around.
[02:30:34.595 --> 02:30:41.660]  It's like, I'm a geoengineering watcher, so I'm always looking up and we're getting like, we got like summer thunderstorm clouds.
[02:30:42.341 --> 02:30:45.582]   Everybody here, they're just like, A lot of people are complacent.
[02:30:45.842 --> 02:30:47.904]  The people around there, I mean, I went there.
[02:30:48.784 --> 02:30:50.065]  I'm a health conscious person.
[02:30:50.726 --> 02:30:56.710]  So I can like tell chemicals and five minutes headache, stomachache, girlfriend got a rash.
[02:30:57.131 --> 02:30:59.352]  The people in that area think it's okay.
[02:30:59.392 --> 02:31:00.213]  They're just there.
[02:31:00.653 --> 02:31:01.294]  It's not good.
[02:31:01.414 --> 02:31:02.114]  It's not good there.
[02:31:02.655 --> 02:31:07.759]  And just that chemical load, the more toxins you take in, it just gets worse and worse and worse.
[02:31:08.379 --> 02:31:09.800]  But we just started getting rain.
[02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:11.381]  So that fallout everywhere.
[02:31:11.401 --> 02:31:12.162]  I have a pond.
[02:31:12.322 --> 02:31:13.643]  I had a film on my pond.
[02:31:14.358 --> 02:31:17.921]  Um, I'm checking the drainage ditches every day and taking pictures.
[02:31:18.301 --> 02:31:22.584]  There's this weird, like, brown, filmy, bubbly stuff everywhere.
[02:31:22.604 --> 02:31:28.248]  It's pretty wild, but it's, like, it's widespread, and who knows what that stuff is?
[02:31:28.368 --> 02:31:31.491]  And they're just denying everything, and I don't know.
[02:31:31.831 --> 02:31:36.014]  You're saying the rain caused your pond to have a film on it, too?
[02:31:36.054 --> 02:31:37.075]  Like, the rain caused that?
[02:31:38.610 --> 02:31:44.355]  Yeah, like it rained and then the wind blew in the morning and like pushed like the little film on the top all to one side.
[02:31:44.375 --> 02:31:46.317]  I have videos of all this stuff.
[02:31:46.357 --> 02:31:52.542]  I've been the drainage ditches around like it rains and then this area like the the water all goes to the drainage ditches.
[02:31:53.083 --> 02:32:00.729]  So I've been going to the collection point and there's just like this foam and it's just weird stuff that I've never seen and it's everywhere.
[02:32:00.749 --> 02:32:04.933]  It's like it's stuff you would see next to like a pig farm or something but like it's everywhere.
[02:32:05.447 --> 02:32:08.408]  You said you have these on, you have this on video.
[02:32:09.928 --> 02:32:10.509]  Tons of them.
[02:32:10.749 --> 02:32:12.409]  Give me, what's the email or something?
[02:32:12.449 --> 02:32:13.590]  I'll send you a bunch of them.
[02:32:14.130 --> 02:32:14.450]  Well, sure.
[02:32:14.470 --> 02:32:25.814]  And every day, and I'm 20, I'm 24 miles west and every day I look out my house and you just see like from East Palestine and like when I drive to work, I go to this high range and you can just see this.
[02:32:25.914 --> 02:32:26.714]  It's weird.
[02:32:26.854 --> 02:32:29.155]  I don't know what it is, but it's East Palestine.
[02:32:29.615 --> 02:32:29.875]  Weird.
[02:32:29.935 --> 02:32:44.303]   And then, Like, at night, you can go outside here, and it was super bad, like, the few days after they blew it up, and point a flashlight in the air at night, and it looks like you're in the middle of a blizzard snowstorm with all this stuff.
[02:32:44.663 --> 02:32:45.584]  Who knows what it is?
[02:32:46.084 --> 02:32:47.865]  Just, like, particulate dust?
[02:32:49.026 --> 02:32:51.147]  Yeah, but, like, a lot.
[02:32:51.487 --> 02:32:56.450]  There's a little bit here and there, and there's water vapors, all this, but, I mean, it's crazy to see.
[02:32:57.017 --> 02:32:57.958]  But I don't know.
[02:32:57.978 --> 02:33:00.299]  I don't know if we got to like move or what I'm going to do.
[02:33:00.339 --> 02:33:03.080]  I have a homestead here, like a little mini farm.
[02:33:03.100 --> 02:33:04.441]  Who knows?
[02:33:04.461 --> 02:33:06.282]  It's like, you want to eat that stuff?
[02:33:07.668 --> 02:33:11.472]  Many people are having the same concerns you are.
[02:33:11.852 --> 02:33:19.679]  Let me put you on hold, and let's give Jason an email to send that video to, and we may have the writers write up a story.
[02:33:19.699 --> 02:33:21.321]  They may be interested in writing a story about that.
[02:33:22.122 --> 02:33:27.166]  So yeah, we'll gladly review that video that you have, Jason.
[02:33:27.727 --> 02:33:31.491]  So guys, put him on hold, and we'll get him an email to send it to.
[02:33:31.591 --> 02:33:36.356]   And then, in the meantime, We will go to Craig.
[02:33:37.277 --> 02:33:39.898]  Let's go down to Craig here in Ohio as well.
[02:33:39.938 --> 02:33:40.959]  Craig, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:42.480]  Hey, Owen.
[02:33:44.121 --> 02:33:47.983]  Hi, Craig.
[02:33:49.825 --> 02:33:57.389]  I'm west upstream of the spill, and I'm also west of the spill.
[02:33:57.890 --> 02:34:03.293]  So I'm really not at any super risk, but last weekend I was down in Cincinnati with my daughters for soccer.
[02:34:04.040 --> 02:34:06.681]  And, you know, we had to eat out.
[02:34:06.701 --> 02:34:10.463]  We were crossing over the Ohio River, right, which is all downstream of the spill.
[02:34:11.083 --> 02:34:13.264]  And so I thought, well, we're going to have to eat out.
[02:34:13.284 --> 02:34:15.865]  So I started looking at where the water came from.
[02:34:16.225 --> 02:34:19.026]  And, you know, down in Cincinnati, obviously it's coming right off the river.
[02:34:19.046 --> 02:34:21.747]  And we were staying 30 minutes north.
[02:34:21.767 --> 02:34:33.084]   So I started looking it up and I looked at the Google, you know, and I started seeing that in Cincinnati it said, um, You know, it didn't say anything about a risk of water being contaminated.
[02:34:33.144 --> 02:34:41.166]  But when I looked at the city north where I knew it was safe, it said clearly, you know, no risk of pollution from the water, from the river.
[02:34:41.306 --> 02:34:47.587]  So, so, you know, it's just funny how everybody's covering themselves and protecting themselves.
[02:34:47.767 --> 02:34:53.489]  You know, I knew that, but it's just funny to see it and then watch everybody cover their trail.
[02:34:54.449 --> 02:34:58.270]  It, this concerns me so much because, you know, we go back to COVID.
[02:34:59.106 --> 02:35:01.694]  And, you know, it was all over everywhere.
[02:35:01.935 --> 02:35:03.339]  I mean, it was non-stop, 24-7, right?
[02:35:05.788 --> 02:35:11.571]  The only way that that was a real risk is shoving people into hospitals and injecting or killing them with remdesivir and stuff.
[02:35:11.671 --> 02:35:13.171]  This is an actual real risk.
[02:35:13.371 --> 02:35:13.591]  Right.
[02:35:13.651 --> 02:35:18.854]  And they make the common flu into COVID-19 and they make it the biggest deal ever.
[02:35:18.934 --> 02:35:27.678]  They hide the truth about it in a lab and then they don't talk about this true disaster in East Palestine, this ecological disaster, health disaster, humanitarian disaster.
[02:35:27.718 --> 02:35:28.478]  They don't talk about that.
[02:35:28.518 --> 02:35:29.218]  They build up COVID.
[02:35:29.578 --> 02:35:30.639]  And you know why that is.
[02:35:30.659 --> 02:35:32.100]  That's because they have a narrative.
[02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:32.800]  They have an agenda.
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:38.808]  I want to quickly make sure we at least get Daniel a shot to talk here in this segment before we take a break.
[02:35:38.828 --> 02:35:42.573]  Daniel's a pilot who's in the air right now and wants to comment on what he's seeing.
[02:35:43.134 --> 02:35:44.516]  Daniel, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:44.536 --> 02:35:44.837]  Go ahead.
[02:35:46.167 --> 02:35:49.648]  I apologize for the bad audio here.
[02:35:49.708 --> 02:35:50.449]  I'll do my best.
[02:35:50.648 --> 02:35:56.168]   My I fly for an aerial survey company and my boss who lives about 40 miles to the east of
[02:35:56.168 --> 02:36:03.429]   East Palestine, Ohio and It's just one of the things that she had mentioned to me
[02:36:03.429 --> 02:36:10.207]   was she doesn't understand why all these people are Hitting on radios and TV and stuff and talking like they
[02:36:10.207 --> 02:36:14.167]   know what's going on around there But they're not even getting the name of the town right
[02:36:14.288 --> 02:36:21.929]   She said that the name of the town of East Palestine has always been that way since she was a kid like 50 years ago
[02:36:21.929 --> 02:36:26.968]   and so I'm The arguments the other day, you know, somebody was running
[02:36:26.968 --> 02:36:32.388]   around talking about Chicago They've probably never been to Chicago. They probably know
[02:36:32.388 --> 02:36:37.188]   nothing about Chicago So anybody that wants to call in and act like they've got
[02:36:37.188 --> 02:36:43.738]   some kind of inside information about what's going on there At least get the name of the town right if you're claiming
[02:36:43.738 --> 02:36:49.007]   to be from there Well, I
[02:36:49.007 --> 02:36:54.558]   I'm gonna have to double check on that because The people I've talked to said it is Palestine and when we
[02:36:54.558 --> 02:36:58.528]   have somebody on the crew who's from Ohio who said it's Palestine
[02:36:58.528 --> 02:37:01.836]   So, I don't know I mean, I was told that was the right pronunciation.
[02:37:02.336 --> 02:37:06.538]  You'd think Palestine, but it's... I've been told it's Steen.
[02:37:07.418 --> 02:37:10.940]  Has there ever been a guy... Daniel, are you flying the plane right now?
[02:37:12.635 --> 02:37:15.377]  This has got to be some sort of a landmark occasion.
[02:37:15.197 --> 02:37:19.197]   Hold on, hold on, are you flying right now? Are you literally flying the plane right now?
[02:37:19.197 --> 02:37:26.576]   Oh yes sir, I'm about a thousand feet above Texas right now, flying a pipeline. I call into Harrison's show from the air
[02:37:26.576 --> 02:37:27.197]  all the time.
[02:37:27.197 --> 02:37:32.197]   This has got to be some sort of a landmark occasion. I mean, how often does a guy flying a plane call into a talk show?
[02:37:32.197 --> 02:37:36.197]  What do you got next on your bingo card?
[02:37:36.197 --> 02:37:39.197]  In the year 2023.
[02:37:39.197 --> 02:37:41.197]  What's next?
[02:37:41.427 --> 02:37:42.147]  UFOs?
[02:37:42.407 --> 02:37:42.948]  Aliens?
[02:37:43.948 --> 02:37:45.349]  Chemical explosions?
[02:37:45.489 --> 02:37:46.410]  Train derailments?
[02:37:47.070 --> 02:37:48.371]  Infrastructure collapse?
[02:37:50.333 --> 02:37:51.773]  Biological warfare?
[02:37:52.274 --> 02:37:53.795]  Meteorological warfare?
[02:37:56.737 --> 02:37:59.018]  What comes next?
[02:37:59.038 --> 02:38:03.741]  Alright, we're going to go back to the phone lines here.
[02:38:05.222 --> 02:38:10.106]  We've still got people on the line from Ohio that want to weigh in on what's going on in East Palestine.
[02:38:12.069 --> 02:38:20.773]  877-789-2539 if anybody else from the area wants to comment on the news that broke today on the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[02:38:20.893 --> 02:38:25.695]  Let's go to Jonathan who is in Cincinnati.
[02:38:26.615 --> 02:38:28.516]  Another caller from Cincinnati talking about it.
[02:38:29.196 --> 02:38:29.997]  Jonathan, go ahead.
[02:38:31.097 --> 02:38:32.037]  How you doing, Owen?
[02:38:32.538 --> 02:38:33.278]  Good, thanks for calling.
[02:38:34.578 --> 02:38:47.766]   So, I mean, I remember when at first I came out and then I immediately emailed my local EPA and then she emailed me.
[02:38:47.826 --> 02:38:49.326]  I'm about to go through the email.
[02:38:50.127 --> 02:38:57.770]  She immediately said thanks for reaching out and then she sent me the press release that they sent everybody.
[02:38:57.790 --> 02:39:04.993]  Like I'm just a normal resident trying to get some information about water which should be available to everybody.
[02:39:05.902 --> 02:39:10.764]  And I'm guessing the press release says nothing to worry about, just like the last caller was saying?
[02:39:11.744 --> 02:39:15.005]  Yeah, it said nothing to worry about, everything's good.
[02:39:16.765 --> 02:39:34.331]  But what I'm really trying to call in about is me and some people from my university are putting together a fund to get some crates of water together so we can keep bringing that out to the people in East Palestine.
[02:39:35.134 --> 02:39:49.425]  But, um, I emailed a lot of people, like toxicologists at my university, just to see if it's okay to go out, or precautions to take, and I got nothing, also.
[02:39:49.685 --> 02:39:52.467]  So, looking for some info on that.
[02:39:52.507 --> 02:39:55.950]  Well, take your own water, I would say, for sure.
[02:39:55.970 --> 02:39:56.891]  Yeah.
[02:39:57.771 --> 02:40:00.894]  What, are you at the University of Cincinnati, or what university are you at?
[02:40:01.754 --> 02:40:02.075]  Yeah.
[02:40:03.726 --> 02:40:07.389]  I feel like when I go out, I'm the only one that really is even thinking about it.
[02:40:07.208 --> 02:40:11.208]  Is this a topic that the students talk about?
[02:40:11.208 --> 02:40:17.208]   I feel like when I go out, I'm the only one that really is even thinking about it.
[02:40:17.208 --> 02:40:21.208]  Man, I remember that. I remember that.
[02:40:21.208 --> 02:40:23.208]  I remember that feeling.
[02:40:23.208 --> 02:40:26.208]  It's actually eerie. No, it's actually eerie.
[02:40:26.208 --> 02:40:33.208]   I remember specifically one night, me and a buddy of mine were out drinking at a bar,
[02:40:33.208 --> 02:40:36.808]  And this is when Crimea was being invaded.
[02:40:36.819 --> 02:40:39.179]  And we were talking about it.
[02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:44.460]  And someone behind us was like, overheard us and asked about it or whatever.
[02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:45.421]  We were like, oh, you don't know?
[02:40:45.481 --> 02:40:45.981]  Like, you don't know?
[02:40:46.821 --> 02:40:48.881]  And we realized just nobody knows.
[02:40:49.001 --> 02:40:50.582]  Like, nobody knows anything that's going on.
[02:40:50.982 --> 02:40:53.042]  Nobody knows there's fluoride in the water or cares.
[02:40:53.402 --> 02:40:55.863]  Nobody knows these vaccines aren't safe, aren't effective.
[02:40:56.743 --> 02:40:57.803]  It's just like, it's just crazy.
[02:40:57.823 --> 02:40:58.703]  It's like, oh, nobody knows.
[02:40:58.723 --> 02:40:59.564]  It's like, yeah, big deal.
[02:41:00.064 --> 02:41:00.664]  What's the big deal?
[02:41:02.088 --> 02:41:05.071]  Yeah, you feel, you kind of feel like a burden talking about it.
[02:41:05.091 --> 02:41:06.592]  I mean, Cincinnati, it's not like it's that.
[02:41:06.612 --> 02:41:08.774]  I mean, how far is Cincinnati from East Palestine?
[02:41:09.555 --> 02:41:11.236]  Yeah, we're only four hours away.
[02:41:11.256 --> 02:41:15.480]  That's why I feel like, man, I could do something to help these people out.
[02:41:15.500 --> 02:41:17.121]  I'll go to a big university.
[02:41:17.141 --> 02:41:20.484]  We can get some stuff together, get a U-Haul out there.
[02:41:20.504 --> 02:41:26.229]  Nope, you don't get that as a human interest story, huh?
[02:41:26.770 --> 02:41:27.611]  That's crazy, man.
[02:41:28.385 --> 02:41:31.287]  It's eerie, but that's part of this dystopian future we're in.
[02:41:31.667 --> 02:41:33.508]  That's part of this twilight zone we're in.
[02:41:34.029 --> 02:41:38.331]  Like, you're looking around at the fellow humans and it's like, they don't even know, they don't even care.
[02:41:38.932 --> 02:41:40.273]  Like, uh, okay.
[02:41:41.193 --> 02:41:45.656]  I guess this is why Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab want to eliminate humanity.
[02:41:45.676 --> 02:41:47.718]  I don't know, you know.
[02:41:47.738 --> 02:41:54.202]  That's the issue, too, because I'm from Cleveland and I know, like, you talked about the 15-minute cities out there and...
[02:41:55.026 --> 02:41:58.238]  It's just people are just gonna be like, yeah, it's all good, like.
[02:41:58.962 --> 02:42:00.603]  Just move on in.
[02:42:01.463 --> 02:42:03.485]  Oh, and it's never going to work.
[02:42:03.825 --> 02:42:07.407]  Trying to make the cities we already have into 15-minute cities is never going to work.
[02:42:07.427 --> 02:42:12.710]  You've got to build entirely new infrastructure and everything, which they could do with $150 billion, but that went to Ukraine.
[02:42:13.470 --> 02:42:22.235]  Jonathan, thank you for the call, and best of luck in your endeavors with some of your friends there at University of Cincinnati to try to help the people in East Palestine.
[02:42:22.275 --> 02:42:24.036]  Let's go to Matt in Ohio.
[02:42:24.097 --> 02:42:25.417]  Matt, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:25.437 --> 02:42:25.817]  Go ahead.
[02:42:27.779 --> 02:42:28.399]  How's it going, Owen?
[02:42:29.286 --> 02:42:29.926]  All right, Matt.
[02:42:32.508 --> 02:42:36.910]  I just wanted to say I've had a slight headache in the basement.
[02:42:36.990 --> 02:42:41.573]  I'm 18 miles northeast of East Palestine in Youngstown.
[02:42:42.713 --> 02:42:46.295]  I've had a slight headache for a week and a half, two weeks.
[02:42:47.116 --> 02:42:52.458]  Hasn't been anything too crazy, but just listening to the callers, I'm like, you know what?
[02:42:52.478 --> 02:42:53.599]  It could have something to do with it.
[02:42:53.619 --> 02:43:05.370]   Probably nothing, but Also, I wanted to say one of the local carpenters unions is donating time and resources to the efforts in East Palestine.
[02:43:06.911 --> 02:43:08.013]  Well what's wild is...
[02:43:09.386 --> 02:43:24.477]  We're going to have to find out all this information for ourselves, we the people, independent researchers, investigators, and we're going to find incredible stuff, and it's just going to get ignored by the mainstream media, it's going to get ignored by the U.S.
[02:43:24.517 --> 02:43:32.123]  government and covered up, and then they'll report on it in five years and tell us that they're breaking the exclusive story.
[02:43:34.192 --> 02:43:34.352]  For sure.
[02:43:34.171 --> 02:43:34.671]  For sure.
[02:43:34.671 --> 02:43:37.351]  Just like they're doing with COVID now out of a Chinese lab.
[02:43:37.351 --> 02:43:39.171]  I mean, do you know how laughable that is?
[02:43:39.171 --> 02:43:41.811]  That's hilarious.
[02:43:41.811 --> 02:43:44.430]  It makes me wonder why.
[02:43:44.430 --> 02:43:46.151]  It makes me think something else is going on.
[02:43:46.151 --> 02:43:50.850]   Like this is the information war against China and Biden's like, oh, or whoever,
[02:43:50.850 --> 02:43:55.431]   you know, Biden's probably not even thinking, oh, you want to help Russia?
[02:43:55.546 --> 02:43:56.487]  You want to arm Russia?
[02:43:56.747 --> 02:43:57.147]  Oh, okay.
[02:43:57.187 --> 02:43:59.728]  Well, why don't we tell the world that you made the virus?
[02:43:59.809 --> 02:44:02.790]  It's like, even China's probably like, everybody already knows that.
[02:44:02.850 --> 02:44:04.211]  You guys covered that up for us.
[02:44:04.271 --> 02:44:04.711]  Thank you.
[02:44:08.073 --> 02:44:08.754]  Oh, you're not wrong.
[02:44:09.014 --> 02:44:11.235]  I mean, you really got to think.
[02:44:11.996 --> 02:44:16.098]  Five years ago, we were all crazy.
[02:44:19.400 --> 02:44:29.300]   Anything that was declassified that we want to bring up, You know, it's on paper, it's on record, you can prove it, but it's conspiracy theory.
[02:44:29.620 --> 02:44:37.762]  There was a story, and Matt, thank you for the call, there was a story, I think it was the New York Times, it was like, masks didn't work, or masks don't work.
[02:44:38.863 --> 02:44:41.323]  What did we learn, or what lessons were learned?
[02:44:41.343 --> 02:44:44.104]  I don't remember who published it.
[02:44:45.445 --> 02:44:48.045]   And it's just like, Nothing!
[02:44:48.285 --> 02:44:53.267]  If you're the one that needs to learn the lesson, and if you're asking the question, then the answer is nothing!
[02:44:54.967 --> 02:44:57.108]  The answer is, you were wrong!
[02:44:58.288 --> 02:45:00.789]  But not just about the masks, about everything!
[02:45:02.249 --> 02:45:03.330]  So no, you haven't learned.
[02:45:03.370 --> 02:45:04.910]  I don't know what it's going to take for you to learn.
[02:45:04.930 --> 02:45:08.971]  But you'll never learn.
[02:45:10.532 --> 02:45:14.793]  Write about the Wuhan lab, write about the masks, write about the vaccines.
[02:45:16.144 --> 02:45:17.285]  What lessons were learned?
[02:45:17.305 --> 02:45:21.667]  Well, you're the one that needs to learn lessons, so if you have to ask, you clearly haven't learned.
[02:45:23.228 --> 02:45:24.749]  But it's, like, gonna be the same thing here.
[02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:30.412]  Oh, Biden did a great job, but they don't even claim, they're not even claiming Biden's doing a good job.
[02:45:30.432 --> 02:45:32.073]  They're just acting like it's not a problem.
[02:45:32.974 --> 02:45:37.336]  Like, oh, everything's fine, the water's fine, the air's fine, the land is fine, nothing to see here.
[02:45:38.937 --> 02:45:45.641]  And the fact that there was a movie just released about the exact same scenario four months prior, you know, what's the big deal?
[02:45:47.247 --> 02:45:52.869]  The fact that they ran a simulation with a thing called MyID the week before?
[02:45:52.929 --> 02:45:53.909]  What's the big deal?
[02:45:55.309 --> 02:46:01.351]  The fact that the EPA lowered the standards for what was considered to be a toxic amount of vinyl chloride?
[02:46:02.111 --> 02:46:03.372]  What's the big deal?
[02:46:03.432 --> 02:46:04.872]  What's the big deal?
[02:46:04.952 --> 02:46:06.853]  None of that means anything.
[02:46:07.033 --> 02:46:07.413]  Alright.
[02:46:08.954 --> 02:46:13.415]  We're going to come back in the final segment here and I want to show you something that's happening in Sydney, Australia.
[02:46:14.651 --> 02:46:18.372]  And then a couple news stories before we conclude the Alex Jones Show.

[02:46:37.438 --> 02:46:39.939]  I don't think he wants to sign another book for the rest of his life.

[02:46:56.651 --> 02:46:57.991]  This is very serious stuff.
[02:46:59.672 --> 02:47:05.134]  Biden administration's secret weapon, Jill Biden, visits Africa.
[02:47:09.016 --> 02:47:12.317]  It's the Biden administration's secret weapon as Jill Biden is it?
[02:47:14.286 --> 02:47:15.746]  The secret weapon is Joe Biden.
[02:47:15.786 --> 02:47:16.106]  Wow.
[02:47:16.266 --> 02:47:19.527]  Well, this just... I thought that was mind-blowing.
[02:47:20.487 --> 02:47:23.608]  And then I saw a statement apparently Joe Biden made today.
[02:47:24.128 --> 02:47:25.088]  So unreal.
[02:47:25.448 --> 02:47:26.328]  I don't even believe it.
[02:47:27.248 --> 02:47:30.189]  And I'm thinking it has to be fake, but it doesn't look fake.
[02:47:30.209 --> 02:47:34.129]  I mean... But there are a bunch of fakes out there now, and so you just wonder.
[02:47:34.190 --> 02:47:38.730]  But also, Joe Biden says things like, I like kids rubbing my legs down in the pool.
[02:47:39.210 --> 02:47:40.251]  So, that's real.
[02:47:40.311 --> 02:47:40.831]  He said that.
[02:47:40.891 --> 02:47:41.931]  So, you never know with Joe.
[02:47:42.964 --> 02:47:49.388]  But a video of him talking about a nurse whispering sweet nothings into his ear.
[02:47:50.068 --> 02:47:50.708]  I'm not kidding.
[02:47:53.010 --> 02:47:54.010]  This is Joe Biden.
[02:47:54.831 --> 02:47:56.712]  This is the Democrat president.
[02:47:56.752 --> 02:48:14.557]   By the way, What's the difference between Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson and Bernie Sanders is that when Andrew Yang realized that the Democrat Party process and primary was rigged, he left and started his own party.
[02:48:14.998 --> 02:48:24.193]   Marianne Williamson and Bernie Sanders either don't realize that or They don't really want to win.
[02:48:24.233 --> 02:48:25.494]  I think that's the case with Bernie.
[02:48:25.574 --> 02:48:31.880]  I think he just wants to run, make a million dollars, buy a new lake house, and then not be president and work for four years.
[02:48:32.020 --> 02:48:33.021]  He's not a working guy.
[02:48:33.502 --> 02:48:34.242]  He doesn't work much.
[02:48:35.603 --> 02:48:36.144]  He's a bum.
[02:48:36.664 --> 02:48:39.467]  And then there's Marianne Williamson with her crystals and orbs.
[02:48:39.647 --> 02:48:41.449]  I kind of like Marianne, but...
[02:48:42.597 --> 02:48:54.062]  She's complaining because her and Bernie are getting left out of all the Democrat Party polls, and they don't get invited to the Democrat events, and they don't get treated like a good Democrat candidate should, and yeah, you don't say.
[02:48:54.962 --> 02:48:55.623]  You don't say.
[02:48:55.643 --> 02:48:58.984]  Yeah, the Democrat Party is totally rigged and corrupt, and they don't want you in there.
[02:48:59.864 --> 02:49:01.345]  Yeah, I thought you already figured that out.
[02:49:01.585 --> 02:49:02.305]  No, you didn't?
[02:49:03.226 --> 02:49:05.087]  So she's upset she's not getting recognition.
[02:49:06.187 --> 02:49:16.339]   Now, I want to play this video And we've got the pushback happening and this is what the left is not used to.
[02:49:16.419 --> 02:49:21.422]  Specifically the social justice group class type left.
[02:49:23.603 --> 02:49:30.106]  They're used to just shoving their agenda down your throat and not getting any pushback.
[02:49:30.186 --> 02:49:32.247]  Specifically with the LGBTQ stuff.
[02:49:33.528 --> 02:49:35.549]  And so now that there's pushback, they don't know what to do.
[02:49:35.929 --> 02:49:39.511]  And now when they call you a homophobe and you don't care, they don't know what to do.
[02:49:40.973 --> 02:49:46.795]  And so there's a book that's now been written by the creator of Libs of TikTok, Shia Rajchick.
[02:49:48.136 --> 02:49:59.520]  Libs of TikTok creator Shia Rajchick, who helped set off the moral panic that led to countless LGBTQ people being falsely accused of grooming kids, is publishing a book for children.
[02:49:59.540 --> 02:50:01.441]  It says, Media Matters, Ari Drennan.
[02:50:02.221 --> 02:50:02.822]  I love this.
[02:50:03.302 --> 02:50:05.203]  Falsely accused of grooming kids.
[02:50:05.663 --> 02:50:05.743]  Oh!
[02:50:07.554 --> 02:50:08.074]  You're right!
[02:50:08.554 --> 02:50:28.807]   I can't sit here and play you an hour of video with grown men pretending to be women dancing around in lingerie accepting cash tips in their underwear A San Francisco gay choir saying we're coming for your children.
[02:50:29.608 --> 02:50:31.190]  I've attended the damn events!
[02:50:32.071 --> 02:50:37.777]  Where they have grown men in leotards and tutus dancing for kids and they bring the kids up to the front of the stage!
[02:50:38.978 --> 02:50:41.421]  And they shake their junk for the kids, yeah!
[02:50:42.342 --> 02:50:42.462]  But...
[02:50:43.504 --> 02:50:46.427]  Falsely accusing, says Media Matters' Ari Drennan.
[02:50:46.867 --> 02:50:47.788]  Falsely accusing.
[02:50:47.848 --> 02:50:49.610]  It's just going on everywhere!
[02:50:49.830 --> 02:50:50.711]  And they promote it!
[02:50:51.391 --> 02:50:52.092]  As a good thing!
[02:50:52.132 --> 02:50:53.633]  And then they say, we're not doing that!
[02:50:54.054 --> 02:50:57.017]  By the way, Drag Queen Storytime at noon in the library.
[02:50:59.639 --> 02:51:00.340]  We're not doing that!
[02:51:00.360 --> 02:51:01.180]  We're not grooming kids!
[02:51:01.220 --> 02:51:01.901]  There's no evidence!
[02:51:01.921 --> 02:51:03.142]  Stop falsely accusing us!
[02:51:03.182 --> 02:51:07.486]  By the way, bring your three-year-old to Drag Queen Storytime for kids in the library tonight.
[02:51:11.249 --> 02:51:14.611]  Mrs. Kitty Litter's gonna be there.
[02:51:17.453 --> 02:51:20.976]  Fish Crotch is gonna read Snow White.
[02:51:21.756 --> 02:51:22.196]  Yeah!
[02:51:22.236 --> 02:51:23.697]  Drag Queen Fish Crotch!
[02:51:25.299 --> 02:51:26.840]  We're not grooming your kids though!
[02:51:28.301 --> 02:51:37.507]  And so now there's pushback in Sydney where they put up all these billboards in public and downtown with men in gimp outfits and a teddy bear mask.
[02:51:38.820 --> 02:52:03.427]  And they had this giant mural of rainbow wings, ladies and gentlemen, I kid you not, in public, rainbow wings made out of a assortment of male genitalia, meant for you to go stand, a kid to go stand and take a picture like it's wings, and then you've got a bunch of, you've got a bunch of dicks!
[02:52:04.408 --> 02:52:04.808]  For kids!
[02:52:07.745 --> 02:52:11.686]  And they're mad because this is the pushback, they're finally getting the pushback that they never thought they'd get.
[02:52:12.046 --> 02:52:16.987]  They thought they could call you a racist, a homophobe, a transphobe, and then never get any pushback.
[02:52:17.488 --> 02:52:22.069]  And so in Sydney, roll the clip for me guys.
[02:52:22.149 --> 02:52:29.811]  In Sydney, groups are now going out and painting over all of this propaganda, including the penis wings.
[02:52:30.831 --> 02:52:34.915]  I mean, literally, that's what they, I just, you can't even make this up.
[02:52:35.656 --> 02:52:42.722]  And so they're going around, this group is painting over it so that the kids don't get groomed by this propaganda.
[02:52:43.363 --> 02:52:46.506]  There's your teddy bear kink for kids.
[02:52:47.167 --> 02:52:49.148]  Your teddy bear gimp kink for kids.
[02:52:50.149 --> 02:52:55.615]  And there they are painting over that so the children don't have to be propagandized.
[02:52:57.148 --> 02:53:00.792]  And then there was a, they leave signs that say, leave the kids alone.
[02:53:01.433 --> 02:53:10.622]  And then there was a church, a Catholic church that had the trans gay flag and painted their stairs in the rainbow flag because they love Jesus.
[02:53:12.324 --> 02:53:13.065]  They love Jesus.
[02:53:13.786 --> 02:53:18.431]  And so they came and they painted over the rainbow flag on the steps.
[02:53:19.795 --> 02:53:22.016]  And so this is going to become the counterculture soon enough.
[02:53:22.056 --> 02:53:23.937]  Of course, InfoWars with Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:53:24.398 --> 02:53:26.038]  Conservatism is the counterculture.
[02:53:26.899 --> 02:53:29.560]  We announced that, that was like, what is that, like a decade ago?
[02:53:30.381 --> 02:53:32.722]  And so now it's finally starting to catch up.
[02:53:33.162 --> 02:53:36.484]  But they never expected this pushback and that's why they're going so crazy.
[02:53:36.864 --> 02:53:39.105]  Stop falsely accusing us of groomers!
[02:53:39.326 --> 02:53:41.787]  By the way, does your kid want to take a picture with the dick wings?
[02:53:41.606 --> 02:53:55.606]  Alright, do we have that Biden video guys?
[02:53:55.606 --> 02:53:59.867]   I don't even know if I want to play it because it just got sent to me and nowadays you gotta
[02:53:59.867 --> 02:54:04.727]   double check everything but it's Joe Biden claiming a nurse whispers sweet nothings into
[02:54:05.369 --> 02:54:06.369]  I'm not even kidding you.
[02:54:07.030 --> 02:54:07.950]  This is your president.
[02:54:08.691 --> 02:54:09.591]  What is he, 80 now?
[02:54:10.812 --> 02:54:13.574]  What kind of nurses do they have over there at his Delaware beach house?
[02:54:14.554 --> 02:54:15.475]  This is hilarious though.
[02:54:15.875 --> 02:54:21.664]   Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat, Was asked if he is still a Democrat.
[02:54:22.004 --> 02:54:24.986]  He responded by saying, I identify as an American.
[02:54:26.748 --> 02:54:29.410]  Oh, well, I guess he's not a Democrat.
[02:54:31.351 --> 02:54:31.872]  Smart move.
[02:54:33.273 --> 02:54:36.955]  Smart move to abandon the Democrat Party.
[02:54:36.996 --> 02:54:38.317]  Get off that corruption.
[02:54:39.197 --> 02:54:40.758]  That gravy train of corruption.
[02:54:41.719 --> 02:54:47.384]  That loves war and fascism and censorship and medical tyranny.
[02:54:48.263 --> 02:54:49.183]  And global government.
[02:54:50.124 --> 02:54:51.904]  Joe Manchin asked if he's still a Democrat.
[02:54:51.944 --> 02:54:53.545]  He responds by saying, I'm an American.
[02:54:53.605 --> 02:54:55.386]  Yeah, well, okay, that answers that then.
[02:54:56.026 --> 02:54:56.346]  Poll.
[02:54:56.406 --> 02:55:00.267]  Nearly 60% of voters have less money in their pockets during Biden presidency.
[02:55:00.287 --> 02:55:04.369]  According to a poll from Fox News.
[02:55:05.734 --> 02:55:11.757]  But it's the greatest economy ever, so forget your own wallet, forget your own bank account, forget your own budget, forget your own bills.
[02:55:11.978 --> 02:55:13.078]  It's the greatest economy ever, Jack.
[02:55:13.839 --> 02:55:18.061]  Billionaire investment guru Warren Buffett issues stark inflation warning.
[02:55:18.121 --> 02:55:19.982]  Fiscal deficits have consequences.
[02:55:21.283 --> 02:55:22.624]  So do recessions.
[02:55:23.284 --> 02:55:26.906]  After rate rose to 5.4% and Wall Street saw its worst week of 2023.
[02:55:27.126 --> 02:55:31.489]  You can say, oh, well, Warren Buffett is a bad guy.
[02:55:33.755 --> 02:55:34.416]  He's a bad guy.
[02:55:34.456 --> 02:55:36.677]  Well, maybe so, but he's telling you the truth.
[02:55:36.717 --> 02:55:40.280]  Yeah, he's a rich fat cat, but he's like, hey, I'm losing money in this tough economy.
[02:55:41.641 --> 02:55:44.063]  Jordan Poyer is a Buffalo Bills safety.
[02:55:44.163 --> 02:55:45.404]  One of the better safeties in the NFL.
[02:55:45.424 --> 02:55:46.364]  He's going to be a free agent.
[02:55:46.765 --> 02:55:48.826]  And he's always been an American patriot.
[02:55:48.846 --> 02:55:51.128]  He was asked about free agency.
[02:55:51.188 --> 02:55:52.669]  He plays for the Buffalo Bills in New York.
[02:55:52.709 --> 02:55:56.912]  He said, I would love a state that doesn't take half my money.
[02:55:58.273 --> 02:56:00.855]  I'd love a state that doesn't take half my money.
[02:56:00.875 --> 02:56:02.457]  What do you think?
[02:56:03.484 --> 02:56:08.648]  He ends up Miami, Tampa Bay, Jacksonville, Dallas.
[02:56:10.749 --> 02:56:14.152]  I'm guessing he's not going to end up in New York or California or Illinois.
[02:56:14.172 --> 02:56:14.772]  All right.
[02:56:14.792 --> 02:56:16.113]  Do we have the Biden video guys or?
[02:56:16.133 --> 02:56:17.915]  All right.
[02:56:18.335 --> 02:56:19.196]  This is just nuts.
[02:56:19.296 --> 02:56:23.919]  Here's Joe Biden apparently talking about a nurse whispering sweet nothings into his ear.
[02:56:23.939 --> 02:56:26.301]  Military.
[02:56:27.276 --> 02:56:31.059]  She'd come in and do things that I don't think you learn in medical school, in nursing school.
[02:56:32.219 --> 02:56:33.480]  She'd whisper in my ear.
[02:56:33.760 --> 02:56:34.901]  I couldn't understand her.
[02:56:34.921 --> 02:56:36.182]  She'd whisper and she'd lean down.
[02:56:37.103 --> 02:56:41.185]  She'd actually breathe on me to make sure that I was, that there was a connection, a human connection.
[02:56:41.986 --> 02:56:44.428]  She even went home and brought back her pillow.
[02:56:49.371 --> 02:56:50.271]  I hope that's fake.
[02:56:50.912 --> 02:56:51.732]  But I don't think it is.
[02:56:53.674 --> 02:56:56.756]  Because even the AI can't replicate a Joe Biden stutter.
[02:56:57.880 --> 02:57:02.040]   Even the AI can't properly replicate a Joe Biden fumble like that.
[02:57:02.040 --> 02:57:06.880]   All right, well, there you go, if you had Joe Biden talks about a nurse whispering
[02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:10.161]   street, nothing's in his ear on your bingo card today, you get to check that one off.
[02:57:10.161 --> 02:57:10.600]  All right.
[02:57:10.600 --> 02:57:13.399]  Christy Lee is going to be hosting the war room for me.
[02:57:13.399 --> 02:57:17.399]   I'll have a message at the beginning of the segment for the audience, but that does it

[02:58:38.656 --> 02:58:40.997]  We have redefined the discussion.
[02:58:41.297 --> 02:58:47.201]  When you go to somewhere like TPUSA now, they talk about defeating the New World Order and the globalists and the World Economic Forum and Klaus Schwab.
[02:58:47.521 --> 02:58:50.883]  That's the discussion on the conservative side of things, especially the younger side.
[02:58:51.203 --> 02:58:53.464]  That's because of InfoWars, and that's because of you.
[02:58:53.644 --> 02:58:55.105]  Going to InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:59:35.777 --> 02:59:39.860]  Yeah, I mean, it looks pretty good, but... I don't know, it's just a beard.
[02:59:39.880 --> 02:59:43.503]  It's just not that intimidating, dude.
[02:59:44.044 --> 02:59:44.444]  Hmm.
[02:59:48.047 --> 02:59:49.008]  Just a beard, huh?
[02:59:49.948 --> 02:59:57.755]  What about... I gotta go to the bathroom.
[02:59:59.875 --> 03:00:01.236]  Dude, that's intimidating, man.
