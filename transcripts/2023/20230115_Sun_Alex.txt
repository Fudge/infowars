[00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:16.976]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:18.178]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:18.559]  Today.
[00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:24.647]  It's Sunday, January 15th, 2023.
[00:00:24.647 --> 00:00:26.028]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.028 --> 00:00:29.190]  We have a very special live broadcast lined up for you tonight.
[00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.933]  Gerald Cilente, the Top Trends Forecaster, is going to be co-hosting with Owen Schroer.
[00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:39.638]  And then coming up in about two hours, the great Harrison Smith will host Sunday Night Live from 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:59.004]  Now Owen's got his own agenda of important news information to cover and I'm sure he's going to be covering it because I know I was talking to him just today and he's really excited because the CDC's had to come out and say okay the shots are linked to strokes, heart attacks, myocarditis and now they're blaming Big Pharma
[00:00:59.824 --> 00:01:04.525]  for not telling them that they'd done secret trials and knew this was going to happen.
[00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:09.866]  This is just a spectacular development as their cover-up implodes.
[00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:14.327]  And it was all of you out there spreading the word and supporting the broadcast that did this.
[00:01:14.327 --> 00:01:15.387]  So people call in.
[00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:24.108]  They say, Alex, you saved millions of lives exposing the shot and now 98% of people aren't taking it and the military isn't being forced anymore and now they're backing off on kids.
[00:01:24.108 --> 00:01:25.249]  Wow, great job, Alex.
[00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:26.129]  Great job, you!
[00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:33.242]  Great job for you in the last three years when we exposed this, supporting the show, sharing the articles, sharing the videos.
[00:01:33.242 --> 00:01:37.110]  Do you realize that our success is because of you?
[00:01:38.584 --> 00:01:40.765]  You are the reason the dog hunted.
[00:01:40.765 --> 00:01:42.965]  You're the reason this message got out.
[00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:45.206]  You're the reason that the light was turned on.
[00:01:45.206 --> 00:01:48.067]  Yeah, the light's there, but if you don't throw the switch, nobody sees it.
[00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:53.129]  So, you have saved millions of people, all of us collectively have, by the grace of God.
[00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:54.789]  And praise God for this awakening.
[00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:55.690]  Now, we're winning battles.
[00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.772]  We haven't won the war yet, but at least we're winning battles for the first time in more than 50 years against this globalist combine.
[00:02:01.772 --> 00:02:02.752]  We're identifying them.
[00:02:02.992 --> 00:02:06.236]  We're exposing them, and we're going to bring them down with God's help.
[00:02:06.236 --> 00:02:08.498]  So, tell everybody to tune in right now.
[00:02:08.498 --> 00:02:09.959]  The whole system's imploding.
[00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.464]  The world is waking up, and we're going to bring the Fauci's and Bill Gates' to justice.
[00:02:14.464 --> 00:02:18.228]  And please recommit to understand, yeah, we're winning some battles, but we've been the tip of the spear.
[00:02:18.228 --> 00:02:23.033]  We've gone through hell, and we need you to rebuild us and keep us on the front lines.
[00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:24.555]  So if you want to keep this dog in the fight,
[00:02:24.915 --> 00:02:38.120]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and get great films, great books, great supplements like The Real Red Pill and The Great Reset and The War for the World, the number one seller in the world in the first month it was out.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:46.103]  You can get it everywhere, but if you want to get a signed copy, part of the fundraiser, and exclusively have a piece of history, go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:02:46.403 --> 00:02:49.764]  And it's got us a standard markup on it because it's a fundraiser.
[00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:55.425]  Like when NPR sells a hat for $50 that cost them $10 or a t-shirt for $100 that cost them $5.
[00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.406]  You get that because you're part of the fundraiser.
[00:02:57.406 --> 00:02:59.346]  They get taxpayer money and do fundraisers.
[00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.647]  We don't get taxpayer money.
[00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:05.788]  We appeal directly to you to support us and get the book for $99.95 or get it for $20 something bucks.
[00:03:05.788 --> 00:03:07.628]  If you don't have the money, I totally understand.
[00:03:07.628 --> 00:03:09.309]  Get an unsigned copy at InfoWarshaw.com.
[00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.791]  But it has been your donations and your support with things like the book that have kept us on air.
[00:03:14.791 --> 00:03:17.553]  And we're right there on the edge of being able to stay on air.
[00:03:17.553 --> 00:03:18.973]  And it's so frustrating.
[00:03:18.973 --> 00:03:20.814]  I don't want to lay people off.
[00:03:20.814 --> 00:03:22.975]  I don't want the enemy to have victories.
[00:03:22.975 --> 00:03:27.338]  But that victory for us against the globalists of George Soros and Bill Gates is in your hands.
[00:03:27.338 --> 00:03:29.619]  You decide whether we stay on air.
[00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:34.001]  You decide whether people see articles and videos at InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:41.869]  You decide whether we're going to be victorious in this fight or not and so far you have made us win together.
[00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:53.321]  So I salute you humbly and I thank you for your past support and I encourage you to bet on the horse that keeps winning but that is exhausted and the best horse we have in the fight.
[00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:56.384]  Go now to InfoWarStore.com and get
[00:03:57.321 --> 00:04:02.083]  The Great Reset and the War for the World signed exclusively.
[00:04:02.083 --> 00:04:06.265]  There's only about a thousand left, and when they're gone, they're gone.
[00:04:06.265 --> 00:04:07.425]  It's an exclusive.
[00:04:07.425 --> 00:04:11.086]  But again, whatever you do, Owen is loaded for bear.
[00:04:11.086 --> 00:04:12.747]  Gerald Solinte is loaded for bear.
[00:04:12.747 --> 00:04:19.570]  They've got all the clips coming up with what's happening, with even CNN admitting the shot's killing people, and all these new deaths, all this craziness.
[00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:28.415]  But no one is going to see the past analysis and who's really behind it and what the globals are planning next if you don't share this feed.
[00:04:28.415 --> 00:04:30.717]  Because we're not just tooting our horn that we were right about the past.
[00:04:30.717 --> 00:04:34.239]  Now we're about to tell you what's going to go down in the future if we don't stop them.
[00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:35.620]  This is do or die.
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.041]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:42.325]  Now go to infowarestore.com right now and get The Great Reset and the War for the World signed.
[00:04:42.325 --> 00:04:46.748]  And I thank you so much from the bottom of my heart for keeping my crew and myself in the fight.
[00:04:46.748 --> 00:04:49.329]  We'll be right back with Owen Schroeder, Gerald Cilente,
[00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.731]  Harrison Smith and more.
[00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:52.152]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.981 --> 00:05:05.723]  The second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[00:05:05.723 --> 00:05:10.905]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[00:05:10.905 --> 00:05:15.768]  And Infowars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[00:05:15.768 --> 00:05:20.710]  Now, in the last year, we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:29.754]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission and you get a historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[00:05:30.214 --> 00:05:43.227]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt, Man of the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now while supplies last at 1776coin.com.
[00:05:43.227 --> 00:05:47.010]  And just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt or a DVD,
[00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:49.172]  300%.
[00:05:49.172 --> 00:05:51.713]  That's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[00:05:51.713 --> 00:05:56.135]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at $17.76 on what coins remain.
[00:05:56.135 --> 00:05:58.016]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:16.053]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:16.053 --> 00:06:17.754]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:17.754 --> 00:06:19.416]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:19.416 --> 00:06:24.120]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:27.404 --> 00:06:35.006]  It was early 2022, about a year ago, that the dam broke pertaining to the cover-up of what COVID vaccines are really doing.
[00:06:35.006 --> 00:06:49.310]  But now in the last four days, the CDC has come out, the NIH has come out, the FDA boards have come out, and all pointed fingers at each other saying they were lied to about secret studies that were done on the experimental shots.
[00:06:49.950 --> 00:07:00.034]  Studies that were done once the injections began, but now the CDC is releasing documents confirming massive increases in blood clots, myocarditis, heart attacks, infertility, strokes, you name it.
[00:07:00.034 --> 00:07:12.040]  And then today, Fox News, we're about to play the clip, comes out and says, whoa, the CDC says it got covered up what happened with strokes increasing and they're so upset they didn't know.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.681]  This is rats leaving the sinking ship.
[00:07:15.541 --> 00:07:18.786]  This is the establishment that did this on purpose being caught.
[00:07:18.786 --> 00:07:24.255]  If you go back to 2014-15, Obama funded the University of Texas, Galveston.
[00:07:24.255 --> 00:07:24.896]  My studies...
[00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:37.903]  And they found, with a similar coronavirus mRNA vaccine, that it was causing massive heart attacks, blood clots in the lungs, myocarditis, and the rats lived about half as long as rats normally do.
[00:07:37.903 --> 00:07:45.646]  Ladies and gentlemen, they knew what they were doing, as Dr. Michael Yedon, the former Chief Scientist and Vice President of Pfizer, said a week ago.
[00:07:45.646 --> 00:07:46.827]  They knew it was toxic.
[00:07:46.827 --> 00:07:48.607]  They knew it was a depopulation weapon.
[00:07:48.607 --> 00:07:50.328]  So here's the clip from Fox News.
[00:07:50.948 --> 00:07:54.670]  The bad news is millions have died, hundreds of millions are sick.
[00:07:54.670 --> 00:08:00.372]  The good news is less than 10% of people are taking these shots compared to what were just a year ago.
[00:08:00.372 --> 00:08:07.955]  So the public's waking up, but now we've got to bring Big Pharma and these mad scientists led by Fauci and Bill Gates and Peter Daszak to justice.
[00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:12.457]  This was premeditated, just like I told you three years ago when this all started.
[00:08:12.457 --> 00:08:19.160]  But remember, back in 1976, only three people died from the swine flu vaccine and they suspended the whole program.
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.583]  We know hundreds and hundreds of thousands conservatively have died in the U.S.
[00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:24.183]  alone.
[00:08:24.183 --> 00:08:27.726]  All the documents are posted at InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[00:08:27.726 --> 00:08:34.471]  All of you that told the truth, all the doctors and scientists that spoke out, all of us as independent journalists that told the truth, we are vindicated.
[00:08:34.471 --> 00:08:36.212]  But it's not about being vindicated.
[00:08:36.212 --> 00:08:38.714]  It's about bringing the criminals to justice to protect the innocent.
[00:08:38.714 --> 00:08:44.478]  Because now they're coming after not just six-month-old and up, they're coming after newborn babies and pregnant women.
[00:08:44.478 --> 00:08:45.039]  Here's the report.
[00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:47.461]  So we are just getting word of this now.
[00:08:47.461 --> 00:09:01.153]  Regarding the COVID vaccine, the CDC is now saying there has been enough cases of people who have had the vaccine, received the vaccine, and then suffered a stroke.
[00:09:01.153 --> 00:09:08.800]  The agency will now be investigating any potential links between the shots and strokes in some of those patients.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.882]  The globalist criminals are on the run.
[00:09:10.882 --> 00:09:11.963]  We're really starting to win.
[00:09:12.803 --> 00:09:14.244]  But we've only won major battles.
[00:09:14.244 --> 00:09:15.744]  We haven't won the war.
[00:09:15.744 --> 00:09:17.285]  That's why Info Wars is so important.
[00:09:17.285 --> 00:09:18.226]  It's why it's the tip of the spear.
[00:09:18.226 --> 00:09:20.987]  It's why those that launch this attack are so scared.
[00:09:20.987 --> 00:09:23.828]  There's not just my Sunday show coming up tomorrow 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:09:23.828 --> 00:09:25.629]  with key guests analysis.
[00:09:25.629 --> 00:09:27.510]  Not just my weekday show from 11 a.m.
[00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.050]  to 3 p.m.
[00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:28.310]  Central.
[00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:33.494]  But on Tuesday we're doing an Alex Jones was right marathon broadcast from 8 a.m.
[00:09:33.494 --> 00:09:37.518]  past midnight with top scientists and experts across the board.
[00:09:37.518 --> 00:09:39.920]  Looks like we've got Michael Yeadon coming on as well.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.363]  So be sure to join us this coming Tuesday at 8 a.m.
[00:09:43.363 --> 00:09:45.825]  for the kickoff of this marathon broadcast.
[00:09:45.825 --> 00:09:47.286]  We're going to save a lot of lives.
[00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:52.531]  We're going to move the goal one step closer to bringing the new world order to justice.
[00:10:03.248 --> 00:10:05.610]  What if you had the plans to the Death Star?
[00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.892]  What if you knew the globalist operations that could stop it?
[00:10:08.892 --> 00:10:10.433]  Well, we've done the research.
[00:10:10.433 --> 00:10:15.156]  We have the number one best-selling book in the country, not just in politics, but period.
[00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.877]  It's the Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:10:16.877 --> 00:10:19.059]  And you get a signed copy of this, the last 1,400.
[00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:21.500]  Keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.421]  Please take action.
[00:10:22.421 --> 00:10:24.562]  I want to thank you all for your past support.
[00:10:24.562 --> 00:10:29.926]  Get one of these signed copies and know you kept InfoWars on the air at the most critical juncture in our history.
[00:10:30.246 --> 00:10:32.228]  Again, 2023 is here.
[00:10:32.228 --> 00:10:34.210]  The last run of signed copies of the book.
[00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.212]  We also have unsigned copies as well.
[00:10:36.212 --> 00:10:38.694]  The signed copies are limited and are about to run out.
[00:10:38.694 --> 00:10:40.276]  Thank you for your support.
[00:10:40.276 --> 00:10:43.119]  Again, get yours at info or store.com.
[00:10:51.522 --> 00:10:59.428]  Thank you, Alex, and we are now live inside InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:10:59.428 --> 00:11:06.214]  Owen Schroer here with you hosting the Alex Jones Show the rest of the way, joined by Gerald Salente as well.
[00:11:06.214 --> 00:11:11.077]  He's over there in New York like a busy beaver going through all of his documents.
[00:11:11.077 --> 00:11:14.760]  I've got all my documents laid out here in front of me as well.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.322]  Before I bring Gerald in, though, I just want to get one thing.
[00:11:18.487 --> 00:11:43.439]  off my chest if you will before we get started here that was I want to reiterate that was already stated by Alex Jones I can't express my gratitude to this audience enough and I really hope you understand as Alex has tried to explain many times without you we don't exist and in case you haven't noticed and I don't want to make a big thing of this tonight but in case you haven't noticed
[00:11:44.119 --> 00:11:48.403]  A lot of people are getting their Twitter accounts back, but you've noticed who's not by now, haven't you?
[00:11:48.403 --> 00:11:50.786]  You've noticed who's not allowed to go back on Twitter.
[00:11:50.786 --> 00:11:55.711]  It's Alex Jones and it's his great crew, myself included, Harrison Smith and others.
[00:11:55.711 --> 00:11:59.675]  So, we are the most censored network in the world.
[00:11:59.675 --> 00:12:01.416]  We are the most censored individuals.
[00:12:02.037 --> 00:12:02.317]  Thank you.
[00:12:17.913 --> 00:12:34.138]  And so I am eternally grateful for this audience, and I am eternally grateful for everything you've done to make InfoWars successful, to keep us on the air despite all the attacks against us, so that we can come in here every day and do a great job trying to inform the world.
[00:12:34.138 --> 00:12:37.879]  And as people have started to notice, you know, we don't claim
[00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:55.241]  to be saving lives here like that's what our duty is every day but it is a fact we've probably saved hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives when it comes to this vaccine and that's just by telling the truth that's not even like we have to come out here and think how can we save lives they're telling you
[00:12:55.882 --> 00:13:01.506]  A COVID-19 poison injection is safe and effective when we knew the opposite was true.
[00:13:01.506 --> 00:13:03.928]  So that's all it was, was just getting out the information.
[00:13:03.928 --> 00:13:07.051]  Wouldn't you like to know before you bite into that apple if it's poisoned?
[00:13:07.051 --> 00:13:09.473]  We're just here telling you that's a poisoned apple.
[00:13:09.473 --> 00:13:10.694]  You might not want to bite into it.
[00:13:10.694 --> 00:13:11.875]  So, once again...
[00:13:12.575 --> 00:13:13.976]  Eternally grateful for you.
[00:13:13.976 --> 00:13:15.877]  Don't take InfoWars for granted.
[00:13:15.877 --> 00:13:20.781]  You want to continue to see us on the air every day, shop at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:13:20.781 --> 00:13:30.548]  And the great guests, one of which who's been joining us for a long time, from the Trends Journal, the story before it happens, Gerald Salente.
[00:13:30.548 --> 00:13:32.649]  Gerald, I got a bunch of stuff for us to go over today.
[00:13:32.649 --> 00:13:36.412]  Big Stacks News, I see you're shuffling through your documents as well.
[00:13:36.412 --> 00:13:38.313]  What's your big story for this evening, Gerald Salente?
[00:13:39.451 --> 00:13:48.537]  Well, you know, I'm listening to what you're saying and about how important it is for the people to do everything they can to support InfoWars.
[00:13:48.537 --> 00:13:59.283]  Because all they're doing is selling us a daily diet of useless news and total propaganda.
[00:13:59.283 --> 00:14:05.127]  On the useless news front, do I care that a football player after he got tackled got a heart attack?
[00:14:05.916 --> 00:14:07.257]  I mean, that's part of the game.
[00:14:07.257 --> 00:14:08.338]  Oh, did he get a vaccine?
[00:14:08.338 --> 00:14:10.239]  I don't care.
[00:14:10.239 --> 00:14:18.184]  This is not essential news that's going to help me as a human being prepare, prevail, and prosper in the future.
[00:14:18.184 --> 00:14:20.606]  I want information that's going to help me.
[00:14:20.606 --> 00:14:22.947]  I'm not in the sixth grade.
[00:14:22.947 --> 00:14:24.868]  Elvis Presley's daughter died.
[00:14:24.868 --> 00:14:31.252]  I've been watching her every day, all my life, since I remember Elvis Presley.
[00:14:31.252 --> 00:14:32.293]  This is not news.
[00:14:32.293 --> 00:14:33.774]  This is entertainment.
[00:14:33.854 --> 00:14:39.435]  But wait a second, Gerald, you're telling me that two years of Rachel Maddow talking about Trump-Russia collusion was a waste of time?
[00:14:39.435 --> 00:14:45.697]  I mean, for two years, this woman was telling you.
[00:14:45.697 --> 00:14:48.458]  That goes back to the second thing I said.
[00:14:48.458 --> 00:14:50.258]  The propaganda.
[00:14:50.258 --> 00:14:57.460]  So they feed you with useless garbage, and then they brain dead you with propaganda.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.700]  I'm going to give you an example.
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.981]  This is from the Financial Times.
[00:15:03.632 --> 00:15:05.273]  Not ancient history.
[00:15:05.273 --> 00:15:07.055]  January 10th.
[00:15:07.055 --> 00:15:13.860]  Russia's set for rare success with control of key town.
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.461]  Rare success?
[00:15:15.461 --> 00:15:17.282]  Hey, got some.
[00:15:17.282 --> 00:15:20.565]  They got 20% of the country or more.
[00:15:20.565 --> 00:15:32.454]  They destroyed some 70% of the power and infrastructure and water infrastructure of the country.
[00:15:33.661 --> 00:15:34.902]  So what am I, six years old?
[00:15:34.902 --> 00:15:36.123]  Who are you talking to?
[00:15:36.123 --> 00:15:38.784]  We're talking to the general public.
[00:15:38.784 --> 00:15:41.646]  We feed them crap, they swallow crap.
[00:15:41.646 --> 00:15:48.170]  They eat junk news, they swallow junk food, and they listen to junkheads.
[00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:53.714]  And that's why I'm saying the people have to do all they can to support InfoWars.
[00:15:53.714 --> 00:15:55.215]  We're in the time of our life.
[00:16:09.338 --> 00:16:11.719]  What if you had the plans to the Death Star?
[00:16:11.719 --> 00:16:15.001]  What if you knew the globalist operations that could stop it?
[00:16:15.001 --> 00:16:16.502]  Well, we've done the research.
[00:16:16.502 --> 00:16:19.144]  We have the number one best-selling book in the country.
[00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:21.245]  Not just in politics, but period.
[00:16:21.245 --> 00:16:23.046]  It's the Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:16:23.046 --> 00:16:26.108]  You get a signed copy of this, the last 1,400.
[00:16:26.108 --> 00:16:27.609]  Keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:16:27.609 --> 00:16:28.529]  Please take action.
[00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:30.670]  I want to thank you all for your past support.
[00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:36.354]  Get one of these signed copies and know you kept InfoWars on the air at the most critical juncture in our history.
[00:16:36.354 --> 00:16:36.614]  Again,
[00:16:37.394 --> 00:16:40.296]  2023 is here, the last run of signed copies of the book.
[00:16:40.296 --> 00:16:42.278]  We also have unsigned copies as well.
[00:16:42.278 --> 00:16:44.679]  The signed copies are limited and are about to run out.
[00:16:44.679 --> 00:16:46.360]  Thank you for your support.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.343]  Again, get yours at info or store.com.
[00:16:59.574 --> 00:17:04.118]  I'm taking a lot of supplements over the years, since high school, and they had great effects.
[00:17:04.118 --> 00:17:07.821]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:18.650]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with, the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.012]  These products work great for women as well.
[00:17:20.612 --> 00:17:23.013]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[00:17:23.013 --> 00:17:25.493]  It's a number one national bestseller under another name.
[00:17:25.493 --> 00:17:31.295]  We got it discounted for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com under the label InfoWars Platinum.
[00:17:31.295 --> 00:17:33.555]  We've also got HGH Max Boost.
[00:17:33.555 --> 00:17:34.856]  Read all about it.
[00:17:34.856 --> 00:17:36.216]  Be very safe with it.
[00:17:36.216 --> 00:17:39.637]  I'd take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[00:17:39.637 --> 00:17:41.157]  Don't do it during the day.
[00:17:41.157 --> 00:17:44.178]  1776 testosterone boost.
[00:17:44.178 --> 00:17:45.238]  Totally incredible.
[00:17:45.238 --> 00:17:46.179]  Go read about them.
[00:17:46.179 --> 00:17:46.959]  Learn more about them.
[00:17:47.259 --> 00:17:52.544]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago
[00:18:08.331 --> 00:18:11.876]  Rumors of his demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[00:18:11.876 --> 00:18:15.881]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[00:18:15.881 --> 00:18:18.204]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[00:18:18.204 --> 00:18:22.610]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support.
[00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.073]  Because the facts that we've covered is coming true.
[00:18:25.754 --> 00:18:34.584]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[00:18:34.584 --> 00:18:40.271]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[00:18:40.751 --> 00:18:42.713]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[00:18:42.713 --> 00:18:49.978]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[00:18:49.978 --> 00:18:51.379]  It is all in your hands.
[00:18:51.379 --> 00:18:52.720]  So thanks for your support.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.941]  Stand up against the globalists.
[00:18:53.941 --> 00:18:57.203]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and keep us on air.
[00:18:57.203 --> 00:18:57.684]  It's up to you.
[00:19:00.307 --> 00:19:03.428]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:19:03.428 --> 00:19:05.729]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:09.670]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:18.593]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:19:18.593 --> 00:19:26.395]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:19:27.418 --> 00:19:30.299]  So for myself, the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:19:30.299 --> 00:19:36.842]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:39.883]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:19:39.883 --> 00:19:46.926]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[00:19:46.926 --> 00:19:48.107]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[00:19:48.847 --> 00:19:53.111]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at M4Store.com.
[00:19:53.111 --> 00:19:58.075]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to M4Store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:19:58.075 --> 00:20:01.679]  Please take action now.
[00:20:01.679 --> 00:20:07.564]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:23.424 --> 00:20:28.325]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:20:28.325 --> 00:20:30.386]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:30.386 --> 00:20:33.567]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:20:33.567 --> 00:20:35.787]  With the great Gerald Salente.
[00:20:35.787 --> 00:20:37.708]  Now, I've got all these video clips.
[00:20:37.708 --> 00:20:41.489]  We're going to get into the COVID news, vaccine news here.
[00:20:41.489 --> 00:20:42.929]  I got all these video clips.
[00:20:42.929 --> 00:20:44.270]  Let me just tell you what we have.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:51.163]  We've got a girl being held down against her will to take this vaccine, screaming and crying, held down.
[00:20:51.163 --> 00:20:55.246]  It's like a scene out of a psycho killer film.
[00:20:55.246 --> 00:21:03.731]  We've got new documents revealed that the entire pandemic, the creation of the virus, the lockdown, everything, was a Department of Defense operation.
[00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:06.593]  The vaccine was released as part of countermeasures.
[00:21:06.593 --> 00:21:09.935]  These documents revealed via a Freedom of Information Act request.
[00:21:11.263 --> 00:21:17.008]  Ernest Ramirez, 16-year-old son, dies five days after receiving Pfizer COVID vaccine.
[00:21:17.008 --> 00:21:21.552]  Moderna conveniently announces their new mRNA heart failure therapy.
[00:21:21.552 --> 00:21:22.132]  Oh!
[00:21:22.132 --> 00:21:28.678]  So they give you a little vaccine that stops your heart, then they tell you they've got the nice solution for the heart that they just stopped.
[00:21:28.678 --> 00:21:32.441]  That's called the Pied Piper.
[00:21:32.441 --> 00:21:33.963]  And it just goes on and on with this.
[00:21:33.963 --> 00:21:34.944]  Then there's the headlines.
[00:21:36.451 --> 00:21:41.154]  BBC studio windows covered in stickers symbolizing deaths caused by COVID jabs.
[00:21:41.154 --> 00:21:43.135]  Oh, they don't like that, that vaccine they promoted.
[00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:49.179]  They told you safe and effective, now so many dead from it.
[00:21:49.179 --> 00:21:52.380]  Dating show for the unvaxxed removed from YouTube.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:59.385]  Yeah, people that didn't get the vaccine, the purebloods as they're called, are, you know, maybe not so willing to...
[00:22:00.666 --> 00:22:05.912]  Mix, let's say, or procreate, or have sexual relations with vaccinated people.
[00:22:05.912 --> 00:22:06.713]  Is that so wrong?
[00:22:06.713 --> 00:22:08.295]  Well, apparently, according to YouTube, it is.
[00:22:10.165 --> 00:22:11.346]  Then you've got a plane crash.
[00:22:11.346 --> 00:22:12.646]  At least 68 dead in Nepal.
[00:22:12.646 --> 00:22:14.807]  Plane crash after aircraft plummets into gorge.
[00:22:14.807 --> 00:22:19.389]  Now, we've seen an increase in plane crashes after the COVID-19 vaccine.
[00:22:19.389 --> 00:22:20.390]  Well, why would that be?
[00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:21.811]  Well, maybe the elite have an idea.
[00:22:21.811 --> 00:22:26.873]  Wealthy elite now requiring an unvaccinated crew to fly their jets, according to a pilot.
[00:22:26.873 --> 00:22:34.317]  So, the elite know that if your pilot has been vaccinated, that's an increase of a stroke, a heart attack, other such problems.
[00:22:34.317 --> 00:22:38.119]  They don't want the pilots, vaccinated pilots, flying their planes.
[00:22:39.497 --> 00:22:43.220]  CNN and Washbowl COVID expert claims number of pandemic deaths have been overcounted.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.082]  That's Dr. Wu.
[00:22:46.082 --> 00:22:52.827]  Now, you may remember her, and we bring in Gerald Cilenti here.
[00:22:52.827 --> 00:22:54.228]  Dr. Lena Nguyen here.
[00:22:54.228 --> 00:22:54.728]  That was her name.
[00:22:54.728 --> 00:22:55.609]  Dr. Lena Nguyen.
[00:22:57.045 --> 00:23:03.507]  ...was saying the most outrageous stuff, of course, on CNN, even outrageous for CNN standards.
[00:23:03.507 --> 00:23:12.170]  Now she's basically backtracking on everything, saying, well, the numbers of the viruses was overcounted, it was exaggerated, the masks never worked, it looks like the vaccines don't work.
[00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:16.152]  If you're CNN, how do you not feel like a complete idiot?
[00:23:16.152 --> 00:23:28.160]  I mean, this woman either completely fooled you, or she's like a spy or something that just went on your network and spouted off propaganda for two whole years and is now embarrassing you saying it was all fake.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.001]  But aside from that...
[00:23:30.131 --> 00:23:33.573]  When do the trials begin, Gerald Cilente, to all these people?
[00:24:01.051 --> 00:24:03.232]  No, they're not going to have a trial.
[00:24:03.232 --> 00:24:06.373]  They can lie and do anything that they want.
[00:24:06.373 --> 00:24:14.535]  How about that little daddy's boy born on third base with a pair of cojones smaller than a mothball, George W. Bush?
[00:24:14.535 --> 00:24:24.478]  And I can't call the other guy Dick Cheney because I don't want to get censored here, so I'll call him Penis Cheney, who lied us into the Iraq War.
[00:24:24.478 --> 00:24:29.100]  I had a rally here on July 23rd up in Kingston.
[00:24:29.847 --> 00:24:31.787]  Here it is.
[00:24:31.787 --> 00:24:33.648]  Peace and freedom.
[00:24:33.648 --> 00:24:44.430]  My speakers are Judge Andrew Napolitano, Gary Null, Scott Ritter, and Phil Giraldi.
[00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:50.151]  Phil Giraldi was a top, top CIA guy.
[00:24:50.151 --> 00:24:55.191]  Goes into little Georgie Bush's office with the facts.
[00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:58.312]  There are no weapons of mass destruction in
[00:24:59.437 --> 00:25:00.637]  Iraq.
[00:25:00.637 --> 00:25:02.458]  You know what Bushy did?
[00:25:02.458 --> 00:25:04.758]  He told Phil Giroldi, get out of here.
[00:25:04.758 --> 00:25:06.459]  Get out of the office.
[00:25:06.459 --> 00:25:08.219]  You know what Phil Giroldi did?
[00:25:08.219 --> 00:25:09.119]  He quit.
[00:25:09.119 --> 00:25:10.720]  He's a real man of honor.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:18.142]  How come these warmongering little lying freaks haven't been brought up on trial?
[00:25:18.142 --> 00:25:20.802]  You think this is going to bring these people up on trial?
[00:25:20.802 --> 00:25:22.303]  No way.
[00:25:22.303 --> 00:25:24.403]  It's one big club and you ain't in it.
[00:25:24.403 --> 00:25:27.844]  And the club is nothing more than a crime syndicate.
[00:25:28.573 --> 00:25:34.035]  The country is run by the military-industrial complex, as we're seeing now.
[00:25:34.035 --> 00:25:39.277]  Anybody with a brain bigger than a pea can't see it.
[00:25:39.277 --> 00:25:40.917]  You're dumb and blind.
[00:25:40.917 --> 00:25:43.818]  Who is the Secretary of Defense?
[00:25:43.818 --> 00:25:45.559]  Oh, Lloyd Austin.
[00:25:45.559 --> 00:25:50.301]  I was a general in Iraq and killed a lot of innocent people.
[00:25:50.301 --> 00:25:57.123]  And before I got the job as Secretary of Defense, I sat on the board of directors of Raytheon.
[00:25:58.638 --> 00:26:01.820]  You've got the military-industrial complex.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:11.246]  Oh, and believe me, believe a man by the name of Dwight D. Eisenhower, five-star general, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces.
[00:26:11.246 --> 00:26:26.475]  Oh, the celebration, January 17th, his farewell address, 1963, warning the American people that the military-industrial complex is robbing the nation of the genius of the scientists, the sweat of the laborers, and the future of the children.
[00:26:26.955 --> 00:26:28.135]  Here we are.
[00:26:28.135 --> 00:26:28.856]  Here we are.
[00:26:28.856 --> 00:26:33.117]  Hundred and eight hundred and sixty billion dollar defense budget.
[00:26:33.117 --> 00:26:33.757]  Oh, yeah.
[00:26:33.757 --> 00:26:38.798]  Anyway, the military industrial complex and the banksters.
[00:26:38.798 --> 00:26:40.379]  Oh, that's right.
[00:26:40.379 --> 00:26:42.700]  Hey, I'm too big to fail.
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:43.720]  You're a nobody.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.340]  I'm Jamie Dimon.
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.501]  I'm Goldman Sachs.
[00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:47.721]  I'm a Merrill Lynch mob.
[00:26:48.419 --> 00:26:52.243]  Oh, the Federal Reserve going to dump in 29 trillion dollars, right?
[00:26:52.243 --> 00:26:55.005]  Oh, yeah, that's okay.
[00:26:55.005 --> 00:27:00.611]  2007, 2010, according to the Bard College, Levy Institute at Bard College.
[00:27:00.611 --> 00:27:05.375]  And the same thing, as the markets are going down, the Federal Reserve just kept pumping in more and more money.
[00:27:05.375 --> 00:27:12.963]  Number three, the drug dealers, that morons and imbeciles call Big Pharma.
[00:27:15.003 --> 00:27:20.118]  That little low-life piece of garbage scum crap, Bill Clinton.
[00:27:21.534 --> 00:27:31.516]  Every time the guy who every time he got caught wearing his pants down bombs the way over Baghdad, he killed over 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five, those dirty Russians.
[00:27:31.516 --> 00:27:42.679]  No, no, Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright on 60 Minutes telling Leslie Stahl, the sanctions put on Russia that killed 500,000 Iraqi children, it was worth the price.
[00:27:42.679 --> 00:27:48.900]  That Bill Clinton allowed the drug dealers to run their ads on TV in 1997.
[00:27:51.992 --> 00:27:56.216]  Number four, big tech.
[00:27:56.216 --> 00:27:58.419]  That's who controls this country.
[00:27:58.419 --> 00:28:02.002]  The geeks, the big King James Bible got it wrong.
[00:28:02.002 --> 00:28:04.345]  They say the meek shall inherit the earth.
[00:28:05.194 --> 00:28:07.895]  The geeks have inherited the earth.
[00:28:07.895 --> 00:28:11.836]  We are run and controlled by little nothings.
[00:28:11.836 --> 00:28:13.277]  Little nothings.
[00:28:13.277 --> 00:28:18.178]  Boys and girls, and you call them out man to man, they go down.
[00:28:18.178 --> 00:28:26.681]  Little nothings, but really arrogant when they got their security guards around them and tell you how to live and run your life.
[00:28:26.681 --> 00:28:30.862]  So no, they're not going to do anything with the gangsters that did this to
[00:28:32.003 --> 00:28:33.704]  That started the COVID war.
[00:28:33.704 --> 00:28:37.106]  Go back to our Trends Journal magazine.
[00:28:37.106 --> 00:28:43.550]  January 28th, 2020.
[00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.271]  China launches the COVID war.
[00:28:45.271 --> 00:28:47.692]  106 dead in China.
[00:28:47.692 --> 00:28:52.375]  Our next line was 1.4 billion still alive.
[00:28:52.375 --> 00:28:54.496]  Why are you telling me this?
[00:28:54.496 --> 00:28:55.437]  That's Gerald Cilenti.
[00:28:55.437 --> 00:28:56.938]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:59.505 --> 00:29:14.715]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is your last chance to get a historic signed copy of my number one best-selling book, The Great Reset and The War for the World, exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:14.715 --> 00:29:26.923]  Yes, you can get the book in stores, you can find it online, but if you want to get a historic signed copy and be part of our fundraiser to stay on air, go to InfoWarsTore.com and go to the book section and get your signed book.
[00:29:27.563 --> 00:29:31.866]  There are only about a thousand of these left, and when they're gone, they're gone.
[00:29:31.866 --> 00:29:35.388]  I'm never going to sign the book again.
[00:29:35.388 --> 00:29:37.390]  We have a little limited edition thing coming out later.
[00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:41.112]  There's a piece of art that goes with the book, but I haven't even decided when I'm going to do that.
[00:29:41.112 --> 00:29:42.173]  It may never happen.
[00:29:42.173 --> 00:29:51.580]  But for just simple, straight-up signed books, and to be part of this fundraiser, this is the last time you'll be able to get a signed book at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:53.183]  I thank you all for your support.
[00:29:53.183 --> 00:29:56.389]  Please go to InfoWarriorTour.com and get your signed book today.
[00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:58.995]  And I thank you for keeping us in the fight against the globalists.
[00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:05.535]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[00:30:05.535 --> 00:30:11.960]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:17.083]  We are engaging the globalists at Point Lake Range in the information war.
[00:30:17.083 --> 00:30:18.764]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[00:30:18.764 --> 00:30:25.209]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we've had this success.
[00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:31.350]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:35.671]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[00:30:35.671 --> 00:30:44.893]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[00:30:44.893 --> 00:30:46.253]  God bless you all.
[00:30:46.253 --> 00:30:47.294]  I salute you.
[00:30:47.294 --> 00:30:48.374]  I thank you.
[00:30:48.374 --> 00:30:53.735]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[00:30:54.416 --> 00:30:55.744]  The fight is my fight.
[00:30:55.744 --> 00:30:56.367]  It's your fight.
[00:30:56.367 --> 00:30:57.111]  It's our fight.
[00:30:57.111 --> 00:30:57.915]  God bless you all.
[00:30:59.107 --> 00:31:06.689]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, even though they may seem little, have a massive ripple effect throughout time and space.
[00:31:06.689 --> 00:31:08.290]  We're actually winning the Info Award.
[00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:18.473]  And when you realize that Bandot Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors and investigative journalists and talk show hosts whose information is beyond incredible.
[00:31:18.473 --> 00:31:24.175]  Hundreds of medical doctors and scientists, all of them, right now, telling the truth at Bandot Video.
[00:31:24.175 --> 00:31:26.396]  Millions of people a day visiting Bandot Video.
[00:31:26.736 --> 00:31:36.322]  But you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect, and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors, and perfect strangers.
[00:31:36.322 --> 00:31:38.883]  You are the modern Paul Reveres.
[00:31:38.883 --> 00:31:42.045]  You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[00:31:42.045 --> 00:31:47.288]  When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[00:31:47.288 --> 00:31:54.713]  So I thank you all for your past action, and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now, because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[00:31:59.773 --> 00:32:01.955]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:32:01.955 --> 00:32:03.756]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[00:32:03.756 --> 00:32:05.818]  This is an information war.
[00:32:05.818 --> 00:32:10.522]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[00:32:10.522 --> 00:32:17.007]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[00:32:17.447 --> 00:32:18.208]  We're good to go.
[00:32:39.005 --> 00:32:46.947]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[00:32:46.947 --> 00:32:49.268]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[00:32:49.268 --> 00:32:51.088]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[00:32:51.088 --> 00:32:52.228]  We're going over the top.
[00:32:52.228 --> 00:32:53.749]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[00:32:53.749 --> 00:32:56.869]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now!
[00:32:56.869 --> 00:32:57.450]  Donate now!
[00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:57.830]  Donate now!
[00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:58.390]  Donate now!
[00:32:58.390 --> 00:32:58.850]  Donate now!
[00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:01.030]  Donate now!
[00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:06.912]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:11.655 --> 00:33:18.498]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:18.498 --> 00:33:31.524]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:31.524 --> 00:33:34.045]  Still here, every day, on air, despite
[00:33:36.724 --> 00:33:40.387]  The dreams of Hillary Clinton to have us shut down.
[00:33:40.387 --> 00:33:45.191]  The dreams of George Soros and Klaus Schwab and the Chinese Communists.
[00:33:45.191 --> 00:33:48.433]  Their wet dreams of InfoWars being off air.
[00:33:48.433 --> 00:33:50.735]  We're still here.
[00:33:50.735 --> 00:33:52.056]  And we're thankful for it.
[00:33:52.056 --> 00:33:53.737]  The world is thankful for it.
[00:33:53.737 --> 00:33:56.239]  And it's all because of your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:33:56.239 --> 00:34:00.342]  Your prayers, your words of encouragement, sharing, spreading the links is always key as well.
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.802]  That's one of the greatest things, when somebody says, hey, I'm a new listener.
[00:34:04.802 --> 00:34:10.085]  I just found you guys in the last month, or the last couple of months, after you had been censored.
[00:34:10.085 --> 00:34:11.126]  It's great to have found you.
[00:34:11.126 --> 00:34:15.028]  I feel like somebody's finally speaking the truth.
[00:34:15.028 --> 00:34:16.829]  Somebody's finally speaking reality.
[00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:18.410]  I just don't get it anywhere.
[00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:23.553]  So remember to spread the links, but always shop at Infowarsstore.com, the great supplements.
[00:34:23.553 --> 00:34:26.655]  Unfortunately, we have just sold out of Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:34:34.779 --> 00:34:37.341]  So I was wondering, we were told we were actually going to get another shipment.
[00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:38.522]  So this is now back in stock.
[00:34:38.522 --> 00:34:40.964]  So good news, we sold out and it's already back in stock.

[00:35:08.765 --> 00:35:10.906]  Gerald Salenti with us.
[00:35:10.906 --> 00:35:17.430]  And Gerald, of course, next week is Davos over there in Switzerland.
[00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:22.873]  All the wealthy, the club as you like to call them, the club is meeting in Davos.
[00:35:22.873 --> 00:35:24.995]  And you know, they hate the people so much.
[00:35:24.995 --> 00:35:30.398]  They hate the peasants and the serfs so much, Gerald, that they've set up a security perimeter that's about
[00:35:30.598 --> 00:35:31.118]  You're right.
[00:35:31.118 --> 00:35:33.300]  I call us plantation workers of slavelandia.
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.982]  When I was a young guy, there were grocery stores, hardware stores, stationery stores.
[00:36:01.061 --> 00:36:04.663]  You know, drug stores, and now they're all chains.
[00:36:04.663 --> 00:36:05.483]  They own everything.
[00:36:05.483 --> 00:36:06.783]  And I have to correct you.
[00:36:06.783 --> 00:36:13.406]  You said about Soros, Schwab, and Hillary Clinton having wet dreams.
[00:36:13.406 --> 00:36:14.587]  They're all dried up, man.
[00:36:14.587 --> 00:36:22.250]  They don't have wet dreams anymore.
[00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:28.492]  The other thing, too, I want to mention really briefly, to bring it into the context of listening to the 1776 coin.
[00:36:30.658 --> 00:36:33.319]  The silver coin, why this is so important.
[00:36:33.319 --> 00:36:39.702]  You know, we had forecast, by the way, back in November, October, that gold prices had bottomed.
[00:36:39.702 --> 00:36:43.503]  And that gold and silver prices were going to go up from that point.
[00:36:43.503 --> 00:36:44.964]  And they have.
[00:36:44.964 --> 00:36:49.786]  And now you're seeing gold now, you know, above 1900 an ounce.
[00:36:49.786 --> 00:36:55.608]  So I'm not telling people what to do, what to invest in, but I'm just saying, when you're supporting InfoWars with that 1776 coin,
[00:36:57.822 --> 00:37:03.708]  You're also supporting yourself, because our forecast is the price of silver is going to go up.
[00:37:03.708 --> 00:37:14.117]  And as far as 1776 goes, I just turned 76 in November, so I'm fighting for the spirit of 1776.
[00:37:14.117 --> 00:37:21.785]  And that's something, those coins, that keeps it in your heart, because that's what this country was founded upon, that spirit that's been robbed from us.
[00:37:22.728 --> 00:37:32.193]  And so, you know, I'm just saying to people, you know, to me, you know, that's not only you're helping yourself, but you're also helping InfoWars.
[00:37:32.193 --> 00:37:49.983]  And again, we only see the prices going up on this because, Owen, the data coming out, all of the guesses on Wall Street is that the Federal Reserve is only going to raise interest rates 25 basis points when they finalize their meeting on February 1st.
[00:37:51.385 --> 00:37:58.428]  If they only raise them 25 basis points, you're going to see gold and silver prices skyrocket.
[00:37:58.428 --> 00:38:09.754]  If they don't, and they raise them 50 basis points, you're going to see the economy collapse, along with the stock market, which is also going to drive up gold and silver prices.
[00:38:10.425 --> 00:38:15.628]  So anyway, going back to Davos, we have lost our freedom in this country.
[00:38:15.628 --> 00:38:18.890]  And it's just totally disgusting what's happened to us.
[00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:23.132]  That we have these little clowns running and ruining our lives.
[00:38:23.132 --> 00:38:31.757]  And when you look at that guy Klaus Schwab, boy, I'll tell you, man, if Orwell was a cartoonist, he couldn't have come up with a more evil-looking figure like that cat.
[00:38:32.785 --> 00:38:34.046]  With those pointy ears?
[00:38:34.046 --> 00:38:34.246]  Yeah.
[00:38:50.589 --> 00:38:56.976]  And you know, I say to myself, man, Soros could keep his billions, man.
[00:38:56.976 --> 00:38:59.699]  If I look like that cat, I'd rather be dead.
[00:38:59.699 --> 00:39:02.583]  He's like Emperor Palpatine after he got like... Holy cheese!
[00:39:02.583 --> 00:39:04.505]  Can you imagine walking around?
[00:39:05.746 --> 00:39:08.530]  You know, look at me, look at these people.
[00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:08.910]  Look at them.
[00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:13.776]  Look at our, look who our Treasury Secretary is.
[00:39:13.776 --> 00:39:13.957]  Ms.
[00:39:13.957 --> 00:39:15.599]  Fauci, our Bruce.
[00:39:15.599 --> 00:39:16.800]  Janet Yellen.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.302]  We're the same age.
[00:39:18.302 --> 00:39:19.884]  So, my God, look at her.
[00:39:19.884 --> 00:39:21.867]  I'm not, okay.
[00:39:21.867 --> 00:39:24.169]  Maybe you're the same age, but are you the same species?
[00:39:26.391 --> 00:39:28.153]  I'm not sure Janet Yellen is a human.
[00:39:28.153 --> 00:39:28.953]  I mean, come on.
[00:39:28.953 --> 00:39:32.076]  That's a bad disguise for an alien.
[00:39:32.076 --> 00:39:32.836]  Look at her!
[00:39:32.836 --> 00:39:33.037]  Ms.
[00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:34.258]  Fatshah Brut.
[00:39:34.258 --> 00:39:34.958]  You know, by the way.
[00:39:34.958 --> 00:39:38.381]  That's like, hey, alien, can't you get a better disguise?
[00:39:38.381 --> 00:39:44.726]  And this is what's really important, is that here she is, our Treasury Secretary.
[00:39:44.726 --> 00:39:46.387]  Oh, and what was her last job?
[00:39:46.387 --> 00:39:48.829]  Look at this woman, Ma Long.
[00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:53.834]  Her last job was a Fed head, running the Federal Reserve.
[00:39:53.834 --> 00:39:54.234]  Wait a minute.
[00:39:54.838 --> 00:39:59.202]  I said before, you know, that it's not a revolving door.
[00:39:59.202 --> 00:40:09.272]  And again, that guy Lloyd Austin from sitting on the board of directors of Raytheon, now he's the defense secretary.
[00:40:09.272 --> 00:40:12.555]  And now somebody that was the head of the Federal Reserve is our U.S.
[00:40:12.555 --> 00:40:13.916]  Treasury Secretary?
[00:40:13.916 --> 00:40:15.238]  And no one's complaining about this?
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.502]  I mean, you can see the game is rigged right in front of your eyes.
[00:40:19.502 --> 00:40:22.823]  This is like all the FDA people that go over to Pfizer.
[00:40:22.823 --> 00:40:23.564]  It's the same thing.
[00:40:23.564 --> 00:40:25.405]  It's this insatious relationship.
[00:40:25.405 --> 00:40:28.466]  And then we've got the anti-fascists in the streets, Gerald!
[00:40:28.466 --> 00:40:31.028]  We got anti-fascists in the streets!
[00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:34.169]  And they don't know a damn thing about who the fascists are!
[00:40:34.169 --> 00:40:34.890]  Yep.
[00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:40.192]  You know, I had, again, I had this, uh, uh, yeah.
[00:40:40.192 --> 00:40:41.893]  Peace and freedom.
[00:40:41.893 --> 00:40:43.074]  Peace and freedom rally.
[00:40:44.301 --> 00:40:59.376]  My tenant in the 1774 Academy, a place called Rough Draft, they closed down at two o'clock when we began because, quote, it was a political rally and they didn't want to be open.
[00:40:59.376 --> 00:41:00.717]  A political rally?
[00:41:00.717 --> 00:41:01.478]  Peace and freedom?
[00:41:02.808 --> 00:41:18.222]  Those are the little people that swallow all the crap that bought the COVID war, that hated me when I had a Peace and Freedom Rally, when little Andy Cuomo locked down everything in July of 2020.
[00:41:18.222 --> 00:41:20.404]  I did another one in July of 2021.
[00:41:20.404 --> 00:41:23.086]  And by the way, I died when I had
[00:41:28.982 --> 00:41:33.124]  The rally when everything was locked down, I died of the virus.
[00:41:33.124 --> 00:41:35.724]  So this really isn't me.
[00:41:35.724 --> 00:41:39.286]  You know, again... You've been raised from the dead.
[00:41:39.286 --> 00:41:46.048]  Yeah, the first... and I'm telling everybody that the products you're getting from InfoWars are going to help you stay healthy.
[00:41:46.048 --> 00:41:49.829]  This is the first book I worked on, Natural Healing, back in the 1980s.
[00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:55.031]  I have an honorary doctorate from the National University of Health Sciences.
[00:41:55.031 --> 00:41:56.692]  I haven't been sick in over three years.
[00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:06.297]  Because I take vitamins and supplements which are banned by Big Pharma, not allowed to talk to it, and we won't teach it to you when you go to medical school!
[00:42:06.297 --> 00:42:08.599]  You will only learn to give drugs!
[00:42:09.665 --> 00:42:18.227]  So what I'm saying to everybody listening, the products that you're getting from InfoWars not only helps you, it helps them.
[00:42:18.227 --> 00:42:29.869]  And it's very important now to get in the best shape you can, physically, emotionally, and spiritually, because we are in the fight of our lives.
[00:42:29.869 --> 00:42:37.751]  If we don't stop these crazy people, these demonic people, from ruining our life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness,
[00:42:38.781 --> 00:42:40.442]  All aboard!
[00:42:40.442 --> 00:42:42.843]  Next train to Auschwitz!
[00:42:42.843 --> 00:42:43.503]  And that's what they want.
[00:42:43.503 --> 00:42:45.684]  That's what's going on in Brazil right now, folks.
[00:42:45.684 --> 00:42:53.567]  Look at how quickly the commies seized Brazil and are torturing people in their little fascist concentration camps.
[00:42:53.567 --> 00:42:54.868]  It happens fast, folks.
[00:42:54.868 --> 00:42:57.789]  We can't let it happen here, as we have been for decades, sadly.
[00:43:00.083 --> 00:43:06.305]  In early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[00:43:06.305 --> 00:43:14.688]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[00:43:14.688 --> 00:43:16.929]  So I thank you for your passion for support.
[00:43:16.929 --> 00:43:20.410]  Now that was a three coin series, the founding member coin.
[00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:25.832]  The final coin that we're putting out for a long time is the Teddy Roosevelt
[00:43:26.332 --> 00:43:31.237]  Man in the Arena coin exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[00:43:31.237 --> 00:43:37.002]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left.
[00:43:37.002 --> 00:43:40.606]  And yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[00:43:40.606 --> 00:43:45.811]  The coin is a collector's item memento of your support during the Second American Revolution.
[00:43:46.351 --> 00:43:51.957]  So if you want to get one of these coins, they're going fast and you can get $30 off on the coin with promo code 1776 at 1776coin.com.
[00:43:51.957 --> 00:43:52.677]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[00:43:52.677 --> 00:43:53.918]  InfoWarsMD is finally here.
[00:44:02.987 --> 00:44:19.683]  It's the very same high quality products you've been getting through InfoWars Life but an expanded catalog and in some cases the prices are lower because we're going directly to the source that was supplying the supplement companies that we were buying our high quality products from.
[00:44:19.683 --> 00:44:25.569]  So we're able to lower prices and bring you more products via the InfoWars MD line.
[00:44:26.129 --> 00:44:28.691]  The highest quality, triple tested.
[00:44:28.691 --> 00:44:32.634]  Many of these products are sold on store shelves for more than twice the cost.
[00:44:32.634 --> 00:44:37.138]  You'll get them at InfoWarsTore.com under our exclusive label.
[00:44:37.138 --> 00:44:43.062]  We're bringing you the highest quality supplements directly from the factory, right here in the USA, to your door.
[00:44:43.062 --> 00:44:48.927]  It'll make your life healthy, better, boost your immune system, and it keeps InfoWarsTore on the air.
[00:44:48.927 --> 00:44:54.411]  So again, introducing InfoWars MD, now exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com with
[00:45:00.319 --> 00:45:07.189]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[00:45:07.987 --> 00:45:10.029]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[00:45:10.029 --> 00:45:11.730]  They know we're telling the truth.
[00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:13.311]  They know we've got their number.
[00:45:13.311 --> 00:45:18.035]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[00:45:18.035 --> 00:45:25.901]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[00:45:25.901 --> 00:45:36.290]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds like preglanone and so much more to supercharge your body.
[00:45:37.341 --> 00:45:37.681]  I think so.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:09.386]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[00:46:09.386 --> 00:46:18.533]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[00:46:19.053 --> 00:46:25.658]  We've gone right to the manufacturer, who are listeners, the owners of Fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail.
[00:46:25.658 --> 00:46:31.122]  40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[00:46:31.122 --> 00:46:32.683]  And not just under one name.
[00:46:32.683 --> 00:46:38.168]  They sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[00:46:38.168 --> 00:46:42.251]  The difference is, we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[00:46:42.671 --> 00:46:44.552]  We're talking about Pain MD.
[00:46:44.552 --> 00:46:47.234]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[00:46:47.234 --> 00:46:50.096]  We're talking about 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[00:46:50.096 --> 00:46:51.897]  These things are incredible.
[00:46:51.897 --> 00:46:56.661]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your health care provider.
[00:46:56.661 --> 00:46:57.841]  Those are so powerful.
[00:46:57.841 --> 00:47:01.304]  Get them at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:47:01.304 --> 00:47:07.208]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:25.416 --> 00:47:27.557]  Gerald Salente is with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:27.557 --> 00:47:29.619]  Owen Troyer filling in for Alex.
[00:47:29.619 --> 00:47:35.422]  And I was unaware that Gerald had recently celebrated his 76th birthday.
[00:47:35.422 --> 00:47:37.103]  We give him a belated happy birthday.
[00:47:37.103 --> 00:47:38.844]  But Gerald, I do know this.
[00:47:38.844 --> 00:47:43.527]  At 76, you still like to boogie, don't ya?
[00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:44.788]  Oh yeah, because you know why.
[00:47:45.908 --> 00:47:50.309]  You got to boogie before the lights go out, because tomorrow is iffy.
[00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:52.249]  So I want to have a good time.
[00:47:52.249 --> 00:47:55.350]  And boy, I'll tell you, it's tough to have a good time up here anymore.
[00:47:55.350 --> 00:48:00.691]  This COVID war, the damage it's done is incalculable.
[00:48:00.691 --> 00:48:04.151]  Nine o'clock, I went to a New Year's Eve party up in Woodstock.
[00:48:04.151 --> 00:48:07.012]  Woodstock is about 15 minutes away from me.
[00:48:07.012 --> 00:48:11.853]  I left after 12 o'clock, took the Maiden Route back, you know, it's Route 28.
[00:48:11.853 --> 00:48:13.053]  I counted five cars.
[00:48:14.344 --> 00:48:20.546]  Last night, I was about, you know, about a half hour away from here, a place called Saugerties.
[00:48:20.546 --> 00:48:23.127]  I drove back on Route 9W.
[00:48:23.127 --> 00:48:31.370]  When I left the town, from Saugerties to Kingston, there was not one car behind me or in front of me.
[00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:32.790]  Dead at 9.30 at night.
[00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:36.670]  The damage?
[00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:40.213]  It used to be up in Woodstock when I moved up here years ago.
[00:48:40.213 --> 00:48:42.435]  We're going out 10.30 at night.
[00:48:42.435 --> 00:48:43.356]  That's when we started going.
[00:48:43.356 --> 00:48:44.878]  Bans everywhere.
[00:48:44.878 --> 00:48:47.000]  Hardly anything.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.321]  Life is dead.
[00:48:48.321 --> 00:48:51.404]  There's no fun going on.
[00:48:51.404 --> 00:48:53.806]  They sucked the joy out of life.
[00:48:53.806 --> 00:48:55.207]  The COVID war.
[00:48:55.207 --> 00:48:59.992]  And that clown woman on the Cartoon News Network that you called CNN.
[00:49:00.959 --> 00:49:11.249]  These little prostitutes, they're media whores that get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and government whoremasters.
[00:49:11.249 --> 00:49:15.513]  I remember the arrogance of spewing out of her mouth.
[00:49:15.513 --> 00:49:18.556]  The clown up in Canada, one after another.
[00:49:19.617 --> 00:49:21.178]  One little jerk.
[00:49:21.178 --> 00:49:22.758]  Telling us what to do.
[00:49:22.758 --> 00:49:25.919]  Oh, and I love the thing they have to have doctor in front of their name.
[00:49:25.919 --> 00:49:27.360]  Doctor in front of their name.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.520]  Hey, Frank!
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.620]  Hey, Susie!
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:30.941]  Oh, no, no!
[00:49:30.941 --> 00:49:32.721]  I'm a doctor!
[00:49:32.721 --> 00:49:34.682]  I'm better than you are!
[00:49:34.682 --> 00:49:37.263]  Hey, call me Transalenti, alright?
[00:49:38.251 --> 00:49:46.654]  So these people sold the lies that we were detailing week after week after week in the Trends Journal.
[00:49:46.654 --> 00:49:54.096]  You talked about how the people going into the hospitals had pre-existing comorbidities.
[00:49:54.096 --> 00:50:04.700]  Even the CDC came out and said that 94% of the people that died of COVID, I think was 2.6 pre-existing comorbidities.
[00:50:06.081 --> 00:50:21.116]  The people between 1 to 17 years old, there are about 73 million 1 to 73 year olds in the United States.
[00:50:21.116 --> 00:50:28.363]  60% of those that were hospitalized, according to the CDC, were obese.
[00:50:28.363 --> 00:50:29.123]  Oh, and how many died?
[00:50:30.627 --> 00:50:37.936]  Again, the numbers, it's around under 2,000 over a period of almost three years.
[00:50:37.936 --> 00:50:40.198]  Wait a minute, 2,000 people from 73 million died?
[00:50:50.078 --> 00:51:01.825]  2,000 out of 73 million died and you're injecting them with an Operation Warp Speed gene therapy inoculation?
[00:51:01.825 --> 00:51:02.585]  Yes!
[00:51:02.585 --> 00:51:05.687]  And if you don't get one, you don't have a job!
[00:51:05.687 --> 00:51:07.788]  Yeah, heil Hitler!
[00:51:07.788 --> 00:51:09.069]  Welcome to America!
[00:51:10.601 --> 00:51:12.743]  My body, my choice, Gerald!
[00:51:12.743 --> 00:51:14.865]  It's my body, my choice!
[00:51:14.865 --> 00:51:16.086]  I want to kill that baby!
[00:51:16.086 --> 00:51:18.848]  And then you ask the same people, do I have a choice to take a vaccine?
[00:51:18.848 --> 00:51:21.350]  Well, that's different!
[00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:21.731]  Oh, I see.
[00:51:21.731 --> 00:51:33.681]  Not only is it different, not only is it different, they spent, according to CNBC, when that number came out, some $7 million promoting the vaccination.
[00:51:33.681 --> 00:51:34.862]  I'm sure you saw this.
[00:51:35.595 --> 00:51:44.162]  The State Supreme Court in Syracuse, New York struck down a statewide mandate for medical staff to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
[00:51:44.162 --> 00:51:58.453]  In a landmark ruling issued January 13th, New York State Supreme Court Judge Gerard Neary declared that statewide COVID vaccine mandate for medical staff null, void, and of no effect.
[00:51:58.453 --> 00:52:03.858]  Neary also found that the mandate was, quote, arbitrary and capricious.
[00:52:04.847 --> 00:52:13.713]  Citing evidence that COVID-19 vaccines do not prevent the spread of viruses undercutting the basis for the mandate.
[00:52:13.713 --> 00:52:25.741]  Quote, in true Orwellian fashion, the respondents acknowledged then current COVID-19 shots do not prevent transmission.
[00:52:25.741 --> 00:52:27.222]  End quote.
[00:52:27.222 --> 00:52:28.903]  Neri wrote.
[00:52:28.903 --> 00:52:29.404]  Goes on.
[00:52:30.586 --> 00:52:49.655]  He wrote, quote, a term which is defined at the whim of an entity subject to change without a moment's notice contains all the hallmarks of absurdity and is no definition at all.
[00:52:49.655 --> 00:52:53.157]  You think this made the mainstream news?
[00:52:53.157 --> 00:52:55.158]  The one that you wrote about that arrogant
[00:52:55.979 --> 00:52:58.141]  Person on the Cartoon Network?
[00:52:58.141 --> 00:52:59.942]  Oh, that wasn't big news.
[00:52:59.942 --> 00:53:00.422]  Oh!
[00:53:00.422 --> 00:53:03.945]  Oh my God, I wonder how Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are doing.
[00:53:03.945 --> 00:53:07.348]  Never heard of it before, but I only had to hear about it for about a year.
[00:53:10.834 --> 00:53:18.260]  Well, and now they are, I think some of them are realizing, uh-oh, we have a little bit of a culpability issue here.
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:21.022]  We promoted these vaccines, maybe they feel bad.
[00:53:21.022 --> 00:53:27.768]  Maybe the loving, liberal, tolerant leftists that used to be anti-Big Pharma, they used to be anti-Big Pharma.
[00:53:27.768 --> 00:53:29.029]  Here's a funny one for you.
[00:53:29.029 --> 00:53:34.433]  You know who, you know that little pipsqueak nincompoop Robert Third Reich?
[00:53:34.433 --> 00:53:35.394]  You know Robert Third Reich?
[00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:37.830]  No.
[00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:40.572]  Well, he's a little liberal nincompoop.
[00:53:40.572 --> 00:53:44.434]  He always pops up and is spewing his liberal politics.
[00:53:44.434 --> 00:53:54.078]  And now, after promoting the vaccine for two years, he's now publicly going against Big Pharma and against them for making all of these profits.
[00:53:54.078 --> 00:53:59.361]  It's so funny to watch the liberal left be two, three years late to the news.
[00:53:59.361 --> 00:54:01.121]  Liberals used to be anti-Big Pharma.
[00:54:01.121 --> 00:54:02.102]  You know this.
[00:54:02.102 --> 00:54:02.962]  I know.
[00:54:02.962 --> 00:54:03.963]  In my generation.
[00:54:04.563 --> 00:54:06.125]  They're little cowards.
[00:54:06.125 --> 00:54:10.209]  Look at Crosby, Nills, Stash and Young.
[00:54:10.209 --> 00:54:12.971]  Look at that arrogant little Jimmy Kimmel.
[00:54:12.971 --> 00:54:14.653]  Look at that pencil head guy.
[00:54:19.497 --> 00:54:20.817]  Little clowns!
[00:54:20.817 --> 00:54:23.178]  Little boys of nothing!
[00:54:23.178 --> 00:54:24.879]  Little boys of nothing!
[00:54:24.879 --> 00:54:27.600]  You don't get vaxxed if you have no rights.
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:33.802]  Oh, by the way, all of these guys, you know, I said I'm 76, so I'm at the height of the Vietnam War.
[00:54:33.802 --> 00:54:35.843]  They're drafting everybody.
[00:54:35.843 --> 00:54:40.605]  And by the way, I was too stupid as a young guy in my early 20s.
[00:54:40.605 --> 00:54:41.805]  I swallowed the crap.
[00:54:42.674 --> 00:54:51.297]  I believed, I believed that, you know, if we don't stop those, those commies in Vietnam, they're gonna hit the shores of California, the dominoes will keep falling.
[00:54:51.297 --> 00:54:52.678]  I believed it.
[00:54:52.678 --> 00:55:00.021]  All these little boys that protested the war, that are so pro-vax, you know why they protested the war?
[00:55:00.021 --> 00:55:03.262]  Because they were getting drafted.
[00:55:03.262 --> 00:55:06.143]  When the draft ended, the protests ended.
[00:55:07.375 --> 00:55:10.896]  They're arrogant little nobodies with bad attitudes.
[00:55:10.896 --> 00:55:13.717]  Yeah, actually, they all love the war in Ukraine now.
[00:55:13.717 --> 00:55:14.957]  That's right.
[00:55:14.957 --> 00:55:15.378]  That's right.
[00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:16.358]  They're going over there.
[00:55:16.358 --> 00:55:18.178]  One little, one little clown.
[00:55:18.178 --> 00:55:23.320]  Oh, by the way, why shouldn't the comedians and clowns go there?
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:35.084]  Because the guy that's playing president of Ukraine was a comedian playing a sitcom as the president of Ukraine and playing the piano with his penis.
[00:55:35.664 --> 00:55:37.927]  Of course they love him!
[00:55:37.927 --> 00:55:41.331]  It's a Sean Pencil guy!
[00:55:41.331 --> 00:55:45.876]  It's Sean Pencil playing the piano with the penis!
[00:55:45.876 --> 00:55:49.199]  It's one little nothing boy after another.
[00:55:49.199 --> 00:55:56.848]  Anybody that wants to go support Ukraine, pack up your gear, send your wife, your kids, your partners, or whoever,
[00:55:57.808 --> 00:55:59.070]  And go join the fight!
[00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:01.052]  Send your money, or shut your mouth!
[00:56:18.232 --> 00:56:22.014]  Gee, it seems like Russia's actually having strategic victory!
[00:56:22.014 --> 00:56:22.914]  What's going on?
[00:56:22.914 --> 00:56:26.336]  What happened to the 150 billion US dollars?
[00:56:26.336 --> 00:56:27.636]  What happened to all the weapons?
[00:56:27.636 --> 00:56:29.838]  What happened to the news saying the Russians were getting crushed?
[00:56:29.838 --> 00:56:32.639]  My goodness, we were wrong again!
[00:56:32.639 --> 00:56:44.284]  Well, you're partially right on that, because I really want to go into that in detail, and why people need to support InfoWars, because you're bringing out the truth, as we do with the Trends Journal.
[00:56:44.284 --> 00:56:45.525]  I want to read you some headlines.
[00:56:46.287 --> 00:56:53.831]  Ukraine's armed forces working to exhaust Russia's as much as possible on Soledad Front.
[00:56:53.831 --> 00:56:56.192]  That's Tuesday, January 10th.
[00:56:56.192 --> 00:56:57.913]  Ready for this one?
[00:56:57.913 --> 00:57:01.595]  This is from a clown on Financial Times.
[00:57:01.595 --> 00:57:04.257]  Ukraine war has completely gone wrong for Putin.
[00:57:05.351 --> 00:57:07.234]  FT Journalist says.
[00:57:07.234 --> 00:57:08.175]  You ready?
[00:57:08.175 --> 00:57:11.699]  The facts behind the most bloody battle in Ukraine.
[00:57:11.699 --> 00:57:15.504]  And they go on to say Russia's capture of Solidar.
[00:57:15.504 --> 00:57:18.888]  They go on, this whole thing.
[00:57:18.888 --> 00:57:21.051]  How the Russians are losing.
[00:57:21.051 --> 00:57:23.554]  And they keep going on and on and on.
[00:57:24.838 --> 00:57:26.539]  It's the modern day Tokyo Rose.
[00:57:26.539 --> 00:57:28.140]  Gerald, hold it right there.
[00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:33.964]  Let's focus on this issue when we come back here for the second hour of the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:33.964 --> 00:57:38.987]  We're getting into the situation in Ukraine with Gerald Cilente and so much more on this Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:38.987 --> 00:57:45.651]  And don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, this Tuesday, this Tuesday, we've got an extended special broadcast.
[00:57:45.651 --> 00:57:47.152]  I'll tell you more about that coming up as well.
[00:57:49.201 --> 00:57:51.022]  InfoWars is winning.
[00:57:51.022 --> 00:57:53.063]  InfoWars is reaching more people than ever.
[00:57:53.063 --> 00:57:55.864]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[00:57:55.864 --> 00:57:58.605]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[00:57:58.605 --> 00:58:00.706]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[00:58:00.706 --> 00:58:02.766]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[00:58:02.766 --> 00:58:03.727]  None of that's true.
[00:58:03.727 --> 00:58:05.107]  It's all being appealed.
[00:58:05.107 --> 00:58:07.228]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead.
[00:58:07.228 --> 00:58:14.091]  But if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals, and we will not be taken off the air.
[00:58:14.091 --> 00:58:17.012]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[00:58:17.512 --> 00:58:20.214]  Don't let the globalists psyop you and your family.
[00:58:20.214 --> 00:58:30.581]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, that fund the InfoWar and empower your life and let the globalists know their psyop has not worked.
[00:58:30.581 --> 00:58:31.942]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[00:58:31.942 --> 00:58:35.965]  Take action at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[00:58:36.345 --> 00:58:40.432]  Because the only people who can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners.
[00:58:40.432 --> 00:58:43.817]  The majority of you have not been signed off, but some of you have.
[00:58:43.817 --> 00:58:45.801]  Do not let the gloveless brainwash you.
[00:58:45.801 --> 00:58:47.503]  Go to m4astore.com to keep us on the air.
[00:58:49.878 --> 00:58:53.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:59:02.686]  I want to encourage you all to go to InfoWarsTore.com and check it out for yourself because it is a very strong, high quality formula.
[00:59:02.686 --> 00:59:07.749]  Gallon out sleep support, liquid, it's very fast acting, take it under the tongue.
[00:59:07.749 --> 00:59:16.014]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin, passion flower, valerian root extract, lemon balm, and German chamomile.
[00:59:16.014 --> 00:59:18.196]  All of these compounds are documented on record
[00:59:18.536 --> 00:59:18.936]  I think so.
[00:59:52.403 --> 00:59:56.050]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:06.767 --> 01:00:08.529]  We're good to go.
[01:00:20.535 --> 01:00:27.956]  And folks, remember, this Tuesday it is the Alex Jones Was Right Emergency Broadcast.
[01:00:27.956 --> 01:00:34.038]  And we're going to flood the internet with the hashtag Alex Jones Was Right.
[01:00:34.038 --> 01:00:36.958]  We're going to try to make it the top trend all day long.
[01:00:36.958 --> 01:00:38.759]  Hashtag Alex Jones Was Right.
[01:00:38.759 --> 01:00:44.260]  So get ready to blast your social media pages with hashtag Alex Jones Was Right on Tuesday.
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:45.260]  You can watch it live.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:57.092]  ConspiracyFact.info or AlexWasRight.com, the new URLs to share, because as you can see, Twitter still censors all of us.
[01:00:57.092 --> 01:01:00.875]  So, you know, look, I still like what Elon Musk is doing overall.
[01:01:01.716 --> 01:01:04.599]  I think he's moving the ball in the right direction.
[01:01:04.599 --> 01:01:06.361]  We'll call it as we see it.
[01:01:06.361 --> 01:01:07.722]  If he goes sideways, that's fine.
[01:01:07.722 --> 01:01:15.691]  But I'm not going to take what is happening to us at InfoWars and have that be the final decision on what we think about Elon Musk.
[01:01:15.691 --> 01:01:16.652]  We'll give it fair coverage.
[01:01:16.652 --> 01:01:19.855]  But still, you notice, folks, Alex Jones not allowed back on.
[01:01:19.855 --> 01:01:21.657]  Harrison Smith, myself, not allowed back on.
[01:01:22.631 --> 01:01:26.072]  And so we still can't even share Banned.Video links on Twitter.
[01:01:26.072 --> 01:01:27.272]  So, you found it!
[01:01:27.272 --> 01:01:29.653]  This is the most banned news network in the world.
[01:01:29.653 --> 01:01:31.774]  We are the most banned individuals in the world.
[01:01:31.774 --> 01:01:35.455]  And that's why your support at Infowarsstore.com is so imperative.
[01:01:35.455 --> 01:01:37.935]  That's what we have to fund ourselves.
[01:01:37.935 --> 01:01:39.556]  So, Tuesday, tune in.
[01:01:40.536 --> 01:01:41.276]  8 a.m.
[01:01:41.276 --> 01:01:46.738]  Central to midnight, the Alex Jones Write Special Emergency Broadcast.
[01:01:46.738 --> 01:01:53.580]  And again, the new links to share, conspiracyfact.info, alexwaswrite.com.
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:56.740]  And Gerald, let's continue with this topic.
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:09.544]  Where do you see, as the creator of the Trends Journal, forecasting since 1980, still here doing it, where do you see the trends going as far as the war in Ukraine and Russia is concerned?
[01:02:11.093 --> 01:02:13.535]  Saying exactly what we said when it began.
[01:02:13.535 --> 01:02:17.077]  You're not going to defeat the Russians.
[01:02:17.077 --> 01:02:21.920]  Once upon a time, there was a guy by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.842]  He left Poland with 420,000 troops in 1812 to attack Moscow.
[01:02:23.842 --> 01:02:24.402]  Came back with 10,000.
[01:02:24.402 --> 01:02:24.422]  10,000!
[01:02:24.422 --> 01:02:25.242]  410,000 young guys murdered.
[01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:25.823]  Dead.
[01:02:37.541 --> 01:02:49.028]  Once upon a time, not too long ago, again I'm born a year after World War II, there was a thing called Operation Barbarossa launched by Adolf Hitler.
[01:02:49.028 --> 01:02:56.172]  He killed over 20 million Russians.
[01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:58.113]  Destroyed the country.
[01:02:58.113 --> 01:03:01.515]  Who were the first to defeat the Germans in World War II?
[01:03:01.515 --> 01:03:04.677]  No, sorry, it wasn't the Americans, it was the Russians.
[01:03:07.748 --> 01:03:17.093]  Owen, this is the cover when it used to be a monthly magazine, the Trends Journal, now it's a weekly.
[01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:22.256]  War or Peace, We the People Should Decide.
[01:03:22.256 --> 01:03:33.022]  An article by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former Assistant Treasury Secretary, under Ronald Reagan.
[01:03:33.022 --> 01:03:36.904]  Washington is driving the world to the final war.
[01:03:37.842 --> 01:03:43.065]  World hegemony is not a right America has earned.
[01:03:43.065 --> 01:03:50.409]  And this is a great Anthony Frieda article, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Obama, with a tank with his face into it.
[01:03:50.409 --> 01:03:55.032]  I just want to read you just a tiny part here.
[01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:58.574]  Washington concluded that Russia needed to be confronted with
[01:03:59.295 --> 01:04:08.798]  We're distracted by problems that will leave the Russian government less confident or able to counter Washington's aggression elsewhere.
[01:04:08.798 --> 01:04:15.641]  Ukraine presented the perfect opportunity for Washington to advance his hegemonic agenda.
[01:04:15.641 --> 01:04:26.925]  In a speech at the National Press Club last December, which was December 2013, Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland posted
[01:04:27.671 --> 01:04:40.416]  That Washington invested five billion dollars in non-governmental organizations, NGOs in Ukraine, for the purpose, you ready?
[01:04:40.416 --> 01:04:42.917]  To teach democracy.
[01:04:42.917 --> 01:04:45.918]  And now that Newland is running the same war.
[01:04:45.918 --> 01:04:46.858]  It's Newland again!
[01:04:46.858 --> 01:04:48.699]  I know.
[01:04:48.699 --> 01:04:51.400]  The United States overthrew the government.
[01:04:52.651 --> 01:04:53.853]  The people have no idea.
[01:04:53.853 --> 01:04:59.023]  No, the American media has lied to the people of almost everything about what's going on in Ukraine, but of course they did.
[01:04:59.023 --> 01:05:02.811]  I want you to remember two words.
[01:05:02.811 --> 01:05:03.873]  InfoWars Platinum.
[01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:05.382]  Yeah.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:35.542]  What they're sold on stores, over 20% off what they're sold online under the InfoWars Platinum brand name.
[01:05:35.542 --> 01:05:36.642]  These are incredible.
[01:05:36.642 --> 01:05:43.084]  Pain MD, HGH Max Boost, and of course, 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[01:05:43.084 --> 01:05:51.086]  Read about them at InfoWarsStore.com, learn about them, and then try them out for yourself, and I know you will be a repeat customer, which is awesome.
[01:05:51.086 --> 01:05:56.548]  It'll empower your life, make your life more amazing, and it will keep us on the air of 360WIN.
[01:05:56.548 --> 01:05:57.388]  InfoWars Platinum.
[01:05:57.688 --> 01:06:07.493]  Now available at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:06:07.493 --> 01:06:08.714]  You found it.
[01:06:08.714 --> 01:06:10.695]  The tip of the spear.
[01:06:10.695 --> 01:06:15.578]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:06:21.864 --> 01:06:24.707]  And we're here with Gerald Solente.
[01:06:24.707 --> 01:06:38.942]  And Gerald, I want to go back to something you said earlier about your rally, your peace rally that you had recently, and a phenomenon of stores wanting to close down because I think it tells a bigger story.
[01:06:38.942 --> 01:06:41.885]  I think it tells a bigger story about what's going on in America where...
[01:06:42.992 --> 01:07:01.399]  Not too long ago, and this is how a free market capitalist society would be functioning healthy, if it was functioning healthily, if somebody was coming to town, let's say an event or a rally or whatever, if you're a business owner, you embrace that opportunity because you get business!
[01:07:02.159 --> 01:07:09.907]  Whether you agree with the politics of the people you're going to be serving or not, you understand this is an opportunity to make business.
[01:07:09.907 --> 01:07:20.036]  So I think it's an incredible kind of side story that when you're about to have your rally, instead of embracing this opportunity for business and economy, they shut down.
[01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:21.438]  I think that's a telling story.
[01:07:21.438 --> 01:07:23.260]  That's what happens in communist countries.
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:28.562]  That's what happens in countries that are going the wrong way economically.
[01:07:28.562 --> 01:07:32.663]  And your kind of little pocketed story there, I think it just tells that story.
[01:07:32.663 --> 01:07:34.384]  Would you agree?
[01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:36.184]  Absolutely, I agree with you.
[01:07:36.184 --> 01:07:47.988]  People don't like, a lot of people like me, but a lot of people can't stand me up here because they're little gutless cowards and they hate me because I, Gerald Cilenti, am an American patriot.
[01:07:48.906 --> 01:07:51.808]  I believe in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:07:51.808 --> 01:07:56.771]  I don't believe in little clowns, politicians telling me what to do.
[01:07:56.771 --> 01:07:58.312]  I believe in human rights.
[01:07:58.312 --> 01:08:00.793]  Do what you want to do, don't tell me what to do.
[01:08:00.793 --> 01:08:03.795]  Again, Owen, this is the poster.
[01:08:03.795 --> 01:08:06.517]  You know, we put a lot of money into this.
[01:08:06.517 --> 01:08:10.919]  We had, again, Judge Andrew Napolitano, Scott Ritter, Gary Null.
[01:08:10.919 --> 01:08:18.284]  The Hot Damn Band, by the way, the Hot Damn Band was brought to me by Aaron Neville's wife, who subscribes to the Trends Journal.
[01:08:19.127 --> 01:08:23.171]  You know, there are people that are totally pro-peace.
[01:08:23.171 --> 01:08:24.893]  There are more Ukrainian flags.
[01:08:24.893 --> 01:08:30.179]  These little boys, little nothing, little nothing little boys, hanging Ukrainian flags all over.
[01:08:30.179 --> 01:08:33.783]  More Ukrainian flags than American flags.
[01:08:33.783 --> 01:08:36.266]  More Ukrainian flags than Americans.
[01:08:36.266 --> 01:08:38.428]  A hundred Ukraine troops to train in
[01:08:40.026 --> 01:08:40.766]  Oklahoma.
[01:08:40.766 --> 01:08:41.607]  That's a great story.
[01:08:41.607 --> 01:08:42.687]  How about this?
[01:08:42.687 --> 01:08:48.729]  How about a hundred Iraqi troops to train in Moscow to defeat America?
[01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:51.010]  Oh my God, how could you do that?
[01:08:51.010 --> 01:08:56.632]  Oh, they complain, they say, Russia, Russia is using Iranian drones for the war in Ukraine.
[01:08:56.632 --> 01:09:02.815]  Ukraine, Ukraine wouldn't even have a fighting force if it wasn't for the West, if it wasn't for the United States.
[01:09:02.815 --> 01:09:05.616]  And it was Obama that, it's not Iranian drones.
[01:09:05.856 --> 01:09:07.237]  Those are US drones!
[01:09:07.237 --> 01:09:10.119]  Obama gave Iran our drone technology!
[01:09:10.119 --> 01:09:12.861]  It's our technology being used!
[01:09:12.861 --> 01:09:15.402]  Again, the whole thing is hypocrisy.
[01:09:15.402 --> 01:09:24.628]  And I want to make this point because I want to make it very clear why people need everything they do, they can do to support InfoWars.
[01:09:24.628 --> 01:09:29.472]  Because all you're getting are lies, outright lies, and propaganda.
[01:09:29.472 --> 01:09:31.393]  And I'm going to give you the proof right now.
[01:09:32.125 --> 01:09:35.706]  And again, with the Trends Journal, you know, it's the truth in trends.
[01:09:35.706 --> 01:09:36.986]  We don't tell you what to think.
[01:09:36.986 --> 01:09:38.306]  It's think for yourself.
[01:09:38.306 --> 01:09:39.707]  You ready?
[01:09:39.707 --> 01:09:42.127]  This is CBS News.
[01:09:42.127 --> 01:09:45.208]  Thursday, July 12th.
[01:09:45.208 --> 01:10:00.772]  Russia's capture of Soledad would allow it to sell a much-needed victory back home after months of humiliating setbacks and shrinking military aims.
[01:10:00.772 --> 01:10:01.292]  Stop.
[01:10:01.292 --> 01:10:01.712]  Wait a minute.
[01:10:03.687 --> 01:10:08.748]  Russia controls over 20% of the country.
[01:10:08.748 --> 01:10:10.949]  And it's the most important 20%.
[01:10:10.949 --> 01:10:17.550]  It's access to the Black Sea, it's Crimea, where a lot of the farming and stuff goes on.
[01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:18.591]  Right.
[01:10:18.591 --> 01:10:20.811]  So, what are you talking about?
[01:10:20.811 --> 01:10:22.932]  But anyway, it keeps going.
[01:10:22.932 --> 01:10:31.554]  Ukraine's resolve stealed STELED by signs of agreement on battle tank deliveries.
[01:10:32.738 --> 01:10:34.073]  Financial Times.
[01:10:34.073 --> 01:10:34.356]  You ready?
[01:10:35.209 --> 01:10:38.551]  UK and Poland confirmed tanks to Ukraine.
[01:10:38.551 --> 01:10:40.452]  And this is my favorite line.
[01:10:40.452 --> 01:10:47.615]  Ukraine says it needs 300 tanks to be able to liberate its territories from Russian occupation.
[01:10:47.615 --> 01:10:48.336]  How about 320 tanks?
[01:10:48.336 --> 01:10:51.537]  And what are you making up this number for?
[01:10:51.537 --> 01:10:53.138]  300 tanks?
[01:10:53.138 --> 01:10:56.580]  And they repeat this like they know what they're talking about.
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:57.761]  Yeah, tanks a lot.
[01:10:57.761 --> 01:11:01.823]  But hold on, the tank story is actually even worse.
[01:11:01.823 --> 01:11:04.224]  So here's how ridiculous this tank situation is.
[01:11:05.211 --> 01:11:18.618]  We're giving Ukraine American tank technology, which actually the Russians have better tank technology, because their tanks run on, I believe it's some sort of a nuclear fusion energy, whereas our tanks are still burning gasoline.
[01:11:18.618 --> 01:11:20.639]  Or it might be reversed that, I'm sorry.
[01:11:20.639 --> 01:11:22.160]  I think it's reversed that.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:26.723]  In other words, Russian tanks you cannot see from satellite radar.
[01:11:26.723 --> 01:11:28.864]  Russian tanks do not put a heat
[01:11:29.224 --> 01:11:29.444]  I think?
[01:11:50.561 --> 01:11:51.481]  Immediately!
[01:11:51.481 --> 01:11:55.563]  And of course, of course the military-industrial complex doesn't care, Gerald.
[01:11:55.563 --> 01:12:07.089]  They're raking in money hand over fist, and then we give Ukraine basically these... I mean, that's like going into a war wearing a hot pink fluorescent yellow costume saying, you'll never find me!
[01:12:07.089 --> 01:12:16.413]  And the hypocrisy beyond that, how come they weren't covering the disastrous Iraq war like this every day in the media?
[01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:18.131]  How come they weren't?
[01:12:18.131 --> 01:12:20.453]  Oh, because of embedded reporters?
[01:12:20.453 --> 01:12:22.775]  They're in bed with the government?
[01:12:22.775 --> 01:12:24.356]  You do what we tell you to do?
[01:12:24.356 --> 01:12:27.739]  How come the New York Times, the toilet paper of record?
[01:12:27.739 --> 01:12:33.804]  How come they weren't covering this day after day after day like they do the Ukraine war?
[01:12:33.804 --> 01:12:35.466]  BBC?
[01:12:35.466 --> 01:12:36.527]  How about one after?
[01:12:36.527 --> 01:12:40.150]  How come they weren't doing it day after day with the Afghan war?
[01:12:41.081 --> 01:12:42.102]  How come?
[01:12:42.102 --> 01:12:48.627]  Because they're prostitutes, they're media whores that get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and government whoremasters.
[01:12:48.627 --> 01:12:56.074]  Again, why the people need to support InfoWars, because you're, you know, I go to InfoWars every day to get the news that you're putting out there.
[01:12:56.074 --> 01:12:59.617]  I go to a lot of different places, but you guys are really on top of it.
[01:12:59.617 --> 01:13:01.979]  So people have to do everything they can to support this.
[01:13:01.979 --> 01:13:05.962]  And again, we're giving them history before it happens with the Trends Journal.
[01:13:05.962 --> 01:13:09.145]  And I want to just keep going on with this to show the people why.
[01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:14.210]  Russia's set for rare success with control of Keytown.
[01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:15.631]  That was the financial ties.
[01:13:15.631 --> 01:13:17.532]  Again, they'll control over 20% of the country.
[01:13:17.532 --> 01:13:19.094]  Rare success, Gerald.
[01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:20.134]  Rare success.
[01:13:20.134 --> 01:13:25.199]  I mean, look, I'm not trying to laugh at the plight of the Ukrainians, but folks, I mean, that is a joke.
[01:13:25.199 --> 01:13:27.180]  The Ukrainian army is devastated.
[01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:28.902]  They're devastated.
[01:13:28.902 --> 01:13:29.843]  They're losing.
[01:13:29.843 --> 01:13:32.205]  You ready for this one?
[01:13:32.205 --> 01:13:36.068]  Russia's Vladimir Putin afraid of coup.
[01:13:38.308 --> 01:13:47.034]  A source who is close to Putin claimed that the President will nominate his chosen heir already this year.
[01:13:47.034 --> 01:13:53.158]  And, this goes on, this is from the British Daily.
[01:13:53.158 --> 01:13:59.703]  According to his former ally, Putin will want to transfer his power to his chosen rather than risk a coup against him.
[01:14:02.017 --> 01:14:12.803]  And of course, we'll be lied to about this too, because the real situation, and this is what the American media is lying about, folks, you've got to understand, Putin actually has a soft spot in his makeup for the West.
[01:14:12.803 --> 01:14:15.464]  He kind of romanticizes the West a little bit.
[01:14:15.464 --> 01:14:18.986]  The generals and a lot of the people behind Putin, they despise the West.
[01:14:18.986 --> 01:14:26.750]  The reason why, if this story is true, the reason why there might be pressure to get rid of Putin is because he hasn't gone hard enough against America.
[01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:30.112]  The generals and some of these people behind Putin are like, what are you doing?
[01:14:30.112 --> 01:14:35.937]  Why are we putting up with this crap from these American cross-dressing fags?
[01:14:35.937 --> 01:14:38.639]  Again, this is another one.
[01:14:38.639 --> 01:14:42.402]  So now they're saying how Putin's ratings are tanking, right?
[01:14:42.402 --> 01:14:44.043]  They say that.
[01:14:44.043 --> 01:14:45.604]  And then I looked it up.
[01:14:45.604 --> 01:14:52.170]  Putin's approval rating ends at, in 2022, so a couple of weeks ago, 81%.
[01:14:55.142 --> 01:14:57.224]  81% of the people support him.
[01:14:57.224 --> 01:15:00.085]  Yeah, but Biden says, like, 20%, so you combine the two, that's 100.
[01:15:00.085 --> 01:15:13.673]  Oh, by the way, the more Biden goes down in the polls, and this thing is going to bring him down with him stealing the documents, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[01:15:13.673 --> 01:15:17.615]  They're going to get the people's mind off it, and they're going to ramp up the Ukraine war.
[01:15:17.615 --> 01:15:19.416]  Same with the crashing economy, Gerald.
[01:15:19.416 --> 01:15:20.137]  It's the same tactic.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:21.480]  Yep.
[01:15:37.942 --> 01:15:41.063]  But they're obviously afraid of subpoenas coming from the House.
[01:15:41.063 --> 01:15:44.864]  I don't know why else they would be admitting all these secret documents now.
[01:15:44.864 --> 01:15:46.104]  That's the only thing I can figure.
[01:15:46.104 --> 01:15:50.065]  We'll get Gerald Salenti's take on that from the Trends Journal on the other side of this break.
[01:15:50.065 --> 01:15:51.245]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:51.245 --> 01:15:53.525]  Owen Troyer, Gerald Salenti filling in today.
[01:15:53.525 --> 01:15:59.327]  Shop at InfoWarsStore.com to keep this transmission on the air.
[01:15:59.327 --> 01:16:05.308]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness Company.
[01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:16.979]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[01:16:16.979 --> 01:16:29.729]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:30.990]  We're good to go!
[01:16:59.511 --> 01:17:05.673]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war, and it takes money to fund an information war.
[01:17:05.673 --> 01:17:18.656]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level, and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear, and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting infowarestore.com right now and taking action.
[01:17:18.656 --> 01:17:23.617]  I thank you for your past support, and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[01:17:23.997 --> 01:17:27.980]  To keep Infowars on the air, we'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:29.441]  They're coming for you and your family.
[01:17:29.441 --> 01:17:30.681]  They're coming for me.
[01:17:30.681 --> 01:17:31.922]  They're coming for the children.
[01:17:31.922 --> 01:17:34.504]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[01:17:34.504 --> 01:17:37.866]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[01:17:37.866 --> 01:17:39.427]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[01:17:39.427 --> 01:17:41.529]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[01:17:41.529 --> 01:17:46.532]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two trimesters after these poison shots.
[01:17:46.932 --> 01:17:50.857]  We can and will save the children, and they are counting on us.
[01:17:50.857 --> 01:17:52.079]  Let's do it together.
[01:17:52.079 --> 01:17:54.362]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[01:17:54.362 --> 01:17:58.186]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:17:58.186 --> 01:17:59.168]  Now take action now!
[01:18:09.491 --> 01:18:11.853]  What if you had the plans to the Death Star?
[01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:15.136]  What if you knew the globalist operations that could stop it?
[01:18:15.136 --> 01:18:16.657]  Well, we've done the research.
[01:18:16.657 --> 01:18:19.299]  We have the number one best-selling book in the country.
[01:18:19.299 --> 01:18:21.401]  Not just in politics, but period.
[01:18:21.401 --> 01:18:23.203]  It's the Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:18:23.203 --> 01:18:26.265]  You get a signed copy of this, the last 1,400.
[01:18:26.265 --> 01:18:27.767]  Keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:18:27.767 --> 01:18:28.667]  Please take action.
[01:18:28.667 --> 01:18:30.829]  I want to thank you all for your past support.
[01:18:30.829 --> 01:18:36.154]  Get one of these signed copies and know you kept InfoWars on the air at the most critical juncture in our history.
[01:18:36.494 --> 01:18:38.457]  Again, 2023 is here.
[01:18:38.457 --> 01:18:40.460]  The last run of signed copies of the book.
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:42.422]  We also have unsigned copies as well.
[01:18:42.422 --> 01:18:44.866]  The signed copies are limited and are about to run out.
[01:18:44.866 --> 01:18:46.508]  Thank you for your support.
[01:18:46.508 --> 01:18:49.492]  Again, get yours at mfulworthstore.com.
[01:18:59.577 --> 01:19:05.819]  In early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[01:19:05.819 --> 01:19:14.202]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[01:19:14.202 --> 01:19:16.443]  So I thank you for your passionate support.
[01:19:16.443 --> 01:19:19.924]  Now that was a three coin series, the founding member coin.
[01:19:19.924 --> 01:19:25.346]  The final coin that we're putting out for a long time is the Teddy Roosevelt

[01:20:00.686 --> 01:20:06.571]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:21.576 --> 01:20:26.637]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, this Tuesday, the Alex Jones Was Right emergency broadcast.
[01:20:26.637 --> 01:20:35.939]  We're going to flood the social media web sphere with hashtag Alex Jones Was Right for an extended transmission, 8 a.m.
[01:20:35.939 --> 01:20:38.320]  all the way through midnight on Tuesday.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.361]  The links to share, conspiracyfact.info, alexwasright.com.
[01:20:42.361 --> 01:20:45.141]  Gerald Cilente is our guest here on the Alex Jones Show this Sunday.
[01:20:45.141 --> 01:20:47.102]  Owen Schroer filling in.
[01:20:47.102 --> 01:20:48.222]  Here's some of the latest
[01:20:49.246 --> 01:21:00.249]  When it comes to the Biden documents, and it's almost like the water is so muddied, I'm a little confused at how many different troves of classified documents Biden stole now.
[01:21:00.249 --> 01:21:01.549]  Is it three, four, five?
[01:21:01.549 --> 01:21:02.990]  It's hard to even keep track.
[01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:05.911]  More classified documents found at Biden's Delaware home.
[01:21:07.091 --> 01:21:08.332]  So he's keeping them in his home.
[01:21:08.332 --> 01:21:09.193]  They're not even as safe.
[01:21:09.193 --> 01:21:10.294]  They're hanging out in the garage.
[01:21:10.294 --> 01:21:12.376]  They're hanging out above a steakhouse.
[01:21:12.376 --> 01:21:14.718]  Aides and lawyers are finding them in files.
[01:21:14.718 --> 01:21:17.040]  They'd covered it up when they discovered it in November.
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.082]  Now they're acting like, oh, we're doing an investigation.
[01:21:19.082 --> 01:21:20.664]  It's all above board.
[01:21:20.664 --> 01:21:25.568]  Former Clinton adviser David Gergen says Biden risks being creamed by Doc's case.
[01:21:25.568 --> 01:21:26.669]  Very, very big deal.
[01:21:28.221 --> 01:21:36.172]  Uh, except he's a Democrat and he's compromised by China and other countries, so I don't think he's really gonna get burned.
[01:21:36.172 --> 01:21:39.215]  I mean, I don't think they want Kamala Harris in there.
[01:21:39.215 --> 01:21:43.481]  There's one winner in the Biden document's discovery, Donald Trump, says The Guardian.
[01:21:43.641 --> 01:21:44.842]  Oh, that's hilarious.
[01:21:44.842 --> 01:21:45.482]  So I love this.
[01:21:45.482 --> 01:21:55.188]  So they're admitting that the whole thing against Trump was political, but now that Biden actually committed the crimes they're accusing Trump of, now Trump's in the clear.
[01:21:55.188 --> 01:21:55.969]  Isn't that funny?
[01:21:55.969 --> 01:21:58.971]  Admitting the whole thing was political, but Biden blew it for him.
[01:21:58.971 --> 01:22:02.813]  Kentucky Democrats suggest Joe Biden may be impeached for war crimes in Ukraine.
[01:22:02.813 --> 01:22:05.715]  Yeah, starting a war with Russia without congressional approval, kind of a big deal.
[01:22:06.715 --> 01:22:08.036]  And then there's the Biden family.
[01:22:08.036 --> 01:22:16.639]  You know, they love to tell you how tight-knit of a family they are, but they never invite their granddaughter to the Christmas parties, and now Hunter Biden wants total distance.
[01:22:16.639 --> 01:22:21.542]  Hunter Biden asked court to deny a strange four-year-old daughter taking his surname.
[01:22:21.542 --> 01:22:28.945]  How many kids does Hunter Biden have, and how many grandkids does Joe Biden have, that they never allow around the family?
[01:22:28.945 --> 01:22:30.585]  Even worse than Bill Clinton.
[01:22:30.585 --> 01:22:31.206]  That's amazing.
[01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:35.474]  Representative Matt Gaetz downloads on corrupt DC swamp.
[01:22:35.474 --> 01:22:37.096]  If you think differently, you're hunted.
[01:22:37.096 --> 01:22:39.759]  That's right, just like Elon Musk, who is now facing a U.S.
[01:22:39.759 --> 01:22:42.342]  fraud trial over a Tesla tweet.
[01:22:42.342 --> 01:22:49.249]  But getting back to the Biden documents, Gerald, you know, I look at this and I really think there's an organic level here.
[01:22:49.249 --> 01:22:52.633]  I think, I don't see how the deep state of the Democrats
[01:22:53.314 --> 01:22:55.776]  Have any advantage in taking Biden out right now.
[01:22:55.776 --> 01:22:57.517]  I don't think they want Kamala Harris.
[01:22:57.517 --> 01:22:59.719]  The globalists certainly don't want Kamala Harris.
[01:22:59.719 --> 01:23:01.320]  Joe Biden is the compromised one.
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.142]  Joe Biden is the total puppet.
[01:23:03.142 --> 01:23:06.304]  We all know Harris, you know, that she might get a little uppity.
[01:23:06.304 --> 01:23:10.488]  And she's not compromised, I think, by foreign interests like Biden is.
[01:23:10.488 --> 01:23:15.592]  But with the whole Trump thing in the documents, now they have to focus on these documents because they made a big deal about Trump.
[01:23:16.312 --> 01:23:21.034]  They tried to hide it in November, now they're having to admit it, I think, because they're afraid of House subpoenas.
[01:23:21.034 --> 01:23:25.175]  But, Gerald, what's your take on the whole Biden stealing classified documents phenomenon?
[01:23:25.175 --> 01:23:26.476]  Do you think it's organic?
[01:23:26.476 --> 01:23:27.756]  Do you think it's a controlled thing?
[01:23:27.756 --> 01:23:28.936]  Do you think they want him out?
[01:23:28.936 --> 01:23:31.497]  What do you think's going on, Gerald Solente?
[01:23:31.497 --> 01:23:32.638]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:23:32.638 --> 01:23:34.098]  I don't know what they're going to do.
[01:23:34.098 --> 01:23:37.159]  But the thing is, no, they won't put Kamala Harris in there.
[01:23:37.159 --> 01:23:38.880]  They'll get somebody else in there running.
[01:23:41.288 --> 01:23:50.653]  They keep bringing him down so he won't run in 2024, but they're saying that he's going to announce within several weeks whether or not he's going to be running.
[01:23:50.653 --> 01:23:53.434]  Let's go back to the documents.
[01:23:53.434 --> 01:23:58.237]  They're going to start finding stuff about Hunter Biden.
[01:23:58.237 --> 01:24:07.482]  Again, going back to your Trends journals, going back to 2014, after the United States overthrew the democratically elected government of Viktor Yanukovych,
[01:24:08.507 --> 01:24:23.153]  All of a sudden, Hunter Biden and Chris Hines, the stepson of another arrogant boy, born on third base and thought he had a home run, John Kerry.
[01:24:23.153 --> 01:24:23.694]  That's right.
[01:24:23.694 --> 01:24:27.135]  It's Chris Hines of the Hines 57 family.
[01:24:27.135 --> 01:24:33.958]  They get a deal with Burisma Energy, a corrupt, like the rest of Ukraine, corporation.
[01:24:35.507 --> 01:24:40.570]  And they're making millions of dollars sitting on the board of directors of Burisma Energy.
[01:24:40.570 --> 01:24:45.033]  What does Hunter Biden or Chrissy Hines know about energy?
[01:24:45.033 --> 01:24:46.093]  Nothing.
[01:24:46.093 --> 01:24:47.934]  It's just one dirty deal.
[01:24:47.934 --> 01:24:51.016]  That might come out.
[01:24:51.016 --> 01:24:56.519]  And again, as I'm saying, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[01:24:56.519 --> 01:24:58.701]  Let's go back, not ancient history, 2021.
[01:24:58.701 --> 01:25:04.404]  Biden pulls all the troops out of
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.002]  Afghanistan?
[01:25:07.002 --> 01:25:07.442]  No!
[01:25:07.442 --> 01:25:10.325]  The Taliban ain't gonna take over!
[01:25:10.325 --> 01:25:12.166]  We'll be in control of Kabul!
[01:25:12.166 --> 01:25:13.547]  They're not gonna take over!
[01:25:13.547 --> 01:25:15.129]  And what happens?
[01:25:15.129 --> 01:25:17.431]  A bunch of American troops get slaughtered.
[01:25:17.431 --> 01:25:22.955]  Oh, and on the way out, the American troops slaughtered a bunch of innocent people that they covered up.
[01:25:22.955 --> 01:25:24.917]  Oh, what else happened?
[01:25:24.917 --> 01:25:25.658]  Countless
[01:25:26.667 --> 01:25:37.850]  Scores of billions of dollars of weapons, our money, left over there for the Taliban to use.
[01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:44.151]  Oh, and Biden's plummeting in the polls.
[01:25:44.151 --> 01:25:50.073]  And then, last year, just around this time, they start heating up with the Ukraine war.
[01:25:51.019 --> 01:25:56.121]  And the more, the more Biden comes out, we're gonna punish Putin, this and that.
[01:25:56.121 --> 01:25:57.961]  That's a quote, punish Putin.
[01:25:57.961 --> 01:26:00.662]  He keeps going up in the polls.
[01:26:00.662 --> 01:26:03.343]  Again, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[01:26:03.343 --> 01:26:09.325]  What followed, what followed the Great Depression?
[01:26:09.325 --> 01:26:10.965]  World War II.
[01:26:10.965 --> 01:26:12.686]  What followed the dot-com bust?
[01:26:12.686 --> 01:26:14.406]  The Nasdaq, it was gone.
[01:26:14.406 --> 01:26:16.767]  That Y2 baloney, over.
[01:26:16.767 --> 01:26:17.747]  Oh, all of a sudden?
[01:26:17.747 --> 01:26:17.767]  9-11.
[01:26:21.064 --> 01:26:27.386]  The people, again, 88% of the people swallow little Georgie Bush's crap.
[01:26:27.386 --> 01:26:30.947]  We're going to get that guy Osama Bin Laden dead or alive!
[01:26:30.947 --> 01:26:34.268]  You're going to do the same thing.
[01:26:34.268 --> 01:26:44.731]  The deeper Biden goes down, the more he's going to ramp up this war, and the morons that know nothing about the facts are going to follow.
[01:26:46.405 --> 01:26:47.606]  That's the way we see it.
[01:26:47.606 --> 01:26:49.808]  Yeah, there's a cover.
[01:26:49.808 --> 01:26:50.709]  In God we trust.
[01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:51.770]  What God?
[01:26:51.770 --> 01:26:59.776]  You know, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God.
[01:26:59.776 --> 01:27:02.378]  No God supports war.
[01:27:02.378 --> 01:27:07.663]  One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all?
[01:27:07.663 --> 01:27:12.126]  No, no, we became invisible for liberty and justice for all.
[01:27:12.126 --> 01:27:12.627]  It's only
[01:27:13.999 --> 01:27:30.428]  Punishment to the fullest, and we the people of Slavelandia, while the crooks like the JPMorgan Chase Gang that gets five felonies rigging the precious metals market, gets a slap on the wrist for $900 million in 2019.
[01:27:30.428 --> 01:27:33.169]  How come Jamie Dimon ain't in jail?
[01:27:33.169 --> 01:27:34.410]  Oh, I gotta be in Davos.
[01:27:35.791 --> 01:27:38.713]  Everything they've accused Donald Trump of, they've literally done.
[01:27:38.713 --> 01:27:40.854]  This secret documents thing is just the latest.
[01:27:40.854 --> 01:27:46.218]  Joe Biden, I mean, we know Joe Biden stole classified documents.
[01:27:46.218 --> 01:27:48.120]  Not just highly classified documents.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:57.026]  He stole the most highest level of classified documents that can't even be opened or read unless you're in a secured room.
[01:27:57.026 --> 01:28:01.569]  Again, I believe that, I'm guessing, I don't know.
[01:28:01.569 --> 01:28:03.691]  If this has to do with Ukraine,
[01:28:05.457 --> 01:28:06.977]  I'm telling you what's going to happen.
[01:28:06.977 --> 01:28:08.578]  Biden's just going to ramp up the war.
[01:28:08.578 --> 01:28:09.778]  People will forget about it.
[01:28:09.778 --> 01:28:13.179]  They will forget about it.
[01:28:13.179 --> 01:28:16.519]  Well, we're going to make sure they don't forget about it.
[01:28:16.519 --> 01:28:25.281]  And I don't know what Biden... I mean, at this point, the only thing Biden can do is just declare war on Russia, which he's really already done unconstitutionally.
[01:28:25.281 --> 01:28:26.722]  It's more than Russia.
[01:28:26.722 --> 01:28:28.382]  You're meeting with him.
[01:28:28.382 --> 01:28:30.042]  The United States is meeting with Japan.
[01:28:30.042 --> 01:28:33.563]  You saw that he met with the Japanese guy.
[01:28:34.355 --> 01:28:39.758]  Now, the Prime Minister of Japan, Kishida, and we come back, we really need to talk about this.
[01:28:39.758 --> 01:28:44.621]  All right, let's talk about Joe Biden and foreign relations.
[01:28:44.621 --> 01:28:47.122]  And man, I mean, you want to talk about U.S.
[01:28:47.122 --> 01:28:49.583]  foreign relations or U.S.
[01:28:49.583 --> 01:28:52.285]  just respect amongst world leaders.
[01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:55.367]  Ever since Biden has taken over, it has tanked.
[01:28:55.367 --> 01:28:59.229]  I mean, tanked.
[01:28:59.229 --> 01:29:01.190]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[01:29:02.568 --> 01:29:12.874]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections, to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[01:29:12.874 --> 01:29:14.115]  But, through Mother Nature,
[01:29:15.031 --> 01:29:20.317]  The Creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists have done.
[01:29:20.317 --> 01:29:25.442]  And I gotta tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game-changer now.
[01:29:25.442 --> 01:29:27.825]  We've never put anything out this powerful.
[01:29:27.825 --> 01:29:32.890]  It's InfoWars Platinum, now exclusively available at 40% off at InfoWars.com.
[01:29:33.911 --> 01:29:45.520]  This is private labeled three of the top best sellers in the country right now, but it's exclusively available under the brand name and private label of InfoWars Platinum at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:52.625]  It's HGH Boost Max, it's Pain MD, and it's 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[01:29:52.625 --> 01:29:57.769]  You owe it to yourself and your way of life and your well-being to try these out and fund the InfoWar.
[01:29:59.051 --> 01:30:00.874]  Infowars is winning.
[01:30:00.874 --> 01:30:02.917]  Infowars is reaching more people than ever.
[01:30:02.917 --> 01:30:05.701]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[01:30:05.701 --> 01:30:08.465]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[01:30:08.465 --> 01:30:10.569]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[01:30:10.569 --> 01:30:12.632]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[01:30:12.632 --> 01:30:13.593]  None of that's true.
[01:30:13.593 --> 01:30:14.495]  It's all being appealed.
[01:30:14.955 --> 01:30:23.921]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead, but if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals, and we will not be taken off the air.
[01:30:23.921 --> 01:30:27.364]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[01:30:27.364 --> 01:30:30.066]  Don't let the globalists psyop you and your family.
[01:30:30.066 --> 01:30:39.973]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, that fund the InfoWars and empower your life, and let the globalists know their psyop has not worked.

[01:30:53.667 --> 01:30:55.429]  Do not let the gloveless brainwash you.
[01:30:55.429 --> 01:30:57.371]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com to keep us on the air.
[01:30:58.826 --> 01:31:02.068]  Infowars MD is finally here!

[01:32:52.179 --> 01:33:00.743]  M4 Wars MD at m4warsstore.com.
[01:33:00.743 --> 01:33:06.645]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.831 --> 01:33:24.893]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.893 --> 01:33:28.835]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:28.835 --> 01:33:36.437]  It's actually a mystical phenomenon that everything they accuse Donald Trump of, they're guilty of.
[01:33:36.437 --> 01:33:38.718]  We're talking about the Democrats, generally speaking.
[01:33:39.318 --> 01:33:40.458]  Polluting with Russia.
[01:33:40.458 --> 01:33:42.119]  Oh no, that was Hillary Clinton.
[01:33:42.119 --> 01:33:44.239]  That was Joe Biden.
[01:33:44.239 --> 01:33:44.719]  That's right.
[01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:46.300]  Stealing classified documents.
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:47.880]  No, that was Barack Obama.
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:49.320]  No, that was Joe Biden.
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.421]  No, that was Hillary Clinton.
[01:33:51.421 --> 01:33:53.021]  And so I could continue to go on.
[01:33:53.021 --> 01:33:55.822]  I mean, do I even need to get into the whole Me Too thing?
[01:33:55.822 --> 01:33:57.622]  Bill Clinton compared to Donald Trump?
[01:33:57.622 --> 01:33:59.123]  I think we get the picture.
[01:33:59.123 --> 01:33:59.363]  So...
[01:34:00.868 --> 01:34:07.390]  Biden is being exposed, whether it's organic or part of some other ulterior motive.
[01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:10.371]  Biden is getting exposed for stealing the classified documents.
[01:34:10.371 --> 01:34:12.092]  There's nothing they can really do to cover it up.
[01:34:12.092 --> 01:34:16.213]  The only thing they can do is to drop the charges against Donald Trump to protect Joe Biden.
[01:34:16.213 --> 01:34:21.435]  Except, Gerald Solente, you know one thing they like to do to distract when they're about to go down.
[01:34:21.435 --> 01:34:23.516]  And let me just emphasize this before we respond.
[01:34:23.516 --> 01:34:29.858]  Not just about the secret documents being exposed, but really, Gerald, it really comes down to
[01:34:30.638 --> 01:34:32.819]  They're collapsing the economy.
[01:34:32.819 --> 01:34:52.551]  And so, the big giant thieves that have stolen all of our money, collapsing the economy, they know their time in the barrel is ahead of them, so they send us to war, as classical geopolitical criminals do, they send us to war, hoping that's the big distraction so they don't be held accountable for what they've done.
[01:34:52.551 --> 01:34:53.571]  Yep.
[01:34:53.571 --> 01:34:58.294]  And you know, you had that, you showed that cartoon of Biden in his Corvette.
[01:35:01.683 --> 01:35:13.469]  He said, when he was questioned by a reporter on Thursday, they asked Biden why he kept such files next to his classic Corvette in his garage.
[01:35:13.469 --> 01:35:19.412]  He said, by the way, my Corvette is in a locked garage.
[01:35:19.412 --> 01:35:20.373]  It's not likely.
[01:35:20.373 --> 01:35:24.795]  They're sitting out on the street.
[01:35:24.795 --> 01:35:27.256]  That's the response.
[01:35:27.256 --> 01:35:28.857]  Yeah, because nobody has a safe in their house.
[01:35:28.857 --> 01:35:30.278]  You know, we just leave things in our garage.
[01:35:30.945 --> 01:35:35.028]  Yeah, but that's the arrogant stupidity and they get away with it.
[01:35:35.028 --> 01:35:38.190]  And again, what we're talking about is not important.
[01:35:38.190 --> 01:35:46.756]  Because the Cartoon News Network, I just took a look at where the major stories are right on CNN.com, the front page.
[01:35:46.756 --> 01:35:51.720]  University of Georgia football player and staff member killed in car crash.
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:55.062]  Hours after championship celebration.
[01:35:55.062 --> 01:35:55.843]  That's not news.
[01:35:56.952 --> 01:35:58.833]  What if your buddy's killed in a car crash?
[01:35:58.833 --> 01:36:00.894]  Your mother, your father, nobody cares.
[01:36:00.894 --> 01:36:02.615]  Oh, wait, wait a minute.
[01:36:02.615 --> 01:36:03.636]  A football player.
[01:36:03.636 --> 01:36:08.139]  We heard about the other football player that got tackled and they had a heart condition.
[01:36:08.139 --> 01:36:09.199]  This is news?
[01:36:09.199 --> 01:36:15.683]  What I'm saying, Owen, is they're doing this to distract the people from the real issues.
[01:36:15.683 --> 01:36:18.685]  And we're talking about what Biden's going to do.
[01:36:18.685 --> 01:36:22.047]  So now, he met with the Prime Minister of Japan.
[01:36:22.047 --> 01:36:23.648]  You ready for this?
[01:36:25.242 --> 01:36:45.101]  Biden hailed what he called, quote, a remarkable moment in the U.S.-Japan alliance and praised Kishida, the Prime Minister of Japan's decision last month to double its military budget and boost its offensive capacity.
[01:36:45.101 --> 01:36:47.243]  Biden declared that the U.S., you ready?
[01:36:48.183 --> 01:36:56.472]  Was fully, thoroughly, completely committed to the defense of Japan using all means.
[01:36:56.472 --> 01:36:58.173]  And you know what other means we're going to use?
[01:36:58.173 --> 01:37:02.518]  Nuclear weapons.
[01:37:02.518 --> 01:37:05.341]  Meanwhile, the border is wide open.
[01:37:05.341 --> 01:37:05.761]  What?
[01:37:05.761 --> 01:37:07.843]  I could give a damn about Japan.
[01:37:07.843 --> 01:37:10.766]  Oh, you mean Japan to bomb Pearl Harbor?
[01:37:10.766 --> 01:37:11.387]  That Japan?
[01:37:12.287 --> 01:37:19.113]  To Japan that's not supposed to build up its military because of the atrocities they committed in World War II?
[01:37:19.113 --> 01:37:28.060]  And Truman doubled down on it by bombs away over Nagasaki and Hiroshima, killing a couple of hundred thousand innocent Japanese.
[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:29.601]  Are that World War II?
[01:37:29.601 --> 01:37:30.722]  And check this out.
[01:37:30.722 --> 01:37:33.024]  You ready?
[01:37:33.024 --> 01:37:33.325]  U.S.
[01:37:33.325 --> 01:37:36.968]  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin declared that 2023 was, quote,
[01:37:39.381 --> 01:37:53.913]  An inflection point for our national security and defense strategies aligning closer than ever, end quote, with Japan.
[01:37:53.913 --> 01:38:04.622]  Don't every American know that our national security and defense strategies depend on aligning with Japan?
[01:38:04.622 --> 01:38:05.663]  Well, fill in the blank.
[01:38:05.663 --> 01:38:06.924]  I am an American!
[01:38:07.845 --> 01:38:12.150]  I believe in the Founding Fathers, you little lowlives!
[01:38:12.150 --> 01:38:14.553]  I believe in George Washington!
[01:38:14.553 --> 01:38:24.845]  But you're too stupid, you clowns, to read his farewell address, where he warns American people not to become involved in foreign entanglements.
[01:38:29.194 --> 01:38:33.517]  But whether it's Japan, whether it's Ukraine, I mean it's fill in the blank.
[01:38:33.517 --> 01:38:43.383]  Whether it's Israel, our military interests, our foreign interests must be fully committed to align with Israel, or Ukraine, or Japan, or I forget what day of the week it is.
[01:38:43.383 --> 01:38:50.588]  And by the way, you know, they're spreading our military so thin, I think China is acting strategically here, as is Russia.
[01:38:51.368 --> 01:39:01.259]  You know, eventually the proxy groups and the CIA groups and whatever the government is doing in Syria is going to come to the front of the picture here too.
[01:39:01.259 --> 01:39:05.644]  They've been stealing oil from Syria and now the Chinese are saying you better stop that.
[01:39:06.305 --> 01:39:06.525]  You got it.
[01:39:06.525 --> 01:39:06.705]  And then...
[01:39:34.927 --> 01:39:45.635]  The other arrogant guy, Rahm Emanuel, who was under the Obama administration, now he's a U.S.
[01:39:45.635 --> 01:39:46.976]  ambassador to Japan.
[01:39:46.976 --> 01:40:03.127]  Rahm Emanuel told the Washington Post that Biden and Kushida were working, quote, to shrink the distance between the transatlantic and the Indo-Pacific into a single strategic sphere.
[01:40:04.145 --> 01:40:12.749]  In what, quote, is probably one of the biggest developments that the two leaders have produced.
[01:40:12.749 --> 01:40:14.610]  Isn't that nice?
[01:40:14.610 --> 01:40:16.551]  Isn't that nice?
[01:40:16.551 --> 01:40:20.472]  No, it's amazing watching the American media ignore this big phenomenon.
[01:40:20.472 --> 01:40:23.054]  Totally, totally, totally ignored.
[01:40:23.054 --> 01:40:24.754]  And here, check this out.
[01:40:24.754 --> 01:40:26.955]  Currently there are 18,000 U.S.
[01:40:26.955 --> 01:40:28.116]  Marines in Okinawa.
[01:40:29.722 --> 01:40:37.686]  As part of the 54,000 American military personnel stationed on bases throughout Japan.
[01:40:37.686 --> 01:40:40.787]  Isn't that great?
[01:40:40.787 --> 01:40:44.168]  Our country going down the toilet.
[01:40:44.168 --> 01:40:45.349]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:45.349 --> 01:40:48.190]  But look, look at the infrastructure of this country.
[01:40:48.190 --> 01:40:50.691]  Look how it's going down the toilet.
[01:40:50.691 --> 01:40:54.653]  Look at the 63% of American people living paycheck to paycheck.
[01:40:55.453 --> 01:41:01.476]  Look at the difficulty people are having with inflation going up, can't afford to buy food.
[01:41:01.476 --> 01:41:07.100]  But hey, we're going to keep sending more money overseas and have strategic alliances.
[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:17.886]  And, and, and, the bottom line is, look at the clowns, the morons, the evil imbeciles that are telling us what to do.
[01:41:20.165 --> 01:41:31.594]  Well, I think that, you know, eventually the American people have got to realize, whether it happens en masse or slowly but surely, how much the American media has disinformed them.
[01:41:31.594 --> 01:41:41.703]  I mean, everything that's come out about the war in Ukraine, as far as the mainstream American media is concerned, it's about 95% inaccurate and just completely missing the ball.
[01:41:41.703 --> 01:41:43.324]  And I don't know whether that's because they feel
[01:41:43.484 --> 01:41:44.064]  We're being crushed.
[01:41:44.064 --> 01:41:47.586]  We are going to go into a socio-economic downturn, the likes of which are unprecedented in this country.
[01:42:08.752 --> 01:42:17.218]  And again, they're very happy that you're saying that the raising interest rates are working because wages are going down.
[01:42:17.218 --> 01:42:19.099]  I'm not making that up.
[01:42:19.099 --> 01:42:28.485]  They're happy that wages are going down so the plantation workers of Slavelandia don't have to make more money and the Finks can make more money.
[01:42:29.403 --> 01:42:32.485]  Yeah, but Joe Biden says we've got the lowest unemployment rate.
[01:42:32.485 --> 01:42:35.587]  Oh, but it doesn't matter, because you can't even afford gas.
[01:42:35.587 --> 01:42:37.148]  You can't even afford eggs.
[01:42:37.148 --> 01:42:40.050]  That is, if you can find eggs on the shelf.
[01:42:40.050 --> 01:42:42.251]  And you can't afford your energy bill.
[01:42:42.251 --> 01:42:44.573]  Your price at the pump is all going up.
[01:42:44.573 --> 01:42:49.656]  And so, but the American media, hey, we got to fight that war in Ukraine.
[01:42:49.656 --> 01:42:51.417]  And Russia is losing.
[01:42:51.417 --> 01:42:53.238]  And Joe Biden is doing a great job.
[01:42:53.238 --> 01:42:54.799]  0% unemployment.
[01:42:54.799 --> 01:42:57.020]  Yeah, you know where 0% unemployment happens?
[01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:57.581]  In slaves.
[01:42:59.028 --> 01:43:05.070]  Early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[01:43:05.070 --> 01:43:13.454]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[01:43:13.454 --> 01:43:15.694]  So I thank you for your passion and support.
[01:43:15.694 --> 01:43:19.176]  Now that was a three coin series, the founding member coin.
[01:43:19.176 --> 01:43:24.598]  The final coin that we're putting out for a long time is the Teddy Roosevelt
[01:43:25.106 --> 01:43:29.931]  Man in the Arena coin exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[01:43:29.931 --> 01:43:35.757]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left.
[01:43:35.757 --> 01:43:39.360]  And yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:44.566]  The coin is a collector's item memento of your support during the Second American Revolution.
[01:43:45.126 --> 01:43:56.471]  So if you want to get one of these coins, they're going fast, and you can get $30 off on the coin with promo code 1776 at 1776coin.com.
[01:43:56.471 --> 01:43:58.652]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[01:43:58.652 --> 01:44:02.013]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[01:44:02.013 --> 01:44:12.297]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections, to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[01:44:12.297 --> 01:44:13.558]  But through Mother Nature,
[01:44:14.448 --> 01:44:19.754]  The Creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists have done.
[01:44:19.754 --> 01:44:24.879]  And I gotta tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game-changer now.
[01:44:24.879 --> 01:44:27.262]  We've never put anything out this powerful.
[01:44:27.262 --> 01:44:31.026]  It's InfoWars Platinum, now exclusively available at 40% off at InfoWars4.com.
[01:44:33.348 --> 01:44:44.954]  This is private labeled three of the top best sellers in the country right now, but it's exclusively available under the brand name and private label of InfoWars Platinum at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:44.954 --> 01:44:52.057]  It's HGH Boost Max, it's Pain MD, and it's 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[01:44:52.057 --> 01:44:57.180]  Yield it to yourself and your way of life and your well-being to try these out and fund the InfoWar.
[01:44:58.470 --> 01:45:00.311]  InfoWars is winning.
[01:45:00.311 --> 01:45:02.352]  InfoWars is reaching more people than ever.
[01:45:02.352 --> 01:45:05.133]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[01:45:05.133 --> 01:45:07.875]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[01:45:07.875 --> 01:45:09.976]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[01:45:09.976 --> 01:45:12.037]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[01:45:12.037 --> 01:45:13.017]  None of that's true.
[01:45:13.017 --> 01:45:14.398]  It's all being appealed.
[01:45:14.398 --> 01:45:16.039]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead.
[01:45:16.499 --> 01:45:23.365]  But if you simply stand up and support Infowars, we've got years and years of appeals, and we will not be taken off the air.
[01:45:23.365 --> 01:45:26.807]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.

[01:45:58.368 --> 01:46:04.534]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war.
[01:46:04.534 --> 01:46:17.526]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting Infowarsstore.com right now and taking action.

[01:46:26.833 --> 01:46:28.294]  They're coming for you and your family.
[01:46:28.294 --> 01:46:29.535]  They're coming for me.
[01:46:29.535 --> 01:46:30.776]  They're coming for the children.
[01:46:30.776 --> 01:46:33.357]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[01:46:33.357 --> 01:46:36.719]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[01:46:36.719 --> 01:46:38.040]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:40.361]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[01:46:40.361 --> 01:46:45.783]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots.
[01:46:45.783 --> 01:46:49.704]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[01:46:49.704 --> 01:46:50.924]  Let's do it together.
[01:46:50.924 --> 01:46:53.225]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[01:46:53.225 --> 01:46:57.026]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:47:15.066 --> 01:47:21.310]  Final segment here of the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, January 15th.
[01:47:21.310 --> 01:47:26.032]  Owen Troyer, Gerald Salente filling in for Alex this evening.
[01:47:26.032 --> 01:47:30.234]  Remember, Harrison Smith coming up next with Sunday Night Live.
[01:47:30.234 --> 01:47:34.397]  And everything we do here is brought to you by your support at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:41.100]  We are delivering.
[01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:41.601]  I suggest
[01:47:42.361 --> 01:47:46.783]  Trying it out, if you haven't yet, I drink Vitamin Mineral Fusion every morning.
[01:47:46.783 --> 01:47:49.845]  Every morning I mix it with juice and then chase down the rest of my supplements.
[01:47:49.845 --> 01:47:51.125]  Why?
[01:47:51.125 --> 01:47:59.710]  Because I'm getting over 100% the daily value of Vitamin A, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin E and so much more.
[01:48:01.135 --> 01:48:08.265]  Not to mention, there's things in there that you're just probably not getting in your diet, like boron and glycine and so much more.
[01:48:08.265 --> 01:48:09.928]  Look at the label for yourself.
[01:48:09.928 --> 01:48:10.789]  Read all the reviews.
[01:48:10.789 --> 01:48:14.154]  50% off Vitamin Mineral Fusion at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:17.261]  And it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[01:48:17.261 --> 01:48:21.664]  We're the most banned individuals and network in the world, right here.
[01:48:21.664 --> 01:48:26.146]  And, folks, I mean, don't take these transmissions for granted.
[01:48:26.146 --> 01:48:30.189]  They shut down InfoWars, you know, we'll have to scrape and claw just to find light.
[01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:33.751]  Uh, at the surface level.
[01:48:33.751 --> 01:48:38.113]  That's how much they have us censored, and that's how much they have us under attack.
[01:48:38.113 --> 01:48:59.425]  So, but your support at Infowarsstore.com keeps these transmissions on the air, and remember this Tuesday, the extended live transmission, hashtag Alex Jones was right, Tuesday live extended transmission, and we're gonna make that hashtag go viral worldwide, hashtag Alex Jones was right, that's this Tuesday, all made possible with your support at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:48:59.425 --> 01:48:59.745]  Alright!
[01:49:00.612 --> 01:49:02.875]  Gerald Salente here with me.
[01:49:02.875 --> 01:49:06.338]  Gerald, let's go local for you.
[01:49:06.338 --> 01:49:09.402]  You've got your new mayor, Eric Adams.
[01:49:09.402 --> 01:49:15.889]  You know, I mean, he's not as bad as de Blasio, but that's a pretty low bar, so I'm not really sure that's much of an accomplishment.
[01:49:16.770 --> 01:49:21.232]  You know, I find it funny his response to the immigration issues that are hitting New York City.
[01:49:21.232 --> 01:49:26.395]  And he comes out, Mayor Eric Adams acknowledges Biden's immigration policy failure.
[01:49:26.395 --> 01:49:32.298]  He then came out and recently said that the illegal immigration is costing New York City over a billion dollars a year.
[01:49:32.298 --> 01:49:34.259]  Now here's what I find ironic.
[01:49:34.259 --> 01:49:38.821]  So they recognize that the illegal immigration problem is a crisis for New York City,
[01:49:39.361 --> 01:49:44.444]  But they refuse to recognize how it's an issue for the entire country at large.
[01:49:44.444 --> 01:49:47.485]  It's an amazing thing that they refuse to make that recognition, Gerald.
[01:49:47.485 --> 01:49:51.587]  Again, he's just another arrogant guy.
[01:49:51.587 --> 01:49:54.489]  And people forget about the whole immigration thing.
[01:49:54.489 --> 01:50:02.813]  When I was a young kid, you know, growing up, I remember they wanted to bring my cousin Constantine over from Italy, but they couldn't.
[01:50:02.813 --> 01:50:04.194]  It wasn't allowed.
[01:50:04.833 --> 01:50:11.375]  They had very strict regulations on bringing people in from other countries.
[01:50:11.375 --> 01:50:19.018]  And then the lowlife that changed it, the beginning of the end, was LBJ.
[01:50:19.018 --> 01:50:21.819]  And the guy that gave us the Vietnam War as well.
[01:50:21.819 --> 01:50:28.101]  You know, Jack Kennedy was against the Vietnam War.
[01:50:28.101 --> 01:50:31.762]  And eight months after he's assassinated,
[01:50:32.873 --> 01:50:33.874]  What's his name?
[01:50:33.874 --> 01:50:40.079]  LBJ gets us into Vietnam War, and then they start bringing in all cheap labor.
[01:50:40.079 --> 01:50:41.340]  And that was the beginning.
[01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:42.741]  And that's why they did it.
[01:50:42.741 --> 01:50:47.385]  And it kept expanding with the H-1B things, the visas, on and on.
[01:50:47.385 --> 01:50:55.471]  I wrote about it in detail in my book, Trends 2000, which was an international bestseller that came out in 1996.
[01:50:55.471 --> 01:50:56.052]  So what they're doing
[01:51:02.296 --> 01:51:10.960]  Look, again, when I was a young guy, like I said earlier, there were no chains.
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:13.181]  They were all stores.
[01:51:13.181 --> 01:51:19.523]  And if you worked in a drugstore or a grocery store, you'd say, you know, I think I want to do one of these one day.
[01:51:19.523 --> 01:51:20.864]  No more.
[01:51:20.864 --> 01:51:26.466]  Every time, Owen, every time I go into a Home Depot,
[01:51:27.407 --> 01:51:29.188]  A Lowe's.
[01:51:29.188 --> 01:51:40.575]  Anytime I go into any of these chain stores, which I try to avoid, my heart breaks when I see the people working there and knowing that they have absolutely no future.
[01:51:40.575 --> 01:51:42.036]  Amazon trucks?
[01:51:42.036 --> 01:51:43.957]  They didn't exist five years ago.
[01:51:43.957 --> 01:51:46.839]  Oh, by the way, what do we spend?
[01:51:46.839 --> 01:51:50.881]  A hundred and something, $20,000 to educate a person from kindergarten to K-12?
[01:51:54.722 --> 01:52:01.250]  And so they could get a job working for Amazon or FedEx.
[01:52:01.250 --> 01:52:03.813]  Look what this country's gone down to.
[01:52:03.813 --> 01:52:08.859]  So all they do is they want to give us nothing and steal everything.
[01:52:08.859 --> 01:52:09.860]  That's the bottom line.
[01:52:11.007 --> 01:52:29.636]  And the whole umbrella that they put this under is climate change, and they say, oh, you need to limit your carbon emissions, so just be a good slave, live in your pod, eat the bugs, don't drive a vehicle, don't get in an airplane, and I think that their plan overall is make life as miserable
[01:52:30.516 --> 01:52:31.656]  As possible.
[01:52:31.656 --> 01:52:36.978]  Make it as impossible as it can be to be financially successful.
[01:52:36.978 --> 01:52:39.118]  And you see some people already buying into that.
[01:52:39.118 --> 01:52:51.122]  So instead of saying, you know what, I recognize that it might be harder to live free these days because of economic stress, but I'd still rather live free than be a slave, where you see what I call it as I see it.
[01:52:51.122 --> 01:52:56.804]  I just see the American left accepting their slavery, just saying, no, I'll save the climate, I'll be a good slave.
[01:52:56.804 --> 01:52:58.204]  No, I'd much rather have
[01:52:58.664 --> 01:53:02.788]  Dangerous freedom than safe slavery.
[01:53:02.788 --> 01:53:07.132]  Again, as I said to you, nightlife is dead life.
[01:53:07.132 --> 01:53:11.255]  There's no... There used to be bands playing everywhere.
[01:53:11.255 --> 01:53:15.819]  You know, Van Morrison, he wanted to meet me.
[01:53:15.819 --> 01:53:20.804]  And I met him in September at the Forest Hills Stadium.
[01:53:21.909 --> 01:53:23.331]  And it was great.
[01:53:23.331 --> 01:53:35.366]  They went against Van Morrison because he condemned when they started shutting down every place and destroying the lives and livelihoods of the entertainment industry.
[01:53:35.366 --> 01:53:36.908]  People couldn't go out and play anymore.
[01:53:37.426 --> 01:53:38.367]  You were banned.
[01:53:38.367 --> 01:53:45.116]  Again, and just like they make up all this stupid stuff and people swallow it, stand six feet apart!
[01:53:45.116 --> 01:53:47.099]  The wind only blows exactly six feet!
[01:53:47.099 --> 01:53:48.340]  Wear your mask!
[01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:50.243]  Wear that mask!
[01:53:50.243 --> 01:53:54.248]  No, but you can take it off when you're eating and drinking in an airplane!
[01:53:54.248 --> 01:53:55.670]  What the hell's the matter with you?
[01:53:56.250 --> 01:54:03.895]  Because don't you know, Owen, that you can take it off when you're eating and drinking in an airplane because the COVID knows you're eating and drinking and it won't bother you.
[01:54:03.895 --> 01:54:04.816]  No, that's right, Gerald.
[01:54:04.816 --> 01:54:08.658]  And the COVID also has strict guidelines as far as timing is concerned.
[01:54:08.658 --> 01:54:16.604]  And so that's why they shut... Oh, you can be open till 8 o'clock p.m., but then you've got to shut down because we all know the virus goes crazy after 8.
[01:54:17.947 --> 01:54:24.975]  And when you walk into a restaurant, wear a mask, but when you sit down, you can take it off because the virus does not go a table length!
[01:54:24.975 --> 01:54:25.896]  It knows this, Joe.
[01:54:25.896 --> 01:54:27.858]  The virus has respect.
[01:54:27.858 --> 01:54:31.542]  Very, very smart virus.
[01:54:31.542 --> 01:54:36.808]  How about all those plexiglass shields with the virus never went under it or around it?
[01:54:37.861 --> 01:54:57.493]  No, but of course, if you remember, the first science, when they were really trying to get the people to be afraid, they released this video, you may recall, it was somebody in a grocery store aisle, and they're walking, pushing their cart, and they just go, and there's a cough, and then they have this spray from the cough, and it travels everywhere.
[01:54:57.793 --> 01:55:07.436]  It travels over the aisles, and through the counter, and through the aisle, and up through the ventilation of the air conditioning!
[01:55:07.436 --> 01:55:10.997]  Oh, but the plexiglass will save us, Gerald!
[01:55:10.997 --> 01:55:12.057]  Yeah, I know.
[01:55:12.057 --> 01:55:18.058]  And how about all those poor little kids that they had in these little tents playing instruments?
[01:55:18.058 --> 01:55:23.260]  I mean, you know, what I'm saying to you, Owen, the damage that this has done is incalculable.
[01:55:24.119 --> 01:55:26.761]  This society's going down big time.
[01:55:26.761 --> 01:55:29.564]  They suck the joy out of life.
[01:55:29.564 --> 01:55:31.546]  There's no fun in it.
[01:55:31.546 --> 01:55:46.239]  Again, you know, this country went from, you know, music was America's greatest export, from ragtime to swing to rock and roll to R&B to Motown, and now it's No Town, just one bad rap.
[01:55:47.043 --> 01:55:54.556]  And we gotta bring it back, and I'll tell you, I'm doing everything I can, and InfoWars is too, but I'll tell you what I think is needed.
[01:55:54.556 --> 01:55:56.098]  A renaissance.
[01:55:57.125 --> 01:56:09.209]  We have to go back to the true heart and soul of this country, when it was the land of opportunity, start putting the anti-trust laws back in place that prohibited the big Simone-ing everything.
[01:56:09.209 --> 01:56:14.531]  And little clowns like Jimmy Carter, the peanut farmer, allowed interstate banking.
[01:56:14.531 --> 01:56:16.271]  They weren't allowed to go interstate before.
[01:56:16.271 --> 01:56:18.132]  They were only intrastate.
[01:56:18.132 --> 01:56:20.573]  He did away with the usury laws.
[01:56:20.573 --> 01:56:22.713]  He deregulated the airline industry.
[01:56:22.713 --> 01:56:24.094]  Now the bigs own everything.
[01:56:24.674 --> 01:56:27.095]  Bill Clinton, the Glass-Steagall Act.
[01:56:27.095 --> 01:56:31.116]  Hey, they pay me $300 an hour with Goldman Sachs to B.S.
[01:56:31.116 --> 01:56:32.097]  You could get me B.S.
[01:56:32.097 --> 01:56:35.598]  for free all day long, which is called a payoff.
[01:56:35.598 --> 01:56:37.258]  We need a renaissance.
[01:56:37.258 --> 01:56:40.659]  Look at the style of everybody at InfoWars.
[01:56:40.659 --> 01:56:47.962]  Look how trot-hard InfoWars does to bring everything to its highest level, as we do with the Trends Journal.
[01:56:47.962 --> 01:56:49.883]  We need a renaissance.
[01:56:49.883 --> 01:56:53.844]  Ale Romana all'antica, the man of the Romans and the ancients, they said,
[01:56:54.684 --> 01:57:01.909]  After the Black Plague in Europe, when everything was destroyed, they realized, we're messing things up.
[01:57:01.909 --> 01:57:04.471]  We better go back to when it was good.
[01:57:04.471 --> 01:57:08.313]  Gerald Solente, always great to talk to you, Gerald.
[01:57:08.313 --> 01:57:10.735]  The Trends Journal, sign up for it.
[01:57:10.735 --> 01:57:14.417]  I go and get the Trends Journal from TrendsJournal.com.
[01:57:14.417 --> 01:57:15.698]  I've signed up for their email list.
[01:57:15.698 --> 01:57:19.401]  I get all their updates and keeping me ahead of the curve as well.
[01:57:19.401 --> 01:57:23.844]  Gerald, thanks so much for your time and your great expert analysis on this Sunday night.
[01:57:24.845 --> 01:57:28.929]  And thank you for what you're doing and all of the people at InfoWars.
[01:57:28.929 --> 01:57:31.371]  All right, there goes Gerald Cilente, folks.
[01:57:31.371 --> 01:57:34.414]  I'm telling you, I stay ahead with the Trends Journal.
[01:57:34.414 --> 01:57:38.018]  But also right here at InfoWars, folks, remember, shop at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:57:38.018 --> 01:57:40.981]  Big extended Tuesday special transmission.
[01:57:40.981 --> 01:57:45.085]  All right, Harrison Smith takes over on the other side of this short break at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:49.011 --> 01:57:55.235]  In early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[01:57:55.235 --> 01:58:03.619]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[01:58:03.619 --> 01:58:05.861]  So I thank you for your passion and support.
[01:58:05.861 --> 01:58:09.343]  Now that was a three coin series, the founding member coin.
[01:58:09.343 --> 01:58:14.766]  The final coin that we're putting out for a long time is the Teddy Roosevelt
[01:58:15.259 --> 01:58:20.122]  Man in the Arena coin exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
