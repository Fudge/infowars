[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.311]  While they're like, yeah, lockdowns are coming back, COVID restrictions are coming back, all over the news.
[00:00:04.551 --> 00:00:05.391]  But they're crazy.
[00:00:05.451 --> 00:00:07.352]  None of it's coming back, just accepted.
[00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:11.293]  It's so fundamental to steal the next election.
[00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:13.294]  It's so fundamental for their global ID.
[00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:15.795]  It's so fundamental for their cashless society.
[00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:21.257]  It's so fundamental to control our bodies that they just don't know what to do.
[00:00:21.877 --> 00:00:23.918]  They are in a full panic mode.
[00:00:28.832 --> 00:00:33.635]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:35.615]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:59.115]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:06.115]  Subscribe to our channel for more videos on Cinefix.
[00:01:06.312 --> 00:01:13.054]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWars and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:15.435]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:01:16.454 --> 00:01:23.454]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:23.454 --> 00:01:46.454]  [Music]
[00:01:46.454 --> 00:01:52.454]   In 1972, The Limits to Growth was published by the Club of Rome.
[00:01:52.653 --> 00:01:58.915]  The book suggested that swift human depopulation would save the planet.
[00:01:58.975 --> 00:02:05.737]  In 2018, The Limits to Growth co-author Dennis Meadows explained how we need to murder billions of people.
[00:02:06.057 --> 00:02:13.059]  The planet can support something like a billion people.
[00:02:15.394 --> 00:02:21.338]  Maybe two billion, depending on how much liberty and how much material consumption you want to have.
[00:02:21.358 --> 00:02:26.962]  If you want more liberty and more consumption, you have to have fewer people.
[00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:37.867]   And conversely, if you have more people, I mean, we could even have Eight or nine billion, probably, if we have a very strong dictatorship, which is smart.
[00:02:38.668 --> 00:02:41.090]  Unfortunately, you never have smart dictatorships.
[00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.090]  They're always stupid.
[00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.193]  But if you had a smart dictatorship and a low standard of living, you could have it.
[00:02:46.993 --> 00:02:49.635]  But we want to have freedom and we want to have a high sentence.
[00:02:49.995 --> 00:02:51.296]  So we're going to have a billion people.
[00:02:51.737 --> 00:02:52.597]  And we're now at seven.
[00:02:53.238 --> 00:02:54.218]  So we have to get back down.
[00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:02.564]  I hope that this can be slow, relatively slow, and that it can be done in a way which is relatively equal.
[00:03:03.164 --> 00:03:04.886]  Overpopulation is a lie.
[00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:12.734]  With old-school sustainable farming and the end of big government, there is enough room on this planet for several billion.
[00:03:13.354 --> 00:03:19.020]  And while the Earth's climate does change, most of what we are seeing is contrived.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:27.567]  The fires breaking out all across the world are being blamed on climate change, even though hundreds of arsonists have been caught starting them.
[00:03:27.948 --> 00:03:32.992]  Most recently, 79 people were arrested for starting fires in Greece.
[00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:43.539]   Direct energy weapons, or DEWS, ...are able to start fires from above and can utilize microwave technology to burn homes from within.
[00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.802]  In 2013, the mainstream media reported that we were able to make rain and lightning.
[00:03:49.822 --> 00:03:51.202]  I mean, lasers?
[00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:51.963]  Really?
[00:03:52.083 --> 00:03:52.963]  To change the weather?
[00:03:53.223 --> 00:03:57.605]  By firing trillion-watt lasers, you rip apart the electrons, creating what are called ions.
[00:03:57.925 --> 00:04:03.108]  And these ions act like seeds, like dust particles, bringing down rain and even lightning.
[00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:08.451]  This week in Michigan, residents reported a strange strobe-like lightning.
[00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:14.334]  The event was captured on weather radar, which showed a very unnatural-looking spiral.
[00:04:15.895 --> 00:04:18.096]  That's some conspiracy theory shit right there.
[00:04:18.846 --> 00:04:23.129]  Making it rain has been possible for decades, and we have come a long way since then.
[00:04:23.489 --> 00:04:38.060]  With the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, known as HAARP, we can now create hurricanes, and we can control their direction with next-generation weather radar transmitters, known as NEXRAD.
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:51.688]  By building up an electromagnetic charge and dispersing it underground as direct current VLF waves, or very low frequency waves, the NEXRAD radar transmitters are able to trigger earthquakes.
[00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:55.410]  Earthquakes and explosives can trigger tsunamis.
[00:04:56.611 --> 00:05:02.252]  These are the technologies that we know of, and that only leaves volcanoes and tornadoes.
[00:05:03.212 --> 00:05:13.674]  Funded by Peter Thiel, AVE Tech Energy Corporation began work in 2012 on a device to produce a 130-foot-tall tornado.
[00:05:13.994 --> 00:05:14.895]  And a former U.S.
[00:05:14.955 --> 00:05:19.475]  intelligence officer recently told State of the Nation that the U.S.
[00:05:19.656 --> 00:05:21.536]  has already triggered a volcano.
[00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:30.158]  Climate change is not only a hoax, it's a depopulation program, and our entire government is going along with it.
[00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:34.119]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:43.119]  Well, my plate, ladies and gentlemen, is full.
[00:05:43.982 --> 00:05:46.083]  Like it's Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner.
[00:05:49.918 --> 00:05:54.082]  And a couple guests scheduled today, but we've rescheduled them for tomorrow.
[00:05:55.122 --> 00:06:02.969]  So that we got time to cover all this incredible news and take your phone calls on this live Monday, August 28th, 2023 transmission.
[00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:13.629]   2023 transmission. Well, even the government of Hawaii had to come out and admit that Blackrock
[00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:19.389]   that owned the power company did not update the power lines, did not cut back the trees,
[00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:25.310]  and left the power on, and that's what burned down Lahaina.
[00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:35.469]  But since then, we've learned even more, and the locals are calling it choreographed disaster, or choreographed mass murder.
[00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.192]  I've been calling it administrative mass murder.
[00:06:39.286 --> 00:06:46.452]  We have some of those locals coming on the show tomorrow, but they're too busy with disaster relief and helicopter missions to be on today.
[00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:56.801]  But if you watch the City Council and County Council meetings, it's like you're tuned into the show.
[00:06:57.201 --> 00:06:59.844]  The people are really awake, they're really informed.
[00:07:00.464 --> 00:07:06.810]  Democrats, climate change, blame game for Hawaii, fire confronted by reality after Maui identifies the cause.
[00:07:08.971 --> 00:07:09.571]  Power lines.
[00:07:11.593 --> 00:07:26.602]  If all the video they default didn't follow what any other power district in the country does, when 60 mile an hour winds hit, turn the power off.
[00:07:27.282 --> 00:07:28.743]  And when they subside, you turn it back on.
[00:07:29.543 --> 00:07:32.965]  Because it becomes a fire bomb if you don't.
[00:07:33.826 --> 00:07:36.708]  That's why the power always goes out when a bad hurricane hits your town.
[00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.174]  Folks live in Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Georgia.
[00:07:43.636 --> 00:07:44.116]  They know that.
[00:07:45.738 --> 00:07:48.000]  People that don't, don't understand that.
[00:07:48.941 --> 00:07:51.063]  But people in Hawaii, they get hit by high winds too.
[00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:55.408]  They get hit by typhoons and hurricanes, where they're at.
[00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.592]  Hurricanes spin one way, typhoons spin the other.
[00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:01.094]  It's the same thing though.
[00:08:03.505 --> 00:08:07.466]  Typhoons have been recorded going 200 miles an hour.
[00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:14.388]  And the fastest a hurricane's ever been recorded going is 160 miles an hour.
[00:08:14.408 --> 00:08:15.628]  So typhoons are worse.
[00:08:16.588 --> 00:08:25.010]  This was a hurricane coming up under Hawaii with another storm coming down hitting it to cause this.
[00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:39.052]  And it's unbelievable now that we have the eyewitness reports and the police admitting that they were told to block the town off on both ends, even though power lines were not yet even down on the main highway.
[00:08:39.533 --> 00:08:42.035]  And where they finally did fall down, they were not blocking traffic.
[00:08:43.797 --> 00:08:45.519]  The locals have said, let's not blame the police.
[00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:46.480]  They were following orders.
[00:08:48.243 --> 00:08:49.364]  The police are very upset.
[00:08:49.544 --> 00:08:50.704]  They just were told to do this.
[00:08:50.764 --> 00:08:51.505]  What are we supposed to do?
[00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:52.606]  They don't know.
[00:08:52.966 --> 00:08:53.886]  They're not omnipresent.
[00:08:54.146 --> 00:08:55.267]  I'm still blaming them some.
[00:08:55.847 --> 00:08:58.889]  But who really needs to get in trouble is the people that gave those orders.
[00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.832]  Because they couldn't give them all that ineptly, that perfectly.
[00:09:04.372 --> 00:09:04.912]  And that's why.
[00:09:04.932 --> 00:09:16.119]  The locals are calling it choreographed disaster.
[00:09:17.284 --> 00:09:21.346]  We've got some excerpts of some of what the locals are talking about now coming up.
[00:09:22.366 --> 00:09:29.389]  This is one of our top stories because not just because they're now estimating 1,500 to 2,000 children are missing.
[00:09:29.809 --> 00:09:30.769]  There's a cover-up of that.
[00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:40.013]  It's a Rosetta Stone or really a keyhole we can look through and get a wider view of how the globalists plan to shut down civilization.
[00:09:43.134 --> 00:09:51.881]   And speaking of that, I said this three years ago.
[00:09:51.961 --> 00:10:14.654]  I said when they give the pilots these COVID shots and a large percentage of them start having heart attacks and dying, they're going to say there's a pilot shortage and go to one pilot, which they've now introduced regulations to do, and they're finally going to move completely to AI pilots.
[00:10:17.396 --> 00:10:19.177]  Sure enough, it's all a big push.
[00:10:21.357 --> 00:10:23.839]  I've got a bunch of news articles that are pushing that today.
[00:10:23.859 --> 00:10:28.201]  So we're going to be laying all of this out.
[00:10:30.343 --> 00:10:38.368]  And that ties into a huge victory we've all had against tyranny that I want to talk about at the start of the next segment.
[00:10:40.029 --> 00:10:42.831]  And I came in this morning, it's so important, I shot a special report.
[00:10:43.882 --> 00:10:55.946]  That'll be done towards the end of the show today that will also air, that can go viral, that can be chocked full of all the video clips and documents and things because there's so many facets to this.
[00:10:57.046 --> 00:11:26.739]   We'll talk about it next segment but turns out three fact-checking groups came out and attacked me 10 days ago, 11 days ago, when I came out and said, I've talked to whistleblowers and they've been told middle of next month, they're going to start trying to phase in the COVID restrictions again, starting with the new vaccine on the 15th of September and new mask mandates and new vaccine mandates to go to school or college and more closures of events.
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.342]  All of it began to happen the afternoon after I reported it.
[00:11:31.863 --> 00:11:38.312]   I had no idea that I was I got the info on Tuesday, didn't nail it down until Thursday, just because I was busy.
[00:11:39.712 --> 00:11:42.494]  So I'd have been days ahead of it, but instead I was right under the wire.
[00:11:43.155 --> 00:11:48.018]  And then they opened up during the evening on all the channels, propagandizing the corporate media.
[00:11:49.239 --> 00:11:51.120]  And it was everything I said was coming.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.282]  Well, of course, it came right from the feds, who were just a few days ahead of the public.
[00:11:54.302 --> 00:11:55.743]  They had to tell them it was coming.
[00:11:57.224 --> 00:12:02.967]  So now we're in this paradox where they're admitting all this, and schools have closed in New York and Texas.
[00:12:04.113 --> 00:12:06.735]  Closed because of supposed COVID cases.
[00:12:07.396 --> 00:12:08.617]  The masks are all coming back.
[00:12:10.078 --> 00:12:12.801]  They're talking about having to have the shots to be able to get into stores.
[00:12:13.141 --> 00:12:19.107]  Biden put forward $1.4 billion to come out with a new booster that just so happens to match this variant.
[00:12:20.948 --> 00:12:22.089]  Now there's three more variants.
[00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:27.254]  And Biden talked to the press when he was in Nevada a few days ago.
[00:12:27.274 --> 00:12:28.275]  We'll play that clip coming up.
[00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:37.352]  And he says, oh yeah, this time it works and everybody needs to take it and it's going to protect you.
[00:12:39.673 --> 00:12:41.594]  First time you fool me, shame on you.
[00:12:41.634 --> 00:12:42.674]  Second time, shame on me.
[00:12:43.394 --> 00:12:47.636]  Well, they never fooled me when it came to this because I know how bad they were, but a lot of the public's awake now.
[00:12:47.656 --> 00:12:48.496]  So I'm going to put up with this.
[00:12:48.556 --> 00:13:00.943]   So they've had the, CDC, the TSA, and the Biden administration all come out and say Alex Jones is full of crap.
[00:13:01.843 --> 00:13:04.324]  Nobody's trying to bring back COVID restrictions of any type.
[00:13:05.944 --> 00:13:10.286]  While their very agencies say, no, we're looking at bringing them back and I have the articles.
[00:13:11.186 --> 00:13:17.428]  So they want to be able to incrementally bring this out so that you never form opposition to it.
[00:13:18.768 --> 00:13:19.968]  Successful approximation.
[00:13:20.468 --> 00:13:22.069]  So we don't have a debate about it beforehand.
[00:13:23.063 --> 00:13:24.486]  They want to sneak up behind us.
[00:13:25.408 --> 00:13:27.533]  While I'm watching my sex, I'm watching your sex.
[00:13:28.866 --> 00:13:30.787]  And you're watching my six as well.
[00:13:30.907 --> 00:13:32.008]  Together, we're going to beat this.
[00:13:32.688 --> 00:13:34.229]  And they are royally pissed.
[00:13:34.889 --> 00:13:37.631]  And I do need prayer because I'm not a macho guy.
[00:13:37.671 --> 00:13:38.611]  I do this because I have to.
[00:13:38.671 --> 00:13:39.511]  It's the right thing to do.
[00:13:39.531 --> 00:13:42.973]  I don't enjoy facing danger for no reason.
[00:13:43.373 --> 00:13:48.856]  There's a big reason to do this, but this is the type of stuff will get them to go ahead and finally kill me or set me up or something.
[00:13:48.896 --> 00:13:50.457]  So I do want to stay in the game.
[00:13:50.477 --> 00:13:55.159]  I need your prayers, please, because we we scored together.
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.161]  The audience of activists, you spread the word Friday morning.
[00:13:59.594 --> 00:14:05.357]  And then them going viral, and then six hours later they opened up with their propaganda campaign.
[00:14:07.277 --> 00:14:08.118]  It was perfect timing.
[00:14:08.158 --> 00:14:09.778]  I mean, we hit a hole in one on that.
[00:14:09.838 --> 00:14:13.160]  We slammed their brains out, basically.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.481]  I mean, we piledrove them politically.
[00:14:17.902 --> 00:14:20.083]  And they are royal pissed.
[00:14:20.603 --> 00:14:21.483]  Royal pissed.
[00:14:22.284 --> 00:14:23.404]  So, this is all God.
[00:14:24.105 --> 00:14:24.745]  I get no credit.
[00:14:25.762 --> 00:14:26.322]  It's all God.
[00:14:26.342 --> 00:14:37.171]  It's like, you don't get the credit either, but you care, you took action, God appreciates you, but it's, God has to work through us, this is all God, because you don't get a hole in one, you know, you don't have timing like this on yourself.
[00:14:37.551 --> 00:14:39.653]  Anybody thinks this is us is delusional, it's God.
[00:14:40.113 --> 00:14:42.615]  But, praise God, devastating.
[00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:44.197]  Devastating.
[00:14:45.737 --> 00:14:48.740]  I mean, it's like doing an uppercut and breaking somebody's jaw in three places.
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.641]  I mean, it is just, it is.
[00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:54.885]  We literally beat the living shit out of the New World Order politically.
[00:14:55.405 --> 00:14:55.905]  We'll be right back.
[00:14:55.926 --> 00:14:57.967]  Stay with us at fullwars.com tomorrow, Tuesday.
[00:14:57.987 --> 00:14:59.869]  All right, folks.
[00:14:59.909 --> 00:15:08.296]  This is really hardcore information because it's proven truth that has devastated the enemy.
[00:15:12.386 --> 00:15:31.244]  It'd be kind of like if you, to use a hunting analogy, shot a big old stag, a big old buck deer with an arrow, and it shoots right through the stag and embeds in a hill 100 yards away, and you go and get that arrow and are able to use it again, it's got special value.
[00:15:32.935 --> 00:15:35.156]  We know this arrow hunts.
[00:15:35.737 --> 00:15:37.698]  This is a lucky arrow that you're able to get back.
[00:15:38.318 --> 00:15:42.880]  The secret of most arrows is bows are so high-powered, you shoot through animals.
[00:15:42.961 --> 00:15:44.081]  Wild hogs, you name it.
[00:15:44.341 --> 00:15:45.342]  You hardly ever find them.
[00:15:46.683 --> 00:15:54.327]  I once shot through a buffalo with a compound bow at 50, 60 yards.
[00:15:54.427 --> 00:15:56.588]  Shot it side-on through the heart, through the lungs.
[00:15:58.169 --> 00:15:59.930]  Ran about 20 feet, fell over dead.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.461]  Looked like a geyser of blood shooting up his nose.
[00:16:04.902 --> 00:16:06.743]  Delicious meat by the way, had it butchered and ate it.
[00:16:07.843 --> 00:16:09.644]  And couldn't find the arrow.
[00:16:11.485 --> 00:16:18.368]  One time I did shoot a buck at about 100 yards and the arrow went right through it and it embedded in a hill about 50 yards away.
[00:16:18.828 --> 00:16:22.050]  But I'm going off into hunting analogies and I apologize, I shouldn't be doing that.
[00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:24.311]  Don't have time to hunt these days.
[00:16:27.495 --> 00:16:31.997]  They're going to continue to try to roll out these protocols, but they don't want us resisting them while they do it.
[00:16:32.518 --> 00:16:38.761]  So they gaslight us and say, oh, nobody's trying to bring masks back.
[00:16:38.821 --> 00:16:40.602]  Nobody's trying to make you take a shot.
[00:16:41.502 --> 00:16:53.468]  When colleges all over the place are saying the masks are back on, hospitals all over the place, a bunch of elementary and middle schools are shutting down in Texas and New York and Arizona and a whole bunch of places.
[00:16:55.810 --> 00:17:11.399]   We've got Grocery store chains, and hospitals, and all these other facilities, as well as hotels, saying, no, employees, you gotta wear your mask.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.342]  You heard callers a week ago saying, oh, we just got told, now it's in the news, it's happening.
[00:17:16.862 --> 00:17:25.306]  So they flipped the light switch five hours after I talked about this on Friday, and they didn't do that because of us.
[00:17:25.606 --> 00:17:30.482]   They had this all pre-planned, all pre-loaded, Weeks before, it's sent to the stations.
[00:17:30.502 --> 00:17:31.463]  They've already scripted it.
[00:17:31.763 --> 00:17:32.704]  They've already practiced it.
[00:17:32.724 --> 00:17:35.066]  That's why it was whether it was CBS or NBC or Fox.
[00:17:35.086 --> 00:17:39.410]  It was the exact same garbage, exact same order, exact same script.
[00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:42.233]  You've all seen the compilation videos where they do that.
[00:17:43.934 --> 00:17:51.702]  But here's the bad news, and here's some footage that, uh... I think it was Breitbart got this, but...
[00:17:52.844 --> 00:17:59.889]  They're now in New York in places setting up the COVID systems again, and the little cages around the hospitals.
[00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:18.943]  So they can have people in hazmat gear out there doing their little theater dance, telling you the hospital's overwhelmed and totally full, while it's almost totally empty, and the nurses and people are dancing around doing TikTok videos, and then they're keeping families away from their beloved ones that are being murdered.
[00:18:20.146 --> 00:18:24.929]  So, everything we saw three and a half years ago, they're trying again.
[00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:48.424]  But the good news is, we came out and pointed it out, you pointed it out, and so now it is a massive, massive, massive story, and they're simultaneously trying to roll it out and get the sheep to get in line, but they don't want to have another fight with us politically, because we just won the last one.
[00:18:49.448 --> 00:18:53.311]  They know the courts are on our side now, the public's awake now, to a great extent.
[00:18:54.732 --> 00:19:09.202]  So by stealth, quasi-stealth, they want to just roll it out in their blue cities, have their mind control victims going to the control, but they don't want to stir up those of us that are awake so that we speak up and say no.
[00:19:11.135 --> 00:19:11.775]  And that's the answer.
[00:19:11.795 --> 00:19:23.640]  When people bully you to wear a mask, or bully you to take a shot, you need to politely, but in a focused way, get back in their face, educate them, which an employee, call for a manager, and make a big scene out of it.
[00:19:25.841 --> 00:19:27.121]  So let's go through some of these headlines.
[00:19:27.661 --> 00:19:34.324]  Conspiracy theorists spread false information about the return of COVID-19 mandates, says the Associated Press.
[00:19:36.954 --> 00:19:41.798]  And of course the AP has its director previously on the board of Pfizer.
[00:19:42.678 --> 00:19:46.201]  Same thing with the head of Reuters is on the board of Pfizer.
[00:19:47.542 --> 00:19:54.347]  They don't tell you that and they go on to attack me and say that there's no such announcement the TSA says that's coming.
[00:19:56.409 --> 00:19:59.851]  So see now we've cornered them because that did come from high-level TSA.
[00:20:01.152 --> 00:20:04.075]  But now they don't want to give credibility to us saying it was coming.
[00:20:05.185 --> 00:20:06.946]  Because they want to be able to roll it out the way they want.
[00:20:07.527 --> 00:20:09.448]  They're having to then hold off on their plan.
[00:20:09.989 --> 00:20:12.210]  This is exactly how you stop them.
[00:20:12.851 --> 00:20:14.572]  This is the methodology of truth.
[00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:16.694]  It's the power of the whistleblower.
[00:20:17.034 --> 00:20:18.595]  It's the power of getting ahead of things.
[00:20:19.015 --> 00:20:21.437]  It's the power of realizing they're attacking us incrementally.
[00:20:21.878 --> 00:20:32.986]  So you've got to, when they come out incrementally, go A leads to Z. And explain to people the compendium of the operation.
[00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:38.155]  And people have already been through this once, so they know you're telling the truth.
[00:20:38.596 --> 00:20:42.338]  So they're like, oh, OK, they just said we should all wear masks again.
[00:20:42.378 --> 00:20:43.659]  I bet they cancel school next.
[00:20:43.959 --> 00:20:44.960]  Oh, next day, cancel school.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.401]  Oh, they cancel school.
[00:20:46.921 --> 00:20:48.903]  Next, they're going to say a new shot's coming out.
[00:20:49.383 --> 00:21:00.771]  Oh, five days after I said they've been told that on the 15th of September, the TSA has the masks back on themselves.
[00:21:02.025 --> 00:21:04.306]  And that Biden will then announce a new vaccine.
[00:21:05.927 --> 00:21:06.967]  That was not in the news then.
[00:21:08.908 --> 00:21:17.672]  Five days later, or I guess six days later, it was Friday when he did it, Biden comes out and says, we got a new vaccine that covers this.
[00:21:19.974 --> 00:21:20.734]  A red shot, please.
[00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:32.992]   UMass Memorial reinstates staff mandates after dramatic increase in COVID cases.
[00:21:33.889 --> 00:21:34.309]  Look at this.
[00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:40.194]  Biden administration eyes mid-September for new COVID-19 booster shot rollout.
[00:21:41.275 --> 00:21:42.897]  That just broke on Friday.
[00:21:43.477 --> 00:21:43.737]  U.S.
[00:21:43.757 --> 00:21:44.558]  News and World Report.
[00:21:45.439 --> 00:21:46.720]  Talk about nailing it.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:52.445]  Yeah, because they were senior TSA managers in a meeting with their boss.
[00:21:54.807 --> 00:21:58.030]  You know where there's only like one manager per shift?
[00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:02.881]  And they're all in there, and they're talking to the boss on the Zoom.
[00:22:04.922 --> 00:22:11.746]  They didn't tell me what meeting software, but there they are telling hundreds of managers of 47,000 employees what they were about to do.
[00:22:13.607 --> 00:22:15.668]  That's exactly what they did.
[00:22:17.068 --> 00:22:24.428]   CDC denies COVID restrictions coming after bombshell Alex Jones explosive Biden lockdown plan.
[00:22:24.428 --> 00:22:35.709]   Again, CDC denies COVID restrictions coming after bombshell Alex Jones exclusive
[00:22:35.709 --> 00:22:38.828]  exposed Biden's lockdown plan.
[00:22:39.016 --> 00:22:43.759]  Biden to fund new COVID vaccine for everybody, whether they've gotten it before or not.
[00:22:44.299 --> 00:22:45.720]  But he says this time it works.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.701]  We'll play the video when we come back.
[00:22:49.322 --> 00:22:51.343]  So they've got a real problem on their hands.
[00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:55.305]  This blew up in their face about as bad as it could.
[00:22:56.686 --> 00:23:00.315]   I give this about a I'll put it this way.
[00:23:00.875 --> 00:23:03.556]  We've never had something this successful to thwart the enemy.
[00:23:04.096 --> 00:23:08.938]  I mean, this is, this is, this is praise God stuff.
[00:23:08.978 --> 00:23:11.219]  This is past the ammunition and the info war.
[00:23:12.019 --> 00:23:14.080]  But it wouldn't have happened if you wouldn't have spread the word, folks.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.260]  So you get the temporal credit.
[00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:27.217]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[00:23:27.717 --> 00:23:41.829]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:45.713]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum through full space.
[00:23:46.073 --> 00:23:50.154]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[00:23:50.394 --> 00:23:54.376]  What we envisioned a hundred years ago, twenty years ago, is now reality.
[00:23:55.196 --> 00:24:11.301]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[00:24:11.501 --> 00:24:12.241]  InfoWars.
[00:24:12.601 --> 00:24:13.502]  Tomorrow's News.
[00:24:13.782 --> 00:24:14.062]  Today.
[00:24:17.776 --> 00:24:22.776]   Alright, so the reason the globalists want us off air, and that means this whole family of listeners and crew...
[00:24:22.776 --> 00:24:30.776]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:24:31.382 --> 00:24:40.146]  The reason they want us off air is they don't want us challenging the narratives they roll out for their global de-industrialization collapse of civilization plan.
[00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:43.988]  And that's why it's a life and death situation.
[00:24:44.008 --> 00:24:56.208]   That's why I'm so thankful to all of you For listening to me two Fridays ago and getting that big story out, then the enemy launched their operation that same day in the afternoon, and it just blew up in their face.
[00:24:59.049 --> 00:25:03.409]  It absolutely blew up in their face.
[00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:09.091]  And it's really hurt their global rollout of hysteria and fear.
[00:25:12.054 --> 00:25:21.701]  They're still pushing for new lockdowns and more mask and force injections and new poison boosters while they're saying it doesn't exist at the same time.
[00:25:26.304 --> 00:25:27.885]  This is not going to work for them now.
[00:25:29.386 --> 00:25:31.748]  So I am extremely pleased.
[00:25:32.749 --> 00:25:34.030]  I'm extremely satisfied.
[00:25:35.411 --> 00:25:39.734]  But I wish somebody else would have broke this.
[00:25:41.516 --> 00:25:50.682]  Because it's almost always us that's at the very tip of the spear that's the game changer that brings in the new awareness and that's what makes this job so dangerous.
[00:25:50.982 --> 00:25:53.864]  And I don't say that to brag or try to sound important.
[00:25:53.884 --> 00:25:54.684]  The enemy knows that.
[00:25:55.425 --> 00:26:08.466]   I want listeners to realize how important you are supporting this operation because that's the way God's got it that most of the time, other than like a Project Veritas, It was just incredible, and you saw what they've been through.
[00:26:08.486 --> 00:26:14.170]  The Feds, and the arrests, and the infiltrations, and we got all the same crap going on here.
[00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:17.833]  I just want you to know, we are doing some dangerous stuff here.
[00:26:18.934 --> 00:26:24.579]  And I just appreciate you knowing that, and I don't want your thanks, I want your support.
[00:26:25.179 --> 00:26:26.000]  I need your support.
[00:26:28.542 --> 00:26:32.325]  Use another military analogy, non-violently as an analogy.
[00:26:33.851 --> 00:26:41.375]  We could be a 2,000-pound cruise missile warhead with an armored tip on it designed to go into some enemy bunker and take out their general staff.
[00:26:43.776 --> 00:26:51.519]  But if you don't have the fuel that's two-thirds of that missile, it's not going to be able to fly 1,000 miles and hit its target.
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:27:03.045]  So what's more important, the warhead in the missile, the avionics in the missile, or the fuel?
[00:27:05.319 --> 00:27:07.240]  And the truth is, they're all just as important.
[00:27:09.882 --> 00:27:12.063]  That's what I keep trying to hammer through people's brains.
[00:27:12.504 --> 00:27:14.865]  But you're not just the fuel when you support us.
[00:27:15.466 --> 00:27:16.426]  You're the eyes and ears.
[00:27:16.947 --> 00:27:17.887]  You're the avionics.
[00:27:18.808 --> 00:27:20.729]  You're the ground tracking radar.
[00:27:20.769 --> 00:27:21.670]  You're the GPS.
[00:27:24.008 --> 00:27:40.941]  And you're the explosive force on the ground to stand up and to boycott and to boycott and to pray to God and to vote and to file lawsuits and to educate your children right and to grow good produce and to help your neighbors and a thousand other things.
[00:27:43.743 --> 00:27:44.343]  You're the fuel.
[00:27:46.125 --> 00:27:46.985]  You're the avionics.
[00:27:49.627 --> 00:27:50.508]  You're the explosive.
[00:27:54.557 --> 00:27:56.597]  And really, if you pull back, you're not the missile at all.
[00:27:58.858 --> 00:28:07.700]  You're the missile controller sitting thousands of miles away at their desk in control of the whole thing.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.261]  And I want that to sink in.
[00:28:17.482 --> 00:28:26.677]   And I want you to recognize That if they go ahead and just flatten me for this, that that's okay.
[00:28:27.098 --> 00:28:30.460]  That'll be a big exclamation point on what we just did.
[00:28:30.781 --> 00:28:39.908]  Because I don't think even the crew or any of the listeners, even myself, get how big this was 10 days ago.
[00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:44.450]  I saw Steve Bannon call it the scoop of a lifetime.
[00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:51.450]  Jack Posobiec.
[00:28:52.456 --> 00:28:53.656]  I was like, yeah, it's big.
[00:28:54.096 --> 00:28:55.276]  We knew it was already rolling out.
[00:28:55.957 --> 00:29:02.959]  Okay, our source is great, but it's the way they started denying it that just blew up even bigger.
[00:29:03.479 --> 00:29:07.720]  While they're like, yeah, lockdowns are coming back, COVID restrictions are coming back, all over the news.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.741]  But they're crazy, none of it's coming back, just accepted.
[00:29:12.017 --> 00:29:14.700]  It's so fundamental to steal the next election.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.701]  It's so fundamental for their global ID.
[00:29:17.022 --> 00:29:19.224]  It's so fundamental for their cashless society.
[00:29:19.244 --> 00:29:30.214]  It's so fundamental to control our bodies that they just don't know what to do.
[00:29:30.835 --> 00:29:32.896]  They are in a full panic mode.
[00:29:37.321 --> 00:29:49.201]   So, It's not about a victory lap for everybody to say, oh, we did a great job.
[00:29:49.862 --> 00:29:52.443]  It's about, no, the enemy's not invincible.
[00:29:52.463 --> 00:29:53.304]  They're not all powerful.
[00:29:53.704 --> 00:29:54.985]  And I'll use another military analogy.
[00:29:55.005 --> 00:29:55.546]  World War II.
[00:29:56.146 --> 00:29:57.267]  Radar was just getting invented.
[00:29:58.067 --> 00:30:04.012]  The British knew when German planes were coming, but Germany didn't really have radar and our aircraft didn't have radar.
[00:30:05.553 --> 00:30:08.315]  So they're flying in over Germany or Italy.
[00:30:09.946 --> 00:30:15.829]  To drop bombs, the Army Air Corps, you know they fly towards the flak.
[00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:16.929]  That's saying you're over the target.
[00:30:16.969 --> 00:30:17.710]  That's an old saying.
[00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.430]  You're getting the flak when you're over the target.
[00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:25.393]  But more importantly, they had spotters and the bombardier.
[00:30:26.914 --> 00:30:35.738]  Their job when targeting and looking at maps they had and trying to guide in by eye, that's hard on the plane of what factories to hit or bridges to hit or things they're supposed to hit.
[00:30:38.672 --> 00:30:42.515]  Was to mark down where they got big explosions.
[00:30:42.896 --> 00:30:52.343]  Even if the bomb missed, it might have created a huge explosion, because really the Germans had stuff in another warehouse, or maybe underground, and, oh, we got a big explosion here.
[00:30:52.584 --> 00:30:53.484]  Hit that again.
[00:30:53.865 --> 00:30:54.966]  That's obviously valuable.
[00:30:56.507 --> 00:31:00.971]  And so that's what we're doing here, is we're like, this really blew up big, folks.
[00:31:02.792 --> 00:31:04.814]  I mean, big, spectacular explosion.
[00:31:07.052 --> 00:31:13.797]  And we need to circle back around a lot and hit this target again and again and again and again and again and again and again.
[00:31:14.912 --> 00:31:24.617]  Because again, if they can't roll out their propaganda and have us just react to it, I know for most listeners, you're like, Jones, we knew that before you were born.
[00:31:24.877 --> 00:31:25.518]  Will you quit?
[00:31:26.558 --> 00:31:28.880]  This show is not for those of you that know more than I do.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.400]  I know there's a lot.
[00:31:30.801 --> 00:31:31.261]  You understand that?
[00:31:31.761 --> 00:31:34.783]  This show is for the general public that's tuning in.
[00:31:35.303 --> 00:31:38.044]  I want them to get it through their brain.
[00:31:39.265 --> 00:31:43.789]  Because if this show was just about entertainment, man, I got so many entertaining clips.
[00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:49.293]  I got the leftists trying to block the road to Burning Man and the police running them over.
[00:31:49.313 --> 00:31:50.855]  I could watch it all day.
[00:31:53.257 --> 00:31:55.018]  I got probably 30 clips just as good.
[00:31:56.079 --> 00:31:58.321]  Would listeners rather me just give you entertainment?
[00:31:59.565 --> 00:32:03.308]  Because I would enjoy the show more, quite frankly, if I just sat back and showed police.
[00:32:04.108 --> 00:32:09.051]  Because they wouldn't pull down the barricade, they'd jump in front of the vehicle, so the police just went ahead and ran through it.
[00:32:10.352 --> 00:32:18.438]  And the point is, there's 20 miles of people backed up, with their cars overheating, and people basically about to die in the desert because of these terrorists.
[00:32:20.979 --> 00:32:22.320]  And this is how the police should act.
[00:32:23.901 --> 00:32:27.704]  But see, it's tribal police, so they don't have to be politically correct.
[00:32:32.449 --> 00:32:37.271]  So, you know, I could just come back.
[00:32:38.172 --> 00:32:40.693]  Maybe I should just come back for the whole show and just play fun clips.
[00:32:42.134 --> 00:32:43.475]  But I don't think you want me to do that.
[00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:45.496]  Because you want to win, right?
[00:32:45.536 --> 00:32:46.396]  You want to beat these people.
[00:32:47.076 --> 00:32:48.317]  We got a war game this.
[00:32:48.357 --> 00:32:49.578]  We got to talk about how we beat them.
[00:32:49.798 --> 00:32:51.358]  We got to stop the next lockdown.
[00:32:52.199 --> 00:32:53.059]  And we know how to do it.
[00:32:53.099 --> 00:32:54.100]  We just had a major victory.
[00:32:54.932 --> 00:32:57.734]  So I'm going to get to these clips and finish up this hour on this.
[00:32:58.174 --> 00:32:59.175]  Then I'll hit all the other news.
[00:32:59.555 --> 00:33:00.476]  Take your calls and more.
[00:33:00.856 --> 00:33:02.498]  Infowars.com to Mars News today.
[00:33:03.058 --> 00:33:06.721]  All right, I've spent a lot of time on this the first hour, and I think roughly so.
[00:33:07.922 --> 00:33:13.005]  They were planning, and they already are doing it, to roll out their new incremental COVID lockdowns.
[00:33:13.666 --> 00:33:23.073]  They even said, with different universities and public schools, just 14 days to flatten the curve.
[00:33:25.888 --> 00:33:29.029]  You say, why would they use the same fake script again?
[00:33:29.049 --> 00:33:34.791]  Using the same fake script again because it worked for a while last time.
[00:33:36.932 --> 00:33:39.193]  And they want mail-in ballots again next year.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:42.094]  People say, wow, they're going to push it all the way to next year?
[00:33:43.074 --> 00:33:44.655]  They pushed it over two years before.
[00:33:44.675 --> 00:33:46.235]  This is just less than a year.
[00:33:46.255 --> 00:33:53.198]  The mail-in ballots are going to go out in September and October.
[00:33:54.599 --> 00:34:02.784]  And they've got all these federal purchase orders, after I covered this, that literally came out a few days after we broke it, saying, oh, guess what?
[00:34:03.464 --> 00:34:15.410]  Middle of September, all these federal agencies need millions and millions of dollars apiece in PPE, in the mask, in the sanitizer, in all of it.
[00:34:15.771 --> 00:34:17.111]  Yes, it's going on.
[00:34:19.513 --> 00:34:23.355]  And again, we are having a debate about it up front, saying, no thank you.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:36.054]  It'd be like if you didn't want to go to Peto Run Disney World, and you live out in California, and your wife gets you and the kids in the car and says, I have a surprise for you.
[00:34:37.756 --> 00:34:38.997]  For your, say, 40th birthday.
[00:34:39.737 --> 00:34:41.819]  You're like, okay, we're going to Steakhouse, or what are we doing?
[00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:43.360]  We're going to the Breadwoods?
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.861]  Your wife says, you'll see.
[00:34:45.221 --> 00:34:49.483]  So you drive out of LA, and you drive out toward, and all of a sudden you get closer to Disneyland.
[00:34:49.924 --> 00:34:52.645]  You're on the highway, and you go, we're not going to Disneyland, are we?
[00:34:53.106 --> 00:34:54.747]  Oh, no, no, we're not going to Disneyland.
[00:34:55.447 --> 00:34:59.450]  But she knows the kids are going to go once you get in the parking lot.
[00:35:01.031 --> 00:35:07.926]   And then once you get to the parking lot, Dad's gonna go, "Okay, I'll go and watch the bearded men
[00:35:07.926 --> 00:35:12.466]   dressed in princess outfits across my daughters."
[00:35:12.466 --> 00:35:22.365]   Now that's a good analogy because my wife hates the system, but she still feels like,
[00:35:22.365 --> 00:35:26.365]   "Well, our six-year-old, you know, it's a right of passage to go to Disney World, Disneyland."
[00:35:26.433 --> 00:35:27.354]  I'm like, no, it's not.
[00:35:27.974 --> 00:35:29.715]  Over my dead body, we're never going.
[00:35:29.755 --> 00:35:31.115]  And she's like, I guess you're right.
[00:35:31.135 --> 00:35:33.316]  But there's still this thing.
[00:35:34.594 --> 00:35:38.660]  So let's go back to the COVID shots, or the lockdowns, or the masks, or any of it.
[00:35:40.483 --> 00:35:46.592]  They want to get us in the car and get us there before we have a debate about where we're going.
[00:35:48.315 --> 00:35:56.944]   Instead, I don't really snoop around, but You guys, you know, got on the computer and saw the history, and it said Disneyland, and I saw tickets were bought.
[00:35:57.264 --> 00:35:58.705]  I mean, like, we're not going to Disneyland.
[00:35:59.045 --> 00:36:05.908]  In fact, I got on about six months ago on our desktop in the bedroom, and Disneyland was pulled up.
[00:36:06.628 --> 00:36:07.389]  This is a true story.
[00:36:08.169 --> 00:36:12.451]  And I walked out there and talked to my wife, and I said, we're not going to Disney World.
[00:36:13.371 --> 00:36:18.573]  She said, well, I just know we're going to Florida on a business trip, and I figured, I know it's all liberal, but you know, we should still have some fun.
[00:36:18.833 --> 00:36:21.214]  What, stand in line all day and fund some?
[00:36:21.294 --> 00:36:22.474]  No, we're not going.
[00:36:22.514 --> 00:36:24.995]  But see, that's called getting ahead of it.
[00:36:25.435 --> 00:36:31.877]  So we caught the wife with the Disneyland brochures and the Disneyland tickets.
[00:36:34.618 --> 00:36:35.998]  And we're saying, we're not going.
[00:36:36.338 --> 00:36:38.639]  And she's saying, or maybe the husband did it.
[00:36:38.659 --> 00:36:39.279]  I'm not blaming women.
[00:36:39.659 --> 00:36:40.320]  It's an allegory.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.060]  It's an analogy.
[00:36:43.629 --> 00:36:45.294]  She's like, okay, we're not going to Disneyland.
[00:36:46.076 --> 00:36:46.638]  But she has tickets.
[00:36:46.939 --> 00:36:48.865]  But it would sure be a fun place to go!
[00:36:51.725 --> 00:37:04.168]  You know, but we are putting masks on, and we do have a new shot, and we are locking things down, and we had told the corporations get ready for new lockdowns this winter, but nobody wants you to, there's no COVID changes, okay?
[00:37:04.327 --> 00:37:10.327]   Now Biden just signed a deal for 1.4 billion new shots and the government's buying up all
[00:37:10.327 --> 00:37:15.606]   the emergency gear and it's perfect timing for an election but it's not really going on.
[00:37:15.606 --> 00:37:25.047]  What is Disneyland, Disney World doing on the computer?
[00:37:25.261 --> 00:37:26.361]  So I don't really look at the history.
[00:37:26.461 --> 00:37:28.162]  I popped it open and it was just right there.
[00:37:28.642 --> 00:37:33.665]  And of course I had like a heart attack because literally you could torture me taking me to Disney World.
[00:37:34.125 --> 00:37:38.827]  When I was like 10 years old, my parents go, oh, let's go to Florida and let's go to Disney World.
[00:37:39.087 --> 00:37:39.868]  I hated it then.
[00:37:40.348 --> 00:37:41.889]  Two hours to ride a roller coaster?
[00:37:42.952 --> 00:37:45.273]  I can go to Six Flags and wait 30 minutes and ride one.
[00:37:45.573 --> 00:37:46.454]  That's still too long.
[00:37:47.274 --> 00:37:49.235]  Two hours to ride Magic Mountain?
[00:37:49.855 --> 00:37:50.095]  No.
[00:37:50.636 --> 00:37:51.216]  It sucks.
[00:37:52.076 --> 00:37:55.518]  You add a bunch of fat dudes in dresses running around.
[00:37:55.538 --> 00:38:02.822]  You might as well put me in a firing squad, but at least that won't kill you.
[00:38:02.842 --> 00:38:10.122]   But what is a firing squad is these shots and this medical tearing.
[00:38:10.122 --> 00:38:20.342]   So, because I mentioned it, let's play a clip of Biden three years ago saying you'll never
[00:38:20.342 --> 00:38:24.401]  have to take a shot again because one shot protects you.
[00:38:25.016 --> 00:38:28.699]  And then let's play his latest clip from Friday where he comes over to the press.
[00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:29.099]  Here it is.
[00:38:31.561 --> 00:38:35.664]  The various shots that people are getting now cover that.
[00:38:37.465 --> 00:38:38.065]  You're OK.
[00:38:38.305 --> 00:38:41.488]  You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:47.978]  Mr. President, can you say anything about the uptick of COVID cases and the new variant?
[00:38:48.098 --> 00:38:48.478]  Yes, I can.
[00:38:48.518 --> 00:38:53.221]  As a matter of fact, I signed off this morning on a proposal we have to present to the Congress a request for additional funding for a new vaccine.
[00:38:53.282 --> 00:38:53.822]  That is not necessary.
[00:38:53.882 --> 00:38:54.082]  That works.
[00:38:53.902 --> 00:39:00.902]   to present to the Congress a request for additional funding for a new vaccine.
[00:39:00.902 --> 00:39:03.902]  That is not necessary. That works.
[00:39:03.902 --> 00:39:10.902]   And tentatively, not decidedly yet, tentatively, it is recommended that,
[00:39:10.902 --> 00:39:15.902]   we would like to be recommended that everybody get it, no matter what they got before.
[00:39:15.902 --> 00:39:19.902]   So I know he's babbling and it's hard to understand him, but he said,
[00:39:19.902 --> 00:39:22.902]  "This time it works, and everybody should get it."
[00:39:23.872 --> 00:39:24.993]  Oh, and it's going to be free again.
[00:39:27.635 --> 00:39:30.617]  Really, they made $80 million at Pfizer alone last time.
[00:39:30.637 --> 00:39:33.660]  And over half that was the U.S.
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.061]  morons taking it.
[00:39:36.322 --> 00:39:38.683]  So to do the math, only $1.4 billion?
[00:39:39.044 --> 00:39:40.645]  No, most of these are being mandated.
[00:39:41.125 --> 00:39:44.908]  And last time I checked, a Moderna shot is $100.
[00:39:47.458 --> 00:39:49.199]  And a Pfizer shot's like 80 bucks.
[00:39:50.199 --> 00:39:52.160]  Guys, look up how much one of these shots is now.
[00:39:53.981 --> 00:40:03.485]  So, if the shots cost 80, 90 billion dollars, then how are we going to get them for 1.4 billion?
[00:40:04.025 --> 00:40:05.346]  Even if you want to take the poison.
[00:40:06.254 --> 00:40:09.978]  And the answer is no, it's a bonanza off of the insurance companies.
[00:40:10.598 --> 00:40:11.980]  Look, it just goes on and on.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.741]  I could talk for 10 hours about this.
[00:40:14.122 --> 00:40:19.026]  Republicans in nine Florida counties adopt resolution calling for ban on COVID vaccines.
[00:40:19.066 --> 00:40:19.787]  That's good news.
[00:40:20.608 --> 00:40:24.652]  I'm going to revisit this after I hit the other news, but I didn't get so prepared for this show.
[00:40:27.094 --> 00:40:28.576]  I got really prepared for this broadcast.
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:38.249]  So we're going to get everything else when we come back and start the next hour, including how they're planning to have AI take over the airlines.
[00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:41.293]  The latest on Trump, they're trying to disqualify him.
[00:40:41.313 --> 00:40:44.576]  We knew this was coming in New Hampshire and in Florida.
[00:40:44.616 --> 00:40:47.300]  The Democrats are talking about election meddling.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.501]  This is the next level.
[00:40:49.282 --> 00:40:59.873]   We're also going to get into Now, they're blaming climate change for the Maui fire, but even the government now admits it was the power lines and the fault of Black Rock.
[00:41:00.734 --> 00:41:02.875]  Also, they've arrested 79 people in Greece.
[00:41:03.375 --> 00:41:14.723]  The government says the major fires were caused by leftists who were out burning everything down, who were in the country with a cover story of being at an environmental conference.
[00:41:16.043 --> 00:41:16.544]  Remember that.
[00:41:17.084 --> 00:41:23.826]   Anywhere you have a smart conference, one of these UN-sponsored deals, By night, in high wind, they burn you down.
[00:41:23.846 --> 00:41:25.627]  By day, they drink alcohol and have sex.
[00:41:27.168 --> 00:41:30.211]  And people are already tracking this, so that's good news.
[00:41:32.673 --> 00:41:34.314]  These are armies of terrorists.
[00:41:34.835 --> 00:41:36.396]  They don't just block highways, folks.
[00:41:36.416 --> 00:41:39.238]  They don't just try to teach your son to have his penis cut off.
[00:41:39.799 --> 00:41:42.541]  They want to destroy everything, and they will if we let them.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:49.043]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really good news.
[00:41:49.884 --> 00:41:54.606]  Because it's a great product you love, and people want it, and it funds our operation of 360WIN.
[00:41:55.066 --> 00:42:10.094]   Body's ultimate turmeric formula, the strongest you're going to find anywhere, jam-packed, a big old giant bottle of stuff that destroys inflammation, that empowers your neurological system, that, you know, battles Cancer, you name it.
[00:42:10.134 --> 00:42:12.115]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[00:42:12.155 --> 00:42:15.137]  God gave it to us, and it's the strongest curcuminoid out there.
[00:42:15.617 --> 00:42:19.219]  Other leading brands are like 70% curcuminoid.
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.021]  Most brands are 5% coumadin.
[00:42:22.661 --> 00:42:24.342]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[00:42:24.682 --> 00:42:26.443]  This is the strongest anybody makes.
[00:42:27.504 --> 00:42:29.345]  95% curcuminoid.
[00:42:29.705 --> 00:42:30.846]  Look at this on the table.
[00:42:31.246 --> 00:42:32.247]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:42:32.667 --> 00:42:33.848]  Look at all these babies.
[00:42:34.528 --> 00:42:41.092]  You take a couple of these a day, that's a multi-month supply, and you are in like Flynn.
[00:42:41.832 --> 00:42:52.938]  No additives, no garbage, just turbocharged 95% cuminoid with a couple of other key amino acids that are known to supercharge it and upload it to your body.
[00:42:53.278 --> 00:42:54.659]  I am so glad this is back.
[00:42:55.842 --> 00:42:57.243]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[00:42:57.664 --> 00:42:59.726]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[00:43:00.607 --> 00:43:02.048]  Bobby's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:43:02.408 --> 00:43:03.890]  Back in stock, 25% off.
[00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:07.853]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:43:08.194 --> 00:43:13.719]  And by the way, that flash sale on X3 and Vitamineral Fusion, it ends today.
[00:43:14.099 --> 00:43:15.040]  It really is selling out.
[00:43:15.561 --> 00:43:16.221]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:16.061 --> 00:43:23.061]  Please stay with us.
[00:43:23.061 --> 00:43:38.221]  I need financing to fight the globalist.
[00:43:38.215 --> 00:43:39.696]  Plus, we've got great products you need.
[00:43:40.136 --> 00:43:40.937]  These are historic.
[00:43:41.417 --> 00:43:42.257]  They're one-of-a-kind.
[00:43:42.357 --> 00:43:44.378]  We sold out of Alex Jones for President shirt.
[00:43:44.839 --> 00:43:46.259]  Told you, these are all limited editions now.
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:57.265]  And we have a few of the Political Prisoner original mugshot, which is not the real mugshot, that you can get at infowarestore.com for $17.76.
[00:43:57.686 --> 00:44:03.959]   But what we do have being printed right now, Is the real Trump mugshot Never Surrender t-shirt.
[00:44:04.679 --> 00:44:06.341]  And on the front says Trump 2024.
[00:44:06.661 --> 00:44:08.462]  On the back it says Never Surrender.
[00:44:08.482 --> 00:44:09.483]  That's what he said yesterday.
[00:44:09.663 --> 00:44:11.224]  Infowars.com.
[00:44:11.344 --> 00:44:16.608]  So Trump 2024 in black and white and in gold with Never Surrender on the back.
[00:44:17.048 --> 00:44:19.590]  And that's a designer shirt, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:21.591]  High quality fabric, high quality printing.
[00:44:22.252 --> 00:44:25.834]  So when we're selling these for $17.76, we paid like $15 for these.
[00:44:26.875 --> 00:44:28.736]  So we're just selling that one almost at cost.
[00:44:29.197 --> 00:44:30.077]  It's almost gone.
[00:44:30.097 --> 00:44:36.097]   So the original limited edition political prisoner shirt that is not the accurate mug shot,
[00:44:36.097 --> 00:44:38.856]   something we came up with, but they were originally gonna do it and didn't.
[00:44:38.856 --> 00:44:42.557]  Then we now have the real mug shot.
[00:44:42.557 --> 00:44:44.776]  And if you want those, they're being printed right now.
[00:44:44.776 --> 00:44:48.656]   Anybody tells you you've got the shirt and it isn't a two week wait, it is full of it.
[00:44:48.656 --> 00:44:50.577]  We put the order in this morning.
[00:44:50.577 --> 00:44:52.897]  They'll be done in about a week and a half.
[00:44:52.897 --> 00:44:54.897]  They're making them right here in Texas.
[00:44:54.897 --> 00:44:55.976]  They'll be shipping out.
[00:44:55.976 --> 00:45:01.737]   So get your orders in now to get a piece of history, Trump 2024 in black and white,
[00:45:01.737 --> 00:45:05.536]   the real mug shot, never surrender on the back, Infowars.com.
[00:45:05.536 --> 00:45:07.456]  And we have the gold one as well.
[00:45:07.456 --> 00:45:10.977]   I think the gold will be the most popular, but we will see.
[00:45:11.244 --> 00:45:12.584]  All three shirts now available.
[00:45:12.904 --> 00:45:13.944]  The original, ready to ship.
[00:45:14.284 --> 00:45:15.765]  Limited edition, about to sell out.
[00:45:16.165 --> 00:45:17.645]  And we also have a flash sale of X3.
[00:45:17.785 --> 00:45:19.406]  Limited supply came in.
[00:45:19.526 --> 00:45:20.446]  And VitaMineral Fusion.
[00:45:20.766 --> 00:45:22.246]  Both are selling out very, very quickly.
[00:45:22.566 --> 00:45:24.187]  But despite that, they're 40% off.
[00:45:24.507 --> 00:45:26.047]  That's what finances this operation.
[00:45:26.067 --> 00:45:27.728]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:45:32.011 --> 00:45:35.395]  By the way, folks, there's no doubt that COVID's going back around.
[00:45:35.876 --> 00:45:38.018]  It is the synthetic nanotech attacking people.
[00:45:38.639 --> 00:45:46.389]  I've been tested twice for it, suppose you don't have it, but I've been around 49 years, and I barely ever get sick, but every three, four years, I know what it feels like.
[00:45:48.126 --> 00:45:50.067]  And this is what it felt like when I had it two years ago.
[00:45:50.608 --> 00:45:58.053]  But I'm almost through it, taking Ivermectin and the great products at InfoWarsLife.com as well, and InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:45:58.073 --> 00:46:01.936]  But man, I tell you, it is just crazy trying to be alive here.
[00:46:01.956 --> 00:46:06.900]  So I appreciate folks putting up with the fact that my voice is shot and I want to cough all the time.
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:12.243]  But I didn't just go off what the globalists said about COVID coming back.
[00:46:13.124 --> 00:46:16.907]  And their answer to it is to make it worse with the shots and blocking therapeutics.
[00:46:18.604 --> 00:46:20.165]  It's that I talked to the medical doctors.
[00:46:20.205 --> 00:46:21.326]  I talked to the clinic owners.
[00:46:21.386 --> 00:46:21.886]  I talked to them.
[00:46:21.906 --> 00:46:24.908]  We had Dr. Stella Emanuel on right before we broke all this news.
[00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:33.414]  And, you know, she is seeing it at her major clinics in Houston.
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:36.881]  A lot goes into it.
[00:46:36.982 --> 00:46:38.123]  They give us the injections.
[00:46:38.203 --> 00:46:39.024]  It mutates it.
[00:46:39.705 --> 00:46:41.527]  It creates all these other viruses.
[00:46:41.627 --> 00:46:42.628]  It lowers our immunity.
[00:46:43.149 --> 00:46:44.611]  Then other viruses can attack us.
[00:46:44.971 --> 00:46:45.612]  And I want to be clear.
[00:46:46.333 --> 00:46:47.594]  Some people say COVID doesn't exist.
[00:46:47.654 --> 00:46:48.275]  It's all fake.
[00:46:48.295 --> 00:46:49.717]  It's never been isolated.
[00:46:49.997 --> 00:46:51.379]  I'm not attacking those folks.
[00:46:51.459 --> 00:46:52.200]  It's just not true.
[00:46:54.884 --> 00:46:56.045]  It's 100% real.
[00:46:56.445 --> 00:46:57.366]  It's a nanotech.
[00:46:58.066 --> 00:47:01.348]  And if you have the proper things up front, you can deal with it and mitigate it.
[00:47:01.848 --> 00:47:03.590]  And it's much better to get it naturally.
[00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:06.271]  And your body does create some immunity to it.
[00:47:07.212 --> 00:47:11.515]  The shot obviously gives it to you, makes your body produce it, and it's absolutely horrible.
[00:47:12.475 --> 00:47:13.476]  But it's real.
[00:47:13.796 --> 00:47:15.077]  I mean, let me tell you.
[00:47:15.797 --> 00:47:17.538]  I mean, I get the flu or something.
[00:47:17.558 --> 00:47:18.299]  I just ignore it.
[00:47:18.639 --> 00:47:21.301]  I mean, I might get really sick every 10 years.
[00:47:22.898 --> 00:47:26.721]  And I got COVID after it almost killed my dad and robbed him.
[00:47:28.402 --> 00:47:29.162]  I mean, almost killed.
[00:47:29.923 --> 00:47:30.943]  I got it taken care of.
[00:47:32.204 --> 00:47:36.907]  And my wife's like, wow, you really are sick.
[00:47:37.568 --> 00:47:38.568]  What are you doing at 3 a.m.
[00:47:38.608 --> 00:47:39.449]  walking around the neighborhood?
[00:47:39.469 --> 00:47:40.610]  And I said, well, I can't breathe.
[00:47:42.785 --> 00:48:01.757]  And I was starting to take me that's now I remember I was feeling a lot better, but I still couldn't breathe the middle of night And I said if you had this you'd panic want to go to the hospital I said I've never felt like this it feels like I'm literally You know I did a little bit of wrestling growing up I've been in a few fights the guy starts choking you you feel that that that's what it felt like I said I get what people are panicking.
[00:48:01.777 --> 00:48:06.320]  This is really a Psychological weapon because it's not causing real damage to your tissue.
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.184]   It's causing inflammation like the Spanish flu did and I'm not a doctor.
[00:48:11.204 --> 00:48:12.225]  I've just interviewed a bunch of them.
[00:48:12.245 --> 00:48:13.386]  That's what they explained.
[00:48:14.247 --> 00:48:15.048]  And she's like, wow.
[00:48:15.068 --> 00:48:16.810]  And then she got it right after I had it.
[00:48:17.291 --> 00:48:18.853]  And she was like, I want to go to the hospital.
[00:48:19.714 --> 00:48:20.554]  She's in great shape.
[00:48:21.567 --> 00:48:23.268]  You can run 10 miles out the front door.
[00:48:23.328 --> 00:48:25.148]  You can lift weights for two hours like a gorilla.
[00:48:25.548 --> 00:48:27.389]  I mean, it's like female Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:48:27.809 --> 00:48:29.149]  And she was like, I can't breathe.
[00:48:29.189 --> 00:48:30.610]  I said, don't worry.
[00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:31.550]  I got budessinine.
[00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:32.090]  I got ivermectin.
[00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:33.050]  She's like, oh, it's a lot better.
[00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:35.031]  And then she got better like in four or five days.
[00:48:35.071 --> 00:48:37.292]  But she was like, I want to go to the hospital right now.
[00:48:37.312 --> 00:48:38.132]  I can't breathe.
[00:48:38.692 --> 00:48:40.933]  I came home one day and I was like, I told you, you get it.
[00:48:41.533 --> 00:48:42.253]  This is what it's like.
[00:48:42.293 --> 00:48:50.711]   You just got to chill out because they put a Tube down your throat, that makes inflammation get even worse and you die.
[00:48:51.211 --> 00:48:57.072]  It's not that you're not getting oxygen, it's that your body is going into an anaphylactic shock.
[00:48:58.593 --> 00:49:01.573]  And so, I know what it feels like.
[00:49:02.514 --> 00:49:05.234]  Doesn't matter I took two antigen tests and they said I didn't have it.
[00:49:05.935 --> 00:49:07.875]  This is some spinoff of this crap.
[00:49:08.715 --> 00:49:15.937]  And now they've got all these new super viruses, oh they're all so horrible, and we gotta give pregnant women this shot for RSV and all of it.
[00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:20.490]  Until five years ago, you never gave a pregnant woman any shot.
[00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:29.273]  Everybody knew it would cause an autoimmune disorder, bare minimum in the baby, or the mother, or cause a spontaneous miscarriage.
[00:49:30.094 --> 00:49:31.854]  So they're just messing with us, folks.
[00:49:32.655 --> 00:49:33.435]  They're jacking with us.
[00:49:33.475 --> 00:49:48.541]   But listen, when I said get ready and beef up your body's natural defenses and drink pure water and get sunshine and take a lot of vitamins and minerals and If you don't want to get sick, do stay away from crowds.
[00:49:49.102 --> 00:49:49.442]  Masks.
[00:49:49.523 --> 00:49:50.825]  I don't care if it's the M95.
[00:49:51.306 --> 00:49:53.149]  It's not doing Jack Diddley's squat.
[00:49:54.585 --> 00:50:04.533]  Get to wear a space suit, and then go into ultraviolet radiation for 30 minutes, and then get out and shower your body, not to get a virus like this that's so small.
[00:50:04.553 --> 00:50:04.994]  Okay?
[00:50:05.394 --> 00:50:11.779]  Now, if you've got an ultraviolet decontamination center, and you've got a full space suit, then by all means, wear it.
[00:50:11.799 --> 00:50:12.480]  You're not going to get this.
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:15.242]  But wearing a mask is like...
[00:50:16.543 --> 00:50:18.164]  Saying a cyclone fence is going to stop.
[00:50:18.384 --> 00:50:25.989]  In the midst of the worst health crisis we're facing in more than a century, don't tell your supporters, don't be afraid of COVID.
[00:50:26.349 --> 00:50:30.092]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:50:30.752 --> 00:50:42.119]  Don't tell your supporters, don't be afraid of COVID.
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:44.481]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:50:46.894 --> 00:50:48.775]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:50:48.795 --> 00:50:50.136]  They came in peace.
[00:50:51.116 --> 00:50:53.518]  I just want to say they gave me Regeneron.
[00:50:54.098 --> 00:50:57.140]  We have hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about ready.
[00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:02.963]  And if you're in the hospital and you're feeling really bad, we're going to work it so that you get them and you're going to get them free.
[00:51:03.464 --> 00:51:05.464]  And especially if you're a senior, we're going to get you...
[00:51:05.464 --> 00:51:07.464]  [Gasp]
[00:51:07.464 --> 00:51:09.464]  [Cat meows]
[00:51:09.464 --> 00:51:11.464]  [Screaming]
[00:51:11.464 --> 00:51:13.464]  [Screaming]
[00:51:13.464 --> 00:51:15.464]  [Screaming]
[00:51:15.464 --> 00:51:17.464]  [Screaming]
[00:51:17.464 --> 00:51:19.464]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:51:19.464 --> 00:51:21.464]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:51:21.464 --> 00:51:23.464]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:51:23.464 --> 00:51:25.464]  [Screaming]
[00:51:25.464 --> 00:51:27.464]  [Screaming]
[00:51:27.464 --> 00:51:29.464]  [Screaming]
[00:51:29.464 --> 00:51:30.303]  (laughs)
[00:51:30.291 --> 00:51:32.851]  Is there no one who can tell him don't do this?
[00:51:32.851 --> 00:51:33.650]  CNN.
[00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:44.611]  Alright, I want to be 100% clear with listeners.
[00:51:45.072 --> 00:51:46.052]  This is my best thinking.
[00:51:46.072 --> 00:51:54.496]  I'm going to open the phones up on this topic of COVID, of the attempts to lock down again, of them trying to come out and say, oh, Jones is lying.
[00:51:54.816 --> 00:51:59.398]  There's no plans for new COVID restrictions, even though they announced them right after we broke the news.
[00:52:00.998 --> 00:52:06.720]  Until Big Tree has talked to his investigative reporters, they've confirmed the feds were and are planning this.
[00:52:07.361 --> 00:52:08.281]  And he's very credible.
[00:52:08.881 --> 00:52:10.462]  So, of course, my sources are credible as well.
[00:52:12.352 --> 00:52:13.793]  That's our whole point is being credible.
[00:52:13.853 --> 00:52:17.955]  Why in the hell would I come out here with an announcement that wasn't going to come true?
[00:52:19.296 --> 00:52:23.258]  I said, by me doing this, if we stop it, I'll be attacked and demonized.
[00:52:23.358 --> 00:52:23.678]  Fine.
[00:52:25.359 --> 00:52:27.321]  You're smart enough to figure out we stop it together.
[00:52:27.821 --> 00:52:29.202]  But I had no idea.
[00:52:29.302 --> 00:52:33.564]  I thought we might stop it because of public outrage, and then they just wouldn't roll it out.
[00:52:33.624 --> 00:52:36.486]  No, they began to roll it out right after we made the announcement.
[00:52:37.864 --> 00:52:46.611]  Got huge backlash, and now go, okay, we were never planning any of this, but we do need you to wear a mask and take a shot, and we should shut down public events.
[00:52:47.211 --> 00:52:51.955]  And the colleges are gonna make you take the shot, and so's your job, which is the COVID restrictions.
[00:52:55.317 --> 00:52:57.939]  So seeing them try to clean this up is incredible.
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:05.505]  So I wanna open the phones up, interspersed with all this other news on, what do you think of the new tyranny they're rolling out?
[00:53:06.783 --> 00:53:08.484]  What do you make of how they're badly coordinated?
[00:53:08.945 --> 00:53:10.546]  And what do you really make of COVID?
[00:53:10.927 --> 00:53:32.345]  Because listen, if you think Directed Energy Weapons fried Maui, you have a right to believe that because they exist, and this government's so hijacked, and has run so many weather wars operations against us, that indeed they do have those, and it turns out the second largest base in the world of Directed Energy Weapons the US has is Maui.
[00:53:34.008 --> 00:53:43.856]  That's where the C-130s and DC-10s with high-powered chemical lasers that could fly around and burn down a town in a matter of minutes are based.
[00:53:47.179 --> 00:53:47.479]  Let's see.
[00:53:49.088 --> 00:54:11.102]  I don't need to blame that because I have them admitting BlackRock owned the power company for five years, didn't cut the trees, didn't cut the power when they were told to, and cut the water through an Obama appointee, and didn't turn the emergency sirens on, and ordered the police to block each ends of the town so they'd all burn to death, so there'd be nobody to stand up for their property.
[00:54:11.382 --> 00:54:12.443]  Whole family's annihilated.
[00:54:13.743 --> 00:54:14.464]  And the locals get it.
[00:54:15.526 --> 00:54:16.787]  But that's part of a debate.
[00:54:17.247 --> 00:54:19.129]  We know the official story is not true.
[00:54:19.629 --> 00:54:21.610]  I've not seen evidence of a space laser.
[00:54:22.551 --> 00:54:29.336]  The stuff I saw saying it was a space laser was SpaceX launches.
[00:54:33.499 --> 00:54:34.700]  They didn't show a time lapse of it.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:35.800]  It looks like a laser.
[00:54:37.862 --> 00:54:42.585]  But I have the video of the power lines falling down in line with the town burning it down.
[00:54:42.985 --> 00:54:44.767]  And BlackRock owned it and did it.
[00:54:45.939 --> 00:54:47.259]  And has been trying to buy the town up.
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:54.061]  And somebody hacked the power poles in the weeks before with axes so they'd fall.
[00:54:56.042 --> 00:55:05.104]  So, I don't believe they had the Air Force flying around with space lasers or direct energy weapons.
[00:55:06.724 --> 00:55:07.505]  None of those exist.
[00:55:07.985 --> 00:55:12.566]  But they will exist soon in a form it didn't exist and that's drone controlled.
[00:55:13.749 --> 00:55:43.985]   AI control, where one person in the Pentagon, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, could give an order to an army of aircraft, outside of human control, with no record they did it, and then the computers would erase their operational plan once they were done, and an army, an air force, squadron upon squadron, a hundred squadrons, they have a hundred squadrons of Predator drones alone, I don't know, they have 20,000 of them.
[00:55:44.306 --> 00:55:45.266]  How many squadrons is that?
[00:55:47.407 --> 00:55:48.407]  They can mount with lasers.
[00:55:49.768 --> 00:55:50.428]  The takeoff.
[00:55:51.989 --> 00:55:52.969]  Under one man's order.
[00:55:54.289 --> 00:55:55.690]  Or if they malfunction on their own.
[00:55:58.038 --> 00:55:59.519]  So I'm not saying A.I.
[00:55:59.879 --> 00:56:01.340]  Directed Energy Weapons are important.
[00:56:01.901 --> 00:56:20.654]  I'm saying when you have the video of the power lines falling and the transformers blowing up and the police blockading the town and the water not being deliberately turned off, you gotta go with what's admitted.
[00:56:21.595 --> 00:56:24.957]  And that burns the globalists just as bad as it was space lasers.
[00:56:25.457 --> 00:56:32.579]   Now here's why Directed Energy Weapons And if you're actually burning a town down, it wouldn't be from space because that takes a more powerful laser to shoot into the atmosphere.
[00:56:32.779 --> 00:56:33.560]  You do it close up.
[00:56:37.704 --> 00:56:49.475]  The reason direct energy weapons are so good is you don't have to have Blackrock not trim the trees for five years and cut the water off and cut the sirens off.
[00:56:51.618 --> 00:56:53.359]  Which they did do, which caused the fire.
[00:56:54.079 --> 00:56:58.380]  You can just fly in in high winds and zap a few key points and it does burn down.
[00:57:01.281 --> 00:57:03.662]  So I'm not saying it's a real, not a real threat.
[00:57:04.202 --> 00:57:08.163]  I'm not saying it's not something we should be looking at very, very closely.
[00:57:08.683 --> 00:57:09.444]  It's a real thing.
[00:57:10.984 --> 00:57:12.545]  And I got something special for you today.
[00:57:13.165 --> 00:57:14.025]  If we take some calls.
[00:57:16.206 --> 00:57:16.606]  See this?
[00:57:20.256 --> 00:57:22.217]  Weather and Climate Modification.
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:27.241]  This is from the U.S.
[00:57:27.281 --> 00:57:30.383]  government in 1965.
[00:57:30.523 --> 00:57:46.193]  And when you read this, they say we can modify the environment to make people accept environmental rules.
[00:57:47.594 --> 00:57:48.935]  They describe exactly what they're doing.
[00:57:51.038 --> 00:57:55.680]  So yes, I don't poo-poo anybody that wants to say this is direct energy weapons.
[00:57:57.781 --> 00:58:19.891]  But when we have them, with the power lines falling down, with the juice still left on, and Blackrock owns them, and they wouldn't deliver the water, and they turned off the sirens, and they blocked the people in, and they diverted the fire department north of the hills to non-threatening fires, it's a choreographed operation.
[00:58:21.078 --> 00:58:21.478]  In my view.
[00:58:22.879 --> 00:58:23.899]  As the locals are gonna say.
[00:58:25.759 --> 00:58:28.960]  But it's a microcosm of everything else we're facing.
[00:58:30.001 --> 00:58:42.005]  So I will not disregard the power lines down and the proof that shows what they did just because there's the possibility it could have been something else.
[00:58:42.465 --> 00:58:44.185]  As soon as I see evidence of that, fine.
[00:58:46.006 --> 00:58:47.706]  But we know who owned the power lines.
[00:58:48.046 --> 00:58:48.567]  BlackRock.
[00:58:48.387 --> 00:58:55.387]  We know who did it.
[00:58:55.387 --> 00:59:02.816]   So that's why I'm saying, in this case, direct energy weapons are a distraction from "we have them
[00:59:02.816 --> 00:59:03.387]  red-handed."
[00:59:03.387 --> 00:59:13.387]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:59:05.061 --> 00:59:06.202]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.

[00:59:06.282 --> 00:59:19.621]   877-789-2539. 877-789-ALEX. 877-789-2539. We're talking about the new COVID protocols
[00:59:19.621 --> 00:59:24.882]   that have been rolled out and they're gaslighting saying it's not happening.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.061]  Alex Jones is crazy.
[00:59:27.102 --> 00:59:28.943]  That's how they grabbed victory from the jaws of defeat.
[00:59:29.644 --> 00:59:42.575]  And what you expect them to do next and what you think we should do next to counter them and what you think of O'Bien's new shot that quote is going to protect you from the quote new variant that they have magically ready.
[00:59:42.595 --> 00:59:43.175]  877-789-2539.
[00:59:42.995 --> 00:59:52.115]   877-789-2539. Your phone calls are straight ahead. Then, AI taking over
[00:59:52.115 --> 00:59:58.275]   airline pilots, the latest on the Trump attacks, the climate change power grab,
[00:59:58.275 --> 01:00:03.595]  Greece caught, so this is my top story.
[01:00:02.404 --> 01:00:10.328]  Wow, the Greece, the government of Greece caught 79 leftists, they even say it's leftists, environmentalists, setting the fires.
[01:00:10.729 --> 01:00:11.749]  They're doing it everywhere, folks.
[01:00:12.370 --> 01:00:15.832]  And they use the cover of environmental conferences to come to your town and burn your ass out.
[01:00:17.287 --> 01:00:21.530]  Welcome back to this live, Monday, August 28, 2023 transmission.
[01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:23.371]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.151 --> 01:00:27.313]  And if you're a TV viewer, here's what we're going to be covering next segment.
[01:00:27.333 --> 01:00:28.534]  I'm going to go to your calls right now.
[01:00:28.554 --> 01:00:31.656]  I'm going to hit this story when we come back, and then go right back to your calls.
[01:00:32.557 --> 01:00:36.359]  Greece wildfires, 79 people arrested for arson.
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:37.740]  BBC.
[01:00:39.441 --> 01:00:40.062]  Here's another one.
[01:00:40.102 --> 01:00:44.985]  Greek authorities arrest 79 arsonists, scum, in connection with devastating wildfires.
[01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:48.671]  And he goes on.
[01:00:49.852 --> 01:00:53.775]  You don't just think they go block roads and block cars and block factories.
[01:00:53.875 --> 01:00:54.055]  No.
[01:00:54.675 --> 01:00:59.219]  When the high winds are blowing they get their order and they go out and they start burning stuff down.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.642]  We're going to cover that next segment but I'm going to get to some of your calls as promised.
[01:01:04.423 --> 01:01:10.007]  Right now we have John Kerry saying now humanity is inexorably threatened by humanity itself.
[01:01:10.508 --> 01:01:11.449]  Which he's telling you the truth.
[01:01:11.489 --> 01:01:12.349]  We're threatened by him.
[01:01:13.911 --> 01:01:16.533]  They finance, the big oil companies fund the Green Movement.
[01:01:17.475 --> 01:01:18.636]  I'll explain it all coming up.
[01:01:19.456 --> 01:01:20.897]  This is a total takeover.
[01:01:22.658 --> 01:01:25.380]  They've got us by the huevos, folks, but we can defeat them.
[01:01:29.122 --> 01:01:29.963]  It's the same everywhere.
[01:01:30.023 --> 01:01:36.187]  You have a big environmental conference, a big sustainability conference, a smart ring conference.
[01:01:37.548 --> 01:01:40.830]  They use that to shoehorn as their cover as intelligence ops.
[01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:42.491]  This is coming out now.
[01:01:43.011 --> 01:01:44.052]  Into your town or city.
[01:01:44.212 --> 01:01:59.633]   Doesn't matter whether it's in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America, the US, and then they put their little mask on, they get their rent cars, they go out, they set their fires, and they leave.
[01:02:01.034 --> 01:02:01.714]  They mean business.
[01:02:02.755 --> 01:02:03.976]  These are military operations.
[01:02:06.458 --> 01:02:09.641]  They've been caught all over the world, Julian.
[01:02:11.345 --> 01:02:17.187]  If there's high winds, and you live in a population center, the left's coming to burn you and your family down.
[01:02:18.627 --> 01:02:20.287]  They don't want to just chop your son's penis off.
[01:02:21.028 --> 01:02:24.148]  They don't want to just create blue cities with fentanyl and needles and hummus everywhere.
[01:02:24.369 --> 01:02:25.869]  They want to destroy you.
[01:02:26.889 --> 01:02:30.990]  Because they're the manager class, they believe when stuff collapses, they're going to get full control of all of it.
[01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:33.291]  They've been promised positions of power.
[01:02:35.071 --> 01:02:36.752]  Levi, thanks for holding from Maui.
[01:02:38.817 --> 01:02:40.758]  You want to talk about the fires in Hawaii?
[01:02:41.018 --> 01:02:42.679]  I'll do that.
[01:02:42.879 --> 01:02:47.582]  I'm glad to talk to you, but in fact, let me just put you on hold.
[01:02:48.603 --> 01:02:57.768]  I said on air that we're taking calls on how they're going to try to roll out the new COVID lockdowns and the new restrictions.
[01:02:57.808 --> 01:03:00.269]  And what do you think of the fact that we've gotten ahead of it this time?
[01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:06.433]  And I said, we're only covering that topic, but I noticed people ignore me, which is fine.
[01:03:10.891 --> 01:03:12.272]  And people are calling in about Hawaii.
[01:03:12.992 --> 01:03:14.993]  Mountain Patriot wants to talk about Hawaiian fires.
[01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:19.935]  Patriot Rep wants to talk about Maui fires.
[01:03:22.256 --> 01:03:24.657]  Gavin wants to talk about the fires.
[01:03:28.659 --> 01:03:29.479]  And so does Levi.
[01:03:29.499 --> 01:03:30.680]  So we'll go to Levi and Maui.
[01:03:34.362 --> 01:03:37.103]  Maybe we shouldn't talk about how they're rolling out a new lockdown.
[01:03:37.123 --> 01:03:42.448]   Or how they're rolling out a new Mass mandate a new injection.
[01:03:42.468 --> 01:03:52.473]  I mean, I think Maui's important as a microcosm of what they'll do to all of us, but I just get, it's so weird.
[01:03:52.573 --> 01:04:00.397]  Like, like I said, I only want to take calls on the shots and what you think about that.
[01:04:01.138 --> 01:04:02.238]  And I'm happy to take the Maui.
[01:04:02.258 --> 01:04:07.761]  In fact, we won't take calls on COVID and the shots and the new rollout.
[01:04:07.821 --> 01:04:09.202]  We'll only take calls on Maui.
[01:04:10.171 --> 01:04:11.012]  I think that's reasonable.
[01:04:15.714 --> 01:04:17.856]  Then everybody will call it the shots though as soon as I say that.
[01:04:19.717 --> 01:04:20.397]  I don't know anymore.
[01:04:22.198 --> 01:04:23.899]  Because we need to have a big debate, you know.
[01:04:26.581 --> 01:04:29.703]  You saw what happened when we got excited about their new rollout plan.
[01:04:30.243 --> 01:04:32.945]  We were able to get ahead of it and really put a dent in it.
[01:04:35.086 --> 01:04:36.007]  And Maui's important.
[01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:38.088]  We've covered that ad nauseum.
[01:04:40.458 --> 01:04:41.098]  Let's just do this.
[01:04:41.138 --> 01:04:42.099]  Let's just go to your phone calls.
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:45.181]  Hell, maybe I should just walk for a while.
[01:04:47.142 --> 01:04:48.162]  Maybe that's just the answer.
[01:04:48.182 --> 01:04:49.483]  Just give everybody what they want.
[01:04:49.723 --> 01:04:51.004]  Everybody wants it so bad.
[01:04:51.024 --> 01:04:54.425]  I mean, you want Klaus Schwab to kill you and your family, don't you?
[01:04:54.445 --> 01:04:55.206]  I mean, you actually do.
[01:04:58.007 --> 01:04:59.128]  Maybe he is better than you.
[01:04:59.168 --> 01:05:00.289]  Maybe he does need to kill you.
[01:05:00.449 --> 01:05:01.569]  Maybe he does deserve everything.
[01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:03.010]  He's organized.
[01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:03.590]  He's serious.
[01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:04.411]  He's focused.
[01:05:04.431 --> 01:05:05.051]  He's got a plan.
[01:05:05.952 --> 01:05:06.572]  He means business.
[01:05:09.056 --> 01:05:10.597]  Levi, Maui, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:05:12.678 --> 01:05:18.361]  Hey Alex, yeah, sorry, when it popped up it looked like you were talking about Maui Stiller.
[01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:22.504]  No, I'm not even trying to bitch at you, it's that I have no control over anything here.
[01:05:24.173 --> 01:05:25.933]  You don't understand what it's like.
[01:05:26.074 --> 01:05:27.794]  I have no control, other than quitting.
[01:05:28.514 --> 01:05:29.494]  But it looks better every day.
[01:05:30.415 --> 01:05:32.615]  Listen, let's just not go there right now.
[01:05:33.055 --> 01:05:34.896]  Please don't say sorry you called in about Maui.
[01:05:35.396 --> 01:05:37.216]  You shouldn't be sorry you called in about Maui.
[01:05:37.857 --> 01:05:39.497]  It's important you called in about Maui.
[01:05:41.178 --> 01:05:41.598]  Go ahead.
[01:05:44.018 --> 01:05:48.039]  Yeah, I just wanted to bring some light in regards to Lahaina.
[01:05:48.099 --> 01:05:49.980]  I went over there to help with Humane Society.
[01:05:50.976 --> 01:05:52.857]  I wanted to bring up Eric West.
[01:05:53.477 --> 01:05:57.418]  He's been documenting it so well from the very beginning.
[01:05:57.438 --> 01:05:59.219]  He had the drone up the very next day.
[01:05:59.239 --> 01:06:01.579]  He's been meeting with the family members.
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:06.321]  His last two videos have profound anomalies.
[01:06:08.502 --> 01:06:09.482]  It's incredible.
[01:06:09.582 --> 01:06:15.124]  So I just suggest that people head over and check him out because I believe what he's doing is very profound.
[01:06:15.984 --> 01:06:18.525]  What are the profound anomalies?
[01:06:20.421 --> 01:06:37.333]  The profound anomalies are, you know, we have cars completely away from anything, but shrub that's not even properly burned, there's still grain around it, the highway on both sides untouched, on the other side and a little bit down low, and you have the pulverized car.
[01:06:37.353 --> 01:06:45.139]  So yeah, I'm not saying anything, I'm just saying it's good to account for everything, but I agree with you.
[01:06:46.123 --> 01:06:48.044]  They have completely been busted.
[01:06:48.565 --> 01:06:49.085]  No, you're right.
[01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:58.330]  I mean, they do have airship-based, not so much space-based, microwaves, which are direct energy weapons, that will cause cars to explode.
[01:06:58.931 --> 01:07:00.812]  So I wouldn't put it past the technocracy.
[01:07:01.212 --> 01:07:04.254]  They got a huge secret weather program that's all admitted that's going on.
[01:07:04.274 --> 01:07:05.495]  No one wants to talk about it.
[01:07:05.795 --> 01:07:06.135]  Who knows?
[01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:08.977]  They might have hit them, not with space lasers, but with microwaves.
[01:07:10.482 --> 01:07:17.087]  I just think they've been shipping stuff out here from HAARP since 1993, since the Aloha 93 project.
[01:07:17.668 --> 01:07:19.349]  I document it every year.
[01:07:19.469 --> 01:07:24.113]  They run so much geoengineering projects here, it'll blow your mind.
[01:07:24.193 --> 01:07:29.137]  I mean, it's paradise, but at the same time, they are constantly manipulating the weather here.
[01:07:29.598 --> 01:07:34.542]  I try to wake my friends up in regards to it, but yeah, they just want to willfully be ignorant about it.
[01:07:34.602 --> 01:07:38.665]  But yeah, I believe that they pulled out all the cards.
[01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:41.711]  It's one of the areas Joe Rogan is still wrong.
[01:07:42.212 --> 01:07:49.777]  He used to believe in chemtrails, geoengineering, and then he did a show how they weren't real like 10 years ago, and he says they're not real, but it's declassified they're doing it.
[01:07:50.497 --> 01:07:53.139]  They don't call them chemtrails, they call it geoengineering.
[01:07:53.819 --> 01:07:58.262]  And it's going on, it's happening everywhere, and it's very, very serious.
[01:07:58.623 --> 01:08:11.270]   I'm seeing the videos you're talking about, but Part 2 on his YouTube channel is just going completely viral, but he's been awesome and he's been meeting with the people getting the money directly.
[01:08:11.771 --> 01:08:18.637]  Because a lot of my friends are the ones that ran the operations to the survivors of Lahaina and those guys were left for dead.
[01:08:18.797 --> 01:08:25.223]  The community has been the 100% support system and the first week they completely outperformed the government.
[01:08:25.723 --> 01:08:30.928]  Actually, you know, they're still jumping through hoops trying to get their money, 700 bucks, from FEMA right now.
[01:08:32.069 --> 01:08:33.049]  It's all a sick joke.
[01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:39.092]  Meanwhile, FEMA gets $1,000 a night at Bill Gates' hotel the four seasons they're in Maui.
[01:08:40.392 --> 01:08:41.592]  It's all about rubbing it in.
[01:08:41.632 --> 01:08:42.393]  It's all about doing it.
[01:08:42.553 --> 01:08:44.173]  Because the public loves getting murdered.
[01:08:44.894 --> 01:08:46.474]  The public loves getting killed by the government.
[01:08:46.954 --> 01:08:47.394]  They love it.
[01:08:47.755 --> 01:08:48.355]  It's our religion.
[01:08:50.595 --> 01:08:57.118]  Look, if you're sitting on the most expensive land in America, we're talking thousands of dollars a square inch.
[01:08:58.806 --> 01:09:06.148]  And you run your BlackRock and you run the power company, you just don't trim the trees, leave the power on, it burns down, and your other investments get it.
[01:09:07.288 --> 01:09:07.929]  It's that simple.
[01:09:07.969 --> 01:09:08.369]  They did it.
[01:09:08.409 --> 01:09:08.969]  It's all come out.
[01:09:09.989 --> 01:09:14.390]  So I'm not trying to limit people to just the topic of the new COVID rollouts.
[01:09:15.471 --> 01:09:17.591]  Maybe tomorrow we have a special guest on.
[01:09:19.212 --> 01:09:23.633]  We'll just open the phones up on leftist artists and the different ways they do it.
[01:09:25.367 --> 01:09:27.228]  Because you don't need a directed energy weapon to do it.
[01:09:27.649 --> 01:09:29.130]  You don't even need an arsonist to do it.
[01:09:29.690 --> 01:09:38.838]  If you don't trim the trees in dry weather around major towns and then leave the power on when the storm comes, it will burn the town down.
[01:09:39.558 --> 01:09:39.879]  Period.
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:47.585]  You know, a five-year-old knows if you're in the bathtub, don't plug in mom's hair dryer and throw it in the water.
[01:09:47.805 --> 01:09:48.505]  You're going to electrocute.
[01:09:50.506 --> 01:09:58.231]  This is default stuff, folks, like, your car's on empty, better get gas, or, you know, don't take cyanide, it'll kill you.
[01:10:01.093 --> 01:10:08.278]  And people are freaking out watching this happen, and they're realizing that it's premeditated anyway, you slice it.
[01:10:08.999 --> 01:10:13.002]  And knowing the globalists, they might have thrown in a C-130 that was drone operated.
[01:10:13.362 --> 01:10:16.404]  They've got those now, and done some extra zapping to burn it down.
[01:10:16.684 --> 01:10:17.165]  I don't know.
[01:10:17.825 --> 01:10:18.906]  I just know we got them.
[01:10:20.111 --> 01:10:20.771]  On everything else.
[01:10:22.312 --> 01:10:22.672]  We got them.
[01:10:24.833 --> 01:10:27.335]  And we can't prove lasers.
[01:10:27.595 --> 01:10:29.716]  We can sure as hell prove they left those power lines on.
[01:10:29.956 --> 01:10:30.816]  They didn't trim the trees.
[01:10:31.116 --> 01:10:34.718]  BlackRock said for environmental reasons, we don't upkeep our power lines anymore.
[01:10:35.218 --> 01:10:36.459]  They use them as a weapon against us.
[01:10:37.139 --> 01:10:38.880]  And then they barricaded the people in the town.
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:39.901]  That happened.
[01:10:40.561 --> 01:10:42.322]  You can't prove direct energy weapons.
[01:10:43.922 --> 01:10:48.103]  You can prove they got orders to barricade him in that town when the fire was at their back.
[01:10:48.683 --> 01:10:49.584]  That's open and shut.
[01:10:49.884 --> 01:10:51.184]  Who gave the order?
[01:10:51.344 --> 01:10:52.164]  We got their ass.
[01:10:52.545 --> 01:10:54.165]  And it goes right up the chain to Larry Fink.
[01:10:54.925 --> 01:10:56.066]  Right to the top of the pyramid.
[01:10:57.126 --> 01:10:58.926]  So I'm the one saying I don't want to take calls on Maui.
[01:10:58.967 --> 01:10:59.687]  It's not that.
[01:11:00.067 --> 01:11:01.967]  It's that I'm trying to take calls and focus.
[01:11:01.987 --> 01:11:02.928]  We'll do Maui tomorrow.
[01:11:04.048 --> 01:11:04.648]  I'm trying.
[01:11:04.668 --> 01:11:05.909]  I already covered it at lunch today.
[01:11:05.969 --> 01:11:06.989]  We'll cover it next hour too.
[01:11:08.795 --> 01:11:13.958]  I'm trying to cover the fact they're trying new lockdowns everywhere.
[01:11:13.978 --> 01:11:19.581]  They're trying more masking force injections that have already killed 20 million people worldwide.
[01:11:19.922 --> 01:11:23.384]  And when they shut down the third world, it causes mass starvation and death.
[01:11:24.591 --> 01:11:35.160]  So I was opening the phones up to hear from listeners specifically where you work, at colleges, or at grocery stores, or at hotels, or in law enforcement.
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:35.840]  What are you hearing?
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:37.482]  Because I got stacks of news here.
[01:11:37.722 --> 01:11:41.765]  They're bringing back the mask and the shots and the lockdowns and all of it.
[01:11:42.065 --> 01:11:44.047]  And we got the Fed saying Alex Jones is wrong.
[01:11:44.287 --> 01:11:45.568]  We're not planning any such thing.
[01:11:45.808 --> 01:11:48.551]  But we do have a new shot for you, though, the middle of next month.
[01:11:49.653 --> 01:11:52.616]  Just like I told you before they did, from our sources.
[01:11:53.517 --> 01:11:54.838]  So how do we get ahead of it?
[01:11:55.139 --> 01:11:56.100]  What do you think's next?
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:12:03.447]  How big a win is it that they're all unstable right now because they wanted to roll it out and incrementally not have a debate up front?
[01:12:04.368 --> 01:12:06.851]  That's why I wanted to focus on that topic.
[01:12:07.992 --> 01:12:11.876]  We've been focusing a lot on Hawaii and it's just as important in the aggregate.
[01:12:13.373 --> 01:12:15.555]  And look at the lockdown they had in Hawaii and what that did.
[01:12:16.275 --> 01:12:17.777]  This is all the same people.
[01:12:18.077 --> 01:12:35.031]  The same people that created the conditions and choreographed that inferno are the same ones choreographing World War III, open borders, the attacks on our children, the pedophilia, the COVID lockdowns, the poison shots, the whole shooting match.
[01:12:38.394 --> 01:12:40.496]  All right, I'm gonna go in the order your calls are received.
[01:12:44.588 --> 01:12:46.129]  And we got a caller in Italy.
[01:12:48.411 --> 01:12:49.552]  I pronounced everything wrong.
[01:12:50.973 --> 01:12:53.135]  Is that Savirio?
[01:12:54.716 --> 01:12:55.336]  Savarro?
[01:12:57.838 --> 01:12:59.739]  You guys, they don't talk a lot in my ear.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.441]  Let me tell you, the crew doesn't talk a lot in my ear.
[01:13:02.462 --> 01:13:04.343]  When they do, they never hit the button full power.
[01:13:04.963 --> 01:13:05.944]  They just kind of hit it.
[01:13:06.284 --> 01:13:10.107]  I'm not complaining.
[01:13:10.668 --> 01:13:12.169]  Just push it down and tell me what you said.
[01:13:14.008 --> 01:13:15.209]  Severio, thank you very much.
[01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:18.611]  All right, Severio in Italy, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:13:19.952 --> 01:13:41.245]  Yeah, I was talking about the Europe, it's already here in Italy, the North, I'm from South, in North they start already mask mandate, many government, you know, place, and school, hospital, and you can see in some grocery store, you gotta have a mask, or you know, buy food.
[01:13:42.061 --> 01:13:46.461]   And like every time it happened, come from there and go United States.
[01:13:46.461 --> 01:13:48.622]  But you're right. You all the time. Right.
[01:13:48.622 --> 01:13:53.782]   You told the last time you'd be coming here like the United States in September.
[01:13:53.782 --> 01:13:56.461]  They'd be the mask and the new shot or whatever.
[01:13:56.461 --> 01:13:57.942]  I feel very bad.
[01:13:57.942 --> 01:14:01.541]  Georgia Maloney, she's a sold out like everybody.
[01:14:01.541 --> 01:14:08.900]   And I buy the one nice shirt from you about Donald Trump shirt.
[01:14:08.981 --> 01:14:12.100]  I want to use that when they go to Italian, you know.
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:18.341]   Please for protesting and that guy, you're the president's shirt, which is beautiful.
[01:14:19.016 --> 01:14:19.997]  And I bought one more.
[01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:22.958]  And God bless you, Alex.
[01:14:23.278 --> 01:14:28.660]  And hopefully something happens because this time it's been very bad.
[01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:33.002]  And in Greece, I want to let you know in Greece, the fire there is like Hawaii.
[01:14:33.162 --> 01:14:34.803]  It's almost the same scenario.
[01:14:35.303 --> 01:14:39.385]  An ex-military guy from the French coalition.
[01:14:40.263 --> 01:14:43.124]  And we know a lot of top secret things, but yeah.
[01:14:43.484 --> 01:14:49.266]  Anyway, they will shut down all the planet again, but this time for good, I think so.
[01:14:49.667 --> 01:14:50.367]  Thank you so much.
[01:14:50.747 --> 01:14:52.288]  Saverio, thank you so much.
[01:14:52.328 --> 01:14:53.428]  So there's Saverio.
[01:14:55.689 --> 01:15:02.952]  And he's laying out what's happening in Italy, the same thing as last time.
[01:15:02.992 --> 01:15:09.054]  So they don't want us to debate it while they roll it out again, but thank God for the listeners and the crew and all of us were here today.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:12.140]  And obviously we know they're rolling it out.
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:13.601]  We see all the signs everywhere.
[01:15:15.181 --> 01:15:16.461]  Steve in Georgia, you're on the air.
[01:15:16.481 --> 01:15:18.982]  We're talking about new variant targeting against children.
[01:15:19.022 --> 01:15:20.682]  Bill Gates promised that would be the case.
[01:15:21.123 --> 01:15:21.923]  What's your view on that?
[01:15:23.343 --> 01:15:27.244]  Yes, I was going to call and just ask if you heard anything.
[01:15:27.464 --> 01:15:34.806]  I've heard that it's targeted for old people and children this time, to kill them mainly.
[01:15:35.822 --> 01:15:40.405]  You know, they're actually making a target on those people.
[01:15:41.005 --> 01:15:45.468]  Well, you know, the COVID shot targets old people and young people and not middle-aged people.
[01:15:45.508 --> 01:15:51.652]  But yeah, I've seen Bill Gates and others say, the next pandemic will target children.
[01:15:51.672 --> 01:15:54.794]  And then he says the next pandemic will be far worse.
[01:15:55.214 --> 01:15:55.995]  So does Joe Biden.
[01:15:57.456 --> 01:16:00.638]  Yeah, I've got grandchildren that would be about that age.
[01:16:00.718 --> 01:16:04.140]  And I haven't seen many masks here in Georgia yet.
[01:16:04.717 --> 01:16:09.717]   And I haven't been to a hospital, I'm not gonna go to a hospital.
[01:16:09.717 --> 01:16:14.717]   But I haven't seen them out in the public, you know, general public, nobody's wearing them around here.
[01:16:14.717 --> 01:16:17.717]  I'm not gonna wear one, I'll never have one.
[01:16:17.717 --> 01:16:21.717]  Well, I tried to say it earlier but we slammed into a break.
[01:16:21.717 --> 01:16:27.717]   But there's a great meme, it's a photo of a woman on one side of a cyclone fence saying,
[01:16:27.717 --> 01:16:30.717]  "I wear my mask so I don't get COVID."
[01:16:30.814 --> 01:16:36.279]  And the man behind the fence says, I put up this cyclone fence so I don't have mosquitoes.
[01:16:37.079 --> 01:16:43.966]  And it's actually a mosquito per capita is bigger than the virus flying through the cyclone fence.
[01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:58.301]  Yeah, and I've tried to explain that I had this doctor tried to make me put a mask on when I went to see him, and I wouldn't do it, and they tried to make me leave, so I left, and I told him, I said, air goes through this mask, what's gonna...
[01:16:59.261 --> 01:17:03.504]  It's not going to stop a germ from going through there.
[01:17:03.545 --> 01:17:04.946]  How's it going to stop a germ from going through?
[01:17:04.966 --> 01:17:05.906]  Well, that's the thing though.
[01:17:06.807 --> 01:17:10.330]  If the mask supposedly protects them, why does it matter?
[01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:13.913]  No, it's all an act of contrition, of worship, of submission.
[01:17:14.633 --> 01:17:17.335]  The question is, hey, your mask protects you, right?
[01:17:17.696 --> 01:17:18.676]  Why do I got to wear one?
[01:17:19.757 --> 01:17:21.058]  No, it doesn't protect them.
[01:17:22.279 --> 01:17:23.360]  And I'm not wearing one.
[01:17:25.362 --> 01:17:26.503]  They just have to shoot me.
[01:17:27.622 --> 01:17:30.563]  Well, the good news is, brother, you called into this show and you care.
[01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:33.243]  So keep spreading the word and God bless you and your family.
[01:17:36.304 --> 01:17:36.504]  All right.
[01:17:37.664 --> 01:17:39.804]  Let's just skip this break so we get more time.
[01:17:40.385 --> 01:17:43.565]  And again, if I'm grumpy today to the crew and everybody else, it's nothing to do with you.
[01:17:44.325 --> 01:17:45.326]  I'm not going to lie to people.
[01:17:45.866 --> 01:17:47.226]  I used to get sick about every five years.
[01:17:48.286 --> 01:17:48.906]  No big deal.
[01:17:49.846 --> 01:17:50.707]  I mean, I get the flu.
[01:17:50.747 --> 01:17:51.487]  I'll be over it in a day.
[01:17:52.147 --> 01:17:53.387]  I know what COVID feels like.
[01:17:54.427 --> 01:17:56.988]  And I had it two and a half years ago.
[01:17:58.393 --> 01:17:59.173]  And I got it right now.
[01:17:59.754 --> 01:18:01.895]  I've already gone to two antigen tests at clinics.
[01:18:01.915 --> 01:18:03.676]  I'm getting a blood test today.
[01:18:03.976 --> 01:18:06.697]  When I leave here, I feel like I've been run over by a truck.
[01:18:07.557 --> 01:18:10.839]  And I probably shouldn't be here because I feel nasty as a rattlesnake right now.
[01:18:11.259 --> 01:18:12.640]  So I'm being a jerk to people.
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:14.201]  It's nothing to do with the crew or you or anybody.
[01:18:14.221 --> 01:18:16.302]  In fact, we should take Maui calls.
[01:18:16.542 --> 01:18:17.362]  I should have said both.
[01:18:17.682 --> 01:18:19.863]  They hung up on a whole bunch of Maui calls and I feel bad now.
[01:18:20.184 --> 01:18:21.504]  Because I care about that just as much.
[01:18:21.784 --> 01:18:22.865]  It's the same damn people.
[01:18:23.385 --> 01:18:26.367]  It's just I want to get focused on the COVID thing because that's going to hit.
[01:18:26.687 --> 01:18:29.248]  That's going to starve hundreds of millions of people to death.
[01:18:29.569 --> 01:18:30.669]  It's going to flood the borders.
[01:18:31.410 --> 01:18:31.670]  Yeah.
[01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:33.511]  And you know, one man's.
[01:18:35.339 --> 01:18:35.799]  I'm fired.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:37.421]  It's a recession.
[01:18:37.481 --> 01:18:38.101]  You get fired.
[01:18:38.141 --> 01:18:38.742]  It's depression.
[01:18:39.242 --> 01:18:40.303]  I care about those people.
[01:18:40.904 --> 01:18:42.705]  So don't think I don't want to talk about Maui.
[01:18:42.765 --> 01:18:46.668]  I had two guests today that had to go deal with a relief effort.
[01:18:46.688 --> 01:18:47.309]  Couldn't come on.
[01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:49.390]  So we were going to cover Maui today.
[01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:51.492]  But I just started thinking about big picture.
[01:18:51.532 --> 01:18:52.753]  What affects even more people?
[01:18:53.634 --> 01:18:56.056]  And that's that's that's these shots and that's this poison.
[01:18:56.096 --> 01:18:56.776]  That's what they're doing.
[01:18:57.537 --> 01:18:59.318]  We're going to skip this break and take calls here.
[01:19:00.739 --> 01:19:02.321]  Let's talk to Carlos in Houston.
[01:19:02.361 --> 01:19:03.201]  Carlos, you're on the air.
[01:19:03.221 --> 01:19:03.522]  Go ahead.
[01:19:05.256 --> 01:19:06.017]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[01:19:06.197 --> 01:19:08.219]  It's always a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:19:08.239 --> 01:19:12.983]  Me and you talked about, I gotta say, about eight months ago.
[01:19:13.003 --> 01:19:18.067]  My mom was doing real bad with the kidneys because of the remdesivir.
[01:19:18.227 --> 01:19:20.229]  She went on to be with the Lord.
[01:19:20.249 --> 01:19:22.250]  Oh, sorry to hear that.
[01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:22.971]  So take your time.
[01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:28.586]   We talked about One of your family members, Anran Dezevere, you didn't know it would kill him, you're saying it did.
[01:19:28.947 --> 01:19:32.949]  They know it does zero help, and what, 30-something percent of the time, kills you.
[01:19:32.969 --> 01:19:35.591]  And that's Fauci again, like you did with AZT.
[01:19:35.952 --> 01:19:37.012]  So tell folks what happened.
[01:19:38.133 --> 01:19:43.977]  Well, for about 18 months, you know, she was very strong.
[01:19:43.997 --> 01:19:45.639]  We tried everything under the sun.
[01:19:45.679 --> 01:19:47.520]  Hell, we even tried the Ivermectin.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.142]  Again, you know, a couple of doses here and there.
[01:19:50.602 --> 01:19:54.145]  So you had a family member that was sick with COVID for 18 months?
[01:19:55.468 --> 01:19:57.230]  It wasn't COVID.
[01:19:57.890 --> 01:20:05.497]  She initially had COVID and she went to the hospital and they gave her remdesivir, which didn't do her any good.
[01:20:06.057 --> 01:20:14.685]  And it made, in the end, on the very last day she was alive, Alex, she had a full system organ failure.
[01:20:14.905 --> 01:20:16.246]  Yeah, that's what remdesivir does.
[01:20:17.407 --> 01:20:24.572]   Yeah, it is just that She left the doctors kind of like weirded out because like man how does she last this long?
[01:20:24.952 --> 01:20:30.235]  All the people I know Alex and I'm pretty sure you know everybody that's given remdesivir goes within two weeks.
[01:20:30.315 --> 01:20:31.915]  My mom lasted a whole 18 months.
[01:20:31.995 --> 01:20:33.376]  Yeah your mother was tough as nails.
[01:20:34.476 --> 01:20:44.558]   And that's exactly what she was and she didn't want to go in the end but Alex These COVID lockdowns and the Maui fires, everything coincides with each other.
[01:20:44.958 --> 01:20:54.361]  They don't want you to talk about one thing, they don't want you to talk about the other, so you're crossed between having to talk about both of them, and we can't get the message of either out, if that makes any sense.
[01:20:55.501 --> 01:20:56.461]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:20:56.501 --> 01:21:03.683]  The globalists hit us with so many crises, they even admit that in their manuals, that while we're trying to cover one, they hit us with the next, they hit us with the next.
[01:21:03.824 --> 01:21:05.064]  What you said is absolutely true.
[01:21:06.621 --> 01:21:12.645]  And you don't even get a chance to really get up and get over the first one they hit you and you're dealing with the freaking next one.
[01:21:13.045 --> 01:21:14.446]  And that's the purpose behind it.
[01:21:14.826 --> 01:21:21.289]  They want us either to die with the next injection or they want you to die and starve of hunger.
[01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:32.195]  Because if they push these mandates and the Supreme Court actually doesn't support the contractors and the workers across the country, we're all screwed.
[01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:38.713]  No matter which way you do it, it's either you take the vaccine and you die, or you don't take the vaccine and you die.
[01:21:40.733 --> 01:21:43.254]  You just can't, you just can't make this up, Alex.
[01:21:43.375 --> 01:21:52.358]  And, you know, watching my mother take her last breath because of these bastards, that's what they want for everybody, Alex.
[01:21:53.539 --> 01:21:54.559]  That's exactly what they want.
[01:21:54.579 --> 01:21:56.180]  They almost killed my dad.
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:57.300]  They almost killed Rabdu.
[01:21:57.340 --> 01:22:08.142]   And I'm so blessed, brother, being able to control yourself because I've been really honest about this, I'm a non-violent guy because they want to use it against us, but there's a few people, I saw them in person, I don't know what I'd do.
[01:22:08.162 --> 01:22:20.085]  You know, people like Fauci, people like Bill Gates, I mean they are laughing about it, they think it's so funny, and they knew day one, Randesivir would fry anybody's kidneys and liver.
[01:22:21.106 --> 01:22:23.646]  And they're giving it to children.
[01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:27.527]  Imagine the, and I'll be honest, it takes a lot of will.
[01:22:27.927 --> 01:22:29.468]  I respect Fauci and Gates.
[01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:32.653]  I mean, they are dangerous.
[01:22:32.873 --> 01:22:34.375]  I mean, they are evil.
[01:22:35.176 --> 01:22:36.859]  But your mother has an eternal soul, brother.
[01:22:36.899 --> 01:22:38.080]  You'll see her soon, Carlos.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:38.461]  Thank you.
[01:22:39.802 --> 01:22:40.604]  Oh, my God.
[01:22:44.409 --> 01:22:47.433]  Yeah, you might as well just drink gasoline if you're going to take Remdesivir.
[01:22:49.155 --> 01:22:50.596]  But you gotta love these people, man.
[01:22:51.016 --> 01:22:54.758]  They pick the one thing that'll kill your ass, and then they approve that.
[01:22:55.078 --> 01:23:01.281]  And then, oh, you can't have Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, vitamin D, vitamin C. Oh, no, no, no!
[01:23:01.661 --> 01:23:03.642]  You can't have mudecidine steroid.
[01:23:03.782 --> 01:23:05.142]  No, no, no!
[01:23:05.683 --> 01:23:07.463]  You get Randesivir!
[01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:11.405]  It was even worse in the UK.
[01:23:11.725 --> 01:23:12.646]  They gave them that, um...
[01:23:13.865 --> 01:23:21.692]  I can't remember, the name's too hard to pronounce, but it's like, it's an assisted suicide drug, which makes you, if you give it to somebody, they stop breathing.
[01:23:22.513 --> 01:23:33.582]  So they give it to them and then they kill them, and months before COVID broke out, they bought a record amount of it, like five times the record in the UK, and then just murdered people.
[01:23:34.003 --> 01:23:39.267]  And to them, it's like power, like, I'm a bureaucrat, I'm murdering people, I'm murdering people!
[01:23:39.508 --> 01:23:40.769]  It's like a video game to them.
[01:23:42.415 --> 01:23:44.795]  Imagine the office, like, we have empathy, we care about people.
[01:23:45.216 --> 01:23:48.236]  They see that as weak, they're like, look at this guy, he cares about people.
[01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:49.256]  Haha, idiot.
[01:23:50.517 --> 01:23:53.657]  Oh, but as soon as we go after them, oh, you go to a supermax prison.
[01:23:54.017 --> 01:24:02.479]  As soon as you pull out a double-edged dagger and say, you don't care about us and just leave their guts on the ground, you're going to go to a supermax prison because that's a precious Satanist.
[01:24:02.739 --> 01:24:04.219]  That's a precious globalist.
[01:24:04.459 --> 01:24:07.360]  That's a precious murderer that's murdered all these people.
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.061]  Oh, we gotta protect them.
[01:24:09.241 --> 01:24:10.682]  We gotta bow down to them.
[01:24:10.902 --> 01:24:12.703]  Don't you spill their guts on the sidewalk.
[01:24:13.043 --> 01:24:13.644]  No, no.
[01:24:13.904 --> 01:24:17.166]  If you touch one of their little preciouses, cause their lives value.
[01:24:17.366 --> 01:24:21.689]  It's our mothers, and our daughters, and our sons, and our fathers, and our lives.
[01:24:21.909 --> 01:24:23.230]  It's our lives that don't matter.
[01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:28.233]  It's their worshipful, golden calf lives we gotta bow down to.
[01:24:28.253 --> 01:24:31.435]  And if we do anything, the men in black come to get us.
[01:24:32.956 --> 01:24:36.298]  The same men in black the globalists hit with the strongest poison shots.
[01:24:37.602 --> 01:24:38.683]  And they're almost done with them.
[01:24:38.703 --> 01:24:40.124]  Next hour I'm going to cover it.
[01:24:40.284 --> 01:24:41.585]  They're going to all the robots.
[01:24:42.926 --> 01:24:45.268]  Soon there won't be any airline pilots because they're not available.
[01:24:45.429 --> 01:24:46.429]  They're all having heart attacks.
[01:24:48.531 --> 01:24:49.652]  It's all funny to them.
[01:24:50.032 --> 01:24:53.135]  And we just have to sit here and accept it and love it.
[01:24:57.639 --> 01:24:59.140]  Nick in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:25:01.162 --> 01:25:02.443]  Oh man, hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:25:03.624 --> 01:25:04.805]  I'm pretty pissed off right now.
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:06.802]  Yeah, me too.
[01:25:07.162 --> 01:25:11.449]  I've had a couple theories of Wargaming the COVID rollout.
[01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:15.937]  And you know how you rolled it out last Friday, right?
[01:25:16.177 --> 01:25:17.860]  Five hours before they put it out on the news.
[01:25:18.621 --> 01:25:22.163]  Now they're kind of sitting there scrambling, figuring out what they're going to do.
[01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:24.345]  Well, that's why I meant to take your calls, and I'm glad you called.
[01:25:24.365 --> 01:25:26.446]  I apologize, because I'm really out of it today.
[01:25:26.466 --> 01:25:30.148]  I meant to ask listeners, what is their next move?
[01:25:30.168 --> 01:25:31.609]  Because I really respect you.
[01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:33.591]  And don't just say that to pat you on the head.
[01:25:33.951 --> 01:25:36.412]  The listeners all the time take me to the next level.
[01:25:36.753 --> 01:25:41.355]  Or I read comments, or I read emails, because I go to the random InfoWars email.
[01:25:41.415 --> 01:25:42.056]  I just read them.
[01:25:43.997 --> 01:25:45.737]  It just always takes me next level.
[01:25:45.757 --> 01:25:47.418]  The angles you think of, I don't think of.
[01:25:47.798 --> 01:25:48.998]  And that's what I meant to do.
[01:25:49.518 --> 01:25:50.999]  What is their next move?
[01:25:51.019 --> 01:25:54.019]  Go ahead and tell us.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.460]  Well, I've been thinking.
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:00.661]  I don't think they're going to be able to lock us down again like they did previously.
[01:26:00.681 --> 01:26:03.621]  We're all aware and awake to their propaganda.
[01:26:04.161 --> 01:26:08.802]  But I think what could force people to get a little scared is if they start trying to infect the children.
[01:26:09.163 --> 01:26:13.678]   I mean, if you want to really Get into the hearts and minds of the people.
[01:26:13.698 --> 01:26:19.242]  Strategically, as a tyrant, as these globalist scumbags are, you want to hit their kids.
[01:26:19.462 --> 01:26:20.002]  Well, that's right.
[01:26:20.022 --> 01:26:21.523]  And that will bend some knees.
[01:26:21.663 --> 01:26:22.164]  You know what I mean?
[01:26:22.404 --> 01:26:23.245]  Let's pull it up.
[01:26:23.305 --> 01:26:27.007]  It was Bill Gates said a year ago, the next outbreak will hit children.
[01:26:27.928 --> 01:26:28.568]  I mean, how?
[01:26:28.708 --> 01:26:30.850]  They're even going to tell us their next move like in pool.
[01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:35.693]  I'm going to put the five solids in the right corner pocket.
[01:26:39.178 --> 01:26:41.419]  Yeah, so I could see RSV.
[01:26:41.459 --> 01:26:45.321]  I could see, I mean, they had probably a million different variants of COVID.
[01:26:45.361 --> 01:26:48.162]  It could be another COVID variant that actually is dangerous for the kids.
[01:26:48.202 --> 01:26:54.444]  And these people are, you know, us as parents, I got, I got a son, a six and a half year old son, and I got a daughter coming in October.
[01:26:55.085 --> 01:27:02.388]  And if you want to, if you want to scare me, you know, you're going to, my kids are going to be very threatened by this next thing that they could roll out.
[01:27:02.408 --> 01:27:04.068]  And then after they roll it out, they lock us down.
[01:27:04.428 --> 01:27:05.829]  They get us to stay inside our houses.
[01:27:06.209 --> 01:27:11.894]  Then they could start crashing the economy, and we won't be none the wiser because we're going to be in our houses for free.
[01:27:11.914 --> 01:27:12.254]  That's right.
[01:27:12.294 --> 01:27:17.058]  They want to bring in their new global ESG system, their new central digital currency.
[01:27:17.699 --> 01:27:18.520]  The time is now.
[01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:27.527]  Their bubble has gotten so big they can't control it, and they want to have the new viral outbreak that targets children so that we will cower.
[01:27:28.508 --> 01:27:32.373]  And all I can say is, I don't know if Bill Gates has got big enough balls.
[01:27:32.833 --> 01:27:35.596]  Because it's going to come out, he killed a bunch of kids, they already have.
[01:27:36.497 --> 01:27:39.581]  I tell you, I wonder if they're going to go that far, but they might.
[01:27:41.062 --> 01:27:44.687]  They're already killing kids in the Maui fires, they have no problem killing us the other way.
[01:27:46.529 --> 01:27:47.670]  You're right brother, thank you for the call.
[01:27:52.088 --> 01:27:54.129]  I'm just really in a moment of disgust right now.
[01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:56.749]  I just am so sick of these people pissing on us.
[01:27:57.649 --> 01:27:59.330]  And so sick of their arrogance.
[01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:01.290]  And just so sick of their evil.
[01:28:02.391 --> 01:28:03.651]  And how they think it's funny.
[01:28:04.891 --> 01:28:06.891]  It's not funny.
[01:28:06.891 --> 01:28:12.891]  I'll say this to Rockefeller and...
[01:28:12.891 --> 01:28:15.891]  Oh, he's dead, but he's got all his family on him.
[01:28:15.694 --> 01:28:17.494]  I'll say this to Fauci and the rest of them.
[01:28:18.515 --> 01:28:19.515]  I'll quote the Godfather.
[01:28:21.018 --> 01:28:25.943]  If a bolt of lightning is to strike anybody in my family, I'm gonna blame you.
[01:28:28.165 --> 01:28:35.391]  And you've already released viruses, you've already pulled this crap, and so that's all I'm saying is, we're reaching the end of the road with you guys.
[01:28:38.214 --> 01:28:39.355]  So, that's it.
[01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:43.479]  Seriously, you psycho demons.
[01:28:43.899 --> 01:28:44.500]  Like, you just...
[01:28:47.438 --> 01:28:50.520]  And the people that go along with you, they think they're like, oh, we're part of the power structure.
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:52.981]  We serve Bill Gates.
[01:28:53.141 --> 01:28:57.423]  You're a frog carrying a scorpion across the river on your back.
[01:28:57.763 --> 01:29:00.164]  And you know what the scorpion does to the other side when you deliver it?
[01:29:01.185 --> 01:29:01.545]  Pow!
[01:29:01.645 --> 01:29:02.265]  He hits you, right?
[01:29:02.846 --> 01:29:05.067]  The frog lays over and he goes, why'd you do that?
[01:29:05.547 --> 01:29:07.268]  And he goes, I'm a scorpion, bitch!
[01:29:09.445 --> 01:29:10.626]  It's the same story of the snake.
[01:29:11.286 --> 01:29:15.068]  They cuddle the snake, bring it over, and also the snake bites you and you're dying.
[01:29:15.368 --> 01:29:16.849]  You go, why did you bite me?
[01:29:17.150 --> 01:29:19.150]  I'm a snake!
[01:29:19.150 --> 01:29:26.509]  Mountain Patriot, Colorado.
[01:29:26.695 --> 01:29:28.136]  Cobra Disaster Capitalism.
[01:29:28.176 --> 01:29:28.476]  Go ahead.
[01:29:28.296 --> 01:29:30.876]  (phone rings)
[01:29:30.876 --> 01:29:33.036]  (screams)
[01:29:33.036 --> 01:29:33.876]  Yeah.
[01:29:33.876 --> 01:29:39.456]  My girl works at the hospital.
[01:29:39.456 --> 01:29:42.115]  Your phone's really distorted, talk right into it.
[01:29:42.115 --> 01:29:48.756]   My girl works at a hospital just outside the Navajo Nation and I told her last week
[01:29:48.756 --> 01:29:50.556]  what you were saying about the masks.
[01:29:50.556 --> 01:29:57.835]   Of course she's very skeptical of you, but sure enough, this week, all my employees
[01:29:57.835 --> 01:29:59.835]  I don't wanna die.
[01:30:00.022 --> 01:30:02.465]  Listen, I want to hear this, but you're too muffled.
[01:30:02.485 --> 01:30:03.926]  So I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:30:04.566 --> 01:30:05.787]  We'll go back to you next hour.
[01:30:05.908 --> 01:30:09.791]  I want to see if you can just, I hate it when calls are like this.
[01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:15.616]  It's like, I think you're on a wireless system or I think you're on a dangle or something or whatever you call it, dongles.
[01:30:16.196 --> 01:30:17.237]  I just know the sound.
[01:30:17.257 --> 01:30:19.820]  No one can understand what you're saying, but I want to hear what you got.
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:23.202]  I heard you say the Navajo Nation's brought back mask.
[01:30:23.403 --> 01:30:24.103]  Is that what I heard?
[01:30:24.504 --> 01:30:25.584]  But I want to hear it loud and clear.
[01:30:25.605 --> 01:30:27.026]  I want to make sure I didn't imagine that.
[01:30:28.712 --> 01:30:36.694]  Roy, Kyle, Patriot Rep, everybody, we're going to get to your calls next hour.
[01:30:37.494 --> 01:30:39.795]  And man, I'm super prepared for this show.
[01:30:40.335 --> 01:30:41.576]  I've covered two stacks here.
[01:30:42.296 --> 01:30:47.897]  At some point, I got to kind of hit all this, but I feel like my lungs have been put through a wood chip or so.
[01:30:50.258 --> 01:30:51.098]  We'll see what happens.
[01:30:51.958 --> 01:30:53.039]  Thanks for putting up with me.
[01:30:53.579 --> 01:30:57.200]  But I'll tell you what allows me to continue operating and going forward.
[01:30:59.275 --> 01:31:02.376]  And I'm so glad, soon as this, I didn't realize this was back this week.
[01:31:02.396 --> 01:31:03.317]  I thought it was next week.
[01:31:03.337 --> 01:31:06.018]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[01:31:07.758 --> 01:31:09.039]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:31:09.999 --> 01:31:12.220]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[01:31:13.841 --> 01:31:14.701]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:31:15.741 --> 01:31:18.422]  Look how full this bottle is.
[01:31:19.883 --> 01:31:21.144]  Right to the top, folks.
[01:31:22.844 --> 01:31:25.525]  Right to the top with these 95% curcuminoid.
[01:31:28.692 --> 01:31:32.335]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[01:31:32.875 --> 01:31:34.937]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[01:31:35.577 --> 01:31:36.058]  This is 95%.
[01:31:37.759 --> 01:31:43.463]  Super constant, so like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[01:31:44.344 --> 01:31:45.024]  It's that powerful.
[01:31:48.487 --> 01:31:48.867]  Or more.
[01:31:50.829 --> 01:31:53.050]  So they're available at infowarstore.com.
[01:31:54.331 --> 01:31:56.253]  Bodies, whole body support.
[01:31:57.381 --> 01:32:13.152]  Your neurological systems, your brain, your heart, all of it is supercharged with what God gave us through turmeric.
[01:32:14.072 --> 01:32:16.314]  And this is the strongest humanoid you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:32:16.974 --> 01:32:18.975]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:32:19.336 --> 01:32:26.336]   Sold out for almost eight months, back in stock at info or store.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:32:26.336 --> 01:32:35.255]  Also, it's got to end today because it's selling out.
[01:32:35.245 --> 01:32:38.367]  X3, Environmental Fusion, are 40% off.
[01:32:39.307 --> 01:32:41.049]  That flash sale has to end today, I'm told.
[01:32:42.129 --> 01:32:43.630]  Super Female Vitality is amazing.
[01:32:43.650 --> 01:32:46.772]  It's the same as Super Male, but Super Male is sold out, so it's a pink label.
[01:32:46.792 --> 01:32:47.893]  It's the same formula.
[01:32:47.913 --> 01:32:49.073]  60% off.
[01:32:49.714 --> 01:32:51.135]  Great stamina, libido, energy.
[01:32:51.815 --> 01:32:54.597]  Super Female Vitality.
[01:32:55.925 --> 01:33:04.130]  And also three great organic fluoride-free toothpaste with essential oils, the turmeric toothpaste, the activated charcoal toothpaste, and the coral calcium toothpaste.
[01:33:04.650 --> 01:33:05.891]  All at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:33:06.131 --> 01:33:13.131]  Please keep us on air.
[01:33:13.131 --> 01:33:27.131]   I've studied how the globalists, how the mad scientists are controlling us.
[01:33:27.532 --> 01:33:30.074]  And they're doing it by keeping us undernourished.
[01:33:30.674 --> 01:33:43.542]  You can eat all the food you want in the world, but if you don't have the essential vitamins and minerals in an organic, absorbable form, if you don't have the key elements like iodine, you are literally like someone in a paddle boat without oars.
[01:33:44.282 --> 01:33:44.903]  Without paddles.
[01:33:45.743 --> 01:33:56.462]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running a flash sale, because we're about to sell out of both of these, of X3 and Vitaminal Fusion in the final days of August.
[01:33:57.023 --> 01:33:57.904]  This is a fundraiser.
[01:33:59.078 --> 01:34:01.678]  I can still sell out of this, I can sell it at full price.
[01:34:01.678 --> 01:34:07.437]   But I want those of you that have been on the fence and never tried X3 or never tried Vitamineral Fusion
[01:34:07.437 --> 01:34:11.878]   to take action and try this product because I know you're going to be blown away
[01:34:11.878 --> 01:34:15.917]  by the energy, the stamina, the focus, the libido.
[01:34:15.917 --> 01:34:17.238]  This is so critical.
[01:34:17.238 --> 01:34:22.757]   Get your X3 and Vitamineral Fusion for 40% off right now at InForestStore.com.
[01:34:22.757 --> 01:34:24.638]  I've been shadow banned.
[01:34:24.638 --> 01:34:26.198]  I've been called a liar.
[01:34:26.573 --> 01:34:29.975]  I've been silenced on virtually every platform created by man.
[01:34:30.696 --> 01:34:32.998]  My life has been threatened, repeatedly.
[01:34:33.598 --> 01:34:36.200]  They've tried to destroy me, but I survived.
[01:34:37.721 --> 01:34:39.723]  And that's why I'm joining Mug Club.
[01:34:41.304 --> 01:34:43.826]  The re-platforming begins now!
[01:34:44.026 --> 01:34:56.419]   Join Mug Club and get one month free with promo code ALEX at jonescrowder.com Tonight, COVID-19 forcing a school district to shut down.
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:05.785]  Runge ISD Southeast of San Antonio is reporting 20% of its teachers and staff have COVID, including the superintendent.
[01:35:06.425 --> 01:35:14.930]  Tonight, as the school leader recovers, he spoke exclusively with KENS5's Elisa Nieves on closing schools after starting just two weeks ago.
[01:35:17.031 --> 01:35:18.091]  Runge, Texas.
[01:35:18.411 --> 01:35:21.412]  A town of fewer than 1,000 people in Carnes County.
[01:35:21.912 --> 01:35:23.573]  Quieter than usual this week.
[01:35:23.693 --> 01:35:26.173]  Saturday afternoon, I began to receive calls.
[01:35:26.273 --> 01:35:30.334]  Runge ISD Superintendent Hector Dominguez says he's been here before.
[01:35:30.354 --> 01:35:32.975]  A surge of COVID cases at the start of school.
[01:35:33.515 --> 01:35:36.396]  But last year, he says, the students got sick.
[01:35:36.716 --> 01:35:38.697]  This year, it's with our employees.
[01:35:38.897 --> 01:35:41.879]  Over the weekend, Dominguez says he took call after call.
[01:35:41.899 --> 01:35:46.661]  So we were up to over 20 percent of our staff that had tested positive.
[01:35:46.701 --> 01:35:48.702]  Ten of his employees had COVID.
[01:35:48.882 --> 01:35:53.885]  I tested myself with my physician, and I too tested positive for COVID.
[01:35:53.905 --> 01:36:00.608]  We're a very, very small school district, and so we don't have the resources that a large district would have to cover classes.
[01:36:01.208 --> 01:36:05.231]  195 students in grades pre-K through 12 make up Runge ISD.
[01:36:05.851 --> 01:36:11.894]  Monday, all of Yellow Jacket Nation received this letter, saying all schools will be closed this week.
[01:36:12.375 --> 01:36:15.336]  That same day, all buildings were sanitized.
[01:36:15.497 --> 01:36:18.838]  It was a no-brainer that it was in the best interest of keeping everyone safe.
[01:36:18.999 --> 01:36:23.541]  Runge ISD operates on a four-day learning schedule, Tuesday through Friday.
[01:36:23.941 --> 01:36:29.945]  Dominguez says they'll soon meet to draft a new instructional calendar to make up the lost days from this week.
[01:36:30.842 --> 01:36:37.029]  Everything will go back to normal in Runge ISD beginning Saturday at the home high school volleyball game.
[01:36:37.429 --> 01:36:39.251]  Monday will be a staff development day.
[01:36:39.612 --> 01:36:41.694]  Students return on Tuesday.
[01:36:42.234 --> 01:36:44.797]  Reporting in Runge, Alicia Nayavis, KENS 5.
[01:36:46.004 --> 01:36:48.304]  Now to the COVID front here in San Antonio.
[01:36:48.344 --> 01:36:55.346]  The city has seen a 30% increase in COVID-19 cases since last week.
[01:36:55.446 --> 01:36:57.746]  1,965 new cases have been reported.
[01:36:58.306 --> 01:37:03.007]  It's still well below last year's numbers and what the city saw during the peak of the pandemic.
[01:37:03.507 --> 01:37:10.548]  MetroHealth says the positivity rate at its facilities is 29%, but so far says not many children have tested positive.
[01:37:10.768 --> 01:37:14.768]   The officials say that could change as we get later on into the school year.
[01:37:14.768 --> 01:37:24.768]   The CDC announced it's tracking a newly discovered strain of COVID-19.
[01:37:24.906 --> 01:37:29.669]  Just four cases have been confirmed so far worldwide, with one of those in Michigan.
[01:37:30.009 --> 01:37:36.975]  The World Health Organization has classified the strain as a, quote, variant under monitoring due to its large number of mutations.
[01:37:37.415 --> 01:37:44.040]  Officials say its mutations could help the virus bypass immunity from prior infections or vaccinations.
[01:37:44.522 --> 01:37:45.063]  That's right.
[01:37:45.103 --> 01:37:49.168]  There's still no reason to be alarmed, but health officials say pay attention.
[01:37:49.248 --> 01:37:51.932]  Many people are traveling, they're getting together.
[01:37:52.052 --> 01:37:59.642]  All of that has fueled an uptick in COVID-19 cases, and rates are increasing at the highest rate right now in the Southwest.
[01:38:01.036 --> 01:38:08.782]  As many enter the last few weeks of a social summer season, it's clear one thing didn't take a break, COVID.
[01:38:09.162 --> 01:38:14.647]  And with fall fast approaching, many are wondering if and when they should get their booster shots.
[01:38:15.107 --> 01:38:19.911]  Everyone will likely meet the criteria to get a new booster.
[01:38:20.531 --> 01:38:20.951]  CBS News.
[01:38:21.052 --> 01:38:27.376]  And don't worry, right after they rolled all this out, Biden announced the new booster is ready for you.
[01:38:31.405 --> 01:38:32.466]  All completely scripted.
[01:38:33.687 --> 01:38:35.328]  The same way they did it three and a half years ago.
[01:38:35.428 --> 01:38:37.809]  Hey, it's not that big a threat, just be ready, be aware.
[01:38:38.009 --> 01:38:38.570]  Oh gosh!
[01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:39.270]  Oh no!
[01:38:39.670 --> 01:38:41.892]  There's no cases of kids, but we gotta close the school!
[01:38:43.673 --> 01:38:44.133]  Oh my gosh!
[01:38:44.173 --> 01:38:45.874]  Somebody tested positive in our business!
[01:38:45.954 --> 01:38:46.375]  Close it!
[01:38:47.695 --> 01:38:50.697]  Which shuts down society, but the big box stores have a plan.
[01:38:50.717 --> 01:38:51.538]  They're gonna stay open.
[01:38:52.218 --> 01:38:53.659]  They'll further consolidate control.
[01:38:53.999 --> 01:38:55.540]  Notice the school day at that school.
[01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:56.361]  Four days now!
[01:38:58.649 --> 01:39:02.951]  And after the next attack, three days, two days, what will the schools be for?
[01:39:03.011 --> 01:39:03.791]  The homeless people.
[01:39:04.872 --> 01:39:05.952]  The re-education camps.
[01:39:06.633 --> 01:39:07.813]  The government command bases.
[01:39:08.274 --> 01:39:12.095]  This is all admitted under State Department of Random 7277 and others.
[01:39:13.176 --> 01:39:14.256]  They figured this all out.
[01:39:14.276 --> 01:39:18.458]  Remember the Taliban used the public schools once they took over as the torture bases.
[01:39:19.959 --> 01:39:21.440]  That's all they are is re-education camps.
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:23.421]  They're getting ready to get rid of it all.
[01:39:23.441 --> 01:39:24.321]  You'll stay in your house.
[01:39:24.681 --> 01:39:25.682]  You'll be pre-programmed there.
[01:39:25.702 --> 01:39:27.583]  When they let you out of your house with a pass, you'll go.
[01:39:28.834 --> 01:39:31.455]  This is their whole plan, but we're here opposing it.
[01:39:31.515 --> 01:39:34.216]  We're here saying no to the ESGs.
[01:39:34.436 --> 01:39:35.777]  No to the New World Order.
[01:39:36.557 --> 01:39:39.498]  You gotta admit the full horror, we're gonna have a chance to beat it.
[01:39:40.379 --> 01:39:41.859]  Your phone calls are coming up in 60 seconds.
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:43.840]  Alright, we're taking your phone calls.
[01:39:44.781 --> 01:39:45.841]  We're totally vindicated.
[01:39:45.861 --> 01:39:49.703]  They rolled out the attempt to launch their new COVID lockdowns.
[01:39:50.914 --> 01:39:52.075]  The public's not buying it.
[01:39:52.575 --> 01:39:55.537]  So they're saying, oh, we're not doing new COVID restrictions, even though we are.
[01:39:56.258 --> 01:39:57.138]  How do we counter this?
[01:39:57.178 --> 01:39:58.239]  What do you think they're going to do next?
[01:39:58.699 --> 01:39:59.560]  How do we respond?
[01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:01.882]  Let's go to Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[01:40:01.902 --> 01:40:02.962]  Mountain Patriot, thanks for calling.
[01:40:03.002 --> 01:40:03.323]  Go ahead.
[01:40:04.824 --> 01:40:08.766]  Is it COVID coming back or is it Merrick disease creeping in?
[01:40:11.428 --> 01:40:12.629]  That's the question I have.
[01:40:14.370 --> 01:40:17.032]  Well, there's all sorts of new viruses they're trying to hit us with.
[01:40:17.072 --> 01:40:18.073]  You want to elaborate on that?
[01:40:19.352 --> 01:40:31.795]  Well, you remember when they tried to vaccinate the chickens for coronavirus, it ended up that the chickens couldn't live without the vaccination after a while.
[01:40:31.935 --> 01:40:32.915]  Because what do they call them?
[01:40:32.975 --> 01:40:33.976]  Leaky vaccines?
[01:40:34.016 --> 01:40:34.936]  They don't work right?
[01:40:35.716 --> 01:40:41.778]  And before long, the chickens can't even live together unless they all get vaccinated continuously.
[01:40:43.098 --> 01:40:47.319]  And then once they give them enough shots, it turns them into a mutant.
[01:40:49.355 --> 01:40:49.615]  Yeah.
[01:40:50.956 --> 01:40:53.438]  And there's plenty of mutants running around right now.
[01:40:53.818 --> 01:40:56.160]  You know, I covered that at Nauseam like three years ago.
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:12.551]  What's the name of the disorder when you give chickens like their third or fourth COVID shot, because it all started with bird flu, and then it causes them to mutate, all their joints get a lot bigger, and they grow tumors everywhere, and then they become immune to it and stay alive, are these giant mutants.
[01:41:13.371 --> 01:41:14.192]  What was that called?
[01:41:15.012 --> 01:41:16.633]  I believe that's the Merrick disease.
[01:41:18.072 --> 01:41:19.073]  That you're talking about.
[01:41:19.113 --> 01:41:21.994]  There was an article about it in National Geographic.
[01:41:22.514 --> 01:41:24.655]  Yes.
[01:41:25.376 --> 01:41:27.537]  On their website.
[01:41:27.577 --> 01:41:28.237]  How do you spell that?
[01:41:28.757 --> 01:41:29.237]  Numerics?
[01:41:30.418 --> 01:41:31.018]  It's Merrick.
[01:41:31.198 --> 01:41:32.259]  M-A-R-E-K.
[01:41:32.279 --> 01:41:36.401]  And you mentioned it, so I looked it up and I've been thinking long and hard about it, believe me.
[01:41:36.441 --> 01:41:37.841]  No, I forgot about Merrick's disease.
[01:41:37.861 --> 01:41:38.662]  Yeah, print that for me.
[01:41:39.909 --> 01:41:42.249]  Yeah, they got similar studies that does that to humans, too.
[01:41:42.610 --> 01:41:47.731]  That's why I want you to take them over and over again because it keeps insulting your immune system until it finally takes you over.
[01:41:47.751 --> 01:41:55.832]  Yeah, and then these morons that keep taking them and taking them, they just become, you know, super spreaders of all these variants.
[01:41:55.932 --> 01:42:00.393]  They're just like big walking Petri dishes without a thought in their head.
[01:42:01.434 --> 01:42:01.994]  And they love it.
[01:42:02.214 --> 01:42:02.914]  They absolutely love it.
[01:42:02.954 --> 01:42:03.314]  Anything else?
[01:42:04.204 --> 01:42:13.587]  I tell you what Alex, I'm just so frustrated and I feel terrible sometimes but some of these people that I just wish they'd take, some of them I wish they'd take more vaccines.
[01:42:13.807 --> 01:42:16.747]  I just, I'm so fed up with it all man.
[01:42:17.308 --> 01:42:42.521]   My gal worked at the hospital outside the Navajo Nation in the ICU and she went through absolute hell and you know probably has PTSD from everything that she saw and went through with all those, with all the breathing apparatus and having You know, the doctors won't even go in the rooms, and she had to lead families up to the window outside the ICU to say goodbye to their loved ones.
[01:42:43.301 --> 01:42:44.562]  Yeah, the doctors are the worst.
[01:42:44.582 --> 01:42:49.807]  They're following orders to suck the 53,000 out, but they won't even go see the person they're murdering.
[01:42:50.628 --> 01:42:51.789]  I'm so angry, man.
[01:42:51.869 --> 01:42:53.010]  I'm so angry.
[01:42:53.030 --> 01:43:01.477]  I don't know what the answer is, other than, you know, trying to wake people up non-violently.
[01:43:02.586 --> 01:43:06.508]  And, you know, it's just, uh, it's unreal.
[01:43:06.668 --> 01:43:08.850]  I don't see any way out of this right now.
[01:43:09.970 --> 01:43:10.330]  But, yeah.
[01:43:10.370 --> 01:43:19.235]  Well, remember, they would take infected people and put them in there where the old people are nursing home, but family couldn't come see their loved one because they wanted to quietly murder them.
[01:43:19.616 --> 01:43:23.958]  And whether you were in Europe or Australia or the U.S., it was the same policy.
[01:43:24.298 --> 01:43:26.159]  All directed by the same people.
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:27.600]  That's the big giveaway.
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:28.821]  Thank you, Mountain Patriot.
[01:43:30.265 --> 01:43:32.305]  Roy in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:43:33.926 --> 01:43:34.786]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:43:35.026 --> 01:43:35.726]  Good, thanks for holding.
[01:43:37.546 --> 01:43:40.287]  So, I want to call in about COVID.
[01:43:41.307 --> 01:43:45.308]  I'm agreeing with you that the N95, it just doesn't work.
[01:43:45.628 --> 01:43:53.230]  We learned back in school before we went into the hospital that even an N95 still allows 5% nanoparticles.
[01:43:56.067 --> 01:44:01.610]  Even if you had a perfect seal, you couldn't stop the virus from getting through into your system.
[01:44:02.410 --> 01:44:08.994]  And so the whole mask thing is really, unless you can live in a bubble and get air a different way, you can't really stop from getting a virus.
[01:44:10.195 --> 01:44:15.457]  And so the virus, you know, it causes basically a constant chronic inflammation.
[01:44:16.118 --> 01:44:22.061]  I got it back in 2020 and I've had to deal with complications with it all the way up even till today.
[01:44:23.135 --> 01:44:28.617]  And so you get sort of a chronic inflammation, and you get sort of an asthmatic effect from it.
[01:44:29.018 --> 01:44:29.278]  Yes.
[01:44:29.358 --> 01:44:38.281]  So when it gets really bad for me, I have no problem whatsoever taking even more than one shot of Palmaquart if I need to.
[01:44:38.321 --> 01:44:42.203]  There were times when it was so bad, I would take three shots of Palmaquart.
[01:44:42.763 --> 01:44:47.565]  If you got the liquid Palmaquart, and you can use a nebulizer, it'll work a whole lot better.
[01:44:48.186 --> 01:44:56.599]   But if you've got the powder form called Advair, That also helps, but you seem to need more of it if you use
[01:44:56.599 --> 01:44:58.207]  the powdered form.
[01:44:58.207 --> 01:45:03.887]   I would recommend people get a nebulized machine and get the liquid form of palmacort.
[01:45:03.887 --> 01:45:09.608]   And if you have to take two, three to get your inflammation down and keep you out of
[01:45:09.608 --> 01:45:10.608]  the emergency room.
[01:45:10.608 --> 01:45:14.929]   And by the way, you're really important, Paul and Roy, because there were two camps here,
[01:45:14.929 --> 01:45:20.807]   people that said it's the most deadly virus ever, kills 3.4%, or those that said, oh,
[01:45:20.807 --> 01:45:21.807]  it's not real.
[01:45:21.807 --> 01:45:24.809]  I'm tough, I'm on a hypochondriac.
[01:45:24.816 --> 01:45:25.956]  I hardly ever get sick.
[01:45:26.436 --> 01:45:27.277]  This was different.
[01:45:27.657 --> 01:45:34.759]  I was huffing steroids, taking all the stuff, and if I didn't know that it was inflammation and psychological, I'd have gone to the hospital, I'd have died.
[01:45:35.159 --> 01:45:41.160]  So you work as a respiratory therapist, and you're saying you've never seen anything like this?
[01:45:42.101 --> 01:45:43.401]  No, this is definitely different.
[01:45:44.421 --> 01:45:59.021]   We've had all kinds of different ways of people getting pneumonia in hospitals before, and you know, we've had people before the whole COVID thing came out, You know, there were different reasons why people ended up with pneumonia and ended up on ventilators.
[01:45:59.702 --> 01:46:12.609]  But then, as soon as they released this virus, which I believe is an attack too, I think it's been manipulated, even myself, but when they released this, it was like that was the only thing that existed.
[01:46:12.969 --> 01:46:15.110]  There wasn't any other, there was nothing else.
[01:46:15.793 --> 01:46:19.152]   out there and even the doctors that's all they would say everybody had was
[01:46:19.152 --> 01:46:22.393]   COVID. I'm like well how's that possible? I'm like we had all kinds of different
[01:46:22.393 --> 01:46:26.913]   things that caused pneumonia before even bacterial pneumonia. Oh there's no doubt
[01:46:26.913 --> 01:46:31.593]   they boosted the numbers of it no doubt they did that but but separately you're
[01:46:31.593 --> 01:46:38.233]   saying you did see something different physiologically from COVID. Yes yes
[01:46:38.233 --> 01:46:41.593]  because it just wouldn't stop.
[01:46:39.735 --> 01:46:41.916]  The inflammation keeps coming back and coming back.
[01:46:41.956 --> 01:46:49.378]  It's almost like a virus that you can't... Well, I mean, I'm not a medical worker like you are, but I've interviewed literally hundreds of doctors.
[01:46:49.818 --> 01:46:58.880]  It is a prion, isolated nanotech viral particle that keeps replicating, just like the thing that causes mad cow disease.
[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:00.300]  And so that's what it is.
[01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:02.141]  That's why it just keeps coming back.
[01:47:03.061 --> 01:47:05.722]  Yeah, plus it's an RNA virus, not a DNA virus.
[01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:10.816]  An RNA virus like HIV can be prolonged.
[01:47:10.836 --> 01:47:15.283]  It can be manipulated in a way where it's very difficult for the body to fight it off.
[01:47:15.788 --> 01:47:29.792]  So they intentionally used something that they knew that you wouldn't be able to fly it off easily, and if they gave it longevity by splicing in something like HIV or just some crazy thing they could have spliced in there, then it's almost impossible to beat.
[01:47:29.832 --> 01:47:34.113]  I mean, you'll go through phases of feeling better, then you'll feel worse, then you'll feel better, then you'll feel worse.
[01:47:34.473 --> 01:47:38.655]  And they did splice in the HIV delivery system.
[01:47:38.695 --> 01:47:39.275]  They did do that.
[01:47:40.155 --> 01:47:44.525]   Yeah, and I wonder, you know, if some people Well, that's it.
[01:47:44.545 --> 01:47:46.907]  They colonized this with a chimeric, self-replicating infection.
[01:47:46.927 --> 01:47:50.349]  There are ways to mitigate it, but it's reducing everybody's lifespan.
[01:47:50.369 --> 01:47:51.349]  It's infected everybody.
[01:47:51.409 --> 01:47:53.130]  And again, what was Fauci's specialty?
[01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:59.809]   Well that's it, they colonized us with a chimeric self-replicating infection.
[01:47:59.809 --> 01:48:06.729]   There are ways to mitigate it, but it's reducing everybody's lifespan, it's infected everybody.
[01:48:06.729 --> 01:48:08.289]  What was Fauci's specialty?
[01:48:08.289 --> 01:48:09.610]  HIV.
[01:48:09.610 --> 01:48:10.849]  What is Bill Gates' specialty?
[01:48:10.901 --> 01:48:11.321]  HIV.
[01:48:11.881 --> 01:48:21.985]  So they hit us with this thing that's very hard to track that affects each person differently and it's just that it's we're literally living we're living in Hitler 2.0 right now.
[01:48:23.126 --> 01:48:40.373]   I'll tell you what you really know that you're dealing with the problem is and I'll say this is something I've noticed I recognized in me and some people I've talked to if you lie down flat on your back and it seems to get worse It's because that chronic inflammation that you've been dealing with for a while has done so much damage to your lungs that it's weakened your lungs.
[01:48:40.433 --> 01:48:41.494]  I don't have a name for that.
[01:48:41.554 --> 01:48:44.095]  I just myself call it weakened lung syndrome.
[01:48:44.516 --> 01:48:52.220]  There's no real name for it, but I've gotten to the point to where I've had inflammation so much to where I have to use like a CPAP when I lay flat on my back.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:54.681]  It's the only way that I can breathe better.
[01:48:55.746 --> 01:49:00.988]  And like you, I take Ivermectin and I take some of the other stuff too.
[01:49:01.449 --> 01:49:03.069]  Same thing happened to me after COVID.
[01:49:03.089 --> 01:49:03.810]  I've never been the same.
[01:49:04.130 --> 01:49:05.130]  Can't sleep on my back now.
[01:49:06.091 --> 01:49:07.511]  Because I wake up gasping for air.
[01:49:08.532 --> 01:49:11.513]  Yeah, if I don't put a, I got to put a nasal CPAP on my nose.
[01:49:12.414 --> 01:49:18.636]  It's the only way that I can actually lay flat on my back and go to sleep now because of all the damage that's been done to my lungs from the inflammation.
[01:49:19.957 --> 01:49:33.276]   And so, you know, it's, It's kind of crazy, but you also need albuterol, too, because there's also, you know, I went in there to the doctor and he diagnosed me with RAD, reactive airway disease.
[01:49:34.017 --> 01:49:37.098]  And, you know, he just prescribed me albuterol for that.
[01:49:37.178 --> 01:49:39.660]  But there's more to it than just reactive airway disease.
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:41.581]  That's just saying that you've got a form of asthma.
[01:49:42.438 --> 01:49:43.938]  And nobody in my family's ever had it.
[01:49:43.999 --> 01:49:44.659]  I've never had it.
[01:49:45.299 --> 01:49:46.039]  It's obvious.
[01:49:46.119 --> 01:49:47.880]  Nobody in my family's ever had asthma.
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:54.402]  And I was thinking last night, when I woke up in the morning, I was like, man, this COVID gave me asthma.
[01:49:56.802 --> 01:50:12.107]  Well, I'll tell you what, I feel better though, when I go out in the sun and I get some natural sunlight on me, you know, if I, if I go out there and do that, I also, and I don't recommend this for everybody, but I remember you had a doctor on there was talking about how the virus stays in the back of the nose and in that area.
[01:50:12.802 --> 01:50:17.524]  And if you can't get rid of it back there, you know, it also can cause more trouble.
[01:50:18.405 --> 01:50:27.129]  And so I tried... I wouldn't recommend this for anybody, but I put a little bit of your immune support in my nebulizer after the inflammation's gone.
[01:50:27.149 --> 01:50:30.050]  I wouldn't recommend using that while you've got the inflammation.
[01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:38.714]  But I put a little bit of that in my nebulizer and I nebulized that in through my nose and tried to kill some of the virus that keeps coming up.
[01:50:38.794 --> 01:50:40.895]  It seems to help a little bit, you know, but...
[01:50:41.334 --> 01:50:43.564]  I don't necessarily recommend that for everybody.
[01:50:48.311 --> 01:50:50.953]  A lot of different disinfectants that are out there.
[01:50:51.133 --> 01:50:52.513]  We had Peter McCullough on a few weeks ago.
[01:50:52.533 --> 01:50:53.094]  He talked about it.
[01:50:53.114 --> 01:50:53.954]  We had some other people on.
[01:50:54.595 --> 01:50:59.818]  And they were talking about, it's just mouthwashes too are really, really important.
[01:50:59.838 --> 01:51:03.380]  But yeah, this is a thing that colonizes the nasal cavity.
[01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:07.262]  It's a crystal, basically a protein crystal, and it keeps growing back.
[01:51:07.322 --> 01:51:11.264]  It's a synthetic virus made in a lab, growing back, growing back, growing back.
[01:51:11.684 --> 01:51:13.586]  And so it starts here and it goes into your mouth.
[01:51:14.898 --> 01:51:18.779]  Your tonsils, your throat, your lungs, over and over again.
[01:51:18.819 --> 01:51:19.459]  Thank you, Roy.
[01:51:20.159 --> 01:51:24.941]  And for some people, it hits the liver, it hits the testicles, it hits the kidneys.
[01:51:25.001 --> 01:51:29.862]  I mean, they stood this thing up, they made it, and they released it on us.
[01:51:30.362 --> 01:51:31.802]  And they're just laughing their ass off.
[01:51:32.622 --> 01:51:34.003]  This is a bunch of psychotic demons.
[01:51:35.123 --> 01:51:39.484]  And it's just important to realize that, that that's who runs our government.
[01:51:40.604 --> 01:51:42.205]  And they did it.
[01:51:43.246 --> 01:51:44.386]  And I've got all the videos.
[01:51:45.486 --> 01:51:48.307]  They want us to just move on to the next story, which I've kind of done.
[01:51:48.327 --> 01:51:58.669]  I can pull Fauci up two years before they release COVID saying, we're going to release a virus out of China, a bird flu, to blow up the old system and take control of everybody and bring in mRNA.
[01:51:59.989 --> 01:52:01.489]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[01:52:01.849 --> 01:52:08.270]  And just like Senator Paul points out, I've got all your hearings, he says, you have these big meetings called gain of function conference.
[01:52:10.251 --> 01:52:12.151]  And then you say you don't know what gain of function is.
[01:52:14.008 --> 01:52:17.090]  And you look at Fauci, he's obviously a psychotic demon.
[01:52:18.571 --> 01:52:20.512]  And he does just what he looks like he'd do.
[01:52:24.374 --> 01:52:25.455]  He's the big predator.
[01:52:25.855 --> 01:52:27.496]  We're the little sheep, there's too many of us.
[01:52:28.057 --> 01:52:31.939]  And he's willing to come in and call everybody for the betterment of humanity.
[01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:33.300]  That's his idea.
[01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:39.084]  But if you try to make a move on him, whoo boy, that's, ooh, that's supermax prison.
[01:52:40.111 --> 01:52:41.672]  Fauci's allowed to hurt you.
[01:52:42.332 --> 01:52:44.154]  You're not allowed to even talk bad about him.
[01:52:44.914 --> 01:52:45.895]  He's the anointed one.
[01:52:46.315 --> 01:52:47.956]  You lay down, you die.
[01:52:48.356 --> 01:52:49.117]  Okay, good.
[01:52:49.277 --> 01:52:49.797]  That's good.
[01:52:50.017 --> 01:52:50.497]  That's right.
[01:52:50.798 --> 01:52:51.458]  He's the boss.
[01:52:51.498 --> 01:52:51.998]  Good for you.
[01:52:53.179 --> 01:52:54.460]  Kyle in Kansas.
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:54.900]  You're on the air.
[01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:55.501]  Thanks for calling.
[01:52:55.521 --> 01:52:59.183]  Hey, Alex.
[01:52:59.283 --> 01:52:59.923]  Quick plug.
[01:53:00.223 --> 01:53:02.765]  Your CBD, best I've ever had.
[01:53:03.065 --> 01:53:04.626]  I've been taking CBD for years.
[01:53:04.986 --> 01:53:11.958]   Tried a bunch of different kinds, and by far, hands down, Info Wars, Best CBD.
[01:53:12.198 --> 01:53:14.479]  Is that the Rebels In?
[01:53:15.859 --> 01:53:17.940]  Well, I just got an order of Rebels In.
[01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:21.220]  I haven't tried it yet, but this is the thousand milligram.
[01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:26.421]  I do the tincture, and I've gone through about three bottles of that.
[01:53:26.901 --> 01:53:31.542]  And so when you just came out with the Rebels In, I just put in an order, just showed up.
[01:53:32.443 --> 01:53:33.303]  It's even stronger.
[01:53:33.323 --> 01:53:36.483]  The other one's great as well, but it's even stronger.
[01:53:36.503 --> 01:53:38.084]  Awesome.
[01:53:38.144 --> 01:53:38.724]  I can't wait, Alex.
[01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:43.573]  Well, I want to talk about a little big picture here.
[01:53:43.613 --> 01:53:56.963]  What I think, what they're doing right now that really got their hand on the dial on these future shock, Tavistock Institute type of attacks that are going on.
[01:53:57.003 --> 01:53:57.783]  You just look at it.
[01:53:58.104 --> 01:53:59.465]  You got the virus attacks.
[01:53:59.865 --> 01:54:01.166]  You got the food attacks.
[01:54:01.206 --> 01:54:02.487]  You got the energy attacks.
[01:54:02.907 --> 01:54:04.008]  The inflation attacks.
[01:54:04.088 --> 01:54:05.309]  The weather attacks.
[01:54:06.069 --> 01:54:08.091]  The different groups that they incite.
[01:54:08.658 --> 01:54:11.439]  Trying to fight each other, getting everybody at each other.
[01:54:11.459 --> 01:54:20.282]  And all of these are just attacks, just like you lay down artillery to soften up your target.
[01:54:21.403 --> 01:54:22.943]  And before you really go in.
[01:54:23.163 --> 01:54:26.725]  And hopefully, what the idea is, you just walk right in afterward.
[01:54:27.305 --> 01:54:31.987]  Everybody's demoralized, dazed, just beaten down.
[01:54:32.367 --> 01:54:34.928]  And that's what we're going through, is what I feel like.
[01:54:35.735 --> 01:54:36.035]  I agree.
[01:54:36.075 --> 01:54:42.938]  They're opening up the artillery ahead of the central bank, the digital currencies.
[01:54:43.119 --> 01:54:51.522]  First they'll soften us up, then offer themselves as saviors, and then as soon as they get the handcuffs on us digitally, they're going to kill basically everybody.
[01:54:51.542 --> 01:54:52.983]  That's it.
[01:54:53.003 --> 01:54:53.864]  You've got to be aware.
[01:54:54.584 --> 01:54:56.925]  I tell people, be aware of the solutions.
[01:54:56.985 --> 01:55:03.116]   Look out for, you know, Anytime they offer a solution, you know, what's their end goal?
[01:55:03.176 --> 01:55:04.577]  You know, you tie it back to 9-11.
[01:55:04.677 --> 01:55:06.738]  It's like, well, what did they get in the end?
[01:55:07.118 --> 01:55:08.299]  Well, they got the Patriot Act.
[01:55:08.659 --> 01:55:11.040]  They got 20 years of war.
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:14.262]  So all you got to do is just say, well, step back.
[01:55:14.302 --> 01:55:15.903]  What did they get with the... Well, that's right.
[01:55:15.923 --> 01:55:21.345]  I mean, if you get evil people in charge and they have the administrative power, they can do incredible things.
[01:55:22.026 --> 01:55:23.567]  Maui's a microcosm of that.
[01:55:24.167 --> 01:55:25.027]  Don't give them water.
[01:55:25.107 --> 01:55:25.968]  Don't trim the trees.
[01:55:26.008 --> 01:55:26.828]  Leave the power on.
[01:55:27.229 --> 01:55:27.769]  Order the cops.
[01:55:29.011 --> 01:55:31.073]  Whole people in the town?
[01:55:31.093 --> 01:55:31.834]  You know what would happen.
[01:55:32.835 --> 01:55:36.458]  And then you've got the cops, who aren't even part of it, doing your dirty work now.
[01:55:37.489 --> 01:55:43.353]  So the public goes, well forgive them, they didn't know, but now they're not calling for an investigation that goes all the way up.
[01:55:43.734 --> 01:55:46.956]  So they know our nature, they know we love to take it.
[01:55:46.996 --> 01:55:49.518]  Larry Fink knows we love for him to kill us.
[01:55:50.078 --> 01:55:52.740]  We love for him to rape us and rob us, and he wants to do it.
[01:55:53.541 --> 01:55:55.682]  He just sees us as trash to be taken out.
[01:55:56.203 --> 01:55:58.945]  As disgusting cockroaches eating his pie.
[01:55:58.965 --> 01:56:01.627]  And it's very, very sad, I appreciate your call.
[01:56:03.068 --> 01:56:04.589]  And maybe Larry Fink's better than everybody.
[01:56:05.506 --> 01:56:06.947]  Maybe he is a god.
[01:56:07.787 --> 01:56:09.148]  We're here just to die in his wake.
[01:56:10.008 --> 01:56:10.848]  We sure act like it.
[01:56:12.069 --> 01:56:12.289]  Some.
[01:56:13.089 --> 01:56:18.932]  But know this, you can be a doctor, you can be a school teacher, you can be an FBI agent, Larry Fink's gonna kill you too.
[01:56:21.073 --> 01:56:22.333]  Clashwab's gonna kill you too.
[01:56:23.734 --> 01:56:26.175]  So you pretend you're part of the power structure, you're gonna die too.
[01:56:26.995 --> 01:56:28.756]  They're gonna slowly cut your resources off too.
[01:56:30.257 --> 01:56:30.877]  So just know that.
[01:56:32.438 --> 01:56:32.978]  Enjoy yourself.
[01:56:33.919 --> 01:56:35.960]  Let's talk to Patriot Rep in Ohio.
[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:36.840]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:56:38.081 --> 01:56:39.781]  Hey Alex, it's great talking to you, man.
[01:56:41.282 --> 01:56:43.422]  I gotta tell you, I'm one of your biggest supporters.
[01:56:44.763 --> 01:56:46.944]  I'm running for 2nd District out here in Ohio.
[01:56:47.224 --> 01:56:47.604]  Beautiful.
[01:56:48.664 --> 01:56:55.027]  And I've actually got a link straight on my website at PatriotRep.com to go straight to Band Top Video.
[01:56:55.647 --> 01:56:58.768]  I'm also gonna put up one also for you just for InfoWars Store.
[01:56:59.423 --> 01:57:03.706]  And I didn't want to get off topic earlier with you about the Maui.
[01:57:03.766 --> 01:57:08.169]  I know you're talking about the COVID vaccine rollout and all that.
[01:57:08.710 --> 01:57:11.212]  And the reason I didn't say anything about the COVID vaccine, because you know what?
[01:57:11.332 --> 01:57:12.072]  I'm not buying it.
[01:57:12.192 --> 01:57:13.173]  I'm not taking no shots.
[01:57:13.713 --> 01:57:15.275]  And people are awake.
[01:57:15.515 --> 01:57:16.375]  They're not going to take them.
[01:57:16.736 --> 01:57:17.516]  We're not going to take them.
[01:57:17.536 --> 01:57:21.279]  But to try to talk to people, to explain to people, they don't even want to hear it.
[01:57:21.829 --> 01:57:23.430]  They do not want to listen.
[01:57:23.810 --> 01:57:25.350]  They don't want to hear the other side.
[01:57:26.291 --> 01:57:30.252]  So to my point, there's no point in even trying to talk to these people anymore.
[01:57:30.872 --> 01:57:41.857]  But my question, what nobody has addressed, as I know that on the Maui fires, Alex, they talk about all these kids that are missing.
[01:57:42.837 --> 01:57:45.398]  My question is, where are these kids' parents?
[01:57:46.499 --> 01:57:47.560]  Where are these kids' uncles?
[01:57:47.780 --> 01:57:48.661]  Well, that's it.
[01:57:49.742 --> 01:57:56.548]  Whole families burn up and are dead, and they don't want people to know because then they can get the property since the whole family's dead.
[01:57:57.489 --> 01:58:03.534]  Yeah, but where are the outspoken, I mean, where are the grandmothers, the uncles that live in other states?
[01:58:03.994 --> 01:58:05.816]  Where is the outcry from these people?
[01:58:06.457 --> 01:58:07.878]  Where are they?
[01:58:07.918 --> 01:58:09.379]  We've been trained to submit.
[01:58:11.121 --> 01:58:12.302]  And so that's a good question.
[01:58:13.769 --> 01:58:20.151]  That's why there's a 12-mile exclusion zone, because if grandma wants to come find their daughter, well, grandma's not allowed in.
[01:58:20.771 --> 01:58:22.072]  We just killed your daughter, lady.
[01:58:22.092 --> 01:58:23.272]  You're not gonna come talk to your daughter.
[01:58:23.572 --> 01:58:24.633]  We just killed your grandkids.
[01:58:24.653 --> 01:58:25.453]  We killed your wife.
[01:58:26.093 --> 01:58:26.833]  We killed your husband.
[01:58:26.853 --> 01:58:27.834]  We killed your ass.
[01:58:28.514 --> 01:58:29.774]  She just lay down and take it.
[01:58:29.814 --> 01:58:32.795]  That's why they kept him out, so they can't come find out where their family went.
[01:58:33.215 --> 01:58:36.636]  They can't go to their house and find them burned up and dead, or find them burned up and dead in a car.
[01:58:37.037 --> 01:58:41.178]  FEMA's gonna bulldoze all that out while they're selling $1,000 a night at the Bill Gates Hotel.
[01:58:42.354 --> 01:58:45.354]   We need people out there on the ground to get these people heard.
[01:58:45.354 --> 01:58:47.354]  You know, get these families heard.
[01:58:47.354 --> 01:58:49.354]  We don't even know where our kids are.
[01:58:49.354 --> 01:58:51.354]  We don't know where our granddaughters are.
[01:58:51.354 --> 01:58:53.354]  We don't know where my daughter is.
[01:58:53.354 --> 01:58:55.354]  But I appreciate all the work you're doing.
[01:58:55.354 --> 01:58:59.354]  Are you saying you've got family in Maui?
[01:58:59.354 --> 01:59:00.354]  No, no, no, no.
[01:59:00.354 --> 01:59:06.354]   I'm just saying, you know, that everybody that, you know, all the people that died in Maui,
[01:59:07.086 --> 01:59:12.286]   God be with them, but I'm just saying, people that don't live in Maui, that have people
[01:59:12.286 --> 01:59:15.405]  live in Maui, where are they at?
[01:59:15.405 --> 01:59:21.445]   You don't hear them on any talk shows or anything saying, "Hey man, I couldn't get to my kids.
[01:59:21.445 --> 01:59:22.445]  I can't see my kids.
[01:59:22.445 --> 01:59:23.445]  They won't tell me nothing."
[01:59:23.445 --> 01:59:24.445]  You don't hear about them.
[01:59:24.445 --> 01:59:25.445]  No, I hear you.
[01:59:25.445 --> 01:59:28.086]   And listen, I need to go to Maui, and I appreciate your call.
[01:59:28.086 --> 01:59:34.166]   I'm going to have to reach out to an outside media company to actually fund me to go.
[01:59:34.207 --> 01:59:41.594]  Because there's a limited travel budget here, and I thought I controlled info wars, I don't.
[01:59:41.955 --> 01:59:48.321]  So we do Patriot Award shows, and we do Barton Springs events, and we do Las Vegas events.
[01:59:49.022 --> 01:59:52.285]  So there's no money for me to go cover this mass murder.
[01:59:53.875 --> 02:00:00.100]  And I'm not mad because there's a CRO who's not really connected to it and the crew kind of does what they want.
[02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:01.000]  So that's fine.
[02:00:01.481 --> 02:00:09.728]  I'm gonna go and I'm gonna get outside funding outside of InfoWars and I'm gonna go to Maui and I'm gonna cover it for someone else.
[02:00:10.568 --> 02:00:14.331]  I'm being basically forced out of InfoWars and it's okay.
[02:00:15.352 --> 02:00:17.694]  But that's why I got one foot out the door.
[02:00:17.814 --> 02:00:19.736]  I've really tried to stabilize this place.
[02:00:20.416 --> 02:00:34.010]   I've really tried to work with people but It's just that it's a whole other world in that it's not even the management that's the issue.
[02:00:34.090 --> 02:00:37.631]  It's just that sometimes things get long in the tooth.
[02:00:38.772 --> 02:00:39.912]  They just get long in the tooth.
[02:00:40.973 --> 02:00:44.734]  And people love award shows.
[02:00:44.774 --> 02:00:45.355]  They love it.
[02:00:45.475 --> 02:00:46.595]  I will never be part of it.
[02:00:47.596 --> 02:00:50.257]  In fact, I'm not doing any stadium events, any award shows.
[02:00:50.557 --> 02:00:52.558]  I'd rather be executed than be part of that.
[02:00:53.963 --> 02:00:56.404]  Because it doesn't do anything.
[02:00:57.645 --> 02:00:58.405]  It does nothing.
[02:01:00.366 --> 02:01:06.369]  And... But people don't agree with me around here.
[02:01:09.411 --> 02:01:11.672]  And I don't know how I'm not in control of my own company.
[02:01:12.012 --> 02:01:12.552]  I'll be honest.
[02:01:13.613 --> 02:01:14.253]  I'm not in control.
[02:01:15.694 --> 02:01:21.036]  It's like... There could be a flying saucers attack in New York City next week.
[02:01:21.236 --> 02:01:22.277]  There'll be no budget for that.
[02:01:23.507 --> 02:01:29.310]  But, there's an award show, you better damn believe will be there, that no one watches, nobody cares about.
[02:01:29.330 --> 02:01:31.771]  And I'm not even against that.
[02:01:31.931 --> 02:01:37.214]  It's fine, like, I'll leave here, and InfoWars can be one endless award show.
[02:01:37.834 --> 02:01:39.755]  Just 24-7, like Hollywood.
[02:01:39.935 --> 02:01:41.516]  We'll have Oscars and stuff, you know?
[02:01:42.497 --> 02:01:43.597]  We'll do that for everybody.
[02:01:44.217 --> 02:01:45.238]  But I'll be long gone.
[02:01:45.898 --> 02:01:46.739]  Long gone.
[02:01:48.079 --> 02:01:49.980]  And so, I probably shouldn't be on air today.
[02:01:50.581 --> 02:01:52.902]  Because I don't feel well, I'll be absolutely honest with everybody.
[02:01:54.130 --> 02:02:01.599]  But, uh, I'll be damned to hell before I'm ever part of some award show or some Vegas thing, you know, where everybody struts around all day long.
[02:02:01.619 --> 02:02:03.221]  And I'm not even against all that kind of crap.
[02:02:03.601 --> 02:02:05.684]  It's just that we got serious fish to fry here.
[02:02:06.725 --> 02:02:07.726]  Serious fish to fry.
[02:02:11.211 --> 02:02:11.671]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:11.691 --> 02:02:12.032]  Stay with us.
[02:02:13.812 --> 02:02:18.935]  Americans have just had a major victory against the globalist tyrants.
[02:02:19.695 --> 02:02:26.038]  And this victory, if people pay attention, can be a model of defeating their future operations.
[02:02:26.058 --> 02:02:28.039]  So please listen to me clearly.
[02:02:28.759 --> 02:02:40.085]  If you remember about 10 days ago, I came out and said, according to my sources inside the federal government, they've been told that new COVID protocols are going to be rolled back out starting September 15th.
[02:02:41.047 --> 02:02:44.588]  through December and into next year for the election.
[02:02:45.108 --> 02:02:52.251]  They were told first masking for TSA employees and other airport employees and that Biden would then do a mandate middle of October.
[02:02:52.691 --> 02:02:56.232]  Now that's what they were told right after I reported that news.
[02:02:57.182 --> 02:03:13.609]  And the reason my story went so viral was because suddenly the same afternoon they rolled out a huge PR campaign that hospitals are shutting back down and colleges are making you wear masks and some public schools are closing and do the protocols need to come back?
[02:03:13.989 --> 02:03:19.952]  Whether you were in Australia, the UK, Canada, the US, it was the same PR.
[02:03:20.012 --> 02:03:20.832]  So I announced this.
[02:03:21.385 --> 02:03:30.132]  In the first hour of my morning show on Friday, two Fridays ago, and then by five o'clock that evening, they had their full rollout pushing it.
[02:03:30.712 --> 02:03:43.383]  Since then, Biden has come out and said he wants multiple millions of dollars for a new COVID vaccine that's coming out September 15th, same date the TSA whistleblower told me they were going to have masks put back on.
[02:03:44.043 --> 02:03:45.825]  So there was a huge backlash to this.
[02:03:46.892 --> 02:03:59.142]  And now the White House, the CDC, and the TSA as well have all come out and said, no, we don't have any plans to go back to lockdowns.
[02:04:00.353 --> 02:04:03.635]  And then they have the fact checkers that, by the way, are funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:04:03.675 --> 02:04:04.276]  Isn't that funny?
[02:04:04.856 --> 02:04:07.638]  Saying, oh, Jones said lockdowns by the fall.
[02:04:08.278 --> 02:04:13.302]  No, I said they'd like to get back to full COVID protocols is what I was told by December.
[02:04:13.642 --> 02:04:15.963]  But the key here is they'd like to.
[02:04:16.464 --> 02:04:22.488]  In my original announcement that went viral, in that little five minute clip, I said, we have a chance to stop this.
[02:04:23.068 --> 02:04:25.029]  They lied to us about masks being effective.
[02:04:25.049 --> 02:04:27.651]  They lied to us about the origin of the virus.
[02:04:27.951 --> 02:04:30.253]  They lied to us about the so-called vaccines working.
[02:04:30.253 --> 02:04:35.253]   that aren't even vaccines, that are gene therapies, that erase your immune system.
[02:04:35.253 --> 02:04:39.723]   They lied to us at every level about, "Oh, if you take the shot, you're protected and you can't
[02:04:39.723 --> 02:04:40.253]  spread it."
[02:04:40.253 --> 02:04:45.253]   Ladies and gentlemen, I got a call yesterday, an individual was in town,
[02:04:45.253 --> 02:04:52.253]  and they are a high-level manager in the TSA.
[02:04:52.253 --> 02:04:55.253]  And they said, "You gotta warn people."
[02:04:56.040 --> 02:05:09.710]  Whistleblowers from TSA and Border Patrol have raised the alarm to InfoWars that the Biden administration is setting the stage for full COVID lockdowns that will begin with incremental restrictions like masking TSA employees in mid-September.
[02:05:10.131 --> 02:05:17.697]  Then, by the middle of October, they are going to say that everyone flying has to wear a mask.
[02:05:19.738 --> 02:05:24.491]   And in the meetings, people began to ask them, Well, I mean, why is this happening?
[02:05:24.511 --> 02:05:35.841]  They said, well, because of the new variant in Canada, and because of the WHO, they may, you know, declare this, but regardless, we've been told this is going to happen.
[02:05:37.466 --> 02:05:37.886]  Bloomy!
[02:05:37.986 --> 02:05:46.750]  Scientists called people to start wearing COVID masks again as they sound alarm of a new variant, AB16, that has lots of new mutations.
[02:05:46.810 --> 02:05:47.490]  Print that for me.
[02:05:47.910 --> 02:05:56.934]  And then they were told, we expect by December a return to the full COVID protocol of 2020-2021.
[02:05:59.318 --> 02:06:04.300]  That's two federal agents that told me this yesterday.
[02:06:04.820 --> 02:06:10.022]  And then I went and looked at the news, and there they were saying Canada's looking at new restrictions again because of the variant.
[02:06:10.102 --> 02:06:11.243]  And so is the EU.
[02:06:12.083 --> 02:06:14.084]  And what did the Russians just put out three days ago?
[02:06:14.624 --> 02:06:14.884]  U.S.
[02:06:14.944 --> 02:06:18.986]  is plotting another pandemic, Russian head of the defense ministry warns.
[02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:23.121]  Now, new lockdowns will starve the third world.
[02:06:23.221 --> 02:06:24.902]  New lockdowns will destroy small businesses.
[02:06:24.942 --> 02:06:32.646]  New lockdowns will take the average person that's already $5,000 in the hole, and their paycheck is just on time.
[02:06:33.026 --> 02:06:34.647]  We'll put them into full bankruptcy.
[02:06:35.827 --> 02:06:43.091]  And the children in the mask, in the attempt to push a new shot with a new variant, and we're right back in the same hellhole.
[02:06:45.632 --> 02:06:49.214]  We were in just a few years ago.
[02:06:50.154 --> 02:06:51.555]  And why is it perfect timing?
[02:06:51.736 --> 02:06:57.120]  Because going to the election year, they had the last crisis go over two and a half years.
[02:06:57.140 --> 02:06:59.863]  They'll bare minimum run this through the next election.
[02:07:00.904 --> 02:07:06.089]  It's only 14, 15 months out with mail-in ballots again.
[02:07:06.109 --> 02:07:11.073]  And we have all the eyewitnesses and testimony that they'd get the mail-in ballots.
[02:07:11.113 --> 02:07:14.356]  And in some cases they were 99% for Joe Biden.
[02:07:14.677 --> 02:07:15.658]  Who believes that?
[02:07:16.491 --> 02:07:19.313]  I said, to be clear, did they say this was hypothetical?
[02:07:19.993 --> 02:07:20.873]  No, we asked that.
[02:07:21.214 --> 02:07:22.194]  We said, how do you know?
[02:07:22.214 --> 02:07:24.115]  They said, well, we can see with the testing.
[02:07:24.515 --> 02:07:25.136]  It's going up.
[02:07:25.496 --> 02:07:26.436]  It's already really bad.
[02:07:27.097 --> 02:07:28.998]  So you have 20 million people dead from the shots.
[02:07:29.098 --> 02:07:30.559]  You have all sorts of illnesses.
[02:07:30.719 --> 02:07:32.019]  It's all going to be blamed on COVID.
[02:07:32.039 --> 02:07:35.201]  The heart attacks, the myocarditis, the blood clots, the strokes.
[02:07:37.062 --> 02:07:38.423]  Because it's all kicking in now.
[02:07:40.063 --> 02:07:41.784]  Some people die in just a few days or a few weeks.
[02:07:41.804 --> 02:07:43.525]  Most people die years later.
[02:07:44.125 --> 02:07:49.827]  So we're going to have major death this winter when the vitamin D goes down, the viruses that are already in them kick up.
[02:07:51.168 --> 02:07:56.410]  You've been implanted with a cocktail, as Dr. Judy Mikovits exposed a few days ago, of hundreds of these viruses.
[02:07:57.211 --> 02:08:07.855]  When your body gets overwhelmed, just like herpes keeps coming back over and over again when you're stressed, it implanted you with herpes, SV40 cancer virus, Lyme's disease.
[02:08:08.215 --> 02:08:09.096]  That's in the shots.
[02:08:10.595 --> 02:08:12.376]  So are we gonna sit here and take this?
[02:08:12.556 --> 02:08:14.077]  Are we gonna sit here and lay out of this?
[02:08:15.198 --> 02:08:23.283]  And let them put the narrative out and use the fear-mongering and then it's the concerts and then it's the grocery stores and then it's the fear and all the same thing.
[02:08:23.303 --> 02:08:25.324]  Are we gonna go through Groundhog Day again?
[02:08:26.465 --> 02:08:28.526]  We'll work hard to expose it, it'll get us ahead of it.
[02:08:29.347 --> 02:08:33.450]  But I got a sneaking suspicion we'll be sitting here very soon going, Alex Jones is right again.
[02:08:34.250 --> 02:08:36.151]  Let's not fail this time, folks!
[02:08:36.391 --> 02:08:37.032]  Please!
[02:08:37.732 --> 02:08:38.333]  Please!
[02:08:41.237 --> 02:08:47.504]  You actually can get more infected and spread it easier and statistically die more often if you have, according to hundreds of studies.
[02:08:48.084 --> 02:08:52.449]  So we're not getting back on this roller coaster again, at least on a large part of us.
[02:08:52.989 --> 02:09:03.680]  And so they were trying to incrementally bring it back in before we noticed and order the hotels and the different hospitality industries to tell their employees to start wearing them.
[02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:06.091]  I opened the phones up on my show.
[02:09:06.552 --> 02:09:11.896]  Hundreds of calls last week of people being told, indeed, our hotel chain says the masks are coming back.
[02:09:12.236 --> 02:09:13.778]  And then boom, it was suddenly in the news.
[02:09:14.839 --> 02:09:18.622]  Some public schools have closed in places like Texas and New York.
[02:09:19.122 --> 02:09:20.964]  Again, hospitals are bringing back the mask.
[02:09:21.664 --> 02:09:23.466]  They're talking about vaccine passports again.
[02:09:23.506 --> 02:09:34.845]   In fact, a bunch of colleges are making you have the shots, including the quote, new one to be in the school, even though it doesn't come out until Get this, of course, September 15th.
[02:09:35.425 --> 02:09:43.110]  So CDC denies COVID restrictions coming after bombshell Alex Jones exposes Biden's lockdown plan.
[02:09:43.950 --> 02:09:44.811]  Here's the AP article.
[02:09:45.071 --> 02:09:51.215]  Conspiracy theorist spreads false information about the return of COVID mandates, even though they are returning in front of our faces.
[02:09:52.075 --> 02:09:54.997]  They have science check COVID-19 vaccination project.
[02:09:55.457 --> 02:09:59.660]  No support for viral claim that COVID-19 lockdowns are returning this fall.
[02:09:59.900 --> 02:10:00.961]  And you know who funds this group?
[02:10:01.657 --> 02:10:07.416]   Bill and Melinda Gates fund the watchdog group. Isn't that a massive conflict of interest?
[02:10:07.416 --> 02:10:12.217]   Here's another one. We'll play a clip of Biden breaking Biden regime to use 1.4 billion of
[02:10:12.217 --> 02:10:17.737]   taxpayer cash to bankroll more COVID vaccines. But he says this time it's gonna work.
[02:10:17.737 --> 02:10:29.496]   Mr. President, can you say anything about the uptick of COVID cases and the new variant?
[02:10:30.325 --> 02:10:41.370]  As a matter of fact, I signed off this morning on a proposal we have to present to the Congress a request for additional funding for a new vaccine.
[02:10:41.690 --> 02:10:42.990]  That is not necessary.
[02:10:43.010 --> 02:10:43.730]  That works.
[02:10:44.411 --> 02:10:54.955]  And tentatively, not decided upon yet, tentatively, it is recommended that, it would likely be recommended that everybody get it, no matter where they got it before.
[02:10:56.001 --> 02:11:04.086]  You gotta love how Biden took time out from being booed when he was in Nevada to walk up to a lady and tell her, don't you worry.
[02:11:05.127 --> 02:11:07.289]  We're going to get you this new shot.
[02:11:07.389 --> 02:11:09.210]  It's going to work and everybody needs it.
[02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:10.371]  And that's what they're now saying.
[02:11:11.211 --> 02:11:13.793]  Oh, Gottlieb and all these board members of Pfizer.
[02:11:14.755 --> 02:11:20.858]  Who are also FDA board members, are on television telling us that, yep, it's a yearly shot.
[02:11:21.179 --> 02:11:24.480]  COVID's never going away and you really need this shot.
[02:11:25.041 --> 02:11:25.841]  Here's another headline.
[02:11:25.901 --> 02:11:27.102]  Is masking coming back?
[02:11:27.522 --> 02:11:30.464]  As new COVID variants emerge, here's what experts say.
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:41.072]  So the truth is, I told the truth about those whistleblowers, and then right after I announced it, they had their program timed to roll out the same day.
[02:11:41.833 --> 02:11:42.714]  Incredible timing.
[02:11:42.734 --> 02:11:52.363]   So that's what supercharged our report, because people could see my report come out in the morning, and five, six hours later, Every major channel in the Western world rolled out.
[02:11:52.664 --> 02:11:54.425]  Oh, we got to make you wear masks.
[02:11:54.625 --> 02:11:56.366]  Oh, hospitals are going to have long lines again.
[02:11:56.746 --> 02:11:57.606]  Oh, there's new variants.
[02:11:57.766 --> 02:11:58.627]  Oh, there's a new shot.
[02:11:59.047 --> 02:12:00.308]  Oh, we got to close these schools.
[02:12:00.548 --> 02:12:01.768]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[02:12:03.109 --> 02:12:04.090]  So here we are again.
[02:12:04.130 --> 02:12:06.771]  But the good news is we're not taking it lying down.
[02:12:06.811 --> 02:12:11.013]  There is a huge backlash ongoing and folks see through these denials.
[02:12:11.574 --> 02:12:17.977]  But the fact that the White House and the CDC and the TSA are coming out and saying that there's no truth to what I said.
[02:12:18.658 --> 02:12:26.542]  Even though you see the robot in front of you shows that they need you to unconsciously, incrementally go back under the controls.
[02:12:27.442 --> 02:12:32.245]  But if you're conscious of it and form opposition up front, they'll never get to where they wanted to go.
[02:12:33.105 --> 02:12:35.687]  So that's the psychological warfare operation.
[02:12:36.027 --> 02:12:44.371]  Once you're aware of what their goal is to take control of your body, to get this UN treaty through, to set up a vaccine passport worldwide, it's going to be assigned to the carbon tax.
[02:12:44.821 --> 02:12:47.864]  The Social Credit Score, which is also run by Bill Gates of the UN.
[02:12:48.644 --> 02:12:52.708]  Once you realize that, you start resisting and they can't get it through.
[02:12:53.208 --> 02:12:58.116]   So any program they launch, they need Minimal resistance and people not conscious of it.
[02:12:58.737 --> 02:13:00.179]  Another great example is the Second Amendment.
[02:13:00.619 --> 02:13:05.684]  When people didn't know the government really wanted their guns to enslave them, they were getting gun control passed.
[02:13:05.704 --> 02:13:06.465]  They could disarm it.
[02:13:07.186 --> 02:13:08.607]  Now the general public knows the truth.
[02:13:08.908 --> 02:13:14.333]  We're gaining back Second Amendment rights, not losing them, despite all their lust to disarm us.
[02:13:14.934 --> 02:13:15.554]  It's the same thing.
[02:13:15.955 --> 02:13:19.838]   Once we realize they want to control our bodies, Want to make us their biomedical slaves?
[02:13:20.298 --> 02:13:20.859]  It's came over.
[02:13:20.919 --> 02:13:29.425]  So I want to salute the viewers, salute the listeners, and just tell them, hey, this is a great example for when they try to roll us about in the future, because you know they're not going to stop.
[02:13:29.445 --> 02:13:42.354]  They're still going to try this rollout, to continue to educate people and bring up the fact that they lied to us about every facet of COVID, and their fact checkers are bought and paid for by the very people that launched the COVID attack on humanity.
[02:13:42.594 --> 02:13:53.119]   And again, the only reason we were successful heading this off at the pass So far, it's because you are informed, you remember what happened, and you've decided to not take it this time.
[02:13:53.539 --> 02:13:59.761]  So I'll see you all on the front lines of the fight at the Forbidden Site, InfoWars.com forward slash show, and Band.Video.
[02:14:00.181 --> 02:14:09.843]  And I ask you to please let everybody else know that the Forbidden Show they're not supposed to hear or see, and all the news they're not supposed to see, is at InfoWars.com and InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:14:10.204 --> 02:14:15.065]  Now here's an example of how we peacefully resist the next phase of this rollout.
[02:14:15.885 --> 02:14:18.649]  This is a shout out to everybody that works a normal job.
[02:14:18.689 --> 02:14:20.833]  You're a cashier, you're a receptionist, or whatever.
[02:14:20.913 --> 02:14:30.588]  Last time COVID came around, we kinda gave you guys a pass for trying to enforce the mask up because we knew it wasn't really coming from you, so we didn't wanna ruin your day.
[02:14:32.620 --> 02:14:38.245]  Unfortunately, we can't do that this time because the government's going to push us around through you.
[02:14:38.905 --> 02:14:40.907]  So we have to push back through you.
[02:14:41.407 --> 02:14:53.337]  Unfortunately, we're not going to allow the need and desire to be cordial and polite to destroy the need for us to do smart things and avoid stupid things like putting something on your face that's not actually effective.
[02:14:53.737 --> 02:14:56.079]  So we I don't want to do this.
[02:14:56.159 --> 02:14:57.060]  No offense at all.
[02:14:57.140 --> 02:15:00.483]  But just so you know, we're not going to let it slide this time.
[02:15:01.003 --> 02:15:01.824]  Sorry about that.
[02:15:02.344 --> 02:15:02.965]  No offense.
[02:15:03.445 --> 02:15:04.485]  Only love for you.
[02:15:05.086 --> 02:15:07.447]  But you're gonna catch these ideological hands.
[02:15:07.668 --> 02:15:13.271]  And what I mean by that is you're gonna learn everything about masks and how stupid what you're asking us to do is.
[02:15:13.691 --> 02:15:17.354]  And we're gonna demand to talk to your higher-ups and they're gonna get educated too.
[02:15:17.654 --> 02:15:19.035]  That's the way it's gonna work this time.
[02:15:19.215 --> 02:15:20.056]  It's gonna be awkward.
[02:15:20.276 --> 02:15:21.296]  It's gonna be real awkward.
[02:15:21.556 --> 02:15:22.717]  But you know what's more awkward?
[02:15:23.097 --> 02:15:25.539]  Doing dumb shit that doesn't work in mass.
[02:15:26.059 --> 02:15:27.060]  That's more awkward.
[02:15:27.660 --> 02:15:27.781]  So...
[02:15:29.021 --> 02:15:31.804]  Sorry, not sorry, not happening.
[02:15:31.824 --> 02:15:35.167]  I hope I don't have to talk to you about it, but I'm gonna.
[02:15:35.548 --> 02:15:37.990]  I'm looking for that 5% that's willing to stand up.
[02:15:38.270 --> 02:15:40.933]  We're rapidly approaching that momentum point.
[02:15:41.353 --> 02:15:44.656]  America has not been sold out by Americans.
[02:15:44.977 --> 02:15:47.239]  America has been sold out by traitors.
[02:15:47.539 --> 02:15:50.322]  And we've sold out America in that we haven't punished traitors.
[02:15:51.022 --> 02:15:53.063]  Biological and chemical attacks are imminent.
[02:15:53.483 --> 02:15:54.524]  They are preparing us.
[02:15:54.564 --> 02:16:06.731]  They are going to create a crisis because they know that they can't deal with a real political backlash and the restructuring and the reforming and getting back to the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[02:16:07.431 --> 02:16:11.233]  And the only government with a history of testing biological weapons is America.
[02:16:11.293 --> 02:16:12.794]  They've done it inside America.
[02:16:13.877 --> 02:16:16.217]  In the 50s and 60s, that's what's declassified.
[02:16:16.558 --> 02:16:19.058]  Biological attack is imminent!
[02:16:19.818 --> 02:16:20.218]  Imminent!
[02:16:20.458 --> 02:16:21.379]  It's going to happen.
[02:16:21.539 --> 02:16:24.999]  It's not a question of will it happen, but when it happens.
[02:16:25.199 --> 02:16:27.520]  Look, I can't deal with it anymore.
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:28.320]  InfoWars.
[02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:30.280]  Tomorrow's News.
[02:16:30.119 --> 02:16:37.119]  Look, I can't deal with it anymore.
[02:16:37.119 --> 02:16:39.520]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news, today.
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:44.860]   We have made the deliberate decision to temporarily enhance police officers' authority for the
[02:16:44.860 --> 02:16:46.519]  duration of the stay-at-home order.
[02:16:47.423 --> 02:17:00.095]  Moving forward, police will have the authority to require any individual who is not in a place of residence to first provide their purpose for not being at home and provide their home address.
[02:17:01.016 --> 02:17:08.143]  Police will also have the authority to stop a vehicle to inquire about an individual's reason for leaving their residence.
[02:17:08.403 --> 02:17:12.527]  Stay home, keep your distance, or now pay the price.
[02:17:13.922 --> 02:17:21.687]  Police with axes and assault rifles raided this venue in Sao Paulo and found about 600 party goers, most without masks.
[02:17:21.867 --> 02:17:25.830]  It was a case of asking people to go home, and if they didn't, arresting them.
[02:17:25.850 --> 02:17:33.995]  Nine police checkpoints have now been set up around the perimeter of Auckland as its 1.6 million residents return to Level 3 lockdown.
[02:17:34.215 --> 02:17:39.579]  This is the video that raised questions about how New York City is enforcing social distancing.
[02:17:39.759 --> 02:17:42.861]  The man was handcuffed in the stands for not wearing a mask.
[02:17:43.181 --> 02:17:48.845]  Disturbing video showing a violent clash between apparent social distancing violators and police in Brooklyn.
[02:17:49.972 --> 02:17:56.955]  And this cell phone video capturing the moment an officer waves a taser and repeatedly strikes a bystander during a social distancing bust.
[02:17:58.895 --> 02:18:00.376]  Get your hands off of me!
[02:18:00.836 --> 02:18:02.097]  You are kidnapping me!
[02:18:01.916 --> 02:18:03.916]  I have done nothing illegal!
[02:18:03.916 --> 02:18:15.916]   Canadians are being hit with penalties now as governments move to reinforce the shutdowns right across the country.
[02:18:15.991 --> 02:18:18.613]  And the city is also taking their mask mandate seriously.
[02:18:18.653 --> 02:18:25.056]  A fire rescue commissioner from the Tampa area was arrested on Duval Street Wednesday night when he and others were spotted without masks.
[02:18:25.136 --> 02:18:26.597]  It's more than just a suggestion.
[02:18:26.617 --> 02:18:33.100]  It is a CDC recommendation that has all become sort of like lock law that you can't really trifle with.
[02:18:33.260 --> 02:18:38.043]  Ladies and gentlemen, this gathering is unfortunately lawful, unlawful.
[02:18:38.943 --> 02:18:41.444]  Under the coronavirus regulations we have currently.
[02:18:41.644 --> 02:18:44.146]  The officer explains that she's being arrested.
[02:18:44.426 --> 02:18:49.748]  When she continues to resist, he uses his taser.
[02:18:50.169 --> 02:18:51.029]  Put your hands right here.
[02:18:51.109 --> 02:18:53.931]  Do I compete to tase?
[02:18:53.971 --> 02:18:54.651]  Yes you are!
[02:18:55.011 --> 02:18:56.272]  I will tase you right now!
[02:18:56.432 --> 02:18:57.412]  What disturbance did I cause?
[02:18:57.432 --> 02:18:57.672]  What date?
[02:18:59.986 --> 02:19:01.307]  March 4th at Longo.
[02:19:01.467 --> 02:19:02.568]  How did I cause a disturbance?
[02:19:02.628 --> 02:19:06.132]  I claimed a mask exemption, and I did my shopping, and I left.
[02:19:06.312 --> 02:19:07.293]  So you cannot arrest me.
[02:19:07.333 --> 02:19:08.394]  I'm not getting out of the car.
[02:19:08.414 --> 02:19:12.677]  They've blocked off the entire fucking street with cop cars.
[02:19:12.958 --> 02:19:14.379]  SUVs, cop cars.
[02:19:14.659 --> 02:19:15.420]  Blocked streets.
[02:19:15.359 --> 02:19:16.359]  Both ends!
[02:19:16.359 --> 02:19:32.359]  [Music]
[02:19:32.359 --> 02:19:33.359]  When castles...

[02:20:33.285 --> 02:20:40.289]  Once towered over vast landscapes and knights championed honor and valor, there came an unforeseen darkness.
[02:20:40.629 --> 02:20:47.653]  Amidst this impending doom stood a knight called Alex Jones, a brave and outspoken herald known as the Truth Sayer.
[02:20:47.853 --> 02:20:49.714]  Sir Alex Jones was not alone.
[02:20:49.954 --> 02:20:55.637]  In his most desperate hour in the battle against evil, a radiant light descended from the heavens.
[02:20:55.977 --> 02:21:00.420]  God, in all his glory and his legion of angels, stood by Alex's side.
[02:21:00.700 --> 02:21:05.521]  The battle raged on, but with every blow, Alex Jones' conviction grew stronger.
[02:21:05.801 --> 02:21:09.482]  With every truth he proclaimed, the demonic forces faltered.
[02:21:10.022 --> 02:21:17.443]  When the enemy was vanquished, Alex Jones swore a solemn oath that should the realm need him again, he would return.
[02:21:18.123 --> 02:21:24.004]  And now it's Alex Jones, leading a full frontal assault on the satanic New World Order.

[02:21:29.384 --> 02:21:50.703]   A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high quality
[02:21:50.703 --> 02:21:51.984]  coffee has not been available.
[02:21:52.363 --> 02:21:56.745]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[02:21:57.185 --> 02:21:59.666]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[02:22:00.227 --> 02:22:09.611]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.

[02:23:11.304 --> 02:23:14.286]  There used to be these great songs, like, that's before my time.
[02:23:15.387 --> 02:23:19.109]  Summertime, summertime, sum, sum, summertime, summertime, summertime.
[02:23:19.629 --> 02:23:21.190]  And now it's one bad rap.
[02:23:21.531 --> 02:23:24.052]  Eh, eh, eh, look at me, look at me.
[02:23:24.352 --> 02:23:26.734]  Eh, eh, eh, look at me, look at me.
[02:23:27.074 --> 02:23:27.955]  Eh, eh, eh.
[02:23:28.475 --> 02:23:31.577]  What, this country's gone down so low, man.
[02:23:32.327 --> 02:23:33.668]  Dancing in the street?
[02:23:33.728 --> 02:23:35.449]  No, no, no dancing in the street!
[02:23:36.069 --> 02:23:38.210]  You only put homeless in the street now!
[02:23:38.590 --> 02:23:40.211]  This is America!
[02:23:41.152 --> 02:23:42.692]  Calm down, Solenti.
[02:23:43.953 --> 02:23:45.914]  Swallow the crap like the rest of us.
[02:23:45.954 --> 02:23:59.201]  You know, if only you would speak more properly, like Obama or the other clowns, more people would listen to you, because more people like to swallow crap coming out of the mouth of crap heads.
[02:24:00.563 --> 02:24:02.903]  Look at this decline in this country.
[02:24:03.864 --> 02:24:04.364]  Look at it!
[02:24:06.264 --> 02:24:07.444]  It breaks my heart.
[02:24:08.104 --> 02:24:09.285]  It breaks my heart.
[02:24:09.745 --> 02:24:12.945]  One time there used to be music and style.
[02:24:13.585 --> 02:24:14.125]  And ha!
[02:24:15.326 --> 02:24:16.646]  Yeah, no more.
[02:24:17.366 --> 02:24:17.526]  Eh!
[02:24:17.906 --> 02:24:18.046]  Eh!
[02:24:18.346 --> 02:24:19.086]  Look at me!
[02:24:19.586 --> 02:24:19.786]  Eh!
[02:24:20.106 --> 02:24:20.266]  Eh!
[02:24:20.487 --> 02:24:21.287]  Look at me!
[02:24:22.607 --> 02:24:23.967]  Dressed like a slob.
[02:24:24.187 --> 02:24:25.887]  Got my hat on backwards.
[02:24:26.128 --> 02:24:26.308]  Eh!
[02:24:27.728 --> 02:24:27.908]  Eh!
[02:24:28.248 --> 02:24:28.328]  Eh!
[02:24:30.580 --> 02:24:42.348]  Yeah, and the slime balls, the little arrogant boys, slime balls and arrogant, mostly boys, who run the record companies.
[02:24:43.208 --> 02:24:47.791]  All they care about is making money and they'll sell any kind of stupidity they want.
[02:24:49.572 --> 02:24:49.933]  Yeah.
[02:24:51.834 --> 02:24:58.298]  Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra.
[02:24:59.039 --> 02:24:59.339]  Yeah.
[02:25:01.988 --> 02:25:03.029]  They're now a joke.
[02:25:03.929 --> 02:25:07.592]  Anyway, going back to A.I.
[02:25:07.612 --> 02:25:14.797]  A.I., the death of music and the beginning of the real death of America began with the Internet Revolution.
[02:25:15.357 --> 02:25:15.777]  That's right.
[02:25:15.797 --> 02:25:18.940]  Hey, we could synthesize the music.
[02:25:19.620 --> 02:25:23.603]  We don't gotta hire no people that play our instrument.
[02:25:23.863 --> 02:25:26.225]  We wanna make more money and this could do it.
[02:25:28.406 --> 02:25:29.267]  That was the beginning.
[02:25:30.367 --> 02:25:30.948]  The beginning.
[02:25:31.710 --> 02:25:32.191]  Of the end.
[02:25:32.211 --> 02:25:34.473]  And it just got worse.
[02:25:36.074 --> 02:25:39.238]  So this whole AI thing coming up.
[02:25:40.459 --> 02:25:44.123]  The markets are going up because a lot of these stocks are going up in AI.
[02:25:44.983 --> 02:25:45.824]  Are they real?
[02:25:46.885 --> 02:25:50.189]  Is AI another dot com bust?
[02:25:52.131 --> 02:25:59.027]   And I was the first one to call the dot-com bust.
[02:25:59.487 --> 02:26:01.588]  Here it is in your Trends Journal.
[02:26:05.529 --> 02:26:06.249]  Fall issue, 1999.
[02:26:07.449 --> 02:26:09.330]  It used to be a quarterly magazine.
[02:26:10.210 --> 02:26:11.330]  Now it's a weekly.
[02:26:11.350 --> 02:26:13.411]  It was eight pages back then.
[02:26:13.871 --> 02:26:16.612]  Now it averages over 160 pages.
[02:26:16.692 --> 02:26:17.192]  No ads.
[02:26:17.592 --> 02:26:18.852]  No one tells us what to do.
[02:26:20.373 --> 02:26:21.153]  Dot-com this.
[02:26:22.358 --> 02:26:36.095]  Dot-com overload will soon short-circuit high expectations for used profits in internet commerce, entertainment, and a wide array of dot-com services.
[02:26:37.156 --> 02:26:49.167]  Following the holiday season, many of today's high-flying internet stocks, the hottest IPOs, newly emerging IPO wannabes, have begun their descent from their overvalued heights.
[02:26:49.767 --> 02:26:53.610]  We warned that the dot-com bust would happen by the second quarter of 2000.
[02:26:55.752 --> 02:26:57.874]  I am the first guy to do it.
[02:26:58.575 --> 02:27:02.118]  I also took out the domain name, The Panic of 08 in November 2007.
[02:27:05.649 --> 02:27:06.909]  I got best-selling books.
[02:27:10.090 --> 02:27:11.330]  Trends 2000.
[02:27:11.550 --> 02:27:12.911]  Know a thing or two about this.
[02:27:13.891 --> 02:27:15.431]  So where's the AI going?
[02:27:16.111 --> 02:27:18.252]  We're going to tell you where it's going when we come back.
[02:27:18.832 --> 02:27:28.574]  But first I want to say how grateful I am and love being on InfoWars where you hear the truth being spoken.
[02:27:29.254 --> 02:27:33.515]  So do what you can to support InfoWars because they're supporting you.
[02:27:34.395 --> 02:27:34.695]  Got it?
[02:27:36.016 --> 02:27:40.298]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show, and I really honor everybody, everything they do.
[02:27:40.358 --> 02:27:42.259]  I go to the, I go to InfoWars every day.
[02:27:42.279 --> 02:27:46.581]  I want to see what, you know, what they're talking about, what articles they're hitting, what major stories.
[02:27:47.481 --> 02:27:50.423]  And they're hitting a lot of on-trend things before anybody else.
[02:27:51.643 --> 02:27:54.424]  You know, again, people, you know, I get these things, you know, that I'm angry.
[02:27:54.644 --> 02:27:55.665]  Yeah, you bet I'm angry.
[02:27:58.426 --> 02:28:04.789]  He who is not angry, when there is just cause for anger, is immoral.
[02:28:05.387 --> 02:28:05.807]  You got it?
[02:28:07.928 --> 02:28:13.589]  He who is not angry, when there is just cause for anger, is immoral.
[02:28:14.770 --> 02:28:15.110]  Why?
[02:28:16.250 --> 02:28:18.311]  Because anger looks to the good of justice.
[02:28:20.031 --> 02:28:28.194]  And if you live amid injustice without anger, you are immoral as well as unjust.
[02:28:29.514 --> 02:28:30.335]  That's by St.
[02:28:30.375 --> 02:28:31.375]  Thomas Aquinas.
[02:28:33.516 --> 02:28:44.545]  But you know, they probably don't want to say this anymore, because he who is not angry, you should say she, her, or he, his, who is not angry.
[02:28:44.825 --> 02:28:46.446]  Let's really be stupid!
[02:28:48.388 --> 02:28:59.881]   So, going on, and why we need to support InfoWars, and of course, if you want The Truth in Trends, you want the Trends Journal.
[02:29:00.281 --> 02:29:06.025]  Grand total of, you know, less than two dollars and change a week when you subscribe to Alex Jones.
[02:29:07.947 --> 02:29:11.809]  The American people don't believe anything until they see it on television.
[02:29:13.191 --> 02:29:16.833]  That was the warmonger Watergate cat, Richard Nixon.
[02:29:17.554 --> 02:29:17.934]  All right?
[02:29:19.015 --> 02:29:26.921]  They swallow the crap coming out of the mouth of prostitutes, media whores who get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and their government whoremasters.
[02:29:28.069 --> 02:29:28.690]  You ready for this?
[02:29:32.914 --> 02:29:42.023]  We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the public believes is false.
[02:29:43.544 --> 02:29:45.806]  Sounds like George, George Goebbels, huh?
[02:29:46.287 --> 02:29:54.940]   Now, Oh, George Goebbels, you mean that guy Sullivan who plays our National Security Advisor, looks like his great, great grandson?
[02:29:55.260 --> 02:29:56.920]  No, not that George Goebbels.
[02:29:57.240 --> 02:29:58.140]  I left the word out.
[02:29:58.480 --> 02:29:59.280]  I'm going to reread it.
[02:30:01.281 --> 02:30:09.243]  We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.
[02:30:10.323 --> 02:30:14.164]  William J. Casey, CIA Director, 1981 under Reagan.
[02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:17.670]  Alright?
[02:30:18.711 --> 02:30:19.171]  Alright?
[02:30:21.833 --> 02:30:22.873]  Disinformation?
[02:30:23.394 --> 02:30:30.678]  No, when you don't believe what they're saying, it's misinformation when you don't swallow Casey crap!
[02:30:34.680 --> 02:30:36.281]  You arrogant boy!
[02:30:36.681 --> 02:30:38.222]  May you rot in hell!
[02:30:41.024 --> 02:30:42.605]  Selling the people lies?!
[02:30:42.625 --> 02:30:46.167]  Yeah!
[02:30:46.886 --> 02:30:47.887]  We're the government!
[02:30:48.808 --> 02:30:50.489]  You do what we tell you!
[02:30:50.509 --> 02:30:54.653]  I'm Arrogant Gavin Newsom!
[02:30:56.595 --> 02:30:59.878]  I'm Daddy's boy, Andy Cuomo!
[02:31:00.719 --> 02:31:02.380]  I'm Witless Whitmer!
[02:31:02.621 --> 02:31:04.923]  I'm the Lion from Ohio!
[02:31:05.884 --> 02:31:07.445]  We'll tell you what to do!
[02:31:07.465 --> 02:31:11.469]  Oh, and Trump's Operation Warp Speed.
[02:31:11.509 --> 02:31:12.770]  Can't forget that one.
[02:31:13.662 --> 02:31:21.106]  Oh, and Biden and Harris saying that, oh, we won't, we wrote this in the Trends Journal going back before the elections in 2020.
[02:31:21.466 --> 02:31:24.907]  They said, no, no, we won't support that vaccination.
[02:31:25.188 --> 02:31:26.228]  It's come out too quick.
[02:31:26.908 --> 02:31:27.228]  Oh yeah.
[02:31:27.729 --> 02:31:30.370]  And then after they got elected, no jab, no job.
[02:31:31.691 --> 02:31:31.911]  Yeah.
[02:31:32.771 --> 02:31:34.952]  These are the clowns we got running our show.
[02:31:35.752 --> 02:31:43.236]  So now I said, I was going to talk about what's going on in AI and it's big.
[02:31:43.618 --> 02:31:44.178]  And it's real.
[02:31:45.399 --> 02:31:51.805]  Yeah, this is an article last week for the Toilet Paper Record in New York Times.
[02:31:51.825 --> 02:31:52.725]  Look how big this is.
[02:31:55.508 --> 02:31:56.729]  Stroke silenced her.
[02:31:56.849 --> 02:31:58.410]  AI is helping her talk.
[02:31:59.090 --> 02:32:01.412]  So is AI the next dot-com bust?
[02:32:06.076 --> 02:32:09.739]  Demand for AI chips lifts NVIDIA's sales to record high.
[02:32:11.220 --> 02:32:13.242]  The sales are to record high.
[02:32:14.654 --> 02:32:15.795]  This is real.
[02:32:17.335 --> 02:32:20.037]  AI, chat, GPT.
[02:32:21.157 --> 02:32:27.040]  Trends are born, they grow, they mature, reach old age, and die.
[02:32:29.001 --> 02:32:30.102]  This has just been born.
[02:32:31.703 --> 02:32:37.926]  I remember when the internet revolution began in 1994, really started taking off.
[02:32:37.946 --> 02:32:43.409]  It was just the beginning.
[02:32:43.979 --> 02:32:47.523]  When the dot-com bust came, they were making up crap.
[02:32:48.183 --> 02:32:49.224]  That made no sense.
[02:32:50.926 --> 02:32:53.168]  And that's when I forecast, no, this thing's gonna go down.
[02:32:54.650 --> 02:33:00.976]  But everybody believed it because they were speaking this new language of another line of BS.
[02:33:04.900 --> 02:33:05.821]  This is different.
[02:33:06.940 --> 02:33:13.226]  This AI, matter of fact, is one of our top trends for 2023.
[02:33:13.846 --> 02:33:15.468]  AI, we own you.
[02:33:17.409 --> 02:33:24.275]  And the people that are going to be losing the jobs, according to the data coming out, are not low-paid workers.
[02:33:26.077 --> 02:33:28.339]  They're middle-class and higher-end paid workers.
[02:33:32.783 --> 02:33:33.964]  So this thing is real.
[02:33:36.457 --> 02:33:38.057]  And it's going to hurt a lot of people.
[02:33:38.057 --> 02:33:57.016]   And, and I tell the youngest people on my staff, learn everything you can about this AI.
[02:33:57.230 --> 02:33:58.350]  Everything you can.
[02:33:59.031 --> 02:34:00.331]  Understand chat.
[02:34:01.092 --> 02:34:04.734]  Understand it to the highest, highest, highest level you can.
[02:34:05.481 --> 02:34:07.203]  This is an on-trend panorama.
[02:34:07.283 --> 02:34:08.044]  Like it, hate it.
[02:34:08.745 --> 02:34:12.590]  When you forecast trends, it's not what you want, what you wish for, what you like.
[02:34:13.211 --> 02:34:13.891]  It's what is.
[02:34:15.974 --> 02:34:19.438]  Again, trends are born, they mature, reach old age and die.
[02:34:20.139 --> 02:34:22.362]  This has just been born.
[02:34:23.058 --> 02:34:30.462]  This is one of the biggest on-trendpreneur opportunities in the coming lifetime.
[02:34:30.822 --> 02:34:43.169]  That's, of course, if the world doesn't come to an end because of the crazy people we got running the show that may start a nuclear war because they're out of their minds and you don't ask crazy people why they're out of their minds.
[02:34:46.351 --> 02:34:47.251]  Name the country.
[02:34:48.732 --> 02:34:49.332]  Yeah, Biden.
[02:34:49.372 --> 02:34:50.573]  Oh, that's a straight cat, man.
[02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:52.940]  Solid as can be, man.
[02:34:54.861 --> 02:34:55.161]  Yeah.
[02:34:55.701 --> 02:34:57.621]  Nuts and Yahoo over there in Israel.
[02:34:58.082 --> 02:34:59.822]  Did away with the judiciary reform.
[02:35:00.162 --> 02:35:01.922]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:35:02.203 --> 02:35:04.623]  Little Katson Macron over there in France.
[02:35:05.683 --> 02:35:08.684]  A little peckerhead of nothing.
[02:35:10.284 --> 02:35:12.305]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:35:13.465 --> 02:35:16.226]  But other than that, stay on the AI.
[02:35:17.535 --> 02:35:20.477]  Learn everything you can about it in every different way.
[02:35:20.938 --> 02:35:23.020]  This, unfortunately, is the future.
[02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:25.081]  I mentioned how they killed music.
[02:35:25.982 --> 02:35:26.522]  It's dead.
[02:35:27.263 --> 02:35:27.503]  Dead.
[02:35:28.244 --> 02:35:34.649]  I hear the same damn beat every time I go into a restaurant, fine place, anything.
[02:35:35.089 --> 02:35:37.731]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:35:38.012 --> 02:35:39.333]  Boy, I never heard that beat before.
[02:35:41.354 --> 02:35:44.537]  One time the cats got dressed up, huh, and playing.
[02:35:46.679 --> 02:35:46.879]  Yeah.
[02:35:48.860 --> 02:35:49.920]  And now it's gone.
[02:35:50.441 --> 02:35:51.361]  One bad wrap.
[02:35:52.601 --> 02:35:54.342]  So this AI is going to take over.
[02:35:54.362 --> 02:36:04.885]  So going into the investment strategies, the markets are not going to, the markets get to have a lousy August, and we're forecasting a worse September.
[02:36:05.645 --> 02:36:13.788]  And the crash may definitely come, I shouldn't say definitely with May, looks very high likely to come in October.
[02:36:14.688 --> 02:36:18.639]   Because you got your treasuries And your money markets.
[02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:20.600]  Yeah.
[02:36:21.180 --> 02:36:26.923]  Why should I gamble in the equity markets and I'm getting over 5% interest on my money?
[02:36:26.943 --> 02:36:31.746]  And I got no risk or hardly any risk.
[02:36:33.847 --> 02:36:34.967]  And we got a great article.
[02:36:36.428 --> 02:36:40.170]  It's coming out this week, a special trend alert by Gregory Manorino.
[02:36:41.351 --> 02:36:45.093]  On what's going on in the banking system and all the money is being drawn out.
[02:36:46.144 --> 02:36:47.965]  And that's only the beginning of it.
[02:36:48.766 --> 02:36:49.827]  Only the beginning of it.
[02:36:50.808 --> 02:36:57.793]  Because there's going to be the office building bust that's going to break down the banks like nothing else we've seen in modern history.
[02:36:59.214 --> 02:37:00.675]  And again, we're going to take a break.
[02:37:02.236 --> 02:37:02.997]  Get it straight.
[02:37:03.657 --> 02:37:05.799]  Do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[02:37:05.819 --> 02:37:07.060]  They got great products.
[02:37:08.101 --> 02:37:10.963]  They help InfoWars and they help you.
[02:37:12.344 --> 02:37:15.146]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:37:15.626 --> 02:37:18.488]  Again, summertime, summertime, sum, sum, summertime.
[02:37:18.828 --> 02:37:24.772]  My favorite one was, school is out at last, and I'm so glad I passed!
[02:37:25.292 --> 02:37:27.394]  Yeah, I hated every day of school.
[02:37:27.634 --> 02:37:27.734]  Ugh.
[02:37:28.314 --> 02:37:28.695]  Anyway.
[02:37:29.595 --> 02:37:31.776]  But again, summertime used to be fun.
[02:37:31.797 --> 02:37:35.894]   And I mentioned this before, I'll mention it again.
[02:37:35.914 --> 02:37:38.735]  This is from Bloomberg, so you can't call it misinformation.
[02:37:39.175 --> 02:37:42.476]  And I find that sexist, calling it misinformation.
[02:37:42.756 --> 02:37:44.197]  Why, that's terrible.
[02:37:45.357 --> 02:37:46.917]  Let's call it gender information.
[02:37:49.078 --> 02:37:56.180]  Gen Z is searching for sad music on Spotify Technology SA more than any other generation.
[02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:02.642]  Leading the streaming platform to dub the past few months as Bummer Summer.
[02:38:04.022 --> 02:38:04.262]  Alright?
[02:38:06.289 --> 02:38:07.410]  Bummer summer.
[02:38:08.510 --> 02:38:09.651]  You know why it's a bummer summer?
[02:38:10.211 --> 02:38:12.413]  Because it's brought to you by the bums.
[02:38:13.033 --> 02:38:21.418]  The lousy, low-life bums that have destroyed this country, sucked the joy out of life.
[02:38:21.798 --> 02:38:24.239]  Hey, all you politicians!
[02:38:25.020 --> 02:38:33.605]  All you little boys and girls that were class presidents and headed a student council in college and kept on going.
[02:38:34.850 --> 02:38:43.892]  Once upon a time, but you're all too stupid and arrogant to know this, it was a thing called the Declaration of Independence.
[02:38:44.953 --> 02:38:50.294]  And it was about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:38:51.414 --> 02:38:52.094]  Happiness?
[02:38:52.555 --> 02:38:53.775]  Why, how dare you?
[02:38:54.175 --> 02:38:55.855]  Lock down your business!
[02:38:56.936 --> 02:38:57.936]  Stay at home!
[02:38:59.614 --> 02:39:08.980]  Your mother's dying, your father's dying, your brother's dying, your friend's dying, you can't go into the hospital or nursing home to go see him!
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:12.582]  I'm in charge!
[02:39:13.683 --> 02:39:15.664]  I'm an American!
[02:39:15.684 --> 02:39:19.886]  A-M-E-R-I-K-A-N!
[02:39:21.728 --> 02:39:22.068]  Yeah.
[02:39:23.449 --> 02:39:23.889]  Look at this.
[02:39:24.941 --> 02:39:26.082]  I'm reading in this article.
[02:39:26.402 --> 02:39:27.162]  Oh, Salenti!
[02:39:27.522 --> 02:39:28.843]  Use proper language!
[02:39:29.343 --> 02:39:31.164]  Suck the crap that we suck!
[02:39:32.105 --> 02:39:34.246]  Be one of the sad people!
[02:39:34.266 --> 02:39:34.346]  Yeah.
[02:39:36.467 --> 02:39:38.328]  It's right there.
[02:39:40.349 --> 02:39:40.829]  Right there.
[02:39:42.290 --> 02:39:46.872]  Sad is Gen Z's most searched term on Spotify.
[02:39:47.473 --> 02:39:52.515]  The audio service said in a blog post last Monday.
[02:39:53.596 --> 02:39:53.716]  Yep.
[02:39:57.005 --> 02:39:57.485]  Ain't that great?
[02:40:00.187 --> 02:40:03.470]  Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:40:04.731 --> 02:40:10.034]  One time, American man, even the blues had an upside to them, you know?
[02:40:10.995 --> 02:40:11.936]  Not anymore.
[02:40:12.316 --> 02:40:14.257]  Again, just one bad rap.
[02:40:14.518 --> 02:40:15.278]  Ay, ay.
[02:40:15.658 --> 02:40:17.240]  Don't know why I'm so sad.
[02:40:17.260 --> 02:40:18.561]  Ay, ay.
[02:40:18.941 --> 02:40:19.661]  Look at me.
[02:40:20.022 --> 02:40:20.782]  Look at me.
[02:40:21.162 --> 02:40:21.923]  Ay, ay.
[02:40:23.384 --> 02:40:23.724]  Yeah.
[02:40:24.425 --> 02:40:24.665]  Yeah.
[02:40:25.726 --> 02:40:25.886]  So.
[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:31.844]  Going back to the economy.
[02:40:33.966 --> 02:40:35.747]  It's very serious what's going on.
[02:40:36.048 --> 02:40:39.531]  We're going to be putting out an article by Gregory Manorino.
[02:40:40.031 --> 02:40:45.597]  Runs on banks are going on right now, but let's keep it quiet.
[02:40:47.538 --> 02:40:52.323]  I mentioned to you before why people aren't one of the reasons they're putting money in the bank.
[02:40:53.237 --> 02:40:59.000]  Why should I when I'm getting, again, almost 5% more put on treasuries or money market funds?
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:01.501]  So this is just from Bloomberg.
[02:41:01.881 --> 02:41:03.222]  Just got it when I took the break.
[02:41:04.362 --> 02:41:10.945]  An auction of two-year treasury notes Monday, today, drew the highest yield since 2006.
[02:41:12.025 --> 02:41:12.586]  Oh, 2006.
[02:41:13.466 --> 02:41:14.266]  The markets crashed in 2008.
[02:41:14.306 --> 02:41:16.007]  That was the lead-up, right?
[02:41:16.087 --> 02:41:16.427]  Oh, yeah.
[02:41:17.688 --> 02:41:18.728]  Reflecting the U.S.
[02:41:18.768 --> 02:41:24.670]   bond market sell-off that deepened last week in anticipation of another Federal Reserve rate increase.
[02:41:24.670 --> 02:41:34.511]  So there you got it.
[02:41:34.741 --> 02:41:39.585]  Two-year yields climbed by nearly 14 basis points last week, including on Friday.
[02:41:40.786 --> 02:41:45.169]  So, people are going to be taking their money out of the stock markets.
[02:41:46.576 --> 02:41:52.478]  It's a safe bet to buy a money market fund or a treasury and you know you're getting income coming in.
[02:41:52.677 --> 02:41:59.557]  You're not gambling.
[02:41:59.557 --> 02:42:04.837]   So when we're looking at this, we're looking at the big picture.
[02:42:04.837 --> 02:42:14.837]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:42:06.002 --> 02:42:08.042]  And again, I'm not bragging.
[02:42:08.723 --> 02:42:22.014]   If you can find me a better magazine than the Trends Journal that gives you in-depth socioeconomic And geopolitical trend forecasts from high-tech to AI to technocracy by Joe Duran.
[02:42:22.315 --> 02:42:27.058]  The top, top, top, top technocracy cat who knows what's going on.
[02:42:27.098 --> 02:42:28.279]  Here's one of his books.
[02:42:28.299 --> 02:42:29.000]  Look how thick it is.
[02:42:30.861 --> 02:42:31.422]  Be Human.
[02:42:31.502 --> 02:42:34.264]  You get this, by the way, on Amazon.
[02:42:34.284 --> 02:42:36.506]  Joe Duran does that with technocracy.
[02:42:36.546 --> 02:42:37.707]  We're giving you everything we can.
[02:42:38.527 --> 02:42:40.409]  And we're giving you the trends before they happen.
[02:42:40.945 --> 02:42:42.285]  And now they're talking about them.
[02:42:42.626 --> 02:42:43.626]  We warned about this.
[02:42:43.686 --> 02:42:45.646]  It's in fact in data.
[02:42:46.347 --> 02:42:46.667]  You ready?
[02:42:46.687 --> 02:42:49.167]  Oh, today.
[02:42:50.448 --> 02:42:54.409]  Eurozone recession seems likely as business activity slows.
[02:42:55.069 --> 02:42:56.870]  Son of a gun would have never known.
[02:42:57.450 --> 02:42:58.790]  Blow me away.
[02:42:58.810 --> 02:43:03.812]  Oh, you mean you kept raising interest rates, had them artificially low for how many years?
[02:43:05.914 --> 02:43:12.096]  You didn't start raising interest rates until July of last year, and the economy can't take it?
[02:43:12.716 --> 02:43:18.177]  And you had this thing called quantitative easing, where you're buying government and corporate bonds?
[02:43:19.557 --> 02:43:21.798]  Oh, you call yourself a democracy?
[02:43:22.658 --> 02:43:24.479]  Run by the central banksters?
[02:43:26.759 --> 02:43:29.640]  How about fascism, the merger of state and corporate powers?
[02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:34.661]  There's a paisano of mine that I'm not too fond of, Benito Mussolini called it.
[02:43:35.518 --> 02:43:36.378]  And that's all it is.
[02:43:38.299 --> 02:43:40.059]  It's this thing's going down big and hot.
[02:43:41.559 --> 02:43:43.380]  Germany facing zero growth.
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:44.580]  Who said that?
[02:43:45.060 --> 02:43:46.000]  Oh Bundesbank.
[02:43:47.061 --> 02:43:47.521]  Oh wow.
[02:43:48.781 --> 02:43:50.742]  Startup funding shrinks in Europe.
[02:43:51.182 --> 02:43:53.342]  Blown me away, would have never known it.
[02:43:54.962 --> 02:43:56.343]  We've been warning about this.
[02:43:57.063 --> 02:44:05.603]   We are headed for the worst socio-economic and geopolitical crisis in modern history.
[02:44:06.164 --> 02:44:08.785]  And hopefully we'll live to see a change.
[02:44:10.005 --> 02:44:14.407]  And I say hopefully because hope is the most negative word in the metaphysical dictionary.
[02:44:15.207 --> 02:44:18.328]  It means wanting to do something without doing anything.
[02:44:19.249 --> 02:44:23.971]  And InfoWars and all the great staff that work so hard, they're doing it.
[02:44:24.891 --> 02:44:26.472]  We're doing it at the Trends Journal.
[02:44:28.058 --> 02:44:31.961]  We're putting out information, trend forecast, you're not going to find anywhere else.
[02:44:32.582 --> 02:44:33.162]  We're doing it.
[02:44:33.662 --> 02:44:34.683]  What are you doing?
[02:44:35.284 --> 02:44:36.445]  What are you doing?
[02:44:38.586 --> 02:44:40.588]  Mentally, socially, and spiritually.
[02:44:41.448 --> 02:44:42.750]  Who are you supporting?
[02:44:45.111 --> 02:44:54.098]  What are you doing to change the course of history that if it doesn't go in a different direction, do a 180 from where we are, boom!
[02:44:55.119 --> 02:44:55.960]  Jack, you're dead.
[02:44:58.507 --> 02:45:03.189]  Yeah, you want these water filters that Alex, that InfoWars is selling?
[02:45:03.589 --> 02:45:05.930]  Or you want to keep drinking the filthy water?
[02:45:07.150 --> 02:45:12.952]  I think at Dump A we got all these PCBs over here in the Hudson River where I am.
[02:45:13.492 --> 02:45:15.053]  Thanks to General Electric.
[02:45:15.513 --> 02:45:16.713]  General Electric here!
[02:45:17.093 --> 02:45:19.494]  I'm a member of the military-industrial complex, sir!
[02:45:20.735 --> 02:45:21.035]  Yeah.
[02:45:22.915 --> 02:45:27.837]  So, we're gonna take a break, be right back, support InfoWars, because they're supporting you.
[02:45:29.088 --> 02:45:31.990]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:45:32.951 --> 02:45:51.004]  And really, it's terrific because there's the one and only Alex Jones and a great team of people there that are giving you, you know, what they feel is the truth of what's going on and providing the facts to support it.
[02:45:52.204 --> 02:45:59.901]   So, they're giving you the facts to support it and what you need to do, if you want to, is to support InfoWars.
[02:46:00.661 --> 02:46:07.123]  And they're doing it as much as they can by giving you breaks on all these great products that not only help you, you help InfoWars.
[02:46:07.183 --> 02:46:08.824]  It's that 360 win, you know?
[02:46:09.584 --> 02:46:13.025]  You're buying these great products that help your health in so many different ways.
[02:46:13.105 --> 02:46:14.885]  All these health products, natural healing.
[02:46:15.185 --> 02:46:17.646]  By the way, that was the first book I worked on.
[02:46:17.706 --> 02:46:18.666]  This was a Warnham book.
[02:46:19.086 --> 02:46:20.046]  Big book back in the day.
[02:46:20.447 --> 02:46:21.147]  Natural healing.
[02:46:21.887 --> 02:46:25.648]  I have an honorary doctorate from the National University of Health Sciences, the work I've done.
[02:46:26.443 --> 02:46:33.369]  And right now they have their bodies and it's the perfect, perfect answer to whole body support.
[02:46:34.630 --> 02:46:36.812]  And you get it now, you get 25% off.
[02:46:37.973 --> 02:46:40.815]  And used as a medical herb for thousands of years.
[02:46:40.875 --> 02:46:44.959]  Turmeric is one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[02:46:44.979 --> 02:46:48.882]  And this has a, it's paired with black pepper.
[02:46:49.456 --> 02:46:51.696]  and embodies its turmeric supplement.
[02:46:51.696 --> 02:46:58.295]   And what it does is it takes advantage of the turmeric with over 95% of its active ingredients.
[02:46:58.295 --> 02:47:02.776]   And again, turmeric contains some of the most powerful antioxidants,
[02:47:02.776 --> 02:47:11.056]   and you need them in this very oxidant, we're gonna die by oxidant, world.
[02:47:11.056 --> 02:47:16.576]   And so they paired it with other powerful ingredients, including five different herbs and extracts,
[02:47:16.576 --> 02:47:22.976]   and it gives you the ultimate boost for you and your family, and you really need to do this in this very poisonous world.
[02:47:23.335 --> 02:47:26.656]  And with these ingredients, bodies, it's again, it's a 360 win.
[02:47:27.857 --> 02:47:44.824]  And that helps you with the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, a whole great, great bunch of ingredients, turmeric, organic spearmint, sage, extract from black pepper, and anyway, a whole bunch of stuff.
[02:47:44.844 --> 02:47:48.466]  So don't wait, because again, these things go out of stock really quick.
[02:47:49.367 --> 02:47:58.770]  And you support your immune system and you also support InfoWars with bodies and it's back.
[02:48:01.090 --> 02:48:05.752]  So where I left off was talking about what in the world is going on with the economy.
[02:48:06.872 --> 02:48:13.574]  And again, I'm not bragging, but I'll put my trend forecasting track record up against anybody in the world.
[02:48:14.554 --> 02:48:20.019]  Show me your books, show me your magazines, show me your trend forecast and we can start to talk.
[02:48:21.240 --> 02:48:29.107]  Go back to 1987, that's how I made my name as a trend forecast when I forecast the 1987 stock market crash.
[02:48:31.609 --> 02:48:37.814]  The Asian currency crisis, the dot-com bust, the panic of 08.
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:41.902]  Again, I took the domain name out in 2007.
[02:48:42.362 --> 02:48:43.083]  I got it wrong.
[02:48:43.123 --> 02:48:45.485]  I thought things would crash again in 2012.
[02:48:47.267 --> 02:48:56.174]  But they didn't teach me about a thing called quantitative easing with zero and negative interest rate policy in Economics 101 in graduate school.
[02:48:57.155 --> 02:49:01.298]  So the Bankster gangsters will make anything up to forge when we pop up the system.
[02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:08.344]  So what I'm saying what's going to happen next is based on the facts and they can pull any kind of dirty game they want.
[02:49:09.136 --> 02:49:13.238]  And again, one of my most concerned one is, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:49:14.138 --> 02:49:16.980]  But I was reading some headlines to show you how bad it is.
[02:49:17.580 --> 02:49:20.541]  And again, it's summertime, and the people don't know what's going on.
[02:49:20.561 --> 02:49:22.062]  They're in a vacation state of mind.
[02:49:22.562 --> 02:49:26.264]  And even when it's not summertime, they're in no detailed state of mind.
[02:49:26.284 --> 02:49:30.586]  They just buy the BS floating out of the TV.
[02:49:30.626 --> 02:49:35.568]  Again, Richard Nixon, the American people don't believe anything until they see it on television.
[02:49:36.997 --> 02:49:39.019]  German business confidence slides.
[02:49:39.059 --> 02:49:40.720]  All right?
[02:49:41.601 --> 02:49:45.984]  Eurozone business downturns increase uncertainty continues.
[02:49:46.004 --> 02:49:46.665]  All right?
[02:49:48.226 --> 02:49:50.328]  And then we go to America.
[02:49:52.389 --> 02:49:53.770]  This was out last Wednesday.
[02:49:54.931 --> 02:50:00.195]  Landlords with $1.2 trillion of debt face rising to fall risks.
[02:50:00.976 --> 02:50:05.900]  I mentioned the article that's coming out from Gregory Manarino about the banks.
[02:50:06.929 --> 02:50:08.009]  This is just the beginning.
[02:50:08.889 --> 02:50:12.110]  The banking crisis that began last March has just begun.
[02:50:13.370 --> 02:50:23.192]  The Silicon Valley Bank, Silicon Convent Bank, First Republic, yeah, those, the three of them, just the beginning.
[02:50:26.012 --> 02:50:28.293]  Offices are the biggest near-term problem.
[02:50:30.533 --> 02:50:34.314]  They go on to state, office values, you ready?
[02:50:35.211 --> 02:50:48.102]  Have tumbled 31% from their peak in the March of 2022 when the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates according to property analysis from Green Street.
[02:50:48.643 --> 02:50:50.204]  Okay.
[02:50:50.224 --> 02:50:51.205]  2022 they had a high?
[02:50:51.926 --> 02:50:53.107]  How stupid can you be?
[02:50:53.427 --> 02:50:55.549]  Guess you never subscribed to the Trends Journal.
[02:50:55.909 --> 02:50:58.011]  We warned about the office building bust.
[02:50:59.255 --> 02:51:02.758]  When they began to lock down, the geeks were the first to do it.
[02:51:02.818 --> 02:51:14.947]  Again, the Silicon Valley bank bust, all the IPOs and the SPACs and all this stuff, they were pumping up because, hey, we're locking down everything.
[02:51:14.987 --> 02:51:16.188]  You've got to work from home.
[02:51:16.228 --> 02:51:17.149]  You've got to live at home.
[02:51:17.209 --> 02:51:18.090]  You can't go out.
[02:51:18.650 --> 02:51:19.771]  You've got to go online.
[02:51:19.851 --> 02:51:21.212]  Our business is going to boom.
[02:51:22.353 --> 02:51:27.377]  We don't need all this office spaces because our business is booming while you're Zooming.
[02:51:29.716 --> 02:51:36.042]  And then people are commuting an hour and a half back and forth to work, and they're staying home week after week, month after month.
[02:51:36.062 --> 02:51:39.144]  They're saying, I'd be getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning to go to work.
[02:51:39.184 --> 02:51:39.925]  I'm not doing this anymore.
[02:51:41.266 --> 02:51:41.967]  I work from home.
[02:51:43.989 --> 02:51:44.949]  And I'm the employer.
[02:51:45.690 --> 02:51:47.572]  And I got 20 stories in a building.
[02:51:48.212 --> 02:51:49.093]  I say, yeah, working home.
[02:51:50.034 --> 02:51:53.397]  I don't have 20 stories in beautiful buildings in Kingston, New York.
[02:51:53.937 --> 02:51:54.538]  Yeah, working home.
[02:51:54.578 --> 02:51:55.539]  I don't need all this space.
[02:51:56.556 --> 02:51:58.357]  You're gonna see not the prices.
[02:51:58.377 --> 02:52:00.779]  They were so stupid.
[02:52:01.319 --> 02:52:06.362]  They were still buying buildings in 2022.
[02:52:07.323 --> 02:52:08.884]  How dumb could you be?
[02:52:08.904 --> 02:52:11.186]  Hey, we're not dumb.
[02:52:12.446 --> 02:52:13.327]  We're gamblers.
[02:52:13.727 --> 02:52:14.928]  And we're members of the gang.
[02:52:16.189 --> 02:52:17.390]  We don't look at the facts.
[02:52:17.689 --> 02:52:19.689]  All we want to do is make money.
[02:52:19.689 --> 02:52:26.968]  Yep.
[02:52:27.389 --> 02:52:27.629]  Ready?
[02:52:27.649 --> 02:52:30.511]  Wall Street Journal.
[02:52:30.631 --> 02:52:33.393]  Again, we're writing about this in March of 2020.
[02:52:33.833 --> 02:52:35.654]  This had happened in your Trends Journal.
[02:52:35.994 --> 02:52:37.435]  TrendsJournal.com.
[02:52:38.235 --> 02:52:40.577]  Office tenants recommit for less room.
[02:52:41.497 --> 02:52:41.677]  Yep.
[02:52:44.659 --> 02:52:45.980]  Shrinking leases sizes.
[02:52:46.861 --> 02:52:54.365]  Or another blow to office owners during one of the industry's worst slumps since World War II.
[02:52:54.925 --> 02:52:57.846]  Oh, World War II, when all the guys are fighting overseas and everything's closed.
[02:52:58.187 --> 02:52:59.047]  You got no business yet.
[02:53:00.968 --> 02:53:09.552]  That slump is hurting cities, wiping out billions of dollars in property values and putting pressure on the banking system.
[02:53:09.852 --> 02:53:11.093]  Oh, that's buried in here.
[02:53:12.474 --> 02:53:12.834]  All right.
[02:53:14.033 --> 02:53:15.234]  But that's how they ended.
[02:53:15.414 --> 02:53:17.075]  Oh, putting pressure on the banking system.
[02:53:17.115 --> 02:53:17.836]  A little pressure?
[02:53:18.316 --> 02:53:20.438]  No, it crashed like you've never seen before.
[02:53:21.398 --> 02:53:25.301]  And it's the medium and small-sized banks that have most of these loans.
[02:53:25.741 --> 02:53:26.902]  So the bigs will get bigger.
[02:53:26.922 --> 02:53:28.423]  Yeah, the Jamie Dimon, man.
[02:53:28.443 --> 02:53:29.784]  Hey, the JPMorgan Chase.
[02:53:29.884 --> 02:53:30.745]  Five felonies.
[02:53:31.145 --> 02:53:32.166]  Hey, we don't go to jail.
[02:53:32.226 --> 02:53:33.167]  Only you go to jail.
[02:53:33.847 --> 02:53:35.308]  Five felonies, they convicted them.
[02:53:36.449 --> 02:53:37.330]  JPMorgan Chase.
[02:53:39.191 --> 02:53:40.212]  The number, you ready for this?
[02:53:41.324 --> 02:53:49.644]   The number of companies requiring workers to be in the office full-time, 39%.
[02:53:49.644 --> 02:53:56.444]  39% of the companies are requiring people to come back full-time.
[02:53:56.652 --> 02:53:59.793]  This is according to Scoop.
[02:54:03.115 --> 02:54:07.477]  In January, it was nearly 50% that were requiring it.
[02:54:07.637 --> 02:54:08.497]  It's gone down 10%.
[02:54:11.468 --> 02:54:11.788]  All right?
[02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:27.278]  Now, what they don't talk about is all the businesses that depended on commuters.
[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:32.262]  Hey, it's great to take the subway in New York.
[02:54:32.922 --> 02:54:34.463]  It's a night in Calcutta.
[02:54:35.664 --> 02:54:37.925]  Oh yeah, remember there was, oh again, Duke Ellington.
[02:54:37.945 --> 02:54:40.187]  Yeah, I know, most people never heard of him.
[02:54:40.802 --> 02:54:41.804]  Take the A train.
[02:54:41.884 --> 02:54:44.408]  Ta-da-da-da-da-da.
[02:54:45.429 --> 02:54:47.352]  Take the A train to Harlem.
[02:54:47.473 --> 02:54:47.693]  Yep.
[02:54:49.856 --> 02:54:50.778]  Now it's a hate train.
[02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:52.420]  Dead train.
[02:54:53.001 --> 02:54:53.602]  We'll be back.
[02:54:54.143 --> 02:54:54.584]  Stay tuned.
[02:54:55.880 --> 02:55:00.463]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show and they have that female vitality.
[02:55:00.483 --> 02:55:03.725]  I got my male vitality.
[02:55:05.687 --> 02:55:11.411]  Take a little bit of that male vitality and I got that vitality going and going in the right place.
[02:55:13.352 --> 02:55:17.895]  You know, we talk about what we're giving you and at such a low price.
[02:55:19.056 --> 02:55:22.578]  It's a lousy cup of coffee a week for a trans journal, like $2.86 a week.
[02:55:24.665 --> 02:55:30.469]  This is the cover of the Wall Street Journal, right?
[02:55:30.509 --> 02:55:32.191]  Look at this.
[02:55:32.211 --> 02:55:32.191]  $5.
[02:55:32.231 --> 02:55:33.011]  $5 a day.
[02:55:33.031 --> 02:55:38.135]  Again, the Trends Journal, $2.86 a week.
[02:55:38.736 --> 02:55:42.118]  And if you get it from InfoWars, even less.
[02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:47.843]  Eight trapped in cable car saved.
[02:55:49.164 --> 02:55:49.444]  Look at this.
[02:55:50.976 --> 02:55:55.697]  What do I care about eight people trapped in a credit card, a cable car that is saved?
[02:55:57.218 --> 02:55:58.378]  I'm paying $5.
[02:55:58.478 --> 02:56:01.319]  I want, I want information that I could use.
[02:56:02.019 --> 02:56:07.541]  This is supposed to be a newspaper about economic and financial data.
[02:56:09.061 --> 02:56:11.322]  And that's the whole back page of this front page.
[02:56:15.043 --> 02:56:15.343]  Nothing.
[02:56:18.675 --> 02:56:21.016]  So going on, I was talking about the office building bust.
[02:56:21.557 --> 02:56:22.197]  You ready for this?
[02:56:24.058 --> 02:56:24.899]  In Philadelphia.
[02:56:26.319 --> 02:56:26.580]  Yeah.
[02:56:29.641 --> 02:56:30.822]  Filthydelphia.
[02:56:30.862 --> 02:56:31.903]  They got it wrong.
[02:56:32.743 --> 02:56:34.024]  They spelt it wrong.
[02:56:34.284 --> 02:56:36.025]  It's not Philadelphia.
[02:56:36.505 --> 02:56:38.286]  It's Filthydelphia.
[02:56:38.306 --> 02:56:43.069]  Yeah, in those areas where all the drugged out cats are all over the place.
[02:56:43.389 --> 02:56:45.971]  Oh, was it like this before they began the COVID war?
[02:56:48.371 --> 02:56:49.972]  No, that wasn't going on before.
[02:56:51.112 --> 02:56:56.474]  There weren't gangs of guys and girls going into Nordstrom and other places, robbing stuff.
[02:56:58.515 --> 02:57:00.316]  That didn't happen before the COVID war.
[02:57:02.677 --> 02:57:03.917]  Anyway, you ready?
[02:57:07.479 --> 02:57:08.039]  Castle.
[02:57:08.759 --> 02:57:10.760]  This is Castle Systems, which I quote often.
[02:57:13.761 --> 02:57:15.622]  Back to work barometer.
[02:57:16.494 --> 02:57:28.322]  Shows Philadelphia's office occupancy rate hovering around 40% and under 40% in some weeks during the summer.
[02:57:32.104 --> 02:57:32.224]  Yep.
[02:57:32.244 --> 02:57:37.188]  Isn't that great?
[02:57:38.688 --> 02:57:43.088]  New York City, 45%.
[02:57:43.088 --> 02:57:49.888]  Dallas and Austin, 50 to 65%.
[02:57:49.888 --> 02:57:50.388]  5%.
[02:57:50.388 --> 02:58:00.387]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:57:53.252 --> 02:57:54.193]  Fortune Magazine.
[02:57:56.674 --> 02:58:07.598]  A real estate billionaire said Friday that Fridays are dead forever for office and remote work guru.
[02:58:09.796 --> 02:58:13.277]  Oh, and remote work guru Nick Bloom says he's right.
[02:58:13.597 --> 02:58:18.559]  Oh, if Nick Bloom says he's right and this guy's saying it, then I must believe it.
[02:58:18.819 --> 02:58:27.222]  We only said this in the Trends Journal back in March of 2020 when they began the lockdowns.
[02:58:29.343 --> 02:58:29.563]  Yep.
[02:58:32.203 --> 02:58:39.962]  Friday has become the day to something with it.
[02:58:39.962 --> 02:58:43.003]  [AUDIO OUT]
[02:58:43.096 --> 02:58:44.117]  I don't know what it is.
[02:58:44.137 --> 02:58:46.298]  They have a hash mark and a WFH.
[02:58:48.060 --> 02:58:53.805]  Bloom tweeted on Friday, adding that it looks like, anyway.
[02:58:55.306 --> 02:59:00.450]  So I'm saying the businesses that have been hurt by this, this is deep.
[02:59:01.371 --> 02:59:02.432]  And that's only one thing.
[02:59:02.452 --> 02:59:04.854]  Yeah, this is a story from the week.
[02:59:06.115 --> 02:59:12.618]  That drudge, which is nothing anymore, put up, don't put up our stuff, or put up the weak.
[02:59:13.718 --> 02:59:23.962]  A whole article, three pages of printout, from bottom to bust, the story of San Francisco.
[02:59:25.203 --> 02:59:35.027]  Not one word in here that the bust was caused by the geeks and the arrogant clown politicians that locked the joint down.
[02:59:36.576 --> 02:59:39.898]  The damage that's been done by the COVID war is incalculable.
[02:59:40.839 --> 02:59:44.481]  And everybody that I talk to calls it a pandemic.
[02:59:45.182 --> 02:59:46.663]  It was not a pandemic.
[02:59:47.242 --> 02:59:54.921]   The World Health Organization, or the World Horror Organization, I forget how they say it right,
[02:59:54.921 --> 03:00:06.761]   called it a pandemic on March 11th, 2020, when 4,219 people died,
[03:00:06.761 --> 03:00:12.202]  allegedly of COVID, in 114 countries.
[03:00:12.202 --> 03:00:22.202]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:00:13.520 --> 03:00:14.220]  Are you kidding me?
[03:00:16.582 --> 03:00:22.146]  Probably 10 times that number died in car accidents in that time.
[03:00:25.548 --> 03:00:26.269]  They made it up.
[03:00:27.889 --> 03:00:29.889]  The data is there.
[03:00:29.889 --> 03:00:43.728]  99.95% of the people are still alive from COVID.
[03:00:43.728 --> 03:00:53.728]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:00:45.886 --> 03:00:48.486]  And now they're selling us the new COVID scare.
[03:00:50.646 --> 03:00:59.888]  As we did in our Trends Journal back on August 8th.
[03:01:01.988 --> 03:01:05.349]  That the media whores, the prostitutes are selling more Theranosteria.
[03:01:07.901 --> 03:01:09.081]  Here it is, COVID Alert.
[03:01:11.102 --> 03:01:12.062]  It's August 8th.
[03:01:13.083 --> 03:01:15.243]  We're on the exact same page as InfoWars.
[03:01:15.903 --> 03:01:18.504]  So go to the Cartoon News Network right now.
[03:01:22.205 --> 03:01:23.185]  Go to the homepage.
[03:01:24.286 --> 03:01:28.107]  COVID-19 has changed and so has our immunity.
[03:01:29.027 --> 03:01:32.188]  Here's how to think about virus risk now.
[03:01:33.628 --> 03:01:35.409]  Who's telling me how to think about it?
[03:01:36.457 --> 03:01:39.079]  That's the propaganda that they push out in the media.
[03:01:40.880 --> 03:01:43.462]  Here's how to think about the virus risk now.
[03:01:44.023 --> 03:01:45.764]  HERE'S HOW TO THINK ABOUT IT!
[03:01:46.785 --> 03:01:49.887]  I'M A LITTLE SLIME BALL TELLING YOU HOW TO THINK ABOUT IT!
[03:01:50.348 --> 03:01:52.169]  You do not think for yourself.
[03:01:52.769 --> 03:01:55.569]  You are not allowed to think for yourself.
[03:01:55.569 --> 03:02:04.069]  Then.
[03:02:04.975 --> 03:02:07.076]  Epoch Times came out with a number of articles.
[03:02:08.356 --> 03:02:10.037]  Secret letter to CDC.
[03:02:10.137 --> 03:02:15.698]  Top epidemiologists suggest agency misrepresented scientific data.
[03:02:16.538 --> 03:02:16.779]  Yep.
[03:02:20.200 --> 03:02:30.923]   Epoch Times documents recently obtained from the National Institute of Health suggested public health officials used inaccurate information And misrepresented medical research.
[03:02:31.003 --> 03:02:34.866]  It misrepresented the damn lying pieces of scum.
[03:02:36.447 --> 03:02:43.852]  Research to advance their policy objective that masks prevent severe COVID-19 and virus transmission.
[03:02:44.252 --> 03:02:53.798]  Despite opposing scientific evidence received from experts, we detailed it in the Trends Journal as it was happening.
[03:02:54.639 --> 03:02:56.020]  The mask thing was a big lie.
[03:02:57.762 --> 03:03:08.805]  Mass study published by NIH suggests N95 code masks may expose wearers to dangerous levels of toxic compounds linked to seizures and cancers.
[03:03:08.845 --> 03:03:09.345]  Who cares?
[03:03:09.385 --> 03:03:10.046]  Wear the mask.
[03:03:13.987 --> 03:03:14.407]  You ready?
[03:03:15.087 --> 03:03:15.407]  March 11th.
[03:03:15.467 --> 03:03:15.767]  Here it is.
[03:03:15.787 --> 03:03:16.228]  114 countries, 4,291 deaths.
[03:03:18.047 --> 03:03:22.127]  114 countries, 4,291 deaths.
[03:03:22.127 --> 03:03:27.547]  And who declares it a crisis?
[03:03:27.547 --> 03:03:37.547]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:03:28.912 --> 03:03:29.492]  A pandemic.
[03:03:30.773 --> 03:03:33.054]  It may be time to break out masks again.
[03:03:33.074 --> 03:03:35.495]  Against COVID.
[03:03:36.375 --> 03:03:37.756]  Some experts say.
[03:03:37.776 --> 03:03:41.938]  This is August 23rd, the Cartoon News Network, CNN.
[03:03:44.918 --> 03:03:49.721]  Some experts say, only the little slime balls that we put on!
[03:03:50.161 --> 03:03:51.502]  We hate you, Solenti!
[03:03:51.862 --> 03:03:53.604]  And let me tell you why we really hate you.
[03:03:53.984 --> 03:03:55.225]  Because you love peace.
[03:03:55.605 --> 03:03:57.306]  And we're just pieces of crap.
[03:03:57.927 --> 03:03:59.028]  We're prostitutes.
[03:03:59.068 --> 03:04:00.529]  We're media whores.
[03:04:00.969 --> 03:04:02.570]  We love to sell war.
[03:04:03.110 --> 03:04:05.712]  We couldn't fight our way out of a paper bag.
[03:04:06.152 --> 03:04:08.654]  We're little low-life boys and girls.
[03:04:09.274 --> 03:04:09.574]  Yeah.
[03:04:10.095 --> 03:04:11.496]  I'm Anderson Cooper.
[03:04:11.796 --> 03:04:14.578]  My mommy was Gloria Vanderbilt.
[03:04:15.178 --> 03:04:19.821]  And when I got hit during the Arab Spring in Egypt, I ran home.
[03:04:20.321 --> 03:04:22.302]  But we sell war.
[03:04:22.783 --> 03:04:25.925]  And we hate you because we're war whores.
[03:04:28.820 --> 03:04:29.060]  Yep.
[03:04:33.626 --> 03:04:33.967]  Putin.
[03:04:34.668 --> 03:04:38.152]  Ukraine crisis caused by Western attempts to preserve hegemony.
[03:04:39.434 --> 03:04:40.255]  This is last week.
[03:04:41.932 --> 03:04:50.354]  We are against any hegemony, the notion of exceptionalism promoted by some nations, and the policy of neocolonialism derived from that claim.
[03:04:50.754 --> 03:04:53.755]  Oh, you mean Obama who used to sell exceptional?
[03:04:54.095 --> 03:04:58.896]  Yeah, exceptional piece of lying crap, the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner.
[03:04:59.796 --> 03:05:08.499]  So anyway, we're going to boogie, and it's time to boogie before the lights go out because tomorrow is hithi, so you gotta have a good time.
[03:05:09.459 --> 03:05:23.382]   We're going to take a See you next week, and remember, do all you can to support InfoWars, because InfoWars is doing everything they can to support you, as we are with the Trends Journal.
[03:05:24.022 --> 03:05:25.584]  TrendsJournal.com.
[03:05:25.804 --> 03:05:28.603]  Read history before it happens.
[03:05:28.603 --> 03:05:37.203]  I've not been this excited ever!
[03:05:37.203 --> 03:05:38.203]  Woo!
[03:05:38.203 --> 03:05:39.203]  Yeah, Mud Club, baby!
[03:05:39.203 --> 03:05:39.203]  Wow!
[03:05:39.203 --> 03:05:40.283]  Oh baby, wow!
[03:05:40.712 --> 03:05:43.336]  The replatforming begins now.
[03:05:43.456 --> 03:05:58.713]   Join Mug Club and get one month free with promo code ALEX at jonescrowder.com Now we're about to play you a clip from a well-known prestigious doctor, Dr. Roger Hodkinson, laying out some of the latest numbers.
[03:05:58.753 --> 03:06:01.015]  These are hard, cold numbers.
[03:06:01.415 --> 03:06:02.156]  See this for yourself.
[03:06:02.456 --> 03:06:15.384]  One of the big pieces of news over the last couple of days has been a substack by a gentleman called Peter Halligan.
[03:06:15.404 --> 03:06:16.925]  Peter Halligan.
[03:06:17.915 --> 03:06:33.428]  He's a most experienced analyst in the financial industry, extremely used to looking at statistics and translating them into a summary statement.
[03:06:34.429 --> 03:06:44.917]  And this is the summary statement, and I hope your leaders are sitting down, holding themselves, because what I'm going to tell you intuitively sounds ridiculous.
[03:06:45.758 --> 03:06:49.424]   That's why it's so Incredibly important that I say this.
[03:06:51.145 --> 03:07:12.057]  These numbers are best estimates at this point in time using government data for the global consequences of the clout shot in terms of death and morbidity, otherwise known as serious adverse events such as heart attack, strokes, pulmonary emboli, etc.
[03:07:14.468 --> 03:07:19.689]  We've been focusing for good reason on North American statistics during the last two and a half years.
[03:07:20.729 --> 03:07:29.911]  But this man has extrapolated that into the total effect, negative effect, of the clock chart.
[03:07:30.031 --> 03:07:32.011]  And these are the numbers.
[03:07:34.872 --> 03:07:35.272]  Deaths.
[03:07:36.012 --> 03:07:37.132]  Global deaths.
[03:07:38.452 --> 03:07:40.853]  Directly attributable to the vaccine.
[03:07:40.873 --> 03:07:42.213]  20 million.
[03:07:43.789 --> 03:07:51.876]  Two zero million deaths due to the plot shot.
[03:07:53.777 --> 03:08:02.144]  And two billion, big B, two billion serious adverse reactions of the type I described.
[03:08:03.905 --> 03:08:06.267]  Now these numbers are beyond staggering.
[03:08:08.729 --> 03:08:24.012]   They, to contrast that with history, Vaccines have typically been pulled from the market when the last one, the birth of the vaccine was pulled with only 35, 3-5 deaths.
[03:08:26.475 --> 03:08:30.940]  I hope people can appreciate the scale of what is going on here.
[03:08:31.701 --> 03:08:33.784]  An unimaginable carnage.
[03:08:34.471 --> 03:08:35.471]  Which isn't over.
[03:08:35.872 --> 03:08:39.033]  Ladies and gentlemen, what you just saw is literally the tip of the iceberg.
