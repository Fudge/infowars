[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.140]   My dad used to say the single worst abuse of all was the abuse
[00:00:15.723 --> 00:00:23.745]  What I really don't like is the puppet president that clearly stole the election, Joe Biden, who couldn't get 50 people to a rally and hid in the basement during the campaign.
[00:00:24.245 --> 00:00:35.168]  Leaks have come out that he plans to tap, quote, an expansive stable of friends and allies to go where he can't, say what he won't, and be what he'll never be, this according to NBC News.
[00:00:35.448 --> 00:00:37.408]  Is this a new version of campaigning for the basement?
[00:00:37.548 --> 00:00:39.669]  The campaign for the basement is the right analogy.
[00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.653]  You had an excuse to do that in 2020 because of COVID.
[00:00:43.673 --> 00:00:48.779]  You can't campaign by search, especially in some of these smaller swing states.
[00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:53.484]  Those are folks who want to see the candidate in person, shake the hands, look him in the eye.
[00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:59.271]  And now he's come out in the last few days and spoken against the Second Amendment.
[00:00:59.804 --> 00:01:03.166]  And above all, we all agree, we are not finished.
[00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:04.847]  We are not finished.
[00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:09.030]  It made it harder for people to buy stabilized braces.
[00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:11.932]  Put a pistol on a brace, it turns into a gun.
[00:01:11.952 --> 00:01:16.855]  Makes it more, you can have a higher caliber weapon, a higher caliber bullet coming out of that gun.
[00:01:17.336 --> 00:01:23.940]  And for those that are not gun owners or don't know basic stuff, a gun brace does not make a higher caliber go out the barrel.
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.003]  You can only shoot the caliber in a gun that the barrel's made for, or it'll blow up on you.
[00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.392]  So it's just made up there, and everything else he says is a lie too.
[00:01:32.412 --> 00:01:43.019]  And in most cities down in Philadelphia and New York, there is, I know well, like up here, you'd see a truck pull up, pull to the curb, and selling weapons.
[00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.823]  Of course, the only time we've seen trucks pull up and hand guns out is Fast and Furious, and Eric Holder in the Obama Justice Department, that got confirmed.
[00:01:49.863 --> 00:01:55.907]  So I guess there are trucks pulling up, handing out guns in Mexico from the ATF so they can get traced back to the U.S.
[00:01:56.267 --> 00:01:57.328]  so they can blame the Second Amendment.
[00:01:58.048 --> 00:02:02.049]  You're saying internally, have we... Internally, have you pulled all that information?
[00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:09.424]  We've looked at 240 custodians, we have processed millions of electronic records, and we've reviewed over 140,000 documents and produced 7,600.
[00:02:09.684 --> 00:02:11.925]  Look, I don't want to hear about the 7,600.
[00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:31.615]  Chairman, I would beg to allow... The lady is out of order, would the lady please... Mr. Chairman, a parliamentary inquiry... Excuse me, Mr. Chairman... In late 2009, ATF agents in Phoenix noticed a flurry of gun purchases in the United States by suspected traffickers from Mexican drug cartels, including giant .50 caliber rifles.
[00:02:33.442 --> 00:02:39.104]  But instead of stopping the weapons, agents say their superiors ordered them to let the guns cross the border.
[00:02:39.345 --> 00:02:40.485]  It's called gun walking.
[00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:45.787]  To see where they ended up and see if they would lead to a major drug cartel leader.
[00:02:46.388 --> 00:02:50.769]  Agents videotaped suspected dealers for Mexican drug cartels buying weapons.
[00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.991]  The case grew to include thousands of weapons.
[00:02:54.671 --> 00:03:02.654]  Then in December 2010, two fast and furious rifles turned up at the murder of a border patrol agent in Arizona, Brian Terry.
[00:03:02.834 --> 00:03:05.415]  But not to be outdone, here he is with the Fetterman.
[00:03:05.455 --> 00:03:06.375]  Fetterman introducing him.
[00:03:06.536 --> 00:03:10.637]  I'm standing next to the president again, next to a collapsed bridge here.
[00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:20.641]  And he is here to commit to work with the governor and the delegation to make sure that we get this fixed quick.
[00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:22.262]  Fast as well too.
[00:03:22.562 --> 00:03:25.244]  This is a president that is committed to infraction.
[00:03:25.664 --> 00:03:28.927]  It's getting so insane that I don't know what to even say at this point.
[00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:40.316]   When this administration took office in January 2021 We were briefed on a number of sensitive efforts by Beijing around the world.
[00:03:41.356 --> 00:03:48.538]  Based on the information we have, the PRC conducted an upgrade of its intelligence collection facilities in Cuba in 2019.
[00:03:48.998 --> 00:03:53.859]  About this base now in Cuba, and you're saying it goes back much farther than 2019.
[00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:55.820]  How long back does this go?
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:04.159]  Well, Secretary of State Blinken and the White House Press Secretary were not incorrect in stating that this goes back to a previous administration.
[00:04:05.575 --> 00:04:11.379]  But it was the Obama administration when this particular signals intelligence base was operative.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.581]  2016 is when this started.
[00:04:16.402 --> 00:04:19.464]  A lot more has been added to it since.
[00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:24.167]  So in 2019, there was more money and more equipment placed in the facility.
[00:04:25.428 --> 00:04:28.330]  This is a deep, ugly story, Justin.
[00:04:29.747 --> 00:04:38.932]  The globalists have done this to put these puppets in, so they get all the blame, while the actual controllers are in the background de-industrializing society, consolidating control.
[00:04:39.332 --> 00:04:48.137]  If we are to be successful, CBDCs could not be fragmented national propositions.
[00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:59.078]   To have transactions more efficient and fairer, we need systems that connect In other words, we need interoperability.
[00:04:59.937 --> 00:05:07.538]   And for this reason at the IMF we are working hard on the concept of a global CBDC platform.
[00:05:28.177 --> 00:05:30.976]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:05:31.042 --> 00:05:35.964]  I want to thank you all for joining us today.
[00:05:35.984 --> 00:05:38.406]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:05:38.426 --> 00:05:41.748]  We're going to be broadcasting live here for the next four hours.
[00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.751]  It is Wednesday, June 21st, 2023.
[00:05:48.051 --> 00:05:55.716]  I am in Florida where I'm going to be co-hosting some events with the great Pastor Rodney Howard Brown.
[00:05:57.386 --> 00:06:02.970]  And then I'll also be on Patrick Ben David's podcast on Saturday and more.
[00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:12.837]  And I will be hosting the full show tomorrow and Friday out of the incredible studios of Pastor Rodney Howard Brown.
[00:06:14.558 --> 00:06:16.820]  He's got all these incredible satellite uplinks.
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.364]  He's on DirecTV, Dish Network, cable television around the country, millions of viewers a day.
[00:06:22.384 --> 00:06:23.945]  We're looking forward to that.
[00:06:23.965 --> 00:06:26.567]  The guy is an absolute gentleman.
[00:06:26.647 --> 00:06:36.435]   I've known him For over 14, 15 years, but I've been a big fan that long as well, but we've hung out some in person before, but I just get a chance to meet his wife and his family.
[00:06:36.455 --> 00:06:38.456]  It's just been incredible.
[00:06:38.836 --> 00:06:42.579]  What amazing people here in the Tampa Bay area.
[00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:47.201]  Been mobbed by listeners just since I got here yesterday afternoon.
[00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:48.102]  Everywhere we've gone.
[00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:53.245]  So it's been, it's been really great to see how people are here on the West coast of Florida.
[00:06:53.265 --> 00:06:53.785]  We got Tucker.
[00:06:54.411 --> 00:07:00.315]  There's an hour and a half south of us as well, obviously, in Boca Grande and so many other patriots here in this area.
[00:07:01.636 --> 00:07:04.678]  There's not many other concentrations like this, quite frankly, in the nation.
[00:07:04.698 --> 00:07:09.161]  I'm very proud of Texas and I love my home state, but it's become California in many areas.
[00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:19.428]  The east coast of Florida is overrun by globalists as well, so no state is safe, no town is safe, nobody's safe, while the scourge of the leftist brain rot continues to expand.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:24.420]  Okay.
[00:07:27.241 --> 00:07:29.041]  Look, I'm sick of the Hunter Biden stuff.
[00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:31.682]  We know the man is there to demoralize us.
[00:07:31.742 --> 00:07:33.842]  He's a total crackhead and a pedophile like his father.
[00:07:34.882 --> 00:07:40.504]  We know that he comes from an empty family that are servants of whoever will pay them off.
[00:07:41.244 --> 00:07:43.484]  Whether it's the globalists, the communist Chinese, they don't care.
[00:07:43.504 --> 00:07:46.925]  And we know that there's two sets of justice.
[00:07:48.065 --> 00:07:51.606]  There's the above the law situation that we have with the Bidens.
[00:07:52.327 --> 00:08:04.229]  And all the rest of the minions of the New World Order, and there's people that are totally innocent, like Owen Troyer, or Steve Bannon, or myself, or Donald Trump, who get persecuted.
[00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:10.031]  But that's because our country has been captured, and our country has spiritual, cultural, and economic cancer.
[00:08:10.511 --> 00:08:16.452]  And admitting that is half the battle towards moving forward and being able to cut out that cancer.
[00:08:17.032 --> 00:08:21.393]  But never before have we seen such elitist privilege.
[00:08:22.677 --> 00:08:27.300]  There's a top trending thing on Twitter about Hunter Biden and white privilege.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.503]  And it shows him there with a crack pipe, or with a cigarette, or there with a bunch of naked little kids.
[00:08:33.083 --> 00:08:33.784]  They're blurred out.
[00:08:34.524 --> 00:08:36.105]  And it says, this is your white privilege.
[00:08:36.966 --> 00:08:39.547]  Well, it's elitist privilege.
[00:08:39.747 --> 00:08:48.012]  If you're in the Democratic Party, and your dad stole the presidency, I don't think it matters what color you are, you control the Justice Department.
[00:08:48.572 --> 00:08:54.573]   The very people that would prosecute you and your son, You put them in charge, you are above the law.
[00:08:54.593 --> 00:08:59.456]  And that's exactly what is going on here right now.
[00:08:59.476 --> 00:09:08.880]  But I remembered this clip from a few years ago during the 2020 campaign when the laptop first came out and the media said it was all fake, none of it was real, of course it was all real.
[00:09:09.921 --> 00:09:21.479]   And when the FBI was running around with the Department of Defense blocking people and surveilling people and Fact-checking people that tried to show the criminal activity that there was those resurfaced videos.
[00:09:21.539 --> 00:09:44.830]   And there's actually hours of Joe Biden in the Senate and him at KKK members' birthday parties and praising Senator Byrd when I stopped it, calling black people animals, calling them super predators like Hillary did, and saying that if black people get caught with cocaine, They would get three to five times the sentence of a white person with cocaine.
[00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:51.134]  And that was because back then crack was 90% something that was being mainly used by black people.
[00:09:51.695 --> 00:09:55.698]  Because the CIA came up with the ingredients of how to do it and dumped it in there in the early 80s.
[00:09:56.058 --> 00:10:04.143]  And so here's the same CIA complex that on record ran me and Arkansas, the Democrat Party, narcotics trafficking operation, with the Bushes who were involved in it.
[00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:06.145]  It's a bipartisan system.
[00:10:07.205 --> 00:10:11.946]  Here he is saying, if you get caught with a tiny piece of crack, you spend five years in jail.
[00:10:12.126 --> 00:10:27.851]  We'll play the clip in a moment, but I've noticed leftists have kind of created this paradox where they're always like, oh, Jones, we thought you were a Republican, but here you are in the nineties bashing the bushes for war and narcotics trafficking.
[00:10:28.351 --> 00:10:29.412]  Oh, you used to be a liberal.
[00:10:30.092 --> 00:10:33.933]  Oh, look, here's videos of Jones in the nineties being against wars, but now he's a Republican.
[00:10:35.245 --> 00:10:37.926]  In fact, I never got to this yesterday, but there's a clip I'm going to play later in the hour.
[00:10:38.666 --> 00:10:51.271]  This is just one of many where they dig up clips of me being anti-war or anti-surveillance or anti-police state or anti-government drug dealing and anti-huge sentences, you know, for just consuming drugs.
[00:10:51.291 --> 00:10:53.371]  I want to punish those that are actually shipping them in.
[00:10:53.391 --> 00:10:56.152]  And they go, look, Jones has changed who he is.
[00:10:56.212 --> 00:10:57.573]  No, I'm against war right now.
[00:10:58.642 --> 00:11:00.924]  And I'm against government shipping and drugs right now.
[00:11:01.065 --> 00:11:06.270]  And I'm against government stealing private property from old people, like the latest that they've showed.
[00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.735]  Oh, here's Jones in 96, showing an old man having his property taken for three inch grass.
[00:11:12.276 --> 00:11:19.683]  But then Jones goes and shows the health department giving him the $5,000 a week fines, and they got three foot grass.
[00:11:20.473 --> 00:11:21.394]  Oh, look, he used to be a liberal.
[00:11:21.494 --> 00:11:23.315]  No, it's the liberals that take people's property.
[00:11:23.595 --> 00:11:25.436]  It's the liberals that ban your gas-powered stoves.
[00:11:25.656 --> 00:11:27.136]  It's the liberals that turn off the pipelines.
[00:11:27.357 --> 00:11:28.937]  It's the liberals that want to euthanize the old people.
[00:11:29.138 --> 00:11:31.018]  It's the liberals that lock us in our houses in lockdowns.
[00:11:31.259 --> 00:11:31.859]  You're not liberals.
[00:11:31.879 --> 00:11:36.381]  You're authoritarian corporate bootleggers who don't care about your own rights and just go along with the system.
[00:11:37.042 --> 00:11:38.782]  And so they're like, oh, look, Jones is over here.
[00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:39.783]  He's anti-drug war.
[00:11:39.823 --> 00:11:40.784]  Well, he used to be a Democrat.
[00:11:42.684 --> 00:11:45.386]  I've always been a freedom-oriented populist.
[00:11:46.169 --> 00:11:47.570]  I don't like the Republican blue bloods.
[00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.973]  Trump was a beachhead against that and an imperfect vessel at that.
[00:11:50.993 --> 00:11:52.014]  We've got big news on him.
[00:11:52.455 --> 00:11:56.919]  Senator Paul has called him out rightfully on defending Fauci.
[00:11:57.459 --> 00:12:06.287]  But how does Paul do that when he got on the early man wagon with Warp Speed and has said that these vaccines work for some people?
[00:12:06.447 --> 00:12:06.948]  No, they don't.
[00:12:07.774 --> 00:12:10.677]  So Paul's only partly walked back, but he's doing better than Trump.
[00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:23.449]  But if he's going to sit up there and go after Trump, which I think is good, then let's take Senator Paul, who I really respect and like, to the woodshed on this because we need him to come out and not just be against getting a function or not just against the Wuhan lab.
[00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:28.124]   Or where it came from, and that they blocked therapeutics and the masks for kids.
[00:12:28.124 --> 00:12:29.004]  That's all great.
[00:12:29.004 --> 00:12:31.323]  What about the shot being a fraud, Paul?
[00:12:31.323 --> 00:12:37.482]   But let's go ahead and go to a short clip of Biden saying, throw people in jail for crack cocaine, mainly black folks.
[00:12:37.482 --> 00:12:41.644]   And then we'll cut to Biden's lawyer for Hunter saying, he's not gonna serve any jail time.
[00:12:41.644 --> 00:12:42.124]  Here it is.
[00:12:42.124 --> 00:12:53.082]   If you have a piece of crack cocaine, no bigger than this quarter that I'm holding in my hand,
[00:12:53.359 --> 00:12:54.620]  One quarter of one dollar.
[00:12:55.501 --> 00:12:59.283]  We passed a law through the leadership of Senator Thurman and myself and others.
[00:12:59.964 --> 00:13:06.848]  A law that says, if you're caught with that, you go to jail for five years.
[00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:09.150]  You get no probation.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.704]  You get nothing other than five years in jail.
[00:13:15.345 --> 00:13:16.726]  Judge doesn't have a choice.
[00:13:17.126 --> 00:13:23.412]  Under our forfeiture statutes, you can, the government can, take everything you own.
[00:13:24.253 --> 00:13:36.304]  Everything from your car to your house, your bank account, not merely what they confiscate in terms of the dollars from the transaction that you just got caught engaging in.
[00:13:36.724 --> 00:13:37.644]  They can take everything.
[00:13:37.884 --> 00:13:40.305]  I don't care why they become a sociopath.
[00:13:40.925 --> 00:13:45.346]  We have an obligation to cordon them off from the rest of society.
[00:13:45.666 --> 00:13:47.007]  They are in jail.
[00:13:48.887 --> 00:13:52.908]  Away from my mother, your husband, our families.
[00:13:53.588 --> 00:13:57.109]  So I don't want to ask what made them do this.
[00:13:57.809 --> 00:14:00.470]  They must be taken off the street.
[00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.251]  Do you have an idea of what the conditions are going to be?
[00:14:03.291 --> 00:14:04.331]  Is he going to be on probation?
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:06.640]  It's up to the court.
[00:14:07.861 --> 00:14:13.705]  My expectation, at least with regard to after that proceeding, is he'll be released without conditions.
[00:14:15.127 --> 00:14:18.369]  But what the ultimate disposition of the case is, is gonna be up to the judge.
[00:14:20.431 --> 00:14:23.313]  But the word is, he will not serve any jail time, he'll be on probation.
[00:14:25.294 --> 00:14:30.738]  Illegally having done smoking crack cocaine, laying around in bed with a bunch of little girls naked.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:37.799]   Liberal, it's trendy, it's like, The UN goes in and just slaughters thousands in the village and takes their property.
[00:14:37.819 --> 00:14:39.339]  New York Times even reports on them.
[00:14:39.359 --> 00:14:39.980]  Well, it's the UN.
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.000]  We just slaughter Africans.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:41.400]  It's liberal.
[00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:48.202]  But if you had an ancestor, maybe 200 years ago, that had a black slave, well, you're guilty and you're going to pay reparations as a white.
[00:14:49.123 --> 00:14:54.244]  But when Biden's saying, those are even the worst clips, calling black men super predators.
[00:14:54.404 --> 00:14:55.365]  You've all seen the clips.
[00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:59.786]  And it just shows everything they claim they're fighting is what they are.
[00:15:00.481 --> 00:15:02.162]  We have no moral authority to lecture any of us.
[00:15:02.202 --> 00:15:02.862]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:03.423]  Please stay with us.
[00:15:04.023 --> 00:15:05.143]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:05.444 --> 00:15:31.501]   So while we're busy watching Hunter Biden be completely above the law and all of the patriot, populist, loyal American individuals being harassed, being sued, being indicted, being falsely imprisoned and being tried in kangaroo courts in D.C., remember that Joe Biden has literally sold us out To the globalists, to the multinational corporations, and to Communist China.
[00:15:32.141 --> 00:15:42.943]  And that his son is on tape in the Hunter Biden laptop, not just these new recordings that the FBI admits they have, saying that he and his father took money from China and that they work for Chinese intelligence.
[00:15:43.963 --> 00:15:46.484]  And I've played those clips many, many times, but you know what?
[00:15:46.964 --> 00:15:55.366]  Guys, find that particular one where he's whining about the head of Chinese intelligence that's his handler, has been disappeared, and that the guy's worth billions of dollars, and, you know, what do I do, daddy?
[00:15:56.104 --> 00:16:00.226]  These are the things that he was sending audio memos to his uncle and his dad about.
[00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:11.229]  So it's just flagrant, but it's just like Swallow's Well and Dianne Feinstein hired Chinese spies to work inside their offices at the highest levels.
[00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:23.594]  In the case of Feinstein, it was her booker, it was her producer, it was her manager that set her itinerary, that created her workflow.
[00:16:24.582 --> 00:16:26.683]  I mean, her traffic cop, her handler.
[00:16:27.424 --> 00:16:36.509]  And so we'll play some of the National Pulse coming up next segment, because they dug through the tens of thousands of pieces of material and found that clip and others.
[00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:38.230]  And this came out three years ago.
[00:16:38.711 --> 00:16:41.472]  And people forget, and they don't even get to the incredible stuff.
[00:16:41.512 --> 00:16:42.693]  There's hundreds of these clips.
[00:16:42.713 --> 00:16:44.194]  I'll just play a few of them coming up.
[00:16:44.214 --> 00:16:49.157]  But here's Blinken, the Secretary of State, gets back from China.
[00:16:50.131 --> 00:16:56.314]  After literally groveling to Xi Jinping and says, we do not believe Taiwan is independent and should not have independence.
[00:16:56.334 --> 00:16:59.055]  Now, US policy has been, it's sovereign and independent.
[00:16:59.075 --> 00:17:00.316]  We will defend them of their attack.
[00:17:01.336 --> 00:17:03.137]  And Biden has said that because he's so senile.
[00:17:03.177 --> 00:17:04.198]  That's the old policy.
[00:17:04.258 --> 00:17:07.139]  He's like, oh, we'll attack if they hit Taiwan.
[00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:08.500]  They have a defense deal with them.
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.681]  They should be sovereign.
[00:17:11.141 --> 00:17:14.283]  Now, the administration said, no, no, no, no.
[00:17:14.323 --> 00:17:15.663]  The old senile guy's wrong.
[00:17:16.344 --> 00:17:18.685]  And publicly said, no.
[00:17:19.941 --> 00:17:23.585]  We are going to let you invade Taiwan.
[00:17:23.945 --> 00:17:25.146]  It is a green light for that.
[00:17:25.206 --> 00:17:26.007]  Incredibly dangerous.
[00:17:26.427 --> 00:17:32.753]  And China's already trying to move into areas in and around the Spratly Islands, in and around all over the South China Sea.
[00:17:33.374 --> 00:17:34.475]  Tens of thousands of square miles.
[00:17:34.495 --> 00:17:36.537]  They're claiming part of Indonesia.
[00:17:37.217 --> 00:17:40.220]  They're claiming parts of islands off the coast of Japan up north.
[00:17:40.541 --> 00:17:41.902]  I mean, this is a power grab.
[00:17:41.922 --> 00:17:42.783]  If I can pull up maps.
[00:17:43.103 --> 00:17:48.674]   Guys, pull up maps of Map of what China claims control of jurisdiction of the South China Sea.
[00:17:48.934 --> 00:17:54.858]  And it's just red all the way past Japan to northern Russia, all the way down past Vietnam.
[00:17:54.938 --> 00:18:02.846]   I mean, this would be like the United States declared jurisdiction of The Caribbean down to Brazil.
[00:18:02.866 --> 00:18:05.468]  I mean, it's just, it's just cuckoo land.
[00:18:05.948 --> 00:18:06.969]  It'd be like the U.S.
[00:18:07.009 --> 00:18:12.794]  declared half the Atlantic Ocean was, you know, a thousand miles out, which is, this is ours.
[00:18:12.834 --> 00:18:16.937]  And by the way, we control the waters of Greenland, Iceland, and Scotland.
[00:18:17.517 --> 00:18:18.958]  You'd be like, what the hell are you talking about?
[00:18:18.978 --> 00:18:20.299]  I mean, that's what China's done.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.142]  They've just declared the entire South China Sea.
[00:18:23.162 --> 00:18:24.803]  I mean, here's China, here's Japan.
[00:18:25.875 --> 00:18:27.076]  And then here's the Philippines.
[00:18:27.156 --> 00:18:27.976]  I mean, look at that.
[00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:29.056]  Good job finding it.
[00:18:29.076 --> 00:18:33.177]  I mean, that's as big as China or bigger, folks.
[00:18:33.718 --> 00:18:36.258]  So, total cuckoo land.
[00:18:36.278 --> 00:18:41.980]  And they say, well, 2,000 years ago, the Qin Dynasty declared the control of the... That's why it's called the China Sea.
[00:18:43.401 --> 00:18:46.682]  Well, the Gulf of Mexico is called the Gulf of Mexico, and Mexico never had a claim to it.
[00:18:47.202 --> 00:18:48.202]  That's what the Spanish named it.
[00:18:49.022 --> 00:18:49.843]  So, no.
[00:18:49.903 --> 00:18:54.564]  Does Mexico get the whole Gulf of Mexico, including... Wait, what if Mexico said, we control the waters of Florida?
[00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.310]  Everyone would laugh at that.
[00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.091]  But nope, this is what's going on.
[00:18:58.151 --> 00:19:00.071]  So that's how cuckoo this is.
[00:19:00.131 --> 00:19:01.572]  Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.
[00:19:01.852 --> 00:19:03.192]  But now, nope.
[00:19:04.252 --> 00:19:08.893]  Now, because they've got Biden by the short hairs, they are really rolling over.
[00:19:08.933 --> 00:19:10.674]  This is humiliation upon humiliation.
[00:19:10.914 --> 00:19:11.334]  While the U.S.
[00:19:11.354 --> 00:19:15.355]  military trains to take on gun owners and veterans and says we're the number one terror threat, it's populist.
[00:19:16.132 --> 00:19:18.273]  I mean, people keep saying, who will they declare martial law?
[00:19:18.654 --> 00:19:20.355]  Oh, we heard from secret agents.
[00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:24.277]  The Feds are preparing for war with us, but it's all secret double-triple.
[00:19:24.758 --> 00:19:25.838]  No, it's official U.S.
[00:19:25.858 --> 00:19:32.342]  government policy from June 2021 that the American people are the enemy, and the government's occupied, and that white people are inherently bad.
[00:19:32.542 --> 00:19:38.426]  They can criticize open borders, or evil, or lockdowns, or forced shots, or anything the globalists did.
[00:19:38.506 --> 00:19:39.487]  It's all official.
[00:19:40.692 --> 00:19:42.233]  And Congress has debates about it.
[00:19:42.273 --> 00:19:43.173]  It's not even there.
[00:19:43.213 --> 00:19:50.876]  But then the Liberty Movement can't believe things are so bad that I was so right decades ago that they're just like, oh, well, it's speculation.
[00:19:50.916 --> 00:19:52.177]  You know, we're not sure yet.
[00:19:52.397 --> 00:19:54.718]  Oh, I talked to a double, triple Q agent.
[00:19:55.118 --> 00:19:55.959]  You told me this.
[00:19:56.039 --> 00:19:58.460]  And it's just always stays in the realm of speculation.
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.441]  And as long as we stay in the realm of speculation.
[00:20:01.541 --> 00:20:03.022]  Oh, Chinese troops are coming in next week.
[00:20:03.562 --> 00:20:04.002]  They don't need to.
[00:20:04.022 --> 00:20:04.762]  We're going under a U.N.
[00:20:04.802 --> 00:20:05.103]  treaty.
[00:20:05.243 --> 00:20:06.663]  Our military works for the U.N.
[00:20:06.683 --> 00:20:06.843]  now.
[00:20:07.163 --> 00:20:08.384]  Go to the Texas border.
[00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:14.775]  The blue and green haired leftists and the NGOs of the UN are in command of the military and the feds.
[00:20:15.336 --> 00:20:15.796]  Publicly.
[00:20:16.437 --> 00:20:17.457]  There's no judiciary.
[00:20:18.819 --> 00:20:20.420]  Garland won't let them prosecute anybody.
[00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:22.082]  It's already gone.
[00:20:22.102 --> 00:20:23.763]  I don't want to demoralize you.
[00:20:23.803 --> 00:20:26.145]  I say that so we recognize how much trouble we're in.
[00:20:26.385 --> 00:20:32.131]  So here is the Secretary of State running up the white flag on not just Taiwan, the entire South China Sea.
[00:20:32.171 --> 00:20:32.491]  Here it is.
[00:20:33.576 --> 00:20:36.478]  I reiterated the long-standing US-1-China policy.
[00:20:37.579 --> 00:20:38.860]  That policy has not changed.
[00:20:39.641 --> 00:20:44.544]  It's guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three joint communiques, the six assurances.
[00:20:45.605 --> 00:20:47.146]  We do not support Taiwan independence.
[00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:51.229]  We remain opposed to any unilateral changes to the status quo by either side.
[00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.873]  We continue to expect the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences.
[00:20:58.555 --> 00:20:59.876]  Well that was a bunch of spin.
[00:20:59.896 --> 00:21:01.137]  That is not business as usual.
[00:21:01.849 --> 00:21:05.150]  That's what the Communist Chinese have wanted them to say for a long time.
[00:21:07.671 --> 00:21:08.912]  So, there we are.
[00:21:08.932 --> 00:21:10.572]  Now, we're going to go to break here in a few minutes.
[00:21:10.972 --> 00:21:12.193]  I really like Roseanne Barb.
[00:21:13.033 --> 00:21:15.034]  She really opened up when she was on the show a few months ago.
[00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:19.275]  And said, look, I've always been a persona of the bad girl.
[00:21:19.935 --> 00:21:21.396]  Because I went through a lot when I was a little girl.
[00:21:21.416 --> 00:21:22.236]  I went through a lot of trauma.
[00:21:22.696 --> 00:21:23.397]  You heard what she said.
[00:21:23.797 --> 00:21:25.037]  But this is the real me.
[00:21:25.057 --> 00:21:27.378]  And she was very serious, very astute, very smart.
[00:21:28.038 --> 00:21:30.059]  And we love having her, you know, be a fellow Texan now.
[00:21:31.032 --> 00:21:34.253]  I don't know how she moved away from Hawaii, though, it's so beautiful, but she lives outside Austin.
[00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:36.934]  And she said, here's her seeing the more serious Roseanne Barr.
[00:21:38.055 --> 00:21:48.079]  And you hear her come out in this next tape we're going to play, it's only five minutes long, and explain that we've had a coup since Kennedy, which is true.
[00:21:48.819 --> 00:21:51.220]  Not, oh, we're going to be magically saved by White Hats and all this.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.281]  She really gets it now.
[00:21:52.661 --> 00:21:56.122]  We have to admit how much trouble we're in, and that's how we're going to turn this around.
[00:21:57.042 --> 00:22:00.764]  We have to admit, though, that we've gone way down the rabbit hole here.
[00:22:02.482 --> 00:22:06.505]  And that's not a negative thing to admit how much trouble you're in.
[00:22:07.725 --> 00:22:10.407]  Oh yeah, there's sealed indictments for all of us, not the criminals.
[00:22:11.348 --> 00:22:13.509]  Oh, there's FEMA camps, not for the globalists, but for us.
[00:22:14.637 --> 00:22:26.502]  Oh, people are getting taken away to be executed through the shots, not the patriots and secret scaffolding set up at the Capitol to hang the New World Order and, oh, Biden will never be inaugurated on the 20th, all this stuff.
[00:22:26.903 --> 00:22:28.263]  The delusion is gone.
[00:22:28.383 --> 00:22:33.626]  All the well-meaning smart patriots that cared and wanted to be optimistic and believed that there was cavalry coming.
[00:22:33.646 --> 00:22:43.854]   No, the cavalry is going to be Roseanne Barr and Ted Nugent and Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan and Alex Jones and Sally, Soccer Mom, and Joe Sixpack.
[00:22:44.094 --> 00:22:45.015]  It's going to be you.
[00:22:46.177 --> 00:22:47.259]  We're always going to change this.
[00:22:47.419 --> 00:22:49.643]  Like V says in Viva Vendetta, look in the mirror.
[00:22:50.163 --> 00:22:51.325]  You are the answer.
[00:22:51.866 --> 00:22:52.908]  You are the resistance.
[00:22:54.597 --> 00:22:56.098]  Tumor Toothpaste is back in stock.
[00:22:56.158 --> 00:22:56.779]  It's amazing.
[00:22:56.879 --> 00:22:57.459]  People love it.
[00:22:57.659 --> 00:22:59.060]  It's concentrated essential oil.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.602]  So good for your gums, so good for your mouth, and it supports your broadcast.
[00:23:01.982 --> 00:23:03.643]  It's back in stock at FortWorthTour.com.
[00:23:03.923 --> 00:23:12.569]  We're selling out of the Tooth Whitening Coral Calcium Toothpaste, and we did get more of it in, but it'll sell out in about a month, of the great Acetate Charcoal Essential Oil Toothpaste as well.
[00:23:12.609 --> 00:23:20.455]   But ending this weekend, and it will end, Folks, it's 50% off on BrainForce Plus and BrainForce Ultra, or 40% off individually.
[00:23:20.975 --> 00:23:24.677]  And yes, we extended the sale on X3, but that's got it in this weekend.

[00:23:26.699 --> 00:23:28.020]  X3, 25% off, infowarestore.com.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:35.545]  Again, thank you for joining us on this live Wednesday, the 21st day of June, 2023 transmission.
[00:23:35.665 --> 00:23:41.429]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going over the big news and breaking developments in our world.
[00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:44.871]  Obviously, a lot of just crazy things going on.
[00:23:45.831 --> 00:23:59.995]  James O'Keefe got a corporate recruiter for BlackRock that is the front of the Rothschild Rockefeller British Empire combine with over a quadrillion under their control, hundreds of trillions in quote actual assets.
[00:24:01.196 --> 00:24:06.297]  And it owns controlling interest in almost every major Fortune 5000 company.
[00:24:06.357 --> 00:24:07.858]  I mean, it is just incredible.
[00:24:08.118 --> 00:24:11.379]  There's almost nothing of any size they don't control.
[00:24:11.399 --> 00:24:19.594]   And of course, Larry Fink, the head of it, has famously said, Uh, that they will control our behavior through the ESGs.
[00:24:19.634 --> 00:24:22.636]  They will control our behavior through the social credit scores.
[00:24:22.916 --> 00:24:24.457]  And here we are.
[00:24:24.477 --> 00:24:26.478]  And then here they are in a video.
[00:24:26.498 --> 00:24:30.120]  We're going to play some of this coming up, uh, start of the next hour.
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:37.724]  And they say right there that war is good and that we control basically every country and every company.
[00:24:37.764 --> 00:24:40.065]  We buy out the politicians and we're taking the planet over.
[00:24:40.606 --> 00:24:42.667]  So you want to join our company to rule the earth.
[00:24:43.689 --> 00:24:45.770]  But I mean, Larry Fink says that at Davos.
[00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.310]  He says, the future's not human.
[00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:48.170]  We're taking over your body.
[00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.811]  And we're going to use money and control to engineer everything.
[00:24:50.831 --> 00:24:51.511]  You can't stop us.
[00:24:51.831 --> 00:24:56.993]  Hunter Biden's going to smoke crack and have sex with children and take money from the Communist Chinese and just tell you to go to hell.
[00:24:57.873 --> 00:24:58.853]  And so I want to explain something.
[00:24:59.714 --> 00:25:01.354]  The politicians want to be blackmailed.
[00:25:01.374 --> 00:25:02.554]  They want to go rape children.
[00:25:02.594 --> 00:25:04.115]  That's just the entry level deal.
[00:25:04.195 --> 00:25:05.955]  OK, smoking crack and having sex with kids.
[00:25:07.016 --> 00:25:08.196]  It gets worse from there on out.
[00:25:09.161 --> 00:25:14.962]  But there it is, O'Keefe Media Group, undercover footage, BlackRock recruiter admits they, quote, run the world and buy out politicians.
[00:25:15.822 --> 00:25:21.963]  But the FBI is not going to do anything about that because they, they all want to get revolving doorjobs at BlackRock affiliated companies.
[00:25:21.983 --> 00:25:24.724]  I mean, they all know they're enthusiastic.
[00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:35.906]  And so people join the FBI now and they join these other agencies and they go, hey, do you want to just stay in basic accounting or, you know, investigating low-level bank robberies?
[00:25:36.984 --> 00:25:41.590]  Uh, or kidnappings, or do you want to make the big bucks and look at the chain and have a corporate revolving door?
[00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:42.971]  And they go, okay, what do I do?
[00:25:43.011 --> 00:25:45.374]  They go, all right, but first we're going to go take drugs and have sex with hookers.
[00:25:46.195 --> 00:25:50.299]  And next we're going to have sex with underage hookers, those 16, we're going to take the photos of you doing it.
[00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:55.505]  And then after that it's having sex with kids, and then after that it's murdering children, and then, you know, that's, I mean, that's your government folks, that's what they do.
[00:25:57.044 --> 00:26:07.730]  So, when you hear about FBI agents getting, you know, busting as the wife calls the police because they're at some gangbang orgy, and the FBI agent's knocking his wife's teeth out, that's a low-level FBI agent.
[00:26:07.931 --> 00:26:09.592]  That's low-level, knock the teeth out, okay?
[00:26:10.132 --> 00:26:16.976]  So, you know, I mean, that's why they put J. Edgar Hoover in, you know, at the first, because he was, you know, a transvestite, naked blackmailing.
[00:26:18.216 --> 00:26:22.439]  So, this has been going on for a long, long, long, long time.
[00:26:23.334 --> 00:26:28.317]  But the corruption has ripened and ripened and ripened and ripened and ripened.
[00:26:28.517 --> 00:26:34.702]  And I got this information from Ted Gunderson, who was a senior FBI agent, back when he said they didn't corrupt things, they thought they were doing good.
[00:26:35.102 --> 00:26:40.826]  And back then it was about 60-40, white hats were 60%, black hats were 40.
[00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:45.629]  But the black hats were mainly at the top, the top third.
[00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:48.851]  Now, folks, it's 90% black hat.
[00:26:49.351 --> 00:26:51.673]  And I mean, we are in trouble.
[00:26:52.919 --> 00:26:57.721]  Every country ends up falling when the internal police, the federal police, the Praetorian Guard go bad.
[00:26:58.402 --> 00:26:58.882]  And we're here.
[00:26:59.702 --> 00:27:07.926]  So here is Roseanne Barr doing an excellent job laying out the fact that we've had a coup over this country and they're using blackmail to control us.
[00:27:08.226 --> 00:27:09.266]  And that's a fact here in this.
[00:27:10.487 --> 00:27:11.808]  I have to be really honest.
[00:27:12.068 --> 00:27:19.191]  It's not, there has never, it's never been allowed to have actual supply and demand.
[00:27:20.882 --> 00:27:24.123]  That's been hijacked by, you know, vampires.
[00:27:24.503 --> 00:27:24.743]  Right.
[00:27:26.364 --> 00:27:27.525]  As has our government.
[00:27:28.225 --> 00:27:30.746]  And, you know, our government was hijacked from the people.
[00:27:30.846 --> 00:27:32.146]  Everybody knows all that.
[00:27:32.967 --> 00:27:40.710]  And do you think that I guess what our government was overthrown with the assassination of President Kennedy?
[00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.570]  Yeah.
[00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:43.972]  Probably even before then.
[00:27:44.332 --> 00:27:50.178]  Well, they were working on it since they got the Federal Reserve in there when everybody was off for Christmas or some sh**.
[00:27:50.739 --> 00:27:51.700]  They always do that.
[00:27:52.581 --> 00:28:04.333]   Because when you look at this FIBI sh** that Obama did with the fake FISAs and totally against the rule of law and everything that the United States Constitution Yeah.
[00:28:04.232 --> 00:28:09.192]   guaranteed to each citizen, even if they're running for president of the United States,
[00:28:09.192 --> 00:28:14.472]   if they're a candidate, to break every one of those laws with the five I's, which are all in
[00:28:14.472 --> 00:28:23.591]   collusion with MI6, Great Britain, Great Britain's Mossad, and you know, Mossad, CIA, MI6,
[00:28:23.591 --> 00:28:28.552]   all of them, they're the same thing. Yeah. They just spy on everybody. And then video.
[00:28:28.552 --> 00:28:32.393]   Make sure that all the people that are blackmailing are staying in line and trying to win
[00:28:32.393 --> 00:28:42.072]   the Emmy. Yeah. In Congress. But we want to let go of all of them.
[00:28:42.306 --> 00:28:43.348]  We're Americans.
[00:28:44.244 --> 00:28:45.124]  America first.
[00:28:45.144 --> 00:28:46.324]  We're Americans.
[00:28:46.604 --> 00:28:52.966]  We don't want none of this shit. We don't want no part in their wars, in their slavery, their systems of debt.
[00:28:53.026 --> 00:28:53.426]  None of it.
[00:28:53.506 --> 00:28:54.766]  It's gone and it's over.
[00:28:55.246 --> 00:28:57.627]  People just don't realize it yet, but it's coming.
[00:28:57.707 --> 00:29:09.089]  What you're saying is that you are declaring our independence as Americans from the globalist, Soros-funded, Epstein child trafficking... MI6.
[00:29:09.109 --> 00:29:09.549]  MI6.
[00:29:10.009 --> 00:29:12.870]  We are declaring... System of debt slavery.
[00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:13.230]  Yeah.
[00:29:14.324 --> 00:29:27.491]  Human trafficking, organ trafficking, Nazis, everything totalitarian, enemies of free speech and sexy old Jewish women speak in their mind.
[00:29:28.711 --> 00:29:34.274]  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation.
[00:29:35.819 --> 00:29:41.521]  Conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all humans are created equal.
[00:29:42.142 --> 00:29:47.204]  That's what this country is founded on, unlike any other country ever before it.
[00:29:47.224 --> 00:29:48.044]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:29:48.804 --> 00:29:59.529]  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.282]  We are met on a great battlefield of that war.
[00:30:04.042 --> 00:30:13.568]  We've come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.
[00:30:14.228 --> 00:30:17.490]  It's altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
[00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:25.314]  But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot concentrate, consecrate.
[00:30:27.516 --> 00:30:29.917]  We cannot hallow this ground.
[00:30:32.202 --> 00:30:37.703]  The brave men living and dead who struggled here, they have consecrated it.
[00:30:38.644 --> 00:30:42.625]  Far above our poor power to add or to detract.
[00:30:43.585 --> 00:30:51.547]  The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.
[00:30:51.567 --> 00:31:06.481]   It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus so Have thus far so nobly advanced.
[00:31:07.401 --> 00:31:12.403]  It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us.
[00:31:13.143 --> 00:31:24.627]  That from these honored dead, we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.
[00:31:25.598 --> 00:31:44.008]  That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
[00:31:45.109 --> 00:31:47.110]  Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:47.990]  Amen.
[00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.271]  How apropos is that?
[00:31:50.371 --> 00:31:50.692]  Yes.
[00:31:52.072 --> 00:31:53.153]  We are in that war.
[00:31:54.187 --> 00:31:57.768]  So you have a kind of a message of hope.
[00:31:59.009 --> 00:32:00.649]  You feel good about the future of America.
[00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:03.750]  You just feel like we need to, oh, let me get you wiping your tears.
[00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:04.551]  That's good drama.
[00:32:06.932 --> 00:32:08.512]  I read Roseanne Barwer, beautiful person.
[00:32:08.552 --> 00:32:10.393]  And again, she was always funny, always great.
[00:32:10.433 --> 00:32:11.273]  But she said it on my show.
[00:32:11.293 --> 00:32:12.314]  She said, I'm coming out here.
[00:32:12.854 --> 00:32:13.714]  This is the real me.
[00:32:13.934 --> 00:32:14.674]  And I'm going to show you.
[00:32:14.694 --> 00:32:17.375]  I'm going to lower my defenses as a little scared girl.
[00:32:19.516 --> 00:32:21.717]  And all the things she went through, and I'm going to be who I really am.
[00:32:23.564 --> 00:32:24.685]  She has to hang out with her quite a bit.
[00:32:25.245 --> 00:32:27.086]  And her son, they're just great people.
[00:32:27.906 --> 00:32:30.948]  And she is optimistic, so am I, because we're learning how much trouble we're in.
[00:32:31.729 --> 00:32:33.450]  And then as we go through that process, we turn this around.
[00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:38.072]  But folks, if you don't realize how evil the new rule order is, because you're not a bad person.
[00:32:38.432 --> 00:32:40.253]  We're all sinners, but you don't want to hurt kids.
[00:32:40.273 --> 00:32:41.194]  You don't want to rob people.
[00:32:42.335 --> 00:32:43.976]  You like opening doors for little old ladies.
[00:32:44.076 --> 00:32:45.456]  You like living in a free country.
[00:32:45.476 --> 00:32:46.597]  You like being a nice guy.
[00:32:47.277 --> 00:32:48.178]  They're not like that, folks.
[00:32:48.398 --> 00:32:51.640]  And I understand it's hard for a lot of you to come to grips with that.
[00:32:52.432 --> 00:32:55.293]  It's hard for me to come to grips with it, but they're worse than we can imagine.
[00:32:56.093 --> 00:33:02.795]  You have to really understand that if you're not an evil person, you just have a blind spot, and so do I. We'll be right back.
[00:33:03.796 --> 00:33:07.157]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, final segment of this hour coming up.
[00:33:07.397 --> 00:33:15.139]  Next hour, I'm going to get into BlackRock and the huge developments with this new Project Veritas coup and so much more.
[00:33:16.079 --> 00:33:21.001]  But right now, I want to talk about President Trump, Senator Rand Paul, Ron DeSantis, and the rest of them.
[00:33:22.614 --> 00:33:38.062]  There was incredible political weight three plus years ago with China shut down, all the fear mongering and the reports of massive death because they were sending people with the flu or pneumonia back home to die all over the world under UN corporate directives through the hospitals.
[00:33:38.982 --> 00:33:41.423]  And they had people up there just fear mongering.
[00:33:42.103 --> 00:33:45.125]  And Trump was trying to get every therapeutic out he could.
[00:33:45.145 --> 00:33:47.066]  He was pushing hydroxychloroquine.
[00:33:48.915 --> 00:33:49.696]  You know, vitamin D3.
[00:33:49.756 --> 00:33:51.998]  He was pushing everything.
[00:33:52.038 --> 00:33:58.042]  You know, later he was pushing the so-called horse pace that really wasn't the horse pace.
[00:33:58.142 --> 00:34:03.406]  Ivermectin, the miracle Nobel Prize winning Japanese drug, has even been proven to be anti-cancer.
[00:34:03.446 --> 00:34:06.049]  It stops fast replicating things, period.
[00:34:06.369 --> 00:34:14.675]  Whether it be microscopic worms, or whether it be syphilis, or whether it be Lyme's disease, or whether it be cancer, or whether it be viruses.
[00:34:14.735 --> 00:34:15.836]  I mean, it's just, it's incredible.
[00:34:17.998 --> 00:34:20.198]  So people ask, well, why are you not too mad at Trump?
[00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:24.539]  I saw Trump as the optimist, green-lighting everything.
[00:34:24.579 --> 00:34:37.982]  And I knew Fauci and them from past C-SPAN programs I'd watched with them and articles they wrote and things, for decades were wanting to get rid of the old FDA system and be able just to bring drugs they wanted and vaccines they wanted right onto the market in an emergency.
[00:34:38.662 --> 00:34:42.523]  And two years before the COVID release, Fauci was on C-SPAN in 2017.
[00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:47.751]  And he said, you know, we played a lot of times here.
[00:34:47.791 --> 00:34:54.875]  He said, we're going to blow up the old system with probably a virus, a bird flu out of China, and we're going to go right to giving you shots.
[00:34:54.995 --> 00:34:58.977]  So then they come out and say, oh, it's going to take two to five years to get a vaccine.
[00:34:59.017 --> 00:35:00.518]  Everything's got to stay locked down until then.
[00:35:01.319 --> 00:35:02.659]  Well, Trump's not an epidemiologist.
[00:35:02.699 --> 00:35:03.500]  He's not a virologist.
[00:35:04.272 --> 00:35:05.152]  He's not a pathologist.
[00:35:05.192 --> 00:35:06.453]  He just goes, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:35:06.473 --> 00:35:08.273]  We should be able to get a vaccine.
[00:35:08.293 --> 00:35:12.635]  Because they'd already told him, well, sir, we've got one we already made, but it's experimental, but we think it's safe.
[00:35:12.655 --> 00:35:13.955]  He's like, well, that's my plan.
[00:35:14.235 --> 00:35:15.095]  I'm going to save everyone.
[00:35:15.515 --> 00:35:18.436]  Because, you know, he thinks vaccines, he's a big medical guy.
[00:35:18.476 --> 00:35:19.297]  He's a germaphobe.
[00:35:19.757 --> 00:35:20.637]  He's got some blind spots.
[00:35:21.557 --> 00:35:27.399]  But until his son got sick with shots, I mean, Barron, he was always taking all the shots.
[00:35:27.439 --> 00:35:31.620]  Trump is the type of guy that washes his hands like 50 times a day until they were bleeding.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:39.252]   He had to get like psychological I mean, Roger Stone was his wingman for 20 years at least.
[00:35:39.493 --> 00:35:40.714]  So, Trump is a very fastidious person.
[00:35:40.534 --> 00:35:44.074]   ridiculous to say he was being peed on by Russian prostitutes and the thing.
[00:35:44.074 --> 00:35:45.434]  That's the opposite of what Trump's into.
[00:35:45.434 --> 00:35:48.153]  I know folks that know Trump's sexual proclivity very well.
[00:35:48.153 --> 00:35:48.873]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:35:48.873 --> 00:35:52.193]  I mean, Roger Stone was his wingman for 20 years at least.
[00:35:52.193 --> 00:35:55.514]  So Trump is a very fastidious person.
[00:35:55.514 --> 00:35:56.114]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:35:56.114 --> 00:36:01.233]   And so I knew all that was a lie, but then I knew that Trump had gone along
[00:36:01.233 --> 00:36:03.634]   with him and he'd be the hero because he was greenlighting everything.
[00:36:03.715 --> 00:36:05.336]  He said, anything experimental, do it, do it.
[00:36:06.536 --> 00:36:08.036]  They knew what they were doing and set him up.
[00:36:08.096 --> 00:36:13.038]  And I said, two plus years ago, three years ago, I said, they're going to set Trump up with this and he's being pigheaded.
[00:36:13.898 --> 00:36:20.460]  And now you see DeSantis come out against him, the Democrats come out against him as if we don't know that they themselves were quarterbacking it.
[00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:43.947]  And we've now seen Senator Paul come out against Trump, because now all the knives are out for Trump, and all his former cabinet are coming out, and, you know, Bill Barr, you've got Bob Barr, excuse me, not Bill Barr, can't even crack up with them all, and Pompeo, they're all coming out against Trump right now.
[00:36:43.967 --> 00:36:44.867]  It's very fashionable.
[00:36:45.608 --> 00:36:47.910]  And so I've kind of held off on Paul.
[00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:50.872]  I've talked some about Senator Paul from Kentucky, who I helped get elected.
[00:36:53.013 --> 00:36:58.996]  And he sits up there and pushes the shot as if it did good for somebody and as if it did protect some people.
[00:36:59.297 --> 00:37:00.998]  That's a lie in all the studies now.
[00:37:01.038 --> 00:37:01.518]  It's not true.
[00:37:02.729 --> 00:37:10.673]  And he'll criticize blocking therapeutics, he'll criticize the lockdowns, the mask, he'll criticize where it came from and gain of function, which is great.
[00:37:10.753 --> 00:37:11.193]  I love that.
[00:37:11.633 --> 00:37:15.134]  But at least come out and admit now the shot never had efficacy.
[00:37:15.154 --> 00:37:16.195]  It was always a lie.
[00:37:16.475 --> 00:37:17.355]  They knew it was a lie.
[00:37:17.876 --> 00:37:19.636]  And then don't get cheap shots in on Trump.
[00:37:20.057 --> 00:37:21.097]  I can criticize Trump.
[00:37:21.577 --> 00:37:22.838]  My audience can criticize Trump.
[00:37:23.038 --> 00:37:25.539]  We told him day one we thought it was a really bad idea and we're right.
[00:37:26.115 --> 00:37:30.297]  But Paul, who went along with the shot and told Trump warp speed was a good idea.
[00:37:30.557 --> 00:37:35.319]  In fact, Paul admits that Trump said, well, I talked to Senator Paul, he's a doctor, and I trust him.
[00:37:35.359 --> 00:37:36.719]  And he told me, go ahead and do it.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:47.904]  So you've got the guy who believed it and didn't believe they put a deadly shot out and didn't read the actual stuff about mRNA, who still won't admit he's wrong, just like Trump.
[00:37:48.404 --> 00:37:59.998]   So let me tell you, if denial and sticking your head in the sand and being pigheaded is a virtue, which I don't think it is most cases, But it's good to be bullheaded against the globalists because they can't tell Trump what to do.
[00:38:00.058 --> 00:38:02.380]  But it's also bad when we educate him, he won't listen.
[00:38:02.701 --> 00:38:09.468]  But if you judge things according to that, then we ought to have Senator Paul run as his vice president because they're both pig-headed as hell.
[00:38:10.209 --> 00:38:19.118]  And Senator Paul helped get Warp Speed done, and now he wants to dunk on Trump for defending Fauci and protecting Fauci and not firing Fauci.
[00:38:20.063 --> 00:38:31.712]  So yes, I would say Trump is more guilty than Senator Paul for being part of the nightmare, biomedical, Tuskegee experiment, 10.0, medical tyranny, New World Order nightmare system.
[00:38:32.333 --> 00:38:33.013]  I'll give you that.
[00:38:34.315 --> 00:38:38.618]  I'd say Trump's a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10.
[00:38:38.958 --> 00:38:40.079]  Fauci's a 10.
[00:38:40.339 --> 00:38:41.260]  Bill Gates is an 11.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.241]  Oswald's a 10.
[00:38:42.421 --> 00:38:42.721]  Okay?
[00:38:43.362 --> 00:38:48.426]  You know, it's a scale to 10, but Bill Gates goes even above it, along with the top globalists.
[00:38:49.051 --> 00:38:52.572]  Yeah, I'd say Trump's a three in culpability.
[00:38:55.352 --> 00:38:57.473]  And then I'd say Rand Paul's a 2.5.
[00:38:58.573 --> 00:39:00.213]  But just don't sit there on your hours.
[00:39:00.654 --> 00:39:01.954]  Seriously, I try to be a team player.
[00:39:01.974 --> 00:39:03.474]  I try to be nice to people that are better than others.
[00:39:03.854 --> 00:39:07.655]  I try to play patty cake with some of the more libertarian Republicans, but I'm done.
[00:39:08.415 --> 00:39:12.076]  Because we've been more accurate than Paul, more accurate than Trump, more accurate than everybody.
[00:39:12.836 --> 00:39:17.300]  And when the going gets rough, and when it gets down to brass tacks, where's Senator Paul?
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.901]  On how I've been censored?
[00:39:19.081 --> 00:39:19.421]  Nowhere.
[00:39:19.481 --> 00:39:19.802]  Crickets.
[00:39:20.822 --> 00:39:21.483]  Where's his dad?
[00:39:21.763 --> 00:39:22.103]  Crickets.
[00:39:23.665 --> 00:39:27.348]  I mean, Ted Cruz has said more, defending my free speech, than the Pauls have.
[00:39:28.248 --> 00:39:32.872]  So, that's all I'm saying is, Ron Paul and his son need to answer.
[00:39:32.892 --> 00:39:35.074]  Because Ron Paul knows what's going on.
[00:39:35.274 --> 00:39:35.734]  Where is he?
[00:39:35.914 --> 00:39:36.775]  Where is he on his son?
[00:39:37.376 --> 00:39:43.424]   So, since we're going to pass guilt here, since we're going to pass judgment here, I never pushed a shot that killed a bunch of people.
[00:39:43.684 --> 00:39:46.565]  I never pushed a shot that erases your immune system, and Senator Paul did.
[00:39:46.585 --> 00:39:48.266]  Do you want to sit on your high horses?
[00:39:48.326 --> 00:39:49.746]  I question mass shootings, Ron Paul.
[00:39:50.106 --> 00:39:51.807]  You guys want to sit on your high horses all day long?
[00:39:52.307 --> 00:40:01.330]  Okay, well then, you answer for how you pushed the poison shot, and then don't run your mouths about Trump, who they're trying to put in prison until you've cleaned up your own house like Jesus said.
[00:40:01.591 --> 00:40:02.671]  You want to get the speck out of my eye?
[00:40:02.691 --> 00:40:03.831]  I'll get the beam out of yours.
[00:40:04.372 --> 00:40:06.712]  And look, I'm not angry at Paul, okay?
[00:40:06.993 --> 00:40:10.614]  He's doing a great job on the gain of function and so many other things, but that's what pisses me off more.
[00:40:11.132 --> 00:40:17.194]  Because if I care about somebody and know they're smart, and really respect them, and they're doing bad stuff, I take it real personal because it means they know what they're doing.
[00:40:17.634 --> 00:40:21.656]  So don't think, Paul, Senator Paul, that we don't know, buddy.
[00:40:21.676 --> 00:40:23.536]  I know they tried to shoot you.
[00:40:23.556 --> 00:40:25.917]  I know they broke your ribs, punctured your lung, attacked you.
[00:40:25.937 --> 00:40:26.517]  You're a great guy.
[00:40:26.778 --> 00:40:27.378]  The left hates you.
[00:40:27.778 --> 00:40:29.418]  I'm just saying, no more lukewarm, bubba.
[00:40:29.859 --> 00:40:30.199]  No more.
[00:40:30.519 --> 00:40:31.679]  So here he is taking Bush.
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.300]  Bush, I don't know, Freud has slipped.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.621]  It's actually Bush backing DeSantis.
[00:40:37.701 --> 00:40:39.002]  I was about to give DeSantis a minute.
[00:40:39.022 --> 00:40:39.382]  The Bushes.
[00:40:40.208 --> 00:40:45.131]  The point is, here is Paul taking Trump to the woodshed.
[00:40:45.151 --> 00:40:45.451]  Here it is.
[00:40:46.652 --> 00:40:49.313]  He should not be so proud of keeping Fauci around.
[00:40:49.353 --> 00:40:51.114]  Fauci was a menace to the truth.
[00:40:51.495 --> 00:40:54.036]  Talk about a fount of misinformation.
[00:40:54.116 --> 00:40:55.217]  It's Anthony Fauci.
[00:40:55.577 --> 00:41:00.019]  More misinformation came out of the government than any other source, so he should have fired him.
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.241]  And the president responded to that question.
[00:41:02.281 --> 00:41:02.541]  Listen.
[00:41:04.102 --> 00:41:05.923]  Ron DeSantis loved Fauci.
[00:41:06.003 --> 00:41:07.443]  Sure, but you didn't fire him.
[00:41:07.503 --> 00:41:08.564]  You listened to him.
[00:41:08.584 --> 00:41:11.405]  He's a civil service where you're not actually allowed to fire him.
[00:41:11.425 --> 00:41:13.266]  But I wouldn't let that usually get in my way.
[00:41:13.326 --> 00:41:14.286]  You know, it's one of those things.
[00:41:14.687 --> 00:41:17.008]  But I never spent a lot of time with Fauci.
[00:41:17.728 --> 00:41:18.668]  Who did is Biden.
[00:41:19.128 --> 00:41:22.390]  Fauci became very powerful under Biden.
[00:41:23.166 --> 00:41:26.047]  Is Fauci going to play a big role in the Republican primary?
[00:41:26.847 --> 00:41:28.787]  It may, because Fauci did stick around.
[00:41:28.827 --> 00:41:35.549]  There may be civil service rules about actually firing him, but there's no reason he had to head up the pandemic committee, the COVID committee.
[00:41:35.969 --> 00:41:37.089]  So he was on the committee.
[00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:41.490]  In fact, if not the lead, he was the committee with the vice president.
[00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:42.970]  They met all of the time.
[00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.571]  And if you talk to Robert Redfield, he was pushed out.
[00:41:45.971 --> 00:41:55.395]  He was the one sane voice on the committee, and he was pushed out by Deborah Birx and pushed out by Anthony Fauci, and they spread the misinformation that immunity didn't work.
[00:41:55.835 --> 00:42:13.202]  The one thing that could have saved thousands of lives before the vaccine was that the nurses and the assistants and the people taking care of people in the nursing home, we should have put people in those positions who had already been infected and recovered, knowing that naturally acquired immunity would then protect those senior citizens from getting infected.
[00:42:13.642 --> 00:42:14.983]  So yeah, Paul's right.
[00:42:15.023 --> 00:42:18.025]  We shouldn't be made to take a shot when national immunity is 100 times better.
[00:42:18.665 --> 00:42:19.766]  But 100 times better than what?
[00:42:20.126 --> 00:42:21.487]  It doesn't protect you.
[00:42:22.788 --> 00:42:23.449]  It's a lie.
[00:42:24.789 --> 00:42:25.470]  And that's come out.
[00:42:28.052 --> 00:42:32.054]  So we said something to help people more than the vaccine.
[00:42:32.654 --> 00:42:34.155]  The vaccine isn't a vaccine.
[00:42:34.816 --> 00:42:36.017]  Its ingredients were secret.
[00:42:36.677 --> 00:42:37.898]  It's caused all this carnage.
[00:42:38.538 --> 00:42:39.479]  It's a medical tyranny.
[00:42:40.126 --> 00:42:47.031]  And so, Paul wants us all to forget about what he did, and I just want to get him fully on the team against the system.
[00:42:48.672 --> 00:42:50.453]  But, whatever, he's playing it smart.
[00:42:51.674 --> 00:42:53.875]  That's what he thinks is going to get in my head.
[00:42:53.915 --> 00:42:59.619]  They've got new Hippocratic oaths at major universities like Columbia that you will be woke, and you will carry out the tyranny.
[00:42:59.639 --> 00:43:00.139]  That's coming up.
[00:43:00.159 --> 00:43:01.460]  We've got the Black Rock situation.
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:12.586]   We have the Dutch military triumphantly defeating the farmers to starve the people to death, but saluting the LGBTPS Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live on this Wednesday edition.
[00:43:12.606 --> 00:43:13.946]  I am coming to you from Florida.
[00:43:13.766 --> 00:43:16.125]  I'm sure it'll be popping in with me as well.
[00:43:16.125 --> 00:43:18.286]  Infowars.com tomorrow, Tuesday.
[00:43:18.286 --> 00:43:21.365]  Please don't forget, the big sales will end this weekend.
[00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:23.346]  They'll be sending them a week or so.
[00:43:23.346 --> 00:43:30.965]   They will end, Infowars.com on X3, 25% off, and more, Infowars.com, and I thank you for your support.
[00:43:30.965 --> 00:43:34.644]   Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live on this Wednesday edition.
[00:43:34.644 --> 00:43:36.846]  I am coming to you from Florida.
[00:43:36.846 --> 00:43:37.925]  I am in Tampa.
[00:43:37.925 --> 00:43:45.005]   Tomorrow, I'm gonna be hosting from in Patrick Rodney Howard Brown's incredible studio.
[00:43:45.005 --> 00:43:48.525]  Satellite uplinks the whole world, you name it.
[00:43:48.505 --> 00:43:50.846]  He's on dish, direct, cable.
[00:43:50.866 --> 00:43:51.966]  It's going to be huge.
[00:43:52.406 --> 00:43:59.908]  I'm going to do some services and some special broadcasts with him coming up on, I think, Friday and Sunday.
[00:44:00.168 --> 00:44:02.348]  So look for all of that.
[00:44:02.368 --> 00:44:06.134]   I'm going to be on Patrick Ben Davids Huge.
[00:44:06.775 --> 00:44:09.857]  Show's been big for six years, but it's one of the top podcasts now.
[00:44:10.617 --> 00:44:13.119]  Gonna be doing that coming up on Saturday.
[00:44:13.139 --> 00:44:24.946]  Got some other interviews lined up as well, and I'll again be hosting all, hell, I may do all four hours like I did on Monday, tomorrow, Thursday, and Friday.
[00:44:25.547 --> 00:44:26.467]  So look for that.
[00:44:26.487 --> 00:44:28.809]  It's a little bit intimidating when you go to a studio.
[00:44:28.869 --> 00:44:32.371]  I mean, I've been to a lot of big studios, and I've been to a lot of big operations.
[00:44:33.072 --> 00:44:35.713]  And it looks like a freaking space station or something over there.
[00:44:39.415 --> 00:44:43.436]  I know what control rooms look like, and I mean, it's like the NSA or something, man.
[00:44:44.136 --> 00:44:45.777]  They're going out all over the world.
[00:44:45.817 --> 00:44:46.317]  It's amazing.
[00:44:47.338 --> 00:44:48.858]  So, look forward to that.
[00:44:49.319 --> 00:44:50.379]  He is such a great guy.
[00:44:50.399 --> 00:44:52.580]  He gave me a watch.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:53.760]  Really, really nice.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.601]  He makes these custom watches, Swiss watches.
[00:44:56.141 --> 00:44:59.883]  Gave me a watch at dinner with him and his wife last night.
[00:45:00.383 --> 00:45:02.684]  So, super, super, super classy guy.
[00:45:03.527 --> 00:45:12.995]  And maybe I'll make him, come on, air with me tomorrow in his studio, drag his awesome self in there with us.
[00:45:13.915 --> 00:45:26.325]  Now, I want to hit this BlackRock news when we come back, and I've got a bunch of other news I want to get to as well, but Tucker Carlson said something last night when he did his fifth installment of his show.
[00:45:28.627 --> 00:45:34.316]   And he said, It makes you not want to go to work.
[00:45:37.797 --> 00:45:39.778]  And that's exactly the feeling I get.
[00:45:40.498 --> 00:45:46.760]  And I'm not going to not go to work, but I'm going to air the Tucker Carlson piece coming up, actually, next segment, too.
[00:45:47.881 --> 00:45:55.223]  I'm going to get to the Black Rock piece, and we'll skip the network break, and I'm going to play the Tucker Carlson piece, because the enemy really wants that off the air.
[00:45:56.124 --> 00:45:58.204]  And then Owen and I will take over at the bottom of the hour.
[00:45:58.264 --> 00:46:02.286]  But it's just incredible.
[00:46:03.228 --> 00:46:08.876]  When he shows how the left's totally above the law and how they commit all these crimes, and it makes you just not want to go to work.
[00:46:09.597 --> 00:46:11.059]  It shows how astute Turner Carlson is.
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.523]  See, that's why communism always falls.
[00:46:15.104 --> 00:46:15.405]  Because...
[00:46:17.452 --> 00:46:22.734]  In North Korea, particularly, but also in Soviet Russia and in China and everywhere, Venezuela.
[00:46:23.275 --> 00:46:35.020]  First, they take the big farms, the big factories, and after a decade or so of privation and destruction, or sometimes even quicker, a decade on average, a lot of times three or four years is fast to go in the case of Russia and North Korea.
[00:46:37.201 --> 00:46:43.084]  They run through all the rich people, then the middle class, and then, oh, you've got a half acre?
[00:46:44.292 --> 00:46:48.015]  And a little shack, and you grow enough to supplement so you don't starve to death?
[00:46:48.855 --> 00:46:53.799]  You have no teeth, you're an old woman, and you grow enough vegetables to save them for the winter that you barely live.
[00:46:54.439 --> 00:46:54.980]  We're taking it.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:55.760]  You're gonna die.
[00:46:56.521 --> 00:46:58.402]  They line her up, shoot her, take her property.
[00:46:58.962 --> 00:47:00.804]  And then they combine those into a combine.
[00:47:01.284 --> 00:47:03.926]  Or they force labor her ass, and then she dies.
[00:47:04.807 --> 00:47:06.448]  And they kick her guts out on the side of the road.
[00:47:06.468 --> 00:47:08.029]  But you know, it's Larry Fink, he's trendy, it's alright.
[00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:11.852]  So, he's the modern death camp operator.
[00:47:12.672 --> 00:47:13.713]  He says you will submit.
[00:47:15.027 --> 00:47:19.330]  And the only way people start fighting that is they just stop working.
[00:47:20.191 --> 00:47:23.873]  And I'm not saying we've gotten to that point because that's going to collapse society and the robots come in.
[00:47:24.174 --> 00:47:26.115]  They know we're going to do the Atlas shrug deal.
[00:47:27.496 --> 00:47:34.561]  The answer is have our own infrastructure, build our own communities, our own systems, and then don't contribute to the new world order system.
[00:47:35.601 --> 00:47:39.044]  That's really, it's like what the Israelites did where they went, we're leaving Egypt.
[00:47:39.364 --> 00:47:40.725]  We're going to build our own thing.
[00:47:41.586 --> 00:47:43.267]  And that's really the model.
[00:47:44.245 --> 00:47:46.007]  That's really the system.
[00:47:47.007 --> 00:47:49.289]  And I love it when the Nazis watch the shows.
[00:47:49.329 --> 00:47:49.729]  I see it.
[00:47:50.009 --> 00:47:52.051]  They go, look, we caught him promoting the Jews.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:47:54.352]  We caught him like it was some secret thing.
[00:47:54.412 --> 00:47:56.174]  No, I mean, I think biblical examples are excellent.
[00:47:56.594 --> 00:47:58.135]  And I think we should follow the Jews example.
[00:47:58.235 --> 00:47:58.655]  That's right.
[00:47:59.556 --> 00:48:00.056]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:00.076 --> 00:48:01.858]  Stay with us.
[00:48:01.878 --> 00:48:06.301]  So one of the oldest examples we have of Exodus is Exodus from the Bible.
[00:48:06.949 --> 00:48:20.937]  More than 3,000 years ago, when Moses leads the Israelites out of bondage under Ramses II, which they've dug up the tablets, and they've dug up the hieroglyphs, and that was all real, and that really happened.
[00:48:22.919 --> 00:48:40.378]   And then we have more modern examples of the pilgrims 400 years ago, plus first trying to leave England to get religious freedom, and then going to the Netherlands, that not working, and then putting everything they had on the Mayflower, And coming to Plymouth Rock, which is interesting.
[00:48:40.438 --> 00:48:44.039]  I don't operate off my ancestors, but I am proud of my ancestors.
[00:48:44.499 --> 00:48:48.581]  My father's side of the family, related to two of the Mayflower folks.
[00:48:49.261 --> 00:48:52.402]  And then on my mother's side, to Miles Standish.
[00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:56.084]  So I mean, I am proud of that venture, proud of that idea.
[00:48:56.644 --> 00:48:58.745]  And I think that exodus idea is the answer.
[00:48:59.285 --> 00:49:11.061]   But because the world's so small now, relatively, and then the population's so big, There's not a new continent, a new world for us to find, but there are new systems and new ideas and new communities and new affiliations.
[00:49:11.841 --> 00:49:17.623]  And so the whole future will be withdrawing from the system non-violently and building our own safe harbors.
[00:49:18.324 --> 00:49:19.444]  That is the entire future.
[00:49:20.345 --> 00:49:35.029]   And so I take an example from my Protestant ancestors, and I take an example from the Israelites, soon to be the Israelites, leaving into the desert, and then there'll be 40 years You know, in the wilderness.
[00:49:35.049 --> 00:49:40.972]  We're not going to be transported to Valhalla on a bed of roses.
[00:49:41.992 --> 00:49:46.155]  Or a feather bed, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[00:49:46.735 --> 00:49:48.156]  But that's really where we are.
[00:49:48.956 --> 00:49:50.437]  The answer is not killing people.
[00:49:50.497 --> 00:49:52.418]  The answer is not revolution physically.
[00:49:53.558 --> 00:49:57.040]  It's culturally, it's spiritually, it's transcending this.
[00:49:57.961 --> 00:50:04.237]   And that's what Christ taught us, and that's absolutely Absolutely true.
[00:50:05.338 --> 00:50:07.359]  So let me do this latest thing.
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:20.731]  I got off the plane yesterday evening in Tampa and was getting my bags and stuff and was getting all my calls that had come in since, you know, the Wi-Fi wasn't working on the plane for some reason.
[00:50:21.572 --> 00:50:23.073]  And at least on my phone, it wasn't.
[00:50:23.113 --> 00:50:24.594]  It was James O'Keefe saying, man, look at this.
[00:50:24.674 --> 00:50:25.155]  It's huge.
[00:50:25.615 --> 00:50:26.736]  This is one of my biggest coups.
[00:50:26.996 --> 00:50:30.980]  And every time he does, it's something bigger or crazier, more powerful in a way.
[00:50:31.792 --> 00:50:32.194]  I don't know.
[00:50:32.235 --> 00:50:33.523]  The force is with him, as they say.
[00:50:33.543 --> 00:50:33.603]  And...
[00:50:37.323 --> 00:50:42.624]  He always puts out like a three-minute clips the first drop, and then there'll be like a 20-minute one that came out today, and I watched that.
[00:50:43.144 --> 00:50:46.045]  But here is this BlackRock recruiter on record.
[00:50:46.145 --> 00:50:49.726]  It's kind of like when they had the Pfizer head of mRNA research.
[00:50:50.066 --> 00:50:51.286]  People thought, this can't be real.
[00:50:51.626 --> 00:50:52.967]  He's so criminal-sounding.
[00:50:53.007 --> 00:50:53.787]  He's so arrogant.
[00:50:54.047 --> 00:50:55.127]  We're taking over your bodies.
[00:50:55.167 --> 00:50:55.787]  It doesn't work.
[00:50:55.807 --> 00:51:00.389]  We create new viruses so we can, you know, roll out new ones and control everyone forever.
[00:51:00.869 --> 00:51:02.349]  It's the gift that keeps on giving.
[00:51:02.409 --> 00:51:03.329]  It's the cash cow.
[00:51:03.749 --> 00:51:05.250]  You know, people are like, okay, this isn't real.
[00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:06.230]  James O'Keefe faked this.
[00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:06.470]  Come on.
[00:51:07.028 --> 00:51:07.929]  And of course it was totally real.
[00:51:07.949 --> 00:51:14.653]  I think James O'Keefe's going to do a stakeout and do all this and then show the head of something and say that it's a lie and destroy all his career when he did.
[00:51:14.894 --> 00:51:15.554]  No.
[00:51:16.094 --> 00:51:21.678]  Past behavior is always indicative and is the best view into what is going to happen in the future.
[00:51:22.099 --> 00:51:23.600]  Like, does this dog hunt well?
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.121]  Does this car run well?
[00:51:25.601 --> 00:51:27.482]  Does this restaurant cook good food?
[00:51:27.523 --> 00:51:28.483]  Does this guy kick ass?
[00:51:29.484 --> 00:51:31.665]  You know, I mean, does this person sing beautifully?
[00:51:31.685 --> 00:51:34.466]   I mean, it's like, It's like we always, oh, they're the good guy.
[00:51:34.486 --> 00:51:36.368]  Let's double check them 500 times, you know.
[00:51:36.848 --> 00:51:40.291]  Oh, I mean, as soon as I saw James O'Keefe say that was real, I went, this is unbelievable.
[00:51:40.311 --> 00:51:41.312]  They're going to say it's not real.
[00:51:41.592 --> 00:51:41.892]  It's real.
[00:51:41.912 --> 00:51:43.433]  I went and looked up the guy, instantly found it out.
[00:51:43.733 --> 00:51:45.555]  But the media went, oh, it's not real for a week.
[00:51:45.775 --> 00:51:46.676]  You know, he made it up.
[00:51:46.716 --> 00:51:48.897]  This is not really a Pfizer executive.
[00:51:48.917 --> 00:51:58.044]  And of course, it was the global head of MRNA, of PR, to sell and push, hey, you want to invest in this?
[00:51:58.064 --> 00:51:58.665]  You want to join us?
[00:51:59.105 --> 00:52:00.346]  We're taking over everybody's bodies.
[00:52:01.015 --> 00:52:01.995]  We're going to rule the world.
[00:52:02.415 --> 00:52:03.756]  No one can stop us.
[00:52:03.796 --> 00:52:04.596]  We make them sick.
[00:52:04.856 --> 00:52:05.877]  We create the viruses.
[00:52:05.957 --> 00:52:06.857]  It's the best business model.
[00:52:08.358 --> 00:52:09.238]  They're in on it, folks.
[00:52:09.298 --> 00:52:11.839]  I mean, high level down to low level now.
[00:52:11.879 --> 00:52:16.280]  That's what evil is, is when the general public goes, I'm tired of working hard being a little guy.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.181]  I'm going to join evil.
[00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:20.682]  Well, if you join evil up front, you get powerful, but you lose your soul.
[00:52:21.505 --> 00:52:25.828]  But joining evil when the Ponzi scheme's collapsing is the dumbest thing ever.
[00:52:26.029 --> 00:52:32.834]  And folks, those of you on the evil bandwagon right now, you're jumping on board when the ship's going down.
[00:52:33.294 --> 00:52:35.716]  So that's where we are.
[00:52:37.377 --> 00:52:44.923]  And the full clip's on InfoWars.com, but here is one of the top recruiters for BlackRock, Larry Fink.
[00:52:46.124 --> 00:52:47.285]  And he says, we rule the world.
[00:52:47.325 --> 00:52:48.306]  We pay all the politicians.
[00:52:48.806 --> 00:52:49.467]  We're taking over.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.221]  They don't want to be in the news.
[00:52:52.723 --> 00:52:53.985]  They don't want people to talk about them.
[00:52:54.486 --> 00:52:56.368]  They don't want to be anywhere on the radar.
[00:52:56.408 --> 00:52:57.149]  Why not?
[00:52:58.611 --> 00:53:04.138]  I don't know, but I suspect it's probably because it's easier to do things when people aren't thinking about it.
[00:53:04.578 --> 00:53:07.262]  All of these financial institutions, they buy politicians.
[00:53:07.582 --> 00:53:08.563]  You can take this big...
[00:53:09.651 --> 00:53:12.593]  I work for a company called BlackRock.
[00:53:12.853 --> 00:53:15.435]  Let me tell you, it's not who's the president is.
[00:53:15.835 --> 00:53:18.697]  It's who's controlling the wallet of the president.
[00:53:19.077 --> 00:53:20.137]  And who's that?
[00:53:20.157 --> 00:53:21.278]  The hedge funds, the banks.
[00:53:21.097 --> 00:53:30.097]   who is the president, who is controlling the wallet and who's that?
[00:53:30.097 --> 00:53:38.097]   the hedge funds, the banks, these guys you can pay in financing, you can buy your candidates
[00:53:38.097 --> 00:53:42.097]   obviously we have the system in place, first there's the senate
[00:53:42.097 --> 00:53:46.097]   and these guys are f***ing shit, you got 10 grand you can buy
[00:53:46.097 --> 00:53:54.097]   I can give you 500k right now, no questions asked, done everybody do that? does blackrock do that?
[00:53:54.097 --> 00:54:02.097]   it doesn't matter who wins, they're my friends on how good war is for blackrock's business
[00:54:02.097 --> 00:54:03.097]  business.
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:07.102]  Do you have any thoughts on the Ukraine-Russia war?
[00:54:07.622 --> 00:54:09.663]  Yeah, I mean, I do have thoughts.
[00:54:09.703 --> 00:54:10.604]  What are they?
[00:54:10.704 --> 00:54:13.305]  Ukraine is good for business.
[00:54:13.365 --> 00:54:14.446]  You know, right?
[00:54:14.546 --> 00:54:15.686]  I'll give an example.
[00:54:15.927 --> 00:54:18.568]  Russia... Russia blows up Ukraine's grains.
[00:54:18.648 --> 00:54:21.830]  The price of wheat is going to go mad up.
[00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:26.212]  The Ukrainian economy is tied very largely to the wheat market.
[00:54:26.252 --> 00:54:27.312]  Global wheat market.
[00:54:27.593 --> 00:54:31.595]  Prices of bread, of... You know, literally everything goes up and down.
[00:54:32.844 --> 00:54:34.605]  This is fantastic if you're trading.
[00:54:35.786 --> 00:54:38.367]  Volatility creates opportunity to make profit.
[00:54:38.567 --> 00:54:41.309]  War is no fucking good for business.
[00:54:41.409 --> 00:54:43.971]  It's exciting when shit goes wrong, right?
[00:54:43.991 --> 00:54:47.613]  BlackRock manages $20 trillion.
[00:54:48.513 --> 00:54:49.834]  It's incomprehensible numbers.
[00:54:50.154 --> 00:54:56.838]  BlackRock's Serge Varley says all of this is above a normal person's understanding.
[00:54:56.878 --> 00:54:58.619]  You're like an undercover reporter.
[00:54:58.739 --> 00:54:59.860]  No, no, no, that's what normal people do.
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:00.560]  I get it, shit.
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:01.321]  This is beyond them.
[00:55:04.153 --> 00:55:06.921]  There's a whole thing of like domination in the world.
[00:55:06.981 --> 00:55:07.542]  A concept.
[00:55:07.643 --> 00:55:08.766]  It's so fucking interesting.
[00:55:12.847 --> 00:55:19.574]  Hi, I'm James O'Keefe with OMG News.
[00:55:20.054 --> 00:55:43.131]   Here we are with our latest story, this time on BlackRock, one of the world's leading asset and investment managers, which owns significant shares of companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Anheuser-Busch, Meta, Target, Procter & Gamble, Comcast, CNN, Fox, and, yes, Pfizer, just to name a few.
[00:55:43.571 --> 00:55:49.512]  At OMG, we do not shy away from exposing powerful companies, and we're not afraid of powerful people.
[00:55:50.152 --> 00:55:57.134]  So we decided to take a look for ourselves at the influence BlackRock has on our politics and the influence they have on our culture.
[00:55:57.494 --> 00:56:05.856]   So to do that, what better place to start a hidden camera investigation than into a self-described Gatekeeper at BlackRock.
[00:56:06.256 --> 00:56:09.737]  You're kind of like a fucking gatekeeper at BlackRock.
[00:56:09.817 --> 00:56:11.077]  Yeah, I am.
[00:56:11.137 --> 00:56:12.758]  I decide people's fates.
[00:56:12.858 --> 00:56:15.939]  Every fucking day, I literally... Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:56:15.999 --> 00:56:19.140]  Again, the full 11-minute report.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.760]  There's another 20-minute report.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.901]  It's all up on fullhorse.com right now.
[00:56:22.941 --> 00:56:23.881]  You want to go get it, you want to go share.
[00:56:24.722 --> 00:56:30.005]  But I remember growing up, like, watching superhero movies where the villain brags about their evil.
[00:56:30.045 --> 00:56:30.825]  That's not real.
[00:56:30.865 --> 00:56:34.968]  Like, if I was a bad guy about to take out my enemy, I would just shoot him instantly.
[00:56:35.028 --> 00:56:35.868]  I'd kill him instantly.
[00:56:36.208 --> 00:56:38.990]  If I had, like, Superman with the Kryptonite, I'd just get him done.
[00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:40.010]  I wouldn't sit there and brag.
[00:56:40.711 --> 00:56:43.332]  But see, the people that wrote those scripts, they understand the criminology.
[00:56:43.652 --> 00:56:46.214]  Criminals actually monologue.
[00:56:46.634 --> 00:56:48.495]  They actually tell you about their master plan.
[00:56:49.733 --> 00:57:04.885]  As I grew older and learned about Mein Kampf and things Hitler wrote and things Julius Caesar wrote, I mean, I learned how powerful people, some totally evil, some twisted, some good, some bad, depending on your perspective, like Julius Caesar, how they operate.
[00:57:04.905 --> 00:57:08.168]  And I realized, my God, they actually love to tell you their master plan.
[00:57:08.848 --> 00:57:10.710]  So here he is saying, I choose fates.
[00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:11.471]  I'm God.
[00:57:11.791 --> 00:57:14.193]  First we take over governments, then we take over individuals.
[00:57:14.493 --> 00:57:15.434]  We rule the earth.
[00:57:16.254 --> 00:57:23.691]   And I guess my Skype broke up for a minute while I was making a key point about Larry I can't rule you.
[00:57:23.972 --> 00:57:25.813]  I don't have the power to do that.
[00:57:25.893 --> 00:57:29.637]  I don't have a quadrillion under management.
[00:57:29.457 --> 00:57:33.277]   If I said I'm gonna run your life, if I said I'm gonna rule you,
[00:57:33.277 --> 00:57:36.977]  I can't rule you, I don't have the power to do that.
[00:57:36.977 --> 00:57:38.937]  I don't have a quadrillion under management.
[00:57:38.937 --> 00:57:47.957]   I don't own a majority in over 5,000 major companies and pieces of tens of thousands of others.
[00:57:46.502 --> 00:57:48.222]  I'm not the number one owner of real estate in the world.
[00:57:48.242 --> 00:57:50.423]  I'm not the number one owner of Big Pharma in the world.
[00:57:50.663 --> 00:57:53.263]  I'm not the number one owner of defense stocks in the world, like BlackRock.
[00:57:54.624 --> 00:58:02.166]  And so, telecommunications and all of it, and all these big law firms, this is who's pushing anti-free speech.
[00:58:02.186 --> 00:58:03.486]  This is who's pushing forced shots.
[00:58:03.506 --> 00:58:04.406]  This is who's pushing alternative.
[00:58:04.806 --> 00:58:10.828]  But if I got up here and said, I'm going to rule you, I'm better than you, you'd say, well, you're a jerk and arrogant, I don't like you.
[00:58:10.908 --> 00:58:11.848]  And you should have had to.
[00:58:12.611 --> 00:58:19.477]  But when somebody has the power to actually get it done, if you submit, you should really take that person seriously.
[00:58:20.017 --> 00:58:31.948]   And then when his representative, who's high up, by the way, in BlackRock, another young sociopath, bare minimum, probably an American psycho, sits there, And just last bragging to some girl.
[00:58:32.088 --> 00:58:32.648]  I rule.
[00:58:32.888 --> 00:58:33.509]  They're nothing.
[00:58:33.569 --> 00:58:34.389]  We own people.
[00:58:34.629 --> 00:58:35.430]  We rule the earth.
[00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:36.170]  They're nothing.
[00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:37.330]  No one can stop us.
[00:58:37.651 --> 00:58:43.153]  You should take that type of megalomania as a threat to every facet of your life.
[00:58:44.314 --> 00:58:44.654]  Period.
[00:58:44.674 --> 00:58:46.855]  Now I'm going to talk right after the break.
[00:58:46.875 --> 00:58:50.856]  I'm going to introduce someone, Troyer, who's got some big news coming up here in a moment.
[00:58:51.217 --> 00:58:56.319]  When we come back from break, we're going to air the full Tucker Carlson piece and skip that next break.
[00:58:56.719 --> 00:58:58.580]  At the bottom of the hour, we're coming with Tucker Carlson.
[00:58:59.631 --> 00:59:04.193]  Because he explains all this in a beautiful way in his fifth big drop he just did.
[00:59:04.473 --> 00:59:13.116]  And we've got a debate and we've got to discuss how do we break the back of the globalists without losing our souls and without playing into their plan to make society collapse?
[00:59:13.156 --> 00:59:18.479]  How do we make sure their systems collapse but we hold ourselves and others up?
[00:59:18.499 --> 00:59:22.940]  Because we can't just save ourselves, we've got to save the public or die trying.
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:25.281]  Because if we don't, God will forsake us.
[00:59:25.942 --> 00:59:26.962]  God will cut us off.
[00:59:28.041 --> 00:59:28.862]  It's very, very simple.
[00:59:29.262 --> 00:59:31.003]  God wants our flesh, our skin in the game.
[00:59:31.944 --> 00:59:33.084]  So we've got that information.
[00:59:33.125 --> 00:59:44.052]  But just imagine the attitude and the whole woke Black Lives Matter and the LGBT-P-S-Satan movement and all of its black rock.
[00:59:44.072 --> 00:59:54.419]  When you wonder why is Anheuser-Busch kamikaze-ing with Bud Light, and you wonder why Target's kamikaze-ing, and why the NBA's kamikaze-ing, and why North Face, which is some great products.
[00:59:54.479 --> 00:59:55.280]  I can't ever wear them again.
[00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:57.021]  I'd throw them away, man.
[00:59:59.113 --> 01:00:02.415]  Jackets I bought in the last 10 years, fit right in the winter, waterproof.
[01:00:02.455 --> 01:00:03.676]  I just said, they're going in the trash, folks.
[01:00:04.136 --> 01:00:08.979]  Well, you got to say BlackRock controls all those companies.
[01:00:08.999 --> 01:00:21.147]  So BlackRock lost a trillion dollars of investment last year for pushing ESGs when state attorney generals and state governments said, we're pulling our money out of you because you want to control the policies of our government with this money.
[01:00:21.787 --> 01:00:24.229]  And Fink said, we're abandoning this.
[01:00:24.929 --> 01:00:33.546]   And then he had all the companies they want to control just and kamikaze. So he's like Tojo in Japan as the American
[01:00:33.546 --> 01:00:38.445]   fleet approaches in 1944 and it's island hopping and pushing up closer and closer to
[01:00:38.445 --> 01:00:38.826]  Japan.
[01:00:38.826 --> 01:00:44.105]   And so he's like, "Oh, I'm not your enemy. I'm not fighting you." But he's got his kamikazes.
[01:00:48.746 --> 01:01:00.826]   And then Hollywood movies, a hundred million spinning on movies.
[01:01:01.041 --> 01:01:06.345]  And it just goes on and on and on and on as they sin.
[01:01:07.826 --> 01:01:09.027]  Target loses 24 billion.
[01:01:11.008 --> 01:01:12.430]  And he goes, fire more.
[01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:20.036]  And if you understand, this is their kamikaze operation and BlackRock's got the Rothschilds control central banks.
[01:01:20.416 --> 01:01:24.416]   If he loses 50 trillion, then he's got more power, more Satan.
[01:01:24.416 --> 01:01:27.215]  We energize you now. We lift you up.
[01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:30.681]  That's why these companies fight and battle.
[01:01:31.061 --> 01:01:39.692]  The more they lose, they just... When they saw Anheuser-Busch go down, or they saw Target go down, all thousands of companies just scrambled forward to be even more radical.
[01:01:40.834 --> 01:02:02.750]  Because they want to show, think they are subservient, and then think like a big giant monstrous bat will lean over his baby bats and just vomit the rotten flesh of the dead, and the rotten flesh of the abortuaries, the rotten cultural death of the wars, and all their satanic money, just vomit the giant meals into their greedy little mouths.
[01:02:03.851 --> 01:02:04.692]  So there's your analogy.
[01:02:06.525 --> 01:02:08.606]  And so they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:02:08.846 --> 01:02:12.248]  So when they get rid of Hippocratic Oath in medicine and kill people, it's BlackRock.
[01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:15.990]  When they're trying to teach your five-year-old to have their penis cut off, it's BlackRock.
[01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:18.712]  When they're teaching you're inherently bad because you're white, it's BlackRock.
[01:02:20.273 --> 01:02:27.117]  And they just sit back thinking you're animals and you're dumb and you can't do anything and Larry Fink is your God and he's gonna teach you.
[01:02:27.137 --> 01:02:29.498]  And he's gonna make you do what he says.
[01:02:30.467 --> 01:02:31.728]  And he has disdain for you.
[01:02:31.768 --> 01:02:32.989]  He has nothing but hatred for you.
[01:02:33.429 --> 01:02:35.830]  And you just sit there and you just buy into whatever he says.
[01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:41.694]  But whenever you see something on the news, whenever you see something at university, whenever something's anti-human, it's Larry Fink, baby.
[01:02:42.094 --> 01:02:47.717]  It's Larry Fink, and he's just the manager for the big old money that thinks you're dumb and is going to take everything you've got.
[01:02:48.198 --> 01:02:51.760]  Here's a short clip of him talking about how they're going to use the money and power to control you.
[01:02:52.517 --> 01:02:55.599]  Behaviors are going to have to change, and this is one thing we're asking companies.
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:01.283]  You have to force behaviors, and at BlackRock, we are forcing behaviors.
[01:03:04.665 --> 01:03:06.066]  You have to force behaviors.
[01:03:06.086 --> 01:03:06.687]  That's called rape.
[01:03:07.668 --> 01:03:09.589]  And here at BlackRock, we're forcing behaviors.
[01:03:09.729 --> 01:03:12.111]  We are self-anointed.
[01:03:12.131 --> 01:03:14.692]  In the full clip, we talk about cutting the carbon off, cutting your food off.
[01:03:15.113 --> 01:03:17.274]  Oh, but there'll be no carbon cutoff in China and India.
[01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:17.975]  They get unlimited.
[01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:21.137]  You don't get it because you're Westerners who are Christians.
[01:03:21.972 --> 01:03:29.537]  And who we've analyzed the globalists have, I'm speaking as them, might be able to be our cashless society, Margaret the Beast operation.
[01:03:31.018 --> 01:03:39.483]  So you're being targeted no matter how you lapdog and hop up and down and, you know, jet escalator, is that the word?
[01:03:40.444 --> 01:03:43.025]  Ballon to them.
[01:03:44.306 --> 01:03:47.188]  And so you may want to live as a carpet, folks, but these people don't care.
[01:03:47.708 --> 01:03:54.100]   They have nothing but deep Seated disdain for you, but the good news is their entire project is falling apart.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.380]  They don't know what to do.
[01:03:55.501 --> 01:04:01.702]  I saw a few months ago, Chelsea Clinton now heads up the Clinton Foundation saying, after COVID, even less people believe in us and what are we going to do?
[01:04:02.062 --> 01:04:09.104]  They're coming out against us and they're speaking out against us and we got to get even more hardcore and work together as corporations to make them do the right thing.
[01:04:11.085 --> 01:04:17.127]  So they've given themselves this view that they're the angels and they're the saviors and they're the good guys, but no, you're the monsters.
[01:04:17.447 --> 01:04:18.227]  You're the bad guys.
[01:04:19.645 --> 01:04:23.347]  But we just have to get the general public to realize as a survival mechanism that they've got to get involved.
[01:04:23.387 --> 01:04:24.227]  They've got to get engaged.
[01:04:24.608 --> 01:04:28.529]  They've got to take action or we are going to lose everything.
[01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:31.171]  Our humanity, everything.
[01:04:33.112 --> 01:04:37.574]  All right, I want to bring Owen in here in a few minutes to just talk about the big picture here.
[01:04:37.634 --> 01:04:43.617]  And I just use him as a microcosm of the deception that's going on via the enemy.
[01:04:44.697 --> 01:04:47.499]  But before we do that, I'm just gonna remind listeners one more time.
[01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:50.045]  There's boycotting and there's boycotting.
[01:04:50.526 --> 01:04:53.708]  And the globalists know if we ever do a boycott, we're the boycott.
[01:04:53.748 --> 01:04:57.371]  Boycott globalist stuff, boycott patriot pro-human stuff.
[01:04:58.132 --> 01:05:06.558]  You boycott organic food and a supplement market, we build a supplement market, we build organic food, it becomes the future.
[01:05:08.079 --> 01:05:09.120]  You boycott the globalists.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:14.304]  But they're all about vertical integration with their lockdowns and things to make you only go to them to shut down all the competition.
[01:05:14.344 --> 01:05:15.165]  It's a consolidation.
[01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:25.719]  And so that's why people have to understand that bycotting InfoWars, deciding you're going to support InfoWars and other people like us is the game changer.
[01:05:25.979 --> 01:05:27.320]  It's why they want the social credit score.
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:28.880]  It's why they want to lock down all the competition.
[01:05:29.161 --> 01:05:38.786]  Because anytime you can decide in a free market where you want to spend money, where you want to promote things, who you want to support, and even if you have a small percentage still left, people want that freedom.
[01:05:38.826 --> 01:05:39.787]  They'll all come support it.
[01:05:40.007 --> 01:05:42.509]  And overnight there's a revolution and the globalists are displaced.
[01:05:43.229 --> 01:05:44.510]  So they're super scared of that.
[01:05:45.333 --> 01:05:50.496]  So spreading the word about the broadcast, buying the products, praying for the broadcast, all of that is a boycott.
[01:05:51.157 --> 01:05:52.198]  Buy in force.
[01:05:52.838 --> 01:05:53.438]  I'm on the road.
[01:05:53.458 --> 01:05:55.159]  I'll be in a professional studio tomorrow.
[01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:58.121]  And so I've been having some technical problems where it's been cutting out.
[01:05:58.602 --> 01:05:59.682]  This is a rule of thumb.
[01:05:59.762 --> 01:06:03.845]  When my Scott cuts out next time, which I'm not doing the whole show right now.
[01:06:04.305 --> 01:06:05.946]  So this is a drill for this moment right now.
[01:06:06.347 --> 01:06:10.429]  So the next time the Scott cuts out, which it's going to do, it's already done it three times.
[01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:13.031]  We're just going to play a short one minute promo.
[01:06:13.792 --> 01:06:16.594]  Because it's only been taking about a minute on average to get me back on.
[01:06:17.414 --> 01:06:19.595]  Okay, so just have a great program, do a great job.
[01:06:19.735 --> 01:06:20.616]  I'm directing from the road here.
[01:06:21.256 --> 01:06:24.878]  A one-minute promo, a Visa Redetta two-minute promo, something like that.
[01:06:25.038 --> 01:06:25.899]  Next time it does that, okay?
[01:06:25.999 --> 01:06:26.239]  Thanks.
[01:06:26.599 --> 01:06:28.400]  I don't have the money to have a crew with me, by the way.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.822]  I can go battle and go on shows, promote InfoWars, send money back, fund it.
[01:06:33.383 --> 01:06:34.123]  I'm paying for it.
[01:06:34.403 --> 01:06:34.884]  I'm doing it.
[01:06:35.204 --> 01:06:35.664]  I'm nothing.
[01:06:35.944 --> 01:06:36.404]  I'm trash.
[01:06:36.644 --> 01:06:37.045]  I'm scum.
[01:06:37.405 --> 01:06:48.036]   But, in the name of keeping the crew employed, and in the name of keeping InfoWars going on, I'm here with outside funding of my own dime to come promote InfoWars and keep it on the air.
[01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:48.717]  Okay?
[01:06:49.017 --> 01:06:49.938]  So that's why I don't have crew.
[01:06:49.958 --> 01:06:51.099]  I don't have backups.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.401]  I got my own stuff going on.
[01:06:52.681 --> 01:06:53.482]  I don't have a hotspot.
[01:06:53.682 --> 01:06:54.162]  I have nothing.
[01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:55.023]  And I'm not complaining.
[01:06:55.404 --> 01:06:55.924]  It's how it works.
[01:06:55.984 --> 01:06:57.886]  And if they run me out, it's fine.
[01:06:58.147 --> 01:06:59.168]  But they're not going to make me quit.
[01:06:59.688 --> 01:07:01.450]  I'm going to just keep fighting until the end.
[01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:04.353]  So I go back to what I was just telling you, okay?
[01:07:05.674 --> 01:07:06.956]  I go back to what I was just telling you, okay?
[01:07:09.344 --> 01:07:10.144]  We need funds.
[01:07:10.305 --> 01:07:12.025]  We need support with a buy cut.
[01:07:12.506 --> 01:07:13.466]  We have great products.
[01:07:13.866 --> 01:07:19.049]  You need RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, are great products.
[01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.829]  They're great nootropics.
[01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:23.391]  They're 50% off together, 40% off individually.
[01:07:23.952 --> 01:07:26.673]  Super Female Vitality is the same as Super Female Vitality.
[01:07:26.693 --> 01:07:27.593]  It's just a pink label.
[01:07:27.613 --> 01:07:28.594]  We're out of Super Female Vitality.
[01:07:28.974 --> 01:07:29.995]  Super Female is the same thing.
[01:07:30.015 --> 01:07:31.395]  Great for libido, stamina, and energy.
[01:07:31.415 --> 01:07:32.416]  50% off.
[01:07:32.516 --> 01:07:32.976]  Great deal.
[01:07:33.316 --> 01:07:34.997]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:07:35.017 --> 01:07:35.718]  We have the Nitric Boost.
[01:07:35.738 --> 01:07:36.338]  So good for your heart.
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:40.983]  All these sales 100% will end next Monday.
[01:07:41.783 --> 01:07:42.044]  All right?
[01:07:42.544 --> 01:07:45.707]  They will end next Monday because we're close to selling out of it.
[01:07:45.967 --> 01:07:46.908]  But we're in a catch-22.
[01:07:46.968 --> 01:07:49.249]  We have to keep selling it because we need the funds.
[01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:54.173]  We have X3, the triiodine, that's so good for your immune system, your whole body.
[01:07:54.334 --> 01:07:56.095]  It is 25% off.
[01:07:56.235 --> 01:07:58.017]  It will sell out in just a few weeks.
[01:07:58.257 --> 01:08:03.221]  But I extended another week of sale because people need it, you need to experience it, and we need the funds right now.
[01:08:04.189 --> 01:08:05.770]  And yes, donations are great.
[01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:08.191]  That helps us with issues we've got.
[01:08:09.592 --> 01:08:13.214]  You know, I would love to go cover a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:08:14.255 --> 01:08:18.117]  And I may have to do a whole other show separate just to be able to go cover things on the road.
[01:08:18.677 --> 01:08:22.139]  I'll still do the Free Speech Systems thing or whatever, but I'm gonna do whatever I have to because I gotta get back on the road.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:26.682]  I've gotta be able to, you know, go out and cover these events and these things.
[01:08:26.722 --> 01:08:29.903]  But if the funds aren't there, or for whatever reason we can't do it, who knows?
[01:08:30.083 --> 01:08:30.984]  But I'm not quitting!
[01:08:32.714 --> 01:08:36.897]  I'm forced out, that's the way it is, but that's how serious all of this is.
[01:08:36.957 --> 01:08:42.800]  So, infowarestore.com, get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, and oh, it's going to take over.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:48.543]  But first, we're going to play the whole Tucker Carlson piece, we're going to skip this break, and no one's sure it's going to take over.
[01:08:49.104 --> 01:08:50.244]  And then, who knows?
[01:08:50.264 --> 01:08:51.345]  If I'm able to, who knows?
[01:08:52.326 --> 01:08:58.089]  I'll host the show tomorrow, 11 a.m., at 3 p.m., out of Rodney Howard's operations here in Tampa.
[01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:59.470]  I'm going to keep fighting.
[01:09:00.243 --> 01:09:01.044]  And, uh, that's it.
[01:09:01.385 --> 01:09:04.348]  But I don't know if the general public knows how close the fight is with New Orleans.
[01:09:04.408 --> 01:09:07.312]  I mean, we're winning, but we're also, all of us, out of gas in the fight.
[01:09:07.752 --> 01:09:09.935]  It's like we're winning the battle, but running out of gas with our tanks.
[01:09:10.656 --> 01:09:12.898]  And so if the tanks don't get the gas, we don't finish winning the battle.
[01:09:12.918 --> 01:09:14.120]  It's really simple.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:15.902]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:09:15.922 --> 01:09:16.483]  Take action now.
[01:09:17.438 --> 01:09:18.879]  Hey, it's Tucker Carlson.
[01:09:19.219 --> 01:09:32.867]  This spring, word began to circulate in Washington that the House Oversight Committee, under its new chairman, Congressman Jamie Comer, had discovered criminal behavior after reviewing thousands of pages of the Biden family's bank records.
[01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:39.477]  Now publicly, to the extent they responded at all, the White House dismissed the investigation as, of course, politically motivated.
[01:09:39.938 --> 01:09:41.440]  In any case, irrelevant.
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:48.289]  Hunter Biden was an adult, so his business dealings had nothing at all to do with his father, in this case, the President of the United States.
[01:09:49.210 --> 01:09:52.553]  But in private, everybody understood it wasn't quite that simple.
[01:09:53.154 --> 01:10:01.362]  There has long been overwhelming evidence that Joe and Hunter Biden's financial lives are not separate at all, but deeply intertwined.
[01:10:01.962 --> 01:10:06.427]  On Hunter Biden's laptop, there's a suggestion that the two of them, even at one point, shared a bank account.
[01:10:06.983 --> 01:10:11.987]  And of course, Hunter Biden wrote himself that he kicked back cash from his foreign business deals to his father.
[01:10:12.127 --> 01:10:13.027]  He wrote that bitterly.
[01:10:13.868 --> 01:10:21.514]  So the Oversight Committee's investigation was potentially a disaster for the White House, a scandal, possibly even the prelude to criminal charges.
[01:10:22.234 --> 01:10:27.158]  So in order to get ahead of all of that, Joe Biden's handlers did the one thing they could do.
[01:10:27.638 --> 01:10:32.782]  They set up an MSNBC interview to preemptively whitewash whatever Jamie Comer might find.
[01:10:33.723 --> 01:10:34.884]  Here's the result of that.
[01:10:35.184 --> 01:10:36.485]  This aired on May 5th.
[01:10:37.086 --> 01:10:39.188]  Sir, there is something personal that's affecting you.
[01:10:39.248 --> 01:10:43.691]  Your son, while there's no ties to you, could be charged by your Department of Justice.
[01:10:43.751 --> 01:10:45.293]  How will that impact your presidency?
[01:10:45.953 --> 01:10:47.815]  First of all, my son's done nothing wrong.
[01:10:48.596 --> 01:10:49.196]  I trust him.
[01:10:49.817 --> 01:10:50.557]  I have faith in him.
[01:10:50.577 --> 01:10:54.621]  And it impacts my presidency by making me feel proud of him.
[01:10:55.822 --> 01:10:56.642]  Okay!
[01:10:56.822 --> 01:10:58.264]  Time for the master class!
[01:10:58.344 --> 01:10:59.705]  For free, you can audit it!
[01:11:00.405 --> 01:11:00.906]  Here it goes.
[01:11:01.406 --> 01:11:01.626]  Sir?
[01:11:02.731 --> 01:11:04.511]  Showing appropriate respect, says the shill.
[01:11:05.092 --> 01:11:07.912]  There is something personal that's affecting you.
[01:11:08.232 --> 01:11:08.853]  Note the wording.
[01:11:09.453 --> 01:11:09.833]  Personal.
[01:11:09.873 --> 01:11:11.093]  Not of public concern.
[01:11:11.353 --> 01:11:13.374]  Nothing law enforcement might be interested in.
[01:11:13.794 --> 01:11:14.454]  But personal.
[01:11:14.614 --> 01:11:16.235]  A sad family tragedy.
[01:11:16.635 --> 01:11:17.355]  That's the framing.
[01:11:17.515 --> 01:11:18.075]  And then this.
[01:11:18.655 --> 01:11:20.956]  A sentence choreographed to the letter.
[01:11:21.756 --> 01:11:27.418]  Your son, while there's no ties to you, could be charged by your Department of Justice.
[01:11:28.078 --> 01:11:28.498]  Got that?
[01:11:29.332 --> 01:11:30.674]  Well, there's no tie to you.
[01:11:31.395 --> 01:11:33.678]  So the answer is, in fact, in the question.
[01:11:33.778 --> 01:11:42.110]  Whatever Hunter Biden goes down for, and we know he is going to be charged because MSNBC said so, but when that happens, that's Hunter's problem.
[01:11:42.751 --> 01:11:44.493]  It's got nothing to do with Joe Biden.
[01:11:44.994 --> 01:11:46.055]  Rest easy, America.
[01:11:47.429 --> 01:11:51.672]  Five days later, the Oversight Committee released its findings, and they were, in fact, devastating.
[01:11:51.852 --> 01:12:03.600]  Quote, Bank records show the Biden family, their business associates, and their companies, their many companies, received over $10 million from foreign nationals and their related companies, the committee wrote.
[01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:14.267]  Investigators had, quote, identified payments to Biden family members from foreign companies while Joe Biden served as vice president and after he left public office.
[01:12:15.615 --> 01:12:16.996]  So actually there was something there.
[01:12:17.276 --> 01:12:18.557]  It was a scandal.
[01:12:19.077 --> 01:12:21.939]  Racketeering, money laundering, wire fraud.
[01:12:21.979 --> 01:12:25.220]  Those are some of the crimes that Biden seemed to have committed.
[01:12:25.701 --> 01:12:28.322]  In addition, of course, to selling out the United States for cash.
[01:12:29.343 --> 01:12:30.343]  So what would happen to them?
[01:12:31.344 --> 01:12:39.128]  Well, Donald Trump had an idea, quote, Trump wrote that about two weeks ago.
[01:12:39.649 --> 01:12:41.670]  And it turned out those were prescient words.
[01:12:42.190 --> 01:12:44.972]  This morning, Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to pretty much nothing.
[01:12:45.632 --> 01:12:50.813]  Biden pled to two misdemeanor tax evasion charges, then entered a diversion on a federal gun charge.
[01:12:51.353 --> 01:12:51.753]  That's it.
[01:12:52.593 --> 01:12:56.314]  As far as Merrick Garland's Justice Department is concerned, Hunter Biden is done.
[01:12:57.194 --> 01:13:00.895]  There was no pre-dawn raid, carried live simultaneously on CNN.
[01:13:01.335 --> 01:13:04.035]  There was no perp walk, no handcuffs, no press conference.
[01:13:05.036 --> 01:13:06.776]  Above all, there was no felony.
[01:13:07.876 --> 01:13:11.697]  Hunter Biden, who broke federal gun laws, can still carry a gun.
[01:13:12.697 --> 01:13:14.138]  It's like it all never happened.
[01:13:14.818 --> 01:13:17.639]  In fact, the Justice Department just baptized Hunter Biden.
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:21.161]  A lifetime of sins washed away in an instant.
[01:13:21.421 --> 01:13:22.502]  It was a secular miracle.
[01:13:23.342 --> 01:13:26.924]  Most miraculous of all, Hunter Biden somehow escaped a FARA charge.
[01:13:27.724 --> 01:13:32.427]  FARA is the Foreign Agent Registration Act, and it is exactly what its name suggests.
[01:13:33.147 --> 01:13:41.191]  Under federal law, if you are acting as an agent of a foreign nation in Washington, you are required to register with our government to let everybody know.
[01:13:42.327 --> 01:13:48.651]  Well, for decades, pretty much nobody in Washington did register under FARA, and precisely no one was ever prosecuted for it.
[01:13:49.072 --> 01:13:49.412]  No one.
[01:13:50.333 --> 01:13:55.296]  But starting several years ago, the Justice Department began sending people to prison on FARA violations.
[01:13:55.836 --> 01:14:00.700]  The official explanation was, we're cracking down on foreign influence in Washington.
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:03.882]  And of course, privately, everyone in Washington laughed.
[01:14:03.982 --> 01:14:04.943]  They knew that was absurd.
[01:14:05.802 --> 01:14:07.423]  In fact, it's the opposite of the truth.
[01:14:07.963 --> 01:14:11.244]  Foreign powers have never had more power in Washington.
[01:14:11.624 --> 01:14:21.008]  Their agents are everywhere, in every federal agency and throughout business, down to and including in executive positions at various social media companies.
[01:14:21.928 --> 01:14:24.369]  The Biden administration knows all of this, and it's not a problem.
[01:14:24.949 --> 01:14:26.550]  In fact, it's their policy.
[01:14:27.523 --> 01:14:36.996]  From the administration's perspective, the concerns and the demands of, say, the Chinese government, or particularly the Ukrainian government, are far more important than the needs of American voters.
[01:14:37.496 --> 01:14:39.519]  We're cracking down on foreign influence.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:40.420]  Please.
[01:14:41.485 --> 01:14:50.347]  The point, the only point, of enforcing FARA, after decades of ignoring it, is to harass and imprison high-profile political opponents.
[01:14:50.907 --> 01:14:54.747]  Trump donor Elliott Brody pled to a FARA violation a few years ago.
[01:14:55.127 --> 01:14:57.808]  So did Trump campaign manager, famously, Paul Manafort.
[01:14:58.168 --> 01:14:58.848]  He went to prison.
[01:14:59.468 --> 01:15:03.109]  Last year, the DOJ went after Trump confidant Steve Wynn under FARA.
[01:15:03.509 --> 01:15:07.950]  But in the end, the Biden administration overreached so comically that the whole thing was thrown out by a judge.
[01:15:08.610 --> 01:15:09.270]  But they tried.
[01:15:10.293 --> 01:15:18.196]  So as long as they're trying, if it was a fair system, Hunter Biden would be first on the list of those next to be charged with a FARA violation.
[01:15:18.216 --> 01:15:19.116]  In fact, many of them.
[01:15:20.176 --> 01:15:21.877]  Hunter Biden was a foreign agent.
[01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:23.117]  He never registered as one.
[01:15:23.638 --> 01:15:25.878]  But for years, that's exactly what he was.
[01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:31.900]  He sold access to his father and other lawmakers to the Chinese and the Ukrainians and countries throughout the world.
[01:15:32.701 --> 01:15:33.821]  There's no debate about that.
[01:15:33.941 --> 01:15:35.742]  The FBI has known about it for years.
[01:15:36.202 --> 01:15:38.783]  For years, they've had possession of Hunter Biden's laptop.
[01:15:39.639 --> 01:15:41.019]  But they didn't charge him for it today.
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:42.120]  They never will.
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:43.680]  Why?
[01:15:44.441 --> 01:15:45.301]  Well, you know the answer.
[01:15:45.681 --> 01:15:47.122]  Hunter Biden has good genes.
[01:15:48.042 --> 01:15:54.844]  A more interesting question, though, which is another question the feds will never consider, is what does Hunter Biden do for a living now?
[01:15:56.105 --> 01:15:58.966]  This is a man with no obvious job and, of course, zero skills.
[01:15:59.386 --> 01:16:00.926]  He spent midlife smoking crack.
[01:16:01.786 --> 01:16:05.748]  Yet somehow he's managed to live pretty well despite rising inflation.
[01:16:06.618 --> 01:16:10.682]  He's been living in big houses in the costliest residential neighborhoods in the world.
[01:16:11.583 --> 01:16:15.226]  He's been paying his stripper baby mom a $20,000 a month in child support.
[01:16:16.187 --> 01:16:25.315]  And he has retained a team of the most expensive lawyers in the country who spend quite a bit of time sending threatening letters to anyone who asks questions about how they're being paid.
[01:16:25.976 --> 01:16:27.377]  We can confirm that firsthand.
[01:16:28.433 --> 01:16:31.956]  So again, what does Hunter Biden do for work?
[01:16:32.516 --> 01:16:34.237]  That's a fair question, and tonight we have the answer.
[01:16:35.038 --> 01:16:37.099]  For years, Hunter Biden was an influence peddler.
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:40.102]  Now, Hunter Biden is a self-actualizer.
[01:16:40.682 --> 01:16:43.004]  He self-actualizes for a living.
[01:16:43.464 --> 01:16:46.807]  He gets in touch with himself, his feelings, and he follows his muse.
[01:16:47.747 --> 01:16:51.350]  Here he is explaining his new vocation in a 2019 ABC News interview.
[01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:51.950]  This is new.
[01:16:55.312 --> 01:16:55.893]  Yeah.
[01:16:56.493 --> 01:17:00.656]  But now he's opening the doors to a place never captured by a paparazzi's lens.
[01:17:01.096 --> 01:17:04.758]  His refuge, an art studio where he finds solace in painting.
[01:17:04.899 --> 01:17:06.099]  What's the goal eventually?
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.601]  Um, no goal.
[01:17:08.861 --> 01:17:09.982]  That's the perfect part about it.
[01:17:10.002 --> 01:17:11.723]  It literally keeps me sane.
[01:17:12.343 --> 01:17:13.364]  His refuge!
[01:17:13.724 --> 01:17:15.786]  Far from the paparazzi's lens!
[01:17:16.957 --> 01:17:19.019]  In other words, we're not the Babarazzi, we're ABC News.
[01:17:19.359 --> 01:17:20.340]  What's the goal of this?
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:21.661]  Your refuge?
[01:17:21.761 --> 01:17:24.643]  There's no goal, he says, grinning with those fake teeth.
[01:17:25.123 --> 01:17:26.144]  It just keeps me sane.
[01:17:26.644 --> 01:17:27.585]  But actually, there was a goal.
[01:17:27.885 --> 01:17:33.510]  And if you didn't know what a virtuous person Hunter Biden was, you might think it looked a lot like money laundering.
[01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:37.872]  Two years after that interview, Hunter Biden was selling prints of his art.
[01:17:37.972 --> 01:17:47.058]  And to be clear, just the prints, not the quote, art itself, but effectively photocopies of it for $75,000 a pop.
[01:17:47.578 --> 01:17:51.600]  Apparently, Hunter Biden moved five of these repros in just days.
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:59.980]   That's $375,000 in less than a week for signing copies of your fake art.
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:07.260]   As for the paintings themselves, childish self-indulgent blots, those sold for half a million dollars apiece.
[01:18:07.459 --> 01:18:09.719]  So the question is, who bought them and why?
[01:18:10.479 --> 01:18:11.600]  It'd be interesting to know.
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:13.160]  There's a story there for sure.
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:14.840]  But of course, we have no right to know.
[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:17.521]  There's no public policy implication.
[01:18:17.581 --> 01:18:22.182]  It's not like Hunter Biden's finances have anything to do with his father's finances.
[01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:30.933]  Meanwhile, once his father did become president, corporate publisher Simon & Schuster lined up as well to pay Hunter Biden's bills.
[01:18:31.433 --> 01:18:38.976]  According to news reports, Simon & Schuster gave Hunter Biden millions of dollars for his highly selective account of his wholly unaccomplished life.
[01:18:39.696 --> 01:18:45.802]  And then the publisher lined up brainless celebrity endorsers like Dave Eggers and Stephen King to promote it.
[01:18:46.623 --> 01:18:58.736]   King, who apparently will say anything if it helps the party, called Hunter Biden's silly manuscript a, quote, And then Stephen King described Hunter Biden himself as beautiful.
[01:18:59.737 --> 01:19:04.819]  Needless to say, the book sold miserably, but Hunter Biden got to keep the millions, and that was the point.
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:06.240]  And so on.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:08.701]  This kind of thing apparently happened a lot.
[01:19:09.502 --> 01:19:14.584]  Again, there seems to be a story here, and we think it's probably worth learning a lot more about it and bringing it to you.
[01:19:15.144 --> 01:19:16.324]  In the coming weeks, we will.
[01:19:17.005 --> 01:19:20.926]  In the meantime, though, the question is, what can we learn from Hunter Biden's plea deal today?
[01:19:21.446 --> 01:19:22.526]  First off, the obvious.
[01:19:23.067 --> 01:19:25.467]  For the children of the people in charge, there are no penalties.
[01:19:25.647 --> 01:19:26.968]  There are only upsides.
[01:19:27.528 --> 01:19:28.328]  They're princelings.
[01:19:28.728 --> 01:19:29.789]  They can do what they want.
[01:19:30.714 --> 01:19:32.575]  You are not, therefore you can't.
[01:19:33.195 --> 01:19:41.660]  So don't get any ideas about cheating on your taxes or violating federal gun laws unless you want to celebrate next year's Father's Day through the glass in the visitors room.
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:46.723]  The rules definitely apply to you, including rules you don't yet know exist.
[01:19:47.843 --> 01:19:50.746]  But there is also a deeper lesson here, a more disturbing one.
[01:19:51.487 --> 01:20:01.355]  What we're watching through Hunter Biden's life and through the Biden administration, now entering its third year, is the total inversion of virtue.
[01:20:02.296 --> 01:20:06.720]  What was once considered admirable is now derided as stupid, if not racist.
[01:20:07.401 --> 01:20:15.868]   That would include achievement, intelligence, honesty, self-control, humility, Those are features of the old America.
[01:20:15.908 --> 01:20:17.450]  Those were yesterday's virtues.
[01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:18.151]  They are gone.
[01:20:19.132 --> 01:20:25.600]  In their place, all that we once considered contemptible and repulsive, we're told to worship that now.
[01:20:26.923 --> 01:20:29.004]  Here's a small example, but we think a revealing one.
[01:20:29.664 --> 01:20:42.551]  In addition to his many other sins, Joe Biden has hired what has to be the single dumbest, nastiest, most dishonest, most ridiculous person he could possibly find for the very public position of White House Press Secretary.
[01:20:43.211 --> 01:20:44.392]  There's a point to it, of course.
[01:20:44.792 --> 01:20:46.393]  It was a humiliation exercise.
[01:20:47.073 --> 01:20:50.495]  It was designed to degrade the country and dispirit the rest of us.
[01:20:51.355 --> 01:20:52.656]  That's the White House Press Secretary?
[01:20:52.736 --> 01:20:53.136]  Shut up!
[01:20:54.246 --> 01:21:01.288]  But here's the thing, the White House press secretary herself has no idea why she's in the job.
[01:21:02.068 --> 01:21:03.248]  She thinks she's amazing.
[01:21:04.209 --> 01:21:05.849]  Here she is in a clip we just saw.
[01:21:06.749 --> 01:21:11.971]  A year in this role, there's been a couple of things that has made me incredibly proud.
[01:21:12.331 --> 01:21:17.692]  Many things, many things that made me incredibly proud to be at that podium during this historic moment.
[01:21:17.932 --> 01:21:19.593]  Again, this is a historic administration.
[01:21:20.033 --> 01:21:23.314]  I'm a historic figure and I certainly walk in history every day.
[01:21:24.463 --> 01:21:25.864]  I'm a historic figure?
[01:21:25.884 --> 01:21:28.846]  Imagine saying that!
[01:21:29.646 --> 01:21:31.467]  I'm a historic figure, but she does.
[01:21:32.528 --> 01:21:38.572]  And she says it in a burst of sincere self-congratulation, marked by her signature bad grammar.
[01:21:38.732 --> 01:21:40.293]  Illiterate, but proud!
[01:21:41.453 --> 01:21:42.334]  Of course she's proud.
[01:21:42.614 --> 01:21:49.318]  Karine Jean-Pierre is now a historic figure, just like Hunter Biden is now an important artist.
[01:21:50.499 --> 01:21:52.280]  It makes you feel stupid for going to work.
[01:21:55.613 --> 01:22:03.395]  Younger people say the news is full of lies.
[01:22:06.756 --> 01:22:16.459]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroyer now taking the helm of the mothership here, the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[01:22:16.519 --> 01:22:17.720]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:20.961]  Honored to be here.
[01:22:24.462 --> 01:22:24.602]  And...
[01:22:25.936 --> 01:22:29.558]  Guys, are we skipping all the breaks, or is this the last break we're skipping?
[01:22:30.479 --> 01:22:31.119]  Okay, thank you.
[01:22:31.179 --> 01:22:34.441]  We're actually about to come back from the break, right guys?
[01:22:34.561 --> 01:22:36.182]  Is my clock counting me down right there?
[01:22:36.202 --> 01:22:40.065]  So we're going to hit the reset button here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:22:40.085 --> 01:22:45.828]  I'm going to tell you everything we have coming up once our syndicated audience joins me in five seconds.
[01:22:46.488 --> 01:22:50.351]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer here taking over the Alex Jones Show.
[01:22:51.238 --> 01:22:58.024]  And we are live from the InfoWars World Headquarters here in Austin, Texas, and we've got so much news.
[01:22:58.324 --> 01:23:00.546]  It's really, my head is spinning today.
[01:23:01.086 --> 01:23:27.604]   We just really are dealing with the Hunter Biden situation now, and then we get the Durham testimony today in front of the House Judiciary Committee, which was filled with so much when it comes to The lies of Russian collusion, and when it comes to... I mean, I guess Durham won't say it.
[01:23:28.585 --> 01:23:30.065]  The crimes committed?
[01:23:33.165 --> 01:23:38.066]  So that Trump would be spied on and implicated in the false Russian collusion hoax?
[01:23:41.287 --> 01:23:54.068]   But you know, aside from what happened or didn't happen, what is truly incredible to witness Putting aside that... Well, to us it's clear what happened.
[01:23:54.929 --> 01:23:58.151]  Putting all that aside, it's a pretty incredible moment.
[01:23:58.211 --> 01:24:00.653]  It's a pretty incredible thing to witness.
[01:24:02.895 --> 01:24:03.855]  This polarization.
[01:24:05.817 --> 01:24:17.545]  Where you have Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell up there using the Durham hearing today as another opportunity to push Trump-Russia collusion.
[01:24:17.605 --> 01:24:18.586]  And that's what they did.
[01:24:19.187 --> 01:24:29.030]  The whole hearing is about how Trump-Russia collusion was a hoax that was used to spy illegally on Donald Trump and his campaign.
[01:24:30.270 --> 01:24:31.911]  That's the whole point of the hearing.
[01:24:32.431 --> 01:24:34.111]  That's what Durham was investigating.
[01:24:34.491 --> 01:24:35.612]  That's what he found.
[01:24:36.092 --> 01:24:37.472]  That's what he testified to.
[01:24:38.333 --> 01:24:43.834]  And then Schiff and Swalwell get up there and act like the whole thing is proof of Trump-Russia collusion.
[01:24:45.695 --> 01:24:46.415]  It's stunning!
[01:24:48.402 --> 01:24:54.207]  And Durham pretty much, I mean, he had some moments of saber-rattling, but he pretty much just took it.
[01:24:55.028 --> 01:24:56.069]  And I mean, what are you going to do?
[01:24:56.669 --> 01:24:58.711]  The Republicans let them sit there and lie.
[01:25:00.413 --> 01:25:01.514]  And this is the problem.
[01:25:03.455 --> 01:25:07.599]  Now, guys, tell me the latest as far as the vote to censure Adam Schiff.
[01:25:07.779 --> 01:25:09.381]  I think that might be coming up here shortly.
[01:25:09.681 --> 01:25:13.604]  Guys, bring me some news on the vote to censure Adam Schiff and let's monitor that.
[01:25:14.085 --> 01:25:28.897]   And then I don't know if the Durham hearing is still going or not, but this is why the weak leadership at the top of the Republican Party has to change, because this should not be happening, folks.
[01:25:30.318 --> 01:25:32.319]  And I don't want to be doom and gloom today.
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:42.985]  I'm going to try my best not to be doom and gloom today, even though I got a pretty good idea what's going on behind the scenes, and it's bad.
[01:25:43.065 --> 01:25:43.385]  I mean, it's...
[01:25:44.585 --> 01:25:47.607]  I mean, if I'm being honest, I'm probably telling you, you need to get the hell out of the country.
[01:25:49.648 --> 01:25:49.808]  Yeah.
[01:25:51.829 --> 01:25:53.029]  I mean, let's just be perfectly honest.
[01:25:53.690 --> 01:26:03.455]  If you didn't love this country, and you didn't have a family here, and you didn't actually believe in the idea that is America that made this the greatest country on Earth, and everybody want to come here, then you wouldn't be here.
[01:26:04.496 --> 01:26:05.076]  You'd be gone.
[01:26:07.421 --> 01:26:19.227]  Because when you've got political corruption at this level, at this high of a level, and then when you've got liars at this high of a level so committed to the lie... Folks, this is dangerous.
[01:26:20.287 --> 01:26:22.228]  I mean, it was barely even a news story.
[01:26:22.408 --> 01:26:23.549]  I don't even know if InfoWars covered it.
[01:26:25.650 --> 01:26:32.962]   That last week it came out that the FBI, and this vote is coming up too, So the vote to censor Adam Schiff is tonight.
[01:26:33.002 --> 01:26:33.723]  I'll come back to that.
[01:26:33.763 --> 01:26:35.664]  Guys, print me a story on that because I need to remember to cover this.
[01:26:36.004 --> 01:26:38.666]  The vote to censor Adam Schiff is tonight.
[01:26:39.066 --> 01:26:52.755]  There's another bill coming up to re-establish the FBI spy grid where they got caught last week illegally spying on hundreds of thousands of Americans.
[01:26:53.156 --> 01:26:54.777]  And they just say, oh, it was an accident.
[01:26:56.404 --> 01:27:06.804]   And they want Congress to reassert the FBI, the FBI's ability to go to six degrees of
[01:27:06.804 --> 01:27:11.923]  separation from any potential target.
[01:27:11.923 --> 01:27:21.004]   Now, I don't know what class they would teach you this in, but the six degree of separation
[01:27:21.004 --> 01:27:25.603]   rule is basically that everybody is within six degrees of separation from somebody else.
[01:27:25.841 --> 01:27:44.435]  In other words, you take one person in your friend group, and then you take their friend group, that's, their friend group is the second degree, and then everybody they know is the third degree, and then everybody they know is the fourth degree, and then everybody they know is the fifth degree, and then everybody they know is the sixth degree, and then eventually you're pretty much connected to everybody.
[01:27:44.855 --> 01:27:51.435]   And so the FBI, What should we go to six degrees of separation from their target?
[01:27:52.677 --> 01:28:03.517]   So if they're targeting Owen Schroyer, let's say, hypothetically speaking, now if I've texted my Mother?
[01:28:03.697 --> 01:28:04.558]  They can go for my mother.
[01:28:04.598 --> 01:28:07.059]  If my mother has texted her neighbor, they can go to my neighbor.
[01:28:07.379 --> 01:28:11.222]  If the neighbor has texted the person down the street, they can go to the person down the street.
[01:28:11.242 --> 01:28:14.704]  The person down the street texted their cousin in Wyoming, they can go to the person in Wyoming.
[01:28:15.024 --> 01:28:18.406]  Person in Wyoming texting the farmer down in Colorado, they can go to the farmer in Colorado.
[01:28:21.107 --> 01:28:22.508]  Barely even a blip on the radar, see?
[01:28:22.548 --> 01:28:25.810]  And so that's my point, but let's get back to the issue of Republican leadership.
[01:28:26.564 --> 01:28:33.827]  Because I'm not trying to be doom and gloom, I'm just telling you that we, the corruption of this country, folks, it, I mean, really, survival instincts, get the hell out.
[01:28:35.808 --> 01:28:37.369]  Maybe someday it's safe to come back.
[01:28:38.389 --> 01:28:45.312]  And I get it, you can still go out and enjoy a steak dinner, and you can still go out and enjoy a ball game and a concert, and that's fine, and we might be able to for another couple years or so.
[01:28:48.334 --> 01:28:56.635]   But, slowly but surely, as freedom erodes, as the economy The roads.
[01:28:58.357 --> 01:28:59.377]  It's not going to be so easy.
[01:28:59.397 --> 01:29:00.378]  It's not going to be so fun.
[01:29:01.499 --> 01:29:07.003]  And then the political corruption and persecution sits in and it just accelerates from there.
[01:29:09.264 --> 01:29:09.745]  It's not good.
[01:29:11.146 --> 01:29:11.626]  It's not good.
[01:29:13.607 --> 01:29:15.809]  And if only you knew how bad it was.
[01:29:15.929 --> 01:29:28.829]   And so this is why the juxtaposition of what happened yesterday with Hunter Biden and then what's happening today during the Durham hearing Just really has me realizing how dark and twisted and corrupt DC really is.
[01:29:28.949 --> 01:29:30.431]  I mean, it's bad.
[01:29:31.732 --> 01:29:37.801]  And I get Brett Baier wanting to do a good job with the Trump interview and coming off as non-partisan in that interview.
[01:29:38.021 --> 01:29:39.062]  I get it, that's fine.
[01:29:40.304 --> 01:29:41.446]  That's fine, but it's like...
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:46.461]  Brett, you know, like, you know the country is occupied.
[01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:49.962]  It's like, you know there's a double standard of justice.
[01:29:50.002 --> 01:29:52.623]  Like, you know the government's weaponized against any dissent.
[01:29:52.663 --> 01:29:54.124]  Like, you know that, Brett.
[01:29:55.104 --> 01:29:59.685]  I get that you're a journalist and you want to do a professional interview with Donald Trump and you want to do a good job.
[01:29:59.946 --> 01:30:00.426]  And you did.
[01:30:00.846 --> 01:30:03.147]  But it's like, you're living in the country too.
[01:30:03.407 --> 01:30:05.487]  It's like, they're destroying your country too.
[01:30:05.928 --> 01:30:08.868]  You might have millions of dollars, it won't matter in five years.
[01:30:09.309 --> 01:30:10.109]  If this continues.
[01:30:11.762 --> 01:30:13.762]  They'll come after you too.
[01:30:13.762 --> 01:30:22.882]   So we're going to hone in on the more details from the Hunter Biden situation
[01:30:22.882 --> 01:30:27.842]  and we're going to talk about the hearing today with Durham.
[01:30:28.066 --> 01:30:33.247]  And by the way, just for programming notice, stick with us all day today at Banned Out Video.
[01:30:33.527 --> 01:30:50.030]   I've got a lawyer joining me first hour of the war room to respond to the Hunter Biden charges, plea deal, and then I've got An individual, who you may know, Ivan Reikland, who was at the Durham hearing today, he's joining me at four in the war room, so we're going to dig even deeper into these things.
[01:30:50.410 --> 01:31:01.057]  And the juxtaposition of these two stories, the two-tiered system of justice, and the Democrats using the Durham hearing today to promote their fake Russian collusion narrative again, which tells me they're going to bring it back up.
[01:31:01.892 --> 01:31:04.155]  They're not done faking Russian collusion with Donald Trump.
[01:31:04.175 --> 01:31:06.158]  They're gonna bring it back up for the 2024 election.
[01:31:06.839 --> 01:31:07.299]  Guaranteed.
[01:31:07.439 --> 01:31:11.044]  I mean, seal it in gold, etch it into the side of the mountain, like, it's done.
[01:31:11.324 --> 01:31:13.367]  Trump-Russia collusion's coming back for 2024.
[01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:14.589]  Democrat Party.
[01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:17.413]  Here's why Republican leadership...
[01:31:18.246 --> 01:31:25.709]  Has made a massive failure, and I mean just asleep at the wheel, asleep at the switch, not even on the playing field.
[01:31:25.789 --> 01:31:29.431]  Ronald McDaniel, Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy have failed miserably.
[01:31:29.451 --> 01:31:33.232]  I mean, Kevin McCarthy, I'll give him credit, he shows that he has signs of life every once in a while.
[01:31:33.513 --> 01:31:36.474]  McConnell and McDaniel, completely worthless.
[01:31:37.174 --> 01:31:38.635]  They're 0-4 all season.
[01:31:38.675 --> 01:31:40.736]  They have not gotten a single hit all season.
[01:31:40.996 --> 01:31:42.877]  Kevin McCartney's put a couple balls in play.
[01:31:43.137 --> 01:31:44.538]  He's gotten on base a couple times.
[01:31:44.778 --> 01:31:45.838]  He's scored a couple runs.
[01:31:46.379 --> 01:31:49.460]  Still probably your ninth hitter, but he's at least making some plays.
[01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:52.402]  McConnell and McDaniel are 0-4 all season.
[01:31:53.782 --> 01:31:59.205]  Why was Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, but let's focus on Schiff because the vote's at hand tonight.
[01:32:00.507 --> 01:32:08.252]  Why is Adam Schiff even on that committee today to sabotage the Durham hearing?
[01:32:09.413 --> 01:32:12.255]  He should not have even been there.
[01:32:12.595 --> 01:32:13.476]  Why was he there?
[01:32:13.796 --> 01:32:15.837]  Because there's no Republican leadership.
[01:32:17.158 --> 01:32:17.959]  Now you watch.
[01:32:19.079 --> 01:32:21.021]  Tonight's vote to censor Adam Schiff.
[01:32:21.781 --> 01:32:23.042]  Censure Adam Schiff.
[01:32:24.003 --> 01:32:24.483]  I'm not sure.
[01:32:24.503 --> 01:32:25.423]  It's a pretty rare thing.
[01:32:25.504 --> 01:32:27.325]  Not too many members of Congress have been censured like this.
[01:32:29.127 --> 01:32:33.295]  Tonight's vote to censure Adam Schiff will pass.
[01:32:34.577 --> 01:32:35.178]  It will pass.
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:40.788]  Should have passed last week, but it didn't because of Republican leadership failing us.
[01:32:43.086 --> 01:32:51.691]  They should have come together and they should have said, if we're gonna vote to censor Adam Schiff, here's what needs to be in it, and if this is not what it is, I'm not voting.
[01:32:51.912 --> 01:32:55.754]  Well, they tried to do it anyway, and I don't blame Anna Paulina Luna.
[01:32:56.034 --> 01:32:57.595]  Nobody's organizing all of this.
[01:32:58.096 --> 01:32:59.657]  She's not the leadership of the Republican Party.
[01:32:59.697 --> 01:33:00.497]  She's doing her job.
[01:33:00.557 --> 01:33:02.078]  She's trying to put together a censure vote.
[01:33:02.118 --> 01:33:02.618]  She does it.
[01:33:02.899 --> 01:33:09.623]  The Republicans weren't organized, and now Adam Schiff sat on the committee today and sabotaged the entire Durham hearing.
[01:33:11.343 --> 01:33:12.384]  We're gonna get more into this.
[01:33:13.104 --> 01:33:16.027]  Third hour of the Alex Jones Show is upon us.
[01:33:16.047 --> 01:33:31.578]  I mean, there's so many things that have me tormented over the status of our country, the country we love so much, that we want to see, we want to continue to see, be the beacon of light and hope on the planet for freedom.
[01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:38.203]  But there's just so many things that have me really, really concerned, folks.
[01:33:38.463 --> 01:33:43.238]   So concerned at survival instincts, I mean, I'm not saying I'm fleeing the country.
[01:33:43.258 --> 01:33:49.368]  I'm saying if I wasn't me, I'd be sitting there and thinking survival instincts.
[01:33:49.869 --> 01:33:51.772]  This country is so corrupt, it's dangerous.
[01:33:53.215 --> 01:33:54.257]  I mean, it's dangerous, folks.
[01:33:55.546 --> 01:34:05.756]  Joe Biden being bought and paid for by Chinese and his son, a crackhead doing international business deals, and then they get favorable treatment from the Justice Department.
[01:34:05.796 --> 01:34:07.998]  I mean, folks, this is... I get it.
[01:34:08.058 --> 01:34:09.059]  We're Americans.
[01:34:09.099 --> 01:34:09.960]  We're prosperous.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:10.500]  We're gritty.
[01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:12.862]  We don't really want to think or deal with our government.
[01:34:13.843 --> 01:34:15.445]  I mean, it's all here.
[01:34:16.755 --> 01:34:25.762]  Don't forget we've got a wide open southern border where there's major issues and you had Chip Roy just going off on the Democrats on this.
[01:34:25.802 --> 01:34:26.782]  So many epic clips.
[01:34:26.842 --> 01:34:34.548]  We're just going to roll some of them right here for you and we will rejoin and dig into more of the clips from the Durham hearing on the other side.
[01:34:35.829 --> 01:34:43.014]  We get a new piece of news every single day of some other event of something that's occurred in Texas.
[01:34:45.796 --> 01:34:55.784]  We have on Friday, Texas troopers stopped an illegal alien from Mexico possessing handgun and cocaine while smuggling a dozen other illegals in Uvalde County bound for San Antonio.
[01:34:56.565 --> 01:35:00.248]  I could list off hundreds of examples I get on a regular basis.
[01:35:00.308 --> 01:35:07.094]  My phone is lighting up every week from sheriffs and people in Texas dealing with this all the time.
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:16.146]  Schools that have to put the big blocks up to deal with bailouts and trucks and people going across the properties, ranches, fences cut, livestock out, all the stuff.
[01:35:16.226 --> 01:35:17.287]  It's not fake, it's real.
[01:35:17.367 --> 01:35:19.169]  It's literally happening every day.
[01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:23.332]  My phone, pictures, I get pictures every day from Texans dealing with it.
[01:35:24.653 --> 01:35:27.075]  I mean, at some point, Texas is going to say screw it, enough.
[01:35:27.095 --> 01:35:29.417]  We're going to do whatever the hell we want to do.
[01:35:31.238 --> 01:35:32.379]  And I'll be an advocate for that.
[01:35:35.626 --> 01:35:38.507]  Because the people in this Congress are ignoring the people of Texas.
[01:35:39.347 --> 01:35:41.428]  And by the way, the migrants getting abused.
[01:35:42.189 --> 01:35:42.809]  That's the truth.
[01:35:44.129 --> 01:35:46.610]  Talking about people who are admitted into this country.
[01:35:46.630 --> 01:35:49.691]  We're talking about the legal definition of admission.
[01:35:50.572 --> 01:36:03.377]  Not the one app where you're processing people through a port of entry and just dumping them in the United States without having any idea when they return for a hearing on whether their asylum claim was legitimate in the first place, which it usually is not.
[01:36:04.721 --> 01:36:05.482]  That's the truth.
[01:36:06.643 --> 01:36:07.965]  Now you can shake your head all you want.
[01:36:08.065 --> 01:36:10.588]  We're the ones holding the goddamn bag in Texas.
[01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:12.310]  It's true.
[01:36:14.172 --> 01:36:15.874]  Talk to the dead people in Texas.
[01:36:17.035 --> 01:36:17.917]  Yeah, good, walk out.
[01:36:17.957 --> 01:36:18.818]  You don't like the rants?
[01:36:19.218 --> 01:36:24.544]  We don't like what's happening to Texas because of you and the president down the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.
[01:36:25.325 --> 01:36:25.946]  That's the truth!
[01:36:25.966 --> 01:36:32.371]  Mr. Chair, the gentlelady from Minnesota made her issue about not getting personal.
[01:36:32.992 --> 01:36:37.956]  I would urge the chair to... Alright, I'll retract the you to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.
[01:36:38.016 --> 01:36:39.477]  And by the way, this is a small committee room.
[01:36:39.537 --> 01:36:40.358]  We don't have to scream.
[01:36:40.638 --> 01:36:46.583]  Look, the fact of the matter is I have people dying in my state as a direct consequence of what this federal government fails to do.
[01:36:48.805 --> 01:36:51.588]  Kids in my district dying from fentanyl pouring into the community.
[01:36:52.529 --> 01:37:01.295]  Schools overrun, hospitals overrun, people trying to figure out how to deal with what is happening because the federal government refuses to do its basic duty.
[01:37:03.196 --> 01:37:04.256]  You want to talk about the migrants?
[01:37:05.657 --> 01:37:08.719]  You want to talk about the stash house in Fort Worth that I mentioned last week?
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:27.931]   Where a federal judge is talking about the extent to which the man sitting in Baltimore was paying $1,000 to have his wife and daughter sent up, but he was being held Hostage to $23,000 while his wife and daughter and the guy in the stash house is saying, I'm going to rape your daughter.
[01:37:29.172 --> 01:37:31.593]  And that's what the guy's being told right up here in Baltimore.
[01:37:32.374 --> 01:37:37.397]  And that's in a federal filing by a federal judge talking about these are the facts.
[01:37:37.417 --> 01:37:39.038]  This is what we're talking about every single day.
[01:37:39.078 --> 01:37:45.783]  You have federal judges now moving stuff up and saying we have to upward depart from the actual sentencing guidelines.
[01:37:48.746 --> 01:37:54.107]  Sit down and talk to the people and the sheriffs in South Texas who are having to deal with this every day and it's absolute chaos.
[01:37:54.567 --> 01:37:55.707]  Chip Roy actually cares.
[01:37:57.227 --> 01:38:00.128]  And then you have these other members of the committee.
[01:38:00.168 --> 01:38:01.048]  Chip, this is a small room.
[01:38:01.068 --> 01:38:01.648]  You don't have to yell.
[01:38:02.228 --> 01:38:03.629]  He cares, folks.
[01:38:03.809 --> 01:38:04.889]  He cares about the country.
[01:38:05.229 --> 01:38:06.649]  I'm sorry you don't care about the country.
[01:38:06.669 --> 01:38:07.029]  I'm sorry.
[01:38:07.209 --> 01:38:08.489]  Yeah, I'm raising my voice right now.
[01:38:08.529 --> 01:38:08.889]  I'm sorry.
[01:38:08.909 --> 01:38:09.210]  You're right.
[01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:10.770]  The country's being invaded.
[01:38:11.170 --> 01:38:12.030]  Why should I care?
[01:38:12.730 --> 01:38:20.799]   You know, it's really time we ask ourselves some difficult questions like, What is broken in this country?
[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:35.948]  The mind of the liberal, the border, our constitutional system and political science, the American media, these are things that are broken.
[01:38:35.968 --> 01:38:41.631]  And then you ask yourself, okay, well, what do we want to fix, and how do we want to fix it, and is it even possible to fix?
[01:38:43.192 --> 01:38:47.655]  And then you have to start making some tough decisions about what you're going to do.
[01:38:49.565 --> 01:38:53.388]  Because this, it's not just political corruption, folks.
[01:38:57.171 --> 01:39:00.093]  Project Veritas, or excuse me, I'm sorry, not Project Veritas.
[01:39:00.834 --> 01:39:02.615]  James O'Keefe with O'Keefe Media Group.
[01:39:02.635 --> 01:39:03.616]  Let me correct myself.
[01:39:03.856 --> 01:39:04.797]  Excuse me.
[01:39:05.638 --> 01:39:18.028]  James O'Keefe, O'Keefe Media Group, drops a video yesterday where BlackRock recruiter is bragging about how they buy and sell politicians, world governments, and basically own everything.
[01:39:19.179 --> 01:39:20.600]  Barely even a story.
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:20.980]  Why?
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.140]  Because we all know it!
[01:39:25.642 --> 01:39:26.782]  And nothing changes.
[01:39:28.303 --> 01:39:29.384]  Our system is broken.
[01:39:29.424 --> 01:39:32.385]  Trump slams Hunter Biden's sweetheart deal as election interference.
[01:39:32.505 --> 01:39:32.965]  Absolutely.
[01:39:32.985 --> 01:39:34.246]  The whole thing is election interference.
[01:39:35.726 --> 01:39:36.767]  But they're leftists.
[01:39:36.867 --> 01:39:37.827]  They're authoritarians.
[01:39:38.007 --> 01:39:39.668]  They're the bad guys.
[01:39:40.588 --> 01:39:43.670]  They do bad things until they're put behind bars.
[01:39:45.287 --> 01:39:49.269]  But meanwhile, Trump is going to be in court in August.
[01:39:49.989 --> 01:39:52.410]  And I'm trying to better understand this through all the noise.
[01:39:52.510 --> 01:39:55.851]  Judge Cannon sets Trump trial for August, but it's not likely to stick.
[01:39:56.851 --> 01:40:02.554]  Well, Florida takes speedy trial rights very seriously, and I guess Trump's not waiving that.
[01:40:02.854 --> 01:40:05.835]  So, I mean, 70 days is the maximum.
[01:40:07.255 --> 01:40:09.576]  Till August 14th is the longest they can push it back.
[01:40:09.916 --> 01:40:12.937]  Unless Trump says he's gonna waive his speedy trial rights.
[01:40:13.138 --> 01:40:13.718]  I haven't heard that.
[01:40:14.690 --> 01:40:15.771]  And I'm not sure why he would.
[01:40:15.791 --> 01:40:20.674]  And I mean that whole situation gets more ridiculous with the documents.
[01:40:20.954 --> 01:40:21.915]  Was Trump set up?
[01:40:25.337 --> 01:40:26.337]  Of course it's a double standard.
[01:40:26.678 --> 01:40:30.480]  And then the story from Larry Johnson at the Gateway Pundit.
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:33.082]  Biden and America have a major China problem.
[01:40:33.422 --> 01:40:34.823]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:40:39.198 --> 01:40:44.902]  And I'm supposed to believe that Hunter Biden... You know, nobody enjoyed Trump's America more than Hunter Biden.
[01:40:44.922 --> 01:40:47.384]  I mean, let's just call it like it is.
[01:40:48.064 --> 01:40:52.948]  Nobody was having more fun in Donald Trump's presidency than Hunter Biden.
[01:40:53.688 --> 01:40:58.211]  Running around, doing drugs with hookers and God knows what else, taking pictures of himself with little girls.
[01:41:00.793 --> 01:41:01.934]  Does Hunter Biden have a foot fetish?
[01:41:04.015 --> 01:41:04.876]  Or is it something else?
[01:41:07.196 --> 01:41:15.081]  I'm supposed to believe that Hunter Biden was just having so much fun, addicted to crack, running around doing business deals for his dad, 10% for the big guy.
[01:41:15.101 --> 01:41:21.044]  I mean, folks, Joe Biden was treating his son like a mule.
[01:41:23.005 --> 01:41:25.707]  Again, and it's just like, is Hunter Biden cooperating with the FBI?
[01:41:25.747 --> 01:41:26.888]  How does he get this sweetheart deal?
[01:41:26.928 --> 01:41:28.549]  Is it really just because his last name is Biden?
[01:41:28.569 --> 01:41:31.170]  Is that, I mean, I know it's that bad, but it's like, really?
[01:41:31.230 --> 01:41:33.852]  I have to swallow this pill again?
[01:41:37.242 --> 01:41:38.943]  Or was Hunter Biden really that sick of his dad?
[01:41:40.724 --> 01:41:42.826]  Taking 10%, sending him around the world.
[01:41:43.426 --> 01:41:44.627]  Taking 10% of the cut.
[01:41:45.287 --> 01:41:46.868]  Hunter Biden doing his dad's dirty work.
[01:41:48.409 --> 01:41:50.971]  Oh, Joe Biden says he loves his son so much.
[01:41:51.031 --> 01:41:51.331]  Really?
[01:41:51.611 --> 01:42:02.879]  Because you sent your son, who was addicted to crack and porn, around the planet to do international business deals for you.
[01:42:04.045 --> 01:42:04.866]  For you.
[01:42:04.886 --> 01:42:07.447]  Does that sound like somebody that loves their son?
[01:42:07.847 --> 01:42:10.389]  Yeah, my son's addicted to crack and addicted to sex.
[01:42:11.630 --> 01:42:14.912]  He's so bad he's sleeping with my son's widow.
[01:42:16.973 --> 01:42:20.915]  But I'm gonna send him around the world to do international business deals because I'm getting 10% of that cut.
[01:42:21.196 --> 01:42:22.737]  Sounds like you really love your son, Joe.
[01:42:24.318 --> 01:42:26.339]  And the media just lops it all up.
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:33.675]   And then today, At the Durham hearing.
[01:42:33.715 --> 01:42:35.557]  Now we're going to start going to some of these clips.
[01:42:37.358 --> 01:42:43.043]  But it really is unfortunate the lack of Republican leadership that Adam Schiff was allowed to sabotage this hearing today.
[01:42:43.183 --> 01:42:43.944]  It shouldn't have happened.
[01:42:43.984 --> 01:42:46.686]  He's going to get the vote to censure him is going to pass tonight.
[01:42:49.308 --> 01:42:51.570]  And I believe they can even remove him from that committee.
[01:42:51.610 --> 01:42:53.331]  I don't know how he's still on that committee.
[01:42:53.851 --> 01:42:57.875]  A man who lied about evidence of Trump-Russia collusion still hasn't presented it to this day.
[01:42:58.655 --> 01:42:59.396]  And it's just sick.
[01:43:01.641 --> 01:43:06.104]  Again, even from a neutral... Just put yourself from a neutral standpoint.
[01:43:06.625 --> 01:43:07.886]  You listen to that hearing today.
[01:43:08.446 --> 01:43:13.630]  The Democrats on the Judiciary Committee believe that the Mueller report proved Trump-Russia collusion.
[01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:16.272]  They claim that and believe that!
[01:43:17.073 --> 01:43:17.993]  And repeated that!
[01:43:18.734 --> 01:43:19.515]  All day today!
[01:43:20.355 --> 01:43:21.076]  It didn't!
[01:43:22.937 --> 01:43:23.718]  It didn't!
[01:43:24.078 --> 01:43:26.660]  And even Mueller in his testimony said it didn't!
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:32.580]   And the Democrats still go up there and say, the Mueller probe Proved Trump-Russia collusion!
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:35.442]  And then Durham just sits up there and nods his head!
[01:43:36.723 --> 01:43:37.464]  What the hell?!
[01:43:40.246 --> 01:43:49.372]  And then you hear the Republicans, so they're like, well, now that we know that the whole Trump-Russia collusion thing was a hoax brought to you by the Clinton campaign and Barack Obama, which it was!
[01:43:49.753 --> 01:43:52.335]  That's what the entire Durham report was all about!
[01:43:53.615 --> 01:43:59.680]  But then it's like, oh, Trump-Russia collusion was real, even though this whole hearing about how it was fake, and this is the guy that investigated it.
[01:44:00.956 --> 01:44:02.517]  What kind of Twilight Zone?
[01:44:03.797 --> 01:44:05.037]  You watch this stuff again, folks.
[01:44:05.057 --> 01:44:10.759]  That's what I'm saying, like... You're not in the Twilight Zone!
[01:44:10.799 --> 01:44:11.820]  This is your life!
[01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:12.980]  This is our country!
[01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:14.160]  This is the real thing!
[01:44:17.762 --> 01:44:21.003]  They had some really good actors, didn't they?
[01:44:21.483 --> 01:44:24.224]  In the Twilight Zone, that sold you the fear!
[01:44:26.553 --> 01:44:30.258]  That sold you the confusion of being in the twilight zone.
[01:44:30.578 --> 01:44:31.319]  You're in it!
[01:44:33.842 --> 01:44:35.404]  You're in the twilight zone!
[01:44:37.727 --> 01:44:45.397]  Let's start with Jim Jordan presses Durham on Hillary's plan to tie Trump to Russia here in clip two.
[01:44:49.262 --> 01:44:57.128]  Mr. Durham, in the summer of 2016, did our government receive intelligence that suggested Secretary Clinton had approved a plan to tie President Trump to Russia?
[01:44:57.648 --> 01:44:57.848]  Yes.
[01:44:58.428 --> 01:45:07.695]  Was that intelligence important enough for Director Brennan to go brief the President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States, the Attorney General of the United States, and the Director of the FBI?
[01:45:08.195 --> 01:45:08.395]  Yes.
[01:45:08.795 --> 01:45:12.378]  And was that intelligence put then into a memorandum, a referral memorandum?
[01:45:12.838 --> 01:45:13.058]  Yes.
[01:45:13.418 --> 01:45:16.881]  And was that memorandum then given to Director Comey and Agent Strzok?
[01:45:17.691 --> 01:45:18.852]  That's who it was addressed to, yes.
[01:45:19.992 --> 01:45:22.554]  Did Director Comey share that memorandum with the FISA court?
[01:45:23.174 --> 01:45:23.635]  I'm sorry, can you?
[01:45:23.655 --> 01:45:25.796]  Did he share that memorandum with the FISA court?
[01:45:25.816 --> 01:45:26.776]  Did Director Comey do that?
[01:45:28.017 --> 01:45:29.158]  I'm not aware of that, if he did.
[01:45:29.278 --> 01:45:32.660]  Did he share it with the lawyers preparing the FISA application?
[01:45:33.761 --> 01:45:34.501]  Not to my knowledge.
[01:45:34.561 --> 01:45:38.763]  Did he share it with the agents on the case working the Crossfire Hurricane case?
[01:45:39.184 --> 01:45:39.284]  No.
[01:45:39.926 --> 01:45:41.148]  Didn't share with the agents on the case.
[01:45:41.168 --> 01:45:49.742]  Can you tell the committee what happened when you took that referral memo and shared it with one of those agents, specifically Supervisory Special Agent Number One?
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:59.184]  We interviewed the first supervisor of the crossfire investigation, the operational person.
[01:46:00.205 --> 01:46:03.246]  We showed him the intelligence information.
[01:46:03.266 --> 01:46:05.468]  He indicated he had never seen it before.
[01:46:05.488 --> 01:46:11.211]  He immediately became emotional and got up and left the room with his lawyer.
[01:46:12.932 --> 01:46:14.934]  Spent some time in the hallway, came back.
[01:46:15.514 --> 01:46:17.776]  He was ticked off, wasn't he?
[01:46:17.796 --> 01:46:21.099]  He was ticked off because this is something he should have had as an agent on the case.
[01:46:21.119 --> 01:46:26.824]  This is important information that the director of the FBI kept from the people doing the investigation.
[01:46:27.145 --> 01:46:28.386]  The information was kept from him.
[01:46:29.747 --> 01:46:32.209]  So, folks, where is the outrage?
[01:46:34.731 --> 01:46:38.555]  Where's the legitimate righteous indignation here?
[01:46:41.946 --> 01:46:45.868]  So imagine you're this FBI agent, if you believe the testimony here.
[01:46:47.549 --> 01:46:48.910]  You're a stand-up FBI agent.
[01:46:48.990 --> 01:47:13.494]   You just want to do your job, and somebody says, we need you to investigate Individual A, because we believe there is a Russian collusion Activity here that we need we need to investigate and use and they say okay, you have evidence and they say yes Dossier is okay.
[01:47:13.514 --> 01:47:37.915]   I'll go investigate and then you find out that they actually had evidence that the dossier was fake and they knew it and they withheld that from you and sent you on a politically incentivized witch hunt Has that FBI agent gone to the House Oversight Committee has that FBI agent become a whistleblower for Republicans in the house Has his lawyer said anything to the public?
[01:47:39.198 --> 01:47:40.660]  Seems like kind of a big story.
[01:47:41.482 --> 01:47:43.144]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones Show.

[01:49:04.071 --> 01:49:16.579]   So, the whole Durham report Is about how they knew the Trump-Russia collusion evidence, so-called dossier, was fake.
[01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:21.782]  And then they did the spying and investigation into Donald Trump anyway, even though they knew it was fake.
[01:49:22.063 --> 01:49:33.750]  And they withheld that information from other special agents in the field because they knew they couldn't get them to go do this illegal criminal activity if they knew that the evidence they had was completely fake.
[01:49:35.290 --> 01:49:40.697]  And yet somehow the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee heard something else.
[01:49:41.979 --> 01:49:43.461]  It's like we're living in different worlds.
[01:49:43.841 --> 01:49:48.808]  Here's Durham talking about the seriousness of the findings in clip three.
[01:49:51.191 --> 01:49:52.393]  Our findings were sobering.
[01:49:53.422 --> 01:49:58.824]  I can tell you, having spent 40 years plus as a federal prosecutor, they were particularly sobering to me.
[01:49:58.844 --> 01:50:05.505]  A number of my colleagues who spent decades in the FBI themselves, they were sobering.
[01:50:06.426 --> 01:50:27.738]   While I'm encouraged by some of the reforms that have been implemented by the FBI, the problems identified in this report, anybody who actually reads the report, the details of the report, the documented portions of the report, I think would find that The problems identified in the report are not susceptible to overnight fixes.
[01:50:28.759 --> 01:50:35.143]  As we said in the report, they cannot be addressed solely by enhancing training or additional policy requirements.
[01:50:35.984 --> 01:50:50.713]  Rather, what is required is accountability, both in terms of the standards to which our law enforcement personnel hold themselves and in the consequences they face for violation of laws and policies of relevance.
[01:50:51.194 --> 01:50:52.395]  Our findings were sobering.
[01:50:53.502 --> 01:50:58.688]  Until you having spent four years... Alright, let's now go to... Yeah, sobering, uh, the corruption.
[01:50:58.769 --> 01:51:00.551]  It's... Sobering is one word.
[01:51:01.412 --> 01:51:03.014]  How about absolutely terrifying?
[01:51:04.456 --> 01:51:06.017]  Probably the more accurate word.
[01:51:06.618 --> 01:51:11.384]  Here's Durham talking about FBI agents he's talked to since the investigation in Clip 23.
[01:51:12.954 --> 01:51:16.316]  Let me give you some real life views on that.
[01:51:16.976 --> 01:51:29.544]  I have had any number of FBI agents who I've worked with over the years, some of whom are retired, some are still in place, who have come to me and apologized for the manner in which that investigation was undertaken.
[01:51:29.624 --> 01:51:31.045]  I take that seriously.
[01:51:31.105 --> 01:51:34.747]  These are good, hardworking, majority of people in the FBI.
[01:51:35.827 --> 01:51:42.012]  Decent human beings who swear under their oaths to abide by the law and the like.
[01:51:42.252 --> 01:51:47.516]  And I think that typifies, exemplifies of the concern here.
[01:51:48.837 --> 01:52:00.306]  There were investigative activities undertaken or not undertaken here, which raised real concerns about whether or not the law was followed, the policies in place, the FBI were followed.
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:05.361]  You know, I don't want to sound demeaning here.
[01:52:06.542 --> 01:52:07.903]  That's not the intent.
[01:52:09.083 --> 01:52:12.705]  But you've really got to wonder, when is something going to give in all of this?
[01:52:13.205 --> 01:52:14.346]  Is everybody a coward?
[01:52:17.508 --> 01:52:33.369]   I think that that's been Donald Trump's biggest frustration, and he voices that perhaps in Very rugged ways, calling former members of his cabinet milquetoast, dumb as a rock, small brain, what have you.
[01:52:34.770 --> 01:52:36.811]  And really, I think it all just comes down to cowardice.
[01:52:36.831 --> 01:52:41.154]  It's like, you know all this corruption is going on, you don't want to say anything.
[01:52:44.977 --> 01:52:51.762]  How many people in DC, inside the FBI, know how bad it is, know how corrupt it is, and won't go public?
[01:52:56.457 --> 01:52:58.018]  Is it that they just don't see?
[01:52:58.058 --> 01:52:59.539]  They have no foresight at all?
[01:52:59.599 --> 01:53:00.800]  They can't see where it's going?
[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:02.141]  Are they really just that scared?
[01:53:02.181 --> 01:53:03.221]  Do they really not care?
[01:53:03.261 --> 01:53:07.604]  Is it just, oh, I don't wanna... The government's gonna destroy them if they say anything?
[01:53:07.964 --> 01:53:09.385]  Like the one FBI whistleblower said?
[01:53:13.188 --> 01:53:15.349]  You're just like, where are the men of courage?
[01:53:18.611 --> 01:53:24.215]  We've had some small handful of FBI agents go public.
[01:53:24.515 --> 01:53:25.516]  You saw them in the hearing.
[01:53:26.278 --> 01:53:28.799]  Others that have gone public, done media interviews.
[01:53:28.819 --> 01:53:30.080]  In fact, we've got a big one.
[01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:32.581]  I mean... Well, I'll just tell you.
[01:53:32.601 --> 01:53:34.522]  We've got a big FBI whistleblower coming in studio next week.
[01:53:35.343 --> 01:53:35.903]  How do you like that?
[01:53:36.163 --> 01:53:37.924]  We'll break some news for you right here.
[01:53:37.944 --> 01:53:39.625]  FBI whistleblower coming in studio next week.
[01:53:40.866 --> 01:53:41.306]  Is the plan.
[01:53:42.046 --> 01:53:43.447]  Still filing out the details.
[01:53:44.227 --> 01:53:46.228]  So it's like, where are all the brave men and women?
[01:53:47.209 --> 01:53:48.209]  Let's just leave it with the men.
[01:53:48.509 --> 01:53:49.770]  Where are all the brave men?
[01:53:50.651 --> 01:53:52.071]  You saw Chip Roy getting fired up.
[01:53:52.131 --> 01:53:53.412]  You see Jim Jordan taking him on.
[01:53:54.445 --> 01:54:05.328]  It's like, but where is, there should be an overwhelming flood of American men that know how bad it is standing up and saying, folks, we got a serious problem here.
[01:54:05.428 --> 01:54:11.069]  We're not going to have a country much longer if we don't do something.
[01:54:11.129 --> 01:54:14.710]  And it sounds like Durham is alluding to that with the FBI agents that have gone to him and apologized.
[01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:18.231]  Don't apologize to John Durham.
[01:54:20.132 --> 01:54:21.632]  Apologize to the American people.
[01:54:23.934 --> 01:54:26.996]  Go public and apologize to the American people!
[01:54:27.136 --> 01:54:29.136]  Not John Durham.
[01:54:29.136 --> 01:54:35.136]  Why won't they?
[01:54:35.136 --> 01:54:45.136]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:38.341]  By the way, again, where are the men of bravery?
[01:54:38.842 --> 01:54:43.404]  I guess they're women now, like Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene filing articles of impeachment.
[01:54:43.504 --> 01:54:45.585]  I'm gonna have that coming up for you, but one more thing here.
[01:54:47.313 --> 01:54:48.874]  Durham calling out Adam Schiff.
[01:54:48.894 --> 01:54:52.456]  There were a couple interesting exchanges between he and Schiff that make you wonder.
[01:54:52.816 --> 01:54:53.677]  Here's one of them in clip 22.
[01:54:53.717 --> 01:55:01.541]  This son of a presidential candidate gets calls all the time from a foreign government offering dirt on their important opponent.
[01:55:01.601 --> 01:55:02.221]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:55:02.321 --> 01:55:04.302]  I don't think this is unique in your experience.
[01:55:05.463 --> 01:55:12.567]  So you have other instances of the Russian government offering... What did Durham mean by that?
[01:55:14.228 --> 01:55:17.507]   There were other interesting little tidbits from Schiff and Durham.
[01:55:17.507 --> 01:55:27.108]  The fact that Adam Schiff even gets into Congress is such...
[01:55:27.108 --> 01:55:30.067]  I mean, that right there alone is like...
[01:55:30.067 --> 01:55:35.907]   The fire alarms are going off in your house, and smoke is pouring out of the door.
[01:55:35.907 --> 01:55:45.907]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:55:38.186 --> 01:55:41.148]  It's like, you got your houses on fire, Jack!
[01:55:42.998 --> 01:55:45.780]  But that's just Adam Schiff and Congress is like, your house is on fire.
[01:55:46.161 --> 01:55:49.984]  This is, the whole thing is a structure fire collapsing in all around us.
[01:55:50.644 --> 01:55:51.926]  The fire alarms aren't going off.
[01:55:52.266 --> 01:55:53.767]  They have completely melted.
[01:55:54.548 --> 01:55:57.310]  The firearms are now liquid goo.
[01:55:57.951 --> 01:55:59.652]  And the house is collapsing in all around us.
[01:55:59.752 --> 01:56:02.695]  It's like, we gotta bust out of this thing now, folks.
[01:56:02.775 --> 01:56:10.801]  I'm telling you, it's... Because with all the Biden corruption coming out and everything else, the tyranny is only going to intensify.
[01:56:11.735 --> 01:56:15.076]  They're only going to get more defensive, causing them to get more offensive against us.
[01:56:15.677 --> 01:56:19.458]  There's no doubt, America is worth saving.
[01:56:19.718 --> 01:56:23.360]  America is worth preserving and restoring.
[01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:26.001]  Absolutely, 100%, no doubt.
[01:56:26.061 --> 01:56:28.182]  Now, people might argue that, but to me, no.
[01:56:29.402 --> 01:56:30.823]  To rational-minded people, no.
[01:56:31.383 --> 01:56:32.704]  To realistic people, no.
[01:56:33.604 --> 01:56:35.665]  The question is, can it be saved?
[01:56:35.825 --> 01:56:36.906]  Can it be restored?
[01:56:37.506 --> 01:56:40.007]  Or have we just gone beyond the pale in the last four years?
[01:56:41.898 --> 01:56:55.249]  I mean, the good news is the left is so out of their minds, even if they do completely conquer this country and just completely destroy it, within ten years they'll fall apart and probably we could restore the republic after that.
[01:56:55.509 --> 01:57:07.299]  I mean, I was talking to a guy earlier today, I'm at my barbershop, this individual goes to a local university, local Christian university.
[01:57:08.482 --> 01:57:09.082]  And he was stunned.
[01:57:09.102 --> 01:57:14.366]  He was like, yeah, they brought a drag queen into my computer class.
[01:57:14.746 --> 01:57:17.868]  This guy's learning about computer data and coding.
[01:57:18.528 --> 01:57:22.610]  And they bring in a drag queen for Pride Month and tell you about how great it is.
[01:57:22.630 --> 01:57:32.705]   And a non-political person is like, oh, yeah, asking questions about Why you do this?
[01:57:32.785 --> 01:57:33.786]  Why you pretend to be a girl?
[01:57:33.846 --> 01:57:36.267]  And like, the whole class is like, oh my gosh, you bigot, what's wrong with you?
[01:57:36.287 --> 01:57:36.868]  He's like, what do you mean?
[01:57:36.908 --> 01:57:37.628]  I'm just asking questions.
[01:57:37.648 --> 01:57:38.289]  He came to the class.
[01:57:39.110 --> 01:57:39.790]  And I'm hearing this.
[01:57:41.131 --> 01:57:43.253]  It's just like, these people are eating themselves.
[01:57:43.873 --> 01:57:47.095]  The average American is realizing leftists are complete lunatics.
[01:57:48.556 --> 01:57:49.677]  It's like, they're here, man.
[01:57:49.697 --> 01:57:52.359]  I mean, they're running the damn country.
[01:57:54.061 --> 01:57:56.242]  And they're talking about how they're historic figures.
[01:57:57.603 --> 01:57:59.765]  Because they're a bunch of clowns running the country.
[01:58:00.899 --> 01:58:03.321]  Telling you what they like to do with their peepees.
[01:58:04.562 --> 01:58:06.283]  Stealing people's luggage at the airport.
[01:58:09.766 --> 01:58:10.747]  Where are the real men?
[01:58:10.787 --> 01:58:11.808]  Well, I tell you what.
[01:58:13.149 --> 01:58:17.312]  The real Republican leadership in Congress is women.
[01:58:17.993 --> 01:58:25.459]  I mean, I could give you a short list of the Republicans that are actually actively working to expose corruption in D.C.
[01:58:25.519 --> 01:58:27.460]  and restore the Republic.
[01:58:27.541 --> 01:58:30.263]  It's... Women are leading the way.
[01:58:31.198 --> 01:58:32.779]  Like Lauren Boebert.
[01:58:34.599 --> 01:58:42.702]  First, here she is talking about why she's filing the articles of impeachment, but getting into the spiritual aspect of it.
[01:58:43.422 --> 01:58:52.485]  Then she talks about what the Republican establishment is or isn't doing to support her, but first let's go to Lauren Boebert talking about the impeachment files.
[01:58:52.705 --> 01:58:57.407]  She has just, the files of impeachment she has just had against Joe Biden in clip 21.
[01:58:58.268 --> 01:58:59.068]  Well, glory to God.
[01:58:59.568 --> 01:59:01.269]  This is grace.
[01:59:01.309 --> 01:59:08.810]  This is God's empowerment and His ability and staying grounded, rooted in the Word of God, out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
[01:59:09.351 --> 01:59:12.031]  And I am directed and led by Him.
[01:59:12.071 --> 01:59:16.112]  You know, there was pressure for me not to introduce the articles of impeachment tonight.
[01:59:16.152 --> 01:59:19.353]  Well, not introduce them, but to bring them up and call them for a vote.
[01:59:19.953 --> 01:59:30.198]   And I said, you know, I have a piece, a still, In my spirit, and I'm going to be led by peace, not by the pressure from the outside.
[01:59:30.218 --> 01:59:35.662]  And we've seen that on full display with the Speakers Race, where Matt Gaetz and I were surrounded.
[01:59:36.302 --> 01:59:44.148]  Pressure from the outside, but strong on the inside, knowing that we are purposed, and that we are doing what is right, what is righteous.
[01:59:44.788 --> 01:59:47.909]  And I think just as you said, history will prove that.
[01:59:47.949 --> 01:59:54.531]  I'm not being like the press secretary and calling myself an historic figure, but history will prove that we were on the right side of the argument.
[01:59:54.951 --> 02:00:01.573]  And it is all about being led by the Spirit of God in everything that you do.
[02:00:01.953 --> 02:00:05.874]  I do give Him all glory for where I am, for the people that He has positioned me.
[02:00:06.194 --> 02:00:14.033]   with and in front of, to speak life into situations, and to hold the corrupt accountable.
[02:00:14.033 --> 02:00:21.113]   I'm grateful to be here and to help get our country back on track because we are that shining city on a hill.
[02:00:21.113 --> 02:00:26.954]   We are a beacon of light for the rest of the world, and it is the goodness of God that leads men to repentance.
[02:00:26.954 --> 02:00:35.634]   Now remember, they were counting votes for weeks after the midterm elections.
[02:00:35.634 --> 02:00:40.294]   They were counting votes for weeks to try to beat Lauren Boeber.
[02:00:39.898 --> 02:00:40.418]  You remember that?
[02:00:41.998 --> 02:00:45.919]  And then when the notion of a recount got brought up, the Democrats ran and hid.
[02:00:47.679 --> 02:00:50.460]  So Lauren Boebert, I mean, we're lucky she even got in.
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:52.260]  Now we see why they fought so hard to keep her out.
[02:00:52.961 --> 02:00:57.702]  So does she have the backing of the Republican leadership and establishment in the impeachment?
[02:00:57.742 --> 02:00:58.622]  Let's find out here in Clip 20.
[02:00:59.835 --> 02:01:02.096]  I have not heard of support from leadership at this time.
[02:01:02.756 --> 02:01:05.017]  There was encouragement not to bring this up.
[02:01:05.178 --> 02:01:05.818]  Why?
[02:01:05.918 --> 02:01:06.198]  Why?
[02:01:07.018 --> 02:01:12.841]  You know, that's a frustrating thing that I experience a lot here in Washington, D.C.
[02:01:13.601 --> 02:01:19.104]  In the Republican Party, there's a lot of go along to get along and we'll wait, we'll do it next time, we'll do it next Congress.
[02:01:19.504 --> 02:01:20.405]  I'm ready for action now.
[02:01:20.505 --> 02:01:27.228]   I have left my four boys and my grandson back in Colorado to serve the American people And I'm not here to waste my time.
[02:01:27.308 --> 02:01:28.589]  I'm not here to waste their time.
[02:01:28.950 --> 02:01:32.052]  I'm here for action and we have got to take control of our country.
[02:01:32.272 --> 02:01:35.474]  This is coming up this week.
[02:01:35.494 --> 02:01:35.754]  202-225-3121.
[02:01:35.774 --> 02:01:37.215]  So there you go.
[02:01:37.916 --> 02:01:40.678]  The answer is no help from Republican leadership.
[02:01:40.718 --> 02:01:41.999]  There is no Republican leadership.
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:43.400]  That's what it is.
[02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:44.921]  There's no Republican leadership.
[02:01:46.182 --> 02:01:48.924]  And the truth is this is really the problem overall.
[02:01:49.597 --> 02:01:51.297]  With the conservative movement.
[02:01:51.338 --> 02:01:53.378]  There is no real unity or leadership.
[02:01:53.798 --> 02:01:58.039]  And that's fine, we're independent-minded people, so it's like herding cats.
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:02.701]  But at that level, in Congress, there needs to be organization leadership, and there's none.
[02:02:03.761 --> 02:02:06.442]  Mitch McConnell and Ronna McDaniel are not even on the field.
[02:02:06.462 --> 02:02:07.702]  They're not even showing up to play.
[02:02:08.482 --> 02:02:09.683]  They're not even interested in the game.
[02:02:10.923 --> 02:02:14.524]  I mean, Mitch McConnell, seriously, have you heard or seen him at all?
[02:02:16.109 --> 02:02:18.310]  Ronna McDaniel's making logos for the RNC.
[02:02:18.570 --> 02:02:19.371]  Real tough stuff.
[02:02:19.571 --> 02:02:20.211]  That's her job.
[02:02:20.251 --> 02:02:21.812]  She's making some logos.
[02:02:22.793 --> 02:02:23.373]  Thank you, Ronna.
[02:02:24.574 --> 02:02:26.895]  Oh, the impeachment of the corrupt Biden family in the White House?
[02:02:27.015 --> 02:02:27.696]  No, no, no, no.
[02:02:27.716 --> 02:02:28.416]  We're not interested in that.
[02:02:28.436 --> 02:02:29.497]  We got a logo to make, okay?
[02:02:30.597 --> 02:02:32.038]  And Mitch McConnell is, I don't know.
[02:02:32.458 --> 02:02:32.799]  Nobody knows.
[02:02:33.779 --> 02:02:38.922]  I mean, Kevin McCarthy is, you know, the worst hitter on your team, but at least he's on the field.
[02:02:40.163 --> 02:02:51.835]   And then there's Annapolina Luna talking today about why The push to censor Adam Schiff and the vote will happen tonight in clip 27.
[02:02:52.956 --> 02:02:55.757]  Occupied a position of the highest trust and authority.
[02:02:56.578 --> 02:03:04.163]  As chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff launched an all-out political campaign built on baseless distortions against a sitting U.S.
[02:03:04.243 --> 02:03:09.727]  president at the expense of every single citizen in this country and the honor of the House of Representatives.
[02:03:10.467 --> 02:03:25.036]  With access to sensitive information unavailable to most members of Congress, and certainly not accessible to the American people, Schiff abused his privileges claiming to know the truth, while leaving Americans in the dark about this web of lies.
[02:03:25.736 --> 02:03:28.558]  Lies so severe that they alter the course of the country forever.
[02:03:28.578 --> 02:03:33.481]  The lie that President- The House is not in order.
[02:03:34.261 --> 02:03:36.403]  Members, please take your conversations off the floor.
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:48.630]  The lie that President Donald Trump colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 presidential election, revealed to be completely false by numerous investigations, including the Durham Report.
[02:03:49.230 --> 02:03:58.399]  The lie that the steal dossier, a folder of falsified and since completely debunked collusions, accusations funded by the Democrat Party, had any shred of credibility.
[02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:01.702]  Yet Schiff read it into congressional record as fact.
[02:04:02.503 --> 02:04:10.107]  Lies concocted and compiled in a false memo that was used to lie to the FISA court to precipitate domestic spying on U.S.
[02:04:10.127 --> 02:04:13.429]  citizen Carter Page, violating American civil liberties.
[02:04:14.349 --> 02:04:22.453]  Not only was this egregious abuse of Schiff's privilege access to classified information, but this memo was littered with 17 major mistakes and omissions.
[02:04:23.234 --> 02:04:27.756]  The groundless memo violated... Alright, so it goes on, her statements.
[02:04:27.796 --> 02:04:29.217]  The vote is going to be happening tonight.
[02:04:29.337 --> 02:04:29.457]  It's...
[02:04:30.761 --> 02:04:32.462]  I mean, it's 99% chance it's gonna pass.
[02:04:33.003 --> 02:04:33.623]  I would bet on it.
[02:04:34.564 --> 02:04:37.946]  And then if there was proper Republican leadership, we wouldn't have had to wait till now.
[02:04:37.966 --> 02:04:42.829]  It would have already happened, and maybe you could have stopped Schiff from sabotaging the Durham hearing today.
[02:04:42.869 --> 02:04:44.010]  But you don't have Republican leadership.
[02:04:44.730 --> 02:04:46.171]  So, hey, maybe that changes.
[02:04:46.211 --> 02:04:58.920]  We've seen the Republican Party come a long way in the last six years into anti-establishment and the Republican voters understanding the falsities in the Democrat versus Republican paradigm.
[02:05:00.067 --> 02:05:03.549]  And becoming truly grassroots, anti-establishment.
[02:05:04.869 --> 02:05:09.271]  Maybe the left can join us if RFK can get the nomination, but I don't think that's going to happen.
[02:05:09.291 --> 02:05:12.652]  They're going to steal it from him, probably with Gavin Newsom, I'm thinking at this point is what it looks like.
[02:05:13.313 --> 02:05:22.396]  That might be another conversation for another day, but boy oh boy, I'll tell you what, you know, I'm not going to act like there's not good men in Congress, because there definitely are.
[02:05:22.496 --> 02:05:23.457]  There's far too few.
[02:05:24.778 --> 02:05:25.578]  But maybe this is it.
[02:05:25.658 --> 02:05:27.639]  Maybe it's because, you know, AI just came out.
[02:05:27.679 --> 02:05:29.299]  There's an AI study that just came out.
[02:05:29.659 --> 02:05:32.839]  Conservative women are hotter, more attractive, and smarter than liberal women.
[02:05:32.859 --> 02:05:33.700]  Oh wow, go figure.
[02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:34.360]  Who didn't know that?
[02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:35.220]  So fine.
[02:05:35.260 --> 02:05:38.180]  So maybe we need more Lauren Barberts and Annapolina Lunas.
[02:05:38.601 --> 02:05:43.701]  Let's just go hot conservative chicks for Congress and maybe that'll save the country.
[02:05:43.781 --> 02:05:45.022]  I mean, I'm serious at this point.
[02:05:45.062 --> 02:05:46.762]  It's like President Camacho, these people.
[02:05:47.562 --> 02:05:48.342]  How many times?
[02:05:50.803 --> 02:05:52.203]  Because you start to realize something.
[02:05:55.131 --> 02:06:04.455]  I'm gonna play another clip from the hearing today, Durham and Schiff going back and forth, but... You know, this was the same mistake that Donald Trump made.
[02:06:04.475 --> 02:06:07.977]  I definitely think he's learned this, the hard way, unfortunately.
[02:06:09.417 --> 02:06:19.962]  But, it's the assumption, when you're dealing in D.C., whether it's Republican or Democrat, but I mean, with the Democrats, it's 100% guarantee they're up to shenanigans.
[02:06:22.210 --> 02:06:23.231]  But the Republicans do it too.
[02:06:24.071 --> 02:06:26.812]  Trump's biggest mistake was going into D.C.
[02:06:27.553 --> 02:06:35.957]  thinking that he's engaging with others that are into the D.C.
[02:06:36.277 --> 02:06:38.018]  culture and into the D.C.
[02:06:38.058 --> 02:06:41.240]  establishment, thinking that he'd be dealing with them in good faith.
[02:06:42.841 --> 02:06:45.002]  That was Donald Trump's biggest mistake.
[02:06:45.979 --> 02:06:51.283]  He thought he could go in there and actually have good, fake negotiations with the swamp, with the D.C.
[02:06:51.323 --> 02:06:51.863]  establishment.
[02:06:52.724 --> 02:06:54.806]  And he quickly realized that's not the case.
[02:06:55.346 --> 02:07:01.030]  And not only is it that we're not having good, fake negotiations, the expectation here is to sell America out!
[02:07:04.233 --> 02:07:06.734]  So he had to go through that process, and he learned that the hard way.
[02:07:07.315 --> 02:07:11.438]  And I think Durham is maybe kind of going through a similar realization after this hearing today.
[02:07:13.990 --> 02:07:20.812]  And you know, I'm sure he had plenty of cooperation in his investigation, and that's fine, and he speaks positively of Bob Mueller and all this other stuff, and that's fine.
[02:07:20.852 --> 02:07:28.913]  He expects, he thinks everyone here is above board, full faith and credit, we're all negotiating in good faith, we're all on the same team.
[02:07:30.734 --> 02:07:34.374]  But he's finding out real quick, that ain't the case with people like Adam Schiff.
[02:07:34.934 --> 02:07:35.455]  And I get it.
[02:07:37.155 --> 02:07:41.236]  It's like Lauren Boebert said, it's a lot of go along to get along in D.C.
[02:07:42.346 --> 02:07:43.426]  It's a lot of that going on.
[02:07:45.707 --> 02:07:49.427]  But see, you reach a certain point, you would think, you reach a certain point as a man.
[02:07:50.047 --> 02:07:51.848]  You reach a certain point as an American.
[02:07:52.068 --> 02:07:58.989]  You reach a certain point as a divinely created individual that, you know, these people are lying.
[02:07:59.069 --> 02:08:00.849]  These people are up to no good.
[02:08:00.910 --> 02:08:02.630]  These people are stabbing me in the back.
[02:08:05.070 --> 02:08:08.671]  This isn't a good faith negotiation, and I'm not going to go along to get along.
[02:08:10.609 --> 02:08:19.694]  So, maybe Durham gets a little hint of that in this exchange with Adam Schiff.
[02:08:20.894 --> 02:08:31.500]  Yeah, I mean, I think if you read what's in the cable and what's in the report is that what the diplomats reported was there was a suggestion of a suggestion that the Russians could help.
[02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:34.161]  They had damaging information as to Mrs. Clinton.
[02:08:34.181 --> 02:08:36.983]  By releasing it anonymously, right?
[02:08:37.523 --> 02:08:38.984]  And that's exactly what happened, isn't it?
[02:08:40.998 --> 02:08:41.538]  I don't, I don't.
[02:08:41.778 --> 02:08:42.598]  You really don't know?
[02:08:43.319 --> 02:08:45.839]  I'm not sure exactly, when you say exactly what happened.
[02:08:45.899 --> 02:08:48.980]  Well the Russians released stolen emails.
[02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:49.780]  Now what happened?
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:50.880]  They were cutouts, did they not?
[02:08:53.220 --> 02:08:54.061]  There were emails.
[02:08:54.441 --> 02:08:55.721]  It's a very simple question.
[02:08:55.761 --> 02:08:57.841]  Pause it real quick, pause it real quick.
[02:08:57.881 --> 02:09:01.782]  Because again, I don't want to come on here and bash Durham.
[02:09:03.702 --> 02:09:04.783]  That's not what this is about.
[02:09:04.863 --> 02:09:06.023]  I don't think he's the bad guy.
[02:09:07.108 --> 02:09:12.370]  Again, I think he's expecting that everybody in that Judiciary Committee is operating in good faith.
[02:09:13.110 --> 02:09:14.310]  They're not, John!
[02:09:15.711 --> 02:09:20.172]  And for whatever reason, he's so ignorant as to how things go that he's just now figuring this out.
[02:09:20.992 --> 02:09:22.132]  And here's the other thing.
[02:09:22.433 --> 02:09:33.496]  They keep asking him questions about the Mueller probe, and it's like he already answered the questions, and they just want him to say something else.
[02:09:34.881 --> 02:09:35.822]  And so he gets confused.
[02:09:35.842 --> 02:09:39.085]  He's like, wait a second, we're here addressing the fraud that led to the Mueller probe.
[02:09:39.125 --> 02:09:40.747]  I'm not addressing the Mueller probe.
[02:09:41.888 --> 02:09:43.930]  I'm addressing the fraud that led to the Mueller probe.
[02:09:43.970 --> 02:09:44.691]  That's what I investigate.
[02:09:44.711 --> 02:09:45.732]  You keep asking about the Mueller probe.
[02:09:45.992 --> 02:09:47.253]  But see, here's another instance right here.
[02:09:49.335 --> 02:09:58.104]  Durham is so ill-prepared for this hearing, not because he's not smart, just because he doesn't understand the playing field he's on.
[02:10:00.253 --> 02:10:06.976]  And so he's getting questions about WikiLeaks, he's getting questions about all this other stuff, and he's like, well, I don't know.
[02:10:07.076 --> 02:10:07.496]  What do you mean?
[02:10:08.937 --> 02:10:14.900]  I investigated the fraud that led to the Trump-Russia collusion hoax and the Steele dossier.
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:16.261]  That's what I investigated.
[02:10:16.281 --> 02:10:19.722]  You're asking me about WikiLeaks emails and sources that I don't know about.
[02:10:20.583 --> 02:10:23.084]  And he clearly is not prepared and does not know.
[02:10:23.604 --> 02:10:25.145]  Because, rewind it ten seconds, guys.
[02:10:26.345 --> 02:10:35.286]   Because here Adam Schiff is, claiming That the Russians stole and leaked Hillary Clinton's emails.
[02:10:35.627 --> 02:10:42.993]  That is, at the very least, unproven, if not certifiably false.
[02:10:46.095 --> 02:10:48.095]  And John Durham just has no clue.
[02:10:48.956 --> 02:11:01.098]  And so see, now Adam Schiff gets to sabotage the entire hearing and spout Democrat Party propaganda when the whole purpose of this was to expose Democrat Party propaganda.
[02:11:01.158 --> 02:11:03.179]  Schiff should be nowhere near this committee.
[02:11:03.739 --> 02:11:09.460]  And here he is sabotaging it and taking advantage of John Durham's ignorance on what really happened with the WikiLeaks emails.
[02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:24.950]   So here's John Durham getting questions about the WikiLeaks emails that he has no idea about, clearly, And Schiff telling you the big lie that Russia hacked and leaked the emails, which is not proven, or just completely false.
[02:11:25.250 --> 02:11:25.550]  Here it is.
[02:11:26.131 --> 02:11:27.492]  That's exactly what happened, isn't it?
[02:11:28.072 --> 02:11:28.253]  No.
[02:11:29.514 --> 02:11:31.135]  I don't, I don't... You really don't know?
[02:11:31.615 --> 02:11:39.442]  I'm not sure exactly, when you say exactly what happened... Well, the Russians released stolen emails through cutouts, did they not?
[02:11:39.522 --> 02:11:40.343]  He has no proof of that.
[02:11:41.766 --> 02:11:44.287]  There were emails... It's a very simple question.
[02:11:44.307 --> 02:11:47.889]  Did they release information, stolen information, through cutouts, yes or no?
[02:11:48.010 --> 02:11:50.611]  I'm not sure that... You really don't know the answer to that?
[02:11:51.451 --> 02:11:52.912]  The answer is yes, they did.
[02:11:53.273 --> 02:11:53.813]  Through D.C.
[02:11:53.873 --> 02:11:55.714]  leaks... You're lying again!
[02:11:55.734 --> 02:11:57.755]  Mueller's answer was yes.
[02:11:58.175 --> 02:11:59.816]  More important than mine, Mueller's answer was yes.
[02:12:00.517 --> 02:12:04.947]   Now that information, of course, was helpful To the Trump campaign, wasn't it?
[02:12:05.347 --> 02:12:09.849]  I don't think there's any question, but to the Russians... So imagine, pause it again.
[02:12:10.129 --> 02:12:10.869]  This is so key.
[02:12:10.889 --> 02:12:12.250]  And again, it's just so frustrating.
[02:12:12.290 --> 02:12:15.111]  It's like, again, I don't think Durham's a bad guy!
[02:12:15.131 --> 02:12:18.573]  But he clearly doesn't even know the world he lives on!
[02:12:20.934 --> 02:12:21.514]  And I get it.
[02:12:22.895 --> 02:12:23.955]  I'm a total nerd.
[02:12:24.516 --> 02:12:25.596]  I host a political talk show.
[02:12:25.736 --> 02:12:26.977]  I have to know about all this stuff.
[02:12:27.557 --> 02:12:30.659]  So I know all the stuff Schiff is talking about.
[02:12:31.579 --> 02:12:33.400]  And rewind it another 20 seconds so we can play it again.
[02:12:34.796 --> 02:12:37.698]  But Durham is caught so off guard here that it's pathetic.
[02:12:39.119 --> 02:12:42.921]  And Adam Schiff shouldn't even be on this committee telling you these lies.
[02:12:43.661 --> 02:12:46.623]  And he assumes the American people are so stupid that they don't know any difference.
[02:12:47.083 --> 02:12:52.446]  And he made the bet that Durham is ignorant and wouldn't know the difference, and he's cashing in on that bet.
[02:12:53.807 --> 02:12:54.848]  And notice how the people...
[02:12:56.508 --> 02:12:57.148]  I know that guy.
[02:12:57.188 --> 02:12:58.169]  He's been on the show before.
[02:12:58.229 --> 02:12:59.509]  He does a show.
[02:12:59.569 --> 02:13:03.311]  It's um... Is that Jason um... What's his name guys?
[02:13:03.371 --> 02:13:04.432]  It's killing me.
[02:13:04.452 --> 02:13:05.772]  He's on the screen there shaking his head.
[02:13:07.873 --> 02:13:09.794]  But everybody knows Schiff is up there lying.
[02:13:10.274 --> 02:13:11.655]  Except Durham apparently.
[02:13:11.675 --> 02:13:14.696]  I think that's Jason Goodman.
[02:13:14.716 --> 02:13:15.596]  I might be getting his name wrong.
[02:13:15.636 --> 02:13:16.077]  I apologize.
[02:13:16.097 --> 02:13:16.877]  But he's there shaking his head.
[02:13:16.917 --> 02:13:17.437]  I'm glad he's in there.
[02:13:17.457 --> 02:13:18.958]  Cause it's just... Schiff is just totally lying.
[02:13:19.881 --> 02:13:22.764]  So let's play that clip, starting it over right before he starts shaking his head here.
[02:13:23.284 --> 02:13:27.148]  Adam Schiff lying about the... Oh, but see, what does Schiff say?
[02:13:27.829 --> 02:13:30.692]  He says, oh, but weren't those emails helpful to the Trump campaign?
[02:13:31.092 --> 02:13:31.553]  Hmm.
[02:13:32.073 --> 02:13:36.618]  So why wouldn't you ask the question, why were the emails helpful to the Trump campaign?
[02:13:37.158 --> 02:13:40.862]  Oh, because it showed how corrupt the Democrat Party was!
[02:13:41.462 --> 02:13:42.644]  But that's not the issue.
[02:13:42.824 --> 02:13:43.424]  Alright, play it again.
[02:13:44.420 --> 02:13:45.981]  Tell you exactly what happened.
[02:13:46.041 --> 02:13:51.022]  Well, the Russians released stolen emails through cutouts, did they not?
[02:13:53.363 --> 02:13:54.183]  There were emails.
[02:13:54.544 --> 02:13:55.964]  It's a very simple question.
[02:13:55.984 --> 02:13:57.264]  They released information.
[02:13:57.565 --> 02:13:58.325]  Stolen information.
[02:13:58.345 --> 02:13:59.065]  Shake of the head.
[02:13:59.085 --> 02:14:00.386]  A heroic act.
[02:14:00.826 --> 02:14:02.226]  You really don't know the answer to that?
[02:14:03.066 --> 02:14:04.507]  The answer is yes, they did.
[02:14:04.847 --> 02:14:05.427]  Through D.C.
[02:14:05.467 --> 02:14:05.727]  leaks.
[02:14:05.747 --> 02:14:06.808]  Well, your mind is, yes.
[02:14:08.502 --> 02:14:09.363]  Mueller's answer was yes.
[02:14:09.763 --> 02:14:11.404]  More important than mine, Mueller's answer was yes.
[02:14:12.124 --> 02:14:16.567]  Now, that information, of course, was helpful to the Trump campaign, wasn't it?
[02:14:17.107 --> 02:14:17.227]  Why?
[02:14:17.287 --> 02:14:26.873]  I don't think there's any question, but the Russians intruded into... Well, I just want to... ... hacked into the systems, they released information... And that was helpful to the Trump campaign, right?
[02:14:27.094 --> 02:14:35.659]  And the conclusion in the ICA and in the Mueller investigation was that the Russians intended to assist... You didn't answer my question, Mr. Durham.
[02:14:35.699 --> 02:14:37.300]  That was helpful to the Trump campaign, right?
[02:14:38.349 --> 02:14:46.055]  And Trump made use of that, as I said, didn't he, by touting those stolen documents on the campaign trail over a hundred times?
[02:14:47.496 --> 02:14:50.618]  I said, I don't really read the newspapers or listen to the news.
[02:14:51.238 --> 02:14:58.984]  You're totally oblivious to Donald Trump's use of the stolen emails on the campaign trail more than a hundred times?
[02:14:59.924 --> 02:15:01.165]  Did that escape your attention?
[02:15:02.306 --> 02:15:03.127]  I'm not aware of that.
[02:15:04.304 --> 02:15:07.926]  So, unfortunately for John Durham, he was completely ill-prepared for this.
[02:15:08.226 --> 02:15:09.987]  And Adam Schiff just ate his lunch.
[02:15:10.507 --> 02:15:12.488]  But Schiff shouldn't have been there to begin with.
[02:15:13.749 --> 02:15:14.569]  That's the problem.
[02:15:15.290 --> 02:15:23.854]  Schiff, a known liar, sabotages that part of the hearing and makes it about Trump-Russia collusion, which never happened.
[02:15:23.994 --> 02:15:25.214]  That was the whole point of the hearing.
[02:15:27.616 --> 02:15:31.978]  And it's all because Republicans don't have enough leadership to get that scumbag off of that committee.
[02:15:34.898 --> 02:15:38.421]  Kate Daly coming up hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:38.481 --> 02:15:39.822]  I'll be back hosting the War Room.
[02:15:39.842 --> 02:15:42.745]  We got all kinds of huge news and huge guests coming up on the War Room.
[02:15:43.125 --> 02:15:45.407]  Folks, remember to shop at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:15:46.308 --> 02:15:48.390]  That's how everything we do here is possible.
[02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:50.732]  Big sales happening right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:15:54.317 --> 02:16:01.221]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:16:01.341 --> 02:16:04.183]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[02:16:04.263 --> 02:16:04.904]  How are you today?
[02:16:04.924 --> 02:16:06.665]  I have so much on my mind today.
[02:16:06.685 --> 02:16:08.006]  We're going to cover a lot of ground.
[02:16:08.346 --> 02:16:10.687]  I even want to talk about the Titanic today.
[02:16:10.927 --> 02:16:17.692]  Things in the news, because it's in the news, things that just aren't said a lot about it that I think people should know.
[02:16:19.097 --> 02:16:20.097]  But I want to start here.
[02:16:20.197 --> 02:16:26.482]  I want to start with a more personal story that I've been sort of dealing with in the last couple of weeks.
[02:16:27.783 --> 02:16:34.188]  For like 13 years, I have this local show for my state, my own community, and then I go on and I do a national show.
[02:16:34.868 --> 02:16:36.630]  And the local show was canceled.
[02:16:36.650 --> 02:16:38.091]  It was canceled just out of the blue.
[02:16:39.412 --> 02:16:45.616]  And it's been a crazy road because of the things that we expose that was pretty unique.
[02:16:45.676 --> 02:16:47.718]  We had people listening from all over the country.
[02:16:48.510 --> 02:16:52.572]  All over the country to this little local hour and I could never figure out why.
[02:16:52.612 --> 02:16:53.732]  What was the appeal for that?
[02:16:54.572 --> 02:17:01.195]  But then I started really thinking about it and when people were calling in, they were saying, gosh, you know, your local issues are our local issues.
[02:17:02.275 --> 02:17:04.096]  And I thought, you know, that's very, very true.
[02:17:04.116 --> 02:17:11.859]  Our local issues are everyone's local issues across America right now because all the same things are happening all across America.
[02:17:12.742 --> 02:17:34.677]  Even in Northern Idaho, there was a post where they were trying to post out some information about 170 people showing up at a local meeting of commissioners and local members who are trying to push a traffic data management center and more cameras for those counties in the name, of course, you know, safety and reducing traffic congestion.
[02:17:35.537 --> 02:17:43.230]   Not a single person of the 170 in the audience Raise their hand desiring any camera at all.
[02:17:44.612 --> 02:18:00.932]  And the reason I bring this up is because they were having this another town hall and they now think a thousand people are going to show up and they're going to put themselves in front of the faces of the agenda pushers on my local show before it was censored and canceled.
[02:18:01.997 --> 02:18:04.559]  I was talking about all the bad deeds, right?
[02:18:04.639 --> 02:18:07.040]  Of course, in a city, which is highly unlikely.
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:09.602]  If you look across America right now, we have a huge problem.
[02:18:10.102 --> 02:18:27.648]   And that is, is that You can't find localized radio shows that are willing to go on the air and expose things like election fraud or the use of drought to control people or all the things, all the crazy shenanigans, all the things.
[02:18:28.188 --> 02:18:33.671]  They even at one point had put in a document, this passes constitutional muster.
[02:18:34.431 --> 02:18:35.432]  What the hell is muster?
[02:18:35.572 --> 02:18:36.772]  Muster is not even a thing.
[02:18:36.792 --> 02:18:39.674]   There's no such thing as Muster!
[02:18:40.134 --> 02:18:42.296]  But that was the attorneys talking for the city.
[02:18:42.376 --> 02:18:47.500]  They, you know, I guess there's a thing called constitutional muster, whatever the hell that is.
[02:18:48.220 --> 02:18:56.927]  So all of those things we were exposing and the end of public commenting, public meetings, you guys are all dealing with that too in your cities.
[02:18:57.207 --> 02:18:58.228]  You might not know about it.
[02:18:58.248 --> 02:18:59.949]  You might not have a show that exposes it.
[02:19:00.510 --> 02:19:12.235]   But I certainly felt the heat of being canceled as far as people professing to love America, yet Not wanting, well, really, truly only wanting Rhino Radio.
[02:19:13.196 --> 02:19:16.799]  In conservative states and lefty radio, in the other states.
[02:19:17.220 --> 02:19:18.941]  And that's what people are left with now.
[02:19:19.522 --> 02:19:21.464]  You've got Rhino, what is Rhino Radio?
[02:19:21.544 --> 02:19:36.125]   Rhino Radio Republican in name only, where you're a conservative state, so you kind of pretend to be conservative, and then what you do is you ask the mayor on, or you ask the city council members on, or you ask the county commissioners on, and you fill them with fluff.
[02:19:36.445 --> 02:19:38.166]  And everyone goes, aren't we great?
[02:19:38.226 --> 02:19:39.806]  You're doing a good job, buddy.
[02:19:40.227 --> 02:19:40.667]  Keep it up!
[02:19:41.443 --> 02:19:49.225]  Never mind Agenda 30, Agenda... all the things you're pushing, all the doubling and tripling of budgets, but just, you know, you're good.
[02:19:49.386 --> 02:19:50.026]  We like you.
[02:19:50.106 --> 02:19:52.346]  And then you end on a happy note, like taking a Valium.
[02:19:52.366 --> 02:19:53.287]  Kind of the same thing.
[02:19:53.747 --> 02:19:54.667]  It's Valium radio.
[02:19:55.527 --> 02:20:07.016]   And what I like about Alex's show, and even though I'm talking about local and this is more obviously national, is You should be very pissed off about your country right now.
[02:20:07.196 --> 02:20:09.498]  You should be very mad about what's going on.
[02:20:09.758 --> 02:20:11.880]  And if somebody says to you, I don't want to be mad.
[02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:15.923]  I just want to be happy and put my head in the sand and be told everything's great.
[02:20:16.444 --> 02:20:17.464]  Everything's not great.
[02:20:18.045 --> 02:20:25.691]  I was the last of the little guys, the last of those shows that, that, that have to exist in America.
[02:20:25.711 --> 02:20:34.667]   And as everybody looks towards the flag and And salutes and gets teary eyed as they hear the songs and they say, I profess to love America.
[02:20:35.007 --> 02:20:37.468]  How many people are willing to put on the brown shirt?
[02:20:38.348 --> 02:20:45.209]  How many people are willing to do that in their communities to cancel people telling the truth?
[02:20:45.969 --> 02:20:46.770]  Isn't that amazing?
[02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:48.050]  I have a little more.
[02:20:48.190 --> 02:20:48.730]  I'll be right back.
[02:20:48.770 --> 02:20:51.991]  Kate Daly or Kate Daly on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:52.551 --> 02:20:54.151]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:54.833 --> 02:20:56.215]  You know, it can do a lot of good.
[02:20:56.556 --> 02:20:58.118]  Radio can be a lot of awareness.
[02:20:58.218 --> 02:21:00.982]  It can showcase the things that need to be showcased.
[02:21:01.203 --> 02:21:03.025]  It can talk about the things that need to be talked about.
[02:21:03.406 --> 02:21:04.828]  And we don't have it in America.
[02:21:05.469 --> 02:21:09.976]  In local, we do in some national shows like this, but in local radio, we don't.
[02:21:11.019 --> 02:21:20.243]  And a lot of pressure needs to be put on the stations that opt for Rhino Radio and make sure that they put on and air people that are willing to ask questions.
[02:21:20.583 --> 02:21:24.644]  You know, I never had a problem with with politicians not liking me.
[02:21:25.184 --> 02:21:27.225]  Maybe if I was younger, I might have had a problem with that.
[02:21:27.405 --> 02:21:27.765]  I'm not.
[02:21:28.046 --> 02:21:32.447]  And so I never had a problem with with getting a lot of the blowback.
[02:21:33.248 --> 02:21:35.088]  And so I was willing to expose.
[02:21:35.288 --> 02:21:39.630]  I was willing to talk about the hard subjects, also the good things, too, but the hard things.
[02:21:40.772 --> 02:21:49.995]  And certainly the powers that be prevailed and that local hour is gone and lots of people from all over the country that listen to it are sad to see that go.
[02:21:50.835 --> 02:21:58.918]  And podcasts in the future for local politics is going to be the way that things have to happen because the airwaves are completely controlled.
[02:21:59.498 --> 02:22:00.978]  And it's a really tough spot.
[02:22:01.158 --> 02:22:04.659]  And so when shows are saying, look, we're struggling to stay on.
[02:22:04.679 --> 02:22:05.480]  You got to help us out.
[02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:17.049]   We really do need people to help because that's what keeps It's what keeps the subjects at hand, the things that have to be exposed.
[02:22:17.790 --> 02:22:20.732]  If you leave a radio show every day happy, something's wrong.
[02:22:20.852 --> 02:22:22.453]  You're listening probably to NPR.
[02:22:24.094 --> 02:22:28.377]  Something is not right in the universe because of what's going on in the country.
[02:22:28.417 --> 02:22:29.998]  Look around you, the state of the country.
[02:22:31.179 --> 02:22:36.803]  And so I wanted to talk for a moment because of Independence Day coming before I get to the Titanic stuff.
[02:22:36.823 --> 02:22:38.304]  I just wanted to talk for just a moment.
[02:22:39.119 --> 02:22:50.372]  About flags, because I think it's such an abomination that a flag is used for sexual choice in America, when flags meant something very, very, very different.
[02:22:51.278 --> 02:23:02.590]  When we were starting this country, it was necessary to have a distinct flag, and the Continental Congress appointed three people, a committee, to take the subject into consideration.
[02:23:02.911 --> 02:23:06.174]  And this was important, because back then, this is how you communicated.
[02:23:06.214 --> 02:23:07.195]  This is our flag.
[02:23:07.576 --> 02:23:08.457]  We are different from you.
[02:23:08.497 --> 02:23:09.378]  This is what we stand for.
[02:23:10.006 --> 02:23:25.731]  They repaired to a little American army, a little over 9,000 strong, and then assembled at Cambridge and adopted one composed of seven white and seven red stripes and named it the Great American or the Great Union Flag.
[02:23:26.411 --> 02:23:27.512]  And the crosses of St.
[02:23:27.532 --> 02:23:28.172]  George and St.
[02:23:28.292 --> 02:23:36.535]  Andrew were retained to show the willingness of the colonies to return to their allegiance to the British Crown, actually, but only if their rights were secured.
[02:23:36.795 --> 02:23:37.695]  Most people don't know that.
[02:23:38.379 --> 02:23:42.342]  They actually wanted to, but at the time they said, but only if our rights are secured.
[02:23:43.002 --> 02:23:45.584]  This flag was first hoisted the first day of January in 1776.
[02:23:46.185 --> 02:23:57.793]  And in the meantime, all the colonies had adopted all these distinctive badges so that the different bodies of troops then, you know, that flocked to the army each had its own banner because they wanted to be individual.
[02:23:57.893 --> 02:23:59.254]  It was all about being individual.
[02:23:59.894 --> 02:24:06.319]  And in Connecticut, each regiment had its own standard, you could say, on which represented the arms of the colony.
[02:24:07.262 --> 02:24:12.068]  And with the motto of, He who transplanted us will sustain us.
[02:24:12.708 --> 02:24:13.569]  Huge faith in God.
[02:24:14.571 --> 02:24:22.059]  And so, of course, 19 or 1775, there was that red flag, you know, an appeal to heaven, which what was on it.
[02:24:22.219 --> 02:24:27.946]  And then, of course, the floating batteries with the white ground with the same appeal to heaven on it.
[02:24:28.539 --> 02:24:30.820]  And so you had all this representation of God.
[02:24:31.100 --> 02:24:33.220]  You had all this representation of our rights.
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:49.524]  You also had Colonel Gadsden presented to Congress a flag that many of you might have, and I'm so happy that you have that, to be used in the Navy, which consisted of the rattlesnake on the yellow ground, that one, with 13 rattles and coiled to strike.
[02:24:49.544 --> 02:24:52.065]  13 rattles, right?
[02:24:52.085 --> 02:24:52.625]  13 colonies.
[02:24:52.765 --> 02:24:54.165]  And the motto was, don't tread on me.
[02:24:54.525 --> 02:24:55.646]  The great Union flag.
[02:24:58.433 --> 02:25:00.395]  An amazing flag, right?
[02:25:00.976 --> 02:25:17.232]  And then in 1777, just a few years later, they passed the following resolution that the flag of the 13 United States be 13 stripes, alternate red and white, and that the Union be 13 stars, white and a blue field representing a new constellation.
[02:25:18.297 --> 02:25:25.062]  And a constellation, however, could not be well represented on a flag, and so it was changed to a circle of stars.
[02:25:25.623 --> 02:25:28.845]  And that's how we got the circle, to represent harmony and union.
[02:25:29.306 --> 02:25:37.392]  And red is supposed to represent courage, white, integrity of purpose, and blue, steadfastness, love, and faith.
[02:25:37.792 --> 02:25:38.913]  It's a beautiful thing, isn't it?
[02:25:40.143 --> 02:25:47.789]  And of course, the flag was born and feared around the entire globe and also respected for what it was doing with rights.
[02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:58.957]  In our country, it only took 80 years from the inception of America, not from when we landed, but from the inception of the actual America, to end slavery.
[02:25:59.157 --> 02:25:59.958]  Only 80 years.
[02:25:59.998 --> 02:26:03.040]  It had been going on worldwide for centuries.
[02:26:04.321 --> 02:26:06.003]  Purple, white, black, everybody.
[02:26:06.443 --> 02:26:07.824]  Everybody was involved in slavery.
[02:26:08.943 --> 02:26:11.324]  And this country set out to make men equal.
[02:26:11.364 --> 02:26:12.805]  It was never going to happen overnight.
[02:26:13.385 --> 02:26:15.787]  It took some time, but it did, right?
[02:26:16.247 --> 02:26:16.967]  And 80 years.
[02:26:17.087 --> 02:26:23.451]  And it was the white Quakers, actually, and a few slaves that had escaped that formed the Underground Railroad.
[02:26:23.551 --> 02:26:31.375]  Harriet Tubman only came in the last 15 years of an 80-year battle to create that Underground Railroad.
[02:26:31.775 --> 02:26:33.116]  It was so vital and important.
[02:26:33.356 --> 02:26:37.904]   The second the ink was dry on that Constitution, We were already going to bat.
[02:26:38.305 --> 02:26:42.929]  There was about 325,000 families that had slaves in America, mostly in the South.
[02:26:43.730 --> 02:26:47.573]  And mostly not in all of the other parts of America, so mostly in the South.
[02:26:48.434 --> 02:26:51.016]  And then we created the Underground Railroad.
[02:26:51.336 --> 02:26:55.180]  A lot of white congregations risked everything to do it, right?
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:56.581]  And did it.
[02:26:57.041 --> 02:26:57.402]  Quakers.
[02:26:58.567 --> 02:27:08.411]  And so we had Juneteenth just pop up, which breaks my heart because Juneteenth actually is a little bit of a fallacy.
[02:27:08.731 --> 02:27:13.172]  It actually didn't happen until later when three Union states were the holdouts.
[02:27:13.212 --> 02:27:15.213]  Three Union states, not Southern states.
[02:27:15.593 --> 02:27:16.714]  Three Union states.
[02:27:17.114 --> 02:27:22.296]  And so you know that the war was not fought over slavery, but that it ended in about 80 years.
[02:27:22.476 --> 02:27:24.476]  These are all important things to remember, right?
[02:27:24.516 --> 02:27:26.237]  These are all important things to understand.
[02:27:28.435 --> 02:27:38.439]  In 1818, it changed back to 13 stripes with 21 stars, and it was provided that a new star on this flag should be added to the Union on the admission of each new state.
[02:27:38.879 --> 02:27:39.199]  Okay?
[02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:42.081]  It was the symbol of our nationality, a record of our glory.
[02:27:42.941 --> 02:27:43.681]  In what?
[02:27:44.101 --> 02:27:51.524]  In getting a country where you and me and everyone and every citizen in this country owns their government.
[02:27:52.244 --> 02:27:53.885]  You don't see that going on right now, do you?
[02:27:55.407 --> 02:27:56.989]  We have two-tiered justice systems.
[02:27:57.009 --> 02:27:59.331]  We have all kinds of things, all kinds of crap.
[02:27:59.371 --> 02:28:00.633]  We have all kinds of distractions.
[02:28:00.673 --> 02:28:01.894]  We have all kinds of things going on.
[02:28:02.695 --> 02:28:11.445]  But what's interesting is, is that flag is folded into 13 times in remembrance in the original 13 colonies.
[02:28:11.545 --> 02:28:12.246]  Did you know that?
[02:28:12.873 --> 02:28:20.959]  Did you know that on military.com, they actually have an explanation and the meaning behind the 13-folds, which we never talk about in America, and I'm not quite sure why.
[02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:26.444]  If you go and try to fact check it, you gotta love the fact checkers, those pinheads, liberal pinheads.
[02:28:26.504 --> 02:28:31.748]  But we know what they say about it, they say, well, we don't know who created it, so therefore it doesn't, it's not real.
[02:28:32.768 --> 02:28:33.608]  It's very real.
[02:28:33.728 --> 02:28:35.609]  It's actually on military.com.
[02:28:35.649 --> 02:28:40.470]  It's actually on so many sites like US Flag and everywhere else.
[02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:45.992]  But the flag folding ceremony represents the same religious principles on which our country was originally founded.
[02:28:46.432 --> 02:28:48.572]  The first fold of our flag is a symbol of life.
[02:28:48.952 --> 02:28:51.973]  The second fold is a symbol of our belief in eternal life.
[02:28:52.433 --> 02:28:57.192]   The third fold is made in honor and remembrance of the veteran departing our ranks who gave
[02:28:57.192 --> 02:29:02.393]   a portion of his life or her life to attain peace throughout the world.
[02:29:02.393 --> 02:29:08.873]   The fourth fold represents our weaker nature as American citizens trusting in God and as
[02:29:08.873 --> 02:29:11.373]  we turn to him in times of peace.
[02:29:11.373 --> 02:29:14.433]  The fifth fold is a tribute to our country.
[02:29:14.433 --> 02:29:17.673]  The sixth fold is for where our hearts lie.
[02:29:17.673 --> 02:29:22.272]   It is within our heart the Pledge of Allegiance of the Flag of the United States of America,
[02:29:22.272 --> 02:29:26.713]   for which, you know, and to which Republic for which it stands, one nation under God,
[02:29:26.713 --> 02:29:28.713]  indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
[02:29:29.279 --> 02:29:35.143]  The seventh fold is a tribute to our armed forces, for it is through the armed forces that protect the country, right?
[02:29:35.824 --> 02:29:44.370]  The eighth fold is a tribute to the one who entered into the valley of the shadow of death, that we might see the light of day and to honor our mother for whom it flies on Mother's Day.
[02:29:44.791 --> 02:29:46.732]  The ninth fold, and isn't that great?
[02:29:47.172 --> 02:29:47.733]  Mother's Day.
[02:29:47.913 --> 02:29:49.274]  You don't even have to be a biologist.
[02:29:49.923 --> 02:29:52.706]  You just know that it's Mother's Day and that it's done, that eighth fold.
[02:29:53.246 --> 02:29:55.128]  The ninth fold is a tribute to womanhood.
[02:29:55.308 --> 02:29:55.889]  Can you imagine?
[02:29:56.690 --> 02:30:03.016]  It has been through their faith, love, loyalty, and devotion that has molded the character of men and women who have made this country great.
[02:30:03.436 --> 02:30:08.822]  The tenth fold is a tribute to a father who has also given his sons and daughters for the defense of our country.
[02:30:09.457 --> 02:30:17.239]  The 11th fold represents a lower portion of the seal of the King David and King Solomon and glorifies the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[02:30:17.580 --> 02:30:23.641]  The 12th fold represents an emblem of eternity and glorifies God, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
[02:30:23.981 --> 02:30:30.363]  And the 13th and last fold, the stars are uppermost, reminding us of our national motto, In God We Trust.
[02:30:32.064 --> 02:30:38.606]  Those 13 folds are really, really important to what our country is, what it stands for, and what we need to remain.
[02:30:39.343 --> 02:30:40.764]  I'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:41.024 --> 02:30:42.924]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:42.964 --> 02:30:46.826]  So happy to be with you today and be given this opportunity to speak out.
[02:30:47.326 --> 02:30:50.327]  I know so many of you want to speak out, and I understand that.
[02:30:50.367 --> 02:30:51.267]  I understand why.
[02:30:51.507 --> 02:30:54.368]  You've seen your country crumble, and you don't know what to do.
[02:30:55.049 --> 02:31:03.712]  And it's getting more difficult because so many people, like my friend says, Uncle Mildy, you know, everyone's willing to wear the brown shirt.
[02:31:04.172 --> 02:31:06.973]  And if so many people are willing to wear the brown shirt, what are we going to do?
[02:31:07.796 --> 02:31:17.918]  And I want to address that because in my local county, they went as far as to make this really ridiculous whereas statement, you know, we are America's county.
[02:31:18.118 --> 02:31:19.179]  America's county!
[02:31:19.279 --> 02:31:28.161]  We believe in freedom and love and liberty and all of these things kind of frothing all over themselves and acting like they were the founders of America writing out this statement.
[02:31:28.581 --> 02:31:38.936]   At the same time, Abolishing, you know, freedom of speech right in front of their eyes with the removal of radio that would hold their feet to the fire.
[02:31:39.917 --> 02:31:41.657]  So the hypocrisy is insane.
[02:31:41.978 --> 02:31:44.018]  The amount of hypocrisy in America.
[02:31:44.198 --> 02:31:51.361]  So many people professing to love the flag, love America, and then do their little piece to help destroy it along the way.
[02:31:51.461 --> 02:31:52.302]  So what can we do?
[02:31:52.382 --> 02:31:54.422]  And I know a lot of you are probably wondering about that.
[02:31:55.143 --> 02:32:00.472]   Well, if companies stop With the robotics.
[02:32:00.772 --> 02:32:02.254]  If companies say, you know what?
[02:32:02.454 --> 02:32:04.136]  I don't care what money it's going to save us.
[02:32:04.216 --> 02:32:06.458]  We'll just go with people instead.
[02:32:07.219 --> 02:32:12.224]  It takes an awful lot of minions and an awful lot of people to carry out the plans of the deep state.
[02:32:12.965 --> 02:32:15.968]  If they don't have a willing populace, they can't do anything.
[02:32:15.988 --> 02:32:17.109]  There's not enough of them.
[02:32:17.839 --> 02:32:18.759]  Controlling everything.
[02:32:18.819 --> 02:32:32.805]  They rely on everybody getting a little piece of something in order for gain and whether that is promises and favors and political favors and cash and from the feds or cash from the state or whatever that whatever it is.
[02:32:33.545 --> 02:32:35.906]  Our local community is really where the fight is.
[02:32:36.946 --> 02:32:42.887]  This is why localized radio throughout America is really dangerous, is because that's where the fight is.
[02:32:43.328 --> 02:32:54.610]  Because locally in every single community, the things you learn on Alex Jones Show about Agenda 30, the things that we talk about with election fraud, all of the things that are going on right now can be stopped in your local community.
[02:32:56.391 --> 02:32:57.951]  3,000 local communities, that's it.
[02:32:58.631 --> 02:33:02.292]  You save those local communities, we actually have a prayer saving America.
[02:33:03.018 --> 02:33:06.439]  We're never going to save it federally if you go top down.
[02:33:07.359 --> 02:33:08.860]  And the president, that's a figurehead.
[02:33:09.320 --> 02:33:12.941]  It doesn't even matter at this point who is sitting in that seat anymore.
[02:33:13.461 --> 02:33:19.482]  You could have, you know, the five reincarnations of plastic Joey, because who knows who's under the mask?
[02:33:19.962 --> 02:33:25.944]  Or, and his little VP, Hormala, it doesn't matter who's at the helm because it's not who's really running things.
[02:33:26.864 --> 02:33:29.405]  So your local community is where they actually have to face you.
[02:33:30.538 --> 02:33:33.900]  In my local community, they stopped public comment at public meetings!
[02:33:33.980 --> 02:33:35.921]  Can you even believe they could get away with that?
[02:33:36.822 --> 02:33:37.222]  They did.
[02:33:37.922 --> 02:33:38.182]  Why?
[02:33:38.202 --> 02:33:43.005]  Because so many favors are given out, so many things are happening right under our noses in our local communities.
[02:33:44.126 --> 02:33:56.253]  It is so grotesque to say you love America and then do things in your local community, whether you're getting something for it, whatever the price is, it's not worth your liberty.
[02:33:56.913 --> 02:33:58.594]  It is not worth your freedom.
[02:33:59.873 --> 02:34:03.955]  It could never be, because you're talking about the liberty and freedom of your children.
[02:34:04.835 --> 02:34:06.616]  You're willing to trade that for a piece of silver?
[02:34:07.177 --> 02:34:16.361]  You're willing to trade that for, gotta get along, gotta get along with everybody, gotta make friends, gotta be nice to all the movers and shakers of the community?
[02:34:16.921 --> 02:34:19.102]  That's the problem we have in America right now.
[02:34:19.442 --> 02:34:22.744]  Too many people want to do that, and they want to prevent the exposure of things.
[02:34:23.208 --> 02:34:24.529]  How dangerous is that?
[02:34:25.050 --> 02:34:30.675]  I'm pretty sure we fought a revolution over this so that we wouldn't be dealing with this anymore.
[02:34:31.415 --> 02:34:33.918]  Those 13 folds of that flag mean something to me.
[02:34:34.618 --> 02:34:35.819]  They should mean something to you, too.
[02:34:36.460 --> 02:34:49.105]   When I see the destruction of freedom of speech in this country, whistleblowers being snuffed out, radio people being silenced into submission, That should scare the hell out of you.
[02:34:49.125 --> 02:34:50.406]  You should be so angry.
[02:34:50.426 --> 02:35:00.896]  The last thing you should be wanting is Valium Rhino Radio or Valium Lefty Radio that puts all your concentration on all the wrong things.
[02:35:01.417 --> 02:35:02.938]  That is our problem in America.
[02:35:03.499 --> 02:35:08.184]  We don't talk enough about what those 13 folds are about or the symbolism of that.
[02:35:08.224 --> 02:35:09.405]  You know what we concentrate on?
[02:35:09.425 --> 02:35:10.105]  The crap!
[02:35:10.786 --> 02:35:11.267]  The crap!
[02:35:12.242 --> 02:35:15.103]  You know, I thought little Hormala was our VP.
[02:35:15.163 --> 02:35:16.063]  Nowhere to be seen.
[02:35:16.123 --> 02:35:17.163]  Where is she, by the way?
[02:35:17.363 --> 02:35:21.344]  There's a lot of people just sort of missing now, and I don't want her to be on stage.
[02:35:21.444 --> 02:35:21.904]  Trust me.
[02:35:22.104 --> 02:35:24.724]  She's annoying, and nobody respects her in America.
[02:35:25.665 --> 02:35:27.205]  Everybody knows that we were cooed.
[02:35:27.565 --> 02:35:32.666]  But my gosh, these people just sort of disappear, and then no one asks why, because we get all these distractions.
[02:35:33.446 --> 02:35:35.386]  I thought they were poisoning Putin months ago.
[02:35:35.526 --> 02:35:36.587]  Don't you remember those headlines?
[02:35:36.767 --> 02:35:37.247]  Poison!
[02:35:37.647 --> 02:35:38.887]  Putin's being poisoned!
[02:35:39.659 --> 02:35:40.459]  Where did that go?
[02:35:40.479 --> 02:35:43.341]  I thought nukes were getting launched and were attacking us.
[02:35:43.401 --> 02:35:45.262]  Don't you guys remember the headlines in December?
[02:35:45.542 --> 02:35:48.463]  Nukes were being set up and pointed.
[02:35:48.483 --> 02:35:49.504]  Oh my gosh.
[02:35:49.624 --> 02:35:51.405]  I thought China was taking out Taiwan.
[02:35:51.545 --> 02:35:52.265]  Is that not happening?
[02:35:52.845 --> 02:35:55.066]  I thought Russia wanted to get involved in our elections.
[02:35:55.386 --> 02:35:56.167]  They suddenly don't?
[02:35:56.847 --> 02:36:02.650]  And by the way, did anyone ever disclose why they wanted to get involved in our elections or why they even cared?
[02:36:03.701 --> 02:36:03.921]  Nope.
[02:36:04.081 --> 02:36:06.003]  What did they have to gain at that point?
[02:36:06.524 --> 02:36:06.764]  See?
[02:36:07.004 --> 02:36:11.508]  Three years of the crap crazy fest shoved in our faces.
[02:36:11.989 --> 02:36:12.990]  Adam Schiff lying.
[02:36:13.310 --> 02:36:14.671]  He gets nothing for lying.
[02:36:15.052 --> 02:36:15.472]  Nothing!
[02:36:15.492 --> 02:36:17.274]  He just goes about his way.
[02:36:17.354 --> 02:36:17.634]  Why?
[02:36:17.654 --> 02:36:25.141]  20 Republicans, conservatives said it was totally fine to lie and lie and lie and lie to us.
[02:36:25.871 --> 02:36:26.891]  I thought the debt ceiling.
[02:36:26.991 --> 02:36:28.072]  What happened to the debt ceiling?
[02:36:28.252 --> 02:36:29.252]  Oh, got extended.
[02:36:29.632 --> 02:36:32.693]  I thought we were all going to die of COVID if we didn't put shots in our rear ends.
[02:36:33.133 --> 02:36:33.953]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[02:36:33.973 --> 02:36:34.573]  We're all fine.
[02:36:34.933 --> 02:36:36.454]  I thought North Korea was going to nuke us.
[02:36:36.774 --> 02:36:39.774]  I thought ISIS was going to come over here and terrorize us city by city.
[02:36:40.454 --> 02:36:44.535]  I thought Fed said they were using all the tunnels in America to get pieces of bombs through them, right?
[02:36:45.216 --> 02:36:45.416]  Right?
[02:36:45.456 --> 02:36:46.476]  They said that 10 years ago.
[02:36:46.496 --> 02:36:47.676]  They've been saying it for 10 years.
[02:36:48.236 --> 02:36:51.077]  Or maybe they're just, I don't know, watching the trafficking coming in.
[02:36:51.713 --> 02:36:52.974]  I thought we were all going to get Ebola.
[02:36:53.274 --> 02:36:54.755]  I thought we were all going to get monkeypox.
[02:36:54.995 --> 02:36:55.615]  What happened to that?
[02:36:57.116 --> 02:36:58.297]  Kind of in favor of it now.
[02:36:58.317 --> 02:37:04.341]  I thought climate change was coming at the end of every decade for six decades to get us.
[02:37:05.001 --> 02:37:06.202]  I thought it was going to freeze us out.
[02:37:06.582 --> 02:37:09.144]  I thought it was going to heat us up to death.
[02:37:09.384 --> 02:37:09.844]  What happened?
[02:37:10.305 --> 02:37:11.745]  I thought the polar caps were melting.
[02:37:11.906 --> 02:37:15.228]  Remember when they were melting for like 20 years, but they never actually melted?
[02:37:15.688 --> 02:37:16.548]  That's a slow melt.
[02:37:17.129 --> 02:37:20.751]  Now that I think about it, wow, 25 years, actually, they've been melting.
[02:37:21.445 --> 02:37:22.466]  That's a slow melt.
[02:37:23.526 --> 02:37:23.787]  You know?
[02:37:24.367 --> 02:37:26.048]  I thought China perpetuated COVID.
[02:37:26.509 --> 02:37:26.729]  Hmm.
[02:37:27.189 --> 02:37:27.669]  Interesting.
[02:37:29.010 --> 02:37:31.812]  You know what's really happening in America that's affecting your life right now?
[02:37:32.192 --> 02:37:33.513]  You want to know what's really happening?
[02:37:33.533 --> 02:37:34.794]  Because those are all the distractions.
[02:37:36.415 --> 02:37:38.677]  Medical kidnappings are happening everywhere.
[02:37:39.377 --> 02:37:41.659]  I watched a show, Take Care of Maya.
[02:37:41.959 --> 02:37:42.199]  Wow.
[02:37:42.460 --> 02:37:42.900]  Powerful.
[02:37:43.380 --> 02:37:43.901]  Powerful.
[02:37:44.781 --> 02:37:50.065]  About what the court system and what child protective services can do to families and tear them apart.
[02:37:50.623 --> 02:37:51.484]  That's disgusting.
[02:37:52.244 --> 02:37:53.505]  It's just no due process.
[02:37:54.646 --> 02:37:57.388]  It's one of the sickest things I've seen, honestly.
[02:37:58.629 --> 02:38:00.410]  Imprisonment without trials or evidence.
[02:38:01.651 --> 02:38:02.832]  Loss of property rights.
[02:38:03.452 --> 02:38:05.313]  Your jobs going to robotics.
[02:38:06.394 --> 02:38:10.797]  Filthy, dirty, democratic cities going down the tubes and people trying to flee them.
[02:38:12.358 --> 02:38:13.679]  The looting of America.
[02:38:13.959 --> 02:38:20.184]  The money laundering in all the different departments of America, right?
[02:38:20.928 --> 02:38:23.749]  Including housing, including you name it, NASA.
[02:38:24.049 --> 02:38:28.851]  All deep, dark holes of black funding that you're never gonna ever see again.
[02:38:29.251 --> 02:38:30.512]  Money disappearing, right?
[02:38:32.053 --> 02:38:34.153]  Why are they showcasing tiny homes in America?
[02:38:34.274 --> 02:38:36.514]  They're trying to lower the expectations of the youth.
[02:38:37.175 --> 02:38:37.755]  They really are.
[02:38:38.115 --> 02:38:40.296]  They're trying to say this is the new American dream.
[02:38:40.596 --> 02:38:42.337]  Live in a house that's 200 square feet.
[02:38:43.597 --> 02:38:44.878]  A nasty food supply.
[02:38:45.438 --> 02:38:46.319]  Corrupt judges.
[02:38:47.799 --> 02:38:49.740]  These are the things that are affecting us.
[02:38:50.219 --> 02:38:51.480]  Agenda 30 in cities.
[02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:54.002]  15-minute cities.
[02:38:54.843 --> 02:38:58.186]  These are the things that affect us every single day in America.
[02:38:58.986 --> 02:39:01.348]  Not the distraction, not the squirrel, right?
[02:39:01.449 --> 02:39:01.829]  Squirrel!
[02:39:02.369 --> 02:39:02.850]  Not that.
[02:39:03.911 --> 02:39:04.431]  These things.
[02:39:04.831 --> 02:39:06.613]  These things affect our everyday lives right now.
[02:39:07.253 --> 02:39:09.635]  These are the things that we have to stop.
[02:39:10.276 --> 02:39:13.218]  And we can as a populace if we realize they're going on.
[02:39:13.959 --> 02:39:15.000]  I'll be right back.
[02:39:15.931 --> 02:39:17.072]  on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:39:17.152 --> 02:39:18.894]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host for the hour.
[02:39:19.534 --> 02:39:21.095]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:39:21.135 --> 02:39:24.338]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[02:39:24.398 --> 02:39:25.299]  So happy to be with you.
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:37.009]  So I'm talking kind of overall about the diminishing of the city, the fight that is the strongest is in your local city and community.
[02:39:37.749 --> 02:39:42.994]  Laws, policies, regulations hit your legislators about 20 states at a time.
[02:39:43.663 --> 02:39:48.284]  And you need to realize that because it's actually a pretty brilliant tactic, right?
[02:39:48.404 --> 02:40:03.287]  You can change America by changing the states 20 at a time, 10 at a time, because what they do is they sweep, they write these horrific bills, these UCC code things, and what they do is they attack at the same time.
[02:40:03.567 --> 02:40:07.568]  So nobody really realizes how prevalent it is all through the country.
[02:40:07.848 --> 02:40:10.349]  So 20 states will pass something and go, wow, that was similar.
[02:40:10.956 --> 02:40:14.299]  Or they're getting rid of all the flags across the country.
[02:40:14.779 --> 02:40:17.381]  If you've noticed, it's all cartoon flags now.
[02:40:17.521 --> 02:40:18.702]  They've gotten rid of the seals.
[02:40:19.503 --> 02:40:22.866]  You can't do anything to a flag, usually in each state.
[02:40:23.346 --> 02:40:27.149]  You can't manipulate a flag, make a state flag a pride flag.
[02:40:28.330 --> 02:40:29.671]  You can't manipulate the seal.
[02:40:29.891 --> 02:40:31.493]  But the seals are all leaving.
[02:40:31.713 --> 02:40:37.698]  I don't know if you guys noticed this, but even like Nebraska, it's just a horn on the cob.
[02:40:38.348 --> 02:40:38.888]  On their flag.
[02:40:39.249 --> 02:40:39.889]  I'm not joking.
[02:40:40.310 --> 02:40:41.250]  It's bizarre.
[02:40:41.511 --> 02:40:42.872]  A five-year-old could draw these things.
[02:40:43.992 --> 02:40:47.175]  And so they've diminished the states down to, here's a corncob.
[02:40:48.036 --> 02:40:52.019]  Here's a piece of, I don't know, lint.
[02:40:52.219 --> 02:40:53.820]  We're famous for our lint.
[02:40:54.300 --> 02:40:58.904]  It's a bizarre way to do it and designate the states, but what are they doing?
[02:40:59.024 --> 02:41:00.145]  They're erasing history.
[02:41:00.305 --> 02:41:03.347]  Inside each seal of each flag is a piece of history, actually.
[02:41:03.948 --> 02:41:05.349]  And so it's really sad to see that.
[02:41:06.024 --> 02:41:13.909]  And I tell you this because these are the things that should be in your mind all the time, not the distractions.
[02:41:14.449 --> 02:41:16.650]  Hunter Biden's never going to go down for anything.
[02:41:16.690 --> 02:41:19.932]  He'll be eternally sitting there with his father.
[02:41:22.173 --> 02:41:23.334]  None of that even matters.
[02:41:24.335 --> 02:41:25.395]  This stuff matters, though.
[02:41:26.136 --> 02:41:33.640]  You need to get into the local fight in your local community, and you need to petition the stations to have shows that will expose things.
[02:41:34.482 --> 02:41:38.706]  You know, city lawmakers are now going on trips several times a year to D.C.
[02:41:39.467 --> 02:41:39.687]  Why?
[02:41:39.707 --> 02:41:39.767]  Why?
[02:41:41.148 --> 02:41:45.472]  Why are states going over and promoting global trade with all these countries?
[02:41:46.573 --> 02:41:47.855]  Isn't that our country's job?
[02:41:48.055 --> 02:41:48.795]  Not the state's.
[02:41:49.216 --> 02:41:52.839]  It's really bizarre how much is going on and we don't even see it.
[02:41:53.540 --> 02:41:57.684]  And all of the things that are done to you in your local city and community under the name of tourism.
[02:41:58.737 --> 02:42:01.739]  Taxation, you never see any benefits from all that tourism.
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:06.603]  You never see any benefits, but they'll spend a whole lot of money on it to try to get people there.
[02:42:06.824 --> 02:42:07.704]  You'll just never see it.
[02:42:07.864 --> 02:42:13.669]  You'll just be bombarded by people in your community, but you'll never ever see the benefits of that, actually.
[02:42:14.129 --> 02:42:15.110]  There are a lot of things.
[02:42:15.791 --> 02:42:19.105]   When I looked at the show On medical kidnapping.
[02:42:19.425 --> 02:42:22.986]  It was so sickening that these people never get a voice.
[02:42:23.407 --> 02:42:24.547]  They never get a voice.
[02:42:24.567 --> 02:42:32.011]  Their families are destroyed by one decision, by one monster who's for 30 years has been going after families and seeing abuse.
[02:42:32.311 --> 02:42:35.012]  Kind of like I see dead people, she only sees abuse wherever she goes.
[02:42:35.532 --> 02:42:36.193]  That sort of thing.
[02:42:36.413 --> 02:42:36.693]  Why?
[02:42:36.733 --> 02:42:37.993]  Because there's a lot of money in it.
[02:42:38.374 --> 02:42:39.334]  There's a lot of money in it.
[02:42:40.319 --> 02:42:48.664]  And it's this system whereby the judge always believes the hospitals, they always believe the social workers, and never the families.
[02:42:48.884 --> 02:42:55.328]  And the families have to fight and go bankrupt in order to actually have any justice at all.
[02:42:55.688 --> 02:43:00.991]  They never really get that justice in the end because they never ever come back and get to win a case.
[02:43:01.451 --> 02:43:10.164]   Because when you're in the hospital under a medical kidnapping, You have to sign what's called a case plan in order to end it quickly so you can get out of there, so you can get your child back.
[02:43:10.605 --> 02:43:13.310]  And once you do that, you remove the hospital of all liability.
[02:43:14.116 --> 02:43:21.963]  The other thing going on that people don't talk about is the multi-billion dollar industry and some very evil practices that have been going on in organ donation.
[02:43:21.983 --> 02:43:26.126]  They're in the HIPAA document, and this comes from a friend of mine who's a nurse.
[02:43:26.286 --> 02:43:34.933]  She said, in the HIPAA document we all sign has 14 hidden clauses in there which you have not consented to be an organ donor allows them to get information from you.
[02:43:35.074 --> 02:43:39.998]  In other words, you sign the document to agree to share your medical information with your other providers.
[02:43:40.478 --> 02:43:43.920]  that have relevance to anything about your health.
[02:43:44.260 --> 02:43:52.985]  But these 14 clauses are carefully, cleverly worded, so that includes getting your organs and tissues to extract DNA information.
[02:43:53.726 --> 02:44:02.871]  And all these things that lead to this common practice of saying brain death, but the problem is, are people really brain dead and not recoverable?
[02:44:03.391 --> 02:44:06.233]  So there's a huge industry there that we need to be very, very aware of.
[02:44:06.873 --> 02:44:09.855]  These are the things that affect lives all throughout the country.
[02:44:10.335 --> 02:44:21.640]  Your local city, regulations, fines and policies, what you can do on your lawn and what you can't, how much lawn you can have and how much you can't, what appliances you have to have.
[02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:26.462]  All of these things are affecting all of us right now in every single city in America.
[02:44:26.502 --> 02:44:36.287]  That's how vital and important it is that you fight on the local, just like that northern Idaho town, thousand people now have to show up and say, we don't want more cameras.
[02:44:37.279 --> 02:44:38.940]  We don't need more cameras.
[02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:42.041]  We really don't need them to begin with.
[02:44:43.001 --> 02:44:52.344]  And that is going to be up to the people, because when they stand there in their face and say, you cannot do this, then the odds go up in our favor.
[02:44:52.804 --> 02:44:54.565]  May the odds be in your favor.
[02:44:54.605 --> 02:44:55.965]  Sounds like Hunger Games, doesn't it?
[02:44:56.385 --> 02:44:58.346]  Don't you kind of feel like that's where we're at right now?
[02:44:58.846 --> 02:45:01.327]  It is bizarre what's going on in America right now.
[02:45:02.205 --> 02:45:11.491]  You know, and in a very short time here, we're all going to be enjoying fireworks and barbecues and songs and all of the all of the luxuries of Independence Day.
[02:45:12.352 --> 02:45:13.592]  But what have we done to earn it?
[02:45:14.433 --> 02:45:15.173]  What have we done?
[02:45:15.193 --> 02:45:22.678]  I feel like we're all going to be asked when we when we leave this earth, what did you do for your liberty?
[02:45:23.619 --> 02:45:25.220]  And I think we'll all be held accountable.
[02:45:25.340 --> 02:45:32.612]   And I actually think we'll all have to look back in our lives and examine the moments when you took the piece of silver Right?
[02:45:33.133 --> 02:45:39.537]  And screwed everybody's liberty by a decision that you were presented with, or a responsibility you were given.
[02:45:39.557 --> 02:45:42.840]  And you play that brown shirt.
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:44.341]  You play that piece of the puzzle.
[02:45:44.621 --> 02:45:47.724]  And you say, well, it's only me, and it's only this small piece.
[02:45:48.864 --> 02:45:50.526]  And I really do need this right now.
[02:45:50.966 --> 02:45:51.807]  I need this career.
[02:45:51.827 --> 02:45:52.647]  I need this job.
[02:45:52.707 --> 02:45:53.208]  I need this.
[02:45:53.268 --> 02:45:53.808]  I need that.
[02:45:54.248 --> 02:45:55.089]  And you give it away.
[02:45:55.830 --> 02:46:00.173]  And you give it away, and you say, my future liberty, my future freedom means nothing.
[02:46:01.049 --> 02:46:02.229]  Because that's really what you're saying.
[02:46:02.349 --> 02:46:07.931]  And I think when we go, we're all going to have to reflect back on the moments like that in our life.
[02:46:08.211 --> 02:46:11.052]  Because I'm pretty sure all of us have been presented with moments.
[02:46:12.332 --> 02:46:15.833]  And some of the people that wear the brown shirt don't even know they're wearing it.
[02:46:16.513 --> 02:46:18.253]  They don't even realize they're wearing it.
[02:46:18.513 --> 02:46:19.374]  How crazy is that?
[02:46:20.094 --> 02:46:20.594]  That's insane.
[02:46:21.881 --> 02:46:22.702]  These are the fights.
[02:46:23.022 --> 02:46:23.842]  These are the things.
[02:46:24.342 --> 02:46:24.943]  And you know what?
[02:46:25.383 --> 02:46:28.244]  We have to start fighting this medical cabal.
[02:46:28.425 --> 02:46:29.285]  We've got to do it.
[02:46:29.765 --> 02:46:32.847]  There's so many things right now that are working against us.
[02:46:33.687 --> 02:46:36.369]  And as far as that goes, you know, it's interesting.
[02:46:36.429 --> 02:46:40.151]  A friend of mine's over in Europe right now and they didn't notice any pride.
[02:46:40.891 --> 02:46:42.372]  No pride stuff anywhere.
[02:46:42.512 --> 02:46:43.713]  No pride flags, nothing.
[02:46:44.293 --> 02:46:47.835]  In fact, it was just sort of just normal.
[02:46:49.389 --> 02:46:56.565]  And my friend was so shocked by this that she messaged me from Europe and said, I cannot believe this.
[02:46:57.026 --> 02:46:58.549]  What is going on in our country?
[02:46:59.292 --> 02:47:02.573]  Why do we have an entire month with a flag?
[02:47:03.033 --> 02:47:19.737]  You guys realize flags were there either maritime to distinguish whose ships were whose, but it was your country's symbol and basically a warring symbol really for either, you know, either in war, you knew, you knew, you know, they carried the flags on the horses.
[02:47:19.797 --> 02:47:21.437]  They, they knew who they were fighting.
[02:47:21.477 --> 02:47:23.178]  They knew who the people represented.
[02:47:24.258 --> 02:47:28.139]  And now it's a flag of sexual preference.
[02:47:29.224 --> 02:47:30.605]  Sexual identification.
[02:47:31.386 --> 02:47:32.247]  How perverse is that?
[02:47:32.767 --> 02:47:33.267]  It's sickening.
[02:47:33.948 --> 02:47:36.110]  It's grotesque that we've turned it into that.
[02:47:37.631 --> 02:47:38.972]  Flags used to mean something.
[02:47:39.112 --> 02:47:40.813]  The symbols on them meant something.
[02:47:41.394 --> 02:47:42.335]  And what is it now?
[02:47:43.355 --> 02:47:53.564]  So all this stuff that's affecting you right now, we have to stop looking at the distractions and start really paying attention to what's happening right now.
[02:47:55.065 --> 02:47:57.126]  They also, it was hilarious, I have to mention this.
[02:47:58.559 --> 02:48:04.042]  They were calling it, they always come up with a new term, and this time it is ocean heat wave.
[02:48:05.122 --> 02:48:08.924]  They were trying to say that this was climate change, ocean heat wave.
[02:48:10.105 --> 02:48:19.710]  And the comment section under this article was so hilarious because people that were supposedly affected by this ocean heat wave were saying, yeah, it's pretty okay here.
[02:48:19.850 --> 02:48:20.950]  Yeah, we're actually getting a lot.
[02:48:20.970 --> 02:48:22.191]  I'm not even turning on the air conditioner.
[02:48:22.831 --> 02:48:23.692]  It was hilarious.
[02:48:23.892 --> 02:48:27.914]  And so many people in the comment section saying, this is BS.
[02:48:28.234 --> 02:48:29.214]  No, this is not.
[02:48:29.535 --> 02:48:30.615]  This is ridiculous.
[02:48:30.655 --> 02:48:32.296]  Why are they saying stuff like this?
[02:48:32.336 --> 02:48:34.097]  Why are they coming up with stuff like this?
[02:48:34.157 --> 02:48:35.037]  It's called summer.
[02:48:35.057 --> 02:48:36.618]  And you know what?
[02:48:36.638 --> 02:48:40.360]  I sat there and looked at that comment section and I went, okay, there's hope.
[02:48:41.220 --> 02:48:43.422]  There is hope that we can get through all of this.
[02:48:43.762 --> 02:48:46.023]  That there's enough people that feel the way that you do.
[02:48:46.143 --> 02:48:48.064]  There's enough people in this country that get it.
[02:48:48.964 --> 02:48:49.905]  That we can fight all this.
[02:48:50.939 --> 02:48:52.380]  The entire comment section.
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:56.621]  When I see an entire comment section, go, you know, tell Romney he's a loon.
[02:48:56.881 --> 02:48:57.302]  I love it.
[02:48:57.482 --> 02:48:58.062]  That's awesome.
[02:48:58.382 --> 02:48:58.622]  Good.
[02:48:58.642 --> 02:48:59.663]  It needs to happen.
[02:48:59.783 --> 02:49:01.183]  Be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:49:01.443 --> 02:49:02.083]  Welcome back.
[02:49:02.123 --> 02:49:03.744]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:49:03.844 --> 02:49:06.265]  I'm Kate Dally from katedallyradio.com.
[02:49:06.285 --> 02:49:07.105]  So happy to be with you.
[02:49:07.126 --> 02:49:09.566]  I know this hour just flew, didn't it?
[02:49:09.647 --> 02:49:10.667]  Here we are at the last segment.
[02:49:10.687 --> 02:49:11.907]  I have so much to say, too.
[02:49:12.288 --> 02:49:16.889]  Look, truth tellers are going to always need your financial support.
[02:49:16.929 --> 02:49:26.064]   They're always going to If we don't support the messages, if we don't support the education in this country as a populace, we're sunk.
[02:49:26.785 --> 02:49:28.286]  Freedom of speech goes away, we're sunk.
[02:49:28.906 --> 02:49:30.127]  We are completely sunk.
[02:49:31.047 --> 02:49:32.208]  I hope people realize that.
[02:49:32.829 --> 02:49:33.549]  You must.
[02:49:33.789 --> 02:49:39.412]  It's like the one place, if you're going to put money, put money into messages that can reach far and wide.
[02:49:39.893 --> 02:49:43.355]  Networks, podcasts, all kinds of things that can help, right?
[02:49:44.099 --> 02:49:51.003]  Because we're combating a main, a centrally owned AP and Reuters mainstream media news network.
[02:49:51.423 --> 02:49:52.324]  And it's not a style.
[02:49:52.424 --> 02:49:53.325]  AP is not a style.
[02:49:53.785 --> 02:49:54.785]  It's a content driver.
[02:49:55.306 --> 02:49:56.767]  Tells you how to feel about the stories.
[02:49:57.747 --> 02:50:00.849]  Right now, the Titanic submarine is in the news.
[02:50:01.249 --> 02:50:03.791]  Oddly enough, Elon Musk hasn't made any comments about this.
[02:50:04.660 --> 02:50:07.221]  Um, but I think that's kind of strange to me.
[02:50:07.361 --> 02:50:10.602]  But this story is all over the news, all over the news.
[02:50:10.762 --> 02:50:16.444]  And it's bringing up a lot of stories about the Titanic, because oddly enough, you've got billionaires in this vessel.
[02:50:17.204 --> 02:50:26.647]  And what's strange is we all know the story of Astor, who died, who was the one billionaire holdout, richest man in the world, who did not want central banking in 1913.
[02:50:27.648 --> 02:50:31.649]  When they met on Jekyll Island a year later after the Titanic, he was not for that.
[02:50:32.771 --> 02:50:37.000]  And all of the rich people got off the boat in the boats, right?
[02:50:37.721 --> 02:50:39.245]  So that's what's said.
[02:50:39.786 --> 02:50:40.307]  But he didn't?
[02:50:40.327 --> 02:50:41.088]  Hmm.
[02:50:41.569 --> 02:50:42.752]  Seems a little strange, doesn't it?
[02:50:43.348 --> 02:50:58.442]  So the big story was, of course, the Titanic sunk, and it was the deadliest sinking of a single ship at that time, and that 2,224 people died, or passengers on the crew, and 1,500 died.
[02:50:58.862 --> 02:51:03.746]  There were competing stories, though, in the news at the time, because I have a newspaper archive.
[02:51:03.786 --> 02:51:07.730]  I go back and look at the actual newspaper articles, and they said there were only 1,500 passengers.
[02:51:09.171 --> 02:51:16.216]  And then they said they didn't really know how to count, and then the number went up to 2,224, where 1,500 died.
[02:51:16.396 --> 02:51:17.737]  So that was kind of strange, I thought.
[02:51:18.117 --> 02:51:23.821]  In the very beginning, they said it was 1,500 passengers and 300 crew, and then they went to 2,224, sorry, and 600 crew.
[02:51:23.861 --> 02:51:24.622]  So that was kind of strange.
[02:51:28.817 --> 02:51:38.506]  And also, there was the Twinship Olympic, and they made this Twinship look exactly like it, and both were registered in Liverpool at their home port.
[02:51:38.906 --> 02:51:40.087]  We know these stories, right?
[02:51:40.167 --> 02:51:45.432]  You've probably heard the Carpathia took three days to reach New York after leaving the scene of the disaster.
[02:51:46.650 --> 02:51:55.134]  But that doesn't add up when you saw the article coming out the same, you know, the morning after the Titanic sunk the night before.
[02:51:55.154 --> 02:52:01.176]  And all of a sudden there was this article about the fact that it was being dragged into the harbor.
[02:52:01.396 --> 02:52:07.419]  In fact, this was in the Washington Times and it was a message to the Montreal Star.
[02:52:08.075 --> 02:52:11.838]  And of course it was held afloat by only her water.
[02:52:11.858 --> 02:52:13.799]  This was April 15th of that year, 2012.
[02:52:13.999 --> 02:52:23.006]  Held afloat only by the watertight compartments that great white star liner Titanic is slowly crawling toward this harbor.
[02:52:23.026 --> 02:52:30.411]  Her passengers have been taken off to other vessels only to face a second ordeal and they will again be transferred to the Baltic.
[02:52:30.431 --> 02:52:31.652]  Yada, yada, yada.
[02:52:31.672 --> 02:52:35.815]  The Baltic will take them to their journey's end in New York where they are due next Thursday.
[02:52:36.983 --> 02:52:43.488]  And they talked about it as, they said this, they said, Now, that's kind of an interesting thing when you think about the fact that we're always told it's sunk.
[02:52:43.528 --> 02:52:43.748]  Who knows?
[02:52:43.587 --> 02:52:48.587]   the Titanic, driving along at better than half speed, although in the midst of ice fields
[02:52:48.587 --> 02:52:54.227]   crashed about into the great submerged mountain of ice, which tore away her steel plates."
[02:52:54.227 --> 02:52:58.547]   Now, that's kind of an interesting thing when you think about the fact that we're always
[02:52:58.547 --> 02:52:59.747]  told it's sunk.
[02:52:59.747 --> 02:53:01.188]  Who knows?
[02:53:01.188 --> 02:53:04.188]   And a lot of people go back and they say, "Well, that story was created, but they didn't
[02:53:04.188 --> 02:53:06.067]  know it was another ship coming in."
[02:53:06.067 --> 02:53:07.306]  Okay.
[02:53:08.073 --> 02:53:15.258]  The Carpathia took three days to come in, so I'm not quite sure how that story would come down, and that was strange, right?
[02:53:15.798 --> 02:53:23.383]  But on the 15th, that next morning, this story was printed that that ship did not sink.
[02:53:23.523 --> 02:53:24.244]  Kind of interesting.
[02:53:25.185 --> 02:53:27.206]  But I actually didn't want to concentrate on that.
[02:53:28.075 --> 02:53:31.417]  I actually wanted to concentrate on something else, even though that's pretty intriguing.
[02:53:31.597 --> 02:53:35.139]  And we do know that JP Morgan owned this boat.
[02:53:35.199 --> 02:53:41.622]  JP Morgan and the big instigator of Jekyll Island, we all know that you get rid of your competition, right?
[02:53:41.642 --> 02:53:42.203]  Okay.
[02:53:42.683 --> 02:53:44.564]  But then here's the deal on this.
[02:53:44.884 --> 02:53:47.886]  I actually wanted to present why, what happened.
[02:53:48.186 --> 02:53:53.369]  So if this was nefarious and this went down nefariously, which I do think it did.
[02:53:54.287 --> 02:54:00.269]  I think there were some targets on this boat, and we've seen this again with things like 9-11.
[02:54:00.649 --> 02:54:02.169]  They don't mind collateral damage.
[02:54:02.589 --> 02:54:04.770]  So I'm sure there were a lot of deaths, right?
[02:54:05.410 --> 02:54:05.930]  But why?
[02:54:06.070 --> 02:54:07.710]  You have to ask yourself, I know, but why?
[02:54:07.770 --> 02:54:08.871]  What was to gain out of it?
[02:54:09.591 --> 02:54:16.013]  Well, one of the things that came out of this was the International Convention of the Safety of Life at Sea.
[02:54:16.033 --> 02:54:16.653]  It was passed in 1914.
[02:54:18.676 --> 02:54:23.138]  And this actually kept getting revised, revised, revised, even newly adopted in 1974.
[02:54:23.238 --> 02:54:25.379]  It just kept going and going.
[02:54:26.099 --> 02:54:42.887]  But the disaster actually led to the formation and international funding of the International Ice Patrol, the agency of the United States Coast Guard that is present day monitors and reports on the location of North Atlantic Ocean icebergs that could pose a threat, right?
[02:54:43.187 --> 02:54:44.928]  So I'm sure right now you're going, well, that's good.
[02:54:45.208 --> 02:54:45.848]  That's really good.
[02:54:45.868 --> 02:54:46.548]  I mean, why not?
[02:54:46.668 --> 02:54:46.848]  Right?
[02:54:48.493 --> 02:54:56.281]  What's really kind of interesting about this is that the ice patrol has worked each season since 1913, that pivotal date.
[02:54:56.942 --> 02:55:01.226]  And during that period, they said there has not been a single reported loss of life.
[02:55:01.907 --> 02:55:10.656]  The problem with that story is that we came over here on boats endlessly and we did not have loss of life at every single turn as far as hitting icebergs.
[02:55:11.445 --> 02:55:13.607]  So the Titanic Iceberg, was it used?
[02:55:13.767 --> 02:55:18.512]  Was it used for the reason to move in for the International Ice Patrol?
[02:55:19.212 --> 02:55:27.680]  And also there were 13 nations, 13 again, that's kind of crazy, interested in this transatlantic navigation program.
[02:55:28.341 --> 02:55:34.346]  All of the main players that you could probably imagine that all sign up and meet together, even currently.
[02:55:34.787 --> 02:55:40.511]   But what's interesting about this is that it was really also about surveillance.
[02:55:41.051 --> 02:55:44.894]  We were given the role of conducting the surveillance.
[02:55:45.434 --> 02:55:52.800]  The ships, the weight of the ships, the regulations for the weight of the ships, what's on the ships, you name it, patrolled by us.
[02:55:53.942 --> 02:55:55.663]  Now maybe you still don't think that's a big deal.
[02:55:55.683 --> 02:56:09.875]  I think something's a little shady about the fact that we were using the Titanic and the fallout of the Titanic, the summary of the Titanic, was to create this organization, right?
[02:56:10.435 --> 02:56:19.202]  And then they also, the Revenue Cutter Service, that was the forerunner to the United States Coast Guard, assumed all the responsibility for this.
[02:56:20.345 --> 02:56:32.732]  And then, of course, the first International Conference of the Safety of Sea Life was convened in London, conveniently, and we were invited to undertake the management of the entire series.
[02:56:33.653 --> 02:56:41.057]  So then it became SOLAS, S-O-L-A-S, and that turned into the UN International Maritime Treaty.
[02:56:41.795 --> 02:56:42.015]  Hmm.
[02:56:42.595 --> 02:56:48.558]  This organization is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for regulating shipping.
[02:56:48.918 --> 02:56:52.179]  All of this came from the sinking of the, or not sinking, of the Titanic.
[02:56:52.960 --> 02:56:53.980]  That's kind of interesting.
[02:56:54.660 --> 02:57:01.383]  The IMO, this group, was established following an agreement UN conference held in Geneva in 1948.
[02:57:02.384 --> 02:57:07.226]   And of course all the member states are involved and Let me give you this.
[02:57:08.306 --> 02:57:11.808]  Now, this is all about environmental issues.
[02:57:12.249 --> 02:57:26.097]  In fact, the goal at hand from 1973 on, with climate change agenda at hand, was to develop an international agreement for controlling environmental contamination by ships when out at sea.
[02:57:27.057 --> 02:57:33.681]  During the next few years, the IMO brought to the forefront the series of measures designed to prevent large ship accidents.
[02:57:34.301 --> 02:57:37.741]   That's sort of the It's kind of like Planned Parenthood saying they're healthcare.
[02:57:37.761 --> 02:57:40.824]  That's like the small part of what they do.
[02:57:40.844 --> 02:57:49.234]  The bigger part of what they will be doing and controlling are ships at sea, what they have on them, and are they environmentally okay?
[02:57:50.518 --> 02:58:00.845]  So wouldn't that also lend to a lot of ships not being able to sail for total control over the entire shipping industry for environmental purposes?
[02:58:01.365 --> 02:58:08.369]  We've talked on the show about the fact that climate lockdowns are coming, and that is very true.
[02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:10.070]  That's what 15-minute cities are for.
[02:58:10.391 --> 02:58:15.474]  They are to control our footprint so that we can only go so far, and we have to go get permits to go so far.
[02:58:16.628 --> 02:58:19.433]  Think about this in the shipping of things.
[02:58:19.613 --> 02:58:21.236]  Think about this.
[02:58:21.737 --> 02:58:23.400]  What's going on with the shipping?
[02:58:23.660 --> 02:58:25.243]  Because we rely on shipping, don't we?
[02:58:27.731 --> 02:58:32.895]  I heard Walmart was dropping a lot of their shares recently, and that's kind of an interesting story.
[02:58:32.915 --> 02:58:40.301]  Maybe we'll attack that next time, but Walmart dropping their shares and a lot having to do with China and shipping and all kinds of things.
[02:58:40.741 --> 02:58:46.446]  So I wonder how many environmental factors now will be the only objective of the IMO.
[02:58:47.226 --> 02:58:50.369]  And all of this came about because of the Titanic.
[02:58:51.343 --> 02:58:56.525]  There's always some catastrophe and then they offer up their solution and they offer up measures.
[02:58:56.645 --> 02:58:58.186]  We never needed these measures before.
[02:58:59.146 --> 02:59:02.467]  And somehow all of our relatives got over here.
[02:59:02.487 --> 02:59:03.028]  Hmm.
[02:59:03.148 --> 02:59:03.888]  How did that happen?
[02:59:04.548 --> 02:59:05.669]  It makes one wonder, doesn't it?
[02:59:06.529 --> 02:59:10.751]  And so when we think about the fallout of the Titanic, what happened because of the Titanic?
[02:59:11.611 --> 02:59:12.191]  Oh, that's easy.
[02:59:12.871 --> 02:59:15.853]  It's just a whole lot of control from the UN.
[02:59:16.733 --> 02:59:19.843]   Again, These are the kinds of things we have to look at.
[02:59:20.023 --> 02:59:21.344]  These are the things we need to know about.
[02:59:22.344 --> 02:59:24.304]  Because this is what's going to control things.
[02:59:24.644 --> 02:59:27.905]  Get local, have a farm, do all of those things.
[02:59:28.365 --> 02:59:30.085]  I'm Kate Dally for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:30.485 --> 02:59:31.525]  You guys have a great day.
[02:59:31.585 --> 02:59:32.465]  Think about locally.
[02:59:32.284 --> 02:59:34.284]  That's where we need to concentrate efforts.
[02:59:34.284 --> 02:59:46.684]   Well, as we warned you would happen, the Deep State, the former UN prosecutor,
[02:59:46.684 --> 02:59:47.684]  here.
[02:59:47.762 --> 02:59:51.985]  has indicted President Trump for having documents presidents are legally allowed to have.
[02:59:52.445 --> 02:59:53.566]  They're coming after everybody.
[02:59:54.707 --> 02:59:58.929]  But the good news is humanity is waking up now more than ever and is seeing through this.
[02:59:59.790 --> 03:00:07.135]  The globalist's only hope is to censor and to silence and to shut down voices like myself, Tucker Carlson and others who tell the truth.
[03:00:07.635 --> 03:00:10.237]  That's why your word of mouth about the broadcast is so key.
[03:00:11.084 --> 03:00:16.629]  That's why you sharing the articles, the videos, and clips of the show is so incredible, and you've been doing it, and you know you are.
[03:00:17.090 --> 03:00:18.191]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[03:00:19.112 --> 03:00:25.698]  But I want to encourage listeners to not just spread the word about the show, but to also pray for the broadcast, and pray for other people that are exposing the globalists.
[03:00:26.399 --> 03:00:36.515]   And at the same time, also get great products at InfoWarsTore.com that fund our operation, that keep us on the air, Because we're sponsored by viewers and listeners like you, not by George Soros.

[03:01:06.175 --> 03:01:07.217]  RainForce Ultra.

[03:01:10.620 --> 03:01:11.341]  That's why I love it.
[03:01:11.581 --> 03:01:21.031]  If I have to stay up late at night, I don't want to take a supplement like RainForce Plus or RainForce TurboForce, because that's 5, 6, 10 hours of energy.
[03:01:21.721 --> 03:01:27.646]  RainForce Ultra is amazingly clean, fast-acting, kicks in in 15-20 minutes, only lasts 2-3 hours.

[03:01:42.315 --> 03:01:45.137]  And now that brings me to these little babies right here.

[03:02:06.208 --> 03:02:08.569]  Then we've got Probiotic Formula.
[03:02:08.930 --> 03:02:11.311]  It's been over three years since we offered a probiotic.
[03:02:11.613 --> 03:02:13.254]  Because I'll only sell the highest quality.
[03:02:13.594 --> 03:02:16.976]  And the company we were using, they had an amazing one, got bought out by leftists.
[03:02:17.257 --> 03:02:18.778]  And they said, no business with you.
[03:02:19.158 --> 03:02:22.220]  I finally got a good company that has high ratings, that I trust.
[03:02:22.580 --> 03:02:23.701]  I've been using it for several months.
[03:02:23.981 --> 03:02:24.661]  Now it's available.
[03:02:24.961 --> 03:02:26.022]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:02:26.322 --> 03:02:29.524]  Probiotic formula from Infowars, MD.
[03:02:29.925 --> 03:02:31.846]  And then, Prostate Support.
[03:02:32.566 --> 03:02:34.227]  So again, this is apples and oranges.
[03:02:34.668 --> 03:02:35.508]  Different formulas.
[03:02:35.568 --> 03:02:36.529]  Both have a great effect.
[03:02:36.809 --> 03:02:38.350]  This is not competing with Prostagard.
[03:02:38.670 --> 03:02:39.831]  But it's an amazing formula.
[03:02:40.151 --> 03:02:43.994]  Prostate support from InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:02:47.737 --> 03:02:49.259]  Joint Relief Max.

[03:02:51.500 --> 03:02:52.541]  We're able to private label.

[03:02:59.907 --> 03:03:01.268]  Nerve Renew.
[03:03:01.788 --> 03:03:04.971]  So many nerves don't have the vitamins and minerals and trace elements they need.
[03:03:05.276 --> 03:03:07.739]  So they're agitated, they're out of control.
