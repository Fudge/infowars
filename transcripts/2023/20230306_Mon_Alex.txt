[00:00:05.257 --> 00:00:06.197]  It's Monday, March 6, 2023.
[00:00:06.197 --> 00:00:11.499]  We've got a big broadcast coming on at 3 today.
[00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:17.121]  Michael Malice and more in the studio.
[00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.241]  InfoWars.
[00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:19.422]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:19.422 --> 00:00:19.802]  Today.
[00:00:27.145 --> 00:00:32.207]  We have got a transmission for you today.
[00:00:32.207 --> 00:00:36.488]  I've done a lot of research and a lot of work and I'm loaded for bear.
[00:00:36.488 --> 00:00:40.809]  We have massive escalation in war with Russia and China.
[00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:48.211]  We have new documents coming out that Fauci directly blocked the fact that the virus came out of the Wuhan lab.
[00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:54.233]  We have the UK government documents confirmed public, they're not denying it, that they said we're going to release a new variant.
[00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:59.992]  To terrorize the public into submission to collapse the economy.
[00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:04.496]  We have got the left's attempt at race war going into high gear.
[00:01:04.496 --> 00:01:12.724]  We've got a bunch of studies old and new on 5G causing cancer and some video demonstrations of it.
[00:01:12.724 --> 00:01:19.671]  We have the Biden administration make stunning admission on climate change in leaked memo.
[00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:27.472]  That they do not want, quote, greater energy security and want to cut off the American people's energy.
[00:01:27.472 --> 00:01:30.614]  Their policy is to cut off our energy.
[00:01:30.614 --> 00:01:34.235]  Now we can look at the policy in form and in function.
[00:01:34.235 --> 00:01:36.216]  We don't need to have a leaked memo to know that.
[00:01:36.216 --> 00:01:43.200]  But it's also nice to know that it's premeditated and it's confirmed and they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.262]  But as Alexander Shultz and Eason said, they know that we know.
[00:01:49.262 --> 00:01:50.143]  We know that they know.
[00:01:51.513 --> 00:01:54.055]  We all know, but they still deny it.
[00:01:54.055 --> 00:02:06.963]  I kind of butchered that, but you guys pull up the actual Alexander Shultz and Eason quote about, we know, they know that we know, and it just goes on perfectly to describe how it works to live inside an authoritarian totalitarian system.
[00:02:06.963 --> 00:02:10.005]  It's just over the top wild.
[00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:18.411]  Also, not just Walmart, but other major chains are closing stores in major cities around the country because the crime is so horrible they're losing money in them.
[00:02:19.758 --> 00:02:23.779]  But big corporations are willing to do that because they want to break the average person as well.
[00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:29.901]  So even when big box stores can't make it, you know, the general public really can't as well.
[00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:37.664]  Got a big stack of news on replacement migration, where the left, out of one side of their mouth, here and in Europe, say, white people are bad, we want to get rid of them.
[00:02:37.664 --> 00:02:42.025]  But then if you say, hey, you've got these memos and statements at UN plans that white people are bad.
[00:02:42.025 --> 00:02:42.626]  Oh, no, we don't.
[00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:43.286]  You're insane.
[00:02:43.286 --> 00:02:45.967]  We're gonna try to pass laws to arrest you.
[00:02:46.587 --> 00:02:50.631]  Well, they have passed them in Europe and the UK and Canada, if you say that.
[00:02:50.631 --> 00:03:06.448]  But it's not just the Democrats that are doing that, like in Washington State, their Attorney General's introduced a bill for the Ministry of Truth, which targets conservatives opposing election fraud and vaccine mandates would make them a crime.
[00:03:06.448 --> 00:03:08.770]  He actually says it in the video, but it gets worse.
[00:03:09.651 --> 00:03:21.474]  We have Florida GOP, a senior member of DeSantis' support group, declares war on First Amendment to combat anti-Semitism.
[00:03:21.474 --> 00:03:24.194]  He says you will spend jail time for your free speech.
[00:03:24.194 --> 00:03:32.576]  So the silver lining of DeSantis, the shine, is really wearing off of him in many ways.
[00:03:32.576 --> 00:03:34.797]  And that's not because I think Trump's perfecter either.
[00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:36.457]  I'm just going to cover the facts of
[00:03:37.742 --> 00:03:41.923]  We can see tyranny from the right wing, not just the left wing as well.
[00:03:41.923 --> 00:03:44.224]  We don't just mindlessly defend the right wing here.
[00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.625]  In fact, I would even call myself right wing at the end of the day.
[00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:54.268]  I'm a pro-human, common sense, pro-family, pro-God, pro-self-defense, pro-America, populist.
[00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:59.869]  So all of this and more are coming up today.
[00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:06.992]  And hey, when the Biden administration does something positive, which is very rare, I'll be the first to talk about it.
[00:04:08.283 --> 00:04:18.362]  And in a major twist, EPA chief warns Ohio parents to not drink the water and to filter their water.
[00:04:20.776 --> 00:04:22.498]  Now that seems like common sense to do.
[00:04:22.498 --> 00:04:32.547]  Most major water supplies are contaminated with bisphenol A and atrazine and stuff that will literally shrivel your testicles up and turn you into a eunuch and give you cancer.
[00:04:32.547 --> 00:04:33.769]  But they'll never say that.
[00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:34.850]  Oh no, the water is safe.
[00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.352]  Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist, never filled with water.
[00:04:37.352 --> 00:04:39.474]  But more and more they're like, yeah, you should fill it with water.
[00:04:39.474 --> 00:04:42.917]  Wow, something good and truthful from these people.
[00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:44.099]  It is possible.
[00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:46.788]  Wow!
[00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:51.916]  Remember David Hogg attacked me on C-SPAN for the conspiracy theory that you should filter your water in most areas.
[00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:57.846]  At least check from the local water test and almost everywhere the water is poisonous.
[00:04:57.846 --> 00:04:58.587]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.587 --> 00:04:59.007]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.758 --> 00:05:13.711]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsaw.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[00:05:13.711 --> 00:05:18.036]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in
[00:05:18.616 --> 00:05:22.037]  Many of you for years have never gone to InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:05:48.121 --> 00:05:49.882]  Plus, you're missing out on these products.
[00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:58.787]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:15.547]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:15.547 --> 00:06:17.871]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.256 --> 00:06:34.317]  It's Monday, March 6, 2023.
[00:06:34.317 --> 00:06:38.499]  I am your host, Alex Jones, very honored and blessed to be here.
[00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:45.462]  I want to thank you all for tuning in and sharing the transmission that overrides the censors and the tyrants.
[00:06:45.462 --> 00:06:58.969]  All right, a really great researcher and author and popular podcaster and a guy I've been interviewing, hard to believe, for more than 10 years, Michael Malice, now a fellow Austinite, moved here from New York to escape the lockdowns, is going to be in studio with us in the second
[00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:07.950]  And third hour, Paul Watson will also be visiting to talk about this first big story we're going to hit.
[00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.950]  Now this broke on Friday in the London Telegraph.
[00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:26.776]  Now it's all over the world news and they've admitted that, yes indeed, a hundred thousand of his private messages to himself and the rest of the government ministers from WhatsApp were hacked.
[00:07:29.054 --> 00:07:33.177]  And it is full of criminal activity.
[00:07:33.177 --> 00:07:43.703]  It's him talking to the Prime Minister, him talking to the other agencies, him talking to their Ministry of Defense about how to scare the public and use, quote, mind control on them.
[00:07:43.703 --> 00:07:49.926]  The media tried to focus mainly on him cheating on his wife in the text messages, but that hasn't worked.
[00:07:49.926 --> 00:07:55.590]  They talk about deploying a new variant to, quote, scare the pants off of everyone.
[00:07:57.793 --> 00:08:00.274]  And they said we should just go ahead and ban everything.
[00:08:00.274 --> 00:08:03.474]  That sounds more legitimate than only banning a few things.
[00:08:03.474 --> 00:08:11.196]  It is a keyhole view into the seedy underworld of fear-mongering and mind control.
[00:08:11.196 --> 00:08:21.278]  And you notice the rhetoric coming out of his mouth is the exact same the US government, the German government, the Canadian government, the Australian government, the Dutch government, the French government, the Italian government.
[00:08:22.628 --> 00:08:30.916]  It's the same garbage coming out of the Spanish government because it was a unified worldwide corporate UN assault.
[00:08:30.916 --> 00:08:40.506]  The UK lockdown files, text messages are real, how top British health officials conspired to quote scare the pants off everyone and asking when do we deploy the new variant.
[00:08:41.633 --> 00:08:47.175]  Now we know they cooked it up in a lab, but I believe there they're talking about deploying the hype of a new variant.
[00:08:47.175 --> 00:08:48.716]  Project Fear.
[00:08:48.716 --> 00:08:51.737]  Authors discuss when to deploy the new COVID variant.
[00:08:51.737 --> 00:08:53.558]  London Telegraph.
[00:08:53.558 --> 00:09:02.222]  And now suddenly there are prominent members of Congress and governors and foreign leaders and you name it.
[00:09:03.578 --> 00:09:23.228]  Bill Maher, Russell Brand, Joe Rogan, coming out against the New World Order, coming out against the globalists, coming out against the big corporations, coming out against Bill Gates, and point of the elephant in the room, you can go back 20 years where Bill Gates got banned in India, his dad.
[00:09:23.228 --> 00:09:31.733]  You can go back a decade when Bill Gates got banned in Kenya and other African countries because they caught them adding sterilants to the vaccines.
[00:09:32.827 --> 00:09:34.288]  Different ways they do it.
[00:09:34.288 --> 00:09:47.394]  But one thing is, with a tetanus shot, they add a certain key female hormone that's only produced at the beginning of the second trimester, and then it causes an autoimmune response, and the body attacks the baby at the second trimester and kills it.
[00:09:47.394 --> 00:09:51.196]  Bill Gates got caught doing that, really, 15, 16 years ago.
[00:09:51.196 --> 00:09:56.679]  You can look up, UN caught adding steroids to vaccines, Kenya, and Bill Gates was behind it.
[00:09:57.881 --> 00:10:11.926]  Just like he was behind six years ago getting caught in Africa and in Central Asia, places like Pakistan, giving children live polio on purpose, causing polio outbreaks.
[00:10:11.926 --> 00:10:13.447]  You ask, how does he do it?
[00:10:13.447 --> 00:10:14.667]  Well, that's the question.
[00:10:14.667 --> 00:10:19.569]  He's practicing through the media that he spends billions of dollars of tax money.
[00:10:19.569 --> 00:10:22.830]  He really gets all this grant money and puts his own money in tax-exempt.
[00:10:23.697 --> 00:10:32.021]  And then pays himself back profits from the vaccines we all are basically forced to take or much of us are forced to take.
[00:10:32.021 --> 00:10:35.803]  And he goes around then testing to see how many people he can kill.
[00:10:35.803 --> 00:10:45.648]  Well, he got away with the tetanus shots that were Trojan horses for infertility and automatic miscarriages.
[00:10:45.648 --> 00:10:50.531]  And he got away with spreading polio around the world in the vaccines.
[00:10:50.531 --> 00:10:50.931]  And so
[00:10:53.032 --> 00:10:55.753]  Now he's going to get away, he thinks, with the COVID shots.
[00:10:55.753 --> 00:11:01.276]  And notice the amount of death is going up and up and up and up and up and up and up each time.
[00:11:01.276 --> 00:11:05.558]  So Joe Rogan last week had Russell Brand in studio.
[00:11:05.558 --> 00:11:12.681]  And they brought up the fact that I was on Joe's show a few years ago and said, you know, Bill Gates got caught adding polio to the vaccines.
[00:11:12.681 --> 00:11:13.802]  He got banned in a bunch of countries.
[00:11:13.802 --> 00:11:15.802]  And Joe went, hold on just a second.
[00:11:15.802 --> 00:11:16.583]  Let's search that.
[00:11:16.583 --> 00:11:17.563]  And Joe had never seen that.
[00:11:17.563 --> 00:11:18.844]  There it was in AP and Reuters.
[00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:23.053]  And he went, oh my God, it's true, and he did a bunch of research on it.
[00:11:23.053 --> 00:11:27.877]  But the reason I mention that is because it's a window into the mindset of these people.
[00:11:27.877 --> 00:11:35.442]  It's all a test with successful approximation to increase the level of the attack and to be able to get away with it.
[00:11:35.442 --> 00:11:38.805]  That's why it's so critical to finally nail them for this.
[00:11:38.805 --> 00:11:48.372]  And we have in the court of public opinion, the coverage of them being behind the COVID bug and behind the poison shots is a million times, literally.
[00:11:49.727 --> 00:12:02.709]  Bigger than the attention they got for Kenya, and bigger for the attention that they got around the world with the tainted Trojan horse polio injections.
[00:12:02.709 --> 00:12:03.590]  So they're not happy.
[00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.470]  This didn't go well because of independent media.
[00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.031]  That's why they're trying to pass laws, and have in Europe.
[00:12:10.031 --> 00:12:16.932]  They're trying to pass them here, and we've got news on that, we'll be getting to, to literally shut down
[00:12:18.217 --> 00:12:22.718]  And arrest anyone that questions any of the poison injections they roll out.
[00:12:22.718 --> 00:12:29.601]  Even though everything they said about the poison injections was a lie, everything we said was true.
[00:12:29.601 --> 00:12:40.744]  But this lie, this eugenics operation, this depopulation operation cannot thrive, cannot survive, cannot operate if we are here exposing them.
[00:12:41.613 --> 00:12:43.694]  So we have nothing to lose.
[00:12:43.694 --> 00:12:45.276]  All we can do is fight.
[00:12:45.276 --> 00:12:46.737]  When we fight back, things get better.
[00:12:46.737 --> 00:12:49.279]  When we roll over, things get successively worse.
[00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:50.740]  So, I saw this headline.
[00:12:52.082 --> 00:13:06.253]  And I knew instantly what the story was about and I went and read it in detail and sure enough it's a great article from NewsPunch.com and it goes over the history of the Gates Foundation caught with abortion drugs and depopulate and even members of his own team later admitting it.
[00:13:06.253 --> 00:13:13.859]  It's a nice boil down of what happened in the mid-90s through the mid-2000s all over Africa.
[00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:18.443]  Gates Foundation insider admits COVID vaccines are abortion drugs to depopulate the world.
[00:13:19.289 --> 00:13:29.258]  And you read the article and it's full of links and quotes to where it actually happened and how the WHO even had to admit that, okay, we sterilized millions of people in Africa with these shots.
[00:13:29.258 --> 00:13:32.821]  And again, you can try to argue that, well, we should sterilize people.
[00:13:32.821 --> 00:13:34.362]  Do you want to be sterilized?
[00:13:34.362 --> 00:13:36.444]  Do you want this guy to have the power over you to do that?
[00:13:36.444 --> 00:13:40.107]  Because it's wink, wink, hey, let's kill the Africans.
[00:13:40.107 --> 00:13:40.988]  Well, what about you?
[00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:45.352]  See, don't pretend like the new world order isn't coming after you.
[00:13:45.352 --> 00:13:46.913]  You can be a billionaire and they're coming after you.
[00:13:48.083 --> 00:13:49.798]  Let's play the Club at Russell Brand on Joe Rogan.
[00:13:51.881 --> 00:13:53.763]  Bill Gates ain't Willy Wonka.
[00:13:53.763 --> 00:13:55.784]  He ain't doing this for, like, a competition.
[00:13:55.784 --> 00:13:57.705]  There's no golden ticket at the end of this.
[00:13:57.705 --> 00:14:12.696]  It's like, yeah, not-for-profit organizations making profit, an incredible amount of influence in areas that he profits from, all sorts of peculiar business practices, like in India and on the continent of Africa, that have led to, like, palpable suffering and profit in his case.
[00:14:12.696 --> 00:14:17.820]  The Africa thing is wild, and that's a big part of this, uh, the Real Anthony Fauci book.
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:26.626]  He talks about Bill Gates quite a bit, and one of the things he talks about is how they've always used Africa as a place where they test out medicines.
[00:14:26.626 --> 00:14:31.129]  They've used Africa as a place where they test out... This is another thing that I learned from Alex Jones.
[00:14:31.129 --> 00:14:39.955]  Alex Jones was saying that they were giving kids the polio vaccine in Africa, and that Bill Gates was involved in this, and they had to stop doing it because it was actually giving kids polio.
[00:14:39.955 --> 00:14:40.735]  And I was like, what?
[00:14:41.836 --> 00:14:43.997]  And they pull up an AP article.
[00:14:43.997 --> 00:14:53.383]  There was an AP story about this, and it shows this terrified little African baby, and they're dropping the polio vaccine in his mouth, like, squeezing his face, dropping his mouth.
[00:14:53.383 --> 00:14:55.644]  I'm like, what the f***, man?
[00:14:55.644 --> 00:14:58.886]  They gave kids polio with a vaccine?
[00:15:00.047 --> 00:15:11.376]  Even when you accept everything that they say, at this late point when it appears impossible to do that, they wouldn't release patents so that African nations could recreate the vaccines over there.
[00:15:11.376 --> 00:15:17.040]  So clearly there's a profit motive, and I saw him publicly talk about that and say, oh no, it's not as simple as that, you can't just give people the patents and stuff like that.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:28.329]  But it seems like if you recognise that what drives them always is power, finance and dominion, if you always look at that and then track their actions, you hardly ever see a disruption in that pattern.
[00:15:30.655 --> 00:15:38.801]  And if you try to think about all the evil things in 45 years Fauci's quarterbacked, and he's part of a big eugenics society and works for Bill Gates, it'll make your head spin.
[00:15:38.801 --> 00:15:47.348]  Remember in the 80s and 90s, thousands of foster children taken in New York alone and who were healthy and given AIDS drugs till they died.
[00:15:47.348 --> 00:15:48.589]  That's Fauci again.
[00:15:48.589 --> 00:15:53.813]  Or taking German shepherds and beagles and paralyzing and letting flesh-eating bugs eat their faces off.
[00:15:53.813 --> 00:15:54.914]  That's Fauci.
[00:15:54.914 --> 00:15:56.395]  If it's evil, he's doing it.
[00:15:56.395 --> 00:15:57.516]  He's Joseph Mingle at 2.0.
[00:15:57.516 --> 00:15:58.437]  Be right back.
[00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:08.582]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the Globals in their own words, planned for our future.
[00:16:08.582 --> 00:16:10.023]  That is a hellish future.
[00:16:10.023 --> 00:16:19.449]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarshore.com.
[00:16:19.449 --> 00:16:25.033]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:16:25.033 --> 00:16:27.015]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:16:27.595 --> 00:16:32.977]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHore.com.
[00:16:32.977 --> 00:16:36.918]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:16:36.918 --> 00:16:42.799]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:16:42.799 --> 00:16:44.880]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.400]  I've got some good news.
[00:17:02.006 --> 00:17:08.889]  Our high-quality supplements really work, and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[00:17:08.889 --> 00:17:09.709]  That's the good news.
[00:17:09.709 --> 00:17:10.849]  They're amazing.
[00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:19.032]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to InfoWareStore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[00:17:19.032 --> 00:17:22.474]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the InfoWare.
[00:17:22.474 --> 00:17:27.395]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[00:17:27.395 --> 00:17:28.236]  Think what would happen.
[00:17:29.156 --> 00:17:42.685]  If those of you on the fence actually went to InfoWarStore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects, so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[00:17:42.685 --> 00:17:51.651]  Also, we've got the super high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones as well.
[00:17:51.651 --> 00:17:53.032]  Or Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:17:53.032 --> 00:17:57.455]  Just go try the product, fund the InfoWar, and help us defeat the New World Order together.
[00:17:57.455 --> 00:17:58.776]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:17:59.977 --> 00:18:02.701]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[00:18:02.701 --> 00:18:07.566]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[00:18:07.566 --> 00:18:12.893]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[00:18:12.893 --> 00:18:14.735]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully
[00:18:14.935 --> 00:18:23.623]  To go to InfoWarStore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.

[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.522]  Some of the very best products.
[00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:45.664]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWarsTore.
[00:18:45.664 --> 00:18:50.989]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWarsTore.
[00:18:50.989 --> 00:18:53.871]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[00:18:53.871 --> 00:18:55.213]  Plus, they keep us on air.
[00:18:55.213 --> 00:18:56.734]  So again, please take action.
[00:18:56.734 --> 00:19:00.858]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com today, and I thank you.
[00:19:00.858 --> 00:19:02.259]  InfoWars.
[00:19:02.259 --> 00:19:04.281]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:19:04.281 --> 00:19:05.102]  This is their big move.
[00:19:06.013 --> 00:19:09.794]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[00:19:09.794 --> 00:19:11.515]  He doesn't care.
[00:19:11.515 --> 00:19:12.755]  That's not his job.
[00:19:12.755 --> 00:19:14.515]  He's not the president of the United States.
[00:19:14.515 --> 00:19:18.376]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[00:19:18.376 --> 00:19:22.858]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[00:19:22.858 --> 00:19:23.978]  They must be opposed.
[00:19:24.745 --> 00:19:28.027]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[00:19:28.027 --> 00:19:29.208]  No.
[00:19:29.208 --> 00:19:30.049]  No.
[00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:30.809]  No.
[00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:31.710]  Exactly.
[00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.273]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[00:19:35.273 --> 00:19:38.375]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[00:19:38.375 --> 00:19:40.857]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[00:19:40.857 --> 00:19:43.358]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[00:19:43.358 --> 00:19:46.981]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:49.503]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[00:19:49.503 --> 00:19:49.903]  You're right.
[00:19:50.183 --> 00:19:54.926]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[00:19:54.926 --> 00:20:01.370]  And we say no to your war!
[00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:05.993]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:05.993 --> 00:20:07.274]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:45.490]  Alright, we're talking about something really important and that's your right to listen to what you want to listen to, to watch what you want to watch, to read what you want to watch.
[00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:51.999]  That's what all the surveillance and censorship is about, is controlling your mind and your ability to make good decisions.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:21:09.884]  In Europe, in the UK, they've passed laws, Australia's done it as well, to criminalize free speech, criminalize speaking out against open borders, election fraud, forced injections, and notice our Justice Department came out two years ago, run by Biden, and said the same thing.
[00:21:09.884 --> 00:21:22.247]  White supremacy is the number one threat, and then defined in that June report a year and a half ago, two years ago, that it's anybody questioning open borders, stolen elections, lockdowns, or forced shots.
[00:21:23.194 --> 00:21:25.215]  You are a white supremacist.
[00:21:25.215 --> 00:21:30.599]  And then by that definition, with hate crime laws, then you get higher penalties for things that would be misdemeanors.
[00:21:30.599 --> 00:21:32.860]  I'll explain that in a moment.
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:39.505]  But it's a formulated plan, all over the Western world, run by the same people.
[00:21:39.505 --> 00:21:42.106]  So, here's an article on the Gateway Pundit.
[00:21:42.106 --> 00:21:43.668]  You can go read a copy of the legislation.
[00:21:43.668 --> 00:21:44.208]  It's linked to it.
[00:21:45.382 --> 00:21:54.946]  State Attorney General pushing Ministry of Truth bill which targets conservatives opposing election fraud and vaccine mandates could become crimes.
[00:21:54.946 --> 00:22:02.869]  Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson is pushing the state legislature to adopt legislation that would set up a commission on domestic terrorism.
[00:22:02.869 --> 00:22:04.610]  See, it's terror!
[00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:12.613]  That mirrors Biden's policy according to a report that could lead to a conservative individual being criminally charged for expressing their views.
[00:22:12.613 --> 00:22:13.494]  And it goes on.
[00:22:15.771 --> 00:22:27.820]  And KTTH TV reporting on it, HB 1333, sets up a domestic violent extremist commission, and then they will decide, the commission, what is a crime, not the legislature.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.001]  Absolutely insane.
[00:22:29.001 --> 00:22:30.222]  HB 1333.
[00:22:30.222 --> 00:22:35.607]  Now, you're thinking, well that's the crazies in Washington.
[00:22:35.607 --> 00:22:39.229]  No, no, no, no, no, no!
[00:22:39.229 --> 00:22:44.433]  We saw Greg Abbott a year and a half ago come out and say, I'm pro-free speech, but if it's anti-Semitic,
[00:22:45.202 --> 00:22:48.008]  We want you banned.
[00:22:48.008 --> 00:22:50.012]  Anti-Semitic.
[00:22:50.012 --> 00:22:56.104]  You can have the left running around everywhere at the universities on TV singing, Christians are evil, whites are evil, America's evil.
[00:22:57.647 --> 00:23:00.528]  Oh, but if people want to say Jews are bad, you're not allowed to.
[00:23:00.528 --> 00:23:03.029]  You should be able to say any group's bad you want.
[00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:04.569]  That's your First Amendment.
[00:23:04.569 --> 00:23:07.490]  Doesn't mean I support what somebody's saying, doesn't mean you support it.
[00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:18.473]  And again, it always starts with, don't say the N-word, don't attack Jews, and the next is don't criticize open borders or election fraud or forced injections, which they're now doing.
[00:23:18.473 --> 00:23:21.794]  Florida GOP declares war on the First Amendment.
[00:23:21.794 --> 00:23:25.215]  Infowars.com to combat anti-Semitism.
[00:23:26.411 --> 00:23:33.454]  The Free State of Florida is set to have the most oppressive hate crime laws in America in order to combat anti-Semitism.
[00:23:33.454 --> 00:23:35.435]  And anything else they say is hate.
[00:23:35.435 --> 00:23:39.277]  Base dissent has just got your First Amendment rights revoked.
[00:23:39.277 --> 00:23:42.158]  Anti-Semitism hate speech laws about to be passed in Florida.
[00:23:42.158 --> 00:23:46.520]  Throwing pennies at the synagogue is now five years in jail.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.502]  There is no First Amendment right to conduct.
[00:23:49.502 --> 00:23:53.444]  Jewish Florida State Representative Randy Fine told the media earlier this week.
[00:23:53.444 --> 00:23:56.045]  We're going to play a clip of what he has to say, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:57.073 --> 00:24:01.875]  But notice, he says, graffiti is illegal, but it's a misdemeanor.
[00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:04.497]  But if we say it's hateful, five years in jail.
[00:24:04.497 --> 00:24:09.319]  So that speech, you can say graffiti is illegal because it's somebody else's property.
[00:24:09.319 --> 00:24:10.740]  That's a property violation.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:16.543]  But they're building an unconstitutional bridge, then saying, well, we're not going to give you a $500 fine.
[00:24:16.543 --> 00:24:20.245]  Your second offense, you know, two weeks in jail.
[00:24:20.245 --> 00:24:20.385]  No.
[00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:36.073]  We're gonna say if what you said is hateful, and by the ADL definition, and the definitions the Feds are creating, and Washington's creating, and the other states are creating, criticizing open borders, election fraud, lockdowns, forced injections, whatever else they want.
[00:24:36.073 --> 00:24:43.554]  A bill was introduced, what, a month ago by the Democrats in Congress, that if you criticize a minority in any way, five years in jail.
[00:24:43.554 --> 00:24:44.934]  They're introducing these bills.
[00:24:44.934 --> 00:24:47.195]  They're trying to do this.
[00:24:47.195 --> 00:24:49.435]  You saw the Deputy Head of the EU Commission.
[00:24:50.831 --> 00:25:00.556]  Three weeks ago at the World Government Summit, look to members of the Republican delegation, Democrat delegation that were there, members of Congress that said, we've already banned free speech and hate speech.
[00:25:00.556 --> 00:25:02.056]  We know you're about to ban it as well.
[00:25:02.056 --> 00:25:05.218]  And the Republican, Democrat, Congress people nodded their heads.
[00:25:05.218 --> 00:25:06.098]  It's here.
[00:25:06.098 --> 00:25:07.199]  It's not coming.
[00:25:07.199 --> 00:25:08.420]  It's here.
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.381]  And it's beyond the canary in the coal mine.
[00:25:10.381 --> 00:25:12.061]  So here he is explaining this.
[00:25:12.061 --> 00:25:13.062]  They'll take a misdemeanor.
[00:25:13.936 --> 00:25:14.776]  That's a misdemeanor.
[00:25:14.776 --> 00:25:20.258]  It has nothing to do with a quote, hate, but because the thought behind it was bad, five years in jail.
[00:25:20.258 --> 00:25:21.259]  Here it is.
[00:25:21.259 --> 00:25:25.480]  Holding people accountable without violating their free speech.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.161]  Sure.
[00:25:26.161 --> 00:25:31.323]  And again, I would remind you that there is no, there's no First Amendment right to conduct.
[00:25:31.323 --> 00:25:32.703]  There's a First Amendment right to speech.
[00:25:32.703 --> 00:25:35.984]  And the things that we're targeting in the bill are not speech.
[00:25:35.984 --> 00:25:39.706]  Again, if someone wants to stand across the street from my house and wave the sign on the sidewalk,
[00:25:40.086 --> 00:25:43.088]  They have every right to do that, and this bill won't have anything to do with that.
[00:25:43.088 --> 00:25:48.291]  But when it veers into conduct, and so the way we're going to approach this is through a hate crime kicker.
[00:25:48.291 --> 00:25:53.433]  So if you project, if you graffiti a building, it is a crime now.
[00:25:53.433 --> 00:25:58.056]  But if your motivation is hate, it will be a third degree felony, you will spend five years in prison.
[00:25:58.056 --> 00:26:00.477]  If you want to litter, it's a crime right now.
[00:26:00.477 --> 00:26:06.100]  But if you litter, and if your motivation is a hate crime, it will be a third degree felony, you will spend five years in jail.
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.101]  It is a crime right now,
[00:26:07.521 --> 00:26:09.683]  To hang banners from an interstate.
[00:26:09.683 --> 00:26:12.165]  For obvious reasons, we don't want to distract drivers.
[00:26:12.165 --> 00:26:18.691]  But if you do that, and you have a hate crime, a hate motivation, it will be a third degree felony, you will spend five years in jail.
[00:26:18.691 --> 00:26:21.393]  How optimistic are you of moving this bill along?
[00:26:21.393 --> 00:26:23.695]  I guarantee the bill will pass.
[00:26:23.695 --> 00:26:24.756]  And I never do that.
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.321]  Ron DeSantis.
[00:26:33.321 --> 00:26:38.605]  Now that will be just a nail in the coffin too far if that's the case.
[00:26:38.605 --> 00:26:48.993]  But taking crimes that aren't felonies, that aren't associated with violence, and then saying we're going to make it a hate crime five years in jail if you litter.
[00:26:48.993 --> 00:26:52.175]  So I'm protesting outside the ADL because they're anti-free speech.
[00:26:52.175 --> 00:26:53.696]  We really should do that.
[00:26:53.696 --> 00:26:55.037]  Very authoritarian.
[00:26:55.037 --> 00:27:02.083]  And I leave, I forget and leave say a cup of iced tea and a styrofoam cup on the steps of it.
[00:27:03.021 --> 00:27:05.322]  Or a handkerchief falls out of the back of my pocket.
[00:27:05.322 --> 00:27:11.344]  Oh, you littered in front of the ADL five years in prison.
[00:27:11.344 --> 00:27:13.745]  This is the plan to get our free speech.
[00:27:13.745 --> 00:27:14.966]  They've already done it in Europe.
[00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:23.149]  You've seen all the arrest videos of where a veteran posts the trans flag as a swastika, because if you put it together, four of them, it makes a swastika.
[00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.889]  They arrested him.
[00:27:23.889 --> 00:27:26.270]  Last time I heard, he's still in jail.
[00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.391]  Came to his house, took him to jail.
[00:27:29.701 --> 00:27:37.769]  This is the plan, this is what's going on, and they specifically don't want you talking about the poison shots, or the open borders, or any of it.
[00:27:37.769 --> 00:27:43.034]  That's all defined by the Justice Department as white supremacists.
[00:27:43.034 --> 00:27:46.017]  And then by extension, everything else is racist.
[00:27:46.017 --> 00:27:54.365]  But violent criminals, I saw another article today on Washington State, where a mass shooter, who was black, got out while he's gonna face trial.
[00:27:55.854 --> 00:27:57.514]  Was only in jail a few weeks.
[00:27:57.514 --> 00:27:58.615]  Shot a whole bunch of people.
[00:27:58.615 --> 00:27:59.475]  But that's okay.
[00:27:59.475 --> 00:28:00.035]  You're black.
[00:28:00.035 --> 00:28:01.595]  We're gonna let you out of jail.
[00:28:01.595 --> 00:28:17.679]  But if you say something mean to the ADL or to Black Lives Matter or the NAACP that are completely un-American, foaming at the mouth, weaponize groups, coming after all of our freedoms, well then, you're in deep trouble.
[00:28:17.679 --> 00:28:19.540]  So if America bows down to this,
[00:28:20.956 --> 00:28:32.980]  As people do, remember during the Black Lives Matter, thousands of white people at events, bowing and worshipping black people, shining their boots, kissing their ass, while the black people spew anti-white racist rhetoric.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:42.522]  This is just a sign of them submitting to their collective guilt and Stockholm Syndrome, and that they'll follow whatever agenda comes out of Black Lives Matter that could care less about black people.
[00:28:42.522 --> 00:28:46.324]  In fact, it says their number one goal is ending the nuclear family for black people.
[00:28:46.324 --> 00:28:47.344]  Boy, with friends like that,
[00:28:48.442 --> 00:28:49.943]  Who needs enemies?
[00:28:49.943 --> 00:28:55.647]  All right, we're going to come back with a lot of other news on the Poisoned Shot front, then I'm going to shift gears into all the other news.
[00:28:55.647 --> 00:28:58.109]  Jam-packed broadcast today, and a special guest in studio.
[00:28:58.109 --> 00:29:00.771]  Stay with us.
[00:29:00.771 --> 00:29:12.740]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to infowarestore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:17.083]  I am humbly, hand-in-hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in
[00:29:17.643 --> 00:29:21.084]  Many of you for years have never gone to InfoWarshaw.com.
[00:29:21.084 --> 00:29:29.885]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarshaw.com and never experience these great products and never fund the operation.
[00:29:29.885 --> 00:29:32.946]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[00:29:32.946 --> 00:29:34.306]  That's great and I thank you.
[00:29:34.306 --> 00:29:35.826]  But we need funds to operate.
[00:29:35.826 --> 00:29:44.688]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil and our Fizzy Magnesium and our SleepAid and our Nitric Oxide and our Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:29:44.688 --> 00:29:46.148]  All of these are really great products.
[00:29:46.288 --> 00:29:48.913]  They keep us on air, plus you're missing out on having these products.
[00:29:48.913 --> 00:29:57.830]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate, and go to Infowarsstore.com right now and get these great Infowars products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:30:00.083 --> 00:30:02.063]  I've got some good news.
[00:30:02.063 --> 00:30:08.945]  Our high-quality supplements really work, and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[00:30:08.945 --> 00:30:09.765]  That's the good news.
[00:30:09.765 --> 00:30:10.905]  They're amazing.
[00:30:10.905 --> 00:30:19.086]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to InfoWareStore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[00:30:19.086 --> 00:30:22.527]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the InfoWare.
[00:30:22.527 --> 00:30:27.448]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[00:30:27.448 --> 00:30:28.268]  Think what would happen.
[00:30:29.208 --> 00:30:42.738]  If those of you on the fence actually went to Infowarsstore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects, so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[00:30:42.738 --> 00:30:44.219]  Also, we've got the
[00:30:44.679 --> 00:30:51.708]  Super high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones as well.
[00:30:51.708 --> 00:30:53.090]  Or Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:57.515]  Just go try the product, fund the InfoWar, and help us defeat the New World Order together.
[00:30:57.515 --> 00:30:58.777]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:30:59.918 --> 00:31:08.365]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars has proven itself the last 28 years to be over the globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants.
[00:31:08.365 --> 00:31:13.830]  And we fund our operation with viewers and listeners' support while selling you great products at the same time.
[00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:18.193]  So I want to thank all the viewers and listeners who have supported us over the years by spreading the word.
[00:31:18.814 --> 00:31:20.935]  I'm praying for the broadcast and buying product.
[00:31:20.935 --> 00:31:38.003]  But I really want to encourage those of you that have been on the fence, that have never actually gone to Infowarshore.com to go there and get the great books and films and supplements and survival gear that's there that won't just empower you and enrich your life, but again will keep this broadcast transmitted.
[00:31:38.003 --> 00:31:41.905]  So whether it's Real Red Pill Plus or our super high quality CBD oil for the 50% off
[00:31:42.765 --> 00:31:48.310]  Or a great physiomagnesium product, or whether it's down-and-out, I rate Sleep Bae that's back in stock.
[00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.951]  It's all there.
[00:31:48.951 --> 00:31:52.534]  Our Turmeric 95% Humanoid, strongest out there, Turmeric 95.
[00:31:52.534 --> 00:31:56.057]  It's all available at InfoWorksShore.com, and it keeps us on the air.
[00:31:56.057 --> 00:31:58.999]  So make the decision to enrich your life and keep us on air.
[00:31:58.999 --> 00:31:59.700]  InfoWorksShore.com.
[00:32:01.747 --> 00:32:11.455]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[00:32:11.455 --> 00:32:15.137]  We can't stay on air without your help, and I want to thank you all for your past support.
[00:32:15.137 --> 00:32:22.063]  And I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products at InfoWarsStore.com to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[00:32:22.623 --> 00:32:26.865]  Ultimate Bone Broth, finally sold out for over two years, back in stock.
[00:32:26.865 --> 00:32:29.606]  Real Red Pill Plus, simply amazing.
[00:32:29.606 --> 00:32:31.867]  Nitric, boosts what it does for your heart.
[00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:33.607]  Cardiovascular, critical.
[00:32:33.607 --> 00:32:41.650]  All these products, like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Supermelt Vitality, they're all available and in stock, ready to ship to you, right down at infowarrestore.com.
[00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:50.634]  And the final 1,200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, and I'm not gonna sign anymore after that, are exclusively available at infowarrestore.com as well.
[00:32:50.794 --> 00:32:53.216]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[00:32:53.216 --> 00:32:54.097]  We didn't have them for sale.
[00:32:54.097 --> 00:32:55.638]  But now, I signed the last books.
[00:32:55.638 --> 00:33:00.942]  You can get them right now.
[00:33:00.942 --> 00:33:06.847]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.768 --> 00:33:24.391]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:24.391 --> 00:33:30.635]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:30.635 --> 00:33:37.140]  Okay, I want to finish up with the really important Poison Shot News and how close we are to bringing the criminals to justice.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:44.364]  Now, we've already convicted them in a court of public opinion, which will make it much harder for them to launch another attack or lockdown.
[00:33:44.364 --> 00:33:45.405]  We've already got them on the ropes.
[00:33:45.405 --> 00:33:46.306]  We've got to go all the way.
[00:33:47.438 --> 00:33:50.139]  You know I don't hype something up as positive if it isn't positive.
[00:33:50.139 --> 00:33:52.941]  I don't tell you I think we're winning if we're not winning.
[00:33:52.941 --> 00:33:56.263]  Now we're not completely winning, we're not dominating, but we're starting to.
[00:33:56.263 --> 00:33:59.564]  The Great Awakening is here and you are at the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:59.564 --> 00:34:01.345]  Never forget that.
[00:34:01.345 --> 00:34:08.269]  Now before I go any further, I want to show you a headline that just came out a couple days ago.
[00:34:08.269 --> 00:34:12.371]  Right-wing culture has Alex Jones style craziness to energize it.
[00:34:12.371 --> 00:34:13.691]  What does the left have?
[00:34:13.691 --> 00:34:14.592]  London Guardian article.
[00:34:16.001 --> 00:34:26.412]  They basically admit that Alex Jones, in what they track from Europe to Australia to the United States, creates the culture and the talking points against the New World Order.
[00:34:26.412 --> 00:34:35.061]  And they have rightfully tracked it back to this broadcast and our guests and what we do of analyzing the enemy and giving people accurate information about what they're doing.
[00:34:35.882 --> 00:34:37.142]  And I don't just do it on my show.
[00:34:37.142 --> 00:34:39.343]  I do it behind the scenes with other prominent people.
[00:34:39.343 --> 00:34:40.404]  And I'm not up here bragging.
[00:34:40.404 --> 00:34:48.626]  I'm giving you a report card on how hard I'm working for all of us, including my family and yours, because we're all in this boat together.
[00:34:48.626 --> 00:34:50.267]  People ask me all the time, why do you work so hard?
[00:34:50.267 --> 00:34:51.087]  Why are you tireless?
[00:34:51.087 --> 00:34:53.308]  Why are you near fearless?
[00:34:53.308 --> 00:34:54.628]  Why do you do what you do?
[00:34:54.628 --> 00:34:55.669]  How can you take the attacks?
[00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:57.469]  Because I have children.
[00:34:57.469 --> 00:35:01.131]  The New World Order is completely evil.
[00:35:01.131 --> 00:35:03.391]  So, why would you not oppose it?
[00:35:03.391 --> 00:35:05.292]  Giving in to it is sure destruction.
[00:35:06.969 --> 00:35:13.051]  So that said, ladies and gentlemen, let me give you a little report on the state of InfoWars.
[00:35:13.051 --> 00:35:22.094]  Just last week, they got the big bankruptcy filing for free speech systems complete into the federal court.
[00:35:22.094 --> 00:35:24.095]  And it's about what I had thought it was.
[00:35:24.095 --> 00:35:26.896]  We lost a million dollars last year.
[00:35:26.896 --> 00:35:28.937]  Sounds like a lot, but for an operation this big,
[00:35:30.509 --> 00:35:31.950]  That's not that big a shortfall.
[00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:47.243]  It takes about $30 million a year to run this operation with bandwidth and crew and legal and all the things we've got to do and subscribing, you know, to major outfits, you know, for the photos we use like Getty, all of it.
[00:35:47.243 --> 00:35:51.666]  It costs about $30 million to crack that nut.
[00:35:51.666 --> 00:35:58.272]  And that's with us with our feelers and things kind of pulled in and not sitting reporters all over and not being able to operate like we did five, six years ago.
[00:35:59.585 --> 00:36:00.865]  But still having a mass effect.
[00:36:00.865 --> 00:36:02.206]  And the numbers are out there now.
[00:36:02.206 --> 00:36:03.026]  They try to twist them.
[00:36:03.026 --> 00:36:04.847]  Oh, Alex Jones is $100,000 a month.
[00:36:04.847 --> 00:36:09.168]  Yeah, the court has allowed that because that's what my legal bills are.
[00:36:09.168 --> 00:36:10.388]  So I don't do this for money.
[00:36:10.388 --> 00:36:12.949]  If I wanted to do it for money, I would have taken the deal at Fox News.
[00:36:12.949 --> 00:36:19.391]  I would have taken the deal with Premier Radio Networks and Clear Channel and things like that.
[00:36:19.391 --> 00:36:23.333]  Many, many years ago, they wanted me to be the next Rush Limbaugh.
[00:36:23.333 --> 00:36:25.053]  I decided not to do it.
[00:36:25.053 --> 00:36:27.214]  No, I do this because I want to change the future for the better.
[00:36:28.439 --> 00:36:31.343]  So here's the bottom line.
[00:36:31.343 --> 00:36:39.915]  We'll be able to go through this Chapter 11, Subchapter 5 reorganization if we can be profitable.
[00:36:39.915 --> 00:36:41.997]  And we're barely in the black this year.
[00:36:43.581 --> 00:36:47.003]  But because we were in the red last year, we're still in the black.
[00:36:47.003 --> 00:36:49.225]  So it's a very simple equation.
[00:36:49.225 --> 00:36:50.526]  I'm not telling you what to do.
[00:36:50.526 --> 00:36:54.288]  I'm asking you, and it's a decision you have to listen to and make.
[00:36:54.288 --> 00:37:04.395]  Do you want InfoWars and this crew and this historic operation and our archives and all the great work we do, our best work ever is happening now, to stay on the air?
[00:37:05.706 --> 00:37:12.531]  Or do you want this shut down, I'll still be on the air, but it will be diminishing waste, and not as effective for a while?
[00:37:12.531 --> 00:37:14.452]  Do you want that to happen?
[00:37:14.452 --> 00:37:21.797]  Now it's a very easy question, because we've got really amazing products that really do empower your life, and really are the highest quality.
[00:37:21.797 --> 00:37:34.065]  So if you'll just do what less than 1% of listeners have done, and actually go to InfoWarsTore.com, and actually get some great products that will enrich you and your family's life, then please take action.
[00:37:35.242 --> 00:37:39.305]  In fact, I know it came in weeks ago, but I was never given a canister of it, even though I took one home.
[00:37:39.305 --> 00:37:47.730]  Can I have a canister of the probiotic, prebiotic, that has been sold out for over a year, that finally came in?
[00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:49.591]  Can I have one of those in here to show people?
[00:37:49.591 --> 00:37:50.172]  That'd be awesome.
[00:37:51.709 --> 00:37:59.453]  That is an amazing product that does incredible things in your gut and helps create these natural amino acids that are so good and even anti-cancer.
[00:37:59.453 --> 00:38:01.474]  The prebiotics back in stock.
[00:38:01.474 --> 00:38:05.236]  It's 40% off at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:38:06.914 --> 00:38:11.276]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:38:11.276 --> 00:38:19.741]  Ultimate Bone Broth, sold out for over two years, now even stronger with the turmeric, with the chaga mushroom, with the bee pollen, with everything.
[00:38:19.741 --> 00:38:27.045]  It's back in stock for the same price as other premium bone broths, but it's even better because of all the other great things it's got in it.
[00:38:27.045 --> 00:38:29.947]  And yes, this, the Prebiotic Fiber.
[00:38:29.947 --> 00:38:31.167]  Amazing.
[00:38:31.167 --> 00:38:33.989]  It is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:38:35.629 --> 00:38:42.211]  But let me tell you what you should really be taking.
[00:38:42.211 --> 00:38:44.412]  And I guess they took the bottle of it off my desk.
[00:38:44.412 --> 00:38:44.892]  That's fine.
[00:38:44.892 --> 00:38:45.472]  I've been gone.
[00:38:45.472 --> 00:38:47.472]  Whatever.
[00:38:47.472 --> 00:38:51.794]  That is our CBD oil.
[00:38:51.794 --> 00:38:57.255]  In 10 milligram, 25 milligram, and 1,000 milligram.
[00:38:57.255 --> 00:39:02.817]  All of these products are the highest rated full spectrum CBD oil for
[00:39:04.522 --> 00:39:09.186]  About 70% off what they would be retail.
[00:39:09.186 --> 00:39:13.689]  This thousand milligram would be sold for $160 retail, discounted for $100.
[00:39:13.689 --> 00:39:16.512]  It's $67 at Infowarshore.com.
[00:39:16.512 --> 00:39:24.678]  You take one drop under your tongue every day, what it does for your bones, your joints, everything is simply incredible.
[00:39:24.678 --> 00:39:29.422]  What it does for your brain, look into CBD oil and neurological disorders, it just goes on and on.
[00:39:29.422 --> 00:39:31.124]  Everybody should be taking a couple drops of this.
[00:39:32.381 --> 00:39:34.162]  Before you go to sleep at night.
[00:39:34.162 --> 00:39:35.962]  Some people like the gummies.
[00:39:35.962 --> 00:39:37.223]  We have those as well.
[00:39:37.223 --> 00:39:38.883]  But that's a no-brainer.
[00:39:38.883 --> 00:39:43.885]  Just go to Infowarshore.com and get the Infowars MD CBD oil.
[00:39:43.885 --> 00:39:45.125]  Highest quality.
[00:39:45.125 --> 00:39:46.506]  Tested by outside firms.
[00:39:48.103 --> 00:39:50.045]  Saying it's the highest rated you're going to get.
[00:39:50.045 --> 00:39:51.666]  People are like, yeah, well that's incredible.
[00:39:51.666 --> 00:39:52.487]  You have the highest rated.
[00:39:52.487 --> 00:39:53.808]  Yes, of course we have the highest rated.
[00:39:53.808 --> 00:39:54.769]  That's what we look for.
[00:39:54.769 --> 00:39:57.211]  Our turmeric 95 is the same thing as bodies.
[00:39:57.211 --> 00:39:58.251]  Bodies has been sold out a while.
[00:39:58.251 --> 00:39:59.713]  It's going to be coming back in.
[00:39:59.713 --> 00:40:01.074]  A different manufacturer.
[00:40:01.074 --> 00:40:04.917]  We learned that we were buying the turmeric for bodies from this place.
[00:40:04.917 --> 00:40:11.482]  So we just went to them and it's turmeric 95, meaning it's 95% curcuminoid, just like bodies.
[00:40:11.482 --> 00:40:13.104]  The same turmeric.
[00:40:13.104 --> 00:40:13.484]  Turmeric 95.
[00:40:15.148 --> 00:40:18.930]  For inflammation, for anti-cancer, for your whole body, for your brain.
[00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:19.511]  It's amazing.
[00:40:19.511 --> 00:40:19.691]  Tumor95.
[00:40:19.691 --> 00:40:20.752]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:40:20.752 --> 00:40:20.812]  888-253-3139.
[00:40:20.812 --> 00:40:29.877]  And the reason I'm doing a long plug here, you've noticed I've really cut back on plugging the last month or so.
[00:40:38.308 --> 00:40:39.649]  I want to cover news.
[00:40:39.649 --> 00:40:44.612]  I don't want to sit up here and plug products, but these really are great products and they fund the operation.
[00:40:44.612 --> 00:40:49.195]  And so if you've been on the fence and you haven't gone to InfoWareStore.com, get the products.
[00:40:49.195 --> 00:40:55.319]  When you love the products, when you try them, sign up for auto ship, get 10% off on your next order, canceling time for free.
[00:40:55.319 --> 00:41:01.283]  But that way you don't forget every month, every six months, every nine months, you can do it every month, every two months, every three months.
[00:41:01.283 --> 00:41:05.366]  You just click when you want to be auto ship the product, then they hold some back.
[00:41:05.366 --> 00:41:07.948]  So even if it sells out, we'll have some held back for you.
[00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:17.375]  And it just gets delivered to you every three months, every six months, whenever you want it delivered, whenever you run out of it, you just click on there, auto-ship, and it just comes to your door.
[00:41:17.375 --> 00:41:22.918]  That way you support the broadcast, and you know you're going to get the product, and it comes there, and then we stay on the air.
[00:41:22.918 --> 00:41:34.287]  If just 1% of you more would make your personal decision to get great products that enrich and power your life, and keep us on air, I would not be spending
[00:41:35.353 --> 00:41:45.741]  On average, three to four hours a day, instead of doing special reports and interviews and kicking globalist ass, I am running around, trying to scrounge up money, trying to do all sorts of... I'm not complaining.
[00:41:45.741 --> 00:41:50.745]  I just... keep me on the field, keep me at the tip of the spear, but I cannot do it without you.
[00:41:50.745 --> 00:42:00.153]  So I want to thank those that have supported the broadcast, I want to thank those that have gotten the products, and I want to encourage those of you that have not, or those that got products and liked them, or loved them but never got them again, to do that.
[00:42:00.153 --> 00:42:01.354]  Or, do a straight donation.
[00:42:01.954 --> 00:42:05.498]  Go to Infowarsstore.com, right at the top it says Donator Support.
[00:42:05.498 --> 00:42:18.333]  Make a $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 donation one time, or you can sign up to recurring donation, cancel anytime, for free, in your profile at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:42:19.383 --> 00:42:20.725]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:42:20.725 --> 00:42:22.367]  You're the reason we're able to stay on air.
[00:42:22.367 --> 00:42:23.869]  So get the CBD oil.
[00:42:23.869 --> 00:42:25.071]  Get the Ultimate Bone Broth.
[00:42:25.071 --> 00:42:26.352]  Get the prebiotic.
[00:42:26.352 --> 00:42:28.816]  Get it all at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:42:28.816 --> 00:42:30.878]  And I thank you for your support.
[00:42:30.878 --> 00:42:33.602]  We're finally, in a couple of weeks, got new t-shirts coming in.
[00:42:34.483 --> 00:42:35.864]  And a lot of other stuff.
[00:42:35.864 --> 00:42:40.707]  You can also get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[00:42:40.707 --> 00:42:42.088]  The signed one is limited edition.
[00:42:42.088 --> 00:42:43.789]  We run out of the ones we have left.
[00:42:43.789 --> 00:42:44.589]  That's it.
[00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:47.151]  Like a thousand of them or less left right now.
[00:42:47.151 --> 00:42:48.332]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:42:48.332 --> 00:42:49.833]  And I thank you all for your support.
[00:42:49.833 --> 00:42:50.613]  I'm done plugging.
[00:42:50.613 --> 00:42:52.854]  I just know Michael Malice is coming in in studio.
[00:42:52.854 --> 00:42:54.195]  Won't be doing much plugging when he's on with us.
[00:42:54.195 --> 00:42:55.416]  So I just got it out of the way.
[00:42:55.416 --> 00:42:56.196]  Thanks for the support.
[00:42:56.196 --> 00:43:00.639]  Take action now.
[00:43:00.639 --> 00:43:01.120]  Right now.
[00:43:02.199 --> 00:43:12.632]  I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body and keep us on air.
[00:43:12.632 --> 00:43:16.977]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in
[00:43:17.518 --> 00:43:20.962]  Many of you for years have never gone to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:43:20.962 --> 00:43:29.693]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsTore.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[00:43:29.693 --> 00:43:32.816]  I'm sure you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[00:43:32.816 --> 00:43:33.778]  That's great and I thank you.
[00:43:34.178 --> 00:43:35.699]  But we need funds to operate.
[00:43:35.699 --> 00:43:44.065]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our Fizzy Magnesium, and our Sleep Aid, and our Nitric Oxide, and our Real Red Pill.
[00:43:44.065 --> 00:43:46.127]  Plus, all of these are really great products.
[00:43:46.127 --> 00:43:47.027]  They keep us on air.
[00:43:47.027 --> 00:43:48.808]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[00:43:48.808 --> 00:43:50.089]  So get off the bench.
[00:43:50.089 --> 00:43:50.930]  Get in the game.
[00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:57.695]  Step to the plate and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:44:01.127 --> 00:44:04.248]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:44:04.248 --> 00:44:06.548]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:44:06.548 --> 00:44:10.489]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:44:10.489 --> 00:44:19.410]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, the people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:27.192]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:44:28.234 --> 00:44:31.836]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:44:31.836 --> 00:44:37.659]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:44:37.659 --> 00:44:38.599]  I know you spread the word.
[00:44:38.599 --> 00:44:39.520]  I know you pray for us.
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.120]  That's wonderful.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:40.680]  Keep doing it.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:47.744]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[00:44:47.744 --> 00:44:48.925]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[00:44:49.665 --> 00:44:53.906]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Enforceware.com.
[00:44:53.906 --> 00:44:58.868]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Enforceware.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:44:58.868 --> 00:44:59.808]  Please take action now.
[00:44:59.808 --> 00:45:12.473]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border, exposing the cartels, and like coming under fire, or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals, and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[00:45:12.473 --> 00:45:14.233]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[00:45:14.233 --> 00:45:15.994]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[00:45:16.405 --> 00:45:19.207]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[00:45:19.207 --> 00:45:20.928]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[00:45:20.928 --> 00:45:23.430]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:27.793]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[00:45:27.793 --> 00:45:33.597]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[00:45:33.597 --> 00:45:38.501]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[00:45:38.501 --> 00:45:41.643]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the
[00:45:42.583 --> 00:45:50.788]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[00:45:50.788 --> 00:45:55.150]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:01.792]  I've got some good news.
[00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:08.677]  Our high-quality supplements really work, and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[00:46:08.677 --> 00:46:09.497]  That's the good news.
[00:46:09.497 --> 00:46:10.638]  They're amazing.
[00:46:10.638 --> 00:46:18.824]  The bad news is around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to InfoWarsaw.com and ever actually buy the products.
[00:46:18.824 --> 00:46:22.267]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the InfoWar.
[00:46:22.267 --> 00:46:27.191]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[00:46:27.191 --> 00:46:28.031]  Think what would happen.
[00:46:28.932 --> 00:46:42.481]  If those of you on the fence actually went to InfoWarStore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[00:46:42.481 --> 00:46:51.447]  Also, we've got the super high quality, full spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones as well.
[00:46:51.447 --> 00:46:52.828]  Or Real Red Bull Plus.
[00:46:52.828 --> 00:46:57.251]  Just go try the product, fund the InfoWar, and help us defeat the New World Order together.
[00:46:57.251 --> 00:46:58.552]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:46:58.792 --> 00:46:58.852]  Wow!
[00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:38.520]  Michael Malice, the host of You're Welcome, is a best-selling author, great researcher, great historian, and good friend of mine.
[00:47:46.405 --> 00:48:15.878]  He's gonna be in studio with us for the next two hours coming up second third hour Paul Watson with the huge British news had already mentioned is gonna be popping in with their health minister caught saying we'll release a new variant to scare the public into submission and so much more he's gonna be popping in during an interview to talk about that and all the big cover news I haven't gotten to yet but before I hit some of this other news I had a Michael Malice coming in here in about 12 minutes or so in the next hour just to finish up what I was saying last segment
[00:48:17.366 --> 00:48:19.266]  This is an information war.
[00:48:19.266 --> 00:48:21.087]  You want folks to fight the globalists.
[00:48:21.087 --> 00:48:23.607]  You want people to take on the tyrants.
[00:48:23.607 --> 00:48:27.688]  We're doing it and we're having hands down the biggest effect in this fight.
[00:48:27.688 --> 00:48:29.368]  And we're being mimicked.
[00:48:29.368 --> 00:48:30.528]  We're being parroted.
[00:48:30.528 --> 00:48:38.250]  We're being supported by so many other great prominent people that are looking into our research and finding out it's true.
[00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:44.211]  And InfoWars is having its greatest victories ever in hearts and minds around the country and the world.
[00:48:45.922 --> 00:48:48.883]  I was just flying around commercial in the United States.
[00:48:48.883 --> 00:48:51.204]  Got nothing but love last week.
[00:48:51.204 --> 00:48:55.605]  Nothing but love wherever I go, compared to quite a bit of hate previously.
[00:48:55.605 --> 00:49:00.667]  That's a report to you that we're winning the information war and the Great Awakening is here.
[00:49:01.718 --> 00:49:05.920]  But you've got to make the decision on whether or not you want these people to win.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:14.223]  And there's nowhere that you can support by spreading the word, by praying for the broadcast, by buying products like InfoWars and InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:49:14.223 --> 00:49:19.445]  And those that have been doing it know who you are, and you are the reason we've had such success.
[00:49:19.445 --> 00:49:22.026]  Without you, none of these good things would be happening.
[00:49:22.026 --> 00:49:24.447]  The enemy recognizes that we're the tip of the spear.
[00:49:24.447 --> 00:49:28.209]  That means you're the tip of the spear in the information war for hearts and minds.
[00:49:28.209 --> 00:49:31.330]  So I salute those that have supported us, and I just ask those that
[00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:34.491]  If you haven't, why aren't you spreading the word?
[00:49:34.491 --> 00:49:35.951]  Why aren't you buying the products?
[00:49:35.951 --> 00:49:38.131]  Why aren't you actively doing that?
[00:49:38.131 --> 00:49:40.852]  I'm just asking you a question because we need you.
[00:49:40.852 --> 00:49:41.512]  You need us.
[00:49:41.512 --> 00:49:43.232]  We're in this together.
[00:49:43.232 --> 00:49:48.853]  So, I'm simply asking all of you out there to think about what InfoWars has contributed.
[00:49:48.853 --> 00:49:53.054]  Think about how we've been the main target of the enemy because we're so effective and tell the truth.
[00:49:53.054 --> 00:49:58.615]  And then to make the decision to financially support the broadcast by getting great products at the same time.
[00:49:58.615 --> 00:50:00.435]  It's a decision that you've got to make.
[00:50:01.095 --> 00:50:04.016]  And I'm asking you to make that decision.
[00:50:04.016 --> 00:50:07.557]  I'm not complaining to the people that have been supporters over the years.
[00:50:07.557 --> 00:50:14.820]  Or if you don't have the finances, I really feel bad for you that you can't get these great supplements, and I wish they cost less, but I'm only going to sell the highest quality.
[00:50:17.042 --> 00:50:21.163]  But for those that have been on the fence, it's time to get off the fence right now.
[00:50:21.163 --> 00:50:24.525]  The enemy wouldn't want this show shut down if it wasn't so effective.
[00:50:24.525 --> 00:50:32.567]  So go to InfoWarsTore.com and get the highest quality CBD oil for your bones, your joints, your brain, your neurological systems.
[00:50:32.567 --> 00:50:35.148]  Get our great bone broth, get our great prebiotic.
[00:50:35.148 --> 00:50:39.810]  Get it all, vitamin D3, you name it, at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:50:42.691 --> 00:50:42.951]  All right.
[00:50:42.951 --> 00:50:49.613]  I just wanted to explain that and make that extremely clear about how important that decision is that you have to make for yourself.
[00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:51.173]  You're in the driver's seat.
[00:50:51.173 --> 00:50:53.754]  You have to make the decision.
[00:50:53.754 --> 00:50:54.094]  All right.
[00:50:54.094 --> 00:51:00.495]  Let me tell you what we're going to be covering here today.
[00:51:00.495 --> 00:51:02.316]  And we'll be covering the waterfront.
[00:51:02.316 --> 00:51:08.417]  But we're going to be discussing what it means to be white-pilled versus what it means to be red-pilled or blue-pilled.
[00:51:09.076 --> 00:51:15.580]  And I think we should describe it and create a new pill today here on air called Infinity Pill.
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:25.467]  Because I really think looking into infinity and realizing how timeless and incredible and how amazing things are is really the way to break free from the globalist control and realize they're finite.
[00:51:25.467 --> 00:51:28.489]  But the human experience is eternal and is infinite.
[00:51:29.497 --> 00:51:36.842]  We're also going to look at 5G and the fact that major study after major study is linked directly to cancer and people don't understand that.
[00:51:36.842 --> 00:51:39.524]  I have some video demonstrations that are going to lay that out.
[00:51:39.524 --> 00:51:51.013]  We're also going to look at the war in Ukraine that's escalated out of control and cannot be stopped before at least the thermal nuclear war, the end conclusion of this World War III path that we're already deeply into.
[00:51:51.013 --> 00:51:52.554]  World War III has already begun.
[00:51:52.554 --> 00:51:54.035]  The question is, will it go nuclear?
[00:51:55.199 --> 00:52:05.903]  Then we'll also continue to look at the entire attack on our youth and where that whole movement is going and how we can stop it.
[00:52:05.903 --> 00:52:12.645]  But also some good news I mentioned earlier, a new twist, EPA chief warns Ohio parents don't drink the water.
[00:52:12.645 --> 00:52:14.026]  And that seems simple, doesn't it?
[00:52:15.282 --> 00:52:19.765]  But normally on 9-11 they say the air is safe to breathe, the water is safe to drink.
[00:52:19.765 --> 00:52:20.605]  So much of the U.S.
[00:52:20.605 --> 00:52:30.692]  water supply is contaminated with hundreds, in some cases thousands of chemicals like atrazine, dioxins, bisphenol A, the list goes on and on.
[00:52:30.692 --> 00:52:32.473]  But to have the EPA chief
[00:52:33.877 --> 00:52:41.161]  Say you should do that, but we don't need the government to tell us to do that, but so many people wait till the government, like it's the ultimate authority, tells them.
[00:52:41.161 --> 00:52:48.506]  But to have the Biden administration actually do something real and say it's in your hands, protect yourself, is good.
[00:52:48.506 --> 00:52:53.449]  As they always tell you, Democrat, Republican administrations, the water is clean, the water is good.
[00:52:53.449 --> 00:52:56.350]  Well, just ask the folks in Flint, Michigan if that's the case.
[00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:57.571]  They know it's not.
[00:52:57.571 --> 00:53:02.334]  So I'm a big detractor from the Biden puppet administration.
[00:53:03.524 --> 00:53:06.605]  But I will give credit when credit's due.
[00:53:06.605 --> 00:53:08.026]  And so this is a good first move.
[00:53:08.026 --> 00:53:10.267]  Maybe it becomes contagious to tell the truth.
[00:53:10.267 --> 00:53:16.490]  EPA chief warns Ohio parents, I would not let my children play in the East Palestine creeks or streams.
[00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:23.653]  And he went on to say, after he was seen drinking the tap water, they went on to say, you should filter the tap water.
[00:53:25.089 --> 00:53:33.558]  EPA Chief Michael Regan warned Ohio parents to keep their children out of local creeks and streams along a toxic chemical mushroom cloud explosion in early February.
[00:53:33.558 --> 00:53:40.344]  And he himself didn't say filter, but the EPA under his direction is saying you should filter it.
[00:53:40.344 --> 00:53:41.826]  Reagan made it to East Palisade Wednesday.
[00:53:41.826 --> 00:53:45.249]  He was asked if he would let his kids play in the streams, and he said no.
[00:53:46.147 --> 00:53:49.488]  So we need to hear people in government tell the truth.
[00:53:49.488 --> 00:53:56.450]  But it's the same government that just told us these poison shots were safe, and then they work with big tech to censor anybody that tried to warn them.
[00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:59.191]  And the same thing goes for 5G and all the rest of it.
[00:53:59.191 --> 00:54:06.133]  You can't wait for the government, bought and paid for by these out-of-control Fortune 100 companies, to tell you something.
[00:54:06.133 --> 00:54:11.295]  You've got to do your own research and make that decision for yourself.
[00:54:11.295 --> 00:54:13.236]  Here's another example of what I was just talking about.
[00:54:14.124 --> 00:54:15.546]  This is out of Fox News.
[00:54:15.546 --> 00:54:20.434]  The Biden administration makes stunning admission on climate agenda in leaked internal memo.
[00:54:21.567 --> 00:54:33.653]  The Biden Administration acknowledged in a memo accidentally leaked on Friday that charging fossil fuel companies less to drill would provide greater energy security for the American people, despite its plan to hike royalties.
[00:54:33.653 --> 00:54:37.334]  They go on to say, though, despite that, they want to get us off fossil fuels.
[00:54:37.334 --> 00:54:45.999]  So they're going to hike the rates and continue to block pipelines and new permits to drill when they haven't created an alternative.
[00:54:45.999 --> 00:54:50.661]  There's not enough cobalt or lithium in the world to convert to
[00:54:51.923 --> 00:54:53.805]  Battery-driven cars.
[00:54:53.805 --> 00:54:58.369]  So what they're really doing is destroying the infrastructure and ensuring that our economy breaks down.
[00:54:58.369 --> 00:55:00.390]  And our economy is based on cars.
[00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:04.494]  Because of urban sprawl, we will totally collapse without it.
[00:55:04.494 --> 00:55:06.456]  Something Elon Musk explained over and over again.
[00:55:06.456 --> 00:55:10.539]  And there's all these actuaries and Prager University's done great breakdowns of it.
[00:55:10.539 --> 00:55:18.226]  But if you don't have 2.1 children on average for every family, there's no replacement rate and civilization collapses.
[00:55:18.226 --> 00:55:18.727]  I'm all for
[00:55:19.895 --> 00:55:28.042]  Planing off population naturally with wealth and success and middle class and people, if they choose to have five kids or two kids or one kid or no kid.
[00:55:28.042 --> 00:55:38.472]  But to have policies designed to stop people having children, like Japan's down to 1.1, Italy's at 1.2, France is at 1.3, England's at 1.4, indigenous U.S.
[00:55:38.472 --> 00:55:42.035]  populations, white, black, Hispanic, we're at about 1.5.
[00:55:42.035 --> 00:55:45.138]  We're not replacing ourselves, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:46.929 --> 00:56:03.080]  And instead they're bringing in collapsed third world permanent underclasses who have no history of freedom, so they will accept the new authoritarian system because the globalist corporate fascists don't want people to aspire to the greatest form of liberty the world ever saw, the United States of America.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.701]  Which doesn't mean it was much liberty.
[00:56:04.701 --> 00:56:09.164]  But compared in a metric to all other systems, it was fantastically free.
[00:56:09.904 --> 00:56:15.048]  The global corporate fascist centralized tyrants don't want you to aspire to wealth and success.
[00:56:15.048 --> 00:56:21.673]  That's why they want to dynamite and destroy any upward bridge, any ladder up.
[00:56:21.673 --> 00:56:25.176]  And that's why they're so incredibly criminal.
[00:56:25.176 --> 00:56:37.246]  While the globalists invest in China and they build new coal power plants every week that are totally dirty, our totally clean coal power plants only produce carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[00:56:39.437 --> 00:56:42.380]  We are completely shutting down while they are building.
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:44.882]  Mexico opens a new coal power plant every month.
[00:56:44.882 --> 00:56:46.363]  China every week.
[00:56:46.363 --> 00:56:47.744]  India every two, three weeks.
[00:56:47.744 --> 00:56:57.232]  As we shut down more plants every single week, and our energy prices have more than doubled the last two years, it's all by design to make you poor so they can control you.
[00:56:57.232 --> 00:56:58.033]  Look at the blue cities.
[00:56:58.613 --> 00:57:00.615]  Look what they are living like.
[00:57:00.615 --> 00:57:02.136]  Look at what they produce.
[00:57:02.136 --> 00:57:10.623]  And that is the same feudalistic corporate manager system to make you poor so they can dictate the terms of our surrender.
[00:57:10.623 --> 00:57:12.344]  Feudalism is not a new system.
[00:57:12.344 --> 00:57:19.070]  It's the oldest form of government practiced by every human culture before the Renaissance 500 years ago.
[00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:22.052]  We're not going forward into some progressive new future.
[00:57:22.052 --> 00:57:27.797]  We're going downward into a high-tech version of every form of ancient slavery.
[00:57:28.417 --> 00:57:29.699]  All right, we're gonna go to break.
[00:57:29.699 --> 00:57:30.259]  Come back.
[00:57:30.259 --> 00:57:34.744]  Start hour number two with Michael Malice in studio for two hours.
[00:57:34.744 --> 00:57:38.668]  He'll break down what it is to be white-pilled straight ahead.
[00:57:38.668 --> 00:57:39.409]  And I agree with him.
[00:57:39.409 --> 00:57:42.913]  We are moving into the age of the white pill.
[00:57:42.913 --> 00:57:45.716]  Don't miss the second and third hour today.
[00:57:45.716 --> 00:57:46.557]  We are live.
[00:57:50.751 --> 00:57:58.958]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[00:57:58.958 --> 00:58:00.419]  That is the hellish future.
[00:58:00.419 --> 00:58:09.827]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsware.com.
[00:58:09.827 --> 00:58:15.411]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:58:15.411 --> 00:58:17.393]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:58:17.973 --> 00:58:23.360]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowarsware.com.
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:27.305]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:58:27.305 --> 00:58:33.193]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[00:58:33.193 --> 00:58:35.295]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[00:58:36.056 --> 00:58:37.117]  Or unsigned copies.
[00:58:37.117 --> 00:58:47.482]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[00:58:47.482 --> 00:58:48.523]  This is an Infowar.
[00:58:48.523 --> 00:58:50.144]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[00:58:52.515 --> 00:58:58.921]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane place.
[00:58:58.921 --> 00:59:00.663]  World War III has already started.
[00:59:00.663 --> 00:59:02.985]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[00:59:02.985 --> 00:59:04.146]  There's mass censorship.
[00:59:04.146 --> 00:59:06.348]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[00:59:06.348 --> 00:59:08.630]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:13.014]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[00:59:13.254 --> 00:59:17.196]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[00:59:17.196 --> 00:59:25.621]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at Infowarshore.com.
[00:59:25.621 --> 00:59:34.286]  And whether it's a final signed copy, they're almost all sold out, or the great reset in the War for the World, or Old MacMillan bras finally back in stock after over two years, it's all available at Infowarshore.com.
[00:59:34.286 --> 00:59:35.887]  These are truly amazing products.
[00:59:36.047 --> 00:59:42.252]  So, get your InfoWars products at InfoWarsStore.com and enrich your life while keeping the broadcast on the air.
[00:59:42.252 --> 00:59:46.856]  It is your decision on whether or not we stay on air, so please take action now at InfoWarsStore.
[01:00:03.909 --> 01:00:08.213]  We Americans are under attack by our own government.
[01:00:08.213 --> 01:00:13.558]  We, the people, have no choice but to once again defend our freedom.
[01:00:13.558 --> 01:00:18.683]  This has all happened before, and we can learn much from the American Revolution.
[01:00:18.683 --> 01:00:28.151]  Starting in 1763, to pay for debts incurred from a war with France, the British began enforcing new taxes on the American colonies.
[01:00:29.012 --> 01:00:39.536]  In response to this, the colonies set up their own parallel government based on a simple structure of three committees delegated to voice the will of the people.
[01:00:39.536 --> 01:00:43.197]  A committee of correspondence to disseminate information.
[01:00:43.197 --> 01:00:48.059]  A committee of inspection to enforce Continental Congress decisions.
[01:00:48.059 --> 01:00:55.602]  And the most important of the three, a committee of safety to act as general executive in the absence of legal authority.
[01:00:56.422 --> 01:01:09.968]  These committees stemmed from each community of all the colonies and each and every local committee of safety had two missions to provide military support and monitor political affairs.
[01:01:09.968 --> 01:01:18.232]  Each community delegated its own representatives to speak on their behalf at the county level and then at the state level.
[01:01:18.812 --> 01:01:28.440]  Where state legislatures are thereby formed and senators are elected to represent the overall interests of the people in that state.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:37.106]  With these committees, the 13 colonies honorably created a parallel government that lawfully nullified British rule.
[01:01:37.106 --> 01:01:46.514]  This compelled the Crown to take it back by force, which was met by an honorable and lawful defense of the colonies, known as the American Revolution.
[01:01:47.254 --> 01:01:52.220]  The three-committee structure that made up this parallel government inspired our U.S.
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:57.185]  Constitution, a concept of government based upon delegation.
[01:01:57.185 --> 01:01:59.588]  Individuals were not elected to rule.
[01:01:59.588 --> 01:02:04.073]  Their only purpose was to facilitate and implement the will of the people.
[01:02:04.073 --> 01:02:08.238]  It was a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:17.694]  Each state was considered to be its own country, which was freely subordinating aspects of its own authority to a federal government.
[01:02:17.694 --> 01:02:28.997]  Lawfully speaking, this has never changed, but the federal government of the United States has become bloated with loyalists to the City of London and enemies of We The People.
[01:02:29.897 --> 01:02:44.168]  For well over a century, we the people have been coerced into becoming voluntary slaves to a multinational corporate power structure, which has increasingly dumbed us down more and more with each generation.
[01:02:44.168 --> 01:02:47.470]  Unconstitutional amendments have been enacted.
[01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:51.473]  Constitutional limits of representation have been ignored.
[01:02:51.473 --> 01:02:57.398]  And by accepting Federal Reserve banknotes, we have made ourselves a dishonorable nation of debtors.
[01:02:58.408 --> 01:03:01.673]  By continually contracting with the corporate U.S.
[01:03:01.673 --> 01:03:05.318]  being operated out of the Washington, D.C.
[01:03:05.318 --> 01:03:13.449]  city-state, Americans are perpetually surrendering their constitutional sovereignty in return for corporate benefits.
[01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:18.011]  We share a common enemy with our founding fathers.
[01:03:18.011 --> 01:03:20.152]  Today we call them globalists.
[01:03:20.152 --> 01:03:22.673]  Back then, they called them British.
[01:03:22.673 --> 01:03:27.455]  A foreign power exploiting the will and destiny of Americans.
[01:03:27.455 --> 01:03:30.596]  And back then, their remedy was the Committee of Safety.
[01:03:31.445 --> 01:03:33.407]  This is happening again today.
[01:03:33.407 --> 01:03:37.010]  Communities are forming their own committees of safety.
[01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:53.704]  An excellent example is Santa Rosa County, Florida, where the Recall Florida movement sprang from, which seeks to empower the citizens of Florida with the ability to recall county commissioners for corruption, malfeasance, and neglect of duty.
[01:03:54.664 --> 01:04:00.508]  The county sheriff is charged with upholding the supreme law of the Constitution.
[01:04:00.508 --> 01:04:13.637]  And with your county government in line with your county sheriff, citizens of that county will have the lawful parallel government they need to liberate themselves from contracts made with the corporate US.
[01:04:13.637 --> 01:04:20.882]  Because the powers held by the sheriff supersede those of any government official when in the jurisdiction of that county.
[01:04:21.822 --> 01:04:27.424]  The PSYOP today is meant to make you feel dependent upon the federal government.
[01:04:27.424 --> 01:04:30.225]  But that has always been your choice.
[01:04:30.225 --> 01:04:32.106]  And it's not the only choice.
[01:04:32.106 --> 01:04:38.168]  You can contact your local sheriff and ask him about his oath to uphold the Constitution.
[01:04:38.168 --> 01:04:40.789]  You can form committees of safety.
[01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:44.090]  And you can lawfully purge your local government of corruption.
[01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:49.096]  But it requires action, and time is quickly running out.
[01:04:49.096 --> 01:04:53.342]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:04:53.342 --> 01:04:55.725]  Alright folks, Michael Malice is live in studio.
[01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:57.107]  Stay with us, we're going live in 60 seconds.
[01:05:00.595 --> 01:05:08.797]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globals, in their own words, plan for our future.
[01:05:08.797 --> 01:05:10.258]  That is the hellish future.
[01:05:10.258 --> 01:05:19.160]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarshore.com.
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:25.244]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:05:25.244 --> 01:05:27.826]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:05:27.826 --> 01:05:33.210]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarshaw.com.
[01:05:33.210 --> 01:05:37.153]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:05:37.153 --> 01:05:43.037]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:05:43.037 --> 01:05:45.119]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[01:05:45.919 --> 01:05:46.919]  Or unsigned copies.
[01:05:46.919 --> 01:05:57.321]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[01:05:57.321 --> 01:05:58.362]  This is an Infowar.
[01:05:58.362 --> 01:06:02.162]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[01:06:02.162 --> 01:06:04.803]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:04.803 --> 01:06:09.864]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:06:18.354 --> 01:06:19.457]  Well, most of you know him.
[01:06:19.457 --> 01:06:20.840]  He doesn't need much of an introduction.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:25.933]  Best-selling author, hit podcaster, talk show host, Michael Malice.
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:32.383]  is our guest here for the next two hours, maybe longer, in studio with us today.
[01:06:32.383 --> 01:06:44.651]  You can find him at MichaelMalice.com, on Twitter at MichaelMalice, and he's got a book that I've been working on for several years, The White Pill, A Tale of Good and Evil, Michael Malice.
[01:06:44.651 --> 01:06:46.172]  And it couldn't be a more timely book.
[01:06:46.172 --> 01:06:53.737]  He started writing it, I know he told me about it years ago, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine and so much more.
[01:06:53.737 --> 01:06:55.718]  So this is a really important book to read.
[01:06:56.528 --> 01:06:58.851]  Those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[01:06:58.851 --> 01:07:03.918]  I haven't read the book yet, and I'll assure you, I will be reading the book.
[01:07:03.918 --> 01:07:09.725]  So he shared with us, so he said he could cover the waterfront, the censorship, all the things that are going on.
[01:07:09.725 --> 01:07:12.109]  I said, let's just first
[01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:15.311]  Try to give you the floor as best we can.
[01:07:15.311 --> 01:07:24.095]  Describe the book and your family's own experiences coming to the United States to flee all this tyranny, both from Hitler on one side and Stalin on the other.
[01:07:24.095 --> 01:07:27.436]  And now what it's like to see this nightmare starting again in the very same place.
[01:07:29.337 --> 01:07:29.778]  Ukraine.
[01:07:29.778 --> 01:07:31.279]  So it's great to have you here.
[01:07:31.279 --> 01:07:33.340]  Congratulations on The White Pill.
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:35.642]  I know you've written a lot of other best-selling books.
[01:07:35.642 --> 01:07:37.763]  I would guess this one took you the longest to write?
[01:07:37.763 --> 01:07:45.569]  Yeah, because there's so much information in there, because this book tells the story of the rise of the Soviet Union and its fall, which is a happy ending.
[01:07:45.569 --> 01:07:50.613]  But one of the other things that's very important to talk about, it was the Western response by all this was going on.
[01:07:50.613 --> 01:07:57.498]  So I think a lot of people, especially people in your audience, don't maybe have an appreciation of just how bad things were.
[01:07:58.198 --> 01:08:02.662]  And just how much people were apologizing for, historically speaking.
[01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:11.970]  So what I go through step-by-step is, people in America and people in the West, you know, we talk about totalitarianism, we talk about, you know, Alex, you talk about the globalists and their agenda.
[01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:19.696]  There is an understanding of things would get really bad, but we don't have to imagine what things would be bad, what that would look like.
[01:08:19.696 --> 01:08:24.020]  Because it's already happened here on Earth, in our lifetimes, of everyone listening to this.
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.783]  Uh, and it was systemic, and it was step-by-step.
[01:08:27.783 --> 01:08:37.332]  Stalin let him start it, of course Stalin built on it, and others after them, to kind of create a giant prison state.
[01:08:37.332 --> 01:08:39.634]  And I talk about just what steps they did.
[01:08:39.634 --> 01:08:47.182]  One of the biggest things that people need to appreciate in any variant of totalitarianism is any kind of private relationship
[01:08:47.762 --> 01:08:50.103]  is a threat to those in power.
[01:08:50.103 --> 01:08:56.286]  So, parents versus kids, husbands versus wives, friends versus each other, co-workers.
[01:08:56.286 --> 01:09:04.750]  Their goal is to create a society where no one can trust anyone else and they have to rely on the government for everything.
[01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:13.634]  And in many ways they largely succeeded with the fact of the Soviet Union, but the important thing to take away is they didn't get everything they wanted.
[01:09:13.634 --> 01:09:16.616]  They told people for decades, this is the country of the future,
[01:09:17.616 --> 01:09:19.216]  This is how it's going to be.
[01:09:19.216 --> 01:09:21.917]  We're the next wave.
[01:09:21.917 --> 01:09:24.738]  And they fell apart very, very quickly.
[01:09:24.738 --> 01:09:26.478]  And everyone thought this is going to be forever.
[01:09:26.478 --> 01:09:33.400]  If you watch Star Trek, Chekhov is there, because even in the far, far future, you're going to have the Westerners, or you're going to have the Soviets with Chekhov.
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.980]  That's not what ended up happening.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:43.142]  So I think one of the reasons, besides just telling that history, which I think is crucially important, is so many people in the West, and especially in America, have given up hope.
[01:09:43.662 --> 01:09:46.244]  They think the people who are their enemy are too powerful.
[01:09:46.244 --> 01:09:47.285]  They've been at this too long.
[01:09:47.285 --> 01:09:47.885]  They're too smart.
[01:09:47.885 --> 01:09:48.926]  They're too clever.
[01:09:48.926 --> 01:09:50.807]  And it's like, we've heard this story before.
[01:09:50.807 --> 01:10:01.494]  If you know they're lying about everything else, why are you so convinced they're telling the truth when they tell you that their victory is inevitable and that they're not going away and that you can't defeat them?
[01:10:01.494 --> 01:10:03.775]  That is the biggest lie that they tell.
[01:10:03.775 --> 01:10:09.279]  And so many people who would otherwise oppose them fall into that trap of believing them on that very crucial issue.
[01:10:09.907 --> 01:10:12.751]  By the way, I didn't talk to you before you came on live today.
[01:10:12.751 --> 01:10:15.254]  You got here in the green room and you just came out and came on live.
[01:10:15.254 --> 01:10:16.816]  I was struggling to try to define you.
[01:10:16.816 --> 01:10:24.366]  And once you started talking, I would describe you because I'm somewhat of a novice historian, so I know people when they know what they're talking about, when they don't.
[01:10:24.947 --> 01:10:38.312]  I would describe you as a pro-human person that's anti-totalitarian, anti-authoritarian, individual, hyper-libertarian, an anarchist?
[01:10:38.312 --> 01:10:41.333]  Yes, I'm an anarchist.
[01:10:41.333 --> 01:10:45.735]  But how you quantify this, because what you just said is so key, I want to zoom in on this and have you elaborate.
[01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:48.347]  Tyranny is not all-powerful.
[01:10:48.347 --> 01:10:52.088]  I want you to think it is and invest this mythic power.
[01:10:52.088 --> 01:10:53.169]  I'm not that articulate.
[01:10:53.169 --> 01:10:53.969]  I'm not that great.
[01:10:53.969 --> 01:10:58.031]  My audience, you know, together is amazing, but we're not God.
[01:10:58.031 --> 01:11:02.373]  But if they're so scared of info wars, or they've got to censor everybody, they're not that powerful.
[01:11:02.373 --> 01:11:08.136]  That's why the internet famous saying, nobody knows who coined it, the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[01:11:08.136 --> 01:11:09.296]  It's not hopeless.
[01:11:09.296 --> 01:11:10.817]  That's why you're saying you're white-billed.
[01:11:10.817 --> 01:11:12.098]  That's one, and right.
[01:11:12.098 --> 01:11:14.599]  And the other thing that I want people to take away is,
[01:11:15.359 --> 01:11:21.304]  There's a lot of people who have the belief that journalists used to be honest and now they're corrupt.
[01:11:21.304 --> 01:11:23.787]  And let me give you an example that's kind of a parallel.
[01:11:23.787 --> 01:11:25.788]  If you think back to when you're a kid, right?
[01:11:25.788 --> 01:11:29.272]  You think no one's drinking, no one's doing drugs, no one's sleeping around.
[01:11:29.272 --> 01:11:31.594]  Because you're a kid, you're in kindergarten, you're oblivious to all these things.
[01:11:31.594 --> 01:11:37.119]  Then you get older, you go to college, then it's more frequent and you're going to have the perception that this is becoming more common.
[01:11:37.119 --> 01:11:38.400]  It's not becoming more common.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:41.061]  You're just more aware of it as you age.
[01:11:41.061 --> 01:11:42.321]  Same thing with journalism.
[01:11:42.321 --> 01:11:51.024]  We're taught in school about the Spanish-American War, William Randolph Hearst, yellow journalism, remember the Maine, and how the journalists led us into that war.
[01:11:51.024 --> 01:11:59.066]  Then there's kind of this record scratch, and all the journalists become honest, and now conservatives, many conservatives think, well, they've just become corrupt in the last 20 years.
[01:11:59.066 --> 01:12:00.347]  No, no, no, no.
[01:12:00.347 --> 01:12:03.948]  One of the things I explain in this book, this has been going on for over a century.
[01:12:03.948 --> 01:12:04.748]  Most crucially,
[01:12:05.228 --> 01:12:13.169]  When Stalin was starving millions of Ukrainians by design, when people were not able to feed their kids, when they were...
[01:12:14.738 --> 01:12:16.739]  Make sure they didn't have any food.
[01:12:16.739 --> 01:12:23.142]  All, with two exceptions, of the Western journalists made the point to cover for these atrocities.
[01:12:23.142 --> 01:12:26.844]  And later they admitted that, oops, we got it wrong.
[01:12:26.844 --> 01:12:36.549]  Here's the thing, if I'm a journalist and I get it wrong when it comes to the deaths of millions of people, you would think there'd be a lot, like, if I was a chef and I undercooked chicken and someone died,
[01:12:36.889 --> 01:12:38.330]  You think there'd be a lot of hand-wringing?
[01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:39.891]  Maybe I'm in the wrong line of work?
[01:12:39.891 --> 01:12:43.793]  There is never this kind of self-reflection of what am I doing wrong?
[01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:45.795]  How did I screw this up so badly?
[01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:52.119]  So, I think it's crucial for people to understand, and I lay out the receipts in this book, that for over a hundred years,
[01:12:52.879 --> 01:13:19.994]  Every single atrocity, the Gulags, the Holodomor, the show trials, every single atrocity committed by the Soviet Union had Western reporters tripping over, and influencers, not just reporters, actors, writers, tripping over themselves to tell the American people, you don't understand, the Russians are great, you're backwards, you have these anti-communist prejudices, and this is the way we should have America be going toward.
[01:13:20.174 --> 01:13:30.860]  So they've been at this for a very long time, and to your point, you're just some loudmouth with a studio in Texas, and yet you, by yourself, are causing nationwide and international problems.
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:33.922]  That, to me, speaks to the weakness.
[01:13:33.922 --> 01:13:40.326]  If I'm trying to construct a narrative that is not based in reality, let's suppose I cheated my wife a lot.
[01:13:40.506 --> 01:13:41.106]  Right.
[01:13:41.106 --> 01:13:45.629]  She's just got to catch me once and my whole situation collapses.
[01:13:45.629 --> 01:14:03.420]  So when you point out day after day all the not just mistakes but lies that are being promulgated daily by the corporate press, it becomes so easy to demonstrate to critical thinking people that this is systemic and this is by design.
[01:14:04.895 --> 01:14:05.635]  Beautifully said.
[01:14:05.635 --> 01:14:10.078]  And let's be clear, because you're criticizing Russian tyranny, you're not a Russophobe.
[01:14:10.078 --> 01:14:14.021]  We're just looking at the evils in America, the evils in Ukraine, the evils in Russia.
[01:14:14.021 --> 01:14:17.983]  This is a real retrospective, so we don't repeat it again, which we are now.
[01:14:17.983 --> 01:14:19.224]  But you make a good point.
[01:14:19.224 --> 01:14:26.068]  For those that don't know history or forgot it, first Stalin was bad, then World War II comes, he's good, and then he's bad again.
[01:14:26.068 --> 01:14:33.653]  It's a perfect 1984, which George Orwell was writing about, where they're just shifting who the good guys and bad guys are on a routine basis.
[01:14:34.062 --> 01:14:42.284]  Yeah, and it's really kind of disturbing to me how, you know, it's very easy to make the case that, look, Hitler's the ultimate evil, we gotta team up with the devil to stop Hitler.
[01:14:42.284 --> 01:14:43.985]  You can make that argument pretty easily.
[01:14:43.985 --> 01:14:46.946]  And that's kind of alluded to when we're taught history in high school.
[01:14:46.946 --> 01:14:55.528]  But it's never explained just what Stalin did, just how bad he was, just what he did to his own people, and what he built on with Lenin.
[01:14:55.828 --> 01:15:04.390]  There's this big kind of lie, which I dissect in the book and demonstrate to be false, that Lenin was good and Stalin basically perverted it, or if Trotsky had been in charge it wouldn't have been as bad.
[01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:06.091]  This is complete nonsense.
[01:15:06.091 --> 01:15:10.332]  Everything that Stalin put into place had been originated under Lenin's system.
[01:15:10.332 --> 01:15:14.233]  The secret police, the gulags, you know, turning people against one another.
[01:15:14.233 --> 01:15:15.413]  It's all been there.
[01:15:15.413 --> 01:15:18.694]  And it's all been repeated again.
[01:15:18.694 --> 01:15:19.634]  If they had their druthers.
[01:15:20.134 --> 01:15:21.615]  That's the thing.
[01:15:21.615 --> 01:15:28.838]  I do not hold to this belief that those who I regard as the enemies of liberty are always going to get their way.
[01:15:28.838 --> 01:15:30.599]  Because, here's the proof.
[01:15:30.599 --> 01:15:34.140]  If that were true, no one listening to this show would have a gun.
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:36.921]  If they had their way, handguns would be illegal in this country.
[01:15:36.921 --> 01:15:38.022]  And that's why you're white-pilled.
[01:15:38.022 --> 01:15:43.064]  And I agree, we're winning and turning the tide, but I want people to know, Empire's going to strike back.
[01:15:43.684 --> 01:15:43.985]  Absolutely.
[01:15:43.985 --> 01:15:45.227]  These people are not weak.
[01:15:45.227 --> 01:15:46.390]  They have no shame.
[01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:47.632]  They have no remorse.
[01:15:47.632 --> 01:15:51.460]  But the point is, they're much closer to snakes than they are to gods.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:52.281]  Damn well said.
[01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:53.504]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:53.504 --> 01:15:53.944]  Stay with us.

[01:17:58.789 --> 01:18:00.790]  I've got some good news.
[01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:07.654]  Our high-quality supplements really work, and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[01:18:07.654 --> 01:18:08.494]  That's the good news.
[01:18:08.494 --> 01:18:09.635]  They're amazing.
[01:18:09.635 --> 01:18:17.820]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to InfoWarstore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:21.261]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the InfoWar.
[01:18:21.261 --> 01:18:26.184]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[01:18:26.184 --> 01:18:27.005]  Think what would happen.
[01:18:27.925 --> 01:18:41.474]  If those of you on the fence actually went to InfoWarStore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects, so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[01:18:41.474 --> 01:18:50.440]  Also, we've got the super high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones, as well.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:51.821]  Or Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:18:51.821 --> 01:18:56.244]  Just go try the product, fund the InfoWar, and help us defeat the New World Order together.
[01:18:56.244 --> 01:18:57.565]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:18:57.705 --> 01:18:58.766]  No.
[01:18:58.766 --> 01:19:01.490]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:06.356]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[01:19:06.356 --> 01:19:08.740]  And that war is something that we can win.
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:10.442]  But it takes dedication.
[01:19:10.442 --> 01:19:11.683]  It takes commitment.
[01:19:11.683 --> 01:19:13.546]  That's why I asked listeners respectfully.
[01:19:13.726 --> 01:19:22.393]  To go to InfoWarStore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[01:19:22.393 --> 01:19:37.666]  InfoWarStore.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World, Ultimate Bone Broth, Back in Stock, Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.

[01:19:40.467 --> 01:19:42.308]  Some of the very best products.
[01:19:42.308 --> 01:19:44.430]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWarsTore.
[01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:49.773]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWarsTore.
[01:19:49.773 --> 01:19:52.634]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[01:19:52.634 --> 01:19:53.995]  Plus, they keep us on air.
[01:19:53.995 --> 01:19:55.516]  So again, please take action.
[01:19:55.516 --> 01:19:59.598]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com today and I thank you.
[01:19:59.598 --> 01:20:05.502]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:14.152 --> 01:20:24.698]  Now listen up!
[01:20:24.698 --> 01:20:28.840]  She's a razor sharp!
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:30.801]  And she'll get her way!
[01:20:30.801 --> 01:20:36.103]  She'll slice you apart!
[01:20:36.103 --> 01:20:38.765]  Well, she's a cool, cool black!
[01:20:43.061 --> 01:20:51.149]  And if you get her name... Well, you might not make it back.
[01:20:51.149 --> 01:20:52.371]  Got the looks that kill.
[01:20:54.645 --> 01:20:56.546]  Well, Michael Malice is a smart cookie.
[01:20:56.546 --> 01:20:59.729]  And you should give people some of your background and history speaking to this.
[01:20:59.729 --> 01:21:02.550]  Because when I see your podcast, I watch it all the time.
[01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:03.291]  So does my family.
[01:21:03.291 --> 01:21:05.112]  You know what you're talking about.
[01:21:05.112 --> 01:21:07.013]  And it's amazing.
[01:21:07.013 --> 01:21:10.256]  But the good news is we are winning.
[01:21:10.256 --> 01:21:11.557]  Tyranny can be defeated.
[01:21:11.557 --> 01:21:14.278]  There are ways to defeat it, but we have to first recognize it.
[01:21:14.278 --> 01:21:14.839]  Please continue.
[01:21:15.259 --> 01:21:19.126]  Do you know what Ronald Reagan said before he was elected president?
[01:21:19.126 --> 01:21:25.458]  He sat down and they were discussing the Cold War and Ron DeSantis just invoked this in his speech at CPAC and this is one of the key points of the book.
[01:21:26.027 --> 01:21:30.470]  And he said to his aide, he goes, let me tell you my strategy for the Cold War.
[01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:33.492]  It is simple and some may say simplistic.
[01:21:33.492 --> 01:21:34.413]  Here it is.
[01:21:34.413 --> 01:21:35.434]  We win, they lose.
[01:21:35.434 --> 01:21:37.155]  What do you think about that?
[01:21:37.155 --> 01:21:39.336]  And they laughed in his face.
[01:21:39.336 --> 01:21:45.501]  They said that he is threatening us to get us into nuclear war, that he's a lunatic, he doesn't know what he's talking about, he's senile, he's a moron.
[01:21:46.121 --> 01:21:51.846]  Ten years later, eleven years later, this evil empire that spanned half the globe no longer ceased to exist.
[01:21:51.846 --> 01:21:59.792]  And one of the reasons I wrote this book, which I think is so key, is that this was a big victory for the West.
[01:21:59.792 --> 01:22:02.254]  And it was done relatively peacefully.
[01:22:02.254 --> 01:22:04.536]  We have monuments, understandably, to the Vietnam War.
[01:22:04.536 --> 01:22:07.838]  We have monuments to World War II, where so many people gave their lives.
[01:22:07.838 --> 01:22:14.944]  But the Cold War, which was won basically without firing a shot, without the loss of millions of lives and so much bloodshed,
[01:22:15.464 --> 01:22:17.344]  It's forgotten, and no one discusses it.
[01:22:17.344 --> 01:22:18.505]  Because they hate it.
[01:22:18.505 --> 01:22:20.265]  And you can't expect the New York Times to tell this story.
[01:22:20.265 --> 01:22:24.566]  Well, it turned out Herbert Walker Bush, who was his Vice President, didn't like it, because they wanted that foreign enemy.
[01:22:24.566 --> 01:22:25.126]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:22:25.126 --> 01:22:35.849]  Herbert Walker Bush told Gorbachev in writing, no one wants to see disintegration of the Soviet Union, or I forgot the exact word he used, something to that effect.
[01:22:36.249 --> 01:22:47.673]  So they wanted to have that bipolar world where we're the good guys, they're the bad guys, and that justifies any kind of military build-up possible and any restraints on Western freedoms possible.
[01:22:47.673 --> 01:22:59.897]  William F. Buckley, who I'm still pissed that you have his picture up in the green room and that every guest of the show has to look at his face, had said, we need dictatorship here in the West to fight the dictatorship in the East temporarily.
[01:22:59.897 --> 01:23:02.998]  By the way, I'm no follower of William F. Buckley.
[01:23:02.998 --> 01:23:04.359]  Bring me the photo right now.
[01:23:05.179 --> 01:23:07.620]  Can you just put it in the bathroom where it belongs, please?
[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:10.002]  No, a listener mailed that to us.
[01:23:10.002 --> 01:23:10.862]  You can hang it in the bathroom.
[01:23:10.862 --> 01:23:13.183]  And most of the stuff on the walls, listeners mailed us, okay?
[01:23:13.183 --> 01:23:18.486]  So we're not like museum curators going, this is a symbol of who we are.
[01:23:18.486 --> 01:23:21.088]  It was just a piece of history, and that's why we have it.
[01:23:21.088 --> 01:23:22.028]  I'm going to give it to you.
[01:23:22.028 --> 01:23:22.529]  I don't want it!
[01:23:23.169 --> 01:23:24.450]  No, no, I'm going to give it to you.
[01:23:24.450 --> 01:23:27.433]  You may keep it or torture it or whatever you want.
[01:23:27.433 --> 01:23:28.274]  Bring it to me.
[01:23:28.274 --> 01:23:29.194]  Bring it to me.
[01:23:29.194 --> 01:23:31.416]  No, no, no, but getting serious here.
[01:23:31.416 --> 01:23:34.699]  There's no special secret message in it, but I get what you're saying.
[01:23:34.699 --> 01:23:36.941]  Here's where I'm at.
[01:23:36.941 --> 01:23:40.644]  We have corporate interests that want us to stare into the abyss of Russia and China right now.
[01:23:40.644 --> 01:23:40.904]  Yes.
[01:23:40.904 --> 01:23:43.467]  In the name of defeating them, we become them.
[01:23:43.467 --> 01:23:44.768]  You just talked about that.
[01:23:44.768 --> 01:23:45.909]  How do we thread the needle on that?
[01:23:46.533 --> 01:23:50.938]  Well, I think the most important thing, this was crucial to bringing down the Soviet Union.
[01:23:50.938 --> 01:23:54.682]  It's crucial to helping what's happening in North Korea right now, which is my other bailiwick.
[01:23:54.682 --> 01:23:55.543]  Yeah, you take it as a hostage.
[01:23:55.543 --> 01:23:56.044]  It's yours.
[01:23:56.044 --> 01:23:56.384]  It's a gift.
[01:23:56.384 --> 01:23:57.686]  Oh, God, help us.
[01:23:57.686 --> 01:23:58.246]  Okay.
[01:23:58.246 --> 01:23:59.688]  Oh, it's heavy.
[01:23:59.688 --> 01:24:00.369]  That's yours now.
[01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:03.853]  Oh, my skin's burning just touching it.
[01:24:03.853 --> 01:24:05.575]  And the name of the show speaks to this.
[01:24:05.575 --> 01:24:06.135]  Information.
[01:24:07.016 --> 01:24:09.738]  It's not necessarily a matter of having the weapons.
[01:24:09.738 --> 01:24:12.159]  It's not necessarily a matter of having the numbers.
[01:24:12.159 --> 01:24:18.502]  It's a matter of having enough people understanding what is being going on and the motivations behind them.
[01:24:18.502 --> 01:24:22.163]  Now I want to talk to people at home for them to appreciate what we're up against.
[01:24:22.163 --> 01:24:31.988]  Because if someone is blue-pilled, and we can talk about all the pills in a second, meaning someone is blue-pilled is that they believe that what is on the news is by and large true and in their best interest.
[01:24:31.988 --> 01:24:33.169]  Imagine sitting someone down
[01:24:33.829 --> 01:24:34.189]  I don't know.
[01:24:52.581 --> 01:24:56.063]  Once you take that red pill, you realize, oh, these are corporations.
[01:24:56.063 --> 01:24:57.564]  Corporations have an agenda.
[01:24:57.564 --> 01:25:02.687]  That agenda is often not in the favor of the citizenry or even the people working there.
[01:25:02.687 --> 01:25:04.708]  All of a sudden, a lot of things start to make sense.
[01:25:04.708 --> 01:25:08.791]  Well, I was about to say, I don't get much pushback now, and I don't talk about myself.
[01:25:08.791 --> 01:25:09.932]  It's a gauge.
[01:25:09.932 --> 01:25:11.513]  Most folks aren't a public figure.
[01:25:11.513 --> 01:25:16.576]  I went from almost nothing but love before Trump, but it was only like every 30th person I walked by was a listener.
[01:25:17.116 --> 01:25:22.822]  Then under Trump, I would get mobbed, but about 5%, 10% were hate, but still mainly love.
[01:25:22.822 --> 01:25:25.385]  Now, I go all over the country, nothing but love.
[01:25:25.385 --> 01:25:26.667]  People get there being lied to.
[01:25:26.667 --> 01:25:28.188]  I think we've reached the tipping point.
[01:25:28.188 --> 01:25:29.249]  Yeah, and here's the other thing.
[01:25:29.249 --> 01:25:34.035]  A lot of times people are depressed because they're like, oh, the majority of people aren't going to ever come around to our land thinking.
[01:25:34.035 --> 01:25:34.876]  It doesn't take a majority.
[01:25:35.316 --> 01:25:37.579]  Because the majority are just going to be on the bandwagon.
[01:25:37.579 --> 01:25:42.305]  So one year they're going to be hardcore George W. Bush fans, the next year they're going to be Obama fans.
[01:25:42.305 --> 01:25:44.047]  They're just going to go with the tide.
[01:25:44.047 --> 01:25:48.533]  All it takes is a significant, informed minority dedicated... I agree.
[01:25:48.533 --> 01:25:51.057]  So how would you quantify and describe the moment history we're in right now?
[01:25:51.822 --> 01:25:55.163]  I agree with you completely that this is an inflection point.
[01:25:55.163 --> 01:26:10.146]  The fact that you have even one social media site where corporate journalists aren't protected and felt safe, this is unprecedented and this is wonderful because on Twitter they will spread their lies and immediately dozens of citizens will call them out on their depravity.
[01:26:10.146 --> 01:26:12.327]  That's right, tyranny can only work when it's got complete control.
[01:26:12.907 --> 01:26:14.128]  Yes, it has to.
[01:26:14.128 --> 01:26:16.310]  It's called totalitarianism for a reason.
[01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:18.553]  It has to have total control.
[01:26:18.553 --> 01:26:28.202]  Here's the thing, if the worst thing you could say about America is that you go to school and you learn some stupid things that aren't true and everything else is fine, we could take that as a compromise.
[01:26:28.542 --> 01:26:29.083]  Right?
[01:26:29.083 --> 01:26:35.350]  The point is, they have to be in your music, in your supermarket, in your bedroom, they have to be everywhere.
[01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:37.312]  God, that sounds exhausting!
[01:26:37.312 --> 01:26:41.577]  I can't even run my own life, much less, what is it about the totalitarians and these globalists?
[01:26:41.577 --> 01:26:45.362]  They, throughout history, they want to run everything in control, but that sounds hellish!
[01:26:46.142 --> 01:26:49.024]  But the other thing is, Alex, which is important, it's also expensive.
[01:26:49.024 --> 01:26:50.265]  You said it was exhausting.
[01:26:50.265 --> 01:26:58.370]  If I'm going to run every aspect of everyone's life, that costs me a lot in terms of emotional cost, people pushing back, financial cost, technological cost.
[01:26:58.370 --> 01:27:00.512]  Whereas you could just lead them with a better system.
[01:27:00.512 --> 01:27:02.753]  But it's also the fact that this is why they're vulnerable.
[01:27:02.753 --> 01:27:08.557]  Because the more money and more effort it takes for me to maintain my system, the harder it is for me to sustain it.
[01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:15.642]  People have this idea that if China had this big empire over the world, as they certainly would want to do, that it would be easy for them.
[01:27:16.042 --> 01:27:16.963]  It's not.
[01:27:16.963 --> 01:27:19.965]  These giant empires are not structurally sound.
[01:27:19.965 --> 01:27:25.430]  Well, just like Hitler or just like the Japanese in World War II, they expanded because they were collapsing internally.
[01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:26.271]  Right.
[01:27:26.271 --> 01:27:32.276]  It's the kind of thing where it's like Wile E. Coyote runs off the cliff and then when he looks down he falls because he realizes gravity is there.
[01:27:32.276 --> 01:27:40.903]  You can't keep these things going on infinitely because at certain points, like Thatcher said, she's on the cover of the book, the problem with socialism is eventually you run out of other people's money.
[01:27:42.128 --> 01:27:47.931]  We gotta go to break again, longer segment's coming up, but again, inflection point, so we're at a crossroads.
[01:27:47.931 --> 01:27:53.893]  I think we're at a major crossroads, and I do want to talk about Trump after the break, because he said some things recently that I think I want to hear your thoughts on.
[01:27:53.893 --> 01:27:57.395]  Absolutely, but in the minute we have left, tell people about the book where they can get it.
[01:27:57.395 --> 01:28:05.719]  YpillBook.com, and I've been delighted by, I was out selling Pompeo, Mike Pompeo, so when you have a situation like that, truly that's room for hope.
[01:28:05.719 --> 01:28:07.420]  Yeah, Pompeo is truly a bad person.
[01:28:09.324 --> 01:28:16.732]  So, recently he was attacking Trump for policies that he helped formulate.
[01:28:16.732 --> 01:28:23.199]  I think the Republican Party are delusional because they believe the corporate media narrative that once Trump goes away, they're going to return to normal.
[01:28:23.199 --> 01:28:27.364]  And if you look at the base of the GOP, they have no hunger for going back.
[01:28:27.364 --> 01:28:29.286]  They're totally populist radicalized.
[01:28:29.486 --> 01:28:31.288]  There's no hunger for 2015.
[01:28:31.288 --> 01:28:32.168]  Zero.
[01:28:32.168 --> 01:28:37.352]  And if Mike Pence and Nikki Haley think they've got a shot, maybe they can get a shot at the nomination at the establishment.
[01:28:37.352 --> 01:28:38.673]  They're being booed everywhere!
[01:28:38.673 --> 01:28:41.435]  But they're being booed to their face, and they don't know how to handle it.
[01:28:41.435 --> 01:28:45.719]  Except for being this corporate politician who pretends it's not happening.
[01:28:45.719 --> 01:28:48.661]  Okay, we're taking the white pill with Michael Malin straight ahead.
[01:28:48.661 --> 01:28:49.622]  Stay with us.
[01:28:49.622 --> 01:28:52.884]  InfoWars.com forward slash show is the accordance of freedom.
[01:28:52.884 --> 01:28:54.606]  InfoWars.com, banned out video.
[01:28:59.594 --> 01:29:07.798]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the Globals, in their own words, plan for our future.
[01:29:07.798 --> 01:29:09.259]  That is a hellish future.
[01:29:09.259 --> 01:29:18.663]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarshore.com.
[01:29:18.663 --> 01:29:24.266]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:29:24.266 --> 01:29:26.227]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:29:26.827 --> 01:29:32.209]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHore.com.
[01:29:32.209 --> 01:29:36.151]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:29:36.151 --> 01:29:42.034]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:29:42.034 --> 01:29:44.115]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[01:29:44.875 --> 01:29:45.476]  We're good to go.
[01:30:01.536 --> 01:30:11.949]  I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsaw.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body and keep us on air.
[01:30:11.949 --> 01:30:16.274]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in
[01:30:16.855 --> 01:30:17.296]  We're good to go.
[01:30:33.516 --> 01:30:35.037]  But we need funds to operate.
[01:30:35.037 --> 01:30:43.882]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our Fizzy Magnesium, and our Sleep Aid, and our Nitric Oxide, and our Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:30:43.882 --> 01:30:46.343]  All of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[01:30:46.343 --> 01:30:48.124]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[01:30:48.124 --> 01:30:49.425]  So get off the bench.
[01:30:49.425 --> 01:30:50.285]  Get in the game.
[01:30:50.285 --> 01:30:57.029]  Step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now, and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:01.050 --> 01:31:10.753]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[01:31:10.753 --> 01:31:14.435]  We can't stay on air without your help, and I want to thank you all for your past support.
[01:31:14.435 --> 01:31:21.377]  And I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products at InfoWarsTore.com to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[01:31:21.937 --> 01:31:26.180]  Ultimate Bone Broth, finally sold out for over two years, back in stock.
[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:28.921]  Real Red Pill Plus, simply amazing.
[01:31:28.921 --> 01:31:31.183]  Nitric, boosts what it does for your heart.
[01:31:31.183 --> 01:31:32.924]  Cardiovascular, critical.
[01:31:32.924 --> 01:31:40.969]  All these products, like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Supermelt Vitality, they're all available and in stock, ready to ship to you, right now on InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:40.969 --> 01:31:49.894]  And the final 1,200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, and I'm not gonna sign anymore after that, are exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com as well.
[01:31:50.094 --> 01:31:52.536]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[01:31:52.536 --> 01:31:53.416]  We didn't have them for sale.
[01:31:53.416 --> 01:31:54.978]  But now, I signed the last books.
[01:31:54.978 --> 01:32:00.462]  You can get them right now.
[01:32:00.462 --> 01:32:03.604]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:32:03.604 --> 01:32:05.926]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:32:05.926 --> 01:32:09.849]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:32:09.849 --> 01:32:13.772]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:32:15.222 --> 01:32:18.766]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:32:18.766 --> 01:32:25.654]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[01:32:25.654 --> 01:32:26.555]  It's really just incredible.
[01:32:27.586 --> 01:32:31.229]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:32:31.229 --> 01:32:37.014]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:32:37.014 --> 01:32:48.283]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it, but most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:32:48.923 --> 01:32:53.266]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:32:53.266 --> 01:32:58.228]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsaw.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:32:58.228 --> 01:33:00.189]  Please take action now.
[01:33:00.189 --> 01:33:06.073]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.241 --> 01:33:30.983]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.983 --> 01:33:32.144]  With the great Michael Malice.
[01:33:32.144 --> 01:33:33.685]  Let me tell you a little story about censorship.
[01:33:33.685 --> 01:33:36.566]  We'll get more into this in the next hour with Michael Malice.
[01:33:36.566 --> 01:33:45.670]  But since they banned us four years ago, they banned any even sub-URL we use to push people to InfoWars.com or Band.Video.
[01:33:45.670 --> 01:33:48.872]  And so sometimes they ban stuff in a week, sometimes they go three months.
[01:33:48.872 --> 01:33:50.973]  We've had dozens of URLs since this happened.
[01:33:52.017 --> 01:33:59.960]  But about a month ago we created ConspiracyFact.info that would take you to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:03.561]  So our guests and other people that ever come along can say, hey, I'm going live on the show.
[01:34:03.561 --> 01:34:05.081]  Here's the URL.
[01:34:05.081 --> 01:34:09.002]  Well, Roseanne Barr was going to be in studio Saturday, and she was.
[01:34:09.002 --> 01:34:10.723]  And so I went live at noon.
[01:34:10.723 --> 01:34:12.404]  She was going to be on at one.
[01:34:12.404 --> 01:34:15.505]  Before the show, we checked ConspiracyFact.info.
[01:34:15.505 --> 01:34:16.545]  You could post a link to Twitter.
[01:34:17.475 --> 01:34:19.516]  I said, hey, that's the link to post, blah, blah, blah.
[01:34:19.516 --> 01:34:20.317]  She puts it out.
[01:34:20.317 --> 01:34:21.817]  Wouldn't let her put it out.
[01:34:21.817 --> 01:34:22.958]  Won't let you put it out now.
[01:34:22.958 --> 01:34:24.299]  ConspiracyFact.info.
[01:34:24.299 --> 01:34:33.163]  So, the new URL, and while we have thousands of people trying to ban these, the new URL, we'll put it on screen for you right now, is MadMaxWorld.tv.
[01:34:34.588 --> 01:34:41.217]  Because with them creating all the crime and letting it flourish and all of it, we're entering a Mad Max world with the energy being cut off.
[01:34:41.217 --> 01:34:46.525]  That's what caused the fictional Mad Max novel, you know, where the energy's cut off, oil runs out.
[01:34:46.525 --> 01:34:51.512]  MadMaxWorld.tv will take you directly to Bandot Video.
[01:34:52.112 --> 01:34:56.837]  Share any link, it creates its own URLs, and for now that is a link they're not banning.
[01:34:56.837 --> 01:34:59.480]  Madmaxworld.tv.
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:01.062]  Michael Malice, please continue.
[01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:03.864]  I'm just, is there a whole, what is the point of this?
[01:35:03.864 --> 01:35:06.827]  Because again, is this, are they just trying to play whack-a-mole with you?
[01:35:06.827 --> 01:35:10.892]  They could just, if they knock off one URL, a URL costs $10 to create.
[01:35:10.892 --> 01:35:11.632]  What is their purpose?
[01:35:12.429 --> 01:35:14.850]  As long as the listeners get excited and promote it, they lose, exactly.
[01:35:14.850 --> 01:35:18.072]  Yeah, I mean... They're trying to exhaust us, we gotta exhaust them.
[01:35:18.072 --> 01:35:23.855]  But that's just... I mean, if I wanted to take down Alex Jones, like, this is all I... This is another... It just speaks to my point.
[01:35:23.855 --> 01:35:24.936]  Like, this is all you've got?
[01:35:24.936 --> 01:35:27.677]  That you're gonna knock off a URL, cost him ten bucks?
[01:35:27.677 --> 01:35:28.318]  Okay.
[01:35:28.318 --> 01:35:29.618]  So, you just change the URL.
[01:35:29.618 --> 01:35:30.839]  It just takes two seconds.
[01:35:30.839 --> 01:35:33.020]  If they had their druthers, this show wouldn't exist.
[01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:35.121]  And that you'd be vanished into some gulag.
[01:35:35.121 --> 01:35:37.943]  This is another reason why it's important for people to have perspective.
[01:35:38.223 --> 01:35:38.624]  I don't know.
[01:35:51.004 --> 01:35:51.924]  Well, we're really evil.
[01:35:51.924 --> 01:35:54.185]  We're criticizing Stalin, Lenin, and Hitler.
[01:35:54.185 --> 01:35:54.745]  Yeah, right.
[01:35:54.745 --> 01:35:57.105]  Yeah, my God.
[01:35:57.105 --> 01:35:57.925]  Well, no, no, no.
[01:35:57.925 --> 01:35:58.465]  Hold on.
[01:35:58.465 --> 01:36:06.327]  There's a chapter in this book about someone who I know you know a lot about, and it's going to raise the dander on the back of your neck, and that's Henry Wallace.
[01:36:06.327 --> 01:36:10.407]  So, Henry, people in this country, you're not taught this in school.
[01:36:10.407 --> 01:36:14.068]  Henry Wallace was Roosevelt's, FDR's, second vice president.
[01:36:14.068 --> 01:36:19.189]  He was very close to, not literally Stalin, but Stalinist operatives.
[01:36:20.089 --> 01:36:23.110]  He went to visit a gulag.
[01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:25.911]  He went to visit all the way in Siberia.
[01:36:25.911 --> 01:36:28.953]  They put on a literal song and dance for him.
[01:36:28.953 --> 01:36:29.993]  The prisoners.
[01:36:29.993 --> 01:36:34.835]  And they took him around, because he was former, he had a background in agriculture.
[01:36:34.835 --> 01:36:37.996]  They take him to a pig farm and he's asking, oh, how are you raising these pigs?
[01:36:37.996 --> 01:36:40.958]  Now, the people operating the pig farm weren't the prisoner farmers.
[01:36:40.958 --> 01:36:42.118]  They were operatchiks.
[01:36:42.118 --> 01:36:45.319]  So they just didn't know what to answer him, so the translators had to cover.
[01:36:45.319 --> 01:36:46.620]  So he's, and he comes back.
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:51.765]  And he says, there's no two countries more alike than the United States and the Soviet Union.
[01:36:51.765 --> 01:36:54.408]  And it's like a new wild, he says, it's like a Wild West.
[01:36:54.408 --> 01:36:57.152]  All of these Russians are moving to Siberia.
[01:36:57.152 --> 01:36:58.673]  It's just a new frontier for them.
[01:36:58.673 --> 01:37:02.758]  Well, they're moving there because they were all arrested for no reason.
[01:37:02.758 --> 01:37:06.362]  And they're all prisoner slaves having to... You said that would raise my hackle.
[01:37:06.482 --> 01:37:07.242]  I totally agree with you.
[01:37:07.242 --> 01:37:09.423]  Well, no, no, I'm just mentioning Henry Wallace's name.
[01:37:09.423 --> 01:37:14.704]  It's just one of those names where, like, he's not household knowledge, but he should be more prominent.
[01:37:14.704 --> 01:37:20.726]  And the other thing is, there was a woman, Eleanor Lipper and others, who were prisoners on the other side of the fence.
[01:37:20.726 --> 01:37:21.947]  They were there.
[01:37:21.947 --> 01:37:27.008]  And when she escaped, because she was a foreign national and wrote a book about it, he looked like a complete fool.
[01:37:27.008 --> 01:37:33.130]  And in 1952, which would have been the last of his second term if he had been elected president, as he had tried to do,
[01:37:33.630 --> 01:37:39.594]  Uh, when he ran against Truman, um, and Dewey in, in 1948, uh, he admitted, oh, communism's evil.
[01:37:39.594 --> 01:37:47.079]  It's like, yeah, you're saying this now eight years in, but you were a complete fool for this and God... Well, that's kind of like the poison shots.
[01:37:47.079 --> 01:37:54.964]  We were this close to having Henry Wallace be president because it's what, like a hundred days into FDR's fourth term that Truman got sworn in.
[01:37:54.964 --> 01:37:59.067]  So people don't appreciate just how bad things could have been in the past.
[01:37:59.067 --> 01:38:01.289]  And that's another reason why I'm so hopeful about the future.
[01:38:01.289 --> 01:38:01.589]  Go ahead.
[01:38:01.589 --> 01:38:02.089]  Absolutely.
[01:38:02.089 --> 01:38:03.150]  Well, I was just going to say that,
[01:38:04.312 --> 01:38:09.261]  I forgot what I was going to say, but it is an amazing moment to be alive right now.
[01:38:09.758 --> 01:38:32.996]  Well, absolutely, but again, so much of what we are taught in popular consciousness and in school is just a very narrow sliver of history, and it's designed, in many cases, to demoralize Americans and to see them in a certain kind of path, to make them think that the rise of the state is inevitable, and that progress means the growth of government and the loss of liberties.
[01:38:32.996 --> 01:38:37.780]  They've been singing this song for a hundred years, and as long as I have breath in my body, they're not going to have their way.
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:41.505]  Hopefully everyone listening to this will agree with me on that regard.
[01:38:41.505 --> 01:38:47.853]  So, projecting the research and the history of your book and your own family history, what is your view on the conflict in Ukraine?
[01:38:48.696 --> 01:38:50.817]  I am completely ignorant about this.
[01:38:50.817 --> 01:38:58.259]  Here's my view, because people have this idea, because I was born in Ukraine, I left there when I was one and a half, that I'm going to have some kind of inside knowledge.
[01:38:58.259 --> 01:39:00.579]  What I do know a lot about is North Korea.
[01:39:00.579 --> 01:39:09.301]  And my big concern is the parallels to the Korean War, because in the North you had the Chinese and the Russians, in the South you had the US and the UN.
[01:39:09.301 --> 01:39:11.102]  The Korean people were the ones who lost that war.
[01:39:11.442 --> 01:39:12.483]  What else was a tie?
[01:39:12.483 --> 01:39:13.985]  The country was leveled.
[01:39:13.985 --> 01:39:15.226]  They were bombed to oblivion.
[01:39:15.226 --> 01:39:20.252]  All things that were left were like the chimneys and just these entire countrysides were laid to ruin.
[01:39:20.252 --> 01:39:28.642]  And my big fear, my big fear is for the Russian people and for the Ukrainian people that this is going to be a proxy war and the Ukrainian people are going to pay the price.
[01:39:28.642 --> 01:39:29.043]  Exactly.
[01:39:29.043 --> 01:39:29.804]  They're the losers.
[01:39:29.804 --> 01:39:30.445]  The war is bad.
[01:39:31.085 --> 01:39:44.673]  And anytime you have all this pressure on Zelensky or Ukrainians not to kind of reach some compromise, and I can understand the argument, like, oh, you're not going to validate aggression, and Thatcher was very big on this with the Falklands when Argentina invaded, you can't negotiate with people who aggress.
[01:39:44.673 --> 01:39:50.556]  Point being, at what cost, and are you just going to fund the Ukrainians until they're completely destroyed?
[01:39:50.556 --> 01:39:52.737]  Are you planning on taking Putin out?
[01:39:52.737 --> 01:39:53.698]  What's that going to look like?
[01:39:53.698 --> 01:39:58.261]  It's certainly not going to be easy to do, so... And we just showed some footage of US weapons
[01:39:59.161 --> 01:40:00.001]  We're good.
[01:40:15.749 --> 01:40:22.912]  At a certain point, if you're funding this war and you're funneling weapons there, you can understand why Putin is going to hit New York or something else.
[01:40:22.912 --> 01:40:25.333]  It would make perfect sense for him to do that.
[01:40:25.333 --> 01:40:30.855]  I don't have any information about what's going on over there, but I do have concerns and those are my concerns.
[01:40:31.235 --> 01:40:37.420]  Well, my concerns are, I'm not a Russian, I'm not a Ukrainian, and I see that both sides have a historical beast with each other.
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:39.381]  Sure, with good reason, yeah.
[01:40:39.381 --> 01:40:46.567]  But the east of Ukraine, it's mainly Russian, and if the Russians were putting troops on our border, we would be really, really upset.
[01:40:46.567 --> 01:40:51.190]  And so, if Putin was putting troops in Canada or Mexico, I'd be upset.
[01:40:51.190 --> 01:40:58.255]  And so, now that NATO's openly involved, I even saw a CNN report and a Washington Post report and a New York Times report going, oh my God!
[01:40:59.236 --> 01:41:01.619]  All the dead Russians are making the Russians want more war.
[01:41:01.619 --> 01:41:02.400]  Well, of course!
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.282]  I mean, this is escalating.
[01:41:04.282 --> 01:41:05.764]  They need experts to tell them that?
[01:41:05.764 --> 01:41:06.905]  That's just history.
[01:41:06.905 --> 01:41:13.613]  Yeah, but I think the bloodlust by the corporate press for war cannot be overstated.
[01:41:14.513 --> 01:41:18.076]  They have not been a war that they don't like.
[01:41:18.076 --> 01:41:20.197]  If it bleeds, it leads, is kind of that slogan.
[01:41:20.197 --> 01:41:21.978]  That is my concern.
[01:41:21.978 --> 01:41:34.386]  The New York Times, for a very long time, has had a history of being... It's just funny because if you read... Most people think, okay, New York Times is left, left is anti-war, conservatives, pro-military, pro-war.
[01:41:34.386 --> 01:41:42.672]  The New York Times has been the biggest outlet for warmongering that would make the biggest war hawk in the Republican Party blush.
[01:41:43.012 --> 01:41:44.353]  Back to the Spanish-American War.
[01:41:44.353 --> 01:41:50.336]  Yes, and the thing is they could do it shamelessly because they can say, oh, we're the lefties, so we're not really pro-war.
[01:41:50.336 --> 01:41:55.920]  It's such a con job and it's just very disheartening to see how many people fall for it.
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:05.225]  And my, again, like you just said earlier, I want peace and I want people to be safe and secure in their own homes and not have to worry about bombs flying and people becoming orphans.
[01:42:05.225 --> 01:42:06.406]  What's your gut tell you?
[01:42:06.406 --> 01:42:08.127]  Because they're saying this war isn't going to last years now.
[01:42:09.581 --> 01:42:12.504]  God, I don't know what my gut is telling me.
[01:42:12.504 --> 01:42:15.447]  And I don't think Biden is a strong leader, to put it mildly.
[01:42:15.447 --> 01:42:25.778]  I don't know what the forces are behind that White House, but it seems very, very clear that all the pressure is on continuous war as much as possible, which is just very disturbing to see.
[01:42:26.118 --> 01:42:27.559]  All right, I want to shift gears out of that now.
[01:42:27.559 --> 01:42:28.839]  I want to go back to White Pill.
[01:42:28.839 --> 01:42:30.860]  Why you're optimistic, I am too.
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:35.382]  Because as bad as things are, the amount of people not buying the system is better than ever.
[01:42:35.382 --> 01:42:39.303]  I don't think we can just oppose the corrupt globalist system.
[01:42:39.303 --> 01:42:41.464]  We've got to create something new.
[01:42:41.464 --> 01:42:43.065]  Yes, I think that's a great way of looking at it.
[01:42:43.065 --> 01:42:45.426]  The White Pill, to be precise, I'm going to be a little pedantic.
[01:42:45.426 --> 01:42:46.687]  The White Pill isn't optimism.
[01:42:46.687 --> 01:42:47.427]  The White Pill is hope.
[01:42:48.027 --> 01:42:55.649]  And if you're going to sit here and tell me that as Americans, our journey toward freedom and taking our country back is hopeless, I don't want to talk to you.
[01:42:55.649 --> 01:42:56.889]  All right, let's talk about it when we come back.
[01:42:56.889 --> 01:42:58.750]  Yep.
[01:42:58.750 --> 01:43:07.212]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars has proven itself in the last 28 years to be over the globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants.
[01:43:07.212 --> 01:43:12.653]  And we fund our operation with viewers and listeners' support while selling you great products at the same time.
[01:43:12.653 --> 01:43:17.014]  So on it, thank all the viewers and listeners who have supported us over the years by spreading the word.
[01:43:17.654 --> 01:43:19.754]  I'm praying for the broadcast and I'm buying product.
[01:43:19.754 --> 01:43:36.838]  But I really want to encourage those of you that have been on the fence, that have never actually gone to Infowarshore.com to go there and get the great books and films and supplements and survival gear that's there that won't just empower you and enrich your life, but again will keep this broadcast transmitting.
[01:43:36.838 --> 01:43:40.659]  So whether it's Real Red Pill Plus or our super high quality CBD oil or the 50% off
[01:43:41.539 --> 01:43:42.299]  This is their big move.
[01:43:42.299 --> 01:43:45.601]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:43:45.601 --> 01:43:46.042]  He doesn't care.
[01:44:10.356 --> 01:44:11.618]  That's not his job.
[01:44:11.618 --> 01:44:13.360]  He's not the President of the United States.
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:17.224]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:44:17.224 --> 01:44:21.729]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:44:21.729 --> 01:44:22.851]  They must be opposed.
[01:44:23.462 --> 01:44:26.885]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[01:44:26.885 --> 01:44:28.066]  No.
[01:44:28.066 --> 01:44:28.907]  No.
[01:44:28.907 --> 01:44:29.668]  No.
[01:44:29.668 --> 01:44:30.568]  Exactly.
[01:44:30.568 --> 01:44:34.132]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:44:34.132 --> 01:44:37.234]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:44:37.234 --> 01:44:39.717]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:44:39.717 --> 01:44:42.219]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:44:42.219 --> 01:44:45.842]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:44:45.842 --> 01:44:48.364]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[01:44:48.364 --> 01:44:48.765]  You're right.
[01:44:49.045 --> 01:44:53.791]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[01:44:53.791 --> 01:44:55.334]  And we say no to your war!
[01:44:59.153 --> 01:45:03.314]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:45:03.314 --> 01:45:06.915]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[01:45:06.915 --> 01:45:09.435]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[01:45:09.435 --> 01:45:12.296]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:45:12.296 --> 01:45:15.156]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:45:15.156 --> 01:45:19.637]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and computer guns.
[01:45:19.637 --> 01:45:23.018]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[01:45:23.018 --> 01:45:26.999]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:45:26.999 --> 01:45:28.679]  It was almost as if it were a plan
[01:45:29.099 --> 01:45:31.600]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:32.200]  Stop!
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:32.540]  Stop!
[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:34.941]  Stop!
[01:45:34.941 --> 01:45:37.081]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:45:37.081 --> 01:45:38.702]  They are nothing but distractions.
[01:45:38.702 --> 01:45:41.502]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[01:45:41.502 --> 01:45:43.383]  You silenced those voices.
[01:45:43.383 --> 01:45:47.564]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[01:45:47.564 --> 01:45:53.546]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[01:45:58.931 --> 01:46:01.653]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:46:01.653 --> 01:46:06.516]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[01:46:06.516 --> 01:46:11.839]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[01:46:11.839 --> 01:46:21.866]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to mfullmorestore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.

[01:46:49.933 --> 01:46:52.834]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[01:46:52.834 --> 01:46:54.154]  Plus, they keep us on air.
[01:46:54.154 --> 01:46:55.675]  So again, please take action.
[01:46:55.675 --> 01:46:59.696]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com today and I thank you.
[01:46:59.696 --> 01:47:05.598]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:22.659 --> 01:47:32.046]  So, Michael Malice was rightfully complaining about my William F. Buckley picture that a listener sent us that we hung on the wall.
[01:47:32.046 --> 01:47:33.867]  She goes, this is interesting.
[01:47:33.867 --> 01:47:35.628]  We have all sorts of interesting photos here.
[01:47:35.628 --> 01:47:38.991]  But I said, what do you want to use as white-pilled examples
[01:47:40.177 --> 01:47:47.499]  When we come back of Global Awakening Against Tyranny, you said, I want to talk about East Germany versus West Germany, East Berlin versus West Berlin.
[01:47:47.499 --> 01:47:51.341]  I said, well, I've got a photo, I've got a picture that's actually mine.
[01:47:51.341 --> 01:47:59.383]  My mother came back from Germany, probably, she's been there many times, 20 years ago, and she was at a museum about the fall of the Berlin Wall.
[01:47:59.383 --> 01:48:00.944]  I'm going to get a boom operator in here, we can show you this.
[01:48:02.094 --> 01:48:18.405]  And it's a photo, a famous photo in the Berlin Wall, a few years before it fell, where a child went through with their parents but got caught in the barbed wire, and then an East German soldier took the child, saved the child, got him through, but that East German soldier disappeared, and no one knew whatever happened to him.
[01:48:18.405 --> 01:48:19.105]  Here, I can do it this way.
[01:48:21.892 --> 01:48:22.873]  There you go.
[01:48:22.873 --> 01:48:25.874]  So this is where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:25.874 --> 01:48:28.916]  And this is one of the photos on the wall that's actually one of mine.
[01:48:28.916 --> 01:48:29.657]  Isn't that beautiful?
[01:48:29.657 --> 01:48:30.937]  And so you wanted to go there next.
[01:48:30.937 --> 01:48:31.458]  Go ahead.
[01:48:31.458 --> 01:48:37.001]  Well, first of all, I just want to clarify, when you put in those terms, the idea of hanging William F. Buckley now sounds more appealing to me.
[01:48:37.381 --> 01:48:39.563]  So maybe I was a little bit wrong.
[01:48:39.563 --> 01:48:41.024]  There's someone named Konrad Schumann.
[01:48:41.024 --> 01:48:51.674]  Konrad Schumann was, you know, what people don't appreciate, I think a lot of people don't realize, the Berlin Wall, Berlin isn't in the center of East and West Germany.
[01:48:51.674 --> 01:48:54.376]  It's entirely enclosed in Eastern Germany.
[01:48:54.376 --> 01:49:03.064]  So when they built the wall, they surrounded the entire half of the city and it was a bizarre prison in that the people who were imprisoned were the free ones.
[01:49:03.524 --> 01:49:11.210]  Yeah, if you were a member, a citizen of West Berlin, that's part of West Germany, it was not contiguous with the liberal democratic West Germany.
[01:49:11.210 --> 01:49:19.517]  So there was an officer, Konrad Schumann, as they were trying to build the Berlin Wall and imprison the citizens of West Berlin.
[01:49:19.517 --> 01:49:24.280]  And he, it would be his job if someone's trying to cross this wall to shoot them.
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:26.983]  And he's this young kid and he's like, I can't do this.
[01:49:27.663 --> 01:49:31.906]  I cannot shoot my countrymen just because they're trying to cross the street.
[01:49:31.906 --> 01:49:36.309]  So there was a photographer there who was watching him, seeing him like, wait a minute, what's this guy up to?
[01:49:36.309 --> 01:49:40.372]  The guy used to photograph horses, so he knew how to have that exact kind of reflexes.
[01:49:40.372 --> 01:49:42.973]  And the moment Schumann jumped the fence, he got the shot.
[01:49:42.973 --> 01:49:49.758]  The West Berlin people, cops, got him into a car, trafficked him to freedom, and it was just this beautiful, happy ending.
[01:49:49.758 --> 01:49:51.519]  But it's just this amazing moment.
[01:49:51.519 --> 01:49:53.441]  And that caused a chain reaction, so as...
[01:49:54.730 --> 01:50:00.755]  Russell Brand comes out against the New World Order, and as Elon Musk comes out against the New World Order, and as Joe Rogan comes out against the New World Order, and the Globalists.
[01:50:00.755 --> 01:50:03.277]  This is a microcosm of that.
[01:50:03.277 --> 01:50:04.779]  People jump on the fence.
[01:50:04.779 --> 01:50:16.508]  Right, but it's also the idea that there's so many of us who maybe are in positions to do the wrong thing, and just to remind you that you still as a human being have a conscience and the opportunity to do the right thing.
[01:50:16.508 --> 01:50:22.373]  There's another great story, Hans Meixner, M-E-I-X-N-E-R, and he fell in love with a girl from East Berlin.
[01:50:23.294 --> 01:50:28.181]  And he's like, all right, I'm going to marry this girl, but I got to get her the heck out of East Germany.
[01:50:28.181 --> 01:50:33.528]  So he goes to Checkpoint Charlie, which is the big crossing point between the two halves of the city.
[01:50:33.528 --> 01:50:38.634]  And he realizes that that bar, which they raise for a car to go through, is not that tall.
[01:50:39.255 --> 01:50:56.231]  So he gets a British car, puts her in the back seat, puts the future mother-in-law in the trunk, surrounds her with bricks in case they start shooting, takes off the windshield, takes some air out of the tires, and when they point him to go to the next spot, he just floors it like the Matrix.
[01:50:56.231 --> 01:51:01.796]  The car goes under that bar, and he escapes with her in the future mother-in-law to freedom in West Berlin and married her.
[01:51:01.796 --> 01:51:03.618]  So the answer to tyranny is stop complying.
[01:51:04.358 --> 01:51:15.361]  But the answer also is we all have the ability, in our own little personal ways, to fight and fight for our freedom, even in the most unfree situation.
[01:51:15.361 --> 01:51:28.164]  And I gotta tell you, as bad as things often are in America, and as bad as it would be if those who I oppose would have their druthers, we still have a lot of opportunity, all of us, to do something and move the needle in the right direction.
[01:51:28.164 --> 01:51:29.044]  So I haven't read the book yet.
[01:51:29.364 --> 01:51:33.188]  It's examples in Russia and East Germany and everywhere in Europe.
[01:51:33.188 --> 01:51:35.030]  But what about white pill moments here?
[01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:44.299]  I see Elon Musk three weeks ago at the World Government Forum put on by the World Economic Forum calling for total tyranny, implantable chips, total tracking, universal credit score.
[01:51:45.854 --> 01:51:48.715]  Anyone listening to this with a straight face look at John Fetterman
[01:52:02.342 --> 01:52:06.384]  And Kamala Harris and say, these are unstoppable foes.
[01:52:06.384 --> 01:52:09.065]  We can't win against people who are this impressive.
[01:52:09.065 --> 01:52:14.667]  It's a joke when you realize the thing is, it's not that they're particularly impressed or particularly smart.
[01:52:14.667 --> 01:52:20.009]  They've been at this for a lot longer and they've built up this edifice for a long time.
[01:52:20.009 --> 01:52:28.133]  But that is just because you're starting on third base does not at all guarantee you're going to have that home run, especially as a result of COVID.
[01:52:28.693 --> 01:52:43.687]  So many more people are aware of what we're up against, how low they'll be willing to go, and the point that, I think Republicans especially, they always talk about, like Reagan and Tip O'Neill, like, oh we're going to sit down together, everyone's going to shake hands at work.
[01:52:43.687 --> 01:52:46.129]  I think now people are realizing gun control is a good example.
[01:52:46.129 --> 01:52:48.071]  These people aren't arguing in good faith.
[01:52:48.071 --> 01:52:49.812]  They don't really want to have safety.
[01:52:49.812 --> 01:52:50.453]  They want to have control.
[01:52:50.453 --> 01:52:52.735]  Yeah, we're not compromising because we know it's not a compromise.
[01:52:53.095 --> 01:52:59.419]  There's nothing to compromise, because as soon as they get the AR-15s, infinitely, it's going to be, let's go after this gun or let's go after handguns.
[01:52:59.419 --> 01:53:05.263]  And I think everyone who is pro-gun rights has come to this realization in the last 10 years at least.
[01:53:05.263 --> 01:53:08.285]  So you know Elon Musk, you and Joe have gone out hands with him a lot.
[01:53:08.285 --> 01:53:09.806]  They're having a little event tomorrow, I'm told.
[01:53:09.806 --> 01:53:11.087]  But the point is, is that...
[01:53:12.034 --> 01:53:16.837]  Elon Musk, whether he's good or bad, he realizes the pendulum's going towards freedom, so he's jumped over to it.
[01:53:16.837 --> 01:53:18.958]  So we should see that as a good sign.
[01:53:18.958 --> 01:53:21.239]  I'll take whatever hope I can get.
[01:53:21.239 --> 01:53:24.621]  Because if you don't have hope, you cannot win.
[01:53:24.621 --> 01:53:28.483]  If you don't have a vision of what you're fighting for, you cannot possibly... And I said that earlier.
[01:53:28.483 --> 01:53:29.683]  We can't just oppose them.
[01:53:29.683 --> 01:53:30.484]  What do we stand for?
[01:53:30.484 --> 01:53:32.885]  So what do we stand for, or what do you stand for?
[01:53:34.366 --> 01:53:38.449]  What should we aspire to as the alternate system, A and B, what is it to be white pill?
[01:53:38.449 --> 01:53:43.713]  Because I agree, it's not like some, oh, you're naive, almost like a blue pill, you think everything's fine.
[01:53:43.713 --> 01:53:46.014]  No, no, you just have optimism and hope for humanity.
[01:53:46.014 --> 01:53:57.002]  Nor do I, and 75% of this book, nor am I of the belief that human beings are basically good and that those who are in power, oh, they only just want to kind of raise taxes and have regulation.
[01:53:57.002 --> 01:53:59.384]  The people who are in power are pure evil.
[01:53:59.944 --> 01:54:01.784]  Uh, there's, you can't put anything past them.
[01:54:01.784 --> 01:54:07.746]  The things that they do to children historically and in present times are things I would never sit down and think of in a million years.
[01:54:07.746 --> 01:54:10.726]  But the point being, they are not omnipotent and they're not unstoppable.
[01:54:10.726 --> 01:54:27.070]  Uh, and there's many, many examples, which you talk about all the time, where they just take L after L after L. The fact that people are now campaigning on imprisoning Fauci, uh, which would have been an unspeakable taboo a couple of years ago, in and of itself is, speaks to how much free speech, despite attempts to the
[01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:29.992]  500,000 person demonstrations in Germany.
[01:54:29.992 --> 01:54:31.053]  200,000 in Britain.
[01:54:31.053 --> 01:54:32.474]  Huge ones here.
[01:54:32.474 --> 01:54:34.496]  The media ignores it, but the people know it's happening.
[01:54:34.496 --> 01:54:38.599]  And the other thing is, like you were pointing out, URLs are infinite.
[01:54:38.599 --> 01:54:40.820]  You can make as many URLs as you want.
[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:42.922]  Back in the day, there were three channels.
[01:54:42.922 --> 01:54:45.024]  CBS, ABC, NBC.
[01:54:45.024 --> 01:54:48.446]  If those three channels agreed not to talk about you, you don't exist.
[01:54:48.446 --> 01:54:52.109]  Now you are demonstrating just today, there are infinite channels.
[01:54:52.389 --> 01:54:54.712]  Yeah, they're going to block one URL.
[01:54:54.712 --> 01:54:57.115]  Okay, here's $10, here's another URL.
[01:54:57.115 --> 01:54:58.576]  That's the best you can do?
[01:54:58.576 --> 01:55:04.703]  So just that progress in the last 30 years alone shows how difficult it is for the enemy class to control the conversation.
[01:55:04.703 --> 01:55:06.606]  And that's another reason why people should all be hopeful.
[01:55:07.171 --> 01:55:09.832]  If the people have energy, if they care, if they stand up.
[01:55:09.832 --> 01:55:16.913]  Guys, I'd ask you to print this up, you probably did put it on my desk, but print me the Oh How We Burn in the Camps quote by Solzhenitsyn.
[01:55:16.913 --> 01:55:18.414]  And what's the full Solzhenitsyn quote?
[01:55:18.414 --> 01:55:21.174]  I can't remember the exact quote, but we know, they know, they know, we know.
[01:55:21.174 --> 01:55:22.875]  Oh yeah.
[01:55:22.875 --> 01:55:27.656]  We know they're lying, they know they're lying, they know we know they're lying, but still they're lying.
[01:55:28.476 --> 01:55:41.102]  I think it's something to that effect, and I don't think that quote applies to America, because if you look at corporate journalists on Twitter, that's my preferred social media site, they are shocked by the pushback they get from average people.
[01:55:41.102 --> 01:55:55.810]  They really think that they're respected and liked, but nowadays, especially after COVID, when they'd be filming wearing a mask, but the cameraman doesn't have a mask, and anyone with a cell phone could just film and show that as soon as the camera goes off, they take the mask off, that these people are... They're so naive, right?
[01:55:55.810 --> 01:55:56.350]  It's actually...
[01:55:56.670 --> 01:55:58.593]  It makes me feel bad that they're dominating us.
[01:55:58.593 --> 01:56:00.195]  Like you said, these people are a joke.
[01:56:00.195 --> 01:56:05.984]  But again, they're dominating us because they had so many years in the past to kind of... So they're running off stuff at the bank.
[01:56:05.984 --> 01:56:06.765]  Don't you think?
[01:56:06.765 --> 01:56:07.265]  I agree.
[01:56:07.265 --> 01:56:07.946]  Here it is.
[01:56:07.946 --> 01:56:09.108]  The rulers are simple.
[01:56:09.108 --> 01:56:10.130]  They lie to us.
[01:56:10.130 --> 01:56:11.131]  We know they're lying.
[01:56:11.131 --> 01:56:11.532]  They know.
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:14.922]  They know we know they're lying.
[01:56:14.922 --> 01:56:18.465]  But they keep lying to us and keep pretending to believe them.
[01:56:18.465 --> 01:56:20.588]  And we keep pretending to believe them, yeah.
[01:56:20.588 --> 01:56:22.289]  Yeah, the rulers are simple.
[01:56:22.289 --> 01:56:30.618]  They lie to us, we know they're lying, they know, we know they're lying, but they keep lying to us and we keep pretending to believe them.
[01:56:30.618 --> 01:56:33.140]  But that's the thing, in the Soviet Union you had to pretend to believe them, right?
[01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:36.344]  Because if I'm in the Soviet Union, and I discuss this heavily in the book,
[01:56:36.904 --> 01:56:42.346]  I can't say that the newspaper prompter is full of crap, because that's going to be trouble for me and my family.
[01:56:42.346 --> 01:56:49.287]  No one has repercussions for going on Facebook or talking to their friends and family and being like, the New York Times is full of crap.
[01:56:49.287 --> 01:56:52.028]  The Washington Post is just propaganda.
[01:56:52.028 --> 01:56:52.408]  Exactly.
[01:56:52.408 --> 01:56:54.169]  So we're far from where other people have been.
[01:56:54.169 --> 01:56:56.049]  We better fight now or we're going to go there.
[01:56:56.049 --> 01:56:56.589]  I agree with you.
[01:56:56.589 --> 01:56:56.789]  Right.
[01:56:56.789 --> 01:56:57.510]  Exactly.
[01:56:57.510 --> 01:57:02.291]  And again, stop getting intimidated by completely unimpressive people.
[01:57:04.417 --> 01:57:05.237]  Like Fetterman?
[01:57:05.237 --> 01:57:06.097]  Like Fetterman!
[01:57:06.097 --> 01:57:11.679]  Well, I actually sent him money because I want the Senate to look as much like Arkham Asylum as possible.
[01:57:11.679 --> 01:57:14.960]  And my hope is that one day he's going to be on the Senate floor and his head just explodes.
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:18.320]  Well, we'll come back and talk about that in the second hour about to begin.
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:21.841]  Why are we seeing Bidens and Fettermans and others that can't even talk?
[01:57:21.841 --> 01:57:26.502]  Is that on purpose or is it a manifestation of the crumbling, rotting edifice of the establishment?
[01:57:26.502 --> 01:57:27.563]  We'll be right back in the second hour.
[01:57:27.563 --> 01:57:30.363]  Michael Malice, the new book, The White Pill.
[01:57:30.363 --> 01:57:31.084]  Get it today.
[01:57:31.084 --> 01:57:31.984]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:31.984 --> 01:57:32.424]  Stay with us.
[01:57:32.964 --> 01:57:37.849]  Infowars.com and the new URL, MadMaxWorld.tv.
[01:57:37.849 --> 01:57:43.534]  That's the new URL, the destination of freedom, MadMaxTV, MadMaxWorld.tv.
[01:57:49.181 --> 01:58:01.144]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to mfulworthstore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[01:58:01.144 --> 01:58:09.506]  I am humbly, hand-in-hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of you for years, and never gone to mfulworthstore.com.
[01:58:09.506 --> 01:58:17.988]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to mfulworthstore.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[01:58:18.288 --> 01:58:21.349]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[01:58:21.349 --> 01:58:22.710]  That's great, and I thank you.
[01:58:22.710 --> 01:58:24.231]  But we need funds to operate.
[01:58:24.231 --> 01:58:32.595]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our Fizzy Magnesium, and our Sleep Aid, and our Nitric Oxide, and our Real Red Pill.
[01:58:32.595 --> 01:58:35.556]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[01:58:35.556 --> 01:58:37.337]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[01:58:37.337 --> 01:58:38.637]  So get off the bench.
[01:58:38.637 --> 01:58:39.498]  Get in the game.
[01:58:39.498 --> 01:58:46.221]  Step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:48.447 --> 01:58:56.916]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars has proven itself in the last 28 years to be over the globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants.
[01:58:56.916 --> 01:59:02.361]  And we fund our operation with viewers and listeners' support while selling you great products at the same time.
[01:59:02.361 --> 01:59:06.725]  So I want to thank all the viewers and listeners who have supported us over the years by spreading the word.
[01:59:07.426 --> 01:59:07.826]  We're good to go.
[01:59:31.192 --> 01:59:34.513]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:04.472 --> 02:00:10.458]  Alright, Michael Malice, best-selling author, hit podcaster, is our guest in studio on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:10.458 --> 02:00:14.782]  Next segment, he wants to talk about Donald Trump and some of his statements the last few weeks.
[02:00:14.782 --> 02:00:20.006]  But right now, a lot of people call into the show, or I see them comment on InfoWars, Jones is a coward.
[02:00:20.006 --> 02:00:21.628]  He doesn't want to lead a violent revolution.
[02:00:22.128 --> 02:00:27.690]  Well, the average cop or Justice Department person or whoever, they're like part of the system, but they're not running it.
[02:00:27.690 --> 02:00:31.311]  How does killing them do something that would bring in martial law?
[02:00:31.311 --> 02:00:33.892]  I want to win a velvet revolution of ideas.
[02:00:33.892 --> 02:00:36.793]  That's where 90% of real war happens, which is the info war.
[02:00:36.793 --> 02:00:38.173]  Michael Malice, where's your view on that?
[02:00:38.173 --> 02:00:41.594]  I agree through 10,000%, which defies mathematics.
[02:00:41.594 --> 02:00:50.997]  If you have violence in the street, if we saw this with the BLM riots, that is the easiest and most effective method for people who don't care about politics to be like, I just need this to end.
[02:00:51.457 --> 02:00:55.359]  And to validate martial law, to validate restrictions on freedom.
[02:00:55.359 --> 02:01:01.061]  If you think the Patriot Act is a problem now, imagine what happens if there's some kind of a failed violent revolution.
[02:01:01.061 --> 02:01:02.142]  And they've been trying to get that.
[02:01:02.142 --> 02:01:07.384]  Just off January 6th and opening the gates up, they're trying to brand all dissenters as terrorists right now.
[02:01:07.384 --> 02:01:09.305]  Look what they did to the Freedom Convoy in Canada.
[02:01:09.305 --> 02:01:15.768]  These are truckers who were just honking their horns and they pulled them away to God knows where, invoked emergency powers.
[02:01:15.768 --> 02:01:20.150]  Listen, if the government can invoke emergency powers, it's going to create emergencies to invoke them.
[02:01:20.610 --> 02:01:23.292]  And we know they hire provocateurs to do it, so let's not do it.
[02:01:23.292 --> 02:01:27.876]  Yeah, I think the call to violence is really... And the other thing is violence sings its own song.
[02:01:27.876 --> 02:01:30.718]  So once that kind of genie's out the bottle, you don't know where it's going to end up.
[02:01:30.718 --> 02:01:32.379]  I think that's a very dangerous idea.
[02:01:32.379 --> 02:01:38.364]  I think as long as there's free speech in this country, which despite the mechanisms, you could still get your voice out there.
[02:01:38.364 --> 02:01:40.325]  Well, look at Russia and Ukraine.
[02:01:40.325 --> 02:01:42.687]  The globalists just sit back and roast hot dogs on the fire.
[02:01:43.027 --> 02:01:44.390]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:47.656]  And the people who are the dangerous ones aren't the ones who are going to be in the line of fire.
[02:01:47.656 --> 02:01:48.558]  They never are.
[02:01:48.558 --> 02:01:52.786]  So I think this is just absolutely a crazy thing to kind of normalize and discuss.
[02:01:53.484 --> 02:01:59.668]  That's why when I see news saying that I'm calling for violence, when I say info war, tip of the spear, break their back, I mean intellectually.
[02:01:59.668 --> 02:02:00.589]  Everybody knows that.
[02:02:00.589 --> 02:02:03.210]  Because the Pentagon admits 90% of war is intellectual.
[02:02:03.210 --> 02:02:06.833]  Of course, and that's another reason why hope is so important.
[02:02:06.833 --> 02:02:12.376]  If you convince the population that you're always going to be under the thumb of Washington, why would you bother fighting?
[02:02:12.376 --> 02:02:17.479]  You're going to save your time and spend time with your kids, because, well, I can't win, so I might as well let them have what I want.
[02:02:17.479 --> 02:02:22.903]  So that is by far the most effective way to defeat your opponent, is to convince them that your victory is inevitable.
[02:02:23.203 --> 02:02:25.145]  I don't even like speculating about that.
[02:02:25.145 --> 02:02:26.185]  God help us if we get to that point.
[02:02:46.766 --> 02:02:48.326]  God help them if we do.
[02:02:48.326 --> 02:02:57.688]  Yeah, yeah, but I mean, I think the more kind of this talk that's out there in the zeitgeist, the easier it is for them to kind of... No, I agree, they'll totally take it out of context.
[02:02:57.688 --> 02:02:59.729]  And they're also going to fight for restrictions for gun rights.
[02:02:59.729 --> 02:03:07.290]  Because then it's going to be like, look, people are talking about, you know, vile revolution, even though the country was shot in a vile revolution, we can't let them have their guns.
[02:03:07.290 --> 02:03:10.311]  And Mitch McConnell... Well, I would follow our 1776 model.
[02:03:10.311 --> 02:03:13.912]  We tried for a decade to fix it, they came to confiscate the guns, they shot first.
[02:03:14.452 --> 02:03:19.556]  We're not looking for that, folks, because in a modern world, back then, info war was 20 percent.
[02:03:19.556 --> 02:03:21.517]  According to the Pentagon, I agree with them.
[02:03:21.517 --> 02:03:22.938]  Now it's 90 percent.
[02:03:22.938 --> 02:03:26.081]  So informate, the pen is mightier than the sword, more than ever.
[02:03:26.081 --> 02:03:29.083]  Use the damn pen before you talk about a war.
[02:03:29.083 --> 02:03:30.084]  And here's something else.
[02:03:30.084 --> 02:03:41.572]  I think people need to appreciate that Americans got, I mean, you're going to not like hearing this, aren't as pro-freedom as you'd like to think, because the pushback against COVID was very, very weak, given what you would think Americans would put up with.
[02:03:41.972 --> 02:03:46.696]  And it's given some very evil people some very useful information about the limits of American compliance.
[02:03:46.696 --> 02:03:47.897]  No, I agree.
[02:03:47.897 --> 02:03:48.978]  COVID was a test.
[02:03:48.978 --> 02:03:49.898]  It was a test.
[02:03:49.898 --> 02:03:53.941]  By design or not, they learned what they can get away with and what they can't.
[02:03:53.941 --> 02:04:00.546]  And what they learned is a lot of people were more than happy to be imprisoned in their own homes under threat of a virus.
[02:04:00.546 --> 02:04:02.328]  What do you think they're going to hit us with next?
[02:04:03.494 --> 02:04:08.555]  I think things are going to start falling apart really quickly.
[02:04:08.555 --> 02:04:16.918]  Here's the thing, the midterms didn't go the way that the Democrats would want, but they're not really taking their victory lap, and I think that's kind of intriguing to me.
[02:04:16.918 --> 02:04:21.799]  You would think they'd be like, look, we defeated the evil Republicans, we're a threat to our democracy, this is all great.
[02:04:22.119 --> 02:04:27.643]  But they're kind of quiet because I think they've got their guy Kevin McCarthy in there and he's going to be able to make deals with Biden.
[02:04:27.643 --> 02:04:34.908]  I don't trust him as far as I can throw him, let alone McConnell, you know, who certainly cares far more about Joe Biden's views than he does about the average American citizen.
[02:04:34.908 --> 02:04:42.633]  So I don't know where things are going to go, but I'm very hopeful about the future because I think more Americans are realizing you can't, you're not going to be saved by whoever's in the White House.
[02:04:42.633 --> 02:04:45.234]  As long as they can't trick us into race war violence.
[02:04:45.234 --> 02:04:45.435]  Right.
[02:04:46.295 --> 02:04:50.620]  And knowing that Washington is not going to save you, I think that is a big epiphany.
[02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:52.202]  I've got an example of that when we come back.
[02:04:52.202 --> 02:04:52.783]  Stay right there.
[02:04:59.525 --> 02:05:07.731]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globals, in their own words, plan for our future.
[02:05:07.731 --> 02:05:09.192]  That is a hellish future.
[02:05:09.192 --> 02:05:18.119]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarshore.com.
[02:05:18.579 --> 02:05:24.182]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[02:05:24.182 --> 02:05:26.763]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:05:26.763 --> 02:05:32.146]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHorror.com.
[02:05:32.146 --> 02:05:36.088]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:05:36.088 --> 02:05:41.972]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you helped keep InfoWars on the air.
[02:05:41.972 --> 02:05:44.053]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[02:05:44.833 --> 02:05:45.893]  Or unsigned copies.
[02:05:45.893 --> 02:05:56.237]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[02:05:56.237 --> 02:05:57.297]  This is an Infowar.
[02:05:57.297 --> 02:06:01.158]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[02:06:01.158 --> 02:06:03.979]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[02:06:03.979 --> 02:06:04.559]  Let me think.
[02:06:04.559 --> 02:06:05.119]  Just let me think.
[02:06:05.119 --> 02:06:10.721]  I suspect even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns are supposed to be on their way.
[02:06:10.721 --> 02:06:12.082]  It's Chancellor Settler.
[02:06:12.082 --> 02:06:12.742]  Damn it!
[02:06:12.742 --> 02:06:12.862]  Why?
[02:06:13.815 --> 02:06:20.401]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[02:06:20.401 --> 02:06:26.506]  Words are for the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
[02:06:26.506 --> 02:06:29.509]  But the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with
[02:06:30.049 --> 02:06:31.189]  This country isn't that way.
[02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:32.210]  You designed it, sir.
[02:06:32.210 --> 02:06:33.150]  You wanted it foolproof.
[02:06:33.150 --> 02:06:34.811]  You taught me every television in London.
[02:06:34.811 --> 02:06:36.892]  Cruelty and injustice.
[02:06:36.892 --> 02:06:38.712]  Intolerance and oppression.
[02:06:38.712 --> 02:06:48.216]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and subverting your submission.
[02:06:48.216 --> 02:06:48.556]  Cameras.
[02:06:48.556 --> 02:06:49.557]  We need cameras.
[02:06:49.557 --> 02:06:50.777]  How did this happen?
[02:06:50.777 --> 02:06:51.778]  Who's to blame?
[02:06:52.739 --> 02:06:55.424]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[02:06:55.424 --> 02:06:57.768]  They will be held accountable.
[02:06:57.768 --> 02:07:03.199]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[02:07:04.415 --> 02:07:06.036]  I know why you did it.
[02:07:06.036 --> 02:07:07.898]  I know you were afraid.
[02:07:07.898 --> 02:07:09.139]  Who wouldn't be?
[02:07:09.139 --> 02:07:09.879]  War?
[02:07:09.879 --> 02:07:10.520]  Terror?
[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:11.821]  Disease?
[02:07:11.821 --> 02:07:18.266]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[02:07:18.266 --> 02:07:24.271]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[02:07:24.271 --> 02:07:30.876]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[02:07:37.602 --> 02:07:39.223]  There is a war.
[02:07:39.223 --> 02:07:41.085]  It's happening now.
[02:07:41.085 --> 02:07:43.466]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:07:43.466 --> 02:07:45.908]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:07:45.908 --> 02:07:47.950]  We are the resistance.
[02:07:47.950 --> 02:07:50.331]  We are the Infowar.
[02:07:50.331 --> 02:07:58.197]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:08:11.161 --> 02:08:15.524]  Info Wars has been banned.
[02:08:15.524 --> 02:08:19.446]  Arrested.
[02:08:19.446 --> 02:08:22.228]  Attacked and threatened.
[02:08:22.228 --> 02:08:25.530]  Because we are effective.
[02:08:25.530 --> 02:08:27.291]  The Great Awakening is here.
[02:08:27.291 --> 02:08:29.652]  Go to Banned.Video.
[02:08:29.652 --> 02:08:33.754]  Download the videos and share.
[02:08:33.754 --> 02:08:37.437]  Support the Information War at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:08:41.076 --> 02:08:43.238]  And never give up the fight.
[02:08:43.238 --> 02:08:51.943]  All right, Michael Malice in studio.
[02:08:51.943 --> 02:08:55.485]  Paul Watson popping in on the big breaking COVID news.
[02:08:55.485 --> 02:08:57.087]  Michael, you want to talk about Trump.
[02:08:58.092 --> 02:08:59.654]  And man, I get dumbfounded.
[02:08:59.654 --> 02:09:01.535]  I like Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:09:01.535 --> 02:09:03.177]  Talking about running for president against Biden.
[02:09:03.177 --> 02:09:04.998]  I'd get behind him.
[02:09:04.998 --> 02:09:06.299]  DeSantis does a lot of good stuff.
[02:09:06.299 --> 02:09:08.741]  I like DeSantis, but he's a little too pro-war for me.
[02:09:08.741 --> 02:09:12.305]  There's some anti-free speech stuff coming out of Florida right now I'm really concerned about.
[02:09:12.305 --> 02:09:13.105]  I don't know if you're aware of that.
[02:09:13.105 --> 02:09:14.847]  It's out of control.
[02:09:14.847 --> 02:09:15.327]  But Trump...
[02:09:17.385 --> 02:09:21.528]  It's true.
[02:09:21.528 --> 02:09:25.451]  He made a very bizarre statement.
[02:09:25.451 --> 02:09:30.055]  So he gave a speech over the weekend saying you're going to get retribution.
[02:09:30.055 --> 02:09:31.656]  We're going to bring down the deep state.
[02:09:31.656 --> 02:09:34.538]  But then in another interview, he said he's not going to be out headhunting.
[02:09:34.798 --> 02:09:45.103]  Yeah, there was a clip when he was with Hugh Hewitt, and for me, I think the biggest reason people would want to support Trump, from what I've heard from people in the audience, that it's like, all right, he's going to get payback, right?
[02:09:45.103 --> 02:09:46.283]  He got wronged.
[02:09:46.283 --> 02:09:47.484]  Trump is a vindictive guy.
[02:09:47.484 --> 02:09:47.944]  He's petty.
[02:09:47.944 --> 02:09:49.665]  That's the argument people always say.
[02:09:49.665 --> 02:09:51.085]  He's going to take it down to deep state.
[02:09:51.085 --> 02:09:53.967]  But when he was on Hugh Hewitt, he was asked about this explicitly.
[02:09:53.967 --> 02:09:56.888]  Do we have the clip or do we have a transcript of it?
[02:09:56.888 --> 02:09:57.668]  We have the clip.
[02:09:57.668 --> 02:09:59.129]  You guys were able to find it on a 20 minute clip?
[02:10:00.575 --> 02:10:07.863]  Well, they got it exactly wrong.
[02:10:07.863 --> 02:10:16.854]  Well, they did get it wrong, but my question is, if you're back in the Oval, will you use the powers of the presidency to punish people who punished you?
[02:10:17.899 --> 02:10:22.042]  No, I wouldn't do that because I want to bring our country forward.
[02:10:22.042 --> 02:10:23.402]  No, I wouldn't do that.
[02:10:23.402 --> 02:10:26.544]  What are the best things you did when you ran the first time?
[02:10:26.544 --> 02:10:27.325]  I wouldn't.
[02:10:27.325 --> 02:10:31.727]  I would be entitled to a revenge tour if you want to know the truth, but I wouldn't do that.
[02:10:31.727 --> 02:10:34.549]  I would want to straighten out our border.
[02:10:34.549 --> 02:10:40.633]  I would want to get inflation down, build our economy up, which is actually doing very poorly.
[02:10:40.633 --> 02:10:43.534]  You do have a potential disaster in your hands with the war.
[02:10:43.534 --> 02:10:46.296]  You also have a disaster with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
[02:10:46.917 --> 02:10:48.218]  I get along with him great.
[02:10:48.218 --> 02:10:49.198]  He always liked me.
[02:10:49.198 --> 02:10:49.939]  You saw that.
[02:10:49.939 --> 02:10:51.720]  And he doesn't like Biden at all.
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:53.601]  And he's arming up.
[02:10:53.601 --> 02:10:55.122]  And Iran is arming up.
[02:10:55.122 --> 02:10:56.943]  And you've got to do something about it.
[02:10:56.943 --> 02:11:02.306]  One of the people who is going to declare for president this month, according to reports this morning, is Nikki Haley.
[02:11:02.306 --> 02:11:04.207]  If she runs for president, what's your response?
[02:11:04.207 --> 02:11:04.928]  Yeah, how about that idiot?
[02:11:04.928 --> 02:11:08.050]  Okay, so there's Trump saying he's not going to go after people.
[02:11:08.050 --> 02:11:10.291]  That was back on February 2nd.
[02:11:10.291 --> 02:11:14.213]  We have a new clip from Friday at one of his rallies saying the opposite.
[02:11:14.213 --> 02:11:14.854]  Here's that clip.
[02:11:15.902 --> 02:11:20.243]  And if you put me back in the White House, their reign is over.
[02:11:20.243 --> 02:11:22.163]  Their reign will be over.
[02:11:22.163 --> 02:11:22.943]  And they know it.
[02:11:22.943 --> 02:11:25.464]  And America will be a free nation once again.
[02:11:25.464 --> 02:11:27.304]  We're not a free nation right now.
[02:11:27.304 --> 02:11:28.444]  We don't have free press.
[02:11:28.444 --> 02:11:30.805]  We don't have free anything.
[02:11:30.805 --> 02:11:35.226]  In 2016, I declared, I am your voice.
[02:11:35.226 --> 02:11:38.226]  Today, I add, I am your warrior.
[02:11:38.226 --> 02:11:39.866]  I am your justice.
[02:11:39.866 --> 02:11:42.727]  And for those who have been wronged and betrayed,
[02:11:43.744 --> 02:11:45.205]  I am your retribution.
[02:11:45.205 --> 02:11:46.966]  I am your retribution.
[02:11:46.966 --> 02:11:49.567]  Not gonna let this happen.
[02:11:49.567 --> 02:11:51.328]  Maybe he's saying this now he knows they're gonna indict him.
[02:11:51.328 --> 02:11:57.010]  Not gonna let it happen.
[02:11:57.010 --> 02:12:00.472]  I will totally obliterate the Deep State.
[02:12:00.472 --> 02:12:06.675]  I will fire... So he needs to clarify this.
[02:12:06.675 --> 02:12:10.217]  He just said he won't grab the Deep State in February and then now
[02:12:11.561 --> 02:12:12.662]  Fauci says he will.
[02:12:12.662 --> 02:12:14.044]  Michael Malice, good point you raised.
[02:12:14.044 --> 02:12:22.796]  Trump treated Anthony Fauci far better than he treated Steve Bannon or any of the January 6th protesters who got locked up in solitary for God knows how long.
[02:12:22.796 --> 02:12:27.863]  And for him to go on with a straight face and say I'm not going to have retribution for people who have wronged me,
[02:12:28.163 --> 02:12:30.184]  This reminds me very much of 2001.
[02:12:30.184 --> 02:12:31.704]  Alex, I'm sure you remember this.
[02:12:31.704 --> 02:12:37.246]  You probably covered at the time when they were going to go after Bill Clinton for perjury after he left the White House.
[02:12:37.246 --> 02:12:44.228]  And the first thing George W. Bush did as president was to put a kibosh on any kind of criminal prosecution of the former president.
[02:12:44.808 --> 02:12:49.010]  And the First Lady, because he thought this was going to divide the country and make us look bad.
[02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:52.732]  And it really sounds like Trump is saying the same thing out of his own words.
[02:12:52.732 --> 02:12:54.053]  This isn't TDS talking.
[02:12:54.053 --> 02:12:58.515]  This is explicitly saying, I'm not going to have retribution.
[02:12:58.515 --> 02:13:04.358]  It saddens me to hear him say this, because if he's saying this now, it certainly sounds like he would do it as well.
[02:13:05.017 --> 02:13:06.558]  Well, it's very paradoxical.
[02:13:06.558 --> 02:13:09.681]  He's telling a radio show, I'm not going to do it.
[02:13:09.681 --> 02:13:13.083]  And then he goes on a month later and says, I am.
[02:13:13.083 --> 02:13:20.469]  I can't think of any examples of him going after his political opponents, as opposed to people who work for him trying to do a good job.
[02:13:20.469 --> 02:13:22.331]  No, instead, Jared Kuster gives them blowjobs.
[02:13:25.818 --> 02:13:32.122]  I mean, can anyone think of a good example of Trump taking down one of his political opponents and causing consequences?
[02:13:32.122 --> 02:13:44.691]  The best example I could think of, which was actually very funny, was when Nancy Pelosi and all the Democrats were trying to use a military plane to go overseas to visit a military base, and he pulled their permission slip, and they had to drive the bus around, and then they had to go back home.
[02:13:44.691 --> 02:13:51.276]  So that was humorous, but in terms of, you know, crushing his opponents... No, he was all on a big talk, but he didn't exercise power against Steve Stein at any level.
[02:13:51.917 --> 02:13:52.397]  Right.
[02:13:52.397 --> 02:13:57.925]  He was very good at taking on Jeb Bush, John Kasich in the primaries and making sure they didn't get the nomination.
[02:13:57.925 --> 02:13:58.826]  Credit to him.
[02:13:58.826 --> 02:14:04.914]  But in terms of using the powers of the White House to kind of disarm his opponents, I don't see it.
[02:14:04.914 --> 02:14:06.276]  And I would love to be proven wrong.
[02:14:07.137 --> 02:14:09.158]  So who do you like for the presidency?
[02:14:09.158 --> 02:14:13.401]  I don't think the presidency is going to be a very effective vector.
[02:14:13.401 --> 02:14:13.822]  Exactly.
[02:14:13.822 --> 02:14:17.624]  We don't need the EPA to tell us to boil our water or filter it.
[02:14:17.624 --> 02:14:18.805]  We should just do it ourselves.
[02:14:18.805 --> 02:14:19.145]  Right.
[02:14:19.145 --> 02:14:31.313]  And you have to, I think if people are expecting the person in the White House to be the mechanism by which this country is saved, I think that is a hopeless position because the system itself is too stacked against them.
[02:14:31.313 --> 02:14:34.095]  Even if you had 50 Reagans or whoever the person might like.
[02:14:34.095 --> 02:14:36.377]  Why do you think Trump won't come out against the shot?
[02:14:37.197 --> 02:14:39.298]  That's his biggest downfall with his supporters.
[02:14:59.346 --> 02:15:04.012]  And the other thing is, he is being held to standards that his opponents aren't.
[02:15:04.012 --> 02:15:07.516]  Kamala Harris explicitly said she's not trusting the Trump vaccine.
[02:15:07.516 --> 02:15:12.323]  And five minutes later, once she's VP, if you don't take the shot, you shouldn't be allowed to enter the country.
[02:15:12.323 --> 02:15:13.684]  She said, I'll never take a shot from Trump.
[02:15:13.684 --> 02:15:15.226]  Now you better take it or you can go to jail.
[02:15:15.226 --> 02:15:16.788]  Yeah, and your kids better take it too.
[02:15:18.030 --> 02:15:19.070]  It's ridiculous, yeah.
[02:15:19.070 --> 02:15:23.895]  Let's come back and I want to ask you, what would you advise Trump to do to save the country?
[02:15:23.895 --> 02:15:26.717]  We have Paul Watson popping in on this huge story.
[02:15:26.717 --> 02:15:36.907]  I'm sure you've seen this, Michael, but the head UK Minister of Health in these text messages, they confirm are real, saying, do we release the new variant to scare the pants off people?
[02:15:36.907 --> 02:15:37.768]  This is big.
[02:15:37.768 --> 02:15:38.688]  Yes, very.
[02:15:39.429 --> 02:15:40.731]  All right, Michael Malice.
[02:15:40.731 --> 02:15:43.975]  The White Pill is the new book, available everywhere.
[02:15:43.975 --> 02:15:50.004]  We'll be right back with Michael Malice and Paul Joseph Watson of Summit News.
[02:15:50.004 --> 02:15:50.485]  Stay with us.
[02:15:58.151 --> 02:16:00.112]  I've got some good news.
[02:16:00.112 --> 02:16:06.994]  Our high-quality supplements really work, and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[02:16:06.994 --> 02:16:07.815]  That's the good news.
[02:16:07.815 --> 02:16:08.955]  They're amazing.
[02:16:08.955 --> 02:16:17.138]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to Infowarshaw.com and ever actually buy the products.
[02:16:17.138 --> 02:16:20.580]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the Infowar.
[02:16:20.580 --> 02:16:25.501]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[02:16:25.501 --> 02:16:26.342]  Think what would happen.
[02:16:27.262 --> 02:16:40.791]  If those of you on the fence actually went to InfoWarStore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects, so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[02:16:40.791 --> 02:16:49.757]  Also, we've got the super high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones, as well.
[02:16:49.757 --> 02:16:51.138]  Or Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:16:51.138 --> 02:16:55.561]  Just go try the product, fund the InfoWar, and help us defeat the new order together.
[02:16:55.561 --> 02:16:56.882]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:16:57.022 --> 02:16:57.943]  I don't know.
[02:17:14.483 --> 02:17:17.284]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[02:17:17.284 --> 02:17:19.005]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[02:17:19.005 --> 02:17:21.506]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[02:17:21.506 --> 02:17:25.867]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[02:17:25.867 --> 02:17:31.669]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:36.571]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[02:17:36.571 --> 02:17:39.712]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the
[02:17:40.873 --> 02:17:53.239]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people and I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[02:18:00.006 --> 02:18:04.630]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023.
[02:18:04.630 --> 02:18:06.411]  And the world is an insane place.
[02:18:06.411 --> 02:18:08.152]  World War III has already started.
[02:18:08.152 --> 02:18:10.474]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[02:18:10.474 --> 02:18:11.635]  There's mass censorship.
[02:18:11.635 --> 02:18:13.837]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[02:18:13.837 --> 02:18:16.098]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[02:18:16.098 --> 02:18:20.482]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[02:18:20.742 --> 02:18:24.683]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[02:18:24.683 --> 02:18:33.106]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at Infowarshore.com.

[02:19:29.838 --> 02:19:31.559]  Cardiovascular, critical.

[02:19:39.624 --> 02:19:48.589]  And the final 1,200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, and I'm not gonna sign anymore after that, are exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com as well.
[02:19:48.749 --> 02:19:51.170]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[02:19:51.170 --> 02:19:52.051]  We didn't have them for sale.
[02:19:52.051 --> 02:19:53.592]  But now, I signed the last books.
[02:19:53.592 --> 02:19:58.875]  You can get them right now.
[02:19:58.875 --> 02:20:04.779]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:23.058 --> 02:20:25.440]  Well, I want to say congratulations to Michael Malice.
[02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:26.280]  I've read his other books.
[02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:30.263]  Can't wait to read The White Pill, A Tale of Good and Evil.
[02:20:30.263 --> 02:20:44.774]  Joining us now is Paul Joseph Watson, and I appreciate him coming on with it, as busy as he is, at Summit.News with the incredible 100,000 plus WhatsApp texts of the head health minister
[02:20:47.173 --> 02:20:51.036]  Matt Hancock talking about releasing a new variant.
[02:20:51.036 --> 02:21:06.246]  I don't think he released the variant, literally, but releasing the fear and the scare the pants off people and how they talk about how to scare the public to make them submit to lockdowns following this whole script written by Fauci and Bill Gates in the UN, the WEF.
[02:21:06.246 --> 02:21:07.647]  Paul, this is so huge.
[02:21:07.647 --> 02:21:08.748]  It broke Friday.
[02:21:08.748 --> 02:21:11.430]  The Telegraph, it's everywhere, thank God.
[02:21:11.430 --> 02:21:14.011]  But this is just crazy level stuff.
[02:21:14.011 --> 02:21:16.293]  You're there in the UK, your view on that situation?
[02:21:17.659 --> 02:21:22.805]  Well, yeah, it broke Friday, Alex, but this is part of a long-running feature by The Telegraph.
[02:21:22.805 --> 02:21:28.110]  Basically, one of the journalists there got hold of Matt Hancock's text messages.
[02:21:28.110 --> 02:21:34.377]  And by the way, this is a guy who, before the pandemic even really set in, in January 2020, told his friend
[02:21:37.228 --> 02:21:48.651]  That this pandemic, given that he was basically the public face of the response to it in the United Kingdom, would propel him into the next league, would basically turn him into a celebrity superstar.
[02:21:49.461 --> 02:21:58.209]  After the pandemic supposedly ended, or at least the restrictions were lifted, he's now become this reality TV star in the United Kingdom.
[02:21:58.209 --> 02:22:10.098]  He's basically trying to use this as a trampoline to send himself into the stratosphere as being, you know, the strong man, the guy that responded to COVID that saved the country.
[02:22:10.098 --> 02:22:15.663]  These messages have come out, and we kind of already knew part of this, Alex, and we in fact had the stories back in 2021.
[02:22:17.210 --> 02:22:31.358]  Where the government advisor groups openly came out and said that they engaged in quote unethical and totalitarian behavior right before the first lockdown, the key function that they sought to fulfill
[02:22:32.242 --> 02:22:41.449]  ...was to scare the public by grossly exaggerating the threat of Covid, even as far back as February-March 2020.
[02:22:41.449 --> 02:22:49.435]  So they knew right from the beginning that it wasn't as bad as we were told it was, as all the lurid propaganda told us that it was.
[02:22:49.435 --> 02:22:56.401]  And this is now being confirmed with these 100,000 leaked WhatsApp messages because, as I just said in the intro there,
[02:22:57.208 --> 02:22:58.929]  He openly talks.
[02:22:58.929 --> 02:23:05.592]  And this, by the way, is right before the December 2020 lockdown, which was the second full lockdown of the country.
[02:23:05.592 --> 02:23:07.893]  They're struggling a bit politically.
[02:23:07.893 --> 02:23:11.094]  People are starting to ask questions about the rollout of the vaccine.
[02:23:11.094 --> 02:23:17.297]  They're starting to ask questions about the draconian clampdown on civil liberties with the lockdown.
[02:23:17.297 --> 02:23:21.299]  They're starting to ask questions about other political issues that they want to distract from.
[02:23:22.006 --> 02:23:36.537]  So there you have Matt Hancock, the UK Health Secretary, saying that they need to deploy a new COVID variant to, quote, brighten the pants off the general public and make sure they comply with lockdown.
[02:23:36.537 --> 02:23:41.501]  Now, of course, as you said, Matt Hancock's not there in the Wuhan lab cooking it up.
[02:23:41.501 --> 02:23:48.626]  They already knew the variant was coming and they deliberately politically chose the moment that they'd reveal it to the public.
[02:23:49.321 --> 02:24:07.137]  Despite, as some of the other text messages show, they were getting advice at the same time from some scientists, some researchers, including the Imperial College of London, showing them that the infections were actually decreasing, that this was becoming less of a problem.
[02:24:07.137 --> 02:24:13.443]  They deliberately chose to ignore that as part of what the media in this country is calling Project Fear.
[02:24:14.071 --> 02:24:35.448]  to fear and guilt the general public into obeying lockdown by only concentrating on these more severe alarmist paranoid modeling which of course as we now know later turned out to be completely inaccurate so every step of the way these leaked text messages show they knew it wasn't as bad as they were telling the public it was
[02:24:35.908 --> 02:24:40.939]  They deliberately engaged in totalitarian methods of mind control.
[02:24:40.939 --> 02:24:44.928]  They ignored the modeling which contradicted their public messaging.
[02:24:45.811 --> 02:24:54.013]  And basically they wanted to scare the public, to frighten the pants off the public, into complete obedience, and to shut down all dissent.
[02:24:54.013 --> 02:24:57.954]  And that's basically the nub of what these text messages tell us.
[02:24:57.954 --> 02:25:00.154]  And now the big question... We were right, once again.
[02:25:00.154 --> 02:25:01.155]  Exactly, we were right once again.
[02:25:01.155 --> 02:25:04.476]  So the big question, I'll ask you this then Michael Malice, what needs to come next?
[02:25:04.476 --> 02:25:05.936]  I mean, he needs to get in trouble.
[02:25:06.696 --> 02:25:15.541]  And I'm not blaming the UK, I'm not an Anglophile, I'm not an Anglophobe, but clearly it was always the UK that kept announcing the new variants.
[02:25:15.541 --> 02:25:20.584]  It looks like whoever was advising him was quarterbacking the larger global fear.
[02:25:20.584 --> 02:25:26.927]  So to me it's not what he did, it's asking him in depositions or lawsuits, who told you to do this?
[02:25:26.927 --> 02:25:28.548]  Who told you about the new variant?
[02:25:28.548 --> 02:25:33.571]  For me this is a very important point, like he's a capo, who is the Don above him?
[02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:40.921]  Well, I think one of the prime individuals in that context will be Professor Neil Ferguson.
[02:25:40.921 --> 02:25:48.503]  This is the guy who provided the base modelling that convinced the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to lock down the country.
[02:25:48.503 --> 02:25:50.443]  Now, of course, I've made the point before.
[02:25:50.443 --> 02:25:55.544]  He personally took the lockdown, the first lockdown, when, you know, it was deadly serious.
[02:25:55.544 --> 02:26:00.105]  We were being told a, what, 3.6 death rate or whatever, right at the start, potentially.
[02:26:00.842 --> 02:26:13.143]  He took it so seriously, Alex, that while everyone else was locked inside their houses, told they couldn't go out, visit their loved ones' funerals, see their partners, whatever... He was shagging females at parties!
[02:26:14.315 --> 02:26:24.788]  Yeah, he was traveling back and forth across London to shag his married mistress, while everyone else couldn't even see their partner if they lived in a different house.
[02:26:24.788 --> 02:26:33.199]  So again, that tells you how seriously they were taking it, because they knew it wasn't as bad as they were- And Boris Johnson was partying, so what comes next then?
[02:26:35.147 --> 02:26:37.308]  I think it will lead back to Neil Ferguson again.
[02:26:37.308 --> 02:26:41.371]  He was the guy who said, we didn't think we could get away with this.
[02:26:41.371 --> 02:26:48.575]  We didn't think we could get away with what the Chinese were doing, but then we saw Italy doing it and we thought we could get away with it in his words.
[02:26:48.575 --> 02:26:52.437]  So I think obviously there's going to be this big public inquiry.
[02:26:52.437 --> 02:26:54.458]  It's probably going to be a whitewash in the UK, but
[02:26:55.058 --> 02:26:59.761]  Again, you need to trace it back to Neil Ferguson and he links back to the WHO.
[02:26:59.761 --> 02:27:00.561]  No, I totally agree.
[02:27:00.561 --> 02:27:03.403]  That's why I asked you as an expert on this.
[02:27:03.403 --> 02:27:06.944]  But for me, it's such a huge deal because it's gotten attention.
[02:27:06.944 --> 02:27:12.687]  We already could analyze this and see they did this, but now we have these smoking gun admissions.
[02:27:12.687 --> 02:27:14.568]  This has gotten the public's attention.
[02:27:16.653 --> 02:27:19.415]  Michael Malice, this has got to scare the power structure.
[02:27:19.415 --> 02:27:21.897]  I agree with you, but here's the thing I find interesting.
[02:27:21.897 --> 02:27:22.918]  Let's play devil's advocate.
[02:27:22.918 --> 02:27:27.121]  Let's suppose all the COVID narrative was true and that everything was warranted and so on and so forth.
[02:27:27.121 --> 02:27:36.148]  What this demonstrates, and I think it's key, is that politicians, when they see an incentive to make themselves look good or to increase their power, they will take it.
[02:27:36.148 --> 02:27:38.910]  They're not these disinterested public servants.
[02:27:38.910 --> 02:27:45.715]  They see, whether it's Cuomo here, Ferguson over there, or Matt Hancock, it's going to be like, this is going to make me look good.
[02:27:46.195 --> 02:27:56.743]  I get to be the hero, and they are always going to take that opportunity to decrease freedoms and further their own career and agenda, even if everything they said about COVID were true, which of course is not.
[02:27:56.743 --> 02:27:57.123]  I agree.
[02:27:57.123 --> 02:27:59.285]  So any way you slice it, they're going to power it up.
[02:27:59.285 --> 02:27:59.966]  Right.
[02:27:59.966 --> 02:28:02.007]  And pat themselves on the back for it.
[02:28:02.007 --> 02:28:03.188]  And you see it time and time again.
[02:28:03.188 --> 02:28:04.829]  All right, Paul, do one more segment with us.
[02:28:04.829 --> 02:28:10.954]  We're going to go 15 minutes to the next hour with our great host here, who wrote the new book, The White Pill.
[02:28:11.554 --> 02:28:15.197]  We're going to be talking to so many others as well into the next hour.
[02:28:15.197 --> 02:28:16.398]  Michael Malice is here.
[02:28:16.398 --> 02:28:20.162]  But Paul, what else do you want to hit next segment?
[02:28:20.162 --> 02:28:21.603]  Just more on these leaks.
[02:28:21.603 --> 02:28:28.309]  There's more information about how they plan to lock up Nigel Farage face masks and a bunch of different stuff related to the leaks of these messages.
[02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.709]  That's right.
[02:28:28.709 --> 02:28:31.872]  The media is focusing on him face sucking a married woman.
[02:28:31.872 --> 02:28:32.773]  Hey, he didn't hurt anybody.
[02:28:32.773 --> 02:28:34.574]  I'm not saying it's good, but I get it.
[02:28:34.574 --> 02:28:35.415]  I'm a man.
[02:28:35.415 --> 02:28:36.336]  I don't want to hear about that.
[02:28:36.716 --> 02:28:37.998]  I want to hear about locking people down.
[02:28:37.998 --> 02:28:43.104]  I want to hear about lying to the public and using military-level psychology to control folks.
[02:28:43.104 --> 02:28:44.305]  Michael Malice is here.
[02:28:44.305 --> 02:28:46.828]  The White Pill, soon to be a best-selling book.
[02:28:46.828 --> 02:28:48.670]  Paul Joseph Watson with us as well.
[02:28:48.670 --> 02:28:52.855]  One more segment and then myself and Malice will continue on.
[02:28:52.855 --> 02:28:53.796]  Stay with us.
[02:28:53.796 --> 02:28:55.078]  PJW straight ahead.
[02:28:59.232 --> 02:29:11.201]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsaw.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[02:29:11.201 --> 02:29:15.524]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in
[02:29:16.104 --> 02:29:19.546]  Many of you for years have never gone to Infowars.com.
[02:29:19.546 --> 02:29:28.269]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to Infowars.com and never experience these great products and never found the operation.
[02:29:28.269 --> 02:29:31.390]  I'm sure you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[02:29:31.390 --> 02:29:32.331]  That's great and I thank you.

[02:31:58.923 --> 02:32:02.947]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[02:32:02.947 --> 02:32:06.830]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[02:32:06.830 --> 02:32:09.212]  There is a bulletin from PBS News.
[02:32:09.212 --> 02:32:11.594]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[02:32:11.594 --> 02:32:14.136]  This is a different kind of war.
[02:32:14.916 --> 02:32:19.397]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[02:32:19.397 --> 02:32:22.798]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[02:32:22.798 --> 02:32:26.819]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[02:32:26.819 --> 02:32:28.540]  It was almost as if it were a plan in full.
[02:32:28.540 --> 02:32:29.520]  It just can't happen.
[02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:31.480]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[02:32:31.480 --> 02:32:32.081]  That's it!
[02:32:34.742 --> 02:32:36.863]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[02:32:36.863 --> 02:32:38.484]  They are nothing but distractions.
[02:32:38.484 --> 02:32:40.706]  You guys censored Harvard Educated Doctors.
[02:32:40.706 --> 02:32:43.168]  You silenced those voices.
[02:32:43.168 --> 02:32:46.830]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[02:32:46.830 --> 02:32:53.355]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globulars start going to prison!
[02:32:59.269 --> 02:33:13.982]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[02:33:13.982 --> 02:33:21.489]  Big Brother Mainstream Media Government Cover-Ups
[02:33:22.981 --> 02:33:24.661]  You want answers?
[02:33:24.661 --> 02:33:26.822]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:26.822 --> 02:33:33.324]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.324 --> 02:33:36.725]  Alright, final segment with Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:33:36.725 --> 02:33:41.886]  Michael Malice will roll 15 minutes the next hour with me, and the great Gerald Cilente will take over.
[02:33:41.886 --> 02:33:43.146]  But I gotta give Malice this.
[02:33:43.146 --> 02:33:45.327]  He's been writing this book, The White Pill, for two years.
[02:33:46.387 --> 02:33:47.588]  I saw him in New York two years ago.
[02:33:47.588 --> 02:33:48.389]  He was already writing.
[02:33:48.389 --> 02:33:49.490]  He moved here a year and a half ago.
[02:33:49.490 --> 02:33:50.290]  The book is done.
[02:33:50.290 --> 02:33:55.234]  I haven't read the book yet, but just hearing what he's talking about is totally true from history.
[02:33:55.234 --> 02:33:56.595]  The white pill's here.
[02:33:56.595 --> 02:34:02.420]  There are good people getting into the text messages of the British health minister to expose what a criminal he is.
[02:34:02.420 --> 02:34:09.165]  There's all these good people in the intelligence agencies, in corporations, in private life that aren't going to stand by and watch this.
[02:34:09.165 --> 02:34:11.406]  And if we just use the power we have now
[02:34:12.588 --> 02:34:14.549]  We're going to be able to reverse so much of this.
[02:34:14.549 --> 02:34:25.955]  So, Paul, pulling back from Matt Hancock, the UK health minister, being totally caught fear-mongering using British Ministry of Defence propaganda to, quote, mind control and terrorise people.
[02:34:25.955 --> 02:34:27.456]  Big picture.
[02:34:27.456 --> 02:34:29.557]  Fauci's being exposed for gain of function.
[02:34:31.367 --> 02:34:34.070]  All this news is coming out.
[02:34:34.070 --> 02:34:38.614]  European countries are banning the injection.
[02:34:38.614 --> 02:34:41.737]  Things are not going well for the New World Order here, Paul.
[02:34:41.737 --> 02:34:43.498]  I'm not saying we're out of the fight yet.
[02:34:43.498 --> 02:34:44.999]  I'm not saying we've won yet.
[02:34:44.999 --> 02:34:50.244]  But if we were in a boxing match, the sixth round of twelve rounds, I think we'd just knock the son of a bitch out.
[02:34:50.244 --> 02:34:54.048]  He may get back up, but I don't want to declare victory yet because humans aren't perfect.
[02:34:54.048 --> 02:34:55.249]  There'll be some new evil to deal with.
[02:34:55.749 --> 02:34:58.070]  Well, no, obviously it's always a game of brinksmanship.
[02:34:58.070 --> 02:35:01.972]  I think the white pill in terms of COVID is the fact that
[02:35:11.321 --> 02:35:29.423]  All these COVID fines for people who violated lockdown for going for a walk with a cup of coffee, that was one example, for walking their dogs in the remote countryside, basically every single fine that the government tried to impose on people was thrown out of court because no one paid them.
[02:35:29.423 --> 02:35:31.205]  They completely refused to pay them.
[02:35:31.685 --> 02:35:37.390]  You don't even need that level of resistance to upset the apple cart, to derail their agenda.
[02:35:37.390 --> 02:35:38.891]  So that's what we've seen in the aftermath.
[02:35:38.891 --> 02:35:39.531]  You said the key.
[02:35:39.531 --> 02:35:42.113]  We don't have to shoot people, which we don't want to do.
[02:35:42.113 --> 02:35:45.576]  We just have to stop complying.
[02:35:45.576 --> 02:35:48.538]  And demonstrate that they don't have the willpower to force compliance.
[02:35:48.538 --> 02:35:49.299]  That's the other key.
[02:35:50.740 --> 02:36:07.843]  Exactly, and you look at Oxford, these 15 minute WEF cities, you've got a largely left-wing city in Oxford, but because there's a hardcore of resistors in that town, this plan for fining people for driving into certain areas of the city
[02:36:08.499 --> 02:36:11.100]  is completely basically on the ropes now.
[02:36:11.100 --> 02:36:14.701]  You've got people ripping out surveillance cameras across the town of Oxford.
[02:36:14.701 --> 02:36:22.163]  We don't advocate that, but it just shows you the level of resistance and that it only needs to be relatively small scale.
[02:36:22.163 --> 02:36:27.744]  There are polls that show, for example, with this lockdown in the UK, 37% of Brits even now
[02:36:30.157 --> 02:36:37.443]  Which is a larger portion of the population than any who answer differently, say the government didn't lock down hard enough.
[02:36:37.443 --> 02:36:45.409]  So you've got to remember there'll always be this timid, gelded, scared segment of the population, and it's at least a third of the population.
[02:36:45.409 --> 02:36:47.111]  But as you said, the minority doesn't matter.
[02:36:47.111 --> 02:36:49.853]  It's the highly animated minority that matters.
[02:36:49.853 --> 02:36:51.995]  And I don't believe that poll, but absolutely, Paul.
[02:36:53.772 --> 02:37:02.057]  Yeah, and again, this leak just is really embarrassing them, and it's going to make it harder for them to try anything like this in the future.
[02:37:02.057 --> 02:37:11.482]  Just like the narrative on masks has been completely demolished now, with even the New York Times basically coming out and admitting, again, the conspiracy theorists were right all along.
[02:37:11.482 --> 02:37:12.662]  Masks had no effect.
[02:37:12.662 --> 02:37:13.743]  Well, that's another question.
[02:37:13.743 --> 02:37:18.185]  Why do you think even CNN and New York Times propagandists are backpedaling?
[02:37:18.185 --> 02:37:22.808]  I mean, I think they sense that there's a total reversal of their propaganda.
[02:37:24.485 --> 02:37:30.447]  Well, yeah, they call it a COVID amnesty and the rats are starting to flee the sinking ship of the narrative.
[02:37:30.447 --> 02:37:33.669]  But again, their main weapon is and always has been fear.
[02:37:33.669 --> 02:37:45.133]  If they bring back a bird flu type situation, which they're now chattering about in the background, the sheer levels of fear could be used once again to induce this complete subservience within the population.
[02:37:45.133 --> 02:37:48.215]  But again, I think now there's enough people who will resist.
[02:37:48.215 --> 02:37:51.556]  It's too much of a bulwark for them to get their agenda rammed through.
[02:37:51.556 --> 02:37:53.497]  So that's what COVID has given us.
[02:37:53.677 --> 02:37:57.799]  I agree, but they're bringing up bird flu, Marburg, monkeypox, none of it's working.
[02:37:57.799 --> 02:37:59.180]  Michael Malice.
[02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:08.304]  I'm also curious that if you ask the average blue-pilled person, meaning someone who takes the New York Times at face value, do they think the lockdowns actually slowed down the spread of COVID?
[02:38:08.304 --> 02:38:10.305]  Do they think the lockdowns were efficacious?
[02:38:10.305 --> 02:38:13.966]  And if so, why didn't they bring the lockdowns back for later variants?
[02:38:13.966 --> 02:38:18.829]  Like, if you ask someone that simple question, I really don't even know what they'd say because they haven't been given their marching orders.
[02:38:18.829 --> 02:38:20.929]  Well, they're reflecting their power to the states.
[02:38:20.929 --> 02:38:21.650]  They just like the power.
[02:38:22.210 --> 02:38:23.451]  Sure, but I'm talking about the average people.
[02:38:23.451 --> 02:38:24.972]  Do they think the lockdowns had a point?
[02:38:24.972 --> 02:38:26.513]  Do they think that this was a good idea?
[02:38:26.513 --> 02:38:28.235]  And if so, why did they bring them back?
[02:38:28.235 --> 02:38:30.116]  Well, that's a question for both of you.
[02:38:30.116 --> 02:38:31.457]  We've all been vindicated.
[02:38:31.457 --> 02:38:38.402]  You were there three years ago, so was Malice, so was I. Joe Rogan came in a little bit later, but he was there saying this is a fraud.
[02:38:38.402 --> 02:38:39.183]  We've been vindicated.
[02:38:39.183 --> 02:38:41.064]  Do they think now Bill Maher's against it?
[02:38:41.064 --> 02:38:43.866]  Now all these people...
[02:38:45.127 --> 02:38:48.110]  It's a chain reaction.
[02:38:48.110 --> 02:38:49.171]  I mean, I'm not trying to brag.
[02:38:49.171 --> 02:38:50.833]  It's just a gauge.
[02:38:50.833 --> 02:38:53.055]  I flew international this week.
[02:38:53.055 --> 02:38:54.476]  I was mobbed in Mexico.
[02:38:54.476 --> 02:38:55.837]  I was mobbed in the U.S.
[02:38:55.837 --> 02:38:57.339]  Nothing but love.
[02:38:57.339 --> 02:38:58.500]  My food being bought.
[02:38:58.500 --> 02:38:58.960]  Everything.
[02:38:58.960 --> 02:38:59.721]  We're in a restaurant.
[02:38:59.721 --> 02:39:00.822]  There's nothing but listeners.
[02:39:00.822 --> 02:39:04.105]  And it was all like they got a problem.
[02:39:04.105 --> 02:39:07.328]  Alex Jones is getting carried around on people's hands like a mosh pit.
[02:39:08.459 --> 02:39:09.340]  I mean, what are they going to do?
[02:39:09.340 --> 02:39:16.384]  And look how badly things have changed, where before questioning any aspect of COVID, you were completely silenced and kicked off every platform.
[02:39:16.384 --> 02:39:20.046]  And now not only there are no consequences for doing this, there's actually rewards.
[02:39:20.046 --> 02:39:21.887]  And this is that bandwagon effect.
[02:39:21.887 --> 02:39:25.229]  It's really hard when the very tiny percent of the population is saying something.
[02:39:25.229 --> 02:39:32.093]  When you have major entertainment and political pundits saying something and they're being rewarded for it, it becomes that much easier to build up.
[02:39:32.093 --> 02:39:33.513]  And that's where InfoWars comes in.
[02:39:33.513 --> 02:39:35.595]  We've got to say the truth up front when it's hard.
[02:39:36.314 --> 02:39:37.395]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:37.395 --> 02:39:41.320]  Or whoever that small, outspoken minority is going to be on a specific issue, yeah.
[02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:44.845]  Paul, closing comments on this firestorm.
[02:39:44.845 --> 02:39:46.647]  One of the top stories in the world.
[02:39:46.647 --> 02:39:50.352]  The health minister admitting it was all about power and fear and control.
[02:39:50.352 --> 02:39:51.733]  Deploy the new variant.
[02:39:51.733 --> 02:39:52.735]  What happens to this criminal?
[02:39:54.522 --> 02:40:08.211]  Well, he needs to be investigated and if it's proven that he's deliberately chosen an agenda to terrify the British public into falsely believing that this threat was bigger than it was at the time, then he needs to face the most severe punishment possible.
[02:40:08.211 --> 02:40:08.511]  But again,
[02:40:09.236 --> 02:40:22.804]  It disproves also this narrative that is still in place to this day that they didn't know that it was unprecedented what could happen so they went as draconian as possible just to be on the safe side.
[02:40:22.804 --> 02:40:27.787]  These messages show right from the beginning they knew they were exaggerating it.
[02:40:27.787 --> 02:40:29.168]  The government advisors
[02:40:30.014 --> 02:40:30.474]  I don't know.
[02:40:53.814 --> 02:40:55.798]  And by the way, during the break, you brought up the next point.
[02:40:55.798 --> 02:40:58.342]  You said it's not just the 100,000 emails now being gone over.
[02:40:58.342 --> 02:41:00.326]  It's not just COVID, there's a bunch of other stuff there.
[02:41:02.051 --> 02:41:07.596]  Yeah, well, they were told don't put the people coming out of hospital into care homes.
[02:41:07.596 --> 02:41:09.157]  They were all infected.
[02:41:09.157 --> 02:41:10.738]  Those people all died.
[02:41:10.738 --> 02:41:12.740]  The hospitals were completely empty.
[02:41:12.740 --> 02:41:15.442]  We were told that the hospitals were overflowing complete BS.
[02:41:15.442 --> 02:41:17.404]  They were about 40% empty.
[02:41:17.404 --> 02:41:22.729]  And that's the long-term damage of lockdown is killing people who were denied those crucial medical things.
[02:41:22.729 --> 02:41:26.432]  But you were telling me during the break other stuff separate from COVID that's in the text messages.
[02:41:28.171 --> 02:41:47.142]  Well yeah, they were planning on locking up Nigel Farage to make an example of him because he went to a Trump rally, gave a speech, came back to the United Kingdom, took a photo of himself in a pub, but it was within the 14-day window where you're supposed to stay locked up and you're not allowed to go outside, having travelled abroad.
[02:41:47.142 --> 02:41:47.322]  Wow.
[02:41:47.322 --> 02:41:50.023]  So there's a bunch of stuff coming out.
[02:41:50.023 --> 02:41:52.385]  Wow, so how do you think this ends, gut level?
[02:41:54.266 --> 02:42:07.549]  Well, again, there's going to be a public inquiry and it's up to us whether that's a whitewash or whether the people who are responsible for drilling this fear and paranoia into the British public, which has caused massive damage.
[02:42:07.549 --> 02:42:14.370]  Kids, masks, speech therapists saying a 300% increase in autism and speech impediments.
[02:42:14.370 --> 02:42:18.631]  You have suicides of children, which also came out in this leak, by the way.
[02:42:19.191 --> 02:42:22.152]  Suicides of children as a result of lockdown.
[02:42:22.152 --> 02:42:25.593]  You have all these long-term consequences that will reverberate.
[02:42:25.593 --> 02:42:32.395]  Lockdown, long-term, will kill more people than Covid ever killed and that's what they're culpable for.
[02:42:32.395 --> 02:42:35.116]  That's their responsibility and that's why they need to be punished.
[02:42:35.416 --> 02:42:37.118]  A real crime against humanity.
[02:42:37.118 --> 02:42:37.958]  Summit.News.
[02:42:37.958 --> 02:42:40.681]  And they will have no remorse for this whatsoever.
[02:42:40.681 --> 02:42:47.587]  If I had to put in practices that, sure, it's going to be the right thing in the short term to cause kids to kill themselves, I would never be able to live with myself.
[02:42:47.587 --> 02:42:49.609]  They won't lose a second of sleep.
[02:42:49.609 --> 02:42:51.330]  Paul Joseph Watson, Summit.News.
[02:42:51.330 --> 02:42:53.192]  Thank you so much, my friend.
[02:42:53.192 --> 02:42:53.973]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:42:53.973 --> 02:42:55.114]  We'll be back with Michael Malinowski.
[02:42:55.114 --> 02:42:55.574]  Stay with us.
[02:42:55.574 --> 02:42:56.014]  Stay with us.
[02:42:56.014 --> 02:42:56.415]  Stay with us.
[02:42:58.945 --> 02:43:07.130]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globals, in their own words, plan for our future.
[02:43:07.130 --> 02:43:08.591]  That is a hellish future.
[02:43:08.591 --> 02:43:18.016]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarshore.com.
[02:43:18.016 --> 02:43:23.600]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:25.581]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:43:26.161 --> 02:43:31.543]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarshore.com.
[02:43:31.543 --> 02:43:35.484]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:43:35.484 --> 02:43:41.366]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[02:43:41.366 --> 02:43:43.447]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[02:43:44.187 --> 02:43:45.628]  This is their big move.
[02:43:45.628 --> 02:43:49.231]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[02:43:49.231 --> 02:43:49.732]  He doesn't care.
[02:44:10.154 --> 02:44:11.395]  That's not his job.
[02:44:11.395 --> 02:44:13.136]  He's not the President of the United States.
[02:44:13.136 --> 02:44:17.018]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[02:44:17.018 --> 02:44:21.500]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[02:44:21.500 --> 02:44:22.621]  They must be opposed.
[02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:26.661]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[02:44:26.661 --> 02:44:27.861]  No.
[02:44:27.861 --> 02:44:28.681]  No.
[02:44:28.681 --> 02:44:29.461]  No.
[02:44:29.461 --> 02:44:30.342]  Exactly.
[02:44:30.342 --> 02:44:33.923]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[02:44:33.923 --> 02:44:37.023]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[02:44:37.023 --> 02:44:39.504]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[02:44:39.504 --> 02:44:41.984]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[02:44:41.984 --> 02:44:45.605]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[02:44:45.605 --> 02:44:48.126]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[02:44:48.126 --> 02:44:48.546]  You're right!
[02:44:48.826 --> 02:44:53.583]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[02:44:53.583 --> 02:44:55.128]  And we say no to your war!
[02:45:00.706 --> 02:45:07.110]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane place.
[02:45:07.110 --> 02:45:08.871]  World War III has already started.
[02:45:08.871 --> 02:45:11.173]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[02:45:11.173 --> 02:45:12.353]  There's mass censorship.
[02:45:12.353 --> 02:45:14.555]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[02:45:14.555 --> 02:45:16.816]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[02:45:16.816 --> 02:45:21.179]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[02:45:21.459 --> 02:45:25.402]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[02:45:25.402 --> 02:45:33.809]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at InfoWarshaw.com.
[02:45:33.809 --> 02:45:42.497]  And whether it's a final signed copy, they're almost all sold out, or the Great Reset Award for the world, or Ultimate Bone Broth, finally back in stock after over two years, it's all available at InfoWarshaw.com.
[02:45:42.497 --> 02:45:44.078]  These are truly amazing products.
[02:45:44.238 --> 02:45:50.445]  So, get your InfoWars products at InfoWarsStore.com and enrich your life while keeping the broadcast on the air.
[02:45:50.445 --> 02:45:55.030]  It is your decision on whether or not we stay on air, so please take action now at InfoWarsStore.
[02:45:58.618 --> 02:46:00.599]  I've got some good news.
[02:46:00.599 --> 02:46:07.483]  Our high-quality supplements really work, and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[02:46:07.483 --> 02:46:08.323]  That's the good news.
[02:46:08.323 --> 02:46:09.444]  They're amazing.
[02:46:09.444 --> 02:46:17.649]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to InfoWarshaw.com and ever actually buy the products.
[02:46:17.649 --> 02:46:21.090]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the InfoWar.
[02:46:21.090 --> 02:46:26.013]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[02:46:26.013 --> 02:46:26.834]  Think what would happen.
[02:46:27.754 --> 02:46:41.277]  If those of you on the fence actually went to InfoWarStore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects, so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[02:46:41.277 --> 02:46:50.259]  Also, we've got the super high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones, as well.
[02:46:50.259 --> 02:46:51.639]  Or Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:46:51.639 --> 02:46:56.040]  Just go try the product, fund the InfoWar, and help us defeat the new order together.
[02:46:56.040 --> 02:46:57.360]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:46:57.600 --> 02:46:57.801]  Let's go!
[02:47:22.569 --> 02:47:26.331]  Michael Malice is our guest, 15 minutes to the next hour, and I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:47:26.331 --> 02:47:27.771]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:47:27.771 --> 02:47:32.734]  So, great interview with Paul Joseph Watson from Summit.News there.
[02:47:32.734 --> 02:47:40.077]  I could ask a lot of questions, but I want to get back into why you're white-pilled, why you've written the book White-Pilled, and just wherever you want to go, because you're a smart guy.
[02:47:42.231 --> 02:47:51.998]  You know what I want to talk to you about because we haven't talked about this before and I'm very curious because I was the one who wrote the article that kind of started this whole movement and I know you have a lot to say about this subject and it's all going to be all over the map.
[02:47:51.998 --> 02:47:52.799]  Ready?
[02:47:52.799 --> 02:47:59.304]  I want to hear your thoughts about this bubbling under concept of national divorce as a lifelong Texan.
[02:47:59.304 --> 02:48:00.285]  What are your thoughts on the matter?
[02:48:01.526 --> 02:48:16.525]  I particularly don't want to break up the republic, but if the republic's already dead, which it is, and as a debt it can't pay, I think having states pull out and form coalitions to exert their power is one of the purest forms of human democracy.
[02:48:16.525 --> 02:48:17.166]  And Americanism.
[02:48:17.446 --> 02:48:18.107]  I don't think so.
[02:48:35.268 --> 02:48:49.515]  So the other big criticism I always get, and you're literally the one perfect person to ask about this, is this is what the globalists want?
[02:48:49.515 --> 02:48:52.857]  They want America broken up, divide and conquer, divide and conquer.
[02:48:52.857 --> 02:48:59.000]  No one has been fighting the globalists by that name more than you for decades now.
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:00.761]  What is your answer to that criticism?
[02:49:01.201 --> 02:49:02.702]  Well, my answer is this.
[02:49:02.702 --> 02:49:11.430]  They want it broken up with a race war and a cultural divide in the country collapsing, and then Latin America that they control through the IMF World Bank controlling the whole Southwest.
[02:49:11.430 --> 02:49:16.554]  So I say we break it up to fix it, to reconstitute it with a new republic before they do it.
[02:49:16.554 --> 02:49:17.255]  It's real simple.
[02:49:17.255 --> 02:49:28.465]  What about this argument that if America breaks up that we're going to be conquered by China, that it's going to be easier for China to... I don't understand this argument that if Texas becomes, reclaims its independence, that Texas is somehow going to be at the mercy of China.
[02:49:29.005 --> 02:49:29.265]  We're good.
[02:49:45.888 --> 02:49:54.111]  The country's being collapsed, it's being divided culturally, and so a divorce, I think, more and more is a thing that needs to happen.
[02:49:54.111 --> 02:49:56.592]  Yeah, I'm very happy to hear you say this.
[02:49:56.592 --> 02:50:05.275]  It seems to me, and I want to hear your thoughts on this, that this is a relic of neocon Cold War propaganda, because it used to be the Russians are going to invade, the Russians are going to invade, the Russians are going to invade, right?
[02:50:05.975 --> 02:50:12.800]  Cold War ends, the Soviet Union falls apart and ceases to exist, and now the argument is, China's going to invade, China's going to invade, China's going to invade.
[02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:24.748]  Even if we, let's just steel man this argument, even if we broke up into two countries of 175 million people each, the idea that this would be a cakewalk for China to invade, and the other argument is, okay, well they don't mean literally invade, they're going to invade us culturally.
[02:50:24.748 --> 02:50:31.452]  It's much easier now when you have Washington under the thumb and the university system kowtowing to kind of China.
[02:50:31.452 --> 02:50:32.973]  Yeah, the confusion, exactly.
[02:50:32.973 --> 02:50:35.275]  We're already conquered by the new world order.
[02:50:36.055 --> 02:50:41.840]  And so when the founders said, 1776, it wasn't to lessen the power of the people, it was to enforce it.
[02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:50.267]  So I would look for coalitions to pull out, create new compacts, and then create a new order, which we see in the Declaration of Independence.
[02:50:50.267 --> 02:50:59.154]  When the government becomes destructive of the people's freedom, it is not just our right, it is our duty to abolish the former forms of government and reconstitute new governments for the people.
[02:50:59.154 --> 02:51:05.159]  What about this idea, if Texas became a republic, that we'd all starve and we wouldn't be able to have the lights on and we'd be begging to come crawling back?
[02:51:05.299 --> 02:51:08.720]  We have enough oil to run the whole planet for 150 years.
[02:51:08.720 --> 02:51:09.761]  We have the gas.
[02:51:09.761 --> 02:51:10.861]  We have the technology.
[02:51:10.861 --> 02:51:13.562]  We have a frickin' NASA's base here.
[02:51:13.562 --> 02:51:14.263]  I love New Yorkers.
[02:51:14.263 --> 02:51:14.743]  They're great people.
[02:51:14.743 --> 02:51:16.383]  They come and they go, are you riding horses around?
[02:51:16.383 --> 02:51:18.964]  Yeah, we got horses and we got, you know, everything else.
[02:51:18.964 --> 02:51:23.866]  The point is, I'm not calling for a dissolution of the Republic.
[02:51:23.866 --> 02:51:25.247]  It already happened.
[02:51:25.247 --> 02:51:31.489]  I'm calling for people to recognize it and only having the states pull out to then reconvene.
[02:51:31.489 --> 02:51:32.250]  I think the minute
[02:51:33.050 --> 02:51:41.698]  Texas pulled out, Oklahoma and a bunch of other states would join us, then we'd have a coalition and an issue to get the Republic reconstituted.
[02:51:41.698 --> 02:51:47.343]  It would be a straight line from here to Canada because you'd have Oklahoma, you'd have Nebraska, you'd have the Dakotas, like in two seconds.
[02:51:47.343 --> 02:51:50.826]  Exactly, and it's kind of like your wife filing for divorce to get your attention.
[02:51:50.826 --> 02:51:51.667]  Right, right, right.
[02:51:51.667 --> 02:51:54.009]  It's like, you need to stop right now.
[02:51:54.629 --> 02:52:08.317]  Uh, the other big argument is that, um, what happens to people who are, you know, you have, the thing is they're like, okay, it's not going to divide evenly because you're going to have blue cities and red and red rural areas, but that's kind of the status quo now.
[02:52:08.317 --> 02:52:12.379]  But we'll control the legislatures and so all that Soros control will be cut off.
[02:52:12.379 --> 02:52:14.940]  They'll get off that Soros ding dong real fast.
[02:52:14.940 --> 02:52:19.903]  The other argument is, I don't want to cede an inch of this Republic to, you know, the
[02:52:20.123 --> 02:52:21.743]  Borders are already gone.
[02:52:21.743 --> 02:52:23.244]  Currency's already being destroyed.
[02:52:23.244 --> 02:52:24.544]  Country's already gone.
[02:52:24.544 --> 02:52:26.805]  What is the plan for retaking Portland?
[02:52:26.805 --> 02:52:31.106]  Like, literally, there's no plan for people who are... I think it's like escape from New York.
[02:52:31.106 --> 02:52:32.586]  We just wall it off and they can kill each other.
[02:52:32.586 --> 02:52:39.428]  Right, but the idea that somehow, like, conservatives and Republicans are going to impose their worldview on Portland is so... No, no, no.
[02:52:39.428 --> 02:52:39.968]  Exactly.
[02:52:39.968 --> 02:52:45.149]  We can, like, say, okay, you support pedophilia and all the rest of this, you can have your own area.
[02:52:45.149 --> 02:52:45.309]  Yeah.
[02:52:45.871 --> 02:52:50.774]  Like, there's no model for reclaiming Portland to have it be... Well, no, I mean, I've come to that point.
[02:52:50.774 --> 02:52:53.876]  Constitutional conventions aren't what's needed in any of that.
[02:52:53.876 --> 02:53:00.619]  I think if Texas voted to secede and put out its list of demands, I think like dominoes it would all fall.
[02:53:00.619 --> 02:53:01.700]  We'd have the country back in five minutes.
[02:53:01.960 --> 02:53:04.923]  Yeah, I don't know about five minutes, but it's certainly a step in the right direction.
[02:53:04.923 --> 02:53:06.084]  I'm in the political time span.
[02:53:06.084 --> 02:53:15.533]  Yes, and the other thing is, when you are in a relationship that's not advantageous, as soon as you throw out that you've got a foot out the door, all of a sudden the tension in the room changes.
[02:53:15.533 --> 02:53:16.314]  Let's suppose this.
[02:53:16.314 --> 02:53:20.638]  Let's suppose I'm working for you, Alex, and I'm thinking about getting another job, and I want a raise.
[02:53:20.638 --> 02:53:21.879]  If I had another job offer,
[02:53:22.259 --> 02:53:25.342]  With more money, I'm in a much better position.
[02:53:25.342 --> 02:53:29.026]  So if you're like, hey, I've got this offer for twice the money, you're going to match this.
[02:53:29.026 --> 02:53:31.689]  Yeah, as opposed to like, maybe I'm going to have to look for work.
[02:53:31.689 --> 02:53:40.418]  So if Texas puts this on the table and they're taking steps to actually become the Republic of Texas once again, I think things are going to change very quickly.
[02:53:40.418 --> 02:53:45.183]  And in the time of Eisenhower in the 60s, he said, as Texas goes, so goes the country.
[02:53:45.703 --> 02:53:50.828]  And we've already got the UN and global corporations, the WUF, and the CHICOM dictating.
[02:53:50.828 --> 02:53:52.669]  How about we start dictating?
[02:53:52.669 --> 02:53:53.550]  Right, right.
[02:53:53.550 --> 02:53:54.271]  That's the point.
[02:53:54.271 --> 02:54:00.296]  Why is it that the enemy class always sets the terms of debate as opposed to people who are hardcore patriots?
[02:54:00.296 --> 02:54:02.758]  And patriots mean salvaging of America when you still can.
[02:54:02.978 --> 02:54:06.421]  I think we call it the New American Coalition or something along those lines.
[02:54:06.421 --> 02:54:07.902]  The New American States.
[02:54:07.902 --> 02:54:13.886]  And then we just have states say, the legislatures have all voted to leave if you don't follow set demands.
[02:54:13.886 --> 02:54:16.688]  So there's nothing to even lead to leave.
[02:54:16.688 --> 02:54:21.091]  We just, we voted, half the states are leaving, here's our demands.
[02:54:21.091 --> 02:54:23.653]  And then let the feds try to come in with weapons.
[02:54:23.653 --> 02:54:25.014]  Because their whole military will join us.
[02:54:26.295 --> 02:54:30.577]  Even if it was just four states or three states, like, there's no way... Oh, I think Texas alone would break it.
[02:54:30.577 --> 02:54:31.358]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[02:54:31.358 --> 02:54:38.322]  I mean, because Texas is absolutely gigantic and the population are very, very loyal to this lovely state that I'm delighted to be a citizen of.
[02:54:39.096 --> 02:54:42.517]  Well, we have to have these discussions because that's the type of bold move that would fix this.
[02:54:42.517 --> 02:54:43.237]  Yeah, right.
[02:54:43.237 --> 02:54:47.078]  Like China wants Hong Kong and Taiwan that have been part of them for 70 years.
[02:54:47.078 --> 02:54:49.698]  Imagine if the heart of the country says we're gone.
[02:54:49.698 --> 02:54:52.599]  I mean, that shifts the whole power structure.
[02:54:52.599 --> 02:54:55.399]  And a lot of people are thinking this is crazy, this could never happen.
[02:54:55.399 --> 02:55:05.421]  Let me tell everyone watching this, if it was 2014 and I said to you that Donald Trump is going to be the next president, you would laugh in my face and call me a lunatic or worse.
[02:55:05.421 --> 02:55:08.642]  So it is currently part of the Texas Republican Party's platform.
[02:55:09.002 --> 02:55:12.403]  To have a referendum, I think is the term that they're arguing for.
[02:55:12.403 --> 02:55:14.563]  To have Texas declare its independence.
[02:55:14.563 --> 02:55:17.684]  And I think this kind of thing is going to happen a lot quicker than people realize.
[02:55:17.684 --> 02:55:21.565]  And I think the way to get it passed, as you said, they've got the votes of the legislature probably.
[02:55:21.565 --> 02:55:23.466]  And it's on, it's in the platform.
[02:55:23.466 --> 02:55:24.866]  So that's half the battle, folks.
[02:55:24.866 --> 02:55:26.266]  The idea, it's done.
[02:55:26.266 --> 02:55:30.167]  Like, oh, what are people in Philadelphia, you know, they're going to beat the British Empire?
[02:55:30.167 --> 02:55:30.767]  Nobody beat it.
[02:55:30.767 --> 02:55:31.468]  It happened.
[02:55:31.468 --> 02:55:32.308]  Right.
[02:55:32.308 --> 02:55:37.369]  So if we just put it on the table, that causes a whole new debate about we don't recognize this power structure.
[02:55:37.609 --> 02:55:37.689]  And
[02:55:52.802 --> 02:55:55.024]  And again, I'll be very clear, Michael, you're totally right.
[02:55:55.024 --> 02:55:58.346]  We have outside global corporations already dictating us.
[02:55:58.346 --> 02:56:07.033]  So it's not that we want to destroy America, we want to save it by pulling out of it to reconstitute and say we don't recognize this occupied structure.
[02:56:07.033 --> 02:56:08.194]  Right, right.
[02:56:08.194 --> 02:56:18.422]  And at a certain point you have to realize, listen, I know a lot of people watching the show in the military, ex-military, is your vision of America one in which Kamala Harris is commander in chief?
[02:56:18.422 --> 02:56:19.262]  Because that's not my vision.
[02:56:20.143 --> 02:56:26.346]  The FBI with their informants puts out the message of militias and violence, let's kill some cops, let's blow up a Justice Department building.
[02:56:26.346 --> 02:56:28.407]  That's the last thing you do, it turns them into victims.
[02:56:28.407 --> 02:56:34.871]  We win by soft power, by intellectual ideas, and the polls show the majority of Americans want to secede.
[02:56:34.871 --> 02:56:35.871]  They're done.
[02:56:35.871 --> 02:56:40.434]  We secede from the false thing to tell it it's not us to reconstitute it.
[02:56:40.794 --> 02:56:45.536]  And look how much things have moved positively in terms of gun rights on a state-by-state basis.
[02:56:45.536 --> 02:56:49.278]  Look how much things have moved positively in terms of school choice.
[02:56:49.278 --> 02:56:50.999]  Even the Supreme Court's getting on board.
[02:56:50.999 --> 02:56:51.299]  Right.
[02:56:51.299 --> 02:56:58.783]  In just a couple of years, school choice has become the law of the land in state after state after state after parents saw what was being done in their schools.
[02:56:58.783 --> 02:56:59.623]  So let me say it.
[02:56:59.623 --> 02:57:03.265]  I am calling for us now to file for divorce.
[02:57:03.265 --> 02:57:03.465]  Yes.
[02:57:05.412 --> 02:57:08.655]  It's a great day in America, I think, and a great day to be a Texan.
[02:57:08.655 --> 02:57:11.578]  Because, again, it's not our republic.
[02:57:11.578 --> 02:57:16.863]  Our husband or our wife is a globalist, New World Order, Chai Com tyrant.
[02:57:16.863 --> 02:57:18.304]  It's not our country.
[02:57:18.304 --> 02:57:28.273]  You hear these stories of these moms taking the kids and injecting them with hormones and sterilizing them, and the dad has to sit at home and there's nothing he can do because the law is against him.
[02:57:28.273 --> 02:57:31.936]  That's the kind of state that America is in right now, is a parallel, in my opinion.
[02:57:32.076 --> 02:57:33.557]  And they go, oh, you're anti-whatever.
[02:57:33.557 --> 02:57:35.399]  No, if adults are something, I'm totally for it.
[02:57:35.399 --> 02:57:37.441]  Like Blair White, great person, love her.
[02:57:37.441 --> 02:57:39.442]  But the point is, don't do it to kids.
[02:57:39.442 --> 02:57:40.803]  Adults make their choices.
[02:57:40.803 --> 02:57:42.585]  And that's how Washington sees you.
[02:57:42.585 --> 02:57:43.706]  They see you as a gang of pigs.
[02:57:43.706 --> 02:57:46.168]  They do not care about your family, your freedoms in the slightest.
[02:57:48.809 --> 02:57:57.016]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globals, in their own words, plan for our future.
[02:57:57.016 --> 02:57:58.457]  That is a hellish future.
[02:57:58.457 --> 02:58:07.385]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsware.com.
[02:58:07.865 --> 02:58:13.447]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[02:58:13.447 --> 02:58:16.048]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:58:16.048 --> 02:58:21.409]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarshaw.com.
[02:58:21.409 --> 02:58:25.350]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:58:25.350 --> 02:58:31.252]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[02:58:31.252 --> 02:58:33.333]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[02:58:34.113 --> 02:58:35.175]  Or unsigned copies.
[02:58:35.175 --> 02:58:45.529]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[02:58:45.529 --> 02:58:46.571]  This is an InfoWar.
[02:58:46.571 --> 02:58:48.474]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[02:58:48.474 --> 02:58:49.415]  I've got some good news.
[02:58:50.436 --> 02:58:57.318]  Our high quality supplements really work and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[02:58:57.318 --> 02:58:58.138]  That's the good news.
[02:58:58.138 --> 02:58:59.278]  They're amazing.
[02:58:59.278 --> 02:59:07.460]  The bad news is around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to Infowarshaw.com and ever actually buy the products.
[02:59:07.460 --> 02:59:10.901]  So you're missing out on these products plus it funds the Infowar.
[02:59:10.901 --> 02:59:15.823]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[02:59:15.823 --> 02:59:16.663]  Think what would happen.
[02:59:17.583 --> 02:59:31.112]  If those of you on the fence actually went to InfoWarStore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects, so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[02:59:31.112 --> 02:59:40.098]  Also, we've got the super high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones, as well.
[02:59:40.098 --> 02:59:41.479]  Or Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:59:41.479 --> 02:59:45.882]  Just go try the product, fund the InfoWar, and help us defeat the new order together.
[02:59:45.882 --> 02:59:47.203]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:59:47.383 --> 02:59:47.483]  Wow.
[03:00:08.700 --> 03:00:11.262]  Two more segments left with Michael Malice.
[03:00:11.262 --> 03:00:13.803]  The White Pills, his new book that's out.
[03:00:13.803 --> 03:00:15.504]  Malice, take over.
[03:00:15.504 --> 03:00:25.831]  I was just very heartened to see what got you to the point, because you're a big patriot, you talk a lot about how much you love America, as do I. Why is my phone going off when I have it off?
[03:00:25.831 --> 03:00:30.954]  What brought you to the point where you thought, okay, we can't salvage this system through Washington?
[03:00:32.150 --> 03:00:35.734]  Well, they're ready for a violent attack, they're provocateuring it.
[03:00:35.734 --> 03:00:39.477]  Culturally, the general public doesn't get it in blue states.
[03:00:39.477 --> 03:00:47.585]  So, instead of having a violent civil war, we have a cultural civil war, and people use their Declaration of Independence rights to pull out.
[03:00:47.585 --> 03:00:50.508]  That gives us all the peaceful leverage to demand the country back.
[03:00:50.948 --> 03:00:54.390]  Here's an argument against national divorce that I do not find cogent.
[03:00:54.390 --> 03:00:56.632]  The argument is they'll never let you leave.
[03:00:56.632 --> 03:00:58.173]  They'll never let you have your own country.
[03:00:58.173 --> 03:01:01.875]  But the thing is, you don't hear about what's going on in Canada.
[03:01:01.875 --> 03:01:03.836]  You don't hear what's going on in Mexico.
[03:01:03.836 --> 03:01:09.840]  They've completely stopped talking, and they have a reason to, about the plight of women in Afghanistan and the Taliban.
[03:01:09.840 --> 03:01:11.041]  That's the real problem.
[03:01:11.041 --> 03:01:13.363]  What's happening to these women is really horrible.
[03:01:13.363 --> 03:01:16.565]  But because they don't have a narrative, they just gave up on pretending it's not happening.
[03:01:17.245 --> 03:01:23.286]  If America did split up and Texas gained its independence, yeah, they would care ostensibly, but they wouldn't do anything about it.
[03:01:23.286 --> 03:01:26.687]  We see this case after case where there's all these atrocities happening.
[03:01:26.687 --> 03:01:30.247]  Well, the point is it brings them to the table.
[03:01:30.247 --> 03:01:31.167]  Right.
[03:01:31.167 --> 03:01:31.447]  Right.
[03:01:31.447 --> 03:01:35.128]  So I'm very hopeful that this is something that's going to happen.
[03:01:35.128 --> 03:01:36.628]  Here's the other argument.
[03:01:36.628 --> 03:01:39.869]  They're never going to let us leave, and it's going to be absolutely violent.
[03:01:39.869 --> 03:01:41.189]  It's another Civil War, too.
[03:01:41.189 --> 03:01:43.090]  We tried this once before.
[03:01:43.090 --> 03:01:45.430]  Do you think that's true, that it would not be able to happen peacefully?
[03:01:46.428 --> 03:01:51.751]  I think we know the globalists are planning to have a race war and a civil war to bring down the country under U.N.
[03:01:51.751 --> 03:01:52.311]  control.
[03:01:52.311 --> 03:01:54.552]  I say we do it before they do it peacefully.
[03:01:54.552 --> 03:01:58.134]  But the thing is they're going to say, well, it's not going to be able to happen peacefully.
[03:01:58.134 --> 03:02:03.457]  If Texas declared its independence, it would be invaded and decimated by Washington and the military.
[03:02:03.457 --> 03:02:05.278]  Do you think that's true or necessarily true?
[03:02:05.278 --> 03:02:06.238]  No, no one would put up that.
[03:02:06.238 --> 03:02:07.179]  They have no reason to do that.
[03:02:07.799 --> 03:02:08.680]  It's an information war.
[03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:10.200]  They have no support to do it.
[03:02:10.200 --> 03:02:19.365]  Right, but I mean, can you speak to the people at home who think that like as soon as Texas secedes, we would be just completely General Sherman?
[03:02:19.365 --> 03:02:24.828]  I mean, I would just tell them that they're out of their minds because... I mean, look at all the factors.
[03:02:24.828 --> 03:02:26.329]  The public's ready to do it.
[03:02:26.329 --> 03:02:28.050]  Washington's illegitimate.
[03:02:28.050 --> 03:02:31.571]  What is their excuse to invade and attack?
[03:02:31.571 --> 03:02:33.773]  I mean, the military is awake on average.
[03:02:33.773 --> 03:02:34.433]  I don't see it working.
[03:02:34.753 --> 03:02:45.958]  Yeah, I don't see it either, and I think it's really easier to convince the military to invade another country than to convince the military to fire its own citizenry.
[03:02:45.958 --> 03:02:51.660]  It's very different when you have the Civil War in the South and the Confederacy, which is really regarded as this kind of malevolent evil force.
[03:02:52.260 --> 03:02:54.242]  Yeah, we're not promoting slavery.
[03:02:54.242 --> 03:02:55.984]  No, but that's the way to non-violently do it.
[03:03:12.312 --> 03:03:15.394]  Because they're already planning to break the country up using race war and the rest of it.
[03:03:15.394 --> 03:03:18.056]  Why not break it up now to reconstitute it?
[03:03:18.056 --> 03:03:29.943]  Yeah, I'm very heartened to hear you say this, and I'm curious if you're going to get pushback from the audience, because a lot of people are like, no, no, no, you're just giving up, this is surrender, this is what they want, and I don't think that's what they want.
[03:03:29.943 --> 03:03:33.826]  I think globalism, by definition, wants one organization.
[03:03:33.826 --> 03:03:36.327]  Well, they want to break it up and then reconstitute it.
[03:03:36.327 --> 03:03:41.691]  But if the producing states pull out and cut the others off, they've got to stop.
[03:03:42.111 --> 03:03:43.052]  Right, right.
[03:03:43.052 --> 03:03:50.278]  And the idea that Texas couldn't be its own country, let alone Texas allied with several other states, to me is just an absolute absurdity.
[03:03:50.278 --> 03:03:55.303]  And I think that's kind of the best way to save the next generation and keep them from being brainwashed in government schools.
[03:03:55.865 --> 03:04:00.088]  Alright, you're going to host the last segment because I love to talk, but I'm going to talk and interrupt the whole time.
[03:04:00.088 --> 03:04:02.930]  So we've got a ten minute segment coming up after this one minute break.
[03:04:02.930 --> 03:04:10.256]  Michael Malice, you are going to host the last ten minutes about your book and what else is in it and why people should read it.
[03:04:10.256 --> 03:04:11.957]  Okay, well I'm looking forward to that.
[03:04:11.957 --> 03:04:13.138]  I think I've got a lot to say.
[03:04:13.138 --> 03:04:14.559]  And you've got your own show.
[03:04:14.559 --> 03:04:15.079]  You're welcome.
[03:04:15.079 --> 03:04:16.260]  My show is called You're Welcome.
[03:04:16.260 --> 03:04:17.161]  Here's the t-shirt.
[03:04:17.161 --> 03:04:18.462]  It's a complete disaster.
[03:04:18.462 --> 03:04:20.123]  I don't have a nice studio like Alex's.
[03:04:20.123 --> 03:04:20.904]  Oh, give me a break.
[03:04:20.904 --> 03:04:21.744]  It's great.
[03:04:21.744 --> 03:04:22.425]  I love going on there.
[03:04:23.185 --> 03:04:27.686]  We've got a lot of views, we have a lot of fun.
[03:04:27.686 --> 03:04:37.709]  By the way, I've got to tell you, I'm very, very happy, I say this constantly, we're going to be together on stage with Alex Stein and Blair White and Tim Pool on April 14th here on 6th Street.
[03:04:37.709 --> 03:04:41.410]  Are you going to go to Joe Rogan's secret opening tomorrow?
[03:04:41.410 --> 03:04:42.671]  Oh, I guess so.
[03:04:42.671 --> 03:04:43.231]  I'll find out.
[03:04:43.231 --> 03:04:44.191]  I'm going to be on Joe tomorrow.
[03:04:44.191 --> 03:04:45.632]  No, it's a secret.
[03:04:45.632 --> 03:04:48.252]  You don't know what the secret is.
[03:04:48.252 --> 03:04:48.853]  I'll tell you about it.
[03:04:50.634 --> 03:04:51.537]  I know he has.
[03:04:51.537 --> 03:04:52.560]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[03:04:59.600 --> 03:05:09.309]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.

[03:05:48.629 --> 03:05:51.070]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[03:05:51.070 --> 03:05:51.951]  We didn't have them for sale.
[03:05:51.951 --> 03:05:53.692]  But now, I signed the last books.
[03:05:53.692 --> 03:06:06.959]  You can get them right now.
[03:06:06.959 --> 03:06:12.963]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:15.842 --> 03:06:18.583]  Well, the great Michael Malice, his new book is out.
[03:06:18.583 --> 03:06:20.604]  That should be a bestseller, The White Pill.
[03:06:20.604 --> 03:06:25.366]  You can find him at MichaelMalice.com and at MichaelMalice on Twitter.
[03:06:25.366 --> 03:06:28.267]  And I'm going to let you host this segment.
[03:06:28.267 --> 03:06:31.388]  I want to hear what you have to say about the book, about what's happening.
[03:06:31.388 --> 03:06:32.528]  You're going to be on Joe Rogan tomorrow.
[03:06:32.528 --> 03:06:33.709]  That's going to be huge.
[03:06:33.709 --> 03:06:34.829]  So much more happening here.
[03:06:34.829 --> 03:06:38.390]  And the great ATX, Michael Malice, I'm glad you came to the studio.
[03:06:38.390 --> 03:06:39.851]  Tell us about The White Pill and what it means.
[03:06:40.293 --> 03:06:46.578]  Well, there's two things I want people to take away from this book and just, even if you don't read the book, just take away in terms of looking at politics in general.
[03:06:46.578 --> 03:06:51.161]  And the first is that the Americans are very naive about the nature of evil.
[03:06:51.161 --> 03:06:57.446]  They really think evil means someone with a crazy mustache who's banging their fists on the table, who's spouting crazy nonsense.
[03:06:57.446 --> 03:07:05.272]  But more often than not, it's just some loser who's only in that political position because they're preaching the party line, because they're being politically correct.
[03:07:05.632 --> 03:07:05.852]  I'm good.
[03:07:21.582 --> 03:07:23.882]  They just tend to be loyal to the regime.
[03:07:23.882 --> 03:07:29.884]  A great example of this was someone named Lysenko, who was a big biologist in the Soviet Union.
[03:07:29.884 --> 03:07:35.765]  He claimed he was crossing with potatoes and tomatoes and all this other stuff, and he opposed genetics.
[03:07:35.765 --> 03:07:40.026]  And he opposed genetics because genetics wasn't compatible, in his view, with Marxism.
[03:07:40.026 --> 03:07:44.347]  And because of this, Soviet biology was an embarrassment and was set back decades.
[03:07:44.347 --> 03:07:46.047]  It became an international laughingstock.
[03:07:46.047 --> 03:07:50.308]  But the point is, these people, A, their ideas do not work.
[03:07:50.908 --> 03:07:53.950]  That is one important reason to be hopeful.
[03:07:53.950 --> 03:08:00.454]  If these ideologies were successful and created prosperity for everyone, well, we'd be in favor of them.
[03:08:00.454 --> 03:08:03.216]  But the fact is, they don't work even for the leaders in charge.
[03:08:03.216 --> 03:08:10.661]  They have power, but that power tends to be a precarious one because it's not based on honesty or on facts.
[03:08:10.661 --> 03:08:12.402]  So that's an important key to take away.
[03:08:12.402 --> 03:08:13.522]  Second is realize...
[03:08:14.468 --> 03:08:17.410]  That there's nothing you can put past these people.
[03:08:17.410 --> 03:08:22.893]  You know, I go after case after case about how they put people on trial, knowing they were innocent.
[03:08:22.893 --> 03:08:31.297]  They made a priest denounce God from the pulpit just to kind of prove that religion is the opiate of the masses, in their view.
[03:08:31.297 --> 03:08:42.163]  They had a story called Pavlik Morozov, the story they told to schoolchildren, where the moral of the story is, if your dad or your mom is doing something wrong, you should turn them into the police.
[03:08:42.623 --> 03:08:47.247]  This is something that kids were taught in the Soviet Union for a very long time.
[03:08:47.247 --> 03:08:51.210]  So, again, there is nothing that these people would hold holy.
[03:08:51.210 --> 03:08:57.035]  But the fact of the matter is, in nation after nation, they were peacefully overthrown.
[03:08:57.035 --> 03:09:07.043]  A great example is in East Germany, as it kind of alludes to what we were talking earlier with Alex and Paul Joseph Wattinson, because they would have protests in a city in East Germany called Leipzig.
[03:09:07.603 --> 03:09:14.388]  And at first the protests were few, and you're protesting in a country where protesting is illegal, and you're like, okay, you're really sticking your neck out.
[03:09:14.388 --> 03:09:22.633]  And in any kind of revolution, peaceful or otherwise, it's going to be those few people who are speaking truth to power who are the ones who are putting their necks out.
[03:09:22.633 --> 03:09:26.416]  But what happens quickly is, when you see that nothing happens to them,
[03:09:27.216 --> 03:09:27.917]  Others join in.
[03:09:27.917 --> 03:09:31.039]  They're like, wait a minute, that small group didn't get punished.
[03:09:31.039 --> 03:09:33.481]  If I join in, I'm not going to get punished.
[03:09:33.481 --> 03:09:40.866]  And step by step, these organizations build up until it becomes a tidal wave that cannot be overcome.
[03:09:40.866 --> 03:09:42.507]  This happened in East Germany at a certain point.
[03:09:42.507 --> 03:09:53.855]  Honecker, who was the head of East Germany, was looking at the TV screen, seeing these marches of literally hundreds of thousands of people in East Berlin chanting, we are the people and chanting no violence.
[03:09:54.255 --> 03:10:05.321]  And he called for another Tiananmen Square, where everyone I'm sure remembers this June 4th, 1989, when they sent in the tanks and killed all those protesters in Communist China in Tiananmen Square.
[03:10:05.321 --> 03:10:09.503]  And the head of the military, I believe it was, looked at him and said, we can't do anything.
[03:10:09.983 --> 03:10:13.464]  We are going to let matters proceed peacefully.
[03:10:13.464 --> 03:10:18.906]  And that is the mechanism, in my view, for effective, liberating social change.
[03:10:18.906 --> 03:10:25.968]  It's going to take a few brave patriots, freedom fighters, whatever term you want to call yourself, to stick their necks out.
[03:10:25.968 --> 03:10:27.208]  We're already way past that point.
[03:10:27.668 --> 03:10:33.811]  There are so many people in this country, both public figures and private individuals, who are like, this isn't working.
[03:10:33.811 --> 03:10:35.051]  The system is corrupt.
[03:10:35.051 --> 03:10:36.772]  These people are malevolent.
[03:10:36.772 --> 03:10:43.274]  And after that, it's much, much easier for others to jump on the bandwagon and to make effective change.
[03:10:43.274 --> 03:10:45.695]  Here's an issue that's just not really political.
[03:10:45.695 --> 03:10:46.516]  Drug legalization.
[03:10:47.176 --> 03:10:52.701]  It is still illegal in every state to have marijuana dispensaries because it's federal crime.
[03:10:52.701 --> 03:10:59.528]  But what people looked around and saw is, yes, the crime is still on the books, the law is still on the books, but they're not raiding these dispensaries.
[03:10:59.528 --> 03:11:04.872]  They're not arresting these people who are selling joints or whatever it is for medical reasons.
[03:11:04.872 --> 03:11:11.559]  And that's quickly how, even though the law itself has not changed, the enforcement of the law has become abolished.
[03:11:11.559 --> 03:11:12.560]  So it's a matter of
[03:11:13.260 --> 03:11:14.521]  Uh, defiance.
[03:11:14.521 --> 03:11:25.272]  It's a matter of recognizing that anything that has to be implemented comes at a great cost, uh, either financial or psychological or emotional to the ruling class.
[03:11:25.272 --> 03:11:31.178]  And at a certain point, they're gonna run out of money in their bank, whether it's emotional fuel or financial fuel.
[03:11:31.178 --> 03:11:32.740]  And when that happens, the jig is up.
[03:11:33.700 --> 03:11:35.021]  This is a microcosm.
[03:11:35.021 --> 03:11:36.922]  Joe Biden can hardly talk.
[03:11:36.922 --> 03:11:38.963]  They say he's going to be the next nominee.
[03:11:38.963 --> 03:11:41.824]  Why would a power structure put forward a Fetterman or a Joe Biden?
[03:11:41.824 --> 03:11:42.825]  What are they looking for?
[03:11:42.825 --> 03:11:44.706]  Well, I think there's two arguments here.
[03:11:44.706 --> 03:11:54.471]  One is this shows how powerful they are, that they can either drag this carcass or this Sasquatch across the finish line successfully.
[03:11:55.371 --> 03:12:01.537]  Or, this just shows how weak they are, that these are who's left to represent the regime.
[03:12:01.537 --> 03:12:04.100]  And frankly, to me, it seems clearly the second one.
[03:12:04.100 --> 03:12:15.050]  Because if you look at, like, aristocrats, and something called the Habsburg Jaw, you have the Habsburg dynasty, and they were so inbred, literally inbred, that the last guy, he couldn't even really close his mouth, and his jaw was all huge and deformed.
[03:12:15.050 --> 03:12:17.473]  You can look this up in the internet photos of the Habsburg dynasty.
[03:12:17.473 --> 03:12:18.293]  Habsburg Jaw, yeah.
[03:12:18.293 --> 03:12:19.014]  Habsburg Jaw.
[03:12:20.135 --> 03:12:27.520]  What happens is these regimes, they become decadent and inbred, literally in that case, but figuratively nowadays.
[03:12:27.520 --> 03:12:30.122]  And the people who are being drawn into the power structure, watch it.
[03:12:30.122 --> 03:12:36.666]  If you look at FDR, if you look at Woodrow Wilson, these are very bright men, these are very charismatic men, these are very powerful men.
[03:12:36.966 --> 03:12:43.670]  Can you seriously look at the people in Washington today and think they're anything like these giants of the past?
[03:12:43.670 --> 03:12:46.352]  That they're anything like, have any amount of charisma?
[03:12:46.352 --> 03:12:52.155]  FDR had so many Democrats in Congress, they had to spill over and sit into the Republican seats.
[03:12:52.155 --> 03:13:00.180]  Can you see anyone in the Democratic Party, or even a bad actor in the Republican Party, who's able to unite the country so much behind them and their agenda?
[03:13:00.180 --> 03:13:00.881]  I don't see it at all.
[03:13:01.761 --> 03:13:04.324]  Well, that's why I think we're in the middle of the Great Awakening.
[03:13:04.324 --> 03:13:17.578]  Yes, and I think if you look at what information is accessible to us as average citizens in 2023, as opposed to the information that was accessible to us when you and I were kids, it's night and day.
[03:13:18.198 --> 03:13:20.700]  Thanks to the internet, thanks to social media, thanks to shows like this.
[03:13:20.700 --> 03:13:24.723]  So they can try to censor, they can try to control, but it's all a rear-guard action.
[03:13:24.723 --> 03:13:27.064]  Alex, if they had their way, you wouldn't exist.
[03:13:27.064 --> 03:13:29.086]  If they had their way, you'd be in solitary confinement.
[03:13:29.086 --> 03:13:29.946]  Is that not clear?
[03:13:29.946 --> 03:13:30.727]  Yes.
[03:13:30.727 --> 03:13:35.690]  And the fact is, we're having a nice lunch, we're gonna go shoot in a few weeks, and we're having a good time.
[03:13:35.690 --> 03:13:37.952]  You're under a lot of pressure, you're under a lot of stress.
[03:13:37.952 --> 03:13:40.533]  But again, they haven't been able to banish you or silence you.
[03:13:40.533 --> 03:13:41.594]  Because we didn't give up.
[03:13:41.594 --> 03:13:42.435]  Because you didn't give up.
[03:13:42.955 --> 03:13:44.656]  And because your audience continues to support you.
[03:13:44.656 --> 03:13:50.661]  So keep betting on humanity, keep betting on the Renaissance, keep betting on the New Enlightenment, keep betting on the Great Awakening.
[03:13:50.661 --> 03:14:02.790]  And you owe it to your kids to have hope, and you owe it to your kids, in my view, to fight for a better future and a better America, and to not give in to cynicism and the idea that good things never happen.
[03:14:02.790 --> 03:14:07.093]  And don't count on Biden or Donald Trump or DeSantis or anybody.
[03:14:07.093 --> 03:14:07.794]  Count on ourselves.
[03:14:08.294 --> 03:14:09.055]  Right, right.
[03:14:09.055 --> 03:14:12.277]  There's no one is going to come in on a white horse and save you.
[03:14:12.277 --> 03:14:13.358]  This is the delusion.
[03:14:13.358 --> 03:14:14.920]  And this is a way to get you to give up.
[03:14:14.920 --> 03:14:20.104]  Because if you hope on this one politician and he disappoints you, then you're going to think, oh, I couldn't have won to begin with.
[03:14:20.104 --> 03:14:22.466]  No, it was your premises that were wrong.
[03:14:22.466 --> 03:14:25.468]  You were hoping in the wrong direction and looking for hope.
[03:14:25.468 --> 03:14:26.449]  Not in Washington.
[03:14:26.449 --> 03:14:27.430]  Look for it in yourself.
[03:14:27.430 --> 03:14:30.032]  So what matters is issues and sticking with us.
[03:14:30.032 --> 03:14:30.832]  Yes.
[03:14:30.832 --> 03:14:35.076]  And realizing that people in Washington often get corrupted and co-opted by the system.
[03:14:35.416 --> 03:14:36.577]  There's no mechanism.
[03:14:36.577 --> 03:14:37.979]  It's even worse in Britain.
[03:14:37.979 --> 03:14:42.683]  The Tories there, the Conservative Party there, are even worse than the Republican Party here, if you can believe it.
[03:14:42.683 --> 03:14:45.566]  But the answer isn't via the Republican Party.
[03:14:45.566 --> 03:14:51.932]  The answer is to realize that Washington is the problem and to take power away from Washington, not give it from one gang to the other.
[03:14:51.932 --> 03:14:53.853]  And we're going to go shooting very soon.
[03:14:53.853 --> 03:14:54.794]  Yes, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[03:14:54.794 --> 03:14:56.136]  We're going to shoot up this William F. Buckley.
[03:14:58.140 --> 03:15:03.323]  Yes, and I did right between the eyes, although I wish nothing but goodwill for the Buckley family.
[03:15:03.323 --> 03:15:04.623]  I don't wish any harm on them, of course.
[03:15:04.623 --> 03:15:05.604]  But it's political.
[03:15:05.604 --> 03:15:05.944]  Yes.
[03:15:05.944 --> 03:15:07.265]  We're killing the idea.
[03:15:07.265 --> 03:15:08.846]  Yeah, killing the idea, right.
[03:15:08.846 --> 03:15:10.947]  Killing the idea of this Buckley type.
[03:15:10.947 --> 03:15:15.230]  Buckley's slogan for the National Review is, standing at the word history yelling stop.
[03:15:15.230 --> 03:15:16.871]  It is a slogan of impotence.
[03:15:16.871 --> 03:15:17.991]  I don't want to yell stop.
[03:15:17.991 --> 03:15:18.812]  I want to stop them.
[03:15:20.080 --> 03:15:20.761]  Beautifully said.
[03:15:20.761 --> 03:15:21.301]  All right.
[03:15:21.301 --> 03:15:22.342]  The White Pill.

[03:15:24.985 --> 03:15:26.266]  Thank you so much.
[03:15:26.266 --> 03:15:28.829]  The great Gerald Cilente takes over the next 45 minutes.
[03:15:28.829 --> 03:15:30.931]  Then, the great amazing
[03:15:31.773 --> 03:15:33.294]  Owen Troyer, 3 p.m.

[03:15:46.459 --> 03:15:47.279]  We believe in hope.
[03:15:47.279 --> 03:15:48.460]  We believe in the future.
[03:15:48.460 --> 03:15:49.660]  We're going to win together.
[03:15:49.660 --> 03:15:51.241]  Thank you so much for tuning in, folks.
[03:15:51.241 --> 03:15:53.542]  We'll archive this interview at Band.Video.
[03:15:58.004 --> 03:16:01.147]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:16:01.147 --> 03:16:03.448]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:16:03.448 --> 03:16:07.391]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:16:07.391 --> 03:16:16.318]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:16:16.318 --> 03:16:24.105]  And when we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:16:25.129 --> 03:16:28.752]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:16:28.752 --> 03:16:34.558]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:16:34.558 --> 03:16:37.600]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:16:37.600 --> 03:16:45.828]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:16:46.548 --> 03:16:50.829]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarstore.com.
[03:16:50.829 --> 03:16:55.770]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarstore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:16:55.770 --> 03:16:56.770]  Please take action now.
[03:16:56.770 --> 03:17:05.232]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars has proven itself in the last 28 years to be over the globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants.
[03:17:05.232 --> 03:17:10.693]  And we fund our operation with viewers and listeners' support while selling you great products at the same time.
[03:17:10.693 --> 03:17:11.313]  So on it.
[03:17:11.313 --> 03:17:15.034]  Thank all the viewers and listeners who have supported us over the years by spreading the word.
[03:17:15.674 --> 03:17:17.795]  I'm praying for the broadcast and buying product.
[03:17:17.795 --> 03:17:34.885]  But I really want to encourage those of you that have been on the fence, that have never actually gone to Infowarshore.com, to go there and get the great books and films and supplements and survival gear that's there, that won't just empower you and enrich your life, but again, will keep this broadcast transmitting.
[03:17:34.885 --> 03:17:44.811]  So whether it's Real Red Pill Plus, or our super high quality CBD oil, or the 50% off, or our great Fizzy Magnesium product, or whether it's Down and Out, our great Sleep Bae that's back in stock,
[03:17:45.151 --> 03:17:45.811]  It's all there.
[03:17:45.811 --> 03:17:47.652]  Our Turmeric 95% Humanoid.
[03:17:47.652 --> 03:17:49.393]  Strongest out there, Turmeric 95.
[03:17:49.393 --> 03:17:52.915]  It's all available at InfoWarsaw.com and it keeps us on the air.
[03:17:52.915 --> 03:17:55.857]  So make the decision to enrich your life and keep us on air.
[03:17:55.857 --> 03:17:56.557]  InfoWarsaw.com.
[03:17:58.965 --> 03:18:03.569]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023.
[03:18:03.569 --> 03:18:05.351]  And the world is an insane place.
[03:18:05.351 --> 03:18:07.093]  World War III has already started.
[03:18:07.093 --> 03:18:09.415]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[03:18:09.415 --> 03:18:10.576]  There's mass censorship.
[03:18:10.576 --> 03:18:12.778]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[03:18:12.778 --> 03:18:15.060]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[03:18:15.060 --> 03:18:19.444]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[03:18:19.684 --> 03:18:23.645]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[03:18:23.645 --> 03:18:32.048]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at Infowarshore.com.
[03:18:32.048 --> 03:18:40.711]  And whether it's a final signed copy, they're almost all sold out, or the great reset in the War for the World, or Ultimate Bone Broth finally back in stock after over two years, it's all available at Infowarshore.com.
[03:18:40.711 --> 03:18:42.312]  These are truly amazing products.

[03:18:58.644 --> 03:19:08.347]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[03:19:08.347 --> 03:19:12.029]  We can't stay on air without your help, and I want to thank you all for your past support.
[03:19:12.029 --> 03:19:18.971]  And I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products at InfoWarsStore.com to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[03:19:19.511 --> 03:19:23.774]  Ultimate Bone Broth, finally sold out for over two years, back in stock.

[03:19:28.778 --> 03:19:30.499]  Cardiovascular, critical.

[03:19:38.565 --> 03:19:47.491]  And the final 1,200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, and I'm not gonna sign anymore after that, are exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com as well.
[03:19:47.691 --> 03:19:50.113]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[03:19:50.113 --> 03:19:50.994]  We didn't have them for sale.
[03:19:50.994 --> 03:19:52.555]  But now, I signed the last books.
[03:19:52.555 --> 03:19:57.900]  You can get them right now.
[03:19:57.900 --> 03:20:03.786]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:17.758 --> 03:20:21.842]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:20:21.842 --> 03:20:34.692]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:20:34.692 --> 03:20:44.801]  You know, I was listening to that interview and going on back and forth with Michael Mallison and Alex and
[03:20:46.158 --> 03:20:47.779]  Look at the people that are running the show.
[03:20:47.779 --> 03:20:50.000]  You guys have been going on forever.
[03:20:50.000 --> 03:20:51.961]  It's a freak show.
[03:20:51.961 --> 03:21:00.246]  How could anybody, how could any man or woman, look up to the little clowns that are telling us what to do?
[03:21:00.246 --> 03:21:03.267]  Could you look up to a Lindsey Graham?
[03:21:03.267 --> 03:21:07.129]  A Mitch McConnell?
[03:21:07.129 --> 03:21:09.351]  That guy got more chins than Chinatown.
[03:21:09.351 --> 03:21:10.631]  What a clown.
[03:21:10.631 --> 03:21:11.592]  What an arrogant
[03:21:12.043 --> 03:21:12.783]  Arrogant!
[03:21:12.783 --> 03:21:13.523]  Arrogant!
[03:21:13.523 --> 03:21:14.344]  Arrogant!
[03:21:14.344 --> 03:21:15.864]  Stupid clown!
[03:21:15.864 --> 03:21:18.965]  Oh, and I don't want to be... Oh, they're repulsive, kids.
[03:21:18.965 --> 03:21:20.265]  I'm going after that.
[03:21:20.265 --> 03:21:22.346]  Hey, how about a little Chuckie Shuma?
[03:21:22.346 --> 03:21:28.228]  Yeah, I'll do Chuckie Shuma.
[03:21:28.228 --> 03:21:35.930]  Put my glasses down over my nose and really I'll be... Look at one little jerk after another telling us what to do.
[03:21:35.930 --> 03:21:38.611]  And not only in the United States.
[03:21:38.611 --> 03:21:39.731]  In a country near you.
[03:21:41.641 --> 03:21:48.625]  How about that little jerk they had over there playing the Prime Minister of the UK?
[03:21:48.625 --> 03:21:52.167]  Yeah, Boris Johnson.
[03:21:52.167 --> 03:21:59.872]  Our great artist for the Trends Journal magazine, Anthony Fried, if I said, listen, I want you to do a cartoon character.
[03:21:59.872 --> 03:22:03.734]  We're going to make this guy the Prime Minister of the UK.
[03:22:03.734 --> 03:22:10.778]  He could not have come up with a better illustration than the real illustration of that little lowlife freak.
[03:22:11.929 --> 03:22:17.415]  It's one little low-life freak telling us what to do.
[03:22:17.415 --> 03:22:19.256]  Adam Schiff.
[03:22:19.256 --> 03:22:20.678]  I can't spell it properly.
[03:22:20.678 --> 03:22:23.761]  You gotta put a T in there at the end.
[03:22:23.761 --> 03:22:25.403]  A little nothing.
[03:22:25.403 --> 03:22:27.244]  Gavin Newsom.
[03:22:27.244 --> 03:22:28.746]  Witless Whitmere.
[03:22:28.746 --> 03:22:32.890]  Hey, how about all you folks over there in Ohio, huh?
[03:22:32.890 --> 03:22:33.811]  Gettin' folked.
[03:22:35.854 --> 03:22:43.640]  How can you be so gutless?
[03:22:43.640 --> 03:22:47.503]  How can you be so stupid?
[03:22:47.503 --> 03:22:52.506]  Hey, I do what I'm told.
[03:22:52.506 --> 03:22:54.528]  I'm an American.
[03:22:54.528 --> 03:22:58.251]  And it's not only here, it's everywhere.
[03:22:58.251 --> 03:23:00.332]  I lost my... I used to go to Italy all the time.
[03:23:00.332 --> 03:23:03.334]  I used to date a woman there.
[03:23:03.334 --> 03:23:03.975]  Then I got a...
[03:23:04.611 --> 03:23:07.332]  I actually have a cousin, Vinnie.
[03:23:07.332 --> 03:23:09.193]  It's back and forth.
[03:23:09.193 --> 03:23:13.275]  And we're out one night, and they're all complaining about the bureaucracy.
[03:23:13.275 --> 03:23:17.057]  The bureaucracy in Italy is the worst.
[03:23:17.057 --> 03:23:19.679]  I said, what are you guys doing about it?
[03:23:19.679 --> 03:23:22.240]  What are we going to do?
[03:23:22.240 --> 03:23:24.281]  What are we going to do?
[03:23:24.281 --> 03:23:28.763]  And they were the first ones to lock down to follow the COVID war.
[03:23:28.763 --> 03:23:30.204]  We're following the COVID war.
[03:23:30.204 --> 03:23:32.285]  We're marching off to the COVID war.
[03:23:32.285 --> 03:23:32.345]  Yep.
[03:23:34.440 --> 03:23:37.582]  The average age of the people dying in Italy when they locked it down?
[03:23:37.582 --> 03:23:40.183]  81 years old.
[03:23:40.183 --> 03:23:42.225]  Of course, pre-existing comorbidities.
[03:23:42.225 --> 03:23:46.867]  And I want to make this clear to everyone listening.
[03:23:46.867 --> 03:23:51.210]  The Trends Journal Magazine.
[03:23:51.210 --> 03:24:03.517]  The only magazine in the world that gives you in-depth socioeconomic and geopolitical trends analysis and trend forecasts on the current events forming future trends.
[03:24:04.272 --> 03:24:12.697]  was the first magazine, the number one, to call the COVID war BS.
[03:24:12.697 --> 03:24:25.824]  It began, the COVID war was launched in 2020, January, in celebration of the Chinese Lunar New Year, the year of the rat!
[03:24:25.824 --> 03:24:27.385]  I'm not making that up!
[03:24:32.549 --> 03:24:35.690]  January 28th, Trends Journal, 2020.
[03:24:35.690 --> 03:24:38.370]  Coronavirus!
[03:24:38.370 --> 03:24:42.031]  106 dead in China.
[03:24:42.031 --> 03:24:47.012]  The next line was 1.4 billion still alive.
[03:24:47.012 --> 03:24:51.892]  What are you telling me this crap for?
[03:24:51.892 --> 03:24:56.653]  I used to be on Hong Kong TV back in 2019.
[03:24:56.653 --> 03:24:58.074]  I was on a lot.
[03:24:58.074 --> 03:24:59.654]  I'm on like 20 minutes.
[03:25:02.099 --> 03:25:11.921]  Hong Kong, a city of 7.5 million people, over a million were taking to the streets and protesting China taking over and robbing them of their freedom.
[03:25:11.921 --> 03:25:16.382]  They couldn't stand the Chinese.
[03:25:16.382 --> 03:25:20.303]  They weren't going to, and I'm taking a break, you know, I say, listen, Frank, what's going on?
[03:25:20.303 --> 03:25:23.164]  Are you people going to, Mr. Salenti, we're not going to stop.
[03:25:23.164 --> 03:25:23.984]  We're not going to stop.
[03:25:23.984 --> 03:25:26.965]  We're going to keep protesting.
[03:25:26.965 --> 03:25:27.405]  Guess what?
[03:25:28.314 --> 03:25:31.676]  Covid war comes, passes security law.
[03:25:31.676 --> 03:25:32.657]  Bonito.
[03:25:32.657 --> 03:25:36.820]  They took over.
[03:25:36.820 --> 03:25:39.662]  The Covid war.
[03:25:39.662 --> 03:25:41.243]  That's what they called it.
[03:25:41.243 --> 03:25:51.351]  So talking about the little freaks, the little lowlife scum in a country near you or a city or a state.
[03:25:51.351 --> 03:25:55.774]  I got a little clown boy over here that's the mayor of Kingston.
[03:25:55.774 --> 03:25:57.035]  A little nothing of a boy.
[03:25:57.805 --> 03:26:02.009]  Cut down the trees on the most historic four corners in front of my building.
[03:26:02.009 --> 03:26:03.591]  How come you're cutting it down?
[03:26:03.591 --> 03:26:06.053]  Oh, we don't want the, uh, we're paving the street.
[03:26:06.053 --> 03:26:08.476]  We don't want the truck to hit the branches.
[03:26:08.476 --> 03:26:09.497]  A little nothing.
[03:26:09.497 --> 03:26:11.719]  Clowns everywhere!
[03:26:11.719 --> 03:26:14.041]  They're politicians!
[03:26:14.041 --> 03:26:18.466]  They're low-life freaks who never work a day in their lives!
[03:26:21.912 --> 03:26:30.314]  The people I hated in high school and college that wanted to be class president by heading a student council, that's who's telling us what to do.
[03:26:30.314 --> 03:26:39.757]  So looking at the little low-life freaks who sold us the COVID war, you see the story coming out of the UK?
[03:26:39.757 --> 03:26:45.798]  Yep.
[03:26:45.798 --> 03:26:48.519]  Matt Hancock's plan
[03:26:49.306 --> 03:26:53.690]  To frighten the pants off everyone about COVID.
[03:26:53.690 --> 03:26:57.373]  This came out in the Telegraph over the weekend.
[03:26:57.373 --> 03:26:58.874]  Matt Hancock.
[03:26:58.874 --> 03:27:00.255]  You got it, boy.
[03:27:00.255 --> 03:27:05.199]  Hancock, the perfect name for this little... I can't say the word.
[03:27:05.199 --> 03:27:09.003]  I don't want to be, uh... Blackball.
[03:27:09.003 --> 03:27:12.285]  Hancock.
[03:27:12.285 --> 03:27:16.549]  Throughout the course of the pandemic, officials and ministers, this is the way they do it,
[03:27:17.091 --> 03:27:26.559]  Officials and ministers wrestled with how to ensure the public complied with ever-changing lockdown restrictions.
[03:27:26.559 --> 03:27:31.123]  One weapon in their arsenal was fear.
[03:27:31.123 --> 03:27:32.585]  Yeah.
[03:27:32.585 --> 03:27:34.426]  They called it the COVID war.
[03:27:34.426 --> 03:27:35.788]  We're fighting the war.
[03:27:35.788 --> 03:27:37.869]  Trump called it a war.
[03:27:37.869 --> 03:27:40.712]  Biden later called it a war.
[03:27:40.712 --> 03:27:42.073]  Freak Fauci.
[03:27:42.073 --> 03:27:43.995]  One after another, they called it a war.
[03:27:45.070 --> 03:27:49.673]  I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, a Yankee Doodle do or die.
[03:27:49.673 --> 03:27:53.956]  You march off the war, they get you with the war.
[03:27:53.956 --> 03:27:56.678]  Yep.
[03:27:56.678 --> 03:27:58.920]  And listen how they began this.
[03:27:58.920 --> 03:28:00.561]  Throughout the course of the pandemic.
[03:28:00.561 --> 03:28:01.762]  Oh, a pandemic?
[03:28:01.762 --> 03:28:09.167]  How many people do you know, how many people do you know personally that died from COVID?
[03:28:09.167 --> 03:28:13.170]  And if you did, how many of them had pre-existing comorbidities?
[03:28:14.614 --> 03:28:19.576]  Number two, throughout the course of the pandemic, officials and ministers.
[03:28:19.576 --> 03:28:20.896]  Officials?
[03:28:20.896 --> 03:28:24.118]  How about official pieces of crap?
[03:28:24.118 --> 03:28:26.158]  Minister?
[03:28:26.158 --> 03:28:27.079]  Amen.
[03:28:27.079 --> 03:28:28.459]  Hey women, minister.
[03:28:28.459 --> 03:28:30.140]  What minister?
[03:28:30.140 --> 03:28:32.000]  Oh, I don't pee or poo.
[03:28:32.000 --> 03:28:33.221]  I'm a minister.
[03:28:33.221 --> 03:28:38.363]  You're just a piece of crap.
[03:28:38.363 --> 03:28:38.503]  Yep.
[03:28:42.245 --> 03:28:44.666]  That's who's running and ruining our lives.
[03:28:44.666 --> 03:28:51.490]  If we don't stand up and unite for freedom, peace and justice, it's over.
[03:28:51.490 --> 03:28:53.330]  We're going to be right back.
[03:28:53.330 --> 03:28:54.191]  Support InfoWars.
[03:28:57.472 --> 03:28:59.432]  I've got some good news.
[03:28:59.432 --> 03:29:06.314]  Our high quality supplements really work and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[03:29:06.314 --> 03:29:07.134]  That's the good news.
[03:29:07.134 --> 03:29:08.274]  They're amazing.
[03:29:08.274 --> 03:29:16.455]  The bad news is around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to InfoWarshaw.com and ever actually buy the products.
[03:29:16.455 --> 03:29:19.896]  So you're missing out on these products plus it funds the InfoWar.
[03:29:19.896 --> 03:29:24.817]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[03:29:24.817 --> 03:29:25.657]  Think what would happen.
[03:29:26.577 --> 03:29:40.126]  If those of you on the fence actually went to InfoWarStore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects, so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[03:29:40.126 --> 03:29:49.092]  Also, we've got the super high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones, as well.

[03:29:57.397 --> 03:30:00.119]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[03:30:00.119 --> 03:30:05.001]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[03:30:05.001 --> 03:30:10.303]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.

[03:31:05.045 --> 03:31:10.370]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.

[03:31:59.693 --> 03:32:10.124]  I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[03:32:10.124 --> 03:32:14.449]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in
[03:32:18.450 --> 03:32:27.252]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to Infowarsstore.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[03:32:27.252 --> 03:32:30.313]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[03:32:30.313 --> 03:32:31.674]  That's great and I thank you.
[03:32:31.674 --> 03:32:33.194]  But we need funds to operate.
[03:32:33.194 --> 03:32:42.057]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil and our Fizzy Magnesium and our Sleep Aid and our Nitric Oxide and our Real Red Pill Plus.
[03:32:42.057 --> 03:32:43.537]  All of these are really great products.
[03:32:43.677 --> 03:32:44.177]  We're good to go.
[03:33:23.687 --> 03:33:30.232]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:30.232 --> 03:33:34.176]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[03:33:37.239 --> 03:33:39.800]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:39.800 --> 03:33:42.741]  Like Alex said, you know, support InfoWars.
[03:33:42.741 --> 03:33:49.544]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com and get what you can because you're helping yourself and you're helping InfoWars.
[03:33:49.544 --> 03:33:56.266]  So, uh, they got a lot of great products back in stock and they're restocking things like their prebiotic fiber.
[03:33:56.266 --> 03:33:59.888]  It's back 40% off, one deal after another.
[03:33:59.888 --> 03:34:03.629]  So do what you can to support InfoWars because they're supporting you.
[03:34:03.629 --> 03:34:06.110]  United we stand, divided we die, as I say.
[03:34:06.770 --> 03:34:11.532]  And if we don't unite and fight for peace and freedom, it's finished.
[03:34:11.532 --> 03:34:15.513]  You know, by the way, before I forget, I just did a great interview.
[03:34:15.513 --> 03:34:29.218]  If you go to Gerald Salenti or Trends Journal on YouTube, I did a great interview with Cy Hirsch this past Friday.
[03:34:29.218 --> 03:34:30.618]  And it's one not to be missed.
[03:34:30.618 --> 03:34:34.820]  And this is the guy that came out and said the United States bombed the North Stream Pipeline.
[03:34:35.925 --> 03:34:38.586]  That's not getting any mainstream media coverage.
[03:34:38.586 --> 03:34:45.428]  It's, it's very, it's, it's, it's one-of-a-kind interview because we went into, he's a real cat, this guy, you know.
[03:34:45.428 --> 03:34:50.929]  Pulitzer Prize winner, guy that came out and said, you know, the My Life Massacre, one after another.
[03:34:50.929 --> 03:34:52.730]  And he's a great guy.
[03:34:52.730 --> 03:34:55.850]  So if you go to the YouTube, you could see the interview.
[03:34:55.850 --> 03:35:00.052]  And Alex Jones said World War II has already begun, World War III has already begun.
[03:35:00.052 --> 03:35:05.113]  And that was the cover, by the way, of our Trends Journal magazine a year ago.
[03:35:06.109 --> 03:35:12.591]  February 22nd, 2020, two days before the Ukraine war began.
[03:35:12.591 --> 03:35:15.893]  We went from COVID war to Ukraine war to world war.
[03:35:15.893 --> 03:35:16.813]  It's already begun.
[03:35:16.813 --> 03:35:29.177]  So going back to this little guy, Matt Hancock, he goes, quote, we frightened the pants off everyone.
[03:35:29.177 --> 03:35:33.199]  These are WhatsApp that they got these all from.
[03:35:34.707 --> 03:35:41.692]  The then Health Secretary was not alone in his desire to scare the public into compliance.
[03:35:41.692 --> 03:35:43.192]  You got it?
[03:35:43.192 --> 03:35:44.593]  That's all they do.
[03:35:44.593 --> 03:35:48.676]  They scare you into compliance.
[03:35:48.676 --> 03:36:02.445]  And what kind of a man or woman are you if you comply to these little boys and girls who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag?
[03:36:03.923 --> 03:36:09.604]  Oh, they're tough when they got all their security guards around them!
[03:36:09.604 --> 03:36:16.306]  You call them out man-to-man, they wouldn't know whether, and I can't say the word what to do, but they fold like that.
[03:36:16.306 --> 03:36:18.506]  He goes on.
[03:36:18.506 --> 03:36:21.707]  The then Health Secretary, Health Secretary.
[03:36:21.707 --> 03:36:24.668]  This is a little arrogant boy.
[03:36:24.668 --> 03:36:26.108]  Stay home.
[03:36:26.108 --> 03:36:27.808]  Yep.
[03:36:27.808 --> 03:36:28.969]  Save lives.
[03:36:28.969 --> 03:36:30.089]  How about go...
[03:36:31.078 --> 03:36:32.699]  I can't say the words.
[03:36:32.699 --> 03:36:34.720]  Look at that little nothing!
[03:36:34.720 --> 03:36:37.742]  Look at that little nothing, arrogant boy!
[03:36:37.742 --> 03:36:38.743]  And he did it.
[03:36:38.743 --> 03:36:40.884]  He scared the pants.
[03:36:40.884 --> 03:36:43.646]  He scared the pants off everyone.
[03:36:43.646 --> 03:36:45.867]  I'm not making this up.
[03:36:45.867 --> 03:36:47.808]  What did the people do?
[03:36:47.808 --> 03:36:57.354]  The first thing when the COVID war came, they dropped their pants and went out and bought toilet paper.
[03:36:57.354 --> 03:36:58.615]  Yeah.
[03:36:58.615 --> 03:37:00.096]  You can't make that crap up.
[03:37:01.590 --> 03:37:02.411]  He's scared.
[03:37:02.411 --> 03:37:05.372]  They scared the pants off everybody.
[03:37:05.372 --> 03:37:12.496]  The first thing that the people did was run out and buy toilet paper.
[03:37:12.496 --> 03:37:16.379]  They scared the pants off them.
[03:37:16.379 --> 03:37:20.261]  If you wanted to make a science fiction movie up.
[03:37:20.261 --> 03:37:21.822]  Nah, come on, Salenti.
[03:37:21.822 --> 03:37:22.762]  We can't make this crap up.
[03:37:22.762 --> 03:37:25.004]  I'm not telling you it'll work.
[03:37:25.004 --> 03:37:26.524]  Nah, nah, nah.
[03:37:26.524 --> 03:37:28.325]  The people aren't that stupid.
[03:37:28.325 --> 03:37:29.826]  Oh, yes, they are.
[03:37:29.826 --> 03:37:30.827]  What's your favorite war?
[03:37:31.573 --> 03:37:35.116]  Hey, how about Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction?
[03:37:35.116 --> 03:37:36.477]  Why those dirty Russians?
[03:37:36.477 --> 03:37:38.158]  What could they did to Iraq?
[03:37:38.158 --> 03:37:40.480]  Lying that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.
[03:37:40.480 --> 03:37:43.002]  Well, that was the United States.
[03:37:43.002 --> 03:37:47.585]  Oh, and look what those Russians did to Vietnam with that lie about the Gulf of Tonkin.
[03:37:47.585 --> 03:37:49.026]  Oh, that was the United States.
[03:37:49.026 --> 03:37:50.287]  Yeah.
[03:37:50.287 --> 03:37:56.332]  Every day, every day, every day, every day during the Vietnam War, I used to wake up and they're going to get me.
[03:37:56.332 --> 03:37:58.293]  They're going to get me.
[03:37:58.293 --> 03:38:00.275]  I did everything I could to avoid the draft.
[03:38:02.157 --> 03:38:13.601]  And, and, as a young guy in my late teens and early twenties, I was too stupid to know it was a lie.
[03:38:13.601 --> 03:38:16.122]  I started learning as I grew up.
[03:38:16.122 --> 03:38:24.805]  The only reason I didn't want to go there, I'm watching these guys walking through water this high up to their chest with a gun over their head and about 50 pounds of weight on their back and getting shot at.
[03:38:24.805 --> 03:38:27.106]  I said, I don't want to do that.
[03:38:27.106 --> 03:38:29.486]  Lying us into war.
[03:38:29.486 --> 03:38:31.327]  And they lied us into the COVID war.
[03:38:36.559 --> 03:38:51.291]  Hancock's team engaged in a kind of, quote, public fear, in which they spoke of how to utilize, quote, fear and guilt to make the people obey.
[03:38:51.291 --> 03:38:54.113]  Yep!
[03:38:54.113 --> 03:38:57.376]  And they still do it.
[03:38:57.376 --> 03:38:58.817]  Fear.
[03:38:58.817 --> 03:38:59.398]  Lies.
[03:39:00.714 --> 03:39:09.841]  If we don't stop those Russians in Ukraine, before you know it, it's gonna be Europe.
[03:39:09.841 --> 03:39:11.482]  And then the whole world.
[03:39:11.482 --> 03:39:13.203]  Little Lindsey Graham!
[03:39:13.203 --> 03:39:22.951]  That was the crap shooting out of his mouth when he went to Ukraine with that other arrogant guy, Blumenthal, from Connecticut.
[03:39:24.016 --> 03:39:26.778]  Yeah, if we don't stop- Oh, Blumenthal!
[03:39:26.778 --> 03:39:28.819]  Arrogant lying Blumenthal!
[03:39:28.819 --> 03:39:30.219]  You said you fought in Vietnam.
[03:39:30.219 --> 03:39:32.081]  You're the same age as I am.
[03:39:32.081 --> 03:39:34.942]  No, what did you get, like four or five draft affirmants?
[03:39:34.942 --> 03:39:39.905]  Yeah, because you're a member of the club, you got in the National Guard, and you stayed in Washington, D.C.?
[03:39:39.905 --> 03:39:41.826]  Oh, that lying Blumenthal!
[03:39:41.826 --> 03:39:45.368]  How about blooming crap?
[03:39:45.368 --> 03:39:46.989]  And don't forget to vote for them!
[03:39:48.167 --> 03:39:55.832]  Anybody to me that votes the Repulsivekins, the Democratic Party, it's the same crap.
[03:39:55.832 --> 03:39:58.373]  We need a new third party.
[03:39:58.373 --> 03:40:07.419]  Going on to this Hancock guy, they go on to say, four days on January 10th,
[03:40:08.211 --> 03:40:19.581]  Hancock and Simon Case, the Cabinet Secretary, and therefore the country's most powerful civil servant, discussed more stringent measures that they could introduce.
[03:40:19.581 --> 03:40:33.673]  They agreed that minor adjustments such as banning angling would be paradigm galore, so they decided that, quote, fear and or guilt must be vital tools.
[03:40:35.452 --> 03:40:40.496]  They discussed making mask wearing mandatory in all settings.
[03:40:40.496 --> 03:40:41.817]  You know why?
[03:40:41.817 --> 03:40:45.260]  Because it had a very visible impact.
[03:40:45.260 --> 03:41:00.352]  These people should be at least put in, you know, and maybe the guillotines too much, but pretty close to.
[03:41:02.774 --> 03:41:10.020]  Every one of these arrogant clowns did exactly what this Hancock did!
[03:41:10.020 --> 03:41:10.941]  Every one of them!
[03:41:10.941 --> 03:41:11.881]  Oh, I forgot!
[03:41:11.881 --> 03:41:14.443]  I forgot arrogant Andy Cuomo!
[03:41:14.443 --> 03:41:22.349]  That the clowns in Hollywood gave an Emmy to because he could BS so good!
[03:41:22.349 --> 03:41:25.132]  He was better than Hancock!
[03:41:25.132 --> 03:41:26.933]  Yeah!
[03:41:26.933 --> 03:41:28.694]  And the people obeyed.
[03:41:28.694 --> 03:41:29.715]  And how they hate me!
[03:41:31.491 --> 03:41:36.895]  I had a peace and freedom rally over here when everything was locked down.
[03:41:36.895 --> 03:41:39.256]  Boy, do they hate me for doing that.
[03:41:39.256 --> 03:41:44.420]  Because all the gutless libtards, they all love it.
[03:41:44.420 --> 03:41:49.543]  They all love to be told what to do because they're not men and women.
[03:41:49.543 --> 03:41:54.327]  They're gutless little clowns, and that's who's running and ruining our life.
[03:41:54.327 --> 03:41:57.829]  A gutless little clown in a country near you.
[03:41:57.829 --> 03:41:59.850]  A Hancock.
[03:41:59.850 --> 03:42:00.611]  That's right.
[03:42:01.698 --> 03:42:03.579]  That's who's telling us what to do.
[03:42:03.579 --> 03:42:07.262]  This article is disgusting.
[03:42:07.262 --> 03:42:09.504]  Yep.
[03:42:09.504 --> 03:42:25.215]  This guy Case, the little clown, he was implicated in a Partygate scandal when he emerged that a party had been held in his private office as they're telling everybody to lock down and saying that they're spreading fear and hysteria.
[03:42:25.215 --> 03:42:28.538]  I'm mentioning this because they're doing the same thing with the COVID war.
[03:42:28.538 --> 03:42:30.139]  They're doing the same thing with the Ukraine war.
[03:42:31.553 --> 03:42:34.314]  And the people march off.
[03:42:34.314 --> 03:42:35.194]  I obey!
[03:42:35.194 --> 03:42:36.674]  I obey!
[03:42:36.674 --> 03:42:39.515]  Yeah, bend over.
[03:42:39.515 --> 03:42:41.115]  Obey.
[03:42:41.115 --> 03:42:42.795]  Be a good nobody.
[03:42:42.795 --> 03:42:44.176]  Be a dope.
[03:42:44.176 --> 03:42:45.456]  Be a jerk.
[03:42:45.456 --> 03:42:49.937]  Listen to the clown in a city-state country near you.
[03:42:49.937 --> 03:42:51.557]  Remember, support InfoWars.
[03:42:51.557 --> 03:42:54.038]  We're gonna take a break and we'll talk about the economy.
[03:42:54.038 --> 03:42:54.658]  Be right back.
[03:42:57.512 --> 03:43:05.694]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[03:43:05.694 --> 03:43:07.155]  That is a hellish future.
[03:43:07.155 --> 03:43:16.558]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarshore.com.
[03:43:16.558 --> 03:43:22.159]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:43:22.159 --> 03:43:24.140]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:43:24.720 --> 03:43:30.105]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowarsware.com.
[03:43:30.105 --> 03:43:34.049]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:43:34.049 --> 03:43:39.934]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:43:39.934 --> 03:43:42.036]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[03:43:42.737 --> 03:43:44.958]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:43:44.958 --> 03:43:46.898]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:43:46.898 --> 03:43:49.039]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:43:49.039 --> 03:43:53.060]  But when we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:44:13.078 --> 03:44:16.622]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:44:16.622 --> 03:44:23.509]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[03:44:23.509 --> 03:44:24.410]  It's really just incredible.
[03:44:25.419 --> 03:44:28.301]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:44:28.301 --> 03:44:34.867]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:44:34.867 --> 03:44:37.889]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:44:37.889 --> 03:44:46.836]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:44:46.836 --> 03:44:50.219]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:51.100 --> 03:44:56.092]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to m4shore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:44:56.092 --> 03:44:57.856]  Please take action now.
[03:44:57.856 --> 03:44:58.317]  Right now!
[03:44:59.403 --> 03:45:09.806]  I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to mfulworthstore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[03:45:09.806 --> 03:45:18.169]  I am humbly, hand-in-hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of you for years, and never gone to mfulworthstore.com.
[03:45:18.169 --> 03:45:26.652]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to mfulworthstore.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[03:45:26.952 --> 03:45:30.015]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[03:45:30.015 --> 03:45:31.396]  That's great, and I thank you.
[03:45:31.396 --> 03:45:32.917]  But we need funds to operate.
[03:45:32.917 --> 03:45:41.284]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our Fizzy Magnesium, and our Sleep Aid, and our Nitric Oxide, and our Real Red Pill.
[03:45:41.284 --> 03:45:44.247]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[03:45:44.247 --> 03:45:46.008]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[03:45:46.008 --> 03:45:54.916]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:45:58.931 --> 03:46:08.636]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[03:46:08.636 --> 03:46:12.317]  We can't stay on air without your help, and I want to thank you all for your past support.
[03:46:12.317 --> 03:46:19.241]  And I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products at InfoWarsTore.com to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[03:46:19.801 --> 03:46:24.064]  Ultimate Bone Broth, finally sold out for over two years, back in stock.
[03:46:24.064 --> 03:46:26.805]  Real Red Pill Plus, simply amazing.
[03:46:26.805 --> 03:46:29.067]  Nitric, boosts what it does for your heart.
[03:46:29.067 --> 03:46:30.788]  Cardiovascular, critical.
[03:46:30.788 --> 03:46:38.853]  All these products, like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Supermelt Vitality, they're all available and in stock, ready to ship to you, right now on InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:46:38.853 --> 03:46:47.778]  And the final 1,200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, and I'm not gonna sign anymore after that, are exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com as well.
[03:46:47.978 --> 03:46:50.421]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[03:46:50.421 --> 03:46:51.303]  We didn't have them for sale.
[03:46:51.303 --> 03:46:52.845]  But now, I signed the last books.
[03:46:52.845 --> 03:46:57.952]  You can get them right now.
[03:46:57.952 --> 03:47:03.860]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:19.131 --> 03:47:22.493]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:22.493 --> 03:47:28.955]  And now, your host, Gerald Sollente!
[03:47:28.955 --> 03:47:30.776]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:30.776 --> 03:47:34.358]  Yeah, there we are with Cy Hirsch.
[03:47:34.358 --> 03:47:36.799]  Yep, we've got the pipeline.
[03:47:36.799 --> 03:47:44.382]  So go to the Trends Journal on YouTube or Gerald Sollente, C-E-L-L-E-N-T-E channel.
[03:47:44.382 --> 03:47:45.643]  It's a great, great interview.
[03:47:45.643 --> 03:47:46.723]  He's a real man.
[03:47:46.723 --> 03:47:48.304]  A real old timer.
[03:47:49.403 --> 03:47:56.307]  So I just want to finish up with this, uh, with this, this Matt Hancock thing.
[03:47:56.307 --> 03:47:59.668]  And this guy, this other arrogant little clown.
[03:47:59.668 --> 03:48:03.270]  This, uh, this guy Case.
[03:48:03.270 --> 03:48:06.412]  Simon Case, the, uh, cabinet secretary.
[03:48:06.412 --> 03:48:06.712]  Yeah.
[03:48:06.712 --> 03:48:08.573]  Hey, could you empty out the cabinet?
[03:48:08.573 --> 03:48:12.035]  This cabinet.
[03:48:12.035 --> 03:48:12.675]  He goes, um,
[03:48:14.398 --> 03:48:19.979]  I tell you, the case was implicated in a Partygate scandal when it emerged that a party had been held in his private office.
[03:48:19.979 --> 03:48:21.160]  Blah, blah, blah.
[03:48:21.160 --> 03:48:27.621]  Colleagues are reportedly furious the case did not have to pay a penalty for lockdown-breaking parties.
[03:48:27.621 --> 03:48:29.882]  No, because they're better than we are!
[03:48:29.882 --> 03:48:31.542]  Don't you understand?
[03:48:31.542 --> 03:48:33.023]  They are above us!
[03:48:33.023 --> 03:48:37.464]  You do what they tell you to do!
[03:48:37.464 --> 03:48:41.845]  I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate!
[03:48:42.799 --> 03:48:47.600]  At 26 years old, I was on the other side.
[03:48:47.600 --> 03:48:58.103]  I know what arrogant little pieces of low-life, stupid crap these boys and girls are.
[03:48:58.103 --> 03:49:02.745]  They're nobodies, but boy, they got some attitude.
[03:49:02.745 --> 03:49:10.067]  Anyway, despite having to recuse himself from investigating them when it emerged that one gathering was held...
[03:49:11.089 --> 03:49:17.550]  The latest leaked message followed revelations last week that Case said, you ready?
[03:49:17.550 --> 03:49:24.791]  It was hilarious that travelers had to isolate upon return to the UK.
[03:49:24.791 --> 03:49:39.434]  On February 16th, 2021, after holidaymakers were forced to quarantine when returning from specific countries, Case said to Handcock, quote,
[03:49:40.419 --> 03:49:48.882]  Any idea how many people were locked up in hotels yesterday?
[03:49:48.882 --> 03:49:52.644]  Yep.
[03:49:52.644 --> 03:49:57.385]  Look at the stupid crap that they made up to rob us of our freedom.
[03:49:57.385 --> 03:49:59.866]  And it has destroyed this country.
[03:49:59.866 --> 03:50:01.027]  And the world.
[03:50:01.027 --> 03:50:05.068]  The damage done by the COVID war is incalculable.
[03:50:05.068 --> 03:50:06.249]  No more nightlife.
[03:50:06.249 --> 03:50:07.749]  Everybody goes home early now.
[03:50:07.749 --> 03:50:09.350]  Whole different world.
[03:50:10.478 --> 03:50:11.338]  Yep.
[03:50:11.338 --> 03:50:12.118]  There's a clown.
[03:50:12.118 --> 03:50:13.019]  Don't forget to vote.
[03:50:13.019 --> 03:50:14.279]  Look at that little jerk.
[03:50:14.279 --> 03:50:15.139]  Look at that!
[03:50:15.139 --> 03:50:15.919]  Arrogant!
[03:50:15.919 --> 03:50:22.561]  Oh, oh, by the way, he was caught, uh, having sex with somebody.
[03:50:22.561 --> 03:50:24.222]  Yeah.
[03:50:24.222 --> 03:50:27.503]  Yep.
[03:50:27.503 --> 03:50:30.103]  That's right.
[03:50:30.103 --> 03:50:33.764]  Another little clown of a nothing.
[03:50:33.764 --> 03:50:37.825]  Another clown of a nothing.
[03:50:37.825 --> 03:50:39.726]  Dr. Clive Dix the outgoing Tory.
[03:50:40.416 --> 03:50:54.982]  Said the outgoing Tory MP, meaning him, who resigned as Health Secretary after being caught breaking social distancing rules to pursue an affair with an aide, was quote, the most difficult of all the ministers, ministers.
[03:50:54.982 --> 03:50:56.822]  He didn't take time to understand anything.
[03:50:56.822 --> 03:51:04.625]  As Dr. Clive Dick said of Hancock, it was all over the place.
[03:51:04.625 --> 03:51:06.046]  A bit like a headless chicken.
[03:51:09.935 --> 03:51:18.842]  Earlier, the message revealed that Mr. Hancock took Gina Cola D'Angelo, who was having an affair with, to private dinners with the U.S.
[03:51:18.842 --> 03:51:21.404]  Health Secretary.
[03:51:21.404 --> 03:51:26.468]  Then altered a ministerial response to remove suggestions he invited her.
[03:51:26.468 --> 03:51:28.510]  Yep.
[03:51:28.510 --> 03:51:32.973]  All right.
[03:51:32.973 --> 03:51:36.396]  And I'm telling you, they're doing the same thing with the Ukraine war.
[03:51:37.185 --> 03:51:38.926]  Lying to us?
[03:51:38.926 --> 03:51:40.626]  Stealing our money?
[03:51:40.626 --> 03:51:42.647]  Oh, that Blinken, BS Blinken?
[03:51:42.647 --> 03:51:47.048]  Just another, what, half a million dollars went over to Ukraine to keep blooding the killing fields?
[03:51:47.048 --> 03:51:49.348]  That they say Russia's losing?
[03:51:49.348 --> 03:51:53.049]  And now that they're winning in this other area, they say, well, it really doesn't matter.
[03:51:53.049 --> 03:51:54.310]  Well, yeah, but you told me they were losing.
[03:51:54.310 --> 03:51:56.630]  Yeah, but it really doesn't matter that they're winning this.
[03:51:56.630 --> 03:51:58.151]  My name is Lloyd Austin.
[03:51:58.151 --> 03:52:02.592]  I used to work as the, on the board of directors of Raytheon, and now I'm the U.S.
[03:52:03.425 --> 03:52:05.025]  Secretary of Defense.
[03:52:05.025 --> 03:52:09.667]  I worked on the second largest defense contractor in the United States before Biden gave me this job.
[03:52:09.667 --> 03:52:11.507]  That's what he says.
[03:52:11.507 --> 03:52:12.367]  That doesn't matter.
[03:52:12.367 --> 03:52:14.248]  That don't mean anything.
[03:52:14.248 --> 03:52:16.248]  Yeah, but you were saying that the Ukrainians were going to win it.
[03:52:16.248 --> 03:52:19.029]  Nah, nah, that doesn't mean anything.
[03:52:19.029 --> 03:52:23.710]  All right, on to the economy.
[03:52:23.710 --> 03:52:25.911]  It's very simple.
[03:52:25.911 --> 03:52:31.512]  The higher interest rates go, the deeper this thing sinks, and it's going to sink deep and hard.
[03:52:32.972 --> 03:52:39.116]  Today, the Dow is up like 180 points.
[03:52:39.116 --> 03:52:43.159]  And now it's almost flat.
[03:52:43.159 --> 03:52:47.601]  We may be hitting March Madness.
[03:52:47.601 --> 03:52:54.926]  This is a time of year, October and March are two volatile months when crashes happen.
[03:52:54.926 --> 03:52:57.808]  You go back to our Trends Journal.
[03:52:58.809 --> 03:53:03.311]  When it used to be a quarterly, then it went to a monthly, and now it's a weekly.
[03:53:03.311 --> 03:53:07.652]  Last week's was over 170 pages, no ads.
[03:53:07.652 --> 03:53:16.516]  On October 1999, the headline was .com bust coming.
[03:53:16.516 --> 03:53:21.958]  And I had forecast that it was going to hit by the second quarter of 2000.
[03:53:21.958 --> 03:53:23.739]  And it did.
[03:53:23.739 --> 03:53:24.299]  In March.
[03:53:27.777 --> 03:53:34.500]  We are at that same precipice right now.
[03:53:34.500 --> 03:53:38.621]  Germany is that far away from recession.
[03:53:38.621 --> 03:53:42.502]  They just had negative GDP growth.
[03:53:42.502 --> 03:53:47.984]  The inflation numbers are well over 8%.
[03:53:47.984 --> 03:53:50.986]  It was supposed to come down.
[03:53:50.986 --> 03:53:56.568]  Everyone's calling it stagflation, a stagnant economy and rising inflation.
[03:53:56.568 --> 03:53:57.368]  No, it's not.
[03:53:58.698 --> 03:54:00.799]  It's dragflation.
[03:54:00.799 --> 03:54:09.965]  The economy is dragging down and inflation's going up.
[03:54:09.965 --> 03:54:21.153]  We are headed, as I say it, and we're forecasting, the worst socioeconomic collapse in modern history.
[03:54:21.153 --> 03:54:26.536]  This is going to be worse, worse than the Great Depression.
[03:54:30.154 --> 03:54:40.043]  And the Great Recession that happened in 2008 was the worst since the Great Depression.
[03:54:40.043 --> 03:54:53.735]  The Great Recession which we in the Trends Journal had forecast would happen in 2007, we took out the domain name, The Panic of 08 in November of 2007.
[03:54:59.554 --> 03:55:15.550]  When a little clown, an arrogant, arrogant, arrogant, arrogant, another clown that was the fed head at the time, Ben Bernanke, is that going to be a real estate problem?
[03:55:15.550 --> 03:55:17.411]  No, there's no, there's no problems going on.
[03:55:17.411 --> 03:55:18.192]  It's going to be fine.
[03:55:18.192 --> 03:55:23.097]  Oh, and how about the guy we got playing fed head now?
[03:55:23.097 --> 03:55:24.038]  Jerome Powell.
[03:55:24.961 --> 03:55:26.662]  Oh, there's no inflation, Salenti.
[03:55:26.662 --> 03:55:28.223]  You're full of baloney.
[03:55:28.223 --> 03:55:30.945]  It's only temporary.
[03:55:30.945 --> 03:55:32.406]  As it keeps going up.
[03:55:32.406 --> 03:55:35.648]  Well, it's just transitory.
[03:55:35.648 --> 03:55:38.910]  Now, of course, in the woke world, it's transgendatory.
[03:55:38.910 --> 03:55:42.853]  I'm gonna change the name of the Trans Journal to the Trans Journal.
[03:55:42.853 --> 03:55:47.035]  Oh, we'll do great.
[03:55:47.035 --> 03:55:48.196]  This thing is serious.
[03:55:48.196 --> 03:55:51.838]  I'm not telling you what to do.
[03:55:51.838 --> 03:55:52.359]  But to me,
[03:55:54.420 --> 03:55:56.642]  Goals number one.
[03:55:56.642 --> 03:55:59.925]  Treasuries, you're getting 4% plus interest.
[03:55:59.925 --> 03:56:01.326]  It's a safe bet.
[03:56:01.326 --> 03:56:05.250]  They're not going to let that fail.
[03:56:05.250 --> 03:56:10.194]  Again, I don't give financial advice.
[03:56:10.194 --> 03:56:12.336]  Prepare for the worst.
[03:56:12.336 --> 03:56:17.941]  You get all those products you could buy from Infowars, the store.
[03:56:17.941 --> 03:56:19.262]  You prepare for the worst.
[03:56:22.287 --> 03:56:28.670]  If the worst doesn't happen and you're prepared, you lose nothing.
[03:56:28.670 --> 03:56:35.514]  If the worst happens and you're not prepared, you lose everything.
[03:56:35.514 --> 03:56:43.178]  And InfoWars has a lot of great products there to help you prepare and also to keep you healthy.
[03:56:43.178 --> 03:56:45.700]  And you're supporting InfoWars.
[03:56:45.700 --> 03:56:51.743]  And again, if you want to know the geopolitical and socioeconomic
[03:56:52.412 --> 03:56:56.914]  Trends Analysis and Trend Forecast of what's going to happen, what's next and what to do.
[03:56:56.914 --> 03:56:59.415]  You want to subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[03:56:59.415 --> 03:57:01.415]  There's no magazine like it in the world.
[03:57:01.415 --> 03:57:03.416]  We're giving you everything we can.
[03:57:03.416 --> 03:57:06.037]  Because we see how bad things are.
[03:57:06.037 --> 03:57:11.579]  As Alex said, or we've said over a year ago, World War III has started.
[03:57:11.579 --> 03:57:13.940]  And it's up to us to change it.
[03:57:13.940 --> 03:57:17.121]  As I say, united we stand, divided we die.
[03:57:19.739 --> 03:57:21.400]  So do all you can.
[03:57:21.400 --> 03:57:32.269]  It does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen on setting breastfires of freedom in the minds of men, says Samuel Adams.
[03:57:32.269 --> 03:57:34.811]  And that's what we have to do now.
[03:57:34.811 --> 03:57:41.096]  Abide by the founding fathers, and one of them, no foreign entanglements.
[03:57:41.096 --> 03:57:44.419]  Thanks for tuning in, and we'll see you next week.
[03:57:46.749 --> 03:57:55.158]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars has proven itself the last 28 years to be over the globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants.
[03:57:55.158 --> 03:58:00.604]  And we fund our operation with viewers and listeners' support while selling you great products at the same time.
[03:58:00.604 --> 03:58:04.968]  So I want to thank all the viewers and listeners who have supported us over the years by spreading the word.
[03:58:05.669 --> 03:58:06.069]  We're good to go!
[03:58:28.291 --> 03:58:29.651]  This is their big move.
[03:58:29.651 --> 03:58:33.553]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[03:58:33.553 --> 03:58:34.093]  He doesn't care.
[03:58:58.308 --> 03:58:59.550]  That's not his job.
[03:58:59.550 --> 03:59:01.312]  He's not the President of the United States.
[03:59:01.312 --> 03:59:05.177]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[03:59:05.177 --> 03:59:09.682]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[03:59:09.682 --> 03:59:10.804]  They must be opposed.
[03:59:11.397 --> 03:59:14.839]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[03:59:14.839 --> 03:59:16.020]  No.
[03:59:16.020 --> 03:59:16.861]  No.
[03:59:16.861 --> 03:59:17.621]  No.
[03:59:17.621 --> 03:59:18.502]  Exactly.
[03:59:18.502 --> 03:59:22.084]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[03:59:22.084 --> 03:59:25.186]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[03:59:25.186 --> 03:59:27.668]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[03:59:27.668 --> 03:59:30.169]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[03:59:30.169 --> 03:59:33.772]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[03:59:33.772 --> 03:59:36.294]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[03:59:36.294 --> 03:59:36.714]  You're right.
[03:59:36.994 --> 03:59:41.737]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[03:59:41.737 --> 03:59:43.298]  And we say no to your war!
