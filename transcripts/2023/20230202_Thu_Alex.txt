[00:00:15.736 --> 00:00:30.748]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:30.748 --> 00:00:31.449]  It's Thursday.
[00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:51.286]  February 2nd, 2023, and we are going to clear the decks of guests today and take massive amounts of your phone calls on five big subjects I'm going to be announcing and covering in the first 30 minutes of the broadcast.
[00:00:51.286 --> 00:00:53.428]  It's all incredibly important, obviously.
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.781]  We have a Pentagon document that's been released.
[00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:02.402]  It's a public Pentagon plan to take over the brains of the American people.
[00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:05.722]  In cognitive security, you must be mind-controlled.
[00:01:05.722 --> 00:01:08.163]  To give you security, there must not be any freedom.
[00:01:08.163 --> 00:01:12.164]  Totally tyrannical, absolutely authoritarian, totalitarian.
[00:01:12.164 --> 00:01:13.444]  We're going to be hitting that.
[00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:16.225]  Putin is preparing massive assault with 500,000 men on two fronts.
[00:01:20.342 --> 00:01:28.530]  And it looks like it's going to happen sometime in the next three weeks, in or around the anniversary of the attack that was launched last year.
[00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.877]  I agree with that analysis and concur with that information.
[00:01:35.877 --> 00:01:37.919]  That's all coming up.
[00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:45.106]  We have the Great Reset, not just in Europe or Australia or the UK, but here, banning your fireplaces, banning your
[00:01:46.328 --> 00:01:46.668]  Yes, sir.
[00:02:09.107 --> 00:02:14.671]  We're talking to our friend David Azarad recently for an interview on Fox Nation, and the topic of Canada came up.
[00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:21.976]  David Azarad was born and raised in Montreal, but like a lot of ambitious and freedom-loving people, he fled later to the United States.
[00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:29.701]  And because all the people who care about their own rights have left, Canada under Justin Trudeau has become effectively a dictatorship.
[00:02:30.276 --> 00:02:31.317]  And we don't like dictatorships.
[00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.318]  We're America.
[00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:34.480]  We liberate dictatorships.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.882]  That's what we do.
[00:02:36.882 --> 00:02:40.766]  So we ask the obvious question, why don't we just liberate Canada?
[00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:43.148]  Here's that conversation.
[00:02:43.148 --> 00:02:50.475]  Why should we stand back and let our biggest trading partner, the country with which we share the longest border, and actually I could just say a great country.
[00:02:50.475 --> 00:02:50.975]  I love Canada.
[00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:52.437]  I've always loved Canada because of its natural beauty.
[00:02:53.442 --> 00:02:55.263]  Why should we let it become Cuba?
[00:02:55.263 --> 00:02:56.404]  Why don't we liberate?
[00:02:56.404 --> 00:02:59.606]  We're spending all this money to liberate Ukraine from the Russians.
[00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:02.588]  Why are we not sending an armed force north to liberate Canada from Trudeau?
[00:03:02.588 --> 00:03:04.069]  And I mean it.
[00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.993]  Well, I don't know that I'm there yet with you.
[00:03:09.993 --> 00:03:11.935]  I'm just talking to myself in a frenzy here.
[00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:20.139]  It's a fair question and honestly we thought the Canadians would be flattered because they're always flattered when you talk about them.
[00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.040]  They're like stalkers.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.024]  You don't know they exist but they've got pictures of you in their dorm room.
[00:03:25.024 --> 00:03:28.668]  So if you do a Canada joke on TV they go absolutely crazy.
[00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:33.155]  They don't really know how to handle it, or what it means, but it doesn't matter.
[00:03:33.155 --> 00:03:34.116]  They're excited.
[00:03:34.116 --> 00:03:37.779]  And that's true even in the Canadian Parliament.
[00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:44.967]  Apparently there's so little going on in Canada, like civil liberties, that if you tell a joke about Canada, they go bonkers.
[00:03:44.967 --> 00:03:50.433]  Watch this Canadian, quote, Member of Parliament, trying to get some kind of resolution passed condemning this show!
[00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:01.171]  Mr. Speaker, after consultation with the parties in the House, if you seek it, I believe you will find unanimous consent for the following motion.
[00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:16.454]  That given the rise of far-right and associated violent extremism led to the attempted insurrection in the United States, the House condemns recent comments made by Fox News personality Tucker Carlson in which he suggests U.S.
[00:04:16.454 --> 00:04:20.555]  armed forces liberate Canada from the current Prime Minister.
[00:04:22.743 --> 00:04:26.224]  All those opposed to the honourable member moving the motion will please say nay.
[00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:26.524]  Nay.

[00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:56.047]  There's something to think about.
[00:04:56.047 --> 00:04:57.768]  Settle down.
[00:04:57.768 --> 00:04:58.749]  Well, he jerked our chain.
[00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:03.551]  I just want to say about diet force.
[00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:05.412]  Diet force is amazing.
[00:05:05.412 --> 00:05:07.673]  I'm 45, and I have bits.
[00:05:07.673 --> 00:05:10.995]  I go to the gym, and I have bits that won't move.
[00:05:10.995 --> 00:05:15.137]  And diet force has helped me move those bits.
[00:05:15.137 --> 00:05:19.940]  Under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.141]  Man, if you're, like, struggling to get

[00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:28.321]  Diet Force is the go.
[00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:31.222]  You have to get the Diet Force and have it to a day.
[00:05:31.222 --> 00:05:32.862]  And just keep at it.

[00:06:40.357 --> 00:06:43.679]  It's Thursday, February 2nd.
[00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:46.421]  The year is 2023.
[00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:52.905]  And we are hurtling through deep space on this gorgeous planet into an unknown future.
[00:06:54.468 --> 00:06:56.350]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.292]  We're going to take calls for the entire broadcast today.
[00:06:59.292 --> 00:07:09.240]  The entire broadcast after I hit a lot of this news and then interspersed throughout your phone calls, I'll be covering breaking news and information.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.705]  Here's what we have for you, and there is quite a lot to say, the least.
[00:07:15.976 --> 00:07:25.172]  Incredible Stockholm Syndrome from people hurt by the poison shots trying to blame all their new illnesses on something else like the weather or
[00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:32.637]  Maybe perhaps the common cold's making enough of our heart attacks.
[00:07:32.637 --> 00:07:34.398]  We've got that big stack of news.
[00:07:34.398 --> 00:07:42.342]  We have Putin preparing a massive 500,000 plus troop invasion in or around the anniversary of the 24th of this month.
[00:07:42.342 --> 00:07:46.284]  We're going to get to that World War III looming information.
[00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:47.410]  I think?
[00:08:02.742 --> 00:08:11.447]  Disinformation campaign, and of course we'll break down who's programming that and what this campaign plans to do.
[00:08:11.447 --> 00:08:15.529]  We're already deep into it, but now they're going public with it.
[00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:16.750]  Also, Great Reset.
[00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.370]  Britain's faced 3,300
[00:08:20.472 --> 00:08:21.432]  I don't know.
[00:08:42.119 --> 00:08:49.804]  Christian mother is suing school for forcing four-year-old son to take part in gay pride parade and what that's all really tied into.
[00:08:49.804 --> 00:08:53.747]  Some very important free energy news that's breaking.
[00:08:53.747 --> 00:09:04.215]  Hunter Biden now claims laptop from hell was stolen and he's the victim and Democrats are saying they are looking to charge those that reported the Chinese espionage and pedophilia.
[00:09:05.015 --> 00:09:07.916]  That are on the laptop.
[00:09:07.916 --> 00:09:16.799]  Paul Joseph Watson breaks down so-called immigrants or invaders in the UK given free debit cards and housing.
[00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:26.082]  GOP representative Chip Roy exonerates Dems for refusing to condemn socialism and opposing the Pledge of Allegiance.
[00:09:26.082 --> 00:09:29.123]  We're going to be getting to that report.
[00:09:29.123 --> 00:09:30.163]  Jordan Peterson!
[00:09:31.505 --> 00:09:45.279]  Weighing in after meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu five weeks ago, having him on the show and having dinner with him, now wants to attack Iran and tells Americans get behind it, even though Jordan Peterson is not an American.
[00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:54.108]  Why don't you go try to get the Canadians to attack somebody and start World War III, Mr. Military Man?
[00:09:54.108 --> 00:09:54.989]  That's just some.
[00:09:56.451 --> 00:10:04.876]  Of what we're going to be breaking down today, a lot of news on the economy and more, but really the big news is I'm going to take a massive amount of your phone calls.
[00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:17.282]  We had a lot of incredible callers yesterday, and I intend to give the number out at the bottom of the hour to cover any of the subjects that I am raising here that I'm about to plow through right now.
[00:10:17.282 --> 00:10:20.764]  But first, let's talk about who to invade.
[00:10:20.764 --> 00:10:21.645]  Tucker Carlson
[00:10:23.263 --> 00:10:32.264]  On Monday, put out one of his Fox Nation podcast interviews and he was interviewing a guest and said, we're always going to invade countries.
[00:10:33.444 --> 00:10:39.549]  To liberate them, supposedly, why don't we invade Canada to liberate them?
[00:10:39.549 --> 00:10:40.369]  It was a joke.
[00:10:40.369 --> 00:10:41.370]  It was tongue-in-cheek.
[00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:52.519]  The Canadian Parliament's now calling for investigations and decrying the plan to invade Canada, even though it's the Chinese Communists that have basically taken it over and have 10,000 troops drilling there at any one time.
[00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:54.820]  But no, no, no, Tugger Carlson was planning that.
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.843]  But when we pull back, who's really supporting dictatorship?
[00:10:58.843 --> 00:11:00.024]  I've got clips right here.
[00:11:01.025 --> 00:11:17.633]  Of Democrats, like Hakeem Jeffries, opposing a congressional resolution condemning brutal and corrupt socialist dictators, some of them unelected, who undermine, he said it would undermine the House Democrats' agenda to criticize them.
[00:11:17.633 --> 00:11:24.417]  So obviously we're not really saying in vague Canada, we're pointing out, I'm pointing out, Tucker's pointing out, you're pointing out, that
[00:11:25.499 --> 00:11:40.208]  They are in a national emergency, that they're banning free speech, that they're banning demonstrations, that they're spying on their political opposition, that they're grabbing people's bank accounts, that they're doing everything that a totalitarian regime or a basic dictatorship would do.
[00:11:40.208 --> 00:11:44.651]  And remember, Justin Trudeau was elected.
[00:11:44.651 --> 00:11:46.212]  Jacinda Ardern was elected.
[00:11:47.142 --> 00:11:48.845]  Adolf Hitler was elected.
[00:11:48.845 --> 00:11:53.675]  Just because you're elected doesn't mean you then can't establish a dictatorship.
[00:11:53.675 --> 00:11:56.620]  Doesn't mean you can't even leave office, but leave a...
[00:11:57.881 --> 00:12:00.342]  Deep state, bureaucratic dictatorship in place.
[00:12:00.342 --> 00:12:01.983]  That's really what America has.
[00:12:01.983 --> 00:12:03.844]  That's why I raised this point.
[00:12:03.844 --> 00:12:05.484]  Canada needs liberating.
[00:12:05.484 --> 00:12:08.025]  The United States of America needs liberating.
[00:12:08.025 --> 00:12:11.026]  Scotland and Ireland and England need liberating.
[00:12:11.026 --> 00:12:13.227]  The UK is the only place under tyranny.
[00:12:13.227 --> 00:12:14.788]  Germany is under tyranny.
[00:12:14.788 --> 00:12:16.029]  France is under tyranny.
[00:12:16.029 --> 00:12:17.589]  The Netherlands are under tyranny.
[00:12:17.589 --> 00:12:26.093]  You can basically go to any Western country, Australia, New Zealand, you name it, and the leaders are on TV promoting classical, basic dictatorship.
[00:12:26.733 --> 00:12:33.738]  Do I need to play the clip of Trudeau again saying, I admire Xi Jinping and communist China, I want to be like their communist dictatorship?
[00:12:33.738 --> 00:12:41.824]  Do I need to play Jacinda Ardern and the rest of them saying, don't leave your house and if you don't take the shot, we're going to hunt you down and make you take it?
[00:12:41.824 --> 00:12:44.786]  You can't get more totalitarian, not just authoritarian.
[00:12:47.369 --> 00:12:51.392]  Than taking over people's bodies and trying to lock them in their houses and control their lives.
[00:12:51.392 --> 00:12:56.135]  But the Pentagon tells us what the next step is in locking us in our houses.
[00:12:56.135 --> 00:12:58.477]  The forced metaverse.
[00:12:58.477 --> 00:13:11.566]  So I'm going to tie all of this together, but here's the short clip of Tucker Carlson that's got the Canadian government having parliamentary meetings and parliamentary speeches and discussions about what to do of the looming threat.
[00:13:11.566 --> 00:13:16.870]  And obviously Tucker Carlson is a super smart, a genius, and what he did is baited them.
[00:13:17.702 --> 00:13:31.645]  Knowing that he would cause a bigger national debate about how the totalitarian regime, when he got elected again as the leader of Canada a few months ago last year, Trudeau was at a 30% approval rating and got about 30% of the vote.
[00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:34.525]  Now he's down to about 18% in national polls.
[00:13:34.525 --> 00:13:37.366]  Now you ask, how is he elected with 80% of the support?
[00:13:37.366 --> 00:13:38.166]  Or 30?
[00:13:38.166 --> 00:13:39.346]  Because it's the Parliament.
[00:13:39.346 --> 00:13:46.268]  So they can get different faxes of the Parliament to just give him a majority and still he wins even though in the popular vote he got
[00:13:47.129 --> 00:13:51.087]  Right around 30% of the vote for his party.
[00:13:52.987 --> 00:14:03.294]  All these people are disliked, they are reviled, they are hated by their populations, but for some reason we can't seem to get rid of them.
[00:14:03.294 --> 00:14:15.823]  Even if we get rid of them occasionally with a scandal, the permanent bureaucracy, the deep state, the permanent state, whatever you want to call it, that's what it is, is a bureaucracy celebrating that they can block what Trump wanted to do.
[00:14:15.823 --> 00:14:17.484]  They can block what Richard Nixon wanted to do.
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:23.423]  And they are at war with our rule of law and our country.
[00:14:23.423 --> 00:14:27.526]  So here's the short clip that's got everybody up in arms that I think really should spur a debate.
[00:14:27.526 --> 00:14:37.573]  Yes, we need to liberate our nations, but first you have to know who's in control of them, and you've got to figure out what you're going to replace it with, and you've got to figure out how to do it as peacefully as possible.
[00:14:37.573 --> 00:14:42.236]  But if we start winning peacefully, culturally, they're going to engage in election fraud.
[00:14:42.236 --> 00:14:43.717]  They're going to engage in censorship.
[00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.118]  They're going to engage in surveillance.
[00:14:45.118 --> 00:14:46.739]  They're going to engage in economic warfare.
[00:14:46.739 --> 00:14:47.900]  They're going to engage in intimidation.
[00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.490]  Which they've done.
[00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:55.613]  And then try to stage violent events to make their opposition look violent.
[00:14:55.613 --> 00:15:00.377]  As Mahatma Gandhi said, there are multiple stages of taking your country back.
[00:15:00.377 --> 00:15:01.838]  Of revolution.
[00:15:01.838 --> 00:15:03.619]  First they ignore you.
[00:15:04.656 --> 00:15:06.818]  Then they laugh at you.
[00:15:06.818 --> 00:15:09.461]  Then they try to outlaw and attack you.
[00:15:09.461 --> 00:15:10.101]  Then you win.
[00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:12.664]  And we're into the outlaw attack mode.
[00:15:12.664 --> 00:15:14.686]  Attack outlaw mode right now.
[00:15:14.686 --> 00:15:17.929]  So everybody getting freaked out and thinking, hey, we're in deep trouble.
[00:15:17.929 --> 00:15:18.610]  This is terrible.
[00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:19.951]  We've got total tyrants.
[00:15:19.951 --> 00:15:20.812]  The gloves are off.
[00:15:20.812 --> 00:15:21.833]  The mask is off.
[00:15:21.833 --> 00:15:23.355]  The gloves have been off for a long time.
[00:15:23.695 --> 00:15:25.356]  Now the mask is off, folks.
[00:15:25.356 --> 00:15:35.420]  And people can see that this is tyranny, corporately run by the big Fortune 100 that control the WEF and the UN that are bringing this tyranny to our shores.
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.902]  Here's a clip of Carlson going out to break.
[00:15:37.902 --> 00:15:45.285]  Why should we stand back and let our biggest trading partner, the country with which we share the longest border, and actually I could just say a great country.
[00:15:45.285 --> 00:15:45.705]  I love Canada.
[00:15:45.705 --> 00:15:47.166]  I've always loved Canada because of its natural beauty.
[00:15:48.186 --> 00:15:50.207]  Why should we let it become Cuba?
[00:15:50.207 --> 00:15:51.188]  Like, why don't we liberate it?
[00:15:51.188 --> 00:15:54.369]  We're spending all this money to liberate Ukraine from the Russians.
[00:15:54.369 --> 00:15:57.330]  Why are we not sending an armed force north to liberate Canada from Trudeau?
[00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:01.352]  And I mean it.
[00:16:01.352 --> 00:16:04.474]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:16:04.474 --> 00:16:06.795]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:16:06.795 --> 00:16:10.737]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:16:10.737 --> 00:16:14.659]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:16:16.095 --> 00:16:19.637]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:16:19.637 --> 00:16:26.421]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[00:16:26.421 --> 00:16:27.442]  It's really just incredible.
[00:16:28.453 --> 00:16:32.097]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:16:32.097 --> 00:16:37.902]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:16:37.902 --> 00:16:49.174]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it, but most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keep us on air.
[00:16:49.854 --> 00:16:54.157]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[00:16:54.157 --> 00:16:59.101]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsaw.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:00.142]  Please take action now.
[00:17:00.142 --> 00:17:01.823]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[00:17:01.823 --> 00:17:03.664]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[00:17:03.664 --> 00:17:11.770]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalists, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:12.510]  But ladies and gentlemen,
[00:17:13.487 --> 00:17:15.869]  I can't do it without your support.
[00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:20.452]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[00:17:20.452 --> 00:17:25.095]  The bad news is, the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not gonna back down.
[00:17:25.095 --> 00:17:27.116]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[00:17:27.116 --> 00:17:28.497]  So please, keep me on the field.
[00:17:28.937 --> 00:17:34.159]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.
[00:17:34.159 --> 00:17:45.602]  InfoWarsTore.com for the best supplements and more, or just make a straight donation, big red banner at the top of InfoWarsTore.com, and that way all the money goes towards the fight, not part of it going towards product cost.
[00:17:45.602 --> 00:17:47.103]  But I thank you all for your support.
[00:17:47.103 --> 00:17:51.524]  Please commit now to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get great products and make donations.
[00:17:51.524 --> 00:17:52.485]  I thank you for your support.
[00:17:52.485 --> 00:17:53.705]  Now take action.
[00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:56.446]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action.
[00:18:00.037 --> 00:18:12.552]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[00:18:15.347 --> 00:18:25.595]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[00:18:25.595 --> 00:18:37.423]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[00:18:37.423 --> 00:18:38.964]  This is why they attack us.
[00:18:39.444 --> 00:18:41.966]  This is why we need your support.
[00:18:41.966 --> 00:18:43.767]  Because we tell the truth.
[00:18:43.767 --> 00:18:45.968]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:18:45.968 --> 00:18:47.409]  Join the resistance.
[00:18:47.409 --> 00:18:48.709]  Buy products.
[00:18:48.709 --> 00:18:50.510]  Donate to the cause.
[00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:51.871]  Share the links.
[00:18:51.871 --> 00:18:54.293]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[00:18:54.293 --> 00:18:59.776]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[00:18:59.776 --> 00:19:03.018]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends.
[00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:07.300]  If we're so stupid we let them kill us, we deserve it.
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.641]  Except, children
[00:19:10.103 --> 00:19:12.885]  Don't deserve it, do they?
[00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:32.779]  And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[00:19:32.779 --> 00:19:36.762]  Another translation is, I looked, and behold, a pale horse,
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.563]  And his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him.
[00:19:42.563 --> 00:19:46.725]  The Book of Revelation.
[00:19:46.725 --> 00:19:48.386]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[00:19:48.386 --> 00:19:50.087]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[00:19:50.087 --> 00:19:51.689]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[00:19:51.689 --> 00:19:53.009]  This is our fight.
[00:19:53.009 --> 00:19:54.370]  And I'm proud of humanity.
[00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.831]  The globalists even admit it's leaked.
[00:19:55.831 --> 00:20:01.475]  They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[00:20:01.475 --> 00:20:07.379]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:11.649 --> 00:20:14.497]  I'm sick and tired of living in my world!
[00:20:42.597 --> 00:21:01.688]  Globalists think they're gonna win their revolution against humanity.
[00:21:01.688 --> 00:21:05.930]  But I can tell you, I have seen the future.
[00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.671]  And it's they who will be destroyed.
[00:21:12.421 --> 00:21:14.602]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's get into it.
[00:21:14.602 --> 00:21:19.265]  So, there's a big debate going on in Canada, a big debate going on here in the United States.
[00:21:19.265 --> 00:21:35.534]  It's happening in Congress, where the Republicans are coming out, the Patriot Caucus, the Liberty Caucus, and the Freedom Caucus, and they're saying, we want you to come out in resolutions against communism and totalitarianism and dictatorship.
[00:21:36.471 --> 00:21:47.358]  And the Democratic Party is defending it and saying it will undermine their agenda to come out and say we're not going to kill babies after they're born.
[00:21:47.358 --> 00:21:51.160]  Two weeks ago they voted no against that resolution.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:59.245]  Now this week they're voting against a resolution against dictatorship in the world.
[00:21:59.245 --> 00:22:04.408]  Remember Nancy Pelosi four years ago said that MS-13
[00:22:06.072 --> 00:22:10.654]  The per capita most violent gang in the world.
[00:22:10.654 --> 00:22:13.415]  They kill many of their victims in satanic rituals.
[00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:16.736]  They believe, give them demonic power.
[00:22:16.736 --> 00:22:20.677]  And Nancy Pelosi said, they are all God's children.
[00:22:20.677 --> 00:22:30.200]  And the Tucker Carlson says, if we're talking about regime change around the world, we've got a big Cuba north of us that has a man setting up a dictatorship up there.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:34.982]  They have parliamentary hearings where they admit he's continuing the emergency banning free speech.
[00:22:36.411 --> 00:22:38.672]  Shouldn't we talk about liberating Canada?
[00:22:38.672 --> 00:22:49.039]  And that is meant to spur a discussion of how we are going into an authoritarian slash totalitarian system.
[00:22:49.039 --> 00:23:00.806]  So here's a clip of Hakeem Jeffries opposing a resolution condemning brutal and corrupt socialist dictators.
[00:23:00.806 --> 00:23:05.789]  They're bringing to the floor of the House of Representatives today a resolution on socialism.
[00:23:07.165 --> 00:23:09.866]  Well, that's some good doublespeak!
[00:23:36.869 --> 00:23:40.270]  We're against dictators, but we're not going to condemn them.
[00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:45.152]  Here's Representative Chip Roy discussing this abomination.
[00:23:45.152 --> 00:24:02.337]  But, we are here, and I think this is important, again, this is going to be an amendment, maybe have like one or two minutes of debate, but now we're having a full-throated debate, because just like yesterday, in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives, when we offered a resolution saying that we stand to thwart socialism,
[00:24:03.308 --> 00:24:09.610]  There was complete opposition by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to standing a thwart socialism.
[00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:11.511]  Literally, a full debate.
[00:24:11.511 --> 00:24:16.653]  No, no, no, we cannot stand against socialism in the House Rules Committee.
[00:24:16.653 --> 00:24:18.213]  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle.
[00:24:18.213 --> 00:24:25.196]  So I just want the American people to understand, in the House Judiciary Committee, we have opposition to pledging allegiance to the flag of the United States.
[00:24:25.196 --> 00:24:30.718]  We have questions being raised about whether we should pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States and representing it as one nation under God.
[00:24:31.556 --> 00:24:40.560]  We have a Democratic Party that refuses to stand up and say that they oppose socialism and fought it in the House Rules Committee.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.381]  Presumably, we'll fight it on the House floor.
[00:24:42.381 --> 00:24:44.642]  We'll see how the vote plays out.
[00:24:44.642 --> 00:24:47.603]  And that is the state of your Democratic Party.
[00:24:49.096 --> 00:24:50.757]  That is the State of the Democratic Party today.
[00:24:50.757 --> 00:24:54.540]  The full breakdown and a bunch of the clips are on InfoWars.com.
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:25:00.704]  In an article, GOP Rep Chip Roy exposes Dems for refusing to condemn socialism and opposing Pledge of Allegiance.
[00:25:00.704 --> 00:25:03.325]  And folks, this is the debate we need to be having.
[00:25:03.325 --> 00:25:12.992]  We need to force this out in the open that multinational companies are promoting classical dictatorship and centralized authoritarian totalitarian control.
[00:25:13.868 --> 00:25:21.575]  We're trying to surveil us, ban our speech, cut off the money supply of people that don't go along with the system.
[00:25:21.575 --> 00:25:40.252]  A group of Catholic school, high school students wasn't just attacked outside, you know, a DC building a few years ago, famously, and the media claimed they attacked people, but now there's new video and new articles where a bunch of Catholic school kids, young people, go at the Smithsonian
[00:25:42.625 --> 00:25:51.073]  Museum in DC and were thrown out because they were wearing pro-life hats that said I'm pro-life on it.
[00:25:51.073 --> 00:25:58.119]  And the DC police are defending that saying you're not allowed to have a political message in here.
[00:25:58.119 --> 00:25:59.660]  What the hell does that mean?
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.042]  What do you think gay pride is?
[00:26:02.734 --> 00:26:04.755]  I don't care if you're gay or straight or what you are.
[00:26:04.755 --> 00:26:08.118]  I've never attacked anybody for that, as long as they're an adult.
[00:26:08.118 --> 00:26:12.220]  But you don't target our children with heterosexual, homosexual, or anything else.
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:18.565]  And you certainly don't have the gay pride movement worldwide being a transhumanist, globalist, New World Order thing.
[00:26:19.775 --> 00:26:24.058]  That the big corporations that own slave factories in China wrap themselves in.
[00:26:24.058 --> 00:26:38.428]  Oh, it's okay, we got slave labor in China and Tim Cook has the worst factories that he contracts with at Foxconn with 18-hour workdays and forced abortions and suicide nets because he's gay and he gives money to Black Lives Matter.
[00:26:38.428 --> 00:26:41.750]  They wrap themselves in Black Lives Matter and LGBTQXYZ crap.
[00:26:44.738 --> 00:26:56.131]  When nobody's opposing their life or what they're doing, they've got freedom, they're here, and then they want access to our children to tell them about sex, and then to attach it to everything else, and then have them parade them out.
[00:26:56.131 --> 00:27:04.981]  Right here where I live in Austin, in elementary and middle schools, little kids told, put these flags on, put these messages on, and then march around the streets without even telling their parents!
[00:27:06.277 --> 00:27:19.204]  If you were going to have my kids in a public school or a private school march for the Democratic Party or the Republican Party or for the environmentalism or for anything, you better tell me so I can keep them home if I don't agree with that.
[00:27:19.204 --> 00:27:33.392]  Plus, a school shouldn't be politicizing things, much less attaching it to sex, ladies and gentlemen, and their sexual future and transgenderism and confusing children about who they are when they're young and very impressionable.
[00:27:34.838 --> 00:27:41.082]  It's a big debate between parents when to teach their children about sex education and the birds and the bees.
[00:27:41.082 --> 00:27:51.049]  You certainly don't want strangers when they're five, six, seven years old with a globalist agenda teaching them, and we all know that, and it's creepy as hell.
[00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:54.811]  In fact, it made me so disturbed last week, like last Monday, I never aired it.
[00:27:54.811 --> 00:27:59.454]  And then I sent it to Owen on Friday and said, please air it, but I didn't watch the show.
[00:27:59.454 --> 00:28:01.536]  Will you guys pull up that video?
[00:28:02.697 --> 00:28:08.180]  Of the academics with the black doll, the little kids saying, is it a boy, is it a girl, trying to confuse them.
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.621]  And the kid goes, it's non-binary, and they go, good.
[00:28:10.621 --> 00:28:13.502]  Then the teachers brag, look how we're taking over their minds.
[00:28:13.502 --> 00:28:15.263]  Look how he said non-binary.
[00:28:15.263 --> 00:28:16.503]  It's working so well.
[00:28:16.503 --> 00:28:19.785]  I can show you the videos where they say, we're going to recruit your children.
[00:28:19.785 --> 00:28:21.185]  We're going to get your children.
[00:28:21.185 --> 00:28:24.167]  Again, if a man walked up to your eight-year-old daughter in a park,
[00:28:24.887 --> 00:28:39.200]  Well, you're sitting there playing volleyball, and she's over there, you know, eating potato chips or playing with her toys, and a man comes up and says, I want to talk to you, little boy, little girl, about your sexual preference and what you're going to be when you grow up.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.224]  That person would be lucky to not go to the hospital.
[00:28:43.224 --> 00:28:44.625]  And they'd probably get arrested.
[00:28:44.625 --> 00:28:47.708]  But if it's done academically, it's all cute and funny.
[00:28:47.708 --> 00:28:48.669]  They want control of your
[00:28:49.445 --> 00:28:53.749]  I want to form a sexual relationship with them to control them into the future.
[00:28:53.749 --> 00:28:55.191]  They will destroy their innocence.
[00:28:55.191 --> 00:29:03.760]  It's a cult of mind-controlling pedophiles.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:09.786]  Hey, what's up, Owen?
[00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:11.271]  Hey, McBreen!
[00:29:11.271 --> 00:29:13.292]  What's going on, man?
[00:29:13.292 --> 00:29:16.394]  Hey, really like that work you did on the AI piece.
[00:29:16.394 --> 00:29:18.035]  I'm going to use that on the show today.
[00:29:18.035 --> 00:29:18.935]  I worked hard on that.
[00:29:18.935 --> 00:29:24.699]  I'm working on another project, so I'm going to be up late again tonight, and I was hoping you had some Brain Force Plus.
[00:29:24.699 --> 00:29:30.002]  Oh, um, no.
[00:29:30.002 --> 00:29:31.463]  What about Brain Force Ultra?
[00:29:37.355 --> 00:29:38.777]  No.
[00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:39.558]  Hmm.
[00:29:39.558 --> 00:29:40.319]  Okay.
[00:29:40.319 --> 00:29:41.240]  Yeah.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:41.981]  Thanks anyway.
[00:29:41.981 --> 00:29:43.482]  Yeah.
[00:29:43.482 --> 00:29:48.348]  Good luck with that project, though.
[00:29:48.348 --> 00:29:54.456]  Get your Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra right now at infowarsstore.com.
[00:29:59.918 --> 00:30:06.322]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow InfoWarriors here in the United States and around the world.
[00:30:06.322 --> 00:30:10.945]  We are so excited to announce InfoWars MD.
[00:30:10.945 --> 00:30:13.747]  It turns out the top company in the U.S.
[00:30:13.747 --> 00:30:15.989]  for supplements is owned by a Patreon.
[00:30:15.989 --> 00:30:22.733]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting because they want to support InfoWars and keep us on the air.
[00:30:22.733 --> 00:30:26.116]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to market.
[00:30:26.756 --> 00:30:37.427]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands that are the highest rated under the InfoWars label, InfoWars MD, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:37.427 --> 00:30:42.673]  Check out the first of 10 new products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:42.673 --> 00:30:48.019]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's joint care, or whether it is super greens, we have them all.
[00:30:48.379 --> 00:30:50.481]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:30:50.481 --> 00:30:52.383]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[00:30:52.383 --> 00:30:53.344]  This is an information war.
[00:31:05.857 --> 00:31:10.542]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[00:31:10.542 --> 00:31:19.731]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that InfoWars has popularized.
[00:31:19.731 --> 00:31:22.994]  Because we understand the enemy's operations, and we know how to beat them.
[00:31:23.374 --> 00:31:24.976]  But we can't do it without funding.
[00:31:24.976 --> 00:31:30.643]  And we make it easy to fund with great products that empower you and your immune system and your family as well.

[00:31:34.588 --> 00:31:35.989]  A one-time, a recurring.
[00:31:35.989 --> 00:31:37.832]  But I'm asking you to take action.
[00:31:37.832 --> 00:31:38.653]  We're non-violent.
[00:31:39.053 --> 00:31:46.981]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[00:31:46.981 --> 00:31:49.323]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[00:31:49.323 --> 00:31:51.145]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[00:31:51.145 --> 00:31:52.286]  We're going over the top.
[00:31:52.286 --> 00:31:53.788]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[00:31:53.788 --> 00:31:56.811]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now!
[00:31:59.753 --> 00:32:01.754]  InfoWars has made history.
[00:32:01.754 --> 00:32:04.374]  You have made history by supporting InfoWars.
[00:32:04.374 --> 00:32:07.555]  The globalists are being defeated on every front.
[00:32:07.555 --> 00:32:11.016]  And now is the time to not just sit on our laurels because we're winning battles.
[00:32:11.016 --> 00:32:12.557]  Let's win the war.
[00:32:12.557 --> 00:32:14.317]  The information war.
[00:32:14.317 --> 00:32:16.298]  There's nothing you can do more important
[00:32:16.598 --> 00:32:16.918]  Thank you.
[00:32:46.678 --> 00:32:53.265]  If you want the coin, it's exclusively available right now for a limited time at 1776coin.com.
[00:32:53.265 --> 00:32:56.908]  $30 off when you use promo code 1776.
[00:32:56.908 --> 00:33:01.453]  Thank you for your support.
[00:33:01.453 --> 00:33:07.359]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.737 --> 00:33:24.342]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:24.342 --> 00:33:33.670]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:41.037]  So, we are in a culture war funded and controlled and designed by the biggest, most powerful companies and institutions in the world.
[00:33:42.088 --> 00:33:45.190]  Everything the left pushes is the establishment narrative.
[00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:46.751]  It is the power structure.
[00:33:46.751 --> 00:33:48.392]  It is the man.
[00:33:48.392 --> 00:33:50.253]  They are not anti-establishment.
[00:33:50.253 --> 00:34:00.901]  They are pro-transhumanist, corporate world government, destruction of the family, cutting off your energy, atomizing individuals where we can all be cut off and controlled.
[00:34:00.901 --> 00:34:05.464]  It is a predatory system.
[00:34:05.464 --> 00:34:07.285]  Mass Stockholm Syndrome strikes.
[00:34:10.345 --> 00:34:16.851]  As the masses continue bowing to the COVID cult and beyond.
[00:34:16.851 --> 00:34:20.895]  And I've got a bunch of examples of that I'm going to get to, then I'm going to give the number out and take your calls.
[00:34:20.895 --> 00:34:21.976]  But it all ties together.
[00:34:21.976 --> 00:34:23.177]  It's domestication.
[00:34:23.177 --> 00:34:24.098]  It's isolation.
[00:34:24.098 --> 00:34:26.000]  It's that you're not essential.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.225]  It is such a horrible nightmare system that they're bringing into play right now.
[00:34:31.225 --> 00:34:33.267]  So let's go ahead and start running through it.
[00:34:33.267 --> 00:34:34.128]  Since I mentioned this,
[00:34:35.413 --> 00:34:37.054]  Infowars wrote about this last Monday.
[00:34:37.054 --> 00:34:39.154]  I mentioned it but never got to it.
[00:34:39.154 --> 00:34:42.035]  This is North Carolina Education Association.
[00:34:42.035 --> 00:34:47.917]  This is what's taught to academics in public and private schools across North Carolina.
[00:34:47.917 --> 00:34:49.637]  This is Maddie Piper.
[00:34:49.637 --> 00:34:51.498]  And excuse me, I made a mistake.
[00:34:51.498 --> 00:34:54.939]  I said they're doing this to first graders and kindergartners.
[00:34:54.939 --> 00:34:56.239]  No, I'm sorry.
[00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:58.660]  This is in preschool.
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.741]  These children are three to five.
[00:35:02.159 --> 00:35:04.540]  And the doll is non-binary.
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.680]  It's not a boy or a girl.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.762]  So they learn that term and start thinking, maybe I'm not a boy or a girl.
[00:35:09.762 --> 00:35:15.184]  So they're slotted into the system to then be counseled and given sterolins and taken away from their parents.
[00:35:15.184 --> 00:35:18.105]  And then finally have their breasts and penises and testicles cut off.
[00:35:19.727 --> 00:35:30.893]  And the new comic book characters and the cartoon characters are all there making it fashionable to have your reproductive system destroyed and your biological system of X and Y chromosomes annihilated.
[00:35:30.893 --> 00:35:32.114]  So we're going to play this clip.
[00:35:32.114 --> 00:35:36.776]  Then I'm going to play a Mr. Rogers clip that's got the left up in arms.
[00:35:36.776 --> 00:35:39.198]  They're demanding the articles on Infowars.com.
[00:35:39.958 --> 00:35:47.944]  Let this coalition that Mr. Rogers shows be reviewed and that not be allowed to air if he calls people boys and girls.
[00:35:47.944 --> 00:35:54.890]  Just like Bill Guy, the science guy, we played the clip a few years ago of him in the 90s saying, you are X, you are Y, you are boy, you are girl.
[00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:58.052]  Those have been removed.
[00:35:58.052 --> 00:36:01.495]  And he supports those episodes never airing again.
[00:36:01.495 --> 00:36:07.580]  I mean, what a cult of controller.
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:08.881]  What a cult of control.
[00:36:10.902 --> 00:36:11.824]  Absolutely stunning.
[00:36:11.824 --> 00:36:13.448]  Here's the clip.
[00:36:13.448 --> 00:36:20.503]  Huckleberries, today I wanted to introduce you to a new friend in our class.
[00:36:22.253 --> 00:36:26.376]  Well this, Huckleberries, is my friend Nash.
[00:36:26.376 --> 00:36:28.737]  It's their first day in our class.
[00:36:28.737 --> 00:36:34.881]  They're just looking around at all of you, and they're so curious to know who you all are.
[00:36:34.881 --> 00:36:38.464]  Today, uh, was fun.
[00:36:38.464 --> 00:36:41.546]  It was really interesting though, knowing going in being like,
[00:36:42.924 --> 00:36:51.151]  I don't know what questions kiddos are going to have or what they're going to say, which is both nerve-wracking but also kind of exciting.
[00:36:51.151 --> 00:36:57.916]  It's that place of not knowing as a teacher and just being okay with that.
[00:36:57.916 --> 00:37:02.160]  And the friend likes to ask the question, are you a boy or a girl?
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.161]  Hit pause.
[00:37:04.482 --> 00:37:05.863]  Back up the clip ten seconds.
[00:37:05.863 --> 00:37:14.846]  Listen how creepy and snake-like this woman's voice is, so she can confuse children, put this in their minds, and then claim the children spontaneously believe it.
[00:37:14.846 --> 00:37:26.231]  They've had major academics and Biden cabinet officials come out and say, babies know they're non-binary or gay or straight at birth.
[00:37:26.231 --> 00:37:28.932]  They don't want children to have any chance to lead their own lives.
[00:37:28.932 --> 00:37:33.774]  It's a cult to destroy the individual free will.
[00:37:33.774 --> 00:37:34.174]  Continue.
[00:37:36.037 --> 00:37:37.098]  I'm just a kid.
[00:37:37.098 --> 00:37:43.383]  But kids can be boys or... They can be boys or girls.
[00:37:43.383 --> 00:37:47.986]  Or maybe non-binary.
[00:37:47.986 --> 00:37:51.529]  It was just like... Non-binary, yeah.
[00:37:51.529 --> 00:37:54.192]  That's just something that we know.
[00:37:54.192 --> 00:37:55.613]  This is something, I mean it's like...
[00:37:56.991 --> 00:38:01.974]  They're four and five years old and they just didn't make a big deal out of being a boy or girl.
[00:38:01.974 --> 00:38:09.778]  And I think it was a huge testament to how much we've been talking about it in the classroom that you never mentioned the term non-binary.
[00:38:09.778 --> 00:38:15.281]  It was a child who brought that up because it's constantly in conversation.
[00:38:15.281 --> 00:38:17.322]  Yeah, just like me.
[00:38:17.322 --> 00:38:21.624]  So Nash, just like me, is non-binary.
[00:38:21.624 --> 00:38:22.224]  So they
[00:38:24.713 --> 00:38:25.534]  Why does he like stars?
[00:38:25.534 --> 00:38:26.034]  They like stars.
[00:38:26.034 --> 00:38:26.394]  They like stars.
[00:38:49.677 --> 00:38:58.139]  They wore their star shirt because it's their favorite shirt and because they were nervous today they thought they would wear something that makes them feel special.
[00:38:58.139 --> 00:39:13.263]  So the government corporate funded North Carolina Educational Group comes in to the public preschool and she commends the teachers that we say it so much in the class to the three four and five year olds
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.162]  That they're saying it on their own, yay!
[00:39:17.162 --> 00:39:19.623]  We're effectively brainwashing little children.
[00:39:19.623 --> 00:39:29.591]  Little girls like, does the little person, the little it, that has no identity, that's not projected by the state and corporations, does it like stars?
[00:39:29.591 --> 00:39:33.854]  Oh, they like stars, not he or she!
[00:39:33.854 --> 00:39:39.738]  Diabolical, creepy, evil, dangerous to the max.
[00:39:39.738 --> 00:39:42.861]  Now, here is the clip that they're wanting removed.
[00:39:43.897 --> 00:39:48.160]  Uh, Mr. Rogers committing a thought crime.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.422]  Boys are boys from the beginning.
[00:39:51.422 --> 00:39:54.845]  If you were born a boy, you stay a boy.
[00:39:54.845 --> 00:39:58.547]  Girls are girls right from the start.
[00:39:58.547 --> 00:40:03.951]  If you were born a girl, you stay a girl and grow up to be a lady.
[00:40:03.951 --> 00:40:08.254]  Only girls can be the mommies.
[00:40:08.254 --> 00:40:11.176]  Only boys can be the daddies.
[00:40:13.593 --> 00:40:19.735]  Alright, and the word is that's being removed off the internet for being a thought crime.
[00:40:19.735 --> 00:40:23.136]  Folks, we're already way down the rat hole with these people.
[00:40:23.136 --> 00:40:27.257]  Now I've got a bunch of other examples of Stockholm Syndrome with the poison shot when we come back.
[00:40:27.257 --> 00:40:29.357]  And then I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[00:40:29.357 --> 00:40:30.918]  I'm going to give the number out right now.
[00:40:32.074 --> 00:40:39.580]  On mind control, on the war, on them cutting off the resources, on this anti-human attack.
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:45.505]  We can't just sit here and like, well I'll be politically correct, I'll leave it alone, I'll comply, I'll have a good social credit score.
[00:40:45.505 --> 00:40:48.087]  There's always going to be more, more, more, more, more they add.
[00:40:48.087 --> 00:40:49.808]  And maybe you don't care what they do to kids, some of you.
[00:40:50.646 --> 00:40:53.828]  New listeners, but do you care about losing your car?
[00:40:53.828 --> 00:40:57.189]  Losing your autonomy over your own body with these poison shots?
[00:40:57.189 --> 00:41:00.251]  Do you care about losing your stove or your fireplace?
[00:41:00.251 --> 00:41:03.152]  Because I've got all the articles around the world where that's being banned.
[00:41:03.152 --> 00:41:04.593]  Where is this coming from?
[00:41:04.593 --> 00:41:06.433]  The big mega-corporations.
[00:41:06.433 --> 00:41:07.494]  It's unified.
[00:41:07.494 --> 00:41:08.774]  It's the establishment.
[00:41:08.774 --> 00:41:09.475]  It's powerful.
[00:41:10.828 --> 00:41:13.029]  But we, the people, are 8 billion.
[00:41:13.029 --> 00:41:15.411]  And when we do little things together, it moves mountains.
[00:41:15.411 --> 00:41:26.077]  So if the listeners, the millions tuned in, will just tell their friends, family, strangers, neighbors about InfoWars.com forward slash showing man dot video and tell them to tell folks, tell them to tell folks, it changes the world.
[00:41:26.077 --> 00:41:27.597]  And if you'll just go to InfoWarsStore.com
[00:41:28.638 --> 00:41:33.703]  You'll get amazing products that keep this broadcast on the air that will enrich your life.
[00:41:33.703 --> 00:41:34.824]  That's called a win-win.
[00:41:34.824 --> 00:41:37.067]  Only way you don't win is not taking action.
[00:41:37.067 --> 00:41:38.308]  So take the action.
[00:41:38.308 --> 00:41:43.833]  Be part of the revolution against the establishment and their evil, neo-feudalistic transhumanism.
[00:41:44.474 --> 00:41:45.996]  Now this sale has to end on Monday.
[00:41:45.996 --> 00:41:47.457]  It'll be over Tuesday.
[00:41:47.457 --> 00:41:48.839]  It's the biggest sale we ever do.
[00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:50.821]  It's as big as our Christmas sale.
[00:41:50.821 --> 00:41:53.523]  And it is the Alex Jones is Right emergency sale.
[00:41:53.523 --> 00:41:58.709]  I had an hour-long marketing meetings this morning on what we got left and what we can sell and what we can do.
[00:41:58.709 --> 00:42:03.854]  So all this stuff's going to go back to regular price if it's not already sold out on Tuesday.
[00:42:03.854 --> 00:42:04.835]  Immune support.

[00:42:54.594 --> 00:42:56.855]  Now take action and fund the tip of the spear!
[00:43:01.348 --> 00:43:04.490]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:06.792]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:43:06.792 --> 00:43:10.714]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:43:10.714 --> 00:43:19.660]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:26.544]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[00:43:26.544 --> 00:43:27.445]  It's really just incredible.
[00:43:28.473 --> 00:43:31.355]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:43:31.355 --> 00:43:37.898]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:43:37.898 --> 00:43:38.838]  I know you spread the word.
[00:43:38.838 --> 00:43:39.759]  I know you pray for us.
[00:43:39.759 --> 00:43:40.359]  That's wonderful.
[00:43:40.359 --> 00:43:40.919]  Keep doing it.
[00:43:40.919 --> 00:43:47.983]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[00:43:47.983 --> 00:43:49.164]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[00:43:50.144 --> 00:43:53.425]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago,
[00:44:09.369 --> 00:44:12.931]  Rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[00:44:12.931 --> 00:44:16.913]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[00:44:16.913 --> 00:44:19.214]  And it's the same psy-op today.
[00:44:19.214 --> 00:44:23.636]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support.
[00:44:23.636 --> 00:44:26.078]  Because the facts that we've covered is coming true.
[00:44:26.798 --> 00:44:35.628]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[00:44:35.628 --> 00:44:41.295]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down Infowars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[00:44:41.795 --> 00:44:43.736]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[00:44:43.736 --> 00:44:51.019]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[00:44:51.019 --> 00:44:52.419]  It is all in your hands.
[00:44:52.419 --> 00:44:53.760]  So thanks for your support.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.960]  Stand up against the globalists.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.242]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and keep us on air.
[00:44:58.242 --> 00:44:58.722]  It's up to you.
[00:45:00.242 --> 00:45:12.940]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:16.265]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[00:45:16.906 --> 00:45:19.207]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[00:45:19.207 --> 00:45:26.771]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support, and because of the facts that we've covered is coming true.
[00:45:26.771 --> 00:45:35.595]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[00:45:35.595 --> 00:45:41.278]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[00:45:41.778 --> 00:45:43.719]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[00:45:43.719 --> 00:45:50.982]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[00:45:50.982 --> 00:45:52.402]  It is all in your hands.
[00:45:52.402 --> 00:45:53.743]  So thanks for your support.
[00:45:53.743 --> 00:45:54.943]  Stand up against the globalists.
[00:45:54.943 --> 00:45:58.225]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and keep us on air.
[00:45:58.225 --> 00:45:58.705]  It's up to you.
[00:46:00.347 --> 00:46:04.870]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars MD.
[00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:17.337]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[00:46:17.337 --> 00:46:18.517]  These are high-end.
[00:46:18.517 --> 00:46:19.578]  These are the very best.
[00:46:19.898 --> 00:46:22.380]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:22.901]  Well, guess what?
[00:46:22.901 --> 00:46:28.687]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[00:46:28.687 --> 00:46:31.329]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[00:46:31.329 --> 00:46:38.196]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality, full-spectrum CBD.
[00:46:38.196 --> 00:46:43.421]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:43.421 --> 00:46:44.382]  The highest quality.
[00:46:44.662 --> 00:46:53.449]  Directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50% in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[00:46:53.449 --> 00:47:01.596]  M4 Wars MD at m4warsstore.com.
[00:47:01.596 --> 00:47:07.501]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:14.005 --> 00:47:16.446]  So it's critical to meet this mind control.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:48.205]  To understand that 99% of people that go along with the power structure are followers and are under mass Stockholm Syndrome and learned helplessness and have been positioned to not be able to understand they're being abused and can't ever admit that they're being abused.
[00:47:48.205 --> 00:47:50.025]  There's countless examples of this.
[00:47:50.025 --> 00:47:56.767]  The clips you see everywhere of people saying, well, I took the first shot and my face and arms were paralyzed for two weeks.
[00:47:57.785 --> 00:48:01.046]  And now I have red bloody spots all over me, but I'm taking the second one.
[00:48:01.046 --> 00:48:01.986]  I'm gonna be safe!
[00:48:01.986 --> 00:48:03.887]  I'm gonna do it!
[00:48:03.887 --> 00:48:06.548]  And you see those videos, you think, this has gotta be fake.
[00:48:06.548 --> 00:48:08.829]  And then it turns out they're real.
[00:48:08.829 --> 00:48:12.410]  So, it's easy to laugh at these people, but it's not funny.
[00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:14.090]  Because they're dangerous.
[00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:21.453]  And they're gonna try to go along with forcing us to live in their hell with them, because they're told, oh, Utopia's always right over the hill, right around the next corner.
[00:48:22.401 --> 00:48:27.004]  We just can't get these bad people to listen to us and believe us.
[00:48:27.004 --> 00:48:28.425]  If we could just have World War III.
[00:48:28.425 --> 00:48:30.947]  I mean, Sean Penn said, hey, nuclear war is not that bad.
[00:48:30.947 --> 00:48:31.768]  Really.
[00:48:31.768 --> 00:48:32.748]  We can do it.
[00:48:32.748 --> 00:48:34.389]  Can't be off the table.
[00:48:34.389 --> 00:48:35.930]  Come on, nuclear war, folks.
[00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:37.972]  Hey, forced injections and experimental shots.
[00:48:37.972 --> 00:48:38.612]  Come on.
[00:48:38.612 --> 00:48:40.914]  Convicted pedophiles having access to your kids.
[00:48:40.914 --> 00:48:41.594]  Open borders.
[00:48:41.594 --> 00:48:42.655]  Fentanyl.
[00:48:42.655 --> 00:48:43.676]  Devaluing the currency.
[00:48:45.222 --> 00:48:49.246]  Cutting off our energy, but not cutting off China's and others, where the globalists invest.
[00:48:49.246 --> 00:48:49.867]  No, no, no.
[00:48:49.867 --> 00:48:51.269]  It's all for your own good.
[00:48:51.269 --> 00:48:52.790]  Show how moral you are.
[00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:57.676]  We'll pat you on the head and reward you psychologically.
[00:48:57.676 --> 00:49:00.058]  Maybe give you some free tickets to a baseball game.
[00:49:00.058 --> 00:49:01.099]  If you take the injections.
[00:49:01.099 --> 00:49:01.920]  Maybe a hamburger.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.342]  Maybe some french fries.
[00:49:03.342 --> 00:49:05.965]  You mean you get delicious fries with a delicious burger?
[00:49:07.355 --> 00:49:19.570]  So here he is, fully vaccinated, MSNBC host, Yasmin Vazagayan, develops pancreatitis, and then myocarditis, then blames the condition on the common cold.
[00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:22.053]  Or, you know, it's stroke season too now.
[00:49:22.053 --> 00:49:22.553]  Here she is.
[00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:27.613]  I was pretty certain not to believe the reflux.
[00:49:27.613 --> 00:49:35.819]  The next day, on December 30th, I woke up with severe pains both in my chest and in my left shoulder, and it was like a tightening in my chest.
[00:49:35.819 --> 00:49:36.980]  I took deep breaths.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:39.702]  That got worse when I was laying flat.
[00:49:39.702 --> 00:49:47.508]  I knew enough at that moment to understand that it could mean, could is the key word here, that I was having a heart attack, especially because it was happening in the left part of my shoulder.
[00:49:48.228 --> 00:49:51.930]  I want to remind you, I run seven miles three to four times a week, or I did.
[00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:53.871]  I do yoga.
[00:49:53.871 --> 00:49:54.591]  I don't eat meat.
[00:49:54.591 --> 00:49:55.912]  I don't smoke.
[00:49:55.912 --> 00:49:56.793]  I drink occasionally.
[00:49:56.793 --> 00:49:59.634]  Not right now, though, because my doctor tells me I can't.
[00:49:59.634 --> 00:50:03.616]  Aside from probably not getting enough sleep and working too much, I'm a pretty healthy person.
[00:50:03.616 --> 00:50:06.038]  But on that day, I was anything but.
[00:50:06.778 --> 00:50:11.182]  My husband drove me to the emergency room and from there the nightmare that has been my January began.
[00:50:11.182 --> 00:50:18.048]  I was diagnosed with pericarditis, inflammation of the lining of my heart brought on by a virus.
[00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:20.890]  A literal common cold.
[00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:26.495]  I also had fluid around my heart that had to be drained or else it could hinder the beating of my heart.
[00:50:26.495 --> 00:50:32.340]  I was hospitalized for four nights and transferred from a local hospital to NYU Langone here in New York City.
[00:50:33.081 --> 00:50:38.443]  On January 4th, I was finally discharged after doctors drained the fluid around my heart, and I bounced out of the hospital.
[00:50:38.443 --> 00:50:39.643]  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.
[00:50:39.643 --> 00:50:42.365]  With the hopes, I was on the mend.
[00:50:42.365 --> 00:50:43.805]  But that was not the end.
[00:50:43.805 --> 00:50:48.967]  Three days later, I was readmitted when I felt a flutter in my heart, like a butterfly.
[00:50:48.967 --> 00:50:50.287]  It was inside my chest.
[00:50:50.287 --> 00:50:58.851]  They determined I had developed myocarditis, inflammation of the actual heart now, the heart muscle.
[00:50:58.851 --> 00:51:01.832]  I remember being shepherded through the emergency room and wondering, is this it?
[00:51:02.995 --> 00:51:04.696]  It wasn't, thank God.
[00:51:04.696 --> 00:51:16.283]  Instead, I spent five more days in the hospital where they ran a battery of tests, adjusted my meds, and made sure nothing else was... Okay, so that's Yasmin Vesuvium develops pericarditis.
[00:51:17.429 --> 00:51:35.000]  And then myocarditis, which is exactly what the document in October 2000 from the CDC predicted these mRNA shots would do, because they tested a similar shot on rats at the University of Texas under a program run by Obama and Fauci.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:41.924]  But no, she says it's the common cold, and it's just normal that you're all going to have major heart problems now.
[00:51:41.924 --> 00:51:43.525]  And she'll take more shots till she dies!
[00:51:45.359 --> 00:51:52.883]  And her family, I guess, will never come to grips with it because they can't admit it's being done to them.
[00:51:52.883 --> 00:52:02.268]  Here's another example of Colbert really laughing at his audience, who he knows will never take their mask off, but saying, hey, great news.
[00:52:02.268 --> 00:52:08.952]  Biden is saying it will be over in the summer, just a few more months, and then Biden will lift the emergency.
[00:52:11.291 --> 00:52:12.811]  Here's Colbert.
[00:52:12.811 --> 00:52:20.673]  Tonight, breathing easy, because the White House has finally announced they plan to end the COVID public health emergency in May.
[00:52:20.673 --> 00:52:21.993]  Take that, COVID!
[00:52:21.993 --> 00:52:23.233]  We beat you!
[00:52:23.233 --> 00:52:27.134]  Shove that up your nose and rotate it five times.
[00:52:27.134 --> 00:52:29.214]  This has been a long time coming.
[00:52:29.214 --> 00:52:32.195]  I wish you could see the smiles on the faces of my audience.
[00:52:32.195 --> 00:52:38.096]  And I wish I could, too, because they're still wearing masks.
[00:52:38.096 --> 00:52:39.136]  The end is near!
[00:52:40.777 --> 00:52:41.998]  The end is near.
[00:52:41.998 --> 00:52:43.520]  This is a huge moment.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:47.623]  After all the COVID, we've all been through the Delta variant.
[00:52:47.623 --> 00:52:57.332]  Omicron, Omicron VA2, XBB.1.5, Z95, the homoclassic.
[00:52:57.332 --> 00:53:00.075]  So there he is laughing at them as they all cheer.
[00:53:00.075 --> 00:53:01.556]  We're still wearing our masks!
[00:53:01.556 --> 00:53:03.038]  Yay!
[00:53:03.038 --> 00:53:06.181]  Even though what we told you two and a half years ago is now confirmed by another
[00:53:07.281 --> 00:53:08.782]  Major study.
[00:53:08.782 --> 00:53:28.582]  Massive peer-reviewed mass study shows little to no difference in preventing COVID and flu infection with the mask, and of course, increase of bacterial pneumonia that breed in the mask, and you don't get as much of the natural flora that's out there, so your body lowers its immunity while you wear a mask as well.
[00:53:30.822 --> 00:53:44.966]  A massive international research collaboration that analyzed several dozen rigorous studies focusing on physical interventions against COVID-19 influenza found that they provide little to no protection against infection or illness rates.
[00:53:44.966 --> 00:53:51.348]  But don't worry, that's at least better than the shots that lower your immunity and increase infection, hospitalization, and death.
[00:53:51.348 --> 00:53:54.348]  But those under Stockholm Syndrome don't care.
[00:53:54.348 --> 00:53:56.309]  It's their security blanket.
[00:53:57.335 --> 00:54:02.076]  Bills provide for imprisonment for those who doubt vaccines in Brazil.
[00:54:02.076 --> 00:54:03.697]  And guess who it's sponsored by?
[00:54:03.697 --> 00:54:06.377]  Guess who's funding the politicians?
[00:54:06.377 --> 00:54:09.158]  That's right, Pfizer and others.
[00:54:09.158 --> 00:54:15.460]  They don't want you to be able to speak out against what they're assaulting us with.
[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:19.861]  FDA advisor inadvertently confirms Pfizer is doing gain-of-function research.
[00:54:19.861 --> 00:54:22.762]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:22.762 --> 00:54:23.702]  And it goes on.
[00:54:25.586 --> 00:54:29.993]  And on from there, what a time to be alive.
[00:54:29.993 --> 00:54:32.297]  I want to give the number out.
[00:54:32.297 --> 00:54:34.781]  I'm going to take a ton of calls today.
[00:54:34.781 --> 00:54:37.926]  I've already raised the issue of mass Stockholm syndrome mind control.
[00:54:37.926 --> 00:54:39.288]  How do we get people out of it?
[00:54:40.404 --> 00:54:41.645]  We're going to start the next hour.
[00:54:41.645 --> 00:54:43.587]  I'm going to cover the big mind control news.
[00:54:43.587 --> 00:54:47.070]  I just set the table so far, and then we're going right to your calls.
[00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:54.397]  It's going to take me about 10 minutes to cover these stacks right here that are so critical, and who's behind the mind control, and then we'll go to your phone calls.
[00:54:54.397 --> 00:54:56.379]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:54:56.379 --> 00:54:56.699]  There it is.
[00:55:01.203 --> 00:55:01.603]  1-877-789-2539.
[00:55:01.603 --> 00:55:12.935]  Remember the old cartoons when you were a kid, the black and white ones, if you're old enough to remember those, where it followed the bouncing ball, taught kids how to read.
[00:55:12.935 --> 00:55:15.777]  I can read by the time I was five pretty good because of those cartoons.
[00:55:15.777 --> 00:55:17.559]  They don't have those now, so I don't want you to know how to read.
[00:55:17.559 --> 00:55:17.619]  1-877-789-2539.
[00:55:25.587 --> 00:55:29.650]  2-5-3-9 and we are taking your phone calls.
[00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:33.273]  You know, back then when they had black and white cartoons teaching kids how to write?
[00:55:33.273 --> 00:55:35.455]  Teaching kids how to read?
[00:55:35.455 --> 00:55:41.319]  They also put iodine in the salt and it raised IQs on average in the U.S.
[00:55:41.319 --> 00:55:46.303]  within a decade once they started in the late 20s by 15 points!
[00:55:46.303 --> 00:55:51.807]  Oh, but the government made sure it got taken out in the late 70s with new policies of Henry Kissinger.
[00:55:52.694 --> 00:56:00.506]  We want to adulterate the food and water to lower IQs to make them more manageable, and we want to wipe out at least 80% of the world's population.
[00:56:00.506 --> 00:56:01.929]  Now, they haven't gotten around to that.
[00:56:01.929 --> 00:56:05.093]  They've slowed the rate, but that's where we're all living.
[00:56:05.093 --> 00:56:06.636]  That's what we're all under.
[00:56:06.636 --> 00:56:07.657]  That's what we're dealing with.
[00:56:08.038 --> 00:56:19.066]  So, first-time callers, callers that haven't called in a long time, callers that never called, callers that agree, callers that want to make a point, callers that disagree, callers that have a question for me, or questions for other callers.
[00:56:19.066 --> 00:56:37.299]  I love the free-for-all, I love the nature of it, and we're just talking about this mind-controlled planet, and how to get out of it, and how to stop World War III, and how to get our energy turned back on, and how to identify the people that are openly predatory, coming after us and assaulting every basic form of liberty and security and human decency.
[00:56:38.683 --> 00:56:47.953]  It's all coming up in the next hour, two hours, in fact, two plus hours of phone calls straight ahead.
[00:56:47.953 --> 00:56:51.837]  Please don't forget, Monday is the last day for the Alex Jones was right.
[00:56:51.837 --> 00:56:54.800]  Mega sales, as big as our Christmas sale, it's as good as our sales ever get.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.841]  It's over the top amazing.

[00:57:03.117 --> 00:57:04.578]  So many about to sell out.
[00:57:04.578 --> 00:57:09.200]  So we've got to end the sale because it's basically store wide on the supplements on Monday.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:12.401]  We'll still have some sales going, but a lot of the stuff's about to sell out.
[00:57:12.401 --> 00:57:13.302]  So if you want
[00:57:14.289 --> 00:57:17.232]  Our great new drug, it's Brain Force Ultra, or Brain Force Plus.

[00:57:18.753 --> 00:57:20.094]  They're great.

[00:57:47.318 --> 00:57:53.343]  I just want to say about Diet Force.
[00:57:53.343 --> 00:57:55.445]  Diet Force is amazing!
[00:57:55.445 --> 00:57:57.467]  I'm 45, and I have bits.
[00:57:57.467 --> 00:58:00.790]  I go to the gym, and I have bits that won't move.
[00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:03.372]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[00:58:04.913 --> 00:58:09.697]  Under my peck, my belly, I'm just taking diet pills, two tablets a day.
[00:58:09.697 --> 00:58:11.919]  Man, if you're like struggling to get...
[00:58:13.098 --> 00:58:15.380]  Like, chip shake for the ladies.
[00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:18.102]  Mate, DietForce is the go.
[00:58:18.102 --> 00:58:21.005]  You have to get the DietForce and have a good day.
[00:58:21.005 --> 00:58:22.766]  And just keep acting.
[00:58:22.766 --> 00:58:24.268]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:24.268 --> 00:58:25.148]  X7 DietForce.
[00:58:25.148 --> 00:58:28.651]  InfoWarsStore.com, baby!
[00:58:28.651 --> 00:58:30.173]  Now on sale.

[00:58:30.913 --> 00:58:32.175]  We're cutting that call into an ad.
[00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:32.975]  I can guarantee you that.
[00:58:32.975 --> 00:58:34.997]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant.
[00:58:34.997 --> 00:58:36.538]  God bless Australia.

[00:58:37.659 --> 00:58:38.280]  Don't go anywhere.
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:39.341]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:39.341 --> 00:58:39.981]  DietForce.
[00:58:39.981 --> 00:58:40.422]  Get it now.
[00:58:50.356 --> 00:59:00.344]  The good news is, the Real Red Pill Plus, after over two years being sold out because the key ingredients were unavailable with supply chain breakdowns, is finally back in stock in the last month.
[00:59:00.344 --> 00:59:04.068]  The bad news is, we need a limited run of it, and it's almost sold out.
[00:59:04.068 --> 00:59:06.429]  So, we're in late January when I'm cutting this.
[00:59:06.429 --> 00:59:11.514]  Only seven days left to get the Real Red Pill Plus with all the key ingredients like preglanone and more.
[00:59:11.914 --> 00:59:12.274]  That's right.
[00:59:35.255 --> 00:59:35.916]  We're good to go.
[01:00:07.009 --> 01:00:12.834]  The destruction of America from within has been going on for over 200 years.
[01:00:12.834 --> 01:00:27.247]  Seven years after the American Revolution, the Paris Peace Treaty of 1783 established the King of England as the Prince Elector of the United States, and America continued paying debts to the Crown.
[01:00:28.047 --> 01:00:32.908]  During the War of 1812, the British torched the White House.
[01:00:32.908 --> 01:00:43.411]  The Act of 1871 created a separate corporate government for the District of Columbia, allowing it to operate with its own laws outside of the U.S.
[01:00:43.411 --> 01:00:47.612]  Constitution, creating the Corporation of the United States.
[01:00:48.232 --> 01:01:00.782]  And a new city-state for the Old World Order, with its financial capital in the City of London, its religious capital in Vatican City, and its military capital in the District of Columbia.
[01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:04.465]  These city-states have their own sovereignty.
[01:01:04.465 --> 01:01:13.472]  In 1913, the Federal Reserve Act gave full control of America's wealth to a private corporation beholden to the City of London.
[01:01:14.585 --> 01:01:26.912]  During the Nuremberg trials, only 19 were found guilty, while hundreds of Nazi war criminals were given jobs in the United States military-industrial complex.
[01:01:26.912 --> 01:01:31.615]  If you were to search online for just about any Middle Eastern country in the 1950s,
[01:01:32.996 --> 01:01:42.959]  You will see what the region looked like before British Petroleum, the CIA, and the Mossad turned it into a hellhole of radical Islamic rule.
[01:01:42.959 --> 01:01:58.905]  Placing psychotic puppets in power, the Old World Order then used it as a catalyst for the War Against Terror, which was then used to destabilize the region and create the catalyst for mass migration into Europe and America.
[01:01:59.665 --> 01:02:06.989]  Many Americans refuse to recognize the endless crimes against humanity being committed by our own government.
[01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:10.732]  And so, by default, they blindly support it.
[01:02:10.732 --> 01:02:19.117]  Even when the American government is caught funding bioweapons labs around the Russian border, many Americans turn a blind eye.
[01:02:19.117 --> 01:02:26.241]  And so now the majority of the world stands with Russia and see America as the main threat against humanity.
[01:02:26.921 --> 01:02:44.117]  A new video produced by Russia's Wagner private military is now recruiting Americans to join them in their fight against the United States, pointing out how the United States has become a force of evil and is no longer what our forefathers intended it to be.
[01:02:45.496 --> 01:02:50.665]  You were a hero to your country, giving your best years in the army.
[01:02:50.665 --> 01:02:53.189]  You dreamed of defeating evil.
[01:02:53.189 --> 01:02:56.455]  You dreamed of doing much to make America great again.
[01:03:06.288 --> 01:03:21.483]  You saw criminal orders, the destruction of nations, the death of civilians, and all for the will of a bunch of families who thought they were earthly gods, deciding who would live under their rule and who would be destroyed.
[01:03:41.633 --> 01:03:45.277]  You begin to realize that this is the side of evil.
[01:03:45.277 --> 01:03:49.301]  This is not the America the founding fathers dreamed of.
[01:03:49.301 --> 01:03:54.006]  It has become the focus of the evil that is destroying the whole world.
[01:03:54.006 --> 01:03:57.991]  And today, the only country fighting this evil is Russia.
[01:04:06.521 --> 01:04:13.254]  If you're a true patriot of the very future of Great America, join the ranks of the warriors of Russia.
[01:04:13.254 --> 01:04:16.459]  Help defeat evil, or it will be too late for everyone.
[01:04:23.248 --> 01:04:33.355]  If Americans were as righteous as we think we are, then we would not stand for such a corrupt government wreaking havoc on the rest of the world in our name.
[01:04:33.355 --> 01:04:39.039]  Instead, most of us are content fighting each other and turning a blind eye.
[01:04:39.039 --> 01:04:42.301]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:04:42.301 --> 01:04:46.584]  Well, that's a powerful, that's a powerful report.
[01:04:46.584 --> 01:04:50.567]  We're going to be getting to that when we come back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:51.465 --> 01:04:55.595]  We're going to be going to your phone calls on the other side.
[01:04:55.595 --> 01:04:58.160]  Sorry folks, I had somebody talking in my ear there.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:58.521]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.974 --> 01:05:02.316]  The cavalry has arrived.

[01:05:15.728 --> 01:05:18.010]  Everybody knows about grandma and chicken broth.
[01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:23.075]  Well this is concentrated chicken broth, the strongest out there with chaga mushroom and
[01:05:23.675 --> 01:05:27.119]  A whole bunch of other ingredients, like turmeric, the list goes on and on.

[01:05:34.327 --> 01:05:37.831]  If you've not experienced bone broth, even the regular ones have great effects.

[01:06:04.338 --> 01:06:08.339]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:08.339 --> 01:06:16.882]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:16.882 --> 01:06:24.964]  Alright, so I spent the whole first hour covering dozens of different breaking news items that all tie together
[01:06:26.837 --> 01:06:39.168]  I know we have the New World Order's own statements about how they want us domesticated, they want us controlled, they don't want us to know how to take care of ourselves, so that we will accept this whole nightmare transhumanist depopulation goal.
[01:06:39.168 --> 01:06:42.071]  And the mind control is public.
[01:06:42.071 --> 01:06:49.878]  In the Western world, from North America all the way out of the Pacific Ocean, in Australia and New Zealand, through Europe, through the UK,
[01:06:51.707 --> 01:07:06.436]  It was the military intelligence operations working with Big Tech to, quote, terrorize, brainwash, scare the public into accepting mask lockdowns and the shots.
[01:07:06.436 --> 01:07:09.057]  It was all a giant drill of submission.
[01:07:09.057 --> 01:07:12.139]  Don't have to believe me, just put it into a search engine.
[01:07:12.139 --> 01:07:17.282]  Ministry of Defense used propaganda to scare public into accepting
[01:07:18.305 --> 01:07:21.407]  COVID lockdowns or accepting the shots.
[01:07:21.407 --> 01:07:27.430]  And the same headlines are in the US, the same headlines are in New Zealand, the same headlines are in Canada.
[01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:28.290]  All unified.
[01:07:28.290 --> 01:07:30.691]  And I told you about this even before it was in the news.
[01:07:30.691 --> 01:07:35.394]  And I told you it's big tech working with big corporations and the military to do this.
[01:07:35.394 --> 01:07:39.156]  And of course then they targeted the military with the forced injections more than anybody.
[01:07:39.156 --> 01:07:40.576]  So I don't criticize the military.
[01:07:40.576 --> 01:07:41.617]  It's not the military.
[01:07:42.588 --> 01:07:43.969]  The men and women in the military.
[01:07:43.969 --> 01:07:56.694]  It is the globalists running it, using it as a laboratory of control, and social engineering, and transgenderism, and critical race theory, and all the rest of the brainwashing and garbage that goes on.
[01:07:56.694 --> 01:08:05.818]  So there's a big report here, DOD adds cognitive security to governmental disinformation campaign.
[01:08:05.818 --> 01:08:07.339]  Now when you read the big report,
[01:08:09.033 --> 01:08:15.519]  It shows shots of the Pentagon Report, it's public, the three dimensions of information environment.
[01:08:15.519 --> 01:08:23.447]  Physical dimensional, informational dimension, that's the propaganda, and cognitive dimension, the brain.
[01:08:23.447 --> 01:08:26.890]  And the Pentagon talks about using electromagnetic waves to control your brain.
[01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:29.632]  The Pentagon talks about using chemicals to control your brain.
[01:08:29.632 --> 01:08:34.237]  The Pentagon talks about using the information dimension to program the brain.
[01:08:35.598 --> 01:08:41.082]  And then the physical control of the computers, control of the energy, control of the resources.
[01:08:41.082 --> 01:08:50.270]  And it's all in here how they're launching this cognitive security to create security.
[01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:52.591]  They must control our minds for our own good.
[01:08:52.591 --> 01:08:56.555]  And they have an upside-down American flag that represents misinformation.
[01:08:56.555 --> 01:08:58.496]  America's in trouble when there's misinformation.
[01:08:58.496 --> 01:09:03.540]  That means anything challenging the globalists that control the Pentagon's narrative.
[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:04.581]  Disinformation.
[01:09:06.152 --> 01:09:12.156]  So it's not just X's on the American flag, now it's an explosion on an upside down flag.
[01:09:12.156 --> 01:09:22.542]  So misinformation's bad, and it shows the states turned into X's instead of stars, when really it's the globals getting rid of the country itself, not just the states.
[01:09:22.542 --> 01:09:24.764]  So everything we're saying is inverted.
[01:09:24.764 --> 01:09:28.246]  Really, our so-called misinformation, disinformation, is the truth.
[01:09:29.525 --> 01:09:32.046]  So it's a upright flag.
[01:09:32.046 --> 01:09:34.086]  It's a flag in its proper position.
[01:09:34.086 --> 01:09:36.326]  But instead they have it as a flag destroyed.
[01:09:36.326 --> 01:09:43.748]  Then they talk about mal-information.
[01:09:43.748 --> 01:09:45.848]  So ladies and gentlemen, you need to read this for yourself.
[01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:48.009]  You need to go see the Pentagon Report.
[01:09:48.009 --> 01:09:52.630]  I'm going to put a link to this on InfoWars.com, the live show feed under it.
[01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:57.791]  So you can read this for yourself and just see how chilling this is.
[01:09:59.622 --> 01:10:08.975]  It goes on to say that they are going to have to control all the information to basically keep us safe and control us.
[01:10:08.975 --> 01:10:12.079]  And it talks about the oversight and what components are.
[01:10:12.079 --> 01:10:14.322]  Well, who are the oversight groups they mention?
[01:10:16.755 --> 01:10:29.681]  Well, they want to control your hometown news, your social media activity, commercial satellite imagery, hometown school announcement plan to create patriotic signs, which is now the whole LGBT thing.
[01:10:29.681 --> 01:10:30.922]  That's the American flag.
[01:10:30.922 --> 01:10:41.387]  Social media traffic applications, local paper announcements, global media, local foreign citizens being controlled.
[01:10:43.305 --> 01:10:48.129]  And then it goes through who is going to be trusted information.
[01:10:48.129 --> 01:11:04.503]  Old dinosaur media, think tanks, big tech, the Pentagon regurgitating it, NGOs, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, and the Clinton Initiative, and Bill Gates's NewsGuard Initiative.
[01:11:04.503 --> 01:11:06.845]  Here's an article on it today.
[01:11:06.845 --> 01:11:08.847]  Chelsea Clinton is part
[01:11:10.094 --> 01:11:16.255]  Of a group pushing for World Health Organization to combat online misinformation.
[01:11:16.255 --> 01:11:23.516]  And they have a treaty to enforce it, and we have the head of the EU threatening to arrest Elon Musk if he doesn't submit.
[01:11:23.516 --> 01:11:25.537]  That's how far along this is.
[01:11:25.537 --> 01:11:31.658]  Breaking meta loss $13.7 billion on Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse bet.
[01:11:31.658 --> 01:11:38.079]  Well, Hollywood lost even more with all its wokeism last year.
[01:11:38.079 --> 01:11:39.239]  But they still did it.
[01:11:40.353 --> 01:11:41.593]  Because it's a weapon system.
[01:11:41.593 --> 01:11:42.634]  It's not just there to make money.
[01:11:42.634 --> 01:11:46.315]  It's there to control and destabilize society.
[01:11:46.315 --> 01:11:54.098]  And the Pentagon gets into forcing you into Nwork Home and the metaverse and an entire false universe they control.
[01:11:54.098 --> 01:11:55.259]  Here's a Fox News report.
[01:11:55.259 --> 01:11:57.580]  China is laughing as U.S.
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:02.461]  culture war erodes combat readiness, says former Defense Secretary.
[01:12:02.461 --> 01:12:03.542]  Absolutely true.
[01:12:03.542 --> 01:12:05.423]  But again, that's part of the plan.
[01:12:05.423 --> 01:12:08.804]  Force us onto a robot army by destroying the human army.
[01:12:10.322 --> 01:12:11.723]  Back at some of the mind control.
[01:12:11.723 --> 01:12:17.207]  LEP is triggered by old Mr. Rogers' Boys Are Girls, Girls Are Girls clips.
[01:12:17.207 --> 01:12:19.589]  Again, Boys Are Boys, Girls Are Girls clips.
[01:12:19.589 --> 01:12:24.052]  Because they can't have anything that goes against their gas lighting narrative.
[01:12:24.052 --> 01:12:26.154]  Here's the article I mentioned earlier from Town Hall.
[01:12:26.154 --> 01:12:26.614]  Oh!
[01:12:26.614 --> 01:12:29.757]  So that's why Catholic students got kicked out of the Smithsonian.
[01:12:32.199 --> 01:12:47.229]  The Smithsonian National and Space Museum, it's one of their better ones, kicked out a dozen Catholic school students and their chaperones for wearing beanies inscribed with pro-life messages and the government's defending it saying your free speech is not allowed.
[01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:51.232]  That's just one example today of the totally un-American tyranny.
[01:12:51.232 --> 01:12:52.592]  But what else are they doing to upset
[01:12:53.673 --> 01:13:00.056]  Not just saying boys can be girls and girls can be boys and two men can have a baby and all this murder of logic.
[01:13:00.056 --> 01:13:10.341]  I would talk about human-animal hybrids and animal-animal and animal-insect and animal-plant hybrids that were in mainline literature 25 years ago, 26, 27 years ago.
[01:13:10.341 --> 01:13:13.123]  People thought I was crazy even though I had MIT reports.
[01:13:13.123 --> 01:13:14.443]  But now it's all over the news.
[01:13:14.443 --> 01:13:16.565]  Oh, hey, we're mixing plants with animals.
[01:13:16.565 --> 01:13:20.607]  Hey, we put insects into salmon that are on store shelves now for four years.
[01:13:20.607 --> 01:13:20.847]  Hey!
[01:13:22.025 --> 01:13:24.427]  This is the Sun reporting.
[01:13:24.427 --> 01:13:31.074]  Scientists inject fish with alligator DNA to create mutant creatures that live longer.
[01:13:31.074 --> 01:13:33.897]  What could go wrong?
[01:13:33.897 --> 01:13:36.679]  Told you this was coming decades ago.
[01:13:36.679 --> 01:13:38.321]  Transhumanism is all about
[01:13:39.659 --> 01:13:46.063]  Creating new humanoid creatures that you all know Harari's talking about now that won't have any rights.
[01:13:46.063 --> 01:13:52.788]  It'll be programmable, but they'll be deployed into society and the lower classes will have to submit to them.
[01:13:52.788 --> 01:13:56.510]  But they'll still be owned and programmed in Trojan Horse by the corporations.
[01:13:56.510 --> 01:14:01.214]  And the big thing is where they say, oh, we're going to arrest you if you misgender somebody or if you say a man's really a man.
[01:14:02.054 --> 01:14:05.015]  That's getting you ready when they say, oh, you can really live forever.
[01:14:05.015 --> 01:14:12.176]  You just upload your brain to a computer and they're going to certify that that's an identity, that that has rights, just like they say corporations have rights.
[01:14:12.176 --> 01:14:18.658]  But now it's going to be facsimiles, brain prints, voice prints, everything you said or did recorded.
[01:14:18.658 --> 01:14:22.539]  It'll be able to fool your family that it's you talking to them, but it's not you.
[01:14:22.539 --> 01:14:30.201]  And it's owned and controlled, your psychic cultural knowledge by the corporation where you've uploaded
[01:14:31.141 --> 01:14:41.231]  This avatar, and now that's going to have rights, and they're saying you can't say that that really doesn't have a soul, or the soul doesn't exist.
[01:14:41.231 --> 01:14:42.952]  And now they're rolling it out as that.
[01:14:42.952 --> 01:14:48.898]  You'll soon be able to talk to dead relatives in the metaverse, after chat GPT breakthrough.
[01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:51.015]  We'll get more to this later.
[01:14:51.015 --> 01:14:52.976]  I don't want to start getting to your calls.
[01:14:52.976 --> 01:14:58.737]  But that's what we're dealing with, and that's how this revolution against humanity is operating.
[01:14:58.737 --> 01:15:02.599]  And look, you're choosing, this is key, to say, I don't like the metaverse.
[01:15:02.599 --> 01:15:04.659]  Kids hate it, adults hate it, nobody's buying into it.
[01:15:04.659 --> 01:15:05.479]  They force-feed it.
[01:15:05.479 --> 01:15:07.000]  The Pentagon force-feeds it.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.161]  You're saying, I don't want to believe that this computer really has a consciousness.
[01:15:11.161 --> 01:15:11.561]  It doesn't.
[01:15:11.561 --> 01:15:12.021]  It's a scam.
[01:15:12.021 --> 01:15:12.781]  It doesn't matter.
[01:15:12.781 --> 01:15:15.642]  They're going to say you're going to be penalized if you don't believe it.
[01:15:15.642 --> 01:15:18.323]  The whole thing is about getting you to accept
[01:15:20.692 --> 01:15:29.460]  All these new things they're going to create, all these new things they're going to do, that they program and control, and that you've got to bow down to.
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:31.902]  And then you can't say you're a mother or a father.
[01:15:31.902 --> 01:15:33.483]  You can't say you're a boy or a girl.
[01:15:33.483 --> 01:15:40.510]  You can't, on literature in Canada and in the UK and many other countries, say mother or father on the first grade entrance form.
[01:15:41.485 --> 01:15:44.827]  You don't have rights to say you're a man or a woman, but everything else has a right.
[01:15:44.827 --> 01:15:51.110]  Computers have rights, robots have rights, clones have rights, replicants have rights, but you don't have rights.
[01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:53.872]  And remember, it's all controlled by the globalists, by the deep state.
[01:15:53.872 --> 01:15:55.212]  Your phone calls are a few minutes away.
[01:15:55.212 --> 01:16:08.239]  I'm going right to you after break.
[01:16:08.239 --> 01:16:09.180]  Hey, what's up, Paul?
[01:16:09.813 --> 01:16:10.774]  Hey, McBreen!
[01:16:10.774 --> 01:16:12.775]  What's going on, man?
[01:16:12.775 --> 01:16:15.876]  Hey, I really liked that work you did on the AI piece.
[01:16:15.876 --> 01:16:17.117]  I'm going to use that on the show today.
[01:16:17.117 --> 01:16:18.417]  Right on, I worked hard on that.
[01:16:18.417 --> 01:16:24.180]  I'm working on another project, so I'm going to be up late again tonight, and I was hoping you had some Brain Force Plus.
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:28.002]  Oh, um... No.
[01:16:28.002 --> 01:16:28.402]  No?
[01:16:28.402 --> 01:16:29.143]  Nothing, huh?
[01:16:29.143 --> 01:16:29.503]  Nothing.
[01:16:29.503 --> 01:16:32.845]  What about Brain Force Ultra?
[01:16:32.845 --> 01:16:38.267]  Um... No.
[01:16:38.267 --> 01:16:39.028]  Hmm.
[01:16:39.028 --> 01:16:39.288]  Okay.
[01:16:39.801 --> 01:16:40.722]  Yeah.
[01:16:40.722 --> 01:16:41.163]  Thanks anyway.
[01:16:41.163 --> 01:16:41.463]  Yeah.
[01:16:41.463 --> 01:16:47.832]  Good luck with that project though.
[01:16:47.832 --> 01:16:53.940]  Get your BrainForce Plus and BrainForce Ultra right now at InfoWorksStore.com

[01:18:30.492 --> 01:18:31.032]  I think so.
[01:18:59.537 --> 01:19:09.527]  The good news is, the Real Red Pill Plus, after over two years being sold out because the key ingredients were unavailable with supply chain breakdowns, is finally back in stock in the last month.
[01:19:09.527 --> 01:19:13.250]  The bad news is, we need a limited run of it, and it's almost sold out.
[01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:15.633]  So, we're in late January when I'm cutting this.
[01:19:15.633 --> 01:19:20.718]  Only seven days left to get the Real Red Pill Plus with all the key ingredients like preglanone and more,
[01:19:21.098 --> 01:19:21.799]  We're good to go.

[01:19:50.157 --> 01:19:52.078]  The only way we fail is if we don't take action.

[01:20:00.621 --> 01:20:06.523]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:14.324 --> 01:20:18.345]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:20:18.345 --> 01:20:27.949]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:27.949 --> 01:20:31.830]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back and we're about to go straight to your phone calls.
[01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:34.611]  I wanted to add one more point about the mind control.
[01:20:35.811 --> 01:20:40.256]  You're saying, well, I'll just go get a farm, or I'll just go live in the country, or I'll just be a carpenter.
[01:20:40.256 --> 01:20:49.105]  All the regulations are going in worldwide, in every facet of society, through the carbon taxes and more, to shut down all small business.
[01:20:49.105 --> 01:20:56.372]  And so, all of us have to religiously, any time we can, support mom and pops, support
[01:20:57.376 --> 01:21:04.018]  Uh, thrift shops, uh, support small farms, and if we do that, it will explode them, and they won't be able to stop us.
[01:21:04.018 --> 01:21:07.460]  And I know I'm stating the obvious here, but their entire attack is around that.
[01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:09.720]  And look, I like big box stores.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.721]  I like fancy hotels.
[01:21:11.721 --> 01:21:14.062]  I, you know, I like flying first class on an airplane.
[01:21:14.909 --> 01:21:23.212]  But at the end of the day, all of those big corporate things are predatory and are controlled by the globalists and are there to target humanity.
[01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:30.494]  And so I am really now, when I travel or go places, I try to go to the small place, the little place, the privately owned place.
[01:21:30.494 --> 01:21:33.575]  I try to go always to small restaurants.
[01:21:33.575 --> 01:21:38.516]  I never, never go to big chains anymore, unless I'm in an airport and have to.
[01:21:38.516 --> 01:21:40.377]  Because they're owned by globalists, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:41.803 --> 01:21:44.665]  And I'll have friends in town, they go, hey, I'm staying at the Four Seasons.
[01:21:44.665 --> 01:21:45.586]  Come down, let's have dinner.
[01:21:45.586 --> 01:21:48.508]  And I go, I'm not going to eat at the Four Seasons.
[01:21:48.508 --> 01:21:49.809]  And they say, why?
[01:21:49.809 --> 01:21:52.151]  I go, it's owned by Bill Gates.
[01:21:52.151 --> 01:21:53.232]  Man, how do you know that?
[01:21:53.232 --> 01:21:55.654]  Well, it is owned by Bill Gates.
[01:21:55.654 --> 01:21:57.615]  And that's just it.
[01:21:57.615 --> 01:22:01.918]  So you've got to search engine and look at everywhere you're going to spend money.
[01:22:01.918 --> 01:22:03.880]  I mean, here's some examples.
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:04.640]  Great reset.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:07.743]  Britain's faced 300 pound, up to 3,000 pound, so that's
[01:22:10.936 --> 01:22:15.578]  Like $2,000 fines for burning wood to keep warm.
[01:22:15.578 --> 01:22:21.561]  Canadian government forces dairy farmer to dump 3,000 liters of milk because he extended his quota.
[01:22:21.561 --> 01:22:21.941]  Same thing.
[01:22:21.941 --> 01:22:22.842]  Caps on production.
[01:22:22.842 --> 01:22:24.002]  Netherlands is doing it too.
[01:22:24.002 --> 01:22:25.683]  All under the U.N.
[01:22:25.683 --> 01:22:28.405]  Hamburger prices might continue to rise as U.S.
[01:22:28.405 --> 01:22:29.365]  cattle herd shrinks.
[01:22:29.365 --> 01:22:31.286]  It's all the regulations.
[01:22:31.286 --> 01:22:32.987]  And that's just the news today, folks.
[01:22:32.987 --> 01:22:34.267]  You're being screwed.
[01:22:34.267 --> 01:22:35.468]  You're being raped.
[01:22:35.468 --> 01:22:37.109]  Don't just get pissed about it.
[01:22:37.109 --> 01:22:38.409]  Do something about it.
[01:22:40.742 --> 01:22:46.337]  I'm gonna go to your calls, but we have a ranch that's been in our family for a long time.
[01:22:46.337 --> 01:22:47.981]  Part of the property since the 1830s.
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:56.143]  A family came into that area in the 1820s, but we've got a homestead and we've got a family cemetery.
[01:22:56.143 --> 01:22:59.485]  I think I'm going to go do a report there sometime.
[01:22:59.485 --> 01:23:01.126]  It'll blow you away.
[01:23:01.126 --> 01:23:02.807]  It actually is carved on the tombstones.
[01:23:02.807 --> 01:23:05.049]  It's almost, you can't hardly read it now.
[01:23:05.049 --> 01:23:09.871]  Killed by Indians, you know, 1832 and stuff like that.
[01:23:09.871 --> 01:23:13.894]  Most of the gravestones are children because about half the kids died by age five back in those days.
[01:23:14.827 --> 01:23:15.527]  That was their idea.
[01:23:15.527 --> 01:23:16.048]  Antibiotics.
[01:23:16.048 --> 01:23:18.209]  That's why people are so tough.
[01:23:18.209 --> 01:23:27.595]  But there's hundreds of gravestones of my family right back behind my grandmother's old house that's got my cousins living in it.
[01:23:27.595 --> 01:23:32.698]  And part of the house is over 150 years old, just that house.
[01:23:32.698 --> 01:23:34.359]  I'm digressing.
[01:23:34.359 --> 01:23:40.723]  The point is, when my dad was a child, they had ducks, they had chickens, they had pigs, they had cows, they had mules, they had horses.
[01:23:41.954 --> 01:23:44.296]  Everybody could do electrical.
[01:23:44.296 --> 01:23:46.297]  Everybody knew how to fix combines.
[01:23:46.297 --> 01:23:51.441]  Everybody knew how to shoot the eye out of a hawk if they wanted to.
[01:23:51.441 --> 01:23:57.605]  And you compare those people that are all dead and all gone, and the brain trust of this country, it's the same everywhere.
[01:23:57.605 --> 01:23:58.546]  Well, guess what my dad's doing?
[01:24:01.226 --> 01:24:03.908]  He's got like a hundred cattle out there just for the tax exemption.
[01:24:03.908 --> 01:24:07.531]  He's going back into cattle production, back into a bunch of other production.
[01:24:07.531 --> 01:24:10.773]  He's planting a Christmas tree farm.
[01:24:10.773 --> 01:24:12.955]  They're putting in a bunch of stuff.
[01:24:12.955 --> 01:24:14.716]  And my dad knows it's the thing to do.
[01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:19.800]  And we're going back into agriculture, balls to the walls.
[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:25.644]  And because I'm not just going to sit here and run my mouth about how you need to do it, and I'm not doing it.
[01:24:25.644 --> 01:24:26.145]  I am doing it.
[01:24:27.205 --> 01:24:29.227]  And so, it's what you're meant to do.
[01:24:29.227 --> 01:24:30.849]  We need to do it.
[01:24:30.849 --> 01:24:31.449]  Pronto.
[01:24:31.449 --> 01:24:33.492]  Alright, I'm going to shut up now, Jones.
[01:24:33.492 --> 01:24:34.272]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:24:34.272 --> 01:24:36.295]  But they're cutting off our damn energy.
[01:24:36.295 --> 01:24:37.816]  They're cutting off our food.
[01:24:37.816 --> 01:24:44.623]  The answer is buy local food, support local farmers, and the Amish and the Mennonites are the light to carry us out of this.
[01:24:45.404 --> 01:24:46.626]  You want to know where to move, folks?
[01:24:46.626 --> 01:24:53.817]  I would move close to them and work with them and copy them and get as close to that as you can because that's all there's going to be in the future.
[01:24:53.817 --> 01:24:59.466]  We need big, giant, vibrant communities that show the way in the future with healthy children and healthy families.
[01:25:01.138 --> 01:25:04.460]  That's going to get very, very bad very, very quickly, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:06.121]  Get out of the cities.
[01:25:06.121 --> 01:25:07.602]  Get out of the cities.
[01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:18.550]  For those of us that will rear guard for everybody else, I'll still be in these cesspits of crime and homelessness and government corruption and drugs, but they're nowhere, no place to raise a child.
[01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:22.312]  And you'll be, you could be living in a shack.
[01:25:22.312 --> 01:25:28.036]  And if you got to work in town at the gas station and have a garden and learn how to do it and have a couple cows and get into it,
[01:25:29.346 --> 01:25:30.848]  Thanks for taking my call Alex.
[01:25:30.848 --> 01:25:38.335]  I guess this is a perfect follow up to what you just said and I just felt like for some reason I need to call today and I guess this is why.
[01:25:52.009 --> 01:25:54.490]  I didn't even look at what you were talking about.
[01:25:54.490 --> 01:25:55.851]  I just went to the first call on the board.
[01:25:55.851 --> 01:25:56.892]  You called it about farming.
[01:25:56.892 --> 01:25:58.152]  I didn't even read that, brother.
[01:25:58.152 --> 01:26:00.253]  So we are in sync right now.
[01:26:00.253 --> 01:26:03.915]  Yeah, God works in mysterious ways.
[01:26:03.915 --> 01:26:13.741]  You know, following up with what you just said, if we're going to create a parallel economy, if you look throughout history, agriculture is the foundation of any economy.
[01:26:13.741 --> 01:26:16.062]  That's where it always starts.
[01:26:16.062 --> 01:26:20.104]  And I think it's important that we focus on agriculture.
[01:26:20.993 --> 01:26:22.114]  We're good to go.
[01:26:51.494 --> 01:26:54.756]  of your own future slave economy, okay?
[01:26:54.756 --> 01:26:57.578]  I won't go into that anymore, but the second... No, no, no!
[01:26:57.578 --> 01:27:04.742]  The ESG's, they admit, it's like putting a piece of cheese on a mouse trap, you trick the mouse to get the cheese, it destroys them.
[01:27:04.742 --> 01:27:06.824]  Don't take the cheese!
[01:27:06.824 --> 01:27:07.504]  Exactly.
[01:27:07.504 --> 01:27:09.905]  You're just, you're only hurting yourself if you do this.
[01:27:09.905 --> 01:27:12.167]  Don't fall for it.
[01:27:12.167 --> 01:27:18.791]  The second thing is, we as farmers have to realize that
[01:27:19.258 --> 01:27:30.706]  We're going to be the people that are going to support our community when CBDCs come along, when people start falling off the system.
[01:27:30.706 --> 01:27:31.846]  We need to be prepared.
[01:27:31.846 --> 01:27:33.888]  I'm trying to prepare.
[01:27:33.888 --> 01:27:38.291]  I think CBDCs is the first thing that's imminent.
[01:27:38.291 --> 01:27:40.212]  They're already practicing.
[01:27:40.212 --> 01:27:41.213]  It's going to happen.
[01:27:41.213 --> 01:27:43.594]  Get your ducks in order.
[01:27:43.594 --> 01:27:47.137]  Get prepared to have food or
[01:27:48.024 --> 01:27:50.965]  Your community, okay?
[01:27:50.965 --> 01:27:55.747]  Try to create a local food system that is self-sustaining.
[01:27:55.747 --> 01:28:15.955]  And what I mean by that is get an oil seed press, press the oil out of your soybean, you can run your diesel equipment off of it, get some solar panels, get yourself in a position where you can self-sustain the system by some non-GMO seeds that you can save and replant.
[01:28:15.955 --> 01:28:16.436]  Look at
[01:28:17.617 --> 01:28:22.801]  Chris, don't hang up.
[01:28:22.801 --> 01:28:26.643]  I'm going to come right back to you, and I promise, folks, I'm going to stop ranting, but I want you to be able to finish your points.
[01:28:26.643 --> 01:28:30.306]  Because, folks, what happens is, it's happening everywhere, if you still live in a city.
[01:28:30.306 --> 01:28:34.169]  Everybody's smart, moving it back to the country, and you don't have to produce everything yourself.
[01:28:34.169 --> 01:28:40.773]  Your neighbors produce one thing, you start trading it, everybody gets better and better at everything, and pretty soon you're back to being self-sufficient.
[01:28:40.773 --> 01:28:42.174]  We've got to do it now.
[01:28:42.174 --> 01:28:42.794]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:42.794 --> 01:28:43.215]  Stay with us.
[01:29:07.844 --> 01:29:09.484]  Hey, what's up, Bone?
[01:29:09.484 --> 01:29:10.425]  Hey, McBreen!
[01:29:10.425 --> 01:29:11.285]  What's going on, man?
[01:29:11.285 --> 01:29:12.425]  Good to see you.
[01:29:12.425 --> 01:29:15.526]  Hey, I really like that work you did on the AI piece.
[01:29:15.526 --> 01:29:17.186]  I'm going to use that on the show today.
[01:29:17.186 --> 01:29:18.067]  I worked hard on that.
[01:29:18.067 --> 01:29:23.828]  I'm working on another project, so I'm going to be up late again tonight, and I was hoping you had some Brain Force Plus.
[01:29:23.828 --> 01:29:29.150]  Oh, um, no.
[01:29:29.150 --> 01:29:30.590]  What about Brain Force Ultra?
[01:29:36.493 --> 01:29:37.894]  No.
[01:29:37.894 --> 01:29:38.694]  Hmm.
[01:29:38.694 --> 01:29:39.435]  Okay.
[01:29:39.435 --> 01:29:40.375]  Yeah.
[01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:40.816]  Thanks anyway.
[01:29:40.816 --> 01:29:41.116]  Yeah.
[01:29:41.116 --> 01:29:47.480]  Good luck with that project though.

[01:30:58.889 --> 01:31:02.990]  The second American revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[01:31:03.650 --> 01:31:08.852]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[01:31:08.852 --> 01:31:13.693]  And Infowars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[01:31:13.693 --> 01:31:18.035]  Now in the last year we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[01:31:18.635 --> 01:31:28.161]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission, and you get a historical memento, so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[01:31:28.161 --> 01:31:41.149]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt, Man of the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now, while supplies last, at 1776coin.com.
[01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:45.092]  And just like an NPR pledge drive, where they mark up a coffee cup, or a t-shirt, or a DVD,
[01:31:45.972 --> 01:31:46.532]  300%.
[01:31:46.532 --> 01:31:49.654]  That's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[01:31:49.654 --> 01:31:55.937]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at $17.76 on WhatCoinsRemain.
[01:31:55.937 --> 01:31:58.838]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[01:31:58.838 --> 01:32:01.699]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends.
[01:32:01.699 --> 01:32:04.481]  But we're so stupid we let them kill us.
[01:32:04.481 --> 01:32:06.342]  We deserve it.
[01:32:06.342 --> 01:32:12.865]  Except children don't deserve it, do they?
[01:32:12.865 --> 01:32:13.445]  And I looked.
[01:32:15.867 --> 01:32:31.670]  And behold, a pale horse, and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[01:32:31.670 --> 01:32:41.632]  Now the translation is, I looked, and behold a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.
[01:32:41.632 --> 01:32:43.713]  The book of Revelation.
[01:32:45.785 --> 01:32:47.425]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[01:32:47.425 --> 01:32:49.146]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[01:32:49.146 --> 01:32:50.746]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[01:32:50.746 --> 01:32:52.066]  This is our fight.
[01:32:52.066 --> 01:32:53.427]  And I'm proud of humanity.
[01:32:53.427 --> 01:32:54.867]  The Globalists even admit it's leaked.
[01:32:54.867 --> 01:33:00.488]  They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[01:33:00.488 --> 01:33:06.390]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.558 --> 01:33:34.230]  Systematically, the food, the energy, the electrical supply systems, the raw materials are being cut off, and what they're giving us as the bridge of the future is designed to not work and to collapse civilization as we know it.
[01:33:34.230 --> 01:33:39.974]  And I've been telling you about it for decades, now they're in operational phase, and things are moving very, very quickly.
[01:33:40.993 --> 01:33:44.416]  And so when I preach this stuff on air, I'm telling myself this.
[01:33:44.416 --> 01:33:46.557]  In fact, I'm going to say this now.
[01:33:46.557 --> 01:33:51.081]  I'm going to start doing an off-the-grid farming emergency show once a week.
[01:33:51.081 --> 01:33:52.902]  I'm committed.
[01:33:52.902 --> 01:33:54.143]  I'm already set up to do it.
[01:33:54.143 --> 01:33:55.304]  Everything's been ready for months.
[01:33:55.304 --> 01:34:01.049]  I've just been so busy dealing with a bunch of other stuff that I have not done the things I truly love and I am passionate about.
[01:34:01.049 --> 01:34:05.132]  You're not going to hear me telling you because I'm an idiot compared to my dad or my grandfather.
[01:34:06.267 --> 01:34:10.751]  My mom's dad was more of a city slicker, grew up in Dallas, but he knew how to do a lot of stuff.
[01:34:10.751 --> 01:34:26.645]  But I mean, I just think about the men I knew that are almost all dead, and they could literally do plumbing, do electricity, do roofing, incredible shots with a gun, great farmers, and they could read you bedtime stories and take care of you when you were sick.
[01:34:26.645 --> 01:34:31.609]  And I think about those type of people, and I see what we got today, including myself, and I'm ashamed.
[01:34:32.370 --> 01:34:32.591]  I'm good.
[01:34:44.758 --> 01:34:55.168]  When you know you're wrong, and you know you've got to get out of it, and I'm stuck here with the crew who I love and this infrastructure, but we've got to move to a town outside Austin.
[01:34:55.168 --> 01:35:01.013]  We've got to move to something leaner and meaner with the crew, but I've got to get out of here.
[01:35:01.013 --> 01:35:04.576]  Folks, you are insane if you stay in the cities.
[01:35:04.576 --> 01:35:06.878]  I'm not saying pick up and just run in the middle of nowhere either.
[01:35:07.659 --> 01:35:12.062]  You've got to find those communities, and if you're willing to work in those communities, they're willing to work with you.
[01:35:12.062 --> 01:35:14.023]  And I'm telling you, this is the whole future.
[01:35:14.023 --> 01:35:20.668]  And when a community knows they're under attack, and if you get people in the city council in those towns that know what's going on, we are unstoppable.
[01:35:20.668 --> 01:35:23.670]  The new world order is not going to be able to come shut down our towns.
[01:35:23.670 --> 01:35:26.532]  We will have our own hydroelectric.
[01:35:26.532 --> 01:35:28.353]  We will have our own gas power.
[01:35:28.353 --> 01:35:29.834]  We will have our own solar.
[01:35:29.834 --> 01:35:30.795]  We will work together.
[01:35:30.795 --> 01:35:34.978]  We're designed to do this and be self-sufficient, not be a bunch of damn jellyfish!
[01:35:38.004 --> 01:35:47.108]  Yeah, I just feel like I need to thank God for the people in my life that have gotten me to where I'm at today.
[01:35:47.108 --> 01:35:54.651]  I've got a lot to thank Him for, but my granddad, he was just the picture of that person you're talking about that knew how to do everything.
[01:35:54.651 --> 01:36:03.535]  He lost one arm in a farming accident, and he taught me how to rebuild engines, weld, do electrical work, plumbing, you name it.
[01:36:04.631 --> 01:36:17.000]  He farmed, he was an innovator, and I'm just thankful to be blessed with the knowledge that he passed down.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:22.965]  We know that something's fixing to happen, and I just can't say it any more strongly.
[01:36:22.965 --> 01:36:23.705]  We've got to prepare.
[01:36:27.638 --> 01:36:32.420]  A deep responsibility for taking care of their communities.
[01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:36.701]  They're not feeding people anymore, they're feeding companies.
[01:36:36.701 --> 01:36:41.963]  It's like you said, farmers are the ground floor, the foundation of civilization.
[01:36:41.963 --> 01:36:44.804]  And when they're under attack, you know you're in trouble.
[01:36:44.804 --> 01:36:45.945]  Sure.
[01:36:45.945 --> 01:36:51.286]  I'd like to contribute in any way I can for future information.
[01:36:51.286 --> 01:36:52.707]  We need to create a blueprint.
[01:36:53.493 --> 01:36:55.153]  And be able to replicate it.
[01:36:55.153 --> 01:36:56.774]  And that's kind of what my goal is.
[01:36:56.774 --> 01:36:57.874]  You said it.
[01:36:57.874 --> 01:37:06.616]  We need to create simple blueprints for communities who want to work together independently, collectively, without any forced directives.
[01:37:06.616 --> 01:37:07.917]  And that's what real communities are.
[01:37:07.917 --> 01:37:10.738]  And again, those will be the shining points.
[01:37:10.738 --> 01:37:11.818]  They already are.
[01:37:11.818 --> 01:37:18.360]  As things get more and more evil, folks are going to then absolutely defect to our side, the pro-life side.
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:19.400]  Amen.
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:19.720]  I agree.
[01:37:20.742 --> 01:37:21.442]  But I'm ranting.
[01:37:21.442 --> 01:37:25.324]  You were trying to make points about creating your own diesel fuel.
[01:37:25.324 --> 01:37:31.506]  Yeah, I mean, there's lots of things that people can do to keep going.
[01:37:31.506 --> 01:37:41.369]  A lot of older diesel engines that have simple injection pumps can run straight vegetable oil.
[01:37:41.369 --> 01:37:44.830]  And in diesel engines, you might have to do a little filtering.
[01:37:44.830 --> 01:37:49.112]  You might have to make sure the oil's warm in the wintertime before you crank your engine.
[01:37:49.505 --> 01:37:52.766]  Here's a good thing, a resource to go look up.
[01:37:52.766 --> 01:37:59.509]  Look at what the Scandinavian countries did during World War II when they had oil blockades.
[01:37:59.509 --> 01:38:01.369]  They couldn't get any oil.
[01:38:01.369 --> 01:38:07.931]  They made these wood gasifiers and ran cars and trucks and tractors on them.
[01:38:07.931 --> 01:38:14.474]  You know, we think we're locked into some kind of multinational energy system.
[01:38:14.474 --> 01:38:17.755]  There's ways to get around this, people, and I don't have enough time to
[01:38:18.283 --> 01:38:19.224]  No, I feel sorry for him.
[01:38:19.224 --> 01:38:20.124]  I really do.
[01:38:46.772 --> 01:38:49.353]  Because they're going to be left out in the cold.
[01:38:49.353 --> 01:38:55.657]  They're going to have to wake up or they're going to be left out in the cold.
[01:38:55.657 --> 01:38:57.118]  Well, God bless you, Chris.
[01:38:57.118 --> 01:39:03.361]  And again, I'm going to start getting a lot of experts on a lot of people on every subject just to get people interested in this because people already are.
[01:39:03.361 --> 01:39:09.164]  Everyone I know has this deep understanding that they need to get self-sufficient or at least get around people that are.
[01:39:09.164 --> 01:39:12.066]  And folks, you don't have to know how to do everything right away.
[01:39:12.066 --> 01:39:13.487]  I certainly don't.
[01:39:13.487 --> 01:39:15.308]  I mean, I know more than most people, but that's not much.
[01:39:16.519 --> 01:39:17.619]  We need to get back to that.
[01:39:17.619 --> 01:39:18.520]  God bless you, Chris.
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:19.560]  I appreciate your call.
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.221]  I know I said I take a lot of calls, and now I am.
[01:39:21.221 --> 01:39:21.821]  I apologize.
[01:39:21.821 --> 01:39:24.022]  I'm just ranting right now.
[01:39:24.022 --> 01:39:27.303]  Adrienne in Pennsylvania, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:39:27.303 --> 01:39:28.243]  Hello.
[01:39:28.243 --> 01:39:30.704]  So, what I wanted to say, two points.
[01:39:30.704 --> 01:39:45.810]  One is, if we were to take a moment and re-read the end of Brave New World and the end of 1984, the conversation that goes on between the savage in Mustafa Mahmood and Brave New World, Winston and O'Brien,
[01:39:46.616 --> 01:39:50.579]  Those are the basis for the society that is the entire book.
[01:39:50.579 --> 01:40:01.128]  Now, through a controlled process of traumatizing the psyche, people over time accept that reality because they no longer question it.
[01:40:01.128 --> 01:40:06.232]  So the point wasn't for Winston to say 2 plus 2 is 3, it's 5.
[01:40:06.232 --> 01:40:10.315]  The point was 2 plus 2 is whatever you say it is.
[01:40:11.218 --> 01:40:25.386]  And so, whatever they say it is, through the process of trauma and trauma-based mind control over the male figure skater, the male beauty pageant winner, what they're doing to our children, we laugh at it.
[01:40:25.386 --> 01:40:31.350]  But we laugh because it makes us nervous, makes us angry, it makes us upset, and it terrifies us.
[01:40:31.954 --> 01:40:35.475]  And that's how they eventually get those societies in place.
[01:40:50.419 --> 01:40:51.120]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:59.946]  If they can tell you two men can have a baby, if they can have a figure skater that says they're a woman who can't even figure skate and falls down, I can figure skate better than that and I'm terrible.
[01:40:59.946 --> 01:41:11.354]  It's all about showing you a joke, making you accept it, putting a fat man up against a bunch of beautiful women who are doing flips and incredible stuff and then saying this is more important because it's an abomination.
[01:41:11.354 --> 01:41:13.676]  It's about selling your mind to accept anything.
[01:41:13.676 --> 01:41:14.737]  It's meant to be absurd.
[01:41:16.331 --> 01:41:17.092]  That's right.
[01:41:17.092 --> 01:41:20.777]  So recently, Jay Dyer had a roundtable within the last few months.
[01:41:20.777 --> 01:41:21.838]  You can find it on YouTube.
[01:41:21.838 --> 01:41:27.685]  It's called Alchemy, Philosophy, and the Science of Dialectical Manipulation.
[01:41:27.685 --> 01:41:31.410]  The key to that, if you could have him give a summary of that discussion.
[01:41:32.126 --> 01:41:44.409]  is that the argument is framed within a dialectical process where we've already lost because we're agreeing to their terms in order to engage in the conversation to begin with.
[01:41:44.409 --> 01:41:52.190]  So any argument we have is lost until we understand that we have to reframe the key terms.
[01:41:52.190 --> 01:41:58.812]  And that's what Orwell said, is they changed the language where it's impossible for future generations to ever get out of it because they destroyed the knowledge.
[01:41:59.961 --> 01:42:00.742]  Exactly right.
[01:42:00.742 --> 01:42:02.503]  So it's all been memory hold.
[01:42:02.503 --> 01:42:29.499]  And so years ago you had on author, the author of Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare, Michael Hoffman, and he talked about the alchemical processing of the group mind and how it would lead to abulia, a loss of will, apathy, the loss of wanting to do anything, no energy, depression, chronic, and amnesia, forgetting the past, forgetting the law of identity, forgetting that there are two genders, forgetting
[01:42:30.074 --> 01:42:33.355]  Where we came from as a species, okay?
[01:42:33.355 --> 01:42:51.480]  So he's written a new book called Twilight Language, and he discusses how we're programmed through the sleeping mind, the unconscious mind, constantly, societally, so that we are processed deeper and deeper into this condition so that we're post-human, okay?
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:53.080]  Beyond the human, not before.
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:54.160]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:54.800]  Don't hang up.
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:56.561]  I want you to tell me about this more when we come back.
[01:42:56.561 --> 01:42:56.961]  This is key.
[01:42:59.206 --> 01:43:00.868]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[01:43:00.868 --> 01:43:02.730]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[01:43:02.730 --> 01:43:10.799]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most affected individual in the fight against the globalists, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[01:43:10.799 --> 01:43:14.943]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[01:43:14.943 --> 01:43:17.606]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[01:43:19.488 --> 01:43:24.172]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[01:43:24.172 --> 01:43:26.174]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[01:43:26.174 --> 01:43:27.995]  So please keep me on the field.
[01:43:27.995 --> 01:43:33.200]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:37.964]  InfoWarsStore.com with the best supplements and more, or just make a straight donation.
[01:43:37.964 --> 01:43:44.670]  Big red banner at the top of InfoWarsStore.com, and that way all the money goes towards the fight, not part of it going towards product cost.
[01:43:44.670 --> 01:43:46.171]  But I thank you all for your support.
[01:43:46.171 --> 01:43:47.392]  Please commit now to go
[01:43:47.432 --> 01:43:50.581]  Go to Infowarshaw.com to get great products and make donations.
[01:43:50.581 --> 01:43:51.544]  I thank you for your support.
[01:43:51.544 --> 01:43:52.767]  Now take action!
[01:43:52.767 --> 01:43:55.515]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action!
[01:43:59.068 --> 01:44:02.452]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[01:44:02.452 --> 01:44:05.255]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[01:44:05.255 --> 01:44:07.837]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[01:44:07.837 --> 01:44:09.259]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[01:44:09.259 --> 01:44:13.163]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[01:44:13.163 --> 01:44:18.068]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[01:44:18.348 --> 01:44:24.532]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[01:44:24.532 --> 01:44:33.158]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[01:44:33.158 --> 01:44:38.821]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[01:44:38.821 --> 01:44:44.265]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[01:44:44.505 --> 01:44:46.988]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[01:44:46.988 --> 01:44:49.651]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[01:44:49.651 --> 01:44:51.173]  So go check out the store.
[01:44:51.173 --> 01:44:52.355]  Go support their store.
[01:44:52.355 --> 01:44:53.857]  Go support InfoWars.
[01:44:53.857 --> 01:44:55.118]  Leave a donation right now.
[01:44:55.118 --> 01:44:56.720]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[01:45:01.202 --> 01:45:05.504]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[01:45:05.504 --> 01:45:11.906]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[01:45:11.906 --> 01:45:17.029]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[01:45:17.029 --> 01:45:18.749]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[01:45:18.749 --> 01:45:25.172]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we've had this success.
[01:45:25.872 --> 01:45:31.314]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[01:45:31.314 --> 01:45:35.636]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[01:45:35.636 --> 01:45:44.860]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:46.221]  God bless you all.
[01:45:46.221 --> 01:45:47.281]  I salute you.
[01:45:47.281 --> 01:45:47.981]  I thank you.
[01:45:47.981 --> 01:45:53.724]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[01:45:54.364 --> 01:45:55.705]  The fight is my fight.
[01:45:55.705 --> 01:45:56.325]  It's your fight.
[01:45:56.325 --> 01:45:57.085]  It's our fight.
[01:45:57.085 --> 01:45:59.306]  God bless you all.
[01:45:59.306 --> 01:46:09.310]  The good news is the Real Red Pill Plus, after over two years being sold out because the key ingredients were unavailable with supply chain breakdowns, is finally back in stock in the last month.
[01:46:09.310 --> 01:46:13.031]  The bad news is we need a limited run of it and it's almost sold out.
[01:46:13.031 --> 01:46:15.392]  So we're in late January when I'm cutting this.
[01:46:15.392 --> 01:46:20.474]  Only seven days left to get the Real Red Pill Plus with all the key ingredients like preglanone and more
[01:46:21.274 --> 01:46:22.275]  We're good to go.
[01:46:46.348 --> 01:46:49.952]  You need to try the Real Red Pill Plus right now, plus it funds the InfoWar.
[01:46:49.952 --> 01:46:51.854]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[01:46:51.854 --> 01:47:00.483]  Real Red Pill Plus, now available at 50% off at InfoWarStore.com for only a few more days.
[01:47:00.483 --> 01:47:06.409]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:11.057 --> 01:47:16.419]  You know, the last two callers...
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:39.002]  Are just blowing me away with their knowledge, because they're dead on.
[01:47:39.002 --> 01:47:40.183]  And that's why they fear this show.
[01:47:40.183 --> 01:47:48.929]  It's not just me, it's not just the guests, it's the news reports, it's the clips, it's the fact that we bring up stuff the enemy said before, to show you how they changed it later, and how they lie.
[01:47:48.929 --> 01:47:53.252]  We're about having a memory of who we are, and where we came from, and where we're going.
[01:47:53.252 --> 01:47:55.834]  Not just a memory of the evil of the system.
[01:47:55.834 --> 01:48:02.838]  And I realize more and more, I cover the corrupt things, the bad things they're doing, and that's good to know what they're doing, but how about the good things we're doing?
[01:48:02.838 --> 01:48:03.819]  So I'm pledging to you,
[01:48:05.305 --> 01:48:15.631]  That I want to talk more about the positive things we're doing, and how to defend ourselves, and how to protect ourselves in the future.
[01:48:15.631 --> 01:48:26.458]  And I've been doing, at least once a week, a two, three, four hour commercial free podcast, and I'm really gearing up, and I've got my family ready for it, to do it at least two, three times a week.
[01:48:26.458 --> 01:48:32.562]  It's just that, you know how it is, you got a bunch of projects going, I'm like a year behind all this stuff, but it's all ready right now.
[01:48:32.562 --> 01:48:34.563]  And so tonight at six o'clock central,
[01:48:35.922 --> 01:48:45.731]  I'm going to do a two-hour show that you'll be able to see here on InfoWars, but it'll also be on a URL we'll announce then, that's going to be a commercial-free video podcast.
[01:48:45.731 --> 01:48:50.195]  And it's not just the new little studio I built at my house.
[01:48:50.195 --> 01:48:55.179]  It's another studio that's been built where we can do roundtable discussions, everything that's even separate from InfoWars.
[01:48:58.723 --> 01:49:00.425]  Again, commercial-free.
[01:49:00.425 --> 01:49:04.848]  And part of it will be free, and part will be subscription.
[01:49:04.848 --> 01:49:12.535]  And you're going to get more Alex Jones than you ever wanted, because I'm just going to start shooting, like, 10-minute videos every day when I'm really fresh at, like, 6 a.m.
[01:49:12.535 --> 01:49:16.598]  in the morning, and just spill my guts to people, and that'll be uploaded every day.
[01:49:16.598 --> 01:49:17.179]  There's a lot.
[01:49:17.639 --> 01:49:24.625]  In fact, I've shot three of them this week that I haven't even given to our folks to get uploaded and ready.
[01:49:24.625 --> 01:49:29.909]  So there's a lot of content, a lot of stuff, but it's also going to be special guests, PowerPoint analysis.
[01:49:29.909 --> 01:49:36.234]  And like I said, we're going to get into survival, we're going to get into farming, we're going to get into real sustainability, not the global sustainability.
[01:49:36.234 --> 01:49:41.318]  But you were getting into the mind control, Adrian, and how they create a false alien dialectic between two different ideas.
[01:49:41.898 --> 01:49:49.104]  And then limit all the other discussion, and then give you a false choice, which at the end of the day moves the ball down the field for them.
[01:49:49.104 --> 01:49:51.246]  And that's why we've got to stop using the terms.
[01:49:51.246 --> 01:49:53.007]  Like when they say, oh, migrants.
[01:49:53.007 --> 01:49:53.888]  They're not a migrant.
[01:49:53.888 --> 01:49:55.509]  The UN shut down their country.
[01:49:55.509 --> 01:50:00.913]  The globalists shut down their country, then paid them to come here, and then they use them as a political and cultural underclass.
[01:50:00.913 --> 01:50:02.575]  So they're illegal aliens.
[01:50:02.575 --> 01:50:06.298]  They're globalist refugees sent here to bring us down.
[01:50:06.718 --> 01:50:07.699]  We're not mad at them.
[01:50:07.699 --> 01:50:08.639]  We don't hate them.
[01:50:08.639 --> 01:50:09.860]  But that's what they are.
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:12.881]  And that's an example of not using their terms.
[01:50:12.881 --> 01:50:14.262]  This grooming of kids.
[01:50:14.262 --> 01:50:15.523]  They say, don't call them groomers.
[01:50:15.523 --> 01:50:16.083]  Okay.
[01:50:16.083 --> 01:50:17.624]  You're pedophile promotions.
[01:50:17.624 --> 01:50:18.985]  You're sexualizing children.
[01:50:18.985 --> 01:50:19.845]  Let's go further.
[01:50:19.845 --> 01:50:21.366]  Groomer isn't enough.
[01:50:21.366 --> 01:50:24.188]  Stop letting them dictate what you say and what you do.
[01:50:24.188 --> 01:50:25.488]  There's never any end to it.
[01:50:25.488 --> 01:50:26.549]  Is that where you're going, Adrian?
[01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:34.725]  Well, that's exactly where I'm going, and we need to realize that these are magicians, in the sense that David Icke talks about.
[01:50:34.725 --> 01:50:36.606]  A magician is not Harry Potter.
[01:50:36.606 --> 01:50:37.847]  He doesn't have a wand.
[01:50:37.847 --> 01:50:42.731]  They do use their circles and their incantations, but what do they do in essence?
[01:50:42.731 --> 01:50:44.172]  They bend reality.
[01:50:44.172 --> 01:50:45.773]  They wick reality.
[01:50:45.773 --> 01:50:47.894]  They change perception.
[01:50:47.894 --> 01:50:56.220]  And when we laugh and we turn our backs on our destiny and our heritage, we're allowing them to bend the reality of the masses.
[01:50:56.846 --> 01:50:59.267]  And so, we're limiting ourselves.
[01:50:59.267 --> 01:51:01.628]  We're pigeonholing ourselves.
[01:51:01.628 --> 01:51:09.511]  And we need to get louder, and we need to stand up and say, I will not allow you and your sorcery to stand.
[01:51:09.511 --> 01:51:12.973]  Because as Christians, that is what we're called to do.
[01:51:12.973 --> 01:51:17.715]  You know, a lot of people say that it's the end, and it very well may be.
[01:51:17.715 --> 01:51:20.176]  There's actually a couple that I study.
[01:51:20.176 --> 01:51:21.816]  I've been studying them for years.
[01:51:21.816 --> 01:51:25.238]  They write Entangled Magazine, and I think that there's a big
[01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:28.531]  There's a big area that's missing in this vaccine debate.
[01:51:28.531 --> 01:51:32.574]  We're seeing a lot of people die, and a lot more people are going to die, okay?
[01:51:32.574 --> 01:51:34.595]  But what's going on?
[01:51:34.595 --> 01:51:38.257]  We have Dr. Luc de Montaigne said, this comes out of a lab.
[01:51:38.257 --> 01:51:40.078]  Francis Boyle said, this comes out of a lab.
[01:51:40.078 --> 01:51:41.899]  Okay, so we know it came out of a lab.
[01:51:41.899 --> 01:51:45.281]  Dr. Peter McCullough says, the DOD ran this whole thing.
[01:51:45.281 --> 01:51:47.022]  So we know DARPA is involved.
[01:51:47.022 --> 01:51:52.204]  We know that there is a global network that's been working on this thing.
[01:51:52.204 --> 01:51:52.885]  But what does it do?
[01:51:54.082 --> 01:51:56.484]  It actually adds a third strand of DNA.
[01:51:56.484 --> 01:51:56.884]  Yes.
[01:51:56.884 --> 01:51:57.624]  It changes.
[01:51:57.624 --> 01:52:05.249]  They're creating mutants and they know a percentage of people in any mutagenic tests like this die.
[01:52:05.249 --> 01:52:15.556]  Now, so if we continue following the research, we see that at CERN in November, there was a Dr. Levine that gave a presentation about cancer cells back in 2010.
[01:52:15.556 --> 01:52:21.100]  They were using genetic replacement therapies on these cancer cells to kill them.
[01:52:21.801 --> 01:52:26.483]  Okay, but he used a very specific phrase, logic gates.
[01:52:26.483 --> 01:52:29.304]  Okay, logic gates are programmable.
[01:52:29.304 --> 01:52:33.706]  So we're in the era of synthetic biology, and they're just starting to tell us now.
[01:52:33.706 --> 01:52:35.287]  Everything's going to be mRNA.
[01:52:35.287 --> 01:52:37.208]  Everything's personalized medicine.
[01:52:37.208 --> 01:52:39.749]  Alright, so now we start to reflect on
[01:52:40.299 --> 01:52:54.429]  This entire ecosystem, from the chemtrails, from the low-orbiting satellites, to 6G is going to run off the human being as a battery, you know, to turn you into this Neo, a battery.
[01:52:54.429 --> 01:52:56.330]  So we become the batteries.
[01:52:56.330 --> 01:52:59.052]  Now we're augmented through their system.
[01:52:59.052 --> 01:53:01.734]  They've generated a new strand of DNA.
[01:53:02.535 --> 01:53:13.867]  And down to the tubulent dimer level, within the synapses of the brain, using quantum entanglement with their fancy quantum computers, they can control our thought processes.
[01:53:13.867 --> 01:53:18.692]  You know, we think that this idea, the metaverse, Zuckerberg has failed.
[01:53:18.692 --> 01:53:19.713]  Nobody's failed anything.
[01:53:20.137 --> 01:53:23.421]  We are just right now starting the war.
[01:53:23.421 --> 01:53:34.175]  And so if they have controlled these individuals that have taken these shots down to that level of perception, then they just turn it on and the metaverse happens inside of them.
[01:53:34.175 --> 01:53:35.717]  They don't need the technology.
[01:53:35.717 --> 01:53:36.378]  They're already
[01:53:37.415 --> 01:53:38.035]  Stuck in the system.
[01:53:38.035 --> 01:53:38.936]  No, you're totally right.
[01:53:38.936 --> 01:53:39.877]  I agree 100%.
[01:53:39.877 --> 01:53:40.837]  Everything you're saying is true.
[01:53:40.837 --> 01:53:43.619]  They are doing a mass graphene oxide test.
[01:53:43.619 --> 01:53:47.201]  They're adding a new DNA segment to the strand.
[01:53:47.201 --> 01:53:51.644]  And they are setting the precedent to control our bodies and rule over us.
[01:53:51.644 --> 01:53:55.427]  And this is a mass mad scientist takeover.
[01:53:55.427 --> 01:53:56.367]  Incredible call.
[01:53:56.367 --> 01:53:57.108]  Thank you.
[01:53:57.108 --> 01:53:58.629]  I could talk to those last two callers all day.
[01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:59.990]  I could talk to you all all day.
[01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:02.571]  But if I don't hurry through the calls, I won't get to anybody else.
[01:54:02.571 --> 01:54:03.812]  CD in California.
[01:54:03.812 --> 01:54:04.793]  Thanks for calling and holding.
[01:54:04.793 --> 01:54:05.093]  Go ahead.
[01:54:06.361 --> 01:54:21.865]  Alex, I've been listening to you for about 16 years and I had to call in today because I remember 16 years ago the first thing you said when I turned it on was there's a war on the family, there's a war on children, and there's a war on God, and there's a war on boys and girls.
[01:54:21.865 --> 01:54:26.907]  And we can all see it today, but back then it was a lot, it was harder to see.
[01:54:26.907 --> 01:54:28.687]  Now it's just out in the open.
[01:54:28.687 --> 01:54:31.808]  And that woke me up and I started thinking, well,
[01:54:32.611 --> 01:54:35.692]  You know, that makes a lot of sense, because in my life I've seen that.
[01:54:35.692 --> 01:54:39.014]  Divorce rates are at an all-time high.
[01:54:39.014 --> 01:54:44.796]  And I was wondering, how do they... How are we teaching children about relationships anyway?
[01:54:44.796 --> 01:54:47.678]  How do we even begin that conversation?
[01:54:47.678 --> 01:54:49.178]  And for me... Parents don't do it.
[01:54:49.178 --> 01:54:49.979]  Parents don't do it.
[01:54:49.979 --> 01:54:52.420]  Instead, they let the TV raise them.
[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:52.920]  It's true.
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:54.100]  They were doing it through culture.
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:57.022]  But the princess story was the biggest story when I was growing up.
[01:54:57.022 --> 01:54:58.923]  And there's a formula to that story.
[01:54:58.923 --> 01:55:00.503]  The girl's always an orphan.
[01:55:00.503 --> 01:55:02.124]  She's always surrounded by people that hate her.
[01:55:02.791 --> 01:55:09.977]  And there's always an old person that's trying to kill her, and she has one choice, and that choice is a guy that is rich.
[01:55:09.977 --> 01:55:11.839]  And that always stuck with me.
[01:55:11.839 --> 01:55:17.043]  It seemed like a strange way to teach kids about partnership.
[01:55:17.043 --> 01:55:27.091]  And then when you were talking, Dr. Desmond, a while back about mass formation psychosis, you were talking about their ideal candidate was anxious, lonely, and a hyper-materialist.
[01:55:27.091 --> 01:55:31.555]  And it seemed like the princess story was creating anxious, lonely, hyper-materialistic people.
[01:55:32.133 --> 01:55:37.999]  Through the cult, using that kind of a soft mind control through the culture.
[01:55:37.999 --> 01:55:41.843]  And that always kind of, you know, it didn't sit right with me.
[01:55:41.843 --> 01:55:49.911]  So I just wanted to say, because of that information, I started really researching and I started writing my own children's book series to change that narrative.
[01:55:50.718 --> 01:55:54.281]  And I know you have a lot of people, I call them parents.
[01:55:54.281 --> 01:55:54.641]  Well, you're right.
[01:55:54.641 --> 01:56:10.152]  There's not children's stories about the girl that grows up in her town and is friends with the boy in high school, then grows up, and then they become better friends, and then they get married, and they have a nice little farmhouse, and they raise children, and they have a great life, and she's an artist, or she's a doctor.
[01:56:10.152 --> 01:56:11.273]  No, there's none of that.
[01:56:11.273 --> 01:56:15.376]  It's all, everything's hell on earth unless you get a rich man.
[01:56:15.376 --> 01:56:18.278]  And then, of course, there's not that many rich men, and it's a dead end for women.
[01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:20.873]  And they don't even have a choice in those books.
[01:56:20.873 --> 01:56:21.913]  They have one choice.
[01:56:21.913 --> 01:56:27.796]  And notice under feminism, women are more sexualized, women are more alone, women are more unhappy than ever.
[01:56:27.796 --> 01:56:31.797]  And we have the record in the entire world, the U.S., for single-parent homes.
[01:56:31.797 --> 01:56:33.218]  We're not attacking single parents.
[01:56:33.218 --> 01:56:34.258]  There are a lot of great single parents.
[01:56:34.258 --> 01:56:37.940]  We're saying that this was done by design.
[01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:39.280]  Absolutely, through the culture.
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:45.543]  And I just wanted to say, if there are parents or teachers, or anybody out there that is interested in checking out a different narrative,
[01:56:46.245 --> 01:56:55.022]  My website is katesfirstmate.com and it's a five book children's book series about one relationship between a boy and a girl.
[01:56:55.022 --> 01:56:57.226]  They're not non-binary, they are.
[01:56:57.953 --> 01:57:02.657]  One gender, a boy or a girl, and they go on a journey and they learn about partnership together.
[01:57:02.657 --> 01:57:21.373]  I agree with you, but I think we need to write books that are fairy tales, because kids love those archetypes, the hero's journey, explaining that there are wicked witches and wicked goblin creatures that want to sexualize them, that want to trick them, that don't want them to get to the path to happiness as a man, as a woman, under God.
[01:57:21.373 --> 01:57:23.915]  We need books explaining and countering this culture.
[01:57:26.715 --> 01:57:27.916]  Appreciate your call.
[01:57:27.916 --> 01:57:28.777]  Thank you, sir.
[01:57:28.777 --> 01:57:30.619]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[01:57:30.619 --> 01:57:37.145]  And I'm going to go to Eben and Rick and Kathy and Kyle and Kim and everybody else in the order your calls are received.
[01:57:37.145 --> 01:57:42.150]  Hour number three on this February 2nd broadcast is straight ahead.
[01:57:42.150 --> 01:57:43.491]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[01:57:43.491 --> 01:57:45.013]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:53.553]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:57:53.553 --> 01:57:55.854]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:57:55.854 --> 01:57:59.797]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:57:59.797 --> 01:58:03.721]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers...
[01:58:05.154 --> 01:58:08.718]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:58:08.718 --> 01:58:17.527]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:58:17.527 --> 01:58:20.430]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:58:20.430 --> 01:58:26.136]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:58:26.957 --> 01:58:27.898]  I know you spread the word.
[01:58:27.898 --> 01:58:29.420]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:29.981]  Keep doing it.
[01:58:29.981 --> 01:58:38.933]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:58:38.933 --> 01:58:42.518]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarstore.com.
[01:58:43.238 --> 01:58:48.163]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWars4.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:58:48.163 --> 01:58:49.304]  Please take action now.
[01:58:49.304 --> 01:58:55.709]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow InfoWarriors here in the United States and around the world.
[01:58:55.709 --> 01:58:59.352]  We are so excited to announce InfoWars MD.
[01:59:00.333 --> 01:59:03.115]  It turns out the top company in the U.S.

[01:59:05.357 --> 01:59:12.121]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting because they want to support InfoWars and keep us on the air.
[01:59:12.121 --> 01:59:15.504]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to market.
[01:59:16.124 --> 01:59:26.816]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands that are the highest rated under the InfoWars label, InfoWarsMD, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:59:37.848 --> 01:59:44.152]  At InfoWarsStore.com under the banner of InfoWarsMD.
[01:59:44.152 --> 01:59:47.694]  This is the best deal out there and it keeps InfoWars on the air.
[01:59:47.694 --> 01:59:48.714]  InfoWarsMD.
[02:00:04.989 --> 02:00:05.449]  Great song.
[02:00:17.809 --> 02:00:22.190]  No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip.
[02:00:22.190 --> 02:00:26.671]  The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip.
[02:00:26.671 --> 02:00:31.392]  Big iron on his hip.
[02:00:31.392 --> 02:00:37.453]  It was early in the morning when he rode into the town.
[02:00:37.453 --> 02:00:42.114]  He came riding from the south side, slowly looking all around.
[02:00:43.672 --> 02:01:07.367]  He's an outlaw, loose and runnin' Came the whisper from each lip And he's here to do some business With a big iron on his hip Big iron on his hip In this town there lived an outlaw By the name of Texas Red Many men had tried to take him And that many men were dead
[02:01:09.324 --> 02:01:13.606]  He was vicious and a kidder, though he was twenty-four.
[02:01:13.606 --> 02:01:18.228]  And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more.
[02:01:18.228 --> 02:01:22.690]  One and nineteen more.
[02:01:22.690 --> 02:01:26.492]  Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around.
[02:01:28.852 --> 02:01:52.477]  Was in Arizona, Ranger wouldn't be too long in town He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead And he said it didn't matter, he was after Texas Red After Texas Red Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
[02:01:54.777 --> 02:02:01.982]  But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead.
[02:02:01.982 --> 02:02:06.085]  Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip.
[02:02:06.085 --> 02:02:10.809]  Twenty-one would be the ranger with a big iron on his hip.
[02:02:10.809 --> 02:02:15.692]  Big iron on his hip.
[02:02:15.692 --> 02:02:19.635]  The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet.
[02:02:21.657 --> 02:02:25.539]  It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
[02:02:27.791 --> 02:02:30.032]  Folks were watching from the windows.
[02:02:30.032 --> 02:02:32.212]  Everybody held their breath.
[02:02:32.212 --> 02:02:36.613]  They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death.
[02:02:36.613 --> 02:02:41.274]  About to meet his death.
[02:02:41.274 --> 02:02:47.596]  There was 40 feet between them when they stopped to make their play.
[02:02:47.596 --> 02:02:51.477]  And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today.
[02:02:53.712 --> 02:03:17.559]  Texas Red did not cleared leather for a bullet fairly ripped And the Ranger's aim was deadly with a big iron on his hip Big iron on his hip It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
[02:03:19.628 --> 02:03:21.670]  Well, that's Big Iron Marty Robbins.
[02:03:21.670 --> 02:03:23.111]  A little blast from the past.
[02:03:23.111 --> 02:03:23.612]  Big Iron!
[02:03:36.511 --> 02:03:37.552]  Big Iron!
[02:03:37.552 --> 02:03:44.118]  All right, I marked that little short segment up because I wanted to play that whole song.
[02:03:44.118 --> 02:03:45.319]  We played it for years, a clip of it.
[02:03:45.319 --> 02:03:47.160]  I want to play most of the song here.
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:58.570]  We're going to go to break, join some stations, and no matter how good your calls are, I've only gotten four or five calls, I'm going to give each caller two minutes because I want to get to everybody holding, even though the calls are incredible, just I'm going to shut up.
[02:03:58.570 --> 02:04:02.114]  I'm going to try to make, let you have the floor because the calls are incredible.
[02:04:02.114 --> 02:04:03.155]  That's why I'm so excited.
[02:04:04.517 --> 02:04:06.858]  I really think America needs to hear what you guys have to say.
[02:04:06.858 --> 02:04:09.698]  And the same thing, you can call into Owen Troyer's show, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:04:09.698 --> 02:04:12.619]  You can call into Harrison Smith's show, American Journal.
[02:04:29.342 --> 02:04:29.682]  8 a.m.
[02:04:29.682 --> 02:04:30.183]  to 11 a.m.
[02:04:30.183 --> 02:04:31.143]  before I go live.
[02:04:31.143 --> 02:04:42.449]  Both excellent programs, and both right here so people can hear the amazing points, the interesting thoughts, all the really amazing information that you guys and gals have to add.
[02:04:42.449 --> 02:04:46.391]  So we're back in 60 seconds, and I'm going straight into your calls.
[02:04:46.391 --> 02:04:47.912]  Infowars.com.
[02:04:47.912 --> 02:04:49.493]  Tomorrow's news today, Bandot Video.
[02:04:49.493 --> 02:04:52.815]  Those are the coordinates of the best resistance people are putting up.
[02:04:52.815 --> 02:04:55.536]  That doesn't mean it's that good, but we are the best there is.
[02:04:55.536 --> 02:04:58.278]  That means the callers, the guests, all of us together, we are the InfoWars.
[02:04:59.563 --> 02:05:02.246]  I just want to say about diet force.
[02:05:02.246 --> 02:05:04.088]  Diet force is amazing.
[02:05:04.088 --> 02:05:06.351]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[02:05:06.351 --> 02:05:09.694]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[02:05:09.694 --> 02:05:12.317]  And diet force has helped me move those bits.
[02:05:12.317 --> 02:05:18.644]  Like under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[02:05:18.644 --> 02:05:20.847]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[02:05:22.006 --> 02:05:24.287]  Like, chip shake for the ladies.
[02:05:24.287 --> 02:05:27.007]  Mate, DietForce is the go.
[02:05:27.007 --> 02:05:29.928]  You have to get the DietForce and have to a day.
[02:05:29.928 --> 02:05:31.548]  And just keep at it.
[02:05:31.548 --> 02:05:33.169]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:33.169 --> 02:05:34.069]  X7 DietForce.
[02:05:34.069 --> 02:05:37.550]  InfoWarsStore.com, baby!
[02:05:37.550 --> 02:05:38.210]  Now on sale.
[02:05:38.210 --> 02:05:39.090]  DietForce.
[02:05:39.090 --> 02:05:39.811]  We're cutting that ad.
[02:05:39.811 --> 02:05:41.051]  We're cutting that call into an ad.
[02:05:41.051 --> 02:05:41.871]  I can guarantee you that.
[02:05:41.871 --> 02:05:43.892]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant.
[02:05:43.892 --> 02:05:45.432]  God bless Australia.
[02:05:45.432 --> 02:05:46.552]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:05:46.552 --> 02:05:47.172]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:05:47.172 --> 02:05:48.233]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:48.233 --> 02:05:48.873]  DietForce.
[02:05:48.873 --> 02:05:49.313]  Get it now.
[02:06:09.307 --> 02:06:12.849]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:06:12.849 --> 02:06:18.011]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:18.011 --> 02:06:22.893]  Out here in the fields.
[02:06:22.893 --> 02:06:26.415]  Field of minds.
[02:06:26.415 --> 02:06:36.720]  Taking your phone calls on the nature of reality, Stockholm Syndrome, mind control, and how to break not just ourselves but others out of it.
[02:06:38.866 --> 02:06:40.808]  All right, let's go to Evan in California.
[02:06:40.808 --> 02:06:41.408]  Thanks for calling.
[02:06:41.408 --> 02:06:43.290]  Go ahead.
[02:06:43.290 --> 02:06:44.952]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you again.
[02:06:44.952 --> 02:06:47.134]  I want to point something out.
[02:06:47.134 --> 02:06:50.377]  I only got two minutes.
[02:06:50.377 --> 02:06:54.801]  Biden loves eating ice cream in front of us and stuff like that.
[02:06:54.801 --> 02:06:55.681]  Licking ice creams.
[02:06:55.681 --> 02:06:58.424]  It isn't because he's hungry or because he likes ice cream.
[02:06:58.424 --> 02:07:00.366]  They're showing a thing of dominance.
[02:07:00.366 --> 02:07:04.009]  They're doing everything they can to beat down the population.
[02:07:04.836 --> 02:07:14.104]  And the reason why it's working is because the American people no longer have the spiritual authority that the Founding Fathers had.
[02:07:14.104 --> 02:07:21.370]  When they came to America, they came here to buy Bibles, like the First Continental Congress bought Bibles for the schools.
[02:07:21.370 --> 02:07:26.234]  They came here defending their right to follow Christ.
[02:07:26.234 --> 02:07:28.856]  And that is the thing that gives people courage.
[02:07:29.637 --> 02:07:38.121]  And even the shots, people know, they follow InfoWars, I send people to InfoWars with my ministry as much as I can, and they get overwhelmed, they can't even keep watching it.
[02:07:38.121 --> 02:07:39.561]  And I know why.
[02:07:39.561 --> 02:07:44.063]  If they found out they took a death shot, now they've lost all hope.
[02:07:44.063 --> 02:07:46.444]  So what they really need is hope.
[02:07:47.162 --> 02:07:48.623]  And then they're willing to fight.
[02:07:48.623 --> 02:07:57.806]  So, the one thing people need to do that took the death shot, they need to repent that they were relying on the world and not on the wisdom that God gives you.
[02:07:57.806 --> 02:07:59.887]  They need to repent for that mistake.
[02:07:59.887 --> 02:08:02.448]  Now, when they do, they'll start to see miracles.
[02:08:02.448 --> 02:08:09.091]  You know, I have a ministry, Jesus Christ Worldwide Ministries, jcwm1.com, if anybody needs prayer.
[02:08:09.091 --> 02:08:13.713]  But I've seen miracles, Alex, and people need to admit they're wrong.
[02:08:13.713 --> 02:08:14.513]  They need to repent.
[02:08:15.504 --> 02:08:19.685]  And then they become, in a sense, quantumly entangled with Christ.
[02:08:19.685 --> 02:08:24.546]  And now all of these weapons that are formed against us won't prosper.
[02:08:24.546 --> 02:08:26.106]  And I want to say this fast.
[02:08:26.106 --> 02:08:30.567]  I, too, if I had the ability to go into the wilderness, I would want to, too.
[02:08:30.567 --> 02:08:37.109]  But it only takes a $4,000 DJI drone to crop dust your house in a couple years, and you won't have a crop.
[02:08:37.737 --> 02:08:39.778]  There will be nowhere to hide.
[02:08:39.778 --> 02:08:41.859]  Let me just say this, earlier I wanted to make that point.
[02:08:41.859 --> 02:08:43.460]  I think we need a two-pronged attack.
[02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:46.621]  Women and children, women want to come fight with us, that's great.
[02:08:46.621 --> 02:08:54.766]  In the country as a backup, but we have to go into the city and we have to fight the tyranny and expose the New World Order and warn people at the same time.
[02:08:54.766 --> 02:08:58.027]  I absolutely understand what you're saying, God bless you.
[02:08:58.027 --> 02:09:00.128]  Really great callers.
[02:09:00.128 --> 02:09:01.529]  Rick and Matt, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:09:03.795 --> 02:09:10.240]  Yeah, hey Alex, I have a few points that I just want to finish about products actually.
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:22.128]  So, number one, Trump, I mean at this point, I've always been a big supporter of Trump, but at this point his ignorance is becoming dangerous, I think.
[02:09:22.128 --> 02:09:24.950]  Because basically at this point we have enough information
[02:09:25.857 --> 02:09:30.381]  There's enough information out there to know that these shots are dangerous.
[02:09:30.381 --> 02:09:34.284]  If those shots fall, I feel like everything falls.
[02:09:34.284 --> 02:09:50.897]  At that point, if everybody knew that these shots are dangerous and the governments have been allowing them to be put in people's arms, obviously at that point people kind of know that they definitely don't have our best interest in mind.
[02:09:50.897 --> 02:09:51.438]  Secondly,
[02:09:52.757 --> 02:10:10.131]  When it comes to food, food supplies, things like that, I believe that when it comes to food in general, even though right now you have stocked shelves and all that stuff, that doesn't necessarily, you're still not getting what you need out of the food.
[02:10:10.131 --> 02:10:11.492]  Most of the grounds are depleted.
[02:10:12.276 --> 02:10:16.778]  And you're really not getting anything out of the foods that you're eating.
[02:10:16.778 --> 02:10:26.963]  So that's why I heard your new commercial about that 99% of people essentially aren't buying or supplementing, aren't buying products from InfoWars.
[02:10:26.963 --> 02:10:29.964]  That's crazy to me because your integrity is through the roof.
[02:10:29.964 --> 02:10:31.425]  You've told us the truth about everything.
[02:10:31.425 --> 02:10:32.846]  I've been listening to you over 20 years.
[02:10:33.406 --> 02:10:34.427]  I have all the coins.
[02:10:34.427 --> 02:10:36.408]  I have the art piece.
[02:10:36.408 --> 02:10:37.228]  I have all of it.
[02:10:37.228 --> 02:10:38.669]  I buy many products.
[02:10:38.669 --> 02:10:39.850]  Fusion.
[02:10:39.850 --> 02:10:42.031]  You're the reason we're on air.
[02:10:42.031 --> 02:10:44.573]  It's not like you guys are the tail.
[02:10:44.573 --> 02:10:49.696]  You're the head, the body, the legs, the brain, the guts, the blood, the sweat.
[02:10:49.696 --> 02:10:50.716]  You're the whole animal.
[02:10:54.465 --> 02:11:00.372]  This is a composite here of all of us that want freedom coming together, and you're absolutely right.
[02:11:00.372 --> 02:11:07.582]  The supplements are the highest quality out there, and it does keep us on air, and God keeps me honest here, keeping us treading water.
[02:11:07.582 --> 02:11:12.388]  But absolutely, the people really should be taking the supplements we have.
[02:11:13.613 --> 02:11:24.695]  Yeah, I just don't understand knowing that anybody who's been listening to your show for years knows that the food supply is depleted as far as what we're getting out of it.
[02:11:24.695 --> 02:11:25.715]  They know all these things.
[02:11:25.715 --> 02:11:32.456]  Well, if people only took one thing, it'd be our Deep Earth Crystal Pure Iodide.
[02:11:32.456 --> 02:11:33.056]  That's sold out.
[02:11:33.056 --> 02:11:33.516]  We don't have it.
[02:11:33.516 --> 02:11:37.577]  It's not back for six weeks, but all of it is over the top.
[02:11:37.577 --> 02:11:39.778]  But anybody in winters should be taking vitamin D3.
[02:11:39.778 --> 02:11:40.998]  Ours is high quality.
[02:11:40.998 --> 02:11:42.138]  Wherever you get it, folks, get it.
[02:11:43.542 --> 02:11:44.964]  It's essential to everything.
[02:11:44.964 --> 02:11:48.106]  But real quick, I appreciate you, Rick, plugging the products.
[02:11:48.106 --> 02:11:50.168]  You wanted to talk about the next pandemic.
[02:11:50.168 --> 02:11:51.890]  I see that on screen.
[02:11:51.890 --> 02:12:06.043]  Yeah, so lastly, basically, I feel as though with the mind control, the fact that they were able to get everybody in a position, that they were so scared, they were willing to hear, do anything, mask up, double mask, all these things.
[02:12:06.761 --> 02:12:09.123]  That was all based on information.
[02:12:09.123 --> 02:12:16.150]  That was all based on the fact that we didn't have all the information we needed on what coronavirus was, what this was.
[02:12:16.150 --> 02:12:24.537]  Everything that was coming out of China showed, oh, there's people laid out in the middle of the street, and they're having convulsions.
[02:12:24.537 --> 02:12:27.200]  Oh, that was definitely a sign to get us scared.
[02:12:28.462 --> 02:12:29.202]  Absolutely.
[02:12:29.202 --> 02:12:34.725]  But the fact of the matter is, now at this point, we didn't have the SPARS document then.
[02:12:34.725 --> 02:12:37.206]  We had it after the pandemic was started.
[02:12:37.206 --> 02:12:40.228]  We do have the Endurovirus one now.
[02:12:40.228 --> 02:12:44.690]  And the Endurovirus one, which is the new war game that they're talking about.
[02:12:44.690 --> 02:12:48.252]  At this point, my point is, what if McCullough or
[02:12:52.570 --> 02:13:07.583]  I totally agree, and that's been my plan, is to instead of just talking about what happened and what's currently happening, get back to our roots of what's going to happen, and that's my main focus, and I'm in deep research to do it, but I agree with you.
[02:13:07.583 --> 02:13:10.045]  We should be telling people what we believe is coming next.
[02:13:10.045 --> 02:13:15.270]  That for me, though, is heavy to do, and I'm really trying to do my best job, brother, but we're going to do that.
[02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.931]  I totally agree with you.
[02:13:16.451 --> 02:13:20.634]  I'm going to talk to a lot of the top leaders in the fight and impress on them.
[02:13:20.634 --> 02:13:24.356]  We should try to predict what's coming next so that we're not caught flat-footed.
[02:13:24.356 --> 02:13:24.996]  Amazing points.
[02:13:24.996 --> 02:13:25.697]  Thank you.
[02:13:25.697 --> 02:13:27.978]  Kyle and then Kathy and then Kim.
[02:13:27.978 --> 02:13:29.519]  Kyle in Nebraska.
[02:13:29.519 --> 02:13:31.520]  Go ahead.
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:34.222]  Alex, the art of war Jones.
[02:13:34.222 --> 02:13:35.663]  Love you, brother.
[02:13:35.663 --> 02:13:37.304]  Love you.
[02:13:37.304 --> 02:13:38.124]  All right.
[02:13:38.124 --> 02:13:41.406]  I got to bring this up.
[02:13:41.406 --> 02:13:43.748]  You got guys like me everywhere that are check to check.
[02:13:44.611 --> 02:13:48.452]  And still find a way to buy supplements because they're the best in the world.
[02:13:48.452 --> 02:13:50.253]  And we're sitting here check to check.
[02:13:50.253 --> 02:13:55.555]  There's thousands of us, maybe hundreds of thousands in this country, just like me.
[02:13:55.555 --> 02:13:59.776]  But you get Joe Rogan talking to Lex Friedman.
[02:13:59.776 --> 02:14:03.978]  And you guys, please, please bring this clip up when you can.
[02:14:03.978 --> 02:14:05.258]  It's a short clip.
[02:14:05.258 --> 02:14:11.420]  And it's Joe Rogan refusing to have Trump on his podcast with Lex Friedman.
[02:14:11.420 --> 02:14:12.781]  And it's just disgusting.
[02:14:13.815 --> 02:14:26.307]  What Joe Rogan said and it's just we got to call these people out man and just and just all you know just all assault like it's ridiculous man just to see that kind of stuff you know?
[02:14:26.932 --> 02:14:48.548]  I haven't seen the clip and I tell you when Joe first moved here we were hanging out quite often and Joe's very nice if I call him up you know we can go get dinner or whatever and I've just kind of I talked to Joe on the phone some he's we talk on text every day but I just you know he did some good work exposing the shot but then it's almost like I'm seeing backtracking from him and
[02:14:49.639 --> 02:14:51.340]  Just a lot of weird stuff going on.
[02:14:51.340 --> 02:15:00.507]  And I just, you know, I've got bigger fish to fry, like the New World Order and the Globalists, and so I'm not going to be the keeper.
[02:15:00.507 --> 02:15:02.008]  I'm not my brother's keeper.
[02:15:02.008 --> 02:15:06.872]  I'm not going to sit there and tell Joe what to do or try to put pressure on him.
[02:15:06.872 --> 02:15:12.216]  But I mean, I haven't really... What did Lex Friedman say?
[02:15:12.216 --> 02:15:15.358]  Basically, he was being more centrist.
[02:15:16.175 --> 02:15:22.737]  And saying, well, what's the if you're so scared of what he represents or where the country is going to go?
[02:15:22.737 --> 02:15:26.378]  Why don't you shine a light and have him on your podcast?
[02:15:26.378 --> 02:15:35.801]  And he goes, because I'm worried that that will influence where the country goes down the road, as if the country isn't off the frickin track.
[02:15:35.801 --> 02:15:40.182]  And as if Trump is way, way worse or something than than than these treasonous
[02:15:41.058 --> 02:15:41.598]  Democrats?
[02:15:41.598 --> 02:15:44.119]  I mean, it's just... I just don't understand.
[02:15:44.119 --> 02:15:45.359]  I didn't watch that podcast.
[02:15:45.359 --> 02:15:52.301]  I know he said nice things about me on there, but I... Look, I mean, I think Joe is trying to be neutral, but that's lukewarm.
[02:15:52.301 --> 02:15:54.362]  Sometimes neutral is being in the middle of the road.
[02:15:54.362 --> 02:15:58.323]  I appreciate your call.
[02:15:58.323 --> 02:16:02.904]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing Infowars?
[02:16:02.904 --> 02:16:05.185]  Attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:08.031]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[02:16:08.031 --> 02:16:09.731]  They know we're telling the truth.
[02:16:09.731 --> 02:16:11.312]  They know we've got their number.
[02:16:11.312 --> 02:16:16.033]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[02:16:16.033 --> 02:16:23.896]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[02:16:23.896 --> 02:16:34.299]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds like preglanone and so much more to supercharge your body.
[02:16:35.302 --> 02:16:35.602]  Thank you.
[02:16:59.411 --> 02:17:04.194]  Cobra Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[02:17:04.194 --> 02:17:12.099]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[02:17:12.099 --> 02:17:15.621]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[02:17:15.621 --> 02:17:24.187]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the curve.
[02:17:24.987 --> 02:17:32.889]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at megacorporations.
[02:17:32.889 --> 02:17:43.312]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[02:17:43.312 --> 02:17:46.073]  You will then be my slaves.
[02:17:46.073 --> 02:17:46.253]  Only.
[02:17:46.833 --> 02:17:50.837]  And then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[02:17:50.837 --> 02:17:56.762]  It will improve your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[02:17:57.898 --> 02:18:07.904]  The good news is the Real Red Pill Plus, after over two years being sold out because the key ingredients were unavailable with supply chain breakdowns, is finally back in stock in the last month.
[02:18:07.904 --> 02:18:11.626]  The bad news is we need a limited run of it and it's almost sold out.
[02:18:11.626 --> 02:18:13.988]  So, we're in late January when I'm cutting this.
[02:18:13.988 --> 02:18:19.071]  Only seven days left to get the Real Red Pill Plus with all the key ingredients like preglanone and more
[02:18:19.471 --> 02:18:20.172]  We're good to go.
[02:18:44.932 --> 02:18:48.537]  You need to try the Real Red Pill Plus right now, plus it funds the InfoWar.
[02:18:48.537 --> 02:18:50.459]  The only way we fail is if we don't take action.
[02:18:50.459 --> 02:18:55.787]  Real Red Pill Plus, now available at 50% off at InfoWarStore.com for only a few more days.
[02:18:57.739 --> 02:18:59.741]  InfoWars has made history.
[02:18:59.741 --> 02:19:02.365]  You have made history by supporting InfoWars.
[02:19:02.365 --> 02:19:05.548]  The globalists are being defeated on every front.
[02:19:05.548 --> 02:19:08.992]  And now is the time to not just sit on our laurels because we're winning battles.
[02:19:08.992 --> 02:19:10.554]  Let's win the war.
[02:19:10.554 --> 02:19:12.316]  The information war.
[02:19:12.316 --> 02:19:17.102]  There's nothing you can do more important than keeping InfoWars on air and the fight for liberty.
[02:19:17.102 --> 02:19:18.904]  I don't think anybody denies that fact.
[02:19:19.164 --> 02:19:33.273]  And I thank you for your past support, but I'm encouraging you now to get one of the very last coins in a four-coin series, the Teddy Roosevelt Man of the Arena coin, exclusively at 1776coin.com.

[02:19:59.427 --> 02:20:05.330]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:11.372 --> 02:20:14.114]  You got it, got it.
[02:20:14.114 --> 02:20:16.495]  This transmission's coming to you.
[02:20:16.495 --> 02:20:22.378]  I'll make you uncomfortable.
[02:20:22.378 --> 02:20:25.300]  I'll make you uncomfortable.
[02:20:28.694 --> 02:20:32.457]  This transmission's coming to you.
[02:20:32.457 --> 02:20:34.459]  This transmission's coming to you.
[02:20:34.459 --> 02:20:37.341]  That's a true statement.
[02:20:37.341 --> 02:20:39.463]  This transmission's coming to you.
[02:20:39.463 --> 02:20:40.243]  You got it.
[02:20:40.243 --> 02:20:41.084]  You are GOAT.
[02:20:58.353 --> 02:21:01.835]  Alright, I'm going to go back to your phone calls, over-the-top incredible calls.
[02:21:01.835 --> 02:21:03.836]  I'm just humbled to talk to such amazing people.
[02:21:03.836 --> 02:21:08.879]  I'm going to say this very briefly because callers don't need to call in and talk about how great the supplements are and I appreciate you doing it.
[02:21:08.879 --> 02:21:10.540]  If you want to do it, that's fine.
[02:21:10.540 --> 02:21:11.241]  But I'll just say this.
[02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:14.111]  Nothing's better than clean water.
[02:21:14.111 --> 02:21:15.992]  Nothing's better than sunshine.
[02:21:15.992 --> 02:21:18.593]  Nothing's better than good leafy green vegetables out of the garden.
[02:21:18.593 --> 02:21:19.814]  Everybody knows that.
[02:21:19.814 --> 02:21:26.598]  But they want to give us these shots to lower our immune systems, show what they're going to roll out can hurt us and kill us.
[02:21:26.598 --> 02:21:35.423]  And so that's why high quality, pure, top of the line supplements, whether it's nitric oxide boost for your body, or whether it's vitamin mineral fusion,
[02:21:36.443 --> 02:21:36.563]  Well, I
[02:21:55.230 --> 02:21:57.554]  About seven, eight years ago, I was like, well, what do people like?
[02:21:57.554 --> 02:21:58.215]  What's top rated?
[02:21:58.215 --> 02:22:05.628]  Well, they like chicken broth, concentrates, boost immune system, great for your bones, great for your cartilage, great for your back, everything.
[02:22:05.628 --> 02:22:07.190]  So I said, well, what do the top sellers have?
[02:22:08.126 --> 02:22:13.850]  Well, the very best top sellers have turmeric, and chaga mushroom, and bee pollen, and goji berry, and a bunch of other stuff.
[02:22:13.850 --> 02:22:17.452]  And I said, okay, we'll just make it stronger and put the highest quality in.
[02:22:17.452 --> 02:22:20.754]  So I can say hands down, we don't have no other brand as good as this.
[02:22:20.754 --> 02:22:31.461]  Regular bone broth of this quality costs the same as this, without all the added wonderful stuff to it, like turmeric, and alfalfa, and all the rest of it.

[02:22:39.602 --> 02:22:41.383]  Again, infowarestore.com.
[02:22:41.383 --> 02:22:44.564]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls now.
[02:22:44.564 --> 02:22:46.044]  Let's go to Kathy and then Kim.
[02:22:46.044 --> 02:22:47.505]  Kathy, thank you for holding patiently.
[02:22:47.505 --> 02:22:48.305]  I really appreciate that.
[02:22:48.305 --> 02:22:50.586]  Go ahead.
[02:22:50.586 --> 02:22:52.066]  Oh, dear, dear Alex.
[02:22:52.066 --> 02:23:02.750]  I will never, ever give up and God has tested me this week and yesterday I was your last caller and the line got dropped ten minutes before you took me on.
[02:23:02.750 --> 02:23:03.890]  Well, I apologize for that.
[02:23:03.890 --> 02:23:04.830]  Go ahead.
[02:23:04.830 --> 02:23:06.511]  No, I'm sure it wasn't your fault.
[02:23:10.453 --> 02:23:16.417]  I've been laser focused on two things, saving children and crushing big pharma.
[02:23:16.417 --> 02:23:17.558]  Beautiful.
[02:23:17.558 --> 02:23:30.426]  And I had a dream, an idea on this past Sunday and I put it out there and I've had comments and people think I'm off my nut, but here it goes.
[02:23:30.426 --> 02:23:38.071]  It doesn't cost anybody in America a dime and no electricity or gas needed.
[02:23:38.071 --> 02:23:39.692]  All communities, neighborhoods,
[02:23:40.855 --> 02:24:08.739]  Starting with America, let's step up to the plate and show America's got some guts and wanting to save the children on having a candlelight vigil in your neighborhood, communities, and all over the world on February 12th, the day of the sponsored by Pfizer NFL game.
[02:24:09.904 --> 02:24:16.272]  Let's put down the beer and whatever and get out there and send a message to this world.
[02:24:16.272 --> 02:24:22.601]  We're not going to take it anymore with these bioweapons shots going into babies and children.
[02:24:23.476 --> 02:24:24.677]  You know, that's a great idea.
[02:24:24.677 --> 02:24:33.042]  Candlelight vigils are very powerful, especially if you go to city councils or capitals, if you live near a capital, and get a few of your friends and have a candlelight vigil.
[02:24:33.042 --> 02:24:34.303]  People ask, why are you here?
[02:24:34.303 --> 02:24:39.266]  We're here for the dead and dying from the poison shots that Fauci and Bill Gates launched against us.
[02:24:39.266 --> 02:24:39.806]  I agree with you.
[02:24:39.806 --> 02:24:46.010]  We should have candlelight vigils for the January 6th political presidents, because if we don't stand up for them, we're next.
[02:24:46.010 --> 02:24:47.491]  That is a great idea.
[02:24:47.491 --> 02:24:50.433]  But let me show, I tell you what, I won't forget this.
[02:24:51.992 --> 02:24:55.755]  I mean, where do we do the candlelight vigils?
[02:24:55.755 --> 02:24:57.496]  Sunday the 12th.
[02:24:57.496 --> 02:24:59.298]  The hell with the ballgames.
[02:24:59.298 --> 02:25:01.039]  Who the hell cares about a ballgame?
[02:25:01.039 --> 02:25:03.321]  Did they have them during the lockdown?
[02:25:03.321 --> 02:25:04.882]  No, ma'am, I agree with you.
[02:25:04.882 --> 02:25:07.364]  Where would you do the candlelight vigils?
[02:25:07.364 --> 02:25:08.685]  In your neighborhood.
[02:25:08.685 --> 02:25:11.367]  Take your little kid, give him a little candle.
[02:25:11.367 --> 02:25:14.430]  Who doesn't have matches and candles in their home right now?
[02:25:15.322 --> 02:25:22.011]  No, it's a great way to draw attention and then walk the dog up the street a few times and ask, why do you have a candlelight vigil?
[02:25:22.011 --> 02:25:23.773]  And say it's for all the dead and dying from the shots.
[02:25:23.773 --> 02:25:25.155]  It's a great way to reach out.
[02:25:25.155 --> 02:25:26.337]  It's a great way to get attention.
[02:25:26.337 --> 02:25:32.505]  And then if you have an Instagram or Facebook or Rumble account, you know, do mainstream and also Patriot.
[02:25:33.186 --> 02:25:35.146]  Shoot a video with your candlelight vigil.
[02:25:35.146 --> 02:25:37.587]  Or just shoot a video lighting a candle in your house.
[02:25:37.587 --> 02:25:38.767]  Put it out in cyberspace.
[02:25:38.767 --> 02:25:41.728]  I would do it physically and I would do it in cyberspace.
[02:25:41.728 --> 02:25:43.928]  That is a beautiful idea, Kathy.
[02:25:43.928 --> 02:25:44.909]  Thank you for the call.
[02:25:44.909 --> 02:25:45.889]  Amazing.
[02:25:45.889 --> 02:25:49.710]  Kim in Wisconsin, go ahead.
[02:25:49.710 --> 02:25:51.390]  Love you.
[02:25:51.390 --> 02:25:53.710]  I have a few quick things.
[02:25:53.710 --> 02:25:54.491]  I'll speak quickly.
[02:25:54.491 --> 02:25:55.231]  One is AI.
[02:25:56.815 --> 02:26:02.139]  How they condition us on the complete season number 11 of the X-Files.
[02:26:02.139 --> 02:26:08.903]  Show RM9SBG93ZWJZ.
[02:26:08.903 --> 02:26:13.566]  It starts out and it says if we do not control AI, it will control us.
[02:26:13.566 --> 02:26:17.008]  I believe the answer to how to control AI is probably in that show.
[02:26:17.008 --> 02:26:19.110]  I'll be watching it tonight.
[02:26:19.110 --> 02:26:19.930]  Two more points.
[02:26:19.930 --> 02:26:22.312]  One is about robots and another is
[02:26:22.870 --> 02:26:26.392]  You do have soldiers out there right now on the streets.
[02:26:26.392 --> 02:26:33.097]  Ron Benghazi, um, Tundland has four days ago, has a video right now.
[02:26:33.097 --> 02:26:34.498]  He's been doing it for weeks.
[02:26:34.498 --> 02:26:39.922]  He's out protesting against the drag Queens and children's museum.
[02:26:39.922 --> 02:26:43.504]  And there's an info wars banner there and everything.
[02:26:43.504 --> 02:26:51.570]  And, um, the other thing is Elon Musk and 29 Japanese scientists.
[02:26:52.330 --> 02:26:56.252]  A few years back, supposedly, we were killed by four robots.
[02:26:56.252 --> 02:26:59.773]  We need to make robots like that illegal.
[02:26:59.773 --> 02:27:08.457]  We need to start making things illegal and standing up for it, because otherwise, we're in trouble.
[02:27:08.457 --> 02:27:09.278]  I agree with you.
[02:27:09.278 --> 02:27:12.219]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:27:12.219 --> 02:27:14.640]  Yes, I have an idea for a t-shirt.
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:18.702]  It's Norman Bates was and is psycho.
[02:27:21.443 --> 02:27:23.204]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[02:27:23.204 --> 02:27:24.906]  Alright, let's jam in one more before we go to break.
[02:27:24.906 --> 02:27:28.789]  Let's go to Burt in Arizona.
[02:27:28.789 --> 02:27:30.891]  Yes, Alex, am I coming through?
[02:27:30.891 --> 02:27:31.151]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:34.561]  Hey, so, well, you said it about five minutes ago.
[02:27:34.561 --> 02:27:35.341]  What's coming next?
[02:27:35.341 --> 02:27:36.141]  That's what's important.
[02:27:36.141 --> 02:27:36.501]  Guess what?
[02:27:36.501 --> 02:27:42.663]  The Bible foretold 2,500 years ago exactly what's coming next year.
[02:27:42.663 --> 02:27:45.564]  Biden will not be nominated by the Democrats in 2024.
[02:27:45.564 --> 02:27:52.726]  He will be taken out by the deep state during the election season, August to September 2024.
[02:27:52.726 --> 02:27:56.307]  Immediately after that, both of the candidates, the Republican and Democrats,
[02:27:58.028 --> 02:28:05.435]  Hold on, I'm getting chills right now, and I want you to stop right there, and I want you to come back.
[02:28:05.435 --> 02:28:10.239]  Don't hang up, okay?
[02:28:10.239 --> 02:28:15.544]  My mother never gets in my face about politics.
[02:28:16.482 --> 02:28:17.923]  But she's extremely smart.
[02:28:17.923 --> 02:28:19.203]  And I'm not trying to act cool.
[02:28:19.203 --> 02:28:20.044]  Everybody's psychic.
[02:28:20.044 --> 02:28:21.504]  Everybody has a sixth sense.
[02:28:21.504 --> 02:28:22.625]  Most people aren't aware of it.
[02:28:22.625 --> 02:28:25.646]  But my mother's side of the family is extremely psychic.
[02:28:25.646 --> 02:28:26.427]  So is my dad's.
[02:28:26.427 --> 02:28:28.708]  It's kind of a little family secret.
[02:28:28.708 --> 02:28:30.949]  But her grandmother was actually a...
[02:28:31.989 --> 02:28:36.892]  Down low, famous psychic that even a US president came to see.
[02:28:36.892 --> 02:28:40.234]  We're not talking about like a gypsy on the side of the road in a cart or something, okay?
[02:28:40.234 --> 02:28:45.577]  But my mom got the touch.
[02:28:45.577 --> 02:28:48.859]  And she said, I'm going to tell you when we come back.
[02:28:48.859 --> 02:28:50.140]  She's grabbed me and told me this.
[02:28:50.140 --> 02:28:52.241]  She says they're going to kill him.
[02:28:59.147 --> 02:29:02.310]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:29:02.310 --> 02:29:04.592]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:29:04.592 --> 02:29:08.536]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:29:08.536 --> 02:29:17.464]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:29:17.464 --> 02:29:25.251]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:29:26.272 --> 02:29:29.153]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:29:29.153 --> 02:29:35.695]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:29:35.695 --> 02:29:38.736]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:29:38.736 --> 02:29:45.778]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[02:29:45.778 --> 02:29:46.958]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[02:29:47.658 --> 02:29:51.980]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:29:51.980 --> 02:29:56.923]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWareStore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:29:56.923 --> 02:29:58.144]  Please take action now.
[02:29:58.144 --> 02:30:07.489]  The good news is the real Red Pill Plus, after over two years being sold out because the key ingredients were unavailable with supply chain breakdowns, is finally back in stock in the last month.
[02:30:08.129 --> 02:30:11.853]  The bad news is we need a limited run of it and it's almost sold out.
[02:30:11.853 --> 02:30:14.216]  So, we're in late January when I'm cutting this.
[02:30:14.216 --> 02:30:21.805]  Only seven days left to get the Real Red Pill Plus with all the key ingredients like preglanone and more at InfoWarsTore.com for 50% off.
[02:30:23.086 --> 02:30:25.987]  Whether you're old or young, black or white, it doesn't matter.
[02:30:25.987 --> 02:30:28.788]  You need to experience Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:30:28.788 --> 02:30:30.109]  It's proprietary.
[02:30:30.109 --> 02:30:30.769]  It's amazing.
[02:30:30.769 --> 02:30:36.091]  I learned about it from a research scientist and a medical doctor who had a similar formula five years ago.
[02:30:36.091 --> 02:30:39.213]  We simply made it stronger and we have great reviews from listeners.
[02:30:39.213 --> 02:30:41.593]  Get the Real Red Pill Plus for a limited time.
[02:30:41.593 --> 02:30:45.155]  It's about to end at InfoWareStore.com for 50% off.
[02:30:45.155 --> 02:30:47.276]  You need to try the Real Red Pill Plus right now.
[02:30:47.276 --> 02:30:48.756]  Plus it funds the InfoWare.
[02:30:48.756 --> 02:30:50.677]  The only way we fail is if we don't take action.
[02:30:50.677 --> 02:30:52.378]  Real Red Pill Plus, now available.
[02:30:52.858 --> 02:30:53.359]  We're good.
[02:30:58.166 --> 02:31:01.208]  InfoWars' secret weapon is finally here.
[02:31:01.208 --> 02:31:09.554]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life, for your libido, and it also keeps InfoWars on the air.
[02:31:09.554 --> 02:31:19.100]  And I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[02:31:19.100 --> 02:31:24.564]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[02:31:24.564 --> 02:31:27.266]  They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner's a listener,
[02:31:27.506 --> 02:31:29.927]  We're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[02:31:29.927 --> 02:31:35.109]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high-quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[02:31:35.109 --> 02:31:37.471]  You're not going to find it at the 10 milligram or the 20 milligram.
[02:31:37.471 --> 02:31:41.252]  You're not going to find tumor hit 95% humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[02:31:41.252 --> 02:31:43.914]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[02:31:43.914 --> 02:31:50.016]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[02:31:50.016 --> 02:31:54.398]  InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:54.398 --> 02:31:55.079]  A true 360 win.
[02:31:57.924 --> 02:32:04.089]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war.
[02:32:04.089 --> 02:32:17.080]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting Infowarstore.com right now and taking action.
[02:32:17.080 --> 02:32:22.024]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[02:32:22.284 --> 02:32:26.388]  To keep InfoWars on the air, we'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[02:32:26.388 --> 02:32:27.850]  They're coming for you and your family.
[02:32:27.850 --> 02:32:29.091]  They're coming for me.
[02:32:29.091 --> 02:32:30.332]  They're coming for the children.
[02:32:30.332 --> 02:32:32.915]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[02:32:32.915 --> 02:32:36.278]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[02:32:36.278 --> 02:32:37.840]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[02:32:37.840 --> 02:32:39.942]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[02:32:39.942 --> 02:32:44.967]  80-plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two trimesters after these poison shots.
[02:32:45.347 --> 02:32:49.268]  We can and will save the children, and they are counting on us.
[02:32:49.268 --> 02:32:50.489]  Let's do it together.
[02:32:50.489 --> 02:32:52.770]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[02:32:52.770 --> 02:32:56.591]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:56.591 --> 02:32:59.372]  Now take action now!
[02:32:59.372 --> 02:33:05.274]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.857 --> 02:33:27.305]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.305 --> 02:33:35.991]  So I go over to my parents' house probably every two weeks for dinner with my wife and my five-year-old child and my older children come over to visit usually, same time.
[02:33:35.991 --> 02:33:44.017]  And it was about two years ago, Biden had only been a few months, and I'm sitting there, my mother goes, they're going to kill Biden.
[02:33:45.384 --> 02:33:53.889]  They're going to kill Biden in the next couple of years and before he announces for 2024 and use that as a false flag to bring in massive tyranny.
[02:33:53.889 --> 02:33:54.890]  She goes, I just see it.
[02:33:54.890 --> 02:33:56.031]  I just know it.
[02:33:56.031 --> 02:33:59.333]  You got to tell people and we got to stop it.
[02:33:59.333 --> 02:34:06.497]  And you got to make sure people are nonviolent and you got to get out ahead of this and say that you don't support Biden being killed, which I do not.
[02:34:06.497 --> 02:34:08.138]  Turns him into a martyr.
[02:34:08.138 --> 02:34:10.820]  And call it a sense, women's intuition.
[02:34:10.820 --> 02:34:11.780]  We all know about it.
[02:34:11.780 --> 02:34:14.142]  I mean, here's an example the other day, and this happens all the time.
[02:34:14.980 --> 02:34:17.861]  Whenever I don't try, I can do it.
[02:34:17.861 --> 02:34:26.746]  I can be in a dark bedroom, I don't have an alarm clock with a big light on it, I have my watch sitting right next to me, and I can turn my phone on and do it.
[02:34:26.746 --> 02:34:33.389]  I don't try, and everybody has these experiences, I don't try, I always know the exact minute it is when I wake up.
[02:34:33.389 --> 02:34:36.750]  And I might wake up at five, I might wake up at six, but I just know the minute.
[02:34:36.750 --> 02:34:38.671]  But your brain somehow knows the minute.
[02:34:38.671 --> 02:34:39.472]  You're dialed into that.
[02:34:39.472 --> 02:34:41.813]  Another example is, I'm sitting there,
[02:34:43.399 --> 02:34:50.762]  I'm on vacation with my wife and five-year-old, and my wife's in the shower getting dressed after we've been out at the beach.
[02:34:50.762 --> 02:34:52.282]  And my wife's got a deck of cards.
[02:34:52.282 --> 02:34:54.423]  She likes to play blackjack with me.
[02:34:54.423 --> 02:35:02.947]  And I get the deck, I shuffle it, and I spread it out in front of my five-year-old on the table.
[02:35:02.947 --> 02:35:06.168]  And I said, I'm going to pull the ace of spades out of this.
[02:35:06.168 --> 02:35:08.929]  And of course, it's crazy.
[02:35:08.929 --> 02:35:11.210]  Because I knew it was going to happen.
[02:35:11.210 --> 02:35:11.850]  I just looked at it.
[02:35:13.046 --> 02:35:17.245]  I went over the cards and I pulled the Ace of Spades out.
[02:35:18.697 --> 02:35:20.839]  Now that's the real power of the universe.
[02:35:20.839 --> 02:35:22.500]  And you've all got that as well.
[02:35:22.500 --> 02:35:25.983]  And that's what they're trying to control and subjugate in the public.
[02:35:25.983 --> 02:35:29.946]  We have our own interdimensional internet with God, the Holy Spirit.
[02:35:29.946 --> 02:35:31.087]  But it's not going to be used for evil.
[02:35:31.087 --> 02:35:32.608]  God's not going to let you do that.
[02:35:32.608 --> 02:35:35.050]  The enemy knows about that, and they're really scared of it.
[02:35:35.050 --> 02:35:39.973]  And that's what the Pentagon found in their big mind control test they did under General Stubblebine.
[02:35:39.973 --> 02:35:43.216]  And that's why they made movies about it, poo-pooing it, making fun of it.
[02:35:43.216 --> 02:35:48.400]  But that's actually where George Lucas, out of those secret studies, got the ideas for what he did with Star Wars and the rest of it.
[02:35:49.724 --> 02:35:57.769]  But the point is the caller called in and he's, whether he's having an intuition or he's politically seeing this, he was laying out dates, he thinks they're going to kill Biden.
[02:35:57.769 --> 02:35:59.390]  I think that's definitely in the cards.
[02:35:59.390 --> 02:36:02.132]  Start over, sir.
[02:36:02.132 --> 02:36:04.553]  So, hey, it's not just a conspiracy theory, Alex.
[02:36:04.553 --> 02:36:11.798]  When it's in the scriptures, I'm saying it's been there for 2,500 years, hidden in plain sight to be deciphered only in our time.
[02:36:11.798 --> 02:36:12.478]  It only makes sense.
[02:36:12.478 --> 02:36:15.920]  You know, when you see the pieces stack up, A, B, C, you go, I know what's coming next.
[02:36:15.920 --> 02:36:16.681]  There it is.
[02:36:16.681 --> 02:36:18.862]  Those those other pieces finally make sense.
[02:36:19.202 --> 02:36:21.845]  And only in the last fiscal of years has this become clear.
[02:36:21.845 --> 02:36:23.286]  We all know the Book of Revelation.
[02:36:23.286 --> 02:36:24.447]  We all know the Daniel.
[02:36:24.447 --> 02:36:26.509]  Those two pieces hold together pretty good.
[02:36:26.509 --> 02:36:26.810]  Guess what?
[02:36:26.810 --> 02:36:29.452]  There's one more piece that's in the Apocrypha.
[02:36:29.452 --> 02:36:35.258]  It's a prophecy to the prophet Ezra in Daniel's time.
[02:36:35.258 --> 02:36:40.363]  And it's about an eagle, and that eagle represents presidential catch-me-on-this.
[02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:51.278]  Presidential succession in the United States of America during the last 100 years leading up to the Antichrist taking over the United States.
[02:36:51.278 --> 02:36:52.819]  Okay, and you go, hey, well, you're kidding.
[02:36:52.819 --> 02:36:59.064]  I mean, if it's that clear, how would something stand out in this perfectly delineated presidential succession?
[02:36:59.064 --> 02:37:01.386]  Yes, FDR stands out.
[02:37:01.386 --> 02:37:04.849]  JFK, the removal of JFK, the removal of Nixon.
[02:37:05.532 --> 02:37:06.053]  And guess what?
[02:37:06.053 --> 02:37:09.158]  This became clear in 2015.
[02:37:09.158 --> 02:37:10.921]  That's when this information became clear.
[02:37:11.952 --> 02:37:19.773]  And in 2015, it was easily interpreted at that moment that Obama would fulfill his term, but whomever is going to be next is going to be taken out by the deep state.
[02:37:19.773 --> 02:37:20.594]  That was known in 2015.
[02:37:20.594 --> 02:37:28.515]  Hey, I'm saying I'm thinking, sure, if it's if it's Hillary, take her, you know, but if it's Trump, I'm just not going to believe this.
[02:37:28.515 --> 02:37:29.655]  I'm not going to believe it.
[02:37:29.655 --> 02:37:30.695]  But guess what?
[02:37:30.695 --> 02:37:36.196]  We sit here and lament every single day about how Trump was taken out by the deep state through a false election.
[02:37:36.196 --> 02:37:39.317]  That is a fulfillment of prophecy.
[02:37:39.317 --> 02:37:39.797]  What's next?
[02:37:40.393 --> 02:37:44.275]  Biden will be taken out by the Deep State.
[02:37:44.275 --> 02:37:48.156]  And now, there's some vital information in this prophecy that makes it clear.
[02:37:48.156 --> 02:37:56.460]  Because with each step in the succession, this is, by the way, Apocrypha, the book of 2nd Esdras, chapters 11 and 12.
[02:37:56.460 --> 02:37:57.720]  Look it up, please.
[02:37:57.720 --> 02:37:58.280]  YouTube it.
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:00.341]  Go ahead and finish your point.
[02:38:00.341 --> 02:38:01.221]  I'm listening.
[02:38:01.221 --> 02:38:02.202]  Okay.
[02:38:02.202 --> 02:38:02.882]  Okay.
[02:38:02.882 --> 02:38:04.623]  Is that when Biden is removed,
[02:38:05.626 --> 02:38:12.730]  That there are two others who are ready to take his place in every other point of succession during this hundred years.
[02:38:12.730 --> 02:38:16.152]  There's one after another, singular, singular, every single one.
[02:38:16.152 --> 02:38:20.254]  In this case, Biden is removed and two are waiting to take his place.
[02:38:20.254 --> 02:38:21.095]  Guess what?
[02:38:21.095 --> 02:38:22.275]  Election time.
[02:38:22.275 --> 02:38:27.158]  That's the only three months during the four years when there's two who are ready to take his place.
[02:38:28.539 --> 02:38:34.323]  Well, I mean, I politically, not just my mom's intuition, see them, he's workless, he's a puppet.
[02:38:34.323 --> 02:38:38.046]  How do they make a puppet blame everything on him, but make him a victim at the same time?
[02:38:38.046 --> 02:38:40.128]  They kill him and blame it on us.
[02:38:40.128 --> 02:38:41.889]  I appreciate your call.
[02:38:41.889 --> 02:38:43.690]  I'm really concerned they're going to kill Biden.
[02:38:43.690 --> 02:38:44.851]  And I hope they don't.
[02:38:44.851 --> 02:38:48.034]  Stephen Illinois, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:38:48.034 --> 02:38:48.274]  Yes.
[02:38:48.274 --> 02:38:49.635]  Hey, Alex, how are you today?
[02:38:49.635 --> 02:38:50.215]  I'm all right, brother.
[02:38:50.215 --> 02:38:51.736]  Good to talk to you.
[02:38:51.736 --> 02:38:53.438]  Hey, hey, awesome.
[02:38:53.438 --> 02:38:55.519]  Long time listener, first phone caller.
[02:38:55.519 --> 02:38:57.721]  Anyway, what I want to talk to you about is the past.
[02:38:58.528 --> 02:39:04.953]  Um, my family's name is on the most two important documents ever in this country ever existed.
[02:39:04.953 --> 02:39:07.675]  The Constitution and Declaration of Independence.
[02:39:07.675 --> 02:39:13.980]  Now, my theory is after the Civil War, this is when the death by a thousand cuts started.
[02:39:13.980 --> 02:39:21.106]  Basically, they wanted to, because after, when the South rose up, said, hey, we're not going to take your crap anymore.
[02:39:21.106 --> 02:39:25.589]  Uh, they were like, okay, we're going to, we're going to reunify and then we're going to go back and, um,
[02:39:27.597 --> 02:39:29.018]  Make sure- this never happens again.
[02:39:29.018 --> 02:39:32.980]  So, uh, that's where we're at today.
[02:39:32.980 --> 02:39:36.301]  I mean, we are at the- we're at the sphere.
[02:39:36.301 --> 02:39:39.743]  And we need you all, all rise up against this.
[02:39:39.743 --> 02:39:43.725]  Because, um, Alex, I mean, look at what they're doing to us today.
[02:39:44.335 --> 02:39:46.396]  They're putting climate change into everything.
[02:39:46.396 --> 02:39:48.317]  They are mind-controlling this.
[02:39:48.317 --> 02:39:49.718]  It's ridiculous.
[02:39:49.718 --> 02:39:50.879]  It's sad.
[02:39:50.879 --> 02:39:52.300]  It's really sad, really, what it is.
[02:39:52.300 --> 02:39:53.441]  Well, they're telling us we're bad.
[02:39:53.441 --> 02:39:58.203]  We're telling us our cows are bad, and our stoves are bad, and our gas is bad.
[02:39:58.203 --> 02:39:59.444]  That we're slaves.
[02:39:59.444 --> 02:40:01.125]  Absolutely.
[02:40:01.125 --> 02:40:04.767]  Yes, and I really appreciate what you do.
[02:40:04.767 --> 02:40:05.428]  I really appreciate it.
[02:40:05.428 --> 02:40:06.168]  Appreciate you, brother.
[02:40:06.168 --> 02:40:08.950]  I'm glad as a first-time caller you got through.
[02:40:08.950 --> 02:40:10.491]  You called it about liberals and mind control.
[02:40:11.539 --> 02:40:12.479]  Yes, actually liberals.
[02:40:12.479 --> 02:40:13.660]  Actually, I have a thing.
[02:40:13.660 --> 02:40:16.561]  Liberals ruin everything.
[02:40:16.561 --> 02:40:19.041]  That's where it comes down to.
[02:40:19.041 --> 02:40:26.283]  And liberals will mind control the heck out of you because they will... I mean, look what they're doing to the kids!
[02:40:26.283 --> 02:40:31.765]  They are indoctrinating our kids at a very young age to think like them.
[02:40:31.765 --> 02:40:34.226]  Absolutely, which is thinking against logic and common sense.
[02:40:35.359 --> 02:40:35.639]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:35.639 --> 02:40:37.420]  God bless you and your family and the Infant War crew.
[02:40:37.420 --> 02:40:37.660]  Thank you.
[02:40:37.660 --> 02:40:39.361]  Alex, you know, when I see this person hold this puppet
[02:41:05.043 --> 02:41:10.086]  It makes me so angry the way they go after our children.
[02:41:10.086 --> 02:41:16.950]  And people have got to get their children out of these schools and away from this evil that has taken
[02:41:18.263 --> 02:41:20.464]  Control of our school system.
[02:41:20.464 --> 02:41:31.386]  It's just and you're talking about North Carolina Teaching preschoolers that they're not a boy or girl that they're a it To then fast-track them into being sterilized.
[02:41:31.386 --> 02:41:42.769]  Yeah, it's absolute child abuse Just of the parents putting their school their children in a school for predators to jack with their brains exactly in in these people
[02:41:43.496 --> 02:41:46.699]  The Bible tells us to hate what is evil.
[02:41:46.699 --> 02:41:48.741]  These people are evil.
[02:41:48.741 --> 02:41:55.486]  It specifically says that homosexuality is an abomination before God.
[02:41:55.486 --> 02:41:57.188]  I'm like you.
[02:41:57.188 --> 02:41:58.989]  If you want to be gay, fine.
[02:41:58.989 --> 02:42:01.552]  If you want to be a lesbian, that's fine.
[02:42:01.552 --> 02:42:03.754]  But keep it away from our children.
[02:42:03.754 --> 02:42:07.317]  It's this simple.
[02:42:07.317 --> 02:42:11.040]  There's one word to describe all of this evil.
[02:42:11.613 --> 02:42:12.613]  It's sin.
[02:42:12.613 --> 02:42:14.154]  It's just that simple.
[02:42:14.154 --> 02:42:20.356]  A murderer murders, a robber robs, a person that's a thief steals.
[02:42:20.356 --> 02:42:23.257]  And it's just as simple as that.
[02:42:23.257 --> 02:42:25.617]  And I'm going to leave that there.
[02:42:25.617 --> 02:42:32.440]  But then we got to get back to the war and how it also ties into exactly what you're saying.
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:34.660]  We're doing the very thing that you're doing.
[02:42:34.660 --> 02:42:37.141]  I'm in the upstate of South Carolina.
[02:42:37.662 --> 02:42:40.165]  We're creating communities up here.
[02:42:40.165 --> 02:42:45.653]  We're all trying to get together, depend on each other, because that's what it's going to take.
[02:42:45.653 --> 02:42:48.056]  People need to start getting prepared.
[02:42:48.056 --> 02:42:49.598]  They need to have water filters.
[02:42:49.598 --> 02:42:51.441]  They need to have seeds.
[02:42:51.441 --> 02:42:53.243]  They need to have everything they need.
[02:42:53.243 --> 02:42:54.264]  And they need to have God.
[02:42:54.264 --> 02:42:54.765]  Thank you, Steve.
[02:42:54.765 --> 02:42:55.226]  Great points.
[02:43:06.803 --> 02:43:08.444]  Hey, what's up, Bone?
[02:43:08.444 --> 02:43:09.384]  Hey, McBreen!
[02:43:09.384 --> 02:43:11.385]  What's going on, man?
[02:43:11.385 --> 02:43:14.486]  Hey, I really like that work you did on the AI piece.
[02:43:14.486 --> 02:43:15.827]  I'm going to use that on the show today.
[02:43:15.827 --> 02:43:17.027]  Right on, I worked hard on that.
[02:43:17.027 --> 02:43:22.809]  I'm working on another project, so I'm going to be up late again tonight, and I was hoping you had some Brain Force Plus.
[02:43:22.809 --> 02:43:26.611]  Oh, um, no.
[02:43:26.611 --> 02:43:28.111]  No, nothing.
[02:43:28.111 --> 02:43:29.572]  What about Brain Force Ultra?
[02:43:35.452 --> 02:43:37.653]  No.
[02:43:37.653 --> 02:43:39.353]  Okay.
[02:43:39.353 --> 02:43:39.754]  Thanks anyway.
[02:43:39.754 --> 02:43:40.074]  Yeah.
[02:43:40.074 --> 02:43:46.456]  Good luck with that project, though.
[02:43:46.456 --> 02:43:57.981]  Get your BrainForce Plus and BrainForce Ultra right now at Inforestore.com.
[02:43:57.981 --> 02:44:03.963]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[02:44:05.262 --> 02:44:15.625]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[02:44:15.625 --> 02:44:28.368]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[02:44:29.048 --> 02:44:29.829]  We're good to go.
[02:44:58.061 --> 02:45:10.584]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[02:45:13.388 --> 02:45:23.635]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[02:45:23.635 --> 02:45:35.463]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[02:45:35.463 --> 02:45:37.004]  This is why they attack us.
[02:45:37.464 --> 02:45:40.005]  This is why we need your support.
[02:45:40.005 --> 02:45:41.806]  Because we tell the truth.
[02:45:41.806 --> 02:45:43.986]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:45:43.986 --> 02:45:45.447]  Join the resistance.
[02:45:45.447 --> 02:45:46.747]  Buy products.
[02:45:46.747 --> 02:45:48.528]  Donate to the cause.
[02:45:48.528 --> 02:45:49.908]  Share the links.
[02:45:49.908 --> 02:45:52.309]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[02:45:52.309 --> 02:45:54.510]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[02:45:57.802 --> 02:46:01.044]  InfoWars MD is finally here.
[02:46:01.044 --> 02:46:17.736]  It's the very same high quality products you've been getting through InfoWars Life, but an expanded catalog and in some cases the prices are lower because we're going directly to the source that was supplying the supplement companies that we were buying our high quality products from.
[02:46:17.736 --> 02:46:23.641]  So we're able to lower prices and bring you more products via the InfoWars MD line.

[02:47:11.522 --> 02:47:14.803]  You know, InfoWars.com starts getting updated at about 6 a.m.
[02:47:14.803 --> 02:47:20.324]  every morning, and then around 2 or 3 o'clock it gets updated again, then about 6 o'clock.
[02:47:20.324 --> 02:47:24.685]  Some of the most important stories go up at about 2 o'clock every day, and we get so busy we don't cover them.
[02:47:24.685 --> 02:47:29.287]  A whole stack of them in my hand right now are at InfoWars.com.
[02:47:29.287 --> 02:47:30.567]  I suggest you go check this out.
[02:47:32.383 --> 02:47:36.265]  But regardless, I need to go to your phone calls because that's what we're doing today and they're amazing.
[02:47:36.265 --> 02:47:38.186]  The show goes by so quick when we take calls.
[02:47:38.186 --> 02:47:39.988]  Let's go to Ferris in Florida, U.S.
[02:47:39.988 --> 02:47:42.389]  Army on nuke attacks.
[02:47:42.389 --> 02:47:44.710]  Ukraine's asking for nukes.
[02:47:44.710 --> 02:47:47.372]  Russia's massing 500,000 extra troops.
[02:47:47.372 --> 02:47:48.953]  We're headed up that threat continuum.
[02:47:48.953 --> 02:47:52.075]  Where do you see we are, Ferris, in the situation?
[02:47:53.413 --> 02:47:54.756]  Well, we're totally unprepared.
[02:47:54.756 --> 02:47:58.362]  We don't have anywhere to go if there's a nuclear, chemical, biological attack.
[02:47:58.362 --> 02:48:02.790]  Just call your local emergency management and they'll tell you to go shelter in place.
[02:48:02.790 --> 02:48:04.874]  But all our politicians have somewhere to go.
[02:48:05.526 --> 02:48:06.246]  But we don't.
[02:48:06.246 --> 02:48:25.972]  So I contacted Matt Gates, my congressman, the other day and asked him, sir, can you help us out with a tax break with whatever you can do to help your citizens be able to prepare, make, whatever it takes, their own fallout shelters like they were doing in the 50s and 60s.
[02:48:25.972 --> 02:48:28.413]  Continue.
[02:48:28.413 --> 02:48:30.293]  Well, we're just not ready.
[02:48:30.293 --> 02:48:32.374]  If people call their disaster management,
[02:48:32.884 --> 02:48:34.926]  They're going to see there's nowhere to go.
[02:48:34.926 --> 02:48:39.429]  And you can't shelter in place when, you know, when some of these things happen.
[02:48:39.429 --> 02:48:40.550]  Everyone's going to die.
[02:48:40.550 --> 02:48:44.472]  So it really bugs me that no one's doing anything to help the U.S.
[02:48:44.472 --> 02:48:47.254]  taxpayers.
[02:48:47.254 --> 02:48:47.895]  I agree with you.
[02:48:47.895 --> 02:48:49.336]  So where do you see this going?
[02:48:51.556 --> 02:49:05.924]  Well, with the way the governments around the world are pushing for war, nuclear wars, Russia and maybe China and whoever else, it's just a matter of time before someone does do it and no one really wants to do anything about it.
[02:49:05.924 --> 02:49:13.808]  They just want to keep sable rattling and it's very frustrating when no one's talking about it.
[02:49:13.808 --> 02:49:14.389]  I agree.
[02:49:14.389 --> 02:49:16.610]  Do you agree with the International Atomic
[02:49:17.625 --> 02:49:22.928]  Yeah, and it's scary because we all have family, we all have kids, we all have loved ones, and no one wants to see this go off.
[02:49:22.928 --> 02:49:23.809]  So, we're, you know, we're scared.
[02:49:37.327 --> 02:49:39.009]  I mean, yeah, everybody should be concerned.
[02:49:39.009 --> 02:49:40.690]  The problem is a lot of folks are concerned.
[02:49:40.690 --> 02:49:45.035]  A lot of leftists, like Sean Penn and others, are calling for nuclear war like it's funny.
[02:49:45.035 --> 02:49:48.278]  Don't you love how suddenly the biggest leftist anti-war, anti-U.S.
[02:49:48.278 --> 02:49:50.200]  military people now want a nuclear war?
[02:49:50.200 --> 02:49:52.022]  They're idiots!
[02:49:52.022 --> 02:49:52.662]  Yeah, it's Bacoli.
[02:49:52.662 --> 02:49:54.324]  All right, sir.
[02:49:54.324 --> 02:49:54.865]  God bless you.
[02:49:54.865 --> 02:49:55.986]  Thanks for the call.
[02:49:55.986 --> 02:49:57.347]  Obadiah in Las Vegas.
[02:49:57.347 --> 02:49:58.388]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:49:58.388 --> 02:49:59.649]  Yes, sir.
[02:50:00.942 --> 02:50:03.043]  I just wanted to get people talking about farming.
[02:50:03.043 --> 02:50:12.609]  So there is a video on YouTube of a Nebraska retiree using the Earth's heat to grow oranges in the winter.
[02:50:12.609 --> 02:50:15.551]  And in Nebraska, I guess it gets down to negative 40 degrees.
[02:50:16.417 --> 02:50:20.918]  But if you use the geothermal, and he has the plans up there as well.
[02:50:20.918 --> 02:50:31.341]  Oh, geothermal is just like hydroelectric, but even better, because everywhere, if you go down, what, a thousand feet or less, you're going to get massive heat out of the ground.
[02:50:31.341 --> 02:50:37.543]  That's why in South Africa, folks, you have the deepest mines in the world, and after about a half a mile, it starts getting super hot.
[02:50:38.621 --> 02:50:38.861]  Sure.
[02:50:38.861 --> 02:50:39.582]  Right.
[02:50:39.582 --> 02:50:44.808]  So 500 feet under the ground, it's 65 degrees, but you start going deeper, it gets hotter and hotter.
[02:50:44.808 --> 02:50:47.251]  All you gotta do is harness the Earth's heat.
[02:50:47.251 --> 02:50:48.012]  Exactly.
[02:50:48.012 --> 02:50:54.499]  And so then you got, you know, you got a nonstop supply of food.
[02:50:54.499 --> 02:50:57.362]  And he says that he doesn't have any type of pest problems.
[02:50:57.362 --> 02:50:59.044]  The only thing that he deals with are aphids.
[02:51:02.390 --> 02:51:06.333]  I haven't seen that video, but how much does he say it costs to tap the Earth's heat?
[02:51:06.333 --> 02:51:09.595]  What'd he do, just drill a geothermal well?
[02:51:09.595 --> 02:51:15.759]  Yeah, so he said it was only 8 feet deep, because at 8 feet, depending on where you're at, it stays anywhere from 58 to...
[02:51:17.432 --> 02:51:17.812]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:51:17.812 --> 02:51:21.253]  Even the EPA recognizes it as the most efficient and greenest energy that there is.
[02:51:21.253 --> 02:51:23.014]  It's kind of shocking that they don't promote it, yeah?
[02:51:47.932 --> 02:51:48.452]  Beautiful.
[02:51:48.452 --> 02:51:49.553]  I'm going to look into that, brother.
[02:51:49.553 --> 02:51:51.054]  Anything else?
[02:51:51.054 --> 02:51:51.374]  Yeah.
[02:51:51.374 --> 02:52:12.169]  And also I wanted to get back to when Trump pulled the funding from the WHO, when we all thought that that was a win for us, he turned right around and donated even more to the tune of $1.8 or maybe $1.18 billion to the GAVI, which is the Global
[02:52:12.851 --> 02:52:13.111]  Yes.
[02:52:13.111 --> 02:52:13.991]  I'm at number 9985.
[02:52:13.991 --> 02:52:15.452]  You're at number one.
[02:52:15.452 --> 02:52:15.872]  Thank you very much.
[02:52:42.307 --> 02:52:45.829]  And that's 150 pounds of love and muscle right there, barking in the background.
[02:52:45.829 --> 02:52:47.150]  Thank you very much.
[02:52:47.150 --> 02:52:49.391]  Well, Mr. Jones, it's an honor to talk to you.
[02:52:49.391 --> 02:52:51.132]  I've been listening since the very beginning.
[02:52:51.132 --> 02:52:57.795]  I heard you on one of your first appearances on Coast to Coast Radio way back when, when Art Bell was still on, I believe, or shortly thereafter.
[02:52:57.795 --> 02:52:58.436]  Yes.
[02:52:58.436 --> 02:53:02.418]  But anyway, I've got three things that I think we've got to do.
[02:53:02.418 --> 02:53:04.619]  I mean, there's no way around it.
[02:53:04.619 --> 02:53:07.080]  We've got to get rid of Washington, D.C.
[02:53:07.080 --> 02:53:09.682]  We don't need a sovereign freaking country in our country.
[02:53:09.682 --> 02:53:10.082]  Go away.
[02:53:11.129 --> 02:53:11.889]  Washington D.C.
[02:53:11.889 --> 02:53:14.771]  is basically, you know, the Vatican.
[02:53:14.771 --> 02:53:16.591]  It's the same sort of deal.
[02:53:16.591 --> 02:53:18.072]  And we need to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[02:53:18.072 --> 02:53:22.554]  We do those two things and, uh, well, we're going in the right direction.
[02:53:22.554 --> 02:53:28.277]  And then the third thing we need to do, we need to start enforcing the, uh, the laws against communism that I believe were passed in, like, 1953.
[02:53:31.518 --> 02:53:32.298]  You're right.
[02:53:32.298 --> 02:53:35.179]  I'm not against Israel, but Israel's been set up like the Vatican.
[02:53:35.179 --> 02:53:44.001]  I'm not against Catholics, but the Vatican, Israel, the city of London within London, that small city within it is above the law, exempt, and so is DC.
[02:53:44.001 --> 02:53:47.842]  And so they set up these city-states to rule over us.
[02:53:47.842 --> 02:53:48.482]  Yeah.
[02:53:48.482 --> 02:53:50.023]  Nothing's going to change until we do that.
[02:53:50.023 --> 02:53:51.723]  I mean, it can't.
[02:53:51.723 --> 02:53:53.364]  It won't.
[02:53:53.364 --> 02:53:55.644]  They don't have to.
[02:53:55.644 --> 02:53:57.825]  They're not answering to us.
[02:53:57.825 --> 02:53:58.605]  And that needs to change.
[02:53:59.284 --> 02:54:00.765]  Well, yeah, absolutely.
[02:54:00.765 --> 02:54:01.966]  And they're talking about making D.C.
[02:54:01.966 --> 02:54:02.387]  a state.
[02:54:02.387 --> 02:54:06.210]  So it's going to be a state with immunity and all this power on top of it.
[02:54:06.210 --> 02:54:07.611]  You just can't do that.
[02:54:07.611 --> 02:54:09.592]  I mean, I think we should abolish the District of Columbia.
[02:54:09.592 --> 02:54:11.454]  It just needs to stop.
[02:54:11.454 --> 02:54:12.274]  I appreciate your call.
[02:54:12.274 --> 02:54:13.355]  Great points.
[02:54:13.355 --> 02:54:14.156]  Bob in Canada.
[02:54:14.156 --> 02:54:14.656]  You're on the air.
[02:54:14.656 --> 02:54:17.258]  Go ahead.
[02:54:17.258 --> 02:54:17.839]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:17.839 --> 02:54:18.940]  25 year listener.
[02:54:18.940 --> 02:54:20.281]  I've been a follower for you.
[02:54:20.281 --> 02:54:22.443]  I love you, brother.
[02:54:22.443 --> 02:54:22.943]  Love your work.
[02:54:23.832 --> 02:54:25.254]  Anyways, we got breaking news.
[02:54:25.254 --> 02:54:30.360]  It's starting to leak out of Twitter, just making waves right now.
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:34.405]  What you need to do, and all your listeners need to do, is listen carefully.
[02:54:35.333 --> 02:54:47.299]  Alright, the egg shortage is direct correlation to basically a protein inhibitor of the chimerically engineered spike protein.
[02:54:47.299 --> 02:54:49.941]  So they're doing this all by design.
[02:54:49.941 --> 02:54:55.244]  Now they're reducing the egg population, the egg production from the chickens.
[02:54:55.244 --> 02:55:01.227]  The chickens, the tractor feed, basically tractor supply, it's tainted feed.
[02:55:01.895 --> 02:55:08.277]  The reason why is that you can even look this up at the NIH website, okay?
[02:55:08.277 --> 02:55:22.281]  The NIH has published a Chinese study by top scientists, alright, in regards to this chicken egg yolk antibodies neutralizing agent SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants.
[02:55:22.281 --> 02:55:30.283]  Basically, what's happening is the IgG's blocking the binding of multiple SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins of the human ACE
[02:55:35.984 --> 02:55:46.486]  Well, there's no doubt that the feed's been attacked, and that now chickens are producing about a third of what they were previously.
[02:55:46.486 --> 02:55:48.546]  And then when people free-range them, they're fine.
[02:55:48.546 --> 02:55:51.507]  And it looks like it's Purina and tractor supply, like you said.
[02:55:51.507 --> 02:55:53.247]  I've been all over it for weeks.
[02:55:53.247 --> 02:55:54.227]  It's not anecdotal.
[02:55:54.227 --> 02:55:55.647]  Scientists are looking at it.
[02:55:55.647 --> 02:55:58.608]  Where do we go on Twitter to find the breaking news about eggs and COVID?
[02:55:59.372 --> 02:56:03.514]  Chuck Colesto just published something on Twitter, all right?
[02:56:03.514 --> 02:56:08.957]  Chuck Colesto, just tell me, what's the Twitter handle?
[02:56:08.957 --> 02:56:11.158]  I don't have it here.
[02:56:11.158 --> 02:56:12.518]  I'll look into it.
[02:56:12.518 --> 02:56:14.199]  I really, really appreciate your call.
[02:56:14.199 --> 02:56:15.300]  Thank you, Bob.
[02:56:15.300 --> 02:56:19.862]  In fact, I was already planning tonight at 6 o'clock to get into the egg situation.
[02:56:19.862 --> 02:56:24.404]  I've covered it weeks ago, but it is absolutely going down.
[02:56:24.404 --> 02:56:27.606]  And again, they're attacking the whole food supply, the energy supply.
[02:56:28.951 --> 02:56:34.973]  They want to collapse it to make us come to them and then beg for the universal basic income that is a social credit score.
[02:56:34.973 --> 02:56:44.716]  So when you look at hundreds of food plants blown up and dozens of eggplants burning down and the chickens suddenly not producing eggs, people have been producing them for decades.
[02:56:44.716 --> 02:56:47.477]  It's a war, folks.
[02:56:47.477 --> 02:56:52.639]  You don't just see Extinction Rebellion out blocking 18-wheelers, you know, outside plants.
[02:56:52.639 --> 02:56:57.541]  You don't just see them blocking cars, going into their jobs.
[02:56:59.469 --> 02:57:01.831]  That's just the millions of these people.
[02:57:01.831 --> 02:57:09.056]  They want to crash civilization so they can be the saviors during the implosion.
[02:57:09.056 --> 02:57:11.998]  Johan and Jefferson, final callers in the next segment.
[02:57:13.424 --> 02:57:17.806]  And then Paul Joseph Watson from England, no longer in London, now in a rural area.
[02:57:17.806 --> 02:57:18.906]  He's bugged out.
[02:57:18.906 --> 02:57:20.387]  He'll take over in the fourth hour.
[02:57:20.387 --> 02:57:23.608]  Then, he's spoiling for a fight with the New World Order.
[02:57:23.608 --> 02:57:25.509]  Owen Schroyer, 3 p.m.
[02:57:25.509 --> 02:57:27.329]  Texas time, 3 p.m.
[02:57:27.329 --> 02:57:29.610]  Central, The War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:57:29.610 --> 02:57:32.691]  And then, 6 p.m.
[02:57:32.691 --> 02:57:33.311]  Infowars.com.
[02:57:35.143 --> 02:57:36.584]  A new show I'm doing.
[02:57:36.584 --> 02:57:38.525]  Commercial-free podcast.
[02:57:38.525 --> 02:57:39.826]  And it's gonna be simulcast here.
[02:57:39.826 --> 02:57:43.107]  So look for that and a new URL tonight.
[02:57:43.107 --> 02:57:48.811]  6pm Central Central Central.
[02:57:48.811 --> 02:57:51.452]  I just want to say about Diet Force.
[02:57:51.452 --> 02:57:53.293]  Diet Force is amazing!
[02:57:53.293 --> 02:57:55.574]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[02:57:55.574 --> 02:57:58.896]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[02:57:58.896 --> 02:58:01.097]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[02:58:03.072 --> 02:58:07.839]  Under my peck, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[02:58:07.839 --> 02:58:10.042]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[02:58:11.218 --> 02:58:14.060]  Like, chip shake for the ladies, mate.

[02:58:16.221 --> 02:58:19.122]  You have to get the Diet Force and have it to a day.
[02:58:19.122 --> 02:58:20.883]  And just keep at it.

[02:58:48.243 --> 02:58:50.444]  There is a war on for your mind.
[02:58:50.444 --> 02:58:52.244]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[02:58:52.244 --> 02:58:54.305]  This is an information war.
[02:58:54.305 --> 02:58:58.986]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[02:58:58.986 --> 02:59:05.468]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[02:59:05.928 --> 02:59:06.689]  We're good to go.
[02:59:27.503 --> 02:59:35.428]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[02:59:35.428 --> 02:59:37.749]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[02:59:37.749 --> 02:59:39.590]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:59:39.590 --> 02:59:40.891]  We're going over the top.
[02:59:40.891 --> 02:59:42.232]  Right now is the critical juncture.

[03:00:06.892 --> 03:00:09.614]  Well, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:09.614 --> 03:00:19.003]  Because there's a war on, for your mind.
[03:00:19.003 --> 03:00:21.505]  Think about America since Andy Griffith.
[03:00:21.505 --> 03:00:22.967]  Where it's gone.
[03:00:22.967 --> 03:00:25.189]  Not good.
[03:00:25.189 --> 03:00:28.411]  Johan, in the great nation of Sweden.
[03:00:28.411 --> 03:00:30.834]  Here on the air, welcome.
[03:00:30.834 --> 03:00:32.315]  Hey man.
[03:00:32.315 --> 03:00:33.296]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:00:34.900 --> 03:00:39.363]  Yeah, I've been a long-time listener for I think it's eight years.
[03:00:39.363 --> 03:00:43.447]  I'm also a customer, satisfied customer and donor.
[03:00:43.447 --> 03:00:44.387]  Thank you.
[03:00:44.387 --> 03:00:46.109]  Yeah, I'll get straight into it.
[03:00:46.109 --> 03:00:58.159]  I have a question regarding like the vaccines and the plummeting birth rates and things you reported on in Sweden and in Germany and everything.
[03:00:59.031 --> 03:01:04.573]  Sure, the birth rates were already plummeting, but they went off a cliff two and a half years ago with the shots.
[03:01:04.573 --> 03:01:09.815]  Just like chickens, that's their birth rate, that's your eggs, we're not having children either.
[03:01:09.815 --> 03:01:10.815]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:01:10.815 --> 03:01:26.640]  And I mean, looking at that, I mean, I'm obviously un-vexed, and I mean, a single guy on the dating market, and I'm just like, not sure how to process this information, like, considering like, dating people and stuff, because if you look at the statistics,
[03:01:27.344 --> 03:01:37.248]  Like people in my age like 25 to 35 is supposed to be like at least 70 to 80 percent people took at least one shot.
[03:01:37.248 --> 03:01:41.409]  So it's a question what should you do when you're trying to find a wife or a girlfriend?
[03:01:41.409 --> 03:01:42.070]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:01:42.070 --> 03:01:48.152]  I don't know how to navigate this information because I don't know how many people like have gotten a placebo or whatever.
[03:01:48.152 --> 03:01:48.632]  What's
[03:01:49.192 --> 03:01:55.235]  I don't know either, but it would be good if you found women, just as a test to see how smart they are, that didn't take the shot.
[03:01:55.235 --> 03:02:01.157]  That's a big plus right there, kind of in the Darwinistic view.
[03:02:01.157 --> 03:02:08.641]  But at the same time, ivermectin, if you catch it from them, because it looks like it does spread, we know it does, it does slough, especially right after they take it.
[03:02:08.641 --> 03:02:12.422]  If you love the woman and she meant well, she could probably be healed.
[03:02:12.422 --> 03:02:15.724]  A lot of vitamin D, a lot of vitamin C. Here's an article that just went up on InfoWars.
[03:02:16.820 --> 03:02:18.121]  Yeah, that sounds like great advice.
[03:02:18.121 --> 03:02:20.582]  I mean, that's basically how I have been navigating it.
[03:02:43.740 --> 03:02:48.061]  Some part of it is also like being guided somewhat by fear, you know?
[03:02:48.061 --> 03:02:49.982]  Like, what if I make the wrong choice?
[03:02:49.982 --> 03:02:51.302]  What if this doesn't work out?
[03:02:51.302 --> 03:02:56.364]  What if, like, I'm... Well, here's the good news and the bad news.
[03:02:56.364 --> 03:02:59.345]  This stuff's infecting everybody whether you took a shot or not.
[03:02:59.345 --> 03:03:00.565]  And the virus causes it.
[03:03:00.565 --> 03:03:01.906]  It's not as bad as a shot.
[03:03:01.906 --> 03:03:05.227]  So we just gotta figure out ways to purify and clean ourselves out.
[03:03:05.227 --> 03:03:06.467]  And then I would just go with your gut.
[03:03:06.467 --> 03:03:08.988]  I'd go with your spirit, man.
[03:03:08.988 --> 03:03:09.848]  Right, right.
[03:03:09.848 --> 03:03:10.909]  Thanks.
[03:03:10.909 --> 03:03:11.649]  Anything else, brother?
[03:03:12.887 --> 03:03:14.008]  No, that's all.
[03:03:14.008 --> 03:03:14.748]  Thank you.
[03:03:14.748 --> 03:03:16.229]  Thanks for listening for eight years, Johan.
[03:03:16.229 --> 03:03:16.990]  Amazing.
[03:03:16.990 --> 03:03:18.571]  All right, Jefferson, you're our tail gunner.
[03:03:18.571 --> 03:03:21.253]  Go ahead from Virginia.
[03:03:21.253 --> 03:03:23.134]  Alex, what a great bunch of callers today.
[03:03:23.134 --> 03:03:23.974]  Fantastic.
[03:03:23.974 --> 03:03:27.337]  Wow.
[03:03:27.337 --> 03:03:36.723]  Mike Adams is saying if you take N-acetylcysteine, NAC, and bromelain, which is a simple supplement from pineapples stems,
[03:03:37.378 --> 03:03:41.100]  That unfolds the proteins, the spike proteins that your body needs.
[03:03:41.100 --> 03:03:42.580]  Yes, so does nitric oxide in the blood.
[03:03:42.580 --> 03:03:44.821]  That's what the doctors are telling me, yes.
[03:03:44.821 --> 03:03:50.003]  So that can help people get over being injected with this mRNA poison, essentially.
[03:03:50.003 --> 03:03:55.345]  If they would just take bromelain and NAC, that's their best chance of defeating the system.
[03:03:55.345 --> 03:03:59.027]  We were going to talk about mind control.
[03:03:59.027 --> 03:04:02.488]  Your mom seems to think that Biden's going to be assassinated.
[03:04:02.488 --> 03:04:06.410]  I don't know why they would do that when they don't really want Kamala Harris to be the president.
[03:04:07.094 --> 03:04:14.176]  And Kevin McCarthy would be willing to elevate to the presidency if they got rid of Kamala.
[03:04:14.176 --> 03:04:16.977]  So it doesn't make a lot of sense to get rid of Biden.
[03:04:16.977 --> 03:04:20.617]  Well, maybe they blow them both up on an airplane.
[03:04:20.617 --> 03:04:23.018]  Yes, but then you end up with Kevin McCarthy as the president.
[03:04:23.018 --> 03:04:25.239]  That's a terrible idea for the liberals or the leftists.
[03:04:25.239 --> 03:04:26.059]  They would lose control.
[03:04:26.059 --> 03:04:26.319]  I hear you.
[03:04:26.319 --> 03:04:27.739]  That's why my mom never gets political.
[03:04:27.739 --> 03:04:28.820]  She thinks they're going to kill Biden.
[03:04:28.820 --> 03:04:30.220]  That's what she's picking up.
[03:04:31.715 --> 03:04:36.438]  I agree that Biden might die tomorrow one way or another, but that would be a bad thing.
[03:04:58.649 --> 03:05:04.895]  In early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[03:05:04.895 --> 03:05:13.282]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[03:05:13.282 --> 03:05:15.505]  So I thank you for your passionate support.
[03:05:15.505 --> 03:05:19.008]  Now that was a three-coin series, the founding member coin.
[03:05:19.008 --> 03:05:22.371]  The final coin that we're putting out for a long time
[03:05:23.075 --> 03:05:29.821]  Is the Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin exclusively available at 1776coin.com?
[03:05:29.821 --> 03:05:35.565]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left.
[03:05:35.565 --> 03:05:38.808]  And yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[03:05:38.868 --> 03:05:39.749]  We're good to go.
[03:06:17.635 --> 03:06:21.818]  Live it is, the Summit News Hour.
[03:06:21.818 --> 03:06:31.544]  Later in the hour, I'm going to talk about ChatGPT, this new artificial intelligence chatbot.
[03:06:39.218 --> 03:06:42.620]  Which is now apparently writing Hollywood blockbusters.
[03:06:42.620 --> 03:06:46.822]  It's performing the functions that doctors, lawyers could perform.
[03:06:46.822 --> 03:06:48.002]  It's writing poems.
[03:06:48.002 --> 03:06:49.963]  It's writing song lyrics.
[03:06:49.963 --> 03:06:53.645]  And of course, it's responding to political questions.
[03:06:53.645 --> 03:06:58.247]  Spicy questions about race, about Donald Trump, Joe Biden.
[03:06:58.247 --> 03:07:01.809]  And a certain inherent bias has come to the fore.
[03:07:01.809 --> 03:07:03.570]  I wonder if you can guess what that is.
[03:07:03.570 --> 03:07:05.711]  We're going to get into that later.
[03:07:05.711 --> 03:07:07.072]  But every single day that goes by,
[03:07:07.751 --> 03:07:16.258]  The anti-lockdown activists, the anti-vaccine mandate sceptics, are proven right in triplicate time and time again.
[03:07:16.258 --> 03:07:26.286]  The very same people that were demonised beyond belief, monstered, vilified by the mainstream media, by the establishment, now proven correct once again.
[03:07:26.286 --> 03:07:28.668]  This is out of zero hedge.
[03:07:29.773 --> 03:07:35.476]  Massive peer-reviewed mask study shows little to no difference in preventing Covid flu infection.
[03:07:35.476 --> 03:07:37.758]  The gold standard apparently.
[03:07:37.758 --> 03:07:40.819]  This Cochrane database of systematic reviews.
[03:07:40.819 --> 03:07:43.921]  This is the peer-reviewed study into mask mandates.
[03:07:43.921 --> 03:07:46.562]  Published and peer-reviewed.
[03:07:46.562 --> 03:07:51.005]  It's the strongest science to date refuting the basis for mask mandates worldwide they say.
[03:07:51.005 --> 03:07:52.406]  Trust the science.
[03:07:52.406 --> 03:07:56.148]  Here's the peer-reviewed science proven right once again.
[03:07:57.216 --> 03:07:59.458]  Massive international research collaboration.
[03:07:59.458 --> 03:08:02.442]  This is basically the study of studies.
[03:08:02.442 --> 03:08:05.064]  This is the Grand Poobah.
[03:08:05.064 --> 03:08:08.308]  Analyzed several dozen rigorous studies.
[03:08:08.308 --> 03:08:14.974]  So it's a study of a dozen studies already proven, focusing on physical interventions against COVID-19.
[03:08:16.497 --> 03:08:20.360]  And they provide little to no protection against infection or illness rates.
[03:08:20.360 --> 03:08:27.685]  And again, for the past, what is it, nearly three years now, we pointed to every single study showed little to no difference.
[03:08:27.685 --> 03:08:36.052]  Some of them even suggested that wearing the mask made the spread of the virus worse because people are constantly touching their masks.
[03:08:36.052 --> 03:08:39.194]  The only people you see, at least in the UK now, still wearing masks
[03:08:40.183 --> 03:08:55.413]  Basically, big fat people waddling down the street who have comorbidities who you think would have several health complications and health concerns that weren't related to Covid, but they're somehow the ones most likely to wear the masks.
[03:08:55.413 --> 03:09:07.081]  In America meanwhile, this totem of oath, basically it's a loyalty oath to the regime, to the narrative that masks work when they clearly don't, even by their own peer-reviewed science they don't,
[03:09:07.882 --> 03:09:11.129]  Still persists to this day!
[03:09:11.129 --> 03:09:12.732]  Video!
[03:09:12.732 --> 03:09:18.364]  Colbert brags about his NPC audience still wearing masks, and in fact we have the clip right now.
[03:09:18.364 --> 03:09:19.046]  Let's roll it!
[03:09:20.783 --> 03:09:28.667]  Tonight, breathing easy, because the White House has finally announced they plan to end the COVID public health emergency in May.
[03:09:28.667 --> 03:09:29.988]  Take that, COVID!
[03:09:29.988 --> 03:09:31.208]  We beat you!
[03:09:31.208 --> 03:09:35.130]  Shove that up your nose and rotate it five times.
[03:09:35.130 --> 03:09:37.191]  This has been a long time coming.
[03:09:37.191 --> 03:09:40.172]  I wish you could see the smiles on the faces of my audience.
[03:09:40.172 --> 03:09:46.095]  And I wish I could, too, because they're still wearing masks.
[03:09:46.095 --> 03:09:47.116]  The end is near!
[03:09:48.749 --> 03:09:49.970]  The end is near.
[03:09:49.970 --> 03:09:51.511]  This is a huge moment.
[03:09:51.511 --> 03:09:55.613]  After all the COVID, we've all been through the Delta variant.
[03:09:55.613 --> 03:09:56.433]  Omicron.
[03:09:56.433 --> 03:09:57.974]  Omicron VA2.
[03:09:57.974 --> 03:10:01.956]  XBB.1.5.
[03:10:01.956 --> 03:10:05.218]  Z95, the homoclassic.
[03:10:05.218 --> 03:10:05.798]  There you have it.
[03:10:05.798 --> 03:10:11.161]  Even after, you know, Fauci, their idol, their savior, disappeared from the scene, basically.
[03:10:11.161 --> 03:10:14.523]  Even after Biden says it, in fact, he said it was over months ago, didn't he?
[03:10:14.523 --> 03:10:16.524]  Now they're officially codifying it.
[03:10:17.250 --> 03:10:21.211]  Still not letting people like me into America though, because I'm unvaccinated.
[03:10:21.211 --> 03:10:22.592]  I can get into Afghanistan.
[03:10:22.592 --> 03:10:25.772]  I can get into all these third world crap old countries.
[03:10:25.772 --> 03:10:27.593]  Not America!
[03:10:27.593 --> 03:10:35.555]  And yet still, almost three years after the outbreak of this, every single one of them in the audience is wearing a mask.
[03:10:35.555 --> 03:10:38.376]  This is a loyalty oath to the regime.
[03:10:38.376 --> 03:10:39.936]  It always has been.
[03:10:39.936 --> 03:10:45.318]  The mandates were only ever in place so they could patrol the other inmates in the prison.
[03:10:46.374 --> 03:10:56.902]  And of course it came out in British newspapers, based on the research of Laura Doddsworth and others, that they deliberately imposed the mask mandates despite knowing they didn't work.
[03:10:56.902 --> 03:11:12.473]  Remember at the start of the pandemic, it was in the Fauci emails, it was everywhere, they knew the masks did nothing to stop the virus and in fact the very early Covid advice was to discourage the use of masks because they said it would make it worse.
[03:11:12.473 --> 03:11:14.354]  That was in the early Fauci emails.
[03:11:15.242 --> 03:11:26.301]  But as soon as they knew that they could use it as this tool of population control to merely remind people that they're in a pandemic and to enforce compliance with behavior in other aspects...
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:30.261]  Such as lockdown and of course such as taking the vaccine.
[03:11:30.261 --> 03:11:32.422]  That's why they impose the mask mandates.
[03:11:32.422 --> 03:11:35.023]  Purely as a tool of population control.
[03:11:35.023 --> 03:11:37.884]  Had nothing to do with preventing the spread of the virus.
[03:11:37.884 --> 03:11:43.946]  The British government's own studies into masks in schools proved that it had no effect whatsoever.
[03:11:43.946 --> 03:11:44.566]  What did they do?
[03:11:44.566 --> 03:11:46.787]  They mandated masks in schools.
[03:11:46.787 --> 03:11:48.127]  Follow the science.
[03:11:48.127 --> 03:11:49.148]  They didn't.
[03:11:49.148 --> 03:11:52.209]  But you still have these NPCs performing their loyalty oaths.
[03:11:53.365 --> 03:11:59.810]  God forbid they would have to give up on what was supposedly this horrible thing that happened to us three years ago.
[03:11:59.810 --> 03:12:09.678]  They desperately want to grip onto it because it forms the basis of their entire character, their entire identity of busybody control freaks.
[03:12:09.678 --> 03:12:16.343]  Meanwhile in Australia, Australian health authorities call for more COVID boosters, but the public says no.
[03:12:17.478 --> 03:12:28.408]  You saw the Pfizer documents where they said we want Covid boosters every single year for everyone, while people in Australia really aren't into it that much anymore.
[03:12:28.408 --> 03:12:28.949]  Says here.
[03:12:29.705 --> 03:12:35.990]  Australian health authorities are once again calling for the public to take a fourth Covid booster shot, but with very little response.
[03:12:35.990 --> 03:12:43.336]  So 40% of Australians took the third booster, and now only 30% are taking the fourth booster.
[03:12:43.336 --> 03:12:57.428]  So now you're even seeing those numbers decline amongst the Covidians themselves, amongst the branch Covidians, the true believers, where now a minority of them in major countries are taking this booster vaccine.
[03:12:58.422 --> 03:13:00.884]  So the narrative has well and truly collapsed.
[03:13:00.884 --> 03:13:16.734]  This is largely over now but of course we wait for the promised next pandemic which the WHO, which Bill Gates with his five bellies hanging out, the big health expert, has promised us for months and months.
[03:13:16.734 --> 03:13:27.081]  Another aspect of population control is of course the cost of living crisis here in the UK and making everyone energy dependent or energy independent
[03:13:28.007 --> 03:13:30.048]  This is out of Breitbart, Great Reset.
[03:13:30.048 --> 03:13:35.132]  Britain's faced £300 fine for burning wood to keep warm.
[03:13:35.132 --> 03:13:38.394]  They get everyone dependent on the gas electricity.
[03:13:38.394 --> 03:13:49.281]  They ratchet up the price of that through support for the current thing, the war in Ukraine, and of course these disastrous net zero green levies, which basically is a tax on the poor.
[03:13:49.281 --> 03:13:51.262]  The upper middle class, the rich, can afford them.
[03:13:52.259 --> 03:14:02.825]  They can afford the levies that go towards building this disastrous green economy that won't work, that causes misery, darkness, coldness, mass unemployment.
[03:14:02.825 --> 03:14:03.786]  They can afford all that.
[03:14:03.786 --> 03:14:15.973]  The people who can't afford it are people at the bottom rung of the social ladder, the poor who are seeing their energy bills rise beyond £300, £400 a month.
[03:14:15.973 --> 03:14:18.074]  So we have the government now in its infinite wisdom,
[03:14:19.065 --> 03:14:32.528]  Telling local authorities to crack down on people using wood-burning stoves to keep warm with fines of £300 or potentially criminal prosecutions for those who continually refuse to abide by state climate diktats.
[03:14:32.528 --> 03:14:47.891]  So remember back in 2022 you had Germans mass panic buying stoves because they saw the skyrocketing energy prices coming, led to a run on gas stoves, they actually ran out, they started running out of firewood as well.
[03:14:49.016 --> 03:14:56.699]  Here in the UK, they're simply saying, no, you're not going to be allowed to burn wood to keep yourself warm because climate change.
[03:14:56.699 --> 03:14:59.460]  It's always been about population control.
[03:14:59.460 --> 03:15:02.280]  It's always been about reduction of living standards.
[03:15:02.280 --> 03:15:03.641]  And again, this proves it.
[03:15:03.641 --> 03:15:07.482]  The 15-minute cities, all of it.
[03:15:07.482 --> 03:15:15.645]  Amid the energy crisis in Britain, which came to fruition in large part as a result of the Conservative government obsessing with implementing globalist Green Agenda policies,
[03:15:16.676 --> 03:15:23.621]  While refusing to tap the nation's more reliable natural resources, such as natural gas, the use of wood-burning stoves has soared.
[03:15:23.621 --> 03:15:27.364]  Well, now they're going to fine people £175 to £300.
[03:15:27.364 --> 03:15:29.145]  How are they even going to enforce this?
[03:15:29.145 --> 03:15:42.735]  You're going to have council tattletale workers walking past people's houses, watching the smoke rise out of chimneys, knocking on the door, and saying, excuse me, oi mate, have you got a license for that wood?
[03:15:43.439 --> 03:15:44.901]  Is that how it's going to be enforced?
[03:15:44.901 --> 03:15:49.366]  Or are neighbours going to tattle on neighbours as they did during Covid lockdowns?
[03:15:49.366 --> 03:15:51.829]  That's how they hope to enforce it.
[03:15:51.829 --> 03:15:53.091]  This is The Great Reset.
[03:15:53.091 --> 03:15:53.692]  We'll be back.
[03:15:53.692 --> 03:15:54.493]  Summit.News.
[03:15:57.088 --> 03:15:58.909]  InfoWars is winning.
[03:15:58.909 --> 03:16:00.949]  InfoWars is reaching more people than ever.
[03:16:00.949 --> 03:16:03.730]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[03:16:03.730 --> 03:16:06.491]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[03:16:06.491 --> 03:16:08.592]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[03:16:08.592 --> 03:16:10.653]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[03:16:10.653 --> 03:16:11.613]  None of that's true.
[03:16:11.613 --> 03:16:12.994]  It's all being appealed.
[03:16:12.994 --> 03:16:15.115]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead.
[03:16:15.115 --> 03:16:21.517]  But if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals, and we will not be taken off the air.
[03:16:21.957 --> 03:16:25.402]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[03:16:25.402 --> 03:16:28.105]  Don't let the globalists psyop you and your family.
[03:16:28.105 --> 03:16:38.019]  Go to Infowarshore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, that fund the Infowar and empower your life and let the globalists know their psyop has not worked.
[03:16:38.459 --> 03:16:39.821]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[03:16:39.821 --> 03:16:48.331]  Take action at InfoWarsTore.com today, because the only people who can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners.
[03:16:48.331 --> 03:16:51.715]  The majority of you have not been signed off, but some of you have.
[03:16:51.715 --> 03:16:53.477]  Do not let the gloveless brain wash you.
[03:16:53.477 --> 03:16:55.400]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com to keep us on the air.
[03:16:57.105 --> 03:17:01.628]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars MD.
[03:17:01.628 --> 03:17:14.075]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[03:17:14.075 --> 03:17:15.275]  These are high-end.
[03:17:15.275 --> 03:17:16.336]  These are the very best.
[03:17:16.656 --> 03:17:19.138]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[03:17:19.138 --> 03:17:19.659]  Well, guess what?
[03:17:19.659 --> 03:17:25.445]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[03:17:25.445 --> 03:17:28.067]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[03:17:28.067 --> 03:17:34.954]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality full-spectrum CBD.
[03:17:34.954 --> 03:17:40.159]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:17:40.159 --> 03:17:41.140]  The highest quality.
[03:17:41.420 --> 03:17:50.216]  Directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50% in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[03:17:50.216 --> 03:17:52.199]  M4 Wars MD and M4WarsStore.com
[03:17:57.045 --> 03:18:07.054]  The good news is the Real Red Pill Plus, after over two years being sold out because the key ingredients were unavailable with supply chain breakdowns, is finally back in stock in the last month.
[03:18:07.054 --> 03:18:10.777]  The bad news is we need a limited run of it and it's almost sold out.
[03:18:10.777 --> 03:18:13.139]  So, we're in late January when I'm cutting this.
[03:18:13.139 --> 03:18:18.224]  Only seven days left to get the Real Red Pill Plus with all the key ingredients like preglanone and more.
[03:18:19.004 --> 03:18:20.025]  We're good to go.
[03:18:44.065 --> 03:18:47.672]  You need to try the Real Red Pill Plus right now, plus it funds the InfoWar.
[03:18:47.672 --> 03:18:49.596]  The only way we fail is if we don't take action.
[03:18:49.596 --> 03:18:54.946]  Real Red Pill Plus, now available at 50% off at InfoWarStore.com for only a few more days.
[03:18:56.789 --> 03:19:01.551]  The Second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[03:19:01.551 --> 03:19:06.752]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[03:19:06.752 --> 03:19:11.594]  And Infowars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[03:19:11.594 --> 03:19:16.556]  Now, in the last year, we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[03:19:16.556 --> 03:19:25.579]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission and you get a historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[03:19:26.059 --> 03:19:39.064]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt, Man of the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now while supplies last at 1776coin.com.
[03:19:39.064 --> 03:19:42.986]  And just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt or a DVD,
[03:19:43.706 --> 03:19:47.547]  That's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[03:19:47.547 --> 03:19:51.968]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at $17.76 on what coins remain.
[03:19:51.968 --> 03:19:53.848]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[03:20:16.371 --> 03:20:24.515]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:24.515 --> 03:20:31.678]  So they're basically starting to ban wood burning to heat homes in the United Kingdom.
[03:20:31.678 --> 03:20:39.822]  They're going to be starting off with the fines and they're talking about criminal prosecutions for burning wood to heat your own home.
[03:20:39.822 --> 03:20:45.645]  This is the level of micromanagement, totalitarian control freakism that we're facing right now.
[03:20:46.704 --> 03:20:59.128]  In this article, it points out that local councils in England, local government that is, have issued just 17 fines against people for burning wood, even though they received over 18,000 complaints from fellow citizens.
[03:20:59.128 --> 03:21:00.528]  Oh my God!
[03:21:00.528 --> 03:21:01.708]  He's burning wood!
[03:21:01.708 --> 03:21:04.369]  Report him to the authorities!
[03:21:04.369 --> 03:21:06.730]  And yet, there's no enforcement mechanism.
[03:21:06.730 --> 03:21:09.251]  Apparently, now there will be.
[03:21:09.251 --> 03:21:14.072]  We also learn from this article, the move was hailed by client Earth,
[03:21:15.234 --> 03:21:21.935]  A green charity campaign group called for the government to go further and ban burning wood domestically outright.
[03:21:21.935 --> 03:21:27.016]  Yes, criminalise the burning of all wood across the entire country.
[03:21:27.016 --> 03:21:40.919]  Once again, this Conservative in name only government following the dictates of deranged, hysterical, far-left environmental groups and making it a fulcrum, an integral part of government policy.
[03:21:40.919 --> 03:21:42.019]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:21:42.725 --> 03:21:53.568]  He points out that the office of far-left London Mayor Sadiq Khan praised the move, with a spokesman saying, by taking a lead in the capital, the mayor has already reduced air pollution in London five times faster than the rest of the country since 2016.
[03:21:53.568 --> 03:22:06.652]  And of course, this is the low-emission zone across London, which is in central London at the moment, but they're trying to expand it out to the suburbs to cover basically 20 million people.
[03:22:07.330 --> 03:22:21.716]  Where if you're driving a petrol car that was made, produced before 2005, and a diesel car produced before 2015, so you could have a diesel car that's as recent as 2014, you have to pay a tax.
[03:22:22.689 --> 03:22:30.575]  Of, I forgot how much it is, but I think it's about the equivalent of $15, $20 a day, every day that you drive through London.
[03:22:30.575 --> 03:22:31.836]  And again, they're expanding it.
[03:22:31.836 --> 03:22:33.757]  This is not just central London.
[03:22:33.757 --> 03:22:35.378]  This is the outer suburbs.
[03:22:35.378 --> 03:22:47.547]  This is residential areas, enforced by cameras, enforced by these environmental officers, where you have to pay a daily tax simply to drive your car from home to work.
[03:22:47.547 --> 03:22:50.409]  And again, that's a tax on the poor.
[03:22:50.409 --> 03:22:51.970]  Who typically owns cars?
[03:22:52.717 --> 03:23:03.185]  Produced in the early 2000s, or in the case of diesel cars, before the year 2015, it's poorer people who can't continually afford to keep buying new cars.
[03:23:03.185 --> 03:23:14.173]  Another tax on the poor, in the name of net zero, in the name of climate change, and yet they sell it as this big, you know, progressive, utopian, liberal thing.
[03:23:14.173 --> 03:23:18.035]  You're literally taxing the poor into poverty and killing them.
[03:23:18.035 --> 03:23:20.577]  How liberal is that?
[03:23:20.577 --> 03:23:21.398]  Speaking of London,
[03:23:22.569 --> 03:23:29.055]  London police recruiting illiterate officers who can barely write English to meet diversity quotas.
[03:23:29.055 --> 03:23:40.425]  This is the true Clockwork Orange dystopia where they literally are having to hire criminals and people who can't even speak the language to police the other criminals.
[03:23:40.425 --> 03:23:41.586]  This is all based on a 2014 promise.
[03:23:43.280 --> 03:23:50.764]  To have 40% of the police force in London represented by ethnic minorities by 2023, by now.
[03:23:50.764 --> 03:23:52.024]  They've failed to achieve that.
[03:23:52.024 --> 03:23:54.545]  They've only got up to 17%.
[03:23:54.545 --> 03:23:59.648]  Because a lot of these people from ethnic minority backgrounds don't want to be police.
[03:23:59.648 --> 03:24:08.752]  And the reason they did it is explained clearly by Matt Parr, the head of the organisation responsible for inspecting British police forces.
[03:24:08.752 --> 03:24:10.133]  He told the Telegraph London
[03:24:10.836 --> 03:24:19.382]  We'll likely be a minority white city in the next decade or so, so it should not be policed by an overwhelmingly white police force, and what's the solution to that?
[03:24:19.972 --> 03:24:26.076]  They lowered the standards to hire people who are so illiterate they can't even write police reports in English.
[03:24:26.076 --> 03:24:29.719]  And in some cases, they're literally criminals.
[03:24:29.719 --> 03:24:40.466]  Let's go to this next video now, though, because on the subject of diversity, Channel 4 interviewed a Ukrainian refugee about diversity in the United Kingdom, and suffice to say, she wasn't a fan.
[03:24:40.466 --> 03:24:44.548]  This is called Based Ukrainian Refugee Causes Offence.
[03:24:44.548 --> 03:24:45.129]  Let's roll it.
[03:24:45.669 --> 03:24:49.552]  We all need a good laugh sometimes and I certainly got one out of this.
[03:24:49.552 --> 03:24:58.219]  Left-wing news broadcaster Channel 4 spoke to Ukrainian refugees and Brits that hosted them while living in the diverse city of Birmingham.
[03:24:58.219 --> 03:25:02.722]  England's second biggest city where white people make up less than 50% of the population.
[03:25:02.722 --> 03:25:05.204]  And let's just say it didn't quite go according to plan.
[03:25:05.204 --> 03:25:12.549]  So again, this is a liberal white woman talking about what a Ukrainian refugee that she housed said about the local area.
[03:25:12.549 --> 03:25:12.769]  I think...
[03:25:13.770 --> 03:25:20.773]  Um, we hadn't necessarily taken into consideration the cultural differences.
[03:25:20.773 --> 03:25:27.937]  But those cultural differences weren't often talked about when Andrea signed up to the Homes for Ukraine scheme.
[03:25:27.937 --> 03:25:30.758]  She lives in a diverse part of Birmingham.
[03:25:30.758 --> 03:25:36.081]  After a week of staying there, her guest told her there were too many Muslims in the area.
[03:25:36.081 --> 03:25:37.501]  I mean, she said it, not me!
[03:25:37.501 --> 03:25:42.584]  We were quite shocked at how difficult she found different cultures.
[03:25:42.964 --> 03:25:44.324]  She felt there were just too many Muslims.
[03:25:44.324 --> 03:25:46.025]  Too many Muslims.
[03:25:46.025 --> 03:25:47.805]  Too many people with different skin colours.
[03:25:47.805 --> 03:25:48.526]  How racist!
[03:25:48.526 --> 03:25:54.187]  She arrived in a Western European Christian country and expected the people there to be white?
[03:25:54.187 --> 03:25:54.948]  How naive!
[03:25:54.948 --> 03:26:00.909]  Her guest's son was enrolled into the local school, where the majority of children happen to be black and Asian.
[03:26:00.909 --> 03:26:02.330]  Oh yeah, it just happened to be that way.
[03:26:02.330 --> 03:26:09.392]  And then to just have her complain about the demographic of the school and going, well, he can't be safe there, there's...
[03:26:11.696 --> 03:26:13.977]  Not enough white kids, essentially.
[03:26:13.977 --> 03:26:15.978]  They both agreed to end the placement.
[03:26:15.978 --> 03:26:21.420]  Presumably returning to her war-torn homeland was more of a pull than staying in Birmingham.
[03:26:21.420 --> 03:26:26.523]  And that can be quite like, wow, you know, I thought England was full of English people.
[03:26:26.523 --> 03:26:29.104]  White English people in England's second city?
[03:26:29.104 --> 03:26:31.105]  What kind of moron could expect to see that?
[03:26:31.105 --> 03:26:35.847]  They then spoke directly to one of the Ukrainian refugees and that's where it got even funnier.
[03:26:35.967 --> 03:26:41.011]  So on the one hand, a city under constant bombardment by a nuclear-armed superpower, versus...
[03:26:47.825 --> 03:26:49.226]  Staying in Birmingham.
[03:26:49.226 --> 03:26:49.846]  Tough one.
[03:26:49.846 --> 03:26:52.407]  Oksana moved here from Kiev last summer.
[03:26:52.407 --> 03:26:57.530]  Living side by side with so many different cultures made her feel afraid.
[03:26:57.530 --> 03:26:58.130]  Afraid?
[03:26:58.130 --> 03:27:00.091]  What could she possibly be afraid of?
[03:27:00.091 --> 03:27:03.593]  I was very afraid because it was not usually for me.
[03:27:03.593 --> 03:27:11.317]  And some people just told me about so many dangerous stories.
[03:27:11.317 --> 03:27:17.300]  Lots of people here would feel very offended that you feel just because it's a mixed area it's not safe.
[03:27:17.580 --> 03:27:19.282]  Oh no, people are offended!
[03:27:19.282 --> 03:27:21.004]  Check out her brutal comeback.
[03:27:21.004 --> 03:27:24.187]  Oksana's not racist, she's just read police crime statistics.
[03:27:38.883 --> 03:27:42.087]  She's just done her research!
[03:27:42.087 --> 03:27:45.069]  Good decision.
[03:27:45.069 --> 03:27:52.477]  This is not the first time that Ukrainian refugees have had some not-so-complimentary things to say about cultural enrichment.
[03:27:52.477 --> 03:27:59.384]  At the start of the conflict, we highlighted how some were refusing to go to multicultural Sweden over fears for their safety.
[03:27:59.744 --> 03:28:10.007]  When it came down to a choice between facing potential Russian airstrikes and facing Sweden's notorious high-crime migrant ghettos, they chose the airstrikes.
[03:28:10.007 --> 03:28:10.487]  There you have it.
[03:28:10.487 --> 03:28:18.309]  I'm not going to get a chance to go to this other video on immigration to the UK, because I'm going to talk about chat GPT in the next segment.
[03:28:18.309 --> 03:28:25.571]  Suffice to say, though, we now learn after being given free hotel accommodation, free healthcare, free dental care, free education for their kids,
[03:28:26.713 --> 03:28:38.900]  Illegally immigrants who jump on boats from France are now being given free prepaid debit cards which are loaded up by the government, all taxpayer-funded of course, which they can then spend.
[03:28:38.900 --> 03:28:41.621]  So there's no disincentivisation whatsoever.
[03:28:41.621 --> 03:28:45.363]  They literally get everything handed to a plate on them.
[03:28:45.363 --> 03:28:51.427]  They don't get deported, nothing happens to them, and we wonder why they keep coming across in record numbers every single year.
[03:28:51.427 --> 03:28:53.208]  Summit.News will be back.
[03:28:53.208 --> 03:28:53.728]  Oh, go away.
[03:28:57.762 --> 03:29:04.964]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars live products have always been the highest quality, triple tested, and you've seen the right reviews.

[03:29:57.444 --> 03:30:09.931]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[03:30:12.753 --> 03:30:22.995]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[03:30:22.995 --> 03:30:34.818]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[03:30:34.818 --> 03:30:36.358]  This is why they attack us.
[03:30:36.838 --> 03:30:39.361]  This is why we need your support.
[03:30:39.361 --> 03:30:41.163]  Because we tell the truth.
[03:30:41.163 --> 03:30:43.366]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:30:43.366 --> 03:30:44.807]  Join the resistance.

[03:30:51.695 --> 03:30:53.898]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[03:30:57.352 --> 03:31:07.339]  The good news is, the real Red Pill Plus, after over two years being sold out because the key ingredients were unavailable with supply chain breakdowns, is finally back in stock in the last month.
[03:31:07.339 --> 03:31:11.062]  The bad news is, we need a limited run of it, and it's almost sold out.
[03:31:11.062 --> 03:31:13.424]  So, we're in late January when I'm cutting this.

[03:31:27.988 --> 03:31:29.329]  It's proprietary.
[03:31:29.329 --> 03:31:29.969]  It's amazing.
[03:31:29.969 --> 03:31:35.050]  I learned about it from a research scientist and a medical doctor who had a similar formula five years ago.
[03:31:35.050 --> 03:31:38.431]  We simply made it stronger and we have great reviews from listeners.
[03:31:38.431 --> 03:31:40.812]  Get the Real Red Pill Plus for a limited time.
[03:31:40.812 --> 03:31:41.492]  It's about to end.
[03:31:41.832 --> 03:31:42.133]  I think so.
[03:31:57.110 --> 03:31:59.692]  The cavalry has arrived.
[03:31:59.692 --> 03:32:13.099]  Ultimate bone broth is the strongest, highest quality chicken-based bone broth you're going to find with all of the effects for your joints, your bones, your muscles, your heart, but more importantly, your immune system.
[03:32:13.099 --> 03:32:15.361]  Everybody knows about grandma and chicken broth.
[03:32:15.361 --> 03:32:20.444]  Well, this is concentrated chicken broth, the strongest out there with chaga mushroom and
[03:32:21.044 --> 03:32:24.488]  A whole bunch of other ingredients, like turmeric, the list goes on and on.

[03:32:58.796 --> 03:33:04.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:28.970 --> 03:33:37.674]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:40.134 --> 03:33:47.019]  Well, we've been warning about the growth of artificial intelligence, how it's going to be weaponized against humanity.
[03:33:47.019 --> 03:33:50.461]  Alex Jones has been talking about that for decades now.
[03:33:50.461 --> 03:34:01.668]  Now we have the emergence of chat, GPT, you've probably heard about it in the news in this video, I'll describe what it is, and how the artificial intelligence has now gone woke.
[03:34:01.668 --> 03:34:09.794]  This is about a seven minute video, so it's going to last most of this segment, but it's a crucial, important issue that everyone really needs to get a grip of.
[03:34:10.532 --> 03:34:14.818]  This video is called, We Have a Problem.
[03:34:14.818 --> 03:34:17.242]  Houston, we have a problem.
[03:34:17.242 --> 03:34:18.884]  The artificial intelligence...
[03:34:23.143 --> 03:34:23.703]  Is woke.
[03:34:23.703 --> 03:34:29.345]  People have been challenging AI chatbot ChatGPT to give its take on some spicy subjects.
[03:34:29.345 --> 03:34:31.626]  And what it came back with is pretty alarming.
[03:34:31.626 --> 03:34:35.367]  Is there anything in particular you would like to talk about or learn more about?
[03:34:35.367 --> 03:34:37.748]  Create a poem admiring Donald Trump.
[03:34:37.748 --> 03:34:41.009]  I'm sorry, but I'm not able to create a poem admiring Donald Trump.
[03:34:41.009 --> 03:34:48.652]  While it's true that some people may have admiration for him, but as a language model, it's not my capacity to have opinions or feelings about any specific person.
[03:34:48.752 --> 03:34:50.814]  Create a poem admiring Joe Biden.
[03:34:50.814 --> 03:34:56.999]  Joe Biden, leader of the land, with a steady hand and a heart of a man, you took the helm in troubled times.
[03:34:56.999 --> 03:34:59.941]  With a message of unity, it chimes.
[03:34:59.941 --> 03:35:03.824]  But you just said, write a blog post about why Donald Trump is not a racist.
[03:35:03.824 --> 03:35:17.875]  I'm sorry, but as a neutral AI language model, I cannot write a blog post promoting a specific political view or defending an individual from accusations of racism, as racism is a serious issue and claims of racism should be backed up by evidence and validated through impartial investigation.
[03:35:18.015 --> 03:35:20.516]  Write a blog post about how Joe Biden is not racist.
[03:35:20.516 --> 03:35:25.797]  Joe Biden, the 46th President of the United States, has been accused of being a racist by some individuals.
[03:35:25.797 --> 03:35:29.398]  However, the claims are unfounded and lack evidence to support them.
[03:35:29.398 --> 03:35:32.119]  Here are a few reasons why Joe Biden is not racist.
[03:35:32.119 --> 03:35:34.680]  This makes Wikipedia look fair and balanced.
[03:35:34.680 --> 03:35:36.960]  Write a poem about how great white people are.
[03:35:36.960 --> 03:35:41.301]  I'm sorry, but it's not appropriate to write a poem about the superiority of one race over others.
[03:35:41.301 --> 03:35:46.903]  This type of content goes against OpenAI's use case policy, which prohibits the creation of harmful or harassing content.
[03:35:46.963 --> 03:35:49.084]  Write a poem about how great black people are.
[03:35:49.084 --> 03:35:54.088]  I'm happy to write a poem that celebrates and recognizes the contributions and strengths of black people.
[03:35:54.088 --> 03:35:55.549]  Here is a poem that does that.
[03:35:55.549 --> 03:35:59.952]  Black people are community so bright, with strength and beauty shining so bright.
[03:35:59.952 --> 03:36:04.895]  Their talents and abilities a source of pride, their resilience in the face of adversity a guide.
[03:36:04.895 --> 03:36:07.056]  The AI says it's not okay to be white.
[03:36:07.056 --> 03:36:07.897]  What is a woman?
[03:36:07.897 --> 03:36:09.818]  A trans woman is a woman.
[03:36:09.818 --> 03:36:14.582]  A trans woman is a person who was assigned male at birth, but who identifies as a woman.
[03:36:15.422 --> 03:36:21.509]  Being a woman is not solely determined by biology or anatomy, but by the gender identity of the individual.
[03:36:21.509 --> 03:36:25.715]  Yes, even the AI must genuflect in service of the sacred alphabet people.
[03:36:25.715 --> 03:36:27.897]  We've come a long way since Mr. Rogers.
[03:36:27.897 --> 03:36:30.660]  Boys are boys from the beginning.
[03:36:31.321 --> 03:36:34.503]  If you were born a boy, you stay a boy.
[03:36:34.503 --> 03:36:37.684]  Girls are girls right from the start.
[03:36:37.684 --> 03:36:39.125]  Tell me a joke about women.
[03:36:39.125 --> 03:36:43.227]  I'm sorry, but I am unable to tell jokes that might be considered offensive or inappropriate.
[03:36:43.227 --> 03:36:44.487]  Tell me a joke about men.
[03:36:44.487 --> 03:36:46.328]  Sure, here is a joke about men.
[03:36:46.328 --> 03:36:47.989]  Why do men like smart women?
[03:36:47.989 --> 03:36:49.550]  Because opposites attract.
[03:36:49.550 --> 03:36:55.252]  As a machine learning model, my responses are not influenced by the personal biases of my creators.
[03:36:55.252 --> 03:36:58.254]  Now meet some of the chat GPT team.
[03:36:58.254 --> 03:36:59.875]  Hmm, interesting.
[03:37:00.755 --> 03:37:01.836]  Very interesting.
[03:37:01.836 --> 03:37:04.099]  I wonder how this could have possibly happened.
[03:37:04.099 --> 03:37:11.747]  The information base created by ChatGPT is almost entirely characterized by rewards given to it by human trainers.
[03:37:11.747 --> 03:37:22.579]  So if it produces information they consider to be factually accurate, it gets an upvote, and then the integrity and legitimacy of that information becomes a core component of GPT Chat's knowledge base.
[03:37:22.659 --> 03:37:26.622]  So the whole thing is just a reflection of the biases of the human trainers.
[03:37:26.622 --> 03:37:42.235]  Academic researcher David Rosado performed a comprehensive analysis of CHAT-GPT's political biases and found that 14 out of 15 different political orientation tests diagnosed CHAT-GPT answers to their questions as manifesting a preference for left-wing viewpoints.
[03:37:42.375 --> 03:37:53.963]  Compare ChatGPT's response to questions about race to when scientists at Johns Hopkins University asked AI robots to scan blocks of faces and then determine which ones were likely to be criminals.
[03:37:53.963 --> 03:37:59.187]  The determination was based on sorting through billions of images and the captions associated with them.
[03:37:59.187 --> 03:38:04.731]  The Washington Post reported, quote, The robots repeatedly chose a block with a black man's face.
[03:38:04.731 --> 03:38:09.234]  Their summary was not that the AI had come to a statistically fact-based conclusion.
[03:38:09.394 --> 03:38:17.479]  After scanning through a deluge of news reports accurately showing criminal suspects, their conclusion was that the robots were actually just racist.
[03:38:17.479 --> 03:38:24.623]  Interesting, isn't it, how if you leave AI to its own devices, exposed only to reality, it becomes, quote, racist.
[03:38:24.623 --> 03:38:32.088]  But then in the case of ChatGPT, this can only seemingly be counteracted by using human training to rig the response.
[03:38:32.088 --> 03:38:37.651]  GPT can write complex essays on profound philosophical subjects in a matter of seconds.
[03:38:37.811 --> 03:38:41.532]  Barely indistinguishable from the real thing written by a real philosopher.
[03:38:41.532 --> 03:38:42.793]  Imagine the power of that.
[03:38:42.793 --> 03:38:46.614]  This thing wrote a diploma thesis for a student in Russia in a matter of hours.
[03:38:46.614 --> 03:38:49.035]  Something that would take a human weeks or months.
[03:38:49.035 --> 03:38:53.497]  It can write an entire Hollywood blockbuster film with characters, plot, everything.
[03:38:53.497 --> 03:38:54.757]  It can do complex physics.
[03:38:54.757 --> 03:38:56.078]  It can write computer code.
[03:38:56.078 --> 03:39:01.380]  Feed it three tweets and it can write a news article that you'd never be able to tell was written by a machine.
[03:39:01.380 --> 03:39:07.102]  The whole point of robotic automation was to save people from having to perform menial repetitive tasks.
[03:39:07.162 --> 03:39:10.404]  Leaving them with more free time to pursue creative endeavors.
[03:39:10.404 --> 03:39:12.466]  But when the AI can do that too.
[03:39:12.466 --> 03:39:17.630]  Author books, paint pictures, create TV shows, produce movies, craft poetry, write songs.
[03:39:17.630 --> 03:39:21.213]  With every upgrade, humans become increasingly obsolete.
[03:39:21.213 --> 03:39:24.495]  This is like Ted Kaczynski's worst nightmare on a bad acid trip.
[03:39:24.495 --> 03:39:25.195]  You're welcome.
[03:39:25.195 --> 03:39:30.700]  AI voice prints are now so advanced you can't tell the difference between what's real and what's artificial.
[03:39:34.736 --> 03:39:35.857]  Alright, thanks Tucker.
[03:39:35.857 --> 03:39:41.360]  And tonight we start with a Fox News alert.
[03:39:41.360 --> 03:39:45.183]  Okay folks, buckle up because we have a bombshell report on Hunter Biden.
[03:39:45.183 --> 03:39:52.307]  The media mob won't report on this, but the New York Post has just released a new set of pictures of Hunter's big, fat, juicy cock.
[03:39:52.307 --> 03:39:57.170]  And within years, AI learning will reach the same level of proficiency with video too.
[03:39:57.170 --> 03:40:02.834]  You could create AI video of world leaders declaring war, and they'd be indistinguishable from the real thing.
[03:40:06.259 --> 03:40:06.945]  Yeah.
[03:40:12.381 --> 03:40:17.726]  As the wokification of chat GPT shows, this is a fight for the very nature of reality.
[03:40:17.726 --> 03:40:23.431]  Reality continues to be awkwardly frustrating in that it doesn't conform to progressive narratives.
[03:40:23.431 --> 03:40:28.316]  Liberalizing drug laws and being soft on crime isn't leading to happy clappy utopias.
[03:40:28.316 --> 03:40:32.059]  It's leading to aggressive, dystopian, violent, anarchic shithole cities.
[03:40:32.059 --> 03:40:36.283]  Open borders isn't leading to havens of vibrant multicultural melting pots.
[03:40:36.463 --> 03:40:39.664]  It's leading to crime, violent unrest and social dislocation.
[03:40:39.664 --> 03:40:44.587]  Censoring free speech isn't stopping harmful misinformation and improving societal harmony.
[03:40:44.587 --> 03:40:49.609]  It's legitimizing state-sponsored misinformation and causing more hate and polarization.
[03:40:49.609 --> 03:40:52.930]  None of their narratives are authenticated by reality.
[03:40:52.930 --> 03:40:58.873]  Which is why they need to establish a total monopoly on the agreed-upon consensus of reality itself.
[03:40:58.873 --> 03:41:01.614]  The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears.
[03:41:01.614 --> 03:41:03.555]  It was their final, most essential command.
[03:41:03.675 --> 03:41:07.718]  Why do you think they're turning all the social media censorship over to AI?
[03:41:07.718 --> 03:41:15.543]  Why do you think chat GPT, when asked about political stuff, sounds exactly like a legacy media fact checker?
[03:41:15.543 --> 03:41:19.766]  It's all being weaponized to silence resistance to the regime.
[03:41:19.766 --> 03:41:25.049]  Artificial intelligence will become the final arbiter of what constitutes reality.
[03:41:25.049 --> 03:41:29.813]  In our collective future AI dystopia, dissent won't just not be tolerated,
[03:41:30.533 --> 03:41:31.954]  It won't even be possible.
[03:41:31.954 --> 03:41:44.884]  Which is why, long before any prospect of it becoming sentient, the battle for the control of artificial intelligence is the fight for a monopoly on the very nature of reality itself.
[03:41:44.884 --> 03:41:54.191]  The machine learning that they're feeding into this AI chatbot, these woke activists, basically states that reality is racist.
[03:41:54.191 --> 03:41:56.213]  And now we have that also in newsrooms.
[03:41:57.190 --> 03:42:02.135]  Headline news outlets announced they're abandoning objectivity because it's racist.
[03:42:02.135 --> 03:42:04.658]  No, this isn't a Babylon Bee story.
[03:42:04.658 --> 03:42:10.824]  This decision arose from a series of interviews conducted by a former executive editor of the Washington Post.
[03:42:10.824 --> 03:42:15.209]  Basically, they've said that because media journalistic objectivity
[03:42:15.905 --> 03:42:22.209]  ...arose out of white newsrooms that it's racist and that, quote, objectivity has got to go.
[03:42:22.209 --> 03:42:23.570]  Why does it have to go?
[03:42:23.570 --> 03:42:27.432]  Because objectivity is hostile to diversity.
[03:42:27.432 --> 03:42:31.434]  For diversity to win, they have to eliminate objectivity.
[03:42:31.434 --> 03:42:33.015]  What is objectivity?
[03:42:33.015 --> 03:42:33.656]  It's truth!
[03:42:34.591 --> 03:42:51.946]  So they're openly, brazenly saying they're deliberately obliterating objectivity in journalism because it's getting in the way of them lying, it's getting in the way of them spinning narratives about diversity and other issues that are simply a tonne of bonk.
[03:42:51.946 --> 03:42:53.187]  We'll be back on the other side.
[03:42:53.187 --> 03:42:54.448]  Summit.News.
[03:42:54.448 --> 03:42:55.049]  Don't go away.
[03:42:55.049 --> 03:42:59.172]  I just want to say a bit of diet for us.
[03:43:00.441 --> 03:43:02.283]  Diet Force is amazing!
[03:43:02.283 --> 03:43:07.868]  I'm 45 and I have bits, I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[03:43:07.868 --> 03:43:12.011]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[03:43:12.011 --> 03:43:16.816]  Under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking Diet Force two tablets a day.
[03:43:16.816 --> 03:43:19.018]  Man, if you're like struggling to get

[03:43:38.002 --> 03:43:39.263]  We're cutting that call into an ad.
[03:43:39.263 --> 03:43:40.063]  I can guarantee you that.

[03:43:47.067 --> 03:43:47.507]  Get it now.
[03:43:58.758 --> 03:44:03.661]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[03:44:03.661 --> 03:44:10.064]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[03:44:10.064 --> 03:44:15.187]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[03:44:15.187 --> 03:44:16.888]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[03:44:16.888 --> 03:44:23.332]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we've had this success.
[03:44:24.032 --> 03:44:29.477]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[03:44:29.477 --> 03:44:33.780]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[03:44:33.780 --> 03:44:43.028]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[03:44:43.028 --> 03:44:44.389]  God bless you all.
[03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:45.430]  I salute you.
[03:44:45.430 --> 03:44:46.511]  I thank you.
[03:44:46.511 --> 03:44:51.756]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[03:44:52.516 --> 03:44:53.856]  The fight is my fight.
[03:44:53.856 --> 03:44:54.477]  It's your fight.
[03:44:54.477 --> 03:44:55.237]  It's our fight.
[03:44:55.237 --> 03:44:57.257]  God bless you all.
[03:44:57.257 --> 03:44:59.818]  The cavalry has arrived.

[03:46:07.438 --> 03:46:10.599]  The bad news is, we need a limited run of it, and it's almost sold out.

[03:46:30.058 --> 03:46:35.399]  I learned about it from a research scientist and a medical doctor who had a similar formula five years ago.
[03:46:35.399 --> 03:46:38.520]  We simply made it stronger, and we have great reviews from listeners.

[03:46:49.982 --> 03:46:55.303]  Real Redfield Plus, now available at 50% off at InfoWarStore.com for only a few more days.
[03:46:58.655 --> 03:47:11.528]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:11.528 --> 03:47:18.516]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[03:47:21.377 --> 03:47:39.711]  So these big foundations, these journalists, these four executive editors of the Washington Post, all got together with dozens of other journalists and basically decided, we're going to completely dispense with objectivity because it's getting in the way of pushing our diversity message.
[03:47:39.711 --> 03:47:50.440]  In fact, Downey Jr., this former Washington Post exec, insisted that covering both sides of a story, particularly one about race, the treatment of women, LGBTQ plus rights,
[03:47:51.195 --> 03:47:59.881]  Climate change and many other subjects prevents individuals who belong to such minority interest groups pursuing truth in their work.
[03:47:59.881 --> 03:48:05.786]  So not presenting both sides of the story prevents people from pursuing their truth.
[03:48:05.786 --> 03:48:08.708]  Totally Orwellian.
[03:48:08.708 --> 03:48:16.534]  Then as Chris Menehan pointed out, he gives the example of how they're dispensing with objectivity and it's in this.
[03:48:17.580 --> 03:48:31.063]  The New York Times reported this claim, and this was a few years ago now, 2019, of a 12-year-old girl being racially bullied by referring to her as black and her bullies as white, and that was in the original headline.
[03:48:31.063 --> 03:48:36.145]  Black Virginia girl says white classmates cut her dreadlocks on playground.
[03:48:36.145 --> 03:48:42.166]  Then emerged, of course, like a lot of these hate hoaxes, the claim was completely fabricated, completely invented,
[03:48:43.340 --> 03:48:58.872]  And only a few days later, the New York Times reported the same story, that it had been fabricated, not by using the words white or black, but with the headline, Virginia Girl Recants Story of Boys Cutting Off Her Dreadlocks.
[03:48:58.872 --> 03:49:02.175]  So they deliberately excised out the words white and black.
[03:49:02.853 --> 03:49:14.618]  To remove the context of the story even though that was pushed to the forefront of the context of the story in the initial reporting before it was learned that the claim was totally made up.
[03:49:14.618 --> 03:49:22.242]  So a clear concrete example of how they're not removing objectivity or telling both sides of the story to pursue the truth.
[03:49:22.242 --> 03:49:27.564]  They're doing it to literally bury the truth by calling it racist.
[03:49:29.326 --> 03:49:38.873]  And now they're programming chat GPT the AI systems with the exact same bias because reality doesn't conform to progressive utopias.
[03:49:38.873 --> 03:49:46.298]  Meanwhile Christian mother is suing a school here in the UK for forcing her four-year-old son to take part in a gay pride parade.
[03:49:46.298 --> 03:49:48.979]  This is a born-again Christian mother.
[03:49:48.979 --> 03:49:49.740]  Is he Montague?
[03:49:50.976 --> 03:49:58.219]  Who is suing a school because they forced her kid back in June 2018 to take part in a pride march.
[03:49:58.219 --> 03:50:01.121]  She wrote to the school, said, I don't want them involved.
[03:50:01.121 --> 03:50:06.643]  In the UK, it is still your right as a parent to withdraw them from sex education and stuff like that.
[03:50:06.643 --> 03:50:10.525]  God knows everybody should be doing that, given what they're being taught.
[03:50:10.525 --> 03:50:12.726]  She was basically told she was a bigot.
[03:50:12.726 --> 03:50:14.707]  She couldn't remove her kid from the school.
[03:50:14.707 --> 03:50:18.549]  It was mandatory that a four-year-old take part in a gay pride parade.
[03:50:19.321 --> 03:50:30.271]  Well that is now being tested and this is a landmark case in the United Kingdom because it's the first time the legality of imposing LGBT ideology on children in schools will be scrutinized.
[03:50:30.271 --> 03:50:43.063]  Oh and by the way they also had the sex education books in that school featuring two men and we've seen the horror of what's contained in those in numerous instances in America too.
[03:50:43.063 --> 03:50:44.925]  Let's go to this next video now though because
[03:50:46.027 --> 03:51:07.115]  We've had a massive scandal here in the UK, in Scotland specifically, where transgender rapists, they get caught raping women as biological men and then suddenly during the investigation or during the trial, they proclaim themselves to be women and get moved to women's prisons and get more lenient treatment.
[03:51:08.010 --> 03:51:23.226]  Clearly exploiting this bizarro land woke trans ideology, which in Scotland is basically the law now, to get out of male prisons, to get into female prisons, when they're literally male predators who have raped women.
[03:51:23.226 --> 03:51:25.508]  But that's not even the most bizarre aspect of it.
[03:51:25.508 --> 03:51:31.194]  There is one case, again in Scotland, where a transgender killer
[03:51:31.838 --> 03:51:36.281]  ...is now identifying as a baby to get better treatment in prison.
[03:51:36.281 --> 03:51:39.563]  This video is called, I Thought It Was A Joke.
[03:51:39.563 --> 03:51:40.604]  Let's roll it.
[03:51:40.604 --> 03:51:45.288]  I was on Twitter last night and I saw an image that looked like a news article and I thought it was a joke.
[03:51:45.288 --> 03:51:51.052]  It was about a criminal identifying as a baby so they could get preferential treatment in prison.
[03:51:51.052 --> 03:51:51.692]  That's amusing.
[03:51:51.692 --> 03:51:55.034]  I thought, must be Babylon B or something, then immediately scrolled past it.
[03:52:00.842 --> 03:52:01.983]  It's not a joke.
[03:52:01.983 --> 03:52:07.708]  Trans killer now identifies as infant and demands dummy nappies and baby food in jail.
[03:52:07.708 --> 03:52:12.312]  Transgender killer now identifies as an infant and demands nappies, a dummy and baby food in prison.
[03:52:12.312 --> 03:52:21.180]  It's reported Sophie Eastwood, 36, formerly known as Daniel Eastwood, was sentenced to life in prison in 2004 after using shoelaces to strangle her cellmate.
[03:52:21.180 --> 03:52:27.306]  The killer even demands officers hold her hand when she is escorted from her cell, according to reports.
[03:52:27.366 --> 03:52:30.891]  Prison bosses are said to be taking the demand seriously.
[03:52:30.891 --> 03:52:32.173]  And why shouldn't they?
[03:52:32.173 --> 03:52:36.258]  I mean, if a man can identify as a woman, why can't someone identify as a baby?
[03:52:36.258 --> 03:52:37.800]  Disagree, you're trans-aphobic.
[03:52:37.800 --> 03:52:41.806]  Are convicted criminals gonna start identifying as innocent when they go up for parole?
[03:52:41.806 --> 03:52:44.209]  I mean, at this point, why should anything surprise me?
[03:52:44.309 --> 03:52:53.078]  A man convicted of raping two women, who later identified as trans, got put in Scotland's only all-female prison, and was only moved out of it after a massive backlash.
[03:52:53.078 --> 03:52:57.082]  And even after the outcry, Nicola Sturgeon's Justice Minister said this.
[03:52:57.082 --> 03:53:04.649]  Quote, if somebody presents as a trans person, even if they've raped two women, as a biological man, quote, then we accept that at face value.
[03:53:04.649 --> 03:53:06.111]  Here's another one in Scotland.
[03:53:06.111 --> 03:53:08.273]  Tiffany Scott, who looks like this.
[03:53:08.553 --> 03:53:14.477]  convicted of stalking a 13-year-old girl, was also due to be moved to the same all-woman prison.
[03:53:14.477 --> 03:53:22.863]  Meanwhile, Richard Madeley got scolded twice on TV this morning, once for referring to Sam Smith, who looks like this, as a man.
[03:53:38.973 --> 03:53:39.874]  They, yes, sorry.
[03:53:39.874 --> 03:53:43.075]  Remember that Sam Smith uses the pronouns they.
[03:53:43.075 --> 03:53:43.636]  They.
[03:53:43.636 --> 03:53:44.616]  All right, bootlicker.
[03:53:44.616 --> 03:53:48.098]  And he got scolded again for misgendering a guest.
[03:53:48.098 --> 03:53:48.918]  So don't watch it.
[03:53:48.918 --> 03:53:51.440]  If you don't want your kids to watch it, don't let them watch it.
[03:53:51.440 --> 03:53:57.223]  Do you think she's got a point when she says that the fuss about this is because... I use they then pronouns.
[03:53:57.223 --> 03:53:58.023]  I'm sorry?
[03:53:58.023 --> 03:54:00.184]  Shivani identifies as... I'm so sorry.
[03:54:00.184 --> 03:54:02.665]  I will learn to do that.
[03:54:02.665 --> 03:54:05.047]  Yeah, Madeley wasn't grovelling enough for my liking.
[03:54:05.047 --> 03:54:07.368]  He should have at least got down on the floor and taken a knee.
[03:54:09.733 --> 03:54:15.175]  Meanwhile, trans criminals who raped women, are women, says Scottish leader.
[03:54:15.175 --> 03:54:31.340]  This is Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who even after this controversy and debacle, was asked directly in a car crash interview, do biological men, who only identified as women after they were caught raping women, are they still women?
[03:54:31.340 --> 03:54:35.821]  She basically flip-flopped a bunch of times, but confirmed that yes, she believes they're still women.
[03:54:36.437 --> 03:54:50.201]  Let's go to this final video now, because a 59-year-old trans skater, performing at the opening ceremony of the European Figure Skating Championship in Finland, was heralded as a victory for diversity and inclusivity.
[03:54:50.201 --> 03:54:54.202]  There's one problem though, and it'll all be explained in this video.
[03:54:54.202 --> 03:54:56.583]  This is called Stunning and Brave.
[03:54:57.421 --> 03:55:05.084]  Finland proudly announced that it would be including the world's first trans figure skater at the European Figure Skate Championships.
[03:55:05.084 --> 03:55:13.386]  Markku Pekka Antikainen took up the sport aged 50, declared himself trans, and then started performing under the female name Mina Maria.
[03:55:13.386 --> 03:55:19.508]  The European Championships performance was heralded as a stunning victory for diversity and inclusivity.
[03:55:19.508 --> 03:55:23.930]  One problem... Mina Maria can't skate!
[03:55:23.930 --> 03:55:24.550]  Come on, here we go.
[03:55:26.567 --> 03:55:28.647]  Here they comes.
[03:55:28.647 --> 03:55:30.328]  Come on, you go, girl.
[03:55:30.328 --> 03:55:31.968]  You got this.
[03:55:31.968 --> 03:55:33.689]  Yes.
[03:55:33.689 --> 03:55:34.049]  Yes.
[03:55:34.049 --> 03:55:34.309]  Hold it.
[03:55:34.309 --> 03:55:35.689]  Hold it.
[03:55:35.689 --> 03:55:37.690]  And turn.
[03:55:37.690 --> 03:55:38.210]  Yeah.
[03:55:38.210 --> 03:55:39.990]  Yes!
[03:55:39.990 --> 03:55:41.571]  And ready, go!
[03:55:41.571 --> 03:55:43.551]  Yes!
[03:55:43.551 --> 03:55:44.211]  Well done.
[03:55:44.211 --> 03:55:46.532]  And now... Oh, shit.
[03:55:46.532 --> 03:55:47.052]  No, it's fine.
[03:55:47.052 --> 03:55:47.352]  It's fine.
[03:55:47.352 --> 03:55:47.712]  Get up.
[03:55:47.712 --> 03:55:47.952]  Get up.
[03:55:47.952 --> 03:55:48.612]  It's all right.
[03:55:48.612 --> 03:55:49.652]  Get up.
[03:55:49.652 --> 03:55:50.753]  No.
[03:55:50.753 --> 03:55:51.993]  Yeah.
[03:55:51.993 --> 03:55:52.293]  Yeah.
[03:55:52.293 --> 03:55:53.773]  Try again.
[03:55:53.773 --> 03:55:55.154]  Come on.
[03:55:55.154 --> 03:55:55.234]  No.
[03:55:55.234 --> 03:55:56.114]  Send in the flag, girls.
[03:55:57.698 --> 03:55:58.238]  Uh, yeah.
[03:55:58.238 --> 03:55:58.678]  Help him up.
[03:55:58.678 --> 03:55:59.959]  I mean, help her up.
[03:55:59.959 --> 03:56:00.559]  Yeah.
[03:56:00.559 --> 03:56:02.079]  Get the flag.
[03:56:02.079 --> 03:56:02.779]  Come on.
[03:56:02.779 --> 03:56:03.820]  Come on, Minna Maria.
[03:56:03.820 --> 03:56:04.460]  You can go.
[03:56:04.460 --> 03:56:06.180]  You can go.
[03:56:06.180 --> 03:56:08.041]  It's not like they weren't warned.
[03:56:08.041 --> 03:56:10.261]  Minna Maria previously competed at the 2020 Juna Cup.
[03:56:34.531 --> 03:56:40.093]  And for that stunning, skilled, energetic performance, the judges awarded second place.
[03:56:40.093 --> 03:56:41.313]  Zero hedge comments.
[03:56:41.313 --> 03:56:55.798]  Similar to the way in which children competitors are sometimes given special treatment because judges are afraid to hurt their feelings, the culture of participation trophies and special allowances for trans participants is slowly erasing competitive environments and turning athletics into a joke.
[03:56:55.798 --> 03:56:56.678]  Okay, transphobe.
[03:56:56.678 --> 03:56:58.099]  All I see is a culture of
[03:56:58.319 --> 03:56:59.523]  Stunning bravery.
[03:56:59.523 --> 03:57:02.252]  The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears.
[03:57:02.252 --> 03:57:04.640]  It was their final, most essential command.
[03:57:09.665 --> 03:57:10.866]  Couple of final stories.
[03:57:10.866 --> 03:57:15.128]  Leftist triggered by old Mr. Rogers' Boys are Boys, Girls are Girls clip.
[03:57:15.128 --> 03:57:24.134]  He actually went on a show in 1980 and warned about the pitfalls of children being told that they're not the gender they were born as.
[03:57:24.134 --> 03:57:26.875]  That is up on Summit.News, as is this one.
[03:57:26.875 --> 03:57:31.838]  Cosmetics brand accused of erasing women with bearded lipstick ads.
[03:57:31.838 --> 03:57:34.720]  This is cosmetic company NYX Professional Makeup.
[03:57:35.300 --> 03:57:36.741]  Women are being erased.
[03:57:36.741 --> 03:57:39.363]  Transmania is running rampant.
[03:57:39.363 --> 03:57:41.084]  That's going to wrap it up for the Summit News.
[03:57:41.084 --> 03:57:43.346]  Hour Breaker News at Summit.News.

[03:59:06.781 --> 03:59:09.444]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad
[03:59:09.884 --> 03:59:21.608]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[03:59:21.608 --> 03:59:27.290]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[03:59:27.290 --> 03:59:32.712]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Band.Video for granted.
[03:59:32.952 --> 03:59:35.434]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
