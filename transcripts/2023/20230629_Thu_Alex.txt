[00:00:15.963 --> 00:00:17.084]  InfoWars.
[00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:18.284]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:18.625]  Today.
[00:00:54.838 --> 00:01:07.346]  Ex-Head of Respiratory Research at Pfizer, Mike Yeadon, and researchers including Craig Pardecouper, have sourced VAERS data on vaccine death and injury in the U.S.
[00:01:07.346 --> 00:01:15.612]  A database of over 700,000 adverse reactions caused by the Moderna, Pfizer, and Janssen vaccines.
[00:01:15.612 --> 00:01:21.056]  These vaccines have been deployed in different batches, officially referred to as LOTS.
[00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:29.519]  This has allowed Yeadon's team to back-engineer Big Pharma's COVID-19 vaccine deployment agenda in the U.S.
[00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:36.022]  All their information is published at howbadismybatch.com and howbad.info.
[00:01:36.022 --> 00:01:38.523]  And what we learn is quite telling.
[00:01:38.523 --> 00:01:48.947]  About 0.5% of all the different batches are highly toxic, resulting in hospitalization, disability, and death within days or weeks of injection.
[00:01:49.787 --> 00:01:55.852]  Other batches cause minimal adverse reactions and most appear to be harmless placebos.
[00:01:55.852 --> 00:02:05.340]  When plotting on a timeline, we can see that these three companies have been working together to quietly monitor the lethal effectiveness of specific deadly batches.
[00:02:06.505 --> 00:02:20.756]  While one company is deploying a lethal batch, the other two deploy harmless ones, creating the scientific environment to perform dose range finding, or the maximum tolerated dose for each specific batch.
[00:02:20.756 --> 00:02:32.345]  The timeline shows that each lethal batch deployment is preceded and followed by a quiet period, allowing them time to establish their baseline before the next deadly batch is deployed.
[00:02:33.306 --> 00:02:40.932]  Private leaked documents from the CDC show a list of expiry dates and only certain lots are included.
[00:02:40.932 --> 00:02:45.856]  The very same lots found to be highly toxic in part of Cooper's database.
[00:02:45.856 --> 00:02:47.057]  Which makes sense.
[00:02:47.057 --> 00:02:51.801]  There would be no reason to list expiration dates for saline placebo.
[00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:52.781]  Only the deadly ones.
[00:02:53.965 --> 00:03:03.557]  This mode of deployment allows governments the ability to direct deadly batches into specific populations, such as red states.
[00:03:03.557 --> 00:03:13.088]  Analysis of the number of dying per 100,000 vaccinated in 50 states shows us that the overwhelming majority of vaccine deaths are happening in red states.
[00:03:14.204 --> 00:03:20.169]  Some red states are experiencing 11 times more vaccine deaths than other states.
[00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:26.193]  On average, red states are experiencing twice the amount of vaccine death and injuries than blue states.
[00:03:26.193 --> 00:03:36.742]  After ruling out other possibilities, Parda-Cooper concluded that this can only be due to the fact that red states received at least twice as much of the lethal batches than blue states did.
[00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:50.640]  Among several other crimes, they are tipping the scales of the democratic process by killing people who voted against the New World Order's woke, build back better, great reset.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.885]  While at the same time, endlessly flooding the borders with unvaccinated foreigners.
[00:03:56.885 --> 00:04:00.007]  And it's happening right now.
[00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:02.089]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:14.301 --> 00:04:22.524]  Alright, it's Thursday, June 29th, 2023, and I just aired that Gregg Reeves report from a year and a half ago.
[00:04:22.524 --> 00:04:26.186]  And that report is a report I've aired more than any other report in the last year and a half.
[00:04:26.186 --> 00:04:29.967]  We've probably aired that 15 times at least.
[00:04:29.967 --> 00:04:32.768]  Now why have we aired that report 15 times?
[00:04:32.768 --> 00:04:34.509]  Because it was independent U.S.
[00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:42.772]  researchers that early on went and studied the adverse reaction reports and the different regions, and then the lot numbers on those.
[00:04:43.453 --> 00:04:50.142]  And they found that in certain regions, you would have massive illness and side effect in death rates.
[00:04:50.142 --> 00:04:52.605]  And then in other areas, you would have moderate.
[00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:54.447]  And in other areas, you'd have zero.
[00:04:54.447 --> 00:04:56.190]  Zero.
[00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.473]  Now, this was confirmed a year and a half ago.
[00:04:58.473 --> 00:04:59.314]  Really, two years ago.
[00:05:00.563 --> 00:05:05.266]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.
[00:05:05.266 --> 00:05:07.247]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[00:05:07.247 --> 00:05:09.288]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[00:05:09.288 --> 00:05:11.770]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.570]  Hey, what's better?
[00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.431]  Knockout.
[00:05:13.431 --> 00:05:14.772]  What's better?
[00:05:14.772 --> 00:05:15.512]  Down and out.
[00:05:15.512 --> 00:05:16.032]  What's better?
[00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:18.314]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:05:18.314 --> 00:05:23.237]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:27.901]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:29.222]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:05:29.222 --> 00:05:30.524]  They're all very diverse.
[00:05:30.524 --> 00:05:40.713]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.
[00:05:41.454 --> 00:05:51.619]  This is a great formula, full of amazing safe compounds, give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep, and it's in stock, available right now, of 25% off, out of the gates.
[00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:55.361]  So get your InfoWars MD, good night's sleep today, at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:07.902 --> 00:06:12.884]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:12.884 --> 00:06:24.587]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[00:06:24.587 --> 00:06:24.868]  June 29th, 2023.
[00:06:27.332 --> 00:06:29.193]  And the globalists are bringers of death.
[00:06:29.193 --> 00:06:34.337]  They are engaging in massive depopulation operations and crimes against humanity.
[00:06:34.337 --> 00:06:40.802]  They're standardizing and normalizing the mass killing and murder to a sterilization of our species.
[00:06:40.802 --> 00:06:43.664]  They are playing God.
[00:06:43.664 --> 00:06:45.565]  Now, I got up early this morning.
[00:06:45.565 --> 00:06:46.406]  I was doing research.
[00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:51.950]  I went to Infowars.com and got hit by a thunderbolt of information.
[00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.333]  And then I got hit by a thunderbolt of anger, not at the enemy,
[00:06:56.894 --> 00:06:58.875]  But it myself.
[00:06:58.875 --> 00:07:01.836]  I have a problem, you have a problem, we all have a problem.
[00:07:01.836 --> 00:07:07.038]  And it's that we don't stay focused, and we don't think long term, and we don't think back historically as well.
[00:07:07.038 --> 00:07:09.799]  We don't have 35,000 foot views.
[00:07:09.799 --> 00:07:11.260]  We have one inch away views.
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.641]  You can't tell it's an elephant when you're one inch away from its hind end.
[00:07:14.641 --> 00:07:17.282]  We got to pull back and look at the full compendium.
[00:07:17.282 --> 00:07:22.724]  Now it was two years ago that they started the poison shots, two plus years ago.
[00:07:22.724 --> 00:07:24.285]  In three and a half years, this nightmare began.
[00:07:25.937 --> 00:07:41.382]  And immediately, there were groups and organizations and medical think tanks and watchdogs that tested Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and J&J shots all over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[00:07:41.382 --> 00:07:42.362]  It all happened.
[00:07:42.362 --> 00:07:54.106]  And they found that a certain portion was water, saline solution,
[00:07:55.163 --> 00:07:58.264]  It was around 50%.
[00:07:58.264 --> 00:08:11.649]  And then another 25% or so had a very small amount of the spike protein and the mRNA garbage in it and all the nanolipid, basically fancy, souped up antifreeze in it.
[00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:24.454]  But then around 25%, and it varies country to country, sometimes it's only 5%, of the injections had a super high level that always made people sick and had a very high percentage rate of heart attacks and
[00:08:26.565 --> 00:08:30.007]  Strokes, cancer, sterilization, you name it.
[00:08:30.007 --> 00:08:31.888]  And shedding.
[00:08:31.888 --> 00:08:40.792]  Now, Greg Reese, over a year and a half ago, put up a report titled, Red States Being Targeted by the COVID Shots.
[00:08:40.792 --> 00:08:42.653]  We'll put that on screen, the actual headline.
[00:08:42.653 --> 00:08:43.253]  I'm going from memory.
[00:08:43.253 --> 00:08:46.394]  We're going to air it again in a moment.
[00:08:46.394 --> 00:08:53.958]  And now, since then, more and more research groups and more and more prestigious think tanks and watchdog groups have gone out and studied the shots.
[00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:56.129]  There it is, evidence that U.S.
[00:08:56.129 --> 00:09:01.071]  government targeting red states with deadly batches of vaccine.
[00:09:01.071 --> 00:09:03.832]  Now that is January 11, 2022.
[00:09:03.832 --> 00:09:06.292]  So that's a year and a half ago.
[00:09:06.292 --> 00:09:07.773]  That's a cool 18 months ago.
[00:09:07.773 --> 00:09:10.093]  All right.
[00:09:10.093 --> 00:09:21.216]  Now, since then, more has come out on this, and I see the reports all the time and don't even talk about it, because psychologically and mentally, I already know this.
[00:09:21.216 --> 00:09:22.977]  In fact, as listeners and viewers, you already know this.
[00:09:23.604 --> 00:09:25.926]  But think of the true horror.
[00:09:25.926 --> 00:09:32.912]  It's like if we discovered Jeffrey Dahmer back at the time was kidnapping men and injecting acid in their brains to create lobotomized sex slaves.
[00:09:32.912 --> 00:09:34.233]  And we went, well, we know he's doing it.
[00:09:34.233 --> 00:09:37.255]  We're not going to call the police or go stop him.
[00:09:37.255 --> 00:09:39.877]  And then you just learn, oh, there he is kidnapping another man to do it again.
[00:09:39.877 --> 00:09:42.439]  We're not going to stop him.
[00:09:42.439 --> 00:09:45.101]  Or John Wayne Gacy doing the same thing.
[00:09:45.101 --> 00:09:46.282]  We know they're doing it.
[00:09:46.282 --> 00:09:47.784]  They're gearing up to do it again.
[00:09:47.784 --> 00:09:52.948]  And you may ask, why would J&J, AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer,
[00:09:54.266 --> 00:09:55.946]  Three different types of vaccines.
[00:09:55.946 --> 00:10:04.329]  Pfizer and Moderna are the Pentagon-developed, Fauci-developed, spike protein, nanotech, mRNA system.
[00:10:04.329 --> 00:10:10.650]  The virus vector of AstraZeneca and J&J are two different virus vectors that do the exact same thing and probably were worse.
[00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.031]  That's why they pulled them earlier.
[00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:20.093]  They were so devastating that if you got the shot, if there was actually that compound in there,
[00:10:21.545 --> 00:10:23.946]  And it went in and reprogrammed your cell with a virus.
[00:10:23.946 --> 00:10:25.066]  You were in deep trouble.
[00:10:25.066 --> 00:10:33.409]  So, J&J, AstraZeneca, those got pulled very quick because they were told by the Pentagon, turns out a year before they released COVID, they already developed all this.
[00:10:33.409 --> 00:10:34.470]  Well, there's the patents, the numbers.
[00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.030]  You can look all this up.
[00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.311]  Everything I'm saying, you can look up.
[00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:41.712]  And Dr. David Martin does a great job exposing it, probably the best job.
[00:10:41.712 --> 00:10:42.873]  But it's all in the documents.
[00:10:42.873 --> 00:10:44.593]  This is totally evil, totally psychotic.
[00:10:44.593 --> 00:10:46.854]  And they think we're so dumb, they did it openly.
[00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.172]  Because they wanted to get all the medical systems and governments on board.
[00:10:50.172 --> 00:10:52.854]  We're going to skip this break.
[00:10:52.854 --> 00:11:00.379]  They wanted to do all of this so that they would corrupt everybody and everybody would be involved.
[00:11:00.379 --> 00:11:04.503]  The law firms, the governments, the governments would be signed on to liability protection.
[00:11:04.503 --> 00:11:05.323]  So we know all this.
[00:11:05.323 --> 00:11:08.345]  And you're like, well, why are you talking about it today?
[00:11:08.345 --> 00:11:15.571]  Major European watchdog groups, major European professors, major respected groups that report to the government
[00:11:16.661 --> 00:11:20.602]  Have studied the EU batches.
[00:11:20.602 --> 00:11:31.586]  And not only, if you look at the data, did it target conservative and Christian and elderly areas for death, but it targeted different geographic areas in Europe with more deadly shots.
[00:11:31.586 --> 00:11:35.107]  Now, we knew this.
[00:11:35.107 --> 00:11:41.649]  The left, on average, if the conservative areas, depending on which area they studied, but it varies, it was basically the same numbers.
[00:11:41.649 --> 00:11:43.030]  A conservative red area would get 25%
[00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:45.978]  Souped up, death shot.
[00:11:45.978 --> 00:11:50.061]  Remember, there's placebo, saline solution, salt water.
[00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:50.501]  Does nothing.
[00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:52.182]  In fact, it's good for you, a little bit of it.
[00:11:52.182 --> 00:11:54.804]  There's the same thing you put in your veins, you know, when you're dehydrated.
[00:11:54.804 --> 00:11:56.225]  There's saline.
[00:11:56.225 --> 00:11:59.487]  Same thing your teardrops are.
[00:11:59.487 --> 00:12:01.488]  There's saline.
[00:12:01.488 --> 00:12:07.792]  There is a low-dose system that creates a spike protein.
[00:12:08.715 --> 00:12:14.117]  Orders your body to produce this deadly cancerous, deadly system that your own body attacks and eats holes in your capillaries and arteries.
[00:12:14.117 --> 00:12:16.338]  This is just a psychotic death weapon.
[00:12:16.338 --> 00:12:17.558]  And then there's the third one.
[00:12:17.558 --> 00:12:19.139]  So, the super deadly.
[00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:19.979]  It's really strong.
[00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:25.621]  So, three different systems.
[00:12:25.621 --> 00:12:29.263]  But the Pfizer's two different dose levels in the shot.
[00:12:29.263 --> 00:12:33.104]  And so, they have now gone and looked, and it's the same thing in the U.S.
[00:12:33.104 --> 00:12:35.925]  Conservative areas were literally bombed. 25%.
[00:12:37.944 --> 00:12:42.526]  Leftist areas, around 10% was the super death shot.
[00:12:42.526 --> 00:12:55.390]  So they've actually created a system where they're euthanizing conservatives and Christians through the injections, but if the leftists are all dying, or aren't dying, it becomes obvious, well why aren't they dying?
[00:12:55.390 --> 00:13:05.114]  So okay, they die roughly a third as much, and then if you're in conservative rural areas, like in Austin, Texas, they control it, the study shows they sent the 10% in.
[00:13:06.497 --> 00:13:06.917]  On average.
[00:13:06.917 --> 00:13:08.278]  Remember, you're carpet bombing.
[00:13:08.278 --> 00:13:10.639]  So, they're going to get some of their people too.
[00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:14.240]  But, they're going to miss some conservatives as well.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.022]  So, they... So, this is something like dropping nuclear weapons on cities.
[00:13:17.022 --> 00:13:18.762]  People just don't know they've been hit.
[00:13:18.762 --> 00:13:22.724]  So, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles.
[00:13:22.724 --> 00:13:23.584]  They didn't get hit.
[00:13:23.584 --> 00:13:26.045]  They got hit with a 10%.
[00:13:26.045 --> 00:13:27.126]  Same thing in Australia.
[00:13:27.126 --> 00:13:28.647]  They hit their cities with about a 10%.
[00:13:28.647 --> 00:13:31.028]  Sometimes it's 7%, sometimes it's 12%.
[00:13:31.028 --> 00:13:31.768]  We have all the numbers.
[00:13:31.768 --> 00:13:34.069]  We're going to be, you know, be showing it to you.
[00:13:35.245 --> 00:13:39.366]  Let's put this article up here and just show them some of the graphs out of European countries.
[00:13:39.366 --> 00:13:39.866]  It's all here.
[00:13:39.866 --> 00:13:40.686]  It's a huge report.
[00:13:40.686 --> 00:13:44.026]  Here it is on screen.
[00:13:44.026 --> 00:13:53.688]  This is just them, this watchdog group of prestigious scientists and university professors looking at just Pfizer batches they got.
[00:13:53.688 --> 00:13:55.448]  Same thing with Moderna, same thing with all the others.
[00:13:55.448 --> 00:13:59.349]  Pfizer vaccine batches in the EU were placebo, says scientists.
[00:13:59.349 --> 00:14:02.530]  And then it goes on to say the others were not.
[00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.510]  And then they have the graph here we'll put on screen.
[00:14:05.962 --> 00:14:08.943]  Of the three indicators in three different colors.
[00:14:08.943 --> 00:14:10.223]  So, we'll just scroll down in that article.
[00:14:10.223 --> 00:14:13.905]  Pfizer vaccine matches a new year placebo, say scientists.
[00:14:13.905 --> 00:14:17.406]  We'll just scroll in the article a little bit.
[00:14:17.406 --> 00:14:18.026]  You got to go read this.
[00:14:18.026 --> 00:14:19.646]  You got to see this for yourself.
[00:14:19.646 --> 00:14:22.067]  So, look at the people that got the saline.
[00:14:22.067 --> 00:14:23.347]  That's in yellow.
[00:14:23.347 --> 00:14:24.908]  No adverse responses.
[00:14:24.908 --> 00:14:25.668]  Zero.
[00:14:25.668 --> 00:14:25.928]  Zero.
[00:14:25.928 --> 00:14:28.109]  This is in a sampling group of 800,000.
[00:14:28.109 --> 00:14:31.290]  Okay, this is just one country.
[00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:34.620]  And I'll go to Denmark, Sweden, they looked at them all.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.061]  And it's all the same graph everywhere.
[00:14:36.061 --> 00:14:38.702]  So no one gets sick from saline.
[00:14:38.702 --> 00:14:42.243]  And then look at the people that got the moderate death dose.
[00:14:42.243 --> 00:14:45.285]  It still gets them, but it takes longer and it's much lower.
[00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:48.546]  Now look what happened right away, within just a few days.
[00:14:48.546 --> 00:14:51.047]  If you got the big daddy, you're dead in a week.
[00:14:51.047 --> 00:14:54.749]  That's what Ernest Ramirez and his son got.
[00:14:55.876 --> 00:14:58.878]  Or maybe in the lot, he got a placebo and his son got the shot.
[00:14:58.878 --> 00:15:00.138]  They're all mixed together.
[00:15:00.138 --> 00:15:01.919]  They got different lot numbers.
[00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:05.401]  So, so... There you go!
[00:15:05.401 --> 00:15:06.182]  We gotta ask Ernest.
[00:15:06.182 --> 00:15:08.743]  Did they go together to get the shot, or were they separate?
[00:15:08.743 --> 00:15:10.044]  I imagine they were probably separate.
[00:15:10.044 --> 00:15:11.905]  He went and got one, and his son got the other.
[00:15:11.905 --> 00:15:14.326]  And Ernest Jr., dead in four days like that.
[00:15:14.326 --> 00:15:16.387]  Starts running on the playground?
[00:15:16.387 --> 00:15:17.368]  Bye-bye.
[00:15:17.368 --> 00:15:18.008]  Good shape?
[00:15:18.008 --> 00:15:19.149]  Not overweight?
[00:15:19.149 --> 00:15:20.129]  Bye-bye.
[00:15:20.129 --> 00:15:21.590]  No heart problems?
[00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.031]  Bye-bye.
[00:15:23.031 --> 00:15:23.951]  Bye-bye.
[00:15:23.951 --> 00:15:24.792]  Bye-bye, Bluebird.
[00:15:25.433 --> 00:15:28.576]  Because this is all about their power, their control.
[00:15:28.576 --> 00:15:42.328]  The health departments were set up in England 120 years ago, and here 110 years ago, by the Rockefellers, by the eugenicists at Cold Springs Harbor, that created the Nazis later, literally, to quote, sanitize the races.
[00:15:42.328 --> 00:15:49.214]  And they said, we're going to kill the dumb white people, we're going to kill the dumb black people, we're going to kill everybody, according to their IQ.
[00:15:50.388 --> 00:15:57.493]  And if you got a B- in the Appalachian Mountains in the 20s, they came and sterilized you.
[00:15:57.493 --> 00:15:59.815]  It's the same thing to black people.
[00:15:59.815 --> 00:16:03.258]  And so just know, this is all going on.
[00:16:03.258 --> 00:16:05.800]  So this is a prestigious report.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.562]  What we're showing you is just batches in Denmark.
[00:16:08.562 --> 00:16:12.865]  800,000 plus people looked at by the universities.
[00:16:12.865 --> 00:16:16.848]  This is a prestigious group of scientists and universities, all on record.
[00:16:18.064 --> 00:16:28.294]  Scientists have uncovered startling evidence that a substantial portion of the batches of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine deployed in the European Union may in fact have consisted of placebos.
[00:16:28.294 --> 00:16:29.335]  Oh, may in fact.
[00:16:29.335 --> 00:16:32.658]  The German regulator knew this and did not subject them to quality control testing.
[00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:34.300]  Because it was all part of a plan.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.061]  They already signed off.
[00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:36.142]  And remember, it was unapproved.
[00:16:36.142 --> 00:16:37.223]  And there was nothing.
[00:16:37.223 --> 00:16:40.426]  They wouldn't tell you what was in each shot because it was all variant.
[00:16:41.957 --> 00:17:03.988]  The scientists, Dr. Gerald Diker, Professor of Organic Chemistry at Ruhr University in Bochum, and Dr. Gorg Matiska, Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the University of Leipzig, are part of a group of five German-speaking scientists who have been publicly raising questions about the quality and safety of biotech in a virus, as it's known in Germany, for the last year and a half.
[00:17:03.988 --> 00:17:09.671]  They recently appeared in a bunch of publications, an online program of the German journalist Melenia
[00:17:10.396 --> 00:17:14.237]  Prevrovac to discuss batch vulnerability.
[00:17:14.237 --> 00:17:22.040]  Their startling point was the direct recent Danish study showing enormous variance in the adverse events associated with different batches.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.641]  This is a government.
[00:17:24.641 --> 00:17:27.582]  Governments in the EU are actually doing the same thing in the UK.
[00:17:27.582 --> 00:17:28.703]  Same numbers in the UK, folks.
[00:17:28.703 --> 00:17:30.003]  They actually look at the batches.
[00:17:30.003 --> 00:17:32.804]  We had to go do it here in the US because our loving government keeps that secret.
[00:17:34.904 --> 00:17:36.365]  So, it goes on.
[00:17:36.365 --> 00:17:49.775]  The startling point was the recent Danish study by the government showing enormous variation in the adverse event associated with different batches of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or BNT162b2, per the scientific code name.
[00:17:49.775 --> 00:17:53.737]  The below figure for the Danish study illustrates the variation.
[00:17:53.737 --> 00:17:55.679]  It's a government study, 100,000 people.
[00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:59.081]  Now, you put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[00:17:59.081 --> 00:18:01.083]  Saline, zero problems.
[00:18:01.083 --> 00:18:03.825]  The leak dose, fast death, but, you know, still at 1 in 400.
[00:18:05.379 --> 00:18:06.840]  The other people?
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:07.560]  Everybody.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.380]  Or 80% had adverse reactions.
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.682]  Remember what Bill Gates got asked in a study once the shots started.
[00:18:12.682 --> 00:18:14.402]  They didn't study it before.
[00:18:14.402 --> 00:18:18.344]  The CBS reporter goes, well, Mr. Gates, 80% of people had adverse reactions.
[00:18:18.344 --> 00:18:21.165]  He goes, well, yeah.
[00:18:21.165 --> 00:18:23.265]  That's when they were giving them a straight-up deal.
[00:18:23.265 --> 00:18:25.046]  So the regulators were balking and weren't approving.
[00:18:25.046 --> 00:18:28.347]  So they said, how about we just do saline and we make sure.
[00:18:28.347 --> 00:18:30.628]  And they were able to tell if it's safe or not.
[00:18:30.628 --> 00:18:32.609]  And of course, they knew it wasn't safe from the beginning.
[00:18:32.609 --> 00:18:33.349]  They knew what it was going to do.
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:40.202]  But for people that aren't totally psychotic and evil, but are on power trips, well, we've got to do it for the greater good.
[00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:43.003]  This will save millions of lives, but it will also kill millions.
[00:18:43.003 --> 00:18:48.385]  But we'll learn valuable things, the secret of the universe, but the public's not ready for that yet.
[00:18:48.385 --> 00:18:55.387]  But then, baked into that, the socialist and communist-controlled cities, they don't hit them with a 25% serious adverse reaction.
[00:18:59.412 --> 00:19:00.252]  Shot.
[00:19:00.252 --> 00:19:02.653]  25% in the conservative areas worldwide.
[00:19:02.653 --> 00:19:04.813]  Rural areas of Australia, bombed.
[00:19:04.813 --> 00:19:06.593]  Rural areas of England, bombed.
[00:19:06.593 --> 00:19:08.294]  Rural areas of Scotland, bombed.
[00:19:08.294 --> 00:19:12.335]  Rural areas of... you name it, bombed.
[00:19:12.335 --> 00:19:13.735]  Rural areas of Canada, bombed.
[00:19:13.735 --> 00:19:16.235]  Conservative, and that's how they send the matches.
[00:19:16.235 --> 00:19:22.336]  And Greg Rees shows it in his report from a year and a half ago from the major watchdog groups that collated all the numbers, folks.
[00:19:22.336 --> 00:19:24.837]  Because the numbers are public, but our government doesn't do studies on it.
[00:19:25.367 --> 00:19:26.688]  So it's the same everywhere.
[00:19:26.688 --> 00:19:27.709]  They are bombing us.
[00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:28.589]  They are killing us.
[00:19:28.589 --> 00:19:30.570]  They are literally targeting us.
[00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:31.811]  Your church gets roped into it.
[00:19:31.811 --> 00:19:32.632]  It's a conservative church.
[00:19:32.632 --> 00:19:33.352]  They've been lied to.
[00:19:33.352 --> 00:19:34.813]  They think it's good.
[00:19:34.813 --> 00:19:38.756]  You get the 10 percent, the 30 percent, 25 percent.
[00:19:38.756 --> 00:19:39.736]  They send it out.
[00:19:39.736 --> 00:19:43.018]  So they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:19:43.018 --> 00:19:46.841]  And so the military, oh, the military has just been devastated with the shots.
[00:19:46.841 --> 00:19:53.485]  But strangely enough, special units and the units they do are basically all conservative.
[00:19:53.485 --> 00:19:54.686]  They got the special shots.
[00:19:56.389 --> 00:19:58.050]  Especially deadly ones.
[00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.051]  And everybody else got the placebos.
[00:20:00.051 --> 00:20:02.353]  Or they mix in a little bit of a weak shot.
[00:20:02.353 --> 00:20:04.173]  So there'd be a little sickness, a little death there.
[00:20:04.173 --> 00:20:11.677]  Because it gets a little too obvious when only the Republican counties are keeling over dead.
[00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:13.959]  So think of the level.
[00:20:13.959 --> 00:20:15.960]  The biological weapon systems.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.261]  Let's put today's live show headline up.
[00:20:18.261 --> 00:20:19.141]  I hope you'll share it with everybody.
[00:20:19.141 --> 00:20:20.582]  This is a life and death situation.
[00:20:20.582 --> 00:20:21.322]  This isn't a drill.
[00:20:21.322 --> 00:20:21.903]  It's not a joke.
[00:20:21.903 --> 00:20:22.343]  It's happening.
[00:20:23.271 --> 00:20:27.692]  And this is the reality of what we're facing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:27.692 --> 00:20:31.213]  So again, if you go to InfoWars.com, you always put up a live show feed.
[00:20:31.213 --> 00:20:32.354]  Nightmare Bombshell.
[00:20:32.354 --> 00:20:42.837]  A group of top European scientists have confirmed Pfizer COVID vaccine was a giant biological weapons test.
[00:20:42.837 --> 00:20:45.978]  And ladies and gentlemen, that's what this was.
[00:20:46.741 --> 00:20:49.043]  A giant biological weapons test.
[00:20:49.043 --> 00:21:00.913]  This is a nanotech biological system, whether it's the virus vector or whether it is the mRNA delivery, that orders your cells to replicate the spike protein of the HIV virus.
[00:21:00.913 --> 00:21:06.137]  Now, I know if you're a new listener, that sounds completely insane, like Martians blowing up New York.
[00:21:06.137 --> 00:21:07.979]  Anybody can search engine.
[00:21:07.979 --> 00:21:11.922]  What is the Pfizer mRNA spike protein made of?
[00:21:12.722 --> 00:21:17.424]  And it'll pull up the HIV spike protein that they've learned how to grow in a lab.
[00:21:17.424 --> 00:21:25.689]  It is a synthetic virus mRNA system that keeps replicating like a prion.
[00:21:25.689 --> 00:21:27.750]  It is a prion.
[00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.051]  And what do prions cause?
[00:21:30.051 --> 00:21:32.432]  Little protein crystals that grow in their body.
[00:21:32.432 --> 00:21:34.853]  Spongiform encephalopathy.
[00:21:34.853 --> 00:21:36.694]  Or what causes what?
[00:21:36.694 --> 00:21:38.275]  Bad cow disease.
[00:21:40.054 --> 00:21:41.995]  We have all the insurance company actuaries.
[00:21:41.995 --> 00:21:50.799]  We have all the, one of the top, I mean, he's like, said to me, the top guy was Edward Dowd's whistleblower two and a half years ago.
[00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:52.100]  And he said he'll be coming public soon.
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:58.323]  And he did come public a year later with a bunch of other scientists and experts and statisticians.
[00:21:58.323 --> 00:22:04.866]  And they said, on average, we have a 44% increase in death in the world in Congress that took the shots.
[00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:05.626]  44% increase in death.
[00:22:05.626 --> 00:22:09.448]  Again, it was less than 10% in World War I and World War II, and that killed hundreds of millions of people.
[00:22:10.402 --> 00:22:14.803]  So, you sit back and you look at this.
[00:22:14.803 --> 00:22:18.425]  The magnitude of this information, ladies and gentlemen, is just over the top.
[00:22:18.425 --> 00:22:20.365]  Everyone I know has family that died from a shot.
[00:22:20.365 --> 00:22:24.627]  Everybody that works... or is almost dead.
[00:22:24.627 --> 00:22:26.387]  It's just complete devastation.
[00:22:26.387 --> 00:22:28.628]  I have an assistant and a nanny.
[00:22:28.628 --> 00:22:37.191]  Both of them have family, and one of them had a fiancé that had no heart problems, was an athlete, 25 years old, and now he has...
[00:22:38.624 --> 00:22:40.666]  Byron Carr died of so bad, they say he'll be dead in a couple of years.
[00:22:40.666 --> 00:22:42.147]  He passes out all the time.
[00:22:42.147 --> 00:22:43.328]  Just passes out.
[00:22:43.328 --> 00:22:49.412]  I mean, the other assistant has a family member that took the shot and died three days later of a heart attack.
[00:22:49.412 --> 00:22:50.913]  I was in good shape.
[00:22:50.913 --> 00:22:54.956]  So, I mean, we have anecdotal, we have it all around us.
[00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:56.498]  I could open the phones up here today.
[00:22:56.498 --> 00:23:01.481]  I could open the phones up here today.
[00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:03.843]  And I could just take nothing but calls.
[00:23:03.843 --> 00:23:05.745]  I'd say, hey, call in if you love the shot, it had a great effect.
[00:23:05.745 --> 00:23:06.165]  Nobody calls.
[00:23:08.012 --> 00:23:09.153]  Call and tell us what happened with the shot.
[00:23:09.153 --> 00:23:09.833]  You've heard the days.
[00:23:09.833 --> 00:23:11.895]  We do 3-4 hours of calls, like 50 calls.
[00:23:11.895 --> 00:23:18.920]  Every person talks about what it did to their family or did to them.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.283]  So, that's where we are here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:22.283 --> 00:23:29.368]  So, about three weeks ago, Dr. Peter McCullough, who's a very renowned cardiologist,
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.981]  He was asked last year by Joe Rogan why some people get sick and some don't.
[00:23:33.981 --> 00:23:36.922]  And I remember when that happened, I said, well, if Joe Rogan asked me, I could have told him.
[00:23:36.922 --> 00:23:38.663]  It was our reports were out, we already had scientists on.
[00:23:38.663 --> 00:23:45.845]  But Mercola is always so careful that he didn't go there and said, and said, I don't know.
[00:23:45.845 --> 00:23:47.786]  He said, I don't know.
[00:23:47.786 --> 00:23:49.266]  Because it hadn't been documented yet.
[00:23:49.266 --> 00:23:59.490]  But now, it's documented in all these studies that indeed, government worldwide, from New Zealand, Australia, to the Western Europe, to the UK, to the United States, all, only these countries,
[00:24:01.138 --> 00:24:03.319]  All under King Charles says he's going to depopulate us.
[00:24:03.319 --> 00:24:06.880]  He said he wants to come back, his dad wants to come back as a virus to kill 80% of us.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.581]  We're under their control and they're literally killing us.
[00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:16.383]  And they know exactly what they're doing and they have attacked us.
[00:24:16.383 --> 00:24:20.964]  And so understand, ladies and gentlemen, that this is ongoing.
[00:24:20.964 --> 00:24:22.245]  They're gearing up to do this again.
[00:24:22.245 --> 00:24:26.746]  And we have to take this extremely, extremely seriously.
[00:24:26.746 --> 00:24:28.867]  This happened and now Dr. Peter McCullough
[00:24:29.472 --> 00:24:35.076]  So to summarize, there are four domains of injury, cardiovascular, neurologic, thrombotic, and immunologic.
[00:24:35.076 --> 00:24:37.677]  The hardest question I've faced so far in all of my appearances in the media
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:59.365]  And I've probably given more media appearances now than any public figure in the world on COVID-19.
[00:24:59.365 --> 00:25:03.589]  The question came from Joe Rogan on his podcast in 2021.
[00:25:03.589 --> 00:25:15.479]  He said, Dr. McCullough, if these vaccines are so bad, why doesn't everybody have a side effect and are damaged after the vaccines?
[00:25:15.479 --> 00:25:17.962]  I didn't have the answer at that time, but I have it now.
[00:25:19.153 --> 00:25:30.922]  A paper by Schmeling and colleagues from Denmark has clearly shown that the batches of vaccines that come out, the lots groupings, are not the same.
[00:25:30.922 --> 00:25:36.067]  They had all the Pfizer data administered in Denmark and they had every side effect.
[00:25:36.067 --> 00:25:40.210]  They found three risk groups of batches.
[00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:46.435]  The first batch, which was about a third of people who got the vaccine, zero side effects, nothing whatsoever.
[00:25:47.776 --> 00:25:49.357]  It's like taking a shot of saline.
[00:25:49.357 --> 00:25:50.478]  Nothing.
[00:25:50.478 --> 00:25:59.183]  The second group, which is about two-thirds, had some moderate side effects, but the rate of serious side effects was pretty low.
[00:25:59.183 --> 00:26:02.144]  Then there's a third group, which is 4.2% of the vials.
[00:26:05.418 --> 00:26:05.638]  I think?
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:27.764]  Either the vials, these vials, and unfortunately these two ladies almost certainly received a bad batch.
[00:26:27.764 --> 00:26:34.027]  And these vials either have hyper-concentrated lipid nanoparticles and excessive amounts of messenger RNA.
[00:26:34.027 --> 00:26:42.472]  And in the United States, 94% of people who took a shot took messenger RNA, so we can stay on that technology.
[00:26:42.472 --> 00:26:47.435]  The other possibilities is that it could be contaminated with what's called cDNA or plasmids.
[00:26:48.357 --> 00:26:50.678]  Or other contaminants.
[00:26:50.678 --> 00:26:52.039]  It's certainly possible.
[00:26:52.039 --> 00:26:59.603]  I think hyperconcentration of messenger RNA is most likely, because what we're seeing are messenger RNA spike protein mediated injuries.
[00:26:59.603 --> 00:27:06.266]  But Senator Ron Johnson, just from the VAERS data, had sent analysis to the CDC on this, and the FDA.
[00:27:07.026 --> 00:27:14.749]  Asking for them to analyze the lot-to-lot variations that we're seeing, and he received a multi-page letter back that essentially says, we disagree.
[00:27:14.749 --> 00:27:16.770]  We don't see any difference in lot-to-lot.
[00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:24.994]  Now it's in the peer-reviewed publication forever in medical history showing it is a batch variability problem.
[00:27:24.994 --> 00:27:29.615]  Fortunately, most Americans received batch one or batch two.
[00:27:29.615 --> 00:27:30.256]  They're okay.
[00:27:30.996 --> 00:27:32.716]  Fortunately, they're fine.
[00:27:32.716 --> 00:27:37.097]  But for the small number of people who did receive a badge, we have big problems.
[00:27:37.097 --> 00:27:49.920]  A Zogby survey done last summer, a population-based sample, suggests 15% of Americans now have some injury, disability, or some medical problem they're dealing with due to COVID-19.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.980]  Let's stop right there.
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.401]  The full clip's being posted at InfoWars.com with a lot of show feet.
[00:27:54.401 --> 00:27:58.082]  I'm not going to out Dr. Peter McCullough, but we've hung out quite a bit and had dinner and stuff.
[00:27:58.983 --> 00:27:59.864]  He knows everything.
[00:27:59.864 --> 00:28:00.846]  He knows this is an intel op.
[00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:02.868]  He'll tell you the Pentagon did it on purpose.
[00:28:02.868 --> 00:28:06.893]  He's just being very careful here saying, oh, they might have contaminated it.
[00:28:06.893 --> 00:28:08.355]  No, it's the same all over the world.
[00:28:08.355 --> 00:28:09.577]  And again, it varies.
[00:28:09.577 --> 00:28:15.023]  In the U.S., it looks like they hit, like I said, 10% with the really deadly.
[00:28:15.023 --> 00:28:15.704]  And then it varies.
[00:28:15.704 --> 00:28:16.105]  It varies.
[00:28:16.818 --> 00:28:24.202]  Also, region to region, but that's why the report by Greg Rees is so important, because it links to the research groups that actually show what was happening in the U.S.
[00:28:24.202 --> 00:28:25.743]  over a year and a half ago.
[00:28:25.743 --> 00:28:29.105]  It's now been confirmed a very similar thing is going on in Denmark.
[00:28:29.105 --> 00:28:35.088]  But it looks like in the EU, they weren't hitting them as hard as they hit us in the U.S., because the EU is more controlled.
[00:28:35.088 --> 00:28:36.649]  But they still want to have some depth.
[00:28:36.649 --> 00:28:38.070]  They also want to say COVID's doing it.
[00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:43.093]  So they're setting the precedent to kill us, to cover it up, and to make money while they do it.
[00:28:43.093 --> 00:28:44.934]  These are the very globals that say they want to depopulate us.
[00:28:45.615 --> 00:28:47.276]  Well, of course they're killing us.
[00:28:47.276 --> 00:28:48.237]  They want the power to do it.
[00:28:48.237 --> 00:28:49.037]  It really happened.
[00:28:49.037 --> 00:28:49.818]  It's really happening.
[00:28:49.818 --> 00:28:52.980]  And now they're getting ready to release a new virus, but with new shots.
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:53.901]  They're murderers.
[00:28:53.901 --> 00:28:54.801]  They must be stopped.
[00:28:54.801 --> 00:28:55.382]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:55.382 --> 00:28:55.722]  Stay with us.
[00:28:59.184 --> 00:29:03.887]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.
[00:29:03.887 --> 00:29:05.868]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[00:29:05.868 --> 00:29:07.909]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:10.390]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:11.190]  Hey, what's better?
[00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:12.051]  Knockout?
[00:29:12.051 --> 00:29:13.391]  What's better?
[00:29:13.391 --> 00:29:14.132]  Down and out?
[00:29:14.132 --> 00:29:14.652]  What's better?
[00:29:14.652 --> 00:29:16.913]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:29:16.913 --> 00:29:21.856]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:26.514]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[00:29:26.514 --> 00:29:27.856]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:29:27.856 --> 00:29:29.157]  They're all very diverse.
[00:29:29.157 --> 00:29:39.350]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.

[00:30:59.028 --> 00:31:00.089]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[00:31:00.089 --> 00:31:01.171]  Do you like RainForce?
[00:31:01.171 --> 00:31:01.691]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:01.691 --> 00:31:03.714]  So, my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[00:31:03.714 --> 00:31:05.977]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:31:05.977 --> 00:31:12.265]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mykovitz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones?
[00:31:12.265 --> 00:31:15.329]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:19.630]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:23.592]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[00:31:23.592 --> 00:31:29.173]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[00:31:29.173 --> 00:31:36.856]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:31:36.856 --> 00:31:42.498]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[00:31:43.079 --> 00:31:43.701]  All right, we love you.
[00:31:43.701 --> 00:31:44.302]  We'll be right back.
[00:31:44.302 --> 00:31:49.378]  Get your BrainForce Plus, BrainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfowarStore.com.
[00:31:49.378 --> 00:31:50.441]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:31:59.011 --> 00:32:04.032]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[00:32:04.032 --> 00:32:06.193]  We made it even stronger.
[00:32:06.193 --> 00:32:09.934]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:32:09.934 --> 00:32:15.075]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:32:15.075 --> 00:32:22.917]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:32:22.917 --> 00:32:24.337]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:32:25.001 --> 00:32:38.088]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:32:38.088 --> 00:32:40.069]  It is the super fuel.
[00:32:40.069 --> 00:32:41.549]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:42.390]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:43.370]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:44.551]  They go good with this.
[00:32:44.551 --> 00:32:46.572]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:32:47.313 --> 00:32:48.794]  This is the Boss.
[00:32:48.794 --> 00:32:49.515]  TurboForce.
[00:32:49.515 --> 00:32:50.536]  Back in stock.
[00:32:50.536 --> 00:32:51.557]  Discounted.
[00:32:51.557 --> 00:32:53.278]  InfoWareStore.com.
[00:32:53.278 --> 00:32:54.139]  More power.
[00:32:54.139 --> 00:32:55.139]  More strength.
[00:32:55.139 --> 00:33:00.564]  More energy.
[00:33:00.564 --> 00:33:05.188]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:05.188 --> 00:33:06.469]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:23.012 --> 00:33:30.035]  So, if you look out your back door, let's just say you live in Knoxville, Tennessee.
[00:33:30.035 --> 00:33:32.777]  You live in a middle-class, nice neighborhood.
[00:33:32.777 --> 00:33:38.180]  You've got your little backyard, maybe a little pool or something.
[00:33:51.892 --> 00:33:57.475]  You look out your back window and your eight-year-old's out there swimming.
[00:33:57.475 --> 00:34:08.240]  You're watching him and you see a man come through your back gate and walk over and pour gasoline on your child with a gas can.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.621]  Now you're going to imagine he's about to pull a lighter out and set him on fire.
[00:34:10.621 --> 00:34:12.142]  This is psychotic.
[00:34:12.142 --> 00:34:18.705]  And so you're going to either have a gun right there or you're going to grab a butcher knife out of the butcher block where you're sitting there in the kitchen, maybe slicing up
[00:34:19.711 --> 00:34:20.431]  We're good to go.
[00:34:46.897 --> 00:34:54.881]  Ladies and gentlemen, the New World Order is pouring poison bioweapon all over our children and all over us and we just sit here and take it.
[00:34:54.881 --> 00:35:01.325]  And it's so scary that our government's been seized by psychotic depopulationists and transhumanists that we don't want to admit it.
[00:35:01.325 --> 00:35:03.746]  And we want to say Alex Jones is the bad guy.
[00:35:03.746 --> 00:35:09.810]  I've been told by high-level Justice Department whistleblowers off-air, I mean high-level, that they get the orders.
[00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:10.790]  You will indict Jones.
[00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:11.731]  You will find a case.
[00:35:11.731 --> 00:35:13.532]  It's been going on for at least seven, eight years.
[00:35:14.153 --> 00:35:20.698]  Because he destabilizes our country, and people listen to him, and we've tracked back almost the entire resistance to Jones.
[00:35:20.698 --> 00:35:22.539]  And I'm not bragging, that's what's going on.
[00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:23.580]  You can now see that.
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:27.262]  This audience, our guests, what we do here, not me.
[00:35:27.262 --> 00:35:29.204]  That's an important thing for my safety, and it's the truth.
[00:35:29.204 --> 00:35:34.908]  It's not me, it's this whole focal point, but this is God working through us, all of us together.
[00:35:34.908 --> 00:35:40.952]  Do those idiots think that that intimidates me, when I know that it's all coming out, that they knew these shots wouldn't protect you?
[00:35:42.364 --> 00:35:45.166]  It would destroy your immune system, it would kill a bunch of people.
[00:35:45.166 --> 00:35:50.330]  No, I have a responsibility to get these people off of our collective backs.
[00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:53.973]  Not because I'm a hero, but because I can face reality.
[00:35:53.973 --> 00:35:56.395]  And it's the same thing over and over again.
[00:35:56.395 --> 00:35:59.057]  Look at the craziness in our government.
[00:35:59.057 --> 00:35:59.938]  Now you see it in Congress.
[00:35:59.938 --> 00:36:08.925]  They admit that our Border Patrol and our military, in order to complete the smuggling process of children en masse, many of them end up dead, their organs harvested, or in sex slavery.
[00:36:08.925 --> 00:36:10.086]  I've got articles on that today.
[00:36:10.086 --> 00:36:10.426]  We're gonna hit.
[00:36:12.097 --> 00:36:18.581]  So, think about the country we live in, and the world we live in, where we don't stand up for each other.
[00:36:18.581 --> 00:36:26.527]  And where criminals, psychotic globalists, think they can get away with injecting us with bioweapons.
[00:36:26.527 --> 00:36:35.733]  But spreading it out where one person gets sick, one person feels fine, one person dies, and then just say, hey, the whole medical system went along with it.
[00:36:35.733 --> 00:36:38.495]  Everybody better get on board or we're all going to go down.
[00:36:38.495 --> 00:36:40.436]  See, they've gotten themselves a circle of the wagons.
[00:36:40.436 --> 00:36:41.737]  They got society
[00:36:42.788 --> 00:36:54.012]  The media, the PR firms, the bureaucrats, the censors, the big tech people, the medical people, to get on board with this, so they can do it on a bigger scale soon.
[00:36:54.012 --> 00:36:58.094]  And make no mistake, you will all pay for what you've done, not even by my hand.
[00:36:58.094 --> 00:37:02.676]  The Globalists plan to get rid of at least 90% of people.
[00:37:02.676 --> 00:37:10.899]  So you'll hear me go through different numbers, where I'll say, oh, Prince Charles wants to kill 80%, his dad wants 80%, but the internal documents say 90%.
[00:37:12.643 --> 00:37:27.771]  It all varies, but when you get their public documents, they say 80 or 90 percent, because the minions believe they're going to be the guardians, the ones carrying out the slow extermination, where we don't notice it, but in the aggregate it accelerates, with the ambient heat being turned up, the frog in the pod.
[00:37:27.771 --> 00:37:32.753]  They have to think, they have to have their minions believing that they're going to be protected in this, though they're not.
[00:37:32.753 --> 00:37:40.457]  And a lot of the minions out there understand, it's like, wow, they still hit us with, you know, 10 percent of us are, you know, in the case of Europe, 4 percent of us in liberal areas,
[00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.451]  They still hit us with this, and now 15% of us are sick.
[00:37:44.451 --> 00:37:45.991]  That's the left.
[00:37:45.991 --> 00:37:48.152]  In conservative areas, it's even higher.
[00:37:48.152 --> 00:37:49.353]  It's 30.
[00:37:49.353 --> 00:37:55.055]  And this is just the beginning to see if they can get away with this.
[00:37:55.055 --> 00:37:56.495]  Do you really think that's cool?
[00:37:56.495 --> 00:37:57.855]  And you're like, well, yeah, there are too many people.
[00:37:57.855 --> 00:37:58.716]  We've got to kill folks.
[00:37:58.716 --> 00:38:00.096]  So what you are is you're really evil.
[00:38:00.096 --> 00:38:01.097]  You like it.
[00:38:01.097 --> 00:38:03.537]  So let's understand.
[00:38:03.537 --> 00:38:04.698]  The left does like this.
[00:38:04.698 --> 00:38:06.398]  The average leftist knows what's going on now.
[00:38:06.398 --> 00:38:07.199]  They've been educated.
[00:38:07.199 --> 00:38:07.879]  They know, and they like it.
[00:38:08.843 --> 00:38:18.845]  They like abortion, they like infanticide, they like sterilization, they like GMO, they like soy, they like 5G, they like coffin apartments, they like eating bugs, they like evil.
[00:38:18.845 --> 00:38:26.047]  Now, there are a lot of big famous liberals going public and saying, I should never have taken the shot, it's evil, it's bad, it hurt my friends and family.
[00:38:26.047 --> 00:38:26.767]  We were lied to.
[00:38:26.767 --> 00:38:28.487]  Elon Musk's brother almost died.
[00:38:28.487 --> 00:38:30.547]  Elon Musk got sick.
[00:38:30.547 --> 00:38:35.548]  Elon Musk has one of his kids taken away and they're going to cut the penis off.
[00:38:35.548 --> 00:38:36.829]  You know, that's what's happened.
[00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:37.889]  That'll get you away here.
[00:38:38.618 --> 00:38:42.139]  Because not even Elon Musk's kids are safe from this.
[00:38:42.139 --> 00:38:47.401]  So folks, there's going to be a time we're going to decide to stand, because you're going to have your survival instinct kick in at some point.
[00:38:47.401 --> 00:38:56.664]  The enemy just hopes to have us so poisoned and so dumbed down and so isolated and so cut off resource-wise that by the time you figure it out, it's too late.
[00:38:56.664 --> 00:38:58.064]  Well, guess what?
[00:38:58.064 --> 00:39:00.125]  It's not too late now.
[00:39:00.125 --> 00:39:04.146]  And so I instinctively, on a spiritual level, have to fight this.
[00:39:04.146 --> 00:39:06.026]  And I know I'm right.
[00:39:06.026 --> 00:39:07.667]  And I know it's worse than I can even tell you.
[00:39:09.384 --> 00:39:14.447]  I know Fauci went from being worth $100 million to $200 million during the pandemic.
[00:39:14.447 --> 00:39:17.209]  I know Hotez went from being worth $10 million to $35 million.
[00:39:17.209 --> 00:39:18.650]  That's the money we know of.
[00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:23.273]  And think of the chicken feed they got paid by their bosses that made hundreds of billions.
[00:39:23.273 --> 00:39:26.796]  Pfizer made over $100 billion on their poison shot.
[00:39:26.796 --> 00:39:29.117]  And liability protection and all the rest of it.
[00:39:29.117 --> 00:39:30.478]  It's not about that, folks.
[00:39:30.478 --> 00:39:33.700]  The money is just how they get their minions to go along.
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:38.944]  No, there's the groups up above it that are doing this that literally want to destroy our DNA, destroy our fertility,
[00:39:39.665 --> 00:39:45.189]  And that's what these shots really do to the majority of people that take them.
[00:39:45.189 --> 00:39:49.151]  It's not a side effect, though, that also kills you.
[00:39:49.151 --> 00:39:54.354]  It is a poisonous program against your body that grows protein crystals.
[00:39:54.354 --> 00:39:59.698]  Here's Fauci doubling his net worth during the pandemic.
[00:39:59.698 --> 00:40:00.919]  It was not a pandemic.
[00:40:00.919 --> 00:40:03.320]  It's the shots that caused the mass death.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:03.900]  Here's another one.
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:04.601]  Then we'll go to these clips.
[00:40:07.037 --> 00:40:12.219]  Klaus Schwab praises CCP for its COVID control measures, says we need those here.
[00:40:12.219 --> 00:40:13.559]  See?
[00:40:13.559 --> 00:40:16.580]  At the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Clinton Foundation, all of it.
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.181]  What do they say?
[00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:27.464]  They say, well this showed us the public doesn't trust us, and people don't believe in medicine and science anymore, you mean you hijacking it, and weaponizing it.
[00:40:27.464 --> 00:40:35.227]  Weaponizing medical information to terrorize the public, to scare them into submission, to take more shots, and use Pentagon mind control programs on the public.
[00:40:35.828 --> 00:40:39.532]  Every major ministry of defense doing the same thing.
[00:40:39.532 --> 00:40:41.154]  Chelsea Clinton saying nobody believes us anymore.
[00:40:41.154 --> 00:40:42.275]  Yeah, we don't believe you anymore.
[00:40:42.275 --> 00:40:44.117]  So her answer is we're going to double down.
[00:40:44.117 --> 00:40:45.418]  We're going to get more aggressive.
[00:40:45.418 --> 00:40:46.699]  We're going to lock you down harder.
[00:40:46.699 --> 00:40:47.680]  That'll make you submit.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:48.561]  That'll break your will.
[00:40:48.561 --> 00:40:55.548]  So when we come back, I'm going to play two Klaus Schwab clips back to back.
[00:40:55.548 --> 00:40:57.050]  One of the classics, and there's a new one.
[00:40:58.211 --> 00:41:03.272]  It's just COVID is going to cause a breakdown of civilization and food and water and transportation.
[00:41:03.272 --> 00:41:07.593]  But it's not COVID, it's their lockdown that did it and the poison shots.
[00:41:07.593 --> 00:41:13.174]  Now with 15% of the Western population sick and dying from the shots.
[00:41:13.174 --> 00:41:21.395]  In Vietnam, they love to wound somebody because they found that wounding an enemy soldier would take up more resources than actually killing an enemy soldier.
[00:41:21.395 --> 00:41:22.576]  So they created the 556 or 223.
[00:41:26.266 --> 00:41:31.368]  High velocity, but tends to wound, not kill as often, but shatter bones.
[00:41:31.368 --> 00:41:34.869]  The bullet disintegrates in the body, and that's why they deployed it.
[00:41:34.869 --> 00:41:38.470]  It'll also hold a lot of the cartridges, carry them easier.
[00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:41.751]  It is an amazing round, but that's what's going on here.
[00:41:41.751 --> 00:41:44.612]  Klaus Schwab praises CCP for its COVID control measures.
[00:41:44.612 --> 00:41:45.252]  We're gonna cover that.
[00:41:46.557 --> 00:41:49.140]  When we return and then how it ties and everything else.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.361]  Oh, and this.
[00:41:50.361 --> 00:41:53.424]  Netherlands euthanizing autistic and intellectually handicapped people.
[00:41:53.424 --> 00:41:55.066]  Research finds show us Canada.
[00:41:55.066 --> 00:41:58.229]  It's the same unified program worldwide.
[00:41:58.229 --> 00:41:59.009]  Here we go again.
[00:41:59.009 --> 00:42:03.694]  Former CIA agent to run censorship at Facebook and Meta.
[00:42:03.694 --> 00:42:09.099]  We have video of this charity worker caught trying to sell a baby, a one-year-old baby to organ harvesters for $25,000 in Ukraine.
[00:42:13.445 --> 00:42:15.166]  So much more coming up.
[00:42:15.166 --> 00:42:21.187]  California set to sign a law that kidnaps children from people that won't let the state cut their penises and breasts off.
[00:42:21.187 --> 00:42:22.147]  It's all coming up.
[00:42:22.147 --> 00:42:25.708]  Don't forget InfoWars.com and ZipTheSpearBand.video.
[00:42:25.708 --> 00:42:28.989]  But those URLs are hard to share sometimes, and they're blocked, so you have to do it by word of mouth.
[00:42:28.989 --> 00:42:30.610]  So share Mad Max World.
[00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:31.150]  One word.
[00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.950]  Mad Max World.
[00:42:32.529 --> 00:42:35.371]  All right, we'll go to break, and we will return on the other side.
[00:42:35.371 --> 00:42:36.031]  So much more to cover.
[00:42:36.031 --> 00:42:37.252]  I hope the phone's up today as well.
[00:42:37.252 --> 00:42:39.934]  InfoWars.com is tomorrow's news today, but the only way the dog hunts is you release it.
[00:42:39.934 --> 00:42:40.574]  You are the resistance.
[00:43:00.882 --> 00:43:07.347]  Two of our best-selling nootropics, or brain boosters, are now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:43:07.347 --> 00:43:12.251]  For a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together, or 40% off when you get them individually.
[00:43:12.251 --> 00:43:14.913]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra.
[00:43:14.913 --> 00:43:16.635]  Two separate formulas.
[00:43:16.635 --> 00:43:18.957]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[00:43:19.577 --> 00:43:25.182]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy, again with no hangover or letdown.
[00:43:25.182 --> 00:43:30.766]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula, that's Brain Force Ultra, that hits really, really quick.
[00:43:30.766 --> 00:43:31.226]  And I love it.
[00:43:31.226 --> 00:43:32.708]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[00:43:32.708 --> 00:43:37.051]  So if I've got to work at night, but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and stay nine o'clock at night.
[00:43:37.051 --> 00:43:40.074]  I stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview or something, and boom!
[00:43:41.175 --> 00:43:41.355]  Thank you.
[00:43:58.815 --> 00:44:07.203]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth, and they've got our children drinking that.
[00:44:07.203 --> 00:44:09.825]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[00:44:09.825 --> 00:44:10.566]  Period.
[00:44:10.566 --> 00:44:11.667]  Case closed.
[00:44:11.667 --> 00:44:13.048]  Out to get you and your family.
[00:44:13.048 --> 00:44:14.309]  We shall, the Alexa
[00:44:14.469 --> 00:44:14.970]  We're good to go.
[00:44:29.685 --> 00:44:34.046]  In all the studies, it reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[00:44:34.046 --> 00:44:35.586]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[00:44:35.586 --> 00:44:38.387]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:44:38.387 --> 00:44:43.628]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[00:44:43.628 --> 00:44:49.089]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:44:49.089 --> 00:44:50.729]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:44:50.729 --> 00:44:52.310]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:53.870]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:56.431]  The point is, you can get the filters at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:44:56.431 --> 00:44:57.631]  They're discounted right now.
[00:44:57.631 --> 00:44:58.351]  Finally back in stock.
[00:44:58.971 --> 00:45:04.976]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[00:45:04.976 --> 00:45:07.617]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[00:45:07.617 --> 00:45:09.819]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:45:09.819 --> 00:45:12.401]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[00:45:12.401 --> 00:45:15.623]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:45:15.623 --> 00:45:17.385]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[00:45:17.385 --> 00:45:24.010]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:26.792]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:45:27.762 --> 00:45:29.883]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:45:29.883 --> 00:45:34.507]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[00:45:34.507 --> 00:45:38.229]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:45:38.229 --> 00:45:41.371]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage your listeners to understand.
[00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:43.933]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[00:45:43.933 --> 00:45:45.294]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:45:45.294 --> 00:45:51.058]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products at the same time at InfoWars.com.
[00:45:51.058 --> 00:45:52.438]  So don't procrastinate.
[00:45:52.438 --> 00:45:53.759]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:45:53.759 --> 00:45:57.702]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[00:45:58.683 --> 00:46:03.125]  In the short time we have, I can't get into all the incredible ingredients in Super Female Vitality.
[00:46:03.125 --> 00:46:11.970]  Go to mfullmorestore.com, read about the ingredients, look them up for yourself, and then understand this is cold pressed herbs, so it has a more powerful effect on the body.
[00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:14.431]  Get yours today at mfullmorestore.com for 50% off.
[00:46:16.934 --> 00:46:18.955]  Super Mel Vitality is selling out.
[00:46:18.955 --> 00:46:21.796]  It's an incredible formula for stamina, energy, libido.
[00:46:21.796 --> 00:46:23.136]  Only a few hundred bottles left.
[00:46:23.136 --> 00:46:28.518]  But the good news is we have several thousand bottles left of Super Female Vitality that's the same formula.
[00:46:28.518 --> 00:46:29.298]  It boosts men.
[00:46:29.298 --> 00:46:30.318]  It boosts women.
[00:46:30.318 --> 00:46:31.079]  It works great.
[00:46:31.079 --> 00:46:32.959]  But women like pink labels.
[00:46:32.959 --> 00:46:34.920]  Men like different color labels.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.940]  So it works for men as well.
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.021]  It's the same formula.
[00:46:38.021 --> 00:46:39.281]  It's an incredible formula.
[00:46:39.281 --> 00:46:40.221]  And it funds our operation.
[00:46:40.221 --> 00:46:41.922]  And there's another important part of the
[00:46:42.282 --> 00:46:43.583]  Overall information.
[00:46:43.583 --> 00:46:46.184]  It's 50% off for a limited time.
[00:46:46.184 --> 00:46:53.447]  So get your Super Female Vitality for men and women at InfoWarStore.com right now for 50% off and it funds the InfoWar.
[00:46:53.447 --> 00:47:01.251]  Super Female Vitality, 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:47:01.251 --> 00:47:07.154]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:26.964]  Alright, I've got a ton of news on the economy, on war, on the New World Order, on the poison shots.
[00:47:26.964 --> 00:47:31.747]  Just insane stuff coming up next hour interspersed with your phone calls.
[00:47:31.747 --> 00:47:35.709]  I'm going to open the phones up here at the end of the segment in a moment.
[00:47:35.709 --> 00:47:37.349]  But let me get back to Klaus Schwab.
[00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:38.530]  You've got to read his books.
[00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:41.031]  You've got to watch him at his World Government Summits they have.
[00:47:41.031 --> 00:47:42.132]  They're called World Government Summits.
[00:47:42.771 --> 00:47:50.033]  You've got to read and listen to this because, I mean, it's all, you're obsolete, we're getting rid of you, you will eat bugs, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing.
[00:47:50.033 --> 00:48:01.095]  It's everything we told you decades ago because we were getting the documents and the research and the whistleblowers from the Club of Rome, from the Bilderberg Group, from the Trilateral Commission.
[00:48:01.095 --> 00:48:04.576]  But we're not covering what they were doing in the dark now.
[00:48:04.576 --> 00:48:06.937]  They've launched the attack, folks.
[00:48:06.937 --> 00:48:07.377]  Again, like,
[00:48:08.248 --> 00:48:09.228]  The British and the U.S.
[00:48:09.228 --> 00:48:11.149]  knew that the Japanese were going to attack Pearl Harbor.
[00:48:11.149 --> 00:48:15.829]  They weren't sure exactly when, but they knew it was going to be in that week.
[00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:19.210]  They sent half the troops away and sailors away on leave.
[00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:20.770]  Basically stood down and let them attack.
[00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:24.551]  Had the aircraft carriers out to sea, though, because they knew that was going to be key in the real fight.
[00:48:24.551 --> 00:48:27.511]  Really cold-blooded, and they didn't stage the attack.
[00:48:27.511 --> 00:48:28.592]  They just let it happen.
[00:48:28.592 --> 00:48:29.972]  That's been partially declassified.
[00:48:29.972 --> 00:48:36.653]  I interviewed the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Moore, before he died, and he said it was well known in the Navy that it was allowed to happen.
[00:48:38.364 --> 00:48:40.525]  This is beyond that.
[00:48:40.525 --> 00:48:47.346]  And so they are actually creating the crises to bring in the total control.
[00:48:47.346 --> 00:48:51.347]  And this is a very dystopic system they're setting up.
[00:48:51.347 --> 00:48:55.108]  And they sell their minions that are in on most of the plan at the highest levels.
[00:48:55.108 --> 00:49:00.650]  Mid-level really aren't, though they figured it out now and a lot of them are joining it out of pure fear.
[00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:04.150]  But others do it because they are just associated to power.
[00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:05.971]  And they think, well, I'll be safer working with this.
[00:49:06.696 --> 00:49:09.757]  Which, in my research and study, you will not be.
[00:49:09.757 --> 00:49:11.418]  Plus, it's the wrong thing to do.
[00:49:11.418 --> 00:49:12.658]  Have we all gotten a little lazy?
[00:49:12.658 --> 00:49:14.339]  Is modern society decadent for a lot of people?
[00:49:14.339 --> 00:49:15.519]  Yeah.
[00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:17.060]  But go be part of charity.
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:17.520]  Garden.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.440]  Go to church.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.481]  Help people.
[00:49:20.481 --> 00:49:31.285]  And understand the most rich and most decadent people are proud of their decadence and just want to kill the most of the public so they can have the earth themselves.
[00:49:31.285 --> 00:49:33.025]  Well, it's not your earth.
[00:49:33.025 --> 00:49:34.906]  And I'm not just going to sit here and let you have it.
[00:49:35.569 --> 00:49:37.670]  And let you run over everybody.
[00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:40.032]  They're a bunch of selfish pedophiles.
[00:49:40.032 --> 00:49:42.313]  And it runs from, that's bad to worse.
[00:49:42.313 --> 00:49:44.294]  I mean, they get way worse than just pedophilia.
[00:49:44.294 --> 00:49:46.015]  They kill the kids, a lot of them.
[00:49:46.015 --> 00:49:52.159]  Because it's all about their selfishness and about embodying that and embodying that as a ritual.
[00:49:52.159 --> 00:49:54.600]  And that's what these poison shots are.
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.961]  So, Klaus Schwab means business.
[00:49:56.961 --> 00:50:01.244]  Klaus Schwab praises CCP for its COVID control measures.
[00:50:03.191 --> 00:50:05.232]  But before we play this clip, we'll play it back to back.
[00:50:05.232 --> 00:50:07.432]  Here he is again.
[00:50:07.432 --> 00:50:21.577]  Two years ago, two and a half years ago, when it all was really in the middle of the COVID, he had a lot of speeches on this saying, we're going to use this to bring in control and to get the new carbon reset and to get people used to being locked down, this time for carbon lockdowns.
[00:50:21.577 --> 00:50:28.019]  And even if we don't officially have carbon lockdowns, we'll just cut off the energy until people can't move or travel or be prosperous.
[00:50:28.019 --> 00:50:31.581]  And then to the third world, that means death, cutting off the carbon.
[00:50:31.581 --> 00:50:32.621]  Those machines eat carbon.
[00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:37.072]  We put off carbon, and when they talk about banning carbon, they're talking about banning you.
[00:50:37.072 --> 00:50:46.137]  That's why, in my film Endgame, I tell you that they're going to ban fireplaces, charcoal, grills, and space heaters.
[00:50:46.137 --> 00:50:52.640]  That was officially in the EU-UN policy in 2009, when I made The Obama Deception.
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.842]  Two and a half hour film, go watch it, it's free online.
[00:50:54.842 --> 00:50:57.143]  The Obama Deception.
[00:50:57.143 --> 00:50:58.844]  The Obama Deception, it's at Man.Video.
[00:50:58.844 --> 00:50:59.704]  Watch it.
[00:50:59.704 --> 00:51:01.905]  It's better today than when I made it in 2009, 14 years ago.
[00:51:04.412 --> 00:51:08.693]  And it says they will bring in charcoal pizza ovens.
[00:51:08.693 --> 00:51:10.774]  I specifically say that.
[00:51:10.774 --> 00:51:12.034]  And because they said it.
[00:51:12.034 --> 00:51:12.554]  And now it's here.
[00:51:12.554 --> 00:51:15.335]  You're like, well, that's just the idiots in New York.
[00:51:15.335 --> 00:51:16.816]  I love this weird thing people do.
[00:51:16.816 --> 00:51:18.696]  Like, I don't care if a stock market crashes.
[00:51:18.696 --> 00:51:19.777]  I'm not in the stock market.
[00:51:19.777 --> 00:51:21.377]  Everything's tied to the stock market.
[00:51:21.377 --> 00:51:21.857]  I don't care.
[00:51:21.857 --> 00:51:25.218]  I don't live in Houston, Shreveport.
[00:51:25.218 --> 00:51:33.901]  I don't care if they shut off the Keystone Pipeline that costs $35 million to build and would create hundreds of millions of barrels every few days of oil or gasoline.
[00:51:35.652 --> 00:51:37.172]  That affects what you pay for gas.
[00:51:37.172 --> 00:51:39.173]  It's just this, it's crazy.
[00:51:39.173 --> 00:51:45.875]  So when I see San Francisco falling apart, or New York, I don't go, oh, screw them in New York, or screw them in Los Angeles.
[00:51:45.875 --> 00:51:47.696]  You're gonna be next.
[00:51:47.696 --> 00:51:50.176]  And there's this attitude in Texas, and I love Texas.
[00:51:50.176 --> 00:51:51.937]  My family's been here on both sides since the founding of it.
[00:51:51.937 --> 00:51:53.637]  I'm about as Texas as you can get.
[00:51:53.637 --> 00:51:57.698]  And I got a shotgun arrival, a four-wheel drive, and I got cows, and I know how to do everything.
[00:51:57.698 --> 00:52:01.640]  I know how to give them everything they need, including a bunch of their ass.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:02.640]  But the point is, is that
[00:52:03.996 --> 00:52:05.758]  The average Texan's like, don't ever get us!
[00:52:05.758 --> 00:52:08.241]  Texas is that close to going down.
[00:52:08.241 --> 00:52:12.466]  Florida discovered it was going down and fought back and has gained a little ground.
[00:52:12.466 --> 00:52:16.711]  In a football game at halftime, they're only a field goal ahead.
[00:52:16.711 --> 00:52:18.353]  Texas is behind.
[00:52:18.353 --> 00:52:20.696]  But I'm ranting.
[00:52:20.696 --> 00:52:21.437]  You know, I'll do this.
[00:52:21.437 --> 00:52:23.560]  I'm going to start the next hour and play these classic Bob Clips.
[00:52:24.992 --> 00:52:29.015]  And then I'm going to open the phones up, take your calls and all the rest of it.
[00:52:29.015 --> 00:52:39.842]  But it's just incredible that they're just killing us with these poison shots, sending out lots to conservative and Christian areas, areas they don't control to kill higher numbers of people, but still killing some of theirs, so it's not as easy to notice.
[00:52:39.842 --> 00:52:42.544]  I mean, that is so incredible.
[00:52:42.544 --> 00:52:43.745]  What are we going to do about that?
[00:52:44.355 --> 00:52:58.702]  Now, I want to play a two and a half minute clip from Sunday night with this incredible lady, Octavia Wilder, who has worked for some of the biggest names out there, but decided to leave the whole Hollywood system and be part of the River Church there in Tampa.
[00:52:58.702 --> 00:53:02.664]  She's a top, top vocalist, operatic singer.
[00:53:02.664 --> 00:53:04.906]  I mean, I've never seen anything like it in person.
[00:53:04.906 --> 00:53:08.628]  And I want to go out and start to sing Bengal Branner in the shower.
[00:53:08.628 --> 00:53:11.909]  And then I've got some other amazing singers like Raymond Silleris.
[00:53:11.909 --> 00:53:13.170]  We're going to be playing some of that.
[00:53:14.341 --> 00:53:18.965]  Coming up as well, he does the proud to be American and more because these were just so powerful.
[00:53:18.965 --> 00:53:20.886]  I have to sit right there feet away and hear it.
[00:53:20.886 --> 00:53:22.448]  That's coming up.
[00:53:22.448 --> 00:53:26.130]  But before we end this segment, I want to thank Delicious for support.
[00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:30.594]  If you bought as much product as you bought yesterday, every day, we wouldn't just stay on air.
[00:53:30.594 --> 00:53:35.398]  We'd be able to hire 10 reporters or anchors and just do things that are incredible and change the world even better.
[00:53:36.728 --> 00:53:47.832]  So, if you'll just make purchases for a couple weeks at the level you did yesterday, we will be out of the $500,000 hole we're in, and then we've got a new product coming in, some other stuff I believe will be stabilized soon.
[00:53:47.832 --> 00:53:50.273]  Plus, you need these products, they're really great.
[00:53:50.273 --> 00:53:54.775]  We have the 4th of July Super Sale going right now through the 4th of July, and then it'll have to end.
[00:53:54.775 --> 00:54:02.238]  And Nitric Boost is discounted, so good for your blood, so good to purify things, so good to go after all the spikes and all the chemicals and all the things that are in our environment.
[00:54:03.163 --> 00:54:05.425]  That's what Dr. Mikovits and others say everybody should be taking.
[00:54:05.425 --> 00:54:08.848]  Specifically, without me asking, he said it's an incredible formula, one of the best he's seen.
[00:54:08.848 --> 00:54:10.289]  There's other ones out there that do the same thing.
[00:54:10.289 --> 00:54:11.550]  Just whatever you do, get them.
[00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:13.612]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:54:13.612 --> 00:54:15.653]  That is the nitric boost.
[00:54:15.653 --> 00:54:20.777]  And then we also have the krill oil, the fish oil, that are comparable.
[00:54:20.777 --> 00:54:22.058]  And that's not the word I'm looking for.
[00:54:22.058 --> 00:54:24.260]  They're not even comparable.
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.201]  They help it.
[00:54:25.201 --> 00:54:27.183]  That's the word I'm looking for.
[00:54:27.183 --> 00:54:28.063]  They complement it.
[00:54:28.063 --> 00:54:28.664]  That's it.
[00:54:28.664 --> 00:54:29.905]  It boosts the boost.
[00:54:30.464 --> 00:54:32.144]  They'll do the same thing, but they boost the boost.
[00:54:32.144 --> 00:54:33.305]  Krill oil, the highest quality.
[00:54:33.305 --> 00:54:35.605]  Fish oil, highest quality.

[00:54:47.068 --> 00:54:48.369]  Supermales sold out.

[00:54:50.129 --> 00:54:51.729]  It just has a pink label.
[00:54:51.729 --> 00:54:53.850]  And it does amazing things for stamina and libido energy.
[00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:54.750]  It's 60% off.

[00:54:58.058 --> 00:55:01.501]  This is the time for you to try it, to experience it, to get it.
[00:55:01.501 --> 00:55:03.463]  It'll sell out quick, too, but I just want you to have it.

[00:55:16.354 --> 00:55:17.135]  We'll be back next hour.
[00:55:31.713 --> 00:55:54.842]  Lucy, can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
[00:55:57.762 --> 00:56:16.845]  Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
[00:56:16.845 --> 00:56:20.826]  And the rocket's red glare,
[00:56:31.945 --> 00:56:32.467]  Yeah.
[00:57:36.858 --> 00:57:41.068]  Live from Tampa, The River Church, Rodney Howard Brown!
[00:57:41.068 --> 00:57:41.549]  Amazing!
[00:57:49.093 --> 00:57:57.976]  Two amazing nootropics, that means brain power, are back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com, and they're both 50% off.
[00:57:57.976 --> 00:58:02.218]  We haven't offered these for 50% off since last Christmas.
[00:58:02.218 --> 00:58:06.220]  These are amazing products, and for those of you on the fence, I want you to try them.
[00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:09.201]  Brain Force Ultra hits in 15 minutes, only lasts 3 hours.
[00:58:09.901 --> 00:58:10.261]  We're good
[00:58:31.684 --> 00:58:31.884]  We're good.
[00:58:49.033 --> 00:58:54.036]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[00:58:54.036 --> 00:58:56.598]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[00:58:56.598 --> 00:58:58.099]  So let me get this straight.
[00:58:58.099 --> 00:59:17.531]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the Obama administration, Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son, Hunter, to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption, an event that Donald Trump looked into, sparking the first impeachment, enforcing the arming of Ukraine, in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia,
[00:59:17.831 --> 00:59:44.140]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had, but that they swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign, all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents, despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016, when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:45.340]  Do I have that all straight?
[00:59:52.577 --> 01:00:06.792]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:06.792 --> 01:00:13.478]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:00:13.478 --> 01:00:13.999]  You better fight!
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:30.987]  After seven years of violent revolution, our American founders were well aware that political factions were most often used to divide and conquer the people.
[01:00:30.987 --> 01:00:38.392]  And they knew that the republic they created would only last as long as the people could remain educated.
[01:00:38.392 --> 01:00:48.379]  In 1816, Thomas Jefferson wrote, if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.
[01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:54.374]  By the end of the Civil War, the two-party system became the norm.
[01:00:54.374 --> 01:00:58.196]  The globalist system we face today was born.
[01:00:58.196 --> 01:01:03.920]  And the deliberate dumbing down of the American citizen began with our great-great-grandparents.
[01:01:05.339 --> 01:01:12.964]  In the late 1800s, the Skinner-Pavlovian method was brought into American schools by Johns Hopkins.
[01:01:12.964 --> 01:01:21.991]  These psychological methods allowed teachers the ability to program students' behavior in the same way that Pavlov did with dogs.
[01:01:23.071 --> 01:01:40.496]  In 1934, the Carnegie International Endowment for Peace published the Report on the Commission on Social Studies, which explicitly stated the goal of eventually taking away people's land, and noted that most people would obviously oppose this.
[01:01:40.496 --> 01:01:45.878]  The solution was to begin using the school system to recondition the minds of children.
[01:01:47.098 --> 01:02:03.503]  In 1976, the bicentennial year of the Declaration of Independence, 124 congressmen signed the Declaration of Interdependence, which stated that two centuries ago, our forefathers brought forth a new nation.
[01:02:03.503 --> 01:02:07.605]  Now we must join with others to bring forth a new world order.
[01:02:08.866 --> 01:02:16.534]  And it pledged to give children special attention in distributing a common education to suit their goals.
[01:02:16.534 --> 01:02:28.366]  By the 1990s, this globalist, dumbing-down system was perfected, and America began exporting it worldwide in what is known as outcome-based education.
[01:02:29.587 --> 01:02:34.972]  Starting in 2010, Common Core began in the United States.
[01:02:34.972 --> 01:02:43.778]  It outlined what students were expected to know at each grade level and enforced ways to assess those standards.
[01:02:43.778 --> 01:02:48.042]  Charlotte Isserby, author of The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America,
[01:02:48.502 --> 01:03:07.322]  ...has traced most of this agenda stemming from the Order of Skull and Bones at Yale, through both Republicans and Democrats, two wings of the same globalist bird, which understood that dumbed-down people have a base desire for a simple dualistic choice.
[01:03:08.986 --> 01:03:24.404]  In 1953, the Rockefeller Foundation funded the Robber's Cave Experiment, wherein 11-year-old boys, who thought they were signing up for summer camp, were organized into two separate tribes and were manipulated into fighting each other.
[01:03:24.924 --> 01:03:31.089]  Which was easily accomplished by having a single resource that the two groups competed for.
[01:03:31.089 --> 01:03:42.617]  The Henry Toshville experiments of the 1970s showed that by simply dividing people into two groups, they would naturally identify with their own group and discriminate against the other.
[01:03:43.617 --> 01:03:47.898]  The basic ego mind is constantly making preferences.
[01:03:47.898 --> 01:03:52.320]  No matter how dumb you are, you have an opinion about everything.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:04:01.062]  And if you can keep the population dumb enough and give them two parties to choose from, they will innately identify with one and despise the other.
[01:04:01.762 --> 01:04:14.945]  This allows the globalist system the cover they need to implement unpopular policies, such as a central bank digital currency, while we the people ignorantly fight each other.
[01:04:14.945 --> 01:04:21.826]  United we stand, divided we fall, and we've been falling for it for generations.
[01:04:21.826 --> 01:04:30.888]  The American people have been so thoroughly dumbed down that we think freedom is the ability to choose between two parties working for the same control system.
[01:04:31.708 --> 01:04:41.096]  And we have been made so weak that we are afraid to even discuss the option of violence, which is most often the only remedy for tyranny.
[01:04:41.096 --> 01:04:49.443]  But if we were an enlightened people, we could simply unite together as one and just say no to the tyrants.
[01:04:49.443 --> 01:04:50.624]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:04:50.624 --> 01:04:52.606]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:04:59.693 --> 01:05:02.556]  InfoWars is a one-of-a-kind operation.
[01:05:02.556 --> 01:05:06.060]  And so, please, go to InfoWars store and just make a donation.
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:07.682]  And you can make it one time or recurring.
[01:05:07.682 --> 01:05:11.106]  You have a little profile there, cancelling time.
[01:05:11.106 --> 01:05:15.451]  Every 15 days, every month, every 3 months, every 6 months, up to 9 months.
[01:05:16.425 --> 01:05:20.247]  You can go in and every month or every week, whenever you want, you program it.
[01:05:20.247 --> 01:05:23.208]  You just click it and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[01:05:23.208 --> 01:05:24.288]  So please do that as well.
[01:05:24.288 --> 01:05:29.550]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees instead of making 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:31.131]  But these really are amazing products.
[01:05:31.131 --> 01:05:32.852]  The big July 4th sale is going on right now.
[01:05:32.852 --> 01:05:35.833]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:05:35.833 --> 01:05:37.833]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:39.214]  People are listening more than ever.
[01:05:39.214 --> 01:05:41.335]  But in this major recession going into depression,
[01:05:41.915 --> 01:05:44.318]  And with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[01:05:44.318 --> 01:05:45.259]  I know times are tough.
[01:05:45.259 --> 01:05:46.921]  So thank you for your support.
[01:05:46.921 --> 01:05:50.506]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[01:05:50.506 --> 01:05:51.807]  That you can do for free.
[01:05:51.807 --> 01:05:53.990]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:57.214]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[01:05:57.214 --> 01:05:58.896]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[01:05:58.896 --> 01:05:59.357]  God bless you.
[01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:15.160]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:20.842]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.842 --> 01:06:22.842]  Alright, in this hour, into the next.
[01:06:22.842 --> 01:06:28.323]  I want to open the phones up and talk to the listeners and get your take on all the news we've covered.
[01:06:28.323 --> 01:06:30.964]  So it's going to be first-time callers, long-time callers.
[01:06:30.964 --> 01:06:32.004]  We're not screening your calls.
[01:06:32.004 --> 01:06:33.965]  Just have a clean phone line.
[01:06:33.965 --> 01:06:34.585]  Make your point.
[01:06:34.585 --> 01:06:35.845]  We'll move the next person that way.
[01:06:35.845 --> 01:06:38.026]  We get to hear the great things you have to say.
[01:06:38.026 --> 01:06:39.766]  Informative, the interesting, the ridiculous.
[01:06:40.561 --> 01:06:43.924]  Thought-provoking, and we get to move the next person to hear them.
[01:06:43.924 --> 01:06:58.195]  But I ask you to at least comment on government studies out of the EU confirming that they were giving most people placebo, others a mild dose of the death shot, and others a strong injection.
[01:06:58.195 --> 01:06:58.856]  Many of them died.
[01:06:58.856 --> 01:07:03.439]  I mean, I can't believe I'm just calmly talking about this.
[01:07:03.439 --> 01:07:04.540]  We've known this for years.
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.542]  I played a Gregory's Report from 17, 18, no, 19 months ago.
[01:07:09.975 --> 01:07:12.677]  And his report has links to all the documents and all the groups here in the U.S.
[01:07:12.677 --> 01:07:14.198]  with the numbers.
[01:07:14.198 --> 01:07:16.720]  These people are just monsters, man.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:20.704]  But again, the public cannot believe they're being hit by something like this.
[01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:21.524]  So I mentioned this.
[01:07:21.524 --> 01:07:23.526]  I'm going to play these Klaus Schwab clips.
[01:07:23.526 --> 01:07:24.587]  One is new.
[01:07:24.587 --> 01:07:25.868]  Embracing the CCP.
[01:07:25.868 --> 01:07:27.889]  That's the Communist Party of China.
[01:07:27.889 --> 01:07:30.751]  Who are the greatest mass murderers in history.
[01:07:30.751 --> 01:07:34.554]  The CIA says they killed 80 million people.
[01:07:34.554 --> 01:07:36.516]  In their fact book online.
[01:07:36.516 --> 01:07:39.058]  The CHICOMs go, no, actually 100 million we killed.
[01:07:40.709 --> 01:07:48.491]  So they even admit that under Mao, it was 80 million, and then they killed 20 million cents, and they officially say, well, that's just a good price to pay.
[01:07:48.491 --> 01:07:52.812]  Now, by the way, if you're a new listener and haven't studied the Chai comms, go look that up.
[01:07:52.812 --> 01:07:55.092]  The Chinese communists say they killed 100 million.
[01:07:55.092 --> 01:07:58.613]  CIA says 84 million.
[01:07:58.613 --> 01:08:08.835]  It's just like if I say I've got a Madeleine Albright clip on 60 Minutes where they say, well, you tripled the sanctions on Iraq of what the Bushes had, Bush Senior, and it killed 2 million people, 500,000 of them children,
[01:08:10.345 --> 01:08:11.426]  Was that a good price to pay?
[01:08:11.426 --> 01:08:12.127]  She says, yeah.
[01:08:12.127 --> 01:08:13.168]  I'd kill 500,000 again.
[01:08:13.168 --> 01:08:15.470]  It's a good thing I did.
[01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:20.455]  Wouldn't give them penicillin.
[01:08:20.455 --> 01:08:21.816]  And they were a one-crop economy.
[01:08:21.816 --> 01:08:23.057]  Oil in that country, they couldn't.
[01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:23.918]  They produced some food.
[01:08:23.918 --> 01:08:25.459]  That was it.
[01:08:25.459 --> 01:08:28.142]  How about you for five, six, seven years?
[01:08:28.142 --> 01:08:29.724]  You don't get any medicine.
[01:08:29.724 --> 01:08:31.085]  You don't get fuel.
[01:08:31.085 --> 01:08:33.467]  You don't get energy.
[01:08:33.467 --> 01:08:35.249]  Sit there and watch your four-year-old get a cold.
[01:08:36.488 --> 01:08:39.249]  Their immune system's already run down because they've been on antibiotics before.
[01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:41.090]  Now they die in your arms.
[01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:43.051]  Madeleine Albright's a big, fat, ugly woman.
[01:08:43.051 --> 01:08:45.573]  They're like, well, she's a big, fat, ugly woman.
[01:08:45.573 --> 01:08:46.173]  That's all right.
[01:08:46.173 --> 01:08:47.894]  I was a big, fat, ugly woman.
[01:08:47.894 --> 01:08:48.854]  I was not a man.
[01:08:48.854 --> 01:08:51.956]  Big ol' fat, disgusting little conehead.
[01:08:51.956 --> 01:08:54.197]  Like a monkey.
[01:08:54.197 --> 01:08:56.538]  We gotta celebrate, though, because she's a woman.
[01:08:56.538 --> 01:08:57.779]  Disgusting murderer.
[01:08:57.779 --> 01:08:59.279]  Burn in hell.
[01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:00.480]  Cowardly filth.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.200]  We were at Bilderberg.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.861]  It was 2000... 2000 and...
[01:09:07.201 --> 01:09:07.622]  18 or something.
[01:09:07.622 --> 01:09:08.002]  I forget.
[01:09:08.002 --> 01:09:09.804]  Chantilly, Virginia.
[01:09:09.804 --> 01:09:11.766]  And I had gone to get something to eat.
[01:09:11.766 --> 01:09:13.367]  It was like getting dark.
[01:09:13.367 --> 01:09:14.929]  They had troops all around everywhere.
[01:09:14.929 --> 01:09:16.730]  The news was saying it doesn't exist.
[01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:17.511]  Jones is insane.
[01:09:17.511 --> 01:09:24.637]  There are times Jones is insane, running around in Virginia outside a hotel, claiming there's a new world order.
[01:09:24.637 --> 01:09:28.341]  Jones is reporting imaginary men in black
[01:09:29.501 --> 01:09:33.163]  Uh, and, and helicopters, you know, they had marines there and helicopters and everything else.
[01:09:33.163 --> 01:09:34.564]  We have video of it.
[01:09:34.564 --> 01:09:36.084]  I stayed in there until it opened.
[01:09:36.084 --> 01:09:38.625]  And the King of Spain comes in, they play the national anthem.
[01:09:38.625 --> 01:09:39.946]  I have all this on video.
[01:09:39.946 --> 01:09:42.607]  And the New York Times says it doesn't exist.
[01:09:42.607 --> 01:09:44.188]  A little bit different when they met last month.
[01:09:44.188 --> 01:09:46.809]  All over the news, yes, the world leaders are meeting.
[01:09:46.809 --> 01:09:48.450]  Secretly decide how to save you.
[01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:52.272]  Vildenberg, of course, is real, but... Madeleine Albright pulled up.
[01:09:53.476 --> 01:10:06.402]  In front of my crew that she ran on, and she, when she took the wrong turn and drove up to peaceful protesters and just people with cameras, she literally started crying like, and drove out the other way and reportedly never came back.
[01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:10.204]  She was driving a little Mercedes convertible.
[01:10:10.204 --> 01:10:17.608]  So she's out having fun, mass murdering, pulls in and sees some cameras and people and literally craps a brick.
[01:10:17.608 --> 01:10:19.048]  It's all right, cause she's a woman.
[01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:20.189]  She wears a skirt.
[01:10:20.189 --> 01:10:22.630]  Murder the murder me liberal woman.
[01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:24.311]  She's so powerful.
[01:10:24.311 --> 01:10:30.336]  It's like when Hillary says, I came, I saw, he died.
[01:10:30.336 --> 01:10:37.282]  That woman can't wipe her ugly, pork-covered butt.
[01:10:37.282 --> 01:10:41.225]  She can sure as hell give you orders to kill your ass.
[01:10:41.225 --> 01:10:43.647]  While Obama's in bed with Big Mike.
[01:10:43.647 --> 01:10:45.429]  Because he's really good at killing people.
[01:10:45.429 --> 01:10:47.471]  Remember he said that.
[01:10:47.471 --> 01:10:49.873]  I'm really... In fact, get the Madeline Albright clip ready.
[01:10:49.873 --> 01:10:50.193]  Find it.
[01:10:50.894 --> 01:10:55.695]  And then get Obama, he said a couple times, saying, I'm really good at killing people.
[01:10:55.695 --> 01:10:59.076]  He goes, Predator drones.
[01:10:59.076 --> 01:11:04.116]  He said both, I'm really good at killing people and two words, Predator drones.
[01:11:04.116 --> 01:11:10.898]  And then maybe get the George W. Bush joke where he's at the National Press Club and he goes, nope, no W and D's here, none are there, they're all lying.
[01:11:10.898 --> 01:11:14.398]  You just killed all these more people, but it's all right, you're laughing about it.
[01:11:14.398 --> 01:11:18.139]  You're George W. Bush, boy, you can do whatever you want.
[01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:25.652]  They just think we're here to be killed, we're here to be run over, we're here to be pissed on?
[01:11:25.652 --> 01:11:27.694]  I tell you we're not.
[01:11:27.694 --> 01:11:32.798]  So, let's go ahead and play this clip.
[01:11:32.798 --> 01:11:36.180]  This is Klaus Schwab.
[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:39.623]  And remember, it's not the COVID that killed millions.
[01:11:39.623 --> 01:11:44.446]  It's not the COVID that starved 30-something million to death in the last three and a half years with the lockdowns.
[01:11:44.446 --> 01:11:45.287]  It was the lockdowns.
[01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:50.729]  And they did it, using this, and like they say, oh, global warming is the reason the border collapsed.
[01:11:50.729 --> 01:11:52.731]  No, you ordered it to be stand down.
[01:11:52.731 --> 01:11:54.792]  And you told the illegals to come here.
[01:11:54.792 --> 01:12:00.837]  And you incentivized them to come here by shutting off where they work and where they live.
[01:12:00.837 --> 01:12:03.419]  And then John Kerry goes, we're being flooded, you see, it's global warming.
[01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:06.442]  No, it's your policies, you monster.
[01:12:06.442 --> 01:12:11.946]  John Kerry's always, he gives a speech now, he's like a bug.
[01:12:16.346 --> 01:12:21.049]  All right, here's Klaus Schwab.
[01:12:21.049 --> 01:12:25.573]  History is truly at a turning point.
[01:12:25.573 --> 01:12:33.378]  Global energy systems, food systems, and supply chains will be deeply affected.
[01:12:33.378 --> 01:12:39.142]  In times of crisis, the role of governments is more important.
[01:12:39.142 --> 01:12:39.783]  Back it up a start.
[01:12:39.783 --> 01:12:41.384]  Just imagine what you're hearing.
[01:12:41.384 --> 01:12:44.046]  This is two and a half years ago, in the heights of lockdown,
[01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:47.331]  This is three years ago, excuse me.
[01:12:47.331 --> 01:12:50.754]  And he's like, there will be deep effect.
[01:12:50.754 --> 01:12:53.237]  And then later they put out little videos, remember saying, oh, it was good.
[01:12:53.237 --> 01:12:54.378]  The animals were happy.
[01:12:54.378 --> 01:12:55.359]  Humans weren't out there.
[01:12:55.359 --> 01:12:56.880]  There wasn't the sound of cars.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:04.767]  Well, the whole infrastructure got sent back decades, like taking a rug and pulling it off from under somebody.
[01:13:04.767 --> 01:13:07.270]  He later said, this is very good to disrupt.
[01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:09.051]  Mass death, mass starvation.
[01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:10.232]  This your little friend.
[01:13:10.232 --> 01:13:10.793]  Sorry, go back to him.
[01:13:11.806 --> 01:13:16.316]  History is truly at a turning point.
[01:13:16.316 --> 01:13:22.409]  Global energy systems, food systems and supply chains will be deeply affected.
[01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:31.813]  In times of crisis, the role of governments is more important and more relevant than ever.
[01:13:31.813 --> 01:13:42.116]  The profound challenges to mankind, such as climate change, are globally interconnected and require collaborative responses.
[01:13:45.134 --> 01:13:55.356]  He's the ex-premier of the People's Republic of China, and a member of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee Politburo Standing Committee.
[01:13:55.356 --> 01:13:57.276]  Hit pause again.
[01:13:57.276 --> 01:14:00.157]  Back it up to the start of clip two.
[01:14:00.157 --> 01:14:01.857]  He's about to have an orgasm.
[01:14:01.857 --> 01:14:04.938]  The number two in the party!
[01:14:04.938 --> 01:14:07.738]  He has a bust of linen in his office.
[01:14:07.738 --> 01:14:10.499]  So he's told you, we're collapsing everything, we're going to pose as the saviors.
[01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:14.431]  Now he's Premier Lee!
[01:14:14.431 --> 01:14:16.433]  More communism!
[01:14:16.433 --> 01:14:19.555]  The power of what we have is real!
[01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:22.196]  I mean, you're seeing a real Bond villain.
[01:14:22.196 --> 01:14:24.858]  That people like Dr. Evil are based on this.
[01:14:24.858 --> 01:14:26.659]  It's not like he's trying to look like a Bond villain.
[01:14:26.659 --> 01:14:30.001]  This is the actual group that Ian Fleming based him on.
[01:14:30.001 --> 01:14:32.443]  This is what Klaus Schwab's dad and grandfather look like.
[01:14:32.443 --> 01:14:34.264]  They're making flamethrowers for Hitler.
[01:14:34.264 --> 01:14:37.185]  Go back to him.
[01:14:37.185 --> 01:14:37.786]  Premier Lee.
[01:14:38.914 --> 01:14:51.383]  is the ex-premier of the People's Republic of China and a member of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee Politburo Standing Committee.
[01:14:51.383 --> 01:15:07.274]  Premier Li has a distinguished career in public service, having led the economic and social development of three major provinces, Zhejiang,
[01:15:09.959 --> 01:15:29.731]  He has also been instrumental in opening up China's capital market, attracting foreign investment and innovation, and creating new urban areas to address land scarcity.
[01:15:31.305 --> 01:15:54.011]  Premier Li took his office this March at China's National People's Congress at a critical moment when China adopted new COVID control measures and started to boost economic development, social dynamism and international cooperation.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.941]  Truly disgusting.
[01:15:58.941 --> 01:16:10.231]  Again, the Chai Khams, in their own words, have killed over 100 million of their own people.
[01:16:10.231 --> 01:16:12.493]  And Klaus Schwab says they are the model of the world.
[01:16:12.493 --> 01:16:14.414]  So does his mini-me.
[01:16:14.414 --> 01:16:21.921]  You all know Harari and his other mini-me, Justin Trudeau.
[01:16:21.921 --> 01:16:24.203]  He penetrates the cabinets.
[01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:41.073]  You know, a lot of new clips that are old clips are resurfing on the web, and I really want to thank the viewers and listeners that are taking clips out of the shows and posting them on Twitter, Instagram, but also Rumble and Gab and everywhere else, and on YouTube.
[01:16:41.073 --> 01:16:43.995]  As long as you don't put my name in it, you don't have to make bigger problems.
[01:16:43.995 --> 01:16:48.218]  We're reaching tens of millions of people a day because of you and with the truth.
[01:16:48.218 --> 01:16:51.321]  And it's the old clips that are really the most important.
[01:16:51.321 --> 01:16:52.502]  I saw this clip two days ago.
[01:16:53.436 --> 01:16:56.058]  On InfoOrange.com, and I thought, wow, that's a really important clip.
[01:16:56.058 --> 01:17:05.643]  It shows I'm going off their own documents, that I had their battle plan, that this is real, and that I'm going to tell you what's coming next off their own battle plan, and you can go read it for yourself and know how to beat them.
[01:17:05.643 --> 01:17:13.868]  But people, they listen to me now, because they see what I talk about come true, but they really listen to the old clips.
[01:17:13.868 --> 01:17:21.853]  And so we played this yesterday, and it's since gone viral, got over a million views, and I thought we'd play it again just to encourage others to keep uploading this,
[01:17:22.683 --> 01:17:26.047]  Because it's only a minute and a half clip and it just says it all.
[01:17:26.047 --> 01:17:27.849]  Here it is.
[01:17:27.849 --> 01:17:37.780]  And right before the break I was reading some of those quotes by Adam Murrow and others coming out saying it's time to basically wipe out the third world.
[01:17:39.055 --> 01:17:58.765]  And notice this is normally from liberal academics and naturalists who say they're for multiculturalism and, you know, get rid of the family and teach homosexuality and all this just so people don't have any unifying culture left and so that it's not cool to have children.
[01:17:59.665 --> 01:18:02.066]  It's literally ultimate greed.
[01:18:02.066 --> 01:18:17.031]  They're attacking the West that they see as their main challenge, number one, while attacking the third world just out of hand because there's no media complex or government complex or cultural complex in the third world that can organize against this.
[01:18:17.031 --> 01:18:21.953]  But David Attenborough has come out and stated what is in all their publications.
[01:18:21.953 --> 01:18:24.334]  They're on record hitting us with psychotronic.
[01:18:25.955 --> 01:18:37.043]  They're on record designing all the GMO with recombinant RNA and DNA weapon systems.
[01:18:37.043 --> 01:18:39.525]  Really, it's nanotech, but genetically based.
[01:18:39.525 --> 01:18:48.392]  They are hitting us all with hundreds of chemicals in the water supply with hydrofluorosilic acid as the boosting adjuvant.
[01:18:48.652 --> 01:18:50.814]  This is all on record.
[01:18:50.814 --> 01:18:54.137]  Silent weapons for quiet wars, Pentagon documents.
[01:18:54.137 --> 01:18:56.699]  I'm giving you the names right now.
[01:18:56.699 --> 01:19:02.804]  Soft Kill, Prospectus, 1968, MIT, Stanford Research Institute.
[01:19:02.804 --> 01:19:04.826]  I mean, I'm giving it all to you right now.
[01:19:04.826 --> 01:19:07.027]  Anybody that wants to go find out about this.
[01:19:07.027 --> 01:19:15.695]  And the insane part is, the Pentagon, the CIA people, 99.9% of them are compartmentalized and are all being attacked by this as well.
[01:19:17.145 --> 01:19:18.906]  There will be no winners in this.
[01:19:18.906 --> 01:19:21.809]  They're going to kill everybody.
[01:19:21.809 --> 01:19:38.884]  And right now you just see them trying to shut down the final sovereign nations, trying to develop their super weapons, their nanotech, putting it in place, trying to set up their new takeover system of the internet that was always designed for this reason.
[01:19:38.884 --> 01:19:40.085]  So that's the big picture.
[01:19:44.958 --> 01:19:45.778]  No one's safe.
[01:19:45.778 --> 01:19:46.859]  No one's going to escape this.
[01:19:46.859 --> 01:19:49.720]  They're going to kill everybody.
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:50.820]  And they now say that.
[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:53.501]  Yuval Harari, Ray Kurzweil, they say.
[01:19:53.501 --> 01:19:54.941]  Humans won't be around soon.
[01:19:54.941 --> 01:19:56.182]  It's the time of humans has come to an end.
[01:19:56.182 --> 01:20:00.063]  They've really bought into this spirit, this thing, saying they're going to merge the machines and become gods.
[01:20:00.063 --> 01:20:03.584]  And remember, it's now two years ago.
[01:20:03.584 --> 01:20:04.464]  We should find it again.
[01:20:04.464 --> 01:20:11.266]  William Shatner, uh, goes up in Blue Origin or whatever.
[01:20:11.266 --> 01:20:13.147]  I don't know that Blue Origin is what, uh,
[01:20:14.301 --> 01:20:28.347]  The Virgin guy calls it, whatever the space company of Bezos is, and he goes up there in this pod, and this capsule, and he looks down, and he lands, and he goes, I was up there just looking at the cataclysm that's about to happen.
[01:20:28.347 --> 01:20:30.027]  This was during the COVID lockdowns.
[01:20:30.027 --> 01:20:35.869]  Now almost everybody's got to die for the Earth, and I just thought it's so sad they're all going to die.
[01:20:35.869 --> 01:20:37.050]  Everyone will be dead soon.
[01:20:37.050 --> 01:20:38.751]  They're like, Mr. Shatner, please come over here.
[01:20:38.751 --> 01:20:42.232]  Because he's been read in.
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:45.921]  And I said that a long time ago.
[01:20:45.921 --> 01:20:47.062]  I know people that know Shatner.
[01:20:47.062 --> 01:20:48.002]  He's a really nice guy.
[01:20:48.002 --> 01:20:51.084]  And he almost came on the show.
[01:20:51.084 --> 01:20:51.825]  I like William Shatner.
[01:20:51.825 --> 01:20:53.726]  What a character.
[01:20:53.726 --> 01:20:55.767]  He's just like, transhumanism?
[01:20:55.767 --> 01:20:56.528]  I want to live forever.
[01:20:56.528 --> 01:20:58.890]  I go to the conferences and I meet with the globalists.
[01:20:58.890 --> 01:21:03.132]  They tell me how it all works and I just want to live.
[01:21:03.132 --> 01:21:04.493]  They told me everybody's about to die.
[01:21:04.493 --> 01:21:06.174]  Well, I'm not supposed to talk about that.
[01:21:06.174 --> 01:21:10.797]  Well, you're all about to be dead.
[01:21:10.797 --> 01:21:11.618]  So they found the clip.
[01:21:17.332 --> 01:21:18.272]  The crew's so great.
[01:21:18.272 --> 01:21:20.473]  I asked for so much stuff.
[01:21:20.473 --> 01:21:21.553]  There's another clip I want to play.
[01:21:21.553 --> 01:21:22.653]  What was the clip I asked for?
[01:21:22.653 --> 01:21:24.313]  You guys combined two clips.
[01:21:24.313 --> 01:21:27.814]  What was it?
[01:21:27.814 --> 01:21:30.335]  Obama bragging about, I came, I saw they die.
[01:21:30.335 --> 01:21:31.195]  I used drones.
[01:21:31.195 --> 01:21:33.455]  Hillary, I came, I saw they died.
[01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:39.036]  And then we've got, of course, Mel.
[01:21:39.036 --> 01:21:39.676]  All right.
[01:21:39.676 --> 01:21:41.537]  Well, you killed 500,000 children knowing.
[01:21:41.537 --> 01:21:42.677]  We're not giving them penicillin.
[01:21:44.083 --> 01:21:47.344]  And no medical supplies for at least, you know, the last seven, eight years of your administration.
[01:21:47.344 --> 01:21:47.884]  She goes, yeah, it's good.
[01:21:47.884 --> 01:21:49.724]  I'll do it again.
[01:21:49.724 --> 01:21:51.504]  I'm a big fat ugly woman.
[01:21:51.504 --> 01:21:52.925]  I get to murder you.
[01:21:52.925 --> 01:21:57.506]  I get to murder you.
[01:21:57.506 --> 01:22:00.806]  It's so incredibly liberal.
[01:22:00.806 --> 01:22:04.907]  And because she looks like one of those goblins from Harry Potter.
[01:22:04.907 --> 01:22:05.207]  It's okay.
[01:22:05.207 --> 01:22:06.507]  It's like, well, you look like a goblin.
[01:22:06.507 --> 01:22:09.028]  We got to let you kill us.
[01:22:09.028 --> 01:22:09.808]  Well, it's incredible.
[01:22:09.808 --> 01:22:10.588]  It even came out.
[01:22:11.909 --> 01:22:17.130]  When she was on 60 Minutes, not just her saying, you know, it's a good price to pay to kill everybody.
[01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:22.992]  Behind her was a famous stolen painting that the Nazis stole, and they killed the Jew that painted it.
[01:22:22.992 --> 01:22:33.374]  And of course, her father especially was like, he was like way above George Soros in the level of it, going around robbing fellow Jews, and then handing him over to the Nazis.
[01:22:33.374 --> 01:22:37.155]  But it was a famous, you look this up, Madeleine Albright caught with stolen painting of Holocaust victim.
[01:22:37.894 --> 01:22:42.738]  And so her dad went and would tell Jews he'd get them out of the country and then turn them over to the Nazis.
[01:22:42.738 --> 01:22:43.739]  This is on record.
[01:22:43.739 --> 01:22:46.041]  And then he ran to Serbia and they saved him.
[01:22:46.041 --> 01:22:57.691]  And when she launched the attack on Belgrade and bombed them with DU and let the Muslims take over and throw the country and just slaughter the Serbs, because it was liberal, of course, they said, why are you doing this to us?
[01:22:57.691 --> 01:22:58.432]  We saved you.
[01:22:58.432 --> 01:23:05.037]  And she said, I'd round, my father rounded up Jews and took their property.
[01:23:05.037 --> 01:23:05.838]  I'll kill you too.
[01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.750]  I mean, just think about it.
[01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:11.151]  It's just like George Soros.
[01:23:11.151 --> 01:23:13.752]  George Soros said it was the best time of my life rounding up Jews.
[01:23:13.752 --> 01:23:14.793]  I'd do it again.
[01:23:14.793 --> 01:23:16.033]  It was happy making.
[01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:17.494]  It was exhilarating.
[01:23:17.494 --> 01:23:18.594]  You know, it's like markets.
[01:23:18.594 --> 01:23:19.335]  I feel no guilt.
[01:23:19.335 --> 01:23:22.856]  If I didn't do it, somebody else would do it.
[01:23:22.856 --> 01:23:24.057]  What must that feel like?
[01:23:24.057 --> 01:23:35.061]  Like, well, if I don't just, you know, pistol whip this person and take their car and shoot him in the ditch, somebody else would do it.
[01:23:35.061 --> 01:23:36.982]  Total psychotic demon.
[01:23:38.902 --> 01:23:40.203]  But they know you've got a conscious.
[01:23:40.203 --> 01:23:43.966]  They say, you better let me take control of your body or you're a Nazi.
[01:23:43.966 --> 01:23:48.209]  You better let me take your bank account or you're Hitler.
[01:23:48.209 --> 01:23:51.412]  And so people are now revolting, saying, well then, you know, Hitler's not bad.
[01:23:51.412 --> 01:23:52.793]  No, Hitler was bad too.
[01:23:52.793 --> 01:23:57.697]  He was just a competing faction with these people.
[01:23:57.697 --> 01:23:59.238]  That's all.
[01:23:59.238 --> 01:24:04.162]  He saw predatory globalist organizations and groups in the British Empire, and he wanted to be the predatory group.
[01:24:04.162 --> 01:24:07.785]  So he was just another predator.
[01:24:07.785 --> 01:24:08.105]  Hitler's
[01:24:09.625 --> 01:24:17.469]  I mean, on a scale, the British Empire, Hitler, the ADL, George Soros, they're all a 10.
[01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:21.732]  As evil as you can be, they're always trying to be more ruthless, more evil.
[01:24:21.732 --> 01:24:23.393]  They see it as manly, as powerful.
[01:24:23.393 --> 01:24:31.937]  They have no morals to hate everyone, even their own families, and just hate, and just steal, and just hurt.
[01:24:31.937 --> 01:24:36.640]  And they're Chinese, and they're Anglo, and they're African, and they're
[01:24:38.416 --> 01:24:43.380]  Latin America, they're every group, they're Arab.
[01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:46.202]  They're evil.
[01:24:46.202 --> 01:24:48.384]  There's evil white people, there's good white people.
[01:24:48.384 --> 01:24:50.445]  There's good Christians, there's bad Christians.
[01:24:50.445 --> 01:24:52.047]  False Christians.
[01:24:52.047 --> 01:24:53.728]  And there's good Jews, there's bad Jews.
[01:24:53.728 --> 01:24:57.751]  And there's good Nigerians, there's bad Nigerians.
[01:24:57.751 --> 01:25:02.795]  And we have to recognize that people like George Soros hide behind what they did.
[01:25:02.795 --> 01:25:06.538]  They want to intimidate us, to not have the nerve to call him out.
[01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:08.071]  We do.
[01:25:08.071 --> 01:25:09.872]  And we're never going to shut up and we're winning.
[01:25:09.872 --> 01:25:15.516]  And humanity, together, every race, color, and creed are going to go to the stars.
[01:25:15.516 --> 01:25:19.239]  And all you people that serve evil are going to be left in the ash heap of history.
[01:25:19.239 --> 01:25:21.901]  But here's some of your little bloodthirsty globalists here.
[01:25:21.901 --> 01:25:23.242]  I mentioned a bunch of them.
[01:25:23.242 --> 01:25:25.985]  You probably just have a whole bloodthirsty continuum.
[01:25:25.985 --> 01:25:28.867]  I mean, there's so many clips.
[01:25:28.867 --> 01:25:31.409]  George W. Bush makes jokes about WMDs.
[01:25:31.409 --> 01:25:32.810]  No WMDs under here?
[01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:33.891]  Wait, none under there?
[01:25:33.891 --> 01:25:35.372]  I don't know what they put together, but here it is.
[01:25:38.457 --> 01:25:40.899]  We have heard that half a million children have died.
[01:25:40.899 --> 01:25:46.903]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[01:25:46.903 --> 01:25:51.206]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[01:25:51.206 --> 01:25:53.447]  I think this is a very hard choice.
[01:25:53.447 --> 01:25:59.211]  But the price, we think the price is worth it.
[01:25:59.211 --> 01:26:00.272]  Unconfirmed videos.
[01:26:00.272 --> 01:26:02.693]  We came, saw, he died.
[01:26:02.693 --> 01:26:06.296]  The Jonas Brothers are here.
[01:26:08.578 --> 01:26:11.220]  They're out there somewhere.
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:14.603]  Sasha and Malia are huge fans.
[01:26:14.603 --> 01:26:17.686]  But boys don't get any ideas.
[01:26:17.686 --> 01:26:19.588]  I have two words for you.
[01:26:19.588 --> 01:26:22.751]  Predator drones.
[01:26:22.751 --> 01:26:29.136]  You will never see it coming.
[01:26:29.136 --> 01:26:29.837]  You think I'm joking.
[01:26:34.401 --> 01:26:34.842]  Ten minutes.
[01:26:34.842 --> 01:26:35.603]  It had everything.
[01:26:35.603 --> 01:26:37.146]  We're so happy you're here.
[01:26:37.146 --> 01:26:37.947]  It had everything.
[01:26:37.947 --> 01:26:39.049]  And the realization once again.
[01:26:43.152 --> 01:26:50.615]  The fragility of this planet, the coming catastrophic event, and we all have to clean this act up now.
[01:26:50.615 --> 01:26:52.015]  Well said.
[01:26:52.015 --> 01:26:57.097]  I kept thinking about that, saying they said when you go to space, they should have sent a poet, you know, to describe it.
[01:26:57.097 --> 01:26:57.977]  Well, they kind of did.
[01:26:57.977 --> 01:27:00.998]  Bill Shatner, thank you for your poetry.
[01:27:00.998 --> 01:27:02.599]  Glad you had so much fun.
[01:27:02.599 --> 01:27:07.040]  And he's actually going to be back in our third hour with more to share.
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:09.561]  And every time I ask for that, we pull up that clip.
[01:27:10.419 --> 01:27:18.524]  He was quoted in the news, and there's video when he gets off the pod, saying, I'm so sad the cataclysmic event, everybody's going to have to die, all those people down there.
[01:27:18.524 --> 01:27:20.346]  But we'll find it.
[01:27:20.346 --> 01:27:23.468]  But that, good job.
[01:27:23.468 --> 01:27:26.790]  And then again, he gave interviews and books saying, I'm really good at killing people.
[01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:30.973]  So it's just spectacular how disconnected from reality these folks are.
[01:27:30.973 --> 01:27:32.954]  All right, I said I'd give the number out.
[01:27:34.679 --> 01:27:38.280]  877-789-2539.
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:41.101]  877-789-Alex.
[01:27:41.101 --> 01:27:41.641]  877-789-2539.
[01:27:41.641 --> 01:27:49.503]  And maybe we'll punch up the phone system here so I can see it and take the calls, but 877-789-2539.
[01:27:49.503 --> 01:27:55.144]  Please don't forget we're running the biggest sale of the year so far, and your purchases are critical to our continued operation.
[01:27:55.144 --> 01:27:57.785]  But really, that's a side issue.
[01:27:57.785 --> 01:27:59.265]  You really need Nitric Boost.
[01:27:59.265 --> 01:28:02.226]  You really need Ultimate Fish Oil, Ultimate Critical Oil for your heart, your brain,
[01:28:03.044 --> 01:28:07.786]  You normally need all this anyways, but the quality of life you get out of this.
[01:28:07.786 --> 01:28:17.711]  People take nitric boost and they say they have the libido of it and you know their muscles get healthier and plumper and things, but I mean it's just when I forget to take it, I've been out of town for a week and a half, I'm like I forgot to bring it with me.
[01:28:17.711 --> 01:28:18.711]  I'm like I'm feeling it.
[01:28:19.745 --> 01:28:19.966]  I think?
[01:28:34.269 --> 01:28:40.615]  The fish oil and the nitric boost for your heart, your lungs, your brain, with all the stuff that's going on right now, that's so critical.
[01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:44.339]  And I would also get TurboForce that's selling out.
[01:28:44.339 --> 01:28:45.840]  It's 25% off, 10 hours of energy.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:49.784]  We have BrainForce Plus and BrainForce Ultra, two different great nootropics.
[01:28:49.784 --> 01:28:54.929]  They're both 50% off, discounted right now as well.
[01:28:54.929 --> 01:28:58.793]  And we just have the great CBD, 1000 milligram, and then we have the lower milligram.
[01:29:00.936 --> 01:29:07.379]  Two of our best-selling nootropics, or Brain Boosters, are now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:29:07.379 --> 01:29:12.302]  For a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together, or 40% off when you get them individually.
[01:29:12.302 --> 01:29:14.963]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra.
[01:29:14.963 --> 01:29:16.664]  Two separate formulas.
[01:29:16.664 --> 01:29:19.005]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[01:29:19.625 --> 01:29:25.228]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy, again with no hangover or letdown.
[01:29:25.228 --> 01:29:30.831]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula, that's Brave Force Ultra, that hits really, really quick.
[01:29:30.831 --> 01:29:31.291]  And I love it.
[01:29:31.291 --> 01:29:32.752]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[01:29:32.752 --> 01:29:37.014]  So if I've got to work at night, but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and stay nine o'clock at night.
[01:29:37.014 --> 01:29:40.156]  Got to stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview or something, and boom!
[01:29:41.237 --> 01:29:41.457]  Thank you.
[01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:07.807]  Two amazing nootropics, that means brain power, are back in stock at InfoWarsTour.com, and they're both 50% off.
[01:30:07.807 --> 01:30:12.031]  We haven't offered these for 50% off since last Christmas.
[01:30:12.031 --> 01:30:16.034]  These are amazing products, and for those of you on the fence, I want you to try them.
[01:30:16.034 --> 01:30:20.838]  Brain Force Ultra hits in 15 minutes, only lasts three hours, with no hangover.
[01:30:20.838 --> 01:30:22.199]  It is a game changer.
[01:30:22.199 --> 01:30:23.420]  Nobody's got something close to this.
[01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:27.604]  Then, our BrainForce Plus is a good, basic, clean nootropic.
[01:30:27.604 --> 01:30:32.528]  It gives you four to six hours of amazing energy, again, with no hangover, no jitters.
[01:30:32.528 --> 01:30:34.069]  Both products back in stock.
[01:30:34.069 --> 01:30:38.393]  Infowarrestore.com for 50% off, and it funds the InfoWar.
[01:30:38.393 --> 01:30:41.196]  So get your BrainForce Ultra, your BrainForce Plus, and
[01:30:41.496 --> 01:30:42.017]  We're good.
[01:30:58.829 --> 01:31:03.850]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[01:31:03.850 --> 01:31:06.411]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[01:31:06.411 --> 01:31:07.892]  So let me get this straight.
[01:31:07.892 --> 01:31:27.337]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the Obama administration, Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son, Hunter, to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption, an event that Donald Trump looked into, sparking the first impeachment, enforcing the arming of Ukraine, in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia,
[01:31:27.657 --> 01:31:53.951]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had, but that they swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign, all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents, despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016, when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[01:31:53.951 --> 01:31:55.172]  Do I have that all straight?
[01:31:58.803 --> 01:32:03.666]  This is Adam King, host of the Adam King Show, joined by the one and only Greg Reiss of the Reiss Report.
[01:32:03.666 --> 01:32:07.288]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:07.288 --> 01:32:09.990]  Click this QR code right above Greg Reiss.
[01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:15.893]  Buy yourself a Faraday cage, Super Male Vitality, or what Greg has.
[01:32:15.893 --> 01:32:16.674]  Greg, what do you got there?
[01:32:17.168 --> 01:32:26.136]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice, get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[01:32:26.136 --> 01:32:32.382]  Even if the water pressure goes out, the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[01:32:32.382 --> 01:32:32.922]  Absolutely.
[01:32:35.603 --> 01:32:38.404]  Couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[01:32:38.404 --> 01:32:41.224]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR.
[01:32:41.224 --> 01:32:42.945]  The real NPR of The Based Right.
[01:32:42.945 --> 01:32:45.985]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[01:32:45.985 --> 01:32:46.945]  Take out your phone.
[01:32:46.945 --> 01:32:48.046]  Click that QR code.
[01:32:48.046 --> 01:32:50.206]  It'll take you directly to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:50.206 --> 01:32:51.126]  Buy something.
[01:32:51.126 --> 01:32:52.206]  Support the Info War.
[01:32:52.206 --> 01:32:56.627]  Keep Alex Jones, Lauren Schwoyer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reese, Adam King, and the rest of us on air.
[01:32:56.627 --> 01:32:57.428]  Do it today.
[01:32:57.428 --> 01:32:58.268]  Do it now.
[01:32:58.268 --> 01:32:59.048]  Support the Info War.
[01:33:00.805 --> 01:33:05.429]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:05.429 --> 01:33:06.730]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:33:26.668 --> 01:33:32.173]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:32.173 --> 01:33:40.260]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:44.664]  I know, as negative as all this information is, it can get people down.
[01:33:44.664 --> 01:33:46.906]  Remember, God is in control.
[01:33:46.906 --> 01:33:54.092]  I told you years ago, you would see a major resistance form, you would see the globalists start really having big problems, and that they would start imploding.
[01:33:54.955 --> 01:33:55.836]  And you're seeing that.
[01:33:55.836 --> 01:33:59.719]  Evil is very confident, it's delusional, it's crazy.
[01:33:59.719 --> 01:34:02.181]  And it always goes too far.
[01:34:02.181 --> 01:34:03.602]  And it always destroys itself.
[01:34:03.602 --> 01:34:10.468]  We just have to protect ourselves, and not get tangled up with them, but also stand up for those that evil's attacking.
[01:34:10.468 --> 01:34:11.528]  So it's a tall order.
[01:34:11.528 --> 01:34:17.533]  Help the innocent, help the children, but at the same time, don't get tricked into all-out war with the enemy.
[01:34:17.533 --> 01:34:20.716]  We're doing that right now together, and it's a beautiful time to be alive.
[01:34:20.716 --> 01:34:23.278]  I want to go to OneCardMoney, Jason,
[01:34:24.611 --> 01:34:28.536]  Tim, John, Barbara.
[01:34:28.536 --> 01:34:31.018]  Man, I bought glasses two years ago.
[01:34:31.018 --> 01:34:31.819]  I kind of needed them then.
[01:34:31.819 --> 01:34:32.861]  I really need them now.
[01:34:32.861 --> 01:34:34.823]  And I can't find the two pairs I bought.
[01:34:34.823 --> 01:34:37.366]  One, I found the sunglasses, but I can't find them.
[01:34:37.366 --> 01:34:41.811]  I've got to go to the optometrist when I get back to Austin Sunday, because I can't.
[01:34:42.392 --> 01:34:44.113]  My eyes used to be 2015, man.
[01:34:44.113 --> 01:34:45.814]  I can't read any of this right now.
[01:34:45.814 --> 01:34:47.295]  That's part of my frustration on air, too.
[01:34:47.295 --> 01:34:49.096]  Like, I have to, like, wait, I used to be able to read this!
[01:34:49.096 --> 01:34:49.516]  Read it!
[01:34:49.516 --> 01:34:50.176]  You can see that!
[01:34:50.176 --> 01:34:52.798]  Trying to make it focus is crazy.
[01:34:52.798 --> 01:34:55.319]  But, so that's where we're at here.
[01:34:55.319 --> 01:34:57.420]  In Georgian.
[01:34:57.420 --> 01:34:58.301]  Arizona.
[01:34:58.301 --> 01:35:00.802]  So, so, this is all coming up.
[01:35:00.802 --> 01:35:02.703]  I'm gonna go crazy.
[01:35:02.703 --> 01:35:05.345]  I guess it's good, though, as you know more, you can see and hear less.
[01:35:05.345 --> 01:35:06.966]  It's like, this year's starting to go out.
[01:35:09.816 --> 01:35:12.177]  Oh my goodness.
[01:35:12.177 --> 01:35:16.178]  So we're going to go to your phone calls here in a moment and take those.
[01:35:16.178 --> 01:35:25.420]  And Pastor Scarlett, always a great guy, is going to talk about the human smuggling and more in these videos we've got of it and his research of the border coming up.
[01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:30.382]  And we've got Roseanne Barb tomorrow in the studio.
[01:35:30.382 --> 01:35:31.722]  So I won't be in studio.
[01:35:33.425 --> 01:35:34.946]  Until Monday.
[01:35:34.946 --> 01:35:35.746]  But I will be here every day.
[01:35:35.746 --> 01:35:36.687]  I'm here.
[01:35:36.687 --> 01:35:39.068]  But Roseanne Barr will be in studio tomorrow.
[01:35:39.068 --> 01:35:40.508]  That should be very interesting.
[01:35:40.508 --> 01:35:42.929]  Look forward to her clarifying what she really said.
[01:35:42.929 --> 01:35:45.771]  Because Theo Vaughn put out a video of what she really said.
[01:35:45.771 --> 01:35:48.652]  She said, I should be able to say anything I want.
[01:35:48.652 --> 01:35:51.593]  Like, will they cut that part out?
[01:35:51.593 --> 01:35:52.234]  I think you should.
[01:35:52.234 --> 01:35:54.715]  It's like a litmus test.
[01:35:54.715 --> 01:35:55.815]  I should be able to say the N word.
[01:35:55.815 --> 01:35:56.516]  I don't want to.
[01:35:56.516 --> 01:35:58.457]  I don't like it.
[01:35:58.457 --> 01:36:01.358]  But famously in the OJ Simpson trial, his lawyers use that word.
[01:36:02.856 --> 01:36:05.137]  To invoke emotion.
[01:36:05.137 --> 01:36:07.617]  They're trying to, like, ban books that have the name in it.
[01:36:07.617 --> 01:36:11.278]  The left wants to ban everything except pedophilia.
[01:36:11.278 --> 01:36:27.562]  But I want to go to your phone calls, but here's a really important clip I talked about yesterday, how I went on Piers Morgan in 2013, and there had just been an Indian mob of men in India had just mass gang-raped a bunch of women.
[01:36:27.562 --> 01:36:28.882]  Mob psychology.
[01:36:28.882 --> 01:36:32.343]  And they'd raped some of the women with steel rods until one of them died.
[01:36:33.226 --> 01:36:35.607]  Kind of like Hillary Clinton's first case.
[01:36:35.607 --> 01:36:37.488]  It was a man that raped a young girl.
[01:36:37.488 --> 01:36:40.370]  He kidnapped her with a broomstick and she got him off of it.
[01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:41.911]  And I was saying, you don't blame the broomstick.
[01:36:41.911 --> 01:36:43.231]  You don't blame the steel rod.
[01:36:43.231 --> 01:36:45.253]  You don't blame the gun.
[01:36:45.253 --> 01:36:46.773]  You blame the person that's doing it.
[01:36:46.773 --> 01:36:50.075]  And then you want to know what's happening to their brains.
[01:36:50.075 --> 01:36:51.936]  And we know what's happening to their brains.
[01:36:51.936 --> 01:36:57.719]  On the SSRI inserts, it says it can cause mass murder.
[01:36:57.719 --> 01:36:59.520]  It can cause megalomania.
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:00.821]  It can cause mass shootings.
[01:37:01.528 --> 01:37:08.689]  And Kennedy brings this up, and he says, oh, in a study, 27% increase or whatever, a 30% increase.
[01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:12.870]  Almost every mass shooter that comes out was under psychiatric care and on a bunch of drugs.
[01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:15.390]  It just never gets to the record because of HIPAA.
[01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:19.951]  So where people got past HIPAA, the drug was involved.
[01:37:19.951 --> 01:37:28.333]  But it's not 37%, it's not 40%, whether it was the lunatic Adam Lanza at Sandy Hook.
[01:37:28.333 --> 01:37:30.153]  Yeah, I didn't kill the kids, everybody thinks that.
[01:37:30.865 --> 01:37:44.030]  Alex Jones, no, Adam Lanza was on a bunch of drugs, Harrison Kleibold, Columbine, the cruise guy in Florida, Parkland, the guy that attacked the movie theater in Colorado.
[01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:45.631]  I mean, just they're all on this stuff.
[01:37:45.631 --> 01:37:48.372]  They're whacked out of their brains.
[01:37:48.372 --> 01:37:54.794]  A few years ago, some Asian guy with no criminal record was in a Walmart and just shot a cop, then he got shot.
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:58.962]  And I said, I bet that guy was on Xanax and alcohol.
[01:37:58.962 --> 01:38:00.463]  Xanax and alcohol.
[01:38:00.463 --> 01:38:02.224]  Just do not think you're in a video game.
[01:38:02.224 --> 01:38:05.746]  And that's why it's video game players, and I'm not saying be in the video games.
[01:38:05.746 --> 01:38:09.508]  99% of people playing shoot-em-up video games, five hours a day, are not going to go out and kill people.
[01:38:09.508 --> 01:38:19.474]  But when you're playing shoot-em-up video games four or five hours a day, and then you take three Xanax and drink a half bottle of vodka, you think you're in the shooting game, because your brain's programmed to that.
[01:38:19.474 --> 01:38:23.276]  And that's why almost all of them are on drugs and shoot-em-up video games.
[01:38:25.146 --> 01:38:26.427]  A lot of pushback on that one.
[01:38:26.427 --> 01:38:27.868]  I said that 20 years ago.
[01:38:27.868 --> 01:38:35.595]  Video games, shoot-em-up video games were created by the Pentagon in the 60s to train people.
[01:38:35.595 --> 01:38:38.998]  They'd hesitate to shoot a person up close, even the Marines.
[01:38:38.998 --> 01:38:40.539]  Don't worry, you're attacking me?
[01:38:40.539 --> 01:38:41.260]  I'm not going to hesitate.
[01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:42.541]  I've got a killer instinct.
[01:38:42.541 --> 01:38:44.582]  But the point is, that's genetic.
[01:38:44.582 --> 01:38:46.304]  I don't want to hurt innocent people, too.
[01:38:46.304 --> 01:38:51.248]  Conrad Lorenz, human-animal psychology, is the most aggressive people, but also the most loving on average.
[01:38:51.704 --> 01:38:54.206]  But the point is a lot of people do not have the killer instinct.
[01:38:54.206 --> 01:38:59.752]  So they train you with video games to have the killer instinct to at that moment kill when you need to kill.
[01:38:59.752 --> 01:39:01.814]  And don't worry, I don't want to kill anybody.
[01:39:01.814 --> 01:39:03.815]  But if I have to, I will.
[01:39:03.815 --> 01:39:06.898]  And I won't hesitate once my brain tells me now's the time to kill.
[01:39:06.898 --> 01:39:09.381]  But that's what video games do is they get rid of that inhibition.
[01:39:09.381 --> 01:39:10.882]  They create instinctive shooting.
[01:39:10.882 --> 01:39:11.823]  That's a term.
[01:39:11.823 --> 01:39:13.164]  So here's that short video.
[01:39:13.164 --> 01:39:13.845]  We'll go right to your calls.
[01:39:14.756 --> 01:39:15.837]  How about Prozac?
[01:39:15.837 --> 01:39:18.119]  You know the number one... Oh, that's the big sponsor, isn't it?
[01:39:18.119 --> 01:39:19.160]  Or that whole class of drugs.
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:19.880]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:21.542]  Oh, whoa, gotta cut that off, don't you?
[01:39:21.542 --> 01:39:23.564]  Don't want to talk about the U.S.
[01:39:23.564 --> 01:39:29.268]  number one cause of death is suicide now because they give people suicide mass murder pills.
[01:39:29.268 --> 01:39:29.649]  Calm down.
[01:39:29.649 --> 01:39:34.893]  Your answer is give more money to the psychiatrists and psychologists and put more crazy people on drugs that make them kill people, Pierce.
[01:39:34.893 --> 01:39:36.354]  Let's try and have a debate here.
[01:39:36.354 --> 01:39:37.655]  My policy...
[01:39:38.696 --> 01:39:38.896]  I think?
[01:39:57.996 --> 01:40:03.438]  The other thing we need to look at is the other reasons why this may be happening in our country.
[01:40:03.438 --> 01:40:11.140]  And you know, I've gotten ridiculed for saying that we need to look at the issue of the SSRIs.
[01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:12.901]  But it's one of the issues we need to look at.
[01:40:12.901 --> 01:40:24.204]  We need to look at video games, we need to look at the way that social media is affecting people's behaviors, and do the scientific studies that are required for that.
[01:40:24.204 --> 01:40:26.625]  There has never been a time in human history
[01:40:27.810 --> 01:40:32.978]  When strangers would walk into a- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I-
[01:40:33.766 --> 01:40:36.007]  What happened?
[01:40:36.007 --> 01:40:38.327]  We had guns when I was a kid.
[01:40:38.327 --> 01:40:42.709]  I went to the school where we had a gun club in the school.
[01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:45.850]  And kids would come with their rifles to school.
[01:40:45.850 --> 01:40:51.152]  And nobody even imagined that somebody would go in that school and start shooting children.
[01:40:51.152 --> 01:40:57.413]  There's other countries that have almost as many guns as we do, like Switzerland, that don't have school shootings.
[01:40:57.413 --> 01:40:58.694]  So what is going on here?
[01:40:58.694 --> 01:41:00.674]  The last school shooting in Switzerland was 21 years ago.
[01:41:02.635 --> 01:41:05.417]  We have school shootings every 21 hours.
[01:41:05.417 --> 01:41:08.699]  One of the things we need to look at are SSRIs.
[01:41:08.699 --> 01:41:20.947]  There is one study that shows that at least 23% of school shootings have the shooter was at the time or prior or before was on SSRIs.
[01:41:25.106 --> 01:41:35.713]  And if you look at the label manufacturing the insert for these drugs, they say on them, homicidal and suicidal ideation and action.
[01:41:38.102 --> 01:41:41.864]  It's not insane to say we should look at this.
[01:41:41.864 --> 01:41:45.386]  Something changed in our country that started this.
[01:41:45.386 --> 01:41:48.167]  And it's not the guns.
[01:41:48.167 --> 01:41:50.268]  Because we've always had the guns.
[01:41:50.268 --> 01:41:51.709]  Something else happened.
[01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:52.850]  And we need to be looking.
[01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:55.451]  And that's the function of NIH.
[01:41:55.451 --> 01:41:58.813]  This is the biggest health threat in our country, these shootings.
[01:41:58.813 --> 01:42:03.255]  NIH is supposed to be doing science that actually looks at the cause.
[01:42:03.255 --> 01:42:06.357]  The problem is it doesn't want to do anything that will
[01:42:07.077 --> 01:42:07.157]  So...
[01:42:36.005 --> 01:42:38.746]  The last month or two, month and a half, I've dropped the ball.
[01:42:38.746 --> 01:42:41.807]  People are like, I don't like RFK Jr.
[01:42:41.807 --> 01:42:43.188]  because he's anti-gun.
[01:42:43.188 --> 01:42:45.669]  And he has been a Democrat.
[01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:49.831]  I'm like, no, no, I've seen a bunch of clips of him saying, we're not taking your guns, not one gun.
[01:42:49.831 --> 01:42:51.071]  The problem is not the guns.
[01:42:51.071 --> 01:42:51.912]  It's crazy, people.
[01:42:51.912 --> 01:42:53.152]  And people are like, I haven't seen that.
[01:42:53.152 --> 01:42:54.973]  Well, there's another clip of it.
[01:42:54.973 --> 01:42:56.293]  But he's even been more specific.
[01:42:56.293 --> 01:42:57.274]  In fact, let's just do that.
[01:42:57.274 --> 01:42:58.294]  Find the clip.
[01:42:58.294 --> 01:43:00.235]  RFK Jr., I'm not going to take one gun.
[01:43:02.196 --> 01:43:03.577]  And that's absolutely true.
[01:43:03.577 --> 01:43:05.438]  So he's on our side.
[01:43:05.438 --> 01:43:09.920]  He was already awake a lot, but I'll be quite honest with you.
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:12.001]  You know, obviously the show helped deprogram him.
[01:43:12.001 --> 01:43:15.823]  And just what the globalists have done helped deprogram him.
[01:43:15.823 --> 01:43:16.363]  They hate him.
[01:43:16.363 --> 01:43:17.484]  That's why they're attacking him.
[01:43:17.484 --> 01:43:19.745]  And he's just injecting truth everywhere.
[01:43:19.745 --> 01:43:21.546]  And he's a great guy.
[01:43:21.546 --> 01:43:23.467]  And Trump has said that too.
[01:43:23.467 --> 01:43:25.508]  Okay, I want to go ahead and take your phone calls.
[01:43:25.508 --> 01:43:29.510]  I've got a lot of other news here, literally over 50 incredible stories like this one.
[01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:33.642]  Supreme Court yesterday overturned affirmative action.
[01:43:33.642 --> 01:43:38.045]  And again, they act like, oh, that's so mean to the black people or whatever.
[01:43:38.045 --> 01:43:42.207]  Ladies and gentlemen, the college degrees are worthless on average.
[01:43:42.207 --> 01:43:43.988]  Let's get that first straight.
[01:43:43.988 --> 01:43:46.690]  I'm not saying you can't get some value, but they're overpriced.
[01:43:46.690 --> 01:43:52.934]  But you can't just say we're going to replace one discriminatory system with another.
[01:43:52.934 --> 01:43:56.056]  That is a good sign of a Supreme Court.
[01:43:56.056 --> 01:43:57.597]  A very, very good sign.
[01:43:57.597 --> 01:43:59.558]  But again, it's not like it's a white dude.
[01:44:01.423 --> 01:44:06.867]  I'm trying to be the police chief, or I'm trying to get the full scholarship.
[01:44:06.867 --> 01:44:11.750]  I don't want to be in the system.
[01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:18.715]  Right now, Chicago always did this thing about police chiefs and promotions or whatever, where it was like the senior people would be the next guy.
[01:44:18.715 --> 01:44:19.936]  Great, have a black police chief.
[01:44:19.936 --> 01:44:20.636]  Sounds wonderful.
[01:44:20.636 --> 01:44:20.997]  I don't care.
[01:44:20.997 --> 01:44:22.238]  As long as they do a good job.
[01:44:22.238 --> 01:44:26.240]  But then they passed over, and there's like no white police chiefs in those areas now, in big cities.
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:27.701]  It's like, well, we just don't have white people.
[01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:34.087]  You don't replace one thing that's wrong with another.
[01:44:34.087 --> 01:44:48.439]  I know that's very, very simple and all of you get that, but it also creates resentment, actually creates the racism that they claim is rampant because it puts people in a racial perspective because you've been, it's, it's happened to you.
[01:44:48.439 --> 01:44:52.462]  And it's just like Biden promising free tuition to everybody, all the rest of it, or reparations.
[01:44:52.462 --> 01:44:54.444]  You're never going to get that.
[01:44:54.444 --> 01:44:56.505]  There's no free lunch, folks.
[01:44:56.505 --> 01:44:57.406]  And stop thinking that.
[01:44:58.530 --> 01:45:03.834]  Oh, you might get something free for a little while, but you're going to pay for it dearly.
[01:45:03.834 --> 01:45:07.176]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls here.
[01:45:07.176 --> 01:45:09.078]  Who has been holding the longest?
[01:45:09.078 --> 01:45:12.080]  I guess they all came in about 16 minutes ago.
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:14.121]  We opened the phone calls up.
[01:45:14.121 --> 01:45:18.945]  So let's just take them in the order they are received here.
[01:45:18.945 --> 01:45:21.807]  Let's go to Obadiah in Vegas.
[01:45:21.807 --> 01:45:24.429]  You're on the air, Obadiah.
[01:45:24.429 --> 01:45:24.849]  What's up, Alex?
[01:45:24.849 --> 01:45:26.150]  What's on your mind?
[01:45:28.854 --> 01:45:35.700]  Okay, so, number one, the pharmaceutical industry is as dirty as can be.
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:41.264]  The Greek word of pharmakia is sorcery, witchcraft, black magic.
[01:45:41.264 --> 01:45:52.974]  And in the Bible, the book of Genesis, the book of Ezekiel, the book of Revelation, all say that the herb is for the healing of all the nations and the leaves are for meat.
[01:45:52.974 --> 01:45:57.238]  So, to you Christians out there, you people professing to be Christians,
[01:45:57.853 --> 01:46:10.682]  Why are you going to these doctors for chemicals that are petrochemical based for whatever ailment that you have when the holy scriptures say the herb is for the healing of all the nations?
[01:46:10.682 --> 01:46:22.390]  Number two, the pharmaceutical industry is responsible for $35 billion in fines and their internal emails come out where they say that they're going to go forward.
[01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:27.474]  A lot of people are going to get hurt by this, but we're going to go forward with it because the profits are going to outweigh the fines.
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:35.222]  So, I hate to be as cold as this is, but if you're still going to these doctors, and even look at that word doctor.
[01:46:35.222 --> 01:46:41.304]  If you told the IRS that you doctored your tax form, what do you think would happen?
[01:46:41.304 --> 01:46:43.585]  Doctor means manipulate.
[01:46:43.585 --> 01:46:51.987]  So, their business model is to get as many people as possible on as many pills as possible for as long as possible.
[01:46:51.987 --> 01:46:53.908]  And they're the third leading cause of death.
[01:46:53.908 --> 01:46:57.329]  Estrogenesis is the third leading cause of death in America.
[01:46:57.935 --> 01:47:00.196]  Medical mistake or misdiagnosis.
[01:47:00.196 --> 01:47:05.419]  So you have a 33% chance of dying if you go to a doctor.
[01:47:05.419 --> 01:47:11.262]  You go to a doctor for the common... They don't even have... They admit to you that they don't even have the cure for the common cold.
[01:47:11.262 --> 01:47:18.606]  So if they admit to you they don't have a cure for the common cold, AIDS, cancer, anything, what do they understand?
[01:47:20.672 --> 01:47:29.337]  Well, I mean, I've always said that doctors on average are good people, but the system that owns them and controls them is predatory and evil and transhumanist.
[01:47:29.337 --> 01:47:35.060]  And so a doctor's great if you've got a gunshot wound or break your leg and they can set it and fix it.
[01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:37.541]  They're wonderful when you've got a rotten tooth.
[01:47:37.541 --> 01:47:40.983]  They're wonderful when you break your nose.
[01:47:40.983 --> 01:47:46.006]  They're, you know, they're wonderful, you know, to do things like that.
[01:47:46.006 --> 01:47:48.207]  But when it comes to all the rest of it, it's pure garbage.
[01:47:49.074 --> 01:47:53.556]  And as the corporations take over the medical system, they become more and more predatory.
[01:47:53.556 --> 01:47:55.477]  Powerful points, Obadiah.
[01:47:55.477 --> 01:47:55.957]  Thank you.
[01:47:55.957 --> 01:48:00.819]  Let's take a call from John.
[01:48:00.819 --> 01:48:03.801]  John is calling from Nebraska, where I'm at right now.
[01:48:03.801 --> 01:48:04.281]  Go ahead, John.
[01:48:04.281 --> 01:48:05.762]  You're on the air.
[01:48:05.762 --> 01:48:09.624]  Alex, I want to thank you for bringing to Omaha the much-needed rain.
[01:48:09.624 --> 01:48:15.326]  It did rain all last night, yeah.
[01:48:15.326 --> 01:48:16.066]  I slept really good.
[01:48:16.066 --> 01:48:17.007]  I've been without a storm.
[01:48:17.921 --> 01:48:24.143]  Yeah, it poured and it's supposed to pour off and on the next several days, so thank you.
[01:48:24.143 --> 01:48:34.546]  Segues to the weather wars, which probably there's been some blocking of the jet stream, which has caused your state to melt from the heat.
[01:48:34.546 --> 01:48:44.910]  Learned all about HAARP and weather manipulation and what have you at a Steve Quayle conference the weekend Princess Diana was murdered, late August 97.
[01:48:46.679 --> 01:48:54.764]  And that brings me to Dr. Len Horowitz, who I think would be a great guest.
[01:48:54.764 --> 01:48:56.605]  Are you there, buddy?
[01:48:56.605 --> 01:48:57.846]  I'm listening.
[01:48:57.846 --> 01:48:59.286]  Okay.
[01:48:59.286 --> 01:49:02.528]  I would love to get a Horowitz song.
[01:49:02.528 --> 01:49:04.169]  I was thinking about Horowitz just like last week.
[01:49:04.169 --> 01:49:05.350]  Where is Horowitz?
[01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:07.191]  He's here all the time.
[01:49:07.191 --> 01:49:08.112]  Yeah, basically.
[01:49:08.112 --> 01:49:13.335]  But anyway, he had quite a program at Steve's conference on A,
[01:49:14.679 --> 01:49:23.321]  And I'm pretty sure he mentioned Dr. Fauci back then in 97 as being a conduit of distribution.
[01:49:23.321 --> 01:49:27.223]  He was involved in the whole thing, yeah.
[01:49:27.223 --> 01:49:29.303]  Oh, and a minute ago you mentioned O.J.
[01:49:29.303 --> 01:49:39.046]  Well, somehow I got in yesterday and talked to Owen, and I was simply mentioning a few guests that you might want to have, and topics, and
[01:49:39.773 --> 01:49:52.298]  I mentioned on Dr. Stan Monteith, years ago, he had a fellow named William Deere, who was a celebrated private investigator, who wrote a book entitled, O.J.
[01:49:52.298 --> 01:49:56.619]  Is Innocent, and I Can Prove It.
[01:49:56.619 --> 01:49:59.800]  I remember that book.
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:01.601]  John in Nebraska, thank you so much, sir.
[01:50:01.601 --> 01:50:03.262]  Thank you for the call.
[01:50:03.262 --> 01:50:06.243]  Let's go to Tim in Seattle on bioweapons.
[01:50:06.243 --> 01:50:06.943]  Tim, you're on the air.
[01:50:06.943 --> 01:50:07.183]  Welcome.
[01:50:08.635 --> 01:50:09.915]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:50:09.915 --> 01:50:11.356]  Amazing broadcast as always.
[01:50:11.356 --> 01:50:15.717]  I'd like to give a plug first for the amazing Red Pill Plus.
[01:50:15.717 --> 01:50:19.778]  That combination, whatever you put in that formulation, is amazing.
[01:50:19.778 --> 01:50:24.639]  My energy level is just through the ceiling already.
[01:50:24.639 --> 01:50:29.200]  I mean, I've lost about 10 pounds and gained about 15 muscle mass.
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:30.521]  It's great stuff.
[01:50:30.521 --> 01:50:32.601]  Thank you for putting that out.
[01:50:32.601 --> 01:50:35.542]  Red Pill was sold out for two plus years because we couldn't get the ingredients.
[01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:39.472]  The lockdowns and I think it's almost sold out or is about to sell out.
[01:50:39.472 --> 01:50:40.372]  Yeah, that's that.
[01:50:40.372 --> 01:50:42.114]  I mean, I'm not hyping any of these products.
[01:50:42.114 --> 01:50:43.435]  They're all amazing.
[01:50:43.435 --> 01:50:46.937]  But a real red pill takes takes a few weeks to kick in.
[01:50:46.937 --> 01:50:50.220]  But once it kicks in, it is just incredible to take it every day for a couple of weeks.
[01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:52.822]  And then you're like, whoa, it's amazing.
[01:50:52.822 --> 01:50:53.442]  Exactly.
[01:50:53.442 --> 01:50:56.225]  It didn't really hit me like I thought it would be like a pep pill.
[01:50:56.225 --> 01:51:01.709]  You know, like if I'm not going to take some coffee with me, I'll just take this real pep pill plus real, real red pill plus.
[01:51:02.242 --> 01:51:03.583]  But it didn't kick in like that.
[01:51:03.583 --> 01:51:08.526]  It waited for like, uh, about four or five days and then I just started feeling this surge.
[01:51:08.526 --> 01:51:09.787]  So it's good stuff.
[01:51:09.787 --> 01:51:13.189]  I hope you can keep it on sale or at least available.
[01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:22.836]  But the bioweapon, uh, everything in our lives is either a chemical weapon or a bioweapon or some sort of psychological warfare weapon aimed against us.
[01:51:22.836 --> 01:51:25.137]  We have to realize that it's a concentration camp.
[01:51:25.137 --> 01:51:26.638]  We are not living in America.
[01:51:26.638 --> 01:51:29.280]  We're living in an occupied nation.
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:30.701]  We have to realize this.
[01:51:30.701 --> 01:51:32.062]  We have to act accordingly.
[01:51:32.662 --> 01:51:33.842]  We have to take to the streets.
[01:51:33.842 --> 01:51:35.703]  We have to be as peaceful as possible.
[01:51:35.703 --> 01:51:46.006]  But yet, just as Professor Desmott said, after six months of silence, once we give up hope in six months, that's when the mass formationists commit atrocities.
[01:51:46.006 --> 01:51:48.007]  And we have to realize that.
[01:51:48.007 --> 01:51:48.687]  No, I totally agree.
[01:51:48.687 --> 01:51:50.648]  We're in a partially occupied country.
[01:51:50.648 --> 01:51:51.708]  They're not in full control.
[01:51:51.708 --> 01:51:53.149]  They're trying to get full control.
[01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:54.469]  But look at Real Red Bill Plus.
[01:51:54.469 --> 01:51:56.170]  It still is in stock, almost sold out.
[01:51:56.170 --> 01:51:59.651]  4.9 star reviews right there.
[01:52:01.428 --> 01:52:03.290]  Everybody should take Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:52:03.290 --> 01:52:05.092]  In fact, it's discounted right now.
[01:52:05.092 --> 01:52:08.715]  It is an amazing, amazing product, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:08.715 --> 01:52:10.657]  And so absolutely, everybody should take it.
[01:52:10.657 --> 01:52:15.862]  It's got natural green tea and urban mate and natural stimulants, so you feel it the first day.
[01:52:15.862 --> 01:52:17.644]  But that's just a little added kick.
[01:52:17.644 --> 01:52:19.145]  That's why it's a plus.
[01:52:19.145 --> 01:52:20.607]  It's the preglanone and the key
[01:52:21.630 --> 01:52:31.276]  Amino acids and stuff that for most people are deficient in preglanone, even though they're young, so it helps your body create hormones to counter all the fake hormones we're being bombarded with.
[01:52:31.276 --> 01:52:34.478]  Everybody needs to get Real Red Pill Plus at InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:52:34.478 --> 01:52:38.701]  It's just as important as Nitric Boost or as the X2 and X3 products.
[01:52:38.701 --> 01:52:40.062]  All of it is in synergy.
[01:52:40.062 --> 01:52:48.948]  When I forget to take them, I just kick myself because they work so well.
[01:52:48.948 --> 01:52:49.408]  Still there, Tim?
[01:52:50.473 --> 01:52:51.314]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!
[01:52:51.314 --> 01:52:53.255]  Sorry, I thought I was going to... Yeah, but you're right.
[01:52:53.255 --> 01:52:54.275]  You're amazingly right.
[01:52:54.275 --> 01:52:59.478]  And I'd also like to give a shout-out to the TMI group that's on Rumble and Discord.
[01:52:59.478 --> 01:53:09.403]  These guys are base info warriors, and if you ever have missed a broadcast, or if you're not quite sure of what's going on, the discussion starts as soon as you guys go off air.
[01:53:09.403 --> 01:53:14.326]  It starts again at 6 o'clock and continues on until we decide to end it, because... Beautiful, brother.
[01:53:14.326 --> 01:53:15.787]  We appreciate you, Tim.
[01:53:15.787 --> 01:53:18.308]  And let's take that little two minutes where he talks about Real Red Bull Plus.
[01:53:18.308 --> 01:53:19.769]  Let's make an ad out of that and run that, because
[01:53:20.971 --> 01:53:23.612]  Again, when I was 40, I went to a medical doctor.
[01:53:23.612 --> 01:53:36.838]  They took like 18 blood tests, and they checked everything, and they said, you've got actually good testosterone at 40 compared to most men, but it's converting to estrogen quickly, and your preglanone's low.
[01:53:36.838 --> 01:53:37.698]  And I said, what's preglanone?
[01:53:37.698 --> 01:53:42.660]  They said, well, they used to give it to everybody for arthritis and everything, but it doesn't make the big companies money.
[01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:46.402]  So they phased it out, and they're trying to control it and ban it, but they haven't been able to yet.
[01:53:46.402 --> 01:53:47.282]  They said, take this.
[01:53:48.228 --> 01:53:50.769]  And that's when I lost all that weight and got all into shape and everything.
[01:53:50.769 --> 01:53:56.152]  So, we put out the formula they had, but souped up, at Infowar store.
[01:53:56.152 --> 01:53:59.734]  And then, for whatever reason, you couldn't get the preglanone.
[01:53:59.734 --> 01:54:01.195]  There's a crappy form and a good form.
[01:54:01.195 --> 01:54:03.196]  We couldn't get the good form for over two years.
[01:54:03.196 --> 01:54:04.297]  Two and a half years sold out.
[01:54:04.297 --> 01:54:05.717]  It's now back in stock.
[01:54:05.717 --> 01:54:06.878]  Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:54:06.878 --> 01:54:07.398]  You need it.
[01:54:07.398 --> 01:54:08.399]  And, you know.
[01:54:09.443 --> 01:54:10.344]  He ordered a bunch of it.
[01:54:10.344 --> 01:54:11.145]  It's almost sold out.
[01:54:11.145 --> 01:54:11.685]  I'm told there's like 2,000.
[01:54:11.685 --> 01:54:13.327]  I just checked when he was talking.
[01:54:13.327 --> 01:54:15.129]  2,000 bottles left.
[01:54:15.129 --> 01:54:16.190]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:54:16.190 --> 01:54:16.830]  Real red pill.
[01:54:16.830 --> 01:54:18.032]  You need to take it.
[01:54:18.032 --> 01:54:20.254]  He said it hit him in like a week.
[01:54:20.254 --> 01:54:21.555]  It's like X2 and X3.
[01:54:21.555 --> 01:54:23.998]  It takes two weeks to hit for me.
[01:54:23.998 --> 01:54:25.599]  And it feels great.
[01:54:25.599 --> 01:54:26.360]  You forget to take it.
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:28.963]  And then, you know, it's like, whoa, what just happened?
[01:54:28.963 --> 01:54:30.224]  You got to take it every day.
[01:54:31.644 --> 01:54:36.207]  And it is powerful, folks, because it's the precursor your body produces that all the hormones are made out of.
[01:54:36.207 --> 01:54:38.088]  You've got to have the preglanone.
[01:54:38.088 --> 01:54:39.569]  And you can buy preglanone for other people if you want.
[01:54:39.569 --> 01:54:40.190]  It's great.
[01:54:40.190 --> 01:54:42.551]  I'm just saying ours is one of the best formulas out there.
[01:54:42.551 --> 01:54:44.252]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:54:44.252 --> 01:54:47.034]  Okay, let's take another caller.
[01:54:47.034 --> 01:54:49.355]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:54:49.355 --> 01:54:51.076]  Let's go to Jason in the great state of Texas.
[01:54:51.076 --> 01:54:51.797]  Jason, you're on the air.
[01:54:51.797 --> 01:54:53.398]  Welcome.
[01:54:53.398 --> 01:54:55.019]  General Jones, how we doing today?
[01:54:56.451 --> 01:54:59.713]  Man, I am blessed, and my father-in-law is doing a lot better.
[01:54:59.713 --> 01:55:04.495]  He was kind of out of it and was almost dead three or four days ago, and he's doing a lot better now.
[01:55:04.495 --> 01:55:05.176]  People bounce back.
[01:55:05.176 --> 01:55:06.836]  I told my wife, pray to God, we prayed a lot.
[01:55:06.836 --> 01:55:08.117]  He's bouncing back.
[01:55:08.117 --> 01:55:10.578]  We're not out of the woods yet, so thank you.
[01:55:10.578 --> 01:55:11.259]  Alrighty.
[01:55:11.259 --> 01:55:20.123]  Let me first start out by saying what a beautiful rendition of our national anthem that young woman sang the other day.
[01:55:20.123 --> 01:55:21.664]  Octavia Wilder.
[01:55:21.664 --> 01:55:23.925]  You should have seen it in person.
[01:55:23.925 --> 01:55:24.706]  Or heard it in person.
[01:55:25.470 --> 01:55:26.891]  It was beautiful.
[01:55:26.891 --> 01:55:47.451]  But like we've been talking about here, and you today and yesterday, the whole goal was to eliminate Republicans and conservatives from this planet so Democrats can hold power forever, which they will, and Texas better get their crap together because illegals outnumber Americans now in Texas.
[01:55:49.813 --> 01:55:50.714]  Well, that's important.
[01:55:50.714 --> 01:55:52.895]  I don't hate the illegal aliens that came here.
[01:55:52.895 --> 01:55:53.656]  They want a better life.
[01:55:53.656 --> 01:55:54.676]  But they're being controlled.
[01:55:54.676 --> 01:55:56.818]  They're being used by the globalists.
[01:55:56.818 --> 01:55:59.159]  And yeah, whites are now the minority in Texas.
[01:55:59.159 --> 01:56:01.361]  I'm so sick of hearing about my white privilege.
[01:56:01.361 --> 01:56:04.683]  I'm so sick of hearing about all this power I have and all this crap.
[01:56:04.683 --> 01:56:05.704]  I don't want to hear about what color.
[01:56:05.704 --> 01:56:08.446]  I want to hear about what I produce and what I stand for, like Martin Luther King said.
[01:56:09.181 --> 01:56:09.401]  Exactly.
[01:56:09.401 --> 01:56:10.182]  It's time to wake up, everybody.
[01:56:37.284 --> 01:56:47.047]  Stand up in the info arc and say, I don't know what's going to go on at the end of all this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[01:56:47.047 --> 01:56:47.587]  Thank you, sir.
[01:56:47.587 --> 01:56:48.947]  We're going to go to break.
[01:56:48.947 --> 01:56:50.808]  Come back with more calls with Patrick Scarles to join us.
[01:56:50.808 --> 01:56:56.189]  But since you asked for it, let's get more Octavia Wilder.
[01:56:56.189 --> 01:56:58.290]  She did a God bless America.
[01:56:58.290 --> 01:57:02.391]  So let's come back with God bless America.
[01:57:02.391 --> 01:57:05.412]  And then I'll talk a few minutes, a little no man's land segment, and when we come back,
[01:57:05.959 --> 01:57:10.120]  Take more calls and have a special guest joining us as well who rides shotgun.
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:12.720]  We're going to air Raymond Sillars.
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:14.701]  Am I pronouncing that right?
[01:57:14.701 --> 01:57:15.641]  Sillars.
[01:57:15.641 --> 01:57:20.702]  Raymond Sillars at the incredible, it really is incredible, River Church in Tampa, Florida.
[01:57:20.702 --> 01:57:22.083]  Revival.com.
[01:57:22.083 --> 01:57:25.443]  I mean, this was like a four hour and a half event.
[01:57:25.443 --> 01:57:27.084]  I've been up since 6 a.m.
[01:57:27.084 --> 01:57:29.604]  and a four hour Sunday service was amazing.
[01:57:29.604 --> 01:57:33.125]  Then I went and did this four plus hour event and it was just wild.
[01:57:34.019 --> 01:57:35.139]  And we still had.
[01:57:35.139 --> 01:57:37.240]  They had 600 people in the little studio they did.
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:39.461]  And a couple thousand outside couldn't get in.
[01:57:39.461 --> 01:57:42.401]  They were in an outside pavilion out there watching some Jumbotron.
[01:57:42.401 --> 01:57:45.202]  And I wanted to go out and shake hands with the end of the band.
[01:57:45.202 --> 01:57:51.544]  I literally, when I got to my hotel, I stumbled and actually... InfoWars is a one-of-a-kind operation.
[01:57:51.544 --> 01:57:55.025]  And so, please, go to InfoWars store and just make a donation.

[01:58:05.402 --> 01:58:09.223]  You can go in and every month or every week, whenever you want, you program it.
[01:58:09.223 --> 01:58:12.184]  You just click it, and then you decide when you want to make a donation.

[01:58:13.265 --> 01:58:18.507]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees, instead of making 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.

[01:58:20.107 --> 01:58:22.188]  The Big July 4 sale is going on right now.

[01:58:24.809 --> 01:58:26.590]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.

[01:58:28.210 --> 01:58:30.311]  But in this major recession going into depression,
[01:58:30.871 --> 01:58:33.293]  And with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[01:58:33.293 --> 01:58:34.234]  I know times are tough.

[01:59:18.456 --> 01:59:19.237]  It boosts men.

[01:59:20.258 --> 01:59:21.018]  It works great.
[01:59:21.018 --> 01:59:22.900]  But women like pink labels.
[01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:24.862]  Men like different color labels.
[01:59:24.862 --> 01:59:26.904]  So it works for men as well.
[01:59:26.904 --> 01:59:27.964]  It's the same formula.
[01:59:27.964 --> 01:59:29.226]  It's an incredible formula.

[02:00:45.107 --> 02:00:46.148]  As we raise

[02:02:56.693 --> 02:02:56.774]  Bye!
[02:03:33.147 --> 02:03:35.268]  Wow, that's a mic dropper!
[02:03:35.268 --> 02:03:36.088]  Woo!
[02:03:36.088 --> 02:03:41.151]  Best part of the night right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:03:41.151 --> 02:03:42.791]  Amazing creature God made right there.
[02:03:42.791 --> 02:03:54.396]  Voice of an angel.
[02:03:54.396 --> 02:04:01.840]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the end of the Civil War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:02.480]  You better believe it!
[02:04:06.144 --> 02:04:15.148]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:04:15.148 --> 02:04:29.595]  You gotta have the will.
[02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:33.637]  Reset the truth and fuck the system and the group collective.
[02:04:33.637 --> 02:04:34.057]  Do that,
[02:04:35.908 --> 02:04:38.722]  And you'll earn your way to the next level.
[02:04:38.722 --> 02:04:39.868]  This is the Info War.
[02:04:58.874 --> 02:05:03.598]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.
[02:05:03.598 --> 02:05:05.559]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[02:05:05.559 --> 02:05:07.601]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[02:05:07.601 --> 02:05:10.083]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[02:05:10.083 --> 02:05:10.903]  Hey, what's better?
[02:05:10.903 --> 02:05:11.744]  Knockout?
[02:05:11.744 --> 02:05:13.085]  What's better?
[02:05:13.085 --> 02:05:13.826]  Down and out?
[02:05:13.826 --> 02:05:14.366]  What's better?
[02:05:14.366 --> 02:05:16.628]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:05:16.628 --> 02:05:21.572]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[02:05:22.245 --> 02:05:26.209]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[02:05:26.209 --> 02:05:27.550]  That's how our bodies work.
[02:05:27.550 --> 02:05:28.851]  They're all very diverse.
[02:05:28.851 --> 02:05:39.040]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.
[02:05:39.781 --> 02:05:45.384]  This is a great formula, full of amazing safe compounds, getting you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep.

[02:06:05.673 --> 02:06:14.295]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:30.061 --> 02:06:30.321]  Yeah.
[02:06:57.145 --> 02:07:08.588]  After seven years of violent revolution, our American founders were well aware that political factions were most often used to divide and conquer the people.
[02:07:08.588 --> 02:07:15.989]  And they knew that the republic they created would only last as long as the people could remain educated.
[02:07:15.989 --> 02:07:25.952]  In 1816, Thomas Jefferson wrote, if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.
[02:07:27.393 --> 02:07:31.986]  By the end of the Civil War, the two-party system became the norm.
[02:07:31.986 --> 02:07:34.853]  The globalist system we face today was born.
[02:07:35.803 --> 02:07:42.947]  And the deliberate dumbing down of the American citizen began with our great-great-grandparents.
[02:07:42.947 --> 02:07:50.571]  In the late 1800s, the Skinner-Pavlovian method was brought into American schools by Johns Hopkins.
[02:07:50.571 --> 02:07:59.576]  These psychological methods allowed teachers the ability to program students' behavior in the same way that Pavlov did with dogs.
[02:08:00.677 --> 02:08:17.437]  In 1934, the Carnegie International Endowment for Peace published the Report on the Commission on Social Studies, which explicitly stated the goal of eventually taking away people's land, and noted that most people would obviously oppose this.
[02:08:18.098 --> 02:08:24.702]  The solution was to begin using the school system to recondition the minds of children.
[02:08:24.702 --> 02:08:41.113]  In 1976, the bicentennial year of the Declaration of Independence, 124 congressmen signed the Declaration of Interdependence, which stated that two centuries ago, our forefathers brought forth a new nation.
[02:08:41.113 --> 02:08:45.216]  Now we must join with others to bring forth a new world order.
[02:08:46.477 --> 02:08:54.144]  And it pledged to give children special attention in distributing a common education to suit their goals.
[02:08:54.144 --> 02:09:05.954]  By the 1990s, this globalist, dumbing-down system was perfected, and America began exporting it worldwide in what is known as outcome-based education.
[02:09:07.195 --> 02:09:12.578]  Starting in 2010, Common Core began in the United States.
[02:09:12.578 --> 02:09:21.383]  It outlined what students were expected to know at each grade level and enforced ways to assess those standards.
[02:09:21.383 --> 02:09:34.550]  Charlotte Isserby, author of The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America, has traced most of this agenda stemming from the Order of Skull and Bones at Yale through both Republicans and Democrats.
[02:09:35.050 --> 02:09:46.596]  Two wings of the same globalist bird, which understood that dumbed-down people have a base desire for a simple dualistic choice.
[02:09:46.596 --> 02:10:02.004]  In 1953, the Rockefeller Foundation funded the Robber's Cave Experiment, wherein 11-year-old boys, who thought they were signing up for summer camp, were organized into two separate tribes and were manipulated into fighting each other.
[02:10:02.524 --> 02:10:08.690]  Which was easily accomplished by having a single resource that the two groups competed for.
[02:10:08.690 --> 02:10:21.241]  The Henry Toshville experiments of the 1970s showed that by simply dividing people into two groups, they would naturally identify with their own group and discriminate against the other.
[02:10:21.241 --> 02:10:25.504]  The basic ego mind is constantly making preferences.
[02:10:25.504 --> 02:10:26.085]  No matter how...
[02:10:27.188 --> 02:10:39.159]  You have an opinion about everything, and if you can keep the population dumb enough and give them two parties to choose from, they will innately identify with one and despise the other.
[02:10:39.159 --> 02:10:51.290]  This allows the globalist system the cover they need to implement unpopular policies, such as a central bank digital currency, while we the people ignorantly fight each other.
[02:10:52.330 --> 02:10:59.213]  United we stand, divided we fall, and we've been falling for it for generations.
[02:10:59.213 --> 02:11:09.117]  The American people have been so thoroughly dumbed down that we think freedom is the ability to choose between two parties working for the same control system.
[02:11:09.117 --> 02:11:17.780]  And we have been made so weak that we are afraid to even discuss the option of violence, which is most often the only remedy for tyranny.
[02:11:18.481 --> 02:11:26.812]  But if we were an enlightened people, we could simply unite together as one and just say no to the tyrants.
[02:11:26.812 --> 02:11:27.793]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:11:27.793 --> 02:11:29.997]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[02:11:38.624 --> 02:11:45.913]  We're now well into the third hour here today, and I want to just say the crew's done a great job while I've been gone for a week and a half.
[02:11:45.913 --> 02:11:47.315]  On the road, it's very stressful.
[02:11:47.315 --> 02:11:54.023]  We have a few technical difficulties, but that special report needed to be seen anyway, so it all works out in the end.
[02:11:54.023 --> 02:11:55.805]  I appreciate the crew putting up with me.
[02:11:55.805 --> 02:11:58.068]  A lot of stressful stuff going up, going on.
[02:11:59.048 --> 02:12:00.288]  Great job of the crew.
[02:12:00.288 --> 02:12:04.710]  Well, I wanted to get Pastor Dave Scarlett back on the show, HisGlory.me.
[02:12:04.710 --> 02:12:07.911]  He reaches millions and millions of people every day with His Glory ministry.
[02:12:07.911 --> 02:12:12.472]  And they felt led by the Lord to move to Texas in the last year to really focus on the border.
[02:12:12.472 --> 02:12:13.493]  So he's been down there a lot.
[02:12:13.493 --> 02:12:14.813]  They've made documentaries.
[02:12:14.813 --> 02:12:16.374]  They've had a bunch of special reports.
[02:12:16.374 --> 02:12:17.314]  They've aired some of those here.
[02:12:17.314 --> 02:12:18.834]  It's incredible footage they've caught.
[02:12:18.834 --> 02:12:21.455]  HisGlory.me is the URL.
[02:12:21.455 --> 02:12:24.796]  But it's great that we got him on this week.
[02:12:24.796 --> 02:12:26.697]  We had an issue a few weeks ago getting him on.
[02:12:27.077 --> 02:12:37.587]  There's some stuff that came up with myself that now you come on and talk about all the latest developments that are coming out.
[02:12:37.587 --> 02:12:43.452]  The congressional reports confirming massive human trafficking, giving children to sex slavers, and
[02:12:44.366 --> 02:12:58.119]  Obama, that's who the third administration of Obama, that's who controls Biden, the old Biden administration, has said that they're not going to test the DNA of children, they're not going to check IDs, whoever has a child, they've got them, they can just disappear.
[02:12:58.119 --> 02:13:00.662]  That is next level criminal.
[02:13:00.662 --> 02:13:07.909]  To make sure these are faceless, soulless, humanist people, in the globalist view, who can be exploited however the new world order wants.
[02:13:08.777 --> 02:13:12.419]  And that ties into this video, and I want to ask Pastor Scarlett about this.
[02:13:12.419 --> 02:13:14.241]  Dave Scarlett, we'll go to him here in just a minute.
[02:13:14.241 --> 02:13:15.741]  This is an InfoWars.com article.
[02:13:15.741 --> 02:13:18.123]  It's obviously a big story.
[02:13:18.123 --> 02:13:21.105]  We know there's a lot of news coming out of Ukraine about
[02:13:21.977 --> 02:13:27.418]  Organ trafficking with the soldiers, the wounded soldiers, the dead soldiers, but also women and children.
[02:13:27.418 --> 02:13:33.540]  Charity worker caught trying to sell baby to organ harvesters in Ukraine after paying the mother $1,000.
[02:13:33.540 --> 02:13:43.902]  The mother believed the child was going to freedom and safety and that he would bring her later to Germany or Poland and said he was about to sell the baby for $25,000 to have its organs harvested.
[02:13:43.902 --> 02:13:45.323]  Now you can say, is this real?
[02:13:45.323 --> 02:13:46.043]  Is this true?
[02:13:46.043 --> 02:13:46.683]  They're saying it is.
[02:13:48.672 --> 02:13:53.796]  They've signed a law in California and Virginia to keep babies alive for 20 plus days and take their organs after they've been born.
[02:13:53.796 --> 02:13:57.498]  Because they can keep them alive now and get more money for every organ.
[02:13:57.498 --> 02:13:59.920]  So yes, this goes on.
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:01.521]  Yes, this is real.
[02:14:01.521 --> 02:14:02.902]  Yes, it's happening.
[02:14:02.902 --> 02:14:05.263]  So here's a quick clip of that.
[02:14:05.263 --> 02:14:07.645]  And then we'll go to Pastor Dave to get his take on it.
[02:14:07.645 --> 02:14:07.925]  Here it is.
[02:14:19.205 --> 02:14:20.686]  I think so.
[02:14:45.643 --> 02:14:57.412]  When was the last time you were here?
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:02.700]  Yesterday.
[02:15:02.700 --> 02:15:07.642]  What did they announce yesterday?
[02:15:07.642 --> 02:15:16.125]  Well, I think that's it.
[02:15:16.125 --> 02:15:29.969]  I didn't give them my email address.
[02:15:44.001 --> 02:15:46.762]  So you can say, oh, that's just more Ukrainian propaganda.
[02:15:46.762 --> 02:15:49.102]  Well, they're not even claiming that the Russians were trying to do this.
[02:15:49.102 --> 02:15:52.983]  They're saying an aid worker, who's an official aid worker, was doing this.
[02:15:52.983 --> 02:15:57.564]  We know that human trafficking is bigger than gambling, bigger than drugs.
[02:15:57.564 --> 02:15:58.704]  It is the commodity.
[02:15:58.704 --> 02:16:01.885]  And naive people that work regular jobs
[02:16:03.584 --> 02:16:14.087]  I don't believe this is happening, but it is going on, and Pastor Dave Scarlett has really been fighting this for a while, and he's been all over the Texas, Arizona, you name it, border.
[02:16:14.087 --> 02:16:14.887]  HisGlory.me.
[02:16:14.887 --> 02:16:15.727]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:16:15.727 --> 02:16:25.230]  Sorry we had a technical difficulty and got you on late, but just your view on this, what's developing, and what's going to happen as the world awakens to what's really happening.
[02:16:26.434 --> 02:16:30.115]  Well, first of all, thank you for having me, Alex, and thank you for standing up for truth.
[02:16:30.115 --> 02:16:33.376]  You've been a pioneer of the truth movement.
[02:16:33.376 --> 02:16:45.518]  What we're seeing, what we saw in Texas and what we saw in Arizona, now with more public information coming out, even from Congress, saying that the United States government is the largest human trafficker out there.
[02:16:45.518 --> 02:16:48.079]  That was a big statement to make about three weeks ago.
[02:16:48.659 --> 02:16:50.481]  We saw that firsthand in Arizona.
[02:16:50.481 --> 02:17:00.970]  We now know that there are nonprofits that are taking money from the United States government and smuggling humans, including children, all through the United States.
[02:17:00.970 --> 02:17:05.314]  And that includes some of the largest church charities as well.
[02:17:05.314 --> 02:17:10.119]  And it is absolutely heartbreaking because this is the worst of the worst when you mess with God's children.
[02:17:14.395 --> 02:17:17.857]  Pastor, you always pause and let me run on, but you've been all over the border.
[02:17:17.857 --> 02:17:18.897]  You've made films on this.
[02:17:18.897 --> 02:17:25.300]  You were doing it before you moved to Texas, but you've been moved to move to Texas for the epicenter of the new UN-sponsored program.
[02:17:25.300 --> 02:17:27.981]  Describe what you've seen and get back into what you just mentioned.
[02:17:27.981 --> 02:17:30.262]  Congress now officially saying, yes, the U.S.
[02:17:30.262 --> 02:17:34.544]  government now is basically running the human trafficking under Joe Biden.
[02:17:35.868 --> 02:17:36.409]  Exactly.
[02:17:36.409 --> 02:17:37.030]  Under O'Biden.
[02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:38.072]  And that's exactly right.
[02:17:38.072 --> 02:17:40.676]  Obama is still the puppet behind Biden.
[02:17:40.676 --> 02:17:42.820]  He's the one making the calls.
[02:17:42.820 --> 02:17:46.847]  And that's shocking just to hear that piece of information by itself that the U.S.
[02:17:46.847 --> 02:17:49.331]  government is the largest trafficker of humans.
[02:17:49.975 --> 02:17:54.519]  And then, again, going deeper into this, we see how they're doing it.
[02:17:54.519 --> 02:17:55.980]  We went down to Arizona.
[02:17:55.980 --> 02:17:59.943]  I spent a day with Sheriff Lamb and Sheriff Daniel's team.
[02:17:59.943 --> 02:18:07.929]  We saw the smuggling coming across, the drugs coming across, the young people that are of military age coming across our border.
[02:18:07.929 --> 02:18:12.392]  And the question you always ask yourself, why would they allow these kids?
[02:18:12.392 --> 02:18:16.976]  And I would say 80% of the kids that I saw at the border were not connected to the family.
[02:18:17.576 --> 02:18:19.577]  They acted like they were part of the family.
[02:18:19.577 --> 02:18:22.358]  They're also a war on religion as well.
[02:18:22.358 --> 02:18:29.601]  What we're finding is when they come to the border, they're taking their rosaries off, making them keep their Bibles there, because they don't, they understand.
[02:18:29.601 --> 02:18:33.983]  I wondered, I asked this question to the sheriffs, why are they making them leave their Bibles behind?
[02:18:33.983 --> 02:18:39.406]  Because they want no evidence of the true faith, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[02:18:39.406 --> 02:18:44.968]  Because that is truly the only light in this world of darkness, as the dark is getting darker and darker before the light.
[02:18:46.371 --> 02:18:53.293]  Well, it's just like all over the world, governments unified under the UN Directive would not let churches open.
[02:18:53.293 --> 02:18:56.675]  I mean, they were arresting just last year.
[02:18:56.675 --> 02:19:00.756]  Even this year, churches in provinces in Canada, they're still arresting.
[02:19:00.756 --> 02:19:05.998]  Churches are still supposed to be closed, but topless bars were open two years ago.
[02:19:05.998 --> 02:19:06.398]  Absolutely.
[02:19:07.455 --> 02:19:10.017]  It's a dark world we live in.
[02:19:10.017 --> 02:19:14.801]  As you saw in your opening, it's a uniparty system that is a cabal system.
[02:19:14.801 --> 02:19:17.363]  And it truly is not Republican or Democrat.
[02:19:17.363 --> 02:19:19.425]  It is light versus dark.
[02:19:19.425 --> 02:19:24.689]  And if we the people don't wake up to the fundamental Constitution of the United States of America that we were established,
[02:19:25.069 --> 02:19:26.070]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:19:53.672 --> 02:19:56.494]  You know, I understand why Israel is there.
[02:19:56.494 --> 02:20:01.238]  I understand that that's where the Jewish people came from, and I'm not an enemy of Israel.
[02:20:01.238 --> 02:20:03.259]  I want Jews to come to Christ.
[02:20:03.259 --> 02:20:04.580]  I think Jews are amazing people.
[02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:23.034]  There's good Jews, there's bad Jews, there's good Germans, there's bad Germans, there's good Japanese, there's bad Japanese, you know, there's good Native Americans, there's bad Native Americans, but there is a big movement, obviously, called Christian Zionism, whatever you want, with Pastor Hagee and many others that, you know, love Shalom and all that, and it's true that
[02:20:24.549 --> 02:20:25.729]  It is Judeo-Christian.
[02:20:25.729 --> 02:20:27.350]  You know, it's the Abrahamic thing.
[02:20:27.350 --> 02:20:28.870]  Old Testament, New Testament.
[02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:29.830]  It comes out of that.
[02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:34.511]  We're so blessed, you know, by that and the blessings that were given to the Jewish people by God.
[02:20:34.511 --> 02:20:48.553]  And it goes back to, you know, back to Noah and Adam and just right through King David and Solomon and, of course, then people like Moses and right through into John the Baptist and Christ.
[02:20:48.553 --> 02:20:49.254]  It's a beautiful thing.
[02:20:49.254 --> 02:20:49.754]  It's a wonderful thing.
[02:20:49.754 --> 02:20:50.494]  I don't deny that.
[02:20:50.494 --> 02:20:51.034]  I'm proud of that.
[02:20:52.392 --> 02:21:01.797]  But, Israel's been cracking down more than ever, just like Saudi Arabia would, on Christians being able to proselytize and teach and preach in Israel.
[02:21:02.543 --> 02:21:02.783]  Absolutely.
[02:21:02.783 --> 02:21:11.673]  And I know Robert L. Brown, a pastor I know, he's been there in the Knesset and said, why are you doing this when Christians give so much money to Israel and do so much for what's happening in Israel?
[02:21:11.673 --> 02:21:22.785]  So there's really a paradoxical view here where a lot of Jews think there's been some issues with the Catholic Church and Jews in the past, which isn't there now, that Christians, just because some Popes in the past were anti-Semitic,
[02:21:24.847 --> 02:21:26.608]  Well, how does that fall onto Protestants?
[02:21:26.608 --> 02:21:28.248]  How does that fall onto you?
[02:21:28.248 --> 02:21:34.311]  Because I understand Israel's key to Revelation, what's going to happen there, abomination, you know, desolation.
[02:21:34.311 --> 02:21:35.991]  You can go to Scripture if you like.
[02:21:35.991 --> 02:21:39.232]  So I want to be friends with the people of Israel.
[02:21:39.232 --> 02:21:41.613]  And I see the people of Israel not getting a free pass on the shots.
[02:21:41.613 --> 02:21:44.775]  They were one of the most oppressed, injected, controlled peoples.
[02:21:44.775 --> 02:21:48.656]  We see them following globalist orders, just like what Americans did.
[02:21:48.656 --> 02:21:50.036]  So I see them just like Americans.
[02:21:50.036 --> 02:21:52.477]  I see them as our brothers, but at the same time,
[02:21:55.191 --> 02:22:06.900]  There's this thing of they'll take the Christian money, but then same time the ADL comes out and says Christians are the main enemy, which we know are leftists, and the ADL wants the Muslims to take over Israel basically.
[02:22:06.900 --> 02:22:09.381]  So it's a really bizarre thing going on.
[02:22:09.381 --> 02:22:13.204]  I kind of did a rant there, but how would you quantify your answer to what I just said?
[02:22:15.126 --> 02:22:22.732]  Civil war going on in Israel, much like what's going on in the United States of America, but maybe even more intense because of the soul of Israel.
[02:22:22.732 --> 02:22:28.476]  As you mentioned, you know, there's the peace of the Israelis that want the Arabs to become part of the government.
[02:22:28.476 --> 02:22:30.237]  They were part of the last government.
[02:22:30.237 --> 02:22:35.001]  And then you have, you've had riots in the streets, literally, in Israel the last month or so.
[02:22:35.001 --> 02:22:40.485]  A lot of that has come from the extreme religious sect of the Orthodox.
[02:22:41.065 --> 02:22:41.906]  Pastor, I'm listening to you.
[02:23:02.785 --> 02:23:07.333]  Right now, sorry, they just had a person walk in here with another thing of coffee at the hotel I'm broadcasting from.
[02:23:07.333 --> 02:23:10.659]  So I was distracted, but you're dead on, continue, because you're so polite.
[02:23:10.659 --> 02:23:12.262]  I'm gonna listen to you, and you stop.
[02:23:12.262 --> 02:23:13.304]  Keep rolling out what's happening.
[02:23:14.494 --> 02:23:17.497]  Yeah, so that's exactly what's happening.
[02:23:17.497 --> 02:23:19.459]  We love biblical Israel.
[02:23:19.459 --> 02:23:20.820]  I always have to stress that.
[02:23:20.820 --> 02:23:22.641]  I'm from the tribe of Judah myself.
[02:23:22.641 --> 02:23:25.224]  I have Jewish blood in me.
[02:23:25.224 --> 02:23:27.926]  But it doesn't mean, as you said, all Jewish people are not good.
[02:23:27.926 --> 02:23:28.927]  All Americans are not good.
[02:23:28.927 --> 02:23:30.288]  All Germans are not good.
[02:23:30.288 --> 02:23:31.429]  It's only the remnant.
[02:23:31.429 --> 02:23:36.314]  And when you see the Bible over and over and over, God is always looking for that remnant.
[02:23:36.314 --> 02:23:39.697]  And that remnant are the ones that stayed true to his precepts and commandments.
[02:23:40.257 --> 02:23:49.365]  And for anybody that's preaching against or telling you that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob wants to kill somebody else, that's not of the Most High God.
[02:23:49.365 --> 02:23:54.409]  And they're taking that religious spirit and they're twisting it like no other time before.
[02:23:54.409 --> 02:23:55.870]  And that's why you literally have riots.
[02:23:55.870 --> 02:24:01.034]  The last time I was on the Temple Mount in February, there was a literal riot on the Temple Mount.
[02:24:01.414 --> 02:24:05.398]  And it wasn't the extreme Muslims that were doing it this time.
[02:24:05.398 --> 02:24:11.685]  It was the extreme Jewish religious sect that were coming against the Christians and coming against the Muslims.
[02:24:11.685 --> 02:24:16.149]  And it's an absolute mess and the only way out of this is truth.
[02:24:16.149 --> 02:24:23.377]  The good news is, my connections in Israel, these Israeli generals and doctors that you know in the United States of America that are Jewish,
[02:24:23.857 --> 02:24:24.177]  We're good.
[02:24:41.102 --> 02:24:44.504]  The real truth is, who is the son of the Most High God?
[02:24:44.504 --> 02:24:47.146]  Who is this Messiah, Yeshua Messiah?
[02:24:47.146 --> 02:24:48.807]  And they're coming in record numbers.
[02:24:48.807 --> 02:24:59.774]  So we're, even though it looks very dark, we're on a tip of light breaking open, and people coming to Christ from places you would never imagine in our lifetime.
[02:24:59.774 --> 02:25:05.698]  The Jewish people, Muslims are coming to Christ with visions and dreams like no other time in the history of the Muslim faith.
[02:25:05.698 --> 02:25:06.639]  It's happening.
[02:25:06.639 --> 02:25:09.581]  So many secular people are having visions of Christ.
[02:25:10.505 --> 02:25:11.347]  I can't say the names.
[02:25:11.347 --> 02:25:12.649]  It's like super prominent people.
[02:25:12.649 --> 02:25:16.456]  And you're right, it's Jews, it's Muslims, it's people that weren't really Christian.
[02:25:16.456 --> 02:25:17.098]  What is happening?
[02:25:18.988 --> 02:25:21.450]  It's the Ezekiel 37.
[02:25:21.450 --> 02:25:22.552]  It's the Great Awakening.
[02:25:22.552 --> 02:25:32.461]  And if this wouldn't have happened the last three and a half years of being locked down, shut down, imprisonment, the corruption of the government, we'd be still asleep at the wheel.
[02:25:32.461 --> 02:25:38.447]  But by the grace of God, He's woke us up to see what is the most important things in our lives.
[02:25:38.447 --> 02:25:40.789]  It's not how high we get up the ladder in the corporate world.
[02:25:41.269 --> 02:25:43.790]  It's what do we do for the gift of Him?
[02:25:43.790 --> 02:25:46.131]  What do we do to accept Him as Lord of our life?
[02:25:46.131 --> 02:25:49.072]  And then once we accept Him, what are you going to do with that gift?
[02:25:49.072 --> 02:25:52.553]  Are you going to bring people in for His purpose and His glory?
[02:25:52.553 --> 02:25:55.614]  And He's opening up people like no other time in history.
[02:25:55.614 --> 02:26:05.938]  We're seeing signs and wonders, miracles, visions and dreams, and the least likely... I've had two imams give their life to Christ in the last year.
[02:26:05.938 --> 02:26:06.238]  Wow!
[02:26:06.238 --> 02:26:07.039]  Tell us about that.
[02:26:07.039 --> 02:26:07.699]  That's fascinating.
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:15.426]  Well, it starts with when you talk to somebody of another faith, and the only way to talk to them is at their level.
[02:26:15.426 --> 02:26:18.790]  So if you're talking to a Jewish person, you have to talk to them from the Old Testament.
[02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:20.972]  Otherwise, they're not going to listen to you.
[02:26:20.972 --> 02:26:22.894]  Same with the Koran.
[02:26:22.894 --> 02:26:29.100]  The Lord had me study the Koran a few years ago, and the reason I studied the Koran is to see where the pieces that fit the Bible
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:49.211]  To plant seeds, and by planting those seeds of the Old Testament, and planting the seeds of what they believe the gospel is being a holy book, you just continue to plant the seeds from the Quran, and then that allows it to blossom, and you pray for them, that the Holy Spirit will shine upon them, that they'll have dreams and visions, and that is exactly what's happening.
[02:26:49.211 --> 02:26:55.674]  One of the Imams, we have like 2.2 million followers on Facebook, gave his life to Christ on Facebook.
[02:26:56.444 --> 02:27:01.615]  And that means instant death, especially for an imam.
[02:27:01.615 --> 02:27:02.237]  Well, that's right.
[02:27:02.237 --> 02:27:03.900]  And people ask why I'm so Christian.
[02:27:05.754 --> 02:27:06.935]  I've had dreams and visions.
[02:27:06.935 --> 02:27:10.017]  I mean, it's happening.
[02:27:10.017 --> 02:27:15.241]  The most intense dreams are unlike any other dreams where I'm with God and I'm being told to do this.
[02:27:15.241 --> 02:27:16.722]  And I know the future.
[02:27:16.722 --> 02:27:19.384]  I mean, all the time, it's like, watch, this is going to happen.
[02:27:19.384 --> 02:27:20.504]  You know this is real.
[02:27:20.504 --> 02:27:22.626]  It's not your brain going through some war game.
[02:27:22.626 --> 02:27:23.366]  Most of your dreams are that.
[02:27:23.366 --> 02:27:26.088]  There's other dreams that are, you know, next level.
[02:27:26.088 --> 02:27:27.029]  And I have these dreams.
[02:27:27.029 --> 02:27:27.850]  I know God's real.
[02:27:27.850 --> 02:27:28.350]  It's incredible.
[02:27:30.012 --> 02:27:37.479]  It's amazing and once you know that he's real and you know that he is sovereign and you know that he's the only way you can get that that true peace in the life and the world.
[02:27:38.129 --> 02:27:39.630]  You're comfortable.
[02:27:39.630 --> 02:27:41.891]  That's one of the things I get asked all the time.
[02:27:41.891 --> 02:27:45.613]  How can the world be melting down, Dave, and you're not worried about it?
[02:27:45.613 --> 02:27:55.077]  Because I know God has it, and I'm just a servant following His direction for His purpose and His glory, and I'm going to finish the race exactly the way the Apostle Paul told us to.
[02:27:55.077 --> 02:27:56.698]  And we've got a lot of souls to win over.
[02:27:56.698 --> 02:27:58.719]  We have a lot of souls to plant the seed.
[02:27:58.719 --> 02:28:03.041]  This is the great harvest that the Scripture talks about, and we are just warming up for this.
[02:28:03.041 --> 02:28:06.023]  So it's time for all Christians to lean in
[02:28:06.604 --> 02:28:09.773]  And spread the gospel from east to west to north to south to every creature.
[02:28:11.579 --> 02:28:16.683]  All right, I want to talk about President Trump, the indictments, the new developments, the Supreme Court rulings with you.
[02:28:16.683 --> 02:28:22.348]  And you're a great guest, and I love watching your show on TV, but you're so nice when you're on my show, you don't really talk.
[02:28:22.348 --> 02:28:23.729]  So I'm like, why have Dave on?
[02:28:23.729 --> 02:28:24.250]  He doesn't talk.
[02:28:24.250 --> 02:28:26.231]  But once you get going, you're one of the best guests.
[02:28:26.231 --> 02:28:27.072]  So I'm glad you're here.
[02:28:27.072 --> 02:28:27.813]  What a smart guy.
[02:28:27.813 --> 02:28:31.055]  I can't wait to talk to Pastor Dave Scarnell on the other side.
[02:28:31.055 --> 02:28:33.177]  Be sure to check out his website and bookmark it.
[02:28:33.177 --> 02:28:35.279]  It's HisGlory.me.
[02:28:35.279 --> 02:28:36.400]  HisGlory.me.
[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:37.040]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:40.343]  We're InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and BandOnVideo.
[02:28:40.743 --> 02:28:41.985]  By the way, I did confirm.
[02:28:41.985 --> 02:28:45.150]  We got 1,200 bottles left of Real Red Pill.
[02:28:45.150 --> 02:28:46.372]  You heard the caller earlier.
[02:28:46.372 --> 02:28:47.374]  They'll sell it in a couple days.
[02:28:47.374 --> 02:28:49.878]  Despite that, they're still discounted.
[02:28:49.878 --> 02:28:51.480]  That funds our operation.
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:51.901]  Stay with us.
[02:28:51.901 --> 02:28:52.281]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:57.853 --> 02:29:02.555]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.
[02:29:02.555 --> 02:29:04.517]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[02:29:04.517 --> 02:29:06.578]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[02:29:06.578 --> 02:29:09.039]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[02:29:09.039 --> 02:29:10.720]  Hey, what's better, knockout?
[02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:12.801]  What's better, down and out?
[02:29:12.801 --> 02:29:13.321]  What's better?
[02:29:13.321 --> 02:29:15.602]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:29:15.602 --> 02:29:20.525]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[02:29:21.221 --> 02:29:25.185]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[02:29:25.185 --> 02:29:26.527]  That's how our bodies work.
[02:29:26.527 --> 02:29:27.828]  They're all very diverse.
[02:29:27.828 --> 02:29:38.019]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love, and sold for a lower price, under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night Sleep.
[02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:44.343]  This is a great formula, full of amazing safe compounds, give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep.
[02:29:44.343 --> 02:29:48.905]  And it's in stock, available right now, of 25% off, out of the gates.

[02:29:57.813 --> 02:30:02.837]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[02:30:02.837 --> 02:30:05.019]  We made it even stronger.
[02:30:05.019 --> 02:30:08.762]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:30:08.762 --> 02:30:14.968]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:30:14.968 --> 02:30:21.733]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:30:21.733 --> 02:30:23.195]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:30:23.815 --> 02:30:36.909]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:30:36.909 --> 02:30:38.891]  It is the super fuel.
[02:30:38.891 --> 02:30:40.373]  RainForce Plus is great.
[02:30:40.373 --> 02:30:41.233]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[02:30:41.233 --> 02:30:42.174]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:30:42.174 --> 02:30:43.376]  They go good with this.
[02:30:43.376 --> 02:30:45.398]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:30:46.115 --> 02:30:47.596]  This is the boss.
[02:30:47.596 --> 02:30:48.336]  TurboForce.
[02:30:48.336 --> 02:30:49.336]  Back in stock.
[02:30:49.336 --> 02:30:50.356]  Discounted.
[02:30:50.356 --> 02:30:52.077]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:30:52.077 --> 02:30:52.957]  More power.
[02:30:52.957 --> 02:30:53.958]  More strength.
[02:30:53.958 --> 02:30:57.579]  More energy.
[02:30:57.579 --> 02:30:58.619]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[02:30:58.619 --> 02:30:59.739]  Do you like RainForce?
[02:30:59.739 --> 02:31:00.260]  Yeah.
[02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:02.280]  So, my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[02:31:02.280 --> 02:31:04.541]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[02:31:04.541 --> 02:31:10.823]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones?
[02:31:10.823 --> 02:31:13.884]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[02:31:14.224 --> 02:31:18.207]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[02:31:18.207 --> 02:31:22.150]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[02:31:22.150 --> 02:31:27.734]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[02:31:27.734 --> 02:31:35.440]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[02:31:35.440 --> 02:31:41.085]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[02:31:41.626 --> 02:31:42.268]  All right, we love you.
[02:31:42.268 --> 02:31:42.869]  We'll be right back.
[02:31:42.869 --> 02:31:47.945]  Get your BrainForce Plus, BrainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfowarStore.com.
[02:31:47.945 --> 02:31:49.008]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[02:31:57.682 --> 02:32:04.346]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[02:32:04.346 --> 02:32:06.267]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[02:32:06.267 --> 02:32:07.768]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[02:32:07.768 --> 02:32:10.569]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[02:32:10.569 --> 02:32:12.571]  And it says political prisoner.
[02:32:13.371 --> 02:32:15.333]  With an image of President Trump.
[02:32:15.333 --> 02:32:17.775]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[02:32:17.775 --> 02:32:19.917]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[02:32:19.917 --> 02:32:26.503]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[02:32:26.503 --> 02:32:27.564]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[02:32:27.564 --> 02:32:31.467]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[02:32:31.667 --> 02:32:33.288]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[02:32:33.288 --> 02:32:34.308]  No, I'm not running for President.
[02:32:34.308 --> 02:32:36.849]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[02:32:36.849 --> 02:32:37.609]  Red, white, and blue.
[02:32:37.609 --> 02:32:38.530]  Alex Jones for President.
[02:32:38.530 --> 02:32:39.470]  $20.24.
[02:32:39.470 --> 02:32:42.051]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[02:32:42.051 --> 02:32:43.931]  Great way to fund the operation.
[02:32:43.931 --> 02:32:53.195]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:59.153 --> 02:33:11.518]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:11.518 --> 02:33:16.060]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.343 --> 02:33:37.626]  I noticed that Antifa has been posting about me being here in Omaha, that I'm vacationing in Omaha.
[02:33:37.626 --> 02:33:42.309]  No, I'm here visiting my mother's father, who's in the hospital after a heart issue.
[02:33:42.309 --> 02:33:44.230]  What'd I say?
[02:33:44.230 --> 02:33:46.031]  You said mother's.
[02:33:46.031 --> 02:33:46.771]  My mother's father.
[02:33:46.771 --> 02:33:47.372]  No, he's dead.
[02:33:47.372 --> 02:33:48.632]  My mother's father's dead.
[02:33:48.632 --> 02:33:50.413]  My wife's father.
[02:33:50.413 --> 02:33:52.474]  Anyways, it's just ridiculous with these people.
[02:33:52.474 --> 02:33:53.775]  That's my wife's father.
[02:33:53.775 --> 02:33:54.395]  My mother's father.
[02:33:54.395 --> 02:33:55.356]  He's been dead for a long time.
[02:33:55.356 --> 02:33:55.776]  Great guy.
[02:33:55.776 --> 02:33:57.337]  That was William Hammond.
[02:33:58.780 --> 02:34:00.501]  But, you know, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:00.501 --> 02:34:04.364]  We've got Pastor Dave Scarlett with us riding shotgun, making some great points.
[02:34:04.364 --> 02:34:07.306]  I was, Sunday night, in a four-hour packed event.
[02:34:07.306 --> 02:34:09.568]  Thousands of people showed up.
[02:34:09.568 --> 02:34:15.492]  And thank goodness they had a big jumbotron outside, and a big outside church for all the thousands that couldn't get in.
[02:34:15.492 --> 02:34:17.493]  And a guy got up, brought up Nick Fuentes.
[02:34:17.493 --> 02:34:22.257]  You know, Nick's a handsome guy, smart guy, intelligent guy.
[02:34:22.257 --> 02:34:26.139]  And he points out there's a war on white people, and that white people are being discriminated against.
[02:34:26.139 --> 02:34:27.440]  And I think it's fine to say that.
[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:28.421]  White folks should stand up.
[02:34:28.976 --> 02:34:30.538]  They're being attacked.
[02:34:30.538 --> 02:34:37.308]  But when him and Kanye West showed up at my studio, and he agreed that Hitler's a good guy, I disagree with that.
[02:34:37.308 --> 02:34:40.773]  Just because there's corruption on the other side doesn't, in my view, mean Hitler's bad.
[02:34:41.673 --> 02:34:54.776]  And then when I pointed out that both my grandfathers were in World War II and one of my grandfathers, after he did his Army Air Corps work, was in Europe and saw the dead bodies and the piles of dead bodies and told my dad about it, didn't really tell me about it.
[02:34:54.776 --> 02:34:56.277]  I heard it directly from my grandfather.
[02:34:56.277 --> 02:35:01.438]  And when I said, well, my grandfather saw it, well, your grandfather's deceived.
[02:35:01.438 --> 02:35:02.358]  Well, that's my grandfather.
[02:35:02.358 --> 02:35:03.919]  That's not taken out of hand.
[02:35:03.919 --> 02:35:08.100]  So this obsession with Hitler 80 years ago and all this is mentally ill.
[02:35:09.162 --> 02:35:11.984]  And so a guy gets up and he says, you've taken down his channel.
[02:35:11.984 --> 02:35:13.346]  So I've made some calls.
[02:35:13.346 --> 02:35:14.547]  I said, is this channel taking off?
[02:35:14.547 --> 02:35:17.009]  And they said, no, he didn't post for a year.
[02:35:17.009 --> 02:35:20.311]  So there's some program where it's basically taken off the front page.
[02:35:20.311 --> 02:35:24.254]  And I'm going to say this, we'll give Nick Flaintest his channel.
[02:35:24.254 --> 02:35:26.976]  He's not doing anything illegal.
[02:35:26.976 --> 02:35:31.460]  And I disagree with what he has to say, but I want Nick to come on the show.
[02:35:31.460 --> 02:35:35.243]  I want Nick to have a debate with me about whatever his issues are with me.
[02:35:35.243 --> 02:35:37.445]  But the guy gets up and we'll go back to Pastor Scarlett.
[02:35:38.536 --> 02:35:49.409]  And he says, Nick Fuentes says, I don't know if this is true, the guy saying it, I guess he said it on the show supposedly, but I don't just take what people say, you know, it's true, I don't know yet.
[02:35:49.409 --> 02:35:53.834]  Says that you said to him, attacking the Jews is a dead end.
[02:35:53.834 --> 02:35:54.996]  Well, I said that on air.
[02:35:54.996 --> 02:35:56.317]  I don't want to attack any group.
[02:35:56.317 --> 02:35:57.519]  I want a big tent for freedom.
[02:35:58.197 --> 02:35:59.538]  They want to divide and conquer us.
[02:35:59.538 --> 02:36:06.584]  We need to unify against the poison shots and the new world order and the human trafficking and the open borders and, you know, the pedophilia and all of it.
[02:36:06.584 --> 02:36:10.066]  I'm like, I don't know if I said that behind the scenes, but I say that on air to him.
[02:36:10.066 --> 02:36:16.431]  So the guy first says, well, you didn't censor him, but you told him not to talk about, no, I didn't tell him not to talk about stuff.
[02:36:16.431 --> 02:36:20.294]  But I do think I probably did say it's a dead end.
[02:36:20.294 --> 02:36:23.236]  Then the guy comes back and says, so you did censor him.
[02:36:23.236 --> 02:36:25.178]  So it's this weirdness that goes on.
[02:36:26.624 --> 02:36:29.946]  But then I started preaching, and talking about what the real problem is.
[02:36:29.946 --> 02:36:35.568]  So, there's this viral clip, and I want to play it here.
[02:36:35.568 --> 02:36:44.252]  I am not going to be divided on the people that call me and say, the black people are the problem, or this is the problem, or the Jews are the problem.
[02:36:44.252 --> 02:36:47.114]  There are good Jews, there are bad Jews, there are good cows, there are bad cows.
[02:36:47.114 --> 02:36:55.198]  My job is to expose the poison shots, and the sex trafficking, and the New World Order, and the nuclear war.
[02:36:55.198 --> 02:36:55.678]  I want
[02:36:56.358 --> 02:36:58.080]  I want the Muslims!
[02:36:58.080 --> 02:36:59.682]  I want the Jews!
[02:36:59.682 --> 02:37:01.784]  I want the Catholics!
[02:37:01.784 --> 02:37:04.066]  I want everybody to find Jesus!
[02:37:04.066 --> 02:37:05.788]  And what I stand for is 100% clear!
[02:37:05.788 --> 02:37:10.332]  That's what I stand for is Jesus Christ!
[02:37:10.332 --> 02:37:13.355]  That's what I stand for!
[02:37:13.355 --> 02:37:15.858]  And I'll debate anybody anytime!
[02:37:15.858 --> 02:37:16.939]  I'd say on the air!
[02:37:26.425 --> 02:37:27.266]  The devil!
[02:37:27.266 --> 02:37:29.488]  And the fact that we haven't accepted Jesus Christ!
[02:37:29.488 --> 02:37:38.275]  Let's go to the next person.
[02:37:38.275 --> 02:37:40.397]  Wow.
[02:37:40.397 --> 02:37:42.779]  I don't know how to follow that.
[02:37:42.779 --> 02:37:44.621]  I had a great time and I'm super exhausted.
[02:37:44.621 --> 02:37:46.883]  Now I have to go five more hours.
[02:37:46.883 --> 02:37:47.363]  Oh my God.
[02:37:47.363 --> 02:37:48.164]  You afraid to debate?
[02:37:48.164 --> 02:37:48.704]  Are you kidding?
[02:37:48.704 --> 02:37:51.667]  I don't wake up until somebody hits me in the head with a baseball bat.
[02:37:51.667 --> 02:37:54.029]  They said nobody would do that with you.
[02:37:54.029 --> 02:37:54.169]  Anyway.
[02:37:55.948 --> 02:37:57.129]  All right, enough of that.
[02:37:57.129 --> 02:38:01.554]  Let's go back to Pastor Dave Scarlett and all the incredible border coverage he's done.
[02:38:01.554 --> 02:38:02.915]  HisGlory.me.
[02:38:02.915 --> 02:38:04.977]  Pastor, I'm always interrupting.
[02:38:04.977 --> 02:38:07.900]  We're going to skip this network break coming up so you have more time.
[02:38:07.900 --> 02:38:16.870]  And I'm going to end this hour with an incredible thing from the River Church in Tampa, Raymond Silliers, where he sings that great song,
[02:38:17.839 --> 02:38:19.261]  I'm proud to be an American.
[02:38:19.261 --> 02:38:21.002]  That's in about 15-20 minutes.
[02:38:21.002 --> 02:38:21.923]  You've got the floor.
[02:38:21.923 --> 02:38:23.745]  Preach us a little sermon here right now.
[02:38:23.745 --> 02:38:25.167]  I'm going to turn my mic off.
[02:38:25.167 --> 02:38:26.889]  I'm going to sit back.
[02:38:26.889 --> 02:38:30.653]  I'm going to listen to you.
[02:38:30.653 --> 02:38:32.575]  For the next 27 minutes, we're live on air.
[02:38:32.575 --> 02:38:34.136]  So I'll come back in the last three or four.
[02:38:34.136 --> 02:38:39.382]  You've got the floor to tell us about where the world is today and what you think is about to happen and what you think we should do.
[02:38:40.737 --> 02:38:43.719]  Well, it starts, Alex, with what you just said at the River Church.
[02:38:43.719 --> 02:38:46.201]  It's truly that the enemy is the devil.
[02:38:46.201 --> 02:38:48.063]  This is the light versus dark.
[02:38:48.063 --> 02:38:49.404]  There's no ifs, ands, or buts.
[02:38:49.404 --> 02:38:51.706]  And the evil wants it to divide.
[02:38:51.706 --> 02:38:55.849]  Remember the scripture tells us, if Satan's against himself, his house will divide.
[02:38:55.849 --> 02:38:57.030]  That wasn't a figure of speech.
[02:38:57.030 --> 02:38:58.191]  It truly is.
[02:38:58.191 --> 02:39:02.274]  Satan's house is against his house, and it will divide, and it will collapse.
[02:39:02.274 --> 02:39:04.416]  The only truth is the living Word of God.
[02:39:04.816 --> 02:39:15.381]  And that's why we have to get rid of our little minor differences because you're looking for the church to be a museum for saints instead of a hospital for sinners.
[02:39:15.381 --> 02:39:16.442]  We're all sinners.
[02:39:16.442 --> 02:39:18.223]  We're all work in progress.
[02:39:18.223 --> 02:39:19.483]  And we need the blood of the Lamb.
[02:39:19.483 --> 02:39:24.266]  We need the blood of Jesus Christ to come into our heart, our soul, and our mind and save us for eternity.
[02:39:24.266 --> 02:39:25.507]  That's the only way.
[02:39:25.507 --> 02:39:28.368]  And the only way is to be united for His namesake.
[02:39:28.368 --> 02:39:31.089]  As you said, there are some good Jews, there are some bad Jews.
[02:39:31.089 --> 02:39:32.890]  There's good Americans and bad Americans.
[02:39:32.890 --> 02:39:34.131]  Good Germans and bad Germans.
[02:39:34.691 --> 02:39:37.432]  But the only good, as Jesus said, who is good?
[02:39:37.432 --> 02:39:42.512]  Even Jesus, when He walked the earth, couldn't even say He was good until He took it to the cross.
[02:39:42.512 --> 02:39:43.853]  We're not good.
[02:39:43.853 --> 02:39:50.194]  And the only way to be good is to get the blood of the Lamb to come in and be our Savior of the world.
[02:39:50.194 --> 02:39:55.575]  And this is a time, like no other time in the history of the world, where there are panicking right now.
[02:39:55.575 --> 02:39:57.975]  Satan knows his time is about up.
[02:39:57.975 --> 02:40:01.376]  So he's throwing everything he possibly can at us.
[02:40:01.376 --> 02:40:03.696]  Division, warfare of all kinds.
[02:40:04.296 --> 02:40:06.097]  And you know, some of the church are falling for that.
[02:40:06.097 --> 02:40:08.018]  Some of the religious spirit are falling for that.
[02:40:08.018 --> 02:40:10.259]  Some that are on the fence are falling for that.
[02:40:10.259 --> 02:40:12.601]  And they're starting to bicker over little things.
[02:40:12.601 --> 02:40:14.181]  We have to get rid of that bickering.
[02:40:14.181 --> 02:40:15.902]  We have to get rid of the fence.
[02:40:15.902 --> 02:40:17.563]  Satan owns the fence.
[02:40:17.563 --> 02:40:20.965]  As Jesus said to the church of Laodicea, you're neither hot nor cold.
[02:40:20.965 --> 02:40:21.745]  You're lukewarm.
[02:40:21.745 --> 02:40:22.846]  I vomit you out of my mouth.
[02:40:23.346 --> 02:40:27.310]  The seventh of the church age is the church of Laodicea.
[02:40:27.310 --> 02:40:29.712]  That's the church we're at in today.
[02:40:29.712 --> 02:40:32.355]  And there's no better time to see where we're at.
[02:40:32.355 --> 02:40:40.223]  When you see in the scripture, in the book of Revelation, in the church of Laodicea, Jesus Christ is at the door of the church, knocking in to get to the church.
[02:40:40.223 --> 02:40:44.587]  This church age is taking Jesus completely out of His church, His body.
[02:40:45.007 --> 02:40:49.732]  So what you're seeing around the world, the Lord, in the last three and a half years, is testing the remnant.
[02:40:49.732 --> 02:40:51.233]  Will the remnant stand up?
[02:40:51.233 --> 02:40:55.297]  When they try to come shut you down, are you going to fold and conform like the rest of the government?
[02:40:55.297 --> 02:40:58.680]  Are you going to do what the government tells you, or are you going to do what I tell you to do?
[02:40:58.680 --> 02:40:59.681]  And he says, fear not!
[02:41:00.942 --> 02:41:03.904]  Most High God, and I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[02:41:03.904 --> 02:41:08.566]  And if you put your trust in me, you have complete shalom and peace for eternity.
[02:41:08.566 --> 02:41:11.627]  There is no other peace on the world that you can get.
[02:41:11.627 --> 02:41:16.050]  No drug, no alcohol, nothing can fill that gap.
[02:41:16.050 --> 02:41:21.032]  That hole that each and every one of us are born with because of the fall of Adam and Eve.
[02:41:21.032 --> 02:41:24.454]  And the only way to fill that is through the love of Jesus Christ.
[02:41:24.454 --> 02:41:25.935]  That's what they don't want to hear.
[02:41:25.935 --> 02:41:28.776]  That's why everything you hear today is hate, hate, hate.
[02:41:29.338 --> 02:41:31.801]  What the world needs is love, love, love.
[02:41:31.801 --> 02:41:34.864]  We need to put our arms around this transgender generation.
[02:41:34.864 --> 02:41:36.445]  They're confused, they're manipulated.
[02:41:36.445 --> 02:41:38.167]  Look, no time in history.
[02:41:38.167 --> 02:41:49.659]  When you get to a point in human history where you see companies like Disney, you see human trafficking, you see the child sacrifices that are happening in the world today, and they're putting it in your face.
[02:41:49.659 --> 02:41:52.322]  We are in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah and worse.
[02:41:52.942 --> 02:41:55.344]  But that is telling you they're manipulating the child.
[02:41:55.344 --> 02:41:57.006]  Satan hates the child.
[02:41:57.006 --> 02:41:58.888]  And that's why he's going after the child.
[02:41:58.888 --> 02:42:05.694]  Satan's number one thing he wanted to do when he fell from heaven was to attack mankind.
[02:42:05.694 --> 02:42:08.317]  Because God did something amazing in the book of Genesis.
[02:42:08.317 --> 02:42:09.318]  He created us!
[02:42:10.100 --> 02:42:10.981]  In His image.
[02:42:10.981 --> 02:42:14.123]  We're the only creation in the image of the Most High God.
[02:42:14.123 --> 02:42:15.123]  Doesn't mean we're perfect.
[02:42:15.123 --> 02:42:19.346]  The only way we can become perfect is through the blood of the Lamb when He takes us home.
[02:42:19.346 --> 02:42:20.347]  But Satan knew that.
[02:42:20.347 --> 02:42:22.728]  He knew that the division was going to be it.
[02:42:22.728 --> 02:42:26.611]  And he knew that the Lord, the Father, huge heart for the children.
[02:42:26.611 --> 02:42:28.232]  So what's happening in the world today?
[02:42:28.232 --> 02:42:29.413]  Attacking the children.
[02:42:29.413 --> 02:42:31.054]  That's right out of Satan's playbook.
[02:42:31.494 --> 02:42:39.218]  And it's time for the great flip, the great boomerang, the great light, the light to shine down from east to west and north to south.
[02:42:39.218 --> 02:42:41.499]  It's about over and Satan knows it.
[02:42:41.499 --> 02:42:45.781]  We're going to have the greatest revival in the history of the world because people are waking up and saying, you know what?
[02:42:45.781 --> 02:42:49.063]  Over the course of this last three and a half years, I've been lied to.
[02:42:49.063 --> 02:42:49.943]  I've been manipulated.
[02:42:49.943 --> 02:42:51.344]  I've been forced to take jabs.
[02:42:51.344 --> 02:42:53.825]  I've been forced to do things against my free will.
[02:42:53.825 --> 02:42:55.306]  I've been forced not to see loved ones.
[02:42:55.306 --> 02:42:56.267]  I've had loved ones die.
[02:42:57.768 --> 02:42:59.292]  The border is out of control.
[02:42:59.292 --> 02:43:03.922]  We have a person in the office, a president that's not even supposed to be there.
[02:43:03.922 --> 02:43:05.005]  What else could happen?
[02:43:05.498 --> 02:43:11.080]  And that's the way God is reaching you today and saying, you see all the things that have happened in the last three and a half years?
[02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:16.381]  What's it going to take for you to reach out your hand to me, my child, and say, you're the only way.
[02:43:16.381 --> 02:43:18.702]  You're the only way.
[02:43:18.702 --> 02:43:23.924]  I am the only way, meaning God the Father through the Son is the only way to bring peace to this world.
[02:43:23.924 --> 02:43:31.526]  And once you do that, once you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as Lord of your life, you've just entered into eternity with the Most High God.
[02:43:31.526 --> 02:43:33.086]  Now the question is, what are you going to do with it?
[02:43:33.086 --> 02:43:34.627]  What are you going to do with that free gift?
[02:43:35.107 --> 02:43:38.072]  Are you going to walk the walk and talk the talk of the Lord?
[02:43:38.072 --> 02:43:40.716]  Are you going to be a part of His remnant?
[02:43:40.716 --> 02:43:43.279]  Are you going to be a part of His purpose for your life?
[02:43:43.279 --> 02:43:49.849]  Because each and every person watching this today, if you accepted Jesus Christ as Lord of your life, God has a purpose for you.
[02:43:50.269 --> 02:43:52.192]  Are you going to activate that purpose?
[02:43:52.192 --> 02:43:53.934]  Or are you part of the fence?
[02:43:53.934 --> 02:43:55.595]  Remember, the fence has to go.
[02:43:55.595 --> 02:43:58.319]  You're either all in or you're all out.
[02:43:58.319 --> 02:43:59.920]  There's no middle ground.
[02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:02.343]  And we're seeing that in the last three and a half years.
[02:44:02.343 --> 02:44:03.484]  And the Lord is using it.
[02:44:03.484 --> 02:44:06.348]  He's turning things up through visions and dreams.
[02:44:06.348 --> 02:44:10.472]  If you haven't had a supernatural experience with the Lord, you need to ask Him to come into your heart today.
[02:44:11.437 --> 02:44:12.758]  Muslims are doing it.
[02:44:12.758 --> 02:44:14.159]  Jewish people are doing it.
[02:44:14.159 --> 02:44:21.383]  People who are non-believers of any other god are asking the question, if you truly are the Son of God, show yourself.
[02:44:21.383 --> 02:44:22.904]  And we're seeing it in Great Revival.
[02:44:22.904 --> 02:44:24.685]  We're seeing it in Great Miracles.
[02:44:24.685 --> 02:44:27.007]  Exactly the way the scripture told us was going to happen.
[02:44:27.407 --> 02:44:34.894]  So there will be great outpouring in the end days, even more than the times when Jesus walked the shores of Galilee, and that we're in that spot.
[02:44:34.894 --> 02:44:38.537]  The question is, are you going to be activated for His purpose and His glory?
[02:44:38.537 --> 02:44:42.480]  We're taking tent revivals because the Lord told me to take them to all 50 states.
[02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:45.863]  We just came back from Quarryville, Pennsylvania, and the rain came down.
[02:44:45.863 --> 02:44:47.164]  Satan didn't want us to have this event.
[02:44:47.164 --> 02:44:49.066]  The rain came down, the sun came up.
[02:44:49.526 --> 02:44:53.968]  There was a shekinah glory that came over the crowd that was priceless.
[02:44:53.968 --> 02:45:00.391]  And one of the people in the audience asked, Lord, show you Mark, show the true rainbow over this event.
[02:45:00.391 --> 02:45:05.054]  And as we were coming out of the tent, there was a perfect rainbow sitting right over the tent.
[02:45:05.054 --> 02:45:10.537]  That's God showing him, showing us that he is the way, the truth, and the life, and there's no other way.
[02:45:10.537 --> 02:45:13.018]  He is the great I am that I am.
[02:45:13.018 --> 02:45:16.359]  And you just have to ask him to come into your heart today.
[02:45:16.359 --> 02:45:17.260]  If you are a Christian,
[02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:19.401]  That needs to be reactivated.
[02:45:19.401 --> 02:45:23.665]  Or if you're somebody that's been on the fence and don't know the Lord, ask Him this simple question.
[02:45:23.665 --> 02:45:25.226]  Lord, I'm a sinner.
[02:45:25.226 --> 02:45:26.487]  I repent.
[02:45:26.487 --> 02:45:27.288]  I need You.
[02:45:27.288 --> 02:45:29.589]  I need You to become Commander-in-Chief of my life.
[02:45:29.589 --> 02:45:35.334]  And if you pray that prayer, and you spoke that, and you truly meant that, you are now activated for His Kingdom.
[02:45:35.334 --> 02:45:38.917]  You are activated to become a warrior for His purpose and His glory.
[02:45:38.917 --> 02:45:41.759]  Now you've got to ask Him, what do you want me to do?
[02:45:42.279 --> 02:45:46.420]  Like the prophet Isaiah said, here I am Lord, here I am, use me, use me!
[02:45:46.420 --> 02:45:50.422]  We need more Isaiah's today that are willing to be servants to the Most High God.
[02:45:50.422 --> 02:46:03.086]  It's not about glamour, it's not about money, it's not about fame, it's all about giving Him the glory and being humble servants and putting Him first and let Him glorify it from east to west to north to south.
[02:46:03.086 --> 02:46:06.927]  We're on the brink of the greatest revival in the history of the world.
[02:46:07.467 --> 02:46:08.567]  This is history.
[02:46:08.567 --> 02:46:15.428]  Even the prophets of old, the disciples of Jesus, would love to be where we're at at this moment in time.
[02:46:15.428 --> 02:46:17.629]  The question is going to be, what are you going to do with it?
[02:46:17.629 --> 02:46:19.569]  Are you going to be a part of this great revival?
[02:46:19.569 --> 02:46:24.930]  Are you going to be a part of glorifying our King of Kings and Lord of Hosts from east to west and north to south?
[02:46:24.930 --> 02:46:26.510]  Or are you going to stay on the fence?
[02:46:26.510 --> 02:46:28.111]  It's time to get active.
[02:46:28.111 --> 02:46:29.631]  It's time to take a move.
[02:46:29.631 --> 02:46:33.732]  It's time to step up and be a part of His purpose and His glory.
[02:46:33.732 --> 02:46:34.552]  And once you do,
[02:46:35.092 --> 02:46:35.793]  We're good to go!
[02:46:56.505 --> 02:46:59.927]  It's a love relationship in the heart, not a religion.
[02:46:59.927 --> 02:47:05.331]  If you're doing religion, you're doing it wrong, and that's where we've been taught wrong in all world religions.
[02:47:05.331 --> 02:47:08.152]  You've got to do this, you've got to do that, you've got to do the other.
[02:47:08.152 --> 02:47:11.815]  No, the Most High God wanted to have a love relationship with us.
[02:47:11.815 --> 02:47:16.758]  He picked us, and He chose us before the beginning of time, as the prophet Jeremiah tells us.
[02:47:16.758 --> 02:47:20.560]  He knew us before we were in our mother's womb, and for such a time as this.
[02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:21.401]  But the question is,
[02:47:21.981 --> 02:47:24.706]  Will you be activated for His purpose and His glory?
[02:47:24.706 --> 02:47:28.071]  Will you say, Yes, Lord, You are the Lord of my life.
[02:47:28.071 --> 02:47:31.657]  I say, God can't do three things.
[02:47:31.657 --> 02:47:33.399]  And people shake their heads when you hear this.
[02:47:33.399 --> 02:47:34.481]  God can't do three things.
[02:47:34.481 --> 02:47:37.025]  One, He can't learn because He's all-knowing.
[02:47:37.774 --> 02:47:39.455]  Number two, he can't sin.
[02:47:39.455 --> 02:47:42.617]  His words and his precepts and commandments are perfect.
[02:47:42.617 --> 02:47:44.538]  He can't go against his word.
[02:47:44.538 --> 02:47:46.419]  That's so important to know.
[02:47:46.419 --> 02:47:49.221]  You have a God that can't go against his precepts and commandments.
[02:47:49.221 --> 02:47:53.944]  So when you know him and his word, you know he can't go against those precepts and commandments.
[02:47:53.944 --> 02:47:56.005]  And the third is why we're here.
[02:47:56.005 --> 02:47:59.147]  He can't make you love him.
[02:47:59.147 --> 02:48:05.551]  Are you going to choose today for him to become commander-in-chief in the heart for a love relationship for eternity?
[02:48:06.425 --> 02:48:07.766]  Tomorrow is never given.
[02:48:07.766 --> 02:48:11.607]  Satan's favorite day of the week is tomorrow, because tomorrow may never come.
[02:48:11.607 --> 02:48:14.468]  Are you going to do it for his purpose and his glory today?
[02:48:14.468 --> 02:48:19.890]  Take action today for the glory of God and be activated for his namesake.
[02:48:19.890 --> 02:48:22.151]  We pray that.
[02:48:22.151 --> 02:48:23.131]  Wow.
[02:48:23.131 --> 02:48:27.513]  Pastor, Pastor Dave Scarlow just knocked it out of the park.
[02:48:27.513 --> 02:48:30.394]  We just need to let you be a guest host, so I'm not there to interrupt you.
[02:48:30.394 --> 02:48:32.055]  That was amazing.
[02:48:32.055 --> 02:48:33.415]  That was powerful.
[02:48:33.415 --> 02:48:35.516]  We've got about nine minutes till we end this hour.
[02:48:36.690 --> 02:48:43.713]  When the great guest host is going to be taken over here today, the amazing Drew Hernandez.
[02:48:43.713 --> 02:48:47.074]  But what else is on your radar screen, Pastor?
[02:48:47.074 --> 02:48:50.676]  Well, again, the tent revivals are so important to do.
[02:48:50.676 --> 02:48:53.557]  We're traveling to all 50 states to do tent revivals.
[02:48:53.557 --> 02:48:56.538]  We just came out of Quarryville, Pennsylvania, and the glory of God showed up.
[02:48:57.296 --> 02:49:07.041]  We've baptized, I think, over 6,000 people at reawaken events and our trips to Israel and also these tent revivals.
[02:49:07.041 --> 02:49:12.123]  This is the time that God is calling His people to come into these tent revivals, the old-fashioned tent revival.
[02:49:12.623 --> 02:49:21.409]  It's not about fame, it's not about fortune, it's about getting in a tent and taking the glory of God and let the glory of God come down and let Him shine His glory.
[02:49:21.409 --> 02:49:25.411]  And we're seeing that in just supernatural ways and it's absolutely amazing.
[02:49:25.411 --> 02:49:26.332]  And we're going to continue that.
[02:49:26.332 --> 02:49:31.195]  Our next one is in New Hampshire in September the 16th, so join us on that.
[02:49:31.195 --> 02:49:34.097]  Then we'll be back in Mount Pleasant, Texas, our ranch in Texas.
[02:49:34.837 --> 02:49:58.349]  October 21st and then we go we have a VIP tour we're going to go to Israel to show the Holy Land to show where the places are of the Bible and the Bible will come alive for you once you've gone to Israel and you see biblical Israel I want to stress biblical Israel the promises of the Bible that God gave to Abraham Isaac and Jacob and the Gentiles who can be grafted in because of the divine and
[02:49:59.249 --> 02:50:00.590]  Your whole heart changes.
[02:50:00.590 --> 02:50:03.232]  Your whole Bible studies change.
[02:50:03.232 --> 02:50:07.656]  We'll be joined on the VIP tour at the King David with General Flynn.
[02:50:07.656 --> 02:50:10.358]  It'll be an incredible time to see the glory of God.
[02:50:10.358 --> 02:50:15.482]  It'll be a great time to see all the biblical events that are in our Bible.
[02:50:15.482 --> 02:50:17.683]  And we do three trips a year.
[02:50:17.683 --> 02:50:20.805]  And every time we come back, people are on fire for the Lord.
[02:50:20.805 --> 02:50:24.648]  They want to have more and more experiences in their Bible.
[02:50:24.648 --> 02:50:25.249]  And that's the key.
[02:50:25.809 --> 02:50:28.110]  You know, you can turn fake news off today.
[02:50:28.110 --> 02:50:31.710]  The only truth in this world of fake news is the Living Word of God.
[02:50:31.710 --> 02:50:32.871]  He cannot lie.
[02:50:32.871 --> 02:50:36.912]  He tells you what tomorrow is going to be before the news even knows what tomorrow is going to be.
[02:50:36.912 --> 02:50:38.892]  And we put our trust in Him.
[02:50:38.892 --> 02:50:41.873]  27.5% of the Bible is Bible prophecy.
[02:50:41.873 --> 02:50:46.414]  He's telling us things thousands of years before they happen, and they're happening in our lifetime.
[02:50:46.414 --> 02:50:50.134]  The supernatural miracles that we're seeing in the last 70 seconds.
[02:50:50.134 --> 02:50:50.975]  That was my next question.
[02:50:54.133 --> 02:51:03.723]  Literally, Revelation, Daniel, Ezekiel, Old Testament to Testament, predicts it to a T. The world government, the capital society, the social credit score.
[02:51:03.723 --> 02:51:06.145]  It's not just you agree to take a mark now you can buy and sell.
[02:51:06.145 --> 02:51:09.128]  You have to worship the beast, do everything it says.
[02:51:09.128 --> 02:51:11.370]  It watches you in live time, describes it all.
[02:51:11.370 --> 02:51:13.893]  It's the social credit score.
[02:51:13.893 --> 02:51:14.854]  It's all right there.
[02:51:14.854 --> 02:51:15.975]  I mean, it's happening.
[02:51:17.370 --> 02:51:21.993]  Exactly, and you see what the whistleblower is coming for with the two whistleblowers with the IRS.
[02:51:21.993 --> 02:51:27.137]  The IRS scandal that's going to come out on top of that just fits into that credit score.
[02:51:27.137 --> 02:51:34.222]  And when you have the IRS stopping, or a credit score stopping you, whether you can go to a grocery store and make a purchase.
[02:51:34.222 --> 02:51:38.445]  You know, these are things that we didn't, you know, you talked about 20, 30 years ago.
[02:51:38.445 --> 02:51:39.425]  That is today.
[02:51:39.425 --> 02:51:45.330]  It is on the brink, never in our history of the Bible has these events been right before our very eyes.
[02:51:46.110 --> 02:51:55.018]  People have to wake up now, because there is no tomorrow if you're not alive today in Jesus Christ, because these events are not on the doorstep.
[02:51:55.018 --> 02:51:56.719]  They are here.
[02:51:56.719 --> 02:52:02.804]  If you haven't got that in the last three and a half years, welcome to the last three and a half years, because it's been awakening.
[02:52:02.804 --> 02:52:04.005]  You're going to fall through.
[02:52:04.005 --> 02:52:12.152]  You need to look back on this and you say, how could this Antichrist fella fool the entire world that everybody would just drop everything they're doing and follow him?
[02:52:12.592 --> 02:52:13.953]  Well, little is he by increments.
[02:52:13.953 --> 02:52:21.677]  He gets you to accept lies, two men can have a baby, all this, and then we're going to put this in your body, and pretty soon you totally collapse.
[02:52:21.677 --> 02:52:23.438]  All right, HisGlory.me.
[02:52:23.438 --> 02:52:25.219]  Pastor Scarlett, best interview yet with you.
[02:52:25.219 --> 02:52:25.860]  Thank you so much.
[02:52:25.860 --> 02:52:26.620]  Great job.
[02:52:26.620 --> 02:52:31.043]  You can find all your documentaries and reports on the border and more at HisGlory.me.
[02:52:31.043 --> 02:52:36.246]  Here it is, California governor getting ready to sign the law to take children from parents and we'll let them mutilate them.
[02:52:36.246 --> 02:52:37.747]  I mean, we have fallen so far.
[02:52:37.747 --> 02:52:40.788]  Let's admit it and realize we can only get out of this with God.
[02:52:40.788 --> 02:52:41.589]  Thank you so much, Pastor.
[02:52:42.563 --> 02:52:43.263]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:52:43.263 --> 02:52:43.683]  Take care.
[02:52:43.683 --> 02:52:45.204]  God bless you.
[02:52:45.204 --> 02:52:45.604]  Thank you.
[02:52:45.604 --> 02:52:47.205]  Drew Hernandez takes over next hour.
[02:52:47.205 --> 02:52:55.908]  I've got a few more things I want to say, and I'll be back tomorrow live, full Friday show here, and then I'll be back in Texas soon for the Monday show.
[02:52:55.908 --> 02:53:03.531]  I'm going to do the Sunday show, everything here, but I'm back Monday morning, so I'll be on the show then.

[02:53:06.732 --> 02:53:08.933]  It's only you that gets past the censors, so it's in your hands.
[02:53:08.933 --> 02:53:09.673]  We're fighting hard.
[02:53:09.673 --> 02:53:10.654]  I appreciate you.
[02:53:10.654 --> 02:53:11.234]  I'm in your hands.
[02:53:11.234 --> 02:53:11.714]  You're in my hands.

[02:53:32.205 --> 02:53:36.948]  It's an ongoing, long battle, but submission to tyranny is, you know, far worse than continuing to fight.
[02:53:36.948 --> 02:53:41.532]  In fact, it's invigorating, it's empowering to fight, so I'm very, very thankful, but I ask everybody during the
[02:53:42.088 --> 02:53:44.409]  July 4th, Super Sale to visit InfoWare Store.

[02:54:22.047 --> 02:54:27.950]  We'll end with, I'm proud to be an American, and then the great Drew Hernandez takes over, and the amazing Owen Schroyer.
[02:54:27.950 --> 02:54:28.290]  Stay with us.
[02:54:42.270 --> 02:55:08.595]  If tomorrow all the things were gone I worked for all my life And I had to start again With just my children and my wife I thank my loving Lord To be living here today Cause the flag still stands for freedom And they can't take that away
[02:55:16.767 --> 02:55:17.708]  I think so.
[02:55:49.507 --> 02:56:12.932]  From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee, across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea, Detroit down to Houston, New York
[02:56:15.583 --> 02:56:31.473]  There's pride in every American heart And it's time to stand and say That I'm proud to be an American Where at least I know I'm free
[02:56:32.543 --> 02:56:53.220]  I won't forget the man who died Who gave that right to me And I'll bear this shame Next to you and defend us till today Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land God bless the USA
[02:57:00.105 --> 02:57:06.434]  Oh, I'm proud to be an American where at least I know it's free.

[02:58:23.465 --> 02:58:25.447]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[02:58:25.447 --> 02:58:26.847]  People are listening more than ever.
[02:58:26.847 --> 02:58:28.969]  But in this major recession going into depression,

[02:58:41.596 --> 02:58:44.838]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[02:58:44.838 --> 02:58:46.519]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

[02:59:10.381 --> 02:59:11.701]  Only a few hundred bottles left.
[02:59:11.701 --> 02:59:17.084]  But the good news is we have several thousand bottles left of Super Female Vitality that's the same formula.
[02:59:17.084 --> 02:59:17.884]  It boosts men.
[02:59:17.884 --> 02:59:18.885]  It boosts women.
[02:59:18.885 --> 02:59:19.665]  It works great.
[02:59:19.665 --> 02:59:21.526]  But women like pink labels.
[02:59:21.526 --> 02:59:23.507]  Men like different color labels.
[02:59:23.507 --> 02:59:25.528]  So it works for men as well.
[02:59:25.528 --> 02:59:26.589]  It's the same formula.
[02:59:26.589 --> 02:59:27.850]  It's an incredible formula.

[02:59:50.843 --> 02:59:54.785]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:03.444 --> 03:00:07.926]  What is going on, Baystock Criminals and Info Warriors worldwide?
[03:00:07.926 --> 03:00:17.810]  You are now watching the fourth hour of the most infamous band transmission on the face of planet Earth, arguably the universe, the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:17.810 --> 03:00:18.930]  My name is Jude Hernandez.
[03:00:18.930 --> 03:00:20.811]  I am your guest host.
[03:00:20.811 --> 03:00:24.393]  A lot of news, guys, a lot of news going on today, especially
[03:00:25.820 --> 03:00:35.843]  On the stage of the New World Order and the stage nationally here in the United States of America, their plans are constantly and consistently moving forward, never holding back.
[03:00:35.843 --> 03:00:38.564]  They'll take their L's every now and then.
[03:00:38.564 --> 03:00:40.505]  We'll thwart their plans every now and then.
[03:00:40.505 --> 03:00:48.907]  But you gotta understand, when it comes to this anti-Christ spirit and the push for the world government, cashless society, the devil never sleeps.
[03:00:48.907 --> 03:00:51.048]  These demonic powers never sleep.
[03:00:51.843 --> 03:00:57.085]  They'll take their L's, but then they'll re-strategize, and they'll come back ten times harder.
[03:00:57.085 --> 03:01:07.069]  Just like Jesus said, when a spirit's removed from a human, they clean shop and they come back with seven more, more evil than itself, and it's even worse than it was before.
[03:01:07.069 --> 03:01:08.289]  Does it mean that we're black-pilled?
[03:01:08.289 --> 03:01:09.470]  Does it mean that we give up?
[03:01:09.470 --> 03:01:12.091]  Does it mean that God is not more powerful?
[03:01:12.091 --> 03:01:17.573]  Does it mean that it's just totally useless to be fighting this righteous war, good versus evil?
[03:01:17.573 --> 03:01:20.394]  What it means is that we do not, we do not get complacent.
[03:01:21.368 --> 03:01:35.111]  We do not allow ourselves to get into this mindset where, well we could just take a break, well we could just kind of like let our foot off the gas for a little bit because we got a W, it looks like they're retreating, but we know when they retreat...
[03:01:35.808 --> 03:01:40.170]  It's a strategic retreat and they will come back 10 times harder.
[03:01:40.170 --> 03:01:46.634]  That's why we can never get complacent and why we could never let our foot off the gas.
[03:01:46.634 --> 03:01:49.895]  That is why it's imperative to support Infowars.com.
[03:01:49.895 --> 03:01:50.536]  It's important.
[03:01:50.536 --> 03:01:53.277]  It's imperative to support free speech systems.
[03:01:53.277 --> 03:01:58.540]  These people are never sleeping, constantly attempting to strategize how to dismantle
[03:01:59.252 --> 03:02:07.597]  This apparatus that God has given us to actually distribute real information, true information inside of the InfoWar.
[03:02:07.597 --> 03:02:10.018]  So make sure to go to the InfoWarStore.com right now.
[03:02:10.018 --> 03:02:12.160]  Get engaged with real economic warfare.
[03:02:12.160 --> 03:02:13.640]  That's one way you could do it.
[03:02:13.640 --> 03:02:22.125]  If you obviously cannot be on air speaking your voice, speaking the truth in the face of the New World Order, then you could support it as well.
[03:02:22.125 --> 03:02:26.108]  Buy some InfoWar bonds right now by going to the store and getting the great products.
[03:02:26.108 --> 03:02:26.228]  Guys,
[03:02:26.588 --> 03:02:29.370]  It's just, this is the reality of the world that we live in.
[03:02:29.370 --> 03:02:46.921]  When you're facing multi-billionaires, when you're facing these corporations and these entities that are fully, fully engaged, fully engaged with economic warfare to dismantle the West, dismantle the United States of America, control demolition, they are 9-11ing, alright?
[03:02:48.246 --> 03:02:52.727]  What they did at 9-11 is what they are literally doing to the United States economy right now.
[03:02:52.727 --> 03:02:54.788]  That's what the great reset is.
[03:02:54.788 --> 03:02:56.608]  Controlled demolitions.
[03:02:56.608 --> 03:02:58.049]  Great reset.
[03:02:58.049 --> 03:02:59.809]  Build back better.
[03:02:59.809 --> 03:03:15.434]  You see the... Joe Biden yesterday, I know Owen covered it extensively yesterday, but man, dude, you look... You look at the puppet president, Joe Biden, they're rolling him out fresh out of bed with
[03:03:16.703 --> 03:03:19.406]  The strap marks on his cheeks still.
[03:03:19.406 --> 03:03:22.028]  It's like, man, he's literally just a shell.
[03:03:22.028 --> 03:03:30.415]  He's literally just a puppet, and they're rolling a body out, calling it the President of the United States, but we all know what this is.
[03:03:30.415 --> 03:03:38.842]  It is just a puppet that is functioning, being told where to walk, being told what to say, read this on the teleprompter.
[03:03:38.842 --> 03:03:39.743]  He can't even do that!
[03:03:39.743 --> 03:03:44.487]  He can barely read the globalist New World Order messages off the teleprompters, right?
[03:03:45.137 --> 03:03:57.379]  But that's the ideal candidate for the New World Order is an empty shell whose brain is nothing but a smoothie.
[03:03:57.379 --> 03:04:02.540]  Lights are on when nobody's home, you know, and they want you to feel sorry for these people.
[03:04:02.540 --> 03:04:04.600]  They want you to feel sorry for Joe Biden.
[03:04:04.600 --> 03:04:05.881]  He's just an old man.
[03:04:05.881 --> 03:04:06.401]  Look at him.
[03:04:06.401 --> 03:04:07.421]  He's so frail.
[03:04:07.421 --> 03:04:08.901]  Oh, he would never hurt a fly.
[03:04:08.901 --> 03:04:10.041]  Yeah, right.
[03:04:10.041 --> 03:04:13.022]  Just go ask Ashley Biden how she feels about pervert Joe.
[03:04:14.475 --> 03:04:17.138]  Uh, you know, but that's the whole agenda, right?
[03:04:17.138 --> 03:04:20.482]  They're pushing all of these pawns and agents of the New World Order.
[03:04:20.482 --> 03:04:24.267]  They want you to feel sorry for them if they can't speak correctly.
[03:04:24.267 --> 03:04:25.628]  They're just empty shells.
[03:04:25.628 --> 03:04:28.812]  John Fetterneck, he had multiple strokes.
[03:04:28.812 --> 03:04:30.354]  Oh, just feel sorry for him.
[03:04:30.974 --> 03:04:34.096]  They just need those puppets so they can continue to push these agendas.
[03:04:34.096 --> 03:04:37.017]  That's why he's rolling out with the whole Bidenonomics.
[03:04:37.017 --> 03:04:41.379]  Whatever the hell that means, it's just literally crapping down the American people's mouths.
[03:04:41.379 --> 03:04:42.940]  The economy's in shambles.
[03:04:42.940 --> 03:04:44.281]  Controlled demolition.
[03:04:44.281 --> 03:04:45.481]  Great reset.
[03:04:45.481 --> 03:04:46.402]  Build back better?
[03:04:46.402 --> 03:04:55.106]  I think not, but the only way to build back better, not in the case of make America great again, but in the case of the global New World Order, you need a great reset.
[03:04:55.106 --> 03:04:57.187]  We'll get into all that when we get back, so stay with us.
[03:04:58.757 --> 03:05:02.400]  Have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[03:05:02.400 --> 03:05:04.983]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[03:05:04.983 --> 03:05:06.464]  So let me get this straight.
[03:05:06.464 --> 03:05:25.921]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the Obama administration, Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son, Hunter, to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption, an event that Donald Trump looked into, sparking the first impeachment, enforcing the arming of Ukraine, in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia,
[03:05:26.221 --> 03:05:52.518]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had, but that they swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign, all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents, despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016, when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[03:05:52.518 --> 03:05:53.719]  Do I have that all straight?
[03:06:02.592 --> 03:06:03.593]  All right, guys.
[03:06:03.593 --> 03:06:09.556]  Like I said, they are going 100 miles an hour with their New World Order agendas.
[03:06:09.556 --> 03:06:11.817]  They have no intentions of holding back.
[03:06:11.817 --> 03:06:13.998]  They'll re-strategize.
[03:06:13.998 --> 03:06:15.158]  They'll pull back.
[03:06:15.158 --> 03:06:16.559]  They'll regroup.
[03:06:16.559 --> 03:06:18.080]  And then they'll launch their next ones.
[03:06:18.080 --> 03:06:24.823]  That's why there's Agenda 21, Agenda 25, Agenda 30, Agenda 50, you name it.
[03:06:24.823 --> 03:06:27.305]  These people got plans for the next 100 years.
[03:06:28.687 --> 03:06:36.453]  And when you pay close attention to how they break down their plans, they're always inconsistently talking about the future.
[03:06:36.453 --> 03:06:42.959]  There's a reason why Klaus Schwab gets up, Davos 2023, World Government Summit 23.
[03:06:42.959 --> 03:06:53.047]  There's a reason why they get up and they make statements like those who control, or those who master, that's essentially what he's saying, control, those who master the technologies of the future,
[03:06:54.500 --> 03:06:56.321]  They will literally be masters of the future.
[03:06:56.321 --> 03:06:58.221]  They'll be masters of the universe.
[03:06:58.221 --> 03:07:01.302]  They'll be masters of everything going into the future.
[03:07:01.302 --> 03:07:02.423]  And why do they say that?
[03:07:02.423 --> 03:07:12.326]  They say that because not only do they want to play God, they want to be God, but they want to ascend above the one and only true God.
[03:07:12.326 --> 03:07:16.167]  That's the heart of the global New World Order.
[03:07:16.167 --> 03:07:17.828]  It's not just world domination.
[03:07:17.828 --> 03:07:22.149]  Yes, that's the end game that we see in the Bible, but
[03:07:22.808 --> 03:07:28.532]  The absolute heartbeat, the thrust of what drives these people to do what they do.
[03:07:28.532 --> 03:07:30.114]  They want world domination.
[03:07:30.114 --> 03:07:31.455]  They want control.
[03:07:31.455 --> 03:07:37.199]  But at the epicenter of this entire thing, what these people want is they want to be God.
[03:07:37.199 --> 03:07:39.961]  They want to ascend above God.
[03:07:39.961 --> 03:07:44.604]  And by doing so, they want to remove God and push God out of the picture.
[03:07:44.604 --> 03:07:45.946]  And obviously that won't happen.
[03:07:45.946 --> 03:07:47.527]  Obviously that cannot happen.
[03:07:47.527 --> 03:07:50.389]  But that is what it means to be anti-Christ.
[03:07:51.118 --> 03:07:55.780]  The spirit of the Antichrist that the Bible says has been deployed into planet Earth.
[03:07:55.780 --> 03:08:00.122]  It's already been out there for the past few thousand years.
[03:08:00.122 --> 03:08:08.887]  And the Apostle John says, the Antichrist, the one and only, the Antichrist will rise eventually.
[03:08:08.887 --> 03:08:12.068]  And we're seeing the infrastructure is all there, guys.
[03:08:12.068 --> 03:08:19.672]  The cashless society, the one world government, the one world religion, one world economic system, one world militarized system.
[03:08:20.467 --> 03:08:21.247]  It's all there.
[03:08:21.247 --> 03:08:23.068]  It's all being prepared.
[03:08:23.068 --> 03:08:27.390]  The infrastructure digitally, I could say the technology is definitely there.
[03:08:27.390 --> 03:08:32.992]  Theologians have always asked, how in the world could the Mark of the Beast be implemented?
[03:08:32.992 --> 03:08:44.036]  We understand that anyone can come out and put some kind of mark or put some kind of decree, like the Nazis threw the Star of David patch on the Jews to identify who's who, right?
[03:08:46.351 --> 03:08:59.741]  But theologians, how would they accurately worldwide be able to monitor, surveil, and uphold something so advanced?
[03:08:59.741 --> 03:09:09.629]  And I think now, if you live post-Neuralink, you live now post-AI, you live now post the rocket age, the industrial age, here we are!
[03:09:09.629 --> 03:09:14.112]  Anyone that has been around for the past, I would say and argue maybe 70 years,
[03:09:15.652 --> 03:09:19.675]  Would be able to answer that question like that?
[03:09:19.675 --> 03:09:21.837]  I mean, really, realistically think about it, right?
[03:09:21.837 --> 03:09:29.622]  I was a youth pastor for six years, and when I would talk about this to Gen Z, and they're like, what?
[03:09:29.622 --> 03:09:30.803]  Whoa!
[03:09:30.803 --> 03:09:35.867]  We could definitely see a Mark of the Beast happening like that, because this generation knows technology!
[03:09:37.303 --> 03:09:38.704]  You go talk to Gen Z right now.
[03:09:38.704 --> 03:09:43.588]  These kids understand how easy a Mark of the Beast could be implemented like that.
[03:09:43.588 --> 03:09:57.820]  I mean, if you weren't around in 2020 and the COVID lockdown, CCP, the way that Xi Jinping gets down, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, they all praise China for how they surveil the surveillance state, big brother, the social credit scores, monitoring everybody's behavior.
[03:09:57.820 --> 03:10:02.984]  If you're a good citizen of the New World Order, then you are allowed to function in society.
[03:10:02.984 --> 03:10:05.146]  It's all here, guys.
[03:10:05.146 --> 03:10:06.327]  The infrastructure exists.
[03:10:07.503 --> 03:10:13.066]  And not just the infrastructure technologically when it comes to the New World Order, but also the mindset.
[03:10:13.066 --> 03:10:16.067]  Also the mindset has been primed.
[03:10:16.067 --> 03:10:17.228]  Cultures.
[03:10:17.228 --> 03:10:18.829]  Not just one country.
[03:10:18.829 --> 03:10:20.470]  Not just five countries.
[03:10:20.470 --> 03:10:22.090]  Worldwide post-2020.
[03:10:22.090 --> 03:10:27.073]  We saw the entire world bend the knee to an agenda.
[03:10:27.073 --> 03:10:30.735]  To multiple federal governments locking down their citizens.
[03:10:31.718 --> 03:10:43.264]  Big Brother telling the entire world, non-elected entities, World Health Organization, Dr. Fauci's, you name it, Dr. Birx, all these deep state plants, all these New World Order plants, right?
[03:10:43.264 --> 03:10:55.289]  UN, EU, all colluding together, World Economic Forum, all of their proxies that come out, all prescribing what the federal government should do for the United States of America.
[03:10:57.282 --> 03:11:01.283]  You see Dr. Fauci, 14 days to stop the spread.
[03:11:01.283 --> 03:11:02.763]  They get in there in the Trump White House.
[03:11:02.763 --> 03:11:04.724]  They're directing the Trump White House what to do.
[03:11:04.724 --> 03:11:06.244]  Operation Warp Speed, you name it.
[03:11:06.244 --> 03:11:14.586]  These unelected bureaucrats that get in, that are New World Order, and they influence policy in countries, especially the United States of America.
[03:11:14.586 --> 03:11:25.929]  You see, but the point I'm trying to get to is, not only are we ready, and what I mean by ready, I'm not saying the Christian, I'm saying just a culture, a people, a civilization, not just the United States of America.
[03:11:26.733 --> 03:11:34.399]  The mind has been primed to accept worldwide tyranny, not just a nationalistic tyranny, right?
[03:11:34.399 --> 03:11:42.705]  What communism, totalitarianism is, the Fidel Castro's, the Mao's, the Stalin's, it's all like this national communism, right?
[03:11:42.705 --> 03:11:44.046]  Be a good commie.
[03:11:44.046 --> 03:11:45.206]  Be a good citizen of your country.
[03:11:45.206 --> 03:11:48.689]  The Nazis, it's all this nationalistic fascism, communism.
[03:11:48.689 --> 03:11:53.572]  Okay, but what we're dealing with and what I noticed post 2020 was this worldwide
[03:11:56.880 --> 03:12:02.444]  This worldwide, that's everything we saw was stay home, save lives.
[03:12:02.444 --> 03:12:06.326]  Just get jabbed, you're gonna save lives, you're gonna be a good citizen of the world.
[03:12:06.326 --> 03:12:07.927]  Good citizen of the world!
[03:12:07.927 --> 03:12:10.889]  You're gonna save the world if you get jabbed 10 times.
[03:12:10.889 --> 03:12:13.871]  You're gonna save the world if you just stay home and stay locked down.
[03:12:13.871 --> 03:12:15.432]  This is a pandemic!
[03:12:15.432 --> 03:12:23.697]  This is a chaotic scenario, doomsday, you have to stay home, and in order to be a good citizen, stay home.
[03:12:23.697 --> 03:12:25.278]  Stay home, save lives.
[03:12:26.306 --> 03:12:27.427]  Sacrifice your freedom.
[03:12:27.427 --> 03:12:27.867]  We saw this.
[03:12:27.867 --> 03:12:29.988]  The mainstream media was all in on it.
[03:12:29.988 --> 03:12:31.789]  The mainstream corporate media.
[03:12:31.789 --> 03:12:33.570]  The New World Order.
[03:12:33.570 --> 03:12:38.694]  All these proxies in the medical industry, in the health industry.
[03:12:38.694 --> 03:12:40.415]  They all had the same message.
[03:12:40.415 --> 03:12:51.561]  The same unified message that was coming down from the UN, the EU, these bureaucrats in the World Health Organization that nobody elected that have been influencing policy for the USA.
[03:12:51.561 --> 03:12:52.282]  And by the way,
[03:12:53.106 --> 03:13:00.354]  They're already embracing for the next stage of this, the next phase of this, that they'll open up the United States of America.
[03:13:00.354 --> 03:13:04.218]  We'll just, we'll just, you know, we'll just hand over the reins to the United Nations.
[03:13:04.218 --> 03:13:14.709]  Because if this ever happens again, we saw how the Infowarriors, we saw how the Freedom Movement, we saw how patriots that would not let go of their freedoms to save their countrymen,
[03:13:15.469 --> 03:13:17.890]  And then you had the mask formation, Colt.
[03:13:17.890 --> 03:13:18.750]  You guys remember this?
[03:13:18.750 --> 03:13:25.672]  People running around the streets, all the left-leaning NPCs, all these woke-tard morons running around saying, you know, screw your freedoms, man!
[03:13:25.672 --> 03:13:27.112]  Screw your freedoms to save lives!
[03:13:27.112 --> 03:13:32.993]  You're like Jimmy Kimmel, all the late-night TV shows, Stephen Colbert, screw your freedoms, man!
[03:13:32.993 --> 03:13:34.174]  We gotta save people!
[03:13:34.174 --> 03:13:36.094]  It's like this total virtue signal, right?
[03:13:37.498 --> 03:13:47.729]  I guess psychologically, that's why the InfoWars is so important to be engaged in and having your mind unlocked, plugged out of the Matrix, because when the Matrix starts to
[03:13:49.201 --> 03:13:53.906]  You know, upload their latest downloads for the NPCs and... I mean, that's what the Matrix is, right?
[03:13:53.906 --> 03:14:07.260]  The Matrix is essentially a simulated environment, a simulated reality that's supposed to get the mind to believe that what they're seeing, what they're hearing, what they're touching, what they're feeling, what they're engaging with and interfacing with is actually real.
[03:14:08.348 --> 03:14:09.589]  And we live in this, guys.
[03:14:09.589 --> 03:14:13.433]  We live in a multi-dimensional universe, multi-dimensional world.
[03:14:13.433 --> 03:14:18.778]  We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against powers, principalities, spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.
[03:14:18.778 --> 03:14:20.279]  We engage, we interface.
[03:14:20.279 --> 03:14:22.922]  If you're a born-again Christian, you interface with the Holy Spirit.
[03:14:22.922 --> 03:14:25.084]  If you're a child of the devil, you interface with the world.
[03:14:25.084 --> 03:14:29.388]  You interface, that's all run by the devil, or you interface with demons, the New World Order, the occult.
[03:14:29.388 --> 03:14:30.529]  They're all involved with this.
[03:14:30.529 --> 03:14:33.972]  Every single day, we're going back and forth, and it's only going to stop.
[03:14:34.744 --> 03:14:40.885]  When Christ returns, and that's the war, that's the endgame that we're all going towards right now.
[03:14:40.885 --> 03:14:46.867]  What I'm saying is, your mind is so valuable to Satan and the New World Order.
[03:14:46.867 --> 03:14:48.867]  They know how powerful your mind is.
[03:14:48.867 --> 03:14:58.330]  Why do you think that even in Davos 23, you had globalists up there literally talking about an information war?
[03:14:58.330 --> 03:15:00.030]  They literally sounded like you and me.
[03:15:00.874 --> 03:15:13.724]  You guys, they literally sounded like Alex Jones, Owen Troyer, Harrison Smith, talking about the info war that we are all engaged in, how powerful it is to understand, how imperative it is to have accurate and true information.
[03:15:13.724 --> 03:15:18.028]  And when I say that, I'm not talking about like how, you know, the FBI says it or Google says it.
[03:15:18.028 --> 03:15:20.369]  Oh, misinformation, disinformation.
[03:15:20.369 --> 03:15:21.951]  We got to make sure that we are upholding the truth.
[03:15:21.951 --> 03:15:23.452]  Rachel Maddow, lesbian,
[03:15:26.739 --> 03:15:31.991]  We're not going to air Trump speaking after the indictment because he's misinformation.
[03:15:31.991 --> 03:15:33.695]  We have to make sure we're reporting the truth.
[03:15:34.628 --> 03:15:38.889]  What I'm saying, guys, is there is literally a war for your psyche.
[03:15:38.889 --> 03:15:41.049]  There's literally a war for your conscience.
[03:15:41.049 --> 03:15:43.090]  There's literally a war for your mind.
[03:15:43.090 --> 03:15:51.092]  And the other side is fully engaged, fully engaged, fully aware, win their mind, rule their mind, manipulate their mind, propagate their mind.
[03:15:51.092 --> 03:15:55.693]  And if we do that successfully, we will rule their entire lives.
[03:15:55.693 --> 03:15:56.233]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:57.099 --> 03:15:59.802]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[03:15:59.802 --> 03:16:04.686]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[03:16:04.686 --> 03:16:09.992]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[03:16:09.992 --> 03:16:18.099]  That's why I ask listeners, respectfully, to go to infowarestore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at
[03:16:18.660 --> 03:16:19.000]  I think?

[03:17:01.581 --> 03:17:06.803]  Two new incredible products are now available explicitly at infowarestore.com.
[03:17:06.803 --> 03:17:19.168]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical-slash-supplement maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[03:17:19.168 --> 03:17:22.329]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[03:17:23.149 --> 03:17:36.096]  Both of these have known, documented natural compounds to lower pain and also make your nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[03:17:36.096 --> 03:17:38.477]  There's major research behind this all.
[03:17:38.477 --> 03:17:42.539]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWarsMD and Nerve

[03:17:57.355 --> 03:18:05.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globals, in their own words, plan for our future.
[03:18:05.560 --> 03:18:07.021]  That is a hellish future.
[03:18:07.021 --> 03:18:16.426]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or infowareshore.com.
[03:18:16.426 --> 03:18:22.030]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:18:22.030 --> 03:18:23.991]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:18:24.591 --> 03:18:29.975]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHore.com.
[03:18:29.975 --> 03:18:33.917]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:18:33.917 --> 03:18:39.801]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:18:39.801 --> 03:18:41.883]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[03:18:42.683 --> 03:18:43.723]  Or unsigned copies.
[03:18:43.723 --> 03:18:54.087]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshaw.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[03:18:54.087 --> 03:18:55.127]  This is an Infowar.
[03:18:55.127 --> 03:18:57.328]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[03:18:57.328 --> 03:19:03.470]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[03:19:04.230 --> 03:19:13.213]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:19:13.213 --> 03:19:16.074]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:19:16.074 --> 03:19:19.375]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:19:19.375 --> 03:19:27.357]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:19:27.877 --> 03:19:32.701]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[03:19:32.701 --> 03:19:44.230]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:19:44.230 --> 03:19:50.295]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[03:19:50.295 --> 03:19:56.460]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:58.263 --> 03:20:02.885]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:02.885 --> 03:20:11.949]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:11.949 --> 03:20:15.771]  And you are back on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:15.771 --> 03:20:17.572]  I'm your guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[03:20:17.572 --> 03:20:20.733]  I want to invite you guys to go subscribe to my Rumble channel.
[03:20:21.733 --> 03:20:25.795]  Watch Drew Hernandez live Monday through Friday at 7 p.m.
[03:20:25.795 --> 03:20:26.335]  Pacific.
[03:20:26.335 --> 03:20:27.296]  That's 10 p.m.
[03:20:27.296 --> 03:20:28.156]  Eastern Standard.
[03:20:28.156 --> 03:20:29.857]  We'd get based over there, guys.
[03:20:29.857 --> 03:20:38.802]  Also, follow me on Twitter at Drew H. Live, and you can click the link in my bio to find all of the other great shows and content that I put on.
[03:20:38.802 --> 03:20:40.702]  Guys, the point I'm trying to make is this, all right?
[03:20:40.702 --> 03:20:47.926]  The point I'm trying to make is, technologically, the entire world has the infrastructure ready for the Mark of the Beast.
[03:20:47.926 --> 03:20:48.646]  All right?
[03:20:48.646 --> 03:20:49.507]  The entire world
[03:20:50.450 --> 03:20:58.075]  Has the infrastructure and the technology to take the world to the next level into that becoming a reality.
[03:20:58.075 --> 03:20:59.576]  It's already a reality right now.
[03:20:59.576 --> 03:21:01.877]  The scripture has already foretold this.
[03:21:01.877 --> 03:21:05.620]  But as time catches up, so does technology.
[03:21:05.620 --> 03:21:17.868]  As we go further down the timeline, all right, as we go further down the timeline in the current timeline that we find ourselves in right now,
[03:21:19.278 --> 03:21:21.359]  Things begin to come to fruition.
[03:21:21.359 --> 03:21:22.339]  That's eschatology.
[03:21:22.339 --> 03:21:23.439]  That's Bible prophecy.
[03:21:23.439 --> 03:21:25.480]  God has already ordained all of this.
[03:21:25.480 --> 03:21:27.220]  He's already foretold all of this.
[03:21:27.220 --> 03:21:31.821]  He's shown us just exactly how the global New World Order is going to be developing.
[03:21:31.821 --> 03:21:33.802]  And the epicenter will be Israel, by the way.
[03:21:33.802 --> 03:21:48.025]  One of the things that the Apostle Paul, who's a Jew, a super Jew, by the way, one of the things that the Apostle Paul broke down very clearly in an eschological manner was that there will be a third Jewish temple
[03:21:49.401 --> 03:21:58.208]  That will be around in this scenario when the Antichrist is finally revealed because he says that he will enter into the temple, the Jewish temple.
[03:21:58.208 --> 03:21:59.349]  That's in Israel right now.
[03:21:59.349 --> 03:22:09.056]  He will sit down in the Holy of Holies and he will declare himself to be God and to be worshipped as anything else that's considered God.
[03:22:09.056 --> 03:22:13.540]  He will be declaring himself to be God.
[03:22:14.241 --> 03:22:15.162]  The Almighty.
[03:22:15.162 --> 03:22:18.164]  He wants to be worshipped as the one true God.
[03:22:18.164 --> 03:22:19.945]  All the Muslims must bow.
[03:22:19.945 --> 03:22:21.826]  All the Jews must bow.
[03:22:21.826 --> 03:22:24.688]  All those that claim to believe in Christ must bow.
[03:22:24.688 --> 03:22:27.410]  All those that worship plants must bow.
[03:22:27.410 --> 03:22:29.211]  All the Hindus must bow.
[03:22:29.211 --> 03:22:35.716]  Whatever religion you could think of, you must bow to the Antichrist.
[03:22:35.716 --> 03:22:38.198]  The centralized figure.
[03:22:38.198 --> 03:22:40.079]  The end times scenario.
[03:22:41.056 --> 03:22:43.138]  Empowered by the dragon, that's Satan.
[03:22:43.138 --> 03:22:46.500]  Alright, literally possessed by Satan.
[03:22:46.500 --> 03:22:48.982]  False prophet fully activated.
[03:22:48.982 --> 03:22:53.346]  They are in full operation Antichrist.
[03:22:53.346 --> 03:22:57.329]  Right there, the unholy trinity that you see in the end time scenario.
[03:22:57.329 --> 03:23:01.793]  So, when it does come to Israel and it comes, I mean you go to Israel today.
[03:23:02.827 --> 03:23:05.249]  You go take a trip, you go check it out.
[03:23:05.249 --> 03:23:09.412]  They're already literally developing a third Jewish temple.
[03:23:09.412 --> 03:23:10.753]  The plans are there.
[03:23:10.753 --> 03:23:12.634]  They're already developing it.
[03:23:12.634 --> 03:23:14.916]  They're already strategizing it.
[03:23:14.916 --> 03:23:20.520]  They're already putting together what the models will look like, how they'll do it on the Temple Mount.
[03:23:20.520 --> 03:23:25.924]  They just haven't been given the access to start building on the Temple Mount because of the conflict up there.
[03:23:26.741 --> 03:23:28.343]  They'll start a religious war.
[03:23:28.343 --> 03:23:31.706]  But somehow, someway, the Bible's already foretold all this.
[03:23:31.706 --> 03:23:42.896]  The Jews, the state, the Israelis at the time, this is end-time scenario, the Jews and the Israelis at the time, they will embrace the Antichrist as the Messiah.
[03:23:42.896 --> 03:23:45.779]  They'll embrace him as Jesus Christ.
[03:23:45.779 --> 03:23:49.642]  This is the huge deception that you see in the end-time scenario.
[03:23:49.642 --> 03:23:52.445]  It will be the Israelis that embrace the Antichrist.
[03:23:53.901 --> 03:23:55.704]  I'm giving you guys the Bible.
[03:23:55.704 --> 03:23:56.625]  This is not my opinion.
[03:23:56.625 --> 03:23:58.167]  This is not my commentary.
[03:23:58.167 --> 03:23:59.889]  The Bible, okay?
[03:23:59.889 --> 03:24:06.318]  The Bible foretells that the Israelis, they will embrace the Antichrist.
[03:24:06.318 --> 03:24:07.359]  It's called a deception.
[03:24:07.359 --> 03:24:09.081]  They will be totally deceived.
[03:24:09.081 --> 03:24:11.765]  That's what the entire seven-year tribulation is about.
[03:24:13.404 --> 03:24:18.448]  The time of Jacob's trouble, speaking of Israel, they've turned their back on Christ.
[03:24:18.448 --> 03:24:20.590]  They rejected the Messiah at the first time.
[03:24:20.590 --> 03:24:32.698]  And then, the next indictment, I mean, even the Apostle Paul, who's a Jew, by the way, you look at Romans chapter 10, Romans chapter 11, the state of Israel, the Jewish people are under a spiritual stupor.
[03:24:32.698 --> 03:24:39.143]  They're under this spiritual numbness, this blindness, like a judgment from God.
[03:24:39.964 --> 03:24:43.225]  But there's hope because the Bible says God loves Israel.
[03:24:43.225 --> 03:24:44.166]  He loves his people.
[03:24:44.166 --> 03:24:45.226]  He wants to wake them up.
[03:24:45.226 --> 03:24:48.147]  He wants to see them saved and come to the real Messiah.
[03:24:48.147 --> 03:24:52.269]  But the first indictment was rejecting Christ.
[03:24:52.269 --> 03:24:53.829]  I'm giving you guys Bible.
[03:24:53.829 --> 03:24:55.010]  It's not anti-semitism.
[03:24:55.010 --> 03:24:57.611]  This is scripture, okay?
[03:24:57.611 --> 03:24:59.651]  The Jews rejected Jesus first.
[03:24:59.651 --> 03:25:01.212]  That's the first indictment.
[03:25:01.212 --> 03:25:02.713]  They went into a spiritual stupor.
[03:25:02.713 --> 03:25:03.553]  Total blindness.
[03:25:04.631 --> 03:25:05.611]  They're deceived, right?
[03:25:05.611 --> 03:25:12.054]  Just like mankind is deceived, the Gentiles are deceived, all people that are not Christians are deceived, right?
[03:25:12.054 --> 03:25:19.436]  The second indictment, this is according to the Bible, go research this, this is in the prophets, the Old Testament Jewish prophets foretell this.
[03:25:19.436 --> 03:25:24.418]  So I'm giving you Old Testament Jewish prophecy, okay?
[03:25:24.418 --> 03:25:29.740]  They foretell that the Israelis, the Jews, they will be deceived again.
[03:25:29.740 --> 03:25:31.441]  This is in Zechariah 14, you name it.
[03:25:33.542 --> 03:25:38.205]  They will be deceived again, they will embrace, because they're still looking for a Messiah.
[03:25:38.205 --> 03:25:41.326]  They're still searching for the first coming of the Messiah.
[03:25:41.326 --> 03:26:00.156]  Because they look to their scriptures, the Old Testament, and they still are under this impression that, well, Jesus was just a revolutionary, he was a heretic, so when they crucified and killed him, not just the Romans but the Jews of the day, that was necessary because he was blasphemous and the crimes of blasphemy claiming to be God.
[03:26:00.156 --> 03:26:02.758]  Jesus' indictment to the Jews at the time,
[03:26:03.593 --> 03:26:05.976]  It wasn't that he was offensive to them.
[03:26:05.976 --> 03:26:10.521]  It wasn't that he just didn't abide by their, you know, doctrines of man.
[03:26:10.521 --> 03:26:12.423]  Jesus claimed to be God.
[03:26:12.423 --> 03:26:14.545]  Okay?
[03:26:14.545 --> 03:26:16.808]  Because he's God in human flesh.
[03:26:16.808 --> 03:26:17.429]  Alright?
[03:26:17.429 --> 03:26:20.112]  That's what triggered the Jews of that day.
[03:26:20.112 --> 03:26:21.793]  The religious Pharisees.
[03:26:21.793 --> 03:26:23.636]  Triggered them beyond belief.
[03:26:23.636 --> 03:26:24.617]  That's what led them
[03:26:25.433 --> 03:26:29.097]  To literally conspire to murder Jesus Christ.
[03:26:29.097 --> 03:26:31.399]  That's the gospel message.
[03:26:31.399 --> 03:26:35.143]  Christ being put on the cross because Christ claimed to be God, man.
[03:26:35.143 --> 03:26:36.444]  Alright?
[03:26:36.444 --> 03:26:37.385]  That's blasphemy!
[03:26:37.385 --> 03:26:40.929]  Blasphemy laws, death, death, death, death, death.
[03:26:40.929 --> 03:26:46.074]  And the Romans just had to get involved because they viewed Jesus as an insurrectionist and a possible threat to the state.
[03:26:46.494 --> 03:26:56.521]  And he was a revolutionary figure, had thousands of people following him, not digitally on social media, literally, physically, a dude with a mob of thousands of people following him.
[03:26:56.521 --> 03:26:58.622]  Yes, Pontius Pilate saw that.
[03:26:58.622 --> 03:27:02.805]  The Romans saw that as, that's a threat to our power and our structures.
[03:27:02.805 --> 03:27:03.866]  Put an end to it.
[03:27:03.866 --> 03:27:07.288]  If the Jews want him dead, then you go along with it.
[03:27:07.288 --> 03:27:08.869]  Just put an end to the whole thing.
[03:27:08.869 --> 03:27:10.050]  We don't want riots.
[03:27:10.050 --> 03:27:11.471]  We don't want an insurrection.
[03:27:11.471 --> 03:27:12.892]  We don't want an uprising.
[03:27:12.892 --> 03:27:13.933]  Just put a stop to it.
[03:27:14.850 --> 03:27:19.491]  There was a lot going on with Jesus and his ministry, man, but that's the first indictment, right?
[03:27:19.491 --> 03:27:32.596]  The second indictment that you see, according to the Jewish prophets in the Old Testament, is that they will accept and embrace and be deceived by the Antichrist.
[03:27:32.596 --> 03:27:34.956]  This is all foretold.
[03:27:34.956 --> 03:27:40.218]  He's going to be a rock star worldwide, bring global peace, bring global unity.
[03:27:41.454 --> 03:27:48.717]  He's going to be an individual that will somehow, someway, bring religious peace between the Jews and the Muslims.
[03:27:48.717 --> 03:27:59.222]  These two that have been at war for thousands of years, a blood religious war, for somehow, someway, peace and safety and security, the Bible says, 1st, 2nd Thessalonians.
[03:27:59.222 --> 03:28:00.403]  This guy will be a rock star.
[03:28:02.020 --> 03:28:17.032]  And he will cut a peace treaty with the State of Israel, he'll cut a peace treaty with the Jews, they'll embrace him, and they'll view that, that right there, somehow bringing world peace, total rock star, they will view that as messianic levels.
[03:28:19.182 --> 03:28:22.425]  of fulfilling their scripture's prophecy.
[03:28:22.425 --> 03:28:30.333]  They will embrace, and it will be all satanically charged, it will all be demonically charged, and they will embrace the anti- This is all in the Bible, guys.
[03:28:30.333 --> 03:28:31.454]  This is not my opinion.
[03:28:31.454 --> 03:28:32.195]  Call it whatever you want.
[03:28:32.195 --> 03:28:32.855]  It's all in the Bible.
[03:28:32.855 --> 03:28:34.176]  Go see it for yourself.
[03:28:34.176 --> 03:28:38.280]  All of the Jewish prophets foretell this, okay?
[03:28:38.280 --> 03:28:40.462]  But it doesn't end there.
[03:28:40.462 --> 03:28:43.966]  They will see that they will be deceived at the end of the seven-year Great Tribulation.
[03:28:44.904 --> 03:28:46.165]  There will be a rendement.
[03:28:46.165 --> 03:28:48.387]  The Jews will finally see they've been deceived.
[03:28:48.387 --> 03:28:51.390]  They will see and identify the real Messiah.
[03:28:51.390 --> 03:28:52.591]  That's what God wants.
[03:28:52.591 --> 03:28:55.033]  He wants them all saved in an eternity forever.
[03:28:55.033 --> 03:28:55.594]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:55.594 --> 03:28:58.196]  We'll get into the news.
[03:28:58.196 --> 03:29:08.285]  We have three original, one-of-a-kind toothpaste designed by my father, a dentist, at Infolarestore.com that don't have fillers, that are filled with high-quality essential oils, and more.
[03:29:08.285 --> 03:29:09.867]  We have the turmeric toothpaste,
[03:29:10.799 --> 03:29:23.409]  We have the Ultimate Tooth Whitening with Pearl Calcium Toothpaste, and we have the amazing Activated Charcoal Toothpaste, again, with a whole bunch of key essential oils that are so good, not just for your teeth and your gums, but your whole mouth, your throat, and more.
[03:29:23.409 --> 03:29:25.490]  These are really game-changing toothpastes.
[03:29:25.490 --> 03:29:26.831]  They're very, very strong.
[03:29:26.831 --> 03:29:28.913]  Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride.
[03:29:28.913 --> 03:29:29.973]  Ours don't.
[03:29:29.973 --> 03:29:31.415]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[03:29:31.415 --> 03:29:33.016]  It is just chock-full.
[03:29:33.616 --> 03:29:37.359]  Of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[03:29:37.359 --> 03:29:39.361]  So, it's now back in stock.
[03:29:39.361 --> 03:29:40.922]  It became a best-seller.
[03:29:40.922 --> 03:29:44.185]  The turmeric toothpaste is available again at InfoMoreStore.com.
[03:29:44.185 --> 03:29:45.766]  We're selling out of the tooth whitening toothpaste.
[03:29:45.766 --> 03:29:46.867]  We've got some of that left.
[03:29:46.867 --> 03:29:51.131]  And we also have some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste in stock, but it's running out as well.
[03:29:51.131 --> 03:29:54.754]  So, all three toothpastes in stock for a limited time in InfoMoreStore.com.
[03:29:56.713 --> 03:30:01.714]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[03:30:01.714 --> 03:30:04.294]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[03:30:04.294 --> 03:30:05.775]  So let me get this straight.
[03:30:05.775 --> 03:30:25.218]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the Obama administration, Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son, Hunter, to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption, an event that Donald Trump looked into, sparking the first impeachment, enforcing the arming of Ukraine, in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia,
[03:30:25.538 --> 03:30:51.832]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had, but that they swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign, all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents, despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016, when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[03:30:51.832 --> 03:30:53.053]  Do I have that all straight?
[03:30:56.978 --> 03:31:03.905]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[03:31:03.905 --> 03:31:12.893]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:31:12.893 --> 03:31:15.095]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:31:15.735 --> 03:31:19.038]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:31:19.038 --> 03:31:27.564]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:31:27.564 --> 03:31:37.391]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[03:31:37.971 --> 03:31:43.874]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:31:43.874 --> 03:31:49.937]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[03:32:18.367 --> 03:32:19.727]  It is a game changer.
[03:32:19.727 --> 03:32:21.028]  Nobody's got something close to this.
[03:32:21.288 --> 03:32:21.488]  Yeah!
[03:32:39.099 --> 03:32:42.301]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:33:12.429 --> 03:33:23.017]  Cashless society, New World Order, global government, surveillance state, deep state operations.
[03:33:23.017 --> 03:33:24.538]  You're all watching it.
[03:33:24.538 --> 03:33:26.180]  You're all watching it unfold.
[03:33:26.180 --> 03:33:29.002]  The technology's there.
[03:33:29.002 --> 03:33:32.925]  The cultural mindset is ready and primed.
[03:33:32.925 --> 03:33:40.971]  Not just as the Bible foretells, the Jews and the State of Israel that will embrace the Antichrist, but the entire world.
[03:33:43.647 --> 03:33:47.589]  Entire world will be swayed, will be deceived.
[03:33:47.589 --> 03:33:50.370]  Accepting the global New World Order government.
[03:33:50.370 --> 03:33:52.311]  Accepting the global tyranny.
[03:33:52.311 --> 03:33:56.153]  Accepting a centralized leader, a centralized commander.
[03:33:56.153 --> 03:33:58.594]  A centralized economic system.
[03:33:58.594 --> 03:34:01.755]  Mark of the Beast in the hand, in the forehead.
[03:34:01.755 --> 03:34:03.916]  No access to the economy.
[03:34:03.916 --> 03:34:08.799]  That's an identification of worship as Him being your God.
[03:34:08.799 --> 03:34:09.159]  Your
[03:34:10.174 --> 03:34:15.975]  Commander-in-Chief, your almighty one, your theological allegiance.
[03:34:15.975 --> 03:34:19.616]  That's what this is all about.
[03:34:19.616 --> 03:34:36.559]  You see, post-2020, we saw not just countries, not just one, not just five, not just a couple, not just like the usual suspects that are always dealing with communism and tyranny and oppression, like North Korea or Cuba, Venezuela.
[03:34:36.559 --> 03:34:37.999]  No, we saw the entire world.
[03:34:39.170 --> 03:34:57.422]  Bend the knee to unelected bureaucrat organizations, World Health Organization, you name it, to lock down, not go outside, sacrifice your freedoms in the name of safety and protecting and saving lives.
[03:34:57.422 --> 03:35:00.224]  And we saw millions of people willing to do this.
[03:35:00.224 --> 03:35:02.666]  Okay, that's the next phase of tyranny.
[03:35:02.666 --> 03:35:06.208]  The next phase is that the mind psychologically, yes, there's awakening,
[03:35:07.246 --> 03:35:09.978]  Yes, there's people that will wake up to this reality.
[03:35:11.167 --> 03:35:40.938]  There are millions of people that will get red-pilled, Christ-pilled, they'll see the truth, pulled out of the Matrix, pulled out of the simulation, seeing exactly what everything truly is for what it is, not being deceived, recognizing who Agent Smith truly is, recognizing who the agents are, recognizing who's true, who's not, whoof, who's truly a sheep, who's truly awake, who's truly born again, who's truly speaking the truth, who's really got true information, aside from the real misinformation and disinformation, you get pulled out of the Matrix, you get pulled out of it, you see the
[03:35:41.658 --> 03:35:43.599]  And the truth shall set you free!
[03:35:43.599 --> 03:35:45.139]  And it does that.
[03:35:45.139 --> 03:35:47.640]  That's going to keep happening, man.
[03:35:47.640 --> 03:35:50.921]  But we're not going to be without persecution.
[03:35:50.921 --> 03:35:53.501]  We're not going to be without persecution.
[03:35:53.501 --> 03:35:55.962]  There will be revival.
[03:35:55.962 --> 03:35:58.623]  But there also will be persecution.
[03:35:58.623 --> 03:36:00.843]  The Bible foretells this very clear.
[03:36:00.843 --> 03:36:07.505]  Those who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will, shall, suffer persecution.
[03:36:09.346 --> 03:36:10.567]  It comes with the job, man.
[03:36:10.567 --> 03:36:11.748]  Christ said they hated me.
[03:36:11.748 --> 03:36:13.349]  They will hate you more!
[03:36:13.349 --> 03:36:15.430]  They called me Beelzebub.
[03:36:15.430 --> 03:36:16.611]  They called me the devil, man.
[03:36:16.611 --> 03:36:20.093]  What do you think they're gonna do to you guys?
[03:36:20.093 --> 03:36:23.235]  So be ready and anticipate it.
[03:36:23.235 --> 03:36:24.175]  It's to be accepted.
[03:36:24.175 --> 03:36:35.863]  Well, let's get into some of the news, guys, because everything that we talk about, World Economic Forum, all this global New World Order news that you're seeing, UN, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates,
[03:36:38.220 --> 03:36:43.842]  Noah Yuval Harari, all these satanic globalists that want to jack your mind into some kind of VR system.
[03:36:43.842 --> 03:36:49.225]  They are all pushing towards that goal.
[03:36:49.225 --> 03:36:51.526]  Here's a perfect example right here.
[03:36:51.526 --> 03:36:55.347]  Klaus Schwab praises CCP for its COVID control measures.
[03:36:55.347 --> 03:37:03.331]  Oh, well, of course, because Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates absolutely loves, absolutely loves the way that the CCP
[03:37:04.608 --> 03:37:06.749]  Oppresses their citizens.
[03:37:06.749 --> 03:37:08.650]  Loves the social credit scores.
[03:37:08.650 --> 03:37:10.451]  Loves the lockdowns.
[03:37:10.451 --> 03:37:16.995]  Loves seeing people screaming from their skyscraper apartment little shelter buildings.
[03:37:16.995 --> 03:37:26.780]  Loves seeing Chinese people being oppressed by being welded into their apartments to die as they get incinerated and set on fire.
[03:37:26.780 --> 03:37:28.521]  Klaus Schwab loves it!
[03:37:28.521 --> 03:37:29.401]  Loves it!
[03:37:29.401 --> 03:37:30.462]  He loves it!
[03:37:31.142 --> 03:37:32.843]  He loves to see you oppressed!
[03:37:32.843 --> 03:37:34.504]  Loves to see you die!
[03:37:34.504 --> 03:37:39.928]  Loves to see the CCP surveil their people and murder, murder, murder!
[03:37:39.928 --> 03:37:42.170]  He loves it!
[03:37:42.170 --> 03:37:44.211]  These people hate you.
[03:37:44.211 --> 03:37:47.273]  They hate you and they want to see you die.
[03:37:47.273 --> 03:37:48.894]  They don't want to see you oppressed.
[03:37:48.894 --> 03:37:50.875]  They don't want to see you with a lack of freedom.
[03:37:50.875 --> 03:37:52.937]  They want to see you die!
[03:37:56.033 --> 03:38:00.017]  Anyways, Klaus Schwab praises CCP for its COVID control measures.
[03:38:00.017 --> 03:38:01.578]  Oh, would you look at that!
[03:38:01.578 --> 03:38:20.975]  At the World Economic Forum's 14th annual meeting of the new champions, which took place in China, the founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, delivered a speech that continually, through the halls, you could hear it,
[03:38:21.826 --> 03:38:44.344]  Premier Li is the ex-premier of the People's Republic of China and a member of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee Politburo Standing Committee.
[03:38:44.344 --> 03:38:50.989]  Premier Li has a distinguished career in public service, having led
[03:38:52.060 --> 03:38:59.583]  See economic and social development off three major provinces.
[03:38:59.583 --> 03:39:04.705]  Joey Chang, young shoe and Shanghai.
[03:39:04.705 --> 03:39:17.831]  He has also been instrumental in opening up China's capital markets, attracting foreign investment and innovation and creating new
[03:39:18.632 --> 03:39:25.236]  Well, there you have it, guys.
[03:39:25.236 --> 03:39:29.798]  I apologize, having some issues with the video right now.
[03:39:29.798 --> 03:39:35.241]  I'll get that fixed later, but this is it, okay?
[03:39:35.241 --> 03:39:40.144]  Klaus Schwab hates you and has continually, okay, even to this day,
[03:39:41.269 --> 03:39:57.463]  Continually communicates, not only to the American people, continues to communicate to planet Earth that the way that the CCP dealt with their citizens during the COVID control lockdowns, zero COVID policy, he loves it.
[03:39:57.463 --> 03:39:58.404]  He loves it.
[03:39:58.404 --> 03:40:01.006]  He wants to see that rolled out worldwide.
[03:40:01.006 --> 03:40:03.488]  He wants to see everyone get terrorized.
[03:40:03.488 --> 03:40:05.690]  He wants to see everyone get oppressed.
[03:40:05.690 --> 03:40:07.972]  He wants to see everyone be oppressed.
[03:40:07.972 --> 03:40:09.373]  He wants to see everybody
[03:40:09.873 --> 03:40:32.840]  Put in a house, put in a skyscraper where they're controlled, where they're welded in, and they burn down the building, and they kill you, and they take your family, and they give you a social credit score, and you either get a red light, which means you can't have access to the economy, you can't go outside and exercise, you can't go out and socialize with your family, you have to stay inside,
[03:40:33.200 --> 03:40:36.161]  Stay in there because you spoke out against the regime.
[03:40:36.161 --> 03:40:37.362]  Stay inside your house.
[03:40:37.362 --> 03:40:46.746]  We're gonna weld you in and if the CCP, if the agents of the deep state come in and want to burn down your skyscraper and your little shanty, then you're gonna die.
[03:40:46.746 --> 03:40:54.148]  Oh, but if you're really being kind of good, we'll give you, we'll give you a yellow light.
[03:40:54.148 --> 03:40:56.509]  So that means that you're still a bad boy.
[03:40:56.509 --> 03:40:57.630]  You're still a bad girl.
[03:40:59.278 --> 03:41:01.942]  But we'll give you a little bit of leniency.
[03:41:01.942 --> 03:41:05.187]  You can go for a walk for four minutes.
[03:41:05.187 --> 03:41:09.693]  You can go outside for a walk for four minutes.
[03:41:09.693 --> 03:41:15.462]  And you won't be cut out of the economy, but we'll give you designated bugs.
[03:41:16.900 --> 03:41:19.101]  All right, we'll give you designated bugs.
[03:41:19.101 --> 03:41:21.462]  You can have four cockroaches a day.
[03:41:21.462 --> 03:41:23.543]  Four cockroaches a day.
[03:41:23.543 --> 03:41:26.724]  And you can go outside for four minutes a day.
[03:41:26.724 --> 03:41:29.625]  And you can look outside for four minutes a day.
[03:41:29.625 --> 03:41:30.806]  And after that, that's it.
[03:41:30.806 --> 03:41:31.186]  That's it.
[03:41:31.186 --> 03:41:33.487]  Because we got drones flying around.
[03:41:33.487 --> 03:41:35.528]  We got facial recognition.
[03:41:35.528 --> 03:41:42.951]  And we could see if you stick your dirty little freedom face outside that window, then we're going to come and burn down the building and kill you.
[03:41:45.543 --> 03:41:50.806]  Oh, but if you are a good citizen of the New World Order, you are good for CCP.
[03:41:50.806 --> 03:41:54.828]  You are good for... You, yes, you are good for Xi Jinping.
[03:41:54.828 --> 03:41:56.008]  You are good.
[03:41:56.008 --> 03:41:57.609]  Yes, you're good for the regime.
[03:41:57.609 --> 03:41:59.450]  CCP says you are okay.
[03:41:59.450 --> 03:42:00.511]  We love you.
[03:42:00.511 --> 03:42:02.612]  Yes, obey, obey, obey.
[03:42:02.612 --> 03:42:04.192]  You love the tyranny.
[03:42:04.192 --> 03:42:05.793]  You love the tyranny, don't you?
[03:42:05.793 --> 03:42:08.755]  You will own nothing, and we will control your life forever.
[03:42:08.755 --> 03:42:10.495]  If not, we will kill you too!
[03:42:10.495 --> 03:42:11.356]  CCP!
[03:42:11.356 --> 03:42:12.156]  CCP!
[03:42:12.156 --> 03:42:13.317]  Xi Jinping, brah!
[03:42:13.317 --> 03:42:13.577]  Yes!
[03:42:14.428 --> 03:42:17.789]  It's like this like.
[03:42:17.789 --> 03:42:19.249]  Oh, then you get the green light.
[03:42:19.249 --> 03:42:20.590]  Then you get the green light.
[03:42:20.590 --> 03:42:22.010]  You own nothing.
[03:42:22.010 --> 03:42:23.110]  You're happy.
[03:42:23.110 --> 03:42:26.011]  They take all of your product of means.
[03:42:26.011 --> 03:42:28.672]  OK, they take everything you own.
[03:42:28.672 --> 03:42:30.552]  They you own nothing.
[03:42:30.552 --> 03:42:32.993]  They control every aspect of your life.
[03:42:32.993 --> 03:42:35.293]  They control your flow of information.
[03:42:35.293 --> 03:42:37.134]  They control what you can see on the Internet.
[03:42:37.134 --> 03:42:40.735]  They're constantly surveilling you inside your house, outside your house.
[03:42:40.735 --> 03:42:42.155]  Your identity is totally gone.
[03:42:42.635 --> 03:42:50.969]  See, but only, only if you are in compliance with the regime can you have access to that civilization.
[03:42:50.969 --> 03:42:52.832]  That's what Klaus Schwab loves.
[03:42:52.832 --> 03:42:53.914]  Oh, I bet he does.
[03:42:53.914 --> 03:42:55.878]  That's why he wants to be the master of the universe.
[03:42:58.769 --> 03:43:05.135]  Two of our best-selling nootropics, or brain boosters, are now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:43:05.135 --> 03:43:10.139]  And for a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together, or 40% off when you get them individually.
[03:43:10.139 --> 03:43:12.801]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra.
[03:43:12.801 --> 03:43:14.243]  Two separate formulas.
[03:43:14.243 --> 03:43:16.825]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[03:43:17.445 --> 03:43:23.072]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy, again with no hangover or letdown.
[03:43:23.072 --> 03:43:28.658]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula, that's RainForce Ultra, that hits really, really quick.
[03:43:28.658 --> 03:43:29.118]  And I love it.
[03:43:29.118 --> 03:43:30.580]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[03:43:30.580 --> 03:43:34.565]  So if I've got to work at night, but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and stay nine o'clock at night.
[03:43:34.565 --> 03:43:37.948]  Got to stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview or something, and boom!
[03:43:39.050 --> 03:43:39.310]  Thank you.
[03:43:57.003 --> 03:44:02.986]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the Globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[03:44:02.986 --> 03:44:05.648]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[03:44:05.648 --> 03:44:07.829]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[03:44:07.829 --> 03:44:10.411]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[03:44:10.411 --> 03:44:13.632]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[03:44:13.632 --> 03:44:15.393]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[03:44:15.393 --> 03:44:22.037]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[03:44:22.037 --> 03:44:24.819]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[03:44:25.782 --> 03:44:27.543]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[03:44:56.543 --> 03:44:56.683]  Yes.
[03:45:13.371 --> 03:45:17.194]  You can go in and every month or every week, whenever you want, you program it.
[03:45:17.194 --> 03:45:20.136]  You just click it, and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[03:45:20.136 --> 03:45:21.237]  So please do that as well.
[03:45:21.237 --> 03:45:26.480]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees, instead of making 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[03:45:26.480 --> 03:45:28.082]  But these really are amazing products.
[03:45:28.082 --> 03:45:29.803]  The big July 4th sale is going on right now.
[03:45:29.803 --> 03:45:32.785]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the New World Order.
[03:45:32.785 --> 03:45:34.766]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[03:45:34.766 --> 03:45:36.167]  People are listening more than ever.
[03:45:36.167 --> 03:45:38.289]  But in this major recession going into depression,
[03:45:38.849 --> 03:45:41.253]  And with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[03:45:41.253 --> 03:45:42.194]  I know times are tough.
[03:45:42.194 --> 03:45:43.856]  So, thank you for your support.
[03:45:43.856 --> 03:45:47.441]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[03:45:47.441 --> 03:45:48.743]  That you can do for free.
[03:45:48.743 --> 03:45:50.926]  And that's just as important as Steve is on air.
[03:45:50.926 --> 03:45:54.150]  So, however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[03:45:54.150 --> 03:45:55.272]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[03:45:55.812 --> 03:45:56.832]  God bless you.
[03:45:56.832 --> 03:46:05.035]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[03:46:05.035 --> 03:46:06.496]  That is a hellish future.
[03:46:06.496 --> 03:46:15.899]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsware.com.
[03:46:15.899 --> 03:46:21.481]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:46:21.481 --> 03:46:23.462]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:46:24.062 --> 03:46:29.447]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsRaw.com.
[03:46:29.447 --> 03:46:33.390]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:46:33.390 --> 03:46:39.275]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:46:39.275 --> 03:46:41.357]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[03:46:42.137 --> 03:46:43.158]  Or unsigned copies.
[03:46:43.158 --> 03:46:53.546]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[03:46:53.546 --> 03:46:54.607]  This is an Infowar.
[03:46:54.607 --> 03:46:58.590]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[03:46:58.590 --> 03:47:04.495]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:12.312 --> 03:47:16.074]  All righty guys, I want to thank you guys for tuning in to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.074 --> 03:47:17.874]  I am your guest host Drew Hernandez.
[03:47:17.874 --> 03:47:20.956]  Make sure to go subscribe to my Rumble channel.
[03:47:20.956 --> 03:47:24.777]  Drew Hernandez Live, we go live Monday through Friday at 7 p.m.
[03:47:24.777 --> 03:47:26.198]  Pacific, that's 10 p.m.
[03:47:26.198 --> 03:47:27.198]  Eastern.
[03:47:27.198 --> 03:47:29.059]  Or go follow me on Twitter at Drew H. Live.
[03:47:29.059 --> 03:47:33.681]  Click the link in my bio and you can find all that great content.
[03:47:33.681 --> 03:47:36.463]  Actually starting a new show on LFATV called Based America.
[03:47:36.463 --> 03:47:39.344]  You guys can find that as well, just go search LFATV.
[03:47:41.394 --> 03:47:42.354]  Some breaking news guys!
[03:47:42.354 --> 03:47:50.019]  Google to remove Canadian news stories after Trudeau's Online News Act would require platforms to pay for links.
[03:47:50.019 --> 03:48:03.247]  Bill C-18 will make it harder for Canadians to find news online, make it harder for journalists to reach their audiences, and reduce valuable free web traffic to Canadian publishers.
[03:48:03.247 --> 03:48:05.929]  And obviously this is all going to be done in the name of
[03:48:06.733 --> 03:48:15.465]  Combating misinformation, combating disinformation, combating the errors that are out there from the mega Republican right-wing extremists.
[03:48:16.110 --> 03:48:27.921]  And those truckers, those Canadian Nazi truckers, those Nazis that just, they protested our lockdown measures, those Nazis, how dare that they want freedom?
[03:48:27.921 --> 03:48:32.646]  How dare that they point the finger at me, homosexual Justin Trudeau?
[03:48:32.646 --> 03:48:35.208]  How dare they point the finger at me?
[03:48:35.208 --> 03:48:36.589]  I'm Lord Farquaad!
[03:48:36.589 --> 03:48:38.491]  You should all be worshipping me!
[03:48:38.491 --> 03:48:41.134]  If I want you to have news, if I want you to have
[03:48:41.654 --> 03:48:49.020]  Any form of news that goes outside my homosexual regime, tyrannical regime, then I will tell you what it can be!
[03:48:49.020 --> 03:48:51.782]  I'll even tell Google what they'll be able to show you.
[03:48:51.782 --> 03:48:54.784]  We know Google's been getting down like this with the CCP.
[03:48:54.784 --> 03:49:09.475]  We know that Google has been obviously manipulating information for the Chinese people, giving them one perspective, giving them one channel, giving them one centralized ability to see something that they are wanting them to see.
[03:49:10.563 --> 03:49:12.564]  This is how the regimes function.
[03:49:12.564 --> 03:49:19.108]  And of course we know that homosexual Justin Trudeau, he's just another World Economic Forum puppet, literally in the hand.
[03:49:19.108 --> 03:49:20.568]  This guy loves tyranny.
[03:49:20.568 --> 03:49:22.149]  Loves Fidel Castro.
[03:49:22.149 --> 03:49:23.490]  Loves communism.
[03:49:23.490 --> 03:49:25.671]  Loves oppression.
[03:49:25.671 --> 03:49:28.633]  Praises tyrannical leaders right in front of the media.
[03:49:28.633 --> 03:49:32.495]  Laughs about it.
[03:49:32.495 --> 03:49:33.576]  I love tyranny.
[03:49:33.576 --> 03:49:34.676]  I love tyrants.
[03:49:34.676 --> 03:49:36.057]  Oh yeah, it's totally amazing, right?
[03:49:36.727 --> 03:49:38.828]  That's why they all talk like that.
[03:49:38.828 --> 03:49:42.190]  They love, dude, they are fanboys of Hitler.
[03:49:42.190 --> 03:49:44.231]  They are fanboys of Mao.
[03:49:44.231 --> 03:49:47.913]  They are fanboys, dude, they are fanboys of Stalin.
[03:49:47.913 --> 03:49:51.434]  My God, dude, that's why they all praise the CCP!
[03:49:51.434 --> 03:49:53.535]  They literally worship Xi Jinping.
[03:49:53.535 --> 03:49:54.396]  Why?
[03:49:54.396 --> 03:49:55.817]  Because he is the model.
[03:49:55.817 --> 03:49:58.078]  Why does Bill Gates call China the model?
[03:49:58.078 --> 03:50:00.559]  Why does Klaus Schwab call China the model?
[03:50:01.352 --> 03:50:07.856]  Okay, so obviously you're going to take a look at Justin Trudeau, a little homosexual right there, and he's going to love them too.
[03:50:07.856 --> 03:50:09.376]  He loves tyranny.
[03:50:09.376 --> 03:50:11.217]  He's going to command Google.
[03:50:11.217 --> 03:50:25.385]  He's going to want Canada to be the same model, oppressing freedom patriots, oppressing the flow of free information, oppressing the flow of free speech, the flow of the free press, because that's a threat to these regimes.
[03:50:26.112 --> 03:50:27.995]  They always will be a threat to these regimes.
[03:50:27.995 --> 03:50:31.200]  You and I will forever be a threat to these regimes.
[03:50:31.200 --> 03:50:32.923]  Not because we're violent.
[03:50:32.923 --> 03:50:36.368]  Not because we want physical hostility.
[03:50:36.368 --> 03:50:39.052]  Not because we want to go and run around and hurt people.
[03:50:39.052 --> 03:50:41.316]  For the most part, I just want to be left alone, dude!
[03:50:42.387 --> 03:50:44.148]  I just want to be left alone.
[03:50:44.148 --> 03:51:06.734]  I want to live in a Christ-based nation where we got some serious moral laws so that innocence is preserved and kept safe so we don't have pedophiles running around Seattle with their penises hanging out in front of little kids and lesbians running around with their disgusting hippo whale boobs flapping around in New York City.
[03:51:06.734 --> 03:51:08.975]  Did you guys see that footage from Savannah Hernandez last week?
[03:51:10.336 --> 03:51:17.919]  And you see little boys, little girls running up and down, penises jiggling everywhere, just full-blown Sodom and Gomorrah.
[03:51:17.919 --> 03:51:19.979]  I don't want to live in a society like that!
[03:51:19.979 --> 03:51:21.640]  I don't want to live in a world like that!
[03:51:21.640 --> 03:51:22.540]  Christ first!
[03:51:22.540 --> 03:51:23.500]  Christ first!
[03:51:23.500 --> 03:51:24.381]  Christ first!
[03:51:24.381 --> 03:51:24.901]  Let's go!
[03:51:24.901 --> 03:51:28.222]  You see, but they want the opposite.
[03:51:29.065 --> 03:51:32.851]  They want the opposite, which is Antichrist, lawlessness abounding.
[03:51:32.851 --> 03:51:38.379]  So they want a society that's totally centralized, controlled, monitored.
[03:51:38.379 --> 03:51:39.901]  So they're always watching.
[03:51:39.901 --> 03:51:41.143]  They're always monitoring.
[03:51:43.931 --> 03:51:50.533]  And of course, homosexual Justin Trudeau is a total, total New World Order, World Economic Forum puppet.
[03:51:50.533 --> 03:51:54.714]  Klaus Schwab is always pointing to this guy because that is the model.
[03:51:54.714 --> 03:52:05.656]  They look to China as the overall blueprint and they want to roll that out across the entire globe with their so-called New World Order puppet leaders.
[03:52:05.656 --> 03:52:06.797]  It's here in the West, guys.
[03:52:06.797 --> 03:52:07.977]  It's been here in the West!
[03:52:08.658 --> 03:52:10.240]  Tyranny's not coming.
[03:52:10.240 --> 03:52:12.482]  Tyranny's not a conspiracy theory.
[03:52:12.482 --> 03:52:13.844]  Tyranny's not on the way.
[03:52:13.844 --> 03:52:19.610]  The oppression is not a, you know, it's not like we got intel.
[03:52:19.610 --> 03:52:19.811]  Sure.
[03:52:21.668 --> 03:52:23.169]  The tyrants, they're on their way.
[03:52:23.169 --> 03:52:24.309]  They're en route.
[03:52:24.309 --> 03:52:26.349]  They're coming from across the Atlantic Ocean.
[03:52:26.349 --> 03:52:28.450]  They'll be coming across from the Pacific Ocean.
[03:52:28.450 --> 03:52:29.950]  They'll be hitting our shores soon.
[03:52:29.950 --> 03:52:31.070]  They're in our skies.
[03:52:31.070 --> 03:52:31.971]  They're on the way.
[03:52:31.971 --> 03:52:32.771]  They're en route!
[03:52:32.771 --> 03:52:33.391]  They're en route!
[03:52:33.391 --> 03:52:33.691]  No!
[03:52:33.691 --> 03:52:35.292]  They're inside the city gates!
[03:52:35.292 --> 03:52:36.512]  The tyrants are here!
[03:52:36.512 --> 03:52:38.772]  The New World Order's satanic agents are here!
[03:52:38.772 --> 03:52:40.193]  They're in our federal government!
[03:52:40.193 --> 03:52:41.413]  They're in the Democrat Party!
[03:52:41.593 --> 03:52:43.054]  They're in the Republican Party!
[03:52:43.054 --> 03:52:46.416]  The two-tier system, the two-party system, is an illusion!
[03:52:46.416 --> 03:52:47.616]  It's part of the Matrix!
[03:52:47.616 --> 03:52:57.202]  It's meant to quantify and distill your intellect, lower your IQ, to make you think that freedom is just two choices!
[03:52:57.202 --> 03:53:00.344]  That's what we're dealing with.
[03:53:00.344 --> 03:53:01.444]  It's all a PSYOP.
[03:53:01.444 --> 03:53:04.846]  It's all to keep you inside of the Matrix, to keep you controlled.
[03:53:04.846 --> 03:53:08.528]  A controlled, simulated environment.
[03:53:08.528 --> 03:53:09.849]  And now, at the age of the Internet,
[03:53:10.839 --> 03:53:22.949]  And now with the talks at the World Government Summit 2023, Davos 2023, talks of mastering technologies to master the universe, to master the future, they want to master time.
[03:53:22.949 --> 03:53:26.271]  Ladies and gentlemen, they want to master time.
[03:53:26.271 --> 03:53:28.613]  Who's truly the hero of time?
[03:53:28.613 --> 03:53:31.015]  Who's truly the author of time?
[03:53:31.015 --> 03:53:36.079]  Who's truly the architect of time itself that lives outside of time?
[03:53:36.079 --> 03:53:37.300]  It's God.
[03:53:37.941 --> 03:53:39.121]  And that's what these people want to be.
[03:53:39.121 --> 03:53:43.162]  That's why they're bringing up, oh, let's just make an economy inside of a VR reality.
[03:53:43.162 --> 03:53:44.142]  Why not?
[03:53:44.142 --> 03:53:46.523]  Let's just jack your conscience and all you Valharrari.
[03:53:46.523 --> 03:53:48.043]  Let's just take your conscience.
[03:53:48.043 --> 03:53:52.224]  Let's just jack your conscience into some kind of VR, AR, AI system.
[03:53:52.224 --> 03:53:53.364]  You don't need your body.
[03:53:53.364 --> 03:53:55.244]  We don't need human bodies anymore.
[03:53:55.244 --> 03:53:57.644]  We can just create some kind of, like, cyborg body.
[03:53:57.644 --> 03:53:58.545]  Take your conscience out.
[03:53:58.545 --> 03:54:00.165]  It's like Man of Steel.
[03:54:00.165 --> 03:54:01.605]  Remember the movie Man of Steel?
[03:54:01.605 --> 03:54:03.085]  Superman?
[03:54:03.085 --> 03:54:04.466]  Henry Cavill?
[03:54:04.466 --> 03:54:05.346]  His dad?
[03:54:05.346 --> 03:54:05.986]  Russell Crowe?
[03:54:07.546 --> 03:54:08.166]  Plays his dad.
[03:54:08.166 --> 03:54:10.827]  Plays Kal-El, Superman's dad.
[03:54:10.827 --> 03:54:12.807]  And he sacrifices himself.
[03:54:12.807 --> 03:54:14.827]  The planet dies.
[03:54:14.827 --> 03:54:16.348]  It explodes.
[03:54:16.348 --> 03:54:20.668]  But he downloaded his conscience into the AI-controlled ship.
[03:54:20.668 --> 03:54:22.949]  And the ship flew to planet Earth.
[03:54:22.949 --> 03:54:23.769]  Crash-landed.
[03:54:23.769 --> 03:54:26.609]  Right?
[03:54:26.609 --> 03:54:27.549]  Flew to planet Earth.
[03:54:27.549 --> 03:54:28.490]  Crash-landed.
[03:54:28.490 --> 03:54:36.011]  And the AI was under the ice in Antarctica for thousands of years till finally Kal-El, Superman grew up and
[03:54:37.518 --> 03:54:49.328]  His instincts led him there, he found the ship, and he goes down, and he's having a conversation in the spaceship, the AI-controlled spaceship, alien spaceship, having a conversation with his dad, decades later.
[03:54:49.328 --> 03:54:52.211]  He's like, Dad, how are you here?
[03:54:52.211 --> 03:55:03.280]  He's like, I'm not, it's just my conscious was downloaded into the AI programs of this ship, and it's kept my conscious alive, so I could finally, when I had the opportunity to talk to you, I could break down everything to you.
[03:55:03.280 --> 03:55:05.122]  I don't need my body, I'm just a hologram now.
[03:55:05.894 --> 03:55:07.956]  That's what they want for us.
[03:55:07.956 --> 03:55:15.223]  And the technology is getting closer and closer and closer to that place, because if they could remove your body, you're just a slave to technology.
[03:55:15.223 --> 03:55:16.965]  You're just a slave to the VR.
[03:55:16.965 --> 03:55:18.646]  You're just a slave to the AR.
[03:55:18.646 --> 03:55:20.148]  You're just a slave to the knurling.
[03:55:20.148 --> 03:55:23.751]  You don't need a body, just take your conscience, we'll jack you into a system.
[03:55:23.751 --> 03:55:26.114]  Oh, and by the way, the system's controlled by all of us!
[03:55:26.574 --> 03:55:36.240]  We control the AI, we control the centralized system, we control the technology, so your conscious will be forever uploaded into a system and we'll just control your entire existence from there.
[03:55:36.240 --> 03:55:37.681]  Your body will do away with it.
[03:55:37.681 --> 03:55:42.144]  If we want to put your conscious into another body, if we feel like it, we'll do it.
[03:55:42.144 --> 03:55:43.625]  That's the whole embodiment of possession.
[03:55:43.625 --> 03:55:47.067]  That's where these people want to go, you guys.
[03:55:47.067 --> 03:55:50.389]  Free conscious, free will is a problem for these people.
[03:55:51.610 --> 03:55:53.613]  That's why they want to control big tech.
[03:55:53.613 --> 03:55:55.635]  That's why they want to control technology.
[03:55:55.635 --> 03:55:58.098]  That's why they want to control any innovative system.
[03:55:58.098 --> 03:56:07.470]  That's why any type of new innovative piece of technology will always, always be immediately hijacked like that.
[03:56:08.010 --> 03:56:10.110]  By the New World Order satanic globalists.
[03:56:10.110 --> 03:56:10.731]  Why?
[03:56:10.731 --> 03:56:20.253]  Because they have known for decades, for thousands of years, that those innovative pieces of technology can be effective for one reason and one reason only.
[03:56:20.253 --> 03:56:23.993]  That's to control your mind.
[03:56:23.993 --> 03:56:25.274]  Therefore, controlling your life.
[03:56:25.274 --> 03:56:26.954]  Guys, this is the info war.
[03:56:26.954 --> 03:56:29.054]  This is the information war.
[03:56:29.054 --> 03:56:35.056]  It's the flow of information by controlling your mind, controlling your psyche, controlling your conscience.
[03:56:35.056 --> 03:56:36.956]  That's why Homo Trudeau is up there trying to
[03:56:37.805 --> 03:56:43.789]  Literally command Google what kind of information is going to come into the country and what's not.
[03:56:43.789 --> 03:56:56.138]  That's why the CCP is doing the exact same thing, incinerating citizens that are politically problems or threats to the regime that don't comply with locking down.
[03:56:56.138 --> 03:57:01.282]  And they use drones, they use AI facial recognition, they use what?
[03:57:01.282 --> 03:57:04.644]  They use technology to censor and oppress their people.
[03:57:05.962 --> 03:57:13.873]  And guys, I don't want to sound like a, you know, an out of date, you know, an out of date old guy or, you know, boomer that just doesn't understand technology.
[03:57:13.873 --> 03:57:16.317]  No, what I'm saying is technology can be used for good.
[03:57:16.317 --> 03:57:17.819]  It could be used for evil.
[03:57:17.819 --> 03:57:19.181]  We just got to be careful.
[03:57:19.181 --> 03:57:21.344]  And when we see those who are evil,
[03:57:22.054 --> 03:57:26.617]  Get their dirty little paws, their dirty little pedophilic hands on these technologies.
[03:57:26.617 --> 03:57:30.459]  Don't think that they are going to be for the embeddment or the empowerment of humanity.
[03:57:30.459 --> 03:57:41.486]  It's going to be to oppress humanity, to be weaponized against humanity, to censor your voice, censor your entire existence, censor every part of who you are as a human.
[03:57:41.486 --> 03:57:42.347]  My name is Drew Hernandez.
[03:57:42.347 --> 03:57:42.667]  Love you guys.
[03:57:42.667 --> 03:57:44.348]  I'll see you guys next week.
[03:57:44.348 --> 03:57:45.689]  Owen Schreier and the War Room is up next.
[03:57:46.616 --> 03:57:51.298]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.
[03:57:51.298 --> 03:57:53.259]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[03:57:53.259 --> 03:57:55.299]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[03:57:55.299 --> 03:57:57.780]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[03:57:57.780 --> 03:57:58.601]  Hey, what's better?
[03:57:58.601 --> 03:57:59.441]  Knockout?
[03:57:59.441 --> 03:58:00.782]  What's better?
[03:58:00.782 --> 03:58:01.522]  Down-and-out?
[03:58:01.522 --> 03:58:02.062]  What's better?
[03:58:02.062 --> 03:58:04.343]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[03:58:04.343 --> 03:58:09.265]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[03:58:09.938 --> 03:58:13.923]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[03:58:13.923 --> 03:58:15.264]  That's how our bodies work.
[03:58:15.264 --> 03:58:16.566]  They're all very diverse.
[03:58:16.566 --> 03:58:26.737]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night Sleep.
[03:58:27.478 --> 03:58:33.081]  This is a great formula, full of amazing safe compounds, give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep.

[03:58:46.653 --> 03:58:53.320]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:58:53.320 --> 03:58:55.242]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:58:55.242 --> 03:58:56.764]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[03:58:56.764 --> 03:58:59.507]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[03:58:59.507 --> 03:59:01.569]  And it says political prisoner.
[03:59:02.350 --> 03:59:04.311]  With an image of President Trump.
[03:59:04.311 --> 03:59:06.753]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:59:06.753 --> 03:59:08.894]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:59:08.894 --> 03:59:14.277]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[03:59:14.277 --> 03:59:15.478]  Jail background.
[03:59:15.478 --> 03:59:16.539]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:59:16.539 --> 03:59:20.661]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:59:20.661 --> 03:59:22.262]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[03:59:22.262 --> 03:59:23.283]  No, I'm not running for President.
[03:59:23.283 --> 03:59:25.844]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[03:59:25.844 --> 03:59:26.605]  Red, white, and blue.
[03:59:26.605 --> 03:59:27.525]  Alex Jones for President.
[03:59:27.525 --> 03:59:27.945]  2024.
[03:59:27.945 --> 03:59:31.047]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[03:59:31.047 --> 03:59:31.808]  Great way to fund.
[03:59:32.188 --> 03:59:36.491]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
