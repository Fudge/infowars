[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:13.739]  I actually think that we're going to see a cyber attack or a cyber disruption that is so vast, Alex, that it's going to basically disrupt the entire internet.
[00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:17.782]  I mean to the point of where it's going to shut everything down.
[00:00:17.782 --> 00:00:22.125]  We have become so connected as a society.
[00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:29.271]  My whole world for three and a half decades in the military was to think like our enemy
[00:00:30.137 --> 00:00:32.439]  You know, was going to potentially act.
[00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:49.589]  So I had to think about and then provide scenarios to those that I was supporting, the infantrymen, or the armor, or the aviators, or the operators who were going to go out and do a mission to put their own lives on the line.
[00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:54.112]  So for many, many years, three and a half decades of my life, I had to think about what was the enemy going to do.
[00:00:54.112 --> 00:00:55.033]  So I studied the enemy.
[00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:56.574]  I studied him relentlessly.
[00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:06.079]  And what I learned, one of the big lessons that I learned is what you just said, that the enemy will typically telegraph what it is that they're going to do.
[00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:17.811]  And if you learn enough about your enemy, enough about them, and you don't have to know every single deep, dark secret that's in their heart, because that's hard to say, but if you know that they're evil, then you better understand how evil
[00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:35.786]  Do you have hope that if Trump gets elected, despite all the challenges, he'll pardon you?
[00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:36.987]  Oh, I know he'll pardon us.
[00:01:36.987 --> 00:01:38.528]  I believe that with all my heart.
[00:01:38.528 --> 00:01:46.233]  You know, the thing is, is hopefully getting him, you know, for him to be able to get into the position where he can at least be
[00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:49.293]  I think on the bow to run, right?
[00:01:49.293 --> 00:01:51.975]  You have one minute remaining.
[00:02:11.345 --> 00:02:19.507]  When castles towered over vast landscapes and knights championed honor and valor, there came an unforeseen darkness.
[00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:26.709]  Amidst this impending doom stood a knight called Alex Jones, a brave and outspoken herald known as the Truth Sayer.
[00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.830]  Sir Alex Jones was not alone.
[00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.691]  In his most desperate hour in the battle against evil,
[00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:34.832]  A radiant light descended from the heavens.
[00:02:34.832 --> 00:02:39.554]  God, in all his glory and his legion of angels, stood by Alex's side.
[00:02:39.554 --> 00:02:44.676]  The battle raged on, but with every blow, Alex Jones' conviction grew stronger.
[00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:48.897]  With every truth he proclaimed, the demonic forces faltered.
[00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:56.200]  When the enemy was vanquished, Alex Jones swore a solemn oath that should the realm need him again, he would return.
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.449]  And now it's Alex Jones leading a full frontal assault on the satanic New World Order.
[00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:07.915]  Tune in at infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:14.195]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:22.938]  resistance against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:03:22.938 --> 00:03:25.438]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:26.879]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:29.401]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:31.743]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:03:31.743 --> 00:03:32.844]  This is all confirmed.
[00:03:32.844 --> 00:03:33.945]  This is not a drill.
[00:03:33.945 --> 00:03:38.209]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.750]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.631]  Apple 100%.
[00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:46.276]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[00:03:46.696 --> 00:03:51.778]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[00:03:51.778 --> 00:03:52.658]  This is happening.
[00:03:52.658 --> 00:04:00.682]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:04:00.682 --> 00:04:07.024]  Now, this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[00:04:07.024 --> 00:04:15.008]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion paradigm manipulation.
[00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:19.711]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[00:04:19.711 --> 00:04:23.213]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[00:04:23.213 --> 00:04:30.478]  Now, when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:33.460]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.724]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[00:04:38.724 --> 00:04:40.145]  It is the virtual reality AI.
[00:04:40.745 --> 00:04:47.152]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[00:05:00.993 --> 00:05:09.739]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:15.003]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[00:05:15.003 --> 00:05:18.326]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[00:05:18.326 --> 00:05:20.307]  And so they make me a herder of children.
[00:05:20.307 --> 00:05:27.552]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:35.601]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:41.188]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum, and it's being used against you.
[00:05:41.188 --> 00:05:46.133]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:48.155]  I have given you the transmission!
[00:05:48.155 --> 00:05:49.057]  Now break free!
[00:05:52.802 --> 00:06:01.550]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:08.776]  Thomas Jefferson If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:20.204]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[00:06:20.204 --> 00:06:30.472]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[00:06:31.283 --> 00:06:37.388]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:06:37.388 --> 00:06:42.552]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:06:42.552 --> 00:06:50.278]  It is 11, 12 Central Standard Time.
[00:06:50.278 --> 00:06:53.941]  We are coming to you from the Austin, Texas studios of InfoWars.
[00:06:53.941 --> 00:06:54.862]  It is Saturday.
[00:06:56.147 --> 00:06:58.689]  September 2nd, 2023.
[00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:06.193]  And for the next 45 minutes, General Flynn, one of the leading minds in the fight against the globalists, is joining us.
[00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:20.061]  And then Joe Biggs is scheduled, if he can get through from prison, true political prisoner, to be joining us as well after he was sentenced to 17 years in prison two days ago for committing absolutely no crime.
[00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:22.222]  And then I will continue on after he leaves, getting into the ADL.
[00:07:23.581 --> 00:07:30.576]  And the censorship combine and how they play a key role as a multinational intelligence agency against the American people have a large stack.
[00:07:30.576 --> 00:07:32.761]  They directly are working for the UN.
[00:07:32.761 --> 00:07:33.903]  We'll be laying that out, but...
[00:07:35.185 --> 00:07:39.067]  General Flynn's a busy guy, he's a hard guy to get on, but I begged him a few days ago.
[00:07:39.067 --> 00:07:41.948]  I said, I really think they're going to pull a false flag of some type.
[00:07:41.948 --> 00:07:44.749]  I see them pre-programming it in the news.
[00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:55.613]  I really need your expertise as the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and Trump's chief national security advisor, because you really have over-the-horizon understanding, unlike probably anybody else out there that's on our team.
[00:07:55.613 --> 00:07:57.214]  The enemy knows what's going on because they're planning it.
[00:07:57.754 --> 00:08:02.639]  Please come on and give us your views on that, on the lay of the land politically.
[00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:03.740]  There is a big awakening.
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.103]  People are figuring out this is a permanent coup happening.
[00:08:07.103 --> 00:08:09.586]  Our enemies are in deep trouble at every level.
[00:08:09.586 --> 00:08:19.255]  The indictments have backfired that they launched against Trump, but I don't think we should be too confident and we should talk about tomorrow's news today so we can get ahead of it.
[00:08:19.255 --> 00:08:21.597]  And a sterling example of this is 15 days ago,
[00:08:22.398 --> 00:08:30.202]  I went on air and told you that I talked to a high-level TSA manager who said they were told on the 15th they would start rolling everything out of September.
[00:08:30.202 --> 00:08:33.944]  A week later, they began to roll it out just like we basically said.
[00:08:33.944 --> 00:08:36.565]  Here is the New York Times.
[00:08:36.565 --> 00:08:40.467]  New Yorkers told to mask up for Labor Day as new COVID variant sparks fears.
[00:08:41.067 --> 00:08:44.750]  They're going to have drones watching people in New York with the borders wide open.
[00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.513]  All these universities and high schools have been saying you got to have shots to go there.
[00:08:48.513 --> 00:08:50.375]  They've been closing for a week.
[00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:51.836]  They're trying to bring the masking back.
[00:08:51.836 --> 00:08:53.798]  So we got ahead of that though.
[00:08:53.798 --> 00:08:59.683]  So there's massive political opposition by senators and governors and so many people.
[00:08:59.683 --> 00:09:01.564]  We're not going to just accept their incremental rollout.
[00:09:01.564 --> 00:09:02.985]  So just like we got ahead of that,
[00:09:03.866 --> 00:09:08.868]  We need to get ahead and do our best thinking on, if you're a globalist, what are you going to do?
[00:09:08.868 --> 00:09:10.969]  You got to get in their mind.
[00:09:10.969 --> 00:09:14.910]  And General Flynn is the expert to be able to give us that information.
[00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.711]  I appreciate him coming on on short notice.
[00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:19.812]  I'm going to try as much as I can to give him the floor.
[00:09:19.812 --> 00:09:22.193]  I said, I'm going to get your briefing, sir, what you think to the people.
[00:09:22.193 --> 00:09:24.054]  He said, well, I'd like to hear yours as well.
[00:09:25.034 --> 00:09:30.917]  So after he's done talking for a while, I'll kind of give a brief synopsis of what I think their next moves will probably be.
[00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:32.458]  Again, because I see the pre-programming.
[00:09:32.458 --> 00:09:34.438]  GeneralFlynn.com.
[00:09:34.438 --> 00:09:36.719]  He has an amazing new book, How to Fight AI.
[00:09:36.719 --> 00:09:38.520]  Find it all at GeneralFlynn.com.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.382]  He also has shared this on Twitter and a bunch of other publications.
[00:09:42.382 --> 00:09:49.645]  So everybody else watching, you can force multiply this so that not just to say a half million people are tuned in right now conservatively.
[00:09:49.645 --> 00:09:52.046]  And then this will be posted later as an archived video.
[00:09:52.046 --> 00:09:53.067]  A million or so will watch it.
[00:09:53.507 --> 00:09:55.168]  I'll air it on the main show next week.
[00:09:55.168 --> 00:09:56.709]  Three or four million will see it.
[00:09:56.709 --> 00:10:12.839]  But when listeners get excited, like you did two weeks ago on the TSA Lockdown 2.0 story, we take full control of the narrative and the enemy can't have that because now they're having to counter us instead of incrementally rolling out their brainwashing.
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.222]  Alex, thanks so much for having me, and this is a really important day.
[00:10:16.222 --> 00:10:16.542]  And I love
[00:10:35.174 --> 00:10:55.524]  I love the way that you come on on these weekend shows particularly, and I know you run these during the course of the week, but these weekend shows are really important because it gives people that are working their tails off, that don't have that kind of time to be able to listen to the depth that they should be, an ability to be able to hear some things on these shows.
[00:10:55.524 --> 00:11:00.006]  So this is super important, and let me just lay out a few things.
[00:11:00.006 --> 00:11:04.609]  Number one, I'm going to just state the obvious enemies that we have, and then I'm going to go into
[00:11:05.642 --> 00:11:09.265]  Those are not so obvious, but we've been talking about it.
[00:11:09.265 --> 00:11:10.346]  I've certainly been talking about it.
[00:11:10.346 --> 00:11:12.928]  You've been talking about it for, geez, maybe a decade.
[00:11:12.928 --> 00:11:17.031]  I certainly have been talking about it for the last few years, four or five years.
[00:11:17.031 --> 00:11:20.173]  But the obvious ones are, and I'll start right off the top with China.
[00:11:20.788 --> 00:11:21.709]  Right.
[00:11:21.709 --> 00:11:22.189]  China.
[00:11:22.189 --> 00:11:27.211]  China has infiltrated into every single institution in the United States of America.
[00:11:27.211 --> 00:11:28.312]  Government, U.S.
[00:11:28.312 --> 00:11:35.656]  government institutions, our entirety of our education system, especially our graduate and undergraduate programs.
[00:11:35.656 --> 00:11:42.399]  They've been coming into our colleges and universities for well over 25 years to the tune of
[00:11:42.979 --> 00:11:55.168]  Well, there's a minimum of about 100,000 a year, as high as 500,000 students a year, and they basically are attending some of the most elite universities that we have in this country.
[00:11:55.168 --> 00:11:58.110]  They're also in the institution of Hollywood, right?
[00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:04.435]  The moviemaking, the culturalization community, I call it, the culturalization community of America.
[00:12:05.442 --> 00:12:09.748]  The Chinese have gotten deep, deep into that, and they've been in that for a long, long time.
[00:12:09.748 --> 00:12:14.395]  And then they're also in the institutions of the cartels.
[00:12:14.395 --> 00:12:19.422]  And I would call them the sort of on the street
[00:12:20.751 --> 00:12:34.956]  You know, teamed together, where the Chinese have teamed together with the cartels, and we know that that's a fact, because we already have over 100,000 killed in action by fentanyl in this country.
[00:12:34.956 --> 00:12:35.836]  So that's China.
[00:12:35.836 --> 00:12:36.697]  That's China.
[00:12:36.697 --> 00:12:37.777]  All right?
[00:12:37.777 --> 00:12:46.120]  Now let's just, and there's some other things, and I'll talk to China, because I'm going to jump to cyber in a second, because I think cyber is something that everybody needs to
[00:12:47.012 --> 00:12:51.541]  Understand and they need to know what that means and how we are going to be affected by cyber.
[00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:59.492]  The other part about China, and I am going to talk about the health crisis that we already see being forced down our throats again.
[00:12:59.492 --> 00:13:01.293]  The second one is Russia, right?
[00:13:01.293 --> 00:13:06.474]  Russia is aligned with China as a communist ideology.
[00:13:06.474 --> 00:13:13.156]  The other element here is this BRICS alignment of countries, right?
[00:13:13.156 --> 00:13:16.617]  Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.
[00:13:16.617 --> 00:13:17.257]  They just finished
[00:13:17.777 --> 00:13:18.637]  We're good to go.
[00:13:37.325 --> 00:13:55.679]  Energy deals, economic deals, military deals for years, for the last, you know, certainly the last 20, 25 years, but in the last five to six years, I've seen them increase their portfolio of arrangements, economic to military and other arrangements,
[00:13:57.171 --> 00:14:02.936]  You know, that are well, well past anything the United States of America has been able to keep up with.
[00:14:02.936 --> 00:14:09.421]  And these last couple of years, it's really, really, it's catapulted into a new level.
[00:14:09.421 --> 00:14:10.422]  Yeah, there you go.
[00:14:10.422 --> 00:14:21.811]  And they're purchasing, you know, the sale of oil is now going to be done not in petrodollars, meaning US dollars, it's going to be done in the currency of the countries that are purchasing it.
[00:14:22.251 --> 00:14:23.773]  The third, so Russia.
[00:14:23.773 --> 00:14:30.822]  And of course, we have Russia right now in this war in Eastern Europe, which is a total distraction.
[00:14:30.822 --> 00:14:33.245]  We, the American people, are being distracted.
[00:14:33.245 --> 00:14:34.987]  We're being ripped off.
[00:14:34.987 --> 00:14:36.950]  We're paying through our teeth.
[00:14:39.032 --> 00:14:39.272]  We're good.
[00:14:55.462 --> 00:15:06.411]  The Iranian people, I know a lot of Iranians and I have a lot of friends, but the Iranian government is still in coordination with the Democrat Party, right?
[00:15:06.411 --> 00:15:09.233]  I call it the Marxist Party of the left.
[00:15:09.233 --> 00:15:18.301]  So they are still negotiating and they are still going to allow Iran, we, the United States of America, are going to
[00:15:19.326 --> 00:15:21.607]  Well, essentially build a nuclear weapon.
[00:15:21.607 --> 00:15:25.790]  And this is insane because this is still the leading state sponsor of terrorism on the planet.
[00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:33.795]  Iran still shouts from the tops of the buildings, you know, death to America, death to the Satanists, death to Israel.
[00:15:33.795 --> 00:15:35.636]  So Iran, the fourth country
[00:15:36.431 --> 00:15:37.831]  is North Korea.
[00:15:37.831 --> 00:15:41.292]  North Korea is clearly aligned with China.
[00:15:41.292 --> 00:15:42.992]  There's no doubt about that.
[00:15:42.992 --> 00:15:45.253]  They are a nuclear power.
[00:15:45.253 --> 00:15:48.034]  They will be used.
[00:15:48.034 --> 00:15:51.954]  So the North will be used by China to sort of do the big head fake.
[00:15:51.954 --> 00:16:03.417]  So if we start to see Kim Jong-un of North Korea start to conduct things, do things over there in his sphere of the world, what we call the Near East,
[00:16:04.142 --> 00:16:18.328]  If he starts to do things over in the Near East, where he starts to fire missiles, test missiles again, maybe test a space launch, which they have done in the past, then we're going to start to see other movements.
[00:16:18.328 --> 00:16:24.911]  Our country should be able to juggle more balls at the same time, multiple balls at the same time.
[00:16:24.911 --> 00:16:29.273]  But under this administration, we are incapable of doing that right now.
[00:16:29.793 --> 00:16:33.596]  So North Korea is the fourth country.
[00:16:33.596 --> 00:16:36.298]  So China, Russia, Iran, North Korea.
[00:16:36.298 --> 00:16:38.540]  And then you have these other crises, right?
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:47.246]  The border crisis, the narcotics crisis that I mentioned about fentanyl, the domestic crime, the rise of domestic crime in this country, Venezuela.
[00:16:47.246 --> 00:16:58.935]  I mentioned Venezuela in a way because what is happening, as we've seen the Chinese starting to come across the border, and we recently saw Uzbeks, right, a group of Uzbeks,
[00:16:59.495 --> 00:17:05.982]  And Uzbeks are a strong member of ISIS and a strong member of Al-Qaeda.
[00:17:05.982 --> 00:17:11.087]  And so we just had a group of Uzbeks cross the border down in the southern border.
[00:17:11.087 --> 00:17:21.057]  And what's happening with Venezuela is Venezuela is being used as a conduit, being used as a conduit for some of these other nations around the world that aren't in this hemisphere.
[00:17:22.017 --> 00:17:35.166]  So you're going to see Chinese, we have seen an awful lot of Chinese, to the tune of about a thousand a day coming up through what's called the Darien Gap, down between Columbia and Panama, and making their way up to the U.S.
[00:17:35.166 --> 00:17:35.826]  border.
[00:17:35.826 --> 00:17:40.089]  And thanks to Michael, Jan, and others, I know you're working closely with, thinking about going down there, both of us.
[00:17:40.729 --> 00:17:42.251]  I mean, he has the footage.
[00:17:42.251 --> 00:17:43.693]  They built a giant U.N.
[00:17:43.693 --> 00:17:45.515]  base down there at the Darien Gap.
[00:17:45.515 --> 00:17:48.119]  And these are mainly military-age men, Chinese.
[00:17:48.119 --> 00:17:52.024]  I mean, I can tell by the look of them, they look military to me, most of them.
[00:17:52.623 --> 00:17:54.564]  These are military age men, of course they are.
[00:17:54.564 --> 00:18:02.008]  And China doesn't just—and the good reporting by Michael as an example, when he starts to ask questions like, where did they come from?
[00:18:02.008 --> 00:18:03.649]  These guys are coming from China.
[00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:10.472]  The Chinese do not let refugees leave their country except for a specific purpose.
[00:18:10.472 --> 00:18:14.934]  So we also have these other border—along our border, along the U.S.
[00:18:14.934 --> 00:18:19.857]  border—these border posts, these military camps that have been built
[00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:24.862]  I've seen a couple.
[00:18:24.862 --> 00:18:25.823]  I've been to one of them.
[00:18:25.823 --> 00:18:26.443]  I've seen these.
[00:18:26.443 --> 00:18:28.285]  These are huge, huge camps.
[00:18:28.285 --> 00:18:31.608]  And these aren't camps for a couple of kids.
[00:18:31.608 --> 00:18:32.429]  These are camps.
[00:18:32.429 --> 00:18:34.331]  These are large, large camps.
[00:18:34.331 --> 00:18:39.656]  And they are housing thousands and thousands, primarily military-age men.
[00:18:39.656 --> 00:18:41.657]  And then you have to start to think about where they're going.
[00:18:42.862 --> 00:19:01.610]  So Venezuela, I mentioned Venezuela because Venezuela has not only given up their prisoners and their psychopaths, but they're also acting as a conduit to pass through Iranians, to pass through Uzbeks, to pass through Chinese and get them on up into the Central American isthmus there and head on up to the United States.
[00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:05.412]  The other two areas that I wrote down here is financial and economic.
[00:19:06.713 --> 00:19:07.153]  I think so.
[00:19:19.753 --> 00:19:20.954]  Pounding this, right?
[00:19:20.954 --> 00:19:23.015]  We have to pound this into our audience.
[00:19:23.015 --> 00:19:28.017]  We've got to pound it into American psyche, because the enemy is real.
[00:19:28.017 --> 00:19:31.898]  And when we talk about sort of an enemy headquarters, it's Davos, Switzerland.
[00:19:31.898 --> 00:19:34.540]  And the name of the organization is the World Economic Forum.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.602]  And the name of the leader is Claude Schwab.
[00:19:38.602 --> 00:19:48.246]  And then, like he says, he says there's about 600 of the smartest people in the world in his very, very arrogant sort of way.
[00:19:48.906 --> 00:19:58.670]  But there are actually a couple of thousand that are part of this organization, and these thousand, a couple of thousand, are sprinkled all over the world in various governments.
[00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.051]  Some of them are running governments.
[00:20:00.051 --> 00:20:05.093]  Trudeau is one up in Canada, members of his cabinet, members of his government.
[00:20:05.093 --> 00:20:06.854]  Same with France, Macron.
[00:20:06.854 --> 00:20:09.415]  And there are other members of the World Economic Forum
[00:20:10.035 --> 00:20:19.481]  There's corporations that are running not only governments and are parts of the bureaucracies and systems of many of these governments around the world.
[00:20:19.481 --> 00:20:20.462]  Australia is another.
[00:20:20.462 --> 00:20:22.103]  The United States is another.
[00:20:22.103 --> 00:20:24.365]  But there's also corporations.
[00:20:24.365 --> 00:20:27.647]  There's corporations that are members of the World Economic Forum.
[00:20:27.647 --> 00:20:36.933]  So when we hear about all this corporate wokeness, since 1972, essentially, there has been this organizing effect
[00:20:37.546 --> 00:20:38.166]  Yeah, great reset.
[00:20:56.937 --> 00:21:05.480]  Like another health crisis discussion, even though in this country, you know, like, you know, we're going to start, you know, we'll start to hear more, we will not comply, right?
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.442]  Well, I've got all that and we should not comply with any of this nonsense.
[00:21:09.442 --> 00:21:13.043]  But I'm starting to see things like malaria.
[00:21:13.043 --> 00:21:16.785]  You know, I pay very close attention to these indicators.
[00:21:16.785 --> 00:21:22.647]  So in a health crisis in this country, which is going to strain the financial and economic system, and they're going to take advantage of it.
[00:21:22.647 --> 00:21:24.808]  So this enemy force that I just laid out
[00:21:25.402 --> 00:21:38.448]  And they have subordinate organizations underneath the World Health Organization, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the United Nations, which you have always been highlighting and what they're up to.
[00:21:38.448 --> 00:21:43.731]  And it's important that we understand where the UN is at on a given day, particularly in this country.
[00:21:44.474 --> 00:21:49.938]  But we've seen cases, small anecdotal numbers right now, of malaria in this country.
[00:21:49.938 --> 00:21:57.004]  We have never seen malaria in the United States of America, yet we've got a couple of cases down here in Florida, a couple of cases up in Washington, D.C.
[00:21:57.004 --> 00:21:59.966]  I think that I just read about one out in Texas the other day.
[00:21:59.966 --> 00:22:05.711]  I mean, these are anecdotal, but when malaria hits and you're not ready for it, it can spread very quickly.
[00:22:05.711 --> 00:22:12.416]  The other one that is also a mosquito-borne type disease, and it seems like this is the Bill Gates thing,
[00:22:12.996 --> 00:22:17.320]  Yeah, and so you say, you know, because the other one that's up there,
[00:22:28.567 --> 00:22:32.310]  Yeah, that's a literal black helicopter that Bill Gates funds spraying mosquitoes on Floridians.
[00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:49.111]  Yeah, I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:22:49.111 --> 00:22:57.397]  And, you know, again, part of what I do want to talk about in some of the time that I have is the Republican Party.
[00:22:57.397 --> 00:22:58.458]  Where's the Republican Party?
[00:22:58.458 --> 00:23:03.962]  Well, sir, you've got the floor, but let me just interject here because you're reading my mind.
[00:23:03.962 --> 00:23:05.644]  I want to, before you have to go, get into
[00:23:06.893 --> 00:23:09.254]  I understand you're fighting for Americans.
[00:23:09.254 --> 00:23:19.360]  The Chai Com Power Group, the Russians, the globalists incestuously work with both, but they're undermining America, trying to demoralize us, trying to bankrupt us, destroying our cities.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:26.663]  What is their... I mean, obviously, I believe you would agree the globalists are the most powerful bloc.
[00:23:26.663 --> 00:23:28.064]  Here's their ultimate goal.
[00:23:28.064 --> 00:23:28.925]  Here's their ultimate goal.
[00:23:28.925 --> 00:23:29.545]  I'm sorry, Alex.
[00:23:29.545 --> 00:23:30.265]  Here's their ultimate goal.
[00:23:30.265 --> 00:23:31.586]  No, that's exactly what I was about to ask.
[00:23:31.586 --> 00:23:32.386]  What is their goal?
[00:23:34.031 --> 00:23:48.236]  I've said this very publicly, that their original intent was eight years of Obama—steal this country, eight years of Obama, and then get Hillary Clinton in charge and have eight years of Hillary Clinton, and we would be done.
[00:23:48.236 --> 00:23:51.117]  You'd be done, I'd be done, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
[00:23:51.117 --> 00:23:54.958]  So to your audience and to the American people, that was their plan.
[00:23:54.958 --> 00:24:02.061]  Eight years of Obama, and if you didn't get on board with Obama, you didn't get on board with his team, you were out.
[00:24:02.581 --> 00:24:04.783]  You were out like I was out.
[00:24:04.783 --> 00:24:13.068]  And then the next step, the next stage, was a controlled political person in the name of Hillary Clinton.
[00:24:13.068 --> 00:24:15.470]  And keep her in there for another eight years.
[00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:16.971]  And we were blessed.
[00:24:16.971 --> 00:24:24.035]  We were blessed that Trump, this warrior, stood up and using his own resources and putting his own life on the line.
[00:24:24.035 --> 00:24:26.737]  And you, and then that helped derail their program for a while.
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:28.260]  Exactly.
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.722]  So that 2016 campaign was a hard-fought campaign.
[00:24:31.722 --> 00:24:33.203]  We knew going in it was going to be hard.
[00:24:33.203 --> 00:24:38.026]  I mean, the depth of infiltration, though, was not only in our government.
[00:24:38.026 --> 00:24:43.048]  When I say our government, it's not only in the bureaucracy, in the deep state, the intel community.
[00:24:43.048 --> 00:24:44.909]  It was all the way into the White House.
[00:24:44.909 --> 00:24:51.193]  It was all the way in, including inside of the— And their first order of business was to get rid of you.
[00:24:52.944 --> 00:24:53.965]  Exactly, and there you go.
[00:24:53.965 --> 00:24:56.166]  There's the guy right there, Obama.
[00:24:56.166 --> 00:25:04.611]  There's going to be some things coming out on him in the next couple of weeks on Obama, his relationships, the type of person that he is.
[00:25:04.611 --> 00:25:08.853]  Well, you said that six months ago, and now it has come out.
[00:25:08.853 --> 00:25:11.915]  The homosexuality, the fact that he's blackmailed.
[00:25:11.915 --> 00:25:14.676]  So you obviously knew.
[00:25:14.676 --> 00:25:16.117]  You're saying even more stuff's coming out.
[00:25:17.369 --> 00:25:18.770]  Yeah, more stuff is going to come out.
[00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:23.495]  And I think that what we're going to find is that we've been lied to.
[00:25:23.495 --> 00:25:25.737]  So that's in the past.
[00:25:25.737 --> 00:25:27.418]  But we cannot forget that, Alex.
[00:25:27.418 --> 00:25:29.900]  We cannot forget that we've been lied to.
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.202]  We've been deceived.
[00:25:31.202 --> 00:25:33.283]  This is how they do it.
[00:25:33.283 --> 00:25:35.886]  And they have this globalist structure above them.
[00:25:36.446 --> 00:25:36.526]  Yes.
[00:25:36.526 --> 00:25:38.807]  And so the big issue is why?
[00:25:38.807 --> 00:25:40.548]  Why do they want the United States of America?
[00:25:40.548 --> 00:25:45.530]  They want the United States of America for one thing, and that's resources, right?
[00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:46.270]  Resources.
[00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:51.992]  Energy, food, and people that we have, the innovation and the innovative people that we have.
[00:25:51.992 --> 00:25:56.314]  I mean, if they could, China would turn the United States of America into a slave state.
[00:25:56.314 --> 00:25:58.915]  The World Economic Forum would turn us into a slave state.
[00:26:00.056 --> 00:26:08.523]  So, General, what is the calculus to put their boot on our neck and cut off our resources, just bankrupt Americans, drive them into submission?
[00:26:08.523 --> 00:26:11.926]  Yeah, so here's what I think we're going to see.
[00:26:11.926 --> 00:26:15.610]  And it's already been stated, Shrove has said some of this.
[00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:24.578]  I think we're going to see something in the world of, you know, and we've just finished with this book, this artificial intelligence book, but I actually think that we're going to see a cyber attack
[00:26:25.402 --> 00:26:35.890]  Or a cyber disruption that is so vast, that is so vast, Alex, that it's going to basically disrupt the entire internet.
[00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:37.311]  And I mean to the point of
[00:26:38.118 --> 00:26:38.458]  I think so.
[00:26:57.766 --> 00:27:13.946]  I mean, but we have a government, the United States government, has great control over the internet, great control over the internet, great control, and has great and strong and powerful weapon systems in the world of cyber.
[00:27:14.486 --> 00:27:15.507]  Cyber weapons, right?
[00:27:15.507 --> 00:27:17.748]  Lasers, things like that.
[00:27:17.748 --> 00:27:19.850]  Space-based systems.
[00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:30.457]  So, I actually think that we're going to see some type of cyber attack that's so vast, it's going to potentially disrupt or disconnect the Internet.
[00:27:30.457 --> 00:27:32.819]  Let's stop and slow down, and I want you to start over.
[00:27:32.819 --> 00:27:33.800]  This is so important.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.401]  And explain to me, from your expert perspective,
[00:27:37.342 --> 00:27:39.323]  Why do the globalists telegraph?
[00:27:39.323 --> 00:27:41.163]  People ask how I'm able to predict stuff.
[00:27:41.163 --> 00:27:43.084]  They telegraph what they're going to pull next.
[00:27:43.084 --> 00:27:44.204]  A virus is going to hit.
[00:27:44.204 --> 00:27:45.504]  It's going to disrupt Trump.
[00:27:45.504 --> 00:27:46.625]  A virus will defeat Trump.
[00:27:46.625 --> 00:27:50.086]  It's basically what Fauci and Schwab said a year before.
[00:27:50.086 --> 00:27:51.786]  And then it happens.
[00:27:51.786 --> 00:27:56.187]  I guess they want to brag to their minions to show off or they're pre-programming their people.
[00:27:56.187 --> 00:28:01.229]  Because if I was going to do something evil like that, and of course I wouldn't, but hypothetically, I wouldn't telegraph it.
[00:28:01.229 --> 00:28:04.590]  They're telegraphing that the cyber is the next big move.
[00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.990]  It'll make
[00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:10.154]  It'll make COVID, you know, look like nothing in Schwab's words.
[00:28:10.154 --> 00:28:14.457]  So why are they telegraphing and then lay out how serious this is?
[00:28:14.457 --> 00:28:16.679]  Okay, so for everybody, right?
[00:28:16.679 --> 00:28:27.006]  My whole world for three and a half decades in the military was to think like our enemy, you know, was going to potentially act.
[00:28:27.006 --> 00:28:31.250]  So I had to think about and then provide scenarios to those
[00:28:32.256 --> 00:28:44.123]  That I was supporting the infantrymen, or the armor, or the aviators, or the operators who were going to go out and do a mission to put their own lives on the line.
[00:28:44.123 --> 00:28:48.666]  So for many, many years, three and a half decades of my life, I had to think about what was the enemy going to do.
[00:28:48.666 --> 00:28:49.567]  So I studied the enemy.
[00:28:49.567 --> 00:28:52.288]  I studied them relentlessly.
[00:28:52.288 --> 00:29:00.574]  And what I learned, one of the big lessons that I learned is what you just said, that the enemy will typically telegraph what it is that they're going to do.
[00:29:01.804 --> 00:29:14.645]  If you learn enough about your enemy, enough about them, and you don't have to know every single deep, dark secret that's in their heart, because that's hard to say, but if you know that they're evil, then you better understand how evil operates.
[00:29:14.645 --> 00:29:15.907]  But what they typically do
[00:29:17.034 --> 00:29:18.374]  And what they've always done.
[00:29:18.374 --> 00:29:20.635]  They've always told us what they were going to do.
[00:29:20.635 --> 00:29:23.516]  And people used to say to me, Jesus, Flynn, you know, you're, you're a madman.
[00:29:23.516 --> 00:29:26.117]  Some of the, some of the things that you come up with that you say to the enemy.
[00:29:26.117 --> 00:29:28.077]  For those that don't know, you never toot your own horn.
[00:29:28.077 --> 00:29:36.720]  You were the first Major General, I mean, Major General, I mean, you know, major person in the staff to say China's going to break and double crosses.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.461]  I mean, you basically laid all this out a decade before it happened.
[00:29:39.461 --> 00:29:41.921]  So why, why do bad guys telegraph?
[00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:44.242]  Answer that for me and then get into what you think's next.
[00:29:45.043 --> 00:29:51.374]  Yeah, they telegraph because they don't have all of the resources that they need at their
[00:29:52.043 --> 00:29:53.263]  at their beck and call.
[00:29:53.263 --> 00:30:00.185]  They need to rely on other aspects of the sort of the geography and the landscape.
[00:30:00.185 --> 00:30:05.666]  Just like the average anti-fight isn't getting orders to burn things down, they just know go out and burn stuff down.
[00:30:05.666 --> 00:30:06.146]  Exactly.
[00:30:06.146 --> 00:30:08.827]  So they're calling on their militia basically.
[00:30:08.827 --> 00:30:09.447]  Exactly.
[00:30:09.447 --> 00:30:15.608]  It's like I've got to put that, it's a dog whistle, it's a bit of a dog whistle, but they need to be able to rally because
[00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:20.223]  When they do these kinds of, from an enemy perspective, that's why they do it.
[00:30:20.223 --> 00:30:22.404]  They let it be known what they're going to do.
[00:30:22.404 --> 00:30:23.244]  They get the word out.
[00:30:23.244 --> 00:30:36.010]  And if we're good, right, guys like you, especially guys like you, and people like myself and others, if we're good and we're paying attention and we're listening to what they're saying, they're going to tell us exactly what they're going to do.
[00:30:37.725 --> 00:30:39.346]  And you have to connect a few dots.
[00:30:39.346 --> 00:30:42.388]  You've got to do some analytics.
[00:30:42.388 --> 00:30:48.112]  In some cases, you've got to do deep analysis and some link analysis, as some of your listeners would definitely know what I'm talking about.
[00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:49.673]  And you've got to put the picture together.
[00:30:49.673 --> 00:30:58.679]  It's like I say on the battlefield in warfare, you're not going to be handed a thousand-piece puzzle with all thousand pieces.
[00:30:58.679 --> 00:30:59.700]  You're going to be handed a thousand
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:00.541]  I think so, yeah.
[00:31:24.541 --> 00:31:27.123]  All while they're planning their big ticket thing.
[00:31:27.123 --> 00:31:29.184]  Like even going after Trump.
[00:31:29.184 --> 00:31:32.025]  All of these indictments.
[00:31:32.025 --> 00:31:33.426]  I was reading a thing this morning.
[00:31:33.426 --> 00:31:38.109]  I think we're up to like 74, 75 felony indictments for 700 and something years.
[00:31:38.109 --> 00:31:39.129]  It's insane.
[00:31:39.129 --> 00:31:45.593]  If they had just given Trump like one or two felony counts, I'd be worried.
[00:31:45.593 --> 00:31:46.753]  I'd be worried about that.
[00:31:46.753 --> 00:31:49.395]  I ain't worried because they know that they have nothing.
[00:31:49.395 --> 00:31:49.915]  Exactly.
[00:31:49.915 --> 00:31:52.757]  They went into overkill, which shows they're not confident.
[00:31:53.766 --> 00:31:58.467]  So one of the other aspects of an enemy, and this enemy that we are facing, is arrogance.
[00:31:58.467 --> 00:32:02.468]  Their arrogance because they just are so arrogant.
[00:32:02.468 --> 00:32:05.309]  And this is how evil operates, right?
[00:32:05.309 --> 00:32:14.351]  The arrogance of evil is something that is so profound, and it is something that we have to pay attention to.
[00:32:14.351 --> 00:32:16.772]  Well, we know from the Bible that's the big sin is pride.
[00:32:16.772 --> 00:32:17.872]  That's the devil's makeup.
[00:32:17.872 --> 00:32:18.212]  Right.
[00:32:19.011 --> 00:32:20.172]  Right, right.
[00:32:20.172 --> 00:32:25.816]  So we just can't look at these people and go, they're just a bunch of arrogant bastards.
[00:32:25.816 --> 00:32:33.322]  Their arrogance will be one of the main telegraphing features of what it is that they are going to do.
[00:32:33.322 --> 00:32:39.267]  So I go back to this potential cyber, because cyber is something that
[00:32:39.867 --> 00:32:45.230]  Few people understand, even fewer know what to do about it.
[00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:57.317]  If your phone shuts down, if the internet shuts down, you know, if you have your own servers, let's say, you know, if you're a media company and you have your own servers, you have your own ability to project, you have, I mean, little things.
[00:32:57.317 --> 00:32:59.618]  So here's a little thing that people aren't paying attention to.
[00:33:00.566 --> 00:33:05.750]  They're going to remove AM radios, AM radios from cars, right?
[00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:10.233]  The big car manufacturers, who are all woke corporations, they're taking AM radios out.
[00:33:10.233 --> 00:33:11.414]  They're going to stop.
[00:33:11.414 --> 00:33:18.680]  The Federal Communications Commission is going to start to minimize or limit the use of AM radio.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:26.566]  AM radio is one of the most powerful communications means in the world still, other than maybe a ham radio, and there's fewer and fewer.
[00:33:27.006 --> 00:33:28.987]  And by the way, they're doing a huge test.
[00:33:28.987 --> 00:33:30.969]  I know where you're going with this.
[00:33:30.969 --> 00:33:31.129]  Exactly.
[00:33:57.186 --> 00:34:00.628]  A.M., F.M., U.H.F., V.H.F., media didn't watch you.
[00:34:00.628 --> 00:34:04.530]  Now, by phasing out all the old broadcast systems, starting with A.M.
[00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:11.153]  and shortwave, and our military's moving even away from it, everything now is on the web, which makes it all targetable.
[00:34:11.153 --> 00:34:22.518]  I'm not a military mastermind like you, but common sense means our military should be always, 100 years from now, still back up shortwave, still back up A.M., still back up, you know, all those other secret systems that
[00:34:23.098 --> 00:34:28.630]  Transmitted to the Earth, but instead they're moving away, making us vulnerable is what you're saying, putting us on one system.
[00:34:29.684 --> 00:34:45.071]  The entirety of our country is being put in such a vulnerable spot right now, and this is going to continue to, you know, from their perspective, is going to continue to make progress to get to a place where we cannot control anything.
[00:34:45.071 --> 00:34:52.274]  We will not be able to control our phones, we will not be able to control, hell, the light switches in our home.
[00:34:52.274 --> 00:34:57.556]  I mean, I want people to realize, you know, they're going to call me nuts about this stuff, but I want people to realize that
[00:34:58.957 --> 00:35:02.798]  The sobering reality is that evil exists.
[00:35:02.798 --> 00:35:09.920]  And these people, when Klaus Schwab says and writes about that you're going to own nothing and be happy, he's not joking.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:10.941]  This is not a joke.
[00:35:10.941 --> 00:35:13.081]  This is a man that doesn't joke.
[00:35:13.081 --> 00:35:21.884]  This is a man who has his hands on every single major nation state on this planet, to include the United States of America.
[00:35:21.884 --> 00:35:24.165]  His circle of leaders
[00:35:25.085 --> 00:35:32.288]  Well, remember General Petraeus 12 years ago said, soon your dishwasher will be watching you and listening to you.
[00:35:32.288 --> 00:35:35.030]  Well, now that's been here a while.
[00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:36.310]  Right.
[00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.711]  We have something called the Internet of Things, right?
[00:35:38.711 --> 00:35:41.993]  People understand the Internet of Things, for those that know what I'm talking about.
[00:35:41.993 --> 00:35:48.676]  So, I go back to what are the potential things that could happen, right?
[00:35:48.676 --> 00:35:50.216]  And one of the ways in warfare
[00:35:51.826 --> 00:35:57.857]  You know, Sun Tzu used to say that, in fact, he wrote about it, and I've studied it for agnosia.
[00:35:59.045 --> 00:36:01.607]  But everything in war is deception.
[00:36:01.607 --> 00:36:03.989]  I want people to understand what I just said.
[00:36:03.989 --> 00:36:06.070]  Everything in war is deception.
[00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:07.951]  We are in a war right now.
[00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:14.116]  There are some physical components out there, clearly physical components over in Europe.
[00:36:14.116 --> 00:36:18.379]  There's clearly physical components still in Afghanistan, Iraq, you know, around the world.
[00:36:18.379 --> 00:36:22.141]  There's physical components in every single major city in this country.
[00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:24.903]  And it's called, you know, things like defund the police.
[00:36:24.903 --> 00:36:25.824]  The defund the police
[00:36:26.584 --> 00:36:34.906]  Oh, that's in the State Department memorandum 7277 from 1962 to disarm the police and then our military and only have a UN force.
[00:36:34.906 --> 00:36:35.907]  That's the official policy.
[00:36:45.808 --> 00:36:47.729]  Exactly.
[00:36:47.729 --> 00:36:53.891]  So I want people to understand that the rise and fall of nation states is very real.
[00:36:53.891 --> 00:36:55.251]  It's a fact of life.
[00:36:55.251 --> 00:36:58.252]  I joked the other day with some friends that I was with.
[00:36:58.252 --> 00:37:01.773]  I said, when was the last time you met anybody from Byzantine, from the Byzantine Empire?
[00:37:01.773 --> 00:37:03.854]  And they looked at me like I was cross-eyed.
[00:37:03.854 --> 00:37:05.935]  And I said, because they don't exist anymore.
[00:37:05.935 --> 00:37:08.255]  So the American Empire, let's say 250 years.
[00:37:10.516 --> 00:37:21.039]  So where are we in that sort of rise and decline of this nation, this beautiful experiment in democracy called a constitutional republic?
[00:37:21.039 --> 00:37:22.219]  Where are we?
[00:37:22.219 --> 00:37:26.020]  And I will tell you, these people are going to work overtime.
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.681]  And those are the ones that I just laid out to include those in our own government.
[00:37:29.681 --> 00:37:33.141]  I mean, you know, there's no way in the world that Joe Biden is in charge of anything.
[00:37:33.141 --> 00:37:34.462]  He can barely go to the bathroom.
[00:37:34.462 --> 00:37:35.482]  I mean, Jesus, this guy
[00:37:36.602 --> 00:37:40.044]  This guy can't walk up two stairs without help.
[00:37:40.044 --> 00:37:42.025]  So how did we get here?
[00:37:42.025 --> 00:37:54.290]  We got here because we've been complacent, we've been lazy, we've been apathetic about our political system, we've allowed a culture of corruption to just be
[00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:59.636]  I mean, just bleed into every single aspect of our country.
[00:37:59.636 --> 00:38:04.681]  And this is where I want to jump a little bit and talk about the Republican Conservative Party.
[00:38:04.681 --> 00:38:13.631]  That's exactly where I want to go, because we have the incestuous globalists double-dealing with the other power blocs, but then they're trying to degrade and demoralize the United States.
[00:38:14.545 --> 00:38:14.925]  I think so.
[00:38:30.939 --> 00:38:32.260]  That they will try to kill Trump.
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.122]  I think that's a very reasonable statement.
[00:38:34.122 --> 00:38:37.384]  I think that they're trying to outlaw their political opposition.
[00:38:37.384 --> 00:38:39.827]  They're trying to create a one-party state.
[00:38:39.827 --> 00:38:41.188]  Even Senator Josh Hawley gets that.
[00:38:41.188 --> 00:38:50.115]  So I see it positive that people realize how much trouble we're in, but is it a dollar short and a day late, or what can we do?
[00:38:50.115 --> 00:38:57.101]  Yeah, what you just said at the very last point, I hope that that's not a dollar short and a day late.
[00:38:57.101 --> 00:38:57.982]  I pray that we're not there.
[00:38:58.602 --> 00:39:02.868]  I think right now they're trying to kill Trump by narrative, right?
[00:39:02.868 --> 00:39:07.794]  I mean, the narrative is just constant, constant narrative, and it's been going on for years.
[00:39:07.794 --> 00:39:16.746]  And, you know, these latest indictments are just part of the narrative assassination, I would say, because of who he is and what he represents, which is a major, major
[00:39:17.823 --> 00:39:18.544]  I don't think so.
[00:39:37.172 --> 00:39:45.465]  I think the Secret Service that protects his life need to ramp it up, and they ought to actually be asking for more help.
[00:39:45.465 --> 00:39:47.708]  They should be asking for more help.
[00:39:47.708 --> 00:39:52.115]  As those of us that run in those same circles, we need to be doing the same thing.
[00:39:52.635 --> 00:40:10.545]  Because these people, they are not without that type of level of action, of activity, if they feel so threatened that what you're doing is going to stop their ability to be able to continue
[00:40:11.266 --> 00:40:13.007]  And I want the audience to get a sense of urgency because
[00:40:40.374 --> 00:40:43.316]  And I'm not a military trained tactician like you or a combat veteran.
[00:40:43.316 --> 00:40:46.638]  I'm just a veteran of 29 years fighting these people.
[00:40:46.638 --> 00:40:53.083]  And I see a mixture of arrogance, but that's hiding their desperation and the fact that they're all in.
[00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:55.765]  And I don't think people realize I can feel it.
[00:40:55.765 --> 00:40:56.785]  I can see it.
[00:40:56.785 --> 00:40:58.146]  Just what you just said, General.
[00:40:58.146 --> 00:41:00.348]  I have never had such a sense of urgency.
[00:41:00.348 --> 00:41:01.628]  That's why I have you here.
[00:41:01.628 --> 00:41:02.189]  What can we do?
[00:41:03.345 --> 00:41:09.696]  Yeah, and again, I appreciate everything you've done for years.
[00:41:09.696 --> 00:41:11.699]  Yeah, there's a sense of urgency that we all need.
[00:41:14.406 --> 00:41:16.627]  A weakness of mine is anxiety.
[00:41:16.627 --> 00:41:17.628]  I get anxious sometimes.
[00:41:17.628 --> 00:41:23.431]  I wake up, like I woke up this morning at about 3 o'clock in the morning and I started reading and writing.
[00:41:23.431 --> 00:41:23.951]  Me too.
[00:41:23.951 --> 00:41:27.713]  I woke up at 3.15 and was just, I don't have the anxiety during the day.
[00:41:27.713 --> 00:41:30.234]  I wake up because my brain's working while I'm asleep.
[00:41:30.234 --> 00:41:31.115]  I went to bed about 10.
[00:41:31.115 --> 00:41:33.796]  I woke up at 3 and I was like, I've got to do something.
[00:41:34.941 --> 00:41:35.562]  Exactly.
[00:41:35.562 --> 00:41:45.937]  And so to me, I want people to, you know, I have a platform, you have a platform, I have a national platform and an international platform, and I'm going to continue to use it.
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:48.480]  I'm going to speak out.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.341]  I'm going to move around this country.
[00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:52.461]  I'm going to get in the faces of these people.
[00:41:52.461 --> 00:41:54.601]  I'm going to let them know that we got your number.
[00:41:54.601 --> 00:41:59.062]  I'm going to let Americans know that we're with you and you've got to be with us.
[00:41:59.062 --> 00:42:01.583]  You've got to stand behind us.
[00:42:01.583 --> 00:42:05.343]  There will be those of us that will be that pointy end of the spear.
[00:42:05.343 --> 00:42:06.824]  But I need every American now.
[00:42:06.824 --> 00:42:13.045]  I need every single person to get into their communities and to get into the faces of their local politicians.
[00:42:13.445 --> 00:42:20.750]  I mean, that's why we've seen particularly women, Alex, getting in the faces of these school boards around the country.
[00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:26.754]  You know, we haven't really talked about the educational immersion that they're taking our children through.
[00:42:26.754 --> 00:42:30.277]  And this is actually part of the Chinese plan, too.
[00:42:30.277 --> 00:42:35.441]  So, you know, people don't know that in 1949, when Mao came to power, he created a 100-year
[00:42:36.301 --> 00:42:37.342]  We're good to go.
[00:42:48.809 --> 00:42:58.133]  He came on board, declared himself president for life, and he is going to move at a pace that's much faster, because he knows he's not going to be around in 2049.
[00:42:58.133 --> 00:43:00.114]  So he's going to make it happen by 2029.
[00:43:00.114 --> 00:43:03.116]  And I think you hit the key here, though.
[00:43:03.116 --> 00:43:05.497]  People have to know who the enemies are.
[00:43:05.497 --> 00:43:11.540]  And I am seeing a real acceleration in the learning curve.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:21.873]  I mean, if I tried to list all the people now that sound, quote, radical like you and I, but we're not radical, we just are aware, that's got to really scare... I mean, even James Wood sounds like General Flynn now.
[00:43:21.873 --> 00:43:24.176]  Russell Brand, Tucker Carlson.
[00:43:24.176 --> 00:43:25.458]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[00:43:25.458 --> 00:43:26.379]  RFK Jr.
[00:43:26.379 --> 00:43:26.560]  I mean...
[00:43:27.719 --> 00:43:28.460]  Right, RFK.
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.001]  So, RFK Jr.
[00:43:30.001 --> 00:43:32.803]  And the other thing is, don't listen to Alex Jones.
[00:43:32.803 --> 00:43:34.504]  Don't listen to Mike Flynn.
[00:43:34.504 --> 00:43:40.669]  Go and do your own damn critical research, and you're going to find that we're only scratching the surface.
[00:43:40.669 --> 00:43:40.989]  Exactly.
[00:43:40.989 --> 00:43:43.291]  Nothing that we've said is stuff that we're making up.
[00:43:43.291 --> 00:43:47.734]  This is stuff that we're just scratching the surface of what these people are capable of doing.
[00:43:47.734 --> 00:43:49.636]  So, where's the Republican Party?
[00:43:49.636 --> 00:43:50.616]  Where's the leadership?
[00:43:50.616 --> 00:43:51.517]  It's non-existent.
[00:43:51.517 --> 00:43:52.538]  Non-existent.
[00:43:52.538 --> 00:43:54.860]  So, where's the impeachment of Biden?
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:55.300]  Where is it?
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:57.380]  Right.
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:07.245]  Well, I know that one congressman has put in impeachment proceedings to initiate them, but he did that like almost a month ago, Alex.
[00:44:07.245 --> 00:44:10.246]  And yet, McCarthy is still on vacation.
[00:44:10.246 --> 00:44:12.107]  He's still got the entire house on vacation.
[00:44:12.107 --> 00:44:13.167]  So they're going to come back.
[00:44:13.167 --> 00:44:19.630]  Well, MTG, I should have announced it, is in the studio tomorrow night, and she says that it's going to be introduced the next two weeks.
[00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:25.073]  She says she's got his... I'm kind of breaking news here, but let's hope that's the case.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:36.346]  Yeah, well, so a guy by the name of Greg Stubbe, Congressman Stubbe from Florida, he did introduce impeachment proceedings already, and he did it about four weeks ago.
[00:44:36.346 --> 00:44:41.109]  So now it's like, I was like jumping through my skin when I heard that four weeks ago.
[00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:45.351]  And I was like, great, let's get all these guys back, guys and gals back to work.
[00:44:45.351 --> 00:44:47.372]  And let's start the impeachment proceedings now.
[00:44:47.372 --> 00:44:50.794]  You know, you take a week, take a week's break, take a take a four days.
[00:44:50.794 --> 00:44:52.255]  Yeah, we got to go on offense.
[00:44:52.255 --> 00:44:53.316]  And instead, it's not work.
[00:44:54.557 --> 00:44:57.468]  We've got to go on offense.
[00:44:57.468 --> 00:44:59.495]  We have got to get off of our heels.
[00:44:59.495 --> 00:45:00.237]  We have got to start
[00:45:01.108 --> 00:45:10.657]  The only way we're going to score, the only way we're going to win is by being on offense, by scoring, by getting over that line.
[00:45:10.657 --> 00:45:17.083]  We know what Nancy Pelosi was able to do in the first 30 days of her previous time as Speaker.
[00:45:17.083 --> 00:45:19.705]  She had 500 subpoenas out to people for her fake January 6th
[00:45:26.713 --> 00:45:28.294]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:45:28.294 --> 00:45:30.636]  Where are we?
[00:45:30.636 --> 00:45:35.821]  This speaker, McCarthy, as far as I'm concerned, is a rhino establishment figurehead.
[00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:40.072]  And he doesn't deserve to be called speaker.
[00:45:40.072 --> 00:45:42.094]  No, I totally agree, and we should expand on that.
[00:45:42.094 --> 00:45:44.035]  Obviously, they're scared of the Justice Department.
[00:45:44.035 --> 00:45:45.055]  They're intimidated.
[00:45:45.055 --> 00:45:45.796]  He should be removed.
[00:45:45.796 --> 00:45:47.397]  He doesn't take action.
[00:45:47.397 --> 00:45:49.658]  But that's another great example.
[00:45:49.658 --> 00:45:52.300]  We need to see the impeachment of Merrick Garland.
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:57.763]  They've caught him meeting secretly with Jack Smith, meeting at the White House with Jack Smith.
[00:45:57.763 --> 00:46:00.225]  They've caught him covering up the Hunter Biden stuff.
[00:46:00.225 --> 00:46:01.846]  We have all the whistleblowers.
[00:46:01.846 --> 00:46:03.067]  Impeach the son of a bitch!
[00:46:03.905 --> 00:46:04.546]  Yeah.
[00:46:04.546 --> 00:46:08.268]  So I just want to take a minute to talk about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:46:08.268 --> 00:46:08.369]  Yes.
[00:46:08.369 --> 00:46:17.896]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., number one, they won't provide him Secret Service, which tells you everything that they plan on potentially doing to that guy.
[00:46:17.896 --> 00:46:26.683]  Number one, or number two, the Kennedy, every time I hear him, I'm like, Jesus, Kennedy, you sound like you're an America first guy.
[00:46:26.683 --> 00:46:32.868]  You sound like a damn, an American who, you sound like either you're old school Democrat
[00:46:33.328 --> 00:46:40.110]  And you're right there in the center of the country, or you're on the conservative side because of the way you're speaking.
[00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:43.852]  And I would say that even some of the things that he's written about.
[00:46:43.852 --> 00:46:47.833]  So I like him, and I know him.
[00:46:47.833 --> 00:46:50.174]  And when I see guys like him,
[00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:56.882]  I mean, he gives me hope because the Democrats, the Democrats now are the Marxist party, right?
[00:46:56.882 --> 00:47:02.030]  So the Democrats are not going to do a debate with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.710]  Why?
[00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:07.397]  Because he represents something that they fear, which is honesty and the truth.
[00:47:08.081 --> 00:47:12.242]  Why are they going after Donald Trump so hard?
[00:47:12.242 --> 00:47:15.723]  Because he represents honesty, and he represents the truth.
[00:47:15.723 --> 00:47:36.187]  And yeah, you're showing clips of not only his father being assassinated, but his uncle being assassinated—never mind Martin Luther King Jr., never mind Malcolm X. One of the statements that Malcolm X said is, anybody that calls themselves a liberal Democrat, he said,
[00:47:37.228 --> 00:47:38.389]  Be very careful.
[00:47:38.389 --> 00:47:39.630]  He talks about liberals, right?
[00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:42.392]  He says, be very careful about somebody who says they're liberal.
[00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:45.755]  And then a couple of days later, when he gave that speech, he was dead.
[00:47:45.755 --> 00:47:46.755]  He was assassinated.
[00:47:46.755 --> 00:47:55.722]  So, you know, at that time in our history, physical assassinations were much easier to get away with.
[00:47:55.722 --> 00:47:59.405]  And then, of course, you could hide everything and classify it or it's under investigation.
[00:48:00.049 --> 00:48:17.923]  Now, physical assassinations would be very, very difficult to get away with because everybody's got a damn camera, you know, but... That's why they assassinate you now with lawfare and lies, but I really feel and see that's their desperation button is, I see political assassination coming roaring back.
[00:48:17.923 --> 00:48:20.785]  That's, and my gut's never wrong, General.
[00:48:20.785 --> 00:48:27.630]  Yeah, boy, you know, I mean, this is the time and I hope it is because I hate to think that, but I will tell you that
[00:48:29.288 --> 00:48:33.442]  These people are not going to wake up tomorrow morning, Alex.
[00:48:34.475 --> 00:48:41.118]  I'm talking about these people, the World Economic Forum or the White House.
[00:48:41.118 --> 00:48:42.639]  They're not going to wake up and go, you know what?
[00:48:42.639 --> 00:48:45.601]  We've screwed the American people so bad.
[00:48:45.601 --> 00:48:48.302]  Let's turn the energy spigots back on.
[00:48:48.302 --> 00:48:52.684]  Let's get rid of this cultural bullshit inside of our education system.
[00:48:52.684 --> 00:48:53.965]  Let's stop with the CRT.
[00:48:53.965 --> 00:48:55.706]  Let's stop with the drag queen hour.
[00:48:55.706 --> 00:48:57.887]  Let's fund the police.
[00:48:57.887 --> 00:48:59.508]  Let's go ahead and build a wall.
[00:48:59.508 --> 00:49:01.108]  Let's go ahead and stop this invasion.
[00:49:01.108 --> 00:49:02.129]  Let's get the fentanyl.
[00:49:02.329 --> 00:49:10.635]  Yeah, they could be in charge of a big win and have dominations of American culture and be ten times more powerful, but they have, they have a needle dick.
[00:49:10.635 --> 00:49:12.137]  Why do the globalists hate us so much?
[00:49:12.137 --> 00:49:14.719]  Why do they have it out for us?
[00:49:14.719 --> 00:49:23.005]  They hate us because they hate just authentic, honest people who they cannot control.
[00:49:23.005 --> 00:49:23.566]  Yep.
[00:49:23.566 --> 00:49:26.668]  And I, and I, and I, you know, I mean, yours truly here.
[00:49:26.668 --> 00:49:31.492]  It's like when I, in my, when I was in the tail end of my military time,
[00:49:32.719 --> 00:49:35.202]  This is public.
[00:49:35.202 --> 00:49:50.935]  One of the reasons why I was told to leave basically a year early from a job that normally would be three years was because I wouldn't toe the line for the talking points that ISIS was on the run, that al-Qaeda was on the run, and no longer a threat.
[00:49:50.935 --> 00:49:53.517]  I just wouldn't toe the line because that wasn't the truth.
[00:49:53.517 --> 00:50:00.283]  When they offer you things, they shine this light at the end of the hall, and the light is a very easy light to grab hold of.
[00:50:00.683 --> 00:50:02.024]  Hey, don't worry about it.
[00:50:02.024 --> 00:50:03.304]  You know, you're going to get taken care of.
[00:50:03.304 --> 00:50:03.944]  Wait till you get out.
[00:50:03.944 --> 00:50:06.045]  You're going to be put on this board, that board.
[00:50:06.045 --> 00:50:08.326]  You're going to be given all kinds of things.
[00:50:08.326 --> 00:50:11.727]  And you're going to, you know, you're going to be taken care of, right?
[00:50:11.727 --> 00:50:13.168]  I just, I'm like, that's bullshit.
[00:50:13.168 --> 00:50:14.969]  We're talking about people's lives here.
[00:50:14.969 --> 00:50:18.310]  You know, we're talking about- Of course, you were vindicated right after you warned that.
[00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:21.051]  Al Qaeda through ISIS had a huge resurgence.
[00:50:22.435 --> 00:50:36.548]  Oh my God, it was in 24 or 26 countries, if I remember right at the time, and they were exploding all over Africa, all over the Middle East, and all over Central Asia, as well as here in this country.
[00:50:36.548 --> 00:50:42.414]  And that's one of the things that the Obama administration didn't want to do, so didn't want to talk about, and didn't want to have to admit to, right?
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.902]  They want this country, and they're not going to wake up.
[00:50:47.902 --> 00:50:49.843]  They're going to continue to triple down.
[00:50:49.843 --> 00:50:53.905]  We're going to see more of this same stuff.
[00:50:53.905 --> 00:50:59.769]  You showed the pictures of the mosquitoes, the Bill Gates Foundation spraying mosquitoes.
[00:50:59.769 --> 00:51:01.210]  We're already talking about masks.
[00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:02.050]  I think so.
[00:51:17.942 --> 00:51:20.784]  And isn't the resistance to that an example of victory?
[00:51:20.784 --> 00:51:24.068]  In the few minutes we have left, any other key points you'd like to add?
[00:51:24.068 --> 00:51:26.790]  My big concern is false flags.
[00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:30.634]  In your research, obviously a cyber attack can be blamed on somebody.
[00:51:30.634 --> 00:51:33.537]  They're trying to say all the conservatives are white supremacists.
[00:51:33.537 --> 00:51:37.581]  I'm worried they'll attack a black church or a college.
[00:51:37.581 --> 00:51:39.783]  They're really pushing that narrative.
[00:51:40.924 --> 00:51:42.725]  What do you see in your false flag wheelhouse?
[00:51:42.725 --> 00:51:44.966]  And I want to get you back on soon, because I'm going to read the book.
[00:51:44.966 --> 00:51:47.247]  I read your last book, How to Fight AI.
[00:51:47.247 --> 00:51:49.047]  Tell us about that.
[00:51:49.047 --> 00:51:50.108]  Yeah.
[00:51:50.108 --> 00:52:04.493]  So one thing on false flags, it's very easy to train a militia of a bunch of white dudes up in the, you know, up in the boonie somewhere in this country, and then get them out there to do something and make sure that, you know, that they're all taken care of, right?
[00:52:04.713 --> 00:52:11.356]  It's easy to do that and make it appear as though it's some white, you know, Christian national Nazi group, right?
[00:52:11.356 --> 00:52:14.877]  And then they blame, and they do something— And again, Biden's telegraphing.
[00:52:14.877 --> 00:52:19.919]  He says the number one threat is white terrorists with almost no—it's almost nonexistent.
[00:52:20.782 --> 00:52:23.544]  Yeah, so we'll expand on that.
[00:52:23.544 --> 00:52:24.165]  We got a few minutes.
[00:52:24.165 --> 00:52:25.366]  Expand on that.
[00:52:25.366 --> 00:52:29.309]  Well, yeah, I mean, so these are easy things to do, folks.
[00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:31.631]  These are these false flags, we call them.
[00:52:31.631 --> 00:52:32.972]  These are easy things to create.
[00:52:32.972 --> 00:52:38.096]  Now, if you have another element called a bunch of illegals,
[00:52:38.716 --> 00:52:42.399]  So nobody's looking for him in, you know, hometown USA, right?
[00:52:42.399 --> 00:52:45.221]  Nobody's looking for their brother or their uncle.
[00:52:45.221 --> 00:52:47.843]  It's just a bunch of illegals that are being trained.
[00:52:47.843 --> 00:52:53.887]  And we have people coming into this, coming into America from like 165, 168 countries.
[00:52:53.887 --> 00:53:05.095]  Do you remember just six months ago, they had three illegal groups in Texas commit mass shootings, and they tried to say white supremacists did it, but it didn't work, so they shut it down.
[00:53:05.095 --> 00:53:05.756]  Is that what you're getting at?
[00:53:06.696 --> 00:53:08.657]  Yes, that's exactly what I'm getting at.
[00:53:08.657 --> 00:53:09.797]  And so they're going to try.
[00:53:09.797 --> 00:53:11.518]  They'll test.
[00:53:11.518 --> 00:53:12.958]  They'll test the waters.
[00:53:12.958 --> 00:53:15.019]  And you're going to see these false flags.
[00:53:15.019 --> 00:53:17.400]  We have got to be able to analyze them quickly.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:23.182]  We've got to be able to, if we still have access to the internet, we have to be able to get the word out quickly.
[00:53:23.182 --> 00:53:29.284]  We've got to use the influencers that we have to say, hey, don't fall into this trap that they want.
[00:53:29.284 --> 00:53:30.425]  They want this trap of
[00:53:30.905 --> 00:53:36.392]  They want it to where the American people start to become violent.
[00:53:36.392 --> 00:53:39.535]  This is nonviolence.
[00:53:39.535 --> 00:53:46.784]  We have got to be so smart about what they are going to try to lure Americans into doing.
[00:53:46.784 --> 00:53:48.406]  And this is part of this false flag.
[00:53:48.886 --> 00:54:00.252]  Now, if they also do cyber attacks, simultaneous, right, at the same time, where they're shutting down, and they can segment the Internet, they don't just have to shut down the entire Internet, they can segment the Internet.
[00:54:00.252 --> 00:54:02.353]  They can only send this to their sites, exactly.
[00:54:02.353 --> 00:54:08.837]  They're going to hit with a cyber attack, claim it's the Russians, they've already said the right-wing Trump's going to work with the Russians to shut the web off.
[00:54:08.837 --> 00:54:18.102]  They shut it down to shut us up, and that's why they've been trying to get rid of every local talk show host that's on AM and FM that's a patriot, is because they're still worried about those systems.
[00:54:19.574 --> 00:54:24.040]  In the world of AI, they could use false videos of you, of me, of Trump, of high-profile people
[00:54:34.974 --> 00:54:36.715]  It's making statements, right?
[00:54:36.715 --> 00:54:40.157]  Crazy statements, or making statements that sound legitimate.
[00:54:40.157 --> 00:54:43.219]  And it looks just like this background.
[00:54:43.219 --> 00:54:50.143]  So a Trump mom goes off at a black college, and it's Alex Jones or Trump or General Flynn saying, good job, blow more stuff up.
[00:54:50.143 --> 00:54:50.784]  We never said that.
[00:54:51.144 --> 00:54:53.366]  Exactly, exactly, exactly.
[00:54:53.366 --> 00:55:09.076]  And now what you have to do is, you're on the defense, and now you've got to go out there and fight some media thing, and you've got ABC, NBC, CBL, you've got all the big major networks, the cable news networks that are going, did you see what General Flynn said?
[00:55:09.076 --> 00:55:10.277]  Did you see what Alex Jones said?
[00:55:10.277 --> 00:55:12.638]  Did you see what these people are talking about?
[00:55:12.638 --> 00:55:15.700]  And it's none of that, right?
[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:16.681]  It's none of that.
[00:55:16.681 --> 00:55:18.002]  The whole thing is fake.
[00:55:18.002 --> 00:55:19.743]  The whole thing is a poser.
[00:55:20.163 --> 00:55:20.323]  Right?
[00:55:20.323 --> 00:55:20.983]  It's a poser.
[00:55:20.983 --> 00:55:22.404]  Well, here's a microcosm.
[00:55:22.404 --> 00:55:28.725]  I'm there on January 6, trying to get everybody over where Trump's stage was on the Northeast side by the Supreme Court.
[00:55:28.725 --> 00:55:31.246]  And I get up and say, I got thousands to not go in.
[00:55:31.246 --> 00:55:33.167]  Wall Street Journal still ran headlines.
[00:55:33.167 --> 00:55:34.507]  I said, attack the Capitol.
[00:55:34.507 --> 00:55:36.367]  Now, thank God we still had the Internet.
[00:55:36.367 --> 00:55:38.848]  I was banned, but other people got the video out.
[00:55:38.848 --> 00:55:39.668]  They had to retract.
[00:55:39.668 --> 00:55:42.149]  But if we're not online, they'll be able to do that.
[00:55:43.263 --> 00:55:52.470]  They'll be able to do that, and they will be given access to the emergency broadcast system by this administration.
[00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:53.751]  I guarantee that.
[00:55:53.751 --> 00:56:03.399]  So if we start to hear about the emergency broadcast system being tested and used, I really think that the real potential exists.
[00:56:03.399 --> 00:56:05.841]  And this is in Klaus Schwab's words, right?
[00:56:06.607 --> 00:56:06.687]  No.
[00:56:27.319 --> 00:56:30.161]  No, it's the corporate intelligence agency that's taking over every aspect.
[00:56:47.894 --> 00:56:50.535]  General Flynn, incredible 45 minutes with us.
[00:56:50.535 --> 00:56:51.876]  GeneralFlynn.com.
[00:56:51.876 --> 00:56:53.597]  Everybody should get How to Fight AI.
[00:56:53.597 --> 00:56:54.257]  I'm going to read it.
[00:56:54.257 --> 00:56:56.759]  I'm going to go order it today.
[00:56:56.759 --> 00:56:58.459]  GeneralFlynn.com.
[00:56:58.459 --> 00:56:59.640]  Thank you so much.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.121]  We now have Joe Biggs on the line from prison.
[00:57:02.121 --> 00:57:05.443]  Would you like to do 60 seconds before we go to him, just on your view on what just happened?
[00:57:09.379 --> 00:57:12.822]  Yeah, I do.
[00:57:12.822 --> 00:57:19.787]  I mean, I think that what's going on with our people that are being held as political prisoners, this is madness.
[00:57:19.787 --> 00:57:20.747]  This is sheer madness.
[00:57:23.129 --> 00:57:27.354]  I mean, these people are out there protecting the life of babies, and the unborn, and the Planned Parenthood.
[00:57:27.354 --> 00:57:29.436]  They're actually killing babies after the fact, and they knew it!
[00:57:29.436 --> 00:57:29.937]  After they were born!
[00:57:44.352 --> 00:57:45.573]  Brought into this world.
[00:57:45.573 --> 00:57:49.254]  I mean, they're going to put these people in jail for upwards of 10 years.
[00:57:49.254 --> 00:57:54.256]  These are political issues, political prisoners, and we have got to stand against this.
[00:57:54.256 --> 00:57:57.837]  And trust me, this is why they don't want us back in power.
[00:57:57.837 --> 00:58:04.840]  This is why they're fighting tooth and nail to keep Trump out and to keep guys like me from going back into government to help him.
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:08.181]  Because I know Trump will pardon people like Joe Biggs, there's no doubt.
[00:58:08.181 --> 00:58:11.462]  GeneralFlynn.com, God bless you and thank you so much, General.
[00:58:11.462 --> 00:58:11.903]  Absolutely.
[00:58:11.903 --> 00:58:12.383]  God bless.
[00:58:12.383 --> 00:58:12.703]  Thank you.
[00:58:13.416 --> 00:58:14.436]  All right, wow.
[00:58:14.436 --> 00:58:22.059]  Now, let's go to Joe Biggs, who was just wrongfully convicted and sentenced to 17 years in prison.
[00:58:22.059 --> 00:58:31.003]  Former InfoWars reporter, totally innocent, charged with terrorism, terrorism sentencing for being there when
[00:58:33.723 --> 00:58:35.964]  Ray Epps broke through the fence.
[00:58:35.964 --> 00:58:37.444]  This is insane.
[00:58:37.444 --> 00:58:42.585]  Joe, I love you, brother, and you're a political prisoner, and we appreciate you.
[00:58:42.585 --> 00:58:52.528]  I know you only get 15 minutes per call, and you've got a call back at 15 again, so we've got about 12 minutes for you before they hang up on you, then we'll be waiting for you to come back on again in about 30 minutes.
[00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:54.289]  But Joe, how are you holding up?
[00:58:54.289 --> 00:58:56.729]  And you've got the floor.
[00:58:56.729 --> 00:58:57.870]  It's all right.
[00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:58.950]  My heart hurts.
[00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:00.210]  This is ridiculous.
[00:59:00.210 --> 00:59:02.451]  They said that shaking a fence was pantomime.
[00:59:03.195 --> 00:59:15.639]  The judge told me that, and they want to send a message to Americans that if you go to these events, if you are part of political groups, they're going to throw you in prison for a long time.
[00:59:15.639 --> 00:59:16.719]  They want you scared.
[00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:18.260]  They don't want you to go out and vote.
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:23.121]  They want people scared before it's time to vote, and that's why all this heat's happening right now.
[00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:24.262]  You know, this is ridiculous.
[00:59:24.262 --> 00:59:27.203]  We went there that day with no plan, with nothing.
[00:59:27.203 --> 00:59:31.004]  We were there like every other American, but it's because we're a political group.
[00:59:31.468 --> 00:59:38.554]  You know, we knew that there was going to be a hit on us as soon as Joe Biden mentioned us in the first presidential debate.
[00:59:38.554 --> 00:59:43.838]  I knew that there was something going on with this, and sure enough, even Enrique called it.
[00:59:43.838 --> 00:59:46.960]  They're going to put us in chains, and sure enough, they have.
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:55.707]  You know, we went through a long, drawn-out trial, five months, and not once did the FBI ever have proof of a plan.
[00:59:55.707 --> 00:59:57.708]  There was no intelligence of a plan.
[00:59:57.708 --> 00:59:59.450]  Not one of the rats that came forward.
[01:00:00.115 --> 01:00:01.455]  Um, said that there was a plan.
[01:00:01.455 --> 01:00:07.517]  Everyone said that there was zero plan of anything happening that day by us.
[01:00:07.517 --> 01:00:16.479]  And yet they got us for a conspiracy, um, to plan this, uh, uh, they said we had this meeting of the mind without ever actually saying anything.
[01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:20.540]  And it happened on the fly at the first breach.
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:23.121]  So apparently we all had this telekinesis power.
[01:00:23.121 --> 01:00:27.602]  We all agreed that from there on out, when this first, you know, fence went down and everyone walked forward,
[01:00:28.171 --> 01:00:31.053]  That we were all going to stop the certification of the election.
[01:00:31.053 --> 01:00:34.155]  And that's what they got the jury to say.
[01:00:34.155 --> 01:00:42.041]  And the jury would have convicted us of sorcery and witchcraft and murder if that was up to vote on.
[01:00:42.041 --> 01:00:42.882]  Well, Joe, you're right.
[01:00:42.882 --> 01:00:45.123]  This is the Salem Witch Trials 10.0.
[01:00:45.123 --> 01:00:47.725]  And what do you make of Ray Epps?
[01:00:47.725 --> 01:00:52.588]  He was there actually saying, go in the Capitol and picking up signs and ramming into police.
[01:00:52.588 --> 01:00:54.550]  But he's the little darling that must be protected.
[01:00:55.814 --> 01:00:59.696]  Well, this is the interesting thing about the trial.
[01:00:59.696 --> 01:01:02.757]  They altered evidence.
[01:01:02.757 --> 01:01:03.937]  There was witness tampering.
[01:01:03.937 --> 01:01:06.959]  There was witness intimidation by the FBI.
[01:01:06.959 --> 01:01:10.780]  They rigged this to a point where we had nothing that we could do.
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:17.944]  They only allowed in a video of a fence that goes down in front of me, in my area.
[01:01:17.944 --> 01:01:19.644]  And there's no video of me breaking the fence.
[01:01:19.644 --> 01:01:21.345]  There's a video of my hand on the fence.
[01:01:21.707 --> 01:01:27.470]  Then my hand comes off the fence and then later on the fence breaks after other people have grabbed it and ripped it.
[01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:29.530]  But they only showed that video.
[01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:32.612]  The real video... Hey, well they charged Owen.
[01:01:32.612 --> 01:01:35.253]  Owen is up for sentencing in two weeks.
[01:01:35.253 --> 01:01:38.494]  One of your fellow reporters and friends.
[01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:41.616]  And they said he should have known the fences had been knocked down.
[01:01:41.616 --> 01:01:44.257]  So just because he walked onto the property they charged him.
[01:01:44.257 --> 01:01:46.278]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:01:46.278 --> 01:01:51.120]  So the fence actually goes down in front of Ray F. But the video that the government gets
[01:01:51.676 --> 01:01:57.577]  To be allowed in, and the judge allowed in, shows a green glitch where the fence goes down first.
[01:01:57.577 --> 01:02:05.359]  You can't see all the people rushing up on the stage, and it only shows the fence breaking around the area that we're standing at, me and my buddy.
[01:02:05.359 --> 01:02:13.100]  So, it glitches out the part where it's in front of Ray Epps, where all the people are surging, and then they go in front of the judge and go, look, see, these guys are the first ones that broke it.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:18.842]  These guys are the ones that broke the fence and led the charge to the Capitol, and that is not the truth.
[01:02:18.842 --> 01:02:19.902]  That is not what happened.
[01:02:21.275 --> 01:02:23.036]  And videos will come out.
[01:02:23.036 --> 01:02:24.337]  This is insane.
[01:02:24.337 --> 01:02:28.279]  And they want to take me and put me in jail for the rest of my life.
[01:02:28.279 --> 01:02:29.920]  You know, I'm about to turn 40.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.821]  17 years.
[01:02:30.821 --> 01:02:32.842]  I mean, like, really, what am I going to do when I get out?
[01:02:32.842 --> 01:02:34.563]  You know, this is insane.
[01:02:34.563 --> 01:02:36.144]  There's no way that this can stick.
[01:02:36.144 --> 01:02:37.345]  This is a travesty.
[01:02:37.345 --> 01:02:42.888]  To say that the shaking of a fence, my putting a hand on a fence, is tantamount to terrorism.
[01:02:42.888 --> 01:02:46.370]  They're putting me in the same category as Osama bin Laden.
[01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:54.289]  So obviously you're going to appeal this, but let's talk about how we support you and your daughter and your family.
[01:02:54.289 --> 01:02:55.910]  FreeJoeBiggs.com.
[01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:58.012]  And I'm told you've only got 15 minutes until they cut you off.
[01:02:58.012 --> 01:03:01.154]  Are you going to be able to call back in, or how does that work?
[01:03:01.154 --> 01:03:03.676]  Do people see through the fact that you're a political prisoner?
[01:03:15.911 --> 01:03:20.654]  Everywhere I go, I can tell you that everywhere I go, people are praying for me.
[01:03:20.654 --> 01:03:25.297]  Every officer I meet puts their head down and they go, I can't believe this is happening to you, son.
[01:03:25.297 --> 01:03:26.477]  Every U.S.
[01:03:26.477 --> 01:03:27.438]  Marshal has done that.
[01:03:27.438 --> 01:03:33.221]  The only people who don't give a flying, you know, F about what's happening to me are the people that are in the FBI for the most part.
[01:03:33.221 --> 01:03:42.827]  There are some good, I'm not going to get you wrong, but the FBI for the most part, those are the evil, stinky, you know, conniving scoundrels that want to just see us thrown in jail for the rest of our life.
[01:03:42.827 --> 01:03:43.447]  But the U.S.
[01:03:43.447 --> 01:03:45.028]  Marshals, the Air Marshals, the police,
[01:03:45.627 --> 01:03:47.908]  Well, it's the arrogance of the globalist that has done this.
[01:03:47.908 --> 01:03:51.369]  And have you not seen your support supercharged, I'm guessing, since all the indictments against Trump?
[01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:16.623]  It's hard to see with the support in here, you know?
[01:04:16.623 --> 01:04:20.425]  Like, you know, I'm limited on what it is I can and can't see, but I hear about it.
[01:04:20.425 --> 01:04:22.226]  You know, I get messages and stuff like that.
[01:04:22.226 --> 01:04:25.808]  I hear that there is support, but you know, it's really hard.
[01:04:25.808 --> 01:04:30.071]  You know, they really constrict what I'm able to see from inside.
[01:04:30.071 --> 01:04:31.031]  Where are you right now?
[01:04:31.031 --> 01:04:32.412]  Where are you going?
[01:04:32.412 --> 01:04:34.573]  And obviously you need money for appeal.
[01:04:34.573 --> 01:04:35.814]  People say, we're always asking for money.
[01:04:35.814 --> 01:04:37.575]  Yeah, we're in a war against the clubless, folks.
[01:04:37.575 --> 01:04:38.796]  How do people support you, Joe?
[01:04:40.302 --> 01:04:41.483]  Well, right now I'm at the D.C.
[01:04:41.483 --> 01:04:43.764]  Jail, what a lot of people call the D.C.
[01:04:43.764 --> 01:04:44.344]  Gulag.
[01:04:44.344 --> 01:04:49.187]  This is the one spot that had a, you know, we're treating prisoners for that at one point.
[01:04:49.187 --> 01:04:55.750]  Owen said when he was there that he would wake up and literally covered in roaches eating his skin.
[01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:59.012]  Yeah, that's how it was in the building where they first originally had people.
[01:04:59.012 --> 01:05:02.113]  Now we're in what's called the CTF, and it's a lot nicer.
[01:05:02.113 --> 01:05:04.194]  It's not as bad, but the food is horrible.
[01:05:04.194 --> 01:05:05.775]  Like, you can't eat the food here.
[01:05:05.775 --> 01:05:09.337]  It is not edible in any kind of way whatsoever.
[01:05:09.993 --> 01:05:14.818]  Um, you know, to your second point, if you really want to help out, you know, I need money to help support my daughter.
[01:05:14.818 --> 01:05:17.460]  You know, they have taken away my military retirement.
[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:20.823]  It's as if, it's as if I never even served in the military.
[01:05:20.823 --> 01:05:29.692]  Uh, you know, the prosecutor gets up and starts, you know, before sentencing, he goes, I just want everybody to know that I don't want to take away from Joe Biggs the fact that he's an American hero and that he served our country, but...
[01:05:30.461 --> 01:05:33.542]  Basically him touching that fence is tantamount to terrorism.
[01:05:33.542 --> 01:05:39.524]  Um, his hand touching that fence was the same as an explosion going off and sending shrapnel through bodies and killing people.
[01:05:39.524 --> 01:05:40.404]  Um, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:05:40.404 --> 01:05:43.505]  And the judge has now said that in the Trump January 6th case.
[01:05:43.505 --> 01:05:47.226]  She compared it to 9-11 and the Boston bombing.
[01:05:47.226 --> 01:05:47.846]  Yeah.
[01:05:47.846 --> 01:05:49.906]  So if you really want to help me out, I need the help.
[01:05:49.906 --> 01:05:52.587]  I got, I mean, the pills case, it takes years.
[01:05:52.587 --> 01:05:54.748]  You know, I'm not getting out anytime soon.
[01:05:54.748 --> 01:05:59.089]  Um, I've already been in for three years almost, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm about to come up with my three years.
[01:05:59.514 --> 01:06:03.537]  Of that three years, I've been in solitary confinement for a year and a half.
[01:06:03.537 --> 01:06:08.040]  Um, you know, and I'm, you know, praise be to God that I haven't lost my mind from that.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:13.404]  Everybody wonders how I can still keep, um, you know, my sanity and how I'm still able to communicate with people.
[01:06:13.404 --> 01:06:26.414]  Well, I saw the left make fun of you that you cried when they said 17 years, but I mean, obviously you're not 17 years and you've been given this evil tyranny and can't see your daughter.
[01:06:26.414 --> 01:06:27.475]  I would cry too.
[01:06:27.475 --> 01:06:28.816]  They are sick, evil people.
[01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:30.431]  Well, actually, no.
[01:06:30.431 --> 01:06:32.692]  The 17 years came after the fact that I cried.
[01:06:32.692 --> 01:06:34.414]  I cried when I brought up my daughter.
[01:06:34.414 --> 01:06:37.176]  But the tears that I had were from my daughter and my daughter alone.
[01:06:37.176 --> 01:06:40.939]  Not anything that the judge had to say to the prosecution.
[01:06:40.939 --> 01:06:46.764]  After I spoke and I had, you know, I had gotten emotional about my daughter, I sat down and that's when the judge read the 17 years.
[01:06:46.764 --> 01:06:49.446]  Oh, so they even spun that, that you cried after the Senate.
[01:06:49.446 --> 01:06:51.448]  You cried for your daughter.
[01:06:51.448 --> 01:06:52.609]  Yeah, I cried for my daughter.
[01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:53.109]  That was it.
[01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:54.670]  There was no anybody in that courtroom.
[01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:55.511]  I got letters today.
[01:06:56.076 --> 01:06:59.918]  And it was emotional to hear you talk about your daughter, but it had nothing to do with the sentencing.
[01:06:59.918 --> 01:07:01.679]  I sat there and took that like a man.
[01:07:01.679 --> 01:07:07.043]  I looked at him and did whatever I had to do, you know, and I walked out of there with my head held high, and I'm going to continue to fight.
[01:07:07.043 --> 01:07:10.705]  It just shows, Joe, they lie about everything, don't they?
[01:07:10.705 --> 01:07:11.225]  Yeah, of course.
[01:07:11.225 --> 01:07:15.508]  I saw, we saw an article on our little prison tablet they gave us last night.
[01:07:15.508 --> 01:07:18.490]  It was on Yahoo saying that Proud Boys cry at trial.
[01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:20.831]  Not one of us cried about anything like that.
[01:07:20.831 --> 01:07:25.674]  It was only when we brought up the fact the guys of us who have kids, which is most of us except for one of us, I think,
[01:07:26.521 --> 01:07:35.844]  We brought up our children, or saw our children in the pews, we got teary-eyed to think about that, to know that our children aren't going to see us again for a long time.
[01:07:35.844 --> 01:07:40.686]  From here, you know, go to JoeFreeJoeBiggs.com, help out.
[01:07:40.686 --> 01:07:46.548]  That money goes either to my appeals, or it goes to my mother and daughter to help out.
[01:07:46.548 --> 01:07:48.569]  I don't get any of this personally in any kind of way.
[01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:51.171]  It's not going to help me.
[01:07:51.171 --> 01:07:52.211]  We know that.
[01:07:52.211 --> 01:07:54.311]  You don't need to put a proviso.
[01:07:54.311 --> 01:07:59.033]  I think your goal is too low because it's going to take... I know how these appeals work.
[01:07:59.033 --> 01:08:04.254]  It's going to cost a million bucks over the next few years for your appeal alone, and you're only asking for $75,000.
[01:08:04.254 --> 01:08:10.736]  Well, yeah, that was when we first had it.
[01:08:10.736 --> 01:08:15.517]  But yeah, we're going to re-up that and change some stuff and redo some of the wording on it and ask for more.
[01:08:16.494 --> 01:08:20.297]  That was just from, I've had this up for a little while.
[01:08:20.297 --> 01:08:21.478]  Well, you're a great guy, brother.
[01:08:21.478 --> 01:08:25.822]  I know they're about to hang up on you in a minute, but just say as much as you want before they disconnect you.
[01:08:25.822 --> 01:08:28.784]  Well, I will say this.
[01:08:28.784 --> 01:08:31.347]  The next place I'm going to, I put in for Coleman Lowe.
[01:08:31.347 --> 01:08:32.548]  That's in Florida.
[01:08:32.548 --> 01:08:35.210]  That's the same spot they sent Martha Stewart to.
[01:08:35.210 --> 01:08:37.332]  Obviously not the female wing.
[01:08:37.332 --> 01:08:39.193]  I'm sure that'd be a lot more fun.
[01:08:39.193 --> 01:08:42.036]  But they're sending me to the, possibly the Coleman Lowe.
[01:08:42.786 --> 01:08:44.947]  Uh, which is somewhere in Florida, north of Orlando.
[01:08:44.947 --> 01:08:49.369]  Well, just say you're a woman, you can be in the female wing.
[01:08:49.369 --> 01:08:52.411]  I think a few of us have tried that already, and they look at us like we're crazy.
[01:08:52.411 --> 01:08:58.033]  I think, uh, you know, I think unless you have Democrat on your voting card, they don't believe it.
[01:08:58.033 --> 01:08:59.634]  They'll just think that you're playing around.
[01:09:01.530 --> 01:09:03.892]  Well, it's good to hear you with so much humor.
[01:09:03.892 --> 01:09:06.734]  And we just keep asking listeners for help because they're coming after everybody, folks.
[01:09:06.734 --> 01:09:07.955]  We're here on the front line.
[01:09:07.955 --> 01:09:09.456]  We're in a war for everybody.
[01:09:09.456 --> 01:09:10.637]  And we're not complaining at listeners.
[01:09:10.637 --> 01:09:16.681]  But if you don't support FreeJoeBigs.com, then, you know, then you're supporting your own destruction.
[01:09:16.681 --> 01:09:19.923]  Yeah, I mean, first they came after me for shaking a fence.
[01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:20.884]  What next is it?
[01:09:21.365 --> 01:09:27.067]  You know, what's the next thing that's gonna happen that they're going to say is tantamount to terrorism?
[01:09:27.067 --> 01:09:30.208]  Um, you know, they blamed me for the very first breach.
[01:09:30.208 --> 01:09:34.729]  The judge looked me in the eye and said the very- You have one minute remaining.
[01:09:34.729 --> 01:09:35.449]  My fault.
[01:09:35.449 --> 01:09:38.130]  I was using a bullhorn further back.
[01:09:38.130 --> 01:09:41.031]  There was a guy in front of me close to the gate where Ray Epps was.
[01:09:41.031 --> 01:09:44.012]  Uh, we call him Black Megaphone Guy because we don't know his name.
[01:09:44.012 --> 01:09:46.873]  But he was sitting there telling everybody, the men come to the front.
[01:09:47.307 --> 01:09:49.088]  Get the women out of the front.
[01:09:49.088 --> 01:09:50.369]  We need to take the fence down.
[01:09:50.369 --> 01:09:51.290]  We need to push forward.
[01:09:51.290 --> 01:09:52.431]  We need to go after the cops.
[01:09:52.431 --> 01:09:53.131]  We need to get through.
[01:09:53.131 --> 01:09:54.012]  No, I've seen the videos.
[01:09:54.012 --> 01:09:57.134]  The left showed up dressed up like Trump supporters with the D.C.
[01:09:57.134 --> 01:10:00.056]  police and they did it all and it's incredible.
[01:10:00.056 --> 01:10:01.997]  All right, they're about to disconnect you, Joe.
[01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:02.938]  FreeJoeBiggs.com.
[01:10:02.938 --> 01:10:05.259]  You're going to call us back in 15 minutes?
[01:10:05.259 --> 01:10:05.920]  Yes, I am.
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:06.300]  I will be.
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:07.781]  All right, keep talking till the end.
[01:10:07.781 --> 01:10:09.562]  Just keep talking.
[01:10:09.562 --> 01:10:10.863]  Keep talking.
[01:10:10.863 --> 01:10:13.025]  Well, like I said, I appreciate everybody's help, man.
[01:10:13.025 --> 01:10:16.287]  Like, go there, help us out, and we would appreciate it.
[01:10:16.287 --> 01:10:16.507]  You know,
[01:10:17.943 --> 01:10:24.270]  It's interesting to see how the government has spun this entire situation.
[01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:25.471]  They have lied.
[01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:27.313]  They lied to the American people.
[01:10:27.313 --> 01:10:28.894]  The media helped it.
[01:10:28.894 --> 01:10:37.223]  The media sat there day in and day out and refused to report on the facts that we brought up during our trial and only... Thank you for using Global Telling.
[01:10:41.116 --> 01:10:42.377]  Ruthless lawyers.
[01:10:42.377 --> 01:10:43.677]  Ruthless Larry Fink.
[01:10:43.677 --> 01:10:44.317]  Blackrock.
[01:10:44.317 --> 01:10:47.018]  Just ordering destruction of everything.
[01:10:47.018 --> 01:10:47.839]  No borders.
[01:10:47.839 --> 01:10:49.019]  Human trafficking.
[01:10:49.019 --> 01:10:50.200]  Fentanyl.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.561]  Pedophilia with children.
[01:10:52.561 --> 01:10:53.901]  World government.
[01:10:53.901 --> 01:10:55.962]  World War III with Russia.
[01:10:55.962 --> 01:10:57.563]  Sellout to China.
[01:10:57.563 --> 01:10:58.723]  Political prisoners.
[01:10:58.723 --> 01:11:00.164]  Total surveillance.
[01:11:00.164 --> 01:11:02.085]  Censorship.
[01:11:02.085 --> 01:11:10.508]  And they've got all these yes men and women that are
[01:11:16.909 --> 01:11:19.210]  Just going along with her own destruction.
[01:11:19.210 --> 01:11:24.411]  You know, a lot of listeners have asked me, where is Stuart Rhodes?
[01:11:24.411 --> 01:11:26.312]  I've been trying to get him for a year.
[01:11:26.312 --> 01:11:28.793]  He's been in jail.
[01:11:28.793 --> 01:11:31.974]  Where's Joe Biggs?
[01:11:31.974 --> 01:11:35.355]  I have the same lawyer as Joe Biggs.
[01:11:35.355 --> 01:11:41.937]  And the calculus was, it'll make the judge mad if you're on air attacking him.
[01:11:41.937 --> 01:11:45.338]  And that's why.
[01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:48.470]  And then listeners are like, why aren't you talking about it?
[01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:51.432]  Well, I've been trying since he got sentenced.
[01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:54.354]  Get him on, took us two days, he's here.
[01:11:54.354 --> 01:11:56.735]  And you can say, well, just don't listen to the lawyers.
[01:11:56.735 --> 01:12:02.839]  I mean, it's his lawyer, Norm Pattis, and I get Norm's point.
[01:12:02.839 --> 01:12:09.223]  And so, all I can do is comply with what people want.
[01:12:09.223 --> 01:12:13.046]  Because it's not my life, it's Joe's life, it's his lawyer, it's what they decided to do.
[01:12:14.079 --> 01:12:16.399]  So we'll have Joe on all the time when he's able to call in now.
[01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:21.701]  I've been trying to get, you know, they're like, well, just, we want to piss people off and maybe that's the wrong strategy.
[01:12:21.701 --> 01:12:22.981]  I'm the type of guy that's going to talk crap.
[01:12:22.981 --> 01:12:25.101]  You saw me to these judges in my show trials.
[01:12:25.101 --> 01:12:26.302]  I say, you're a crook.
[01:12:26.302 --> 01:12:28.142]  You're a tyrant.
[01:12:28.142 --> 01:12:29.702]  Cause they're liars.
[01:12:29.702 --> 01:12:31.603]  The judge is like, he's got $400 million.
[01:12:31.603 --> 01:12:33.583]  I'm like, you're a liar.
[01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:34.663]  She's like, no jury.
[01:12:34.663 --> 01:12:37.464]  He's a liar.
[01:12:37.464 --> 01:12:38.164]  No, you're a liar.
[01:12:42.529 --> 01:12:45.511]  And so, that's where we're at.
[01:12:45.511 --> 01:12:47.853]  But now, boom.
[01:12:47.853 --> 01:12:49.895]  We're gonna get Norm on, too, about this.
[01:12:49.895 --> 01:12:54.098]  His lawyer, who's also been my lawyer, who's a famous criminal lawyer and a good guy.
[01:12:54.098 --> 01:12:57.741]  People say, oh, your lawyer did a terrible job in the Sandy Hook trial.
[01:12:57.741 --> 01:12:59.342]  They didn't let us talk.
[01:12:59.342 --> 01:13:03.665]  They gave our lawyers a list of like five things you could talk about for a show trial.
[01:13:03.665 --> 01:13:05.326]  I was already found guilty.
[01:13:05.326 --> 01:13:08.069]  They just found Giuliani guilty.
[01:13:08.069 --> 01:13:08.789]  A judge did.
[01:13:08.789 --> 01:13:10.871]  People are like, well, judges don't find you guilty.
[01:13:11.923 --> 01:13:13.725]  Folks, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:13:13.725 --> 01:13:18.990]  Have you figured that out yet?
[01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:22.433]  So, during the five-month trial, I'm like, hey, I really want him on.
[01:13:22.433 --> 01:13:23.133]  I want Joe on.
[01:13:23.133 --> 01:13:23.714]  I want you on.
[01:13:23.714 --> 01:13:24.755]  I want to support him.
[01:13:24.755 --> 01:13:28.959]  And they're like, listen, we think there's some humanity in this judge.
[01:13:28.959 --> 01:13:32.142]  And he's totally innocent, so we don't want to antagonize him.
[01:13:32.142 --> 01:13:35.625]  So we want to just try to, you know, see if they've got, and they don't have humanity.
[01:13:37.461 --> 01:13:39.742]  So, now I can talk about it.
[01:13:39.742 --> 01:13:41.802]  And you're like, well you should have talked about it.
[01:13:41.802 --> 01:13:45.263]  All I can do is honor people that are in jail and do what they want.
[01:13:45.263 --> 01:13:47.904]  I'm not going to sit there and make your decisions for them.
[01:13:47.904 --> 01:13:49.884]  And plus, what does it do saying the judge is a crook?
[01:13:49.884 --> 01:13:50.565]  They love it!
[01:13:50.565 --> 01:13:51.725]  They'll be promoted!
[01:13:51.725 --> 01:13:54.806]  They'll be out playing, the judge is probably playing golf today.
[01:13:54.806 --> 01:13:56.166]  Feels great!
[01:13:56.166 --> 01:13:58.107]  Has no sense of injustice.
[01:13:58.107 --> 01:14:00.987]  Rebs can run around and say, attack the Capitol, go in the Capitol.
[01:14:00.987 --> 01:14:02.888]  I orchestrated it, he said in his text messages.
[01:14:05.387 --> 01:14:06.989]  He's ramming signs into police.
[01:14:06.989 --> 01:14:11.132]  Joe Biggs is like shaking a fence.
[01:14:11.132 --> 01:14:12.774]  17 years, bitch.
[01:14:12.774 --> 01:14:15.256]  After three years in jail.
[01:14:15.256 --> 01:14:17.558]  Year and a half in solitary confinement.
[01:14:17.558 --> 01:14:23.984]  I mean, it's just like... And you're around these people and you get... But I'll tell you the unifying thing about them.
[01:14:23.984 --> 01:14:29.129]  Leftists and their minions are dishonorable, cowardly nobodies.
[01:14:29.129 --> 01:14:30.991]  And the world's waking up to them.
[01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:35.651]  The thing is, they're such crap that I don't even wish harm on them.
[01:14:35.651 --> 01:14:38.413]  I just want them to get out of my life, leave me alone, go away.
[01:14:38.413 --> 01:14:41.674]  Well, they're not gonna go away.
[01:14:41.674 --> 01:14:43.915]  And they're not gonna leave everybody alone.
[01:14:43.915 --> 01:14:49.337]  But listeners should use their heads, because it's not about me, it's not about Joe Biggs, it's about understanding things.
[01:14:49.337 --> 01:14:56.940]  It probably was smart to not have Joe Biggs on my show a bunch while he was facing this kangaroo trial.
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:59.021]  Because I get, you know, I think Norm's right.
[01:14:59.021 --> 01:15:00.502]  I think if Joe had talked crap,
[01:15:01.926 --> 01:15:04.767]  And they'd all been on the show, talking smack.
[01:15:04.767 --> 01:15:08.689]  That judge, you hit him on what the feds asked for.
[01:15:08.689 --> 01:15:15.213]  45 years in prison.
[01:15:15.213 --> 01:15:16.413]  Because the left likes it.
[01:15:16.413 --> 01:15:19.955]  They're like, oh, you don't like us putting you in jail?
[01:15:19.955 --> 01:15:21.296]  Cockroaches all over you?
[01:15:21.296 --> 01:15:22.076]  Well, guess what?
[01:15:22.076 --> 01:15:22.576]  You get 45, bitch.
[01:15:28.473 --> 01:15:30.514]  But I just love the other Patriots that are out there.
[01:15:30.514 --> 01:15:32.235]  They're like armchair quarterback.
[01:15:32.235 --> 01:15:37.338]  Why isn't Alex Jones, and it's on so many subjects, why isn't Alex Jones having them on?
[01:15:37.338 --> 01:15:42.261]  Why he doesn't care about those people.
[01:15:42.261 --> 01:15:47.064]  One former talk show host that worked here who just kept saying I was censoring when I wasn't.
[01:15:47.064 --> 01:15:49.325]  I was really upset that he was lying and saying I was censoring.
[01:15:49.325 --> 01:15:51.126]  I never even, barely even watched the show.
[01:15:51.126 --> 01:15:52.687]  I'm like, why are you saying that?
[01:15:52.687 --> 01:15:54.308]  Oh, he doesn't care about his crew.
[01:15:54.308 --> 01:15:55.288]  He's sent there.
[01:15:55.288 --> 01:15:56.629]  I didn't send Joe Biggs there.
[01:15:56.629 --> 01:15:57.870]  Joe Biggs hadn't worked here for years.
[01:15:58.911 --> 01:16:02.474]  I didn't send anybody into the damn Capitol.
[01:16:02.474 --> 01:16:05.556]  But Joe didn't do anything in the Capitol.
[01:16:05.556 --> 01:16:12.981]  So the idea that I'm sending people, and I'm doing this, and I'm all this crap, it's ridiculous.
[01:16:12.981 --> 01:16:14.462]  But I'm done talking about that.
[01:16:14.462 --> 01:16:19.886]  Because it's not about me, it's not about any of this, it's about the big picture.
[01:16:19.886 --> 01:16:25.030]  People sit back in their armchairs, and they think they know how stuff works, and they don't.
[01:16:26.479 --> 01:16:30.603]  Now Joe's scheduled to call in in about 7-8 minutes.
[01:16:30.603 --> 01:16:31.223]  So let's do this.
[01:16:31.223 --> 01:16:34.146]  Let's air Greg Reese's new report.
[01:16:34.146 --> 01:16:37.108]  And some other little important promo pieces.
[01:16:37.108 --> 01:16:40.671]  And then Joe should be able to get back in in about 6-7-8 minutes.
[01:16:40.671 --> 01:16:41.412]  We'll go to him.
[01:16:41.412 --> 01:16:44.715]  I guess technically 8 minutes from now I'll be able to call him.
[01:16:44.715 --> 01:16:50.700]  And then I'm gonna, I promise to do a deep dive on the ADL.
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:51.660]  And I promise to
[01:16:53.052 --> 01:16:57.134]  Hit some of this other news, and so I'm going to do that, and I'm going to do it more tomorrow night, too.
[01:16:57.134 --> 01:16:58.475]  4 to 6 p.m.
[01:16:58.475 --> 01:17:04.098]  MTG is going to be in studio and a lot more, so look for that.
[01:17:04.098 --> 01:17:20.768]  But I appreciate the crew coming in on Saturday, and I appreciate General Flynn being here, and I appreciate everybody else that's supporting the show and spreading the word, because we're in the situation we're in, and the globalists aren't going to go away without major opposition.
[01:17:20.768 --> 01:17:21.789]  The bad news is,
[01:17:22.861 --> 01:17:36.148]  They're not going to stop because they have this weird inferiority complex that they've got to attack good people and dominate us and rape us physically, biologically, chemically, medically, spiritually.
[01:17:36.148 --> 01:17:40.110]  But that's also the good news is that they'll get it in the end.
[01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:42.131]  But we don't do it because of vengeance against them.
[01:17:42.131 --> 01:17:42.752]  They're garbage.
[01:17:42.752 --> 01:17:43.812]  Who cares about them?
[01:17:43.812 --> 01:17:45.033]  We do it for the children.
[01:17:46.237 --> 01:17:49.219]  It's been said by many a leader throughout history, no one knows who first said it.
[01:17:49.219 --> 01:17:52.542]  It's just a cliched maxim because it's so true.
[01:17:52.542 --> 01:17:56.705]  We don't fight for the enemy in front of us that we hate.
[01:17:56.705 --> 01:17:58.246]  We fight for those behind us we love.
[01:17:58.246 --> 01:18:06.031]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:06.031 --> 01:18:13.397]  The recent fires in California, Australia, and now Hawaii are unlike anything we've ever seen before.
[01:18:14.755 --> 01:18:21.123]  They are being called forest fires and wildfires, but they are clearly something very different.
[01:18:21.123 --> 01:18:31.336]  These fires are burning homes into a white powdery ash footprint, while often leaving the surrounding green trees and shrubs practically untouched.
[01:18:32.546 --> 01:18:43.676]  In extreme cases, forest fires can reach temperatures up to 1500 degrees Fahrenheit, and the melting point of aluminum is 1220 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:18:43.676 --> 01:18:48.400]  So it is possible for an extreme forest fire to melt aluminum.
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:54.466]  But there are cars with puddles of melted aluminum that were clearly not in the wildfire area.
[01:18:55.652 --> 01:19:01.718]  And melted glass, which has a melting point around 2500 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:19:01.718 --> 01:19:04.361]  These are unexplained anomalies.
[01:19:04.361 --> 01:19:12.570]  In the California fires of 2018, cars were randomly bursting into flames on the freeway with no surrounding fires.
[01:19:14.195 --> 01:19:19.939]  We've seen these same anomalies in New York City on September 11th, 2001.
[01:19:19.939 --> 01:19:24.503]  Cars completely burned out with no explanation.
[01:19:24.503 --> 01:19:32.829]  In Maui, these unnatural fires spared the homes of the rich while burning the native homes of the working class.
[01:19:32.829 --> 01:19:38.954]  With precision, these fires destroyed the most envied, high-valued areas of Maui.
[01:19:40.071 --> 01:19:47.635]  For decades, directed energy weapons have been classified, but they have been on the public record for several years now.
[01:19:47.635 --> 01:19:54.739]  Directed energy weapons, known as DEWS, have the ability to burn homes with this sort of precision.
[01:19:54.739 --> 01:19:59.562]  But in order to be this precise, the area would have to be mapped out.
[01:19:59.562 --> 01:20:09.248]  In January of this year, green lasers were seen over Hawaii, which could best be described as a geospatial array for mapping terrain.
[01:20:10.936 --> 01:20:20.140]  We have seen that among the ashy ruins, there are blue-colored objects that have somehow survived the devastation.
[01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:22.341]  Blue cars.
[01:20:22.341 --> 01:20:24.802]  Blue umbrellas.
[01:20:24.802 --> 01:20:26.803]  A blue boat.
[01:20:26.803 --> 01:20:28.824]  Blue planters.
[01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:39.749]  Videos online are going viral that show how lasers can easily burn through certain colored objects, but objects that are colored blue remain unharmed.
[01:20:42.705 --> 01:20:49.088]  Directed energy weapons include lasers, millimeter wave, and microwave.
[01:20:49.088 --> 01:20:51.889]  They are all based on light frequencies.
[01:20:51.889 --> 01:20:56.551]  And different wavelengths of light affect colors differently.
[01:20:56.551 --> 01:21:04.034]  For example, in laser tattoo removal, different wavelengths are used for removing different colors.
[01:21:04.034 --> 01:21:07.736]  And this is because color is a quality of light.
[01:21:07.736 --> 01:21:09.677]  Each color has its own frequency.
[01:21:11.129 --> 01:21:18.037]  Interestingly enough, the frequency of the color blue is 6.66.
[01:21:18.037 --> 01:21:20.681]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:21:34.628 --> 01:21:36.209]  It's just a mask.
[01:21:36.209 --> 01:21:38.029]  It's just six feet.
[01:21:38.029 --> 01:21:40.590]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:43.011]  It's just non-essential workers.
[01:21:43.011 --> 01:21:45.572]  It's just until we work it out.
[01:21:45.572 --> 01:21:47.092]  It's just a bar.
[01:21:47.092 --> 01:21:48.273]  It's just a restaurant.
[01:21:49.252 --> 01:21:51.133]  It's just nursing homes.
[01:21:51.133 --> 01:21:53.015]  It's just schools.
[01:21:53.015 --> 01:21:56.317]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[01:21:56.317 --> 01:21:58.898]  It's just until the cases go down.
[01:21:58.898 --> 01:22:01.140]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:03.962]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[01:22:03.962 --> 01:22:06.423]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[01:22:06.423 --> 01:22:10.986]  It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events.
[01:22:10.986 --> 01:22:12.668]  It's just churches and mosques.
[01:22:13.448 --> 01:22:15.130]  It's just singing.
[01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:17.833]  It's just travel.
[01:22:17.833 --> 01:22:20.296]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[01:22:20.296 --> 01:22:22.258]  It's just for the greater good.
[01:22:22.258 --> 01:22:26.162]  It's just fact-checking, not censorship.
[01:22:26.162 --> 01:22:28.165]  It's just mandatory.
[01:22:28.165 --> 01:22:30.007]  It isn't just at all.
[01:22:30.007 --> 01:22:33.310]  Visit DefendJones.com to help fight back today.
[01:22:34.574 --> 01:22:35.975]  Bodies is back!

[01:23:33.256 --> 01:23:47.645]  So we came out here an hour ago and not one leftist would defend the mask from the shots with a coherent argument.
[01:23:47.645 --> 01:23:52.248]  None of them could change my mind about not wanting the COVID purity protocols to come back.
[01:23:53.989 --> 01:23:59.854]  And me, your non-binary, quadruple-backs champion!
[01:23:59.854 --> 01:24:06.080]  Tell me why we need new band-aids and new lock-downs at five minutes!
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:13.266]  I didn't take a shot, and I'm thankful for you that I didn't do that, because you awakened me to a lot of things.
[01:24:13.266 --> 01:24:13.887]  How are you doing?
[01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:19.570]  Tell us real quick, would you like to wear a mask again or try to bring the mandates back?
[01:24:19.570 --> 01:24:20.870]  I do not want to wear a mask.
[01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:21.170]  So you're not?
[01:24:21.170 --> 01:24:22.151]  Well, come tell us!
[01:24:22.151 --> 01:24:22.491]  No, no, no.
[01:24:22.491 --> 01:24:22.811]  You won't?
[01:24:22.811 --> 01:24:23.211]  Well, go ahead.
[01:24:23.211 --> 01:24:23.811]  You better speak up.
[01:24:23.811 --> 01:24:24.952]  They're coming to do it.
[01:24:24.952 --> 01:24:25.812]  So I'd say what?
[01:24:25.812 --> 01:24:27.092]  Five to one or against it?
[01:24:27.092 --> 01:24:28.072]  More shots!
[01:24:28.072 --> 01:24:28.973]  More shots!
[01:24:28.973 --> 01:24:29.773]  You want more shots?
[01:24:29.773 --> 01:24:31.033]  You need a hug!
[01:24:31.033 --> 01:24:32.074]  You need more shots!
[01:24:32.074 --> 01:24:32.414]  I do!
[01:24:32.414 --> 01:24:33.034]  Come give me a hug!
[01:24:33.294 --> 01:24:34.315]  Please don't hurt the baby.
[01:24:34.315 --> 01:24:35.675]  Please don't give him the poison shots.
[01:24:35.675 --> 01:24:49.044]  Alex Jones turned out to be right and Bill Gates and Fauci and Klaus Schwab, they turned out to be wrong because they were lying on purpose and they need to go to prison for what they've done!
[01:24:49.044 --> 01:24:50.825]  But the leftists, they don't like us.
[01:24:50.825 --> 01:24:51.765]  They want us to shut up.
[01:24:51.765 --> 01:24:53.106]  They want to shut you up.
[01:24:53.106 --> 01:24:54.627]  But we're not going to shut up because we're
[01:24:56.260 --> 01:25:05.385]  We have only begun to fight in the information war and we will NEVER SURRENDER!
[01:25:05.385 --> 01:25:08.387]  NEVER SURRENDER!
[01:25:08.387 --> 01:25:11.309]  Yes, you there in the black Ford truck.
[01:25:11.309 --> 01:25:12.690]  Are you planning to take more shots?
[01:25:19.611 --> 01:25:23.414]  Here's Harari saying, we're gonna make aliens on Earth.
[01:25:23.414 --> 01:25:28.297]  We're gonna merge the machines and be a new life form, a new ruling alien class on Earth.
[01:25:28.297 --> 01:25:30.458]  See, they're building the aliens.
[01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:33.340]  The biomedical AI merger with our flesh.
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:34.941]  The raping of humanity.
[01:25:34.941 --> 01:25:37.203]  It's the same story from Roswell in the late 40s.
[01:25:37.203 --> 01:25:42.146]  With Colonel Corso, heavily promoted everywhere by the biggest publishers, by the biggest movie makers.
[01:25:42.146 --> 01:25:43.867]  That was system funded.
[01:25:43.867 --> 01:25:47.550]  Because they don't want you to understand the full spectrum of interdimensional contact.
[01:25:47.850 --> 01:25:53.954]  And the fact that it's always been here, and these things actually aren't alien, they're part of our existence and part of our story here.
[01:25:53.954 --> 01:25:57.175]  If anything's the aliens, it's us, put here on this planet by God.
[01:25:57.175 --> 01:25:59.297]  And there's these things that were already basically here.
[01:25:59.297 --> 01:26:03.179]  We've probably not been here as long as this thing's been here, if you really read the ancient text of the Bible.
[01:26:03.359 --> 01:26:06.800]  So they don't want you to know it's far more complex and they're not in control of it.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:13.103]  All they're doing is being demonically inspired by these creatures that will only give them Hellraiser visions.
[01:26:13.103 --> 01:26:17.864]  It will only give them how to have technology for evil because it doesn't like us.
[01:26:17.864 --> 01:26:19.105]  This is just a training camp.
[01:26:19.545 --> 01:26:22.187]  Where our father has put us here.
[01:26:22.187 --> 01:26:34.776]  We think we're only living on one life so that we're in this super scared position but having all these spiritual and ancestral intergalactic interdimensional memories and it's all a giant three-dimensional real scenario war game.
[01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:36.777]  And they don't want you to know that.
[01:26:36.777 --> 01:26:39.237]  And they don't want you to understand they signed on to the wrong team.
[01:26:39.237 --> 01:26:46.119]  They joined with the destructive force, the evil force, so they could have power during the third-dimensional simulation?
[01:26:46.119 --> 01:26:49.641]  It's a three-dimensional, genetic, universal simulation.
[01:26:49.641 --> 01:26:50.921]  It's a real simulation.
[01:26:50.921 --> 01:26:52.381]  It's just that it's forever war.
[01:26:52.381 --> 01:26:53.662]  You don't die when you die.
[01:26:54.082 --> 01:26:57.065]  You're an electrochemical multi-dimensional creature.
[01:26:57.065 --> 01:26:59.988]  This is only one lowest manifestation of you.
[01:26:59.988 --> 01:27:01.450]  You have glorified heavenly bodies.
[01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:03.832]  There's this first heaven, the second heaven, the third heaven.
[01:27:03.832 --> 01:27:06.736]  It's all right there for you to understand.
[01:27:06.736 --> 01:27:07.897]  And again, what is the heaven?
[01:27:07.897 --> 01:27:08.798]  A dimension.
[01:27:08.798 --> 01:27:14.344]  They are programming that aliens are these little stupid gray things and they want to kidnap us at night and take stuff from us.
[01:27:14.344 --> 01:27:14.624]  And they're
[01:27:14.684 --> 01:27:16.684]  There is some evidence for some lower-level creatures.
[01:27:16.684 --> 01:27:18.845]  They're like a biological android.
[01:27:18.845 --> 01:27:24.946]  This whole big UFO thing is a distraction that, oh, the aliens are harassing our ships.
[01:27:24.946 --> 01:27:27.247]  The aliens are harassing our troops.
[01:27:27.247 --> 01:27:37.489]  No, that's the globalists with their advanced technology playing games, so they can brand contact with the angels and God as the devil, when really, we're here with the devil.
[01:27:37.489 --> 01:27:38.570]  We're not locked in here with the devil.
[01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:39.470]  The devil's locked in here with us.
[01:27:39.850 --> 01:27:47.837]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like, at least in government.
[01:27:47.837 --> 01:27:53.622]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[01:27:53.622 --> 01:27:55.964]  The left have wised up to this.
[01:27:55.964 --> 01:28:02.729]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it, the social media giants.
[01:28:02.729 --> 01:28:03.130]  And they are.
[01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:09.216]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[01:28:09.216 --> 01:28:14.021]  So far the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[01:28:14.021 --> 01:28:21.729]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[01:28:21.869 --> 01:28:27.851]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[01:28:27.851 --> 01:28:34.893]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[01:28:34.893 --> 01:28:44.676]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press working with big tech.
[01:28:45.276 --> 01:28:46.797]  People know what's true.
[01:28:46.797 --> 01:28:48.118]  They can smell it.
[01:28:48.118 --> 01:28:53.562]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:28:53.562 --> 01:28:55.924]  In a free country, everyone can be heard.
[01:28:55.924 --> 01:29:02.428]  In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be heard.
[01:29:02.428 --> 01:29:04.550]  It's a Saturday emergency broadcast.
[01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:05.831]  General Flynn, myself,
[01:29:06.934 --> 01:29:10.075]  Lay out the Globalist's next move and how to stop them.
[01:29:10.075 --> 01:29:10.656]  Joe Biggs.
[01:29:10.656 --> 01:29:15.898]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:29:15.898 --> 01:29:17.479]  Locked up in the D.C.
[01:29:17.479 --> 01:29:20.520]  Gulag.
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.841]  Can only get in 15 minutes at a time.
[01:29:22.841 --> 01:29:24.862]  You heard him about 15 minutes ago get cut off.
[01:29:24.862 --> 01:29:29.744]  We're waiting for his call again right now.
[01:29:29.744 --> 01:29:31.745]  The day we got greenlit to get him on the show.
[01:29:33.462 --> 01:29:37.306]  Because again, the political persecutors attack you when you defend yourself.
[01:29:37.306 --> 01:29:40.509]  So now that he's sentenced, he's ready to come on the show.
[01:29:40.509 --> 01:29:43.052]  We want to get Stuart Rhodes on.
[01:29:43.052 --> 01:29:45.134]  All of them are political prisoners.
[01:29:45.134 --> 01:29:49.198]  Remember a few months ago, oh, Rams is going to be indicted, they said in a lawsuit against Fox.
[01:29:49.198 --> 01:29:49.658]  Didn't happen.
[01:29:50.492 --> 01:29:53.353]  They just create that illusion to get us to stop talking about it.
[01:29:53.353 --> 01:30:01.256]  Hey, all I know is he said he orchestrated it in his text messages and said go into the Capitol and help ram signs into people and he says he'll sue you if you talk about it.
[01:30:01.256 --> 01:30:06.778]  And I'm sure they'll probably sue and have me defaulted and the judge says I'm guilty and $85 billion to him.
[01:30:06.778 --> 01:30:10.159]  So what?
[01:30:10.159 --> 01:30:10.679]  He did it.
[01:30:10.679 --> 01:30:11.900]  He said it.
[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:12.500]  It's going on.
[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:15.401]  I'm not going to shut up about any of it.
[01:30:15.401 --> 01:30:18.102]  But I want to thank everybody that's gone to defendjones.com.
[01:30:19.187 --> 01:30:20.469]  Infowars is stabilized.
[01:30:20.469 --> 01:30:22.251]  The bankruptcy looks like it's going through.
[01:30:22.251 --> 01:30:23.993]  Everything I told the court was true.
[01:30:23.993 --> 01:30:25.334]  Everything that media said was a lie.
[01:30:25.334 --> 01:30:26.075]  You've seen all that.
[01:30:26.075 --> 01:30:30.480]  We don't have $10 million versus $400 million.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:36.386]  And I've got a year of legal bills built up that I've gotten a really good crop of new lawyers last year.
[01:30:36.386 --> 01:30:38.189]  They haven't been paid yet.
[01:30:39.326 --> 01:30:41.688]  And that's because the judge got lied to and told that I had all this money.
[01:30:41.688 --> 01:30:42.990]  So the judge said, well, he can pay his legal bills.
[01:30:42.990 --> 01:30:44.911]  And now the judge is like, wait, he didn't have any money.
[01:30:44.911 --> 01:30:46.953]  But I still have the old bill.
[01:30:46.953 --> 01:30:48.255]  That's about to all get fixed.
[01:30:48.255 --> 01:30:51.137]  The judge has signaled where he now realizes he was lied to.
[01:30:51.137 --> 01:30:53.640]  But for now, I need to pay that million dollars.
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:55.141]  Like, that's a lot of money.
[01:30:55.141 --> 01:30:57.483]  Not really in today's numbers, folks, with inflation.
[01:30:57.483 --> 01:31:00.006]  Trump has spent 67 million this year on lawyers.
[01:31:00.526 --> 01:31:04.790]  With hundreds of lawsuits and all the rest of it and all the criminal charges.
[01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:05.090]  Great.
[01:31:05.090 --> 01:31:06.111]  Trump needs support.
[01:31:06.111 --> 01:31:08.033]  Well, I don't need $67 million.
[01:31:08.033 --> 01:31:10.115]  I need a million dollars.
[01:31:10.115 --> 01:31:11.656]  Or we go off the air.
[01:31:11.656 --> 01:31:14.319]  Because if they shut me down, I can't be here.
[01:31:14.319 --> 01:31:17.462]  Infowarsstore.com funds free speech systems, great products you need.
[01:31:18.595 --> 01:31:22.936]  But DEFENDJONES.COM is where you can make straight donations.
[01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:24.496]  And I want to thank the listeners for their support.
[01:31:24.496 --> 01:31:28.037]  I'm going to be thanking more of you tomorrow on the Sunday Show.
[01:31:28.037 --> 01:31:29.217]  But you know who you are.
[01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:31.318]  I think we've raised $60-something thousand dollars.
[01:31:31.318 --> 01:31:34.038]  We can put DEFENDJONES.COM on the screen.
[01:31:34.038 --> 01:31:39.239]  And I know I come to you and ask for your support.
[01:31:39.239 --> 01:31:40.400]  And my eyes aren't that good.
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:41.520]  What's the number there?
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:41.860]  That's $65,000.
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:42.820]  Sounds like a lot, folks.
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:43.760]  No, that's just 6%.
[01:31:49.887 --> 01:31:53.829]  Of what we need, but we're going to get there, and I appreciate your support.
[01:31:53.829 --> 01:31:56.590]  And here I am saying support Joe Biggs, political prisoner.
[01:31:56.590 --> 01:32:00.232]  I mean, it takes money to fight these wars, or you can just roll over and give up.
[01:32:00.232 --> 01:32:02.993]  Joe Biggs got back through from the D.C.
[01:32:02.993 --> 01:32:04.054]  jail.
[01:32:04.054 --> 01:32:07.195]  You've got now 13 minutes before they hang up on you again.
[01:32:07.195 --> 01:32:11.077]  So, Joe, I'm just going to give you the floor, because I was interrupting earlier, because it's good to hear your voice.
[01:32:11.077 --> 01:32:17.040]  I have a lot of questions, but you've got the floor to talk about the trial, what's coming next, the state of the country, just what you're witnessing.
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:18.301]  Everybody wants to hear from Joe Biggs.
[01:32:18.761 --> 01:32:25.847]  Yeah, the trial was a very interesting process to go through.
[01:32:25.847 --> 01:32:31.472]  You know, you're told that you're going to pick a jury of your peers.
[01:32:31.472 --> 01:32:32.633]  These aren't our peers.
[01:32:32.633 --> 01:32:33.473]  The people of D.C.
[01:32:33.473 --> 01:32:35.635]  hate everything that we stand for.
[01:32:35.635 --> 01:32:39.378]  Anyone who's conservative, anyone who's right-leaning in any kind of way, you're an outcast.
[01:32:39.378 --> 01:32:39.959]  You're a hated.
[01:32:39.959 --> 01:32:41.941]  They think that you are the scum of the earth.
[01:32:41.941 --> 01:32:43.982]  So to say that you're going to get a fair trial in D.C.
[01:32:43.982 --> 01:32:45.964]  is the most hilarious thing in the world.
[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:48.760]  These people convicted us.
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:50.861]  They won.
[01:32:50.861 --> 01:32:51.601]  They said so.
[01:32:51.601 --> 01:32:53.521]  They said that we were guilty from the get-go.
[01:32:53.521 --> 01:32:55.962]  They didn't care what was shown to them.
[01:32:55.962 --> 01:33:02.843]  They didn't care that we showed how many times the FBI lied, how many times on video that we got the FBI.
[01:33:02.843 --> 01:33:13.786]  We could see them coercing and changing the words of their own witnesses to fit the narrative that they wanted and still the jury goes, I don't care.
[01:33:13.786 --> 01:33:15.446]  Still the judge goes, I don't care.
[01:33:16.165 --> 01:33:24.871]  Um, it was the most disheartening thing to go through because you watch, you know, and we're sitting there, we're bringing forth the truth.
[01:33:24.871 --> 01:33:27.733]  But the truth isn't, you know, the courtroom's not a place for the truth, obviously.
[01:33:27.733 --> 01:33:36.179]  I mean, this is a place for, you know, whatever they're allowed to put through, and the judge allowed the government to get away with everything and push whatever they wanted to through.
[01:33:36.179 --> 01:33:40.242]  And it was, uh, it hurt to watch that.
[01:33:40.242 --> 01:33:44.965]  You know, you go in there with your head held high, you go in there,
[01:33:45.768 --> 01:33:48.510]  Thinking that, you know what, we're just going to keep fighting.
[01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:50.131]  You know, we're going to keep going.
[01:33:50.131 --> 01:33:52.472]  And this machine is so big, they just don't care.
[01:33:52.472 --> 01:33:54.333]  That's why people need to wake up.
[01:33:54.333 --> 01:33:55.694]  People need to get off their butts.
[01:33:55.694 --> 01:34:01.437]  People need to understand that there's a war going on in the sense that, you know, they're coming after our rights.
[01:34:01.437 --> 01:34:05.100]  They are doing everything they can to throw us in jail.
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:06.601]  Oh, oh, and war.
[01:34:06.601 --> 01:34:07.941]  Let's talk about the word war.
[01:34:07.941 --> 01:34:11.544]  Apparently, I say the word war too much.
[01:34:11.544 --> 01:34:12.884]  And I know you guys say that.
[01:34:12.884 --> 01:34:13.825]  It's a war for your mind.
[01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:16.151]  You gotta watch out, Alex.
[01:34:16.151 --> 01:34:20.674]  The judge brought up the fact that I said war so many times and they even brought it up to prosecution.
[01:34:20.674 --> 01:34:24.257]  The amount of times I've said war before, that's a no-no.
[01:34:24.257 --> 01:34:30.122]  You can't say that word anymore because then that means you're waging war against the government and you're a terrorist.
[01:34:30.122 --> 01:34:35.407]  You know, the things that came out in this trial just... I don't understand it.
[01:34:35.407 --> 01:34:40.030]  You know, you go in there with everything on your side.
[01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:41.051]  All that's right.
[01:34:41.051 --> 01:34:41.712]  All that's good.
[01:34:42.504 --> 01:34:44.406]  And they still don't care.
[01:34:44.406 --> 01:34:46.568]  The judge still sits there.
[01:34:46.568 --> 01:34:56.156]  In the same video that they used, they showed, I remember when I first got locked up, they showed the judge, the government showed the judge of me shaking this fence or whatever.
[01:34:56.156 --> 01:35:04.624]  And the judge, his first response was, I didn't see anything in there that shows Joe breaking the fence, so I'm not going to deny him bail.
[01:35:04.624 --> 01:35:05.705]  And then he comes back like,
[01:35:07.028 --> 01:35:09.449]  Two days later, and goes, that's terrorism!
[01:35:09.449 --> 01:35:11.710]  Lock him up and throws him in jail.
[01:35:11.710 --> 01:35:12.771]  It was so weird.
[01:35:12.771 --> 01:35:17.072]  His initial response... Because he clearly got his orders later.
[01:35:17.072 --> 01:35:18.193]  Yeah.
[01:35:18.193 --> 01:35:20.334]  You know, I mean, it was so weird.
[01:35:20.334 --> 01:35:21.314]  It was night and day.
[01:35:21.314 --> 01:35:24.075]  Because he sits there and he looks at it and he's telling the government, like, I don't see this.
[01:35:24.075 --> 01:35:25.256]  This doesn't make sense to me.
[01:35:25.256 --> 01:35:28.877]  That's the same video that they played over and over in trial.
[01:35:28.877 --> 01:35:30.298]  The same video that they used.
[01:35:30.822 --> 01:35:31.122]  Yeah, I saw
[01:35:52.358 --> 01:36:00.102]  So much crazy stuff happened in that day, and we're the ones that have come out to be the worst of the worst, they said.
[01:36:00.102 --> 01:36:05.264]  They said that our actions were the ones that... our actions were responsible for the deaths that day.
[01:36:05.264 --> 01:36:06.084]  Well, they said you led it.
[01:36:06.084 --> 01:36:07.845]  They said you did it.
[01:36:07.845 --> 01:36:13.788]  Yeah, they said that my military experience is what gave me the ability to lead an army against the government.
[01:36:13.788 --> 01:36:16.569]  But is there video of you saying, we go into the Capitol?
[01:36:16.569 --> 01:36:20.110]  Or video of you saying... or a text message of you saying, you orchestrated it?
[01:36:20.110 --> 01:36:21.011]  No, that's Ray Epps.
[01:36:22.190 --> 01:36:23.852]  Yeah, there's none of that whatsoever.
[01:36:23.852 --> 01:36:28.636]  They have a video of me going, oh my god, I can't believe everybody just stormed the Capitol.
[01:36:28.636 --> 01:36:35.281]  There's even a video of me where I'm walking and I'm filming it and I'm going, oh my god, we've just walked over the barriers.
[01:36:35.281 --> 01:36:39.345]  We've just walked over the barriers, not we've just taken them down or we've just busted them.
[01:36:39.345 --> 01:36:41.527]  We've just walked over them because someone else had knocked them down.
[01:36:41.877 --> 01:36:43.358]  We've just walked over the barriers.
[01:36:43.358 --> 01:36:44.558]  Oh my God, I can't believe this.
[01:36:44.558 --> 01:36:45.999]  People are storming the Capitol.
[01:36:45.999 --> 01:36:50.601]  And there's a lady with a little, like, chihuahua going past me faster than I'm going.
[01:36:50.601 --> 01:36:52.061]  And a guy in a wheelchair passed me.
[01:36:52.061 --> 01:36:53.882]  But they said that I ran up and led the charge.
[01:36:53.882 --> 01:36:58.664]  And I have people literally passing me as I'm walking and going, Oh my God, I can't believe this is happening.
[01:36:58.664 --> 01:37:01.706]  You know, I'm saying, Oh my God, I can't believe this is happening.
[01:37:01.706 --> 01:37:02.826]  And that's my initial response.
[01:37:02.826 --> 01:37:03.687]  What does that tell you?
[01:37:03.687 --> 01:37:04.787]  There's not a plan.
[01:37:04.787 --> 01:37:07.188]  I'm literally shocked by what's happening.
[01:37:07.188 --> 01:37:09.229]  You know, and they go, Well, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:10.229]  He knew this was happening.
[01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:11.450]  There was a meeting of the mind.
[01:37:11.917 --> 01:37:29.090]  It happened somehow between them, and they all agreed that this was going to happen, even though there's no proof that there was ever on paper that it was said, that there was no recording, and not one person's ever come forward, and not one FBI employee's ever come forward and said that there was a plan, that there was proof of a plan or anything like that.
[01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:39.819]  No, no, no, we just somehow had this meeting of the minds that never happened, but that's what caused this conspiracy, and that's why we're now seditious terrorists somehow.
[01:37:39.819 --> 01:37:41.120]  You know, if that can happen,
[01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:42.816]  What else can happen in court?
[01:37:42.816 --> 01:37:43.980]  What else can they get away with?
[01:37:46.004 --> 01:37:49.445]  And again, for some reason we can't find the footage of you just touching the fence.
[01:37:49.445 --> 01:37:52.246]  We have Ray Epps there ramming it over the police.
[01:37:52.246 --> 01:37:54.206]  What's the name of that video, Joe, so we can find it?
[01:37:54.206 --> 01:37:54.987]  We'll edit and post.
[01:37:54.987 --> 01:37:57.507]  We're live right now, but that's something we really want to air.
[01:37:57.507 --> 01:38:01.388]  I know they hide all the exculpatory footage, but this is Ray Epps.
[01:38:01.388 --> 01:38:05.990]  There he is, ramming it over the police and saying he orchestrated it and saying, go into the Capitol, but that's okay.
[01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:13.492]  Well, the very first, the very first, the very first, the very, very first January 6th committee hearing was on Donald Trump and me.
[01:38:14.150 --> 01:38:20.211]  The very first one, if you remember, the very first one, they talked about Donald Trump for the first half, and then Joe Biggs.
[01:38:20.211 --> 01:38:34.274]  And the female cop that gets knocked over by Ryan Sample goes, Joe Biggs was in the crowd, and he had his bullhorn, and he looked at me and said, I don't like cops, and cops are trash, and everybody come and, you know, take out the cops or some crap like that.
[01:38:34.274 --> 01:38:37.895]  And I'm like, I'm sitting here watching this from jail going, are you serious?
[01:38:38.490 --> 01:38:38.810]  I don't know.
[01:38:57.557 --> 01:38:58.158]  That's not me.
[01:38:58.158 --> 01:38:58.938]  That's Ray Epps.
[01:38:58.938 --> 01:39:00.299]  It's incredible.
[01:39:00.299 --> 01:39:01.140]  It's incredible.
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:03.762]  So we're showing the footage where you're standing at the fence doing nothing.
[01:39:03.762 --> 01:39:06.885]  This is your terrace now because of this footage we're showing right now.
[01:39:06.885 --> 01:39:08.767]  You standing against a fence.
[01:39:08.767 --> 01:39:13.311]  So... How are the other guys doing?
[01:39:13.311 --> 01:39:15.653]  Do you see them or what's happening?
[01:39:15.653 --> 01:39:16.033]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:16.033 --> 01:39:18.535]  They're all sitting around, you know.
[01:39:18.535 --> 01:39:24.200]  Enrique's reading the paper in front of me right now, but he can't talk because his trial... I mean, he's been in things not until Tuesday.
[01:39:24.819 --> 01:39:28.740]  Um, but, uh, he would like to come on if you guys want to have Enrique Carrillo in next week.
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:30.800]  He said he'd be interested in coming on.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:36.261]  Um, you know... No, we want them all, because I've been waiting to get you on, but obviously we didn't want to stir the court up.
[01:39:36.261 --> 01:39:39.061]  So when can Enrique come on?
[01:39:39.061 --> 01:39:42.542]  Enrique, Enrique!
[01:39:42.542 --> 01:39:44.322]  When do you want to come on with Alex?
[01:39:44.322 --> 01:39:45.002]  Next week?
[01:39:45.002 --> 01:39:47.723]  Afterward?
[01:39:47.723 --> 01:39:50.463]  You want to come on with Alex next week?
[01:39:50.463 --> 01:39:51.223]  Okay.
[01:39:51.223 --> 01:39:53.024]  Like, Wednesday?
[01:39:53.024 --> 01:39:53.604]  Okay, Wednesday.
[01:39:53.604 --> 01:39:54.164]  He said he can do it.
[01:39:55.011 --> 01:39:57.452]  We're literally talking to American political prisoners.
[01:39:57.452 --> 01:40:00.514]  We got four minutes left before they cut you off.
[01:40:00.514 --> 01:40:02.936]  Anything else you want to add right now, Joe Biggs?
[01:40:02.936 --> 01:40:06.778]  Yeah, so, you know, it was amazing.
[01:40:06.778 --> 01:40:11.461]  I walk out of the courtroom, I'm sitting there, I'm going through my mind.
[01:40:11.461 --> 01:40:14.163]  After the sentencing, it's hard to take it in.
[01:40:14.163 --> 01:40:17.064]  17 years, that's a big number.
[01:40:17.064 --> 01:40:19.166]  And your life kind of flashes before your eyes.
[01:40:19.166 --> 01:40:20.166]  You start to wonder, like, wow.
[01:40:22.139 --> 01:40:22.679]  Is this it?
[01:40:22.679 --> 01:40:23.440]  Is this really it?
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:26.482]  But then you have to pull yourself back up, and you have to go, no, this isn't it.
[01:40:26.482 --> 01:40:27.783]  This is only the beginning.
[01:40:27.783 --> 01:40:39.751]  This is where God starts to do His miracles, because when you're left with nothing, and you're sitting there, and your hands are tied behind your back, and you're in jail, and you're in solitary confinement, that's when God really comes through and works miracles.
[01:40:39.751 --> 01:40:46.135]  And I believe we're going to see miracles happen, and I believe God's going to have something good come out of this, because there's just been so much bad going on.
[01:40:46.135 --> 01:40:49.297]  We're seeing this country in such a decline, and I guarantee you,
[01:40:50.146 --> 01:40:52.528]  Soon, we're going to start seeing some miracles happening.
[01:40:52.528 --> 01:40:54.389]  You know, it was heartfelt.
[01:40:54.389 --> 01:40:59.393]  You know, I walked through the door into the prison, and everybody ran up to me and gave me a hug.
[01:40:59.393 --> 01:41:02.235]  And everybody sat there in line, and they came up and shook my hand.
[01:41:02.235 --> 01:41:07.199]  And, you know, you could see the hurt in their eyes to hear that, you know, I just got 17 years, you know.
[01:41:07.199 --> 01:41:12.523]  And it was an emotional thing, you know, to have all these men that have been here with you that have gone through the same things.
[01:41:12.523 --> 01:41:15.986]  And you see them just go, oh my God, I can't believe this happened to you.
[01:41:16.601 --> 01:41:17.602]  Like, you didn't do anything.
[01:41:17.602 --> 01:41:19.783]  Everybody here knows that we didn't do anything.
[01:41:19.783 --> 01:41:22.605]  These other people will even say, look, I did this.
[01:41:22.605 --> 01:41:23.266]  I screwed up.
[01:41:23.266 --> 01:41:24.166]  I did something bad.
[01:41:24.166 --> 01:41:24.847]  I was violent.
[01:41:24.847 --> 01:41:25.727]  I did that.
[01:41:25.727 --> 01:41:35.034]  But everyone agrees we didn't do a single thing worthy of this, and yet we're the ones being hated on the most because we're the only ones who are willing to stand up to Antifa.
[01:41:35.034 --> 01:41:43.540]  We're the only ones who are willing to go out there and speak our minds and say what the government was doing wrong, and they came after us, and they want to shut us up, and they want to scare the American public.
[01:41:43.874 --> 01:41:44.295]  We're good to go.
[01:42:06.243 --> 01:42:10.086]  Well, it sounds like you're buoyed by the fact that people know that you're innocent and that this is all a lie.
[01:42:10.086 --> 01:42:13.389]  Yeah, I mean, it doesn't matter where we go, people come up to us and go, this is a Travis
[01:42:36.636 --> 01:42:37.617]  You shouldn't be here.
[01:42:37.617 --> 01:42:39.378]  I mean, I have hardcore criminals.
[01:42:39.378 --> 01:42:44.082]  On the bus ride back from the courthouse, back here to the jail, there's a guy sitting beside me.
[01:42:44.082 --> 01:42:49.686]  He just got picked up for selling 13 illegal firearms in D.C.
[01:42:49.686 --> 01:42:51.988]  That should be five years for each weapon.
[01:42:51.988 --> 01:42:53.149]  He got a two-year deal.
[01:42:53.149 --> 01:42:55.911]  He got a two-year plea deal.
[01:42:55.911 --> 01:42:56.732]  He's laughing at me.
[01:42:56.732 --> 01:42:57.613]  He goes, oh my God.
[01:42:57.613 --> 01:43:00.895]  Another guy goes, man, I just got like so and so many years for murder.
[01:43:00.895 --> 01:43:02.917]  He goes, you could have killed someone and gotten out quicker than me.
[01:43:03.447 --> 01:43:18.844]  You know, because they put you in a bus with a bunch of prisoners, they bring you back to the jail, and it's different people from different walks of life that are there for different crimes, you know, and everyone's like, oh my god, like, I can't believe that a guy who walked around who has no criminal record is now considered a terrorist.
[01:43:18.844 --> 01:43:24.129]  Oh, people are pointing out that rapists that beat women up and torture them get two years, and you get 17 years.
[01:43:26.263 --> 01:43:26.803]  Yeah.
[01:43:26.803 --> 01:43:40.733]  I mean, it's crazy when you see, like, hardened gangbangers, guys who've been, you know, their whole lives, you know, doing stuff like this, you know, going out, shooting at people, beating people up, beating them half to death, and they look at you and go, man, you don't deserve to be here.
[01:43:40.733 --> 01:43:41.554]  You're not like me.
[01:43:41.554 --> 01:43:43.475]  Like, I deserve to be in jail, they'll say.
[01:43:43.475 --> 01:43:44.956]  They go, but you don't.
[01:43:44.956 --> 01:43:46.578]  You should be at home right now with your daughter.
[01:43:46.578 --> 01:43:48.799]  You deserve to be out there on the streets.
[01:43:48.799 --> 01:43:49.880]  Not us, but you do.
[01:43:50.652 --> 01:44:03.124]  And I guarantee you, myself, Ethan, Nordin, Zachary Real, Dominic Pozzola, Enrique Tarrio will have similar stories from their experiences over the last three years at the jails they've been to.
[01:44:03.124 --> 01:44:05.045]  No one thinks that we should be here.
[01:44:05.045 --> 01:44:08.769]  No one believes that this is actually happening, but it is.
[01:44:08.769 --> 01:44:12.933]  And people need to understand that it's time to do something.
[01:44:12.933 --> 01:44:14.234]  Everything that's happening to Trump,
[01:44:15.228 --> 01:44:16.709]  It's happened to me already.
[01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:18.170]  Now it's happening to him.
[01:44:18.170 --> 01:44:19.211]  And then guess what?
[01:44:19.211 --> 01:44:20.211]  It's going to happen to you.
[01:44:20.211 --> 01:44:28.497]  Do you have hope that if Trump gets elected, despite all the challenges, he'll pardon you?
[01:44:28.497 --> 01:44:29.698]  Oh, I know he'll pardon us.
[01:44:29.698 --> 01:44:31.259]  I believe that with all my heart.
[01:44:31.259 --> 01:44:38.964]  You know, the thing is, is hopefully getting him, uh, you know, for him to be able to get into the position where he can at least be
[01:44:39.804 --> 01:44:41.606]  I think on the ballot to run, right?
[01:44:41.606 --> 01:44:44.829]  Because once- You have one minute remaining.
[01:44:44.829 --> 01:44:45.951]  Election interference, right?
[01:44:45.951 --> 01:44:50.315]  It's election interference if they start trying to go after him once he's on there.
[01:44:50.315 --> 01:44:58.023]  I have to understand the legalities of that, but I do believe that Donald J. Trump will pardon us, and he should.
[01:44:58.023 --> 01:45:00.105]  We didn't do anything, you know?
[01:45:00.105 --> 01:45:01.367]  We're his supporters.
[01:45:01.367 --> 01:45:02.448]  We went there like he asked.
[01:45:02.788 --> 01:45:07.970]  And things were wrong that day, and that's sad, and that's... Well, there's no doubt that they set us all up.
[01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:10.411]  We were all patsies that day, Joe.
[01:45:10.411 --> 01:45:13.932]  You gotta come back on any time you want on the broadcast.
[01:45:13.932 --> 01:45:15.152]  Anytime you can get on.
[01:45:15.152 --> 01:45:17.753]  11am to 3pm weekdays, Sundays.
[01:45:17.753 --> 01:45:18.653]  We can always tape.
[01:45:18.653 --> 01:45:19.654]  We love you.
[01:45:19.654 --> 01:45:23.235]  People should go to FreeJoeBiggs.com and donate to support your appeal.
[01:45:23.235 --> 01:45:24.275]  They want to grind us down.
[01:45:24.275 --> 01:45:25.376]  They want to break our will.
[01:45:25.376 --> 01:45:26.336]  Give me a 1776, brother.
[01:45:26.336 --> 01:45:26.536]  1776, brother.
[01:45:33.163 --> 01:45:35.465]  Alright Matt, I love you guys.
[01:45:35.465 --> 01:45:36.165]  Thanks for the look.
[01:45:36.165 --> 01:45:38.127]  Look, I said, they're not going to hold me down.
[01:45:38.127 --> 01:45:39.468]  I'm going to keep my head held high.
[01:45:39.468 --> 01:45:40.209]  I'm a warrior.
[01:45:40.209 --> 01:45:41.770]  I don't give up.
[01:45:41.770 --> 01:45:42.691]  This fight's not over.
[01:45:42.691 --> 01:45:44.612]  It's only just begun and I'm telling you right now.
[01:45:44.612 --> 01:45:49.276]  Thank you for using Global Telling.
[01:45:49.276 --> 01:45:54.100]  So, from a globalist gulag, Joe Beggs cut off.
[01:45:55.336 --> 01:45:56.917]  That's America.
[01:45:56.917 --> 01:46:02.719]  And if you don't think they're coming for your energy and your children and everything, I mean, it's full-on takeover.
[01:46:02.719 --> 01:46:05.200]  It's here.
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:10.022]  And again, I was not having these guys on because their lawyers didn't want to get in more trouble.
[01:46:10.022 --> 01:46:11.103]  They'd be like, where's Jones?
[01:46:11.103 --> 01:46:12.243]  I'm not supporting people.
[01:46:12.243 --> 01:46:14.705]  Well, you didn't know the inside baseball, now you do.
[01:46:14.705 --> 01:46:17.746]  So you can all feel morally superior and do the things you do.
[01:46:17.746 --> 01:46:19.026]  I'm not talking to our general audience.
[01:46:19.026 --> 01:46:21.688]  I just get so sick of it.
[01:46:21.688 --> 01:46:24.709]  But now that the guys are ready to come on, we'll have them all on.
[01:46:25.930 --> 01:46:27.511]  And I think they're probably right.
[01:46:27.511 --> 01:46:40.841]  I think, I think the judges would have given them, you know, 40 years, 45 years that the evil globalists, they're not feds, they're people that have hijacked our government, were asking for if they would have done interviews.
[01:46:40.841 --> 01:46:50.969]  So this is quite a moment to be alive, but we've got to roll our sleeves up and admit the predicament we're in.
[01:46:53.735 --> 01:46:56.577]  And do something about it, because it's not going to get any better bowing down.
[01:46:56.577 --> 01:47:02.541]  Putting on the knee pads, like Kamala Harris, isn't going to get us out of this.
[01:47:02.541 --> 01:47:04.982]  All right, here's what I'm going to do.
[01:47:04.982 --> 01:47:09.385]  I want to take the ADL to the woodshed, because it's been the top trending thing for a few days.
[01:47:09.385 --> 01:47:14.189]  People really get it now, and I've got a big stack here that ties into the UN, their whole operation.
[01:47:14.189 --> 01:47:19.452]  And I've got all this other news too, so I'm really loaded for bear.
[01:47:19.452 --> 01:47:20.613]  I'm going to come back tomorrow.
[01:47:22.598 --> 01:47:23.479]  4 to 6 p.m.
[01:47:23.479 --> 01:47:25.300]  MTG's in the studio in the second hour.
[01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:29.603]  But the first hour, I'm gonna do the ADL deep dive and some other things.
[01:47:29.603 --> 01:47:31.404]  But I got a few things I'm gonna hit right now.
[01:47:31.404 --> 01:47:34.366]  That's why I'm moving the ADL thing again to tomorrow.
[01:47:34.366 --> 01:47:44.854]  And I'm gonna hit it Monday and Tuesday because it is a... And I also now... I already knew the inside baseball of Elon Musk, whether he's good or not.
[01:47:44.854 --> 01:47:46.135]  And he wasn't good before.
[01:47:46.135 --> 01:47:49.077]  He wasn't totally bad.
[01:47:49.077 --> 01:47:50.698]  But he's been a globalist, darling.
[01:47:51.843 --> 01:47:52.924]  But he got power.
[01:47:52.924 --> 01:47:57.588]  He got to be the richest man in the world.
[01:47:57.588 --> 01:48:02.132]  And they took his son and are getting ready to chop his peepee off.
[01:48:02.132 --> 01:48:03.253]  That'll wake anybody up.
[01:48:03.253 --> 01:48:06.896]  His firstborn son.
[01:48:06.896 --> 01:48:10.158]  They want that firstborn, don't they?
[01:48:10.158 --> 01:48:17.825]  And another one of his children got killed, it looks like, by a vaccine with sudden infant death syndrome.
[01:48:19.508 --> 01:48:21.209]  And again, Musk lives here in Austin.
[01:48:21.209 --> 01:48:29.670]  I'm not going to get into any, you know, stuff here or what my sources are, but we have to be ready for Musk to come over to our side.
[01:48:29.670 --> 01:48:32.531]  And Vivek Ramaswamy, sure, he was a lot less before.
[01:48:32.531 --> 01:48:33.951]  He's joining us.
[01:48:33.951 --> 01:48:39.493]  The things he's saying are devastating them, and they're coming after him on every front.
[01:48:39.493 --> 01:48:44.414]  So I really want to caution everybody to not be Pharisees, because you know what happened in Christ's day.
[01:48:45.472 --> 01:48:50.956]  There were these, you know, members of the Sanhedrin and the rabbis that said they were holier than thou.
[01:48:50.956 --> 01:48:53.257]  Not all of them, but some of them.
[01:48:53.257 --> 01:48:58.401]  And they were always talking about how they were perfect, and they were good, and everybody else was bad.
[01:48:58.401 --> 01:49:03.264]  But Christ was talking to the tax collectors, the prostitutes, and people that actually wanted to be reformed.
[01:49:03.264 --> 01:49:10.809]  Like when he was dying on the cross, or about to die, and he got the thief, the murderer, and one of them believes in God, the other doesn't, so he says, you'll be with me today in paradise.
[01:49:13.533 --> 01:49:29.698]  So it doesn't mean I turn my back and don't watch Ramaswani or Musk, but I mean, look, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know, pun intended, that when you're... I mean, Musk came out today.
[01:49:29.698 --> 01:49:30.919]  In fact, I didn't see the article.
[01:49:30.919 --> 01:49:31.979]  I thought I sent it to you guys.
[01:49:31.979 --> 01:49:35.020]  It's an Infowars.com article.
[01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:38.722]  It's a Zero Hedge article.
[01:49:38.722 --> 01:49:40.002]  He responded and tweeted it.
[01:49:40.002 --> 01:49:41.723]  In fact, print it for me because I didn't see it.
[01:49:41.723 --> 01:49:42.863]  You may have given it to me, but I missed it.
[01:49:44.670 --> 01:49:52.555]  And he said, he said, yeah, the head of my marketing has been meeting with them, just like you meet in a mafia war with the other side that meetings with them.
[01:49:52.555 --> 01:49:55.257]  He said, the ADL has done everything they can.
[01:49:55.257 --> 01:49:56.177]  Here's the quote.
[01:49:56.177 --> 01:49:59.219]  ADL has tried very hard to strangle X Twitter.
[01:49:59.219 --> 01:50:03.382]  Elon Musk responds to hashtag ban the ADL.
[01:50:03.382 --> 01:50:11.447]  He says, just because I'm meeting with the extortionist, you know, Don Corleone met with the guys that shot him in the Godfather.
[01:50:11.447 --> 01:50:13.008]  It's all based on true story, different names.
[01:50:14.753 --> 01:50:15.873]  Doesn't mean Musk is with him.
[01:50:15.873 --> 01:50:21.275]  No, they're getting ready to chop his firstborn son's penis off.
[01:50:21.275 --> 01:50:23.716]  And if that doesn't wake your ass up, nothing will.
[01:50:23.716 --> 01:50:26.937]  Another one of his children, the evidence is overwhelming, was killed by a vaccine.
[01:50:26.937 --> 01:50:28.937]  His brother almost died from one.
[01:50:28.937 --> 01:50:30.318]  And he's like, you know what?
[01:50:30.318 --> 01:50:30.718]  I'm not.
[01:50:30.718 --> 01:50:36.500]  Yeah, there's his son.
[01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:37.360]  Captured by the enemy.
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:40.381]  I don't care how rich and powerful you are.
[01:50:40.381 --> 01:50:48.745]  If you're not pure evil, having your son getting ready to have his balls cut off will get your attention real quick.
[01:50:48.745 --> 01:50:51.746]  Prison's bad, but having your son's balls cut off is bad.
[01:50:51.746 --> 01:50:53.767]  It's worse.
[01:50:53.767 --> 01:51:00.050]  So that's where this is.
[01:51:00.050 --> 01:51:00.150]  And
[01:51:04.935 --> 01:51:22.821]  No, I actually know people that know Musk very closely and it's too big a subject to talk about at this point, but their words are is Musk is crazy because he's part of the people on our team completely.
[01:51:22.821 --> 01:51:25.262]  These are very prominent people.
[01:51:25.262 --> 01:51:32.365]  Musk is completely pissed and out of his mind at the New World War because they're getting ready to chop his son's balls off.
[01:51:33.945 --> 01:51:35.606]  I might piss you off.
[01:51:35.606 --> 01:51:36.967]  Like RFK Jr.
[01:51:36.967 --> 01:51:39.808]  Blew his father away right in front of him.
[01:51:39.808 --> 01:51:45.231]  Killed his uncle on national television.
[01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:46.472]  You think RFK Jr.
[01:51:46.472 --> 01:51:48.673]  is for real?
[01:51:48.673 --> 01:51:49.093]  I don't know.
[01:51:49.093 --> 01:51:51.534]  Somebody murders your daddy.
[01:51:51.534 --> 01:51:52.395]  Do you like him?
[01:51:52.395 --> 01:51:53.636]  Nah, come on.
[01:51:53.636 --> 01:51:56.037]  This thing is a lot more important than money and power.
[01:51:56.037 --> 01:51:59.279]  Like vengeance and vendettas.
[01:51:59.279 --> 01:51:59.459]  So...
[01:52:00.515 --> 01:52:07.098]  I mean, the stuff they've done to me makes me, I'll never give up and they haven't killed my family.
[01:52:07.098 --> 01:52:10.720]  They might've tried.
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:12.420]  So no, there's not just evil in the world, folks.
[01:52:12.420 --> 01:52:19.964]  There's not just Larry Fink and the Rockefellers and Obama, that joke.
[01:52:19.964 --> 01:52:25.806]  They have the money and the power and the media, but they don't have much else.
[01:52:25.806 --> 01:52:27.707]  They don't have your soul.
[01:52:27.707 --> 01:52:28.468]  They don't have your mind.
[01:52:28.468 --> 01:52:29.408]  They don't have your will.
[01:52:32.714 --> 01:52:36.295]  No, Tucker Carlson's now awake.
[01:52:36.295 --> 01:52:37.376]  Joe Rogan's now awake.
[01:52:37.376 --> 01:52:50.960]  We could talk for hours about all the people, the James Woods of the Worlds, and the Tulsi Gabbards, and the Russell Brands.
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:53.081]  Pretty much anybody popular is on our side.
[01:52:53.081 --> 01:52:57.803]  Because humans have a way about us when we finally get down, and we know we're about to go down.
[01:52:59.554 --> 01:53:01.456]  We just say, you know what?
[01:53:01.456 --> 01:53:04.439]  How about we just have a fight?
[01:53:04.439 --> 01:53:06.721]  Because that's said this a lot.
[01:53:06.721 --> 01:53:07.381]  I'll say it again.
[01:53:07.381 --> 01:53:11.385]  I don't know how all this is going to end.
[01:53:11.385 --> 01:53:14.628]  We didn't start this fight.
[01:53:14.628 --> 01:53:17.851]  And you knew World War people aren't backing down.
[01:53:17.851 --> 01:53:22.896]  So I guess if you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[01:53:22.896 --> 01:53:23.777]  That's what you're looking for.
[01:53:23.777 --> 01:53:24.578]  You came to the right place.
[01:53:29.704 --> 01:53:33.529]  The truth is, God has a sick sense of humor.
[01:53:33.529 --> 01:53:34.711]  And I get God.
[01:53:34.711 --> 01:53:35.993]  I don't judge God.
[01:53:35.993 --> 01:53:44.365]  So many people look at God giving us free will, and they see all the bad things that happen, and they see all the persecution and pain, and they say, God's a sadist.
[01:53:45.737 --> 01:53:47.958]  No, if anything, God's lonely.
[01:53:47.958 --> 01:53:56.260]  God made billions of creatures with free will and an understanding of the universe and the ability to interface with infinity.
[01:53:56.260 --> 01:54:03.862]  And I'm just thankful for the power I've been given and the will I've been given and the freedom I've been given to make that choice.
[01:54:03.862 --> 01:54:10.904]  And I just say to the Creator, beam me up, Master.
[01:54:14.209 --> 01:54:15.751]  You are so perfect.
[01:54:15.751 --> 01:54:16.671]  You are so good.
[01:54:16.671 --> 01:54:20.655]  I understand you.
[01:54:20.655 --> 01:54:23.358]  At least I think I do.
[01:54:23.358 --> 01:54:27.082]  I don't claim to understand God, but you know I understand God.
[01:54:27.082 --> 01:54:28.944]  I got God fear.
[01:54:28.944 --> 01:54:30.565]  And I just appreciate this.
[01:54:31.621 --> 01:54:44.225]  I've been put on this gorgeous planet in all this wonderful universe and I can experience beauty and culture and everything and just be alive and have my family and just, dude, this is amazing!
[01:54:44.225 --> 01:54:45.145]  Wow!
[01:54:45.145 --> 01:54:45.846]  Wow!
[01:54:45.846 --> 01:54:47.646]  What a ride!
[01:54:47.646 --> 01:54:48.887]  What an amusement park!
[01:54:48.887 --> 01:54:50.247]  What an incredible thing!
[01:54:50.247 --> 01:54:52.888]  And then, yeah, I go do bad stuff and it's your fault?
[01:54:54.591 --> 01:54:58.533]  Somebody else does something, so it's your fault for making us know.
[01:54:58.533 --> 01:55:00.914]  You gave us free will.
[01:55:00.914 --> 01:55:04.937]  Little g, not a God, little God.
[01:55:04.937 --> 01:55:06.397]  And some Christians don't like that.
[01:55:06.397 --> 01:55:08.899]  Fake Christians are like, that's blasphemy to say we're God.
[01:55:08.899 --> 01:55:13.181]  I didn't say I was God.
[01:55:13.181 --> 01:55:19.244]  Genesis says we are made in the image of God.
[01:55:19.244 --> 01:55:20.145]  Figure that out yet?
[01:55:24.969 --> 01:55:30.193]  So I do appreciate being made in the image of the creator.
[01:55:30.193 --> 01:55:36.017]  And I'm not prideful about it, I'm very humble about it, but I'm like, I'm gonna do whatever you're gonna tell me to do.
[01:55:36.017 --> 01:55:39.440]  By the way, just please take me with you.
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:40.641]  Oh, I get it.
[01:55:40.641 --> 01:55:42.522]  Oh, please.
[01:55:42.522 --> 01:55:43.543]  Let me do whatever.
[01:55:43.543 --> 01:55:45.505]  Oh, you don't like cowards?
[01:55:45.505 --> 01:55:48.947]  Well, you just tell me whatever I gotta do to prove I'm not one of those.
[01:55:48.947 --> 01:55:50.128]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:50.128 --> 01:55:51.349]  You tell me, jump.
[01:55:51.349 --> 01:55:52.390]  I say, how high?
[01:55:53.558 --> 01:55:55.359]  I'm gonna click my heels eight times.
[01:55:55.359 --> 01:55:56.420]  I'm gonna do it.
[01:55:56.420 --> 01:55:58.601]  You want me to get fed into a wood chipper?
[01:55:58.601 --> 01:56:01.763]  You want me to spend a trillion years in a hellhole?
[01:56:01.763 --> 01:56:07.307]  I'll do it because I've already had a little taste of the next level.
[01:56:07.307 --> 01:56:13.671]  Total completion, total victory, total understanding, mastery of everything.
[01:56:13.671 --> 01:56:17.313]  It's called God.
[01:56:17.313 --> 01:56:18.054]  And I'm the
[01:56:22.366 --> 01:56:25.248]  But nothing worth anything is free.
[01:56:25.248 --> 01:56:29.110]  Nothing that has value is easily gained.
[01:56:29.110 --> 01:56:30.491]  And that's what this is all about.
[01:56:30.491 --> 01:56:38.756]  So I want to play a disgusting clip, but first I want to take a piss.
[01:56:38.756 --> 01:56:45.040]  It's Aeropromo, and I'm going to come back with one of the most disgusting people I've ever met.
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:46.361]  And that's Sean Penn.
[01:56:46.361 --> 01:56:51.324]  I mean, you talk about an arrogant husk of a creature, a demon,
[01:56:52.762 --> 01:56:59.064]  Who wants World War III?
[01:56:59.064 --> 01:57:04.506]  Who now just said the quiet part aloud.
[01:57:04.506 --> 01:57:11.509]  He says the lockdowns are a mandatory rehearsal for things to come.
[01:57:11.509 --> 01:57:17.571]  This sick creature wants to lock you up because it makes him feel powerful.
[01:57:17.571 --> 01:57:20.972]  Where have we heard of that before?
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:26.482]  And I'm going to tell you why Sean Penn, you're so obsessed with locking us up.
[01:57:26.482 --> 01:57:31.305]  Because you're about to get your ass locked up culturally, spiritually.
[01:57:31.305 --> 01:57:35.267]  You're not going to get locked up in some cell.
[01:57:35.267 --> 01:57:38.669]  You're about to get locked up with people like you.
[01:57:38.669 --> 01:57:40.571]  Dimensionally.
[01:57:40.571 --> 01:57:45.614]  You're about to be cut off from the source.
[01:57:45.614 --> 01:57:49.316]  So that's why he spends all his time trying to claw us into his hell with him.
[01:57:52.130 --> 01:57:57.995]  Because the man is a retarded joke.
[01:57:57.995 --> 01:58:00.658]  I don't mean that meaning it's Down syndrome.
[01:58:00.658 --> 01:58:03.500]  I've had dinner with Sean Penn.
[01:58:03.500 --> 01:58:14.690]  The man, 16 years, 17, whatever it was, is a moron.
[01:58:14.690 --> 01:58:18.133]  But aren't the servants of the devil morons?
[01:58:20.956 --> 01:58:38.972]  He literally wants to starve you to death and make you eat bugs because it makes this goofus feel powerful.
[01:58:38.972 --> 01:58:40.213]  He's a retarded drug addict.
[01:58:45.029 --> 01:58:52.635]  But what does it say about us when we let retarded pedophile drug addicts like Joe Biden run our lives?
[01:58:52.635 --> 01:58:56.979]  God doesn't like that.
[01:58:56.979 --> 01:59:01.022]  You know who God hates more than cowards?
[01:59:01.022 --> 01:59:04.084]  People that don't take their destiny in their hands.
[01:59:04.084 --> 01:59:06.086]  People that don't love beauty.
[01:59:06.086 --> 01:59:07.327]  People that don't love strength.
[01:59:07.327 --> 01:59:12.371]  People that don't love the animating contest of liberty.
[01:59:15.290 --> 01:59:17.111]  And I am just so thankful to God.
[01:59:17.111 --> 01:59:20.994]  And I don't think our demonic enemies have any imagination.
[01:59:20.994 --> 01:59:40.907]  In fact, I know they don't because if they ever saw what I've seen, if they ever felt for one millisecond, the third heaven, it is, it is, it is, it is, it's heaven.
[01:59:40.907 --> 01:59:41.808]  That's why it's called that.
[01:59:43.567 --> 02:00:04.038]  It's not completion, it's not satisfaction, it's not ecstasy, it is timeless, total understanding and love, and a feeling of contentment that is so transformative to just bathe in the consciousness of the Creator.
[02:00:04.038 --> 02:00:05.539]  And it all makes sense.
[02:00:05.539 --> 02:00:08.181]  And I'm just blessed, because I unfortunately know this,
[02:00:09.733 --> 02:00:14.494]  Most people have not been as blessed as I've been to experience.
[02:00:14.494 --> 02:00:38.118]  I know there's higher levels, but what I've been given access to only five, six times is so good that I would spend trillions of years in hell to have one moment of this.
[02:00:38.118 --> 02:00:39.078]  And I've already been given it.
[02:00:43.629 --> 02:00:49.371]  Because I already experienced it when I was a very young child.
[02:00:49.371 --> 02:00:50.872]  Old space.
[02:00:50.872 --> 02:00:53.233]  Interdimensional level.
[02:00:53.233 --> 02:00:57.715]  That recurring dream was the gate being opened.
[02:00:57.715 --> 02:01:05.858]  But it wasn't until I did the work and stood against the enemy that it interdimensionally created enough charge
[02:01:08.106 --> 02:01:11.669]  To then break the wall and go to the next level.
[02:01:11.669 --> 02:01:22.378]  And that's why God does this, is because we've got to be persecuted by evil so that we can recognize the opposite of it.
[02:01:22.378 --> 02:01:25.701]  Because if you're just given something, you don't appreciate it.
[02:01:25.701 --> 02:01:27.262]  Everybody knows that.
[02:01:27.262 --> 02:01:34.889]  You've got to be shown the other side before you can be shown infinity.
[02:01:41.578 --> 02:01:42.498]  All right, let's play this clip.
[02:01:42.498 --> 02:01:45.099]  I'll come back and get to Sean Penn.
[02:01:45.099 --> 02:01:54.721]  Go to hell, New World Order.
[02:01:54.721 --> 02:01:57.482]  What kept you?
[02:01:57.482 --> 02:01:58.762]  We ran into some old friends.
[02:01:58.762 --> 02:01:59.842]  Is your ship all right?
[02:01:59.842 --> 02:02:05.324]  Seems okay if we can get to it.
[02:02:05.324 --> 02:02:10.165]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine.
[02:02:20.660 --> 02:02:25.323]  Harrison, visit InfoWars.com forward slash show now.
[02:02:25.323 --> 02:02:31.867]  I hope that old man got that tractor beam out of commission or this is going to be a real short trip.
[02:02:31.867 --> 02:02:32.308]  Okay, yes!
[02:02:33.834 --> 02:02:40.838]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:02:40.838 --> 02:02:44.040]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show today.
[02:02:59.657 --> 02:03:04.439]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:03:04.439 --> 02:03:09.342]  This has been an important two plus hour broadcast.
[02:03:09.342 --> 02:03:10.702]  And it's only here because of you.
[02:03:10.702 --> 02:03:12.343]  So I humbly appreciate you.
[02:03:12.343 --> 02:03:14.624]  I say that you should support the transmission.
[02:03:14.624 --> 02:03:21.147]  Go to DefendJones.com if you want to donate directly to me for legal and professional fees so I can stay on air.
[02:03:21.147 --> 02:03:25.109]  Free speeches.
[02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:26.529]  Got about 5% gas.
[02:03:28.902 --> 02:03:29.462]  Which is high.
[02:03:29.462 --> 02:03:31.403]  That's the highest we've been in the black in a few years.
[02:03:31.403 --> 02:03:33.845]  So we're about 5% above the red.
[02:03:33.845 --> 02:03:37.287]  M4's is somewhat halfway, barely stabilized.
[02:03:37.287 --> 02:03:38.828]  I have no money to pay my legal fees.
[02:03:38.828 --> 02:03:40.128]  The judge said I had to pay half of them.
[02:03:40.128 --> 02:03:40.969]  I don't have any money.
[02:03:40.969 --> 02:03:41.669]  They lied and said it.
[02:03:41.669 --> 02:03:46.172]  The judge said he's about to reverse that, or it looks like he is, but he signaled that.
[02:03:46.172 --> 02:03:48.433]  But you want me to fight somebody?
[02:03:48.433 --> 02:03:51.215]  I mean, I'm taking on the Democratic Party, the whole New World Order.
[02:03:51.215 --> 02:03:54.117]  Trump's already spent $67 million this year on lawyers.
[02:03:54.117 --> 02:03:56.378]  I've been in the last year, a million dollars in the hole.
[02:03:57.506 --> 02:04:01.648]  I want to thank all of you that went to DefendJones.com and made donations.
[02:04:01.648 --> 02:04:04.529]  Whether it's a dollar or a thousand dollars, you know who you are.
[02:04:04.529 --> 02:04:05.350]  You're in the fight.
[02:04:05.350 --> 02:04:07.891]  You've made the decision to take action.
[02:04:08.885 --> 02:04:15.490]  So defendjones.com, but separately, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula for your joints, your bones, your brain, your immune system.
[02:04:15.490 --> 02:04:16.791]  Strongest humanoid out there.

[02:04:18.132 --> 02:04:19.032]  It's back in stock.
[02:04:19.032 --> 02:04:20.073]  25% off.
[02:04:20.073 --> 02:04:22.355]  Superfinal Vitality is the same as the Male Vitality.
[02:04:22.355 --> 02:04:23.355]  It's just sold out.
[02:04:23.355 --> 02:04:24.876]  It's about to sell out too.
[02:04:24.876 --> 02:04:25.477]  60% off.
[02:04:25.477 --> 02:04:28.479]  All the great essential oil, fluoride-free toothpaste are there.
[02:04:28.479 --> 02:04:29.259]  The turmeric, the
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:34.644]  Tooth whitening and of course the actual charcoal toothpaste are there.
[02:04:34.644 --> 02:04:36.186]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:04:36.186 --> 02:04:40.710]  They have great 3,000 milligram CBD, the best highest quality you're going to find, the lowest price.
[02:04:40.710 --> 02:04:43.073]  1,000 milligram topical salve.
[02:04:43.073 --> 02:04:45.915]  It's all there and they're great products you need to fund the operation.
[02:04:45.915 --> 02:04:47.357]  That funds free speech and the crew.
[02:04:48.999 --> 02:04:53.642]  I have to come here and ask for your help because the court is still not approved.
[02:04:53.642 --> 02:04:56.525]  My salary, I've not been paid when I was supposed to be.
[02:04:56.525 --> 02:04:58.046]  I can't pay my legal bills.
[02:04:58.046 --> 02:04:59.867]  And so I am in your hands.
[02:04:59.867 --> 02:05:03.049]  You're making the decision whether to keep us on air or not.
[02:05:03.049 --> 02:05:07.052]  We have amazing products at Infowarsstore.com and you are literally changing history.
[02:05:07.052 --> 02:05:09.414]  The globalists are so angry.
[02:05:09.414 --> 02:05:10.154]  These aren't just words.
[02:05:10.154 --> 02:05:10.915]  Listen to me.
[02:05:10.915 --> 02:05:13.377]  They're so angry we're still on air.
[02:05:13.377 --> 02:05:15.919]  They're so upset that they haven't silenced us.
[02:05:16.653 --> 02:05:19.114]  Because they haven't broken your will.
[02:05:19.114 --> 02:05:20.915]  They haven't gotten you to give up.
[02:05:20.915 --> 02:05:22.956]  So spread the word, please.
[02:05:22.956 --> 02:05:23.597]  Share the article.
[02:05:23.597 --> 02:05:24.117]  Share the video.
[02:05:24.117 --> 02:05:24.577]  Share the clips.
[02:05:24.577 --> 02:05:25.077]  You're doing it.
[02:05:25.077 --> 02:05:25.838]  I see it.
[02:05:25.838 --> 02:05:27.158]  Intensify it.
[02:05:27.158 --> 02:05:28.019]  Call and talk radio.
[02:05:28.019 --> 02:05:28.499]  Plug the show.
[02:05:28.499 --> 02:05:29.380]  Whatever you got to do.
[02:05:29.380 --> 02:05:31.020]  It's having a big effect.
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:38.584]  Infowars and Alex Jones was right, and I'm very humble about this because I'm not perfect, but it's a rallying point that people are saying, you want to destroy this guy?
[02:05:38.584 --> 02:05:39.545]  We got his back.
[02:05:39.545 --> 02:05:41.666]  Thank you for myself, the crew, and my family.
[02:05:42.841 --> 02:05:48.866]  But please get products to keep InfoWars on air, plus get great products that empower your life at InfoWars.com.
[02:05:48.866 --> 02:05:52.069]  If you want to support me, go to defendjones.com.

[02:05:57.594 --> 02:06:00.017]  You get a free month there, jonescrowder.com.
[02:06:00.017 --> 02:06:01.418]  That's another way to support me.
[02:06:01.418 --> 02:06:03.099]  So two ways, jonescrowder.com.
[02:06:03.925 --> 02:06:12.168]  Get a free month and get all Steven Crowder's subscription shows and all those other shows and there's a bunch of free shows too, but go to JonesCrowder.com there.
[02:06:12.168 --> 02:06:14.109]  That's one way to support JonesCrowder.com.
[02:06:14.109 --> 02:06:17.751]  JonesCrowder.com and DefendJones.com.
[02:06:17.751 --> 02:06:18.831]  Thank you.
[02:06:18.831 --> 02:06:19.871]  You are my champions.
[02:06:19.871 --> 02:06:21.012]  You're the reason I'm here.
[02:06:21.012 --> 02:06:21.732]  Thank you to the crew.
[02:06:21.732 --> 02:06:23.193]  Thank you to everybody else.
[02:06:23.193 --> 02:06:25.414]  I'll see you back tomorrow, Lord willing.
[02:06:26.634 --> 02:06:27.135]  4 p.m.
[02:06:27.135 --> 02:06:33.160]  Central, Marjorie Taylor Greene in studio, the ADL Deep Dive and more, 4 p.m.
[02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:34.080]  Central, 5 p.m.
[02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:34.661]  Eastern.
[02:06:34.661 --> 02:06:35.702]  God bless and good luck!
[02:07:03.286 --> 02:07:08.290]  On March 20th, 2003, the United States invaded Iraq.
[02:07:08.290 --> 02:07:13.513]  Exactly one year before the invasion, Alex Jones predicted it.
[02:07:13.513 --> 02:07:16.275]  So now everybody's going, wow, it really was the Iraqis.
[02:07:16.275 --> 02:07:19.197]  That's just because they're getting ready to invade Iraq.
[02:07:19.197 --> 02:07:20.578]  What a beautiful setup.
[02:07:20.578 --> 02:07:27.183]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:07:27.183 --> 02:07:31.626]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[02:07:35.137 --> 02:07:36.538]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[02:07:36.538 --> 02:07:37.478]  I thought it was next week.
[02:07:37.478 --> 02:07:41.901]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[02:07:41.901 --> 02:07:44.142]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:07:44.142 --> 02:07:47.985]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[02:07:47.985 --> 02:07:49.866]  Overhead shot, please.
[02:07:49.866 --> 02:07:54.028]  Look how full this bottle is.
[02:07:54.028 --> 02:07:56.990]  Right to the top, folks.
[02:07:56.990 --> 02:07:59.552]  Right to the top with these 95% curcuminoid.
[02:08:02.822 --> 02:08:07.027]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[02:08:07.027 --> 02:08:09.029]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[02:08:09.029 --> 02:08:11.132]  This is 95%.
[02:08:11.132 --> 02:08:14.596]  Super constant.
[02:08:14.596 --> 02:08:18.480]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:19.962]  It's that powerful.
[02:08:19.962 --> 02:08:21.123]  Or more!
[02:08:21.123 --> 02:08:23.265]  So they're available at infowarstore.com.
[02:08:24.639 --> 02:08:35.007]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula, sold out for almost eight months, back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:36.588]  It's just a mask.
[02:08:36.588 --> 02:08:38.410]  It's just six feet.
[02:08:38.410 --> 02:08:40.972]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[02:08:40.972 --> 02:08:43.394]  It's just non-essential workers.
[02:08:43.394 --> 02:08:45.936]  It's just until we work it out.
[02:08:45.936 --> 02:08:47.457]  It's just a bar.
[02:08:47.457 --> 02:08:48.638]  It's just a restaurant.
[02:08:49.628 --> 02:08:51.509]  It's just nursing homes.
[02:08:51.509 --> 02:08:53.370]  It's just schools.
[02:08:53.370 --> 02:08:56.672]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[02:08:56.672 --> 02:08:59.254]  It's just until the cases go down.
[02:08:59.254 --> 02:09:01.515]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[02:09:01.515 --> 02:09:04.337]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[02:09:04.337 --> 02:09:06.779]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[02:09:06.779 --> 02:09:11.362]  It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events.
[02:09:11.362 --> 02:09:13.023]  It's just churches and mosques.
[02:09:13.823 --> 02:09:15.504]  It's just singing.
[02:09:15.504 --> 02:09:18.204]  It's just travel.
[02:09:18.204 --> 02:09:20.665]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[02:09:20.665 --> 02:09:22.626]  It's just for the greater good.
[02:09:22.626 --> 02:09:26.507]  It's just fact-checking, not censorship.
[02:09:26.507 --> 02:09:28.507]  It's just mandatory.
[02:09:28.507 --> 02:09:30.368]  It isn't just at all.
[02:09:30.368 --> 02:09:33.669]  Visit defendjones.com to help fight back today.
