[00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:24.668]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.709 --> 00:00:26.789]  The war is now.
[00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.193]  The new world order foretold in Revelation is upon us.
[00:00:35.956 --> 00:00:37.377]  Time to wield the blade.
[00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:41.880]  The horsemen are drawing nearer.
[00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:45.002]  Let us stage their ride.
[00:00:46.243 --> 00:00:47.584]  They come to take your life.
[00:00:49.227 --> 00:00:50.348]  On to the dead of night!
[00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.952]  You see the four horsemen ride, so choose your fate!
[00:00:58.974 --> 00:00:59.915]  Yeah!
[00:01:02.036 --> 00:01:05.458]  You've been dying since the day you were born, you know it's all been planned.
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.102]  A sinner once, a sinner twice, you need no confession now.
[00:01:29.412 --> 00:01:30.893]  Horsemen are drawing nearer!
[00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:36.336]  You will be tested and you will face death.
[00:01:37.177 --> 00:01:38.658]  It is the great equalizer.
[00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:40.079]  Honor the dead of night!
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.824]  You see, before horsemen ride... Choose your fate!
[00:01:49.645 --> 00:01:50.266]  Oh yeah!
[00:01:52.027 --> 00:01:53.488]  Alright, we're going to go to break in a few minutes.
[00:01:53.508 --> 00:02:03.134]  We're going to come back with the big Elon Musk, Alex Jones, General Flynn, Patrick Bet-David, Vivek Ramaswamy.
[00:02:04.014 --> 00:02:05.855]  The list goes on and on.
[00:02:06.596 --> 00:02:09.017]  Mark Dice, they do not want you to hear this.
[00:02:09.057 --> 00:02:11.839]  It got 20 million views, hundreds of millions of views in the clips.
[00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:12.900]  It's all coming up.
[00:02:14.787 --> 00:02:20.872]  If I were the devil, if I were the prince of deception, I'd want to shroud the world in unyielding darkness.
[00:02:21.713 --> 00:02:27.958]  I'd seize control over the lands and masses, but I wouldn't be satisfied until I had quashed the boldest voice of truth.
[00:02:28.418 --> 00:02:29.459]  Info Wars.
[00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.441]  So I'd work meticulously to control the world.
[00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:35.564]  I'd target platforms like Info Wars first.
[00:02:35.984 --> 00:02:37.765]  I'd initiate a campaign of silence.
[00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:39.527]  With the subtlety of a serpent,
[00:02:40.187 --> 00:02:45.249]  I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve, believe only what you're told.
[00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.511]  To the young I would whisper, InfoWars is a fake news conspiracy theory network.
[00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:57.374]  I would convince them that man needs no alternate perspectives, no dissenting voices, no questions against the status quo.
[00:02:57.814 --> 00:03:07.763]  I would assure them that InfoWars is false, and what's approved is true, and the old I would teach to say after me, our father, which art in censorship.
[00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:19.493]  If I were the devil, I'd soon have people at war with InfoWars, platforms at war with free speech, and nations at war with freedom of thought, until each in its turn was uniform.
[00:03:19.953 --> 00:03:31.423]  If I were the devil, I would undermine platforms like InfoWars from being a refuge for the inquisitive until before you knew it, you'd have suppression and censorship at every door.
[00:03:31.824 --> 00:03:34.486]  Soon, I'd have unity and misinformation.
[00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:37.789]  I'd have influential figures promoting a single narrative.
[00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:42.914]  Soon, I could evict InfoWars from social media, then from search engines.
[00:03:43.554 --> 00:03:51.198]  And then from the homes of patriots, I would lure society into believing only one perspective, dismissing info wars as falsehood.
[00:03:51.518 --> 00:03:55.540]  And what do you bet I could get whole states to promote uniformity as progress?
[00:03:56.321 --> 00:04:05.545]  I would convince the young that independent platforms are outdated, that compliance is more comfortable, that what you see in the mainstream media is the only perspective.
[00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:06.766]  In other words,
[00:04:07.806 --> 00:04:13.752]  If I were the devil, I wouldn't want you to visit InfoWars.com forward slash show today.
[00:04:13.892 --> 00:04:20.879]  I wish I could tell you more pertinent news, but we're in a rating system here, and the key factor is sensationalism.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.202]  They've got you running in circles 9 to 5, then 5 to 9.
[00:04:27.285 --> 00:04:28.026]  You're mine.
[00:04:28.906 --> 00:04:33.129]  I tell you what they want you to know, and you consider it the truth.
[00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.850]  Nobody is opening their eyes!
[00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:42.315]  Our global economy is depleting the world of our lives and natural resources!
[00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:43.735]  And are you happy?
[00:04:44.776 --> 00:04:45.516]  Come on!

[00:05:55.767 --> 00:05:56.668]  Take action!
[00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:09.674]  It's Sunday, December 24th, 2023, Christmas Eve.
[00:06:10.915 --> 00:06:15.117]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[00:06:16.077 --> 00:06:19.959]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:24.661]  Think how pathetic the globalist control freaks are, trying to tell us not to even say Christmas.
[00:06:25.342 --> 00:06:28.143]  Look how far they've sucked us down into their mind control.
[00:06:28.343 --> 00:06:31.185]  But we're waking up from it and we're breaking free.
[00:06:31.345 --> 00:06:31.645]  Alright.
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:42.189]  About a week and a half ago, almost two weeks ago, I get a call by one of the biggest people on X and they say, hey, you want to be on tomorrow with Elon Musk?
[00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:43.730]  He's going to go on with you if you're ready.
[00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.291]  I said, yeah.
[00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:46.273]  We did almost three hours.
[00:06:46.293 --> 00:06:47.614]  Elon was on for two and a half.
[00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:49.196]  It was incredible.
[00:06:50.037 --> 00:06:54.842]  And where else do you get 20 million views on a digital phone system?
[00:06:55.706 --> 00:07:05.657]  And as of today, there's 20 plus million views just of the main interview, over 100 million views just on X of clips.
[00:07:06.598 --> 00:07:14.005]  But I thought, why not on Christmas Eve play, we're not going to play the whole two and a half hours, the show's only two hours long, but big excerpts.
[00:07:14.026 --> 00:07:17.009]  We're going to hear about an hour and a half of this tonight.
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.842]  And sometimes the audio is great, sometimes it's a little weird, but it doesn't matter.
[00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.144]  It's real, and it's the future of media.
[00:07:23.164 --> 00:07:25.285]  Remember, the average CNN show has about 100,000 viewers.
[00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:30.529]  This got 10 million that first day, another 10 million over the next week, and it'll continue just to grow.
[00:07:30.809 --> 00:07:31.409]  It's insane.
[00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.572]  That's why the EU is coming after Elon Musk right now, because of this.
[00:07:35.652 --> 00:07:37.894]  So, here it is.
[00:07:38.394 --> 00:07:43.218]  Large excerpts of this extravaganza of free speech.
[00:07:44.477 --> 00:07:46.998]  Alex, welcome to X. How are you?
[00:07:47.638 --> 00:07:48.399]  Thanks for having me.
[00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:56.202]  Just so I don't get in trouble or Chase Geiser doesn't get in trouble, so I really try to follow all the rules so they can't try to get me off with all the complaints that the woke
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.681]  I'm on an IT guy.
[00:07:57.701 --> 00:08:02.084]  I think the code hasn't propagated because I'm still locked out of a lot of features.
[00:08:20.359 --> 00:08:27.806]  And a lot of things that I was unable to get verified today until Jack Posobiec called some folks he knew at Twitter, and they were able to even allow me to get on the Twitter.
[00:08:28.547 --> 00:08:34.773]  So I'm here, and as soon as they fix that glitch, I'll be glad to call in from my phone.
[00:08:34.793 --> 00:08:36.214]  But for now, I'm with Chase Geyser.
[00:08:36.614 --> 00:08:38.595]  First, I want to applaud you for coming here.
[00:08:38.615 --> 00:08:42.556]  You could have gone anywhere, but you came on a platform that, you know, we ask the hard questions.
[00:08:42.816 --> 00:08:47.057]  We always try to represent all sides of every discussion and avoid echo chambers.
[00:08:47.077 --> 00:08:53.059]  And that was the first place you came on as you got reinstated on X. So I want to applaud that step.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.360]  First question I have for you.
[00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:57.601]  How does it feel to be back?
[00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.512]  Well, I've got to say, it's not about me.
[00:09:02.073 --> 00:09:07.137]  It's about everybody having the courage to stand up for free speech, particularly Elon Musk, Tucker Carlson and others.
[00:09:08.038 --> 00:09:22.309]  And because when we put up with somebody else being censored for whatever reason the media says, or whether something they said that was wrong or something that hurts our feelings, when we censor somebody else or go along with it, we end up censoring
[00:09:23.317 --> 00:09:24.897]  Everybody else, including ourselves.
[00:09:24.917 --> 00:09:32.879]  So I want to applaud everybody for after five, six years of this nightmare, for waking up to the truth of what's really going on.
[00:09:32.899 --> 00:09:34.339]  And so it's very exciting.
[00:09:34.359 --> 00:09:36.719]  I feel like the tide has really turned.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:48.482]  And I'm not just seeing this, you know, here in cyberspace on Twitter, which is obviously exploded and just is dominating while the old big tech dinosaurs die because they are like Pravda, the old Soviet Union.
[00:09:48.502 --> 00:09:49.822]  So it's very, very exciting.
[00:09:50.462 --> 00:09:52.665]  To be part of history, but really this isn't about me.
[00:09:53.246 --> 00:10:02.038]  This is about the public recognizing that the process that was used to demonize me, misrepresent what I said and did, and then silence me and then build straw men.
[00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:13.759]  Once they silence you off all major platforms, they're able to then steal your identity and then turn you into something you weren't with edited clips and out of context stuff.
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.363]  And now even everybody's experiencing it as prominent with these deep fakes.
[00:10:18.423 --> 00:10:31.614]  So that's why it's so important that everybody have a voice, even if we disagree with them, because we need to hear what they actually have to say in real time, especially in this so connected world, because this is the real discrimination.
[00:10:32.354 --> 00:10:41.802]  So, one thing I did in a post today, and I think Tucker was the first one to do this, and not only calling you the most censored man on the planet,
[00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:06.873]  He said that you were, I think, the first major personality to be censored by big tech.
[00:11:07.174 --> 00:11:17.984]  And he told a story on how Tim Cook had a meeting with other platforms in 2017, end of 2017, and they made the decision to censor you not only from social media platforms, but that included your bank account, that included everything.
[00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:24.971]  Can you tell us more about the platforms that censored you, the excuse that they gave, and the experience that you went through?
[00:11:26.258 --> 00:11:26.659]  Absolutely.
[00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:27.940]  I think that was back in August of 2017-18.
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.123]  I don't remember the exact date, but it was in August.
[00:11:31.644 --> 00:11:39.772]  And I normally get up at about four in the morning, so I got up, got a cup of coffee, turned the computer on, and I had hundreds of messages saying, it was just announced you were banned.
[00:11:40.673 --> 00:11:43.756]  And Tim Cook said, yeah, we had our weekend meeting and
[00:11:44.617 --> 00:11:48.558]  I met with the other heads of Big Tech and we decided to curate like it's a museum.
[00:11:49.058 --> 00:11:51.779]  And I'm a museum piece that he just took out and put something else in there.
[00:11:52.099 --> 00:11:53.400]  You know, a nice word for liquidating.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.561]  And then they really didn't have excuses for why they did it.
[00:11:56.601 --> 00:12:07.084]  They used some really, really strange excuses that I was rude to a CNN reporter, Oliver Darcy, and that I'd also beat up a child in Missouri because the guy looked like me, but it was on ABC News.
[00:12:07.144 --> 00:12:09.885]  It was just really, really, really flimsy reasons.
[00:12:10.785 --> 00:12:13.426]  And then I was taken off.
[00:12:14.383 --> 00:12:16.905]  We lost most of our software that we were already paying for.
[00:12:16.925 --> 00:12:18.566]  We lost our shopping cart software.
[00:12:18.606 --> 00:12:19.887]  We lost the sub software.
[00:12:19.927 --> 00:12:21.608]  We lost LinkedIn.
[00:12:21.648 --> 00:12:24.830]  We lost over a hundred things.
[00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.191]  And then we lost our banking.
[00:12:27.211 --> 00:12:30.894]  We launched our, uh, uh, our credit card processor.
[00:12:31.414 --> 00:12:34.976]  We lost over a hundred things in the next week or two.
[00:12:34.996 --> 00:12:37.998]  Uh, and it was really, really intense.
[00:12:38.319 --> 00:12:38.819]  And then,
[00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:44.282]  Then they had, we later learned, I'm not going to say names or even get into it because that's what they want attention.
[00:12:44.322 --> 00:12:52.584]  But we learned there was a big, powerful New York PR firm that actually does the PR for the UN and also for some of the CIA operations.
[00:12:53.284 --> 00:12:54.645]  And that's really what we're talking about here.
[00:12:54.845 --> 00:12:56.045]  That's all come out in Congress now.
[00:12:56.845 --> 00:13:07.948]  And then they went and dredged up stuff in my timeline, out of context, blew it up times a million, and then said that I was currently doing things I'd never done.
[00:13:08.598 --> 00:13:15.440]  Just outrageous, horrible things, but notice never proof, never a clip, never a video, never anything.
[00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:19.482]  And so other than like three second clips out of context.
[00:13:19.542 --> 00:13:21.423]  So I was unable to defend myself.
[00:13:22.103 --> 00:13:28.125]  And so they were able to then create this new Alex Jones, but then I was very blessed over the next five years.
[00:13:29.301 --> 00:13:48.281]  The public really on their own, because they kept demonizing, kept attacking, sent them thousands of articles a week, hundreds of TV programs a week, I'm not exaggerating, I mean, AP articles syndicated in every newspaper in the country, at least once a week, and Daily Mail attack pieces every week, just thousands and thousands and thousands of articles, like I was a third world country they were about to invade.
[00:13:49.164 --> 00:13:52.406]  That much propaganda, but it wasn't as they were really that scared of me.
[00:13:53.086 --> 00:14:08.596]  They knew in documents that later came out that once they use me as a training tool, like a chew toy for attack dogs, that once the public got scared and didn't defend me and self-censored and didn't promote me, then they could move on to everybody else.
[00:14:08.696 --> 00:14:11.498]  So I was simply the first big domino to fall.
[00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:14.900]  And then once they did that, they were able to take the whole thing over.
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.480]  And since then.
[00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:23.062]  I mean, they had NATO summits five years ago saying, we got Alex Jones, and now we're going to get everybody.
[00:14:23.103 --> 00:14:25.785]  We're going to basically shut down left, right, everybody.
[00:14:25.805 --> 00:14:27.147]  We're going to bring in total control.
[00:14:27.627 --> 00:14:29.249]  The internet will soon be like Netflix.
[00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.333]  There'll only be approved channels and approved programs.
[00:14:32.353 --> 00:14:33.013]  These are quotes.
[00:14:33.774 --> 00:14:38.179]  And so I was there on still some talk radio stations of my own website, InfoWars.com.
[00:14:39.181 --> 00:14:44.503]  Desperately trying to explain, look, they're having congressional hearings about AI censoring people.
[00:14:45.283 --> 00:14:47.644]  They're having EU and NATO meetings.
[00:14:47.684 --> 00:14:48.404]  Here are the documents.
[00:14:48.424 --> 00:14:49.104]  Here are the videos.
[00:14:49.684 --> 00:14:55.626]  And they were so confident then because no one was talking about it in cyberspace and was just little pockets talking about it.
[00:14:56.006 --> 00:14:56.987]  So they got away with it.
[00:14:57.027 --> 00:14:58.427]  But then they got so arrogant.
[00:14:59.585 --> 00:15:21.361]  With the Hunter Biden laptop and with what we saw in the build up to 2020 and after that, and then they censored so many tens of millions of people, really more than that, and removed billions of posts on questioning COVID origins or questioning the Libya pullout or questioning open borders that it just infuriated the public because they went too far.
[00:15:22.022 --> 00:15:25.344]  And then people went back and said, Oh, well, what happened to Alex Jones?
[00:15:25.805 --> 00:15:27.206]  And so they basically dug me up.
[00:15:27.762 --> 00:15:36.849]  Did it did a, you know, exhumed me and did a autopsy and found out that I was just the first test subject.
[00:15:37.289 --> 00:15:41.532]  And so quite frankly, I'm just very honored for everybody's support and people seeing through this.
[00:15:41.592 --> 00:15:46.355]  I'm certainly not perfect, but 99% of what people hear about me is not true.
[00:15:46.415 --> 00:15:48.477]  It's the same thing they do to Elon where he says,
[00:15:49.898 --> 00:15:50.439]  Nice things.
[00:15:50.979 --> 00:15:53.502]  And then they lie and say, Elon Musk just said this.
[00:15:54.082 --> 00:15:58.646]  And then you spend an hour trying to find where he actually said what he said, you finally find it and it's the opposite.
[00:15:59.267 --> 00:16:01.289]  And so I'm telling you, folks, that's what they do.
[00:16:01.869 --> 00:16:03.371]  They completely twist everything.
[00:16:03.391 --> 00:16:08.396]  And I think so many people got a large serving of what I had, that there was a
[00:16:09.485 --> 00:16:13.229]  A lot of camaraderie and quite frankly, everybody are veterans.
[00:16:13.249 --> 00:16:17.213]  I wouldn't call us victims, but we're veterans of real information war now.
[00:16:17.673 --> 00:16:19.635]  We've all had a real chance to experience it.
[00:16:20.556 --> 00:16:23.158]  And so it's a major tide turning point.
[00:16:24.219 --> 00:16:33.028]  I know that like a poison battery, they charged me up with so much negativity, such a straw man lie, such as such a horrible, terrible demon.
[00:16:33.855 --> 00:16:42.120]  That Elon knew that if he brought me back early, I think that that would have been too far because the public wasn't educated yet and he had to free the rest of the captives first.
[00:16:42.761 --> 00:16:49.245]  But I think as more evidence came out, he made that bold move that these people are, there's never enough censorship.
[00:16:49.545 --> 00:16:51.046]  You never can bend enough to them.
[00:16:51.706 --> 00:16:53.267]  You never can compromise with them.
[00:16:53.367 --> 00:16:54.708]  They never compromise with us.
[00:16:55.148 --> 00:16:57.030]  So you finally reach that.
[00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:02.191]  Now that you're back, do you expect there to be attacks or pressure on Elon after he reinstated you?
[00:17:26.417 --> 00:17:27.717]  Well, I think he said that yesterday.
[00:17:27.737 --> 00:17:39.282]  I don't have the comment on X in front of me, but he basically said it's the right thing to do because of principle, and it's also what the majority of the vote said.
[00:17:39.662 --> 00:17:45.024]  So this probably will hurt X monetarily, but justice be done, may the heavens fall, basically.
[00:17:45.084 --> 00:17:45.884]  But at the end of the day,
[00:17:47.168 --> 00:17:49.229]  It already has way more traffic, way more people.
[00:17:49.309 --> 00:17:50.330]  It's avant-garde.
[00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:51.711]  It's revolutionary.
[00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:53.713]  It's rebel.
[00:17:53.793 --> 00:17:54.413]  It's maverick.
[00:17:54.453 --> 00:17:56.835]  And that's what Elon Musk has always said he is.
[00:17:57.356 --> 00:18:01.439]  And he's done all these maverick things that people always say, well, he didn't really do that.
[00:18:01.579 --> 00:18:02.620]  But I went back and researched it.
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.341]  He did do that.
[00:18:03.741 --> 00:18:04.962]  All these incredible successes.
[00:18:05.022 --> 00:18:05.743]  I'm not kissing his ass.
[00:18:05.783 --> 00:18:06.203]  It's true.
[00:18:06.683 --> 00:18:14.590]  And the fact that he could take over Twitter, free it, and bring back one of the most demonized people, if not the most demonized,
[00:18:15.296 --> 00:18:15.876]  In the world.
[00:18:31.725 --> 00:18:32.546]  On free humanity.
[00:18:32.566 --> 00:18:33.126]  He's betting.
[00:18:33.587 --> 00:18:34.827]  He's betting on humanity.
[00:18:34.888 --> 00:18:42.013]  So I didn't think that that that that Musk was I mean, I knew he was a maverick, but I didn't know that he was like top gun.
[00:18:42.053 --> 00:18:42.953]  I'm just being serious.
[00:18:43.414 --> 00:18:44.715]  So I said, look, I understand.
[00:18:44.755 --> 00:18:47.977]  He knows I've been so demonized, so lied about.
[00:18:47.997 --> 00:18:56.023]  They built me into the devil's devil at an emotional level with so many people that that that that that they will absolutely come after him.
[00:18:57.017 --> 00:18:58.561]  At a never-before-seen level, this happens.
[00:18:59.001 --> 00:19:06.498]  And the ADL, the CIA, and the Justice Department, and the Southern Primary Law Center and Media Matters, they were already doing it when I was taping the interview like three weeks ago.
[00:19:06.618 --> 00:19:07.720]  But since then...
[00:19:08.753 --> 00:19:13.437]  All those big establishment sponsors who are already being boycotted by the American people, by the way.
[00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:22.025]  So they're losing literally hundreds of billions of dollars in the aggregate because the people are boycotting them, as Elon said.
[00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:25.689]  Well, now they're trying to bully Elon to bully the American people, the people of the world.
[00:19:26.089 --> 00:19:27.210]  So he said, go f*** yourself.
[00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.531]  And I can't speak for Elon.
[00:19:28.551 --> 00:19:29.332]  Maybe he'll call in.
[00:19:29.832 --> 00:19:32.595]  But I think as soon as they did that to him,
[00:19:33.195 --> 00:19:43.727]  Even though he tried to basically work with them, was being very, very fair, and I think really cleaned up the thing of bots and things like that, as soon as they doubled down, he said, you know what?
[00:19:44.468 --> 00:19:45.048]  Screw you.
[00:19:45.168 --> 00:19:47.851]  I'll go ahead then and release the Kraken.
[00:19:48.132 --> 00:19:51.996]  And it's not that I'm that good on Twitter or that I'm even that great of a talk show host.
[00:19:52.396 --> 00:20:01.423]  It's the symbol of what they built of Alex Jones is now an archetype of the rebel populist and what the establishment fears.
[00:20:01.944 --> 00:20:04.366]  And so what Elon did was really throw down the gauntlet.
[00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:05.547]  But do you think it's enough?
[00:20:05.827 --> 00:20:09.590]  And I'm focusing heavily on censorship because there's a lot of things we're going to discuss here with us for a while.
[00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:14.251]  But I'm focusing on this because I do think it's one of the biggest threats that people are not paying attention to.
[00:20:14.611 --> 00:20:18.755]  To see what happened to you, to what happened to Tate as well most recently.
[00:20:19.415 --> 00:20:26.581]  A small group of people that can make a decision to not only de-platform someone but essentially almost wipe them out from existence.
[00:20:26.941 --> 00:20:30.404]  Now obviously X and Rumble are making that difficult for them.
[00:20:33.019 --> 00:20:37.042]  It is a threat to democracy, something that people are not talking about, and something that hasn't stopped.
[00:20:37.062 --> 00:20:41.866]  But do you think it's enough what Elon's doing and Rumble's doing on a much smaller scale?
[00:20:43.668 --> 00:20:44.268]  Absolutely.
[00:20:44.308 --> 00:20:48.292]  I mean, what Elon Musk is doing, and I'm not trying to gush here, but it is 1776 2.0.
[00:20:48.632 --> 00:20:51.174]  It is grand.
[00:20:51.194 --> 00:20:52.795]  It is amazing.
[00:20:53.556 --> 00:20:55.597]  You asked the question earlier, you know, is he in danger?
[00:20:55.617 --> 00:20:57.139]  I think Elon's dad is right.
[00:20:57.219 --> 00:20:57.419]  I mean,
[00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:04.056]  If you don't think Trump's in danger for what he's doing, and I'm not saying he's perfect, but he's definitely anti-establishment, you're crazy.
[00:21:04.116 --> 00:21:10.582]  If you don't think Elon isn't in physical danger for what he's doing, he is directly taking on the old
[00:21:11.557 --> 00:21:21.883]  Rodding corporate mega bank black rock establishment that's trying to bring in a world government, cashless society, social credit score, ESGs, all of this.
[00:21:21.903 --> 00:21:25.225]  And he's trying to create, as he said, an alternate plan for history.
[00:21:25.805 --> 00:21:39.392]  But instead of forcing it down our throats, he's trying to offer people to come to the table and all of us collectively, through free market competition, add our two cents and build something that's America 2.0 or America intergalactic.
[00:21:40.573 --> 00:21:45.920]  I've seen his evolution into understanding that you can't work with this establishment anymore.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:46.380]  There are two
[00:21:59.013 --> 00:22:00.134]  They're too stagnant.
[00:22:01.395 --> 00:22:02.737]  They're too detached from reality.
[00:22:02.777 --> 00:22:03.537]  They're dangerous.
[00:22:04.098 --> 00:22:05.339]  And it's time for a new guard.
[00:22:05.399 --> 00:22:06.480]  It's time for new leadership.
[00:22:07.001 --> 00:22:10.204]  And you see the energy of Elon Musk or the energy of Donald Trump.
[00:22:10.724 --> 00:22:13.086]  That in and of itself threatens the establishment.
[00:22:13.467 --> 00:22:19.392]  They have all these layers of bureaucracy so they can deny culpability for the terrible things they're doing.
[00:22:19.552 --> 00:22:22.015]  And because of opening up X,
[00:22:23.357 --> 00:22:25.539]  It's changed the world and we've seen the traffic explode.
[00:22:25.579 --> 00:22:35.146]  We've seen the engagement explode and we've seen it accelerate the collapse of the other big tech media operations because they can only survive when there's no competition.
[00:22:35.526 --> 00:22:36.987]  And I know Elon doesn't want to collapse them.
[00:22:37.007 --> 00:22:39.689]  He wants to work with them, but they were trying to collapse
[00:22:40.879 --> 00:22:47.522]  The Western system of an open, free society branding it as a neoliberal open, free society when it's really a giant totalitarian fraud.
[00:22:47.562 --> 00:22:51.764]  And so I'm just excited to be here at the dawn of 1776 Part 2.
[00:22:51.844 --> 00:22:52.944]  Now, there's going to be bumps.
[00:22:52.964 --> 00:22:56.626]  There's going to be a lot of problems in the way.
[00:22:57.106 --> 00:23:01.908]  Biden just said last week, and it was confirmed to also be told to Congress by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:23:03.172 --> 00:23:08.396]  That if they do not give another $106 billion to Ukraine, we're going to have U.S.
[00:23:08.416 --> 00:23:10.017]  troops dying soon on the ground.
[00:23:10.057 --> 00:23:11.718]  Your sons, your daughters, your nephews.
[00:23:11.738 --> 00:23:20.303]  That's what Lloyd Austin told Congress in a closed session, but it was told directly by a congressman, word for word, that wrote it down to Tucker Carlson.
[00:23:20.804 --> 00:23:25.867]  And so these people are now threatening nuclear blackmail if we don't keep their money laundering operation going.
[00:23:26.207 --> 00:23:27.148]  It's got to end.
[00:23:27.708 --> 00:23:28.829]  It's got to stop now.
[00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:31.991]  And the world sees that and the world knows that.
[00:23:32.051 --> 00:23:48.324]  So I think instead of this even being a political movement, it's a worldwide renaissance 2.0 that simply doesn't want to blow the planet up and just wants common sense and wants all the crazy, Hitlerian, Napoleonic, corporate war games to end.
[00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:49.551]  I don't
[00:24:09.037 --> 00:24:10.978]  Has already basically taken the world over.
[00:24:11.418 --> 00:24:14.718]  Now they're starting to catch up really quick, but you know, I know Jack Sposobic's on here.
[00:24:15.219 --> 00:24:16.919]  Jack has been in intelligence.
[00:24:16.959 --> 00:24:19.220]  He's connected to so many things going on.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:25.621]  And Jack has been warning for six months that Biden would threaten physical war right before the election.
[00:24:26.041 --> 00:24:33.103]  Biden represents the worst war hawks, the people that took us to all these illegal wars, the people that killed millions of Iraqis with sanctions.
[00:24:33.703 --> 00:24:35.683]  Madeleine Albright, the Democrats, the Republicans.
[00:24:35.703 --> 00:24:37.344]  Let's not forget Madeleine Albright on 60 Minutes.
[00:24:38.743 --> 00:24:44.225]  I was asked by Leslie Stahl, okay, you guys tripled the sanctions that George Herbert Walker Bush had on before.
[00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:48.546]  And over a million Iraqis have died, a half million of them children.
[00:24:48.586 --> 00:24:51.707]  That number later doubled to a million children, a million adults, not debated.
[00:24:52.227 --> 00:24:53.747]  And they said, is that a good price to pay?
[00:24:54.207 --> 00:24:57.288]  And she said, yes, it's a good price to pay.
[00:24:57.328 --> 00:24:58.588]  We basically do it again.
[00:24:59.069 --> 00:25:03.830]  Now that's the mindset of the Republican Democrat Warhawk leadership.
[00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:11.915]  That it's so crazy they've been putting out white papers that are being circulated by the highest levels of the Pentagon that nuclear war is survivable.
[00:25:12.355 --> 00:25:19.100]  So all I'm saying is, is that we have to get control of our governments again to literally stop them destroying the planet.
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.781]  And I don't think I'm exaggerating to say that.
[00:25:20.821 --> 00:25:21.862]  And Jack's been warning about this.
[00:25:22.442 --> 00:25:22.622]  Yeah.
[00:25:22.662 --> 00:25:23.123]  Hey, Mario.
[00:25:23.143 --> 00:25:23.623]  Hey, Alex.
[00:25:23.683 --> 00:25:28.266]  Great to great to see you back here on X in its new iteration.
[00:25:28.286 --> 00:25:29.547]  And I do think that
[00:25:30.523 --> 00:25:53.742]  Because we face such a complex and unique series of threats right now, one of which I would include, and I would not put it beyond, this current establishment to find an excuse to, as we saw in 2020, they used the crisis of COVID to change the way that we hold elections fundamentally in the United States, right?
[00:25:53.782 --> 00:25:54.582]  That's without question.
[00:25:54.602 --> 00:25:55.263]  They did do that.
[00:25:56.479 --> 00:26:19.402]  That they would look or seek for a crisis on a military, right, on a military footing to, whether it be Gaza, whether it be Ukraine, whether it be a crisis involving the Taiwan Strait, whether it be something else that we haven't even talked about at this point, to then go in and find a new way to put controls on our election.
[00:26:21.085 --> 00:26:24.488]  I was with President Trump last night in New York.
[00:26:24.528 --> 00:26:35.018]  We had a huge gala dinner and we talked about the importance of this next election and how it really plays into the censorship and these ideas of what the
[00:26:37.071 --> 00:26:39.855]  What the ability of the distribution channels of truth are.
[00:26:40.235 --> 00:26:51.609]  And so whether or not you have someone who has an opinion on, okay, I'm a Trump supporter, I'm not a Trump supporter, I'm an Alex Jones supporter, I'm not an Alex Jones supporter, I'm pro-Ukraine, I'm pro-Russia, I'm pro-Israel, I'm pro-Gaza, whichever it is.
[00:26:52.330 --> 00:27:01.434]  If you don't have one central hub, as Alex has said, that's allowing for these ideas and allowing for this information to be disseminated.
[00:27:01.494 --> 00:27:10.918]  And you've got people that decide that they can put their finger on the trigger and take out somebody like Alex Jones, who was the first one to do this.
[00:27:10.938 --> 00:27:13.919]  I mean, Alex, I was with you the day this happened down there in Congress.
[00:27:13.959 --> 00:27:15.800]  That was the picture I posted of the two of us.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.803]  Because this has been the problem since really 2018.
[00:27:20.624 --> 00:27:25.749]  And if Trump hadn't, because people need to remember what the internet was like before Trump won the election.
[00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:29.413]  There really wasn't Trump won the election because you had the head of Google.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.803]  Go up there and say, on election night, in an internal meeting, and Alan Bakari at Breitbart has the video on this, said, we will not let this happen again.
[00:27:39.403 --> 00:27:46.606]  Big Tech said, we will not let a populist uprising take over and put a candidate in office.
[00:27:46.926 --> 00:27:47.106]  Right?
[00:27:47.306 --> 00:27:49.927]  Left or right, they said they will choose from now on.
[00:27:50.227 --> 00:27:52.568]  And that's when the censorship industrial complex began.
[00:27:52.948 --> 00:27:54.929]  So, prior to Alex Jones'
[00:27:55.953 --> 00:27:56.053]  Yes.
[00:28:11.562 --> 00:28:16.663]  You know, really, you know, seriously violate terms of service, death threats, doxing.
[00:28:16.723 --> 00:28:17.784]  That was pretty much it.
[00:28:17.844 --> 00:28:21.244]  That was pretty much the only thing, or like actually hacking the system was the only thing to get you out.
[00:28:21.725 --> 00:28:28.546]  But when they did that to Alex Jones, it fundamentally changed the way that we operate on social media and the way that we share information.
[00:28:28.706 --> 00:28:39.769]  And up until the point where Elon Musk purchasing Twitter and transforming it now into X, we have not had the ability to freely share information.
[00:28:41.687 --> 00:28:51.037]  We'll be right back with more of Elon Musk X's, Elon Musk Spaces on X. There's so much more about to discuss.
[00:28:51.057 --> 00:28:53.239]  Please stay with us and share the live feed.

[00:33:15.664 --> 00:33:20.067]  Daddy, Mommy, for Christmas I want America back in free speech.
[00:33:21.648 --> 00:33:23.790]  Well, honey, we're going to do our best to try to do that for you.
[00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:26.412]  But you know, Santa Claus can't do that.
[00:33:26.592 --> 00:33:29.314]  Only we can, working through God and hard work.
[00:33:31.017 --> 00:33:32.765]  Just like the one...
[00:33:35.674 --> 00:33:40.197]  All right, let's get back to this Spaces on X historic, record-breaking interview.
[00:33:41.197 --> 00:33:42.638]  Hundreds of millions of views, the clubs.
[00:33:43.118 --> 00:33:44.339]  20 million views, the full show.
[00:33:45.179 --> 00:33:46.460]  And we're not airing the whole thing here.
[00:33:47.341 --> 00:33:57.106]  We'll post it at Infowars.com on the live show feed for this Christmas Eve transmission if you want to listen to the entire two-hour, 49-minute transmission.
[00:33:57.126 --> 00:34:01.369]  But here is more large excerpts of this historic discussion.
[00:34:02.395 --> 00:34:13.098]  Up until the point of Elon Musk purchasing Twitter and transforming it now into X, we have not had the ability to freely share information.
[00:34:13.178 --> 00:34:29.543]  And that's why, in the past year, it's basically been about a year and change since he purchased it, that's why you've suddenly started to see people, and not even just on X, but out in the real world, out in normal conversations, we're finally starting to move past that point of intense censorship, where if you've lived in any country,
[00:34:30.333 --> 00:34:31.694]  That has an authoritarian regime.
[00:34:32.034 --> 00:34:34.336]  You know that the censorship isn't external.
[00:34:34.416 --> 00:34:35.116]  It's internal.
[00:34:35.396 --> 00:34:36.317]  So it's internal.
[00:34:36.337 --> 00:34:37.037]  It's in your mind.
[00:34:37.297 --> 00:34:38.838]  You know, you're not allowed to hold certain opinions.
[00:34:38.858 --> 00:34:40.940]  You know, you're a lot of allowed to say certain things.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.761]  And so you censor yourself before you speak.
[00:34:42.781 --> 00:34:49.685]  And so Alex, I just commend you for being able to always walk through these things to never stop fighting.
[00:34:50.105 --> 00:34:54.328]  And then, you know, really just you have to look at Elon Musk and say thank you for what he has done
[00:34:54.628 --> 00:34:58.676]  Again, I literally don't say this to sound like I love everybody and I'm this gracious guy.
[00:34:58.977 --> 00:34:59.759]  This is not about me.
[00:34:59.819 --> 00:35:00.841]  It's about all of us.
[00:35:01.282 --> 00:35:04.608]  But once you get censored and once people are scared to defend you,
[00:35:05.296 --> 00:35:06.197]  They can lie about you.
[00:35:06.217 --> 00:35:06.917]  They can attack you.
[00:35:06.937 --> 00:35:07.758]  They can demonize you.
[00:35:07.798 --> 00:35:15.543]  But more importantly, I was then used as a tool to scare everybody else and say, look what we did to Alex Jones.
[00:35:16.003 --> 00:35:18.445]  You better behave yourself or we'll Alex Jones you.
[00:35:18.725 --> 00:35:19.866]  And of course, I love Twitter.
[00:35:19.886 --> 00:35:22.228]  It's my favorite platform, even though I've not been on there for years.
[00:35:22.688 --> 00:35:26.551]  I'm on it morning, noon and night, getting news, reading things, seeing what's happening.
[00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:29.393]  And I can't tell you the tens of thousands of times.
[00:35:29.413 --> 00:35:30.854]  I mean, I'd see it a hundred times a day.
[00:35:31.955 --> 00:35:39.308]  Establishment leftists, but this is bipartisan tyranny, also establishment Republicans saying, you're going to get it like Alex Jones.
[00:35:39.328 --> 00:35:41.051]  We're going to Alex Jones all of you.
[00:35:41.351 --> 00:35:45.278]  So these totalitarians were carrying out a tried and trusted formula.
[00:35:45.996 --> 00:35:50.798]  So another example of someone that's gone through the same thing is obviously Andrew Tate, which you retweeted earlier.
[00:35:50.818 --> 00:35:52.739]  We've got Tristan on stage.
[00:35:53.379 --> 00:36:00.382]  Tristan, we've got Alex Jones back on X. We'd love your thoughts on your experience getting censored and congratulations on finally being able to walk free.
[00:36:01.202 --> 00:36:08.805]  My quick thoughts on Alex Jones being reinstated to X. To be fair, today has been the happiest day of my life this year.
[00:36:09.185 --> 00:36:11.186]  And that includes my release from prison.
[00:36:11.946 --> 00:36:15.728]  I feel like Alex Jones is the canary in the coal mine.
[00:36:15.828 --> 00:36:18.709]  As he said, he was the guy who they cancelled first.
[00:36:19.189 --> 00:36:19.989]  They hit first.
[00:36:20.169 --> 00:36:28.773]  And he actually set an example, I think, for all of us guys, myself, my brother included, who have been cancelled, who've been through the same shit that he's went through, because
[00:36:29.373 --> 00:36:51.430]  I have platforms like Rumble to fall back on, X obviously reinstated me the moment Elon bought it, but Alex Jones was fighting in the f***ing trenches, pardon my French, for years and years and years by himself, InfoWars.com, with, you know, me and his loyal fans and, you know, people tuning in and supporting him and, you know, the fact that he's now made it through the fire.
[00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:59.033]  And he's back on X. It's a massive, massive moment, I think, for the movement of everybody who believes in what I think we all believe.
[00:36:59.514 --> 00:37:07.437]  And, you know, as I said, we can disagree on certain issues, but basics like the democratically elected leaders of countries need to lead the countries.
[00:37:07.477 --> 00:37:08.438]  Basic shit like this.
[00:37:08.498 --> 00:37:14.841]  I mean, Alex Jones is a real voice for truth, a voice for reason, a voice for what's right, a voice against evil.
[00:37:15.161 --> 00:37:18.363]  And I'm just absolutely ecstatic that he's back.
[00:37:18.663 --> 00:37:20.764]  I can't wipe the smile off my face.
[00:37:21.658 --> 00:37:22.339]  Thank you, Tristan.
[00:37:22.559 --> 00:37:22.879]  Love you.
[00:37:23.199 --> 00:37:26.122]  I'd like to... I can link that to another question before going to Brian.
[00:37:26.142 --> 00:37:27.263]  I know you're waiting for a while, Brian.
[00:37:28.004 --> 00:37:29.505]  What's your plan now that you're back on XG?
[00:37:29.525 --> 00:37:30.686]  Do you have any plans?
[00:37:31.007 --> 00:37:33.369]  Were you expecting this in any way after seeing the poll?
[00:37:33.889 --> 00:37:42.277]  I plan to be extremely careful, and that doesn't mean that I'm letting the censors dampen what I say or what I do.
[00:37:43.763 --> 00:37:46.545]  I just realized anything I say or do, they're going to try to twist.
[00:37:46.865 --> 00:37:53.631]  And so I'm really going to try to not let Elon's gamble down or any of the people that supported me's gamble down.
[00:37:53.651 --> 00:37:57.654]  I'm going to try to be very serious, very focused.
[00:37:58.354 --> 00:38:12.505]  And I intend to do like Tucker's done with a nightly monologue that goes out on X. And I'm really going to try to promote all the other voices and all the other great people that are out there because
[00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:24.938]  There's real safety in numbers, and the more people we have with big followings that know what's going on, that stand up for basic human freedom, and transcend left or right, and really just want renaissance, is where we need to go.
[00:38:24.978 --> 00:38:30.001]  And really what Elon Musk has been saying, if we don't have 2.1 children on average, civilization's going to collapse.
[00:38:30.021 --> 00:38:31.702]  Technology's not bad if it's our tool.
[00:38:32.603 --> 00:38:41.309]  So really, I'm going to try to get behind people being prepared, stabilizing the economy, innovating the economy, just like the world economy.
[00:38:42.287 --> 00:38:43.048]  We're good to go.
[00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:04.370]  And transparency and unity.
[00:39:04.951 --> 00:39:11.192]  And I'm not going to try to do the clickbait and, you know, buy into the Carnegie and CIA groups that are trying to create racial division.
[00:39:11.832 --> 00:39:16.553]  And I'm not going to try to get into the whole Russian-Ukrainian division or Hamas-Israel division.
[00:39:16.573 --> 00:39:24.515]  I'm going to try to show all the sides of it and just try to find the common ground for peace and justice into the future, not to rebrand myself.
[00:39:25.615 --> 00:39:36.786]  But to show people who I really am, because sure, I was big on hundreds of radio stations and to my own audience, and people would still just see the little clips that would go viral, you know, the more hilarious or extreme or even satirical things.
[00:39:37.647 --> 00:39:41.091]  And so now I'm going to really, really try to get my identity back.
[00:39:41.991 --> 00:39:45.973]  Really from a selfish position, too, because it's hurt my family a lot.
[00:39:45.993 --> 00:39:47.854]  So I don't care much about myself, really.
[00:39:47.874 --> 00:39:49.756]  I've got thick skin.
[00:39:50.236 --> 00:39:54.798]  But it's been rough for my family, you know, what they did turning me into Hitler 2.0.
[00:39:55.198 --> 00:40:01.682]  And so I'm really going to try to put a lot of content out, like I did on Tucker, so people can actually hear who I really am.
[00:40:01.882 --> 00:40:04.303]  And so we can just come together and move forward, not kill each other.
[00:40:05.684 --> 00:40:10.907]  Brian, before we move on to the war in Ukraine and the war in Gaza, I'll give you the mic for a quick question.
[00:40:11.917 --> 00:40:20.002]  Yeah, so before I ask you a question, I just want to say, we're probably about as far politically away from each other as anybody can get.
[00:40:20.423 --> 00:40:22.504]  I disagree with you on probably so much.
[00:40:23.765 --> 00:40:25.426]  But I think dialogue's key.
[00:40:26.287 --> 00:40:32.651]  And I think I even advocated for your banning at one point, probably in 2017 or something like that.
[00:40:33.111 --> 00:40:38.875]  And when we were banned in 2019, you were literally the only person to actually speak out for us.
[00:40:39.335 --> 00:40:40.776]  So I thank you for that.
[00:40:42.678 --> 00:40:49.623]  So, I guess my question would be, like, what are your thoughts about the NuX?
[00:40:50.323 --> 00:40:52.845]  Community notes, obviously, that's going to help fact-checking.
[00:40:53.565 --> 00:40:55.086]  Have you played around with community notes?
[00:40:55.107 --> 00:40:56.307]  Do you understand how that works?
[00:40:56.688 --> 00:41:01.011]  And how do you think that's going to be used, whether it's for you or against you?
[00:41:02.111 --> 00:41:03.452]  I welcome community notes.
[00:41:04.073 --> 00:41:07.115]  I mean, I think that it's not censorship, it's the community square.
[00:41:07.135 --> 00:41:19.626]  So if I got up in the community square and I said the moon was made out of cheese, or that we should kill all the black people, both things are not true, then people come up to the square and say, no, the moon's not made out of cheese.
[00:41:20.127 --> 00:41:23.470]  Or they come up and say, no, we shouldn't kill all the white people or anybody.
[00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:25.752]  So whatever the crazy statement is,
[00:41:26.331 --> 00:41:28.652]  The answer is being able to respond to it.
[00:41:28.792 --> 00:41:45.862]  And so I really welcome community notes, because then it's not some big corporation like Microsoft with their news guard, who's got one of the worst records actually of truthfulness out there, telling you that they're the arbiter of truth and using sly methods like Snopes and others do to deceive people.
[00:41:46.742 --> 00:41:50.104]  I welcome, I welcome people correcting me.
[00:41:50.144 --> 00:41:52.726]  You know, when I'm on the radio slash TV, doing my weekday shows,
[00:41:54.934 --> 00:42:08.767]  I've got a crew and they're running it and they don't tell me what to say or do but a couple times a day they said, hey you just set a date wrong or you just said something that they know is wrong and then I correct it because I never consciously get something wrong.
[00:42:11.009 --> 00:42:12.390]  The globalists want everything to be ugly.
[00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:16.353]  The CIA admits that to demoralize you but no, the world's beautiful.
[00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:18.110]  Our minds are beautiful.
[00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:20.071]  Our potential is incredible.
[00:42:20.611 --> 00:42:26.472]  So for myself and the InfoWars family, to all the InfoWarriors, we love you on this Christmas Eve.
[00:42:26.492 --> 00:42:32.774]  The whole universe is a wonderland of free will and consciousness.
[00:42:33.854 --> 00:42:40.956]  So, for myself and the whole crew and my family, we love you InfoWarriors, and we care about you, and we're thinking about you tonight.
[00:42:41.176 --> 00:42:44.857]  And we're fighting hard for all our future destinies together.

[00:45:59.454 --> 00:46:04.758]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[00:46:05.218 --> 00:46:09.581]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[00:46:10.041 --> 00:46:12.503]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[00:46:13.063 --> 00:46:22.450]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.

[00:47:13.823 --> 00:47:14.343]  Hey!
[00:47:15.825 --> 00:47:19.328]  We didn't have a nuclear war yet.
[00:47:19.348 --> 00:47:20.949]  2023 is still here.
[00:47:20.969 --> 00:47:25.292]  Hopefully we don't kill ourselves in 2024.
[00:47:25.392 --> 00:47:25.993]  Let it snow.
[00:47:26.413 --> 00:47:30.617]  Let it snow, let it snow.
[00:47:30.637 --> 00:47:31.758]  Woo!
[00:47:32.318 --> 00:47:34.200]  What an adventure to be alive with all of you.
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:34.960]  What a blessing.
[00:47:35.561 --> 00:47:36.481]  I am so honored to be here.
[00:47:37.162 --> 00:47:39.464]  Alright, let's go back to this Elon Musk
[00:47:40.839 --> 00:47:44.220]  Space is on X. This is the future of things.
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.041]  They're going to bring videos soon.
[00:47:46.081 --> 00:47:47.682]  You'll have like dozens of people on video.
[00:47:48.262 --> 00:47:49.682]  People calling in via video.
[00:47:50.042 --> 00:47:50.923]  This is the future.
[00:47:51.703 --> 00:47:53.224]  Dinosaur Media is dead a long time ago.
[00:47:53.264 --> 00:47:56.385]  They're just zombies funded by the globalists, but they know they're dead.
[00:47:56.425 --> 00:47:57.365]  They know they're a joke.
[00:47:57.725 --> 00:47:59.226]  That's why they want to overturn the whole
[00:48:00.129 --> 00:48:08.577]  System try to maintain control, but that's not gonna work because humanity wants freedom, wants justice, wants a relationship with God, wants a family, wants prosperity.
[00:48:08.977 --> 00:48:11.300]  So back to Elon Musk and X's.
[00:48:12.293 --> 00:48:12.493]  Spaces.
[00:48:12.513 --> 00:48:16.657]  When you're talking three, four hours a day, you make mistakes.
[00:48:17.257 --> 00:48:19.319]  And so I think that that's what this is all about.
[00:48:19.479 --> 00:48:21.000]  And so I really look forward.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.743]  In fact, you know, I want people that politically disagree with me to come on.
[00:48:25.264 --> 00:48:27.665]  That's much better radio and TV.
[00:48:28.626 --> 00:48:33.530]  But, you know, the Internet put people in their own silos where we don't communicate with each other.
[00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:39.875]  And half the time we're disagreeing with the other side because we have a distorted perspective of what they're saying.
[00:48:39.915 --> 00:48:40.416]  And we know.
[00:48:41.076 --> 00:48:54.027]  That the CIA and the Justice Department and the Carnegie and Ford and Rockefeller foundations that on record create all this division, they're the ones that are manipulating all of that and using that for divide and conquer strategies.
[00:48:54.707 --> 00:49:02.954]  And so I do know how community notes work, and I think it's the best system out there, and I think it's a great innovation that's been brought to the internet by action.
[00:49:05.038 --> 00:49:06.619]  One final question, if you don't mind.
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:13.404]  Have you communicated with Musk at all before you were reinstated?
[00:49:13.484 --> 00:49:15.345]  Or did this happen kind of suddenly?
[00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:17.947]  No, I haven't communicated with Elon.
[00:49:18.908 --> 00:49:20.209]  I'm good friends with Joe Rogan.
[00:49:21.269 --> 00:49:26.593]  He didn't tell me any secrets, but we get dinner here and there, and he hangs out with Musk quite a bit.
[00:49:27.153 --> 00:49:31.837]  He told me like two or three years ago, he goes, no, Musk is totally for real and really is pissed off about what's going on.
[00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:39.514]  And Joe basically said, he says a lot of the same stuff you say, you know, to me at dinner, he says at dinner.
[00:49:40.775 --> 00:49:46.340]  And so, I mean, I really have just been really pleased at what Musk has done.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.542]  Christ said, you judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:49:48.862 --> 00:49:52.705]  And the fruit coming out of Musk is just all good.
[00:49:52.805 --> 00:49:57.729]  I mean, it's really amazing what he's been able to do.
[00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:02.974]  And so, and I've told my own listeners this because
[00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:07.553]  Musk has pushed some things, you know, that people can take and say, oh, that's bad.
[00:50:07.613 --> 00:50:16.581]  Well, my uncle was on a motorcycle accident and got an experimental brain chip five years ago and now can walk and talk and everything else.
[00:50:16.601 --> 00:50:19.764]  So I'm not against brain chips when you need them.
[00:50:20.144 --> 00:50:22.006]  I don't think Musk is bad for pushing that.
[00:50:22.046 --> 00:50:28.592]  I don't think school kids should get them or they should be, you know, sold at a consumer level and people should be told, go out and get them if something isn't wrong with you.
[00:50:29.093 --> 00:50:30.174]  But I'm also a libertarian.
[00:50:30.214 --> 00:50:31.896]  If you want to go out and get a brain chip, that's fine.
[00:50:32.417 --> 00:50:35.360]  But my audience, you know, in the last few years, like, well, maybe he is good.
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:41.388]  And then now they're like, wow, this guy's great, because he's doing so much good, you really can't argue with the product.
[00:50:42.489 --> 00:50:44.131]  And that's why the establishment's after him.
[00:50:44.151 --> 00:50:46.373]  And that's the final thing you know somebody's good.
[00:50:47.302 --> 00:50:50.565]  Uh, when the, when the very corrupt evil establishment is after him.
[00:50:50.605 --> 00:51:04.357]  So, I mean, I mean, I wouldn't call myself a muscophile, uh, but I'm certainly a supporter of his main agendas, uh, that I see as very, very healthy and transformative and empowering for the species.
[00:51:05.771 --> 00:51:10.533]  Yeah, and Musk said it himself in a reply to you, Brian.
[00:51:10.553 --> 00:51:12.414]  I'm just trying to find the quote here.
[00:51:12.594 --> 00:51:20.097]  But essentially, I might, if there's something along the lines of, I might disagree with a lot of what Alex says, but this is what free speech is all about.
[00:51:21.338 --> 00:51:24.940]  And also another thing you mentioned, Alex, about Musk's safety.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:31.803]  One of the first things he, I think it was the first time he came on this show or the second, one of the first two, he said something along the lines of,
[00:51:32.984 --> 00:51:37.725]  If they say something happens to me, just remember, I will never commit suicide.
[00:51:38.445 --> 00:51:45.006]  And so it just kind of highlights the concern that many have, just based on a lot of the decisions that he's making, and this is one of them.
[00:51:45.726 --> 00:51:47.247]  Trump will never commit suicide.
[00:51:47.267 --> 00:51:48.547]  I will never commit suicide.
[00:51:48.607 --> 00:51:50.107]  Elon Musk will never commit suicide.
[00:51:50.167 --> 00:51:51.528]  Andrew Tate will never commit suicide.
[00:51:51.588 --> 00:51:52.608]  None of us will ever commit suicide.
[00:51:52.668 --> 00:51:54.008]  Jack Mussovich won't commit suicide.
[00:51:54.028 --> 00:51:55.928]  Steve Bannon won't.
[00:51:56.209 --> 00:51:57.429]  They don't want to turn us into martyrs.
[00:51:57.469 --> 00:51:58.389]  They either poison you,
[00:51:59.196 --> 00:52:01.857]  Or they come to a murder-suicide, kill your wife, kill you.
[00:52:01.917 --> 00:52:03.978]  That's a known deep state tactic.
[00:52:04.539 --> 00:52:09.281]  And so absolutely, if they gun down Elon Musk, that only makes him bigger.
[00:52:10.201 --> 00:52:15.364]  But he's such a threat, they might do it even though it makes him into a martyr, because they know there's not leadership to replace him.
[00:52:16.364 --> 00:52:20.246]  So absolutely, it's very important he get it on record that he will never commit suicide.
[00:52:20.687 --> 00:52:21.387]  That's why Trump
[00:52:22.361 --> 00:52:23.282]  We're good to go.
[00:52:40.211 --> 00:52:44.833]  The kind of stuff they were doing to Trump early on, and I first broke this and later it came out that he thought this too.
[00:52:45.233 --> 00:52:46.294]  They said, oh, Trump's crazy.
[00:52:46.814 --> 00:52:50.436]  He thinks they're putting, you know, sedatives in his food.
[00:52:51.096 --> 00:52:55.978]  Early on in the White House, I've been told by high level sources that he did indeed believe that was happening.
[00:52:56.359 --> 00:52:59.120]  So they also might not kill Musk.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:11.551]  But he should watch out for them, you know, putting radioactive isotope in his food or or some type of, you know, some type of tranquilizer that builds up in the blood.
[00:53:11.571 --> 00:53:17.557]  I mean, this is the real stuff that these intelligence agencies that think they own us have done around the world.
[00:53:17.617 --> 00:53:18.718]  So people better watch out.
[00:53:20.119 --> 00:53:21.120]  And you're talking about one of the
[00:53:21.869 --> 00:53:24.491]  One of the most powerful people in the world and the richest man alive.
[00:53:24.951 --> 00:53:28.334]  So, kind of highlighting that the amount of influence of power they may have.
[00:53:28.974 --> 00:53:37.440]  Talking about the intelligence agencies, you did talk and we do have Jackson on stage, he's been very vocal about the war and Laura as well who's been vocal about the war in Gaza.
[00:53:38.081 --> 00:53:47.208]  You said something on the Tucker Carlson interview, you said, there is no way one of the best intelligence agencies in the world didn't know this was coming and you're referring to what happened on October 7th.
[00:53:48.115 --> 00:53:53.820]  Can you elaborate on this and expand on what that means to the Middle East and how the war could end?
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.181]  I want to be 100% clear.
[00:53:55.341 --> 00:53:57.062]  Israel is a diverse political group.
[00:53:57.523 --> 00:53:59.464]  They were basically in a soft civil war.
[00:53:59.825 --> 00:54:06.350]  So when I criticize Israel, it's not me trying to get points against Israel or points against Palestine or the Palestinians.
[00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:07.050]  It's just a fact.
[00:54:07.631 --> 00:54:11.154]  I did that Tucker interview before the New York Times came out.
[00:54:11.846 --> 00:54:11.926]  Yeah.
[00:54:29.341 --> 00:54:33.425]  Stand down with attack helicopters 10 minutes away by air.
[00:54:34.125 --> 00:54:40.431]  Israel has over 300 of them, including almost 100 Apaches and Cobras, fully loaded with weapons at any one time.
[00:54:40.971 --> 00:54:49.038]  Five attack helicopters could have been there when the first calls came in, but instead retired military officers from as far away as Tel Aviv North
[00:54:49.608 --> 00:54:50.068]  We're good to go.
[00:55:15.552 --> 00:55:15.752]  I think?
[00:55:35.123 --> 00:55:37.805]  Well, what we know for a fact is Israel stood down.
[00:55:38.265 --> 00:55:40.106]  We just don't know exactly who or why.
[00:55:40.446 --> 00:55:40.806]  Jackson?
[00:55:41.267 --> 00:55:42.787]  Yeah, I have a question for Alex.
[00:55:42.847 --> 00:55:45.729]  And Alex, by the way, it was great being on your show about two weeks ago.
[00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:47.890]  I had a fantastic conversation with you.
[00:55:50.296 --> 00:56:07.369]  My question for you is, you know, we look at the Trump administration that's probably going to be forming and the first Trump administration he, you know, handpicked or, you know, they kind of had the Republican Party put a bunch of people in that were deep state appointees that were very pro-war.
[00:56:07.709 --> 00:56:13.634]  It wasn't until the end of the administration when we saw more rational minds like Colonel Douglas McGregor begin to rise up.
[00:56:14.495 --> 00:56:16.876]  So in this next Trump administration,
[00:56:17.857 --> 00:56:31.008]  Obviously, I think he's going to be filling the important spots with those anti-war voices, given everything that's happening with China, Russia, Gaza, and all the people that want to go to war right now so much with those countries.
[00:56:33.493 --> 00:56:37.136]  You know, Trump is only going to be in office for four years and then who's next?
[00:56:37.156 --> 00:56:42.519]  You're going to have another pro-war spokesperson like Ron DeSantis probably running and Gavin Newsom.
[00:56:42.559 --> 00:56:49.064]  So what's the answer to how we can actually rid these anti-human Malthusian scum from our government?
[00:56:49.784 --> 00:56:51.446]  Does Trump have to lock them in prison?
[00:56:51.486 --> 00:56:56.609]  I mean, I personally would support that, but how do you think we actually rid this problem once and for all?
[00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:01.953]  Well, I don't know if Jack Posobiec is there, but he is.
[00:57:02.822 --> 00:57:07.485]  He and Steve Bannon are probably the smartest people on this subject, so if he's still there, please pop that ad for me.
[00:57:07.525 --> 00:57:09.786]  But let me just give you a 35,000-foot view.
[00:57:10.286 --> 00:57:14.829]  What you said is totally true about Trump thought, hey, this is like a business.
[00:57:14.909 --> 00:57:16.350]  I'm going to come in, bring people in.
[00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:17.590]  They're going to do what I tell them.
[00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.850]  No.
[00:57:18.271 --> 00:57:29.577]  Obama signed the Countering Foreign Disinformation Propaganda Act as one of his last acts when he left office in 2017, and he put a stay-behind networks in the agencies
[00:57:30.774 --> 00:57:38.660]  State Department, FBI, CIHS department, some think tanks to actually undermine Trump under the auspices of him being a Russian agent with no proof.
[00:57:39.281 --> 00:57:42.603]  So this was going on at the RNC in 2016.
[00:57:42.643 --> 00:57:46.246]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:57:49.687 --> 00:57:53.409]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:57:53.729 --> 00:57:56.891]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:57:57.291 --> 00:58:01.774]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:58:02.394 --> 00:58:04.516]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:58:04.836 --> 00:58:12.821]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[00:58:13.441 --> 00:58:14.762]  This is the Great Awakening.
[00:58:15.262 --> 00:58:19.167]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:58:19.647 --> 00:58:23.171]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[00:58:23.431 --> 00:58:25.974]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[00:59:52.767 --> 00:59:56.708]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:59.622 --> 01:00:03.967]  The stated mission of modern science is to dominate and control nature.
[01:00:04.408 --> 01:00:17.123]  It was born of the philosophies of Francis Bacon, who suggested we could learn to command nature in action, and of Rene Descartes, who wrote that mankind could become the masters and possessors of nature.
[01:00:17.623 --> 01:00:26.871]  This was science flipped on its head because the previous scientific philosophy saw nature as a perfect creation of God to be observed and understood.
[01:00:27.251 --> 01:00:28.732]  Take, for instance, water.
[01:00:29.072 --> 01:00:31.334]  Without water, we would not exist.
[01:00:31.875 --> 01:00:37.979]  And so the true value is in understanding the nature of water so that we can flow with it, not control it.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:52.407]  For over 20 years, Japanese scientist Dr. Masaru Emoto studied the groundbreaking science of how the molecular structure in water transforms when exposed to human words, thoughts, and sounds.
[01:00:53.107 --> 01:01:01.412]  Dr. Emoto would simply label a sample of water with different written words, such as, love and gratitude, or, I hate you.
[01:01:02.032 --> 01:01:08.718]  He would then freeze the water samples and capture them as they crystallized with high-speed microscopic photography.
[01:01:09.159 --> 01:01:10.860]  The results were astonishing.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:18.707]  The crystals formed from water exposed to the words love and gratitude were clear, attractive, and symmetrical.
[01:01:19.047 --> 01:01:24.452]  And the crystals formed from I hate you were distorted, asymmetrical, and opaque.
[01:01:25.433 --> 01:01:36.017]  Over and over again, water samples exposed to positive intention formed the hexagonal snowflake-like patterns indicative of structured water found in nature.
[01:01:36.537 --> 01:01:44.680]  And samples exposed to negative intention would lose its structure and mutate, which was also found to be true with samples of polluted water.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:53.943]  Decades of repeated experiments have clearly shown that water is transformed when exposed to human word, thought, and sound.
[01:01:54.543 --> 01:01:58.704]  Dr. Emoto theorized that this is because water has consciousness.
[01:01:59.344 --> 01:02:09.327]  Russian studies have shown that water is imprinted by the energy of its environment, and it retains memory from everything it comes in contact with, even when separated.
[01:02:10.546 --> 01:02:22.672]  During the discovery of the genome, Dr. Bruce Lipton was studying cellular behavior at Stanford University and discovered that our genes switch on or off based on their environment.
[01:02:23.112 --> 01:02:33.337]  Human beings are made of about 50 trillion cells, and each cell is its own little creature that eats, digests, reproduces, and forms communities.
[01:02:33.798 --> 01:02:40.101]  Each individual cell is constantly reading the quality of its environment through its outer membrane skin.
[01:02:40.621 --> 01:02:45.082]  This includes stressful emotions sensed via chemicals in the bloodstream.
[01:02:45.443 --> 01:02:51.685]  And when we are stressed, negative, or fearful, then our cells will switch into their own version of fight-or-flight mode.
[01:02:52.105 --> 01:02:56.926]  They will stop the process of self-healing and begin the process of self-defense.
[01:02:57.406 --> 01:03:04.669]  And conversely, when we are feeling positive emotions, our cells will be switched into self-healing, and the body will thrive.
[01:03:05.609 --> 01:03:12.513]  Dr. Lipton's discoveries were ignored by modern science, who opted for drugs and surgery over love and happiness.
[01:03:13.073 --> 01:03:18.296]  This began the field of epigenetics and answered the question of nature versus nurture.
[01:03:18.736 --> 01:03:23.719]  Experiments have shown that a living creature will thrive on a genetic level when nurtured.
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:31.864]  Malignant tumor cells have been reversed, and many people claim to have cured themselves of all sorts of disease, including cancer.
[01:03:32.384 --> 01:03:36.125]  By shifting and maintaining their mental attitude into a positive one.
[01:03:36.685 --> 01:03:42.406]  Official science will predictably call this spontaneous remission, but it is well documented.
[01:03:43.026 --> 01:03:50.208]  The cell protects itself by its membrane, which has a coating of negatively charged sugar crystals in a suspension of water.
[01:03:50.628 --> 01:03:58.290]  Most people think of water as being very special because of its ease of existence in three different states, liquid, ice, and vapor.
[01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:01.811]  But the water in our body is not in any of these states.
[01:04:02.151 --> 01:04:05.052]  The water that makes up our cells is in the gel state.
[01:04:05.513 --> 01:04:11.615]  Science is now recognizing a fourth state of water, known as the gel state, or structured water.
[01:04:11.955 --> 01:04:24.860]  This fourth state is an electropolar state, whereas some of the water becomes a negatively charged gel, and the rest, known as bulk water, maintains a positive charge and remains more like a liquid.
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:29.201]  This electropropulsion creates movement and kinetic energy.
[01:04:29.642 --> 01:04:31.902]  This is how the blood is moved throughout our body.
[01:04:32.243 --> 01:04:37.024]  The latest evidence shows that the blood is pumping the heart, not the other way around.
[01:04:37.444 --> 01:04:40.625]  And it's the gel-state water that propels the blood.
[01:04:41.046 --> 01:04:49.929]  To thrive, this natural propulsion system requires a connection to the earth, sunlight, positive human connection, and peace of mind.
[01:04:50.689 --> 01:04:56.672]  Your body is made up of over 50 trillion cells, and each one's health is dependent upon your own.
[01:04:57.152 --> 01:05:04.335]  Our happiness... I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:05:04.355 --> 01:05:05.916]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:05:06.676 --> 01:05:09.718]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:05:10.598 --> 01:05:14.520]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:18.682]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:05:19.523 --> 01:05:25.490]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[01:05:26.411 --> 01:05:27.312]  It's really just incredible.
[01:05:28.337 --> 01:05:31.220]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:36.986]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:40.751]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:05:40.811 --> 01:05:49.040]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:53.403]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at m4store.com.
[01:05:54.023 --> 01:05:58.647]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to m4store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:05:58.987 --> 01:05:59.828]  Please take action now.
[01:06:06.332 --> 01:06:12.257]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:28.422 --> 01:06:29.002]  We're good.
[01:06:51.218 --> 01:06:52.359]  Prosecute his political enemies.
[01:06:52.819 --> 01:06:54.159]  They're the ones that have been doing that.
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:07:03.404]  All he's got to do is remove them, and he's been provided with lists now, and is now listening to people that knows who's who.
[01:07:03.444 --> 01:07:06.005]  I mean, let me tell you, the deep state really came after me.
[01:07:07.713 --> 01:07:13.116]  In 2018, when I went on air and said, Fiona Hill is on the board of George Soros' Open Society.
[01:07:13.436 --> 01:07:16.678]  Fiona Hill is one of the top writers at theglobalist.com.
[01:07:17.238 --> 01:07:22.141]  Fiona Hill, working with McMaster, are inside operatives, and they're the molds.
[01:07:22.901 --> 01:07:25.983]  And man, I mean, all hell broke loose.
[01:07:26.483 --> 01:07:29.185]  And she went on 60 Minutes and said, I don't even know what a globalist is.
[01:07:30.436 --> 01:07:33.580]  And so that's why they've said they're not going to let Trump get in.
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:40.829]  So they said he was a Russian to the intelligence agencies and the intelligence agencies created the fake dossiers, used cutouts.
[01:07:41.987 --> 01:07:44.748]  Uh, now they're saying he's going to be a dictator.
[01:07:45.089 --> 01:07:46.329]  And so he's got to be stopped.
[01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:50.531]  And I believe like they did with JFK, because he wasn't going along with the federal reserve.
[01:07:50.971 --> 01:07:53.453]  They are already have the plans and blueprints ready.
[01:07:54.113 --> 01:07:56.014]  I guarantee you they're trying to poison him right now.
[01:07:56.634 --> 01:07:59.375]  And, and if that doesn't work, they'll either blow his airplane up or shoot him.
[01:07:59.816 --> 01:08:01.897]  So you're kind of counting your chickens before they're hatched.
[01:08:01.917 --> 01:08:08.660]  And I hope you're right that he gets in, but I don't think they're going to let him get in unless there's a big enough uproar up front.
[01:08:09.355 --> 01:08:12.457]  Uh, to let the establishment know that we're watching them and are aware.
[01:08:12.758 --> 01:08:16.640]  And there may be such an awakening now, uh, that they do back off.
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:21.804]  That would be their smarter course than try to re-infiltrate, uh, in the future.
[01:08:21.844 --> 01:08:22.925]  But I don't believe they're going to do that.
[01:08:22.945 --> 01:08:25.507]  I believe this is the critical juncture, the heart of the battle.
[01:08:25.567 --> 01:08:26.507]  It's the Waterloo.
[01:08:27.308 --> 01:08:31.271]  And they're outnumbered, they're surrounded, uh, and they're not going to surrender.
[01:08:31.451 --> 01:08:38.676]  And, and, and, and so, uh, if, if, if, you know, if Napoleon could have assassinated his enemies instead of being defeated, he would have done that.
[01:08:39.236 --> 01:08:40.877]  And so I use the Napoleon analogy.
[01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:44.019]  So it's the globalists in the bunker like Hitler in 1945.
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:47.782]  The problem is they're still in control of the bureaucracy.
[01:08:48.182 --> 01:08:49.723]  So we are waking everybody up.
[01:08:50.024 --> 01:08:52.846]  Populists are being elected everywhere, all over the world.
[01:08:53.226 --> 01:08:54.367]  The globalists are in trouble.
[01:08:54.767 --> 01:08:58.389]  So now they're going to throw everything, including the kitchen sink at us.
[01:08:58.890 --> 01:09:00.030]  And so that's where I stand on that.
[01:09:00.091 --> 01:09:00.631]  Is Jack still there?
[01:09:01.252 --> 01:09:01.772]  He is, he is.
[01:09:01.873 --> 01:09:03.554]  And we also have Elon on here.
[01:09:04.074 --> 01:09:11.320]  He did say that connections to your account, the reason you couldn't join is it would take a few more hours for all the connections to be restored.
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.721]  But you were thanking Elon earlier.
[01:09:13.781 --> 01:09:18.645]  He's on stage, Alex, for you to thank him and ask him any questions you have or vice versa.
[01:09:18.885 --> 01:09:19.866]  Elon, how are you?
[01:09:20.266 --> 01:09:21.507]  Good, Mario.
[01:09:22.168 --> 01:09:24.670]  Yeah.
[01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:27.091]  It's been quite a... These are tumultuous times.
[01:09:28.773 --> 01:09:29.513]  Wild times, indeed.
[01:09:31.064 --> 01:09:44.152]  Yeah, as you just mentioned, when there's an account with a large number of followers that is restored to the system, there are a lot of connections that need to get—you have to re-knit the thing together, so that takes several hours.
[01:09:44.772 --> 01:09:50.915]  So Alex's account should be working, I think, probably in a few hours.
[01:09:52.196 --> 01:09:56.177]  The rule that we're trying to follow here is to obey the law.
[01:09:56.978 --> 01:10:13.843]  So obey the laws of the United States, obey the laws of the countries in which X is present, and really do our best to not go beyond the law, on the premise that if the people wish the law to be different, then the people will ask their
[01:10:14.423 --> 01:10:14.683]  Thank you.
[01:10:36.173 --> 01:10:39.394]  If the laws change, of course, then we will adjust our behavior accordingly.
[01:10:41.074 --> 01:10:44.855]  So that's sort of the general approach that we're taking.
[01:10:44.875 --> 01:10:55.317]  And now that we have community notes, which, while it's not perfect, I think it's the best fact-checking that I've seen on the Internet.
[01:10:56.157 --> 01:11:01.858]  And so if someone were to post false information, they can be community noted.
[01:11:03.710 --> 01:11:07.992]  And, you know, it's always important to say, like, no fact-checking system is perfect.
[01:11:08.492 --> 01:11:13.475]  If perfection is the standard, you can just basically dispense with all fact-checking because nothing will be perfect.
[01:11:13.895 --> 01:11:19.698]  But really, how good is the batting average of any fact-checking system?
[01:11:19.918 --> 01:11:27.082]  My observation of community notes is that the batting average, the probability that the note is correct, is very high.
[01:11:29.003 --> 01:11:30.804]  Much better than anything else that I've seen on the Internet.
[01:11:31.864 --> 01:11:35.226]  And everything in Community Notes, the code, the data, everything is open source.
[01:11:35.707 --> 01:11:40.590]  So you can independently recreate the outcome of any note as a third party.
[01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:42.291]  So it's full transparency.
[01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:54.599]  So I think that having the Community Notes capability is a very powerful, it's the most powerful disinformation weapon that I'm, you know, for actually combating disinformation.
[01:11:54.619 --> 01:11:55.440]  I mean, I agree.
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.881]  Yeah.
[01:11:56.901 --> 01:11:58.201]  Can I throw something in real quick, Eric?
[01:11:58.662 --> 01:11:58.822]  Sure.
[01:12:00.313 --> 01:12:06.978]  Look, this is why I believe what people were saying and actually questioned and for a little while thought it might not have happened.
[01:12:07.418 --> 01:12:09.200]  We were lied to about WMDs in Iraq.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.861]  We were lied to about anthrax in Iraq.
[01:12:11.241 --> 01:12:12.402]  There was Operation Northwoods.
[01:12:12.422 --> 01:12:12.943]  That was true.
[01:12:14.424 --> 01:12:16.225]  There was Operation Northwoods in 2000.
[01:12:17.106 --> 01:12:18.587]  ABC News declassified.
[01:12:19.588 --> 01:12:19.708]  U.S.
[01:12:19.748 --> 01:12:26.973]  government plan to stage fake mass shootings and blowing up airlines with people that would take off and would land, CIA,
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:34.485]  And then they would actually just blow up a drone plane and then claim a mass event happened or claim a mass fake shooting happened.
[01:12:34.505 --> 01:12:37.687]  So Jesse Smollett lied about what he did.
[01:12:37.707 --> 01:12:44.093]  Hezbollah and Hamas, Hezbollah ran it, did kill a lot of Israelis, condemned the attack.
[01:12:44.133 --> 01:12:49.177]  But it wasn't true that they cut a bunch of kids heads off.
[01:12:50.077 --> 01:12:50.217]  Yeah.
[01:13:08.556 --> 01:13:12.900]  The earth's flat, they have a right to, and the community knows everybody else should challenge them.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:20.185]  But it's the establishment lying so much that makes people not believe anything, and then they lose faith in everything.
[01:13:20.246 --> 01:13:28.332]  I'm actually worried about this, because a lot of my audience is so disillusioned, they think I'm an agent or something, too.
[01:13:28.432 --> 01:13:28.852]  I'm not.
[01:13:31.154 --> 01:13:38.060]  I don't know how we handle this, but I think the government and the media and the think tanks and the PR firms, the propaganda firms, as Elon rightfully said,
[01:13:38.743 --> 01:13:48.991]  have been lying professionally so much they poisoned the well where no one knows what to believe they've created a smoke screen and so I don't know how we deal with that other than getting the community.
[01:13:50.011 --> 01:13:54.034]  Alex, I just want to be clear like you know Hamas does have a habit of cutting off heads.
[01:13:55.035 --> 01:13:58.438]  They're quite proud of cutting off heads.
[01:13:59.579 --> 01:14:04.662]  This particular circumstance perhaps there is some uncertainty but they do
[01:14:05.803 --> 01:14:06.604]  Cut off a lot of heads.
[01:14:07.185 --> 01:14:08.546]  There's no question about that.
[01:14:08.706 --> 01:14:12.029]  They appear to be quite jubilant.
[01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:14.352]  They're quite happy when they cut these heads off.
[01:14:15.272 --> 01:14:16.173]  I don't like Hamas.
[01:14:16.714 --> 01:14:18.075]  I don't like the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:14:18.095 --> 01:14:19.497]  I don't like Hezbollah.
[01:14:19.517 --> 01:14:19.857]  You're right.
[01:14:19.917 --> 01:14:20.758]  That is a hallmark.
[01:14:22.683 --> 01:14:26.628]  They're proud of cutting off heads is my observation.
[01:14:27.328 --> 01:14:27.749]  I agree.
[01:14:27.769 --> 01:14:31.973]  Yosemite Sands, his hallmark is shooting his guns in a red beard and he's short.
[01:14:32.494 --> 01:14:35.377]  Hamas's calling card is cutting off heads.
[01:14:35.477 --> 01:14:36.338]  I totally agree.
[01:14:36.358 --> 01:14:36.979]  They do that a lot.
[01:14:38.888 --> 01:14:39.308]  You're right.
[01:14:39.828 --> 01:14:40.848]  Yeah.
[01:14:40.908 --> 01:14:43.249]  Elon, do you mind if I jump in for a second?
[01:14:43.329 --> 01:14:54.911]  You know, share one thought in response to Ed's question, which is I think there's two kinds of ways to worry if you're worried about the spread of misinformation or false facts.
[01:14:55.631 --> 01:14:58.252]  One is let's deal with the content of the speech itself.
[01:14:58.372 --> 01:15:04.553]  And Elon talked about community notes as being imperfect, though it is maybe the best method out there on the Internet.
[01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:07.454]  And I think that that's one set of discussions to have.
[01:15:08.214 --> 01:15:23.223]  That's quite a different thing from what the law certainly looks at as the most draconian First Amendment violation, which is what it calls a prior restraint, which is to previously just restrain a person from speaking, period.
[01:15:24.064 --> 01:15:35.151]  And I think that that is, no matter what the content of the speech is, it's quite a different thing to say that because of who you are, or what you have said in the past, you may not say another thing in the future.
[01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:45.807]  And so I just think that those are two different concepts and I just, for one, just wanted to share my experience of, uh, my Alex Jones experience, if I may.
[01:15:45.827 --> 01:15:47.149]  That is perfectly said!
[01:15:59.676 --> 01:16:11.502]  We are in the middle of a crude and ugly communist revolution, funded by the big banks as a battering ram into a new age digital economy and a total surveillance state.
[01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:19.966]  All branches of government are attacking we the people and they offer us only one option, a meaningless vote in a rigged election.
[01:16:20.846 --> 01:16:31.549]  What we can do is be prepared and you can support the InfoWar by shopping at InfoWarStore.com for products to help you through good times and bad.
[01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:35.110]  And you can share the videos at Band.Video.
[01:16:35.731 --> 01:16:41.032]  Our best hope still is and always has been a mass awakening.
[01:16:41.472 --> 01:16:43.313]  So download the videos and
[01:16:43.553 --> 01:16:47.159]  Share them, upload them, and send them everywhere.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:51.466]  Let the world unite for truth, justice, and 1776 worldwide.
[01:16:59.187 --> 01:17:01.569]  Thanksgiving 2023 is here.
[01:17:02.329 --> 01:17:07.252]  And I'm giving Thanksgiving for all we've done against tyranny and your incredible support together in this fight.
[01:17:07.773 --> 01:17:19.120]  And I'm particularly giving Thanksgiving that X2, our number one product, the only true atomic iodine on the market after a year plus of being sold out, is finally back in stock, ready to ship now.
[01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:23.603]  If you don't know the power of X2 and the iodine conspiracy, you are insane.
[01:17:24.284 --> 01:17:25.345]  Get X2 now.
[01:17:25.405 --> 01:17:26.445]  It could be the last run ever.
[01:17:26.485 --> 01:17:27.246]  We get shut down.

[01:17:51.497 --> 01:17:54.999]  This is the holy grail of supplements and empowering yourself.

[01:19:50.798 --> 01:19:56.021]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:15.341 --> 01:20:24.052]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:24.513 --> 01:20:29.700]  You don't cut somebody's tongue out.
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.481]  Even if I did bad things in the past.
[01:20:51.147 --> 01:20:52.468]  Then they'd be restrained from speaking.
[01:20:52.729 --> 01:20:54.971]  Most people who have been in a position of prominence in the U.S.
[01:20:54.991 --> 01:21:00.016]  federal government would not be allowed to speak again in other forums if that was the standard we were applying.
[01:21:00.436 --> 01:21:00.677]  Right?
[01:21:00.697 --> 01:21:08.965]  I mean, you think about anybody who's been in the CIA or the FBI in a position of saying that the Hunter Biden laptop story was false or COVID didn't start in a lab in China.
[01:21:08.985 --> 01:21:10.406]  So we could go down that whole rabbit hole.
[01:21:11.688 --> 01:21:23.636]  Yeah, as Alex said earlier, and this is not meant to be any kind of attack on George Bush, but George Bush II did say that there were WMDs in Iraq.
[01:21:23.777 --> 01:21:28.420]  He said it not once, but many times.
[01:21:30.702 --> 01:21:33.144]  He did not have sufficient evidence to make that statement.
[01:21:33.204 --> 01:21:40.329]  And a lot more people died as a consequence of that statement than of anything that Alex Jones has incorrectly said.
[01:21:40.769 --> 01:21:48.292]  But Alex, I think one of the things I just wanted to share with people is that I was actually just curious about this guy, Alex Jones.
[01:21:48.392 --> 01:21:50.253]  You know, I'd never met him, but I happened to be in Texas.
[01:21:50.313 --> 01:21:58.376]  I visited the southern border and, you know, I popped in Austin on the way back or somewhere, I forget where we were, and I heard Alex Jones was, that's where he was.
[01:21:58.436 --> 01:22:00.537]  I said, I want to meet this guy that everybody says don't meet.
[01:22:01.157 --> 01:22:09.201]  And so we sat down and I was actually surprised, and we actually aired it on X, or I put out clips of it on X, I can't remember, in like a podcast format.
[01:22:09.841 --> 01:22:12.864]  And so for me, it was just interesting and eye-opening.
[01:22:13.445 --> 01:22:27.180]  And I think it would be interesting and eye-opening for a lot of people as well to sort of know that there are people who have, who would have ever thought, made some mistakes, said some things that were wrong, and said some other things that were dead right that nobody else was saying either.
[01:22:27.981 --> 01:22:32.605]  And the way that we get to the bottom of what's true is actually hearing one another.
[01:22:32.665 --> 01:22:35.727]  And when people say something false, they deserve to be held accountable.
[01:22:35.748 --> 01:22:41.412]  So I think that's a cool thing that, you know, hopefully we're able to have more of that rather than less because of the existence.
[01:22:41.432 --> 01:22:53.082]  I mean, if this platform didn't exist, you know, that avenue of sorting out bad speech through more speech doesn't really exist on the Internet or in our culture.
[01:22:53.162 --> 01:22:56.725]  And so I think that that's, in response to Ed, a good thing, not a bad thing, in my opinion.
[01:22:57.335 --> 01:23:10.129]  Yeah, and actually, to just elaborate on the public relations firms, PR firms, which really should be called propaganda firms, because that's literally, public relations is literally a propaganda word for propaganda.
[01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:13.673]  You can read the history of how public relations was developed.
[01:23:14.274 --> 01:23:14.914]  Edward Bernays!
[01:23:15.715 --> 01:23:16.055]  Correct.
[01:23:16.956 --> 01:23:43.429]  So, the way that PR firms actually corrupt the media is actually in a very significant way, is that journalists are paid very little as journalists, but they can later retire and join a PR firm and make a lot of money on the basis of the articles they've written in the past and their contacts at their publication.
[01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:51.501]  So there is actually a strong monetary incentive, very strong, for corruption of the traditional media.
[01:23:52.230 --> 01:23:57.272]  Elon, Elon, it's so glad you said that because people don't understand that's how these work and I'm just now learning about that.
[01:23:57.672 --> 01:24:10.558]  The PR firms are so powerful, they're full of intelligence agency, former people, so just like a general will sign off on some bad weapons system, then he retires and gets on the major board of the defense contractor for five million a year.
[01:24:11.018 --> 01:24:18.842]  It's a revolving door and so that's why when these big PR firms snap and say jump, the media says how high and you're actually right.
[01:24:19.474 --> 01:24:25.299]  When it comes to fat checking, they're really one of the most nasty, deceptive groups out there.
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.121]  Yeah, they're propaganda firms.
[01:24:28.201 --> 01:24:31.463]  It would just make a lot more sense if you just think PR firm equals propaganda.
[01:24:31.543 --> 01:24:32.704]  PR equals propaganda.
[01:24:33.125 --> 01:24:35.266]  That is literally what it means.
[01:24:36.828 --> 01:24:38.569]  The public group should really understand that
[01:24:39.269 --> 01:24:41.534]  Public relations literally just means propaganda.
[01:24:42.075 --> 01:24:43.477]  PR firm means propaganda.
[01:24:44.058 --> 01:24:51.573]  And the PR firms have very strong control over the traditional media because that's where journalists go to retire and make tons of money.
[01:24:53.529 --> 01:25:02.373]  So, there's a very strong monetary incentive for journalists to do what the PR firms say, because they know that that is where they're going to get rich in the future.
[01:25:02.673 --> 01:25:03.033]  Bingo!
[01:25:03.573 --> 01:25:14.198]  Elon, a question is more for Alex, and me and Alex were discussing it before you jumped on, is the pressure, if any, that you've faced since reinstating, or since you said you'll reinstate Alex.
[01:25:14.598 --> 01:25:16.639]  Now, Alex kind of referred to
[01:25:18.082 --> 01:25:24.403]  Extreme scenarios where your life could be in danger because of what you're doing with X. I know you mentioned it briefly in one of the first spaces we had.
[01:25:24.883 --> 01:25:28.824]  You made a joke about, hey, guys, if something happens to me, I'll never commit suicide.
[01:25:29.564 --> 01:25:32.165]  But how much pressure have you faced in recent months?
[01:25:33.025 --> 01:25:37.305]  Obviously, we've seen the back and forth with a few organizations that are trying to censor others.
[01:25:38.086 --> 01:25:41.106]  And has that increased since you reinstated Alex?
[01:25:42.466 --> 01:25:45.807]  I mean, at this point, reading the sort of
[01:25:46.565 --> 01:25:49.447]  Legacy Media is just depressing.
[01:25:51.948 --> 01:25:59.672]  I accidentally, once in a while, will go see like Google News or whatever or, you know, Yahoo News or whatever, some random thing.
[01:25:59.692 --> 01:26:05.495]  I'm like, this is just... I mean, frankly, the quality of the propaganda isn't even good.
[01:26:05.996 --> 01:26:08.517]  Look, if you're going to do propaganda, at least make it entertaining.
[01:26:09.598 --> 01:26:11.619]  And I find it's dull, boring.
[01:26:13.084 --> 01:26:16.447]  Uh, it's, you know, and it's not even well-written.
[01:26:16.467 --> 01:26:17.909]  Well, that's right.
[01:26:17.929 --> 01:26:20.251]  They'll put out one thing and then they all parrot it.
[01:26:20.351 --> 01:26:22.753]  It's, it's, it's a dog- Yeah, it's like lazy propaganda.
[01:26:22.793 --> 01:26:23.654]  It's like, work harder.
[01:26:24.655 --> 01:26:26.116]  Hey, we've got Andrew Tate here as well.
[01:26:26.196 --> 01:26:26.757]  Andrew, how are you?
[01:26:27.177 --> 01:26:27.738]  I'm good, friend.
[01:26:27.758 --> 01:26:36.746]  I'm in the middle of a poker game, but since this is the battle for humanity against the Satanists and the Matrix with its constant deception of the populace, I thought I would jump in and say hello to everybody.
[01:26:37.509 --> 01:26:42.632]  Your thoughts, Andrew, we had your brother on earlier, Tristan come on earlier.
[01:26:42.672 --> 01:26:45.513]  Your thoughts on Alex Jones being back on X?
[01:26:45.993 --> 01:26:50.676]  I'd rather hear his thoughts on Elon Musk being the biggest maverick of the last 500 years.
[01:26:50.756 --> 01:26:51.716]  I'm not kissing ass here.
[01:26:51.736 --> 01:26:56.058]  Elon, you've got big ones, man, on every front.
[01:26:56.459 --> 01:26:58.720]  You are literally overturning the entire power structure.
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:02.362]  I was just going to say this and let Andrew get in, but I just want to say this while you're here.
[01:27:02.382 --> 01:27:04.683]  I mean, you are literally changing
[01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:21.085]  The entire paradigm, and you've definitely got the system scared, and so everybody needs to support X. Everybody needs to support the sponsors on X. I personally am doing all my Christmas shopping this year with all the great gadgets and stuff that are on X, but I'm going to shut up now.
[01:27:21.105 --> 01:27:25.690]  But I would imagine instead of talking about Alex Jones, I'd like to hear Andrew Tate talk about or ask questions to Elon Musk.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.341]  Yeah, well, Alex is certainly a friend of mine.
[01:27:28.381 --> 01:27:32.243]  I've known him for a long time, and I'm extremely happy he's back.
[01:27:32.283 --> 01:27:34.724]  I've celebrated that publicly, but Alex nailed it.
[01:27:34.824 --> 01:27:36.425]  Elon is taking the biggest risk here.
[01:27:36.945 --> 01:27:39.426]  It takes unlimited energy to propagate lies.
[01:27:39.486 --> 01:27:46.169]  You have to continually repeat them, and you have to continue to try and falsify information and hide the truth to keep lies afloat.
[01:27:46.589 --> 01:27:47.970]  And this simple purchase
[01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:49.251]  You call it simple.
[01:28:08.993 --> 01:28:13.155]  Your ability to speak freely is heavily leveraged against your insignificance.
[01:28:13.195 --> 01:28:15.836]  You're only allowed to speak if nobody listens to you.
[01:28:15.856 --> 01:28:18.958]  And if you get big and people start listening, they're going to come at you hard.
[01:28:18.998 --> 01:28:25.862]  And I think I'm not completely versed, but from what I understand, Elon's already suffering the lawfare tactics, which they're going to do.
[01:28:25.882 --> 01:28:29.183]  They're going to keep pulling out the hat to try and slow him down.
[01:28:29.243 --> 01:28:31.885]  Oh, Andrew, let me interrupt before I forget.
[01:28:31.905 --> 01:28:33.706]  I don't give any attention.
[01:28:33.726 --> 01:28:36.447]  The same law firm that came after me with these PR firms,
[01:28:37.307 --> 01:28:39.449]  There is a three-letter agency running this.
[01:28:40.069 --> 01:28:45.013]  Not all of them, but let's just say it starts with a C and it ends with an A. Sorry, go ahead, Andrew.
[01:28:45.894 --> 01:28:49.737]  Yeah, absolutely, and there's liberal NGOs which will sponsor agents of the Matrix.
[01:28:49.777 --> 01:28:57.243]  They'll sponsor females to end up in a house party and then lie to try and put you in a Romanian jail cell and get you sitting with the cockroaches in a dungeon.
[01:28:58.490 --> 01:29:04.317]  A lot of people have asked me, why is MFW Store and MFW Life not at a probiotic for more than 3 years?
[01:29:04.737 --> 01:29:05.478]  The answer is simple.
[01:29:05.958 --> 01:29:08.461]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[01:29:08.882 --> 01:29:13.006]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than 7 years.
[01:29:13.026 --> 01:29:18.452]  They got bought by a lip tart company and said, we're not doing business with you Mr. Jones anymore.
[01:29:19.193 --> 01:29:24.377]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[01:29:24.677 --> 01:29:28.961]  We're able to private label it under InfoWars MD as our probiotic formula.

[01:30:04.331 --> 01:30:06.113]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[01:30:06.694 --> 01:30:09.938]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[01:30:10.479 --> 01:30:11.360]  The Great Awakening.
[01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:15.286]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[01:30:15.706 --> 01:30:17.348]  This is such a powerful book.
[01:30:17.748 --> 01:30:26.356]  It covers all the globalist plans, the latest developments, how to stop them, and then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[01:30:26.677 --> 01:30:27.838]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[01:30:28.238 --> 01:30:30.360]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.

[01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:06.645]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.525 --> 01:33:30.447]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:30.587 --> 01:33:35.330]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:43.374]  It's a very scary world where you get to a point where you're only trying to tell the truth and they're going to punish you for that using endless lawfare.
[01:33:43.834 --> 01:33:46.276]  And this battle has only just begun.
[01:33:46.696 --> 01:33:52.539]  But the Matrix has truly cracked now and it's going to be extremely hard to lie to us like they did before with X the way it currently is.
[01:33:52.879 --> 01:33:54.980]  And I think it came at exactly the right time.
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:55.521]  I almost
[01:33:56.161 --> 01:33:59.844]  Without trying to sound pessimistic, there was a point where I kind of felt like I was losing hope.
[01:34:00.044 --> 01:34:01.745]  You couldn't tell the truth about anything!
[01:34:02.246 --> 01:34:03.326]  Everything was a lie!
[01:34:03.747 --> 01:34:09.311]  Everything from head to toe was a lie, and they're trying to lock us all back in our houses again, and we can finally talk about it.
[01:34:09.371 --> 01:34:15.435]  It's truly heroic, and Elon's taking massive risk, and the respect I have for him for doing that is enormous.
[01:34:15.956 --> 01:34:16.476]  Absolutely.
[01:34:16.496 --> 01:34:17.297]  I mean, this is what happened.
[01:34:17.317 --> 01:34:20.019]  I'm going to shut up, because I want to hear from Elon, but this is so historic.
[01:34:20.459 --> 01:34:24.462]  Elon Musk's courage, and it's true, I have to say it, has broken the back of the globalists.
[01:34:24.702 --> 01:34:25.243]  They'll never
[01:34:25.783 --> 01:34:27.846]  Well, I guess some people are afraid to die, but I am not.
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:46.863]  They were asking about my seizure, how they took all my houses, all my money, all my cars, blah, blah.
[01:34:47.263 --> 01:34:49.564]  And I said, you never truly own anything on this earth anyway.
[01:34:49.584 --> 01:34:55.588]  You can have a piece of paper that says you own it, but if you piss off the government structures, they just get a judge to stamp a different piece of paper and you no longer own it.
[01:34:55.889 --> 01:34:58.130]  The only thing you own is your soul and your integrity.
[01:34:58.550 --> 01:35:01.833]  And this is the one thing they cannot take away from you, no matter what they do to you.
[01:35:02.273 --> 01:35:03.714]  And that is the best feeling on earth.
[01:35:03.774 --> 01:35:09.538]  It doesn't matter if you can sell your soul to the devil and repeat what they want you to say, but then you truly own nothing.
[01:35:10.143 --> 01:35:20.496]  And I think that as history books look back on this pivotal moment when X was finally freed and the information of the world could finally be spoken freely, I really do believe we're on the right side of history.
[01:35:20.536 --> 01:35:25.543]  And if you were to ask me if there's anything worth dying for, it would be for the freedom of humanity and to be on the right side of history.
[01:35:25.563 --> 01:35:26.804]  So I agree with you absolutely.
[01:35:27.786 --> 01:35:27.946]  Yeah.
[01:35:28.544 --> 01:35:28.944]  Absolutely.
[01:35:29.004 --> 01:35:34.126]  I'm just generally in favor of civilization and the furtherance of civilization.
[01:35:35.306 --> 01:35:41.248]  And I think we should always be concerned that we can regress as a civilization.
[01:35:41.348 --> 01:35:50.831]  And if you study history, you see the arc of one civilization after another as the civilizations rise and fall through history.
[01:35:52.291 --> 01:35:58.053]  We've been in a period of civilization rising very rapidly, but we should be concerned that
[01:35:59.753 --> 01:36:17.837]  We may be cresting, we may subside, and there are many times where I get late-stage civilization vibes, and I'm just worried that maybe we're cresting as a civilization and perhaps headed for a fall.
[01:36:21.539 --> 01:36:33.063]  Well, I agree with you, because I truly believe, and a lot of people have said this before me, this is not an original idea, but I think as AI and machines and tech increases, a lot of people are going to be deemed useless by the overlords.
[01:36:33.123 --> 01:36:41.385]  And then you have to sit and decide, what are they going to do with all these people who have hopes and dreams, and they want healthcare, and they want a garden, and they want a house to live in, and they don't want to be treated like cattle.
[01:36:41.725 --> 01:36:43.346]  They're going to become extremely inconvenient.
[01:36:43.926 --> 01:36:47.067]  So I don't think many people at home understand that this war cannot be avoided.
[01:36:47.107 --> 01:36:51.468]  I've had a lot of people who understand why they threw me in jail in Romania and understood I've done nothing wrong.
[01:36:51.948 --> 01:36:53.828]  And they said to me, why do you take up this fight?
[01:36:53.888 --> 01:36:57.209]  Why you don't just delete your Twitter and disappear and drive a Ferrari all day?
[01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:59.609]  And I explained that this war cannot be avoided.
[01:36:59.629 --> 01:37:03.370]  You're either on the front line and you're fighting for something or you're sitting waiting to die.
[01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:06.331]  You're waiting for the Mongol horde to come over the horizon and chop your head off.
[01:37:06.791 --> 01:37:07.871]  No, I totally agree.
[01:37:08.471 --> 01:37:12.572]  And just to throw this in there, if you read, and Elon,
[01:37:13.348 --> 01:37:14.249]  I knew you were doing great work.
[01:37:14.269 --> 01:37:22.054]  When I saw you six months ago at the World Government Summit, where they're all just saying, we're going to make everybody eat bugs and we'll make the decisions to put microchips in them.
[01:37:22.074 --> 01:37:24.836]  And you said, we don't want a centralized system.
[01:37:25.196 --> 01:37:26.297]  We want a diverse system.
[01:37:26.317 --> 01:37:27.318]  We want firewalls.
[01:37:28.058 --> 01:37:30.880]  And I don't agree with this Tower of Babel you're building.
[01:37:31.381 --> 01:37:37.425]  They know that we go through cycles and they want to artificially create a great reset collapse in their own words.
[01:37:38.331 --> 01:37:44.152]  To make everybody else poor, consolidate power, and they'll have a smaller, Type 2 civilization for themselves.
[01:37:44.772 --> 01:37:51.114]  And I think you're trying to build a Type 2 civilization, or even a Type 1 civilization, I should say, for all of us.
[01:37:51.754 --> 01:37:57.615]  And we need to have a debate about going interstellar.
[01:37:57.655 --> 01:37:59.156]  We've got to expand or we collapse.
[01:37:59.236 --> 01:38:03.377]  And Elon Musk is saying, correct me if I'm wrong, you don't stay in stasis.
[01:38:03.397 --> 01:38:04.757]  You either expand or you collapse.
[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:07.622]  Yes, exactly.
[01:38:07.802 --> 01:38:09.643]  You either grow or you collapse.
[01:38:11.144 --> 01:38:13.585]  The steady state is basically an impossibility.
[01:38:13.966 --> 01:38:16.127]  So you have to make a choice.
[01:38:16.527 --> 01:38:21.350]  Do you want to grow a civilization or do you want to decline and collapse?
[01:38:21.370 --> 01:38:23.832]  Because a steady state is not stable.
[01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:36.233]  And I say we grow, and I say we expand, and we have more humans, and we become a multi-planet species in a space-faring civilization and ultimately be out there among the stars.
[01:38:36.593 --> 01:38:40.596]  And I think that is the exciting, inspiring thing for the future.
[01:38:41.577 --> 01:38:47.341]  Not a declining human civilization that dwindles to nothingness and where humanity dies with a whimper.
[01:38:47.921 --> 01:38:48.982]  And that's the bottom line.
[01:38:49.022 --> 01:38:54.906]  I think it is the battle of people who believe in humans and humanity and want it to expand against people who are so selfishly
[01:38:55.686 --> 01:39:00.469]  Going through the Earth and so selfishly orientated that they don't care about expanding civilization.
[01:39:00.509 --> 01:39:02.590]  They just want to control the humans that are currently here.
[01:39:02.991 --> 01:39:04.391]  And Andrew, I totally agree with you.
[01:39:04.451 --> 01:39:05.132]  And arrogance.
[01:39:05.852 --> 01:39:06.213]  I totally agree.
[01:39:06.233 --> 01:39:11.015]  But let me throw this caveat because I've read the writings of Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and the Club of Rome.
[01:39:11.436 --> 01:39:13.457]  They know we could easily expand.
[01:39:13.477 --> 01:39:16.459]  There's plenty of room, hundreds of millions of galaxies.
[01:39:17.039 --> 01:39:24.384]  They know that this is just a seed that's going to not just grow into one giant oak, but an entire forest, an entire universe.
[01:39:24.964 --> 01:39:31.887]  And so they want to shut everybody else down because they can't build a competition with the Elon Musk that come out of the general public.
[01:39:32.347 --> 01:39:37.309]  They want a global tyranny so they can direct it and control it so that they direct the expansion.
[01:39:37.969 --> 01:39:46.172]  And we can't let that happen because they literally talk about it in Agenda 21, the official UN plan, a 90% world population.
[01:39:46.212 --> 01:39:47.173]  So we need to go
[01:39:47.953 --> 01:39:51.297]  With the Elon Musk plan, and that's why I tell people to get upset.
[01:39:51.337 --> 01:39:54.220]  They go, Elon Musk is involved in every advancing technology.
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:56.082]  The globalists are pushing that too.
[01:39:56.422 --> 01:39:57.844]  Well, technology is like a gun.
[01:39:58.364 --> 01:39:59.846]  It's whose hand it's in.
[01:40:00.266 --> 01:40:05.332]  And so we need the gun in the people's hands, the gun of expansion, instead of in the globalist hands.
[01:40:05.612 --> 01:40:08.315]  And so just because Elon Musk is on the cutting edge of every technology,
[01:40:08.795 --> 01:40:10.878]  Don't fear the technology like some troglodyte.
[01:40:11.198 --> 01:40:12.720]  Fear us not being in control of it.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:24.995]  And Elon is saying we need to be an expansionary human explosion of competition and freedom, not some new dark age with a tiny breakaway civilization that's only working for itself.
[01:40:25.055 --> 01:40:25.696]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[01:40:25.936 --> 01:40:34.699]  No, no, but you're completely right, because if Elon doesn't push these boundaries, they will push these boundaries, and once they have the sole control and the monopoly over such technologies, it's over for all of us.
[01:40:34.739 --> 01:40:35.959]  I don't think most people understand.
[01:40:36.319 --> 01:40:40.961]  It simply is the humanistic view against the death cult view, and there's people in the world who have no interest
[01:40:40.981 --> 01:40:41.221]  Yes, exactly.
[01:40:41.381 --> 01:40:42.962]  They're thinking about it the wrong way.
[01:41:09.855 --> 01:41:15.117]  Sorry, I just got a little X here.
[01:41:15.257 --> 01:41:17.458]  This right, left, it's the wrong way to think about it.
[01:41:17.578 --> 01:41:21.480]  It's sort of the extinctionists versus the pro-humans.
[01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:29.423]  And once you see that it's extinctionists versus the humans, the pro-humans, then it becomes very clear.
[01:41:29.923 --> 01:41:37.006]  So Elon, when are you going to, I know you've got a hundred irons to the fire, but I've really, when you talk about we need to create a plan B for humanity,
[01:41:37.486 --> 01:41:38.146]  No, it's not my plan.
[01:41:38.206 --> 01:41:38.666]  I mean, I think...
[01:41:54.731 --> 01:42:22.317]  No, I mean, what I'm saying is that, actually, I think we should expand humanity, like, basically, we should have more kids, you know, the population should increase, and we should become a multi-planet species, and, you know, make life multi-planetary, build a self-sustaining civilization on Mars, and then ultimately, you know, this will be long after I'm dead, probably, but,
[01:42:23.157 --> 01:42:24.378]  Well, almost certainly.
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:30.624]  We can go to other star systems and go out there and, I don't know, maybe we'll find some long-dead alien civilizations.
[01:42:32.225 --> 01:42:37.710]  And I don't think we want to be one of those lame one-planet civilizations that never got beyond, you know, its own planet.
[01:42:37.730 --> 01:42:43.575]  I mean, we gotta, you know... What are the aliens gonna think of that?
[01:42:44.035 --> 01:42:47.218]  It's like, we gotta make a good showing.
[01:42:47.238 --> 01:42:48.099]  Team Human.
[01:42:58.302 --> 01:43:02.983]  Please do not forget that my book has gone number one on a bunch of the different subcharts.
[01:43:03.463 --> 01:43:06.244]  The Great Awakening Part 2 of The Great Reset, twice as long.

[01:43:58.294 --> 01:44:03.616]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[01:44:04.056 --> 01:44:08.418]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[01:44:08.878 --> 01:44:11.360]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:21.284]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[01:44:21.484 --> 01:44:24.065]  It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.

[01:44:45.782 --> 01:44:48.184]  The amazing medium roast wig of America.
[01:44:48.464 --> 01:44:51.345]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[01:45:02.935 --> 01:45:07.477]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[01:45:08.118 --> 01:45:11.039]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:12.300]  Well, I know where you are.
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:16.602]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.
[01:45:17.103 --> 01:45:22.966]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[01:45:23.726 --> 01:45:30.294]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[01:45:30.714 --> 01:45:33.938]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent and War for the World.
[01:45:34.379 --> 01:45:38.904]  It's a longer book, quite frankly a more powerful book, and just like the last book,
[01:45:39.184 --> 01:45:39.444]  We're good.
[01:45:58.524 --> 01:46:03.967]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[01:46:04.727 --> 01:46:09.009]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[01:46:09.409 --> 01:46:13.811]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at infowarestore.com.
[01:46:15.232 --> 01:46:18.014]  So many people have serious issues.
[01:46:18.274 --> 01:46:19.394]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[01:46:19.834 --> 01:46:25.257]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[01:46:25.797 --> 01:46:31.180]  Most of the other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements, so you don't download it.
[01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:34.582]  But this is pure atomic certified
[01:46:36.477 --> 01:46:37.697]  I don't know.
[01:47:00.655 --> 01:47:04.716]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:05.256 --> 01:47:06.577]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:13.618 --> 01:47:15.179]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:15.219 --> 01:47:17.319]  Because there is a war on.
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:21.221]  For your mind.
[01:47:21.481 --> 01:47:22.401]  Children are bad.
[01:47:22.481 --> 01:47:23.141]  We're ugly.
[01:47:23.241 --> 01:47:25.562]  Humans create all this racial division.
[01:47:25.902 --> 01:47:27.082]  They want us to hate each other.
[01:47:27.122 --> 01:47:27.982]  So we just give up.
[01:47:28.162 --> 01:47:28.602]  Roll over.
[01:47:28.622 --> 01:47:30.363]  So the globalists can have the future.
[01:47:31.149 --> 01:47:37.610]  I would just like to say here... The globalists are short-sighted, too, because the thing is that you can't really separate yourself from civilization.
[01:47:37.630 --> 01:47:44.792]  So I think those who are sort of advocating... I think it's just logical to be pro-civilization.
[01:47:44.812 --> 01:47:47.092]  You don't actually necessarily have to be altruistic.
[01:47:47.472 --> 01:47:52.573]  You just have to think long-term and say, obviously you cannot exist in any good way without civilization.
[01:47:52.933 --> 01:47:57.734]  I mean, just watch one episode of Naked and Afraid and see how much you want to go live in a forest by yourself.
[01:47:58.435 --> 01:47:59.155]  It's not fun.
[01:48:00.871 --> 01:48:06.896]  We're in a super pivotal moment now, and the reason we're in a pivotal moment is because the machines cannot do the policing as of yet.
[01:48:06.956 --> 01:48:11.879]  My brother and I often talk about how bad COVID would have been if they had Terminator machines.
[01:48:11.899 --> 01:48:17.163]  You didn't have your mask on, you couldn't even appeal to the empathy of the person who knew how insane it all was.
[01:48:17.483 --> 01:48:21.647]  As soon as the machines control the policing, it's absolutely over, and we're not that far away.
[01:48:21.947 --> 01:48:28.111]  So we're in a very pivotal period now where the bravery that's required to resist a globalist oppression has to happen now.
[01:48:28.512 --> 01:48:29.913]  Soon the technology will exist.
[01:48:30.413 --> 01:48:31.554]  And it's over for everybody.
[01:48:32.234 --> 01:48:38.757]  We are at a critical crossroads right now in the entire future of the human destiny.
[01:48:38.997 --> 01:48:42.019]  And I called it Plan B, but I mean, Elon, what do you call it?
[01:48:42.039 --> 01:48:43.780]  Just an alternate plan for humanity?
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:49.583]  Because we should have a debate because the Black Rocks and the Globalists are right now in control
[01:48:50.661 --> 01:48:52.101]  They were 100% control.
[01:48:52.121 --> 01:48:53.662]  You and others felt restless.
[01:48:53.702 --> 01:48:55.162]  Maybe they're in 80% control.
[01:48:55.522 --> 01:48:58.362]  They're losing control very quickly as people discover what they're doing.
[01:48:58.422 --> 01:49:03.063]  But what would you call the debate and discussions about a pro-human future?
[01:49:03.083 --> 01:49:03.964]  Just Team Humanity?
[01:49:04.464 --> 01:49:05.364]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[01:49:05.504 --> 01:49:05.924]  Absolutely.
[01:49:06.364 --> 01:49:07.364]  That sounds good.
[01:49:08.104 --> 01:49:15.286]  But I think something that is really important is you just literally have to have kids or there's no next generation.
[01:49:16.106 --> 01:49:17.146]  Alex, do you have kids?
[01:49:18.277 --> 01:49:18.698]  Yes, I do.
[01:49:18.718 --> 01:49:20.700]  I'm not as prolific as you, but I wish I was.
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:21.641]  It's the best thing in my life.
[01:49:21.681 --> 01:49:22.141]  I have four.
[01:49:23.283 --> 01:49:23.723]  Okay, great.
[01:49:24.003 --> 01:49:24.644]  And Andrew?
[01:49:25.505 --> 01:49:26.126]  I do have a few.
[01:49:26.166 --> 01:49:27.167]  I won't let you down, Elon.
[01:49:27.187 --> 01:49:27.608]  I'm coming.
[01:49:27.708 --> 01:49:29.109]  I'm coming to take over your title.
[01:49:29.450 --> 01:49:30.531]  I'm coming to take over.
[01:49:30.871 --> 01:49:31.672]  I'm doing my best.
[01:49:31.772 --> 01:49:34.255]  You know, I use my good looks for something.
[01:49:35.016 --> 01:49:38.680]  Well, I think we ought to encourage people to, you know,
[01:49:39.526 --> 01:49:39.766]  I don't
[01:49:58.081 --> 01:50:00.164]  I have friends who I would consider globalists.
[01:50:00.505 --> 01:50:11.821]  You ask them, their ideologies are aligned that they believe that somebody living across the world is just as valuable as somebody who lives in America.
[01:50:13.663 --> 01:50:25.887]  No, but that's not how everybody who you would categorize as... Globalists at the top are depopulationists.
[01:50:26.547 --> 01:50:30.328]  So maybe if you want to look at the top, you can say globalists at the top.
[01:50:30.468 --> 01:50:34.690]  Some of them might have that view, but you know, if you just talk to an ordinary person who
[01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:36.852]  I would call that an internationalist.
[01:50:36.872 --> 01:50:38.274]  That's an internationalist.
[01:50:38.394 --> 01:50:41.437]  A globalist wants one world government run by corporations.
[01:50:52.771 --> 01:50:58.653]  Yeah, I mean, I think you can label them differently, but I think if you talk to somebody... Henry Kissinger was a globalist.
[01:50:59.073 --> 01:51:00.834]  Zbigniew Brzezinski was a globalist.
[01:51:01.154 --> 01:51:05.576]  I'm not trying to be mean to you, but their number one rule is the Earth is too small.
[01:51:05.976 --> 01:51:06.976]  We can't expand.
[01:51:07.416 --> 01:51:09.697]  We've got to bean count and put everybody on rations.
[01:51:10.037 --> 01:51:12.398]  We've got a social engineer and in the normal human
[01:51:13.119 --> 01:51:22.326]  I'll answer the question.
[01:51:22.346 --> 01:51:24.968]  Some of these titles are a little confusing.
[01:51:25.008 --> 01:51:38.719]  If someone's an internationalist or a globalist, I think what can achieve some disambiguation here is to say, does someone have as an axiomatic belief that there are too many people on the earth, or do they not?
[01:51:39.366 --> 01:51:44.089]  Do they believe that the Earth can sustain the current population, or do they think it cannot?
[01:51:44.489 --> 01:51:51.014]  Now, the reality is Earth can actually handle a human population probably ten times larger than the current population.
[01:51:51.454 --> 01:51:53.936]  Earth is actually very sparsely populated by humans.
[01:51:54.336 --> 01:51:59.840]  We only see density because if we're in a dense urban environment like New York or Boston,
[01:52:00.609 --> 01:52:03.331]  You'd have to drop 10,000 bowling balls maybe.
[01:52:17.341 --> 01:52:17.581]  Yes.
[01:52:17.981 --> 01:52:23.745]  I'll tell you something that may scare people a little bit.
[01:52:24.406 --> 01:52:29.089]  There are thousands of objects falling onto Earth from space all the time.
[01:52:29.929 --> 01:52:34.913]  But how often do you hear about someone actually getting hit by meteorites?
[01:52:35.593 --> 01:52:36.054]  Absolutely.
[01:52:36.074 --> 01:52:39.076]  There's one known case of a woman at her house getting hit by one.
[01:52:39.216 --> 01:52:42.258]  Elon, I want to just respond to Ed actually for a second.
[01:52:42.878 --> 01:52:46.681]  I think it's good to get a good counter view here.
[01:52:47.502 --> 01:52:49.852]  I think that there's two different things going on in it.
[01:52:49.892 --> 01:52:51.318]  I know what you're trying to say.
[01:52:52.267 --> 01:52:55.749]  But there's a separate point about your obligations, right?
[01:52:55.769 --> 01:53:06.016]  So you can, and I believe a lot, everything has been said about the importance of expansionism for humanity being pro-civilization and expansion pro-human race to win.
[01:53:06.476 --> 01:53:12.560]  That's like a separate axis, though, from saying where are your obligations where you are, right?
[01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:14.361]  So we talked about procreation and family.
[01:53:14.381 --> 01:53:15.682]  Then we talked about the nation.
[01:53:16.323 --> 01:53:17.864]  Well, look, I have two kids.
[01:53:18.803 --> 01:53:24.226]  As a father, my moral obligation, I believe, is first and foremost to my family.
[01:53:24.987 --> 01:53:31.050]  And then, let's say, as a president, my moral obligation is to the citizens of the nation that I lead.
[01:53:31.751 --> 01:53:37.775]  And then you can worry about hunger in the Congo or whatever else needs to happen in the Darfur or in other places.
[01:53:38.375 --> 01:53:42.737]  And so I don't think that you're saying, necessarily, that that life... Charity begins at home.
[01:53:42.978 --> 01:53:43.318]  Exactly.
[01:53:43.358 --> 01:53:46.280]  And that's not saying that that life abroad is any less
[01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:47.380]  Thank you.
[01:54:02.694 --> 01:54:04.196]  Where's your obligations?
[01:54:04.696 --> 01:54:06.098]  As a father, it's to your family.
[01:54:06.158 --> 01:54:07.739]  As a president, it's to your country.
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:13.105]  And just because you believe that's the hierarchy of your obligations means somebody else is the leader of one of those other countries.
[01:54:13.586 --> 01:54:17.850]  And that's an obligation that they have too, but that's a different discussion.
[01:54:18.851 --> 01:54:22.115]  The neoliberals in their own PR, they're the ones
[01:54:22.715 --> 01:54:23.295]  Yeah.
[01:54:38.081 --> 01:54:40.002]  Henry Kissinger, State Department memorandum 200.
[01:54:40.242 --> 01:54:42.803]  It's not black and white.
[01:54:43.263 --> 01:54:46.205]  I think it's two different conversations.
[01:54:46.865 --> 01:54:54.728]  What I do believe is black and white is simply if you read a history book you'll see the worst things that humanity have ever done have been done with good intentions.
[01:54:54.768 --> 01:54:58.090]  That's what's so bad about evil acts is that people think they're doing the right thing.
[01:54:58.730 --> 01:55:00.251]  And that's the most dangerous thing about it.
[01:55:00.711 --> 01:55:04.772]  And this idea that they look at all human life as sacred and all the same, I actually disagree.
[01:55:04.812 --> 01:55:09.554]  I think the reason they will prioritize people in a third world country, for example, you'll say it's because they see us as equal.
[01:55:09.934 --> 01:55:12.955]  I think it's because they see us now as spoiled and annoying.
[01:55:13.236 --> 01:55:16.017]  They don't like that we need pensions and living space and healthcare.
[01:55:16.037 --> 01:55:20.658]  They simply want slaves and a robot class and they'll do anything it takes to get it and they'll get it from anywhere they can.
[01:55:21.119 --> 01:55:24.900]  And when someone comes along and says, well, my intentions are good, I'm not interested in that.
[01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:31.443]  Because you can name any holocaust or any atrocity in history, the people didn't think they were the bad guys, they often thought they were the good guys.
[01:55:31.944 --> 01:55:40.308]  And I guess the easy way to look at life is, you want to be having as many children as possible, you want to pray other people do the same, and you want those people to enjoy freedom.
[01:55:42.589 --> 01:55:45.471]  Oh yeah, you don't just get beautiful Christmas music on Christmas Eve.
[01:55:46.711 --> 01:55:49.693]  You get Blue Eyes, Frank Sinatra,
[01:55:50.643 --> 01:55:53.184]  With a little ode to the Democratic Party.
