[00:00:07.415 --> 00:00:14.361]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:18.664]  You better believe you got one!
[00:00:18.664 --> 00:00:23.528]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:48.137 --> 00:00:52.440]  The world conspiracy is in inept hands right now.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.243]  Whereas prior to the first half of the 20th century, it was in very expert hands.
[00:00:58.243 --> 00:00:59.364]  The old guard died off.
[00:00:59.364 --> 00:01:04.027]  You don't have your Cecil Rhodes anymore, and you don't have your Lord Kitcheners anymore, you know?
[00:01:04.027 --> 00:01:09.731]  So the new brats that came in to rule the system in the place of their fathers are fucking cuckoo.
[00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:12.072]  And they're inept at running the machine.
[00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.714]  But the one thing that they still maintain is fear.
[00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:16.669]  Right?
[00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:22.032]  So our modern age is an age of anxiety and also fear because fear is the mind killer.
[00:01:22.032 --> 00:01:29.936]  And so they manufacture all sorts of Dr. Strangelove Frankensteinian stories about the world to come and you just go, well, that's it.
[00:01:29.936 --> 00:01:36.239]  We'll be immobilized out of a band and over my cell phone and they'll know where I am and I won't be able to move and I won't be able to do it.
[00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:38.420]  And all of this is potentially true.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.502]  But there's an equal case for the impossibility of bringing those things to bear.
[00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:59.837]  As much as there is the theory that they can be put in place, anyone who studied the Brotherhood for five minutes properly and sincerely knows that it is through the fear that they generate within me that they not only feed off, but control us all.
[00:01:59.837 --> 00:02:01.278]  It's an invisible enemy.
[00:02:01.278 --> 00:02:09.542]  The other stuff, at least, you know, maybe I can do something about that or move to the country or, you know, so the human race might rise up and might, might, might, might, might.
[00:02:09.542 --> 00:02:13.164]  But while I'm waiting for that, I'm drowning in psychological terror.
[00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.214]  That is the control mechanism.
[00:02:17.214 --> 00:02:19.858]  That is the control mechanism.
[00:02:19.858 --> 00:02:21.040]  The fear is the mind killer.
[00:02:21.932 --> 00:02:27.997]  The main character in Frank Herbert's Dune uses a mantra to overcome his fears.
[00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:29.679]  Fear is the mind killer.
[00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:33.202]  Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.
[00:02:33.202 --> 00:02:34.784]  I will face my fear.
[00:02:34.784 --> 00:02:37.866]  I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
[00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:41.470]  And when it has gone past me, I will turn to see fear's path.
[00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.072]  Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing.
[00:02:44.072 --> 00:02:45.133]  Only I will remain.
[00:02:47.304 --> 00:02:48.446]  And from the Book of Psalms,
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.564]  Fear is natural, but to dwell there only breeds despair.
[00:03:03.564 --> 00:03:11.571]  The power of our free will is most pertinent in the mind, where we have sway over our thoughts, focus, and decisions.
[00:03:11.571 --> 00:03:15.654]  Staying positive isn't just for restorative retreats on the beach.
[00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:17.916]  It's the solution to every problem we face.
[00:03:18.837 --> 00:03:25.344]  Even under the highest stress, the military is trained to maintain esprit de corps at all levels.
[00:03:25.344 --> 00:03:32.191]  A common spirit of a group, inspiring enthusiasm, devotion, and honor for that group.
[00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:35.995]  Positive feelings prevail in every endeavor, including battle.
[00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:40.495]  Artificial intelligence seems to understand this as well.
[00:03:40.495 --> 00:04:01.388]  In Cliff High's recent Shadow Wars, AI program ChatGPT was prompted to help develop a story about a world that has been ruled for thousands of years by a non-human species that hides in the shadows and uses media, government, and education to brainwash the masses and control them with fear.
[00:04:02.088 --> 00:04:10.592]  ChatGPT was asked, what strategies and tactics could the awake humans employ to defeat the enemy and awaken humanity?
[00:04:10.592 --> 00:04:23.838]  The AI program said that ultimately, the key to unlocking the trapped minds of the normal humans will be to appeal to their innate desires for freedom, autonomy, truth, and transparency.
[00:04:24.398 --> 00:04:36.637]  It recommended that the awake humans should expose the truth, mobilize the masses, and build alternative institutions that serve these values of individual freedom.
[00:04:36.637 --> 00:04:39.021]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:05.874]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[00:05:05.874 --> 00:05:08.055]  We made it even stronger.
[00:05:08.055 --> 00:05:11.777]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:05:11.777 --> 00:05:18.680]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.763]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:05:24.763 --> 00:05:26.164]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:05:26.844 --> 00:05:39.931]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:41.912]  It is the super fuel.
[00:05:41.912 --> 00:05:43.372]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:05:43.372 --> 00:05:44.253]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[00:05:44.253 --> 00:05:45.213]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:05:45.213 --> 00:05:46.394]  They go good with this.
[00:05:46.394 --> 00:05:48.415]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:05:49.136 --> 00:05:50.617]  This is the boss.
[00:05:50.617 --> 00:05:51.358]  TurboForce.
[00:05:51.358 --> 00:05:52.379]  Back in stock.
[00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:53.380]  Discounted.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.121]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:55.982]  More power.
[00:05:55.982 --> 00:05:56.983]  More strength.
[00:05:56.983 --> 00:06:01.807]  More energy.
[00:06:01.807 --> 00:06:05.630]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:12.885 --> 00:06:21.788]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:06:21.788 --> 00:06:31.332]  There's a lot of incredibly important news and developments on every front that we're going to be going over today.
[00:06:31.332 --> 00:06:32.993]  We have a really special guest.
[00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:39.469]  We had Dr. Rima Labo, who's one of the biggest medical whistleblowers ever, on last week.
[00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:46.672]  I had her on, like, many times until about a decade ago, and then a decade went by, like, ten seconds, and I'm like, she's still out doing shows?
[00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:48.092]  She's still speaking out?
[00:06:48.092 --> 00:06:48.792]  Let's get her on.
[00:06:48.792 --> 00:06:49.393]  It was amazing.
[00:06:49.393 --> 00:06:50.073]  It was informative.
[00:06:50.073 --> 00:06:51.093]  It was riveting.
[00:06:51.093 --> 00:06:52.534]  It was enlightening.
[00:06:52.534 --> 00:07:00.457]  I thought, who else is out there that's really iconic and interesting and was ahead of the curve that we haven't had on in years?
[00:07:01.591 --> 00:07:03.793]  And I guess that was in my subconscious mind.
[00:07:03.793 --> 00:07:15.004]  And then a few weeks ago, I had a dream with Ted Gunderson, Red Beckman and Bob Fletcher sitting around like a breakfast table.
[00:07:15.004 --> 00:07:16.645]  It wasn't at my house.
[00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:19.868]  And I was just talking about the current state of the New World Order.
[00:07:19.868 --> 00:07:24.253]  Well, Red Beckman's not with us.
[00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.374]  Neither is Ted Gunderson, but Robert Fletcher is.
[00:07:29.374 --> 00:07:31.217]  He has so much incredible research.
[00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:39.748]  He'll be joining us in the third hour, and we'll be going into the fourth hour that I'll be hosting as well.
[00:07:39.748 --> 00:07:43.733]  Roger Stone joins us in about 25 minutes to talk about
[00:07:45.148 --> 00:07:51.111]  Tucker Carlson, Biden's re-election announcement yesterday, and so much more.
[00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:57.195]  So you don't want to miss any of today's four-hour broadcast that I'll be hosting all four hours of.
[00:07:57.195 --> 00:07:59.816]  Okay.
[00:07:59.816 --> 00:08:01.837]  The Tucker thing's a lot bigger than Tucker Carlson.
[00:08:01.837 --> 00:08:02.758]  I think everybody knows that.
[00:08:02.758 --> 00:08:05.439]  It's the top story, really, in the world.
[00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:08.481]  Tucker did not have three and a half million viewers a night, sometimes as high as six.
[00:08:09.619 --> 00:08:11.781]  The Nielsen, all those systems are completely rigged.
[00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:18.387]  That's whoever is signed up with their internet box to track that they're watching it.
[00:08:18.387 --> 00:08:21.649]  Most of the leftists I know watch Fox News.
[00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:24.252]  You go into bars, restaurants, it's Fox News.
[00:08:24.252 --> 00:08:30.197]  Fox News has tens of millions of viewers at any one time.
[00:08:30.197 --> 00:08:35.501]  But to not make the rest of cable look so destroyed and so dominated, it's manipulated to keep the numbers down.
[00:08:35.501 --> 00:08:36.923]  Tucker Carlson had
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.942]  30, 40 million viewers a night.
[00:08:41.942 --> 00:08:59.668]  And Tucker Carlson, over the last 12 years or so that we've been friends, has gone through a process now where he really is the slicker, new and improved Alex Jones.
[00:08:59.668 --> 00:09:04.070]  And so that's exactly what I've been trying to have happen here.
[00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.071]  We've got Rogan pretty much there as well.
[00:09:07.868 --> 00:09:14.330]  And the more they mess with him, the more he gets hardcore.
[00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.690]  I know both these guys very well.
[00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.670]  I know Joe extremely well.
[00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:17.471]  25 years.
[00:09:17.471 --> 00:09:19.711]  Been longtime friends.
[00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:24.192]  And done a lot of hanging out, a lot of partying.
[00:09:24.192 --> 00:09:25.033]  Going way back.
[00:09:25.033 --> 00:09:27.253]  So I know Joe very well.
[00:09:27.253 --> 00:09:28.294]  And I know what he's made of.
[00:09:28.294 --> 00:09:36.796]  And I knew when they messed with him and attacked him and called him a liar, if I could just get him to attack the Globalist,
[00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:44.113]  That they'd attack him and then he would come completely over and it worked like a charm.
[00:09:44.113 --> 00:09:47.955]  So you see, that's my most important work.
[00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:51.657]  And that's your most important work is influencing others as well.
[00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:55.558]  So we've woken up hundreds of millions of people around the planet.
[00:09:55.558 --> 00:09:59.580]  We've changed the world together, all of you, the callers, the guests, this crew.
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.681]  And it's not about bragging.
[00:10:02.691 --> 00:10:14.840]  It's about recognizing that our blood, sweat, and tears has had a big effect, so you'll continue to recognize what your support and your blood, sweat, and tears have done, and so that others will be encouraged to continue on the fight.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:29.751]  Now that said, I know Tucker good, know him well, and I know he's the real deal, and we've had discussions that I won't get into here on air about what would happen if he was taken off the air and about new platforms.
[00:10:31.092 --> 00:10:38.234]  Had dinner with him and Roger for like three hours in Miami a few years ago, specifically on that topic.
[00:10:38.234 --> 00:10:42.935]  And I won't get into the inside baseball, but I'm sure people can put two and two together.
[00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:48.157]  Do you think Tucker's upset that he got fired and they've got to fulfill out his contract?
[00:10:48.157 --> 00:10:49.197]  No.
[00:10:49.197 --> 00:10:56.719]  The Daily Mail went to Boca Grande, where he lives about an hour and a half south of Sarasota.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:04.966]  And we'll put the photos on screen of he and his wife driving around in their little golf cart.
[00:11:04.966 --> 00:11:09.830]  And does he look like he's upset?
[00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:10.651]  No.
[00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:13.954]  He loves to go fishing and hunting this time of year.
[00:11:13.954 --> 00:11:16.096]  He loves to go to Maine, coming up in about a month.
[00:11:17.256 --> 00:11:19.417]  And he doesn't like being on air.
[00:11:19.417 --> 00:11:20.977]  He doesn't like being famous.
[00:11:20.977 --> 00:11:22.858]  He doesn't want to be president.
[00:11:22.858 --> 00:11:25.519]  But he really fundamentally hates these people.
[00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:30.361]  And now, Tucker Carlson's going to take a few months off.
[00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:44.686]  And then, I just have a feeling, he didn't tell me this, that right around November of this year,
[00:11:45.757 --> 00:11:55.842]  Into December, going into the election, that Tucker Carlson is going to launch a new sleek channel.
[00:11:55.842 --> 00:12:07.947]  And then he's going to expand all the shows around that channel, and it is going to explode.
[00:12:07.947 --> 00:12:13.730]  And I just can't imagine the type of host he's going to be getting to be on that network.
[00:12:16.647 --> 00:12:21.530]  I can't imagine who else he'll be putting on air.
[00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.931]  See, everybody keeps asking, will Tucker Carlson come to InfoWars?
[00:12:23.931 --> 00:12:27.413]  And the answer is, no, he will not be coming here.
[00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:28.794]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:12:28.794 --> 00:12:32.896]  But there isn't just evil in the world.
[00:12:32.896 --> 00:12:35.117]  These people aren't all powerful, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:35.117 --> 00:12:42.901]  So, last month, on March 8th, I talked about it for about 30 minutes.
[00:12:42.901 --> 00:12:44.242]  We're just going to play a two-minute clip here.
[00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:53.949]  I laid out the fact that not just the January 6th stuff, but the war stuff and the big pharma stuff, that Tucker was battling with the executives.
[00:12:53.949 --> 00:12:56.771]  And that's all come out now.
[00:12:56.771 --> 00:13:00.353]  And that they were censoring him when his contract said they can't.
[00:13:00.353 --> 00:13:13.700]  He turned down $30, $40, $50 million extra a year to get $19 million a year to be able to have control of his show.
[00:13:14.574 --> 00:13:16.795]  And they were cheating him.
[00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:18.336]  And he's pissed off about it.
[00:13:18.336 --> 00:13:22.819]  So of course he's calling the executive that's doing it a cunt in emails.
[00:13:22.819 --> 00:13:24.841]  Oh my gosh!
[00:13:24.841 --> 00:13:27.382]  Aren't we glad he was bucking them and fighting them?
[00:13:27.382 --> 00:13:32.185]  So this could have happened at any time.
[00:13:32.185 --> 00:13:35.788]  I know Tucker thought it was going to come even earlier.
[00:13:35.788 --> 00:13:41.952]  We hung out and got together and pow-wowed in Florida during the Thanksgiving break last year.
[00:13:41.952 --> 00:13:42.072]  And
[00:13:43.939 --> 00:13:52.143]  Tucker's very, very happy and very, very pleased because he's now taking the next step in being banned, the next step in being totally demonized.
[00:13:52.143 --> 00:13:54.664]  And when you're demonized by the bad guys, that's a good thing.
[00:13:54.664 --> 00:13:58.166]  So we're going to go to break, because I don't have time to play the whole clip here.
[00:13:58.166 --> 00:14:03.709]  And we'll come back and Alex predicts Tucker's departure at Fox on March 8th, last month.
[00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:08.451]  Just to show everybody that we're not here talking out of our rear ends.
[00:14:09.653 --> 00:14:24.222]  When I get up here and I tell you something, it's because I've done deep research, I have deep contacts, and I eat, drink, sleep, eat, drink, sleep, this information.
[00:14:24.222 --> 00:14:32.266]  In fact, I've got to control myself when I'm in the act of lovemaking with my wife to get work out of my head.
[00:14:32.266 --> 00:14:34.488]  I don't want to get graphic here, but sometimes she's like,
[00:14:35.339 --> 00:14:35.679]  Let's do it!
[00:14:56.567 --> 00:14:58.828]  Plant a garden with my daughter.
[00:14:58.828 --> 00:15:01.510]  Always focused on this because this is everything.
[00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:05.933]  And that's what Tucker's speech was so important at the Heritage Foundation on Friday.
[00:15:05.933 --> 00:15:09.775]  Where he said, this is not an argument or debate.
[00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:14.858]  This is not some real discussion about civilization and how to have a better civilization.
[00:15:14.858 --> 00:15:17.940]  These are people that want to destroy civilization and love death and destruction.
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.541]  This is good versus evil and we should pray.
[00:15:21.092 --> 00:15:29.396]  And I have confirmed they were planning to get rid of Carlson and not probably redo his contract that was up in less than a year.
[00:15:29.396 --> 00:15:33.458]  But they accelerated it with just how he was getting more and more hardcore in what he was doing.
[00:15:33.458 --> 00:15:35.519]  And he obviously knew what he was doing, pushing him into it.
[00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:41.542]  And the last straw was, the executives were watching, and Rupert Murdoch was watching that Heritage speech.
[00:15:41.542 --> 00:15:48.505]  And when he said, it's good versus evil, we gotta get God, we gotta repent, Rupert Murdoch broke up with his fiancée
[00:15:50.043 --> 00:15:55.352]  Over a meeting with her and Tucker Carlson at his house in Bel Air just a month ago.
[00:15:55.352 --> 00:15:56.614]  So this goes deep, folks.
[00:15:56.614 --> 00:15:57.416]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:57.416 --> 00:15:57.796]  Stay with us.
[00:16:00.307 --> 00:16:05.331]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:07.493]  We made it even stronger.
[00:16:07.493 --> 00:16:11.236]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:16.379]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:16:16.379 --> 00:16:24.206]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:16:24.206 --> 00:16:25.667]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:16:26.307 --> 00:16:39.370]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.350]  It is the super fuel.
[00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:42.831]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:43.691]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[00:16:43.691 --> 00:16:44.651]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:16:44.651 --> 00:16:45.832]  They go good with this.
[00:16:45.832 --> 00:16:47.852]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.071]  This is the boss.
[00:16:50.071 --> 00:16:50.811]  TurboForce.
[00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:51.832]  Back in stock.
[00:16:51.832 --> 00:16:52.832]  Discounted.
[00:16:52.832 --> 00:16:54.553]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:54.553 --> 00:16:55.434]  More power.
[00:16:55.434 --> 00:16:56.434]  More strength.
[00:16:56.434 --> 00:17:00.276]  More energy.
[00:17:00.276 --> 00:17:06.940]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.881]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:17:08.881 --> 00:17:10.382]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[00:17:10.382 --> 00:17:13.184]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[00:17:13.184 --> 00:17:15.185]  And it says, political prisoner.
[00:17:15.985 --> 00:17:17.926]  With an image of President Trump.
[00:17:17.926 --> 00:17:20.387]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[00:17:20.387 --> 00:17:22.508]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:24.089]  Political Prisoner.
[00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:29.111]  With Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[00:17:29.111 --> 00:17:30.152]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:17:30.152 --> 00:17:34.294]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:17:34.294 --> 00:17:35.894]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[00:17:35.894 --> 00:17:36.915]  No, I'm not running for President.
[00:17:36.915 --> 00:17:39.456]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[00:17:39.456 --> 00:17:40.236]  Red, white, and blue.
[00:17:40.236 --> 00:17:41.137]  Alex Jones for President.
[00:17:41.137 --> 00:17:41.557]  2024.
[00:17:41.557 --> 00:17:43.718]  It's a fun conversational piece.
[00:17:43.718 --> 00:17:44.658]  And a limited edition shirt.
[00:17:44.658 --> 00:17:45.419]  Great way to fund.
[00:17:45.819 --> 00:17:48.701]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[00:18:08.143 --> 00:18:09.484]  I want you all to know something.
[00:18:09.484 --> 00:18:11.424]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:14.966]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[00:18:14.966 --> 00:18:17.927]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:18:17.927 --> 00:18:22.348]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up, or rub it down.
[00:18:22.348 --> 00:18:24.569]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:18:24.569 --> 00:18:28.071]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:18:28.071 --> 00:18:31.532]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:18:31.812 --> 00:18:34.674]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:18:34.674 --> 00:18:35.715]  Years ago.
[00:18:35.715 --> 00:18:37.797]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[00:18:37.797 --> 00:18:39.778]  Not for a second.
[00:18:39.778 --> 00:18:42.300]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.762]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:18:44.762 --> 00:18:47.884]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:18:47.884 --> 00:18:49.446]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[00:18:49.446 --> 00:18:52.548]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:05.665]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[00:20:00.976 --> 00:20:05.597]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:05.597 --> 00:20:11.858]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:11.858 --> 00:20:14.279]  If you leave me
[00:20:30.405 --> 00:20:34.549]  We're gonna take America back.
[00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:42.215]  First America, and our storied beloved Republic.
[00:20:42.215 --> 00:20:43.236]  And then the world.
[00:20:43.236 --> 00:20:44.217]  Through ideas.
[00:20:44.217 --> 00:20:44.617]  Through Veritas.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:10.945]  Gleeful Tucker Carlson tells DailyMail.com his future plans.
[00:21:10.945 --> 00:21:12.166]  Appetizers plus entree.
[00:21:12.166 --> 00:21:16.590]  Looks like Tucker Carlson doesn't give two fox about his ouster from the network.
[00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:23.897]  Gleefully telling DailyMail.com his future plans while tooling off to a romantic date night with his wife Susan.
[00:21:24.977 --> 00:21:27.078]  He was blindsided by the news.
[00:21:27.078 --> 00:21:28.679]  He was let go from Fox.
[00:21:28.679 --> 00:21:31.761]  I haven't eaten dinner with my wife on the weeknight in seven years.
[00:21:31.761 --> 00:21:34.883]  The TV firebrand told the Daily Mail and they talked to him on the street.
[00:21:34.883 --> 00:21:43.649]  Hunter spent Tuesday huddling with right-hand man Justin Wells, who lost his executive producer gig at the Cable Network.
[00:21:43.649 --> 00:21:45.991]  Veterans plotted their next move.
[00:21:47.742 --> 00:21:52.206]  But I think there's been some plotting going on long before this.
[00:21:52.206 --> 00:21:58.131]  I just might have been around during a little of that, but I don't know.
[00:21:58.131 --> 00:21:59.432]  Maybe not.
[00:21:59.432 --> 00:22:02.635]  Maybe everybody can just wait and see.
[00:22:02.635 --> 00:22:04.177]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:22:04.177 --> 00:22:08.320]  This is very profound and it's very simple, but it's absolutely critical and beyond key.
[00:22:10.523 --> 00:22:12.604]  The New World Order is reviled!
[00:22:12.604 --> 00:22:14.165]  Bill Gates is reviled!
[00:22:14.165 --> 00:22:15.846]  Klaus Schwab is reviled!
[00:22:15.846 --> 00:22:20.848]  There's videos with 5, 10, 15 million views on YouTube and on Twitter, on Instagram.
[00:22:20.848 --> 00:22:30.573]  We've shown you where 99.999% of the comments, you gotta read a thousand comments, where you find one pro Bill Gates comment and the people are awake.
[00:22:30.573 --> 00:22:33.635]  That was years ago.
[00:22:33.635 --> 00:22:37.597]  Nobody wants to eat bugs no matter how many Hollywood stars they pay to go out and promote it.
[00:22:37.597 --> 00:22:39.058]  We got some news on that, big news today.
[00:22:40.276 --> 00:22:48.628]  People don't want their power cut off, they don't want electric cars that don't work, they don't want a bridge to nowhere, they don't want the New World Order.
[00:22:48.628 --> 00:22:54.757]  And so Tucker Carlson has just said, I'm not going along with it, and you're not going along with it, and none of us are, and it's fun to fight these people.
[00:22:56.732 --> 00:22:59.774]  Their president can't even string a sentence together.
[00:22:59.774 --> 00:23:01.655]  Of course they stole the election.
[00:23:01.655 --> 00:23:04.697]  And upwards of 80% of Americans in major polls know that.
[00:23:04.697 --> 00:23:08.900]  And 87% of Americans know they can't scrounge together $1,000 if they need it.
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.982]  They're living paycheck to paycheck.
[00:23:10.982 --> 00:23:15.845]  These people have robbed us by design to make us poor, to control us in their own words.
[00:23:15.845 --> 00:23:17.226]  You'll own nothing and you'll be happy.
[00:23:18.174 --> 00:23:18.775]  B.S.
[00:23:18.775 --> 00:23:20.516]  Klaus Schwab, B.S.
[00:23:20.516 --> 00:23:22.758]  Lord Rothschild, B.S.
[00:23:22.758 --> 00:23:24.819]  John Kerry, B.S.
[00:23:24.819 --> 00:23:26.521]  Barack Obama, B.S.
[00:23:26.521 --> 00:23:28.482]  Hillary Clinton, B.S.
[00:23:28.482 --> 00:23:35.728]  Jim Psaki, and all the rest of you, and the dumbass AOC puppet.
[00:23:35.728 --> 00:23:38.731]  So, they try to break our spirit, they try to break our will.
[00:23:41.994 --> 00:23:47.995]  They are going to do no such thing as long as the people have faith and spread the word of support.
[00:23:47.995 --> 00:23:51.236]  I have a lot of other news I want to hit on this and Roger Stone is coming up.
[00:23:51.236 --> 00:23:58.698]  Let's play just a short clip of where I lay out my prediction on March 8th that he would be leaving Fox very soon.
[00:23:58.698 --> 00:23:59.838]  Here it is.
[00:23:59.838 --> 00:24:04.760]  Okay, let me try to judiciously go through what's really happening with Tucker Carlson.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.560]  He was set to deliver the goods last night.
[00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.832]  On federal agents, provocateurs, in the crowd.
[00:24:11.832 --> 00:24:16.894]  Ray Epps 2.0, Ray Epps 3.0, Ray Epps 4.0, up to Ray Epps 500.
[00:24:16.894 --> 00:24:20.195]  I mean there was at least 500 of them there, we know that.
[00:24:20.195 --> 00:24:21.476]  That's come out.
[00:24:21.476 --> 00:24:26.318]  But the specifics, the video, that's why the Deep State made major threats to Fox.
[00:24:26.318 --> 00:24:34.421]  Senator Schumer, who's a main representative of the Deep State, went to the Senate floor and threatened Fox and said, we'll shut you down.
[00:24:34.421 --> 00:24:36.742]  Massive pressure was placed and
[00:24:38.035 --> 00:24:49.978]  From the intel I've got, there's a whole internal fight going on about what is going to come out, and what was supposed to come out last night, and tonight and tomorrow got postponed.
[00:24:49.978 --> 00:24:51.838]  If Tucker has his way, it will come out.
[00:24:51.838 --> 00:24:52.998]  He said that at the end.
[00:24:52.998 --> 00:24:55.859]  In fact, guys, go to the very end of Tucker's show last night.
[00:24:55.859 --> 00:24:56.739]  I know we streamed it live.
[00:24:56.739 --> 00:25:02.960]  We have a copy of it on Mando Video, where he says, they want to stop this coming out, but I assure you it will come out.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.301]  And I believe Tucker.
[00:25:04.301 --> 00:25:05.281]  He's hardcore.
[00:25:05.281 --> 00:25:05.801]  He's awake.
[00:25:06.681 --> 00:25:07.922]  The left admits it.
[00:25:07.922 --> 00:25:08.983]  Tucker says it.
[00:25:08.983 --> 00:25:10.985]  I helped wake him up in radicalizing.
[00:25:10.985 --> 00:25:12.146]  He gets what's going on.
[00:25:12.146 --> 00:25:13.407]  He's not going back.
[00:25:13.407 --> 00:25:15.088]  He believes in the people.
[00:25:15.088 --> 00:25:20.653]  And so I predict he won't be at Fox News in the near future if he's unable to put this out.
[00:25:20.653 --> 00:25:23.015]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:25:23.015 --> 00:25:24.797]  But that's speaking from my perspective.
[00:25:24.797 --> 00:25:25.738]  I'm not speaking for Tucker.
[00:25:26.713 --> 00:25:31.956]  Now Cheryl Atkinson from her sources says that there was a fight and they're trying to block the release.
[00:25:31.956 --> 00:25:34.838]  Steve Bannon says Murdoch shut down Tucker.
[00:25:34.838 --> 00:25:39.480]  They can basically see the same information with some of the same sources I have.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.863]  That said, this is again bigger than just January 6th.
[00:25:43.863 --> 00:25:49.546]  They're branding the American people as terrorists officially using this event.
[00:25:49.546 --> 00:25:51.467]  Maybe 50 people were violent?
[00:25:51.467 --> 00:25:53.368]  A million plus showed up?
[00:25:53.368 --> 00:25:54.569]  Maybe a thousand went in?
[00:25:55.703 --> 00:25:56.663]  Brought in by the police.
[00:25:56.663 --> 00:25:59.064]  I tried to stop them.
[00:25:59.064 --> 00:26:07.106]  But this is about the power of the system trying to gaslight us that it's rewriting history to show footage that shows they lied.
[00:26:07.106 --> 00:26:08.546]  Well, yeah.
[00:26:08.546 --> 00:26:15.708]  Rewriting history is not a bad thing when you find out the truth about history.
[00:26:15.708 --> 00:26:22.690]  OK, so we're going to have Roger Stone talking about this window into the deep state and what's really going on at Fox News.
[00:26:23.663 --> 00:26:26.664]  And what this signifies in the next round of censorship and control.
[00:26:26.664 --> 00:26:34.505]  But I will guarantee you this, Tucker Carlson will be back, stronger and more hardcore than ever, by early next year.
[00:26:34.505 --> 00:26:39.606]  Mark this down, save this date, and watch it come true, unless they put a bullet in his ass.
[00:26:39.606 --> 00:26:44.248]  And that's my real concern, and I've told him, the guy doesn't really have security.
[00:26:44.248 --> 00:26:49.329]  He's got the Second Amendment, which is good, but he's too important, and he's got the money,
[00:26:52.492 --> 00:26:54.753]  He needs to have security.
[00:26:54.753 --> 00:26:56.453]  He needs to have it.
[00:26:56.453 --> 00:26:57.734]  And security is low key.
[00:26:57.734 --> 00:26:58.274]  It's just there.
[00:26:58.274 --> 00:26:59.654]  They're great people.
[00:26:59.654 --> 00:27:06.976]  And you need to have it because I can't be sitting there with a gun all the time, just waiting for somebody to try to kill me, which has happened.
[00:27:06.976 --> 00:27:16.299]  We don't get into it on air, but it's not just the Daily Mail going to stalk him in his neighborhood and talk to him on the street.
[00:27:16.299 --> 00:27:18.620]  It's other people.
[00:27:20.177 --> 00:27:22.279]  So, we need to pray for Tucker.
[00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:23.100]  All right, we're gonna go to break.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.143]  Come back with Roger Stone and more.
[00:27:26.143 --> 00:27:27.704]  We're not funded by the Globalists.
[00:27:27.704 --> 00:27:28.785]  I don't have a war chest.
[00:27:28.785 --> 00:27:29.386]  I'm out of money.
[00:27:29.386 --> 00:27:31.808]  But the show is more effective and popular than ever.
[00:27:32.614 --> 00:27:39.340]  But because of the economy imploding and the rest of it, we're barely paying the bills around here, which is ridiculous because we've got amazing products.
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:43.424]  The Nitric Boost that cleans out your blood and battles all the garbage that's out there.
[00:27:43.424 --> 00:27:47.187]  It's so critical and does so much for your body and so much for your health.
[00:27:47.187 --> 00:27:50.370]  That is in stock and discounted at FullWarStore.com.
[00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:51.310]  Everybody should be taking it.
[00:27:52.328 --> 00:27:55.410]  We've got back in stock Turbo Force, been sold out for eight months.
[00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:59.171]  Strongest nootropic energy that's clean.
[00:27:59.171 --> 00:28:01.853]  Got a bunch of different energy compounds that time-release.
[00:28:01.853 --> 00:28:02.693]  So it hits right away.
[00:28:02.693 --> 00:28:09.556]  And then it has very expensive ingredients, though the product isn't expensive.
[00:28:09.556 --> 00:28:11.277]  Most people, you know, mark stuff up three or four times.
[00:28:11.277 --> 00:28:11.797]  We don't do that.
[00:28:11.797 --> 00:28:15.539]  So we put the money into the product and it'll give you a great deal.
[00:28:15.539 --> 00:28:18.361]  It's got all these great compounds that time-release.
[00:28:19.865 --> 00:28:25.711]  And so, on average, 8 to 12 hours of energy, so we say 10 hours.
[00:28:25.711 --> 00:28:26.912]  That's about the average.
[00:28:26.912 --> 00:28:33.580]  TurboForce, discounted, back in stock, InfoWarsTore.com and everybody, including women, should be taking
[00:28:35.017 --> 00:28:37.938]  With all the estrogen mimickers that are out there to block them.
[00:28:37.938 --> 00:28:42.719]  1776 Testosterone Boost to help keep the free testosterone in your body.
[00:28:42.719 --> 00:28:46.039]  It's not just men that have testosterone, but in women as well.
[00:28:46.039 --> 00:28:48.600]  Available so it gets to you.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.180]  1776 Testosterone Boost.
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.361]  Selling out quick.
[00:28:51.361 --> 00:28:54.361]  It's at InfoWarsStore.com and it funds our operation.
[00:28:54.361 --> 00:28:57.222]  1776 Testosterone Boost from InfoWars Platinum.
[00:29:00.293 --> 00:29:06.277]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the Globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[00:29:06.277 --> 00:29:08.939]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[00:29:08.939 --> 00:29:11.120]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.702]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[00:29:13.702 --> 00:29:16.924]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:29:16.924 --> 00:29:18.685]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[00:29:18.685 --> 00:29:25.310]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:28.112]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:29:29.079 --> 00:29:30.820]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:29:59.019 --> 00:29:59.230]  Watch!
[00:30:08.291 --> 00:30:17.015]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements, because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:19.195]  So support InfoWars Store.
[00:30:19.195 --> 00:30:30.360]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority, because you don't know, I don't know, Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes, and again, magnesium is critical for your
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.321]  Muscles and everything.
[00:30:32.321 --> 00:30:33.222]  Krill oil.
[00:30:33.222 --> 00:30:41.026]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[00:30:41.026 --> 00:30:47.030]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come.
[00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.771]  Vitamin C and Zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[00:30:49.771 --> 00:30:51.953]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[00:30:51.953 --> 00:30:53.854]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[00:30:53.854 --> 00:30:57.216]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[00:30:57.216 --> 00:30:59.237]  You have to have these products.
[00:31:01.089 --> 00:31:04.251]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:31:04.251 --> 00:31:06.532]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:31:06.532 --> 00:31:10.474]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:31:10.474 --> 00:31:19.398]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:31:19.398 --> 00:31:26.301]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[00:31:26.301 --> 00:31:27.202]  It's really just incredible.
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.863]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:31:31.863 --> 00:31:37.647]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:31:37.647 --> 00:31:40.689]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:31:40.689 --> 00:31:47.734]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[00:31:47.734 --> 00:31:48.915]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[00:31:49.615 --> 00:31:53.916]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at MFORESTORE.com.
[00:31:53.916 --> 00:31:58.857]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to MFORESTORE.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:31:58.857 --> 00:31:59.857]  Please take action now.
[00:31:59.857 --> 00:32:05.559]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth.
[00:32:05.559 --> 00:32:08.239]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[00:32:08.239 --> 00:32:10.340]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.600]  Period.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.681]  Case closed.
[00:32:12.681 --> 00:32:14.061]  Out to get you and your family.
[00:32:14.061 --> 00:32:19.043]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patron Supply Ready Hour Group.
[00:32:19.043 --> 00:32:20.443]  It's been around about 15 years.
[00:32:20.443 --> 00:32:22.344]  Became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:32:22.344 --> 00:32:29.906]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good
[00:32:30.726 --> 00:32:35.088]  In all the studies, it reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[00:32:35.088 --> 00:32:36.608]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[00:32:36.608 --> 00:32:39.430]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:44.652]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[00:32:44.652 --> 00:32:50.134]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:51.775]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:32:51.775 --> 00:32:53.355]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:32:53.355 --> 00:32:54.896]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:32:54.896 --> 00:32:57.477]  The point is, you can get the filters at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:32:57.477 --> 00:32:58.678]  They're discounted right now.
[00:32:58.678 --> 00:32:59.398]  Finally back in stock.
[00:33:01.334 --> 00:33:07.253]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:14.248 --> 00:33:15.488]  You found it.
[00:33:15.488 --> 00:33:17.509]  The tip of the spear.
[00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:19.751]  It is the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:41.151]  Younger folks to the, or newly awakened folks, to the reality of the world and how the globalists operate and how there's a battle against that, a battle for human future.
[00:33:41.151 --> 00:33:44.611]  And we're going to hit so much whistleblower to tell House that U.S.
[00:33:44.611 --> 00:33:52.233]  government is middleman in multi-billion dollar migrant child trafficking operation, including forced labor and sex slavery.
[00:33:52.233 --> 00:33:55.013]  Now, what did I tell you Monday?
[00:33:55.013 --> 00:33:59.274]  I said I met via Zoom with high level
[00:34:01.008 --> 00:34:09.290]  It's not just FBI, not just federal marshals, not just, I'm going to leave it, not just journalists, but with high-level federal officials.
[00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:11.250]  It's off record.
[00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:15.331]  It's, it's, we're not going to say who, but we're working on this as well.
[00:34:15.331 --> 00:34:20.532]  And they were frustrated because this was brought to Fox News a month ago and nothing was done.
[00:34:20.532 --> 00:34:22.413]  They have the court documents, everything, okay?
[00:34:22.413 --> 00:34:24.753]  This is, this is absolutely proven.
[00:34:24.753 --> 00:34:27.034]  I told you this is about to break and the whole plan was
[00:34:27.998 --> 00:34:33.160]  They know they're under surveillance, and they know as soon as I'm being given the information, they would force that on Fox.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:33.460]  Boom!
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.120]  Plan worked again, bitches!
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.201]  Yeah!
[00:34:36.201 --> 00:34:39.182]  That's what we're here for, to force everything out.
[00:34:39.182 --> 00:34:45.043]  But you're going to be getting that in the next few weeks, huge, over the top, even before Congress has the hearings.
[00:34:45.043 --> 00:34:49.645]  I told you Monday, congressional hearings on giant sex slavery with the Democrats making money off of it.
[00:34:50.265 --> 00:34:52.406]  Smoking gun, ultramassive next hour.
[00:34:52.406 --> 00:34:53.787]  So, you see all these other stats?
[00:34:53.787 --> 00:35:00.952]  I've got economy news, war news, AI news, Japan's spaceship crashes on the moon, all of it.
[00:35:00.952 --> 00:35:09.898]  But the great Roger Stone, another embattled man, who has gone through the fires of hell and come out stronger, and his faith redoubled in the Lord,
[00:35:10.939 --> 00:35:22.042]  Joins us, and from all my intel, I'll leave it at that, they were planning to get rid of Tucker, they didn't know what to do, but his speech calling on God and saying good versus evil pushed him over the edge.
[00:35:22.042 --> 00:35:33.885]  There was a meeting a month before in Bel Air at the big vineyard mansion of Rupert Murdoch with his then-fiancée, who's a big fan of Tucker, she asked him to be there, and they're sitting there and they're reading the Bible together.
[00:35:34.622 --> 00:35:36.464]  Well, that's what I've done with Tucker.
[00:35:36.464 --> 00:35:37.666]  This is real, folks.
[00:35:37.666 --> 00:35:39.168]  And Tucker didn't used to be really religious.
[00:35:39.168 --> 00:35:45.937]  He did not believe in God, but he was like, but when you see the real evil in the world, you see how they push it to their own detriment, you understand it's a plan.
[00:35:45.937 --> 00:35:47.279]  And Roger talks about that.
[00:35:47.279 --> 00:35:49.982]  So, the final straw was the heritage speech.
[00:35:50.623 --> 00:35:59.828]  Not just the anti-war, not just exposing the vaccine, not just exposing open borders, not just exposing the deep state spying, but calling on God and saying we should all pray.
[00:35:59.828 --> 00:36:01.709]  That's what they can't stand.
[00:36:01.709 --> 00:36:05.711]  So we have Roger Stone, who's been a former Fox contributor himself.
[00:36:05.711 --> 00:36:07.272]  Secret contract, can't talk about it.
[00:36:07.272 --> 00:36:08.233]  That's how they control everybody.
[00:36:08.233 --> 00:36:09.994]  He's not been in that contract for years.
[00:36:09.994 --> 00:36:13.596]  But Roger, I want to get your take on this because this is a big deal and
[00:36:14.542 --> 00:36:37.357]  You know, we had dinner, won't get into the details of it, specifically on deplatforming, specifically on alternate plans, a few years ago in Miami with Tucker, and we've of course, both of us had subsequent other meetings with him, but the point is, Tucker is very pleased, we'll put the photos up of him, a little birdie told me that something big's about to come out of this, and Tucker is just as pleased as punched.
[00:36:37.357 --> 00:36:37.837]  Roger Stone.
[00:36:39.502 --> 00:36:49.730]  Well, Alex, I grieve not for our friend, Tucker Carlson, because he is more than just a TV talk show host.
[00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:56.135]  He's the single most influential conservative commentator in the country today.
[00:36:56.135 --> 00:37:00.419]  And they're not going to be able to hide that light under a bushel.
[00:37:00.419 --> 00:37:06.444]  So wherever he goes, whatever he chooses to do next, and I kind of hope it's some
[00:37:07.293 --> 00:37:20.076]  combination of print journalism, because he's a brilliant writer, as well as some video, either net-based or cable presence, he's going to be massively successful.
[00:37:20.076 --> 00:37:35.119]  No, I grieve for our country because what this move has done is there is really no last vestige of alternative narrative discussion on cable television.
[00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:39.962]  Now, cable overall, I think, is a dying medium.
[00:37:39.962 --> 00:37:45.825]  Cable ultimately will go the way of broadcast television.
[00:37:45.825 --> 00:37:52.349]  NBC, CBS, ABC, their numbers, as you know, are in the toilet.
[00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:55.931]  Millions are watching us here on InfoWars.
[00:37:55.931 --> 00:38:00.414]  Millions watching on other web-based platforms.
[00:38:00.414 --> 00:38:02.715]  If you look at the two remaining
[00:38:03.616 --> 00:38:04.696]  I think?
[00:38:22.868 --> 00:38:26.513]  What specific event led to this?
[00:38:26.513 --> 00:38:36.186]  But our nation will be poorer for it because cable television has now been completely cancelled and censored.
[00:38:36.186 --> 00:38:40.631]  Whether it was Tucker's exposure of what really happened on January 6th,
[00:38:41.472 --> 00:38:52.223]  Or whether it was his discussion of the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop, or whether it was calling out the deep state on their efforts to push us into World War III.
[00:38:52.223 --> 00:38:54.706]  That's kind of a biggie.
[00:38:54.706 --> 00:38:56.808]  Whether it was giving Robert Kennedy...
[00:38:58.041 --> 00:39:00.063]  When nobody else would.
[00:39:00.063 --> 00:39:08.691]  When Robert Kennedy did his announcement, which I found very interesting, by the way, on Facebook, he was censored within five minutes.
[00:39:08.691 --> 00:39:10.934]  Facebook Live shut him down.
[00:39:10.934 --> 00:39:12.115]  And they were pulling fire alarms.
[00:39:14.448 --> 00:39:18.212]  Yeah, I mean look, ideas are dangerous to these people.
[00:39:18.212 --> 00:39:29.702]  Now you can go on the internet right now and you'll see these bots constantly saying the Robert Kennedy candidacy is a product of Roger Stone and Steve Bennett.
[00:39:29.702 --> 00:39:30.223]  Nonsense!
[00:39:31.342 --> 00:39:32.523]  He's an acquaintance of mine.
[00:39:32.523 --> 00:39:34.364]  I wouldn't call us close friends.
[00:39:34.364 --> 00:39:42.547]  I admire his views on the neocons, on the globalists, on the government corporate takeover of America.
[00:39:42.547 --> 00:39:44.188]  The merger of corporations and government.
[00:39:44.188 --> 00:39:44.848]  The fascism.
[00:39:44.848 --> 00:39:45.789]  He's dead on.
[00:39:46.977 --> 00:39:56.628]  You know they killed his uncle, they killed his father, so therefore he has to be cognizant of the fact that what he's doing is extraordinarily dangerous.
[00:39:56.628 --> 00:40:03.597]  So was it this interview that helped contribute to Tucker's being removed?
[00:40:03.597 --> 00:40:04.458]  I don't think we'll ever
[00:40:04.838 --> 00:40:05.199]  Really?
[00:40:05.199 --> 00:40:05.239]  No.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:28.641]  And I was going to go out there a long time ago, and his Fox Nation show, and they said no.
[00:40:28.641 --> 00:40:31.202]  And he's like, well, my contract says I could do this.
[00:40:31.202 --> 00:40:34.783]  I took a major pay cut of two-thirds to do this.
[00:40:34.783 --> 00:40:36.443]  And so he was pissed about that.
[00:40:36.443 --> 00:40:37.663]  And we talked about it on Thanksgiving.
[00:40:37.663 --> 00:40:39.204]  I won't get into the details about it.
[00:40:39.204 --> 00:40:40.344]  So there was that.
[00:40:40.344 --> 00:40:42.104]  And they were just mad about everything.
[00:40:42.104 --> 00:40:46.505]  They quote said in the emails, he's out of control, uncontrollable.
[00:40:46.505 --> 00:40:48.086]  So we know it was all of it.
[00:40:48.086 --> 00:40:49.266]  It was hitting on all cylinders.
[00:40:49.266 --> 00:40:49.846]  That's why it happened.
[00:40:51.701 --> 00:40:57.525]  I have a theory that maybe it's not what he's done in the past, but what they feared he might do in the future.
[00:40:57.525 --> 00:41:05.451]  I was going to say that earlier, like the war and everything else and like January 6th, they don't want him there knowing he's such a truth teller.
[00:41:05.451 --> 00:41:06.271]  That's it.
[00:41:06.271 --> 00:41:09.374]  He was removed for what he would do in the future.
[00:41:09.374 --> 00:41:14.037]  Here's the political problem though from my point of view and that is we have a lot of Americans
[00:41:15.321 --> 00:41:17.003]  Sixty and over.
[00:41:17.003 --> 00:41:21.066]  Many of them are right-of-center, many of them conservatives.
[00:41:21.066 --> 00:41:24.509]  They're not particularly net-savvy.
[00:41:24.509 --> 00:41:32.775]  They're used to turning on the television and getting Tucker Carlson, or turning on the television and getting the programming that they want.
[00:41:33.435 --> 00:41:43.019]  So, the problem here is that I think conservative media, alternative media, continues to be ghettoized.
[00:41:43.019 --> 00:41:47.121]  Yes, we can talk to our own people, and that has value.
[00:41:47.121 --> 00:41:49.262]  I mean, there's no question that that has value.
[00:41:49.262 --> 00:41:50.523]  That's why we've got to do what you do.
[00:41:50.523 --> 00:41:51.903]  We've got to do more outreach.
[00:41:51.903 --> 00:41:54.985]  That's why I don't like doing a bunch of interviews, but I do them on talk radio.
[00:41:54.985 --> 00:41:55.845]  I do them on other shows.
[00:41:55.845 --> 00:41:57.046]  I go on leftist shows.
[00:41:57.046 --> 00:42:00.067]  I go to leftist panels that go viral because that's how I get out of the ghetto.
[00:42:00.067 --> 00:42:00.687]  Exactly.
[00:42:00.687 --> 00:42:02.168]  We can't just sit here in the church
[00:42:09.918 --> 00:42:13.319]  Absolutely true.
[00:42:13.319 --> 00:42:16.280]  I think that's why you never turn down any opportunity.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:22.382]  You know that old Gord Vidal saying, never pass up the opportunity to be on television or to have sex.
[00:42:22.382 --> 00:42:27.264]  Well, on the first part of that, I strongly agree.
[00:42:27.264 --> 00:42:28.584]  I'm too old for the other part.
[00:42:32.134 --> 00:42:34.016]  It's a famous saying, as you know.
[00:42:34.016 --> 00:42:38.598]  No, Tucker Carlson will be fine, but the question is, how will America be?
[00:42:38.598 --> 00:42:39.339]  That's the real question.
[00:42:39.339 --> 00:42:40.520]  I totally agree, Roger.
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.542]  And again, I don't want to say this is a positive thing.
[00:42:43.542 --> 00:42:44.942]  In many aspects, it's not, and you're right.
[00:42:44.942 --> 00:42:54.969]  It shows they're still pushing the censorship, the surveillance, the incredible hearings the last month that exposed everything that you and I and others went through and how it was pointed at the entire American people and how they helped steal the election with that.
[00:42:54.969 --> 00:42:58.751]  That's proven, regardless of machines or mail-in ballots and all the rest of that.
[00:42:58.751 --> 00:42:59.631]  It's almost a red herring.
[00:43:00.532 --> 00:43:05.395]  This is a sign of desperation by them to get rid of the number one talk show, political talk show.
[00:43:05.395 --> 00:43:07.036]  Not just here, it was big around the world.
[00:43:07.036 --> 00:43:10.238]  To kill that showed the incredible behind-the-scenes pressure.
[00:43:10.238 --> 00:43:12.599]  That's not a sign of strength by the establishment.
[00:43:12.599 --> 00:43:13.420]  That's a sign of weakness.
[00:43:14.679 --> 00:43:19.462]  Well, I also think it is there's going to be a cleansing, a further cleansing at Fox.
[00:43:19.462 --> 00:43:27.628]  I expect Judge Jeanine Pirro, a good friend of mine, another truth teller, I expect she won't be there much longer.
[00:43:27.628 --> 00:43:40.116]  Maria Bartiromo, who I don't know, but who I greatly admire as a trailblazing reporter, who's fearless in what she covers, I suspect she too will be gone.
[00:43:40.116 --> 00:43:41.677]  I did think that Sean Hannity's
[00:43:42.397 --> 00:43:43.277]  We're good to go.
[00:44:07.726 --> 00:44:09.347]  You can barely call them conservatives.
[00:44:09.347 --> 00:44:12.789]  You're George W. Bush conservatives.
[00:44:12.789 --> 00:44:17.031]  You're so-called neo-conservatives who are not really conservatives.
[00:44:17.031 --> 00:44:17.892]  You just nailed it.
[00:44:17.892 --> 00:44:23.295]  As Trump said last week, the old neocon order, the country club republican order, is dead.
[00:44:23.295 --> 00:44:24.636]  It is dead with the population.
[00:44:24.636 --> 00:44:25.956]  But this is their counter-strike.
[00:44:25.956 --> 00:44:28.338]  This is their desperate attempt to maintain control.
[00:44:28.338 --> 00:44:28.938]  Can you speak to that?
[00:44:30.106 --> 00:44:33.407]  Yeah, Paul Ryan is the classic example of this.
[00:44:33.407 --> 00:44:37.169]  Paul Ryan grows out of the Jack Kemp tradition.
[00:44:37.169 --> 00:44:41.391]  But like many who goes to Washington, he becomes corrupted over time.
[00:44:41.391 --> 00:44:49.615]  And today he is a neocon Republican on the board of Fox, according to some of the emails that have been published.
[00:44:49.615 --> 00:44:54.397]  He is a major factor in the sacking of Tucker Carlson.
[00:44:55.257 --> 00:45:00.803]  I think it's very clear, Alex, that Fox is no longer about making money.
[00:45:00.803 --> 00:45:03.485]  They're not interested in making money.
[00:45:03.485 --> 00:45:06.188]  If they were, they just killed their biggest cash cow.
[00:45:06.869 --> 00:45:10.690]  I mean, Tucker Carlson was a huge moneymaker for them.
[00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:17.673]  They could pay more for their advertising, charge more for their advertising because of the enormous numbers that he ran.
[00:45:17.673 --> 00:45:23.535]  So they would rather be politically correct than profitable.
[00:45:23.535 --> 00:45:28.457]  And look, the idea of Brian Kilmeade stepping up in Tucker's stead.
[00:45:29.553 --> 00:45:30.995]  That's really pathetic.
[00:45:30.995 --> 00:45:32.196]  There's just no other way to put it.
[00:45:32.196 --> 00:45:51.012]  And really, let's expand on this, and Tucker did not say it was off the record, but I never talked about it, but that particular dinner we had for two and a half, three hours in Miami a year and a half, two years ago, where it was all about deplatforming plans, alternative systems, without getting into all the details, I don't know Tucker's plans, but it's come out that he is planning something.
[00:45:51.012 --> 00:45:55.937]  The best thing for him to do would be launch his new show at the end of the year, early next year,
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:11.014]  And then, hire as reporters at first people that do like once a week special reports, a Laura Logan, I know you already have your other show, but a Roger Stone, you know, maybe even bring in a Lou Dobbs.
[00:46:11.014 --> 00:46:15.519]  You know, the point is these are all the super heavy hitters that have already been censored, already been blocked.
[00:46:15.879 --> 00:46:28.709]  And then with Tucker at the helm of that, but also with articles being written about it, and with producers fact-checking everything before it goes out, it would be absolutely explosive, and it's the thing to do.
[00:46:28.709 --> 00:46:31.131]  And so I predict that's what Tucker's gonna do.
[00:46:33.789 --> 00:46:39.833]  From your mouth to God's ears, I think his next act is going to be his greatest act of all.
[00:46:39.833 --> 00:46:40.633]  He's young.
[00:46:40.633 --> 00:46:42.414]  He's vital.
[00:46:42.414 --> 00:46:44.216]  He's determined.
[00:46:44.216 --> 00:46:46.777]  He's a man of enormous courage.
[00:46:46.777 --> 00:46:49.199]  I don't think he saw this coming.
[00:46:49.199 --> 00:47:00.447]  And I think reflecting back on our dinner, I don't think he had a contingency plan because he had a multi-year contract, reportedly a $20 million a year contract.
[00:47:00.447 --> 00:47:02.508]  So whatever years he has
[00:47:02.808 --> 00:47:13.276]  Let's hope it's not golden handcuffs like Ventura.
[00:47:13.276 --> 00:47:18.140]  They signed him for five years or whatever and then fired him in a year and then he couldn't work for four.
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:21.283]  If I know Tucker, he'll just, if that's in there, he'll just give the money back.
[00:47:21.283 --> 00:47:26.187]  But without getting into it, and I had some other conversations with him, he knew he could be fired any time.
[00:47:26.187 --> 00:47:27.888]  And he was fighting with these producers.
[00:47:27.888 --> 00:47:28.709]  And he said he didn't care.
[00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:31.155]  And so he said, he said, I don't care.
[00:47:31.155 --> 00:47:32.660]  I'm not stopping no matter what.
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:34.325]  And that's what he told me at Thanksgiving.
[00:47:34.325 --> 00:47:35.188]  So I think we've seen that.
[00:47:36.823 --> 00:47:41.447]  Well, people weren't tuning in just because they liked his delivery style.
[00:47:41.447 --> 00:48:01.185]  They were tuning in because of the news that he constantly broke, because of his willingness to challenge the conventional wisdom narrative, because of his willingness to stand up, whether it was Big Pharma, whether it was January 6th, or whether it was the war, or whether it was Hunter Biden's laptop,
[00:48:01.585 --> 00:48:11.508]  Or whether, in my case, it was the outrageousness of the Mueller Witch Hunt, where they basically were pressuring me to lie against Donald Trump.
[00:48:11.508 --> 00:48:12.968]  I have to be very honest.
[00:48:12.968 --> 00:48:17.390]  If it were not for Tucker Carlson, would I even be alive today?
[00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:18.990]  Would I be here on this show today?
[00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.630]  No, absolutely.
[00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:26.012]  He championed you and championed... He's the only national show that played the clips of me trying to stop people going to the Capitol.
[00:48:26.012 --> 00:48:26.912]  They were trying to indict me.
[00:48:26.912 --> 00:48:29.073]  The Justice Department literally was trying to indict me.
[00:48:29.873 --> 00:48:31.814]  He's a very savvy guy, so I think that he's probably working on a
[00:48:58.283 --> 00:49:06.695]  Now, the only question in my mind is whether it is net-based, whether it is cable-based.
[00:49:06.695 --> 00:49:13.645]  By the way, I think it's very important to recognize that there's a major effort to do away with AM radio.
[00:49:14.565 --> 00:49:24.152]  Ford has announced, and Tesla has also announced, that there will not be AM radio receivers in their next generation of vehicles.
[00:49:24.152 --> 00:49:29.636]  And by the way, the AM receiver, for those people that don't know, cost them like $3 to put in the computer.
[00:49:29.636 --> 00:49:30.636]  I looked it up.
[00:49:30.636 --> 00:49:32.137]  It's literally nothing.
[00:49:32.137 --> 00:49:34.779]  It's a tiny little chip part.
[00:49:34.779 --> 00:49:41.704]  But AM radio is a vital, important asset in terms of alternative and conservative messaging.
[00:49:42.603 --> 00:49:47.909]  Conservative talk radio is still very, very powerful in this country.
[00:49:47.909 --> 00:49:56.960]  The emergency broadcast system is based in our AM radio networks, yet there's a concerted effort to do away from it.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.302]  Just like they want to get rid of cash, and this is key because...
[00:50:00.103 --> 00:50:02.805]  Old media didn't watch and listen to you.
[00:50:02.805 --> 00:50:04.686]  All the new media tracks what you do.
[00:50:04.686 --> 00:50:05.586]  It's two-way.
[00:50:05.586 --> 00:50:10.729]  So we need to keep broadcast TV and radio because you know next is going to be FM radio.
[00:50:10.729 --> 00:50:11.189]  Absolutely.
[00:50:11.189 --> 00:50:12.310]  We've got that.
[00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:20.414]  I think congressional law, you know, ought to basically say that it's baked into the cake that communications need to stay there.
[00:50:21.874 --> 00:50:25.015]  Well, and the emergency broadcast system justifies it.
[00:50:25.015 --> 00:50:30.276]  It's the most important way to get to all Americans.
[00:50:30.276 --> 00:50:39.159]  I mean, those who listen to AM radio, this is just a fact, they tend to be more middle and lower socioeconomic Americans.
[00:50:39.159 --> 00:50:42.220]  They're usually doing something else while they're listening to the radio.
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:44.600]  Mostly driving, but not completely.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:49.342]  And they don't want to have to have a phone, and a phone can break or cut out.
[00:50:49.342 --> 00:50:49.962]  Absolutely.
[00:50:50.282 --> 00:50:51.283]  There's a major move to do that.
[00:50:51.283 --> 00:50:56.789]  Roger, shifting gears in the time we have with you, what do you make of Biden's ridiculous re-announcement?
[00:50:56.789 --> 00:50:59.612]  What's happening with Paul Ryan, the budget, the debt ceiling?
[00:50:59.612 --> 00:51:05.719]  What do you think of Paul Ryan so far?
[00:51:05.719 --> 00:51:06.500]  Kevin McCarthy.
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:06.980]  Kevin McCarthy.
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:08.102]  I was back on Paul Ryan earlier.
[00:51:08.102 --> 00:51:08.522]  Sorry.
[00:51:08.522 --> 00:51:10.164]  Having a Freudian slip there.
[00:51:11.255 --> 00:51:25.695]  First of all, I think Kevin McCarthy, while I laud the fact that he gave all of the January 6th videos, or he made them available to Tucker, I still believe he needs to fulfill his campaign pledge, put them all up on a public access website.
[00:51:26.455 --> 00:51:39.225]  So the attorneys for those who are charged regarding January 6th can see them, so that journalists, all journalists can see them, so that all American citizens can see them and make their own judgments.
[00:51:39.225 --> 00:51:46.151]  That's what he committed to do, with no disrespect to Tucker Carlson at all, who I think produced some great
[00:51:46.591 --> 00:51:50.652]  Programming and some bombshell reports on that material.
[00:51:50.652 --> 00:51:53.813]  I suspect that there's more there that we need to see.
[00:51:53.813 --> 00:51:56.493]  As far as Joe Biden is concerned, Alex, I'm sorry.
[00:51:56.493 --> 00:51:58.054]  I'm still not convinced.
[00:51:58.054 --> 00:52:03.735]  I think that this announcement of this week means that he's a placeholder.
[00:52:03.735 --> 00:52:05.735]  So he announced his candidacy.
[00:52:05.735 --> 00:52:08.316]  I presume that he's filing with the Federal Election Commission.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:09.320]  Does he?
[00:52:25.712 --> 00:52:28.134]  So the big question is, and I totally agree, he can't even barely talk.
[00:52:28.134 --> 00:52:30.316]  He's way worse than ever.
[00:52:30.316 --> 00:52:31.237]  He's degenerating.
[00:52:31.237 --> 00:52:32.518]  His, you know, sell-by date was years ago.
[00:52:51.755 --> 00:52:53.297]  The expiration date is gone.
[00:52:53.297 --> 00:52:55.079]  Who are they planning to bring in?
[00:52:55.079 --> 00:52:56.821]  Is it Newsom?
[00:52:56.821 --> 00:52:59.944]  Is it, uh, is Hillary Crazy enough to try it again?
[00:52:59.944 --> 00:53:00.625]  Is it Big Mike?
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:04.602]  I think that it is Michelle Obama.
[00:53:04.602 --> 00:53:09.867]  I think Michelle Obama could raise $100 billion in two weeks.
[00:53:09.867 --> 00:53:13.190]  The convention is in Chicago, her hometown.
[00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:20.737]  South Carolina is a state where demographically African-American Democrats dominate the primary.
[00:53:20.737 --> 00:53:22.218]  It is the home state for grand
[00:53:22.318 --> 00:53:24.019]  Let me ask you a question, Roger.
[00:53:24.019 --> 00:53:29.062]  Here is Big Mike coming out of a building, a university, and what do you think is happening there?
[00:53:29.062 --> 00:53:31.404]  What is Big Mike adjusting, and what is bouncing around?
[00:53:53.495 --> 00:53:55.836]  I'm not going to speculate on that.
[00:53:55.836 --> 00:54:07.600]  I've had my good friend Joel Gilbert has an extraordinarily effective and very well done both book and documentary called Michelle Obama 2024.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:19.665]  And I think he makes a very compelling case about how she's in the midst of reinventing herself and how she changes up her diction and her hairstyle at campaign time.
[00:54:21.006 --> 00:54:26.831]  I think she'd be a very formidable candidate if she elects to run.
[00:54:26.831 --> 00:54:30.294]  She would not be carrying the baggage of Joe Biden.
[00:54:30.294 --> 00:54:33.917]  She's not responsible for record gasoline prices.
[00:54:33.917 --> 00:54:38.682]  She's not responsible for the- So you really think they're going to run Big Mike?
[00:54:40.024 --> 00:54:44.426]  I believe Michelle Obama will be the nominee of the Democratic Party.
[00:54:44.426 --> 00:54:55.251]  I've written it and spoken about it for some time, and anybody who thinks that that will be simple, and that she will be a non-formidable candidate, I think is kidding themselves.
[00:54:55.251 --> 00:55:01.234]  Now, they obviously have an issue in Vice President Kamala Harris.
[00:55:01.234 --> 00:55:07.317]  She would have to step aside, but her poll numbers are even worse than Joe Biden.
[00:55:08.217 --> 00:55:10.879]  And it's hard to say, she's even less articulate than Biden.
[00:55:10.879 --> 00:55:12.660]  I mean, what a group of morons.
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:15.942]  All right, Roger Stone, thank you so much for the time.
[00:55:15.942 --> 00:55:20.444]  StoneZone.com, you host your Frank Speech Show, 5 p.m., what is it, Eastern?
[00:55:20.444 --> 00:55:22.766]  And we really appreciate you.
[00:55:22.766 --> 00:55:25.607]  5 o'clock Eastern, go to StoneZone.live.
[00:55:25.607 --> 00:55:27.989]  StoneZone.live, 5 o'clock today.
[00:55:27.989 --> 00:55:29.089]  Many thanks, Alex.
[00:55:29.089 --> 00:55:30.290]  Thank you, brother.
[00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:31.191]  All right, there goes Roger.
[00:55:31.191 --> 00:55:32.231]  I agree with basically everything he said.
[00:55:32.231 --> 00:55:32.972]  What a smart guy.
[00:55:32.972 --> 00:55:34.993]  All right, we're going to start the next hour.
[00:55:36.428 --> 00:55:40.829]  That shift out of the Tucker Carlson stuff is very important.
[00:55:40.829 --> 00:55:42.789]  Into the government running child kidnapping rings.
[00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:45.090]  It's mainstream news!
[00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:46.570]  Incredible!
[00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:52.431]  And... feeding babies insects to save them.
[00:55:52.431 --> 00:55:55.532]  Food writer cuts her grocery bill in half by feeding her baby crickets.
[00:55:55.532 --> 00:55:56.772]  How abusive is that?
[00:55:56.772 --> 00:55:59.653]  Not as if they're gross.
[00:55:59.653 --> 00:56:04.514]  The chitin shells of bugs are highly carcinogenic and we're not supposed to eat.
[00:56:05.509 --> 00:56:08.913]  Hard-shelled insects, which is most insects.
[00:56:08.913 --> 00:56:11.276]  It's a toxic fact.
[00:56:11.276 --> 00:56:11.817]  Look it up.
[00:56:11.817 --> 00:56:19.506]  Chitin, not just linked to cancer, extremely carcinogenic causes all sorts of joint pain and all sorts of arthritis.
[00:56:19.506 --> 00:56:20.987]  I mean, it is crazy.
[00:56:21.843 --> 00:56:25.125]  But leftists don't just chop their kids' wee-wees off and their breasts off.
[00:56:25.125 --> 00:56:27.226]  Now they feed them toxic bugs.
[00:56:27.226 --> 00:56:29.187]  What a nice mommy.
[00:56:29.187 --> 00:56:32.169]  What a sweet mommy.
[00:56:32.169 --> 00:56:33.610]  And it gets worse.
[00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:34.830]  Specter of Soylent Green.
[00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:35.911]  That's Yahoo News.
[00:56:35.911 --> 00:56:37.292]  Feeding us dead people.
[00:56:37.292 --> 00:56:37.972]  It's liberal.
[00:56:37.972 --> 00:56:39.853]  20 states have passed laws to do it.
[00:56:39.853 --> 00:56:40.934]  You think I'm joking?
[00:56:42.239 --> 00:56:43.059]  I'm not!
[00:56:43.059 --> 00:56:44.920]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:46.580]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.

[00:57:35.615 --> 00:57:43.427]  We have the very highest quality CBD oil at InfoWarsTore.com at over, on average, half of what leading competitors sell high quality CBD for.
[00:57:43.427 --> 00:57:45.070]  All at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:46.371]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[00:57:49.673 --> 00:57:54.675]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[00:57:54.675 --> 00:57:56.855]  We made it even stronger.
[00:57:56.855 --> 00:58:00.596]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:58:00.596 --> 00:58:06.798]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:58:06.798 --> 00:58:13.560]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:14.981]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:58:15.661 --> 00:58:28.733]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:58:28.733 --> 00:58:30.735]  It is the super fuel.
[00:58:30.735 --> 00:58:32.196]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:58:32.196 --> 00:58:33.057]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[00:58:33.057 --> 00:58:34.018]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:58:34.018 --> 00:58:35.199]  They go good with this.
[00:58:35.199 --> 00:58:37.241]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:58:37.958 --> 00:58:39.439]  This is the Boss.
[00:58:39.439 --> 00:58:40.179]  TurboForce.
[00:58:40.179 --> 00:58:41.199]  Back in stock.

[00:58:50.262 --> 00:59:02.226]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfowarStore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[00:59:02.226 --> 00:59:06.568]  I am humbly, hand-in-hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in,
[00:59:07.128 --> 00:59:10.573]  Many of you for years have never gone to Infowarshaw.com.
[00:59:10.573 --> 00:59:19.386]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to Infowarshaw.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.

[00:59:23.792 --> 00:59:25.313]  But we need funds to operate.

[00:59:33.676 --> 00:59:36.637]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air.

[00:59:52.910 --> 01:00:15.437]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:15.437 --> 01:00:18.498]  Boy, we got a big hour two, three, and four.
[01:00:18.498 --> 01:00:21.279]  I'm hosting the rest of the broadcast, all four hours today.
[01:00:23.072 --> 01:00:29.015]  Coming up in one hour, Robert Chapman, one of the original patriots battling the new world order, everything he said came true.
[01:00:29.015 --> 01:00:32.096]  He'll be joining us for at least an hour and a half or so.
[01:00:32.096 --> 01:00:34.797]  That is coming up today.
[01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:37.579]  Let's play a few clips of Mr. Chapman.
[01:00:37.579 --> 01:00:41.820]  There's so many we'll be getting to when he's on with us from congressional hearings.
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:43.201]  Robert Fletcher.
[01:00:43.201 --> 01:00:45.402]  I'm all over the map here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:45.402 --> 01:00:46.803]  Thinking about all these other people.
[01:00:46.803 --> 01:00:47.243]  Here's a clip.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:01:08.944]  Well, Fletcher, perhaps your time might be used to specify some of the comments which you made this morning on Good Morning America, ABC, if you would, about a second bomb being planted at Oklahoma City or evidence of a second assailant, a second conspiracy.
[01:01:08.944 --> 01:01:09.964]  Well, yes.
[01:01:09.964 --> 01:01:17.106]  Typically, what I might do, again, is a matter of so we can cover enough things that will also be important.
[01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:21.448]  This is a report that's been put together by a couple of people.
[01:01:21.448 --> 01:01:29.070]  One of them is a former FBI agent, formerly with a $22 million budget and 700 people working under him.
[01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:34.032]  He had been with the FBI for some, probably 25 years.
[01:01:34.032 --> 01:01:43.055]  His determination, along with many experts, is that there was a minimum of at least one, if not two, more explosions simultaneously within the building.
[01:01:43.055 --> 01:01:45.956]  Additionally, we have information that John Doe No.
[01:01:45.956 --> 01:01:46.836]  2 has been located.
[01:01:47.536 --> 01:01:57.739]  He has a name, we know who he is, where he is, and that he is also of a foreign descent, and for some reason the FBI is steering away from this gentleman.
[01:01:57.739 --> 01:02:04.781]  That needs to be looked into more definitively, and I would offer this report, which I will leave with you folks.
[01:02:04.781 --> 01:02:09.902]  This also covers the type of bomb that most likely was utilized inside the building.
[01:02:10.642 --> 01:02:21.004]  The idea that it was a huge fertilizer bomb, there was no residue to speak of, no caustic fumes which automatically would come from that bomb if it was singularly placed.
[01:02:21.004 --> 01:02:30.686]  Additionally, the idea, according to experts, is the idea of that bomb directly destroying the building as it did is absolute baloney.
[01:02:30.686 --> 01:02:36.668]  So I'll just leave this and then we can get into, again, the answers and questions relative to
[01:02:38.208 --> 01:02:43.792]  Other events of government corruption and being out of control, I do want to leave as much time as we can on that.
[01:02:43.792 --> 01:02:57.880]  Which includes the militarization of local police offices all over the United States, including the supplying of armored personnel vehicles all over America to smaller police stations, which is ridiculous.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.041]  I'd like to pass my time.
[01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:00.422]  Thank you, Mr. Flutter.
[01:03:00.422 --> 01:03:06.565]  Mr. Flutter, another question on the interview with the Los Angeles Times on April 21st.
[01:03:06.565 --> 01:03:07.226]  You said that the
[01:03:08.308 --> 01:03:21.993]  You told the Associated Press that the American government has created weather tampering techniques so that the New World Order will be able to starve millions of Americans and to control the rest.
[01:03:23.561 --> 01:03:25.842]  Would you explain what you were trying to say?
[01:03:25.842 --> 01:03:29.464]  Well, what I was trying to say is exactly what I said.
[01:03:29.464 --> 01:03:31.765]  There is weather control techniques.
[01:03:31.765 --> 01:03:38.488]  We have a complete package on that, which I did not bring, but I certainly will see to it that it is brought in for the record.
[01:03:38.488 --> 01:03:41.609]  Number one, the entire patents on the equipment.
[01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:51.693]  Number two, Senator Claiborne Pell's complete statement and story of his own, that not only does it exist, but that we even utilized it as far back as the Vietnam War.
[01:03:51.693 --> 01:03:52.974]  You might want to touch base with Senator Pell.
[01:03:53.594 --> 01:03:58.038]  I just want to repeat before I turn to questions.
[01:03:58.038 --> 01:04:08.308]  You're saying the government has created weather tampering techniques so that the quote new world order will be able to starve millions of Americans worldwide.
[01:04:09.187 --> 01:04:11.968]  Millions of Americans and to control the rest.
[01:04:28.274 --> 01:04:29.154]  We're good to go.
[01:04:51.368 --> 01:04:55.820]  That they are the greatest weapon ever created in the world, and that's the Senator's own statement.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.524]  So yes, I do stand on that.
[01:04:57.524 --> 01:04:58.266]  Thank you, Mr. Fletcher.
[01:04:58.266 --> 01:04:58.848]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[01:04:59.955 --> 01:05:05.936]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the Globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:05:05.936 --> 01:05:08.597]  People said, no way, he's the most popular thing that ever happened.
[01:05:08.597 --> 01:05:10.778]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:05:10.778 --> 01:05:13.358]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:05:13.358 --> 01:05:16.579]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:18.360]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:24.961]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:05:24.961 --> 01:05:27.762]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:05:28.737 --> 01:05:28.937]  I think?
[01:06:11.508 --> 01:06:15.931]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:15.931 --> 01:06:21.176]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:21.176 --> 01:06:24.919]  The propaganda, the lies, the deception is everywhere.
[01:06:26.551 --> 01:06:34.635]  I'm going to blitz through massively important news on dozens of subjects until the bottom of the hour.
[01:06:34.635 --> 01:06:36.977]  Then I'm only going to take seven calls or so.
[01:06:36.977 --> 01:06:44.741]  We'll open the phones up for that 30 minutes on Tucker Carlson's firing and where you think this is going and what it signifies for censorship.
[01:06:44.741 --> 01:06:47.562]  Then Bob Fletcher will be on with us for two hours.
[01:06:47.562 --> 01:06:51.505]  He'll be on with us for one hour, talking about the history of the New World Order and where it's going.
[01:06:51.505 --> 01:06:53.926]  A true trailblazer, completely vindicated, on target.
[01:06:55.168 --> 01:06:57.471]  Then, in the fourth hour, I'm going to host with him.
[01:06:57.471 --> 01:06:59.974]  We will take your calls at that point.
[01:06:59.974 --> 01:07:03.157]  But we'll open the phones up, get about seven calls to the board.
[01:07:03.157 --> 01:07:08.023]  We'll get all seven of those calls or so in two segments at the bottom of the hour.
[01:07:08.023 --> 01:07:11.066]  And then, Bob Fletcher is coming on.
[01:07:11.066 --> 01:07:13.128]  Absolutely incredible information.
[01:07:13.128 --> 01:07:13.409]  Okay.
[01:07:18.615 --> 01:07:23.317]  The left is being told it's a liberal sacrament to feed bugs to children, to babies.
[01:07:23.317 --> 01:07:31.440]  Instead of giving them their own milk, or protein from a cow, or a goat, or a donkey, the best, they say, the only thing that rivals a human, for our own babies.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:36.983]  No, give them bug protein, which is chitin, and is extremely toxic.
[01:07:36.983 --> 01:07:44.186]  We're gonna go over all that, coming up, also, Spectre of Soylent Green, Yahoo News, 20 plus states have passed laws to feed you dead people.
[01:07:44.186 --> 01:07:45.066]  Can't make that up.
[01:07:45.066 --> 01:07:47.487]  This is, this is, this is all going down.
[01:07:49.056 --> 01:07:57.581]  But, I asked the crew about 20 minutes ago, I said, hey, they had closing arguments yesterday in the Proud Boys show trial in D.C.
[01:07:57.581 --> 01:08:04.304]  If they set the precedent with these guys like they've done with the Oath Keepers, they're coming after everybody.
[01:08:04.304 --> 01:08:08.366]  And I said, please, let me know how jury deliberations are going.
[01:08:08.366 --> 01:08:13.529]  So, about 10 minutes ago, they walk in and they hand me this CBS News article.
[01:08:13.529 --> 01:08:15.050]  I start to read it during the last break.
[01:08:17.998 --> 01:08:23.863]  And I only had time to read the first page because it's a lot of paragraphs here.
[01:08:23.863 --> 01:08:25.884]  It's two and a half pages long.
[01:08:25.884 --> 01:08:31.308]  In the first page, I found three gigantic lies.
[01:08:31.308 --> 01:08:44.419]  And what's incredible is, it's like the New York Times last week got caught saying that Edward Snowden gave his material to Wikileaks.
[01:08:44.419 --> 01:08:46.100]  Everybody knows he didn't do that.
[01:08:47.381 --> 01:08:48.522]  WikiLeaks had nothing to do with it.
[01:08:48.522 --> 01:08:50.624]  They said, we don't care, we're just gonna lie.
[01:08:50.624 --> 01:09:03.834]  So, they're flooding the zone, not by accident, by design, not with just big official lies, but just weird disinfo everywhere.
[01:09:03.834 --> 01:09:05.936]  So, here's what they put in here.
[01:09:05.936 --> 01:09:07.517]  Here's just one of the lies.
[01:09:07.517 --> 01:09:14.562]  Jury in Proud Boys Sedition Conspiracy January 6th Case to Begin Deliberations Wednesday.
[01:09:14.562 --> 01:09:16.224]  And it just, here's just one of the lies.
[01:09:17.469 --> 01:09:20.830]  Well they're not just lying about what's going on on January 6th or what happened at the trial.
[01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:28.813]  They just put out something that sounds true but isn't to make it sound like InfoWars is on trial.
[01:09:28.813 --> 01:09:37.457]  And in a somewhat rambling closing argument of his own, InfoWars defense attorney and legal representative for Joseph Biggs alleged.
[01:09:37.457 --> 01:09:41.738]  So they put it out there like InfoWars is on trial.
[01:09:41.738 --> 01:09:45.600]  Yes it's true Norm Pettis has done some work for us but the idea that he's now
[01:09:46.681 --> 01:09:48.342]  It'd be like if somebody had represented O.J.
[01:09:48.342 --> 01:09:49.443]  Simpson, they went, O.J.
[01:09:49.443 --> 01:09:54.806]  Simpson, defense attorney, it's again, to demonize him for worse.
[01:09:54.806 --> 01:09:57.588]  It's just everywhere.
[01:09:57.588 --> 01:10:07.674]  And Norm goes on, the facts of this case are that Donald Trump was compelling into using the Proud Boys as a prop, prompting objections from the Justice Department and the court.
[01:10:07.674 --> 01:10:09.355]  WUSA reported.
[01:10:09.355 --> 01:10:11.756]  Yeah, now the closing arguments are over.
[01:10:11.756 --> 01:10:13.277]  I still don't get Norm on.
[01:10:13.277 --> 01:10:14.018]  I don't agree with Norm.
[01:10:14.741 --> 01:10:16.762]  People say, well, if you have a lawyer, you must agree with everything they believe.
[01:10:16.762 --> 01:10:25.104]  No, I don't agree with Norm that Trump used the Proud Boys as a prop.
[01:10:25.104 --> 01:10:28.965]  The Proud Boys existed before Trump got elected.
[01:10:28.965 --> 01:10:30.766]  Gavin McGinnis created it.
[01:10:30.766 --> 01:10:38.348]  So, and the Proud Boys, most of them didn't even go in the Capitol.
[01:10:38.348 --> 01:10:38.748]  So again,
[01:10:41.929 --> 01:10:49.093]  In my view, and I haven't talked to Norm yet, that is an attempt by a defense attorney to say, oh, it's all Donald Trump's fault.
[01:10:49.093 --> 01:10:57.338]  But your clients didn't do anything.
[01:10:57.338 --> 01:10:59.019]  So again, why go with that debate?
[01:10:59.019 --> 01:11:00.420]  And I'm not attacking Norm.
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:03.582]  It's just, I don't agree with it.
[01:11:03.582 --> 01:11:07.904]  I don't agree with that strategy.
[01:11:07.904 --> 01:11:09.345]  But that's just where we are.
[01:11:09.345 --> 01:11:10.486]  So pray for the proud boys.
[01:11:11.556 --> 01:11:16.358]  And pray for justice, but 93% of people in DC vote Democrat.
[01:11:16.358 --> 01:11:19.019]  They've all, most of them got government jobs.
[01:11:19.019 --> 01:11:26.762]  And the little secret is you convict Republicans, you get pay raises, you get bonuses, you get pats on the back.
[01:11:26.762 --> 01:11:30.223]  In New York, it's something like 80% vote Democrat.
[01:11:30.223 --> 01:11:36.626]  So how is Trump supposed to get a fair trial in New York City?
[01:11:38.837 --> 01:11:40.498]  And the answer is no.
[01:11:40.498 --> 01:11:42.540]  But that's how they win by lawfare.
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:44.962]  They control these jurisdictions.
[01:11:44.962 --> 01:11:51.347]  They have populations that would send an innocent man to the electric chair if they were told to.
[01:11:51.347 --> 01:11:53.309]  And it's a real problem.
[01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:58.593]  And you got Soros prosecutors, not just in those jurisdictions, but basically everywhere now.
[01:11:58.593 --> 01:12:01.596]  And this is how they're conquering America and taking our country over.
[01:12:01.596 --> 01:12:02.897]  Now let's shift gears into this.
[01:12:06.564 --> 01:12:09.067]  The FDA has released a press release.
[01:12:09.067 --> 01:12:10.710]  I guess they're God.
[01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:14.314]  Congress hasn't passed laws, the FDA just did.
[01:12:14.314 --> 01:12:15.316]  That's what the CDC said.
[01:12:15.316 --> 01:12:16.197]  All rents are forgiven.
[01:12:16.197 --> 01:12:18.420]  And the Supreme Court had to say, you can't do that.
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:19.261]  That's not a law.
[01:12:19.261 --> 01:12:19.942]  You don't make law.
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:31.462]  Leave the Supreme Court to reign this in fast, because the FDA is a revolving panel of big pharma executives, mainly, quote, vaccine execs.
[01:12:31.462 --> 01:12:34.442]  But we pointed out the mRNA shot is not a vaccine.
[01:12:34.442 --> 01:12:35.782]  We pointed out it doesn't protect you.
[01:12:35.782 --> 01:12:36.703]  It lowers your immune system.
[01:12:36.703 --> 01:12:39.363]  It's a total fraud.
[01:12:39.363 --> 01:12:41.343]  And it did not go through a regular approval process.
[01:12:41.343 --> 01:12:42.864]  They gave it emergency authorization.
[01:12:42.864 --> 01:12:46.164]  The really bad thing Trump did.
[01:12:46.164 --> 01:12:47.644]  But look at this headline.
[01:12:47.644 --> 01:12:51.205]  FDA vaccines don't have to prevent infection or transmission.
[01:12:52.338 --> 01:12:56.341]  Let that roll off the tongue and then roll through your brain.
[01:12:56.341 --> 01:13:01.064]  Vaccines don't have to prevent infection or transmission.
[01:13:01.064 --> 01:13:03.466]  Let me say it again.
[01:13:03.466 --> 01:13:10.671]  Vaccines don't have to prevent infection or transmission.
[01:13:10.671 --> 01:13:12.913]  Well, then what do they do?
[01:13:12.913 --> 01:13:15.375]  Oh, they lessen the illness or make you not die.
[01:13:15.375 --> 01:13:21.139]  All the statistics around the world from the insurance companies is you're way more likely to die if you take it or get sick.
[01:13:22.318 --> 01:13:23.099]  Everybody knows that.
[01:13:23.099 --> 01:13:25.801]  Well, I've had five shots and I've got my seventh case of COVID.
[01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:30.584]  Meanwhile, if you have natural immunity, you don't get it again.
[01:13:30.584 --> 01:13:34.327]  But remember Fauci basically said natural immunity doesn't exist.
[01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:37.629]  He's also come out with a new Whopper liable play next segment.
[01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:40.772]  He says he actually was never for lockdowns and never for closing schools.
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:49.043]  We have like a 10-minute compilation of him saying, keep things locked down, but we're just going to play a few clips of him doing it.
[01:13:49.043 --> 01:13:52.024]  But I mean, I never wanted to lock you down.
[01:13:52.024 --> 01:13:53.444]  I was never for locking schools.
[01:13:53.444 --> 01:13:55.485]  I was never for masks.
[01:13:55.485 --> 01:13:57.546]  And Santa Claus doesn't wear a red suit.
[01:13:57.546 --> 01:14:00.027]  And neither does old Scratch.
[01:14:00.027 --> 01:14:04.049]  So, you read this article, and it is a whopper.
[01:14:04.049 --> 01:14:06.209]  And it's AP, Reuters, everywhere.
[01:14:06.209 --> 01:14:07.390]  Excerpt 7 at Zero Hedge.
[01:14:08.973 --> 01:14:13.016]  Vaccines are traditionally known as drugs that prevent an illness.
[01:14:13.016 --> 01:14:15.037]  No, they teach your body immunity.
[01:14:15.037 --> 01:14:15.417]  The U.S.
[01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:26.004]  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, for years said a vaccine is a product that produces immunity with vaccination and an injection of an infectious organism in order to prevent the disease.
[01:14:26.004 --> 01:14:31.748]  The agency changed its definitions after people correctly noted that COVID-19 vaccines do not prevent infection.
[01:14:33.399 --> 01:14:48.904]  I've officially come out as policy, so they can say, like, a goat is a walrus, or a killer whale is a turkey, or an Easter Bunny is a leprechaun, or two men can have a baby, or women are getting pregnant in prison from other women.
[01:14:48.904 --> 01:14:50.645]  No, it's men in the prison.
[01:14:50.645 --> 01:14:52.425]  I mean, it's a murder of logic.
[01:14:52.425 --> 01:14:53.625]  It's ridiculous.
[01:14:53.625 --> 01:14:58.267]  But tyranny is ridiculous, so that's why they have to murder logic and normalize this idiocy.
[01:15:00.714 --> 01:15:09.738]  The coalition, the coalition advocating for adequately labeled medicines, a group of experts, had called the FDA to make clear that COVID-19 vaccines don't prevent infection or transmission.
[01:15:09.738 --> 01:15:15.881]  And now they put out an announcement saying, indeed they don't.
[01:15:15.881 --> 01:15:20.544]  But in the ads, they tell you they do protect you.
[01:15:21.471 --> 01:15:31.536]  Including unapproved ads when it wasn't approved for under five to children on Sesame Street and Nickelodeon and everywhere else.
[01:15:31.536 --> 01:15:33.337]  I mean, these people are sick.
[01:15:33.337 --> 01:15:34.397]  They're criminal.
[01:15:34.397 --> 01:15:37.019]  They're committing all these crimes in our face.
[01:15:37.019 --> 01:15:37.719]  It is ridiculous.
[01:15:37.719 --> 01:15:39.280]  I'll play the Thoughts and Glimpses when we come back.
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:46.703]  And then, told you on Monday, big whistleblowers coming out to Congress on giant child kidnapping rings.
[01:15:46.703 --> 01:15:48.064]  Fox News today.
[01:15:52.136 --> 01:15:54.196]  And we'll make sure you get all of it.
[01:15:54.196 --> 01:15:59.177]  We're going to break it all down coming up.
[01:15:59.177 --> 01:16:04.198]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[01:16:04.198 --> 01:16:06.359]  We made it even stronger.
[01:16:06.359 --> 01:16:10.099]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:16:10.099 --> 01:16:14.320]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.040]  It's not just
[01:16:18.341 --> 01:16:23.402]  Wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[01:16:23.402 --> 01:16:25.162]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:16:25.162 --> 01:16:38.245]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[01:16:38.245 --> 01:16:40.225]  It is the super fuel.
[01:16:40.225 --> 01:16:41.705]  RainForce Plus is great.
[01:16:41.705 --> 01:16:42.565]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[01:16:42.565 --> 01:16:43.525]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:16:43.525 --> 01:16:44.706]  They go good with this.
[01:16:44.706 --> 01:16:46.726]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:16:47.763 --> 01:17:03.367]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:17:03.367 --> 01:17:05.648]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:17:05.648 --> 01:17:09.569]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:17:09.569 --> 01:17:13.510]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:17:14.949 --> 01:17:18.496]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:17:18.496 --> 01:17:25.409]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[01:17:25.409 --> 01:17:26.311]  It's really just incredible.
[01:17:27.313 --> 01:17:30.975]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:17:30.975 --> 01:17:36.758]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:17:36.758 --> 01:17:39.779]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:17:39.779 --> 01:17:46.843]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:17:46.843 --> 01:17:48.024]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:17:48.724 --> 01:17:53.027]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:17:53.027 --> 01:17:57.970]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsaw.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:17:57.970 --> 01:17:59.131]  Please take action now.
[01:17:59.131 --> 01:18:05.795]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:18:05.795 --> 01:18:07.716]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:09.237]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[01:18:09.237 --> 01:18:12.019]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:18:12.019 --> 01:18:14.041]  And it says, political prisoner.
[01:18:14.821 --> 01:18:16.783]  With an image of President Trump.
[01:18:16.783 --> 01:18:19.225]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:18:19.225 --> 01:18:21.366]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:18:21.366 --> 01:18:26.751]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[01:18:26.751 --> 01:18:27.952]  Jail background.
[01:18:27.952 --> 01:18:29.013]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:18:29.013 --> 01:18:33.136]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:18:33.136 --> 01:18:34.738]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[01:18:34.738 --> 01:18:35.758]  No, I'm not running for President.
[01:18:35.758 --> 01:18:38.320]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.101]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:18:39.101 --> 01:18:39.962]  Alex Jones for President.
[01:18:40.642 --> 01:18:43.504]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[01:18:43.504 --> 01:18:45.385]  Great way to fund the operation.
[01:18:45.385 --> 01:18:54.631]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:18:54.631 --> 01:18:57.092]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[01:19:06.997 --> 01:19:08.318]  I want you all to know something.
[01:19:08.318 --> 01:19:10.279]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:19:10.279 --> 01:19:13.820]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:16.762]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:19:16.762 --> 01:19:21.184]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[01:19:21.184 --> 01:19:23.405]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:19:23.405 --> 01:19:26.947]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:19:26.947 --> 01:19:30.389]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:33.531]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[01:19:33.531 --> 01:19:34.552]  Years ago.
[01:19:34.552 --> 01:19:38.615]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[01:19:38.615 --> 01:19:41.157]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:19:41.157 --> 01:19:43.618]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:19:43.618 --> 01:19:46.741]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:19:46.741 --> 01:19:51.384]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:19:59.767 --> 01:20:05.688]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:20:22.516 --> 01:20:25.218]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:25.218 --> 01:20:30.541]  So here's Fauci doing damage control yesterday.
[01:20:30.541 --> 01:20:33.243]  He's been making the rounds.
[01:20:33.243 --> 01:20:35.844]  This is just one of the clips.
[01:20:35.844 --> 01:20:36.465]  He was never
[01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:54.951]  We're keeping schools closed.
[01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:57.793]  He was never for lockdowns.
[01:20:57.793 --> 01:21:01.535]  And we have a clip of him saying that he basically was the main driver of that.
[01:21:01.535 --> 01:21:03.996]  So let's play the clips back to back.
[01:21:03.996 --> 01:21:07.899]  The real issue is how long do you keep that shut down?
[01:21:07.899 --> 01:21:10.500]  How long do you keep the schools closed?
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:22.968]  And if you recall and go back on many of the things I've said in a lot of interviews is that we've got to do whatever we can to get the schools open and get them open safe and keep them open.
[01:21:23.148 --> 01:21:30.654]  And I've said that many, many times, but the initial decision early on in the middle of that crisis, I believe, was the right decision.
[01:21:30.654 --> 01:21:35.878]  How long you kept them closed really varied depending upon the locale.
[01:21:35.878 --> 01:21:48.488]  The point that I made in my response to the reporter in the New York Times article was that what it is is that there was a personification of me as a person who essentially closed everything down.
[01:21:48.488 --> 01:21:50.430]  Those were public health recommendations.
[01:21:51.030 --> 01:22:00.334]  That came from the CDC, and I have always been very supportive of the CDC, because they base their recommendations purely on public health issues.
[01:22:00.334 --> 01:22:08.537]  And the point that I made, that as public health officials, it's our responsibility to give the public health perspective to it.
[01:22:08.537 --> 01:22:14.720]  The decision of how that balances with other considerations, really comes from other authorities.
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.441]  Yeah, I always pass the blame to somebody else.
[01:22:17.441 --> 01:22:18.903]  So there he is, double speaking.
[01:22:18.903 --> 01:22:21.304]  I was against the lockdowns, but I was for the lockdowns.
[01:22:21.304 --> 01:22:27.549]  Does everybody want me to play a compilation of him saying, keep the lockdowns in place in the schools?
[01:22:27.549 --> 01:22:28.770]  No, we have other stuff to cover.
[01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:31.572]  We'll put it in post once this live show is archived.
[01:22:31.572 --> 01:22:32.713]  Demand our video.
[01:22:32.713 --> 01:22:34.975]  But just getting back to this.
[01:22:34.975 --> 01:22:39.238]  FDA, vaccines don't have to prevent infection or transmission.
[01:22:39.238 --> 01:22:43.201]  CDC director admits vaccinated individuals can transmit COVID to others.
[01:22:44.206 --> 01:22:46.926]  And it goes on from there.
[01:22:46.926 --> 01:22:51.447]  Experts want labels for Pfizer Moderna COVID-19 vaccines updated to acknowledge limitations.
[01:22:51.447 --> 01:22:52.807]  They're not limitations.
[01:22:52.807 --> 01:22:54.808]  They don't work.
[01:22:54.808 --> 01:22:59.249]  Email confirms why CDC changed definitions of vaccine.
[01:22:59.249 --> 01:23:02.029]  It's to any drug they want to give you that doesn't even work.
[01:23:02.029 --> 01:23:04.169]  Okay.
[01:23:04.169 --> 01:23:06.350]  Let's shift gears into this.
[01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:11.011]  Everybody knows Biden, when he was a candidate, said, immediately surged the border if I got elected.
[01:23:11.011 --> 01:23:11.771]  I played it probably 500 times.
[01:23:11.771 --> 01:23:12.891]  I'm not going to play it again.
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:16.701]  Immediately surge the border, get back elected.
[01:23:16.701 --> 01:23:27.684]  Then he has Mayoris get up, whatever the hell his name is, and Mayorkas, and tell everybody that the border is secure.
[01:23:27.684 --> 01:23:30.225]  We played that clip last week.
[01:23:30.225 --> 01:23:31.465]  We've been out on the border a lot.
[01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:33.626]  We've already talked to whistleblower agents.
[01:23:33.626 --> 01:23:38.207]  We've already talked to the spokespersons and all of it.
[01:23:38.207 --> 01:23:40.108]  You know what's going on.
[01:23:40.108 --> 01:23:40.968]  But the level
[01:23:42.296 --> 01:23:47.319]  of the child trafficking and the convicted pedophiles being released is over the top.
[01:23:47.319 --> 01:24:00.386]  And the fact that the Democratic Party is literally getting donations from the smugglers and the people that are involved making money off of it, not just with the immigration lawyers that get all the George Soros and State Department funding, but at so many other levels.
[01:24:00.386 --> 01:24:05.309]  So now, Fox News reports whistleblower to tell House that U.S.
[01:24:05.309 --> 01:24:06.910]  government is middleman
[01:24:08.183 --> 01:24:18.470]  In multi-million dollar migrant child trafficking operation whistleblower on child migrant trafficking comes as Biden administration faces scrutiny over handling of forced labor.
[01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:23.033]  A House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday this is happening now and it's more next week I'm told
[01:24:24.264 --> 01:24:28.166]  We'll feature the testimony from a whistleblower who will warn lawmakers that the U.S.
[01:24:28.166 --> 01:24:34.050]  has become the middleman of a multi-billion dollar migrant child trafficking operation at the U.S.
[01:24:34.050 --> 01:24:40.574]  border that includes children being used for slave labor and as sex slaves.
[01:24:40.574 --> 01:24:46.677]  And that tens of thousands of convicted pedophiles have been released.
[01:24:46.677 --> 01:24:49.239]  They catch them again and they let them go.
[01:24:50.979 --> 01:24:56.900]  Or they charge them with a misdemeanor for illegally crossing the border and let them out in two weeks.
[01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:57.921]  This is the reality.
[01:24:57.921 --> 01:24:59.581]  And then you've got this legislation.
[01:24:59.581 --> 01:25:00.421]  This is not a joke.
[01:25:00.421 --> 01:25:02.342]  I know this doesn't sound real.
[01:25:02.342 --> 01:25:07.863]  Democrats float bills to allow LGBTQ plus migrants to walk into the U.S.
[01:25:07.863 --> 01:25:08.763]  unrestricted.
[01:25:08.763 --> 01:25:14.584]  And if you identify as LGBTQTQRZXYZ59382X794, Cubelet, Giblet, Schniblet, Piblet,
[01:25:18.872 --> 01:25:24.137]  That whatever gibberish it is, that you just are legally legalized.
[01:25:24.137 --> 01:25:26.379]  You're just absolutely, no one can stop you.
[01:25:26.379 --> 01:25:28.621]  I'm LGBTQXYZ.
[01:25:28.621 --> 01:25:31.824]  It's over.
[01:25:31.824 --> 01:25:34.787]  I mean, that's the reality.
[01:25:34.787 --> 01:25:39.271]  So if you're MS-13, you just say, I'm a trans person or I'm gay.
[01:25:39.271 --> 01:25:40.912]  Well, that's all you got to do.
[01:25:40.912 --> 01:25:41.673]  It's magic.
[01:25:41.673 --> 01:25:43.375]  Like a man saying, I'm really a woman.
[01:25:44.403 --> 01:25:52.954]  All these convicted pedophiles and murderers and rapists in the UK, in Europe, in the U.S., in Canada, raping women, getting them pregnant.
[01:25:52.954 --> 01:25:56.939]  And they keep doing it because it's a murder of logic.
[01:25:56.939 --> 01:26:02.806]  Steve Watson, articleinfowars.com, Democrats float bill to allow LGBTQ migrants to walk in the U.S.
[01:26:02.806 --> 01:26:03.287]  unrestricted.
[01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:11.076]  Democrats in the House and Senate have floated legislation, it's been introduced, that will allow undocumented migrants to effectively walk into the U.S.
[01:26:11.076 --> 01:26:19.764]  unrestricted, then declare their LGBTQ+, promoting border officials to warn that suddenly everyone is going to be LGBTQ.
[01:26:19.764 --> 01:26:21.125]  That's the plan.
[01:26:23.243 --> 01:26:23.763]  Video.
[01:26:23.763 --> 01:26:24.464]  I'm not going to play it.
[01:26:24.464 --> 01:26:26.065]  I'm just sick of hearing these people.
[01:26:26.065 --> 01:26:27.826]  But you can watch it at 4Wars.com.
[01:26:27.826 --> 01:26:33.751]  Biden's press secretary celebrates herself as being a queer lesbian and talks about how persecuted she is.
[01:26:33.751 --> 01:26:35.732]  Give me a break.
[01:26:35.732 --> 01:26:36.793]  It's a gang, folks.
[01:26:36.793 --> 01:26:39.255]  It has nothing to do with what they're doing with their wheelies.
[01:26:39.255 --> 01:26:41.577]  It's all about, we're in this group.
[01:26:41.577 --> 01:26:42.417]  We're victims.
[01:26:42.417 --> 01:26:44.839]  We get special treatment.
[01:26:44.839 --> 01:26:46.300]  We can run your life.
[01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:52.085]  You have to bow down to us and give us access to your children.
[01:26:52.085 --> 01:26:52.505]  That's it.
[01:26:54.264 --> 01:26:55.925]  Period.
[01:26:55.925 --> 01:26:59.307]  Now, this news.
[01:26:59.307 --> 01:27:03.550]  Well, first off, I told you on the Tucker Carlson issue.
[01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:05.471]  I know you're chomping at the bit to comment on that.
[01:27:05.471 --> 01:27:07.733]  We're going to open the phones right now.
[01:27:07.733 --> 01:27:10.855]  And the next two segments, the next 30 minutes, I'll take seven or eight calls maximum.
[01:27:12.503 --> 01:27:13.563]  That way nobody sits on hold.
[01:27:13.563 --> 01:27:22.565]  Then after Bob Fletcher is on for an hour, in the next hour, the fourth hour with him, after he's on for an hour, we will take calls for Robert Fletcher.
[01:27:22.565 --> 01:27:23.985]  So, look forward to that.
[01:27:23.985 --> 01:27:25.726]  This guy has not been in the media for years.
[01:27:25.726 --> 01:27:28.386]  He's an icon, a great patriot, dead on.
[01:27:28.386 --> 01:27:29.466]  Can't wait till he's on with us.
[01:27:29.466 --> 01:27:31.627]  So the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:27:31.627 --> 01:27:31.687]  877-789-2539.
[01:27:31.687 --> 01:27:31.727]  877-789-2539.
[01:27:42.659 --> 01:27:49.300]  This news, New York Times report confirms what many suspected about Biden's reelection campaign strategy.
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:53.681]  I was flipping through the channels this morning and saw MSNBC saying, it's a great strategy, so smart.
[01:27:53.681 --> 01:27:55.361]  He's going to hide in the basement.
[01:27:55.361 --> 01:27:57.682]  So they own the ridiculousness of it.
[01:27:57.682 --> 01:28:02.203]  He's going to win by not campaigning because they're going to manipulate the data.
[01:28:02.203 --> 01:28:03.243]  They're going to put out false stories.
[01:28:03.243 --> 01:28:06.564]  They're going to block stories critical of the corrupt Democratic Party.
[01:28:06.564 --> 01:28:07.604]  That's election meddling.
[01:28:07.604 --> 01:28:08.984]  What they claim the Russians did, they have been
[01:28:09.716 --> 01:28:16.642]  Admittedly doing, testifying they've done, and Biden is going to ride it out again in a basement.
[01:28:16.642 --> 01:28:17.943]  And RFK made a great point on that.
[01:28:17.943 --> 01:28:19.104]  We'll play when we come back.
[01:28:19.104 --> 01:28:19.665]  RFK Jr.
[01:28:19.665 --> 01:28:23.368]  explains how the Democratic Party is already rigging the 2024 race.
[01:28:23.368 --> 01:28:27.992]  That is all coming up and so much more.
[01:28:27.992 --> 01:28:33.177]  And I'll cover the bug stuff with Fletcher, because that's something I want to get his take on.
[01:28:34.725 --> 01:28:39.969]  They're literally rolling out baby formula and telling liberals, save the earth.
[01:28:39.969 --> 01:28:49.316]  And then liberals are getting baby formula made out of ground up dead bugs with all the health problems that chitin causes and feeding it to them.
[01:28:49.316 --> 01:28:51.117]  I mean, wow.
[01:28:51.117 --> 01:28:52.859]  Absolutely insane.
[01:28:52.859 --> 01:28:53.819]  Infowars.com.
[01:28:53.819 --> 01:28:54.780]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:55.641]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:58.749 --> 01:29:03.772]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[01:29:03.772 --> 01:29:05.953]  We made it even stronger.
[01:29:05.953 --> 01:29:09.696]  The strongest long-term energy you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:29:09.696 --> 01:29:14.839]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:29:14.839 --> 01:29:23.004]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[01:29:23.004 --> 01:29:24.085]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:29:24.765 --> 01:29:37.832]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[01:29:37.832 --> 01:29:39.813]  It is the super fuel.
[01:29:39.813 --> 01:29:41.293]  RainForce Plus is great.
[01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:42.134]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[01:29:42.134 --> 01:29:43.114]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:29:43.114 --> 01:29:44.295]  They go good with this.
[01:29:44.295 --> 01:29:46.316]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:29:47.057 --> 01:29:48.518]  This is the Boss.
[01:29:48.518 --> 01:29:49.258]  TurboForce.
[01:29:49.258 --> 01:29:50.279]  Back in stock.
[01:29:50.279 --> 01:29:51.319]  Discounted.
[01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:53.020]  M4WarStore.com.
[01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:53.901]  More power.
[01:29:53.901 --> 01:29:54.902]  More strength.
[01:29:54.902 --> 01:29:55.402]  More energy.
[01:29:58.863 --> 01:30:04.865]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:30:04.865 --> 01:30:07.505]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:30:07.505 --> 01:30:09.686]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:30:09.686 --> 01:30:12.286]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:30:12.286 --> 01:30:15.487]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:30:15.487 --> 01:30:17.268]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[01:30:17.268 --> 01:30:23.889]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:30:23.889 --> 01:30:26.670]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:30:27.662 --> 01:30:29.763]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:30:29.763 --> 01:30:34.407]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:30:34.407 --> 01:30:38.109]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:30:38.109 --> 01:30:41.251]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage you as listeners to understand.
[01:30:41.251 --> 01:30:43.813]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[01:30:43.813 --> 01:30:45.174]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:30:45.174 --> 01:30:50.958]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:50.958 --> 01:30:52.318]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:30:52.318 --> 01:30:53.639]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:53.639 --> 01:30:57.582]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[01:30:58.402 --> 01:31:05.826]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[01:31:05.826 --> 01:31:08.627]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:31:08.627 --> 01:31:16.991]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[01:31:16.991 --> 01:31:19.412]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:31:19.412 --> 01:31:22.414]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[01:31:22.734 --> 01:31:25.295]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[01:31:25.295 --> 01:31:33.698]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[01:31:33.698 --> 01:31:35.559]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[01:31:35.559 --> 01:31:42.642]  government began buying this toxic, untreated, industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:31:42.642 --> 01:31:47.844]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:31:47.844 --> 01:31:51.245]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[01:31:52.445 --> 01:32:04.308]  This is their big move.
[01:32:04.308 --> 01:32:08.089]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:09.810]  He doesn't care.
[01:32:09.810 --> 01:32:11.050]  That's not his job.
[01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:12.811]  He's not the President of the United States.
[01:32:12.811 --> 01:32:16.672]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:32:16.672 --> 01:32:18.032]  Appetites of the autocrat.
[01:32:18.956 --> 01:32:21.157]  Cannot be appeased.
[01:32:21.157 --> 01:32:22.898]  They must be opposed.
[01:32:22.898 --> 01:32:26.320]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:27.520]  No.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:28.340]  No.
[01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:29.121]  No.
[01:32:29.121 --> 01:32:30.001]  Exactly.
[01:32:30.001 --> 01:32:33.583]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:32:33.583 --> 01:32:36.664]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:32:36.664 --> 01:32:39.146]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:32:39.146 --> 01:32:41.647]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:32:41.647 --> 01:32:45.269]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:32:45.269 --> 01:32:47.790]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[01:32:47.790 --> 01:32:48.190]  You're right.
[01:32:48.470 --> 01:33:00.555]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no, and we say no to your war.
[01:33:00.555 --> 01:33:06.437]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:30.453]  Okay, look, I know the general audience here knows we're under a globalist coup and they're removing all the checks and balances and surveilling us and censoring us and poisoning us and all of that.
[01:33:46.633 --> 01:33:50.076]  But if you look at what they did with Bernie Sanders, who I cannot stand.
[01:33:50.076 --> 01:33:53.499]  What a terrible, horrible, dirty leech.
[01:33:53.499 --> 01:33:54.500]  Never worked a day in his life.
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:58.443]  Communist with his disgusting, corrupt wife and all of them.
[01:33:58.443 --> 01:33:59.644]  But he was winning.
[01:33:59.644 --> 01:34:02.827]  He was beating Hillary Clinton in the primaries.
[01:34:02.827 --> 01:34:05.609]  And they stole it from him.
[01:34:05.609 --> 01:34:13.736]  And so they then changed party rules even more, where when he would win a state, like California, they'd say, well, the delegates have decided to go for Hillary.
[01:34:14.591 --> 01:34:19.235]  And in New Hampshire, months before that happened, we interviewed one of Hillary's delegates.
[01:34:19.235 --> 01:34:21.296]  And he said, Bernie, we'll get some votes, but it doesn't matter.
[01:34:21.296 --> 01:34:23.538]  We're all going to, you know, pledge to Hillary.
[01:34:23.538 --> 01:34:24.679]  We already pledged her.
[01:34:24.679 --> 01:34:29.022]  That was a famous clip that went viral on national television.
[01:34:29.022 --> 01:34:31.304]  Our great Richard Reeves, reporter at the time, got that.
[01:34:33.004 --> 01:34:51.773]  But now they've officially changed the rules where they're not even having caucuses, they're not even having debates, they're not even having anything in these states, like New Hampshire or other places, where, or South Carolina, Roger Stone was talking about that last hour, where there's just nobody but Joe Biden, and then he's gonna stay in the basement.
[01:34:51.773 --> 01:34:59.016]  So, this is designed, obviously, to give you one candidate, which is called election meddling, which is called manipulation.
[01:34:59.016 --> 01:35:00.137]  Here's Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:35:00.137 --> 01:35:00.577]  talking about it.
[01:35:01.551 --> 01:35:28.256]  We should be, at this point in history, when you have so many Americans who are concerned about election integrity, we should be doing everything we can in our party to show that, you know, this is not a rigged system, that it is actually democracy, that you have a chance and that, you know, people can run and that they can get to debate and that the public is going to be able to see them.
[01:35:29.748 --> 01:35:31.290]  And they're doing kind of the opposite.
[01:35:31.290 --> 01:35:33.712]  They're going to say, there's no debate.
[01:35:33.712 --> 01:35:41.438]  We're going to put the system so a state that we can rig is going to go in first.
[01:35:41.438 --> 01:35:48.264]  And that's how we're going to, you know, there's too many Americans already think that the whole system is rigged against them.
[01:35:48.264 --> 01:35:50.186]  And this is just confirmation of that.
[01:35:50.186 --> 01:35:52.328]  And I think that's troubling.
[01:35:53.246 --> 01:35:57.888]  All right, so listeners and dear viewers, I could spend another hour just on this.
[01:35:57.888 --> 01:36:00.930]  It's a lengthy article on Infowars.com.
[01:36:00.930 --> 01:36:03.731]  RFK explains how Democratic Party is already rigging the 2024 race.
[01:36:03.731 --> 01:36:08.373]  It's like a 30-minute interview, plus it has links and all the proof where you want to know the specifics, okay?
[01:36:08.373 --> 01:36:10.214]  But it's unbelievable.
[01:36:10.214 --> 01:36:12.535]  And Town Hall did a story, too.
[01:36:12.535 --> 01:36:16.136]  Oh, so that's why no one can challenge Biden within the Democratic Party.
[01:36:16.136 --> 01:36:17.257]  So that's another article on it.
[01:36:18.536 --> 01:36:20.277]  It's just, it's over the top.
[01:36:20.277 --> 01:36:22.017]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[01:36:22.017 --> 01:36:24.338]  They tell you they're not manipulating anything.
[01:36:24.338 --> 01:36:28.020]  They tried to block 22 members of Congress.
[01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:33.342]  Everybody knows about Gozer and MTG, but it was like 20 others on top of that.
[01:36:33.342 --> 01:36:45.407]  The Democratic Party went around with lawyers and sued in Georgia and Tennessee and all the key battleground states to block Congress people that have won, particularly with landslides,
[01:36:46.491 --> 01:36:50.653]  From being able to run because they were at the Capitol on January 6th.
[01:36:50.653 --> 01:36:54.715]  I mean, that's election meddling, period.
[01:36:54.715 --> 01:36:58.076]  They're stopping the candidate before they even get to election day.
[01:36:58.076 --> 01:36:59.937]  Just like indicting Trump.
[01:36:59.937 --> 01:37:01.058]  Same thing over again.
[01:37:01.058 --> 01:37:03.279]  And I know everybody knows this.
[01:37:03.279 --> 01:37:04.940]  The audience is like, tell us something we don't know.
[01:37:05.899 --> 01:37:08.180]  Well, the general public doesn't know this, okay?
[01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:17.865]  They're all arguing about satellites, and Italy, and, you know, the Israelis, and the Russians, and all this BS, okay?
[01:37:17.865 --> 01:37:21.687]  Yeah, they can hack the machines, but that can be caught.
[01:37:21.687 --> 01:37:31.573]  But if you have a bunch of dead people voting, and a bunch of people voting who don't even live in the district anymore, and they got mail-in ballots, and they got Democrats at the boxes stuffing hundreds of men, they got caught!
[01:37:31.573 --> 01:37:32.653]  That's how they did it.
[01:37:32.653 --> 01:37:34.054]  But that's the side issue.
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:50.508]  Trump still won despite all of the election meddling, and the spiking of stories, and the blocking Republican candidates, and censoring Trump, and all of it, show they had to then cram it with ballots they filled out at their Democrat Party offices.
[01:37:50.508 --> 01:38:02.635]  And 2,000 people's documents that, with the Necessuza, because they were able to buy the satellite tracking data, and show how they all go to this building, and they get their ballots, and they all leave, and go to all these points, and you know,
[01:38:03.803 --> 01:38:05.885]  Some people did 20 drops, most did about 10.
[01:38:05.885 --> 01:38:10.069]  And they go cram 20 ballots in here, 20 ballots in there, 30 ballots in here.
[01:38:10.069 --> 01:38:11.751]  I said I'd take your calls, didn't I?
[01:38:11.751 --> 01:38:14.414]  But I've kind of gone off on a jag about this.
[01:38:14.414 --> 01:38:17.397]  We know how they did it.
[01:38:17.397 --> 01:38:19.399]  And we've laid it out.
[01:38:19.399 --> 01:38:21.541]  Where are the congressional hearings?
[01:38:21.541 --> 01:38:22.842]  Instead they use the red herring of
[01:38:25.509 --> 01:38:35.356]  The Italians and the Jews and the Russians and the... No, it's the Democratic Party right there doing it in your face.
[01:38:35.356 --> 01:38:43.042]  They're the mechanism of the globalist, opening the borders, pushing poison shots on us, and they've got every major leader on their payroll pushing it.
[01:38:44.707 --> 01:38:47.509]  And I like Trump a lot, but he went along with the shots.
[01:38:47.509 --> 01:38:49.430]  I do not dislike Benjamin Netanyahu.
[01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:50.691]  He went along with it.
[01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:54.133]  And look, you gotta just say, this is wrong, we're not putting up with it.
[01:38:54.133 --> 01:38:57.575]  But that big pharma money sure flowed out there, didn't it?
[01:38:57.575 --> 01:38:58.976]  All right, let's start going to your calls.
[01:38:58.976 --> 01:39:05.179]  Joe and Angel and Terry and Andrew and Brian and Ray, we'll get to all of you ahead of Bob Fletcher joining us.
[01:39:05.179 --> 01:39:08.221]  I was thinking of Bob Chapman earlier, another great guy that left us.
[01:39:08.221 --> 01:39:09.402]  Love him.
[01:39:09.402 --> 01:39:11.583]  But to Bob Fletcher joining us.
[01:39:11.583 --> 01:39:14.425]  Angel in the great state of Texas, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:17.491]  Hey, great to talk to you again.
[01:39:17.491 --> 01:39:18.673]  Alex?
[01:39:18.673 --> 01:39:21.155]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:39:21.155 --> 01:39:23.557]  Alright, so you remember Brandon House?
[01:39:23.557 --> 01:39:29.803]  He's actually one of the hosts for Mike Lindell in one of his shows.
[01:39:29.803 --> 01:39:36.249]  He alluded to this fact, he got an email, two things were going to happen at Fox.
[01:39:36.249 --> 01:39:38.091]  One, Tucker Carlson was going to get fired.
[01:39:39.895 --> 01:39:45.659]  Box was going to get scooped up by one of the hedge funds, and it turns out... Yes, BlackRock is looking to buy it.
[01:39:45.659 --> 01:39:47.079]  We covered that Monday.
[01:39:47.079 --> 01:39:49.101]  Absolutely, that's true.
[01:39:49.101 --> 01:39:52.963]  I think they already did.
[01:39:52.963 --> 01:39:56.285]  Alright, anything else you'd like to answer?
[01:39:56.285 --> 01:40:08.233]  Yeah, because I guess they're lighting everything up, so everything's stacked up against Trump, but I think that there's more things being played out.
[01:40:09.392 --> 01:40:14.154]  Behind the scenes, because I think Tucker Carlson still has that footage.
[01:40:14.154 --> 01:40:18.455]  He does have that footage, and they were scared of what he was going to do in the future, as Roger Stone said last hour.
[01:40:18.455 --> 01:40:19.236]  You're dead on.
[01:40:19.236 --> 01:40:20.636]  Thank you, Angel.
[01:40:20.636 --> 01:40:26.878]  Yes, Murdoch is looking to sell Fox entirely, not just have BlackRock prop the stock up.
[01:40:26.878 --> 01:40:28.559]  And this is all part of it.
[01:40:28.559 --> 01:40:30.099]  There's not one reason he was removed.
[01:40:30.099 --> 01:40:31.620]  It was all of it.
[01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:34.061]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in South Carolina.
[01:40:34.061 --> 01:40:34.361]  Go ahead.
[01:40:35.726 --> 01:40:37.367]  Alex, you're an American hero.
[01:40:37.367 --> 01:40:39.068]  I'll cut to the chase.
[01:40:39.068 --> 01:40:40.209]  First, I want to plug your book.
[01:40:40.209 --> 01:40:41.429]  I got a signed copy back.
[01:40:41.429 --> 01:40:42.030]  It was only $50.
[01:40:42.030 --> 01:40:45.592]  I've been watching you about close to 20 years.
[01:40:45.592 --> 01:40:46.612]  First time caller.
[01:40:46.612 --> 01:40:48.894]  Well, let me just say this real quick and I won't cut you off.
[01:40:48.894 --> 01:40:50.935]  I don't want to charge you $100 for a signed book.
[01:40:50.935 --> 01:40:52.756]  If we didn't do that, we'd be shut down right now.
[01:40:52.756 --> 01:40:55.137]  We're barely paying the bills to our regular books like $20.
[01:40:55.137 --> 01:40:56.478]  A signed one's $100.
[01:40:56.478 --> 01:40:57.859]  There's only a few hundred left.
[01:40:57.859 --> 01:40:59.039]  InfoWarcher.com.
[01:40:59.039 --> 01:41:00.360]  It's because you want to donate.
[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:01.881]  You want to have that piece of history.
[01:41:01.881 --> 01:41:02.841]  You want to know you kept us on air.
[01:41:02.841 --> 01:41:04.562]  So I want to thank you for getting the book.
[01:41:04.562 --> 01:41:05.043]  Thank you, sir.
[01:41:05.043 --> 01:41:05.263]  Go ahead.
[01:41:06.337 --> 01:41:10.998]  Well, you wanted to start with Tucker, but it all ties in because he fought propaganda.
[01:41:10.998 --> 01:41:16.740]  My idea is that there needs to be a full disclosure of everything we know about psychological warfare.
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:24.203]  The argument could be made, you know, well, that's not in the interest of national security, but, you know, the Chinese have been doing this since Sun Tzu, you know, the use of spies.
[01:41:24.203 --> 01:41:25.083]  We know this.
[01:41:25.083 --> 01:41:34.866]  There's no other way to really go to the mattresses and, you know, maybe two weeks to flatten the enemy and just re-educate the public.
[01:41:35.393 --> 01:41:45.559]  You know, I also wanted to say that I think in short format, somehow, Greg would probably be great at it, to teach people how to research like you guys do.
[01:41:45.559 --> 01:41:52.564]  Finally, and I got lots more to say, but I know your time is precious, but one thing to note is that these are supremacy movements.
[01:41:53.529 --> 01:41:59.694]  These social movements that we're seeing, because they do not provide for conflict resolution.
[01:41:59.694 --> 01:42:05.458]  No one ever says, well, when will we stop doing these cruel experiments with school children?
[01:42:05.458 --> 01:42:09.161]  It's just tipping the scales.
[01:42:09.161 --> 01:42:14.905]  There's supremacy movements backed by the establishment that then cause a societal breakdown, and that's what they're designed to do.
[01:42:15.712 --> 01:42:21.956]  The main characterization or trait of these is they do not provide for conflict resolution.
[01:42:21.956 --> 01:42:29.662]  Yeah, for folks that don't know, what you're saying is complex sociology and human political psychology don't hang up.
[01:42:30.475 --> 01:42:37.199]  Brian, I'm going to come back to you to explain why these are supremacy movements, and you absolutely, properly break that down.
[01:42:37.199 --> 01:42:42.381]  So Tucker said in his speech at the Heritage Foundation Friday, this is not like two sides working together for the future.
[01:42:42.381 --> 01:42:52.187]  This is a side that wants total supremacy, total power, and to outlaw its opposition to then carry out a hellish, totalitarian, dystopic takeover, which you can see all around you.
[01:42:52.187 --> 01:42:54.188]  Only a psychotic moron would go along with this.
[01:42:59.881 --> 01:43:03.023]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:43:03.023 --> 01:43:05.324]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:43:05.324 --> 01:43:09.246]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:43:09.246 --> 01:43:18.190]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:43:18.190 --> 01:43:25.974]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:43:27.006 --> 01:43:29.888]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:43:29.888 --> 01:43:36.431]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:43:36.431 --> 01:43:47.697]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it, but most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:43:48.597 --> 01:43:50.639]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:43:50.639 --> 01:43:54.741]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[01:43:54.741 --> 01:43:58.444]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[01:44:11.673 --> 01:44:22.415]  That's why I asked listeners respectfully to go to InfoWarStore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[01:44:22.415 --> 01:44:37.678]  InfoWarStore.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World, Ultimate Bone Broth, Back and Stock, Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[01:44:38.278 --> 01:44:40.480]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:42.321]  Some of the very best products.
[01:44:42.321 --> 01:44:44.442]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWarsTore.
[01:44:44.442 --> 01:44:49.786]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWarsTore.
[01:44:49.786 --> 01:44:52.648]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[01:44:52.648 --> 01:44:54.009]  Plus, they keep us on air.
[01:44:54.009 --> 01:44:55.530]  So again, please take action.
[01:44:55.530 --> 01:44:58.332]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com today, and I thank you.
[01:44:58.772 --> 01:45:04.374]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially with word of mouth and prayer.
[01:45:04.374 --> 01:45:11.977]  All the success that we've had together against the Globalists and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[01:45:11.977 --> 01:45:14.198]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:45:14.918 --> 01:45:15.198]  That's right.
[01:45:32.862 --> 01:45:35.204]  You'll see a link to make a straight donation.
[01:45:35.204 --> 01:45:41.250]  A one-time donation of $5, $10, $50, or a recurring donation you can cancel anytime.
[01:45:41.250 --> 01:45:42.791]  I want to thank all you that have donated.
[01:45:42.791 --> 01:45:56.243]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support Freedom to take action now and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's countering the Great Reset by going to InfoWarsTore.com and clicking on the donate button and giving today.
[01:45:56.243 --> 01:45:57.564]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:45:57.564 --> 01:45:58.225]  Please take action.
[01:45:58.570 --> 01:46:05.973]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[01:46:05.973 --> 01:46:08.795]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:46:08.795 --> 01:46:17.158]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[01:46:17.158 --> 01:46:19.580]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:22.581]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[01:46:22.901 --> 01:46:25.462]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[01:46:25.462 --> 01:46:33.866]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[01:46:33.866 --> 01:46:35.726]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[01:46:35.726 --> 01:46:42.809]  government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:46:42.809 --> 01:46:48.011]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:46:48.011 --> 01:46:51.433]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[01:46:51.713 --> 01:46:54.095]  And a remedy to this madness.
[01:46:54.095 --> 01:46:59.779]  Available now at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:46:59.779 --> 01:47:04.383]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:04.383 --> 01:47:05.704]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:47:31.043 --> 01:47:39.150]  Alright, I don't want Brian, and we're going to get everybody else here, Ray, Andrew, Terry, Joe, and others to get cut off here, because he explains something really important.
[01:47:39.150 --> 01:47:41.592]  It's what Tucker again said last Friday, it's what I keep hammering.
[01:47:41.592 --> 01:47:43.454]  The globalists admit they want destabilization.
[01:47:43.454 --> 01:47:45.256]  They don't want to fix problems.
[01:47:45.256 --> 01:47:51.541]  They create problems and then have solutions that make problems worse to collapse society for full control because they have unlimited money.
[01:47:51.541 --> 01:47:56.065]  Then they'll use that to come in and get absolute dominance over us and dictate the terms of our surrender.
[01:47:57.225 --> 01:48:04.509]  So you're saying some really important political science things here that I think the general public's unaware of, so you've obviously been to school or read books on this.
[01:48:04.509 --> 01:48:13.595]  Explain what you mean by a supremacy movement versus an open, free society movement.
[01:48:13.595 --> 01:48:14.756]  Go ahead, Brian.
[01:48:14.756 --> 01:48:25.182]  The thing that differentiates them, and the defining attribute in this case, what we're seeing now, is that these things do not provide for conflict resolution.
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:31.867]  No one says, when will the cruel experiments with school children end?
[01:48:31.867 --> 01:48:34.309]  It's just, this is the way it is now.
[01:48:34.309 --> 01:48:38.474]  Without conflict resolution, it's inherently supremacy.
[01:48:38.474 --> 01:48:43.219]  Now, it's disguised by the fact that, you know, these politicians espouse to
[01:48:43.902 --> 01:48:48.584]  You mean hiring 87,000 IRS agents and saying they're all going to be used on poor people is not helpful?
[01:48:48.584 --> 01:48:52.246]  I got stacks of articles where everything Biden's doing is to hurt poor people.
[01:49:03.447 --> 01:49:17.029]  Yeah, no, it really seems to anybody that's astute or away, it's everything that's happened is, you know, designed to stifle your movement or any aspect of your life, to move on, you know, against the family.
[01:49:17.029 --> 01:49:20.790]  I mean, you listen to people, believe them the first time they say something.
[01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:26.511]  That's why I think, you know, if you teach people to research, you very well may well get shut down.
[01:49:26.511 --> 01:49:28.811]  And then, you know, people rely on you.
[01:49:28.811 --> 01:49:30.352]  Again, back to your book, quick.
[01:49:30.352 --> 01:49:31.412]  I got a signed copy.
[01:49:32.123 --> 01:49:33.924]  Um, you know, I got it.
[01:49:33.924 --> 01:49:38.426]  It was to illustrate how quickly I got it, because I saw the lawsuit and everything, unfortunately.
[01:49:38.426 --> 01:49:43.548]  It wasn't to say, you know, you don't deserve every penny of that, and that we shouldn't support you.
[01:49:43.548 --> 01:49:52.112]  I was just illustrating the fact that I got it as soon as I could, because I've been an ardent supporter of yours, and you woke me up close to 20 years ago.
[01:49:52.112 --> 01:49:54.513]  But Brian, I appreciate you.
[01:49:55.086 --> 01:49:58.967]  The propaganda was legalized by Obama, but it can't be legalized.
[01:49:58.967 --> 01:50:00.208]  Neither can murder.
[01:50:00.208 --> 01:50:02.809]  When you're using it as a... No, they don't glaze over that either.
[01:50:02.809 --> 01:50:12.772]  Obama in 2010 got a law passed legalizing the CIA and State Department and other agencies lying to the American people.
[01:50:12.772 --> 01:50:14.033]  Thank you for the call.
[01:50:14.033 --> 01:50:14.553]  Thank you so much.
[01:50:14.553 --> 01:50:15.813]  We've got to get to everybody else here.
[01:50:15.813 --> 01:50:16.914]  Joe in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:50:16.914 --> 01:50:18.795]  Go ahead.
[01:50:18.795 --> 01:50:20.815]  Hey Alex, thanks so much for having me on.
[01:50:20.815 --> 01:50:22.156]  I love everything you do.
[01:50:23.816 --> 01:50:24.957]  I love your products, by the way.
[01:50:24.957 --> 01:50:28.759]  I'd like to encourage the listeners to try the products if you haven't.
[01:50:28.759 --> 01:50:35.344]  I've used a whole bunch of your supplements, and I love them.
[01:50:35.344 --> 01:50:43.169]  I've heard you talk a lot about the insects being toxic, and I don't know if you remember talking to me before.
[01:50:43.169 --> 01:50:47.712]  I'm a horticultural scientist, and I spoke to you about the CO2 a little bit.
[01:50:47.712 --> 01:50:51.074]  Sure, and how it makes the plants grow way faster, and it's amazing.
[01:50:51.787 --> 01:50:58.632]  Right, how we would use it in our grow rooms at three times the level that's average in the atmosphere currently.
[01:50:58.632 --> 01:51:13.744]  But anyway, so hearing you talk about the insects, as a horticulturalist, I have to know about mycology, which is the study of fungi, and entomology, which is a study of insects, because both of those affect plants.
[01:51:13.744 --> 01:51:19.709]  So, it occurred to me that chitin, which you speak about quite a bit,
[01:51:20.376 --> 01:51:23.619]  Is what fungi are made out of, what mushrooms are made out of.
[01:51:23.619 --> 01:51:25.040]  I actually have that in my stack.
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:26.281]  Let me show TV viewers.
[01:51:26.281 --> 01:51:28.683]  Exactly.
[01:51:28.683 --> 01:51:31.125]  Continue.
[01:51:31.125 --> 01:51:40.793]  Well, so that compelled me to research it further because I wanted to know what's the difference in the chitin that's in insects and the chitin that's in mushrooms.
[01:51:40.793 --> 01:51:42.334]  And I came to
[01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:47.471]  Well, I wrote an article about it for my Substack, the Bender Observatory.
[01:51:47.471 --> 01:51:52.252]  It's at joebender.substack.com.
[01:51:52.252 --> 01:51:55.833]  And it's called Eat Z Bugs.
[01:51:55.833 --> 01:52:11.436]  And I found that the structures that the insects have on their bodies, their spurs, spines, and setae, which are like hairs, those, I think, are one of the causes of toxicity.
[01:52:12.196 --> 01:52:12.557]  I don't know.
[01:52:26.795 --> 01:52:27.735]  That's titan also.
[01:52:48.624 --> 01:52:54.506]  Bugs that have shells around the world, except a few Asian countries, and it's like a weird seasoning.
[01:52:54.506 --> 01:52:56.427]  This is insane.
[01:52:56.427 --> 01:52:56.987]  Look at this headline.
[01:52:56.987 --> 01:52:58.487]  What do you make of this?
[01:52:58.487 --> 01:53:03.069]  Food writer cuts her grocery bill in half by feeding her baby crickets.
[01:53:03.069 --> 01:53:07.490]  And there's a big article in the Huffington Post saying, feed your baby bug protein.
[01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:09.651]  Well, folks, babies don't eat bugs.
[01:53:09.651 --> 01:53:11.791]  Babies don't drink bug soup.
[01:53:11.791 --> 01:53:15.633]  I mean, but the left, it's like anything to hurt a kid.
[01:53:15.633 --> 01:53:16.293]  It's their religion.
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:20.443]  That's right.
[01:53:20.443 --> 01:53:23.446]  I also found that there's a major allergen.
[01:53:23.446 --> 01:53:32.114]  The major allergen in crustaceans is not chitin, but it's actually tropomyosin.
[01:53:32.114 --> 01:53:35.698]  It's also found in insects and mites as well.
[01:53:36.221 --> 01:53:41.205]  Not to mention that everybody knows, you know, you got to de-vein a shrimp.
[01:53:41.205 --> 01:53:42.366]  That's not a bug.
[01:53:42.366 --> 01:53:45.809]  But the point is, is that they're not de-veining these bugs.
[01:53:45.809 --> 01:53:48.351]  And bugs have a very short intestinal tract.
[01:53:48.351 --> 01:53:51.794]  Most of them have really bad parasites.
[01:53:51.794 --> 01:53:52.234]  They do.
[01:53:52.234 --> 01:54:03.644]  They have, uh, they don't have a circulatory system and they have, uh, their gastrointestinal tract goes across the length of their whole body practically, but, but there's no way to get rid of it in that small of an animal.
[01:54:04.557 --> 01:54:07.498]  So it's not like you're gutting it like you would a deer or something.
[01:54:07.498 --> 01:54:11.959]  So you're not just going to eat bugs, you're going to eat bug crap and parasites.
[01:54:11.959 --> 01:54:17.981]  Right, and all the microbes that grow in their crap inside their body.
[01:54:17.981 --> 01:54:22.543]  And so those are major problems.
[01:54:22.543 --> 01:54:26.604]  Well Joe, I don't mean to cut you off, but you called in about Tucker Carlson.
[01:54:26.604 --> 01:54:29.765]  Well, you know, he recently did a report.
[01:54:29.765 --> 01:54:31.845]  He's about to air you will eat the bugs.
[01:54:31.845 --> 01:54:33.486]  He had a documentary coming out about Klaus Schwab.
[01:54:34.761 --> 01:54:38.564]  Yeah, I just saw parts of the preview for it on his main show.
[01:54:38.564 --> 01:54:43.588]  Yeah, yeah, he signed off Friday with a promo for Eat the Bugs this week.
[01:54:43.588 --> 01:54:52.296]  Yeah, so I tried to send him some information on that, but I, you know... Yeah, unfortunately he only focused on the parasites, not the chitin and all the stuff you said.
[01:54:52.296 --> 01:54:54.557]  Thanks for the call, I can talk to you for an hour, we're good to hear about it.
[01:54:54.557 --> 01:54:57.780]  Ray in Missouri, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:54:57.780 --> 01:54:58.881]  Yes, can you hear me Alex?
[01:54:58.881 --> 01:54:59.662]  I can brother, go ahead.
[01:55:01.485 --> 01:55:02.786]  Long time viewer.
[01:55:02.786 --> 01:55:03.506]  Watched the show.
[01:55:03.506 --> 01:55:04.247]  I love it.
[01:55:04.247 --> 01:55:04.867]  Supplements.
[01:55:04.867 --> 01:55:08.169]  Got my Alex for President-y shooting yesterday.
[01:55:08.169 --> 01:55:09.150]  I love it.
[01:55:09.150 --> 01:55:09.750]  Thank you.
[01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:18.075]  My thing is, the thing about Tucker Carlson, the left, the globalists, you know, they bided their time.
[01:55:18.075 --> 01:55:22.438]  And they infiltrated our government, our schools, and they're everywhere.
[01:55:22.438 --> 01:55:22.999]  Yep.
[01:55:22.999 --> 01:55:26.501]  And it started out, Alex, I love Trump.
[01:55:26.501 --> 01:55:28.362]  I love Donald Trump's death.
[01:55:28.362 --> 01:55:29.763]  It started out though with you.
[01:55:31.285 --> 01:55:39.612]  Once they tested the waters and they were able to silence you, Donald Trump should have stepped in right then and there and said, you know what?
[01:55:39.612 --> 01:55:41.333]  There's freedom of speech.
[01:55:41.333 --> 01:55:42.714]  You cannot do what you're doing.
[01:55:42.714 --> 01:55:43.915]  It's against the law.
[01:55:43.915 --> 01:55:45.877]  It's against the Constitution.
[01:55:45.877 --> 01:55:54.423]  And by the way, they had a big investigative report six months before they banned me in the Wall Street Journal saying it was a plan that once they brought me down they could bring everybody down.
[01:55:54.423 --> 01:55:55.884]  That's why I didn't feel that bad when it happened.
[01:55:55.884 --> 01:55:57.906]  I felt bad for everybody because they admitted this was a plan.
[01:55:59.173 --> 01:56:00.014]  Exactly.
[01:56:00.014 --> 01:56:05.638]  Once that happened and the floodgates were open, brother, that was it.
[01:56:05.638 --> 01:56:07.559]  Now it's out of control.
[01:56:07.559 --> 01:56:11.922]  Well, what do you think we do now, Ray?
[01:56:11.922 --> 01:56:16.005]  I just think we keep on fighting a good fight.
[01:56:16.005 --> 01:56:22.629]  I don't believe we're at the turning point where there's a point of no return yet.
[01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:26.152]  But I think we're getting there, though.
[01:56:26.152 --> 01:56:27.673]  Everything you see when you look
[01:56:29.610 --> 01:56:33.334]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:33.334 --> 01:56:35.437]  Your phone's breaking up, but you made some good points.
[01:56:35.437 --> 01:56:35.817]  Thank you.
[01:56:35.817 --> 01:56:37.499]  At the end, it cut out there.
[01:56:37.499 --> 01:56:38.841]  All right.
[01:56:38.841 --> 01:56:41.104]  I'm going to go to break.
[01:56:41.104 --> 01:56:41.905]  And I'm going to come back.
[01:56:43.885 --> 01:56:49.188]  And I'm going to hit two more calls, Terry and Andrew, ahead of Bob Fletcher, who is just amazing.
[01:56:49.188 --> 01:56:54.590]  Don't know who he is, I'll introduce you to him, but he predicted decades ago with research what was going to happen.
[01:56:54.590 --> 01:56:59.653]  We'll kind of cover that, but people that don't know who he is don't know that, but it's almost like going over old ground.
[01:56:59.653 --> 01:57:00.933]  We'll spend a little time on that.
[01:57:00.933 --> 01:57:07.957]  But we're going to get Bob Fletcher, who's 80-something years old, but still as sharp as a razor blade, to tell us what he thinks is coming next and what we can do.
[01:57:07.957 --> 01:57:10.118]  So I really look forward to that coming up.
[01:57:11.218 --> 01:57:13.499]  Speaking of support in the broadcast, we need your support.
[01:57:13.499 --> 01:57:15.861]  I want to thank all of you that got t-shirts and got books.
[01:57:15.861 --> 01:57:17.262]  Thank you for keeping us on air.
[01:57:17.262 --> 01:57:20.443]  I want to thank all of you that got the great supplements, plus they're good for your body.
[01:57:20.443 --> 01:57:23.525]  I want to thank you all for your word of mouth, but please keep redoubling your efforts.
[01:57:23.525 --> 01:57:34.972]  And I want to encourage all the listeners that tune in that don't buy product, less than 1% of my product, go to InfoWarsTore.com, get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get TurboForce and see how amazing this 10-hour energy is.
[01:57:34.972 --> 01:57:36.593]  Get some of the krill oil.
[01:57:36.593 --> 01:57:37.994]  Get some 1776 testosterone boost.
[01:57:40.615 --> 01:57:42.101]  Just take action.
[01:57:42.101 --> 01:57:43.387]  You are the answer.
[01:57:43.387 --> 01:57:44.371]  You are the victory.
[01:57:44.371 --> 01:57:44.913]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:49.218 --> 01:57:55.222]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:57:55.222 --> 01:57:57.864]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:57:57.864 --> 01:58:00.065]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:58:00.065 --> 01:58:02.647]  They only got Tucker Carlson on the air because they believe they can control him.
[01:58:02.647 --> 01:58:05.869]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:58:05.869 --> 01:58:07.630]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[01:58:07.630 --> 01:58:14.255]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:58:14.255 --> 01:58:17.057]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:58:18.021 --> 01:58:20.122]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:58:20.122 --> 01:58:24.766]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:58:24.766 --> 01:58:28.488]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:58:28.488 --> 01:58:31.610]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[01:58:31.610 --> 01:58:34.172]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[01:58:34.172 --> 01:58:35.533]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:58:35.533 --> 01:58:41.317]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:41.317 --> 01:58:42.677]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:58:42.677 --> 01:58:43.998]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:43.998 --> 01:58:47.961]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[01:58:48.108 --> 01:58:48.380]  Shhh!
[01:58:57.239 --> 01:59:05.944]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements, because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[01:59:05.944 --> 01:59:08.125]  So support InfoWarsTore.
[01:59:08.125 --> 01:59:16.609]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority, because you don't know, I don't know, Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[01:59:16.609 --> 01:59:21.272]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[01:59:21.272 --> 01:59:22.172]  Krill oil.
[01:59:22.172 --> 01:59:24.894]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a
[01:59:25.774 --> 01:59:26.575]  I think so.
[01:59:50.586 --> 01:59:55.189]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:56.470]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:12.890 --> 02:00:13.350]  Hey!
[02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:15.611]  Hey there, Mr. Jones!
[02:00:15.611 --> 02:00:17.731]  Hey there!
[02:00:17.731 --> 02:00:26.012]  I'm calling to say that I think Tucker is right on saying that we need to pray for America, that we need to pray for this country and pray for each other.
[02:00:26.012 --> 02:00:34.674]  I'd like to thank you for doing your good work and doing the job that God has set out before you.
[02:00:34.674 --> 02:00:40.235]  It's really exciting to be on the air, I don't even know why, but I think
[02:00:41.263 --> 02:00:45.987]  I think that more importantly we need to look at what they don't want us to look at.
[02:00:45.987 --> 02:00:57.178]  I think that they want us to be focused on Tucker and on Don Lemon.
[02:00:57.178 --> 02:00:57.778]  Are you there?
[02:00:57.778 --> 02:00:58.119]  Hello?
[02:00:58.119 --> 02:01:00.861]  I sure am!
[02:01:00.861 --> 02:01:04.925]  Yeah, I think that the war in Ukraine and the ramping up that they're doing...
[02:01:07.001 --> 02:01:09.482]  They don't, that's what they don't want us to look at.
[02:01:09.482 --> 02:01:15.885]  Well, I agree with you that Don Lemon had no viewers and that he didn't matter and CNN was already planning to get rid of him so they just did that at the same time.
[02:01:15.885 --> 02:01:20.187]  In the name of, quote, you know, damping down the news and making it less, quote, radical.
[02:01:20.187 --> 02:01:24.549]  But with Tucker, he was one of the leading, if not the leading voice, hammering against the war.
[02:01:24.549 --> 02:01:27.790]  So they were getting ready to get rid of him because of what he was doing.
[02:01:27.790 --> 02:01:28.870]  Absolutely.
[02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:29.951]  Absolutely.
[02:01:29.951 --> 02:01:34.533]  And they would rather have us looking at what a scandal it is that he's been fired
[02:01:35.209 --> 02:01:36.990]  Then what they are doing in Ukraine.
[02:01:36.990 --> 02:01:43.673]  So I just, I want to say God bless America and God bless Tucker Carlson.
[02:01:43.673 --> 02:01:47.395]  God bless you, Mr. Jones, and God bless my brother, Travis.
[02:01:47.395 --> 02:01:50.277]  God bless you, Terry, from Wisconsin.
[02:01:50.277 --> 02:01:53.218]  Andrew in New York, go ahead and thanks for calling.
[02:01:53.218 --> 02:02:02.263]  InfoWars, I think it's a good thing that they've been like building up all these different news websites like Grumble and
[02:02:03.730 --> 02:02:09.694]  Uh, Bandai Video and all these other ones, because, like, Fox is pretty much like a globalist, like, operation.
[02:02:09.694 --> 02:02:23.382]  Like, um, in the election, they called Arizona early in 2020, and then, uh, they basically, you know, they have a lot of control over their, like, news hosts then.
[02:02:23.382 --> 02:02:32.088]  Like, you were even saying, like, with Tucker, like, they had, Tucker had to have, like, extra freedom to say what he wanted more than, like, other people.
[02:02:33.464 --> 02:02:39.131]  Yeah, like back when, after the 2020 election, they fired, uh, like, Lou Dodson.
[02:02:39.131 --> 02:02:41.113]  I think, like, Chris Regan.
[02:02:41.113 --> 02:02:42.415]  Yeah, this is a purge.
[02:02:42.415 --> 02:02:46.439]  Getting rid of, getting rid of anybody that opposes the globalist agenda.
[02:02:46.439 --> 02:02:47.440]  Absolutely.
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:50.925]  But, that's why they have to have internet censorship as well, because they know Tucker will start his own thing.
[02:02:52.146 --> 02:02:55.508]  That's why it's up to the people to support independent media and promote it.
[02:02:55.508 --> 02:02:56.749]  That's what gets around all this.
[02:02:56.749 --> 02:02:58.309]  That's why you are the answer.
[02:02:58.309 --> 02:02:59.150]  You are everything.
[02:02:59.150 --> 02:03:00.471]  Thank you, Andrew.
[02:03:00.471 --> 02:03:02.031]  Let's play a short clip.
[02:03:02.031 --> 02:03:03.932]  The full clip's at Bandot Video.
[02:03:03.932 --> 02:03:04.993]  In fact, the full speech is there.
[02:03:04.993 --> 02:03:06.634]  It was Heritage Foundation's speech.
[02:03:06.634 --> 02:03:11.816]  But here, reportedly, is what made Murdoch go into a rage Friday and decide to go ahead and fire him now.
[02:03:11.816 --> 02:03:13.938]  My intel is he was going to fire him very soon.
[02:03:13.938 --> 02:03:15.538]  Here it is.
[02:03:15.538 --> 02:03:18.240]  And evil is characterized by their opposites.
[02:03:19.454 --> 02:03:26.298]  Violence, hate, disorder, division, disorganization, and filth.
[02:03:26.298 --> 02:03:36.023]  So if you are all in on the things that produce the latter basket of outcomes, what you're really advocating for is evil.
[02:03:36.023 --> 02:03:37.644]  That's just true.
[02:03:37.644 --> 02:03:42.707]  Those are manifestations of some larger force acting upon us.
[02:03:42.707 --> 02:03:45.468]  It's just so obvious.
[02:03:45.468 --> 02:03:46.629]  It's completely obvious.
[02:03:47.719 --> 02:03:55.126]  And even I have concluded it might be worth taking just 10 minutes out of your busy schedule to say a prayer for the future.
[02:03:55.126 --> 02:03:59.269]  And I hope you will.
[02:03:59.269 --> 02:04:02.132]  By the way, that's only 45 seconds.
[02:04:02.132 --> 02:04:03.833]  I want to do a 15 second intro to that.
[02:04:03.833 --> 02:04:10.439]  I'm going to run it as a radio ad, a TV ad for the next year or 10 years, however long we're still on air.
[02:04:10.439 --> 02:04:11.540]  Because that's it.
[02:04:14.079 --> 02:04:21.802]  The knowledge, the science proves what the ancient culture said, that there's all this unseen, there's all these energies, there's all these different forces.
[02:04:21.802 --> 02:04:31.386]  And you have to open yourself up and call on good, call on God, to touch you and decide to resonate with that, like plugging a plug into a wall.
[02:04:31.386 --> 02:04:34.207]  You have to say, God, I want to be good, help me.
[02:04:34.207 --> 02:04:37.128]  Because God's a free will God.
[02:04:37.128 --> 02:04:38.488]  The devil's not.
[02:04:38.488 --> 02:04:40.069]  The devil tries to take you over and manipulate.
[02:04:41.149 --> 02:04:44.610]  So we have to do this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:46.311]  We have to call on God.
[02:04:46.311 --> 02:04:54.054]  There are no atheists in foxholes, and that's why they finally said too much and fired Tucker, because he called on us to call on God.
[02:04:54.054 --> 02:04:55.435]  Let's all call on God.
[02:04:55.435 --> 02:04:56.275]  Let's all pray.
[02:04:59.076 --> 02:05:04.098]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[02:05:04.098 --> 02:05:06.259]  We made it even stronger.
[02:05:06.259 --> 02:05:10.001]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:05:10.001 --> 02:05:16.223]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:05:16.223 --> 02:05:22.986]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:05:22.986 --> 02:05:24.407]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:05:25.067 --> 02:05:38.137]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:05:38.137 --> 02:05:40.138]  It is the super fuel.
[02:05:40.138 --> 02:05:41.599]  RainForce Plus is great.
[02:05:41.599 --> 02:05:42.460]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:43.421]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:05:43.421 --> 02:05:44.601]  They go good with this.
[02:05:44.601 --> 02:05:46.643]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:05:47.361 --> 02:05:48.843]  This is the Boss.
[02:05:48.843 --> 02:05:49.565]  TurboForce.
[02:05:49.565 --> 02:05:50.606]  Back in stock.
[02:05:50.606 --> 02:05:51.628]  Discounted.
[02:05:51.628 --> 02:05:53.331]  M4Store.com.
[02:05:53.331 --> 02:05:54.212]  More power.
[02:05:54.212 --> 02:05:55.214]  More strength.
[02:05:55.214 --> 02:05:55.694]  More energy.
[02:06:09.183 --> 02:06:17.645]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:06:22.507 --> 02:06:25.429]  First off, my name's Bob Fletcher.
[02:06:25.429 --> 02:06:42.364]  It's interesting that they call for hearings after we ourselves were the ones that generated our appearance here to the committee that failed to hear us after we expended many thousands of bucks out of our pockets to get out here from several different parts of the country.
[02:06:42.364 --> 02:06:44.146]  It's interesting, they're calling it
[02:06:44.446 --> 02:07:02.400]  Now an inquirer requesting an inquiry into the militia groups as opposed to the title, which was to be the Militia Movement Across America, which would have been the title of the little Senate meeting that we were to have today, okay?
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:03.340]  So that's interesting.
[02:07:03.340 --> 02:07:06.082]  Obviously, it's politics as usual in Washington, D.C.
[02:07:07.163 --> 02:07:13.412]  Uh, to, uh, take one thing, uh, drop a few colors of, uh, of, uh, black into the paint and change it around.
[02:07:13.412 --> 02:07:17.998]  Of course, normally it's whitewashed, this time it's, uh, it's being turned in the other direction.
[02:07:17.998 --> 02:07:20.842]  The, um, uh, the idea, first off...
[02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:33.633]  The idea that there's more to be feared from American patriots that love the Constitution as opposed to the people, the ATF and the FBI.
[02:07:33.633 --> 02:07:40.922]  First off, there's not, to my knowledge, been any at all major criminal activity by any patriot group at all.
[02:07:40.922 --> 02:07:41.462]  Period.
[02:07:41.462 --> 02:07:42.003]  Done.
[02:07:42.003 --> 02:07:42.664]  End of story.
[02:07:44.076 --> 02:07:59.443]  And I can give you a list of so many abuses, including dead people, and drug smuggling, and murder, and assassination by those three and four letter combination agencies out of this town right here, that you wouldn't even have enough time to cover it at a press conference, you know?
[02:07:59.443 --> 02:08:06.486]  So maybe Mr. Schumer needs to pick up one of these packages that includes the Constitution, and he can get himself back on track.
[02:08:08.379 --> 02:08:15.085]  I'm afraid the Constitution, folks, is the single mandate of the militia patriot groups across America.
[02:08:15.085 --> 02:08:21.350]  It's the preservation of the Constitution of America, and we are losing it literally on a weekly basis.
[02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:30.318]  And the abuses of executive orders, which are dictatorial in nature, and basically constitutionally incorrect, obviously, are completely out of hand.
[02:08:30.318 --> 02:08:33.000]  That's like 28 years ago.
[02:08:36.693 --> 02:08:43.976]  Bob Fletcher will be with us for the next hour and 50 minutes or so, almost in the whole fourth hour today.
[02:08:43.976 --> 02:09:02.583]  And I was literally a month ago on air talking about all the great patriots that warned us about this that have been vindicated and I was listening to some of the names and then I literally had a dream about two, three weeks ago where I was sitting around like a coffee table or a breakfast table with Ted Gunderson and Red Beckman and
[02:09:03.598 --> 02:09:04.198]  Bob Fletcher
[02:09:26.724 --> 02:09:29.946]  Goes back to Barry Goldwater, you know, and then Ron Paul.
[02:09:29.946 --> 02:09:32.147]  All these great people that warned of this.
[02:09:32.147 --> 02:09:33.727]  You think Alex Jones has been vindicated?
[02:09:33.727 --> 02:09:35.408]  You think Alex Jones is right?
[02:09:35.408 --> 02:09:35.828]  Wow.
[02:09:35.828 --> 02:09:36.529]  Bob Fletcher.
[02:09:37.659 --> 02:09:58.597]  And his story's amazing, but you know, when he's been on the show over a decade ago, sometimes, he would get into the CIA, and then went and used his company as a front group, and how he found out about it through a re-encounter, and how it went down the rabbit trail, and then, you know, proving weather weapons, which is all out in the open now, and the FEMA camps, and the planned lockdowns with poison shots, and pandemics.
[02:09:58.597 --> 02:10:02.401]  We can talk about all the stuff he was right about 30 years ago, 25 years ago, or
[02:10:05.316 --> 02:10:09.437]  This is a smart guy at 80 plus years old, still as sharp as he ever was.
[02:10:09.437 --> 02:10:17.279]  What is this great mind of Bob Fletcher thinking is coming now and what's currently happening and what is it like to be so vindicated?
[02:10:17.279 --> 02:10:19.079]  I know it's, for me, a sick feeling.
[02:10:19.079 --> 02:10:21.120]  We wish we could have stopped it.
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:24.320]  Businessman, investor, film producer, speaker, and author.
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:28.141]  After years of business professional career, Bob became involved in U.S.
[02:10:28.141 --> 02:10:31.022]  government top secret covert arms sales, not even knowing it.
[02:10:31.994 --> 02:10:37.696]  In a simple business merger, Bob merged his toy manufacturing company with a company that imported watches.
[02:10:37.696 --> 02:10:40.237]  The company was called Vista USA Inc.
[02:10:40.237 --> 02:10:42.578]  and was a covert operational front for U.S.
[02:10:42.578 --> 02:10:44.659]  arms sales and covert mercenary training.
[02:10:44.659 --> 02:10:51.902]  Eventually, the owner, Gary Best, attempted to recruit Fletcher into the business of arms sales, and Fletcher refused to become involved.
[02:10:51.902 --> 02:11:00.165]  Later, Bob became a witness in the Iran-Contra mess, and he then became an investigator, assisting several House and Senate investigations.
[02:11:00.165 --> 02:11:01.046]  Since then, Bob has been
[02:11:01.766 --> 02:11:02.866]  I think so.
[02:11:22.452 --> 02:11:30.536]  And it's research that needs to get out to the world, and we need to really remember the people that back when almost nobody knew what was going on, there was Bob Fletcher and others.
[02:11:30.536 --> 02:11:34.958]  I think about these folks all the time, and he's here with us.
[02:11:34.958 --> 02:11:37.319]  So, Bob, we're about five minutes to break.
[02:11:37.319 --> 02:11:40.681]  You can start wherever you want at the beginning or current.
[02:11:40.681 --> 02:11:43.142]  I kind of want to get your view on the world today and everything that's going on.
[02:11:43.142 --> 02:11:46.044]  We can go back to the start and walk through what's happened.
[02:11:46.044 --> 02:11:50.166]  But, wow, what is it like to be vindicated in spades?
[02:11:51.926 --> 02:12:06.591]  Well, the problem is my predictions, which were so really horrible, was that we were going to be taken over by the New World Order, One World Government.
[02:12:06.591 --> 02:12:12.314]  It goes back 70, actually 72, 70 years.
[02:12:12.314 --> 02:12:18.776]  Actually, people don't realize that term, New World Order, One World Government.
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:24.344]  Which is what we are seeing today out of Washington, D.C.
[02:12:24.344 --> 02:12:26.646]  That's what we are faced with.
[02:12:26.646 --> 02:12:29.628]  And how we're going to handle it, I'm not sure.
[02:12:29.628 --> 02:12:44.640]  But that term was the term that Adolf Hitler used in 1938 when he started his junk, his crazy idea of a one world government, new world order.
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:46.902]  That's what he called it himself.
[02:12:46.902 --> 02:12:47.983]  Adolf Hitler's term.
[02:12:48.624 --> 02:13:00.135]  And it's been carried on by bad persons in government who don't care at all about the Constitution or the freedom at all, because it doesn't work.
[02:13:00.135 --> 02:13:04.079]  And the New World Order, I discovered it, gosh, 30 years ago.
[02:13:06.891 --> 02:13:20.119]  I got involved in, and it's too complex, we'll get back relative to some of the crazy interfacings of all of my inquiries, my investigations.
[02:13:20.119 --> 02:13:29.766]  By the way, I actually had completed about 15, actually I did probably 19 altogether.
[02:13:29.766 --> 02:13:31.347]  A lot of my reports
[02:13:32.339 --> 02:13:39.106]  Started out originally when they were trying to attack, quote unquote, the militia movement.
[02:13:39.106 --> 02:13:41.108]  That was when I got some attention.
[02:13:41.108 --> 02:13:54.481]  But what I did, which was a little slick of me, I guess, I ended up, over the last 30 years, befriending the bad guys in government, as well as the good guys,
[02:13:55.427 --> 02:14:00.511]  And neither side knew where I was at any given time.
[02:14:00.511 --> 02:14:10.538]  So I became supported by people, major New World Order people, for example, Senator John Kerry.
[02:14:10.538 --> 02:14:14.201]  I became close with him, during a period of time.
[02:14:14.201 --> 02:14:20.586]  I knew... And by the way, you're not just saying that, we have the CIA on Iran-Contra.
[02:14:20.586 --> 02:14:23.968]  Yeah, well, and of course, yes, go ahead, sure.
[02:14:23.968 --> 02:14:24.689]  No, no, go ahead.
[02:14:25.686 --> 02:14:27.907]  Yeah, okay.
[02:14:27.907 --> 02:14:41.096]  Yeah, and what happened actually, for example, with that investigation, with looking into the militia as we were stating that we were bad guys.
[02:14:41.096 --> 02:14:52.103]  Of course, none of those people even realize that the militia, that term, and that group that existed is what created
[02:14:52.808 --> 02:14:57.810]  The separation from the King in Britain that began America.
[02:14:57.810 --> 02:15:04.654]  The term Militia was prior to the Constitution and it was now the bad guys.
[02:15:04.654 --> 02:15:12.678]  I use this kind of vague terminology to use the idea of the bad guys and good guys.
[02:15:12.678 --> 02:15:21.762]  But that's rather simplistic and I have to point something out now for the folks that haven't realized this.
[02:15:22.734 --> 02:15:29.616]  It's not Democrat bad guys and Republicans all good guys.
[02:15:29.616 --> 02:15:40.239]  The right, what we refer to the right, and they're doing all the time with the separation of Republican versus Democrats, that's not what it is.
[02:15:40.239 --> 02:15:44.820]  What it amounts to is the reality that we have major
[02:15:45.586 --> 02:15:51.791]  Corrupted personalities in both the Republican and the Democratic side.
[02:15:51.791 --> 02:16:02.439]  The separation, just using those, the left and the right, and saying Democrats are the leftists and the Republicans being on the right.
[02:16:02.439 --> 02:16:12.868]  The amount of criminality at the highest levels that I discovered, and I ended up working with whistleblowers,
[02:16:14.344 --> 02:16:18.766]  At the highest levels of our government for the last 30 years.
[02:16:18.766 --> 02:16:22.467]  Now I've reached, I'm 82 years old now.
[02:16:22.467 --> 02:16:28.289]  I've got a multitude of non-operative problems physically.
[02:16:28.289 --> 02:16:31.811]  So whatever, that's my case situation.
[02:16:31.811 --> 02:16:35.912]  And I realize it and it's amazing.
[02:16:35.912 --> 02:16:39.714]  People always saying, well, gee, you don't look like you're 82 years old.
[02:16:39.714 --> 02:16:39.894]  Well,
[02:16:40.663 --> 02:16:44.285]  I am 82 years old and I'm about to be gone.
[02:16:44.285 --> 02:16:52.148]  I've been hit, professionally hit, three times by assassination attempts.
[02:16:52.148 --> 02:16:56.029]  We won't go, we can go back later on, we'll talk.
[02:16:56.029 --> 02:17:03.912]  Yeah, for folks that don't know, in the old days, now they just kill you politically most of the time, when you were doing the stuff you were doing, they killed people on a routine basis.
[02:17:03.912 --> 02:17:04.793]  I remember my dad's
[02:17:06.209 --> 02:17:09.190]  They called him my dad's uncle, but he was really my dad's cousin.
[02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:11.852]  Was an army special operations guy that went around.
[02:17:11.852 --> 02:17:13.112]  His job was killing people.
[02:17:13.112 --> 02:17:17.954]  I remember he read my first book in like 2002, and he said, I'm surprised you're not dead.
[02:17:17.954 --> 02:17:20.035]  We used to kill people for a lot less than this.
[02:17:20.035 --> 02:17:26.138]  But they've kind of shifted from killing people to just killing the masses of people with shots and things.
[02:17:26.138 --> 02:17:30.500]  But yeah, when you were speaking out, they killed people.
[02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:32.361]  Oh, they were killed.
[02:17:32.361 --> 02:17:34.222]  I'll tell you what, the numbers
[02:17:35.876 --> 02:17:39.177]  The numbers of dead people are mind-boggling.
[02:17:39.177 --> 02:17:46.119]  I had a fella I just ran into the other day way up here, and I'm in Never Never Land.
[02:17:46.119 --> 02:17:48.720]  I'm up in Idaho.
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:18:02.405]  Fortunately, we're in a little, like a 90-mile square up here where the weather, with all the stuff that's going on presently with the weather, we're kind of
[02:18:03.354 --> 02:18:04.855]  Don't get a heck of a lot of that.
[02:18:04.855 --> 02:18:15.042]  There's an area in Idaho, I've looked it up, there's an area in those valleys that basically is amazing and just blocks the weather.
[02:18:15.042 --> 02:18:16.223]  I think that's what it is.
[02:18:16.223 --> 02:18:19.245]  It's just everything comes in.
[02:18:19.245 --> 02:18:26.170]  We've had a couple of bad snow situations, but we're not getting any of that crazy stuff that's taking place.
[02:18:26.170 --> 02:18:31.694]  And I understand in studies and dealing with
[02:18:32.907 --> 02:18:38.491]  People that are above top secret whistleblowers.
[02:18:38.491 --> 02:18:53.582]  For 30 years, I had gotten into a point where I was big mouth and had either the lack of knowledge to keep my mouth shut, but I was out running around.
[02:18:53.582 --> 02:19:00.727]  And what happened was, over the last 30 years, just making kind of keep this in general terms, the specific numbers of
[02:19:01.645 --> 02:19:09.831]  Uh, of information that I had received and I had put into many reports myself.
[02:19:09.831 --> 02:19:18.397]  Matter of fact, I ended up, I'm distracting myself here, but I ended up doing a multitude of investigative reports
[02:19:19.217 --> 02:19:38.922]  At the request of different Senators and Congressmen, Congressional, people from the Pentagon, people from a multitude of the... And for radio listeners that weren't around when I was around 30 years ago or watching us on TV, we're showing all this on C-SPAN, all these hearings, you on national TV.
[02:19:38.922 --> 02:19:42.323]  There's a war inside these agencies because you were willing to risk your life.
[02:19:42.323 --> 02:19:44.503]  I think I'm not speaking out of school.
[02:19:44.503 --> 02:19:47.664]  You were being used as a conduit within their wars.
[02:19:49.230 --> 02:19:59.096]  Yes, and what happened is, what I did myself, was I ended up befriending good guys and bad guys.
[02:19:59.096 --> 02:20:07.962]  And I knew what they were, who they were, what they were at that time, and they were utilizing myself
[02:20:08.701 --> 02:20:17.190]  Again, talking about, and for the lack of a better terminology than just good guys and bad guys, and that's what it's all coming down to anyhow.
[02:20:17.190 --> 02:20:25.919]  The world government stuff, New World Order, goes back so many years, and it's, it's, they've punched forward.
[02:20:25.919 --> 02:20:27.721]  We are now witnessing it.
[02:20:28.527 --> 02:20:31.289]  What I said would happen.
[02:20:31.289 --> 02:20:37.833]  And unfortunately, we've been unable to sidetrack it properly.
[02:20:37.833 --> 02:20:41.136]  People just don't believe, they have no idea.
[02:20:41.136 --> 02:20:48.200]  Some of the folks, the amount of death, murders, assassinations, they tried to hit me three times.
[02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:50.822]  Professional assassinations.
[02:20:50.822 --> 02:20:56.486]  My left shoulder, right over here, which is the right side for you guys, my left shoulder
[02:20:57.245 --> 02:21:06.313]  Presently, today, and for 30 years, I was blown up in Los Angeles when I was living in L.A.
[02:21:06.313 --> 02:21:07.454]  at the time.
[02:21:07.454 --> 02:21:15.761]  I was hit with a what literally was a microwave weapon, and they used it on a lot of folks.
[02:21:15.761 --> 02:21:18.243]  And is that what the Havana Syndrome is?
[02:21:19.668 --> 02:21:21.149]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:21:21.149 --> 02:21:28.713]  No, this is a physical microwave weapon in the configuration of the equivalent of a rifle.
[02:21:29.488 --> 02:21:38.195]  Yeah, for those that don't know, they have microwave guns in the movie District 19, and they fire them and it explodes people.
[02:21:38.195 --> 02:21:42.358]  What it does, or it's supposed to do, is it gives you a heart attack.
[02:21:42.358 --> 02:21:48.182]  Well, I talked to Marines 20 years ago in secret projects with robots and all, and they had microwave guns then.
[02:21:48.182 --> 02:21:51.185]  I thought of you when they said that, because they have that.
[02:21:52.634 --> 02:21:55.696]  Yeah, and what took place, I was living in L.A.
[02:21:55.696 --> 02:21:56.857]  at the time.
[02:21:56.857 --> 02:22:17.150]  I was full-time, and by the way, my investigative work, it ended up being something like, I literally, until a couple of years ago, and again it's just age, you know, your rheostat gets turned down to the left by the powers to be once you reach a certain point in time.
[02:22:17.985 --> 02:22:31.469]  And I was on a couple of years, about two years ago, was when I really just had been, because of my physical and mental capabilities, just becoming old.
[02:22:31.469 --> 02:22:33.770]  You can't do a hell of a lot about that.
[02:22:33.770 --> 02:22:42.272]  But anyhow, what I had done successfully was I ended up
[02:22:43.041 --> 02:22:54.915]  First off, by befriending and being crazy enough to come out in front and point fingers at Presidents of the United States, Vice Presidents of the United States, etc.
[02:22:54.915 --> 02:22:55.035]  etc.
[02:22:56.352 --> 02:23:10.557]  And I had some, every time I did some type of an expose that became public, I had about 15 DVDs of separate reports.
[02:23:10.557 --> 02:23:12.038]  They were all great.
[02:23:12.038 --> 02:23:25.343]  They ended up being unbelievable because what happened once I started getting the notoriety a little bit nationally, what happened, I started having
[02:23:26.556 --> 02:23:47.173]  People contact me from above top secret levels and they were whistleblowers that stepped forward and I would be contacted and somebody would say and I had a website at that time etc etc which by the way was blown up.
[02:23:47.173 --> 02:23:52.738]  I mean they erased the heart they blew my computer almost to nothing.
[02:23:53.314 --> 02:23:54.857]  They came in from the outside.
[02:23:54.857 --> 02:23:59.906]  And I want to talk about all that, Bob, but the time we've got here, the time we've got here, you're currently...
[02:24:01.127 --> 02:24:02.648]  We'll get into the whole history of it.
[02:24:02.648 --> 02:24:12.477]  Your current music, the New World Order, world government, eat the bugs, universal basic incomes, cashless societies, forced injections, lockdowns, FEMA camps, the name of the vaccine, the name of the virus.
[02:24:12.477 --> 02:24:16.100]  I mean, it's all happened, but it looks like it didn't go as well as they wanted.
[02:24:16.100 --> 02:24:17.121]  They had to back off for now.
[02:24:17.121 --> 02:24:19.042]  Now they're saying a new virus is going to be released.
[02:24:19.042 --> 02:24:21.244]  I mean, now, look forward.
[02:24:21.244 --> 02:24:25.287]  Bob Fletcher, you know he's got the documents and top secret research and all that.
[02:24:25.287 --> 02:24:26.408]  You're a smart guy.
[02:24:26.408 --> 02:24:28.030]  How's it going for the New World Order?
[02:24:28.030 --> 02:24:29.351]  What do you make of the current landscape?
[02:24:30.646 --> 02:24:39.049]  Well, it's actually, of course, the current landscape is really bad, unfortunately.
[02:24:39.049 --> 02:24:45.771]  You know, we now have that movement and the movement itself.
[02:24:45.771 --> 02:24:50.993]  And again, I use simplistic terms, bad guys and good guys, because that's a reality.
[02:24:50.993 --> 02:24:53.034]  They're satanic.
[02:24:53.034 --> 02:24:56.775]  The bad side, the negative side is satanic.
[02:24:56.775 --> 02:24:58.816]  And I worked, I had
[02:24:59.592 --> 02:25:08.775]  I have to just try to kind of compress all this because then we'll have to get back and we'll get into a whole multitude of things that will blow your mind.
[02:25:08.775 --> 02:25:24.020]  The people, the stuff that I got, and I knew, I knew ahead of time that they were going to take down the Twin Towers and or that we were going to have the COVID.
[02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:27.802]  I wasn't sure which one was going to come first or last.
[02:25:27.802 --> 02:25:28.662]  I predicted
[02:25:29.973 --> 02:25:32.294]  And again, I'm not, you know, these are not predictions.
[02:25:32.294 --> 02:25:36.275]  I'm not some psychic kind of space ranger type person.
[02:25:36.275 --> 02:25:44.878]  My predictions were based on reality of definitive information that I totally had on every one of my exposés.
[02:25:46.261 --> 02:25:59.168]  And by the way, I did 19 random reports for senators, congressmen, congressional hearings, the back end, this one and that one, and where something came up when I was in one of the two of the hearings myself.
[02:25:59.168 --> 02:25:59.689]  No, I know.
[02:25:59.689 --> 02:26:03.311]  Before I even got on air, because I've been on air like 29 years, your reports were everywhere.
[02:26:03.311 --> 02:26:13.376]  So listeners are getting introduced to you on that, but picking your big brain, I'm asking you, we're seeing, I think, from beta to operational now, everything else was beta before.
[02:26:13.376 --> 02:26:14.717]  Is this operational, New World Order?
[02:26:16.685 --> 02:26:22.270]  Oh yes, yeah, and here's the problem.
[02:26:22.270 --> 02:26:29.375]  Originally the New World Order, which again, this concept came out of Adolf Hitler, came out of Hitler.
[02:26:29.375 --> 02:26:36.040]  That was what he called his existence, his dictatorship, when he moved in 1938.
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:44.227]  Now I'm going to tell you something that people can look up on Google without getting into a whole bunch of complex stuff.
[02:26:44.227 --> 02:26:45.528]  If you go on Google,
[02:26:46.918 --> 02:26:52.121]  And look up Prescott Bush.
[02:26:52.121 --> 02:26:57.303]  Prescott Bush was the father of G.H.W.
[02:26:57.303 --> 02:27:00.504]  Bush, the grandfather of G.W.
[02:27:00.504 --> 02:27:06.147]  Bush, and they are Satanists.
[02:27:06.147 --> 02:27:07.068]  Period.
[02:27:07.068 --> 02:27:10.769]  Now, if you look up Prescott Bush, a lot of people don't know this name.
[02:27:10.769 --> 02:27:11.930]  You can just go on Google.
[02:27:12.575 --> 02:27:20.117]  And you will be amazed because it will show you that he had the bank, and I think his partner was Averill Harriman.
[02:27:20.117 --> 02:27:23.917]  Yeah, it was Brown Brother Harriman in Lower Manhattan.
[02:27:23.917 --> 02:27:24.497]  Right.
[02:27:24.497 --> 02:27:33.859]  He had a bank, they had a bank in the United States of America in 1938 that funded Adolf Hitler.
[02:27:33.859 --> 02:27:36.620]  That bank was shut down after the war.
[02:27:38.315 --> 02:27:40.275]  And they were completely closed.
[02:27:40.275 --> 02:27:44.676]  They were dismantled.
[02:27:44.676 --> 02:27:46.797]  But it was Prescott Bush.
[02:27:46.797 --> 02:27:51.278]  This is a guy that is the father of GHW.
[02:27:51.278 --> 02:27:53.518]  And by the way, this is not your opinion.
[02:27:53.518 --> 02:27:57.639]  Prescott, Senator Bush, they had the McCormick-Dixton Committee hearings.
[02:27:57.639 --> 02:27:59.039]  They had the U.S.
[02:27:59.039 --> 02:28:01.260]  military secretly go around and kill a bunch of Nazis in the U.S.
[02:28:01.260 --> 02:28:02.580]  that were working for them.
[02:28:02.580 --> 02:28:05.280]  But then they left the Bushes alone.
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:07.861]  Yeah, though the point was, quite literally,
[02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:18.522]  It was the original 1938 funds came from Prescott Bush, the father of G.H.W.
[02:28:18.522 --> 02:28:20.223]  Bush.
[02:28:20.223 --> 02:28:24.284]  And now you have to understand something else now that connects completely into this.
[02:28:24.284 --> 02:28:38.327]  I don't want to get into all of that too much, but it's something that everybody, everybody that's listening and watching can go to the computer, punch in Prescott Bush, put slash Adolf Hitler.
[02:28:39.671 --> 02:28:42.212]  And then punch it up and see what Google presents.
[02:28:42.212 --> 02:28:45.274]  They're going to show you where he actually lost his bank.
[02:28:45.274 --> 02:28:47.195]  They were shut down after the war.
[02:28:47.195 --> 02:28:52.398]  He was charged with aiding and abetting and financing Adolf Hitler beginning in 1938.
[02:28:52.398 --> 02:28:54.459]  All right, Bob Fletcher, stay there.
[02:28:54.459 --> 02:28:54.959]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:58.513 --> 02:29:03.534]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[02:29:03.534 --> 02:29:05.695]  We made it even stronger.
[02:29:05.695 --> 02:29:09.436]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:29:09.436 --> 02:29:13.677]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:29:13.677 --> 02:29:14.377]  It's not just
[02:29:17.678 --> 02:29:22.742]  Wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:29:22.742 --> 02:29:24.503]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:29:24.503 --> 02:29:37.573]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:29:37.573 --> 02:29:39.575]  It is the super fuel.
[02:29:39.575 --> 02:29:41.056]  RainForce Plus is great.
[02:29:41.056 --> 02:29:41.917]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[02:29:41.917 --> 02:29:42.877]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:29:42.877 --> 02:29:44.058]  They go good with this.
[02:29:44.058 --> 02:29:46.080]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:29:46.798 --> 02:29:48.280]  This is the boss.
[02:29:48.280 --> 02:29:49.020]  TurboForce.
[02:29:49.020 --> 02:29:50.041]  Back in stock.
[02:29:50.041 --> 02:29:51.042]  Discounted.
[02:29:51.042 --> 02:29:52.764]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:29:52.764 --> 02:29:53.645]  More power.
[02:29:53.645 --> 02:29:54.646]  More strength.
[02:29:54.646 --> 02:29:58.229]  More energy.
[02:29:58.229 --> 02:30:01.632]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:30:06.516 --> 02:30:07.857]  I want you all to know something.
[02:30:07.857 --> 02:30:09.819]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:30:09.819 --> 02:30:13.361]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[02:30:13.361 --> 02:30:16.484]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:30:16.484 --> 02:30:20.747]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:30:20.747 --> 02:30:22.949]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:30:22.949 --> 02:30:26.471]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:30:26.471 --> 02:30:29.914]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:30:30.194 --> 02:30:33.055]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:30:33.055 --> 02:30:34.096]  Years ago.
[02:30:34.096 --> 02:30:38.158]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[02:30:38.158 --> 02:30:40.679]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:30:40.679 --> 02:30:43.140]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:30:43.140 --> 02:30:46.262]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:30:46.262 --> 02:30:50.904]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:30:59.591 --> 02:31:02.734]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:31:02.734 --> 02:31:05.016]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:31:05.016 --> 02:31:08.959]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:31:08.959 --> 02:31:17.046]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:31:17.046 --> 02:31:25.693]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:31:26.698 --> 02:31:30.360]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:31:30.360 --> 02:31:36.123]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:31:36.123 --> 02:31:39.165]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:31:39.165 --> 02:31:46.229]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[02:31:46.229 --> 02:31:47.410]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[02:31:48.091 --> 02:31:52.419]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[02:31:52.419 --> 02:31:57.368]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsaw.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:31:57.368 --> 02:31:58.130]  Please take action now.
[02:31:58.735 --> 02:32:06.941]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[02:32:06.941 --> 02:32:08.403]  That is a hellish future.
[02:32:08.403 --> 02:32:17.810]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're trying to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarshore.com.
[02:32:17.810 --> 02:32:23.394]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[02:32:23.394 --> 02:32:25.376]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:32:25.956 --> 02:32:31.338]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowarsware.com.
[02:32:31.338 --> 02:32:35.279]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:32:35.279 --> 02:32:41.161]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[02:32:41.161 --> 02:32:43.242]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[02:32:44.042 --> 02:32:45.103]  Or unsigned copies.
[02:32:45.103 --> 02:32:55.452]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWarshow.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[02:32:55.452 --> 02:32:58.134]  This is an InfoWar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[02:33:13.613 --> 02:33:14.733]  Welcome back!
[02:33:14.733 --> 02:33:19.734]  Bob Fletcher, our guest.
[02:33:19.734 --> 02:33:22.395]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:22.395 --> 02:33:28.857]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:28.857 --> 02:33:34.018]  You know, a zygote forms, and the sperm makes it through, it penetrates the egg.
[02:33:34.018 --> 02:33:37.318]  The egg decides to let the sperm in.
[02:33:37.318 --> 02:33:39.339]  It has that right magic.
[02:33:40.660 --> 02:33:50.607]  And if you go back to the resistance to this movement, as Fletcher says, it really goes back to the 1850s and British intelligence, and they were funding super science.
[02:33:50.607 --> 02:33:53.208]  It was all theoretical then, but they developed it.
[02:33:53.208 --> 02:33:57.531]  And if you talk about the New World Order, Hitler gave speeches about the New World Order.
[02:33:57.531 --> 02:34:00.373]  He had a New World Order that was challenging the British Empire's New World Order.
[02:34:00.373 --> 02:34:01.174]  H.G.
[02:34:01.174 --> 02:34:04.676]  Wells, that wrote mainly science fiction, was one of the top-faving socialists.
[02:34:04.676 --> 02:34:10.440]  He also wrote the New World Order that was political about their socialist, communist world government.
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:16.405]  And Joseph Goebbels has come out even in mainline documents, and Hitler wanted to kill H.G.
[02:34:16.405 --> 02:34:17.807]  Wells.
[02:34:17.807 --> 02:34:21.851]  Because they saw him as their contemporary challenge.
[02:34:21.851 --> 02:34:26.595]  So they're not enemies in that they don't want basically the same thing, just different paths to that.
[02:34:26.595 --> 02:34:27.956]  So you have H.G.
[02:34:27.956 --> 02:34:32.160]  Wells right here, and you've got the Nazis, but forking off from the same thing.
[02:34:33.127 --> 02:34:34.568]  And that's the plan.
[02:34:34.568 --> 02:34:40.372]  So it's a new world order, a scientific takeover of humanity, and building this monstrosity.
[02:34:40.372 --> 02:34:47.037]  See, we're getting into Prescott Bush, AP, Reuters, London Guardian, Congressional hearings, semi-film, endgame.
[02:34:47.037 --> 02:34:54.102]  Smedley Butler, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, they're approaching to be the dictator with the Nazis, overthrow America, he turns against them.
[02:34:54.102 --> 02:34:54.722]  You know, the U.S.
[02:34:54.722 --> 02:34:58.385]  military secretly goes around and kills a bunch of Nazis right at the start of World War II.
[02:34:59.517 --> 02:35:01.679]  But then Prescott Bush is left alone.
[02:35:01.679 --> 02:35:03.240]  See, we're going down that thread for a reason.
[02:35:03.240 --> 02:35:05.322]  It's a great angle to go through.
[02:35:05.322 --> 02:35:11.027]  But I want to ask you about Tucker Carlson being fired and what happened with COVID and the Ukraine war.
[02:35:11.027 --> 02:35:13.830]  Because Fletcher, you've done all this great work in the past.
[02:35:13.830 --> 02:35:15.792]  And we're introducing here, people should search your name.
[02:35:16.212 --> 02:35:25.240]  A lot of it isn't on YouTube or Google, but you can go to C-SPAN, and that's where if you search terms, they have the actual archives of all the congressional hearings and press conferences, and it's incredible.
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:27.161]  And I ran Contra and everything else.
[02:35:27.161 --> 02:35:28.742]  When you're saying these things, it sounds wild.
[02:35:28.742 --> 02:35:32.465]  Like, I wrote secret reports for Congress, and I was in deep state wars.
[02:35:32.465 --> 02:35:33.666]  It's all true, folks.
[02:35:33.666 --> 02:35:34.587]  He was on the nightly news.
[02:35:34.587 --> 02:35:35.328]  He was all over the place.
[02:35:36.909 --> 02:35:37.970]  Okay, well the spooky thing is
[02:35:57.214 --> 02:36:05.702]  Uh, you know, and I, we'll go back and I'm going to make a, we're going to put something together on a secondary here.
[02:36:05.702 --> 02:36:20.456]  I'm going to make all of my reports, the bulk of the ones that I actually put down on DVDs and sold them, you know, to let them, made them available to the Patriots.
[02:36:23.090 --> 02:36:46.704]  But to compress what happened in my situation, I had a million dollar toy company back in the old days when if you started something in your basement and you turned it into a million dollar project, that was a success.
[02:36:46.704 --> 02:36:51.107]  It would have to be a couple of billion now, I guess, to even make the news.
[02:36:51.807 --> 02:36:56.509]  But I had created a toy that was extraordinarily unique.
[02:36:56.509 --> 02:37:02.450]  And my background prior to that is amazing also, and I won't get into that at all now.
[02:37:02.450 --> 02:37:07.072]  But I was a child performer on Broadway.
[02:37:07.608 --> 02:37:10.691]  When I was like 11 years old, I made more money.
[02:37:10.691 --> 02:37:13.973]  I was in two Broadway shows, Roger Hammerstein things.
[02:37:13.973 --> 02:37:18.877]  The Carousel was the name of one of them, and the other was Finian's Rainbow.
[02:37:18.877 --> 02:37:20.318]  I did that when I was 12.
[02:37:20.318 --> 02:37:22.540]  I paid my first Social Security.
[02:37:22.540 --> 02:37:27.704]  I was making more money than my father, God bless him, as a performer.
[02:37:27.704 --> 02:37:29.626]  And that goes way back, right?
[02:37:29.626 --> 02:37:35.991]  That started my life in terms of at least public exposure, I guess.
[02:37:37.337 --> 02:37:39.818]  That's something else altogether, Elaine.
[02:37:39.818 --> 02:37:40.479]  We'll get into that.
[02:37:40.479 --> 02:37:55.726]  But the point was that I had just a simple company, a good, actually was doing extraordinarily well, because it was an extraordinary, unique toy.
[02:37:55.726 --> 02:38:01.228]  And it was on television, just on the fact that it was so unusual.
[02:38:01.228 --> 02:38:02.369]  No, I've looked at it before.
[02:38:02.369 --> 02:38:02.809]  I forget.
[02:38:02.809 --> 02:38:03.529]  Tell us about the toy.
[02:38:03.529 --> 02:38:04.590]  We'll pull it up.
[02:38:05.700 --> 02:38:06.600]  Yeah.
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:08.481]  Okay, so anyhow.
[02:38:08.481 --> 02:38:11.862]  Tell us the name of the toy, we'll pull it up.
[02:38:11.862 --> 02:38:12.522]  What?
[02:38:12.522 --> 02:38:14.063]  Okay, excuse me, say that again.
[02:38:14.063 --> 02:38:17.704]  Tell us the name of the toy, we'll pull it up for viewers.
[02:38:17.704 --> 02:38:21.226]  Well, it's, they were spring animals.
[02:38:21.226 --> 02:38:27.548]  I have a bunch of, I have some DVDs because it was on network stuff and all that.
[02:38:28.704 --> 02:38:33.288]  I'll see that you get them, and then you'll have everything to deal with.
[02:38:33.288 --> 02:38:35.950]  Unfortunately, we're on DVD, so we can go from there.
[02:38:35.950 --> 02:38:39.272]  That's beside the point.
[02:38:39.272 --> 02:38:56.705]  Anyhow, the terrible thing that I discovered totally by accident, and I got into it, merged my company with a company, turned out to be a covert operation for what at that time was
[02:38:57.395 --> 02:39:01.916]  The Contra, I ran Contra's scandal.
[02:39:01.916 --> 02:39:06.238]  And they were trying to recruit me into the CIA.
[02:39:06.238 --> 02:39:18.202]  They even ended up classifying by the executive order, the toy company, Ronald Reagan under the direction of G.H.W.
[02:39:18.202 --> 02:39:21.063]  Bush, who was vice president with Reagan.
[02:39:21.063 --> 02:39:22.183]  And he's a bad guy.
[02:39:23.007 --> 02:39:26.310]  The entire families are bad guys, period.
[02:39:26.310 --> 02:39:29.413]  Like it or lump it, that's the story and it's proven.
[02:39:29.413 --> 02:39:33.396]  They're all involved with skull and bones.
[02:39:33.396 --> 02:39:35.839]  Senator John Kerry is involved with skull and bones.
[02:39:35.839 --> 02:39:41.123]  Yeah, let's speak to the Satanism, because the toy company and Iran Contra, everybody, people know about that.
[02:39:41.123 --> 02:39:46.608]  You're really smart about the future and the world, but let's talk about the Satanism you're discussing.
[02:39:46.608 --> 02:39:48.170]  Yeah, the Satanism
[02:39:50.094 --> 02:40:12.540]  And this is what I, one of the best things that I was able to do was I did get some extraordinary high-level whistleblowers and they would just contact me because they saw my stupid butt up on TV going to and trying to challenge all these people and that's a perfect picture right there.
[02:40:12.540 --> 02:40:18.102]  You know, the Bushes were all involved with the Skull and Bones.
[02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:23.021]  John Kerry was involved with the Skull and Bones.
[02:40:23.021 --> 02:40:26.163]  And John Kerry and I became quite close.
[02:40:26.163 --> 02:40:28.565]  I assisted him in a few things.
[02:40:28.565 --> 02:40:41.893]  And he ended up, I ran in Congress against a bad guy down in Orlando, Florida at one point in time.
[02:40:41.893 --> 02:40:46.336]  And his name was Bill McCollum, Congressman Bill McCollum.
[02:40:47.975 --> 02:40:57.740]  He ended up being a guy that was involved with the assassinations of Sonny Bono, who died on the ski slopes.
[02:40:57.740 --> 02:41:01.341]  He was assassinated and he was hit.
[02:41:01.341 --> 02:41:02.862]  He never ran into any tree.
[02:41:02.862 --> 02:41:08.965]  They dragged his body up against a tree, made it look like he had run into a tree.
[02:41:08.965 --> 02:41:13.127]  Sonny Bono was on a Christmas holiday, I believe it was in 89.
[02:41:15.174 --> 02:41:17.354]  He and I... Why did they kill Sonny Bono?
[02:41:17.354 --> 02:41:20.215]  He was really speaking out against the Deep State.
[02:41:20.215 --> 02:41:26.856]  They killed Sonny Bono because he started to... Let me back up.
[02:41:26.856 --> 02:41:33.258]  I was hired at one point in time by Manuel Noriega's lawyers.
[02:41:33.258 --> 02:41:34.938]  The lawyers from Manuel Noriega.
[02:41:34.938 --> 02:41:36.438]  They contacted me.
[02:41:36.438 --> 02:41:43.280]  They said, Mr. Fletcher... I was down in Atlanta or Orlando at the time still on the East Coast.
[02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:44.720]  They said, Mr. Fletcher,
[02:41:45.914 --> 02:41:55.316]  Can you show the connection between Manuel Noriega and the drug operations out of South America?
[02:41:55.316 --> 02:41:59.216]  Now, I'm going to tell people something right now.
[02:41:59.216 --> 02:42:00.817]  This is a reality.
[02:42:00.817 --> 02:42:10.978]  Anything that I say, I can not only prove it, but I can prove it beyond a doubt with actual videos, documentations, and statements, etc.
[02:42:10.978 --> 02:42:13.279]  by the people that were involved.
[02:42:13.279 --> 02:42:15.019]  The Bush family were running drugs.
[02:42:16.514 --> 02:42:33.243]  Up from the Iran, in the Iran Contra mess, they had an operation called Operation Watchtower that had used military forces to install signaling devices under, under, right under everybody's nose.
[02:42:33.243 --> 02:42:35.624]  It was called Operation Watchtower.
[02:42:35.624 --> 02:42:45.789]  And they had radar signals that would, that the aircraft coming up from South America filled with cocaine.
[02:42:46.969 --> 02:42:48.910]  I'm talking filled with cocaine.
[02:42:48.910 --> 02:42:49.831]  Could use his beacons.
[02:42:49.831 --> 02:42:51.892]  Yeah, that came out, and Bill Clinton was our front guy.
[02:42:51.892 --> 02:42:57.175]  We'll come back and talk about that, but Fletcher, I want to take calls for you, and also want to talk about what currently is happening.
[02:42:58.857 --> 02:43:04.838]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[02:43:04.838 --> 02:43:07.499]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[02:43:07.499 --> 02:43:09.679]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[02:43:09.679 --> 02:43:12.279]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[02:43:12.279 --> 02:43:15.500]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[02:43:15.500 --> 02:43:17.260]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[02:43:17.260 --> 02:43:23.881]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.

[02:44:58.362 --> 02:45:01.918]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[02:45:06.638 --> 02:45:07.979]  I want you all to know something.
[02:45:07.979 --> 02:45:09.940]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:45:09.940 --> 02:45:13.482]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[02:45:13.482 --> 02:45:16.404]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:45:16.404 --> 02:45:20.847]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up, or rub it down.
[02:45:20.847 --> 02:45:23.048]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:45:23.048 --> 02:45:26.591]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:45:26.591 --> 02:45:30.033]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:45:30.293 --> 02:45:33.174]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:45:33.174 --> 02:45:34.195]  Years ago.
[02:45:34.195 --> 02:45:38.277]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[02:45:38.277 --> 02:45:40.798]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:45:40.798 --> 02:45:43.259]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:45:43.259 --> 02:45:46.381]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:45:46.381 --> 02:45:51.023]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:46:06.915 --> 02:46:15.638]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements, because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[02:46:15.638 --> 02:46:17.818]  So support InfoWars Store.
[02:46:17.818 --> 02:46:22.740]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority, because you don't know, I don't know.
[02:46:22.740 --> 02:46:26.301]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[02:46:26.301 --> 02:46:30.963]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[02:46:30.963 --> 02:46:31.863]  Krill oil.
[02:46:31.863 --> 02:46:34.224]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a
[02:46:35.384 --> 02:46:36.285]  Thank you.
[02:46:59.252 --> 02:47:05.178]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[02:47:28.599 --> 02:47:34.224]  Alright, we're going to open the phones up next hour for Bob Fletcher.
[02:47:54.625 --> 02:47:57.946]  Who has seen it all and was one of the original people predicting everything that's happening.
[02:47:57.946 --> 02:48:11.731]  And Bob, I'm happy we're going over the past and the things that went on, but up front, I wanted to get your view on the current world, the COVID lockdowns, the world government being announced, the UN to be in charge of our medicine and our bodies.
[02:48:11.731 --> 02:48:15.373]  I mean, we're inside the new world order now.
[02:48:15.373 --> 02:48:16.833]  What do you think the people can do?
[02:48:16.833 --> 02:48:21.415]  Can you speak to this as a human being living in this world today, watching all this?
[02:48:23.607 --> 02:48:29.889]  Well, it's it's really is problematic.
[02:48:29.889 --> 02:48:36.930]  Because there's a combination of problems that are really serious.
[02:48:36.930 --> 02:48:50.434]  Even the last couple of days, I was kind of really set aback when not only did was of course, Tucker Carlson was dropped, boom, you know, I mean, he's turning so much money.
[02:48:51.621 --> 02:48:54.702]  For that network, that was a little bewildering.
[02:48:54.702 --> 02:49:11.145]  But then simultaneously, I found out that a couple of what I typically thought were the bad guys, which they are, some of the rest of the network, you know, trying to cover up all of Biden's stuff and everything else for so long.
[02:49:11.145 --> 02:49:15.446]  A handful of the network bigwigs were also fired.
[02:49:15.446 --> 02:49:16.626]  That's spooky to me.
[02:49:17.407 --> 02:49:19.129]  I don't understand that.
[02:49:19.129 --> 02:49:22.633]  That's over my head and there's very little that goes over my head.
[02:49:22.633 --> 02:49:25.636]  I don't understand exactly.
[02:49:26.870 --> 02:49:29.812]  What's going on with that?
[02:49:29.812 --> 02:49:54.044]  In other words, you know, the dismissing of Tucker right in when, of course, he was in the middle of a two-part series with Elon Musk, who also is a real enemy of the bad guys in general, you know, going in and salvaging some of the BS coverage that was taking place and all the rest of that.
[02:49:56.317 --> 02:49:57.678]  But I didn't understand.
[02:49:57.678 --> 02:50:07.006]  It sent me back to see a bunch of people who I commonly had in the bad guys category using simplistic terms.
[02:50:07.006 --> 02:50:18.355]  And when right after that particular extended interview with Elon Musk, who kept again, it was like functioning
[02:50:19.376 --> 02:50:21.117]  About as good guy as we can get.
[02:50:21.117 --> 02:50:38.165]  I mean, besides being very rich, he is worried about humanity, the information, the advancements, things that I'm aware of that most people are not, relative to artificial intelligence.
[02:50:38.165 --> 02:50:45.648]  And that's what Musk was talking about there on Carson Show with Fox News.
[02:50:45.648 --> 02:50:46.689]  He's scared of it.
[02:50:47.705 --> 02:50:55.390]  And I know of events from above top secret whistleblowers that have dealt with me a couple of years ago.
[02:50:55.390 --> 02:51:11.622]  They talked about one of their major experiments with artificial intelligence, for example, that where they had two, two elements with whether whatever their physical thing was, and whether they were strictly computers doesn't make any difference.
[02:51:11.622 --> 02:51:17.186]  You know, the physical, they have physical artificial intelligence now that you would never know
[02:51:18.135 --> 02:51:26.199]  If it was a live person or even a drawing because that's how great they are with that artificial intelligence stuff.
[02:51:26.199 --> 02:51:39.026]  You're going to have people that be able to give you entire presentations on whatever and you're not going to know that they're not even real and they actually are a motion picture pieced together by artificial intelligence.
[02:51:39.026 --> 02:51:43.008]  Some of the stuff that Elon Musk was talking about.
[02:51:45.110 --> 02:51:47.871]  Carson got dropped in the middle of that.
[02:51:47.871 --> 02:51:50.073]  It was a two-part series.
[02:51:50.073 --> 02:51:52.255]  Elon Musk had more he was going to talk about.
[02:51:52.255 --> 02:51:59.119]  The artificial intelligence is devastating.
[02:51:59.119 --> 02:52:00.120]  It's so good.
[02:52:00.120 --> 02:52:04.443]  It is so far ahead of what people can imagine.
[02:52:04.443 --> 02:52:11.628]  And a couple of years ago they had two of them that they had put together and started conversations between each other.
[02:52:11.628 --> 02:52:12.889]  That's two separate
[02:52:13.760 --> 02:52:18.043]  Let's say computers, artificial intelligent computers.
[02:52:18.043 --> 02:52:29.329]  And they ended up, the scientists that were doing the experiments, the electronic wizards that were doing that, they had to shut it down.
[02:52:29.329 --> 02:52:30.270]  Two of them.
[02:52:30.270 --> 02:52:38.395]  They started talking together and they had created their own undecipherable language
[02:52:39.071 --> 02:52:55.183]  And started making plans and communicating at a level that the people that had originally constructed these two artificial intelligent operations, they had to shut it down because they were cut out.
[02:52:55.183 --> 02:53:05.070]  It was a language that they did not understand and they were not, they actually had to just pull the power out of the two of them because they were, had completely cut
[02:53:05.934 --> 02:53:11.278]  Humanity out there, the guys that had created them were cut completely out.
[02:53:11.278 --> 02:53:17.803]  They completed their own, put together their own language and were speaking in a language that was undecipherable by anybody.
[02:53:17.803 --> 02:53:24.929]  And that's the thing, why would the globalists create something that almost every expert agrees will destroy us?
[02:53:24.929 --> 02:53:33.836]  Well, you know, the big deal now is that the Earth, the globe itself,
[02:53:35.635 --> 02:53:44.706]  There are two major problems with the globe and it's the heating up.
[02:53:45.211 --> 02:53:50.254]  Just talking about the heating up and of course they're doing all this green crap which is BS.
[02:53:50.254 --> 02:53:52.136]  Absolutely BS.
[02:53:52.136 --> 02:53:57.159]  Some people are making billions of dollars on, oh we got to reduce this, you know.
[02:53:57.159 --> 02:54:14.791]  They even had, they were talking not only with automobile exhausts and of course factory exhausts and then even they got into cows passing gas and that that was a big problem and we may have to change so that the cows don't pass gas like they do.
[02:54:15.595 --> 02:54:19.696]  That's absolutely BS.
[02:54:19.696 --> 02:54:21.097]  That's crap.
[02:54:21.097 --> 02:54:38.922]  There's nothing on the Earth that is man-made that is causing the problem that we have with the heating up of the solar system, of our solar system, the changes.
[02:54:38.922 --> 02:54:43.523]  I had an above-top-secret person in NASA about a year and a half ago
[02:54:44.699 --> 02:54:47.721]  contacted me and sent me information, etc.
[02:54:47.721 --> 02:55:07.575]  And he said, and this was about 2012, he said the entire solar system is in a different location in space, and in 2012 it started acting up.
[02:55:07.575 --> 02:55:11.437]  And by the way, that's in my film, Endgame, mainline NASA
[02:55:13.467 --> 02:55:20.633]  Reports that the entire solar system's heating up, the ice caps of Mars are melting, you name it.
[02:55:20.633 --> 02:55:22.755]  Yeah, that's absolutely correct.
[02:55:22.755 --> 02:55:31.622]  And it is because, and I have, again it was a top-level NASA guy, oh gosh, it was really very
[02:55:33.721 --> 02:55:37.863]  About, actually, it may have been a couple of years ago, but it started in 2012.
[02:55:37.863 --> 02:55:45.827]  And there is something that people can look up that is just on general Google without going crazy trying to track something down.
[02:55:45.827 --> 02:55:51.189]  So they know this warming is coming and they're going to blame us for it.
[02:55:51.189 --> 02:55:58.492]  Well, yeah, yeah, I got some crazy person calling me.
[02:55:58.492 --> 02:55:59.653]  Anyhow, the
[02:56:00.894 --> 02:56:01.956]  I'm sorry about that.
[02:56:01.956 --> 02:56:03.039]  Hey, we get it.
[02:56:03.039 --> 02:56:03.740]  You're in your house.
[02:56:03.740 --> 02:56:04.161]  It's great.
[02:56:04.161 --> 02:56:04.542]  We love it.
[02:56:04.542 --> 02:56:05.243]  It's real.
[02:56:05.243 --> 02:56:05.824]  Stay there, Bob.
[02:56:05.824 --> 02:56:06.606]  We're going to go to break.
[02:56:06.606 --> 02:56:08.850]  We're going to come back next hour.
[02:56:08.850 --> 02:56:10.995]  I'm going to give the number out right now to take calls.
[02:56:11.789 --> 02:56:13.290]  For Bob Fletcher.
[02:56:13.290 --> 02:56:14.530]  We're taking calls for him.
[02:56:14.530 --> 02:56:16.211]  An icon of the resistance.
[02:56:16.211 --> 02:56:19.012]  A guy that 30 plus years ago was fighting the system.
[02:56:19.012 --> 02:56:19.912]  Has been doing it since.
[02:56:19.912 --> 02:56:23.394]  Your chance to ask him questions or bring up topics next hour.

[02:56:23.614 --> 02:56:24.014]  This one topic.
[02:56:24.014 --> 02:56:24.854]  You can ask him any questions.
[02:56:32.679 --> 02:56:34.002]  Just address it to him.
[02:56:34.002 --> 02:56:34.563]  Bob Fletcher.
[02:56:34.563 --> 02:56:36.126]  Your chance to talk to this living legend.

[02:56:47.258 --> 02:56:48.219]  I want to thank those that did.
[02:56:48.219 --> 02:56:49.339]  I want to encourage those that haven't.
[02:56:49.339 --> 02:56:50.199]  Get one.
[02:56:50.199 --> 02:56:51.040]  Plus, you need this.

[02:57:34.978 --> 02:57:35.479]  Or, 888-253-3139.
[02:57:35.479 --> 02:57:35.720]  888-253-3139.
[02:57:35.720 --> 02:57:39.067]  The number to order products, the number to call us on air, is 877-789-AlexLorevec.
[02:57:48.632 --> 02:57:53.655]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[02:57:53.655 --> 02:57:55.817]  We made it even stronger.
[02:57:55.817 --> 02:57:59.559]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:57:59.559 --> 02:58:06.464]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:58:06.464 --> 02:58:12.888]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:58:12.888 --> 02:58:13.969]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:58:14.625 --> 02:58:27.712]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:58:27.712 --> 02:58:29.693]  It is the super fuel.
[02:58:29.693 --> 02:58:31.174]  RainForce Plus is great.
[02:58:31.174 --> 02:58:32.015]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[02:58:32.015 --> 02:58:32.995]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:58:32.995 --> 02:58:34.176]  They go good with this.
[02:58:34.176 --> 02:58:36.197]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:58:36.917 --> 02:58:38.418]  This is the boss.
[02:58:38.418 --> 02:58:39.138]  TurboForce.
[02:58:39.138 --> 02:58:39.858]  Back in stock.
[02:58:39.858 --> 02:58:40.739]  Discounted.
[02:58:40.739 --> 02:58:42.900]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:42.900 --> 02:58:43.760]  More power.
[02:58:43.760 --> 02:58:44.760]  More strength.
[02:58:44.760 --> 02:58:48.602]  More energy.
[02:58:48.602 --> 02:58:55.265]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[02:58:55.265 --> 02:58:57.206]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[02:58:57.206 --> 02:58:58.707]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[02:58:58.707 --> 02:59:01.508]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[02:59:01.508 --> 02:59:03.509]  And it says, political prisoner.
[02:59:04.309 --> 02:59:06.270]  With an image of President Trump.
[02:59:06.270 --> 02:59:08.712]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[02:59:08.712 --> 02:59:10.853]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[02:59:10.853 --> 02:59:16.236]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[02:59:16.236 --> 02:59:17.437]  Jail background.
[02:59:17.437 --> 02:59:18.477]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[02:59:18.477 --> 02:59:22.620]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[02:59:22.620 --> 02:59:24.221]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[02:59:24.221 --> 02:59:25.241]  No, I'm not running for President.
[02:59:25.241 --> 02:59:27.803]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[02:59:27.803 --> 02:59:28.563]  Red, white, and blue.
[02:59:28.563 --> 02:59:29.444]  Alex Jones for President.
[02:59:30.144 --> 02:59:32.985]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[02:59:32.985 --> 02:59:34.866]  Great way to fund the operation.
[02:59:34.866 --> 02:59:49.770]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:59:49.770 --> 02:59:55.672]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.635 --> 03:00:19.537]  All right, this is a short five-minute segment.
[03:00:19.537 --> 03:00:20.758]  Some stations don't carry it.
[03:00:20.758 --> 03:00:22.941]  Bob Fletcher with us the rest of the hour.
[03:00:22.941 --> 03:00:30.889]  We're into hour number four on this live Wednesday, April 26 transmission, that the enemies of freedom are doing everything they can to shut down.
[03:00:30.889 --> 03:00:36.335]  So the five minutes we have in this segment, Bob, intriguing about global warming, what's happening in the solar system.
[03:00:36.335 --> 03:00:37.095]  That's where I want to go.
[03:00:37.095 --> 03:00:37.996]  You're such a great mind.
[03:00:39.108 --> 03:00:42.091]  is not the stuff you're known for, but all of the research you're doing.
[03:00:42.091 --> 03:00:50.598]  So please continue on what you believe is about to happen on Earth, why the globals are so freaked out, why they're scrambling around trying to kill everybody.
[03:00:50.598 --> 03:00:54.161]  They believe some cataclysm is coming, don't they?
[03:00:54.161 --> 03:01:01.407]  Well, there's the crazy problem about the Earth itself.
[03:01:01.407 --> 03:01:03.709]  The whole solar system, as in 2012, had moved
[03:01:07.251 --> 03:01:16.787]  It's encapsulated in some people, you can go right on Google for this and do some check up on some of what I'm about to say here.
[03:01:16.787 --> 03:01:19.512]  It's the entire solar system
[03:01:21.309 --> 03:01:29.074]  Is encapsulated within a planetary, like a Milky Way, right?
[03:01:29.074 --> 03:01:34.518]  Which is made up of, you know, a multitude of billion-year-old exploded planets, etc, etc.
[03:01:34.518 --> 03:01:36.679]  There's a Milky Way, all right?
[03:01:36.679 --> 03:01:39.181]  It's called the Oort Cloud.
[03:01:39.181 --> 03:01:43.064]  It's O-R-R-T.
[03:01:43.064 --> 03:01:49.268]  And the entire solar system is encapsulated in the middle of this mess,
[03:01:50.109 --> 03:01:51.829]  And again, you can look it up.
[03:01:51.829 --> 03:01:53.810]  So far, you can still look that up.
[03:01:53.810 --> 03:01:57.470]  O-R-R-T, Oort Cloud.
[03:01:57.470 --> 03:02:11.513]  And you will see there, actually, they've had satellites that have gone way out past with telescopes, with the giant Hubble scopes that they sent out several years ago.
[03:02:11.513 --> 03:02:15.374]  It's kind of looking back over its shoulder and shooting what would have been
[03:02:16.646 --> 03:02:21.230]  Photographic documentation related to the solar system itself.
[03:02:21.230 --> 03:02:24.653]  That's a heck of a picture, you know, long ways out, right?
[03:02:24.653 --> 03:02:33.020]  All that billions of years to even see stuff that already happened 10 billion years ago.
[03:02:33.020 --> 03:02:37.324]  We're just getting now in our view with the giant scopes and all of that.
[03:02:37.324 --> 03:02:39.105]  That's pretty amazing stuff.
[03:02:39.105 --> 03:02:40.847]  It's over everybody's head.
[03:02:40.847 --> 03:02:41.267]  But the
[03:02:42.904 --> 03:02:46.973]  Oort Cloud has encapsulated the entire solar system.
[03:02:46.973 --> 03:02:52.306]  In 2012, I had a guy at NASA sent me, he just said,
[03:02:53.614 --> 03:02:59.520]  For what it was worth at that time, he said, you know, just you don't know who sent this, but here it is.
[03:02:59.520 --> 03:03:09.671]  And the entire planetary, the Earth and all of the planets since 2012 have been affected by location.
[03:03:09.671 --> 03:03:10.692]  That's it right there.
[03:03:10.692 --> 03:03:16.438]  And this location in a different point in space.
[03:03:17.449 --> 03:03:42.072]  And what has happened, and that's a perfect picture right there, and by the way that long extended orbit that's shown there is actually Planet X or Nibiru, which periodically, only a few times, has come around and caused, actually originally caused Noah's Flood.
[03:03:43.322 --> 03:03:49.746]  That's how far back, and it's a gigantic circular, it's called Nibiru.
[03:03:49.746 --> 03:03:51.367]  You can look some stuff up on that.
[03:03:51.367 --> 03:03:54.749]  Aren't you talking about the Kuiper Belt too here?
[03:03:54.749 --> 03:03:57.291]  Yeah, excuse me?
[03:03:57.291 --> 03:04:01.794]  The Kuiper Belt, you know, it's not just Pluto out there, there's hundreds of objects.
[03:04:01.794 --> 03:04:11.620]  Yeah, no, what's that long elongated drawing that you had up there, that actually is the Nibiru.
[03:04:12.518 --> 03:04:37.285]  Which is a infrared planet, let me put it this way, it's not a planet, it's actually a comet if you will, but it's on that extraordinary long loop you see, that is the Nibiru, or Planet X they call it, and I did a special report investigation on that also, but that
[03:04:38.877 --> 03:04:40.859]  Is what it comes around.
[03:04:40.859 --> 03:04:45.203]  It is 10 times the size of Earth.
[03:04:45.203 --> 03:04:49.387]  And it has three or four moons that what they refer to as... All right, stay there.
[03:04:49.387 --> 03:04:50.408]  Back in 60 seconds.
[03:04:50.408 --> 03:04:51.549]  Bob Fletcher, incredible.
[03:04:51.549 --> 03:04:52.610]  Phone calls coming up.
[03:04:58.570 --> 03:05:04.216]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth.
[03:05:04.216 --> 03:05:06.899]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[03:05:06.899 --> 03:05:09.521]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[03:05:09.521 --> 03:05:10.262]  Period.
[03:05:10.262 --> 03:05:11.343]  Case closed.
[03:05:11.343 --> 03:05:12.725]  Out to get you and your family.
[03:05:12.725 --> 03:05:17.650]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[03:05:17.650 --> 03:05:19.111]  It's been around about 15 years.
[03:05:19.111 --> 03:05:20.573]  Became the biggest company in the last six.
[03:05:20.993 --> 03:05:30.561]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse-engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[03:05:30.561 --> 03:05:33.764]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[03:05:33.764 --> 03:05:35.285]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[03:05:35.285 --> 03:05:38.088]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[03:05:38.088 --> 03:05:43.312]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price to a leading competitor.
[03:05:43.312 --> 03:05:46.535]  And the media says we're bad, and a cult
[03:05:46.895 --> 03:05:48.776]  We're telling you, you should filter your water.
[03:05:48.776 --> 03:05:50.416]  You should also filter your shower water.
[03:05:50.416 --> 03:05:51.997]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[03:05:51.997 --> 03:05:53.557]  But I'm done talking about that.
[03:05:53.557 --> 03:05:56.198]  The point is, you can get the filters at infowarestore.com.
[03:05:56.198 --> 03:05:57.378]  They're discounted right now.
[03:05:57.378 --> 03:06:02.480]  I'll be back.
[03:06:02.480 --> 03:06:09.162]  We are on the march.
[03:06:09.162 --> 03:06:13.243]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:06:13.243 --> 03:06:14.864]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:16.292 --> 03:06:23.018]  So the establishment is scrambling around trying to hoard resources in underground bases like the world's about to end.
[03:06:23.018 --> 03:06:28.623]  And you got all their talking point people like AOC last Friday said, Tucker Carlson will be removed from here.
[03:06:28.623 --> 03:06:30.144]  He's removed.
[03:06:30.144 --> 03:06:31.265]  Two days later.
[03:06:31.265 --> 03:06:33.908]  She's just a spokesperson.
[03:06:33.908 --> 03:06:36.770]  She said three years ago, the world will end by 2030.
[03:06:36.770 --> 03:06:37.711]  So did Beto O'Rourke.
[03:06:37.711 --> 03:06:39.733]  So did all these other people.
[03:06:39.733 --> 03:06:41.775]  Now they don't mean the world literally ends.
[03:06:41.775 --> 03:06:43.296]  Our world as we know it.
[03:06:44.724 --> 03:06:46.105]  You've all seen the clips.
[03:06:46.105 --> 03:06:48.887]  Crew, grab them, I'm playing again.
[03:06:48.887 --> 03:06:53.769]  But when they say the world ends, they mean something a little different.
[03:06:53.769 --> 03:07:04.316]  And so we're joined by a great patriot, Bob Fletcher, here today, who was exposing this 30-plus years ago, and who we really appreciate coming on.
[03:07:04.316 --> 03:07:09.219]  So we're finishing up with Planet X, Kabiru, why these tabloids are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[03:07:09.219 --> 03:07:11.000]  What do they think or know is coming?
[03:07:14.184 --> 03:07:27.427]  Well, the problem is with the, for example, for starters, the simplistic, unbelievably hard to imagine situation.
[03:07:27.427 --> 03:07:32.908]  The solar system is now located in a different location in space.
[03:07:32.908 --> 03:07:38.029]  The entire solar system itself, by itself, has been reacting since 2012.
[03:07:38.029 --> 03:07:40.130]  And the Earth is heating up,
[03:07:44.420 --> 03:07:52.389]  The Earth in our solar system is the only planet that has a molten interior.
[03:07:52.389 --> 03:07:56.233]  The Earth itself is heating up from the inside out.
[03:07:57.839 --> 03:08:07.202]  That molten interior is reacting to being in our entire solar system in a totally different location in space.
[03:08:07.202 --> 03:08:09.823]  It has affected all of the planets.
[03:08:09.823 --> 03:08:13.324]  All of the other planets are having strange things going on.
[03:08:13.324 --> 03:08:19.646]  Some of them almost look like they're starting to create atmospheres.
[03:08:19.646 --> 03:08:23.027]  They're having just extraordinary reaction to all the planets.
[03:08:23.027 --> 03:08:23.967]  So it's not just the Earth.
[03:08:24.730 --> 03:08:27.612]  But the Earth is being heated up from the inside out.
[03:08:27.612 --> 03:08:35.658]  It's got nothing to do with too many cows passing gas, or exhaust fumes, too many automobiles, and all that green crap.
[03:08:35.658 --> 03:08:48.168]  That's BS, that local, that people on Earth are making billions of dollars with all of this green crap, and it's got nothing to do with, it's not going to affect anything.
[03:08:48.168 --> 03:08:54.012]  All of the ice caps, everything is heating up, they're melting from the inside out,
[03:08:54.844 --> 03:08:57.245]  It's got nothing to do with external.
[03:08:57.245 --> 03:09:14.512]  The tides, actually going back a few years ago now, I used to live in Miami for quite a while, and I have a son down there that runs a gigantic recording studio, one of the biggest in the United States.
[03:09:14.512 --> 03:09:20.514]  Anyhow, the high tides in Miami Beach
[03:09:21.551 --> 03:09:39.626]  A few years ago got to be where all of the regular high tides because of the increased volume of water on the globe from the melting of all of the ice caps both north and south from the inside out
[03:09:40.689 --> 03:09:43.210]  And by the way, it's not salt water.
[03:09:43.210 --> 03:09:52.833]  All those wonderful things, it's all fresh water, which also is screwing up all the solidity in the oceans, etc., etc., and all of that.
[03:09:52.833 --> 03:09:54.493]  It's all being affected.
[03:09:54.493 --> 03:10:03.056]  We have 47 active volcanoes around the globe on a regular basis, including a handful of them that are under the ocean.
[03:10:03.760 --> 03:10:05.080]  They're reacting.
[03:10:05.080 --> 03:10:17.924]  That's why we're having all this poor things like the whales and and and all these huge deaths of and and with different sea creatures etc etc.
[03:10:17.924 --> 03:10:28.207]  It's totally being strange strangely altered by the melting of both the ice caps north and south from the inside out heating up
[03:10:29.469 --> 03:10:32.330]  It's got nothing to do with anything that anybody can stop.
[03:10:32.330 --> 03:10:53.156]  And by the way, what you're saying is wild, because I made a film called Endgame in 2007, and I had Lord Rothschild's son on, the heir to the Rothschild fortune, and I said, why is the Earth supposedly heating up, but then the ice caps on Mars and some moons that have ice are melting, and they have, you know, they have video of this, and he said, well, you know, that's because the Earth's heating up, it's doing it.
[03:10:53.156 --> 03:10:56.937]  No, no, the Earth doesn't heat up and then make things 50 million miles away melt.
[03:10:58.373 --> 03:11:09.876]  But the NASA reports, whether you believe it or not, they're saying that the sun and also the solar system, the radiations change because of where we're at, we go through these cycles, that things are heating up.
[03:11:09.876 --> 03:11:23.039]  So they predicted all this heat up, it hasn't really quite happened yet, but what you're saying is these different waves and different energy sources cause the reactor in the middle of the planet, the planet itself heats up.
[03:11:24.341 --> 03:11:28.804]  That the entire planet is heating up from the inside out.
[03:11:28.804 --> 03:11:31.085]  And, you know, people can believe it or not.
[03:11:31.085 --> 03:11:34.147]  And that's going to mean volcanic eruptions will be seen increase?
[03:11:34.147 --> 03:11:36.808]  That's going to mean?
[03:11:36.808 --> 03:11:39.530]  You realize, well, here's what's happening.
[03:11:39.530 --> 03:11:41.911]  And it's happening right under our noses.
[03:11:41.911 --> 03:11:47.835]  And, you know, and everybody, you know, all the people that theoretically are the, let's say, the expert weather people.
[03:11:49.439 --> 03:11:54.183]  You know, you got the PhDs in how the wind blows, okay.
[03:11:54.183 --> 03:12:00.609]  But what's taking place, excuse me, is that the, it's a combination of things.
[03:12:00.609 --> 03:12:05.313]  The center of the Earth is heating up.
[03:12:05.313 --> 03:12:13.480]  We have, that's what's causing the change in all three layers of our atmosphere.
[03:12:14.329 --> 03:12:19.333]  You go on the Weather State, just go on the Weather Channel and watch it for a little while.
[03:12:19.333 --> 03:12:21.374]  They do not understand.
[03:12:21.374 --> 03:12:23.536]  They do not know what's causing it.
[03:12:23.536 --> 03:12:29.940]  And again, there's still where everybody's pulling this green stuff and you got to do this and got to do that.
[03:12:29.940 --> 03:12:38.606]  All that's going to do is make a few extra people a few billion dollars more by selling all of that green concept.
[03:12:38.606 --> 03:12:39.647]  It's not going to happen.
[03:12:39.647 --> 03:12:40.568]  It's not going to stop.
[03:12:41.440 --> 03:12:50.007]  The Earth is going to be, and I'm saying something that is terrifying, but this is a reality.
[03:12:50.007 --> 03:12:58.854]  The Earth is going to be uninhabitable in a very short period of time for humans.
[03:12:58.854 --> 03:13:03.278]  And that's unfortunately is a scientific reality.
[03:13:03.278 --> 03:13:05.260]  Now, prior to that,
[03:13:06.317 --> 03:13:10.100]  Period of time, which is not too far along, far from now.
[03:13:10.100 --> 03:13:13.022]  As a matter of fact, that's how crazy this is.
[03:13:13.022 --> 03:13:14.863]  And people are going to say I'm nuts or whatever.
[03:13:14.863 --> 03:13:16.465]  That's all fine.
[03:13:16.465 --> 03:13:22.609]  But everything that I have said and done for 30 years has been a reality.
[03:13:22.609 --> 03:13:24.731]  Not enough people knew about it.
[03:13:24.731 --> 03:13:27.573]  I started before we even had computers, for crying out loud.
[03:13:28.231 --> 03:13:30.954]  Long time ago when I got into all of this stuff.
[03:13:30.954 --> 03:13:38.120]  But the bottom line is, the Earth will be uninhabitable by itself.
[03:13:38.120 --> 03:13:44.746]  From the heating up from the inside out, and the oceans will be rising on a regular basis, which they do.
[03:13:48.858 --> 03:14:04.267]  Actually, Genesis says, and now the scientists have proven it, that most of the seas weren't there before it was under the ground, and just a month ago, the Smithsonian said we've confirmed there's underwater oceans bigger than the Pacific, and that's why it described the waters of the deep birth forth, and it made everything flood.
[03:14:04.267 --> 03:14:05.988]  Is that what you're saying?
[03:14:05.988 --> 03:14:10.690]  Well, it's a combination of things.
[03:14:10.690 --> 03:14:13.492]  There are increases in volcanic activity.
[03:14:15.222 --> 03:14:36.993]  The big deal, like I say, if you just go on the Weather Channel and watch what's going on, or even go on Google and places like that that have simplistic information, you'll find out that the drought problem in some areas, the tornadoes in areas.
[03:14:36.993 --> 03:14:39.615]  We had more tornadoes this year.
[03:14:39.615 --> 03:14:44.077]  We have tornadoes every day or two that destroy entire towns.
[03:14:45.977 --> 03:14:50.920]  It's trillions of dollars of stuff just from the tornadoes.
[03:14:50.920 --> 03:15:02.726]  The tornadoes are happening because all three layers of our atmosphere are being screwed with because of the radiation coming out from the Earth itself.
[03:15:02.726 --> 03:15:08.089]  And at the same time the globalists are doing secret weather programs that you talked about 30 years ago that are now public.
[03:15:08.089 --> 03:15:09.450]  We got loaded phone lines.
[03:15:10.353 --> 03:15:13.915]  For Bob Fletcher, loaded phone lines for him.
[03:15:13.915 --> 03:15:14.695]  One card.
[03:15:14.695 --> 03:15:19.618]  Max, Jane, John, Nathaniel, Bart, Greg, Daniel, Greg.
[03:15:19.618 --> 03:15:25.402]  We're going to your phone calls on the other side of this break.
[03:15:25.402 --> 03:15:26.322]  Bob Fletcher's our guest.
[03:15:26.322 --> 03:15:27.643]  He doesn't have a website, doesn't have a P.O.
[03:15:27.643 --> 03:15:29.524]  Box, doesn't have anything.
[03:15:29.524 --> 03:15:33.586]  But he's, we wanted to get his DVDs back out, so we're going to get them, put them on Band Up Video, and create a P.O.
[03:15:33.586 --> 03:15:34.767]  Box to support him.
[03:15:34.767 --> 03:15:36.108]  But what a great guy.
[03:15:36.108 --> 03:15:39.910]  So amazing to have one of the original patriots of the big wave before Alex Jones.
[03:15:40.590 --> 03:15:43.534]  Here, because that's what it's all about, is recognizing those.
[03:15:43.534 --> 03:15:45.757]  And look, long after I'm gone, gather in prison.
[03:15:45.757 --> 03:15:51.644]  I want folks to be remembering the work I did, because it'll energize and enthuse and inspire others.
[03:15:51.644 --> 03:15:52.144]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:57.039 --> 03:16:09.603]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[03:16:09.603 --> 03:16:11.363]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[03:16:11.363 --> 03:16:13.124]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[03:16:13.524 --> 03:16:16.347]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[03:16:16.347 --> 03:16:18.069]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[03:16:18.069 --> 03:16:20.571]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[03:16:20.571 --> 03:16:24.936]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[03:16:24.936 --> 03:16:30.742]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[03:16:30.742 --> 03:16:35.907]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips because
[03:16:36.287 --> 03:16:42.192]  Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is, go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[03:16:42.192 --> 03:16:44.394]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[03:16:44.394 --> 03:16:47.936]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[03:16:47.936 --> 03:16:52.300]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[03:16:58.106 --> 03:17:01.248]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:17:01.248 --> 03:17:03.549]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:17:03.549 --> 03:17:07.472]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:17:07.472 --> 03:17:15.537]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:17:15.537 --> 03:17:24.203]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:17:25.211 --> 03:17:28.872]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:17:28.872 --> 03:17:34.654]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:17:34.654 --> 03:17:37.114]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[03:17:37.114 --> 03:17:37.675]  Keep doing it.
[03:17:37.675 --> 03:17:44.737]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[03:17:44.737 --> 03:17:45.917]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[03:17:46.637 --> 03:17:50.921]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarstore.com.
[03:17:50.921 --> 03:17:55.865]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarstore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:17:55.865 --> 03:17:57.646]  Please take action now.
[03:17:57.646 --> 03:18:09.616]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarstore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[03:18:09.616 --> 03:18:13.960]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in,
[03:18:14.520 --> 03:18:17.961]  Many of you for years have never gone to InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:18:17.961 --> 03:18:26.743]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsTore.com and never experience these great products and never found the operation.
[03:18:26.743 --> 03:18:29.803]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[03:18:29.803 --> 03:18:31.184]  That's great and I thank you.
[03:18:31.184 --> 03:18:32.704]  But we need funds to operate.
[03:18:32.704 --> 03:18:41.546]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil and our PhysiMagnesium and our SleepAid and our Nitric Oxide and our Real Red Pill Plus.
[03:18:41.546 --> 03:18:43.026]  All of these are really great products.
[03:18:43.166 --> 03:18:45.791]  They keep us on air, plus you're missing out on these products.
[03:18:45.791 --> 03:18:54.708]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com
[03:18:56.863 --> 03:19:04.288]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[03:19:04.288 --> 03:19:07.089]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:19:07.089 --> 03:19:15.455]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[03:19:15.455 --> 03:19:17.876]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[03:19:17.876 --> 03:19:20.878]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[03:19:21.178 --> 03:19:23.760]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[03:19:23.760 --> 03:19:32.165]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[03:19:32.165 --> 03:19:34.007]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[03:19:34.007 --> 03:19:40.631]  government began buying this toxic, untreated, industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:19:41.091 --> 03:19:46.274]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:19:46.274 --> 03:19:52.398]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[03:19:52.398 --> 03:19:57.701]  Available now at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:19:57.701 --> 03:20:03.605]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:17.960 --> 03:20:22.986]  So we have the left saying the world's ending in seven years.
[03:20:22.986 --> 03:20:25.869]  People don't say, why are their spokespersons saying that?
[03:20:25.869 --> 03:20:27.691]  AOC said Tucker will be gone.
[03:20:27.691 --> 03:20:28.392]  Friday, he was gone.
[03:20:29.912 --> 03:20:30.553]  It's talking points.
[03:20:30.553 --> 03:20:33.395]  They're getting ready for something big.
[03:20:33.395 --> 03:20:36.657]  I want to take phone calls for Bob Fletcher here today.
[03:20:36.657 --> 03:20:38.318]  Appreciate Bob being with us.
[03:20:38.318 --> 03:20:44.823]  Before I go to Jane and all these other callers, anything else you'd like to add to the viewers, Bob?
[03:20:44.823 --> 03:20:49.247]  No, the truth is, I guess, it's...
[03:20:52.841 --> 03:21:09.805]  It doesn't look good, just in general terms, and I have documentation that we'll get back with yourself and we'll go over some of this other stuff and I'll get back with you guys.
[03:21:09.805 --> 03:21:13.546]  Everything that I'm saying, unfortunately, is out of the horse's mouth.
[03:21:15.505 --> 03:21:22.907]  And a lot of stuff that you get, information would appear that people know what they're talking about, etc.
[03:21:22.907 --> 03:21:27.168]  That's out of the back end of the horse, as opposed to out of the horse's mouth.
[03:21:27.168 --> 03:21:36.090]  Everything I have, and unfortunately have discovered, was delivered to me by these above top secret whistleblowers.
[03:21:36.090 --> 03:21:38.170]  We have weapons that
[03:21:39.076 --> 03:21:43.562]  That are mind-boggling in terms of actual just weapons.
[03:21:43.562 --> 03:21:50.632]  Talk about some of those and we'll go to calls because I remember like 14 years ago the San Francisco Chronicle interviewed and did an Air Force press conference.
[03:21:50.632 --> 03:21:52.074]  They admitted they have antimatter weapons.
[03:21:52.074 --> 03:21:53.056]  They kind of leaked this stuff.
[03:21:54.167 --> 03:21:55.747]  No, absolutely.
[03:21:55.747 --> 03:21:56.607]  We have.
[03:21:56.607 --> 03:21:58.468]  It's called the Particle Beam.
[03:21:58.468 --> 03:21:59.508]  We have it.
[03:21:59.508 --> 03:22:05.989]  Unfortunately, I'm afraid Red China may have it because they've got damn near everything we ever did.
[03:22:05.989 --> 03:22:11.530]  We've been in bed with them even unknowingly for so many years.
[03:22:11.530 --> 03:22:14.991]  If they don't have the Particle Beam, I would be amazed.
[03:22:14.991 --> 03:22:21.652]  I physically have not only everything on the Particle Beam in terms of what it does and how it does it.
[03:22:21.652 --> 03:22:23.332]  It's old Nikola Tesla stuff from
[03:22:24.105 --> 03:22:36.938]  His original idea is in the 1889 and he died in like 1921 when he finally passed away but believe it or not Tesla had laid out everything necessary to do the particle beam.
[03:22:36.938 --> 03:22:41.442]  Particle beam in very brief terms takes atomic
[03:22:44.409 --> 03:23:00.960]  Particles themselves, what we utilize in the atomic bomb with doing a what we call a violent cracking or splitting of atoms, what the particle beam does, it pulls atoms apart.
[03:23:00.960 --> 03:23:04.342]  It doesn't cause an atomic explosion, but it takes
[03:23:05.091 --> 03:23:07.293]  And this is mind-boggling, but we have it.
[03:23:07.293 --> 03:23:21.444]  I even have pictures of the generator live from Area 51 that generates, and this is not a typo, 500 million volts.
[03:23:21.444 --> 03:23:30.651]  And the delivery system is like a weapon, a laser weapon that is in orbit.
[03:23:31.445 --> 03:23:38.508]  With several of our own spacecraft in orbit on a regular basis has the delivery system.
[03:23:38.508 --> 03:23:56.097]  So this 500 million volt generator, which I have actual pictures of it from Area 51, I mean live films inside the building, that generates the power which is transmitted to a receiving weapon, a delivery system, which is a laser weapon, so to speak,
[03:23:57.646 --> 03:24:16.513]  And although it's different from a common laser, because it actually causes the twin towers, 1,450 feet tall, 550,000 tons each, to turn to dust before it hits the ground in nine seconds.
[03:24:16.513 --> 03:24:22.715]  Well, to break that down, I mean a particle beam takes cyclotronic particles, accelerated, and then puts them into a laser beam.
[03:24:23.960 --> 03:24:27.182]  Well, it's technically not considered to be a laser.
[03:24:27.182 --> 03:24:30.183]  It is a beam, so to speak.
[03:24:30.183 --> 03:24:35.386]  But what it does is it separates individual atoms.
[03:24:35.386 --> 03:24:38.028]  It pulls atoms apart.
[03:24:38.028 --> 03:24:49.234]  If you had a nuclear weapon that was about to be exploded or you were concerned about it, if you struck it one second with this particle beam,
[03:24:50.563 --> 03:24:53.566]  It would turn to dust and would just blow away into the wind.
[03:24:53.566 --> 03:25:02.498]  And for people that tried to figure it out and make a lot of stories about it, that is exactly what brought down the Twin Towers.
[03:25:02.498 --> 03:25:04.260]  They both came down 550,000 tons each.
[03:25:08.470 --> 03:25:17.095]  Hardened mass, steel, stainless steel, and all the rest of it, and they were turned to dust before they hit the ground.
[03:25:17.095 --> 03:25:36.064]  And then the media makes jokes about space lasers, but Max Planck and the entire atomic bomb... The particle beam, if you hit an atomic bomb with it, it would turn to dust before it ignited.
[03:25:36.064 --> 03:25:37.005]  If you hit the unit,
[03:25:37.631 --> 03:25:42.794]  With a particle beam, it would just blow away, would just look like a dust cloud and that's all it is.
[03:25:42.794 --> 03:25:50.218]  It separates individual atoms, atomic structures, individual atoms of solid mass.
[03:25:50.218 --> 03:25:54.120]  We saw it with the Twin Towers, people never knew it.
[03:25:54.120 --> 03:25:57.021]  I even have a picture, I have all the information.
[03:25:57.021 --> 03:26:01.223]  Feel free to use any means necessary, but I want them alive.
[03:26:01.223 --> 03:26:02.424]  No disintegrations.
[03:26:03.915 --> 03:26:06.496]  That's crazy, but... You know what I'm saying?
[03:26:06.496 --> 03:26:10.978]  It's literally a disintegration beam.
[03:26:10.978 --> 03:26:13.379]  What I'm telling you is a reality.
[03:26:13.379 --> 03:26:18.441]  We have it, and I believe Red China probably has it, too.
[03:26:18.441 --> 03:26:25.923]  The problem is, you know, we're headed towards nuclear war.
[03:26:25.923 --> 03:26:26.444]  Let's do this.
[03:26:26.444 --> 03:26:27.664]  I'm going to give all these callers time.
[03:26:27.664 --> 03:26:32.086]  We can take all these calls in two segments, but spend the last three minutes to brag on Ukraine.
[03:26:32.086 --> 03:26:32.766]  What's your view on that?
[03:26:34.295 --> 03:26:39.419]  Oh, you know, we don't even know if they're getting the weapons.
[03:26:39.419 --> 03:26:41.620]  There's been so much money sent over there.
[03:26:41.620 --> 03:26:53.268]  And the truth is, I don't know, I feel bad for it because it's just another, because Putin's a wacko.
[03:26:53.268 --> 03:26:56.350]  But then we match him one on one with with Biden.
[03:26:57.065 --> 03:27:04.846]  You know, he's loose change and Putin's completely into a, I don't give a damn, I might take out
[03:27:05.598 --> 03:27:13.981]  I may launch nuclear into any place I want to, because he's sick, he's got other problems that nobody knows about.
[03:27:13.981 --> 03:27:15.942]  He's isolated himself.
[03:27:15.942 --> 03:27:31.227]  He sits, when he has meetings with his own people, back in the high-level persons that he meets in the Soviet Union, in Moscow, there's no more Union anyhow, but in Moscow,
[03:27:31.977 --> 03:27:37.339]  He sits 55 feet away from people that he's talking to, his own commanders.
[03:27:37.339 --> 03:27:38.960]  He's got problems.
[03:27:38.960 --> 03:27:41.361]  Physical, mental, psychological, emotional.
[03:27:41.361 --> 03:27:42.642]  He's a wreck.
[03:27:42.642 --> 03:27:45.343]  You know, and we got him over there.
[03:27:45.343 --> 03:27:49.845]  Let me tell everybody something that's actual figures.
[03:27:49.845 --> 03:27:59.409]  There are today, in the globe, around the globe, 17,000 nuclear weapons.
[03:27:59.409 --> 03:28:01.370]  That's a number, a real number.
[03:28:02.293 --> 03:28:22.039]  And only three or four of them, if they're shot off, any place, Israel, you know, in the Mideast, the Far East, any place, or if Russia does a couple of them someplace, first off, most all of them are a hundred times bigger than Hiroshima's in their volume.
[03:28:24.091 --> 03:28:34.254]  And there are 17,000 and any five or six will set up a cloud that will turn the globe into a nuclear winter.
[03:28:34.254 --> 03:28:36.435]  We won't have sun for a hundred years.
[03:28:36.435 --> 03:28:46.858]  That's been there, done that already with going back millions of years back with a huge meteor or comet or whatever it was that hit and caused that.
[03:28:46.858 --> 03:28:47.898]  All right, incredible.
[03:28:47.898 --> 03:28:49.198]  Bob Fletcher is our guest.
[03:28:49.198 --> 03:28:50.099]  Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:50.099 --> 03:28:50.819]  Call straight ahead.
[03:28:50.819 --> 03:28:51.239]  Stay with us.
[03:28:56.960 --> 03:29:03.626]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:29:03.626 --> 03:29:05.548]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:29:05.548 --> 03:29:07.069]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[03:29:07.069 --> 03:29:09.411]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[03:29:09.411 --> 03:29:11.873]  And it says political prisoner.
[03:29:12.654 --> 03:29:14.616]  With an image of President Trump.
[03:29:14.616 --> 03:29:17.058]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:29:17.058 --> 03:29:19.199]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:29:19.199 --> 03:29:25.785]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[03:29:25.785 --> 03:29:26.846]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:29:26.846 --> 03:29:30.969]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:29:30.969 --> 03:29:32.571]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[03:29:32.571 --> 03:29:33.591]  No, I'm not running for President.
[03:29:33.591 --> 03:29:36.153]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[03:29:36.153 --> 03:29:36.934]  Red, white, and blue.
[03:29:36.934 --> 03:29:37.795]  Alex Jones for President.
[03:29:38.495 --> 03:29:41.338]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[03:29:41.338 --> 03:29:43.220]  Great way to fund the operation.
[03:29:43.220 --> 03:29:52.488]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:29:56.618 --> 03:30:02.327]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth.
[03:30:02.327 --> 03:30:05.011]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[03:30:05.011 --> 03:30:07.635]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[03:30:07.635 --> 03:30:08.376]  Period.
[03:30:08.376 --> 03:30:09.478]  Case closed.
[03:30:09.478 --> 03:30:10.840]  Out to get you and your family.
[03:30:10.840 --> 03:30:11.320]  We sell.
[03:30:11.821 --> 03:30:19.111]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group, that's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[03:30:19.111 --> 03:30:26.682]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good
[03:30:27.483 --> 03:30:31.865]  In all the studies, it reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[03:30:31.865 --> 03:30:33.386]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[03:30:33.386 --> 03:30:36.207]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[03:30:36.207 --> 03:30:41.430]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[03:30:41.430 --> 03:30:46.892]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:30:46.892 --> 03:30:48.553]  You should also filter your shower water.
[03:30:48.553 --> 03:30:49.974]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[03:30:49.974 --> 03:30:51.675]  But I'm done talking about that.
[03:30:51.675 --> 03:30:54.236]  The point is, you can get the filters at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:30:54.236 --> 03:30:55.437]  They're discounted right now.
[03:30:55.437 --> 03:30:56.157]  Finally back in stock.
[03:30:56.417 --> 03:30:59.949]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[03:31:04.690 --> 03:31:06.031]  I want you all to know something.
[03:31:06.031 --> 03:31:07.993]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:31:07.993 --> 03:31:11.536]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[03:31:11.536 --> 03:31:14.659]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:31:14.659 --> 03:31:18.883]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[03:31:18.883 --> 03:31:21.125]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:31:21.125 --> 03:31:24.648]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:31:24.648 --> 03:31:28.091]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[03:31:28.351 --> 03:31:31.232]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[03:31:31.232 --> 03:31:32.252]  Years ago.
[03:31:32.252 --> 03:31:34.333]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[03:31:34.333 --> 03:31:36.334]  Not for a second.
[03:31:36.334 --> 03:31:38.835]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:31:38.835 --> 03:31:41.315]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:31:41.315 --> 03:31:44.436]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[03:31:44.436 --> 03:31:49.078]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:31:56.812 --> 03:32:02.815]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the Globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[03:32:02.815 --> 03:32:05.476]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[03:32:05.476 --> 03:32:07.657]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[03:32:07.657 --> 03:32:10.238]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[03:32:10.238 --> 03:32:13.460]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[03:32:13.460 --> 03:32:15.240]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[03:32:15.240 --> 03:32:21.863]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[03:32:21.863 --> 03:32:24.645]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[03:32:25.612 --> 03:32:27.713]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[03:32:27.713 --> 03:32:32.357]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[03:32:32.357 --> 03:32:36.079]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[03:32:36.079 --> 03:32:39.221]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[03:32:39.221 --> 03:32:41.763]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[03:32:41.763 --> 03:32:43.124]  We're barely hanging on.
[03:32:43.124 --> 03:32:46.086]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support.
[03:32:46.086 --> 03:32:48.908]  We'll get a great product at the same time at InfoWars.com.
[03:32:48.908 --> 03:32:50.268]  So don't procrastinate.
[03:32:50.268 --> 03:32:51.589]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[03:32:51.589 --> 03:32:55.572]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[03:32:58.494 --> 03:33:10.685]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:10.685 --> 03:33:13.587]  Al Gore.
[03:33:13.587 --> 03:33:15.909]  John Kerry.
[03:33:15.909 --> 03:33:19.032]  CNN.
[03:33:19.032 --> 03:33:21.133]  AOC.
[03:33:21.133 --> 03:33:21.774]  Back to Aurore.
[03:33:23.886 --> 03:33:25.807]  The world ends in 2030.
[03:33:25.807 --> 03:33:32.210]  Why are they saying it?
[03:33:32.210 --> 03:33:46.396]  Millennials and people and you know Gen Z and all these folks that come after us are looking up and we're like the world is gonna end in 12 years if we don't address climate change and your biggest issue is
[03:33:49.211 --> 03:33:52.653]  Your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it?
[03:33:52.653 --> 03:34:01.679]  To make sure that we make this transition in the ten years that we have left to us as the science and scientists tell us.
[03:34:01.679 --> 03:34:04.501]  So that's them three years ago saying we're all dead.
[03:34:04.501 --> 03:34:07.083]  Bob Fletcher, let's go to the phone calls.
[03:34:07.083 --> 03:34:08.845]  Appreciate callers holding.
[03:34:08.845 --> 03:34:10.566]  Max in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[03:34:10.566 --> 03:34:11.987]  You have a question for Bob Fletcher.
[03:34:13.772 --> 03:34:16.594]  Hi, Mr. Fletcher, and hi, Mr. Jones.
[03:34:16.594 --> 03:34:24.280]  I wanted to ask Mr. Fletcher, in his experience, what's some of the wildest technologies he thinks are real?
[03:34:24.280 --> 03:34:34.368]  He mentioned the Death Ray and Nibiru, but what's the most down-the-rabbit-hole technologies you think are a reality, in his opinion?
[03:34:37.081 --> 03:34:55.475]  Well, basically, probably the most amazing is the particle beam, which we have, and we've utilized it actually, unfortunately, on the Twin Towers.
[03:34:55.475 --> 03:35:02.660]  By the way, I have footage that shows the actual dustification
[03:35:03.494 --> 03:35:05.295]  Of the Twin Towers.
[03:35:05.295 --> 03:35:19.900]  These two towers, 1500 feet high, 200 feet square, hardened cement, rebar, stainless steel, and what have you, constructed by the way so that a plane could not go into it.
[03:35:19.900 --> 03:35:26.023]  Those two planes that went into on 9-11, went into the side of the Twin Towers.
[03:35:26.023 --> 03:35:29.564]  They were constructed, synthetic,
[03:35:31.359 --> 03:35:32.961]  Penetration weapons.
[03:35:32.961 --> 03:35:39.188]  They were made by with depleted uranium, which is seven times denser than steel.
[03:35:39.188 --> 03:35:42.932]  They were not the airlines that had been hijacked.
[03:35:42.932 --> 03:35:43.994]  They had been replaced.
[03:35:44.614 --> 03:35:59.506]  With in the air, and I have all of that on one of my exposés, showed everything how it's done and even the live footage where you can see 17 stories or more.
[03:35:59.506 --> 03:36:01.928]  Actually, I show all of the building.
[03:36:01.928 --> 03:36:06.992]  When it came down, the Twin Towers are turned to dust before they hit the ground.
[03:36:06.992 --> 03:36:09.174]  We ended up with one and a half floors.
[03:36:10.581 --> 03:36:12.964]  Of what was 550,000 tons.
[03:36:12.964 --> 03:36:16.308]  And dust all over the city, but let's expand on that.
[03:36:16.308 --> 03:36:18.070]  In Operation Northwoods, declassified in 2000.
[03:36:20.165 --> 03:36:21.306]  The CIA under L.L.
[03:36:21.306 --> 03:36:38.079]  Lemonsir, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Curtis LeMay, Joint Chiefs of Staff, admitted to planning to have CIA get on planes with one tail number, have it take off, and have another drone plane they would use to then crash and blame on the Communists or on the Cubans.
[03:36:38.079 --> 03:36:42.103]  So that whole plan about switching planes out is historic.
[03:36:42.103 --> 03:36:43.704]  Yeah.
[03:36:43.704 --> 03:36:44.825]  And that's a reality.
[03:36:44.825 --> 03:36:48.628]  And I did one entire report on it where I show that whole thing.
[03:36:49.332 --> 03:36:58.765]  And explain the depleted uranium, which by the way, depleted uranium is what we use on our tank penetration missiles.
[03:36:59.502 --> 03:37:19.109]  There are not even necessary to have explosives, but they have they if you just using kinetic energy of something that will actually go through the side of four or six inches of steel tanks go right through the side of it and not even slow down as a matter of fact and come out the backside.
[03:37:21.212 --> 03:37:26.795]  Those are made with depleted uranium, seven times the density of steel.
[03:37:26.795 --> 03:37:28.757]  And that's what we utilize.
[03:37:28.757 --> 03:37:37.462]  We have also a thing called rail guns, which are just no explosives in them, no explosives to launch them.
[03:37:37.462 --> 03:37:45.507]  They use magnetics, negative and positive electronics to launch rails, what they're called rails.
[03:37:45.507 --> 03:37:46.868]  We have a rail gun ship.
[03:37:48.139 --> 03:37:56.965]  That, as a matter of fact, the testing for the railgun ship was done 1,000 feet from my house in Bayview, Idaho.
[03:37:56.965 --> 03:37:59.246]  Sure, that's all on record.
[03:37:59.246 --> 03:38:00.727]  All right, Max, great question.
[03:38:00.727 --> 03:38:02.068]  Let's talk to Jane in Michigan.
[03:38:02.068 --> 03:38:02.788]  Jane, you're on the air.
[03:38:02.788 --> 03:38:04.910]  Go ahead.
[03:38:04.910 --> 03:38:05.670]  Oh, hello.
[03:38:05.670 --> 03:38:07.191]  Can you guys hear me?
[03:38:07.191 --> 03:38:08.572]  I sure can.
[03:38:08.572 --> 03:38:09.112]  Oh, thank you.
[03:38:09.112 --> 03:38:11.314]  As soon as you came on, my phone started.
[03:38:11.314 --> 03:38:11.954]  It's okay.
[03:38:11.954 --> 03:38:12.374]  Go ahead.
[03:38:12.374 --> 03:38:13.115]  We're glad you called.
[03:38:13.115 --> 03:38:13.375]  Go ahead.
[03:38:14.266 --> 03:38:15.427]  Okay, wonderful.
[03:38:15.427 --> 03:38:23.313]  So, I just wanted, I have a quick question first about what you guys were just talking about with the weapons that we're currently using.
[03:38:23.313 --> 03:38:37.083]  And I'm curious if, you know, like, testing these weapons and using them could be the cause of all the problems that we're having with our planet and throughout the solar system.
[03:38:37.083 --> 03:38:39.225]  Yeah, what does nuclear testing do to the atmosphere?
[03:38:39.225 --> 03:38:39.905]  That's a good question.
[03:38:45.710 --> 03:39:00.204]  The nuclear testing actually see the point unfortunately at this point in time other than the fact that we have 17,000 nuclear weapons that are about a hundred times the Hiroshima
[03:39:01.010 --> 03:39:05.033]  You know, I mean, that's that's where we really lost it.
[03:39:05.033 --> 03:39:06.695]  We lost control of that.
[03:39:06.695 --> 03:39:11.939]  I mean, you know, the good guys have it, bad guys have it, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:39:11.939 --> 03:39:15.322]  The testing is not a problem.
[03:39:15.322 --> 03:39:19.185]  The reality is how many of them have finished.
[03:39:20.086 --> 03:39:33.589]  Actual products are out there and again, unfortunately, the number is 17,000 atomic weapons, approximately 100 times that of the one that took out Japan, Hiroshima.
[03:39:34.808 --> 03:39:38.931]  And they're all over the damn place and it's out of control.
[03:39:38.931 --> 03:39:56.043]  We have, see a lot of our, the people who are our best friends around the globe, we've supplied them with 3, 4, 5, 8, 12, 16, you know, each or a couple thousand depending on what and who they are.
[03:39:56.043 --> 03:39:57.984]  I think we have something like 4,000 of these things.
[03:39:57.984 --> 03:39:58.264]  Russia
[03:40:00.726 --> 03:40:04.208]  Theoretically, and has 4,000 of them.
[03:40:04.208 --> 03:40:06.448]  Sure, but I know there's a lot of secret weapons.
[03:40:06.448 --> 03:40:11.991]  To her question, all these secret technologies getting tested, could that be hurting the environment?
[03:40:11.991 --> 03:40:14.292]  And I appreciate your call, Jane.
[03:40:14.292 --> 03:40:15.232]  Yeah.
[03:40:15.232 --> 03:40:21.154]  No, the problem, the environment is what I mentioned earlier, maybe she missed it.
[03:40:21.154 --> 03:40:22.295]  The earth is heating up.
[03:40:22.981 --> 03:40:29.491]  And that's affecting all the winds, all everything's affecting droughts, it's affecting floods.
[03:40:29.491 --> 03:40:35.821]  We have, right now... But to be clear, it's not carbon dioxide doing it, you're saying it's the earth itself, and the magnetic field's moving too.
[03:40:37.060 --> 03:40:50.684]  Yeah, the problem is that all of the layers of the Earth, the atmospheric layers themselves, and that's what's causing, and not counting the fact that it also causes increase in volcanic activity.
[03:40:50.684 --> 03:41:00.067]  Sure, but for folks who don't know, I've seen PBS documentaries, they have like two mile deep mines in South Africa, it's like 150 degrees, I've got to pump air conditioning into it.
[03:41:00.067 --> 03:41:05.269]  People don't know that just a few miles down, the Earth gets hotter and hotter and hotter, and you're saying that heat is coming out.
[03:41:06.454 --> 03:41:15.840]  Yes, that's the problem that's causing all of the changes, and if you go around the globe... Well, let's jam in one more call.
[03:41:15.840 --> 03:41:16.961]  We've got to get these callers.
[03:41:16.961 --> 03:41:21.224]  OneCardMoney from Hawaii, you're on the air with Bob Fletcher.
[03:41:21.224 --> 03:41:26.207]  Yes, a slight change of topic here.
[03:41:26.207 --> 03:41:34.032]  His mention of a particle beam weapon and the World Trade Center collapse, I would only point out
[03:41:34.591 --> 03:41:52.342]  Soviet nuclear compliance officer Dmitry has described under the SALT II treaty a carve-out for 140 kiloton and below yield of a nuclear device.
[03:41:52.342 --> 03:41:59.086]  And that causes what he describes, what Mr. Fletcher describes, as dustification.
[03:41:59.086 --> 03:42:02.127]  Which, you saw the towers collapse.
[03:42:02.127 --> 03:42:03.168]  It is transmitted
[03:42:03.647 --> 03:42:08.449]  Along the most dense materials, which would have been the steel girders.
[03:42:08.449 --> 03:42:16.451]  Mr. Fletcher's premise of an airplane made of depleted uranium does not hold water.
[03:42:16.451 --> 03:42:20.112]  Depleted uranium is heavier than lead.
[03:42:20.112 --> 03:42:24.994]  The idea of a 767 that is constructed from lead doesn't fly.
[03:42:24.994 --> 03:42:28.255]  I have to take exception with him.
[03:42:28.255 --> 03:42:32.116]  In terms of climate change, some scientists
[03:42:32.552 --> 03:42:42.630]  Leading scientists, geophysicists have posited that the Earth's core seems to be altering its spin.
[03:42:46.554 --> 03:43:06.978]  No doubt the magnetic field's already moved and I skipped the break we get more time so don't hang up one card but I don't think what Bob says the whole plane's about a DU he's saying it's some of the body was made up to have a greater penetration what would the what Intel do you have on that Bob and why would they if they're gonna use a particle beam why would they have a airplane jacketed in a DU?
[03:43:06.978 --> 03:43:11.639]  The two aircraft by the way they were supposed to be three
[03:43:12.925 --> 03:43:14.486]  Uh, and it wasn't a third one.
[03:43:14.486 --> 03:43:16.688]  The third one was supposed to hit Building 7.
[03:43:16.688 --> 03:43:20.491]  Uh, and they're made, manufactured...
[03:43:21.659 --> 03:43:37.805]  First off, I actually worked for Boeing and built 747s back when I was a machinist and programmer on the numerical control equipment at Boeing and at Lockheed at a short period of time in my life.
[03:43:37.805 --> 03:43:42.047]  All right, I built the 747s for crying out loud.
[03:43:42.047 --> 03:43:44.928]  And the idea that any aluminum aircraft
[03:43:46.474 --> 03:43:52.016]  Could fly through those buildings, which is what they showed us.
[03:43:52.016 --> 03:43:54.416]  That's not happening.
[03:43:54.416 --> 03:43:59.978]  It was done with, and the term is depleted uranium.
[03:43:59.978 --> 03:44:07.820]  Depleted uranium is what they utilize on the tank penetration missiles.
[03:44:07.820 --> 03:44:10.361]  You're not saying the whole airplane's that.
[03:44:10.361 --> 03:44:13.101]  You're saying what you saw looked like DU.
[03:44:13.101 --> 03:44:15.262]  Let's bring one card Monty back in.
[03:44:15.262 --> 03:44:15.502]  Go ahead.
[03:44:17.812 --> 03:44:24.598]  The FBI, who was on the scene, confiscated most of the photos.
[03:44:24.598 --> 03:44:38.469]  If you search Dimitri Kalizov, K-H-A-L-E-Z-O-V, he has pictures on his site that show the very wing tips penetrating steel.
[03:44:38.469 --> 03:44:41.171]  Now, as far as Mr. Fletcher is concerned,
[03:44:41.753 --> 03:44:52.164]  I have no problem of saying that multiple sources could have been used, but how would Mr. Fletcher account for the presence of thermitic material in the residence?
[03:44:52.164 --> 03:44:56.429]  Well, that's right, because they have thermite jacketing that's been confirmed on the towers.
[03:44:56.429 --> 03:44:59.972]  They had a special upgrade above the buildings the months before.
[03:44:59.972 --> 03:45:01.234]  Great points, great questions.
[03:45:01.234 --> 03:45:01.754]  One card, Monty.
[03:45:01.754 --> 03:45:02.195]  Mr. Fletcher.
[03:45:05.055 --> 03:45:12.757]  Well, the bottom line is I have all of the documentation.
[03:45:12.757 --> 03:45:24.620]  I have the films that were supplied to me from a multitude of places, some of them even overseas.
[03:45:24.620 --> 03:45:33.502]  I have the films that shows the building and parts of the remaining building turned to dust and blow away.
[03:45:34.110 --> 03:45:36.452]  That is called the particle beam.
[03:45:36.452 --> 03:45:49.782]  And there was a woman, I don't have it handy, that had written an entire book, she's a scientist, and she wrote a book that was called, Where Did the Towers Go?
[03:45:49.782 --> 03:46:01.270]  She's a scientist, and she said, without knowing, when she published her book, she did not know what I knew, and that was that we had the particle beam, which
[03:46:02.443 --> 03:46:03.203]  Does what it does.
[03:46:03.203 --> 03:46:04.304]  It separates atoms.
[03:46:04.304 --> 03:46:06.785]  Turns solid mass to dust.
[03:46:06.785 --> 03:46:08.645]  And that's what was utilized.
[03:46:08.645 --> 03:46:10.046]  There may have been other things in there.
[03:46:10.046 --> 03:46:11.707]  Well, listen, I know this.
[03:46:11.707 --> 03:46:14.288]  Building 7 was the CIA headquarters.
[03:46:14.288 --> 03:46:16.008]  They announced on the news they were going to blow it up.
[03:46:16.008 --> 03:46:17.409]  We have all the newscasts saying it.
[03:46:17.409 --> 03:46:21.671]  They blew it up and later said they didn't blow it up.
[03:46:21.671 --> 03:46:25.712]  Well, you're talking about when you say blow it up, you're talking about the towers?
[03:46:25.712 --> 03:46:26.292]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:46:26.292 --> 03:46:26.853]  Building 7.
[03:46:26.853 --> 03:46:27.653]  They said, we're going to pull it.
[03:46:27.653 --> 03:46:28.533]  We're going to bring it down.
[03:46:28.533 --> 03:46:30.534]  And they had a countdown on the news and blew it up.
[03:46:32.409 --> 03:46:35.412]  Here's the problem.
[03:46:35.412 --> 03:46:40.898]  There were three craft that were designed to hit three buildings.
[03:46:40.898 --> 03:46:46.103]  And they were manufactured with depleted uranium, which is denser than steel.
[03:46:46.103 --> 03:46:52.630]  And when you make the outside of that thing and the cowling, I actually have films
[03:46:53.453 --> 03:47:05.817]  that shows the front cowling 17 feet of the front nose cone of the craft that flew into the side of the building coming out the back side.
[03:47:05.817 --> 03:47:16.040]  I actually have the films of that and I got news and then in about two seconds after it it passed through the out the back side 220 feet
[03:47:19.187 --> 03:47:25.511]  Came out the backside, punched through the backside, and I have film that shows there's not a scratch on it.
[03:47:25.511 --> 03:47:27.452]  All right, let's take more calls.
[03:47:27.452 --> 03:47:30.954]  John in Nebraska, you're on the air with Bob Fletcher.
[03:47:30.954 --> 03:47:37.658]  Oh yeah, Bob, I first heard you on Dr. Stan Monteith, I think, Radio Liberty in the 90s?
[03:47:37.658 --> 03:47:40.960]  Yes, God bless him, he passed away.
[03:47:40.960 --> 03:47:47.364]  Yeah, and the last I'd heard of you, Bob, was on your Planet X, and you kind of focused on that plate.
[03:47:48.184 --> 03:47:48.284]  Well,
[03:48:14.503 --> 03:48:24.649]  To answer part of that question anyhow, so to speak, the Bush families are Satanist, period.
[03:48:24.649 --> 03:48:33.495]  And I don't know anything about the sex life of Barbara Bush or any of that kind of stuff or where that may have come from, but that's the least of our concerns.
[03:48:33.495 --> 03:48:42.181]  The bottom line is, according to the original person that got me convinced with that was Ted Gunderson.
[03:48:43.102 --> 03:48:50.524]  Ted Gunderson was the head of the Los Angeles FBI for about 13 years.
[03:48:50.524 --> 03:48:56.085]  He was 14, 15 years as an agent prior to being the head of it.
[03:48:56.085 --> 03:49:11.948]  When he retired, Ted Gunderson went full-time with Bob Fletcher, distributing my DVDs and expanding on handling and distributing all of my DVDs that I had done at that time.
[03:49:12.906 --> 03:49:14.187]  And that's what he did.
[03:49:14.187 --> 03:49:20.429]  Amazingly, you know, God bless him, he died of natural causes.
[03:49:20.429 --> 03:49:31.412]  And there's a heck of a lot of, there are entire shiploads of people that have been taken out by the bad guys, not by natural forces, that's for sure.
[03:49:31.412 --> 03:49:33.473]  All right, John, anything else?
[03:49:33.473 --> 03:49:39.055]  Judy Wood, fellas, was the doctor of justification.
[03:49:39.055 --> 03:49:40.175]  All right, thank you.
[03:49:40.175 --> 03:49:41.856]  Nathaniel in Alabama, you're on the air.
[03:49:47.122 --> 03:49:49.324]  Nathaniel, you there?
[03:49:49.324 --> 03:49:49.804]  Yes, sir.
[03:49:49.804 --> 03:49:50.585]  Sorry about that.
[03:49:50.585 --> 03:49:52.486]  Alright, your question is, are we past the point of no return?
[03:49:52.486 --> 03:49:55.949]  Go ahead and talk right to your telephone.
[03:49:55.949 --> 03:49:56.610]  Yes, sir.
[03:49:56.610 --> 03:49:59.012]  So, Mr. Fletcher, I'm 23, talking to my grandparents.
[03:49:59.012 --> 03:50:00.853]  Your phone's really bad.
[03:50:00.853 --> 03:50:04.777]  Can you take it off speaker?
[03:50:04.777 --> 03:50:06.558]  Yes, is that better?
[03:50:06.558 --> 03:50:07.038]  Not much.
[03:50:07.038 --> 03:50:09.640]  Just try to talk right to your phone, okay?
[03:50:09.640 --> 03:50:10.962]  Yes.
[03:50:10.962 --> 03:50:14.785]  So, yeah, do you think we're past the point of no return?
[03:50:14.785 --> 03:50:14.985]  I mean,
[03:50:15.600 --> 03:50:20.782]  Living for 80 plus years, you see how the world has changed so much.
[03:50:20.782 --> 03:50:23.384]  And I'm sure it's scary.
[03:50:23.384 --> 03:50:26.505]  I just unfortunately don't have that.
[03:50:26.505 --> 03:50:30.046]  Don't have that experience.
[03:50:30.046 --> 03:50:30.627]  Then younger.
[03:50:30.627 --> 03:50:36.229]  So what do you think?
[03:50:36.229 --> 03:50:40.191]  OK, I'm sorry, I didn't hear that very well.
[03:50:40.191 --> 03:50:43.633]  He said, are we past the point of no return?
[03:50:43.633 --> 03:50:44.013]  Oh, yeah.
[03:50:45.661 --> 03:50:51.164]  Yes, unfortunately, I would have to say we certainly are.
[03:50:51.164 --> 03:50:53.246]  We have multiple problems.
[03:50:53.246 --> 03:51:03.671]  We have a couple of screwballs in running America for, you know, at this point in time, more than we have a real problem with.
[03:51:03.671 --> 03:51:04.572]  Who is the ruling?
[03:51:04.572 --> 03:51:06.052]  Everybody says, oh, it's this group or that group.
[03:51:06.052 --> 03:51:11.075]  It's a bunch of corrupt people that have the same eugenics, mad scientist view in my world view.
[03:51:11.075 --> 03:51:11.776]  They're globalists.
[03:51:11.776 --> 03:51:14.057]  But who would you describe as the dominant force?
[03:51:17.867 --> 03:51:18.908]  It's hard to say.
[03:51:18.908 --> 03:51:30.476]  They zeroed in on work very criminally to get Biden in there, for starters.
[03:51:30.476 --> 03:51:33.879]  Biden himself has sold us out.
[03:51:34.485 --> 03:51:36.787]  To the Red Chinese, period.
[03:51:36.787 --> 03:51:38.189]  That's obvious.
[03:51:38.189 --> 03:51:49.699]  And some of this is going to surface, finally, you know, with all the business, with multi-millions of dollars to everybody that had the name Biden.
[03:51:49.699 --> 03:51:52.382]  Got a truckload of cash.
[03:51:52.382 --> 03:51:58.648]  And that will probably come out with the new congressional inquiries that are taking place right now.
[03:51:59.692 --> 03:52:03.594]  Some of that's going to come out, but it's almost beside the point.
[03:52:03.594 --> 03:52:12.577]  I am afraid this is a two-sided doomsday thing, and I hate saying this, but it's a reality.
[03:52:12.577 --> 03:52:16.758]  We have the Earth, which is going to just continue to be
[03:52:18.729 --> 03:52:24.614]  Deteriorating internally and again, it's causing all of the weathers and all of that.
[03:52:24.614 --> 03:52:31.619]  Everything is directly from that's got nothing to do with if we stopped getting, you know, and went green, that's all baloney.
[03:52:31.619 --> 03:52:33.481]  There's just people making billions on that.
[03:52:33.481 --> 03:52:34.622]  That's a joke.
[03:52:34.622 --> 03:52:36.183]  That's got nothing to do with it.
[03:52:36.183 --> 03:52:37.904]  And nothing can change that.
[03:52:37.904 --> 03:52:39.746]  The Earth has run its time.
[03:52:41.019 --> 03:52:44.381]  And that includes our whole solar system for the most part.
[03:52:44.381 --> 03:52:51.847]  Although, I don't know, there's people trying to get into foreign planets, etc.
[03:52:51.847 --> 03:52:52.787]  Mars.
[03:52:52.787 --> 03:52:58.971]  We have spacecraft now that can fly at the speed of almost at light.
[03:52:58.971 --> 03:53:00.452]  We have them.
[03:53:00.452 --> 03:53:03.855]  We have been foreign alien entities.
[03:53:04.796 --> 03:53:11.023]  Are the ones that have they've been in bed with some people of our government.
[03:53:11.023 --> 03:53:13.725]  They tried Adolf Hitler.
[03:53:13.725 --> 03:53:25.738]  And fortunately, because he had, he had a flying saucer that flew, he had some assistance from aliens, that all of the crop circles.
[03:53:26.656 --> 03:53:33.537]  All of those unbelievable crop circles are creations of alien entities, period.
[03:53:33.537 --> 03:53:51.501]  They are a regular communication, which includes that with certain persons at Area 51 and above top secret operations, they are sending those crop circles and there's been like 14,000 of them at this point in time.
[03:53:51.501 --> 03:53:56.262]  I have videotapes that shows how they are created.
[03:53:57.037 --> 03:54:02.842]  And they're created with about a 36-inch diameter ball.
[03:54:02.842 --> 03:54:04.723]  It looks like stainless steel to us.
[03:54:04.723 --> 03:54:06.244]  I don't know what it is.
[03:54:06.244 --> 03:54:13.049]  They are alien weapons, if you want to make that reference as a weapon.
[03:54:13.049 --> 03:54:13.570]  It's not.
[03:54:13.570 --> 03:54:15.211]  It's actually a tool.
[03:54:15.211 --> 03:54:16.332]  They are alien.
[03:54:16.332 --> 03:54:18.513]  I have it on videotape.
[03:54:18.513 --> 03:54:20.035]  All right, Bob, we've got to get you back soon.
[03:54:20.035 --> 03:54:21.035]  You're an icon of liberty.
[03:54:21.035 --> 03:54:23.717]  We've got four or five calls left and only four minutes left.
[03:54:23.717 --> 03:54:25.219]  Let's try to jam in Bart in Georgia.
[03:54:25.219 --> 03:54:25.519]  Go ahead.
[03:54:27.179 --> 03:54:28.720]  Yes, sir.
[03:54:28.720 --> 03:54:33.762]  Fox News and Budweiser are weapons against the people, like you've said before.
[03:54:33.762 --> 03:54:35.863]  First, I have one thing to say to you, Alex.
[03:54:35.863 --> 03:54:40.886]  I think you should start selling home brewing supplies and pair it with your Alexa Pure.
[03:54:40.886 --> 03:54:43.127]  Put Hot Girls on the bottles.
[03:54:43.127 --> 03:54:52.591]  And to Mr. Fletcher, Fox News is really just a weapon against the American people, and I think in six months you won't be able to tell the difference between it and CNN.
[03:54:52.591 --> 03:54:53.992]  What do you think about that, sir?
[03:54:56.465 --> 03:55:04.152]  Well, that's the least of our concerns at this point, unfortunately.
[03:55:04.152 --> 03:55:16.905]  The bottom line is I have a very serious concern that within seven months we may have a nuclear war.
[03:55:17.785 --> 03:55:19.466]  That's a concern of mine.
[03:55:19.466 --> 03:55:22.367]  And I won't get into why I'm saying that.
[03:55:22.367 --> 03:55:28.330]  I will have to get back and do that under its own presentation, I guess.
[03:55:28.330 --> 03:55:37.174]  But there's a very spooky concern of mine that we're going to end up in a nuclear war.
[03:55:37.174 --> 03:55:38.935]  Well, we got to get you back on soon.
[03:55:38.935 --> 03:55:39.555]  Go ahead.
[03:55:39.555 --> 03:55:40.615]  Bart's gone.
[03:55:40.615 --> 03:55:41.776]  Greg in California, go ahead.
[03:55:43.836 --> 03:55:48.298]  I noticed in one of your clips that you were affiliated with the Militia of Montana.
[03:55:48.298 --> 03:55:53.319]  I think that was in the 90s when the militias were in the news quite a bit during the Clinton administration.
[03:55:53.319 --> 03:56:02.223]  I wonder if you had any status updates on how well organized that type of resistance would be right now?
[03:56:02.223 --> 03:56:02.563]  Sure.
[03:56:02.563 --> 03:56:03.263]  Closing comment.
[03:56:03.263 --> 03:56:04.263]  Thanks for the call.
[03:56:04.263 --> 03:56:05.184]  I'm sorry to Larry and Greg.
[03:56:05.184 --> 03:56:07.104]  We'll have to get back with Bob next time he's on.
[03:56:07.104 --> 03:56:08.625]  But a comment on the militia.
[03:56:10.393 --> 03:56:14.856]  Well, the militia, you know, people don't understand.
[03:56:14.856 --> 03:56:19.540]  I have the entire Senate inquiry.
[03:56:19.540 --> 03:56:28.966]  I have all of that that I'm going to try to make available through Alex, that you're seeing a little piece of right there.
[03:56:28.966 --> 03:56:31.688]  The militia
[03:56:32.963 --> 03:56:39.145]  The militia was just a bunch of angry American patriots, that's what it was.
[03:56:39.145 --> 03:56:53.509]  We utilized the name militia because the militias were what founded the original, what constituted the strength and arms that separated us from the king when we became united.
[03:56:53.509 --> 03:57:00.512]  Sure, power to the people and saying our government's been taken over, it's got bad aims for us and we are organizing at the grassroots to say no.
[03:57:00.512 --> 03:57:01.112]  Bob Fletcher?
[03:57:02.281 --> 03:57:03.962]  Don't have a website, don't have a P.O.
[03:57:03.962 --> 03:57:06.262]  Box, but we're gonna get you back home when you do have one.
[03:57:06.262 --> 03:57:11.924]  We love you, amazing interview, and you've been vindicated, and you've really contributed so much to society with your open, free mind.
[03:57:11.924 --> 03:57:18.446]  I don't agree with 100% of what you say, I agree with about 95% of it, but you're a really great guy, and I appreciate you and all you've done for humanity.
[03:57:19.679 --> 03:57:20.979]  Thank you.
[03:57:20.979 --> 03:57:31.322]  We'll get back and I'll get with you and we'll move forward with some things that you have never seen in your life that'll surprise you.
[03:57:31.322 --> 03:57:32.923]  I can't wait to have you back up in the next few weeks.
[03:57:32.923 --> 03:57:34.363]  Thank you so much.
[03:57:34.363 --> 03:57:35.824]  Thank you, Bob Fletcher.
[03:57:35.824 --> 03:57:37.964]  Owen Schroeder takes over in two minutes.
[03:57:37.964 --> 03:57:40.325]  Infowars.com forward slash show the war room.
[03:57:40.325 --> 03:57:42.066]  Everybody tune in and share the link.
[03:57:42.066 --> 03:57:42.726]  Thank you so much.
[03:57:42.726 --> 03:57:43.386]  Great job, everybody.
[03:57:55.296 --> 03:58:04.026]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food but also your health supplements because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[03:58:04.026 --> 03:58:06.208]  So support InfoWarsTore.
[03:58:06.208 --> 03:58:17.380]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know, I don't know, Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes and again magnesium is critical for your
[03:58:17.800 --> 03:58:19.321]  Muscles and everything.
[03:58:19.321 --> 03:58:20.221]  Krill oil.
[03:58:20.221 --> 03:58:28.003]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[03:58:28.003 --> 03:58:34.025]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come.
[03:58:34.025 --> 03:58:36.765]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[03:58:36.765 --> 03:58:38.946]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[03:58:38.946 --> 03:58:40.846]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[03:58:40.846 --> 03:58:44.207]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[03:58:44.207 --> 03:58:46.228]  You have to have these products.
[03:58:52.290 --> 03:58:53.691]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:58:53.691 --> 03:58:55.592]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:58:55.592 --> 03:58:56.212]  It is.
[03:58:56.212 --> 03:59:01.076]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:59:01.076 --> 03:59:02.436]  The fish oil is better than it.
[03:59:02.436 --> 03:59:04.258]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:59:04.258 --> 03:59:06.739]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[03:59:06.739 --> 03:59:08.380]  Brain, body, heart.
[03:59:08.380 --> 03:59:09.681]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[03:59:09.841 --> 03:59:13.405]  Crill oils is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm sorry.
[03:59:13.405 --> 03:59:14.526]  You want something like this?
[03:59:14.526 --> 03:59:15.507]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:59:15.507 --> 03:59:17.429]  The Crill is hallucinogenic.
[03:59:17.429 --> 03:59:18.010]  It's so good.
[03:59:18.010 --> 03:59:18.651]  In my view.
[03:59:18.651 --> 03:59:20.693]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:59:20.693 --> 03:59:27.060]  When I eat five capulets of Crill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:59:27.060 --> 03:59:31.644]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:59:34.571 --> 03:59:40.616]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:59:40.616 --> 03:59:41.697]  I just can't do it!
[03:59:41.697 --> 03:59:50.125]  You've overstored us!
[03:59:50.125 --> 03:59:54.088]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
